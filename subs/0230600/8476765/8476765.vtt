00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:06.816
[Grace] <i>Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably??</i>

2
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:08.985
<i>Then I'll begin.</i>

3
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:14.073
<i>This story started
many thousands of years ago,</i>

4
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.617
<i>but it was all over in just seven days.</i>

5
00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:19.412
<i>All that long, long time ago,</i>

6
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.539
<i>none of the things we can see now -</i>

7
00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.584
<i>The sun, the moon, the stars, the earth,</i>

8
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.377
<i>the animals and plants -</i>

9
00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.462
<i>Not a single one existed.</i>

10
00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:29.880
<i>Only God existed,</i>

11
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.633
<i>and so only he could have created them.</i>

12
00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:34.385
<i>And he did.</i>

13
00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.598
[screaming]

14
00:03:06.727 --> 00:03:09.730
[sobbing]

15
00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.905
[panting]

16
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.326
[gasping]

17
00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:42.680
[laughter in distance]

18
00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.476
[housekeeper]
Simpson. What a character he was.

19
00:03:47.643 --> 00:03:49.770
Wonder whatever became of him.

20
00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:52.106
[groundskeeper] Oh, I imagine
he's dead like all the rest.

21
00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.608
[housekeeper] Ah, those were the days.

22
00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.281
[bell rings]

23
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.245
<i>Mr. “fume, your hair.</i>

24
00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.499
[lock clicks]

25
00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:15.629
Yes?

26
00:04:15.796 --> 00:04:18.632
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the <i>-.</i>

27
00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.551
Oh, yes, of course.

28
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:23.637
Come in.

29
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.266
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

30
00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:36.192
Hmm. You are?

31
00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:38.778
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

32
00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:40.780
<i>And MS is Edmund “Yuma.</i>

33
00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.448
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

34
00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.783
You must be the gardener.

35
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.410
Ah, that's right. The gardener.

36
00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:49.914
And, uh, this young lady is called Lydia.

37
00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.125
Have you had much experience in service?

38
00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:56.086
Oh, don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

39
00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:58.339
She's older than she looks.

40
00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:00.257
Can you iron?

41
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.678
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

42
00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:08.224
Uh, she can't talk, ma'am.

43
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.684
The poor little mite's a mute.

44
00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:12.269
Oh.

45
00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:15.064
Oh, but she's a good little worker.
I can promise you that.

46
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.191
All right.

47
00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:20.569
All right. The other girl I had
spoke too much, anyway.

48
00:05:20.736 --> 00:05:21.821
Follow me.

49
00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:23.322
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl,

50
00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:26.075
you will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

51
00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.202
And, uh, you, Mr...

52
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.287
- Tuttle, ma'am.
- Ah, Tuttle.

53
00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:33.791
Uh, you could sleep in the shed
around the back.

54
00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:37.253
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected

55
00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.713
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

56
00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:42.174
You mean they just vanished?

57
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.467
[Grace] Into thin air.

58
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:47.012
No notice, nothing.
They didn't even collect their wages.

59
00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:49.974
They - They just left us.

60
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.809
What a strange thing to do.

61
00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:54.436
You'll soon find out there are times

62
00:05:54.603 --> 00:05:56.856
when this house
is not exactly an ideal home.

63
00:05:57.773 --> 00:06:03.195
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper
requesting honest, hardworking people.

64
00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.823
Well, there's nobody more honest
or hardworking than us.

65
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.449
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

66
00:06:07.616 --> 00:06:09.451
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

67
00:06:09.618 --> 00:06:12.621
And, urn, very hardworking.

68
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:17.001
The kitchen.

69
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:19.962
I have breakfast at 8:00,

70
00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.797
the children at 9:00.

71
00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:25.175
Lunch will be served at 1:00
and dinner at half past 7:00.

72
00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:26.802
[Mrs. Mills] And the master, ma'am?

73
00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:31.974
The master went off to war

74
00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:34.518
a year and a half ago.

75
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.771
I've had no news since the war ended.

76
00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.316
Which of you does the cooking?

77
00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:41.817
[Mrs. Mills] I'm so sorry, ma'am.

78
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.570
Which of you does the cooking?

79
00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.322
You'll notice what I'm doing.

80
00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:50.200
In this house, no door must be opened

81
00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:52.453
without the previous one
being closed first.

82
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.914
It is vital that you remember this.

83
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.082
It is not as easy as it may seem.

84
00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:00.127
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors,

85
00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.880
depending on which area of the house
you are in at the time.

86
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.300
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards,

87
00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:08.636
I will be leaving a set of keys
in your charge.

88
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:10.346
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:07:11.221 --> 00:07:12.389
The music room.

90
00:07:12.556 --> 00:07:14.516
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

91
00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:17.603
Please do not let the children
thump away on it.

92
00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:20.648
It sets off my migraine.

93
00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:24.401
Silence is something that we prize
very highly in this house.

94
00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:27.905
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio,

95
00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:30.282
or anything else that makes a racket.

96
00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.534
Uh, we don't have electricity, either.

97
00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:34.828
During the war,
the Germans kept cutting it off,

98
00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:36.747
so we just learned to live without it.

99
00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.123
Let's continue.

100
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.376
Ma'am, there's really no need
to show us around the whole house -

101
00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:41.460
[Grace] Yes!

102
00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:43.504
Yes, there is.

103
00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:47.257
Because here, most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

104
00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:48.467
It's often difficult to make out

105
00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:51.720
if there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

106
00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:56.433
or one of my children
playing hide-and-seek.

107
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.310
Wh-What do you mean, ma'am?

108
00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.731
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

109
00:08:08.904 --> 00:08:12.157
Mr. Tuttle, you can see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.

110
00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:13.325
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:15.953
You two could start closing the curtains.

112
00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.038
All of them.

113
00:08:48.068 --> 00:08:49.278
Come.

114
00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.499
I'll wake them. You wait here.

115
00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.253
Whatever you do, don't open the curtains.

116
00:09:09.798 --> 00:09:12.009
Wakey-wakey.

117
00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:14.094
- [child stirring]
- [Grace chuckles]

118
00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:16.013
Now, come on.

119
00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.849
Eyes closed, hands together.

120
00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:22.478
[children] Let it be, at light of day,

121
00:09:22.644 --> 00:09:24.730
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

122
00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.982
Blessed be the Virgin pure,

123
00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.318
whom I greet with faith so sure.

124
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.612
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose,

125
00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.114
keep us fill this day doth close.

126
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.914
[Grace] They're still half asleep.

127
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.500
What sweet little children.

128
00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:49.088
Well, what do you say?

129
00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.131
How do you do?

130
00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.133
How do you do?

131
00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:55.969
How do you do, children?

132
00:09:56.887 --> 00:10:01.350
My name is Mrs. Mills,
but you can call me Bertha if you like.

133
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.310
What are your names?

134
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:06.271
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

135
00:10:06.438 --> 00:10:07.773
Anne and Nicholas.

136
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.818
What pretty names.

137
00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:13.028
Are you going to be our new nanny?

138
00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:15.614
Mm-hmm.

139
00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:20.119
Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny.

140
00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:21.912
It's time for their breakfast.

141
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.540
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

142
00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:30.671
[sighs]

143
00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.007
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

144
00:10:34.174 --> 00:10:35.300
For what?

145
00:10:36.426 --> 00:10:37.636
Their condition.

146
00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:41.974
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

147
00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.017
They are photosensitive

148
00:10:44.184 --> 00:10:47.104
and they must never be exposed
to any light much stronger than this.

149
00:10:48.438 --> 00:10:52.276
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes,
they will break out in sores and blisters

150
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.945
and begin to suffocate.

151
00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:56.697
It would eventually be fatal.

152
00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.157
[Mrs. Mills] Good heavens.

153
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.785
I don't like this toast.

154
00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:03.579
Oh? Why not?

155
00:11:03.745 --> 00:11:05.080
It tastes funny.

156
00:11:05.914 --> 00:11:07.624
I liked it better before.

157
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:11.545
Well, that's because before,
somebody else made it.

158
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:14.381
When are they coming back?

159
00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:17.926
They're not coming back, child.

160
00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.262
Just like Daddy.

161
00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:23.473
Daddy is coming back, though.

162
00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:27.853
Mrs. Mills, our father's
fighting in a war in France, you know.

163
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.021
[Nicholas] It's the World War.

164
00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.064
I know, but he's in France.

165
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.401
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

166
00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:37.571
Are you going to leave us too?

167
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:41.074
Of course not.

168
00:11:42.409 --> 00:11:44.161
Why should I leave you?

169
00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:47.414
The others said they wouldn't,
but they did.

170
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:48.957
And then it happened.

171
00:11:49.124 --> 00:11:50.292
Be quiet.

172
00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:55.547
What do you mean, Anne? What happened?

173
00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:01.220
Mummy went... mad.

174
00:12:01.386 --> 00:12:03.847
- [Nicholas] Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

175
00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.849
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

176
00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:07.142
[Grace] Be quiet.

177
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.230
What's going on?

178
00:12:12.022 --> 00:12:15.025
I want to see those plates empty
in less than a minute. Is that clear?

179
00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:20.864
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

180
00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:22.616
I'd like a word with you.

181
00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:26.203
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.751
The postman usually comes every Wednesday.

183
00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.880
But I just checked the letter box,
and this week he hasn't.

184
00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:40.467
I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.

185
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.094
This letter should have been collected

186
00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.554
and delivered to the newspaper
five days ago.

187
00:12:44.721 --> 00:12:47.474
It's an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never published,

188
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.102
would you mind explaining to me
what you're doing here?

189
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.687
Oh, I understand. [Chuckles]

190
00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:56.191
Well, ma'am, that's exactly
what I was going to say to you

191
00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.859
when you opened the door to us.

192
00:12:58.026 --> 00:13:01.947
The truth is that we just come by
on the off chance.

193
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.077
You know, a big house like this is always
in need of someone who knows the ropes.

194
00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:09.621
You mean, you've served in a house
like this one before?

195
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:12.499
This may come
as a surprise to you, ma'am, but...

196
00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:16.336
we, in fact, used to work here.

197
00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:19.256
Here?

198
00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:21.758
Oh, now, 'twas a few years ago.

199
00:13:23.927 --> 00:13:28.765
If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am,
they were the best years of my life.

200
00:13:30.517 --> 00:13:35.439
That's why we come by,
because this house... means a lot to us.

201
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:38.608
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

202
00:13:38.775 --> 00:13:41.153
No, no, no. Don't bother. There's no need.

203
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.739
Uh, so you say you know the house well?

204
00:13:43.905 --> 00:13:45.991
Like the back of my hand.

205
00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:49.119
Well, that is always assuming
that the walls haven't sprouted legs

206
00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:51.330
and moved in the meantime.

207
00:13:51.496 --> 00:13:53.749
The only thing
that moves here is the light.

208
00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:59.046
[sighs] But it changes everything.

209
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:06.345
It's rather difficult, to say the least.

210
00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:11.350
One might almost say... unbearable.

211
00:14:14.394 --> 00:14:17.564
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

212
00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:19.941
Oh, yes, ma'am.

213
00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:21.860
I don't like fantasies.

214
00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:25.030
Strange ideas. Do you know what I mean?

215
00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:28.158
I think so, ma'am.

216
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.869
My children sometimes have strange ideas.

217
00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:34.998
But you mustn't pay any attention to them.

218
00:14:35.957 --> 00:14:37.376
Children will be children.

219
00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:40.420
Yes, of course, ma'am.

220
00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:42.464
All right.

221
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:45.801
You can stay.

222
00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:49.221
Thank you very much, ma'am.

223
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.609
It did happen.

224
00:15:13.453 --> 00:15:16.998
"The Roman governor tried to make them
change their minds afterwards -."

225
00:15:17.165 --> 00:15:19.918
Mmm. "To make them change
their minds." Full stop.

226
00:15:20.752 --> 00:15:22.546
- "Afterwards..." Mm-hmm.
- "Afterwards,

227
00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:24.172
he ordered them to be beaten.

228
00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:28.260
But Justus and Pastor,
far from being afraid,

229
00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:31.221
rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

230
00:15:31.388 --> 00:15:34.182
When he saw this,
the Roman governor was filled with rage

231
00:15:34.349 --> 00:15:36.184
"and ordered their heads to be cutoff."

232
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:37.727
[giggling]

233
00:15:40.188 --> 00:15:41.606
[snickering]

234
00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:43.483
What do you find so amusing?

235
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:46.736
Well...

236
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.738
Well, what?

237
00:15:48.905 --> 00:15:51.283
Those children were really stupid.

238
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.368
Why?

239
00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.454
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus

240
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.372
and then they got killed for it.

241
00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:00.333
And what would you have done? Deny Christ?

242
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.710
[Anne] Well, yes.

243
00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:06.590
Inside, I would have believed in him,
but I wouldn't have told the Romans that.

244
00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:11.428
Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?

245
00:16:15.348 --> 00:16:16.433
I see.

246
00:16:17.934 --> 00:16:21.146
So you both would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

247
00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:22.564
Oh, you'd have saved your heads

248
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.900
being chopped off by the Romans,
that's true.

249
00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:27.402
But what would have happened afterwards?

250
00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:28.487
When?

251
00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:30.614
In the next life.

252
00:16:31.364 --> 00:16:33.033
The one that's waiting for us
after we die.

253
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.951
- Where would you have gone?
- Oh.

254
00:16:35.118 --> 00:16:36.036
Ah.

255
00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:37.829
Where, Nicholas?

256
00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.789
To the children's limbo.

257
00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:41.583
What is the children's limbo, Anne?

258
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.419
- One of the four hells.
- Which are?

259
00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.839
[gasps]

260
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:50.217
Me, me, me, me! Me!

261
00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:52.761
No, no, no. Let him answer. Which are?

262
00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:55.472
There's the hell where the damned go.

263
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.558
- Then there's purgatory...
- Yes.

264
00:16:58.725 --> 00:17:00.852
...and the bosom of Abraham
where the just go,

265
00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.437
and limbo where children go.

266
00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:04.064
At the center of the earth.

267
00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:06.107
Where it's very, very hot.

268
00:17:07.108 --> 00:17:08.693
That's where children go who tell lies.

269
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.738
But they don't just go there
for a few days. Oh, no.

270
00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:15.867
No, they're damned. Forever.

271
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.869
Think about it.

272
00:17:19.454 --> 00:17:23.625
Try to imagine the end of eternity.

273
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:25.460
Close your eyes.

274
00:17:26.586 --> 00:17:28.797
Close your eyes and try to imagine it.

275
00:17:30.131 --> 00:17:31.550
Forever.

276
00:17:33.593 --> 00:17:36.846
Pain... forever.

277
00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:39.891
I'm getting dizzy.

278
00:17:40.892 --> 00:17:42.352
[sighs, chuckles]

279
00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:45.730
Now do you understand
why Justus and Pastor told the truth?

280
00:17:49.693 --> 00:17:50.944
[sighs] Right.

281
00:17:51.778 --> 00:17:55.115
Uh, open your readers at lesson six.

282
00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:57.826
- Can't we go and play?
- You most certainly cannot.

283
00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:02.247
First, you're going to read the lesson.
Then you're going to learn it by heart.

284
00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.374
- All of it?
- Anne, any more protests

285
00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:06.918
and there'll be no playing
for you at all today, hmm?

286
00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:10.672
In fact, I think you can study
in separate rooms.

287
00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:13.341
- [both] No, no, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

288
00:18:13.508 --> 00:18:14.968
But we get scared if we're separated.

289
00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:18.388
You get scared? As if you weren't
used to this house by now.

290
00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:20.181
What if we see a ghost?

291
00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:23.351
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories?

292
00:18:23.518 --> 00:18:25.103
I haven't told him anything!

293
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.023
If you see a ghost, you say, "Hello,"
and you continue on studying.

294
00:18:28.189 --> 00:18:30.358
- Anne, come with me to the music room.
- Why me?

295
00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:32.277
Because I say so! Now come on.

296
00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:33.612
Take your book.

297
00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:37.574
Nicholas, I want to see
that lesson learned in less than an hour.

298
00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.993
- Mummy?
- What?

299
00:18:41.202 --> 00:18:42.287
Give me a kiss.

300
00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:45.248
"Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss. Give me a ki -"

301
00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.167
Anne, wait for me outside.

302
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:49.461
You know I can't.

303
00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.672
Over there.

304
00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:58.303
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

305
00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:01.139
My daughter is going to
cross the living room.

306
00:19:01.806 --> 00:19:03.016
Yes, ma'am.

307
00:19:10.815 --> 00:19:11.900
All right, Anne.

308
00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:14.944
[Anne humming]

309
00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:16.279
Darling...

310
00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:20.659
Mummy can't be with you all the time.

311
00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:21.785
Mmm?

312
00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:26.623
- You must learn to be on your own.
- [Anne continues humming, faint]

313
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:29.250
Where's your rosary?

314
00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:31.711
Ah!

315
00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:35.507
Whenever you feel afraid...

316
00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:39.260
I want you to squeeze it
with all your might

317
00:19:39.427 --> 00:19:42.847
and say an Our Father,
and then your fear will go away.

318
00:19:43.014 --> 00:19:45.934
- It won't.
- Yes. Yes, it will. Honestly.

319
00:19:47.894 --> 00:19:50.522
Don't you see that when you do that,
the Lord is with you?

320
00:19:52.315 --> 00:19:54.150
There's no reason to be afraid.

321
00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.545
[lock clicks]

322
00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:16.881
[footsteps departing]

323
00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:21.886
[door opening, closing in distance]

324
00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:35.900
[Nicholas] "The house and the family."

325
00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.779
We all live in a house with our family.

326
00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:43.867
The family is usually made up
of parents, children

327
00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:45.535
and their grandparents.

328
00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.829
"We must be obedient and kind..."

329
00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:51.082
[Anne] "...obedient and kind towards
other members of our family

330
00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:55.170
and we must never argue or fight
with our brothers and sisters."

331
00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:59.090
- Do you have any children?
- No.

332
00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:02.594
Mr. Tuttle and the girl, Lydia,
are all I've got,

333
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:05.263
and, uh, I'm all they've got.

334
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.140
[Grace] Was she born like that?

335
00:21:08.349 --> 00:21:09.893
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

336
00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:12.812
The girl. Was she born a mute?

337
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.981
No.

338
00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:19.194
You know, I think I've finished here,
ma'am.

339
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.406
If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go
and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

340
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.456
[hinge creaks]

341
00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:32.832
[door closes]

342
00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:38.129
[sighs]

343
00:21:42.091 --> 00:21:44.469
[child whimpering]

344
00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:54.062
[child crying]

345
00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:55.146
Nicholas!

346
00:22:00.443 --> 00:22:02.070
Nicholas, I'm coming!

347
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.491
Oh!

348
00:22:09.452 --> 00:22:11.371
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

349
00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:14.624
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying. I was reading.

350
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.918
But I just heard you...

351
00:22:17.585 --> 00:22:19.546
Anne! Anne.

352
00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:22.715
- [door closes]
- [crying continues]

353
00:22:26.427 --> 00:22:27.428
Anne!

354
00:22:29.722 --> 00:22:30.723
Anne?

355
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:33.226
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.

356
00:22:33.893 --> 00:22:35.895
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

357
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.566
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying.

358
00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.318
I just heard you a moment ago.

359
00:22:44.028 --> 00:22:45.947
There's no need to feel ashamed, darling.

360
00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:47.407
I don't.

361
00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:49.659
If I'd been crying, I'd tell you.

362
00:22:49.826 --> 00:22:51.995
Oh, really? So I imagined it, did I?

363
00:22:52.161 --> 00:22:53.705
No. It was that boy.

364
00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:57.750
- What boy?
- Victor.

365
00:22:59.043 --> 00:23:00.128
Who's Victor?

366
00:23:01.504 --> 00:23:03.590
The boy that was here a moment ago.

367
00:23:03.756 --> 00:23:07.552
I told him to let me study,
but he wouldn't stop crying.

368
00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.637
I think he's a spoiled brat.

369
00:23:09.804 --> 00:23:11.973
He said we'd have to leave the house.

370
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.558
Oh, did he, now?

371
00:23:14.517 --> 00:23:15.894
And why was he crying?

372
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.314
Because he doesn't like this house
but he has to live here.

373
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.565
His father's a pianist <i>-.</i>

374
00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:23.067
- Oh! His father's a pianist, is he?
- Yes.

375
00:23:23.234 --> 00:23:26.487
And I've already told him
he is not allowed to touch the piano.

376
00:23:26.654 --> 00:23:28.072
He isn't, is he, Mummy?

377
00:23:28.239 --> 00:23:29.532
[sighs]

378
00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:31.784
So, you've spoken to his father as well?

379
00:23:31.951 --> 00:23:35.204
No, only with Victor.
His father's with the others in the hall.

380
00:23:35.371 --> 00:23:37.457
But I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.

381
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.211
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

382
00:23:42.378 --> 00:23:44.589
That'll do, Anne! That's enough!

383
00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:48.635
- Now why were you crying?
- It was Victor!

384
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:51.346
- So where is he now?
- He went out through there!

385
00:23:51.512 --> 00:23:53.139
Would you mind telling me how a boy

386
00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:55.642
can get in and out of this room
if it's locked?

387
00:23:58.061 --> 00:23:59.270
[gasps]

388
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.482
I thought I made myself quite clear.

389
00:24:03.524 --> 00:24:04.859
No door is to be opened

390
00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:06.778
without the previous one
being closed first.

391
00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.863
Is that so hard to understand?

392
00:24:09.572 --> 00:24:11.074
This house is like a ship.

393
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.159
The light must be contained
as if it were water

394
00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:15.662
by opening and closing the doors.

395
00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:19.290
- My children's lives are at stake.
- [Mrs. Mills] But, ma'am, I-.

396
00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:21.376
Do not argue with me! Be quiet!

397
00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:24.587
Now, which was the last of you
to enter that room?

398
00:24:25.546 --> 00:24:26.547
Lydia?

399
00:24:29.258 --> 00:24:31.386
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.

400
00:24:31.552 --> 00:24:33.304
Oh, that leaves you, then.

401
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.431
But I was in the hall the whole time.

402
00:24:35.598 --> 00:24:37.892
And then I went out into the garden.
You saw me with your own eyes.

403
00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:40.395
I hope you are not suggesting
that it was me.

404
00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:44.023
Do you think that I would overlook
such a thing

405
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.484
and endanger the life of my own daughter?

406
00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:55.618
You're not supposed to read at the table.

407
00:24:56.911 --> 00:24:58.037
Oh, really?

408
00:24:58.204 --> 00:25:00.540
Who's going to tell Mummy? You?

409
00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:07.088
Or perhaps you? [Giggles]

410
00:25:11.718 --> 00:25:13.344
Did you really see a boy?

411
00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.222
Yes. He's called Victor.

412
00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:20.435
Is he a ghost?

413
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:23.396
Don't be stupid. Ghosts aren't like that.

414
00:25:23.563 --> 00:25:24.689
What are they like?

415
00:25:25.398 --> 00:25:27.442
I've told you a thousand times.

416
00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:30.486
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

417
00:25:30.653 --> 00:25:33.239
- How do you know?
- Because I've seen them.

418
00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:34.699
They come out at night.

419
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.702
Fibber. Where?

420
00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:40.163
[gasps]

421
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.040
[laughing]

422
00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:47.128
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

423
00:25:47.754 --> 00:25:50.923
- Well, I don't believe you saw that boy.
- Believe what you like.

424
00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.009
You'll soon be begging us
to play with you.

425
00:26:06.355 --> 00:26:08.441
[whispers] Nicholas. Nicholas.

426
00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:11.235
[Nicholas] Huh? What?

427
00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:13.362
Look.

428
00:26:14.363 --> 00:26:16.282
Why have you opened the curtains?

429
00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:18.242
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

430
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:22.121
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.

431
00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:25.166
You're lying. Going to tell Mummy.

432
00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:27.627
- So I'm a liar, am I?
- Yes.

433
00:26:28.711 --> 00:26:32.548
Victor, come out from behind that curtain
so my stupid brother can see you.

434
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.677
[breathing heavily]

435
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:41.599
[gasps]

436
00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:44.185
Leave me alone.

437
00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:46.187
[Anne] 80 you don't want
to see him now, eh?

438
00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:48.064
You're a cowardly custard.

439
00:26:48.231 --> 00:26:49.607
Cowardly, cowardly custard.

440
00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:51.859
Cowardly, cowardly custard.

441
00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:55.947
I'll just have to do it myself, then.

442
00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:09.919
[footsteps running]

443
00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:11.087
[Nicholas gasps]

444
00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:15.174
[Anne whispers] That's enough, Victor.

445
00:27:18.344 --> 00:27:20.179
Nicholas. Nicholas.

446
00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:22.932
Tell him to leave the curtains alone.
He won't listen to me.

447
00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:25.226
[Victor] Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.

448
00:27:25.393 --> 00:27:27.103
[Anne] This is our bed.

449
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.688
[Victor] No, it's mine.

450
00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:31.899
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.

451
00:27:32.066 --> 00:27:34.152
You be quiet, cowardly custard.

452
00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:37.989
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'll call my mother

453
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.907
and she'll kick you out.

454
00:27:40.074 --> 00:27:41.534
You don't know my mother.

455
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:43.536
[Victor] And you don't know my parents.

456
00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:46.414
Anne, I'm going to tell Mummy about you.

457
00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:48.791
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me?

458
00:27:50.084 --> 00:27:52.420
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

459
00:27:53.796 --> 00:27:56.632
[breathing heavily]

460
00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:01.846
[screams]

461
00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:04.140
[screaming]

462
00:28:04.307 --> 00:28:06.559
[Nicholas] Help, Mummy! Help!

463
00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:08.561
Help! Help, Mummy!

464
00:28:08.728 --> 00:28:11.355
- What is it? What is it?
- Help! Help!

465
00:28:11.522 --> 00:28:14.150
- [whimpering]
- What is it?

466
00:28:14.317 --> 00:28:17.778
She was fighting with me,
and I told her to be quiet.

467
00:28:17.945 --> 00:28:20.406
I'm fed up. Do you hear me?

468
00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:21.908
I am fed up with you!

469
00:28:22.074 --> 00:28:23.659
I didn't do anything!

470
00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:32.210
"Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth
from the Garden of Eden

471
00:28:32.376 --> 00:28:34.921
to fill the ground
from whence he was taken.

472
00:28:35.087 --> 00:28:36.839
So he drove out the man

473
00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:40.426
and placed to the east
of the Garden of Eden cherubims

474
00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:44.931
"and a flaming sword which turned every
way to keep the way of the tree of life."

475
00:28:45.556 --> 00:28:47.558
- There. I finished.
- [book closes]

476
00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:50.311
Very good.

477
00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:55.524
[sighs] Now you can ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

478
00:28:55.691 --> 00:28:58.903
What? That's not what we agreed!

479
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.072
We didn't agree anything, young lady.

480
00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:03.908
Today you're being punished,
and you'll do as I say.

481
00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:05.993
You can't make me
ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

482
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.453
How dare you.

483
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.706
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do!

484
00:29:10.873 --> 00:29:12.875
You told your brother
there was someone else in the room.

485
00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:14.335
- There was!
- You're lying!

486
00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:16.545
- I am not!
- [sighs]

487
00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:18.422
Anne...

488
00:29:19.674 --> 00:29:22.635
Anne, do you remember the story
about Justus and Pastor?

489
00:29:23.344 --> 00:29:25.930
Children who don't tell the truth
end up in limbo.

490
00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:28.015
That's what you say.

491
00:29:28.182 --> 00:29:32.144
But I read the other day that limbo's only
for children who haven't been baptized.

492
00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:34.438
And I have!

493
00:29:36.607 --> 00:29:39.777
[Anne] "And Abraham took the wood
of the burnt offering"

494
00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:42.655
and laid it upon Isaac, his son.

495
00:29:42.822 --> 00:29:46.200
And he took the fire in his hand
and a knife,

496
00:29:46.367 --> 00:29:48.536
and they went, both of them together.

497
00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:53.582
And Isaac spake unto Abraham, his father,
and said, 'My father.'

498
00:29:53.749 --> 00:29:56.794
And he said, 'Here I am, my son.'
And he -...

499
00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:14.228
Did you look in on Nicholas?

500
00:30:14.395 --> 00:30:18.107
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

501
00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:22.194
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?

502
00:30:22.862 --> 00:30:24.071
Oh, yes, ma'am.

503
00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:29.785
I prefer to have her where I can see her,
but I can't embroider in such poor light.

504
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:35.833
How long is this punishment
going to go on?

505
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.585
It's been three days now.

506
00:30:37.752 --> 00:30:38.878
It's up to her.

507
00:30:41.088 --> 00:30:44.216
She's got to learn to swallow her pride
and ask for forgiveness.

508
00:30:45.634 --> 00:30:47.970
Anyway, it's about time
she started to read the Bible.

509
00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:52.516
Mmm. Well, the priest will be very pleased
to hear that, ma'am.

510
00:30:52.683 --> 00:30:54.518
If he ever deigns to pay us another visit.

511
00:30:54.685 --> 00:30:56.937
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

512
00:30:57.104 --> 00:31:00.232
He told me yesterday
he'd be by as soon as possible.

513
00:31:01.108 --> 00:31:04.111
[sighs] I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

514
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.823
This fog doesn't exactly help.

515
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.617
It's never lasted this long before.

516
00:31:09.784 --> 00:31:11.744
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

517
00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:13.829
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

518
00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:18.042
Anne!

519
00:31:19.251 --> 00:31:20.920
Anne, I can't hear you.

520
00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:23.964
[Anne] "And Isaac spake unto Abraham..."

521
00:31:24.131 --> 00:31:25.549
[sighs] Oh!

522
00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:27.551
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills,

523
00:31:27.718 --> 00:31:30.679
I've had to put up with the noise of Lydia
running around above my head.

524
00:31:30.846 --> 00:31:32.640
She - She's been hurtling
backwards and forwards

525
00:31:32.807 --> 00:31:34.392
as if there were three of her.

526
00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:36.352
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary

527
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:38.979
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

528
00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:41.982
I couldn't bear to get
another migraine attack.

529
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:43.734
I'll tell her, ma'am.

530
00:31:44.693 --> 00:31:45.903
[Grace] Thank you.

531
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.447
[Anne continues reading, faint]

532
00:31:55.287 --> 00:31:58.290
[Anne]
"And Abraham stretched forth his hand

533
00:31:58.457 --> 00:32:01.168
and took the knife to slay his son.

534
00:32:01.335 --> 00:32:03.921
And the angel of the Lord called..."

535
00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:07.007
[thumping, floorboards creaking overhead]

536
00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:11.387
[Anne continues reading, faint]

537
00:32:15.891 --> 00:32:18.269
[thumping, creaking continues]

538
00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.353
[sighs]

539
00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:23.524
- [thumping, creaking intensifies]
- [gasps]

540
00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:30.448
- [chandelier rattling]
- [footsteps running]

541
00:32:30.614 --> 00:32:32.450
[object clatters overhead]

542
00:32:32.616 --> 00:32:34.743
Now she's really gone too far.

543
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.580
Lydia. Lydia!

544
00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:47.173
[no audible dialogue]

545
00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:57.433
[Anne continues reading]

546
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.895
"...in the mount of the Lord,
it shall be seen.

547
00:33:01.061 --> 00:33:03.814
-And the angel of the Lord -"
-What's going on up there?

548
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:06.692
Nothing, Mummy.
I'm just reading like you told me.

549
00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:09.612
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

550
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.496
"And the angel of the Lord
called unto Abraham out of heaven

551
00:33:18.662 --> 00:33:20.623
the second time and said,

552
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:22.833
'By myself, I have sworn, '
saith the Lord -...

553
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.126
Shh!

554
00:33:28.422 --> 00:33:29.840
[door opens in distance]

555
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.931
- What was that?
- I don't know.

556
00:33:37.806 --> 00:33:40.559
Anne, tell me who's making that noise.

557
00:33:40.726 --> 00:33:42.186
I can't tell you, Mummy.

558
00:33:43.062 --> 00:33:44.480
You tell me.

559
00:33:44.647 --> 00:33:48.317
I told you there was someone in the room
and you punished me.

560
00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:51.237
- Now I don't know what to say.
- Anne, I want the truth.

561
00:33:53.322 --> 00:33:55.407
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.

562
00:33:58.118 --> 00:33:59.995
There. In that junk room.

563
00:34:45.457 --> 00:34:47.585
[door hinge creaks]

564
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:51.714
Mummy, you're letting the light in.

565
00:34:52.339 --> 00:34:53.465
[gasps]

566
00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:13.319
[glass shards crunch, clink]

567
00:35:38.344 --> 00:35:41.972
[raspy breathing]

568
00:35:44.391 --> 00:35:48.395
[voices whispering]

569
00:35:50.689 --> 00:35:51.982
[voice 1] Shh!

570
00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:54.693
- She's watching us.
- [voice 2] She's watching us.

571
00:35:55.986 --> 00:35:57.780
- [snarling]
- [gasps]

572
00:35:58.697 --> 00:35:59.823
Oh!

573
00:36:09.875 --> 00:36:10.918
[gasps]

574
00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:14.213
[door hinge creaking]

575
00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:19.635
Where did they go?

576
00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:21.845
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?

577
00:36:22.012 --> 00:36:23.681
Which way did they go?

578
00:36:23.847 --> 00:36:26.600
Over there, over there -
Oh, and down there as well.

579
00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:27.810
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

580
00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:31.146
- [voices whispering]
- [doors closing]

581
00:36:33.148 --> 00:36:36.026
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

582
00:36:36.985 --> 00:36:39.988
And they say they're going
to take the curtains down as well.

583
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.910
- Ma'am, stay calm, please.
- I will not stay calm!

584
00:36:45.077 --> 00:36:46.787
For five whole years
during the occupation,

585
00:36:46.954 --> 00:36:49.498
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
ever stepping foot in this house,

586
00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:51.458
and now there is someone here,
under my nose,

587
00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:53.127
opening and closing the doors.

588
00:36:53.293 --> 00:36:55.754
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

589
00:36:55.921 --> 00:36:58.298
Why, the floorboards squeak
and the plumbing clanks <i>-.</i>

590
00:36:58.465 --> 00:37:00.509
- There were voices. I'm telling you.
- [Anne] Mummy, look.

591
00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:02.386
A boy and two women,
and they were talking together.

592
00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:03.887
Mummy, look!

593
00:37:06.765 --> 00:37:08.183
I did it yesterday.

594
00:37:08.892 --> 00:37:10.561
This is the father, this is the mother,

595
00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:13.897
this is Victor, and this is the old woman.

596
00:37:14.064 --> 00:37:16.024
What do these numbers stand for?

597
00:37:16.191 --> 00:37:18.152
[Anne] That's the number of times
I've seen them.

598
00:37:18.318 --> 00:37:20.654
I've seen the old woman the most.

599
00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:26.869
Oh, God in heaven.

600
00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:28.495
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr. Tuttle.

601
00:37:28.662 --> 00:37:30.789
Tell him that we have to search
the whole house immediately.

602
00:37:30.956 --> 00:37:33.333
- Before it gets dark.
- Yes, ma'am. There, now.

603
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.335
- Mummy!
- Yes, darling. It's all right.

604
00:37:35.502 --> 00:37:38.714
Nothing's going to happen to you
while Mummy's here. Hmm?

605
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:41.925
[Anne] Look, Mummy. She really scares me.

606
00:37:42.092 --> 00:37:44.887
It's as if she's not looking at you,
but she can see you.

607
00:37:45.053 --> 00:37:47.806
And she's always around saying,
"Come with me."

608
00:37:47.973 --> 00:37:49.516
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

609
00:37:49.683 --> 00:37:52.311
Honestly, Mummy. And she asks me things.

610
00:37:52.478 --> 00:37:54.688
Victor told me she's a witch.

611
00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:57.691
- [Grace] What does she ask you?
- Things.

612
00:37:59.943 --> 00:38:01.820
Her breath smells.

613
00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.951
We have to open all the curtains.

614
00:38:08.118 --> 00:38:10.287
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

615
00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:11.371
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:38:11.538 --> 00:38:13.916
You both search the right side,
and I'll take the left.

617
00:38:14.082 --> 00:38:15.292
Then we'll search upstairs.

618
00:38:31.016 --> 00:38:33.936
[curtains opening]

619
00:38:54.164 --> 00:38:55.707
[curtains open]

620
00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:07.928
[sighs]

621
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.701
[Nicholas] <i>Perhaps they're ghosts
who lived in this house before.</i>

622
00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:33.412
Don't be stupid. I've already told you.

623
00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:36.957
Ghosts go about in white sheets
and carry chains and go, "Ooh."

624
00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:38.959
- [whimpers]
- [Mrs. Mills] Now, Anne.

625
00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:41.670
Why do you make up such stories?

626
00:39:41.837 --> 00:39:43.881
I don't. I read them in books.

627
00:39:44.047 --> 00:39:46.884
Well, you shouldn't believe everything
that you read in books.

628
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.760
That's what our mother says.

629
00:39:48.927 --> 00:39:52.055
She says that all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish.

630
00:39:52.222 --> 00:39:56.268
And then, she expects us to believe
everything written in the Bible.

631
00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:59.062
- And don't you believe it?
- I believe some things.

632
00:39:59.229 --> 00:40:04.109
But, for example, I don't believe
that God made the world in seven days.

633
00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:08.530
And I don't believe that Noah
got all those animals into one boat,

634
00:40:08.697 --> 00:40:10.657
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

635
00:40:10.824 --> 00:40:13.076
No, I don't believe that either.

636
00:40:13.243 --> 00:40:16.455
- [Anne] Doves are anything but holy.
- They poo on our windows.

637
00:40:16.622 --> 00:40:17.831
[chuckles]

638
00:40:22.252 --> 00:40:25.881
Have you mentioned any of this
to your mother?

639
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:31.762
Oh.

640
00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.156
- [knocking]
- [Mrs. Mills] Ma'am?

641
00:41:33.907 --> 00:41:34.950
Yes?

642
00:41:36.034 --> 00:41:39.121
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.
There's no one.

643
00:41:39.287 --> 00:41:40.539
I see.

644
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.418
Mrs. Mills.

645
00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:47.379
Yes, ma'am?

646
00:41:48.338 --> 00:41:50.549
Do you have any idea what this might be?

647
00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:54.136
It is a photograph album, ma'am.

648
00:41:54.302 --> 00:41:56.304
No, but look. They're all asleep.

649
00:41:56.471 --> 00:41:57.431
Look.

650
00:41:58.181 --> 00:42:00.600
They're not asleep, ma'am. They're dead.

651
00:42:02.894 --> 00:42:04.354
It is a book of the dead.

652
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:08.108
In the last century, I believe,
they used to take photographs of the dead

653
00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:12.946
in the hopes that their souls
would go on living through the portraits.

654
00:42:15.782 --> 00:42:17.617
[Grace] There are even group portraits.

655
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.954
- [gasps] And children.
- Ah.

656
00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:23.331
Oh, it's macabre.

657
00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:28.170
How could these people
be so superstitious?

658
00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:30.797
Grief over the death of a loved one

659
00:42:30.964 --> 00:42:34.760
can lead people
to do the strangest things.

660
00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:41.099
[Grace] Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

661
00:42:41.266 --> 00:42:42.392
[Mrs. Mills] Yes, ma'am.

662
00:42:55.363 --> 00:42:57.991
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.
Why don't you come and sit by the fire?

663
00:43:10.837 --> 00:43:12.422
Thank you very much, ma'am.

664
00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:16.802
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

665
00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:19.930
Did you have to
look after children then as well?

666
00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:23.934
No, I was in charge
of organizing the housework.

667
00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:26.478
Mmm. Were there many servants?

668
00:43:27.312 --> 00:43:29.564
Oh, about 15. [Chuckles]

669
00:43:31.024 --> 00:43:33.777
Though in the end,
there were just the three of us left.

670
00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:34.861
Why?

671
00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:37.656
My employers moved to London.

672
00:43:38.406 --> 00:43:43.954
They came here less and less,
it being so out of the way like.

673
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:48.375
So gradually the house just became empty.

674
00:43:49.709 --> 00:43:52.170
Everybody ends up
leaving this damned island.

675
00:43:54.172 --> 00:43:58.385
My family left in the summer of 1940,
just before the invasion.

676
00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:02.347
That was the last I've heard of them.

677
00:44:04.432 --> 00:44:05.433
Oh.

678
00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:08.311
I don't blame them.

679
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.315
Actually, we left too.

680
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:16.820
Although, you know,
sometimes when you leave a place,

681
00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:21.783
it's like it's there with you
all the time.

682
00:44:22.367 --> 00:44:25.412
I always felt
like I never left this house.

683
00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:26.580
Why did you leave?

684
00:44:27.914 --> 00:44:30.167
Oh, it was on account of the tuberculosis.

685
00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:32.169
The whole area was evacuated.

686
00:44:33.795 --> 00:44:34.880
Oh.

687
00:44:36.089 --> 00:44:38.216
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

688
00:44:38.967 --> 00:44:40.760
Yes, I think so.

689
00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:45.223
Though, you know, my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

690
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:46.808
What happened to her?

691
00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:54.482
Well, suddenly one day,

692
00:44:55.275 --> 00:44:59.196
she just... stopped talking.

693
00:44:59.362 --> 00:45:01.531
But there must have been a reason.

694
00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.743
People don't just stop talking.

695
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:08.622
These things are always the result
of some sort of trauma.

696
00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:11.666
Something must have happened to her.

697
00:45:15.921 --> 00:45:17.589
Did your employers treat you well?

698
00:45:17.756 --> 00:45:20.300
Oh, they were always very kind to us.

699
00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:22.677
They treated us just like family.

700
00:45:25.096 --> 00:45:28.350
You know, ma'am, I think I will go to bed.

701
00:45:28.516 --> 00:45:31.061
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

702
00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:32.771
Off you go.

703
00:45:32.938 --> 00:45:34.648
I'm going to stay here a while longer.

704
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.524
Yes, ma'am.

705
00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.390
[sighs softly]

706
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.019
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

707
00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.487
Can you forgive me?

708
00:46:28.702 --> 00:46:29.703
Anne?

709
00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:51.516
- [Nicholas] Mummy.
- What?

710
00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:53.977
When's Daddy coming home?

711
00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.896
When the war's over.

712
00:46:57.856 --> 00:46:59.649
Why did he go to war?

713
00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:03.028
I mean, nobody's done anything bad to us.

714
00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:05.947
Daddy went <i>-.</i>

715
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:11.578
Daddy went because he's very brave...

716
00:47:13.455 --> 00:47:15.332
and because he wasn't prepared

717
00:47:15.498 --> 00:47:17.876
to let the Germans tell him
what he had to do.

718
00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.378
[Nicholas] Why?

719
00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:28.553
[sobbing]

720
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.763
[whispers] Charles...

721
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.600
where are you?

722
00:47:35.143 --> 00:47:38.772
[piano playing, faint]

723
00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:51.659
[piano continues playing]

724
00:48:15.475 --> 00:48:18.478
[piano continues playing]

725
00:48:38.748 --> 00:48:41.584
[breath trembling]

726
00:48:43.962 --> 00:48:45.964
[playing stops]

727
00:49:05.483 --> 00:49:07.318
[hinge creaks]

728
00:49:12.574 --> 00:49:13.575
[gasps]

729
00:49:21.666 --> 00:49:22.876
[lock clicks]

730
00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:43.146
[hinge creaks]

731
00:50:01.664 --> 00:50:04.667
[creaking continues]

732
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:13.593
[gasps]

733
00:50:14.385 --> 00:50:15.637
[groans]

734
00:50:16.304 --> 00:50:18.181
[rattling]

735
00:50:21.809 --> 00:50:23.144
Mrs. Mills!

736
00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:26.314
Mrs. Mills!

737
00:50:27.815 --> 00:50:29.442
What's the matter, ma'am?

738
00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:32.529
The key to the music room,
give it to me! Quickly!

739
00:50:32.695 --> 00:50:34.614
- What's happening, ma'am?
- Come on!

740
00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:45.583
Oh, my God.

741
00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:47.961
[gasps]

742
00:50:49.587 --> 00:50:51.422
I checked that room myself.

743
00:50:54.008 --> 00:50:55.260
It was empty.

744
00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:57.804
Take these tablets, ma'am.

745
00:50:57.971 --> 00:50:59.430
-And yet -
-They'll do you good.

746
00:50:59.597 --> 00:51:02.141
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

747
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:06.271
And it wasn't human.

748
00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:10.149
There is something in this house.

749
00:51:11.192 --> 00:51:12.944
Something diabolic.

750
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:16.072
- Ma'am...
- Something which is not...

751
00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.743
not at rest.

752
00:51:22.745 --> 00:51:23.871
[sighs]

753
00:51:25.373 --> 00:51:26.791
I know you don't believe it.

754
00:51:28.042 --> 00:51:29.502
You don't believe it, do you?

755
00:51:30.503 --> 00:51:31.713
I don't blame you.

756
00:51:32.338 --> 00:51:35.341
<i>I -</i> I used to not believe these things.
[sniffles]

757
00:51:36.217 --> 00:51:37.260
[sighs]

758
00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.095
I do believe it, ma'am.

759
00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.851
I've always believed in those things.

760
00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:49.814
Oh, they're not easy to explain,
but they do happen.

761
00:51:49.981 --> 00:51:54.319
We've all heard stories of... the beyond,

762
00:51:54.485 --> 00:51:56.237
now and then.

763
00:51:57.655 --> 00:52:01.618
And I think that sometimes, the world...

764
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.747
of the dead gets mixed up

765
00:52:06.664 --> 00:52:08.666
with the world of the living.

766
00:52:10.084 --> 00:52:11.628
But it's impossible.

767
00:52:11.794 --> 00:52:13.963
The Lord would never allow
such an aberration.

768
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:17.342
The living and the dead, they will
only meet at the end of eternity.

769
00:52:20.511 --> 00:52:22.055
It says so in the Bible.

770
00:52:22.221 --> 00:52:23.348
Ma'am...

771
00:52:24.974 --> 00:52:27.977
there isn't always an answer
for everything.

772
00:52:33.191 --> 00:52:34.275
[gasps]

773
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:37.195
[door opens]

774
00:52:40.823 --> 00:52:42.742
[Mrs. Mills] Where are you off to, ma'am?

775
00:52:42.909 --> 00:52:45.328
I'm going to the village
to pay Father McGraw a visit.

776
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.413
If he won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

777
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.665
I shall bring him back.

778
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:50.708
Ma'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

779
00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:52.752
- I've waited long enough.
- [door opens]

780
00:52:53.586 --> 00:52:55.380
Ma'am, the priest told me that -

781
00:52:55.546 --> 00:52:57.215
I don't care what he told you!

782
00:52:57.382 --> 00:52:59.676
I want him to tell me personally.

783
00:52:59.842 --> 00:53:01.135
He must come today.

784
00:53:01.302 --> 00:53:02.887
But what are you going to tell him?

785
00:53:03.054 --> 00:53:06.057
That we have searched
every room in there inch by inch,

786
00:53:06.224 --> 00:53:07.975
and now I need them to be blessed.

787
00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:13.147
Ma'am, please, wait.
Still, it's very early.

788
00:53:13.314 --> 00:53:15.983
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Morning, ma'am.

789
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:18.569
I need you to search
the whole garden for gravestones.

790
00:53:18.736 --> 00:53:19.737
Gravestones?

791
00:53:19.904 --> 00:53:23.116
Yes. When my husband bought this house,
we were told there was a little cemetery.

792
00:53:23.282 --> 00:53:25.702
I think it was somewhere over there,
amongst the trees.

793
00:53:25.868 --> 00:53:26.994
I've not seen anything.

794
00:53:27.161 --> 00:53:28.496
Check carefully.

795
00:53:28.663 --> 00:53:30.873
- It could be overgrown.
- Yes, ma'am.

796
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.710
I need to know
if there was a family buried here

797
00:53:33.876 --> 00:53:35.878
and if they had a little boy, Victor.

798
00:53:52.103 --> 00:53:54.147
Now she thinks the house is haunted.

799
00:53:55.481 --> 00:53:58.109
Do you think it's safe to let her go?

800
00:53:58.276 --> 00:54:00.945
Oh, don't worry.
The fog won't let her get very far.

801
00:54:01.112 --> 00:54:02.655
Oh, yes, the fog.

802
00:54:02.822 --> 00:54:04.574
The fog, of course.

803
00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:09.829
And when - when do you think we should
bring all this out into the open?

804
00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:14.333
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.
All in good time.

805
00:54:15.334 --> 00:54:16.669
Speaking of which...

806
00:54:17.712 --> 00:54:18.713
Oh!

807
00:55:20.608 --> 00:55:22.276
- [twig snaps]
- [gasps]

808
00:55:23.528 --> 00:55:26.572
[panting]

809
00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.741
Wha -

810
00:55:42.046 --> 00:55:45.049
[footsteps approaching]

811
00:55:53.766 --> 00:55:55.852
[footsteps continue]

812
00:56:07.238 --> 00:56:08.573
[gasps]

813
00:56:11.409 --> 00:56:12.410
Charles?

814
00:56:14.078 --> 00:56:15.079
Grace?

815
00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:18.875
Oh.

816
00:56:20.334 --> 00:56:21.335
Oh!

817
00:56:22.837 --> 00:56:23.838
Oh!

818
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.679
[Grace] You're here. You're here.

819
00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:34.724
They - They said there was no hope.

820
00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:37.977
They said I should give you up for dead.

821
00:56:38.644 --> 00:56:40.062
They say a lot of things.

822
00:56:41.188 --> 00:56:42.315
Oh.

823
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:44.275
Oh!

824
00:56:45.651 --> 00:56:46.903
Oh, thank you.

825
00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.405
Thank you, God.

826
00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:50.948
Thank you, God.

827
00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:53.367
Every night I prayed for this,

828
00:56:54.452 --> 00:56:56.287
begging God to bring you back.

829
00:56:58.539 --> 00:57:01.959
Bring the children their father back.
Bring him...

830
00:57:05.087 --> 00:57:07.298
But where have you been all this time?

831
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:11.928
Out there, looking for my home.

832
00:57:20.061 --> 00:57:21.604
You're so different.

833
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:24.440
80 different.

834
00:57:25.232 --> 00:57:26.984
Sometimes I bleed.

835
00:57:35.743 --> 00:57:37.078
[laughs]

836
00:58:02.061 --> 00:58:03.270
[door closes]

837
00:58:05.106 --> 00:58:06.148
Ma'am...

838
00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:09.944
Mrs. Mills...

839
00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:14.240
this is my husband.

840
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.413
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

841
00:58:20.579 --> 00:58:21.914
He's very weak.

842
00:58:22.623 --> 00:58:23.624
Here.

843
00:58:26.419 --> 00:58:29.046
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

844
00:58:30.297 --> 00:58:32.800
- And something to eat.
- Right away, ma'am.

845
00:58:52.778 --> 00:58:54.155
How are my little ones?

846
00:58:57.283 --> 00:58:58.367
Daddy!

847
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:03.247
- [kisses]
- Why did you take so long?

848
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:08.711
[chuckles]

849
00:59:10.379 --> 00:59:11.922
Hello, Nicholas.

850
00:59:12.089 --> 00:59:14.925
I told you. You see?
I told you he'd come back.

851
00:59:19.513 --> 00:59:20.639
[kisses]

852
00:59:22.099 --> 00:59:24.185
Have you both been well behaved?

853
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:25.478
We've been very good.

854
00:59:25.644 --> 00:59:28.314
- Have you been good to your mother?
- [Anne] Very good.

855
00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:30.524
We study every day
for our first communion.

856
00:59:31.984 --> 00:59:33.611
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

857
00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:42.328
- [door opens]
- Oh! Here he comes!

858
00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:49.251
Darling, we've prepared lunch for you.

859
00:59:50.127 --> 00:59:52.546
-Are you coming down or would you prefer -
-[door closes]

860
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.185
[Anne] <i>When is Daddy coming down?</i>

861
01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:10.272
[Grace] <i>Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.</i>

862
01:00:10.439 --> 01:00:12.650
He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.

863
01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:13.734
Shh.

864
01:00:17.738 --> 01:00:21.158
Mummy, when people die in the war,
where do they go?

865
01:00:21.325 --> 01:00:22.910
Oh, what a question. Mmm.

866
01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.872
- It depends.
- On what?

867
01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:31.127
Well, on whether they fought on the side
of the goodies or the baddies.

868
01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:33.379
Your father, for example,
fought for England,

869
01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:34.880
on the side of the goodies.

870
01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:39.927
How do you know who the goodies
and the baddies are?

871
01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:42.847
[scoffs] That's enough questions.
Eat your food.

872
01:00:43.013 --> 01:00:44.515
You'll never go to war.

873
01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:46.517
We'll never go anywhere.

874
01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:47.726
Oh.

875
01:00:49.478 --> 01:00:51.313
Oh, you're not missing out on anything.

876
01:00:52.189 --> 01:00:54.441
You're much better off at home
with your mummy and your daddy

who love you very, very much.

878
01:00:58.571 --> 01:00:59.738
And the intruders.

879
01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.284
There are no intruders here.

880
01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:06.162
But you said that there were.

881
01:01:06.328 --> 01:01:07.830
No, I said
that there are no intruders here.

882
01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.748
I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

883
01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:12.251
-But you said -
-No, that is enough!

884
01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:15.129
- Can I say something?
- No!

885
01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:18.465
- Why not?
- Because - Because you can't!

01:01:29.393 --> 01:01:30.728
You heard me. Stop it.

Right, you go to your room.

01:01:40.362 --> 01:01:42.573
Go to your room.
There's no dessert for you today.

Oh, no crying now, no crying.

Oh, stop that. Here.

899
01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:57.630
Oh, look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

900
01:01:57.796 --> 01:02:01.467
- I don't care!
- There, there.

901
01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:03.093
You listen to me.

902
01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:07.223
I've seen them too.

903
01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:09.516
You have?

904
01:02:10.434 --> 01:02:12.061
Yes.

905
01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:15.105
Then why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

906
01:02:15.272 --> 01:02:17.858
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

907
01:02:18.692 --> 01:02:21.070
She only believes in what she was taught.

908
01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:22.363
But don't worry.

909
01:02:23.447 --> 01:02:25.074
Sooner or later...

910
01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.327
she'll see them.

911
01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:30.746
Then everything will be different.

912
01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.039
How?

913
01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:35.125
Oh, you'll see.

914
01:02:35.834 --> 01:02:38.796
There are going to be some big surprises.

915
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.467
There are going to be... changes.

916
01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.719
Changes?

917
01:02:57.773 --> 01:03:01.110
Now she's behaving
as if nothing had happened.

918
01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:04.571
What about her daughter?

919
01:03:04.738 --> 01:03:06.657
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

920
01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:09.034
The children will be easier to convince.

921
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.205
No, it's the mother who's going
to cause us problems.

922
01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:18.127
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

923
01:03:19.586 --> 01:03:21.255
No.

924
01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:23.799
I don't think he even knows where he is.

925
01:03:38.522 --> 01:03:42.026
Oh, look what a pretty daughter I've got.

926
01:03:44.653 --> 01:03:47.489
Mummy made this veil especially for you.

927
01:03:48.782 --> 01:03:50.993
- Hmm?
- I look like a bride.

928
01:03:52.911 --> 01:03:55.456
Yes. You do.

929
01:03:59.668 --> 01:04:02.504
[sighs] I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

930
01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:05.382
- You can take it off now.
- No.

931
01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:07.384
This dress has to be spotless
for your first communion.

932
01:04:07.551 --> 01:04:09.386
I promise I won't dirty it.

933
01:04:09.553 --> 01:04:12.264
Just let me wear it for a little longer.
Just a little.

934
01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:13.682
On, just a little?

935
01:04:15.476 --> 01:04:16.685
All right.

936
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:19.646
I'll be back shortly.

no leaning against the walls.

that I couldn't leave the house.

No. The war's over.

The war is not over.

You're not going. Do you hear me?

You left us once already. You can't go!

Why?

1051
01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.346
Why did you have to go to that stupid war
that had nothing to do with us?

1052
01:13:14.806 --> 01:13:17.309
Why couldn't you have stayed here
like the others did?

1053
01:13:17.475 --> 01:13:19.728
- The others surrendered.
- We all surrendered!

1054
01:13:20.687 --> 01:13:22.272
The whole island was occupied!

1055
01:13:22.439 --> 01:13:26.192
What - What did you expect? [Sobbing]

1056
01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:28.820
[sighs]

1057
01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:34.075
What were you trying to prove
by going to war?

1058
01:13:34.242 --> 01:13:36.369
Your place was here with us.

1059
01:13:38.496 --> 01:13:39.915
With your family.

1060
01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:44.502
[sighs]

1061
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.380
I loved you.

1062
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.092
That was enough for me.

1063
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:55.388
Living in this darkness...

1064
01:13:57.098 --> 01:13:58.433
in this prison.

1065
01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:03.438
But not for you.

1066
01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:07.317
I wasn't enough for you.

1067
01:14:07.484 --> 01:14:08.485
[crying]

1068
01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:10.195
That's why you left.

1069
01:14:13.406 --> 01:14:15.033
It wasn't just the war.

1070
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:20.622
You want to leave me, don't you?

1071
01:14:32.092 --> 01:14:33.218
[gasps]

1072
01:15:11.339 --> 01:15:13.466
[Charles whispers] Forgive me, Grace.

1073
01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:23.727
[gasps]

1074
01:16:21.534 --> 01:16:22.869
[screaming]

1075
01:16:27.832 --> 01:16:28.917
Anne!

1076
01:16:30.543 --> 01:16:31.753
Nicholas!

1077
01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.549
[Anne, Nicholas screaming]

1078
01:16:39.219 --> 01:16:41.763
[screaming]

1079
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:43.473
What is it? What <i>-.</i>

1080
01:16:44.432 --> 01:16:45.433
Oh!

1081
01:16:46.017 --> 01:16:48.436
- Oh!
- [screaming continues]

1082
01:16:49.813 --> 01:16:50.980
Oh, my God!

1083
01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.441
Here! Oh, my God!

1084
01:16:56.444 --> 01:16:57.445
No!

1085
01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.201
Here!

1086
01:17:06.871 --> 01:17:07.872
Oh!

1087
01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:15.964
Where are the curtains?

1088
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:19.092
[Anne, Nicholas screaming]

1089
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:22.762
[Grace] Mrs. Mills!

1090
01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:40.780
Let me see. Let me see.

1091
01:17:41.364 --> 01:17:44.075
Oh, you're all right. You're all right.

1092
01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:46.995
I want my daddy! [Crying]

1093
01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:52.917
Daddy's gone.

1094
01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:54.752
It's not true!

1095
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.130
Yes, it is.

1096
01:17:58.506 --> 01:17:59.716
It is true.

1097
01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:02.302
[sobbing]

1098
01:18:02.468 --> 01:18:03.887
I love you, Mummy.

1099
01:18:04.637 --> 01:18:05.638
[chuckles]

1100
01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:14.522
Find the curtains.

1101
01:18:17.358 --> 01:18:18.568
Who was it?

1102
01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:20.778
Who did this?

1103
01:18:20.945 --> 01:18:22.071
Tell me!

1104
01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:24.115
Tell me!

1105
01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:25.867
[stammering]

1106
01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:27.452
You know what's happening here!

1107
01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:29.829
You know because it happened to you too!

1108
01:18:29.996 --> 01:18:31.122
You tell me.

1109
01:18:31.789 --> 01:18:33.082
You write it down.

1110
01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:36.294
Write it down! Please!

1111
01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:39.047
[Mrs. Mills] That attitude
won't solve anything, ma'am.

1112
01:18:40.757 --> 01:18:42.383
Anyway, she can't write.

1113
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:44.135
- [Grace] Where are they?
- What?

1114
01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:45.595
The curtains!

1115
01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.556
The curtains
my children's lives depend on!

1116
01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:50.016
Someone has taken the curtains!

1117
01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:51.559
I have noticed, ma'am.

1118
01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.853
There's no need for you
to raise your voice.

1119
01:18:54.979 --> 01:18:58.775
Oh, Mr. Tuttle. I was just
on the point of calling you.

1120
01:18:58.942 --> 01:19:01.903
Did you know that someone
has taken all the curtains?

1121
01:19:03.404 --> 01:19:04.614
The curtains?

1122
01:19:05.949 --> 01:19:07.158
Oh, dear.

1123
01:19:08.409 --> 01:19:11.371
Why should anyone
want to take all the curtains?

1124
01:19:12.705 --> 01:19:16.167
Oh, to let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

1125
01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:18.586
Daylight. Of course.

1126
01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:21.464
Someone wants to kill my children.

1127
01:19:21.631 --> 01:19:23.883
Why do you think
that the daylight would kill them?

1128
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:26.761
Are you mad?

1129
01:19:28.179 --> 01:19:29.389
I told you.

1130
01:19:30.598 --> 01:19:31.849
I already told you!

1131
01:19:32.016 --> 01:19:35.144
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1132
01:19:35.311 --> 01:19:37.563
Yes, but that was before.

1133
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:40.566
The condition could have cleared up
by itself.

1134
01:19:40.733 --> 01:19:43.278
I mean, if you never
expose them to daylight,

1135
01:19:43.444 --> 01:19:45.029
how do you know they're not cured?

1136
01:19:45.863 --> 01:19:49.993
My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheumatism

1137
01:19:50.159 --> 01:19:51.661
in her legs and back.

1138
01:19:53.079 --> 01:19:54.497
Then one fine day...

1139
01:19:56.624 --> 01:19:58.293
they disappeared.

1140
01:20:00.086 --> 01:20:01.796
I am going to find those curtains,

1141
01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.756
and when you have finished
helping me hang them,

1142
01:20:03.923 --> 01:20:05.925
you will leave this house!

1143
01:20:19.355 --> 01:20:21.524
- And what about the master, ma'am?
- [gasps]

1144
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:23.943
What has he got to say about all of this?

1145
01:20:24.861 --> 01:20:26.279
Give me your keys.

1146
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:28.448
I want your keys now!

1147
01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:34.495
I know what you want.

1148
01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:37.123
You want to frighten us.

1149
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:38.541
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

1150
01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:42.003
You've wanted to take over this house
ever since the first day you arrived.

1151
01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:46.257
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

1152
01:20:46.424 --> 01:20:48.009
You should try and calm down, ma'am.

1153
01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:51.137
Give me the keys!

1154
01:20:52.597 --> 01:20:53.890
Give them to me.

1155
01:21:00.646 --> 01:21:02.065
And now get out of here.

1156
01:21:17.705 --> 01:21:18.706
[door closes]

1157
01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:22.085
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

1158
01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:26.047
I think I've reached the end of my tether.

1159
01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:27.423
What about you?

1160
01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:31.636
Oh, yes. Definitely.

1161
01:21:33.554 --> 01:21:36.265
We'd better go and uncover
the gravestones.

1162
01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:12.927
[door locks clicking]

1163
01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:14.220
[door slams]

1164
01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.348
What's Mummy doing?

1165
01:22:17.515 --> 01:22:19.851
I've already told you. She's gone mad.

1166
01:22:20.017 --> 01:22:21.477
- Liar.
- She's gone mad!

1167
01:22:21.644 --> 01:22:22.728
Liar, liar!

1168
01:22:22.895 --> 01:22:24.605
- She's gone mad! She's gone mad!
- Liar, liar!

1169
01:22:24.772 --> 01:22:25.898
Liar!

1170
01:22:31.487 --> 01:22:32.738
Nighttime.

1171
01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:35.783
Where are you going?

1172
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.285
[Anne] I've had enough.

1173
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:41.164
I'm going to the woods to look for Daddy.

1174
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:43.458
Are you going to run away?

1175
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.671
If I hang on to the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

1176
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.631
It's very easy.

1177
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:07.273
If Mummy finds out, you're in for it.

1178
01:23:08.024 --> 01:23:09.859
[Anne] Yes, yes, yes.

1179
01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.578
[Nicholas] Anne, wait!

1180
01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:23.539
I want to come and look for Daddy too.

1181
01:23:23.706 --> 01:23:27.084
Liar. You just don't want
to be left on your own.

1182
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:28.503
Scaredy pants, scaredy pants!

1183
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:29.795
Be quiet!

1184
01:23:59.659 --> 01:24:01.077
[objects clattering]

1185
01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:26.018
Anne, I think we've gotten lost.

1186
01:24:26.185 --> 01:24:28.104
We still haven't
left the garden yet, silly.

1187
01:24:29.355 --> 01:24:32.358
- I'm scared.
- You shouldn't have come, then.

1188
01:24:36.487 --> 01:24:39.657
- [Nicholas] Say something.
- What shall I say?

1189
01:24:39.824 --> 01:24:42.076
I don't know. Anything.

1190
01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:44.787
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I'm walking.

1191
01:24:44.954 --> 01:24:47.123
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

1192
01:25:14.317 --> 01:25:15.735
What's that over there?

1193
01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:19.905
I think they're graves.

1194
01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.075
Don't go near!

1195
01:25:23.242 --> 01:25:24.368
Why not?

1196
01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:26.787
What if a ghost jumps out?

1197
01:25:26.954 --> 01:25:29.582
Graves don't have ghosts. Only skeletons.

1198
01:25:35.713 --> 01:25:38.758
[panting]

1199
01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:49.977
- There's something written here.
- [Nicholas] Let's go!

1200
01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.395
Wait!

1201
01:26:02.865 --> 01:26:04.075
[gasps]

1202
01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:12.083
[gasps]

1203
01:26:14.877 --> 01:26:17.505
Anne! What does it say?

1204
01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.884
[gasps]

1205
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.473
[Mrs. Mills]
You must be strong now, children.

1206
01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.974
[Anne] Nicholas, come here!

1207
01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:33.479
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell Mummy
we've run away.

1208
01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:34.772
Don't speak to them!

1209
01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:37.942
- Why?
- They're dead!

1210
01:26:38.651 --> 01:26:41.237
- What?
- They're ghosts! Please come here!

1211
01:26:42.029 --> 01:26:43.030
Children!

1212
01:26:43.739 --> 01:26:44.824
[Anne] Nicholas!

1213
01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:49.995
They're ghosts? Why aren't they
wearing sheets and clanking chains?

1214
01:26:50.162 --> 01:26:51.163
You said that -

1215
01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:53.999
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!

1216
01:26:54.166 --> 01:26:58.087
You're always teasing me
and telling lies, and I'm sick of it!

1217
01:26:58.254 --> 01:27:00.881
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth!

1218
01:27:01.048 --> 01:27:02.174
Come here!

1219
01:27:03.008 --> 01:27:04.427
[gasps]

1220
01:27:04.593 --> 01:27:05.678
Quick!

1221
01:27:06.637 --> 01:27:09.807
[Anne screaming]

1222
01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:11.934
Children!

1223
01:27:14.478 --> 01:27:16.105
[screaming continues]

1224
01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:19.650
[Grace] Run!

1225
01:27:19.817 --> 01:27:21.068
Run!

1226
01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:23.571
Go! Run! Into the house!

1227
01:27:26.615 --> 01:27:28.033
Don't come any closer!

1228
01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:31.746
Don't move! [Panting]

1229
01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:37.877
[Mrs. Mills]
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1230
01:27:38.043 --> 01:27:42.923
Tuberculosis finished us off
more than half a century ago.

1231
01:28:00.816 --> 01:28:01.817
[gasps]

1232
01:28:03.402 --> 01:28:04.612
[Grace] Go away!

1233
01:28:08.407 --> 01:28:10.451
[doorknob rattling]

1234
01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.453
Open the door, ma'am. Please.

1235
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:13.788
What do you want?

1236
01:28:13.954 --> 01:28:16.832
Mummy, don't open the door. Don't.

1237
01:28:16.999 --> 01:28:18.709
We've seen their graves.

1238
01:28:18.876 --> 01:28:20.211
Go upstairs and hide.

1239
01:28:21.128 --> 01:28:22.755
- Go on. Go.
- I'm scared.

1240
01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:23.964
Oh!

1241
01:28:29.386 --> 01:28:30.679
Don't separate.

1242
01:28:30.846 --> 01:28:31.889
[gasps]

1243
01:28:33.557 --> 01:28:34.642
Oh!

1244
01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:40.981
Whatever you do, don't separate. Hmm?

1245
01:28:42.066 --> 01:28:45.069
Go hide. Go. Go.

1246
01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:48.364
[Mrs. Mills] We've been trying
to make you understand.

1247
01:28:51.575 --> 01:28:52.910
Understand what?

1248
01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:54.203
About the house.

1249
01:28:55.037 --> 01:28:56.956
About the new situation.

1250
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:59.416
[Grace] What situation?

1251
01:29:00.167 --> 01:29:04.964
We must all learn to live together,
the living and the dead.

1252
01:29:05.130 --> 01:29:06.215
[gasps]

1253
01:29:07.049 --> 01:29:10.052
If you're dead, leave us in peace.

1254
01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:13.222
Leave us in peace!

1255
01:29:14.139 --> 01:29:16.350
Leave us in peace!

1256
01:29:21.772 --> 01:29:23.607
In here. Get inside.

1257
01:29:29.822 --> 01:29:31.991
[Mrs. Mills] And suppose we do leave you.

1258
01:29:32.157 --> 01:29:35.286
- Do you think they will?
- Who?

1259
01:29:35.452 --> 01:29:36.954
The intruders.

1260
01:29:38.205 --> 01:29:39.290
There are no intruders.

1261
01:29:39.456 --> 01:29:41.458
- [Mr. Tuttle] They took the curtains down.
- There are no intruders.

1262
01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:44.128
[Mr. Tuttle] Oh, yes.
I assure you it was them.

1263
01:29:45.254 --> 01:29:49.425
And now they're in there
with you and the children.

1264
01:29:49.592 --> 01:29:50.634
Waiting for you.

1265
01:29:50.801 --> 01:29:52.344
- No!
- [Mrs. Mills] Yes.

1266
01:29:53.053 --> 01:29:57.975
And believe me, sooner or later,
they'll find you.

1267
01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:00.352
Listen, wait here,
and I'll be back in a minute.

1268
01:30:00.519 --> 01:30:03.606
No, no, no.
Mummy said we shouldn't separate.

1269
01:30:03.772 --> 01:30:05.608
I can't leave her on her own.

1270
01:30:07.234 --> 01:30:09.862
[breathing heavily]

1271
01:30:10.529 --> 01:30:12.031
Stop breathing like that.

1272
01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:19.163
[Nicholas continues breathing heavily]

1273
01:30:20.164 --> 01:30:22.625
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.

1274
01:30:25.544 --> 01:30:26.754
Stop breathing!

1275
01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:32.551
Can't you hear it? There's someone there.

1276
01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:38.974
- [old lady] Come with us, children.
- [both gasp]

1277
01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.560
Come with us.

1278
01:30:42.394 --> 01:30:43.604
[screaming]

1279
01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:44.772
[gasps]

1280
01:30:49.026 --> 01:30:50.152
Nicholas?

1281
01:30:52.821 --> 01:30:53.948
Anne?

1282
01:30:56.825 --> 01:30:58.035
Where are you?

1283
01:31:01.538 --> 01:31:03.165
Answer me!

1284
01:31:03.332 --> 01:31:04.833
The intruders have found them.

1285
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.919
There's nothing we can do now.

1286
01:31:07.836 --> 01:31:11.632
You'll have to go upstairs
and talk to them.

1287
01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:32.277
[Grace] Our Father, who art in heaven,

1288
01:31:33.278 --> 01:31:34.697
hallowed be thy name.

1289
01:31:35.406 --> 01:31:37.074
Thy kingdom come,

1290
01:31:37.241 --> 01:31:40.577
Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven.

1291
01:31:42.287 --> 01:31:44.456
Give us this day our daily bread,

1292
01:31:44.623 --> 01:31:46.250
and forgive us our trespasses...

1293
01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:48.961
[Nicholas whimpering]

1294
01:31:49.128 --> 01:31:51.505
[old lady] Why are you afraid, children?

1295
01:31:52.464 --> 01:31:55.634
Why don't you want us to be your friends?

1296
01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:57.761
Come, come.

1297
01:31:57.928 --> 01:32:00.305
Come on. Speak to us.

1298
01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:02.641
Speak.

1299
01:32:07.354 --> 01:32:10.983
Tell me what happened.

1300
01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:12.651
[Nicholas whimpers]

1301
01:32:12.818 --> 01:32:15.404
[Nicholas] Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

1302
01:32:15.988 --> 01:32:18.490
[assistant] "Don't tell her."

1303
01:32:19.783 --> 01:32:22.494
If I tell her, they'll leave us in peace.

1304
01:32:25.289 --> 01:32:26.498
[Nicholas] Mummy!

1305
01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:29.334
"Mummy."

1306
01:32:30.002 --> 01:32:32.212
Why are you crying, children?

1307
01:32:33.797 --> 01:32:35.799
What happened in this room?

1308
01:32:37.217 --> 01:32:39.887
What did your mother do to you?

1309
01:32:42.765 --> 01:32:46.435
[whispering]

1310
01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:54.276
Something about a pillow.

1311
01:32:54.985 --> 01:32:57.279
Is that how she killed you?

1312
01:32:57.988 --> 01:32:59.156
[rosary clatters]

1313
01:32:59.323 --> 01:33:00.783
With a pillow?

1314
01:33:00.949 --> 01:33:02.159
She didn't kill us!

1315
01:33:02.326 --> 01:33:03.744
[old lady] Children, if you're dead,

1316
01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:06.663
why do you remain in this house?

1317
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:08.415
[Anne] We're not dead!

1318
01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:09.541
[sobs]

1319
01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:11.585
[old lady] Why do you remain
in this house?

1320
01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:13.170
We're not dead!

1321
01:33:13.337 --> 01:33:15.714
- [Nicholas] We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1322
01:33:15.881 --> 01:33:17.091
We're not dead!

1323
01:33:17.257 --> 01:33:20.219
[old lady] Why do you remain
in this house?

1324
01:33:20.385 --> 01:33:23.013
- [Nicholas] We're not dead!
- "We are not dead. We are not dead."

1325
01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.140
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1326
01:33:25.307 --> 01:33:28.560
We're not dead! We're not dead!

1327
01:33:29.645 --> 01:33:31.480
We're not dead! We're not...

1328
01:33:32.648 --> 01:33:33.732
dead!

1329
01:33:34.525 --> 01:33:35.609
Oh!

1330
01:33:36.318 --> 01:33:37.319
[gasps]

1331
01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:46.537
[exhales]

1332
01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.665
[husband] Are you all right?

1333
01:33:49.832 --> 01:33:53.377
Yes. Just a bit dizzy, that's all.

1334
01:33:55.379 --> 01:33:56.588
What happened?

1335
01:33:57.673 --> 01:34:00.092
They made contact.

1336
01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:04.221
- All three?
- Apparently, yes.

1337
01:34:05.347 --> 01:34:07.015
The mother and the two children.

1338
01:34:09.059 --> 01:34:10.978
Quite interesting, don't you think?

1339
01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:14.481
Interesting? I was scared out of my wits!

1340
01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.525
- Darling, calm down.
- No.

1341
01:34:16.692 --> 01:34:19.027
So far, we have handled
this matter your way.

1342
01:34:19.194 --> 01:34:20.863
But now you listen to me.

1343
01:34:21.029 --> 01:34:23.407
We can't possibly
stay in this house any longer.

1344
01:34:23.574 --> 01:34:26.493
It is quite clear that these beings
do not want us to live here.

1345
01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:29.037
- We don't know anything about them yet.
- Yes, we do!

1346
01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:31.915
We know the woman went mad,

1347
01:34:32.082 --> 01:34:34.501
smothered her two children,
and then shot herself.

1348
01:34:35.210 --> 01:34:36.587
That's quite enough.

1349
01:34:36.753 --> 01:34:38.088
Think of our son.

1350
01:34:38.255 --> 01:34:39.673
There's nothing wrong with Victor.

1351
01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.425
Yes, there is.

1352
01:34:41.592 --> 01:34:44.469
He has nightmares.
He says he has seen that girl.

1353
01:34:44.636 --> 01:34:47.514
And even this lady
has been possessed by her.

1354
01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:49.892
Please, let us leave this house.

1355
01:34:50.058 --> 01:34:50.976
All right.

1356
01:34:52.311 --> 01:34:54.563
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1357
01:34:55.147 --> 01:34:56.732
Oh, thank God for that.

1358
01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.819
I'll just go and check on Victor.

1359
01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:06.325
[husband]
Once again, thank you so much for coming.

1360
01:35:06.491 --> 01:35:09.161
Pleasure. I hope we've been of some help.

1361
01:35:09.328 --> 01:35:12.956
Oh, yes, of course. Though I must admit,
that was not the most pleasant...

1362
01:35:13.874 --> 01:35:15.918
[assistant chuckles]

1363
01:35:16.084 --> 01:35:18.128
[Grace] At first, I couldn't understand...

1364
01:35:20.464 --> 01:35:22.883
what the pillow was doing in my hands...

1365
01:35:26.011 --> 01:35:27.888
and why you didn't move.

1366
01:35:32.851 --> 01:35:34.102
But then I knew.

1367
01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.107
It had happened.

1368
01:35:43.612 --> 01:35:45.614
I had killed my children.

1369
01:35:52.454 --> 01:35:54.206
I got the rifle.

1370
01:35:56.583 --> 01:35:58.418
I put it to my forehead...

1371
01:36:02.965 --> 01:36:04.800
and I pulled the trigger.

1372
01:36:09.554 --> 01:36:10.639
Nothing.

1373
01:36:18.313 --> 01:36:21.149
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.

1374
01:36:23.026 --> 01:36:24.778
[gasps]

1375
01:36:25.862 --> 01:36:29.408
You were playing with the pillows
as if nothing had happened.

1376
01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.663
And I thought... [inhales]

1377
01:36:35.247 --> 01:36:38.709
...the Lord, in his great mercy,

1378
01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:43.005
was giving me another chance,

1379
01:36:44.589 --> 01:36:48.719
telling me, "Don't give up."

1380
01:36:52.222 --> 01:36:53.432
Be strong.

1381
01:36:55.892 --> 01:36:57.311
Be a good mother...

1382
01:36:59.855 --> 01:37:01.064
"for them."

1383
01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:06.528
But now...

1384
01:37:10.407 --> 01:37:11.491
Now...

1385
01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:17.289
What does all this mean?

1386
01:37:21.835 --> 01:37:23.211
Where are we?

1387
01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:27.466
[Mrs. Mills] Young Lydia
said the very same thing

1388
01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:31.386
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1389
01:37:32.637 --> 01:37:35.766
And that was the last time she ever spoke.

1390
01:37:38.268 --> 01:37:40.812
But I couldn't tell you that before now.

1391
01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:48.445
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1392
01:37:52.699 --> 01:37:56.703
The intruders are leaving,
but others will come.

1393
01:37:57.329 --> 01:37:59.539
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1394
01:37:59.706 --> 01:38:01.833
Other times, we won't.

1395
01:38:03.502 --> 01:38:05.712
But that's the way it's always been.

1396
01:38:08.548 --> 01:38:09.549
Ma'am.

1397
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:15.180
[Nicholas whispers] Mummy.

1398
01:38:16.556 --> 01:38:18.558
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?

1399
01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:20.435
[Grace] Yes.

1400
01:38:20.602 --> 01:38:22.521
[Nicholas] Will we ever see him again?

1401
01:38:23.146 --> 01:38:24.564
I don't know.

1402
01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:29.694
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1403
01:38:34.116 --> 01:38:36.701
I don't know if there even is a limbo.

1404
01:38:39.788 --> 01:38:41.581
I'm no wiser than you are.

1405
01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:47.045
But I do know that I love you.

1406
01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:50.966
I've always loved you.

1407
01:38:54.886 --> 01:38:57.013
And this house is ours.

1408
01:38:58.974 --> 01:39:00.434
You say it with me.

1409
01:39:01.977 --> 01:39:04.521
- This house is ours.
- [Anne] This house is ours.

1410
01:39:04.688 --> 01:39:07.190
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1411
01:39:07.357 --> 01:39:10.152
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1412
01:39:12.863 --> 01:39:14.823
[Grace, echoing] <i>This house</i> is <i>ours.</i>

1413
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:18.618
[Anne, echoing] <i>The house is ours.
The house is ours.</i>

1414
01:39:18.785 --> 01:39:20.454
<i>The house is ours...</i>

1415
01:39:27.627 --> 01:39:31.131
Mummy, look. It doesn't hurt anymore.

1416
01:39:42.267 --> 01:39:44.644
No one can make us leave this house.

1417
01:40:11.546 --> 01:40:12.839
Come along, Victor.

1418
01:40:37.656 --> 01:40:40.534
[chain rattling]

1419
01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:41.618
[lock clicks]

1420
01:40:41.785 --> 01:40:43.703
[seagulls squawking]
