00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:50.700
# Cat out green that
could deal with weez' #

2
00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:53.328
# Homie quick like coupes,
'cause they feel the breeze #

3
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.705
# And I'm Holly Grove's hear,
the hood made me trill #

4
00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.999
# The hottest hot boy,
baby, time reveal #

5
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.543
# And I'm Momma's oldest boy,
Papa's first seed #

6
00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:03.171
# But Papa's not real,
he don't bleed what I bleed #

7
00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:05.382
# I'm nineteen strong,
a kid with a kid #

8
00:01:05.423 --> 00:01:08.051
# And ain't too many people
outdid what I did #

9
00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:10.345
# I rock bricks down,
I rock ever town #

10
00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:12.389
# I puff the best 'Bro,
pound for pound #

11
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.266
# Now say round,
the boy tough not bluff #

12
00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.394
# Yeezy weezy,
young money squad up #

13
00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:19.729
# I do this for
the penitentiar #

14
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:22.565
# I stunt for y'all while
I'm spending these dollars #

15
00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:25.026
# I like cells
like four-corner blocks... #

16
00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:33.326
Knockdown! Knockdown!

17
00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:38.081
Another victory
for Sweetwater!

18
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:44.337
And now, for your
entertainment pleasure...

19
00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.339
while we get ready
for the main event...

20
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:50.760
give it up for the Gat Boyz!

21
00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:55.640
# You in the ghetto #

22
00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.143
# We ain't got
no hustlers here #

23
00:01:58.178 --> 00:01:59.978
# Get down and give me ten #

24
00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:07.485
# I don't know what
you've been told #

25
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.324
# Motheruckin' rock 'n' roll #

26
00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:16.745
# Blame it on the bullshit #

27
00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:19.706
# To the north, to the south
to the east to the west #

28
00:02:19.748 --> 00:02:22.626
I saw Louis the night
that he beat Braddock...

29
00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:25.462
won the title. 1937.

30
00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:27.422
Louis hits him
with a left and a right!

31
00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:28.798
And Braddock is down!

32
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.092
Straight right hand to the jaw.

33
00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:33.470
Christ, they could've
counted to fifty.

34
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.972
He was the best heavyweight...

35
00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:38.099
that ever fought
under the modern rules.

36
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.310
No discussion, the best.

37
00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:44.731
Then the fucking government
chased him about taxes.

38
00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:49.653
Fucking IRS,
fucking bureaucrat assholes.

39
00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:53.490
Fuck it.

40
00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:02.457
# I don't know
what you've been told #

41
00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:06.920
# Motheruckin' rock 'n' roll #

42
00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:11.841
# Blame it on the bullshit #

43
00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:16.846
# To the north, to the south,
to the east, to the west #

44
00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:26.314
# To the north, to the south,
to the east, to the west #

45
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:53.717
in the west corner,
weighing in at 230 pounds...

46
00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:55.969
wearing the green trunks
with the gold trim...

47
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:59.889
he's undefeated with
eight wins and no losses.

48
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:02.392
Representing
the State Prison at Loda...

49
00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:05.562
the great white hope,
Vern Van Zant!

50
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.399
# Let me tell you boys
who you're messing with #

51
00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:10.859
Now in the east corner...

52
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.278
he's also undefeated
and defending champion...

53
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.531
with a record of
67 wins and no losses...

54
00:04:16.573 --> 00:04:19.492
weighing in at 191 pounds...

55
00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:21.578
wearing the burgundy trunks
with the black trim...

56
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.916
Sweetwater's own,
Monroe Hutchen!

57
00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.481
All right now, shit birds,
y'all both know the rules.

58
00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:52.442
I want a nice, clean fight,
nothing below the belt.

59
00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:55.236
You understand me? Let's box.

60
00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:03.119
Now remember,
brother convicts...

61
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:04.496
if you learned how to act...

62
00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.039
they wouldn't have to fight
inside of a cage.

63
00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:07.457
And be on your
best behavior, too...

64
00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:09.250
'cause we don't want
no incidents, all right?

65
00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:10.627
Now, let's see what
the pride of Loda...

66
00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.462
has to offer against
the great Monroe.

67
00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:14.547
Give Hitler's cousin
his lunch, baby.

68
00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.967
It's all you, baby!
It's all you!

69
00:05:17.008 --> 00:05:18.593
Yeah! Come on now!

70
00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.512
Come back
from the rail-get back,

71
00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.685
And there go the bell.
Here we go.

72
00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:29.396
Monroe comes out
and peppers him...

73
00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:31.064
with a nice left hand,

74
00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:32.607
And another left hand,

75
00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:36.569
Monroe's
just feeling him out...

76
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:38.488
popping him with
a little left hand,

77
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.490
He going to shine that
bald head up, for sure,

78
00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:43.576
Move your feet!
Oh, yeah, that's right!

79
00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:45.412
Yeah! Yeah!

80
00:05:45.453 --> 00:05:47.205
Beat the teeth out of
his mouth, Monroe!

81
00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:48.456
Come on, man!

82
00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:56.339
A left
and a right by Monroe!

83
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.883
This guy hasn't
tagged Monroe yet,

84
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.428
How in the hell
could you be 6-6, 280...

85
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.471
and look wobbly already? Ooh!

86
00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:06.016
He's down! He's down!

87
00:06:06.057 --> 00:06:09.144
He's already down!
Vern Van Zant is down!

88
00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:12.230
We're not even halfway
through the first round...

89
00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.773
and he's already down!

90
00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:17.444
Excuse me, sir,
we just got some big news.

91
00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:21.531
The word is, the Iceman's
day of arrival is tomorrow.

92
00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:23.241
E.T.A., 2 p. m.

93
00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.285
Now, Vern Van Zant
said he got those...

94
00:06:25.327 --> 00:06:27.245
brand-new tattoos
just for this occasion.

95
00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:28.455
Well, Vern, don't look like...

96
00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.380
the parry’s gonna last
too long for you.

97
00:06:30.415 --> 00:06:34.669
This guy is a bum-
big, uncoordinated motherfucker.

98
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:36.046
Nine...

99
00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:40.508
Look at me! You OK? Box!

100
00:06:42.093 --> 00:06:44.679
Ah, here we go again!
Monroe's on the hunt.

101
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:46.389
Vern, swinging and a-missing,

102
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:49.059
Ooh! And another left,
right to the midsection,

103
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.727
Left and right
uppercuts to the head!

104
00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:52.687
Right to the head!
Right to the stomach,

105
00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.481
This guy's just
a- swinging and a-missing!

106
00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:56.024
Hits him with
a left and a right!

107
00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:57.984
Monroe's just
tearing his ass up,

108
00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:01.279
Right in the face!
Right to the head!

109
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:03.365
Left to the midsection!
Right to the head!

110
00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:04.866
Another left and a right!

111
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.451
Oh, my God,
he shined his head up!

112
00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:08.453
I told you,
he's shinin' it up!

113
00:07:11.456 --> 00:07:13.458
One more time for Monroe,

114
00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:15.377
Knockout! Knockout!

115
00:07:17.087 --> 00:07:19.047
One round, motherfucker!

116
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.385
That's it! That's it!

117
00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:29.265
It's done! This fight is over!
Monroe wins again!

118
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:32.352
Spit it.

119
00:07:32.394 --> 00:07:34.396
Yeah, but I got a little
announcement for you.

120
00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:35.855
Got a little
announcement for you.

121
00:07:35.897 --> 00:07:37.274
Little news bulletin.

122
00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:39.401
Y'all been wondering
when that day is coming.

123
00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:42.862
Well, that day is tomorrow.
He's coming to Sweetwater.

124
00:07:42.904 --> 00:07:44.406
The so-called undisputed...

125
00:07:44.447 --> 00:07:46.408
heavyweight champion
of the world...

126
00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:50.078
George "Iceman" Chambers!

127
00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:54.040
What do you say to that,
Monroe? You ready?

128
00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:07.679
OK, here we go. Tape rolling.

129
00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:11.433
Former world
heavyweight champion...

130
00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:13.226
George "Iceman" Chambers...

131
00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:14.936
now you'll be moving
to a new home...

132
00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:17.147
going to live with
murderers and thieves...

133
00:08:17.188 --> 00:08:18.857
in California's newly-built...

134
00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.817
Sweetwater Prison
in the Mojave Desert.

135
00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:23.445
How's all this going for you?

136
00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:27.073
I'll be OK.
I got a bad break.

137
00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:29.034
I just gotta
play this thing out.

138
00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:32.245
Your lawyers have filed
all the expected appeals...

139
00:08:32.287 --> 00:08:35.248
but realistically, what do
you think of your chances...

140
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.833
of getting out
before serving...

141
00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:39.377
the full sentence
of 6 to 8 years?

142
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.173
I'm not supposed to talk
about that legal stuff.

143
00:08:43.214 --> 00:08:45.592
My people don't want me
commenting on that.

144
00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:47.594
Boxing experts tend to agree...

145
00:08:47.636 --> 00:08:50.138
that even as little
as two years in a prison...

146
00:08:50.221 --> 00:08:52.599
without proper training
could mean the end...

147
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:54.851
for a boxer your age.
Now, you're regarded...

148
00:08:54.893 --> 00:08:56.478
as one of the greatest
offensive fighters...

149
00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:58.063
in the history of the sport...

150
00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.523
an attacker
like Dempsey, Joe Louis...

151
00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:03.526
Rocky Marciano, Joe Frazier,

152
00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:06.363
Just exactly how
damaging to your skills...

153
00:09:06.404 --> 00:09:08.365
is this prison stint
likely to be?

154
00:09:08.406 --> 00:09:12.118
No damage.
I'll stay in shape, work out...

155
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.037
watch what I eat. I'll be fine.

156
00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:17.040
But when an athlete
is removed from competition-

157
00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:19.960
That's where you're making
one big mistake right off.

158
00:09:20.001 --> 00:09:24.422
I'm not an athlete.
I'm a gladiator.

159
00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.049
How do you define that?

160
00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:30.679
People play baseball.
Nobody plays boxing.

161
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.556
Iceman, last week after
you were convicted...

162
00:09:33.598 --> 00:09:36.685
boxing's various
so-called governing bodies...

163
00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:38.645
began stripping you of
your title belts...

164
00:09:38.687 --> 00:09:40.063
stripping you-

165
00:09:40.105 --> 00:09:41.856
Who they think they kidding?

166
00:09:41.898 --> 00:09:43.775
Everybody knows I'm the champ.

167
00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:45.986
And I'm gonna be the champ
till I quit.

168
00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:09.092
This fight with
Manfredy is meant to be...

169
00:10:09.134 --> 00:10:11.094
just a tune-up for
George "The Iceman" Chambers...

170
00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:12.721
hopefully leading
to the unification bout...

171
00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:14.097
with Montel Briscoe...

172
00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:16.808
undefeated holder
of the WBC crown,

173
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.436
The two biggest names in boxing
on a collision course...

174
00:10:19.477 --> 00:10:21.104
sometime next year...

175
00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:24.274
assuming the Iceman gets by
the South American challenger,

176
00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:32.032
It's round 1 and one to go,
and it's all Iceman!

177
00:10:32.073 --> 00:10:35.243
He's stalking Manfredy,
chasing the big South American,

178
00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:41.625
Iceman with a right,
another right,

179
00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:44.336
Another right
and a left to the body!

180
00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:48.048
Oh, and a right-hand uppercut,
That staggered Manfredy!

181
00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:51.217
Iceman stalking him,
He knows he's got him hurt,

182
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:54.220
Oh, body shots!
Right, left to the body!

183
00:10:54.262 --> 00:10:56.848
Left hook and he's down!
He's down! He's down!

184
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.559
That's why they call him
the Iceman!

185
00:11:01.186 --> 00:11:02.646
Well, Carlos Manfredy...

186
00:11:02.687 --> 00:11:05.440
gets a one-way ticket
back to Brazil!

187
00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:08.860
George "Iceman" Chambers...

188
00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:11.488
remains undefeated
heavyweight champion!

189
00:11:11.529 --> 00:11:13.990
And the big man on the block!

190
00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:22.290
Are you fighting Montel next?

191
00:11:22.374 --> 00:11:24.584
Just another sucker who's
gonna get his ass whipped.

192
00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:27.128
If the money's right,
bring on Montel.

193
00:11:27.212 --> 00:11:29.089
Nobody's running,
nobody's ducking.

194
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.093
Nobody-I mean, nobody-
can stand up to what I got.

195
00:11:33.134 --> 00:11:34.511
Does that include Montel?

196
00:11:34.552 --> 00:11:36.554
Oh, yeah, that damn sure
includes Montel.

197
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.891
Mr. Lewis!

198
00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:42.435
Estimates are up
to 300 million dollars...

199
00:11:42.477 --> 00:11:44.104
for the pay-per-view
gate alone.

200
00:11:44.145 --> 00:11:45.438
Any comment on that?

201
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.107
Let's make the deal first.

202
00:11:47.148 --> 00:11:51.444
But my first guess is
you're a few million short.

203
00:11:51.486 --> 00:11:53.738
And, Iceman,
it's nine months till summer.

204
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.115
What's next for you?

205
00:11:55.156 --> 00:11:56.992
Well, first of all,
I'm gonna go to L.A...

206
00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.493
you know, see some friends...

207
00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.453
then I'm gonna do
a little partying.

208
00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:05.959
Hey, hey... that's it.

209
00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:07.377
I've done things in my life...

210
00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:09.386
maybe I shouldn't have.
I know that.

211
00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:12.549
But I did not want to,
and I told him "No. "

212
00:12:19.264 --> 00:12:22.065
You'll be moving
into a new home...

213
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.394
going to live with
murderers and thieves...

214
00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:25.777
in California's newly-built...

215
00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:27.897
Sweetwater Prison
in the Mojave Desert,

216
00:12:27.932 --> 00:12:29.983
Without getting into
legal strategy...

217
00:12:30.018 --> 00:12:31.401
let's discuss your trial.

218
00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:33.111
You continue to maintain
your innocence.

219
00:12:33.194 --> 00:12:35.071
I didn't rape nobody.

220
00:12:35.113 --> 00:12:37.115
I done a lot of wrong shit
in my life...

221
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.082
but I ain't no punk-ass rapist.

222
00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:41.494
Look at me.
What I gotta rape somebody for?

223
00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:16.905
Psst. Monroe.

224
00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:18.490
You see him through the window?

225
00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:20.575
Big deal's got his own
helicopter service...

226
00:13:20.617 --> 00:13:22.494
instead of coming
in here on the bus.

227
00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.621
He's the champ.

228
00:13:24.663 --> 00:13:27.832
What's this shit?
Don't think negative, man.

229
00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:29.334
I don't want to hear that shit.

230
00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:31.419
This is your house.
You own this place.

231
00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:35.674
If this was my house,
I could get up and leave.

232
00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:46.851
He's here.

233
00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:48.603
Just getting out
of the helicopter.

234
00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:51.439
Maybe you'd like to meet him,
Mr. Ripstein.

235
00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:53.608
I could bring him over.
You two could talk boxing.

236
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.778
I'll tell you when
I want to talk to him.

237
00:14:04.953 --> 00:14:07.831
Why couldn't your high-priced
team of lawyers...

238
00:14:07.872 --> 00:14:09.833
convince a judge and a jury?

239
00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:12.419
Because I put people
in body bags on TV...

240
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.379
and get paid
a lot of money for it.

241
00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:16.881
Because I'm a big, bad,
black motherfucker-

242
00:14:16.923 --> 00:14:18.717
that's why nobody believes me.

243
00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:21.511
I have received
over 170 requests...

244
00:14:21.553 --> 00:14:23.888
for interviews with you,
Mr. Chambers.

245
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.557
Networks, local TV, cable...

246
00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.642
ever newspaper organization
in the country...

247
00:14:27.684 --> 00:14:30.895
foreign press, foreign TV-
you name it,

248
00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:33.106
I have turned them all down,

249
00:14:33.148 --> 00:14:36.651
Mr. Chambers,
here is Sweetwater,

250
00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:38.528
Maximum security, level five...

251
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.322
state correctional
institution...

252
00:14:40.363 --> 00:14:42.824
with nearly
seven hundred prisoners.

253
00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:46.995
We house only murderers,
armed robbers, rapists...

254
00:14:47.037 --> 00:14:48.747
and those with
connections to gangs...

255
00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:50.915
and other forms
of organized crime.

256
00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:54.919
The state is trying to
spare lesser criminals...

257
00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:57.964
the contaminating influence
of these more hardened types.

258
00:14:58.006 --> 00:15:01.468
Now, we don't want
any incidents that might add...

259
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:03.845
to your already great
difficulties, Mr. Chambers,

260
00:15:03.887 --> 00:15:05.889
This is Mr. Mercker.

261
00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:08.433
He's the senior prison officer,
He's the head guard,

262
00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:10.727
This is Ms. Early,
our administrative officer.

263
00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:12.437
She can arrange
for religious counsel...

264
00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:13.730
or instruction, if you wish.

265
00:15:13.772 --> 00:15:18.610
Whatever.
I need a CD player and some CDs.

266
00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:20.153
Now, I'll give you a list.

267
00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:22.280
My people on the outside
will pay for it all.

268
00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:24.115
Not possible
for the first six months.

269
00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:25.575
It's a privilege,
has to be earned.

270
00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:27.077
Any and all privileges...

271
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.663
will depend upon
your general conduct,

272
00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:32.499
Mr. Chambers,
you have been convicted...

273
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.459
and sent here
for the crime of rape.

274
00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:36.127
That's a very serious mater,

275
00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:37.712
If you'd take advantage...

276
00:15:37.754 --> 00:15:39.506
of this opportunity
to apologize...

277
00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:41.716
to this woman
and to sports fans...

278
00:15:41.758 --> 00:15:43.677
and the American public
for letting them down-

279
00:15:43.718 --> 00:15:45.387
heck, even the former
president of the-

280
00:15:45.428 --> 00:15:47.138
Man, fuck the president!

281
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.473
I ain't apologizing-

282
00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:51.226
not to you, not to her,
not to nobody!

283
00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:53.561
And you lucky I got this
damn gate between you and me...

284
00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:56.606
or I’d rip you a new asshole,
you judgmental motherfucker!

285
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:00.527
Another strong
athlete in the joint!

286
00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:03.113
Welcome to Sweetwater,
Chambers!

287
00:16:05.448 --> 00:16:07.117
If you
need anything, champ...

288
00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:08.451
I got you covered,

289
00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:20.422
Hey, champ!
Seen all your fights, man!

290
00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:30.849
You got a name?

291
00:16:32.142 --> 00:16:34.853
Mingo.

292
00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:39.608
Mingo, move your shit,
stay out of my way...

293
00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:42.485
and we'll get along just fine.

294
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:51.328
Hey, listen. It's an honor
to be cellmates with you.

295
00:16:51.369 --> 00:16:53.455
I don't want no trouble, champ.

296
00:16:53.496 --> 00:16:56.666
No trouble. You just gonna
stay out of my way.

297
00:16:56.708 --> 00:16:58.251
He just thinks he's the king.

298
00:16:58.293 --> 00:17:01.129
Because he's the heavyweight
champ, he's the man.

299
00:17:01.171 --> 00:17:03.381
Well, for some of us others,
we have rights, too...

300
00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:07.177
and I had the right to say no
if I didn't want to.

301
00:17:07.218 --> 00:17:10.680
I want everybody
to keep your distance.

302
00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:13.099
I don't need to make
no new friends...

303
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:15.560
or hear no sad stories
on why they're here.

304
00:17:15.602 --> 00:17:17.896
I got my own sad story for that.

305
00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:20.231
I ain't loanin' nobody
no money...

306
00:17:20.273 --> 00:17:22.025
so you tell 'em don't even ask.

307
00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:24.402
And I don't want
nobody talking to me...

308
00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:26.988
unless I talk to 'em first.

309
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.699
- You got that?
- Got it.

310
00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:31.952
"Leave the champ alone. "

311
00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:42.212
I know boxing.

312
00:17:42.253 --> 00:17:44.965
I seen a lot of fights.

313
00:17:45.006 --> 00:17:48.343
You're a good champeen,

314
00:17:48.385 --> 00:17:49.886
Who the hell are you?

315
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.763
This is Mendy Ripstein.

316
00:17:51.805 --> 00:17:53.431
He's a very important man
in here.

317
00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:55.016
Ripstein,

318
00:17:55.058 --> 00:17:59.437
Yeah, my manager, Yank Lewis,
he told me to say hello.

319
00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:00.855
I don't remember him.

320
00:18:00.897 --> 00:18:03.358
He said you two
were friends in Miami...

321
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.402
about twenty-five years ago.

322
00:18:05.443 --> 00:18:08.655
I didn't have
any friends in Miami.

323
00:18:08.697 --> 00:18:12.409
A lot of people, they say
they knew me from the old days.

324
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.119
They're full of shit.

325
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.414
You're a good champeen...

326
00:18:17.455 --> 00:18:20.917
but we got a champeen
right here...

327
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:23.753
and he can kick your ass.

328
00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:28.341
Kiddin' me.

329
00:18:28.383 --> 00:18:32.012
I watch all your fights.
You're not as good as you were.

330
00:18:32.053 --> 00:18:34.514
You're just looking
for one big punch.

331
00:18:34.556 --> 00:18:37.309
You're not
throwing combinations.

332
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.146
You're not using as much
head movement on defense.

333
00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:42.397
Yeah, right, old man.

334
00:18:42.439 --> 00:18:44.733
I'm just knocking
motherfuckers out.

335
00:18:44.774 --> 00:18:47.235
Who's the punk in here
you got in mind?

336
00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:51.448
Oh, did I hurt your feelings?

337
00:18:51.489 --> 00:18:54.200
Fuck you.

338
00:18:59.497 --> 00:19:03.335
Heh. Monroe.
Name's Monroe Hutchen.

339
00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:06.087
Mr. Ripstein thinks
he can whip up on you, man...

340
00:19:06.129 --> 00:19:10.425
but no offense. Not trying
to cause any trouble here.

341
00:19:34.908 --> 00:19:36.701
# Hey, yo, it's real in here #

342
00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:38.745
# All of these contenders know
just how it feels in here #

343
00:19:38.787 --> 00:19:40.038
# When you're trin'
to be the top boss #

344
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.414
# Put your gloves on, then #

345
00:19:41.456 --> 00:19:42.791
# This here
be the sport of men #

346
00:19:42.832 --> 00:19:44.209
# Everybody
wants a shot at me #

347
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.543
# One word,
you get knocked out #

348
00:19:45.585 --> 00:19:47.045
# Rocked out the box #

349
00:19:47.087 --> 00:19:48.546
# Only men
leave a place like this #

350
00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:50.215
# Hardcore,
I'm in your face like this #

351
00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:53.051
# Tell your mama that
you'll never come home #

352
00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:11.528
Which one of these suckers
in here is Monroe Hutchen?

353
00:20:11.569 --> 00:20:16.157
He's over there in line,
wearing a white cap.

354
00:20:16.199 --> 00:20:17.993
What's happening, Mo? Yeah.

355
00:20:18.034 --> 00:20:20.453
Brought in
some big guys in here.

356
00:20:20.495 --> 00:20:23.373
He beat 'em all.

357
00:20:23.415 --> 00:20:25.959
It ain't only about being big.

358
00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:28.461
You gotta have skill, son.

359
00:20:39.514 --> 00:20:41.516
You Monroe Hutchen?

360
00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:45.854
Yep.

361
00:20:45.895 --> 00:20:49.482
I guess you know who I am.

362
00:20:49.524 --> 00:20:53.194
Are you the champion in here?

363
00:20:53.236 --> 00:20:55.614
Yeah.

364
00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:58.742
Not the heavyweight champ.

365
00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:02.996
Champion...

366
00:21:03.038 --> 00:21:05.624
heavyweight or
any other kind they got.

367
00:21:05.665 --> 00:21:10.587
I didn't even know they had
boxing in a place like this.

368
00:21:10.629 --> 00:21:13.256
Well, it's a special program.

369
00:21:13.298 --> 00:21:15.842
We only get bouts
ever six months.

370
00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:18.762
Mostly we fight guys
from other prisons.

371
00:21:18.803 --> 00:21:21.222
How long you been on top?

372
00:21:21.264 --> 00:21:24.976
Ten years.
Ever since I got in here.

373
00:21:25.018 --> 00:21:29.022
Damn. Brother, that's
a real fine record you got.

374
00:21:29.064 --> 00:21:31.733
I gotta congratulate you.

375
00:21:31.775 --> 00:21:34.152
Yeah! You want some of this?

376
00:21:34.194 --> 00:21:35.904
Yeah! Come on!

377
00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:37.781
I'm gonna win.

378
00:21:37.822 --> 00:21:39.950
Come on! What?

379
00:21:39.991 --> 00:21:42.786
Ain't no champ in here but me!

380
00:21:44.746 --> 00:21:47.666
I'm giving you another chance.

381
00:21:47.707 --> 00:21:50.585
I'm inclined to overlook
what happened this afternoon...

382
00:21:50.627 --> 00:21:52.629
and not make it a par of
your official record,

383
00:21:54.798 --> 00:21:58.593
Look, let's get something
straight, Mr. Warden.

384
00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:02.263
I'm not just some convict
doing five to ten.

385
00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:05.809
I'm a real big deal.

386
00:22:05.892 --> 00:22:08.144
Not only am I
heavyweight champ...

387
00:22:08.186 --> 00:22:11.314
I'm close to being the most
famous man in the world.

388
00:22:11.356 --> 00:22:12.941
So if you think
you're gonna lean on me...

389
00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:14.526
like these punks
you got in here...

390
00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.777
you better think again...

391
00:22:15.819 --> 00:22:17.904
because if anything
happens to me...

392
00:22:17.946 --> 00:22:21.783
it's gonna be on
the 6:00 news worldwide.

393
00:22:21.825 --> 00:22:23.451
There's gonna be
a whole lot of people...

394
00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:25.537
askin' a whole lot
of questions...

395
00:22:25.578 --> 00:22:27.622
and you and your little crew
here better know that.

396
00:22:27.664 --> 00:22:29.666
Just my luck he got sent here.

397
00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:32.877
Iceman, my ass.
He's just another goddamn thug.

398
00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:35.046
One who happens
to be a world champion...

399
00:22:35.088 --> 00:22:38.008
and a potential
public relations nightmare.

400
00:22:45.515 --> 00:22:48.560
Mr. Hutchen.

401
00:22:48.602 --> 00:22:50.186
You know the little problem...

402
00:22:50.228 --> 00:22:52.480
you had with
the Iceman yesterday?

403
00:22:52.522 --> 00:22:54.274
Got you in some trouble.

404
00:22:55.817 --> 00:22:58.236
Heavyweight champ.

405
00:22:58.278 --> 00:23:00.447
Man gave me a cheap shot.

406
00:23:00.488 --> 00:23:01.990
Yeah, I know,

407
00:23:02.032 --> 00:23:03.742
By the court
and the higher powers...

408
00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:06.620
you contributed to a situation
that threatened violence.

409
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:09.205
One thing you ought
to know by now, Monroe,

410
00:23:09.247 --> 00:23:12.417
Life ain't fair,
Not fair at all,

411
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.427
The warden understands...

412
00:23:22.469 --> 00:23:24.137
what he's doing
is unfortunate...

413
00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:26.431
but unless Mr. Hutchen
and the Iceman are separated...

414
00:23:26.473 --> 00:23:27.932
there will be
enormous pressure...

415
00:23:27.974 --> 00:23:30.268
for another
physical confrontation,

416
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.770
Nobody likes this...

417
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:33.772
but Mr. Hutchen's presence
is an incitement to violence...

418
00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:36.441
and he will be kept in there
until such time...

419
00:23:36.483 --> 00:23:40.070
as we can make arrangements for
his travel to another facility.

420
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.374
OK.

421
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.377
Hey, Monroe.

422
00:23:55.418 --> 00:23:57.420
Take care of yourself
in there, Monroe.

423
00:24:02.634 --> 00:24:08.264
Sergeant Marinez
to the hill tower,

424
00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:14.437
New duty roster just got posted.

425
00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:17.691
You're working
in the kitchen with me.

426
00:24:17.732 --> 00:24:20.402
Look, since we're gonna
be stuck together...

427
00:24:20.443 --> 00:24:24.155
what you in here for?

428
00:24:24.197 --> 00:24:26.199
You know, champ,
I don't mean to be...

429
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:29.160
telling you what to do
or anything, but...

430
00:24:29.202 --> 00:24:33.456
it's not considered polite
to ask why we're here.

431
00:24:33.498 --> 00:24:36.626
Kinda violation of the ethics.
You know, the code?

432
00:24:36.668 --> 00:24:37.836
Yeah.

433
00:24:37.877 --> 00:24:41.298
People take it as disrespect.

434
00:24:41.381 --> 00:24:45.719
Yo! You keeping in shape,
Mr. Iceman?

435
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.847
Who's this chump?

436
00:24:48.888 --> 00:24:52.601
Call him Ratbag.
Runs with Monroe.

437
00:24:52.642 --> 00:24:53.810
Shit.

438
00:24:53.852 --> 00:24:55.895
Thinks he's his manager,

439
00:24:55.937 --> 00:24:58.648
- Ratbag?
- Ratbag.

440
00:25:01.526 --> 00:25:05.947
OK, Ratbag,
what you in here for?

441
00:25:07.991 --> 00:25:10.785
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

442
00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:14.873
Arson.

443
00:25:14.914 --> 00:25:19.044
Nothin' up close and personal.

444
00:25:19.085 --> 00:25:21.504
You hit people much?

445
00:25:21.546 --> 00:25:23.298
What do you mean?

446
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.550
You know, punch people.

447
00:25:25.592 --> 00:25:28.094
When you were a kid
or since you been in here.

448
00:25:28.136 --> 00:25:31.181
Sometimes. Not much.

449
00:25:31.222 --> 00:25:33.058
I never was the physical type.

450
00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:36.019
You want to hit me?

451
00:25:36.061 --> 00:25:40.023
What, are you kidding?

452
00:25:40.106 --> 00:25:42.233
You can say you did it.

453
00:25:42.275 --> 00:25:44.194
"I punched
the heavyweight champ. "

454
00:25:44.235 --> 00:25:45.654
You can tell people
all about it.

455
00:25:45.695 --> 00:25:46.863
It might even make you...

456
00:25:46.905 --> 00:25:49.449
feel good about
your little punk-ass self.

457
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:52.160
I don't want to hit you, Iceman.
Shit!

458
00:25:52.202 --> 00:25:53.370
Sure you do!

459
00:25:53.411 --> 00:25:55.372
You don't even like me.
Come on, man.

460
00:25:55.413 --> 00:25:57.749
Go crazy. Let one go.

461
00:25:57.791 --> 00:26:00.210
If I hit you just this once,
will that end it?

462
00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:01.753
I won't have to hit you anymore?

463
00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:04.005
All you gotta do
is hit me one time...

464
00:26:04.047 --> 00:26:06.424
and I'm telling you, man,
it'll make you feel good...

465
00:26:06.466 --> 00:26:09.094
and it ain't gonna hurt me none.

466
00:26:09.135 --> 00:26:10.929
Aright. Just once.

467
00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:13.348
Just to satisfy whatever
weird trip you're on...

468
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.599
and show you
that I'm a good guy...

469
00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:16.268
trying to do what you want.

470
00:26:16.309 --> 00:26:17.602
Right. Thank you.

471
00:26:17.644 --> 00:26:20.021
You're welcome.

472
00:26:22.816 --> 00:26:23.942
Unh!

473
00:26:23.984 --> 00:26:25.568
Ohh! Yeah, baby!

474
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.406
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
I hit the Iceman!

475
00:26:29.447 --> 00:26:30.615
Yo!

476
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.495
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

477
00:26:35.537 --> 00:26:37.372
You still feel good, Ratbag?

478
00:26:37.414 --> 00:26:39.749
Yeah. I guess so.

479
00:26:39.791 --> 00:26:41.710
You're not mad, are you?

480
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:43.545
Ohh! Damn!

481
00:26:43.586 --> 00:26:45.463
No, I'm not mad at you.

482
00:26:45.505 --> 00:26:48.466
Now, you go tell Monroe
what I said.

483
00:26:48.508 --> 00:26:50.468
Ain't but one champ in here!

484
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.138
And it ain't some
nickel-and-dime convict...

485
00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:55.140
beating up on fools in prison!

486
00:26:55.181 --> 00:26:57.350
Get that bitch outta here.

487
00:27:04.649 --> 00:27:06.318
# Yo, assemble the criminals #

488
00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:09.154
# With subliminal
brought to the forefront #

489
00:27:09.195 --> 00:27:13.325
# Hey, ain't nobody
know I'm in here #

490
00:27:13.366 --> 00:27:15.327
# Check me, you'll learn
to respect me #

491
00:27:15.368 --> 00:27:16.870
# Homeboy, don't correct me #

492
00:27:16.911 --> 00:27:18.413
# I'll call you out,
step on necks #

493
00:27:18.455 --> 00:27:19.914
# Man, I'm better,
stand over #

494
00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:21.625
# Took out them cocky,
wanna be Rocky #

495
00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:23.501
# Niggers that ran up
from the outside #

496
00:27:23.543 --> 00:27:25.295
# The inside my metal cell #

497
00:27:25.337 --> 00:27:27.172
# Who the hell
wanna star bitching #

498
00:27:27.213 --> 00:27:28.673
# Get across in the kitchen #

499
00:27:28.715 --> 00:27:30.342
# End up in the infirmary #

500
00:27:30.383 --> 00:27:31.635
# On close watch, talk shit #

501
00:27:31.676 --> 00:27:33.094
# That ass will get muted #

502
00:27:33.136 --> 00:27:34.512
# Fuckin' with the undisputed #

503
00:27:34.554 --> 00:27:37.223
I ain't gotta spend my time
makin' potato salad.

504
00:27:38.808 --> 00:27:40.018
Where I come from...

505
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.437
we didn't have
any kind of salads.

506
00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:44.773
Where's that?

507
00:27:44.814 --> 00:27:48.276
Indian country. Oklahoma.

508
00:27:48.318 --> 00:27:50.445
Hmm.

509
00:27:50.487 --> 00:27:52.030
Look, man, I know
I'm not supposed to ask...

510
00:27:52.072 --> 00:27:53.823
but what you in here for?

511
00:27:56.326 --> 00:27:58.787
I stole some rich guy's
Mercedes in L.A.

512
00:28:00.997 --> 00:28:04.167
I got a Mercedes. Three of 'em.

513
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.172
Mr. Hutchen.

514
00:28:09.214 --> 00:28:12.342
It's Darlene Early, the G.A.O.
General administration officer.

515
00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:16.262
I need to do
the interview and paperwork...

516
00:28:16.304 --> 00:28:18.139
for your transfer to Folsom.

517
00:28:18.181 --> 00:28:21.393
How are your spirits?
I want you to know...

518
00:28:21.434 --> 00:28:23.103
I'm not in favor
of solitary confinement.

519
00:28:23.144 --> 00:28:25.939
Not for you,
not for anybody else.

520
00:28:25.981 --> 00:28:27.983
It's OK in here.

521
00:28:28.024 --> 00:28:29.526
You can't be serious.

522
00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:32.779
It's all a prison.

523
00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:35.282
I live inside my head.

524
00:28:35.323 --> 00:28:38.076
So that's how
you're doing your time?

525
00:28:38.118 --> 00:28:41.413
Are you really that much
in control of your emotions?

526
00:28:43.456 --> 00:28:46.543
Been that way all my life.

527
00:28:46.584 --> 00:28:50.422
Only time I ever lost it
is what got me in here.

528
00:28:50.463 --> 00:28:54.551
Yeah. I'm familiar
with your case history.

529
00:28:54.592 --> 00:28:57.762
So you prefer your own company?

530
00:28:57.804 --> 00:28:59.806
Most of the time.

531
00:28:59.848 --> 00:29:02.267
I am supposed to recommend
whether or not...

532
00:29:02.309 --> 00:29:05.395
you seem to require a detailed
psychiatric evaluation.

533
00:29:05.437 --> 00:29:07.272
Other than the incident
in the mess hall-

534
00:29:07.314 --> 00:29:08.940
That wasn't me.

535
00:29:08.982 --> 00:29:12.402
Why don't you
go talk to the hotshot champ?

536
00:29:12.444 --> 00:29:14.070
Ask him about it.

537
00:29:14.112 --> 00:29:16.406
So you deny any responsibility?

538
00:29:16.448 --> 00:29:19.951
Yeah, I deny it. How does
that affect me movin' on?

539
00:29:19.993 --> 00:29:23.330
This has no bearing
in your transfer to Folsom.

540
00:29:26.458 --> 00:29:28.418
You know, this whole thing...

541
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.671
this whole thing
is about people bein' scared.

542
00:29:31.713 --> 00:29:33.923
Aren't you afraid of him?

543
00:29:33.965 --> 00:29:37.052
Afraid. Shit, no.

544
00:29:37.093 --> 00:29:38.678
He's a fighter. I'm a fighter.

545
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.388
If I'm better on that day,
I win.

546
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:41.932
That's just the way it goes.

547
00:29:42.015 --> 00:29:46.645
Someday, ever fighter loses.

548
00:29:46.686 --> 00:29:48.396
Sooner or later,
somebody comes along...

549
00:29:48.438 --> 00:29:51.107
and they got your ticket.

550
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:55.695
Too old, just wasn't your day,
whatever the reason is.

551
00:29:55.737 --> 00:29:59.491
in the end,
everybody gets beaten.

552
00:30:00.992 --> 00:30:05.622
The most you can hope for
is that you stay on top a while.

553
00:30:05.664 --> 00:30:07.207
Be the best.

554
00:30:12.087 --> 00:30:14.464
I tried to say hello
to that old gangster.

555
00:30:14.506 --> 00:30:17.092
Ripstein.
He said he don't remember you.

556
00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:20.345
He remembers.
He just don't want to admit it.

557
00:30:20.387 --> 00:30:22.472
Standard mob procedure.

558
00:30:22.514 --> 00:30:24.683
Guys like him deny
they ever had a mother.

559
00:30:24.724 --> 00:30:27.018
Yeah. Right.

560
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.646
How you makin' out, man?

561
00:30:29.688 --> 00:30:32.023
It's shit, but I can handle it.

562
00:30:32.065 --> 00:30:34.442
Yeah. Rumor goin' around
you almost stared a riot.

563
00:30:34.484 --> 00:30:36.486
It was all bullshit, man.

564
00:30:36.528 --> 00:30:39.281
I had to let the peeps in here
know who's the boss.

565
00:30:39.322 --> 00:30:41.491
Just keep
your goddamn nose clean.

566
00:30:41.533 --> 00:30:43.451
You already got
enough problems.

567
00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:46.746
And since they stripped
you of your title...

568
00:30:46.788 --> 00:30:48.790
they're having this
elimination tournament...

569
00:30:48.832 --> 00:30:50.250
to figure out a new champ.

570
00:30:50.292 --> 00:30:53.732
Everybody thinks
Briscoe's a lock to win it.

571
00:30:53.767 --> 00:30:57.173
Word is, Montel's fighting
Jimmy Stubbs in July.

572
00:30:57.215 --> 00:30:59.050
Jimmy Stubbs's a bum.

573
00:30:59.092 --> 00:31:01.886
The good news is
you get outta here...

574
00:31:01.928 --> 00:31:04.389
fight the new champ,
we're looking at...

575
00:31:04.431 --> 00:31:06.224
the biggest payday
of boxing history.

576
00:31:06.266 --> 00:31:08.435
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

577
00:31:08.476 --> 00:31:11.521
The one thing I can tell you,
you lost a lot of fan base...

578
00:31:11.605 --> 00:31:13.732
with this conviction thing.

579
00:31:13.773 --> 00:31:15.650
Fuck the fans.

580
00:31:15.692 --> 00:31:18.361
I get outta here,
I'll get 'em back.

581
00:31:18.403 --> 00:31:23.450
The fans pay your bills,
and don't you ever forget it.

582
00:31:23.491 --> 00:31:26.209
Yeah.

583
00:31:26.244 --> 00:31:28.246
You gotta keep the pressure
on these lawyers, OK...

584
00:31:28.288 --> 00:31:29.623
and get you outta here
to fight this...

585
00:31:29.664 --> 00:31:31.416
big money fight with Briscoe.

586
00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:32.626
Yeah.

587
00:31:32.667 --> 00:31:35.211
You can't be servin'
no full sentence.

588
00:31:35.253 --> 00:31:37.464
You're 35 years old.
Time is tickin'.

589
00:31:37.505 --> 00:31:39.799
Everything
you ever worked for...

590
00:31:39.841 --> 00:31:41.509
it's going
right out the window.

591
00:31:44.721 --> 00:31:46.264
Janiro's an agile boxer...

592
00:31:46.306 --> 00:31:47.849
who has the ability
of a champion,

593
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:49.476
Janiro is fresh off
a victor...

594
00:31:49.517 --> 00:31:51.478
over Charlie Consario,

595
00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:53.063
The Rock turns it on,

596
00:31:53.104 --> 00:31:54.564
It's Le Graziano alone,

597
00:31:54.606 --> 00:31:56.483
He won't give Janiro
punching room,

598
00:31:56.524 --> 00:31:57.776
Stays after his man,

599
00:31:57.817 --> 00:32:00.487
Hits him from all angles,

600
00:32:00.528 --> 00:32:02.030
He remembers things
from a long time ago...

601
00:32:02.072 --> 00:32:03.531
clear as a bell...

602
00:32:03.573 --> 00:32:06.034
but ever day,
I gotta tell him who I am.

603
00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:10.455
He's in another world:
Cuba, forty years ago...

604
00:32:10.497 --> 00:32:12.958
or some fight he saw in 1953.

605
00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:14.542
Then all of a sudden...

606
00:32:14.584 --> 00:32:17.754
he's right there with you,
like everything's normal.

607
00:32:17.796 --> 00:32:20.256
And mean-
he can be mean as shit.

608
00:32:20.298 --> 00:32:22.592
Look, we went to the Emme.

609
00:32:22.634 --> 00:32:24.469
We paid good money
for his protection...

610
00:32:24.511 --> 00:32:25.929
and his personal needs.

611
00:32:25.971 --> 00:32:27.806
They gave you the job.

612
00:32:27.847 --> 00:32:29.641
I got him
an oversized cell-

613
00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:32.769
ground level, so he don't
have to use the stairs.

614
00:32:32.811 --> 00:32:36.481
Food privileges.
Relaxed dress code.

615
00:32:36.523 --> 00:32:37.983
Big easy chair.

616
00:32:38.024 --> 00:32:40.151
I even got him his own
little boxing library.

617
00:32:40.193 --> 00:32:43.405
And he's safe. I promise.

618
00:32:43.446 --> 00:32:46.157
These guys I got, they don't
let any harm come his way.

619
00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:49.160
# It's hard in the yard #

620
00:32:49.202 --> 00:32:51.037
# You can't be sleepin'
or caught off guard #

621
00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:52.872
# When the boys get to creepin'
with sharp objects #

622
00:32:52.914 --> 00:32:55.292
# I'm obsessed with putin'
heads in a permanent rest #

623
00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:57.168
# When I flex
thirty-four-inch biceps #

624
00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:58.878
# Getin' swell,
might put your lights out #

625
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.088
# Spend the night
in the hole, in here #

626
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.548
# Ever hear is cold #

627
00:33:01.589 --> 00:33:02.674
# It's the gatherin'
of lost souls #

628
00:33:02.716 --> 00:33:04.301
# No self-control #

629
00:33:04.342 --> 00:33:05.969
# Connected with the gangsters
runnin' this shit #

630
00:33:06.011 --> 00:33:07.595
# From the inside,
so there's nowhere to hide #

631
00:33:07.637 --> 00:33:11.224
# Tell your mama that
you'll never come home #

632
00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:12.475
Hey, chief.

633
00:33:13.602 --> 00:33:14.811
Mmm.

634
00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:18.732
How you getting along
with your new cellmate?

635
00:33:18.773 --> 00:33:22.068
- He's OK.
- Mmm.

636
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.447
Rumor has it he took down
one of the skinheads.

637
00:33:27.073 --> 00:33:31.328
A lot of rumors in prison,
you know?

638
00:33:31.369 --> 00:33:34.247
Ah, probably deserved it anyway.

639
00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:35.874
Maybe.

640
00:33:45.133 --> 00:33:47.636
We hear you don't want to
associate with anybody here.

641
00:33:47.677 --> 00:33:51.056
Maybe you got
way too much attitude, man.

642
00:34:00.607 --> 00:34:02.400
Unh.

643
00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:06.404
Aaron's an expert.
He's the man on appeals.

644
00:34:06.446 --> 00:34:08.490
But before we talk
about your appeal...

645
00:34:08.531 --> 00:34:11.409
I need to tell you about
Miss Tawnee Rawlins.

646
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:14.829
She's filed a civil lawsuit
in the amount of $75 million.

647
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:17.999
You handlin' that?

648
00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:20.752
I'd recommend
an outside attorney.

649
00:34:20.794 --> 00:34:21.962
Another specialist.

650
00:34:22.003 --> 00:34:24.881
However, we can handle
your tax litigation.

651
00:34:24.923 --> 00:34:27.258
The government has filed
an intent to audit.

652
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.260
We have someone in the firm
that can deal with that.

653
00:34:29.302 --> 00:34:30.428
Is any of this covered...

654
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:32.806
by the $2 million
I already paid you?

655
00:34:32.847 --> 00:34:35.016
We get the same deal as you get.

656
00:34:35.058 --> 00:34:38.478
You get paid win or lose.
So do we.

657
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.855
There are a couple
of procedural areas...

658
00:34:40.897 --> 00:34:44.025
that are still in question-
possible reversible error.

659
00:34:44.067 --> 00:34:47.445
But I'm not gonna kid you.
I'd make us a long shot.

660
00:34:47.487 --> 00:34:49.572
You're looking at
a six- to eight-year sentence...

661
00:34:49.614 --> 00:34:52.117
with possible time off
for good behavior.

662
00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:53.952
Now, in California,
that means...

663
00:34:53.994 --> 00:34:57.163
you're eligible for parole
in four years.

664
00:34:57.205 --> 00:34:58.373
What you need to focus on...

665
00:34:58.415 --> 00:35:00.250
is if you become
a model prisoner...

666
00:35:00.292 --> 00:35:02.377
exhibit
special circumstances...

667
00:35:02.419 --> 00:35:04.379
you could be considered
for a work furlough...

668
00:35:04.421 --> 00:35:06.298
as soon as eighteen months
to two years.

669
00:35:08.466 --> 00:35:10.677
So it don't matter
whether I did it or not?

670
00:35:10.719 --> 00:35:11.886
It doesn't work that way.

671
00:35:11.928 --> 00:35:13.603
Justice and the law
are separate issues.

672
00:35:13.638 --> 00:35:16.349
Let's get back to
some of your other problems.

673
00:35:16.391 --> 00:35:17.601
We've done an audit.

674
00:35:17.642 --> 00:35:20.061
Your financial situation
is a mess.

675
00:35:20.103 --> 00:35:21.938
- No, that's bullshit.
- No bullshit.

676
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.817
Big financial settlements
with your ex-wives, entourage.

677
00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:27.611
Bad investments
and misrepresentations...

678
00:35:27.652 --> 00:35:29.112
by your ex-business manager.

679
00:35:29.154 --> 00:35:30.530
I'm gonna sue that motherfucker.

680
00:35:30.572 --> 00:35:34.451
And what about this IRS shit?
Where do I stand on that?

681
00:35:34.492 --> 00:35:37.954
By the firm's calculations,
you could end up owing them...

682
00:35:37.996 --> 00:35:41.333
$7 million in back taxes,
and that's just the feds.

683
00:35:41.374 --> 00:35:44.044
Then there's the state.
The bottom line-

684
00:35:44.085 --> 00:35:46.338
we need to get
your black ass outta here...

685
00:35:46.379 --> 00:35:47.756
and back in the ring.

686
00:36:06.733 --> 00:36:08.443
Clive Johnson
here ringside...

687
00:36:08.485 --> 00:36:10.528
for KHIL Channel 13
in the Bay Area,

688
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.198
Next, round seven
of the California...

689
00:36:13.281 --> 00:36:14.991
state heavyweight
championship fight...

690
00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:19.829
here from the Palmer Arena
in downtown Oakland,

691
00:36:19.871 --> 00:36:21.456
Challenger Monroe Hutchen's
undefeated...

692
00:36:21.498 --> 00:36:23.291
takin' on
state champ Butch Davis...

693
00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:25.460
in what, so far,
has been a nearly even fight,

694
00:36:25.502 --> 00:36:27.177
There's the bell!

695
00:36:27.212 --> 00:36:29.172
Davis has a bad cut
above his left eye...

696
00:36:29.214 --> 00:36:30.423
and Monroe Hutchen
looks like...

697
00:36:30.465 --> 00:36:32.509
he wants to do
something about it,

698
00:36:34.094 --> 00:36:36.513
It's all Monroe,
it's all Monroe!

699
00:36:37.764 --> 00:36:40.058
A big right hand,
Another right!

700
00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.436
Davis is down,
and this fight is over!

701
00:36:43.478 --> 00:36:46.481
After forty-three seconds
in the seventh round...

702
00:36:46.523 --> 00:36:48.275
Monroe Hutchen is the new...

703
00:36:48.316 --> 00:36:50.443
California state
heavyweight champion!

704
00:36:56.533 --> 00:36:58.368
Your attorneys have
come to me and asked me...

705
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.662
to handle your response
to the plaintiff's filing,

706
00:37:00.704 --> 00:37:04.124
As you know, you are now facing
a separate civil suit...

707
00:37:04.165 --> 00:37:05.583
that may well go to trial...

708
00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:08.378
over the criminal charges
you've been convicted of.

709
00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.798
Briefly, "That on March 17,
you and four other men...

710
00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:13.425
"took six women
via private jet...

711
00:37:13.466 --> 00:37:15.010
"from Las Vegas
to Los Angeles-"

712
00:37:15.051 --> 00:37:16.219
Showgirls.

713
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:18.847
"At approximately 1:30 p. m...

714
00:37:18.888 --> 00:37:20.432
"you checked into
the penthouse suite...

715
00:37:20.515 --> 00:37:21.933
"of the Beverly Manor hotel. "

716
00:37:21.975 --> 00:37:24.728
Until that point of the evening,
all parties concede...

717
00:37:24.769 --> 00:37:26.730
but for minor discrepancies,
the foregoing is true.

718
00:37:26.771 --> 00:37:28.481
What happened next
is in question.

719
00:37:28.523 --> 00:37:31.735
No question.
I ain't no punk-ass rapist.

720
00:37:31.776 --> 00:37:33.612
She wanted it.

721
00:37:33.653 --> 00:37:36.364
Look. None of this makes
any difference at this point.

722
00:37:36.406 --> 00:37:37.949
We're just trying
to get an over-

723
00:37:37.991 --> 00:37:40.160
No. She didn't say no.
She ain't say shit.

724
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:41.328
She didn't have a problem
with any of it.

725
00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:43.955
Miss Rawlins
effectively convinced...

726
00:37:43.997 --> 00:37:45.582
the criminal trial jury
that she believed that...

727
00:37:45.624 --> 00:37:47.792
you could break her
in two with one arm.

728
00:37:47.834 --> 00:37:49.294
Yeah, uh-huh.

729
00:37:49.336 --> 00:37:52.547
That's why she was makin'
all them happy sounds...

730
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:55.550
'cause I was killin' her,
right?

731
00:37:55.592 --> 00:37:57.594
Some women like it rough.

732
00:37:59.387 --> 00:38:01.264
You know anything about that?

733
00:38:01.306 --> 00:38:03.892
That wasn't par
of your testimony.

734
00:38:03.934 --> 00:38:07.938
A lawyer said don't sound
like I'm calling her a ho.

735
00:38:07.979 --> 00:38:10.357
The prosecution
pegged you as a bully.

736
00:38:10.398 --> 00:38:13.818
And she could explain it away
easily enough by saying...

737
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.322
that you mistook what were
in fact her cries for help...

738
00:38:17.364 --> 00:38:18.698
for she was just in pain.

739
00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.452
I heard pain before,
and-ha ha ha-

740
00:38:22.494 --> 00:38:25.372
believe me,
she wasn't in no pain.

741
00:38:25.413 --> 00:38:27.791
She's asking $75 million...

742
00:38:27.832 --> 00:38:31.544
but I don't like negotiating
with your appeal pending.

743
00:38:31.586 --> 00:38:35.131
No negotiatin'.
I ain't givin' that bitch shit.

744
00:38:37.968 --> 00:38:42.597
And then when he finished,
he just put back on his pants...

745
00:38:42.639 --> 00:38:45.934
and went back out
into the party...

746
00:38:45.976 --> 00:38:47.519
and left me alone.

747
00:38:53.984 --> 00:38:55.151
# Ohh #

748
00:38:55.193 --> 00:38:56.444
# Man up #

749
00:38:57.862 --> 00:38:59.364
# Man up #

750
00:38:59.406 --> 00:39:00.573
# Motherfucker,
you are now in jail #

751
00:39:00.615 --> 00:39:02.242
# Man up #

752
00:39:02.284 --> 00:39:04.411
# Motherfucker, where
it's strange as hell #

753
00:39:04.452 --> 00:39:06.663
# 'Cause you's
a no-booty and so... #

754
00:39:06.705 --> 00:39:08.164
# Man up #

755
00:39:08.206 --> 00:39:09.499
# Motherfucker, get your
manhood took #

756
00:39:09.541 --> 00:39:10.709
# Man up #

757
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.294
Champ...

758
00:39:12.335 --> 00:39:15.338
I'm looking to be
your friend, Champ,

759
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.716
I'm a gift.

760
00:39:17.757 --> 00:39:20.218
Well, I don't need no gifts.

761
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.227
Who sent you?

762
00:39:22.262 --> 00:39:25.849
Saladin.
He want to be your friend.

763
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:29.102
He kind of run things
for El Faziz Assassins.

764
00:39:29.144 --> 00:39:31.313
You can check it out.

765
00:39:31.354 --> 00:39:33.523
You kind of pretty for a bitch.

766
00:39:33.565 --> 00:39:35.859
But I don't want to owe nobody.

767
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.341
You tell him I said that.
Now get outta here.

768
00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:42.782
You may be the champ,
but you are only one guy.

769
00:39:42.824 --> 00:39:44.618
Let me help you out.

770
00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:49.122
El Faziz Assassins give you
something, you take it.

771
00:39:49.164 --> 00:39:51.207
You do not refuse.

772
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.349
I'm looking for Saladin.

773
00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:14.147
Pleased to meet a man of
your great accomplishments.

774
00:40:14.189 --> 00:40:15.982
You run shit here?

775
00:40:17.609 --> 00:40:19.819
There's strength in unity,
brother.

776
00:40:20.987 --> 00:40:23.490
In here we need cooperation
and understanding.

777
00:40:24.741 --> 00:40:26.993
We are at times
discriminated against...

778
00:40:27.028 --> 00:40:29.663
even within these walls.

779
00:40:29.704 --> 00:40:31.498
Now, if you wish to come
and join with us-

780
00:40:31.539 --> 00:40:32.707
Oh!

781
00:40:35.001 --> 00:40:39.965
Brother,
if you don't join with us...

782
00:40:40.006 --> 00:40:42.759
you'll be destroying
the unity we create.

783
00:41:25.552 --> 00:41:27.971
Warden wants to see you.

784
00:41:28.013 --> 00:41:30.765
That's quite a show
you put on there.

785
00:41:30.807 --> 00:41:33.018
Come on. Let's go.

786
00:41:37.397 --> 00:41:38.565
I'm disappointed.

787
00:41:38.607 --> 00:41:42.367
Three incidents already,
one a near riot...

788
00:41:42.402 --> 00:41:44.571
one an assault and now
a physical confrontation...

789
00:41:44.613 --> 00:41:46.573
that has sent five men
to the hospital...

790
00:41:46.615 --> 00:41:48.199
for medical treatment.

791
00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:50.410
You've only been here ten weeks.
It is undeniable-

792
00:41:50.445 --> 00:41:53.121
you are making
a very poor record.

793
00:41:53.163 --> 00:41:55.540
The whole thing is,
they got to respect you...

794
00:41:55.582 --> 00:41:57.709
or you nothin'.

795
00:41:57.792 --> 00:41:59.002
I believe that
you're missing the point.

796
00:41:59.044 --> 00:42:00.587
The warden is trying
to explain the idea...

797
00:42:00.629 --> 00:42:02.047
of acceptable behavior.

798
00:42:04.174 --> 00:42:07.552
I'm trying to explain to him
how to survive.

799
00:42:07.594 --> 00:42:09.554
I don't think there
are too many inmates here...

800
00:42:09.596 --> 00:42:12.557
who could challenge you
physically, Mr. Chambers.

801
00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:15.560
You really don't understand.

802
00:42:15.602 --> 00:42:20.148
When you're the champ,
everybody wants a piece of you.

803
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.484
Everybody’s testing you.

804
00:42:22.525 --> 00:42:27.948
My whole life, I got a problem,
I take care of it with these.

805
00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:30.784
People love a guy who can fight.

806
00:42:30.825 --> 00:42:35.455
Money, pussy, kiss your ass,
put you on TV...

807
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.624
put your picture
in papers, magazines...

808
00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:41.461
anything I want, because people
love a guy who can fight...

809
00:42:41.496 --> 00:42:43.380
and don't take shit.

810
00:43:13.994 --> 00:43:15.412
# Murder #

811
00:43:15.453 --> 00:43:17.455
# The choice I made,
so now I pay #

812
00:43:17.497 --> 00:43:18.999
# Thinkin' back,
I have to ask #

813
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.465
# How'd it end this way? #

814
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.419
# You see,
it all happened so fast #

815
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.795
# I couldn't think twice #

816
00:43:23.837 --> 00:43:25.338
# Now I'm chillin'
for killin' #

817
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.173
# And I'm payin' the price #

818
00:43:31.177 --> 00:43:33.597
Who I'm with is none
of your business!

819
00:43:33.638 --> 00:43:35.348
None of my business?
I'll deal with you-

820
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:37.684
Stop it!
You're killing him!

821
00:43:43.023 --> 00:43:46.067
On the night
of December 1, 1990...

822
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:49.029
you beat a man to death
with your bare fists...

823
00:43:49.064 --> 00:43:50.989
which because
of your profession...

824
00:43:51.031 --> 00:43:52.490
and your training
are considered...

825
00:43:52.532 --> 00:43:55.577
to be lethal weapons
in the state of California,

826
00:43:55.619 --> 00:43:57.996
You've been found guilty
by a jury of your peers...

827
00:43:58.038 --> 00:43:59.789
and you are sentenced
to life imprisonment...

828
00:43:59.831 --> 00:44:02.542
without the possibility
of parole,

829
00:44:10.175 --> 00:44:12.719
Good morning, Mr. Ripstein.
How are you today?

830
00:44:12.761 --> 00:44:14.346
Don't give me no shit.

831
00:44:14.387 --> 00:44:15.931
How the hell
is the fight comin'?

832
00:44:15.972 --> 00:44:17.474
What fight?

833
00:44:17.515 --> 00:44:20.518
We got the heavyweight
champion of the world...

834
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.146
and an unbeaten prospect
right here in Sweetwater.

835
00:44:23.188 --> 00:44:26.191
Quit wasting time.
Set the fuckin' thing up.

836
00:44:26.232 --> 00:44:27.532
I know fights.

837
00:44:27.567 --> 00:44:31.154
Long prize,
Monroe kicks his ass...

838
00:44:31.196 --> 00:44:33.198
we can make
a lot of money here.

839
00:44:34.658 --> 00:44:38.578
Mr. Ripstein, excuse me,
but you're talking about...

840
00:44:38.613 --> 00:44:41.581
the real heavyweight
champion of the world.

841
00:44:41.616 --> 00:44:43.583
Are you gonna fix the fight?

842
00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:45.168
Shit no. Boxing.

843
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.505
It's a matter of style.
They all can be beaten.

844
00:44:48.546 --> 00:44:52.175
Right time, right place,
the right circumstance...

845
00:44:52.217 --> 00:44:55.262
they all can be beaten.

846
00:44:57.264 --> 00:44:59.516
Mr. Ripstein wants
to see the Iceman...

847
00:44:59.557 --> 00:45:01.518
fight a prisoner
we got in here.

848
00:45:01.559 --> 00:45:03.520
His name is Monroe Hutchen.

849
00:45:03.561 --> 00:45:07.065
And a real goddamn fight. Pure.

850
00:45:07.107 --> 00:45:09.859
So, what do you want us to do?

851
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:13.029
I talked to the head guard.
He's OK.

852
00:45:13.071 --> 00:45:14.531
But the warden's a problem.

853
00:45:14.572 --> 00:45:16.741
Mr. Ripstein said
you can take care of him.

854
00:45:16.783 --> 00:45:19.918
You know the drill.

855
00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:23.623
You help him or you hurt him.

856
00:45:24.791 --> 00:45:27.627
Now... about Monroe Hutchen.

857
00:45:28.962 --> 00:45:30.547
The warden thinks it's time...

858
00:45:30.588 --> 00:45:32.549
to give him a chance
to rehabilitate himself...

859
00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.176
by socializing
with the other prisoners.

860
00:45:35.218 --> 00:45:37.554
In six weeks,
I'm going on vacation.

861
00:45:37.596 --> 00:45:39.097
On the fifth,
I'll be gone for two weeks.

862
00:45:39.139 --> 00:45:40.682
First week in New Orleans...

863
00:45:40.724 --> 00:45:43.768
second week visiting friends
in Tucson, Arizona.

864
00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.145
If while I am gone...

865
00:45:45.186 --> 00:45:47.981
if Mr. Hutchen happens to
get into a sparring match...

866
00:45:48.016 --> 00:45:50.567
with Mr. Chambers,
I don't want to hear about it.

867
00:45:50.609 --> 00:45:51.950
And when I get back...

868
00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:55.155
I want this whole goddamned
enterprise finished.

869
00:45:55.196 --> 00:45:56.364
Yes, sir.

870
00:45:56.406 --> 00:45:58.158
Leaving no evidence,
no videotape...

871
00:45:58.199 --> 00:46:00.702
and never to be spoken of
in my presence.

872
00:46:00.744 --> 00:46:02.329
- Anything else, sir?
- Hit the yard.

873
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:03.622
Thank you.

874
00:46:06.499 --> 00:46:08.335
Had to have been somebody
in the governor's office.

875
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:09.502
Soon as he got the call...

876
00:46:09.544 --> 00:46:11.338
Mr. Backbone stared
arranging his vacation.

877
00:46:11.373 --> 00:46:12.505
Know what that means,
don't you?

878
00:46:12.547 --> 00:46:14.716
This whole load of shit
comes down on you and me.

879
00:46:14.758 --> 00:46:16.426
There is no "you and me. "

880
00:46:16.468 --> 00:46:18.511
I'm taking my vacation
right along with the warden.

881
00:46:18.553 --> 00:46:20.472
Well, thank you
for your support.

882
00:46:20.513 --> 00:46:23.516
Oh, come on.
You run the fight program here.

883
00:46:23.558 --> 00:46:25.518
You want this to happen.

884
00:46:39.991 --> 00:46:41.333
Here we go, Monroe.

885
00:46:41.368 --> 00:46:43.995
Free at last, free at last.

886
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.167
- I'm not going to Folsom.
- What can I tell you?

887
00:46:49.209 --> 00:46:52.504
Looks like the warden
went and changed his mind.

888
00:46:52.545 --> 00:46:54.506
You get to stay home with us.

889
00:47:01.221 --> 00:47:04.099
Yeah, Operator,
a collect call to Yank Lewis.

890
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.102
No. Yank Lewis.

891
00:47:07.143 --> 00:47:10.397
From George Chambers,
the Iceman.

892
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.110
Yank. Yeah, man, it's me.

893
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:17.445
Who the hell you think it is?

894
00:47:17.487 --> 00:47:20.657
Get your ass up here
and share the beauty.

895
00:47:20.699 --> 00:47:23.410
Maybe I gotaa ticket
back on the gravy train,

896
00:47:23.451 --> 00:47:25.328
What?
What are you talking about?

897
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:27.664
Remember your old buddy
from Miami, Mendy Ripstein?

898
00:47:27.706 --> 00:47:29.124
Yeah,

899
00:47:29.165 --> 00:47:31.126
His boy came up to me
and said...

900
00:47:31.167 --> 00:47:33.128
that if I fight
some punk in here...

901
00:47:33.169 --> 00:47:35.130
he could maybe
get me out quick.

902
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:40.135
If Mendy Ripstein says it,
then it's the real deal.

903
00:47:40.176 --> 00:47:42.554
But you can't hear this
from some other guy.

904
00:47:42.596 --> 00:47:45.015
You gotta hear this
from Mendy himself.

905
00:47:45.056 --> 00:47:46.558
Then it's dope for sure.

906
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.477
If it's on the real,
I'll whip on this punk's ass...

907
00:47:49.519 --> 00:47:51.146
and be out of here.

908
00:47:51.187 --> 00:47:54.670
Who's the punk?
Don't tell me Monroe Hutchen.

909
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:58.153
He fought out of Oakland.
He was undefeated.

910
00:47:58.194 --> 00:48:01.906
He was a real prospect, man.
He's a full load.

911
00:48:01.948 --> 00:48:05.035
Even if he was something,
he's been in here for ten years.

912
00:48:05.076 --> 00:48:08.371
I'm just saying it might not be
a walk in the park.

913
00:48:08.413 --> 00:48:10.436
- I don't believe this shit.
- What?

914
00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:12.459
You worried about me
being out of shape.

915
00:48:12.494 --> 00:48:13.793
I've been in here
for four months.

916
00:48:13.835 --> 00:48:15.420
That chump been in here
for ten years.

917
00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:18.298
- You too much, man.
- What? That's concern-

918
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.925
Get the fuck outta here.

919
00:48:22.802 --> 00:48:25.103
Yes, I want you to fight him,

920
00:48:25.138 --> 00:48:30.018
In the cage, no gloves,
bare-fisted, to the finish,

921
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.938
I make a couple of calls,
I put down some money...

922
00:48:32.979 --> 00:48:34.606
There's some people
on the outside...

923
00:48:34.648 --> 00:48:37.449
that know you,
everybody knows him...

924
00:48:37.484 --> 00:48:40.195
we'll get maybe twenty,
thirty-to-one odds,

925
00:48:40.236 --> 00:48:43.365
It's easy to spread around,
maybe two hundred thousand,

926
00:48:43.406 --> 00:48:48.286
You win, that's
four million bucks, maybe more.

927
00:48:50.497 --> 00:48:54.209
And I think he can't wait.

928
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.970
What's in it for me?

929
00:48:59.005 --> 00:49:00.548
Mr. Ripstein
uses his influence...

930
00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.592
you stay out of solitar...

931
00:49:02.634 --> 00:49:04.636
get the privileges
you been missing.

932
00:49:04.678 --> 00:49:08.306
Privileges?

933
00:49:08.348 --> 00:49:10.475
Offer me half the profit,

934
00:49:10.517 --> 00:49:12.102
Oh, I don't think so.

935
00:49:12.143 --> 00:49:15.730
I'm putting up all the dough
on a real long shot.

936
00:49:15.772 --> 00:49:17.399
I'm taking all the risk.

937
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.192
What are you worried
about money for?

938
00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:21.319
What are you gonna
buy in here?

939
00:49:21.361 --> 00:49:24.114
You in here, too.

940
00:49:24.155 --> 00:49:26.199
Probably gonna die in here.

941
00:49:26.241 --> 00:49:28.451
What the money matter to you?

942
00:49:28.493 --> 00:49:30.912
You're gonna get ten percent.

943
00:49:30.954 --> 00:49:33.123
I know that fighters
usually get...

944
00:49:33.164 --> 00:49:35.542
fifty percent, minimum,
on the outside.

945
00:49:35.583 --> 00:49:39.379
Yeah, but we're not outside.

946
00:49:39.414 --> 00:49:41.256
I want more.

947
00:49:43.174 --> 00:49:45.135
I got a sister,
she got three kids...

948
00:49:45.176 --> 00:49:47.519
no job, no skills, no husband.

949
00:49:47.554 --> 00:49:51.433
Government gives her
a check once a month.

950
00:49:51.474 --> 00:49:53.435
I could send her the money.

951
00:49:53.476 --> 00:49:58.481
You're gonna get thirty percent
of everything we win.

952
00:49:58.523 --> 00:50:00.442
It's a deal?

953
00:50:00.483 --> 00:50:02.485
Forty percent.

954
00:50:02.527 --> 00:50:04.195
That's it.

955
00:50:20.211 --> 00:50:22.380
You wanted to see the Iceman?

956
00:50:22.422 --> 00:50:24.507
Mr. Ripstein thanks you
for bringing him...

957
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:26.009
to this neutral location.

958
00:50:30.472 --> 00:50:33.058
The Iceman doesn't want
any disappointments.

959
00:50:33.099 --> 00:50:35.936
He expects to negotiate.

960
00:50:37.562 --> 00:50:38.730
You have to understand...

961
00:50:38.772 --> 00:50:41.399
that Mr. Ripstein is
a great boxing enthusiast...

962
00:50:41.441 --> 00:50:43.526
a great student of the art...

963
00:50:43.568 --> 00:50:46.196
a great historian
of the prize ring.

964
00:50:46.237 --> 00:50:48.531
Mr. Ripstein
believes the truest...

965
00:50:48.573 --> 00:50:50.533
purest expression
of the sport...

966
00:50:50.575 --> 00:50:53.536
was the bare-knuckle fights
of the Nineteenth Century...

967
00:50:53.578 --> 00:50:55.413
the Queensbury rules.

968
00:50:55.455 --> 00:50:59.209
Oh, no, no.
The London Prize Ring rules.

969
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:03.546
Queensbury changed the rules
to the ones that we got now.

970
00:51:03.588 --> 00:51:05.966
Look, let's cut through
all this bullshit.

971
00:51:06.007 --> 00:51:08.343
I want out.
Otherwise, no fight.

972
00:51:08.385 --> 00:51:09.803
How you gonna pull it off?

973
00:51:11.513 --> 00:51:14.140
We handle that through
the Department of Corrections.

974
00:51:14.182 --> 00:51:15.642
We got a guy on the committee.

975
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.981
I got your word on this?

976
00:51:22.607 --> 00:51:25.443
You better get ready to fight.

977
00:51:25.485 --> 00:51:27.153
# Train all day #

978
00:51:27.195 --> 00:51:29.114
# You know I gotta feel
the pain all day #

979
00:51:29.155 --> 00:51:30.907
# Work hard even if
it rain on me #

980
00:51:30.949 --> 00:51:32.909
# Nothing less than
five miles in the morning #

981
00:51:32.951 --> 00:51:34.452
# I'm jogging and yawning #

982
00:51:34.494 --> 00:51:36.413
# Stick and move,
intense, here we go #

983
00:51:36.454 --> 00:51:37.831
# One, two,
come up the ring now #

984
00:51:37.872 --> 00:51:39.297
# What you gonna do? #

985
00:51:39.332 --> 00:51:41.668
# Showboat when
I expose the ribs #

986
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:43.295
# Watch for the hook #

987
00:51:43.336 --> 00:51:45.005
# Place bets, hey,
money on the books #

988
00:51:45.046 --> 00:51:46.840
# You ain't seen a fight
till you seen what I took #

989
00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:48.807
# I got precision,
the jab keep you #

990
00:51:48.842 --> 00:51:50.510
# At the perfect distance,
and it can be done #

991
00:51:53.638 --> 00:51:55.932
The fight is six weeks
from tomorrow night.

992
00:51:55.974 --> 00:51:58.310
Y'all got that amount of time
to get your fighters in shape.

993
00:51:58.351 --> 00:51:59.853
These are the rules.

994
00:51:59.894 --> 00:52:01.855
Mr. Ripstein has gone
through a lot of trouble...

995
00:52:01.896 --> 00:52:03.398
putting them together.

996
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.526
What about a foul?
Who's gonna ref this thing?

997
00:52:06.568 --> 00:52:09.154
There isn't any referee.
That's one of the rules.

998
00:52:09.195 --> 00:52:11.197
What kind of shit is this, huh?

999
00:52:11.239 --> 00:52:14.159
Mr. Mercker can judge fouls
from outside the cage.

1000
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.535
No kicking, butting, low blows.

1001
00:52:15.577 --> 00:52:17.954
If you win or lose on a foul,
all deals are off.

1002
00:52:17.996 --> 00:52:19.337
This is a bunch of crap, OK?

1003
00:52:19.372 --> 00:52:21.708
My guy's got a lot more to lose
than this other chump.

1004
00:52:21.743 --> 00:52:24.377
Nowhere to train properly,

1005
00:52:24.419 --> 00:52:28.089
First there's no gloves,
then these dumbass rules.

1006
00:52:28.131 --> 00:52:31.092
Truth is, we don't know shit
about fighting this way.

1007
00:52:31.134 --> 00:52:32.677
And that makes you even.

1008
00:52:34.596 --> 00:52:36.264
# Train all day #

1009
00:52:36.306 --> 00:52:38.016
# Even though I gotta feel
the pain all day #

1010
00:52:38.058 --> 00:52:39.893
# Work hard even if
it rain on me #

1011
00:52:39.935 --> 00:52:41.811
# Nothing less than
five miles in the morning #

1012
00:52:41.853 --> 00:52:43.355
# I'm jogging and yawning #

1013
00:52:43.396 --> 00:52:45.398
# Stick and move,
intense, here we go #

1014
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.108
# One, two,
come up the ring now #

1015
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:48.526
# What you gonna do? #

1016
00:52:48.568 --> 00:52:50.236
# Showboat when
I expose the ribs #

1017
00:53:05.585 --> 00:53:07.587
# It's the standard
arrangement #

1018
00:53:07.629 --> 00:53:09.464
# Trust me,
they'll crown me the king #

1019
00:53:09.506 --> 00:53:11.591
# Learn a routine
and get between #

1020
00:53:22.602 --> 00:53:24.562
# Because I'm still
the champeen #

1021
00:53:29.609 --> 00:53:32.195
Mr. Ripstein, I don't
want to cause no trouble,

1022
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.781
I wanted to talk to you
about the rules, you know?

1023
00:53:34.823 --> 00:53:36.157
Actually, about the gloves.

1024
00:53:36.199 --> 00:53:37.415
There aren't any gloves.

1025
00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:39.077
It says so on page three
of the rules.

1026
00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:42.580
Yeah, I know,
but it'll make for a dull fight.

1027
00:53:42.622 --> 00:53:45.292
I mean, bare knuckles,
nobody throws a lot.

1028
00:53:45.333 --> 00:53:46.835
If you watch those old films...

1029
00:53:46.876 --> 00:53:49.838
of Jack Johnson
and Jeffries and Cornet-

1030
00:53:49.879 --> 00:53:52.674
Those guys were trained
in bare-knuckle style, you know?

1031
00:53:52.716 --> 00:53:55.677
It was like a news flash
when somebody threw a punch.

1032
00:53:55.719 --> 00:53:57.512
I just want to make it
clear that I agree...

1033
00:53:57.554 --> 00:53:59.055
but my boy?
He don't give a shit.

1034
00:53:59.097 --> 00:54:00.724
Gloves, no gloves,
it don't matter.

1035
00:54:00.765 --> 00:54:03.476
Bring him on.
We ain't backing up for nobody.

1036
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:05.103
Jab, baby! That's right, jab!

1037
00:54:05.145 --> 00:54:07.606
Be a lot more
hitting with gloves.

1038
00:54:07.647 --> 00:54:09.858
I gave you a copy of
the London Prize Fight Rules...

1039
00:54:09.899 --> 00:54:12.569
that Mr. Ripstein typed out,
and it says "No gloves. "

1040
00:54:12.611 --> 00:54:17.115
No. Wait a minute.
He's right.

1041
00:54:17.157 --> 00:54:20.535
It's a better fight
with six-ounce gloves.

1042
00:54:20.577 --> 00:54:21.745
Get 'em,

1043
00:54:48.688 --> 00:54:51.650
Monroe!
How you doing, brother?

1044
00:54:55.028 --> 00:54:59.616
First, there's a smile,
then comes a cheap shot, huh?

1045
00:54:59.658 --> 00:55:04.037
I guess nobody's dumb enough
to fall for that twice, huh?

1046
00:55:04.072 --> 00:55:07.999
You got that right, Mr. Iceman.

1047
00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:10.210
You can call me Champ.

1048
00:55:10.251 --> 00:55:13.191
Now see, you've been told.

1049
00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:16.132
In here, I'm the champ.

1050
00:55:16.174 --> 00:55:19.636
You believe that, you must
believe in the tooth fair.

1051
00:55:19.678 --> 00:55:21.805
Nobody's backing up.

1052
00:55:28.061 --> 00:55:31.481
Hold on, brother.
You gonna get your chance.

1053
00:55:35.527 --> 00:55:37.779
Good evening,
I'm Maureen O'Boyle,

1054
00:55:37.821 --> 00:55:40.949
Tonight on CNO X's
"The inside Story"...

1055
00:55:40.991 --> 00:55:43.159
we'll be talking
with Tawnee Rawlins...

1056
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:44.494
in an exclusive interview...

1057
00:55:44.536 --> 00:55:46.955
that will be her
first public statement...

1058
00:55:46.997 --> 00:55:49.499
since the sensational
trial and conviction...

1059
00:55:49.541 --> 00:55:51.626
of George "Iceman" Chambers...

1060
00:55:51.668 --> 00:55:54.087
former heavyweight
champion of the world.

1061
00:55:54.129 --> 00:55:55.672
Thanks for being
with us, Tawnee.

1062
00:55:57.173 --> 00:55:59.259
I was scared.

1063
00:55:59.301 --> 00:56:02.220
I didn't want
to be there anymore.

1064
00:56:04.139 --> 00:56:08.643
I- I didn't want
to do nothing with him...

1065
00:56:08.685 --> 00:56:12.022
but he wouldn't stop.

1066
00:56:12.063 --> 00:56:14.816
This whole thing
is just such a mess.

1067
00:56:14.858 --> 00:56:16.443
I've been out of work...

1068
00:56:16.484 --> 00:56:18.403
since this
whole thing happened...

1069
00:56:18.445 --> 00:56:20.947
and I had to have lots
of doctors and lawyers...

1070
00:56:20.989 --> 00:56:22.574
and I got stacks of mail
from people...

1071
00:56:22.616 --> 00:56:23.950
saying that they hate me...

1072
00:56:23.992 --> 00:56:25.827
because I took away
their heavyweight champ...

1073
00:56:25.869 --> 00:56:27.621
and that I'm a gold digger
and all that...

1074
00:56:27.656 --> 00:56:30.165
but I say
walk a mile in my shoes.

1075
00:56:30.206 --> 00:56:32.459
I did not want
to cause him any harm...

1076
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.295
but he wouldn't listen to me,
and he wouldn't stop.

1077
00:56:41.593 --> 00:56:45.305
These dumb shits been watching
too many old prison movies.

1078
00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.453
You get on the horn.

1079
00:57:08.495 --> 00:57:10.330
Get me a situation red in here.

1080
00:57:11.539 --> 00:57:13.917
Central security,
this is the mess hall.

1081
00:57:13.959 --> 00:57:17.462
We have a situation red.
Repeat, a situation red.

1082
00:57:17.504 --> 00:57:20.131
We've got a situation,
Get down to the mess,

1083
00:57:21.633 --> 00:57:25.553
On the double, all right?
Riot's coming down,

1084
00:57:29.474 --> 00:57:30.725
Hey, Iceman!

1085
00:57:33.186 --> 00:57:35.146
Hey, Iceman.

1086
00:57:35.188 --> 00:57:37.023
Before you came here...

1087
00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:39.651
we all figured
you were some kind of dude.

1088
00:57:39.693 --> 00:57:43.154
Then you show up
actin' like you're the God...

1089
00:57:43.196 --> 00:57:44.656
and we're the sod,

1090
00:57:44.698 --> 00:57:46.658
Well, hey, man,
ever dog in here...

1091
00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.410
wanted to see you
get your ass kicked,

1092
00:57:48.451 --> 00:57:49.995
You're goin' down, man!

1093
00:57:50.036 --> 00:57:51.288
Shit.

1094
00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:12.726
Kick your ass, motherfucker!

1095
00:58:15.895 --> 00:58:17.897
Let's go! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

1096
00:58:27.574 --> 00:58:29.534
Give 'em one!
Take out the ceiling!

1097
00:58:31.536 --> 00:58:33.246
Again!

1098
00:58:48.178 --> 00:58:50.472
He cancelled the fight,

1099
00:58:50.513 --> 00:58:54.559
Jesus fuckin' Christ,
this fuckin' state.

1100
00:58:54.601 --> 00:58:56.811
Who the fuck
does this fuckin' warden...

1101
00:58:56.853 --> 00:58:58.521
fuckin' think he is?

1102
00:58:58.563 --> 00:59:02.525
Doesn't anybody know how to do
business in this fuckin' state?

1103
00:59:02.567 --> 00:59:06.488
My fuckin' wife and her fuckin'
asthma and allergies.

1104
00:59:06.529 --> 00:59:09.115
We had to move
to the fuckin' desert.

1105
00:59:09.157 --> 00:59:11.868
Goddamn fuckin'
chickenshit doctors...

1106
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:14.913
I should've known better than
listen to those shitheels.

1107
00:59:14.955 --> 00:59:17.248
Fuckin' Palm Springs...

1108
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.293
Lay there in the fuckin' sun
and do nothin'.

1109
00:59:20.335 --> 00:59:23.463
Then this fuckin' state
grabs my ass for taxes.

1110
00:59:23.505 --> 00:59:26.591
Why the fuck I didn't stay
in fuckin' Florida...

1111
00:59:26.633 --> 00:59:30.011
where people know how
to do fuckin' business.

1112
00:59:30.046 --> 00:59:33.223
Fuckin' wife
and her fuckin' asthma.

1113
00:59:33.265 --> 00:59:37.352
Shit,

1114
00:59:37.435 --> 00:59:41.856
Somethin' needs
to get fuckin' done...

1115
00:59:41.891 --> 00:59:43.858
I gotta do it myself.

1116
00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:51.032
Call the fuckin' warden.
I wanna meet him.

1117
00:59:52.492 --> 00:59:54.452
Yes, sir, Mr. Ripstein.

1118
01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:11.511
I don't make it a habit
of meeting with prisoners.

1119
01:00:11.553 --> 01:00:13.680
I'm doing this out of deference
to Mr. Mercker here...

1120
01:00:13.722 --> 01:00:15.682
who thought
it'd be a good idea.

1121
01:00:15.724 --> 01:00:19.185
However, any attempt to have me
reinstate the fight...

1122
01:00:19.227 --> 01:00:21.980
between Mr. Chambers and
Monroe Hutchen will be futile.

1123
01:00:22.022 --> 01:00:24.816
It has been
irrevocably cancelled.

1124
01:00:24.858 --> 01:00:28.737
Can I tell you a story?
One of my favorites.

1125
01:00:28.772 --> 01:00:30.780
It's about how things get done.

1126
01:00:30.822 --> 01:00:33.825
This is a story that
takes place in about-

1127
01:00:33.867 --> 01:00:36.244
it must've been
the middle 1950s.

1128
01:00:36.286 --> 01:00:40.373
I was second in charge
of certain operations...

1129
01:00:40.415 --> 01:00:43.919
second to a Mr. Meyer Lansky.

1130
01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.381
There was this casino-
a new one-

1131
01:00:48.423 --> 01:00:51.259
that had been built
in a neighboring town.

1132
01:00:51.301 --> 01:00:57.599
But the mayor, he wanted
to close that casino...

1133
01:00:57.634 --> 01:01:01.519
because he did not
like gambling.

1134
01:01:01.561 --> 01:01:05.565
He thought it brought
the wrong kind of people.

1135
01:01:05.607 --> 01:01:09.110
So he ordered
the casino closed. Ohh.

1136
01:01:10.612 --> 01:01:14.074
I had to report this
to Mr. Lansky.

1137
01:01:14.115 --> 01:01:17.202
So Mr. Lansky,
he told me, he says...

1138
01:01:17.243 --> 01:01:19.204
"You tell that mayor...

1139
01:01:19.245 --> 01:01:23.166
"that the casino stays open,
no question"...

1140
01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:27.093
but that the mayor
had a choice.

1141
01:01:27.128 --> 01:01:34.219
He could choose to be killed,
or he could choose to have...

1142
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:38.473
a great deal of money
deposited in his bank account.

1143
01:01:38.515 --> 01:01:42.394
It was his choice.

1144
01:01:42.435 --> 01:01:47.816
In either case,
the casino stays open.

1145
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:51.152
What happened to the mayor?

1146
01:01:51.187 --> 01:01:52.445
He died,

1147
01:01:52.487 --> 01:01:58.785
He hit his ignition and his car
exploded like a fireball.

1148
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.123
You're gonna stand there and
let this hoodlum threaten me?

1149
01:02:03.164 --> 01:02:08.336
Well, sir, I don't much
want my car to blow up.

1150
01:02:08.378 --> 01:02:10.380
We could
talk about the money...

1151
01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:13.237
when you come back
from your vacation.

1152
01:02:13.272 --> 01:02:16.052
I understand
you're leaving tomorrow?

1153
01:02:16.094 --> 01:02:19.055
All of us, we hope
you and your family...

1154
01:02:19.097 --> 01:02:21.391
have a very pleasant time.

1155
01:02:44.706 --> 01:02:46.416
Time!

1156
01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:49.002
We're gonna limo over
a few guys from Vegas-

1157
01:02:49.044 --> 01:02:51.087
act as witnesses.

1158
01:02:51.129 --> 01:02:54.132
Chuy, we've been talkin'.

1159
01:02:54.174 --> 01:02:56.301
We need you
to go to the Iceman.

1160
01:02:56.343 --> 01:02:57.517
Get a number.

1161
01:02:57.552 --> 01:02:59.721
We're gettin' a hell
of a price on Monroe.

1162
01:02:59.763 --> 01:03:01.973
We need the Iceman
to go for it.

1163
01:03:02.015 --> 01:03:05.310
Ask him to lie down?
I don't see it.

1164
01:03:05.352 --> 01:03:06.853
Offer him a million.

1165
01:03:06.895 --> 01:03:09.522
He made $25 million the last
time he fought somebody.

1166
01:03:09.564 --> 01:03:12.192
- He had to fight for that one.
- Talk to him.

1167
01:03:12.233 --> 01:03:13.568
You got it wrong.

1168
01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:15.612
You hired me
to look after Mendy.

1169
01:03:15.654 --> 01:03:17.530
I'm looking after him
right now.

1170
01:03:17.572 --> 01:03:19.491
Mendy wants a straight fight.
It's not the money.

1171
01:03:19.532 --> 01:03:22.744
Bullshit! In New York,
in Cuba, in Florida...

1172
01:03:22.786 --> 01:03:25.580
his whole life,
it's always about the money.

1173
01:03:25.622 --> 01:03:27.582
He's got it stashed
all over the place.

1174
01:03:27.624 --> 01:03:29.209
Fuckin' millions.

1175
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:31.670
He's got ever fuckin'
nickel he ever made.

1176
01:03:31.711 --> 01:03:34.005
With Mendy,
it's always about the money.

1177
01:03:34.047 --> 01:03:36.216
You guys are way off
Mendy's radar on this deal...

1178
01:03:36.258 --> 01:03:37.926
and I don't want
to mess it up for him.

1179
01:03:37.968 --> 01:03:40.804
Mendy wants a straight fight
to the finish, and that's it.

1180
01:03:40.845 --> 01:03:43.640
You want the Iceman to dump?
You go talk to him.

1181
01:03:43.682 --> 01:03:45.725
But don't get your hopes up.

1182
01:03:50.063 --> 01:03:53.316
OK, Monroe, now that
this thing is back on...

1183
01:03:53.358 --> 01:03:56.236
here's the deal.
We got a guy in the dispensary.

1184
01:03:56.278 --> 01:04:00.031
He's gonna steal five or ten
Valiums, crush 'em up.

1185
01:04:00.073 --> 01:04:02.909
And I got another guy
in the commissar.

1186
01:04:02.951 --> 01:04:06.413
Last meal Iceman eats before
he fights, we mix it in.

1187
01:04:06.454 --> 01:04:10.333
Just enough to slow him down,
fuck him up.

1188
01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:14.462
Now, he'll still fight,
but he won't be the same.

1189
01:04:14.504 --> 01:04:16.756
That'll be just enough
to give you the edge.

1190
01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:18.258
You got it?

1191
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.513
You do that, I'm gonna
break you up into pieces.

1192
01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:28.393
I can take this guy,
and I don't need no help.

1193
01:04:28.435 --> 01:04:30.610
You understand that?

1194
01:04:30.645 --> 01:04:32.689
Hey! We're just trying
to give you...

1195
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:34.357
a little something extra, man.

1196
01:04:34.399 --> 01:04:36.276
We got a lot of money
on this table.

1197
01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:46.786
I may not be a real good guy...

1198
01:04:46.828 --> 01:04:53.084
but I ain't no chickenshit,
either. You remember that.

1199
01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.088
Take him down.

1200
01:05:31.247 --> 01:05:35.585
OK. We got ourselves
ninety minutes.

1201
01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:39.464
We just concentrate. We focus.

1202
01:05:39.506 --> 01:05:42.634
We mentally imagine
ourselves winning.

1203
01:05:42.676 --> 01:05:47.597
Just close your eyes.
We concentrate.

1204
01:05:47.639 --> 01:05:50.100
We see ourselves winning.

1205
01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:53.144
We see Iceman all beat to shit.

1206
01:05:53.186 --> 01:05:55.522
We see ourselves winning.

1207
01:05:59.609 --> 01:06:02.195
In twenty minutes,
we star to loosen up, OK?

1208
01:06:02.237 --> 01:06:03.536
Break a sweat.

1209
01:06:03.571 --> 01:06:06.825
We don't want this shithead
to catch you cold.

1210
01:06:06.866 --> 01:06:10.662
Hey, you get sloppy,
that's when mistakes happen.

1211
01:06:17.335 --> 01:06:20.880
All right,
cell blocks A, B, C, and D...

1212
01:06:20.922 --> 01:06:22.924
if all y'all
are ready over there...

1213
01:06:22.966 --> 01:06:26.303
let's star movin' em in
on fifteen-minute intervals.

1214
01:06:37.772 --> 01:06:39.816
Let's get
the fighters in here!

1215
01:06:44.487 --> 01:06:47.574
Tear it up, Monroe, tear it up!
Yeah.

1216
01:06:47.616 --> 01:06:51.077
He's shit! Iceman is shit!
He is shit! Yeah.

1217
01:06:52.287 --> 01:06:55.916
That's it, that's it!
That's my man! Go!

1218
01:06:55.957 --> 01:06:57.918
Go ahead, now!

1219
01:06:57.959 --> 01:07:00.670
Yeah, let it go,
let it go, let it go!

1220
01:07:18.688 --> 01:07:22.651
And now,
Sweetwater's the Gat Boyz...

1221
01:07:22.686 --> 01:07:25.987
will sing the national anthem!

1222
01:07:30.492 --> 01:07:38.625
# Oh, say can you see #

1223
01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:46.925
# By the dawn's early light #

1224
01:07:46.967 --> 01:07:54.557
# What so proudly
we hail'd... #

1225
01:07:54.599 --> 01:07:56.726
You're livin'. You're hot.

1226
01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:58.603
Just listen to 'em. Yeah.

1227
01:07:58.645 --> 01:08:01.564
He is a guest,
and this is your house!

1228
01:08:01.606 --> 01:08:03.316
He is an unwelcome guest.

1229
01:08:03.358 --> 01:08:07.737
# Ever inmate wanna be free #

1230
01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:11.574
# Ever hustler wanna be me #

1231
01:08:17.998 --> 01:08:19.207
Go ahead, baby!

1232
01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:21.835
Yeah, let it go! Let it go!

1233
01:08:21.876 --> 01:08:25.630
# O'er the land
of the free... #

1234
01:08:25.672 --> 01:08:28.592
He don't look good.
He's ugly.

1235
01:08:28.633 --> 01:08:34.764
# And the home of the brave #

1236
01:08:45.150 --> 01:08:48.034
It's time! It's time!

1237
01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:50.655
Fighters to the ring!
Fighters to the ring!

1238
01:08:50.697 --> 01:08:54.367
Fight's on! Fight's on!

1239
01:09:05.921 --> 01:09:08.673
# Now the time has come #

1240
01:09:08.715 --> 01:09:09.966
# Time #

1241
01:09:10.008 --> 01:09:11.551
# No place to run #

1242
01:09:13.261 --> 01:09:15.889
# Might get burned up
by the sun #

1243
01:09:15.931 --> 01:09:17.057
# Time #

1244
01:09:17.098 --> 01:09:19.684
# But I'll have my fun #

1245
01:09:19.726 --> 01:09:23.772
Good evening, honored guests,
scumbags, and Mr. Mercker...

1246
01:09:23.813 --> 01:09:26.191
the time is now!

1247
01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:30.236
We got a first here,
my friends...

1248
01:09:30.278 --> 01:09:33.657
courtesy of a great man,
whose name I cannot say.

1249
01:09:33.698 --> 01:09:36.117
Fight fans all over the world
are gonna be wishin'...

1250
01:09:36.152 --> 01:09:38.078
they's in the bottom
of the barrel with us...

1251
01:09:38.119 --> 01:09:42.040
wishin' Sweetwater Prison
was their home tonight!

1252
01:09:44.459 --> 01:09:46.044
Now pay close attention...

1253
01:09:46.086 --> 01:09:48.088
'cause I'm only
gonna say this once.

1254
01:09:48.129 --> 01:09:50.257
The fight you're about to see
follows a set of rules...

1255
01:09:50.298 --> 01:09:52.217
never been used before
around here.

1256
01:09:52.259 --> 01:09:53.510
London Prize Rules:

1257
01:09:53.551 --> 01:09:55.553
no traditional rounds
to speak of...

1258
01:09:55.595 --> 01:09:57.222
no regulation-size gloves...

1259
01:09:57.264 --> 01:09:59.870
just those bitty six-ounce
suckers gonna tear up.

1260
01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:02.442
A fighter steps from
the mark ready to fight.

1261
01:10:02.477 --> 01:10:05.272
He go down, then he got
sixty seconds to come back.

1262
01:10:05.313 --> 01:10:08.191
That's it!
Fight to the finish! No ref!

1263
01:10:08.233 --> 01:10:10.485
All we got is the timekeeper
for the mark!

1264
01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:13.154
Our very own Mr. Mercker,
the walkin' boss.

1265
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:16.825
Now put your hands together,
my friends...

1266
01:10:16.866 --> 01:10:18.743
for our favorite son...

1267
01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:21.162
Sweetwater's
defending champion...

1268
01:10:21.204 --> 01:10:23.123
undefeated,
with a prison record...

1269
01:10:23.164 --> 01:10:28.169
of 68 wins, no losses,
weighing in at 199 pounds...

1270
01:10:28.211 --> 01:10:30.422
wearing the burgundy trunks
with the black trim...

1271
01:10:30.463 --> 01:10:33.508
Monroe... Monroe...

1272
01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:36.553
Monroe Hutchen!

1273
01:10:36.595 --> 01:10:39.097
Monroe Hutchen!
Monroe Hutchen!

1274
01:10:40.557 --> 01:10:42.392
Now give it up
for the west corner.

1275
01:10:42.434 --> 01:10:45.645
He's also undefeated...
on the outside.

1276
01:10:45.687 --> 01:10:47.230
Weighing in at 205...

1277
01:10:47.272 --> 01:10:50.483
the former heavyweight
champion of the world...

1278
01:10:50.525 --> 01:10:53.486
George "Iceman" Chambers!

1279
01:10:53.528 --> 01:10:54.738
Come on, motherfucker!

1280
01:10:54.779 --> 01:10:57.365
There's only
one thing I got to say-

1281
01:10:57.407 --> 01:10:59.117
put his ass
between his shoulders!

1282
01:10:59.159 --> 01:11:01.661
OK, brother cons,
we are ready!

1283
01:11:01.703 --> 01:11:03.913
Now, don't let your passion
for the great Monroe...

1284
01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:07.500
interfere with good judgment,
and don't do nothin' stupid!

1285
01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:09.002
That'll forfeit
all the money...

1286
01:11:09.044 --> 01:11:10.670
that you guys bet
at those big odds.

1287
01:11:10.712 --> 01:11:13.381
And welcome to our amigos
from Las Vegas...

1288
01:11:13.423 --> 01:11:15.592
here to witness this contest
and report it...

1289
01:11:15.634 --> 01:11:17.677
to various cities
all around our great country,

1290
01:11:17.719 --> 01:11:19.429
Whole lotta bookmakers
out there want to know...

1291
01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:20.805
what's comin' down.

1292
01:11:20.847 --> 01:11:23.141
Well, it's us against
the world, my brothers,

1293
01:11:23.183 --> 01:11:26.519
And just like you, I too am
for the great Monroe Hutchen!

1294
01:11:26.561 --> 01:11:28.647
He brought honor
to our house of pain...

1295
01:11:28.688 --> 01:11:30.440
but I will call
a neutral fight.

1296
01:11:30.482 --> 01:11:32.317
Come on, bitch.

1297
01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:34.110
This is the fight
for what's right,

1298
01:11:34.152 --> 01:11:35.654
This is the brawl for it all!

1299
01:11:35.695 --> 01:11:36.863
This fight ain't about money!

1300
01:11:36.905 --> 01:11:38.573
This is their
heavyweight champion...

1301
01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:40.241
against our
heavyweight champion!

1302
01:11:40.283 --> 01:11:44.245
This fight is for respeck!
R- e-s-p-e-c-k!

1303
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.455
Respeck!

1304
01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:49.918
Round one! Round one!

1305
01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.047
And here we go, baby.

1306
01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.884
They move
to the center of the ring...

1307
01:11:57.926 --> 01:11:59.678
feelin' each other out,

1308
01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:06.434
You gotta remember something:

1309
01:12:06.476 --> 01:12:08.436
Monroe is
a forty-to-one underdog...

1310
01:12:08.478 --> 01:12:10.814
goin' up against the Iceman,
a great champion,

1311
01:12:13.275 --> 01:12:16.820
Combinations, man!
Combinations!

1312
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:19.030
Monroe swings and misses,
Iceman counters...

1313
01:12:19.072 --> 01:12:20.407
with a hard right hand
to the head!

1314
01:12:20.448 --> 01:12:23.535
- That's it, baby, come on!
- Hit that big motherfucker!

1315
01:12:24.953 --> 01:12:27.254
Monroe's
backpedaling, circling,

1316
01:12:27.289 --> 01:12:28.665
Doesn't look
like he's too willing...

1317
01:12:28.707 --> 01:12:32.419
to trade punches
with the Iceman,

1318
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.005
Watch it, Monroe,
watch it, now, baby!

1319
01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:40.885
Lookin' for a way
to get to Monroe,

1320
01:12:40.927 --> 01:12:43.179
Now he's tauntin' him!
He's tauntin' Monroe!

1321
01:12:43.221 --> 01:12:45.265
He's taunting him!
Monroe swings,

1322
01:12:45.307 --> 01:12:47.058
The Iceman hits him
with a hard right...

1323
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.393
and a left to Monroe's head!

1324
01:12:48.435 --> 01:12:50.395
You ain't hurt him!
You ain't hurt him!

1325
01:12:50.437 --> 01:12:52.105
Hey, bullshit!

1326
01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.941
Oh, Monroe misses...

1327
01:12:54.983 --> 01:12:56.693
and the Iceman tags him
with a hard left hand...

1328
01:12:56.735 --> 01:12:58.653
and Monroe
is going backwards, baby,

1329
01:12:58.695 --> 01:13:00.697
The Iceman tauntin' him on,

1330
01:13:03.658 --> 01:13:05.118
Get in his face!
Get in his face!

1331
01:13:08.496 --> 01:13:11.708
Monroe lands an overhand right!
Now a combination!

1332
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:14.968
Monroe's getting himself
into this fight!

1333
01:13:15.003 --> 01:13:17.088
The Iceman counters with
a hard right to the face,

1334
01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:18.381
Another right to the head,

1335
01:13:19.841 --> 01:13:22.594
Monroe is fast, but the Iceman
is much stronger,

1336
01:13:22.636 --> 01:13:26.014
They hook up again! Both men
exchanging combinations!

1337
01:13:26.049 --> 01:13:29.267
Right hand!
Left! Right! Right!

1338
01:13:29.309 --> 01:13:33.188
And boom!
The Iceman drives Monroe back!

1339
01:13:36.316 --> 01:13:38.818
Make him bleed, man,
make him bleed!

1340
01:13:42.197 --> 01:13:44.324
Both men throw combinations!

1341
01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:47.035
Left! Right! Overhand right!

1342
01:13:48.536 --> 01:13:51.164
Monroe misses,
The Iceman comes back...

1343
01:13:51.206 --> 01:13:52.999
with a right-left to the head!

1344
01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:54.960
Get him!

1345
01:13:55.001 --> 01:13:57.295
They're fighting
at an incredible pace!

1346
01:13:57.337 --> 01:13:59.839
Can you believe it?

1347
01:14:00.924 --> 01:14:02.849
Nice overhand right
by Monroe!

1348
01:14:02.884 --> 01:14:06.554
Iceman's not hurt, but he
ties Monroe up in a clinch!

1349
01:14:08.974 --> 01:14:10.976
Oh, shit, baby! Go get him!

1350
01:14:13.561 --> 01:14:14.938
Hard right hand!

1351
01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.690
Yeah! Another one! Move!

1352
01:14:16.731 --> 01:14:18.316
Monroe swings and misses...

1353
01:14:18.358 --> 01:14:20.151
and the Iceman
keeps hurting' him...

1354
01:14:20.193 --> 01:14:22.362
with an overhand right,

1355
01:14:22.404 --> 01:14:24.656
Combination, right-left!

1356
01:14:24.698 --> 01:14:26.533
Big left hook!

1357
01:14:26.574 --> 01:14:29.160
A right and a left
to the stomach,

1358
01:14:29.202 --> 01:14:31.204
Another left-
oh, an uppercut!

1359
01:14:31.246 --> 01:14:32.872
And Monroe is down!

1360
01:14:32.914 --> 01:14:34.374
Sixty seconds!

1361
01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:37.335
And we now know why
he's the heavyweight champion...

1362
01:14:37.377 --> 01:14:39.045
of the world.

1363
01:14:39.087 --> 01:14:41.881
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1364
01:14:41.923 --> 01:14:44.009
Huh? What? What?

1365
01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:45.892
And Monroe is up!

1366
01:14:45.927 --> 01:14:48.263
Looks like he will continue,

1367
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:51.850
Hey, Iceman, you ain't shit!

1368
01:14:51.891 --> 01:14:53.852
You just got robbed!

1369
01:14:53.893 --> 01:14:55.854
The Iceman's straight-ahead,
locomotive style...

1370
01:14:55.895 --> 01:14:57.689
may be a little too much
for Monroe,

1371
01:14:57.731 --> 01:15:00.191
He's never had to face
anything like this,

1372
01:15:00.233 --> 01:15:02.152
- Boo!
- Fuck!

1373
01:15:02.193 --> 01:15:04.988
- Boo!
- Come on, big daddy!

1374
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:06.781
The Iceman's in his corner...

1375
01:15:06.823 --> 01:15:08.158
a mighty confident man,

1376
01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:10.410
That's what you gotta do!
Let's go!

1377
01:15:10.452 --> 01:15:12.829
Monroe's trademark of
occasionally switching...

1378
01:15:12.871 --> 01:15:14.581
to a southpaw
left-hand style-

1379
01:15:14.623 --> 01:15:16.207
ain't workin' so far, baby!

1380
01:15:16.249 --> 01:15:17.959
Ten seconds!
Fighters to the line!

1381
01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:20.378
Fighters to the line!
Clear the ring!

1382
01:15:21.671 --> 01:15:23.214
Pucker up, motherfucker.

1383
01:15:23.256 --> 01:15:24.466
Clear the ring!

1384
01:15:26.217 --> 01:15:28.637
Round Two!

1385
01:15:29.721 --> 01:15:31.264
And here we go, baby!

1386
01:15:31.306 --> 01:15:33.058
Despite the knockdown,
Monroe looks...

1387
01:15:33.099 --> 01:15:35.894
like he's pulled himself
back together,

1388
01:15:42.609 --> 01:15:44.444
The Iceman misses...

1389
01:15:44.486 --> 01:15:46.696
and Monroe lands
an overhand right!

1390
01:15:50.116 --> 01:15:52.202
Right hand! Right hand!

1391
01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:54.454
A quick-hit exchange!

1392
01:15:54.496 --> 01:15:56.790
Now this is boxing!
Hard combinations...

1393
01:15:56.831 --> 01:15:59.584
and they clinch!
Beautiful! Beautiful!

1394
01:16:03.964 --> 01:16:06.174
Ooh, what a right hand
by the Iceman!

1395
01:16:06.216 --> 01:16:08.843
Another right to the head,
Monroe misses...

1396
01:16:08.885 --> 01:16:10.804
and pays for it dearly
to the body...

1397
01:16:10.845 --> 01:16:12.305
and he reels back
from the punishment...

1398
01:16:12.347 --> 01:16:13.807
given to him by the Iceman,

1399
01:16:13.848 --> 01:16:16.434
Another hard right and left,
and Monroe is on his heels!

1400
01:16:16.476 --> 01:16:17.769
He's up against the fence!

1401
01:16:17.811 --> 01:16:19.479
The Iceman
is going for the body!

1402
01:16:19.521 --> 01:16:21.356
Another one to the body,
and it doesn't look good...

1403
01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:23.275
for Sweetwater’s
own favorite son,

1404
01:16:23.316 --> 01:16:26.695
The Iceman's all over him!
He's tearin' Monroe up!

1405
01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:28.655
Oh, another right
to the head!

1406
01:16:28.697 --> 01:16:32.158
Monroe's down, and he's dizzy
as a motherfucker!

1407
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.287
He's talkin' shit, baby!
He's talkin' shit!

1408
01:16:35.328 --> 01:16:37.163
Who the hell you think-
I know he ain't talkin' to me,

1409
01:16:37.205 --> 01:16:38.331
He's talkin' to y'all!

1410
01:16:38.373 --> 01:16:41.001
That's right! Yeah! Uh-huh!

1411
01:16:41.042 --> 01:16:43.712
Monroe's wobbly, He's shaky,

1412
01:16:43.753 --> 01:16:46.506
There's no question about it,
Monroe is hurt!

1413
01:16:46.548 --> 01:16:48.008
Come on! Come on!

1414
01:16:48.049 --> 01:16:51.428
Don't get careless.
Knock him on his ass!

1415
01:16:51.469 --> 01:16:53.722
Now take a whiff of this.
Come on.

1416
01:16:53.757 --> 01:16:55.522
This fight is far from over.

1417
01:16:55.557 --> 01:16:57.475
You're gonna get him.
We got plenty of time.

1418
01:16:57.517 --> 01:17:00.186
He just loves
to taunt the crowd,

1419
01:17:00.228 --> 01:17:02.314
He's got everything
going his way,

1420
01:17:02.355 --> 01:17:05.025
Oh, that Iceman is
one cocky son of a bitch,

1421
01:17:05.066 --> 01:17:07.819
He's already knocked
him down twice, Eddie!

1422
01:17:07.861 --> 01:17:09.779
I don't know how much longer
this has got to go.

1423
01:17:09.821 --> 01:17:11.281
You gotta fight your fight!

1424
01:17:11.323 --> 01:17:13.658
You're fightin' his fight.
You control the rhythm.

1425
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.889
You gotta
turn this fight around!

1426
01:17:15.924 --> 01:17:18.079
You can do it, Monroe!
Come on, now!

1427
01:17:18.121 --> 01:17:19.456
This is your round!

1428
01:17:19.497 --> 01:17:21.750
The Iceman lookin'
supremely confident,

1429
01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:23.460
He's got it all goin' his way!

1430
01:17:23.501 --> 01:17:26.046
Round three!

1431
01:17:29.257 --> 01:17:31.051
They come out,
and it seems like the Iceman...

1432
01:17:31.092 --> 01:17:33.053
is just trin'
to find that one big shot...

1433
01:17:33.094 --> 01:17:34.846
that'll put Monroe
on his ass...

1434
01:17:34.888 --> 01:17:36.556
and give him a one-way
ticket to Bootyville.

1435
01:17:39.267 --> 01:17:41.895
Oh! A big right hand
by the Iceman!

1436
01:17:43.438 --> 01:17:45.982
And another right hand
by the Iceman!

1437
01:17:46.024 --> 01:17:47.984
This can't go much furher!

1438
01:17:48.026 --> 01:17:49.486
That's it! That's it!

1439
01:17:49.527 --> 01:17:51.571
Come on, Mo! Dance with him!

1440
01:17:51.613 --> 01:17:54.282
Both of these men
are great warriors,

1441
01:17:54.324 --> 01:17:56.576
Iceman has a look
of determination in his eye-

1442
01:17:56.611 --> 01:17:58.828
but like I said before,
brother scumbags...

1443
01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:02.749
he's lookin' for that big punch
to end it all for Monroe,

1444
01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.837
The Iceman is clearly
in control of this fight,

1445
01:18:07.879 --> 01:18:09.381
But Monroe
is still there, baby.

1446
01:18:09.422 --> 01:18:11.508
Our favorite son
is still standin',

1447
01:18:15.387 --> 01:18:17.639
Oh, that right hand just
keeps shakin' Monroe up!

1448
01:18:17.674 --> 01:18:19.641
Stay strong! Stay strong!

1449
01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:26.106
Big left and right
comin' from the Iceman!

1450
01:18:26.147 --> 01:18:28.275
He is all over Monroe!

1451
01:18:28.316 --> 01:18:30.068
And the Iceman is on the hunt!

1452
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:31.451
He's on the prowl!

1453
01:18:31.486 --> 01:18:33.530
He's goin' in for the kill!

1454
01:18:35.323 --> 01:18:38.118
Oh, God!

1455
01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:40.870
What a devastating
left hook from Monroe!

1456
01:18:40.912 --> 01:18:42.956
The Iceman is staggering,
and he's hurt!

1457
01:18:46.001 --> 01:18:48.128
Oh, Monroe hits him
with another shot!

1458
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:50.589
He's drivin' him
back up against the cage...

1459
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:52.257
punishing him
with wicked combinations!

1460
01:18:52.299 --> 01:18:53.883
Monroe is all over him!

1461
01:18:58.305 --> 01:19:00.765
He's hurt! He's hurt!
Left, and right!

1462
01:19:00.807 --> 01:19:02.100
Oh, shit.

1463
01:19:02.142 --> 01:19:04.144
Can you believe it?!

1464
01:19:04.185 --> 01:19:06.771
Ohh! And a right hand
puts the Iceman down!

1465
01:19:06.813 --> 01:19:08.607
The Iceman is down...

1466
01:19:08.648 --> 01:19:10.275
for the first time
in his career!

1467
01:19:10.317 --> 01:19:11.568
Sixty seconds!

1468
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:13.069
Shit!

1469
01:19:13.111 --> 01:19:14.988
This is unbelievable,

1470
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:16.329
Unbelievable!

1471
01:19:16.364 --> 01:19:17.782
Way to go, Monroe!

1472
01:19:17.824 --> 01:19:19.576
I can't believe it!
The Iceman is down!

1473
01:19:19.618 --> 01:19:23.496
And the Iceman is up,
He's staggerin' around,

1474
01:19:23.538 --> 01:19:25.790
He doesn't know where he is,

1475
01:19:25.832 --> 01:19:28.710
Oh, my God, he's gone
plum-fuckin'- crazy in there!

1476
01:19:28.752 --> 01:19:31.004
The Iceman's gone
absolutely crazy,

1477
01:19:31.046 --> 01:19:33.381
This could be it, This could be
a disqualification,

1478
01:19:33.416 --> 01:19:35.651
Somebody get in there
and stop this thing!

1479
01:19:35.686 --> 01:19:37.886
I got a lotta damn money
ridin' on this!

1480
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:47.437
Pandemonium! Out of control!

1481
01:19:48.897 --> 01:19:51.524
Monroe has definitely
turned this fight around,

1482
01:19:53.902 --> 01:19:56.529
What goes on in the mind
of George "Iceman" Chambers...

1483
01:19:56.571 --> 01:19:58.448
at this moment
is anybody's guess,

1484
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:00.533
This is one
for the record books, baby,

1485
01:20:00.575 --> 01:20:01.910
People are gonna be talking
about this...

1486
01:20:01.945 --> 01:20:03.491
for the rest of their life,
and if I knew...

1487
01:20:03.526 --> 01:20:05.038
I had to go to jail
to see a fight like this...

1488
01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.790
I'd have did a crime
a long time ago!

1489
01:20:06.831 --> 01:20:09.167
This is your night!
This is your house, baby!

1490
01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:11.836
Don't let up! Go at him!
Stick him hard!

1491
01:20:11.878 --> 01:20:14.721
Take him out, baby! Come on!

1492
01:20:14.756 --> 01:20:16.883
Ten seconds!
Fighters to the line!

1493
01:20:16.925 --> 01:20:20.262
You can do it!
Kick his ass!

1494
01:20:20.303 --> 01:20:22.472
Let's go, Monroe, let's go!

1495
01:20:23.765 --> 01:20:25.392
That was
the toughest round...

1496
01:20:25.433 --> 01:20:26.893
in the Iceman's whole career,

1497
01:20:26.935 --> 01:20:29.896
He must regain momentum,
He must come out strong,

1498
01:20:29.938 --> 01:20:31.898
He must get back
in this fight!

1499
01:20:33.858 --> 01:20:37.028
Oh! And he is back!
A left and a right to Monroe!

1500
01:20:40.699 --> 01:20:43.410
Monroe hits him with
a right hand, left hand...

1501
01:20:43.451 --> 01:20:44.751
and another right hand...

1502
01:20:44.786 --> 01:20:46.871
and the Iceman
is forced to clinch!

1503
01:20:46.913 --> 01:20:48.915
Stick him, baby! Go at him now!

1504
01:20:50.959 --> 01:20:53.545
Monroe switches to southpaw!

1505
01:20:58.174 --> 01:21:00.594
They're hookin' up!
Toe to toe!

1506
01:21:00.635 --> 01:21:02.596
Punch for punch!
Back and forth!

1507
01:21:02.637 --> 01:21:04.764
This is a war!

1508
01:21:06.933 --> 01:21:09.936
Oh, my god, what a fight!
And I am so happy...

1509
01:21:09.978 --> 01:21:12.856
that it's happenin' right here
at Sweetwater Prison,

1510
01:21:12.897 --> 01:21:14.107
Let's go, baby!

1511
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:17.360
He's on the hunt!
Monroe's on the prowl!

1512
01:21:17.402 --> 01:21:19.738
Right hand!
A left to the stomach!

1513
01:21:19.779 --> 01:21:21.197
Overhand right!

1514
01:21:21.239 --> 01:21:23.366
Another left and a right,
and an overhand right...

1515
01:21:23.408 --> 01:21:24.868
to the head!

1516
01:21:26.244 --> 01:21:28.246
Monroe is punishing him...

1517
01:21:28.288 --> 01:21:30.130
with blows to the head
and the body,

1518
01:21:30.165 --> 01:21:33.168
Say what you want to say about
George "Iceman" Chambers...

1519
01:21:33.203 --> 01:21:35.211
but he is dead game!

1520
01:22:12.123 --> 01:22:14.341
It's over! It's over!

1521
01:22:14.376 --> 01:22:17.045
Monroe wins again! It's over!

1522
01:22:17.087 --> 01:22:18.296
It's over!

1523
01:22:18.338 --> 01:22:20.507
That's it! Monroe wins...

1524
01:22:20.548 --> 01:22:24.010
and I just won
a lot of goddamn money!

1525
01:22:25.136 --> 01:22:26.763
Yeah! Yeah!

1526
01:22:26.805 --> 01:22:29.140
You owe me money, Eddie!
You owe me money!

1527
01:22:29.182 --> 01:22:32.102
Monroe! Monroe!

1528
01:22:33.561 --> 01:22:35.563
Yeah! Yeah!

1529
01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:57.294
Monroe! Yeah!

1530
01:23:31.411 --> 01:23:35.832
But this...
this is a thing of beauty.

1531
01:23:35.867 --> 01:23:38.800
A great thing of beauty.

1532
01:23:38.835 --> 01:23:41.254
Two guys
fightin' to the finish...

1533
01:23:41.296 --> 01:23:44.966
but just one guy wins
because he's the better man...

1534
01:23:45.001 --> 01:23:48.428
and that's what
the goddamn sport is about.

1535
01:23:58.355 --> 01:24:01.816
Mendy Ripstein died
3 weeks after the big fight,

1536
01:24:01.858 --> 01:24:04.548
He kept his word,
Monroe got his money...

1537
01:24:04.583 --> 01:24:07.238
and the Iceman got out
on special parole,

1538
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.240
I can personally
thank Mr. Ripstein...

1539
01:24:09.282 --> 01:24:10.825
for another thing,

1540
01:24:10.867 --> 01:24:13.662
His lawyers
contacted my family,

1541
01:24:13.703 --> 01:24:16.748
He left me $2 million,
free and clear,

1542
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:19.209
So I guess I'm not
gonna have any excuses...

1543
01:24:19.251 --> 01:24:21.586
when I get out of here,

1544
01:24:21.628 --> 01:24:24.464
I read in the sports page
that Iceman and his manager...

1545
01:24:24.506 --> 01:24:27.175
both denied the fight
with Monroe ever happened...

1546
01:24:27.217 --> 01:24:30.762
and the story about him losing
was only a big rumor...

1547
01:24:30.804 --> 01:24:32.347
a fairy tale,

1548
01:24:32.389 --> 01:24:34.557
Once upon a time in prison,

1549
01:24:39.771 --> 01:24:41.439
Our panel of experts...

1550
01:24:41.481 --> 01:24:44.025
have the fight even
at two rounds apiece,

1551
01:24:44.067 --> 01:24:45.485
Both fighters fighting...

1552
01:24:45.527 --> 01:24:47.946
for the heavyweight
championship of the world...

1553
01:24:47.988 --> 01:24:51.032
the greatest title
in all of sports,

1554
01:24:51.074 --> 01:24:53.285
One thing I can tell you
for sure...

1555
01:24:53.326 --> 01:24:57.247
life in prison hasn't changed
the Iceman's fighting style,

1556
01:24:57.289 --> 01:24:59.583
Both fighters feeling
each other out now,

1557
01:24:59.618 --> 01:25:01.209
Briscoe trying
to work the jab,

1558
01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:02.794
He can't get anything in,

1559
01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:10.885
A left to the body!
And here comes Chambers!

1560
01:25:10.927 --> 01:25:12.512
Another right!
A left to the body!

1561
01:25:12.554 --> 01:25:14.723
Right-left combination!
A left! A right!

1562
01:25:14.764 --> 01:25:17.058
A left hook,
and down goes Briscoe!

1563
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.019
Down goes Briscoe!

1564
01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.062
Chambers over
to the neutral corner...

1565
01:25:21.104 --> 01:25:23.732
and referee Mathew Kerrigan
is counting it out!

1566
01:25:23.773 --> 01:25:26.484
Briscoe, desperately trying
to stand up,

1567
01:25:26.526 --> 01:25:27.736
He wants to continue,

1568
01:25:28.987 --> 01:25:31.698
Kerrigan has called it off!

1569
01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.158
And by knockout...

1570
01:25:33.199 --> 01:25:35.744
with one minute, 22 seconds
into the fifth round...

1571
01:25:35.785 --> 01:25:37.913
Right here!
Always was the champ!

1572
01:25:37.954 --> 01:25:40.290
...Briscoe is knocked out,
and the now-undisputed...

1573
01:25:40.325 --> 01:25:42.125
heavyweight champion
of the world...

1574
01:25:42.167 --> 01:25:45.754
is George "Iceman" Chambers!

1575
01:25:48.924 --> 01:25:52.802
Hey, Monroe! Iceman won!

1576
01:25:52.837 --> 01:25:54.471
Guess what, cat?

1577
01:25:54.512 --> 01:25:58.016
They say he's the heavyweight
champ of the whole world!

1578
01:25:58.058 --> 01:26:01.311
Undisputed! Haaaa!

1579
01:26:01.353 --> 01:26:02.938
Monroe!

1580
01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:08.878
# Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

1581
01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.717
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

1582
01:27:13.752 --> 01:27:15.468

# And I'm Holly Grove's hear,

1592

# And I'm Momma's oldest boy,

# But Papa's not real,

1595

# I'm nineteen strong,
