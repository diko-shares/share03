{3370}{3437}won the title. 1937.
{3438}{3484}Louis hits him|with a left and a right!
{3485}{3517}And Braddock is down!
{3518}{3572}Straight right hand to the jaw.
{3573}{3629}Christ, they could've|counted to fifty.
{3630}{3689}He was the best heavyweight...
{3690}{3740}that ever fought|under the modern rules.
{3741}{3793}No discussion, the best.
{3794}{3899}Then the fucking government|chased him about taxes.
{3900}{4017}Fucking IRS,|fucking bureaucrat assholes.
{4075}{4109}Fuck it.

{6172}{6221}wearing the burgundy trunks|with the black trim...
{6222}{6349}Sweetwater's own,|Monroe Hutchen!
{6819}{6890}All right now, shit birds,|y'all both know the rules.
{6891}{6961}I want a nice, clean fight,|nothing below the belt.
{6962}{7028}You understand me? Let's box.
{7175}{7217}Now remember,|brother convicts,,,
{7218}{7250}if you learned how to act...
{7251}{7287}they wouldn't have to fight|inside of a cage.
{7288}{7321}And be on your|best behavior, too...
{7322}{7364}'cause we don't want|no incidents, all right?
{7365}{7397}Now, let's see what|the pride of Loda...
{7398}{7441}has to offer against|the great Monroe.
{7442}{7491}Give Hitler's cousin|his lunch, baby.
{7492}{7549}It's all you, baby!|It's all you!
{7550}{7588}Yeah! Come on now!
{7589}{7634}Come back|from the rail--get back,
{7726}{7782}And there go the bell.|Here we go.
{7783}{7847}Monroe comes out|and peppers him,,,
{7848}{7887}with a nice left hand,
{7888}{7924}And another left hand,
{7989}{8019}Monroe's|just feeling him out,,,
{8020}{8065}popping him with|a little left hand,
{8066}{8113}He going to shine that|bald head up, for sure,
{8114}{8187}Move your feet!|Oh, yeah, that's right!
{8188}{8231}Yeah! Yeah!
{8232}{8274}Beat the teeth out of|his mouth, Monroe!
{8275}{8304}Come on, man!
{8421}{8493}A left|and a right by Monroe!
{8494}{8554}This guy hasn't|tagged Monroe yet,
{8555}{8615}How in the hell|could you be 6-6, 280,,,
{8616}{8664}and look wobbly already? Ooh!
{8665}{8725}He's down! He's down!
{8726}{8800}He's already down!|Vern Van Zant is down!
{8834}{8874}We're not even halfway|through the first round,,,
{8875}{8911}and he's already down!
{8912}{8999}Excuse me, sir,|we just got some big news.
{9000}{9097}The word is, the Iceman's|day of arrival is tomorrow.
{9098}{9138}E.T.A., 2 p.m.
{9139}{9187}Now, Vern Van Zant|said he got those...
{9188}{9234}brand-new tattoos|just for this occasion.
{9235}{9263}Well, Vern, don't look like...
{9264}{9310}the parryâ€™s gonna last|too long for you.
{9310}{9412}This guy is a bum--|big, uncoordinated motherfucker.
{9413}{9445}Nine...
{9480}{9552}Look at me! You OK? Box!
{9590}{9652}Ah, here we go again!|Monroe's on the hunt.
{9653}{9693}Vern, swinging and a-missing,
{9694}{9757}Ooh! And another left,|right to the midsection,
{9758}{9797}Left and right|uppercuts to the head!
{9798}{9844}Right to the head!|Right to the stomach,
{9845}{9887}This guy's just|a-swinging and a-missing!
{9888}{9924}Hits him with|a left and a right!
{9925}{9971}Monroe's just|tearing his ass up,
{9972}{10050}Right in the face!|Right to the head!
{10051}{10100}Left to the midsection!|Right to the head!
{10101}{10136}Another left and a right!
{10138}{10174}Oh, my God,|he shined his head up!
{10175}{10222}I told you,|he's shinin' it up!
{10294}{10342}One more time for Monroe,
{10342}{10388}Knockout! Knockout!
{10429}{10476}One round, motherfucker!
{10513}{10580}That's it! That's it!
{10581}{10721}It's done! This fight is over!|Monroe wins again!
{10765}{10795}Spit it.
{10796}{10844}Yeah, but I got a little|announcement for you.
{10845}{10879}Got a little|announcement for you.
{10880}{10913}Little news bulletin.
{10914}{10964}Y'all been wondering|when that day is coming.
{10965}{11047}Well, that day is tomorrow.|He's coming to Sweetwater.
{11048}{11084}The so-called undisputed...
{11085}{11132}heavyweight champion|of the world...
{11133}{11220}George "Iceman" Chambers!
{11270}{11315}What do you say to that,|Monroe? You ready?
{11563}{11642}OK, here we go. Tape rolling.
{11681}{11732}Former world|heavyweight champion,,,
{11733}{11775}George "Iceman" Chambers,,,
{11776}{11816}now you'll be moving|to a new home...
{11817}{11869}going to live with|murderers and thieves...
{11870}{11910}in California's newly-built...
{11911}{11957}Sweetwater Prison|in the Mojave Desert.
{11958}{12020}How's all this going for you?
{12021}{12107}I'll be OK.|I got a bad break.
{12108}{12154}I just gotta|play this thing out.
{12155}{12231}Your lawyers have filed|all the expected appeals,,,
{12232}{12303}but realistically, what do|you think of your chances,,,
{12304}{12341}of getting out|before serving,,,
{12342}{12402}the full sentence|of 6 to 8 years?
{12403}{12493}I'm not supposed to talk|about that legal stuff.
{12494}{12551}My people don't want me|commenting on that.
{12552}{12599}Boxing experts tend to agree...
{12600}{12660}that even as little|as two years in a prison...
{12662}{12719}without proper training|could mean the end...
{12720}{12773}for a boxer your age.|Now, you're regarded...
{12774}{12812}as one of the greatest|offensive fighters...
{12813}{12850}in the history of the sport...
{12851}{12909}an attacker|like Dempsey, Joe Louis,,,
{12910}{12981}Rocky Marciano, Joe Frazier,
{12982}{13049}Just exactly how|damaging to your skills,,,
{13050}{13097}is this prison stint|likely to be?
{13098}{13187}No damage.|I'll stay in shape, work out...
{13188}{13233}watch what I eat. I'll be fine.
{13234}{13305}But when an athlete|is removed from competition--
{13306}{13375}That's where you're making|one big mistake right off.
{13376}{13482}I'm not an athlete.|I'm a gladiator.
{13483}{13521}How do you define that?
{13522}{13632}People play baseball.|Nobody plays boxing.
{13633}{13701}Iceman, last week after|you were convicted,,,
{13702}{13776}boxing's various|so-called governing bodies...
{13777}{13823}began stripping you of|your title belts...
{13824}{13857}stripping you--
{13858}{13900}Who they think they kidding?
{13901}{13946}Everybody knows I'm the champ.
{13947}{13999}And I'm gonna be the champ|till I quit.
{14483}{14553}This fight with|Manfredy is meant to be,,,
{14554}{14601}just a tune-up for|George "The Iceman" Chambers,,,
{14602}{14640}hopefully leading|to the unification bout,,,
{14641}{14673}with Montel Briscoe,,,
{14674}{14738}undefeated holder|of the WBC crown,
{14739}{14801}The two biggest names in boxing|on a collision course,,,
{14802}{14841}sometime next year,,,
{14842}{14917}assuming the Iceman gets by|the South American challenger,
{15025}{15103}It's round 1 and one to go,|and it's all Iceman!
{15104}{15180}He's stalking Manfredy,|chasing the big South American,
{15293}{15333}Iceman with a right,|another right,
{15334}{15398}Another right|and a left to the body!
{15399}{15487}Oh, and a right-hand uppercut,|That staggered Manfredy!
{15488}{15563}Iceman stalking him,|He knows he's got him hurt,
{15564}{15635}Oh, body shots!|Right, left to the body!
{15636}{15698}Left hook and he's down!|He's down! He's down!
{15699}{15763}That's why they call him|the Iceman!
{15802}{15837}Well, Carlos Manfredy,,,
{15838}{15904}gets a one-way ticket|back to Brazil!
{15949}{15986}George "Iceman" Chambers,,,
{15987}{16049}remains undefeated|heavyweight champion!
{16050}{16109}And the big man on the block!
{16248}{16308}Are you fighting Montel next?
{16310}{16363}Just another sucker who's|gonna get his ass whipped.
{16364}{16424}If the money's right,|bring on Montel.
{16426}{16471}Nobody's running,|nobody's ducking.
{16472}{16567}Nobody--l mean, nobody--|can stand up to what I got.
{16568}{16601}Does that include Montel?
{16602}{16650}Oh, yeah, that damn sure|includes Montel.
{16700}{16730}Mr. Lewis!
{16731}{16791}Estimates are up|to 300 million dollars...
{16792}{16831}for the pay-per-view|gate alone.
{16832}{16863}Any comment on that?
{16864}{16903}Let's make the deal first.
{16904}{17007}But my first guess is|you're a few million short.
{17008}{17062}And, Iceman,|it's nine months till summer.
{17063}{17095}What's next for you?
{17096}{17140}Well, first of all,|I'm gonna go to L.A...
{17141}{17176}you know, see some friends...
{17178}{17223}then I'm gonna do|a little partying.
{17315}{17355}Hey, hey...that's it.
{17356}{17389}I've done things in my life...
{17390}{17438}maybe I shouldn't have.|I know that.
{17438}{17513}But I did not want to,|and I told him "No."
{17674}{17742}You'll be moving|into a new home,,,
{17742}{17797}going to live with|murderers and thieves,,,
{17799}{17831}in California's newly-built,,,
{17831}{17890}Sweetwater Prison|in the Mojave Desert,
{17890}{17931}Without getting into|legal strategy,,,
{17931}{17965}let's discuss your trial.
{17967}{18006}You continue to maintain|your innocence.
{18008}{18053}I didn't rape nobody.
{18054}{18102}I done a lot of wrong shit|in my life...
{18102}{18150}but I ain't no punk-ass rapist.
{18150}{18207}Look at me.|What I gotta rape somebody for?
{19019}{19056}Psst. Monroe.
{19057}{19094}You see him through the window?
{19095}{19144}Big deal's got his own|helicopter service...
{19145}{19190}instead of coming|in here on the bus.
{19191}{19241}He's the champ.
{19242}{19318}What's this shit?|Don't think negative, man.
{19319}{19354}I don't want to hear that shit.
{19355}{19404}This is your house.|You own this place.
{19449}{19506}If this was my house,|I could get up and leave.
{19742}{19774}He's here.
{19775}{19816}Just getting out|of the helicopter.
{19817}{19884}Maybe you'd like to meet him,|Mr. Ripstein.
{19885}{19936}I could bring him over.|You two could talk boxing.
{19937}{20012}I'll tell you when|I want to talk to him.
{20208}{20277}Why couldn't your high-priced|team of lawyers...
{20278}{20325}convince a judge and a jury?
{20327}{20387}Because I put people|in body bags on TV...
{20388}{20434}and get paid|a lot of money for it.
{20435}{20494}Because I'm a big, bad,|black motherfucker--
{20495}{20538}that's why nobody believes me.
{20539}{20605}I have received|over 170 requests...
{20606}{20662}for interviews with you,|Mr. Chambers.
{20663}{20702}Networks, local TV, cable...
{20703}{20752}ever newspaper organization|in the country...
{20753}{20830}foreign press, foreign TV--|you name it,
{20831}{20883}I have turned them all down,
{20884}{20968}Mr. Chambers,|here is Sweetwater,
{20969}{21013}Maximum security, level five...
{21014}{21056}state correctional|institution...
{21057}{21116}with nearly|seven hundred prisoners.
{21117}{21216}We house only murderers,|armed robbers, rapists,,,
{21217}{21258}and those with|connections to gangs,,,
{21259}{21310}and other forms|of organized crime.
{21311}{21406}The state is trying to|spare lesser criminals...
{21407}{21479}the contaminating influence|of these more hardened types.
{21480}{21563}Now, we don't want|any incidents that might add,,,
{21564}{21620}to your already great|difficulties, Mr. Chambers,
{21621}{21669}This is Mr. Mercker.
{21671}{21730}He's the senior prison officer,|He's the head guard,
{21731}{21785}This is Ms. Early,|our administrative officer.
{21786}{21826}She can arrange|for religious counsel...
{21827}{21857}or instruction, if you wish.
{21858}{21974}Whatever.|I need a CD player and some CDs.
{21975}{22011}Now, I'll give you a list.
{22012}{22062}My people on the outside|will pay for it all.
{22063}{22106}Not possible|for the first six months.
{22107}{22141}It's a privilege,|has to be earned.
{22142}{22177}Any and all privileges,,,
{22179}{22239}will depend upon|your general conduct,
{22240}{22307}Mr. Chambers,|you have been convicted...
{22308}{22354}and sent here|for the crime of rape.
{22355}{22394}That's a very serious mater,
{22395}{22432}If you'd take advantage,,,
{22433}{22475}of this opportunity|to apologize,,,
{22476}{22528}to this woman|and to sports fans,,,
{22529}{22575}and the American public|for letting them down--
{22576}{22616}heck, even the former|president of the--
{22617}{22658}Man, fuck the president!
{22659}{22690}I ain't apologizing--
{22691}{22756}not to you, not to her,|not to nobody!
{22757}{22812}And you lucky I got this|damn gate between you and me...
{22813}{22885}or Iâ€™d rip you a new asshole,|you judgmental motherfucker!
{22923}{22979}Another strong|athlete in the joint!
{22980}{23041}Welcome to Sweetwater,|Chambers!
{23097}{23137}If you|need anything, champ,,,
{23138}{23169}I got you covered,
{23355}{23456}Hey, champ!|Seen all your fights, man!
{23673}{23706}You got a name?
{23737}{23802}Mingo.
{23803}{23916}Mingo, move your shit,|stay out of my way...
{23917}{23985}and we'll get along just fine.
{24117}{24197}Hey, listen. It's an honor|to be cellmates with you.
{24198}{24248}I don't want no trouble, champ.
{24249}{24325}No trouble. You just gonna|stay out of my way.
{24326}{24363}He just thinks he's the king.
{24364}{24432}Because he's the heavyweight|champ, he's the man.
{24433}{24486}Well, for some of us others,|we have rights, too...
{24487}{24577}and I had the right to say no|if I didn't want to.
{24578}{24661}I want everybody|to keep your distance.
{24663}{24719}I don't need to make|no new friends...
{24720}{24778}or hear no sad stories|on why they're here.
{24779}{24834}I got my own sad story for that.
{24835}{24890}I ain't loanin' nobody|no money...
{24891}{24933}so you tell 'em don't even ask.
{24934}{24990}And I don't want|nobody talking to me...
{24991}{25052}unless I talk to 'em first.
{25053}{25117}-You got that?|-Got it.
{25118}{25171}"Leave the champ alone."
{25358}{25417}I know boxing.
{25418}{25483}I seen a lot of fights.
{25484}{25564}You're a good champeen,
{25565}{25601}Who the hell are you?
{25603}{25646}This is Mendy Ripstein.
{25647}{25686}He's a very important man|in here.
{25687}{25724}Ripstein,
{25725}{25830}Yeah, my manager, Yank Lewis,|he told me to say hello.
{25831}{25864}I don't remember him.
{25865}{25924}He said you two|were friends in Miami...
{25925}{25973}about twenty-five years ago.
{25974}{26051}I didn't have|any friends in Miami.
{26052}{26141}A lot of people, they say|they knew me from the old days.
{26142}{26182}They're full of shit.
{26183}{26261}You're a good champeen...
{26262}{26345}but we got a champeen|right here...
{26347}{26413}and he can kick your ass.
{26492}{26523}Kiddin' me.
{26524}{26611}I watch all your fights.|You're not as good as you were.
{26612}{26671}You're just looking|for one big punch.
{26672}{26738}You're not|throwing combinations.
{26739}{26830}You're not using as much|head movement on defense.
{26831}{26860}Yeah, right, old man.
{26861}{26916}I'm just knocking|motherfuckers out.
{26917}{26976}Who's the punk in here|you got in mind?
{26977}{27077}Oh, did I hurt your feelings?
{27078}{27143}Fuck you.
{27270}{27362}Heh. Monroe.|Name's Monroe Hutchen.
{27363}{27428}Mr. Ripstein thinks|he can whip up on you, man...
{27429}{27532}but no offense. Not trying|to cause any trouble here.
{28119}{28162}# Hey, yo, it's real in here #
{28163}{28211}# All of these contenders know|just how it feels in here #
{28212}{28242}# When you're trin'|to be the top boss #
{28243}{28275}# Put your gloves on, then #
{28276}{28308}# This here|be the sport of men #
{28309}{28342}# Everybody|wants a shot at me #
{28343}{28374}# One word,|you get knocked out #
{28375}{28410}# Rocked out the box #
{28411}{28446}# Only men|leave a place like this #
{28447}{28486}# Hardcore,|I'm in your face like this #
{28487}{28524}# Tell your mama that|you'll never come home #
{28525}{28554}# Tell your mama that|you'll never come home #
{28931}{28997}Which one of these suckers|in here is Monroe Hutchen?
{28998}{29108}He's over there in line,|wearing a white cap.
{29109}{29152}What's happening, Mo? Yeah.
{29153}{29211}Brought in|some big guys in here.
{29212}{29281}He beat 'em all.
{29282}{29343}It ain't only about being big.
{29344}{29403}You gotta have skill, son.
{29668}{29716}You Monroe Hutchen?
{29788}{29820}Yep.
{29821}{29907}I guess you know who I am.
{29908}{29996}Are you the champion in here?
{29997}{30054}Yeah.
{30055}{30129}Not the heavyweight champ.
{30179}{30231}Champion...
{30232}{30294}heavyweight or|any other kind they got.
{30295}{30413}I didn't even know they had|boxing in a place like this.
{30414}{30477}Well, it's a special program.
{30478}{30539}We only get bouts|ever six months.
{30540}{30609}Mostly we fight guys|from other prisons.
{30610}{30668}How long you been on top?
{30669}{30758}Ten years.|Ever since I got in here.
{30759}{30855}Damn. Brother, that's|a real fine record you got.
{30856}{30920}I gotta congratulate you.
{30921}{30978}Yeah! You want some of this?
{30979}{31020}Yeah! Come on!
{31021}{31065}I'm gonna win.
{31066}{31117}Come on! What?
{31118}{31185}Ain't no champ in here but me!
{31232}{31302}I'm giving you another chance.
{31303}{31372}I'm inclined to overlook|what happened this afternoon,,,
{31373}{31421}and not make it a par of|your official record,
{31473}{31564}Look, let's get something|straight, Mr. Warden.
{31565}{31652}I'm not just some convict|doing five to ten.
{31653}{31737}I'm a real big deal.
{31739}{31793}Not only am I|heavyweight champ...
{31794}{31869}I'm close to being the most|famous man in the world.
{31870}{31908}So if you think|you're gonna lean on me...
{31909}{31946}like these punks|you got in here...
{31947}{31976}you better think again...
{31977}{32027}because if anything|happens to me...
{32028}{32120}it's gonna be on|the 6:00 news worldwide.
{32121}{32160}There's gonna be|a whole lot of people...
{32161}{32210}askin' a whole lot|of questions...
{32211}{32260}and you and your little crew|here better know that.
{32261}{32309}Just my luck he got sent here.
{32310}{32386}Iceman, my ass.|He's just another goddamn thug.
{32387}{32438}One who happens|to be a world champion...
{32439}{32509}and a potential|public relations nightmare.
{32689}{32762}Mr. Hutchen.
{32763}{32801}You know the little problem...
{32802}{32856}you had with|the Iceman yesterday?
{32857}{32899}Got you in some trouble.
{32936}{32994}Heavyweight champ.
{32995}{33047}Man gave me a cheap shot.
{33048}{33084}Yeah, I know,
{33085}{33126}By the court|and the higher powers,,,
{33127}{33195}you contributed to a situation|that threatened violence.
{33196}{33257}One thing you ought|to know by now, Monroe,
{33258}{33334}Life ain't fair,|Not fair at all,
{33535}{33574}The warden understands,,,
{33575}{33615}what he's doing|is unfortunate,,,
{33616}{33670}but unless Mr. Hutchen|and the Iceman are separated,,,
{33671}{33706}there will be|enormous pressure,,,
{33707}{33762}for another|physical confrontation,
{33763}{33798}Nobody likes this...
{33799}{33846}but Mr. Hutchen's presence|is an incitement to violence...
{33847}{33910}and he will be kept in there|until such time...
{33911}{33997}as we can make arrangements for|his travel to another facility.
{34237}{34292}OK.
{34331}{34364}Hey, Monroe.
{34365}{34413}Take care of yourself|in there, Monroe.
{34538}{34557}Sergeant Marinez|to the hill tower,
{34557}{34612}Sergeant Marinez|to the hill tower,
{34613}{34673}Sergeant Marinez|to the hill tower,
{34763}{34821}New duty roster just got posted.
{34822}{34899}You're working|in the kitchen with me.
{34900}{34964}Look, since we're gonna|be stuck together...
{34965}{35054}what you in here for?
{35055}{35103}You know, champ,|I don't mean to be...
{35104}{35174}telling you what to do|or anything, but...
{35175}{35277}it's not considered polite|to ask why we're here.
{35278}{35353}Kinda violation of the ethics.|You know, the code?
{35354}{35382}Yeah.
{35383}{35465}People take it as disrespect.
{35467}{35571}Yo! You keeping in shape,|Mr. Iceman?
{35572}{35646}Who's this chump?
{35647}{35736}Call him Ratbag.|Runs with Monroe.
{35737}{35765}Shit.
{35766}{35815}Thinks he's his manager,
{35816}{35881}-Ratbag?|-Ratbag.
{35950}{36056}OK, Ratbag,|what you in here for?
{36105}{36172}-Me?|-Yeah, you.
{36226}{36270}Arson.
{36271}{36370}Nothin' up close and personal.
{36371}{36429}You hit people much?
{36430}{36472}What do you mean?
{36473}{36526}You know, punch people.
{36527}{36587}When you were a kid|or since you been in here.
{36588}{36661}Sometimes. Not much.
{36662}{36706}I never was the physical type.
{36707}{36777}You want to hit me?
{36778}{36873}What, are you kidding?
{36875}{36926}You can say you did it.
{36927}{36973}"I punched|the heavyweight champ."
{36974}{37008}You can tell people|all about it.
{37009}{37037}It might even make you...
{37038}{37099}feel good about|your little punk-ass self.
{37100}{37164}I don't want to hit you, Iceman.|Shit!
{37165}{37193}Sure you do!
{37194}{37241}You don't even like me.|Come on, man.
{37242}{37298}Go crazy. Let one go.
{37299}{37357}If I hit you just this once,|will that end it?
{37358}{37394}I won't have to hit you anymore?
{37395}{37448}All you gotta do|is hit me one time...
{37449}{37506}and I'm telling you, man,|it'll make you feel good...
{37507}{37570}and it ain't gonna hurt me none.
{37571}{37614}Aright. Just once.
{37615}{37672}Just to satisfy whatever|weird trip you're on...
{37673}{37702}and show you|that I'm a good guy...
{37703}{37742}trying to do what you want.
{37743}{37774}Right. Thank you.
{37775}{37832}You're welcome.
{37899}{37926}Unh!
{37927}{37965}Ohh! Yeah, baby!
{37966}{38057}Oh, yeah! Yeah!|I hit the Iceman!
{38058}{38086}Yo!
{38118}{38203}-Yeah!|-Thank you.
{38204}{38248}You still feel good, Ratbag?
{38249}{38305}Yeah. I guess so.
{38306}{38352}You're not mad, are you?
{38353}{38396}Ohh! Damn!
{38397}{38442}No, I'm not mad at you.
{38443}{38514}Now, you go tell Monroe|what I said.
{38515}{38562}Ain't but one champ in here!
{38563}{38626}And it ain't some|nickel-and-dime convict,,,
{38627}{38674}beating up on fools in prison!
{38675}{38727}Get that bitch outta here.
