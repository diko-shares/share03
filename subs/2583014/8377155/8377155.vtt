WEBVTT

1
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.140
How much longer we gonna sit?

2
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.480
Uh, I'm parking enough cash to
be heartbroken when we bust him.

3
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.640
That's some twisted shit.

4
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.460
The harder they fall, the worse it hurts.

5
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.850
Now how you gonna run shit
when you get transferred West Side?

6
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.020
Uh, I'm off then.

7
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.940
You tell Molly yet?

8
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.080
When the time's right.

9
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.740
Here we go.

10
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.340
Shit!

11
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.740
Damn it, this fuck is fast!

12
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.780
Stop! Police!

13
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760
Just slow down, goddamn it!

14
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.720
You're some bullshit, man.

15
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720
I've seen you before.

16
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500
You got a keystone high?

17
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.980
What's it to you?

18
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320
Another year or two.

19
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.180
This doesn't go down as a jiffy fuckup.

20
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.620
Empty pockets.

21
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.220
Empty goddamn pockets.

22
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.840
Aight, man.

23
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240
Aight.

24
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120
Is that everything?

25
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.171
You trying to Rob me or book me?

26
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.790
Stay off the corner.

27
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.650
I'll get you out there again.

28
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.250
You can take it personally.

29
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640
Hang on, book him.

30
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.240
Nah, we'll go to the good.

31
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720
Come on.

32
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.891
What's the problem we gonna
do with a couple hundred bucks?

33
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160
Nah, I'm good.

34
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.410
You know that ain't me.

35
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.270
You know I hate these midday calls.

36
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.510
No high honey, love
of my life, happy to hear

37
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.970
your voice, or just cuff
straight to the chase?

38
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.130
You're right.

39
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.396
You can't force these things, Molly.

40
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.680
Whatever.

41
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.841
I'm not calling for a friendly check-in.

42
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.220
Trev got sent home again today.

43
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.240
Put him off.

44
00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:39.720
He's not with me. Your dad picked him up.

45
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.450
Where'd he take him?

46
00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:45.670
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

47
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.490
Clean up your face.

48
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.270
You know, my father,
you consider you family.

49
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.270
You and your sons.

50
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.890
I know.

51
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.070
If anyone else would be as much money
as you do, I would have taken a night.

52
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.710
I'll get it to you tomorrow.

53
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.710
Crinkle?

54
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.110
What happened?

55
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.730
Nothing that can't be fixed.

56
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.690
Trev, you here?

57
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.631
What about did you just say?

58
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.950
I didn't want to leave your boy alone.

59
00:05:33.185 --> 00:05:34.226
Yes, I'm going to tell me.

60
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400
Give him a break.

61
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.420
I don't remember breaks being
a part of your parenting playbook.

62
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.461
How many times did I pull
you out of the principal's office?

63
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.180
A bloody, some poor sucker's nose.

64
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.820
Huh?

65
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Let me see your hands.

66
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.140
Make a fist.

67
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.460
No.

68
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.100
Always comes on the outside.

69
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.260
I'll get a break.

70
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800
Good.

71
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.800
Get your homework done.

72
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.251
How'd you get that shiner?

73
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.080
Buying time on a late
payment to Miss Ash Dunn.

74
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.971
You came here looking for a loan.

75
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.580
I can't stick you.

76
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.640
I don't need a loan. I need you.

77
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.701
I'm not interested in your scam.
You got gone.

78
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960
It's not a scam.

79
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.600
Straight trade-off.

80
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.381
Things come to you straight up.

81
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.600
Turn crooked real quick.

82
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.060
Not this time. Just hear me out.

83
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.620
If you're not interested,
I'll get out of sight.

84
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.700
You got until I finish this
drink, then you're gone.

85
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120
So talk.

86
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.940
I got a score plan for tonight.

87
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.800
Your brother was supposed to
be my backup, but he flaked again.

88
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.700
Easy money. Two hours tops.

89
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.640
We make a drop, pick up a payday.

90
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.041
It's so easy. Why don't you do it yourself?

91
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.860
It's a two-man job.

92
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.540
If I go in there alone, these
guys are gonna fleece me.

93
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.540
Two hundred large for two hours work.

94
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.280
We do a 50-50 split.

95
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.500
See, real money, not that chunky you
pick up on street corner shakedowns.

96
00:07:32.665 --> 00:07:33.665
And if it goes wrong?

97
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.820
It won't.

98
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200
Because you say so?

99
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.260
Because it's what I do.

100
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240
It's all I know.

101
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440
Time's up.

102
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.300
You used to be somebody.

103
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.660
Maybe you're too dumb to see it.

104
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:02.960
But I do.

105
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760
Do yourself a favor.

106
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.060
Make a play.

107
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.920
Or you still got a shot
at something better.

108
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.250
You're starting to think
you weren't gonna show up.

109
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.310
Minor delay.

110
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.170
But we all good.

111
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.830
And what happened to
my little buddy Spencer?

112
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.170
The other boy is subbing in. This is Neil.

113
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.050
You got a problem with that?

114
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.810
No.

115
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.070
Come on in.

116
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:55.870
Let's get this going.

117
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.630
So, what do we got?

118
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.350
Four keys. Like we agreed.

119
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.370
Mm-hmm.

120
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.790
Mind if I have a little sample?

121
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.110
It's good.
We should be doing bigger business.

122
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.930
I got a lot of money coming
down the pipeline, man.

123
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.650
Introduce me to your supplier.

124
00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:40.030
You can't do that.

125
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.570
I don't control the traffic
in this negative woods.

126
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.590
Best not to press your luck.

127
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.530
Okay.

128
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.250
Deal's a deal, right?

129
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.830
Deal's a deal.

130
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.980
Now, take him down.

131
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.720
What the fuck?

132
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700
Hey, man, it's easy.

133
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.170
DEA, motherfuckers.

134
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.250
How'd you get that shiner?

135
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.890
Light time. Unrelate payment.

136
00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.750
To miss ash done.

137
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.880
But you still got a shot
at something better.

138
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.930
Hey, Spencer. What's up, little bro?

139
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.390
You look good, man.

140
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.520
Did you?

141
00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:43.290
Yeah, I wonder what you think.

142
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.370
I think either you boosted it,

143
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.626
or you scammed somebody
into high and used a chauffeur.

144
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.650
Nah, man.

145
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.710
Ash wants to ride.

146
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.930
She's got me one of the collection routes.

147
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.130
You don't pick up some ash done?

148
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.090
It's part-time gig till the
figure something else out, man.

149
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.490
Swear to me.

150
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.570
You always get me from her.

151
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.130
I look stupid.

152
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.410
You look strung out.

153
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.710
What? See?

154
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.890
Sure doesn't know.

155
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.770
What the fuck out of here, man?

156
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.970
Serious, man.

157
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.450
What the fuck does that mean, man?

158
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.970
An arm test?

159
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.030
I visited Pops the other day.

160
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.530
He's not holding up too well.

161
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.670
When the cancer spreads to his brain,

162
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.350
Doc says he only has a few months left.

163
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.890
Big matters were he's talking
about cooperating with the fence.

164
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.830
What?

165
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.730
He says he doesn't want to
spend his last days in a cell box.

166
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.770
He's gonna try to cut a
deal, give up some names.

167
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.310
Who else knows about this?

168
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:17.910
In town?

169
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.490
In just me.

170
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.810
Has he reached out to the Fed yet?

171
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.210
I don't know.

172
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.530
He got heated when I told
him to keep his mouth shut.

173
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.010
You gotta talk to him.
He'll listen to you. He owes you.

174
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640
Is this the right way?

175
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.580
Ash is looking to get with me.

176
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.560
About what?

177
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.280
I don't know.

178
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.500
Tell me to bring you
in straight from county.

179
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.020
Neil.

180
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.840
How was your vacation in Fayette?

181
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.880
Two years too long.

182
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.580
I did the same stretch, remember?

183
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.640
At Mercer?

184
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.360
It took a while for my father.

185
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.180
Best two years I ever spent.

186
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.210
Not just for the
connections you make on the

187
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.660
inside, but the appreciation
you gain for freedom

188
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.780
and how quickly it can be taken away.

189
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.130
Please.

190
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.750
Sit.

191
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.830
I honestly thought you'd
be happier to see me.

192
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:12.650
A friendly face.

193
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.830
Someone who's had your
back since we were kids.

194
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.190
Just got a lot on my mind, that's all.

195
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.710
Yeah.

196
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.270
Have you ever wondered
how you got through two

197
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.310
years in that fucking
dungeon without scratch?

198
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.330
Like maybe you had a guardian
angel that made you untouchable.

199
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.230
Maybe it's that same guardian angel

200
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.130
that put shoes on your son's feet
and extra money on your wife's pocket.

201
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.710
Her wife?

202
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.590
She didn't tell you.

203
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.570
Yeah, she's been tending
bar three nights a week,

204
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.330
coming up in a year now.

205
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.230
By the way, I spoke to your P.O. last week.

206
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.350
And guess what?

207
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.710
She's gonna let me handle you

208
00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:06.850
if you're a good boy and do what I say.

209
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.310
If you offer me a job, the answer's no.

210
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.890
Are there any other
prospects I'm unaware of?

211
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.350
They're hot market for ex-cop drug dealers?

212
00:17:18.755 --> 00:17:22.490
Because from my point of view,
you're toxic to anyone but me.

213
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.270
I got a hundred thousand dollars in dead
money on my books from your old man.

214
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.270
And since he's indisposed indefinitely,

215
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.950
well, his dead passes
on to the next of kin.

216
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.890
The both of you.

217
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.350
Whatever you wish is between you and him.

218
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.010
I mean, don't get me wrong.

219
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.290
I respect him serving his time in silence.

220
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.890
Smart move for your family.

221
00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.580
But that doesn't mean I
can wipe the slate clean.

222
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.470
You could Rob a bank

223
00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:57.590
and get squared with me with one score.

224
00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.250
Or you can start on my clock.

225
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.810
A lot to digest.

226
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.610
Take the night. We'll talk tomorrow.

227
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.260
Wish me luck.

228
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.920
Good luck.

229
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.970
What's up, Papi?

230
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.690
Do it.

231
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.250
Guy, I can't tell you how
good it is to see your face

232
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:13.830
without a piece of plexiglass
between the two of us.

233
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.670
No, I thought we agreed you'd stay at
Spencer's until we figured things out.

234
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.150
I couldn't wait.

235
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.030
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:21.330
No.

237
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.450
Can I come in?

238
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.010
Just for a minute.

239
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.680
There's my big man.

240
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.660
Damn, boy, you filled out good.

241
00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:48.900
Look at you.

242
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.980
Keeping up your grades?

243
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.860
He made honorable last semester.

244
00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980
Wow.

245
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.640
Brains of the family, just like Mom, right?

246
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.320
Aw, Shucks, look at you, man.

247
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.240
You started balling?

248
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.860
No, not really.

249
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.240
Aunt Ash gave me these for my birthday.

250
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.780
Aunt Ash.

251
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.600
She's been helping out,

252
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.780
filling in a few gaps
while you've been gone.

253
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.020
Yeah, I heard you were
working nights for her, too.

254
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:26.930
Just a couple of shifts a week.

255
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.060
Well, you can drop dead now that I'm back.

256
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.620
We need the money.

257
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.120
Take it from me.

258
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.480
But you don't have any.

259
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.170
I should get back to studying.

260
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.630
Do you see a future for us?

261
00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.380
If I'd wanted to divorce you,

262
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.840
I would have served your
papers while you were locked up.

263
00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:16.660
So...

264
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.320
What do I have to do?

265
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.740
For now, stay out of trouble.

266
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.080
Show me you can do that.

267
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:29.370
What is it to be here?

268
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.630
This place is a mess.

269
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.350
Couch is comfort in the
bed, but you can have either.

270
00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.180
Couch is fine.

271
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.170
You want anything?

272
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:58.430
Get a... Want a... Want a beer?

273
00:21:59.030 --> 00:21:59.350
Nah.

274
00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:02.491
I'm just gonna...
crash if that's cool.

275
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.150
Yeah, man, of course.

276
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.490
Rest up, you know, get
you all set for tomorrow.

277
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.410
Back on your feet.

278
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.710
Hey, Spence.

279
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.090
Yeah.

280
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.880
Thanks for taking me in, man.

281
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.230
Of course, man.

282
00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.210
It's your brother's offer.

283
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:23.251
It's your brother's offer.

284
00:22:36.260 --> 00:23:39.530
Come on, man.

285
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.130
I'm going to get you.

286
00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.050
I'm going to get you.

287
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.390
I'm going to get you.

288
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:56.150
I'm going to get you.

289
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.790
I'm gonna need y'all
to step out of the truck.

290
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.950
I wasn't asking.

291
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I don't know.

292
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.660
Should we open it?

293
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.420
I'll open it up.

294
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.240
We got him.

295
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.460
Told you.

296
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240
All right, handsome.

297
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.640
Let's see what you got in there.

298
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920
Oh!

299
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.120
Any problems?

300
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440
Nah.

301
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.400
We killed it.

302
00:25:33.525 --> 00:25:34.860
I might need you again on Sunday.

303
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.540
And him.

304
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040
Of course.

305
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.560
Look at you, moving up in the world.

306
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.800
This one's for you, whether
or not you buy the batch.

307
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
What'd you eat this?

308
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:45.710
It fell into my lap.

309
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.640
I'm moving this on the street.

310
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.336
I should know who's looking for it.

311
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.380
All you need to decide is
whether the product is profitable.

312
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.740
If it is, you push it.

313
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.200
If it isn't, you pass.

314
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.140
Give her that back.

315
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:12.430
You know, your father would
have never done a deal like this.

316
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:13.690
Like what?

317
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.050
Born in second-hand heroin.

318
00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:16.850
And where is he now?

319
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:19.950
I'm not here.

320
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:21.590
Right.

321
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.370
The way he did things bought him a bullet.

322
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.350
Leon, I'm expanding
on what my father built.

323
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.913
And I do this because
I'm better at it than you

324
00:27:29.925 --> 00:27:31.930
or my father or anyone
else out there really.

325
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.870
So next time you're thinking
about questioning me,

326
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.422
don't put your foot in
your mouth because

327
00:27:38.434 --> 00:27:40.590
I'm going to ram it
down your fucking throat.

328
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.150
I need to work with you.

329
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.670
Is there a problem?

330
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.790
My truck went missing yesterday.

331
00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.470
Missing? Stolen?

332
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.370
We saw police using the shipment.

333
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.450
Well, I can try to make
some calls, track it down,

334
00:28:52.451 --> 00:28:54.783
but odds are it's in
evidence, which means

335
00:28:54.795 --> 00:28:57.250
you're better off moving
into the next load.

336
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.130
Any reason your man driving
the truck might have played you?

337
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.470
No.

338
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:03.830
Not a chance.

339
00:29:09.945 --> 00:29:11.550
Then we'll Chuck it up to bad luck.

340
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.670
Good news is that I have
eyes in every corner in the city.

341
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.250
Something unholy went down.

342
00:29:20.115 --> 00:29:21.350
It'll trickle to me.

343
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.730
And you guys will be the first to know.

344
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.250
Maybe next time, be more careful.

345
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.020
Why would we eat half honey?

346
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.840
I want order from her.

347
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.900
Dream's the same no matter
if it's handling the bottle.

348
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.100
Send her over.

349
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.460
What are you doing here?

350
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.420
What would it take for
you to leave right now?

351
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.180
What? This job?

352
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.740
This city.

353
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.020
And go where?

354
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.220
Anywhere but here.

355
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200
With you?

356
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.500
The only reason I'm here
right now is because of you.

357
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.690
I wasn't sure I'd get to see you again.

358
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.550
You get out early.

359
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.470
Good behavior.

360
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.610
Your sentence was pennies compared to mine.

361
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.830
How's Molly traveling up?

362
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.410
Getting on without me.

363
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.270
You gonna talk to me or
you just come to sit and stare?

364
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.036
Spence told me looking
to cut a deal with effect.

365
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.060
Get your voice down.

366
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.220
I haven't talked to him yet.

367
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:50.040
I didn't reach out to that same
DEA fucker that busted us.

368
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.490
You do that and you're
putting all of our lives at risk.

369
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.300
Molly, Tram, nobody's
going to give shit to them.

370
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.820
The minute you roll, word only to
Ash that you're giving up names.

371
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.940
She'll grab hold of whatever
leverage she can find.

372
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.500
Spike will bench hasn't
done shit for me in here.

373
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.120
That's why you're rolling on her.

374
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:08.820
Dad.

375
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.560
Because she hasn't done shit for you.

376
00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:13.480
Yeah, I'm breathing a borrowed time.

377
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.280
Two months tops.

378
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.060
I'm not gonna spend my last days.

379
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.580
in this fucking tomb.

380
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.560
So that's your plan?

381
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.700
You dish some dirt, then you're home free.

382
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.480
Let me give you some advice.

383
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.480
Because I've actually built a case before.

384
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.920
Cool.

385
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.320
You're stepping back into them shoes.

386
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.560
I've been through this with guys like you.

387
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.270
Guys looking to make a quick confession.

388
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.240
They get up before they get stung.

389
00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.800
It doesn't happen.

390
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.220
You tell your story and then you stay put.

391
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.360
And then the case is airtight.

392
00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.320
And then maybe, just maybe,
you'll get a glimpse of daylight.

393
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.640
But while you're behind
bars, you're a target.

394
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.800
And whatever protection they are
promising you, it won't be enough.

395
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.240
Someone will get to you.

396
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.620
I ain't going down like that.

397
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.400
I ain't going down without a fight.

398
00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.210
How's the food?

399
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:51.650
Delicious as always.

400
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.090
Me staying safe out there?

401
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:53.950
You know it.

402
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:54.510
Fine too.

403
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:55.970
You feel safe.

404
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.270
I do when you're around.

405
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.726
Come on, that's what I like to hear.

406
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:59.750
Come back, Sam.

407
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.790
You know I will.

408
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.530
Call me back for your job back.

409
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:31.550
So they got you in rotation.

410
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.400
Strategic reassignment
is what they're calling it.

411
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.881
I said my skills were
better suited as a bricklayer.

412
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.240
I should have made detective by now.

413
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.340
It's tough to rise up the ranks when
your partner gets busted as dirty.

414
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:50.780
Doesn't exactly make me the
top candidate for a promotion.

415
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.800
Look, we were partners for eight years.

416
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.660
And I did a lot of things
to compromise both of us.

417
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.040
And that wasn't fair to you, Lass.

418
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.600
And to be honest, you're my best friend.

419
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.240
I'll do anything to make it right.

420
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.480
I just want to get better apologies.

421
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.231
You should try that on your wife.

422
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.140
It won't be that easy with her.

423
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.420
You don't owe me anything,
but I got to ask your favor.

424
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.780
The DEA agent that clipped
me, I need you to reach out.

425
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.580
Set up a meet.

426
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.180
What type of meet?

427
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.201
I'm not looking to settle any scores.

428
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.860
But he's got my dad on
the hook for a parole deal.

429
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.720
Graham's going to snitch?

430
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600
On who?

431
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.900
Dash Dunn.

432
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.700
Fuck.

433
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160
Hola.

434
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.391
Are you sitting down with my father?

435
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160
Mmm.

436
00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.740
He tells me he's got something
he wants to get off his chest.

437
00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.660
I'll give you something better.

438
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.960
I've got to end with Dash Dunn.

439
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:17.791
What are you doing, mopping floors?

440
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.780
Because if you're killing
for her, I can't make a deal.

441
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.660
I mean, I could, but I won't.

442
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.960
I'm not FBI. I don't give a flying
fuck about the body she's dropped.

443
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.620
I don't care about what she's selling.

444
00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.460
Well, that's what I'll give you.

445
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:35.240
I'll give you locations, identities of
every legal asset she's ever owned.

446
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.660
I'll serve you a career
case and a silver platter.

447
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.780
You know, all you got to
do is stay with my father.

448
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.570
You know, I had a CI embedded with her.

449
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.310
This guy was careful.
My guy never took any chances.

450
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.390
Three weeks in, he vanishes.

451
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.650
She sniffed him out.
I don't know how, but she did.

452
00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.050
She'll do the same to you.
I don't care how safe you play.

453
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.820
I'm not playing it safe.

454
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.040
I'm playing to win.

455
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:11.450
I give you two days to give
me something legitimate on Ash.

456
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.491
And then I'm bleeding
your pop for all he's got.

457
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.640
These were my father's.

458
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.260
When I was a little girl, he told me that
everything I needed to know about life,

459
00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:39.580
I could learn from this plant.

460
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.960
So he gave me one.
Told me to try to kill it.

461
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.140
And I neglected it,
bleached it, kept it in the dark,

462
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.720
and he refused to die.

463
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.320
And I realized he was right,

464
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.140
that the elements of its
survival were internalized,

465
00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.820
immune to outside influences.

466
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.200
But the one thing it needed was inside it.

467
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.200
See, you, you've created an existence
dependent on the fate of others.

468
00:38:14.201 --> 00:38:17.180
Your father, brother, son, wife.

469
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.340
These connections compromise you.
They make you vulnerable.

470
00:38:23.585 --> 00:38:28.020
Which is why you need people
like me to protect your interests.

471
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.410
I'm going to work for
you, clean my father's debt.

472
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:40.410
What was this done?
You let Molly walk away.

473
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.210
That's what she wants?

474
00:38:45.211 --> 00:38:47.790
That's what I want.

475
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.810
You do that, and I'm yours.

476
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.710
Deal.

477
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:12.830
The fuck's going on?

478
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.021
Fat ass waddles into my
joint telling me I got to shut

479
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.740
it down for the day, costing
me a ton of fucking cash.

480
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.120
And when I don't earn, you don't earn.

481
00:39:20.585 --> 00:39:21.816
So if we're going to be partners,

482
00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.460
I can't have Shrek micromanaging
me all the fucking time.

483
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.101
Anything else you want
to get off your chest?

484
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.880
Yeah. What's the problem?

485
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.996
Don't tell me you're trying
to renegotiate the split.

486
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.960
I bust my ass every fucking day,

487
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.896
so you can send your goons in once
a week to pick up a fucking envelope.

488
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.240
Now it's going to come to an end.

489
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.160
Good. I'm glad.

490
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.160
Have you been fucking me?

491
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.340
Yes, or no?

492
00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.280
Holy fucker.

493
00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.660
I hear you've been fucking
me in broad daylight,

494
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.380
scamming side bets to
screw me out of a fair share.

495
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.540
No, I haven't fucked you.

496
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.940
The longer you deny, the worse it gets.

497
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.600
Oh, okay.

498
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.840
It's just twice.
A couple guys with a lot of talent.

499
00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.860
I swear to God, I'll pay you back.

500
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.860
I won't hit one again. I got money.

501
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.940
Finish him.

502
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.420
Ash, I got money in the fucking car.

503
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.100
Come on, Neil.

504
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440
Finish him.

505
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:36.980
Neil, don't fucking talk.

506
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.800
This is the only way you gave my trust.

507
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.200
Do it for your wife and son.

508
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.630
Fuck!

509
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.990
Seriously?

510
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.110
The shoulder?

511
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.750
I'm not killing that unarmed man.

512
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.070
Maybe you're not, but
you're still going to Bury him.

513
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.250
No, I'm not.

514
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.410
Ash, come on.

515
00:41:12.130 --> 00:43:07.190
What the fuck are you doing, Spence? Neil!

516
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.530
No, you don't have to stay!
I just put the cream on!

517
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.446
You're doing that shit,
you're gonna do it just like that.

518
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.166
You're the dead piece of silk, Mark.
Is that what you want?

519
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:15.710
No! Is that what you know?

520
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:16.930
Say you're off.

521
00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.350
I was clean! Three months!

522
00:43:22.165 --> 00:43:24.110
Your man just slipped up in the set.

523
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.180
Fuck!

524
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.440
I'm leaving.

525
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.580
For what?

526
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.060
I gotta run and pick up some ash.

527
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.360
Give me the keys. I'm coming with you.

528
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.560
Give me the goddamn shoes.

529
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.380
One, two, three, shit!

530
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.800
Tax man, back again.

531
00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.640
I know this motherfucker.

532
00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360
Yo, kid!

533
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.340
Who's the cop?

534
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.680
Rip me on the corner a few years back.

535
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.520
Look, he's not even police anymore.

536
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:42.860
He got fired.

537
00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.060
He did his last two years of
my failure for a drug charge.

538
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.380
That right?

539
00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.420
I paroled last week.

540
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.560
And watched you flip sides?

541
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.640
Had no choice.

542
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040
I hear different.

543
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.260
Coming out for both of y'all.

544
00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040
You understand?

545
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.420
Get the fuck out of my shot!

546
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.850
Where's the drama?

547
00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:50.630
Straight to ash.

548
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:54.430
You know where she stores it?

549
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:55.790
She'll tell me.

550
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:58.530
Stash house?

551
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.470
Probably.

552
00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.030
Why are you gonna Rob her?

553
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.060
Where to next?

554
00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:59.950
Didn't I pay you a few weeks ago?

555
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:01.290
It's last month's dues.

556
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:03.710
Tell your boss.

557
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:05.550
I'll pay her at the docks.

558
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:06.870
Sunday.

559
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.610
If that's a problem, she can come
down here and see me herself.

560
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.010
Go ahead.

561
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:21.510
Take one in back.

562
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.570
I'll give you first time discount.

563
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:25.810
Maybe another time.

564
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.160
We can't go to Ash's short on account.

565
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.780
He said he'd pay Sunday.

566
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.680
It's not gonna fly with her.

567
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.236
But that means she's
moving away this weekend.

568
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.580
You know you shouldn't be asking.

569
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.300
Ash wants you to know, you know.

570
00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.540
Spencer, you're still hiring that shit.

571
00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.660
You're overreacting.

572
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.300
Give me the money.

573
00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.160
What are you gonna do?

574
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.260
Just give me the money.

575
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.020
Get us out of this fucking mess.

576
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:09.980
That's what I'm gonna do.

577
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.920
Hey, I need to borrow your car.

578
00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:14.940
I don't understand.

579
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.320
Did you go home right now, all right?

580
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:16.480
Really?

581
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.180
Don't answer the phone or the door.

582
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:18.560
Why?

583
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.180
We're talking to anybody but me.

584
00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.440
Whoa, what are you talking about?

585
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:22.566
I need you to stay clean, all right?

586
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:23.420
The fuck are you talking about?

587
00:48:23.421 --> 00:48:24.941
I need you shot for the next 48 hours.

588
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.360
What's happening in the 48 hours?

589
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.906
Listen, listen, listen, Spencer.

590
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:29.876
I'm gonna come for you
in a time's right, I promise.

591
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:30.380
Be ready to leave.

592
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.580
Yeah, what the fuck is going on?

593
00:48:31.581 --> 00:48:32.140
You hear me? Come on, let's go.

594
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.300
Trust me, let's go.

595
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:40.890
Fuck.

596
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.860
Hey.

597
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.740
I thought you'd swing by.

598
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.060
What are you doing here?

599
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.780
Oh, I brought lunch.

600
00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.140
Give Molly a break.

601
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:03.590
Checking on your butt?

602
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.520
Are you hungry?

603
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.040
Okay, if this stranger joins us.

604
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.100
I didn't know you were stopping by.

605
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.600
I was supposed to be surprised,
but I guess I got beat to the punch.

606
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:38.600
I was just telling Molly how much
you've changed since you got out.

607
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.640
I barely recognized you anymore.

608
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.120
I'm working on being a better me every day.

609
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.320
Well, that's good.

610
00:49:46.585 --> 00:49:47.700
Any job leads?

611
00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:50.540
He's been helping me out
with a few odds and ends.

612
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.860
All about board.

613
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.900
Something to get by until he
finds a more permanent position.

614
00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.840
We can't thank you
enough for all of your help.

615
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.931
I don't know how we
would've survived without you.

616
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.300
And the lunch was gonna be PB&J
today until you bought this food.

617
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.660
You can't have my favorite
growing boy eating scraps.

618
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:14.400
Gotta put meat on those bones so he
can go big and strong, like his daddy.

619
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:15.680
Right?

620
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.380
Right.

621
00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:21.160
I've been meaning to ask you.

622
00:50:22.235 --> 00:50:24.020
Neither of you talked to Graham recently?

623
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.620
It's been like two years from now.

624
00:50:29.315 --> 00:50:30.315
What about you, Neil?

625
00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.320
He's not much into talking these days.

626
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:36.840
It's not what I hear.

627
00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.320
I hear his mouth's been working overtime.

628
00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.980
News to me.

629
00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:54.450
Sorry, this is work.

630
00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:57.290
Hey.

631
00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.350
How did it go with our friend?

632
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:02.270
You were right.

633
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:03.950
The old man's in here with the DEA.

634
00:51:07.295 --> 00:51:08.430
Well, that's disappointing.

635
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.990
I was hoping things
would turn out differently.

636
00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:16.750
A little mixed up I need to handle.

637
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.770
I'm gonna have to leave
you guys to enjoy your meal.

638
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.710
I hope you like it.

639
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.830
Can I get a man with you outside?

640
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:26.410
Sure.

641
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:28.830
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:42.510
I wanna give you a heads up.

643
00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:44.450
We were about to rush in.

644
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:46.950
You wouldn't give up your cut.

645
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:50.270
Did he say why?

646
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:53.070
He said he settled with his Sunday.

647
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:54.790
Something about the docks.

648
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:59.210
If you want me to come his
back up, just say when and where.

649
00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:03.010
So eager to help all of a sudden.

650
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:06.910
It's for them.

651
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:09.790
It's all for them.

652
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:14.050
Well, we'll enjoy your family.

653
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.680
When he leaves, tell him.

654
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.440
You gave this guy a long leash.

655
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.760
Let me kill him.

656
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.580
I wanna know who he's talking to.

657
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.020
What about the brother?

658
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.840
How about friends in the FBI pay a visit?

659
00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:48.050
Okay.

660
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.750
Trapp, buddy.

661
00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.986
I need you to go to your room and
I need you to pack a sleepover bag.

662
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:53.750
Neil, you have no right to come in here.

663
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.570
Trapp, just do this one
thing for me, please.

664
00:52:55.571 --> 00:52:57.030
I am talking to you.

665
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.770
You cannot do this.

666
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.210
You cannot come and turn his life away.

667
00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:04.650
I'm cooperating with the DEA.

668
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:08.850
We're building the case against Ash.

669
00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:11.211
They're gonna relocate us.

670
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:13.110
New names.

671
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:14.310
New house.

672
00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:15.210
Everything.

673
00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.230
Then why aren't they here right now?

674
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.261
They want me to give them
something on her before they bring us in.

675
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.970
You don't have a deal with them.

676
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:23.990
No, no, not yet, but I will, okay?

677
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.890
This?

678
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.630
This is your master plan to win us facts,

679
00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.050
gamble with our lives, and
force us out of our home?

680
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.530
You can't keep going like this.

681
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.490
I have been doing fine without you.

682
00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:41.770
You've been scraping by, getting
handouts from a homicidal maniac.

683
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.890
Ash would never do anything to hurt us.

684
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:47.610
I saw her beat a guy
within an inch of his life.

685
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:52.570
This slit his throat
with a smile on her face.

686
00:53:52.571 --> 00:53:55.510
You've only seen the half of it.

687
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.430
The side she wants you to see.

688
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:01.450
The other side is a monster.

689
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.490
If she finds out what I'm doing,
she's coming after all of us.

690
00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.120
Listen, there's enough
here to get you started.

691
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.320
Okay, stop.

692
00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.200
Just take it.

693
00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.500
I know I want your money.

694
00:54:17.501 --> 00:54:19.060
It was never about the money.

695
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.760
I just wanted, I just wanted you.

696
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.080
Four broke, it didn't matter.

697
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.580
We just needed you here.

698
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.440
Please still do.

699
00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.260
I'm sorry.

700
00:54:54.765 --> 00:54:57.210
There was a time when I
thought we'd both end up here.

701
00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:01.310
It seemed inevitable.

702
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:07.190
I heard you're still trying
to shake down my father.

703
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.250
I always like to hedge my bets.

704
00:55:09.251 --> 00:55:12.910
Like I said before, you gotta
bring me something legit.

705
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.670
I got a hot tip on Ash done.

706
00:55:20.165 --> 00:55:24.360
Look man, I really need you to give
me and my family witness protection.

707
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.080
Her lessons in mentality
compromised my judgment.

708
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.940
Growing up, we were like family.

709
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.980
But it was my mistake.

710
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:36.970
Letting you live.

711
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:40.620
Delaying what I should have done years ago.

712
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.920
I know about your deal with the feds.

713
00:55:53.065 --> 00:55:55.720
And I'm gonna Bury
your entire fucking family.

714
00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.020
Your boys, your grandson, his mother.

715
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.080
There'll be no trace
of your bloodline left.

716
00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:05.940
Holy shit!

717
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:10.090
We ain't got no other man.

718
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:11.450
We only got five men.

719
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.130
If you don't get it now,
homie, you won't get it now.

720
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:17.650
Look, me, my anabetho, she
been praying for what needs.

721
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.470
Pray so long her knees started to bleed.

722
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.450
Real out here are six
bullets for any reason.

723
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:26.270
Spicy like them dumb boys
trying to change the seasons.

724
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.390
Truth is, I got a lead or I got a lead.

725
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:32.230
That's the only option
that we can't believe.

726
00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:35.130
Just to get some emotion
that we can breathe.

727
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.850
Hey, cuz I'm suffocating someone with me.

728
00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:40.110
Eh?

729
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:42.990
Took a smile, I'm coming for my share.

730
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.350
Somethin' bout this like this, I ran.

731
00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:48.450
Girl, I just want a grave.

732
00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.270
Suffocating someone with me.

733
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:53.870
Somethin' bout this like this, I ran.

734
00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:54.730
Fairness.

735
00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:57.150
Took a smile, I'm coming for my share.

736
00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:02.110
Come on.

737
00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.111
Come on.

738
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:06.220
Hold back.

739
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.040
Neil, we're at the hotel.

740
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720
I lost her.

741
00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:15.940
You lost who?

742
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.720
Spence.

743
00:58:18.115 --> 00:58:20.440
Tell me where you are and
we'll come get you right now.

744
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.700
Gee, Adam killed enough.

745
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.160
I fucking let it happen.

746
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.480
Okay, well what about the DEA?

747
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.060
What about your deal with the DEA?

748
00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.220
That deal's dead.

749
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.200
She got to him too.

750
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.760
There must be someone who can help.

751
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.260
What the fuck was that?

752
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:36.920
I want you to take my money.

753
00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:40.350
We'll just drive.

754
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.510
You know, when you were,
um, when you were gone,

755
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:51.330
for those two years, there
were times I thought of.

756
00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:56.630
picking up and leaving of taking
Trev and starting over somewhere new.

757
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:59.990
I even thought about it
this morning, but I didn't.

758
00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:01.310
I couldn't.

759
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.690
And you know why?

760
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:07.990
Because you belong with us, Neil.

761
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.180
We're in this together and
I don't care what it takes

762
00:59:20.181 --> 00:59:25.360
and I don't care what mistakes
you made, but don't forget about us.

763
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:07.010
Where's the blow from?

764
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:23.686
Look, I don't know what
you got yourself into,

765
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:25.350
but I know you can't
get out on your own.

766
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.450
We got good people in the major case squad.

767
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.130
Honest cops.

768
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.190
Let me reach out.

769
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:34.410
No.

770
01:00:34.735 --> 01:00:36.055
Someone dirty will catch a whiff.

771
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:39.130
Let this day's secret inside
those walls, you know that.

772
01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:42.910
What I know is you don't
stand a chance of walking

773
01:00:42.911 --> 01:00:44.006
away from this without
the law on your side.

774
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.370
There are no sides.

775
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:47.510
Can't you see that?

776
01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:49.331
She's got everybody in her pocket.

777
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320
Why don't you just go?

778
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.560
Hit the road, you, Molly, Trev.

779
01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.260
And let's leave you one
hour and for the rest of my life.

780
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.530
Where are they now?

781
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:08.870
Up north.

782
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.490
Twin lakes, valley end.

783
01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:13.290
Can you go up there?

784
01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:14.590
Keep an eye out.

785
01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.490
I have to go finish what she started.

786
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320
Sally.

787
01:01:42.185 --> 01:01:43.540
I have something for you.

788
01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.500
So?

789
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.820
There's an informant in your crew.

790
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.400
You and Sean talk in the fire bowl.

791
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.980
They follow the cruiser to a motel
where they're hiding his family.

792
01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.760
Now, I know you're
taking from the Russians.

793
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720
That's your big play.

794
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.660
And for this info, I want
their next shipment.

795
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.440
Like before.

796
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.800
Free of charge.

797
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:21.320
Here.

798
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.880
Be solid.

799
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.060
Which motel?

800
01:02:26.061 --> 01:02:46.500
How are we gonna get something to eat?

801
01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:49.980
We're gonna sell a vending
machine on the other side.

802
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800
Can I come with you?

803
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:59.651
I won't let him out of my sight.

804
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.600
I promise.

805
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:33.910
Some chips?

806
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.110
Now, can I have a coat?

807
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.270
No coat?

808
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:39.670
Absolutely.

809
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:53.650
You little shaker!

810
01:03:53.651 --> 01:03:54.651
Wake up!

811
01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.380
Fuck off.

812
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:14.570
No!

813
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:17.950
Where the fuck is he?

814
01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:20.470
He's gonna fuck himself right now.

815
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.990
Go to hell.

816
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:23.350
I probably will.

817
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.930
Molly, we got company.

818
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:31.230
Kill them.

819
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:32.430
Coming in.

820
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960
Drop your weapon.

821
01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.860
Drop it!

822
01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:59.140
Fuck!

823
01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.400
I'm FBI.

824
01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.820
You can't kill me.

825
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.220
Fuck you.

826
01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:19.290
She's conscious and stable for right now.

827
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:20.450
I'm sorry.

828
01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.850
I stepped out for a
minute when I came back.

829
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:26.751
You were right. There are no sides.

830
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:28.710
Look, man.

831
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:30.410
Whatever you need,

832
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:33.490
I got you.

833
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:46.630
I'll come with, back you up.

834
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400
Just keep my boy safe.

835
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:25.870
If you've come here to
shylock money for your boss...

836
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:27.711
You're gonna pay the
price one way or another?

837
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:29.670
Money?

838
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:30.930
Or blood?

839
01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:32.930
Is there a threat?

840
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.310
It's a reality.

841
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.550
And I don't run errands
for Ash Dunn anymore.

842
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:40.650
So you've came here to beg for a job?

843
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:43.450
I came here to negotiate a sale.

844
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:45.890
You can buy me.

845
01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:49.970
And what would my investment in you yield?

846
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:53.030
Money or blood?

847
01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.410
Both.

848
01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:56.310
Who's blood?

849
01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:58.790
You know who.

850
01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:02.330
The same person is gonna try and
steal your shipment again tonight.

851
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:05.230
I'm not shy of me.

852
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.830
I'm not shy of you.

853
01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.670
I'm not shy of you.

854
01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:14.850
How well?

855
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:41.350
Ash, thank you for coming and
helping ensure the safety of my shipment.

856
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:45.990
Load them up.

857
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.720
Everything's in order?

858
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.100
In our payment?

859
01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.260
I could give you the money.

860
01:09:05.155 --> 01:09:07.840
I have something else
that might interest you more.

861
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.740
One of your men came to me today.

862
01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:14.320
He offered me to kill you
in exchange for money.

863
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.700
And I am offering him to you.

864
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.640
In return, I'll owe you
nothing from now on.

865
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.080
Do we have a deal?

866
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.700
Where is he?

867
01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:35.220
Waiting for you at your
warehouse, shall we?

868
01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.100
We shall.

869
01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:23.890
What?

870
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.330
This bitch trying to back out.

871
01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:30.010
She killed the deal?

872
01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:33.010
Nah.

873
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.170
Mm, Michelle, what's up?

874
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:36.850
We gonna hook.

875
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:38.270
Let's roll.

876
01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760
He's here?

877
01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.460
Played up in the truck.

878
01:11:15.461 --> 01:11:17.700
The fuck didn't you say
so back at the docks?

879
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.620
Too much noise is no good for business.

880
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.820
Here you can do whatever you want with him.

881
01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560
He's yours.

882
01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.980
Take him.

883
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:28.060
I got this.

884
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.140
Deal zone!

885
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:06.430
You wanna play?

886
01:15:07.995 --> 01:15:09.770
Let's do it.

887
01:17:48.140 --> 01:18:09.010
Come on.

888
01:18:09.011 --> 01:18:10.011
You're hit!

889
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:13.630
Just the scratch.

890
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:16.150
It's a lot of blood, but just the scratch.

891
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.500
Where you about a car?

892
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:12.651
I don't know what to say, man.

893
01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.420
What's this?

894
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.620
Call it in.

895
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.700
Go get your career back.

896
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:32.711
You'll understand it when you see it.

897
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:56.030
Where should we go?

898
01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.440
Home.
