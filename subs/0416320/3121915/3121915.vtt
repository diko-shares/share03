00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.825
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

2
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.078
saw deeply into life.

3
00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.082
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

4
00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.211
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

5
00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:31.965
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

6
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.845
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

7
00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.725
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

8
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.229
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

9
00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.110
Sorry.

10
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.117
Mr. Townsend.

11
00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.249
Just this way.

12
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.502
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

13
00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:12.047
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

14
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.133
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

15
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:15.759
Yeah, so I see.

16
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.887
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

17
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.681
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

18
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:24.059
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

19
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.438
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

20
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.315
You have to really want it.

21
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.317
Not that I have their talent.

22
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.445
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

23
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.406
And you want to live in London?

24
00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:40.534
Very much. Very much.

25
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.829
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

26
00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:45.789
You can begin this weekend?

27
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.209
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:53.338
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

29
00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:56.216
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

30
00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.343
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

31
00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.846
You can just open it up, get your kip.

32
00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.056
Kitchen just through there.

33
00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.476
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

34
00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.853
All that stuff.

35
00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.355
Lovely view, not overlooked.

36
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.357
So it's all good.

37
00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:14.985
This is 225 a week?

38
00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.739
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

39
00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.616
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

40
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.493
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

41
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.746
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

42
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.832
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

43
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.627
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

44
00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.143
Very good.

45
00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.366
Chris Wilton.

46
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.159
This is Tom Hewett.

47
00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.245
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

48
00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.038
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

49
00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.791
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

50
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:14.044
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

51
00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:17.381
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

52
00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.007
Don't worry, it comes back.

53
00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.718
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

54
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.095
OK.

55
00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.222
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.391
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

57
00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:43.156
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

58
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.534
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

59
00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.411
you held your own more than admirably.

60
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:48.912
For a while.

61
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.540
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

62
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.375
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

63
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.919
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.879
Get your dirty great forehand off.

65
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.300
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

66
00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.136
So, do you need a lift after this?

67
00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:07.806
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some CDs.

68
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.560
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

69
00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.770
And they'll have a decent opera section?

70
00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.897
Opera? You like opera, really?

71
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.190
I love opera.

72
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.402
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Covent Garden.

73
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.321
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

74
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.781
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

75
00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:27.826
To the opera?

76
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.329
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

77
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.914
It's La bloody Traviata.

78
00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:36.043
My God. I'd love to.

79
00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.962
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

80
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.590
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

81
00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:45.844
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

82
00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:48.972
So?

83
00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.059
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

84
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.186
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

85
00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:57.105
- This is Chris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

86
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.107
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

87
00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.943
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

88
00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.195
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

89
00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:05.947
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

90
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.991
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.619
- This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

92
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.829
- I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

93
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:07.175
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

94
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.387
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

95
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.808
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

96
00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:18.437
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

97
00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.189
Frighteningly so at times. But...

98
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:24.276
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

99
00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:27.279
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

100
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.282
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

101
00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:34.703
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

102
00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.931
Chlo-Chlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Chris for a bit?

103
00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.850
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

104
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:59.102
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

105
00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:02.189
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

106
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.691
It'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

107
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.486
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

108
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.363
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Chop-chop.

109
00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.366
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

110
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.328
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

111
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.246
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

112
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.998
OK.

113
00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.311
Was I dreadful?

114
00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.147
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

115
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.068
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

116
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.529
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

117
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.448
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

118
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.451
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

119
00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:59.579
It all came so easy at first.

120
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.207
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

121
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.209
I mean, it's OK for now,

122
00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.045
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

123
00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.964
I'd like to do something with my life.

124
00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:12.592
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

125
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:15.929
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

126
00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:17.722
I love it.

127
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.225
It's so exciting and alive.

128
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.602
I've never seen so much art or theater.

129
00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.854
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

130
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.607
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

131
00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:31.361
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

132
00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:32.696
That'd be great.

133
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.741
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

134
00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.577
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

135
00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.371
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

136
00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:44.124
But actually,
I did read something about the...

137
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.501
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

138
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:50.463
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

139
00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:52.716
You're very kind to offer this.

140
00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.218
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

141
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.970
OK, it's a deal.

142
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.389
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

143
00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.016
I can do that.

144
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.519
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

145
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.355
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

146
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.274
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

147
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.527
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

148
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:12.337
So who's my next victim?

149
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:14.673
You?

150
00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.300
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

151
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.845
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

152
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.307
What did I walk into?

153
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.612
What did I walk into?

154
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:40.990
It's like this.

155
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.743
- May I?
- Please.

156
00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:49.999
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

157
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.880
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

158
00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:58.091
The story of my life.

159
00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.592
So, tell me,

160
00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.470
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

161
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:04.764
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

162
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.898
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

163
00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:19.487
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

164
00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:26.870
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

165
00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.914
Is it off-putting?

166
00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:34.377
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

167
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:38.923
There you are.

168
00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:41.050
I wanted to introduce you
to Chris Wilton.

169
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:44.179
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancée.

170
00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:48.433
So, you're the tennis pro.

171
00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.560
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

172
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.937
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

173
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.815
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

174
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.901
He's made a living out of hustling.

175
00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.945
I'll be ready for you next time.

176
00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:06.409
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.460
She's quite something, isn't she?

178
00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:20.715
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

179
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.842
Jesus, yeah, six months!

180
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.345
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

181
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.555
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

182
00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:30.225
...one thing led to another.

183
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.062
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

184
00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:35.605
that I'm serious about her, but...

185
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:36.731
To be honest with you,

186
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.108
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

187
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:42.445
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

188
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.614
Especially an American one.

189
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.576
But I am crazy about her.

190
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:52.330
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

191
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.374
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

192
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.002
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

193
00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:01.381
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

194
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.882
These afternoons have been great.

195
00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:47.886
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

196
00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:49.554
Yes, it's fun.

197
00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:52.307
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

198
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.519
Do you need money?

199
00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.396
God, no.

200
00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.273
No, I'm fine.

201
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:03.026
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

202
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:12.702
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

203
00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:33.222
Shall we go to your place or mine?

204
00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.600
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

205
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:39.604
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

206
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.877
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

207
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.589
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

208
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.384
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

209
00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:12.345
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

210
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:14.639
Well, I find him very likeable.

211
00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:18.226
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

212
00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:22.522
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

213
00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:24.607
Can't we do something for him?

214
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.985
A place in one of
your companies or something?

215
00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:28.361
Has he expressed a desire?

216
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:32.115
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

217
00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.409
He really wants
to make something of his life.

218
00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:36.536
Chloe, be careful.

219
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.540
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

220
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:43.501
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

221
00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.420
She's spoilt and temperamental.

222
00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:47.380
She's an actress, they're emotional.

223
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.675
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

224
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.928
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

225
00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:56.431
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

226
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.529
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

227
00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:14.115
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

228
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.034
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

229
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.036
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

230
00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:24.292
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

231
00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.002
Did you say anything?

232
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:30.423
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

233
00:17:30.507 --> 00:17:33.301
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

234
00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:36.054
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

235
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.057
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

236
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.560
Thanks.

237
00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:44.687
What do you think?

238
00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:47.690
I'm gonna have to think about it.

239
00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:50.568
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

240
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:57.450
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

241
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.203
I don't know, really.

242
00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:04.707
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

243
00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:06.542
I think it is.

244
00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.962
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

245
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:13.716
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

246
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.968
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

247
00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:19.931
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

248
00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.100
It's not exactly office work.

249
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:25.603
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

250
00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:26.729
To?

251
00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:30.733
To a bigger job, more responsibility,

252
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.736
greater earning potential, I don't know.

253
00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:38.866
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

254
00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:41.244
Of course.

255
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:44.455
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

256
00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:47.625
I've always admired
men like your father.

257
00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:50.128
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

258
00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.255
Enjoying his fortune.

259
00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.508
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

260
00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:58.970
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

261
00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:00.847
He's a very generous man.

262
00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:04.642
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

263
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.232
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:13.151
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

265
00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.028
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

266
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:19.740
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

267
00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:22.243
I will. I promise.

268
00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:25.371
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

269
00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:26.664
Hi, guys.

270
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.125
Hello.

271
00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:35.548
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

272
00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:39.302
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExCeL.

273
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:41.429
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

274
00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.306
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

275
00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:44.557
Oh, God. Shut up.

276
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.184
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

277
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.437
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

278
00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:53.316
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

279
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.651
I want an Aston Martin.

280
00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:57.570
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

281
00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:01.073
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

282
00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:03.201
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

283
00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:06.287
taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

284
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.083
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

285
00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:14.337
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

286
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.465
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

287
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:20.176
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

288
00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:23.596
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

289
00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.432
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

290
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.851
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

291
00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:30.853
Nothing to start?

292
00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:32.563
Oh, I think the wine list.

293
00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.067
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

294
00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:38.986
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

295
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.614
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

296
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.449
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

297
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:46.452
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

298
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:47.995
"So-so."

299
00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:52.083
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

300
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:54.085
He'll have the blinis.

301
00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:57.880
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

302
00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:59.882
He was kind of austere.

303
00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:02.093
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

304
00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:03.135
Oh, Christ.

305
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.137
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

306
00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:09.642
God. Sorry, but it just
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

307
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.020
What were you saying about Hedley?

308
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.773
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

309
00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:17.650
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

310
00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.361
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

311
00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.239
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

312
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:27.034
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

313
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.745
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

314
00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.415
It was a commercial, not a movie.

315
00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:35.293
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

316
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:39.046
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

317
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.548
Oh, you just need a break.

318
00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:42.758
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

319
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.927
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

320
00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:46.762
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

321
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:50.057
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

322
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.310
I mean, it seems scientists are...

323
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:56.314
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

324
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.317
No purpose, no design.

325
00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:01.944
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

326
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.946
And I envy you for it.

327
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:07.074
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

328
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.785
" Despair is the path
of least resistance."

329
00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:12.204
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

330
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.582
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

331
00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:15.958
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

332
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.668
Can we change the subject, please?

333
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:21.047
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

334
00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:22.798
No, I was...

335
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:27.470
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

336
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:31.974
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

337
00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:34.685
Not that I'm ever
going back to Colorado.

338
00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:36.062
Ever.

339
00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:38.606
Have you decided on a wine?

340
00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:42.610
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

341
00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:44.820
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

342
00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:46.113
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

343
00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:49.617
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

344
00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:50.993
Hi, Alan. How are you?

345
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:54.622
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

346
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:57.875
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

347
00:22:58.001 --> 00:22:59.960
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

348
00:23:00.003 --> 00:23:02.713
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

349
00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:04.507
Now, if you're OK with the package,

350
00:23:04.591 --> 00:23:06.759
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

351
00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:08.636
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

352
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.763
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

353
00:23:10.847 --> 00:23:11.764
And Rod.

354
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.099
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

355
00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:14.517
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

356
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.732
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken that job.

357
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:24.360
It's such good news.

358
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:28.030
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

359
00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:30.616
Wow. Thank you.

360
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.162
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

361
00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:39.041
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

362
00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:42.753
- ...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

363
00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:44.797
It has some beautiful arias on it.

364
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:46.549
And his voice expresses

365
00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:49.009
everything that's tragic about life.

366
00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:52.763
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

367
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.561
I love it.

368
00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:04.692
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

369
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.321
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

370
00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.949
Puligny-Montrachet.

371
00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:14.326
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

372
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.703
Now I'm addicted.

373
00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:18.581
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

374
00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:20.332
but I told them we're busy.

375
00:24:23.044 --> 00:24:25.045
But we have no plans.

376
00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:27.089
Well, no special plans.

377
00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:29.967
I thought we said we'd stay in?

378
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:33.596
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

379
00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:35.306
We could've joined them.

380
00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:37.850
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

381
00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:43.230
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

382
00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:47.359
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

383
00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:49.737
Well, shall I call them?

384
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:54.450
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

385
00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.745
Well...

386
00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:00.748
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

387
00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:03.334
The wine, the opera.

388
00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:06.378
Absolutely.

389
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.765
I just figured...

390
00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:21.393
We can stay in any... any night, and...

391
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.522
...they're free and suggested a film.

392
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:25.898
What's the film?

393
00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:28.609
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

394
00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:32.530
I am in the mood for a film.

395
00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:39.787
Thank you so much, fella.

396
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:45.000
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

397
00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:47.169
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

398
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.798
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

399
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.300
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

400
00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.302
Where is she?

401
00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:58.806
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

402
00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.016
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

403
00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.685
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

404
00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:05.813
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

405
00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:08.440
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

406
00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:12.278
Everybody likes you at work.

407
00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:16.949
Papa says he's heard great things.

408
00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:21.704
You're a very clever boy.

409
00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:40.973
Hey!

410
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:42.725
Hey.

411
00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:44.351
- Hi.
- How are you?

412
00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:48.105
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

413
00:26:48.231 --> 00:26:50.983
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

414
00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:53.485
It's vicuña.

415
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:54.987
- Vicuña.
- Vicuña?

416
00:26:55.071 --> 00:26:56.322
- Yeah.
- Right.

417
00:26:56.364 --> 00:26:57.448
Where are you going?

418
00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.200
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

419
00:27:00.243 --> 00:27:01.243
- Why?
- So...

420
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:03.829
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

421
00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:08.459
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

422
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:12.129
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

423
00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:14.632
- Are you walk...? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

424
00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:19.219
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

425
00:27:19.262 --> 00:27:23.515
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

426
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:26.644
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

427
00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:30.356
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

428
00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:32.524
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

429
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:33.984
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

430
00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:36.612
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

431
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.907
Have you ever tried yoga?

432
00:27:40.617 --> 00:27:42.743
- No.
- No?

433
00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:39.967
Hi.

434
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:41.969
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

435
00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:44.847
- How was it?
- Blew that.

436
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.182
It just works, you know, at home, but...

437
00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:50.853
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

438
00:28:51.354 --> 00:28:53.188
- ...in the end.
- You will. You will.

439
00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:54.565
Yeah.

440
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:56.817
You know what,

441
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.737
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

442
00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:01.238
- ...a little bit.
- Sure.

443
00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.365
- OK.
- This way.

444
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:16.712
What was I saying?

445
00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:23.510
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

446
00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:26.346
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

447
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.724
You should see my sister, she's...

448
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:33.979
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

449
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:36.774
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

450
00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:41.403
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

451
00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:43.280
My sister...

452
00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:47.117
...is classically beautiful.

453
00:29:49.412 --> 00:29:52.247
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

454
00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:57.169
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

455
00:29:58.922 --> 00:30:00.881
It's just a joke.

456
00:30:01.674 --> 00:30:03.425
What did your father do?

457
00:30:05.428 --> 00:30:08.263
He... left.

458
00:30:09.432 --> 00:30:11.934
And never sent any money.

459
00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:14.311
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

460
00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:17.147
- No?
- No.

461
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:20.567
Her problem was that she drank.

462
00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:24.905
How did you meet Tom?

463
00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:30.077
We met at a party.

464
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.328
He...

465
00:30:31.454 --> 00:30:33.163
...saw me across the room

466
00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:37.459
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

467
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:38.961
And I...

468
00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:40.838
I liked him right off, you know.

469
00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:42.714
I thought...

470
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.801
Well, I think he's very handsome.

471
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.094
Don't you?

472
00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.971
Very.

473
00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:51.306
And he asked you to marry him?

474
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:55.602
Well, he...

475
00:30:55.687 --> 00:31:00.482
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

476
00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:02.484
What did I know
about that kind of life?

477
00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:05.696
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Colorado.

478
00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:07.197
But...

479
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:11.743
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

480
00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:15.497
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

481
00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:18.000
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

482
00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:21.086
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

483
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:23.589
It's such an inbred family. It's...

484
00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:26.008
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

485
00:31:30.597 --> 00:31:33.015
I thought he was very handsome.

486
00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:36.018
You know, and I told you I was just...

487
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:39.521
I was overwhelmed with attention.

488
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.860
So, what about you and Chloe?

489
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:49.865
She's very sweet.

490
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.912
She is very sweet.

491
00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:59.166
And she wants to marry you.

492
00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:01.877
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

493
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.171
No. No, it's different.

494
00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:07.674
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

495
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.677
...are being groomed.

496
00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:12.429
You mark my words.

497
00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:15.891
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

498
00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:18.644
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

499
00:32:18.686 --> 00:32:20.187
But...

500
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:27.319
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

501
00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:30.572
And how am I going to blow it?

502
00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.578
By making a pass at me.

503
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.083
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

504
00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:45.712
Men always seem to wonder.

505
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.842
They think I'd be
something very special.

506
00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:52.844
And are you?

507
00:32:56.057 --> 00:32:58.850
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

508
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.357
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

509
00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:14.199
I've had too much to drink.

510
00:33:15.702 --> 00:33:17.703
Can you get me a cab?

511
00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:19.746
Sure.

512
00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.018
Thank you.

513
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.103
You were driving a bit fast,

514
00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:44.646
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

515
00:33:44.897 --> 00:33:47.607
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

516
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.650
Oh, hi.

517
00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:49.901
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

518
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:52.029
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

519
00:33:52.113 --> 00:33:53.530
Oh, he's so sweet.

520
00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:55.532
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

521
00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:57.534
It should have dissipated fully already.

522
00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.870
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

523
00:33:59.912 --> 00:34:01.538
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

524
00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:04.499
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

525
00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:07.294
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

526
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:09.171
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

527
00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:11.298
You're so beautiful.

528
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.595
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

529
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.972
that the company would pay for?

530
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.599
I don't know.

531
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:27.355
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

532
00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:29.483
And the beginning of next year

533
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:32.486
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

534
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.490
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

535
00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:39.367
Plus, there are a number of perks...

536
00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:43.497
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

537
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:46.124
We had been focusing on someone else...

538
00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:50.504
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

539
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.007
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

540
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.634
I'd hate to disappoint you.

541
00:34:56.886 --> 00:34:58.386
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on, Chris...

542
00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:00.514
We're nearly ready.

543
00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.974
- I'll bring a gun for Chris.
- Thanks, Tom.

544
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:08.897
Never mind, fella.

545
00:35:09.023 --> 00:35:12.609
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

546
00:35:12.652 --> 00:35:15.529
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

547
00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:18.115
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

548
00:35:18.157 --> 00:35:20.117
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

549
00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:22.369
- Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

550
00:35:22.411 --> 00:35:23.411
Come on, Chloe.

551
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.250
Hi, darling.

552
00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:29.918
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

553
00:35:30.002 --> 00:35:31.294
No.

554
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.171
How did your audition go?

555
00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:36.508
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

556
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:39.427
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

557
00:35:39.512 --> 00:35:42.305
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

558
00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:46.893
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

559
00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:51.189
So, how long do you keep it up?

560
00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:55.068
How long?

561
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:58.446
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

562
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:03.076
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that...?

563
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.787
To try something else?

564
00:36:06.164 --> 00:36:08.540
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

565
00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:09.583
I'm not saying that.

566
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.335
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

567
00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:16.089
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

568
00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:20.343
"ls this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

569
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:22.679
Well, I do ask myself that.

570
00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.848
See? It's only logical, Tom.

571
00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:27.225
Especially for a woman.

572
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:30.103
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

573
00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:32.981
and as you get older and time passes,

574
00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:35.317
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

575
00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:38.862
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

576
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.490
I'm not saying now.

577
00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:46.494
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

578
00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:49.623
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

579
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.209
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

580
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:54.461
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

581
00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:56.504
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

582
00:36:56.631 --> 00:37:00.508
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

583
00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:02.010
...innuendos.

584
00:37:02.094 --> 00:37:04.721
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

585
00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:06.765
Those that have it, know it right off.

586
00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.392
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

587
00:37:09.518 --> 00:37:12.354
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

588
00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.397
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

589
00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:16.358
Excuse me.

590
00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:17.984
Nola.

591
00:37:18.027 --> 00:37:20.278
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

592
00:37:20.363 --> 00:37:23.281
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

593
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:25.533
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

594
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:29.162
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

595
00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.489
I was looking for you.

596
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.618
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

597
00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:52.704
I don't mean to intrude.

598
00:38:53.873 --> 00:38:55.832
I need a drink.

599
00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:58.626
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

600
00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:00.754
- Do I?
- Yeah.

601
00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:03.131
- Confident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

602
00:39:03.215 --> 00:39:04.841
You shouldn't have followed me here.

603
00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:06.885
Do you feel guilty?

604
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.221
Do you?

605
00:39:18.147 --> 00:39:20.148
We can't do this.

606
00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.859
I know.

607
00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.035
This can't lead anyplace.

608
00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:48.862
Hello.

609
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:51.990
Darling, I think it's for you.

610
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.826
But take it outside.

611
00:41:10.384 --> 00:41:12.469
Well, there's hope, at least.

612
00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:14.762
When's the callback?

613
00:41:16.765 --> 00:41:18.975
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

614
00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:22.270
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

615
00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:26.107
Yeah. OK.

616
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.275
Bye.

617
00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:30.028
Why have you been so cold to me?

618
00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:32.864
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

619
00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:35.116
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

620
00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:37.535
you've been distant, evasive.

621
00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.787
I don't want to encourage anything.

622
00:41:39.788 --> 00:41:42.165
What happened, happened, Chris.

623
00:41:42.249 --> 00:41:45.168
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

624
00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:47.921
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

625
00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:50.757
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

626
00:41:50.799 --> 00:41:54.886
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

627
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:58.181
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

628
00:41:58.807 --> 00:42:01.935
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

629
00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:04.812
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

630
00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:06.189
We had our moment.

631
00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:08.775
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

632
00:42:08.817 --> 00:42:11.069
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

633
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.072
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

634
00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.449
Chris, forget it. It's over.

635
00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:32.090
Thanks. Henry!

636
00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:34.842
- Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

637
00:42:34.843 --> 00:42:36.427
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

638
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.721
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

639
00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:40.557
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

640
00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:42.350
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

641
00:42:42.434 --> 00:42:44.811
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

642
00:42:44.853 --> 00:42:47.480
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

643
00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:50.233
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

644
00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:52.068
I just couldn't stand it.

645
00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:54.487
No. No, I heard you went into business.

646
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:56.739
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

647
00:42:56.865 --> 00:42:59.242
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

648
00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:01.869
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

649
00:43:01.954 --> 00:43:03.496
Family's got nothing but money.

650
00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:06.833
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

651
00:43:06.875 --> 00:43:07.959
Hey, look, I understand.

652
00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:10.712
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

653
00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:13.339
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

654
00:43:13.382 --> 00:43:14.882
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

655
00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:16.884
I always admired
your game though, you know?

656
00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:18.386
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

657
00:43:18.387 --> 00:43:20.013
Cool under pressure, but creative.

658
00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:22.265
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

659
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:23.766
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

660
00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:25.643
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

661
00:43:25.728 --> 00:43:27.645
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

662
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:30.023
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

663
00:43:30.149 --> 00:43:31.399
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

664
00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:33.234
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

665
00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:34.986
- Give me your number.
- Certainly.

666
00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:38.031
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

667
00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:40.408
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

668
00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:41.659
So good to see you, Henry.

669
00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.119
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

670
00:43:43.162 --> 00:43:44.537
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

671
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:46.664
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

672
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:47.790
- ...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

673
00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:49.751
- All right.
- Bye.

674
00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.169
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

675
00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:54.547
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth...?

676
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.549
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

677
00:43:56.675 --> 00:43:59.177
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

678
00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.261
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

679
00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.555
- Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

680
00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:04.682
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

681
00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.768
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

682
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:07.810
Stop it.

683
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:09.937
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

684
00:44:10.022 --> 00:44:11.814
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

685
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.066
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

686
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:16.569
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

687
00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.946
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

688
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:22.075
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

689
00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.410
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

690
00:44:24.453 --> 00:44:25.828
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

691
00:44:25.954 --> 00:44:28.039
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

692
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:29.457
I appreciate that.

693
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:10.081
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

694
00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:16.838
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

695
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.006
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

696
00:45:19.007 --> 00:45:21.008
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

697
00:45:21.135 --> 00:45:22.510
It was all her fault, you know.

698
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:25.346
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

699
00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:27.390
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

700
00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:29.892
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

701
00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:31.978
All men who see you want to attack you.

702
00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.273
Isn't that right, Christopher?

703
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.900
Oh, God, are you all right?

704
00:45:38.777 --> 00:45:40.278
I'm fine.

705
00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.780
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

706
00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:48.661
I now pronounce you man and wife.

707
00:45:48.787 --> 00:45:50.788
You may kiss the bride.

708
00:46:06.805 --> 00:46:08.806
Oh, my God.

709
00:46:08.891 --> 00:46:11.142
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

710
00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:14.187
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

711
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.189
There's another bedroom through there.

712
00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.274
The bathroom and a kitchen.

713
00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:20.318
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

714
00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:23.446
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

715
00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:27.200
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

716
00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:29.202
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

717
00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:34.081
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

718
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:36.334
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

719
00:46:36.418 --> 00:46:38.336
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

720
00:46:41.215 --> 00:46:43.591
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

721
00:46:43.675 --> 00:46:45.676
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

722
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.722
I want you to make me pregnant.

723
00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:54.101
Chloe... We discussed this.

724
00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:56.103
It's very quick.

725
00:46:56.188 --> 00:46:59.232
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

726
00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:02.985
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

727
00:47:05.113 --> 00:47:08.115
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

728
00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:17.583
Hey! Where are you?

729
00:47:18.877 --> 00:47:20.878
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

730
00:47:21.964 --> 00:47:23.631
Not good.

731
00:47:25.634 --> 00:47:27.593
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

732
00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.762
What?

733
00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:32.265
Well, Nola and I...

734
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:34.141
...broke up.

735
00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:36.394
- No!
- Yeah.

736
00:47:36.478 --> 00:47:38.771
Or, I should say, I called it off.

737
00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:42.400
I thought you were gonna get married.

738
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.652
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

739
00:47:44.736 --> 00:47:47.280
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

740
00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:50.533
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

741
00:47:50.617 --> 00:47:52.243
who's her main candidate.

742
00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:54.161
God, no.

743
00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:58.040
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

744
00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:01.544
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

745
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.046
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

746
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:07.049
...I've met someone else.

747
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:09.135
- No!
- Yeah.

748
00:48:09.177 --> 00:48:13.431
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

749
00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:16.893
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

750
00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:20.187
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

751
00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:23.316
You know what I mean.

752
00:48:41.835 --> 00:48:44.712
The number you are calling
is not available.

753
00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:49.091
The number you are calling
is not available.

754
00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:06.484
Excuse me.

755
00:49:06.568 --> 00:49:08.986
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

756
00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:12.865
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

757
00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:18.371
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

758
00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:22.208
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

759
00:49:29.383 --> 00:49:32.093
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

760
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.971
Just business.

761
00:49:39.267 --> 00:49:42.103
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

762
00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.647
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

763
00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.859
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

764
00:49:49.736 --> 00:49:51.904
OK, I can take a hint.

765
00:49:56.159 --> 00:50:00.663
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

766
00:50:00.747 --> 00:50:02.123
Look...

767
00:50:02.916 --> 00:50:04.542
...it'll happen.

768
00:50:04.626 --> 00:50:07.044
I'm just really tired.

769
00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.422
Kiss.

770
00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:15.928
Sweet dreams.

771
00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:24.186
I now pronounce you man and wife.

772
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:26.397
You may kiss the bride.

773
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.536
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

774
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.541
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

775
00:50:45.584 --> 00:50:46.834
I know.

776
00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:50.171
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

777
00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:53.215
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

778
00:50:53.341 --> 00:50:55.301
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

779
00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:58.846
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

780
00:50:58.847 --> 00:51:00.848
I want my own children.

781
00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:02.725
This one?

782
00:51:04.186 --> 00:51:05.102
Sort of...

783
00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:07.688
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

784
00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:08.939
Really?

785
00:51:08.982 --> 00:51:10.858
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

786
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:12.985
Her and her husband
just found each other.

787
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.072
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

788
00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:18.115
and it just works like a charm.

789
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.369
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

790
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:25.247
- God...
- I know, it's great.

791
00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:28.334
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

792
00:51:29.002 --> 00:51:31.962
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

793
00:51:32.005 --> 00:51:34.131
If I have to work all night.

794
00:51:34.216 --> 00:51:35.132
OK.

795
00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:37.384
Thank you. Thanks.

796
00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:52.149
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

797
00:52:00.033 --> 00:52:01.283
Thanks.

798
00:52:03.036 --> 00:52:04.870
Are you OK, sir?

799
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.751
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

800
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.421
No, not really.

801
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:19.051
Oh, Christ!

802
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:21.053
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

803
00:52:21.179 --> 00:52:23.180
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

804
00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:25.558
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

805
00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.184
Not before.

806
00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:29.019
Good night.

807
00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:24.241
- Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

808
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:26.118
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

809
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.620
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

810
00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:29.997
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

811
00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:31.081
Yeah?

812
00:53:31.124 --> 00:53:32.875
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

813
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:34.877
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

814
00:53:34.961 --> 00:53:35.961
Why?

815
00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:38.881
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

816
00:53:39.007 --> 00:53:41.634
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

817
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760
I'm coming.

818
00:53:42.844 --> 00:53:44.386
- OK.
- OK.

819
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.698
Hello.

820
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.909
What a surprise.

821
00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.327
I...

822
00:54:50.412 --> 00:54:54.164
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

823
00:54:54.207 --> 00:54:57.918
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

824
00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:00.587
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

825
00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:04.925
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

826
00:55:06.428 --> 00:55:08.178
I looked for you.

827
00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:10.097
For what?

828
00:55:11.224 --> 00:55:13.225
You're still so angry.

829
00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:18.230
Where are you living?

830
00:55:19.107 --> 00:55:21.608
In town. Why?

831
00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:24.570
You live alone?

832
00:55:24.612 --> 00:55:28.115
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

833
00:55:29.617 --> 00:55:31.618
Can I meet you for a drink?

834
00:55:31.703 --> 00:55:33.579
Talk?

835
00:55:35.123 --> 00:55:38.000
Where can I reach you? Come on.

836
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:41.253
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

837
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:43.380
Look who I bumped into.

838
00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:45.632
- Hi.
- Hi.

839
00:55:45.633 --> 00:55:48.260
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

840
00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:50.596
- You look great.
- Thanks.

841
00:55:51.264 --> 00:55:53.349
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

842
00:55:53.391 --> 00:55:56.518
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

843
00:55:56.644 --> 00:55:59.271
Yeah. They've got a baby.

844
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:01.482
You know Tom, all settled down.

845
00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:04.151
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

846
00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:06.528
This is my friend Carol.
This is Nola.

847
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:07.780
- Hi.
- Hi.

848
00:56:08.406 --> 00:56:11.408
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

849
00:56:11.493 --> 00:56:14.536
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

850
00:56:14.662 --> 00:56:16.997
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

851
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.792
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

852
00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:21.293
Say your phone number.

853
00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.671
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

854
00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:26.423
- Chris...
- Please.

855
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.550
Say your phone number.

856
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:36.809
02079460996.

857
00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.770
I'll call you.

858
00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.022
Bye.

859
00:56:45.568 --> 00:56:47.569
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

860
00:56:47.695 --> 00:56:49.571
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

861
00:56:49.697 --> 00:56:52.324
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

862
00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:54.535
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

863
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:55.911
It's OK, John.

864
00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:57.788
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

865
00:56:57.831 --> 00:56:59.581
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

866
00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:02.209
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

867
00:57:02.293 --> 00:57:03.460
- OK.
- See you at home.

868
00:57:03.545 --> 00:57:04.461
Bye.

869
00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:40.122
You have a very charming flat.

870
00:57:40.206 --> 00:57:43.000
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

871
00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:47.880
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

872
00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:50.716
I mean, it's not perfect.

873
00:57:50.758 --> 00:57:53.760
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

874
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:55.888
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

875
00:57:56.764 --> 00:57:59.766
...you know, the lobby's decent.

876
00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:02.769
The key word is it's cheap.

877
00:58:04.105 --> 00:58:05.731
What time is it?

878
00:58:06.274 --> 00:58:07.900
Time for you to go.

879
00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:11.487
It's so hard to leave you.

880
00:58:15.783 --> 00:58:17.743
Beautiful woman.

881
00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.416
How'd you sleep?

882
00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:27.002
Good.

883
00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:32.799
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

884
00:58:32.926 --> 00:58:34.927
about that earthquake in China?

885
00:58:36.804 --> 00:58:38.514
Terrible.

886
00:58:40.642 --> 00:58:42.559
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

887
00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:45.562
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

888
00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:47.064
Yeah.

889
00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:02.829
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

890
00:59:02.914 --> 00:59:05.290
Papa's getting so into the idea.

891
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:07.543
It should be good for you.

892
00:59:09.462 --> 00:59:11.838
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

893
00:59:13.424 --> 00:59:16.176
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

894
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.220
...before you went to work.

895
00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:21.348
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

896
00:59:21.474 --> 00:59:24.935
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

897
00:59:26.813 --> 00:59:29.940
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

898
00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:32.609
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

899
00:59:45.498 --> 00:59:48.000
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

900
00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.501
Let me come up.

901
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:52.379
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

902
00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:54.881
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

903
00:59:58.136 --> 01:00:00.387
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

904
01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:04.975
Come on.

905
01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.399
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

906
01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:14.901
Hey, did you get that pest control...?

907
01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.153
Oh, yes. Yes.

908
01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:18.655
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

909
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.157
It's much better than cheese,

910
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.534
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

911
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.037
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

912
01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.622
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

913
01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:27.914
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

914
01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:28.915
Bye.

915
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.201
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

916
01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.411
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

917
01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:07.954
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

918
01:01:07.955 --> 01:01:10.332
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

919
01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.708
Yeah.

920
01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:14.336
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

921
01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:16.338
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

922
01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:17.798
Heths didn't have a problem

923
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.800
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

924
01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.843
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

925
01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.096
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

926
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.347
- No.
- Yeah.

927
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:28.100
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

928
01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:31.103
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

929
01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.814
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

930
01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:37.609
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

931
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.736
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

932
01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:42.197
But she's just such an odd girl.

933
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.117
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

934
01:01:45.993 --> 01:01:47.994
But something's just...

935
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:50.747
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

936
01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.374
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

937
01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:55.627
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

938
01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.462
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

939
01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:59.631
but, I don't know...

940
01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.009
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

941
01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:07.139
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

942
01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.266
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Chloe, let you know.

943
01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:10.642
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

944
01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:13.520
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

945
01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:16.398
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

946
01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:18.650
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

947
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.026
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

948
01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:21.111
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

949
01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.238
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

950
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.656
I know Tom's dying to get away.

951
01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:26.283
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

952
01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:27.367
Me?

953
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.537
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

954
01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:33.665
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

955
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.542
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

956
01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.794
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

957
01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:40.881
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

958
01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.383
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

959
01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.551
I'd have sworn it was you.

960
01:02:44.635 --> 01:02:46.803
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Chris hailing a cab.

961
01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.680
He's completely dependant on our driver.

962
01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:50.056
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

963
01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:53.894
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

964
01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:57.147
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

965
01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.692
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

966
01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:04.029
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

967
01:03:04.071 --> 01:03:05.447
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

968
01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:06.907
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

969
01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.074
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

970
01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.159
Nuts.

971
01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.828
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

972
01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.790
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

973
01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:17.083
Just the Sarazin people at two.

974
01:03:17.084 --> 01:03:18.210
- Can we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

975
01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.588
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

976
01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:27.302
Chris. Where are you off to?

977
01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.429
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

978
01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.723
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

979
01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:34.684
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

980
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.605
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

981
01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.483
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

982
01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.443
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

983
01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.946
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Chloe, it's just...

984
01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.489
I don't wanna talk about Chloe anymore!

985
01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:49.741
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

986
01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:51.701
- Chris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

987
01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:54.120
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

988
01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:56.623
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

989
01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:57.749
It's a hard field.

990
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:00.252
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

991
01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:03.213
Tom's mother was right.
It just gets to a point, you know?

992
01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:05.006
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

993
01:04:05.132 --> 01:04:08.093
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

994
01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:13.223
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Chloe.

995
01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:16.893
Maybe I will.

996
01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:21.398
Don't say that unless you mean it.

997
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.527
Chloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

998
01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.655
I mean, it's... mechanical.

999
01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:35.036
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

1000
01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.374
Really. I mean it.

1001
01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:44.880
- Merry bloody Christmas.
- Lovely.

1002
01:04:44.922 --> 01:04:46.673
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

1003
01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:48.925
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

1004
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.802
- Well, it is Christmas.
- It's such a pity.

1005
01:04:50.928 --> 01:04:52.053
- Come on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

1006
01:04:52.179 --> 01:04:54.639
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

1007
01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:56.308
Hi.

1008
01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.685
I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.

1009
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.314
I've been thinking about you.

1010
01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:08.069
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

1011
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:11.948
OK. See you then.

1012
01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.575
Bye-bye.

1013
01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:16.202
There you are, Chris.

1014
01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:19.581
Chloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

1015
01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:21.458
over the past few months.

1016
01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:24.461
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

1017
01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:26.338
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

1018
01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.214
Well, who could have predicted these...?

1019
01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:30.550
Look, I don't want
you and Chloe to worry.

1020
01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:33.470
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

1021
01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:35.096
Oh, no, you've made Chloe happy,

1022
01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.223
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

1023
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:42.372
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Chris?

1024
01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.790
Yes.

1025
01:06:43.874 --> 01:06:47.544
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

1026
01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:48.628
- Boat.
- Boat.

1027
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.921
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

1028
01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:51.297
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

1029
01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:52.632
- What?
- No.

1030
01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.259
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

1031
01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:57.178
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

1032
01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.263
Oh, that reminds me,

1033
01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:00.807
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

1034
01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:01.808
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

1035
01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.436
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

1036
01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.312
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Míkonos and Crete.

1037
01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:07.439
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1038
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.025
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

1039
01:07:10.067 --> 01:07:11.067
Oh, God.

1040
01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:12.569
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

1041
01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:15.655
You know, I bought Chris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

1042
01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.574
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

1043
01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:19.325
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

1044
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.328
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

1045
01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:25.415
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

1046
01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:26.458
Poor thing.

1047
01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:29.085
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

1048
01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.211
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

1049
01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.963
I miss you.

1050
01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.799
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

1051
01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:36.342
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

1052
01:07:36.343 --> 01:07:38.553
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

1053
01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:40.680
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

1054
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.348
When can you get here?

1055
01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.810
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

1056
01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.228
Look...

1057
01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.606
It's a three-day weekend.

1058
01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.483
Tuesday.

1059
01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:53.985
Chris, I need to see you.

1060
01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:57.864
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

1061
01:07:57.948 --> 01:08:00.366
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

1062
01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:03.369
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

1063
01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.996
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

1064
01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.499
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

1065
01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:08.583
Jack Garner?

1066
01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:10.627
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

1067
01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.003
The traffic'll be terrible.

1068
01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:14.506
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

1069
01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.590
I don't mean today.

1070
01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.342
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

1071
01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:18.718
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

1072
01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.595
- Why did they do that?
- 'Cause it howls all night long.

1073
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:22.222
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

1074
01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:24.057
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

1075
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.100
That's mean.

1076
01:08:25.726 --> 01:08:28.228
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

1077
01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:29.729
I've some lovely new horses.

1078
01:08:29.855 --> 01:08:31.439
Do you remember when
Chris came here first,

1079
01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:33.483
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

1080
01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:34.609
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

1081
01:08:34.735 --> 01:08:36.569
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

1082
01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.196
- No.
- Yeah.

1083
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:39.823
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

1084
01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:40.990
- Where from?
- Anyway...

1085
01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:43.493
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
- ... he's a wonderful new horse.

1086
01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:46.371
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

1087
01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:50.959
Excuse me.

1088
01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:54.254
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

1089
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.090
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

1090
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.134
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

1091
01:08:59.593 --> 01:09:00.593
Hello?

1092
01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.887
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

1093
01:09:03.347 --> 01:09:05.265
Are you mad calling me here?

1094
01:09:05.891 --> 01:09:07.517
When are you coming over?

1095
01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:09.602
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

1096
01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.771
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

1097
01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:14.649
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

1098
01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.866
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1099
01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.410
'Cause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

1100
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:28.538
- ...horse for Chris.
- They got it in the navy?

1101
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.292
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

1102
01:09:32.293 --> 01:09:34.878
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

1103
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.296
Well, they only had biscuits.

1104
01:09:36.297 --> 01:09:38.673
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Cordial originated...

1105
01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:42.552
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

1106
01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:45.763
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

1107
01:09:45.806 --> 01:09:48.057
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

1108
01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.435
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

1109
01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.645
It's no big deal.

1110
01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:53.897
I'll pop back into town.

1111
01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:57.942
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

1112
01:09:58.068 --> 01:09:59.694
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

1113
01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.446
Well, it is a pity because I...

1114
01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.698
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

1115
01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:05.158
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

1116
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.327
but, you know,
Chris has a lot of responsibility.

1117
01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:09.078
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

1118
01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.580
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

1119
01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:11.706
- Can you, can you...?
- Well, I think so.

1120
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:14.542
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1121
01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.419
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

1122
01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.046
but you couldn't wait.

1123
01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:21.841
What unbelievable bad luck.

1124
01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:24.719
Christ, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

1125
01:10:24.803 --> 01:10:26.596
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

1126
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.473
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

1127
01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.599
Is that your interpretation?

1128
01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:31.726
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

1129
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.354
not as part of some fertility project.

1130
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.356
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

1131
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.191
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

1132
01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.818
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

1133
01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:43.446
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

1134
01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.323
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

1135
01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.367
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

1136
01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:49.369
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

1137
01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:52.372
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

1138
01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.457
Why? You hate your job,
you hate your life.

1139
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.210
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

1140
01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.003
Look, Nola, I have to go.

1141
01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:01.005
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

1142
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.633
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

1143
01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.636
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

1144
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.887
Chris...

1145
01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:11.140
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

1146
01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:13.726
I'm not walking away from this.

1147
01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:18.356
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

1148
01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.778
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

1149
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.906
Us.

1150
01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.367
Is something wrong?

1151
01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:33.538
Yeah. There is.

1152
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040
What?

1153
01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.168
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

1154
01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:40.753
you know it's not a problem.

1155
01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.923
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Chloe.

1156
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:48.303
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

1157
01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:51.931
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

1158
01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:56.686
What is it?

1159
01:12:01.191 --> 01:12:04.569
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

1160
01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.948
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

1161
01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.705
Are you having an affair?

1162
01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.916
Am I having an affair?

1163
01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:21.085
Yeah, that's what I asked.

1164
01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:25.465
- No.
- You are.

1165
01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.717
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

1166
01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:40.980
Do you not love me anymore?

1167
01:12:43.233 --> 01:12:45.443
Of course I love you.

1168
01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.738
Well, what's wrong?

1169
01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:54.243
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

1170
01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:56.329
You're not. How?

1171
01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.959
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

1172
01:13:05.255 --> 01:13:07.256
I just...

1173
01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:10.343
...feel so guilty.

1174
01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:13.846
So terribly guilty.

1175
01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:16.265
Listen, Chris.

1176
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.769
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

1177
01:13:19.853 --> 01:13:24.273
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

1178
01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:30.279
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

1179
01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:35.993
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

1180
01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.665
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

1181
01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.795
Oh, Chloe.

1182
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.011
Let's get off the subject.

1183
01:13:54.054 --> 01:13:58.057
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

1184
01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:01.894
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

1185
01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:07.525
I had to talk to somebody.

1186
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.194
I'm really suffering.

1187
01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:13.322
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

1188
01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:17.577
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

1189
01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:20.955
But when the time came to tell her...

1190
01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:23.583
...I couldn't do it.

1191
01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:26.085
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

1192
01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.964
It's crazy.

1193
01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:33.968
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

1194
01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:36.429
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

1195
01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.807
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

1196
01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:42.477
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

1197
01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.228
Right.

1198
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.107
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

1199
01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:50.735
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Chloe?

1200
01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:56.616
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

1201
01:14:56.742 --> 01:15:00.119
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

1202
01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.371
Is it for a woman you love?

1203
01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:05.124
To live how? Where?

1204
01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:08.461
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

1205
01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.379
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

1206
01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:13.591
There must be another job in another
firm that you can just, you know...

1207
01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:16.719
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

1208
01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.888
And he loves me.

1209
01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:22.475
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

1210
01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:25.144
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

1211
01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:28.022
We're going away for three weeks.

1212
01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:31.108
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

1213
01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:34.612
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

1214
01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:37.990
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

1215
01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:40.243
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

1216
01:15:40.285 --> 01:15:43.287
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

1217
01:15:43.288 --> 01:15:46.374
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

1218
01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:47.792
which is all you ever tell me...

1219
01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.670
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

1220
01:15:52.005 --> 01:15:53.923
It's a big blow.

1221
01:15:54.007 --> 01:15:56.175
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

1222
01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.637
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

1223
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.806
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

1224
01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:04.433
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

1225
01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:06.644
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

1226
01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:10.940
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

1227
01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:13.025
Hey, keep your voice down.

1228
01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:16.195
You know I make love to her.

1229
01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:18.823
And you know it's just routine.

1230
01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.326
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

1231
01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:26.289
Yeah.

1232
01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.459
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

1233
01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.169
It will.

1234
01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:35.715
- It will.
- OK.

1235
01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:42.179
The holiday's off.

1236
01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:43.723
Why? What happened?

1237
01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.933
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

1238
01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.185
Why?

1239
01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:50.605
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

1240
01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:52.481
Anyway, he needs recovery time

1241
01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:55.818
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

1242
01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:57.361
Let me just pack up my stuff.

1243
01:16:57.362 --> 01:16:59.989
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

1244
01:17:00.073 --> 01:17:01.699
Yeah.

1245
01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:18.841
Hello?

1246
01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.773
Hello?

1247
01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.791
An opportunity has arisen, Chris,

1248
01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.918
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

1249
01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:54.919
Really?

1250
01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.046
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

1251
01:17:57.130 --> 01:18:00.257
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

1252
01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:04.762
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

1253
01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:07.056
assuming our predictions are correct.

1254
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.516
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

1255
01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:11.560
Eleanor. I've just
told Chris the good news.

1256
01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:14.563
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

1257
01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:16.691
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

1258
01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.776
You already are a young grandmother.

1259
01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.070
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

1260
01:18:21.154 --> 01:18:23.155
but I'd like you to be a mother.

1261
01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:25.449
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

1262
01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.703
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

1263
01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:30.454
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

1264
01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.540
Great. You forgot.

1265
01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:35.209
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

1266
01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:36.961
So my hints worked.

1267
01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:40.172
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

1268
01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.215
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

1269
01:18:41.341 --> 01:18:43.592
- Hello?
- Chris?

1270
01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:44.844
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

1271
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.470
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

1272
01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:48.097
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

1273
01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:49.807
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1274
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.183
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

1275
01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.477
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

1276
01:18:53.603 --> 01:18:56.105
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

1277
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:57.481
I've been waiting a week.

1278
01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.484
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

1279
01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.611
When are you coming home?

1280
01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.196
In about two weeks.

1281
01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.866
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

1282
01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.367
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

1283
01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:10.202
Chris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

1284
01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:12.204
OK. OK...

1285
01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:14.081
Who is that? What country are you in?

1286
01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.208
Your mobile's been impossible.

1287
01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.711
I told you. I'm in Greece.

1288
01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:21.255
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

1289
01:19:21.339 --> 01:19:23.883
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

1290
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.886
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

1291
01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.387
Can you just...?

1292
01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:31.015
Please tell Chloe
as soon as you get home.

1293
01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:33.893
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

1294
01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:36.228
Do you miss me?

1295
01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.272
OK. Bye, bye.

1296
01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.525
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1297
01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.360
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

1298
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.681
Chris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

1299
01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.683
Sardinia.

1300
01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:17.019
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

1301
01:20:27.697 --> 01:20:29.949
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

1302
01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:31.826
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

1303
01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.166
You lied to me.

1304
01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:40.793
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

1305
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.336
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Chloe!

1306
01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:44.213
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Chloe.

1307
01:20:44.297 --> 01:20:45.214
Look, Christ, Christ.

1308
01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.549
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

1309
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:47.842
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

1310
01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:49.093
I can explain. I... Taxi!

1311
01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.469
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

1312
01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:52.805
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Calm down.

1313
01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.683
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Calm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

1314
01:20:55.725 --> 01:20:57.226
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

1315
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.812
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Chloe.

1316
01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:02.481
- I wanna talk to Chloe!
- Calm down. Calm the fuck down!

1317
01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:06.443
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

1318
01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:08.362
You're a liar!

1319
01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:15.244
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

1320
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.121
I only came back
the day before yesterday

1321
01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:19.373
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Chloe

1322
01:21:19.499 --> 01:21:22.334
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

1323
01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:24.336
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

1324
01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:26.130
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

1325
01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:27.590
I was about to when you called.

1326
01:21:27.632 --> 01:21:28.716
What does that have to do with anything?

1327
01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:29.967
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

1328
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.510
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

1329
01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:33.637
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

1330
01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:36.390
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

1331
01:21:36.474 --> 01:21:38.893
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

1332
01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:40.519
Well, she has to know eventually.

1333
01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.855
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

1334
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:43.898
Nola, stop!

1335
01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:46.275
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

1336
01:21:46.359 --> 01:21:47.902
We don't have to have a child together.

1337
01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:49.737
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

1338
01:21:49.779 --> 01:21:51.864
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

1339
01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.159
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

1340
01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:57.912
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

1341
01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.914
Nola, be reasonable.

1342
01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.000
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

1343
01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:05.252
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

1344
01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:06.670
So, you're threatening me?

1345
01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:09.298
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

1346
01:22:09.674 --> 01:22:11.258
Were you lying to me?

1347
01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:12.801
All those times we made love,

1348
01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:15.888
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

1349
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.515
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Chloe.

1350
01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:22.394
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

1351
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:27.149
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

1352
01:24:22.265 --> 01:24:23.640
Have you seen Chris?

1353
01:24:23.683 --> 01:24:25.684
A minute ago. He went that way.

1354
01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:27.811
Chris?

1355
01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:29.772
Chris?

1356
01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.691
Chris?

1357
01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.326
Where are you, Chris?

1358
01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:45.579
Chris?

1359
01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.335
Chloe, are you there?

1360
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:52.920
Have you seen Chris anywhere?

1361
01:24:52.962 --> 01:24:55.297
No. Could you come up for a minute?

1362
01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.966
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

1363
01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:00.594
Yeah, OK.

1364
01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:28.080
I'm telling Chloe tomorrow.

1365
01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:30.874
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

1366
01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:33.961
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Chris.

1367
01:25:34.003 --> 01:25:36.004
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

1368
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.007
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

1369
01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:41.093
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1370
01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:43.887
My theory is you want me to tell Chloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

1371
01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:46.723
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

1372
01:25:46.766 --> 01:25:48.350
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

1373
01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:51.520
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

1374
01:25:51.604 --> 01:25:54.022
Look, Chris,
if I don't do something about this,

1375
01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.150
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

1376
01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:58.777
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

1377
01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:00.904
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

1378
01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:04.283
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

1379
01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.285
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

1380
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:10.622
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

1381
01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:12.166
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

1382
01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:15.794
Yeah. Chris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

1383
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.046
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

1384
01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:22.551
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

1385
01:26:22.635 --> 01:26:23.802
Did you hate it?

1386
01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:26.555
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

1387
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:28.515
I thought you were gonna pass out.

1388
01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:30.893
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

1389
01:26:33.813 --> 01:26:36.148
I still can't do it with you tonight.

1390
01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.650
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

1391
01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:45.908
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

1392
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:47.075
No. What are you doing?

1393
01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.827
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

1394
01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:50.829
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

1395
01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:54.791
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

1396
01:26:54.834 --> 01:26:56.585
'Cause I don't know
where else it can be.

1397
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:59.463
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

1398
01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:04.593
Is this it?

1399
01:27:04.677 --> 01:27:07.221
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

1400
01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:09.223
I've got to have words
with her about it.

1401
01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.933
It's really...

1402
01:27:10.975 --> 01:27:12.726
What did you just put in your pocket?

1403
01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:15.437
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

1404
01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.855
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

1405
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.607
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

1406
01:27:18.691 --> 01:27:20.234
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

1407
01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.945
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

1408
01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:24.196
- Guess what?
- What?

1409
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.698
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

1410
01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:28.742
You haven't. That's not like you.

1411
01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.994
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

1412
01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.956
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

1413
01:27:33.998 --> 01:27:35.707
No, that's not so.

1414
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:39.253
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

1415
01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:41.255
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

1416
01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:43.715
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

1417
01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:45.509
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

1418
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:49.137
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

1419
01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.224
You're so sweet.

1420
01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.768
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

1421
01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.607
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

1422
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:02.484
OK, I will.

1423
01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:08.115
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

1424
01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:11.660
When you get off work today,
come right home.

1425
01:28:11.744 --> 01:28:13.745
I have some good news.

1426
01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:18.166
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

1427
01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:20.127
You've got to meet me
right after work.

1428
01:28:20.169 --> 01:28:22.879
We have... plans to make.

1429
01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:27.175
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

1430
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.927
It's good. This is good.

1431
01:28:29.053 --> 01:28:31.805
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1432
01:28:31.931 --> 01:28:34.308
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

1433
01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:39.896
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

1434
01:28:39.939 --> 01:28:42.149
Is that right, Chris? A half year?

1435
01:28:42.191 --> 01:28:43.191
Yes.

1436
01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:45.902
A half year should do it, maybe less.

1437
01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:48.655
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

1438
01:28:55.038 --> 01:28:56.788
Good.

1439
01:28:58.082 --> 01:29:00.959
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

1440
01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:03.170
for developing their capacity.

1441
01:29:03.212 --> 01:29:05.714
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

1442
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.602
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

1443
01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:23.106
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

1444
01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.801
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Chris.

1445
01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:35.554
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

1446
01:30:35.638 --> 01:30:36.805
We met here last...

1447
01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:39.307
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

1448
01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:41.393
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

1449
01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:46.022
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

1450
01:30:46.065 --> 01:30:48.692
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

1451
01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:51.778
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

1452
01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:55.699
I'm Chris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

1453
01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:57.200
Well, what's the trouble?

1454
01:30:57.285 --> 01:31:00.078
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

1455
01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:04.082
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

1456
01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:07.711
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

1457
01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:08.795
Yes.

1458
01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:12.841
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

1459
01:31:12.925 --> 01:31:16.094
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

1460
01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:18.180
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

1461
01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:20.223
I have to take my medicine.

1462
01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:40.243
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

1463
01:32:03.267 --> 01:32:06.269
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

1464
01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:50.702
Mrs. Eastby?

1465
01:35:53.873 --> 01:35:55.832
It's lan.

1466
01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:04.883
Mrs. Eastby?

1467
01:36:09.638 --> 01:36:11.848
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

1468
01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:17.604
I'm going down the corner shop.
Can I get you anything?

1469
01:36:21.901 --> 01:36:24.611
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

1470
01:36:48.427 --> 01:36:49.427
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

1471
01:36:49.553 --> 01:36:52.180
D'you ever get that
portable CD player we talked about?

1472
01:36:52.264 --> 01:36:54.307
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

1473
01:36:54.433 --> 01:36:55.391
Excellent.

1474
01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:14.828
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

1475
01:37:45.442 --> 01:37:46.734
Nola.

1476
01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:58.580
Excuse me.

1477
01:38:08.007 --> 01:38:09.507
Hello.

1478
01:38:10.259 --> 01:38:11.593
Where are you?

1479
01:38:12.761 --> 01:38:15.346
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

1480
01:38:47.046 --> 01:38:48.504
- Good evening.
- Hello.

1481
01:38:53.552 --> 01:38:55.553
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

1482
01:38:55.679 --> 01:38:57.180
Two pounds.

1483
01:39:02.311 --> 01:39:04.312
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

1484
01:39:21.705 --> 01:39:23.331
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

1485
01:39:23.415 --> 01:39:25.458
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

1486
01:39:25.542 --> 01:39:27.543
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

1487
01:39:27.586 --> 01:39:28.920
As he, or they, were running out

1488
01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:31.464
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

1489
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:32.840
Either out of panic,

1490
01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:35.927
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

1491
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.596
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

1492
01:39:38.681 --> 01:39:40.807
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

1493
01:39:40.849 --> 01:39:43.226
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

1494
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:45.687
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

1495
01:39:45.729 --> 01:39:47.105
Probably cased her.

1496
01:39:47.106 --> 01:39:49.482
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

1497
01:39:49.608 --> 01:39:51.609
She picked the wrong time to come home.

1498
01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:54.320
Some people just don't have any luck.

1499
01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.324
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

1500
01:39:58.367 --> 01:40:00.243
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

1501
01:40:00.369 --> 01:40:01.995
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

1502
01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:03.246
Do you need anything from the car?

1503
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.373
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

1504
01:40:05.457 --> 01:40:08.710
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

1505
01:40:08.752 --> 01:40:10.628
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

1506
01:40:10.754 --> 01:40:12.463
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

1507
01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:13.881
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- she didn't answer.

1508
01:40:13.966 --> 01:40:16.718
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

1509
01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.511
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

1510
01:40:18.595 --> 01:40:21.222
- So someone was in there...?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

1511
01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:23.266
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

1512
01:40:23.267 --> 01:40:25.018
Could we send the
photographers in now, please?

1513
01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:26.269
No, hang on. If you just wait.

1514
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:28.646
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

1515
01:40:28.772 --> 01:40:32.025
Chris, Chris, can you
liaise with this man here?

1516
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:34.610
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

1517
01:40:34.653 --> 01:40:37.030
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

1518
01:40:37.156 --> 01:40:38.990
Scenes of Crime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

1519
01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:40.366
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

1520
01:40:40.409 --> 01:40:42.618
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

1521
01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:44.537
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

1522
01:40:44.663 --> 01:40:47.040
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

1523
01:40:47.166 --> 01:40:50.501
Nothing. It was a portable CD player
which reads MP3s, CD rewrites...

1524
01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.545
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

1525
01:40:52.671 --> 01:40:54.756
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

1526
01:40:54.798 --> 01:40:56.049
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

1527
01:40:56.175 --> 01:40:59.010
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

1528
01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:01.179
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

1529
01:41:01.263 --> 01:41:02.680
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

1530
01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:06.059
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

1531
01:41:06.185 --> 01:41:07.435
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

1532
01:41:07.519 --> 01:41:09.187
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

1533
01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:11.397
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

1534
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:14.442
They can make them pretty small.
Catherine, love, you can't park there.

1535
01:41:14.526 --> 01:41:16.694
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOCO coming down.

1536
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:20.782
Did you like the musical last night?

1537
01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:25.411
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

1538
01:41:25.454 --> 01:41:27.830
Yeah, he's very good.

1539
01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.666
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

1540
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:32.794
Good.

1541
01:41:35.547 --> 01:41:38.966
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

1542
01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:43.346
Oh, my God! Nola!

1543
01:41:43.347 --> 01:41:46.182
- Nola Rice.
- What?

1544
01:41:46.475 --> 01:41:50.186
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

1545
01:41:50.813 --> 01:41:53.815
What? Here, let me see that.

1546
01:41:53.857 --> 01:41:55.691
Jesus Christ!

1547
01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:01.697
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

1548
01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:05.743
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

1549
01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:08.329
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

1550
01:42:08.372 --> 01:42:12.375
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

1551
01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:14.752
Oh, my God.

1552
01:42:20.259 --> 01:42:21.843
Hello?

1553
01:42:22.761 --> 01:42:25.388
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

1554
01:42:25.514 --> 01:42:27.098
Isn't it just terrible?

1555
01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:30.393
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

1556
01:42:30.519 --> 01:42:33.521
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

1557
01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.773
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

1558
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.109
I know.

1559
01:42:38.152 --> 01:42:40.736
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

1560
01:42:40.779 --> 01:42:42.530
Hello?

1561
01:42:42.614 --> 01:42:45.116
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

1562
01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:48.035
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

1563
01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.495
I suppose she must've...

1564
01:42:49.538 --> 01:42:52.248
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

1565
01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:54.542
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

1566
01:42:54.626 --> 01:42:56.377
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

1567
01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.629
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

1568
01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:01.924
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

1569
01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:03.926
over the past year.

1570
01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:06.637
Did you hear that? Yeah.

1571
01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:11.058
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

1572
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:18.816
Mummy.

1573
01:43:20.944 --> 01:43:22.945
I've got something to tell you.

1574
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.072
But I want Chris to be here.

1575
01:43:26.325 --> 01:43:28.201
Chris?

1576
01:43:28.327 --> 01:43:31.287
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1577
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:33.331
He was just in here. Chris?

1578
01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:36.042
Chris?

1579
01:43:43.342 --> 01:43:44.717
He was just here.

1580
01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:46.469
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1581
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:48.971
Just wait. Wait, wait. Chris?

1582
01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:23.506
Where are you? Chris?

1583
01:44:25.008 --> 01:44:26.259
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1584
01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:28.010
Well, I just really want him to be here.

1585
01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:30.388
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

1586
01:44:30.973 --> 01:44:33.099
- Can we tell her now?
- Sure.

1587
01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:35.393
Well, I wanted you to be here.

1588
01:44:35.477 --> 01:44:37.019
Well, what is it?

1589
01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:38.521
Mummy...

1590
01:44:38.647 --> 01:44:41.399
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

1591
01:44:41.483 --> 01:44:43.150
It looks like I'm pregnant.

1592
01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:45.528
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

1593
01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:49.407
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

1594
01:44:50.033 --> 01:44:51.534
Alec?

1595
01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:54.287
Alec? Come here.

1596
01:44:54.538 --> 01:44:56.914
We're both walking on air.

1597
01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.167
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

1598
01:45:00.252 --> 01:45:02.128
- 'Cause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

1599
01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:03.421
Chloe's pregnant.

1600
01:45:03.547 --> 01:45:06.007
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

1601
01:45:06.049 --> 01:45:08.426
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

1602
01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:10.177
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

1603
01:45:10.262 --> 01:45:11.178
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1604
01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:12.805
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

1605
01:45:12.931 --> 01:45:15.266
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

1606
01:45:15.309 --> 01:45:19.145
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Congratulations! That's wonderful.

1607
01:45:19.187 --> 01:45:20.646
Thank you, Margaret.

1608
01:45:21.565 --> 01:45:23.065
Sam?

1609
01:45:23.066 --> 01:45:25.693
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

1610
01:45:25.777 --> 01:45:27.653
Detective Mike Banner, called.

1611
01:45:27.696 --> 01:45:30.823
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

1612
01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:34.410
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

1613
01:45:34.453 --> 01:45:36.412
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

1614
01:45:36.455 --> 01:45:37.830
I bet it was that night...

1615
01:45:37.956 --> 01:45:41.208
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

1616
01:45:43.712 --> 01:45:47.173
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

1617
01:45:47.215 --> 01:45:49.425
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

1618
01:45:49.468 --> 01:45:51.677
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

1619
01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.346
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

1620
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:55.973
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

1621
01:45:58.101 --> 01:46:01.228
- Granny would have been thrilled.
- ...alternative medicine.

1622
01:46:01.355 --> 01:46:04.482
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

1623
01:46:04.608 --> 01:46:07.443
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Congratulations!

1624
01:46:07.486 --> 01:46:09.236
Detective Banner, please.

1625
01:46:09.321 --> 01:46:11.322
This is Chris Wilton.

1626
01:46:14.993 --> 01:46:15.993
Oh, hello.

1627
01:46:16.078 --> 01:46:18.579
This is Chris Wilton. You called?

1628
01:46:18.622 --> 01:46:21.499
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

1629
01:46:21.625 --> 01:46:23.834
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

1630
01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:27.338
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

1631
01:46:27.381 --> 01:46:30.633
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

1632
01:46:33.512 --> 01:46:35.763
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

1633
01:46:35.847 --> 01:46:37.848
I certainly hope not.

1634
01:47:44.416 --> 01:47:46.959
- Chris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

1635
01:47:47.085 --> 01:47:50.045
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1636
01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:52.965
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

1637
01:47:53.049 --> 01:47:57.094
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

1638
01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:01.348
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

1639
01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:03.851
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

1640
01:48:04.436 --> 01:48:05.728
How?

1641
01:48:06.605 --> 01:48:09.857
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

1642
01:48:09.941 --> 01:48:11.692
That's...

1643
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.487
- ...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

1644
01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:19.575
They broke up. A year ago. More.

1645
01:48:20.994 --> 01:48:22.995
When did you last see her?

1646
01:48:23.955 --> 01:48:26.248
Oh, God, I can't remember.

1647
01:48:29.711 --> 01:48:32.880
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

1648
01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:35.466
But that was a long time ago.

1649
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.886
Have you seen her since?

1650
01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:41.138
Not that I recall.

1651
01:48:43.892 --> 01:48:45.518
Have...?

1652
01:48:46.728 --> 01:48:48.145
Have you ever seen this?

1653
01:48:49.147 --> 01:48:51.148
No. What is it?

1654
01:48:52.484 --> 01:48:55.027
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

1655
01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:06.247
No.

1656
01:49:07.249 --> 01:49:09.250
As you can see...

1657
01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:12.253
...you're all over it.

1658
01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:21.804
Yes, I can see that.

1659
01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:27.309
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

1660
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:29.895
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

1661
01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:36.443
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

1662
01:49:37.153 --> 01:49:39.446
But you people have to protect me here.

1663
01:49:40.407 --> 01:49:43.200
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

1664
01:49:43.285 --> 01:49:45.286
How long did your affair go on?

1665
01:49:50.458 --> 01:49:53.335
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

1666
01:49:54.170 --> 01:49:56.338
They broke up, she moved away.

1667
01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:01.176
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

1668
01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:05.598
God, have a heart.

1669
01:50:06.349 --> 01:50:08.726
My wife is gonna have a baby.

1670
01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:11.312
This will devastate her.

1671
01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.856
Did you...

1672
01:50:14.232 --> 01:50:18.110
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

1673
01:50:18.486 --> 01:50:20.613
No, I did not.

1674
01:50:20.989 --> 01:50:23.324
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

1675
01:50:24.242 --> 01:50:27.578
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

1676
01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:35.711
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

1677
01:50:35.754 --> 01:50:38.088
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

1678
01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:40.215
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

1679
01:50:41.885 --> 01:50:44.887
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

1680
01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:48.599
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

1681
01:50:49.643 --> 01:50:53.270
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

1682
01:50:53.396 --> 01:50:55.397
But you did lead her on,

1683
01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:58.275
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

1684
01:50:58.902 --> 01:51:01.278
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

1685
01:51:01.279 --> 01:51:04.031
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

1686
01:51:04.908 --> 01:51:10.412
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

1687
01:51:11.039 --> 01:51:13.916
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

1688
01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:16.043
much less Nola Rice.

1689
01:51:21.424 --> 01:51:24.301
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

1690
01:51:24.386 --> 01:51:26.428
and she walked in when it was happening?

1691
01:51:28.306 --> 01:51:31.809
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

1692
01:51:32.185 --> 01:51:34.186
...wreck people's lives.

1693
01:51:34.312 --> 01:51:37.398
My family, my marriage is at stake.

1694
01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:41.068
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

1695
01:51:41.152 --> 01:51:43.570
OK, but I'm not your man.

1696
01:51:44.072 --> 01:51:47.282
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

1697
01:51:47.325 --> 01:51:49.576
but that does not make me a murderer.

1698
01:51:49.786 --> 01:51:52.705
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

1699
01:51:52.789 --> 01:51:54.790
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

1700
01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:56.458
And if we have to talk to you again,

1701
01:51:56.459 --> 01:51:58.836
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

1702
01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.462
Your personal life's your own.

1703
01:52:00.463 --> 01:52:04.341
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

1704
01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:16.603
I understand.

1705
01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:19.231
Look...

1706
01:52:19.315 --> 01:52:21.483
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

1707
01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:23.569
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

1708
01:52:23.611 --> 01:52:25.612
please call me on my mobile.

1709
01:52:25.989 --> 01:52:28.115
This is my number.

1710
01:52:29.993 --> 01:52:31.577
Thanks.

1711
01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:33.245
One other thing.

1712
01:52:33.371 --> 01:52:35.748
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

1713
01:52:37.876 --> 01:52:39.376
Me?

1714
01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:40.753
No.

1715
01:52:40.879 --> 01:52:44.715
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

1716
01:52:44.758 --> 01:52:47.009
You can check it out, but...

1717
01:52:47.969 --> 01:52:51.889
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

1718
01:52:52.015 --> 01:52:54.099
Of course.

1719
01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.021
Thank you.

1720
01:53:07.655 --> 01:53:09.656
So, what do you think?

1721
01:53:10.241 --> 01:53:12.034
I think it's what it looks like.

1722
01:53:12.035 --> 01:53:14.161
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

1723
01:53:14.245 --> 01:53:17.790
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

1724
01:53:18.792 --> 01:53:22.377
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

1725
01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:24.421
He's 'specting a baby.

1726
01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:27.049
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

1727
01:53:28.176 --> 01:53:29.802
...we can find out discreetly enough

1728
01:53:29.928 --> 01:53:32.888
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

1729
01:53:34.766 --> 01:53:38.811
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

1730
01:53:38.937 --> 01:53:41.772
never mind sawing one off.

1731
01:53:42.565 --> 01:53:45.567
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

1732
01:53:45.568 --> 01:53:47.319
Not even a speeding ticket.

1733
01:53:47.445 --> 01:53:50.197
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

1734
01:53:50.281 --> 01:53:52.574
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

1735
01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.910
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

1736
01:53:54.953 --> 01:53:56.453
Well, come on, Mike.

1737
01:53:56.579 --> 01:53:58.413
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

1738
01:53:58.456 --> 01:54:00.582
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

1739
01:54:00.708 --> 01:54:02.960
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

1740
01:54:03.086 --> 01:54:06.088
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

1741
01:54:06.089 --> 01:54:10.717
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

1742
01:54:10.802 --> 01:54:13.846
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

1743
01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:15.806
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

1744
01:54:15.849 --> 01:54:19.226
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

1745
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:21.603
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

1746
01:54:21.604 --> 01:54:24.356
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

1747
01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.809
Chris.

1748
01:56:33.736 --> 01:56:35.487
Nola...

1749
01:56:37.615 --> 01:56:39.866
...it wasn't easy.

1750
01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:43.578
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

1751
01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:48.500
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

1752
01:56:50.128 --> 01:56:54.256
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

1753
01:56:55.466 --> 01:56:57.259
You have to.

1754
01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:59.845
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

1755
01:56:59.887 --> 01:57:02.097
And what about me?

1756
01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:04.891
What about the next-door neighbor?

1757
01:57:05.643 --> 01:57:08.645
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

1758
01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:14.985
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

1759
01:57:16.904 --> 01:57:21.283
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

1760
01:57:23.411 --> 01:57:25.662
You were collateral damage.

1761
01:57:25.747 --> 01:57:28.165
So was your own child.

1762
01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:34.421
Sophocles said:

1763
01:57:35.923 --> 01:57:38.133
"To never have been born

1764
01:57:38.676 --> 01:57:41.178
may be the greatest boon of all."

1765
01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:45.891
Prepare to pay the price, Chris.

1766
01:57:46.809 --> 01:57:48.935
Your actions were clumsy.

1767
01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.687
Full of holes.

1768
01:57:50.813 --> 01:57:53.940
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

1769
01:57:57.528 --> 01:58:00.447
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

1770
01:58:00.531 --> 01:58:02.449
and punished.

1771
01:58:03.576 --> 01:58:07.329
At least there would be
some small sign of justice.

1772
01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:10.332
Some small...

1773
01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:14.461
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

1774
01:58:16.839 --> 01:58:20.050
Chris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

1775
01:58:20.093 --> 01:58:21.843
What?

1776
01:58:23.096 --> 01:58:24.679
It's as we speculated

1777
01:58:24.722 --> 01:58:27.099
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

1778
01:58:27.225 --> 01:58:30.310
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

1779
01:58:30.353 --> 01:58:32.062
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

1780
01:58:32.105 --> 01:58:33.105
He waited in the hall.

1781
01:58:33.231 --> 01:58:35.107
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

1782
01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:38.443
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

1783
01:58:38.486 --> 01:58:40.612
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

1784
01:58:40.738 --> 01:58:42.989
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

1785
01:58:43.074 --> 01:58:45.575
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

1786
01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:47.119
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

1787
01:58:47.203 --> 01:58:49.371
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

1788
01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:51.206
and I am going to break this case.

1789
01:58:51.249 --> 01:58:53.125
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

1790
01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:54.209
What?

1791
01:58:54.252 --> 01:58:56.211
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

1792
01:58:56.254 --> 01:58:57.504
What's the bad news?

1793
01:58:57.588 --> 01:59:00.507
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

1794
01:59:00.591 --> 01:59:03.260
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

1795
01:59:03.386 --> 01:59:06.596
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

1796
01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.390
No, he didn't have to.

1797
01:59:08.391 --> 01:59:11.643
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

1798
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:15.522
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

1799
01:59:16.524 --> 01:59:19.776
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

1800
01:59:19.861 --> 01:59:22.154
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

1801
01:59:22.238 --> 01:59:24.489
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

1802
01:59:24.782 --> 01:59:27.159
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

1803
01:59:27.785 --> 01:59:29.786
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

1804
01:59:29.912 --> 01:59:31.746
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

1805
01:59:31.789 --> 01:59:34.124
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

1806
01:59:34.167 --> 01:59:35.625
No, wait.

1807
01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:39.671
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

1808
01:59:41.048 --> 01:59:44.426
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

1809
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:47.262
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

1810
01:59:47.305 --> 01:59:49.181
Come on.

1811
01:59:50.516 --> 01:59:51.766
I give up.

1812
01:59:51.809 --> 01:59:53.643
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

1813
01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:56.062
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

1814
01:59:56.147 --> 01:59:59.441
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

1815
02:00:00.151 --> 02:00:02.944
What a world. Am I right?

1816
02:00:03.404 --> 02:00:06.406
Careful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

1817
02:00:06.449 --> 02:00:09.451
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

1818
02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:11.453
Right. Champagne.

1819
02:00:11.537 --> 02:00:13.788
- I think he's got your eyes, Chloe.
- Really?

1820
02:00:13.831 --> 02:00:16.208
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

1821
02:00:16.292 --> 02:00:19.544
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

1822
02:00:20.838 --> 02:00:22.464
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

1823
02:00:22.465 --> 02:00:25.175
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Christopher.

1824
02:00:25.218 --> 02:00:28.720
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

1825
02:00:28.846 --> 02:00:31.181
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

1826
02:00:31.224 --> 02:00:32.724
Let's work on number two. Come on.

1827
02:00:32.850 --> 02:00:36.186
Come on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

1828
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:37.479
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

1829
02:00:37.563 --> 02:00:39.606
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

1830
02:00:39.690 --> 02:00:40.982
- Chloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

1831
02:00:41.108 --> 02:00:42.609
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

1832
02:00:42.693 --> 02:00:44.819
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

1833
02:00:44.862 --> 02:00:45.862
Please do.

1834
02:00:45.988 --> 02:00:46.988
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

1835
02:00:47.114 --> 02:00:49.324
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

1836
02:00:49.367 --> 02:00:51.826
With parents like Chloe and Chris,

1837
02:00:51.869 --> 02:00:54.621
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

1838
02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.248
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

1839
02:00:56.374 --> 02:00:58.250
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

1840
02:00:58.376 --> 02:00:59.709
I just hope that he's lucky.

1841
02:00:59.752 --> 02:01:01.378
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

1842
02:01:01.462 --> 02:01:02.754
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

1843
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.714
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

1844
02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:07.592
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

1845
02:01:07.635 --> 02:01:09.010
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

1846
02:01:09.136 --> 02:01:10.387
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

1847
02:01:10.513 --> 02:01:12.639
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

1848
02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:16.226
What are you saying about him?

1849
02:01:16.269 --> 02:01:18.270
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

1850
02:01:18.396 --> 02:01:22.357
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

1851
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.650
I wonder what he's thinking.

1852
02:01:23.734 --> 02:01:25.026
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

1853
02:01:25.027 --> 02:01:26.736
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

1854
02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:28.738
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

1855
02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:31.491
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.
