00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.332
Keep the change.

[male voice over PTA
system, unintelligible]

7
00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:43.372
Alright!

[screams]

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.447
I know, I know,
I know, a gun.

10
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.479
It's dangerous
for no one
except you.

11
00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:52.321
You know what
I want, don't you?

12
00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.190
Yes sir.

13
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:57.595
You're wasting time.
Don't fuck with me!

14
00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.996
Open it.
Open it!

15
00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:16.479
Open itl!

16
00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:25.721
Give me
what I want.

17
00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.954
I-I don't have
anything else.

18
00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.963
(Keith)
Man's offering you all
that money, /'d take it.

19
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.490
When I need financial
advice, I'll call
my broker.

20
00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:36.093
I'm just
sayin' is all.

21
00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.228
Whatever. Take
off your coat.

22
00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.431
Take off your coat!!

23
00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:52.647
Oh. Now how
hard was that?

24
00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.744
Excuse me.

25
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.017
Mister, I thought
I told you--

26
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.255
What the--!!

Face down on

Come on guys,
get down.

48
00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:04.376
Down. Drop down.
Down, get down.

49
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.284
Get down.
Search the tracks.

50
00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:11.416
He went down the tunnel?
Check the tunnel,
check the roof.

51
00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:20.062
Come on, people,
come down on the
ground now.

52
00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.259
He jumped.

53
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.961
He was on top
of the roof.

54
00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:26.495
This train
is closed.
Nobody gets on.

55
00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:28.769
Sir, I need you
to calm down.

56
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.708
Get these
people moving.

57
00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:42.321
(Voutjritsas)
Stop right there.

58
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.892
Punk's got balls.

59
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.554
But no
positive identification?

60
00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.530
No, there's another
camera pointing at
the platform.

61
00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:01.163
Michaels, stop
it right there.

62
00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:03.641
You see
what I see?

63
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.041
Maybe.

64
00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:06.806
That's him, Lieutenant.

65
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.006
That's who?

66
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:09.446
How long
you been
a detective?

67
00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:10.745
Uh, 11
months, sir.

68
00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:12.979
I'm 22 years
in robbery
and homicide.

69
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:16.580
One of your
sub-categories of
robbery is art theft.

70
00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.920
There's a lof of
that in the Apple.
Are you aware of that?

71
00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:20.050
I guess
so, yeah.

72
00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.651
I wasn't. When
I was your age,

73
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.322
I was quite happy
with regular murder
and mayhem.

74
00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.196
Lieutenant Weber
minored in art
history at Fordham.

75
00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.328
Anyway, the Chief
starts callin' me
Lieutenant Picasso,

76
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.872
and puts me in
charge every time
there is the theft

77
00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.306
of as much as
an Etch a Sketch.

78
00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:38.572
Two decades, /'ve
been putting ‘em
all away.

79
00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:40.636
Everybody but him.

80
00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:43.375
Keith Ripley. He's
the best there is.

81
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.145
Howdy, Keith.

82
00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.537
You've been bad boy.

83
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.752
Perhaps I could
give you 15.

84
00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:22.789
No. That is
not possible.

85
00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:24.551
I wouldn't take
less than 100.

86
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.922
Oh, man.

87
00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:29.325
I'm just
saying is all.

88
00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:30.590
You.

89
00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:31.789
Mind if I
borrow this?

90
00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:35.961
Well, I may have
wanted to use it.

91
00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:39.130
But yours will do.

92
00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.639
Will you please
put down my gun?

93
00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:43.574
There's one thing
you should be
aware of, Gabriel.

94
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.135
Or do you prefer
Sefior Martin?

95
00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.909
The police cannot
arrest you for
armed robbery

96
00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.279
if your gun
isn't loaded.

97
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.011
Your point?

98
00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:54.315
Think I'd
walk around with
a loaded shotgun?

99
00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:57.448
Let's see.
[click]

100
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.184
You could've checked.

101
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.696
Why? You have my
diamonds, my score,
my money.

102
00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:07.256
Enjoy. Nice
meeting you
both. Bye.

103
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:11.065
By the way--I1 was
going to ask
for 125.

104
00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:14.971
I'm just
saying, is all.

105
00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.475
Gabriel, stay.

106
00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.341
Why? What
else do
you want?

107
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:21.278
You gonna
shoot me now?

108
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.748
Well in as much
as you did steal
the diamonds,

109
00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:27.047
I figure it's only
fair to share the
proceeds with you.

110
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.284
So to what do
I owe this act
of generosity?

111
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:34.383
I have a proposition
I wish to discuss
with you.

112
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:42.324
So, how did you
know I would
come here?

113
00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:43.460
As well as
my name?

114
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.095
It's part of
the proposition.

115
00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:47.663
[screeching tires]

116
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.401
Aw, shit.

117

[groan]

118
00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:53.676
(Keith)
Come on.
Take jt easy.

119
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.008
Nicky would
like his money.

120
00:11:58.685 --> 00:11:59.675
Ask him.

121
00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.948
Thank you.

122
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:05.753
This is something between
you and them, got nothing
to do with mel!

123
00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.953
Everything does now.

124
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.257
Call this interest.

125
00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.232
Nicky's tired of
waiting for you.

126
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.699
[speaks Russian]

127
00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.497
[groan]

128
00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:26.746
You must have
very bad karma.

129
00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:28.907
I actually don't
believe in it.

130
00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.416
Look. About
this propo--

131
00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:31.951
No, no, no!

132
00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:35.215
You are totally out
of your mind!
Good night.

133
00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:40.088
[groan]

134
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.888
Hey! Here's
your karma.

135
00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.660
What was in the
other envelope?

136
00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:50.203
Your cut.

137
00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:54.605
Now you've
got mine.

138
00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:57.541
Whatever.

139
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.578
Think about it.

140
00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.239
Yeah, sure, yeah.

141
00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.499
Hmm.

142
00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:34.771
Now, what do
you want?

143
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.350
A partner.

144
00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:41.649
What do you think
I was doing on
that train?

145
00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:45.214
I was watching
your work.

146
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.784
I've been your shadow
ever since you
got to town.

147
00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:52.661
So why were
you in my town,
robbing subways?

148
00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:57.135
It's hurricane season
in Miami. I don't
like hurricanes.

149
00:13:57.203 --> 00:14:00.104
Or you didn't
feel like going
back to Angola.

150
00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:04.038
It's over.
Lesson learned.

151
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.102
Look. Gabriel
Martin is a
rock star.

152
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.413
So, why were you holding
open mike night on
the subway

153
00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:13.111
for a lousy
hundred grand?

154
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:18.419
Two reasons. Yes.
Miami was getting
too hot

155
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:20.858
and perhaps you
can relate to this:

156
00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:22.725
sometimes--

157
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:27.059
sometimes you
just need to
feel the rush.

158
00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.870
The juice.

159
00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:34.964
Yeah. You know
what I mean.

160
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:38.238
Yesterday, you took
down two jewelers

161
00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:41.542
for a few stones
from Romanov's.

162
00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:44.311
My idea is
Romanov's itself.

163
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.876
[snorts]
Please.

164
00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:51.390
Specifically two
Faberge eggs worth
20 million dollars.

165
00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.323
Each.

166
00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.592
It's a
two-man job.

167
00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.764
Do I have
your attention?

168
00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.251
Wait here.

169
00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.624
I hear they
prefer cash.

170
00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.459
Or your firstborn.

171
00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:57.948
Why don't you try
The Standard instead?

172
00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.856
Jealous?

173
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.193
Of who?

174
00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:08.791
The mystery bandit.

175
00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:12.361
I'm afraid that
type of thing
is not my style.

176
00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:15.965
Well, I think
this guy's got
panache. Guts.

177
00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:23.044
And a
passing resemblance,
at least in body type.

178
00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:26.312
Well, you don't have
to rob trains to
have panache.

179
00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.854
Or guts.
But you got
to admit,

180
00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.913
that kind of
thing immediately
brands you.

181
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:35.689
[speaks Russian]

182
00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:39.356
My treat. Too painful
watching you attempt
to read Cyrillic.

183
00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:40.797
Qh, no,
I was
just, uh--

184
00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.699
looking at
the picture.

185
00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:43.997
So you
are jealous.

186
00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:48.998
Yes. You got
me there.
Absolutely.

187
00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:56.511
I got to get this
Chinese food to
my boss, so, um--

188
00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:59.244
some other time.

189
00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:01.047
When some
other time?

190
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.485
I'll call you.

191
00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:05.320
But you don't
have my number
or know my name.

192
00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.790
I guess
that could
be a problem.

193
00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.951
(Keith)
Gabriel!

194
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:10.988
Oh, shit.

195
00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.462
Are you with him?

196
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:16.093
I don't know.
Should 1? More
or less. Yes. I am.

197
00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.466
What do
you want?

198
00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.132
Can't I bring
my goddaughter a
birthday present?

199
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.232
My birthday
was last month.

200
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:26.279
It was two weeks
ago. I'm sorry
it's late.

201
00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:28.973
Alex, it's
just a present.
No strings.

202
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.951
No thanks.

203
00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:36.819
Well, it was nice to
have almost met
you, Gabriel.

204
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:37.879
Gaby.

205
00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:42.720
It's a shame you don't
keep a higher class
of company.

206
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.702
Don't even
think about it.

207
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.534
Think about what?

208
00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:53.936
Going anywhere
near her.

209
00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.701
I'll rip
your heart
out, I mean it.

210
00:17:55.775 --> 00:18:00.076
It looks like it's your
heart she's not
so fond of.

211
00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:02.581
You were warned.
Let's go.

212
00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:05.242
(Gaby)
I thought you said
the target was Romanov's.

213
00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:07.252
This is research.

214
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.310
Research?

215
00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.116
Oh, wow.

216
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:17.159
They're absolutely stunning.

217
00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:22.064
They are.

218
00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:25.001
Between 1885
and 1916,

219
00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:28.336
Faberge produced 50
of these Easter eggs
for the Empress.

220
00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:31.377
And her daughter-in-law,
the Czarina Alexandra.

221
00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.379
Should I take notes?
Will there be a quiz?

222
00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:38.213
No quiz. But
there will be
a test.

223
00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:43.882
Okay. The Faberges
are all made of precious
metals and fine jewels.

224
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:46.687
Every one a
unique masterpiece.

225
00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:47.885
Indeed.

226
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.054
Most are on display
in the Kremlin.

227
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.929
And the rest in
private collections,
museums, or lost.

228
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.469
In this case,
at Romanov's.

229
00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.526
Who is
your buyer?

230
00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:01.767
You don't
want to know.

231
00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:04.811
I'm stealing 40 million
dollars worth of eggs,
so I want to know.

232
00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:07.244
I also want to
know why these
particular eggs

233
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:10.214
are even worth
40 million dollars.

234
00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.910
‘Cause no one
knows they exist.

235
00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:17.354
Oh. The so-called
mystery eggs.

236
00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:18.481
Mm-hmm.

237
00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:19.820
Yeah, I've
heard rumors

238
00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:22.327
but I thought
it was just
a myth.

239
00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:25.387
Last year,
they turned up.

240
00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.159
At Romanov's.

241
00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.997
So how do
you know this?

242
00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:33.733
I was partners with
a man named Victor
Korolenko. Alex's father.

243
00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:35.638
He was in tight
with the Russians.

244
00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.473
What they knew,
he knew.

245
00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:41.275
So, why aren't you
pulling this job
with him?

246
00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:45.011
Let's just
say he's no
longer around.

247
00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:46.552
Leave it at that.

248
00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:53.752
He's gone.
You're here.

249
00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:57.087
Now we just
have to deliver.

250
00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:03.360
Ripley.
Why?

251
00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:07.529
Why risk your
freedom at all?

252
00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.665
This will not
be anything
close to easy.

253
00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:11.710
You are not in
jail in the present.

254
00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:13.541
Are you not,
uh, comfortable?

255
00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.205
I'm never comfortable.

256
00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:20.412
Some people
were born to
compose music.

257
00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:25.117
Others to
split the atom.

258
00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:27.660
I was born
to steal shit.

259
00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:31.724
Hold out
your hand.

260
00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:34.390
The hand?

261
00:20:39.472 --> 00:20:43.705
That coin was given
fo me by Victor when
we became partners.

262
00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:46.074
The coin represents
a Russian phrase.

263
00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:48.341
[speaks Russian]

264
00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:52.248
Loosely translated,
"thieves' world."

265
00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:53.979
Victor belongs
to it.

266
00:20:54.053 --> 00:20:56.647
Now--

267
00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:58.588
you belong
to it.

268
00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:39.291
Psst.
Hey.

269
00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:43.996
You misunderstand.
Ripley's just,
uh, business.

270
00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:45.036
This is, uh--

271
00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:46.538
Stalking?

272
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.734
Well, if
you had given
me your number,

273
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.869
I'd have
called first.

274
00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:55.880
Those are
two very
flawed assumptions.

275
00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:57.677
Do you have a vase?

276
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.684
I just took
these from
a roadside shrine

277
00:21:59.752 --> 00:22:02.414
and I think
they need
some, uh, water.

278
00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:07.119
Uh, may I use
that, uh, thing
over there?

279
00:22:07.193 --> 00:22:09.389
Yeah, yeah,
of course.

280
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:13.489
You know, I
noticed this, uh,
Russian nightclub

281
00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:17.298
down the block, uh,
Riga Rose, something
like that?

282
00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.463
Why don't we
meet there,
after work?

283
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.509
I'm busy.

284
00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:28.946
I'll wait.

285
00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.778
I won't show.

286
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.318
I'll take
my chances.

287
00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:39.317
[speaks Russian], Alexandra.

288
00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:42.361
(Michaels)
Research, Keith Ripley.

289
00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:44.487
'93, the Brooklyn Museum.

290
00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:46.554
'94, the Diamond
District Warehouse,

291
00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:47.929
and then in '95--

292
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.197
I'm very familiar
with Ripley's
life story.

293
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.262
In fact, I
busted him twice.

294
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.139
Both times he
walked because
of good lawyering.

295
00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.940
Exactly. So I thought
why not swing for
the fences?

296
00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:01.878
Murder one.
Victor Korolenko.

297
00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:04.575
You're thinkin' of the
Brighton Beach
steam bath?

298
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.776
There was
no body.

299
00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:07.444
But we got
a ton a forensics.

300
00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:08.782
And no witnesses.

301
00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:10.948
Nobody there
admitted to
seeing a thing.

302
00:23:11.023 --> 00:23:14.687
I was this close to
convincing Korolenko
to take witness protection

303
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.819
in exchange for
giving up Ripley.

304
00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:19.456
But Ripley got
to him first.

305
00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.124
I can't prove it.

306
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.328
Alright, okay,
I see, I see.

307
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:26.599
No. What you
don't see, Michaels,

308
00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:29.471
is why Ripley
got involved in
a smalltime caper

309
00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:33.000
like grabbing a few
diamonds off of some
couriers on a subway.

310
00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:37.276
And neither did 1.
Until I read the Dutch
guy's statement.

311
00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:41.809
Those diamonds
came from Romanov's.

312
00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:46.688
You mean Ripley and his
new partner are planning
to take down Romanov's?

313
00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.387
Ah, come on.
Like that could
ever happen.

314
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:54.058
Not even Ripley
could take down
a place like that.

315
00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:55.464
Wanna bet?

316
00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:58.868
[dancing music]

317
00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:23.689
Hi.

318
00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.890
Hi. You know
this place
very well.

319
00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:28.935
I never said I
didn't. And
let's face it,

320
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:31.971
you didn't see the
nightclub. You saw
the flyer in the fax,

321
00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:34.199
and then
you made
an assumption.

322
00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:37.436
Yep. Guilty.
So, I did.

323
00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:42.345
Never assume anything,
especially down here.

324
00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:43.813
How mysterious.

325
00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:45.111
What?

326
00:24:45.184 --> 00:24:48.245
How mysterious.
Can I buy you
a drink?

327
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.788
I don't drink.

328
00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.482
Another assumption.

329
00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:55.387
Wanna dance?

330
00:24:58.697 --> 00:24:59.926
Yeah.

331
00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:02.661
I'm willing to
make a fool
of myself.

332
00:25:02.735 --> 00:25:04.203
Why not?

333
00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:04.524
(Alex)
Amina! Here!
[speaks Russian]

334
00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:05.620
And for him.

335
00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:06.687
Thank you.

336
00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:07.926
Thanks.

337
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.059
I thought all
Russians drank.

338
00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:13.264
Translation, we're
a race of
suicidal alcoholics.

339
00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:15.306
No. I didn't
mean that. No.

340
00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:17.900
Actually, we
are. Cheers.

341
00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.603
Nastaravia.

342
00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:21.112
Nastarovia.

343
00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.306
Nastarovia?

344
00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:23.871
Hmm.

345
00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:28.750
So, how is it,
working for
the lawyer?

346
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:31.882
Hmm. I'm a
lawyer too,
you know.

347
00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:36.326
Ooh. Maybe I won't say another
word because everything
I assume is wrong.

348
00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:38.090
Well, you don't
know until you try.

349
00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:39.722
True.

350
00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:42.790
Besides, my father
warned me about
being a lawyer.

351
00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:45.929
He told me I should
try and do something
honest with my life.

352
00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:48.473
As if he
would know.

353
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.740
Your father and, uh,
Ripley, they were
close, right?

354
00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.577
Once upon
a time.

355
00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:04.219
I'm sure Ripley
told you my
father's dead.

356
00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:08.226
Now Ripley likes
to try to take
care of me.

357
00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:10.990
Pay for stuff.
That kind
of thing.

358
00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:14.124
Of course it's
the least he
can do.

359
00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:18.033
Sorry. I don't
mean to pry. And--

360
00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:25.438
Yes you do.

361
00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:31.906
Now who's
making assumptions?

362
00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:35.750
No, Gaby. I'm
not assuming
a thing.

363
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.799
You wanna know
about Ripley?

364
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.067
Stay away.

365
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.339
[raps gently
on door]

366
00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.476
You son of
a bitch.

367
00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:45.454
Well, you
dropped these
and I am a gentleman

368
00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:47.618
bringing them
back to you.

369
00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:49.627
Uh-huh.

370
00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:56.294
No, no, no.

371
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.034
No.

372
00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:02.631
[thunder and rain]

373
00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:49.946
[loud groan]

374
00:29:50.022 --> 00:29:53.253
[shout]
Man! What
do you want?

375
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:57.292
I told you to
leave her alone.

376
00:29:57.362 --> 00:30:00.388
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

377
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:02.797
Get dressed.
1'll be downstairs.

378
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.900
Son of a bitch.

379
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:18.878
Fascinating.

380
00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:24.582
You could start a
whole new trend in
interior design.

381
00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:28.518
What are these?

382
00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:29.788
What do they
look like?

383
00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:31.488
Police IDs?

384
00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:36.626
There's a reception at
Romanov's tonight,
honoring the NYPD.

385
00:30:36.702 --> 00:30:39.797
Our invitations
Just arrived.

386
00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:41.168
Cop for the night.

387
00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:43.867
All the donuts
you can eat.

388
00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:47.207
Meanwhile however, I
need you to go to
the dry cleaners.

389
00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:50.738
Why don't you go and pick
up your dry cleaning
yourself, sir?

390
00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:54.184
Who said anything
about picking up?

391
00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.742
You're dropping off.

392
00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:06.955
(male voice)
[speaks Vietnamese]

393
00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:37.059
Cell phone please.

394
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.552
(foreign language)

395
00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:07.149
We have
networking to do.

396
00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:08.750
Commissioner Rawls.

397
00:32:08.827 --> 00:32:10.454
Gentlemen.

398
00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:13.863
Deputy Commissioner
Morelli. Such a
pleasure having you here.

399
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:16.526
May we give you
gentlemen the
grand tour?

400
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.091
Oh, the secrets
of Romanov?

401
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.729
You might say so.

402
00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:21.204
Thank you.
We're honored.

403
00:32:21.273 --> 00:32:22.763
Please.

404
00:32:26.478 --> 00:32:29.038
(Keith)
The guards, all
FSB Secret Police.

405
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:32.448
Every door, every
inch of glass wired
and alarmed.

406
00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:37.114
So even if a bird
flies in here, they
know about it.

407
00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:38.884
Topkapi.

408
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.482
RIfifi.

409
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:43.654
No. The bird flew
into the museum,

410
00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:47.028
landed on the wire, and
set off the alarm
in Topkapi.

411
00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.532
You're a cineaste.

412
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.934
Well, actually,
I only see
heist movies.

413
00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:57.066
The lesson to take away
from the bird flying
into the museum is

414
00:32:57.142 --> 00:33:01.340
no matter how well you've
planned, always be ready
to improvise

415
00:33:01.413 --> 00:33:04.405
because I guarantee you,
something's gonna
go wrong.

416
00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:06.076
I prefer
to avoid that.

417
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:07.482
Mm-hm.

418
00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:10.317
How comprehensive is
the surveillance system?

419
00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:12.083
Let's take
a look.

420
00:33:15.594 --> 00:33:18.120
[Russian dialog]

421
00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.371
[male voices
speak Russian]

422
00:33:32.978 --> 00:33:34.275
Smart card
for the elevator.

423
00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:36.007
And all
the doors.

424
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:38.106
This way.
After you.

425
00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:39.309
We're on.

426
00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:44.913
(Morelli)
Good to see you, old friend.
Let me introduce you.

427
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.389
Lieutenant Zykov.

428
00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:49.655
Lieutenant Weber,
I presume.

429
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:54.256
You know, Ripley,
identity theft is
a serious crime.

430
00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:56.096
An embarrassing
one in this case.

431
00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.328
Really?

432
00:33:57.402 --> 00:33:59.996
Do you realize
how ashamed
I felt,

433
00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.800
telling that
nice young
lady at the door

434
00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.466
that I was
still a lieutenant?

435
00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:06.477
I mean at my age--
or should I say
your age?

436
00:34:06.545 --> 00:34:09.742
I'm not amused.
What are you
doin' here?

437
00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:13.273
And why did you appropriate
my invitation, as if
I didn't know?

438
00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:16.252
I apologize for
the subterfuge.

439
00:34:16.321 --> 00:34:19.586
I just wanted to show
my friend here some of
the finer things in life.

440
00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:21.126
Of course if you
want to arrest us

441
00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:23.627
for impersonating
police officers,
go right ahead.

442
00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:26.096
I'm sure my lawyer
will have us out
in two hours.

443
00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:29.327
It'd be a delightful
two hours. Get your
hands down.

444
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:33.065
Then there's all that
explaining you'd have
to do to your superiors.

445
00:34:33.138 --> 00:34:35.232
Now that would
be an embarrassment.

446
00:34:35.307 --> 00:34:39.471
Notorious thief gaining
admittance pretending
fo be you?

447
00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.376
Great police
work, Weber.

448
00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:44.211
We should discuss
my police work when
this is all over.

449
00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:47.081
Who's your sidekick?

450
00:34:47.152 --> 00:34:49.314
Jules Dassin.

451
00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:53.881
Good to meet you,
Jules. I love
your movies.

452
00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:58.089
Enjoy the
party, gents.
While it lasts.

453
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:04.828
Now--do you mind
telling me what
that was all about?

454
00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:06.632
Just a cop.

455
00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:08.366
Really?
No kidding.

456
00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:13.736
We have been made in
the very place we are
supposed to take down.

457
00:35:13.812 --> 00:35:16.474
Exactly how do
you stay out
of jail?

458
00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:22.043
Unless of course you and
this Weber are partners,
trying to set me up.

459
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.748
Are you, Ripley?

460
00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:25.813
[elevator ding]

461
00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.688
Okay, thank you.

462
00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:28.817
So here we go.

463
00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.554
Come on. Move
your damn ass!

464
00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.558
Weber has no idea
what we're
here for.

465
00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:39.035
Of course he does!

466
00:35:39.104 --> 00:35:41.402
He doesn't know when,
and he doesn't
know how.

467
00:35:41.473 --> 00:35:43.271
No, he doesn't
know about the eggs.

468
00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:45.139
No one
does. Here.

469
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.735
Best way to
neutralize Weber

470
00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:49.041
is to fuel his
obsession with
busting me.

471
00:35:49.114 --> 00:35:53.642
He is so blinded by it,
he no longer thinks
like a cop. Trust me.

472
00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:56.153
Give me a good
reason to. Huh?

473
00:35:56.221 --> 00:36:00.454
I already gave you
40 million good
reasons. Here.

474
00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.084
Now that you've seen
what the public sees,

475
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.060
it's time for
the real treat.

476
00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:05.392
As Jong
as you promise

477
00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.625
not to come back
and rob us.

478
00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:09.793
I guess /
won't take
any notes then.

479
00:36:09.868 --> 00:36:12.599
[chuckles]

480
00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:15.265
Our main vault.
[snaps fingers]

481
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.274
Gregor, disarm
the motion detectors.

482
00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:20.004
Even with the
knowledge of
all protocols,

483
00:36:20.078 --> 00:36:22.103
it is
absolutely impregnable.

484
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.844
The voice sensors ask
our head of security,
Boris Sergeev,

485
00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:28.443
a random set of
prerecorded words.

486
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.080
But this is only
half the process.

487
00:36:31.156 --> 00:36:35.286
We also have a
biometric hand
print sensor.

488
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.796
Since Mr. Sergeev and /
are the only ones who
have clearance,

489
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:41.230
we must both
be present to
open the vaults.

490
00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:44.325
Once / activate the
biometric hand
print sensor,

491
00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:46.769
he must activate
the voice sensor.

492
00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:49.569
This way neither of
us can escape from
the other.

493
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:52.440
You better
hope Mr. Sergeev
stays healthy.

494
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.501
[laughter]

495
00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:56.604
I must stay
healthy as well.

496
00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:57.739
[all chuckle]

497
00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:05.821
(female voice)
Hamburger.

498
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.689
Hamburger.

499
00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:11.356
Big Apple.

500
00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.420
Big apple.

501
00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:21.765
Jesus Christ.

502
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.333
The vault
door automatically
resets on the hour,

503
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.869
at which point,
the sensors must be
activated in reverse.

504
00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:33.111
Gentlemen, best not
fo get Jocked inside.

505
00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.016
Did I say it was
gonna be easy?

506
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:38.386
No, but you didn't
say it would be
impossible, either.

507
00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:41.422
Armored glass.
It would take

508
00:37:41.493 --> 00:37:45.157
a half an hour to break
through just one case.

509
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.825
But I'm afraid whoever
tried wouldn't even
have half a second

510
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.130
because an ultrasonic
motion detector

511
00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:54.365
would automatically
lock him in and trigger
the alarm.

512
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:56.305
Containment security,
gentlemen.

513
00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:58.138
Getting in is
highly improbable.

514
00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.610
But getting out js
frankly impossible.

515
00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:02.442
(Rawls)
Where does
that door lead?

516
00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:06.712
To our inner vault, which
contains our most
precious jtems.

517
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:08.275
Sorry, but
security prevents me

518
00:38:08.353 --> 00:38:10.549
from taking even
this distinguished
group in.

519
00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:12.852
Now, we'll proceed
back to the reception.

520
00:38:12.924 --> 00:38:14.414
I'd like
to once again,

521
00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:17.052
thank you both for your
generosity these
last few days

522
00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.823
in helping set
up all this.

523
00:38:18.897 --> 00:38:20.797
(Morelli)
Thank you for the
donation of the chopper.

524
00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.094
You're very welcome.

525
00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:25.797
Let's go. We can
do this, Gabriel.

526
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.965
No. Absolutely not.

527
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.532
It was a pleasure.
Goodbye.

528
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:32.633
Wait a minute.

529
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.805
Nobody's going
anywhere yet.

530
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.872
Zykov finds that
camera, he's gonna
know what it is.

531
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.941
He'll change all
the protocols.

532
00:38:41.019 --> 00:38:46.116
Which part of I don't
give a shit did you
not understand?

533
00:38:46.191 --> 00:38:49.650
[chatter]

534
00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:03.664
[gasps and groans]

535
00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.334
I'm sorry.

536
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.003
Let me, let me
just handle it.

537
00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:08.068
No, no, no.

538
00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:09.944
Please.
Allow me.

539
00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:12.372
I apologize, Sir.

540
00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:27.264
[beep]

541
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.353
What the fuck?

542
00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:55.549
What the fuck?

543
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.051
(Hal)
Detective Weber,
I'm Hal Donley,

544
00:39:58.129 --> 00:39:59.893
Special Agent
in charge of
this op.

545
00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:01.796
You're conducting
an investigation

546
00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:05.666
of a potential theft
that you assume is going
down at Romanov Jewelers.

547
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:08.297
Assume my ass.
I know it's
going down.

548
00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:10.000
And I know who's
pullin' it off.

549
00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.702
Except, we're askin'
you to call off
your dogs.

550
00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.144
There are other matters
that take precedence.

551
00:40:15.213 --> 00:40:18.342
What could possibly
fake precedence over
the potential theft

552
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:20.214
of millions
of dollars
in diamonds

553
00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:23.653
from a company that
donates tons of money
and equipment to the NYPD?

554
00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.348
Valentin?

555
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.917
Vitaly Zykov in
the old Soviet days

556
00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:34.158
was the right hand
man to a party boss
named Dimitri Kuzin.

557
00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:38.396
Kuzin set up a supposedly
independent Russian diamond
center in America.

558
00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:40.904
Romanov's.

559
00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:46.342
The diamonds, they're
not all that he's
shipping over here.

560
00:40:46.411 --> 00:40:49.005
He's ripping off
the Russian Treasury.

561
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.515
Gold, gems, artworks.

562
00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.710
Where do you
think Romanov's
got the money

563
00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:55.753
to buy
your department
a helicopter?

564
00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.584
And now
police cars?

565
00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:59.316
From retail
diamond sales?

566
00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.949
So why are
they doing this?

567
00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:02.515
Is that a
serious question?

568
00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.730
So the NYPD
will leave
them alone.

569
00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:09.199
That's their mindset.

570
00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:14.839
We need more time
to build our
mutual cases.

571
00:41:14.906 --> 00:41:20.868
That's why we can't have
any other investigations
potentially alerting Zykov.

572
00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:25.074
Lieutenant--

573
00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:28.075
shut it down!

574
00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:32.315
Gentlemen.

575
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.949
(Donley)
Commissioner.

576
00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:38.527
Just in case
you think you're
smarter than us,

577
00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:41.622
decide to continue
this investigation
on a down and low,

578
00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:46.899
forget it. This is bigger
than you and your ego.
You get it?

579
00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:49.262
I get it.

580
00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:55.545
(Voutjritsas)
So what did the
Feds have to say?

581
00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:58.241
Nothing. Everything's
still a go.

582
00:41:58.316 --> 00:42:02.275
(Keith)
First, to bypass
the security cameras.

583
00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:05.653
(Gaby)
If we can gain access
into the surveillance system,

584
00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:09.216
we can replace
the light feed
with a continuous loop

585
00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:12.422
of static
shots with no
face inside.

586
00:42:12.497 --> 00:42:14.591
That still leaves
the voice sensors,

587
00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.793
the fingerprints,
the motion detectors,

588
00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:20.862
and the meanest looking
vault door I have ever
seen in my life.

589
00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.693
(Ripley)
The Inner Vault Door.

590
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.855
Swiss made.
Three feet thick.

591
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.592
With spring driven
re-locking bolts.

592
00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:51.499
If you punch
out the lock,
they block retraction,

593
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:54.698
so that you couldn't open
it even if you knew
the combination.

594
00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.672
(Sergeev)
Abraham Lincoln.

595
00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:58.607
(female recorded voice)
Broadway.

596
00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.144
Broadway.

597
00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:02.942
Thirty prerecorded
words. One week, we
got them all.

598
00:43:03.014 --> 00:43:04.709
Dan McWilliams, MTA.

599
00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:07.547
We're gonna be doing
maintenance work
in the subway

600
00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:09.484
adjacent to your
basement next week.

601
00:43:09.554 --> 00:43:11.044
We'll be
working nights

602
00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:13.716
and didn't want the
drilling and what all
to alarm you.

603
00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:30.538
[ting-ting]

604
00:43:34.145 --> 00:43:36.944
(Gaby)
You place an ultrasonic
transducer here,

605
00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:40.951
broadcasting at the exact
operating frequency of
the transmitter,

606
00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:43.646
and it bounces back
the frequency to
the unit.

607
00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.883
At least in theory.

608
00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:48.619
Have you
ever used an
ultrasonic transducer?

609
00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:49.888
Nope.

610
00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:52.521
Can you get an
ultrasonic transducer?

611
00:43:52.597 --> 00:43:54.122
I can
get anything,
my friend

612
00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:55.791
Can you get
past the keypad?

613
00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:58.199
It js as always,
a question of time.

614
00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:00.397
One tumbler
at a time.

615
00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:03.998
It is tight--
but possible.

616
00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:10.046
[Russian dialog]

617
00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:22.784
You.

618
00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:26.697
Yeah. Me.

619
00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.640
What's so funny?

620
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:41.168
I hate Chinese food.

621
00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:45.239
I absolutely
unequivocally,

622
00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:49.378
irrevocably, loathe
Chinese food.

623
00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:55.816
Leonid, my boss,
is addicted to
Chinese food.

624
00:44:57.195 --> 00:44:59.630
I can't even
stand the smell.

625
00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:02.462
Another completely
wrong assumption.

626
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:08.097
No. It's not
completely wrong.

627
00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.135
What?

628
00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:24.349
Wow.

629
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:32.492
You stole this.

630
00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:33.553
Yes I did.

631
00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:34.621
Didn't you?

632
00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:36.929
Yes. That's
what I do.

633
00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:09.025
[heavy breathing, moans]

634
00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:22.741
Wait.

635
00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:50.998
[light dozing]

636
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.270
We have a problem.

637
00:46:57.348 --> 00:47:03.685
Hm. The bracelet?
I cannot return it.

638
00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:05.688
[chuckles]

639
00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:09.420
No. I like it.

640
00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:12.326
So. What could
possibly be
a problem?

641
00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:15.263
[sigh]
You.

642
00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:16.391
What?

643
00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:18.060
Me.

644
00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.797
Mm, and I thought
that part was not
a problem.

645
00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:22.270
And Ripley.

646
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.604
That part is
a problem.

647
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:29.044
Yours and Ripley's
is a world I just
can't trust.

648
00:47:32.817 --> 00:47:36.776
How did your
father die?

649
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:38.447
By gunshot.

650
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.217
Who did it?

651
00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:43.192
He had
gambling debts

652
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.697
to a Russian gangster
named Nicky Petrovich.

653
00:47:47.765 --> 00:47:48.926
Nicky wants
his money.

654
00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.626
Ask him.

655
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.762
This concept of,
um, rorovosky.

656
00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:56.739
Vorovosky mir, yes.
I'm familiar with it.

657
00:47:56.807 --> 00:48:00.368
Where one is responsible
for the debts of
another one.

658
00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:05.006
Why would they Kill
your father and
let Ripley live?

659
00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:08.985
Because Ripley has, I
don't know, how do you
want me to put this,

660
00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:10.043
earning power.

661
00:48:13.591 --> 00:48:18.495
[whispers]
Gaby. I don't wanna
go to any more funerals.

662
00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.626
I wanna be with you.

663
00:48:25.703 --> 00:48:27.694
But I can't
promise you that.

664
00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:31.572
And you can't
promise me a
thing, so,

665
00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:35.237
maybe we shouldn't
even try.

666
00:48:43.154 --> 00:48:46.419
Oh, you, you, you.

667
00:48:49.894 --> 00:48:51.055
Get in.

668
00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:04.899
I know you don't want to,
I know you don't mean to.
But you will hurt her.

669
00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:08.434
She doesn't need
any more of that.

670
00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:12.574
None of which you
had anything to do
with. Am I right?

671
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:17.918
Is there something
you wanna ask me?

672
00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.786
Yes.

673
00:49:19.857 --> 00:49:23.794
Why is Victor dead
and you're still
walking around?

674
00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:28.658
I'm sure Alex told you
that Victor was in deep

675
00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:30.894
to a man named
Nicky Petrovich.

676
00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:33.596
What she didn't know
was Nicky was ready to
forgive the debt

677
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:36.504
if Victor
pulled a job.
This job.

678
00:49:36.574 --> 00:49:37.632
Victor backed out.

679
00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:38.937
He was trying
to protect Alex.

680
00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:40.704
He made a deal
with Weber,

681
00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:43.110
he was gonna
drop the dime
on Nicky.

682
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.579
And you?

683
00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:48.084
And me. Weber
offered Victor
witness protection.

684
00:49:48.152 --> 00:49:50.246
Me and Alex.
But Alex didn't
want to go.

685
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:53.552
Victor didn't
want to go
without her, so,

686
00:49:53.624 --> 00:49:55.490
he bought
a bullet instead.

687
00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.653
So then why
is this still
your problem?

688
00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.662
Why don't you
Just Jeave?

689
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.258
You don't make a deal
with Nicky Petrovich
and then walk away.

690
00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:08.272
There's no statute of
limitations. Nicky
wants those eggs.

691
00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:12.207
Victor's share
would have paid
off his debt.

692
00:50:12.276 --> 00:50:15.507
Victor and I were
partners. He was
responsible for me.

693
00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:19.174
So now I'm
responsible for
him. And his debt.

694
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:22.345
Bullshit.

695
00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:24.615
Victor is dead.
Just walk away.

696
00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:25.678
It's not
an option.

697
00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:27.588
Oh, wow,
this is just--

698
00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.988
Look.

699
00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:33.723
We do the job.

700
00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:36.698
Nicky gets his cut.
I take a small chunk,

701
00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:39.862
nowhere near
commensurate with my risk,

702
00:50:39.937 --> 00:50:41.632
and you clear
a cool 20 million.

703
00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:44.572
I--1 don't know.
This--this is--

704
00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:48.044
Look, either we pull
this job off flawlessly,

705
00:50:48.112 --> 00:50:51.241
or you call Weber
and you ask for
witness protection.

706
00:50:51.315 --> 00:50:52.976
Which isn't a
choice at all.

707
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.451
Because Nicky will
find you and he
will kill you.

708
00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:59.012
Doesn't matter where
you go, or how
long it takes.

709
00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:01.456
That's an
unalterable fact.

710
00:51:10.134 --> 00:51:11.124
Well, uh--

711
00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:19.565
then we steal the
fucking eggs, no?

712
00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:21.870
Yes.

713
00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:27.208
Oh, shit.

714
00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:29.844
(Gaby)
We're working
on it.

715
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.081
(Andrej)
[speaks Russian]

716
00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:33.647
Back off, please.
Thank you.

717
00:51:33.724 --> 00:51:35.920
I think he
called us
a name.

718
00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:40.320
We do not like
to be insulted.

719
00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:44.700
Alright.
(Unintelligible).

720
00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:40.552
[distant whisper]

721
00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:06.481
Do you know
the significance
of this coin?

722
00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.814
Yeah.

723
00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:13.753
Then you must know,
by the mere fact

724
00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:15.622
that you have it
in your possession,

725
00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:18.685
I cannot assume
the two of you

726
00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:20.753
will not attempt
to double-cross me.

727
00:53:20.831 --> 00:53:22.458
Nobody's gonna try
to double-cross you.

728
00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:24.331
I've been
trying to--

729
00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.238
Nicky.

730
00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.542
Alex, I'm
SO sorry.

731
00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:35.101
We're all sorry,
aren't we?

732
00:53:35.179 --> 00:53:38.080
There's no reason
for you to bring
her here.

733
00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:41.516
The fact that
you gave that
coin to him

734
00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:44.316
tells me
there are
many reasons.

735
00:53:44.388 --> 00:53:46.618
But only one
I care about.

736
00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.715
Why would
we try to
betray you?

737
00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:52.251
Ripley, in your
case perhaps

738
00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.696
a misguided
sense of revenge.

739
00:53:54.765 --> 00:53:57.826
His, perhaps
simply greed.

740
00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:00.632
It doesn't matter.

741
00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:03.071
I will not take the
chance of the two
of you

742
00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.541
taking what js
rightfully mine.

743
00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:08.943
And selling
it to the
highest bidder.

744
00:54:09.012 --> 00:54:13.006
Um, please, uh,
excuse me, Mr.,
uh, Petrovich,

745
00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:15.245
will you please?
Thank you.

746
00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:19.881
Where is it written
that these eggs
are yours?

747
00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:26.319
Because they
belong to
my family.

748
00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:30.890
Because my great
grandfather made them.

749
00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:36.603
Yes, Ripley.
Evgenly Petrovich
made them.

750
00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:44.609
He made the 1917
Mystery Eggs.

751
00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:50.552
I will have those eggs.
And you will get
them for me.

752
00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:56.215
That's why I bring
Alexandra here,

753
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.593
to keep me company
while you do what
you need to do.

754
00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.022
Go.

755
00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:12.199
Anyone tries to
follow us, she dies.

756
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.501
You'd better
believe she dies.

757
00:55:15.579 --> 00:55:17.479
[sniffs]

758
00:55:17.548 --> 00:55:21.883
If I don't
get what /
want, she dies.

759
00:55:24.288 --> 00:55:25.653
Go.

760
00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:27.121
There's a
subway not far.

761
00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:28.215
[thud]

762
00:55:32.362 --> 00:55:34.387
Damn you, Gabriel.

763
00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:36.660
I told you
not to get
her involved.

764
00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:38.792
You told me?
You told me?

765
00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:42.305
You and her father
got her involved even
before she was born.

766
00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:44.636
Goddamn it!
We go tomorrow!

767
00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.883
[very loud pounding]

768
00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:01.352

[Russian dialog]

773
00:57:59.009 --> 00:58:01.103
(Gaby)
How much time?

774
00:58:01.178 --> 00:58:04.773
Just over three minutes
until the twenty-two
hundred hour check.

775
00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.956
[whirring]

776

Come on, come on!

783

Let's go.

784
01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:49.676

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.621
Seventeen.

788
01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:14.984
Seventeen.

789
01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:16.355
Norway.

790
01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:20.192
Norway.

791
01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.425
Tyi golodny?

792
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:26.399
Tyi golodny?

793
01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.369
Fuck.

794
01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:30.406
It wants to know
if I'm hungry.

795
01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.736
Are you?

796
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.769
Tyi golodny?

797
01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.146
Tyi golodny?

Alright.

Wait, wait, wait,

802
01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:43.635
Go.

803
01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.981
Stop.
Go right.

804
01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.157
Right.

805
01:04:58.528 --> 01:04:59.893
Right.

806
01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:02.261
Stop.

807
01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.232
Good.
Straight ahead.

Diagonally to

Keep going.
Left.

813
01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.725
Get your arm in.

814
01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:34.195
No arms/

815
01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.254
Flat down!

Okay. Let's

Shit. Alright, sit

835
01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:48.324
Yes. I owe you.

836
01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:51.663
Havin' a sale
at Romanov.

837
01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:56.399
That was my plant.
Unexplained alarm went
off about an hour ago.

838
01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:58.497
I want all available
units in the
garage now.

839
01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.567
Vouti and Michaels,
have them meet us
at the staging area.

840
01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.373
Now it's my turn.

841
01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.853
We're good.

842
01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.087

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.665
Damn it.

877
01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:08.796
Four five six
one two six.

878
01:10:09.906 --> 01:10:12.534
Bingo. Okay. Okay.

879
01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:22.574
Four five six one
two six. One.

880
01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:29.154
One.

881
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:33.492
Come on.
Come on.

882
01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:34.792
What the fuck
are you doing?

883
01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:37.892
Improvising.

884
01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:55.146
Shit. Take
this shit off.

885
01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:56.743
Grab it.

886
01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:59.083
(Weber)
Come on, move
around this guy.

887
01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:02.489
Move those guys outta
the way. Come on.
Move them away.

(Ripley)
Damn.

891
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.349
Hmm.

892
01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.685
Let's see if
we can move
these boxes.

893
01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:12.651
Alright.

894
01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:40.580
Okay.

895
01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:02.167
[gun cocks]

896
01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.248
What are you doing?

897
01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.180
Give me the box.

898
01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:09.908
Don't do this.

899
01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:10.976
Give me
the box.

900
01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:14.087
You want
more money?

901
01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.090
Look around you.
Take what
you want.

902
01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.320
Shut up
and give
me the box.

903
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:22.262
What about Alex?
Nicky will kill her,
you know that.

904
01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:25.130
I will ask you
one more time.

905
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.329
Why are you
doing this?

906
01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:30.634
[sigh]
I'm a cop.

907
01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:32.903
For...

908
01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:34.807
In Miami for the
last ten years.

909
01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.574
Weber requested me.
Just for you.

910
01:13:41.384 --> 01:13:43.512
So you're a cop.

911
01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:46.715
Want to arrest me?
Go ahead. Where
am I gonna go?

912
01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:49.486
But in one minute,
that vault door's
gonna lock

913
01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:50.684
and we'll be
stuck in here.

914
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.728
And Alex is
gonna be dead.

915
01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:55.730
I can't believe you're
such a contemptible
human being

916
01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:58.267
that you would
use her like that,
and then just kill her.

917
01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:00.826
‘Cause you might as
well be pullin' the
trigger yourself.

918
01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:05.033
Simply to bag the
great Keith Ripley.

919
01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:08.600
You sorry, sick
motherfucker.

920
01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.741
You got 30 seconds.

921
01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.580
How do I
find Nicky?

922
01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:17.141
Phone number
in my pocket.

923
01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:19.551
Give it to me.
And the eggs.

924
01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:23.392
Do you want
her alive?
Or not?

925
01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:24.449
Do you?

926
01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:37.700
[sigh]

927
01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:40.868
Ten seconds.

928
01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:42.138
I'm sorry.

929
01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.072
Underground, boys.

930
01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:15.304
(officer No. 3)
Alright. Come on.

931
01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.912

933
01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:05.958
I'm a
police officer.
Listen to me.

934
01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:08.326
There is a thief
locked in your
inner vault.

935
01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.695
The guard is in
the basement closet.

936
01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:14.327
Move. Move,
move, move,
move, (unintelligible).

937
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.532
Now. Move. Come on.

938
01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:19.802
Tell them to put
their weapons
down, now.

939
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:22.873
Now!

940
01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:23.673
[shout]

941
01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.544
Okay. Fine.

942
01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.478
Put them down.
Now!

943
01:16:31.554 --> 01:16:33.989
[speaks Russian]

944
01:16:36.559 --> 01:16:38.459
Kick them. Now.

945
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:42.755
What do
you want?

946
01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:46.928
You let me out
the front door, so
I can rejoin my unit.

947
01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:49.027
They have the
building surrounded.

948
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.302
Meantime, go downstairs
you'll find your thief
and your comrade.

949
01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:53.637
You understand?

950
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.108
That door
is alarmed.

951
01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:57.043
You have a
problem, solve it.

952
01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:59.445
Do not make
me shoot this
man, please.

953
01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.186

[shout]

955
01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:39.950
Put down
your weapons.

956
01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.148
We are police.

957
01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:43.317
Yeah? Everybody's
police tonight.

958
01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:51.690
(Nicky)
Hello?

959
01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.236
Hey. I have
what you want.

960
01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:55.429
No, it's just me.

961
01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:18.354
Can we talk?

962
01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:21.192
I have a
proposition for you.

963
01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:33.498
(Gaby)
Where is she?

964
01:18:38.581 --> 01:18:40.572
(Giorgi)
Do not move.

965
01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.981
He has a gun
behind the box.

966
01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:44.542
Bad boy.

967
01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.385
Give me the box. And
give Andrei your
weapon please.

968
01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.890
We don't
wish trouble here.

969
01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:50.585
No. You
don't understand.

970
01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:54.425
You let her go,
then I'll give
you the box.

971
01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:57.227
You see? If I
fire through
this box,

972
01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:59.996
which I have /
have no problem
doing whatsoever,

973
01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.696
Nicky's not going
to be very happy.

974
01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:04.068
Then, we are
all expendable.

975
01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:06.904
If you actually
understand the
meaning of that word.

976
01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.637
Open the box.

977
01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.141
Lower the gun.

978
01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:12.203
Lower the gun.

979
01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:13.908
Lower it.

980
01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.445
Okay.

981
01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:29.829
You alright?

982
01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.832
Yeah. I'm just
lovely, thanks.

983
01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.164
You go.

984
01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.408
Give me
the box.

985
01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.007
Get in.

986
01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.175
Why?

987
01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:50.616
Nicky wanted
fo see you.

988
01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.278
Give me your weapon.

989
01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:57.387
We're fine, right?

990
01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.563
Where do
you get off
detaining us?

991
01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.470
My apologies,
Lieutenant Weber.

992
01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.373
My security were
understandably confused.

993
01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:16.741
Please go with
Mr. Sergeev down
to the vault.

994
01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:17.938
We have what
you want.

995
01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:19.242
(Sergeev)
Please.

996
01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:30.753
Where's the
other one?

997
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.295
Nobody else.
Just him.

998
01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:35.091
Where the
hell is
my man?

999
01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.963
[clicks tongue]
Lieutenant,

1000
01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:41.560
your personal life,
none of my business.

1001
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:46.068
I apologize for
bringing you here.

1002
01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:49.668
But I had to be sure
the eggs were genuine

1003
01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:51.372
before /
let you go.

1004
01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:55.884
Your lack of trust
is really depressing,
Mr. Petrovich.

1005
01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.681
I'm a man
of my word.

1006
01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:07.123
She should
be with her
godfather now.

1007
01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.631
I see.

1008
01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.756
Do you mind?

1009
01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:11.857
Sure, call.

1010
01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:20.941
[cell phone rings]
Yeah.

1011
01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:27.173
Hello?

1012
01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.774
Hey. Where
are you?

1013
01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:32.845
I'm at the jail.
I had to see him.

1014
01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.116
How is he?

1015
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:35.850
Well, how do
you think he is?

1016
01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.621
I had no
choice, Alex.

1017
01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:40.321
No one had
a choice.

1018
01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:45.232
Remember? I told you,
neither one of us
could promise a thing.

1019
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.827
Listen. Promises
blow away in
the wind.

1020
01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.736
But feelings
are real.

1021
01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:54.868
And I need to know,
were the feelings
lies too?

1022
01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:57.412
Listen, listen,
what I mean is

1023
01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:00.005
are we real?

1024
01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:09.689
I gotta go, Gabriel.
Goodnight.

1025
01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.817
Wait, don't go.
Hold--/

1026
01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.469
Are you satisfied?

1027
01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.433
[shorts]

1028
01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.878
Did you see them?

1029
01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.718
Actually, we
were in a hurry.

1030
01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.048
Look.

1031
01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:51.063
They are
simply--wood?

1032
01:23:09.952 --> 01:23:11.943
Oh my God.

1033
01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.317
Simply wood?

1034
01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:21.158
It was 1917,
Gabriel. Russia.

1035
01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:22.823
People are starving.

1036
01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:26.630
There are no jewels,
no diamonds left.

1037
01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:28.397
No hope.

1038
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:32.839
Yet Czarina Alexandra
had to have her eggs.

1039
01:23:34.977 --> 01:23:39.107
Perhaps you understand
why we had a revolution?

1040
01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:42.845
People needed to
believe in something.

1041
01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:46.516
Take him home.

1042
01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:54.319
Gabriel.

1043
01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.601
I know what
they say about me.

1044
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:02.899
But I'm not
a killer.

1045
01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:06.532
Merely a
humble immigrant.

1046
01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:08.337
Probably much
like you.

1047
01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.013
I don't think so,
Mr. Petrovich.

1048
01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:15.547
You're not
like me, at all.

1049
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:31.826
(Sudimack)
Excellent. Thanks.
We got Petrovich.

1050
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.493
Snitch called it in.

1051
01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:35.059
You know
where he was?

1052
01:24:35.137 --> 01:24:36.901
I'm sure
you'll tell us.

1053
01:24:36.972 --> 01:24:39.407
He was sittin' on the
Boardwalk watchin'
the sun come up.

1054
01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:42.739
He's comin' in now.
I'll be right back.

1055
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.709
Yeah.

1056
01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:48.045
What I
didn't count on

1057
01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:49.914
was that a
so-called professional

1058
01:24:49.985 --> 01:24:52.010
would be manipulated
by a chick.

1059
01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.146
What kinda cops do
they make down there
in Miami?

1060
01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:56.247
Good ones,
Weber, good ones.

1061
01:24:56.325 --> 01:24:57.656
I don't
get it.

1062
01:24:57.726 --> 01:24:59.922
All these years
in their world.

1063
01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:01.554
How do you let
an asset use you?

1064
01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:05.634
Sometimes things,
uh, change.

1065
01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:07.726
Things change?
Like, uh,

1066
01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:10.067
which side am
I on change?

1067
01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.664
Ripley, what is
he, your best
friend now?

1068
01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:14.675
Hmm, actually
a better friend
than you.

1069
01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:18.543
Ah, I get it.
I'm the asshole.

1070
01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:20.673
You're gonna tell
me what a good
guy he is,

1071
01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:23.650
or how he got caught
up in a situation he
couldn't control,

1072
01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:25.653
or how the sins
of the father--

1073
01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:28.281
give me
somethin' better
than things change!

1074
01:25:28.357 --> 01:25:31.884
All I can give
you is truth.

1075
01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.421
Ah, fuck it.

1076
01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:37.363
Go back to
Miami, Martin.

1077
01:25:40.035 --> 01:25:43.938
When your superiors
get my report, you'll be
lucky if you have a job.

1078
01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:45.474
We'll see.

1079
01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.770
Hey. Say
anything you
want about Ripley

1080
01:25:47.843 --> 01:25:50.471
but nothing changes
the fact that I
finally got him.

1081
01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:54.539
And when he leaves prison,
he'll be leavin' in
a pine box.

1082
01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:58.486
Let's go see
Mr. Petrovich.

1083
01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:12.757
No.

1084
01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.201
That's not
Nicky Petrovich.

1085
01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:23.074
What?

1086
01:26:23.145 --> 01:26:24.738
Not him.

1087
01:26:27.816 --> 01:26:31.650
Look, man, organized
crime confirmed it.
That's Nicky Petrovich.

1088
01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.451
Well, I don't care.
That's not him.

1089
01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.787
I was there,
remember?

1090
01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:39.020
There's no
case here.

1091
01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:41.825
Of course
there's a case!

1092
01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:43.524
Think I'm gonna put
him on the stand?

1093
01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:46.033
An undercover Miami
cop who may or may
not be legit?

1094
01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:47.091
No offense.

1095
01:26:47.169 --> 01:26:48.295
None taken.

1096
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:50.304
A cop who's
the centerpiece

1097
01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:53.637
of a botched undercover
operation that was
officially stopped?

1098
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:56.838
I'm not going fo
embarrass the Bureau,
much less your department

1099
01:26:56.912 --> 01:26:59.711
which accepted tons of
money and equipment from
the Russian Mafia.

1100
01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:01.442
What about Romanov's?

1101
01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:03.712
What about the
stolen treasures
of Russia?

1102
01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.082
What about
it, Weber?

1103
01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:06.643
When Zykov
found Ripley
in the vault

1104
01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.952
he had everything
cleared out before
you could get in.

1105
01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:11.618
(Ripley)
I have a
proposition for you.

1106
01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:15.027
There's no way Romanov's
will press charges
against Ripley.

1107
01:27:15.097 --> 01:27:17.156
‘Cause they can never
admit that the eggs

1108
01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:19.667
or anything else,
ever existed.

1109
01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.999
(Sudimac)
So we can't even
prove that Martin

1110
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.334
and Ripley
stole even
a goddamn dime.

1111
01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:26.397
You must
have mug shots!

1112
01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:28.842
Russian Mafia, known
associates, something!

1113
01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:55.400
That's him.

1114
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.734
That's Nicky Petrovich.

1115
01:27:57.806 --> 01:28:00.400
Detective Martin,

1116
01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:03.206
that's Victor Korolenko.

1117
01:28:14.089 --> 01:28:19.027
Presumed dead. We
Just never found
the body.

1118
01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:24.858
And you
never will.

1119
01:28:26.268 --> 01:28:27.531
Lieutenant.

1120
01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:48.389
[groan]

1121
01:29:13.248 --> 01:29:15.080
Weber.

1122
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:16.481
What?

1123
01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:18.315
(Weber)
Lawyer got him
in front of a judge

1124
01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:20.047
on an expedited
bail hearing.

1125
01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:21.555
And then
he just walks.

1126
01:29:21.623 --> 01:29:22.715
(Gabriel)
Who was it?

1127
01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:23.781
Who was what?

1128
01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:25.293
The lawyer.

1129
01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.624
Who the fuck
do you think?

1130
01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.324
Alex Korolenko.

1131
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:56.789
(Alex)
You can't promise
me a thing, so--

1132
01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.986
maybe we
shouldn't even try.

1133
01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:22.874
Huh.

1134
01:30:39.668 --> 01:30:40.658
Papa.

1135
01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:43.067
(Russian dialog)

1136
01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:57.110
[cell phone rings]

1137
01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.846
Yeah?

1138
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.890
(Ripley)
Didn't wanna leave
without saying goodbye.

1139
01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:04.187
I owe you
one, Gaby.

1140
01:31:04.259 --> 01:31:05.749
The real
Nicky Petrovich

1141
01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:08.125
is the one Zykov
is funneling the
contraband through.

1142
01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:13.635
Well, thank you, but, uh,
Zykov and Petrovich have
gone to ground.

1143
01:31:13.702 --> 01:31:15.363
Check out a
disco called--

1144
01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:16.996
Riga Rose?

1145
01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:19.268
I see you're
familiar with
the territory.

1146
01:31:19.341 --> 01:31:22.311
Well, I am
a cop, remember?

1147
01:31:22.377 --> 01:31:24.243
Never forgot
it for a second.

1148
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.110
When did
you know?

1149
01:31:26.181 --> 01:31:29.879
I knew you were coming
up from Miami before
you did, Gaby.

1150
01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.350
See, Weber and /--

1151
01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:34.116
well, let's just
say we share the
same sources.

1152
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:35.588
Only I pay better.

1153
01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:37.421
(male pilot)
Sir, we're
good fo go.

1154
01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:39.755
So, why the help?

1155
01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.796
Maybe feeling guilty?

1156
01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:45.561
Guilt's not even
in my vocabulary.

1157
01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:49.126
I was just
hopin' you'd see
things differently.

1158
01:31:50.572 --> 01:31:52.939
Together you and I
could do anything.

1159
01:31:54.476 --> 01:31:57.605
Yeah. I
believe we did.

1160
01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:00.842
I'll get in
touch later on
if you're interested.

1161
01:32:00.915 --> 01:32:03.612
Meanwhile, I've got
to keep an appointment
with a man

1162
01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.380
who's gonna pay
very dearly

1163
01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:07.854
for something he's got
fo keep locked in
his basement

1164
01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:08.980
Just to say
it's his.

1165
01:32:11.059 --> 01:32:12.151
Good hunting, Gaby.

1166
01:32:12.227 --> 01:32:13.922
Wait, wait,
wait, wait,

1167
01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:15.861
Let me talk to her.
Just for a second.

1168
01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.193
That's him?

1169
01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:19.165
What makes you think
she's going anywhere?

1170
01:32:19.234 --> 01:32:20.793
She didn't commit
any crime.

1171
01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:23.668
She just lied
to someone who
was lying to her.

1172
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.214
You be good.

1173
01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:38.685
I'll try,
Uncle Keith.

1174
01:32:40.422 --> 01:32:44.552
Although I suspect
my legal career
Just ended.

1175
01:32:44.626 --> 01:32:46.253
Thank God.

1176
01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:19.492
[Russian accent]
You come in
here every night.

1177
01:33:19.561 --> 01:33:20.926
And every night
I tell you

1178
01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:24.522
I don't
know shit from
this, uh, Petrovich.

1179
01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:28.331
[burps]
This is a nightclub,
my friend.

1180
01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:30.064
You know
what I think?

1181
01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:35.167
I think you need to
check out the action,
and get your ass laid.

1182
01:33:35.243 --> 01:33:38.372
You know what
I'm sayin', dude?

1183
01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.039
Find yourself
a chick.

1184
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:57.590
Vodka.
[speaks Russian]

1185
01:33:57.665 --> 01:34:00.657
Russian hors d'oeuvres
to coat the stomach.

1186
01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:03.727
Oh. Does
my stomach
need coating?

1187
01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:06.035
I hope so.

1188
01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:08.474
I thought you
didn't drink.

1189
01:34:08.543 --> 01:34:10.307
You thought a
lot of things.

1190
01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:14.315
And I believe I
mentioned something
about making assumptions.

1191
01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:16.544
Maybe that's a
concept we should
get rid of.

1192
01:34:16.618 --> 01:34:17.608
Immediately.

1193
01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:19.710
My name is
Gabriel Martin.

1194
01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:23.223
I am from Miami.

1195
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:25.487
I was actually
looking for
a lawyer.

1196
01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.154
But the office
was, uh, closed.

1197
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:31.893
So, I came here.

1198
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.770
Okay.

1199
01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:42.276
My name is
Alexandra Korolenko.

1200
01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:45.506
And I come from
St. Petersburg.

1201
01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.605
By way of
Little Odessa.

1202
01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.643
And...

1203
01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:53.312
I love to dance.

1204
01:34:53.388 --> 01:34:57.222
So, I came
here tonight.

1205
01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:05.525
Do you wanna
dance with me?

1206
01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.092
Yeah.

1207
01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:14.205
I am willing to
make a fool
of myself.

1208
01:35:17.345 --> 01:35:18.608
Me too.

1209
01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:22.206
Alex.

1210
01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:23.648
Yeah?

1211
01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:26.710
That night when I
called you from
Coney Island,

1212
01:35:26.788 --> 01:35:29.553
you never
answered my question.

1213
01:35:29.624 --> 01:35:32.218
Which one?

1214
01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:34.660
I wanted--I
want to know--

1215
01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:40.025
was it all lies?

1216
01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:50.676
Not the part
that matters.

1217
01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.014
That was true.

1218
01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.718
It was real.
I felt that.

1219
01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:09.627
It was real.
Yeah, that was
real. Finally.
