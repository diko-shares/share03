1
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.260
The Russians think
they own the world now.

2
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.299
Especially those ones

3
00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.156
What, no town car?

4
00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.398
In our business,
it's better to be anonymous.

5
00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.158
I like town cars.

6
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:15.510
Excuse me, sir.

7
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
All right!

8
00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:32.086
I know, I know, I know. A gun.

9
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:36.132
It is dangerous for no one except you.

10
00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:38.009
You know what I want, don't you?

11
00:04:38.093 --> 00:04:39.761
Yes, sir.

12
00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:43.222
You're wasting time. Don't fuck with me.

13
00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.641
Open it. Open it!

14
00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.158
Open it!

15
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.334
Give me what I want.

16
00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:14.003
I don't understand.
I don't have andhing else.

17
00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:16.547
If a man's offering you
all that money, I'd take it.

18
00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:20.718
If I need financial advice,
I'll call my broker.

19
00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:22.261
- I'm just saying is all.
- Whatever.

20
00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.598
Take off your coat. Take off your coat!

21
00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:38.611
Now how hard was that?

22
00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:41.697
- Excuse me.
- Mister, I thought I told--

23
00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:46.953
What the--

24
00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.585
Don't do it! Move! Everybody down!

25
00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.381
Out of the way! Move!

26
00:05:58.465 --> 00:06:01.342
- Move! Get out of the way! Move!
- Get out of the way!

27
00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.689
Go, go, go, go.

28
00:06:15.607 --> 00:06:17.358
Desperate white or Hispanic male.

29
00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.027
Wearing a reflective vest.
He's on top of the cars.

30
00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:21.320
All units at Vernon Jackson.

31
00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.491
NYPD!

32
00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:31.080
Everybody down! Stay down!

33
00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:34.459
Other end!

34
00:06:50.184 --> 00:07:33.142
Move! Move!

35
00:07:33.227 --> 00:07:35.686
Everybody down!
Please get out of the platform now!

36
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:37.980
Come on! Face down!
Everybody off the train!

37
00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:40.900
Everybody get down. Sir, get down.

38
00:07:40.984 --> 00:07:42.944
Is anything wrong?

39
00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:45.488
- Officer. Officer.
- Move! Move!

40
00:07:45.572 --> 00:07:47.490
Come on, guys, get down!

41
00:07:47.574 --> 00:07:49.408
Down! Get your ass down!

42
00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.118
Down! Get down!

43
00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:54.288
Search the track.
He went down the tunnel?

44
00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:56.582
Check the tunnel. Check the roofs!

45
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:05.633
Come on, people.
Face down on the ground now.

46
00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:08.594
He jumped! He was on top of the roof.

47
00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:12.139
This train is closed! Nobody gets on!

48
00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:14.392
Sir, I need you to calm down.

49
00:08:14.476 --> 00:08:16.561
Get these people moving!

50
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:27.488
Stop right there.

51
00:08:30.367 --> 00:08:32.618
The punk's got balls.

52
00:08:32.703 --> 00:08:34.996
But no positive identification.

53
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.207
No. There's another camera
pointing at the platform.

54
00:08:44.298 --> 00:08:46.340
Michaels, stop it right there.

55
00:08:47.884 --> 00:08:49.260
You see what I see?

56
00:08:49.344 --> 00:08:51.846
- Maybe.
- That's him, Lieutenant.

57
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:52.972
That's who?

58
00:08:53.056 --> 00:08:54.932
How long you been a detective, Michaels?

59
00:08:55.017 --> 00:08:56.017
11 months, sir.

60
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.893
I'm 22 years in robbery homicide.

61
00:08:57.978 --> 00:09:01.188
One of your subcategories
of robbery is art theft.

62
00:09:01.273 --> 00:09:03.024
There's a lot of that in the Apple.

63
00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:04.609
Are you aware of that, Michaels?

64
00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:06.277
- I guess so, yeah.
- I wasn't.

65
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:09.655
When I was your age, I was quite happy
with regular murder and mayhem.

66
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.741
Lieutenant Weber minored
in art history at Fordham.

67
00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:12.825
Oh.

68
00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:15.870
Anyway, the Chief starts
calling me Lieutenant Picasso

69
00:09:15.954 --> 00:09:18.456
and puts me in charge
every time there is the theft

70
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.708
of as much as an Etch-A-Sketch.

71
00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:23.878
2 decades I've been
putting 'em all away.

72
00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:26.881
Everybody but him-- Keith Ripley.

73
00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:29.008
He's the best there is.

74
00:09:29.092 --> 00:09:30.760
Howdy, Keith.

75
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.832
You've been bad boy.

76
00:10:03.043 --> 00:10:06.671
- Perhaps I could give you 50.
- No.

77
00:10:06.755 --> 00:10:08.464
That is not possible.

78
00:10:08.548 --> 00:10:10.174
I wouldn't take less than 100.

79
00:10:10.258 --> 00:10:12.593
Oh, man.

80
00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.637
I'm just saying is all.

81
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:16.222
You.

82
00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:18.516
Mind if I borrow this?

83
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.976
Well, I may have wanted to use it.

84
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:23.521
- Mm.
- But yours will do.

85
00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:26.190
Will you please put down my gun?

86
00:10:26.274 --> 00:10:28.859
There's one thing
you should be aware of, Gabriel.

87
00:10:28.944 --> 00:10:31.612
Or do you prefer Seá¿†or Martin?

88
00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:34.365
The police cannot arrest you
for armed robbery

89
00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:35.908
if your gun isn't loaded.

90
00:10:35.992 --> 00:10:37.201
Your point?

91
00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:39.912
You think I'd walk around
with a loaded shotgun?

92
00:10:39.996 --> 00:10:41.872
Let's see.

93
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:45.793
You could have checked.

94
00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:49.380
Why? You have my diamonds,
my score, my money.

95
00:10:49.464 --> 00:10:52.883
Enjoy. Nice meeting you both. Bye.

96
00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:56.721
By the way, I was going to ask for 125.

97
00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:00.599
I'm just saying is all.

98
00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:01.934
Gabriel, stay.

99
00:11:02.018 --> 00:11:03.936
Why? What else do you want?

100
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.897
You gonna shoot me now?

101
00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:09.191
Well, in as much as
you did steal the diamonds,

102
00:11:09.276 --> 00:11:12.319
I figure it's only fair
to share the proceeds with you.

103
00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:16.866
So to what do I owe
this act of generosity?

104
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.035
I have a proposition
I wish to discuss with you.

105
00:11:23.915 --> 00:11:27.501
So, how did you know
I would come here,

106
00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.170
as well as my name?

107
00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:31.464
It's part of the proposition--

108
00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:34.884
Ah, shit.

109
00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:37.678
Come on.

110
00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.305
All right, take it easy, take it easy.

111
00:11:40.974 --> 00:11:42.683
Nicky would like his money.

112
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:46.103
- Ask him.
- Thank you.

113
00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:51.358
This is something between you and them.
Got nothing to do with me! Aah!

114
00:11:51.443 --> 00:11:53.611
Everything does now.

115
00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.364
Call this interest.

116
00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:59.450
Nicky is tired of waiting for you.

117
00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:11.879
You must have very bad karma.

118
00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:13.756
I actually don't believe in it.

119
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.508
Look, about this propos--

120
00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:17.134
No, no, no, no!

121
00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:19.011
You're totally out of your mind.

122
00:12:19.095 --> 00:12:20.596
Good night.

123
00:12:25.268 --> 00:12:26.852
- Hey.
- What?

124
00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:28.312
Here's your karma.

125
00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:33.275
What was in the other envelope?

126
00:12:34.444 --> 00:12:35.820
Your cut.

127
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.282
Now you've got mine.

128
00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:43.661
Whatever.

129
00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:45.204
Think about it.

130
00:12:45.288 --> 00:12:46.705
Yeah, sure, yeah.

131
00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:20.906
Now what do you want?

132
00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:23.868
A partner.

133
00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:28.122
What did you think
I was doing on that train?

134
00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:29.582
I was watching you work.

135
00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:34.461
I've been your shadow
ever since you got to town.

136
00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:38.299
So why were you in my town
robbing subways?

137
00:13:38.383 --> 00:13:40.843
It's hurricane season in Miami.

138
00:13:40.927 --> 00:13:42.803
I don't like hurricanes.

139
00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:45.723
Or you didn't feel like
going back to Angola.

140
00:13:47.267 --> 00:13:48.601
It's over.

141
00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:50.603
- Lesson learned.
- Look.

142
00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:52.771
Gabriel Martin is a rock star.

143
00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:56.942
So why were you holding
open-mike night on the subway

144
00:13:57.027 --> 00:13:59.528
for a lousy hundred grand?

145
00:13:59.613 --> 00:14:01.363
2 reasons.

146
00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:03.991
Yes, Miami was getting too hot.

147
00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:06.493
And perhaps you can relate to this.

148
00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:08.913
Sometimes--

149
00:14:10.206 --> 00:14:13.083
Sometimes you just need to feel the rush.

150
00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:18.756
The juice. Yeah.

151
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.591
You know what I mean.

152
00:14:21.718 --> 00:14:26.847
Yesterday you took down 2 jewelers
for a few stones from Romanov's.

153
00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.934
My idea is Romanov's itself.

154
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:32.186
Please.

155
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:37.983
Specifically, 2 Fabergé eggs
worth 20 million dollars...

156
00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:39.443
each.

157
00:14:41.821 --> 00:14:43.822
It's a 2-man job.

158
00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:47.743
Do I have your attention?

159
00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:10.975
Wait here.

160
00:15:12.644 --> 00:15:14.937
I hear they prefer cash.

161
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:16.772
Or your first-born.

162
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.132
Why don't you try The Standard instead?

163
00:15:47.262 --> 00:15:49.430
Jealous?

164
00:15:49.514 --> 00:15:50.848
Of who?

165
00:15:52.392 --> 00:15:54.226
The mystery bandit.

166
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.688
I'm afraid that type of thing
is not my style.

167
00:15:57.772 --> 00:16:02.192
Well, I think this guy's got panache, guts.

168
00:16:03.486 --> 00:16:07.072
And a passing resemblance,
at least in body type.

169
00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:11.785
Well, you don't have to rob trains
to have panache.

170
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.454
Or guts.

171
00:16:13.538 --> 00:16:16.582
But you've got to admit that kind of thing
immediately brands you.

172
00:16:16.606 --> 00:16:21.206
<says to Russian street vendor> I'd like to pay for the newspaper  please. Thank you "Spaceba" (means thank you in Russian)

173
00:16:21.254 --> 00:16:25.007
My treat. Too painful watching
you attempt to read Cyrillic.

174
00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:28.010
Oh, no, no, no. I was just, uh,
looking at the picture.

175
00:16:28.094 --> 00:16:29.678
So you are jealous.

176
00:16:31.264 --> 00:16:33.515
Yes. You got me there.

177
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.683
Absolutely.

178
00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:40.731
I've got to get this Chinese food to my boss,

179
00:16:40.815 --> 00:16:44.860
so, um...some other time.

180
00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:46.278
When some other time?

181
00:16:46.362 --> 00:16:47.738
I'll call you.

182
00:16:47.822 --> 00:16:50.991
But you don't have my number
or know my name or anything.

183
00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:53.619
- I guess that could be a problem.
- Gabriel.

184
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.997
- Oh, shit.
- Are you with him?

185
00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:59.208
I don't know. Should I? More or less.

186
00:16:59.292 --> 00:17:01.502
Uh, yes, I am.

187
00:17:01.586 --> 00:17:03.087
What do you want?

188
00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.757
Can't I bring my goddaughter
a birthday present?

189
00:17:06.841 --> 00:17:08.258
My birthday was last month.

190
00:17:08.343 --> 00:17:11.637
It was 2 weeks ago,
and I'm sorry it's late.

191
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:14.640
Alex, it's just a present. No strings.

192
00:17:16.142 --> 00:17:17.184
No, thanks.

193
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.688
Well, it was nice
to have almost met you, Gabriel.

194
00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:24.358
- Gaby.
- Gaby.

195
00:17:24.442 --> 00:17:27.820
It's a shame you don't keep
a higher class of company.

196
00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:36.411
Don't even think about it.

197
00:17:36.496 --> 00:17:38.122
Think about what?

198
00:17:38.206 --> 00:17:39.832
Going anywhere near her.

199
00:17:39.916 --> 00:17:41.375
I'll rip your heart out. I mean it.

200
00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:45.796
It looks like it's your heart
she's not so fond of.

201
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.215
You were warned. Let's go.

202
00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:50.926
I thought you said the target
was Romanov's.

203
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.845
This is research.

204
00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:53.971
Research?

205
00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:55.764
Oh, wow.

206
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.147
They're absolutely stunning.

207
00:18:05.775 --> 00:18:07.693
They are.

208
00:18:07.777 --> 00:18:10.696
Between 1885 and 1916,

209
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.949
Fabergé produced 50 of these
Easter eggs for the Empress

210
00:18:14.033 --> 00:18:16.535
and her daughter-in-law,
the Czarina Alexandra.

211
00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:18.203
Should I take notes?

212
00:18:18.288 --> 00:18:20.330
Will there be a quiz?

213
00:18:20.415 --> 00:18:23.667
No quiz, but there will be a test.

214
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:25.419
Okay.

215
00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:29.464
The Fabergés are all made
of precious metals and fine jewels.

216
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:32.092
Every one a unique masterpiece.

217
00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.260
Indeed.

218
00:18:33.344 --> 00:18:35.762
Most are on display in the Kremlin,

219
00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:39.600
the rest in private collections,
museums, or lost.

220
00:18:39.684 --> 00:18:43.145
In this case, at Romanov's.

221
00:18:43.229 --> 00:18:45.189
Who is your buyer?

222
00:18:45.273 --> 00:18:46.815
You don't want to know.

223
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.277
Oh, I'm stealing 40 million dollars'
worth of eggs, so I want to know.

224
00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:52.988
I also want to know
why these particular eggs

225
00:18:53.072 --> 00:18:55.657
are even worth 40 million dollars.

226
00:18:55.742 --> 00:18:59.077
Because no one knows they exist.

227
00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:00.412
Oh.

228
00:19:00.496 --> 00:19:02.581
The so-called mystery eggs?

229
00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:08.045
Yeah, I've heard rumors,
but I thought it was just a myth.

230
00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:12.382
Last year, they turned up
at Romanov's.

231
00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:14.343
So how do you know this?

232
00:19:14.427 --> 00:19:18.972
I was partners with a man named
Victor Korolenko-- Alex' father.

233
00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:21.266
He was in tight with the Russians.

234
00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:24.144
What they knew, he knew.

235
00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:26.939
So, why aren't you
pulling this job with him?

236
00:19:27.023 --> 00:19:29.775
Let's just say he's no longer around.

237
00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:32.027
Leave it at that.

238
00:19:35.573 --> 00:19:38.075
He's gone.

239
00:19:38.159 --> 00:19:39.409
You're here.

240
00:19:40.954 --> 00:19:43.413
Now we just have to deliver.

241
00:19:45.583 --> 00:19:48.085
Ripley.

242
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:50.087
Why?

243
00:19:50.171 --> 00:19:53.215
Why risk your freedom at all?

244
00:19:53.299 --> 00:19:55.300
This will not be anything close to easy.

245
00:19:55.385 --> 00:19:57.386
You are not in jail in the present.

246
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.179
Are you not comfortable?

247
00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:00.931
I'm never comfortable.

248
00:20:02.141 --> 00:20:05.978
Some people were born to compose music,

249
00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:08.355
others to split the atom.

250
00:20:10.525 --> 00:20:13.277
I was born to steal shit.

251
00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:17.406
Hold out your hand.

252
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:20.075
Hand?

253
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:29.001
That coin was given to me by Victor
when we became partners.

254
00:20:29.085 --> 00:20:31.753
The coin represents a Russian phrase--

255
00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:33.672
Vorovoslky mir.

256
00:20:33.756 --> 00:20:37.884
Loosely translated, thieves' world.

257
00:20:37.969 --> 00:20:39.636
Victor belonged to it.

258
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:44.182
Now...you belong to it.

259
00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.931
Psst. Hey.

260
00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:26.808
You misunderstand.

261
00:21:26.893 --> 00:21:28.727
Ripley's just, uh, business.

262
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:30.604
This is, uh--

263
00:21:30.688 --> 00:21:32.189
Stalking?

264
00:21:33.608 --> 00:21:37.152
Well, if you had given me your number,
I would have called first.

265
00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:41.490
Those are 2 very flawed assumptions.

266
00:21:41.574 --> 00:21:42.908
Do you have a vase?

267
00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:45.327
I just took these
from a roadside shrine,

268
00:21:45.411 --> 00:21:48.080
and I think they need some, uh, water.

269
00:21:48.164 --> 00:21:52.584
Uh, may I use that, uh, thing over there?

270
00:21:52.668 --> 00:21:54.169
Yeah.

271
00:21:55.171 --> 00:22:00.384
I-- I've noticed this, uh, Russian nightclub
down the block--

272
00:22:00.468 --> 00:22:02.928
uh, Riga Rose or something like that.

273
00:22:03.012 --> 00:22:05.138
Why don't we meet there after work?

274
00:22:10.561 --> 00:22:12.187
I'm busy.

275
00:22:12.271 --> 00:22:14.147
I'll wait.

276
00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:16.191
I won't show.

277
00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:18.402
I'll take my chances.

278
00:22:21.572 --> 00:22:24.408
Do svidanja, Alexandra.

279
00:22:25.785 --> 00:22:27.285
Research. Keith Ripley.

280
00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:29.830
'93-- the Brooklyn Museum,

281
00:22:29.914 --> 00:22:31.832
'94-- the Diamond District Warehouse,

282
00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:33.041
and then in '95--

283
00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:36.503
I'm very familiar
with Ripley's life story, Michaels.

284
00:22:36.587 --> 00:22:39.965
In fact, I busted him twice.

285
00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:42.634
Both times he walked
because of good lawyering.

286
00:22:42.718 --> 00:22:45.512
Exactly, so I thought
why not swing for the fences?

287
00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:47.472
Murder 1, Victor Korolenko.

288
00:22:47.557 --> 00:22:50.517
Thinking of the Brighton Beach Steam Baths?
Forget it. There was no--

289
00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:52.436
No body, I know.
But we got a ton of forensics.

290
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.396
- And no witnesses.
- Uh--

291
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.523
Nobody there admitted to seeing a thing.

292
00:22:56.607 --> 00:23:00.193
I was this close to convincing Korolenko
to take witness protection

293
00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:02.404
in exchange for giving up Ripley.

294
00:23:02.488 --> 00:23:05.073
But Ripley got to him first.

295
00:23:05.158 --> 00:23:06.741
I can't prove it.

296
00:23:06.826 --> 00:23:09.119
Right, okay. I see, I see. Okay.

297
00:23:09.203 --> 00:23:11.872
No. What you don't see, Michaels,

298
00:23:11.956 --> 00:23:15.167
is why Ripley got involved
in a small-time caper

299
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:18.420
like grabbing a few diamonds
off of some couriers on a subway.

300
00:23:18.504 --> 00:23:22.924
And neither did I
until I read the Dutch guy's statement.

301
00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:27.053
Those diamonds came from Romanov's.

302
00:23:27.138 --> 00:23:32.309
You mean, like, Ripley and his new partner
are planning to take down Romanov's?

303
00:23:32.393 --> 00:23:35.061
Ah, come on.
Like that could ever happen.

304
00:23:35.146 --> 00:23:37.022
Not even Ripley
could take down a place like that.

305
00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.151
Want to bet?

306
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.222
- Hi.
- Hi.

307
00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:11.515
You know this place very well.

308
00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:13.600
I never said I didn't.

309
00:24:13.684 --> 00:24:15.977
And let's face it,
you didn't see the nightclub.

310
00:24:16.062 --> 00:24:19.814
You saw the flyer in the fax,
and then you made an assumption.

311
00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:23.026
Yeah. Guilty. So I did.

312
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.113
Never assume andhing,
especially down here.

313
00:24:27.198 --> 00:24:29.032
How mysterious.

314
00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:30.450
What?

315
00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:32.327
How mysterious.

316
00:24:32.411 --> 00:24:34.829
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I don't drink.

317
00:24:34.914 --> 00:24:37.165
Another assumption.

318
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.002
You want to dance?

319
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.132
Yeah.

320
00:24:46.217 --> 00:24:48.468
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.

321
00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:50.053
Why not?

322
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.278
Here.

323
00:25:48.362 --> 00:25:49.696
Spasiba.

324
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.072
And for him.

325
00:25:51.157 --> 00:25:52.907
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

326
00:25:52.992 --> 00:25:54.868
I thought all Russians drank.

327
00:25:54.952 --> 00:25:58.413
Translation, we're a race
of suicidal alcoholics.

328
00:25:58.497 --> 00:26:00.582
No. I didn't mean that. No.

329
00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:02.167
Actually, we are.

330
00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:03.585
Cheers.

331
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:05.086
Nastaravia.

332
00:26:05.171 --> 00:26:06.588
Nostrovia.

333
00:26:06.672 --> 00:26:08.006
Nostrovia?

334
00:26:09.342 --> 00:26:14.137
So, how is it, working for the lawyer?

335
00:26:15.556 --> 00:26:17.557
- I'm a lawyer, too, you know.
- Oh.

336
00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:21.686
Maybe I won't say another word
because everything I assume is wrong.

337
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:24.939
- Well, you don't know until you try.
- True.

338
00:26:25.024 --> 00:26:28.068
Besides, my father warned me
about being a lawyer.

339
00:26:28.152 --> 00:26:31.571
He told me I should try and do
something honest with my life.

340
00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:33.615
As if he would know.

341
00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:37.118
Your father and Ripley,

342
00:26:37.203 --> 00:26:39.120
they were close, right?

343
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.749
Once upon a time.

344
00:26:45.795 --> 00:26:48.546
I'm sure Ripley told you my father's dead.

345
00:26:49.965 --> 00:26:53.968
Now Ripley likes to try to take care of me,

346
00:26:54.053 --> 00:26:56.638
pay for stuff, that kind of thing.

347
00:26:56.722 --> 00:26:59.766
Of course, it's the least he can do.

348
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.603
Sorry. I don't mean to pry.

349
00:27:09.485 --> 00:27:11.111
Yes, you do.

350
00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:17.117
Now who is making assumptions?

351
00:27:17.201 --> 00:27:21.788
No, Gaby. I'm not assuming a thing.

352
00:27:37.513 --> 00:27:39.806
You want to know about Ripley?

353
00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:43.727
Stay away.

354
00:28:22.975 --> 00:28:25.226
You son of a bitch.

355
00:28:26.937 --> 00:28:29.689
Well, you dropped these,

356
00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:33.443
and I am a gentleman
bringing them back to you.

357
00:28:40.284 --> 00:28:41.910
No, no, no.

358
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.789
No.

359
00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:39.759
Oh! Shit, man! What do you want?

360
00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:42.846
I told you to leave her alone.

361
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.682
I'm not gonna tell you again.

362
00:29:45.766 --> 00:29:49.102
Get dressed. I'll be downstairs.

363
00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.528
Son of a bitch.

364
00:30:03.033 --> 00:30:04.659
Fascinating.

365
00:30:06.412 --> 00:30:09.873
You could start a whole new trend
in interior design.

366
00:30:12.751 --> 00:30:14.043
What are these?

367
00:30:14.128 --> 00:30:15.420
What do they look like?

368
00:30:15.504 --> 00:30:16.838
Police lDs?

369
00:30:16.922 --> 00:30:22.218
There's a reception at Romanov's
tonight, honoring the NYPD.

370
00:30:22.303 --> 00:30:25.471
And our invitation's just arrived.

371
00:30:25.556 --> 00:30:26.806
A cop for the night.

372
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:29.183
And all the doughnuts you can eat.

373
00:30:29.268 --> 00:30:32.312
Meanwhile, however,
I need you to go to the dry cleaners.

374
00:30:32.396 --> 00:30:36.149
Why don't you go and pick up
your dry cleaning yourself, sir?

375
00:30:36.233 --> 00:30:38.192
Who said andhing about picking up?

376
00:30:39.778 --> 00:30:41.529
You're dropping off.

377
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.003
Hello.

378
00:31:20.861 --> 00:31:22.528
Cell phone, please.

379
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.237
Come on, Sergeev,
we have as the Americans say...

380
00:31:49.616 --> 00:31:51.198
networking to go.

381
00:31:53.268 --> 00:31:54.268
Commissioner Rawls.

382
00:31:54.353 --> 00:31:55.395
- Sir.
- Gentlemen.

383
00:31:55.479 --> 00:31:57.063
Deputy Commissioner Morelli.

384
00:31:57.147 --> 00:31:59.232
Such a pleasure having you here.

385
00:31:59.316 --> 00:32:01.734
May we give you gentlemen
the grand tour?

386
00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:03.361
The secrets of Romanov?

387
00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:04.529
You might say so.

388
00:32:04.613 --> 00:32:06.447
- Thank you. We're honored.
- Please.

389
00:32:11.912 --> 00:32:14.664
The guards, all FSB secret police.

390
00:32:14.748 --> 00:32:18.084
Every door, every inch of glass
wired and alarmed.

391
00:32:18.168 --> 00:32:22.755
So even if a bird flies in here,
you know about it.

392
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.340
Topkapi.

393
00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:25.967
Rififi.

394
00:32:26.051 --> 00:32:30.179
No. The bird flew into the museum,
landed on the wire,

395
00:32:30.264 --> 00:32:32.390
and set off the alarm in Topkapi.

396
00:32:32.474 --> 00:32:34.142
You're a cineaste.

397
00:32:34.226 --> 00:32:38.604
Actually, I only see heist movies.

398
00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:42.108
Well, the lesson to take away
from the bird flying into the museum

399
00:32:42.192 --> 00:32:46.988
is no matter how well you planned,
always be ready to improvise

400
00:32:47.072 --> 00:32:49.782
because I guarantee you,
something's gonna go wrong.

401
00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:52.201
I'd prefer to avoid that.

402
00:32:52.286 --> 00:32:55.663
How comprehensive
is the surveillance system?

403
00:32:55.748 --> 00:32:57.081
Let's take a look.

404
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:03.304
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

405
00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:06.185
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

406
00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:07.477
Check.

407
00:33:19.104 --> 00:33:21.689
- Smart card for the elevator.
- And all the doors.

408
00:33:21.774 --> 00:33:22.774
This way. After you.

409
00:33:23.776 --> 00:33:24.984
We're on.

410
00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:30.239
Good to see you, old friend.
Let me introduce you.

411
00:33:31.241 --> 00:33:32.241
Nice to meet you.

412
00:33:32.326 --> 00:33:35.828
Lieutenant Weber, I presume.

413
00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:39.874
You know, Ripley,
identity theft is a serious crime.

414
00:33:39.958 --> 00:33:42.919
- And quite an embarrassing one in this case.
- Really?

415
00:33:43.003 --> 00:33:45.463
Do you realize how ashamed I felt

416
00:33:45.547 --> 00:33:48.257
telling that nice young lady at the door
that I was still a lieutenant?

417
00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:50.301
I mean at my age?

418
00:33:50.385 --> 00:33:52.095
Or should I say at your age?

419
00:33:52.179 --> 00:33:53.679
I'm not amused.

420
00:33:53.764 --> 00:33:55.264
What are you doing here?

421
00:33:55.349 --> 00:33:58.893
And why did you appropriate
my invitation? As if I didn't know.

422
00:33:58.977 --> 00:34:01.062
I apologize for the subterfuge.

423
00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:04.565
I just wanted to show my friend here
some of the finer things in life.

424
00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:08.361
Of course, if you want to arrest us
for impersonating police officers,

425
00:34:08.445 --> 00:34:09.529
go right ahead.

426
00:34:09.613 --> 00:34:11.614
I'm sure my lawyer
will have us out in 2 hours.

427
00:34:11.698 --> 00:34:14.951
It would be a delightful 2 hours.
Get your hands down.

428
00:34:15.035 --> 00:34:18.704
Then there's all that explaining
you'd have to do to your superiors.

429
00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:20.623
Now, that would be an embarrassment.

430
00:34:20.707 --> 00:34:25.128
Notorious thief gaining admittance
pretending to be you.

431
00:34:25.212 --> 00:34:27.046
Great police work, Weber.

432
00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:29.841
We should discuss my police work
when this is all over.

433
00:34:31.009 --> 00:34:33.136
Who's your sidekick?

434
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.929
Jules Dassin.

435
00:34:35.013 --> 00:34:36.973
Good to meet you, Jules.

436
00:34:37.057 --> 00:34:39.517
I love your movies.

437
00:34:39.601 --> 00:34:43.688
Enjoy the party, gents, while it lasts.

438
00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:50.403
Now, do you mind telling me
what that was all about?

439
00:34:50.487 --> 00:34:52.280
Just a cop.

440
00:34:52.364 --> 00:34:54.031
Really? No kidding.

441
00:34:55.325 --> 00:34:59.579
We have been made in the very place
we are supposed to take down.

442
00:34:59.663 --> 00:35:01.914
Exactly how do you stay out ofjail?

443
00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:07.670
Unless, of course, you and this Weber
are partners trying to set me up.

444
00:35:08.714 --> 00:35:10.214
Are you, Ripley?

445
00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:12.091
The elevator, gentlemen.

446
00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:14.385
- Okay.
- Here we go.

447
00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:16.179
Come on. Move your damn ass.

448
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.977
Weber has no idea what we're here for.

449
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:24.395
Of course he does.

450
00:35:24.479 --> 00:35:26.898
He doesn't know when,
and he doesn't know how.

451
00:35:26.982 --> 00:35:28.816
And no, he doesn't know about the eggs.

452
00:35:28.901 --> 00:35:30.234
No one does. Here.

453
00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:32.153
The best way to neutralize Weber

454
00:35:32.237 --> 00:35:34.655
is to fuel his obsession with busting me.

455
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:39.118
He is so blinded by it, he no longer
thinks like a cop. Trust me.

456
00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:41.454
Give me a good reason to, huh?

457
00:35:41.538 --> 00:35:44.707
I already gave you 40 million
good reasons. Here.

458
00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.462
Now that you've seen what the public sees,
it's time for the real treat.

459
00:35:49.546 --> 00:35:53.174
That is, of course, as long as you promise
not to come back and rob us.

460
00:35:53.258 --> 00:35:55.384
I guess I won't take any notes, then.

461
00:35:58.847 --> 00:36:00.848
Our main vault.

462
00:36:00.933 --> 00:36:03.142
Gregor, disarm the motion detectors.

463
00:36:03.227 --> 00:36:05.645
As you will see, even with
the knowledge of all protocols,

464
00:36:05.729 --> 00:36:07.897
it is absolutely impregnable.

465
00:36:07.981 --> 00:36:10.650
The voice sensors ask
our head of security, Boris Sergeev,

466
00:36:10.734 --> 00:36:13.527
a random set of pre-recorded words.

467
00:36:13.612 --> 00:36:16.572
But this is only half the process.

468
00:36:16.657 --> 00:36:20.910
We also have a biometric handprint sensor.

469
00:36:20.994 --> 00:36:24.372
Since Mr. Sergeev and I are
the only ones who have clearance,

470
00:36:24.456 --> 00:36:26.958
we must both be present to open the vaults.

471
00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:29.961
Once I activate
the biometric handprint sensor,

472
00:36:30.045 --> 00:36:32.338
he must activate the voice sensor.

473
00:36:32.422 --> 00:36:35.299
This way, neither of us
can steal from the other.

474
00:36:35.384 --> 00:36:38.636
Well, you better hope
Mr. Sergeev stays healthy.

475
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.137
Yeah.

476
00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:42.223
I must stay healthy as well.

477
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.399
Hamburger.

478
00:36:51.483 --> 00:36:55.152
Hamburger.

479
00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:56.988
Big Apple.

480
00:36:57.072 --> 00:36:58.489
Big Apple.

481
00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:07.373
Jesus Christ.

482
00:37:07.457 --> 00:37:10.793
The vault door automatically
resets on the hour,

483
00:37:10.877 --> 00:37:14.213
at which point the sensors
must be activated in reverse.

484
00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:18.050
All in all, gentlemen,
best not to get locked inside.

485
00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:20.594
Well, did I say it was gonna be easy?

486
00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:24.390
No, but you didn't say
it would be impossible, either.

487
00:37:24.474 --> 00:37:26.100
Armored glass.

488
00:37:26.184 --> 00:37:30.604
It would take a half an hour
to break through just one case.

489
00:37:30.689 --> 00:37:34.400
But I'm afraid whoever tried
wouldn't even have half a second

490
00:37:34.484 --> 00:37:38.195
because an ultrasonic motion detector
would automatically lock him in

491
00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:39.989
and trigger the alarm.

492
00:37:40.073 --> 00:37:41.574
Containment security, gentlemen.

493
00:37:41.658 --> 00:37:43.743
Getting in is highly improbable,

494
00:37:43.827 --> 00:37:46.162
but getting out is frankly impossible.

495
00:37:46.246 --> 00:37:47.747
Where does that door lead?

496
00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:51.375
To our inner vault, which contains
our most precious items.

497
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.295
I'm sorry, but security prevents me

498
00:37:54.379 --> 00:37:56.130
from taking even this
distinguished group in there.

499
00:37:56.214 --> 00:37:58.341
Now we'll proceed back to the reception,

500
00:37:58.425 --> 00:38:00.760
but before we do,
I'd like to once again thank you both

501
00:38:00.844 --> 00:38:04.055
for your generosity this last year
in helping set up our business.

502
00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:06.307
And thank you very much
for the donation of that chopper.

503
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:07.641
You're very welcome.

504
00:38:08.727 --> 00:38:11.520
Let's go. We can do this, Gabriel.

505
00:38:11.605 --> 00:38:14.607
No. Absolutely not.

506
00:38:14.691 --> 00:38:16.942
It was a pleasure. Goodbye.

507
00:38:17.027 --> 00:38:18.277
Wait a minute. Wait.

508
00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:21.322
Nobody's going anywhere yet.

509
00:38:21.406 --> 00:38:24.325
If Zykov finds that camera,
he's gonna know what it is.

510
00:38:24.409 --> 00:38:26.535
They'll change all the protocols.

511
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:31.749
Which part of "I don't give a shit"
do you not understand?

512
00:38:49.142 --> 00:38:52.353
- Sorry. Let me just--
- I'll handle it.

513
00:38:52.437 --> 00:38:53.479
- I've got it. I've got it.
- No, no, no.

514
00:38:53.563 --> 00:38:55.898
Please, please. Allow me.

515
00:38:55.982 --> 00:38:57.817
- I'm absolutely okay.
- I apologize, sir.

516
00:39:37.607 --> 00:39:41.402
What the fuck?

517
00:39:41.486 --> 00:39:44.905
Detective Weber, I'm Hal Donley,
special agent in charge of this op.

518
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.242
We understand you're conducting
an investigation of a potential theft

519
00:39:48.326 --> 00:39:50.411
that you assume is going down
at Romanov Jewelers.

520
00:39:50.495 --> 00:39:52.455
Assume, my ass.

521
00:39:52.539 --> 00:39:55.458
I know it's going down,
and I know who's pulling it off.

522
00:39:55.542 --> 00:39:58.335
Except we're asking you
to call off your dogs.

523
00:39:58.462 --> 00:40:00.463
There are other matters
that take precedence.

524
00:40:00.547 --> 00:40:02.548
What could possibly take precedence

525
00:40:02.632 --> 00:40:05.092
over the potential theft
of millions of dollars in diamonds

526
00:40:05.177 --> 00:40:10.556
from a company that donates tons
of money and equipment to the NYPD?

527
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.558
Valentin?

528
00:40:12.642 --> 00:40:15.519
Vitaly Zykov, in the old Soviet days,

529
00:40:15.604 --> 00:40:18.606
was the right-hand man
to a party boss named Dimitri Kuzin.

530
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:24.028
Kuzin set up a supposedly independent
Russian diamond center in America.

531
00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:26.489
Romanov's.

532
00:40:26.573 --> 00:40:30.201
But diamonds--

533
00:40:30.285 --> 00:40:31.911
they're not all
that he's shipping over here.

534
00:40:31.995 --> 00:40:34.079
He's ripping off
the Russian Treasury, Detective.

535
00:40:34.164 --> 00:40:37.124
Gold, gems, artworks.

536
00:40:37.209 --> 00:40:39.418
Gentlemen, where do you think
Romanov's got the money

537
00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:42.838
to buy your department a helicopter
and now police cars?

538
00:40:42.923 --> 00:40:44.798
From retail diamond sales?

539
00:40:44.883 --> 00:40:46.550
So why are they doing this?

540
00:40:46.635 --> 00:40:48.177
Is that a serious question?

541
00:40:49.888 --> 00:40:52.348
So the NYPD will leave them alone.

542
00:40:52.432 --> 00:40:54.850
That's their mindset.

543
00:40:57.521 --> 00:41:00.064
We need more time
to build our mutual cases.

544
00:41:00.148 --> 00:41:02.608
That's why we can't have
any other investigations

545
00:41:02.692 --> 00:41:04.735
potentially alerting Zykov.

546
00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:11.325
Lieutenant...

547
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.702
shut it down.

548
00:41:15.747 --> 00:41:16.914
Gentlemen.

549
00:41:16.998 --> 00:41:18.874
Commissioner.

550
00:41:21.211 --> 00:41:23.921
Just in case you think
you're smarter than us,

551
00:41:24.005 --> 00:41:27.216
decide to continue this investigation
on a down and low,

552
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.384
forget it.

553
00:41:28.468 --> 00:41:31.345
This is bigger than you and your ego.

554
00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:32.555
Do you get it?

555
00:41:33.765 --> 00:41:35.307
I get it.

556
00:41:38.728 --> 00:41:40.229
What did the feds have to say?

557
00:41:40.313 --> 00:41:43.816
Nothing. Everything's still a go.

558
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.568
The first order of business

559
00:41:45.652 --> 00:41:47.987
is to bypass the security cameras.

560
00:41:48.071 --> 00:41:52.199
If we can gain access into
the surveillance system,

561
00:41:52.284 --> 00:41:55.703
we can replace the light feed
with a continuous loop of study shots

562
00:41:55.787 --> 00:41:57.830
with no face inside.

563
00:41:57.914 --> 00:42:02.543
That still leaves the voice sensors,
the fingerprints, the motion detectors,

564
00:42:02.627 --> 00:42:06.171
and the meanest-looking vault door
I have ever seen in my life.

565
00:42:27.402 --> 00:42:28.902
The inner vault door--

566
00:42:28.987 --> 00:42:31.322
Swiss-made, 3 feet thick,

567
00:42:31.406 --> 00:42:33.866
with spring-driven relocking bolts.

568
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.077
If you punch out the lock,
they block retraction

569
00:42:37.162 --> 00:42:39.830
so that you couldn't open it
even if you knew the combination.

570
00:42:39.914 --> 00:42:42.124
Abraham Lincoln.

571
00:42:42.208 --> 00:42:43.584
Broadway.

572
00:42:43.668 --> 00:42:45.169
Broadway.

573
00:42:45.253 --> 00:42:46.837
30 pre-recorded words.

574
00:42:46.921 --> 00:42:48.422
One week, we've got them all.

575
00:42:48.506 --> 00:42:50.049
Dan McWilliams, MTA.

576
00:42:50.133 --> 00:42:52.051
Yes, we're going to be doing
some maintenance work

577
00:42:52.135 --> 00:42:54.845
in the subway adjacent
to your basement next week.

578
00:42:54.929 --> 00:42:59.433
We'll be working nights and didn't want
the drilling and what all to alarm you.

579
00:43:19.663 --> 00:43:22.456
You place an ultrasonic transducer here,

580
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.377
broadcasting at the exact operating
frequency of the transmitter,

581
00:43:26.461 --> 00:43:29.505
and it bounces back
the frequency to the unit,

582
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:31.090
at least in theory.

583
00:43:31.174 --> 00:43:33.801
Have you ever used
an ultrasonic transducer?

584
00:43:33.885 --> 00:43:35.010
Nope.

585
00:43:35.095 --> 00:43:37.721
Can you get an ultrasonic transducer?

586
00:43:37.806 --> 00:43:39.598
I can get anything, my friend.

587
00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:41.141
Can you get past a keypad?

588
00:43:41.226 --> 00:43:44.103
It is, as always, a question of time.

589
00:43:44.187 --> 00:43:45.979
One tumbler at a time.

590
00:43:46.064 --> 00:43:50.150
It is tight, but possible.

591
00:44:07.335 --> 00:44:08.419
You.

592
00:44:09.421 --> 00:44:11.171
Yeah.

593
00:44:11.256 --> 00:44:12.798
Me.

594
00:44:21.391 --> 00:44:23.267
What's so funny?

595
00:44:24.394 --> 00:44:26.770
I hate Chinese food.

596
00:44:26.855 --> 00:44:31.024
I absolutely, unequivocally,

597
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:36.321
irrevocably loathe Chinese food.

598
00:44:36.406 --> 00:44:37.406
Oh.

599
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:42.202
Leonid, my boss,
is addicted to Chinese food.

600
00:44:42.287 --> 00:44:45.080
- Oh.
- I can't even stand the smell.

601
00:44:45.165 --> 00:44:48.000
Another completely wrong assumption.

602
00:44:48.084 --> 00:44:50.419
No.

603
00:44:50.503 --> 00:44:53.046
It's not completely...

604
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:54.256
wrong.

605
00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:00.763
What?

606
00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:09.980
Wow.

607
00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.071
You stole this.

608
00:45:18.156 --> 00:45:19.239
Yes, I did.

609
00:45:19.324 --> 00:45:20.991
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

610
00:45:21.075 --> 00:45:22.493
That's what I do.

611
00:46:07.038 --> 00:46:08.330
Wait.

612
00:46:41.072 --> 00:46:43.031
We have a problem.

613
00:46:44.576 --> 00:46:46.034
The bracelet?

614
00:46:47.495 --> 00:46:49.329
I cannot return it.

615
00:46:51.082 --> 00:46:54.042
No. I like it.

616
00:46:55.128 --> 00:46:58.547
So what could possibly be a problem?

617
00:46:58.631 --> 00:47:00.841
You.

618
00:47:00.925 --> 00:47:03.427
- What?
- Me.

619
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:06.555
I thought that part was not a problem.

620
00:47:06.639 --> 00:47:08.599
And Ripley.

621
00:47:08.683 --> 00:47:10.225
That part is a problem.

622
00:47:11.227 --> 00:47:15.022
Yours and Ripley's
is a world I just can't trust.

623
00:47:18.401 --> 00:47:22.029
How did your father die?

624
00:47:22.113 --> 00:47:24.573
By gunshot.

625
00:47:24.657 --> 00:47:26.617
Who did it?

626
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:31.496
He had gambling debts to a Russian
gangster named Nicky Petrovich.

627
00:47:33.416 --> 00:47:34.499
Nicky wants his money.

628
00:47:34.584 --> 00:47:35.868
Ask him.

629
00:47:36.252 --> 00:47:39.338
This concept of, uh, vorovosky...

630
00:47:39.422 --> 00:47:40.547
Vorovosky mir.

631
00:47:40.632 --> 00:47:42.466
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

632
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.719
Where one is responsible
for the debts of another one.

633
00:47:45.803 --> 00:47:50.641
Uh, why would they kill your father
and let Ripley live?

634
00:47:50.725 --> 00:47:54.394
Because Ripley has-- I don't know.
How do you want me to put this?

635
00:47:54.479 --> 00:47:55.729
Earning power.

636
00:47:58.733 --> 00:48:01.526
Gaby,

637
00:48:01.611 --> 00:48:04.780
I don't want to go to any more funerals.

638
00:48:08.993 --> 00:48:11.119
I want to be with you,

639
00:48:11.204 --> 00:48:13.163
but I can't promise you that,

640
00:48:13.247 --> 00:48:16.583
and you can't promise me a thing,

641
00:48:16.668 --> 00:48:21.380
so maybe we shouldn't even try.

642
00:48:28.763 --> 00:48:31.431
Oh, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

643
00:48:35.311 --> 00:48:36.687
Get in.

644
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.116
I know you don't want to.
I know you don't mean to.

645
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.450
But you will hurt her.

646
00:48:50.535 --> 00:48:53.412
She doesn't need any more of that.

647
00:48:53.496 --> 00:48:58.792
None of which you had
anything to do with. Am I right?

648
00:48:58.876 --> 00:49:01.253
Is there something you want to ask me?

649
00:49:03.339 --> 00:49:05.173
Yes.

650
00:49:05.258 --> 00:49:09.428
Why is Victor dead
and you're still walking around?

651
00:49:11.889 --> 00:49:16.435
I'm sure Alex told you that Victor was
in deep to a man named Nicky Petrovich.

652
00:49:16.519 --> 00:49:19.229
What she didn't know
was Nicky was ready to forgive the dept

653
00:49:19.313 --> 00:49:22.107
if Victor pulled a job-- this job.

654
00:49:22.191 --> 00:49:24.568
- Victor backed out?
- He was trying to protect Alex.

655
00:49:24.652 --> 00:49:26.153
Made a deal with Weber.

656
00:49:26.237 --> 00:49:28.447
He was gonna drop the dime on Nicky.

657
00:49:28.531 --> 00:49:29.823
And you.

658
00:49:29.907 --> 00:49:31.074
And me.

659
00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:33.660
Weber offered Victor witness protection--

660
00:49:33.745 --> 00:49:35.871
he and Alex, but Alex didn't want to go.

661
00:49:35.955 --> 00:49:38.999
Victor didn't want to go without her, so...

662
00:49:39.083 --> 00:49:41.084
he bought a bullet instead.

663
00:49:41.169 --> 00:49:42.836
So then why is this still your problem?

664
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.255
Why don't you just leave?

665
00:49:45.339 --> 00:49:49.426
You don't make a deal with Nicky Petrovich
and then walk away.

666
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.344
There's no statute of limitations.

667
00:49:51.429 --> 00:49:53.847
Nicky wants those eggs.

668
00:49:53.931 --> 00:49:55.891
Victor's share
would have paid off his debt.

669
00:49:57.643 --> 00:49:59.352
Victor and I were partners.

670
00:49:59.437 --> 00:50:01.104
He was responsible for me.

671
00:50:01.189 --> 00:50:04.858
So now I'm responsible for him and his debt.

672
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.278
Bullshit.

673
00:50:08.362 --> 00:50:10.197
Victor is dead. Just walk away.

674
00:50:10.281 --> 00:50:13.200
- That's not an option.
- Oh, wow. This is just--

675
00:50:14.452 --> 00:50:15.619
Look.

676
00:50:17.246 --> 00:50:18.914
We do the job.

677
00:50:18.998 --> 00:50:20.749
Nicky gets his cut.

678
00:50:20.833 --> 00:50:22.209
I take a small chunk,

679
00:50:22.293 --> 00:50:25.045
nowhere near commensurate
with my risk,

680
00:50:25.129 --> 00:50:27.130
and you clear a cool 20 million.

681
00:50:27.215 --> 00:50:30.092
I don't know. This is--

682
00:50:30.176 --> 00:50:33.512
Look, either we pull this job off flawlessly,

683
00:50:33.596 --> 00:50:36.431
or you call Weber
and you ask for witness protection,

684
00:50:36.516 --> 00:50:38.475
which isn't a choice at all

685
00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:40.936
because Nicky will find you,
and he will kill you.

686
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.773
It doesn't matter where you go
or how long it takes.

687
00:50:44.857 --> 00:50:47.109
That's an unalterable fact.

688
00:50:55.368 --> 00:50:57.536
Well, uh...

689
00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:04.501
then we steal the fucking eggs.

690
00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:05.836
No?

691
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.046
Yes.

692
00:51:11.008 --> 00:51:12.884
Oh, shit.

693
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:16.304
All right, we are working on it, mami culos,

694
00:51:16.389 --> 00:51:19.057
so back off, please. Thank you.

695
00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:21.601
I think he called us a name.

696
00:51:23.187 --> 00:51:25.981
We do not like to be insulted.

697
00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:29.442
All right.

698
00:52:48.648 --> 00:52:52.108
Do you know the significance
of this coin?

699
00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:54.486
Yeah.

700
00:52:56.489 --> 00:53:00.992
Then you must know, by the mere fact
that you have it in your possession,

701
00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:05.830
I cannot assume the two of you
will not attempt to double-cross me.

702
00:53:05.915 --> 00:53:10.001
Nobody's gonna try to double-cross you,
Nicky. We've been trying to--

703
00:53:12.046 --> 00:53:14.047
Nicky.

704
00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:18.218
- Alex, I'm so sorry.

705
00:53:18.302 --> 00:53:20.762
Yeah, well, we're all sorry, aren't we?

706
00:53:20.846 --> 00:53:23.390
There's no reason
for you to bring her here.

707
00:53:23.474 --> 00:53:27.227
The fact that you gave that coin to him

708
00:53:27.311 --> 00:53:29.938
tells me there are many reasons,

709
00:53:30.022 --> 00:53:32.232
but only one I care about.

710
00:53:32.316 --> 00:53:34.276
Why would we try to betray you?

711
00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:40.240
Well, Ripley, in your case, perhaps,
a misguided sense of revenge.

712
00:53:40.324 --> 00:53:43.410
His, perhaps, simply greed.

713
00:53:43.494 --> 00:53:45.996
It doesn't matter.

714
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.832
I will not take the chance
of the two of you

715
00:53:48.916 --> 00:53:53.086
taking what is rightfully mine
and selling it to the highest bidder.

716
00:53:54.797 --> 00:53:58.633
Please, excuse me, Mr. Petrovich.

717
00:53:58.718 --> 00:54:00.885
Will you, please? Thank you.

718
00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:05.557
Where is it written
that these eggs are yours?

719
00:54:08.769 --> 00:54:11.855
Because they belong to my family.

720
00:54:11.939 --> 00:54:17.068
Because my great-grandfather
made them.

721
00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:19.279
Yes, Ripley.

722
00:54:19.363 --> 00:54:21.031
Evgenly Petrovich made them.

723
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:30.248
He made the 1917 mystery eggs.

724
00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:33.293
I will have those eggs.

725
00:54:33.377 --> 00:54:36.755
And you will get them for me.

726
00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:41.843
That's why I bring Alexandra here.

727
00:54:41.927 --> 00:54:45.347
To keep me company while you do
what you need to do.

728
00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:48.725
Go.

729
00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:59.110
Anyone try to follow us, she dies.

730
00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:01.279
If there are police, she dies.

731
00:55:02.782 --> 00:55:07.494
If I don't get what I want...she dies.

732
00:55:09.997 --> 00:55:11.289
Go.

733
00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:13.458
There is a subway, not far.

734
00:55:17.797 --> 00:55:20.507
Damn you, Gabriel.

735
00:55:20.591 --> 00:55:22.425
I told you not to get her involved.

736
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.511
You told me? You told me?

737
00:55:24.595 --> 00:55:27.764
You and her father got her involved
even before she was born.

738
00:55:27.848 --> 00:55:29.182
God damn it!

739
00:55:29.266 --> 00:55:30.725
We go tomorrow.

740
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:52.151
I heard a noise.

741
00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:54.237
What noise?

742
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:57.323
- You don't hear it?
- No.

743
00:56:57.705 --> 00:56:59.912
Permission to investigate? Over.

744
00:57:00.166 --> 00:57:01.247
Wait.

745
00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:02.544
Gregor.

746
00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.087
Negative for the noise.

747
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:09.169
Log book says
MTA's doing subway maintenance.

748
00:57:09.843 --> 00:57:11.129
Maintenance?

749
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:14.966
Yes, in subway.
Keep us posted. Out.

750
00:57:15.014 --> 00:57:16.550
Vault Level. Cut.

751
00:57:44.235 --> 00:57:46.819
How much time?

752
00:57:46.904 --> 00:57:49.197
Just over 3 minutes
until the 2200 hour check.

753
00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:32.789
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

754
00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:36.084
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

755
00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:06.665
Zone 47. Basement stairwell door

756
00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.211
That can't be the MTA.

757
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:13.121
I'm sending Gregor to check it out.

758
00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.802
Vault Level, come in.

759
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:18.972
Vault Level.

760
00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:21.756
Check out the alarm in the basement.

761
00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.848
On my Way-

762
00:59:44.706 --> 00:59:46.447
False alarm All clear.

763
01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:08.305
Tell them everything's okay.

764
01:00:14.134 --> 01:00:16.135
Smart card.

765
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.929
Come on, come on!

766
01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:22.600
Let's go.

767
01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:34.756
He's taking his time.

768
01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.385
This is becoming quite boring.

769
01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:47.644
What is that?

770
01:00:48.127 --> 01:00:50.044
Porno?

771
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:51.648
Happy birthday, Artur.

772
01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.223
Gregor, it's not my birthday.

773
01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:56.069
It's not?

774
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:05.033
Someone has delivered
this birthday cake for Artur.

775
01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.660
It's not my birthday.

776
01:01:06.704 --> 01:01:09.913
My mistake. I thought it was the 23rd.

777
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.746
I left my walkie in the basement.
Permission to retrieve?

778
01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:16.665
Make it fast, Gregor.
This is not amusing.

779
01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:00.630
This is good cake.

780
01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:04.167
You should have
a birthday more often.

781
01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:50.122
Rasputin.

782
01:02:53.252 --> 01:02:55.294
Rasputin.

783
01:02:55.379 --> 01:02:56.963
17.

784
01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:00.424
17.

785
01:03:00.509 --> 01:03:02.468
Norway.

786
01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:05.221
Norway.

787
01:03:12.104 --> 01:03:14.021
Fuck.

788
01:03:14.106 --> 01:03:16.023
It wants to know if I'm hungry.

789
01:03:16.108 --> 01:03:17.358
Are you?

790
01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:27.410
Nyet.

791
01:04:17.419 --> 01:04:18.419
All right.

792
01:04:18.503 --> 01:04:20.630
Wait, wait, wait.

793
01:04:28.305 --> 01:04:29.722
Go.

794
01:04:36.021 --> 01:04:37.355
Stop.

795
01:04:37.439 --> 01:04:38.940
Go right.

796
01:04:41.985 --> 01:04:45.529
Right.

797
01:04:45.614 --> 01:04:47.365
Stop.

798
01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:48.532
Good.

799
01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:55.206
Straight ahead.

800
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:58.459
Go, go, go, go, go.

801
01:04:58.543 --> 01:04:59.961
Stop. Flatten out.

802
01:05:00.045 --> 01:05:01.837
Head down, head down, head down.

803
01:05:03.382 --> 01:05:07.802
Okay. Now diagonally left.

804
01:05:07.886 --> 01:05:09.303
Diagonally to the left.

805
01:05:14.601 --> 01:05:15.601
Keep going.

806
01:05:15.686 --> 01:05:17.269
Left.

807
01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:19.814
Get your arm in. No, arms!

808
01:05:19.898 --> 01:05:22.316
- Flat. Down.
- Oh, shit.

809
01:05:22.401 --> 01:05:24.986
Okay. Straight ahead.

810
01:05:30.158 --> 01:05:32.159
Go, go, go, go, go.

811
01:05:32.244 --> 01:05:33.995
Go, go.

812
01:05:38.709 --> 01:05:39.875
Stop. Stop.

813
01:05:41.503 --> 01:05:43.087
Deploy.

814
01:05:51.763 --> 01:05:53.431
Hurry.

815
01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:07.987
Stop. Stop. Flat.

816
01:06:08.071 --> 01:06:09.071
Flat!

817
01:06:11.742 --> 01:06:13.034
Okay, hurry.

818
01:06:21.835 --> 01:06:23.711
Quick as you can.

819
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:28.549
Good.

820
01:06:36.099 --> 01:06:37.850
It's working. Let's go.

821
01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:05.002
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

822
01:07:07.756 --> 01:07:09.924
- Lead.
- Okay.

823
01:07:10.008 --> 01:07:11.300
Let's take a look.

824
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:29.693
When? Shit!

825
01:07:29.778 --> 01:07:30.778
All right, sit tight.

826
01:07:30.862 --> 01:07:32.071
We're on our way.

827
01:07:32.155 --> 01:07:34.573
Yes, I owe you.

828
01:07:34.658 --> 01:07:37.118
They're having a sale at Romanov.

829
01:07:37.202 --> 01:07:39.411
- Sir?
- That was my plant.

830
01:07:39.496 --> 01:07:41.872
Unexplained alarm went off
about an hour ago.

831
01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:44.041
I want all available units
in the garage now.

832
01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.627
Vouti and Michaels,
have them meet us at the staging area.

833
01:07:46.711 --> 01:07:49.004
- Yes, sir.
- Now it's my turn.

834
01:07:59.224 --> 01:08:01.350
We're good.

835
01:08:05.438 --> 01:08:07.022
All right.

836
01:08:12.028 --> 01:08:14.697
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

837
01:08:14.781 --> 01:08:16.448
- You're on.
- All right.

838
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.160
- Okay, a little more.
- Ready?

839
01:08:19.244 --> 01:08:21.120
Come on, a little more.
A little more, little more.

01:08:21.204 --> 01:08:23.247
Come on. More, more, more.

01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:25.666
More, more, more.
Stop! Okay.

842
01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.251
Right there.

843
01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:32.131
- All right.
- Good job.

844
01:08:32.215 --> 01:08:34.508

Bingo.

858
01:09:12.464 --> 01:09:13.923
Go, Sergeant! Let's go!

859
01:09:14.007 --> 01:09:15.341
- Yes, sir.
- Sometime tonight.

860
01:09:15.425 --> 01:09:16.842
How about it?

861
01:09:16.927 --> 01:09:18.761
- All right.
- All right.

862
01:09:18.845 --> 01:09:22.348
4, 5, 6, 1, 2.

01:09:23.475 --> 01:09:25.726
Got it. Got it.

No.

872
01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:49.124
Damn it.

873
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:54.421
4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 6.

874
01:09:55.548 --> 01:09:58.259

Come on.

879
01:10:19.197 --> 01:10:21.365
What the fuck are you doing?

880
01:10:21.449 --> 01:10:23.575
lmprovising.

881
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:39.925
Shit.

882
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.469
- Take this shit off.
- Careful.

883
01:10:42.554 --> 01:10:44.763
Let's go. Come on.
Move around this guy.

884
01:10:44.848 --> 01:10:46.098
Move those guys out of the way.

885
01:10:46.182 --> 01:10:48.142
Come on! Go through the lights!

886
01:11:46.576 --> 01:11:48.369
There.

887
01:11:50.914 --> 01:11:53.665
See if you can move these boxes.

888
01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.379
All right.

889
01:12:24.989 --> 01:12:26.240
Okay.

890
01:12:50.515 --> 01:12:51.932
What are you doing?

891
01:12:52.016 --> 01:12:53.016
Give me the box.

892
01:12:54.477 --> 01:12:56.603
- Gabriel, don't do this.
- Give me the box.

893
01:12:58.148 --> 01:12:59.273
What, you want more money?

894
01:12:59.357 --> 01:13:00.524
Hell, man, look around you.

895
01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:03.986
- Take what you want.
- Oh, shut up and give me the box.

896
01:13:05.155 --> 01:13:06.196
What about Alex?

897
01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.990
Nicky will kill her. You know that.

898
01:13:08.074 --> 01:13:10.826
I will ask you one more time.

899
01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:14.913
Why are you doing this?

900
01:13:14.998 --> 01:13:16.331
I'm a cop.

901
01:13:18.668 --> 01:13:20.419
In Miami for the last 10 years.

902
01:13:20.503 --> 01:13:23.255
Weber requested me, just for you.

903
01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:29.136
So you're a cop.

904
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.929
You want to arrest me? Go ahead.

905
01:13:31.014 --> 01:13:32.431
Where am I gonna go?

906
01:13:32.515 --> 01:13:34.600
But in one minute,
that vault door's gonna lock,

907
01:13:34.684 --> 01:13:38.353
and we'll be stuck in here,
and Alex is gonna be dead.

908
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.273
I can't believe you're such
a contemptible human being

909
01:13:41.357 --> 01:13:43.942
that you would use her like that
and then just kill her

910
01:13:44.027 --> 01:13:46.487
because you might as well
be pulling the trigger yourself.

911
01:13:46.571 --> 01:13:50.407
Simply to bag the great Keith Ripley.

912
01:13:50.575 --> 01:13:54.328
You sorry, sick motherfucker.

913
01:13:57.248 --> 01:13:58.373
You got 30 seconds.

914
01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.666
How do I find Nicky?

915
01:14:01.127 --> 01:14:03.879
- Phone number in my pocket.
- Give it to me.

916
01:14:03.963 --> 01:14:06.507
And the eggs.

917
01:14:06.591 --> 01:14:08.884
Do you want her alive or not?

918
01:14:08.968 --> 01:14:10.677
Do you?

919
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:25.150
10 seconds.

920
01:14:26.569 --> 01:14:27.861
I'm sorry.

921
01:14:33.785 --> 01:14:35.160
Come on.

922
01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:58.684
Underground, boys.

923
01:14:58.768 --> 01:15:00.686
All right, let's move! Come on!

924
01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:12.580
Security Desk to Vault Level. Over.

925
01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:18.089
Security Desk to Vault Level. Over.

926
01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:22.764
Bodgan, check out the elevator.
Immediately.

927
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:50.402
I'm a police officer!

928
01:15:50.486 --> 01:15:51.862
Listen to me.

929
01:15:51.946 --> 01:15:53.947
There is a thief
locked in your inner vault.

930
01:15:54.032 --> 01:15:56.366
The guard is in the basement closet.

931
01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.452
Move! Move, move, move!

932
01:15:58.536 --> 01:15:59.995
Move out of there!

933
01:16:00.079 --> 01:16:01.830
Now! Move!

934
01:16:01.914 --> 01:16:03.165
Come on!

935
01:16:03.249 --> 01:16:05.417
Tell them to put their weapons down now.

936
01:16:06.836 --> 01:16:08.503
Now!

937
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:09.755
- Aah!
- Okay.

938
01:16:09.839 --> 01:16:11.214
Fine.

939
01:16:14.177 --> 01:16:15.552
Put them down.

940
01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.012
Now!

941
01:16:22.226 --> 01:16:24.227
Kick them, now!

942
01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:27.981
What do you want?

943
01:16:29.233 --> 01:16:32.569
You let me out the front door
so I can rejoin my unit.

944
01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:34.613
They have the building surrounded.

945
01:16:34.697 --> 01:16:38.325
Meantime, you go downstairs,
you find your thief and your comrade.

946
01:16:38.409 --> 01:16:39.951
- You understand?
- That door is alarmed.

947
01:16:40.036 --> 01:16:42.621
- I can't just open it.
- You have a problem, solve it.

948
01:16:42.705 --> 01:16:45.082
Do not make me shoot this man, please.

949
01:16:55.093 --> 01:16:56.593
Aah!

950
01:17:24.372 --> 01:17:25.997
Put down your weapons.

951
01:17:26.082 --> 01:17:27.332
- We are police!
- Yeah?

952
01:17:27.417 --> 01:17:30.168
Everybody's police tonight.

953
01:17:36.926 --> 01:17:39.886
- Hello?
- Hey, I have what you want.

954
01:17:39.971 --> 01:17:41.096
No, it's just me.

955
01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.484
We have these 'police'
in the conference room.

956
01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.202
Keep them there for now.

957
01:18:02.618 --> 01:18:04.035
Can we talk?

958
01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.830
I have a proposition for you.

959
01:18:18.217 --> 01:18:19.801
Where is she?

960
01:18:23.347 --> 01:18:25.932
Do not move.

961
01:18:26.017 --> 01:18:28.602
He has a gun behind the box.

962
01:18:28.686 --> 01:18:29.770
Bad boy.

963
01:18:29.854 --> 01:18:33.106
Give me the box and give Andrei
your weapon, please.

964
01:18:33.191 --> 01:18:34.900
- We don't wish trouble here.
- No, no, no, no.

965
01:18:34.984 --> 01:18:36.359
You don't understand.

966
01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:40.030
You let her go, then I'll give you the box.

967
01:18:40.114 --> 01:18:42.949
You see, if I fire through this box,

968
01:18:43.034 --> 01:18:45.494
which I have no problem doing
whatsoever,

969
01:18:45.578 --> 01:18:47.162
Nicky's not gonna be very happy.

970
01:18:47.246 --> 01:18:49.748
Then we are all expendable.

971
01:18:49.832 --> 01:18:52.626
If you actually understand
the meaning of the word.

972
01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:54.252
Open the box.

973
01:18:55.546 --> 01:18:57.881
Lower the gun. Lower the gun.

974
01:18:57.965 --> 01:18:59.883
Lower it.

975
01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.097
Okay.

976
01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:15.273
You all right?

977
01:19:15.358 --> 01:19:17.484
Yeah. I'm just lovely, thanks.

978
01:19:17.568 --> 01:19:19.820
You go.

979
01:19:27.745 --> 01:19:29.079
Give me the box.

980
01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:34.543
- Get in.
- Why?

981
01:19:34.627 --> 01:19:36.336
Nicky wants to see you.

982
01:19:38.422 --> 01:19:39.923
Give me your weapon.

983
01:19:41.425 --> 01:19:42.968
We're fine, right?

984
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:55.230
Where do you get off detaining us?

985
01:19:55.314 --> 01:19:56.898
My apologies, Lieutenant Weber.

986
01:19:56.983 --> 01:19:59.818
My security were,
understandably, confused.

987
01:19:59.902 --> 01:20:02.696
Please go with Mr. Sergeev
down to the vault.

988
01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.906
We have what you want. Please.

989
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.459
Where's the other one?

990
01:20:16.544 --> 01:20:17.544
Nobody else.

991
01:20:17.628 --> 01:20:18.920
Just him.

992
01:20:19.005 --> 01:20:20.714
Where the hell's my man?

993
01:20:21.799 --> 01:20:27.262
Lieutenant, your personal life--
none of my business.

994
01:20:28.598 --> 01:20:32.559
I apologize for bringing you here,

995
01:20:32.643 --> 01:20:35.353
but I had to be sure the eggs were genuine

996
01:20:35.438 --> 01:20:37.105
before I let you go.

997
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:42.027
Your lack of trust is really depressing,
Mr. Petrovich.

998
01:20:43.362 --> 01:20:45.614
I'm a man of my word.

999
01:20:47.366 --> 01:20:50.118
She should be with her godfather now.

1000
01:20:52.663 --> 01:20:54.289
Let's see.

1001
01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:57.584
- Do you mind?
- Sure, call.

1002
01:21:05.593 --> 01:21:06.593
Yeah.

1003
01:21:11.807 --> 01:21:14.392
- Hello?
- Hey. Where are you?

1004
01:21:15.603 --> 01:21:16.937
I'm at the jail.

1005
01:21:17.021 --> 01:21:20.148
- I had to see him.
- How is he?

1006
01:21:20.232 --> 01:21:21.524
Well, how do you think he is?

1007
01:21:21.609 --> 01:21:23.944
I had no choice, Alex.

1008
01:21:24.028 --> 01:21:25.612
No one had a choice.

1009
01:21:25.696 --> 01:21:27.447
Remember?

1010
01:21:27.531 --> 01:21:28.531
I told you.

1011
01:21:28.616 --> 01:21:30.951
Neither one of us could promise a thing.

1012
01:21:31.035 --> 01:21:34.287
Listen, promises blow away
in the wind,

1013
01:21:34.372 --> 01:21:36.247
but feelings are real.

1014
01:21:36.332 --> 01:21:38.291
And I need to know

1015
01:21:38.376 --> 01:21:40.418
were the feelings lies, too?

1016
01:21:40.503 --> 01:21:41.920
Listen, listen.

1017
01:21:42.004 --> 01:21:43.088
What I mean is...

1018
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.632
are we real?

1019
01:21:47.385 --> 01:21:48.551
Um...

1020
01:21:51.472 --> 01:21:54.182
I've got to go, Gabriel.

1021
01:21:54.266 --> 01:21:55.266
Good night.

1022
01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:56.476
Hey, don't--

1023
01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.103
Hold--

1024
01:22:06.362 --> 01:22:08.405
Are you satisfied?

1025
01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:19.624
Did you see them?

1026
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:22.252
Actually, we were in a hurry.

1027
01:22:22.336 --> 01:22:23.920
Look.

1028
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.890
They are simply...

1029
01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:37.475
wood?

1030
01:22:55.494 --> 01:22:57.495
Oh, my God.

1031
01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.289
Simply wood?

1032
01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:05.545
It was 1917, Gabriel.

1033
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:06.713
Russia.

1034
01:23:06.797 --> 01:23:08.214
People were starving.

1035
01:23:08.299 --> 01:23:12.343
There were no jewels, no diamonds left.

1036
01:23:12.428 --> 01:23:14.721
No hope.

1037
01:23:14.805 --> 01:23:18.516
Yet Czarina Alexandra
had to have her eggs.

1038
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:24.731
Perhaps you understand
why we had that revolution.

1039
01:23:24.815 --> 01:23:28.485
People needed to believe in something.

1040
01:23:30.738 --> 01:23:32.697
Take him home.

1041
01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:39.913
Gabriel.

1042
01:23:43.793 --> 01:23:48.546
I know what they say about me,
but I'm not a killer.

1043
01:23:48.631 --> 01:23:52.008
Merely a humble immigrant.

1044
01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.968
Probably much like you.

1045
01:23:55.554 --> 01:23:57.722
I don't think so, Mr. Petrovich.

1046
01:23:59.433 --> 01:24:02.143
You're not like me at all.

1047
01:24:12.863 --> 01:24:14.114
Excellent.

1048
01:24:14.198 --> 01:24:16.074
Thanks.

1049
01:24:16.158 --> 01:24:18.618
We got Petrovich. Snitch called it in.

1050
01:24:18.702 --> 01:24:21.246
After all this time looking for him,
you know where he was?

1051
01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:23.081
I'm sure you'll tell us.

1052
01:24:23.165 --> 01:24:25.083
He was sitting on the boardwalk,
watching the sun come up.

1053
01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:26.793
He's coming in now.

1054
01:24:26.877 --> 01:24:28.711
I'll be right back.

1055
01:24:30.923 --> 01:24:32.340
Yeah.

1056
01:24:32.424 --> 01:24:35.552
What I didn't count on was that
a so-called professional

1057
01:24:35.636 --> 01:24:37.679
would be manipulated by a chick.

1058
01:24:37.763 --> 01:24:39.472
What kind of cops they make
down there in Miami?

1059
01:24:39.557 --> 01:24:41.683
Good ones, Weber. Good ones.

1060
01:24:41.767 --> 01:24:43.518
I don't get it.

1061
01:24:43.602 --> 01:24:45.353
All these years in that world.

1062
01:24:45.437 --> 01:24:47.188
How do you let an asset use you?

1063
01:24:48.566 --> 01:24:51.067
Sometimes things, uh, change.

1064
01:24:51.235 --> 01:24:52.318
"Things change"?

1065
01:24:52.403 --> 01:24:55.613
Like a "which side am I on" change?

1066
01:24:55.698 --> 01:24:58.116
Ripley, what is he, your best friend now?

1067
01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.326
Well, actually, a better friend than you.

1068
01:25:00.411 --> 01:25:02.453
Ah, I get it.

1069
01:25:02.538 --> 01:25:03.746
I'm the asshole.

1070
01:25:03.831 --> 01:25:05.456
You're gonna tell me what a good guy he is

1071
01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:08.376
or how he got caught up
in a situation he couldn't control

1072
01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.004
or how the sins of the father
shouldn't rest on the daughter?

1073
01:25:11.088 --> 01:25:14.048
Give me something better
than "things change."

1074
01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:17.468
All I can give you is the truth.

1075
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.847
Eh, fuck it.

1076
01:25:20.931 --> 01:25:23.057
Go back to Miami, Martin.

1077
01:25:25.477 --> 01:25:29.480
When your superiors get my report,
you'll be lucky if you have a job.

1078
01:25:29.565 --> 01:25:30.857
We'll see.

1079
01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:33.026
Hey, say anything you want about Ripley,

1080
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:36.154
but nothing changes the fact
that I finally got him.

1081
01:25:36.238 --> 01:25:40.116
Now when he leaves prison,
he'll be leaving in a pine box.

1082
01:25:41.577 --> 01:25:43.077
Let's go see Mr. Petrovich.

1083
01:25:56.717 --> 01:25:58.343
No.

1084
01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:07.060
That's not Nicky Petrovich.

1085
01:26:07.144 --> 01:26:08.686
What?

1086
01:26:08.771 --> 01:26:10.355
Not him.

1087
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.027
Look, man, Organized Crime confirmed it.

1088
01:26:16.111 --> 01:26:18.988
- That's Nicky Petrovich.
- Well, I don't care.

1089
01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.073
That's not him.

1090
01:26:20.157 --> 01:26:22.325
I was there, remember?

1091
01:26:22.409 --> 01:26:25.119
There's no case here.

1092
01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:27.497
What are you talking about?
Of course there's a case.

1093
01:26:27.581 --> 01:26:29.749
Do you really think I'm going
to put him on the stand?

1094
01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:32.627
An undercover Miami cop
who may or may not be legit?

1095
01:26:32.711 --> 01:26:33.795
- No offense.
- None taken.

1096
01:26:33.879 --> 01:26:36.881
A cop who's the centerpiece
of a botched undercover operation

1097
01:26:36.966 --> 01:26:39.133
that was officially ordered stopped?

1098
01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.011
I'm not going to embarrass the Bureau,
much less your department,

1099
01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:45.306
which accepted tons of money
and equipment from the Russian Mafia.

1100
01:26:45.391 --> 01:26:46.724
What about Romanov's?

1101
01:26:46.809 --> 01:26:49.310
What about the goddamn
stolen treasures of Russia?

1102
01:26:49.395 --> 01:26:50.395
What about it, Weber?

1103
01:26:50.479 --> 01:26:52.146
When Zykov found Ripley in the vault,

1104
01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:54.607
he had everything cleared out
before you could get in.

1105
01:26:54.692 --> 01:26:57.277
I have a proposition for you.

1106
01:26:57.361 --> 01:27:00.697
There's no way Romanov's
will press charges against Ripley.

1107
01:27:00.781 --> 01:27:02.365
Because they can never admit that the eggs

1108
01:27:02.449 --> 01:27:05.285
or anything else ever existed.

1109
01:27:05.369 --> 01:27:07.287
So we can't even prove
that Detective Martin and Ripley

1110
01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:09.580
stole even a goddamn dime.

1111
01:27:09.665 --> 01:27:11.791
But you must have mug shots.

1112
01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:14.502
Russian Mafia,
known associates, something.

1113
01:27:38.736 --> 01:27:41.279
That's him.

1114
01:27:41.363 --> 01:27:43.072
That's Nicky Petrovich.

1115
01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:46.576
- Detective Martin?
- Yeah?

1116
01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.786
That's Victor Korolenko.

1117
01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.215
Presumed dead.

1118
01:28:02.426 --> 01:28:05.345
We just never found the body.

1119
01:28:09.099 --> 01:28:13.227
We never will...Lieutenant.

1120
01:28:58.899 --> 01:29:00.691
Weber.

1121
01:29:00.776 --> 01:29:01.901
What?

1122
01:29:01.985 --> 01:29:03.820
His lawyer got him in front of a judge

1123
01:29:03.904 --> 01:29:05.321
on an expedited bail hearing.

1124
01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.864
Then he just walked.

1125
01:29:06.949 --> 01:29:08.491
Who was it?

1126
01:29:08.575 --> 01:29:10.868
- Who was what?
- The lawyer.

1127
01:29:10.953 --> 01:29:13.204
Who the fuck do you think?

1128
01:29:13.288 --> 01:29:14.497
Alex.

1129
01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:16.249
Korolenko.

1130
01:29:38.605 --> 01:29:44.527
You can't promise me a thing,
so maybe we shouldn't even try.

1131
01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:29.030
Papa.

1132
01:30:29.114 --> 01:30:31.157
Shall we go?

1133
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:43.669
Yeah?

1134
01:30:43.754 --> 01:30:46.714
Didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

1135
01:30:46.798 --> 01:30:49.342
I owe you one, Gaby.

1136
01:30:49.426 --> 01:30:50.760
The real Nicky Petrovich

1137
01:30:50.844 --> 01:30:53.763
is the one Zykov is funneling
the contraband through.

1138
01:30:53.847 --> 01:30:58.059
Thank you, but Zykov and Petrovich

1139
01:30:58.143 --> 01:30:59.310
have gone underground.

1140
01:30:59.394 --> 01:31:00.520
Check out a disco called--

1141
01:31:00.604 --> 01:31:02.021
Riga Rose?

1142
01:31:02.105 --> 01:31:04.774
Ah, I see you're familiar
with the territory.

1143
01:31:04.858 --> 01:31:07.944
Well...I am a cop, remember?

1144
01:31:08.028 --> 01:31:09.820
Never forgot it for a second.

1145
01:31:09.905 --> 01:31:11.489
When did you know?

1146
01:31:11.573 --> 01:31:15.409
I knew you were coming up from Miami
before you did, Gaby.

1147
01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:16.911
See, Weber and I--

1148
01:31:16.995 --> 01:31:19.664
Well, let's just say
we share the same sources,

1149
01:31:19.748 --> 01:31:21.207
only I pay better.

1150
01:31:21.291 --> 01:31:22.917
Sir, we're good to go.

1151
01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:25.378
So why the help, Ripley?

1152
01:31:25.462 --> 01:31:27.463
Maybe feeling guilty?

1153
01:31:29.007 --> 01:31:31.884
"Guilt" is not even in my vocabulary.

1154
01:31:31.969 --> 01:31:35.388
I was just hoping
you'd see things differently.

1155
01:31:35.472 --> 01:31:38.558
Together, you and I could do andhing.

1156
01:31:40.102 --> 01:31:41.477
Yeah.

1157
01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:43.271
I believe we did.

1158
01:31:43.355 --> 01:31:46.440
I'll get in touch later on,
if you're interested.

1159
01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:49.235
Meanwhile, I've got to keep
an appointment with a man

1160
01:31:49.319 --> 01:31:50.778
who's gonna pay very dearly
for something

1161
01:31:50.862 --> 01:31:53.030
he's got to keep locked in his basement

1162
01:31:53.115 --> 01:31:54.740
just to say it's his.

1163
01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:58.369
- Good hunting, Gaby.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1164
01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.539
Let me talk to her, just for a second.

1165
01:32:01.623 --> 01:32:02.832
That's him?

1166
01:32:02.916 --> 01:32:04.584
What makes you think
she's going anywhere?

1167
01:32:04.668 --> 01:32:06.168
She didn't commit any crime.

1168
01:32:06.253 --> 01:32:09.338
She just lied to someone
who was lying to her.

1169
01:32:20.642 --> 01:32:22.602
You be good.

1170
01:32:22.686 --> 01:32:25.813
I'll try, Uncle Keith.

1171
01:32:25.897 --> 01:32:30.192
Although I suspect
my legal career just ended.

1172
01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:32.528
Thank God.

1173
01:33:02.809 --> 01:33:04.935
You come in here every night,

1174
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:10.149
and every night I tell you
I don't know shit from this Petrovich.

1175
01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.944
This is a nightclub, my friend.

1176
01:33:14.029 --> 01:33:16.614
You know what I think?

1177
01:33:16.698 --> 01:33:19.033
I think you need to check out the action

1178
01:33:19.117 --> 01:33:20.660
and get your ass laid.

1179
01:33:20.744 --> 01:33:21.744
Yeah.

1180
01:33:21.828 --> 01:33:23.996
- You know what I'm saying to you?
- Yeah.

1181
01:33:24.081 --> 01:33:26.248
Find yourself a chick.

1182
01:33:37.552 --> 01:33:41.847
Vodka.

1183
01:33:41.932 --> 01:33:43.349
Zakuska?

1184
01:33:43.433 --> 01:33:45.476
Russian hors d'oeuvres
to coat the stomach.

1185
01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.769
Oh.

1186
01:33:47.938 --> 01:33:49.438
Will my stomach need coating?

1187
01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.732
I hope so.

1188
01:33:51.817 --> 01:33:54.151
I thought you didn't drink.

1189
01:33:54.236 --> 01:33:55.861
You thought a lot of things,

1190
01:33:55.946 --> 01:33:59.907
but I believe I mentioned something
about making assumptions.

1191
01:33:59.991 --> 01:34:02.118
Maybe that's a concept
we should get rid of.

1192
01:34:02.202 --> 01:34:03.327
lmmediately.

1193
01:34:03.412 --> 01:34:06.414
My name is Gabriel Martin.

1194
01:34:06.498 --> 01:34:08.791
I am from Miami.

1195
01:34:08.875 --> 01:34:13.796
I was actually looking for a lawyer,
but the office was closed.

1196
01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:17.633
So...I came here.

1197
01:34:21.596 --> 01:34:23.431
Okay.

1198
01:34:23.515 --> 01:34:27.768
My name is Alexandra Korolenko,

1199
01:34:27.853 --> 01:34:31.188
and I come from St. Petersburg

1200
01:34:31.273 --> 01:34:33.232
by way of Little Odessa.

1201
01:34:34.526 --> 01:34:36.777
And...

1202
01:34:36.862 --> 01:34:38.946
I love to dance.

1203
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:40.740
So...

1204
01:34:40.824 --> 01:34:43.200
I came here tonight.

1205
01:34:48.957 --> 01:34:51.167
Do you want to dance with me?

1206
01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:54.754
Yeah.

1207
01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:59.842
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.

1208
01:35:02.971 --> 01:35:04.472
Me, too.

1209
01:35:06.892 --> 01:35:08.642
- Alex?
- Yeah?

1210
01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:12.521
That night, when I called you
from Coney lsland,

1211
01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:15.024
you never answered my question.

1212
01:35:15.108 --> 01:35:16.692
Which one?

1213
01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:20.321
I wanted to-- I want to know...

1214
01:35:24.117 --> 01:35:25.659
Was it all lies?

1215
01:35:34.419 --> 01:35:36.170
Not the part that matters.

1216
01:35:36.254 --> 01:35:40.299
<i>♫  Starting right here,
let's make a promise</i>

1217
01:35:40.383 --> 01:35:41.842
<i>♫   You and me</i>

1218
01:35:41.927 --> 01:35:43.594

01:35:43.678 --> 01:35:45.679

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.181
<i>♫   Nothing can stop us</i>

1221
01:35:47.265 --> 01:35:48.682
That was true.

1222
01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:52.102
That was real. I felt that.

1223
01:35:52.187 --> 01:35:54.897
That was real.
That was real. Finally.

1224
01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.112
<i>♫   We'll run away
on roads that are empty</i>

1225
