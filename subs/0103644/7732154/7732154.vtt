Hell of a way to make a landing!

19
00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:56.195
Use the torch.

20
00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:09.709
- How many?
- Don't know.

21
00:05:09.793 --> 00:05:11.460
Three. Maybe four.

22
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:15.882
Hey, Frank. Can we hurry this up?
It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes.

Hey, Frank, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

29
00:05:40.824 --> 00:05:42.742
Wait!

30
00:05:44.536 --> 00:05:46.454

We're gonna need all of those.

<i>(Beeping)</i>

36
00:06:13.357 --> 00:06:17.860

<i>(Barking continues)</i>

40
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.149
This is rumor control.
Here are the facts.

41
00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.736
As some of you know,

42
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.197
a 337 model E.E.V....

43
00:07:45.282 --> 00:07:48.451
crash-landed here at 0600...

44
00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:51.162
on the morning watch.

45
00:07:51.246 --> 00:07:53.789
There was one survivor,

46
00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:58.252
two dead and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair.

47
00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:00.921
The survivor is a woman.

48
00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:03.340
<i>(Chattering, laughing)</i>

49
00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:04.592
<i>(Man) That's what I saw.</i>

50
00:08:04.676 --> 00:08:07.219
I just want to say that I've
taken a vow of celibacy.

51
00:08:07.345 --> 00:08:09.597
- <i>(Man #2) So have we all.</i>
- That also includes women.

52
00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:11.766
- <i>(Man #2) Yes.</i>
- We've all taken the vow!

53
00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:14.560
- <i>(Man #3) Shut your gob, Morse.
- (Morse) I'd like to say that I, for one,</i>

54
00:08:14.644 --> 00:08:17.146
<i>do not appreciate company policy
allowing her to freely...</i>

55
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.356
intermingle with inmates
and the rest of the staff.

56
00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:24.111
What brother means to say is we view
the presence of any outsider,

57
00:08:24.196 --> 00:08:28.824
especially a woman...
as a violation of the harmony,

58
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.826
a potential break in
the spiritual unity.

59
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:33.496
We are well aware of your feelings
in this matter.

60
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.250
You wilI be pleased to know that
I have requested a rescue team.

61
00:08:38.335 --> 00:08:40.920
<i>Hopefully, they will be here
inside of a week...</i>

62
00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:45.091
- <i>(Man) Oh, come on!</i>
- and evacuate her A.S.A.P.

63
00:08:45.175 --> 00:08:47.093
<i>(Man) Don't give us that!</i>

64
00:08:47.177 --> 00:08:49.053
What's her medical status?

65
00:08:49.137 --> 00:08:51.055
She doesn't seem too badly damaged.

66
00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:54.975
She's unconscious. Can't give you a
more specific diagnosis at the moment.

67
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.436
- Will she live?
- I would think so.

68
00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.190
Look. It's in everybody's interest

69
00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:04.985
the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary
until the rescue team arrives.

70
00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:09.240
- And certainly not without an escort, right?
- Sir.

71
00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:14.829
Gentlemen, we should all stick
to our set routine...

72
00:09:14.913 --> 00:09:17.081
and not get unduly agitated.

73
00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:18.666
- <i>(Man) Right.</i>
- Correct?

74
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.628
All right. Thank you, gentlemen.

75
00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:26.173
<i>(Sighs)</i>

76
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:29.927
All right.

77
00:09:30.053 --> 00:09:32.721
<i>(Man) Better get here soon
or there ain't gonna be much left.</i>

78
00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:03.169
<i>(Clattering)</i>

79
00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:11.594
<i>(Inhales sharply)</i> What's that?

80
00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:16.891
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix.
Sort of eye-opener.

81
00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:19.393
<i>(Breathing heavily)</i>
You a doctor?

82
00:10:19.477 --> 00:10:23.022
My name is Clemens.
I'm the Chief Medical Officer here.

83
00:10:23.106 --> 00:10:26.150
- Here?
- Fury 161.

84
00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:29.612
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's
backwater work prisons,

85
00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.614
it grieves me to say.

86
00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:33.616
Do you mind?

87
00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:39.330
This is basically a stabilizer.

88
00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:42.333
I really ought to shave your head.

89
00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.919
We have a big problem
with lice here.

90
00:10:45.003 --> 00:10:47.504
And when you're feeling better,
I'll give you some clippers,

91
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:51.634
- and you can tend to your private parts yourself.
- How'd I get here?

92
00:10:53.178 --> 00:10:56.764
You crash-landed in an E.E.V.

93
00:10:56.848 --> 00:11:00.309
Evidently separated from your mother ship
before you hit our atmosphere.

94
00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:03.771
You have any idea how long
you were in hypersleep?

95
00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:06.482
'Cause coming out the way you did
can be quite a jolt to the system.

96
00:11:06.608 --> 00:11:09.068
- Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks.
- Indeed.

97
00:11:09.152 --> 00:11:12.905
<i>(Sighs)</i>

98
00:11:12.989 --> 00:11:15.908
- Where are the others?
- They didn't make it.

99
00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:19.078
- What?
- They didn't survive.

100
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:25.167
I have to get to the ship.

101
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:28.337
- Have to get to the ship.
- You're in no condition for that.

102
00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:32.299
You want to get me some clothes,
or should I just go like this?

103
00:11:32.384 --> 00:11:37.221
Given the nature of our indigenous population,
I would suggest clothes.

104
00:11:38.974 --> 00:11:42.184
- <i>(Clears throat)</i>
- None of them have seen a woman in years.

105
00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:47.106
Neither have I, for that matter.

106
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:52.861
This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,

107
00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:56.448
but it's been reduced to
a custodial staff of 25.

108
00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:57.533
Why?

109
00:11:57.617 --> 00:11:59.618
- Keep the pilot light on.
- The pilot light for what?

110
00:12:01.914 --> 00:12:05.291
- <i>(Shouting)</i>
- Blast furnace. Natural methane.

111
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:09.003
We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley.

112
00:12:09.087 --> 00:12:12.465
The inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containers.

113
00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:15.301
How do you know my name?

114
00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:18.179
It's stenciled on the back
of your shorts.

115
00:12:18.263 --> 00:12:21.807
<i>(Men shouting, indistinct)</i>

116
00:12:26.772 --> 00:12:29.732
<i>(Man) Release the cable!</i>

117
00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:49.335
- Where are the bodies?
- We have a morgue.

118
00:12:49.461 --> 00:12:53.381
We put them there until the investigative team
arrives in about a week, I think.

119
00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:55.925
<i>(Clattering)</i>

120
00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:59.720
- There was a droid.
- Disconnected.

121
00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:02.306
There were bits and pieces of him
all over the place.

122
00:13:02.391 --> 00:13:04.475
We put what was left
on the rubbish tip.

123
00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:07.937
The corporal was impaled
by that safety support.

124
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:09.981
He never knew what hit him.

125
00:13:10.065 --> 00:13:12.441
And the girl?

126
00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:15.861
She drowned in her cryo-tube.

127
00:13:15.946 --> 00:13:20.366
I don't think she was conscious
when it happened.

128
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.619
Um, I'm sorry.

129
00:13:23.704 --> 00:13:26.455
<i>(Sobbing)</i>

130
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.499
<i>(Exhales)</i>

131
00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:45.273
- <i>(Gasps)
- (Clemens) What's the matter?</i>

132
00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:48.818
- Where is she?
- <i>In the morgue.</i>

133
00:13:48.903 --> 00:13:50.820
I have to see her.

134
00:13:52.239 --> 00:13:54.157
I have to see what's left of her.

135
00:13:55.242 --> 00:13:57.160
<i>(Clattering)</i>

136
00:13:59.664 --> 00:14:02.277
Oh, God, there you are.

137
00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:07.171
I've been looking everywhere for you!
Where you been, huh?!

138
00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:10.799
<i>(Panting, whimpering)</i>

139
00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:13.593
Oh, my--

140
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:18.974
<i>Come here.</i>

141
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.145
You okay? Let me see, Spike.
Let me see. Are you okay?

142
00:14:24.271 --> 00:14:27.440
- Let me see.
- <i>(Panting)</i>

143
00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:31.611
<i>What have you been sticking
your face into, huh? Here.</i>

144
00:14:32.989 --> 00:14:35.323
Did somebody do this to you?

145
00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:43.581
What kind of animal
would do this to a dog?

146
00:15:10.192 --> 00:15:12.193
Um--

147
00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.696
C-could I have a moment
alone, please?

148
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.740
Yes, of course.

149
00:15:30.713 --> 00:15:33.173
<i>(Deep sigh)</i>

150
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:51.942
<i>(Softly)</i> Forgive me.

151
00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:18.760
<i>(Whispering)</i> What's she doing?

152
00:16:30.773 --> 00:16:33.275
Okay?

153
00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:35.569
No.

154
00:16:36.654 --> 00:16:38.530
We have to do an autopsy.

155
00:16:38.656 --> 00:16:40.365
- What?
- I told you...

156
00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:42.701
we have to make sure
how she died.

157
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.414
And I told <i>you,</i> she drowned.

158
00:16:47.498 --> 00:16:53.044
I'm not so sure.
I-I have to see inside of her.

159
00:16:53.129 --> 00:16:55.547
<i>You're disorientated.
Half your system's still in--</i>

160
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:57.632
I have a very, <i>very</i> good reason.

161
00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:00.101
Well, perhaps you'd like to
share that reason.

162
00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.932
Possible contagion.

163
00:17:06.017 --> 00:17:08.894
<i>What kind exactly?</i>

164
00:17:08.978 --> 00:17:10.979
- Cholera.
- Cholera?

165
00:17:14.817 --> 00:17:17.611
There hasn't been a case of cholera
reported for 200 years.

166
00:17:24.202 --> 00:17:26.203
<i>(Softly)</i> Please.

167
00:17:34.212 --> 00:17:36.171
<i>(Water gurgling)</i>

168
00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:40.675
<i>(Cutting skin)</i>

169
00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:55.523
<i>(Yawns)</i>

170
00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:05.700
Everything's in place.

171
00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:09.162
There's no sign of infection.

172
00:18:09.247 --> 00:18:11.957
- No indication of disease.
- Chest.

173
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:14.000
Open the chest.

174
00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:24.511
Careful.

175
00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:40.360
<i>(Bones cracking)</i>

176
00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:48.076
<i>(Sobbing)</i>

177
00:18:55.918 --> 00:18:58.211
Lungs.

178
00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.590
Flooded with fluid.

179
00:19:04.427 --> 00:19:06.720
Ergo, she drowned.

180
00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:17.689
Now, since I'm not a complete idiot...

181
00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:21.609
would you like to tell me
what we're really looking for?

182
00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.871
Mr. Clemens.

183
00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:34.873
Superintendent.

184
00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.961
I don't believe you've met
Lieutenant Ripley.

185
00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:42.047
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

186
00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:44.257
That's right, sir.
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

187
00:19:45.634 --> 00:19:47.635
- Well, first...
- <i>(Clattering)</i>

188
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.557
the lieutenant is feeling much better,
I'm happy to say.

189
00:19:52.641 --> 00:19:55.101
Second, in the interest
of public health,

190
00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:57.896
- <i>I am performing an autopsy.</i>
- Without my authority.

191
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.398
Well, there didn't seem to be time.

192
00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:02.359
But it's turned out all right.

193
00:20:02.485 --> 00:20:04.903
- <i>There's no sign of contagion in the body.</i>
- Good.

194
00:20:04.987 --> 00:20:08.740
<i>But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley
didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,</i>

195
00:20:08.824 --> 00:20:10.950
as I am told she did in the last hour.

196
00:20:11.035 --> 00:20:12.952
It might also be helpful...

197
00:20:13.037 --> 00:20:16.081
<i>if you kept me informed as to
any change in her physical status.</i>

198
00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:18.141
Or would that be asking too much?

199
00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:19.967
We have to cremate the bodies.

200
00:20:20.967 --> 00:20:24.047
Nonsense. We'll keep the bodies on ice
till the rescue team arrives.

201
00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:28.510
- On ice.
- There is the public health issue.

202
00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:33.598
The lieutenant feels that there is still
a possibility of a communicable infection.

203
00:20:35.684 --> 00:20:37.936
I thought you said
there was no sign of disease.

204
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.146
<i>(Clemens) It would appear
that the child drowned.</i>

205
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:42.774
<i>But without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests,</i>

206
00:20:42.858 --> 00:20:44.776
<i>it's impossible to be
absolutely certain.</i>

207
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.112
I would consider it unwise...

208
00:20:47.196 --> 00:20:50.949
to tolerate even the possibility
of an unwelcome virus.

209
00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:55.495
An outbreak of <i>cholera</i>
would look extremely bad on a report.

210
00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:57.914
- <i>Would it not, sir?
- (Clears throat)</i>

211
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.001
We've 25 prisoners in this facility.

212

All double-Y-chromos.

213
00:21:04.255 --> 00:21:08.466
All thieves, rapists, murderers,
child molesters. All scum.

214
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:13.304
<i>Just because they've taken on religion
doesn't make them any less dangerous.</i>

215
00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:15.807
I try not to offend their convictions.

216
00:21:15.891 --> 00:21:18.393
<i>I don't want to upset the order.</i>

217
00:21:19.562 --> 00:21:21.980
I don't want ripples in the water.

218
00:21:22.064 --> 00:21:27.068
And I don't want a woman
walking around giving them ideas.

219
00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:31.197
I see.
For my own personal safety.

220
00:21:32.366 --> 00:21:34.325
Exactly.

But I don't think now is the moment.

- <i>(Assistant on intercom) Mr. Clemens.</i>

345
00:33:34.787 --> 00:33:38.581
Mr. Aaron. Superintendent Andrews
would like you to report...

346
00:33:38.666 --> 00:33:42.377
to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrant...
now.

347
00:33:42.503 --> 00:33:44.546
We've had an accident.
Something serious?

348
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:49.968
You could call it that.
One of our prisoners has been... diced.

349
00:33:50.052 --> 00:33:53.805
Sorry. I have to go.

350
00:33:56.183 --> 00:33:58.184

- Murphy.

How do you know?

355
00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.721
That's his boot.

356
00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:39.184
I gave him the assignment, sir.
He was a wanker.

357
00:34:39.268 --> 00:34:41.686
No apologies, Mr. Aaron.
It wasn't your fault.

358
00:34:53.532 --> 00:34:55.658
Well, not much to say, is there?

359
00:34:55.743 --> 00:34:58.787
- Death was instantaneous.
- No shit.

360
00:34:58.871 --> 00:35:01.247
I take it he was pulled
into the fan.

361
00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:03.291
Sudden rush of air,
I'd imagine, except-

362
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:05.460
Right.
Almost happened to me once.

363
00:35:05.544 --> 00:35:09.923
I've told him so many times,
"Stay away from the fans."

364
00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.925
Nobody bloody listens.

365
00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:15.136
Except the fan was blowing.

366
00:35:22.103 --> 00:35:24.187
- What's that?
- I don't know.

367
00:35:24.271 --> 00:35:29.067
I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes,
if you'll please, Mr. Clemens.

368
00:35:34.573 --> 00:35:37.450
<i>(Aaron) Have you got any ideas?</i>

is really gonna piss
Superintendent Andrews off.

373
00:36:30.133 --> 00:36:32.467
Will you tell me about your accident?

374
00:36:32.552 --> 00:36:36.179
One of the prisoners has been killed.

375
00:36:36.306 --> 00:36:38.640
- Really? How?
- Hmm.

376
00:36:38.725 --> 00:36:41.226
In the air shaft.

377
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:43.812
Poor soul backed into a nine-foot fan.

378
00:36:44.981 --> 00:36:47.357
I found something
at the accident site,

379
00:36:47.442 --> 00:36:50.861
just a bit away
from where it happened.

380
00:36:50.945 --> 00:36:54.489
A mark. A burn.

381
00:36:55.992 --> 00:36:58.910
Rather like the one you found
on the girl's cryo-tube.

382
00:37:05.293 --> 00:37:09.212
Look. I'm on your side.

383
00:37:09.297 --> 00:37:12.758
I want to help, but I need to know
what's going on...

384
00:37:12.842 --> 00:37:15.218
or what you think is going on.

385
00:37:17.847 --> 00:37:19.890
If you really wanna help,

386
00:37:19.974 --> 00:37:22.100
find me a computer
with audio capabilities...

387
00:37:22.185 --> 00:37:24.353
so I can access this flight recorder.

388
00:37:24.437 --> 00:37:26.563
We don't have anything
like that here.

389
00:37:26.689 --> 00:37:28.815
- <i>(Sighs)</i> Well, what about Bishop?
- Bishop?

390
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.443
The droid that crashed with me.

391
00:37:31.527 --> 00:37:33.904
I can point you in the right direction.

392
00:37:33.988 --> 00:37:35.947
I can't join you.

393
00:37:36.032 --> 00:37:39.242
I have a previous engagement.

Listen to me, you piece of shit.

I'm sorry.
I don't think I understand.

397
00:37:49.462 --> 00:37:52.464
At 0700 hours, I received word
from the network.

398
00:37:52.548 --> 00:37:55.425
I may point out this is the first
high-level communication...

399
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.638
this installation has ever received,
to my knowledge.

400
00:37:59.722 --> 00:38:01.598
They want this woman looked after.

401
00:38:01.724 --> 00:38:04.434
- They consider her to be very high priority.
- Why?

402
00:38:04.519 --> 00:38:06.812
I have no idea.

403
00:38:06.896 --> 00:38:10.190
But why did you let her
out of the infirmary?

404
00:38:10.274 --> 00:38:12.442
This accident with Murphy
is what happens...

405
00:38:12.527 --> 00:38:15.529
when one of these dumb sons of a bitches
walks around with a hard-on.

406
00:38:15.613 --> 00:38:18.323
I'm a doctor. You're the jailer.

407
00:38:20.076 --> 00:38:23.703
We both know exactly what you are.

408
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.957
- Sit down.
- I think it might be better if I left.

409
00:38:27.041 --> 00:38:30.752
I find you...
unpleasant to be around.

410
00:38:30.837 --> 00:38:34.172
You do? Isn't that lovely?
Consider this, Mr. Clemens.

411
00:38:34.257 --> 00:38:37.384
How would you like me to explain
your sordid history...

413
00:38:39.804 --> 00:38:43.598
For her personal edification, of course.

414
00:38:43.683 --> 00:38:46.268
Now sit the hell down.

415
00:38:57.447 --> 00:39:00.866

- What happened?

489
00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.178
What started the fire, Bishop?

Can you hear me?

491

<i>(Normal voice)</i>
The fire was electrical.

492
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:55.895
It was in the subflooring.

493
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.566
Did the sensors pick up anything moving around
on the ship prior to separation?

494
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.111
It's very dark here, Ripley.
I'm not what I used to be.

495
00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:07.574
Just tell me. Does the recorder
indicate anything?

Yes.

00:47:16.792 --> 00:47:20.879
Is it on the <i>Sulaco</i> or did it
come with us on the E.E.V.?

The company knows everything

It all goes into the computer

00:48:21.692 --> 00:48:23.860
Feeds on minds. It was--

515
00:48:23.986 --> 00:48:26.321
- Nobody can stop it.
- What about Boggs and Rains?

516
00:48:26.406 --> 00:48:28.740
They got s-slaughtered like pigs.
It wasn't me!

517
00:48:28.825 --> 00:48:33.578
- It wasn't me!
- Stark raving mad.

518
00:48:33.663 --> 00:48:36.331
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault,
but he should have been chained up.

519
00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:39.751
You called it, sir.
Mad as a fucking hatter.

520
00:48:39.836 --> 00:48:43.630
Keep him separated from the rest.
I don't want him causing a panic.

521
00:48:43.714 --> 00:48:44.782
- Clemens?
- Yeah?

522
00:48:44.882 --> 00:48:45.933
Sedate this poor idiot.

523
00:48:45.967 --> 00:48:48.385
Not until we know about the brothers.

524
00:48:48.469 --> 00:48:52.305
Now, now. Pull yourself together.
Talk to me now.

525
00:48:52.432 --> 00:48:55.308
- <i>Now, where are Boggs and Rains?
- It wasn't me!</i>

526
00:48:55.393 --> 00:48:57.269
<i>(Andrews) Hopeless. You're not gonna
get anything out of him.</i>

527
00:48:57.395 --> 00:49:00.230
- <i>It wasn't me.
- We'll have to send out a search team.</i>

528
00:49:00.314 --> 00:49:02.649
<i>I'm afraid we'll have to assume
there's a very good chance...</i>

529
00:49:02.733 --> 00:49:05.068
this simple bastard has murdered them.

530
00:49:06.946 --> 00:49:09.322
Now, you don't know that.

531
00:49:10.324 --> 00:49:13.076
He's never lied to me.

532
00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:16.413
He's crazy, he's a fool,
but he's not a liar.

533
00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:20.792
He's telling the truth.

534
00:49:20.877 --> 00:49:24.004
I'd like to talk to him
about this... this dragon.

535
00:49:24.088 --> 00:49:27.048
- It was a dragon.
- <i>(Andrews) You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant.</i>

536
00:49:27.133 --> 00:49:30.010
I'm not interested in your opinion,

537
00:49:30.094 --> 00:49:32.220
because you are not
in full possession of the facts.

538
00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:35.849
This man is a convicted multiple murderer,
known for particularly brutal crimes.

539
00:49:35.933 --> 00:49:38.602
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?

540
00:49:38.686 --> 00:49:41.480
Yeah. That part's right.

541
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.401
Then I'll talk to you.
It's important.

542
00:49:46.486 --> 00:49:48.904
When I have finished
with my official duties,

543
00:49:48.988 --> 00:49:52.115
I will be quite pleased
to have a little chat, yes?

544
00:49:56.496 --> 00:50:01.875
Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant.
It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,

545
00:50:01.959 --> 00:50:06.213
with acid for blood, and it arrived
on your spaceship.

546
00:50:06.297 --> 00:50:09.799
It kills on sight
and is generally unpleasant.

547
00:50:09.884 --> 00:50:12.427
And, of course, you expect me
to accept all this on your word.

548
00:50:12.512 --> 00:50:14.888
No, I don't expect anything.

549
00:50:14.972 --> 00:50:19.809
- Quite a story, Mr. Aaron.
- Right, sir. It's a beauty.

550
00:50:19.894 --> 00:50:22.854
- Never heard anything quite like it, sir.
- Expect not.

551
00:50:22.939 --> 00:50:25.023
Tell me, Lieutenant,
what would you suggest we do?

552
00:50:27.401 --> 00:50:29.819
Well, what kind of weapons
have you got?

553
00:50:29.904 --> 00:50:31.905
This is a prison.

554
00:50:31.989 --> 00:50:34.449
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners
access to firearms.

555
00:50:34.534 --> 00:50:36.326
What keeps them from killing you?

556
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.371
Fear. There's no way to escape.

557
00:50:39.455 --> 00:50:43.416
With the arrival of the next supply ship,
the company would eliminate them.

558
00:50:43.501 --> 00:50:47.379
This is a maximum security prison,

559
00:50:48.881 --> 00:50:52.592
and you have no weapons of any kind?

560
00:50:54.887 --> 00:50:58.682
We have some carving knives in the abattoir.
A few more in the mess hall.

561
00:50:58.766 --> 00:51:02.185
Some fire axes scattered about the place.
Nothing terribly formidable.

562
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.562
That's all?

563
00:51:03.646 --> 00:51:05.397
We're on the honor system.

564
00:51:11.449 --> 00:51:15.618
- Then we're fucked.
- No, you're fucked!

565
00:51:15.703 --> 00:51:19.122
Confined to the infirmary. Quarantined.

566
00:51:19.206 --> 00:51:21.916
Mr. Aaron will escort you.

567
00:51:22.001 --> 00:51:26.296
I think you'll be safe from any large,
nasty beast while you're there, right?

568
00:51:28.299 --> 00:51:31.468
Yes, that's a good girl.

569
00:51:31.594 --> 00:51:34.345
- <i>(Intercom buzzes)</i>
- <i>(Aaron) Let's all report to the mess hall.</i>

570
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:39.267
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting.
Mess hall, right away, people.

571
00:51:39.351 --> 00:51:42.645
Isn't there any way off of this place?
Some way to escape?

572
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:46.483
<i>(Laughs)</i> No. Supply ship
comes every six months.

573
00:51:47.026 --> 00:51:49.319
- And that's it?
- And that's it.

574
00:51:49.403 --> 00:51:51.112
Fuck.

575
00:51:52.323 --> 00:51:56.534
They are sending somebody
to pick you up quite soon, I gather.

576
00:51:56.619 --> 00:51:59.454
Really. <i>(Coughs)</i>
What's "soon"?

577
00:51:59.538 --> 00:52:04.209
I don't know. Nobody's ever been
in a hurry to get here before.

578
00:52:06.879 --> 00:52:09.798
Do you want to tell me
what you and Andrews talked about?

579
00:52:09.882 --> 00:52:12.133
No.

580
00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:16.262
- You'll just say I'm crazy.
- <i>(Liquid swishing)</i>

581
00:52:16.347 --> 00:52:22.268
- That's a bit uncharitable.
- <i>(Inhales, coughing)</i>

582
00:52:25.439 --> 00:52:27.440
How are you feeling?

583
00:52:27.525 --> 00:52:31.653
<i>(Sighs)</i> Not so hot.
<i>(Clears Throat)</i>

584
00:52:31.737 --> 00:52:33.655
Sore throat.

585
00:52:33.739 --> 00:52:37.659
Sick to my stomach.
Pissed off.

586
00:52:37.743 --> 00:52:41.579
Well, that's understandable
given the circumstances.

587
00:52:41.664 --> 00:52:45.166
Perhaps I should give you
one of my special cocktails.

588
00:52:45.292 --> 00:52:48.086
<i>(Golic) I don't know why everybody
blames everybody for everything.</i>

589
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.755
Nobody's perfect, only human.

590
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.925
I don't know a perfect human.
Nobody I know.

591
00:52:55.302 --> 00:52:58.179
You married?

592
00:52:58.264 --> 00:53:00.849
- Me?
- You should get married, have kids.

593
00:53:00.933 --> 00:53:06.062
Pretty girl. I used to know
lots of 'em back home.

594
00:53:06.147 --> 00:53:09.107
They used to like me.

595
00:53:11.527 --> 00:53:13.444
For a while.

596
00:53:18.534 --> 00:53:20.493
You're gonna die too.

597
00:53:28.544 --> 00:53:32.255
- Are you?
- What?

598
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:34.591
Married.

599
00:53:34.675 --> 00:53:37.093
<i>(Ripley) Why?</i>

600
00:53:37.178 --> 00:53:40.430
- Just curious.
- No.

601
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.811
How about leveling with me?

602
00:53:46.896 --> 00:53:50.565
When I asked how you got assigned here,
you avoided the question.

603
00:53:50.649 --> 00:53:53.818
And then when I asked about the prison I.D.
tattooed on the back of your head,

604
00:53:53.903 --> 00:53:55.778
you ducked me again.

605
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:00.992
It's a long, sad story...

606
00:54:02.203 --> 00:54:04.495
and more than a little melodramatic.

607
00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.998
Try me.

608
00:54:09.001 --> 00:54:11.502
- <i>(Liquid swishing)</i>
- If you insist.

609
00:54:16.217 --> 00:54:18.551
After my student years,

610
00:54:19.637 --> 00:54:22.639
despite the fact that I had become...

611
00:54:22.723 --> 00:54:25.141
secretly addicted to morphine,

612
00:54:25.226 --> 00:54:27.477
I was considered
to be most promising,

613
00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:29.979
a man with a future.

614
00:54:32.983 --> 00:54:37.278
And during my first residency,
I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.

615
00:54:38.572 --> 00:54:42.116
So, I went out and I got
more than a little drunk.

616
00:54:42.201 --> 00:54:44.327
Then I got called back.

617
00:54:44.411 --> 00:54:46.579
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,

618
00:54:46.664 --> 00:54:49.791
and there were 30 casualties

619
00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:52.168
and 11 of them died.

620
00:54:52.253 --> 00:54:54.420
Not as a result of the accident...

621
00:54:54.505 --> 00:54:56.965
but because I prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller.

622
00:54:59.093 --> 00:55:03.096
I got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3-C.

623
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.393
At least I got off the morphine.

624
00:55:08.477 --> 00:55:10.645
I'm sorry.

625
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:14.565
I think I was let off lightly.

626
00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:17.610
Did you serve your time here?

627
00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.699
I got to know
this motley crew quite well.

628
00:55:22.783 --> 00:55:26.619
So when they stayed, I stayed.

629
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.415
Nobody else would employ me.

630
00:55:33.794 --> 00:55:37.588
So, do you still trust me
with a needle?

631
00:56:07.369 --> 00:56:09.954
<i>(Hisses, screeches)</i>

632
00:56:12.916 --> 00:56:14.042
<i>(Whimpering)</i>

633
00:56:28.432 --> 00:56:31.768
- <i>(Growls, hisses)</i>
- <i>(Yelps)</i>

634
00:56:42.613 --> 00:56:45.740
<i>(Whimpering)</i>

635
00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:58.294
Once again, this is rumor control.

636
00:56:58.379 --> 00:57:00.880
Here are the facts.

637
00:57:00.964 --> 00:57:03.633
At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,

638
00:57:03.717 --> 00:57:06.594
through carelessness on his part,

639
00:57:06.678 --> 00:57:09.472
was found dead in vent shaft 17.

640
00:57:09.556 --> 00:57:12.100
He seems to have been
sucked into a ventilator fan.

641
00:57:13.487 --> 00:57:15.488
<i>(Gasping)</i>

642
00:57:15.572 --> 00:57:18.324
At about 2100 hours,

643
00:57:18.408 --> 00:57:22.536
prisoner Golic reappeared
in a deranged state.

644
00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:24.914
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing.

645
00:57:24.998 --> 00:57:29.668
There seems to be a good chance
that they have met with foul play...

646
00:57:29.753 --> 00:57:33.005
- at the hands of prisoner Golic.
- <i>(Mutters)</i>

647
00:57:34.966 --> 00:57:37.802
We need to organize
and send out a search party.

648
00:57:39.638 --> 00:57:42.515
Volunteers will be appreciated.

649
00:57:45.102 --> 00:57:49.271
I think it's fair to say
that our smoothly running facility...

650
00:57:49.356 --> 00:57:52.191
has suddenly developed
a few problems.

651
00:57:52.275 --> 00:57:58.155
I can only hope we are able to all
pull together over the next few days...

652
00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.450
until the rescue team arrives
for Lieutenant Ripley.

653
00:58:01.535 --> 00:58:03.494
It's here! It got Clemens!

654
00:58:03.578 --> 00:58:07.289
- Stop this raving at once! Stop it!
- I'm telling you, it's here!

655
00:58:07.374 --> 00:58:10.292
Aaron, get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary!

656
00:58:10.377 --> 00:58:13.504
- <i>(Screams)</i>
- <i>(All shouting)</i>

657
00:58:13.588 --> 00:58:15.548
<i>(Man) Move it!</i>

658
00:58:16.975 --> 00:58:18.225
Out of my way!

659
00:58:21.854 --> 00:58:23.855
Fuck!

660
00:58:29.195 --> 00:58:33.949
<i>(Man) What do we do now?
Who's in charge?</i>

661
00:58:34.033 --> 00:58:36.535
Organize. We gotta organize, right?

662
00:58:36.619 --> 00:58:39.329
Right. Well, I guess
I'm next in line.

663
00:58:39.414 --> 00:58:43.000
- 85's gonna be in charge. Jesus, give us a break!
- Don't call me that.

664
00:58:43.084 --> 00:58:45.460
<i>(Aaron) Okay, look. There's no way
I can replace Andrews.</i>

665
00:58:45.545 --> 00:58:48.255
He was a good man. I know
you guys didn't appreciate him.

666
00:58:48.339 --> 00:58:51.508
Aaron, we don't want
to hear that shit now.

667
00:58:51.593 --> 00:58:54.636
Hey, sister, what about you?
You're an officer.

668
00:58:54.721 --> 00:58:56.638
How about showing us
a little leadership?

669
00:58:56.723 --> 00:58:58.682
Forget fucking Shirley Temple.
You take charge.

670
00:58:58.766 --> 00:59:01.018
- Right.
- You run things here anyway.

671
00:59:01.102 --> 00:59:06.106
No fuckin' way.
I'm not the officer type.

672
00:59:07.191 --> 00:59:09.359
I just take care of my own.

673
00:59:09.444 --> 00:59:12.654
Well, what does this fucking beast want?

674
00:59:14.782 --> 00:59:16.700
Is this mother gonna try for us all?

675
00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:22.664
- Yeah.
- Well, ain't that sweet?

676
00:59:22.749 --> 00:59:25.542
- So how are we gonna stop it?
- <i>(Clears throat)</i>

677
00:59:29.088 --> 00:59:31.882
- We have no weapons. Is that correct?
- Right.

678
00:59:31.966 --> 00:59:35.677
I haven't seen one
exactly like this before.

679
00:59:35.762 --> 00:59:38.221
Moves differently.

680
00:59:40.308 --> 00:59:42.809
But the others were afraid of fire...

681
00:59:42.894 --> 00:59:44.895
not much else.

682
00:59:46.189 --> 00:59:49.358
- Can we seal off this area?
- No chance.

683
00:59:49.442 --> 00:59:51.610
The installation's 10 miles square.

684
00:59:51.736 --> 00:59:53.987
- There's 600 air ducts running to the surface.
- What about video?

685
00:59:54.072 --> 00:59:57.783
I see these closed-circuit monitors everywhere.
We could try to find it that way.

686
00:59:57.867 --> 01:00:01.995
The video system hasn't worked in years.
Nothing much works here.

687
01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.289
We got a lot of technology,
no way to fix it.

688
01:00:04.374 --> 01:00:06.792
- What 85 is trying to tell you is-
- Don't call me that!

689
01:00:06.876 --> 01:00:09.961
we ain't got no entertainment center,
no climate control,

690
01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:12.631
no video system, no surveillance,

691
01:00:12.715 --> 01:00:16.218
no freezers, no fucking ice cream,

692
01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:19.096
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

693
01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.264
All we got here is shit!

694
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:24.059
Oh, what the hell are we
even talking to her for?

695
01:00:24.143 --> 01:00:26.520
She's the one that brought the fucker.

696
01:00:26.604 --> 01:00:30.899
Why don't we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall?

697
01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:33.610
<i>(Dillon) Hey, Morse.</i>

698
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:39.741
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

699
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:42.911
Hmm.

700
01:00:45.707 --> 01:00:47.708
Right.

701
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.753
Right. What are we going to do?

702
01:01:06.275 --> 01:01:08.734
- What's this?
- Um,

703
01:01:08.819 --> 01:01:11.904
that leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary.

704
01:01:11.989 --> 01:01:13.990
It's a ventilation shaft.

705
01:01:14.074 --> 01:01:17.410
Then we go in there, flush it out.

706
01:01:17.494 --> 01:01:21.497
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles and miles
of tunnel through there.

707
01:01:22.499 --> 01:01:24.500
It won't go far.

708
01:01:25.544 --> 01:01:27.837
It'll nest in this area.

709
01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:29.922
Right around...

710
01:01:30.924 --> 01:01:34.427
- here.
- How do you know that?

711
01:01:35.679 --> 01:01:38.222
It's like a lion.

712
01:01:38.307 --> 01:01:40.516
It sticks close to the zebras.

713
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.019
Zebras? Oh, right.

714
01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:45.771
But, look. Running around down here
in the dark. Are you kidding?

715
01:01:45.856 --> 01:01:48.232
Once you get out of this main shaft,
there's no overheads.

716
01:01:48.358 --> 01:01:51.485
- Don't we have flashlights?
- We got thousands of 'em, but no batteries.

717
01:01:51.611 --> 01:01:54.405
- I told you, nothing works.
- Torches?

718
01:01:54.489 --> 01:01:57.491
Do we have the capacity
to make fire?

719
01:01:57.576 --> 01:02:00.870
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the Stone Age.

720
01:02:01.955 --> 01:02:04.206
No need to be sarcastic.

721
01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:09.879
Never been used. They were gonna
dump a lot of nuclear crap in there.

722
01:02:09.963 --> 01:02:13.090
Never got around to it.
It's clean as a whistle inside.

723
01:02:13.175 --> 01:02:15.634
This the only way in or out?

724
01:02:15.719 --> 01:02:19.472
That's right. Walls are
six feet thick, solid steel.

725
01:02:19.556 --> 01:02:21.974
Really knew how
to build these babies.

726
01:02:22.059 --> 01:02:24.977
You're saying we get
something in there,

727
01:02:25.062 --> 01:02:27.521
there's no way it can get out?

728
01:02:27.606 --> 01:02:30.858
That's right. No fucking way.

729
01:02:34.571 --> 01:02:36.405
<i>(Whistles)</i>

730
01:02:37.824 --> 01:02:40.201
This is where we keep it.
I forget what the stuff's called.

731
01:02:40.285 --> 01:02:43.788
- Quinitricetyline.
- I knew that.

732
01:02:43.872 --> 01:02:47.124
Right. I've got to get these section
arrangements organized with Dillon...

733
01:02:47.209 --> 01:02:49.835
for the paintbrush, uh...

734
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.296
- So, um...
- David.

735
01:02:51.422 --> 01:02:56.467
- Yeah. You can get these drums organized.
- Right, 85.

736
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:59.929
And, uh... don't call me that.

737
01:03:02.432 --> 01:03:06.352
What's this "85" thing?

738
01:03:06.436 --> 01:03:09.730
Couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived.

739
01:03:09.815 --> 01:03:11.816
It's his I.Q.

740
01:03:18.949 --> 01:03:21.075
I saw a drum of this stuff...

741
01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:23.327
fall into a beachhead bunker once.

742
01:03:23.412 --> 01:03:26.872
The blast put a tug
in dry dock for 17 weeks.

743
01:03:26.957 --> 01:03:27.748
Great stuff!

744
01:03:33.514 --> 01:03:36.558
All right.
Let me get this straight.

745
01:03:36.642 --> 01:03:40.061
You want to burn it down
and out of the pipes,

746
01:03:40.146 --> 01:03:42.313
force it in here, slam the door...

747
01:03:42.398 --> 01:03:45.024
- and trap its ass?
- Right.

748
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:48.945
And you want help
from us Y-chromo boys, huh?

749
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:50.905
You got something better to do?

750
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:53.783
Why should we put our ass
on the line for you?

751
01:03:53.868 --> 01:03:56.035
Your ass is already on the line.

752
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.746
The only question is...

753
01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:00.248
what are you gonna do about it?

754
01:04:00.332 --> 01:04:03.501

01:04:14.054 --> 01:04:16.014
Man, this stuff stinks.

757
01:04:26.192 --> 01:04:28.443
So you miss Doc, right?

758
01:04:31.155 --> 01:04:33.656
What makes you say that?

759
01:04:33.741 --> 01:04:36.075

Well.

There's definitely
something in here with us.

Okay. Don't light the fire

767

That's all you've got?

Hit the sprinklers!

1190
01:41:56.508 --> 01:41:58.967
Douse the fucker!

Stay where you are!

1200
01:43:49.337 --> 01:43:52.672
- Ripley.
- Bishop.

1201
01:43:52.757 --> 01:43:55.258
- I'm here to help you.
- <i>No more bullshit.</i>

1202
01:43:55.343 --> 01:43:57.927
I just felt it move.

1203
01:43:58.012 --> 01:44:01.348
- You know who I am?
- You're a droid.

1204
01:44:01.432 --> 01:44:04.434
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.

1205
01:44:04.518 --> 01:44:08.563
No. I'm not the Bishop android.

1206
01:44:08.648 --> 01:44:10.899
I designed it.

1207
01:44:10.983 --> 01:44:13.485
I'm very human.

1208
01:44:13.569 --> 01:44:15.862
The company sent me here
to show you a friendly face,

1209
01:44:15.946 --> 01:44:19.699
to demonstrate how important
you are to us,

1210
01:44:19.784 --> 01:44:21.409
to me.

1211
01:44:21.494 --> 01:44:24.746
- You just want to take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.

1212
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:29.334
- Bullshit.
- You're wrong. We want to help.

1213
01:44:29.418 --> 01:44:32.337
What does that mean?

1214
01:44:32.463 --> 01:44:36.633
- We're gonna take that out of you.
- <i>(Softly)</i> And keep it.

1215
01:44:36.717 --> 01:44:40.637
Can't allow it to live.
Everything we know would be in jeopardy.

1216
01:44:42.807 --> 01:44:45.058
You don't want to take it back?

1217
01:44:45.142 --> 01:44:46.935
Ripley, time is important.

1218
01:44:48.145 --> 01:44:51.940
<i>We've got a surgical bay set up
on the rescue ship. Come with me.</i>

1219
01:44:54.318 --> 01:44:56.364
You still can have a life.

1220
01:44:58.364 --> 01:44:59.364
Children...

1221
01:45:01.075 --> 01:45:04.160
<i>And most important,
you'll know it's dead.</i>

1222
01:45:04.245 --> 01:45:06.621
Let me help you.

1223
01:45:07.665 --> 01:45:10.166
What guarantee do I have...

1224
01:45:12.128 --> 01:45:13.628
once you've taken it out...

1225
01:45:15.228 --> 01:45:16.428
you'll destroy it?

1226
01:45:17.465 --> 01:45:19.300
You have to trust me.

1227
01:45:24.432 --> 01:45:27.684
Please? Trust me?

1228
01:45:32.314 --> 01:45:33.314
No.

1229
01:45:44.410 --> 01:45:47.120
- What's this gonna achieve?
- <i>(Gunshot, screams)</i>

1230
01:45:47.204 --> 01:45:50.123
- Stop!
- Ow! Oh, Jesus!

1231
01:45:50.207 --> 01:45:53.376
- <i>(Groaning)</i>
- Morse.

1232
01:45:55.838 --> 01:45:56.908
Will you help me?

1233
01:45:58.208 --> 01:46:00.008
What do you want me to do?

1234
01:46:03.137 --> 01:46:06.556
<i>(Bishop) It was a mistake!
There was no need for any of it!</i>

1235
01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.932
Fucking android!

1236
01:46:25.242 --> 01:46:29.704
Ripley, think of all
we could learn from it.

1237
01:46:29.789 --> 01:46:32.916
<i>It's the chance of a lifetime!</i>

1238
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.004
You must let me have it!
It's a magnificent specimen!

1239

<i>(Softly)</i> What are you doing?

1240
01:47:04.031 --> 01:47:06.407
