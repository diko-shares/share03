00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:07.794
<i>Stasis interrupted.
Fire in cryogenic compartment.</i>

2
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:12.382
<i>Repeat.
Fire in cryogenic compartment.</i>

3
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:15.385
<i>All personnel report to...</i>

4
00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.180
<i>emergency escape vehicle.</i>

5
00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:23.018
<i>Launch of the escape lifeboat
will commence...</i>

6
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:27.022
<i>in T-minus 20 seconds.</i>

7
00:06:23.852 --> 00:06:25.579
An E.E.V.'s come down.

8
00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:28.930
<i>Get down to the beach.
There may be others.</i>

9
00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:31.446
Now!

10
00:06:46.407 --> 00:06:47.949
Talk to me.

11
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.953
Come on. Come on.

12
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.268
Hey, Frank! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

13
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:16.741
Wait!

14
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.191
Get goin', Frank. Get in there.

15
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.679
Oh! Jesus Christ!

16
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.194
Hell of a way to make a landing!

17
00:08:50.523 --> 00:08:51.655
Use the torch.

18
00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:56.773
- How many?
- Don't know.

19
00:08:57.983 --> 00:08:59.733
Three. Maybe four.

20
00:08:59.944 --> 00:09:04.335
Hey, Frank. Can we hurry this up?
It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes.

21
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:33.031
All right, all right.
Let's get it going.

22
00:09:33.122 --> 00:09:35.928
<i>Keep it together.
Come on. Right.</i>

23
00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:38.170
Right. Here we go, Mr. Dillon.

24
00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.640
Give us strength,
O Lord, to endure.

25
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:54.219
We recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry God.

26
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.570
Let the circle be unbroken...

27
00:09:58.156 --> 00:09:59.726
until the day.

28
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.281
- Amen.
- Amen.

29
00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.990
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.
This is rumor control.</i>

30
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.618
Here are the facts.

31
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.583
As some of you know,

32
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.666
a 337 model E.E.V...

33
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.961
crash-landed here at 0600...

34
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.786
on the morning watch.

35
00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:33.258
There was one survivor,

36
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:37.336
<i>two dead and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair.</i>

37
00:10:37.391 --> 00:10:40.390
The survivor is a woman.

38
00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.060
<i>That's what I saw.</i>

39
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.688
I just want to say that I've taken
a vow of celibacy.

40
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.065
<i>- So have we all.</i>
- That also includes women.

41
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.276
<i>- Yes.</i>
- We've all taken the vow!

42
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:54.028
<i>- Shut your gob, Morse.
- I'd like to say that I, for one,</i>

43
00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.614
<i>do not appreciate company policy
allowing her to freely...</i>

44
00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.825
intermingle with inmates
and the rest of the staff.

45
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:03.580
What brother means to say is we view
the presence of any outsider,

46
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:08.293
especially a woman,
as a violation of the harmony,

47
00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.295
<i>a potential break
in the spiritual unity.</i>

48
00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:13.006
We are well aware
of your feelings in this matter.

49
00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:17.719
You will be pleased to know
that I have requested a rescue team.

50
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.388
<i>Hopefully, they will be here
inside of a weekâ€”</i>

51
00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:24.559
<i>- Oh, come on!</i>
- and evacuate her A.S.A.P.

52
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.561
<i>Don't give us that!</i>

53
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.521
What's her medical status?

54
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.523
She doesn't seem
too badly damaged.

55
00:11:30.907 --> 00:11:34.444
<i>She's unconscious. Can't give you
a more specific diagnosis at the moment.</i>

56
00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.905
- Will she live?
- I would think so.

57
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.658
Look. It's in
everybody's interest...

58
00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:44.454
the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary
until the rescue team arrives.

59
00:11:44.723 --> 00:11:48.293
- And certainly not without an escort, right?
- Sir.

60
00:11:49.738 --> 00:11:54.297
<i>Gentlemen, we should all stick
to our set routine...</i>

61
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.549
and not get unduly agitated.

62
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.134
<i>- Right.
- Correct?</i>

63
00:11:58.761 --> 00:11:59.825
All right.

64
00:12:01.424 --> 00:12:02.768
Thank you, gentlemen.

65
00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:09.183
All right.

66
00:12:09.425 --> 00:12:12.190
<i>Better get here soon or
there ain't gonna be much left.</i>

67
00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:51.221
What's that?

68
00:12:52.713 --> 00:12:56.359
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix.
Sort of eye-opener.

69
00:12:58.135 --> 00:12:59.086
You a doctor?

70
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.288
My name is Clemens.

71
00:13:01.157 --> 00:13:02.490
I'm the chief medical officer here.

72
00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:05.267
- Here?
<i>- Fury 161.</i>

73
00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:08.642
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's
backwater work prisons,

74
00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:10.907
it grieves me to say.

75
00:13:11.306 --> 00:13:13.084
Do you mind?

76
00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:17.713
This is basically a stabilizer.

77
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:21.237
<i>I really ought to shave your head.</i>

78
00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.387
<i>We have a big problem with lice here.</i>

79
00:13:25.385 --> 00:13:27.417
And when you're feeling better,
I'll give you some clippers,

80
00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:30.292
- and you can tend to your private parts yourself.
- How'd I get here?

81
00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:36.232
<i>You crash-landed in an E.E.V.</i>

82
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:39.819
<i>Evidently separated from your mother ship
before you hit our atmosphere.</i>

83
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:43.239
<i>You have any idea
how long you were in hypersleep?</i>

84
00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.587
'Cause coming out the way you did
can be quite a jolt to the system.

85
00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:48.329
- Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks.
<i>- Indeed.</i>

86
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:55.376
- Where are the others?
- They didn't make it.

87
00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:58.546
- What?
- They didn't survive.

88
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.830
I have to get to the ship.

89
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.588
Have to get to the ship.

90
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:07.805
You're in no condition for that.

91
00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:11.768
You want to get me some clothes,
or should I just go like this?

92
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:16.473
Given the nature of our indigenous population,
I would suggest clothes.

93
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.255
<i>None of them have seen
a woman in years.</i>

94
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.309
Neither have I, for that matter.

95
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.789
This used to be
a 5,000 convict facility,

96
00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:36.042
but it's been reduced
to a custodial staff of 25.

97
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.085
Why?

98
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.125
- Keep the pilot light on.
- The pilot light for what?

99
00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:44.842
Blast furnace. Natural methane.

100
00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.959
We have a foundry,
Lieutenant Ripley.

101
00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:52.209
The inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containers.

102
00:14:52.303 --> 00:14:54.186
How do you know my name?

103
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.730
It's stenciled
on the back of your shorts.

104
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.909
<i>Release the cable!</i>

105
00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.886
- Where are the bodies?
- We have a morgue.

106
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:32.932
We put them there until the investigative
team arrives in about a week, I think.

107
00:15:36.395 --> 00:15:39.060
- There was a droid.
<i>- Disconnected.</i>

108
00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:41.091
There were bits and pieces of him
all over the place.

109
00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:43.330
<i>We put what was left
on the rubbish tip.</i>

110
00:15:43.891 --> 00:15:47.269
The corporal was impaled
by that safety support.

111
00:15:47.979 --> 00:15:49.300
<i>He never knew what hit him.</i>

112
00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.909
And the girl?

113
00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:55.214
<i>She... drowned in her cryo-tube.</i>

114
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.429
<i>I don't think she was conscious...</i>

115
00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:00.218
when it happened.

116
00:16:01.107 --> 00:16:02.506
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

117
00:16:24.002 --> 00:16:24.869
<i>What's the matter?</i>

118
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.096
- Where is she?
<i>- In the morgue.</i>

119
00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:29.752
I have to see her.

120
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.618
I have to see what's left of her.

121
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.107
Is there any particular reason
that you're so insistent?

122
00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:46.443
Yes. I have to be sure
how she died.

123
00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:50.051
I hate to be repetitious
about such a sensitive subject,

124
00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:53.826
but... it is perfectly clear
that she drowned.

125
00:16:59.162 --> 00:17:00.615
Was she your daughter?

126
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.100
No.

127
00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:06.162
She wasn't.

128
00:17:48.704 --> 00:17:50.540
Could I have a moment
alone, please?

129
00:17:51.293 --> 00:17:52.759
Yes, of course.

130
00:18:26.303 --> 00:18:27.648
Forgive me.

131
00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:53.786
What's she doing?

132
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.691
Okay?

133
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.746
No.

134
00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:14.223
We have to do an autopsy.

135
00:19:14.676 --> 00:19:15.988
- What?
- I told you,

136
00:19:16.668 --> 00:19:18.426
we have to make sure
how she died.

137
00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:22.777
And I told you, she drowned.

138
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:24.986
<i>I'm not so sure.</i>

139
00:19:26.393 --> 00:19:28.127
<i>I have to see inside of her.</i>

140
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:31.170
You're disorientated.
Half your system's still inâ€”

141
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:33.455
I have a very,
very good reason.

142
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:35.424
Well, perhaps you'd like to
share that reason.

143
00:19:38.841 --> 00:19:41.216
Possible contagion.

144
00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.927
<i>What kind exactly?</i>

145
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.602
- Cholera.
- Cholera?

146
00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:53.234
There hasn't been a case of cholera
reported for 200 years.

147
00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.441
Please.

148
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.030
Everything's in place.

149
00:20:41.695 --> 00:20:43.491
There's no sign of infection.

150
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.580
<i>- No indication of disease.</i>
- Chest.

151
00:20:48.007 --> 00:20:49.623
Open the chest.

152
00:20:58.132 --> 00:20:59.171
Careful.

153
00:21:32.461 --> 00:21:33.834
Lungs.

154
00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:37.672
<i>Flooded with fluid.</i>

155
00:21:40.227 --> 00:21:41.977
Ergo, she drowned.

156
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.179
<i>Now,</i>

157
00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:51.936
since I'm not
a complete idiot,

158
00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:55.843
would you like to tell me
what we're really looking for?

159
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.579
Mr. Clemens.

160
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:09.868
Superintendent.

161
00:22:12.423 --> 00:22:13.845
<i>I don't believe you've met
Lieutenant Ripley.</i>

162
00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:17.915
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

163
00:22:17.978 --> 00:22:20.064
That's right, sir.
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

164
00:22:21.587 --> 00:22:22.978
Well, firstâ€”

165
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:27.603
The lieutenant is feeling much better,
I'm happy to say.

166
00:22:27.767 --> 00:22:30.150
Second, in the interest
of public health,

167
00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:33.519
<i>- I am performing an autopsy.</i>
- Without my authority.

168
00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:35.614
Well, there didn't seem to be time.

169
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:37.982
But it's turned out all right.

170
00:22:38.364 --> 00:22:40.526
<i>- There's no sign of contagion in the body.</i>
- Good.

171
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.615
<i>But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley
didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,</i>

172
00:22:44.881 --> 00:22:46.881
as I am told she did in the last hour.

173
00:22:47.084 --> 00:22:48.575
It might also be helpful...

174
00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:51.704
<i>If you kept me informed as to
any change in her physical status.</i>

175
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.774
Or would that be asking too much?

176
00:22:53.852 --> 00:22:55.422
We have to cremate the bodies.

177
00:22:56.547 --> 00:22:59.949
Nonsense. We'll keep the bodies
on ice till the rescue team arrives.

178
00:23:00.457 --> 00:23:04.133
- On ice.
- There is the public health issue.

179
00:23:05.348 --> 00:23:09.221
The lieutenant feels that there is still
a possibility of a communicable infection.

180
00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.559
I thought you said
there was no sign of disease.

181
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.769
<i>It would appear that the child drowned.</i>

182
00:23:16.348 --> 00:23:18.397
But without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests,

183
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.399
<i>it's impossible
to be absolutely certain.</i>

184
00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:22.735
I would consider it unwise...

185
00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:26.572
to tolerate even the possibility
of an unwelcome virus.

186
00:23:26.719 --> 00:23:31.031
<i>An outbreak of cholera
would look extremely bad on a report.</i>

187
00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:32.875
<i>Would it not, sir?</i>

188
00:23:35.156 --> 00:23:37.624
We've 25 prisoners in this facility.

189
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:39.793
All double-y-chromos.

190
00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:44.536
All thieves, rapists,
murderers, child molesters. All scum.

191
00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:48.927
<i>Just because they've taken on religion
doesn't make them any less dangerous.</i>

192
00:23:49.365 --> 00:23:51.430
I try not to offend their convictions.

193
00:23:51.755 --> 00:23:54.016
<i>I don't want to upset the order.</i>

194
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.238
I don't want ripples in the water.

195
00:23:58.004 --> 00:24:02.105
And I don't want a woman walking around
giving them ideas.

196
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:06.820
I see. For my own personal safety.

197
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.246
Exactly.

198
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:13.480
I will leave the details of the cremation
to you, Mr. Clemens.

199
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:21.085
They may use the furnace, but I want
everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours.

200
00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:23.212
You called it, sir.

201
00:24:49.405 --> 00:24:52.741
- Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph.
- What do you mean?

202
00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:56.584
- Any dead ox is a good ox.
<i>- You're bloody right.</i>

203
00:24:56.678 --> 00:24:58.725
<i>Smelly bastards, all covered in lice.</i>

204
00:24:58.772 --> 00:25:02.326
There's only seven of the friggin' things left,
and then we're done with them.

205
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.894
God, I hates hosin'
these bastards down.

206
00:25:05.772 --> 00:25:07.983
I always get shite
all over me boots.

207
00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:11.427
- Talkin' of hosing things down, Frankâ€”
- Yeah?

208
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.947
You had the chance,
what would you say to her?

209
00:25:13.976 --> 00:25:16.187
- What do you mean, if I got the chance?
- You know.

210
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:19.309
- If you got the chance.
<i>- You mean, casual like?</i>

211
00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:24.159
Yeah. I mean, how would you put it to her if you
bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere?

212
00:25:24.324 --> 00:25:25.534
No problem!

213
00:25:27.221 --> 00:25:29.778
I've never had any problem
with the ladies.

214
00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:32.781
<i>I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear.
How's it goin'?</i>

215
00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:35.451
Anything I can do to be of service?"

216
00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:38.537
Then I'd give her the look, you
knowâ€” up and down.

217
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.957
And I'd give her the wink,
the dirty smile.

218
00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:44.543
- She'd soon get the picture.
- Yeah, right.

219
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:48.297
And then she'd say,
"Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!"

220
00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:50.512
I'd be happy to kiss her ass.

221
00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:53.031
I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere
she wants.

222
00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:56.624
Yeah, but treat 'em mean,
keep 'em keen.

223
00:25:57.054 --> 00:25:58.006
Right, Frank?

224
00:25:58.078 --> 00:25:59.074
<i>Told you before, Murph.</i>

225
00:26:00.023 --> 00:26:02.853
Treat a queen like a whore
and a whore like a queen.

226
00:26:02.951 --> 00:26:04.397
Can't go wrong.

227
00:26:07.229 --> 00:26:09.218
What do you think killed Babe?

228
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.196
Beats me. She just keeled over.

229
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:15.866
- How old was she?
- The charts say 11.

230
00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:17.252
In her prime.

231
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.775
Never mind.

232
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.245
We'll chop her up later
and throw her in the stew.

233
00:26:22.525 --> 00:26:23.462
Right.

234
00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:28.086
Hey, Frank.

235
00:26:29.202 --> 00:26:30.413
What's this?

236
00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:36.154
"We commit this child...

237
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:39.825
"and this man
to your keeping, O Lord.

238
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:43.078
"Their bodies...

239
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:48.208
"have been taken
from the shadow of our nights.

240
00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:53.755
"They have been released...

241
00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:57.968
from all darkness and pain."

242
00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:05.309
"The child and the man...

243
00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:09.980
<i>"have gone beyond our world.</i>

244
00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:14.281
<i>"They are forever eternal...</i>

245
00:28:14.648 --> 00:28:16.153
<i>"and everlasting.</i>

246
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:28.832
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

247
00:28:30.462 --> 00:28:32.092
<i>Why?</i>

248
00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:36.465
Why are the innocent punished?

249
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.704
<i>Why the sacrifice?</i>

250
00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:49.454
Why the pain?

251
00:28:52.392 --> 00:28:55.025
There aren't any promises.

252
00:28:57.095 --> 00:28:58.892
Nothing's certain.

253
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.451
Only that some get called,
some get saved.

254
00:29:05.048 --> 00:29:09.056
<i>She won't ever know
the hardship and grief...</i>

255
00:29:09.101 --> 00:29:10.853
for those of us left behind.

256
00:29:12.282 --> 00:29:15.796
We commit these bodies
to the void...

257
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.481
with a glad heart.

258
00:29:29.107 --> 00:29:31.269
<i>For within each seed,</i>

259
00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:33.814
there is a promise of a flower.

260
00:29:38.282 --> 00:29:39.861
<i>And within each death,</i>

261
00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:43.024
<i>no matter how small,</i>

262
00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.535
<i>there's always a new life.</i>

263
00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:53.250
A new beginning.

264
00:29:57.925 --> 00:29:58.995
Amen.

265
00:30:01.725 --> 00:30:03.284
Amen.

266
00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:35.805
<i>I'll tell you, it's fucking weird.</i>

267
00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:38.629
<i>The only one to survive
that crash is a woman.</i>

268
00:30:38.821 --> 00:30:40.415
<i>What trouble can she cause?</i>

269
00:30:40.719 --> 00:30:42.637
<i>She's already changed everything.</i>

270
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.430
<i>What the fuck are we supposed to doâ€”</i>

271
00:30:54.832 --> 00:30:56.899
<i>I, for oneâ€”</i>

272
00:30:59.245 --> 00:31:00.831
<i>I mean it!</i>

273
00:31:38.889 --> 00:31:40.842
Okay.

274
00:31:42.787 --> 00:31:47.280
There's a lot of talk going around
that we've got some disharmony here?

275
00:31:48.264 --> 00:31:51.117
<i>Any you guys want to tell me
what the problem is?</i>

276
00:31:54.723 --> 00:31:56.520
Come on.
Speak to me, brothers.

277
00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:59.973
All right. I'll tell ya.

278
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:05.048
I don't mind the dark.
I don't mind the bugs.

279
00:32:05.324 --> 00:32:09.219
I don't mind wanderin' around in some
cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time.

280
00:32:09.244 --> 00:32:10.371
I don't mind anything.

281
00:32:11.241 --> 00:32:12.393
But I mind Golic.

282
00:32:13.941 --> 00:32:15.308
That the way you feel about it?

283
00:32:15.392 --> 00:32:18.628
Yeah. The guy's crazy
and he smells bad.

284
00:32:20.183 --> 00:32:22.160
<i>I ain't going out with him anymore.</i>

285
00:32:26.626 --> 00:32:28.470
You got anything to say for yourself?

286
00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:35.361
Well, he's going with you.

287
00:32:36.413 --> 00:32:41.334
<i>Golic is just another poor, miserable,
suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me.</i>

288
00:32:41.396 --> 00:32:43.281
- 'Cept he smells worse.
- And he's crazy.

289
00:32:43.321 --> 00:32:45.460
Knock off the shit!

290
00:32:47.499 --> 00:32:49.015
You got a job to do.

291
00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.171
<i>I don't want to hear
another word about Golic.</i>

292
00:32:55.891 --> 00:32:57.234
<i>Okay?</i>

293
00:32:59.757 --> 00:33:00.913
Okay?

294
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.224
<i>Well, hello.</i>

295
00:33:58.864 --> 00:34:00.926
As I thought, Mr. Aaron.

296
00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:05.126
- As I thought.
- You called it, sir.

297
00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:16.846
I just wanted to... say thanks for
what you said at the funeral. It was, uhâ€”

298
00:34:19.213 --> 00:34:20.837
My friends would have
appreciated it.

299
00:34:20.862 --> 00:34:22.878
Yeah, well, you don't
wanna know me, lady.

300
00:34:24.393 --> 00:34:26.807
I'm a murderer
and rapist of women.

301
00:34:29.823 --> 00:34:31.042
Really?

302
00:34:34.022 --> 00:34:37.155
Well, I guess
I must make you nervous.

303
00:34:53.311 --> 00:34:56.428
- Do you have any faith, sister?
- Not much.

304
00:34:57.084 --> 00:35:01.391
Well, we've got a lot of faith here.
Enough even for you.

305
00:35:02.912 --> 00:35:04.388
I thought women weren't allowed.

306
00:35:04.615 --> 00:35:06.599
Well, we've never had any before,

307
00:35:07.513 --> 00:35:09.396
<i>but we tolerate anybody.</i>

308
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:12.459
Even the intolerable.

309
00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:15.248
Thank you.

310
00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:19.145
<i>That's just a statement of principle.
Nothing personal.</i>

311
00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:22.231
You see, we've got
a good place to wait here.

312
00:35:23.413 --> 00:35:27.042
And until now, no temptation.

313
00:35:32.054 --> 00:35:33.790
What are you waiting for?

314
00:35:45.283 --> 00:35:47.837
We're waiting for God to return...

315
00:35:49.002 --> 00:35:51.283
<i>and raise his servants to redemption.</i>

316
00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:58.088
<i>Dillon and the rest
of the alternative people...</i>

317
00:35:58.615 --> 00:36:02.625
<i>embraced religion, as it were,
about five years ago.</i>

318
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.372
<i>- Tincture?
- I'm on medication.</i>

319
00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.958
<i>- Hardly.
- What kind of religion?</i>

320
00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:14.464
<i>Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian,
Christian fundamentalist, uhâ€”</i>

321
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.925
<i>- Right</i>
- Exactly.

322
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.844
Point is, when the company
wanted to close the facility down,

323
00:36:19.928 --> 00:36:22.991
Dillon and the rest of the converts
wanted to stay.

324
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:27.811
And they were allowed
to remain as custodians...

325
00:36:27.894 --> 00:36:29.916
with two minders...

326
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:32.369
and a medical officer.

327
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:34.978
And here we are.

328
00:36:36.228 --> 00:36:38.113
How did you get
this wonderful assignment?

329
00:36:42.086 --> 00:36:43.401
How do you like
your new haircut?

330
00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:46.534
It's okay.

331
00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:07.976
Now that I've gone out on a limb
for you with Andrews,

332
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:11.312
<i>damaged my already less-than-perfect
relationship with that good man,</i>

333
00:37:12.185 --> 00:37:13.318
and briefed you...

334
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.740
on the humdrum history
of Fury 161,

335
00:37:18.045 --> 00:37:20.599
can you not tell me
what you were looking for in the girl?

336
00:37:20.717 --> 00:37:21.982
You attracted to me?

337
00:37:24.232 --> 00:37:25.493
In what way?

338
00:37:28.638 --> 00:37:29.943
In that way.

339
00:37:32.154 --> 00:37:33.514
Very direct.

340
00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:37.232
I've been out here a long time.

341
00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:41.490
So have I.

342
00:37:46.516 --> 00:37:51.603
<i>â™ª In the year 7510 â™ª</i>

343
00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:53.855
<i>â™ª If God's a-comin' â™ª</i>

344
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:57.609
<i>â™ª He oughta make it by then â™ª</i>

345
00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:01.279
<i>â™ª Maybe he'll look around and say â™ª</i>

346
00:38:01.362 --> 00:38:04.657
<i>â™ª Guess it's time for the Judgment â™ª</i>

347
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.562
<i>â™ª In the year â™ª</i>

348
00:38:40.252 --> 00:38:44.354
Hey, Spike.
Spike? Spikey!

349
00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:52.956
<i>Are you down there?
What are you doing?</i>

350
00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:39.762
I really appreciate your affections,

351
00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:44.966
but I am aware that they...
deflected my question.

352
00:39:47.192 --> 00:39:49.668
In the nicest possible way, of course.

353
00:39:54.051 --> 00:39:55.810
<i>You're spoiling the mood.</i>

354
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:58.645
I have a job to do.

355
00:40:00.223 --> 00:40:02.614
I just want to know why
we had to cremate the bodies.

356
00:40:02.973 --> 00:40:05.653
And now that I'm in your cot,

357
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.739
<i>you think I owe you an answer.</i>

358
00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:09.981
I think you owe me an answer.

359
00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:13.202
Being in my bed's
got nothing to do with it.

360
00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:20.004
<i>I had a terrible dream in hypersleep.</i>

361
00:40:21.627 --> 00:40:23.832
And I had to be sure what killed her.

362
00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:26.543
Anyway, I made a mistake.

363
00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:30.207
Possibly.

364
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:33.996
And now I've made another mistake.

365
00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.725
Really? What's that?

366
00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:37.816
<i>Fraternizing with a prisoner.</i>

367
00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:40.468
Physical contact.

368
00:40:41.663 --> 00:40:43.008
It's against the rules, isn't it?

369
00:40:43.406 --> 00:40:44.547
Definitely.

370
00:40:46.202 --> 00:40:47.476
When was this?

371
00:40:47.695 --> 00:40:49.351
I think you know.

372
00:40:55.283 --> 00:40:56.697
I'm not a prisoner.

373
00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:01.462
<i>You have a bar code
on the back of your head.</i>

374
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:08.373
That does deserve an explanation.

375
00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:12.834
But I don't think
now is the moment.

376
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:17.107
Sorry.

377
00:41:17.818 --> 00:41:19.974
We are rather spoiling
things, aren't we?

378
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.614
<i>Mr. Clemens.</i>

379
00:41:26.733 --> 00:41:27.834
Mr. Aaron.

380
00:41:28.068 --> 00:41:29.926
<i>Superintendent Andrews
would like you to report...</i>

381
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:32.834
<i>to vent shaft 22
on the second quadrantâ€” now.</i>

382
00:41:32.894 --> 00:41:35.927
<i>- We've had an accident.</i>
- Something serious?

383
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:40.639
<i>You could call it that.
One of our prisoners has been... diced.</i>

384
00:41:41.412 --> 00:41:44.373
Sorry. I have to go.

385
00:41:47.255 --> 00:41:49.257
Official duties.

386
00:42:18.022 --> 00:42:20.655
- Who was it?
- Murphy.

387
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.873
How do you know?

388
00:42:23.459 --> 00:42:25.116
That's his boot.

389
00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:30.256
I gave him the assignment, sir.
He was a wanker.

390
00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:32.758
No apologies, Mr. Aaron.
It wasn't your fault.

391
00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:46.731
Well, not much to say, is there?

392
00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.604
Death was instantaneous.

393
00:42:48.986 --> 00:42:49.859
No shit.

394
00:42:49.942 --> 00:42:51.986
I take it he was pulled
into the fan.

395
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:54.422
Sudden rush of air,
I'd imagine, exceptâ€”

396
00:42:54.447 --> 00:42:56.532
Right.
Almost happened to me once.

397
00:42:56.947 --> 00:43:00.995
<i>I've told him so many times,
"Stay away from the fans."</i>

398
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:02.997
<i>Nobody bloody listens.</i>

399
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.111
Except the fan was blowing.

400
00:43:13.267 --> 00:43:15.259
- What's that?
- I don't know.

401
00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:19.534
<i>I want to see you in my quarters
in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens.</i>

402
00:43:27.135 --> 00:43:28.522
Have you got any ideas?

403
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.154
<i>Here you are. You know,
wandering around without an escort...</i>

404
00:44:17.238 --> 00:44:19.736
is really gonna piss
Superintendent Andrews off.

405
00:44:21.338 --> 00:44:23.104
Will you tell me
about your accident?

406
00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:25.697
One of the prisoners has been killed.

407
00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:29.924
Really? How?

408
00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:31.283
In the air shaft.

409
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:34.880
Poor soul backed into a nine-foot fan.

410
00:44:36.048 --> 00:44:38.209
<i>I found something
at the accident site,</i>

411
00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:41.241
<i>just a bit away
from where it happened.</i>

412
00:44:41.931 --> 00:44:45.127
<i>A mark. A burn.</i>

413
00:44:47.595 --> 00:44:49.937
Rather like the one you found
on the girl's cryo-tube.

414
00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:57.381
Look.

415
00:44:57.975 --> 00:44:59.576
I'm on your side.

416
00:45:00.323 --> 00:45:03.826
I want to help, but I need to know
what's going on...

417
00:45:03.909 --> 00:45:06.014
or what you think is going on.

418
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.405
If you really wanna help,

419
00:45:11.335 --> 00:45:13.169
find me a computer
with audio capabilities...

420
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:15.093
so I can access this flight recorder.

421
00:45:15.166 --> 00:45:17.070
We don't have anything
like that here.

422
00:45:18.406 --> 00:45:19.884
- Well, what about Bishop?
- Bishop?

423
00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:21.562
The droid that crashed with me.

424
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:24.492
I can point you in the right direction.

425
00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:26.546
I can't join you.

426
00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:29.343
I have a previous engagement.

427
00:45:32.804 --> 00:45:35.733
This'll top you up.
Golic, don't fidget.

428
00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:40.696
What's all this shit?
It's not properly wrapped.

429
00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:42.907
- What the hell does he ever do right?
- Eat.

430
00:45:43.032 --> 00:45:45.326
- He's got that down pretty good.
- Golic!

431
00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:49.497
- You light a candle for Murphy.
- I'll light a thousand.

432
00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:53.554
<i>He was special.</i>

433
00:45:55.046 --> 00:45:56.679
<i>Never complained
about me once.</i>

434
00:45:57.963 --> 00:45:59.265
<i>I loved him.</i>

435
00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:04.773
Is it true what they say?

436
00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:08.134
His head split into a million pieces?

437
00:46:08.231 --> 00:46:10.942
Okay. Who's got the matches?

438
00:46:14.978 --> 00:46:17.736
- Sit down, Mr. Clemens.
- Thank you.

439
00:46:21.114 --> 00:46:22.822
- Sugar?
- No thanks.

440
00:46:22.947 --> 00:46:25.138
- Milk?
- Just a little, please.

441
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:30.809
Thank you, Mr. Aaron.

442
00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:43.259
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

443
00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:46.220
<i>You screw with me
one more time, I'll cut you in half.</i>

444
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.287
I'm sorry.
I don't think I understand.

445
00:46:49.324 --> 00:46:52.369
At 0700 hours, I received word
from the network.

446
00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:55.563
I may point out this is the first
high-level communication...

447
00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:59.157
this installation has ever received,
to my knowledge.

448
00:47:00.227 --> 00:47:01.735
They want this
woman looked after.

449
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:04.572
<i>- They consider her to be very high priority.</i>
- Why?

450
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:05.970
I have no idea.

451
00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:09.766
But why did you let her
out of the infirmary?

452
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:12.580
This accident with Murphy
is what happens...

453
00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:15.809
when one of these dumb sons of a bitches
walks around with a hard-on.

454
00:47:15.834 --> 00:47:17.967
I'm a doctor. You're the jailer.

455
00:47:20.212 --> 00:47:22.915
We both know
exactly what you are.

456
00:47:23.966 --> 00:47:27.094
- Sit down.
- I think it might be better if I left.

457
00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:30.608
I find you...
unpleasant to be around.

458
00:47:30.633 --> 00:47:33.272
You do? Isn't that lovely?
Consider this, Mr. Clemens.

459
00:47:34.435 --> 00:47:37.521
How would you like me to explain
your sordid history...

460
00:47:37.727 --> 00:47:39.532
to your newfound friend?

461
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.704
For her personal
edification, of course.

462
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.773
Now sit the hell down.

463
00:47:57.092 --> 00:48:00.169
I don't like you.
You're unpredictable.

464
00:48:00.374 --> 00:48:03.047
Insolent. Possibly dangerous.

465
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.678
You question everything!

466
00:48:06.139 --> 00:48:07.997
If I didn't need a medical officer,

467
00:48:08.022 --> 00:48:10.741
<i>I wouldn't let you within
light-years of this operation.</i>

468
00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:14.183
- I'm eternally grateful.
- Keep your sarcasms to yourself.

469
00:48:15.084 --> 00:48:18.341
<i>Now, is there anything I should know?</i>

470
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:22.107
- About what?
<i>- About the woman.</i>

471
00:48:22.191 --> 00:48:25.576
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens.
You spend every second you can with her.

472
00:48:25.966 --> 00:48:29.442
And I have my suspicions not all of
your concerns with her are medical.

473
00:48:33.702 --> 00:48:38.143
<i>Has she said anything to youâ€” anything
about where she's from, what her mission is?</i>

474
00:48:38.526 --> 00:48:40.682
<i>What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.?</i>

475
00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:43.712
She told me she was part of a combat unit
that came to grief.

476
00:48:43.885 --> 00:48:46.424
Beyond that, I assume it's all classified.

477
00:48:47.049 --> 00:48:48.910
I haven't pressed her for more.

478
00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:51.558
- That's all?
- That's all.

479
00:48:52.105 --> 00:48:53.699
- You're sure?
- Yes.

480
00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:56.410
- Nothing more?
- No.

481
00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:02.572
Get out of here.

482
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.509
Shut up, you fuckin' bitch!

483
00:50:54.596 --> 00:50:56.104
<i>- Get in there!</i>
- Shut up, you bitch!

484
00:50:56.884 --> 00:50:59.681
- Nobody's gonna hear you.
- Goddamn it, let go of me!

485
00:51:01.313 --> 00:51:03.145
Fuck you! No!

486
00:51:03.285 --> 00:51:04.730
Hold still!

487
00:51:06.967 --> 00:51:08.719
<i>No! Goddamn it!</i>

488
00:51:16.803 --> 00:51:18.110
You okay?

489
00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:21.571
<i>No! Son of a bitch!</i>

490
00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:32.381
Take off. I gotta reeducate
some of the brothers.

491
00:51:33.039 --> 00:51:35.300
<i>We've gotta discuss
some matters of the spirit.</i>

492
00:51:46.952 --> 00:51:48.954
<i>Cigarettes!</i>

493
00:52:05.748 --> 00:52:07.138
So let's do it.

494
00:52:13.781 --> 00:52:15.890
This is like 10 city blocks.

495
00:52:18.922 --> 00:52:20.101
How many?

496
00:52:20.828 --> 00:52:24.640
This makes 176.

497
00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.531
Can't you chew a little quieter?

498
00:52:27.853 --> 00:52:30.022
I'm trying to figure out
how big this compartment is.

499
00:52:30.707 --> 00:52:32.488
<i>I can't think with all this
goddamn noise you're making.</i>

500
00:52:32.513 --> 00:52:35.090
- You're not supposed to swear.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

501
00:52:36.638 --> 00:52:37.498
Now...

502
00:52:38.162 --> 00:52:39.779
we've encircled this
entire compartment onceâ€”

503
00:52:39.805 --> 00:52:41.287
- Hey.
- What?

504
00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:48.832
What the shit is doing that?

505
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:50.667
- Swearing.
- Shut up.

506
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:53.253
It's all right to say "shit."
It ain't against God.

507
00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:55.714
What the hell is going on
with the candles?

508
00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:02.778
Must be the wind from
one of the vent shafts.

509
00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:05.200
<i>Backwash from the closest
circulating unit.</i>

510
00:53:06.622 --> 00:53:08.977
<i>But if all the candles go out, how
the hell we gonna know where we are?</i>

511
00:53:09.061 --> 00:53:11.231
Somebody will just have to
go back and relight them.

512
00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.160
<i>I guess I'm nominated.</i>

513
00:53:26.206 --> 00:53:27.579
Watch your step, brother.

514
00:53:37.304 --> 00:53:40.070
Okay, who are the comedians?

515
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:28.432
Wait, wait, wait!

516
00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:30.684
- Quick, grab it. Here.
- Help me! Help me!

517
00:54:33.263 --> 00:54:35.145
Go! Fuckin' go!

518
00:54:37.925 --> 00:54:40.903
Go, go, go! Quick! Run!

519
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.697
Gimme that!

520
00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:34.755
<i>Get this fucking thing off me!</i>

521
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:36.750
Oh, fuck!

522
00:55:37.076 --> 00:55:38.505
<i>Let me go!</i>

523
00:56:37.072 --> 00:56:38.119
Hey.

524
00:56:40.185 --> 00:56:41.572
Ah, Ripley.

525
00:56:42.353 --> 00:56:43.361
<i>Hi, Bishop.</i>

526
00:56:44.307 --> 00:56:45.596
<i>How you feeling?</i>

527
00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.822
My legs hurt.

528
00:56:49.136 --> 00:56:50.532
Uh, listen, I'm sorry.

529
00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:52.816
It's okay.
I'm just a glorified toaster.

530
00:56:53.917 --> 00:56:55.287
How are you?

531
00:56:56.621 --> 00:56:58.623
I like your new haircut.

532
00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:01.475
Bishop, can you access data
on the flight recorder?

533
00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:02.787
No problem.

534
00:57:28.987 --> 00:57:30.307
<i>Golic?</i>

535
00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:39.456
- I'm home.
<i>- What happened on the</i> Sulaco?

536
00:57:40.214 --> 00:57:41.909
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?

537
00:57:42.472 --> 00:57:44.425
Stasis interrupted.

538
00:57:44.619 --> 00:57:47.816
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

539
00:57:48.155 --> 00:57:51.617
- Repeat. Fire in cryogenicâ€”
- What happened?

540
00:57:51.809 --> 00:57:53.862
What started the fire, Bishop?

541
00:57:55.421 --> 00:57:56.855
Can you hear me?

542
00:57:58.225 --> 00:57:59.870
The fire was electrical.

543
00:58:00.153 --> 00:58:03.245
It was in the subflooring.

544
00:58:03.647 --> 00:58:07.234
Did the sensors pick up anything
moving around on the ship prior to separation?

545
00:58:07.889 --> 00:58:10.936
I's very dark here, Ripley.
I'm not what I used to be.

546
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:14.350
<i>Just tell me. Does the recorder
indicate anything?</i>

547
00:58:15.224 --> 00:58:17.335
Was there an alien on board?

548
00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.081
Yes.

549
00:58:24.417 --> 00:58:28.026
Is it on the <i>Sulaco</i> or did it
come with us on the E.E.V.?

550
00:58:29.362 --> 00:58:31.627
It was with us all the way.

551
00:58:47.947 --> 00:58:49.400
Does the company know?

552
00:58:50.318 --> 00:58:52.783
The company knows everything
that happened on the ship.

553
00:58:53.573 --> 00:58:57.345
It all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to network.

554
00:58:58.267 --> 00:58:59.634
And they want it.

555
00:59:00.705 --> 00:59:05.417
I hurt. Do me a favor.
Disconnect me.

556
00:59:05.963 --> 00:59:09.588
I could be reworked,
but I'll never be top of the line again.

557
00:59:10.603 --> 00:59:12.340
I'd rather be nothing.

558
00:59:14.194 --> 00:59:15.355
You're sure?

559
00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:18.788
Do it for me, Ripley.

560
00:59:33.973 --> 00:59:37.028
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

561
00:59:38.824 --> 00:59:41.145
It wasâ€” It was the dragon.

562
00:59:41.465 --> 00:59:43.788
Feeds on minds. It wasâ€”

563
00:59:43.914 --> 00:59:46.249
- Nobody can stop it.
- What about Boggs and Rains?

564
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:48.660
They got s-slaughtered like pigs.

565
00:59:48.754 --> 00:59:50.418
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!

566
00:59:51.637 --> 00:59:53.231
Stark raving mad.

567
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:56.259
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault,
but he should have been chained up.

568
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:59.340
You called it, sir.
Mad as a fucking hatter.

569
00:59:59.747 --> 01:00:02.722
Keep him separated from the rest.
I don't want him causing a panic.

570
01:00:03.345 --> 01:00:05.513
<i>Clemens, sedate this poor idiot.</i>

571
01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.962
Not until we know about the brothers.

572
01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:11.907
Now, now. Pull yourself together.
Talk to me now.

573
01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:15.063
<i>- Now, where are Boggs and Rains?
- It wasn't me!</i>

574
01:00:15.124 --> 01:00:17.001
Hopeless. You're not gonna
get anything out of him.

575
01:00:17.118 --> 01:00:20.158
<i>- It wasn't me.
- We'll have to send out a search team.</i>

576
01:00:20.278 --> 01:00:22.174
<i>I'm afraid we'll have to assume
there's a very good chance...</i>

577
01:00:22.199 --> 01:00:24.233
this simple bastard
has murdered them.

578
01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.250
Now, you don't know that.

579
01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:32.093
He's never lied to me.

580
01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:36.341
He's crazy, he's a fool,
but he's not a liar.

581
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:39.939
<i>He's telling the truth.</i>

582
01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.932
I'd like to talk to him
about thisâ€” this dragon.

583
01:00:44.204 --> 01:00:46.977
- It was a dragon.
<i>- You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant.</i>

584
01:00:47.927 --> 01:00:49.615
<i>I'm not interested in your opinion,</i>

585
01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.085
because you are not
in full possession of the facts.

586
01:00:52.202 --> 01:00:56.304
This man is a convicted multiple murderer,
known for particularly brutal crimes.

587
01:00:56.632 --> 01:00:58.452
<i>Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?</i>

588
01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:01.507
<i>Yeah. That part's right.</i>

589
01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.329
Then I'll talk to you. It's important.

590
01:01:06.999 --> 01:01:08.832
<i>When I have finished
with my official duties,</i>

591
01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:12.088
I will be quite pleased
to have a little chat, yes?

592
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:21.803
<i>Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant.
It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,</i>

593
01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:25.701
with acid for blood,
and it arrived on your spaceship.

594
01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.990
<i>It kills on sight
and is generally unpleasant.</i>

595
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:32.477
And, of course, you expect me to accept
all this on your word.

596
01:01:32.907 --> 01:01:34.816
No, I don't expect anything.

597
01:01:35.063 --> 01:01:38.313
- Quite a story, Mr. Aaron.
- Right, sir. It's a beauty.

598
01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:42.309
- Never heard anything quite like it, sir.
- Expect not.

599
01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.951
Tell me, Lieutenant,
what would you suggest we do?

600
01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.074
Well, what kind
of weapons have you got?

601
01:01:50.144 --> 01:01:51.449
This is a prison.

602
01:01:51.629 --> 01:01:54.377
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners
access to firearms.

603
01:01:54.887 --> 01:01:56.254
What keeps them from killing you?

604
01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:58.738
Fear. There's no way to escape.

605
01:01:59.668 --> 01:02:03.215
With the arrival of the next supply ship,
the company would eliminate them.

606
01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:07.307
This is a maximum security prison,

607
01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:12.520
and you have no weapons of any kind?

608
01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:18.610
We have some carving knives in the abattoir.
A few more in the mess hall.

609
01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:22.113
Some fire axes scattered about the place.
Nothing terribly formidable.

610
01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:23.490
That's all?

611
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:25.707
We're on the honor system.

612
01:02:31.354 --> 01:02:35.566
- Then we're fucked.
- No, <i>you're</i> fucked.

613
01:02:36.202 --> 01:02:39.005
<i>Confined to the infirmary.
Quarantined.</i>

614
01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.788
Mr. Aaron will escort you.

615
01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:45.544
<i>I think you'll be safe from any large,
nasty beast while you're there, right?</i>

616
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.857
<i>Yes, that's a good girl.</i>

617
01:02:56.307 --> 01:02:58.024
<i>Let's all report to the mess hall.</i>

618
01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:01.697
<i>Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting.
Mess hall, right away, people.</i>

619
01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:06.282
Isn't there any way off of this place?
Some way to escape?

620
01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:09.996
No. Supply ship comes every six months.

621
01:03:10.715 --> 01:03:11.863
And that's it?

622
01:03:12.824 --> 01:03:14.051
Fuck.

623
01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.621
<i>They are sending somebody
to pick you up quite soon, I gather.</i>

624
01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:22.340
Really.
What's "soon"?

625
01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:26.897
I don't know. Nobody's ever been
in a hurry to get here before.

626
01:03:30.592 --> 01:03:32.983
Do you want to tell me
what you and Andrews talked about?

627
01:03:33.655 --> 01:03:34.811
No.

628
01:03:35.405 --> 01:03:36.967
You'll just say I'm crazy.

629
01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.022
That's a bit uncharitable.

630
01:03:49.319 --> 01:03:50.569
How are you feeling?

631
01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:53.334
Not so hot.

632
01:03:55.951 --> 01:03:56.912
Sore throat.

633
01:03:56.998 --> 01:04:00.366
Sick to my stomach.
Pissed off.

634
01:04:01.264 --> 01:04:03.600
Well, that's understandable
given the circumstances.

635
01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:07.770
<i>Perhaps I should give you
one of my special cocktails.</i>

636
01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.972
<i>I don't know why everybody
blames everybody for everything.</i>

637
01:04:11.295 --> 01:04:13.474
Nobody's perfect, only human.

638
01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.662
There's no such thing
as a perfect human.

639
01:04:19.084 --> 01:04:20.842
<i>In an insane world,</i>

640
01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:22.905
a sane man...

641
01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:28.239
must... appear... insane.

642
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:31.910
That's very profound, Golic.
Thank you.

643
01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:38.844
<i>You married?</i>

644
01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:43.016
- Me?
<i>- You should get married, have kids.</i>

645
01:04:43.804 --> 01:04:48.516
Pretty girl. I used to know
lots of 'em back home.

646
01:04:49.892 --> 01:04:51.173
They used to like me.

647
01:04:55.242 --> 01:04:56.634
For a while.

648
01:05:01.986 --> 01:05:03.533
You're gonna die too.

649
01:05:11.005 --> 01:05:14.333
<i>- Are you?</i>
- What?

650
01:05:15.622 --> 01:05:16.904
Married.

651
01:05:17.388 --> 01:05:18.615
<i>Why?</i>

652
01:05:20.396 --> 01:05:22.708
- Just curious.
- No.

653
01:05:25.819 --> 01:05:30.519
- How about leveling with me?
- Could you be more specific?

654
01:05:30.583 --> 01:05:33.802
When I asked how you got assigned here,
you avoided the question.

655
01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:38.059
And then when I asked about the prison I.D.
tattooed on the back of your head,

656
01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:40.019
<i>you ducked me again.</i>

657
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:45.191
It's a long, sad story...

658
01:05:47.481 --> 01:05:49.168
and more than
a little melodramatic.

659
01:05:49.402 --> 01:05:50.535
Try me.

660
01:05:53.691 --> 01:05:55.043
If you insist.

661
01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:01.957
After my student years,

662
01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:05.910
despite the fact that I had become...

663
01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:09.098
secretly addicted to morphine,

664
01:06:09.981 --> 01:06:11.809
I was considered
to be most promising,

665
01:06:12.418 --> 01:06:13.723
a man with a future.

666
01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:20.973
And during my first residency,
I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.

667
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.262
So, I went out and I got
more than a little drunk.

668
01:06:26.848 --> 01:06:28.363
Then I got called back.

669
01:06:29.121 --> 01:06:30.820
<i>Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,</i>

670
01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:33.519
<i>and there were 30 casualties.</i>

671
01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.658
<i>And 11 of them died.</i>

672
01:06:36.236 --> 01:06:37.424
Not as a result of the accident...

673
01:06:37.449 --> 01:06:40.244
but because I prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller.

674
01:06:43.497 --> 01:06:46.793
I got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3-C.

675
01:06:50.989 --> 01:06:52.633
At least I got off the morphine.

676
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.317
I'm sorry.

677
01:06:56.637 --> 01:06:58.489
I think I was let off lightly.

678
01:07:00.723 --> 01:07:02.231
Did you serve your time here?

679
01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.411
I got to know
this motley crew quite well.

680
01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.387
<i>So when they stayed,</i>

681
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:10.535
I stayed.

682
01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:14.614
Nobody else would employ me.

683
01:07:18.823 --> 01:07:21.788
<i>So, do you still trust me
with a needle?</i>

684
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.332
Magnificent.

685
01:08:57.717 --> 01:09:00.428
<i>Give us strength, O Lord, to endure.</i>

686
01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:05.057
We recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry God.

687
01:09:05.322 --> 01:09:09.017
<i>Let the circle be unbroken
until the day. Amen.</i>

688
01:09:09.369 --> 01:09:12.455
- Amen.
- What the fuck is happening here?

689
01:09:14.562 --> 01:09:17.773
What the fuck is this
bullshit that's comin' down?

690
01:09:18.273 --> 01:09:20.990
<i>We got murder. We got rape.
We got brothers in trouble.</i>

691
01:09:22.328 --> 01:09:25.797
I don't want no more bullshit
around here!

692
01:09:26.586 --> 01:09:29.722
Now, we got problems,
we stand together.

693
01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:31.527
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Dillon.

694
01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:33.402
All right.

695
01:09:33.706 --> 01:09:35.917
<i>Once again, this is rumor control.</i>

696
01:09:36.346 --> 01:09:37.636
Here are the facts.

697
01:09:39.167 --> 01:09:42.050
At 0800 hours,
prisoner Murphy,

698
01:09:42.128 --> 01:09:44.284
through carelessness on his part,

699
01:09:45.003 --> 01:09:47.394
was found dead in vent shaft 17.

700
01:09:47.972 --> 01:09:51.323
He seems to have been
sucked into a ventilator fan.

701
01:09:53.894 --> 01:09:56.442
At about 2100 hours,

702
01:09:56.917 --> 01:10:00.120
prisoner Golic reappeared
in a deranged state.

703
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:03.253
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing.

704
01:10:04.058 --> 01:10:07.816
There seems to be a good chance
that they have met with foul play...

705
01:10:08.034 --> 01:10:10.464
<i>at the hands of prisoner Golic.</i>

706
01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:15.920
We need to organize
and send out a search party.

707
01:10:17.067 --> 01:10:20.370
<i>Volunteers will be appreciated.</i>

708
01:10:23.308 --> 01:10:27.073
I think it's fair to say
that our smoothly running facility...

709
01:10:27.215 --> 01:10:29.925
has suddenly developed
a few problems.

710
01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:35.675
I can only hope we are able to all
pull together over the next few days...

711
01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.092
<i>until the rescue team arrives
for Lieutenant Ripley.</i>

712
01:10:39.456 --> 01:10:41.612
It's here! It got Clemens!

713
01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:45.408
- Stop this raving at once! Stop it!
- I'm telling you, it's here!

714
01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:48.411
Aaron, get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary!

715
01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:53.776
<i>Move it!</i>

716
01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.459
<i>Out of my way!</i>

717
01:11:00.643 --> 01:11:01.948
Fuck!

718
01:11:08.808 --> 01:11:11.371
<i>We give you thanks, O Lord.</i>

719
01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:16.856
<i>Your wrath has come,
and the time is near for us to be judged.</i>

720
01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:21.191
The apocalypse is upon us.

721
01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:27.338
Let us be ready.
Let your mercy be just.

722
01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.327
- It was massive.
<i>- Amen!</i>

723
01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.564
- And fast.
- I was there. I saw it.

724
01:11:32.978 --> 01:11:34.682
What the fuck do we do now?

725
01:11:35.439 --> 01:11:36.861
Who's in fucking charge?

726
01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.994
<i>Organize. We gotta organize, right?</i>

727
01:11:43.721 --> 01:11:45.424
Right. Well, I guess
I'm next in line.

728
01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:49.388
- 85's gonna be in charge. Jesus, give us a break!
- Don't call me that.

729
01:11:49.775 --> 01:11:51.857
Okay, look. There's no way
I can replace Andrews.

730
01:11:53.072 --> 01:11:55.032
He was a good man.
I know you guys didn't appreciate him.

731
01:11:55.057 --> 01:11:57.897
Aaron, we don't want
to hear that shit now.

732
01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.377
<i>Hey, sister, what about you?
You're an officer.</i>

733
01:12:00.576 --> 01:12:02.416
How about showing us
a little leadership?

734
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.330
<i>Forget fucking Shirley Temple.
You take charge.</i>

735
01:12:05.557 --> 01:12:07.175
- Right.
<i>- You run things here anyway.</i>

736
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.105
No fuckin' way.
I'm not the officer type.

737
01:12:13.972 --> 01:12:15.870
I just take care of my own.

738
01:12:15.956 --> 01:12:18.690
<i>Well, what does
this fucking beast want?</i>

739
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.089
Is this mother
gonna try for us all?

740
01:12:26.545 --> 01:12:29.053
- Yeah.
<i>- Well ain't that sweet?</i>

741
01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:30.787
So how are we gonna stop it?

742
01:12:35.287 --> 01:12:38.270
- We have no weapons. Is that correct?
- Right.

743
01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:42.066
I haven't seen one
exactly like this before.

744
01:12:42.818 --> 01:12:44.610
<i>Moves differently.</i>

745
01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.787
But the others
were afraid of fireâ€”

746
01:12:49.435 --> 01:12:50.888
Not much else.

747
01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:55.076
- Can we seal off this area?
- No chance.

748
01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.717
The installation's 10 miles square.

749
01:12:57.742 --> 01:13:00.131
<i>- There's 600 air ducts running to the surface.</i>
- What about video?

750
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.668
I see these closed-circuit monitors everywhere.
We could try to find it that way.

751
01:13:03.693 --> 01:13:05.857
The video system hasn't worked in years.

752
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:08.485
Nothing much works here.

753
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:10.678
<i>We got a lot of technology,
no way to fix it.</i>

754
01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:12.887
- What 85 is trying to tell you isâ€”
- Don't call me that!

755
01:13:12.912 --> 01:13:15.998
we ain't got no entertainment center,
no climate control,

756
01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:18.771
<i>no video system,
no surveillance,</i>

757
01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:22.606
no freezers, no fucking ice cream,

758
01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.076
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

759
01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.186
All we got here is shit!

760
01:13:28.115 --> 01:13:30.448
Oh, what the hell are we
even talking to her for?

761
01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:32.443
She's the one
that brought the fucker.

762
01:13:33.057 --> 01:13:36.936
Why don't we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall?

763
01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:39.592
That sounds good to me.

764
01:13:40.332 --> 01:13:41.787
<i>Hey, Morse.</i>

765
01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.382
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

766
01:13:55.096 --> 01:13:56.348
Right.

767
01:13:57.181 --> 01:13:58.361
Right.

768
01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:01.017
What are we going to do?

769
01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:16.090
What's this?

770
01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:20.456
That leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary.

771
01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.541
It's a ventilation shaft.

772
01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.961
Then we go in there, flush it out.

773
01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:29.450
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles and miles
of tunnel through there.

774
01:14:31.293 --> 01:14:32.809
It won't go far.

775
01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:35.567
It'll nest in this area.

776
01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:37.809
Right around...

777
01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:40.493
here.

778
01:14:41.329 --> 01:14:42.782
How do you know that?

779
01:14:44.345 --> 01:14:45.892
It's like a lion.

780
01:14:46.962 --> 01:14:48.673
It sticks close to the zebras.

781
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.570
Zebras? Oh, right.

782
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.579
But, look. Running around down here
in the darkâ€” Are you kidding?

783
01:14:54.884 --> 01:14:56.985
Once you get out of this main shaft,
there's no overheads.

784
01:14:57.055 --> 01:15:00.044
- Don't we have flashlights?
- We got thousands of 'em, but no batteries.

785
01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.423
- I told you, nothing works.
- Torches?

786
01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.462
Do we have the capacity
to make fire?

787
01:15:06.196 --> 01:15:09.421
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the Stone Age.

788
01:15:10.885 --> 01:15:12.495
No need to be sarcastic.

789
01:15:15.603 --> 01:15:19.213
Never been used. They were gonna
dump a lot of nuclear crap in there.

790
01:15:19.385 --> 01:15:21.587
<i>Never got around to it.
It's clean as a whistle inside.</i>

791
01:15:21.725 --> 01:15:24.186
This the only way in or out?

792
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:28.023
That's right. Walls are
six feet thick, solid steel.

793
01:15:28.327 --> 01:15:29.968
<i>Really knew how
to build these babies.</i>

794
01:15:30.046 --> 01:15:32.358
You're saying we get
something in there,

795
01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.178
there's no way it can get out?

796
01:15:35.304 --> 01:15:39.194
That's right. No fucking way.

797
01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.752
This is where we keep it.
I forget what the stuff's called.

798
01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:51.002
- Quinitricetyline.
- I knew that.

799
01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:55.229
Right. I've got to get these section
arrangements organized with Dillon...

800
01:15:55.254 --> 01:15:57.882
for the paintbrush, uhâ€”

801
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.135
- So, umâ€”
- David.

802
01:16:00.246 --> 01:16:03.611
- Yeah. You can get these drums organized.
- Right, 85.

803
01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:08.002
And... don't call me that.

804
01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:13.971
What's this "85" thing?

805
01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.885
Couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived.

806
01:16:18.005 --> 01:16:19.611
It's his I.Q.

807
01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:29.330
I saw a drum of this stuff...

808
01:16:29.608 --> 01:16:31.463
fall into a beachhead bunker once.

809
01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:34.807
The blast put a tug
in dry dock for 17 weeks.

810
01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:36.705
Great stuff!

811
01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:43.681
All right.
Let me get this straight.

812
01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:47.907
You want to burn it down
and out of the pipes,

813
01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.587
force it in here,
slam the door...

814
01:16:50.626 --> 01:16:53.556
- and trap its ass?
- Right.

815
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:57.488
And you want help
from us y-chromo boys, huh?

816
01:16:58.196 --> 01:16:59.704
You got something better to do?

817
01:16:59.837 --> 01:17:02.326
Why should we put our ass
on the line for you?

818
01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:04.578
<i>Your ass is already on the line.</i>

819
01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.288
The only question is...

820
01:17:07.071 --> 01:17:08.791
what are you gonna do about it?

821
01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:22.891
Look at this.

822
01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:26.259
There's only one of these fucking batteries
in 2,000 that works.

823
01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.500
- Hey, it could have been a lot worse.
- Yeah?

824
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.938
We might have got
the paintbrush detail.

825
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.862
Man, this stuff stinks.

826
01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:56.338
- This shit smells awful.
- Then don't breathe the fucking fumes.

827
01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:59.383
I'm in a fucking pipe with it.
How can I keep from breathing it!

828
01:17:59.505 --> 01:18:02.474
I mean,
don't breathe too hard.

829
01:18:02.654 --> 01:18:04.826
- You'll get high.
- That's good for me.

830
01:18:15.116 --> 01:18:16.476
So you miss Doc, right?

831
01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:21.304
What makes you say that?

832
01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:24.062
I thought you two got real close.

833
01:18:27.106 --> 01:18:29.312
I guess you've been looking
through some keyholes.

834
01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:31.663
That's what I thought.

835
01:18:39.618 --> 01:18:43.135
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

836
01:18:44.078 --> 01:18:48.117
Whatever you say, but...
you don't look okay to me, sister.

837
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:50.962
I'm fine.

838
01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:57.483
I hate this place.
I hate this place.

839
01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.055
Well.

840
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.462
There's definitely
something in here with us.

841
01:19:08.701 --> 01:19:10.746
Don't light the fire
until I give the signal.

842
01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.169
This is the signal.

843
01:19:13.732 --> 01:19:15.615
Got it?
Can you remember that?

844
01:19:22.292 --> 01:19:23.441
<i>Shit!</i>

845
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:25.863
Wait for the fucking signal!

846
01:20:34.422 --> 01:20:35.844
Get down!

847
01:20:40.938 --> 01:20:43.297
Come on, come on!
We gotta find the sprinklers!

848
01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.360
Come on!
We gotta help these guys!

849
01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:56.101
Come on! Move! Move!

850
01:20:57.728 --> 01:21:00.314
Go to the waste dump.
Don't open the doors!

851
01:22:02.949 --> 01:22:04.826
- Oh, God!
- It's all right.

852
01:22:05.065 --> 01:22:07.613
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
We got you.

853
01:22:09.933 --> 01:22:11.300
Fire's out.

854
01:22:22.177 --> 01:22:25.536
Junior! Junior!
Get those sprinklers and turn them on.

855
01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:28.646
We gotta get him out of here.

856
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.754
Come on.
We're walking you out.

857
01:22:45.191 --> 01:22:48.213
Junior! Behind you!

858
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:52.009
Open the door!

859
01:22:53.343 --> 01:22:55.011
Come on! Come on!

860
01:23:03.207 --> 01:23:05.897
Come on! Come on!

861
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.524
Come and get me, fucker!

862
01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.911
<i>Even for those who have fallen,</i>

863
01:24:44.435 --> 01:24:47.966
this is a time of rejoicing.

864
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:52.240
We salute their courage.

865
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:57.591
<i>They will live forever.</i>

866
01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:03.622
<i>Those that are dead are not dead.</i>

867
01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.661
They have moved up.

868
01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:10.801
<i>They have moved to a higher place.</i>

869
01:25:11.551 --> 01:25:12.926
Crazy bastards.

870
01:25:14.028 --> 01:25:16.106
Andrews used to call
them Dillon's God Squad.

871
01:25:16.684 --> 01:25:18.071
Keeps 'em out of mischief.

872
01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:21.958
- You're not the religious type.
- Me?

873
01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:24.302
Shit, no. I've got a job.

874
01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.552
<i>Look, uhâ€”</i>

875
01:25:28.972 --> 01:25:31.693
Figure the rescue team gets here in
four, five daysâ€”

876
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.365
six, tops.

877
01:25:34.337 --> 01:25:35.603
<i>They open the door,</i>

878
01:25:35.961 --> 01:25:39.040
go in there
with smart guns and kill it.

879
01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:44.947
- What have you heard from them?
- Nothing much.

880
01:25:45.595 --> 01:25:47.181
We got a message received.

881
01:25:48.908 --> 01:25:51.181
Later, we got something
that said you were top priority.

882
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:55.080
They don't cut us in on much.

883
01:25:55.223 --> 01:25:57.158
We're the ass end of
the totem pole out here.

884
01:25:58.970 --> 01:26:00.728
What if they don't want to kill it?

885
01:26:03.074 --> 01:26:05.136
- Take it back?
- Yeah.

886
01:26:06.534 --> 01:26:09.261
They're not lunatics, you know??
Gotta kill it.

887
01:26:11.511 --> 01:26:12.751
Right?

888
01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:22.404
<i>Morse, please, cut me loose.</i>

889
01:26:22.464 --> 01:26:24.045
No fucking way.

890
01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:26.139
Come on, man. It hurts.

891
01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:27.810
Oh, sorry.

892
01:26:29.381 --> 01:26:31.060
Come on. I haven't done nothing.

893
01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:36.039
- Just don't talk to me.
- Please, what did I do? Please.

894
01:26:36.117 --> 01:26:40.390
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna sit
here and guard your ass like I'm supposed to.

895
01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:42.554
I don't need any
fucking trouble with Dillon.

896
01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:47.410
All I did was tell 'em about the dragon,
what it did to Boggs and Rains.

897
01:26:48.156 --> 01:26:50.054
I didn't lie. You saw it.

898
01:26:51.547 --> 01:26:52.906
Fuckin' "A" I saw it.

899
01:26:53.648 --> 01:26:55.179
Oh, please.

900
01:26:55.867 --> 01:26:58.672
If this gets in here, I'm dead.
I can't run.

901
01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.799
I's not going to get in here.
We got it trapped.

902
01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:07.597
So what's the big deal?
Come on. Let me loose, man.

903
01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.888
Don't I always give
you cigarettes first?

904
01:27:13.107 --> 01:27:14.187
Yeah.

905
01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.060
Aren't I your friend?

906
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.154
I love you, Morse.

907
01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:24.810
Why not?

908
01:27:31.005 --> 01:27:33.331
But behave yourself.
No fucking around...

909
01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.826
or I'll get nothing but shit.

910
01:27:44.383 --> 01:27:47.519
- So where they got it?
- In the waste tank.

911
01:27:47.852 --> 01:27:50.876
We got that sucker nailed.
I mean, tight.

912
01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:54.001
Gotta see it again.

913
01:27:54.915 --> 01:27:56.470
What the fuck you talking about?

914
01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:02.025
No more cigarettes for you.

915
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.491
Right. We got the first part.
Now what do we say?

916
01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.162
Tell them we trapped it.

917
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:22.305
- What do we call it?
- A xenomorph.

918
01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:23.842
Right.

919
01:28:26.295 --> 01:28:27.537
How do you spell it?

920
01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:29.827
Here.

921
01:28:45.869 --> 01:28:47.299
<i>Hey, wait a minute.
We can't kill it.</i>

922
01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:49.032
- We don't have any weapons, right?
- Right.

923
01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:57.312
<i>See? That's all they ever tell us.
Treat us like shit.</i>

924
01:29:23.868 --> 01:29:26.569
- Off and on me now?
- What the hell you talking about?

925
01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:29.239
Talk to me, the beast.

926
01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:34.702
You can't go in there, dickhead.
The big motherfucker will eat you alive.

927
01:29:44.837 --> 01:29:46.673
Sorry.

928
01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:49.801
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

929
01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:17.036
Tell me what to do next.

930
01:30:46.409 --> 01:30:48.823
So, you're telling me they're coming to
take this thing away?

931
01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.206
<i>Yeah, they're gonna try.</i>

932
01:30:50.659 --> 01:30:52.003
They don't wanna kill it.

933
01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.581
We gotta figure out a way to do it
before they come here.

934
01:30:54.759 --> 01:30:58.804
Why do we have to kill it?
You just said the company's coming for it.

935
01:30:58.901 --> 01:31:01.596
That's right.
They wanna take it back.

936
01:31:02.143 --> 01:31:04.338
<i>- Some sort of weapon.</i>
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

937
01:31:04.705 --> 01:31:07.504
They can't control it.
They don't understand. It'll kill them all.

938
01:31:08.643 --> 01:31:10.478
Like I said,
what's wrong with that?

939
01:31:10.593 --> 01:31:14.930
<i>Nothing's wrong with that...
except a lot of innocent people will die.</i>

940
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:22.308
I thought you were
a religious man.

941
01:31:22.465 --> 01:31:23.980
You don't understand, do you?

942
01:31:27.551 --> 01:31:30.449
That world out there
doesn't exist for us anymore.

943
01:31:32.027 --> 01:31:34.105
We've got our own
little world out here.

944
01:31:34.352 --> 01:31:37.580
It ain't much, but it's ours.

945
01:31:39.275 --> 01:31:41.307
So fuck everybody else.

946
01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:43.221
No.

947
01:31:44.447 --> 01:31:45.463
Fuck <i>them.</i>

948
01:31:48.325 --> 01:31:50.411
- Hey, Dillon?
- Yeah?

949
01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:57.379
Uh, Dillon, we got
a teeny-weeny problem.

950
01:32:13.407 --> 01:32:15.298
<i>Fucking great!</i>

951
01:32:16.696 --> 01:32:20.034
<i>Miserable, crazy
son of a bitch let him loose.</i>

952
01:32:20.329 --> 01:32:22.087
<i>Got what he fucking deserved.</i>

953
01:32:23.728 --> 01:32:25.392
Well, now what are we gonna do?

954
01:32:26.821 --> 01:32:30.103
Andrews was right.
Should've kept the shithead chained up.

955
01:32:34.556 --> 01:32:35.939
- You okay?
- Piss on her.

956
01:32:36.212 --> 01:32:38.423
The fucking thing's
loose out there. What are we gonna do?

957
01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:39.696
I just said that.

958
01:32:40.595 --> 01:32:44.611
And you're the dumb prick that let Golic out.
You miserable little shit!

959
01:32:44.656 --> 01:32:46.366
Come on. Cut that shit out.

960
01:32:46.642 --> 01:32:48.931
<i>Tell your fucking bozo to shape up!</i>

961
01:32:50.787 --> 01:32:52.439
Wh-Wh-What do you think?

962
01:32:53.829 --> 01:32:55.653
I think I have to get to the E.E.V.

963
01:32:56.009 --> 01:32:59.946
- Why? What's up?
- I just have to use the neuroscanner.

964
01:33:01.492 --> 01:33:03.620
- You don't look so good.
- Who gives a shit how she looks?

965
01:33:03.710 --> 01:33:06.929
- What are we gonna do?
- Want a smack in the mouth, you stupid wanker?

966
01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.417
Shut the fuck up
and stop causing panic!

967
01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:12.962
Panicâ€” You're so fucking stupid, you
couldn't spell it. Don't talk to me about panic.

968
01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:15.465
- We ought to panic! We're fucking screwed!
- Whose fault is that?

969
01:33:15.548 --> 01:33:17.601
All right.
Now shut up, both of you!

970
01:33:19.515 --> 01:33:20.897
<i>Shut up!</i>

971
01:33:37.987 --> 01:33:41.157
- Well, I'm out of ideas!
- Oh, surprise me.

972
01:33:43.385 --> 01:33:45.791
- What about outside?
- Great idea.

973
01:33:45.916 --> 01:33:48.302
Sun don't come up for another
two days. It's 40 below zero.

974
01:33:48.327 --> 01:33:51.021
The rescue team's 10 hours away.
So that makes a lot of sense!

975
01:33:51.101 --> 01:33:54.438
Wonderful. You just want us to stay here
and let this thing have us for lunch!

976
01:33:54.919 --> 01:33:57.997
I want you to get everybody
that's still left together.

977
01:33:58.249 --> 01:34:00.982
<i>Get 'em into the assembly hall.</i>

978
01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:04.505
Okay.

979
01:34:08.747 --> 01:34:10.019
Where'd she go?

980
01:34:37.725 --> 01:34:39.335
Need any help?

981
01:34:41.741 --> 01:34:43.202
<i>I don't mean to scare you.</i>

982
01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:46.475
You shouldn't be
wandering around alone.

983
01:34:46.569 --> 01:34:50.171
Do me a favor and run
this keyboard, will you?

984
01:34:52.124 --> 01:34:53.374
Okay.

985
01:35:03.892 --> 01:35:06.103
- What do I do?
- Hit "B" or "C."

986
01:35:06.319 --> 01:35:07.690
What's "C"?

987
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:10.565
- "Display biofunctions."
- That's it.

988
01:35:14.728 --> 01:35:16.586
Okay, we're hot. Now what?

989
01:35:16.822 --> 01:35:18.439
<i>Let it run a cycle.</i>

990
01:35:20.033 --> 01:35:21.322
<i>It's real fuzzy.</i>

991
01:35:22.173 --> 01:35:23.462
Hit "enhancement."

992
01:35:43.881 --> 01:35:45.108
<i>Keep looking.</i>

993
01:35:52.718 --> 01:35:54.207
I don't know how
to read this stuff.

994
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:57.624
<i>Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch.</i>

995
01:36:04.318 --> 01:36:05.818
<i>Look for...</i>

996
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.971
<i>hairline fractures
through the base of the skull.</i>

997
01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:11.255
<i>Little white lines.</i>

998
01:36:20.475 --> 01:36:21.400
What is it?

999
01:36:23.499 --> 01:36:24.987
I think you've got
one inside of you.

1000
01:36:28.273 --> 01:36:29.867
That's not possible.

1001
01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:35.039
What does it look like?

1002
01:36:40.585 --> 01:36:43.264
- Horrible.
- I have to see it.

1003
01:36:46.514 --> 01:36:47.952
- Freeze it.
- You don't want to look at it.

1004
01:36:47.977 --> 01:36:49.288
Freeze it!

1005
01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:16.873
I'm sorry.

1006
01:37:22.545 --> 01:37:25.163
All right. The fucking thing is loose.
It's out there.

1007
01:37:25.923 --> 01:37:28.723
A rescue team is on its way
with guns and shit.

1008
01:37:29.088 --> 01:37:31.591
Right now there isn't
any place that's real safe.

1009
01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:35.266
<i>But we slay here,
in the assembly hall.</i>

1010
01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:38.153
This place never had
any fucking air conditioning.

1011
01:37:38.708 --> 01:37:40.730
If it comes in, it's gotta be through
one of these doors.

1012
01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:43.691
<i>Now we post a guard
to let us know if it's coming.</i>

1013
01:37:44.245 --> 01:37:46.465
<i>In the meantime,
you lay low,</i>

1014
01:37:46.825 --> 01:37:48.864
be ready and stay right...

1015
01:37:49.973 --> 01:37:51.449
in case your time comes.

1016
01:37:53.176 --> 01:37:55.739
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon.

1017
01:37:56.364 --> 01:37:58.364
We're gonna be
trapped in here like rats.

1018
01:37:58.426 --> 01:37:59.464
You got a weapon?

1019
01:37:59.754 --> 01:38:02.386
You got a blade? Then you
take it out and you fucking use it!

1020
01:38:02.418 --> 01:38:06.784
Oh, right. So you think we're gonna
stab this motherfucker to death?

1021
01:38:06.816 --> 01:38:08.808
No, I don't think shit!

1022
01:38:09.896 --> 01:38:10.831
Maybe.

1023
01:38:10.933 --> 01:38:13.220
<i>Maybe you'll hurt it
before it takes you out, huh?</i>

1024
01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:16.682
Isn't that something?
Any of you got any better ideas?

1025
01:38:21.992 --> 01:38:23.077
<i>And I'll tell you,</i>

1026
01:38:23.523 --> 01:38:26.484
until the rescue team
gets here, we're fucked!

1027
01:38:28.366 --> 01:38:29.577
<i>So you better get prepared.</i>

1028
01:38:38.496 --> 01:38:40.292
Well, I ain't staying here.

1029
01:38:43.425 --> 01:38:45.336
Well, then, suit yourself.

1030
01:38:52.574 --> 01:38:53.511
Fire.

1031
01:38:58.332 --> 01:38:59.191
Furnace.

1032
01:39:00.019 --> 01:39:02.812
Yeah.
Let's make it to the furnace.

1033
01:39:05.324 --> 01:39:06.832
Holy shit

1034
01:39:10.527 --> 01:39:11.904
Well, all right.

1035
01:39:12.191 --> 01:39:13.449
Fuckin' "A."

1036
01:39:14.156 --> 01:39:17.493
- Fuckin' "A."
- Too fuckin' right it's right.

1037
01:39:35.553 --> 01:39:38.849
It's up. What do you want to say?

1038
01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:42.560
Tell them the whole place
has gone toxic.

1039
01:39:43.498 --> 01:39:44.803
Are you kidding?

1040
01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:47.717
Then they won't come here.
The rescue team will turn back.

1041
01:39:47.935 --> 01:39:50.568
- Yeah. I know.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

1042
01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:53.068
Our only hope is that
they kill this fucker.

1043
01:39:54.287 --> 01:39:57.373
And maybe they can do something for you.
I don't know, freeze youâ€”

1044
01:39:57.398 --> 01:39:59.560
<i>They can do an operation.
They've got the technology.</i>

1045
01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:03.489
If this organism gets off the planet,
it'll kill everything.

1046
01:40:04.049 --> 01:40:06.162
The company doesn't care about that.

1047
01:40:06.396 --> 01:40:09.576
They just want it for
their bioweapons division, okay?

1048
01:40:09.818 --> 01:40:12.053
<i>So we can't let them come here.</i>

1049
01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:14.568
Fuck you.

1050
01:40:15.092 --> 01:40:19.346
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing
inside you, but I'm getting rescued.

1051
01:40:19.552 --> 01:40:22.857
I don't give a shit about these
stupid prisoners, but I've got a wife, a kid.

1052
01:40:22.933 --> 01:40:25.936
- I'll go home on the next rotation!
- I know. This is hard.

1053
01:40:26.263 --> 01:40:29.690
<i>I'm gonna send this message.
I need that fucking code.</i>

1054
01:40:29.774 --> 01:40:32.365
I'm sorry, babe. It's classified.

1055
01:40:32.404 --> 01:40:36.404
Listen, you stupid little shit!
This has got to be done, okay?

1056
01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.199
- There are no alternatives!
- No way!

1057
01:40:38.763 --> 01:40:41.368
You're not getting it!
No fucking way!

1058
01:40:47.773 --> 01:40:50.109
Look, it's nothing personal.

1059
01:40:50.804 --> 01:40:52.187
<i>Understand?</i>

1060
01:40:52.578 --> 01:40:53.781
I think you're okay.

1061
01:41:00.035 --> 01:41:01.457
Thanks.

1062
01:41:10.147 --> 01:41:11.670
Have you got any ideas?

1063
01:41:13.897 --> 01:41:15.467
It won't kill me.

1064
01:41:18.014 --> 01:41:20.178
I'm carrying the new queen.

1065
01:41:21.396 --> 01:41:23.217
It won't kill its future.

1066
01:41:23.889 --> 01:41:26.060
You really wanna bet this
thing's that smart?

1067
01:41:28.999 --> 01:41:30.131
Maybe I'll go find it.

1068
01:41:31.232 --> 01:41:32.912
See how smart it is.

1069
01:41:33.389 --> 01:41:35.920
- You're gonna go and look for it?
- Yeah.

1070
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:40.053
I have a pretty good idea
of where it is.

1071
01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:44.607
It's just down there... in the basement.

1072
01:41:45.545 --> 01:41:47.560
This whole place is a basement.

1073
01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.107
It's a metaphor.

1074
01:41:53.372 --> 01:41:54.623
Do you wanna come?

1075
01:41:57.662 --> 01:41:58.951
Fuck me.

1076
01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:24.448
Where are you when I need you?

1077
01:43:57.998 --> 01:43:59.400
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

1078
01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:03.404
I'm part of the family.

1079
01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.496
<i>You've been in my life so long,</i>

1080
01:45:13.766 --> 01:45:16.136
I can't remember anything else.

1081
01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:20.168
Now do something for me.

1082
01:45:22.524 --> 01:45:23.883
It's easy.

1083
01:45:24.568 --> 01:45:25.938
Justâ€”

1084
01:45:27.446 --> 01:45:29.438
Just do what you do.

1085
01:46:14.535 --> 01:46:15.761
It won't kill me.

1086
01:46:16.199 --> 01:46:18.495
What are you doing out here?
You're supposed to be laying low.

1087
01:46:18.558 --> 01:46:21.144
I have one inside of me.

1088
01:46:22.167 --> 01:46:23.794
Big one won't kill its own.

1089
01:46:25.206 --> 01:46:27.047
- What are you talking about?
- I just saw it,

1090
01:46:27.699 --> 01:46:29.050
an hour ago.

1091
01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:31.597
I stood right next to it.

1092
01:46:32.206 --> 01:46:35.620
I could've been lunch,
but it wouldn't touch me.

1093
01:46:36.431 --> 01:46:37.863
It ran away.

1094
01:46:39.925 --> 01:46:41.761
It knows I'm carrying its future.

1095
01:46:41.964 --> 01:46:43.058
Aw, bullshit.

1096
01:46:44.074 --> 01:46:45.425
How do you know
that thing's inside you?

1097
01:46:45.464 --> 01:46:48.722
I saw it... on the CAT scan.

1098
01:46:49.917 --> 01:46:53.605
It's a queenâ€” an egg layer.

1099
01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:56.535
It can make thousands more
like the one we've got here.

1100
01:46:57.183 --> 01:46:59.355
Still sounds like bullshit to me.

1101
01:47:01.472 --> 01:47:03.410
If that thing's inside you,
how'd it get there?

1102
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:07.339
I don't know.

1103
01:47:07.671 --> 01:47:10.090
When I was in hypersleep, I guess.

1104
01:47:10.706 --> 01:47:12.384
I was violated.

1105
01:47:14.136 --> 01:47:15.878
Now I get to be the mother.

1106
01:47:21.032 --> 01:47:23.032
I don't have much time,

1107
01:47:24.782 --> 01:47:27.357
and I can't do what I should.

1108
01:47:29.602 --> 01:47:31.820
I need you to help me.

1109
01:47:35.365 --> 01:47:37.450
I need you to kill me.

1110
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:41.646
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm dead anyway.

1111
01:47:42.427 --> 01:47:44.115
I can't survive it.

1112
01:47:45.876 --> 01:47:48.879
But the one inside of me
can generate thousands more,

1113
01:47:50.529 --> 01:47:52.482
can wipe out the whole universe.

1114
01:47:53.508 --> 01:47:54.896
It has to die.

1115
01:47:56.094 --> 01:47:58.357
So somebody's gotta kill <i>me.</i>

1116
01:48:01.458 --> 01:48:03.185
Are you up to it?

1117
01:48:04.427 --> 01:48:06.669
You don't have to worry about that.

1118
01:48:24.748 --> 01:48:26.412
No speeches.

1119
01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:31.583
No prayers.

1120
01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:06.206
- What's going on?
- I don't like losing a fight.

1121
01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:08.500
Not to nobody, not to nothing.

1122
01:49:08.625 --> 01:49:09.729
Fuck.

1123
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.146
That damn thing out there
has already killed half my men,

1124
01:49:13.171 --> 01:49:14.906
got the other half scared shitless.

1125
01:49:14.949 --> 01:49:18.585
As long as it's alive, sister,
you're not gonna save any universe.

1126
01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.991
You said you were gonna kill me.

1127
01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.978
- You fucking coward!
- I want that thing!

1128
01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:26.838
I want to get this thing,
and I need you to do it.

1129
01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:31.486
And if it won't kill you,
then maybe that helps us fight it.

1130
01:49:32.338 --> 01:49:34.392
Otherwise, fuck you!

1131
01:49:37.173 --> 01:49:39.114
Go kill yourself.

1132
01:49:44.461 --> 01:49:45.610
<i>Dillon.</i>

1133
01:49:47.399 --> 01:49:48.707
We waste this thing,

1134
01:49:50.422 --> 01:49:52.669
- then you take care of me.
- No problem.

1135
01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:57.079
Quick, easy and painless.

1136
01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:03.938
<i>This is the choice.</i>

1137
01:50:04.586 --> 01:50:08.356
<i>You die sitting here on your ass,
or you die out there.</i>

1138
01:50:08.419 --> 01:50:11.559
<i>At least we take a shot.
We owe it one.</i>

1139
01:50:12.614 --> 01:50:16.777
It's fucked us up.
Maybe we can get even for the others.

1140
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:20.781
- Now how do you want it?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1141
01:50:20.887 --> 01:50:23.515
I'm talkin' about killing
that big motherfucker.

1142
01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:24.609
<i>Hold it, hold it.</i>

1143
01:50:25.562 --> 01:50:26.828
The rescue team's on its way.

1144
01:50:27.999 --> 01:50:29.578
<i>We could just sit this out.</i>

1145
01:50:29.718 --> 01:50:33.043
<i>- Rescue team for whom?</i>
- For us.

1146
01:50:35.249 --> 01:50:37.921
They just want the beast.
You know that.

1147
01:50:37.992 --> 01:50:39.758
I don't give a damn
what they want.

1148
01:50:40.015 --> 01:50:42.010
They're not gonna
pick us off one by one, are they?

1149
01:50:42.859 --> 01:50:43.762
I wouldn't be so sure.

1150
01:50:44.195 --> 01:50:46.098
Come on.
They're gonna take us home.

1151
01:50:46.181 --> 01:50:47.474
They're not gonna take <i>us</i> home.

1152
01:50:47.936 --> 01:50:49.483
<i>Still doesn't mean we should
go out and fight it.</i>

1153
01:50:49.921 --> 01:50:53.320
- Jesus Christ! Give us a break!
- You guys have got to be fucking nuts!

1154
01:50:53.953 --> 01:50:56.316
- Look, I've got a wife and a kid.
- Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.

1155
01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.538
<i>You're not one of us.
You're not a believer.</i>

1156
01:50:58.812 --> 01:51:01.046
- You're a fucking company man!
- Yeah, okay.

1157
01:51:01.531 --> 01:51:04.335
Okay, I'm a company man
and not a fucking criminal.

1158
01:51:04.616 --> 01:51:06.656
<i>You keep telling me how dumb I am.</i>

1159
01:51:07.202 --> 01:51:09.413
Well, I'm smart enough not to have
a life sentence on this rock!

1160
01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:11.289
- Fuck you!
- Piss off, 85!

1161
01:51:12.148 --> 01:51:16.002
Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait for some
firepower to show up before we fight this thing!

1162
01:51:16.398 --> 01:51:17.492
<i>Right, Morse?</i>

1163
01:51:17.517 --> 01:51:20.549
Right. Okay. Just sit here
on your asses. Fine.

1164
01:51:20.843 --> 01:51:23.171
How about if I sit here on <i>my</i> ass?

1165
01:51:23.296 --> 01:51:24.367
No problem.

1166
01:51:25.146 --> 01:51:26.601
Oh, I forgot.

1167
01:51:27.055 --> 01:51:29.142
You're the guy that's
made a deal with God...

1168
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.158
<i>to live forever, huh?</i>

1169
01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:35.666
And all the rest of you pussies
can sit it out too.

1170
01:51:35.939 --> 01:51:38.088
Me and her'll do all the fighting.

1171
01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.775
<i>Okay. But I want
the same thing as you.</i>

1172
01:51:41.808 --> 01:51:45.498
I want to see it dead. I hate the fucker!
It killed my mates too!

1173
01:51:46.759 --> 01:51:50.120
<i>Why the fuck can't we wait for the company
and have some guns on our side?</i>

1174
01:51:50.593 --> 01:51:52.979
Why do we have to go on
some fucking suicide run?

1175
01:51:53.062 --> 01:51:53.849
Right.

1176
01:51:53.874 --> 01:51:55.459
Because they won't kill it.

1177
01:51:56.218 --> 01:51:59.087
<i>They might kill you just for having seen it.
But they're not gonna kill it.</i>

1178
01:51:59.171 --> 01:52:03.467
That is crazy! That is horseshit!
They will not kill us!

1179
01:52:05.969 --> 01:52:08.038
When they first
heard about this thing,

1180
01:52:08.842 --> 01:52:11.391
it was "crew expendable."

1181
01:52:12.233 --> 01:52:16.188
The next time they sent in marines.
They were expendable too.

1182
01:52:17.036 --> 01:52:20.108
What makes you think they're
gonna care about a bunch of lifers...

1183
01:52:20.192 --> 01:52:22.747
who found God at the ass end of space?

1184
01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:26.531
<i>You really think
they're going to let you...</i>

1185
01:52:26.615 --> 01:52:28.867
<i>interfere with their plans for this thing?</i>

1186
01:52:30.043 --> 01:52:32.629
They think we'reâ€” we're crud.

1187
01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:36.041
<i>And they don't give a fuck
about one friend of yours...</i>

1188
01:52:36.124 --> 01:52:38.335
that'sâ€” that's died.

1189
01:52:39.323 --> 01:52:40.170
Not one.

1190
01:52:44.597 --> 01:52:45.878
Have you got some sort of plan?

1191
01:52:45.925 --> 01:52:47.855
This is a lead works, isn't it?

1192
01:52:49.074 --> 01:52:52.925
All we got to do is lure
the fucking beast into the mold,

1193
01:52:53.683 --> 01:52:55.417
drown it in hot lead.

1194
01:52:56.222 --> 01:52:59.019
All right. So how do we do that?

1195
01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:02.192
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?

1196
01:53:08.908 --> 01:53:12.658
- Oh, fuck!
- We're all gonna die.

1197
01:53:13.411 --> 01:53:15.189
The only question is when.

1198
01:53:16.385 --> 01:53:20.043
This is as good a place as any...

1199
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:22.855
to take your first steps to heaven.

1200
01:53:23.597 --> 01:53:26.035
Only question is how you check out.

1201
01:53:27.988 --> 01:53:29.941
Do you want it on your feet...

1202
01:53:30.886 --> 01:53:34.891
or on your fucking knees, begging?

1203
01:53:35.519 --> 01:53:37.477
I ain't much for begging.

1204
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:39.620
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.

1205
01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.775
So I say fuck that thing!
Let's fight it!

1206
01:53:49.239 --> 01:53:52.242
Fuck it! Let's go for it!

1207
01:53:55.745 --> 01:53:59.356
<i>- Let's kick its fucking ass.
- What if it runs at us?</i>

1208
01:53:59.583 --> 01:54:02.085
<i>That's a fucking good idea.</i>

1209
01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:09.379
<i>Channel "A," Door 1 open.</i>

1210
01:54:09.528 --> 01:54:11.778
When was the last time
you used this place?

1211
01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:14.199
We fired it up five, six years ago.

1212
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:15.887
<i>You sure the piston's
gonna work?</i>

1213
01:54:16.141 --> 01:54:18.435
<i>There's nothing for sure
in this place.</i>

1214
01:54:22.887 --> 01:54:26.356
We trap it here first,
then you pull the lever, start the piston.

1215
01:54:26.473 --> 01:54:29.059
Then the piston's gonna push
the motherfucker right into the mold.

1216
01:54:29.098 --> 01:54:32.738
<i>Then one of the guys will pour the lead.
End of his ass. End of story.</i>

1217
01:54:32.856 --> 01:54:35.910
- What if somebody screws it up?
- We're fucked. You got one chance.

1218
01:54:35.994 --> 01:54:37.645
<i>One shot at it. That's all.</i>

1219
01:54:38.293 --> 01:54:42.926
We'll never have time to reset it.
Now remember, when you pull the lever,

1220
01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:46.754
<i>for a few seconds you're gonna be
trapped in here with that fuckin' thing.</i>

1221
01:54:47.496 --> 01:54:49.660
If you guys
don't drop the ball, I won't.

1222
01:54:49.895 --> 01:54:52.504
Well, you just better be right about
that thing not wanting you.

1223
01:54:52.848 --> 01:54:55.559
Because if it wants out,
that's how it's gonna go.

1224
01:54:55.770 --> 01:54:58.043
<i>Through that alcove, through you.</i>

1225
01:54:58.748 --> 01:55:01.251
<i>- Where are you gonna be?</i>
- I'll be around.

1226
01:55:02.043 --> 01:55:05.231
- What about the others? Where are they?
- Praying.

1227
01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:15.116
- You believe in this heaven shit?
- Eh? I don't know.

1228
01:55:15.296 --> 01:55:16.562
Me neither.

1229
01:55:19.413 --> 01:55:23.624
Fuck it, though.
What else have we got to believe in?

1230
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:26.523
<i>Say that for fucking sure.</i>

1231
01:55:29.339 --> 01:55:31.383
Wellâ€” Hey.

1232
01:55:33.134 --> 01:55:36.471

1233
01:55:53.948 --> 01:55:56.866

- What the fuck's he saying?

1238
01:56:26.896 --> 01:56:29.941
I think we'd better rethink this thing!

1239

- No, "E"!

02:08:37.847 --> 02:08:40.337
Bullshit! There's gonna be
10 tons of hot lead in there!

1357
02:08:40.607 --> 02:08:43.274
- I keep telling you, I want to die!
- We got a deal!

1358
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:46.184
Remember? It dies first, then you!

1359
02:08:46.252 --> 02:08:47.758
I'm not gonna move without you!

1360
02:08:47.827 --> 02:08:48.875
Now get going!

1361
02:09:05.296 --> 02:09:07.679
- Dillon!
- I've got to hold it here.

1362
02:09:07.882 --> 02:09:10.734
- What about me?
- God will take care of you now, sister!

1363
02:09:11.452 --> 02:09:12.620
No!

1364
02:09:13.366 --> 02:09:14.622
Pour the lead.

1365
02:09:22.475 --> 02:09:23.839
Fuck you.

1366
02:09:26.248 --> 02:09:31.084
<i>Go on! Pour it, Ripley! Go on! Damn it!</i>

1367
02:09:32.038 --> 02:09:34.266
Pour that lead, Ripley!
Pour it now!

1368
02:09:34.835 --> 02:09:36.702
<i>Come on! Come on!
That's all you've got?</i>

1369
02:09:36.741 --> 02:09:39.855
Is that all that you fight,
motherfucker! Come on!

1370
02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:42.983
Morse! Morse, over here!

1371
02:09:45.319 --> 02:09:47.863
- Ripley!
- Pour the lead!

1372
02:09:49.381 --> 02:09:51.492
Pour the lead!

1373
02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:52.660
Pour it!

1374
02:10:48.591 --> 02:10:50.092
I hate bugs!

1375
02:11:16.861 --> 02:11:19.538
<i>Ripley! It's burning hot!</i>

1376
02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:22.712
<i>Hit the sprinklers!</i>

1377
02:11:23.167 --> 02:11:25.628
<i>Douse the fucker!</i>

1378
02:11:58.972 --> 02:11:59.828
Gotcha!

1379
02:12:00.745 --> 02:12:02.581
<i>Yes!</i>

1380
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:11.275
- Don't come any closer.
- Wait. They're here to help.

1381
02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:12.901
Stay where you are!

1382
02:13:16.089 --> 02:13:18.698
- Ripley.
- Bishop.

1383
02:13:19.159 --> 02:13:21.910
- I'm here to help you.
<i>- No more bullshit.</i>

1384
02:13:22.886 --> 02:13:24.580
I just felt it move.

1385
02:13:24.663 --> 02:13:27.777
- You know who I am?
- You're a droid.

1386
02:13:27.855 --> 02:13:31.086
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.

1387
02:13:31.178 --> 02:13:34.706
No. I'm not the Bishop android.

1388
02:13:35.652 --> 02:13:37.128
<i>I designed it.</i>

1389
02:13:37.777 --> 02:13:39.284
I'm very human.

1390
02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:42.543
The company sent me here
to show you a friendly face,

1391
02:13:43.488 --> 02:13:45.746
<i>to demonstrate
how important you are to us,</i>

1392
02:13:47.191 --> 02:13:48.061
to me.

1393
02:13:48.543 --> 02:13:51.398
- You just want to take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.

1394
02:13:51.668 --> 02:13:55.986
- Bullshit.
- You're wrong. We want to help.

1395
02:13:56.734 --> 02:13:58.328
What does that mean?

1396
02:13:59.129 --> 02:14:03.300
- We're gonna take that out of you.
- And keep it.

1397
02:14:03.726 --> 02:14:07.289
Can't allow it to live.
Everything we know would be in jeopardy.

1398
02:14:10.133 --> 02:14:11.578
You don't want to take it back?

1399
02:14:11.797 --> 02:14:17.049
Ripley, time is important.
Let us deal with the malignancy.

1400
02:14:17.869 --> 02:14:20.846
<i>We've got a surgical bay
set up on the rescue ship.</i>

1401
02:14:22.330 --> 02:14:25.390
- Come with me.
- It's very quick.

1402
02:14:25.866 --> 02:14:30.514
Painless. A couple of incisions.
You'll be out for two hours.

1403
02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:35.275
And then it's over.

1404
02:14:40.656 --> 02:14:45.702
You still can have a life, childrenâ€”

1405
02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:50.281
<i>And most important,
you'll know it's dead.</i>

1406
02:14:50.765 --> 02:14:52.960
Let me help you.

1407
02:14:54.127 --> 02:14:56.095
What guarantee do I have...

1408
02:14:58.465 --> 02:15:02.761
once you've taken it out,
you'll destroy it?

1409
02:15:04.159 --> 02:15:05.639
You have to trust me.

1410
02:15:10.893 --> 02:15:14.060
Please? Trust me?

1411
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:19.706
No.

1412
02:15:31.239 --> 02:15:33.458
What's this gonna achieve?

1413
02:15:33.542 --> 02:15:36.461
- Stop!
- Oh, Jesus!

1414
02:15:39.173 --> 02:15:40.510
Morse.

1415
02:15:42.175 --> 02:15:43.672
Will you help me?

1416
02:15:44.838 --> 02:15:46.346
What do you want me to do?

1417
02:15:49.979 --> 02:15:52.894
<i>It was a mistake!
There was no need for any of it!</i>

1418
02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:54.271
Fucking android!

1419
02:16:13.249 --> 02:16:14.695
I'm not a droid!

1420
02:16:18.462 --> 02:16:22.924
Ripley, think of all
we could learn from it.

1421
02:16:23.743 --> 02:16:26.136
<i>It's the chance of a lifetime!</i>

1422
02:16:26.234 --> 02:16:31.239
You must let me have it!
It's a magnificent specimen!

1423
02:16:33.141 --> 02:16:34.978
Oh, Jesus!

1424
02:16:36.465 --> 02:16:38.106
No pictures!

1425
02:17:06.677 --> 02:17:08.419
You're crazy.

1426
02:17:10.512 --> 02:17:11.765
What are you doing?

1427
02:17:20.232 --> 02:17:22.609
No!

1428
02:18:22.878 --> 02:18:25.713
<i>- Come on, you. Get going.</i>
- Oh, fuck you!

1429
02:18:32.499 --> 02:18:36.266
<i>Ash, Captain Dallas are dead.</i>

1430
02:18:36.819 --> 02:18:40.145
<i>Cargo and ship destroyed.</i>

1431
02:18:40.671 --> 02:18:43.936
<i>I should reach the frontier
in about six weeks.</i>

1432
02:18:44.524 --> 02:18:47.374
<i>With a little luck,
the network will pick me up.</i>

1433
02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:50.280
<i>This is Ripley,</i>

1434
02:18:50.363 --> 02:18:52.253
<i>last survivor of the</i> Nostromo,

1435
02:18:53.828 --> 02:18:55.073
<i>signing off.</i>
