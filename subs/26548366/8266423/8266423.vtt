Hi, Barbie!

70
00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:53.128
Hi, Chelsea.

71
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:56.393
Hello, Dreamhouse.

72
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.742
Hello, Barbie.

73
00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.005
Two hot chocolates, please.

74
00:03:00.092 --> 00:03:02.137
You got it, Barbie!

75
00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:07.839
Whoa, cool!

76
00:03:10.102 --> 00:03:11.103
Yum!

77
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.254
I didn't know it could do that!

78
00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:14.062
With the new Smarthome app,

79
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.847
the Dreamhouse can do
just about anything.

80
00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:20.155
Anything?

81
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.031
Hello, Dreamhouse?

82
00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:27.685
Yes, Chelsea?

83
00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:30.427
Can you help me plan
an awesome party tomorrow?

84
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.907
Why, of course.
I'd be happy to help.

85
00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:35.345
Wait!

86
00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:40.088
I... um... I mean... party?
Why do we need a party?

87
00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:43.744
Is there something happening
tomorrow?

88
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:45.964
It's my birthday!

89
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.575
It's my birthday,
it's my birthday,

90
00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:51.709
it's my birthday, yeah!

91
00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:53.711
Really? Are you sure?

92
00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:56.366
I could have sworn
that was next week.

93
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.672
Nuh-uh.

94
00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.848
Hello, Dreamhouse.
When is my birthday?

95
00:04:00.935 --> 00:04:02.415
My calendar shows

96
00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:05.026
that tomorrow is,
in fact, your birthday.

97
00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:06.854
It's my birthday,
it's my birthday,

98
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.987
it's my birthday, yeah!

99
00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:10.815
It's my birth...

100
00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:12.338
Wait.

101
00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:15.298
You're up to something,
aren't you?

102
00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:23.871
I... have no idea
what you're talking about.

103
00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.873
I am not planning...

104
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.937
I mean, why would I be...

105
00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.878
Oh, thank goodness.
Hello, Dreamhouse.

106
00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:33.011
Show me who's
at the door, please.

107
00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.972
Barbie, Teresa, Renee!

108
00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:40.540
Oh! Quick, let's hide!

109
00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:42.890
Why are we hiding, exactly?

110
00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:44.936
You'll see. I've got an idea.

111
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:50.420
Hmm. That's weird.

112
00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:54.902
Uh, Barbie did tell us
to meet her here, right?

113
00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:57.078
Huh. It's on my calendar.

114
00:04:57.165 --> 00:04:59.733
Huh.

115
00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:04.869
Slumber...

116
00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:06.392
party?

117
00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:10.875
Wow.

118
00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:12.093
Love it!

119
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.661
- Cool!
- Ooh!

120
00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.663
A kaleidoscope of butterflies!

121
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.491
That's what you call
a group of butterflies,

122
00:05:18.578 --> 00:05:19.623
a kaleidoscope.

123
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.930
Ah! Beautiful.

124
00:05:23.017 --> 00:05:25.368
How is this possible?

125
00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:28.153
Hello!

126
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.198
Aah!

127
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.118
Your... your face...

128
00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:39.382
If only you could see yourself.

129
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.906
You were like... Whoa!

130
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:47.302
You got me good there, for sure.

131
00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:51.829
Ho-ho, we're gonna
get you for that!

132
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.312
- Come here!
- Look out!

133
00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:02.013
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course!

134
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:06.104
So... those butterflies?

135
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:08.149
Where did they go?

136
00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.369
And where did they come from?

137
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.373
It's all part of the magic
of the new Dreamhouse.

138
00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:20.379
I'm gonna get ya!

139
00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:25.297
Hello, Dreamhouse!
Activate chessboard.

140
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.219
Come here!

141
00:06:36.264 --> 00:06:38.310
Does Chelsea have any idea...

142
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:41.313
That you three are really here
to help me plan

143
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.837
the most epic surprise
birthday party ever tomorrow?

144
00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:46.318
She has no clue
what we're really up to.

145
00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:49.713
She thinks you're here for
a perfectly normal sleepover.

146
00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.982
So... what do you have
planned so far?

147
00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.333
I know she wants a carrot cake
with pink and white frosting,

148
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.336
and I've picked out decorations,

149
00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.033
but there's something missing.

150
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.340
I just can't put
my finger on it.

151
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:11.299
We can figure it out together.

152
00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:14.302
Stop her!

153
00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.609
Whaa...

154
00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:19.873
When did... she get... so fast?

155
00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:23.964
Hello, Dreamhouse.
Activate slide.

156
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:28.839
Oh! And ball pit.

157
00:07:29.404 --> 00:07:33.496
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

158
00:07:36.063 --> 00:07:37.325
Aah!

159
00:07:39.414 --> 00:07:41.329
Whoa!

160
00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:45.333
Whee!

161
00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:50.991
All right, this new
Smarthome app is pretty cool.

162
00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:52.993
"Pretty cool"?

163
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.994
Hello, Dreamhouse...

164
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.648
Up, please.

165
00:07:57.563 --> 00:07:59.130
What?!

166
00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:03.526
Whoo!

167
00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:19.019
Time for bed.

168
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.025
Doh moh go behbuh.

169
00:08:25.112 --> 00:08:26.679
Moh moh noh!

170
00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:30.030
Chelsea, finish
brushing your teeth first.

171
00:08:30.117 --> 00:08:31.031
In the bathroom.

172
00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:34.034
Nnh ghh buhroo!

173
00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:39.605
I don't want to go to bed yet.

174
00:08:39.692 --> 00:08:41.999
I'm having too much fun.

175
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:46.046
See? You're exhausted.

176
00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:49.049
Besides, the sooner
you get to sleep,

177
00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:52.270
the sooner it's your birthday!

178
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:55.055
All right.

179
00:08:55.142 --> 00:08:56.883
I guess I'm pretty tired.

180
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.762
Can we at least
do a story first?

181
00:09:05.849 --> 00:09:07.569
That's a great idea.

182
00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:09.200
What kind of story
do you want to hear?

183
00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:11.202
Hmm. I'm not sure.

184
00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:13.160
Why don't we make one up?

185
00:09:13.247 --> 00:09:14.205
Together.

186
00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:15.172
I love that.

187
00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:16.163
Genius!

188
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.470
Yay!

189
00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.733
Okay, Chels,
why don't you start?

190
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.561
Okay. Hmm.

191
00:09:22.648 --> 00:09:25.564
Once upon a time,
there were two mermaids.

192
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:27.871
Why don't we have
the Dreamhouse

193
00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.612
bring the story to life?

194
00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:31.222
Hello, Dreamhouse?

195
00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:33.311
Way ahead of you, Barbie.

196
00:09:38.838 --> 00:09:42.189
- Whoa!
- And they each had a pet...

197
00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:44.061
Sea turtle!

198
00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:45.845
No, octopi!

199
00:09:45.932 --> 00:09:50.720
Technically, the plural
of "octopus" is "octopuses".

200
00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:52.983
Really? That sounds funny.

201
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.245
I know, right?

202
00:09:54.332 --> 00:09:56.943
Okay. Pet octopuses.

203
00:09:59.642 --> 00:10:01.556
That's still not right.

204
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.429
- How about dolphins?
- Yeah!

205
00:10:08.781 --> 00:10:11.131
They loved playing
in the waves together.

206
00:10:11.218 --> 00:10:13.264
And exploring
the beautiful coral reefs

207
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:16.354
and discovering
new undersea flora and fauna.

208
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.231
Ooh! And they loved...

209
00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:26.233
dance parties!

210
00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.281
Yeah! Ballet dance parties.

211
00:10:30.368 --> 00:10:33.284
I love... I mean,
the mermaids love ballet

212
00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:35.286
because it's so graceful

213
00:10:35.373 --> 00:10:38.289
and it takes so much practice
to get right.

214
00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:41.292
One day, they were
so busy dancing

215
00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:43.294
that they didn't see

216
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:46.210
the Sea Dragon
was right behind them!

217
00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:53.304
The Sea Dragon!

218
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:55.262
Who wore a pearl necklace.

219
00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:01.312
She said sorry
for scaring the mermaids.

220
00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.400
She was just lonely,

221
00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:04.315
and she invited the mermaids

222
00:11:04.402 --> 00:11:05.838
over for a tea party.

223
00:11:05.925 --> 00:11:07.318
The mermaids
sipped underwater tea

224
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:08.449
with the Sea Dragon...

225
00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:13.106
and they all became
the best of friends.

226
00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:15.282
The end.

227
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:19.460
Best... story... ever.

228
00:11:19.547 --> 00:11:21.288
So imaginative.

229
00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:22.289
So fun.

230
00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:23.290
Magical.

231
00:11:23.377 --> 00:11:24.291
Thank you!

232
00:11:24.378 --> 00:11:25.728
Mm!

233
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:28.295
Mm...

234
00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:29.296
Time for bed.

235
00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:31.429
Okay.

236
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.435
Good night, Chelsea.

237
00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:38.958
Good night, everyone.

238
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:53.668
She's asleep. Finally.

239
00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:56.889
So, how can we help with
the surprise party tomorrow?

240
00:11:56.976 --> 00:11:58.369
I want to throw Chelsea

241
00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:01.372
the biggest and best
birthday ever.

242
00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:04.375
A birthday so special that...

243
00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:06.899
that we can't even
call it a birthday.

244
00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:08.205
What should we call it, then?

245
00:12:08.292 --> 00:12:10.381
A Dreamday.

246
00:12:10.468 --> 00:12:13.079
We should call it a Dreamday!

247
00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:14.733
I like it.

248
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.387
So, what have you
figured out so far?

249
00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:19.390
I've made a list
of everything we need to do,

250
00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:21.827
but... there's still
something missing.

251
00:12:21.914 --> 00:12:24.308
Something to bring it
all together.

252
00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:27.180
We need a theme!

253
00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:29.400
All good birthdays,
or Dreamdays,

254
00:12:29.487 --> 00:12:30.357
have a theme, right?

255
00:12:30.444 --> 00:12:31.532
That's it!

256
00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:33.534
Let's brainstorm party themes.

257
00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:35.406
Do you have any ideas?

258
00:12:35.493 --> 00:12:36.842
Excuse me, Barbie.

259
00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:39.062
I have a reminder set.
Time for bed.

260
00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:40.193
Oh, right.

261
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.673
You heard her story.

262
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.675
She loves ballet dance parties.

263
00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:46.417
How about a ballet-themed party?

264
00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:48.375
Hello, Dreamhouse.

265
00:12:48.462 --> 00:12:50.421

Dreamtime!

287
00:13:47.782 --> 00:13:51.482
Chelsea, like me, is also
very curious and imaginative.

288
00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:53.179
Remember the Sea Dragon?

289
00:13:53.266 --> 00:13:55.486
What if we had some
intellectual conversation

290
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:56.922
over a fancy tea party?

291
00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:58.619
Uh, hello?

292
00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:00.554
We're forgetting that
the whole story took place

293
00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:02.493
in the water and waves.

294
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.495
We should transform the pool

295
00:14:04.582 --> 00:14:07.193
into a beach paradise party.

296
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.021
I love these ideas!

297
00:14:09.108 --> 00:14:10.548
And we can't forget
the pet dolphins.

298
00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:12.895
Chelsea loves animals.

299
00:14:12.982 --> 00:14:15.506

So... which theme
do you think we should do?

332
00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:55.301
Hmm... I love them all so much.

333
00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:57.303
Aw...

334
00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.740
Let's do all of them!

335
00:16:08.314 --> 00:16:10.316
Mm...

336
00:16:11.404 --> 00:16:13.015
I'll see you later for...

337
00:16:13.102 --> 00:16:15.495
Don't want to keep
Mr. and Mrs. Roberts waiting.

338
00:16:15.582 --> 00:16:18.063
Have a great soccer practice!

339
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.325
Okay, I just...

340
00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.284
Bye, love you!

341
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:22.391
- But...
- Bye! See you later!

342
00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:23.329
Have fun! Bye!

343
00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:24.896
Goodb...

344
00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:28.117
Okay. No time to waste.
Let's get started.

345
00:16:28.204 --> 00:16:29.398
Brooklyn, you take
the living room.

346
00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:30.858
On it!

347
00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:32.401
Teresa gets the dining room,
and Renee...

348
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:35.341
I'll be out by the pool
making the magic happen.

349
00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:39.389
You are magic. Thank you.

350
00:16:39.476 --> 00:16:41.652
Hello, Dreamhouse.
Let's get started, shall we?

351
00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:44.394
Hello, Barbie.
How can I assist you?

352
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:47.919
We need to transform this room
into a ballet studio.

353
00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:52.271
Wow. Yes!

354
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.188
But we need mirrors.
Could you make the windows...

355
00:16:56.275 --> 00:16:57.537
Ah! Love it!

356
00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:02.151
Thank you, Barbie.

357
00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:03.456
Now, I need to change.

358
00:17:05.154 --> 00:17:06.372
Perfect.

359
00:17:11.899 --> 00:17:14.467
Hello, Dreamhouse?
We'll need a tea set.

360
00:17:14.554 --> 00:17:16.556
Of course, Barbie.

361
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.950
Ooh, yes.

362
00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:21.431
And on the tables,
can we get a delectable display

363
00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:24.477
of veggie tea sandwiches,
cupcakes, and fruit tarts?

364
00:17:24.564 --> 00:17:26.566
Absolutely.

365
00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:30.831
That is lovely!

366
00:17:33.704 --> 00:17:35.227
Hello, Dreamhouse.

367
00:17:35.314 --> 00:17:37.882
Can you please add
some floaties to the pool?

368
00:17:38.752 --> 00:17:42.408
Perfect. Okay, now,
can we add a couple cabanas

369
00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:45.237
there and there,

370
00:17:45.324 --> 00:17:46.891
and some lounge chairs?

371
00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:50.938
Awesome!

372
00:17:51.025 --> 00:17:53.767
Oh! And how about
a volleyball net over here?

373
00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:57.206
Oh! Thank you, Dreamhouse!

374
00:17:57.293 --> 00:17:59.251
This is so fun.

375
00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:01.427
Mm.

376
00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:02.950
Hello, Dreamhouse.

377
00:18:03.037 --> 00:18:05.257
Could I have a bunch
of puppies, please?

378
00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:06.432
Of course, Barbie.

379
00:18:08.739 --> 00:18:11.089
Aww!

380
00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:14.962
And some kittens too, please?

381
00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:23.449
Aw, thanks, Dreamhouse.

382
00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:24.450
No problem!

383
00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:31.936
Hmm...

384
00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:35.461
it just doesn't feel
Dreamday special enough.

385
00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:36.549
Hello, Dreamhouse?

386
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.595
Dreamhouse?

387
00:18:38.682 --> 00:18:40.292
How may I assist you, Barbie?

388
00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:41.467
Could we add bunnies?

389
00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.382
If you dream it...

390
00:18:43.469 --> 00:18:46.037
Oh, wait a second.

391
00:18:46.124 --> 00:18:47.908
Uh... Barbie?

392
00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:51.173
Could you make the animals
fun different colors, please?

393
00:18:54.611 --> 00:18:56.526
Aw! Perfect.

394
00:18:56.613 --> 00:18:58.373
Will you please
excuse me? Renee is calling.

395
00:18:58.397 --> 00:18:59.572
Thank you, Dreamhouse.

396
00:18:59.659 --> 00:19:01.487
Now, let's see how everyone else

397
00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:02.694
is doing with their parties.

398
00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:04.490
Wow.

399
00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:07.014
It's perfect, isn't it?

400
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.497
Yeah. But maybe...

401
00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:13.369
How about a disco ball
and a light show?

402
00:19:13.456 --> 00:19:14.761
Um...

403
00:19:14.848 --> 00:19:17.199
Hello, Dreamhouse.
Would you mind?

404
00:19:20.941 --> 00:19:24.423
Keep going. Make it magical.

405
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.515
- How's it going?
- Great!

406
00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.927
I'm brainstorming
all the cool things

407
00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:32.518
we can talk about with Chelsea.

408
00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:34.128
Should we contemplate
the vastness

409
00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:36.522
of the stars, space,
and the universe first,

410
00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:40.004
or the wondrous world of mold?

411
00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:42.354
Hmm...

412
00:19:42.441 --> 00:19:43.703
Huh, what am I thinking?

413
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.010
<i>Por supuesto,</i> it should be...

414
00:19:46.097 --> 00:19:47.533
Hello, Dreamhouse?

415
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.535
What are the differences
and similarities

416
00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:51.537
between llamas and alpacas?

417
00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:54.540
Uh, the average alpaca
weighs 150 pounds,

418
00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:57.543
whereas a llama can weigh
up to 400 pounds,

419
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.589
although both llamas and alpacas

420
00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:01.596
have a similar alarm call
when they sense danger.

421
00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:03.767
It sounds like this.

422
00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:14.560
Okay, thank you.
That was... informative.

423
00:20:14.647 --> 00:20:17.128
Oh, hey, Barbie,
what do you think?

424
00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:18.825
About llamas?

425
00:20:18.912 --> 00:20:20.653
The tea party!

426
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.177
Oh! It's fantastic.

427
00:20:23.265 --> 00:20:26.964
But... we need a centerpiece.
Hello, Dreamhouse?

428
00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:30.272
Can we get a giant cake
right here, please?

429
00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:32.361
Bigger!

430
00:20:33.318 --> 00:20:36.321
Bigger!

431
00:20:36.408 --> 00:20:38.280
That's perfect!

432
00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:42.936
Isn't this incredible?

433
00:20:43.023 --> 00:20:44.982
Yes, it is,

434
00:20:45.069 --> 00:20:46.984
but it can be
even more incredible.

435
00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:49.987
Hello, Dreamhouse...
add palm trees!

436
00:20:50.074 --> 00:20:51.815
You got it, Barbie.

437
00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:54.121
Awesome!

438
00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:56.472
And a waterslide!

439
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:59.431
Oh! Yes, yes, Barbie.

440
00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:01.912
It's... my pleasure.

441
00:21:03.653 --> 00:21:07.178
That... is... so... epic!

442
00:21:10.877 --> 00:21:13.619
Malibu, I think you should
stop for just a second.

443
00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:15.578
No time. Can't stop.
Chelsea will be back soon!

444
00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:17.580
We need to dream bigger.

445
00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:18.581
Hello, Dreamhouse!

446
00:21:18.668 --> 00:21:19.625
Add giraffes and zebras

447
00:21:19.712 --> 00:21:22.585
and... ...lions!

448
00:21:22.672 --> 00:21:23.760
Lions?!

449
00:21:23.847 --> 00:21:25.805
Right. Bad idea.
Scrap the lions.

450
00:21:25.892 --> 00:21:29.026
Dreamhouse, how about
we scrap all large animals...

451
00:21:29.113 --> 00:21:30.593
for safety.

452
00:21:31.637 --> 00:21:33.639
Okay, Dreamhouse,
let's get to work.

453
00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:36.207

A little t-trouble.

522
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.792
I-I... am... detecting an error.

523
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:12.972
Is that chlorinated pool water?

524
00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:15.235
What happened to my
Rosehip Peach Delight?

525
00:24:15.322 --> 00:24:16.367
Aah!

526
00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:24.070
Uh, Teresa, I think we found
your Rosehip Peach Delight.

527
00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:27.117
Oh, no.

528
00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:44.395
Oh...

529
00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:21.364
He-hello, Bar-bie...

530
00:25:21.388 --> 00:25:24.304
bie-bie-bie-bie... Hello.

531
00:25:24.391 --> 00:25:25.392
Wow.

532
00:25:25.479 --> 00:25:28.308
I am so sorry, Dreamhouse.

533
00:25:28.395 --> 00:25:29.309
I got carried away.

534
00:25:29.396 --> 00:25:31.355
You tried to warn me.

535
00:25:31.442 --> 00:25:34.488
Hey, I got caught up
in it all too.

536
00:25:34.576 --> 00:25:35.925
Oh, I should have realized

537
00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:37.412
we were overworking
the programming.

538
00:25:37.448 --> 00:25:39.319
Hello, Barbie.

539
00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:47.240
Man, we totally crashed
the poor Dreamhouse app.

540
00:25:47.327 --> 00:25:49.373
Now everything is ruined,

541
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.331
and Chelsea could be back
any minute!

542
00:25:51.418 --> 00:25:52.332
Let's not panic.

543
00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:53.333
It's not too bad.

544
00:26:05.432 --> 00:26:09.523
Okay, it's pretty bad,
but we got this!

545
00:26:09.611 --> 00:26:11.351
Like my Granny Vi always said,

546
00:26:11.438 --> 00:26:14.137
remember to K.I.S.S.

547
00:26:14.224 --> 00:26:15.617
"Keep It Simple, Silly."

548
00:26:15.704 --> 00:26:18.358
But I wanted things
to be perfect...

549
00:26:19.446 --> 00:26:21.405
not simple,

550
00:26:21.492 --> 00:26:23.363
and certainly not... this.

551
00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:35.288
You wanted things
to be special, not perfect.

552
00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:37.421
Simple can be special.

553
00:26:37.508 --> 00:26:39.249
Our hearts
were in the right place,

554
00:26:39.336 --> 00:26:42.426
but trying to make four
massive individual parties...

555
00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:44.428
Was way too complicated.
You're right.

556
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:47.387
I lost sight
of who this was all for...

557
00:26:47.474 --> 00:26:48.867
Chelsea.

558
00:26:48.954 --> 00:26:52.218
We just need to make
one unforgettable party.

559
00:26:52.305 --> 00:26:53.393
Exactly.

560
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.786
And we can still make

561
00:26:54.873 --> 00:26:56.396
an unforgettable Dreamday

562
00:26:56.483 --> 00:26:57.528
together!

563
00:26:57.615 --> 00:26:59.443
But instead of separate parties,

564
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.403
we'll have one beach, ballet,
tea party Dreamday!

565
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.405
With animal friends!

566
00:27:05.492 --> 00:27:08.060
Right. We can do this.

567
00:27:08.147 --> 00:27:09.409
If we work together.

568
00:27:09.496 --> 00:27:11.455
We got this!

569
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:14.850
I'll help the Dreamhouse
while you clean.

He-hello, Ba-Barbie...

620
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:27.678
bie-bie-bie-bie-bie.

621
00:29:36.687 --> 00:29:37.731
Hello, Barbie.

622
00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:39.603
I feel much better.

623
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.561
I needed some time to recharge.

624
00:29:42.736 --> 00:29:44.564
I am so sorry, Dreamhouse.

625
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:45.565
I got carried away.

626
00:29:45.652 --> 00:29:48.568
We were so not cool.

627
00:29:48.655 --> 00:29:50.266
I'm sorry too.

628
00:29:50.353 --> 00:29:51.615
I should have known better.

629
00:29:51.702 --> 00:29:53.573
We're all sorry, Dreamhouse.

630
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.184
We had too many ideas

631
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:57.577
that we tried to make happen
all together,

632
00:29:57.664 --> 00:29:58.752
all at once.

633
00:29:59.841 --> 00:30:01.538
Thank you.

634
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:03.322
Apologies accepted.

635
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:06.108
Do you think maybe
you have the energy

636
00:30:06.195 --> 00:30:07.805
to help plan a new party?

637
00:30:07.892 --> 00:30:10.939
But this time, we all
work together as a team...

638
00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:12.941
with you.

639
00:30:13.028 --> 00:30:14.856
I'll certainly try, Barbie.

640
00:30:14.943 --> 00:30:17.641
Okay, but you have
to promise me one thing.

641
00:30:17.728 --> 00:30:19.817
- Yes?
- Let us know

642
00:30:19.904 --> 00:30:21.775
if you're
getting too overwhelmed.

643
00:30:21.863 --> 00:30:23.647
And we'll make sure to consider

644
00:30:23.734 --> 00:30:26.606
how much we're asking you
to do this time.

645
00:30:26.693 --> 00:30:28.652
Oh, thank you, Barbie.

646
00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:30.784
I'll be sure to speak up
if I need help.

647
00:30:30.872 --> 00:30:33.657
Let's get to work!
Chelsea should be here soon.

648
00:30:33.744 --> 00:30:35.615
Okay, I think we should...

649
00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:52.458
Hello? Hello?

650
00:30:52.545 --> 00:30:53.764
Is anyone home?

651
00:30:57.724 --> 00:30:58.987
Barbie?

652
00:30:59.074 --> 00:31:00.640
Where's everyone else?

653
00:31:00.727 --> 00:31:01.641
I thought...

654
00:31:01.728 --> 00:31:02.816
I'm so sorry, Chelsea.

655
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:04.209
I... uh...

656
00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:06.646
kinda bungled
your birthday party.

657
00:31:06.733 --> 00:31:08.692
Oh.

658
00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:10.650
Let's go sit down,
and I'll explain.

659
00:31:23.446 --> 00:31:26.666
Surprise!

660
00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:33.673
Oh, wow.

661
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.024
It's amazing!

662
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:48.688
No! It's better than amazing.

663
00:31:48.775 --> 00:31:51.474
It's... splendorificious!

664
00:31:51.561 --> 00:31:53.780
Happy Dreamday, Chelsea.

665
00:31:53.867 --> 00:31:56.261
Happy Dreamday!

666
00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:04.008
Dreamday? What's a Dreamday?

667
00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:07.751
It means Barbie wanted

668
00:32:07.838 --> 00:32:09.753
to throw you
such a perfect birthday,

669
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.756
she almost broke the Dreamhouse
creating it.

670
00:32:12.843 --> 00:32:15.498
That's how much she loves you.

671
00:32:15.585 --> 00:32:17.587
It's like a birthday...

672
00:32:17.674 --> 00:32:20.024
But even more special.

673
00:32:20.111 --> 00:32:22.722
Ee! Thank you all so much!

674
00:32:22.809 --> 00:32:23.897
I love it.

675
00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:25.943
That includes you, Dreamhouse.

676
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.860
Aw. It truly is
my pleasure, Chelsea.

677
00:32:33.168 --> 00:32:35.561
Mm!

678
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:08.899
Whoa!

679
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:13.556
Look at her moves!

680
00:33:13.643 --> 00:33:14.992
Go, Chels! Go, Chels!

681
00:33:15.079 --> 00:33:16.776
I love it!

682
00:33:16.863 --> 00:33:17.908
I got you.

683
00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:26.482
So, you see,
there are projectors

684
00:33:26.569 --> 00:33:27.546
all around the Dreamhouse.

685
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:28.701
Using light

686
00:33:28.788 --> 00:33:30.616
and electromagnetic imagery,

687
00:33:30.703 --> 00:33:32.183
The Connected Dreamhouse

688
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.870
can create the illusion
of solid objects.

689
00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:40.931
Mm!

690
00:33:42.672 --> 00:33:44.587
So cool!

691
00:33:53.422 --> 00:33:54.597
I got it!

692
00:33:54.684 --> 00:33:55.902
Whoa!

693
00:33:58.383 --> 00:33:59.645
I don't got it.

694
00:34:00.385 --> 00:34:01.647
Oh...

695
00:34:01.734 --> 00:34:03.475
I'm impressed.

696
00:34:03.562 --> 00:34:04.650
You really almost had that.

697
00:34:04.737 --> 00:34:06.957
Even in ballet slippers.

698
00:34:08.698 --> 00:34:10.656
Oh, oops!

699
00:34:10.743 --> 00:34:12.745
Can we go again
after I change shoes?

700
00:34:21.754 --> 00:34:25.802
Okay, okay, enough!

701
00:34:26.803 --> 00:34:29.632
I guess there is such a thing
as too many doggie kisses.

702
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.896
Never!

703
00:34:55.571 --> 00:34:57.703
Ahh! Thank you.

704
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.444
This is all so amazing.

705
00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:02.708
You know, all I really need
for a special Dreamday

706
00:35:02.795 --> 00:35:04.232
is to spend it with all of you.

707
00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:06.756
You know what?

708
00:35:06.843 --> 00:35:10.716
I was so worried about
making everything perfect...

709
00:35:10.803 --> 00:35:13.458
but today wasn't perfect at all.

710
00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:15.721
You ate way too many sandwiches,

711
00:35:15.808 --> 00:35:17.245
fell on the floor,

712
00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:19.725
and were covered in drool.

713
00:35:19.812 --> 00:35:21.727
And I loved all of it,

714
00:35:21.814 --> 00:35:23.729
so I guess that means

715
00:35:23.816 --> 00:35:25.731
it's not about
getting things perfect.

716
00:35:25.818 --> 00:35:27.907
It's about how things
make you feel.

717
00:35:27.994 --> 00:35:30.693
The imperfections
make it memorable.

718
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.129
Make it special.

719
00:35:35.306 --> 00:35:36.829
Present time!

720
00:35:52.845 --> 00:35:54.934
Ooh. They're so pretty.

721
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:57.850
Thank you! I love butterflies.

722
00:35:57.937 --> 00:35:59.896
Ooh, one more thing.

723
00:35:59.983 --> 00:36:01.767
Hello, Dreamhouse.

724
00:36:01.854 --> 00:36:03.073
Activate wings!

725
00:36:06.859 --> 00:36:08.905
These wings actually work.

726
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.734
I...

727
00:36:11.821 --> 00:36:13.083
I can fly?!

728
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.780
Only inside the Dreamhouse.

729
00:36:14.867 --> 00:36:16.086
They won't work outside.

730
00:36:21.831 --> 00:36:23.615
Wow! Whee!

731
00:36:23.702 --> 00:36:24.877
Yeah!

732
00:36:29.404 --> 00:36:32.102
I love them. Thank you so much.

733
00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:33.799
Hello, Dreamhouse.

734
00:36:33.886 --> 00:36:35.192
Dim the lights, please.

735
00:36:35.279 --> 00:36:37.063
Of course, Barbie.

736
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.772
How am I going
to blow out those candles?

737
00:36:50.903 --> 00:36:52.862
Use your wings, silly.

738
00:36:52.949 --> 00:36:54.907
Oh, right.

739
00:36:57.997 --> 00:37:00.783
Hey! We need to sing first!

740
00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:03.916
Yeah!

741
00:37:06.745 --> 00:37:07.833
I know the birthday song,

742
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.793
but what's the Dreamday song?

743
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.664

Why is the pool pink...

and filled with lemons?

00:39:23.055 --> 00:39:24.927
And why is it delicious?
