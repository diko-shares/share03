2
00:06:49.703 --> 00:06:54.624
The food is terrible.
Worst shit I've ever seen, man.

3
00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:57.168
- <i>What you say?</i>
- You got any biscuits over there?

4
00:06:57.252 --> 00:06:59.587
<i>I keep seeing corn bread.</i>

5
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:04.801
- I am cold.
- Still with us, Brett?

6
00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:09.263
- Right.
- Oh, I feel dead.

7
00:07:09.348 --> 00:07:12.225
Anybody ever tell you
you look dead, man?

8
00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:17.146
<i>Oh, yeah, right.</i>

9
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:19.315
Now, I just forgot something, man.

10
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.359
Uh, before we dock,

11
00:07:21.443 --> 00:07:23.444
I think we oughta discuss
the bonus situation.

12
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.571
- Right.
- Brett and I, we think we oughta--

13
00:07:25.656 --> 00:07:28.032
- We deserve full shares, right, baby?
- You see, Mr. Parker and I

14
00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:31.744
feel that the bonus situation has
never been on an, an equitable level.

15
00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:35.081
Well, you'll get what you're
contracted for like everybody else.

16
00:07:35.207 --> 00:07:37.542
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.

17
00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:39.794
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.

18
00:07:39.878 --> 00:07:43.297
Huh? Yeah, I saw it.
Yellow light's for my eyes only.

19
00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:46.467
Okay, get dressed, huh?

20
00:07:46.593 --> 00:07:50.012
- Parker, come on.
- Can I finish my coffee? Thank you.

21
00:07:50.097 --> 00:07:52.157
It's the only thing good on this ship.

22
00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:42.398
<i>Morning, Mother.</i>

23
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.181
- Right.
- Okay.

24
00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:17.600
Plug us in.

25
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.570
Thank you.

26
00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:27.526
- Where's Earth?
- You should know.

27
00:09:27.611 --> 00:09:30.780
It's not our system.

28
00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:31.405
Scan.

29
00:09:34.826 --> 00:09:37.828
I can't believe this.

30
00:09:37.913 --> 00:09:40.665
Contact Traffic Control.

31
00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:45.628
<i>This is commercial towing vehicle</i>
Nostromo <i>out of the Solomons.</i>

32
00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:49.757
<i>Registration number,
1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner.</i>

33
00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:54.428
<i>Calling Antarctica Traffic Control.
Can you read me? Over.</i>

34
00:09:54.513 --> 00:09:57.765
<i>Commercial towing vehicle

35
00:09:57.849 --> 00:10:02.850
<i>registration number
1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner.

36
00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:06.200
- Nothing.
- <i>Keep trying.</i>

37
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:11.112
<i>Calling Antarctica Traffic Control.
Do you read me, Antarctica? Over.</i>

38
00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:15.741
I found it. Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.

39
00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:21.330
- We haven't reached the outer rim yet.
- That's hard to believe.

40
00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:24.459
<i>What the hell are we
doing out here?</i>

41
00:10:25.544 --> 00:10:28.295
I don't know. What the hell
are you talking about?

42
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.757
- That's not our system.
- I know that.

43
00:10:31.883 --> 00:10:35.970
<i>Listen, do you ever notice
how they never come down here?</i>

44
00:10:36.054 --> 00:10:38.180
<i>I mean, this is where
the work is, right?</i>

45
00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:40.933
<i>Well, it's the same damn reason
we get a half share to their one.</i>

46
00:10:41.018 --> 00:10:43.060
<i>Our time is their time.
That's the way they see it.</i>

47
00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:45.104
- <i>No, but--
- Listen, man. Same old shit, man.</i>

48
00:10:45.188 --> 00:10:47.314
<i>I think I know why they
don't come down here.</i>

49
00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:49.900
<i>It's because of you.
You don't have no personality.</i>

50
00:10:51.903 --> 00:10:54.697
<i>Wonder what they want now.
What's going on down here?</i>

51
00:10:57.367 --> 00:11:00.453
- Um, you happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?
- Yes, of course.

52
00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:03.197
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

53
00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:09.887
<i>What's happenin' now, baby?</i>

54
00:11:11.923 --> 00:11:16.135
Well... some of you may have
figured out we're not home yet.

55
00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:18.596
- We're only halfway there.
- What?

56
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.058
Mother's interrupted
the course of our journey.

57
00:11:22.142 --> 00:11:24.060
- Why?
- Yeah.

58
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.188
She's programmed to do that should
certain conditions arise. They have.

59
00:11:27.314 --> 00:11:30.316
- <i>Like what?</i>
- It seems she has...

60
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.610
intercepted a transmission
of unknown origin.

61
00:11:32.736 --> 00:11:35.946
- <i>She got us up to check it out.</i>
- A transmission? Out here?

62
00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:38.783
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- What kind of a transmission?

63
00:11:38.867 --> 00:11:42.495
Acoustical beacon. It repeats
at intervals of 12 seconds.

64
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:44.497
- S.O.S.?
- I don't know.

65
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:46.499
Human?

66
00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:49.460
- Unknown.
- <i>Well, so what?</i>

67
00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:51.670
<i>We are obligated under section 8--</i>

68
00:11:51.755 --> 00:11:54.048
I hate to bring this up, but, uh,

69
00:11:54.132 --> 00:11:56.467
this is a commercial ship,
not a rescue ship.

70
00:11:56.593 --> 00:12:00.012
- Right.
- And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty.

71
00:12:00.138 --> 00:12:04.016
And what about the money? If you wanna give
me some money to do it, I'll be happy to oblige.

72
00:12:04.142 --> 00:12:06.435
- The man's right.
- Let's go over the bonus situation.

73
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.439
- I'm sorry. Can I say something?
- <i>Let's talk about the bonus more.</i>

74
00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:13.150
There is a clause in the contract
which specifically states

75
00:12:13.235 --> 00:12:16.703
any systematized transmission indicating
a possible intelligent origin

76
00:12:16.805 --> 00:12:17.675
must be investigated.

77
00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:19.375
- <i>I don't wanna hear it.
- We don't know if it's intelligent.</i>

78
00:12:19.381 --> 00:12:20.449
<i>I wanna go home and party.</i>

79
00:12:20.534 --> 00:12:22.827
Parker, will you just listen to the man?!

80
00:12:25.038 --> 00:12:29.542
On penalty of total forfeiture of shares.
No money.

81
00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:32.503
You got that?

82
00:12:32.587 --> 00:12:36.340
- Well... yeah.
- All right, we're going in.

83
00:12:36.424 --> 00:12:38.342
Yeah. We're goin' in, aren't we?

84
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.017
Can we all hear that, Lambert?

85
00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:11.792
Good God.

86
00:13:11.877 --> 00:13:14.253
Doesn't sound like any
radio signal <i>I've</i> heard.

87
00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:16.547
Maybe it's a voice.
Well, we'll soon know.

88
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:18.716
Can you hone in on that?

89
00:13:19.843 --> 00:13:22.553
What was the, uh, position?

90
00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:26.432
<i>6-5-5-0... dash 9-9.</i>

91
00:13:31.229 --> 00:13:34.106
All right. I found the quadrant.

92
00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:38.027
<i>Ascension, 6 minutes, 20 seconds.</i>

93
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:42.698
<i>Declination... 39 degrees, 2 seconds.</i>

94
00:13:42.782 --> 00:13:44.950
Okay. Put that on the screen for me.

95
00:13:49.497 --> 00:13:51.332
<i>All right. Well, that's it.</i>

96
00:13:51.416 --> 00:13:54.835
It's a planetoid. 1200 kilometers.

97
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.863
- <i>It's tiny.
- Any rotation?</i>

98
00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:02.343
<i>About two hours.</i>

99
00:14:02.427 --> 00:14:03.862
What about gravity?

100
00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.323
Point eight-six.

101
00:14:09.517 --> 00:14:11.644
You can walk on it.

102
00:14:21.112 --> 00:14:24.540
<i>Approaching orbital apogee.</i>

103
00:14:24.824 --> 00:14:27.743
<i>Mark... twelve, eleven...</i>

104
00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:30.246
- Equatorial orbit nailed.
- <i>...ten...</i>

105
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.624
- <i>Main stabilizers in.</i>
- <i>...nine, eight seconds on descencion.</i>

106
00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:36.877
- <i>Grids energized. Fields focused.
- <i>...five, four...</i>

107
00:14:36.962 --> 00:14:40.172
...three, two, one.

108
00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:48.389
- D.O.R.'s on line.
- <i>How's the status on the lifters?</i>

109
00:14:48.473 --> 00:14:51.016
<i>Give me an A.C. pressure reading.</i>

110
00:14:57.524 --> 00:15:00.017
Forty-eight seconds and counting.

111
00:15:00.402 --> 00:15:02.745
<i>SR-1 stable.</i>

112
00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:05.531
Prepare to disengage from platform.

113
00:15:05.615 --> 00:15:10.411
<i>Mark. Twenty seconds.
Eighteen... seventeen... sixt--</i>

114
00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:14.890
<i>...twelve... eleven... ten...</i>

115
00:15:14.891 --> 00:15:18.059
<i>...nine... eight... seven...</i>

116
00:15:18.144 --> 00:15:21.255
<i>...six... five... four...</i>

117
00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:24.800
<i>...three... two... one... lock.</i>

118
00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:26.719
Disengage.

119
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.284
Umbilicus <i>clear.</i>

120
00:15:38.356 --> 00:15:40.808
Money's safe. Let's take her down.

121
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:48.449
- <i>Nine...eight...seven...
- Thrust.</i>

122
00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:51.327
<i>Roll 92 degrees port yaw.</i>

123
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:53.329
<i>Prime to port.</i>

124
00:16:13.842 --> 00:16:16.977
<i>Prime ventral.... prime dorsal.</i>

125
00:16:17.062 --> 00:16:18.520
<i>Down a degree.</i>

126
00:16:23.276 --> 00:16:25.493
<i>39,000 meters.</i>

127
00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:33.087
<i>Turbulence.</i>

128
00:16:42.128 --> 00:16:45.380
Locked and floating. You can drop us
anytime now. We'll catch you.

129
00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:49.302
All right, inertial damping's going off.
Hold on, people, there's gonna be a little bump.

130
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.424
<i>How's that pressure reading?

131
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.028
What the hell was <i>that?</i>

132
00:16:59.112 --> 00:17:01.772
Pressure drop in Intake 3.
Must've lost a shield.

133
00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:03.107
Let's go with it.

134
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:13.992
Dropping off now.

135
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.230
<i>Still dropping.</i>

136
00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:21.500
Here we are. We've got it.

137
00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:24.419
- Take her down.
- <i>Approaching thirty...</i>

138
00:17:30.943 --> 00:17:32.869
Navigation lights on.

139
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:44.106
<i>We've got 5-3 still out.
No problem. Just down 11%.</i>

140
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.075
<i>Grid status... okay.</i>

141
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.490
<i>Keep it coming! Keep it coming!</i>

142
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.275
<i>I need an income pressure reading.</i>

Kill drive engines.

149
00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:40.729
<i>What the hell happened?!</i>

150
00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.000
Somebody give me a straight answer!

151
00:18:45.184 --> 00:18:46.087
Is the hull breached?

152
00:18:46.287 --> 00:18:49.087
I don't see anything.
We've still got pressure.

153
00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:50.658
Hit the screen.

154
00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:52.758
Right.

155
00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:03.769
<i>The secondary load, sharing unit...

<i>Three to four cells are gone.</i>

158
00:19:11.444 --> 00:19:14.446
- <i>Is that it?
- No, hold on, uh...</i>

159
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.824
<i>We can't fix it out here anyway,
and, uh, we need to reroute</i>

160
00:19:17.951 --> 00:19:21.453
- <i>a couple of these ducts, wouldn't you say, Brett?</i>
- Dry dock time.

161
00:19:21.537 --> 00:19:23.872
Dry dock. Tell her we
need to dry dock.

162
00:19:23.957 --> 00:19:25.874
Look, we couldn't fix it
out here anyway.

163
00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:27.876
We gotta reroute all these ducts and,

164
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:30.587
in order to do that
we've got to dry dock.

165
00:19:30.672 --> 00:19:32.923
What else?

166
00:19:33.007 --> 00:19:34.925
<i>Some fragments kicked up, and</i>

167
00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:37.386
<i>we've got to clean it all out

168
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.846
<i>How long before we're functional?</i>

169
00:19:39.973 --> 00:19:44.393
- Look, what is...? What--
- It's 17 hours, tell her.

170
00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:47.312
- At least 25 hours.
- Yeah.

171
00:19:47.397 --> 00:19:49.773
<i>Get started on the floor panel.
I'll be right down.</i>

172
00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.900
What the hell's she comin' down here for?

173
00:19:51.985 --> 00:19:54.069
She better stay the fuck out of my way,
I'll tell you that.

174
00:19:54.153 --> 00:19:56.622
<i>I'd like to see what she's
gonna do when she gets here.</i>

175
00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:08.485
<i>Any response yet?</i>

176
00:20:08.585 --> 00:20:10.585
<i>No. Absolutely nothing.</i>

177
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.439
<i>Except the same transmission
every 12 seconds.</i>

178
00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:15.924
<i>All the other channels are dead.</i>

179
00:20:21.014 --> 00:20:24.016
Kick on the floods.

180
00:20:38.698 --> 00:20:42.034
- We can't go anywhere in this.
- Mmm.

181
00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:44.911
Well, Mother says the sun's
coming up in 20 minutes.

182
00:20:45.038 --> 00:20:48.373
- How far are we from the source of transmission?
- Uh, northeast.

183
00:20:48.458 --> 00:20:50.876
Just under 2,000 meters.

184
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.062
Walking distance?

185
00:20:53.546 --> 00:20:56.089
Well--

186
00:20:56.215 --> 00:20:59.343
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.

187
00:21:02.388 --> 00:21:04.389
<i>Oh.</i>

188
00:21:05.725 --> 00:21:07.809
It's almost primordial.

189
00:21:08.294 --> 00:21:09.895
<i>There's inert nitrogen,</i>

190
00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:12.847
<i>high concentration of
carbon dioxide crystals, methane.</i>

191
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.649
<i>I'm working on the trace elements.</i>

192
00:21:14.734 --> 00:21:16.860
- Anything else?
- Yes.

193
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.862
It's...

194
00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:21.323
Rock, lava base...

195
00:21:22.997 --> 00:21:25.085
<i>deep</i> cold, well below the line.

196
00:21:25.209 --> 00:21:26.529
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

197
00:21:27.413 --> 00:21:30.082
<i>I'll volunteer to be in
the first group to go out.</i>

198
00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.618
<i>Yeah, that figures.</i>

199
00:21:33.002 --> 00:21:34.396
<i>You too, Lambert.</i>

200
00:21:35.922 --> 00:21:36.724
Swell.

201
00:21:37.424 --> 00:21:38.824
<i>Better break out the weapons.</i>

202
00:22:53.849 --> 00:22:56.418
<i>I can't see a goddamn thing!</i>

203
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.921
<i>Ash, are you receiving?</i>

204
00:23:04.719 --> 00:23:07.012
<i>Good contact on my board.</i>

205
00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:11.349
<i>Clear and free.
Keep the line open... let's go.</i>

206
00:23:25.698 --> 00:23:26.533
Hey, Ripley.

207
00:23:28.618 --> 00:23:30.702
Hey, Ripley, I wanna ask you a question.

208
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.154
If they find what they're lookin' for out there,
does that mean we get full shares?

209
00:23:36.158 --> 00:23:40.212
Don't worry, Parker, yeah.
You'll get whatever's coming to you.

210
00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:42.839
Look, I'm not gonna do
any more work...

211
00:23:42.924 --> 00:23:45.842
- till we get this straightened out.
- <i>Brett,</i>

212
00:23:45.968 --> 00:23:49.554
- you're guaranteed by law to get a share.
- <i>What?</i>

213
00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:52.807
- Why don't you just fuck off.
- What?

214
00:23:53.392 --> 00:23:55.310
<i>What'd you say, Rip?</i>

215
00:23:55.394 --> 00:23:59.064
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.

216
00:24:00.483 --> 00:24:02.993
<i>Hey, Ripley, come back here!</i>

217
00:24:08.157 --> 00:24:11.159
- Son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

218
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.880
<i>Can't see a goddamn thing.</i>

219
00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:26.716
- <i>Quit griping.
- I like griping.</i>

220
00:24:26.801 --> 00:24:28.743
<i>Come on. Knock it off!</i>

221
00:25:53.628 --> 00:25:55.146
<i>Ash, can you see this?</i>

222
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.240
Yes, I can.

223
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:01.928
I've never seen anything like it.

224
00:26:11.797 --> 00:26:13.657
<i>Very bizarre.</i>

225
00:26:16.952 --> 00:26:18.795
<i>You said it.</i>

226
00:26:27.672 --> 00:26:30.048
<i>All right...</i>

227
00:26:30.132 --> 00:26:32.834
<i>Moving on to second...
position.</i>

228
00:26:33.018 --> 00:26:34.045
<i>What is it?</i>

229
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:38.840
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

230
00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:41.893
<i>We've got this far.
We must go on!</i>

231
00:26:41.977 --> 00:26:43.637
<i>We have to go on!</i>

232
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:48.760
Will you say that again?

233
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.060
Shit.

234
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:56.116
<i>Ash, as you can see,
it's kind of hard to describe.</i>

235
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.910
I'm going back to the console.

236
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:16.052
<i>Seems to be solid.</i>

237
00:27:16.137 --> 00:27:18.722
<i>To walk... You can on it.</i>

238
00:27:46.266 --> 00:27:47.410
Dallas?

239
00:28:40.304 --> 00:28:42.514
<i>Come on down here.
Something different down here.</i>

240
00:28:43.974 --> 00:28:46.392
I don't know what it is, but...

241
00:28:46.477 --> 00:28:49.854
See if we can get up that wall.
If we can get up that wall, we can find out.

242
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.961
<i>Amazing.</i>

243
00:29:58.265 --> 00:30:00.333
<i>Alien life form.</i>

244
00:30:02.386 --> 00:30:04.796
<i>Looks like it's been dead a long time.</i>

245
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.599
<i>Fossilized.</i>

246
00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:11.069
<i>Looks like it's grown out of the chair.</i>

247
00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:19.655
<i>Oh.</i>

248
00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:23.781
<i>Bones are bent outward...</i>

249
00:30:23.866 --> 00:30:26.910
<i>like he exploded from inside.</i>

250
00:30:28.829 --> 00:30:31.164
<i>Wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.</i>

251
00:30:36.544 --> 00:30:38.530
<i>Let's get the hell out of here.</i>

252
00:30:50.768 --> 00:30:53.889
<i>Hey, Dallas...
Lambert, come on over here.</i>

253
00:30:57.024 --> 00:30:58.401
<i>Come on.</i>

254
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.704
- <i>What do you got?
- See what you make of this.</i>

255
00:31:13.582 --> 00:31:15.500
Ash.

256
00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:19.073
<i>That transmission...
Mother's deciphered part of it.</i>

257
00:31:19.088 --> 00:31:21.547
- <i>It doesn't look like an S.O.S.</i>
- Well, what is it, then?

258
00:31:21.632 --> 00:31:24.768
Well, I--
It looks like a warning.

259
00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:27.637
- <i>I'm gonna go out after them.</i>
- What's the point?

260
00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:33.388
I mean, by the t-time it
takes to get there, you'll,

261
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.770
<i>they'll know if it's
a warning or not, yes?</i>

262
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.383
<i>You okay down there?</i>

263
00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.982
- <i>Can you see anything?
- I dunno... a cave.</i>

264
00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:16.894
<i>A ca-- a cave of some sort.
But I...</i>

265
00:32:19.064 --> 00:32:21.858
<i>Well, I don't know, but it's like
the goddamn tropics in here.</i>

266
00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:27.121
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

267
00:32:54.892 --> 00:32:57.852
<i>The cave is completely enclosed...</i>

268
00:32:57.936 --> 00:33:00.313
<i>and it's full of...</i>

269
00:33:00.397 --> 00:33:04.033
<i>leathery objects, like...
eggs or something.</i>

270
00:33:22.344 --> 00:33:24.504
<i>There's a-a layer of mist...</i>

271
00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:28.633
<i>just covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.</i>

272
00:33:31.804 --> 00:33:34.764
<i>Kane? You all right?</i>

273
00:33:34.848 --> 00:33:37.391
<i>Yeah, I'm okay. All right.</i>

274
00:33:39.603 --> 00:33:41.371
<i>I'm okay. I just slipped.</i>

275
00:34:02.267 --> 00:34:04.877
Appears to be completely sealed.

276
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.223
<i>Wait a minute, there's movement.</i>

277
00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:47.070
<i>It seems to have life...
organic life.

278
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.528
<i>- You there, Ripley?</i>
- I'm right here.

279
00:36:01.203 --> 00:36:03.321
Okay, Ripley, I'm at the
inner lock hatch now.

280
00:36:03.321 --> 00:36:04.321
<i>Right.</i>

281
00:36:13.966 --> 00:36:15.717
<i>- Okay, Ripley.
- Right here.</i>

282
00:36:15.717 --> 00:36:16.717
<i>We're clean. Let us in.</i>

283
00:36:16.802 --> 00:36:19.453
- What happened to Kane?
- Something has attached itself to him.

284
00:36:19.478 --> 00:36:21.402
We have to get him to
the infirmary right away.

285
00:36:21.482 --> 00:36:23.502
What kind of "thing"?
I need a clear definition.

286
00:36:23.508 --> 00:36:25.609
An organism. Open the hatch!

287
00:36:25.644 --> 00:36:28.262
Wait a minute. If we let it in,
the ship could be infected.

288
00:36:28.296 --> 00:36:31.941
You know the quarantine procedure.
24 hours for decontamination.

289
00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.901
He could die in 24 hours.
Open the hatch!

290
00:36:33.986 --> 00:36:36.821
Listen to me. If we break
quarantine, we could all die.

291
00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:40.984
<i>Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside!</i>

292
00:36:43.161 --> 00:36:44.829
No. I can't do that.

293
00:36:44.913 --> 00:36:47.031
<i>And if you were in my position,
you'd do the same.</i>

294
00:36:47.096 --> 00:36:49.292
Ripley, this is an order!
Open that hatch right now, do you hear me?

295
00:36:49.818 --> 00:36:51.294
<i>Yes.</i>

296
00:36:51.378 --> 00:36:53.421
<i>Ripley, this is an order!
Do you hear me?</i>

297
00:36:53.505 --> 00:36:57.100
Yes, I read you.
The answer is negative.

298
00:36:59.786 --> 00:37:01.045
Inner hatch opened.

299
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.842
My God.

300
00:37:41.178 --> 00:37:43.062
What the hell is that?

301
00:37:44.556 --> 00:37:47.933
Jesus... Christ.

302
00:37:49.895 --> 00:37:52.188
What is that, man?

303
00:37:53.982 --> 00:37:56.317
Hey, how the hell is he breathing?

304
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:58.019
Is he still alive or what?

305
00:37:58.403 --> 00:38:01.363
And why don't you guys freeze him?

306
00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:03.149
How come they don't freeze him?

307
00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:05.493
W-what's going on in there?

308
00:38:05.577 --> 00:38:07.912
- What the fuck is going on?
- You bitch!

309
00:38:07.996 --> 00:38:10.456
Jesus Christ!
Hey! Hey!

310
00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.792
- You would've left us out there.
- Break it up.

311
00:38:12.876 --> 00:38:17.379
<i>All right. Ripley, when I give
an order, I expect to be obeyed.</i>

312
00:38:17.464 --> 00:38:20.966
- Even if it's against the law?
- <i>You're goddamn right!</i>

313
00:38:21.051 --> 00:38:23.904
Well, maybe she has a point, you know.
Who the hell knows what that thing is.

314
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:26.722
How are we gonna get that off him?

315
00:38:26.848 --> 00:38:30.267
- How are we gonna get it off?
- I'm gonna get some instruments.

316
00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:36.232
My God.

317
00:38:38.735 --> 00:38:42.488
Right.
I'll make an incision here.

318
00:38:42.614 --> 00:38:48.035
- <i>Try and remove one of the digitals from--</i>
- You're gonna do what?

319
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.205
<i>Finger. I'm gonna try and get
his finger off. Just a minute.</i>

320
00:38:56.503 --> 00:39:00.131
- <i>No, that's not-- It's tearing his scalp.
- I know!</i>

321
00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:04.210
It's not coming off without
tearing his face off with it.

322
00:39:04.594 --> 00:39:06.428
- We'll have to take a look at him inside.
- Right.

323
00:39:09.975 --> 00:39:12.726
How come they don't freeze him?

324
00:39:12.811 --> 00:39:15.729
<i>How come you guys don't freeze him?</i>

325
00:39:31.371 --> 00:39:33.531
All right, you can take your mask off.

326
00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.272
What's it got down his throat?

327
00:39:54.272 --> 00:39:56.272
<i>I would suggest it's
feeding him oxygen.</i>

328
00:39:58.056 --> 00:39:59.860
Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma...

329
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.860
then keeps him alive.

330
00:40:02.944 --> 00:40:04.479
Now what the hell is that?

331
00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:06.723
Oh, we gotta get it off of him.

332
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:08.825
Just a minute. Just a minute.

333
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.869
I mean, let's not be too hasty.

334
00:40:12.454 --> 00:40:14.422
We don't know anything about...

335
00:40:14.706 --> 00:40:16.165
<i>it.</i>

336
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.960
Now, we're assuming it's feeding
him oxygen, if we remove it...

337
00:40:21.213 --> 00:40:23.014
it could kill him.

338
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.071
I'm willing to take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.

339
00:40:28.094 --> 00:40:29.047
You'll take responsibility?

340
00:40:29.147 --> 00:40:32.047
Yes, yes, I'll take responsibility.
Now get him out of there.

341
00:40:33.558 --> 00:40:35.284
<i>Where do you wanna do this?</i>

342
00:40:35.769 --> 00:40:38.938
We'll make an incision
just below the knuckle there.

343
00:40:39.064 --> 00:40:40.689
- Right here.
- <i>Stand by.</i>

344
00:40:49.491 --> 00:40:50.492
<i>Good God!</i>

345
00:40:51.092 --> 00:40:52.092
<i>Jesus.</i>

346
00:40:55.413 --> 00:40:57.407
<i>That crap's gonna
eat through the hull.</i>

347
00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:02.419
That thing's gonna eat through
the goddamn hull! Come on!

348
00:41:02.504 --> 00:41:03.847
<i>What's going on?</i>

349
00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:06.132
This way.

350
00:41:15.667 --> 00:41:16.851
<i>Next deck.</i>

351
00:41:35.187 --> 00:41:36.087
<i>There it is.</i>

352
00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:40.457
Don't get under it!
Don't get under it.

353
00:41:46.298 --> 00:41:47.794
Looks like it's stopping.

354
00:41:51.177 --> 00:41:53.095
- Take a look at this, man.
- Yeah.

355
00:41:53.179 --> 00:41:56.224
Brett, give me, uh, what do you got, a pen there?
Give it to me, quick.

356
00:41:56.808 --> 00:41:57.808
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

357
00:42:03.856 --> 00:42:05.316
<i>Don't get any on your arm.</i>

358
00:42:13.024 --> 00:42:14.426
It stopped.

359
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.455
Don't see anything like that except, uh...

360
00:42:18.355 --> 00:42:19.455
<i>molecular acid.</i>

361
00:42:19.539 --> 00:42:21.624
It must be using it for blood.

362
00:42:22.709 --> 00:42:24.626
It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.

363
00:42:24.911 --> 00:42:26.720
<i>You don't dare kill it.</i>

364
00:42:27.005 --> 00:42:28.181
What about Kane?

365
00:42:30.842 --> 00:42:32.303
Here's your pen back.

366
00:42:33.303 --> 00:42:34.303
<i>What do we do now?</i>

367
00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:37.214
<i>Leave Kane to Ash.
You get back to work.</i>

368
00:42:39.726 --> 00:42:41.643
Well, what--

369
00:42:50.428 --> 00:42:51.863
Okay.

370
00:42:52.989 --> 00:42:56.266
Try it.

371
00:42:59.913 --> 00:43:01.914
Damn it.
I thought sure that was it.

372
00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.292
Try it again.

373
00:43:05.377 --> 00:43:08.003
I feel like I've been
in this place a month.

374
00:43:09.464 --> 00:43:12.049
We shouldn't have landed in
this place in the first place.

375
00:43:13.718 --> 00:43:16.671
Shouldn't have landed on this
damn ball, I know that.

376
00:43:18.056 --> 00:43:22.809
Well, the sooner we patch this thing up and
get out of here, the sooner we can go home.

377
00:43:22.893 --> 00:43:24.627
This place gives me the creeps.

378
00:44:27.917 --> 00:44:30.461
<i>That's amazing. What is it?</i>

379
00:44:32.005 --> 00:44:35.215
Ah, yes, it is.
Um...

380
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.426
I don't know yet.

381
00:44:40.221 --> 00:44:43.098
Did you want something?

382
00:44:43.183 --> 00:44:45.476
<i>Yes. I, uh...</i>

383
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.189
<i>I'd like to have a little talk.
How's, uh... how's Kane?</i>

384
00:44:50.273 --> 00:44:52.858
He's holding. No changes.

385
00:44:52.942 --> 00:44:57.271
<i>And, uh... our guest?</i>

386
00:44:57.697 --> 00:45:00.616
- Mmm.
- <i>Hmm?</i>

387
00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.576
Well, as I said, I'm still...

388
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.620
collating, actually, but, uh,

389
00:45:04.704 --> 00:45:08.749
I have confirmed that he's got an outer
layer of protein polysaccharides.

390
00:45:10.502 --> 00:45:12.794
He has a funny habit
of shedding his cells

391
00:45:12.879 --> 00:45:16.715
and replacing them with
polarized silicon...

392
00:45:16.799 --> 00:45:18.926
which gives him a prolonged resistance

393
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.930
to adverse environmental conditions.

394
00:45:23.056 --> 00:45:24.157
Is that enough for you?

395
00:45:24.357 --> 00:45:26.157
<i>That's plenty.
What does it mean?</i>

396
00:45:27.183 --> 00:45:28.635
Please don't do that. Thank you.

397
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.763
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

398
00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:33.565
Well, it's an interesting
combination of elements,

399
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.895
making him a... tough little son of a bitch.

400
00:45:38.279 --> 00:45:40.456
And you let him in.

401
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.116
I was obeying a direct order, remember?

402
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:47.287
Ash, when Dallas and Kane
are off the ship,

403
00:45:47.372 --> 00:45:49.456
<i>I'm</i> Senior Officer.

404
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:52.017
<i>Oh, yes. I forgot.</i>

405
00:45:52.502 --> 00:45:56.221
You also forgot the Science
Division's Basic Quarantine Law.

406
00:45:56.347 --> 00:45:58.215
- No, that I didn't forget.
- Oh, I see.

407
00:45:58.299 --> 00:46:00.968
You just broke it, huh?

408
00:46:01.052 --> 00:46:04.680
Look, what would you
have done with Kane? Hmm?

409
00:46:04.764 --> 00:46:08.058
You knew his only chance of
survival was to get him in here.

410
00:46:08.142 --> 00:46:10.561
<i>Unfortunately, by, uh,
breaking quarantine,</i>

411
00:46:10.645 --> 00:46:12.604
<i>you risk everybody's life.</i>

412
00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:15.774
Maybe I should've left him outside.

413
00:46:15.858 --> 00:46:19.695
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

414
00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:21.947
That's a pretty big risk...

415
00:46:22.031 --> 00:46:23.949
for a Science Officer.

416
00:46:24.033 --> 00:46:27.411
It's, uh, not exactly
out of the manual, is it?

417
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:32.249
I <i>do</i> take my responsibilities
as seriously as you, you know.

418
00:46:33.418 --> 00:46:35.335
<i>You do your job...</i>

419
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.546
and let me do mine, yes?

420
00:46:56.924 --> 00:47:00.861
- <i>Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.</i>

421
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:06.993
Dallas.

422
00:47:07.002 --> 00:47:08.493
<i>I think you should
have a look at Kane.</i>

423
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.623
Why?

424
00:47:10.623 --> 00:47:12.623
<i>Something's happened.</i>

425
00:47:12.749 --> 00:47:13.751
Serious?

426
00:47:13.751 --> 00:47:15.751
<i>Interesting.</i>

427
00:47:20.298 --> 00:47:22.257
Ripley, meet me in the
infirmary right away.

428
00:47:26.587 --> 00:47:28.347
<i>Where is it?</i>

429
00:47:28.431 --> 00:47:31.770
<i>Well, I don't know. I mean,
we ought to try and find it.</i>

430
00:47:31.771 --> 00:47:33.268
<i>Yeah, let's check it.</i>

431
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:02.214
Dallas, please be careful.

432
00:48:40.545 --> 00:48:42.371
<i>Oh!</i>

433
00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:44.232
Sorry.

434
00:49:17.457 --> 00:49:21.668
No, not in the corner.
Psst. Have one of these.

435
00:49:23.254 --> 00:49:25.172
<i>Just in case.</i>

436
00:49:37.602 --> 00:49:41.104
Kane? Dallas?

437
00:49:45.234 --> 00:49:46.403
You okay?

438
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:48.403
<i>I didn't see it.
Was it in the overhead?</i>

439
00:49:48.529 --> 00:49:52.282
- What? It was up there somewhere.
- My God.

440
00:49:52.408 --> 00:49:55.535
- <i>Cover up the damn thing, will ya?
- Wait.</i>

441
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:56.820
That's alive!

442
00:49:58.206 --> 00:50:00.207
That's a reflex action.

443
00:50:02.226 --> 00:50:04.044
Well, we've gotta
have a look at this.

444
00:50:16.632 --> 00:50:18.099
Excuse me.

445
00:50:24.732 --> 00:50:27.784
- <i>Seems dead enough.
- Well, good! Let's get rid of it.</i>

446
00:50:29.028 --> 00:50:31.530
Ripley...
for God's sake,

447
00:50:31.614 --> 00:50:35.033
this is the first time that we've
encountered a species like this.

448
00:50:35.117 --> 00:50:37.661
It has to go back. All sorts
of tests have to be made.

449
00:50:37.745 --> 00:50:40.205
Ash, are you kidding?
This thing bled acid.

450
00:50:40.289 --> 00:50:43.041
Who knows what it's
gonna do when it's dead.

451
00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:46.336
Think it's safe to assume
it isn't a zombie.

452
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.089
Dallas, it has to go back.

453
00:50:49.173 --> 00:50:51.675
Well, I'd soon...

454
00:50:51.759 --> 00:50:54.545
as not burn it at the stake,
but you're the Science Officer.

455
00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:56.979
- It's your decision, Ash.
- Dallas.

456
00:50:57.098 --> 00:50:59.475
How come I've got to change my mind, all right?
The decision's been made.

457
00:50:59.475 --> 00:51:01.893
I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas.
I just want you to listen.

458
00:51:01.978 --> 00:51:03.895
Will you listen to--?

459
00:51:06.274 --> 00:51:08.525
<i>Just tell me how you can leave
that kind of decision to him.</i>

460
00:51:08.609 --> 00:51:10.410
Look, I just run the ship!

461
00:51:10.495 --> 00:51:13.154
Anything that has to do with the
Science Division, <i>Ash</i> has the final word.

462
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:14.575
How does that happen?

463
00:51:14.575 --> 00:51:16.645
It happens, my dear, because that's
what the company <i>wants</i> to happen.

464
00:51:16.659 --> 00:51:19.149
Since when is that standard procedure?

465
00:51:19.153 --> 00:51:22.038
Standard procedure is to do what
the hell they tell you to do.

466
00:51:22.164 --> 00:51:23.917
<i>What's happening with the repairs?
How's it going?</i>

467
00:51:23.918 --> 00:51:25.917
Oh, they're pretty much finished now.

468
00:51:26.002 --> 00:51:27.819
<i>Why the hell didn't you tell me so?</i>

469
00:51:27.824 --> 00:51:29.589
Well, because there's still
some things left to do.

470
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:30.589
Like what?

471
00:51:30.673 --> 00:51:33.049
<i>Well... we're blind
on "B" and "C" decks.</i>

472
00:51:33.175 --> 00:51:34.711
<i>The-The reserve power system's blown--</i>

473
00:51:34.711 --> 00:51:36.011
Oh, no, no, that's a bunch of horseshit.

474
00:51:36.137 --> 00:51:37.264
We can take off without that.

475
00:51:37.264 --> 00:51:39.264
<i>Yeah, we can.
You think that's a good idea?</i>

476
00:51:39.348 --> 00:51:42.225
Look, I just wanna get the
hell out of here, all right?

477
00:52:06.417 --> 00:52:09.044
Dust in the intakes again.
Number 2's overheating.

478
00:52:09.128 --> 00:52:11.821
Spit on it for two minutes,
would you, for Christ's sake?

479
00:52:12.923 --> 00:52:14.858
<i>We're hot.
We're getting hotter.</i>

480
00:52:18.012 --> 00:52:20.340
<i>Engine room, red clip status?</i>

481
00:52:21.766 --> 00:52:25.727
- One kilometer on ascension.
- <i>Engage artificial gravity.</i>

482
00:52:25.811 --> 00:52:29.397
- <i>Engaged.</i>
- I'm altering the vector... now.

483
00:52:33.736 --> 00:52:37.837
<i>Inhibit C.N.G. control
upward to T.A.C.S.</i>

484
00:52:37.837 --> 00:52:39.020
<i>Inhibit C.N.G.--</i>

485
00:52:39.024 --> 00:52:43.662
- Struts retract.
- <i>kStruts retracted.</i>

486
00:52:43.746 --> 00:52:45.874
<i>Max stress to fifth overload.</i>

487
00:52:47.558 --> 00:52:48.818
<i>Ease it back.</i>

488
00:52:51.545 --> 00:52:53.588
<i>She's great. Beautiful.</i>

489
00:53:05.059 --> 00:53:08.186
Walk in the park. When we fix
something, we stay fixed.

490
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:11.106
- <i>Don't we, Brett, baby?
- Right.</i>

491
00:53:26.414 --> 00:53:28.373
<i>What I think we should do
is just freeze him.</i>

492
00:53:28.457 --> 00:53:30.709
I mean, if he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it where it is?

493
00:53:30.793 --> 00:53:34.201
- He can always get to a doctor when we get back home.
- Right.

494
00:53:34.201 --> 00:53:38.174
Whenever he says <i>anything</i>, you say "right", Brett.
You know that?

495
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.351
Right.

496
00:53:40.353 --> 00:53:43.430
Parker, what do you think? Your staff
just follows you around, and says "right."

497
00:53:43.514 --> 00:53:45.932
- Just like a regular parrot.
- Yeah, shape up.

498
00:53:46.016 --> 00:53:48.414
- What are you, some kind of parrot?
- Right.

499
00:53:48.415 --> 00:53:50.305
Oh, come on, knock it off!

500
00:53:50.405 --> 00:53:52.805
Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine.
That's it!

501
00:53:52.809 --> 00:53:54.383
Yes, and so will we.

502
00:53:55.067 --> 00:53:57.318
Well, how about a little something
to lower your spirits?

503
00:53:57.403 --> 00:53:58.887
Thrill me, will you, please?

504
00:53:59.572 --> 00:54:01.410
Well, according to my calculations,

505
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.491
based on time spent getting
to and from the planet--

506
00:54:03.617 --> 00:54:05.870
Just give me the short version.
How far to Earth?

507
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:07.950
- Ten months.
- Oh, God.

508
00:54:07.954 --> 00:54:08.372
Great.

509
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.090
Yes?

510
00:54:11.175 --> 00:54:13.001
<i>Dallas, I think you should
come and see Kane.</i>

511
00:54:13.002 --> 00:54:15.044
Has his condition changed?

512
00:54:15.044 --> 00:54:16.327
<i>It's simpler if you'd
just come and see him.</i>

513
00:54:16.329 --> 00:54:17.529
<i>We're on our way.</i>

514
00:54:19.925 --> 00:54:22.594
Right.

515
00:54:24.972 --> 00:54:27.048
<i>How are you doing?</i>

516
00:54:29.727 --> 00:54:32.395
- Thank you.
- <i>How you doin'?</i>

517
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.689
Um, terrific.
Next silly question.

518
00:54:38.277 --> 00:54:40.020
Oh, thank you.

519
00:54:42.364 --> 00:54:44.991
Do you remember anything
about the planet?

520
00:54:47.912 --> 00:54:50.330
What's the last thing
you <i>do</i> remember?

521
00:54:51.874 --> 00:54:54.083
Huh?

522
00:54:57.254 --> 00:54:59.172
I remember some...

523
00:54:59.256 --> 00:55:01.925
horrible dream about...
smothering.

524
00:55:02.009 --> 00:55:03.802
And--

525
00:55:03.886 --> 00:55:06.387
And-- Anyway,
where are we?

526
00:55:06.514 --> 00:55:08.848
- Right here.
- We're on our way home.

527
00:55:08.853 --> 00:55:11.017
Yeah, back to the old freezerinos.

528
00:55:13.187 --> 00:55:15.355
Could I have something to eat
before we go back?

529
00:55:15.439 --> 00:55:17.273
I-I need something myself.

530
00:55:17.358 --> 00:55:20.985
Yeah, right. One more meal
before bedtime. I'm buyin'.

531
00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:24.155
- Hey, that's a break.
- <i>Bedtime.</i>

532
00:55:43.926 --> 00:55:46.469
The first thing that I'm
gonna do when I get back

533
00:55:46.554 --> 00:55:48.555
is to... get some decent food.

534
00:55:48.639 --> 00:55:51.249
I can dig it, man. Let me tell you,
I've eaten worse food than this, but,

535
00:55:51.475 --> 00:55:52.822
then I've tasted better,
you know what I'm sayin'?

536
00:55:52.843 --> 00:55:54.143
<i>The other one over there.</i>

537
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.114
Well, you pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.

538
00:55:57.198 --> 00:56:01.492
Listen, I'd rather be eatin' something else,
but, uh... right now I'm thinkin' food.

539
00:56:02.076 --> 00:56:04.696
<i>Well, you should know.
You know what it's made of.</i>

540
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.824
No, man, I don't wanna talk about
what it's made of.

541
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:09.909
I'm eatin' this just to--

542
00:56:11.287 --> 00:56:12.672
What's the matter?

543
00:56:12.689 --> 00:56:15.498
- The food ain't <i>that</i> bad, baby.
- What's wrong, Kane?

544
00:56:16.224 --> 00:56:17.542
Are you choking?</i>

545
00:56:17.626 --> 00:56:19.502
What's wrong?

546
00:56:21.297 --> 00:56:22.464
What's wrong?

547
00:56:22.797 --> 00:56:23.564
What? What?

548
00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:24.793
This is serious.

549
00:56:25.597 --> 00:56:26.593
Kane, what's the matter?

550
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.580
It's okay!

551
00:56:29.864 --> 00:56:34.192
- <i>Get a spoon in his mouth. Now!</i>
- Hold him down. Hold him--

552
00:56:36.276 --> 00:56:37.603
<i>Get the spoon in!</i>

553
00:56:38.687 --> 00:56:40.273
Dammit!

554
00:56:40.399 --> 00:56:42.650
- Get it into his mouth!
- I'm trying!

555
00:57:12.514 --> 00:57:14.690
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

556
00:57:22.524 --> 00:57:24.567
No! Don't touch it!
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

557
00:57:41.168 --> 00:57:43.094
<i>Dallas?</i>

558
00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.664
<i>Dallas?</i>

559
00:57:45.269 --> 00:57:46.064
<i>Yeah.</i>

560
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:49.426
- <i>Anything?
- No. You?</i>

561
00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.045
<i>Nothing.</i>

562
00:57:52.471 --> 00:57:55.056
- <i>You see anything?
- No.</i>

563
00:58:16.546 --> 00:58:18.126
<i>Inner hatch sealed.</i>

564
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:24.093
<i>Anybody wanna say anything?</i>

565
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:04.250
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.

566
00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:06.252
It's got a portable battery,

567
00:59:06.336 --> 00:59:09.047
<i>it's insulated all the way here,
all the way up to here.</i>

568
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:12.091
Just make damn sure nobody puts
their hand on the end of it.

569
00:59:15.637 --> 00:59:17.555
<i>It shouldn't damage the little bastard,</i>

570
00:59:17.639 --> 00:59:20.141
unless its skin's thinner than ours.

571
00:59:20.225 --> 00:59:24.395
But... it will give him
a little incentive.

572
00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.481
Now we just have to find it.

573
00:59:26.565 --> 00:59:30.401
I've taken care of that.
I've designed this... tracking device.

574
00:59:30.486 --> 00:59:34.606
You just set it to search for
a moving object, like so.

575
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.492
<i>Hasn't got much of a range, but when
you get within a certain distance,</i>

576
00:59:37.576 --> 00:59:39.619
<i>it'll start to give off a signal.</i>

577
00:59:39.703 --> 00:59:41.199
What's it key on?

578
00:59:42.873 --> 00:59:46.626
Micro changes in air density.

579
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:48.287
Give me a demo.

580
00:59:50.756 --> 00:59:54.425
<i>See? Again.</i>

581
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:56.844
Got ya.

582
00:59:56.929 --> 01:00:00.431
Two teams.
Ash, Lambert and I.

583
01:00:00.516 --> 01:00:03.935
Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.

584
01:00:04.019 --> 01:00:06.521
Now, anyone see this thing,
you catch it in the net...

585
01:00:06.605 --> 01:00:08.731
that Parker's holding on his lap.

586
01:00:08.816 --> 01:00:11.734
Parker, I don't want any
heroics out of you, all right?

587
01:00:11.819 --> 01:00:15.238
<i>Catch it, put it in
the air lock, get rid of it.</i>

588
01:00:15.322 --> 01:00:17.198
<i>Now, channels are open on all decks.</i>

589
01:00:17.282 --> 01:00:21.410
I want you to communicate, keep in
touch at all times, all right?

590
01:00:21.495 --> 01:00:22.896
Let's go.

591
01:00:28.043 --> 01:00:29.710
<i>I thought you fixed 12 module.</i>

592
01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:31.963
<i>We did.</i>

593
01:00:32.947 --> 01:00:34.090
<i>I don't understand it.</i>

594
01:00:37.218 --> 01:00:39.311
<i>The circuits must have burned out.</i>

595
01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:52.751
<i>What do we got here?</i>

596
01:00:52.855 --> 01:00:54.851
<i>Dammit! Hold your light
over here, would you?

597
01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:56.153
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

598
01:00:57.338 --> 01:01:00.199
- <i>I don't know if this is going to work.
- Right.</i>

599
01:01:00.284 --> 01:01:03.390
<i>Oh. If I could just put this--
put this in there.</i>

600
01:01:03.395 --> 01:01:05.746
- <i>Right.
- Oh, dammit.</i>

601
01:01:09.659 --> 01:01:11.419
<i>Check the insulation.</i>

602
01:01:11.903 --> 01:01:13.421
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

603
01:01:36.477 --> 01:01:39.155
- Steady.
- According to this, it's within five meters.

604
01:01:44.119 --> 01:01:46.954
<i>Micro changes in air density, my ass.</i>

605
01:01:52.669 --> 01:01:55.129
<i>It's within five meters.</i>

606
01:01:55.213 --> 01:01:57.048
<i>Be careful.</i>

607
01:02:06.942 --> 01:02:09.060
- <i>Christ.
- Don't do that. Don't creep up on me with that thing.</i>

608
01:02:09.065 --> 01:02:10.738
<i>You guys, stick together.</i>

609
01:02:27.913 --> 01:02:31.624
- Don't fail me now.
- <i>What?</i>

610
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.700
- What is it?
- Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!

611
01:02:33.702 --> 01:02:34.820
Where?

612
01:02:36.004 --> 01:02:38.005
Here, here, take this.</i>

613
01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:40.508
Get over there and get the net.

614
01:02:40.634 --> 01:02:43.219
- Got it?
- I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

615
01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.888
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

616
01:02:47.241 --> 01:02:50.085
All right, Parker.
When I say...

617
01:02:52.487 --> 01:02:54.271
All right, now!

618
01:02:54.356 --> 01:02:55.357
Easy.

619
01:03:00.028 --> 01:03:02.655
Wait! Don't let him go!

620
01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:04.949
What the hell are you doing, man!?

621
01:03:05.033 --> 01:03:06.951
It's the cat, man.

622
01:03:13.417 --> 01:03:16.293
Hey, look, now.
We had to bag it, man.

623
01:03:16.378 --> 01:03:18.088
Now we might pick it up
on the tracker again.

624
01:03:19.715 --> 01:03:21.966
- I'll-I'll-I'll--
- Go and get it, man.

625
01:03:22.968 --> 01:03:25.085
All right. You get him.
We'll go on.

626
01:03:36.158 --> 01:03:37.616
Here, kitty!

627
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.277
Here, kitty, kitty!

628
01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:43.288
Enough of that kitty crap.

629
01:03:43.672 --> 01:03:44.992
Jones?

630
01:03:48.076 --> 01:03:49.594
Jonesy?

631
01:03:50.078 --> 01:03:51.679
Here, Jonesy!

632
01:03:59.838 --> 01:04:01.456
Jonesy?

633
01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:09.263
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

634
01:04:15.771 --> 01:04:17.147
Here, Jonesy.

635
01:04:29.951 --> 01:04:31.827
Jonesy?

636
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.057
Here, kitty, kitty.

637
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.055
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

638
01:06:16.808 --> 01:06:18.643
Here, Jonesy.

639
01:06:19.227 --> 01:06:21.228
Jonesy.

640
01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:25.482
Kitty, kitty.

641
01:06:59.142 --> 01:07:01.352
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

642
01:07:05.065 --> 01:07:06.766
Jonesy?

643
01:07:14.074 --> 01:07:16.909
Hey. Hey.
Come on, Jonesy.

644
01:07:16.993 --> 01:07:19.286
Come on, baby.
That's a kitty.

645
01:07:19.371 --> 01:07:22.748
<i>That's a kitty.
Come on, baby.</i>

646
01:07:22.832 --> 01:07:25.626
That's a kitty.

647
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.588
Hey, hey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

648
01:07:29.673 --> 01:07:31.674
<i>Come on.</i>

649
01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:03.038
Brett!

650
01:08:03.123 --> 01:08:05.457
<i>Brett!</i>

651
01:08:12.716 --> 01:08:15.301
<i>Brett!</i>

652
01:08:24.019 --> 01:08:27.195
Whatever it was, it was--
it was big and--

653
01:08:30.317 --> 01:08:32.209
You're sure it took him
into the air shaft?

654
01:08:32.294 --> 01:08:34.442
Disappeared into
one of the cooling ducts.

655
01:08:34.446 --> 01:08:38.181
No question, it's...
it's using the air ducts to move around.

656
01:08:41.411 --> 01:08:43.579
Could he want Brett alive?

657
01:08:44.714 --> 01:08:47.244
- What?
- Could Brett be alive?

658
01:08:47.267 --> 01:08:50.336
No. I mean...
I don't think so.

659
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:54.340
Well, this air shaft may
work to our advantage.

660
01:08:54.424 --> 01:08:58.719
Here it leads up to and comes out
in the main air lock.

661
01:08:59.304 --> 01:09:01.597
All right, there's only one
big opening along the way.

662
01:09:01.681 --> 01:09:05.017
We can cover that up,
and then we...

663
01:09:05.101 --> 01:09:07.603
drive it into the air lock
and zap it into outer space.

664
01:09:07.687 --> 01:09:10.064
This son of a bitch is <i>huge!</i>

665
01:09:10.148 --> 01:09:13.525
- <i>I mean, it's like a man. It's big!</i>
- Kane's son.

666
01:09:15.945 --> 01:09:18.489
Come on, Ash. I mean, Science Department
should be able to help us.

667
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:20.866
What can we do to drive it?

668
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:23.343
Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably
well to our atmosphere,

669
01:09:23.343 --> 01:09:25.412
considering its nutritional requirements.

670
01:09:25.538 --> 01:09:28.082
- The only thing we don't know about is temperature.
- Okay. What about temperature?

671
01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:30.876
- What happens if we change it?
- <i>Let's try it.</i>

672
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.254
I mean, most animals
retreat from fire. Yes?

673
01:09:34.339 --> 01:09:36.799
Fire, yeah.
Parker, can you rig,

674
01:09:36.883 --> 01:09:39.385
<i>uh, three or four incinerator units?</i>

675
01:09:39.469 --> 01:09:42.054
Give me about 20 minutes.
I'll do it.

676
01:09:42.538 --> 01:09:43.806
Who gets to go into the vent?

677
01:09:44.406 --> 01:09:45.606
I do.

678
01:09:46.218 --> 01:09:50.270
No. You and Ash...

679
01:09:50.355 --> 01:09:52.523
take the main air lock.

680
01:09:52.607 --> 01:09:56.402
Parker, Lambert, you cover up that
maintenance opening, please.

681
01:09:56.486 --> 01:09:58.904
<i>Right.</i>

682
01:10:28.143 --> 01:10:29.987
<i>I'm at the first junction.</i>

683
01:10:30.687 --> 01:10:31.987
Dallas, I'm right here.

684
01:10:31.991 --> 01:10:33.766
- <i>Parker?</i>
- Yeah.

685
01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:35.346
<i>Lambert?</i>

686
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:37.943
<i>We're in position. I'm just
trying to get a reading here.</i>

687
01:10:38.127 --> 01:10:39.579
The air lock is open.

688
01:10:39.779 --> 01:10:41.179
<i>Okay, Ripley.</i>

689
01:10:41.264 --> 01:10:43.532
Ready.

690
01:10:53.676 --> 01:10:55.627
<i>All right. I've got
a reading on you now.</i>

691
01:11:11.128 --> 01:11:14.122
Uh, open the hatch
to the third junction.

692
01:11:31.297 --> 01:11:33.073
<i>Okay, I'm through.</i>

693
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.917
- <i>Ripley?</i>
- Yes.

694
01:11:35.002 --> 01:11:37.595
<i>Close all the hatches behind me.</i>

695
01:11:38.379 --> 01:11:39.847
<i>I'm moving on.</i>

696
01:11:55.271 --> 01:11:57.481
<i>Dallas, hold it a minute.
I think I got it.</i>

697
01:11:58.907 --> 01:12:00.236
<i>Yes, I've got it.</i>

698
01:12:00.243 --> 01:12:01.736
<i>Where?</i>

699
01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.673
<i>It's somewhere around
the third junction.</i>

700
01:12:06.157 --> 01:12:08.158
Okay, moving on.

701
01:12:27.512 --> 01:12:30.556
<i>It is right around there. Now, Dallas,
you're gonna have to be careful.</i>

702
01:12:41.276 --> 01:12:46.405
All right.
I've reached...

703
01:12:46.489 --> 01:12:49.925
the third junction,
and I'm going down.

704
01:13:07.427 --> 01:13:09.262
The hell's the matter with that box?

705
01:13:11.147 --> 01:13:14.641
Dallas, you're gonna have to hold
your position for a minute. I...

706
01:13:15.526 --> 01:13:16.768
<i>I've lost the signal.</i>

707
01:13:17.253 --> 01:13:19.771
What?
You sure?

708
01:13:19.856 --> 01:13:23.542
<i>Look around. Are you sure that it's not there?
I mean, it's got to be around there somewhere.</i>

709
01:13:28.114 --> 01:13:31.992
<i>Check that out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.</i>

710
01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:33.910
<i>Dallas, are you sure
there's no sign of it?</i>

711
01:13:33.995 --> 01:13:35.507
<i>I mean, it</i> is <i>there.</i>

712
01:13:37.207 --> 01:13:38.707
<i>It's gotta be around there.</i>

713
01:13:40.618 --> 01:13:41.805
Dallas?

714
01:13:43.305 --> 01:13:45.505
God, what is happening?

715
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:47.583
<i>All right.</i>

716
01:13:52.388 --> 01:13:56.850
Uh, am I... am I clear, Lambert?
I want to get the hell out of here.

717
01:13:59.062 --> 01:14:01.646
<i>Oh, God. It's moving
right towards you.</i>

718
01:14:03.733 --> 01:14:05.567
Uh...

719
01:14:09.822 --> 01:14:14.159
Move! Get out of there!
Behind you! Move!

720
01:14:14.243 --> 01:14:17.329
Dallas! Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas!</i>

721
01:14:17.413 --> 01:14:21.083
<i>Get out!
Move!</i>

722
01:14:21.167 --> 01:14:22.834
The other way, God!

723
01:14:24.754 --> 01:14:26.505
Dallas?

724
01:14:26.631 --> 01:14:28.382
- No...
- Take it easy.

725
01:14:28.466 --> 01:14:30.792
<i>Dallas?</i>

726
01:14:36.099 --> 01:14:38.066
We found this laying there.

727
01:14:39.936 --> 01:14:42.187
No blood...

728
01:14:42.271 --> 01:14:43.890
no Dallas...

729
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:46.590
nothing.

730
01:14:51.948 --> 01:14:54.408
- <i>How come I don't hear nobody saying nothing?</i>
- I'm thinking.

731
01:14:57.895 --> 01:15:02.040
Unless somebody has
got a better idea...

732
01:15:02.925 --> 01:15:04.676
we'll proceed with Dallas' plan.

733
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:08.213
What? And end up like the others?

734
01:15:08.297 --> 01:15:10.715
Ohh. No, you're
out of your mind.

735
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.053
- Got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.

736
01:15:15.138 --> 01:15:17.389
We get the shuttle and just
get the hell out of here.

737
01:15:17.473 --> 01:15:20.514
We take our chances and just hope
that somebody picks us up.

738
01:15:20.518 --> 01:15:22.394
Lambert...

739
01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.231
- The shuttle won't take four.
- <i>Then why don't we draw straws and--</i>

740
01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:29.401
I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for
killing that goddamn thing right now.

741
01:15:29.485 --> 01:15:31.528
<i>Okay.</i>

742
01:15:31.654 --> 01:15:33.655
Well, let's talk about killing it.

743
01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:36.867
We know it's using the air shafts--
Will you listen to me, Parker?!

744
01:15:36.993 --> 01:15:39.786
- Shut up!
- Let's hear it.

745
01:15:40.471 --> 01:15:41.788
Let's hear it.

746
01:15:41.873 --> 01:15:45.083
It's using the air shafts.

747
01:15:45.209 --> 01:15:47.961
- We don't know that.
- That's the only way!

748
01:15:48.045 --> 01:15:51.131
We'll move in pairs.
We'll go step by step...

749
01:15:51.215 --> 01:15:54.134
and cut off every bulkhead
and every vent

750
01:15:54.218 --> 01:15:57.471
until we have it cornered, and then
we'll blow it the fuck out into space.

751
01:15:57.555 --> 01:15:59.723
Is that acceptable to you?

752
01:15:59.849 --> 01:16:04.936
- If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.
- Obviously, it means killing it.

753
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:06.813
But we have to stick together.

754
01:16:08.191 --> 01:16:11.610
- <i>How are our weapons?</i>
- The weapons are fine.

755
01:16:11.736 --> 01:16:15.614
- This one needs refueling.
- <i>Will you get it, please?

756
01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.543
- Ash, go with him.
- No, no. I can manage, Ash.

757
01:16:19.827 --> 01:16:21.828
Don't follow me.

758
01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:26.875
Ash?

759
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:31.171
Any suggestions from you or Mother?

760
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:35.468
<i>No, we're still collating.</i>

761
01:16:37.053 --> 01:16:39.304
You're what?

762
01:16:39.388 --> 01:16:41.598
You're "still collating"?

763
01:16:41.982 --> 01:16:44.726
I find that hard to believe.

764
01:16:46.771 --> 01:16:49.940
- What would you like me to do?
- <i>Just what you've been doing, Ash...</i>

765
01:16:50.024 --> 01:16:51.184
<i>Nothing.</i>

766
01:16:51.484 --> 01:16:52.984
<i>I've got access to Mother now,</i>

767
01:16:53.069 --> 01:16:55.829
<i>and I'll get my own answers,
thank you.</i>

768
01:16:58.658 --> 01:17:00.201
All right.

769
01:18:39.091 --> 01:18:42.385
There is an explanation
for this, you know.

770
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:46.473
Is there really? I don't wanna
hear your goddamn explanation!

771
01:18:48.601 --> 01:18:51.770
I want-- I want--

772
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:57.400
I want-- I w--

773
01:19:03.824 --> 01:19:06.951
Parker? Lambert?

774
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:18.588
Ash, open the door.

775
01:19:28.224 --> 01:19:30.225
Ash?

776
01:19:34.046 --> 01:19:35.347
<i>Will you open the door?</i>

777
01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:41.485
Let me by, Ash.

778
01:20:17.148 --> 01:20:19.149
Yaah!

779
01:21:03.127 --> 01:21:05.528
The hell are you doing?

780
01:21:12.828 --> 01:21:14.829
Aahhh!

781
01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.133
<i>Get her up. Get her up! Get her up!
Get her up! Get her up! Get her up!</i>

782
01:21:38.521 --> 01:21:40.855
Android!
He's an android!

783
01:21:55.763 --> 01:21:57.664
Jesus!

784
01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:04.128
<i>It's a robot!
Ash is a goddamn robot!</i>

785
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:07.299
God!

786
01:22:10.761 --> 01:22:14.430
<i>Oh! Get off me--
Oh!</i>

787
01:22:14.515 --> 01:22:16.474
<i>Holy shit!</i>

788
01:22:16.559 --> 01:22:21.020
Help! Help me get
this fucking thing off!

789
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.235
Aah!

790
01:22:27.996 --> 01:22:31.947
- Oh, God!
- Jesus! Oh, God!

791
01:22:35.661 --> 01:22:38.621
<i>How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?</i>

792
01:22:38.706 --> 01:22:42.458
<i>All I can think of is they must've wanted
the alien for their Weapons Division.</i>

793
01:22:42.543 --> 01:22:45.336
<i>He's been protecting it right along.</i>

794
01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:47.672
<i>Parker, will you plug it in?</i>

795
01:22:47.798 --> 01:22:52.677
- <i>Uh... I don't know why--
- Because he may know how to kill it.</i>

796
01:23:17.911 --> 01:23:20.113
<i>Ash, can you hear me?</i>

797
01:23:23.584 --> 01:23:24.809
<i>Ash!</i>

798
01:23:32.635 --> 01:23:34.986
Yes, I can hear you.

799
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:41.696
What was your Special Order?

800
01:23:42.196 --> 01:23:44.996
You read it. I thought it was clear.

801
01:23:45.481 --> 01:23:46.484
What was it?

802
01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:49.484
Bring back life-form.

803
01:23:49.568 --> 01:23:54.238
Priority one.
All other priorities rescinded.

804
01:23:57.242 --> 01:24:01.954
The damn company! What about our lives,
you son of a bitch?

805
01:24:02.039 --> 01:24:06.000
I repeat... All other priorities
are rescinded.

806
01:24:06.085 --> 01:24:08.461
<i>How do we kill it, Ash?</i>

807
01:24:08.545 --> 01:24:11.964
<i>There's got to be a way of killing it.
How-How do we do it?</i>

808
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:14.142
You can't.

809
01:24:14.927 --> 01:24:16.031
That's bullshit!

810
01:24:16.331 --> 01:24:19.331
You still don't understand what
you're dealing with, do you?

811
01:24:21.892 --> 01:24:24.394
A perfect organism.

812
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:30.817
Its structural perfection is
matched only by its hostility.

813
01:24:31.801 --> 01:24:33.111
You admire it.

814
01:24:37.199 --> 01:24:39.283
I admire its purity.

815
01:24:43.622 --> 01:24:45.540
A survivor...

816
01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:51.879
unclouded... by conscience,

817
01:24:51.964 --> 01:24:55.633
remorse or delusions of morality.

818
01:24:57.594 --> 01:25:00.263
<i>Look, I-I've heard
enough of this...</i>

819
01:25:00.347 --> 01:25:02.765
and I'm asking you
to pull the plug.

820
01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:03.985
<i>Last word.</i>

821
01:25:05.785 --> 01:25:06.585
What?

822
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:12.066
I can't lie to you
about your chances, but...

823
01:25:15.237 --> 01:25:17.739
you have my sympathies.

824
01:25:19.859 --> 01:25:23.202
We're gonna blow up the ship.

825
01:25:23.287 --> 01:25:26.038
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.

826
01:25:26.165 --> 01:25:28.499
- Blow up the ship.
- Good.

827
01:25:28.684 --> 01:25:30.585
Come on.

828
01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:00.639
- When we throw the switches, how long before the ship blows?
- <i>Ten minutes.</i>

829
01:26:00.665 --> 01:26:02.992
- No bullshit.
- If we ain't outta here in ten minutes,

830
01:26:02.992 --> 01:26:05.487
we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

831
01:26:06.771 --> 01:26:09.540
We're gonna need coolant
for the air support system.

832
01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:17.901
You two go down, get all
the coolant you can carry.

833
01:26:18.783 --> 01:26:21.202
I'll get the shuttle ready.
I'll give you about...

834
01:26:21.955 --> 01:26:23.179
about seven minutes.

835
01:26:23.563 --> 01:26:25.640
Come back up here.
I'll shut the switches off,

836
01:26:25.724 --> 01:26:27.600
and we'll blow this fucker
off into space.

837
01:26:27.684 --> 01:26:29.644
Okay. All right.
Come on.

838
01:26:30.528 --> 01:26:31.646
- Ready?
- Take care of yourself.

839
01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:32.956
Seven minutes.

840
01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.463
<i>Take it easy.</i>

841
01:27:03.336 --> 01:27:04.536
Jones.

842
01:27:50.642 --> 01:27:52.143
Jones?

843
01:28:22.341 --> 01:28:24.042
Okay, check the bottles.

844
01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:39.291
Jones?

845
01:28:44.696 --> 01:28:46.197
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

846
01:28:47.616 --> 01:28:49.241
Kitty.

847
01:28:49.326 --> 01:28:51.285
