1
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.754
- Got any biscuits over there?
- Here's some cornbread.

2
00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:06.092
I am cold.

3
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.053
- Still with us, Brett?
- Right.

4
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:14.309
- I feel dead.
- Anybody ever tell you look dead?

5
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.274
Oh, yeah. I forgot something.

6
00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:25.486
Before we dock,
we ought to discuss the bonus situation.

7
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:28.823
Brett and I think we deserve full shares.

8
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:33.703
Mr. Parker and I feel the bonus situation
has never been equitable.

9
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:37.123
You get what you're contracted for,
like everybody else.

10
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.542
But everybody else gets more than us.

11
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.337
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.

12
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:46.466
I saw it. Yellow light's for my eyes only.

13
00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:49.344
Get dressed, huh? Parker?

14
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.847
I haven't finished my coffee.
It's the only good thing we got.

15
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:50.655
Morning, Mother.

16
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.980
- Right?
- OK.

17
00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:26.357
Plug us in.

18
00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:29.527
Thank you.

19
00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:36.325
- Where is Earth?
- You should know.

20
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.495
It's not our system.

21
00:09:39.663 --> 00:09:41.289
Scan.

22
00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.502
I can't believe this.

23
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.338
Contact traffic control.

24
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.176
This is commercial towing vehicle
Nostromo,

25
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:58.514
out of the Solomons,
registration number 180924609,

26
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:03.144
calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me?

27
00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:06.439
Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo,
out of the Solomons,

28
00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:11.527
registration number 180924609.

29
00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:14.780
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.

30
00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:19.869
Calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me, Antarctica?

31
00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:24.499
I've found it. Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.

32
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:29.545
- We haven't reached the outer rim yet.
- That's hard to believe.

33
00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.590
What the hell are we doing out here?

34
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:37.011
Don't know.
What the hell are you talking about?

35
00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:40.515
- That's not our system.
- I know that.

36
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:46.729
Ever notice how they never come down
here? This is where the work is, right?

37
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:53.361
Same reason we get a half share to their
one. Our time is their time. Same old shit.

38
00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:55.863
I think l know why they don't come down.

39
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.699
It's because of you.
You have no personality.

40
00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:11.462
- You happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?
- Of course. Sorry.

41
00:11:16.802 --> 00:11:19.428
What's happening now, baby?

42
00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:26.060
Some of you may have figured out we're
not home yet. We're only halfway there.

43
00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.606
- What?
- Mother's interrupted our course.

44
00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:31.774
Why?

45
00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:36.487
She's programmed to do that
should certain conditions arise. They have.

46
00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:41.367
It seems she has intercepted
a transmission of unknown origin.

47
00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:45.454
- She got us up to check it out.
- A transmission? Out here?

48
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.498
What kind of transmission?

49
00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:51.377
Acoustical beacon
that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.

50
00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:53.254
- SOS?
- I don't know.

51
00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:56.299
- Human?
- Unknown.

52
00:11:56.466 --> 00:12:00.261
- So what?
- We are obligated under Section...

53
00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:05.725
- This is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.
- Right.

54
00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.728
It's not in my contract, this kind of duty.

55
00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:13.566
And what about money? Give me
some money, I'd be happy to oblige.

56
00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:16.444
Let's go over the bonus situation.

57
00:12:16.612 --> 00:12:19.155
I'm sorry, can I say something?

58
00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:23.284
There is a clause which states
"Any systematized transmission

59
00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:26.746
indicating intelligent origin
must be investigated...

60
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.165
I wanna go home and party.

61
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.626
Will you just listen to the man?

62
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:37.506
.. on penalty of total forfeiture of shares."

63
00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.050
No money.

64
00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:42.136
You got that?

65
00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:45.014
- Well, yeah.
- We're going in.

66
00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:46.932
We're going in.

67
00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:58.069
Approaching orbital apogee. Mark.

68
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.074
Equatorial orbit nailed.

69
00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.216
DOR's in line.

70
00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:24.220
- Status on the lifters?
- Give me an AC pressure reading.

71
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.354
48 seconds and counting.

72
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.609
Prepare to disengage from platform.

73
00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:40.778
20 seconds.

74
00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:43.489
1 8, 1 7...

75
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:50.538
13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7,

76
00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:56.335
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

77
00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.878
Lock.

78
00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.880
Disengage.

79
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.178
Clear.

80
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.812
Money's safe.
Let's take her down.

81
00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:26.449
- Roll 92 degrees, port yaw.
- Prime the port.

82
00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:58.397
I'm not getting anything.

83
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.156
Turbulence.

84
00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:18.417
Locked and floating.
You can drop us any time now.

85
00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:23.464
Initial damping's going off.
Hold on, there'll be a little bump.

86
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.264
What the hell was that?

87
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.850
Pressure drop. Must have lost a shield.

88
00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:36.685
Let's go with it.

89
00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:40.356
I'm still not getting anything.

90
00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.739
Dropping off now.

91
00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.950
Still dropping.

92
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.578
There we are, we've got it.

93
00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.789
Take her down.

94
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.589
Navigation lights on.

95
00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:42.793
9, 8, 7...

96
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:48.507
6, 5, 4, 3, 2,

97
00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.509
1.

98
00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.720
Kill drive engines.

99
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.867
What the hell happened?

100
00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.078
Give me an answer.

101
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:22.207
- Is the hull breached?
- I don't see anything. We still have pressure.

102
00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.961
- Push the screen.
- Why?

103
00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:38.891
Secondary load-sharing unit is out.

104
00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.977
Three of the four cells are gone.

105
00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:47.566
- Is that it?
- No, hold on.

106
00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:53.113
We can't fix it out here anyway
and we need to reroute a couple of ducts.

107
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.573
Dry-dock time.

108
00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:56.867
Tell him to dry-dock.

109
00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:01.163
We can't fix it out here.
We've gotta reroute all these ducts.

110
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.749
To do that, we've got to dry-dock.

111
00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.834
What else?

112
00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:10.422
Some fragments caked up. We've got
to clean it out and depressurize it.

113
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.133
How long before we're functional?

114
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:16.637
- Look...
- 17 hours, tell her.

115
00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.474
At least 25 hours.

116
00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.935
Get started. I'll be right down.

117
00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:26.605
- Why's she coming down here?
- She better stay the fuck out of my way.

118
00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:29.358
I'd like to see what she's gonna do
when she gets here.

119
00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.829
Any response yet?

120
00:18:41.997 --> 00:18:47.126
Absolutely nothing, except
the same transmission every 12 seconds.

121
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:50.045
All the other channels are dead.

122
00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:57.136
Kick on the floods.

123
00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:14.403
We can't go anywhere in this.

124
00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.032
Mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes.

125
00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:24.121
- How far to the source of transmission?
- Northeast. Just under 2,000 meters.

126
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:26.582
Walking distance?

127
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:32.463
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.

128
00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.929
It's almost primordial.

129
00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:46.435
Inert nitrogen, high concentration
of carbon dioxide crystals, methane...

130
00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:49.605
- I'm working on the trace elements.
- Anything else?

131
00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:53.692
There's rock, lava base.

132
00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:59.031
Deep cold, well below the line.

133
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.202
I'll volunteer to be in the first group
to go out.

134
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.996
That figures.

135
00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:10.209
- You, too, Lambert.
- Swell.

136
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:14.129
You'd better break out the weapons.

137
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:33.041
- I can't see a goddamn thing.
- Ash, are you receiving?

138
00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:40.215
Good contact on my board.

139
00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:44.511
Clear and free. Keep the line open.
Let's go.

140
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.778
Hey, Ripley.

141
00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:05.532
I want to ask you a question.

142
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.994
If they find what they're after,
do we get full shares?

143
00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:13.290
Don't worry,
you'll get whatever's coming to you.

144
00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:17.502
I'm not doing any more work
until we get this straightened out.

145
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.924
Brett, you're guaranteed by law
to get a share.

146
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:24.927
- What?
- Why don't you just fuck off?

147
00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:28.513
- What?
- What did you say?

148
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:33.060
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.

149
00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:36.313
Come back here.

150
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:44.905
- Son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

151
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:56.333
Can't see a goddamn thing.

152
00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.502
Quit griping.

153
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.338
- I like griping.
- Knock it off.

154
00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:15.811
How's it going?

155
00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:21.191
- All right.
- You put that transmission through ECIU?

156
00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:24.277
No. Mother hasn't identified it yet.

157
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:27.864
- Mind if I give it a shot?
- Please do.

158
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.778
- Ash, can you see this?
- I can.

159
00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:53.784
I've never seen anything like it.

160
00:25:01.793 --> 00:25:04.169
It's very bizarre.

161
00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:20.352
All right.

162
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.563
Moving on to second position.

163
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:25.774
What is it?

164
00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:29.986
Let's get outta here.

165
00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:33.657
We've got this far. We have to go on.

166
00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:40.288
Will you say that again?

167
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:41.456
Shit.

168
00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:46.795
As you can see, it's hard to describe.

169
00:25:46.963 --> 00:25:49.548
I'm going back to the console.

170
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.935
Dallas?

171
00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:46.873
Come on down here.
There's something different.

172
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:53.004
I don't know what it is, but if we can
get up that wall, we can find out.

173
00:29:04.327 --> 00:29:07.662
Alien life form.

174
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.832
It looks like it's been dead a long time.

175
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.501
Fossilised.

176
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:16.963
Looks like it's grown out of the chair.

177
00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:34.773
Bones are bent outward.

178
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.942
Like he exploded from inside.

179
00:29:42.448 --> 00:29:46.076
Wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.

180
00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:52.791
Let's get the hell outta here.

181
00:30:04.178 --> 00:30:05.595
Hey, Dallas.

182
00:30:05.763 --> 00:30:08.932
Lambert, come on over here.

183
00:30:09.934 --> 00:30:11.601
Come on.

184
00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:23.780
- What have you got?
- See what you make of this.

185
00:30:31.247 --> 00:30:35.417
Ash, that transmission.
Mother's deciphered part of it.

186
00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:38.336
- It doesn't look like an SOS.
- What is it, then?

187
00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:41.756
It looks like a warning.

188
00:30:41.924 --> 00:30:45.969
- I'm gonna go out after them.
- What's the point?

189
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:53.184
By the time it takes to get there,
they'll know if it's a warning or not.

190
00:31:20.296 --> 00:31:23.006
Are you OK down there?

191
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:32.640
- Can you see anything?
- A cave of some sort, but I...

192
00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:38.605
It's like the goddamn tropics in here.

193
00:31:41.108 --> 00:31:43.735
What the hell is this?

194
00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:23.399
The pit is completely enclosed.

195
00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:29.280
It's full of leathery objects,
like eggs or something.

196
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:53.555
There's a layer of mist covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.

197
00:32:57.393 --> 00:33:00.270
Kane? Are you all right?

198
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:02.522
I'm OK.

199
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:07.694
I'm OK. I just slipped.

200
00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:30.883
It appears to be completely sealed.

201
00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:59.746
Wait, there's movement.

202
00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:03.583
It seems to have organic life.

203
00:35:08.649 --> 00:35:11.109
- Are you there, Ripley?
- I'm here.

204
00:35:17.408 --> 00:35:20.702
- I'm at the inner lock hatch.
- Right.

205
00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:33.214
Are you there?
We're clean, let us in.

206
00:35:33.382 --> 00:35:37.051
- What happened to Kane?
- Something attached itself to him.

207
00:35:37.219 --> 00:35:39.721
What kind of thing?

208
00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:42.056
An organism. Open the hatch.

209
00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:46.561
If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure.

210
00:35:46.729 --> 00:35:50.398
- 24 hours for decontamination.
- He could die. Open the hatch.

211
00:35:50.566 --> 00:35:53.359
If we break quarantine, we could all die.

212
00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:57.864
Can you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside.

213
00:35:59.408 --> 00:36:01.325
No, I can't do that.

214
00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:03.244
If you were in my position
you'd do the same.

215
00:36:03.412 --> 00:36:06.330
This is an order.
Open that hatch, do you hear me?

216
00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:07.790
Yes.

217
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:12.712
- This is an order! Do you hear me?
- I read you. The answer is negative.

218
00:36:16.258 --> 00:36:18.676
Inner hatch open.

219
00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:47.330
My God.

220
00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.967
What the hell is that?

221
00:37:02.012 --> 00:37:03.638
How is he?

222
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:09.227
How are we gonna get that off him?

223
00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:14.065
- How do we get it off?
- Just a minute. I'll get some instruments.

224
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:24.909
Right. If I make an incision here

225
00:37:25.077 --> 00:37:28.371
to try and remove
one of the digits from his face...

226
00:37:28.539 --> 00:37:30.414
You're gonna do what?

227
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:33.584
Finger. I'll try and get this finger off.

228
00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:36.504
Get this cleating on there...

229
00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:42.510
- It's tearing his scalp.
- I know.

230
00:37:43.595 --> 00:37:46.514
It's not coming off
without tearing his face off with it.

231
00:37:47.516 --> 00:37:49.976
We'll have to take a look at him inside.

232
00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:55.106
How come they don't freeze him?

233
00:37:55.274 --> 00:37:58.234
How come you guys don't freeze him?

234
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:16.502
You can take your mask off.

235
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:40.234
- What's it got down his throat?
- I suggest it's feeding him oxygen.

236
00:38:40.402 --> 00:38:45.239
Paralyses him, puts him in a coma,
then keeps him alive.

237
00:38:45.407 --> 00:38:48.200
What the hell is that?

238
00:38:48.368 --> 00:38:51.996
- We've got to get it off him.
- Just a minute.

239
00:38:52.164 --> 00:38:54.665
Let's not be too hasty.

240
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:58.628
We don't know anything about it.

241
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:05.301
We're assuming it's feeding him oxygen.
If we remove it, it could kill him.

242
00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:10.431
I'll take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.

243
00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:14.101
- You take responsibility?
- Yes. Get him out of there.

244
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:18.147
Where do you want to do this?

245
00:39:18.315 --> 00:39:21.317
We'll make an incision
just below the knuckle.

246
00:39:21.485 --> 00:39:23.569
Right here?

247
00:39:31.828 --> 00:39:34.121
Good God.

248
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:40.628
That crap's gonna eat through the hull.

249
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.883
I think it's going to eat through
the goddamn hull. Come on.

250
00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:49.720
This way.

251
00:39:57.646 --> 00:39:59.814
Next deck.

252
00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:19.208
There it is.

253
00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:22.878
Don't get under it.

254
00:40:28.552 --> 00:40:30.761
Looks like it's stopping.

255
00:40:33.682 --> 00:40:35.516
Take a look at this.

256
00:40:35.684 --> 00:40:39.061
Brett, give me your pen, quick.

257
00:40:39.229 --> 00:40:41.272
Come on.

258
00:40:46.445 --> 00:40:49.071
Don't get any on your arm.

259
00:40:55.454 --> 00:40:57.580
It's stopped.

260
00:40:57.748 --> 00:41:01.834
I haven't seen anything like that,
except molecular acid.

261
00:41:02.002 --> 00:41:05.129
It must be using it for blood.

262
00:41:05.297 --> 00:41:09.175
It's got a wonderful defence mechanism.
You don't dare kill it.

263
00:41:09.342 --> 00:41:11.385
What about Kane?

264
00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:15.598
Here's your pen back.

265
00:41:15.766 --> 00:41:20.394
- What do we do now?
- Leave Kane to Ash. You get back to work.

266
00:41:32.991 --> 00:41:34.116
Okay.

267
00:41:35.452 --> 00:41:37.578
Try it.

268
00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:46.337
- Damn it. I felt sure that was it.
- Try it again.

269
00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:51.759
Feel like I've been in this place a month.

270
00:41:51.927 --> 00:41:55.888
We shouldn't have landed here
in the first place.

271
00:41:56.056 --> 00:42:00.309
Shouldn't have landed
on this damn ball, I know that.

272
00:42:00.477 --> 00:42:04.647
The sooner we patch this up,
the sooner we can go home.

273
00:42:04.815 --> 00:42:06.732
This place gives me the creeps.

274
00:43:10.297 --> 00:43:12.923
It's amazing. What is it?

275
00:43:14.426 --> 00:43:16.510
I'd say it's...

276
00:43:17.846 --> 00:43:20.097
I don't know yet.

277
00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:27.396
- Do you want something?
- Yes, I...

278
00:43:29.858 --> 00:43:32.693
A little talk. How's Kane?

279
00:43:32.861 --> 00:43:35.237
He's holding. No changes.

280
00:43:35.405 --> 00:43:38.407
And our guest?

281
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:46.498
As I said, I'm still collating.

282
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:52.129
But I have confirmed that he's got
an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.

283
00:43:52.297 --> 00:43:58.844
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells
and replacing them with polarized silicone,

284
00:43:59.012 --> 00:44:05.017
which gives him a prolonged resistance
to adverse environmental conditions.

285
00:44:05.185 --> 00:44:07.102
Is that enough?

286
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.480
Plenty. What does it mean?

287
00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:14.026
- Please don't do that. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:20.574
It's an interesting combination of elements,
making him a tough little son of a bitch.

289
00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:23.035
And you let him in.

290
00:44:23.203 --> 00:44:25.579
I was obeying a direct order.

291
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:31.919
When Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.

292
00:44:32.087 --> 00:44:34.129
Oh, yes. I forgot.

293
00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:39.093
You also forgot the Science Division's
basic quarantine law.

294
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:43.472
- That I didn't forget.
- I see. You just broke it.

295
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.059
What would you have done with Kane?

296
00:44:47.227 --> 00:44:50.479
You knew his only chance
was to get him in here.

297
00:44:50.647 --> 00:44:54.900
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine,
you risk everybody's life.

298
00:44:55.068 --> 00:44:57.486
Maybe I should have left him outside.

299
00:44:57.654 --> 00:45:02.074
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

300
00:45:02.242 --> 00:45:06.120
It's a pretty big risk for a science officer.

301
00:45:06.287 --> 00:45:09.915
It's not exactly out of the manual.

302
00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:14.712
I take my responsibilities
as seriously as you.

303
00:45:15.964 --> 00:45:19.800
You do your job
and let me do mine.

304
00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:58.672
- Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.

305
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:05.679
Dallas.

306
00:46:05.847 --> 00:46:08.015
You should have a look at Kane.

307
00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:11.351
- Why?
- Something's happened.

308
00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:14.354
- Serious?
- Interesting.

309
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.197
Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.

310
00:46:25.909 --> 00:46:29.119
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

311
00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:33.874
- We have to try and find it.
- Let's check it.

312
00:46:58.775 --> 00:47:01.401
Please be careful.

313
00:47:42.152 --> 00:47:44.444
Sorry.

314
00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:19.813
Not in the corner.

315
00:48:19.981 --> 00:48:23.984
Have one of these. Just in case.

316
00:48:36.414 --> 00:48:38.790
Kane? Dallas?

317
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.505
Are you OK?

318
00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:49.927
- I didn't see it. Was it in the overhead?
- It was up there somewhere.

319
00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:54.264
- My God.
- Cover the damn thing, will you?

320
00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:58.977
- It's alive.
- That's a reflex action.

321
00:49:00.772 --> 00:49:02.731
We've got to have a look at this.

322
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.496
Excuse me.

323
00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:27.714
- It seems dead enough.
- Good. Let's get rid of it.

324
00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:33.679
For God's sake, this is the first time
we've encountered a species like this.

325
00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:36.682
It has to go back,
tests have to be made...

326
00:49:36.849 --> 00:49:41.645
Are you kidding? This thing bled acid.
Who knows what it will do when it's dead?

327
00:49:41.813 --> 00:49:44.898
I think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie.

328
00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:47.776
Dallas, it has to go back.

329
00:49:47.944 --> 00:49:53.115
I'd soon as not burn it at the stake,
but you're the science officer.

330
00:49:53.283 --> 00:49:55.617
- It's your decision.
- Dallas.

331
00:49:56.077 --> 00:49:59.955
- You won't make me change my mind...
- I'm not trying to change your mind.

332
00:50:00.123 --> 00:50:02.749
I just want you to listen...

333
00:50:04.794 --> 00:50:08.922
- How can you leave that decision to him?
- I just run the ship.

334
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.925
Anything scientific, Ash has the final word.

335
00:50:12.093 --> 00:50:15.304
- How does that happen?
- That's what the company wants.

336
00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:20.809
- Since when is that standard procedure?
- Standard procedure is to do what they say.

337
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:26.440
- Did you ever ship out with Ash before?
- I went out five times with another officer.

338
00:50:26.607 --> 00:50:30.694
They replaced him two days before
we left Thedus with Ash.

339
00:50:30.862 --> 00:50:35.240
- I don't trust him.
- I don't trust anybody.

340
00:50:35.408 --> 00:50:39.119
- How are the repairs going?
- They're pretty much finished.

341
00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:42.080
- Why didn't you tell me?
- There's still some things to do.

342
00:50:42.248 --> 00:50:43.915
Like what?

343
00:50:44.083 --> 00:50:48.003
We're blind on B and C decks,
the reserve power system's blown...

344
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:50.797
That's horseshit.
We can take off without that.

345
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:55.260
- You think that's a good idea?
- I just wanna get the hell outta here.

346
00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:22.162
Dust in the intakes.
Number two's overheating.

347
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:24.664
Spit on it for two minutes!

348
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:29.503
We're hot and we're getting hotter.

349
00:51:31.339 --> 00:51:34.049
Engine room, red clip status.

350
00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:38.887
- One kilometer on ascension.
- Engage artificial gravity.

351
00:51:39.055 --> 00:51:42.599
- Engaged.
- I'm altering the vector now.

352
00:51:46.896 --> 00:51:48.980
Inhibit CNG.

353
00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:55.904
- Struts retract.
- Struts retracted.

354
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:19.803
Walk in the park.

355
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:23.056
When we fix something,
it stays fixed, eh, Brett?

356
00:52:23.224 --> 00:52:24.266
Right.

357
00:52:39.782 --> 00:52:43.994
We should freeze him. If he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it there?

358
00:52:44.162 --> 00:52:47.247
- We can get to a doctor back home.
- Right.

359
00:52:47.415 --> 00:52:51.543
Whenever he says anything,
you say "Right". You know that?

360
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:53.378
Right.

361
00:52:53.546 --> 00:52:57.841
Your staff just follows you around
and says "Right"! Like a parrot.

362
00:52:58.009 --> 00:53:01.470
- Shape up. What are you, a parrot?
- Right.

363
00:53:01.637 --> 00:53:03.763
Knock it off.

364
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:07.893
- Kane will have to go into quarantine.
- And so are we.

365
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:12.564
- How about something to lower your spirits?
- Thrill me, will you?

366
00:53:12.732 --> 00:53:16.776
According to my calculations,
based on time spent...

367
00:53:16.944 --> 00:53:20.030
- The short version. How far to Earth?
- Ten months.

368
00:53:20.198 --> 00:53:22.240
- Oh, God.
- Right.

369
00:53:23.284 --> 00:53:24.326
Yes?

370
00:53:24.494 --> 00:53:27.996
- I think you should see Kane.
- Has his condition changed?

371
00:53:28.164 --> 00:53:30.457
- It's simpler if you come.
- We're on our way.

372
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:35.295
Right.

373
00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:40.759
How are you feelin'?

374
00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:47.933
- How are you doing?
- Terrific. Next silly question?

375
00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:53.480
Thank you.

376
00:53:55.524 --> 00:53:59.277
Do you remember anything
about the planet?

377
00:54:00.947 --> 00:54:04.282
What's the last thing you do remember?

378
00:54:10.456 --> 00:54:15.168
I remember some horrible dream
about smothering and...

379
00:54:17.797 --> 00:54:19.589
Anyway, where are we?

380
00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:22.008
- Right here.
- We're on our way home.

381
00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:25.303
Back to the old freezerinos.

382
00:54:26.389 --> 00:54:30.517
- I've got to have something to eat first.
- I need something myself.

383
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:34.187
One more meal before bedtime. I'm buying.

384
00:54:34.355 --> 00:54:36.564
That's a break.

385
00:54:57.086 --> 00:55:01.631
First thing I'm going to do when I get back
is to get some decent food.

386
00:55:01.799 --> 00:55:07.304
I can dig it. I've eaten worse food than this,
but then I've tasted better.

387
00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:10.473
You pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.

388
00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:15.103
I'd rather be eating something else,
but right now I'm thinking food.

389
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:18.898
You should know,
you know what it's made of.

390
00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:23.111
I don't wanna talk about what it's made of.
I'm eating this.

391
00:55:24.488 --> 00:55:28.742
What's the matter?
The food ain't that bad.

392
00:55:29.869 --> 00:55:31.953
What's wrong?

393
00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:36.624
What? What?

394
00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:38.835
This is serious.

395
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:50.972
Get the spoon.

396
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:56.227
- Get it into his mouth.
- I'm trying.

397
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:27.634
Oh, God!

398
00:56:35.768 --> 00:56:37.811
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

399
00:56:56.664 --> 00:56:59.124
- Dallas?
- Yeah.

400
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:03.002
- Anything?
- No. You?

401
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:05.213
Nothing.

402
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:07.882
- Did you see anything?
- No.

403
00:57:43.002 --> 00:57:45.503
Inner hatch sealed.

404
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:51.050
Anybody want to say anything?

405
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:30.590
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.

406
00:58:30.758 --> 00:58:35.470
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated from here to here.

407
00:58:35.638 --> 00:58:39.599
Just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it.

408
00:58:42.144 --> 00:58:46.439
It shouldn't damage the bastard
unless its skin is thinner than ours.

409
00:58:46.607 --> 00:58:50.527
But it will give him a little incentive.

410
00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:52.779
Now we just have to find him.

411
00:58:52.947 --> 00:58:59.786
I've designed this tracking device.
You just set it to search for a moving object.

412
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:05.833
Hasn't got much range, but within
a certain distance, it gives off a signal.

413
00:59:06.001 --> 00:59:09.003
What does it key on?

414
00:59:09.171 --> 00:59:12.966
Micro changes in air density.

415
00:59:13.133 --> 00:59:15.343
Gimme a demo.

416
00:59:17.638 --> 00:59:20.640
See? And again...

417
00:59:20.808 --> 00:59:23.017
Gotcha.

418
00:59:23.185 --> 00:59:28.815
Two teams. Ash, Lambert and I.
Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.

419
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:34.946
Anyone see this thing, you catch it
in the net that Parker is holding.

420
00:59:35.114 --> 00:59:37.865
Parker, I don't want any heroics
out of you, all right?

421
00:59:38.033 --> 00:59:41.077
Catch it, put it in the airlock, get rid of it.

422
00:59:41.245 --> 00:59:47.667
The channels are open on all decks.
I want you to keep in touch at all times.

423
00:59:47.835 --> 00:59:49.877
Let's go.

424
01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:05.977
I thought you fixed 12 module.

425
01:00:06.145 --> 01:00:09.856
We did. I don't understand it.

426
01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:15.361
The circuits must have burned out.

427
01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:30.460
- What have we got here?
- Hold your light over here.

428
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.628
That's it.

429
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.882
I don't know if this will work.

430
01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.720
- Put this in there.
- Right.

431
01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.602
Check the insulation.

432
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.812
Shit...

433
01:01:11.919 --> 01:01:14.837
According to this, it's within five meters.

434
01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:26.766
Micro changes in air density, my ass.

435
01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:33.815
It's within five meters.

436
01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:35.983
Be careful.

437
01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:10.643
- Don't creep up on me with that thing.
- You guys stick together.

438
01:02:27.995 --> 01:02:29.370
What?

439
01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:31.706
It's in this locker.

440
01:02:31.874 --> 01:02:33.499
In where?

441
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.710
Here, take it.

442
01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.047
I got it.

443
01:02:42.718 --> 01:02:44.135
Wait.

444
01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:47.513
All right, when I say.

445
01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:53.686
- All right. Now.
- Easy.

446
01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:02.778
- Don't let him go!
- What the hell are you doing?

447
01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:05.031
It's the cat.

448
01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:15.875
We had to bag it. Now we might
pick it up on the tracker again.

449
01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.838
Go and get it, man.

450
01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:24.383
You get him, we'll go on.

451
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.729
Here, kitty.

452
01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:38.564
Here, kitty, kitty.

453
01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:42.902
Kitty crap. Jones?

454
01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:47.949
Jonesy?

455
01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.909
Here, Jonesy.

456
01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.126
Jonesy?

457
01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:07.301
Here, kitty.

458
01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:15.434
Here, Jonesy.

459
01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.198
Jonesy.

460
01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:42.837
Here, kitty, kitty.

461
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.134
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

462
01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.263
Here, Jonesy.

463
01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:18.849
Jonesy.

464
01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:22.728
Kitty, kitty.

465
01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:13.821
Jonesy?

466
01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:26.459
Come on, Jonesy.
Come on, baby. That's a kitty.

467
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.711
Come on, baby.

468
01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:31.922
That's a kitty.

469
01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:36.802
I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

470
01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:17.593
Whatever it was, it was big.

471
01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.306
You sure it took him into the air shaft?

472
01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:25.059
Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts.

473
01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:29.230
No question.
It's using the air ducts to move around.

474
01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:34.485
Could he want Brett alive?

475
01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:37.863
- What?
- Could Brett be alive?

476
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:41.116
No. I mean, l don't think so.

477
01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:44.787
This air shaft may work to our advantage.

478
01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:52.086
It comes out in the main airlock.
There's only one big opening along the way.

479
01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:58.384
We can cover that up and then we drive it
into the airlock and zap it into outer space.

480
01:08:58.552 --> 01:09:00.886
The son of a bitch is huge.

481
01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.305
It's like a man. It's big.

482
01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.349
Kane's son.

483
01:09:06.726 --> 01:09:11.313
Come on, Ash. The science department
should be able to help. How can we drive it?

484
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:15.568
It's adapted well to our atmosphere,
considering its nutritional needs.

485
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.736
But we don't know about temperature.

486
01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:21.427
- OK, temperature. What if we change it?
- Let's try it.

487
01:09:21.504 --> 01:09:24.827
Most animals retreat from fire.

488
01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:29.748
Fire, yeah. Parker, can you rig
three or four incinerator units?

489
01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:33.377
Give me 20 minutes, I'll do it.

490
01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.796
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.

491
01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.507
No.

492
01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:43.178
You and Ash, take the main airlock.

493
01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:47.975
Parker, Lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening.

494
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.952
- I'm at the first junction.
- I'm right here.

495
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.204
- Parker?
- Yeah.

496
01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:36.208
- Lambert?
- In position. I'm trying to get a reading.

497
01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:39.044
- The airlock is open.
- Okay, Ripley.

498
01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.838
Ready.

499
01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.976
I've got a reading on you now.

500
01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:33.807
Open the hatch to the third junction.

501
01:12:50.742 --> 01:12:52.326
OK, I'm through.

502
01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:54.078
- Ripley?
- Yes.

503
01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:57.122
Close all the hatches behind me.

504
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.333
I'm moving on.

505
01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:16.725
Dallas, hold on. I think I got it.

506
01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:20.062
- Yes, I've got it.
- Where?

507
01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.525
It's somewhere around the third junction.

508
01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:27.152
OK. Moving on.

509
01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:50.926
It is right around there.
You'll have to be careful.

510
01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:07.943
All right. I've reached the third junction
and I'm going down.

511
01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.631
What the hell's the matter with that box?

512
01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:33.927
Dallas, hold your position for a minute.

513
01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:37.639
- I've lost the signal!
- What?

514
01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:38.974
You sure?

515
01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:44.229
Are you sure it's not there?
It's got to be around there.

516
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.236
Check that out.
You may be getting interference.

517
01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:54.489
Are you sure there's no sign of it?
It is there.

518
01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.785
It's gotta be around there.

519
01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:01.163
Dallas?

520
01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:07.628
All right.

521
01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:16.136
Am I clear? I wanna get outta here.

522
01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.933
Oh, God! It's moving right towards you.

523
01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:32.986
Move, get out of there! Move!

524
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.449
Move, Dallas! Get out!

525
01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:42.120
No, the other way!

526
01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:45.749
Dallas?

527
01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:48.961
- No.
- Take it easy. Dallas?

528
01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.970
We found this laying there.

529
01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:00.806
No blood.

530
01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:03.475
No Dallas.

531
01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:06.561
Nothing.

532
01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:15.654
- I don't hear anybody sayin' nothing.
- I'm thinking.

533
01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:23.620
Unless somebody has a better idea,
we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.

534
01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:29.543
What? And end up like the others?
You're out of your mind.

535
01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:34.006
- You got a better idea?
- I say that we abandon the ship.

536
01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:41.054
We get the shuttle and get the hell out
of here, and hope somebody picks us up.

537
01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:45.434
- The shuttle won't take four.
- Then why don't we draw straws?

538
01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.562
I'm not drawing any straws.
I'm for killing it now.

539
01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:54.109
OK. Let's talk about killing it.
It's in the air shafts...

540
01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:57.070
Will you listen to me? Shut up!

541
01:16:57.238 --> 01:17:00.699
Let's hear it. Let's hear it.

542
01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:04.369
- It's using the air shafts.
- We don't know that...

543
01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:08.623
That's the only way.
We'll move in pairs.

544
01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:12.377
We'll go step by step
and cut off every bulkhead and vent

545
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:16.673
until we have it cornered,
then we'll blow it the fuck out into space.

546
01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:18.884
Is that acceptable to you?

547
01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:20.635
If it means killing it, yeah.

548
01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:23.221
Obviously it means killing it.

549
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.224
But we have to stick together.

550
01:17:27.435 --> 01:17:32.439
- How are our weapons?
- Fine. This one needs refueling.

551
01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.900
Will you get it, please?

552
01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:38.695
- Ash, go with him.
- I can manage.

553
01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:40.906
Don't follow me.

554
01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:45.702
Ash?

555
01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:50.832
Any suggestions from you or Mother?

556
01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:54.544
We're still collating.

557
01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:59.966
You're what? You're still collating?

558
01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:04.304
I find that hard to believe.

559
01:18:05.807 --> 01:18:10.519
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you've been doing. Nothing.

560
01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:16.608
I've got access to Mother now,
and I'll get my own answers, thank you.

561
01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.778
All right.

562
01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:13.975
There is an explanation for this.

563
01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:17.771
I don't wanna hear
your goddamn explanation.

564
01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:44.547
Parker? Lambert?

565
01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:53.974
Ash.

566
01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:56.059
Open the door.

567
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.153
Ash.

568
01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:14.119
Will you open the door?

569
01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:20.000
Let me by.

570
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.541
What the hell are you doing?

571
01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.603
Get her up.

572
01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:18.827
It's an android!

573
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.760
Jesus...

574
01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:42.100
It's a robot.
Ash is a goddamn robot.

575
01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:45.937
God.

576
01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.446
Holy shit.

577
01:23:55.865 --> 01:23:57.699
Help me get this fucking thing off.

578
01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:07.584
God... Jesus...

579
01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:09.961
Oh, God.

580
01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:16.593
How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?

581
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.597
They must have wanted the alien
for the weapons division.

582
01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:23.266
He's been protecting it all along.

583
01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:27.854
- Will you plug it in?
- I don't know...

584
01:24:28.022 --> 01:24:31.482
Because he may know how to kill it.

585
01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.595
Ash, can you hear me?

586
01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:05.099
Ash!

587
01:25:13.067 --> 01:25:15.568
I can hear you.

588
01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:22.283
What was your special order?

589
01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:25.495
You read it. I thought it was clear.

590
01:25:25.663 --> 01:25:31.376
- What was it?
- Bring back life form, priority one.

591
01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:34.462
All other priorities rescinded.

592
01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:41.886
The damn company.
What about our lives, you son of a bitch?

593
01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:45.848
I repeat, all other priorities are rescinded.

594
01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:50.520
How do we kill it?
There's gotta be a way of killing it.

595
01:25:50.688 --> 01:25:53.815
- How do we do it?
- You can't.

596
01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:56.526
That's bullshit.

597
01:25:56.694 --> 01:26:01.781
You still don't understand
what you're dealing with, do you?

598
01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:04.575
The perfect organism.

599
01:26:07.121 --> 01:26:11.916
Its structural perfection
is matched only by its hostility.

600
01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:14.168
You admire it.

601
01:26:17.298 --> 01:26:20.008
I admire its purity.

602
01:26:23.262 --> 01:26:25.555
A survivor,

603
01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:33.313
unclouded by conscience, remorse,

604
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.815
or delusions of morality.

605
01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:41.904
I've heard enough of this
and I'm asking you to pull the plug.

606
01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:44.866
Last word.

607
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:52.040
I can't lie to you about your chances, but...

608
01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:57.962
you have my sympathies.

609
01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:05.928
We're gonna blow up the ship.
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.

610
01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.639
- Blow up the ship.
- Good.

611
01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.850
Come on.

612
01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:39.837
When we throw the switches,
how long do we have?

613
01:27:40.005 --> 01:27:41.881
- Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.

614
01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:46.969
Or we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

615
01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:51.140
We'll need coolant
for the air support system.

616
01:28:02.403 --> 01:28:07.156
You two get all the coolant you can carry.
I'll get the shuttle ready.

617
01:28:07.324 --> 01:28:10.535
I'll give you about seven minutes.

618
01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:16.916
Come back up here, I'll shut the switches off
and we'll blow this fucker off into space.

619
01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:18.835
- Ready?
- Take care of yourself.

620
01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:21.254
Seven minutes.

621
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.376
Take it easy.

622
01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:55.056
Jones?

623
01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:31.259
Okay, check the bottles.

624
01:30:44.815 --> 01:30:46.357
Jones.

625
01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:53.739
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

626
01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:58.536
OK, go ahead.

627
01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:01.539
Jones?

628
01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:09.463
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

629
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.799
Come here, Jones.

630
01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:13.384
Jones.

631
01:31:18.307 --> 01:31:21.100
Come here, boy.

632
01:31:22.352 --> 01:31:24.437
Nice kitty.

633
01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:26.188
Jones?

634
01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:29.275
Jones.

635
01:31:33.614 --> 01:31:36.616
Come here, sweetheart.

636
01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:59.930
Jones.

637
01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:02.391
Goddamn it.

638
01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:07.688
Now I've got you.

639
01:32:13.362 --> 01:32:16.322
Come on, sweetheart. Nice kitty.

640
01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:41.055
Oh, my God...

641
01:32:41.848 --> 01:32:44.975
- Get out of the way.
- I can't.

642
01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:47.978
Get out of the way! It's gonna kill us!

643
01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:49.980
I can't!

644
01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:53.359
- For Christ sake, get out of the way!
- Parker? Lambert?

645
01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:06.288
Get out of the way!

646
01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:11.460
Lambert? Lambert.

647
01:33:41.908 --> 01:33:44.285
Get ready to roll!

648
01:34:21.907 --> 01:34:23.365
Parker?

649
01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.752
Danger.

650
01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:03.799
The emergency destruct system
is now activated.

651
01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:09.847
The ship will detonate
in T minus ten minutes.

652
01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:18.272
The option to override automatic detonation
expires in T minus five minutes.

653
01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:26.090
The option to override automatic detonation
expires in T minus three minutes.

654
01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:09.758
The option to override automatic detonation
expires in T minus one minute.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.222
1.

671
01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:03.395
The option to override detonation procedure
has now expired.

672
01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:08.609
Mother! I've turned
the cooling unit back on.

673
01:39:08.777 --> 01:39:10.694
Mother!

674
01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:18.035
The ship will automatically destruct
in T minus five minutes.

675
01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:21.580
You bitch!

676
01:39:40.391 --> 01:39:42.476
Goddamn it.

677
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:14.651
Jones.

678
01:42:00.156 --> 01:42:04.826
You now have one minute
to abandon ship.

679
01:42:04.994 --> 01:42:10.874
The ship will automatically destruct
in T minus one minute.

680
01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:39.236
T minus 30 seconds.

681

01:43:08.224 --> 01:43:10.392
7, 6,

693
01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.561
5, 4,

694
01:43:12.729 --> 01:43:15.564
3, 2, 1.

695
01:44:04.197 --> 01:44:06.698
I got you,

696
01:44:08.201 --> 01:44:10.577
you son of a bitch.

697
01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:56.873
It's all right.

698
01:45:21.524 --> 01:45:24.401
All right, it's nice to see you, too.

699
01:45:26.487 --> 01:45:28.405
It's OK.

700
01:49:59.593 --> 01:50:00.677
Come on.

701
01:50:00.845 --> 01:50:13.606
You are my lucky star.

702
01:50:15.317 --> 01:50:19.195
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

703
01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:21.114
OK.

704
01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:30.707
Come on.

705
01:50:30.875 --> 01:50:36.504
You are my lucky star.

706
01:50:37.756 --> 01:50:40.967
You are...

707
01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.846
my lucky star.

708
01:50:45.389 --> 01:50:49.559
You are my lucky star.

709
01:50:49.727 --> 01:50:53.563
You are my lucky...

710
01:52:40.504 --> 01:52:44.507
Final report
of the commercial starship Nostromo.

711
01:52:44.675 --> 01:52:47.468
Third Officer reporting.

712
01:52:47.636 --> 01:52:50.680
The other members of the crew -

713
01:52:50.848 --> 01:52:59.731
Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash
and Captain Dallas - are dead.

714
01:53:00.441 --> 01:53:03.026
Cargo and ship destroyed.

715
01:53:04.236 --> 01:53:07.947
I should reach the frontier
in about six weeks.

716
01:53:08.115 --> 01:53:11.784
With a little luck,
the network will pick me up.

717
01:53:11.952 --> 01:53:17.290
This is Ripley,
last survivor of the Nostromo,

718
01:53:17.458 --> 01:53:19.500
signing off.

719
01:53:26.508 --> 01:53:28.593
Come on, cat.

720
01:56:33.070 --> 01:56:34.070
[ENGLISH - US]

721
01:56:37.741 --> 01:56:40.368
Get dressed, huh? Parker?

722
01:56:40.536 --> 01:56:43.871
I haven't finished my coffee.
It's the only good thing we got.

723
01:57:15.028 --> 01:57:16.946
I can't believe this.

724
01:57:17.114 --> 01:57:19.740
Contact traffic control.

725
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:23.619
This is commercial towing vehicle
Nostromo,

726
01:57:23.787 --> 01:57:28.916
out of the Solomons,
registration number 180924609,

727
01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:33.546
calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me?

728
01:57:33.714 --> 01:57:36.841
Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo,
out of the Solomons,

729
01:57:37.009 --> 01:57:41.929
registration number 180924609.

730
01:57:43.557 --> 01:57:46.017
You got that?

731
01:57:46.184 --> 01:57:48.936
- Well, yeah.
- We're going in.

732
01:57:49.104 --> 01:57:50.813
We're going in.

733
01:57:58.238 --> 01:58:00.990
Can we all hear that, Lambert?

734
01:58:22.846 --> 01:58:26.891
- Good God.
- Doesn't sound like any radio signal I know.

735
01:58:27.059 --> 01:58:32.104
- Maybe it's a voice.
- We'll soon know. Can you home in on that?

736
01:58:32.272 --> 01:58:34.940
What was the position?

737
01:58:35.108 --> 01:58:39.570
6550-99.

738
01:58:45.243 --> 01:58:47.370
All right, it found the quadrant.

739
01:58:47.537 --> 01:58:55.044
Ascension: six minutes, 20 seconds.
Declination: 39 degrees, two seconds.

740
01:58:55.212 --> 01:58:57.963
OK. Put that on the screen.

741
01:59:01.927 --> 01:59:03.969
All right, that's it.

742
01:59:04.137 --> 01:59:07.932
It's a planetoid. 1200 kilometers.

743
01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:10.768
- It's tiny.
- Any rotation?

744
01:59:13.313 --> 01:59:16.357
- About two hours.
- What about gravity?

745
01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.694
0.86.

746
01:59:21.947 --> 01:59:24.323
You can walk on it.

747
01:59:33.625 --> 01:59:37.586
Approaching orbital apogee. Mark.

748
01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.591
Equatorial orbit nailed.

749
01:59:57.983 --> 01:59:59.733
DOR's in line.

750
01:59:59.901 --> 02:00:03.737
- Status on the lifters?
- Give me an AC pressure reading.

751
02:00:10.162 --> 02:00:12.872
48 seconds and counting.

752
02:00:15.542 --> 02:00:18.127
Prepare to disengage from platform.

753
02:00:18.295 --> 02:00:20.296
20 seconds.

754
02:00:20.464 --> 02:00:23.007
18, 17...

755
02:00:23.175 --> 02:00:30.055
13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7,

756
02:00:30.223 --> 02:00:35.853
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

757
02:00:36.021 --> 02:00:37.396
Lock.

758
02:00:37.564 --> 02:00:39.398
Disengage.

759
02:00:44.488 --> 02:00:45.696
Clear.

760
02:00:51.328 --> 02:00:54.330
Money's safe.
Let's take her down.

761
02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:05.966
- Roll 92 degrees, port yaw.
- Prime the port.

762
02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.957
I'm not getting anything.

763
02:01:46.341 --> 02:01:48.801
Can't see a goddamn thing.

764
02:01:48.969 --> 02:01:50.970
Quit griping.

765
02:01:51.137 --> 02:01:53.806
- I like griping.
- Knock it off.

766
02:03:19.142 --> 02:03:22.770
- Ash, can you see this?
- I can.

767
02:03:25.857 --> 02:03:28.776
I've never seen anything like it.

768
02:03:36.785 --> 02:03:39.161
It's very bizarre.

769
02:03:53.385 --> 02:03:55.344
All right.

770
02:03:55.512 --> 02:03:58.555
Moving on to second position.

771
02:03:58.723 --> 02:04:00.766
What is it?

772
02:04:03.019 --> 02:04:04.978
Let's get outta here.

773
02:04:05.146 --> 02:04:08.649
We've got this far. We have to go on.

774
02:04:12.779 --> 02:04:15.239
Will you say that again?

775
02:04:15.407 --> 02:04:16.448
Shit.

776
02:04:17.826 --> 02:04:21.745
As you can see, it's hard to describe.

777
02:04:21.913 --> 02:04:24.540
I'm going back to the console.

778
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:12.963
Dallas?

779
02:06:06.017 --> 02:06:09.478
Come on down here.
There's something different.

780
02:06:09.646 --> 02:06:15.609
I don't know what it is, but if we can
get up that wall, we can find out.

781
02:07:24.512 --> 02:07:27.806
Alien life form.

782
02:07:27.974 --> 02:07:30.976
It looks like it's been dead a long time.

783
02:07:31.144 --> 02:07:33.687
Fossilised.

784
02:07:33.855 --> 02:07:37.107
Looks like it's grown out of the chair.

785
02:07:47.201 --> 02:07:49.328
Bones are bent outward.

786
02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:52.497
Like he exploded from inside.

787
02:07:54.417 --> 02:07:58.045
Wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.

788
02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:04.760
Let's get the hell outta here.

789
02:08:16.147 --> 02:08:17.564
Hey, Dallas.

790
02:08:17.732 --> 02:08:20.901
Lambert, come on over here.

791
02:08:21.903 --> 02:08:23.570
Come on.

792
02:08:28.576 --> 02:08:32.537
- What have you got?
- See what you make of this.

793
02:08:40.004 --> 02:08:44.174
Ash, that transmission.
Mother's deciphered part of it.

794
02:08:44.342 --> 02:08:47.094
- It doesn't look like an SOS.
- What is it, then?

795
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:50.514
It looks like a warning.

796
02:08:50.682 --> 02:08:54.726
- I'm gonna go out after them.
- What's the point?

797
02:08:56.187 --> 02:09:01.942
By the time it takes to get there,
they'll know if it's a warning or not.

798
02:09:29.053 --> 02:09:31.763
Are you OK down there?

799
02:09:35.268 --> 02:09:41.398
- Can you see anything?
- A cave of some sort, but I...

800
02:09:43.985 --> 02:09:47.362
It's like the goddamn tropics in here.

801
02:09:49.866 --> 02:09:52.492
What the hell is this?

802
02:10:20.313 --> 02:10:23.440
The pit is completely enclosed.

803
02:10:23.608 --> 02:10:29.279
It's full of leathery objects,
like eggs or something.

804
02:10:47.632 --> 02:10:53.595
There's a layer of mist covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.

805
02:10:57.433 --> 02:11:00.310
Kane? Are you all right?

806
02:11:00.478 --> 02:11:02.521
I'm OK.

807
02:11:05.316 --> 02:11:07.692
I'm OK. I just slipped.

808
02:11:27.755 --> 02:11:30.882
It appears to be completely sealed.

809
02:12:05.168 --> 02:12:08.753
Wait, there's movement.

810
02:12:08.921 --> 02:12:12.591
It seems to have organic life.

811
02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.829
What the hell is that?

812
02:12:43.998 --> 02:12:47.417
Jesus Christ.

813
02:12:49.045 --> 02:12:51.129
What is that?

814
02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:57.344
- How the hell's he breathing?
- He still alive or what?

815
02:12:57.511 --> 02:13:00.889
And why don't you guys freeze him?

816
02:13:01.057 --> 02:13:04.559
How come they don't freeze him?
What's going on in there?

817
02:13:04.727 --> 02:13:06.937
- What the fuck is going on?
- You bitch!

818
02:13:07.104 --> 02:13:09.314
Jesus Christ.

819
02:13:09.482 --> 02:13:12.400
- You were gonna leave us out there.
- Break it up.

820
02:13:12.568 --> 02:13:16.571
When l give an order,
I expect to be obeyed.

821
02:13:16.739 --> 02:13:20.241
- Even if it's against the law?
- You're goddamn right.

822
02:13:20.409 --> 02:13:23.244
She has a point.
Who the hell knows what that is?

823
02:13:23.412 --> 02:13:26.247
How are we gonna get that off him?

824
02:13:26.415 --> 02:13:31.086
- How do we get it off?
- Just a minute. I'll get some instruments.

825
02:13:38.052 --> 02:13:41.930
Right. If I make an incision here

826
02:13:42.098 --> 02:13:45.392
to try and remove
one of the digits from his face...

827
02:13:45.559 --> 02:13:47.435
You're gonna do what?

828
02:13:47.603 --> 02:13:50.605
Finger. I'll try and get this finger off.

829
02:13:50.773 --> 02:13:53.525
Get this cleating on there...

830
02:13:56.487 --> 02:13:59.489
- It's tearing his scalp.
- I know.

831
02:14:00.616 --> 02:14:03.535
It's not coming off
without tearing his face off with it.

832
02:14:04.495 --> 02:14:06.997
We'll have to take a look at him inside.

833
02:15:10.519 --> 02:15:13.146
It's amazing. What is it?

834
02:15:14.648 --> 02:15:16.733
I'd say it's...

835
02:15:18.027 --> 02:15:20.320
I don't know yet.

836
02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:27.619
- Do you want something?
- Yes, I...

837
02:15:30.081 --> 02:15:32.874
A little talk. How's Kane?

838
02:15:33.042 --> 02:15:35.460
He's holding. No changes.

839
02:15:35.628 --> 02:15:38.630
And our guest?

840
02:15:43.344 --> 02:15:46.721
As I said, I'm still collating.

841
02:15:46.889 --> 02:15:52.352
But I have confirmed that he's got
an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.

842
02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:59.067
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells
and replacing them with polarized silicone,

843
02:15:59.235 --> 02:16:05.240
which gives him a prolonged resistance
to adverse environmental conditions.

844
02:16:05.407 --> 02:16:07.325
Is that enough?

845
02:16:07.493 --> 02:16:09.702
Plenty. What does it mean?

846
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:14.249
- Please don't do that. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

847
02:16:14.416 --> 02:16:20.797
It's an interesting combination of elements,
making him a tough little son of a bitch.

848
02:16:20.965 --> 02:16:23.258
And you let him in.

849
02:16:23.425 --> 02:16:25.802
I was obeying a direct order.

850
02:16:26.512 --> 02:16:32.142
When Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.

851
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:34.352
Oh, yes. I forgot.

852
02:16:35.229 --> 02:16:39.315
You also forgot the Science Division's
basic quarantine law.

853
02:16:39.483 --> 02:16:43.695
- That I didn't forget.
- I see. You just broke it.

854
02:16:43.863 --> 02:16:47.282
What would you have done with Kane?

855
02:16:47.449 --> 02:16:50.702
You knew his only chance
was to get him in here.

856
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:55.123
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine,
you risk everybody's life.

857
02:16:55.291 --> 02:16:57.709
Maybe I should have left him outside.

858
02:16:57.877 --> 02:17:02.297
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

859
02:17:02.464 --> 02:17:06.342
It's a pretty big risk for a science officer.

860
02:17:06.510 --> 02:17:10.138
It's not exactly out of the manual.

861
02:17:11.432 --> 02:17:14.934
I take my responsibilities
as seriously as you.

862
02:17:16.187 --> 02:17:20.023
You do your job
and let me do mine.

863
02:17:40.252 --> 02:17:42.503
- Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.

864
02:17:48.510 --> 02:17:49.552
Dallas.

865
02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:51.888
You should have a look at Kane.

866
02:17:52.056 --> 02:17:55.225
- Why?
- Something's happened.

867
02:17:55.392 --> 02:17:58.186
- Serious?
- Interesting.

868
02:18:03.192 --> 02:18:07.028
Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.

869
02:18:09.031 --> 02:18:13.159
- You won't make me change my mind...
- I'm not trying to change your mind.

870
02:18:13.327 --> 02:18:15.912
I just want you to listen...

871
02:18:17.998 --> 02:18:22.126
- How can you leave that decision to him?
- I just run the ship.

872
02:18:22.294 --> 02:18:25.129
Anything scientific, Ash has the final word.

873
02:18:25.297 --> 02:18:28.508
- How does that happen?
- That's what the company wants.

874
02:18:28.676 --> 02:18:34.013
- Since when is that standard procedure?
- Standard procedure is to do what they say.

875
02:18:34.181 --> 02:18:37.934
- How are the repairs going?
- They're pretty much finished.

876
02:18:38.102 --> 02:18:40.853
- Why didn't you tell me?
- There's still some things to do.

877
02:18:41.021 --> 02:18:42.689
Like what?

878
02:18:42.856 --> 02:18:46.776
We're blind on B and C decks,
the reserve power system's blown...

879
02:18:46.944 --> 02:18:49.570
That's horseshit.
We can take off without that.

880
02:18:49.738 --> 02:18:54.033
- You think that's a good idea?
- I just wanna get the hell outta here.

881
02:19:18.392 --> 02:19:20.977
Dust in the intakes.
Number two's overheating.

882
02:19:21.145 --> 02:19:23.438
Spit on it for two minutes!

883
02:19:24.315 --> 02:19:28.318
We're hot and we're getting hotter.

884
02:19:30.112 --> 02:19:32.822
Engine room, red clip status.

885
02:19:33.741 --> 02:19:37.660
- One kilometer on ascension.
- Engage artificial gravity.

886
02:19:37.828 --> 02:19:41.372
- Engaged.
- I'm altering the vector now.

887
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:47.754
Inhibit CNG.

888
02:19:50.841 --> 02:19:54.677
- Struts retract.
- Struts retracted.

889
02:20:17.034 --> 02:20:18.576
Walk in the park.

890
02:20:18.744 --> 02:20:21.871
When we fix something,
it stays fixed, eh, Brett?

891
02:20:22.039 --> 02:20:23.039
Right.

892
02:20:38.555 --> 02:20:42.767
We should freeze him. If he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it there?

893
02:20:42.935 --> 02:20:46.062
- We can get to a doctor back home.
- Right.

894
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:50.316
Whenever he says anything,
you say "Right". You know that?

895
02:20:50.484 --> 02:20:52.151
Right.

896
02:20:52.319 --> 02:20:56.614
Your staff just follows you around
and says "Right"! Like a parrot.

897
02:20:56.782 --> 02:21:00.243
- Shape up. What are you, a parrot?
- Right.

898
02:21:00.411 --> 02:21:02.578
Knock it off.

899
02:21:02.746 --> 02:21:06.666
- Kane will have to go into quarantine.
- And so are we.

900
02:21:06.834 --> 02:21:11.337
- How about something to lower your spirits?
- Thrill me, will you?

901
02:21:11.505 --> 02:21:15.550
According to my calculations,
based on time spent...

902
02:21:15.717 --> 02:21:18.803
- The short version. How far to Earth?
- Ten months.

903
02:21:18.971 --> 02:21:21.013
- Oh, God.
- Right.

904
02:21:22.099 --> 02:21:23.099
Yes?

905
02:21:23.267 --> 02:21:26.769
- I think you should see Kane.
- Has his condition changed?

906
02:21:26.937 --> 02:21:29.230
- It's simpler if you come.
- We're on our way.

907
02:21:44.997 --> 02:21:48.708
- Anything?
- No. You?

908
02:21:48.876 --> 02:21:50.918
Nothing.

909
02:21:51.086 --> 02:21:53.588
- Did you see anything?
- No.

910
02:22:15.611 --> 02:22:18.112
Inner hatch sealed.

911
02:22:21.116 --> 02:22:23.659
Anybody want to say anything?

912
02:22:59.488 --> 02:23:03.199
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.

913
02:23:03.367 --> 02:23:08.079
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated from here to here.

914
02:23:08.247 --> 02:23:12.124
Just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it.

915
02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:17.755
I thought you fixed 12 module.

916
02:23:17.923 --> 02:23:21.592
We did. I don't understand it.

917
02:23:24.096 --> 02:23:27.098
The circuits must have burned out.

918
02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:42.238
- What have we got here?
- Hold your light over here.

919
02:23:42.406 --> 02:23:44.407
That's it.

920
02:23:44.574 --> 02:23:47.660
I don't know if this will work.

921
02:23:49.913 --> 02:23:52.498
- Put this in there.
- Right.

922
02:23:57.004 --> 02:23:59.380
Check the insulation.

923
02:23:59.548 --> 02:24:01.590
Shit...

924
02:24:23.697 --> 02:24:26.615
According to this, it's within five meters.

925
02:24:31.747 --> 02:24:35.166
Micro changes in air density, my ass.

926
02:24:39.921 --> 02:24:42.214
It's within five meters.

927
02:24:42.382 --> 02:24:44.383
Be careful.

928
02:24:54.353 --> 02:24:59.857
- Don't creep up on me with that thing.
- You guys stick together.

929
02:25:17.209 --> 02:25:18.626
What?

930
02:25:18.794 --> 02:25:20.961
It's in this locker.

931
02:25:21.129 --> 02:25:22.755
In where?

932
02:25:22.923 --> 02:25:24.965
Here, take it.

933
02:25:27.219 --> 02:25:29.303
I got it.

934
02:25:31.973 --> 02:25:33.391
Wait.

935
02:25:34.184 --> 02:25:36.769
All right, when I say.

936
02:25:39.898 --> 02:25:42.942
- All right. Now.
- Easy.

937
02:25:48.615 --> 02:25:52.034
- Don't let him go!
- What the hell are you doing?

938
02:25:52.202 --> 02:25:54.245
It's the cat.

939
02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:05.131
We had to bag it.
Now we might pick it up on the tracker again.

940
02:26:07.551 --> 02:26:10.094
Go and get it, man.

941
02:26:10.262 --> 02:26:13.597
You get him, we'll go on.

942
02:26:23.567 --> 02:26:25.943
Here, kitty.

943
02:26:26.111 --> 02:26:27.820
Here, kitty, kitty.

944
02:26:29.448 --> 02:26:32.116
Kitty crap. Jones?

945
02:26:35.287 --> 02:26:37.204
Jonesy?

946
02:26:37.372 --> 02:26:39.165
Here, Jonesy.

947
02:26:47.007 --> 02:26:48.382
Jonesy?

948
02:26:54.181 --> 02:26:56.557
Here, kitty.

949
02:27:03.064 --> 02:27:04.690
Here, Jonesy.

950
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:18.454
Jonesy.

951
02:27:30.509 --> 02:27:32.092
Here, kitty, kitty.

952
02:28:59.931 --> 02:29:01.390
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

953
02:29:03.893 --> 02:29:05.519
Here, Jonesy.

954
02:29:06.438 --> 02:29:08.105
Jonesy.

955
02:29:10.609 --> 02:29:11.942
Kitty, kitty.

956
02:29:46.603 --> 02:29:48.520
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

957
02:29:52.484 --> 02:29:54.068
Jonesy?

958
02:30:02.661 --> 02:30:06.705
Come on, Jonesy.
Come on, baby. That's a kitty.

959
02:30:06.873 --> 02:30:08.957
Come on, baby.

960
02:30:10.251 --> 02:30:12.169
That's a kitty.

961
02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:17.049
I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

962
02:30:49.541 --> 02:30:52.251
- Brett!
- Brett!

963
02:31:00.176 --> 02:31:02.219
Brett!

964
02:31:11.312 --> 02:31:14.231
Whatever it was, it was big.

965
02:31:17.318 --> 02:31:18.902
You sure it took him into the air shaft?

966
02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:21.697
Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts.

967
02:31:21.865 --> 02:31:25.826
No question.
It's using the air ducts to move around.

968
02:31:26.786 --> 02:31:28.579
No.

969
02:31:28.747 --> 02:31:33.250
You and Ash, take the main airlock.

970
02:31:33.418 --> 02:31:38.046
Parker, Lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening.

971
02:32:08.787 --> 02:32:12.456
- I'm at the first junction.
- I'm right here.

972
02:32:12.624 --> 02:32:14.750
- Parker?
- Yeah.

973
02:32:14.918 --> 02:32:18.754
- Lambert?
- In position. I'm trying to get a reading.

974
02:32:18.922 --> 02:32:21.590
- The airlock is open.
- Okay, Ripley.

975
02:32:21.758 --> 02:32:23.342
Ready.

976
02:32:33.728 --> 02:32:36.480
I've got a reading on you now.

977
02:32:52.580 --> 02:32:55.415
Open the hatch to the third junction.

978
02:33:12.350 --> 02:33:13.934
OK, I'm through.

979
02:33:14.102 --> 02:33:15.686
- Ripley?
- Yes.

980
02:33:15.854 --> 02:33:18.730
Close all the hatches behind me.

981
02:33:18.898 --> 02:33:20.941
I'm moving on.

982
02:33:35.540 --> 02:33:38.333
Dallas, hold on. I think I got it.

983
02:33:38.501 --> 02:33:41.670
- Yes, I've got it.
- Where?

984
02:33:43.172 --> 02:33:46.133
It's somewhere around the third junction.

985
02:33:46.301 --> 02:33:48.719
OK. Moving on.

986
02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:12.534
It is right around there.
You'll have to be careful.

987
02:34:22.086 --> 02:34:27.090
- How are our weapons?
- Fine. This one needs refueling.

988
02:34:27.258 --> 02:34:29.509
Will you get it, please?

989
02:34:29.677 --> 02:34:33.347
- Ash, go with him.
- I can manage.

990
02:34:33.514 --> 02:34:35.557
Don't follow me.

991
02:34:38.895 --> 02:34:40.354
Ash?

992
02:34:42.357 --> 02:34:45.484
Any suggestions from you or Mother?

993
02:34:46.778 --> 02:34:49.196
We're still collating.

994
02:34:50.406 --> 02:34:54.618
You're what? You're still collating?

995
02:34:56.204 --> 02:34:58.956
I find that hard to believe.

996
02:35:00.458 --> 02:35:05.170
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you've been doing. Nothing.

997
02:35:05.338 --> 02:35:11.218
I've got access to Mother now,
and I'll get my own answers, thank you.

998
02:35:12.345 --> 02:35:14.429
All right.

999
02:36:52.737 --> 02:36:56.615
There is an explanation for this.

1000
02:36:56.783 --> 02:37:00.410
I don't wanna hear
your goddamn explanation.

1001
02:37:17.428 --> 02:37:20.514
Parker? Lambert?

1002
02:37:28.898 --> 02:37:29.940
Ash.

1003
02:37:30.858 --> 02:37:32.025
Open the door.

1004
02:37:41.577 --> 02:37:43.120
Ash.

1005
02:37:47.375 --> 02:37:50.043
Will you open the door?

1006
02:37:53.881 --> 02:37:56.007
Let me by.

1007
02:37:59.595 --> 02:38:02.556
How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?

1008
02:38:02.723 --> 02:38:06.560
They must have wanted the alien
for the weapons division.

1009
02:38:06.727 --> 02:38:09.229
He's been protecting it all along.

1010
02:38:09.397 --> 02:38:13.817
- Will you plug it in?
- I don't know...

1011
02:38:13.985 --> 02:38:17.445
Because he may know how to kill it.

1012
02:38:41.846 --> 02:38:44.306
Ash, can you hear me?

1013
02:38:47.476 --> 02:38:50.020
When we throw the switches,
how long do we have?

1014
02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:52.063
- Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.

1015
02:38:52.231 --> 02:38:57.152
Or we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

1016
02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:01.323
We'll need coolant
for the air support system.

1017
02:39:05.995 --> 02:39:10.749
You two get all the coolant you can carry.
I'll get the shuttle ready.

1018
02:39:10.917 --> 02:39:14.127
I'll give you about seven minutes.

1019
02:39:14.295 --> 02:39:20.508
Come back up here, I'll shut the switches off
and we'll blow this fucker off into space.

1020
02:39:20.676 --> 02:39:22.427
- Ready?
- Take care of yourself.

1021
02:39:22.595 --> 02:39:24.846
Seven minutes.

1022
02:39:47.078 --> 02:39:49.162
Take it easy.

1023
02:39:53.334 --> 02:40:42.257
Jones?

1024
02:41:12.705 --> 02:41:14.748
Okay, check the bottles.

1025
02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:31.491
Dallas?

1026
02:42:37.832 --> 02:42:39.916
Brett.

1027
02:42:48.926 --> 02:42:51.427
Kill me.

1028
02:42:52.555 --> 02:42:56.099
Kill me...

1029
02:44:04.919 --> 02:44:13.801
The option to override automatic detonation
expires in T minus three minutes.

1030
02:44:51.423 --> 02:45:00.598
The option to override automatic detonation
expires in T minus one minute.

1031
02:45:55.237 --> 02:45:56.821
Jones.

1032
02:46:40.824 --> 02:46:45.495
You now have one minute
to abandon ship.

1033
02:46:45.662 --> 02:46:51.542
The ship will automatically destruct
in T minus one minute.

1034
02:47:12.856 --> 02:47:16.651
T minus 30 seconds.

1035
02:47:16.819 --> 02:47:19.654
29, 28,

1036
02:47:19.822 --> 02:47:21.823
27, 26,

1037
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:24.909
25, 24,

1038
02:47:25.077 --> 02:47:27.912
23, 22,

1039
