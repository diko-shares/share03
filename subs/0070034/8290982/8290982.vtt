00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.431
[grunting]

2
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.099
[groaning]

3
00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.013
[Lee] Teacher.

4
00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:37.264
Hm.

5
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:43.354
I see your talents have gone
beyond the mere physical level.

6
00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:47.608
Your skills are now at the point
of spiritual insight.

7
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.196
I have s-some questions: what is the highest
technique you hope to achieve?

8
00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:55.032
- To have no technique.
- Very good.

9
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.702
What are your thoughts
when facing an opponent?

10
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.579
There is no opponent.

11
00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:01.289
And why is that?

12
00:03:01.457 --> 00:03:05.585
Because the word "I" does not exist.

13
00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:09.213
So. Continue.

14
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.259
A good fight should be...

15
00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:18.973
like a small play, but played seriously.

16
00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:24.604
A good martial artist
does not become tense, but ready.

17
00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:28.232
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.

18
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.902
Ready for whatever may come.

19
00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:34.030
When the opponent expand, I contract.

20
00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:36.574
When he contracts, I expand.

21
00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:39.327
And when there is an opportunity...

22
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.622
I do not hit.

23
00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.501
It hits all by itself.

24
00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:49.253
Now, you must remember...

25
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.424
the enemy has only images
and illusions...

26
00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:57.094
behind which he hides his true motives.

27
00:03:57.262 --> 00:04:00.932
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

28
00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.604
The "it" that you refer to
is a powerful weapon...

29
00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:12.902
easily misused by the martial artist
who deserts his vows.

30
00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:18.407
For centuries now, the code
of the Shaolin Temple has been preserved.

31
00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:24.247
Remember, the honor of our brotherhood
has been held true.

32
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.418
Tell me now the Shaolin commandment
number 13.

33
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.589
"A martial artist has to take responsibility
for himself...

34
00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:37.510
and accept the consequences
of his own doing."

35
00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.140
I'm ashamed to tell you now...

36
00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:47.019
among all the Shaolin men
I have taught...

37
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:51.399
there is one who has turned
the ways of knowledge and strength...

38
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:54.402
to his own base ends.

39
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.490
He has perverted all we hold sacred.

40
00:05:00.158 --> 00:05:02.702
His name is Han.

41
00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:06.914
In defiance of all our beliefs...

42
00:05:09.293 --> 00:05:13.045
he has brought disgrace
to the Shaolin Temple.

43
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:19.010
So it is now for you to reclaim
our lost honor.

44
00:05:19.177 --> 00:05:22.305
Yes. I understand.

45
00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:26.475
There is a man here.
You will go to him.

46
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:36.903
[Braithwaite] Hello, Mr. Lee.
My name's Braithwaite.

47
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.196
Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.

48
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:43.743
I've come to speak to you
about a matter of great importance.

49
00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:46.871
- Have some tea?
- Yes, indeed.

50
00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:49.249
Ah.

51
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:52.335
This is very pleasant.

52
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.889
Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.

53
00:06:05.182 --> 00:06:08.017
A tournament to which
you've already received an invitation.

54
00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:12.271
Specifically, a tournament
organized by Mr. Han.

55
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:16.984
- Han's tournament.
- I know, I know, I know.

56
00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:21.656
But we'd very much like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.

57
00:06:22.157 --> 00:06:24.575
"We," Mr. Braithwaite?

58
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.746
It's Lao's time.

59
00:06:28.914 --> 00:06:30.915
Yes, of course.

60
00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:44.345
Kick me.

61
00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:47.807
Kick me.

62
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.901
What was that? An exhibition?

63
00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:03.614
We need emotional content.

64
00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:06.951
Try again.

65
00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:22.466
I said, emotional content, not anger.

66
00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.303
Now, try again. With me.

67
00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.399
That's it.

68
00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:40.985
How did it feel to you?

69
00:07:43.488 --> 00:07:45.823
[disciple] Let me think....

70
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:49.285
Don't think. Feel.

71
00:07:49.453 --> 00:07:53.873
It is like a finger pointing
a way to the moon.

72
00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:57.585
Don't concentrate on the finger...

73
00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:02.173
or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

74
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:05.217
Do you understand?

75
00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:14.435
Never take your eyes off your opponent,
even when you bow.

76
00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:17.688
That's it.

77
00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:42.166
There.

78
00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:45.836
That's Han. That's the only film
we have on him.

79
00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:48.088
We know that he was a member
of your temple.

80
00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:52.092
A Shaolin monk, now a renegade.

81
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.597
That's Oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.

82
00:10:56.765 --> 00:11:01.018
Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being Han's bodyguard.

83
00:11:02.145 --> 00:11:05.314
We got our hands
on a demonstration film of Oharra.

84
00:11:05.482 --> 00:11:09.693
All real bricks and boards,
nothing phony about any of it.

85
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:13.822
This was before he picked up
a facial scar somewhere.

86
00:11:24.376 --> 00:11:26.835
This is where you'll be going.

87
00:11:27.295 --> 00:11:30.005
An island fortress, really.

88
00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:35.928
After the war, the nationality
of the island was uncertain.

89
00:11:36.096 --> 00:11:39.807
And sometime after that, Han bought it.

90
00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:41.558
What do you know about Han?

91
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.103
He lives like a king on that island.

92
00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:47.106
Totally self-sufficient.

93
00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:49.066
All of his efforts, seemingly...

94
00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:55.322
are directed towards supporting
what he calls his "school of martial arts."

95
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.826
Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament...

96
00:11:58.994 --> 00:12:00.869
which he holds every three years.

97
00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:06.750
[Braithwaite] <i>This was a stewardess,
Mary King, found floating in the harbor.</i>

98
00:12:06.918 --> 00:12:09.586
<i>Nothing unusual about a body
in the harbor.</i>

99
00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:13.924
<i>But this girl was last seen at a party
aboard Han's private junk.</i>

100
00:12:14.092 --> 00:12:17.261
<i>They had reported her lost at sea
before the body was found.</i>

101
00:12:17.929 --> 00:12:20.055
<i>We believe he selects attractive girls...</i>

102
00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:22.933
<i>and methodically builds
their dependence on drugs...</i>

103
00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:26.562
<i>then sells them to an elite clientele
around the world.</i>

104
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.606
[Lee] <i>What did the autopsy reveal
as the cause of death?</i>

105
00:12:29.774 --> 00:12:32.943
-[Braithwaite] <i>She did not drown.</i>
-[Lee] <i>She OD'd?</i>

106
00:12:33.026 --> 00:12:34.194
Uh....

107
00:12:38.575 --> 00:12:43.454
Uh, yes. Cause of death
was, uh, heroin overdose.

108
00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:46.373
I gather you still don't have enough
to bust up his operation.

109
00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:50.836
We know everything.
We can prove nothing.

110
00:12:52.464 --> 00:12:54.923
We want you to go in there as our agent.

111
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:58.594
- Get us our evidence.
- And come out in one piece to give it to you.

112
00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:02.473
We'll give you anything you need.

113
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.267
Electronic equipment, weapons,
anything.

114
00:13:05.435 --> 00:13:08.062
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

115
00:13:08.229 --> 00:13:09.605
Guns.

116
00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:13.942
Now, why doesn't somebody
pull out a .45 and bang, settle it?

117
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.403
[Braithwaite] No. No guns.

118
00:13:17.113 --> 00:13:19.448
Look at this map here.

119
00:13:20.784 --> 00:13:25.871
As you know, the possession
of a weapon is a serious offense here.

120
00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:31.877
Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.

121
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:35.798
If we were given the slightest reason to
believe that he has any kind of arsenal...

122
00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:37.424
we'd move in on him.

123
00:13:37.592 --> 00:13:41.303
Besides, Han would never allow guns
on the island anyway.

124
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:46.016
He had a bad experience with them once
and he's fearful of assassination.

125
00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:50.604
Can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.

126
00:13:50.939 --> 00:13:53.107
I guess I won't need anything.

127
00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:56.568
There's a radio on the island.
We'll be monitoring it...

128
00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.654
on the chance you can get to it.

129
00:13:58.822 --> 00:14:00.239
And then you'll come?

130
00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:03.659
- Someone will.
- Oh.

131
00:14:03.827 --> 00:14:05.994
We aren't an agency of enforcement.

132
00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:10.332
We function as gatherers
of information, evidence.

133
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.752
Upon which interested
governments can act.

134
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.465
I see. If there's any trouble,
you make a phone call.

135
00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:20.843
[Braithwaite] Oh, by the way, two months ago...

136
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.431
we managed to place a female
operative on the island.

137
00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.766
Since then, we've, uh, lost her.

138
00:14:28.143 --> 00:14:30.352
If she's still there, she might have something.

139
00:14:30.728 --> 00:14:33.105
Name's, uh, Mei Ling.

140
00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:37.443
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.

141
00:15:16.065 --> 00:15:20.569
[Lee's father] But now the time has
come to tell you something very difficult.

142
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.824
I'm happy you have decided to go
to Han's tournament.

143
00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:27.993
Yeah.

144
00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:33.123
The last of the tournaments
were held three years ago.

145
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:38.462
I was in the city with your sister
at that time.

146
00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.883
I didn't know that.

147
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.260
Yes.

148
00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:49.056
[Lee's father] <i>Many of Han's men
had come in from the island.</i>

149
00:15:49.224 --> 00:15:53.602
<i>They were everywhere,
bullying and arrogant.</i>

150
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.939
<i>We were on our way into town.</i>

151
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.795
[grunting]

152
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:25.133
[Lee's father] Stay back!

153
00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.139
Run! Run!

154
00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:34.142
Now!

155
00:17:16.561 --> 00:17:18.188
[man screams]

156
00:19:56.179 --> 00:19:58.930
[Lee's father]
Now you know the truth.

157
00:19:59.515 --> 00:20:01.516
When you get to the city...

158
00:20:01.684 --> 00:20:06.688
pay your respects to your sister
and your mother.

159
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.528
I will, old man.

160
00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:35.467
You will not agree with
what I am going to do.

161
00:20:36.928 --> 00:20:40.555
It is contrary to all
that you have taught me...

162
00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:46.728
and all that Su Lin believed.

163
00:20:54.946 --> 00:20:57.239
I must leave.

164
00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:04.246
Please try to find a way to forgive me.

165
00:21:53.129 --> 00:21:56.549
[boat engine starts]

166
00:22:01.471 --> 00:22:03.473
[ship horn honks]

167
00:22:09.186 --> 00:22:11.021
[Roper] Double or nothing?

168
00:22:12.148 --> 00:22:14.316
[Golfer]
That's about a thousand bucks a foot, Roper.

169
00:22:16.485 --> 00:22:18.320
Why not?

170
00:22:31.292 --> 00:22:33.503
[phone rings]

171
00:22:34.795 --> 00:22:39.507
I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?

172
00:22:40.675 --> 00:22:41.927
Mm-hmm.

173
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:05.325
[man]
That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.

174
00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:11.706
Uh, excuse me, fellas.

175
00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:15.126
- I say he can't make it.
- What'll you bet?

176
00:23:16.379 --> 00:23:17.796
You gotta love him.

177
00:23:17.964 --> 00:23:23.093
Come on, Roper.
It's 175 big ones by Monday the 15th.

178
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.512
Only 150.

179
00:23:26.347 --> 00:23:28.139
You forget interest.

180
00:23:28.222 --> 00:23:30.516
Well, then,
maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.

181
00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:32.560
You take advantage, Roper.

182
00:23:33.229 --> 00:23:34.562
Come on, fellas.

183
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.565
It's the dough, Roper,
or we gotta break something.

184
00:23:39.276 --> 00:23:40.694
You got it?

185
00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:45.740
Freddie says this is for your own good.

186
00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:12.392
Better confirm that flight
to Hong Kong for me.

187
00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:18.940
- How much do I have left in the bank?
-[secretary] $63.43.

188
00:24:19.108 --> 00:24:22.360
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.

189
00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:25.989
-[secretary] Only, I think you'll need it.
- You wanna bet?

190
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.764
[dog barking]

191
00:25:35.059 --> 00:25:37.854
[laughing]

192
00:25:42.525 --> 00:25:46.487
[yelling]

193
00:25:58.207 --> 00:26:00.375
Double-punching. Ready....

194
00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:02.753
Ready?

195
00:26:18.728 --> 00:26:21.064
[dog barking]

196
00:26:27.362 --> 00:26:29.697
[tires screech]

197
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.368
[officer 1]
Going on a trip, are you?

198
00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:47.338
- Hey, this jig's got a passport.
- Where you going, jig?

199
00:26:48.924 --> 00:26:53.595
- Where's the plane ticket for?
- Hong Kong, via Hawaii.

200
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.014
He's not going to Hawaii.

201
00:26:57.016 --> 00:26:58.685
[grunting]

202
00:26:58.767 --> 00:27:01.519
[officer 2]
Well, look what we got here!

203
00:27:01.687 --> 00:27:04.397
Assaulting a police officer.

204
00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:16.786
[tires screech]

205
00:27:54.198 --> 00:27:57.951
- Hey, soldier, shape it up!
- Roper! Hey, how are you, man?

206
00:27:58.118 --> 00:28:02.163
How am I, man? How am I?
I'm glad to see you, that's how I am.

207
00:28:02.331 --> 00:28:06.000
- Hey, how long has it been? Five...?
- Six years, man.

208
00:28:06.168 --> 00:28:08.002
- Six. Wow.
- Not as long as it seems.

209
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.629
Yeah, I know what you mean.

210
00:28:09.797 --> 00:28:13.591
- What you been doing since Nam?
- Hanging in a little bit.

211
00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:15.843
- All these yours, man?
- Always first-class.

212
00:28:16.011 --> 00:28:19.639
Same old Roper. Huh.

213
00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:24.477
Come here.

214
00:28:27.856 --> 00:28:30.900
-[Williams] Parsons.
-[Roper] Yeah, from New Zealand.

215
00:28:31.068 --> 00:28:33.945
This man's putting
quite a collection together.

216
00:28:34.363 --> 00:28:38.074
-[Williams] Know him?
-[Roper] Uh-uh. Never saw him before.

217
00:28:39.576 --> 00:28:41.703
What do you know about this Han cat?

218
00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:45.498
Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.

219
00:28:50.129 --> 00:28:52.171
They don't live so big over there.

220
00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:54.882
Ghettos are the same all over the world.

221
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.343
They stink.

222
00:28:58.846 --> 00:29:00.638
Same old Williams.

223
00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:04.017
Yeah.

224
00:30:15.923 --> 00:30:19.886
[chattering in Chinese]

225
00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:30.853
[Roper]
What have we got here? A little action.

226
00:30:31.021 --> 00:30:35.525
Insects. Okay, I'll lay you 50 bucks
on the big one.

227
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.778
Fifty. $50 on the big one, all right?

228
00:30:38.946 --> 00:30:40.530
I'll give you 5-to-1.

229
00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:42.865
Would you bet a hundred?

230
00:30:44.743 --> 00:30:45.993
You're on.

231
00:30:54.503 --> 00:30:58.214
[Roper] Come on,
let's end this thing quickly. Whoa!

232
00:30:58.298 --> 00:31:00.758
Atta baby. Come on. Come on!

233
00:31:01.635 --> 00:31:05.638
Hey, that's it. Come on. Just get him
on his back. On his back! Come on!

234
00:31:05.806 --> 00:31:09.267
Come on. Give up!
Come on! Hey.

235
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:14.397
Oh, for crying out loud.
Would you believe that?

236
00:31:17.818 --> 00:31:20.069
Dumb shit.

237
00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:13.956
[Parsons] Do I bother you?

238
00:32:14.541 --> 00:32:16.542
Don't waste yourself.

239
00:32:17.961 --> 00:32:21.547
- What's your style?
- My style?

240
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:25.384
You can call it the art of fighting
without fighting.

241
00:32:25.719 --> 00:32:28.221
"The art of fighting without fighting"?

242
00:32:29.056 --> 00:32:31.182
-[Parsons] Show me some of it.
- Later.

243
00:32:38.482 --> 00:32:40.233
All right.

244
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.903
Don't you think we need more room?

245
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.532
Where else?

246
00:32:48.742 --> 00:32:53.704
That island, on the beach.
We can take this boat.

247
00:33:01.255 --> 00:33:03.005
Okay.

248
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:19.939
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, are you crazy?

249
00:33:20.524 --> 00:33:22.125
[laughing]

250
00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.860
[Parsons]
Pull me in! Pull me in!

251
00:33:26.613 --> 00:33:31.200
Don't try to pull yourself up
or I'll let go of the line.

252
00:33:32.328 --> 00:33:34.804
[Parsons yelling}

253
00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:37.164
Come on, kid! Come on, pull!

254
00:34:31.594 --> 00:34:33.804
Mm. Would you look at that?

255
00:34:37.768 --> 00:34:41.979
A woman like that could teach you
a lot about yourself.

256
00:35:05.462 --> 00:35:07.171
Welcome.

257
00:35:22.271 --> 00:35:25.858
[yelling]

258
00:36:04.646 --> 00:36:06.397
This way.

259
00:36:09.401 --> 00:36:13.279
I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8.

260
00:36:13.447 --> 00:36:16.657
I think you'll find our little island
quite charming.

261
00:36:22.832 --> 00:36:24.583
[chattering]

262
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.419
[music plays]

263
00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:17.862
Say, I hope you haven't spent all
that money you won from me yesterday.

264
00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:20.573
- I plan to win it back.
- Oh? How?

265
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.702
You'll find out, after you've lost it.

266
00:38:25.328 --> 00:38:28.497
You seem to be very much
at home here, Mr. Roper.

267
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.084
This guy Han's got a great sense
of hospitality.

268
00:38:32.252 --> 00:38:35.004
And a fantastic sense of style.

269
00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.716
Yeah, it's great.

270
00:38:38.884 --> 00:38:40.759
Then why are you so apprehensive?

271
00:38:41.011 --> 00:38:42.720
Apprehensive?

272
00:38:43.763 --> 00:38:47.725
No. I was just wondering
whether it was okay to drink the water.

273
00:38:48.184 --> 00:38:51.645
Mr. Roper, don't con me.

274
00:38:51.813 --> 00:38:53.105
Wanna bet?

275
00:39:01.197 --> 00:39:02.365
[Williams] Hmm...

276
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:07.912
No. I really don't think so. Thanks.

277
00:39:08.288 --> 00:39:10.289
What's the matter, you on a diet?

278
00:39:10.457 --> 00:39:13.959
I'd like to eat, if I could
find something I could keep down.

279
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:19.632
Well, I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his B parties.

280
00:39:20.133 --> 00:39:23.135
You ever been to
a martial arts tournament like this?

281
00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:26.013
Never.

282
00:39:26.181 --> 00:39:29.475
I have a funny feeling we're being
fattened up for the kill.

283
00:39:31.645 --> 00:39:33.896
Better keep an eye out for the referee.

284
00:39:34.064 --> 00:39:36.482
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

285
00:39:55.127 --> 00:39:57.546
[gong crashes]

286
00:40:12.268 --> 00:40:15.479
Gentlemen, welcome.

287
00:40:15.647 --> 00:40:18.190
You honor our island.

288
00:40:18.858 --> 00:40:22.027
I look forward to a tournament...

289
00:40:22.195 --> 00:40:25.531
of truly epic proportions.

290
00:40:26.032 --> 00:40:28.492
We are unique, gentlemen...

291
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.787
in that we create ourselves...

292
00:40:31.955 --> 00:40:34.832
through long years
of rigorous training...

293
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.960
sacrifice, denial, pain.

294
00:40:38.128 --> 00:40:43.215
We forge our bodies
in the fire of our will.

295
00:40:43.383 --> 00:40:46.677
But tonight, let us celebrate.

296
00:40:46.845 --> 00:40:52.683
Gentlemen, you have our gratitude.

297
00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:07.698
Oh!

298
00:41:43.152 --> 00:41:46.113
[chattering]

299
00:41:46.822 --> 00:41:49.158
[music plays]

300
00:41:54.163 --> 00:41:56.498
[music plays
through headphones]

301
00:41:56.957 --> 00:41:59.168
[knocking]

302
00:41:59.918 --> 00:42:01.794
[Tania] Mr. Williams.

303
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:13.263
Mr. Williams!

304
00:42:22.065 --> 00:42:23.899
For me?

305
00:42:27.153 --> 00:42:28.987
You shouldn't have.

306
00:42:29.697 --> 00:42:31.448
But....

307
00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:35.369
I'll take you, darling.

308
00:42:38.205 --> 00:42:39.706
And you.

309
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.045
And you.

310
00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:48.632
And you.

311
00:42:52.345 --> 00:42:55.681
Please understand, if I missed anyone...

312
00:42:56.057 --> 00:42:58.267
it's been a big day.

313
00:42:58.434 --> 00:43:00.018
I'm a little tired.

314
00:43:01.271 --> 00:43:04.231
Oh, of course, Mr. Williams.

315
00:43:04.691 --> 00:43:08.068
You must conserve your strength.

316
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:10.906
[knocking]

317
00:43:10.697 --> 00:43:12.281
Come in.

318
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.621
[Tania]
A gift, Mr. Lee.

319
00:43:27.881 --> 00:43:32.050
- If you don't see anything you like....
- There was a girl at the feast tonight.

320
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:33.552
Which girl, sir?

321
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.722
The owner of this dart.

322
00:43:38.558 --> 00:43:41.727
Oh, yes. I know the one.

323
00:43:42.437 --> 00:43:43.896
I'll send her to you.

324
00:43:51.696 --> 00:43:54.406
Another fine mess you got me into.

325
00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:57.577
[knocking]

326
00:43:57.994 --> 00:43:59.620
Come in.

327
00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:15.135
Hi.

328
00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.514
[Roper]
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.

329
00:44:19.682 --> 00:44:21.558
What did you have in mind?

330
00:44:21.851 --> 00:44:23.602
Pick one.

331
00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:28.398
I already have.

332
00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:32.736
Wise decision.

333
00:44:35.782 --> 00:44:37.784
[knocking]

334
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:48.752
I wanna talk to you, Mei Ling.

335
00:44:50.463 --> 00:44:52.047
Where do you come from?

336
00:44:52.215 --> 00:44:54.716
- Braithwaite--
- Shh, shh. Let's be quiet.

337
00:44:54.968 --> 00:44:56.260
Have you seen anything?

338
00:44:56.552 --> 00:45:00.931
Nothing much.
I'm kept in the palace, watched always.

339
00:45:01.266 --> 00:45:04.476
I know nothing of Han's activities
away from the palace.

340
00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:07.729
But I can tell you this: people disappear.

341
00:45:07.897 --> 00:45:11.149
- Who?
- The girls. Every one of them.

342
00:45:11.317 --> 00:45:15.570
They're summoned to Han's at night
and the next day they're gone.

343
00:45:17.156 --> 00:45:19.241
I know I don't have much time.

344
00:45:28.794 --> 00:45:31.046
[yells]

345
00:45:33.756 --> 00:45:37.426
You must attend the morning ritual
in uniform.

346
00:45:37.593 --> 00:45:39.511
Outside.

347
00:45:47.771 --> 00:45:50.649
[yelling]

348
00:45:59.949 --> 00:46:03.201
Mr. Lee, why you no wear uniform?

349
00:47:02.428 --> 00:47:05.097
[Han]
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin!

350
00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:12.372
- Bolo.

351
00:47:12.397 --> 00:47:13.440
[yells]

352
00:47:13.465 --> 00:47:13.980
- Go!

353
00:47:31.291 --> 00:47:34.252
[yelling]

354
00:47:51.436 --> 00:47:54.189
[speaking indistinctly]

355
00:48:43.946 --> 00:48:46.823
Good work. You made me some bread.

356
00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.242
-[man] Mr. Roper.
- I'm ready.

357
00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.036
[man] Okay.

358
00:48:53.247 --> 00:48:56.374
I got myself a real pigeon here.

359
00:48:56.542 --> 00:48:59.127
Keep the action going for me, will you?

360
00:48:59.545 --> 00:49:01.171
What do you think, Roper?

361
00:49:01.339 --> 00:49:06.718
Oh, no sweat.
Give my friend 8-to-3 all the way.

362
00:50:31.096 --> 00:50:33.682
[grunting and groaning]

363
00:50:48.571 --> 00:50:52.033
[moaning and giggling]

364
00:50:56.954 --> 00:50:59.414
I'm finding out about myself.

365
00:50:59.832 --> 00:51:02.667
This is the real me, definitely.

366
00:51:03.336 --> 00:51:04.836
[Tania] Do you like it here?

367
00:51:05.004 --> 00:51:07.172
[Roper]
Oh, yeah. But a little lower.

368
00:51:07.757 --> 00:51:11.009
No. I mean here on the island.

369
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.846
Yeah, I like it here.
But a little lower.

370
00:51:15.014 --> 00:51:17.515
A man like you belongs here.

371
00:51:24.565 --> 00:51:27.317
[Roper]
Oh, to you, I'm just another pretty face.

372
00:51:58.724 --> 00:52:00.892
Where you go?

373
00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.519
Out in the moonlight, baby.

374
00:52:02.895 --> 00:52:07.315
- It is not allowed. You must stay.
- Oh?

375
00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:09.859
Goodbye.

376
00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.579
[dog barking]

377
00:55:38.903 --> 00:55:41.280
[knocks]

378
00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.661
Huh.

379
00:57:51.744 --> 00:57:53.411
A human fly.

380
00:57:57.041 --> 00:57:58.666
[Han] Gentlemen...

381
00:57:59.168 --> 00:58:01.669
it seems that one of you...

382
00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:05.214
was not content last night...

383
00:58:05.758 --> 00:58:09.927
with the hospitality of the palace...

384
00:58:11.096 --> 00:58:16.768
and sought diversion
elsewhere on the island.

385
00:58:17.436 --> 00:58:21.564
Who it was is not important...

386
00:58:21.732 --> 00:58:23.816
at this time.

387
00:58:24.276 --> 00:58:27.445
What is important is that...

388
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:33.993
my guards performed
their duties incompetently.

389
00:58:34.161 --> 00:58:36.954
And now they must prove...

390
00:58:37.122 --> 00:58:42.126
themselves worthy
to remain among us.

391
00:58:43.171 --> 00:58:45.965
[yelling]

392
00:59:07.612 --> 00:59:09.989
[grunting]

393
00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:15.077
[groaning]

394
00:59:35.473 --> 00:59:36.724
[cracks]

395
01:00:25.564 --> 01:00:28.441
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?

396
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:31.861
Only at how sloppy your man works.

397
01:00:36.241 --> 01:00:37.408
Mr. Lee?

398
01:00:39.578 --> 01:00:41.537
Are you ready?

399
01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:23.204
Boards don't hit back.

400
01:01:27.209 --> 01:01:29.835
- Bolo.
- Go!

401
01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:19.261
Oharra!

402
01:03:23.284 --> 01:03:25.453
[grunts]

403
01:03:33.669 --> 01:03:35.171
[Han] Oharra!

404
01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:59.361
[cracking]

405
01:04:36.231 --> 01:04:39.817
Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.

406
01:04:59.171 --> 01:05:02.047
If you wanna talk about this thing,
I'll be in my room.

407
01:05:02.215 --> 01:05:04.008
Gotcha.

408
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:10.097
Williams? Williams.

409
01:05:10.265 --> 01:05:13.226
Come here. I want you to go
to Han's study as soon as possible.

410
01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.478
All right.

411
01:05:18.106 --> 01:05:20.816
[Williams] Hey, Roper.
I'll see you in half an hour.

412
01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.610
[Roper] Right.

413
01:05:28.284 --> 01:05:29.868
[door opens and closes]

414
01:05:31.036 --> 01:05:33.954
- Mr. Han?
- You fought well yesterday.

415
01:05:35.123 --> 01:05:37.374
Your style is unorthodox.

416
01:05:37.792 --> 01:05:38.918
But effective.

417
01:05:39.544 --> 01:05:43.380
It is not the art,
but the combat that you enjoy.

418
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.342
The winning.

419
01:05:47.093 --> 01:05:49.637
We are all ready to win...

420
01:05:49.804 --> 01:05:53.641
just as we are born
knowing only life.

421
01:05:55.352 --> 01:06:00.314
It is defeat that you must learn
to prepare for.

422
01:06:02.275 --> 01:06:04.193
I don't waste my time with it.

423
01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:07.321
When it comes, I won't even notice.

424
01:06:07.614 --> 01:06:09.114
Oh? How so?

425
01:06:09.783 --> 01:06:12.326
I'll be too busy looking good.

426
01:06:13.453 --> 01:06:16.455
What were you looking for
when you attacked my guards?

427
01:06:17.123 --> 01:06:18.541
Wasn't me.

428
01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:22.336
You were the only man
outside the palace.

429
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:26.966
I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.

430
01:06:27.467 --> 01:06:29.468
You will tell me who else.

431
01:06:30.136 --> 01:06:34.181
Mr. Han, suddenly
I'd like to leave your island.

432
01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:38.477
- It is not possible.
- Bullshit, Mr. Han-Man!

433
01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:48.654
Man, you come right out of
a comic book.

434
01:07:11.678 --> 01:07:14.013
Been practicing, huh?

435
01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:45.713
[women laughing and giggling]

436
01:09:00.328 --> 01:09:02.955
[Roper] But my friend Williams
is expecting me in my room.

437
01:09:03.039 --> 01:09:04.708
[Han] I wanted to talk to you.

438
01:09:04.791 --> 01:09:07.668
We will meet your friend Williams later.

439
01:09:07.836 --> 01:09:11.380
- Okay.
- This is my museum.

440
01:09:12.132 --> 01:09:14.967
It is difficult
to associate these horrors...

441
01:09:15.135 --> 01:09:18.011
with the proud civilizations
that created them:

442
01:09:18.179 --> 01:09:23.350
Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe,
the samurai.

443
01:09:23.518 --> 01:09:27.312
They worshipped strength,
because it is strength...

444
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.566
that makes all other values possible.

445
01:09:30.775 --> 01:09:33.777
Nothing survives without it.

446
01:09:33.987 --> 01:09:38.323
Who knows what delicate wonders
have died out of the world...

447
01:09:38.491 --> 01:09:41.368
for want of the strength to survive?

448
01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:43.370
[Roper] What's this?

449
01:09:45.664 --> 01:09:46.748
Oh.

450
01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:49.918
A souvenir.

451
01:10:00.889 --> 01:10:03.182
- Up here.
-[Roper] A guillotine? Uh, no, thanks.

452
01:10:03.349 --> 01:10:05.934
This is the only angle I care
to see it from.

453
01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:08.562
If you please, Mr. Roper.

454
01:10:11.191 --> 01:10:13.358
You mean you want me to put my head
on that thing?

455
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.195
An act of faith.

456
01:10:18.323 --> 01:10:20.908
Mm, I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.

457
01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:30.752
[cat meows]

458
01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:40.469
Very few people can be totally ruthless.
It isn't easy.

459
01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:43.388
It takes more strength
than you might believe.

460
01:11:04.577 --> 01:11:06.787
Now you've got eight more.

461
01:11:14.629 --> 01:11:18.465
Then there is a point
you will not go beyond.

462
01:11:22.554 --> 01:11:24.429
Faked out again.

463
01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:35.440
This way.

464
01:11:46.077 --> 01:11:48.120
Our power plant.

465
01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:02.718
[Roper] Oh, yeah.

466
01:12:03.303 --> 01:12:06.346
A lifetime of women, huh?

467
01:12:06.514 --> 01:12:09.141
A man's strength
can be measured by his appetites.

468
01:12:09.309 --> 01:12:13.145
Indeed, a man's strength flows
from his appetites.

469
01:12:13.313 --> 01:12:16.648
Oh, no. They are my daughters.

470
01:12:18.526 --> 01:12:20.527
Your daughters?

471
01:12:22.155 --> 01:12:24.741
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that--
I misunderstood.

472
01:12:24.824 --> 01:12:25.992
Miss, uh, Han?

473
01:12:31.664 --> 01:12:35.000
And also,
they are my most personal guard.

474
01:12:35.501 --> 01:12:37.628
I admire your judgment.

475
01:12:37.795 --> 01:12:41.506
Nobody's as loyal as daddy's little girl.

476
01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:44.593
-[woman] Mr. Roper?
- Uh, no, thanks.

477
01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:47.679
I'll, uh, get up myself.

478
01:12:48.348 --> 01:12:49.848
Nice meeting you.

479
01:12:58.232 --> 01:13:00.233
Opium.

480
01:13:01.568 --> 01:13:02.861
Uh-oh.

481
01:13:03.029 --> 01:13:07.199
We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.

482
01:13:07.367 --> 01:13:10.869
The business of corruption
is like any other.

483
01:13:11.037 --> 01:13:12.371
Oh, yeah.

484
01:13:12.538 --> 01:13:17.417
Provide your, uh, customers
with products they need...

485
01:13:17.585 --> 01:13:21.546
and, uh, encourage that need a little bit
to stimulate your market...

486
01:13:21.714 --> 01:13:25.050
and pretty soon your customers
will come to depend on you.

487
01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:27.552
I mean, really need you.
It's the law of economics.

488
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.388
Right.

489
01:13:29.555 --> 01:13:33.475
And here we are stimulating
quite another need.

490
01:13:50.576 --> 01:13:54.579
You wonder why I am exposing
so much of myself?

491
01:13:54.747 --> 01:13:58.000
I forget what I see very easily.

492
01:13:58.251 --> 01:13:59.459
But then, why are you?

493
01:14:00.086 --> 01:14:05.007
I'm hoping you'll join us,
represent us in the United States.

494
01:14:06.426 --> 01:14:10.429
I'm beginning to understand this thing
with the tournament. The whole setup.

495
01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:13.432
It's a great way
to recruit new talent, huh?

496
01:14:19.439 --> 01:14:21.273
And who are they?

497
01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:25.944
Refuse found in waterfront bars.

498
01:14:26.738 --> 01:14:28.739
Shanghaied?

499
01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.201
[Han] Just lost, drunken men...

500
01:14:31.284 --> 01:14:34.621
who no longer care where
they find themselves each morning.

501
01:14:42.795 --> 01:14:46.965
You left some rather
sizable debts in America.

502
01:14:47.133 --> 01:14:50.635
Diners Club hasn't called in my card yet.

503
01:14:56.050 --> 01:15:01.650
Oh, sh--

504
01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:06.485
There were some questions
which I was forced to ask.

505
01:15:06.778 --> 01:15:08.904
I got no answers.

506
01:15:29.175 --> 01:15:31.510
And you want me to join this?

507
01:15:31.677 --> 01:15:33.845
There are certain realities.

508
01:15:34.013 --> 01:15:38.350
I want us to have a clear understanding.

509
01:15:50.571 --> 01:15:52.239
No.

510
01:15:53.533 --> 01:15:56.034
There's no misunderstanding between us.

511
01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:28.735
[hissing]

512
01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:07.417
[knocking]

513
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.503
Help me. Help, I'm 17!

514
01:18:11.837 --> 01:18:15.590
I-I'm from California.
Help me! Please, help me!

515
01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:19.719
Mister, come back, please!
You have to come back. Please!

516
01:18:19.887 --> 01:18:21.931
Help me! Help me!

517
01:18:22.015 --> 01:18:23.474
-[nurse] Come on!
- Please! Help!

518
01:18:23.558 --> 01:18:24.725
Hey, Quiet! Shut up!

519
01:18:51.378 --> 01:18:54.464
[radio beeping]

520
01:19:19.739 --> 01:19:21.991
[hisses]

521
01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:30.917
[yelling indistinctly]

522
01:19:53.106 --> 01:19:56.443
[alarm sounds]

523
01:20:22.093 --> 01:20:24.971
[men yelling]

524
01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:09.474
[cracks]

525
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:39.879
[cracks]

526
01:21:52.225 --> 01:21:54.978
[men yelling]

527
01:24:19.538 --> 01:24:22.540
[Han] The battle with the guards
was magnificent.

528
01:24:23.208 --> 01:24:26.210
Your skill is extraordinary.

529
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.882
And I was going to ask you to join us.

530
01:24:46.899 --> 01:24:51.235
My God! This came in half an hour ago!
Why didn't I--?

531
01:24:51.779 --> 01:24:54.781
Hello. Put your colonel on.

532
01:24:55.574 --> 01:24:57.575
Well, wake him up.

533
01:24:58.744 --> 01:25:02.163
I don't care if he's not alone.

534
01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:08.503
Damn it all, I don't care who he's with!
You bloody well put him on the line!

535
01:25:34.321 --> 01:25:38.950
Good morning, Mr. Roper.
We have been waiting for you.

536
01:25:39.952 --> 01:25:41.285
What's going on?

537
01:25:41.453 --> 01:25:45.707
Would you be good enough to participate
in this morning's edification?

538
01:25:45.999 --> 01:25:47.291
Edification.

539
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.049
What are you gonna do to him?

540
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.636
Not me, Mr. Roper. You.

541
01:26:01.473 --> 01:26:03.224
Bolo?

542
01:26:41.346 --> 01:26:43.347
Like you said...

543
01:26:43.724 --> 01:26:46.184
there's a point I won't go beyond.

544
01:26:46.518 --> 01:26:48.686
I was right about you.

545
01:26:48.854 --> 01:26:53.191
We shall strive to be worthy
of your sense of grandeur.

546
01:26:53.525 --> 01:26:56.778
I will find someone with whom
you can fight.

547
01:26:56.987 --> 01:26:58.488
Bolo.

549
01:28:52.144 --> 01:28:55.648
[yelling in Chinese]

550
01:29:19.046 --> 01:29:20.630
[in English]
Quick, go destroy them! Kill!

551
01:29:34.687 --> 01:29:38.190
[yelling in Chinese]

552
01:29:50.744 --> 01:29:52.578
[Han] Kill them!

553
01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:56.125
[yelling in Chinese]

554
01:29:58.043 --> 01:30:00.711
[Han] Kill them all! Kill!

555
01:32:48.213 --> 01:32:54.051
You have offended my family
and you have offended a Shaolin Temple.

556
01:33:38.555 --> 01:33:41.392
[yelling]

557
01:38:22.881 --> 01:38:24.798

<i>Remember...</i>

558
01:38:24.966 --> 01:38:28.093
<i>the enemy has only images
and illusions...</i>

559
01:38:28.261 --> 01:38:32.556
<i>behind which
he hides his true motives.</i>

560
01:38:32.974 --> 01:38:38.061
<i>Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.</i>

561
01:39:49.301 --> 01:39:51.470
[Han screams]

562
01:40:27.047 --> 01:40:30.258
