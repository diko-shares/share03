LEE: Teacher.
- Hm.

4
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.205
I see your talents have gone
beyond the mere physical level.

5
00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:47.459
Your skills are now at the point
of spiritual insight.

6
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.047
I have questions: what is the highest
technique you hope to achieve?

7
00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.883
- To have no technique.
- Very good.

8
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.552
What are your thoughts
when facing an opponent?

9
00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.429
There is no opponent.

10
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.139
And why is that?

11
00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:05.435
Because the word "I" does not exist.

12
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.064
So. Continue.

13
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.110
A good fight should be...

14
00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:18.824
...like a small play, but played seriously.

15
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:24.454
A good martial artist
does not become tense, but ready.

16
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:28.083
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.

17
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.752
Ready for whatever may come.

18
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.880
When the opponent expand, I contract.

19
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.425
When he contracts, I expand.

20
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.177
And when there is an opportunity...

21
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.472
...I do not hit.

22
00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.351
It hits all by itself.

23
00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:49.104
Now, you must remember...

24
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.275
...the enemy has only images
and illusions...

25
00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:56.945
...behind which he hides his true motives.

26
00:03:57.112 --> 00:04:00.782
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

27
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.455
The "it" that you refer to
is a powerful weapon...

28
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:12.753
...easily misused by the martial artist
who deserts his vows.

29
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:18.258
For centuries now, the code
of the Shaolin Temple has been preserved.

30
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:24.097
Remember, the honor of our brotherhood
has been held true.

31
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.269
Tell me now the Shaolin commandment
number 13.

32
00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:33.440
"A martial artist has to take responsibility
for himself...

33
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:37.360
...and accept the consequences
of his own doing."

34
00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.991
I'm ashamed to tell you now...

35
00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.870
...among all the Shaolin men
I have taught...

36
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.249
...there is one who has turned
the ways of knowledge and strength...

37
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.252
...to his own base ends.

38
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.341
He has perverted all we hold sacred.

39
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.552
His name is Han.

40
00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.765
In defiance of all our beliefs...

41
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:12.896
...he has brought disgrace
to the Shaolin Temple.

42
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.860
So it is now for you to reclaim
our lost honor.

43
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:22.155
Yes. I understand.

44
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:26.326

You will go to him.

- Have some tea?
- Yes, indeed.

49

This is very pleasant.

50
00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:05.073
Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.

51

A tournament to which
you've received an invitation.

52
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.539
Specifically, a tournament
organized by Mr. Han.

53
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.168
- Han's tournament.
- I know, I know, I know.

54
00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:21.840
But we'd very much like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.

What was that? An exhibition?

a way to the moon.

Don't concentrate on the finger...

we have on him.

We know he was a member
of your temple.

Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being Han's bodyguard.

81

We got our hands
on a demonstration film of Oharra.

All real bricks and boards,
nothing phony about any of it.

83
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:14.007

a facial scar somewhere.

An island fortress, really.

86

After the war, the nationality
of the island was uncertain.

87
00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.949
And sometime after that, Han bought it.

88
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.701
What do you know about Han?

89
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.245
He lives like a king on that island.

Totally self-sufficient.

All of his efforts, seemingly...

92
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:55.465
...are directed toward supporting
what he calls his "school of martial arts."

93
00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.968
Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament...

94
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.054
...which he holds every three years.

was heroin overdose.

pull out a .45 and bang, settle it?

Look at this map here.

of a weapon is a serious offense here.

Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.

119

If we had the slightest reason to
believe he has any kind of arsenal...

120

...we'd move in on him.

121

Besides, Han would never allow guns
on the island anyway.

122
00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:46.159

and he's fearful of assassination.
