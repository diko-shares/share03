00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.994
Trick or treat!

3
00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:13.173
Happy Halloween!

4
00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:31.159
Man, I see what
you're doing over there.

5
00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:35.429
You're up, right?

6
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.932
Come on, hostess.
It's your play.

7
00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:42.503
I feel like
it's your turn.

8
00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:44.238
- Horny devil.
- Yeah.

9
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.510
I think Cheryl should go.

10
00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:51.047
Who will I meet tonight?

11
00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:54.414
Oh ho!

12
00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:57.220
All right, Cheryl!

13
00:02:07.897 --> 00:02:09.532
Stop.

14
00:02:13.303 --> 00:02:15.371
I'm telling your mom!

15
00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:18.105
Yo, yo.
Group up, group up.

16
00:02:18.107 --> 00:02:20.408
Everyone say,
"Troy's number one."

17
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.610
Troy's an asshole!

18
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.414
Yeah, yeah.
Laugh it up, fuckfaces.

19
00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:27.949
Who's next?
Come on.

20
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:29.850
It's your turn, Trick.

21
00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:33.521
Trick. Trickster.
Let's go, man.

22
00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:35.559
- Let's see it, pumpkinhead.
- Come on, Trick.

23
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:50.872
Oh, no!

24
00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:54.875
Let's go.

25
00:02:54.877 --> 00:02:56.846
It's your lucky night.

26
00:02:58.214 --> 00:03:00.581
- No! No re-spins.
- It's just a kiss.

27
00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:02.116
Just get it over with.

28
00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:03.917
Don't be chickenshit, man.

29
00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.857
Do it with a guy, Trick!
Yeah!

30
00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:10.057
Come on, hey.
What's he doing now?

31
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.524
If it feels good do it,
Trick.

32
00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:14.896
Hey! Lose the mask
if you're gonna kiss him.

33
00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:16.596
What is he doing?

34
00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:18.332
I'll get
out of the way here.

35
00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:20.034
Let's give him a little
motivation here, huh?

36
00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:21.469
Slow clap for Trick?

37
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:24.471
Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick!

38
00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:26.273
Trick! Trick! Trick!

39
00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:28.475
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick!

40
00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:30.143
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!

41
00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:31.678
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!

42
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.647
Trick! Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!

43
00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.519
Trick! Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!

44
00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.266
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

45
00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:56.939
Let go of me!

46
00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.588
Stop!
Please!

47
00:04:13.088 --> 00:04:15.157
Stop!
Stop!

48
00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:21.194
Get him, Troy!

49
00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:22.963
You fucking psycho!

50
00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:24.264
Shit!

51
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.417
No!

52
00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:50.960
Get off!

53
00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:54.998
Help!

54
00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:17.117
Trick!

55
00:05:48.518 --> 00:05:52.522
You batshit-fucking-crazy
son of a bitch.

56
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.121
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

57
00:06:27.123 --> 00:06:28.823
Thanks for coming.
I know it's a long drive.

58
00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:32.729
But they're gonna question
my every move on this one.

59
00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:36.163
Did you tell them
that you're the only cadet

60
00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:38.098
I ever learned
a few things from?

61
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.234
Like that'll matter.

62
00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:41.836
Either way,
I'm happy to help.

63
00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:44.641
You say that now.

64
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:03.557
Why does he have
that shit all over his face?

65
00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:04.591
It was a Halloween party.

66
00:07:04.593 --> 00:07:06.259
Okay, why does he <i>still</i>

67
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:07.530
have that shit
all over his face?

68
00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:10.364
They were more concerned
with saving his life

69
00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:11.334
than washing his face.

70
00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:13.833
So this Patrick Weaver,

71
00:07:13.835 --> 00:07:16.170
he killed four seniors
at a Halloween party?

72
00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:20.374
Five.
Fifth just died in surgery.

73
00:07:20.376 --> 00:07:23.744
Four more injured,
two critical.

74
00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:26.614
One, Troy Meeks...
junior, football captain...

75
00:07:26.616 --> 00:07:29.583
stabbed Patrick
with a fireplace poker.

76
00:07:29.585 --> 00:07:32.153
Were it not for Troy,
there would be more dead.

77
00:07:32.155 --> 00:07:33.821
He's 18 with no priors?

78
00:07:33.823 --> 00:07:35.258
Trick killed Evan.

79
00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:41.295
And Dan and Tammy and Parker.

80
00:07:41.297 --> 00:07:43.864
- Trick?
- Patrick.

81
00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:46.570
E-Everyone calls him Trick.

82
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.304
Did he have a beef
with the other kids?

83
00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:52.906
He didn't have beef
with anyone. He...

84
00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:56.177
He was quiet.
Smart.

85
00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:58.278
So he was bullied.

86
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.413
Um...

87
00:08:00.415 --> 00:08:01.717
No, he...

88
00:08:08.456 --> 00:08:10.857
No, no.
Not that I know of.

89
00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:13.460
He...

90
00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:16.866
He used to help people
with their homework.

91
00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:23.336
You should go.
I'll be in touch tomorrow.

92
00:08:23.338 --> 00:08:25.338
Can I see Nicky?

93
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.244
Yeah.
She's upstairs.

94
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.313
We're trying to
find his parents.

95
00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:33.613
As soon as we do,
you can talk to them.

96
00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:35.683
Well, he's 18,
so parental permission,

97
00:08:35.685 --> 00:08:36.950
it's a courtesy.

98
00:08:36.952 --> 00:08:38.785
This kid
in the big leagues now.

99
00:08:38.787 --> 00:08:41.191
And I'm betting that he's got
a date with death row.

100
00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:48.561
Hey, how you doing?

101
00:08:48.563 --> 00:08:50.631
Deputy Green,
this is Detective Denver.

102
00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:52.433
We go back a ways.

103
00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:54.501
Could you grab us
a couple coffees, please?

104
00:08:54.503 --> 00:08:55.872
And take this.

105
00:08:57.974 --> 00:08:59.305
How is he?

106
00:08:59.307 --> 00:09:01.275
Hell of a scar
in his future,

107
00:09:01.277 --> 00:09:02.609
but with a little bit of luck,

108
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:04.277
he'll be back on his feet
in no time.

109
00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.447
Give us a minute, Doc?

110
00:09:08.618 --> 00:09:11.618
I know they said this kid
did some terrible things,

111
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.686
but do I need to remind him
his rights?

112
00:09:13.688 --> 00:09:15.224
No.

113
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.529
Patrick, you already know
Sheriff Lisa Jayne.

114
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:25.632
And, look, I heard
you're a good kid.

115
00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:27.468
What made you
lose it tonight?

116
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.770
Were you provoked?

117
00:09:29.772 --> 00:09:32.405
Did you feel threatened?

118
00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:33.509
Were those kids
bullying you?

119
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.449
Hey, can we get somebody to come
wipe this crap off his face?

120
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:44.318
I'd like to see
who I'm talking to.

121
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.589
Of course.

122
00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:48.888
Kid, you got to work with me.

123
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.591
If you want my help,

124
00:09:50.593 --> 00:09:52.796
you got to tell me
your side of the story.

125
00:09:57.999 --> 00:09:59.565
This isn't gonna do.

126
00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:01.401
And the strong, silent types,

127
00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:02.705
they don't last long
in prison.

128
00:10:04.473 --> 00:10:06.876
And I got to tell you, you're
looking at more than life...

129
00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:32.900
Help him out, Doc.

130
00:10:32.902 --> 00:10:35.437
Which way did he go?
You see him?

131
00:10:36.906 --> 00:10:39.309
- Oh, God.
- Let's get him.

132
00:10:45.513 --> 00:10:47.650
Hey.
Come here, kid!

133
00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:06.669
Hey!

134
00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:08.904
Come here, kid!

135
00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:13.042
Let her go.

136
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:17.044
- Hey. Stop.
- Come on, Patrick.

137
00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:18.679
Don't do it.

138
00:11:18.681 --> 00:11:21.048
Don't do it.

139
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.819
It's over.

140
00:11:41.436 --> 00:11:43.069
- Fuck.
- Come on.

141
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:45.575
- You okay?
- Come on!

142
00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:56.883
No, no, no, no.

143
00:11:56.885 --> 00:11:58.618
Hey, did you see him?
Where'd he go?

144
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.654
Of course I saw him, shithead.
That's why I swerved.

145
00:12:00.656 --> 00:12:02.588
Did you see him get up?

146
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.792
Oh, look.

147
00:12:05.661 --> 00:12:07.097
This way.

148
00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:14.037
Here!

149
00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:19.875
Ah, shit.
He's in the river.

150
00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:23.544
I've never seen
anything like that.

151
00:12:23.546 --> 00:12:26.416
- How's he still alive?
- He isn't.

152
00:12:27.148 --> 00:12:29.116
We put at least
three bullets in him.

153
00:12:29.118 --> 00:12:31.151
He fell two stories.

154
00:12:31.153 --> 00:12:33.587
Look at how much blood
he lost.

155
00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:35.555
You saw his arm.
He can't swim like that.

156
00:12:35.557 --> 00:12:37.958
He'll drown,
if not hypothermia.

157
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.760
He's probably already dead.

158
00:12:39.762 --> 00:12:41.795
You saw it, right?
His eyes?

159
00:12:41.797 --> 00:12:44.667
- Saw what?
- He was getting off on it.

160
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:48.904
He isn't anymore.

161
00:12:49.872 --> 00:12:51.572
Trick Weaver is dead.

162
00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:54.710
We'll set up a perimeter,
but I doubt we'll find him.

163
00:12:57.613 --> 00:13:00.550
This is Sheriff Jayne.
I need K9 units...

164
00:13:12.861 --> 00:13:15.896
From interviewing
fellow students, teachers...

165
00:13:15.898 --> 00:13:18.866
"Trick was so quiet.
He'd never do that."

166
00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:21.133
The old "quiet one" cliché.

167
00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:24.804
"Trick was," and I quote,
"smart as fuck.

168
00:13:24.806 --> 00:13:26.772
Always made more sense
than the teachers."

169
00:13:26.774 --> 00:13:29.075
Ever get in trouble? Suspension,
detention, anything?

170
00:13:29.077 --> 00:13:30.843
Too smart to get in trouble.

171
00:13:30.845 --> 00:13:32.979
History teacher of 27 years

172
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:37.117
stated Trick often made
the teachers feel incompetent.

173
00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:38.785
What do we have to do
to get a picture of this kid?

174
00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:41.554
No Facebook,
no Instagram, no Twitter.

175
00:13:41.556 --> 00:13:43.857
If he used social media,
he was anonymous.

176
00:13:43.859 --> 00:13:45.825
Weaver skipped
his class photo.

177
00:13:45.827 --> 00:13:47.560
We asked the annual staff
to check the database,

178
00:13:47.562 --> 00:13:48.896
see if they had any candids.

179
00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:50.296
We also made an announcement
to the students,

180
00:13:50.298 --> 00:13:52.532
see if anybody had any photos
on their phones.

181
00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:54.001
So far, we got nothing.

182
00:13:54.003 --> 00:13:55.935
This is all they have
before the video cuts off.

183
00:13:55.937 --> 00:13:58.604
No footage of Trick getting up
or leaving the scene.

184
00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.677
There's no shadow movement.

185
00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:06.748
Really thin eyebrows.

186
00:14:08.883 --> 00:14:10.050
Thin lips.

187
00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:13.053
No.
Thick lips.

188
00:14:13.055 --> 00:14:14.186
Skinny face.

189
00:14:14.188 --> 00:14:15.888
Kind of
a hollowed-out face.

190
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.692
Black, roughed-up hair.

191
00:14:18.694 --> 00:14:20.861
- Scruffy.
- Deep-set eyes.

192
00:14:20.863 --> 00:14:22.029
He had green eyes.

193
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:24.231
- Beady.
- Blue eyes.

194
00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:27.637
Just really
kind-looking eyes.

195
00:14:33.942 --> 00:14:35.809
He could be anybody.

196
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:38.045
I saw him eyeing Trick
one day, and I was like,

197
00:14:38.047 --> 00:14:39.579
"You planning
on messing with Trick?"

198
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:42.115
Then Trick,
who had to be 50 yards away

199
00:14:42.117 --> 00:14:45.285
sitting at a picnic table,
turns and stares right at us.

200
00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:48.755
No way he could've heard me.
Hell, we both went pale.

201
00:14:48.757 --> 00:14:50.690
Troy was like, "Nah, man.
I ain't messing with Trick."

202
00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:52.224
And Troy messed
with everybody.

203
00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:54.928
We're wondering
if Patrick was bullied,

204
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.363
and we heard you might be
the man to talk to.

205
00:14:57.365 --> 00:14:59.866
No, no, I don't know who's
been shooting their mouth off.

206
00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:01.635
I ain't no bully.

207
00:15:01.637 --> 00:15:03.804
Maybe I get a little rough,
but I never touched Trick.

208
00:15:03.806 --> 00:15:07.373
Not him.
Until, you know, he lost it.

209
00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:09.309
I saw there was a fire poker
next to the fireplace

210
00:15:09.311 --> 00:15:11.078
when I was there,
so I just, like,

211
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.713
just one of those
animal instinct,

212
00:15:12.715 --> 00:15:14.213
just clean shot,
just right in the gut.

213
00:15:14.215 --> 00:15:16.083
I was dressed up
as a superhero.

214
00:15:16.085 --> 00:15:18.318
Little did I know you have to
become the hero of the night.

215
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.820
I saved a lot of people.

216
00:15:20.822 --> 00:15:22.021
Me.

217
00:15:22.023 --> 00:15:24.156
He was sweet, you know?

218
00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:26.859
I still can't believe
what happened.

219
00:15:26.861 --> 00:15:28.261
What about his folks?

220
00:15:28.263 --> 00:15:30.329
Did they know
he was like this?

221
00:15:30.331 --> 00:15:35.171
Or did they make him
this way?

222
00:15:46.715 --> 00:15:47.914
According to school records,

223
00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:50.250
this is
Patrick Weaver's address.

224
00:15:50.252 --> 00:15:51.818
Barge hasn't moved
in five years.

225
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.386
We don't know
where he actually lived.

226
00:15:53.388 --> 00:15:55.888
We don't even know if
Patrick Weaver's his real name.

227
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.790
How is that even possible?

228
00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.693
Kid goes to a school
for a whole year,

229
00:15:59.695 --> 00:16:01.828
and no one checks his address?

230
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.363
- No one ever met his parents?
- E-mails.

231
00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:06.400
Teachers spoke
with both parents by e-mail.

232
00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:08.171
E-mails?

233
00:16:09.872 --> 00:16:13.006
Denver,
it's been three weeks.

234
00:16:13.008 --> 00:16:14.907
I'm starting
to get some pressure.

235
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:18.145
There's too many unanswered
questions to close this case.

236
00:16:18.147 --> 00:16:19.780
And when were you gonna
tell me about

237
00:16:19.782 --> 00:16:21.714
the two-faced pumpkin mask?

238
00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:23.150
Who told you about that?

239
00:16:23.152 --> 00:16:24.751
The mask was stolen
from your evidence locker,

240
00:16:24.753 --> 00:16:26.218
and you don't
bother to tell me?

241
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.787
Because you would
assume it was him.

242
00:16:27.789 --> 00:16:30.390
- Of course I would.
- Trick Weaver is dead.

243
00:16:30.392 --> 00:16:32.629
Show me the body,
and I'll believe it.

244
00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:35.862
I'm not saying
I'll quit looking,

245
00:16:35.864 --> 00:16:38.298
but, Mike,
I got to put my resources

246
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.936
back on a county
that's been ignored.

247
00:18:07.388 --> 00:18:09.790
Check this out.

248
00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:12.893
Who is this guy?

249
00:18:12.895 --> 00:18:14.931
What the hell
are you supposed to be?

250
00:18:44.927 --> 00:18:46.129
Stupid kids.

251
00:19:15.523 --> 00:19:17.389
Six dead,
three injured.

252
00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:18.892
No one could I.D. him.

253
00:19:18.894 --> 00:19:20.292
They're not even sure
he's a student,

254
00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:22.364
but witnesses say
his face was painted.

255
00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:27.367
You don't really believe
it's Trick.

256
00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:28.868
We never found a body.

257
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.637
- W-We shot him, Mike.
- Yeah, we did.

258
00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:33.339
But don't you think
it's curious that our guy

259
00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:35.242
vanished into the river
after killing five teens,

260
00:19:35.244 --> 00:19:38.310
and a year later six teens
are killed on the same river?

261
00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:40.246
Do you think
he floated there?

262
00:19:40.248 --> 00:19:42.951
I got to take this.

263
00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:55.294
Everyone wants the
monster to live in the end.

264
00:19:55.296 --> 00:19:57.463
Why is that?

265
00:19:57.465 --> 00:20:00.200
Let's say he survived
the bullet wounds

266
00:20:00.202 --> 00:20:02.068
and the freezing water,

267
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.403
and you return each year

268
00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:08.107
to inflict revenge
as performance art.

269
00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:10.312
<i>Stop!</i>

270
00:20:12.147 --> 00:20:14.350
Trick's a regular boogeyman.

271
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.119
He's got a lot of fans online.
He's viral.

272
00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:22.023
Saw those already.
Looking for a thread.

273
00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:24.961
If there is one...

274
00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:28.163
...I can't find it.

275
00:20:29.497 --> 00:20:32.197
<i>Hey there, Tricksters.
Welcome back.</i>

276
00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:35.534
<i>It's that time of year.
You know what that means.</i>

277
00:20:35.536 --> 00:20:38.340
<i>Our favorite killer's
coming back on this Halloween.</i>

278
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.975
<i>Fear him.
Trick is coming.</i>

279
00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:45.614
<i>Fear Trick.</i>

280
00:20:56.224 --> 00:20:58.290
All three attacks
happened within towns

281
00:20:58.292 --> 00:21:00.659
along the river,
farther south each time.

282
00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:04.364
Tomorrow night,
it'll be one of these towns.

283
00:21:04.366 --> 00:21:06.232
With the FBI's help,
we can stop him.

284
00:21:06.234 --> 00:21:09.435
Trick wore a two-faced pumpkin
mask with face paint on it.

285
00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:11.538
In 2016, the assailant wore
a white demon mask,

286
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.672
face paint underneath.

287
00:21:12.674 --> 00:21:14.406
In 2017
it was a skull mask,

288
00:21:14.408 --> 00:21:16.076
and though we have
no witnesses,

289
00:21:16.078 --> 00:21:18.377
forensics confirmed that
there was paint in the mask.

290
00:21:18.379 --> 00:21:20.180
His makeup design
changes each year

291
00:21:20.182 --> 00:21:21.614
to hide the shape
of his face,

292
00:21:21.616 --> 00:21:25.284
but I have no doubt
all three were Trick.

293
00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:26.519
Why call him
by his nickname?

294
00:21:26.521 --> 00:21:28.288
I've located
every Patrick Weaver

295
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.656
born in the States
from '93 to 2005.

296
00:21:30.658 --> 00:21:33.559
Location, means, alibi...
none of them are him.

297
00:21:33.561 --> 00:21:35.462
The name is a fake.

298
00:21:35.464 --> 00:21:38.365
Look, I admit
it's an intriguing theory,

299
00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:40.466
but if it was the same guy,
you'd have DNA.

300
00:21:40.468 --> 00:21:44.136
We do have DNA.
Too much DNA.

301
00:21:44.138 --> 00:21:46.205
The masks recovered
in 2016 and 2017

302
00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:47.573
were covered in so much DNA,

303
00:21:47.575 --> 00:21:49.209
it was like
they were drug inside-out

304
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:50.577
across a gym floor.

305
00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:53.014
Does either of them
match 2015?

306
00:21:54.616 --> 00:21:57.183
- No.
- Do they match each other?

307
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:59.184
No, but he's doing that
on purpose to fuck with us.

308
00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:00.619
Don't you get it?

309
00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:03.455
DNA results have given you facts
you don't want,

310
00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:05.157
so you scream conspiracy.

311
00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:06.361
I'm not screaming.

312
00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:09.029
Look.

313
00:22:09.031 --> 00:22:11.798
You and the lady sheriff
discharged your weapons

314
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.200
five times into the guy.

315
00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:16.069
He fell 23 feet.

316
00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:18.538
And that was before he crawled
into a 32-degree river.

317
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.373
No offense, Detective,

318
00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:23.379
but the only thing
keeping this guy alive is you.

319
00:22:27.616 --> 00:22:29.549
Have you considered
a copycat?

320
00:22:29.551 --> 00:22:32.254
Of course I have.

321
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:37.389
The Internet refers to Trick
as some supernatural spirit

322
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:40.260
that comes back
every Halloween.

323
00:22:40.262 --> 00:22:41.828
And you don't
want to believe them, but...

324
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.129
But Occam's razor
and all that.

325
00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:45.498
All parts being equal,

326
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.232
the simplest solution
is most likely true.

327
00:22:47.234 --> 00:22:49.101
Sorry,
but an evil Halloween spirit

328
00:22:49.103 --> 00:22:50.136
isn't the simplest solution.

329
00:22:50.138 --> 00:22:51.503
And it's not the same kid.

330
00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:54.706
A lot of psychos out there
wanting infamy.

331
00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:57.612
Better than some school shooter,
but not by much.

332
00:23:01.082 --> 00:23:02.717
Look, it's midnight.

333
00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:07.386
Gonna hit the pisser.
Next round's on me.

334
00:23:07.388 --> 00:23:11.124
Yeah, right.
Happy Halloween!

335
00:23:15.563 --> 00:23:17.563
No porn in here,
pumpkin.

336
00:23:17.565 --> 00:23:18.697
That's your idea of porn?

337
00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:21.267
I used to work
at a cop bar,

338
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:23.569
and that is cop porn.

339
00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:26.138
Didn't allow it there,
and I won't allow it here.

340
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.109
And these two special agents
should absolutely know better.

341
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:31.778
Touché.

342
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.447
Really impressive how you
"Cocktailed" that vodka bottle.

343
00:23:35.449 --> 00:23:38.751
Did you just turn
a Tom Cruise movie into a verb?

344
00:23:38.753 --> 00:23:40.220
I did.

345
00:23:40.222 --> 00:23:43.255
I approve.
Next round's on me.

346
00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:44.323
Mm!

347
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.188
Wanting something to be true
just doesn't make it true.

348
00:24:22.531 --> 00:24:25.301
Why did Swift
send me this?

349
00:24:32.474 --> 00:24:36.811
What?
What the fuck?

350
00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:44.450
Shit.

351
00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:46.653
It's Swift.
Come on.

352
00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:51.191
Jesus!
Swift!

353
00:24:51.193 --> 00:24:52.194
Fuck!

354
00:24:57.232 --> 00:24:58.634
Swift!
Jesus!

355
00:25:02.837 --> 00:25:06.239
Hold on. Hold on, Sam.
We've got to...

356
00:25:06.241 --> 00:25:08.577
It's okay.
It's okay.

357
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:11.180
Oh, my...

358
00:25:12.513 --> 00:25:14.313
It's all right.
It's all right.

359
00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:16.816
You're gonna be okay, man.
Hang on!

360
00:25:16.818 --> 00:25:18.283
Hang on!

361
00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:20.252
It's gonna
cut his head off.

362
00:25:22.323 --> 00:25:24.991
We got it.
Denver, you got that?

363
00:25:24.993 --> 00:25:26.392
It's too heavy.

364
00:25:26.394 --> 00:25:29.294
Sam, let me... We got this.
Hang on.

365
00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:30.665
We got you.

366
00:25:39.573 --> 00:25:42.308
Denver!
Agh!

367
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.876
We're here.
Sam, just hang on.

368
00:25:43.878 --> 00:25:45.979
We got this, Sam.
Almost there, Sam.

369
00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:47.782
Come on, man.

370
00:26:03.465 --> 00:26:06.331
Oh, fuck!
Sam!

371
00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:07.500
Shit!

372
00:26:07.502 --> 00:26:09.705
God, fuck...

373
00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:14.040
Ah!
Fuck, man.

374
00:26:14.042 --> 00:26:16.541
- I got you.
- God, fuck.

375
00:26:16.543 --> 00:26:18.011
Hold it, hold it.

376
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:30.490
Agent Tina Mendez!
There's an officer down!

377
00:26:30.492 --> 00:26:32.658
Yes, Piccirilli Avenue.

378
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.961
Fat Lou's bar.
One officer's down.

379
00:26:34.963 --> 00:26:36.264
Yes, right away!

380
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.668
Denver!

381
00:26:42.469 --> 00:26:44.773
Fuck.

382
00:26:46.507 --> 00:26:47.773
Oh, shit.
Okay.

383
00:26:47.775 --> 00:26:49.608
Try to stay calm.
Try to stay calm.

384
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.380
I'm gonna call it in.

385
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.847
This is Detective Mike Denver.

386
00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:57.716
Got two officers down
at Fat Lou's bar.

387
00:26:57.718 --> 00:26:59.520
Come quick!

388
00:27:03.524 --> 00:27:05.090
He's right there.
Help's on the way.

389
00:27:05.092 --> 00:27:07.263
Denver...

390
00:27:10.497 --> 00:27:12.698
Shit.

391
00:27:16.338 --> 00:27:18.937
Please don't.
Please don't.

392
00:27:36.057 --> 00:27:38.558
Mendez, Mendez.

393
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.495
Oh, fuck.

394
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.967
- Hey.
- Hey, Cheryl. How's it going?

395
00:28:55.969 --> 00:28:57.736
- Not bad. How are you?
- Good. Oh, I'm well.

396
00:28:57.738 --> 00:28:59.771
- I'm well. How's your dad?
- He's all right.

397
00:28:59.773 --> 00:29:01.473
- Oh, okay.
- Thanks for asking.

398
00:29:01.475 --> 00:29:03.041
- I'll see you.
- Sure, see you.

399
00:29:03.043 --> 00:29:07.113
They got my goddamn barn door,
Cheryl.

400
00:29:07.115 --> 00:29:09.214
Who steals a barn door?

401
00:29:09.216 --> 00:29:11.517
Well, it does have
sentimental value, Mr. Talbott.

402
00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:14.153
Most kids I know carved
their name into that barn door,

403
00:29:14.155 --> 00:29:15.821
like a rite of passage.

404
00:29:15.823 --> 00:29:17.623
Think I don't know that?

405
00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:19.459
Over 40 years
they've been doing it.

406
00:29:19.461 --> 00:29:21.860
I only ever got rid
of one name.

407
00:29:21.862 --> 00:29:26.033
Burned it off.
That damn door was special.

408
00:29:27.034 --> 00:29:28.467
Careful, Talbott.

409
00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:29.668
Folks will think
you have a heart.

410
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.637
- Doubt that.
- Thanks.

411
00:29:32.639 --> 00:29:34.008
You seen Nicky?

412
00:29:37.544 --> 00:29:38.610
Jeez!

413
00:29:38.612 --> 00:29:40.646
Why you take self-defense?

414
00:29:40.648 --> 00:29:44.483
Take Bikram
like the rest of us.

415
00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:45.851
Namaste, my ass.

416
00:29:45.853 --> 00:29:49.155
What do you want,
college girl?

417
00:29:49.157 --> 00:29:51.991
So, Troy?

418
00:29:51.993 --> 00:29:54.193
Oh, Troy sent you.

419
00:29:54.195 --> 00:29:57.230
Great, got a message for him...
Drop dead.

420
00:29:57.232 --> 00:29:59.232
Troy says he was
just studying with her.

421
00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:02.001
Cheryl, I studied with Troy
all senior year.

422
00:30:02.003 --> 00:30:04.703
He algebras
with his dick out.

423
00:30:04.705 --> 00:30:07.005
"Drop dead" message
still stands.

424
00:30:07.007 --> 00:30:08.808
Finally.

425
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.210
I'm tired of being a go-between
for you and that loser.

426
00:30:11.212 --> 00:30:13.078
Oh, I got the twerps
on Halloween.

427
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.248
Want to take them
to the maze with me?

428
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.582
Greg and Janice
in a haunted maze?

429
00:30:17.584 --> 00:30:19.117
They're gonna have
little heart attacks.

430
00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:22.588
I know, right?
How funny will that be?

431
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.759
Nicky.

432
00:30:35.802 --> 00:30:38.136
Detective Denver.

433
00:30:38.138 --> 00:30:40.606
Hey.
Just Mike now, Cheryl.

434
00:30:40.608 --> 00:30:42.541
What are you doing here?

435
00:30:42.543 --> 00:30:44.109
I heard you got a scholarship
to State.

436
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:47.646
I transferred back
after dad's accident.

437
00:30:47.648 --> 00:30:49.848
It's just the two of us.
Wanted to be there for him.

438
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.318
Yeah, I get it.
He's lucky to have you.

439
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.287
- How's he doing?
- Good days and bad.

440
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:57.022
But we're getting there.

441
00:30:57.024 --> 00:30:59.058
So how are you?

442
00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:03.194
Since the FBI decided
to kindly force my retirement,

443
00:31:03.196 --> 00:31:05.764
packed up and ready to follow
the advice

444
00:31:05.766 --> 00:31:08.267
of the immortal Fleetwood Mac
and go my own way.

445
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:10.202
But tomorrow's Halloween.

446
00:31:10.204 --> 00:31:14.176
You aren't going anywhere
that takes you from this.

447
00:31:18.312 --> 00:31:19.945
All these are Trick Weaver?

448
00:31:19.947 --> 00:31:21.713
It's a theory.

449
00:31:21.715 --> 00:31:22.948
My theory, anyways.

450
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.050
You really think
he's still after you?

451
00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:27.819
No.
I don't <i>think</i> he's after me.

452
00:31:27.821 --> 00:31:29.824
That's why I've got to go.

453
00:31:30.858 --> 00:31:33.792
Well, we'll miss you.

454
00:31:33.794 --> 00:31:34.929
Thanks.

455
00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:39.698
Hey.

456
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.899
Take care of your pop.

457
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:43.071
Take care of yourself.

458
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.310
- See you, Cheryl.
- Thanks, Talbott.

459
00:31:52.647 --> 00:31:54.680
Her dad
weren't no accident.

460
00:31:54.682 --> 00:31:55.880
Shut up, Talbott.

461
00:31:55.882 --> 00:31:58.250
You shut up.

462
00:31:58.252 --> 00:32:00.319
Her daddy strolled up
that factory roof,

463
00:32:00.321 --> 00:32:02.887
jumped right the goddamn off.

464
00:32:02.889 --> 00:32:04.223
That's why the son of a bitch

465
00:32:04.225 --> 00:32:06.892
turned that surveillance tape
off first.

466
00:32:06.894 --> 00:32:09.928
It weren't no accident.

467
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.063
You know that's why
nobody likes you, right?

468
00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:14.802
Everybody likes me.

469
00:32:19.206 --> 00:32:21.807
All right.
Just breathe, rookie.

470
00:32:21.809 --> 00:32:22.808
Just breathe.

471
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.277
Why?

472
00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:28.146
Why would someone
take his eyeballs?

473
00:32:28.148 --> 00:32:30.081
Keep it together, Slater.

474
00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:31.887
- Keep it together.
- Hey, boss.

475
00:32:34.022 --> 00:32:36.821
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff.

476
00:32:36.823 --> 00:32:38.357
Keep it together, Slater.

477
00:32:38.359 --> 00:32:40.859
What do we got?

478
00:32:40.861 --> 00:32:42.293
Well, red truck
is the victims.

479
00:32:42.295 --> 00:32:43.896
He worked across the street,

480
00:32:43.898 --> 00:32:47.101
but somebody else
had a different plan for him.

481
00:32:48.703 --> 00:32:50.970
I'll find him, get him here.

482
00:32:50.972 --> 00:32:53.308
He's leaving town,
so make it fast.

483
00:33:06.454 --> 00:33:10.088
Jesus.
He's back.

484
00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.290
Don't start with that.

485
00:33:11.292 --> 00:33:12.457
Then why'd
you bring me here?

486
00:33:12.459 --> 00:33:14.993
Your name's
on the wall, Mike.

487
00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:16.395
Exactly.

488
00:33:16.397 --> 00:33:17.963
You made a lot of enemies
over the years.

489
00:33:17.965 --> 00:33:19.400
It could be any one of them.

490
00:33:30.945 --> 00:33:32.978
You're doing well.
You're doing well.

491
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.217
Okay, start off easy.

492
00:33:40.088 --> 00:33:41.787
That's right.

493
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:44.423
Zebra.
Very good.

494
00:33:44.425 --> 00:33:47.792
Okay.
Let's try another one.

495
00:33:47.794 --> 00:33:48.863
Let's see.

496
00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:52.266
Red.

497
00:33:54.936 --> 00:33:56.402
Okay.

498
00:33:56.404 --> 00:33:59.804
This is an orange.
It's the color orange.

499
00:33:59.806 --> 00:34:02.208
This is an apple.

500
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.909
It's okay.

501
00:34:03.911 --> 00:34:07.349
Plus, orange and red
are pretty similar, right?

502
00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:12.817
How are
my two favorite people?

503
00:34:12.819 --> 00:34:15.855
Look, Dad.
Do you remember his name?

504
00:34:15.857 --> 00:34:18.924
Doc Steve.

505
00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:22.360
Dr. Steve.
Yes, right.

506
00:34:22.362 --> 00:34:23.964
Cheryl, can I talk to you?

507
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.840
Look, this is gonna sound
worse than it is, all right,

508
00:34:34.842 --> 00:34:38.143
but insurance
has refused to pay

509
00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:41.514
'cause there's an investigation
into the cause of the accident.

510
00:34:41.516 --> 00:34:44.150
- They think he jumped.
- Yeah.

511
00:34:44.152 --> 00:34:47.152
- He would never...
- I know.

512
00:34:47.154 --> 00:34:50.855
Back in the old days
I used to go to conventions,

513
00:34:50.857 --> 00:34:52.891
talk to patients
about treatments.

514
00:34:52.893 --> 00:34:55.494
Now we start with billing
and insurance.

515
00:34:55.496 --> 00:34:57.395
Look, the hospital knows
he didn't jump.

516
00:34:57.397 --> 00:34:59.364
And so does the factory
for that matter,

517
00:34:59.366 --> 00:35:01.000
who have agreed
to continue to pay

518
00:35:01.002 --> 00:35:02.967
until this whole insurance
situation is worked out.

519
00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:04.503
I just wanted you
to hear it from me

520
00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:06.204
so you don't get stressed out
when they contact you.

521
00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:09.340
- Thank you.
- Sure.

522
00:35:11.145 --> 00:35:12.813
Dad?

523
00:35:20.087 --> 00:35:21.922
What is it?

524
00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:28.092
There's nothing there.
It's okay.

525
00:35:28.094 --> 00:35:29.363
It's okay.

526
00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:02.862
"Jayne, Green. Meet me
at the old crane barge at noon."

527
00:36:02.864 --> 00:36:05.965
What?
I didn't send that.

528
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:16.243
Trick.

529
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:03.621
- Denver?
- Jayne.

530
00:37:03.623 --> 00:37:05.623
Get to the barge.
Green is being set up.

531
00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:07.558
Shit.
You didn't send that e-mail?

532
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.559
No, no, no.

533
00:37:34.054 --> 00:37:37.625
Denver!
Sheriff Jayne!

534
00:37:41.027 --> 00:37:43.098
Hello?

535
00:39:03.576 --> 00:39:06.411
Green!
Green!

536
00:39:06.413 --> 00:39:08.079
Green, you in there?

537
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:11.583
Yeah!
I'm back here by the shed.

538
00:39:11.585 --> 00:39:14.820
Denver didn't send that e-mail!
Get out of there!

539
00:39:14.822 --> 00:39:17.759
Jayne, Denver was right.
You got to come see this.

540
00:39:24.498 --> 00:39:25.766
Green!

541
00:39:32.406 --> 00:39:33.806
Oh...
Oh, God.

542
00:39:33.808 --> 00:39:37.842
Radio's busted.
Call an ambulance.

543
00:39:37.844 --> 00:39:39.511
It'll take them
15 to get here.

544
00:39:39.513 --> 00:39:42.181
I'll have you there in five.

545
00:39:42.183 --> 00:39:45.353
This is gonna hurt.
Okay?

546
00:39:54.194 --> 00:39:55.460
Come out.

547
00:39:55.462 --> 00:39:57.429
Give me your weight.

548
00:39:57.431 --> 00:39:59.801
I got you.
I got you.

549
00:40:01.469 --> 00:40:03.302
Okay.
All right.

550
00:40:03.304 --> 00:40:05.404
Shit.

551
00:40:07.607 --> 00:40:09.407
- Fast as I can.
- Oh, God.

552
00:40:16.317 --> 00:40:17.217
Get back!

553
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:22.820
What?

554
00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:24.790
Is it Trick?

555
00:40:24.792 --> 00:40:26.324
Pull your gun.

556
00:40:26.326 --> 00:40:27.860
- It hurts.
- Do it.

557
00:40:27.862 --> 00:40:29.230
I'm gonna wing you around.

558
00:40:37.337 --> 00:40:40.441
We lost him.

559
00:41:04.864 --> 00:41:06.831
What the hell is that?

560
00:41:06.833 --> 00:41:08.233
Doesn't matter.
It's just...

561
00:41:08.235 --> 00:41:09.800
Got to just get you
to the hospital.

562
00:41:09.802 --> 00:41:11.339
I got you, I got you.

563
00:41:17.645 --> 00:41:18.710
Keep talking, Green.

564
00:41:18.712 --> 00:41:21.380
Tell me about something.

565
00:41:21.382 --> 00:41:22.880
I met a girl.

566
00:41:22.882 --> 00:41:25.250
A girl, huh?

567
00:41:25.252 --> 00:41:28.288
Do tell.
But do it while we drive.

568
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:38.699
Oh, no, no.
Shit!

569
00:41:39.732 --> 00:41:41.802
Shit. Get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

570
00:41:54.315 --> 00:41:56.885
Oh, fucking God.

571
00:42:02.922 --> 00:42:05.592
Chickenshit!
I'm right here!

572
00:42:29.382 --> 00:42:32.717
It's Trick.
Has to be.

573
00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:37.288
Internet said he was back.
Psycho's viral.

574
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:38.422
He did this.

575
00:42:38.424 --> 00:42:39.991
He did not.
Weaver's dead.

576
00:42:39.993 --> 00:42:42.393
- This is a copycat.
- Yeah?

577
00:42:42.395 --> 00:42:44.596
- Yeah.
- Maybe you're right.

578
00:42:44.598 --> 00:42:48.500
But where's Denver?
Maybe he did it.

579
00:42:48.502 --> 00:42:50.802
Trick follows him
like a shadow, right?

580
00:42:50.804 --> 00:42:52.307
Maybe Denver's Trick.

581
00:42:53.007 --> 00:42:56.842
Shut the fuck up, Slater.
Do your job.

582
00:42:56.844 --> 00:42:58.509
- Come on, rookie.
- Sorry, Sheriff.

583
00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:00.545
- Come on.
- Sheriff...

584
00:43:00.547 --> 00:43:02.650
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Let's go.

585
00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:22.936
I'm so sorry.

586
00:43:25.706 --> 00:43:27.809
Keep thinking I'll wake up.

587
00:43:29.409 --> 00:43:30.944
He was a good kid.

588
00:43:32.913 --> 00:43:34.846
This is one of the feds

589
00:43:34.848 --> 00:43:36.750
that got killed
last year, right?

590
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.620
Reason you lost your badge?

591
00:43:41.422 --> 00:43:43.621
Yeah.

592
00:43:43.623 --> 00:43:44.822
He's trying to
make a statement.

593
00:43:44.824 --> 00:43:46.558
Trying?

594
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.527
He's made
his fucking statement, Mike.

595
00:43:48.529 --> 00:43:52.364
- Green is dead.
- I know that.

596
00:43:52.366 --> 00:43:54.866
This...

597
00:43:54.868 --> 00:43:56.634
This is beyond abnormal.

598
00:43:56.636 --> 00:43:58.969
What does that even mean?

599
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:00.838
He murdered your deputy
with a gravestone

600
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.873
of a fed I got killed.

601
00:44:02.875 --> 00:44:04.909
Who does that?

602
00:44:04.911 --> 00:44:07.281
<i>What</i> does that?

603
00:44:10.384 --> 00:44:11.750
Look...

604
00:44:11.752 --> 00:44:13.719
I've never been a believer.

605
00:44:13.721 --> 00:44:17.556
Ghosts, Bigfoot, aliens.
God, Satan.

606
00:44:17.558 --> 00:44:19.523
I believe what I can see
and what I can touch.

607
00:44:19.525 --> 00:44:21.629
But this...

608
00:44:22.962 --> 00:44:24.731
This?

609
00:44:26.632 --> 00:44:28.799
This is pure evil.

610
00:44:28.801 --> 00:44:31.969
That kid
is goddamn darkness personified.

611
00:44:31.971 --> 00:44:34.005
I told you,
I believe it's Trick,

612
00:44:34.007 --> 00:44:36.878
but don't expect me
to jump on the devil wagon.

613
00:44:38.846 --> 00:44:40.481
A curfew won't work,
will it?

614
00:44:43.049 --> 00:44:45.083
Maybe if I leave town,
he'll follow.

615
00:44:45.085 --> 00:44:46.951
I'll lead him
away from here.

616
00:44:46.953 --> 00:44:49.154
No, he's past that,
and you know it.

617
00:44:49.156 --> 00:44:52.424
He's marked his territory.
He's made his challenge.

618
00:44:52.426 --> 00:44:54.362
So, what do you suggest?

619
00:44:55.828 --> 00:44:58.630
I know a place we can go.

620
00:44:58.632 --> 00:45:00.132
Somewhere we control.

621
00:45:00.134 --> 00:45:04.436
And when he comes for us,
evil or not,

622
00:45:04.438 --> 00:45:06.374
we'll make sure he doesn't
walk away this time.

623
00:45:10.444 --> 00:45:11.942
Smooth Jonny
in the house!

624
00:45:11.944 --> 00:45:14.813
- Whoo!
- There we go.

625
00:45:14.815 --> 00:45:16.014
Yo, I know you're not...

626
00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:17.648
- Hey, there he is.
- Give me that.

627
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:18.983
Forgot about Nicky, man.

628
00:45:18.985 --> 00:45:22.087
She a real piece of work.
That shit nuts.

629
00:45:22.089 --> 00:45:24.891
Hey.
To Trick Weaver.

630
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.427
I'm glad you're dead!

631
00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:31.596
Yeah!

632
00:45:31.598 --> 00:45:33.697
And... And... And...

633
00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:35.500
And here's to Troy.

634
00:45:35.502 --> 00:45:37.969
The man, the myth, the legend.

635
00:45:37.971 --> 00:45:42.706
Skewered
the Benton High School slasher.

636
00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:44.509
To the hero.

637
00:45:44.511 --> 00:45:45.877
To the man!

638
00:45:45.879 --> 00:45:48.212
To Troy?!

639
00:45:48.214 --> 00:45:49.748
To Troy!

640
00:45:53.654 --> 00:45:54.953
Yo, quick.
Shut up, hold up.

641
00:45:54.955 --> 00:45:56.154
<i>Could this be Trick Weaver?</i>

642
00:45:56.156 --> 00:45:57.922
<i>Trick Weaver is dead.</i>

643
00:45:57.924 --> 00:45:59.757
<i>But, Sheriff,
your deputy was killed</i>

644
00:45:59.759 --> 00:46:02.027
<i>with the gravestone
of federal agent Tina Mendez,</i>

645
00:46:02.029 --> 00:46:04.762
<i>the agent whose death
led to Mike Denver's firing,</i>

646
00:46:04.764 --> 00:46:07.532
<i>and now we have sources
informing us that Denver's name</i>

647
00:46:07.534 --> 00:46:09.099
<i>was written in blood
at the rest stop.</i>

648
00:46:09.101 --> 00:46:10.502
<i>What sources?</i>

649
00:46:10.504 --> 00:46:13.038
<i>So you don't deny it?</i>

650
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.978
<i>Like I said,
Trick Weaver is dead.</i>

651
00:46:20.681 --> 00:46:23.681
What?
Chill.

652
00:46:23.683 --> 00:46:25.784
The dude's dead.
Trust me.

653
00:46:25.786 --> 00:46:28.253
I don't know, man.
Never found the body.

654
00:46:28.255 --> 00:46:30.188
Trick Weaver could still be
coming back for you, man.

655
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.922
- No, man.
- No, no, what if...

656
00:46:31.924 --> 00:46:33.958
- What if... Shit...
- Trick's dead, yo.

657
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.960
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.

658
00:46:35.962 --> 00:46:38.563
So you're not worried
at all?

659
00:46:38.565 --> 00:46:40.197
- Ha!
- No way.

660
00:46:40.199 --> 00:46:42.904
Not just a little bit?

661
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:47.105
Just get another bottle
and hit Talbott's?

662
00:46:47.107 --> 00:46:48.639
Fuckin' A.
Halloween.

663
00:46:48.641 --> 00:46:50.808
- Hell yeah.
- Keep this party going?

664
00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.512
Old man Talbott's
Halloween horror marathon.

665
00:46:53.514 --> 00:46:54.913
What?!
What?!

666
00:46:54.915 --> 00:46:56.181
Blood and guts
from dusk till dawn!

667
00:46:57.918 --> 00:47:00.951
Blood and guts!
Blood and guts! Blood and guts!

668
00:47:00.953 --> 00:47:02.556
Let's go!

669
00:47:31.951 --> 00:47:33.150
Why here?

670
00:47:33.152 --> 00:47:34.018
It's where it all started.

671
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:35.686
Plus the place is empty.

672
00:47:35.688 --> 00:47:37.788
Nobody bought it
after Cheryl's family moved?

673
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.190
Would you
want to live here?

674
00:47:39.192 --> 00:47:40.659
Would I want to live

675
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:41.659
where this evil prick
got his start?

676
00:47:41.661 --> 00:47:43.061
- Hard pass.
- "Evil."

677
00:47:43.063 --> 00:47:44.795
Mike, you got to cut that word
from your vocab.

678
00:47:44.797 --> 00:47:46.264
There is no evil.

679
00:47:46.266 --> 00:47:48.132
Look, forget my assumptions.
Consider the facts.

680
00:47:48.134 --> 00:47:49.300
How many times
did we shoot him?

681
00:47:49.302 --> 00:47:50.869
How many stories
did he fall?

682
00:47:50.871 --> 00:47:52.070
How cold was that water?

683
00:47:52.072 --> 00:47:53.771
No family, no history,
no future.

684
00:47:53.773 --> 00:47:55.873
And yet he's the poisonous fog
that rolls in

685
00:47:55.875 --> 00:47:58.275
and kills everyone without
rhyme, reason, or remorse.

686
00:47:58.277 --> 00:47:59.978
You're confusing evil
with crazy.

687
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.146
This isn't crazy.

688
00:48:02.148 --> 00:48:03.815
I know crazy.
Cops are crazy.

689
00:48:03.817 --> 00:48:07.117
You're right.
Cops <i>are</i> crazy.

690
00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:10.855
But it's different 'cause
we're not alone in our crazy.

691
00:48:10.857 --> 00:48:13.190
I play Tuesday-night hearts
with cops.

692
00:48:13.192 --> 00:48:15.960
I eat with cops.
I bowl with cops.

693
00:48:15.962 --> 00:48:17.161
I fuck cops.

694
00:48:17.163 --> 00:48:20.030
We may be crazy,
but we're not alone.

695
00:48:20.032 --> 00:48:21.333
But Trick is.

696
00:48:21.335 --> 00:48:25.270
His crazy is alone
and methodical.

697
00:48:25.272 --> 00:48:27.005
He can join a Nazi group
on Facebook,

698
00:48:27.007 --> 00:48:30.174
even build his rep in the feeds,
but not as himself.

699
00:48:30.176 --> 00:48:33.244
No, the only ones
he shows himself to

700
00:48:33.246 --> 00:48:34.779
are those hunting him.

701
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:37.748
He needs you.
And me.

702
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:41.018
The Internet isn't his audience.
We are.

703
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.989
So we stop believing
and he just goes away?

704
00:48:44.991 --> 00:48:46.757
That type of thinking
will get you dead.

705
00:48:46.759 --> 00:48:49.661
Oh, Trick is real.
But think for a second.

706
00:48:49.663 --> 00:48:51.599
He's not always Trick,
is he?

707
00:48:52.766 --> 00:48:54.632
Every day's not Halloween.

708
00:48:54.634 --> 00:48:56.870
What's he do
when he's not taunting you?

709
00:48:58.138 --> 00:48:59.770
Take it slow.
He could be in there.

710
00:48:59.772 --> 00:49:01.206
County pays
for a security system.

711
00:49:01.208 --> 00:49:02.674
No one can open a door

712
00:49:02.676 --> 00:49:04.808
or window without me
knowing about it.

713
00:49:14.688 --> 00:49:16.954
What was that you said
about getting ahead of him?

714
00:49:16.956 --> 00:49:19.391
Wan, I need you and Slater
at Cheryl's old house.

715
00:49:19.393 --> 00:49:21.726
Now we know what he's doing
in the off-season.

716
00:49:21.728 --> 00:49:23.798
Ten-four, Sheriff. On our way.

717
00:49:25.431 --> 00:49:27.398
I can't believe this kid
was right under my nose

718
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.803
and I never knew it.

719
00:49:51.824 --> 00:49:53.924
Talbott's barn door.

720
00:49:53.926 --> 00:49:55.293
You know in 40 years,

721
00:49:55.295 --> 00:49:57.362
Talbott only removed one name
from this thing?

722
00:49:58.764 --> 00:50:00.701
He's told the story often
enough.

723
00:50:07.074 --> 00:50:10.043
Someone didn't
want to be forgotten.

724
00:50:35.235 --> 00:50:39.373
Your windows and doors were
alarmed, so he dug his way in.

725
00:50:40.373 --> 00:50:43.041
Sheriff, pulling up now.

726
00:50:43.043 --> 00:50:44.078
Copy that.

727
00:50:48.281 --> 00:50:50.014
- Deputy Wan, Slater.
- Sir.

728
00:50:50.016 --> 00:50:51.782
- Denver.
- You sure he was here?

729
00:50:51.784 --> 00:50:53.784
- Yeah, he's been here.
- And we think he'll be back.

730
00:50:53.786 --> 00:50:55.453
So I want you both to...

731
00:50:55.455 --> 00:50:57.387
Where's your SUV?

732
00:51:02.161 --> 00:51:04.962
Have I seen a kid in makeup?

733
00:51:04.964 --> 00:51:08.366
You're shitting me, right?
They're all in makeup.

734
00:51:08.368 --> 00:51:10.802
It's goddamn Halloween,
Deputy Reddick.

735
00:51:10.804 --> 00:51:13.837
Well, regardless, Sheriff wants
eyes and ears here tonight.

736
00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:16.974
I got all the eyes and ears
you need right here.

737
00:51:16.976 --> 00:51:19.043
But if I were you,

738
00:51:19.045 --> 00:51:22.380
I'd go around back,
check out the maze.

739
00:51:22.382 --> 00:51:26.851
Folks tend to get rowdy when
they've soiled their jeans.

740
00:51:26.853 --> 00:51:28.987
Okay, Mr. Talbott.
I'll go do that.

741
00:51:28.989 --> 00:51:30.224
- Thank you.
- All right.

742
00:51:31.391 --> 00:51:33.023
1025 APB.

743
00:51:33.025 --> 00:51:34.491
All units be on the lookout

744
00:51:34.493 --> 00:51:37.195
for the stolen 2010
white Ford Expedition

745
00:51:37.197 --> 00:51:39.063
belonging to Mike Denver.

746
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:47.271
Scary.

747
00:51:47.273 --> 00:51:49.007
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

748
00:51:49.009 --> 00:51:50.974
I'm gonna grab the tickets.

749
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:57.482
Greg!
Come on!

750
00:51:57.484 --> 00:51:59.786
You're never gonna see
that movie!

751
00:52:01.922 --> 00:52:04.291
He does not listen.

752
00:52:11.831 --> 00:52:13.163
Oh, stop.

753
00:52:13.165 --> 00:52:15.266
You told Cheryl you've seen this
a hundred times.

754
00:52:15.268 --> 00:52:16.601
Why can't I see it once?

755
00:52:16.603 --> 00:52:18.369
I don't want to see it one time.

756
00:52:18.371 --> 00:52:19.837
You want to be scared?

757
00:52:19.839 --> 00:52:22.139
The maze is where
the real monsters are...

758
00:52:22.141 --> 00:52:23.474
not some dumb movie.

759
00:52:23.476 --> 00:52:25.275
I don't want to be scared
neither.

760
00:52:25.277 --> 00:52:26.511
All right, you guys.

761
00:52:26.513 --> 00:52:28.846
I got the tickets.
Everyone ready?

762
00:52:28.848 --> 00:52:31.248
- Yes.
- No.

763
00:52:41.927 --> 00:52:44.161
- Which way?
- This way.

764
00:52:47.032 --> 00:52:48.301
Greg!

765
00:52:49.935 --> 00:52:51.869
Who the hell are these people?

766
00:52:51.871 --> 00:52:54.072
Oh, man. They look like
they're on a shitty date.

767
00:52:55.976 --> 00:52:58.108
They're having
a rough time, man.

768
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.210
Hey, how you doing?
You guys on a date or something?

769
00:53:00.212 --> 00:53:02.947
Let's go.
Oh, shit.

770
00:53:02.949 --> 00:53:05.949
Here we go. All right, boys.
You know the plan, right?

771
00:53:05.951 --> 00:53:08.386
Same thing.
Ready to rock 'n' roll?

772
00:53:08.388 --> 00:53:10.221
Okay. You walk around the thing.
You get in there.

773
00:53:10.223 --> 00:53:11.922
- Five on five. Got it?
- We got it.

774
00:53:11.924 --> 00:53:14.358
Let's go. Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Go, go, go.

775
00:53:23.435 --> 00:53:25.469
Oh, hey, Mr. Talbott.

776
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:27.304
- Troy.
- One, please.

777
00:53:27.306 --> 00:53:30.440
One?
Oh, that's great.

778
00:53:30.442 --> 00:53:32.944
Troy, got to tell you,
I'm pleasantly surprised

779
00:53:32.946 --> 00:53:36.114
to see you here without all your
emotional support animals

780
00:53:36.116 --> 00:53:37.614
that you call friends.

781
00:53:37.616 --> 00:53:41.252
Could it be
you are actually growing up,

782
00:53:41.254 --> 00:53:43.221
leaving high school behind?

783
00:53:43.223 --> 00:53:45.426
I graduated four years ago,
but...

784
00:53:46.058 --> 00:53:47.558
I hadn't noticed.

785
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.960
Here.

786
00:53:48.962 --> 00:53:51.297
Have yourself a mask.

787
00:53:52.031 --> 00:53:53.499
All the kids have them.

788
00:53:57.569 --> 00:53:59.072
Good seeing you, Mr. T.

789
00:53:59.505 --> 00:54:01.239
- You too, Troy.
- Mm-hmm.

790
00:54:01.241 --> 00:54:03.476
- Thanks for coming.
- Any time.

791
00:54:33.739 --> 00:54:35.273
Hey, Sheriff.
It's Reddick.

792
00:54:35.275 --> 00:54:37.976
I have eyes on Denver's
missing wheels.

793
00:54:42.581 --> 00:54:44.614
Copy that, Iris.
What's your location?

794
00:54:48.288 --> 00:54:50.157
Deputy Reddick,
location, please.

795
00:54:56.629 --> 00:55:00.000
I'm at the church,
in pursuit of potential suspect.

796
00:55:06.772 --> 00:55:09.542
Reddick, do not pursue
without backup.

797
00:55:20.052 --> 00:55:23.186
Copy that, Sheriff.

798
00:55:23.188 --> 00:55:24.221
Come back, Reddick.

799
00:55:24.223 --> 00:55:26.123
Deputy Reddick.

800
00:55:26.125 --> 00:55:28.058
Reddick, report.

801
00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.595
- It's starting.
- Shit.

802
00:55:40.373 --> 00:55:42.806
- Hey, shitheads. Get in here.
- Freezing as fuck, dude.

803
00:55:42.808 --> 00:55:45.208
Looked like old man Talbott
scared the shit out of you.

804
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:46.710
Talbott doesn't scare anyone,
bro.

805
00:55:46.712 --> 00:55:48.212
- You kidding me? Oh, yeah?
- What you talking about?

806
00:55:48.214 --> 00:55:49.346
- You're a tough guy, huh?
- Yeah, hit me, man.

807
00:55:49.348 --> 00:55:51.282
I'll throw you down the st...

808
00:55:51.284 --> 00:55:52.817
Oh, fuck.

809
00:55:52.819 --> 00:55:55.219
Tell you what, Mr. Troy.

810
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:58.822
You and your shithead five
can make a healthy donation

811
00:55:58.824 --> 00:56:00.590
to tonight's cause,

812
00:56:00.592 --> 00:56:04.161
or I can call
that nice Deputy Reddick,

813
00:56:04.163 --> 00:56:05.563
and she can read you
your rights.

814
00:56:05.565 --> 00:56:07.831
What do you think?

815
00:56:07.833 --> 00:56:09.703
- Uh...
- Pay up.

816
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.107
Get it out. Get it out.
Hurry up.

817
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:17.442
This isn't so bad.

818
00:56:17.444 --> 00:56:19.811
Are you insane?
I can't stand this.

819
00:56:19.813 --> 00:56:21.212
Can't stand what?

820
00:56:21.214 --> 00:56:23.313
You haven't opened your eyes
since...

821
00:56:33.826 --> 00:56:35.659
Maybe we should go back.

822
00:56:35.661 --> 00:56:37.427
I thought you wanted to
be scared.

823
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.250
I don't want to be here anymore!

824
00:56:59.284 --> 00:57:01.284
- Here. Help her. I'll get him.
- I want to go!

825
00:57:01.286 --> 00:57:02.786
- I want to go!
- What about your candy?

826
00:57:02.788 --> 00:57:06.324
I don't care about the candy!
I want to go!

827
00:57:17.737 --> 00:57:20.871
There's not much sense
in my going to church.

828
00:57:20.873 --> 00:57:22.773
God, this movie's boring.

829
00:57:22.775 --> 00:57:24.509
- Give me some colors.
- Are you serious?

830
00:57:24.511 --> 00:57:26.576
I knew we should've gone
in the goddamn maze, man.

831
00:57:26.578 --> 00:57:28.478
- Yeah. Fuck that.
- It would've been way more fun.

832
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.248
Me and the cool kids over here
are gonna go...

833
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.748
Man, you are
such a little bitch.

834
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:33.518
You guys want to go out
to the fucking maze?

835
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.320
- No, no... Really?
- Better than this shit show.

836
00:57:36.322 --> 00:57:37.721
You'll be all right.

837
00:57:37.723 --> 00:57:39.790
Yeah. No, no. No hard feelings.
That's fine.

838
00:57:39.792 --> 00:57:41.759
- See you later, man.
- We'll see you later, pumpkin.

839
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:44.661
Enjoy the fun
in this piece of shit.

840
00:57:44.663 --> 00:57:47.431
Stop it.
You're acting like a child!

841
00:57:47.433 --> 00:57:49.567
They're coming for you.

842
00:57:49.569 --> 00:57:51.802
Look!
There comes one of them now.

843
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:12.956
- Denver, Sheriff.
- Hey.

844
00:58:12.958 --> 00:58:15.960
Quite a posse you've got going,
but the first movie's started.

845
00:58:15.962 --> 00:58:17.661
You seen Reddick?

846
00:58:17.663 --> 00:58:21.232
Yeah. She went around back
to check the maze.

847
00:58:21.234 --> 00:58:22.532
Wan, Slater, take the street.

848
00:58:22.534 --> 00:58:23.867
Denver, let's check
the cemetery.

849
00:58:23.869 --> 00:58:26.739
- Something wrong?
- Just be careful.

850
00:58:28.373 --> 00:58:30.273
Okay.

851
00:58:30.275 --> 00:58:32.976
Get my shotgun is what <i>I'll</i> do.

852
00:58:32.978 --> 00:58:34.277
Just got to wait for...

853
00:58:34.279 --> 00:58:35.848
Greg, wait!

854
00:58:39.219 --> 00:58:41.552
What's wrong?
Did you hurt yourself?

855
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:51.295
Greg, it's the clown.

856
00:58:51.297 --> 00:58:52.697
Different clothes.

857
00:58:52.699 --> 00:58:54.431
Then it's a different clown.

858
00:58:54.433 --> 00:58:56.702
He has a knife.

859
00:58:58.471 --> 00:59:01.572
It's fake, Greg.
Look. He works here.

860
00:59:01.574 --> 00:59:03.443
You're wrong.

861
00:59:04.576 --> 00:59:07.378
Stay here.
I'll show you.

862
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.380
No!
Don't!

863
00:59:20.627 --> 00:59:22.962
You're scaring the boy.

864
00:59:26.866 --> 00:59:28.833
It's okay, Greg.

865
00:59:28.835 --> 00:59:30.904
He's gonna let us pass.

866
00:59:33.605 --> 00:59:35.605
Hey! Hey!

867
00:59:35.607 --> 00:59:36.873
Greg! Wait!

868
00:59:36.875 --> 00:59:39.777
There's nothing to be afraid of.

869
00:59:39.779 --> 00:59:41.679
Greg!

870
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.424
See? He's gone.

871
00:59:51.324 --> 00:59:52.626
Come on.

872
01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:10.340
Come on.
Come on.

873
01:00:10.342 --> 01:00:11.741
Oh, my God.

874
01:00:14.013 --> 01:00:15.915
There's Greg.

875
01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:18.782
It's Trick, Nicky.
We got to get out of here.

876
01:00:18.784 --> 01:00:20.851
You've been drinking
Greg's Kool-Aid?

877
01:00:21.888 --> 01:00:23.887
Fuck off!

878
01:00:23.889 --> 01:00:27.424
Oh, my nose.
Oh, I think she broke my nose.

879
01:00:31.596 --> 01:00:34.398
- No. Let's go back.
- This is the way out.

880
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.333
It's just around him.
We're almost there.

881
01:00:57.956 --> 01:00:58.924
Trick.

882
01:01:00.893 --> 01:01:02.625
Run! Run!

883
01:01:10.502 --> 01:01:12.402
What's that?

884
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.075
Oh, shit.

885
01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:26.916
It's Trick.

886
01:01:26.918 --> 01:01:28.786
Moviegoers at the church,
families in the maze.

887
01:01:28.788 --> 01:01:30.855
It's like a killing ground.
We got to warn them.

888
01:01:30.857 --> 01:01:33.123
Wan, Slater, we found Reddick's
body in the fire escape.

889
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.425
Call it in.
Denver, wait!

890
01:01:35.427 --> 01:01:37.161
I need bodies
to lock down the church

891
01:01:37.163 --> 01:01:40.367
and the crime scene
around Reddick... now!

892
01:02:21.873 --> 01:02:23.776
Wait up, guys!

893
01:02:31.451 --> 01:02:32.983
Get out of here!

894
01:02:32.985 --> 01:02:35.889
Tell everybody you see to go.
There's been a murder.

895
01:02:56.107 --> 01:02:57.808
Sheriff, it's me.

896
01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:00.143
Jesus, Slater.
Stay here.

897
01:03:00.145 --> 01:03:01.744
Alone?

898
01:03:01.746 --> 01:03:03.547
Keep it together, Slater.

899
01:03:09.522 --> 01:03:12.088
Sweetie, you got to run.

900
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:13.590
I can't carry you anymore!

901
01:03:13.592 --> 01:03:15.925
- No! I can't! I'm scared!
- It's okay.

902
01:03:15.927 --> 01:03:17.728
Greg, wait!

903
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:20.163
- Greg!
- It's Trick! He's here.

904
01:03:20.165 --> 01:03:21.965
Greg!

905
01:03:21.967 --> 01:03:23.833
Nicky!

906
01:03:23.835 --> 01:03:25.138
Get down!

907
01:03:40.219 --> 01:03:41.521
Human after all.

908
01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:44.457
Denver.

909
01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:47.190
Come on.

910
01:03:58.871 --> 01:04:00.137
Fuck me.

911
01:04:00.139 --> 01:04:02.873
- Shit!
- I could've killed you, Tal.

912
01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:05.009
That makes two of us, Sheriff.

913
01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:06.480
What the hell is going on?

914
01:04:07.013 --> 01:04:09.980
Look, we've got trouble.

915
01:04:09.982 --> 01:04:11.717
Deputy Reddick is dead.

916
01:04:12.752 --> 01:04:14.050
Iris?

917
01:04:14.052 --> 01:04:15.886
I need to lock down the church.

918
01:04:15.888 --> 01:04:19.223
Any one of your costumed
moviegoers could be her killer.

919
01:04:19.225 --> 01:04:21.862
Is it him... Trick Weaver?

920
01:04:22.594 --> 01:04:24.163
I think so, Tal.

921
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:28.935
Let's go find
that little sumbitch.

922
01:04:32.938 --> 01:04:34.804
Let's take a look at that arm.

923
01:04:50.723 --> 01:04:52.790
Could've been worse.
You got lucky.

924
01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:55.261
I don't <i>feel</i> lucky.

925
01:04:59.764 --> 01:05:01.297
- There we go!
- Troy!

926
01:05:01.299 --> 01:05:03.067
Troy!

927
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:04.134
Trick Weaver's back.

928
01:05:04.136 --> 01:05:06.036
Oh. Hey, Cheryl.
What?

929
01:05:06.038 --> 01:05:08.204
Trick Weaver is back.

930
01:05:08.206 --> 01:05:09.340
Trick?

931
01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:11.044
Troy, come on!

932
01:05:13.145 --> 01:05:14.911
Hey, yo!
Wait up!

933
01:05:14.913 --> 01:05:18.717
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

934
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:21.018
Come on.

935
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.252
Come on.
Okay.

936
01:05:27.058 --> 01:05:29.860
Deputies are on their way.
Shut down the movie.

937
01:05:29.862 --> 01:05:31.962
The last thing I want
is Trick taking a hostage,

938
01:05:31.964 --> 01:05:32.962
so go easy.

939
01:05:32.964 --> 01:05:34.831
I always go easy.

940
01:05:34.833 --> 01:05:36.268
No, you don't.

941
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.043
All right.
Come on, guys.

942
01:05:45.277 --> 01:05:47.011
Everybody hurry up.

943
01:05:49.081 --> 01:05:51.117
Everyone get in.

944
01:05:53.719 --> 01:05:55.956
- Get them to the hospital.
- Okay.

945
01:05:57.956 --> 01:05:59.790
Detective Den...

946
01:05:59.792 --> 01:06:02.161
Mike... kill him this time.

947
01:06:17.275 --> 01:06:18.976
Got your ass now, Trick.

948
01:06:18.978 --> 01:06:21.744
I'm coming for you,
you son of a bitch!

949
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:36.893
Everybody down!

950
01:06:38.697 --> 01:06:40.799
Well, if you're coming, come on.

951
01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:43.866
Get in.

952
01:06:51.076 --> 01:06:53.379
Sumbitch.

953
01:07:15.768 --> 01:07:17.670
Aah!

954
01:07:22.907 --> 01:07:24.440
What are you doing?
Go after him.

955
01:07:24.442 --> 01:07:26.245
Not without you.
Come on.

956
01:07:33.351 --> 01:07:34.420
Slater.

957
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.357
- Call it in.
- Sheriff, we saw him.

958
01:07:40.359 --> 01:07:42.125
He's headed back into the maze.

959
01:07:42.127 --> 01:07:43.927
Copy that.
We're on our way.

960
01:07:43.929 --> 01:07:46.063
Secure the church.
Check everyone.

961
01:07:46.065 --> 01:07:47.333
Let's go!

962
01:07:49.902 --> 01:07:51.869
Troy Meeks is in the maze.

963
01:07:51.871 --> 01:07:53.871
There's lots of people
still in the maze, Mike.

964
01:07:53.873 --> 01:07:56.440
But Troy's the only one
who stabbed him four years ago.

965
01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:58.108
You think he's here for Troy?

966
01:07:58.110 --> 01:07:59.509
He here's for anyone
who slighted him...

967
01:07:59.511 --> 01:08:02.346
you, me, Troy, Talbott...
and anyone we care about.

968
01:08:16.295 --> 01:08:19.062
...everyone leave the maze now.

969
01:08:19.064 --> 01:08:21.231
Hey, had a little too much,
pig boy?

970
01:08:21.233 --> 01:08:22.465
You up, man?

971
01:08:22.467 --> 01:08:24.334
Piggy went to the market.

972
01:08:24.336 --> 01:08:26.402
Yo.
Be ready, dudes.

973
01:08:26.404 --> 01:08:29.005
He's gonna jump up
at any moment, I'm telling you.

974
01:08:29.007 --> 01:08:31.307
Troy, you got to come with us.

975
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:32.344
Hey. Yo.

976
01:08:35.314 --> 01:08:37.880
Whoa. That... That was there.
We were just... We were just...

977
01:08:37.882 --> 01:08:39.516
He's dead.

978
01:08:39.518 --> 01:08:41.050
What?

979
01:08:41.052 --> 01:08:42.287
Trick Weaver's back.

980
01:08:44.089 --> 01:08:45.589
No.

981
01:08:45.591 --> 01:08:48.224
I mean, no way.
Trick's dead.

982
01:08:48.226 --> 01:08:49.459
He's not dead.
He's here.

983
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:50.861
And we think he's here for you.

984
01:08:50.863 --> 01:08:52.529
Me?
W-Why me?

985
01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:54.364
You stabbed him four years ago.

986
01:08:54.366 --> 01:08:56.202
But I...

987
01:08:58.304 --> 01:09:00.073
Trick doesn't think that,
does he?

988
01:09:00.872 --> 01:09:02.875
Why <i>wouldn't</i> he think that?

989
01:09:05.944 --> 01:09:08.281
'Cause, uh...

990
01:09:11.449 --> 01:09:15.087
'Cause I...
I didn't really do it.

991
01:09:16.889 --> 01:09:18.422
See, I-I mean,
I didn't even punch him.

992
01:09:18.424 --> 01:09:20.356
That was Dan and the other guys.
I was just...

993
01:09:20.358 --> 01:09:22.191
You stabbed him
with that fire poker.

994
01:09:22.193 --> 01:09:24.127
Troy, that's what you told us.

995
01:09:24.129 --> 01:09:26.396
Right, but...
s-she didn't remember doing it.

996
01:09:26.398 --> 01:09:28.965
She was in shock, see?

997
01:09:28.967 --> 01:09:31.300
I just figured
since she didn't remember...

998
01:09:31.302 --> 01:09:34.940
that maybe I should tell
everybody it was me.

999
01:09:36.474 --> 01:09:37.473
For her sake, I mean.

1000
01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:40.145
Who didn't remember?

1001
01:09:42.948 --> 01:09:44.647
Cheryl stabbed Trick
with that poker.

1002
01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:46.185
He saw her do it, too.

1003
01:09:47.118 --> 01:09:48.420
The hospital.

1004
01:09:49.688 --> 01:09:51.088
You don't think he really
wants to hurt <i>me,</i> do you?

1005
01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:52.321
Hey, what about me?!

1006
01:09:52.323 --> 01:09:54.159
Am I... Am I gonna live?!

1007
01:09:55.594 --> 01:09:57.194
Nicole Taylor?

1008
01:10:05.938 --> 01:10:08.071
Hey, I'm gonna go check
on my dad.

1009
01:10:08.073 --> 01:10:09.906
Of course.
We'll be here.

1010
01:10:09.908 --> 01:10:11.143
Okay.

1011
01:10:22.388 --> 01:10:24.489
I'll be back, kiddo.

1012
01:10:26.925 --> 01:10:29.294
Mom and Dad
will be here soon, okay?

1013
01:10:38.938 --> 01:10:41.440
I remember the day Mom left.

1014
01:10:43.509 --> 01:10:48.348
You asked me... if I thought
you were a good dad.

1015
01:10:59.591 --> 01:11:04.264
Well... I wish I could
tell you that, but...

1016
01:11:05.497 --> 01:11:07.563
I know things were bad
after Mom left,

1017
01:11:07.565 --> 01:11:11.371
but... she didn't just leave you.

1018
01:11:12.037 --> 01:11:14.140
She left me too.

1019
01:11:16.074 --> 01:11:18.741
Why are you doing this to me?

1020
01:11:18.743 --> 01:11:20.610
I need you, Daddy.

1021
01:11:20.612 --> 01:11:25.014
I-I'm alone, and... I don't know
what I would do without you.

1022
01:11:27.685 --> 01:11:29.656
I'm sorry.

1023
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:33.493
I'm sorry.

1024
01:11:34.158 --> 01:11:35.592
I wish...

1025
01:11:35.594 --> 01:11:40.033
I wish there was something
I can do.

1026
01:11:42.033 --> 01:11:45.270
But if... if you want to know...

1027
01:11:54.145 --> 01:11:57.317
...you've been the best dad
I could ever ask for.

1028
01:11:59.484 --> 01:12:01.117
I love you.

1029
01:12:25.344 --> 01:12:27.180
No. No. No.

1030
01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.580
No. No.

1031
01:12:30.582 --> 01:12:32.348
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1032
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:35.153
No, no, no, no, no.

1033
01:12:37.656 --> 01:12:39.722
No.

1034
01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:41.724
No.

1035
01:12:41.726 --> 01:12:43.727
Dad. Oh, Daddy.

1036
01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:49.034
I'm so sorry.

1037
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.120
The power's been cut!

1038
01:13:11.122 --> 01:13:12.489
- Emergency lights?
- They're out.

1039
01:13:12.491 --> 01:13:14.523
- What the hell?
- What happened?

1040
01:13:14.525 --> 01:13:16.459
I-I'm fine.

1041
01:13:16.461 --> 01:13:18.195
- I'll find Cheryl.
- She'll be with her dad.

1042
01:13:18.197 --> 01:13:20.196
Helen!

1043
01:13:20.198 --> 01:13:21.231
Help me.

1044
01:13:21.233 --> 01:13:22.499
Lock down the E.R.

1045
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:24.700
- I'll come with you.
- Wait here.

1046
01:13:24.702 --> 01:13:28.205
Mitch, we need a
perimeter around the E.R., now!

1047
01:13:28.207 --> 01:13:30.673
All right, Sheriff.
Let's get you stitched...

1048
01:13:30.675 --> 01:13:32.511
Sheriff?

1049
01:13:33.244 --> 01:13:34.546
Nurse?
Code red!

1050
01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.147
What if we're too late?

1051
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:38.781
Slater, keep it together.

1052
01:13:38.783 --> 01:13:40.717
How?
How am I supposed to do that?

1053
01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:42.252
He's always a step ahead of us.

1054
01:13:42.254 --> 01:13:44.454
It's not normal.
It's not human.

1055
01:13:57.903 --> 01:14:01.370
Hey. You're injured.
You should be in the E.R.

1056
01:14:01.372 --> 01:14:05.811
Cheryl, you, me...
That's what he wants.

1057
01:14:07.211 --> 01:14:09.549
That's why he's doing this.

1058
01:14:10.582 --> 01:14:13.782
Do us all a favor.
Don't make it easy for him.

1059
01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:15.252
Hold still, Sheriff.

1060
01:14:15.254 --> 01:14:17.654
- Go with him.
- You're bleeding out.

1061
01:14:17.656 --> 01:14:19.623
- I'll get the doctor.
- No. Go with Denver.

1062
01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:21.191
I'm sorry, Sheriff.

1063
01:14:21.193 --> 01:14:24.130
But I'd rather save you
than die with him.

1064
01:14:44.882 --> 01:14:46.885
Fuck, this kid likes pumpkins.

1065
01:15:30.429 --> 01:15:32.364
Wait. Wait.
Shh.

1066
01:15:38.769 --> 01:15:41.640
The little shit's
been at this for a while.

1067
01:15:46.744 --> 01:15:48.544
Hey.

1068
01:15:50.881 --> 01:15:52.915
Trick, don't.

1069
01:17:01.752 --> 01:17:03.053
What's he doing?

1070
01:17:03.055 --> 01:17:05.621
This is his moment.

1071
01:17:05.623 --> 01:17:08.493
We shot him.
Cheryl stabbed him.

1072
01:17:10.028 --> 01:17:11.797
Stabbed him?

1073
01:17:22.808 --> 01:17:24.644
Trick!

1074
01:17:36.854 --> 01:17:38.690
It was me.

1075
01:17:41.926 --> 01:17:43.461
Now what?

1076
01:17:47.698 --> 01:17:49.598
Spin the knife.

1077
01:17:58.809 --> 01:18:00.610
I shot you.

1078
01:18:00.612 --> 01:18:01.910
Okay?

1079
01:18:01.912 --> 01:18:03.980
Tonight, back then.

1080
01:18:03.982 --> 01:18:06.115
It was me, you dickhead.

1081
01:18:06.117 --> 01:18:09.852
There's no need to spin.
Keep them out of this.

1082
01:18:09.854 --> 01:18:12.722
I'm the one who's been
dogging you all these years.

1083
01:18:12.724 --> 01:18:15.892
I'm the one who's gonna keep
dogging you till it's done.

1084
01:18:15.894 --> 01:18:18.660
Choose me, you get to keep
stalking Halloween

1085
01:18:18.662 --> 01:18:21.900
for all of time,
like the demon you want to be.

1086
01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:26.739
Shit.

1087
01:18:35.447 --> 01:18:36.582
Thing is...

1088
01:18:38.516 --> 01:18:40.150
You?

1089
01:18:41.819 --> 01:18:45.757
You're not some supernatural
evil.

1090
01:18:47.893 --> 01:18:49.662
You're just a narcissistic...

1091
01:19:16.921 --> 01:19:18.623
Aah!

1092
01:19:23.461 --> 01:19:24.897
Trick!

1093
01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:44.149
No!

1094
01:19:58.796 --> 01:20:02.167
Denver... he's still alive.

1095
01:20:06.571 --> 01:20:08.170
I'm so cold.

1096
01:20:08.172 --> 01:20:12.444
Smooth Jonny in the house!

1097
01:20:27.559 --> 01:20:28.894
Got you.

1098
01:21:00.791 --> 01:21:02.691
Mike!

1099
01:21:02.693 --> 01:21:04.893
My God, Mike.

1100
01:21:04.895 --> 01:21:06.562
Oh, God.

1101
01:21:06.564 --> 01:21:09.100
Don't turn your back on them.

1102
01:21:11.269 --> 01:21:13.506
What the...
Who are you?

1103
01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.209
Stay back, both of you.

1104
01:21:20.144 --> 01:21:22.678
Stay back.
Stay back.

1105
01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.013
Slater, watch yourself!

1106
01:21:24.015 --> 01:21:25.751
Got your back. Check on Denver.

1107
01:21:27.284 --> 01:21:29.619
Oh, God.
Look at me.

1108
01:21:29.621 --> 01:21:31.120
All right.

1109
01:21:31.122 --> 01:21:33.722
Okay. All right. All right.

1110
01:21:33.724 --> 01:21:34.926
Slater, get a doctor!

1111
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.730
Hey, Wan? Buddy.

1112
01:22:02.754 --> 01:22:06.257
I used to work at
a cop bar, and that is cop porn.

1113
01:22:08.292 --> 01:22:09.291
You.

1114
01:22:09.293 --> 01:22:11.160
Hey, pumpkin.

1115
01:22:11.162 --> 01:22:13.065
Next round's on me.

1116
01:22:18.636 --> 01:22:20.169
Hey.
Did you see him? Where'd he go?

1117
01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:23.042
Of course I saw him, shithead.
That's why I swerved.

1118
01:22:25.743 --> 01:22:28.076
I shot you in the maze.

1119
01:23:14.925 --> 01:23:17.125
You were all Trick?

1120
01:23:19.797 --> 01:23:24.133
People want a monster
that they can fear and hate,

1121
01:23:24.135 --> 01:23:26.235
something evil that makes sense

1122
01:23:26.237 --> 01:23:29.739
out of the random horrors
of their lives.

1123
01:23:29.741 --> 01:23:31.740
That's our trick.

1124
01:23:31.742 --> 01:23:34.043
That's what we give to you.

1125
01:23:34.045 --> 01:23:36.882
That's what we'll keep giving
to everyone.

1126
01:23:38.483 --> 01:23:43.186
Consider it a... public service.

1127
01:23:45.924 --> 01:23:49.459
You believed we were the devil.

1128
01:23:49.461 --> 01:23:53.062
Most grounded cop
on the planet.

1129
01:23:53.064 --> 01:23:56.965
If you can believe, anyone can.

1130
01:24:03.942 --> 01:24:06.342
Man, you just don't get it.

1131
01:24:06.344 --> 01:24:07.680
You're dying.

1132
01:24:10.215 --> 01:24:12.016
And when you're dead,
you're dead.

1133
01:24:14.985 --> 01:24:16.921
But after tonight...

1134
01:24:17.488 --> 01:24:18.991
...we'll grow.

1135
01:24:19.823 --> 01:24:21.891
And we'll grow more next year

1136
01:24:21.893 --> 01:24:25.730
and the year after that...
and the year after that.

1137
01:24:32.269 --> 01:24:36.474
All the sheep want to believe
the lie.

1138
01:24:38.342 --> 01:24:40.045
They need it.

1139
01:24:44.983 --> 01:24:46.982
'Cause the truth is...

1140
01:24:46.984 --> 01:24:49.854
no one needs a reason
to be evil.

1141
01:25:10.507 --> 01:25:13.412
We do this because we can.

1142
01:25:14.412 --> 01:25:15.848
Because we're good at it.

1143
01:25:16.982 --> 01:25:23.889
Now, I'd love to stay
and watch you die, but, uh...

1144
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:27.493
...I really need to go find
Cheryl.

1145
01:25:33.264 --> 01:25:35.900
Aah!

1146
01:25:38.603 --> 01:25:39.968
Denver!

1147
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:43.074
Denver!

1148
01:25:43.507 --> 01:25:44.606
W-Where is he?

1149
01:25:48.912 --> 01:25:50.079
Denver!

1150
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:52.147
Hey.
Denver.

1151
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:54.249
Get help!

1152
01:25:56.888 --> 01:25:58.087
Denver?

1153
01:25:58.089 --> 01:25:59.355
Denver?

1154
01:25:59.357 --> 01:26:01.223
Where did he go?

1155
01:26:01.225 --> 01:26:02.991
Where did he go?

1156
01:26:02.993 --> 01:26:05.428
No, no, no.

1157
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:07.566
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

1158
01:26:08.466 --> 01:26:09.865
Denver!

1159
01:26:09.867 --> 01:26:11.102
Stay with me!
Stay with me!

1160
01:26:12.336 --> 01:26:14.570
If you die, he wins.

1161
01:26:14.572 --> 01:26:16.475
You want that?

1162
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:21.477
God!

1163
01:26:21.479 --> 01:26:22.578
Where did he go?

1164
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.914
Get a stretcher out here now!

1165
01:26:24.916 --> 01:26:27.316
Did you see him?
Where did he go?

1166
01:26:29.019 --> 01:26:33.054
There was... There was blood,
but... but no body.

1167
01:26:33.056 --> 01:26:35.223
He... He just disappeared.

1168
01:26:35.225 --> 01:26:38.194
He... He was gone,
just... just like before.

1169
01:26:38.196 --> 01:26:41.500
Like... some sort
of Halloween nightmare.

1170
01:26:56.613 --> 01:26:59.550
I'm so sorry.

1171
01:27:00.184 --> 01:27:02.221
I'm so sorry.

1172
01:28:13.323 --> 01:28:15.290
I just need to find my walkie.
I don't even need to...

1173
01:28:15.292 --> 01:28:17.159
Listen, if you don't calm down,

1174
01:28:17.161 --> 01:28:18.694
I'm gonna have my
anesthesiologist come in here

1175
01:28:18.696 --> 01:28:20.396
and knock your ass out.

1176
01:28:20.398 --> 01:28:23.168
Slater, over here.

1177
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.166
Where's... Where's Wan?

1178
01:28:25.168 --> 01:28:26.434
Sheriff, I'm so sorry.

1179
01:28:26.436 --> 01:28:28.105
Wan's dead.

1180
01:28:29.006 --> 01:28:30.541
We were attacked.

1181
01:28:31.341 --> 01:28:32.575
And Denver?

1182
01:28:32.577 --> 01:28:34.709
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest.

1183
01:28:34.711 --> 01:28:36.379
He's not gonna make it.

1184
01:28:41.752 --> 01:28:43.419
What about Trick?

1185
01:28:43.421 --> 01:28:45.190
He's gone.

1186
01:29:59.229 --> 01:30:00.564
You.

1187
01:30:01.466 --> 01:30:02.768
<i>You</i> killed them.

1188
01:30:04.234 --> 01:30:07.703
You... You hurt me.

1189
01:31:04.862 --> 01:31:07.795
I guess your back
really is broken.

1190
01:31:07.797 --> 01:31:10.434
I hope that hurt, you fuck.

1191
01:31:11.668 --> 01:31:17.505
You and all the others like you
killed my dad,

1192
01:31:17.507 --> 01:31:18.844
killed Denver...

1193
01:31:30.921 --> 01:31:34.326
Fuck you...
and fuck your friends.

1194
01:31:35.725 --> 01:31:37.860
I stopped you last time, too.

1195
01:31:37.862 --> 01:31:40.295
I know your secret.

1196
01:31:40.297 --> 01:31:41.632
You're nothing.

1197
01:31:44.301 --> 01:31:46.871
And this time, you're really...

1198
01:31:48.839 --> 01:31:50.175
...dead.

1199
01:32:00.885 --> 01:32:03.388
One...

1200
01:32:04.988 --> 01:32:06.757
...of...

1201
01:32:07.958 --> 01:32:09.594
...us.

1202
01:32:41.458 --> 01:32:43.561
Here's another one.

1203
01:32:47.998 --> 01:32:50.202
What do you mean, another one?

1204
01:32:51.969 --> 01:32:54.839
Trick is a "they," not a "he."

1205
01:33:10.587 --> 01:33:12.021
And you're one of them, Slater.

1206
01:33:12.023 --> 01:33:13.625
What?

1207
01:33:14.824 --> 01:33:16.724
What do you mean, "one of them"?

1208
01:33:16.726 --> 01:33:18.863
You know me.
Sheriff, I'm not...

1209
01:34:06.777 --> 01:34:08.343
And here's the latest

1210
01:34:08.345 --> 01:34:10.913
on that strange murder spree
in Benton.

1211
01:34:10.915 --> 01:34:13.382
Police say at least three
different individuals

1212
01:34:13.384 --> 01:34:15.616
posed as one single killer.

1213
01:34:15.618 --> 01:34:16.884
But get this.

1214
01:34:19.989 --> 01:34:22.027
And this beat goes on.

1215
01:34:22.859 --> 01:34:25.526
And on and on.

1216
01:34:25.528 --> 01:34:27.396
- Two of us won't do.
- I know.

1217
01:34:27.398 --> 01:34:29.498
Our numbers need to grow
and grow and grow.

1218
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.670
- Unstoppable.
- Up there.

1219
01:35:09.607 --> 01:35:11.376
Let's go.

1220
01:35:19.849 --> 01:35:22.651
So we move south.

1221
01:35:22.653 --> 01:35:24.085
- All right.
- This way?

1222
01:35:24.087 --> 01:35:25.587
Yeah.

1223
01:35:25.589 --> 01:35:26.991
- Good.
- Sounds good.

1224
01:35:29.559 --> 01:35:33.462
I'm gonna say this every day,
because every day,

1225
01:35:33.464 --> 01:35:34.929
I want you to know
you have a choice...

1226
01:35:34.931 --> 01:35:38.032
And every day,
I'll give you the same answer.

1227
01:35:38.034 --> 01:35:40.468
I'm coming with you.

1228
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:41.870
Three Tricks are dead.

1229
01:35:41.872 --> 01:35:46.778
But he... they...
want it to look supernatural.

1230
01:35:47.644 --> 01:35:50.579
They found like minds to join
their little cult before.

1231
01:35:50.581 --> 01:35:52.947
And they'll find new recruits.

1232
01:35:52.949 --> 01:35:54.853
Probably already have.

1233
01:35:55.685 --> 01:35:57.619
But we find them.

1234
01:35:57.621 --> 01:35:58.853
