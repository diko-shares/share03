1
00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:22.725
Yes.

2
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.051
Yes.

3
00:02:22.697 --> 00:02:24.657
Yes.

4
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.720
Please. Please.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

5
00:02:47.803 --> 00:02:50.598
It's utter chaos around here.

6
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.308
And I'm terrified that
we're running out of time.

7
00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:55.310
Am I trying to be
too perfect?

8
00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:57.646
- Oh, but I want it to be so exquisite.
- So do we.

9
00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:02.233
- But we're trying to be too exquisite.
- Why not aim for the stars?

10
00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:04.235
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

11
00:03:04.277 --> 00:03:07.655
- We do need some answers on the flowers.
- Ah, yes, freesia, freesia.

12
00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:10.741
Everywhere freesia.
Daddy loves freesia.

13
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:13.911
Good morning. Good morning.
Oh. Hello. Hi.

14
00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:15.954
- Lights?
- "Lights."

15
00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:20.041
Not too bright
and not too dark.

16
00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:23.002
I'm looking for
a saffron glow,

17
00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:25.338
sort of tea-dance '20s.

18
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.590
If food is the prose
of a party,

19
00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:30.885
then lights
are its poetry.

20
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.474
It works. If food is the prose of
a party, lights are its poetry.

21
00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:41.936
I like that. If music were the food of
love, play on. I'm going out of my mind.

22
00:03:41.978 --> 00:03:43.938
Good morning,
Mr. Parrish.

23
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.691
- What do you think of all this, Helen?
- It's gonna be beautiful.

24
00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:49.193
And Allison says
the president may come.

25
00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:51.446
The president's got better things to do
than come to my birthday party.

26
00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:52.747
Like what?

27
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.199
- Daddy? Do you have a minute?
- Good morning, Allison.

28
00:03:55.282 --> 00:03:57.451
Not much more.
Big day in the big city.

29
00:03:57.534 --> 00:03:59.995
- What's on your mind?
- Fireworks. Update:

30
00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:02.872
We are constructing
the number 65 on the barge.

31
00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:06.834
Archers from the State College of New
Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it.

32
00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:11.338
When it catches fire, it will give
us the effect of a Viking funeral,

33
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.340
but with none
of the morbidity.

34
00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:16.468
The Hudson River Authority says that for
you, they'll make a special dispensation.

35
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:19.387
But, of course, there will be
an overtime bill...

36
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:21.389
for the Poughkeepsie
Fire Department.

37
00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:24.851
So, what do you think?

38
00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:27.311
Good?
No good?

39
00:04:27.395 --> 00:04:30.564
Allison, I trust you.
This is your thing.

40
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:34.554
But it's your birthday. I hate
arrows. They make me nervous.

41
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.303
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning, honey.

42
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:38.429
Morning.

43
00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:40.367
Morning.
You're "Honey," I'm "Allison."

44
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:42.255
Oh.

45
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:46.994
Oh, Dad, Drew called from the helicopter,
and they're still two minutes away.

46
00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:49.415
- Drew's aboard?
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:51.500
He wanted to ride
back down with you.

48
00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:55.712
So why don't you sit down, relax, and get
some food in that flat tummy of yours.

49
00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.714
- Are you coming?
- No.

50
00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:01.009
You've got patients to attend to.
I've got three hysterical chefs,

51
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.136
one of whom loves truffles,
the other one hates truffles,

52
00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.596
and the third one doesn't
even know what truffles are.

53
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.391
- I hate parties.
- But, Daddy, calm down.

54
00:05:08.432 --> 00:05:10.684
You're gonna love it.
I swear.

55
00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:14.021
Isn't it enough to be on the Earth for 65
years without having to be reminded of it?

56
00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:15.597
No.

57
00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:22.695
Will you relax?
I know it's a big deal day.

58
00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.115
- How'd you know that?
- Drew told me.

59
00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:28.117
Does he tell you everything?

60
00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.744
I hope so.

61
00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:33.122
You like him, don't you?

62
00:05:33.205 --> 00:05:35.958
Yep, I guess so.

63
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.585
- I don't want to interfere, but, uh...
- Then don't.

64
00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:43.590
Well, here comes our boy now.

65
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:45.591
Shall we?

66
00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:49.303
- Okay.
- Hello, beautiful.

67
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:52.431
Hi.

68
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.521
Good morning, Drew.
Thanks for coming up.

69
00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:03.316
Well, big day. Wanted to line up
a few ducks before kickoff.

70
00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.235
Any thoughts, last minute
refinements, variations, anything?

71
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.531
Thoughts, no.
I did hear a voice last night.

72
00:06:10.614 --> 00:06:12.700
- A voice?
- In my sleep.

73
00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:15.244
- What'd it say?
- "Yes."

74
00:06:15.327 --> 00:06:19.080
- Yes to the deal?
- Maybe. Who knows?

75
00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:21.082
You know how voices are.

76
00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:24.419
Hmm?
I thank you, Delia.

77
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.712
Okay, let's go.
Delia, your pen.

78
00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:30.091
- Hi, Bill. How you doin'?
- Morning, Quince.

79
00:06:30.174 --> 00:06:32.760
- I'm doin' great, and you?
- Oh, I'm great.

80
00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:35.387
- This is it, "B-day."
- Huh? Sorry.

81
00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:39.266
Bontecou day.
We're gonna close... with Big John.

82
00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.309
Look at you, Bill.
You're all cool as a cat.

83
00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:44.687
Over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's
just shittin' in his pants.

84
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:48.524
Remember, everybody,
big meeting tonight at Daddy's.

85
00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:52.278
Dinner. You, too, Drew.
We have lots of loose ends.

86
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.906
- Not my birthday again?
- You're only 65 once, Dad.

87
00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:57.949
Thank God.
Now let's get the day started.

88
00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:00.577
Remember, dinner in the city
at Daddy's!

89
00:07:12.963 --> 00:07:16.174
Mm-hmm.
It's so ridiculous.

90
00:07:16.258 --> 00:07:18.260
Do you love Drew?

91
00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:21.638
No, don't do anything.
Just stay exactly where...

92
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:24.518
Do you love Drew?

93
00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:27.319
He's not gonna get a better offer than that.

94
00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:32.606
- You mean, like you loved Mom?
- Forget about me and Mom.

95
00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:39.237
- Are you gonna marry him?
- Oh, come on.

96
00:07:40.322 --> 00:07:42.240
I'm probably.

97
00:07:42.323 --> 00:07:45.159
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy.
He's smart. He's aggressive.

98
00:07:45.243 --> 00:07:50.247
He could carry Parrish Communications
into the 21st century and me along with it.

99
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:53.250
Mm-hmm.
So, what's wrong with that?

100
00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:55.711
That's for me.
I'm talking about you.

101
00:07:57.254 --> 00:08:00.215
It's not what you say about
Drew. It's what you don't say.

102
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:03.176
Maybe you're not listening.

103
00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:05.219
Oh, yes, I am.

104
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.263
Give him whatever he wants.

105
00:08:07.346 --> 00:08:12.184
There's not an ounce of excitement,
not a... whisper of a thrill.

106
00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:16.104
And this relationship has all the
passion of a pair of titmice.

107
00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:18.565
I want you to get
swept away out there.

108
00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:21.484
I want you to levitate.
I want you to...

109
00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:23.945
sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish.

110
00:08:24.028 --> 00:08:26.781
- Oh, that's all.
- Yeah. Be deliriously happy,

111
00:08:26.864 --> 00:08:29.241
or at least
leave yourself open to be.

112
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.198
Okay.

113
00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:35.581
"Be deliriously happy."
I shall, uh...

114
00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:37.874
I shall do my utmost.

115
00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:44.088
I know it's a cornball thing.

116
00:08:45.173 --> 00:08:47.800
But love is passion,

117
00:08:47.884 --> 00:08:49.802
obsession,

118
00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:52.596
someone
you can't live without.

119
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.474
I say, fall head over heels.

120
00:08:55.557 --> 00:09:00.270
Find someone you can love like crazy and
who will love you the same way back.

121
00:09:00.353 --> 00:09:05.274
How do you find him? Well, you forget
your head, and you listen to your heart.

122
00:09:05.358 --> 00:09:07.276
And I'm not hearing any heart.

123
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.239
'Cause the truth is, honey, there's no
sense living your life without this.

124
00:09:12.281 --> 00:09:16.576
To make the journey
and not fall deeply in love,

125
00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:19.746
well, you haven't lived
a life at all.

126
00:09:21.456 --> 00:09:26.085
But you have to try, 'cause if you
haven't tried, you haven't lived.

127
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.797
Bravo!

128
00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:31.799
Oh, you're tough.

129
00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:37.387
I'm sorry. Okay.

130
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:40.640
Give it to me again,
but the short version this time.

131
00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:43.476
Okay. Stay open.

132
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.813
Who knows?
Lightning could strike.

133
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:52.484
Yeah?

134
00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:54.486
Yeah.

135
00:10:03.578 --> 00:10:06.831
What do you think?
Is it just the executive committee,

136
00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:08.916
or are you guys gonna use me?

137
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.044
Quince, man, thanks for the offer,
but it's all set for just me and Bill.

138
00:10:12.127 --> 00:10:16.923
More people might...
I know. I know, gum up the works.

139
00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:19.593
"I want you to get swept away."

140
00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:20.545
Huh?

141
00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:22.428
I was just sayin' to Quince
that we won't need him until...

142
00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:24.389
- Did you hear something?
- Yeah, but I was just sayin' to Quince...

143
00:10:24.472 --> 00:10:26.891
- No, no, no. Not you.
- What's the matter, Daddy?

144
00:10:30.603 --> 00:10:33.188
Nothing. I'm sorry.
"I want you to levitate.

145
00:10:33.272 --> 00:10:36.733
I want you to sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish."

146
00:10:37.984 --> 00:10:41.154
- "Dance like a dervish"?
- Daddy, what is it?

147
00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:45.700
Nothing, I'm just talking
to myself. You know me.

148
00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:48.244
No, I've never known you
to talk to yourself.

149
00:10:48.286 --> 00:10:51.455
Oh, well, can I give you a lift?

150
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:54.525
No, I'm gonna catch a cab.
Listen, are you okay?

151
00:10:54.526 --> 00:10:55.226
Yeah.

152
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.253
Got my garters on, my ears
pricked... ready for action.

153
00:10:58.295 --> 00:11:00.297
Okay. Well...
Go get 'em, Pops.

154
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.799
You're damn right.
Okay.

155
00:11:06.094 --> 00:11:09.597
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

156
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.640
Oh, haven't heard
that one before.

157
00:11:11.682 --> 00:11:14.476
I'm sorry. I had to say it.

158
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.521
- Honey? Honey?
- Hi, George.

159
00:11:17.604 --> 00:11:21.358
Honey, you have to go on.

160
00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:23.651
Okay? There's a time to sow
and a time to reap.

161
00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:25.987
You have to sow.

162
00:11:26.028 --> 00:11:28.447
Sorry. Excuse me.

163
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:30.449
No, I liked him.
I don't like him anymore.

164
00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:32.785
'Cause you're my honey.

165
00:11:32.868 --> 00:11:34.828
Someone messes with you,
they mess with me.

166
00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:38.373
That's it. I'm on a plane in a
heartbeat. You let me know.

167
00:11:38.415 --> 00:11:42.502
Yep, when I get my phone in,
you're my first call. I promise.

168
00:11:42.544 --> 00:11:45.630
Hit the books, get the degree. One day
we'll be hanging out a shingle together.

169
00:11:45.713 --> 00:11:47.840
How's that?
Mmm? Okay.

170
00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:51.093
You all right?
Yes.

171
00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:53.762
You bet. Be strong.

172
00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:56.014
I love you. Bye-bye.

173
00:12:12.154 --> 00:12:14.656
- Morning.
- Good morning.

174
00:12:19.077 --> 00:12:21.037
I was talkin' kind of loud there.
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:24.040
Oh, not at all.

176
00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:27.335
It was fascinating.

177
00:12:28.753 --> 00:12:30.713
Yeah, what was fascinating
about it?

178
00:12:30.754 --> 00:12:33.632
Um...
You and, uh, "honey"?

179
00:12:37.469 --> 00:12:39.554
- It's my kid sister.
- Oh.

180
00:12:41.056 --> 00:12:42.974
And she just broke up with her
boyfriend and was thinking...

181
00:12:43.057 --> 00:12:45.309
about dropping out
of law school.

182
00:12:45.393 --> 00:12:48.980
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, nothing to be sorry about.

183
00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:51.300
That's the way it is with
men and women, isn't it?

184
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:53.201
What's the way?

185
00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:55.235
Nothing lasts.

186
00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:57.446
Oh. Yeah, I agree.

187
00:12:57.487 --> 00:12:59.656
Really? Why?

188
00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:04.410
No, I'm interested.

189
00:13:06.287 --> 00:13:08.205
I was just trying
to be agreeable.

190
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.877
Okay. All right.
I was sharpshooting.

191
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.422
- Oh.
- No, just that "nothing lasts" stuff.

192
00:13:17.506 --> 00:13:19.841
That was the problem with Honey's guy.
He didn't know what he wanted.

193
00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:23.052
So, he's fooling around,
and she catches him at it.

194
00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.179
You know, like one girlfriend
isn't enough for him.

195
00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.768
- So, you're a one-girl guy.
- Yes, I am.

196
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:34.354
- That's right.
- Right.

197
00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:37.691
Looking for her
right now, actually.

198
00:13:37.774 --> 00:13:40.777
Mmm. Who knows?
You might be her.

199
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.112
No, don't laugh.
I just got into town.

200
00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:45.323
I got the new job.

201
00:13:45.406 --> 00:13:47.658
I'm trying to get
into this apartment.

202
00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:53.831
Anyway,
so you're a doctor.

203
00:13:53.872 --> 00:13:55.832
Mmm.
How'd you know?

204
00:13:55.874 --> 00:13:58.418
'Cause everyone's
a doctor around here.

205
00:13:58.502 --> 00:14:03.590
This apartment building... Everyone's
in green slippers, the green pajamas.

206
00:14:03.673 --> 00:14:05.591
The guy I'm waiting for
to vacate...

207
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:07.933
- doctor.
- He's a doctor.

208
00:14:08.003 --> 00:14:09.716
What kind of doctor?

209
00:14:10.237 --> 00:14:13.015
Um, I'm a resident...
internal medicine.

210
00:14:14.475 --> 00:14:16.393
So, if I needed a doctor,
you could be it.

211
00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:18.728
I could be her. Yeah.

212
00:14:18.812 --> 00:14:20.814
You could be... her.

213
00:14:20.897 --> 00:14:22.816
Uh-huh.

214
00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:25.377
Yeah, I could.

215
00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:32.652
- I'm... I'm working at the hospital, so...
- I see.

216
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.405
This is my lucky day.
I just get in the big, bad city,

217
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.298
not only do I find a doctor,
but a beautiful woman, as well.

218
00:14:44.429 --> 00:14:45.545
Do you mind me saying that?

219
00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:48.005
Oh... No, of course.
No, it's fine.

220
00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:50.042
It's fine.
It's just...

221
00:14:51.104 --> 00:14:52.893
Listen, could I
buy you a cup of coffee?

222
00:14:54.864 --> 00:14:58.128
Um, I have some patients coming in,
so I should probably...

223
00:14:58.153 --> 00:14:59.450
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...get goin'.

224
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:01.259
I gotta get to the apartment
and get off to work.

225
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.960
Yeah.

226
00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:03.778
But I'd still like to have
another cup of coffee.

227
00:15:05.395 --> 00:15:07.731
- Um...
- Would you let me do that?

228
00:15:07.993 --> 00:15:10.671
Well, yeah, okay.

229
00:15:11.576 --> 00:15:12.552
Deal.

230
00:15:39.177 --> 00:15:41.513
- Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
- Morning, Jennifer.

231
00:15:41.554 --> 00:15:43.514
So, board convenes tomorrow.

232
00:15:43.556 --> 00:15:45.725
You'll recommend we close,
and it's a deal, right?

233
00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:49.937
As close as a deal could be.

234
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.939
Olympic.

235
00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:15.985
Yes.

236
00:16:28.272 --> 00:16:30.233
Yes.

237
00:16:32.935 --> 00:16:36.271
- "Yes" what?
- Yes is the answer to your question.

238
00:16:36.313 --> 00:16:38.273
Ah.

239
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.319
I didn't ask any question.

240
00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:45.321
I believe you did.

241
00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:49.658
Who are you?

242
00:16:51.727 --> 00:16:55.122
- Goddamn it. What's going on here?
- I think you know.

243
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.958
- I don't.
- Try.

244
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:03.383
"'Cause if you haven't tried,
you haven't lived."

245
00:17:07.357 --> 00:17:09.176
What are you talking about?

246
00:17:09.218 --> 00:17:11.178
What you were talking about.

247
00:17:14.476 --> 00:17:15.891
Who is this guy?

248
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:21.312
- Tell me who you are.
- Are you giving me orders?

249
00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:25.024
- No. I'm sorry, I...
- No, you're not.

250
00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:27.652
You're trying
to handle the situation.

251
00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:33.157
But this is the one situation
you knew you never could handle.

252
00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:41.581
It's enough...

253
00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:45.376
now.

254
00:17:58.638 --> 00:18:00.598
Huh?

255
00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:06.813
Talk to me, please.

256
00:18:07.939 --> 00:18:10.608
There's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

257
00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:14.111
What do you mean?

258
00:18:16.613 --> 00:18:19.824
I think you know, Bill.

259
00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.376
It's kind of a pro Bono job.

260
00:18:30.459 --> 00:18:32.419
- "Pro Bono"?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:32.503 --> 00:18:34.755
- Meaning, doing good?
- That's me.

262
00:18:34.838 --> 00:18:36.798
Gonna be doing good
all your life?

263
00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:42.721
I know what you're saying.
It doesn't pay so well, but, I like it.

264
00:18:42.722 --> 00:18:43.422
Mm-hmm.

265
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.349
Eventually it'll depend
on the woman I marry, I think.

266
00:18:47.583 --> 00:18:51.687
Maybe she'll want lots of kids,
a bigger house, better car, uh...

267
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.314
College doesn't come cheap.
You know? I don't know.

268
00:18:55.899 --> 00:18:59.611
Wow. Give up what you want
for the woman you marry.

269
00:18:59.653 --> 00:19:01.613
Hmm.

270
00:19:02.439 --> 00:19:03.990
Yeah, you know what?
I would.

271
00:19:04.032 --> 00:19:05.992
- Yeah?
- Gladly.

272
00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:10.329
'Cause you make your choices,
you know?

273
00:19:10.371 --> 00:19:13.999
Say, you and I, if we were married,
I would... No, for an example, okay?

274
00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:16.543
If you and I were married, I would
want to give you what you need.

275
00:19:16.627 --> 00:19:19.838
That's all. I'm talking about taking
care of each other the best you can.

276
00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:22.715
What's wrong with taking care of a
woman? She takes care of you.

277
00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:25.843
You'll have a hard time finding
a woman like that these days.

278
00:19:25.927 --> 00:19:28.888
- Shoot, you think so?
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.225
I don't know.
Lightning could strike.

280
00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:45.111
I've gotta go.

281
00:19:45.194 --> 00:19:48.606
- Yeah. Listen, did I say something wrong?
- No.

282
00:19:48.607 --> 00:19:51.825
- No? Sure?
- No. No. It was...

283
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:54.745
It was so right, it scares me.
That's all.

284
00:19:54.828 --> 00:19:56.788
Just...

285
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:02.085
You know, I was thinking,
I don't want you to be my doctor.

286
00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:06.005
I don't want you to...
examine me and...

287
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.382
Why?

288
00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:11.969
Because I like you
so much.

289
00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:25.231
And I... I don't want
to examine you.

290
00:20:25.314 --> 00:20:28.859
You don't? Why not?

291
00:20:28.943 --> 00:20:32.529
Because I like you so much.

292
00:20:35.282 --> 00:20:37.993
Oh, boy. Okay.

293
00:20:38.076 --> 00:20:41.079
Now I gotta go, so...

294
00:20:41.162 --> 00:20:43.998
- Yep, understood.
- All right. All right.

295
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.417
Fair enough. See ya.

296
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:48.961
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

297
00:22:29.136 --> 00:22:31.430
Music.

298
00:22:31.472 --> 00:22:35.058
I know how you love music, Daddy.
And I want to have music that pleases you,

299
00:22:35.142 --> 00:22:38.728
but doesn't put a thousand
other people to sleep.

300
00:22:38.812 --> 00:22:42.774
I've agonized over it and finally
settled on Sidney Brown.

301
00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:43.475
Good.

302
00:22:43.476 --> 00:22:47.111
- Twenty-four men... very eclectic.
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:22:47.153 --> 00:22:51.282
Plus, I'm feathering in
a Latin sextet on their breaks.

304
00:22:54.493 --> 00:22:57.371
You haven't heard
a word I've said, have you?

305
00:22:59.789 --> 00:23:02.333
- What, honey? Sorry.
- Daddy.

306
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.328
Yes.

307
00:23:05.628 --> 00:23:07.547
Daddy?

308
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.424
Mr. Parrish?

309
00:23:10.508 --> 00:23:13.510
- Yes?
- Dinner's served.

310
00:23:15.262 --> 00:23:19.182
- Yeah.
- Never mind.

311
00:23:19.266 --> 00:23:21.184
Leave it to me.

312
00:23:27.023 --> 00:23:29.942
Did you miss me, Bill?

313
00:23:31.944 --> 00:23:33.904
Chow time, you guys.

314
00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:38.408
What are you looking
so provoked about?

315
00:23:39.492 --> 00:23:41.786
Did you miss me?

316
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.205
It's a normal question.

317
00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:47.917
I missed you.
But what do I get back?

318
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.169
Not an ounce of excitement.

319
00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:52.171
Not a whisper of a thrill.

320
00:23:53.714 --> 00:23:57.342
This relationship has all the
passion of a pair of titmice.

321
00:24:00.387 --> 00:24:02.722
I'm waiting outside
the front door.

322
00:24:02.805 --> 00:24:04.724
Did you speak to the governor?

323
00:24:04.807 --> 00:24:07.518
- He's coming.
- And his wife?

324
00:24:07.602 --> 00:24:09.979
Yeah, unfortunately.

325
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.148
I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo
benefit. It was better than Seconal.

326
00:24:13.232 --> 00:24:16.985
I'm waiting outside
the front door, Bill.

327
00:24:18.612 --> 00:24:21.072
Won't someone let me in?

328
00:24:22.574 --> 00:24:24.492
Lillian?

329
00:24:29.288 --> 00:24:31.790
- Is there somebody at the front door?
- I didn't hear a ring, sir.

330
00:24:31.874 --> 00:24:33.834
Have a look, would you, please?

331
00:24:34.877 --> 00:24:36.837
What about the mayor?

332
00:24:36.878 --> 00:24:38.806
He said he's going
to be there with bells on.

333
00:24:38.807 --> 00:24:39.507
Good.

334
00:24:39.589 --> 00:24:42.050
- Maybe they'll drown him out.
- Please don't be negative, Drew.

335
00:24:42.133 --> 00:24:42.834
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:42.835 --> 00:24:46.510
We have an acceptance list
that would do the White House proud:

337
00:24:46.512 --> 00:24:49.932
The chairman of the F.C.C.,
the Secretary General of the U.N.,

338
00:24:50.015 --> 00:24:52.142
- Wow.
- Nine senators,

339
00:24:52.226 --> 00:24:57.356
I don't know how many congressmen
and at least 12 of the Fortune 500.

340
00:24:57.397 --> 00:25:00.817
- Any jocks? Hmm?
- No.

341
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.320
No 20-game-winner, Masters champion,
someone I can talk to?

342
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.242
You were right, Mr. Parrish.
There was a gentleman at the door.

343
00:25:10.326 --> 00:25:12.828
He's waiting for you
in the foyer.

344
00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:18.609
Show him into the library.
Tell him I'll be right there.

345
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.610
Yes, sir.

346
00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:23.254
I've arranged favors, silver
charm bracelets for the women,

347
00:25:23.338 --> 00:25:25.548
- Mmm.
- And platinum key chains for the men,

348
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.217
all engraved "W.P."

349
00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:32.137
But now I'm thinking of scrubbing them.
They seem so ordinary.

350
00:25:32.221 --> 00:25:34.598
Are they ordinary?

351
00:25:34.681 --> 00:25:36.600
Do they seem that way
to you, Daddy?

352
00:25:37.684 --> 00:25:39.603
I don't know.

353
00:25:39.686 --> 00:25:42.438
I don't know.
I, uh...

354
00:25:49.945 --> 00:25:52.072
Let me see.

355
00:25:52.114 --> 00:25:54.074
I don't think they're ordinary.

356
00:25:54.116 --> 00:25:56.243
I think they're great.

357
00:25:56.326 --> 00:25:58.286
I love key chains.

358
00:26:15.093 --> 00:26:17.012
Hello?

359
00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:23.017
Anyone here?

360
00:26:26.562 --> 00:26:29.815
- I said, is anyone here?
- Quiet down.

361
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.658
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

362
00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:46.706
What is this, a joke, right?

363
00:26:46.747 --> 00:26:49.583
Some kind of elaborate
practical joke?

364
00:26:52.586 --> 00:26:56.715
At my 40th reunion,
we delivered a casket...

365
00:26:56.798 --> 00:27:00.010
to the class president's
hotel room and, uh...

366
00:27:00.093 --> 00:27:02.053
Quiet.

367
00:27:08.726 --> 00:27:11.979
Where are you going, Bill?

368
00:27:12.062 --> 00:27:14.314
I, uh...

369
00:27:14.398 --> 00:27:17.234
The great Bill Parrish
at a loss for words?

370
00:27:17.317 --> 00:27:22.238
The man from whose lips fall "rapture"
and "passion" and "obsession"?

371
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.242
All those admonitions about
being "deliriously happy",

372
00:27:26.284 --> 00:27:29.036
that there is no sense
living your life without.

373
00:27:29.078 --> 00:27:31.038
All the sparks and energy
you give off,

374
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.292
the rosy advice you dispense
in round, pear-shaped tones.

375
00:27:41.006 --> 00:27:43.132
What the hell is this?

376
00:27:52.391 --> 00:27:54.309
Who are you?

377
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.064
Just think of millenniums
multiplied by eons...

378
00:27:59.147 --> 00:28:01.733
compounded by time without end.

379
00:28:01.816 --> 00:28:03.943
I've been around that long.

380
00:28:04.027 --> 00:28:08.823
But it's only recently that your
affairs here have piqued my interest.

381
00:28:08.864 --> 00:28:11.200
Call it boredom.

382
00:28:11.283 --> 00:28:13.994
The natural curiosity of me,
the most lasting...

383
00:28:14.036 --> 00:28:18.582
and significant element in
existence, has come to see you.

384
00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:22.293
About what?

385
00:28:23.545 --> 00:28:27.131
I want to have a look around
before I take you.

386
00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.010
Take me where?

387
00:28:32.261 --> 00:28:36.223
It requires competence,
wisdom and experience.

388
00:28:36.264 --> 00:28:39.935
All those things they say
about you in testimonials.

389
00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:41.978
And you're the one.

390
00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:45.857
- The one to do what?
- Show me around,

391
00:28:46.899 --> 00:28:49.568
be my guide.

392
00:28:49.652 --> 00:28:52.863
And in return, you get...

393
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.200
I get what?

394
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.037
Time:

395
00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:04.290
Minutes, days, weeks.

396
00:29:04.374 --> 00:29:06.292
Let's not get encumbered
by detail.

397
00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:09.336
What matters is
that I stay interested.

398
00:29:15.592 --> 00:29:17.594
Yes.

399
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.890
"Yes" what?

400
00:29:21.931 --> 00:29:25.059
Yes is the answer
to your question.

401
00:29:28.396 --> 00:29:30.314
- What question?
- Oh, Bill.

402
00:29:30.397 --> 00:29:33.150
Come on. The question.

403
00:29:33.233 --> 00:29:37.112
The question you've been asking
yourself with increased regularity,

404
00:29:37.195 --> 00:29:40.323
at odd moments, panting through
the extra game of handball,

405
00:29:40.407 --> 00:29:42.534
when you ran for the plane
in Delhi,

406
00:29:42.617 --> 00:29:46.162
when you sat up in bed last night and
hit the floor in the office this morning.

407
00:29:46.245 --> 00:29:49.832
The question that is in
the back of your throat,

408
00:29:49.915 --> 00:29:52.334
choking the blood
to your brain,

409
00:29:52.418 --> 00:29:58.215
ringing in your ears over and
over as you put it to yourself.

410
00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:02.552
- "The question."
- Yes, Bill.

411
00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:04.554
"The question."

412
00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:11.977
The question.

413
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:19.359
Am I going to die?

414
00:30:29.368 --> 00:30:31.328
Yes.

415
00:30:37.709 --> 00:30:39.794
Am I dreaming this?

416
00:30:39.878 --> 00:30:41.796
Are you a dream?

417
00:30:43.047 --> 00:30:44.966
I'm not a dream.

418
00:30:46.134 --> 00:30:48.052
You're coming to take me?

419
00:30:49.553 --> 00:30:51.472
What is that?

420
00:30:51.555 --> 00:30:53.474
And who the hell are you?

421
00:31:24.877 --> 00:31:26.796
You are...

422
00:31:28.005 --> 00:31:30.174
Yes?

423
00:31:34.636 --> 00:31:36.763
Who am I?

424
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:48.399
Death.

425
00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:55.197
You're Death?

426
00:31:56.823 --> 00:31:59.451
Yes.

427
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:08.542
- Death.
- That's me.

428
00:32:10.794 --> 00:32:12.713
You're not Death.
You're just a kid in a suit.

429
00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:15.716
The suit came with
the body I took.

430
00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:18.593
Let me ask your opinion.

431
00:32:18.677 --> 00:32:20.595
Do I blend in?

432
00:32:25.516 --> 00:32:27.893
You want me
to be your guide?

433
00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:30.020
You fill the bill, Bill.

434
00:32:30.104 --> 00:32:32.064
- I do?
- Mmm.

435
00:32:33.857 --> 00:32:35.776
Will you be staying long?

436
00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:37.861
We should hope quite a while.

437
00:32:39.738 --> 00:32:41.656
And then?

438
00:32:48.245 --> 00:32:50.206
It's over.

439
00:32:51.582 --> 00:32:54.126
It's over.

440
00:32:54.209 --> 00:32:56.795
Mr. Parrish?

441
00:32:56.878 --> 00:32:58.839
Will the gentleman be staying
for dinner, sir?

442
00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:02.634
Yes.

443
00:33:06.762 --> 00:33:08.681
Thank you.

444
00:33:12.601 --> 00:33:14.520
This is crazy.

445
00:33:16.897 --> 00:33:18.815
You're not gonna
eat dinner with us.

446
00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:22.360
No, I am eating dinner with you...
and your family.

447
00:33:22.443 --> 00:33:24.362
And that is what we're doing.

448
00:33:24.445 --> 00:33:28.616
It's not open
for discussion, nothing is.

449
00:33:28.699 --> 00:33:31.285
Don't you understand?

450
00:33:34.204 --> 00:33:36.540
Yeah.

451
00:33:36.623 --> 00:33:38.792
Good.

452
00:33:38.834 --> 00:33:40.794
Now lead the way.

453
00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:44.797
Bill,

454
00:33:44.881 --> 00:33:46.841
lead the way.

455
00:33:54.306 --> 00:33:59.144
- Excuse me, may I say something?
- Yes, of course.

456
00:33:59.185 --> 00:34:01.438
Well, it just occurred
to me, if, uh...

457
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:03.356
Speak up, please.

458
00:34:03.439 --> 00:34:08.319
When I introduce you,
if I say who you are,

459
00:34:08.361 --> 00:34:11.322
I don't think anyone
will stay for dinner.

460
00:34:12.364 --> 00:34:14.366
Then don't.

461
00:34:14.408 --> 00:34:16.576
Here's another possibility.

462
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.622
It's a little last minute,
but tell me what you think.

463
00:34:20.705 --> 00:34:22.624
Kaleidoscopes.

464
00:34:23.833 --> 00:34:25.835
Little gold kaleidoscopes.

465
00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:28.754
Some German company went kerplunk,
and Tiffany's picked all these things up,

466
00:34:28.838 --> 00:34:31.715
and they're perfect
party favors.

467
00:34:31.757 --> 00:34:34.927
Okay, they're not personalized or
anything. They're just winter scenes...

468
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.928
dachshunds, snowflakes.

469
00:34:40.682 --> 00:34:42.600
Hi there.

470
00:34:44.936 --> 00:34:46.896
Hello.

471
00:34:48.022 --> 00:34:51.275
Sorry to have...
stepped away for so long.

472
00:34:51.358 --> 00:34:54.528
This is a friend of mine
I asked to drop by.

473
00:34:54.611 --> 00:34:58.031
We got to talking
and stuff, and, uh...

474
00:34:59.783 --> 00:35:01.701
He's gonna join us for dinner.

475
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.164
- Great.
- How nice to meet you.

476
00:35:07.248 --> 00:35:10.376
And wouldn't it be nicer if my
father would introduce you?

477
00:35:11.669 --> 00:35:13.629
How nice to meet you.

478
00:35:15.464 --> 00:35:19.134
Yeah, I'm sorry. This is my daughter,
Allison, and her husband, Quince,

479
00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:22.011
and Drew, my number one,
works with me.

480
00:35:23.638 --> 00:35:25.932
Daddy, does your friend
have a name?

481
00:35:25.973 --> 00:35:30.603
- A name?
- Something he goes by?

482
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.649
Oh, yeah, excuse me.
This is, uh...

483
00:35:35.732 --> 00:35:37.651
This is, um...

484
00:35:37.734 --> 00:35:40.779
- Daddy, come on. A name.
- Bill, the suspense is killing me.

485
00:35:40.862 --> 00:35:43.823
I'm sorry. It's, uh...
It's gone right out of my head. Um...

486
00:35:45.992 --> 00:35:49.412
I'm sorry. This is... Joe.

487
00:35:49.495 --> 00:35:52.831
- Joe. I love that name.
- Just plain Joe.

488
00:35:52.873 --> 00:35:55.542
Me too. Hey, buddy.

489
00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.797
- Is there any more to it?
- What do you mean?

490
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.883
Like "Smith" or "Jones" or...

491
00:36:08.804 --> 00:36:11.974
- Black.
- Oh, at last.

492
00:36:12.057 --> 00:36:15.269
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
- Hey, hey, Joe Black.

493
00:36:15.352 --> 00:36:18.313
Won 15, lost 2 for the
Brooklyn Dodgers, 1952.

494
00:36:18.396 --> 00:36:20.315
I'm king of my rotisserie league.

495
00:36:20.398 --> 00:36:23.193
- Are you?
- Yeah, he is.

496
00:36:24.736 --> 00:36:27.154
Shall we sit down?

497
00:36:27.238 --> 00:36:29.156
Right there.

498
00:37:18.116 --> 00:37:19.594
Have we met?

499
00:37:20.704 --> 00:37:24.290
- He's from out of town.
- How long you here for, Joe?

500
00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:28.085
As long as it takes.

501
00:37:30.212 --> 00:37:34.133
- You and Bill, you old friends?
- No.

502
00:37:37.969 --> 00:37:40.472
No, thank you.

503
00:37:40.513 --> 00:37:43.057
I have one, thank you.

504
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:45.727
I get the feeling you've
done some business before.

505
00:37:45.728 --> 00:37:46.828
I got it.

506
00:37:48.354 --> 00:37:50.397
Have you done
some business before?

507
00:37:52.024 --> 00:37:54.234
We have an arrangement now.

508
00:37:58.071 --> 00:38:01.074
What side of the industry
did you say you were on?

509
00:38:01.157 --> 00:38:03.743
I didn't say.

510
00:38:05.203 --> 00:38:07.163
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.

511
00:38:07.205 --> 00:38:10.166
I have a feeling you guys got
the broad strokes already.

512
00:38:10.249 --> 00:38:12.209
You need any help
with the details?

513
00:38:14.753 --> 00:38:17.089
I'm sorry, business at dinner.

514
00:38:18.924 --> 00:38:22.969
- Forgive me for being so rude.
- Certainly.

515
00:38:23.052 --> 00:38:25.012
Hi, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.

516
00:38:25.096 --> 00:38:27.316
I had to have dinner
with my department chief.

517
00:38:27.317 --> 00:38:28.317
You ate?

518
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.185
I'm here, aren't I? I wouldn't
miss a loose ends meeting.

519
00:38:31.268 --> 00:38:34.855
What's on the table for discussion?
Party favors, flowers...

520
00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:36.857
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

521
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.859
- Hello.
- Hi, Drew.

522
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.240
What are you doing here?

523
00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:49.035
You know each other?

524
00:38:52.538 --> 00:38:54.998
We've met.

525
00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:59.211
This morning,
the Corinth Coffee Shop.

526
00:38:59.294 --> 00:39:01.963
He was, uh...
He was looking for a doctor.

527
00:39:02.046 --> 00:39:05.800
Well, I guess he's found one.

528
00:39:05.883 --> 00:39:07.843
Joe, you do get around.

529
00:39:07.927 --> 00:39:10.679
- That's your name?
- And isn't it a lovely one?

530
00:39:10.763 --> 00:39:14.641
So sturdy, so straight.
Stop it.

531
00:39:14.725 --> 00:39:19.104
Incidentally, Joe,
where are you staying?

532
00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:23.483
- Here.
- You're staying here?

533
00:39:23.566 --> 00:39:29.113
- In this house?
- Yes, in this house.

534
00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:33.200
Great. Great. Great.

535
00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:35.994
Will that hold you, Joe?

536
00:39:36.078 --> 00:39:38.246
Incidentally, Joe what?

537
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.457
Black.

538
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.500
This is fun.

539
00:39:42.584 --> 00:39:45.336
Yes. Yes, Quince, it is.

540
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.630
So, what are you doing here, Joe?

541
00:39:55.679 --> 00:39:58.306
Cat got your tongue?

542
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.101
You weren't so silent this morning.

543
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.521
This morning, yes.

544
00:40:07.356 --> 00:40:09.233
I wasn't quite myself.

545
00:40:10.776 --> 00:40:15.280
Well, it's a shame whoever you were
couldn't be here tonight.

546
00:40:15.364 --> 00:40:17.407
Cut it out, Susan.
We've gotta talk.

547
00:40:17.491 --> 00:40:20.118
Busy day tomorrow, everybody.

548
00:40:21.745 --> 00:40:24.414
Joe, let's go.

549
00:40:24.497 --> 00:40:26.457
Yes.

550
00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:38.635
That stuff between
you and Susan threw me.

551
00:40:38.677 --> 00:40:40.637
Threw you? Where?

552
00:40:40.679 --> 00:40:42.639
Shook me up.

553
00:40:44.057 --> 00:40:46.726
I mean, how is it that you happened
to meet my daughter?

554
00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:48.936
I didn't meet her.

555
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.980
The young man I took met her.

556
00:40:51.021 --> 00:40:54.483
That is, the fellow she encountered in
the coffee shop this morning.

557
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:57.819
What happened to him?

558
00:40:57.903 --> 00:41:00.864
I needed a body, Bill.

559
00:41:04.742 --> 00:41:06.661
So,

560
00:41:09.997 --> 00:41:11.915
come in.

561
00:41:14.418 --> 00:41:20.173
Uh, bathroom,
tub, towels, sauna,

562
00:41:20.215 --> 00:41:23.301
chairs, lamps, bed.

563
00:41:39.274 --> 00:41:41.901
Well, if there is anything else,

564
00:41:43.987 --> 00:41:46.405
- don't hesitate.
- I won't.

565
00:43:01.307 --> 00:43:03.810
- I can try.
- Will she be available next week?

566
00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:05.812
I don't know.

567
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:09.482
Yes, sir?

568
00:43:09.523 --> 00:43:12.359
Hello. I'm Joe Black.

569
00:43:12.443 --> 00:43:14.361
It's nice meeting you.

570
00:43:14.444 --> 00:43:16.697
Yes, of course, Mr. Black, sir.

571
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.199
A pleasure.

572
00:43:19.282 --> 00:43:21.201
Eh...

573
00:43:22.285 --> 00:43:24.579
What is that?

574
00:43:24.662 --> 00:43:26.956
- You mean this, sir?
- Yes.

575
00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:30.501
It's, uh, Laura Scudder's
peanut butter, sir.

576
00:43:32.544 --> 00:43:34.505
You like it?

577
00:43:34.546 --> 00:43:37.174
Well, I would say,
in my opinion,

578
00:43:37.257 --> 00:43:41.302
it's right up there
with Jif and Skippy.

579
00:43:41.386 --> 00:43:43.304
Could I offer you
a taste, sir?

580
00:43:45.056 --> 00:43:46.974
- Yes.
- All right.

581
00:44:21.172 --> 00:44:23.132
Do you fancy it, sir?

582
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:28.220
More?

583
00:44:28.304 --> 00:44:30.222
Right.

584
00:44:38.939 --> 00:44:40.857
Mmm.

585
00:44:43.526 --> 00:44:46.320
Mmm.

586
00:44:46.404 --> 00:44:49.240
You're a peanut butter man
now, eh, sir?

587
00:44:51.325 --> 00:44:53.994
Yes, I believe I am.

588
00:44:55.245 --> 00:44:57.747
I thoroughly enjoy
this peanut butter.

589
00:44:59.165 --> 00:45:01.334
And I thoroughly enjoyed
meeting you all.

590
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.671
- I'll be moseying on.
- Right, sir.

591
00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:39.452
What are you doing here?

592
00:45:41.913 --> 00:45:44.332
I'm lost.

593
00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:48.794
I can't seem
to escape you today.

594
00:45:48.878 --> 00:45:52.548
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

595
00:46:12.316 --> 00:46:14.276
Would you hand me
one of those?

596
00:46:30.332 --> 00:46:34.920
You must have something very...
big going on with my father.

597
00:46:35.003 --> 00:46:36.963
- Big?
- Yeah.

598
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:40.508
You appear at his side
out of the blue,

599
00:46:40.592 --> 00:46:42.594
stay at his house,
have dinner with his family.

600
00:46:42.677 --> 00:46:46.681
That's, uh,
practically a first.

601
00:46:46.764 --> 00:46:50.142
You're in the red-hot center
of big business,

602
00:46:50.184 --> 00:46:52.144
and I thought you were
just a regular Joe.

603
00:46:53.687 --> 00:46:57.691
- I am Joe.
- Not the one that I met this morning.

604
00:46:57.774 --> 00:47:02.070
Hitting on me in as nice a way as
I've been hit on in a long time.

605
00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:06.115
The second that you found out
I was my father's daughter, you, uh...

606
00:47:06.199 --> 00:47:10.953
Well, you acted like a stranger.

607
00:47:11.036 --> 00:47:13.455
That is not my intention.

608
00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:17.626
What are your intentions?

609
00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:21.421
Huh?
I mean, just to, uh,

610
00:47:21.504 --> 00:47:24.882
make little dramas in coffee shops,
turn a woman's head?

611
00:47:24.924 --> 00:47:27.760
I don't mind admitting
that my-my head was turned.

612
00:47:27.843 --> 00:47:30.221
I... I liked it.

613
00:47:30.304 --> 00:47:35.225
But, well, ten hours later,
I feel like a fool.

614
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.728
I just don't get it. I don't.

615
00:47:38.812 --> 00:47:41.106
You, my father, here in this house.
It's, uh...

616
00:47:41.189 --> 00:47:45.151
It's upsetting me, and I...

617
00:47:45.234 --> 00:47:49.196
What happened to that sweet guy
from the coffee shop?

618
00:47:50.447 --> 00:47:52.408
Who are you, anyway?

619
00:47:53.826 --> 00:47:57.829
And... what are you eating?

620
00:47:59.247 --> 00:48:01.207
Peanut butter.

621
00:48:04.002 --> 00:48:05.920
Hmm.

622
00:48:06.003 --> 00:48:07.922
But it's gone now.

623
00:48:13.719 --> 00:48:15.637
Wh... No. Please.

624
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:19.734
You act like you've never
had peanut butter before.

625
00:48:19.735 --> 00:48:20.735
I haven't.

626
00:48:22.393 --> 00:48:25.146
- What kind of childhood did you have?
- Do you love Drew?

627
00:48:25.229 --> 00:48:27.356
Excuse me?

628
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.401
When you put your mouth
to his, it seemed a frequent thing.

629
00:48:33.153 --> 00:48:35.280
Drew is none of your business,

630
00:48:35.364 --> 00:48:38.033
and neither is where
I put my mouth.

631
00:48:38.116 --> 00:48:40.410
I'm sorry.
Do you live here?

632
00:48:40.493 --> 00:48:43.496
No, Joe, I'm swimming here
and now I'm going home.

633
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.791
Yes, I think what
I'm trying to say is,

634
00:48:46.874 --> 00:48:49.502
I would like it
if we were friends.

635
00:48:49.585 --> 00:48:52.212
I've got plenty of friends.

636
00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:54.965
I don't have any.

637
00:48:57.175 --> 00:48:59.552
Well, I can see why.

638
00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.936
I didn't mean
to offend you at dinner.

639
00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:11.355
I'm sometimes...

640
00:49:11.397 --> 00:49:15.234
not quite at home
around people.

641
00:49:17.152 --> 00:49:20.613
I get busy doing, uh,
what it is I do.

642
00:49:20.697 --> 00:49:24.701
And I don't seem
to have developed...

643
00:49:27.745 --> 00:49:29.914
Yes?

644
00:49:34.001 --> 00:49:39.798
I have a certain function to perform,
and it seems to take up most of my time.

645
00:49:41.132 --> 00:49:45.094
But sometimes I...
speculate...

646
00:49:47.597 --> 00:49:49.932
that I haven't
left room for...

647
00:49:52.893 --> 00:49:55.270
anything else.

648
00:49:58.773 --> 00:50:00.692
Hmm.

649
00:50:02.193 --> 00:50:04.529
I'm sorry to say
I know what you mean.

650
00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:19.501
Well, um...

651
00:50:22.462 --> 00:50:24.380
Good night, Joe.

652
00:50:24.464 --> 00:50:26.883
Yes.

653
00:50:26.966 --> 00:50:29.760
Good night to you, Susan.

654
00:50:32.137 --> 00:50:34.681
- Morning, Madeline.
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Parrish.

655
00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:37.309
- Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

656
00:50:37.392 --> 00:50:39.352
Good.

657
00:50:56.702 --> 00:50:59.037
Morning.

658
00:50:59.079 --> 00:51:01.414
Good morning, Bill.

659
00:51:07.003 --> 00:51:09.672
What's on the docket for today?

660
00:51:09.755 --> 00:51:14.384
- Docket?
- Hmm, yes. What shall we do?

661
00:51:14.468 --> 00:51:18.346
- Well, I have to go to work, and...
- Splendid. I'll join you.

662
00:51:18.388 --> 00:51:20.390
Oh.

663
00:51:20.432 --> 00:51:23.017
Would you like to ride or walk?

664
00:51:23.059 --> 00:51:26.646
Walk. I wish to see the world.

665
00:51:26.729 --> 00:51:31.358
This is crazy.
This is the left field thing of all time.

666
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.945
I, uh... I don't know
if I can get through this.

667
00:51:35.028 --> 00:51:38.240
- What do I do? What do I tell my family?
- You'll get through this, Bill.

668
00:51:38.323 --> 00:51:41.868
As far as your family's concerned,
uh, I wouldn't say anything.

669
00:51:41.951 --> 00:51:44.912
You'll ruin the great start
we had last night.

670
00:51:44.954 --> 00:51:49.542
Hmm. It felt as if I was
being treated like a person.

671
00:51:49.625 --> 00:51:51.585
Yes, Joe this, Joe that.

672
00:51:51.627 --> 00:51:55.797
A nice smile.
Quince passed me the rolls.

673
00:51:55.881 --> 00:52:00.927
No passion or rapture or any of these mighty
things you're so intent on imparting.

674
00:52:00.969 --> 00:52:03.096
But I am certain,

675
00:52:03.137 --> 00:52:06.265
should you say who I am,
our adventure would end abruptly.

676
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:08.809
Mm-hmm.

677
00:52:12.187 --> 00:52:15.232
And I did so enjoy your family.

678
00:52:17.692 --> 00:52:21.488
What about my family? This
adventure involves only me, right?

679
00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:24.490
What do you mean?

680
00:52:27.827 --> 00:52:31.038
I'll tell you what. You promise
this undertaking of yours...

681
00:52:31.121 --> 00:52:33.082
involves only me and, uh...

682
00:52:33.165 --> 00:52:35.584
And what?

683
00:52:35.667 --> 00:52:38.336
- I won't tell anyone who you are.
- Sounds fair enough.

684
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.673
- Good.
- Is it a deal?

685
00:52:41.756 --> 00:52:44.425
- A deal?
- Yeah.

686
00:52:44.509 --> 00:52:47.511
You give your word;
I give mine that we'll do what we say.

687
00:52:47.595 --> 00:52:48.300
Mm-hmm.

688
00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:51.472
It is a truth exchanged
between two people.

689
00:52:51.473 --> 00:52:53.559
- Bill?
- What?

690
00:52:53.642 --> 00:52:56.770
You have a deal. Ow!

691
00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:05.945
That's great.

692
00:53:08.739 --> 00:53:10.908
Great.

693
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:14.661
You know, I got to thinking.

694
00:53:14.745 --> 00:53:18.915
With you here
and seemingly occupied,

695
00:53:18.957 --> 00:53:22.001
how's your work going,
I mean, elsewhere?

696
00:53:22.085 --> 00:53:25.922
While you were shaving this morning,
you weren't just shaving.

697
00:53:26.005 --> 00:53:29.341
- What do you mean?
- You were hatching ideas,

698
00:53:29.425 --> 00:53:32.386
making plans,
arriving at decisions, right?

699
00:53:32.469 --> 00:53:34.429
Yeah, I guess so.

700
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:38.225
So you understand the concept.
While part of you is busy doing one thing,

701
00:53:38.308 --> 00:53:40.137
another part of you is doing another,

702
00:53:40.138 --> 00:53:42.838
perhaps even attending
to the problems of your work.

703
00:53:42.979 --> 00:53:45.857
- Correct?
- Of course.

704
00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.610
So you understand the idea.
Congratulations, Bill.

705
00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:52.905
Now multiply that by infinity,
take that to the depths of forever,

706
00:53:52.988 --> 00:53:55.657
and you still will barely have a
glimpse of what I'm talking about.

707
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.124
- Joe?
- Yes, Bill?

708
00:54:07.835 --> 00:54:10.254
How about giving a guy a break?

709
00:54:10.337 --> 00:54:12.297
Make an exception?

710
00:54:12.381 --> 00:54:15.801
- Well, there's one to every rule.
- Not this.

711
00:54:15.842 --> 00:54:18.845
And call my family. I'd like them
to have dinner with me tonight.

712
00:54:18.929 --> 00:54:22.182
Didn't the family
get together last night?

713
00:54:22.265 --> 00:54:26.644
- Jennifer.
- Of course, Mr. Parrish, right away.

714
00:54:26.686 --> 00:54:28.405
Uh, perhaps you'd like
to wait in my office.

715
00:54:28.406 --> 00:54:29.406
No.

716
00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:33.567
What I'm trying to say is this is a board
meeting and you're not a member.

717
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:37.320
I'm sure you'll find a way
to make it all right.

718
00:54:37.404 --> 00:54:40.490
Nice to meet you.

719
00:54:40.573 --> 00:54:42.534
Morning.

720
00:54:42.617 --> 00:54:44.577
Good morning.

721
00:54:47.038 --> 00:54:49.039
Thank you. Eddie.

722
00:54:49.123 --> 00:54:51.458
Uh, this is Joe Black.

723
00:54:51.542 --> 00:54:52.846
He's a...

724
00:54:53.947 --> 00:54:56.447
- ... personal associate of mine, and, uh...
- Hello, Quince.

725
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.090
- Hey.
- He'll be joining us this morning.

726
00:54:59.174 --> 00:55:03.428
I know this is unusual,
and my apologies, and, uh...

727
00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:06.389
Drew, carry on.
It's nice to see you.

728
00:55:06.472 --> 00:55:09.642
Didn't expect you, but, uh...

729
00:55:09.725 --> 00:55:11.769
certainly you can't get
enough of a good thing.

730
00:55:11.852 --> 00:55:15.397
- Thank you.
- Joe, would you like to sit there?

731
00:55:27.074 --> 00:55:29.034
Okay.

732
00:55:29.118 --> 00:55:33.580
Uh, the Board of Parrish Communications
is hereby called to order.

733
00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:35.624
Our sole order of...

734
00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:44.132
Our s...

735
00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:54.016
Our sole order
of business today is a, uh...

736
00:55:54.099 --> 00:55:57.269
is an acceptance of
John Bontecou's generous offer.

737
00:55:57.352 --> 00:55:58.771
And I think Bill...

738
00:55:58.772 --> 00:56:00.912
Do you have any more
of these delicious cookies?

739
00:56:00.913 --> 00:56:02.607
The jelly ones?

740
00:56:02.649 --> 00:56:04.901
Mmm, and a cup of tea.

741
00:56:04.984 --> 00:56:09.905
With milk, I think.
I'd like to try it English style. Yes.

742
00:56:09.989 --> 00:56:11.949
A cup of tea with milk, please.

743
00:56:11.991 --> 00:56:14.159
Is there anything else, Mr. Black?

744
00:56:14.243 --> 00:56:16.620
- How about some water?
- Why, yes, thank you.

745
00:56:16.661 --> 00:56:18.622
- Hot or cold?
- Cold.

746
00:56:18.663 --> 00:56:22.625
- And a glass?
- Mmm.

747
00:56:26.671 --> 00:56:31.342
Uh, to review. We're really crossing
the T's and dotting the I's here.

748
00:56:31.383 --> 00:56:35.262
Uh, Bill had a great and conclusive meeting
yesterday with John Bontecou,

749
00:56:35.345 --> 00:56:38.306
and all that remains for us
is to put it to a vote.

750
00:56:41.017 --> 00:56:45.605
Um, thank you.
Drew, um...

751
00:56:46.898 --> 00:56:49.191
Yeah.

752
00:56:49.275 --> 00:56:52.194
I did enjoy, or rather
I was interested...

753
00:56:52.236 --> 00:56:56.656
in meeting
John Bontecou yesterday,

754
00:56:56.782 --> 00:56:58.909
and, um...

755
00:57:00.493 --> 00:57:05.331
Impressive, I suppose.

756
00:57:05.415 --> 00:57:07.333
But, uh...

757
00:57:11.253 --> 00:57:13.755
But...

758
00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:17.259
It did get me to thinking.

759
00:57:18.969 --> 00:57:23.181
See, I started in this business
because this is what I wanted to do.

760
00:57:23.264 --> 00:57:27.810
I knew I wasn't gonna write
the great American novel.

761
00:57:27.893 --> 00:57:31.188
But I also knew there was more to life
than buying something for a dollar...

762
00:57:31.272 --> 00:57:34.149
and selling it for two.

763
00:57:34.233 --> 00:57:37.736
I'd hoped to create something,
something which could be...

764
00:57:37.819 --> 00:57:40.780
held to the highest standards.

765
00:57:40.822 --> 00:57:44.742
And what I realized was I...

766
00:57:44.826 --> 00:57:48.162
I wanted to give
the news to the world.

767
00:57:48.204 --> 00:57:52.541
And I wanted
to give it unvarnished.

768
00:57:52.624 --> 00:57:57.087
Uh, the more we all know about each other,
the greater the chance we will survive.

769
00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:00.840
Sure, I want to make a profit.
You can't exist without one, but, uh...

770
00:58:00.924 --> 00:58:05.219
John Bontecou is all profit.

771
00:58:05.303 --> 00:58:10.182
If we give him license to absorb
Parrish Communications...

772
00:58:10.266 --> 00:58:12.309
and he has his eye
on a few others after us...

773
00:58:12.393 --> 00:58:14.686
in order to reach the world,

774
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:18.690
you will have to go
through John Bontecou.

775
00:58:18.773 --> 00:58:20.859
And not only will you
have to pay him to do this,

776
00:58:20.942 --> 00:58:24.237
far more important,
you'll have to agree with him.

777
00:58:25.988 --> 00:58:29.825
Reporting the news is a privilege
and a responsibility.

778
00:58:29.909 --> 00:58:33.454
And it is not exploitable.

779
00:58:33.537 --> 00:58:36.748
Parrish Communications
has earned this privilege.

780
00:58:36.832 --> 00:58:40.293
John Bontecou wants to buy it.

781
00:58:41.753 --> 00:58:44.505
As your chairman,

782
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:47.091
I urge you to agree.

783
00:58:47.174 --> 00:58:50.302
This company is not for sale.

784
00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:58.768
It sounds like you're not leaving
much room for discussion.

785
00:58:58.852 --> 00:59:00.770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

786
00:59:00.854 --> 00:59:03.273
I know. I'm sorry, I...
Looks like I'm reversing my field.

787
00:59:03.356 --> 00:59:05.983
That's your privilege, Bill.
But given our needs,

788
00:59:06.067 --> 00:59:08.819
given the absolute necessity
for growth, given the future,

789
00:59:08.903 --> 00:59:12.614
the truth is, joining John Bontecou is
every bit as certain as death and taxes.

790
00:59:12.698 --> 00:59:15.501
- Death and taxes?
- Yes.

791
00:59:16.284 --> 00:59:18.995
- Death and taxes?
- Yes.

792
00:59:19.079 --> 00:59:22.248
- What an odd pairing.
- It's just a saying, Mr. Black.

793
00:59:22.332 --> 00:59:24.917
- Mmm. By whom?
- Doesn't matter.

794
00:59:25.001 --> 00:59:28.379
Then why'd you bring it up?

795
00:59:28.462 --> 00:59:30.464
You're not familiar
with the phrase, "In this world,

796
00:59:30.548 --> 00:59:32.674
nothing is certain
but death and taxes?"

797
00:59:32.758 --> 00:59:35.302
- Well, I am now.
- Glad I could be of some help.

798
00:59:35.385 --> 00:59:38.597
I keep regular office hours if there's any
further information you might need...

799
00:59:38.638 --> 00:59:41.641
on sayings, common phrases,
manners of speaking.

800
00:59:41.724 --> 00:59:46.020
My door's wide open. The tea
I can provide, perhaps even the milk.

801
00:59:46.103 --> 00:59:48.189
Low fat.

802
00:59:48.272 --> 00:59:50.316
Yeah, okay, well, uh...

803
00:59:50.399 --> 00:59:54.153
I think we've accomplished everything we're
going to this morning. Shall we adjourn?

804
00:59:54.194 --> 00:59:56.456
But the matter is still on the table, Bill.

805
00:59:56.657 --> 00:59:57.957
Joe?

806
00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.825
Yes.

807
01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:10.251
Thank you for
the delicious cookies.

808
01:00:12.628 --> 01:00:15.380
Mmm.

809
01:00:17.799 --> 01:00:20.343
Who is that guy?

810
01:00:22.303 --> 01:00:24.222
So...

811
01:00:25.598 --> 01:00:27.975
what's the deal here?

812
01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:31.145
You gonna be breathing down
my neck right till the very end?

813
01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:34.648
- I don't understand.
- I'd like to be alone for a while.

814
01:00:37.484 --> 01:00:41.988
- Are you sad, Bill?
- Yes, I am.

815
01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:44.032
Why don't you take a walk
or something, get some air?

816
01:00:44.115 --> 01:00:46.701
I know I'll be seeing you.

817
01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:50.371
Of course.

818
01:00:50.454 --> 01:00:53.707
Good. Now I'd like to be alone.

819
01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:55.792
This will hold you for a while.

820
01:00:55.876 --> 01:00:58.545
- You know about money, don't you?
- It can't buy happiness?

821
01:00:58.628 --> 01:01:01.464
Yeah. Uh, Jennifer?

822
01:01:01.548 --> 01:01:04.401
Give Mr. Black a map
of the city, would you?

823
01:01:04.402 --> 01:01:07.095
It's okay, Bill. I can manage.

824
01:01:13.225 --> 01:01:15.143
- Hi.
- Hi.

825
01:01:15.227 --> 01:01:18.230
- I need a medical record number for labs.
- Uh-huh.

826
01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:22.859
And, uh, will you try calling her
husband? The number's on top.

827
01:01:28.572 --> 01:01:31.116
Also, can you page me
when C.T.'s ready?

828
01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:33.827
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks, sweetie.

829
01:01:36.496 --> 01:01:39.582
How nice you look.
Is that your uniform?

830
01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:42.168
What are you doing here?

831
01:01:44.837 --> 01:01:48.049
- Are you ill?
- Oh, goodness, no.

832
01:01:48.132 --> 01:01:51.844
- Then why are you here, Joe?
- I'm here to see you.

833
01:01:54.221 --> 01:01:57.849
Joe, I don't... I don't have
time to see you right now.

834
01:01:57.933 --> 01:02:00.393
I'm, um, about to start
making rounds,

835
01:02:00.477 --> 01:02:03.396
and I'm examining back-to-back
patients until dinner, and, uh...

836
01:02:03.438 --> 01:02:05.731
Very well. I'll watch.

837
01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:06.826
Watch me do what?

838
01:02:06.827 --> 01:02:09.027
Make rounds and examine
back-to-back patients.

839
01:02:09.068 --> 01:02:12.363
Joe, that's impossible.

840
01:02:12.404 --> 01:02:15.907
- I'm a doctor.
- And I'll be a visitor.

841
01:02:15.991 --> 01:02:19.869
- Patients have visitors, not doctors.
- I don't mind.

842
01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:24.681
Miss? Miss?
Doctor.

843
01:02:24.765 --> 01:02:27.543
Oh, um, just one second.
I'll be right there.

844
01:02:27.585 --> 01:02:29.879
Please.
My mama is sicker than him.

845
01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.632
Okay.

846
01:02:37.427 --> 01:02:41.056
- Obeah.
- No, Mama.

847
01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:43.599
Obeah, man.

848
01:02:43.641 --> 01:02:46.602
- I goin' die.
- Mama, stop it. It's just a man.

849
01:02:46.686 --> 01:02:49.605
- What's Obeah?
- Bad spirit. She just all fever.

850
01:02:49.688 --> 01:02:52.608
- She don't mean nothing. Please help us.
- Of course.

851
01:02:52.691 --> 01:02:54.943
No Obeah, sister.

852
01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:57.487
Everything gonna be all right.

853
01:03:03.493 --> 01:03:06.078
- Have you registered?
- No.

854
01:03:06.162 --> 01:03:08.622
Okay.

855
01:03:16.288 --> 01:03:17.600
You gonna be all right mama?

856
01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:20.301
Go with the doctor lady.
Mama gonna be fine now.

857
01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:22.927
Don't leave.
Don't leave me.

858
01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:26.472
- She'll be right back, okay?
- Mama.

859
01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:38.858
- Obeah.
- Rahtid.

860
01:03:38.942 --> 01:03:41.486
Obeah evil.
I not evil, woman.

861
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:44.030
And what you is then?

862
01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:49.285
I from that next place.

863
01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:52.496
You waitin' here to take us?

864
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.040
Like you is
the bus driver to there?

865
01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.043
No, man, I on 'oliday.

866
01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:03.006
Some spot you pick.

867
01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.886
Oh. Mmm.

868
01:04:08.969 --> 01:04:12.473
The pain.
Pain is bad, bad.

869
01:04:12.556 --> 01:04:16.476
I don't have nothin' to do
with these things, you know.

870
01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.188
- Make it go away.
- Doctor lady make it all right.

871
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:24.067
Uh-uh. Not this pain.

872
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:27.862
This pain go
through and through me.

873
01:04:27.903 --> 01:04:30.239
- Make it go away.
- I can't, sister.

874
01:04:30.322 --> 01:04:33.867
You can, mister.

875
01:04:33.909 --> 01:04:35.869
Take me to that next place.

876
01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:39.080
- It's not your time now.
- Make it time.

877
01:04:39.164 --> 01:04:41.541
You can't fool with
the way things got to be.

878
01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:45.378
Please?

879
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.843
Where she was born.

880
01:04:55.595 --> 01:04:58.765
Close your eyes.

881
01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:00.767
Go on, sister.

882
01:05:33.088 --> 01:05:35.340
Soon.

883
01:05:39.344 --> 01:05:41.679
You... You can go with her.
I'll be right there.

884
01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:43.848
Come now, Mama.

885
01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:53.273
- She's in a great deal of pain.
- Yes.

886
01:05:56.318 --> 01:06:01.114
- Have you spent much time in the islands?
- Some.

887
01:06:04.158 --> 01:06:07.578
I realize now my being here,

888
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.080
uh, is not quite appropriate.

889
01:06:10.122 --> 01:06:13.959
Oh, no, please...
Please don't apologize.

890
01:06:15.085 --> 01:06:18.255
- Yes?
- Yeah.

891
01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:24.469
I'm glad that you came.

892
01:06:24.552 --> 01:06:29.140
Thank you, Susan.
I'm very happy to be here.

893
01:06:31.517 --> 01:06:35.187
Joe, I'm with Drew.

894
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.982
Not now.

895
01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:46.405
I have to go.

896
01:06:46.489 --> 01:06:50.659
- I'm sorry to say.
- Be sorry for nothing.

897
01:06:52.828 --> 01:06:56.206
Right.

898
01:06:56.289 --> 01:07:00.460
- Thanks, Joe.
- Good-bye, Susan.

899
01:07:12.346 --> 01:07:16.600
- Good?
- Mmm.

900
01:07:16.683 --> 01:07:21.479
- Yes, what is it?
- Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.

901
01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:24.273
A little Coleman's mustard.

902
01:07:25.858 --> 01:07:28.444
It's, uh, splendid.

903
01:07:28.527 --> 01:07:31.155
Glad you like it.

904
01:07:33.532 --> 01:07:38.119
My wife turned me on
to cold lamb sandwiches.

905
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:44.375
- Joan... was my wife.
- Mm-hmm.

906
01:07:56.845 --> 01:08:00.807
Yeah.
Cold lamb sandwiches.

907
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:05.561
Not as chewy as roast beef,
not as boring as chicken.

908
01:08:05.645 --> 01:08:09.857
She knew stuff like that.

909
01:08:12.735 --> 01:08:15.362
Everything reminds me of her.

910
01:08:15.445 --> 01:08:20.116
There isn't a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

911
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.079
One day she didn't feel well.
The next day she was gone.

912
01:08:29.416 --> 01:08:31.794
So what are you gonna do?

913
01:08:31.877 --> 01:08:35.464
Yeah.

914
01:08:35.547 --> 01:08:39.092
I guess you've heard all this
a trillion times before, huh?

915
01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.055
- More.
- Why didn't you stop me?

916
01:08:44.138 --> 01:08:46.599
I don't know.

917
01:08:49.894 --> 01:08:52.730
What was it like
when you first met?

918
01:08:53.981 --> 01:08:56.608
I thought you'd heard it
a trillion times before.

919
01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:59.944
This part I'm interested in.

920
01:09:06.159 --> 01:09:09.620
Well, she had on
this little blue suit...

921
01:09:13.624 --> 01:09:18.044
With a little white collar
that had a little...

922
01:09:18.128 --> 01:09:21.256
red piping on it.

923
01:09:24.675 --> 01:09:26.886
Yeah?

924
01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:31.515
Hi.

925
01:09:32.641 --> 01:09:35.644
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

926
01:09:36.978 --> 01:09:39.648
- No.
- Just kidding?

927
01:09:39.773 --> 01:09:43.151
Sit down, Drew.

928
01:09:43.234 --> 01:09:47.738
Uh, before I do, I was
hoping we might be alone, Bill.

929
01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:50.991
Well, Joe and I have
no secrets from each other.

930
01:09:51.075 --> 01:09:52.993
How nice for you both.

931
01:09:56.621 --> 01:10:01.167
Pardon my candor, but I was confounded
by your decision this morning.

932
01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:03.253
- Why?
- I was hired.

933
01:10:03.336 --> 01:10:07.256
You told me to help bring Parrish
Communications into the 21st century.

934
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.652
This merger is the vehicle.

935
01:10:08.653 --> 01:10:10.175
- In my estimation...
- Perhaps a merger is a way...

936
01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:13.470
to bring Bill's company into the
21st century, and perhaps it isn't.

937
01:10:13.554 --> 01:10:16.640
And perhaps cheating on your French
philosophers exam at the Groton School...

938
01:10:16.723 --> 01:10:20.352
was an expedient way to get
your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.

939
01:10:20.435 --> 01:10:25.898
Be that as it may, Drew, a question
can often be argued both ways.

940
01:10:25.982 --> 01:10:28.609
Joe, cut it out.
You too, Drew.

941
01:10:31.487 --> 01:10:33.274
I thought this was practically a done deal.

942
01:10:33.275 --> 01:10:35.575
Well, now it's undone, okay?

943
01:10:35.657 --> 01:10:38.785
Forget Bontecou.
Scrub him.

944
01:10:38.827 --> 01:10:42.330
I'm tired of his fancy name
and his fancy offer.

945
01:10:42.413 --> 01:10:45.666
I'm not going for it.

946
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:48.461
Okay.

947
01:10:57.302 --> 01:11:00.305
Bill,
why at this juncture...

948
01:11:00.388 --> 01:11:04.767
are you letting yourself be so
concerned by business matters?

949
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:08.687
'Cause I don't want anybody
buying up my life's work!

950
01:11:08.771 --> 01:11:11.607
Turning it into something
it wasn't meant to be.

951
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:16.153
A man wants to leave something behind.
He wants it left behind the way he made it.

952
01:11:16.194 --> 01:11:18.238
He wants it to be run
the way he ran it,

953
01:11:18.321 --> 01:11:20.824
with a sense of honor,
of dedication, of truth.

954
01:11:20.907 --> 01:11:23.534
Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself
a heart attack...

955
01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:26.704
and ruin my vacation.

956
01:11:44.303 --> 01:11:46.347
Now listen.

957
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.891
I read you all the way
on the Bontecou thing,

958
01:11:48.974 --> 01:11:52.895
and I know where you're coming from,
and I am with you 101 percent.

959
01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:55.856
Well, thank you, Quince.

960
01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.568
But I just gotta tell you,

961
01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:03.112
if mergers are in the wind,

962
01:12:03.196 --> 01:12:06.866
I've developed
some great prospects.

963
01:12:06.949 --> 01:12:09.743
And I want to come and talk to
you about... about 'em next week.

964
01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:12.079
- Next week?
- Yeah.

965
01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:16.416
Or the week after.

966
01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:21.254
- No good?
- No. Why, anything's possible.

967
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.799
- It's up to Joe.
- Joe.

968
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.718
You just don't know
how glad I am you're aboard,

969
01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.387
because anybody who can take
some of the weight off the old man,

970
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.807
I am...
I'm in his corner.

971
01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:38.228
- That's very gracious of you, Quince.
- Ah, it's no problem.

972
01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:42.232
Well, I'll leave you two alone,
because I can, uh...

973
01:12:42.315 --> 01:12:44.776
I can tell, you know...

974
01:12:44.817 --> 01:12:46.944
you got something in the fire.

975
01:12:52.574 --> 01:12:54.826
Now, look,
I know you're down.

976
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:59.331
But you know, when you're down,
there's no place to go but up.

977
01:12:59.372 --> 01:13:01.666
Up. Thanks, Quince.

978
01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:03.710
Forget about Bontecou.

979
01:13:03.793 --> 01:13:06.212
I got a couple other merger
possibilities up my sleeve,

980
01:13:06.295 --> 01:13:08.464
and I'm pitching 'em
to the old man.

981
01:13:08.547 --> 01:13:10.507
- Were you?
- Yeah.

982
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:13.802
- Hey, listen.
- Mm-hmm.

983
01:13:13.844 --> 01:13:17.264
We're gonna go in together.
I'll clue you in.

984
01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:20.767
The timing has gotta be right,

985
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:23.603
because the old man
says it's up to Joe.

986
01:13:27.106 --> 01:13:29.024
- He said it's up to Joe?
- Mm-hmm.

987
01:13:29.108 --> 01:13:31.860
- Those were his words?
- Yeah.

988
01:13:31.944 --> 01:13:33.904
- It's up to Joe, huh?
- Yeah.

989
01:13:33.987 --> 01:13:37.616
- That's what he said?
- That's what he... That's what he said.

990
01:13:37.699 --> 01:13:40.660
That's very interesting.

991
01:13:40.744 --> 01:13:43.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I thought so too.

992
01:13:51.587 --> 01:13:55.257
I want to thank you all
for coming.

993
01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.510
Uh, my family, um,
Allison and Quince,

994
01:13:58.593 --> 01:14:00.887
Susan and
the other members.

995
01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.267
And, uh...

996
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.895
So glad when we
can get together.

997
01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:13.607
I mean, I know
you all have busy lives.

998
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.276
- Look who's talking.
- Yeah. Speak for yourself.

999
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.820
Yeah.

1000
01:14:18.904 --> 01:14:23.616
I remember when you
were little girls, and, uh...

1001
01:14:23.658 --> 01:14:26.410
I love little girls.

1002
01:14:28.496 --> 01:14:33.333
And uh, now you're
all grown up, and I, um...

1003
01:14:33.417 --> 01:14:36.586
I had some words prepared,
but, uh,

1004
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:38.588
I've forgotten them.

1005
01:14:38.672 --> 01:14:42.091
Um...
Wait a minute, uh...

1006
01:14:45.845 --> 01:14:48.472
- There's so much I wanted to say, uh...
- Daddy?

1007
01:14:48.514 --> 01:14:53.102
- You could sit down if you want to.
- Yeah.

1008
01:14:53.185 --> 01:14:56.063
So many words I wanted to...

1009
01:14:56.146 --> 01:14:58.607
So much I wanted to say,
but, uh...

1010
01:15:01.025 --> 01:15:03.695
I can't, and so, uh...

1011
01:15:03.778 --> 01:15:06.697
Yeah, I better sit down.

1012
01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:11.869
Carry on, everybody, please.
Oh, one other thing.

1013
01:15:13.454 --> 01:15:16.706
Um, why don't we all...

1014
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:19.751
have dinner again
tomorrow night, okay?

1015
01:15:19.834 --> 01:15:21.794
- Dinner again?
- Yeah.

1016
01:15:21.878 --> 01:15:24.714
You haven't had
enough of us yet, Dad?

1017
01:15:26.424 --> 01:15:29.009
Mmm...

1018
01:15:29.093 --> 01:15:32.179
mmm...

1019
01:15:32.262 --> 01:15:34.181
no.

1020
01:15:37.434 --> 01:15:40.186
Come here.

1021
01:15:41.896 --> 01:15:44.482
- We'll be here.
- You bet we'll be here.

1022
01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:46.651
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

1023
01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.905
Joe.

1024
01:16:00.288 --> 01:16:02.582
Oh, no.

1025
01:16:02.665 --> 01:16:06.127
I would prefer
some peanut butter.

1026
01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:10.023
How would you like that, sir?
On some kind of toast?

1027
01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.324
Toast.

1028
01:16:12.007 --> 01:16:15.927
- No, just the butter.
- Right away, sir.

1029
01:16:17.304 --> 01:16:20.098
Why do you like
peanut butter so much?

1030
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.141
I don't know.

1031
01:16:22.183 --> 01:16:24.977
Hmm. I adore things like that.

1032
01:16:25.019 --> 01:16:28.189
Food I can't do without.
Don't you?

1033
01:16:28.272 --> 01:16:30.191
Yes.

1034
01:16:30.274 --> 01:16:33.110
- It comforts you, doesn't it?
- Yes, I find that it does.

1035
01:16:34.152 --> 01:16:36.696
- Mind if I throw up?
- Drew.

1036
01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.990
Please.

1037
01:16:43.703 --> 01:16:47.248
I'm very concerned about the woman
you attended to today.

1038
01:16:47.331 --> 01:16:50.751
- I am too.
- Has her pain abated?

1039
01:16:50.834 --> 01:16:54.254
We're doing what we can
for her, but, uh,

1040
01:16:54.338 --> 01:16:56.757
it's not looking very good.

1041
01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.342
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

1042
01:16:59.426 --> 01:17:01.553
Who are we talking about?

1043
01:17:01.636 --> 01:17:04.847
But I know she's grateful
for the care you're giving her.

1044
01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:07.308
Is this a state secret?

1045
01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:09.911
No, we're talking about
a patient of mine, 'cause...

1046
01:17:09.912 --> 01:17:10.812
Uh-huh.

1047
01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:13.272
Joe stopped by
the hospital today.

1048
01:17:13.355 --> 01:17:17.234
He did?
That's more than we get to do.

1049
01:17:17.317 --> 01:17:20.278
Maybe next time you go to the
hospital, you'll take us along with you.

1050
01:17:20.362 --> 01:17:22.739
- Perhaps you could remind me.
- Well, I'll make a note of it.

1051
01:17:22.822 --> 01:17:25.616
- Anything else I can do for you?
- I wanna come along too.

1052
01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.952
- See Susie strut her stuff.
- You're on, Quincie.

1053
01:17:28.035 --> 01:17:32.915
Destination, hospital. Joe, you
can be the tour guide, okay?

1054
01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:38.795
Susan's a wonderful doctor.

1055
01:17:38.878 --> 01:17:41.422
I'm sure she is.

1056
01:17:45.593 --> 01:17:47.553
- Bill?
- Yeah?

1057
01:17:47.595 --> 01:17:49.555
I have to go.
It's been a hell of a day.

1058
01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:50.925
I need a few minutes
to sort everything out.

1059
01:17:50.926 --> 01:17:52.226
See you tomorrow.

1060
01:17:58.605 --> 01:18:00.523
Joe?

1061
01:18:04.235 --> 01:18:06.529
Yes, Bill?

1062
01:18:06.612 --> 01:18:08.989
Um...

1063
01:18:15.412 --> 01:18:18.915
- Why'd you go to the hospital?
- I don't know.

1064
01:18:18.999 --> 01:18:22.544
- You just curious?
- I guess.

1065
01:18:22.627 --> 01:18:25.463
About Susan?

1066
01:18:25.505 --> 01:18:28.841
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- How would you put it?

1067
01:18:31.218 --> 01:18:35.055
- You tell me, Bill.
- No, how about you telling me?

1068
01:18:35.138 --> 01:18:37.641
I ask a simple question;
I expect a straight answer.

1069
01:18:37.724 --> 01:18:40.727
That's what I'm used to.
Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.

1070
01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.605
Are you going to fire me, Bill?

1071
01:18:48.317 --> 01:18:50.277
Drew?

1072
01:18:51.362 --> 01:18:54.072
So, uh, I'll see you
tomorrow night?

1073
01:18:54.156 --> 01:18:58.285
You include me out. I've had
enough of the convocations.

1074
01:18:58.368 --> 01:19:02.747
You don't mean that.
You don't want to disappoint Dad.

1075
01:19:02.789 --> 01:19:07.251
Daddy will do fine. Besides, he's
got Joe. And it seems you do too.

1076
01:19:07.335 --> 01:19:08.754
You're out of line.

1077
01:19:08.755 --> 01:19:10.755
Well, that may be,
but I don't like the ubiquitous creep.

1078
01:19:10.838 --> 01:19:14.341
I don't like the way he looks at you.
I don't like the way he talks to you.

1079
01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:17.761
And vice versa.

1080
01:19:21.514 --> 01:19:23.933
I'm sorry.

1081
01:19:26.269 --> 01:19:30.147
'Cause I like the way
he looks and talks to me.

1082
01:19:30.231 --> 01:19:32.649
And vice versa.

1083
01:19:35.152 --> 01:19:37.237
Okay?

1084
01:19:38.655 --> 01:19:40.615
Not okay.

1085
01:19:42.116 --> 01:19:44.702
Thought we had
a good thing going here.

1086
01:19:44.786 --> 01:19:47.663
I thought
it was a good thing.

1087
01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:51.750
Well, that just goes to show
you never know.

1088
01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:57.089
Night.

1089
01:19:57.130 --> 01:20:00.133
Good night.

1090
01:20:20.193 --> 01:20:23.112
How long have you
been standing there?

1091
01:20:25.364 --> 01:20:28.492
I don't like the way
he spoke to you.

1092
01:20:28.534 --> 01:20:31.662
But I feel better now because
of the way you spoke back.

1093
01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:39.002
Tell me about yourself, Joe.

1094
01:20:39.044 --> 01:20:41.004
I mean, who are you?

1095
01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:45.174
What are you doing here
with my father?

1096
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.722
You're not going to tell me?

1097
01:21:02.398 --> 01:21:04.984
You're married, aren't you?

1098
01:21:05.067 --> 01:21:08.237
Why?

1099
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:13.117
Because men who never say anything
about themselves, they're...

1100
01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.827
they're always married.

1101
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:26.212
- So you're married?
- No, I'm not.

1102
01:21:28.089 --> 01:21:31.467
But you...
you have a girlfriend.

1103
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:34.761
No.

1104
01:21:36.471 --> 01:21:40.183
- Gay?
- No.

1105
01:21:47.732 --> 01:21:50.568
So, tell me, Joe...

1106
01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:57.115
How come a man
as attractive, intelligent,

1107
01:21:57.157 --> 01:22:01.119
well-spoken...

1108
01:22:04.205 --> 01:22:09.126
diffident in the most
seductive way, and yet...

1109
01:22:12.046 --> 01:22:14.798
powerful...

1110
01:22:18.051 --> 01:22:20.929
is all alone in this world?

1111
01:22:34.566 --> 01:22:37.068
I'm sorry.

1112
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:41.072
I'm s... I didn't...

1113
01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:45.368
mean to pry, and, uh,

1114
01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:48.829
you obviously don't
want to tell me,

1115
01:22:48.913 --> 01:22:51.623
so we'll just...

1116
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:56.503
We'll just leave it a mystery.

1117
01:23:01.382 --> 01:23:05.303
- That is the way you want it, isn't it?
- Yes, thank you.

1118
01:23:18.106 --> 01:23:20.984
Where are you going?

1119
01:23:21.067 --> 01:23:23.278
To bed.

1120
01:23:23.361 --> 01:23:26.447
- To bed?
- Yes.

1121
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:29.033
I'm tired.

1122
01:23:34.746 --> 01:23:37.207
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night. Sleep well.

1123
01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:40.627
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Good night. See you.

1124
01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:42.629
- Good night, Susie. Get some sleep.
- Good night.

1125
01:23:42.712 --> 01:23:44.630
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.

1126
01:23:44.714 --> 01:23:46.799
- Good night.
- Good night.

1127
01:23:50.511 --> 01:23:53.472
- That was wonderful.
- Mmm.

1128
01:23:53.514 --> 01:23:56.516
- It's good to get together.
- Mm-hmm.

1129
01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:05.441
Do you mind if I raise
a little caution flag?

1130
01:24:05.525 --> 01:24:08.694
Raise away.

1131
01:24:08.778 --> 01:24:12.573
What is the nature
of your interest in Joe?

1132
01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:16.993
Well...

1133
01:24:17.035 --> 01:24:20.497
Remember how you told me
about lightning striking?

1134
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.707
Mm-hmm.

1135
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:26.836
The nature of it's
in there somewhere.

1136
01:24:26.919 --> 01:24:30.839
Yeah. Well, I won't say you're
on the wrong track, but, uh...

1137
01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:33.342
Then what will you say?

1138
01:24:37.596 --> 01:24:41.599
I don't think this is the
lightning you're looking for.

1139
01:24:41.683 --> 01:24:46.562
I mean, Drew is a good man. I know I didn't
seem to be completely in his corner before,

1140
01:24:46.604 --> 01:24:49.190
but, uh, I've come
to appreciate that, um...

1141
01:24:49.273 --> 01:24:52.943
Now we love Drew?
And Joe doesn't measure up?

1142
01:24:53.026 --> 01:24:57.739
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1143
01:24:57.781 --> 01:25:00.784
When you say "nothing"
that way, it is not nothing.

1144
01:25:00.867 --> 01:25:03.202
- Then what is it?
- It's something.

1145
01:25:07.998 --> 01:25:11.377
- Okay.
- Good night.

1146
01:25:11.418 --> 01:25:15.297
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Good night.

1147
01:25:21.636 --> 01:25:25.056
I know you're all as uncomfortable
as I am to be meeting like this.

1148
01:25:25.139 --> 01:25:28.934
But I got a call last night
from John Bontecou.

1149
01:25:28.976 --> 01:25:33.689
Not only is he still interested,
he's sweetening his offer.

1150
01:25:35.774 --> 01:25:38.318
Although it pains me
to say it, in my opinion,

1151
01:25:38.401 --> 01:25:42.238
Bill Parrish dealt with us
pre-emptively...

1152
01:25:42.322 --> 01:25:44.907
in dismissing any deal
with Bontecou.

1153
01:25:44.991 --> 01:25:49.578
Therefore, I'm sorry to say that if we're
to examine this new offer responsibly,

1154
01:25:49.662 --> 01:25:52.748
as the Board of Directors
of Parrish Communications,

1155
01:25:52.831 --> 01:25:57.294
we must do so
without its chairman.

1156
01:25:57.377 --> 01:25:59.838
There's one additional element.

1157
01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:02.340
Bontecou is so anxious
to get us,

1158
01:26:02.382 --> 01:26:07.762
he said he'd take Parrish Communications
with Bill Parrish or without.

1159
01:26:15.811 --> 01:26:17.854
In this crisis, and be assured...

1160
01:26:17.938 --> 01:26:21.608
this is a crisis,

1161
01:26:21.691 --> 01:26:23.776
it's not pleasant
to say the following.

1162
01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:27.196
But I would be remiss if I did not.

1163
01:26:27.238 --> 01:26:30.324
When we present Bill with the
improved Bontecou offer,

1164
01:26:30.407 --> 01:26:32.826
and if he still refuses
to let us consider it,

1165
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:38.290
once more makes an adamant or emotional
rejection, we will have no choice but to...

1166
01:26:38.373 --> 01:26:41.251
You're taking this too far, Drew.

1167
01:26:42.794 --> 01:26:44.962
Am I not obligated to?

1168
01:26:50.884 --> 01:26:53.637
See if Quince is here.

1169
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.015
How did all this come about?

1170
01:26:57.099 --> 01:27:00.894
Crisis, Bill Parrish. Crisis,
his company. Crisis for us.

1171
01:27:00.977 --> 01:27:04.647
It came about with the arrival
on the scene of Mr. Joe Black.

1172
01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:08.859
Mr. Joe who?
Joe Black.

1173
01:27:08.943 --> 01:27:11.820
He attends our board meetings.

1174
01:27:11.904 --> 01:27:15.115
He sleeps at Bill's house.
He resides in his office.

1175
01:27:15.157 --> 01:27:17.242
He never leaves his side,
and, in my opinion,

1176
01:27:17.325 --> 01:27:19.744
is always in his ear,
telling Bill what to do.

1177
01:27:19.828 --> 01:27:21.996
And Bill is listening.

1178
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.874
Who is Joe Black?

1179
01:27:24.957 --> 01:27:27.418
What... What is his relationship
to Bill Parrish,

1180
01:27:27.501 --> 01:27:31.338
and most important, what is behind
his influence on our chairman?

1181
01:27:31.422 --> 01:27:36.885
He's had advisors before.
Nobody tells Bill what to do.

1182
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:45.351
- Thanks for coming, Quince.
- Sure. Hi, Ed.

1183
01:27:45.393 --> 01:27:49.146
Hi, folks.

1184
01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:52.316
I didn't know everybody
was going to be here.

1185
01:27:52.357 --> 01:27:55.610
Nice surprise.

1186
01:27:55.694 --> 01:27:57.612
What's with the new digs?

1187
01:27:57.696 --> 01:28:02.200
Drew's idea of cloak and dagger.
This is a secret meeting, Quince.

1188
01:28:02.283 --> 01:28:05.411
I hope you'll
respect its nature.

1189
01:28:14.628 --> 01:28:16.546
Have a seat, Quince.

1190
01:28:31.435 --> 01:28:34.771
Now, what we're trying
to do here is to, uh...

1191
01:28:34.855 --> 01:28:39.776
to gather our thoughts in light of
Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer...

1192
01:28:39.859 --> 01:28:42.237
and to make an appropriate
presentation to him...

1193
01:28:42.278 --> 01:28:45.698
as to how we think
the company might proceed.

1194
01:28:45.781 --> 01:28:49.577
Won't you share with our board the
information you gave me last night?

1195
01:28:52.538 --> 01:28:57.626
Well, uh, I'm hap... I'm happy
to tell you I got good news.

1196
01:28:57.709 --> 01:29:00.795
As I was, uh,
as I was telling Drew,

1197
01:29:00.879 --> 01:29:05.591
uh, I've been making a little hay while
the Bontecou sun was shining.

1198
01:29:05.675 --> 01:29:09.637
Two, possibly three, new and
boiling hot prospects for merger.

1199
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.890
Mm-hmm. And how did Bill react
to the leads you've developed?

1200
01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:13.920
He was interested.

1201
01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:17.521
Yeah, but he was
concerned about the timing?

1202
01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.774
- Timing?
- Yeah, he was concerned about the timing?

1203
01:29:22.815 --> 01:29:26.611
Yes. He says it's up to Joe.

1204
01:29:29.738 --> 01:29:32.157
It's up to Joe.

1205
01:29:47.713 --> 01:29:50.341
- ♪ Dum-da-dum ♪
- What's this?

1206
01:29:50.424 --> 01:29:55.095
- Um, Annie made them.
- Who's Annie?

1207
01:29:55.178 --> 01:29:58.014
Thank you, Lillian.
From La Rosette?

1208
01:29:58.056 --> 01:30:01.392
She's only the most famous
pastry chef in America.

1209
01:30:01.476 --> 01:30:05.146
Um, this is orange,
made with real Seville oranges.

1210
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:08.816
And, uh, that's lemon
on a Mille-feuille crust.

1211
01:30:08.858 --> 01:30:12.194
I don't like cake.

1212
01:30:12.236 --> 01:30:14.988
It's for the party, Dad.

1213
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:18.491
Ah. The goddamn party.

1214
01:30:18.575 --> 01:30:21.661
The goddamn party.
Mm-hmm.

1215
01:30:21.744 --> 01:30:24.288
- Did you hear that?
- I'm sorry.

1216
01:30:25.581 --> 01:30:28.667
The goddamn party. Oh.

1217
01:30:28.751 --> 01:30:31.462
- Come on, I...
- Here, let's try this one...

1218
01:30:31.545 --> 01:30:34.381
right over here.

1219
01:30:37.008 --> 01:30:39.886
Mmm.

1220
01:30:39.928 --> 01:30:44.474
This, this is terrific.
It has, um,

1221
01:30:44.557 --> 01:30:46.934
has vodka in it, Bill.

1222
01:30:46.976 --> 01:30:49.019
A little vodka, right?

1223
01:30:49.103 --> 01:30:51.063
Has, um, that fruity vodka,
that flavored stuff, right?

1224
01:30:51.146 --> 01:30:54.942
Bill, put your lips around this.
It's just out of this world.

1225
01:30:54.983 --> 01:30:59.070
I'm sorry, honey.
You know, I'm no good at this.

1226
01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:01.072
Why don't you choose
whichever cake you'd like?

1227
01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:04.200
- Hmm?
- I knew you were gonna say that.

1228
01:31:04.283 --> 01:31:06.786
- What?
- I mean you just don't care.

1229
01:31:06.827 --> 01:31:10.539
Oh, why am I doing this?
I should have my head examined again.

1230
01:31:10.623 --> 01:31:15.752
Oh, my God. I am trying to
throw the party of the century...

1231
01:31:15.836 --> 01:31:18.546
For my father in two days.

1232
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:20.590
- And you just don't give a shit.
- He gives a shit.

1233
01:31:20.673 --> 01:31:23.551
- He doesn't give a shit!
- He does.

1234
01:31:23.634 --> 01:31:26.304
- Allison.
- He does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?

1235
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:30.975
Come on. Come on.

1236
01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.313
- Come on. Smile.
- I'm sorry.

1237
01:31:41.025 --> 01:31:43.653
But what should we tell Annie?

1238
01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:47.448
♪ Bum-bum-bum ♪

1239
01:31:49.533 --> 01:31:53.495
This one. Mmm.

1240
01:31:53.579 --> 01:31:55.100
He gives a shit!

1241
01:31:59.751 --> 01:32:02.337
Fantastic.

1242
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.798
Thank you.

1243
01:32:13.055 --> 01:32:15.891
Um, Mr. Black, would you
care for a piece?

1244
01:32:15.974 --> 01:32:18.435
Yes, I'd love one.

1245
01:32:24.774 --> 01:32:26.817
Have you had a chance
to, uh,

1246
01:32:26.901 --> 01:32:30.738
look at my father's rare books?

1247
01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:35.867
He has Jefferson's
parliamentary manual, and, uh,

1248
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:38.411
this first edition of Bleak House.

1249
01:32:38.453 --> 01:32:41.247
I love your smell.

1250
01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.839
Well, I like
the way you smell too.

1251
01:32:58.013 --> 01:33:02.183
My mom always used to say that
you could set your heart by that clock.

1252
01:33:08.439 --> 01:33:11.525
Could you?

1253
01:33:11.608 --> 01:33:14.027
I never tried.

1254
01:33:16.822 --> 01:33:19.866
Till now.

1255
01:33:24.537 --> 01:33:27.123
- Joe?
- Hmm?

1256
01:33:30.501 --> 01:33:33.295
May I kiss you?

1257
01:33:33.337 --> 01:33:36.339
Why, yes, you can.

1258
01:34:01.237 --> 01:34:03.656
Mmm.

1259
01:34:43.276 --> 01:34:45.653
Thank you.

1260
01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:50.324
You're welcome.

1261
01:34:54.786 --> 01:34:59.290
- Joe?
- Mmm.

1262
01:34:59.374 --> 01:35:02.877
I don't know who you are.

1263
01:35:06.631 --> 01:35:09.633
- I'm Joe.
- Mm-hmm.

1264
01:35:09.717 --> 01:35:13.554
And, uh, you're Susan.

1265
01:35:13.637 --> 01:35:16.390
Mmm.

1266
01:35:16.473 --> 01:35:19.851
And... I have this...

1267
01:35:19.893 --> 01:35:22.353
weak feeling in my knees.

1268
01:35:22.437 --> 01:35:25.857
- And is your heart beating strangely?
- Yes.

1269
01:35:25.898 --> 01:35:27.900
- Mm-hmm.
- Faster.

1270
01:35:29.276 --> 01:35:32.196
The taste of your lips
and the touch of your tongue...

1271
01:35:32.237 --> 01:35:34.364
that was wonderful.

1272
01:35:35.449 --> 01:35:37.409
Mmm.

1273
01:35:42.247 --> 01:35:44.165
I should, um...

1274
01:35:45.249 --> 01:35:47.168
I should go home.

1275
01:35:47.251 --> 01:35:50.212
Mmm.

1276
01:35:50.254 --> 01:35:52.756
Shouldn't I?

1277
01:35:55.133 --> 01:35:57.552
Yeah.

1278
01:36:22.492 --> 01:36:26.287
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

1279
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:34.002
Hello, Bill.

1280
01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:39.758
Hello.

1281
01:36:43.052 --> 01:36:46.722
Would you like to join me and
Allison and Quince for a nightcap?

1282
01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:52.227
No. Not right now.

1283
01:36:56.314 --> 01:36:58.650
Okay.

1284
01:37:01.319 --> 01:37:03.279
Then I'll say good night.

1285
01:37:03.321 --> 01:37:05.281
Good night, Bill.

1286
01:37:15.332 --> 01:37:17.751
Morning, Quince.
Top of the morning, B.P.

1287
01:37:17.834 --> 01:37:20.378
- Hello, Quince.
- Hey!

1288
01:37:23.089 --> 01:37:26.092
- Hello, Jennifer.
- Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

1289
01:37:26.175 --> 01:37:28.427
- The board is waiting.
- What?

1290
01:37:28.511 --> 01:37:31.305
- The board?
- Didn't you call a board meeting?

1291
01:37:31.388 --> 01:37:33.015
No.

1292
01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:47.653
- Good morning.
- Morning, Bill.

1293
01:37:47.737 --> 01:37:50.990
Did you want to have a
cup of coffee or something, Bill?

1294
01:37:53.575 --> 01:37:57.579
I don't think so.
Do you?

1295
01:37:57.662 --> 01:38:02.750
To get to the point, we've received
new information from John Bontecou...

1296
01:38:02.834 --> 01:38:05.586
concerning his desires for this
company to merge with his.

1297
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:08.339
And we wanted
to set the details before you.

1298
01:38:08.422 --> 01:38:11.342
Is that it? Bontecou wants
a quick response, and...

1299
01:38:11.425 --> 01:38:14.303
The answer is no.
Quick enough for you?

1300
01:38:14.386 --> 01:38:16.763
- Don't you want to hear the details?
- I'm not interested.

1301
01:38:16.847 --> 01:38:20.100
I'm not interested in the big picture
either. What I am interested in...

1302
01:38:20.183 --> 01:38:22.727
is how my board got convened
behind my back...

1303
01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:24.865
and is entertaining a further proposal

1304
01:38:24.866 --> 01:38:27.766
from a man with whom it
offends me to do business.

1305
01:38:28.107 --> 01:38:31.735
I made a decision.
Case closed.

1306
01:38:31.777 --> 01:38:34.696
So am I to understand
from your response...

1307
01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:37.574
that you do not want to hear
the details of Bontecou's offer?

1308
01:38:37.616 --> 01:38:39.576
Yes, you are
to understand that.

1309
01:38:39.617 --> 01:38:41.911
And now, may I ask
you a question?

1310
01:38:41.953 --> 01:38:45.665
- Certainly, Bill.
- Are you running this board, or am I?

1311
01:38:50.336 --> 01:38:52.254
That's it?

1312
01:38:54.214 --> 01:38:57.259
We've got a busy day ahead.
This meeting's already set me behind.

1313
01:38:57.342 --> 01:38:58.687
Shall we adjourn?

1314
01:38:58.688 --> 01:39:00.888
Uh, before we do, Bill,
while we're here...

1315
01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:03.973
There's a second question the
board would like a response to.

1316
01:39:04.057 --> 01:39:07.893
Far simpler one.

1317
01:39:07.935 --> 01:39:10.813
Who is the man
standing to your left?

1318
01:39:13.899 --> 01:39:16.693
I've already introduced
Mr. Black to you all.

1319
01:39:16.735 --> 01:39:19.654
But who is he?
What are his credentials?

1320
01:39:19.738 --> 01:39:22.323
What is his relationship to you?

1321
01:39:28.913 --> 01:39:31.874
The board is deeply concerned.

1322
01:39:31.915 --> 01:39:35.377
We have reason to believe Mr. Black is
not only influencing your decisions...

1323
01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.546
in regard to this company,

1324
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:41.216
but that you are relying
on him to make them for you.

1325
01:39:45.469 --> 01:39:48.305
The lack of response, Bill,
is not appropriate.

1326
01:39:48.389 --> 01:39:50.891
We are your board.

1327
01:39:50.933 --> 01:39:54.311
We have a right to know how you are
managing the operations of this company.

1328
01:39:54.394 --> 01:39:59.065
And, most importantly, that you have
not delegated someone to do it for you.

1329
01:39:59.107 --> 01:40:01.109
Okay?

1330
01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.530
One more time.
Who is Joe Black?

1331
01:40:16.748 --> 01:40:19.626
A motion has been brought
before the board...

1332
01:40:19.668 --> 01:40:22.629
to invoke Article 19
of the corporate charter.

1333
01:40:22.670 --> 01:40:24.964
In English, please.

1334
01:40:29.301 --> 01:40:34.014
Mandatory retirement
on our chairman's 65th birthday,

1335
01:40:34.097 --> 01:40:36.892
at which time the chairman
will be named emeritus.

1336
01:40:36.975 --> 01:40:39.936
You're welcome to attend
all meetings...

1337
01:40:40.019 --> 01:40:43.022
and will serve as international
spokesman for the corporation.

1338
01:40:43.106 --> 01:40:45.441
Plus, of course,
a settlement,

1339
01:40:45.525 --> 01:40:49.278
a golden parachute of such magnitude
that his feet will never touch the ground.

1340
01:40:51.363 --> 01:40:54.825
Please indicate your vote
by a yes or no.

1341
01:40:54.908 --> 01:40:58.119
- Yes.
- Yes.

1342
01:40:58.203 --> 01:41:01.289
Yes.

1343
01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:08.671
- No.
- No.

1344
01:41:10.297 --> 01:41:12.758
Motion's passed.

1345
01:41:16.636 --> 01:41:20.056
We will, of course, delay the announcement
out of respect for our former chairman...

1346
01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:24.852
until after the celebration
of his birthday this weekend.

1347
01:41:24.894 --> 01:41:28.522
Well, thanks for allowing me
to save face, Drew.

1348
01:41:28.606 --> 01:41:31.525
The other motion before us is the
acceptance of John Bontecou's offer...

1349
01:41:31.567 --> 01:41:35.696
to merge this corporation
with Bontecou International.

1350
01:41:51.794 --> 01:41:55.005
Okay. Joe?

1351
01:42:05.765 --> 01:42:07.933
Who I am...

1352
01:42:07.975 --> 01:42:11.937
and what my relationship is
to William Parrish...

1353
01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:15.273
will be divulged
in our own good time.

1354
01:42:16.483 --> 01:42:20.904
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Black.

1355
01:42:25.575 --> 01:42:27.618
It's not over till it's over.

1356
01:42:27.702 --> 01:42:29.995
Please, Eddie,
no "fat lady sings" stuff.

1357
01:42:30.079 --> 01:42:34.458
I still sense some doubt in this group.
We could turn it around.

1358
01:42:34.499 --> 01:42:36.543
- You'll be up in the country?
- Yeah.

1359
01:42:36.626 --> 01:42:39.713
The big celebration of my mandatory
retirement birthday.

1360
01:42:39.796 --> 01:42:41.714
You're an honored guest, Eddie.

1361
01:42:41.798 --> 01:42:44.967
I'm gonna stick it out here.
We still have a shot.

1362
01:42:45.051 --> 01:42:48.637
Get John's office on the phone.
Tell them I'll be there in 20 minutes.

1363
01:42:50.598 --> 01:42:52.933
What did you do?

1364
01:42:53.016 --> 01:42:56.269
- You've gotten the old man fired.
- That we did.

1365
01:42:56.353 --> 01:42:58.772
Thanks to you.

1366
01:42:58.855 --> 01:43:02.066
He was wobbling, mind you,
but you supplied the coup de grâce.

1367
01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:04.610
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

1368
01:43:04.694 --> 01:43:07.863
Quince, you can't unscramble
scrambled eggs.

1369
01:43:07.947 --> 01:43:10.908
I... I didn't mean to do this.

1370
01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:13.702
Train's left the station, pal,
and you're aboard.

1371
01:43:15.037 --> 01:43:17.998
Now, would you like to hear
the silver lining?

1372
01:43:18.081 --> 01:43:20.750
Check that. Gold.

1373
01:43:23.461 --> 01:43:26.631
Once John Bontecou acquires
Parrish Communications,

1374
01:43:26.714 --> 01:43:31.593
he's gonna break it apart, peddle it
piece by piece to the highest bidder.

1375
01:43:32.761 --> 01:43:35.305
That was the game plan
right from the start.

1376
01:43:35.389 --> 01:43:37.766
I set it up for him, and he
smacks it out of the park.

1377
01:43:37.849 --> 01:43:41.186
Ramifications for you?

1378
01:43:41.269 --> 01:43:44.272
You'll be farting through silk.

1379
01:43:44.355 --> 01:43:49.443
You'll sell your stock.
You'll be positively, truly rich.

1380
01:43:49.527 --> 01:43:52.780
You can stop kissing ass.

1381
01:43:52.821 --> 01:43:55.615
What'll it feel like to be a man?

1382
01:43:57.659 --> 01:44:02.372
I'm going to expose you.

1383
01:44:02.455 --> 01:44:04.916
Okay. Go right ahead.

1384
01:44:04.999 --> 01:44:08.711
You tell William Parrish how you
betrayed him in a secret board meeting.

1385
01:44:08.794 --> 01:44:13.006
Tell Allison how you helped
her father lose his company.

1386
01:44:16.009 --> 01:44:19.137
It's just life, Quincie.

1387
01:44:19.179 --> 01:44:22.307
Wake up and smell the thorns.

1388
01:44:57.088 --> 01:44:59.549
You're here.

1389
01:44:59.632 --> 01:45:02.385
I am.

1390
01:45:03.553 --> 01:45:06.389
I, uh... just dropped by.

1391
01:45:06.472 --> 01:45:11.935
I thought I'd scrounge some lunch.
I was in the neighborhood.

1392
01:45:12.019 --> 01:45:14.062
I'm so glad.

1393
01:45:14.146 --> 01:45:19.192
When I called, they said that you
and Dad had already left the office.

1394
01:45:19.234 --> 01:45:22.445
Mm-hmm.
He's taking a nap.

1395
01:45:22.528 --> 01:45:26.407
Oh. Yeah.

1396
01:45:28.659 --> 01:45:33.413
Well, uh, he must be tired.

1397
01:45:33.497 --> 01:45:36.541
You know,
this whole Bontecou thing...

1398
01:45:36.625 --> 01:45:38.918
It, um, seems...

1399
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.589
Yes, he's tired.
I believe so.

1400
01:45:43.673 --> 01:45:45.591
Yeah.

1401
01:45:52.681 --> 01:45:55.392
You must be hungry then.

1402
01:45:57.602 --> 01:45:59.521
No.

1403
01:45:59.604 --> 01:46:02.023
Not anymore.

1404
01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:06.152
Are you?

1405
01:51:25.486 --> 01:51:28.447
I loved making love to you.

1406
01:51:29.949 --> 01:51:35.078
It was like
making love with someone...

1407
01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.415
making love
for the first time.

1408
01:51:41.459 --> 01:51:43.419
Thank you.

1409
01:51:47.631 --> 01:51:51.176
Do you like
making love with me?

1410
01:51:54.304 --> 01:51:56.681
Yes.

1411
01:51:57.724 --> 01:52:00.685
More than
you love peanut butter?

1412
01:52:00.768 --> 01:52:02.812
Yes.

1413
01:52:02.895 --> 01:52:05.398
Much more.

1414
01:52:17.284 --> 01:52:21.538
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. I'm here.

1415
01:52:22.705 --> 01:52:25.041
For how long?

1416
01:52:25.082 --> 01:52:28.085
I hope a long, long time.

1417
01:52:30.045 --> 01:52:32.381
Me too.

1418
01:52:39.512 --> 01:52:42.307
What do we do now?

1419
01:52:45.810 --> 01:52:47.895
Um...

1420
01:52:50.356 --> 01:52:53.901
it'll come to us.

1421
01:53:24.137 --> 01:53:29.099
Hello, Bill.
Did you have a nice nap?

1422
01:53:30.768 --> 01:53:35.355
- I couldn't sleep.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1423
01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:39.150
I'll come down.

1424
01:53:42.111 --> 01:53:45.740
What's going on?
Hmm?

1425
01:53:46.824 --> 01:53:48.993
I saw you kiss Susan.

1426
01:53:49.076 --> 01:53:51.620
Yes, I saw you see me.

1427
01:53:51.662 --> 01:53:54.039
You're at the wrong place at the
wrong time with the wrong woman.

1428
01:53:54.122 --> 01:53:56.750
- I'll be the judge of that.
- I'm her father.

1429
01:53:56.833 --> 01:53:59.502
With all due respect,
Bill, I'm not asking your permission.

1430
01:53:59.586 --> 01:54:03.673
You goddamn well should!

1431
01:54:12.681 --> 01:54:17.227
You walk into my life.
You give me the worst news a guy can get.

1432
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:20.021
You have me dancing on heads of
pins with my business, my family.

1433
01:54:20.105 --> 01:54:22.649
- Now you're spooning with my daughter?
- "Spooning"?

1434
01:54:22.732 --> 01:54:26.110
Yes! And stop repeating everything
I say and turning it into a question.

1435
01:54:26.193 --> 01:54:30.155
Spooning, fooling around
and God knows what.

1436
01:54:30.239 --> 01:54:32.783
Oh, you arrive on the scene...

1437
01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:36.286
Why you picked me
I still don't understand.

1438
01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:39.247
I chose you for your verve,
your excellence...

1439
01:54:39.289 --> 01:54:43.626
and your ability to...
instruct.

1440
01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:47.338
You've lived a first-rate life,
and I find it eminently usable.

1441
01:54:50.883 --> 01:54:53.135
What do you want?

1442
01:54:54.303 --> 01:54:56.263
Huh?

1443
01:54:57.889 --> 01:55:01.059
Everybody wants something, Joe.

1444
01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:04.103
You've been taking me
from pillar to post here.

1445
01:55:04.145 --> 01:55:06.606
And, uh,

1446
01:55:06.689 --> 01:55:10.943
I thought I knew who you were,
and it wasn't a lot of fun.

1447
01:55:11.026 --> 01:55:14.071
But it was almost bearable.

1448
01:55:14.154 --> 01:55:17.866
But now I'm getting something
else from you, something very...

1449
01:55:17.949 --> 01:55:20.368
very strange.

1450
01:55:20.452 --> 01:55:23.496
What is it that you want?

1451
01:55:23.579 --> 01:55:26.415
I'm only living
the Parrish bywords...

1452
01:55:26.457 --> 01:55:29.251
looking for that
"ounce of excitement,"

1453
01:55:29.293 --> 01:55:33.338
that "whisper of a thrill there is
no sense living your life without."

1454
01:55:34.506 --> 01:55:37.551
You know what I mean, Bill?

1455
01:55:39.135 --> 01:55:42.805
You're violating
the laws of the universe.

1456
01:55:42.889 --> 01:55:47.435
- This universe?
- Any universe that exists or ever existed.

1457
01:55:47.518 --> 01:55:52.523
You may be the pro, Joe,
but I know who you are,

1458
01:55:52.606 --> 01:55:55.067
and you're all fucked up.

1459
01:55:57.944 --> 01:56:01.447
I don't like your tone,
and I don't like your references.

1460
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:04.075
And I don't give a shit.

1461
01:56:04.158 --> 01:56:09.663
Perhaps it's time to remind you this is not
simply a dispute with a putative suitor.

1462
01:56:09.747 --> 01:56:13.667
This is me.
So be careful, Bill.

1463
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:17.254
Cut all that "Bill" crap out,
you son of a bitch.

1464
01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:21.549
I'll say it again.
Be careful, Bill.

1465
01:56:29.765 --> 01:56:33.393
Can I help you?
Excuse me, can I help you?

1466
01:56:33.477 --> 01:56:37.772
Yes. Dr. Parrish, please.

1467
01:56:37.856 --> 01:56:41.151
She comes on at 6:00.

1468
01:56:41.234 --> 01:56:43.152
Oh.

1469
01:56:52.494 --> 01:56:54.496
Hi.

1470
01:56:57.082 --> 01:57:00.585
- Where's Joe?
- Joe?

1471
01:57:02.503 --> 01:57:05.256
Joe's not around.

1472
01:57:06.465 --> 01:57:10.052
- Do you know where he is?
- I don't know.

1473
01:57:10.135 --> 01:57:12.096
Oh.

1474
01:57:13.472 --> 01:57:16.308
Why are you looking for Joe?

1475
01:57:16.349 --> 01:57:20.353
Love. Passion. Obsession.

1476
01:57:20.437 --> 01:57:23.648
All those things
you told me to wait for.

1477
01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:26.150
- They've arrived.
- This is crazy.

1478
01:57:28.986 --> 01:57:30.821
Why?

1479
01:57:30.904 --> 01:57:34.032
A man shows up,
almost never leaves your side.

1480
01:57:34.116 --> 01:57:38.703
Well, you clearly trust him,
depend on him.

1481
01:57:38.787 --> 01:57:42.540
So why aren't those things
good enough for me?

1482
01:57:42.624 --> 01:57:45.501
- You don't know anything about Joe.
- What are you afraid of?

1483
01:57:45.543 --> 01:57:49.129
That I'll fall
head over heels for Joe?

1484
01:57:50.381 --> 01:57:53.425
Well, I have.
Just like you did with Mom.

1485
01:57:53.508 --> 01:57:56.636
Isn't that what you've
always wanted for me?

1486
01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.638
Susan...

1487
01:58:01.015 --> 01:58:05.019
I don't think Joe is
gonna be with us long.

1488
01:58:05.061 --> 01:58:07.855
Where is he going?

1489
01:58:07.938 --> 01:58:10.357
I don't know.

1490
01:58:10.399 --> 01:58:13.360
- I can't say.
- Oh, come on.

1491
01:58:13.402 --> 01:58:18.156
The guy's working with you. You know chapter
and verse about everyone working with you.

1492
01:58:18.239 --> 01:58:21.201
In this case I can't. I...

1493
01:58:21.284 --> 01:58:26.831
I only will tell you that with Joe,
you're on... very, very dangerous ground.

1494
01:58:34.755 --> 01:58:36.715
I love him.

1495
01:58:36.756 --> 01:58:41.094
I don't care if you love him!
I'm telling you!

1496
01:58:51.895 --> 01:58:54.648
Joe's no good for you.

1497
01:58:56.775 --> 01:58:59.903
Of course not, Daddy.

1498
01:58:59.944 --> 01:59:01.905
I'm sorry.

1499
01:59:06.659 --> 01:59:09.411
I love you too.

1500
01:59:39.564 --> 01:59:44.235
Mr. Bad News.
'Bout time you show up.

1501
01:59:48.322 --> 01:59:51.200
Don't be feisty, sister.

1502
01:59:51.283 --> 01:59:53.702
I'm not feisty, mister.

1503
01:59:53.744 --> 01:59:57.289
You come for me?
That's good news.

1504
01:59:59.165 --> 02:00:01.918
No, I come to see the doctor.

1505
02:00:02.001 --> 02:00:04.837
- Doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

1506
02:00:04.879 --> 02:00:08.007
- What could be wrong with you?
- Nothin'.

1507
02:00:10.009 --> 02:00:13.971
Ohh. You come
to see doctor lady?

1508
02:00:14.054 --> 02:00:16.515
- Yeah, man.
- My doctor lady?

1509
02:00:18.558 --> 02:00:21.060
Mine too, you know.

1510
02:00:23.104 --> 02:00:26.190
You're in love?

1511
02:00:32.696 --> 02:00:35.657
You're loved back?

1512
02:00:42.538 --> 02:00:46.334
She know your real self?

1513
02:00:46.417 --> 02:00:49.753
- She know how she feel.
- Backside!

1514
02:00:49.837 --> 02:00:52.506
What the hell kind
of business this is.

1515
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:55.008
Don't need you okayin'.

1516
02:00:55.092 --> 02:00:59.512
Schoolboy things in your head.
Badness for you.

1517
02:00:59.596 --> 02:01:01.973
Badness for her.

1518
02:01:02.015 --> 02:01:05.309
Badness for me, lyin' here,

1519
02:01:05.393 --> 02:01:07.520
tumor big as a breadfruit,

1520
02:01:07.603 --> 02:01:12.232
poisonin' me inside,
and waitin'.

1521
02:01:12.316 --> 02:01:15.944
Bring you flowers,
and all I's gettin' is aggravation.

1522
02:01:16.027 --> 02:01:19.197
The only flowers
I want to see...

1523
02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.993
is the ones over my peaceful
self resting in the dirt.

1524
02:01:24.077 --> 02:01:27.329
Can't do no right by people.
Come to take you, you want to stay.

1525
02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:30.749
Leave you stay, you want to go.
Rahtid.

1526
02:01:33.502 --> 02:01:38.131
You're not in
your right place, mister.

1527
02:01:38.214 --> 02:01:40.592
Me neither.

1528
02:01:40.675 --> 02:01:42.677
No more.

1529
02:01:42.719 --> 02:01:45.555
Take me, and you come
with me now.

1530
02:01:56.523 --> 02:01:59.651
But I not lonely here.

1531
02:02:01.819 --> 02:02:04.614
Somebody want me here.

1532
02:02:06.449 --> 02:02:08.576
Hmm.

1533
02:02:08.659 --> 02:02:12.412
It nice it happen to you.

1534
02:02:12.496 --> 02:02:16.249
Like you come to the island
and had a holiday.

1535
02:02:18.209 --> 02:02:22.797
Sun didn't burn you red-red,
just brown.

1536
02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.885
You sleep,
and no mosquito eat you.

1537
02:02:27.968 --> 02:02:32.264
But the truth is,
it bound to happen...

1538
02:02:32.306 --> 02:02:35.142
if you stay long enough.

1539
02:02:36.893 --> 02:02:41.522
So take that nice picture
you got in your head home with you,

1540
02:02:42.982 --> 02:02:46.110
but don't be fooled.

1541
02:02:50.281 --> 02:02:53.575
We lonely here mostly too.

1542
02:02:55.452 --> 02:02:58.371
If we lucky, maybe...

1543
02:02:59.998 --> 02:03:04.085
we got some nice pictures
to take with us.

1544
02:03:28.190 --> 02:03:31.110
You got enough nice pictures?

1545
02:03:35.364 --> 02:03:37.282
Yes.

1546
02:04:31.832 --> 02:04:34.459
Good-bye, sister.

1547
02:04:58.023 --> 02:05:00.483
Yes?

1548
02:05:00.567 --> 02:05:04.445
I have the feeling, all in all,

1549
02:05:04.529 --> 02:05:09.200
what I made this voyage for
has served its purpose.

1550
02:05:11.744 --> 02:05:15.914
What are you saying?
It's time to go?

1551
02:05:22.795 --> 02:05:25.131
I'm ready.

1552
02:05:25.214 --> 02:05:27.550
You are?

1553
02:05:29.009 --> 02:05:31.095
Yeah.

1554
02:05:33.639 --> 02:05:38.768
Good. Tomorrow.
After the party.

1555
02:06:09.672 --> 02:06:11.757
- Yes, Helen?
- Telephone call, sir.

1556
02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:14.509
- Mr. Sloane from New York.
- Thank you.

1557
02:06:14.593 --> 02:06:16.511
Excuse me.

1558
02:06:27.396 --> 02:06:29.440
Thank you.

1559
02:06:33.610 --> 02:06:35.529
Hey!

1560
02:06:36.613 --> 02:06:38.531
Hey.

1561
02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:43.161
Red or white?

1562
02:06:43.244 --> 02:06:45.663
- No. No, thank you.
- Have a drink.

1563
02:06:45.746 --> 02:06:49.166
- You look like you need one as bad as me.
- I do?

1564
02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:56.298
- Quince?
- Mm-hmm.

1565
02:06:56.339 --> 02:06:58.967
I find myself a little confused.

1566
02:07:02.762 --> 02:07:05.181
- Confused, huh?
- Yes.

1567
02:07:05.264 --> 02:07:07.266
- About what?
- Love.

1568
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:09.977
Love.

1569
02:07:10.019 --> 02:07:13.689
Oh, man.
I got problems of my own.

1570
02:07:16.942 --> 02:07:20.987
- You love Allison, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

1571
02:07:21.070 --> 02:07:23.031
How did you meet?

1572
02:07:24.532 --> 02:07:26.867
Well, um,

1573
02:07:26.951 --> 02:07:31.038
I was this world-class loser,
and she was this happy little rich girl,

1574
02:07:31.121 --> 02:07:34.333
and for some reason
she took me in.

1575
02:07:36.251 --> 02:07:38.962
But Allison loves you.

1576
02:07:49.638 --> 02:07:51.974
How do you know?

1577
02:07:57.062 --> 02:08:00.815
Because she knows the
worst thing about me, and it's okay.

1578
02:08:00.899 --> 02:08:02.894
What is it?

1579
02:08:02.895 --> 02:08:05.277
No, it's not one thing.
It's just an idea, Joe.

1580
02:08:05.278 --> 02:08:08.155
It's just, um, um...

1581
02:08:09.657 --> 02:08:13.911
It's like you know
each other's secrets,

1582
02:08:14.995 --> 02:08:18.999
your deepest,
darkest secrets.

1583
02:08:19.082 --> 02:08:23.961
- Deepest, darkest secrets?
- Yeah, and then you... you're free.

1584
02:08:24.003 --> 02:08:26.005
Free?

1585
02:08:27.173 --> 02:08:30.134
You're free!
You're free to I...

1586
02:08:30.217 --> 02:08:32.845
love each other
completely, totally.

1587
02:08:32.928 --> 02:08:36.473
Just no fear.

1588
02:08:36.598 --> 02:08:40.351
So there's nothing you don't know
about each other, and it's okay.

1589
02:08:43.062 --> 02:08:45.022
Hmm.

1590
02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:55.502
Do you like me, Joe?

1591
02:08:55.803 --> 02:08:59.903
Oh, yes, Quince.
You're one of my favorites.

1592
02:09:04.707 --> 02:09:10.045
What would you say if you knew it was
me who brought down Bill Parrish?

1593
02:09:13.298 --> 02:09:17.302
Oh, I told Drew and the board
that Bill depended on you.

1594
02:09:17.385 --> 02:09:20.180
Drew and Bontecou are gonna chop up
the company, sell it off for parts.

1595
02:09:20.263 --> 02:09:22.181
Bontecou was outside.
Drew was Mr. Inside.

1596
02:09:22.265 --> 02:09:27.311
And I was the fool
who made it all happen.

1597
02:09:30.439 --> 02:09:32.399
Ohh...

1598
02:09:33.442 --> 02:09:35.402
God.

1599
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:45.494
What do I do?

1600
02:09:45.578 --> 02:09:48.706
Go to Bill Parrish
and tell him the truth.

1601
02:09:48.789 --> 02:09:51.208
He'll forgive you.

1602
02:09:53.418 --> 02:09:56.463
- You think so?
- Yes.

1603
02:09:59.424 --> 02:10:02.468
You think I should wait
till after the party?

1604
02:10:02.552 --> 02:10:04.470
No.

1605
02:10:07.473 --> 02:10:09.892
No.

1606
02:10:09.975 --> 02:10:13.562
Four down here
and a sturgeon up there.

1607
02:10:13.645 --> 02:10:16.439
This one is perfect.
Absolutely.

1608
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:20.110
Okay, I think
I want four here like that...

1609
02:10:20.193 --> 02:10:22.654
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

1610
02:10:22.737 --> 02:10:25.364
What do you think?

1611
02:10:25.448 --> 02:10:29.076
Well, it's, uh...
it's starting to grow on me.

1612
02:10:29.159 --> 02:10:32.412
Oh, I've got a baritone
with a balalaika...

1613
02:10:32.496 --> 02:10:35.082
coming from
the Russian Tea Room.

1614
02:10:35.165 --> 02:10:39.252
I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt,
and he'll be singing Nelson Eddy songs.

1615
02:10:39.335 --> 02:10:41.254
Wow.

1616
02:10:43.172 --> 02:10:45.508
You really are amazing.

1617
02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:49.887
But why, oh, why, Allison,
are you doing all this?

1618
02:10:53.473 --> 02:10:58.144
I do it because I love you.
Everybody loves you:

1619
02:10:58.228 --> 02:11:02.440
Mommy, wherever she is,
Susan, Quince...

1620
02:11:03.816 --> 02:11:08.279
all the people you work with,
anyone who's ever met you.

1621
02:11:09.488 --> 02:11:11.740
Ohh, Daddy.

1622
02:11:11.824 --> 02:11:15.952
After all, you've been
a wonderful father.

1623
02:11:18.246 --> 02:11:20.623
Yeah, well,

1624
02:11:20.707 --> 02:11:22.875
I haven't been the father
to you that, uh...

1625
02:11:22.917 --> 02:11:25.628
- That you've been to Susan?
- I wasn't going to say that.

1626
02:11:25.711 --> 02:11:29.506
But that's what you were thinking.
And that's okay.

1627
02:11:29.590 --> 02:11:31.759
Because I know
that you love me.

1628
02:11:31.842 --> 02:11:35.095
I mean, it's not
like it is with her.

1629
02:11:35.178 --> 02:11:38.890
Whenever she walks into the room,
your eyes light up.

1630
02:11:38.973 --> 02:11:42.226
She always gets a smile
from you, as opposed to me.

1631
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:45.146
When I walk in,

1632
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:49.233
this look comes over your face, like,
"What does she want now?"

1633
02:11:49.316 --> 02:11:53.028
But you've never let
either of us want for anything.

1634
02:11:53.111 --> 02:11:56.948
Oh, God. More than that,
Daddy, more than that.

1635
02:12:01.869 --> 02:12:06.040
I've felt loved,
and that's all that matters.

1636
02:12:06.123 --> 02:12:09.627
So, never mind favorites.

1637
02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:11.628
You're allowed to have one.

1638
02:12:11.712 --> 02:12:15.007
The point is, you've been mine.

1639
02:12:17.759 --> 02:12:19.677
Oh, Allison.

1640
02:12:21.429 --> 02:12:23.347
Oh.

1641
02:12:26.851 --> 02:12:28.853
I really feel...

1642
02:12:30.562 --> 02:12:33.523
I've everything I could've ever
wanted for my birthday.

1643
02:12:33.607 --> 02:12:36.568
Oh, wait a minute!

1644
02:12:36.651 --> 02:12:40.989
There's more to come.
Lots of excess, like you love.

1645
02:12:43.366 --> 02:12:47.995
You know, this is gonna be
a wonderful party.

1646
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:51.707
Yes, it is.

1647
02:12:55.419 --> 02:12:58.380
Thank you. Thank you.

1648
02:13:00.882 --> 02:13:04.343
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks.

1649
02:13:29.575 --> 02:13:31.452
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1650
02:13:31.493 --> 02:13:34.246
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

1651
02:13:39.250 --> 02:13:41.252
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1652
02:13:41.336 --> 02:13:44.130
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Simone. How are you?

1653
02:13:49.218 --> 02:13:52.679
- Hi, darling.
- Oh, hi, Gene. Hi.

1654
02:14:19.788 --> 02:14:22.999
My father told me
you might be leaving.

1655
02:14:24.083 --> 02:14:26.711
Your father and I...

1656
02:14:26.794 --> 02:14:31.173
Our time together
has come to an end.

1657
02:14:40.890 --> 02:14:44.727
I'm in love...
with a man,

1658
02:14:46.145 --> 02:14:48.898
but I don't know
who he is,

1659
02:14:48.981 --> 02:14:51.442
where he's going
or when.

1660
02:14:54.403 --> 02:14:56.613
I can tell you
the when part.

1661
02:14:58.073 --> 02:15:00.241
Tonight.

1662
02:15:02.952 --> 02:15:05.538
So it does get worse.

1663
02:15:05.621 --> 02:15:08.457
No worse
than it gets for me.

1664
02:15:13.545 --> 02:15:16.631
I'm in love
with a woman who...

1665
02:15:19.426 --> 02:15:21.753
I don't wanna leave.

1666
02:15:22.595 --> 02:15:24.555
I don't wanna leave.

1667
02:15:26.307 --> 02:15:28.476
Ohh.

1668
02:15:28.559 --> 02:15:30.561
Then don't.

1669
02:15:34.314 --> 02:15:37.901
There's so little
we know about each other.

1670
02:15:37.943 --> 02:15:40.195
There's so much
I should tell you.

1671
02:15:40.278 --> 02:15:43.906
That'll come.
That'll come.

1672
02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:51.622
- Will it?
- Mm-hmm.

1673
02:15:54.916 --> 02:15:57.544
I wanna be with you, Joe.

1674
02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:09.221
I opened my big mouth
one too many times.

1675
02:16:09.305 --> 02:16:12.474
Everything just got
all, uh, twisted.

1676
02:16:12.516 --> 02:16:15.018
It's okay, Quince.
I understand.

1677
02:16:15.102 --> 02:16:18.229
You've always meant well,
and I appreciate that.

1678
02:16:18.313 --> 02:16:21.816
Sometimes things
just turn out wrong.

1679
02:16:21.899 --> 02:16:23.860
Yeah?

1680
02:16:25.695 --> 02:16:28.072
- Excuse me.
- No, no... Uh, Joe, come in.

1681
02:16:28.155 --> 02:16:30.658
Um, I wanna thank you.
Is it okay, Bill?

1682
02:16:30.741 --> 02:16:34.286
- Sure.
- Joe knows the whole story. I told him.

1683
02:16:34.369 --> 02:16:38.039
And it was his idea that I come clean.
I mean...

1684
02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:40.542
I wanted to come clean,
but, uh,

1685
02:16:40.583 --> 02:16:43.920
he gave me a pair of balls,
you know what I mean?

1686
02:16:44.003 --> 02:16:46.672
Yeah, I believe I do.

1687
02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:54.554
Anyway, uh,

1688
02:16:54.638 --> 02:16:57.307
I can see you guys
got business.

1689
02:16:57.390 --> 02:17:01.978
No. However, I do have
some unfinished business with Drew.

1690
02:17:02.103 --> 02:17:04.647
Get him on the helicopter.
Get him out here tonight.

1691
02:17:04.689 --> 02:17:07.608
I wanna tell this guy how I feel
about him face-to-face.

1692
02:17:07.691 --> 02:17:12.946
That could be a tall order, B.P. I doubt if
Drew is anxious to see you face-to-face.

1693
02:17:18.952 --> 02:17:21.955
- I'll deliver the package.
- Okay.

1694
02:17:34.132 --> 02:17:37.552
- How are you doing?
- What the hell do you care?

1695
02:17:37.636 --> 02:17:40.388
Just asking, Bill.

1696
02:17:42.849 --> 02:17:45.601
You wanna know?
I'll tell you.

1697
02:17:45.685 --> 02:17:49.104
You're looking at a man who is not walking
through the valley of the shadow of death.

1698
02:17:49.188 --> 02:17:51.774
He's galloping into it.
At the same time, the business he built...

1699
02:17:51.857 --> 02:17:55.402
with his own hands and head has been
commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.

1700
02:17:55.485 --> 02:17:59.322
Oh, yes! I almost forgot.
My daughter's fallen in love with Death.

1701
02:17:59.364 --> 02:18:02.325
And I'm in love
with your daughter.

1702
02:18:04.368 --> 02:18:06.329
Say again?

1703
02:18:10.457 --> 02:18:14.419
I'm in love with your daughter,
and I'm taking her with me tonight.

1704
02:18:15.587 --> 02:18:19.090
- You what?
- I think you heard me, Bill.

1705
02:18:19.174 --> 02:18:22.635
You're not taking Susan anywhere.
What does that mean, anyway? We had a deal.

1706
02:18:22.719 --> 02:18:25.471
And I'm sorry.

1707
02:18:27.848 --> 02:18:31.101
Susan's my daughter.
She has a wonderful life ahead of her.

1708
02:18:31.185 --> 02:18:34.313
You're gonna deprive her of it,
and you're telling me you're sorry?

1709
02:18:34.396 --> 02:18:36.648
I'm sorry.
Apology not accepted.

1710
02:18:36.731 --> 02:18:40.443
I don't care, Bill.
I love her.

1711
02:18:41.903 --> 02:18:44.405
How perfect for you...

1712
02:18:44.447 --> 02:18:48.075
to take whatever you want
because it pleases you.

1713
02:18:48.159 --> 02:18:50.452
That's not love.

1714
02:18:50.536 --> 02:18:52.663
Then what is it?

1715
02:18:52.746 --> 02:18:57.292
Some aimless infatuation which,
for the moment, you feel like indulging.

1716
02:18:57.375 --> 02:18:59.919
It's missing everything
that matters.

1717
02:19:00.003 --> 02:19:01.838
Which is what?

1718
02:19:01.921 --> 02:19:04.549
Trust, responsibility,

1719
02:19:04.632 --> 02:19:06.592
taking the weight for
your choices and feelings...

1720
02:19:06.634 --> 02:19:09.220
and spending the rest
of your life living up to them,

1721
02:19:09.303 --> 02:19:13.056
and above all,
not hurting the object of your love.

1722
02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:15.350
So that's love according
to William Parrish?

1723
02:19:15.434 --> 02:19:18.478
Multiply it by infinity
and take it to the depth of forever,

1724
02:19:18.561 --> 02:19:22.231
and you will still have barely a glimpse
of what I'm talking about.

1725
02:19:22.315 --> 02:19:26.027
Those were my words.
They're mine now.

1726
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:31.407
Bill, Susan wants to come with me.
She loves me.

1727
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:33.492
- She loves you?
- Mm-hmm.

1728
02:19:33.575 --> 02:19:35.994
Who is you?
Did you tell her who you are?

1729
02:19:36.077 --> 02:19:40.415
- No.
- Does she know where she's going? Huh?

1730
02:19:42.166 --> 02:19:45.169
You see, Susan went for
that poor son of a bitch...

1731
02:19:45.211 --> 02:19:48.339
whose body you took, and everything
since has been aftermath.

1732
02:19:48.422 --> 02:19:50.382
You don't know what love is.

1733
02:19:50.466 --> 02:19:52.384
She doesn't know who you are.

1734
02:19:52.468 --> 02:19:56.721
You make a deal; you're breaking it.
Bottom line is, Joe,

1735
02:19:56.805 --> 02:19:59.474
you're swindling her soul, and you're
doing it with your eyes wide open.

1736
02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:03.019
- I don't like what you're saying.
- I'm past caring what you like and don't.

1737
02:20:03.102 --> 02:20:05.613
You're stealing my daughter,
and I'm not gonna let you.

1738
02:20:05.614 --> 02:20:06.314
You're not?

1739
02:20:06.315 --> 02:20:08.023
- No.
- Are you threatening me?

1740
02:20:08.107 --> 02:20:10.901
Yeah, I certainly hope so.

1741
02:20:10.984 --> 02:20:12.903
Yeah.

1742
02:20:15.197 --> 02:20:18.159
I loved Susan from
the moment she was born,

1743
02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:20.160
and I love her now and
every minute in between.

1744
02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:22.546
And what I dream of
is a man who will

1745
02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:24.225
discover her, and that
she will discover a man...

1746
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:27.792
who will love her, who is worthy of her,
who is of this world, this time...

1747
02:20:27.875 --> 02:20:30.127
and has the grace, compassion
and fortitude to walk beside her...

1748
02:20:30.210 --> 02:20:32.129
as she makes her way
through life.

1749
02:20:32.212 --> 02:20:34.131
Enough!

1750
02:20:36.424 --> 02:20:39.803
What I know is what I want,
and what I want is Susan.

1751
02:20:39.886 --> 02:20:42.013
And I will have her,
and she will have me.

1752
02:20:42.096 --> 02:20:46.892
And that's the way it's going to be.
And there's nothing you can do.

1753
02:20:49.311 --> 02:20:51.855
Why did you
tell me all this, Joe?

1754
02:20:51.897 --> 02:20:53.982
You're the big shot,
the biggest shot of all.

1755
02:20:54.066 --> 02:20:58.028
You don't have to ask permission, but that's
what you're doing. Do you know why?

1756
02:20:58.111 --> 02:21:02.156
Because you've somehow developed into
a good guy, and you know this is all wrong.

1757
02:21:03.408 --> 02:21:06.285
I don't know what
you're gonna do, but, uh,

1758
02:21:06.369 --> 02:21:08.412
how can this be love?

1759
02:21:08.496 --> 02:21:11.248
She doesn't know who you are.

1760
02:21:11.331 --> 02:21:15.627
Why don't you tell her,
try it out, see what happens?

1761
02:21:15.628 --> 02:21:17.865
Reveal everything there
is to know about yourself

1762
02:21:17.866 --> 02:21:20.200
and let the chips fall where they may.

1763
02:21:24.135 --> 02:21:26.470
Okay?

1764
02:21:29.723 --> 02:21:33.435
I've given it my best shot.
I, uh...

1765
02:21:33.518 --> 02:21:37.480
I wish I could tell you
to sleep on it.

1766
02:21:58.041 --> 02:22:00.960
Oh, um...

1767
02:22:01.044 --> 02:22:03.504
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me?

1768
02:22:03.588 --> 02:22:05.715
- Sure.
- Okay, nice to see you.

1769
02:22:05.798 --> 02:22:08.175
Nice to see you.

1770
02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:26.233
There's something
so indescribably sexy...

1771
02:22:26.317 --> 02:22:28.736
about you standing
in the middle of a crowd.

1772
02:22:28.819 --> 02:22:32.739
I could make love to you
right here.

1773
02:22:44.333 --> 02:22:49.630
You're trying to tell me my future,
you're looking on the wrong side.

1774
02:22:53.634 --> 02:22:57.095
There is something
I do want to tell you.

1775
02:23:04.310 --> 02:23:06.270
But you can't?

1776
02:23:13.569 --> 02:23:17.113
Just now when you hesitated,
I got a chill.

1777
02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:22.076
Remember that morning
in the coffee shop?

1778
02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:27.456
When you said, "What's wrong
with taking care of a woman?"

1779
02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:29.625
"She takes care of you."

1780
02:23:32.336 --> 02:23:34.838
- Did I say that?
- Mm-hmm.

1781
02:23:34.921 --> 02:23:40.176
And I said you'd have a hard time finding
a woman like that these days.

1782
02:23:43.805 --> 02:23:45.973
Well, you found one, Joe.

1783
02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:49.935
The coffee shop.

1784
02:23:51.395 --> 02:23:56.483
That was the place,
and you were the guy.

1785
02:23:59.027 --> 02:24:01.988
And you said that, uh,

1786
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:04.949
that you didn't want me
to be your doctor because...

1787
02:24:05.032 --> 02:24:09.912
you didn't want me
to examine you.

1788
02:24:09.995 --> 02:24:13.373
Why, I got to examine you,
after all.

1789
02:24:22.882 --> 02:24:25.301
I could come with you.

1790
02:24:29.138 --> 02:24:31.223
You want me to wait?

1791
02:24:31.306 --> 02:24:34.059
You'll come back?

1792
02:24:41.649 --> 02:24:44.318
May I kiss you?

1793
02:25:10.801 --> 02:25:13.720
That felt like good-bye.

1794
02:25:19.142 --> 02:25:22.353
What's going on, Joe?

1795
02:25:22.437 --> 02:25:25.439
I feel like we're lifting off.

1796
02:25:29.318 --> 02:25:31.320
I'm still here.

1797
02:25:36.658 --> 02:25:39.160
But you're not.

1798
02:25:41.204 --> 02:25:43.414
You're somewhere else.

1799
02:26:20.448 --> 02:26:22.533
You're someone else.

1800
02:26:27.121 --> 02:26:30.165
Don't you want to ask who?

1801
02:26:31.458 --> 02:26:34.252
- Yes, but...
- "But"?

1802
02:26:42.135 --> 02:26:44.428
Joe, I'm afraid.

1803
02:26:45.471 --> 02:26:47.556
Afraid to find out?

1804
02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:50.601
Don't be.

1805
02:26:51.643 --> 02:26:55.856
It doesn't matter what I am.

1806
02:26:55.939 --> 02:26:58.942
You know who I am.

1807
02:27:07.908 --> 02:27:09.827
You're...

1808
02:27:19.878 --> 02:27:22.547
You're...

1809
02:27:42.357 --> 02:27:44.609
You're Joe.

1810
02:27:51.281 --> 02:27:55.035
Yes, I'm Joe.

1811
02:28:00.206 --> 02:28:03.000
Oh.

1812
02:28:03.084 --> 02:28:05.461
And I promise you...

1813
02:28:08.464 --> 02:28:13.719
you will always have what you
found in the coffee shop.

1814
02:28:21.017 --> 02:28:25.062
Tell me that you love me.
Tell me that you love me now.

1815
02:28:26.147 --> 02:28:29.108
I love you now.

1816
02:28:29.149 --> 02:28:31.652
I'll love you always.

1817
02:28:36.698 --> 02:28:38.992
Susan.

1818
02:28:40.577 --> 02:28:42.662
Yes?

1819
02:28:44.622 --> 02:28:47.166
Thank you for loving me.

1820
02:29:16.776 --> 02:29:20.405
We should think about
getting started, Bill.

1821
02:29:23.032 --> 02:29:24.992
Mm-hmm.

1822
02:29:31.373 --> 02:29:34.042
It'll just be us.

1823
02:29:37.879 --> 02:29:39.839
Thank you.

1824
02:29:46.262 --> 02:29:48.389
Bill?

1825
02:29:50.265 --> 02:29:52.893
Come in.

1826
02:29:54.478 --> 02:29:57.981
I got him. The helicopter
will be here in two minutes.

1827
02:29:58.064 --> 02:30:00.942
How are we on time?

1828
02:30:01.025 --> 02:30:03.569
Okay.

1829
02:30:03.653 --> 02:30:05.404
Get him in here.

1830
02:30:05.446 --> 02:30:08.908
May?

1831
02:30:08.949 --> 02:30:11.076
- Yes, sir?
- I know you're busy,

1832
02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:13.453
but I want you to put in a call
to Eddie Sloane for me.

1833
02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:16.164
- At home, sir?
- No, he's at the office.

1834
02:30:16.456 --> 02:30:19.584
This is damn big of Bill.

1835
02:30:19.626 --> 02:30:21.669
- Ooh. You all right?
- Yeah.

1836
02:30:21.753 --> 02:30:23.838
Also smart, you know?

1837
02:30:23.921 --> 02:30:27.591
Well, he had no choice.
He knows you're a formidable adversary.

1838
02:30:27.633 --> 02:30:28.831
He said that?

1839
02:30:28.832 --> 02:30:31.032
Yeah, I mean,
you got him by the short hairs.

1840
02:30:31.095 --> 02:30:33.096
Yeah, the short and gray hairs.

1841
02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:36.016
- We're all here, Bill.
- I appreciate this, Eddie.

1842
02:30:36.099 --> 02:30:41.104
Members of the board, this will
just take a minute of your time.

1843
02:30:41.187 --> 02:30:45.858
As custodians of the company, you may
receive information from what follows...

1844
02:30:45.942 --> 02:30:50.529
that will be valuable
to you or not.

1845
02:30:50.612 --> 02:30:53.115
- Either way, thanks.
- We're all ears.

1846
02:30:53.156 --> 02:30:54.616
Thanks.

1847
02:30:57.327 --> 02:30:59.287
Good evening, Bill.

1848
02:30:59.329 --> 02:31:01.664
Thank you, Quince.

1849
02:31:01.706 --> 02:31:07.211
I just wanted to say how appreciative
I am of this, um, grand gesture.

1850
02:31:07.294 --> 02:31:09.046
Shut up and sit down.

1851
02:31:15.135 --> 02:31:17.554
You're a useless sack
of shit, Drew.

1852
02:31:17.637 --> 02:31:19.639
You played footsie
with John Bontecou...

1853
02:31:19.722 --> 02:31:22.183
so you could dismember my company
to line your own pockets.

1854
02:31:22.225 --> 02:31:25.311
I don't know where you get
that idea. The board agreed...

1855
02:31:25.394 --> 02:31:29.481
The board didn't know you were a mole who
burrowed inside so you could bury us all.

1856
02:31:29.565 --> 02:31:32.860
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?
Another one of his whoppers?

1857
02:31:32.901 --> 02:31:36.112
Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking
around? Nobody knows who he is.

1858
02:31:36.196 --> 02:31:38.156
But one thing
everybody does know,

1859
02:31:38.239 --> 02:31:41.868
he somehow got your ear and has
been pouring poison into it ever since.

1860
02:31:41.909 --> 02:31:45.121
You're the poison, Drew.

1861
02:31:45.204 --> 02:31:48.082
You've operated behind the scenes
to suborn the trust of a man...

1862
02:31:48.165 --> 02:31:51.919
who has stamped you with his imprimatur
of class, elegance and stature.

1863
02:31:52.002 --> 02:31:56.673
I've had the opportunity to be witness
to every kind and degree of deception.

1864
02:31:56.756 --> 02:32:00.385
But Bill Parrish has been on the receiving
end of machinations so Machiavellian...

1865
02:32:00.426 --> 02:32:02.720
that it has rarely been
my experience to encounter.

1866
02:32:02.762 --> 02:32:08.392
And yet, he has combated them stoically and
selflessly, without revealing my identity.

1867
02:32:08.434 --> 02:32:11.562
Had he violated
the vow of secrecy he took,

1868
02:32:11.603 --> 02:32:14.189
his task would
have been far easier.

1869
02:32:14.272 --> 02:32:17.192
He could have turned
defeat into victory.

1870
02:32:17.275 --> 02:32:20.195
But he is too honorable a man
to have done that.

1871
02:32:20.278 --> 02:32:25.616
Because of me, he has lost his work,
his company, his reputation.

1872
02:32:25.658 --> 02:32:29.662
So now,
given these losses,

1873
02:32:29.745 --> 02:32:34.207
I'm compelled to end
the need for secrecy.

1874
02:32:35.792 --> 02:32:38.378
The time has come
to tell you who I am.

1875
02:32:44.008 --> 02:32:46.969
So tell me. Tell me.
I'm peeing in my pants.

1876
02:32:47.053 --> 02:32:49.930
- And you're going to pee some more.
- Joe, don't do this.

1877
02:32:50.014 --> 02:32:52.641
It's okay, Bill. It's time
we put this person in his place.

1878
02:32:52.724 --> 02:32:55.477
It's not necessary, Joe.
Drew's gonna step aside.

1879
02:32:55.519 --> 02:32:58.605
- I'm not stepping anywhere.
- I appreciate your gentlemanliness.

1880
02:32:58.688 --> 02:33:00.815
But what we need to do here
is drive the dagger home.

1881
02:33:00.899 --> 02:33:03.276
- "The dagger"?
- I told you to shut up!

1882
02:33:03.359 --> 02:33:05.820
Prepare yourself, Drew.

1883
02:33:05.903 --> 02:33:08.447
- I...
- Joe, please.

1884
02:33:08.531 --> 02:33:10.324
Kindly let me
take it from here.

1885
02:33:10.407 --> 02:33:12.159
- Am...
- Don't.

1886
02:33:16.997 --> 02:33:20.166
An agent for the
Internal Revenue Service.

1887
02:33:27.923 --> 02:33:28.924
- Bill?
- Huh?

1888
02:33:29.008 --> 02:33:30.676
Bill.

1889
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:35.889
- Bill.
- Yeah.

1890
02:33:35.931 --> 02:33:39.601
Yes, he's, um...

1891
02:33:39.684 --> 02:33:42.895
He's an agent for the
Internal Revenue Service.

1892
02:33:42.979 --> 02:33:45.856
Mmm, yes, we were convinced
that Bontecou, on past deals,

1893
02:33:45.898 --> 02:33:47.900
has structured his mergers
and acquisitions...

1894
02:33:47.983 --> 02:33:52.237
in suspicious and complicated ways so as
to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.

1895
02:33:52.238 --> 02:33:57.242
The agency asked Bill for his cooperation in
an undercover investigation of Bontecou.

1896
02:33:57.325 --> 02:34:03.247
We wanted to go after him, and this deal
gave us that perfect opportunity.

1897
02:34:03.289 --> 02:34:07.751
- And I offered to cooperate.
- And we're very grateful.

1898
02:34:07.793 --> 02:34:12.422
Uh, Agent Joe Black here...
Of course, that's not his real name...

1899
02:34:12.506 --> 02:34:14.508
smelled out
your involvement, Drew.

1900
02:34:14.591 --> 02:34:18.720
He developed evidence you were
working both sides of the fence.

1901
02:34:18.803 --> 02:34:23.141
Unfortunately, that is what is
known as a conflict of interest.

1902
02:34:23.182 --> 02:34:25.184
Undisclosed conflict of interest.

1903
02:34:25.268 --> 02:34:27.478
- An offense.
- An indictable offense.

1904
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:30.856
- And a likely conviction.
- Very likely.

1905
02:34:30.939 --> 02:34:33.859
I think I'd like
to talk to my lawyer.

1906
02:34:33.942 --> 02:34:38.446
No lawyers, Drew.
Uh, we're gonna offer you a deal.

1907
02:34:38.530 --> 02:34:42.158
Confess to the board every detail of your
participation, then submit your resignation.

1908
02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:43.868
What do I get?

1909
02:34:43.951 --> 02:34:45.620
You get not to go to jail.

1910
02:34:45.703 --> 02:34:47.788
You're talking
through your hat.

1911
02:34:47.872 --> 02:34:50.374
You're offering me a deal
because you've got no proof.

1912
02:34:50.457 --> 02:34:54.544
Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
He's talking through his lips.

1913
02:34:54.628 --> 02:34:58.673
Drew, make no mistake. Should you
choose to test my resolve in this matter,

1914
02:34:58.715 --> 02:35:01.509
you will be looking at an outcome
that will have a finality...

1915
02:35:01.551 --> 02:35:03.845
that is beyond
your comprehension.

1916
02:35:03.928 --> 02:35:07.890
And you will not be counting
the days or the months or the years,

1917
02:35:07.973 --> 02:35:11.268
but millenniums
in a place with no doors.

1918
02:35:14.229 --> 02:35:16.648
All right, you win.

1919
02:35:16.731 --> 02:35:19.067
Soon as I get back to the city,
I'll meet with the board.

1920
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:22.278
You're meeting with the board
right now, Drew. Resignation accepted.

1921
02:35:22.362 --> 02:35:26.657
Moreover, I propose a motion
to reconfirm William Parrish...

1922
02:35:26.741 --> 02:35:29.827
as chairman of the board
of Parrish Communications,

1923
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:33.622
as well as a rejection of the merger
with Bontecou International.

1924
02:35:33.705 --> 02:35:37.042
- How say you, board?
- Yes.

1925
02:35:37.083 --> 02:35:39.419
- Yes.
- The motion is passed.

1926
02:35:39.461 --> 02:35:41.588
Thank you. That's great.

1927
02:35:41.671 --> 02:35:45.466
But it's more than I bargained for.
I just wanted to set the record straight.

1928
02:35:45.549 --> 02:35:49.762
You have. Sounds like these guys want you
back, Bill. We'll get their apologies later.

1929
02:35:49.845 --> 02:35:53.724
Meanwhile, enjoy your party. Celebrate.
I'll attend to the nasty details.

1930
02:35:53.765 --> 02:35:56.268
And, Mr. Black,
may we say thank you?

1931
02:35:56.351 --> 02:35:59.437
My pleasure.
This is an I.R.S. Agent's dream.

1932
02:35:59.521 --> 02:36:01.689
I'll be promoted
chief of section off this.

1933
02:36:08.404 --> 02:36:11.448
Who would have believed it?

1934
02:36:11.532 --> 02:36:13.700
You an I.R.S. Agent?

1935
02:36:16.328 --> 02:36:19.414
Death and taxes.

1936
02:36:27.588 --> 02:36:31.133
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1937
02:36:31.216 --> 02:36:34.553

Speech! Speech! Speech!

1942
02:37:36.151 --> 02:37:38.570
Thank you.

1943
02:37:40.905 --> 02:37:45.910
- I thought I was gonna sneak away tonight.
- No!

1944
02:37:47.995 --> 02:37:51.039
What a glorious night.

1945
02:37:51.123 --> 02:37:53.583
Every face I see is a memory.

1946
02:37:53.625 --> 02:37:58.588
It may not be a perfectly
perfect memory.

1947
02:37:58.671 --> 02:38:04.177
Uh, sometimes we had
our ups and downs.

1948
02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:06.595
But we're all together,

1949
02:38:06.721 --> 02:38:10.057
and you're mine for a night.

1950
02:38:13.018 --> 02:38:18.815
And I'm gonna break precedent
and tell you my one candle wish.

1951
02:38:18.898 --> 02:38:22.068
That you would have a life
as lucky as mine,

1952
02:38:22.151 --> 02:38:27.156
where you can wake up
one morning and say,

1953
02:38:27.239 --> 02:38:30.284
"I don't want anything more."

1954
02:38:39.417 --> 02:38:43.337
Sixty-five years.

1955
02:38:43.379 --> 02:38:46.924
Don't they go by in a blink?

1956
02:39:29.922 --> 02:39:31.882
Hi.

1957
02:39:31.965 --> 02:39:35.552
Oh. What a night.

1958
02:39:35.635 --> 02:39:39.264
I'm having a hell of a time.

1959
02:39:42.016 --> 02:39:45.770
You were right... about Joe.

1960
02:39:45.853 --> 02:39:48.647
He, uh...

1961
02:39:48.731 --> 02:39:50.649
He is going somewhere.

1962
02:39:52.484 --> 02:39:54.486
I'm sorry.

1963
02:39:56.821 --> 02:39:59.074
You relieved?

1964
02:40:00.158 --> 02:40:03.286
Yes, but...

1965
02:40:03.327 --> 02:40:05.830
But what?

1966
02:40:12.085 --> 02:40:14.796
I want you to know
how much I love you,

1967
02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.174
that you've given a meaning to my life
that I had no right to expect,

1968
02:40:18.258 --> 02:40:20.760
that no one can
ever take from me.

1969
02:40:20.843 --> 02:40:22.970
- Dad...
- No!

1970
02:40:23.012 --> 02:40:27.099
I love you so much.

1971
02:40:27.183 --> 02:40:30.102
And I want you
to promise me something.

1972
02:40:30.185 --> 02:40:34.690
I don't want you
to ever worry about me.

1973
02:40:34.773 --> 02:40:38.276
And if anything should happen,
I'm gonna be okay.

1974
02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:41.279
And everything's
gonna be all right.

1975
02:40:41.362 --> 02:40:43.281
And I have no regrets.

1976
02:40:43.364 --> 02:40:46.701
And I want you
to feel the same way.

1977
02:40:52.456 --> 02:40:54.374
I love you, Daddy.

1978
02:40:54.458 --> 02:40:57.210
That's why it's okay.

1979
02:41:02.548 --> 02:41:04.509
No regrets?

1980
02:41:06.302 --> 02:41:08.345
No regrets.

1981
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:10.681
That's a good feeling, isn't it?

1982
02:41:10.764 --> 02:41:13.433
Yeah.

1983
02:41:17.479 --> 02:41:19.731
Everybody's saying good-bye.

1984
02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:25.069
I'm still here.

1985
02:41:26.946 --> 02:41:29.448
Would you like to dance
with me, Susan?

1986
02:41:32.409 --> 02:41:34.619
Yeah.

1987
02:41:39.874 --> 02:41:42.543
If you don't mind dancing
with an old fogey like me.

1988
02:41:42.627 --> 02:41:47.798
Oh, Dad, you're not old.

1989
02:41:52.135 --> 02:41:54.763
You'll never be old.

1990
02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:01.436
Can I get you anything, sir?

1991
02:42:01.477 --> 02:42:04.605
No.

1992
02:42:04.689 --> 02:42:07.191
Do you have any peanut butter?

1993
02:42:08.567 --> 02:42:10.778
Uh, I don't think so, sir.

1994
02:42:10.819 --> 02:42:15.574
Mmm. Thank you anyway.

1995
02:42:15.657 --> 02:42:18.159
You're welcome.

1996
02:43:57.125 --> 02:43:59.461
What's that?

1997
02:43:59.502 --> 02:44:02.046
The fireworks are starting.

1998
02:44:02.130 --> 02:44:05.299
Let's go down and watch.

1999
02:44:09.178 --> 02:44:13.140
- Shall we?
- You go on ahead, honey.

2000
02:44:13.181 --> 02:44:15.767
I'm just gonna catch my breath.

2001
02:44:23.941 --> 02:44:25.860
Okay.

2002
02:44:44.252 --> 02:44:46.212
Okay.

2003
02:45:59.863 --> 02:46:02.365
Happy birthday, Bill.

2004
02:46:02.448 --> 02:46:04.367
Thank you.

2005
02:46:07.161 --> 02:46:09.580
Did you say good-bye?

2006
02:46:09.663 --> 02:46:12.583
Not exactly.

2007
02:46:12.666 --> 02:46:16.211
I guess you have your reasons.

2008
02:46:16.294 --> 02:46:18.213
Yes.

2009
02:46:24.427 --> 02:46:26.971
Now that we have a moment,

2010
02:46:27.054 --> 02:46:31.100
would you mind if I expressed my
gratitude for what you did for Susan?

2011
02:46:33.894 --> 02:46:38.565
I've never heard her speak of
any man as she spoke of you.

2012
02:46:38.648 --> 02:46:41.693
That's what I always
wanted for her.

2013
02:46:44.028 --> 02:46:46.947
But what happens
to her now?

2014
02:46:48.199 --> 02:46:50.909
I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.

2015
02:46:50.993 --> 02:46:53.954
These things have a way
of working out.

2016
02:46:57.332 --> 02:47:01.252
Would you mind if
I expressed my gratitude?

2017
02:47:02.628 --> 02:47:05.339
For you,

2018
02:47:05.423 --> 02:47:08.050
for the time
you've given me,

2019
02:47:08.133 --> 02:47:10.302
for the person you are.

2020
02:47:12.930 --> 02:47:17.600
Don't blow smoke up my ass.
You'll ruin my autopsy.

2021
02:47:28.652 --> 02:47:31.280
It's hard to let go, isn't it?

2022
02:47:35.158 --> 02:47:37.160
Yes, it is, Bill.

2023
02:47:39.287 --> 02:47:42.373
Well, that's life.

2024
02:47:42.457 --> 02:47:44.959
What can I tell you?

2025
02:48:19.365 --> 02:48:21.326
Should I be afraid?

2026
02:48:23.327 --> 02:48:25.496
Not a man like you.

2027
02:49:57.163 --> 02:49:59.082
You're here.

2028
02:50:03.711 --> 02:50:05.671
You bet.

2029
02:50:08.883 --> 02:50:11.385
Well, where did you go?

2030
02:50:12.803 --> 02:50:16.223
I don't know.

2031
02:50:16.264 --> 02:50:18.224
I don't...

2032
02:50:23.104 --> 02:50:27.233
I... I don't know,
you know. I...

2033
02:50:29.068 --> 02:50:33.864
It's all kind of blurred up
and hazy, but...

2034
02:50:33.905 --> 02:50:38.910
Would you know what I mean if I said
I don't think I'll ever figure it out?

2035
02:50:42.872 --> 02:50:45.041
But now I'm back.

2036
02:50:50.212 --> 02:50:52.130
That's it?

2037
02:50:56.426 --> 02:51:00.180
Well, I don't know what else to say.
Looks like a hell of a party.

2038
02:51:03.141 --> 02:51:05.601
You think so?

2039
02:51:08.062 --> 02:51:10.981
You look beautiful.

2040
02:51:12.316 --> 02:51:14.776
When you disappeared
around the corner,

2041
02:51:14.860 --> 02:51:19.781
I wasn't sure if I was
ever gonna see you again.

2042
02:51:30.708 --> 02:51:32.709
Hey, are you all right?

2043
02:51:41.551 --> 02:51:45.346
- The coffee shop.
- Yep.

2044
02:51:45.388 --> 02:51:50.184
I asked you if I said something wrong and
you said no, it was so right it scared you.

2045
02:51:50.267 --> 02:51:53.020
And then you said...

2046
02:51:53.103 --> 02:51:58.400
Forgive me for saying this,
but it's been with me ever since.

2047
02:52:01.569 --> 02:52:03.488
What has?

2048
02:52:04.947 --> 02:52:07.074
You said you liked me.

2049
02:52:10.911 --> 02:52:14.081
- No.
- You didn't?

2050
02:52:15.624 --> 02:52:20.712
I said...
I liked you so much.

2051
02:52:30.429 --> 02:52:33.056
Yeah.

2052
02:52:33.098 --> 02:52:35.767
We know so little
about each other.

2053
02:52:38.728 --> 02:52:41.064
But we've got time.

2054
02:52:43.691 --> 02:52:45.609
Yeah.

2055
02:52:54.826 --> 02:52:57.829
I wish you...

2056
02:53:01.165 --> 02:53:03.960
could've known my father.

2057
02:53:06.128 --> 02:53:08.505

2058
02:53:12.259 --> 02:53:14.177
Me too.

2059
02:53:20.934 --> 02:53:22.852
What do we do now?

2060
02:53:26.564 --> 02:53:29.024

2061
02:53:30.359 --> 02:53:32.277
