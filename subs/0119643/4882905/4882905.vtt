WEBVTT

1
00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.787
MAN: Yes.

2
00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:06.384
Yes.

3
00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.933
MAN: Please. Please.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

4
00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.536
It's utter chaos around here.

5
00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.238
And I'm terrified that
we're running out of time.

6
00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.107
Am I trying to be too perfect?

7
00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.609
- Oh, but I want it to be so exquisite.
- So do we.

8
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.278
But we're trying to be too exquisite.

9
00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.414
Why not aim for the stars?

10
00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.016
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

11
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.018
We do need some answers on the flowers.

12
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.553
Yes, freesia, freesia.

13
00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:10.622
Everywhere freesia.
Daddy loves freesia.

14
00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:14.626
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Oh. Hello. Hi.

15
00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.928
- Lights?
- Lights.

16
00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.636
Not too bright and not too dark.

17
00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:25.212
I'm looking for a saffron glow,
sort of tea dance '20s.

18
00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:30.150
If food is the prose of a party,
then lights are its poetry.

19
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.416
It works. If food is the prose
of a party, lights are its poetry.

20
00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.550
I like that.

21
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.920
If music were the food of love, play on.
I'm going out of my mind.

22
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.722
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

23
00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.190
What do you think
of all this, Helen?

24
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.625
It's gonna be beautiful.

25
00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.994
And Allison says
the President may come.

26
00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.463
The President's got better things
to do than come to my birthday party.

27
00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:52.965
Like what?

28
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.200
- Daddy? Do you have a minute?
- Good morning, Allison.

29
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.469
Not much more.
Big day in the big city.

30
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.972
- What's on your mind?
- Fireworks. Update.

31
00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:02.774
We are constructing
the number 65 on the barge.

32
00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.077
Archers from the
State College of New Paltz

33
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.979
will shoot flaming arrows at it.

34
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.383
When it catches fire, it will give us
the effect of a Viking funeral,

35
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.385
but with none of the morbidity.

36
00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.220
The Hudson River authority
says that for you,

37
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.855
they'll make a special dispensation.

38
00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.458
But, of course,
there will be an overtime bill

39
00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.293
for the Poughkeepsie Fire Department.

40
00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:24.730
So, what do you think?

41
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.733
Good? No good?

42
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:30.502
Allison, I trust you.
This is your thing.

43
00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:34.382
But it's your birthday. I hate arrows.
They make me nervous.

44
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.909
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning, honey.

45
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.044
- Morning.
- Morning.

46
00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:40.612
You're "Honey." I'm "Allison."

47
00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.092
Oh.

48
00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.350
Oh, Dad, Drew called
from the helicopter,

49
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.085
and they're still two minutes away.

50
00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.724
Drew's aboard?

51
00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.556
He wanted to ride back down with you.

52
00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:55.627
So why don't you sit down, relax, and get
some food in that flat tummy of yours.

53
00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.496
- Are you coming?
- No.

54
00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:58.997
You've got patients to attend to.

55
00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.966
I've got three hysterical chefs,

56
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.135
one of whom loves truffles,
the other one hates truffles,

57
00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.504
and the third one doesn't
even know what truffles are.

58
00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:08.507
- I hate parties.
- But, Daddy, calm down.

59
00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.809
You're gonna love it. I swear.

60
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.711
Isn't it enough to be
on the Earth for 65 years

61
00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.246
without having to be reminded of it?

62
00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.589
No.

63
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.621
Will you relax?
I know it's a big deal day.

64
00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.957
- How'd you know that?
- Drew told me.

65
00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.200
- Does he tell you everything?
- I hope so.

66
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.406
- You like him, don't you?
- Yep, I guess so.

67
00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.970
- I don't want to interfere, but...
- Then don't.

68
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.017
Well, here comes our boy now.

69
00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.478
Shall we?

70
00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.983
Okay.

71
00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.523
Hello, beautiful.

72
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.930
Hi.

73
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.594
Good morning, Drew.
Thanks for coming up.

74
00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:03.295
Well, big day. Wanted to line up
a few ducks before kickoff.

75
00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:06.431
Any thoughts, last minute
refinements, variations, anything?

76
00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:10.469
Thoughts, no.
I did hear a voice last night.

77
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.571
- A voice?
- In my sleep.

78
00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:15.382
- What'd it say?
- "Yes."

79
00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.277
- Yes to the deal?
- Maybe. Who knows?

80
00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.553
You know how voices are.

81
00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.082
I thank you, Delia.

82
00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:26.825
- Okay, let's go.
- Delia, your pen.

83
00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:30.255
- Hi, Bill. How you doing?
- Morning, Quince.

84
00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.791
- I'm doing great, and you?
- Oh, I'm great.

85
00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.159
This is it, "B-day."

86
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.327
- Huh?
- Sorry.

87
00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:39.131
Bontecou day.
We're gonna close with Big John.

88
00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.199
Look at you, Bill.
You're all cool as a cat.

89
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.503
Over at Bontecou's, I'll bet
he's just shitting in his pants.

90
00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:48.340
Remember, everybody,
big meeting tonight at Daddy's.

91
00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:52.210
Dinner. You, too, Drew.
We have lots of loose ends.

92
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:55.814
- Not my birthday again?
- You're only 65 once, Dad.

93
00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.783
Thank God.
Now let's get the day started.

94
00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:00.389
ALLISON: Remember, dinner
in the city at Daddy's!

95
00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.101
It's so ridiculous.

96
00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.911
Do you love Drew?

97
00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.951
DREW: No, don't do anything.
Just stay exactly where...

98
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.910
Do you love Drew?

99
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:27.482
He's not gonna get
a better offer than that.

100
00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:32.859
- You mean, like you loved Mom?
- Forget about me and Mom.

101
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.027
Are you gonna marry him?

102
00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.534
DREW: Oh, come on.

103
00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.726
I'm probably.

104
00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:45.197
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy.
He's smart. He's aggressive.

105
00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.833
He could carry Parrish Communications

106
00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.143
into the 21 st century
and me along with it.

107
00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:53.371
So, what's wrong with that?

108
00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.749
That's for me.
I'm talking about you.

109
00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.851
It's not what you say about Drew.
It's what you don't say.

110
00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:04.921
- Maybe you're not listening.
- Oh, yes, I am.

111
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.960
DREW: Give him whatever he wants.

112
00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:11.466
There's not an ounce of excitement,
not a whisper of a thrill.

113
00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:15.827
And this relationship has all
the passion of a pair of titmice.

114
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:18.463
I want you to get
swept away out there.

115
00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:21.274
I want you to levitate.
I want you to

116
00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.102
sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish.

117
00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:27.072
- Oh, that's all.
- Yeah. Be deliriously happy,

118
00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.815
or at least
leave yourself open to be.

119
00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:31.552
Okay.

120
00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:35.447
"Be deliriously happy."
I shall...

121
00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.359
I shall do my utmost.

122
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.857
I know it's a cornball thing.

123
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:48.904
But love is passion, obsession,

124
00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.799
someone you can't live without.

125
00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.433
I say, fall head over heels.

126
00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:59.609
Find someone you can love like crazy
and who will love you the same way back.

127
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.306
How do you find him?

128
00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:05.310
Well, you forget your head,
and you listen to your heart.

129
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.256
And I'm not hearing any heart.

130
00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:12.487
'Cause the truth is, honey, there's
no sense living your life without this.

131
00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:16.588
To make the journey
and not fall deeply in love,

132
00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:19.729
well, you haven't lived a life at all.

133
00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:26.099
But you have to try, 'cause if you
haven't tried, you haven't lived.

134
00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:31.280
- Bravo!
- Oh, you're tough.

135
00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:37.275
I'm sorry. Okay.

136
00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.450
Give it to me again,
but the short version this time.

137
00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.315
Okay. Stay open.

138
00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:46.558
Who knows? Lightning could strike.

139
00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:54.427
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:04.970
QUINCE: What do you think?

141
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:08.740
Is it just the executive committee,
or are you guys gonna use me?

142
00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.041
Quince, man, thanks for the offer,

143
00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.910
but it's all set for just me and Bill.

144
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:12.978
More people might...

145
00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:16.748
I know. I know, gum up the works.

146
00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.956
BILL'S VOICE:
I want you to get swept away.

147
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.785
Huh?

148
00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.387
I was just saying to Quince
that we won't need him until...

149
00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.422
- Did you hear something?
- Yeah, but I was just saying to Quince...

150
00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:27.165
- No, no, no. Not you.
- What's the matter, Daddy?

151
00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.596
Nothing. I'm sorry.

152
00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:33.064
I want you to levitate.

153
00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:36.535
I want you to sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish.

154
00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:40.843
- "Dance like a dervish"?
- Daddy, what is it?

155
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:45.510
Nothing, I'm just talking to myself.
You know me.

156
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.213
No, I've never known you
to talk to yourself.

157
00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:51.249
Oh, well, can I give you a lift?

158
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.751
No, I'm gonna catch a cab.

159
00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.053
- Listen, are you okay?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:58.123
Got my garters on,
my ears pricked, ready for action.

161
00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:00.158
Okay. Well... Go get 'em, Pops.

162
00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.662
You're damn right. Okay.

163
00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:11.569
MAN: <i>Oh, haven't heard
that one before.</i>

164
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.272
<i>I'm sorry. I had to say it.</i>

165
00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:16.374
<i>Honey? Honey?</i>

166
00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.717
Hi, George.

167
00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.880
<i>Honey, you have to go on. Okay?</i>

168
00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:25.151
<i>There's a time to sow and a time
to reap. You have to sow.</i>

169
00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:28.220
<i>Sorry. Excuse me.</i>

170
00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:31.089
<i>No, I liked him.
I don't like him anymore.</i>

171
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.824
<i>'Cause you're my honey.</i>

172
00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:35.393
<i>Someone messes with you,
they mess with me. That's it.</i>

173
00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:38.263
<i>I'm on a plane in a heartbeat.
You let me know.</i>

174
00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:42.333
<i>Yep, when I get my phone in,
you're my first call. I promise.</i>

175
00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:43.468
<i>Hit the books, get the degree.</i>

176
00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:45.470
<i>One day we'll be hanging out
a shingle together.</i>

177
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.814
<i>How's that? Hm. Okay.</i>

178
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.081
<i>You all right? Yes.</i>

179
00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.611
<i>You bet. Be strong.</i>

180
00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.989
<i>I love you. Bye-bye.</i>

181
00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:14.367
- Morning.
- Good morning.

182
00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.139
I was talking kind of loud there.
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.086
Oh, not at all.

184
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.755
It was fascinating.

185
00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:30.821
Yeah, what was fascinating about it?

186
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.328
You and, "honey"?

187
00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:39.359
It's my kid sister.

188
00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.360
And she just broke up
with her boyfriend

189
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:45.430
and was thinking about
dropping out of law school.

190
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.767
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, nothing to be sorry about.

191
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.870
That's the way it is
with men and women, isn't it?

192
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:55.373
- What's the way?
- Nothing lasts.

193
00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.542
Oh. Yeah, I agree.

194
00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:59.716
Really? Why?

195
00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.325
No, I'm interested.

196
00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:08.831
I was just trying to be agreeable.

197
00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:13.999
Okay. All right.
I was sharp shooting.

198
00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:17.295
No, just that "nothing lasts" stuff.

199
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.563
That was the problem
with Honey's guy.

200
00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:19.731
He didn't know what he wanted.

201
00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.901
So, he's fooling around,
and she catches him at it.

202
00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:25.814
You know, like one girlfriend
isn't enough for him.

203
00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:30.883
- So, you're a one-girl guy.
- Yes, I am.

204
00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.490
- That's right.
- Right.

205
00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:38.155
Looking for her right now, actually.

206
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.888
Who knows? You might be her.

207
00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:45.256
No, don't laugh. I just got
into town. I got the new job.

208
00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:47.566
I'm trying to get into this apartment.

209
00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:53.802
Anyway, so you're a doctor.

210
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:58.303
- How'd you know?
- 'Cause everyone's a doctor around here.

211
00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.938
This apartment building...

212
00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:03.575
Everyone's in green slippers,
the green pajamas.

213
00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.376
The guy I'm waiting for to vacate...

214
00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.679
- Doctor.
- He's a doctor.

215
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.682
What kind of doctor?

216
00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.820
I'm a resident internal medicine.

217
00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:16.654
So, if I needed a doctor,
you could be it.

218
00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.923
I could be her. Yeah.

219
00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.267
You could be her.

220
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.535
Yeah, I could.

221
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:32.607
- I'm... I'm working at the hospital, so...
- I see.

222
00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:35.473
This is my lucky day.
I just get in the big, bad city,

223
00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:39.285
not only do I find a doctor,
but a beautiful woman, as well.

224
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.650
Do you mind me saying that?

225
00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:47.852
Oh... No, of course.
No, it's fine.

226
00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:49.798
It's fine. It's just...

227
00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:53.435
Listen, could I buy you
a cup of coffee?

228
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.096
I have some patients coming in,
so I should probably get going.

229
00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:01.733
Yeah, yeah. I gotta get to
the apartment and get off to work.

230
00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.544
But I'd still like to have
another cup of coffee.

231
00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:08.006
Would you let me do that?

232
00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:12.614
- Well, yeah, okay.
- Deal.

233
00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:41.639
- Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
- Morning, Jennifer.

234
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.508
So, board convenes tomorrow.

235
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:46.353
You'll recommend we close,
and it's a deal, right?

236
00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.415
As close as a deal could be.

237
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.291
Olympic.

238
00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.246
BILL'S VOICE: Yes.

239
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.989
Yes.

240
00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.192
"Yes" what?

241
00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:36.969
Yes, is the answer to your question.

242
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.040
I didn't ask any question.

243
00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:45.147
I believe you did.

244
00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.645
Who are you?

245
00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:53.911
God damn it.
What's going on here?

246
00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.346
I think you know.

247
00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.848
I don't.

248
00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.123
Try.

249
00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:03.833
'Cause if you haven't tried,
you haven't lived.

250
00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.127
What are you talking about?

251
00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:11.267
What you were talking about.

252
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.038
Who is this guy?

253
00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.737
Tell me who you are.

254
00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:21.372
Are you giving me orders?

255
00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:25.143
- No. I'm sorry, I...
- No, you're not.

256
00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:27.681
You're trying to handle the situation.

257
00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:33.125
But this is the one situation
you knew you never could handle.

258
00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:44.473
It's enough now.

259
00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.962
Talk to me, please.

260
00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:10.626
There's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

261
00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:14.169
What do you mean?

262
00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:19.466
I think you know, Bill.

263
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.475
It's kind of a pro bono job.

264
00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.478
- Pro bono?
- Yeah.

265
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.121
- Meaning, doing good?
- That's me.

266
00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:37.824
Gonna be doing good all your life?

267
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.096
I know what you're saying.
It doesn't pay so well, but, I like it.

268
00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:47.358
Eventually it'll depend
on the woman I marry, I think.

269
00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.432
Maybe she'll want lots of kids,
a bigger house, better car...

270
00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:55.209
College doesn't come cheap.
You know? I don't know.

271
00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:56.977
Wow.

272
00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:59.908
Give up what you want
for the woman you marry.

273
00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:04.375
Yeah, you know what? I would.

274
00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:06.651
- Yeah?
- Gladly.

275
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.856
'Cause you make your choices, you know?

276
00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:14.352
Say, you and I, if we were married,
I would... No, for an example, okay?

277
00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:16.921
If you and I were married, I would
want to give you what you need.

278
00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:20.191
That's all. I'm talking about taking
care of each other the best you can.

279
00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:23.261
What's wrong with taking care
of a woman? She takes care of you.

280
00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:26.597
You'll have a hard time finding
a woman like that these days.

281
00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:28.600
Shoot, you think so?

282
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:33.410
I don't know.
Lightning could strike.

283
00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:46.184
- I've gotta go.
- Yeah.

284
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.885
Listen, did I say something wrong?

285
00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.086
- No.
- No?

286
00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:51.889
- No. No. It was...
- Sure?

287
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.768
It was so right, it scares me.
That's all.

288
00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.795
Just...

289
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.233
You know, I was thinking,
I don't want you to be my doctor.

290
00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:05.579
I don't want you to examine me and...

291
00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:08.312
Why?

292
00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:12.349
Because I like you so much.

293
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.456
And I...
I don't want to examine you.

294
00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:27.834
You don't? Why not?

295
00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.896
Because I like you so much.

296
00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.569
Oh, boy. Okay.

297
00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:40.573
Now I gotta go, so...

298
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.075
- Yep, understood.
- All right. All right.

299
00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.215
Fair enough. See you.

300
00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:48.981
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

301
00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:31.549
ALLISON: Music.

302
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.517
I know how you love music, Daddy.

303
00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.519
And I want to have music
that pleases you,

304
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.190
but doesn't put a thousand
other people to sleep.

305
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:42.727
I've agonized over it and finally
settled on Sidney Brown.

306
00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:43.828
Good.

307
00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:46.332
Twenty-four men, very eclectic.

308
00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:51.406
Plus, I'm feathering in a
Latin sextet on their breaks.

309
00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:56.977
You haven't heard a word
I've said, have you?

310
00:22:59.778 --> 00:23:02.279
- What, honey? Sorry.
- Daddy.

311
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.225
BILL'S VOICE: Yes.

312
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.029
Daddy?

313
00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:10.955
LILLIAN: Mr. Parrish?

314
00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:13.993
- Yes?
- Dinner's served.

315
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.640
- Yeah.
- Never mind.

316
00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:21.509
Leave it to me.

317
00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:29.818
Did you miss me, Bill?

318
00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:34.221
Chow time, you guys.

319
00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:38.317
What are you looking
so provoked about?

320
00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:40.990
Did you miss me?

321
00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:43.656
It's a normal question.

322
00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:48.426
I missed you.
But what do I get back?

323
00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:50.227
Not an ounce of excitement.

324
00:23:50.228 --> 00:23:52.173
Not a whisper of a thrill.

325
00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:57.605
This relationship has all
the passion of a pair of titmice.

326
00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:02.684
I'm waiting outside the front door.

327
00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:06.677
- Did you speak to the governor?
- He's coming.

328
00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:09.454
- And his wife?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

329
00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:14.018
I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo
benefit. It was better than Seconal.

330
00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:16.965
I'm waiting outside
the front door, Bill.

331
00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:20.900
Won't someone let me in?

332
00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:24.998
Lillian?

333
00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:32.069
- Is there somebody at the front door?
- I didn't hear a ring, sir.

334
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.072
Have a look, would you, please?

335
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.507
ALLISON: What about the Mayor?

336
00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:38.676
QUINCE: He said he's going
to be there with bells on.

337
00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:40.811
DREW: Good. Maybe
they'll drown him out.

338
00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:42.980
- Please don't be negative, Drew.
- I'm sorry.

339
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:46.650
We have an acceptance list that
would do the White House proud,

340
00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:50.120
the chairman of the FCC,
the Secretary General of the UN.

341
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:52.356
- Wow.
- Nine senators,

342
00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:54.024
I don't know how many congressmen

343
00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:57.294
and at least 12 of the Fortune 500.

344
00:24:57.295 --> 00:25:00.764
- Any jocks?
- No.

345
00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:04.576
No 20-game-winner, Masters champion,
someone I can talk to?

346
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:10.608
You were right, Mr. Parrish.
There was a gentleman at the door.

347
00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:13.112
He's waiting for you in the foyer.

348
00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:18.549
Show him into the library.
Tell him I'll be right there.

349
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.884
Yes, sir.

350
00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:23.554
ALLISON: I've arranged favors,
silver charm bracelets for the women,

351
00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:26.156
and platinum key chains for the men,

352
00:25:26.157 --> 00:25:28.158
all engraved "WP"

353
00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:32.038
But now I'm thinking of scrubbing them.
They seem so ordinary.

354
00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:36.536
Are they ordinary? Do they
seem that way to you, Daddy?

355
00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:40.176
I don't know.

356
00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:43.211
I don't know. I...

357
00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.454
Let me see.

358
00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:55.487
I don't think they're ordinary.
I think they're great.

359
00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.366
I love key chains.

360
00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.283
Hello?

361
00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:22.652
Anyone here?

362
00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:29.860
- I said, is anyone here?
BILL'S VOICE: Quiet down.

363
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:39.473
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

364
00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:46.278
What is this, a joke, right?

365
00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:49.549
Some kind of elaborate practical joke?

366
00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:56.947
At my 40th reunion,
we delivered a casket

367
00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:59.917
to the class president's
hotel room and...

368
00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:01.556
Quiet.

369
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.630
Where are you going, Bill?

370
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.104
I...

371
00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:17.807
The great Bill Parrish
at a loss for words?

372
00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:22.539
The man from whose lips fall "rapture"
and "passion" and "obsession"?

373
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.210
All those admonitions about
being "Deliriously happy,

374
00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:29.113
"that there is no sense
living your life without."

375
00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:31.181
All the sparks
and energy you give off,

376
00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:35.755
the rosy advice you dispense
in round, pear-shaped tones.

377
00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.771
What the hell is this?

378
00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.010
Who are you?

379
00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:59.076
Just think of millenniums
multiplied by eons

380
00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:01.779
compounded by time without end.

381
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.981
I've been around that long.

382
00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:08.794
But it's only recently that your
affairs here have piqued my interest.

383
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.221
Call it boredom.

384
00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:13.991
The natural curiosity of me,
the most lasting

385
00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:18.531
and significant element in existence,
has come to see you.

386
00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:22.304
About what?

387
00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:26.907
I want to have a look around
before I take you.

388
00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:31.719
Take me where?

389
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.113
It requires competence,
wisdom and experience.

390
00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:39.883
All those things they say
about you in testimonials.

391
00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.863
And you're the one.

392
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.722
The one to do what?

393
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:48.568
Show me around, be my guide.

394
00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:52.300
And in return, you get...

395
00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:57.912
I get what?

396
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.904
Time.

397
00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:04.308
Minutes, days, weeks.

398
00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:06.610
Let's not get encumbered by detail.

399
00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:09.591
What matters is that
I stay interested.

400
00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:17.432
Yes.

401
00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:21.792
"Yes" what?

402
00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:24.933
Yes is the answer to your question.

403
00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.399
What question?

404
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.137
Oh, Bill. Come on. The question.

405
00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:37.107
The question you've been asking
yourself with increased regularity,

406
00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:40.477
at odd moments, panting through
the extra game of handball,

407
00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:42.513
when you ran for the plane in Delhi,

408
00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:46.216
when you sat up in bed last night and hit
the floor in the office this morning.

409
00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:49.820
The question that is
in the back of your throat,

410
00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:52.256
choking the blood to your brain,

411
00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:58.071
ringing in your ears over and over
as you put it to yourself.

412
00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:02.606
- The question.
- Yes, Bill.

413
00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:11.134
The question.

414
00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:19.193
Am I going to die?

415
00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:31.503
Yes.

416
00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:41.708
Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream?

417
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.886
I'm not a dream.

418
00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:47.989
You're coming to take me?

419
00:30:49.447 --> 00:30:53.395
What is that?
And who the hell are you?

420
00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.794
You are...

421
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.163
Yes?

422
00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:36.165
Who am I?

423
00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:48.411
Death.

424
00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:57.848
- You're Death?
- Yes.

425
00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:08.069
- Death.
- That's me.

426
00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:12.796
You're not Death.
You're just a kid in a suit.

427
00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:15.402
The suit came with the body I took.

428
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.973
Let me ask your opinion.

429
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.615
Do I blend in?

430
00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:28.011
You want me to be your guide?

431
00:32:28.012 --> 00:32:29.813
You fill the bill, Bill.

432
00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:31.315
I do?

433
00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:38.094
Will you be staying long?
We should hope quite a while.

434
00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.832
And then?

435
00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:53.172
It's over.

436
00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:56.707
Mr. Parrish?

437
00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.347
Will the gentleman
be staying for dinner, sir?

438
00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.215
Yes.

439
00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:08.696
Thank you.

440
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.260
This is crazy.

441
00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:18.996
You're not gonna eat dinner with us.

442
00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:22.532
No, I am eating dinner
with you and your family.

443
00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.401
And that is what we're doing.

444
00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:27.906
It's not open for discussion, nothing is.

445
00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.445
Don't you understand?

446
00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:35.454
Yeah.

447
00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:38.215
Good.

448
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.895
Now lead the way.

449
00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:46.095
Bill, lead the way.

450
00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:58.512
- Excuse me, may I say something?
- Yes, of course.

451
00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:03.206
- Well, it just occurred to me, if...
- Speak up, please.

452
00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:08.311
When I introduce you,
if I say who you are,

453
00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:11.258
I don't think
anyone will stay for dinner.

454
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.760
Then don't.

455
00:34:14.585 --> 00:34:16.428
Here's another possibility.

456
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:20.524
It's a little last minute,
but tell me what you think.

457
00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.231
Kaleidoscopes.

458
00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:25.896
Little gold kaleidoscopes.

459
00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:28.865
Some German company went kerplunk,
and Tiffany's picked all these things up,

460
00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:31.701
and they're perfect party favors.

461
00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.537
Okay, they're not
personalized or anything.

462
00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:36.848
They're just winter scenes,
dachshunds, snowflakes.

463
00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:42.285
Hi there.

464
00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:46.183
Hello.

465
00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:51.388
Sorry to have stepped away
for so long.

466
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.491
This is a friend of mine
I asked to drop by.

467
00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:57.632
We got to talking and stuff, and...

468
00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:02.276
He's gonna join us for dinner.

469
00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:07.078
- Great.
- How nice to meet you.

470
00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:10.914
And wouldn't it be nicer
if my father would introduce you?

471
00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:13.587
How nice to meet you.

472
00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:16.179
Yeah, I'm sorry.

473
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.182
This is my daughter, Allison,
and her husband, Quince,

474
00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:21.993
and Drew, my number one,
works with me.

475
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.926
Daddy, does your friend have a name?

476
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.732
- A name?
- Something he goes by?

477
00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.437
Oh, yeah, excuse me. This is...

478
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.467
This is...

479
00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:40.770
Daddy, come on. A name.
Bill, the suspense is killing me.

480
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:43.717
I'm sorry. It's...
It's gone right out of my head.

481
00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:48.647
I'm sorry. This is Joe.

482
00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.915
- Joe.
- Just plain Joe.

483
00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:55.761
- I love that name.
- Me, too. Hey, buddy.

484
00:35:57.155 --> 00:36:00.891
- Is there any more to it?
- What do you mean?

485
00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:03.998
Like "Smith" or "Jones" or...

486
00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:11.835
- Black.
- Oh, at last.

487
00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:15.172
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
- Hey, hey, Joe Black.

488
00:36:15.174 --> 00:36:18.475
Won 15, lost two
for the Brooklyn Dodgers, 1952.

489
00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:20.143
I'm king of my rotisserie league.

490
00:36:20.145 --> 00:36:22.954
- Are you?
- Yeah, he is.

491
00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.092
Shall we sit down?

492
00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.690
Right there.

493
00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:20.136
Have we met?

494
00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:23.709
- He's from out of town.
- How long you here for, Joe?

495
00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:28.018
As long as it takes.

496
00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:33.890
- You and Bill, you old friends?
- No.

497
00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:39.225
No, thank you.

498
00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.593
I have one, thank you.

499
00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.695
I get the feeling you've done
some business before.

500
00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.197
I got it.

501
00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:50.272
Have you done some business before?

502
00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:53.676
We have an arrangement now.

503
00:37:57.875 --> 00:38:00.719
What side of the industry
did you say you were on?

504
00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:03.123
I didn't say.

505
00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.884
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.

506
00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:10.120
I have a feeling you guys
got the broad strokes already.

507
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.658
You need any help with the details?

508
00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:17.335
I'm sorry, business at dinner.

509
00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:22.932
- Forgive me for being so rude.
- Certainly.

510
00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.868
Hi, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.

511
00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:27.203
I had to have dinner
with my department chief.

512
00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:28.338
You ate?

513
00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:31.107
I'm here, aren't I? I wouldn't
miss a loose ends meeting.

514
00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:34.711
What's on the table for discussion?
Party favors, flowers...

515
00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:36.780
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

516
00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:39.227
- Hello.
- Hi, Drew.

517
00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.531
What are you doing here?

518
00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.430
You know each other?

519
00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:54.801
We've met.

520
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:59.336
This morning,
the Corinth Coffee Shop.

521
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:02.044
He was...
He was looking for a doctor.

522
00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:05.342
Well, I guess he's found one.

523
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:07.322
Joe, you do get around.

524
00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:10.647
- That's your name?
ALLISON: And isn't it a lovely one?

525
00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:14.561
So sturdy, so straight. Stop it.

526
00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:19.026
Incidentally, Joe,
where are you staying?

527
00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:23.960
- Here.
- You're staying here?

528
00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:28.876
- In this house?
- Yes, in this house.

529
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:33.104
QUINCE: Great. Great. Great.

530
00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:36.206
Will that hold you, Joe?

531
00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:40.382
- Incidentally, Joe what?
- Black.

532
00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:44.756
- This is fun.
- Yes. Yes, Quince, it is.

533
00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:47.785
So, what are you doing here, Joe?

534
00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:58.094
Cat got your tongue?

535
00:39:58.095 --> 00:40:01.235
You weren't so silent this morning.

536
00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.805
This morning, yes.

537
00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.183
I wasn't quite myself.

538
00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:15.311
Well, it's a shame whoever you were
couldn't be here tonight.

539
00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:17.814
Cut it out, Susan. We've gotta talk.

540
00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:20.454
Busy day tomorrow, everybody.

541
00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:25.228
- Joe, let's go.
- Yes.

542
00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:38.568
That stuff between
you and Susan threw me.

543
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:41.379
- Threw you? Where?
- Shook me up.

544
00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:46.976
I mean, how is it that you
happened to meet my daughter?

545
00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.512
I didn't meet her.

546
00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:50.980
The young man I took met her.

547
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:54.690
That is, the fellow she encountered
in the coffee shop this morning.

548
00:40:56.587 --> 00:41:00.159
- What happened to him?
- I needed a body, Bill.

549
00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:06.030
So...

550
00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.305
Come in.

551
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:22.820
Bathroom, tub, towels, sauna,
chairs, lamps, bed.

552
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:44.834
Well, if there is anything
else, don't hesitate.

553
00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:46.279
I won't.

554
00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:02.478
I can try.

555
00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:05.323
- Will she be available next week?
- I don't know.

556
00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:09.252
Yes, sir?

557
00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:12.097
Hello. I'm Joe Black.

558
00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:16.693
- It's nice meeting you.
- Yes, of course, Mr. Black, sir.

559
00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.229
A pleasure.

560
00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.739
What is that?

561
00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:26.970
- You mean this, sir?
- Yes.

562
00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:30.748
It's, Laura Scudder's
peanut butter, sir.

563
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.582
You like it?

564
00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.547
Well, I would say, in my opinion,

565
00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:41.120
it's right up there
with Jif and Skippy.

566
00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:43.687
Could I offer you a taste, sir?

567
00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:47.601
- Yes.
- All right.

568
00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:23.303
Do you fancy it, sir?

569
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.040
More? Right.

570
00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:49.561
You're a peanut butter man
now, eh, sir?

571
00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:53.694
Yes, I believe I am.

572
00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:57.562
I thoroughly enjoy
this peanut butter.

573
00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:01.707
And I thoroughly enjoyed
meeting you all.

574
00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.379
- I'll be moseying on.
- Right, sir.

575
00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:40.271
What are you doing here?

576
00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:42.914
I'm lost.

577
00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:48.415
I can't seem to escape you today.

578
00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:52.621
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

579
00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:14.371
Would you hand me one of those?

580
00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:34.798
You must have something very big
going on with my father.

581
00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:37.037
- Big?
- Yeah.

582
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:40.163
You appear at his side
out of the blue,

583
00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:42.465
stay at his house,
have dinner with his family.

584
00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:46.141
That's, practically a first.

585
00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:52.377
You're in the red-hot center of big business,
and I thought you were just a regular Joe.

586
00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:57.647
- I am Joe.
- Not the one that I met this morning.

587
00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:01.851
Hitting on me in as nice a way as
I've been hit on in a long time.

588
00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:05.527
The second that you found out
I was my father's daughter, you...

589
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:11.136
Well, you acted like a stranger.

590
00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.832
That is not my intention.

591
00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:18.038
What are your intentions? Huh?

592
00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:21.404
I mean, just to

593
00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:24.707
make little dramas in coffee shops,
turn a woman's head?

594
00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:28.077
I don't mind admitting that
my head was turned.

595
00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.852
I liked it.

596
00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:35.260
But, well, 10 hours later,
I feel like a fool.

597
00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:38.554
I just don't get it. I don't.

598
00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:41.557
You, my father,
here in this house. It's...

599
00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:44.095
It's upsetting me, and I...

600
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:49.174
What happened to that sweet guy
from the coffee shop?

601
00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:52.112
Who are you, anyway?

602
00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:57.608
And... What are you eating?

603
00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.547
Peanut butter.

604
00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.322
But it's gone now.

605
00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:15.769
No. Please.

606
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.629
You act like you've never had
peanut butter before.

607
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.074
I haven't.

608
00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:25.001
- What kind of childhood did you have?
- Do you love Drew?

609
00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:26.412
Excuse me?

610
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:30.645
When you put your mouth to his,
it seemed a frequent thing.

611
00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:37.847
Drew is none of your business,
and neither is where I put my mouth.

612
00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:40.316
I'm sorry. Do you live here?

613
00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:43.352
No, Joe, I'm swimming here
and now I'm going home.

614
00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:46.489
Yes, I think what
I'm trying to say is,

615
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.867
I would like it if we were friends.

616
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.707
- I've got plenty of friends.
- I don't have any.

617
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:58.435
Well, I can see why.

618
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.945
I didn't mean
to offend you at dinner.

619
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:14.862
I'm sometimes not quite
at home around people.

620
00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:20.456
I get busy doing what it is I do.

621
00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:24.496
And I don't seem to have developed...

622
00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:28.671
Yes?

623
00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:39.651
I have a certain function to perform,
and it seems to take up most of my time.

624
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:44.391
But sometimes I speculate

625
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.627
that I haven't left room for

626
00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:54.930
anything else.

627
00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:05.005
I'm sorry to say
I know what you mean.

628
00:50:17.614 --> 00:50:19.218
Well...

629
00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:28.534
- Good night, Joe.
- Yes. Good night to you, Susan.

630
00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:34.864
- Morning, Madeline.
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Parrish.

631
00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:37.600
- Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

632
00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:38.875
Good.

633
00:50:56.787 --> 00:51:00.359
- Morning.
- Good morning, Bill.

634
00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.899
What's on the docket for today?

635
00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:13.040
- Docket?
- Yes. What shall we do?

636
00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:18.350
- Well, I have to go to work, and...
- Splendid. I'll join you.

637
00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:23.979
- Would you like to ride or walk?
- Walk.

638
00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.221
I wish to see the world.

639
00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:32.395
This is crazy. This is the left
field thing of all time. I...

640
00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.157
I don't know
if I can get through this.

641
00:51:35.158 --> 00:51:38.461
- What do I do? What do I tell my family?
- You'll get through this, Bill.

642
00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:41.964
As far as your family's concerned,
I wouldn't say anything.

643
00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:44.672
You'll ruin the great start
we had last night.

644
00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:49.572
It felt as if I was being
treated like a person.

645
00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:51.674
Yes, Joe this, Joe that.

646
00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:54.712
A nice smile.
Quince passed me the rolls.

647
00:51:55.879 --> 00:52:01.083
No passion or rapture or any of these mighty
things you're so intent on imparting.

648
00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:06.693
But I am certain, should you say who I am,
our adventure would end abruptly.

649
00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.841
And I did so enjoy your family.

650
00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:21.977
What about my family? This adventure
involves only me, right?

651
00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.545
What do you mean?

652
00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.145
I'll tell you what.

653
00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:33.449
You promise this undertaking
of yours involves only me and...

654
00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.985
And what?

655
00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:38.554
I won't tell anyone who you are.
Sounds fair enough.

656
00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:41.891
Good. Is it a deal?

657
00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:44.627
- A deal?
- Yeah.

658
00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:47.696
You give your word, I give mine
that we'll do what we say.

659
00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:51.567
It is a truth exchanged
between two people.

660
00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.736
- Bill?
- What?

661
00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.409
You have a deal.

662
00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:05.017
That's great.

663
00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.091
Great.

664
00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:13.695
You know, I got to thinking.

665
00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:18.961
With you here
and seemingly occupied,

666
00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:21.730
how's your work going,
I mean, elsewhere?

667
00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:25.610
While you were shaving this morning,
you weren't just shaving.

668
00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:29.238
What do you mean?
You were hatching ideas,

669
00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:32.441
making plans,
arriving at decisions, right?

670
00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:34.310
Yeah, I guess so.

671
00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:36.178
So you understand the concept.

672
00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:38.247
While part of you
is busy doing one thing,

673
00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:40.082
another part of you
is doing another,

674
00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:42.751
perhaps even attending
to the problems of your work.

675
00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:45.255
- Correct?
- Of course.

676
00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:49.858
So you understand the idea.
Congratulations, Bill.

677
00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:52.928
Now multiply that by infinity,
take that to the depths of forever,

678
00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:56.604
and you still will barely have
a glimpse of what I'm talking about.

679
00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:05.311
- Joe?
- Yes, Bill?

680
00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:10.246
How about giving a guy a break?

681
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:12.248
Make an exception?

682
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:15.662
- Well, there's one to every rule.
- Not this.

683
00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:19.121
And call my family. I'd like them
to have dinner with me tonight.

684
00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:21.625
Didn't the family
get together last night?

685
00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:26.205
- Jennifer.
- Of course, Mr. Parrish, right away.

686
00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:29.475
- Perhaps you'd like to wait in my office.
- No.

687
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.836
What I'm trying to say is this is a
board meeting and you're not a member.

688
00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:36.647
I'm sure you'll find a way
to make it all right.

689
00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:39.347
Nice to meet you.

690
00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:41.810
Morning.

691
00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:43.790
MAN: Morning, Bill.
ALL: Good morning.

692
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.984
Thank you. Eddie.

693
00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:51.328
This is Joe Black.

694
00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:56.825
- He's a personal associate of mine, and...
- Hello, Quince.

695
00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:59.161
- Hey.
- He'll be joining us this morning.

696
00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:02.507
I know this is unusual,
and my apologies, and...

697
00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:06.509
- Drew, carry on.
- It's nice to see you.

698
00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:12.107
Didn't expect you, but certainly
you can't get enough of a good thing.

699
00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:15.145
- Thank you.
- Joe, would you like to sit there?

700
00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.727
Okay.

701
00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:32.999
The Board of Parrish Communications
is hereby called to order.

702
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.609
Our sole order of...

703
00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:43.949
Our...

704
00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:54.083
Our sole order of business
today is a,

705
00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:57.453
is an acceptance of
John Bontecou's generous offer.

706
00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:58.554
And I think Bill...

707
00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.989
Do you have any more
of these delicious cookies?

708
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.730
The jelly ones?

709
00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:06.063
And a cup of tea.
With milk, I think.

710
00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:10.299
I'd like to try it
English style. Yes.

711
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.834
A cup of tea with milk, please.

712
00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:14.008
Is there anything else, Mr. Black?

713
00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.605
- How about some water?
- Why, yes, thank you.

714
00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:18.813
- Hot or cold?
- Cold.

715
00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:20.951
And a glass?

716
00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:27.916
To review.

717
00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:30.988
We're really crossing the T's
and dotting the I's here.

718
00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:35.290
Bill had a great and conclusive
meeting yesterday with John Bontecou,

719
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:38.294
and all that remains for us
is to put it to a vote.

720
00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:44.205
Thank you. Drew...

721
00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:49.548
Yeah.

722
00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:52.341
I did enjoy,
or rather I was interested

723
00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:57.223
in meeting John Bontecou
yesterday, and...

724
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:03.762
Impressive, I suppose.

725
00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:12.595
But...

726
00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:16.801
it did get me to thinking.

727
00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:23.078
See, I started in this business
because this is what I wanted to do.

728
00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:27.651
I knew I wasn't gonna write
the great American novel.

729
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:31.613
But I also knew there was more
to life than buying something for $1

730
00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:33.718
and selling it for $2.

731
00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:36.118
I'd hoped to create something,

732
00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:40.756
something which could be
held to the highest standards.

733
00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:43.032
And what I realized was I...

734
00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:47.470
I wanted to give the news
to the world.

735
00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:51.040
And I wanted to give it unvarnished.

736
00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.603
The more we all know
about each other,

737
00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:57.039
the greater the chance
we will survive.

738
00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.749
Sure, I want to make a profit.
You can't exist without one, but,

739
00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:05.318
John Bontecou is all profit.

740
00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:10.219
If we give him license to absorb
Parrish Communications

741
00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.222
and he has his eye
on a few others after us,

742
00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:18.536
in order to reach the world, you will
have to go through John Bontecou.

743
00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:20.863
And not only will you have
to pay him to do this,

744
00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:24.174
far more important,
you'll have to agree with him.

745
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:30.138
Reporting the news is a
privilege and a responsibility.

746
00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:32.312
And it is not exploitable.

747
00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:36.388
Parrish Communications
has earned this privilege.

748
00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:39.259
John Bontecou wants to buy it.

749
00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:46.327
As your chairman,
I urge you to agree.

750
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:50.230
This company is not for sale.

751
00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:58.867
It sounds like you're not leaving
much room for discussion.

752
00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

753
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:03.071
I know. I'm sorry, I...
Looks like I'm reversing my field.

754
00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:05.240
That's your privilege, Bill.

755
00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:08.043
But given our needs, given the
absolute necessity for growth,

756
00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:09.244
given the future, the truth is,

757
00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:12.988
joining John Bontecou is every bit
as certain as death and taxes.

758
00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:18.994
- Death and taxes?
- Yes.

759
00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:22.824
- What an odd pairing.
- It's just a saying, Mr. Black.

760
00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:24.927
- By whom?
- Doesn't matter.

761
00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:27.297
Then why did you bring it up?

762
00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:29.765
You're not familiar with the phrase,

763
00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:32.100
"In this world nothing is certain
but death and taxes"?

764
00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:35.304
- Well, I am now.
- Glad I could be of some help.

765
00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:38.707
I keep regular office hours if there's
any further information you might need

766
00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:41.677
on sayings, common phrases,
manners of speaking.

767
00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.445
My door's wide open.

768
00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:46.081
The tea I can provide,
perhaps even the milk.

769
00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.492
Low fat.

770
00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:50.686
Yeah, okay, well...

771
00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:53.188
I think we've accomplished everything
we're going to this morning.

772
00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:54.323
Shall we adjourn?

773
00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:57.794
- But the matter is still on the table, Bill.
- Joe?

774
00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.438
Yes.

775
01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.744
Thank you for the delicious cookies.

776
01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.253
Who is that guy?

777
01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:26.860
So, what's the deal here?

778
01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:31.259
You gonna be breathing down
my neck right till the very end?

779
01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.707
- I don't understand.
- I'd like to be alone for a while.

780
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.503
- Are you sad, Bill?
- Yes, I am.

781
01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:43.705
Why don't you take a walk
or something, get some air?

782
01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.446
I know I'll be seeing you.

783
01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.353
Of course.

784
01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.723
Good. Now I'd like to be alone.

785
01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.550
This will hold you for a while.

786
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:56.985
You know about money, don't you?

787
01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.721
- It can't buy happiness?
- Yeah.

788
01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.456
Jennifer?

789
01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.859
Give Mr. Black
a map of the city, would you?

790
01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.896
It's okay, Bill. I can manage.

791
01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:15.737
- Hi.
- Hi.

792
01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:18.741
I need a medical record
number for labs.

793
01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:22.717
And will you try calling her husband?
The number's on top.

794
01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:31.453
- Also, can you page me when CT's ready?
- Oh, sure.

795
01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.796
Thanks, sweetie.

796
01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:39.561
How nice you look.
Is that your uniform?

797
01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:41.473
What are you doing here?

798
01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:48.003
- Are you ill?
- Oh, goodness, no.

799
01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:51.883
- Then why are you here, Joe?
- I'm here to see you.

800
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.746
Joe, I don't... I don't have time
to see you right now.

801
01:01:57.747 --> 01:02:00.115
I'm about to start making rounds,

802
01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:03.318
and I'm examining back-to-back
patients until dinner, and...

803
01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:05.162
Very well. I'll watch.

804
01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:06.888
Watch me do what?

805
01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:09.528
Make rounds and examine
back-to-back patients.

806
01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:14.768
- Joe, that's impossible. I'm a doctor.
- And I'll be a visitor.

807
01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:19.744
- Patients have visitors, not doctors.
- I don't mind.

808
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.839
WOMAN: Miss? Miss?

809
01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.509
- Doctor.
- Just one second. I'll be right there.

810
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:30.047
Please. My mama is sicker than him.

811
01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.482
Okay.

812
01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:41.123
- Obeah.
- No, Mama.

813
01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:42.933
Obeah, man.

814
01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:47.262
- I going die.
- Mama, stop it. It's just a man.

815
01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:49.898
SUSAN: What's Obeah?
- Bad spirit. She just all fever.

816
01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:52.601
- She don't mean nothing. Please help us.
- Of course.

817
01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:57.710
No Obeah, sister.
Everything gonna be all right.

818
01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:06.081
- Have you registered?
- No.

819
01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.561
Okay.

820
01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:17.793
You gonna be all right, Mama?

821
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.662
Go with the doctor lady.
Mama gonna be fine now.

822
01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:24.699
- Don't leave. Don't leave me.
- She'll be right back, okay?

823
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.144
Mama.

824
01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:38.847
- Obeah.
- Rahtid.

825
01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:41.419
Obeah evil. I not evil, woman.

826
01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.557
And what you is then?

827
01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.763
I from that next place.

828
01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.866
You waiting here to take us?

829
01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.563
Like you is the bus driver to there?

830
01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:57.476
No, man, I on holiday.

831
01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:02.248
Some spot you pick.

832
01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:12.654
The pain. Pain is bad, bad.

833
01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:16.053
I don't have nothing to do
with these things, you know.

834
01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:20.298
- Make it go away.
- Doctor lady make it all right.

835
01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.401
Not this pain.

836
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.665
This pain go through
and through me.

837
01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.165
- Make it go away.
- I can't, sister.

838
01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.940
You can, mister.

839
01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:36.104
Take me to that next place.

840
01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.940
- It's not your time now.
- Make it time.

841
01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:41.580
You can't fool
with the way things got to be.

842
01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:43.688
Please?

843
01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.221
Where she was born.

844
01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.526
Close your eyes.

845
01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.599
Go on, sister.

846
01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:33.935
Soon.

847
01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.636
You... You can go with her.
I'll be right there.

848
01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.241
Come now, Mama.

849
01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:52.959
- She's in a great deal of pain.
- Yes.

850
01:05:56.018 --> 01:06:00.364
- Have you spent much time in the islands?
- Some.

851
01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:07.106
I realize now my being here,

852
01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.198
is not quite appropriate.

853
01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:14.044
Oh, no, please.
Please don't apologize.

854
01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:17.349
- Yes?
- Yeah.

855
01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.288
I'm glad that you came.

856
01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.284
Thank you, Susan.
I'm very happy to be here.

857
01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.200
Joe, I'm with Drew.

858
01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.963
Not now.

859
01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.344
I have to go.

860
01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:50.340
- I'm sorry to say...
- Be sorry for nothing.

861
01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:54.884
Right.

862
01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:59.485
- Thanks, Joe.
- Good-bye, Susan.

863
01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:13.867
Good?

864
01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:20.808
- Yes, what is it?
- Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.

865
01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.247
A little Coleman's mustard.

866
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.184
It's splendid.

867
01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:30.650
Glad you like it.

868
01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:37.660
My wife turned me on
to cold lamb sandwiches.

869
01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:44.295
Joan was my wife.

870
01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:59.343
Yeah. Cold lamb sandwiches.

871
01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:04.090
Not as chewy as roast beef,
not as boring as chicken.

872
01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:08.185
She knew stuff like that.

873
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.830
Everything reminds me of her.

874
01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.795
There isn't a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

875
01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:24.777
One day she didn't feel well.
The next day she was gone.

876
01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.774
So what are you gonna do?

877
01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.443
Yeah.

878
01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:39.016
I guess you've heard all this
a trillion times before, huh?

879
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:43.988
- More.
- Why didn't you stop me?

880
01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.327
I don't know.

881
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.966
What was it like when you first met?

882
01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:56.941
I thought you'd heard it
a trillion times before.

883
01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:59.576
This part I'm interested in.

884
01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:08.648
Well, she had on
this little blue suit

885
01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:18.992
with a little white collar
that had a little red piping on it.

886
01:09:24.793 --> 01:09:26.067
Yeah?

887
01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:30.602
Hi.

888
01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:35.605
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

889
01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:40.013
- No.
- Just kidding?

890
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.044
Sit down, Drew.

891
01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.788
Before I do, I was hoping
we might be alone, Bill.

892
01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:50.553
Well, Joe and I have no secrets
from each other.

893
01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.664
How nice for you both.

894
01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.429
Pardon my candor, but I was confounded
by your decision this morning.

895
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.331
- Why?
- I was hired,

896
01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:07.168
you told me, to help bring Parrish
Communications into the 21 st century.

897
01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.870
This merger is the vehicle in my...

898
01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.739
Perhaps a merger is a way to bring
Bill's company into the 21 st century,

899
01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.608
and perhaps it isn't.

900
01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:16.611
And perhaps cheating on your French
philosophers exam at the Groton School

901
01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:20.248
was an expedient way to get your diploma,
and perhaps it wasn't.

902
01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:25.255
Be that as it may, Drew, a question
can often be argued both ways.

903
01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:28.193
Joe, cut it out.
You, too, Drew.

904
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.730
I thought this was practically a done deal.
Well, now it's undone, okay?

905
01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:38.933
Forget Bontecou. Scrub him.

906
01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:42.503
I'm tired of his fancy name
and his fancy offer.

907
01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.449
I'm not going for it.

908
01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.181
Okay.

909
01:10:57.486 --> 01:11:00.488
Bill, why at this juncture

910
01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:03.868
are you letting yourself be so
concerned by business matters?

911
01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.930
'Cause I don't want anybody
buying up my life's work!

912
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:12.000
Turning it into something
it wasn't meant to be.

913
01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.368
A man wants to leave
something behind.

914
01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:16.137
He wants it left behind
the way he made it.

915
01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.472
He wants it to be run
the way he ran it,

916
01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:21.075
with a sense of honor,
of dedication, of truth. Okay?

917
01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:25.422
Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself
a heart attack and ruin my vacation.

918
01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:45.734
Now listen.

919
01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:49.137
I read you all the way
on the Bontecou thing,

920
01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:53.141
and I know where you're coming from,
and I am with you 101%.

921
01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.178
Well, thank you, Quince.

922
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:02.785
But I just gotta tell you,
if mergers are in the wind,

923
01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:06.754
I've developed some great prospects.

924
01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:10.325
And I want to come and talk to you about...
about them next week.

925
01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.567
- Next week?
- Yeah.

926
01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:14.901
Or the week after.

927
01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.202
- No good?
- No. Why, anything's possible.

928
01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:23.945
- It's up to Joe.
- Joe.

929
01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.542
You just don't know
how glad I am you're aboard,

930
01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:30.378
because anybody who can take some
of the weight off the old man,

931
01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:33.359
I am... I'm in his corner.

932
01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:38.519
That's very gracious of you,
Quince. It's no problem.

933
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.694
Well, I'll leave you two alone,
because I can...

934
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:46.639
I can tell, you know,
you got something in the fire.

935
01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:54.836
Now, look, I know you're down.

936
01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:59.307
But you know, when you're down, Drew,
there's no place to go but up.

937
01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.609
Up. Thanks, Quince.

938
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.678
Forget about Bontecou.

939
01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:06.314
I got a couple other merger
possibilities up my sleeve,

940
01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:08.416
and I'm pitching them
to the old man.

941
01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.518
- Were you?
- Yeah.

942
01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:13.363
Hey, listen.

943
01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:17.225
We're gonna go in together.
I'll clue you in.

944
01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:22.971
The timing has gotta be right,
because the old man says it's up to Joe.

945
01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:28.936
He said it's up to Joe?

946
01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:31.839
- Those were his words?
- Yeah.

947
01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.941
- It's up to Joe, huh?
- Yeah.

948
01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:37.582
- That's what he said?
- That's what he... That's what he said.

949
01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.486
That's very interesting.

950
01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.519
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought so, too.

951
01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:54.734
I want to thank you all for coming.

952
01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.533
My family, Allison and Quince,

953
01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:01.139
Susan and the other members.

954
01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.849
And...

955
01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.111
So glad when we can get together.

956
01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.714
I mean, I know you all
have busy lives.

957
01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:16.384
- Look who's talking.
- Yeah. Speak for yourself.

958
01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:17.989
Yeah.

959
01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:22.896
I remember when you were
little girls, and...

960
01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.528
I love little girls.

961
01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:31.704
And, now you're
all grown up, and I...

962
01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:38.080
I had some words prepared,
but I've forgotten them.

963
01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.747
Wait a minute...

964
01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:48.586
- There's so much I wanted to say...
- Daddy?

965
01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:53.221
- You could sit down if you want to.
- Yeah.

966
01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.429
So many words I wanted to...

967
01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.334
So much I wanted to say, but...

968
01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.975
I can't, and so...

969
01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.535
Yeah, I better sit down.

970
01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.814
Carry on, everybody, please.
Oh, one other thing.

971
01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:19.981
Why don't we all have dinner again
tomorrow night, okay?

972
01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:21.649
- Dinner again?
- Yeah.

973
01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:24.357
You haven't had enough of us yet, Dad?

974
01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:30.433
Mmm...

975
01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.565
No.

976
01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:39.104
Come here.

977
01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.405
- We'll be here.
- You bet we'll be here.

978
01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.510
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

979
01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:50.884
Joe.

980
01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:01.623
Oh, no.

981
01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:05.361
I would prefer some peanut butter.

982
01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:09.597
How would you like that, sir?
On some kind of toast?

983
01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:10.804
Toast.

984
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.713
No, just the butter.
Right away, sir.

985
01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:21.383
- Why do you like peanut butter so much?
- I don't know.

986
01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:24.879
I adore things like that.

987
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.919
- Food I can't do without. Don't you?
- Yes.

988
01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:33.661
- It comforts you, doesn't it?
- Yes, I find that it does.

989
01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:37.496
- Mind if I throw up?
- Drew. Please.

990
01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:47.002
I'm very concerned about
the woman you attended to today.

991
01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:50.249
- I am, too.
- Has her pain abated?

992
01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:54.575
We're doing what we can for her,

993
01:16:54.576 --> 01:16:56.111
but it's not looking very good.

994
01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.880
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

995
01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:01.482
Who are we talking about?

996
01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:04.485
But I know she's grateful
for the care you're giving her.

997
01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:07.321
Is this a state secret? Or we being
excluded just for the fun of it?

998
01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:09.757
No, we're talking about
a patient of mine,

999
01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:13.137
'cause Joe stopped by
the hospital today.

1000
01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:15.730
ALLISON: He did?

1001
01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.565
That's more than we get to do.

1002
01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:20.468
Maybe next time you go to the hospital,
you'll take us along with you.

1003
01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.837
- Perhaps you could remind me.
- Well, I'll make a note of it.

1004
01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.773
- Anything else I can do for you?
- I wanna come along too.

1005
01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:28.009
- See Susie strut her stuff.
- You're on, Quincie.

1006
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:32.151
- Destination, hospital.
- Joe, you can be the tour guide, okay?

1007
01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:38.059
Susan's a wonderful doctor.

1008
01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.498
I'm sure she is.

1009
01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.428
- Bill?
- Yeah?

1010
01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.263
I have to go.
It's been a hell of a day.

1011
01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:52.802
- I need a few minutes to sort everything out.
- See you tomorrow.

1012
01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.611
Joe?

1013
01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.490
Yes, Bill?

1014
01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:18.959
- Why'd you go to the hospital?
- I don't know.

1015
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.430
- You just curious?
- I guess.

1016
01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.032
About Susan?

1017
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:29.046
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- How would you put it?

1018
01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:34.942
- You tell me, Bill.
- No, how about you telling me?

1019
01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:37.812
I ask a simple question,
I expect a straight answer.

1020
01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:41.488
That's what I'm used to. Anybody who
doesn't give it to me, I fire.

1021
01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.260
Are you going to fire me, Bill?

1022
01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:49.662
Drew?

1023
01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:54.466
So, I'll see you tomorrow night?

1024
01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:58.899
You include me out. I've had
enough of the convocations.

1025
01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:02.503
You don't mean that.
You don't want to disappoint Dad.

1026
01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:07.374
Daddy will do fine. Besides,
he's got Joe. And it seems you do too.

1027
01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.476
You're out of line.

1028
01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.578
Well, that may be, but I don't
like the ubiquitous creep.

1029
01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.846
I don't like the way
he looks at you.

1030
01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:14.793
I don't like the way
he talks to you.

1031
01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:16.992
And vice versa.

1032
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.759
I'm sorry.

1033
01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:29.074
'Cause I like the way
he looks and talks to me.

1034
01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.840
And vice versa.

1035
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.340
Okay?

1036
01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.046
Not okay.

1037
01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:44.214
Thought we had
a good thing going here.

1038
01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.888
I thought it was a good thing.

1039
01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:51.361
Well, that just goes to show
you never know.

1040
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.234
Night.

1041
01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.760
Good night.

1042
01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:23.029
How long have
you been standing there?

1043
01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.827
I don't like the way
he spoke to you.

1044
01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:31.562
But I feel better now
because of the way you spoke back.

1045
01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.599
Tell me about yourself, Joe.

1046
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.302
I mean, who are you?

1047
01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:45.080
What are you doing here
with my father?

1048
01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:51.751
You're not going to tell me?

1049
01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:04.398
You're married, aren't you?

1050
01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.630
Why?

1051
01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:11.502
Because men who never say anything
about themselves, they're...

1052
01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.070
They're always married.

1053
01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:25.947
- So you're married?
- No, I'm not.

1054
01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:32.092
- But you have a girlfriend.
- No.

1055
01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:39.336
- Gay?
- No.

1056
01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.539
So, tell me, Joe...

1057
01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:58.555
How come a man as attractive,
intelligent, well-spoken,

1058
01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:09.230
diffident in the most
seductive way, and yet

1059
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.666
powerful

1060
01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:19.972
is all alone in this world?

1061
01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.795
I'm sorry.

1062
01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:42.199
I'm... I didn't mean to pry,

1063
01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:50.007
and you obviously don't want
to tell me, so we'll just...

1064
01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.676
We'll just leave it a mystery.

1065
01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:04.714
- That is the way you want it, isn't it?
- Yes, thank you.

1066
01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:21.601
- Where are you going?
- To bed.

1067
01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:27.710
- To bed?
- Yes. I'm tired.

1068
01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:36.910
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night. Sleep well.

1069
01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:39.646
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Good night. See you.

1070
01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:42.249
- Good night.
- Good night, Susie. Get some sleep.

1071
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.617
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.

1072
01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:45.722
- Good night.
- Good night.

1073
01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.832
That was wonderful.

1074
01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:55.232
It's good to get together.

1075
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:05.239
Do you mind if I raise
a little caution flag?

1076
01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.878
Raise away.

1077
01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:11.389
What is the nature
of your interest in Joe?

1078
01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:15.220
Well...

1079
01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:19.654
Remember how you told me
about lightning striking?

1080
01:24:22.424 --> 01:24:25.962
The nature of it's in there somewhere.

1081
01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:30.531
Yeah. Well, I won't say
you're on the wrong track, but...

1082
01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:32.511
Then what will you say?

1083
01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:40.810
I don't think this is the lightning
you're looking for.

1084
01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:42.910
I mean, Drew is a good man.

1085
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:45.546
I know I didn't seem to be
completely in his corner before,

1086
01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:48.152
but I've come to appreciate that...

1087
01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.653
Now we love Drew?
And Joe doesn't measure up?

1088
01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:55.862
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1089
01:24:57.425 --> 01:25:00.494
When you say "nothing" that way,
it is not nothing.

1090
01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:02.997
- Then what is it?
- It's something.

1091
01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:10.682
Okay. Good night.

1092
01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:14.347
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Good night.

1093
01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:25.024
I know you're all as uncomfortable
as I am to be meeting like this.

1094
01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:28.689
But I got a call last night
from John Bontecou.

1095
01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:33.400
Not only is he still interested,
he's sweetening his offer.

1096
01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:38.098
Although it pains me
to say it, in my opinion,

1097
01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:44.140
Bill Parrish dealt with us preemptively
in dismissing any deal with Bontecou.

1098
01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:48.809
Therefore, I'm sorry to say that if we're
to examine this new offer responsibly,

1099
01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.450
as the Board of Directors
of Parrish Communications,

1100
01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:55.552
we must do so without its Chairman.

1101
01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:59.189
There's one additional element.

1102
01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:02.089
Bontecou is so anxious to get us,

1103
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:07.539
he said he'd take Parrish Communications
with Bill Parrish or without.

1104
01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:20.610
In this crisis, and be assured
this is a crisis,

1105
01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:23.610
it's not pleasant
to say the following.

1106
01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:25.750
But I would be remiss if I did not.

1107
01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:30.117
When we present Bill
with the improved Bontecou offer,

1108
01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:32.486
and if he still refuses
to let us consider it,

1109
01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:38.392
once more makes an adamant or emotional
rejection, we will have no choice but to...

1110
01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:40.896
You're taking this too far, Drew.

1111
01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:44.242
Am I not obligated to?

1112
01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:52.883
See if Quince is here.

1113
01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:56.810
How did all this come about?

1114
01:26:56.811 --> 01:27:00.681
Crisis, Bill Parrish.
Crisis, his company. Crisis for us.

1115
01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:04.459
It came about with the arrival
on the scene of Mr. Joe Black.

1116
01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:08.722
Mr. Joe who? Joe Black.

1117
01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:11.066
He attends our board meetings.

1118
01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:14.728
He sleeps at Bill's house.
He resides in his office.

1119
01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:17.097
He never leaves his side,
and, in my opinion,

1120
01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:19.600
is always in his ear,
telling Bill what to do.

1121
01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:21.635
And Bill is listening.

1122
01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.775
Who is Joe Black?

1123
01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:27.307
What... What is his relationship
to Bill Parrish,

1124
01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:31.211
and most important, what is behind
his influence on our Chairman?

1125
01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:36.161
He's had advisors before.
Nobody tells Bill what to do.

1126
01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:45.192
- Thanks for coming, Quince.
- Sure. Hi, Ed.

1127
01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:47.263
Hi, folks.

1128
01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:52.165
I didn't know everybody
was going to be here.

1129
01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.736
Nice surprise.

1130
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:59.247
- What's with the new digs?
- Drew's idea of cloak and dagger.

1131
01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:02.509
This is a secret meeting, Quince.

1132
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:04.990
I hope you'll respect its nature.

1133
01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.434
Have a seat, Quince.

1134
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.541
Now, what we're trying
to do here is to...

1135
01:28:34.542 --> 01:28:39.047
to gather our thoughts in light of
Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer

1136
01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:42.749
and to make an appropriate presentation
to him as to how we think

1137
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.889
the company might proceed.

1138
01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:49.265
Won't you share with our board
the information you gave me last night?

1139
01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.464
Well, I'm... I'm happy
to tell you I got good news.

1140
01:28:57.465 --> 01:29:00.468
As I was, as I was telling Drew,

1141
01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:05.339
I've been making a little hay
while the Bontecou sun was shining.

1142
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:09.843
Two, possibly three, new and
boiling hot prospects for merger.

1143
01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:12.746
And how did Bill react
to the leads you've developed?

1144
01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:13.880
He was interested.

1145
01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:16.884
Yeah, but he was concerned
about the timing?

1146
01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:21.230
- Timing?
- Yeah, he was concerned about the timing?

1147
01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:25.299
Yes. He says it's up to Joe.

1148
01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:31.168
It's up to Joe.

1149
01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:48.915
Dum-da-dum.

1150
01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.258
What's this?

1151
01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:55.288
- Annie made them.
- Who's Annie?

1152
01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:58.091
Thank you, Lillian.
From La Rosette?

1153
01:29:58.092 --> 01:30:01.437
She's only the most famous
pastry chef in America.

1154
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:05.265
This is orange, made with
real Seville oranges.

1155
01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:08.769
And, that's lemon
on a mille-feuilles crust.

1156
01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.510
I don't like cake.

1157
01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:15.015
It's for the party, Dad.

1158
01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:21.317
- The goddamn party.
- The goddamn party.

1159
01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:24.520
ALLISON: Did you hear that?
- I'm sorry.

1160
01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:26.929
The goddamn party.

1161
01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:33.065
BILL: Come on, I... Here, let's
try this one, right over here.

1162
01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:37.899
Mmm.

1163
01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:46.706
This... This is terrific.
It has vodka in it, Bill.

1164
01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.141
A little vodka, right?

1165
01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:50.811
Has that fruity vodka,
that flavored stuff, right?

1166
01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:54.714
Bill, put your lips around this.
It's just out of this world.

1167
01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:58.985
I'm sorry, honey.
You know, I'm no good at this.

1168
01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:01.693
Why don't you choose
whichever cake you'd like?

1169
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.391
I knew you were gonna say that.

1170
01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:07.027
- What?
- I mean you just don't care.

1171
01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:10.630
Oh, why am I doing this? I should
have my head examined again.

1172
01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:11.898
Oh, my God.

1173
01:31:11.899 --> 01:31:18.472
I am trying to throw the party of
the century for my father in two days.

1174
01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.507
- And you just don't give a shit.
- He gives a shit.

1175
01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:23.477
- He doesn't give a shit!
- He does.

1176
01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:26.720
BILL: Allison.
- He does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?

1177
01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:30.752
Come on. Come on.

1178
01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:36.196
- Come on. Smile.
- I'm sorry.

1179
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:42.938
But what should we tell Annie?

1180
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.614
This one.

1181
01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:55.343
He gives a shit.

1182
01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.557
Fantastic.

1183
01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.923
Thank you.

1184
01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:17.604
ALLISON: Mr. Black,
would you care for a piece?
- Yes, I'd love one.

1185
01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:28.780
Have you had a chance to look
at my father's rare books?

1186
01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:33.713
He has Jefferson's
parliamentary manual,

1187
01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:38.418
and this first edition of Bleak House.

1188
01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:40.364
I love your smell.

1189
01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:48.964
Well, I like the way you smell too.

1190
01:32:57.872 --> 01:33:01.683
My mom always used to say that you
could set your heart by that clock.

1191
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:09.684
Could you?

1192
01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:12.889
I never tried.

1193
01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:18.262
Till now.

1194
01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:25.736
Joe?

1195
01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:31.707
May I kiss you?

1196
01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:35.216
Why, yes, you can.

1197
01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:44.287
Thank you.

1198
01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:48.489
You're welcome.

1199
01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:55.997
Joe?

1200
01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:01.229
I don't know who you are.

1201
01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:07.609
I'm Joe.

1202
01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:13.477
And you're Susan.

1203
01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:22.288
And I have this weak
feeling in my knees.

1204
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:26.352
- And is your heart beating strangely?
- Yes.

1205
01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:27.797
Faster.

1206
01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:32.092
The taste of your lips
and the touch of your tongue

1207
01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:34.232
that was wonderful.

1208
01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:43.639
I should...

1209
01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:46.679
I should go home.

1210
01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.582
Shouldn't I?

1211
01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.052
Yeah.

1212
01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:24.718
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

1213
01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.664
Hello, Bill.

1214
01:36:36.056 --> 01:36:37.398
Hello.

1215
01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:46.500
Would you like to join me and
Allison and Quince for a nightcap?

1216
01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:52.044
No. Not right now.

1217
01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:57.149
Okay.

1218
01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:04.361
- Then I'll say good night.
- Good night, Bill.

1219
01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:17.730
- Morning, Quince.
- Top of the morning, B. P.

1220
01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.608
- Hello, Quince.
- Hey!

1221
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:26.039
- Hello, Jennifer.
- Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

1222
01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:29.375
- The board is waiting.
- What? The board?

1223
01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:32.823
- Didn't you call a board meeting?
- No.

1224
01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:47.535
- Good morning.
ALL: Morning, Bill.

1225
01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:51.402
Did you want to have a cup
of coffee or something, Bill?

1226
01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.404
- I don't think so.
- Do you?

1227
01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:02.775
To get to the point, we've received
new information from John Bontecou

1228
01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:05.712
concerning his desires for this
company to merge with his.

1229
01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:08.281
And we wanted to set
the details before you.

1230
01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:09.782
Is that it?

1231
01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:12.218
- Bontecou wants a quick response, and...
- The answer is no.

1232
01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:13.953
Quick enough for you?

1233
01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:15.221
Don't you want to hear the details?

1234
01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:16.990
I'm not interested in the details

1235
01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:19.092
and I'm not interested
in the big picture either.

1236
01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:23.062
What I am interested in is how
my board got convened behind my back

1237
01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.898
and is entertaining a further proposal

1238
01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:28.141
from a man with whom it offends
me to do business.

1239
01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:31.413
I made a decision. Case closed.

1240
01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.841
So am I to understand
from your response

1241
01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:37.443
that you do not want to hear
the details of Bontecou's offer?

1242
01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:39.612
Yes, you are to understand that.

1243
01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:42.582
- And now, may I ask you a question?
- Certainly, Bill.

1244
01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:45.222
Are you running this board, or am I?

1245
01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:51.692
That's it?

1246
01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:57.730
We've got a busy day ahead.
This meeting's already set me behind.

1247
01:38:57.731 --> 01:39:01.434
- Shall we adjourn?
- Before we do, Bill, while we're here...

1248
01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:04.437
There's a second question
the board would like a response to.

1249
01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:06.110
Far simpler one.

1250
01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:10.483
Who is the man standing to your left?

1251
01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:16.549
I've already introduced
Mr. Black to you all.

1252
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:19.252
But who is he?
What are his credentials?

1253
01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:21.289
What is his relationship to you?

1254
01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:30.971
The board is deeply concerned.

1255
01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:35.201
We have reason to believe Mr. Black
is not only influencing your decisions

1256
01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:37.370
in regard to this company,

1257
01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:40.784
but that you are relying on him
to make them for you.

1258
01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:48.081
The lack of response, Bill,
is not appropriate.

1259
01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:49.652
We are your board.

1260
01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.385
We have a right to know how you are

1261
01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.954
managing the operations of this company.

1262
01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:58.992
And, most importantly, that you have not
delegated someone to do it for you.

1263
01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:00.403
Okay?

1264
01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:05.303
One more time. Who is Joe Black?

1265
01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:19.846
A motion has been brought
before the board

1266
01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:22.759
to invoke Article 19
of the corporate charter.

1267
01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:25.219
In English, please.

1268
01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:32.934
Mandatory retirement on
our Chairman's 65th birthday,

1269
01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.936
at which time the Chairman
will be named emeritus.

1270
01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:39.866
You're welcome to attend all meetings

1271
01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:42.902
and will serve as international
spokesman for the corporation.

1272
01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:45.304
Plus, of course, a settlement,

1273
01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:47.273
a golden parachute of such magnitude

1274
01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:49.583
that his feet will
never touch the ground.

1275
01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:53.615
Please indicate
your vote by a yes or no.

1276
01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.549
WOMAN: Yes.
MAN 2: Yes.

1277
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:58.751
MAN 3: Yes.
MAN 4: Yes.

1278
01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:00.219
MAN 5: Yes.
MAN 6: Yes.

1279
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.597
MAN 7: Yes.
MAN 8: Yes.

1280
01:41:03.991 --> 01:41:08.030
- No.
- No.

1281
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:11.736
Motion's passed.

1282
01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:17.970
We will, of course,
delay the announcement

1283
01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:20.773
out of respect
for our former Chairman

1284
01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:23.948
until after the celebration
of his birthday this weekend.

1285
01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:28.347
Well, thanks for allowing me
to save face, Drew.

1286
01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:31.317
The other motion before us is the
acceptance of John Bontecou's offer

1287
01:41:31.318 --> 01:41:34.856
to merge this corporation
with Bontecou lnternational.

1288
01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:52.949
Okay.

1289
01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.643
Joe?

1290
01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:07.030
Who I am

1291
01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:11.058
and what my relationship is
to William Parrish

1292
01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:14.669
will be divulged
in our own good time.

1293
01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:21.212
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Black.

1294
01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:27.607
It's not over till it's over.

1295
01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:30.042
Please, Eddie,
no "fat lady sings" stuff.

1296
01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:34.247
I still sense some doubt in this group.
We could turn it around.

1297
01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:36.249
- You'll be up in the country?
- Yeah.

1298
01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.719
The big celebration of my
mandatory retirement birthday.

1299
01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:41.187
You're an honored guest, Eddie.

1300
01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:44.692
I'm gonna stick it out here.
We still have a shot.

1301
01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:49.003
Get John's office on the phone.
Tell them I'll be there in 20 minutes.

1302
01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:51.870
What did you do?

1303
01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:56.046
- You've gotten the old man fired.
- That we did.

1304
01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:58.571
Thanks to you.

1305
01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:02.341
He was wobbling, mind you,
but you supplied the coup de grâce.

1306
01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:04.410
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

1307
01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:07.118
Quince, you can't unscramble
scrambled eggs.

1308
01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:10.783
I didn't mean to do this.

1309
01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:13.594
Train's left the station, pal,
and you're aboard.

1310
01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:17.294
Now, would you like
to hear the silver lining?

1311
01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:19.694
Check that. Gold.

1312
01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:26.332
Once John Bontecou acquires
Parrish Communications,

1313
01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:31.214
he's gonna break it apart, peddle it
piece by piece to the highest bidder.

1314
01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:35.041
That was the game plan
right from the start.

1315
01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:37.910
I set it up for him, and he
smacks it out of the park.

1316
01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:39.890
Ramifications for you?

1317
01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:43.157
You'll be farting through silk.

1318
01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:48.792
You'll sell your stock.
You'll be positively, truly rich.

1319
01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:51.359
You can stop kissing ass.

1320
01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:54.901
What'll it feel like to be a man?

1321
01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.466
I'm going to expose you.

1322
01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:04.337
Okay. Go right ahead.

1323
01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:08.286
You tell William Parrish how you
betrayed him in a secret board meeting.

1324
01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:12.751
Tell Allison how you helped
her father lose his company.

1325
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:18.493
It's just life, Quincie.

1326
01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:21.498
Wake up and smell the thorns.

1327
01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:02.205
- You're here.
- I am.

1328
01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:06.866
I just dropped by.

1329
01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:12.078
I thought I'd scrounge some lunch.
I was in the neighborhood.

1330
01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:14.206
I'm so glad.

1331
01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:19.247
When I called, they said that you
and Dad had already left the office.

1332
01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:22.485
He's taking a nap.

1333
01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.293
Yeah.

1334
01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:32.665
Well, he must be tired.

1335
01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:39.298
You know, this whole Bontecou thing...
It seems...

1336
01:45:39.299 --> 01:45:43.008
Yes, he's tired. I believe so.

1337
01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:45.140
Yeah.

1338
01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:55.048
You must be hungry then.

1339
01:45:58.051 --> 01:46:01.259
No. Not anymore.

1340
01:46:04.358 --> 01:46:05.893
Are you?

1341
01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:28.620
SUSAN: I loved making love to you.

1342
01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:36.864
It was like making love with someone
making love for the first time.

1343
01:51:41.594 --> 01:51:43.164
Thank you.

1344
01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:50.280
Do you like making love with me?

1345
01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:55.477
Yes.

1346
01:51:57.944 --> 01:52:01.948
- More than you love peanut butter?
- Yes.

1347
01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:04.361
Much more.

1348
01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:21.742
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. I'm here.

1349
01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:27.148
- For how long?
- I hope a long, long time.

1350
01:52:30.243 --> 01:52:31.619
Me too.

1351
01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:41.697
What do we do now?

1352
01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:53.143
It'll come to us.

1353
01:53:24.731 --> 01:53:28.872
Hello, Bill.
Did you have a nice nap?

1354
01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:35.478
- I couldn't sleep.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1355
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:38.545
I'll come down.

1356
01:53:42.148 --> 01:53:43.991
What's going on?

1357
01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:51.390
- I saw you kiss Susan.
- Yes, I saw you see me.

1358
01:53:51.391 --> 01:53:54.426
You're at the wrong place at the
wrong time with the wrong woman.

1359
01:53:54.427 --> 01:53:56.995
- I'll be the judge of that.
- I'm her father.

1360
01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:59.765
With all due respect, Bill,
I'm not asking your permission.

1361
01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:01.870
You goddamn well should!

1362
01:54:12.946 --> 01:54:17.583
You walk into my life. You give me
the worst news a guy can get.

1363
01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:20.385
You have me dancing on heads of pins
with my business, my family.

1364
01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:22.254
- Now you're spooning with my daughter?
- "Spooning"?

1365
01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:23.755
Yes!

1366
01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:26.592
And stop repeating everything
I say and turning it into a question.

1367
01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:29.903
Spooning, fooling around
and God knows what.

1368
01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:33.131
Oh, you arrive on the scene...

1369
01:54:33.132 --> 01:54:36.435
Why you picked me
I still don't understand.

1370
01:54:36.436 --> 01:54:43.183
I chose you for your verve, your
excellence and your ability to instruct.

1371
01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:47.890
You've lived a first-rate life,
and I find it eminently usable.

1372
01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:52.822
What do you want?

1373
01:54:58.458 --> 01:55:01.393
Everybody wants something, Joe.

1374
01:55:01.394 --> 01:55:04.431
You've been taking me
from pillar to post here.

1375
01:55:06.699 --> 01:55:10.647
And I thought I knew who you were,
and it wasn't a lot of fun.

1376
01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:13.976
But it was almost bearable.

1377
01:55:14.507 --> 01:55:19.786
But now I'm getting something else
from you, something very, very strange.

1378
01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:23.815
What is it that you want?

1379
01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:27.052
I'm only living the Parrish bywords,

1380
01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:29.499
looking for that "ounce of excitement,"

1381
01:55:29.656 --> 01:55:33.968
that "whisper of a thrill there is
no sense living your life without."

1382
01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:36.766
You know what I mean, Bill?

1383
01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:43.001
You're violating
the laws of the universe.

1384
01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:47.211
- This universe?
- Any universe that exists or ever existed.

1385
01:55:47.874 --> 01:55:52.945
You may be the pro, Joe,
but I know who you are,

1386
01:55:52.946 --> 01:55:55.016
and you're all fucked up.

1387
01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:02.125
I don't like your tone,
and I don't like your references.

1388
01:56:02.889 --> 01:56:04.595
And I don't give a shit.

1389
01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:06.825
Perhaps it's time to remind you

1390
01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:09.928
this is not simply a dispute
with a putative suitor.

1391
01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:13.877
This is me. So be careful, Bill.

1392
01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:17.314
Cut all that "Bill" crap out,
you son of a bitch.

1393
01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:20.707
I'll say it again. Be careful, Bill.

1394
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:34.119
Can I help you?
Excuse me, can I help you?

1395
01:56:34.387 --> 01:56:37.527
Yes. Dr. Parrish, please.

1396
01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:40.169
She comes on at 6:00.

1397
01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.048
Hi.

1398
01:56:57.443 --> 01:56:59.923
- Where's Joe?
- Joe?

1399
01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:04.287
Joe's not around.

1400
01:57:06.886 --> 01:57:10.492
- Do you know where he is?
- I don't know.

1401
01:57:13.593 --> 01:57:15.868
Why are you looking for Joe?

1402
01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:20.709
Love. Passion. Obsession.

1403
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.878
All those things
you told me to wait for.

1404
01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:26.617
- They've arrived.
- This is crazy.

1405
01:57:29.175 --> 01:57:30.619
Why?

1406
01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:34.484
A man shows up,
almost never leaves your side.

1407
01:57:34.647 --> 01:57:39.152
Well, you clearly trust him,
depend on him.

1408
01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:42.621
So why aren't those things
good enough for me?

1409
01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:44.189
You don't know anything about Joe.

1410
01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:45.924
What are you afraid of, Dad?

1411
01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:48.701
That I'll fall
head over heels for Joe?

1412
01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:54.000
Well, I have.
Just like you did with Mom.

1413
01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:57.135
Isn't that what you've
always wanted for me?

1414
01:57:57.136 --> 01:57:58.615
Susan...

1415
01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:04.620
I don't think
Joe is gonna be with us long.

1416
01:58:06.546 --> 01:58:09.925
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

1417
01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:13.919
- I can't say.
- Oh, come on.

1418
01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.720
The guy's working with you.

1419
01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:18.457
You always know chapter and verse
about everyone working with you.

1420
01:58:18.458 --> 01:58:20.528
In this case I can't. I...

1421
01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:26.967
I only will tell you that with Joe,
you're on very, very dangerous ground.

1422
01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:38.582
- I love him.
- I don't care if you love him!

1423
01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:41.083
I'm telling you!

1424
01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:53.964
Joe's no good for you.

1425
01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:59.074
Of course not, Daddy.

1426
01:59:00.166 --> 01:59:01.645
I'm sorry.

1427
01:59:06.706 --> 01:59:08.276
I love you too.

1428
01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:44.515
Mr. Bad News.
About time you show up.

1429
01:59:48.447 --> 01:59:50.551
Don't be feisty, sister.

1430
01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:53.726
I'm not feisty, mister.

1431
01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:57.858
You come for me? That's good news.

1432
01:59:59.358 --> 02:00:01.599
No, I come to see the doctor.

1433
02:00:02.195 --> 02:00:03.901
Doctor?

1434
02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:08.271
- What could be wrong with you?
- Nothing.

1435
02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:14.306
You come to see doctor lady?

1436
02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:17.049
- Yeah, man.
- My doctor lady?

1437
02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:20.621
Mine too, you know.

1438
02:00:24.817 --> 02:00:26.455
You're in love?

1439
02:00:33.092 --> 02:00:34.866
You're loved back?

1440
02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:45.109
She know your real self?

1441
02:00:46.572 --> 02:00:50.141
- She know how she feel.
- Backside.

1442
02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:52.811
What the hell
kind of business this is.

1443
02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:54.814
Don't need you okaying.

1444
02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:59.918
Schoolboy things in your head.
Badness for you.

1445
02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:01.987
Badness for her.

1446
02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:07.692
Badness for me, lying here,
tumor big as a breadfruit,

1447
02:01:07.693 --> 02:01:12.335
poisoning me inside, and waiting.

1448
02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:16.268
Bring you flowers, and all
I's getting is aggravation.

1449
02:01:16.269 --> 02:01:19.437
The only flowers I want to see

1450
02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:24.342
is the ones over my peaceful
self resting in the dirt.

1451
02:01:24.343 --> 02:01:27.612
Can't do no right by people.
Come to take you, you want to stay.

1452
02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:30.958
Leave you stay,
you want to go. Rahtid.

1453
02:01:33.619 --> 02:01:36.497
You're not in
your right place, mister.

1454
02:01:38.291 --> 02:01:40.031
Me neither.

1455
02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:42.364
No more.

1456
02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:45.973
Take me, and you come with me now.

1457
02:01:56.575 --> 02:01:58.782
But I not lonely here.

1458
02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:04.854
Somebody want me here.

1459
02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:11.063
It nice it happen to you.

1460
02:02:12.358 --> 02:02:16.135
Like you come to the island
and had a holiday.

1461
02:02:18.364 --> 02:02:22.971
Sun didn't burn you red-red, just brown.

1462
02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:27.142
You sleep, and no mosquito eat you.

1463
02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:34.422
But the truth is, it bound to happen
if you stay long enough.

1464
02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:41.558
So take that nice picture you got
in your head home with you,

1465
02:02:43.055 --> 02:02:45.728
but don't be fooled.

1466
02:02:50.596 --> 02:02:53.702
We lonely here mostly too.

1467
02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:57.235
If we lucky,

1468
02:02:57.236 --> 02:03:03.778
maybe we got some nice pictures
to take with us.

1469
02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:31.538
You got enough nice pictures?

1470
02:03:35.641 --> 02:03:37.279
Yes.

1471
02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:33.835
Good-bye, sister.

1472
02:04:58.424 --> 02:04:59.800
Yes?

1473
02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:03.131
I have the feeling, all in all,

1474
02:05:04.997 --> 02:05:09.309
what I made this voyage for
has served its purpose.

1475
02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:16.208
What are you saying?
It's time to go?

1476
02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:24.588
I'm ready.

1477
02:05:26.519 --> 02:05:30.262
- You are?
- Yeah.

1478
02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:39.035
Good. Tomorrow. After the party.

1479
02:06:09.662 --> 02:06:12.030
- Yes, Helen?
- Telephone call, sir.

1480
02:06:12.031 --> 02:06:14.732
- Mr. Sloane from New York.
- Thank you.

1481
02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:16.678
Excuse me.

1482
02:06:27.379 --> 02:06:28.858
Thank you.

1483
02:06:34.153 --> 02:06:35.495
Hey!

1484
02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.430
Hey.

1485
02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:42.628
Red or white?

1486
02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:46.164
- No. No, thank you.
- Come on, have a drink.

1487
02:06:46.165 --> 02:06:49.236
- You look like you need one as bad as me.
- I do?

1488
02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:54.512
Quince?

1489
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:59.348
I find myself a little confused.

1490
02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:05.583
- Confused, huh?
- Yes.

1491
02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:07.652
- About what?
- Love.

1492
02:07:07.653 --> 02:07:08.927
Love.

1493
02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:13.964
Oh, man.
I got problems of my own.

1494
02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:20.700
- You love Allison, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

1495
02:07:21.367 --> 02:07:23.141
How did you meet?

1496
02:07:24.837 --> 02:07:26.509
Well,

1497
02:07:27.272 --> 02:07:31.743
I was this world-class loser,
and she was this happy little rich girl,

1498
02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:34.588
and for some reason she took me in.

1499
02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:38.453
But Allison loves you.

1500
02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:52.333
How do you know?

1501
02:07:57.403 --> 02:08:00.645
Because she knows the worst thing
about me, and it's okay.

1502
02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:05.276
- What is it?
- No, it's not one thing.
It's just an idea, Joe.

1503
02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:06.756
It's just...

1504
02:08:09.915 --> 02:08:13.863
It's like you know
each other's secrets,

1505
02:08:15.354 --> 02:08:19.358
your deepest, darkest secrets.

1506
02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:24.403
- Deepest, darkest secrets?
- Yeah, and then you're free.

1507
02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:26.839
Free?

1508
02:08:27.399 --> 02:08:33.604
You're free! You're free to love
each other completely, totally.

1509
02:08:33.605 --> 02:08:35.709
Just no fear.

1510
02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:40.985
So there's nothing you don't know
about each other, and it's okay.

1511
02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:57.302
- Do you like me, Joe?
- Oh, yes, Quince.

1512
02:08:58.197 --> 02:09:00.336
You're one of my favorites.

1513
02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:09.283
What would you say if you knew it was
me who brought down Bill Parrish?

1514
02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:17.648
Oh, I told Drew and the board
that Bill depended on you.

1515
02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:20.585
Drew and Bontecou are gonna chop up
the company, sell it off for parts.

1516
02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:22.954
Bontecou was outside.
Drew was Mr. Inside.

1517
02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:27.096
And I was the fool
who made it all happen.

1518
02:09:31.296 --> 02:09:32.502
Oh...

1519
02:09:33.832 --> 02:09:35.311
God.

1520
02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:48.248
- What do I do?
- Go to Bill Parrish
and tell him the truth.

1521
02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:51.187
He'll forgive you.

1522
02:09:54.119 --> 02:09:56.599
- You think so?
- Yes.

1523
02:09:59.925 --> 02:10:04.396
- You think I should wait
till after the party?
- No.

1524
02:10:07.533 --> 02:10:08.739
No.

1525
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:14.338
Four down here
and a sturgeon up there.

1526
02:10:14.339 --> 02:10:16.774
This one is perfect. Absolutely.

1527
02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:20.415
Okay, I think I want
four here like that...

1528
02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:23.114
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

1529
02:10:23.115 --> 02:10:24.821
What do you think?

1530
02:10:25.517 --> 02:10:28.986
Well, it's...
It's starting to grow on me.

1531
02:10:28.987 --> 02:10:33.424
Oh, I've got a baritone
with a balalaika coming

1532
02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:35.526
from the Russian Tea Room.

1533
02:10:35.527 --> 02:10:37.528
I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt,

1534
02:10:37.529 --> 02:10:39.633
and he'll be singing Nelson Eddy songs.

1535
02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:41.575
Wow.

1536
02:10:43.502 --> 02:10:45.447
You really are amazing.

1537
02:10:45.838 --> 02:10:49.080
But why, oh, why, Allison,
are you doing all this?

1538
02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:58.157
I do it because I love you,
because everybody loves you.

1539
02:10:58.717 --> 02:11:02.528
Mommy, wherever she is, Susan, Quince,

1540
02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:07.628
all the people you work with,
anyone who's ever met you.

1541
02:11:10.128 --> 02:11:11.732
Oh, Daddy.

1542
02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:15.534
After all, you've been
a wonderful father.

1543
02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:23.174
Yeah, well, I haven't been
the father to you that...

1544
02:11:23.175 --> 02:11:25.810
- That you've been to Susan?
- I wasn't going to say that.

1545
02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:29.622
But that's what you were thinking.
And that's okay.

1546
02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:32.016
Because I know that you love me.

1547
02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:34.793
I mean, it's not like it is with her.

1548
02:11:35.487 --> 02:11:39.257
Whenever she walks into the room,
your eyes light up.

1549
02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:42.534
She always gets a smile
from you, as opposed to me.

1550
02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:44.468
When I walk in,

1551
02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:49.307
this look comes over your face, like,
"What does she want now?"

1552
02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:53.371
But you've never let
either of us want for anything.

1553
02:11:53.372 --> 02:11:56.216
Oh, God. More than that,
Daddy, more than that.

1554
02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:05.786
I've felt loved,
and that's all that matters.

1555
02:12:06.518 --> 02:12:09.954
So, never mind favorites.

1556
02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:12.056
You're allowed to have one.

1557
02:12:12.057 --> 02:12:14.503
The point is, you've been mine.

1558
02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:20.041
Oh, Allison.

1559
02:12:27.706 --> 02:12:29.708
I really feel

1560
02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:33.946
I've everything I could've ever
wanted for my birthday.

1561
02:12:35.213 --> 02:12:37.715
Oh, wait a minute!

1562
02:12:37.716 --> 02:12:42.062
There's more to come.
Lots of excess, like you love.

1563
02:12:43.655 --> 02:12:47.796
You know, this is gonna be
a wonderful party.

1564
02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:51.700
Yes, it is.

1565
02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:58.637
Thank you. Thank you.

1566
02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.877
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks.

1567
02:13:29.735 --> 02:13:32.069
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1568
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.049
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

1569
02:13:39.177 --> 02:13:41.054
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1570
02:13:42.014 --> 02:13:44.790
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Simone. How are you?

1571
02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:52.232
- Hi, darling.
- Oh, hi, Gene. Hi.

1572
02:14:20.252 --> 02:14:23.164
My father told me
you might be leaving.

1573
02:14:24.222 --> 02:14:26.167
Your father and I...

1574
02:14:27.426 --> 02:14:31.465
Our time together
has come to an end.

1575
02:14:41.039 --> 02:14:44.918
I'm in love with a man,

1576
02:14:46.511 --> 02:14:51.619
but I don't know who he is,
where he's going or when.

1577
02:14:54.586 --> 02:14:56.827
I can tell you the when part.

1578
02:14:58.156 --> 02:14:59.635
Tonight.

1579
02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:08.540
- So it does get worse.
- No worse than it gets for me.

1580
02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:15.976
I'm in love with a woman who

1581
02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:24.720
I don't wanna leave.

1582
02:15:28.787 --> 02:15:30.322
Then don't.

1583
02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:37.130
There's so little
we know about each other.

1584
02:15:38.563 --> 02:15:40.898
There's so much
I should tell you.

1585
02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:44.107
That'll come. That'll come.

1586
02:15:48.406 --> 02:15:49.714
Will it?

1587
02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:57.750
I wanna be with you, Joe.

1588
02:16:06.892 --> 02:16:09.894
I opened my big mouth
one too many times.

1589
02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:12.705
Everything just got all twisted.

1590
02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:15.608
It's okay, Quince.
I understand.

1591
02:16:16.034 --> 02:16:19.174
You've always meant well,
and I appreciate that.

1592
02:16:19.404 --> 02:16:21.406
Sometimes things
just turn out wrong.

1593
02:16:22.507 --> 02:16:23.542
Yeah?

1594
02:16:25.977 --> 02:16:28.512
- Excuse me.
- No, no. Joe, come in.

1595
02:16:28.513 --> 02:16:29.880
I wanna thank you.

1596
02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:32.583
- Is it okay, Bill?
- Sure.

1597
02:16:32.584 --> 02:16:35.119
Joe knows the whole story.
I told him.

1598
02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.221
And it was his idea
that I come clean.

1599
02:16:37.222 --> 02:16:40.024
I mean, I wanted to come clean,

1600
02:16:40.025 --> 02:16:44.528
but he gave me a pair of balls,
you know what I mean?

1601
02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:46.406
Yeah, I believe I do.

1602
02:16:52.103 --> 02:16:53.877
Anyway,

1603
02:16:56.141 --> 02:16:58.842
- I can see you guys got business.
- No.

1604
02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:02.446
However, I do have
some unfinished business with Drew.

1605
02:17:02.447 --> 02:17:05.416
Get him on the helicopter.
Get him out here tonight.

1606
02:17:05.417 --> 02:17:07.952
I wanna tell this guy
how I feel about him face-to-face.

1607
02:17:07.953 --> 02:17:09.220
That could be a tall order, B. P.

1608
02:17:09.221 --> 02:17:13.726
I doubt if Drew is anxious
to see you face-to-face.

1609
02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:22.276
- I'll deliver the package.
- Okay.

1610
02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:38.351
- How are you doing?
- What the hell do you care?

1611
02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:41.057
Just asking, Bill.

1612
02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:45.956
You wanna know? I'll tell you.

1613
02:17:45.957 --> 02:17:47.591
You're looking at a man
who is not walking

1614
02:17:47.592 --> 02:17:49.493
through the valley
of the shadow of death.

1615
02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:51.061
He's galloping into it.

1616
02:17:51.062 --> 02:17:53.664
At the same time, the business
he built with his own hands and head

1617
02:17:53.665 --> 02:17:55.866
has been commandeered
by a couple of cheap pirates.

1618
02:17:55.867 --> 02:18:00.042
Oh, yes! I almost forgot. My daughter's
fallen in love with Death.

1619
02:18:00.372 --> 02:18:02.909
And I'm in love with your daughter.

1620
02:18:05.777 --> 02:18:07.312
Say again?

1621
02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:13.083
I'm in love with your daughter,

1622
02:18:13.084 --> 02:18:15.120
and I'm taking her with me tonight.

1623
02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:19.690
- You what?
- I think you heard me, Bill.

1624
02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:22.092
You're not taking Susan anywhere.
What does that mean, anyway?

1625
02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:24.937
- I thought we had a deal.
- And I'm sorry.

1626
02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:31.502
Susan's my daughter. She has
a wonderful life ahead of her.

1627
02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:35.272
You're gonna deprive her of it,
and you're telling me you're sorry?

1628
02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:37.174
I'm sorry. Apology not accepted.

1629
02:18:37.175 --> 02:18:40.622
I don't care, Bill. I love her.

1630
02:18:42.213 --> 02:18:44.056
How perfect for you

1631
02:18:45.383 --> 02:18:48.352
to take whatever you want
because it pleases you.

1632
02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:50.059
That's not love.

1633
02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:52.429
Then what is it?

1634
02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:57.131
Some aimless infatuation which,
for the moment, you feel like indulging.

1635
02:18:58.563 --> 02:19:01.134
It's missing everything that matters.

1636
02:19:01.433 --> 02:19:05.069
- Which is what?
- Trust, responsibility,

1637
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:07.071
taking the weight
for your choices and feelings

1638
02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:09.707
and spending the rest of your life
living up to them,

1639
02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:13.610
and above all, not hurting
the object of your love.

1640
02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:16.213
So that's love
according to William Parrish?

1641
02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:18.982
Multiply it by infinity
and take it to the depth of forever,

1642
02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:22.553
and you will still have barely
a glimpse of what I'm talking about.

1643
02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:25.625
- Those were my words.
- They're mine now.

1644
02:19:27.359 --> 02:19:32.062
Bill, Susan wants to come with me.
She loves me.

1645
02:19:32.063 --> 02:19:33.598
She loves you?

1646
02:19:33.932 --> 02:19:36.800
Who is you?
Did you tell her who you are?

1647
02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:39.975
- No.
- Does she know where she's going? Huh?

1648
02:19:42.474 --> 02:19:45.876
You see, Susan went for
that poor son of a bitch

1649
02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:49.146
whose body you took, and everything
since has been aftermath.

1650
02:19:49.147 --> 02:19:51.048
You say you love her,
but you don't know what love is.

1651
02:19:51.049 --> 02:19:53.016
She loves you,
but she doesn't know who you are.

1652
02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:57.121
You make a deal, you're breaking it.
Bottom line is, Joe,

1653
02:19:57.122 --> 02:20:00.090
you're swindling her soul, and you're
doing it with your eyes wide open.

1654
02:20:00.091 --> 02:20:01.325
I don't like what you're saying.

1655
02:20:01.326 --> 02:20:03.861
I'm past caring
what you like and don't.

1656
02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:05.629
You're stealing my daughter,
and I'm not gonna let you.

1657
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:07.698
- You're not?
- No.

1658
02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:10.611
- Are you threatening me?
- Yeah, I certainly hope so.

1659
02:20:11.403 --> 02:20:12.574
Yeah.

1660
02:20:16.441 --> 02:20:18.242
I loved Susan
from the moment she was born,

1661
02:20:18.243 --> 02:20:20.577
and I love her now
and every minute in between.

1662
02:20:20.578 --> 02:20:23.180
And what I dream of is a man
who will discover her,

1663
02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:25.082
and that she will discover a man
who will love her,

1664
02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:28.185
who is worthy of her,
who is of this world, of this time,

1665
02:20:28.186 --> 02:20:30.587
and has the grace, compassion
and fortitude to walk beside her

1666
02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:32.656
as she makes her way through life.

1667
02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:34.033
Enough!

1668
02:20:37.128 --> 02:20:40.164
What I know is what I want,
and what I want is Susan.

1669
02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:42.433
And I will have her,
and she will have me.

1670
02:20:42.434 --> 02:20:44.635
And that's the way
it's going to be.

1671
02:20:44.636 --> 02:20:46.672
And there's nothing you can do.

1672
02:20:49.841 --> 02:20:52.276
Why did you tell me all this, Joe?

1673
02:20:52.277 --> 02:20:54.311
You're the big shot,
the biggest shot of all.

1674
02:20:54.312 --> 02:20:57.047
You don't have to ask permission,
but that's what you're doing.

1675
02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:58.348
Do you know why?

1676
02:20:58.349 --> 02:21:00.884
Because you've somehow
developed into a good guy,

1677
02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:03.297
and you know this is all wrong.

1678
02:21:04.222 --> 02:21:08.826
I don't know what you're gonna do,
but how can this be love?

1679
02:21:08.827 --> 02:21:11.068
She doesn't know who you are.

1680
02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:14.809
Why don't you tell her,
try it out, see what happens?

1681
02:21:15.867 --> 02:21:17.968
Reveal everything there is
to know about yourself

1682
02:21:17.969 --> 02:21:20.642
and let the chips fall
where they may.

1683
02:21:24.075 --> 02:21:25.679
Okay?

1684
02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:32.521
I've given it my best shot. I...

1685
02:21:34.185 --> 02:21:36.562
I wish I could tell you
to sleep on it.

1686
02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:04.515
- I'm sorry. Would you excuse me?
- Sure.

1687
02:22:04.516 --> 02:22:07.360
- Okay, nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1688
02:22:24.235 --> 02:22:26.703
There's something
so indescribably sexy

1689
02:22:26.704 --> 02:22:29.480
about you standing
in the middle of a crowd.

1690
02:22:29.741 --> 02:22:32.346
I could make love to you right here.

1691
02:22:44.589 --> 02:22:46.223
You're trying to tell me my future,

1692
02:22:46.224 --> 02:22:48.363
you're looking on the wrong side.

1693
02:22:53.898 --> 02:22:56.537
There is something
I do want to tell you.

1694
02:23:05.209 --> 02:23:06.949
But you can't?

1695
02:23:13.918 --> 02:23:16.660
Just now when you hesitated,
I got a chill.

1696
02:23:19.657 --> 02:23:24.162
Remember that morning in the coffee shop?
When you said,

1697
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:30.269
"What's wrong with taking care of a woman?
She takes care of you."

1698
02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:34.513
Did I say that?

1699
02:23:35.073 --> 02:23:38.918
And I said you'd have a hard time
finding a woman like that these days.

1700
02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:46.421
Well, you found one, Joe.

1701
02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:50.629
The coffee shop.

1702
02:23:51.789 --> 02:23:56.670
That was the place,
and you were the guy.

1703
02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.000
And you said that...

1704
02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:07.909
That you didn't want me to be your doctor
because you didn't want me to examine you.

1705
02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:12.748
Why, I got to examine you, after all.

1706
02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:26.162
I could come with you.

1707
02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:31.803
You want me to wait?

1708
02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:34.675
You'll come back?

1709
02:24:42.106 --> 02:24:43.744
May I kiss you?

1710
02:25:11.335 --> 02:25:13.439
That felt like good-bye.

1711
02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:21.749
What's going on, Joe?

1712
02:25:23.314 --> 02:25:25.623
I feel like we're lifting off.

1713
02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:31.595
I'm still here.

1714
02:25:37.161 --> 02:25:39.106
But you're not.

1715
02:25:41.699 --> 02:25:43.678
You're somewhere else.

1716
02:26:20.972 --> 02:26:22.917
You're someone else.

1717
02:26:27.545 --> 02:26:29.615
Don't you want to ask who?

1718
02:26:31.983 --> 02:26:34.759
- Yes, but...
- But?

1719
02:26:42.593 --> 02:26:44.504
Joe, I'm afraid.

1720
02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:50.143
- Afraid to find out?
- Don't be.

1721
02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:54.477
It doesn't matter what I am.

1722
02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:58.114
You know who I am.

1723
02:27:08.419 --> 02:27:16.419
You're...

1724
02:27:42.887 --> 02:27:44.422
You're Joe.

1725
02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:54.540
Yes, I'm Joe.

1726
02:28:03.474 --> 02:28:04.975
And I promise you,

1727
02:28:08.946 --> 02:28:12.484
you will always have what you
found in the coffee shop.

1728
02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:25.498
Tell me that you love me.
Tell me that you love me now.

1729
02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:28.001
I love you now.

1730
02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:31.369
I'll love you always.

1731
02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:38.878
Susan.

1732
02:28:40.578 --> 02:28:42.216
Yes?

1733
02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:47.825
Thank you for loving me.

1734
02:29:18.115 --> 02:29:21.095
We should think
about getting started, Bill.

1735
02:29:31.595 --> 02:29:33.631
It'll just be us.

1736
02:29:38.135 --> 02:29:40.137
Thank you.

1737
02:29:48.145 --> 02:29:49.624
Bill?

1738
02:29:50.581 --> 02:29:51.957
Come in.

1739
02:29:54.852 --> 02:29:58.356
I got him. The helicopter
will be here in two minutes.

1740
02:29:59.757 --> 02:30:03.932
- How are we on time?
- Okay.

1741
02:30:04.628 --> 02:30:06.107
Get him in here.

1742
02:30:07.698 --> 02:30:09.905
- May?
MAY: Yes, sir?

1743
02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:12.302
I know you're busy,
but I want you to put in a call

1744
02:30:12.303 --> 02:30:13.803
to Eddie Sloane for me.

1745
02:30:13.804 --> 02:30:16.409
- At home, sir?
- No, he's at the office.

1746
02:30:17.875 --> 02:30:19.752
This is damn big of Bill.

1747
02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:21.978
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1748
02:30:21.979 --> 02:30:24.114
Also smart, you know?

1749
02:30:24.115 --> 02:30:27.951
Well, he had no choice. He knows
you're a formidable adversary.

1750
02:30:27.952 --> 02:30:29.452
- He said that?
- Yeah, I mean,

1751
02:30:29.453 --> 02:30:31.287
you got him by the short hairs.

1752
02:30:31.288 --> 02:30:33.324
Yeah, the short and gray hairs.

1753
02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:36.535
EDDIE: We're all here, Bill.
- I appreciate this, Eddie.

1754
02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:41.498
Members of the board, this will
just take a minute of your time.

1755
02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:43.433
As custodians of the company,

1756
02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:46.202
you may receive information
from what follows

1757
02:30:46.203 --> 02:30:50.082
that will be valuable
to you or not.

1758
02:30:51.242 --> 02:30:53.611
- Either way, thanks.
- We're all ears.

1759
02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.213
Thanks.

1760
02:30:58.649 --> 02:31:00.253
Good evening, Bill.

1761
02:31:00.651 --> 02:31:02.419
Thank you, Quince.

1762
02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:07.657
I just wanted to say how appreciative
I am of this grand gesture.

1763
02:31:07.658 --> 02:31:09.637
Shut up and sit down.

1764
02:31:15.666 --> 02:31:18.034
You're a useless sack of shit, Drew.

1765
02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:19.602
You played footsie with John Bontecou

1766
02:31:19.603 --> 02:31:23.373
so you could dismember my company
to line your own pockets.

1767
02:31:23.374 --> 02:31:25.475
- I don't know where you get that idea.
- The board agreed...

1768
02:31:25.476 --> 02:31:27.444
The board didn't know
you were a mole

1769
02:31:27.445 --> 02:31:30.113
who burrowed inside
so you could bury us all.

1770
02:31:30.114 --> 02:31:33.216
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?
Another one of his whoppers?

1771
02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:34.884
Aren't you sick of this
asshole lurking around?

1772
02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:36.419
Nobody knows who he is.

1773
02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:38.054
But one thing everybody does know,

1774
02:31:38.055 --> 02:31:42.425
he somehow got your ear and has been
pouring poison into it ever since.

1775
02:31:42.426 --> 02:31:44.428
You're the poison, Drew.

1776
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:48.465
You've operated behind the scenes
to suborn the trust of a man

1777
02:31:48.466 --> 02:31:53.069
who has stamped you with his imprimatur
of class, elegance, and stature.

1778
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:57.073
I've had the opportunity to be witness
to every kind and degree of deception.

1779
02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:59.042
But Bill Parrish
has been on the receiving end

1780
02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:00.844
of machinations so Machiavellian

1781
02:32:00.845 --> 02:32:02.946
that it has rarely been
my experience to encounter.

1782
02:32:02.947 --> 02:32:07.050
And yet, he has combated them
stoically and selflessly,

1783
02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:09.385
without revealing my identity.

1784
02:32:09.386 --> 02:32:14.390
Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took,
his task would have been far easier.

1785
02:32:14.391 --> 02:32:16.871
He could have turned
defeat into victory.

1786
02:32:17.394 --> 02:32:20.430
But he is too honorable a man
to have done that.

1787
02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:25.702
Because of me, he has lost his work,
his company, his reputation.

1788
02:32:25.703 --> 02:32:29.082
So now, given these losses,

1789
02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:34.053
I'm compelled to end
the need for secrecy.

1790
02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:38.887
The time has come
to tell you who I am.

1791
02:32:44.889 --> 02:32:47.657
So tell me. Tell me.
I'm peeing in my pants.

1792
02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:50.727
And you're going to pee some more.
Joe, don't do this.

1793
02:32:50.728 --> 02:32:53.363
It's okay, Bill. It's time
we put this person in his place.

1794
02:32:53.364 --> 02:32:56.099
It's not necessary, Joe.
Drew's gonna step aside.

1795
02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:58.668
- I'm not stepping anywhere.
- I appreciate your gentlemanliness.

1796
02:32:58.669 --> 02:33:01.337
But what we need to do here
is drive the dagger home.

1797
02:33:01.338 --> 02:33:03.306
- "The dagger"?
- I told you to shut up!

1798
02:33:03.307 --> 02:33:05.013
Prepare yourself, Drew.

1799
02:33:06.844 --> 02:33:09.212
- I...
- Joe, please.

1800
02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:11.047
Bill, kindly let me take it from here.

1801
02:33:11.048 --> 02:33:12.788
- am...
- Don't.

1802
02:33:17.254 --> 02:33:19.859
An agent for
the Internal Revenue Service.

1803
02:33:28.132 --> 02:33:29.770
- Bill?
- Huh?

1804
02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:31.675
Bill.

1805
02:33:34.238 --> 02:33:35.808
- Bill.
- Yeah.

1806
02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.112
Yes, he's...

1807
02:33:39.777 --> 02:33:43.079
He's an agent for
the Internal Revenue Service.

1808
02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:46.182
Yes, we were convinced
that Bontecou, on past deals,

1809
02:33:46.183 --> 02:33:48.084
has structured
his mergers and acquisitions

1810
02:33:48.085 --> 02:33:52.658
in suspicious and complicated ways so as
to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.

1811
02:33:52.957 --> 02:33:55.258
The agency asked Bill for his cooperation

1812
02:33:55.259 --> 02:33:57.568
in an undercover investigation of Bontecou.

1813
02:33:58.028 --> 02:33:59.996
We wanted to go after him,

1814
02:33:59.997 --> 02:34:03.137
and this deal gave us
that perfect opportunity.

1815
02:34:04.068 --> 02:34:07.538
- And I offered to cooperate.
- And we're very grateful.

1816
02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:10.907
Agent Joe Black here...

1817
02:34:10.908 --> 02:34:13.009
Of course, that's not his real name,

1818
02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:15.278
smelled out your involvement, Drew.

1819
02:34:15.279 --> 02:34:19.515
He developed evidence you were
working both sides of the fence.

1820
02:34:19.516 --> 02:34:23.653
Unfortunately, that is what is known
as a conflict of interest.

1821
02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:25.555
Undisclosed conflict of interest.

1822
02:34:25.556 --> 02:34:27.790
- An offense.
- An indictable offense.

1823
02:34:27.791 --> 02:34:30.601
- And a likely conviction.
- Very likely.

1824
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:35.431
- I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer.
BILL: No lawyers, Drew.

1825
02:34:35.432 --> 02:34:37.800
We're gonna offer you a deal.

1826
02:34:37.801 --> 02:34:40.770
Confess to the board every detail
of your participation,

1827
02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:43.183
then submit your resignation.

1828
02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:46.452
- What do I get?
- You get not to go to jail.

1829
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:48.144
You're talking through your hat.

1830
02:34:48.145 --> 02:34:50.413
You're offering me a deal
because you've got no proof.

1831
02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:53.850
- Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
- He's talking through his lips.

1832
02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:56.388
Drew, make no mistake.

1833
02:34:56.654 --> 02:34:58.988
Should you choose to test
my resolve in this matter,

1834
02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:01.324
you will be looking at an outcome
that will have a finality

1835
02:35:01.325 --> 02:35:03.429
that is beyond your comprehension.

1836
02:35:04.094 --> 02:35:06.863
And you will not be counting the days
or the months or the years,

1837
02:35:06.864 --> 02:35:10.174
but millenniums in a place with no doors.

1838
02:35:14.471 --> 02:35:16.245
All right, you win.

1839
02:35:17.474 --> 02:35:19.375
Soon as I get back to the city,
I'll meet with the board.

1840
02:35:19.376 --> 02:35:21.144
EDDIE: You're meeting
with the board right now, Drew.

1841
02:35:21.145 --> 02:35:23.046
Resignation accepted.

1842
02:35:23.047 --> 02:35:27.083
Moreover, I propose a motion
to reconfirm William Parrish

1843
02:35:27.084 --> 02:35:29.452
as Chairman of the board
of Parrish Communications,

1844
02:35:29.453 --> 02:35:33.022
as well as a rejection of the merger
with Bontecou International.

1845
02:35:33.023 --> 02:35:34.290
How say you, board?

1846
02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:35.458
MAN 1: Yes.
MAN 2: Yes.

1847
02:35:35.459 --> 02:35:36.626
MAN 3: Yes.
MAN 4: Yes.

1848
02:35:36.627 --> 02:35:37.727
MAN 5: Yes.
MAN 6: Yes.

1849
02:35:37.728 --> 02:35:39.228
MAN 7: Yes.
MAN 8: Yes.

1850
02:35:39.229 --> 02:35:40.697
EDDIE: The motion is passed.

1851
02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:42.231
Thank you. That's great.

1852
02:35:42.232 --> 02:35:45.068
But it's more than I bargained for.
I just wanted to set the record straight.

1853
02:35:45.069 --> 02:35:46.202
You have.

1854
02:35:46.203 --> 02:35:50.006
Sounds like these guys want you back, Bill.
We'll get their apologies later.

1855
02:35:50.007 --> 02:35:53.910
Meanwhile, enjoy your party. Celebrate.
I'll attend to the nasty details.

1856
02:35:53.911 --> 02:35:56.512
And Mr. Black, may we say thank you?

1857
02:35:56.513 --> 02:35:59.682
My pleasure.
This is an IRS agent's dream.

1858
02:35:59.683 --> 02:36:02.220
I'll be promoted
chief of section off this.

1859
02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:10.732
Who would have believed it?

1860
02:36:11.695 --> 02:36:13.868
You an IRS agent?

1861
02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:18.105
Death and taxes.

1862
02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:31.280
ALL: Happy birthday to you

1863
02:36:31.281 --> 02:36:35.351
Happy birthday to you

1864
02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:40.456
Happy birthday dear William

1865
02:36:40.457 --> 02:36:46.134
Happy birthday to you

1866
02:37:28.439 --> 02:37:31.886
ALL: Speech! Speech! Speech!

1867
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:35.881
Speech! Speech! Speech!

1868
02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:38.887
Thank you.

1869
02:37:41.084 --> 02:37:43.186
I thought I was gonna
sneak away tonight.

1870
02:37:43.187 --> 02:37:44.825
ALL: No!

1871
02:37:48.425 --> 02:37:50.336
What a glorious night.

1872
02:37:51.328 --> 02:37:53.774
Every face I see is a memory.

1873
02:37:54.765 --> 02:37:57.677
It may not be
a perfectly perfect memory.

1874
02:37:59.736 --> 02:38:03.308
Sometimes we had our ups and downs.

1875
02:38:04.741 --> 02:38:09.451
But we're all together,
and you're mine for a night.

1876
02:38:13.283 --> 02:38:17.526
And I'm gonna break precedent
and tell you my one candle wish.

1877
02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:22.497
That you would have a life
as lucky as mine,

1878
02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:27.068
where you can wake up
one morning and say,

1879
02:38:28.465 --> 02:38:30.842
"I don't want anything more."

1880
02:38:39.877 --> 02:38:41.686
Sixty-five years.

1881
02:38:43.614 --> 02:38:45.821
Don't they go by in a blink?

1882
02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:31.464
Hi.

1883
02:39:34.631 --> 02:39:36.132
What a night.

1884
02:39:36.767 --> 02:39:38.803
I'm having a hell of a time.

1885
02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:46.781
You were right, about Joe. He...

1886
02:39:49.346 --> 02:39:51.291
He is going somewhere.

1887
02:39:52.716 --> 02:39:54.195
I'm sorry.

1888
02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:58.521
You relieved?

1889
02:40:00.223 --> 02:40:03.294
Yes, but...

1890
02:40:04.127 --> 02:40:05.833
But what?

1891
02:40:12.135 --> 02:40:15.071
I want you to know
how much I love you,

1892
02:40:15.072 --> 02:40:18.849
that you've given a meaning to my life
that I had no right to expect,

1893
02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:21.277
that no one can ever take from me.

1894
02:40:21.278 --> 02:40:23.189
- Dad...
- No!

1895
02:40:24.348 --> 02:40:26.452
I love you so much.

1896
02:40:28.318 --> 02:40:30.695
And I want you
to promise me something.

1897
02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:35.057
I don't want you
to ever worry about me.

1898
02:40:35.058 --> 02:40:38.562
And if anything should happen,
I'm gonna be okay.

1899
02:40:39.796 --> 02:40:43.566
And everything's gonna be all right.
And I have no regrets.

1900
02:40:43.567 --> 02:40:46.172
And I want you
to feel the same way.

1901
02:40:53.243 --> 02:40:54.813
I love you, Daddy.

1902
02:40:55.579 --> 02:40:57.456
That's why it's okay.

1903
02:41:03.487 --> 02:41:04.863
No regrets?

1904
02:41:07.524 --> 02:41:09.059
No regrets.

1905
02:41:09.493 --> 02:41:12.269
- That's a good feeling, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1906
02:41:17.968 --> 02:41:20.072
Everybody's saying good-bye.

1907
02:41:22.773 --> 02:41:24.445
I'm still here.

1908
02:41:27.511 --> 02:41:29.991
Would you like to dance
with me, Susan?

1909
02:41:32.516 --> 02:41:34.051
Yeah.

1910
02:41:40.223 --> 02:41:43.592
If you don't mind dancing
with an old fogey like me.

1911
02:41:43.593 --> 02:41:48.371
Oh, Dad, you're not old.

1912
02:41:52.235 --> 02:41:54.180
You'll never be old.

1913
02:42:00.644 --> 02:42:04.091
- Can I get you anything, sir?
- No.

1914
02:42:05.882 --> 02:42:08.385
Do you have any peanut butter?

1915
02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:11.526
I don't think so, sir.

1916
02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:17.130
- Thank you anyway.
- You're welcome.

1917
02:43:57.327 --> 02:43:58.965
What's that?

1918
02:44:01.131 --> 02:44:04.806
The fireworks are starting.
Let's go down and watch.

1919
02:44:09.439 --> 02:44:13.509
- Shall we?
- You go on ahead, honey.

1920
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:15.512
I'm just gonna catch my breath.

1921
02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:25.865
Okay.

1922
02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:45.751
Okay.

1923
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:03.929
- Happy birthday, Bill.
- Thank you.

1924
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:11.765
- Did you say good-bye?
- Not exactly.

1925
02:46:12.662 --> 02:46:17.702
- I guess you have your reasons.
- Yes.

1926
02:46:26.443 --> 02:46:28.711
Now that we have a moment,
would you mind if I expressed

1927
02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:31.124
my gratitude
for what you did for Susan?

1928
02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:38.189
I've never heard her speak of
any man as she spoke of you.

1929
02:46:39.055 --> 02:46:41.660
That's what I always wanted for her.

1930
02:46:44.494 --> 02:46:46.633
But what happens to her now?

1931
02:46:48.498 --> 02:46:50.637
I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.

1932
02:46:51.601 --> 02:46:53.978
These things have
a way of working out.

1933
02:46:57.774 --> 02:47:00.686
Would you mind
if I expressed my gratitude?

1934
02:47:03.013 --> 02:47:07.791
For you, for the time
you've given me,

1935
02:47:08.385 --> 02:47:10.091
for the person you are.

1936
02:47:12.655 --> 02:47:17.797
Don't blow smoke up my ass.
You'll ruin my autopsy.

1937
02:47:29.773 --> 02:47:32.378
It's hard to let go, isn't it?

1938
02:47:35.478 --> 02:47:37.218
Yes, it is, Bill.

1939
02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:41.390
Well, that's life.

1940
02:47:42.485 --> 02:47:44.396
What can I tell you?

1941
02:48:19.889 --> 02:48:21.561
Should I be afraid?

1942
02:48:23.593 --> 02:48:25.367
Not a man like you.

1943
02:49:57.587 --> 02:49:59.122
You're here.

1944
02:50:04.594 --> 02:50:05.936
You bet.

1945
02:50:10.166 --> 02:50:15.172
- Well, where did you go?
- I don't know.

1946
02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:26.688
I don't...
I don't know, you know. I...

1947
02:50:29.452 --> 02:50:32.057
It's all kind of blurred up
and hazy, but...

1948
02:50:35.325 --> 02:50:39.364
Would you know what I mean if I said
I don't think I'll ever figure it out?

1949
02:50:43.266 --> 02:50:45.040
But now I'm back.

1950
02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:52.242
That's it?

1951
02:50:56.779 --> 02:51:00.556
Well, I don't know what else to say.
Looks like a hell of a party.

1952
02:51:03.586 --> 02:51:05.087
You think so?

1953
02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:10.168
You look beautiful.

1954
02:51:12.562 --> 02:51:15.063
When you disappeared
around the corner,

1955
02:51:15.064 --> 02:51:18.204
I wasn't sure if I was ever
gonna see you again.

1956
02:51:31.614 --> 02:51:33.320
Hey, are you all right?

1957
02:51:41.924 --> 02:51:44.529
- The coffee shop.
- Yep.

1958
02:51:46.029 --> 02:51:47.462
I asked you
if I said something wrong

1959
02:51:47.463 --> 02:51:50.239
and you said "No,"
it was so right it scared you.

1960
02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:52.374
And then you said...

1961
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:58.778
Forgive me for saying this,
but it's been with me ever since.

1962
02:52:01.844 --> 02:52:03.550
What has?

1963
02:52:05.448 --> 02:52:07.359
You said you liked me.

1964
02:52:11.421 --> 02:52:14.094
- No.
- You didn't?

1965
02:52:15.958 --> 02:52:21.032
I said...
I liked you so much.

1966
02:52:33.976 --> 02:52:36.149
We know so little about each other.

1967
02:52:39.315 --> 02:52:41.089
But we've got time.

1968
02:52:43.953 --> 02:52:45.659
Yeah.

1969
02:52:55.131 --> 02:52:58.134
I wish you

1970
02:53:01.704 --> 02:53:04.184
could've known my father.

1971
02:53:06.476 --> 02:53:13.816
Me too.

1972
02:53:21.391 --> 02:53:23.336
What do we do now?

1973
02:53:27.764 --> 02:53:31.712
- It'll come to us.
- Yeah.
