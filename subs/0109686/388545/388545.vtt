1
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.575
Excuse me.

2
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.170
Could you tell me how to get
to the medical school?

3
00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.681
I'm supposed to be doing a lecture
in about 20 minutes,

4
00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.580
and my driver's
a bit lost.

5
00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.450
You go straight ahead,

6
00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:57.785
and, uh, you make a left
over the bridge.

7
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.518
That's a lovely accent
you have.

8
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.462
- New Jersey?
- Austria.

9
00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:08.227
Austria! Ha ha!
Well, then...

10
00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.462
G'day, mate.

11
00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:15.436
Let's put another
shrimp on the barbie.

12
00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.567
Let's not.

13
00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.046
Oh.

14
00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.284
Now, who's got
the wiener schnitzel?

15
00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.765
Beautiful.
There you go, Dolf.

16
00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.199
There you go, buddy.
Yeah.

17
00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:50.758
Let's see.

18
00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.363
<i>Next, we got
roast beef au jus.</i>

19
00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.233
<i>Who's got
the roast beef au jus?</i>

20
00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:59.301
<i>Stella, beautiful.
Bon appetit, Stella.</i>

21
00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.142
<i>Oui oui, yeah.</i>

22
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.341
Walk away.
Go on. Go on.

23
00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.112
Last but not least...
foot-long!

24
00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:09.143
Who's got the foot-long?

25
00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.281
There you...
very funny, rascal.

26
00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:13.518
Very funny.
In your dreams.

27
00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.460
<i>Harry, why haven't you
dropped those dogs off at the show yet?</i>

28
00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:19.157
Uh, sir, I didn't
want to send them

29
00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.132
to a performance
on an empty stomach, sir.

30
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.760
<i>- Get a move on it!
- Yes, sir.</i>

31
00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.134
Mutt cutts.
10-4.

32
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.158
Whew.

33
00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:49.126
Suck me sideways.

34
00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:05.437
Hello.
How are you?

35
00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.806
Uh-uh-uh... uh...
uh-uh-uh...

36
00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.680
I'll be out
in one minute.

37
00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.853
Ow.

38
00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.513
Why are you going
to the airport?

39
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.415
Flying somewhere?

40
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.885
How'd you guess?

41
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.387
I saw your luggage.

42
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.389
Then when I noticed
the airline ticket,

43
00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:53.391
I put two and two
together.

44
00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:55.359
So where're you headed?

45
00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:56.861
Aspen.

46
00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:58.886
Mmm... California.

47
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.126
Beautiful.

48
00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:06.702
Name's Christmas,
Lloyd Christmas.

49
00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:08.933
I'm Mary Swanson.

50
00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:11.943
This isn't my real job,
you know.

51
00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:14.241
- No?
- Nope, my friend Harry and I

52
00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.474
are saving up our money
to open our own pet store.

53
00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:18.745
That's nice.

54
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.652
- I got worms.
- I beg your pardon?

55
00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:25.851
That's what we're going to call it...
I Got Worms.

56
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:28.325
We're going to specialize
in selling worm farms,

57
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.692
<i>you know,
like ant farms.</i>

58
00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:34.356
What's the matter?

59
00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.663
A little tense
about the flight?

60
00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:39.566
Something like that.

61
00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.233
There's really nothing
to worry about, Mary.

62
00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:44.504
Statistically,
they say you're more likely

63
00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:46.443
<i>to get killed
on the way to the airport,</i>

64
00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:48.912
you know, like in a head-on crash
or flying off a cliff

65
00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:50.881
or getting trapped
under a gas truck...

66
00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:52.850
That's the worst.
I have this cousin...

67
00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:54.512
<i>well, I had this cousin.</i>

68
00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:57.716
Lloyd, could you keep
your eyes on the road, please?

69
00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:59.723
Oh. Yeah.

70
00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:01.521
Good thinking.

71
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.391
Can't be too careful.

72
00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:05.658
A lot of bad drivers
out there.

73
00:06:11.603 --> 00:06:13.969
Hey, watch it!

74
00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:24.645
Okay, gang,
you know the rules...

75
00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:26.810
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing heinies.

76
00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:31.312
Where have you been? My dogs were
supposed to be here 40 minutes ago!

77
00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:33.324
Now I hardly have any time
to primp them.

78
00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:35.622
Don't worry about a thing,
Mrs. Neugy-burger.

79
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.458
- Neugeboren!
- Neug-neug-neug...

80
00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:38.929
- Boren!
- Boren.

81
00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:40.898
These pooches aren't going to
need any primping.

82
00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.560
You know why?
I'll tell you why.

83
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.865
Because I bathed them
and I clipped them myself.

84
00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:47.667
And I stand by
my performance.

85
00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.580
<i>You know,
on second thought,</i>

86
00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.882
<i>you might just want to run
a comb through 'em.</i>

87
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.152
<i>The white zone is for the immediate</i>

88
00:07:03.187 --> 00:07:04.385
<i>The white zone is for the immediate</i>

89
00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.891
<i>loading and unloading
of passengers only.</i>

90
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:09.086
<i>No parking.</i>

91
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:13.359
Thanks.
Here you go.

92
00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:15.866
Oh no, Mary.

93
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.233
I couldn't possibly
accept that,

94
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.670
not after all
we've been through.

95
00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:25.375
Thank you, Lloyd.

96
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.777
- Uh, good luck with your worms.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:30.714
Hey.

98
00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:33.714
How about a hug?

99
00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:35.515
<i>The white zone
is for the immediate</i>

100
00:07:35.554 --> 00:07:38.751
<i>loading and unloading

101
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.621
<i>No parking.</i>

102
00:07:46.898 --> 00:07:48.763
Oh.

103
00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:52.997
I hate goodbyes.

104
00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:54.596
Oh.

105
00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:01.269
Uh, Lloyd...

106
00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.474
Shh!

107
00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:05.506
Just go.

108
00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.166
Be strong.

109
00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.852
<i>Mr. Dan Mitchell,</i>

110
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.358
<i>please pick up
the white courtesy phone.</i>

111
00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:51.522
<i>Mr. Dan Mitchell, please pick up
the white courtesy phone...</i>

112
00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:54.930
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

113
00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:58.595
- You make the pickup.
- Piece of cake.

114
00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:10.207
ugh!

115
00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:17.822
Hi!

116
00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:20.825
<i>Passenger Maura Tadge,</i>

117
00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:23.384
<i>please pick up
the white courtesy phone.</i>

118
00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:24.918
<i>You have a message.</i>

119
00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:27.158
<i>Passenger Maura Tadge.</i>

120
00:09:32.804 --> 00:09:34.795
Agh! Mary!

121
00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:38.839
<i>There's our payday.</i>

122
00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:41.903
She left it.
Let's go.

123
00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:45.246
Excuse me!
Coming through!

124
00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:50.649
Move it or lose it,
sister!

125
00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:55.993
Hey!

126
00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:00.497
<i>Eenie...</i>

127
00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:02.932
<i>meenie... minie...</i>

128
00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:05.266
mo!

129
00:10:12.043 --> 00:10:14.011
Hold that plane!

130
00:10:14.045 --> 00:10:16.707
Sir, you can't
go in there!

131
00:10:16.748 --> 00:10:18.010
It's okay!

132
00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:20.210
I'm a limo driver!

133
00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:27.123
Agh!

134
00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.684
Whew...

135
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.042
Hi, Lloyd.

136
00:10:50.081 --> 00:10:51.708
Hi, Harry.

137
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.583
- How was your day?
- Not bad.

138
00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:56.985
Fell off
the jetway again.

139
00:11:02.494 --> 00:11:04.052
Who the hell you figure

140
00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:05.995
this guy's
working for, anyway?

141
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:08.090
I don't know.

142
00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:13.095
We sure as hell
better find out.

143
00:11:16.975 --> 00:11:18.602
The ulcer?

144
00:11:18.643 --> 00:11:20.611
I'll live.

145
00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:31.749
- So you got fired again, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

146
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.124
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident, you know?

147
00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:39.962
Yeah, well,
I lost my job too.

148
00:11:39.998 --> 00:11:44.799
Man! You are
one pathetic loser.

149
00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:47.771
No offense.

150
00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:50.001
No. None taken.

151
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.101
Ha ha ha!

152
00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:57.137
<i>You know what really
chaffs my ass, though?</i>

153
00:11:57.182 --> 00:11:58.979
I spent my life's savings

154
00:11:59.017 --> 00:12:00.814
turning my van
into a dog.

155
00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:02.843
Hi, Petey!

156
00:12:03.054 --> 00:12:05.249
The alarm alone
cost me 200.

157
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.281
Hey!
Chicks love it.

158
00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:09.316
<i>It's a shaggin' wagon.</i>

159
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.591
What's with
the briefcase?

160
00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.130
It's a love memento.

161
00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:19.966
The most beautiful
woman alive,

162
00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:22.303
I drove her
to the airport.

163
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.309
Sparks flew,
emotions ran high.

164
00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:27.777
She actually
talked to me, man.

165
00:12:27.812 --> 00:12:29.939
Get outta here.

166
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:32.973
Oh, yeah yeah.
Tractor beam...

167
00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:36.283
Sucked me right in.

168
00:12:36.321 --> 00:12:39.290
Anyway...

169
00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:41.292
She left this
in the terminal

170
00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:43.988
and flew to Aspen
and out of my life.

171
00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:46.054
What's in it?

172
00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:50.432
Man... I would
have to be a lowlife

173
00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:53.835
to go rootin' around in somebody else's
private property.

174
00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:57.239
- Is it locked?
- Yeah, really well.

175
00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:07.749
<i>There's two of them.
One of them's got a gun.</i>

176
00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.687
Did you pay
the gas bill?

177
00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:15.022
Hey...

178
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.358
Do you realize what you've done?

179
00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:19.329
I'm sorry.
I say we bail.

180
00:13:19.364 --> 00:13:21.594
Okay.

181
00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:31.134
Briefcase ain't here.

182
00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:33.872
They must have
taken it with them.

183
00:13:33.912 --> 00:13:35.880
Well, he's got to
come home sometime.

184
00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:37.404
Maybe we should
trash the place,

185
00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:39.542
send him
a little message.

186
00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:43.486
I don't think he's going to get
that message, Joe.

187
00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:45.853
I mean, the guy's got worms
in his living room.

188
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.051
Well.

189
00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:50.561
Oh, I got
a better idea.

190
00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:56.128
"I thought I taw
a puddy cat.

191
00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:57.930
I did. I did."

192
00:14:13.418 --> 00:14:15.909
I can't believe
we drove around all day

193
00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:18.787
and there's not
a single job in this town.

194
00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:20.950
There is nothing,
nada, zip!

195
00:14:20.992 --> 00:14:23.790
Yeah, unless you want
to work 40 hours a week.

196
00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:25.261
Pfft!

197
00:14:25.296 --> 00:14:27.423
Here. I'm going to
go to the store.

198
00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:29.330
Okay, just get
the bare essentials.

199
00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:31.164
This is the last
of our dough.

200
00:14:31.202 --> 00:14:33.796
Hey. What do I
look like?

201
00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:12.105
Cripes!

202
00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:22.147
Excuse me,
little old lady.

203
00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:29.959
Uh, do you have
change for a dollar?

204
00:15:29.994 --> 00:15:31.518
Change?

205
00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:33.428
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.

206
00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.490
Oh... well, uh,

207
00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:38.502
could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff here

208
00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:40.265
while I go
break a dollar?

209
00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:42.637
- Of course.
- Thanks.

210
00:15:42.674 --> 00:15:45.871
Hey. I guess
they're right.

211
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.468
Senior citizens,

212
00:15:47.512 --> 00:15:50.037
although slow and dangerous
behind the wheel,

213
00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:52.914
can still serve
a purpose.

214
00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:56.216
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me!

215
00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:04.417
- Ugh!
- Where's the booze?

216
00:16:04.462 --> 00:16:07.295
I got robbed
by a sweet old lady

217
00:16:07.332 --> 00:16:09.892
on a motorized cart.

218
00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:12.095
I didn't even
see it coming.

219
00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.900
Oh...

220
00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:15.929
- Harry?
- No...

221
00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:18.204
- No...
- Harry. Come on, Harry.

222
00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:19.972
Cheer up.

223
00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:22.070
It gets worse, Lloyd.

224
00:16:22.113 --> 00:16:24.047
My parakeet Petey...

225
00:16:24.082 --> 00:16:27.142
- Yeah?
...he's dead.

226
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:31.579
Aw...

227
00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:33.557
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, Harry.

228
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:35.582
What happened?

229
00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:38.596
His head fell off.

230
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.530
His head fell off?

231
00:16:40.565 --> 00:16:42.931
Yeah, he was pretty old.

232
00:16:46.237 --> 00:16:47.602
Ugh!

233
00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.573
That's it.

234
00:16:49.607 --> 00:16:52.075
I've had it
with this dump!

235
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.045
We got no food.
We got no jobs.

236
00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:57.048
Our pets' heads are falling off!

237
00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:59.016
Okay, just calm down!

238
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.382
What the hell are we
doing here, Harry?

239
00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:03.546
We gotta get
out of this town!

240
00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:06.148
Yeah? And go where?
Where are we gonna go?

241
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:09.058
I'll tell you where,

242
00:17:09.093 --> 00:17:10.993
someplace warm...

243
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:13.327
a place where the beer
flows like wine,

244
00:17:13.364 --> 00:17:15.457
where beautiful women
instinctively flock

245
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.798
like the salmon
of Capistrano.

246
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.434
I'm talking about
a little place called...

247
00:17:21.472 --> 00:17:24.202
Aspen.

248
00:17:24.242 --> 00:17:27.405
I don't know, Lloyd.
The French are assholes.

249
00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:29.879
Wait a minute.

250
00:17:32.116 --> 00:17:34.448
Wait a minute!
I know what you're up to, mister.

251
00:17:34.485 --> 00:17:37.181
Yeah! You just
wanna go to Aspen

252
00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.656
and find that girl
who lost her briefcase,

253
00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:42.057
<i>and you need me
to drive you there!</i>

254
00:17:42.093 --> 00:17:44.459
- Right? Am I right?
- Yeah. So?

255
00:17:44.495 --> 00:17:47.896
- Am I right? Am I right?
- Yeah! So?

256
00:17:47.932 --> 00:17:50.196
So I wanna go someplace
where we know somebody

257
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.203
who can plug us into
the social pipeline.

258
00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.535
No! No no no!
No, Lloyd!

259
00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:57.370
No! I say we stay here,
we hunt for jobs,

260
00:17:57.408 --> 00:18:00.002
and we keep saving our money
for the worm store!

261
00:18:00.044 --> 00:18:02.308
<i>I don't know about you,</i>

262
00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.008
but I am getting
sick and tired

263
00:18:04.048 --> 00:18:05.515
of-of running
from creditors!

264
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.179
You know what I'm sick
and tired of, Harry?

265
00:18:11.055 --> 00:18:14.684
I'm sick and tired of having to
eke my way through life.

266
00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:21.258
I'm sick and tired
of being a nobody.

267
00:18:22.567 --> 00:18:24.694
<i>But most of all...</i>

268
00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:32.204
I'm sick and tired
of having nobody.

269
00:18:34.545 --> 00:18:36.570
Okay, Lloyd.

270
00:18:40.251 --> 00:18:42.412
Aspen it is.

271
00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:48.048
You'd better not
be foolin'.

272
00:18:54.098 --> 00:18:57.067
Okay okay,

273
00:18:57.101 --> 00:18:59.126
just let it out.
Have a good cry.

274
00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.138
Come on.

275
00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:02.969
Okay.

276
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.612
Okay, that's enough.

277
00:19:45.283 --> 00:19:47.148
Lloyd,
what are you doing?

278
00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:49.380
It feels like you're running
at an incredible rate, Harry.

279
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.547
Would you quit it?
We're not even through Connecticut yet,

280
00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:52.783
and already
you're annoying me.

281
00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.315
- Sorry.
- Jeez.

282
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.557
<i>- We're really doing it, aren't we?
- Yeah.</i>

283
00:19:59.564 --> 00:20:01.191
Hey, where'd
you get those?

284
00:20:01.232 --> 00:20:04.668
I bought them
when we filled up.

285
00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:06.727
Well...
We're supposed to talk

286
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:08.534
about all
expenditures, Lloyd.

287
00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:10.404
We're on a very
tight budget.

288
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:12.671
This didn't come out
of our travel fund.

289
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.177
Oh.

290
00:20:14.212 --> 00:20:16.112
No, I was able to raise
25 extra bucks

291
00:20:16.147 --> 00:20:18.513
before we left.

292
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:20.779
Where did you get
25 extra bucks?

293
00:20:20.818 --> 00:20:24.049
I sold some stuff
to Billy in 4C.

294
00:20:24.088 --> 00:20:26.488
The blind kid?

295
00:20:26.524 --> 00:20:28.617
Yeah!

296
00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:30.354
Yeah.

297
00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.829
What did you
sell him, Lloyd?

298
00:20:34.432 --> 00:20:36.195
Stuff.

299
00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:39.692
- What kind of stuff?
- I don't know.

300
00:20:39.737 --> 00:20:41.830
A few baseball cards,
a sack of marbles...

301
00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:44.034
Petey.

302
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.544
Petey?

303
00:20:47.578 --> 00:20:50.479
You sold my dead bird
to a blind kid?

304
00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:53.678
Lloyd, that-that...
what are you...

305
00:20:53.718 --> 00:20:56.209
Petey didn't even
have a head!

306
00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:59.587
Harry,
I took care of it.

307
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.328
Pretty bird.

308
00:21:04.362 --> 00:21:06.159
Yeah. Can you say,
"pretty bird"?

309
00:21:06.197 --> 00:21:07.755
Pretty bird.

310
00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:10.427
Yes, pretty bird.

311
00:21:10.468 --> 00:21:12.561
Pretty bird.

312
00:21:15.873 --> 00:21:17.898
Polly want a cracker?

313
00:21:21.612 --> 00:21:23.239
Those rat bastards.

314
00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.408
They're rubbing it
right in our faces.

315
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.441
Man, Andre'll have
a goddamn hemorrhage

316
00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:29.282
if we don't get
that briefcase back.

317
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.345
They must have been
following us for weeks.

318
00:21:31.389 --> 00:21:34.586
- Why you say?
- "Gas Man."

319
00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:37.287
How the hell do
they know that I got gas?

320
00:21:37.328 --> 00:21:39.421
They gotta be pros.

321
00:21:40.798 --> 00:21:43.562
Don't worry.
We're going to get that money back.

322
00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:47.263
And I'll tell you
something else,

323
00:21:47.305 --> 00:21:49.296
they ain't never
getting to Aspen.

324
00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.604
I'm going to see to that.

325
00:21:57.248 --> 00:21:59.239
<i>They got The Monkees.</i>

326
00:21:59.283 --> 00:22:01.342
They were a major influence
on The Beatles.

327
00:22:01.385 --> 00:22:03.683
Yeah, I know.

328
00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:06.881
<i>Excuse me, Flo?</i>

329
00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:17.965
Flo, like the TV show.

330
00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:22.473
Uh... what is
the "soup du jour"?

331
00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.168
It's the soup of the day.

332
00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:25.869
Mm-hmm...

333
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.037
That sounds good.
I'll have that.

334
00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.611
Anything else
before I leave the area?

335
00:22:31.649 --> 00:22:33.412
No... yeah...

336
00:22:33.451 --> 00:22:35.316
yes yes,
my soda's flat.

337
00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:37.651
It doesn't have
any bubbles.

338
00:22:44.862 --> 00:22:46.625
Happy now?

339
00:22:50.868 --> 00:22:53.666
Feels good to mingle
with these laid-back country folk,

340
00:22:53.704 --> 00:22:57.765
don't it, Harr?
I like it a lot.

341
00:22:59.343 --> 00:23:02.471
- Uh-oh.
- What? What's the matter?

342
00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:08.313
You spilled the salt,
that's what's the matter.

343
00:23:08.352 --> 00:23:11.378
Spilling the salt
is very bad luck.

344
00:23:11.422 --> 00:23:13.447
We're driving
across the country.

345
00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:15.652
The last thing we need
is bad luck.

346
00:23:15.693 --> 00:23:19.185
Quick. Toss some salt
over your right shoulder.

347
00:23:24.535 --> 00:23:27.993
Uh-oh, too little
too late, Harry.

348
00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:34.272
Who's the dead man
that hit me with the salt shaker?

349
00:23:43.854 --> 00:23:46.288
<i>Well... uh...</i>

350
00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:47.848
it was a terrible
mistake, sir.

351
00:23:47.892 --> 00:23:50.292
Please, believe me.
I would never do anything

352
00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:51.852
to offend a man
of your size.

353
00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:54.160
Kick his ass,
Sea Bass!

354
00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.825
You gonna eat that?

355
00:23:58.869 --> 00:24:00.564
What? That?
No... yes... no.

356
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:02.596
Well... no,
it crossed my mind.

357
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.699
Yeah.

358
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:20.552
Still want it?

359
00:24:20.591 --> 00:24:23.583
Nah, you go ahead.

360
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:31.996
You really
wimped out, man.

361
00:24:32.036 --> 00:24:34.027
What are you talking about,
wimped out?

362
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:37.040
Well-well, did you...
the guy hawked on my burger!

363
00:24:37.074 --> 00:24:39.304
Hey, wait a second.

364
00:24:39.343 --> 00:24:41.607
I think I just...

365
00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:44.638
Yeah...
I just had an idea.

366
00:24:48.986 --> 00:24:51.216
Follow me.

367
00:24:52.957 --> 00:24:55.050
Whew.

368
00:24:58.062 --> 00:24:59.893
<i>Excuse me. Guys?</i>

369
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.625
What the hell
do you want?

370
00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:05.033
Uh... I just want
to apologize

371
00:25:05.069 --> 00:25:06.866
for that uh...
unpleasant scene

372
00:25:06.904 --> 00:25:08.599
a little earlier.

373
00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:12.040
My friend Harry and I
would, uh...

374
00:25:12.076 --> 00:25:14.408
like to buy
you guys a...

375
00:25:14.445 --> 00:25:16.436
round of beers...

376
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.380
just to bury
the hatchet.

377
00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:20.646
Make it
four boilermakers.

378
00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:22.585
Whatever you want, sir.

379
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.612
I'll have the waitress
bring it over immediately.

380
00:25:27.124 --> 00:25:29.422
Lloyd, what are you doing?

381
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.621
We can't afford
to buy them drinks.

382
00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:36.693
Um... excuse me.

383
00:25:36.734 --> 00:25:40.602
Sea Bass and the fellas
offered to pick up our check.

384
00:25:40.638 --> 00:25:43.163
They said just put it
on their tab.

385
00:25:44.508 --> 00:25:46.032
They're very nice.

386
00:25:47.044 --> 00:25:49.035
Sea Bass said that?

387
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.480
Well, if uh...

388
00:25:51.515 --> 00:25:54.245
that guy at the table
over there is Sea Bass.

389
00:25:58.656 --> 00:26:00.886
Ah! Uh.

390
00:26:01.892 --> 00:26:04.588
All right,
if that's what he wants.

391
00:26:05.596 --> 00:26:07.564
Put these
on there too, okay?

392
00:26:07.598 --> 00:26:09.964
You got it.

393
00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:17.936
I'm gonna kill
those sons of bitches!

394
00:26:23.013 --> 00:26:25.538
That was genius, Lloyd,
sheer genius!

395
00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:27.915
I mean, where did you come up
with a scam like that?

396
00:26:27.952 --> 00:26:31.718
- Saw it in a movie once.
- That was incredible!

397
00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:34.190
So what happened?
So the guy tricks some sucker

398
00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:37.126
into picking up his tab,
then gets away with it scot-free?

399
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:40.790
No, in the movie, they catch up to him
a half-mile down the road

400
00:26:40.831 --> 00:26:44.028
and slit his throat.
It was a good one!

401
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.962
Wow.

402
00:26:49.006 --> 00:26:51.907
<i>- Harry?
- What?</i>

403
00:26:51.942 --> 00:26:53.876
I know this isn't
the best time, but...

404
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:56.141
<i>- when you get a chance to pull over...
- Yeah?</i>

405
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.909
- I gotta pee.
- What, are you crazy?

406
00:26:57.948 --> 00:26:59.575
I'm not pulling over now.

407
00:26:59.617 --> 00:27:01.585
But I gotta go!
What am I supposed to do?

408
00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:04.850
Well-well, whiz in one of the empty beer
bottles in the back.

409
00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:07.517
They're on the floor.
Just get one of...

410
00:27:07.558 --> 00:27:10.049
- Jeez, Lloyd!
- Quit moving around!

411
00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:12.653
Huh! What...

412
00:27:12.696 --> 00:27:14.664
Shit!

413
00:27:16.934 --> 00:27:18.663
<i>- Watch the seat! Watch the seat!
- Okay!</i>

414
00:27:18.702 --> 00:27:21.404
All right!

415
00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:26.808
Ahh...

416
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.575
Ahh...

417
00:27:29.613 --> 00:27:33.606
- Uh-oh.
- What? What's wrong?

418
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.983
The bottle's almost full
and I'm still going.

419
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.989
- So stop going.
- I can't stop going once I've started.

420
00:27:39.023 --> 00:27:40.957
It stings.

421
00:27:40.991 --> 00:27:42.515
Quick! Get me
another bottle.

422
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.788
- What?
- Come on.

423
00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:45.455
Hurry hurry hurry
hurry hurry hurry!

424
00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:47.054
Come on! Come on!

425
00:27:47.097 --> 00:27:49.429
Okay okay, here
here here. Hold it!

426
00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:56.873
- Hold that.
- Jesus.

427
00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:03.743
Hold that one.

428
00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:05.510
Hurry.
I'm pinching it.

429
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:07.483
What are you,
a camel?

430
00:28:10.554 --> 00:28:14.752
Pull over!

431
00:28:18.095 --> 00:28:20.359
- Huh?
- Pull over!

432
00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:24.593
No, it's a cardigan,
but thanks for noticing.

433
00:28:24.635 --> 00:28:27.661
Yeah.
Killer boots, man!

434
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:31.368
Pull your vehicle
to the side of the road!

435
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.380
License and registration,
please.

436
00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.057
You fellas were going a little fast back
there, wouldn't you say?

437
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.690
You, uh...
you fellas been doing

438
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.562
a bit of boozing,
have you?

439
00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:58.227
Sucking back on Grandpa's
old cough medicine?

440
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:59.600
No. Oh no, sir.

441
00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:01.002
- No no no.
- No, huh-uh.

442
00:29:01.038 --> 00:29:03.939
Yeah, well,
what's that?

443
00:29:05.609 --> 00:29:08.043
- That's nothing, sir.
- Yeah, nothing.

444
00:29:08.078 --> 00:29:11.138
Yeah well, you aware that
it's against the law

445
00:29:11.181 --> 00:29:12.978
to have an open
alcohol container

446
00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:14.848
here in the State
of Pennsylvania?

447
00:29:14.885 --> 00:29:16.250
<i>Come on,
give me that booze,</i>

448
00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:18.619
<i>you little pumpkin-pie-
haircutted freak!</i>

449
00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:20.317
<i>Come on!</i>

450
00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:29.896
Sir, no, I- I...

451
00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:31.561
<i>No, sir, don't.
Don't drink...</i>

452
00:29:31.602 --> 00:29:33.160
You'd keep
your mouth shut

453
00:29:33.203 --> 00:29:35.364
if you knew what was
good for you, buddy.

454
00:29:51.622 --> 00:29:52.987
<i>Tic Tac, sir?</i>

455
00:29:53.023 --> 00:29:55.116
Get the hell
outta here!

456
00:29:59.763 --> 00:30:03.665
<i>How could they not
have gotten the ransom?</i>

457
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.293
It just doesn't
make sense.

458
00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:08.328
I left the money exactly where they
instructed me to.

459
00:30:08.372 --> 00:30:10.135
<i>Oh, it makes
perfect sense, Mary.</i>

460
00:30:10.174 --> 00:30:12.005
We should have called
the authorities

461
00:30:12.042 --> 00:30:13.839
the minute we knew
that Bobby was kidnapped.

462
00:30:13.877 --> 00:30:15.708
Now, Helen, we've been
through this already.

463
00:30:15.746 --> 00:30:18.681
<i>- Mr. Andre.
- Nicholas.</i>

464
00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:22.015
- Karl.
- Nick Nick Nick.

465
00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:23.679
Any word yet, sir?

466
00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.689
No, nothing yet,
Nicholas.

467
00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.693
I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

468
00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:31.786
Maybe we should cancel

469
00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:33.888
the preservation benefit
this weekend.

470
00:30:33.931 --> 00:30:35.796
It would be so easy
to reschedule it.

471
00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:38.267
No, I don't think we should do anything
out of the ordinary.

472
00:30:38.302 --> 00:30:41.328
Yeah, she's right. It's imperative that we
carry on as usual...

473
00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:43.067
- Okay.
...especially you, Mary.

474
00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:44.836
What am I
supposed to do,

475
00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:47.070
just go about my life
like everything is fine?

476
00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:48.942
That's exactly
what you should do.

477
00:30:48.979 --> 00:30:51.106
Yes, go skiing, go to parties,
act normally, you know.

478
00:30:51.148 --> 00:30:52.740
Yeah, don't you see,
honey?

479
00:30:52.783 --> 00:30:54.648
We can't let on
that anything's wrong.

480
00:30:54.685 --> 00:30:56.880
If the press or the authorities
get wind of this,

481
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.353
the kidnappers
may panic.

482
00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:00.914
Mm. I mean,
you never know

483
00:31:00.958 --> 00:31:02.926
what they might
do to him then.

484
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.015
So he says,
"Do you love me?"

485
00:32:02.052 --> 00:32:05.078
And she says, "No, but that's
a real nice ski mask."

486
00:32:12.229 --> 00:32:13.696
Hey, man,
what's that?

487
00:33:01.278 --> 00:33:03.246
Whoo!

488
00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.279
Ahh...

489
00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:20.290
eh?

490
00:34:21.558 --> 00:34:23.526
Aah!

491
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.221
Aah!

492
00:34:52.055 --> 00:34:54.353
Oh! Oh!

493
00:35:25.956 --> 00:35:28.390
Whoa!

494
00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:35.422
You want me
to drive?

495
00:35:35.465 --> 00:35:37.933
No, I'm cool.

496
00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:13.403
Yeah!

497
00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.928
Get her!

498
00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:22.008
Ohh.

499
00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:26.046
This is the life...

500
00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:28.950
cold beer, a hot tub
and paper-thin walls.

501
00:36:31.688 --> 00:36:34.657
There's only one thing that could make this
moment any better.

502
00:36:34.691 --> 00:36:36.352
What's that?

503
00:36:36.393 --> 00:36:38.293
If you had a nice set
of knockers.

504
00:36:38.328 --> 00:36:41.126
That's two things, Lloyd.

505
00:36:41.164 --> 00:36:44.099
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're not
stacked, Harry,

506
00:36:44.134 --> 00:36:45.601
or I'd be banging you
right now.

507
00:36:47.571 --> 00:36:49.664
I'd show you what
a real man can do.

508
00:36:49.706 --> 00:36:53.301
Split you like an
old piece of firewood.

509
00:36:56.446 --> 00:36:59.279
You'd probably like it too,
you big homo.

510
00:36:59.316 --> 00:37:01.011
Shut up.

511
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:04.248
<i>Don't tell me
to shut up, woman.</i>

512
00:37:13.597 --> 00:37:15.326
I don't know, Lloyd.
You know,

513
00:37:15.365 --> 00:37:17.196
this place doesn't
really do it for me.

514
00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:19.361
<i>It brings back
a lot of memories.</i>

515
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.133
<i>Pour quoi?</i>

516
00:37:22.172 --> 00:37:25.699
It was a few years ago.

517
00:37:25.742 --> 00:37:28.506
What happened, Harry?
Some little filly break your heart?

518
00:37:28.545 --> 00:37:30.137
No, it was a girl.

519
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.670
- Oh.
- Fraida Felcher.

520
00:37:31.715 --> 00:37:34.081
Yeah, we stayed in a place
just like this.

521
00:37:34.117 --> 00:37:36.517
Wasn't this classy,
but, you know, nice.

522
00:37:36.553 --> 00:37:39.454
Felcher?
From Cranston?

523
00:37:39.489 --> 00:37:40.786
Yeah.
You know her?

524
00:37:40.824 --> 00:37:42.621
Oh, yeah!

525
00:37:42.659 --> 00:37:45.184
I mean,
I remember you...

526
00:37:45.228 --> 00:37:47.594
talking about her.

527
00:37:47.631 --> 00:37:52.068
We had the most incredibly
romantic time.

528
00:37:52.102 --> 00:37:54.195
I thought we were gonna be
together forever,

529
00:37:54.237 --> 00:37:56.535
and then about a week later,
right out of the blue,

530
00:37:56.573 --> 00:37:58.234
she sends me
a John Deere letter.

531
00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:01.369
- She give you any reason?
- Yeah, I called her up.

532
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:03.106
She gave me
a bunch of crap

533
00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:05.478
about me not listening to her
enough or something.

534
00:38:05.515 --> 00:38:07.415
I don't know.
I wasn't really paying attention.

535
00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.385
But the thing
that hurt the most

536
00:38:09.419 --> 00:38:12.047
is I think she was
seeing another guy.

537
00:38:15.358 --> 00:38:18.657
Never did
find out who.

538
00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:44.247
<i>Mr. Andre, guess who
we just happened upon?</i>

539
00:38:44.287 --> 00:38:47.347
<i>- Yeah.
I had plans.</i>

540
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:49.255
<i>- Things I wanted to do.
- Yeah.</i>

541
00:38:49.292 --> 00:38:51.317
This is where it all ends...
at a phone booth.

542
00:38:51.361 --> 00:38:53.192
Yeah. The boys are holed up

543
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.095
in a little love-nest
for the night.

544
00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.828
I think they're
a little bit strange.

545
00:38:57.868 --> 00:39:00.462
What the hell are
these guys up to?

546
00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.734
I mean, is it possible
that they could be feds?

547
00:39:02.772 --> 00:39:05.400
Highly unlikely
from what I've seen.

548
00:39:05.442 --> 00:39:07.433
Sir, did you
ever hear

549
00:39:07.477 --> 00:39:10.412
of the concept
of other people?

550
00:39:10.447 --> 00:39:14.440
Um... me being that
for the phone,

551
00:39:14.484 --> 00:39:15.746
sir.

552
00:39:15.785 --> 00:39:18.481
Oh, you turned
your back on me.

553
00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.888
Ho ho ho!
He got me mad. I almost like it.

554
00:39:20.924 --> 00:39:23.119
You and Shay were
supposed to grab that bag

555
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.287
- so we could end this shit!
- Here's your drink, baby.

556
00:39:25.328 --> 00:39:28.764
Do you know the damage
I could do to you?

557
00:39:28.798 --> 00:39:32.393
Hold on a minute.

558
00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:34.528
Hmm.

559
00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:36.300
But that's not
your problem.

560
00:39:36.339 --> 00:39:38.273
You didn't know.

561
00:39:38.308 --> 00:39:41.004
Get off
the phone.

562
00:39:42.879 --> 00:39:46.508
Get off the pho...

563
00:39:49.486 --> 00:39:51.784
I'm sorry, Mr. Andre.
You were saying?

564
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:53.755
Look, Mental,

565
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.452
these jokers have got a lot of money
and it belongs to me!

566
00:39:56.493 --> 00:39:59.394
Now, I want to know who they are
and what they're doing with it!

567
00:39:59.429 --> 00:40:02.626
Hey hey hey, I told you already.
I'm on it.

568
00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:05.863
- All right?
- Good.

569
00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:10.155
According to the map,

570
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.904
According to the map,

571
00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:12.568
we've only gone
about four inches.

572
00:40:12.609 --> 00:40:14.304
You know,
I don't think

573
00:40:14.344 --> 00:40:15.777
we have enough
gas money.

574
00:40:15.812 --> 00:40:19.270
Relax. We have
more than enough.

575
00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:21.284
I think
you're wrong, Lloyd.

576
00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:22.615
How much
you wanna bet?

577
00:40:22.652 --> 00:40:24.313
I don't bet.

578
00:40:24.354 --> 00:40:25.787
What do you mean,
you don't bet?

579
00:40:25.822 --> 00:40:27.517
I mean I don't bet.
I don't gamble.

580
00:40:27.557 --> 00:40:29.582
Pussy pussy pussy!

581
00:40:29.626 --> 00:40:32.652
- I never have, and I never will.
- Yeah, right!

582
00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:35.426
I'll bet you 20 bucks
I can get you gambling

583
00:40:35.465 --> 00:40:37.558
- before the end of the day.
- No way.

584
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.262
- I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
- Nope.

585
00:40:39.302 --> 00:40:40.462
- 5-to-1?
- Nope.

586
00:40:40.503 --> 00:40:42.698
- 10-to-1?
- You're on.

587
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:47.742
I'm going
to get you.

588
00:40:47.777 --> 00:40:50.610
- Huh-uh.
- Oh, yeah.

589
00:40:50.647 --> 00:40:52.774
I don't know how,
but I'm going to get you.

590
00:40:52.816 --> 00:40:55.944
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Nuh-uh.

591
00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.749
Come on, Joe.
Let me do them.

592
00:40:57.787 --> 00:40:59.584
Let me do
both of them.

593
00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.181
You wouldn't even have
to worry about it.

594
00:41:01.224 --> 00:41:02.748
Just shut up!

595
00:41:02.792 --> 00:41:04.919
Now, we don't even know
who the hell they are.

596
00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:06.952
You don't kill people
you don't know.

597
00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:08.396
That's a rule.

598
00:41:08.431 --> 00:41:09.796
<i>Now, I want you
to get up here,</i>

599
00:41:09.833 --> 00:41:11.266
<i>lie down
on the front seat.</i>

600
00:41:11.301 --> 00:41:15.203
When they pick me up,
you follow us. You got that?

601
00:41:15.238 --> 00:41:17.570
Keep your shirt on.
I gotta squeeze a lemon.

602
00:41:24.547 --> 00:41:27.015
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Here they come.</i>

603
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.814
Stay down, stay down!

604
00:41:40.063 --> 00:41:43.294
Say, uh, are you guys
going to Davenport?

605
00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:46.666
My car died, and I'm late
for a luncheon.

606
00:41:47.804 --> 00:41:51.968
We usually don't
pick up hitchhikers,

607
00:41:52.008 --> 00:41:55.808
but I'm going to go with my instinct
on this one.

608
00:41:55.845 --> 00:41:58.313
Saddle up, partner.

609
00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.480
You're it.

610
00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:03.543
- You're it.
- You're it! Quitsies!

611
00:42:03.586 --> 00:42:05.645
Anti-quitsies.
You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies.

612
00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:06.986
- No startsies.
- You can't do that.

613
00:42:07.023 --> 00:42:08.991
- Can too.
- Cannot. Stamped it.

614
00:42:09.025 --> 00:42:10.549
Can too. Double-stamped it.
No erasies.

615
00:42:10.593 --> 00:42:12.891
Cannot. Triple-stamped it.
No erasies.

616
00:42:12.929 --> 00:42:15.523
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp!

617
00:42:15.565 --> 00:42:18.466
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp, Lloyd!

618
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:20.492
You can't triple-stamp a double-stamp.
Lloyd! Lloyd!

619
00:42:20.537 --> 00:42:22.232
Guys! Enough!

620
00:42:25.742 --> 00:42:30.076
Hey, you wanna hear the most annoying
sound in the world?

621
00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:36.609
Guys! Guys! Guys!

622
00:42:38.054 --> 00:42:42.081
Fellas,
you think we could

623
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.593
listen to the radio
or something?

624
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.797
Radio?

625
00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:50.823
Who needs a radio?
Ready, Harry?

626
00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.798
Hey, Lloyd, look! There's some people
who want a ride too.

627
00:43:22.832 --> 00:43:23.821
Pick 'em up!

628
00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:48.787
<i>You want an atomic
pepper, Mr. Mentaliano?</i>

629
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.427
Nah, you guys
go ahead.

630
00:43:53.463 --> 00:43:55.693
I'll do it
if you will, Lloyd.

631
00:43:55.732 --> 00:43:57.427
Okay.
You go first.

632
00:43:57.467 --> 00:43:59.059
No, huh-uh, no,
you go first.

633
00:43:59.102 --> 00:44:01.070
<i>- No, you go first.
- No, you go first.</i>

634
00:44:01.104 --> 00:44:04.096
- No, you go first.
- I always go first!

635
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.472
Why don't you guys
both stop acting

636
00:44:06.509 --> 00:44:08.136
like a couple
of pussies

637
00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:10.408
and go at
the same time, huh?

638
00:44:12.682 --> 00:44:15.412
- That sounds like a dare, Harry.
- It's a double-dare.

639
00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.044
Yeah, okay,
you're on.

640
00:44:18.054 --> 00:44:19.681
Mmm!

641
00:44:24.227 --> 00:44:28.186
- Huh. It's not so bad.
- Uh-huh.

642
00:44:28.231 --> 00:44:29.823
Yeah. It's more
tingly than hot.

643
00:44:29.866 --> 00:44:32.528
Yeah.

644
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:34.434
Agh!

645
00:44:42.979 --> 00:44:45.470
Uh, if you fellas
would excuse me,

646
00:44:45.515 --> 00:44:47.449
I've got to use
the phone.

647
00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:49.475
Enjoy your meal,
guys.

648
00:44:51.621 --> 00:44:53.589
Here, Lloyd,
this helps!

649
00:44:53.623 --> 00:44:55.614
Here here.

650
00:44:55.658 --> 00:44:57.182
It...
it works good.

651
00:44:57.227 --> 00:44:59.218
Ugh!

652
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:08.164
Yeah, it's Mental.
I'm just sitting down

653
00:45:08.204 --> 00:45:11.071
- to a nice meal with our boys.
- Well, how nice for you.

654
00:45:11.107 --> 00:45:13.598
Don't forget that your bread plate
is on the left!

655
00:45:13.643 --> 00:45:16.635
<i>Look, I can't have these guys
running around Aspen.</i>

656
00:45:16.679 --> 00:45:19.204
Don't worry. They ain't gonna be
runnin' around nowhere

657
00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:22.446
after I dump a little rat poison
in their Shirley Temple.

658
00:45:26.956 --> 00:45:30.619
- Good good.
- Okay, that's good.

659
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.128
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

660
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.620
Feeling better,
girls?

661
00:45:35.665 --> 00:45:38.065
Yes, much better.
Thank you for asking.

662
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:47.535
So why are you going
to Aspen? Vacation?

663
00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:51.107
Why don't you eat up
and we'll tell you?

664
00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.810
It just doesn't seem like
you packed much.

665
00:45:54.851 --> 00:45:57.911
All I saw was one bag
and that briefcase.

666
00:45:57.954 --> 00:46:00.252
Well, no no, the briefcase
isn't even ours.

667
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.087
Some lady left it
at the airport.

668
00:46:02.125 --> 00:46:03.820
We're just bringing
it back to her.

669
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.555
How's your burger?

670
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.595
You mean, you don't
even know her?

671
00:46:16.172 --> 00:46:18.663
I mean,

672
00:46:18.708 --> 00:46:23.008
talk about being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

673
00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:56.241
Are you okay, man?
It was just a goof.

674
00:46:56.279 --> 00:46:58.611
Oh, my ulcer!

675
00:46:58.648 --> 00:47:01.139
Quick!
My pills!

676
00:47:01.184 --> 00:47:03.652
Maybe somebody should
call an ambulance.

677
00:47:03.686 --> 00:47:04.983
Look, uh,
you get the pills.

678
00:47:05.021 --> 00:47:06.818
Don't worry.
I know CPR.

679
00:47:06.856 --> 00:47:08.016
I'll get
the pills.

680
00:47:08.057 --> 00:47:10.082
Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

681
00:47:10.126 --> 00:47:12.356
- Out with the bad air...
- Get off!

682
00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:17.928
Ugh!

683
00:47:20.269 --> 00:47:22.703
Agh, don't!
Don't don't!

684
00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.036
Back back!

685
00:47:24.073 --> 00:47:27.668
This is a lot easier
if you just lay back.

686
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.076
- Here.
- He's resisting me!

687
00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:33.344
Here.
Here we go, here we go.

688
00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:35.283
Pills!
- There you go! There you go.

689
00:47:35.318 --> 00:47:37.218
- Pills are good!
- Take 'em down.

690
00:47:37.253 --> 00:47:39.278
- Pills are good!
- Drink 'em down.

691
00:47:39.322 --> 00:47:41.051
There you go.

692
00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:42.955
<i>- There you go, big guy.
- That's better!</i>

693
00:47:42.992 --> 00:47:44.960
You want some ketchup
and mustard?

694
00:47:44.994 --> 00:47:48.054
That helped us.

695
00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:53.591
Son of a bitch!

696
00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:05.105
Check, please.

697
00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.743
I can't
believe it.

698
00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:12.084
Life's a fragile
thing, Harr.

699
00:48:12.121 --> 00:48:15.022
One minute you're
chewing on a burger,

700
00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.322
the next minute
you're dead meat.

701
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.794
But he blamed me.
You heard him.

702
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:21.694
Those were
his last words.

703
00:48:23.199 --> 00:48:25.360
Not if you count
the gurgling sound.

704
00:48:29.372 --> 00:48:32.239
- You mean he was poisoned?
- No doubt about it.

705
00:48:32.275 --> 00:48:35.403
We found these
next to the body.

706
00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:37.345
- Sir.
- Yeah?

707
00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.110
Waitress says he came in with
a couple of younger guys.

708
00:48:40.149 --> 00:48:43.448
Now they're the ones who called the
ambulance, and then they hit the road.

709
00:48:43.486 --> 00:48:46.216
- Get any idea where they were going?
- We just received a report

710
00:48:46.255 --> 00:48:49.247
that they were seen headed west on l-80
towards Colorado.

711
00:48:49.292 --> 00:48:51.385
Did you get a make
on the vehicle?

712
00:48:53.162 --> 00:48:54.823
Uh, yes, sir.

713
00:48:54.864 --> 00:48:59.301
They're driving
an '84... sheepdog.

714
00:49:56.926 --> 00:49:58.359
Skis, huh?

715
00:49:58.394 --> 00:49:59.884
That's right.

716
00:49:59.929 --> 00:50:01.897
Great.

717
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:04.161
They yours?

718
00:50:05.401 --> 00:50:07.130
Uh-huh.

719
00:50:09.872 --> 00:50:11.635
Both of 'em?

720
00:50:13.409 --> 00:50:15.274
Yeah.

721
00:50:15.311 --> 00:50:19.145
Cool.

722
00:50:21.417 --> 00:50:23.885
Um, excuse me,
but you're, uh...

723
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.218
you're spraying
everywhere.

724
00:50:27.256 --> 00:50:28.746
Oh!

725
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:22.008
Oh, man, you gotta be shitting me.

726
00:51:22.044 --> 00:51:24.808
If it ain't
my old friend!

727
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:29.785
And right on time.

728
00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:41.893
That's a lot of luggage
for a little vacation.

729
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:43.956
- I'm moving to Aspen.
- Oh.

730
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.026
I've got to get away from my boyfriend.
He's such a klutz.

731
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:49.867
Plus, my astrologer told me that
I really should stay away

732
00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:52.204
from accident-prone guys,
so, you know.

733
00:51:52.241 --> 00:51:53.868
Oh, well,
you know, I...

734
00:51:57.079 --> 00:52:00.310
Here. It's a little loose.
You might want to...

735
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:03.443
- Mm. Thank you.
- Oh, no. Hey, no, allow me.

736
00:52:03.486 --> 00:52:05.454
I've got
a thing of...

737
00:52:05.488 --> 00:52:07.922
here.
Got 'em right here. Right here.

738
00:52:13.462 --> 00:52:15.623
<i>Thank you.</i>

739
00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:18.634
Sure. You know, I'm heading up
to Aspen myself.

740
00:52:18.668 --> 00:52:20.363
Maybe we could,
you know, meet up,

741
00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.428
have some hot chocolate
or something.

742
00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:26.164
Sure, why not?
You seem harmless.

743
00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:27.573
I'm going to
give you my number.

744
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.441
- Let me find a pen though.
- Great!

745
00:52:29.478 --> 00:52:31.639
- Let's see.
- That's... ah!

746
00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.945
- I know I have one in here somewhere.
- Look, why don't you

747
00:52:33.983 --> 00:52:35.917
just tell it to me?
I got a really good memory.

748
00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:38.113
- Well, the number's 555...
- 555.

749
00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:41.146
905... wait a minute.
That's my old number.

750
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.420
That is so weird how
your mind just goes blank.

751
00:52:43.459 --> 00:52:46.292
For God's sakes, just
give me the damn number!

752
00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:49.924
Okay, look, uh, you gonna get pushy,
forget about it.

753
00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:58.600
Find a happy place.

754
00:52:58.641 --> 00:53:01.701
Find a happy place.
Find a happy place.

755
00:53:01.744 --> 00:53:04.304
I'll show you
a happy place.

756
00:53:05.314 --> 00:53:08.249
Here's your happy place.

757
00:53:43.652 --> 00:53:45.745
<i>Move those cars!
Move it! Move it!</i>

758
00:53:52.061 --> 00:53:53.995
<i>Go around, man.
Go around.</i>

759
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.726
<i>More flags over here!</i>

760
00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:58.700
All right,
any sign of them yet?

761
00:53:58.734 --> 00:54:00.725
No, sir, but we're
expecting them shortly.

762
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.898
A motorist saw a pooch about 30 miles
back headed this way.

763
00:54:08.444 --> 00:54:12.073
Look, I told you what happened, okay?
So just drop it.

764
00:54:12.114 --> 00:54:14.241
Yeah, okay. Sure thing, Lloyd.
Sure thing.

765
00:54:14.283 --> 00:54:16.751
I promise not
to mention another word

766
00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:19.254
about you being
in a bathroom

767
00:54:19.288 --> 00:54:21.256
with a 6'4" trucker
with his pants down.

768
00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:33.800
<i>Hey, look.
We're almost in Colorado.</i>

769
00:54:33.836 --> 00:54:36.066
What do you say
we change seats?

770
00:54:36.105 --> 00:54:38.335
I've been driving
for nine straight hours.

771
00:54:38.374 --> 00:54:41.343
I don't have the energy
to start a new state.

772
00:54:41.377 --> 00:54:43.277
Why should I do you
any favors?

773
00:54:43.312 --> 00:54:46.372
I'll let you kiss me.

774
00:54:46.415 --> 00:54:48.383
I swear...

775
00:54:48.417 --> 00:54:50.681
I'm gonna...
I will take your...

776
00:54:50.719 --> 00:54:53.279
I'm... I swear to God
I'm gonna take your...

777
00:54:53.322 --> 00:54:56.155
<i>- Aw, come on...
- Don't touch me.</i>

778
00:54:56.192 --> 00:54:58.422
Oh, okay.

779
00:55:02.131 --> 00:55:04.861
I'm done.
Okay, enough.

780
00:55:17.713 --> 00:55:20.341
Hey, guys.
Whoa, Big Gulps, huh?

781
00:55:20.382 --> 00:55:22.077
All right.

782
00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:24.746
Well, see you later.

783
00:55:26.689 --> 00:55:28.623
Hey, Harry,

784
00:55:28.657 --> 00:55:30.557
I got some beef jerk...

785
00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:38.794
Some people just weren't cut out
for life on the road.

786
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.234
Hey!

787
00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:16.864
I was wondering when
you were gonna get up.

788
00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:18.703
Ha!

789
00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:21.676
Well, how long
have I been out?

790
00:56:22.845 --> 00:56:25.973
I'd say
a good five hours.

791
00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:33.351
Huh! I expected
the Rocky Mountains

792
00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:36.517
to be a little
rockier than this.

793
00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:39.357
I was thinking
the same thing.

794
00:56:39.395 --> 00:56:42.887
That John Denver's
full of shit, man.

795
00:56:46.702 --> 00:56:48.932
I'm only human, Harry!

796
00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:52.407
<i>Anybody can
make a mistake.</i>

797
00:56:52.441 --> 00:56:55.808
Come on,
stop being a baby!

798
00:56:55.844 --> 00:56:58.369
So we backtracked
a tad!

799
00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:00.314
A tad?!

800
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:02.442
A tad, Lloyd?

801
00:57:02.484 --> 00:57:05.544
You drove almost
1/6 of the way

802
00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:08.921
across the country
in the wrong direction!

803
00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:13.218
Now we don't have enough money
to get to Aspen!

804
00:57:13.262 --> 00:57:14.923
We don't have enough
money to get home!

805
00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:17.455
We don't have enough
money to eat!

806
00:57:17.499 --> 00:57:20.127
We don't have enough
money to sleep!

807
00:57:21.403 --> 00:57:23.701
Well, it's not gonna
do us any good

808
00:57:23.739 --> 00:57:25.570
to sit here
whining about it.

809
00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.701
We're in a hole.

810
00:57:27.743 --> 00:57:30.211
We're just going to have to
dig ourselves out.

811
00:57:31.747 --> 00:57:33.442
Okay, all right.
You're right.

812
00:57:33.482 --> 00:57:35.382
You're absolutely
right, Lloyd.

813
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:45.984
Oh, well, pardon me,
Mr. Perfect!

814
00:57:46.028 --> 00:57:47.791
I guess I forgot

815
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.458
that you never,
ever make a mistake!

816
00:58:14.456 --> 00:58:16.947
<i>Harry!</i>

817
00:58:16.992 --> 00:58:18.687
Harry!

818
00:58:18.727 --> 00:58:21.423
Harry!

819
00:58:21.463 --> 00:58:23.727
<i>Harry!
Wait up!</i>

820
00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:41.283
Got room for one more
if you still want to go to Aspen.

821
00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:43.444
Where did you
find that?

822
00:58:43.485 --> 00:58:46.010
Some kid
back in town.

823
00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:48.751
Traded the van for it
straight up.

824
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:51.954
I can get 70 miles
to the gallon on this hog.

825
00:58:57.399 --> 00:58:59.833
You know, Lloyd,
just when I think

826
00:58:59.868 --> 00:59:03.395
you couldn't possibly
be any dumber,

827
00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:07.637
you go and do
something like this...

828
00:59:07.676 --> 00:59:11.510
and totally
redeem yourself!

829
00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:14.744
Ha ha!

830
00:59:14.783 --> 00:59:17.013
- Still wanna go to Aspen?
- Oh, yeah!

831
00:59:17.052 --> 00:59:20.715
- Okay, let's go, buddy!
- Super!

832
00:59:23.659 --> 00:59:27.595
- Lloyd, no! West! Go west, Lloyd!
- Oh! Oh, yeah.

833
01:00:12.741 --> 01:00:15.141
I've got to...
I've got to stop

834
01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:17.372
to go to
the bathroom.

835
01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:19.813
Just go, man.

836
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.947
Oh!

837
01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.017
That sure is warm.

838
01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.708
We're there.

839
01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:40.127
Got a little nippy

840
01:01:40.162 --> 01:01:43.131
going through
the pass back there.

841
01:01:45.567 --> 01:01:48.161
<i>Isn't this incredible?</i>

842
01:01:48.203 --> 01:01:51.172
- What more could two single guys want?
- How about some food?

843
01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:54.175
I swallowed a big June bug
when we were driving.

844
01:01:54.209 --> 01:01:55.699
I'm not
really hungry.

845
01:01:55.744 --> 01:01:57.678
Well, I'm starving.

846
01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:00.807
Ho... Jeez, look at
the butt on that.

847
01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:02.908
<i>Yeah.</i>

848
01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:05.784
He must work out.

849
01:02:05.821 --> 01:02:07.880
Hey! Why don't we get busy

850
01:02:07.923 --> 01:02:09.788
and deliver
the briefcase to Mary?

851
01:02:09.825 --> 01:02:11.554
If I know her as well
as I think I do

852
01:02:11.593 --> 01:02:13.788
she'll invite us right in
for tea and strumpets.

853
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:15.888
Good plan.
Where does she live?

854
01:02:15.931 --> 01:02:17.831
I don't know.

855
01:02:17.866 --> 01:02:20.528
What's her last name?
I'll look it up.

856
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:22.503
Uh...

857
01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:26.030
You know, I don't
really recall.

858
01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:27.905
Starts with an "S."

859
01:02:27.943 --> 01:02:32.141
S-swim, Swamie,
S-slippy, Slappy,

860
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.842
Slimin, Solmon,
Simin, Sal,

861
01:02:34.883 --> 01:02:36.043
Swenson, Swanson?

862
01:02:36.084 --> 01:02:37.881
Maybe it's on
the briefcase.

863
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.785
Oh, yeah!
It's right here.

864
01:02:39.821 --> 01:02:42.221
Samsonite!
I was way off.

865
01:02:42.257 --> 01:02:44.521
I knew it started
with an "S" though.

866
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:48.054
I'm not seeing
it here, Lloyd.

867
01:02:48.096 --> 01:02:50.360
She must be unlisted.

868
01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:55.003
Great.

869
01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:57.267
So what are we
supposed to do now?

870
01:03:00.842 --> 01:03:04.903
I can't feel my fi-fingers anymore.

871
01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:07.939
They're-they're-
they're numb.

872
01:03:09.651 --> 01:03:12.779
Ooh. Maybe you should
wear these extra gloves.

873
01:03:12.821 --> 01:03:15.756
My hands are starting
to get sweaty.

874
01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:18.988
Extra gloves?

875
01:03:19.027 --> 01:03:21.325
You've had this pair

876
01:03:21.363 --> 01:03:24.127
of extra gloves
this whole time?

877
01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:28.167
Yeah. We're in
the Rockies.

878
01:03:30.772 --> 01:03:32.535
I'm going to kill you.

879
01:03:33.742 --> 01:03:36.267
- What?
- I'm gonna kill you!

880
01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:39.610
- I'm gonna kill you, Lloyd!
- Calm down!

881
01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:41.172
Right now,
I'm gonna kill you!

882
01:03:41.216 --> 01:03:43.548
Harry, you got that crazy look
in your eye!

883
01:03:45.153 --> 01:03:49.112
I know what I'm going to do.

884
01:03:49.157 --> 01:03:51.284
<i>- What are you doing?
- I'm going to do something</i>

885
01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:53.851
I should have done
a long time ago.

886
01:03:54.863 --> 01:03:56.660
Don't do anything
foolish, Harry!

887
01:03:56.698 --> 01:03:59.030
What? Foolish?
This isn't foolish!

888
01:03:59.067 --> 01:04:01.365
I'm going to toss
this damn curse

889
01:04:01.403 --> 01:04:03.701
right into
that damn pond!

890
01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.468
<i>Aah!</i>

891
01:04:06.975 --> 01:04:10.172
- I'm going to do it!
- No, Harry!

892
01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:15.015
Harry!

893
01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.644
Your hands
are freezing!

894
01:04:17.686 --> 01:04:20.086
Aah! Ugh!

895
01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.386
Harry, look!

896
01:04:22.424 --> 01:04:25.120
Look! Look!

897
01:04:29.898 --> 01:04:32.196
Okay, here's the plan:

898
01:04:32.234 --> 01:04:35.101
We borrow a few bucks...
just a small loan from the briefcase

899
01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:38.163
- and we find some reasonable lodgings.
- Good plan.

900
01:04:38.206 --> 01:04:40.902
And we'll keep track of all the money
we spend with IOUs.

901
01:04:40.942 --> 01:04:43.172
We'll be meticulous,
right down to the last penny.

902
01:04:43.211 --> 01:04:45.645
- Whatever we borrow, we pay back.
- Absolutely.

903
01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.081
- We're good for it.
- Our word is our bond.

904
01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.776
This is
the Hotel Danbury

905
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.788
Presidential Suite,
gentlemen,

906
01:04:53.822 --> 01:04:55.813
<i>normally reserved
for royalty,</i>

907
01:04:55.857 --> 01:04:57.654

908
01:04:57.693 --> 01:05:00.093
<i>illustrious stars
of stage and screen.</i>

909
01:05:00.128 --> 01:05:03.655
<i>We have shortly coming the Emperor
and Empress of Japan,</i>

910
01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.668
<i>and of course, Princess Charles and Di

911
01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:08.693
<i>used to frequent
the hotel constantly.</i>

912
01:05:08.737 --> 01:05:10.227
We'll take it!

913
01:05:39.868 --> 01:05:41.597
There you go.

914
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:45.239
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

915
01:05:45.273 --> 01:05:47.207
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

916
01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:48.903
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

917
01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.344
There you go.

918
01:05:53.248 --> 01:05:55.113
Hi.

919
01:05:56.918 --> 01:05:59.352
<i>Rain brought them to him.</i>

920
01:05:59.387 --> 01:06:01.252
<i>My mother was Sarah Carver.</i>

921
01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:03.484
<i>Although at the time, he wasn't sure</i>

922
01:06:03.525 --> 01:06:05.789
<i>he wanted to accept the gift.</i>

923
01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:08.193
<i>Nick, do you think he'll let us stay?</i>

924
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:10.255
<i>No, this place is ugly, anyway.</i>

925
01:06:10.298 --> 01:06:13.392
<i>You and me,
we're a family.</i>

926
01:06:13.435 --> 01:06:15.960
<i>I promise never to give you away.</i>

927
01:06:16.004 --> 01:06:18.837
<i>And no one's
ever going to break us apart.</i>

928
01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:22.037
<i>At Pacific Bell, we believe
that's pretty special.</i>

929
01:06:22.077 --> 01:06:23.724
- Wow! Boy, this is livin', huh?
- Yeah.

930
01:06:23.759 --> 01:06:25.371
- Wow! Boy, this is livin', huh?
- Yeah.

931
01:06:25.413 --> 01:06:27.938
- What's on next?
- I don't know.

932
01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:30.213
Let me look it up.

933
01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:32.117
Ah!

934
01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.179
Lloyd, you okay?

935
01:06:34.222 --> 01:06:36.315
Harry, it's Mary!

936
01:06:36.358 --> 01:06:38.155
It's who?

937
01:06:38.193 --> 01:06:40.320
Mary with
the briefcase.

938
01:06:40.362 --> 01:06:43.525
<i>Mary Swanson.</i>

939
01:06:43.565 --> 01:06:45.965
Swanson!

940
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:49.198
- Wool hast anool...
- "Host annual."

941
01:06:49.237 --> 01:06:52.934
- Host anewl... annual...
- Annual.

942
01:06:52.974 --> 01:06:54.771
"Annual meeting of..."

943
01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.778

944
01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.336

945
01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.245
- The.
- Oh.

946
01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:03.342
- "The Inter..."
- Yeah. It's a big one.

947
01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:06.411
"International Preservation Society
tomorrow night."

948
01:07:09.357 --> 01:07:11.086
Well, come on,
Cinderella.

949
01:07:11.126 --> 01:07:13.993
We've got to get you
ready for the ball!

950
01:09:06.474 --> 01:09:08.465
Thanks, Barn.
There you go.

951
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:10.501
Thank you, sir.

952
01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.686
Okay okay okay.

953
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:30.254
- Ha!
- Cripes!

954
01:09:30.298 --> 01:09:32.493
Yes! Yes! Yes!

955
01:09:36.371 --> 01:09:37.838
Agh!

956
01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:41.971
- Time out!
- Okay.

957
01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:45.446
Excuse me. Gentlemen, this is
a $500-a-plate dinner.

958
01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.972
- Good night.
- Oh, 500... oh, okay. No problem.

959
01:09:49.017 --> 01:09:52.043
Here. Put us down for...
put us down for four.

960
01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:54.248
In case we
want seconds.

961
01:10:00.628 --> 01:10:03.153
Jesus Christ.
It's them.

962
01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:04.722
- Them who?
- Them,

963
01:10:04.766 --> 01:10:07.428
the guys who
whacked Mental.

964
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.062
Can't you just
feel it, Harry?

965
01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.732
This is our
big chance, man.

966
01:10:11.773 --> 01:10:13.536
All we gotta do

967
01:10:13.575 --> 01:10:16.043
is show a little class,
a little sophistication,

968
01:10:16.077 --> 01:10:18.102
and we're in like
a dirty shirt.

969
01:10:18.146 --> 01:10:20.580
That's no problem, Lloyd.
We can be classy and sophistic...

970
01:10:20.615 --> 01:10:22.583
oh, look at the funbags
on that hosehound.

971
01:10:22.617 --> 01:10:25.085
I'd like to eat her liver with
some fava beans

972
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.088
<i>and a nice
bottle of Chianti.</i>

973
01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:32.324
Come on, let's go get a couple bowls
of loudmouth soup.

974
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.089
Yeah.

975
01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:36.222
Hey, bartender,

976
01:10:36.264 --> 01:10:38.459
- two martinis, please.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

977
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.469
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?</i>

978
01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.596
The Aspen
Preservation Society

979
01:10:43.638 --> 01:10:45.663
is the world's
foremost defender

980
01:10:45.707 --> 01:10:48.699
of 23 endangered
species,

981
01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:51.234
and it is with
tremendous honor

982
01:10:51.279 --> 01:10:54.043
that we're able to bring
Mr. Swanson forward

983
01:10:54.082 --> 01:10:56.448
to introduce us
to the 24th. Everybody...

984
01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:58.418
Karl.

985
01:10:58.453 --> 01:11:00.614
Thank you, Nick.

986
01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:04.591
Thank you.

987
01:11:04.626 --> 01:11:06.423
Ladies and gentlemen,

988
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:09.453
I give you
the Icelandic snow owl.

989
01:11:17.138 --> 01:11:20.596
These magnificent specimens
constitute one seventh

990
01:11:20.642 --> 01:11:23.475
of the snow owl population
left on the planet.

991
01:11:23.511 --> 01:11:26.446
And God willing,
with your help

992
01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:28.540
and that of
the Society's,

993
01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:31.746
these wonderful creatures
will flourish once more.

994
01:11:31.786 --> 01:11:34.983
<i>Thank you again
and enjoy your evening.</i>

995
01:11:37.592 --> 01:11:39.822
Can I have
some pistachios, please?

996
01:11:41.763 --> 01:11:43.628
And another one
of those.

997
01:11:43.665 --> 01:11:46.065
Lloyd, what are you doing?
Would you calm down?

998
01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:48.569
I've never seen you
so nervous.

999
01:11:48.603 --> 01:11:52.334
Keep an eye on 'em, Shay.
Keep a close eye.

1000
01:11:52.373 --> 01:11:54.534
I'm ready for
a commitment, Harry.

1001
01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:57.409
The first time
I set eyes on Mary Swanson,

1002
01:11:57.445 --> 01:12:01.108
I just got that old-fashioned
romantic feeling

1003
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:03.413
where I'd do anything
to bone her.

1004
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:05.544
That's a special
feeling, Lloyd.

1005
01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:07.578
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1006
01:12:07.622 --> 01:12:10.682
<i>Oh my,
there she is.</i>

1007
01:12:10.725 --> 01:12:13.091
Wow! You weren't
kidding, Lloyd.

1008
01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:15.790
She's an angel!

1009
01:12:16.798 --> 01:12:18.561
Well, what are
you waiting for?

1010
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.433
Get over there
and talk to her.

1011
01:12:25.273 --> 01:12:27.605
She's just going to think
I'm some kind of a psycho

1012
01:12:27.642 --> 01:12:29.872
when she finds out
how far I came just to see her!

1013
01:12:29.911 --> 01:12:31.776
You know what you have?!
Her briefcase!

1014
01:12:31.813 --> 01:12:34.805
She's gonna be
thrilled to see you.

1015
01:12:34.849 --> 01:12:38.148
<i>Wait.
I have an idea.</i>

1016
01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.752
<i>Why don't you go over</i>

1017
01:12:41.789 --> 01:12:43.723
and introduce yourself?

1018
01:12:43.758 --> 01:12:45.726
And that way,
you can build me up

1019
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.728
so I won't have to
brag about myself later.

1020
01:12:47.762 --> 01:12:49.696
Tell her I'm rich

1021
01:12:49.731 --> 01:12:52.199
and, uh,
I'm good-looking

1022
01:12:52.233 --> 01:12:54.258
and, uh, I have
a rapist wit.

1023
01:12:54.302 --> 01:12:56.361
No, I don't know.
I don't think I could... no.

1024
01:12:56.404 --> 01:12:59.168
- Come on, please.
- No, I'm not...

1025
01:12:59.207 --> 01:13:02.301
- Please! Please!
- Okay okay okay. Stop.

1026
01:13:02.343 --> 01:13:04.243
What are you gonna do?

1027
01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:06.543
I'm going to
hang by the bar,

1028
01:13:06.581 --> 01:13:09.948
- put out the vibe.
- Okay.

1029
01:13:20.628 --> 01:13:23.028
Nice set of hooters
you got there.

1030
01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:28.598
- I beg your pardon?
- The owls, they're beautiful.

1031
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:32.303
Oh.

1032
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.308
Yeah.

1033
01:13:34.342 --> 01:13:36.276
Are you
a bird lover?

1034
01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.802
Me? Oh, no.
Well, I used to have a parakeet...

1035
01:13:38.846 --> 01:13:41.747
- Ah.
...but now my main area of expertise

1036
01:13:41.783 --> 01:13:44.274
is, uh, canines...

1037
01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.446
"dogs"
to the layperson.

1038
01:13:47.455 --> 01:13:49.650
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

1039
01:13:50.658 --> 01:13:53.627
- I love dogs too.
- Oh.

1040
01:13:53.661 --> 01:13:55.925
- So how are you involved with them?
- Oh, you know,

1041
01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:58.933
I've trained them, bathed them,
clipped them.

1042
01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.730
- I've even bred them.
- Oh, really?

1043
01:14:00.768 --> 01:14:02.736
- Any unusual breeding?
- No.

1044
01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.829
Mostly just doggy-style.

1045
01:14:04.872 --> 01:14:08.205
One time,
we successfully mated

1046
01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.609
a bulldog
with a shih-tzu.

1047
01:14:10.645 --> 01:14:13.546
Really?
That's weird.

1048
01:14:13.581 --> 01:14:16.209
Yeah. We...
we called it a bullshit.

1049
01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.660
Oh, I'm... anyway,
the real reason

1050
01:14:29.697 --> 01:14:31.858
<i>I came over here
was to...</i>

1051
01:14:31.899 --> 01:14:34.834
<i>I've got to introduce you
to a buddy of mine.</i>

1052
01:14:34.869 --> 01:14:38.327
- I don't believe I've met your friend.
- Oh.

1053
01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.864
Well, actually, we haven't been
properly introduced.

1054
01:14:40.908 --> 01:14:43.672
- My name is Mary Swanson.
- Hi, Harry Dunne.

1055
01:14:43.711 --> 01:14:46.441
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my stepmother Helen.

1056
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:48.745
Hi. Harry Dunne.
Pleasure to meet you both.

1057
01:14:48.783 --> 01:14:50.978
Mm-hmm. Well,
I saw you come in.

1058
01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:53.317
I was hoping I'd get
a chance to meet you.

1059
01:14:53.354 --> 01:14:57.552
- You were? Really?
- Yes! That tuxedo, it's fabulous!

1060
01:14:57.592 --> 01:15:00.390
Really. I love a man
with a sense of humor,

1061
01:15:00.428 --> 01:15:03.295
and so does Mary.
It's hysterical!

1062
01:15:03.331 --> 01:15:04.889
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

1063
01:15:04.932 --> 01:15:07.924
<i>Oh. Anyway, um,
about my friend...</i>

1064
01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:11.302
What are you doing tomorrow?
I believe that Mary

1065
01:15:11.339 --> 01:15:13.000
is looking for someone
to hit the slopes with.

1066
01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:14.770
She... what? Huh?

1067
01:15:14.809 --> 01:15:17.744
Helen, you're
embarrassing me.

1068
01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:19.747
Well, you are.
I mean, after all,

1069
01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.908
the snow's going to be gone
in a couple of weeks.

1070
01:15:21.949 --> 01:15:23.814
And, well, this may be
your last chance.

1071
01:15:23.851 --> 01:15:25.944
Poor thing, she never
gets a chance to get out.

1072
01:15:25.987 --> 01:15:28.649
Well, what do you say, Mr. Dunne?
Are you available?

1073
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.988
Well, I don't know.
See, my friend...

1074
01:15:31.025 --> 01:15:32.890
Oh, forget your friend
for one day.

1075
01:15:32.927 --> 01:15:36.021
I think you kids'll have
a wonderful time. What do you say?

1076
01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:38.294
Well, you know,
I don't know, you know.

1077
01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:40.767
You know, the thing...
part of... sure.

1078
01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:43.930
What time?
Ahem...

1079
01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:49.833
How come you didn't
bring her over?

1080
01:15:49.877 --> 01:15:51.845
Relax.
You're golden.

1081
01:15:51.879 --> 01:15:54.313
- I got you a date with her tomorrow.
- Oh.

1082
01:15:55.917 --> 01:15:58.351
- What... I... this...
- Yeah.

1083
01:15:58.386 --> 01:16:00.650
- I love you, man.
- Okay okay.

1084
01:16:00.688 --> 01:16:02.519
- You're kissing me.
- I love you.

1085
01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:05.025
- I love you!
- You're kissing me. Lloyd!

1086
01:16:07.428 --> 01:16:10.056
This calls for
a little of the bubbly!

1087
01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:12.328
- You're going to be my best man, Harr.
- Oh, good.

1088
01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.925
- I promise.
- Thank you.

1089
01:16:13.968 --> 01:16:15.936
You have just
earned yourself a seat

1090
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:19.929
at the head table, pal.
And we already got the tuxes.

1091
01:16:26.781 --> 01:16:29.113
<i>Gracious sakes!</i>

1092
01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:32.813
<i>Good grief!
- Boy, this party really died.</i>

1093
01:16:39.924 --> 01:16:42.415
Hey, maybe it was
a coincidence.

1094
01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:44.984
Hey, maybe it was a coincidence.

1095
01:16:45.029 --> 01:16:48.487
It was a message, Shay,
pure and simple.

1096
01:16:48.532 --> 01:16:50.727
I mean, we killed
their bird.

1097
01:16:50.768 --> 01:16:53.794
Now they killed
one of ours.

1098
01:16:55.739 --> 01:16:57.798
How could anybody
whack a bird with a cork?

1099
01:16:57.841 --> 01:17:00.139
These guys aren't
just anybody.

1100
01:17:00.177 --> 01:17:03.237
They're good.

1101
01:17:09.119 --> 01:17:11.451
Mary Christmas.

1102
01:17:11.488 --> 01:17:14.252
Mrs. Mary Christmas.

1103
01:17:15.826 --> 01:17:19.227
- Kinda catchy, huh, Harr?
- Yeah yeah, that sounds nice.

1104
01:17:19.263 --> 01:17:22.664
But, Lloyd, don't you think you might be
jumping the gun a little bit?

1105
01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.634
I mean, you know,
who knows?

1106
01:17:24.668 --> 01:17:26.533
You know, maybe,
once you get to know her

1107
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:28.902
you'll find out
that she's not your type.

1108
01:17:30.975 --> 01:17:32.738
Hey!

1109
01:17:32.776 --> 01:17:35.939
Don't you ever
say that again!

1110
01:17:37.014 --> 01:17:39.005
She is the love
of my life!

1111
01:17:39.049 --> 01:17:41.483
The blood in my veins!

1112
01:17:41.518 --> 01:17:43.213
<i>We belong together...</i>

1113
01:17:43.253 --> 01:17:45.551
till the mountains
fall into the sea,

1114
01:17:45.589 --> 01:17:47.489
till the heavens
collide!

1115
01:17:47.524 --> 01:17:50.118
Or until I get sick of her
and need to move on.

1116
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:53.596
- You hear me?!
- Okay okay okay okay. Just calm down.

1117
01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:55.496
Just calm down.

1118
01:17:55.532 --> 01:17:58.023
Okay.

1119
01:17:58.068 --> 01:18:01.128
Now...

1120
01:18:01.171 --> 01:18:03.639
let me
get this straight.

1121
01:18:03.674 --> 01:18:06.871
Lobby bar
in the lobby.

1122
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:08.673
Yeah, and that's
what she said.

1123
01:18:08.712 --> 01:18:10.942
She'll meet you there
at 10:00 sharp.

1124
01:18:12.016 --> 01:18:14.143
- Okay.
- Okay.

1125
01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.950
Where're you going
in that get-up?

1126
01:18:20.624 --> 01:18:22.615
Oh. I... you know, I just thought,
you know,

1127
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:24.753
when you'd be off making
your love connection

1128
01:18:24.795 --> 01:18:27.093
I'd be out trying my luck
on the slopes.

1129
01:18:27.131 --> 01:18:29.099
You mean you're gonna
go out in public

1130
01:18:29.133 --> 01:18:31.124
dressed in tights?

1131
01:18:31.168 --> 01:18:33.102
Oh no, these aren't
tights, Lloyd.

1132
01:18:33.137 --> 01:18:35.605
These are fashionable
Euro-trash ski trousers.

1133
01:18:35.639 --> 01:18:37.937
Pretty revealing.

1134
01:18:38.942 --> 01:18:40.239
Really?

1135
01:18:40.277 --> 01:18:42.302
Yeah, but it's
just a tiny lump.

1136
01:18:42.346 --> 01:18:44.746
No one'll notice.

1137
01:18:44.782 --> 01:18:47.342
You're right.
I can't go out dressed like this.

1138
01:19:03.634 --> 01:19:05.693
<i>Hey!</i>

1139
01:19:05.736 --> 01:19:07.260
<i>Coming!</i>

1140
01:19:09.339 --> 01:19:12.103
<i>Hey!</i>

1141
01:19:12.142 --> 01:19:14.906
Nice going, buddy!

1142
01:19:35.999 --> 01:19:37.967
Beautiful outfit,
sir.

1143
01:19:38.001 --> 01:19:40.060
There you go.

1144
01:19:50.814 --> 01:19:53.612
Hey.
How you doin'?

1145
01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:55.311
You're a little early.

1146
01:19:55.352 --> 01:19:58.321
We don't open
for about 45 minutes.

1147
01:19:58.355 --> 01:20:00.755
I'm meeting
someone here.

1148
01:20:00.791 --> 01:20:05.023
- Mind if I wait at the bar?
- No. Come on in.

1149
01:20:07.431 --> 01:20:10.059
It's a beautiful day,
huh, Harry?

1150
01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:13.900
Yes yes, I've had a wonderful time
so far. Thank you.

1151
01:20:13.937 --> 01:20:16.872
God, it feels
so good to get up here.

1152
01:20:16.907 --> 01:20:20.343
I haven't been outside that much
in the last couple weeks.

1153
01:20:20.377 --> 01:20:22.811
Oh, yeah?
Why not?

1154
01:20:22.846 --> 01:20:26.714
Um, there's been
some family problems,

1155
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:29.719
but I don't want
to bore you with those.

1156
01:20:29.753 --> 01:20:31.744
Thanks.

1157
01:20:31.789 --> 01:20:34.223
Oh, look. Frost.

1158
01:20:37.461 --> 01:20:41.090
Harry?

1159
01:20:43.133 --> 01:20:44.964
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah,

1160
01:20:45.002 --> 01:20:48.199
I do this all the time.

1161
01:20:51.775 --> 01:20:54.073
Let's go to the top
this time.

1162
01:21:01.018 --> 01:21:04.977
<i>- Hi, there.
- Ugh...</i>

1163
01:21:05.022 --> 01:21:06.751
Say, kids,

1164
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:08.690
you wouldn't
happen to have

1165
01:21:08.725 --> 01:21:10.818
a cup of warm water,
would you?

1166
01:21:10.861 --> 01:21:13.489
Yuck.

1167
01:21:17.234 --> 01:21:19.202
Excuse me.

1168
01:21:19.236 --> 01:21:21.431
Is it 10:00 A.M. Yet?

1169
01:21:22.439 --> 01:21:24.600
It's 1:00.

1170
01:21:27.277 --> 01:21:31.407
That's what I have too.
Thought maybe it was fast.

1171
01:21:34.418 --> 01:21:37.114
She's running late,
huh?

1172
01:21:37.154 --> 01:21:40.419
Just a couple hours.
You know girls.

1173
01:21:40.457 --> 01:21:43.153
When they're excited
about something,

1174
01:21:43.193 --> 01:21:45.525
everything has to
be perfect.

1175
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:55.129
This one's on me.

1176
01:21:57.274 --> 01:21:59.265
Yippee.

1177
01:21:59.309 --> 01:22:01.243
Chablis, please.

1178
01:22:02.246 --> 01:22:04.441
Hello.

1179
01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.513
Bad day, huh?

1180
01:22:13.523 --> 01:22:15.923
Me too.

1181
01:22:15.959 --> 01:22:17.824
'Course everything's
been bad

1182
01:22:17.861 --> 01:22:20.091
since I broke up
with my boyfriend.

1183
01:22:33.176 --> 01:22:35.610
Oh my God.

1184
01:22:38.849 --> 01:22:41.079
My God! You poor guy.
Does it hurt?

1185
01:22:41.118 --> 01:22:44.019
I'm fine. I saved
a seat for you.

1186
01:22:45.856 --> 01:22:47.551
Oh no, listen. This is silly.
Let me help you.

1187
01:22:47.591 --> 01:22:49.491
No no no no no.

1188
01:22:49.526 --> 01:22:51.858
Yes. It'll only hurt for a moment,
like a Band-Aid.

1189
01:22:51.895 --> 01:22:54.329
<i>- Come on, ready?
- No no no no. No.</i>

1190
01:22:54.364 --> 01:22:56.195
Come on. Go.

1191
01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:36.160
Come on, come on.

1192
01:24:38.468 --> 01:24:42.928
Pfft.

1193
01:24:42.973 --> 01:24:45.339
What am...

1194
01:24:48.712 --> 01:24:50.680
I said to myself,
"Run, Beth.

1195
01:24:50.714 --> 01:24:53.478
Run for your life before this man
kills you both."

1196
01:24:53.517 --> 01:24:56.179
Then do you know
what the klutz did?

1197
01:24:56.219 --> 01:24:59.017
<i>No, and I don't care!</i>

1198
01:24:59.056 --> 01:25:01.923
I'm going to tell you, He came home
one night dead drunk

1199
01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:04.017
and decided he wanted
to fix the sink.

1200
01:25:04.061 --> 01:25:05.551
Couldn't believe him.

1201
01:25:05.595 --> 01:25:08.029
Anyway, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

1202
01:25:08.065 --> 01:25:10.295
- How come you're here?
- Bartender!

1203
01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:12.528
Yeah?

1204
01:25:12.569 --> 01:25:16.437
You wouldn't happen to know
a Mary Swanson, would you?

1205
01:25:16.473 --> 01:25:19.306
Mary Swanson? Yeah.

1206
01:25:19.342 --> 01:25:22.106
She comes in here
all the time.

1207
01:25:22.145 --> 01:25:23.976
What's that
supposed to mean?

1208
01:25:24.014 --> 01:25:25.447
She has dinner.

1209
01:25:25.482 --> 01:25:29.578
Oh. I'm sorry.

1210
01:25:31.988 --> 01:25:33.478
Uh...

1211
01:25:33.523 --> 01:25:37.391
you know where
she lives?

1212
01:25:37.427 --> 01:25:41.454
Yeah, her family has the big place
up on Alpine Drive.

1213
01:25:41.498 --> 01:25:44.626
Alpine Drive?
Big place?

1214
01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:54.707
No way!

1215
01:25:56.313 --> 01:25:58.372
That's great!

1216
01:25:58.415 --> 01:26:00.781
We landed
on the moon!

1217
01:26:07.491 --> 01:26:09.482
I've gotta tell you,

1218
01:26:09.526 --> 01:26:12.154
today was just what I needed.
Thanks a lot, Harry.

1219
01:26:12.195 --> 01:26:14.993
Blell, blit blas...

1220
01:26:15.031 --> 01:26:17.522
it was my pleasure,
Mary.

1221
01:26:17.567 --> 01:26:20.502
So you'll pick me up
tonight at 7:45?

1222
01:26:20.537 --> 01:26:22.368
Well, no, I've got
a few things

1223
01:26:22.405 --> 01:26:24.032
to take care of first.

1224
01:26:24.074 --> 01:26:25.735
Why don't we make it
quarter to 8:00?

1225
01:26:25.775 --> 01:26:30.041
Stop it!

1226
01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.674
Okay 7:45.

1227
01:26:34.151 --> 01:26:36.984
Bye.

1228
01:27:21.364 --> 01:27:23.355
Doesn't make
any sense, Lloyd.

1229
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.163
She told me
10:00 sharp!

1230
01:27:25.202 --> 01:27:27.534
Are you sure you went
to the right bar?

1231
01:27:27.571 --> 01:27:31.439
Oh, yeah. Yep.
I'm pretty sure.

1232
01:27:31.474 --> 01:27:34.637
Lobby bar.
Right in the lobby.

1233
01:27:34.678 --> 01:27:37.806
Ahh... well...

1234
01:27:37.847 --> 01:27:40.645
maybe she just had
a change of heart.

1235
01:27:40.684 --> 01:27:44.120
Oh, that pisses me off!
That pisses me right off!

1236
01:27:44.154 --> 01:27:46.145
I hate when women
do that, you know?

1237
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:47.850
She wanted
to see you again!

1238
01:27:47.891 --> 01:27:49.756
She told me that!
And now no?

1239
01:27:49.793 --> 01:27:52.694
Now... wait a minute!
Wait!

1240
01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:55.664
She must have meant
10:00 at night.

1241
01:27:55.699 --> 01:27:58.224
Do you think?

1242
01:27:58.268 --> 01:28:02.261
Why would she have you meet her
at a bar at 10:00 in the morning?

1243
01:28:02.305 --> 01:28:04.466
I just figured she was
a raging alcoholic.

1244
01:28:10.213 --> 01:28:12.477
- Oh, that's th...
- And all this time,

1245
01:28:12.515 --> 01:28:16.417
I've been going through such pain
and personal anguish.

1246
01:28:16.453 --> 01:28:19.513
Such hell!
For nothing!

1247
01:28:19.556 --> 01:28:21.353
Oh, God.
That's funny.

1248
01:28:21.391 --> 01:28:23.723
Oh, that's good stuff.
Oh, boy.

1249
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.490
Well, listen, looks like
you got your night planned,

1250
01:28:26.529 --> 01:28:28.827
so I'm just going to head out
and catch a flick.

1251
01:28:28.865 --> 01:28:30.526
Okay.

1252
01:28:32.535 --> 01:28:34.901
10:00 in the morning.

1253
01:28:51.621 --> 01:28:54.249
Hey, Harry,
old buddy, old pal!

1254
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:55.918
<i>Yeah?</i>

1255
01:28:55.959 --> 01:28:59.417
Will you join me in a good-luck toast
before you head out?

1256
01:28:59.462 --> 01:29:02.863
Oh, sure thing. Whatever you think
will help your chances.

1257
01:29:02.899 --> 01:29:05.265
Yes, sirree.

1258
01:29:05.302 --> 01:29:07.566
You know why
I like you, Harry?

1259
01:29:07.604 --> 01:29:09.834
Because you're
a regular guy.

1260
01:29:11.274 --> 01:29:14.675
Yep, that's why I want you
to stay regular.

1261
01:29:15.812 --> 01:29:20.613
1/2 teaspoon for fast,
effective relief.

1262
01:29:35.965 --> 01:29:38.365
Mmm!

1263
01:29:41.304 --> 01:29:45.400
To my friend Harry...
the matchmaker.

1264
01:29:45.442 --> 01:29:48.900
Oh, get out of here.
I'm... I've...

1265
01:29:51.715 --> 01:29:53.649
Mmm.

1266
01:29:53.683 --> 01:29:56.516
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1267
01:29:56.553 --> 01:29:59.021
Mmm.

1268
01:30:15.305 --> 01:30:18.069
<i>Hi, the door's open.
Come on upstairs.</i>

1269
01:30:23.346 --> 01:30:24.779
- Hi.
- Hi.

1270
01:30:24.814 --> 01:30:26.441
Hi, make yourself
at home, okay?

1271
01:30:26.483 --> 01:30:27.950
I'm almost ready.
One minute?

1272
01:30:27.984 --> 01:30:30.509
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay.

1273
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:56.734
<i>Harry, are you
in there?</i>

1274
01:31:56.773 --> 01:31:58.764
Be right out!

1275
01:31:58.808 --> 01:32:02.574
I hope you're not using the toilet.
It's broken.

1276
01:32:05.715 --> 01:32:09.412
<i>- Huh?
- The toilet doesn't flush.</i>

1277
01:32:09.452 --> 01:32:11.647
No, I was
just shaving.

1278
01:32:11.688 --> 01:32:13.883
Shaving?

1279
01:32:13.923 --> 01:32:16.448
<i>Yeah, I was running
a little late.</i>

1280
01:32:16.493 --> 01:32:18.961
<i>I thought this
would save some time.</i>

1281
01:32:20.964 --> 01:32:25.196
Okay well, I'll be in the kitchen
whenever you're ready.

1282
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:30.432
Oh, Jeez!

1283
01:32:45.688 --> 01:32:47.519
Tomorrow on
"A Current Affair,"

1284
01:32:47.557 --> 01:32:50.117
inside the home of the Menendez
brothers' attorney.

1285
01:32:50.159 --> 01:32:52.389
And next, we'll be
back in a minute

1286
01:32:52.428 --> 01:32:56.831
with the heartbreaking story
of the blind Rhode Island boy

1287
01:32:56.866 --> 01:32:59.801
who was duped into
buying a dead parakeet.

1288
01:32:59.836 --> 01:33:02.999
I just thought
he was real quiet.

1289
01:33:07.744 --> 01:33:09.473
Who are these
sick people?

1290
01:33:14.584 --> 01:33:16.643
- Hi!
- Hi.

1291
01:33:16.686 --> 01:33:18.745
Yes?

1292
01:33:18.788 --> 01:33:20.483
Remember me?

1293
01:33:21.491 --> 01:33:24.722
Uh... not really.

1294
01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:28.720
Providen...
Providence.

1295
01:33:28.765 --> 01:33:30.790
I drove you
to the airport last week.

1296
01:33:30.833 --> 01:33:32.698
Oh my God!

1297
01:33:32.735 --> 01:33:35.465
Uh... Lloyd, right?

1298
01:33:35.505 --> 01:33:39.066
You remembered
my name.

1299
01:33:39.108 --> 01:33:41.508
What are you doing
in Aspen?

1300
01:33:41.544 --> 01:33:43.136
I brought you
your briefcase.

1301
01:33:43.179 --> 01:33:46.910
You left it at the airport,
you big goof!

1302
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:49.783
- You have my briefcase?
- Yeah.

1303
01:33:49.819 --> 01:33:51.946
Hey, I have it
at my hotel room.

1304
01:33:51.988 --> 01:33:54.650
You want to jump on the bike with me?
We can go get it

1305
01:33:54.691 --> 01:33:58.149
unless...
unless you're busy.

1306
01:33:58.194 --> 01:34:00.128
Oh, no no no!
No no!

1307
01:34:00.163 --> 01:34:02.028
- I don't wanna...
- You just wait right here.

1308
01:34:02.065 --> 01:34:03.760
- Okay.
- Okay?

1309
01:34:08.605 --> 01:34:11.096
Come on, flush,
you bastard!

1310
01:34:14.711 --> 01:34:17.043
<i>Harry, what are
you doing in there?</i>

1311
01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:22.450
<i>I'm just... I'm cleaning my teeth!</i>

1312
01:34:35.765 --> 01:34:37.426
<i>I'm cleaning my teeth.</i>

1313
01:34:38.901 --> 01:34:41.062
I'm gargling.

1314
01:34:41.104 --> 01:34:43.766
Just give me a minute, Mary.
I'll be right with you.

1315
01:34:43.806 --> 01:34:46.104
Harry, I'm sorry, but something
important's come up,

1316
01:34:46.142 --> 01:34:48.042
and I've got
to run out.

1317
01:34:48.077 --> 01:34:50.910
It's-it's sort of an emergency.
I'll explain later.

1318
01:34:50.947 --> 01:34:54.576
<i>- But, Mary...
- I'm sorry. I've really got to go.</i>

1319
01:34:54.617 --> 01:34:56.949
I promise we'll do this
again sometime.

1320
01:35:08.231 --> 01:35:10.563
Race you to the top.

1321
01:35:12.235 --> 01:35:15.227
- Come here.
- Agh!

1322
01:35:18.041 --> 01:35:21.568
Yeah! Ha ha!

1323
01:35:22.745 --> 01:35:24.269
I won!

1324
01:35:24.313 --> 01:35:27.077
Look familiar?

1325
01:35:27.116 --> 01:35:29.016
I don't believe it.
You really have it.

1326
01:35:29.052 --> 01:35:30.849
Of course, I have it.

1327
01:35:30.887 --> 01:35:33.151
When Lloyd Christmas
drives a woman to the airport,

1328
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:34.952
he makes sure she gets
all her luggage.

1329
01:35:34.991 --> 01:35:38.017
- That's my whole philosophy.
- This is incredible.

1330
01:35:38.061 --> 01:35:40.825
You mean to say
you drove 2,000 miles

1331
01:35:40.863 --> 01:35:43.297
just for me?

1332
01:35:43.332 --> 01:35:48.395
Uh... I didn't really
have a lot to do.

1333
01:35:49.806 --> 01:35:51.671
And I know how
frustrating it can be

1334
01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:53.801
to lose a bag.

1335
01:35:53.843 --> 01:35:57.006
That is so sweet, Lloyd.

1336
01:36:11.394 --> 01:36:14.693
Look, Mary, I know this may
seem a little sudden,

1337
01:36:14.731 --> 01:36:16.824
but I've given it
a lot of thought.

1338
01:36:16.866 --> 01:36:19.994
You're the woman I've been waiting
for my whole life,

1339
01:36:20.036 --> 01:36:21.799
and I'm not ashamed
to admit it.

1340
01:36:21.838 --> 01:36:25.968
Please...
Let me finish.

1341
01:36:26.008 --> 01:36:29.307
I'm crazy about you.

1342
01:36:29.345 --> 01:36:32.212
<i>I've never felt this way
about anybody.</i>

1343
01:36:32.248 --> 01:36:34.978
Listen to me.

1344
01:36:35.017 --> 01:36:38.009
I feel like
a schoolboy again,

1345
01:36:38.054 --> 01:36:40.818
a schoolboy
who desperately wants

1346
01:36:40.857 --> 01:36:43.587
to make sweet
sweet love to you.

1347
01:36:53.002 --> 01:36:56.631
Oh, I thought I heard
you talking to someone.

1348
01:36:58.841 --> 01:37:02.641
Mary, I- I...

1349
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:11.151
I desperately want to make love
to a schoolboy.

1350
01:37:12.388 --> 01:37:15.221
- Maybe I should be going.
- No no...

1351
01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.129
No, I... that's not
what I meant.

1352
01:37:23.132 --> 01:37:28.035
Um... what I
meant was, um...

1353
01:37:30.173 --> 01:37:32.073
God.

1354
01:37:32.108 --> 01:37:35.100
I-I like you, Mary.

1355
01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:41.109
I like you a lot.

1356
01:37:42.418 --> 01:37:47.048
I want to ask you a question
straight out, flat out,

1357
01:37:47.089 --> 01:37:49.421
and I want you to give me
an honest answer.

1358
01:37:49.458 --> 01:37:51.892
What do you think
the chances are

1359
01:37:51.928 --> 01:37:55.989
of a guy like you
and a girl like me...

1360
01:37:57.433 --> 01:37:59.731
ending up together?

1361
01:37:59.769 --> 01:38:02.101
Well, Lloyd,
that's difficult to say.

1362
01:38:02.138 --> 01:38:04.834
We really don't...

1363
01:38:04.907 --> 01:38:07.467
Hit me with it!
Just give it to me straight!

1364
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:09.740
I came a long way
just to see you, Mary.

1365
01:38:09.779 --> 01:38:12.304
Just... the least you can do
is level with me.

1366
01:38:12.348 --> 01:38:14.748
What are my chances?

1367
01:38:14.784 --> 01:38:17.309
Not good.

1368
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:25.784
You mean not good,
like one out of 100?

1369
01:38:25.828 --> 01:38:30.197
I'd say more like
one out of a million.

1370
01:38:35.504 --> 01:38:39.372
So you're telling me
there's a chance!

1371
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:43.603
Yeah!

1372
01:38:45.214 --> 01:38:47.182
I read you.

1373
01:38:54.223 --> 01:38:57.192
Hi. We have plenty
of towels. Thanks.

1374
01:38:57.226 --> 01:39:00.059
Nicholas!
What are you doing here?

1375
01:39:00.096 --> 01:39:01.791
I've been looking
for you, Mary.

1376
01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:03.822
I have some news
about your husband.

1377
01:39:05.067 --> 01:39:08.434
Husband?!
Wait a minute!

1378
01:39:10.039 --> 01:39:13.805
What was all that
one-in-a-million talk?

1379
01:39:13.843 --> 01:39:16.641
Aren't you going to
invite me in?

1380
01:39:21.617 --> 01:39:25.314
<i>Hey, Harry,
you never called!</i>

1381
01:39:25.354 --> 01:39:27.288
What are you doing here?

1382
01:39:31.294 --> 01:39:34.388
Excuse me, gunman,
who are you?

1383
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:36.455
Don't play dumb
with me, asshole!

1384
01:39:36.499 --> 01:39:39.366
I'm the rightful owner of that briefcase
you've been carrying around!

1385
01:39:39.402 --> 01:39:41.529
Oh. Well, then...

1386
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:45.597
Nicholas, my family
trusted you.

1387
01:39:45.641 --> 01:39:47.836
Shut up!

1388
01:39:47.877 --> 01:39:51.870
Listen, Mr. Samsonite,
about the briefcase...

1389
01:39:51.914 --> 01:39:53.939
my friend Harry and I
have every intention

1390
01:39:53.983 --> 01:39:56.543
- of fully reimbursing you.
- What?

1391
01:39:56.585 --> 01:40:00.112
You open it up.
Open it up!

1392
01:40:00.156 --> 01:40:02.989
Go ahead, open it up.
Do what he says.

1393
01:40:03.025 --> 01:40:04.788
Hurry.

1394
01:40:09.665 --> 01:40:12.156
What is this?
What is this?

1395
01:40:12.201 --> 01:40:13.896
Where's all the money?

1396
01:40:13.936 --> 01:40:16.871
That's as good
as money, sir.

1397
01:40:16.906 --> 01:40:19.397
Those are IOUs.
Go ahead and add it up.

1398
01:40:19.442 --> 01:40:21.376
Every cent's
accounted for.

1399
01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:24.345
Look. See this?

1400
01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.644
That's a car.
275 thou.

1401
01:40:26.682 --> 01:40:28.843
Might want to hang on
to that one.

1402
01:40:32.655 --> 01:40:35.681
You're a dead man.
You're a dead man!

1403
01:40:40.663 --> 01:40:43.598
Lloyd, I'm home!

1404
01:40:43.632 --> 01:40:46.931
Look, we've got to have
a serious talk.

1405
01:40:46.969 --> 01:40:48.493
<i>I got a confession
to make.</i>

1406
01:40:48.537 --> 01:40:50.368
Oh, good.
You found her.

1407
01:40:50.406 --> 01:40:51.964
I'll leave
you two alone.

1408
01:40:52.008 --> 01:40:54.203
No. Stay.

1409
01:40:55.211 --> 01:40:57.179
Ugh!

1410
01:41:00.649 --> 01:41:03.641
Yes, I'd like a one-way ticket
to Amsterdam

1411
01:41:03.686 --> 01:41:06.382
departing as soon
as possible, please.

1412
01:41:06.422 --> 01:41:09.016
How do you guys
know each other?

1413
01:41:09.058 --> 01:41:10.992
We used to be
best friends.

1414
01:41:11.027 --> 01:41:12.995
Yeah, until he turned
into a backstabber.

1415
01:41:13.029 --> 01:41:16.055
<i>Me a backstabber?
You got a lot of nerve.</i>

1416
01:41:16.098 --> 01:41:17.929
You knew I was
crazy about her!

1417
01:41:17.967 --> 01:41:20.265
And you knew I was crazy
about Fraida Felcher,

1418
01:41:20.302 --> 01:41:23.703
and that didn't stop you, did it?

1419
01:41:23.739 --> 01:41:26.037
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

1420
01:41:26.075 --> 01:41:27.975
Don't deny it, Lloyd.

1421
01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:31.275
Fraida told me the whole sleazy story,
Mr. French Tickler.

1422
01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:36.675
Okay, what time does it...
what time does that leave?

1423
01:41:36.719 --> 01:41:38.687
Thank you...
wait a second.

1424
01:41:38.721 --> 01:41:40.655
Can I have
a vegetarian meal?

1425
01:41:40.689 --> 01:41:43.089
I guess we both learned
a little something

1426
01:41:43.125 --> 01:41:45.593
- about each other today, didn't we?
- Yeah, you said it, pal.

1427
01:41:45.628 --> 01:41:47.289
Maybe we're not as good of
friends as we thought we were.

1428
01:41:47.329 --> 01:41:48.261
I guess not.

1429
01:41:48.297 --> 01:41:51.164
I mean, if one beautiful girl
can rip us apart like this,

1430
01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:53.191
then maybe our friendship
isn't worth a damn.

1431
01:41:53.235 --> 01:41:54.668
Maybe we should
call it quits right now.

1432
01:41:54.703 --> 01:41:56.671
You just tell me
where to sign, bud.

1433
01:41:56.705 --> 01:41:58.696
Right on my ass
after you kiss it!

1434
01:41:58.741 --> 01:42:00.333
Kiss it?!
You kiss mine!

1435
01:42:00.376 --> 01:42:02.537
Both cheeks, both lips,
right here!

1436
01:42:02.578 --> 01:42:06.537
- Put it right...
- Shut up!

1437
01:42:08.551 --> 01:42:11.281
Now, which one of you losers
wants to get it first?

1438
01:42:12.755 --> 01:42:15.315
Over here...

1439
01:42:15.357 --> 01:42:17.757
I was the one that got you into
this whole mess.

1440
01:42:17.793 --> 01:42:20.091
Come on
and shoot me.

1441
01:42:20.129 --> 01:42:23.155
No! Wait! Wait.
No no, do me first.

1442
01:42:23.199 --> 01:42:25.292
I stole your girl, Lloyd.
I deserve it.

1443
01:42:25.334 --> 01:42:26.767
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1444
01:42:26.802 --> 01:42:28.997
- No, you don't...
- Yes, I do!

1445
01:42:29.038 --> 01:42:31.404
Yesterday was one of the greatest
days of my life.

1446
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.570
Mary and I went skiing, we made
a snowman, she touched my leg.

1447
01:42:35.611 --> 01:42:37.977
Okay, kill him!

1448
01:42:44.453 --> 01:42:46.853
Oh! Oh, no!

1449
01:42:48.324 --> 01:42:51.589
You killed my best friend,
you bastard!

1450
01:42:51.627 --> 01:42:53.254
If it's any consolation,

1451
01:42:53.295 --> 01:42:55.456
you're about
to be reunited.

1452
01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:05.472
Harry!
You're alive!

1453
01:43:05.508 --> 01:43:08.204
And you're
a horrible shot.

1454
01:43:08.244 --> 01:43:10.303
Lucky me.

1455
01:43:10.346 --> 01:43:12.814
Police! Open up!
Nobody move!

1456
01:43:12.848 --> 01:43:16.215
Everybody freeze!
Get those hands up!

1457
01:43:16.252 --> 01:43:17.742
<i>Not you, dummy!</i>

1458
01:43:17.786 --> 01:43:19.344
<i>Get the gun.</i>

1459
01:43:19.388 --> 01:43:22.084
Special Officer
Beth Jordan, FBI.

1460
01:43:22.124 --> 01:43:23.682
Hey! Who?
But... huh?

1461
01:43:23.726 --> 01:43:25.660
Mr. Dunne,
thank you very much.

1462
01:43:25.694 --> 01:43:28.663
We couldn't have
done it without you.

1463
01:43:28.697 --> 01:43:30.221
We've been
following you guys

1464
01:43:30.266 --> 01:43:31.597
all the way
from Providence.

1465
01:43:31.634 --> 01:43:33.431
What's going on,
Harry?

1466
01:43:33.469 --> 01:43:36.768
Your name is Harry,
isn't it?

1467
01:43:36.805 --> 01:43:40.332
Yeah, she-she grabbed me down the lobby,
explained what was up.

1468
01:43:40.376 --> 01:43:42.469
Then they slapped
this bulletproof vest on me

1469
01:43:42.511 --> 01:43:44.638
and gave me a gun.

1470
01:43:46.415 --> 01:43:48.781
But what if he shot you
in the face?

1471
01:43:49.852 --> 01:43:52.252
What if he shot me
in the face?

1472
01:43:52.288 --> 01:43:54.586
That's a risk
we were willing to take.

1473
01:43:54.623 --> 01:43:56.488
How come I didn't
get a gun?

1474
01:43:56.525 --> 01:43:58.789
Did you
get a gun?

1475
01:44:26.789 --> 01:44:28.689
You were right,
Lloyd.

1476
01:44:28.724 --> 01:44:30.783
She was definitely
worth the trip.

1477
01:44:30.826 --> 01:44:35.354
Yeah. She's something,
ain't she, Harr?

1478
01:44:35.397 --> 01:44:37.262
I'm glad we were able
to help her out.

1479
01:44:47.176 --> 01:44:48.905
- Honey!
- Easy easy.

1480
01:44:48.944 --> 01:44:51.310
- You're okay.
- Okay, I'm just a little sore.

1481
01:44:51.347 --> 01:44:54.214
I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie.

1482
01:44:54.250 --> 01:44:56.514
<i>Oh, baby, I missed
your loving.</i>

1483
01:44:56.552 --> 01:44:58.816
Honey, there's someone
I want to introduce you to.

1484
01:44:58.854 --> 01:45:01.288
He's the kindest,
gentlest man I've ever met.

1485
01:45:01.323 --> 01:45:03.154
- Will you meet him?
- Sure.

1486
01:45:03.192 --> 01:45:05.558
He's got a gun!

1487
01:45:08.264 --> 01:45:11.165
<i>Lloyd? Lloyd!</i>

1488
01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.168
Huh?

1489
01:45:13.202 --> 01:45:16.296
I said this is
my husband Bobby.

1490
01:45:16.338 --> 01:45:19.330
- Oh. Hi, Bobby.
- Hi.

1491
01:45:19.375 --> 01:45:23.869
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

1492
01:45:23.912 --> 01:45:26.745
Thank you both
very much.

1493
01:45:26.782 --> 01:45:30.377
I owe you both
a debt of gratitude.

1494
01:45:30.419 --> 01:45:32.182
Thank you.

1495
01:45:51.273 --> 01:45:53.741
I can't believe
this, Lloyd.

1496
01:45:53.776 --> 01:45:55.676
First Mary dumps us,

1497
01:45:55.711 --> 01:45:57.645
then the cops take
our nest egg.

1498
01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:59.773
- Then our hog breaks down.
- Yeah!

1499
01:45:59.815 --> 01:46:02.943
When are we ever
gonna catch a break?

1500
01:46:16.498 --> 01:46:20.434
Hi, y'all.

1501
01:46:20.469 --> 01:46:22.630
Hi, guys! We're going
on a national bikini tour,

1502
01:46:22.671 --> 01:46:24.400
and we're looking for
two oil boys

1503
01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.806
who can grease us up
before each competition.

1504
01:46:31.013 --> 01:46:33.538
You are in luck!

1505
01:46:33.582 --> 01:46:36.847
There's a town about
three miles that way.

1506
01:46:36.885 --> 01:46:39.149
I'm sure you'll find
a couple guys there.

1507
01:46:41.890 --> 01:46:44.415
Okay. Thanks.

1508
01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.553
Bye!

1509
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:56.297
Do you realize
what you've done?

1510
01:46:56.338 --> 01:46:59.967
- Hey!
- Lloyd!

1511
01:47:00.008 --> 01:47:02.670
Lloyd!

1512
01:47:10.386 --> 01:47:12.684
You'll have to
excuse my friend.

1513
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:15.690
He's a little slow.

1514
01:47:15.724 --> 01:47:18.818
<i>The town is
back that way.</i>

1515
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:29.994
Wow.

1516
01:47:30.038 --> 01:47:31.938
Two lucky guys

1517
01:47:31.974 --> 01:47:34.067
are gonna be driving around
with those girls

1518
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:35.974
for the next
couple of months.

1519
01:47:36.011 --> 01:47:38.673
Yeah, don't worry.

1520
01:47:38.714 --> 01:47:40.545
We'll catch
our break too.

1521
01:47:40.582 --> 01:47:44.074
- Just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Yeah.

1522
01:47:47.022 --> 01:47:49.718
- You're it.
- You're it.

1523
01:47:49.758 --> 01:47:51.487
You're it.
Quitsies.

1524
01:47:51.527 --> 01:47:53.495
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
double-stamp.

1525
01:47:53.529 --> 01:47:56.054
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
triple-stamp.

1526
01:47:56.098 --> 01:47:58.089
- No erasies, none at all.
- You can't triple-stamp.

1527
01:47:58.133 --> 01:48:00.363
Yes, if you have a double-stamp,
of course you can.

1528
01:48:00.402 --> 01:48:01.960
You can't triple-stamp!

1529
01:48:02.004 --> 01:48:03.972
You can't if you
have a double-stamp!

1530
01:48:04.006 --> 01:48:05.769
You can't triple-stamp...
the rule!

1531
01:48:05.808 --> 01:48:09.767
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp, Lloyd!

1532
01:48:09.812 --> 01:48:12.645
Lloyd! Lloyd!
