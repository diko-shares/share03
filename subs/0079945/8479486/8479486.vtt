00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:41.948
Tactical.

Visual.

3
00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.499
Tactical, stand by on torpedoes-.

4
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:22.364
Ready...

5
00:05:25.986 --> 00:05:27.526
Fire!

6
00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:54.458
Evasive!

7
00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:06.736
<i>This is comm station Epsilon IX
calling USS Columbia.</i>

8
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.484
<i>Come in, Columbia. Respond, please.</i>

9
00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:10.691
This is Scout Columbia...

10
00:06:10.774 --> 00:06:15.728
<i>Epsilon IX,
this is dreadnought Entente NCC-2120.</i> ..

11
00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:20.432
<i>This is Epsilon IX, Columbia.
Am boosting output. How read you this?</i>

12
00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:24.136
<i>Fine, fine, Epsilon IX.
Proceed with your transmission.</i>

13
00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:27.716
Scout Columbia NCC-627,

14
00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:32.502
<i>to rendezvous with Scout</i> Revere <i>NCC-595</i>

15

16
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:38.788
<i>Further orders to be relayed at that time.</i>

17
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.535
<i>Signed, Commodore Probert, Starfleet.</i>

18
00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:43.033
<i>End of transmission.</i>

19
00:06:43.117 --> 00:06:45.823
<i>Received and understood, Epsilon IX.
Thank you.</i>

20
00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.695
<i>USS Columbia out.</i>

21
00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:50.110
<i>Intruder unidentified.</i>

22
00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:54.522
<i>Believe luminescent cloud
to be enormous power field</i>

23
00:06:54.605 --> 00:06:56.187
<i>surrounding alien vessel.</i>

24
00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.809
<i>Our sensor scans unable to penetrate.</i>

25
00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:04.179
<i>Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar
continuing to attack.</i>

26
00:07:05.594 --> 00:07:08.965
Our sensor drone is intercepting this
on Quad L-14.

27
00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:12.046
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?

28
00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:13.211
Unknown, sir.

29
00:07:15.085 --> 00:07:17.041
I have an exterior visual.

30
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.422
We've plotted a course on that cloud,
Commander.

31
00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:37.210
It will pass into Federation space
fairly close to us.

32
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.291
Heading?

33
00:08:40.082 --> 00:08:42.787
Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth.

34
00:09:37.815 --> 00:09:44.475
Our ancestors cast out their anlmal
passions here on these sands.

35
00:09:45.515 --> 00:09:52.092
Our race was saved by the attainment of Kolinahr.

36
00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:55.963
Kolinahr: through which all emotion
is finally shed.

37
00:09:56.047 --> 00:10:00.584
<i>You have labored long, Spock...</i>

38
00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:04.663
Now receive from us this symbol
of total logic.

39
00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:33.800
Your thoughts... give them to me.

40
00:10:39.086 --> 00:10:41.959
Our minds, Spock...

41
00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:45.663
...one and together.

42
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.522
This consciousness calling to you
from space...

43
00:11:01.605 --> 00:11:05.144
It touches your human blood, Spock.

44
00:11:13.593 --> 00:11:16.923
You have not achieved Kolinahr.

45
00:11:19.837 --> 00:11:22.210
His answer lies elsewhere.

46
00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:26.622
He will not achieve his goal with us.

47
00:11:28.662 --> 00:11:32.741
Live long ond prosper, Spock.

48
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.189
Commander Sonak.

49
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.727
You received your appointment
as Enterprise science officer?

50
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.808
Based, I am told,
on your recommendation, Admiral.

51
00:12:29.892 --> 00:12:31.349
-Thank you.
-Then why aren't you aboard?

52
00:12:31.432 --> 00:12:33.763
Captain Decker requested
I complete final science briefing here

53
00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:36.676
-before we leave on our mission.
-Here? At Starfleet?

54
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.881
The Enterprise is in final preparation
to leave dock.

55
00:12:40.963 --> 00:12:42.961
Which will require 20 more hours
at minimum, Admiral.

56
00:12:43.045 --> 00:12:44.044
Twelve.

57
00:12:44.835 --> 00:12:46.666
I'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura

58
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.955
which will not last
more than three minutes.

59
00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:51.120
Report to me on the Enterprise
in one hour.

60
00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:52.202
Report to you, sir?

61
00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:57.281
It is my intention to be on that ship
following that meeting.

62
00:12:57.363 --> 00:12:58.779
Report to me in one hour.

63
00:14:11.497 --> 00:14:12.705
-Admiral.
-Mr. Scott.

64
00:14:12.788 --> 00:14:16.076
Those departure orders. Twelve hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.

65
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.365
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters
operating, Mr. Scott?

66
00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:20.239
A wee problem, sir. Just temporary.

67
00:14:20.322 --> 00:14:24.734
Admiral, we have just finished 18 months
redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.

68
00:14:24.817 --> 00:14:27.523
How in the name of hell do they expect me
to have her ready in 12 hours?

69
00:14:27.606 --> 00:14:28.731
Take me over, please.

70
00:14:33.017 --> 00:14:35.390
She needs more work, sir. A shakedown.

71
00:14:35.473 --> 00:14:36.472
Mr. Scott.

72
00:14:37.804 --> 00:14:40.219
An alien object
of unbelievable destructive power

73
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:42.299
is less than three days away
from this planet.

74
00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:47.003
The only starship in interception range
is the Enterprise.

75
00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:49.418
Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours.

76
00:15:11.312 --> 00:15:13.851
The crew haven't had
near enough transition time

77
00:15:13.935 --> 00:15:15.475
with all the new equipment.

78
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.887
And the engines,
they're not even tested at warp power.

79
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.217
And an untried captain.

80
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.589
Two and a half years
as chief of Starfleet operations

81
00:15:25.672 --> 00:15:27.004
may have made me a little stale,

82
00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:30.501
but I wouldn't exactly
consider myself untried.

83
00:15:34.914 --> 00:15:36.578
They gave her back to me, Scotty.

84
00:15:36.662 --> 00:15:38.369
Gave her back, sir?

85
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:40.907
Well, I doubt
it was that easy with Nogura.

86
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.781
You're right.

87
00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:49.815
Well, any man
who could manage such a feat,

88
00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:51.896
I would not dare to disappoint.

89
00:15:53.062 --> 00:15:54.685
She'll launch on time, sir.

90
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.725
And she'll be ready.

91
00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:47.557
<i>-Pod secured.
-Thank you, Mr. Scott.</i>

92
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.555
<i>-Aye, sir.
-Pressure equalized.</i>

93
00:20:51.261 --> 00:20:56.713
<i>Attention, launch crew. A travel pod
is now available at cargo six.</i>

94
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.168
-Permission to come aboard, sir.
-Granted, sir.

95
00:21:00.252 --> 00:21:01.959
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

96
00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:04.206
Commander Scott,
you're needed in Engineering immediately.

97
00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:05.830
Sir, you'll excuse me?

98
00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:07.744
<i>Attention, launch crew.</i>

99
00:21:07.828 --> 00:21:11.698
<i>A travel pod is now
available at cargo six.</i>

100
00:21:11.782 --> 00:21:14.404
<i>Travel pod available. Cargo six.</i>

101
00:21:14.488 --> 00:21:18.108
-Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll show you--
-I think I can find my way, Ensign.

102
00:21:18.691 --> 00:21:19.774
Aye, sir.

103
00:21:24.478 --> 00:21:25.643
Bridge.

104
00:21:31.137 --> 00:21:32.136
What's the problem?

105
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.592
I thought you people had
that circuit patched in an hour ago!

106
00:21:34.675 --> 00:21:37.340
We did. We had to disconnect it again
so we could tie in radio messaging.

107
00:21:37.423 --> 00:21:38.546
All right. Take out...

108
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.663
All right,
as soon as somebody can get to it.

109
00:21:48.536 --> 00:21:50.493
What's the next program?

110
00:21:50.576 --> 00:21:52.491
I'll get somebody down there
as soon as I can.

111
00:21:52.574 --> 00:21:54.655
Cleary, my people are all tied up now.

112
00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:02.522
Captain, Starfleet just signaled
your transfer-of-command order, sir.

113
00:22:04.853 --> 00:22:06.602
-Captain.
-I appreciate the welcome.

114
00:22:07.975 --> 00:22:10.098
I wish the circumstances
were less critical.

115
00:22:10.182 --> 00:22:13.095
Epsilon IX is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

116
00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:14.219
Aye, sir.

117
00:22:15.676 --> 00:22:16.717
Where's Captain Decker?

118
00:22:17.424 --> 00:22:19.422
He's in Engineering, sir.

119
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:21.171
He...

120
00:22:21.253 --> 00:22:22.294
He doesn't know.

121
00:22:24.708 --> 00:22:25.707
Mr. Chekov.

122
00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:26.980
Aye, sir.

123
00:22:27.064 --> 00:22:29.769
Assemble the crew on the recreation deck
at 0400 hours.

124
00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.682
I want to show them what we're facing.

125
00:22:36.762 --> 00:22:39.384
He wanted her back. He got her.

126
00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:41.466
And Captain Decker?

127
00:22:42.298 --> 00:22:44.463
He's been with this ship
every minute of her refitting.

128
00:22:44.546 --> 00:22:49.082
Ensign, the possibilities of our returning
from this mission in one piece

129
00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:50.206
may have just doubled.

130
00:22:51.705 --> 00:22:54.328
<i>Engineering to all decks.</i>

131
00:22:54.411 --> 00:22:57.741
<i>Auxiliary power test in three minutes.</i>

132
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.818
Check Cleary at number six.

133
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:06.523
<i>Engineering to all decks.</i>

134
00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:09.812
<i>Auxiliary power test in three minutes.</i>

135
00:23:09.895 --> 00:23:11.102
<i>Mark.</i>

136
00:23:12.143 --> 00:23:15.390
Main stage flux chillers
port and starboard.

137
00:23:15.472 --> 00:23:18.012
Main stage flux chillers
port and starboard.

138
00:23:18.095 --> 00:23:20.467
-Enabled.
-Inter-cooler status.

139
00:23:20.551 --> 00:23:23.756
-Standby.
-Space matrix restoration coils.

140
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.254
<i>-Enabled.
-Dilithium crystals.</i>

141
00:23:26.337 --> 00:23:29.709
I knew it.
The transporter sensor was not activated.

142
00:23:29.792 --> 00:23:31.498
Air equalization automatic off.

143
00:23:31.581 --> 00:23:32.789
Faulty modules.

144
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:35.619
Cleary!
Put a new backup sensor into the unit.

145
00:23:35.703 --> 00:23:36.909
Aye, sir.

146
00:23:36.993 --> 00:23:39.740
-Ready.
-Emergency shutdown trips.

147
00:23:39.823 --> 00:23:40.863
Admiral Kirk!

148
00:23:40.947 --> 00:23:43.237
Well, we're getting a top-brass send-off.
Don't worry.

149
00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:46.441
She'll launch on schedule, if we have to
tow her out with our bare hands.

150
00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:47.524
Right, Scotty?

151
00:23:47.607 --> 00:23:50.562
Aye. That we will, sir.

152
00:23:51.727 --> 00:23:53.809
-Let's talk.
-Sure.

153
00:23:53.892 --> 00:23:56.306
-Let me know when that backup's ready.
-Aye, sir.

154
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.678
All due respect, sir, I hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

155
00:23:59.761 --> 00:24:02.634
-I'm really too busy.
-I'm taking over the center seat, Will.

156
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:04.632
You're what?

157
00:24:04.714 --> 00:24:07.337
I'm replacing you
as captain of the Enterprise.

158
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.290
You'll stay on as executive officer,
temporary grade reduction to commander.

159
00:24:15.703 --> 00:24:17.868
You, personally, are assuming command?

160
00:24:17.952 --> 00:24:18.951
Yeah.

161
00:24:19.492 --> 00:24:21.198
May I ask why?

162
00:24:21.281 --> 00:24:22.696
My experience.

163
00:24:23.987 --> 00:24:26.609
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

164
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:30.272
My familiarity with the Enterprise,
its crew.

165
00:24:30.356 --> 00:24:33.644
Admiral, this is an almost
totally new Enterprise.

166
00:24:33.727 --> 00:24:35.642
You don't know her
a tenth as well as I do.

167
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.015
That's why you're staying aboard.

168
00:24:43.759 --> 00:24:44.883
I'm sorry, Will.

169
00:24:45.673 --> 00:24:48.420
No, Admiral. I don't think you're sorry.

170
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.543
Not one damn bit.

171
00:24:52.375 --> 00:24:55.039
I remember when you recommended me
for this command.

172
00:24:55.122 --> 00:24:57.453
You told me how envious you were
and how much you hoped

173
00:24:57.536 --> 00:24:59.534
you'd find a way
to get a starship command again.

174
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.239
Well, sir,

175
00:25:04.862 --> 00:25:06.652
it looks like you found a way.

176
00:25:10.232 --> 00:25:13.604
Report to the bridge, Commander,
immediately.

177
00:25:16.434 --> 00:25:17.433
Aye, sir.

178
00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:32.502
Transporter room, come in! Urgent!

179
00:25:32.585 --> 00:25:34.416
Red line on the transporter, Mr. Scott.

180
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.705
Transporter, do not engage.

181
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:38.870
-It's too late. They're beaming now.
-Do not...

182
00:25:40.202 --> 00:25:44.739
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override us. Pull them back.

183
00:25:44.822 --> 00:25:47.029
<i>Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.</i>

184
00:25:49.027 --> 00:25:52.024
<i>Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction.</i>

185
00:25:53.064 --> 00:25:55.603
<i>Malfunction. Malfunction.</i>

186
00:25:55.686 --> 00:25:58.018
-Give it to me.
<i>- Malfunction- Malfunction.</i>

187
00:26:00.848 --> 00:26:04.053
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

188
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.086
-More signal!
-We're losing their pattern.

189
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.293
Oh, no. They're forming.

190
00:26:31.734 --> 00:26:33.024
Oh, my God.

191
00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:42.223
Starfleet, do you have them?

192
00:26:43.638 --> 00:26:47.842
<i>Enterprise,
what we got back didn't live long.</i>

193
00:26:47.925 --> 00:26:48.966
<i>Fortunately.</i>

194
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:55.376
Starfleet, Kirk.

195
00:26:58.248 --> 00:27:00.621
Please express my condolences
to their families.

196
00:27:02.785 --> 00:27:05.740
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan Embassy.

197
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.108
There was nothing
you could have done, Rand.

198
00:27:15.023 --> 00:27:16.313
It wasn't your fault.

199
00:27:41.288 --> 00:27:43.078
Yeoman. Turboshaft 8?

200
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.410
Back that way, sir.

201
00:27:51.985 --> 00:27:54.108
We have to replace Commander Sonak.

202
00:27:56.439 --> 00:27:58.937
I'd still like a Vulcan there,
if possible.

203
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.477
None available, Captain.

204
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.015
In fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

205
00:28:04.098 --> 00:28:05.722
You are, Mr. Decker.

206
00:28:06.471 --> 00:28:08.761
I'm afraid you're gonna have to double
as science officer.

207
00:28:41.625 --> 00:28:43.623
That's all we know about it.

208
00:28:45.412 --> 00:28:49.242
Except that it is now 53.4 hours
away from Earth.

209
00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:56.527
Enterprise is the only Federation starship
that stands in its way.

210
00:28:56.609 --> 00:29:01.646
We assume that there is a vessel of
some type at the heart of the cloud.

211
00:29:02.229 --> 00:29:05.309
Our orders are to intercept,

212
00:29:05.392 --> 00:29:06.641
investigate

213
00:29:06.724 --> 00:29:10.929
and take whatever action
is necessary... and possible.

214
00:29:15.673 --> 00:29:19.503
We can only hope that there is
a life-form aboard that vessel

215
00:29:19.586 --> 00:29:22.250
that reasons the way we do.

216
00:29:26.871 --> 00:29:30.450
<i>Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon IX.</i>

217
00:29:30.533 --> 00:29:32.406
-Put it on viewer.
-On viewer, sir.

218
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.443
<i>Enterprise. The cloud is definitely
a power field of some kind.</i>

219
00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:38.567
<i>Measures...</i>

220
00:29:39.899 --> 00:29:44.061
<i>My God. Over 82 AUs in diameter:</i>

221
00:29:44.145 --> 00:29:47.308
<i>Must be something incredible
inside there generating it.</i>

222
00:29:48.432 --> 00:29:52.261
<i>We're transmitting linguacode
friendship messages on all frequencies.</i>

223
00:29:52.844 --> 00:29:53.843
<i>No response.</i>

224
00:29:53.927 --> 00:29:56.008
<i>I have a null reading
at the center of the cloud.</i>

225
00:29:56.092 --> 00:29:59.463
<i>Definitely something inside there,
but all scans are being reflected back.</i>

226
00:29:59.546 --> 00:30:03.168
<i>-Some kind of power surge.
-Receiving an odd pattern now.</i>

227
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:06.456
<i>Enterprise, they could be
mistaking our scans as a hostile act.</i>

228
00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:08.454
<i>They seem to be reacting
to our scans, sir.</i>

229
00:30:08.537 --> 00:30:10.327
<i>Deflectors, emergency full!</i>

230
00:30:12.658 --> 00:30:14.281
<i>We are under attack.</i>

231
00:30:14.365 --> 00:30:15.614
External view.

232
00:31:14.596 --> 00:31:15.637
Viewer off.

233
00:31:18.634 --> 00:31:20.049
Viewer off!

234
00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:34.368
Prelaunch countdown will commence
in 40 minutes.

235
00:31:51.683 --> 00:31:53.140
<i>Photon torpedo load status.</i>

236
00:31:54.473 --> 00:31:58.218
Transporter system fully repaired
and functioning normally, sir.

237
00:31:58.302 --> 00:31:59.759
Dock signals clear, Captain.

238
00:31:59.842 --> 00:32:02.797
Reply we are holding position,
awaiting final crew replacements.

239
00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:03.880
Aye, sir.

240
00:32:04.795 --> 00:32:09.458
Transporter personnel reports
the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia,

241
00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.704
she's already aboard
and en route to the bridge, sir.

242
00:32:15.285 --> 00:32:17.366
She's Deltan, Captain.

243
00:32:22.485 --> 00:32:24.483
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.

244
00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:25.940
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

245
00:32:28.105 --> 00:32:29.104
Hello, Ilia.

246
00:32:29.187 --> 00:32:30.519
Decker.

247
00:32:30.602 --> 00:32:34.016
I was stationed on the lieutenant's
home planet some years ago.

248
00:32:34.099 --> 00:32:35.806
Commander Decker?

249
00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:39.094
Yes, our exec and science officer.

250
00:32:39.177 --> 00:32:41.841
Captain Kirk
has the utmost confidence in me.

251
00:32:43.756 --> 00:32:45.046
And in you too, Lieutenant.

252
00:32:45.866 --> 00:32:48.697
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.

253
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.819
-May I assume my duties?
-By all means.

254
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.274
Captain?

255
00:32:54.357 --> 00:32:57.063
Starfleet reports our last six
crew members are ready to beam up,

256
00:32:57.147 --> 00:33:00.851
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

257
00:33:02.308 --> 00:33:04.140
I'll see to it that he beams up.

258
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.929
Transporter room.

259
00:33:09.551 --> 00:33:10.757
Mr. Sulu.

260
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.212
Mr. Sulu?

261
00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:16.128
Take Lieutenant Ilia in hand.

262
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.209
Sir?

263
00:33:17.875 --> 00:33:19.707
Yes, of course.

264
00:33:22.829 --> 00:33:26.658
Your preprogramming is already set in.

265
00:33:26.741 --> 00:33:28.573
It's all on the computer.

266
00:33:29.364 --> 00:33:31.070
You'll have no problem.

267
00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:33.818
Sorry.

268
00:33:33.901 --> 00:33:36.648
I'm sworn to celibacy, Mr. Sulu.

269
00:33:36.731 --> 00:33:40.019
That makes me as safe as any human female.

270
00:33:45.847 --> 00:33:48.345
I don't think the captain
meant anything personal.

271
00:33:48.428 --> 00:33:52.007
I would never take advantage
of a sexually immature species.

272
00:33:53.714 --> 00:33:56.503
You can assure him that's true, can't you?

273
00:34:03.995 --> 00:34:05.452
-Yeoman.
-Yes, sir?

274
00:34:05.535 --> 00:34:06.909
What was the problem down there?

275
00:34:06.992 --> 00:34:08.616
He insisted we go first, sir.

276
00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:12.279
Said something about first seeing
how it scrambled our molecules.

277
00:34:15.235 --> 00:34:16.857
That has a familiar ring, doesn't it?

278
00:34:17.607 --> 00:34:20.104
Starfleet, this is Captain Kirk.

279
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:22.602
Beam that officer up now.

280
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.911
Well, for a man who swore
he'd never return to Starfleet...

281
00:34:46.994 --> 00:34:49.657
Just a moment, Captain, sir.

282
00:34:49.741 --> 00:34:51.780
I'll explain what happened.

283
00:34:51.864 --> 00:34:55.277
Your revered Admiral Nogura
invoked a little-known,

284
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.982
seldom-used reserve activation clause.

285
00:34:59.065 --> 00:35:02.021
In simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me.

286
00:35:02.103 --> 00:35:03.436
They didn't.

287
00:35:05.225 --> 00:35:06.308
This was your idea.

288
00:35:07.182 --> 00:35:08.763
This was your idea, wasn't it?

289
00:35:08.847 --> 00:35:10.304
Bones, there's a thing out there.

290
00:35:10.387 --> 00:35:13.426
Why is any object we don't understand
always called a "thing"?

291
00:35:13.508 --> 00:35:14.716
Headed this way.

292
00:35:15.756 --> 00:35:16.755
I need you.

293
00:35:19.644 --> 00:35:22.142
Damn it, Bones. I need you.

294
00:35:23.682 --> 00:35:24.681
Badly.

295
00:35:37.169 --> 00:35:39.042
Permission to come aboard?

296
00:35:39.999 --> 00:35:41.955
<i>Permission granted, sir.</i>

297
00:35:46.534 --> 00:35:47.658
Well, Jim.

298
00:35:48.657 --> 00:35:50.904
I hear Chapel's an MD now.

299
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.818
Well, I'm going to need a top nurse,

300
00:35:53.901 --> 00:35:57.024
not a doctor who'll argue
every little diagnosis with me.

301
00:35:58.231 --> 00:36:01.519
And they probably redesigned
the whole sickbay too.

302
00:36:01.602 --> 00:36:04.183
I know engineers.
They love to change things.

303
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.368
Dock control reports ready, sir.

304
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:29.782
Helm ready, sir.

305
00:36:29.865 --> 00:36:31.613
Orbital departure on plot, sir.

306
00:36:32.238 --> 00:36:34.568
Yard command signaling clear, sir.

307
00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:36.692
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

308
00:36:37.649 --> 00:36:39.523
-Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
-Hold station.

309
00:36:40.813 --> 00:36:42.560
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

310
00:37:03.374 --> 00:37:04.872
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.

311
00:37:09.659 --> 00:37:11.199
Take us out.

312
00:38:34.447 --> 00:38:38.111
Intermix set, bridge.
Impulse power at your discretion.

313
00:38:38.777 --> 00:38:40.317
Impulse power, Mr. Sulu.

314
00:38:42.856 --> 00:38:44.813
Ahead warp .5.

315
00:38:58.382 --> 00:38:59.839
Departure angle on viewer.

316
00:38:59.922 --> 00:39:01.213
Departure angle.

317
00:39:06.666 --> 00:39:08.123
Viewer ahead.

318
00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:09.870
Viewer ahead.

319
00:39:32.764 --> 00:39:36.511
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 7412.6.</i>

320
00:39:36.593 --> 00:39:39.049
<i>1.8 hours from launch.</i>

321
00:39:39.132 --> 00:39:43.170
<i>In order to intercept the intruder
at the earliest possible time,</i>

322
00:39:43.253 --> 00:39:47.333
<i>we must now risk engaging warp drive
while still within the solar system.</i>

323
00:39:47.416 --> 00:39:51.745
Captain, assuming
we have full warp capability,

324
00:39:51.828 --> 00:39:54.617
accelerating to warp 7
on leaving the solar system

325
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:59.071
will bring us to IP with the intruder
in 20.1 hours.

326
00:39:59.904 --> 00:40:02.817
Science officer's computation
confirmed, sir.

327
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:15.512
Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities
meet with your approval?

328
00:40:15.596 --> 00:40:16.803
They do not.

329
00:40:16.886 --> 00:40:19.009
It's like working
in a damned computer center.

330
00:40:19.092 --> 00:40:20.091
Programming ready?

331
00:40:20.175 --> 00:40:22.173
Program set for standard warp entry,
Captain.

332
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.544
But I still recommend
further simulation study.

333
00:40:26.127 --> 00:40:30.664
Mr. Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

334
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.660
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.

335
00:40:34.743 --> 00:40:37.365
<i>Captain, we need further warp simulation
on the flow sensors.</i>

336
00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:40.030
Engineer, we need warp speed now.

337
00:40:40.113 --> 00:40:41.112
Jim?

338
00:40:42.485 --> 00:40:43.734
You're pushing.

339
00:40:45.982 --> 00:40:47.647
Your people know their jobs.

340
00:40:49.186 --> 00:40:51.560
That's it, sir. I can't do any better.

341
00:40:53.516 --> 00:40:54.515
Aye, lad.

342
00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.133
It's borderline on the simulator, Captain.
I cannot guarantee that she'll hold up.

343
00:41:01.716 --> 00:41:02.965
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.

344
00:41:03.048 --> 00:41:04.505
Ahead, warp 1, Mr. Sulu.

345
00:41:04.587 --> 00:41:06.585
Accelerating to warp 1, sir.

346
00:41:09.542 --> 00:41:11.206
Warp .7.

347
00:41:12.579 --> 00:41:14.161
.8.

348
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:26.482
Warp 1, sir.

349
00:41:28.772 --> 00:41:32.018
-Mr. Decker...
-Emergency alert! Emergency alert!

350
00:41:32.102 --> 00:41:33.558
- <i>Emergency alert!</i>
-Worm hole.

351
00:41:34.724 --> 00:41:36.847
Get us back on impulse power.
Full reverse.

352
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.012
<i>Emergency alert! Emergency alert!</i>

353
00:41:42.924 --> 00:41:44.798
It's a redline. It needs backup!

354
00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:54.080
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power.

355
00:41:54.163 --> 00:41:57.534
Subspace frequencies jammed, sir.
Wormhole effect.

356
00:42:09.065 --> 00:42:12.145
Negative control from inertial lag
will continue 22.5 seconds

357
00:42:12.227 --> 00:42:14.476
before forward velocity slows
to sub-light speed.

358
00:42:14.559 --> 00:42:17.930
Unidentified small object has been pulled
into the wormhole with us, Captain,

359
00:42:18.014 --> 00:42:19.220
directly ahead.

360
00:42:19.304 --> 00:42:20.303
Force fields up full.

361
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.842
Put object on viewer.

362
00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:29.377
Go manual override on helm.

363
00:42:30.085 --> 00:42:31.250
No manual response, sir.

364
00:42:31.334 --> 00:42:33.831
Navigational deflectors coming up, sir.

365
00:42:33.914 --> 00:42:36.038
Wormhole distortion has overloaded
the main power systems.

366
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.576
Navigational deflectors inoperative,
Captain.

367
00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:42.156
Directional control also inoperative.

368
00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:51.188
Time to impact?

369
00:42:51.272 --> 00:42:54.019
Twenty seconds.

370
00:42:54.102 --> 00:42:57.433
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.

371
00:42:58.098 --> 00:42:59.805
No!

372
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.798
Belay that phaser order.

373
00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.618
Arm photon torpedoes!

374
00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:30.233
Photon torpedoes...

375
00:43:34.978 --> 00:43:37.059
armed!

376
00:43:42.844 --> 00:43:46.050
Object is an asteroid,

377
00:43:46.133 --> 00:43:48.673
reading mass .7.

378
00:43:51.752 --> 00:43:56.747
Targeting asteroid.

379
00:43:58.538 --> 00:44:01.826
Impact in ten seconds.

380
00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:11.233
Impact in eight seconds.

381
00:44:11.316 --> 00:44:13.231
Fire torpedoes!

382
00:44:13.314 --> 00:44:14.188
Six...

383
00:44:14.271 --> 00:44:17.768
Torpedoes away!

384
00:44:18.351 --> 00:44:19.433
Four!

385
00:44:47.696 --> 00:44:49.069
We're out of it.

386
00:44:55.189 --> 00:44:57.145
Helm control restored, sir.

387
00:45:00.641 --> 00:45:02.140
Position report, Navigator.

388
00:45:02.223 --> 00:45:04.429
Computing new intersection course.

389
00:45:04.512 --> 00:45:06.510
Communications are normal, sir.

390
00:45:06.594 --> 00:45:08.467
Negative damage reported, Captain.

391
00:45:09.049 --> 00:45:11.338
No casualties reported, Doctor.

392
00:45:11.422 --> 00:45:14.128
Wrong, Mr. Chekov. There are casualties.

393
00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:15.334
My Wits!

394
00:45:16.208 --> 00:45:19.830
As in "frightened out of," Captain, sir.

395
00:45:19.913 --> 00:45:21.370
We're at warp .8.

396
00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:23.951
Engineer, report your status there.

397
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.196
In just a second, Exec.
We're picking up the pieces down here.

398
00:45:30.611 --> 00:45:32.775
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

399
00:45:32.859 --> 00:45:35.023
Captain, it was the engine imbalance

400
00:45:35.106 --> 00:45:37.563
that created the wormhole
in the first place.

401
00:45:37.645 --> 00:45:39.601
<i>It will happen again
if we don't correct it.</i>

402
00:45:39.685 --> 00:45:41.724
That object is less than two days
away from Earth.

403
00:45:41.808 --> 00:45:43.973
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

404
00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:49.175
Navigator, lay in a new heading to conform
with our initial IP with the intruder.

405
00:45:50.174 --> 00:45:51.548
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

406
00:45:51.631 --> 00:45:52.630
Mr. Decker,

407
00:45:53.948 --> 00:45:55.654
I'd like to see you in my quarters.

408
00:45:55.738 --> 00:45:57.527
Mind if I tag along, Captain?

409
00:46:01.732 --> 00:46:03.022
Level five.

410
00:46:09.473 --> 00:46:11.721
Maintaining warp .8.

411
00:46:11.804 --> 00:46:15.675
I show our new heading as 287.3, mark 105.

412
00:46:17.423 --> 00:46:18.672
Lieutenant Ilia.

413
00:46:20.004 --> 00:46:21.003
Lieutenant.

414
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:27.496
Confirmed, Mr. Sulu. Confirmed.

415
00:46:36.654 --> 00:46:39.693
All right, explanation.
Why was my phaser order countermanded?

416
00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:42.440
Sir, the Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power

417
00:46:42.523 --> 00:46:44.271
by channeling it through the main engines.

418
00:46:45.228 --> 00:46:49.474
When they went into antimatter imbalance,
the phasers were automatically cut off.

419
00:46:53.678 --> 00:46:55.552
Then you acted properly, of course.

420
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.799
Thank you, sir.

421
00:46:59.964 --> 00:47:01.212
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

422
00:47:03.168 --> 00:47:05.708
-You saved the ship.
-I'm aware of that, sir.

423
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.662
Stop competing with me, Decker.

424
00:47:12.575 --> 00:47:14.491
-Permission to speak freely, sir?
-Granted.

425
00:47:14.573 --> 00:47:18.945
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour
in two and a half years.

426
00:47:19.777 --> 00:47:23.315
That, plus your unfamiliarity with
the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir,

427
00:47:23.399 --> 00:47:25.146
seriously jeopardizes this mission.

428
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.555
I trust you will

429
00:47:34.304 --> 00:47:36.927
nursemaid me
through these difficulties, mister?

430
00:47:37.967 --> 00:47:39.216
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

431
00:47:39.299 --> 00:47:41.921
Then I won't keep you from your duties
any longer, Commander.

432
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.878
-Yes, Doctor?
-Aye, sir.

433
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.619
He may be right, Jim.

434
00:48:02.068 --> 00:48:03.399
Was he difficult?

435
00:48:04.814 --> 00:48:06.064
No more than I expected.

436
00:48:06.147 --> 00:48:08.686
About as difficult as seeing you again.

437
00:48:10.934 --> 00:48:11.933
I'm sorry.

438
00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:14.639
That you left Delta IV?

439
00:48:14.722 --> 00:48:16.553
Or that you didn't even say goodbye?

440
00:48:19.467 --> 00:48:20.965
If I had seen you again,

441
00:48:22.838 --> 00:48:24.753
would you have been able to say it?

442
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.249
No.

443
00:48:41.403 --> 00:48:44.026
-And another thing.
-Get out of here, Bones.

444
00:48:45.149 --> 00:48:49.895
As ship's doctor, I am now discussing
the subject of command fitness.

445
00:48:49.978 --> 00:48:51.101
Make your point, Doctor.

446
00:48:51.726 --> 00:48:54.723
The point, Captain,
is that it's you who's competing.

447
00:48:55.264 --> 00:48:58.261
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

448
00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:01.799
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

449
00:49:01.883 --> 00:49:04.171
And I intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

450
00:49:04.255 --> 00:49:05.170
Yes.

451
00:49:06.295 --> 00:49:07.501
It's an obsession.

452
00:49:08.334 --> 00:49:09.999
An obsession that can blind you

453
00:49:10.082 --> 00:49:13.537
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

454
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.576
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

455
00:49:17.783 --> 00:49:18.906
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

456
00:49:20.062 --> 00:49:21.061
Viewer on.

457
00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:25.682
<i>Signal from a Federation-registered
long-range shuttle, sir.</i>

458
00:49:25.765 --> 00:49:28.804
<i>She wishes to come alongside and lock on.</i>

459
00:49:28.886 --> 00:49:29.844
For what purpose?

460
00:49:29.927 --> 00:49:34.048
<i>My security scan shows
it has a Grade 1 priority, Captain.</i>

461
00:49:34.132 --> 00:49:36.213
<i>Non-belligerency confirmed.</i>

462
00:49:36.295 --> 00:49:39.459
<i>I suspect it is a courier of some kind.</i>

463
00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:41.290
Very well, Mr. Chekov. See to it.

464
00:49:42.289 --> 00:49:43.746
Viewer off.

465
00:49:45.204 --> 00:49:47.284
Your opinion has been noted.

466
00:49:47.368 --> 00:49:48.492
Anything further?

467
00:49:50.281 --> 00:49:51.780
That depends on you.

468
00:51:06.705 --> 00:51:11.866
<i>Security scan. One boarder.
Identity, Starfleet, inactive.</i>

469
00:51:17.319 --> 00:51:19.358
Permission to come aboard, sir.

470
00:51:19.442 --> 00:51:23.313
Granted, sir. Gran... ted.

471
00:51:33.802 --> 00:51:35.925
Why, why, it's Mr...

472
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:37.008
Spock!

473
00:51:40.379 --> 00:51:42.377
Spock.

474
00:51:48.413 --> 00:51:50.785
Commander, if I may.

475
00:52:03.897 --> 00:52:07.394
I've been monitoring your communications
with Starfleet Command, Captain.

476
00:52:08.226 --> 00:52:10.765
I'm aware
of your engine design difficulties.

477
00:52:12.846 --> 00:52:15.261
I offer my services as science officer.

478
00:52:16.509 --> 00:52:18.174
With all due respect, Commander.

479
00:52:18.965 --> 00:52:20.505
If our exec has no objections?

480
00:52:20.588 --> 00:52:23.253
Of course not. I'm well aware
of Mr. Spock's qualifications.

481
00:52:23.336 --> 00:52:26.998
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.

482
00:52:27.623 --> 00:52:29.454
List him as science officer,

483
00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:32.951
both effective immediately.

484
00:52:34.075 --> 00:52:35.199
Mr. Spock.

485
00:52:35.282 --> 00:52:38.320
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.

486
00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:53.263
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.

487
00:52:53.347 --> 00:52:55.345
Captain, with your permission,

488
00:52:55.428 --> 00:52:58.134
I will now discuss these fuel equations
with the engineer.

489
00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:03.711
<i>MY- Spock'?</i>

490
00:53:04.668 --> 00:53:06.542
Welcome aboard.

491
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.705
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 7413.4.</i>

492
00:53:34.579 --> 00:53:37.827
<i>Thanks to Mr. Spock's timely arrival
and assistance,</i>

493
00:53:38.534 --> 00:53:42.114
<i>we have the engines rebalanced
into full warp capacity.</i>

494
00:53:42.197 --> 00:53:44.528
<i>Repair time, less than three hours.</i>

495
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:47.150
<i>Which means we will now be able
to intercept intruder</i>

496
00:53:47.234 --> 00:53:48.898
<i>while still more than a day from Earth.</i>

497
00:53:50.896 --> 00:53:52.520
Warp .8.

498
00:53:58.014 --> 00:53:59.055
.9.

499
00:54:07.379 --> 00:54:08.545
Warp 2, sir.

500
00:54:11.292 --> 00:54:12.291
<i>Warp 3.</i>

501
00:54:15.788 --> 00:54:16.912
<i>Warp 4.</i>

502
00:54:20.283 --> 00:54:21.449
Warp 5.

503
00:54:24.237 --> 00:54:25.154
<i>Warp 6.</i>

504
00:54:32.854 --> 00:54:34.186
Warp 7.

505
00:54:49.879 --> 00:54:53.333
Science Officer Spock,
reporting as ordered, Captain.

506
00:54:54.416 --> 00:54:55.373
Please, sit down.

507
00:54:57.496 --> 00:54:59.453
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

508
00:54:59.535 --> 00:55:02.116
You're just as warm and sociable as ever.

509
00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:03.823
Nor have you, Doctor,

510
00:55:04.613 --> 00:55:08.152
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

511
00:55:08.235 --> 00:55:09.401
Gentlemen.

512
00:55:12.064 --> 00:55:14.062
At last report, you were on Vulcan,

513
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:16.560
apparently to stay.

514
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:20.930
Yes, you were undergoing
the "Kolineer" discipline.

515
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.595
Sit down.

516
00:55:22.679 --> 00:55:27.008
If you are referring to the Kolinahr,
Doctor, you are correct.

517
00:55:27.799 --> 00:55:30.213
Well, however it's pronounced, Mr. Spock,

518
00:55:30.796 --> 00:55:35.624
it's the Vulcan ritual that's supposed
to purge all remaining emotions.

519
00:55:35.708 --> 00:55:37.955
The Kolinahr
is also a discipline you broke

520
00:55:38.954 --> 00:55:39.911
to join us.

521
00:55:42.283 --> 00:55:46.363
Will you please sit down?

522
00:55:57.477 --> 00:56:00.224
On Vulcan, I began sensing a consciousness

523
00:56:00.307 --> 00:56:03.554
from a source more powerful
than I have ever encountered.

524
00:56:03.638 --> 00:56:06.926
Thought patterns
of exactingly perfect order.

525
00:56:07.009 --> 00:56:09.091
I believe they emanate from the intruder.

526
00:56:10.006 --> 00:56:12.836
I believe it may hold my answers.

527
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.832
Well, isn't it lucky for you that
we just happen to be heading your way?

528
00:56:17.623 --> 00:56:18.622
Bones.

529
00:56:20.995 --> 00:56:22.202
We need him.

530
00:56:24.783 --> 00:56:25.740
I need him.

531
00:56:27.489 --> 00:56:30.402
Then my presence is
to our mutual advantage.

532
00:56:36.562 --> 00:56:38.852
Any thought patterns you might sense...

533
00:56:41.308 --> 00:56:43.389
whether they appear
to affect you personally or not,

534
00:56:43.472 --> 00:56:45.678
I expect immediately reported.

535
00:56:45.762 --> 00:56:46.927
Of course, Captain.

536
00:56:48.343 --> 00:56:50.382
Is there anything else?

537
00:56:50.465 --> 00:56:51.839
No.

538
00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:03.868
Jim?

539
00:57:07.573 --> 00:57:12.443
If this superintelligence
is as important to him as he says it is,

540
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:14.357
how do we know...

541
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:16.897
That he wouldn't put his own interests
ahead of the ship's?

542
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:21.933
I could never believe that.

543
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:25.346
<i>Bridge to officer's lounge.</i>

544
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:30.134
<i>Captain Kirk, revised estimate
on cloud visual contact, 3.7 minutes.</i>

545
00:57:30.216 --> 00:57:31.215
On my way.

546
00:57:31.299 --> 00:57:32.173
Jim.

547
00:57:35.587 --> 00:57:37.543
How do we know about any of us?

548
00:57:44.036 --> 00:57:46.450
<i>Red Alert! Red Alert!</i>

549
00:57:46.534 --> 00:57:48.156
<i>Red Alert! Red Alert!</i>

550
00:57:51.987 --> 00:57:56.606
<i>Red Alert! Red Alert! Red Alert!</i>

551
00:57:58.769 --> 00:58:00.184
Standard light, Engineer.

552
00:58:02.223 --> 00:58:04.263
-Full mag on viewer.
-Full mag, sir.

553
00:58:13.606 --> 00:58:14.605
Linguacode?

554
00:58:14.689 --> 00:58:17.270
Continuing friendship messages
on all frequencies, sir.

555
00:58:17.353 --> 00:58:19.726
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status Red.

556
00:58:19.809 --> 00:58:21.973
Captain, we are being scanned.

557
00:58:22.056 --> 00:58:23.971
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.

558
00:58:25.178 --> 00:58:27.010
Could be misinterpreted as hostility.

559
00:58:27.093 --> 00:58:30.340
Intruder scans emanating
from the exact center of the cloud.

560
00:58:31.089 --> 00:58:34.835
Energy of a type never before encountered.

561
00:58:43.535 --> 00:58:45.616
There's no response
to friendship messages, sir.

562
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.614
-Shall I go to battle stations, sir?
-Negative.

563
00:58:47.698 --> 00:58:49.362
We'll take no provocative action.

564
00:58:49.445 --> 00:58:52.442
Recommend defensive posture, Captain.
Screens and shields.

565
00:58:54.149 --> 00:58:55.439
No, Mr. Decker.

566
00:58:55.523 --> 00:58:58.436
That could also be misinterpreted
as hostile.

567
00:58:59.977 --> 00:59:02.266
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?

568
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:04.721
-Twelfth power energy field.
-Twelfth power?

569
00:59:04.805 --> 00:59:06.553
Captain, we've seen
what their weapons can do.

570
00:59:06.637 --> 00:59:08.176
Shouldn't we take
every possible precaution?

571
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.425
-Mr. Decker--
-Captain.

572
00:59:10.466 --> 00:59:13.712
I suspect there's an object
at the heart of that cloud.

573
00:59:18.582 --> 00:59:21.955
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough for you--

574
00:59:22.038 --> 00:59:26.034
Captain, as your exec,
it's my duty to point out alternatives.

575
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:29.322
Yes, it is.

576
00:59:31.028 --> 00:59:32.236
I stand corrected.

577
00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:34.275
Five minutes to cloud boundary.

578
00:59:34.359 --> 00:59:38.604
Navigator, lay in a conic section
flight path to the cloud center.

579
00:59:38.687 --> 00:59:42.309
Bring us parallel
to whatever we find in there.

580
00:59:42.392 --> 00:59:45.223
-Mr. Sulu, tactical plot on viewer.
-Tactical on viewer, sir.

581
01:00:00.624 --> 01:00:02.871
That measures 12th power energy?

582
01:00:04.745 --> 01:00:07.242
Thousands of starships
couldn't generate that much...

583
01:00:08.699 --> 01:00:09.698
Mr. Spock.

584
01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.442
Spock, tell me.

585
01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:27.500
I sense... puzzlement.

586
01:00:29.206 --> 01:00:30.664
We have been contacted.

587
01:00:32.953 --> 01:00:34.618
Why have we not replied?

588
01:00:35.534 --> 01:00:36.533
Contacted?

589
01:00:37.532 --> 01:00:38.572
How?

590
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:43.526
-Standard on viewer.
-Force fields up full. Deflectors, now.

591
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:47.355
<i>Mark, zero. Incoming fire ahead.</i>

592
01:00:47.438 --> 01:00:49.769
Force fields and deflectors up full,
Captain.

593
01:00:49.852 --> 01:00:51.100
Commencing evasive maneuvers.

594
01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:53.016
Helm disengaged from programmed course.

595
01:00:53.098 --> 01:00:56.387
Yaw 40 degrees to starboard,
30 degrees negative pitch.

596
01:00:56.471 --> 01:00:59.967
Synchronize all backup systems
and maintain standby status.

597
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.205
Engineer, number six inertial stabilizer
shows 18 seconds from failure.

598
01:01:12.288 --> 01:01:15.534
Starfleet Command, this is the Enterprise.
Do you read?

599
01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:17.616
Come in, please.

600
01:01:18.531 --> 01:01:20.738
<i>This is the Starship Enterprise.</i>

601
01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:23.360
Starfleet Command, do you read?

602
01:01:25.275 --> 01:01:26.607
Analysis, Mr. Spock.

603
01:01:27.397 --> 01:01:30.394
Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy,
Captain.

604
01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.434
Exact composition, unknown.

605
01:01:32.517 --> 01:01:34.931
Guidance system, unknown.

606
01:01:39.303 --> 01:01:40.801
Will our deflector screens hold it?

607
01:01:40.884 --> 01:01:42.216
Impossible to calculate.

608
01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:45.671
Yaw 30 degrees to port,
20 degrees positive pitch.

609
01:01:45.754 --> 01:01:48.293
Starfleet Command, this is the Enterprise.

610
01:01:48.376 --> 01:01:53.164
Transmitting linguacode
friendship messages on all channels.

611
01:01:53.246 --> 01:01:55.703
No reply to friendship messages.

612
01:01:56.243 --> 01:01:57.992
Starfleet, do you read?

613
01:01:58.075 --> 01:02:00.531
This is the Enterprise.
We are under attack.

614
01:02:02.987 --> 01:02:05.234
All decks brace for impact.

615
01:02:13.435 --> 01:02:15.682
Registering power loss on force fields!

616
01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.389
Engineering, what's happening
to our force fields?

617
01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:19.178
Systems overloading, Captain.

618
01:02:29.377 --> 01:02:31.166
Medic.

619
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.249
Medics are coming.

620
01:02:43.821 --> 01:02:45.403
The new screens held.

621
01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:49.148
Engineering to bridge.
Cannot hold full power on force fields.

622
01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.562
Deflector power is down 70%.

623
01:02:51.646 --> 01:02:53.935
Divert auxiliary power to deflectors.

624
01:02:56.432 --> 01:02:58.847
Oh, good, Christine. It's Chekov.

625
01:03:04.133 --> 01:03:05.132
Medic.

626
01:03:05.881 --> 01:03:07.504
I can stop his pain.

627
01:03:23.946 --> 01:03:25.153
Thank you.

628
01:03:41.842 --> 01:03:42.841
Captain.

629
01:03:44.465 --> 01:03:47.087
The intruder has been attempting
to communicate.

630
01:03:50.916 --> 01:03:53.955
Frequency more than one million megahertz.

631
01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.370
And at such a high rate of speed

632
01:03:55.454 --> 01:03:58.035
their entire message
lasts only a millisecond.

633
01:03:58.616 --> 01:04:01.448
Our previous transmission mode
was too primitive to be received.

634
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.819
I am now programming our computer
to transmit linguacode

635
01:04:04.902 --> 01:04:06.900
at their frequency and rate of speed.

636
01:04:09.356 --> 01:04:10.563
I'll take over, sir.

637
01:04:25.631 --> 01:04:26.921
Spock.

638
01:04:33.165 --> 01:04:34.372
Here it comes.

639
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.328
Engineering, status report.

640
01:04:36.412 --> 01:04:39.243
Our shields cannot handle another attack.

641
01:04:39.325 --> 01:04:40.741
Mr. Spock.

642
01:04:45.611 --> 01:04:47.317
Impact in 20 seconds.

643
01:04:49.732 --> 01:04:50.772
Spock.

644
01:04:50.855 --> 01:04:52.230
Fifteen seconds.

645
01:04:53.104 --> 01:04:55.185
Spock. Transmit now.

646
01:04:55.268 --> 01:04:56.975
Ten seconds.

647
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:58.889
Transmitting.

648
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:13.500
It would seem our friendship messages
have been received

649
01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:15.914
and understood, Mr. Spock.

650
01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:18.744
I would say
that was a logical assumption, Captain.

651
01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:21.658
One minute, 30 seconds to cloud boundary.

652
01:05:31.814 --> 01:05:33.104
Captain...

653
01:05:34.479 --> 01:05:37.476
we are obviously confronted by
a highly advanced mentality.

654
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:43.011
Yet, they cannot understand
who we are or what we want.

655
01:05:43.094 --> 01:05:45.467
And yet it would seem
that they understood our message.

656
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:47.049
They broke off the attack.

657
01:05:47.132 --> 01:05:49.380
They may have attacked
only as a warning to us, Captain.

658
01:05:49.463 --> 01:05:50.961
To keep away.

659
01:05:51.628 --> 01:05:55.333
That would presuppose a feeling,
Commander.

660
01:05:55.998 --> 01:05:56.997
Compassion.

661
01:05:58.495 --> 01:06:00.286
I sensed no emotion.

662
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.282
Only pure logic.

663
01:06:09.443 --> 01:06:11.275
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.

664
01:06:11.357 --> 01:06:13.314
Holding present position, sir.

665
01:06:13.397 --> 01:06:14.854
Tactical plot on viewer.

666
01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:16.977
Course projection on tactical, sir.

667
01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.077
Opinion, Mr. Spock.

668
01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.075
Recommend we proceed, Captain.

669
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.699
Mr. Decker?

670
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:30.405
I advise caution, Captain.

671
01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:33.111
We can't withstand another attack.

672
01:06:33.193 --> 01:06:36.898
That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.
We know nothing about it as yet.

673
01:06:36.982 --> 01:06:39.687
Precisely the point, Captain.
We don't know what it'll do.

674
01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:44.974
Moving into that cloud at this time
is an unwarranted gamble.

675
01:06:46.347 --> 01:06:48.886
How do you define "unwarranted"?

676
01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:53.923
You asked my opinion, sir.

677
01:07:01.831 --> 01:07:03.829
Viewer, standard ahead.

678
01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:14.485
Navigator, maintain course.

679
01:07:14.568 --> 01:07:15.567
Helmsman,

680
01:07:16.942 --> 01:07:18.606
steady as she goes.

681
01:09:31.514 --> 01:09:34.843
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

682
01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:37.633
Spock?

683
01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.585
Instruments fluctuating, Captain.

684
01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:48.081
Patterns unrecognizable.

685
01:11:31.749 --> 01:11:35.745
It could hold a crew of tens of thousands.

686
01:11:36.785 --> 01:11:39.782
Or a crew of a thousand, ten miles tall.

687
01:11:44.028 --> 01:11:45.651
I'll take over now.

688
01:11:46.401 --> 01:11:47.400
Aye, sir.

689
01:11:58.306 --> 01:11:59.721
Evaluation, Mr. Spock.

690
01:12:00.595 --> 01:12:01.594
Fascinating.

691
01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:07.005
That vessel is generating a force field
greater than the radiation of Earth's sun.

692
01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:14.248
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.

693
01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.579
Advise that we are attempting
further communication.

694
01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:25.861
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

695
01:12:26.361 --> 01:12:30.690
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud
is being reflected back.

696
01:12:32.313 --> 01:12:34.311
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.

697
01:12:42.969 --> 01:12:45.258
Reduce magnification,
factor four, Mr. Sulu.

698
01:12:46.215 --> 01:12:48.464
We're already two settings
below that, sir.

699
01:12:52.376 --> 01:12:53.584
Mr. Sulu,

700
01:12:54.957 --> 01:13:01.200
bring us into a parallel course
over the alien at 500 meters.

701
01:13:01.284 --> 01:13:02.949
500 meters?

702
01:13:04.364 --> 01:13:06.820
Then take us out
to 100 kilometers distance,

703
01:13:06.903 --> 01:13:08.735
adjusting parallel course.

704
01:13:10.317 --> 01:13:11.357
Aye, sir.

705
01:15:11.595 --> 01:15:14.967
-Viewer astern.
-Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

706
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.071
500 meters.

707
01:15:37.319 --> 01:15:38.985
Viewer ahead, sir.

708
01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.414
Hold relative position here.

709
01:18:11.413 --> 01:18:13.703
<i>Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!</i>

710
01:18:13.787 --> 01:18:16.826
<i>Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!</i>

711
01:18:16.908 --> 01:18:18.156
<i>Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!</i>

712
01:18:18.157 --> 01:18:19.697
<i>Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!</i>

713
01:18:19.781 --> 01:18:22.361
<i>Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!</i>

714
01:18:22.444 --> 01:18:23.777
<i>Intruder Alert!</i>

715
01:18:50.583 --> 01:18:55.369
Mr. Spock, can that be one of their crew?

716
01:18:55.952 --> 01:18:58.492
A probe from their vessel, Captain.

717
01:18:58.575 --> 01:19:00.697
Plasma-energy combination.

718
01:19:03.862 --> 01:19:05.486
Don't interfere with it!

719
01:19:06.068 --> 01:19:08.399
Absolutely, I will not interfere.

720
01:19:10.023 --> 01:19:11.604
No one interfere.

721
01:19:13.436 --> 01:19:15.683
It doesn't seem interested in us.

722
01:19:15.767 --> 01:19:17.056
Only the ship.

723
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.622
Computer off.

724
01:19:42.323 --> 01:19:44.363
It's taken control of the computer.

725
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:53.978
It's running our records.
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.

726
01:20:29.317 --> 01:20:30.358
Ilia!

727
01:20:34.937 --> 01:20:36.019
Ilia!

728
01:20:59.371 --> 01:21:01.660
This is how I define "unwarranted."

729
01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:14.480
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

730
01:21:19.725 --> 01:21:22.971
<i>Emergency Alert! Negative control at helm!</i>

731
01:21:23.055 --> 01:21:26.384
<i>Emergency Alert! Negative control at helm!</i>

732
01:21:26.468 --> 01:21:29.548
<i>Emergency Alert! Negative control at helm!</i>

733
01:21:29.632 --> 01:21:31.671
Force fields. Full remaining strength.
Total reserve.

734
01:21:31.755 --> 01:21:35.001
This ship is under attack.
Man all defensive stations.

735
01:21:40.953 --> 01:21:43.242
Captain, we've been seized
by a tractor beam.

736
01:21:43.326 --> 01:21:45.865
Get someone up here
to take the navigator's station.

737
01:21:45.948 --> 01:21:47.572
-Engineering.
-Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.

738
01:21:47.655 --> 01:21:48.778
-On the double.
-Emergency power.

739
01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:50.735
Going to full emergency!

740
01:21:52.233 --> 01:21:56.563
But, Captain, if we don't break free
in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.

741
01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.477
We cannot break free, Captain.

742
01:21:58.561 --> 01:22:00.766
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

743
01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:03.056
Engineering, belay that order.

744
01:22:03.139 --> 01:22:05.095
Disengage all main drive systems.

745
01:22:23.369 --> 01:22:26.574
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.

746
01:22:32.942 --> 01:22:35.523
DiFalco, disengage
engine navigation relays now.

747
01:22:35.606 --> 01:22:36.647
Aye, sir.

748
01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:40.310
Force field circuits E-10 through 14
show ready for reactivation.

749
01:22:40.394 --> 01:22:41.517
Confirm, please.

750
01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:45.222
Scotty, drive systems should be free now.

751
01:22:45.305 --> 01:22:46.679
Commander?

752
01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:48.635
Ready to launch
remote communications drone

753
01:22:48.718 --> 01:22:52.090
with complete ship's records,
including our present situation, sir.

754
01:22:52.173 --> 01:22:53.963
Delay launching as long as possible.

755
01:22:54.046 --> 01:22:56.585
Our drone can't escape
as long as we're held in their tractor.

756
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:57.668
Aye.

757
01:23:23.266 --> 01:23:26.639
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam

758
01:23:26.721 --> 01:23:28.886
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

759
01:23:28.969 --> 01:23:30.759
Break free to where, Commander?

760
01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.755
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

761
01:23:34.838 --> 01:23:36.420
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.

762
01:23:37.461 --> 01:23:39.001
Why are you opposed to trying?

763
01:24:30.074 --> 01:24:31.822
Why bring us inside?

764
01:24:32.613 --> 01:24:36.026
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

765
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:37.899
They still can.

766
01:24:37.983 --> 01:24:40.231
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.

767
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:44.351
Insatiable curiosity.

768
01:24:52.552 --> 01:24:56.214
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

769
01:24:57.296 --> 01:24:58.670
We're trapped, sir.

770
01:24:59.919 --> 01:25:01.875
Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

771
01:25:27.308 --> 01:25:29.264
Tractor beam has released us, Captain.

772
01:25:30.222 --> 01:25:31.221
Confirmed.

773
01:25:31.304 --> 01:25:32.844
Vessel is floating free.

774
01:25:32.928 --> 01:25:34.550
No forward momentum.

775
01:25:37.006 --> 01:25:38.172
Viewer ahead.

776
01:25:38.255 --> 01:25:39.545
Viewer ahead, sir.

777
01:25:45.456 --> 01:25:47.246
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

778
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:48.495
Ahead one-third.

779
01:25:48.578 --> 01:25:50.909
Thrusters ahead, one-third.

780
01:25:56.403 --> 01:25:57.778
Let's take a look.

781
01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:59.359
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.

782
01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:02.273
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

783
01:26:02.356 --> 01:26:03.812
Now that we're looking down their throat.

784
01:26:03.896 --> 01:26:06.685
Right. Now that we've got them
just where they want us.

785
01:26:23.876 --> 01:26:25.249
It's closing up.

786
01:26:28.538 --> 01:26:30.494
Hold position.

787
01:26:30.578 --> 01:26:32.908
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

788
01:26:35.115 --> 01:26:36.405
Captain.

789
01:26:40.234 --> 01:26:42.982
All our scans are being reflected back.

790
01:26:43.065 --> 01:26:44.771
Sensors are useless.

791
01:26:46.021 --> 01:26:47.186
Damn!

792
01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:56.885
What do you make of all this?

793
01:26:56.968 --> 01:27:00.048
I believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber.

794
01:27:00.589 --> 01:27:03.711
Undoubtedly,
part of the vessel's inner mechanism.

795
01:27:03.795 --> 01:27:06.583
I suspect it may be necessary...

796
01:27:11.145 --> 01:27:14.725
- <i>Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!</i>
-Deck 5, Captain. Officers quarters.

797
01:27:14.808 --> 01:27:16.890
Have Security meet me at deck 5.
Main elevator.

798
01:27:16.972 --> 01:27:18.887
Spock. Mr. Decker, you have the conn.

799
01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:20.802
- <i>Whatever it is, it's white hot.</i>
-Hold position.

800
01:27:20.885 --> 01:27:23.591
<i>Intruder location, a sonic shower.</i>

801
01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:28.835
<i>Temperature at intruder location,
temperature drop rapid now.</i>

802
01:27:28.919 --> 01:27:30.626
<i>60 degrees.</i>

803
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:34.788
<i>50 degrees. Temperature curve flattening.</i>

804
01:27:34.871 --> 01:27:39.325
<i>45 degrees. 40 degrees.</i>

805
01:27:39.408 --> 01:27:42.655
<i>Temperature leveling, 39 degrees.</i>

806
01:27:42.739 --> 01:27:46.526
You are the Kirk unit. You will assist me.

807
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:48.857
<i>Holding at 37.65 degrees.</i>

808
01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:53.561
I've been programmed by V'Ger
to observe and record

809
01:27:53.644 --> 01:27:56.682
normal functions of the carbon-based units

810
01:27:56.765 --> 01:27:59.305
<i>infesting USS Enterprise.</i>

811
01:27:59.388 --> 01:28:03.135
<i>Holding at 37.65 degrees.</i>

812
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:14.123
-Jim, what's going on?
-Tricorder.

813
01:28:18.313 --> 01:28:21.518
Who is... V'Ger?

814
01:28:22.392 --> 01:28:24.764
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

815
01:28:26.263 --> 01:28:29.676
Is V'Ger the name of the captain
of the alien vessel?

816
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:33.755
Jim, this is a mechanism.

817
01:28:33.839 --> 01:28:35.129
A probe, Captain.

818
01:28:37.626 --> 01:28:42.289
No doubt, a sensor-transceiver combination
recording everything we say and do.

819
01:28:43.745 --> 01:28:45.035
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?

820
01:28:45.702 --> 01:28:47.741
That unit no longer functions.

821
01:28:47.825 --> 01:28:50.738
I've been given its form
to more readily communicate

822
01:28:50.822 --> 01:28:54.776
with the carbon-based units
infesting Enterprise.

823
01:28:54.859 --> 01:28:56.691
Carbon-based units?

824
01:28:56.774 --> 01:28:58.980
Humans, Ensign Perez.

825
01:28:59.063 --> 01:29:00.229
Us.

826
01:29:01.145 --> 01:29:06.472
Why does V'Ger travel to the third planet
of the solar system directly ahead?

827
01:29:06.556 --> 01:29:08.762
To find the Creator.

828
01:29:08.845 --> 01:29:11.093
Find the Creator?

829
01:29:12.924 --> 01:29:14.006
Who's...

830
01:29:17.836 --> 01:29:19.875
What does V'Ger want with the Creator?

831
01:29:19.959 --> 01:29:21.624
To join with him.

832
01:29:21.707 --> 01:29:23.871
To join with the Creator?

833
01:29:23.955 --> 01:29:25.037
How?

834
01:29:25.121 --> 01:29:27.742
V'Ger and the Creator will become one.

835
01:29:27.826 --> 01:29:29.616
And who is the Creator?

836
01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:32.238
The Creator is that which created V'Ger.

837
01:29:32.321 --> 01:29:33.570
Who is V'Ger?

838
01:29:33.653 --> 01:29:36.192
V'Ger is that which seeks the Creator.

839
01:29:40.646 --> 01:29:44.018
I'm ready to commence my observations.

840
01:29:44.101 --> 01:29:47.680
Doctor, a thorough examination
of this probe might provide some insight

841
01:29:47.764 --> 01:29:50.719
into those who manufactured it
and how to deal with them.

842
01:29:51.927 --> 01:29:54.341
Fine. Let's get her to sickbay.

843
01:29:58.669 --> 01:30:01.000
I am programmed to observe and record

844
01:30:01.084 --> 01:30:03.831
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

845
01:30:03.915 --> 01:30:08.285
The examination is a normal function.

846
01:30:11.074 --> 01:30:12.655
You may proceed.

847
01:30:19.024 --> 01:30:21.314
Micro-miniature hydraulics...

848
01:30:24.311 --> 01:30:25.642
sensors...

849
01:30:30.055 --> 01:30:33.260
and molecule-sized multi-processor chips.

850
01:30:38.421 --> 01:30:39.712
And take a look at this.

851
01:30:39.794 --> 01:30:43.000
Osmotic micro-pump right here.

852
01:30:43.083 --> 01:30:46.205
And even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

853
01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:52.324
Every exocrine system is the same too.

854
01:30:53.739 --> 01:30:55.238
Even eye moisture.

855
01:30:56.196 --> 01:30:58.401
Decker.

856
01:30:59.484 --> 01:31:02.314
Fascinating. Not "Decker unit."

857
01:31:07.476 --> 01:31:08.724
Gentlemen.

858
01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.639
Will.

859
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:22.960
What happened to her?

860
01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:26.457
Captain, this probe may be our key
to the aliens.

861
01:31:26.539 --> 01:31:27.705
Probe?

862
01:31:27.788 --> 01:31:29.578
-Ilia?
-Exactly.

863
01:31:29.661 --> 01:31:31.826
It is a programmed mechanism, Commander.

864
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:35.697
Its body duplicates our navigator
in precise detail.

865
01:31:35.781 --> 01:31:37.986
Suppose that beneath its programming,

866
01:31:38.069 --> 01:31:41.816
the real Ilia's memory patterns
are duplicated with equal precision.

867
01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:44.272
-They had a pattern to follow.
-Indeed.

868
01:31:44.855 --> 01:31:47.060
They may have followed it too precisely.

869
01:31:47.144 --> 01:31:48.642
Ilia's memory,

870
01:31:49.225 --> 01:31:51.848
her feelings
of loyalty, obedience, friendship

871
01:31:52.597 --> 01:31:54.345
might all be there.

872
01:31:55.052 --> 01:31:59.007
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

873
01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:01.755
That probe, in another form,
is what killed Ilia!

874
01:32:01.837 --> 01:32:02.878
Commander!

875
01:32:03.753 --> 01:32:07.873
Will, we're locked in an alien vessel,
six hours from Earth orbit.

876
01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:10.246
Our only contact with our captor
is that probe.

877
01:32:10.328 --> 01:32:12.618
If we could control it,
persuade it, use it...

878
01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.404
I have recorded enough here.

879
01:32:18.487 --> 01:32:20.402
You will now assist me further.

880
01:32:23.691 --> 01:32:27.978
The Decker unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

881
01:32:33.347 --> 01:32:35.719
Carry on with your assignment, Mr. Decker.

882
01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.551
Aye, sir.

883
01:32:43.118 --> 01:32:47.322
I am concerned with that being
our only source of information, Captain.

884
01:32:51.609 --> 01:32:54.440
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 7414.1.</i>

885
01:32:55.064 --> 01:32:59.060
<i>Our best estimates place us
some four hours from Earth.</i>

886
01:32:59.143 --> 01:33:01.142
<i>No significant progress thus far</i>

887
01:33:01.225 --> 01:33:04.430
<i>reviving Ilia memory patterns
within the alien probe.</i>

888
01:33:05.054 --> 01:33:08.968
<i>This remains our only means of contact
with our captor.</i>

889
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:11.257
All those vessels were called Enterprise.

890
01:33:23.036 --> 01:33:25.867
The carbon units use this area
for recreation.

891
01:33:27.074 --> 01:33:29.072
This is one of the games.

892
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:37.438
What types of recreation
does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

893
01:33:38.729 --> 01:33:40.810
The words "recreation"

894
01:33:42.059 --> 01:33:43.474
and "enjoy"

895
01:33:44.431 --> 01:33:46.596
have no meaning to my programming.

896
01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:56.835
Ilia enjoyed this game.

897
01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:00.748
She nearly always won.

898
01:34:06.618 --> 01:34:09.864
Good. He's using audio-visual association.

899
01:34:46.202 --> 01:34:48.409
This device serves no purpose.

900
01:34:59.896 --> 01:35:03.102
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

901
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:07.265
Enterprise would be unable to function
without carbon units.

902
01:35:08.555 --> 01:35:11.760
More data concerning this functioning
is necessary

903
01:35:11.843 --> 01:35:15.839
before carbon units can be patterned
for data storage.

904
01:35:19.876 --> 01:35:21.291
What does that mean?

905
01:35:21.999 --> 01:35:24.455
When my examination is complete,

906
01:35:24.539 --> 01:35:28.326
all carbon units will be reduced
to data patterns.

907
01:35:28.993 --> 01:35:34.154
Within you are the memory patterns
of a certain carbon unit.

908
01:35:34.237 --> 01:35:37.110
If I can help you
to revive those patterns,

909
01:35:37.192 --> 01:35:39.232
you could understand our functions better.

910
01:35:40.356 --> 01:35:42.396
That is logical.

911
01:35:42.479 --> 01:35:44.227
You may proceed.

912
01:36:34.967 --> 01:36:37.090
Computer, commence recording.

913
01:36:38.131 --> 01:36:44.750
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail
my attempt to contact the aliens.

914
01:36:51.451 --> 01:36:56.778
<i>Warning! Your emergency evacuation
thruster pack has been armed.</i>

915
01:36:56.862 --> 01:37:02.481
<i>Once ignited, the burn duration is
10 seconds and may not be aborted.</i>

916
01:37:02.565 --> 01:37:06.810
<i>Push the igniter-enable release
to begin a 10-second countdown</i>

917
01:37:06.893 --> 01:37:08.434
<i>to thruster ignition.</i>

918
01:37:08.517 --> 01:37:12.762
<i>To abort countdown,
flip the control arm up.</i>

919
01:37:12.846 --> 01:37:16.175
I intend to calculate thruster ignition
and acceleration rate

920
01:37:16.259 --> 01:37:18.881
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

921
01:37:18.965 --> 01:37:22.919
This should facilitate a better view
of the interior of the alien spacecraft.

922
01:37:28.663 --> 01:37:29.662
Captain?

923
01:37:29.745 --> 01:37:32.159
Starfleet signals
are growing in strength, sir.

924
01:37:32.243 --> 01:37:34.615
They still have the intruder
on their monitors.

925
01:37:34.699 --> 01:37:36.989
-It's decelerating.
-Confirmed, sir.

926
01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:40.485
Lunar beacons indicate intruder
on a course into Earth orbit.

927
01:37:40.568 --> 01:37:43.898
Sir, airlock 4 has been opened.

928
01:37:43.981 --> 01:37:46.603
A thruster suit is reported missing.

929
01:37:49.018 --> 01:37:50.309
A thruster suit?

930
01:37:52.556 --> 01:37:53.555
That's Spock.

931
01:37:54.679 --> 01:37:55.678
Damn him.

932
01:37:56.552 --> 01:37:57.551
Bring him back here.

933
01:37:58.259 --> 01:37:59.258
No, wait.

934
01:38:06.916 --> 01:38:09.372
-Get a fix on his position.
-Aye, sir.

935
01:38:19.071 --> 01:38:20.486
I don't want him stopped.

936
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:22.568
I want him to lead me
to whatever's out there.

937
01:38:22.651 --> 01:38:24.815
And if that "whatever"
has taken over his mind?

938
01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:26.896
Then he'll still have led me to it,
won't he?

939
01:39:26.212 --> 01:39:27.502
I have him in sight.

940
01:40:39.905 --> 01:40:43.567
I have successfully penetrated
the next chamber of the alien's interior,

941
01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:46.815
and I'm witnessing
some sort of dimensional image

942
01:40:46.898 --> 01:40:51.102
which I believe to be a representation
of V'Ger's home planet.

943
01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:00.884
I'm passing through a connecting tunnel.

944
01:41:00.967 --> 01:41:04.214
Apparently,
a kind of plasma energy conduit,

945
01:41:05.046 --> 01:41:08.210
possibly a field coil
for a gigantic imaging system.

946
01:41:19.074 --> 01:41:20.281
Curious.

947
01:41:20.364 --> 01:41:22.445
I'm seeing images of planets,

948
01:41:22.528 --> 01:41:25.151
moons, stars, whole galaxies,

949
01:41:25.235 --> 01:41:27.107
all stored here, recorded.

950
01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:29.812
It could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

951
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:39.553
But who or what are we dealing with?

952
01:41:39.637 --> 01:41:43.798
The Epsilon IX station,
stored here with every detail.

953
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:55.495
Captain, I am now quite convinced
that all of this is V'Ger,

954
01:41:56.203 --> 01:41:59.241
that we are inside a living machine.

955
01:42:04.694 --> 01:42:05.776
Ilia.

956
01:42:10.855 --> 01:42:15.766
The sensor must contain
some special meaning.

957
01:42:19.637 --> 01:42:21.428
I must try to mind-meld with it.

958
01:43:14.985 --> 01:43:16.026
Spock.

959
01:43:17.067 --> 01:43:18.148
Spock!

960
01:43:19.689 --> 01:43:21.187
Spock!

961
01:43:29.055 --> 01:43:33.342
I remember Lieutenant Ilia
once mentioned she wore this.

962
01:43:33.883 --> 01:43:35.090
When we met.

963
01:43:44.165 --> 01:43:44.998
Put it on.

964
01:44:25.082 --> 01:44:26.497
Ilia?

965
01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:27.787
On Delta.

966
01:44:29.619 --> 01:44:30.618
Remember?

967
01:44:38.818 --> 01:44:42.231
Dr. Chapel.

968
01:44:53.261 --> 01:44:54.260
Will?

969
01:44:56.051 --> 01:44:57.257
Ilia.

970
01:44:58.714 --> 01:45:00.129
Commander.

971
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:02.877
Commander!

972
01:45:05.749 --> 01:45:07.372
This is a mechanism.

973
01:45:11.327 --> 01:45:12.326
Ilia...

974
01:45:14.282 --> 01:45:17.737
help us make direct contact with V'Ger.

975
01:45:18.569 --> 01:45:19.735
I cannot.

976
01:45:20.692 --> 01:45:23.522
This Creator V'Ger is looking for...

977
01:45:24.688 --> 01:45:25.520
What is it?

978
01:45:26.728 --> 01:45:29.100
V'Ger does not know.

979
01:45:34.137 --> 01:45:37.842
But the Creator is on the third planet.

980
01:45:40.339 --> 01:45:44.169
V'Ger has data which confirms this.

981
01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:04.606
Why have two carbon units entered V'Ger?

982
01:46:07.187 --> 01:46:08.602
They want to contact V'Ger.

983
01:46:08.686 --> 01:46:09.892
Ilia.

984
01:46:15.554 --> 01:46:18.300
Does V'Ger object to the presence
of the two carbon units?

985
01:46:18.384 --> 01:46:21.506
The carbon units are of no consequence.

986
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:23.795
V'Ger will determine their purpose.

987
01:46:25.044 --> 01:46:27.417
Their purpose is to survive.

988
01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.789
That is also V'Ger's purpose.

989
01:46:30.955 --> 01:46:35.658
You said V'Ger's purpose
was to find and join with the Creator.

990
01:46:36.324 --> 01:46:38.531
That is how he will survive.

991
01:46:46.772 --> 01:46:49.436
I wish to continue my observations.

992
01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:06.460
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fiber connection.

993
01:47:10.414 --> 01:47:13.662
Indications of some neurological trauma.

994
01:47:14.244 --> 01:47:17.658
The power pouring through that mind-meld
must have been staggering.

995
01:47:25.233 --> 01:47:26.315
Spock.

996
01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.022
Jim.

997
01:47:31.102 --> 01:47:32.934
I should have known.

998
01:47:33.516 --> 01:47:36.347
Were you right? About V'Ger?

999
01:47:37.596 --> 01:47:39.594
A life-form of its own.

1000
01:47:40.967 --> 01:47:43.506
A conscious, living entity.

1001
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:45.005
A living machine?

1002
01:47:45.088 --> 01:47:46.961
It considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

1003
01:47:47.045 --> 01:47:49.250
That's why the probe refers to our ship
as an entity.

1004
01:47:49.574 --> 01:47:51.696
I saw V'Ger's planet,

1005
01:47:52.903 --> 01:47:56.275
a planet populated by living machines.

1006
01:47:56.358 --> 01:47:58.439
Unbelievable technology.

1007
01:48:01.062 --> 01:48:04.433
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

1008
01:48:06.139 --> 01:48:10.344
And yet, with all its pure logic,

1009
01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:14.673
V'Ger is barren, cold.

1010
01:48:14.756 --> 01:48:16.421
No mystery.

1011
01:48:18.044 --> 01:48:19.460
No beauty.

1012
01:48:22.706 --> 01:48:25.578
I should've known.

1013
01:48:27.118 --> 01:48:28.368
Known?

1014
01:48:29.574 --> 01:48:31.406
Known what? Spock.

1015
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.654
-Captain.
-Bones!

1016
01:48:38.398 --> 01:48:40.147
Spock.

1017
01:48:40.231 --> 01:48:41.854
What should you have known?

1018
01:48:42.561 --> 01:48:44.227
What should you have known?

1019
01:48:48.971 --> 01:48:50.637
Jim.

1020
01:48:54.549 --> 01:48:58.213
This simple feeling...

1021
01:48:59.919 --> 01:49:02.708
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

1022
01:49:10.866 --> 01:49:12.490
No meaning.

1023
01:49:12.573 --> 01:49:13.821
No hope.

1024
01:49:15.029 --> 01:49:16.194
And, Jim,

1025
01:49:17.734 --> 01:49:19.399
no answers.

1026
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:22.979
It's asking questions.

1027
01:49:23.062 --> 01:49:24.561
What questions?

1028
01:49:24.643 --> 01:49:28.432
"ls this all that I am?

1029
01:49:29.638 --> 01:49:31.720
Is there nothing more?"

1030
01:49:37.630 --> 01:49:39.005
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

1031
01:49:42.792 --> 01:49:43.875
Kirk here.

1032
01:49:43.958 --> 01:49:46.913
A faint signal from Starfleet, sir.

1033
01:49:46.997 --> 01:49:49.785
Intruder cloud has been located
on their outer monitors

1034
01:49:49.869 --> 01:49:51.950
for the past 27 minutes.

1035
01:49:52.032 --> 01:49:55.612
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

1036
01:49:55.696 --> 01:49:59.317
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

1037
01:49:59.401 --> 01:50:01.357
We are three minutes from Earth orbit.

1038
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:02.938
I'll be right there.

1039
01:50:07.559 --> 01:50:09.682
I need Spock on the bridge.

1040
01:50:09.765 --> 01:50:11.929
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

1041
01:50:13.511 --> 01:50:18.215
A machine planet
sending a machine to Earth...

1042
01:50:20.255 --> 01:50:22.711
looking for its Creator.

1043
01:50:25.332 --> 01:50:27.622
It's absolutely incredible.

1044
01:50:31.618 --> 01:50:34.407
Mr. Chekov,
Commander Decker's present location?

1045
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:37.404
<i>He... They are in engineering, sir.</i>

1046
01:50:46.811 --> 01:50:50.432
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

1047
01:50:52.222 --> 01:50:55.427
V'Ger is transmitting... a signal.

1048
01:50:57.467 --> 01:50:58.757
Jim.

1049
01:50:59.923 --> 01:51:00.922
From V'Ger?

1050
01:51:05.584 --> 01:51:08.206
V'Ger signals the Creator.

1051
01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:23.441
Spock?

1052
01:51:25.105 --> 01:51:27.603
A simple binary code

1053
01:51:27.686 --> 01:51:30.434
transmitted by carrier wave signal.

1054
01:51:31.849 --> 01:51:33.306
Radio.

1055
01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:36.345
Radio?

1056
01:51:41.547 --> 01:51:43.087
Jim.

1057
01:51:43.171 --> 01:51:46.043
V'Ger expects an answer.

1058
01:51:47.125 --> 01:51:48.333
An answer?

1059
01:51:48.415 --> 01:51:50.039
I don't know the question.

1060
01:51:51.746 --> 01:51:54.201
The Creator has not responded.

1061
01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:11.975
All planetary defense systems
have just gone inoperative.

1062
01:52:51.914 --> 01:52:55.826
Sir, Starfleet computes
the devices are proceeding

1063
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:58.948
toward equidistant positions,
orbiting the planet.

1064
01:52:59.031 --> 01:53:00.696
They're the same things that hit us.

1065
01:53:00.779 --> 01:53:03.610
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

1066
01:53:03.693 --> 01:53:04.941
From those positions,

1067
01:53:05.025 --> 01:53:07.564
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

1068
01:53:20.843 --> 01:53:21.842
Why?

1069
01:53:22.507 --> 01:53:24.755
The Creator has not answered.

1070
01:53:24.838 --> 01:53:28.668
The carbon-unit infestation is to be
removed from the Creator's planet.

1071
01:53:28.751 --> 01:53:29.667
Why?

1072
01:53:30.292 --> 01:53:32.664
<i>You infest Enterprise.</i>

1073
01:53:32.747 --> 01:53:35.453
You interfere with the Creator
in the same manner.

1074
01:53:35.536 --> 01:53:38.159
Carbon units are not an infestation.

1075
01:53:39.449 --> 01:53:43.735
They are a natural function
of the Creator's planet.

1076
01:53:44.652 --> 01:53:45.693
They are living things.

1077
01:53:46.442 --> 01:53:48.648
They are not true life-forms.

1078
01:53:49.148 --> 01:53:52.310
Only the Creator
and other similar life-forms are true.

1079
01:53:52.394 --> 01:53:54.517
Similar life-forms.

1080
01:53:55.765 --> 01:53:59.512
Jim, V'Ger is saying
its Creator is a machine.

1081
01:54:00.136 --> 01:54:01.135
Of course.

1082
01:54:03.924 --> 01:54:06.505
We all create God in our own image.

1083
01:54:08.877 --> 01:54:10.501
Machine.

1084
01:54:14.205 --> 01:54:15.413
V'Ger.

1085
01:54:16.495 --> 01:54:17.494
V'Ger!

1086
01:54:28.191 --> 01:54:29.190
Captain.

1087
01:54:34.227 --> 01:54:36.850
V'Ger is a child.

1088
01:54:37.682 --> 01:54:39.471
I suggest you treat her as such.

1089
01:54:39.555 --> 01:54:42.635
-A child?
-Yes, Captain. A child.

1090
01:54:43.426 --> 01:54:46.756
Evolving, learning, searching,

1091
01:54:47.755 --> 01:54:49.795
instinctively needing.

1092
01:54:49.878 --> 01:54:51.335
Needing what?

1093
01:54:51.418 --> 01:54:52.417
Spock,

1094
01:54:52.728 --> 01:54:56.390
this child is about to wipe out
every living thing on Earth.

1095
01:54:57.098 --> 01:55:00.179
Now, what do you suggest we do? Spank it?

1096
01:55:03.342 --> 01:55:05.715
It knows only that it needs, Commander.

1097
01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.628
But like so many of us,

1098
01:55:09.877 --> 01:55:11.750
it does not know what.

1099
01:55:25.029 --> 01:55:28.525
The carbon units know
why the Creator has not responded.

1100
01:55:31.813 --> 01:55:33.853
Disclose the information.

1101
01:55:33.936 --> 01:55:37.640
Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices
orbiting the third planet.

1102
01:55:37.724 --> 01:55:38.723
Captain!

1103
01:55:41.761 --> 01:55:45.341
I'm losing Starfleet.
Interference from V'Ger.

1104
01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:50.211
Kirk unit, disclose the information.

1105
01:55:50.295 --> 01:55:54.000
Why has the Creator not responded?

1106
01:55:54.082 --> 01:55:55.290
No.

1107
01:55:59.411 --> 01:56:02.157
Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.

1108
01:56:05.487 --> 01:56:07.152
Clear the bridge, Captain?

1109
01:56:07.902 --> 01:56:09.733
That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
Clear the bridge.

1110
01:56:09.817 --> 01:56:11.023
Aye, sir.

1111
01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:21.638
Your child is having a tantrum, Mr. Spock.

1112
01:56:23.262 --> 01:56:25.425
V'Ger requires the information.

1113
01:56:28.838 --> 01:56:31.628
Bridge. Secure all stations. Move out.

1114
01:56:31.711 --> 01:56:34.292
Jim,
what the hell kind of strategy is this?

1115
01:56:35.873 --> 01:56:38.329
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

1116
01:56:38.412 --> 01:56:40.036
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise,

1117
01:56:40.119 --> 01:56:42.575
the information that V'Ger requires
will also be destroyed.

1118
01:56:42.659 --> 01:56:45.905
It is illogical
to withhold required information.

1119
01:56:46.696 --> 01:56:48.319
Kirk unit!

1120
01:56:48.402 --> 01:56:49.610
Kirk unit.

1121
01:56:53.023 --> 01:56:55.063
Why do you not disclose information?

1122
01:56:59.225 --> 01:57:02.555
Because V'Ger's going to destroy
all the carbon units on the third planet.

1123
01:57:02.639 --> 01:57:04.553
They have repressed the Creator.

1124
01:57:04.636 --> 01:57:07.258
The information will not be disclosed.

1125
01:57:08.299 --> 01:57:10.339
V'Ger needs the information.

1126
01:57:10.422 --> 01:57:15.542
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

1127
01:57:16.249 --> 01:57:21.244
V'Ger will comply if the carbon units
will disclose the information.

1128
01:57:27.696 --> 01:57:29.819
It learns fast, doesn't it?

1129
01:57:29.903 --> 01:57:31.234
Captain,

1130
01:57:31.318 --> 01:57:33.191
the vessel, V'Ger,

1131
01:57:33.274 --> 01:57:37.145
obviously operates
from a central brain complex.

1132
01:57:37.228 --> 01:57:39.975
The orbiting devices would be controlled
from that point then?

1133
01:57:40.058 --> 01:57:41.224
Precisely.

1134
01:57:51.422 --> 01:57:55.210
The carbon unit's information
cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe,

1135
01:57:55.294 --> 01:57:58.291
but only to V'Ger directly.

1136
01:58:21.267 --> 01:58:23.640
Forward motion, Captain.

1137
01:58:23.722 --> 01:58:24.847
Tractor beam.

1138
01:58:42.162 --> 01:58:45.159
Captain, what's the next move?

1139
01:58:46.866 --> 01:58:50.695
The question is, Mr. Decker,
is there a next move?

1140
01:58:53.901 --> 01:58:55.565
Resume duty stations.

1141
01:58:57.022 --> 01:58:58.854
All personnel, resume stations.

1142
01:59:04.265 --> 01:59:05.514
Well, Mr. Decker,

1143
01:59:06.513 --> 01:59:08.511
it seems my bluff has been called.

1144
01:59:10.343 --> 01:59:13.048
I'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

1145
01:59:17.294 --> 01:59:20.749
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

1146
01:59:21.528 --> 01:59:24.317
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.

1147
01:59:47.544 --> 01:59:48.543
Engineering.

1148
01:59:48.626 --> 01:59:49.625
<i>Scott here.</i>

1149
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:55.369
Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute
Starfleet order 2-0-0-5.

1150
01:59:56.201 --> 01:59:57.242
When, sir?

1151
01:59:59.198 --> 02:00:00.322
On my command.

1152
02:00:00.405 --> 02:00:01.404
Aye, sir.

1153
02:00:03.902 --> 02:00:06.774
Why has the captain
ordered self-destruct, sir?

1154
02:00:06.857 --> 02:00:08.647
I would say, lass, because he thinks--

1155
02:00:09.230 --> 02:00:14.059
He hopes that when we go up,
we'll take the intruder with us.

1156
02:00:14.141 --> 02:00:15.140
Will We?

1157
02:00:15.224 --> 02:00:17.472
When that much matter and antimatter
are brought together,

1158
02:00:17.555 --> 02:00:19.969
oh, yes, we will indeed.

1159
02:00:22.175 --> 02:00:26.213
Eighteen minutes
to device activation, sir.

1160
02:00:27.711 --> 02:00:30.375
<i>Gravity control,
give me an all-decks readout.</i>

1161
02:00:32.123 --> 02:00:35.329
Starfleet has been apprised
of our situation, Captain.

1162
02:00:35.912 --> 02:00:39.824
<i>Crew status is 172 at duty stations,</i>

1163
02:00:39.908 --> 02:00:43.904
<i>248 off-duty, 11 in sickbay, all minor.</i>

1164
02:00:43.986 --> 02:00:46.109
Tractor beam remains constant.

1165
02:00:48.899 --> 02:00:52.353
We are 17 kilometers inside the vessel.

1166
02:00:53.019 --> 02:00:55.767
<i>Engineering,
show me your pylon stress readings.</i>

1167
02:00:56.599 --> 02:01:01.343
<i>Deck 4, that temperature
should read 1-0-1-3 degrees.</i>

1168
02:01:01.427 --> 02:01:02.842
<i>Please confirm.</i>

1169
02:01:10.668 --> 02:01:11.833
Spock?

1170
02:01:15.247 --> 02:01:16.370
Mr. Spock.

1171
02:01:17.245 --> 02:01:18.202
I think...

1172
02:01:28.109 --> 02:01:29.066
Not for us?

1173
02:01:30.398 --> 02:01:32.105
No, Captain. Not for us.

1174
02:01:33.478 --> 02:01:34.477
For V'Ger.

1175
02:01:37.807 --> 02:01:40.388
I weep for V'Ger as I would for a brother.

1176
02:01:43.176 --> 02:01:44.967
As I was when I came aboard,

1177
02:01:46.673 --> 02:01:48.255
so is V'Ger now.

1178
02:01:49.170 --> 02:01:52.002
Empty, incomplete and searching.

1179
02:01:52.917 --> 02:01:56.913
Logic and knowledge are not enough.

1180
02:01:56.997 --> 02:02:00.410
Spock, are you saying
that you found what you needed,

1181
02:02:01.325 --> 02:02:02.491
but V'Ger hasn't?

1182
02:02:02.573 --> 02:02:05.405
What would V'Ger need to fulfill itself?

1183
02:02:06.237 --> 02:02:09.525
Each of us, at some time in our lives,

1184
02:02:09.608 --> 02:02:11.357
turns to someone--

1185
02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:14.187
A father, a brother, a god--

1186
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:15.395
And asks,

1187
02:02:16.726 --> 02:02:18.516
"Why am I here?

1188
02:02:18.599 --> 02:02:20.514
What was I meant to be?"

1189
02:02:22.304 --> 02:02:26.800
V'Ger hopes to touch its Creator
to find its answers.

1190
02:02:29.879 --> 02:02:33.126
"ls this all that I am?
ls there nothing more?"

1191
02:02:35.208 --> 02:02:36.290
Captain.

1192
02:02:46.862 --> 02:02:49.568
Captain,
I believe that is our destination.

1193
02:02:52.606 --> 02:02:54.812
Forward motion, slowing, Captain.

1194
02:02:57.976 --> 02:03:01.556
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

1195
02:03:10.547 --> 02:03:12.420
Forward motion, stopped, Captain.

1196
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:18.621
V'Ger.

1197
02:03:18.704 --> 02:03:22.617
Sir, I've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

1198
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:24.074
It's directly ahead.

1199
02:03:24.157 --> 02:03:28.445
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its Creator.

1200
02:03:31.983 --> 02:03:37.852
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger
with the required information.

1201
02:03:44.179 --> 02:03:46.718
Mr. Spock? Bones?

1202
02:03:50.029 --> 02:03:51.403
Mr. Decker.

1203
02:03:52.361 --> 02:03:53.984
I will contact you every five minutes.

1204
02:03:54.067 --> 02:03:55.691
Captain...

1205
02:03:57.896 --> 02:03:59.354
I'd like to go along.

1206
02:04:03.142 --> 02:04:05.140
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

1207
02:05:59.482 --> 02:06:01.230
V'Ger.

1208
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:16.862
"V-G-E-R."

1209
02:07:19.485 --> 02:07:20.816
V'Ger.

1210
02:07:34.511 --> 02:07:37.758
"V-O-Y-A-G-E-R."

1211
02:07:37.841 --> 02:07:38.840
Voyager!

1212
02:07:43.294 --> 02:07:44.959
<i>Voyager VI.</i>

1213
02:07:45.043 --> 02:07:46.042
NASA.

1214
02:07:47.082 --> 02:07:49.871
National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

1215
02:07:49.954 --> 02:07:54.283
Jim, this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

1216
02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:59.611
Voyager series.

1217
02:08:01.817 --> 02:08:03.232
Designed to collect data...

1218
02:08:06.104 --> 02:08:07.936
and transmit it back to Earth.

1219
02:08:50.143 --> 02:08:52.100
Captain.

1220
02:08:52.183 --> 02:08:56.970
Voyager VI disappeared
into what they used to call a black hole.

1221
02:08:57.053 --> 02:09:00.008
It must have emerged
on the far side of the galaxy

1222
02:09:01.174 --> 02:09:04.420
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

1223
02:09:04.504 --> 02:09:07.750
The machine inhabitants
found it to be one of their own kind.

1224
02:09:07.834 --> 02:09:09.873
Primitive, yet kindred.

1225
02:09:10.623 --> 02:09:13.411
They discovered
its simple 20th-century programming.

1226
02:09:14.036 --> 02:09:16.158
"Collect all data possible."

1227
02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.280
"Learn all that is learnable."

1228
02:09:21.153 --> 02:09:24.068
Return that information to its Creator.

1229
02:09:24.150 --> 02:09:25.316
Precisely, Mr. Decker.

1230
02:09:26.232 --> 02:09:28.729
The machines interpreted it literally.

1231
02:09:28.813 --> 02:09:30.436
They built this entire vessel

1232
02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:33.350
so that Voyager
could actually fulfill its programming.

1233
02:09:34.432 --> 02:09:36.055
And on its journey back...

1234
02:09:38.511 --> 02:09:40.717
it amassed so much knowledge...

1235
02:09:42.466 --> 02:09:45.004
it achieved consciousness itself.

1236
02:09:46.628 --> 02:09:48.293
It became a living thing.

1237
02:10:02.862 --> 02:10:03.985
Kirk unit.

1238
02:10:04.735 --> 02:10:06.733
V'Ger awaits the information.

1239
02:10:08.564 --> 02:10:09.813
<i>Enterprise,</i>

1240
02:10:10.895 --> 02:10:13.268
order up
the ship's computer library records

1241
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:16.805
on the late 20th-century NASA probe,
Voyager VI.

1242
02:10:16.889 --> 02:10:19.595
<i>Specifically,
we want the old NASA code signal</i>

1243
02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.884
<i>that instructs the probe
to transmit its data.</i>

1244
02:10:21.967 --> 02:10:24.256
-And fast, Uhura, fast.
-A ye, sir.

1245
02:10:24.339 --> 02:10:28.586
That's what it's been signaling--
its readiness to transmit its information.

1246
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:30.292
And there's no one on Earth

1247
02:10:30.375 --> 02:10:32.956
who could recognize the old signal
and send a response.

1248
02:10:33.039 --> 02:10:35.203
"The Creator does not answer."

1249
02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:46.942
V'Ger.

1250
02:10:53.185 --> 02:10:54.351
V'Ger.

1251
02:10:56.598 --> 02:10:57.931
V'Ger!

1252
02:11:02.551 --> 02:11:05.340
We are the Creator.

1253
02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.463
That is not logical.

1254
02:11:07.546 --> 02:11:10.626
-Carbon units are not true life-forms.
-We will prove it.

1255
02:11:10.710 --> 02:11:13.832
We will make it possible
for you to complete your programming.

1256
02:11:14.996 --> 02:11:17.412
Only the Creator could accomplish that.

1257
02:11:19.575 --> 02:11:20.825
<i>Enterprise.</i>

1258
02:11:20.908 --> 02:11:23.863
We have just received
the response code, Captain.

1259
02:11:23.946 --> 02:11:26.485
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency

1260
02:11:26.568 --> 02:11:29.024
and transmit the code now.

1261
02:11:29.108 --> 02:11:30.148
<i>Transmitting.</i>

1262
02:11:31.356 --> 02:11:32.646
"5-0-4,

1263
02:11:33.603 --> 02:11:35.685
3-2-9,

1264
02:11:36.267 --> 02:11:37.683
3-1-7,

1265
02:11:38.182 --> 02:11:40.180
5-1-0,"

1266
02:11:41.054 --> 02:11:42.927
and the final sequence...

1267
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:45.424
That should trigger Voyager's transmitter.

1268
02:11:58.536 --> 02:12:01.159
Voyager is not transmitting its data,
Captain.

1269
02:12:03.281 --> 02:12:05.529
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

1270
02:12:08.318 --> 02:12:10.982
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.

1271
02:12:15.519 --> 02:12:18.183
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

1272
02:12:39.662 --> 02:12:41.785
Voyager is not transmitting, Captain,

1273
02:12:41.868 --> 02:12:44.740
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

1274
02:12:44.824 --> 02:12:47.113
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.

1275
02:12:47.695 --> 02:12:49.277
<i>Enterprise,</i> stand by.

1276
02:12:57.976 --> 02:13:01.182
-The antenna leads are melted away.
-Yes, Captain, just now.

1277
02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:04.012
By V'Ger itself.

1278
02:13:04.096 --> 02:13:05.552
Why?

1279
02:13:05.636 --> 02:13:07.467
To prevent reception.

1280
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:08.841
Of course.

1281
02:13:08.924 --> 02:13:10.756
To bring the Creator here.

1282
02:13:11.713 --> 02:13:14.335
To finish transmitting the code in person.

1283
02:13:18.331 --> 02:13:19.705
To touch the Creator.

1284
02:13:22.119 --> 02:13:23.701
Capture God?

1285
02:13:24.742 --> 02:13:27.114
V'Ger's liable to be in for
one hell of a disappointment.

1286
02:13:27.198 --> 02:13:29.361
Perhaps not, Doctor.

1287
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:53.837
Captain.

1288
02:14:00.913 --> 02:14:02.661
V'Ger must evolve.

1289
02:14:02.745 --> 02:14:04.909
Its knowledge has reached
the limits of this universe,

1290
02:14:04.993 --> 02:14:06.782
and it must evolve.

1291
02:14:06.866 --> 02:14:10.070
What it requires of its god, Doctor,
is the answer to its question,

1292
02:14:10.154 --> 02:14:11.527
"ls there nothing more?"

1293
02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:14.400
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

1294
02:14:14.483 --> 02:14:16.481
Other dimensions, higher levels of being.

1295
02:14:16.564 --> 02:14:19.228
The existence of which
cannot be proven logically.

1296
02:14:19.311 --> 02:14:22.350
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

1297
02:14:22.434 --> 02:14:26.470
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve
is a human quality.

1298
02:14:27.469 --> 02:14:29.426
Our capacity to leap beyond logic.

1299
02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:36.544
And joining with its Creator
might accomplish that.

1300
02:14:36.627 --> 02:14:39.499
You mean, this machine wants
to physically join with a human?

1301
02:14:40.415 --> 02:14:42.163
Is that possible?

1302
02:14:45.743 --> 02:14:46.950
Let's find out.

1303
02:14:55.358 --> 02:14:56.691
Decker!

1304
02:14:56.773 --> 02:14:59.853
I'm going to key the final sequence
through the ground test computer.

1305
02:14:59.937 --> 02:15:01.893
Decker, you don't know
what that'll do to you!

1306
02:15:02.601 --> 02:15:04.474
Yes, I do, Doctor.

1307
02:15:10.842 --> 02:15:11.967
Decker, don't!

1308
02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:14.547
Jim, I want this.

1309
02:15:15.130 --> 02:15:19.334
As much as you wanted the Enterprise,
I want this.

1310
02:18:12.118 --> 02:18:13.159
Captain.

1311
02:18:16.198 --> 02:18:17.280
Spock,

1312
02:18:18.571 --> 02:18:20.818
did we just see
the beginning of a new life-form?

1313
02:18:20.902 --> 02:18:23.940
Yes, Captain. We witnessed a birth.

1314
02:18:24.024 --> 02:18:26.771
Possibly, a next step in our evolution.

1315
02:18:26.854 --> 02:18:28.478
I wonder.

1316
02:18:28.561 --> 02:18:31.391
Well, it's been a long time
since I delivered a baby,

1317
02:18:31.475 --> 02:18:33.597
and I hope we got this one off
to a good start.

1318
02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:35.095
I hope so too.

1319
02:18:36.428 --> 02:18:40.340
I think we gave it the ability
to create its own sense of purpose...

1320
02:18:41.922 --> 02:18:43.962
out of our own human weaknesses...

1321
02:18:45.710 --> 02:18:48.207
and the drive that compels us
to overcome them.

1322
02:18:48.291 --> 02:18:52.203
And a lot of foolish human emotions,
right, Mr. Spock?

1323
02:18:52.287 --> 02:18:53.910
Quite true, Doctor.

1324
02:18:53.993 --> 02:18:57.823
Unfortunately,
it will have to deal with them as well.

1325
02:18:57.906 --> 02:18:59.696
Interrogative from Starfleet.

1326
02:18:59.779 --> 02:19:01.736
They're requesting
damage and injury reports

1327
02:19:01.819 --> 02:19:03.317
and complete vessel status.

1328
02:19:03.401 --> 02:19:05.190
Report two casualties.

1329
02:19:05.815 --> 02:19:07.021
Lieutenant Ilia.

1330
02:19:08.854 --> 02:19:10.352
Captain Decker.

1331
02:19:10.435 --> 02:19:11.809
-Aye, sir.
-Correction.

1332
02:19:12.474 --> 02:19:13.765
They're not casualties.

1333
02:19:13.849 --> 02:19:14.930
They are...

1334
02:19:18.468 --> 02:19:20.050
List them as missing.

1335
02:19:21.007 --> 02:19:23.089
Vessel status, fully operational.

1336
02:19:23.172 --> 02:19:24.379
Aye, sir.

1337
02:19:25.295 --> 02:19:27.252
Mr. Scott.

1338
02:19:27.334 --> 02:19:30.415
Shall we give the Enterprise
a proper shakedown?

1339
02:19:30.498 --> 02:19:33.328
I would say it's time for that, sir. Aye.

1340
02:19:33.412 --> 02:19:36.243
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr. Spock.

1341
02:19:36.325 --> 02:19:38.781
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.

1342
02:19:38.864 --> 02:19:41.278
My task on Vulcan is completed.

1343
02:19:42.653 --> 02:19:45.109
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1.

1344
02:19:45.192 --> 02:19:46.315
Warp 1, sir.

1345
02:19:46.399 --> 02:19:47.730
Heading, sir?

1346
02:19:51.726 --> 02:19:52.975
Out there.

1347
02:19:55.306 --> 02:19:56.472
Thataway.
