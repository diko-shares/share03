1
00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:48.513
Tactical.

2
00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.992
Visual.

3
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.832
Tactical, stand by on torpedoes.

4
00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:25.050
Ready...

5
00:06:28.178 --> 00:06:29.262
Fire!

6
00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:56.331
Evasive!

7
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:08.381
This is comm station
Epsilon IX calling USS Columbia.

8
00:07:08.677 --> 00:07:11.346
Come in, Columbia. Respond, please.

9
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.889
This is Scout Columbia...

10
00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:17.473
Epsilon IX,
this is dreadnought Entente NCC-2120...

11
00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:19.854
This is Epsilon IX, Columbia.

12
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.316
Am boosting output. How read you this?

13
00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:26.027
Fine, fine, Epsilon IX.
Proceed with your transmission.

14
00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:29.614
Scout Columbia NCC-621,

15
00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:34.198
to rendezvous with Scout Revere NCC-595

16
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:38.415
on Stardate 7411.4.

17
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:40.709
Further orders will be relayed
at that time.

18
00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:43.462
Signed, Commodore Probert, Starfleet.

19
00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:44.963
End of transmission.

20
00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:47.758
Received and understood,
Epsilon IX. Thank you.

21
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:49.592
USS Columbia out.

22
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.683
Our sensor drone
is intercepting this on Quad L-14.

23
00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.853
That's within
Klingon boundaries. Who are they fighting?

24
00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:01.980
Unknown, sir.

25
00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.025
I have an exterior visual.

26
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.310
We've plotted a course on that cloud,
Commander.

27
00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:25.105
It will pass into Federation space
fairly close to us.

28
00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:27.190
Heading?

29
00:09:27.983 --> 00:09:30.568
Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth.

30
00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:31.637
Our ancestors cast out their animal
passions on these very sands...

31
00:10:33.164 --> 00:10:39.189
...saving our race through
the attainment of kolinahr.

32
00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:43.659
Through which all emotion
is renounced and shed.

33
00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:46.144
You have labored
for many seasons, Spock...

34
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.938
and you have proved
yourself worthy...

35
00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:52.400
to receive from us
this symbol of pure logic.

36
00:11:18.343 --> 00:11:21.304
Your thoughts... Give them to me.

37
00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.396
Our minds are joined, Spock...

38
00:11:30.063 --> 00:11:33.066
Together, and as one.

39
00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:48.790
I sense the consciousness
calling to you from space...

40
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:52.627
Your human blood is
touched by it, Spock.

41
00:12:01.261 --> 00:12:04.430
You have not yet attained Kolinahr.

42
00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:09.686
He must search elsewhere
for his answer.

43
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:13.815
He shall not find it here.

44
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:19.988
Live long and prosper, spock.

45
00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:20.716
Commander Sonak.

46
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:24.378
You received your appointment
as Enterprise science officer?

47
00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:26.405
Based, I am told,
on your recommendation, Admiral.

48
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.949
- Thank you.
- Then why aren't you aboard?

49
00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:30.368
Captain Decker requested
I complete final science briefing here

50
00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:33.228
- before we leave on our mission.
- Here? At Starfleet?

51
00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:37.440
The Enterprise
is in final preparation to leave dock.

52
00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:39.585
Which will require 20 more hours
at minimum, Admiral.

53
00:13:39.609 --> 00:13:40.735
Twelve.

54
00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:43.363
I'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura

55
00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:45.532
which will not last
more than three minutes.

56
00:13:45.615 --> 00:13:47.658
Report to me on the Enterprise
in one hour.

57
00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:48.785
Report to you, sir?

58
00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:53.369
It is my intention to be on that ship
following that meeting.

59
00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:55.166
Report to me in one hour.

60
00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:07.947
- Admiral.
- Mr. Scott.

61
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.284
Those departure orders. Twelve hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.

62
00:15:11.368 --> 00:15:13.787
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters
operating, Mr. Scott?

63
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.663
A wee problem, sir. Just temporary.

64
00:15:15.747 --> 00:15:20.168
Admiral, we have just finished 18 months
redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.

65
00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:23.022
How in the name of hell do they expect me
to have her ready in 12 hours?

66
00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:24.172
Take me over, please.

67
00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:30.845
She needs more work, sir. A shakedown.

68
00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:31.930
Mr. Scott.

69
00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.684
An alien object
of unbelievable destructive power

70
00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:37.769
is less than three days away
from this planet.

71
00:15:38.478 --> 00:15:41.898
The only starship in interception range
is the Enterprise.

72
00:15:42.482 --> 00:15:44.901
Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours.

73
00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:09.384
The crew haven't had
near enough transition time

74
00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.927
with all the new equipment.

75
00:16:12.262 --> 00:16:15.181
And the engines,
they're not even tested at warp power.

76
00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.685
And an untried captain.

77
00:16:18.768 --> 00:16:21.061
Two and a half years
as chief of Starfleet operations

78
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.564
may have made me a little stale,

79
00:16:22.647 --> 00:16:25.983
but I wouldn't exactly
consider myself untried.

80
00:16:30.405 --> 00:16:32.073
They gave her back to me, Scotty.

81
00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.867
Gave her back, sir?

82
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.410
Well, I doubt
it was that easy with Nogura.

83
00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:38.579
You're right.

84
00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:45.337
Well, any man
who could manage such a feat,

85
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.296
I would not dare to disappoint.

86
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:49.965
She'll launch on time, sir.

87
00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:51.843
And she'll be ready.

88
00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:41.924
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
- Aye, sir.

89
00:21:43.968 --> 00:21:45.761
Cargo bay to launch crew.

90
00:21:45.845 --> 00:21:48.764
A travel pod is now available at dock 6.

91
00:21:51.392 --> 00:21:53.352
- Permission to come aboard, sir.
- Granted, sir.

92
00:21:53.436 --> 00:21:55.020
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

93
00:21:55.104 --> 00:21:57.385
Commander Scott,
you're needed in Engineering immediately.

94
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.899
Sir, you'll excuse me?

95
00:22:01.903 --> 00:22:03.237
Flight deck,

96
00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:06.032
prepare for an incoming shuttlecraft.

97
00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:10.817
- Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll show you...
- I think I can find my way, Ensign.

98
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:12.372
Aye, sir.

99
00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:18.628
Bridge.

100
00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:25.385
What's the problem?

101
00:22:25.468 --> 00:22:27.868
I thought you people
had that circuit patched in an hour ago!

102
00:22:27.929 --> 00:22:29.597
We did. We had to disconnect it again

103
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.183
- so we could tie in radio messaging.
- All right. Take out...

104
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:39.940
All right,
as soon as somebody can get to it.

105
00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:43.820
What's the next program?

106
00:22:43.903 --> 00:22:46.196
I'll get somebody down there
as soon as I can, Cleary.

107
00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:47.949
My people are all tied up now.

108
00:22:51.744 --> 00:22:55.748
Captain, Starfleet just signaled
your transfer-of-command order, sir.

109
00:22:58.167 --> 00:22:59.918
- Captain.
- I appreciate the welcome.

110
00:23:01.212 --> 00:23:03.339
I wish the circumstances
were less critical.

111
00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:06.342
Epsilon IX is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

112
00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:07.468
Aye, sir.

113
00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:09.929
Where's Captain Decker?

114
00:23:10.513 --> 00:23:12.515
He's in Engineering, sir.

115
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.600
He...

116
00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:15.393
He doesn't know.

117
00:23:18.104 --> 00:23:19.772
- Mr. Chekov.
- Aye, sir.

118
00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:22.775
Assemble the crew
on the recreation deck at 0400 hours.

119
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.570
I want to show them what we're facing.

120
00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:32.409
He wanted her back. He got her.

121
00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:34.703
And Captain Decker?

122
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:37.573
He's been with this ship
every minute of her refitting.

123
00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:42.124
Ensign, the possibilities of our returning
from this mission in one piece

124
00:23:42.253 --> 00:23:43.420
may have just doubled.

125
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.966
Engineering,

126
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.094
show me your readings
on photon capacitors.

127
00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:56.892
Check Cleary on number six.

128
00:23:56.976 --> 00:24:00.771
All WD stations, maintain present status.

129
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:11.282
Main stage flux chillers
port and starboard.

130
00:24:12.116 --> 00:24:13.534
Inter-cooler status.

131
00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:16.954
Space matrix restoration coils.

132
00:24:17.747 --> 00:24:19.457
Dilithium crystals.

133
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.501
I knew it.
The transporter sensor was not activated.

134
00:24:22.585 --> 00:24:24.628
Air equalization automatic off.

135
00:24:24.712 --> 00:24:25.921
A faulty module.

136
00:24:26.005 --> 00:24:28.424
Cleary!
Put a new backup sensor into the unit.

137
00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:29.509
Aye, sir.

138
00:24:30.718 --> 00:24:32.886
Emergency shutdown trips.

139
00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.180
Admiral Kirk!

140
00:24:34.263 --> 00:24:36.556
Well, we're getting a top-brass send-off.
Don't worry.

141
00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.184
She'll launch on schedule,

142
00:24:38.267 --> 00:24:40.852
if we have to tow her out
with our bare hands. Right, Scotty?

143
00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:43.898
Aye... that we will, sir.

144
00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:47.151
- Let's talk.
- Sure.

145
00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:49.654
- Let me know when that backup's ready.
- Aye, sir.

146
00:24:49.737 --> 00:24:53.031
All due respect, sir, I hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

147
00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:55.993
- I'm really too busy.
- I'm taking over the center seat, Will.

148
00:24:56.953 --> 00:24:57.995
You're what?

149
00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:00.706
I'm replacing you
as captain of the Enterprise.

150
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:05.290
You'll stay on as executive officer,
temporary grade reduction to commander.

151
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.258
You, personally, are assuming command?

152
00:25:11.342 --> 00:25:12.343
Yeah.

153
00:25:12.927 --> 00:25:14.637
May I ask why?

154
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:16.097
My experience.

155
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.017
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

156
00:25:21.602 --> 00:25:23.687
My familiarity with the Enterprise,
its crew.

157
00:25:23.771 --> 00:25:26.982
Admiral, this is an almost
totally new Enterprise.

158
00:25:27.066 --> 00:25:29.109
You don't know her
a tenth as well as I do.

159
00:25:29.193 --> 00:25:30.513
That's why you're staying aboard.

160
00:25:37.201 --> 00:25:38.368
I'm sorry, Will.

161
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.872
No, Admiral. I don't think you're sorry.

162
00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:43.999
Not one damn bit.

163
00:25:45.918 --> 00:25:48.503
I remember when you recommended me
for this command.

164
00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:50.923
You told me how envious you were
and how much you hoped

165
00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:53.009
you'd find a way
to get a starship command again.

166
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.721
Well, sir,

167
00:25:58.347 --> 00:26:00.223
it looks like you found a way.

168
00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:07.189
Report to the bridge, Commander,
immediately.

169
00:26:09.942 --> 00:26:10.943
Aye, sir.

170
00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:25.541
Transporter room, come in! Urgent!

171
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:27.460
Red line on the transporter, Mr. Scott.

172
00:26:27.543 --> 00:26:29.753
Transporter, do not engage.

173
00:26:29.837 --> 00:26:31.922
- It's too late. They're beaming now.
- Do not...

174
00:26:33.382 --> 00:26:37.882
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override us. Pull them back.

175
00:26:38.012 --> 00:26:41.015
Unable to retrieve
their pattern, Enterprise.

176
00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:50.065
Give it to me.

177
00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:56.989
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

178
00:27:02.578 --> 00:27:03.870
More signal!

179
00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.331
We're losing their pattern.

180
00:27:05.414 --> 00:27:07.541
Oh, no. They're forming.

181
00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:33.275
Starfleet, do you have them?

182
00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:38.906
Enterprise,
what we got back didn't live long.

183
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.032
Fortunately.

184
00:27:44.745 --> 00:27:46.455
Starfleet, Kirk.

185
00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:51.710
Please express my condolences
to their families.

186
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.841
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan Embassy.

187
00:28:03.264 --> 00:28:05.224
There was nothing
you could have done, Rand.

188
00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:07.434
It wasn't your fault.

189
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.253
Yeoman. Turboshaft 8?

190
00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:35.588
Back that way, sir.

191
00:28:43.179 --> 00:28:45.306
We have to replace Commander Sonak.

192
00:28:47.642 --> 00:28:50.144
I'd still like a Vulcan there,
if possible.

193
00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.687
None available, Captain.

194
00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:54.648
In fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

195
00:28:55.191 --> 00:28:56.817
You are, Mr. Decker.

196
00:28:57.526 --> 00:28:59.819
I'm afraid you're gonna have to double
as science officer.

197
00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:34.063
That's all we know about it.

198
00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:39.944
Except that it is now 53.4 hours
away from Earth.

199
00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:47.243
Enterprise is the only Federation starship
that stands in its way.

200
00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:50.830
Our orders are to intercept,

201
00:29:50.913 --> 00:29:52.205
investigate

202
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.544
and take whatever action is necessary...
and possible.

203
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.218
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon IX.

204
00:30:04.844 --> 00:30:06.679
- Put it on viewer.
- On viewer, sir.

205
00:30:06.762 --> 00:30:11.262
Enterprise. The cloud is definitely
a power field of some kind.

206
00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.560
Measures...

207
00:30:13.644 --> 00:30:17.064
My God. Over two AUs in diameter.

208
00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:20.359
Must be something incredible
inside there generating it.

209
00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:25.322
We're transmitting linguacode
friendship messages on all frequencies.

210
00:30:25.406 --> 00:30:26.407
No response.

211
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.575
I have a null reading
at the center of the cloud.

212
00:30:28.659 --> 00:30:30.285
Definitely something inside there,

213
00:30:30.369 --> 00:30:33.789
- but all scans are being reflected back.
- Some kind of power surge.

214
00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:35.749
Receiving an odd pattern now.

215
00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:39.044
Enterprise, they could be
mistaking our scans as a hostile act.

216
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:41.046
They seem to be reacting
to our scans, sir.

217
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.923
Deflectors, emergency full!

218
00:30:45.259 --> 00:30:46.885
We are under attack.

219
00:30:46.969 --> 00:30:48.220
External view.

220
00:31:46.695 --> 00:31:47.696
Viewer off.

221
00:31:59.834 --> 00:32:02.169
Pre-launch countdown will commence
in 40 minutes.

222
00:32:19.562 --> 00:32:23.315
Transporter system fully repaired
and functioning normally, sir.

223
00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:24.858
Dock signals clear, Captain.

224
00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:27.903
Reply we are holding position,
awaiting final crew replacements.

225
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:28.988
Aye, sir.

226
00:32:29.905 --> 00:32:34.405
Transporter personnel reports
the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia,

227
00:32:35.161 --> 00:32:37.830
she's already aboard
and en route to the bridge, sir.

228
00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:41.333
She's Deltan, Captain.

229
00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:48.466
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.

230
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:49.925
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

231
00:32:52.094 --> 00:32:53.095
Hello, Ilia.

232
00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:54.513
Decker.

233
00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:58.017
I was stationed on the lieutenant's
home planet some years ago.

234
00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.810
Commander Decker?

235
00:33:01.353 --> 00:33:03.104
Yes, our exec and science officer.

236
00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:05.858
Captain Kirk
has the utmost confidence in me.

237
00:33:07.776 --> 00:33:09.152
And in you too, Lieutenant.

238
00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:12.739
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.

239
00:33:12.823 --> 00:33:14.825
- May I assume my duties?
- By all means.

240
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:17.953
Captain?

241
00:33:18.037 --> 00:33:20.998
Starfleet reports our last six
crew members are ready to beam up,

242
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:24.751
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

243
00:33:24.835 --> 00:33:26.086
Oh?

244
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.796
I'll see to it that he beams up.

245
00:33:28.964 --> 00:33:29.965
Transporter room.

246
00:33:34.887 --> 00:33:36.346
- Yeoman.
- Yes, sir?

247
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.722
What was the problem down there?

248
00:33:37.806 --> 00:33:39.516
He insisted we go first, sir.

249
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.186
Said something about first seeing
how it scrambled our molecules.

250
00:33:45.648 --> 00:33:47.524
That has a familiar ring, doesn't it?

251
00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:50.569
Starfleet, this is Captain Kirk.

252
00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:53.197
Beam that officer up now.

253
00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:17.346
Well, for a man who swore
he'd never return to Starfleet...

254
00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.639
Just a moment, Captain, sir.

255
00:34:20.307 --> 00:34:22.392
I'll explain what happened.

256
00:34:22.476 --> 00:34:25.770
Your revered Admiral Nogura
invoked a little-known,

257
00:34:25.854 --> 00:34:29.357
seldom-used reserve activation clause.

258
00:34:29.441 --> 00:34:32.444
In simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me.

259
00:34:32.528 --> 00:34:33.529
They didn't.

260
00:34:35.906 --> 00:34:36.948
This was your idea.

261
00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:39.284
This was your idea, wasn't it?

262
00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:40.952
Bones, there's a thing out there.

263
00:34:41.036 --> 00:34:44.080
Why is any object we don't understand
always called a "thing"?

264
00:34:44.164 --> 00:34:45.373
Headed this way.

265
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.501
I need you.

266
00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:52.589
Damn it, Bones. I need you.

267
00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:55.259
Badly.

268
00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.481
Permission to come aboard?

269
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.401
Permission granted, sir.

270
00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:18.031
Well, Jim.

271
00:35:19.074 --> 00:35:21.034
I hear Chapel's an MD now.

272
00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:23.954
Well, I'm going to need a top nurse,

273
00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:27.499
not a doctor who'll argue
every little diagnosis with me.

274
00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:31.962
And they probably redesigned
the whole sickbay too.

275
00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:34.631
I know engineers.
They love to change things.

276
00:35:55.903 --> 00:35:57.905
Dock control reports ready, sir.

277
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:00.323
Helm ready, sir.

278
00:36:00.407 --> 00:36:02.158
Orbital departure on plot, sir.

279
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:05.036
Yard command signaling clear, sir.

280
00:36:05.621 --> 00:36:07.247
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

281
00:36:08.207 --> 00:36:10.083
- Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
- Hold station.

282
00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:13.128
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

283
00:36:33.899 --> 00:36:35.275
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.

284
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.281
Take us out.

285
00:38:05.073 --> 00:38:08.826
Intermix set, bridge.
Impulse power at your discretion.

286
00:38:09.411 --> 00:38:10.829
Impulse power, Mr. Sulu.

287
00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.208
Ahead warp .5.

288
00:38:29.097 --> 00:38:30.598
Departure angle on viewer.

289
00:38:30.682 --> 00:38:31.974
Departure angle.

290
00:38:37.397 --> 00:38:38.606
Viewer ahead.

291
00:38:39.525 --> 00:38:40.609
Viewer ahead.

292
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.052
Captain's Log, Stardate 7412.6.

293
00:39:07.135 --> 00:39:09.137
1.8 hours from launch.

294
00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:13.183
In order to intercept the intruder
at the earliest possible time,

295
00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:17.938
we must now risk engaging warp drive
while still within the solar system.

296
00:39:18.021 --> 00:39:21.607
Captain, assuming
we have full warp capability,

297
00:39:22.442 --> 00:39:25.361
accelerating to warp 7
on leaving the solar system

298
00:39:25.445 --> 00:39:29.824
will bring us to IP with the intruder
in 20.1 hours.

299
00:39:34.288 --> 00:39:37.457
Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities
meet with your approval?

300
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.750
They do not.

301
00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.961
It's like working
in a damned computer center.

302
00:39:41.044 --> 00:39:42.045
Programming ready?

303
00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:44.131
Program set
for standard warp entry, Captain.

304
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.509
But I still recommend
further simulation study.

305
00:39:48.093 --> 00:39:52.593
Mr. Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

306
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.143
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.

307
00:39:56.226 --> 00:39:59.395
Captain, we need further
warp simulation on the flow sensors.

308
00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:02.023
Engineer, we need warp speed now.

309
00:40:02.107 --> 00:40:03.108
Jim?

310
00:40:04.484 --> 00:40:05.776
You're pushing.

311
00:40:07.988 --> 00:40:09.656
Your people know their jobs.

312
00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:13.618
That's it, sir. I can't do any better.

313
00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:16.580
Aye, lad.

314
00:40:19.791 --> 00:40:23.211
It's borderline on the simulator, Captain.
I cannot guarantee that she'll hold up.

315
00:40:23.795 --> 00:40:25.046
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.

316
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.589
Ahead, warp 1, Mr. Sulu.

317
00:40:26.673 --> 00:40:28.675
Accelerating to warp 1, sir.

318
00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:33.305
Warp .7.

319
00:40:34.681 --> 00:40:36.265
8.

320
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:48.612
Warp 1, sir.

321
00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:51.740
Mr. Decker...

322
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:55.702
Wormhole.

323
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.997
Get us back on impulse power.
Full reverse.

324
00:41:05.087 --> 00:41:06.963
It's a redline. It needs backup!

325
00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.179
Negative helm control, Captain.

326
00:41:14.262 --> 00:41:16.264
Going reverse on impulse power.

327
00:41:16.348 --> 00:41:19.726
Subspace frequencies jammed, sir.
Wormhole effect.

328
00:41:31.279 --> 00:41:33.155
Negative control from inertial lag

329
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.660
will continue 22.5 seconds before
forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.

330
00:41:36.743 --> 00:41:38.411
Unidentified small object

331
00:41:38.495 --> 00:41:41.372
has been pulled into the wormhole with us,
Captain, directly ahead.

332
00:41:41.456 --> 00:41:42.540
Force fields up full.

333
00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:44.959
Put object on viewer.

334
00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.508
Go manual override on helm.

335
00:41:52.175 --> 00:41:53.384
No manual response, sir.

336
00:41:53.468 --> 00:41:55.428
Navigational deflectors coming up, sir.

337
00:41:56.054 --> 00:41:58.241
Wormhole distortion has overloaded
the main power systems.

338
00:41:58.265 --> 00:42:00.725
Navigational deflectors
inoperative, Captain.

339
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.312
Directional control also inoperative.

340
00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:13.363
Time to impact?

341
00:42:13.447 --> 00:42:16.199
Twenty seconds.

342
00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:19.619
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.

343
00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:21.997
No!

344
00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:29.003
Belay that phaser order.

345
00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:41.850
Arm photon torpedoes!

346
00:42:48.648 --> 00:42:52.485
Photon torpedoes...

347
00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.325
armed!

348
00:43:05.123 --> 00:43:08.334
Object is an asteroid,

349
00:43:08.418 --> 00:43:10.837
reading mass .7.

350
00:43:14.049 --> 00:43:18.549
Targeting asteroid.

351
00:43:20.847 --> 00:43:24.141
Impact in ten seconds.

352
00:43:30.649 --> 00:43:33.568
Impact in eight seconds.

353
00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:35.570
Fire torpedoes!

354
00:43:35.748 --> 00:43:36.748
Six...

355
00:43:36.773 --> 00:43:40.276
Torpedoes away!

356
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.784
Four!

357
00:44:08.019 --> 00:44:09.770
Helm control restored, sir.

358
00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.484
Position report, Navigator.

359
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:16.778
Computing new intersection course.

360
00:44:16.862 --> 00:44:18.864
Communications are normal, sir.

361
00:44:18.947 --> 00:44:20.782
Negative damage reported, Captain.

362
00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:22.951
No casualties reported, Doctor.

363
00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:26.329
Wrong, Mr. Chekov. There are casualties.

364
00:44:26.413 --> 00:44:27.497
My wits!

365
00:44:28.582 --> 00:44:31.543
As in "frightened out of," Captain, sir.

366
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:33.669
We're at warp .8.

367
00:44:34.504 --> 00:44:36.255
Engineer, report your status there.

368
00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:40.510
In just a second, Exec.
We're picking up the pieces down here.

369
00:44:42.929 --> 00:44:44.972
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

370
00:44:45.056 --> 00:44:47.266
Captain, it was the engine imbalance

371
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.727
that created the wormhole
in the first place.

372
00:44:49.811 --> 00:44:51.729
It will happen again
if we don't correct it.

373
00:44:51.813 --> 00:44:53.898
That object is less than two days
away from Earth.

374
00:44:53.982 --> 00:44:56.025
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

375
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.364
Navigator, lay in a new heading to conform
with our initial IP with the intruder.

376
00:45:02.365 --> 00:45:04.033
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

377
00:45:04.117 --> 00:45:07.495
Mr. Decker,
I'd like to see you in my quarters.

378
00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:09.497
Mind if I tag along, Captain?

379
00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:14.711
Level five.

380
00:45:25.305 --> 00:45:28.308
All right, explanation.
Why was my phaser order countermanded?

381
00:45:28.391 --> 00:45:31.060
Sir, the Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power

382
00:45:31.144 --> 00:45:32.937
by channeling it through the main engines.

383
00:45:33.855 --> 00:45:38.150
When they went into antimatter imbalance,
the phasers were automatically cut off.

384
00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:44.240
Then you acted properly, of course.

385
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:46.451
Thank you, sir.

386
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.912
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

387
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.333
- You saved the ship.
- I'm aware of that, sir.

388
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.295
Stop competing with me, Decker.

389
00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.176
- Permission to speak freely, sir?
- Granted.

390
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.639
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour
in two and a half years.

391
00:46:08.473 --> 00:46:11.726
That, plus your unfamiliarity with
the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir,

392
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.812
seriously jeopardizes this mission.

393
00:46:19.859 --> 00:46:21.318
I trust you will...

394
00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:25.615
nursemaid me
through these difficulties, mister?

395
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.951
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

396
00:46:28.034 --> 00:46:30.661
Then I won't keep you from your duties
any longer, Commander.

397
00:46:31.162 --> 00:46:32.621
- Yes, Doctor?
- Aye, sir.

398
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.381
He may be right, Jim.

399
00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:51.975
Was he difficult?

400
00:46:53.518 --> 00:46:54.769
No more than I expected.

401
00:46:54.853 --> 00:46:57.397
About as difficult as seeing you again.

402
00:46:59.649 --> 00:47:00.650
I'm sorry.

403
00:47:01.234 --> 00:47:02.610
That you left Delta IV?

404
00:47:03.445 --> 00:47:05.280
Or that you didn't even say goodbye?

405
00:47:08.199 --> 00:47:09.700
If I had seen you again,

406
00:47:11.578 --> 00:47:13.496
would you have been able to say it?

407
00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.000
No.

408
00:47:30.472 --> 00:47:31.681
Make your point, Doctor.

409
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.017
The point, Captain,
is that it's you who's competing.

410
00:47:35.602 --> 00:47:38.313
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

411
00:47:38.396 --> 00:47:41.232
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

412
00:47:44.652 --> 00:47:46.779
And I intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

413
00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:47.864
Yes.

414
00:47:48.865 --> 00:47:50.074
It's an obsession.

415
00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.618
An obsession that can blind you

416
00:47:52.702 --> 00:47:56.163
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

417
00:47:56.247 --> 00:47:58.958
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

418
00:48:00.418 --> 00:48:02.586
Bridge to Captain.

419
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:03.671
Viewer on.

420
00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:08.301
Signal from a Federation-registered
long-range shuttle, sir.

421
00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:11.429
She wishes to come alongside and lock on.

422
00:48:11.513 --> 00:48:12.514
For what purpose?

423
00:48:12.597 --> 00:48:16.684
My security scan shows
it has a Grade 1 priority, Captain.

424
00:48:16.768 --> 00:48:18.853
Non-belligerency confirmed.

425
00:48:18.937 --> 00:48:22.106
I suspect it is a courier of some kind.

426
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:23.941
Very well, Mr. Chekov. See to it.

427
00:48:24.442 --> 00:48:25.693
Viewer off.

428
00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:28.738
Your opinion has been noted.

429
00:48:29.614 --> 00:48:30.656
Anything further?

430
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:33.951
That depends on you.

431
00:49:49.235 --> 00:49:51.445
Security scan. One boarder.

432
00:49:51.529 --> 00:49:53.864
Identity, Starfleet, inactive.

433
00:49:59.704 --> 00:50:01.330
Permission to come aboard, sir.

434
00:50:01.831 --> 00:50:05.543
Granted, sir. Gran... ted.

435
00:50:16.267 --> 00:50:18.394
Why... Why, it's Mr...

436
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:19.432
Spock!

437
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.812
Spock.

438
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.237
Commander, if I may.

439
00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:49.879
I've been monitoring your communications
with Starfleet Command, Captain.

440
00:50:50.713 --> 00:50:53.257
I'm aware
of your engine design difficulties.

441
00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:57.762
I offer my services as science officer.

442
00:50:59.013 --> 00:51:00.681
With all due respect, Commander.

443
00:51:01.474 --> 00:51:03.017
If our exec has no objections?

444
00:51:03.101 --> 00:51:05.770
Of course not. I'm well aware
of Mr. Spock's qualifications.

445
00:51:05.853 --> 00:51:09.565
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.

446
00:51:10.149 --> 00:51:11.984
List him as science officer,

447
00:51:12.944 --> 00:51:15.529
both effective immediately.

448
00:51:16.614 --> 00:51:17.740
Mr. Spock.

449
00:51:17.824 --> 00:51:20.910
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.

450
00:51:34.173 --> 00:51:35.841
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.

451
00:51:35.925 --> 00:51:37.927
Captain, with your permission,

452
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:40.763
I will now discuss these fuel equations
with the engineer.

453
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.311
Mr. Spock?

454
00:51:47.312 --> 00:51:48.813
Welcome aboard.

455
00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:16.340
Captain's Log, Stardate 7473.4.

456
00:52:17.216 --> 00:52:20.469
Thanks to Mr. Spock's timely arrival
and assistance,

457
00:52:21.179 --> 00:52:24.348
we have the engines re-balanced
into full warp capacity.

458
00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:27.184
Repair time, less than three hours.

459
00:52:27.268 --> 00:52:29.812
Which means we will now be able
to intercept intruder

460
00:52:29.896 --> 00:52:31.647
while still more than a day from Earth.

461
00:52:33.566 --> 00:52:35.192
Warp .8.

462
00:52:40.698 --> 00:52:41.740
.9.

463
00:52:50.083 --> 00:52:51.334
Warp 2, sir.

464
00:52:54.087 --> 00:52:55.088
Warp 3.

465
00:52:58.591 --> 00:52:59.633
Warp 4.

466
00:53:03.012 --> 00:53:04.179
Warp 5.

467
00:53:06.974 --> 00:53:07.975
Warp 6.

468
00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:16.776
Warp 7.

469
00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:36.253
Science Officer Spock,
reporting as ordered, Captain.

470
00:53:37.296 --> 00:53:38.297
Please, sit down.

471
00:53:40.425 --> 00:53:42.343
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

472
00:53:42.427 --> 00:53:45.012
You're just as warm and sociable as ever.

473
00:53:45.596 --> 00:53:46.722
Nor have you, Doctor,

474
00:53:47.515 --> 00:53:51.143
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

475
00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.394
Gentlemen.

476
00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:56.983
At last report, you were on Vulcan,

477
00:53:57.984 --> 00:53:59.151
apparently to stay.

478
00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:03.864
Yes, you were undergoing
the "Kolineer" discipline.

479
00:54:04.615 --> 00:54:05.616
Sit down.

480
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:10.037
If you are referring to the Kolinahr,
Doctor, you are correct.

481
00:54:10.788 --> 00:54:13.207
Well, however it's pronounced, Mr. Spock,

482
00:54:13.791 --> 00:54:18.291
it's the Vulcan ritual that's supposed
to purge all remaining emotions.

483
00:54:18.713 --> 00:54:20.965
The Kolinahr
is also a discipline you broke

484
00:54:21.966 --> 00:54:22.967
to join us.

485
00:54:25.344 --> 00:54:29.389
Will you please sit down?

486
00:54:40.526 --> 00:54:43.278
On Vulcan, I began sensing a consciousness

487
00:54:43.362 --> 00:54:46.615
from a source more powerful
than I have ever encountered.

488
00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:49.993
Thought patterns
of exactingly perfect order.

489
00:54:50.077 --> 00:54:52.162
I believe they emanate from the intruder.

490
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.916
I believe it may hold my answers.

491
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.920
Well, isn't it lucky for you that
we just happen to be heading your way?

492
00:55:00.713 --> 00:55:01.714
Bones.

493
00:55:04.091 --> 00:55:05.300
We need him.

494
00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:08.888
I need him.

495
00:55:10.598 --> 00:55:13.559
Then my presence is
to our mutual advantage.

496
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.983
Any thought patterns you might sense...

497
00:55:24.445 --> 00:55:26.530
whether they appear
to affect you personally or not,

498
00:55:26.614 --> 00:55:28.824
I expect immediately reported.

499
00:55:28.908 --> 00:55:30.409
Of course, Captain.

500
00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.579
Is there anything else?

501
00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:35.039
No.

502
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.051
Jim?

503
00:55:50.763 --> 00:55:55.263
If this super-intelligence
is as important to him as he says it is,

504
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:57.602
how do we know...

505
00:55:57.687 --> 00:56:00.106
That he wouldn't put his own interests
ahead of the ship's?

506
00:56:03.568 --> 00:56:05.194
I could never believe that.

507
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.280
How do we know about any of us?

508
00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.283
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

509
00:56:10.908 --> 00:56:14.369
Revised estimate on cloud visual contact,
3.7 minutes.

510
00:56:14.453 --> 00:56:15.454
On my way.

511
00:56:19.333 --> 00:56:21.626
Bypass! Alternate integrators!

512
00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:35.975
Standard light, Engineer.

513
00:56:38.144 --> 00:56:39.270
Full mag on viewer.

514
00:56:39.353 --> 00:56:40.354
Full mag, sir.

515
00:56:49.614 --> 00:56:50.615
Linguacode?

516
00:56:50.698 --> 00:56:53.283
Continuing friendship messages
on all frequencies, sir.

517
00:56:53.367 --> 00:56:55.786
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status Red.

518
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:58.038
Captain, we are being scanned.

519
00:56:58.122 --> 00:56:59.998
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.

520
00:57:01.208 --> 00:57:03.084
Could be misinterpreted as hostility.

521
00:57:03.169 --> 00:57:06.380
Intruder scans emanating
from the exact center of the cloud.

522
00:57:07.131 --> 00:57:10.884
Energy of a type never before encountered.

523
00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:21.729
There's no response
to friendship messages, sir.

524
00:57:21.812 --> 00:57:23.732
- Shall I go to battle stations, sir?
- Negative.

525
00:57:23.814 --> 00:57:25.440
We'll take no provocative action.

526
00:57:25.524 --> 00:57:28.568
Recommend defensive posture, Captain.
Screens and shields.

527
00:57:30.237 --> 00:57:31.529
No, Mr. Decker.

528
00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:34.533
That could also
be misinterpreted as hostile.

529
00:57:36.118 --> 00:57:38.370
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?

530
00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.873
- Twelfth power energy field.
- Twelfth power?

531
00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.726
Captain, we've seen
what their weapons can do.

532
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:44.353
Shouldn't we take
every possible precaution?

533
00:57:44.377 --> 00:57:45.586
- Mr. Decker...
- Captain.

534
00:57:46.587 --> 00:57:49.881
I suspect there's an object
at the heart of that cloud.

535
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:58.140
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough for you...

536
00:57:58.224 --> 00:58:02.228
Captain, as your exec,
it's my duty to point out alternatives.

537
00:58:04.438 --> 00:58:05.480
Yes, it is.

538
00:58:07.191 --> 00:58:08.442
I stand corrected.

539
00:58:08.526 --> 00:58:10.486
Five minutes to cloud boundary.

540
00:58:10.569 --> 00:58:14.781
Navigator, lay in a conic section
flight path to the cloud center.

541
00:58:14.865 --> 00:58:18.493
Bring us parallel
to whatever we find in there.

542
00:58:18.577 --> 00:58:20.161
Mr. Sulu, tactical on viewer.

543
00:58:20.246 --> 00:58:21.455
Tactical on viewer, sir.

544
00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:39.098
That measures 12th power energy?

545
00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:43.477
Thousands of starships
couldn't generate that much...

546
00:58:44.937 --> 00:58:45.938
Mr. Spock?

547
00:58:50.359 --> 00:58:51.693
Spock, tell me.

548
00:59:00.327 --> 00:59:03.747
I sense... puzzlement.

549
00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:06.876
We have been contacted.

550
00:59:09.211 --> 00:59:10.879
Why have we not replied?

551
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:12.590
Contacted?

552
00:59:13.632 --> 00:59:14.633
How?

553
00:59:17.386 --> 00:59:19.638
Force fields up full. Deflectors, now.

554
00:59:21.682 --> 00:59:23.475
Impact in 30 seconds.

555
00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.477
Force fields and deflectors up full,
Captain.

556
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.237
Analysis, Mr. Spock.

557
00:59:35.321 --> 00:59:38.324
Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy,
Captain.

558
00:59:38.407 --> 00:59:40.450
Exact composition, unknown.

559
00:59:40.534 --> 00:59:42.744
Guidance system, unknown.

560
00:59:45.247 --> 00:59:46.498
All decks brace for impact.

561
00:59:56.258 --> 00:59:57.592
Engineering, status report.

562
00:59:57.676 --> 00:59:59.386
Systems overloading, Captain.

563
01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:10.648
Medic.

564
01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:13.108
Medics are coming.

565
01:00:23.327 --> 01:00:24.411
Engineering to bridge.

566
01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:26.747
Cannot hold full power on force fields.

567
01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:29.333
Deflector power is down 70%.

568
01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:31.459
Divert auxiliary power to deflectors.

569
01:00:34.588 --> 01:00:36.881
Oh, good. Christine, it's Chekov.

570
01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:43.347
Medic.

571
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.889
I can stop his pain.

572
01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.741
Thank you.

573
01:01:19.925 --> 01:01:20.926
Captain.

574
01:01:22.344 --> 01:01:24.846
The intruder has been attempting
to communicate.

575
01:01:28.642 --> 01:01:31.770
Frequency, more than 1,000,000 megahertz.

576
01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.438
And at such a high rate of speed,

577
01:01:33.522 --> 01:01:35.982
their entire message
lasts only a millisecond.

578
01:01:36.066 --> 01:01:39.194
I am now programming our computer
to transmit linguacode

579
01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:41.321
at their frequency and rate of speed.

580
01:01:42.406 --> 01:01:43.407
Commander.

581
01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:53.708
Spock.

582
01:01:59.506 --> 01:02:00.673
Here it comes.

583
01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:02.694
Engineering,
what's happening to our force fields?

584
01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:05.554
Our shields cannot handle another attack.

585
01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.056
Mr. Spock.

586
01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:13.645
Impact in 20 seconds.

587
01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.107
Spock.

588
01:02:17.191 --> 01:02:18.609
Fifteen seconds.

589
01:02:19.443 --> 01:02:21.528
Spock. Transmit now.

590
01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:22.988
Ten seconds.

591
01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:24.907
Transmitting.

592
01:02:38.587 --> 01:02:40.505
It would seem our friendship messages

593
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:43.049
have been received and understood,
Mr. Spock.

594
01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:46.470
I would say
that was a logical assumption, Captain.

595
01:02:46.553 --> 01:02:49.430
One minute, 30 seconds to cloud boundary.

596
01:02:59.608 --> 01:03:00.775
Captain.

597
01:03:02.194 --> 01:03:05.113
We are obviously confronted
by a highly advanced mentality.

598
01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:10.281
Yet, they cannot understand
who we are or what we want.

599
01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:13.163
And yet it would seem
that they understood our message.

600
01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:14.748
They broke off the attack.

601
01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:17.084
They may have attacked
only as a warning to us, Captain.

602
01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:19.002
To keep away.

603
01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:22.923
That would presuppose a feeling,
Commander.

604
01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:24.632
Compassion.

605
01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:28.011
I sensed no emotion.

606
01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:31.764
Only pure logic.

607
01:03:37.396 --> 01:03:39.189
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.

608
01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:41.066
Holding present position, sir.

609
01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:42.734
Tactical plot on viewer.

610
01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.611
Course projection on tactical, sir.

611
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.369
Opinion, Mr. Spock.

612
01:03:52.911 --> 01:03:54.829
Recommend we proceed, Captain.

613
01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:56.457
Mr. Decker?

614
01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.166
I advise caution, Captain.

615
01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:00.877
We can't withstand another attack.

616
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:04.673
That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.
We know nothing about it as yet.

617
01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:07.468
Precisely the point, Captain.
We don't know what it'll do.

618
01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:12.765
Moving into that cloud at this time
is an unwarranted gamble.

619
01:04:14.266 --> 01:04:16.685
How do you define "unwarranted"?

620
01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.731
You asked my opinion, sir.

621
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.325
Viewer, standard ahead.

622
01:04:31.909 --> 01:04:33.535
Standard on viewer, sir.

623
01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:42.336
Navigator, maintain course.

624
01:04:42.419 --> 01:04:43.420
Helmsman...

625
01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:46.256
...steady as she goes.

626
01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:50.964
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

627
01:06:52.716 --> 01:06:53.717
Spock?

628
01:06:57.888 --> 01:06:59.723
Instruments fluctuating, Captain.

629
01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:04.227
Patterns unrecognizable.

630
01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:27.602
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.

631
01:08:27.686 --> 01:08:29.372
Advise we are attempting
further communication.

632
01:08:29.396 --> 01:08:31.940
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

633
01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:36.611
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud
is being reflected back.

634
01:08:45.704 --> 01:08:47.706
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.

635
01:08:56.423 --> 01:08:58.591
Reduce magnification,
factor four, Mr. Sulu.

636
01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:01.969
We're already two settings
below that, sir.

637
01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:07.059
Mr. Sulu,

638
01:09:08.352 --> 01:09:12.852
bring us into a parallel course
over the alien at 500 meters.

639
01:09:14.816 --> 01:09:16.484
500 meters?

640
01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:20.404
Then take us out
to 100 kilometers distance,

641
01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:22.282
adjusting parallel course.

642
01:09:23.909 --> 01:09:24.910
Aye, sir.

643
01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:13.351
Viewer astern.

644
01:11:13.977 --> 01:11:15.228
Viewer astern, sir.

645
01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:27.032
500 meters.

646
01:11:28.408 --> 01:11:29.951
Viewer ahead, sir.

647
01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:27.861
Hold relative position here.

648
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:12.901
Mr. Spock, can that be one of their crew?

649
01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:15.783
A probe from their vessel, Captain.

650
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.327
Plasma-energy combination.

651
01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:22.165
Don't interfere with it!

652
01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:25.001
Absolutely, I will not interfere.

653
01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:28.213
No one interfere.

654
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.050
It doesn't seem interested in us.

655
01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:33.760
Only the ship.

656
01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.527
Computer off,

657
01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:01.120
It's taken control of the computer.

658
01:15:07.544 --> 01:15:10.755
It's running our records.
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.

659
01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:47.584
Ilia!

660
01:15:51.796 --> 01:15:52.797
Ilia!

661
01:16:16.196 --> 01:16:18.281
This is how I define "unwarranted."

662
01:16:28.374 --> 01:16:31.335
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

663
01:16:42.847 --> 01:16:45.266
Captain, we've been seized
by a tractor beam.

664
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.560
Get someone up here
to take the navigator's station.

665
01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:49.371
- Engineering.
- Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.

666
01:16:49.395 --> 01:16:50.734
- On the double.
- Emergency power.

667
01:16:50.758 --> 01:16:52.342
Going to full emergency!

668
01:16:53.061 --> 01:16:57.441
But, Captain, if we don't break free
in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.

669
01:16:57.737 --> 01:16:59.447
We cannot break free, Captain.

670
01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:01.866
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

671
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.701
Engineering, belay that order.

672
01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:06.120
Disengage all main drive systems.

673
01:17:24.347 --> 01:17:27.350
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.

674
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.442
DiFalco, disengage
engine navigation relays now.

675
01:17:36.526 --> 01:17:37.527
Aye, sir.

676
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:41.196
Force field circuits E-10
through 14 show ready for reactivation.

677
01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:42.615
Confirm, please.

678
01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:46.285
Scotty, drive systems should be free now.

679
01:17:46.369 --> 01:17:47.495
Commander?

680
01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:49.664
Ready to launch
remote communications drone

681
01:17:49.747 --> 01:17:53.167
with complete ship's records,
including our present situation, sir.

682
01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:54.919
Delay launching as long as possible.

683
01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.630
Our drone can't escape
as long as we're held in their tractor.

684
01:17:57.714 --> 01:17:58.756
Aye.

685
01:18:24.407 --> 01:18:27.660
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam

686
01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:29.787
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

687
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.914
Break free to where, Commander?

688
01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.376
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

689
01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.170
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.

690
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:40.173
Why are you opposed to trying?

691
01:19:31.307 --> 01:19:32.850
Why bring us inside?

692
01:19:33.851 --> 01:19:37.312
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

693
01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:39.190
They still can.

694
01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.234
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.

695
01:19:43.069 --> 01:19:45.654
Insatiable curiosity.

696
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:57.542
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

697
01:19:58.543 --> 01:20:00.002
We're trapped, sir.

698
01:20:01.254 --> 01:20:03.130
Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

699
01:20:28.698 --> 01:20:30.658
Tractor beam has released us, Captain.

700
01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:32.618
Confirmed.

701
01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:34.245
Vessel is floating free.

702
01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.955
No forward momentum.

703
01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:39.583
Viewer ahead.

704
01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:40.959
Viewer ahead, sir.

705
01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:48.676
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

706
01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.886
Ahead one-third.

707
01:20:49.969 --> 01:20:51.845
Thrusters ahead, one-third.

708
01:20:57.727 --> 01:20:59.061
Let's take a look.

709
01:20:59.145 --> 01:21:00.771
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.

710
01:21:01.606 --> 01:21:03.774
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

711
01:21:03.858 --> 01:21:05.461
Now that we're looking down their throat.

712
01:21:05.485 --> 01:21:08.070
Right. Now that we've got them
just where they want us.

713
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.631
It's closing up.

714
01:21:29.967 --> 01:21:31.802
Hold position.

715
01:21:34.138 --> 01:21:35.222
Captain.

716
01:21:38.935 --> 01:21:41.103
All our scans are being reflected back.

717
01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:43.230
Sensors are useless.

718
01:21:44.315 --> 01:21:45.316
Damn!

719
01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:55.201
What do you make of all this?

720
01:21:55.284 --> 01:21:58.370
I believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber.

721
01:21:58.955 --> 01:22:01.332
Undoubtedly,
part of the vessel's inner mechanism.

722
01:22:02.291 --> 01:22:05.002
I suspect it may be necessary...

723
01:22:08.881 --> 01:22:10.716
Intruder alert!

724
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.968
Deck 5, Captain. Officers' quarters.

725
01:22:13.052 --> 01:22:15.220
Have Security meet me at deck 5.
Main elevator.

726
01:22:15.304 --> 01:22:18.348
Spock. Mr. Decker, you have the conn.
Hold position.

727
01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.810
Whatever it is, it's white Hot.

728
01:22:25.064 --> 01:22:28.108
Intruder is located
in the sonic shower, Captain.

729
01:22:28.192 --> 01:22:30.903
Surface temperature abnormally high.

730
01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:43.207
You are the Kirk unit.

731
01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:44.750
You will assist me.

732
01:22:47.211 --> 01:22:51.711
I've been programmed by V'Ger
to observe and record

733
01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:55.136
normal functions of the carbon-based units

734
01:22:55.219 --> 01:22:57.888
infesting USS Enterprise.

735
01:23:10.067 --> 01:23:11.068
Jim, what's going on?

736
01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.653
Tricorder.

737
01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:20.077
Who is... V'Ger?

738
01:23:20.912 --> 01:23:23.289
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

739
01:23:24.874 --> 01:23:28.085
Is V'Ger the name of the captain
of the alien vessel?

740
01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:32.381
Jim, this is a mechanism.

741
01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:33.757
A probe, Captain.

742
01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:40.722
No doubt, a sensor-transceiver combination
recording everything we say and do.

743
01:23:42.266 --> 01:23:43.600
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?

744
01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:46.354
That unit no longer functions.

745
01:23:46.437 --> 01:23:49.481
I've been given its form
to more readily communicate

746
01:23:49.565 --> 01:23:53.360
with the carbon-based units
infesting Enterprise.

747
01:23:53.444 --> 01:23:55.362
Carbon-based units?

748
01:23:55.446 --> 01:23:57.656
Humans, Ensign Perez.

749
01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.824
Us.

750
01:23:59.742 --> 01:24:04.242
Why does V'Ger travel to the third planet
of the solar system directly ahead?

751
01:24:05.665 --> 01:24:07.375
To find the Creator.

752
01:24:07.458 --> 01:24:09.793
Find the Creator?

753
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:12.630
Who's...

754
01:24:16.592 --> 01:24:18.844
What does V'Ger want with the Creator?

755
01:24:18.928 --> 01:24:20.262
To join with him.

756
01:24:20.346 --> 01:24:22.598
To join with the Creator?

757
01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:23.683
How?

758
01:24:23.766 --> 01:24:26.393
V'Ger and the Creator will become one.

759
01:24:26.477 --> 01:24:28.270
And who is the Creator?

760
01:24:28.354 --> 01:24:30.898
The Creator is that which created V'Ger.

761
01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:32.441
Who is V'Ger?

762
01:24:32.525 --> 01:24:34.860
V'Ger is that which seeks the Creator.

763
01:24:39.323 --> 01:24:42.034
I'm ready to commence my observations.

764
01:24:42.785 --> 01:24:46.455
Doctor, a thorough examination
of this probe might provide some insight

765
01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:49.375
into those who manufactured it
and how to deal with them.

766
01:24:50.751 --> 01:24:53.044
Fine. Let's get her to sickbay.

767
01:24:57.466 --> 01:24:59.801
I am programmed to observe and record

768
01:24:59.885 --> 01:25:02.554
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

769
01:25:02.638 --> 01:25:07.017
The... examination is a normal function.

770
01:25:09.812 --> 01:25:11.396
You may proceed.

771
01:25:17.695 --> 01:25:19.905
Micro-miniature hydraulics...

772
01:25:22.825 --> 01:25:24.409
Sensors...

773
01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:32.042
and molecule-sized multi-processor chips.

774
01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:38.507
And take a look at this.

775
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:41.802
Osmotic micro-pump right here.

776
01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:44.847
And even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

777
01:25:48.559 --> 01:25:50.769
Every exocrine system is the same too.

778
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:53.563
Even eye moisture.

779
01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:56.734
Decker.

780
01:25:57.902 --> 01:26:00.696
Fascinating. Not "Decker unit."

781
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:06.911
Gentlemen.

782
01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:09.080
Will.

783
01:26:20.132 --> 01:26:21.341
What happened to her?

784
01:26:21.425 --> 01:26:24.886
Captain, this probe may be our key
to the aliens.

785
01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:26.096
Probe?

786
01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.931
- Ilia?
- Exactly.

787
01:26:28.015 --> 01:26:30.225
It is a programmed mechanism, Commander.

788
01:26:30.309 --> 01:26:33.437
Its body duplicates our navigator
in precise detail.

789
01:26:34.063 --> 01:26:36.231
Suppose that beneath its programming,

790
01:26:36.315 --> 01:26:40.110
the real Ilia's memory patterns
are duplicated with equal precision.

791
01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:42.529
- They had a pattern to follow.
- Indeed.

792
01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:45.324
They may have followed it too precisely.

793
01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:46.742
Ilia's memory,

794
01:26:47.451 --> 01:26:50.120
her feelings
of loyalty, obedience, friendship

795
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.331
might all be there.

796
01:26:53.165 --> 01:26:57.210
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

797
01:26:57.294 --> 01:27:00.046
That probe, in another form,
is what killed Ilia!

798
01:27:00.131 --> 01:27:01.132
Commander!

799
01:27:02.007 --> 01:27:06.011
Will, we're locked in an alien vessel,
six hours from Earth orbit.

800
01:27:06.095 --> 01:27:08.555
Our only contact with our captor
is that probe.

801
01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:10.439
If we could control it,
persuade it, use it...

802
01:27:14.478 --> 01:27:16.563
I have recorded enough here.

803
01:27:16.647 --> 01:27:18.732
You will now assist me further.

804
01:27:22.027 --> 01:27:26.114
The... Decker unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

805
01:27:31.704 --> 01:27:33.789
Carry on with your assignment, Mr. Decker.

806
01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:36.917
Aye, sir.

807
01:27:41.464 --> 01:27:45.468
I am concerned with that being
our only source of information, Captain.

808
01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:52.599
Captain's Log, Stardate 7414.7.

809
01:27:53.476 --> 01:27:56.812
Our best estimates place us
some four hours from Earth.

810
01:27:57.354 --> 01:27:59.522
No significant progress thus far

811
01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:02.610
reviving Ilia memory patterns
within the alien probe.

812
01:28:03.402 --> 01:28:07.447
This remains our only means of contact
with our captor.

813
01:28:07.531 --> 01:28:09.449
All those vessels were called Enterprise.

814
01:28:21.378 --> 01:28:23.713
The carbon units use this area
for recreation.

815
01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:27.092
This is one of the games.

816
01:28:32.223 --> 01:28:35.893
What types of recreation
does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

817
01:28:37.102 --> 01:28:38.895
The words "recreation"

818
01:28:40.397 --> 01:28:41.773
and "enjoy"

819
01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.860
have no meaning to my programming.

820
01:28:53.410 --> 01:28:55.036
Ilia enjoyed this game.

821
01:28:57.456 --> 01:28:58.957
She nearly always won.

822
01:29:05.005 --> 01:29:08.216
Good. He's using audio-visual association.

823
01:29:44.795 --> 01:29:46.713
This device serves no purpose.

824
01:29:58.309 --> 01:30:01.437
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

825
01:30:02.771 --> 01:30:05.732
Enterprise would be unable to function
without carbon units.

826
01:30:06.984 --> 01:30:10.112
More data concerning this functioning
is necessary

827
01:30:10.195 --> 01:30:14.199
before carbon units can be patterned
for data storage.

828
01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:19.788
What does that mean?

829
01:30:20.372 --> 01:30:22.916
When my examination is complete,

830
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.795
all carbon units will be reduced
to data patterns.

831
01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:31.921
Within you are the memory patterns
of a certain carbon unit.

832
01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:34.803
If I can help you
to revive those patterns,

833
01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:37.723
you could understand our functions better.

834
01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.768
That is logical.

835
01:30:40.851 --> 01:30:42.102
You may proceed.

836
01:31:26.397 --> 01:31:29.983
I remember Lieutenant Ilia
once mentioning she wore that.

837
01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:36.073
Put it on.

838
01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:02.516
On Delta.

839
01:32:04.059 --> 01:32:05.560
Remember?

840
01:32:05.644 --> 01:32:06.645
Ilia?

841
01:32:13.193 --> 01:32:14.569
Dr. Chapel.

842
01:32:26.665 --> 01:32:27.666
Will?

843
01:32:29.668 --> 01:32:30.669
Ilia.

844
01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:33.255
Commander.

845
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:36.091
Commander!

846
01:32:39.094 --> 01:32:40.804
This is a mechanism.

847
01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:45.726
Ilia...

848
01:32:47.644 --> 01:32:51.189
help us make direct contact with V'Ger.

849
01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:53.192
I cannot.

850
01:32:53.275 --> 01:32:57.279
Wh... This Creator V'Ger is looking for...

851
01:32:57.988 --> 01:32:58.989
What is it?

852
01:33:00.324 --> 01:33:02.576
V'Ger does not know.

853
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:32.189
Computer, commence recording.

854
01:33:33.524 --> 01:33:38.024
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail
my attempt to contact the aliens.

855
01:33:46.495 --> 01:33:49.789
I intend to calculate thruster ignition
and acceleration rate

856
01:33:49.873 --> 01:33:52.500
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

857
01:33:52.584 --> 01:33:56.588
This should facilitate a better view
of the interior of the alien spacecraft.

858
01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:03.262
Captain?

859
01:34:03.345 --> 01:34:05.805
Starfleet signals
are growing in strength, sir.

860
01:34:05.889 --> 01:34:08.308
They still have the intruder
on their monitors.

861
01:34:08.392 --> 01:34:10.685
- It's decelerating.
- Confirmed, sir.

862
01:34:10.769 --> 01:34:14.230
Lunar beacons indicate intruder
on a course into Earth orbit.

863
01:34:14.314 --> 01:34:17.650
Sir, airlock 4 has been opened.

864
01:34:17.734 --> 01:34:20.027
A thruster suit is reported missing.

865
01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:23.531
A thruster suit?

866
01:34:25.784 --> 01:34:26.868
That's Spock.

867
01:34:27.703 --> 01:34:28.704
Damn him.

868
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.373
Bring him back here.

869
01:34:31.456 --> 01:34:32.457
No, wait.

870
01:34:40.215 --> 01:34:42.592
- Get a fix on his position.
- Aye, sir.

871
01:36:03.632 --> 01:36:07.302
I have successfully penetrated
the next chamber of the alien's interior,

872
01:36:07.886 --> 01:36:10.680
and I'm witnessing
some sort of dimensional image

873
01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:14.309
which I believe to be a representation
of V'Ger's home planet.

874
01:36:22.901 --> 01:36:24.652
I'm passing through a connecting tunnel.

875
01:36:24.736 --> 01:36:27.989
Apparently,
a kind of plasma energy conduit,

876
01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:31.785
possibly a field coil
for a gigantic imaging system.

877
01:36:43.046 --> 01:36:44.255
Curious.

878
01:36:44.339 --> 01:36:46.174
I'm seeing images of planets,

879
01:36:46.258 --> 01:36:48.885
moons, stars, whole galaxies,

880
01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:50.929
all stored here, recorded.

881
01:36:51.013 --> 01:36:53.640
It could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

882
01:36:59.771 --> 01:37:03.399
But who or what are we dealing with?

883
01:37:03.483 --> 01:37:07.653
The Epsilon IX station,
stored here with every detail.

884
01:37:15.746 --> 01:37:19.291
Captain, I am now quite convinced
that all of this is V'Ger,

885
01:37:20.083 --> 01:37:23.086
that we are inside a living machine.

886
01:37:28.633 --> 01:37:29.675
Ilia.

887
01:37:34.765 --> 01:37:39.265
The sensor must contain
some special meaning.

888
01:37:43.607 --> 01:37:45.358
I must try to mind-meld with it.

889
01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.080
Spock.

890
01:38:41.123 --> 01:38:42.124
Spock!

891
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:44.751
Spock!

892
01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:03.937
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fiber connection.

893
01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:11.069
Indications of some neurological trauma.

894
01:39:12.028 --> 01:39:15.364
The power pouring through that mind-meld
must have been staggering.

895
01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:24.124
Spock.

896
01:39:24.749 --> 01:39:25.750
Jim.

897
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.129
I should have known.

898
01:39:31.339 --> 01:39:33.841
Were you right? About V'Ger?

899
01:39:35.427 --> 01:39:37.137
A life-form of its own.

900
01:39:38.763 --> 01:39:40.931
A conscious, living entity.

901
01:39:41.558 --> 01:39:42.809
A living machine?

902
01:39:42.893 --> 01:39:44.728
It considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

903
01:39:44.811 --> 01:39:47.146
That's why the probe refers to our ship
as an entity.

904
01:39:47.230 --> 01:39:49.357
I saw V'Ger's planet,

905
01:39:50.525 --> 01:39:53.319
a planet populated by living machines.

906
01:39:54.237 --> 01:39:56.113
Unbelievable technology.

907
01:39:58.783 --> 01:40:02.203
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

908
01:40:03.872 --> 01:40:07.542
And yet, with all its pure logic,

909
01:40:08.835 --> 01:40:12.380
V'Ger is barren, cold.

910
01:40:12.464 --> 01:40:13.882
No mystery.

911
01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.967
No beauty.

912
01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:23.266
I should've known.

913
01:40:25.143 --> 01:40:26.144
Known?

914
01:40:27.395 --> 01:40:29.188
Known what? Spock.

915
01:40:29.898 --> 01:40:31.649
What should you have known?

916
01:40:32.317 --> 01:40:33.693
What should you have known?

917
01:40:38.949 --> 01:40:39.950
Jim.

918
01:40:44.329 --> 01:40:47.957
This simple feeling...

919
01:40:49.751 --> 01:40:52.003
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

920
01:41:00.887 --> 01:41:02.263
No meaning.

921
01:41:02.347 --> 01:41:03.431
No hope.

922
01:41:04.891 --> 01:41:05.975
And, Jim,

923
01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:08.895
NO answers.

924
01:41:11.022 --> 01:41:12.773
It's asking questions.

925
01:41:12.857 --> 01:41:16.861
"Is this all that I am?"

926
01:41:18.363 --> 01:41:20.365
"Is there nothing more?"

927
01:41:26.288 --> 01:41:27.622
Bridge to Captain.

928
01:41:31.543 --> 01:41:32.544
Kirk here.

929
01:41:33.128 --> 01:41:34.963
A faint signal from Starfleet, sir.

930
01:41:35.755 --> 01:41:38.466
Intruder cloud has been located
on their outer monitors

931
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:40.176
for the past 27 minutes.

932
01:41:40.677 --> 01:41:43.429
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

933
01:41:44.222 --> 01:41:47.934
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

934
01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:49.978
We are three minutes from Earth orbit.

935
01:41:50.061 --> 01:41:51.270
I'll be right there.

936
01:41:56.151 --> 01:41:57.652
I need Spock on the bridge.

937
01:41:58.361 --> 01:42:00.404
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

938
01:42:20.717 --> 01:42:24.262
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

939
01:42:26.056 --> 01:42:29.350
V'Ger is transmitting... a signal.

940
01:42:32.937 --> 01:42:33.938
Jim.

941
01:42:35.398 --> 01:42:36.399
From V'Ger?

942
01:42:38.568 --> 01:42:40.319
Who the hell is it sending a signal to?

943
01:42:41.112 --> 01:42:43.531
V'Ger signals the Creator.

944
01:42:46.701 --> 01:42:47.702
Spock?

945
01:42:49.371 --> 01:42:51.373
A simple binary code

946
01:42:51.998 --> 01:42:54.500
transmitted by carrier wave signal.

947
01:42:56.086 --> 01:42:57.087
Radio.

948
01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:00.632
Radio?

949
01:43:05.845 --> 01:43:07.388
Jim.

950
01:43:07.472 --> 01:43:10.141
V'Ger expects an answer.

951
01:43:11.309 --> 01:43:12.643
An answer?

952
01:43:12.727 --> 01:43:14.311
I don't know the question.

953
01:43:15.563 --> 01:43:17.690
The Creator has not responded.

954
01:43:29.661 --> 01:43:32.955
All planetary defense systems
have just gone inoperative.

955
01:44:13.538 --> 01:44:17.416
Sir, Starfleet computes
the devices are proceeding

956
01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:20.419
toward equidistant positions,
orbiting the planet.

957
01:44:20.503 --> 01:44:22.338
They're the same things that hit us.

958
01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:25.258
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

959
01:44:25.341 --> 01:44:26.550
From those positions,

960
01:44:26.634 --> 01:44:29.219
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

961
01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:43.610
Why?

962
01:44:44.235 --> 01:44:46.487
The Creator has not answered.

963
01:44:47.071 --> 01:44:48.781
The carbon-unit infestation

964
01:44:48.865 --> 01:44:50.700
is to be removed
from the Creator's planet.

965
01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:53.787
- Why?
- You infest Enterprise.

966
01:44:54.662 --> 01:44:57.247
You interfere with the Creator
in the same manner.

967
01:44:57.332 --> 01:44:59.667
Carbon units are not an infestation.

968
01:45:01.169 --> 01:45:05.047
They are a natural function
of the Creator's planet.

969
01:45:06.382 --> 01:45:07.466
They are living things.

970
01:45:08.051 --> 01:45:09.886
They are not true life-forms.

971
01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:14.098
Only the Creator
and other similar life-forms are true.

972
01:45:14.182 --> 01:45:16.017
"Similar life-forms."

973
01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:21.438
Jim, V'Ger's saying its Creator
is a machine.

974
01:45:24.025 --> 01:45:25.401
Machine.

975
01:45:39.457 --> 01:45:40.458
Captain.

976
01:45:45.547 --> 01:45:47.882
V'Ger is a child.

977
01:45:49.092 --> 01:45:50.760
I suggest you treat her as such.

978
01:45:50.844 --> 01:45:53.805
- A child?
- Yes, Captain. A child.

979
01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:57.725
Evolving, learning, searching,

980
01:45:59.143 --> 01:46:01.103
instinctively needing.

981
01:46:01.187 --> 01:46:02.354
Needing what?

982
01:46:02.981 --> 01:46:07.443
Spock, this child is about to wipe out
every living thing on Earth.

983
01:46:08.403 --> 01:46:11.364
Now, what do you suggest we do? Spank it?

984
01:46:14.576 --> 01:46:16.869
It knows only that it needs, Commander.

985
01:46:18.162 --> 01:46:19.788
But like so many of us,

986
01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.916
it does not know what.

987
01:46:36.097 --> 01:46:39.558
The carbon units know
why the Creator has not responded.

988
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:45.022
Disclose the information.

989
01:46:45.106 --> 01:46:48.734
Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices
orbiting the third planet.

990
01:46:48.818 --> 01:46:49.819
Captain!

991
01:46:52.447 --> 01:46:55.283
I'm losing Starfleet.
Interference from V'Ger.

992
01:46:56.451 --> 01:47:00.371
Kirk unit, disclose the information.

993
01:47:00.955 --> 01:47:04.375
Why has the Creator not responded?

994
01:47:04.459 --> 01:47:05.460
No.

995
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:12.174
Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.

996
01:47:15.678 --> 01:47:17.096
Clear the bridge, Captain?

997
01:47:18.139 --> 01:47:20.015
That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
Clear the bridge.

998
01:47:20.099 --> 01:47:21.100
Aye, sir.

999
01:47:28.316 --> 01:47:31.360
Your child is having a tantrum, Mr. Spock.

1000
01:47:33.488 --> 01:47:35.573
V'Ger requires the information.

1001
01:47:39.077 --> 01:47:41.871
Bridge. Secure all stations. Move out.

1002
01:47:41.955 --> 01:47:44.207
Jim, what the hell
Kind of strategy is this?

1003
01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:48.586
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

1004
01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:50.296
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise,

1005
01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:52.799
the information that V'Ger requires
will also be destroyed.

1006
01:47:52.882 --> 01:47:55.759
It is illogical
to withhold required information.

1007
01:47:57.011 --> 01:47:58.595
Kirk unit!

1008
01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.889
Kirk unit.

1009
01:48:03.267 --> 01:48:05.352
Why do you not disclose information?

1010
01:48:09.607 --> 01:48:12.860
Because V'Ger's going to destroy
all the carbon units on the third planet.

1011
01:48:12.944 --> 01:48:14.862
They have repressed the Creator.

1012
01:48:14.946 --> 01:48:16.906
The information will not be disclosed.

1013
01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.660
V'Ger needs the information.

1014
01:48:21.244 --> 01:48:25.206
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

1015
01:48:26.624 --> 01:48:31.124
V'Ger will comply if the carbon units
will disclose the information.

1016
01:48:38.177 --> 01:48:40.179
It learns fast, doesn't it?

1017
01:48:40.263 --> 01:48:41.597
Captain,

1018
01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:43.599
the vessel, V'Ger,

1019
01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:46.769
obviously operates
from a central brain complex.

1020
01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:50.398
The orbiting devices
would be controlled from that point then?

1021
01:48:50.481 --> 01:48:51.482
Precisely.

1022
01:49:01.868 --> 01:49:05.663
The carbon unit's information
cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe,

1023
01:49:05.747 --> 01:49:08.499
but only to V'Ger directly.

1024
01:49:31.856 --> 01:49:33.732
Forward motion, Captain.

1025
01:49:33.816 --> 01:49:34.900
Tractor beam.

1026
01:49:52.168 --> 01:49:55.087
Captain, what's the next move?

1027
01:49:56.964 --> 01:50:00.384
The question is, Mr. Decker,
is there a next move?

1028
01:50:03.805 --> 01:50:05.431
Resume duty stations.

1029
01:50:06.891 --> 01:50:08.517
All personnel, resume stations.

1030
01:50:14.273 --> 01:50:15.399
Well, Mr. Decker,

1031
01:50:16.526 --> 01:50:18.444
it seems my bluff has been called.

1032
01:50:20.446 --> 01:50:22.573
I'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

1033
01:50:27.495 --> 01:50:30.748
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

1034
01:50:31.541 --> 01:50:34.252
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.

1035
01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:58.901
Engineering.

1036
01:50:58.985 --> 01:50:59.986
Scott' here.

1037
01:51:01.404 --> 01:51:05.616
Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute
Starfleet order 2-0-0-5.

1038
01:51:06.409 --> 01:51:07.451
When, sir?

1039
01:51:09.412 --> 01:51:10.538
On my command.

1040
01:51:10.621 --> 01:51:11.622
Aye, sir.

1041
01:51:14.125 --> 01:51:17.002
Why has the captain
ordered self-destruct, sir?

1042
01:51:17.086 --> 01:51:18.879
I would say, lass, because he thinks...

1043
01:51:19.463 --> 01:51:23.963
He hopes that when we go up,
we'll take the intruder with us.

1044
01:51:24.385 --> 01:51:25.386
Will we?

1045
01:51:25.469 --> 01:51:27.750
When that much matter and antimatter
are brought together,

1046
01:51:27.805 --> 01:51:30.224
oh, yes, we will indeed.

1047
01:51:41.152 --> 01:51:44.864
Eighteen minutes
to device activation, sir.

1048
01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:49.660
Gravity control,
give me an all-decks readout.

1049
01:51:50.828 --> 01:51:53.997
Starfleet has been apprised
of our situation, Captain.

1050
01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:58.168
Crew status is 172 at duly stations,

1051
01:51:58.836 --> 01:52:02.881
248 off-duty, 11 in sickbay, all minor.

1052
01:52:02.965 --> 01:52:04.800
Tractor beam remains constant.

1053
01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:11.056
We are 17 kilometers inside the vessel.

1054
01:52:12.016 --> 01:52:15.102
Engineering,
show me your pylon stress readings.

1055
01:52:15.603 --> 01:52:20.103
Deck 4, that
temperature should read 1-0-1-3 degrees.

1056
01:52:20.358 --> 01:52:21.567
Please confirm.

1057
01:52:29.575 --> 01:52:30.576
Spock?

1058
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:35.122
Mr. Spock.

1059
01:52:35.998 --> 01:52:37.249
I think...

1060
01:52:46.968 --> 01:52:48.052
Not for us?

1061
01:52:49.178 --> 01:52:50.888
No, Captain. Not for us.

1062
01:52:52.265 --> 01:52:53.266
For V'Ger.

1063
01:52:56.602 --> 01:52:59.354
I weep for V'Ger as I would for a brother.

1064
01:53:01.983 --> 01:53:03.776
As I was when I came aboard,

1065
01:53:05.486 --> 01:53:07.196
so is V'Ger now.

1066
01:53:07.989 --> 01:53:10.908
Empty, incomplete and searching.

1067
01:53:11.742 --> 01:53:15.787
Logic and knowledge are not enough.

1068
01:53:15.871 --> 01:53:19.249
Spock, are you saying
that you found what you needed,

1069
01:53:20.167 --> 01:53:21.334
but V'Ger hasn't?

1070
01:53:21.419 --> 01:53:24.422
What would V'Ger need to fulfill itself?

1071
01:53:25.089 --> 01:53:28.383
Each of us, at some time in our lives,

1072
01:53:28.467 --> 01:53:30.218
turns to someone...

1073
01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:33.055
A father, a brother, a god...

1074
01:53:33.139 --> 01:53:34.390
And asks,

1075
01:53:35.599 --> 01:53:37.475
"Why am I here?

1076
01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:39.395
What was I meant to be?"

1077
01:53:41.188 --> 01:53:45.688
V'Ger hopes to touch its Creator
to find its answers.

1078
01:53:48.779 --> 01:53:51.782
"Is this all that I am?
Is there nothing more?"

1079
01:53:54.118 --> 01:53:55.119
Captain.

1080
01:54:06.881 --> 01:54:08.757
Forward motion slowing, Captain.

1081
01:54:10.593 --> 01:54:13.012
Captain,
I believe that is our destination.

1082
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:24.815
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

1083
01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:35.659
Forward motion stopped, Captain.

1084
01:54:40.289 --> 01:54:41.290
V'Ger.

1085
01:54:41.957 --> 01:54:45.877
Sir, I've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

1086
01:54:45.961 --> 01:54:47.337
It's directly ahead.

1087
01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:51.716
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its Creator.

1088
01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:59.721
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger
with the required information.

1089
01:55:07.483 --> 01:55:09.651
Mr. Spock? Bones?

1090
01:55:13.364 --> 01:55:14.448
Mr. Decker.

1091
01:55:15.574 --> 01:55:17.242
I will contact you every five minutes.

1092
01:55:17.326 --> 01:55:18.577
Captain...

1093
01:55:21.288 --> 01:55:22.580
I'd like to go along.

1094
01:55:26.377 --> 01:55:27.961
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

1095
01:57:23.077 --> 01:57:24.078
V'Ger.

1096
01:58:36.734 --> 01:58:40.404
"V-G-E-R."

1097
01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.241
V'Ger.

1098
01:58:58.255 --> 01:59:01.049
"V-O-Y-A-G-E-R."

1099
01:59:01.592 --> 01:59:02.593
Voyager!

1100
01:59:07.056 --> 01:59:08.682
Voyager VI.

1101
01:59:08.766 --> 01:59:09.767
NASA.

1102
01:59:10.643 --> 01:59:13.354
National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

1103
01:59:13.437 --> 01:59:17.899
Jim, this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

1104
01:59:21.695 --> 01:59:22.696
Voyager series.

1105
01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:26.616
Designed to collect data...

1106
01:59:29.787 --> 01:59:31.330
and transmit it back to Earth.

1107
02:00:11.161 --> 02:00:12.162
Captain.

1108
02:00:13.163 --> 02:00:17.663
Voyager VI disappeared
into what they used to call a black hole.

1109
02:00:18.085 --> 02:00:21.004
It must have emerged
on the far side of the galaxy

1110
02:00:22.172 --> 02:00:24.883
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

1111
02:00:25.467 --> 02:00:28.887
The machine inhabitants
found it to be one of their own kind.

1112
02:00:28.971 --> 02:00:30.722
Primitive, yet kindred.

1113
02:00:31.682 --> 02:00:34.476
They discovered
its simple 20th-century programming.

1114
02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:36.853
"Collect all data possible."

1115
02:00:38.355 --> 02:00:39.856
"Learn all that is learnable."

1116
02:00:42.317 --> 02:00:44.360
Return that information to its Creator.

1117
02:00:45.070 --> 02:00:46.404
Precisely, Mr. Decker.

1118
02:00:47.364 --> 02:00:49.824
The machines interpreted it literally.

1119
02:00:49.908 --> 02:00:51.492
They built this entire vessel

1120
02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:54.288
so that Voyager
could actually fulfill its programming.

1121
02:00:55.622 --> 02:00:56.956
And on its journey back...

1122
02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:01.420
it amassed so much knowledge...

1123
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:05.674
it achieved consciousness itself.

1124
02:01:07.718 --> 02:01:09.636
It became a living thing.

1125
02:01:24.067 --> 02:01:25.068
Kirk unit.

1126
02:01:25.986 --> 02:01:27.904
V'Ger awaits the information.

1127
02:01:29.364 --> 02:01:30.823
Enterprise,

1128
02:01:32.159 --> 02:01:34.494
order up
the ship's computer library records

1129
02:01:34.578 --> 02:01:37.998
on the late 20th-century NASA probe,
Voyager V.

1130
02:01:38.081 --> 02:01:40.833
Specifically,
we want the old NASA code signal

1131
02:01:40.918 --> 02:01:43.086
that instructs the probe
to transmit its data.

1132
02:01:43.170 --> 02:01:45.297
- And fast, Uhura, fast.
- Aye, sir.

1133
02:01:45.839 --> 02:01:49.801
That's what it's been signaling...
its readiness to transmit its information.

1134
02:01:49.885 --> 02:01:51.636
And there's no one on Earth

1135
02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:54.180
who could recognize the old signal
and send a response.

1136
02:01:54.264 --> 02:01:56.432
"The Creator does not answer."

1137
02:02:07.152 --> 02:02:08.153
V'Ger.

1138
02:02:14.576 --> 02:02:15.618
V'Ger.

1139
02:02:17.996 --> 02:02:19.205
V'Ger!

1140
02:02:23.961 --> 02:02:26.004
We are the Creator.

1141
02:02:26.713 --> 02:02:28.715
That is not logical.

1142
02:02:28.799 --> 02:02:30.842
Carbon units are not true life-forms.

1143
02:02:30.926 --> 02:02:31.927
We will prove it.

1144
02:02:32.010 --> 02:02:35.096
We will make it possible
for you to complete your programming.

1145
02:02:36.431 --> 02:02:38.641
Only the Creator could accomplish that.

1146
02:02:41.144 --> 02:02:42.145
Enterprise.

1147
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:45.190
We have just received
the response code, Captain.

1148
02:02:45.274 --> 02:02:47.901
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency

1149
02:02:47.985 --> 02:02:49.444
and transmit the code now.

1150
02:02:50.404 --> 02:02:51.488
Transmitting.

1151
02:02:52.638 --> 02:02:54.265
"5-0-4..."

1152
02:02:55.203 --> 02:02:56.871
"...3-2-9,"

1153
02:02:57.703 --> 02:02:59.037
"3-1-7,"

1154
02:02:59.788 --> 02:03:01.539
"5-1-0,"

1155
02:03:02.515 --> 02:03:03.962
and the final sequence...

1156
02:03:04.636 --> 02:03:06.949
That should trigger Voyager's transmitter.

1157
02:03:19.933 --> 02:03:22.518
Voyager is not transmitting its data,
Captain.

1158
02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:26.857
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

1159
02:03:29.610 --> 02:03:32.404
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.

1160
02:03:36.992 --> 02:03:39.619
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

1161
02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:02.726
Voyager is not transmitting, Captain,

1162
02:04:02.809 --> 02:04:05.269
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

1163
02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:08.065
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.

1164
02:04:08.649 --> 02:04:09.858
Enterprise, stand by.

1165
02:04:18.909 --> 02:04:21.828
- The antenna leads are melted away.
- Yes, Captain, just now.

1166
02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.206
By V'Ger itself.

1167
02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:26.499
Why?

1168
02:04:26.583 --> 02:04:27.875
To prevent reception.

1169
02:04:28.543 --> 02:04:29.794
Of course.

1170
02:04:29.878 --> 02:04:31.629
To bring the Creator here.

1171
02:04:32.673 --> 02:04:34.800
To finish transmitting the code in person.

1172
02:04:39.388 --> 02:04:40.722
To touch the Creator.

1173
02:04:43.141 --> 02:04:44.433
Capture God?

1174
02:04:45.435 --> 02:04:48.146
V'Ger's liable to be in for
one hell of a disappointment.

1175
02:04:48.730 --> 02:04:50.273
Perhaps not, Doctor.

1176
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:15.006
Captain.

1177
02:05:21.972 --> 02:05:23.682
V'Ger must evolve.

1178
02:05:23.765 --> 02:05:25.975
Its knowledge has reached
the limits of this universe,

1179
02:05:26.059 --> 02:05:27.810
and it must evolve.

1180
02:05:27.894 --> 02:05:31.147
What it requires of its god, Doctor,
is the answer to its question,

1181
02:05:31.231 --> 02:05:32.607
"Is there nothing more?"

1182
02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:35.443
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

1183
02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:37.487
Other dimensions, higher levels of being.

1184
02:05:37.571 --> 02:05:40.156
The existence of which
cannot be proven logically.

1185
02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:43.368
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

1186
02:05:43.452 --> 02:05:47.122
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve
is a human quality.

1187
02:05:48.457 --> 02:05:50.459
Our capacity to leap beyond logic.

1188
02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:57.465
And joining with its Creator
might accomplish that.

1189
02:05:57.549 --> 02:06:00.552
You mean, this machine
wants to physically join with a human?

1190
02:06:01.553 --> 02:06:03.179
Is that possible?

1191
02:06:06.767 --> 02:06:07.976
Let's find out.

1192
02:06:16.935 --> 02:06:17.935
Decker!

1193
02:06:18.062 --> 02:06:20.905
I'm going to key the final sequence
through the ground test computer.

1194
02:06:20.989 --> 02:06:22.949
Decker, you don't know
what that'll do to you!

1195
02:06:23.617 --> 02:06:25.118
Yes, I do, Doctor.

1196
02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:33.043
Decker, don't!

1197
02:06:33.126 --> 02:06:35.586
Jim, I want this.

1198
02:06:36.213 --> 02:06:40.425
As much as you wanted the Enterprise,
I want this.

1199
02:09:38.603 --> 02:09:39.604
Captain.

1200
02:09:41.606 --> 02:09:42.732
Spock,

1201
02:09:44.025 --> 02:09:46.193
did we just see
the beginning of a new life-form?

1202
02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:48.697
Yes, Captain. We witnessed a birth.

1203
02:09:49.572 --> 02:09:51.657
Possibly, a next step in our evolution.

1204
02:09:52.325 --> 02:09:53.326
I wonder.

1205
02:09:54.077 --> 02:09:57.038
Well, it's been a long time
since I delivered a baby,

1206
02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:59.082
and I hope we got this one off
to a good start.

1207
02:09:59.165 --> 02:10:00.583
I hope so too.

1208
02:10:01.876 --> 02:10:05.838
I think we gave it the ability
to create its own sense of purpose...

1209
02:10:07.465 --> 02:10:09.216
out of our own human weaknesses...

1210
02:10:11.219 --> 02:10:13.721
and the drive that compels us
to overcome them.

1211
02:10:13.805 --> 02:10:17.642
And a lot of foolish human emotions,
right, Mr. Spock?

1212
02:10:17.726 --> 02:10:18.810
Quite true, Doctor.

1213
02:10:19.519 --> 02:10:23.397
Unfortunately,
it will have to deal with them as well.

1214
02:10:23.481 --> 02:10:25.191
Interrogative from Starfleet.

1215
02:10:25.275 --> 02:10:27.277
They're requesting
damage and injury reports

1216
02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:28.861
and complete vessel status.

1217
02:10:28.945 --> 02:10:30.321
Report two casualties.

1218
02:10:31.323 --> 02:10:32.324
Lieutenant Ilia.

1219
02:10:34.451 --> 02:10:35.660
Captain Decker.

1220
02:10:35.744 --> 02:10:36.745
Aye, sir.

1221
02:10:36.828 --> 02:10:39.330
Correction. They're not casualties.

1222
02:10:39.414 --> 02:10:40.415
They are...

1223
02:10:44.044 --> 02:10:45.670
List them as missing.

1224
02:10:46.588 --> 02:10:48.673
Vessel status, fully operational.

1225
02:10:48.757 --> 02:10:49.758
Aye, sir.

1226
02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:51.843
Mr. Scott.

1227
02:10:52.927 --> 02:10:55.971
Shall we give the Enterprise
a proper shakedown?

1228
02:10:56.056 --> 02:10:58.892
I would say it's time for that, sir. Aye.

1229
02:10:58.975 --> 02:11:01.852
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr. Spock.

1230
02:11:01.936 --> 02:11:03.729
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.

1231
02:11:04.439 --> 02:11:06.899
My task on Vulcan is completed.

1232
02:11:08.318 --> 02:11:10.737
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1.

1233
02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:11.946
Warp 1, sir.

1234
02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:13.114
Heading, sir?

1235
02:11:17.452 --> 02:11:18.453
Out there.

1236
02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:22.040
Thataway.
