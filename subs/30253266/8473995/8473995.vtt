How's Elena?

62
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.376
As big as a house.
She says hi, by the way.

63
00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:32.279
I bet she's ready
for this part to be over with.

You taking some time off?

65
00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.084
Yeah. Just let me
ask my boss.

Well, you know me.

67
00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.954
I'm a "mission first" guy.

68
00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.422
The bigger question is,

69
00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.391
are you ready to be a dad?

70
00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:48.228
Were you?

71
00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:51.199
Nope.

<i>that you would.</i>

<i>you'd get your hearing back.</i>

82
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.257
<i>I insisted.</i>

[doctor, echoing]
It's extremely rare.

84
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:22.262
The injury to his ears
has made them hypersensitive

85
00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:23.931
to the point of pain.

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.871
So he can hear?

90
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:31.706
He can hear everything.

[cacophony roars]

92
00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:34.709
In time,
he'll learn to filter out

93
00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.644
the different sounds
so he can function.

94
00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:40.581
It would be a terrible weakness
if he can't control it.

95
00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:42.482
Or a strength.

I can't take the place
of your father,

106
00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.107
but if you give me a chance,

107
00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:08.810
maybe we can make
a family of our own.

108
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.578
You know,
there's plenty of stuff

109
00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:13.114
I'd do over again,
if I had half the chance,

110
00:05:13.214 --> 00:05:17.450
but adopting you, helping you
become the man you've become...

111
00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:19.486
You're the best thing
I ever did.

112
00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:22.757
You're gonna be my legacy.

A biometric watch?

Contains a hard drive
with sole access

121
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:51.919
to his contacts, stolen intel,
and the account numbers

122
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:53.453
of the hundreds of millions
he's made

123
00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.089
selling out our country.

124
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.324

I thought he went off-grid
years ago. Retired.

556

Well, the eight dead federal
agents would say otherwise.

after all this time?

of being in possession

Does the old man know?

He's about to.
And we're gonna do the honors.

Well, there's always

Just depends
on where you find it.

Oh, yes. You and I

Good to see you.

It's an honor, sir.

Yeah. Take care.

00:35:24.157 --> 00:35:27.127
So, I take it
this isn't a social call?

596
00:35:27.227 --> 00:35:28.663
I'm afraid not.

Hey. Here's some skim milk
for your skim-milk coffee.

I didn't check the label,
but I'm sure it's okay.

The Painter, sir.

602

Oh, I know who he is,
Agent Kim.

603
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:45.980
He's my kid, you see.

604
00:35:46.446 --> 00:35:49.182
I want to know when the last
time you spoke with him was.

605
00:35:49.282 --> 00:35:51.853
It's been years,
and you know it. What's up?

606
00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:55.455
Your boy murdered eight
federal agents in cold blood.

607
00:35:55.957 --> 00:35:57.290
What?

608
00:35:58.158 --> 00:35:59.326
Federal agents?

609
00:35:59.426 --> 00:36:00.828
They were there
to question him.

610
00:36:00.928 --> 00:36:02.396
You don't send a wet team in

611
00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:05.099
to question someone like Peter,
and you know that.

612
00:36:05.198 --> 00:36:06.400
And you didn't call me?

613
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.969
We have intel
he's in possession

614
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:09.537
of highly-sensitive material.

615
00:36:09.637 --> 00:36:11.773
He's a national security threat.

616
00:36:12.707 --> 00:36:13.908
How'd you find him?

617
00:36:14.008 --> 00:36:15.409
The question we should be asking

618
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.712
is why would your son steal
classified documents

619
00:36:17.812 --> 00:36:19.681
from the U.S. government?

620
00:36:19.781 --> 00:36:20.982
What's his motive?

621
00:36:21.082 --> 00:36:22.617
Is Peter being set up?

622
00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:24.384
Is the company
covering its tracks,

623
00:36:24.484 --> 00:36:26.353
and using you to do that?
Oh, no, sir.

624
00:36:26.453 --> 00:36:28.956
We are just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

625
00:36:29.724 --> 00:36:31.425
Do you know
where Peter would go,

626
00:36:31.526 --> 00:36:33.161
or what he would want
with this intel?

627
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.930
I don't know anything,
Agent Kim.

628
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.598

to the bottom of it.

for you both to leave.

00:41:59.286 --> 00:42:01.155
This is how I found you.

00:42:01.922 --> 00:42:03.257
[Elena] <i>What are you drawing?</i>

731
00:42:06.193 --> 00:42:07.928
[Peter] Something beautiful.

732
00:42:09.563 --> 00:42:10.931
[chuckles softly]

733
00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:13.067
Do I really look like that?

734
00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:15.803
That's what I see
every time I look at you.

735
00:42:17.838 --> 00:42:20.007
Do you recognize
her handwriting?

736
00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:30.584
I don't know why, but she
wanted me to be here with you.

740
00:43:08.557 --> 00:43:10.825
No offense,
but what were you thinking?

741
00:43:10.925 --> 00:43:14.061
Sending in a bunch of jarheads
to take out The Painter?

743
00:43:16.063 --> 00:43:18.632
Oh. They left quite a mess.
[sighs]

744
00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:21.570
Send in the cleaners.
Maybe they can find something.

745
00:43:21.669 --> 00:43:23.204
I can't.

746
00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:26.874
Did you know
he's an actual painter?

747
00:43:26.974 --> 00:43:29.376
Like, with fancy paints
and everything? It's not bad.

748
00:43:29.477 --> 00:43:31.679
Nice lines, good color.
Bit derivative.

749
00:43:31.779 --> 00:43:33.681
Not my taste, but...

750
00:43:33.781 --> 00:43:35.550
I always thought the name
was a metaphor, you know?

751
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:37.519
Like the artistry aspect?

752
00:43:37.618 --> 00:43:40.721
That he's so good,
he makes works of art...

753
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:42.256
but with killing people.
[line beeps]

754
00:43:42.356 --> 00:43:45.059

Why is the agency
trying to kill me?

761
00:44:41.815 --> 00:44:44.185
How about we start with,
"How you doing?"

762
00:44:44.285 --> 00:44:46.954
I haven't seen you in 17 years.
Cut the shit.

763
00:44:47.054 --> 00:44:50.724
I know you. You keep tabs
on everything and everyone,

764
00:44:50.824 --> 00:44:52.092
including me.

765
00:44:55.796 --> 00:44:57.364
What?
You gonna tell me

766
00:44:57.464 --> 00:44:59.033
Niles isn't your guy?

767
00:45:01.202 --> 00:45:03.837
You got me. You were
in a bad place when you left.

768
00:45:03.938 --> 00:45:06.273
Of course I was gonna
use our resources

769
00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:07.341
to keep an eye on you.

You got to know, Peter,

772
00:45:10.044 --> 00:45:12.980
I never meant for it
to go down the way it did.

773
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.583
If I could--
Just tell me about the people

774
00:45:14.683 --> 00:45:15.983
who came to kill me.

775
00:45:18.687 --> 00:45:21.755
There's an agent
named Naomi Piasecki.

776
00:45:22.489 --> 00:45:24.225
She's running things.
I never worked with her,

777
00:45:24.325 --> 00:45:28.495
but she has a reputation
for being rather ruthless.

778
00:45:28.597 --> 00:45:29.964
What does she want with me?

779
00:45:30.064 --> 00:45:31.533
[Byrne] From what I gather,
she thinks

780
00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:32.766
you're in possession
of something

781
00:45:32.866 --> 00:45:34.301
that poses a major threat

782
00:45:34.401 --> 00:45:35.903
to our national security.

783
00:45:36.003 --> 00:45:38.005
Is that true? Are you?

784
00:45:38.105 --> 00:45:39.240
No.

785
00:45:41.643 --> 00:45:45.547
Well, if Piasecki's throwing
this much firepower at you,

786
00:45:45.647 --> 00:45:47.448
it must be something serious.

787
00:45:50.552 --> 00:45:52.253

788
00:45:53.287 --> 00:45:54.656

I'm just happy to be with you.

790
00:45:57.692 --> 00:45:59.393
Who is Sophia,

791
00:45:59.493 --> 00:46:02.296
and why is she saying
that she's Elena's daughter?

792
00:46:04.298 --> 00:46:05.799

Peter...

794
00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.904
Elena couldn't have children
after the incident.

795
00:46:11.005 --> 00:46:13.240
Well, she looks
just like her...

796
00:46:14.074 --> 00:46:15.976
and she thinks I'm her father.

797
00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:20.515

Show me your fucking hands!

807
00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:26.880
Do you want to do this
in the dark,

808
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.982
or are you gonna
turn some lights on?

809
00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:31.686
I don't need lights
to blast you!

Sure. But, uh...

00:47:38.058 --> 00:47:39.661
you do need ammunition,

813
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:41.295

And who are you working for?

is September 30th, 1980,

can you shut up
and actually help?

to politicians.

I'm sorry, dear. She's gone.

How?

In service of her country.

he just vanished?

You're here because the men you
were with are wanted fugitives,

how you fit into that equation.

I am so sorry
about what happened.

Is that why you killed her?
Why would you say that?

1187
01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:13.207
Maybe because you sent
a bunch of assholes

1188
01:11:13.306 --> 01:11:14.542

Sophia, the CIA doesn't
want to kill you or Peter.

1194
01:11:30.224 --> 01:11:34.195
The goal was to bring him in
for questioning peacefully,

1195
01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:35.830
and he reacted with violence.

1196

ask questions later."

or have anything on him,

Let me remind you, withholding
a person's whereabouts

asking your opinion, Agent Kim.

They're recruiting kids.

They're stealing them, raising
them with agency parents.

1221

They're temporarily
blinding them

1222

so they over-develop
their other senses.

into you.

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.554
Of course.
Really?

1267
01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:22.656
Then what the fuck is this?

1268
01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:26.193
Fail.

1269
01:15:26.293 --> 01:15:27.528
[shouts]
Attention, everyone!

1270
01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:29.430
The Painter is incoming.

1271
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:33.000
I need eyes on him before he
steps foot into this facility.

1272
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.402
Am I clear?

1273
01:15:34.502 --> 01:15:36.137
Move!
[man] You heard her! Let's go!

1274
01:15:36.237 --> 01:15:39.340
Intercept teams, into position.
The Painter is coming in hot.

1275
01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.077
We are code red.
I repeat, code red.

1276
01:15:43.844 --> 01:15:45.980
[indistinct chatter over radios]

1277
01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:50.284
[keys clacking rapidly]
[indistinct conversations]

1278
01:15:51.786 --> 01:15:53.287
I'm gonna go over here.

1279
01:15:54.922 --> 01:15:56.223
[man] You heard her!
Let's go!

1280
01:15:57.258 --> 01:15:58.759
[both groan]

1281
01:15:58.993 --> 01:16:01.262
[Kim] Southwest corner. I need
teams on the southwest corner!

1282
01:16:01.362 --> 01:16:03.130
We are empty over there!

1283
01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:06.400
North is good.
We need the west side, though.

1284
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.635
West side, please.

1285
01:16:11.205 --> 01:16:14.642
All right. Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Move it!

1286
01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:17.611
Southwest corner! We need teams
on the southwest corner!

1287
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:19.814
[man] <i>Southwest corner! Move!</i>

1288
01:16:19.914 --> 01:16:21.882
[grunting]

1289
01:16:21.982 --> 01:16:24.151

1290

[breakers clicking]

1291
01:16:26.454 --> 01:16:29.123
[suspenseful music plays]

1292
01:16:29.223 --> 01:16:31.325
Perimeter around me. Now!

1293
01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:36.864
[man] You two, with me!
Defensive formation.

1294
01:16:37.631 --> 01:16:40.034
Hold! Hold your position!

1295
01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:57.017
[click]
[man] Heads up!

1296
01:16:57.118 --> 01:16:58.719
[explosion]

1297
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:03.558
[gunfire burst]
[man] We have a man down!

1298
01:17:03.657 --> 01:17:05.126
[rapid gunfire]

1299
01:17:05.226 --> 01:17:06.961
[indistinct yelling]

1300
01:17:11.899 --> 01:17:13.868
[man] Where is he?
[groans]

1301
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:16.437
Chief!

1302
01:17:16.538 --> 01:17:17.771
[trigger clicks]
Shit!

1303
01:17:17.872 --> 01:17:19.940
Move.
[gunfire continues]

1304
01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.109
[man] More down! Where is he?

1305
01:17:22.209 --> 01:17:23.844
Anyone got eyes on him?

1306
01:17:28.617 --> 01:17:30.651
[gunfire continues]

1307
01:17:48.269 --> 01:17:50.137
[rapid gunfire]

01:17:50.804 --> 01:17:53.741
[tense music plays]

1309
01:17:59.747 --> 01:18:01.916
[breathing heavily]

1310
01:18:02.651 --> 01:18:04.418
[footsteps approaching]

1311
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.289
We need to move you to
a more secure location, Sophia.

1312
01:18:08.389 --> 01:18:10.257
[gunfire in distance]
Why are you helping me?

1313
01:18:10.357 --> 01:18:13.260
The situation
has gotten out of control.

1314
01:18:14.962 --> 01:18:16.631
It is too dangerous
for you here.

1315
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:19.733
What about my dad?
Is he okay?

1316
01:18:24.838 --> 01:18:26.840
We need to go now.

1317
01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:29.043
[Sophia] Okay. Okay.

1318
01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:34.748
[man] Come on! Let's go. Go!

1319
01:18:40.487 --> 01:18:41.590
[man] Keep going! Eyes up!

1320
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:42.990
There's a weapon down here.

1321
01:18:46.093 --> 01:18:48.229
Watch your corners.
Move, move!

1322
01:18:48.329 --> 01:18:50.764
[both grunting]

1323
01:18:52.833 --> 01:18:54.768
[man groans]

1324

[groans]

1326
01:19:20.894 --> 01:19:22.763
[man] This way! Move!

1327
01:19:24.465 --> 01:19:26.100
[grunting]

1328
01:19:29.704 --> 01:19:31.972
[music ends abruptly]

1329
01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:43.585
And where do you think
you're going?

1330
01:19:43.685 --> 01:19:45.886
Moving her to a safer location.

1331
01:19:46.387 --> 01:19:48.322
[tense music playing]

1332
01:19:54.763 --> 01:19:56.297
Come with me.

1333
01:19:57.298 --> 01:19:58.799
Both of you.

1334
01:20:21.021 --> 01:20:23.390
[men groaning]

1335
01:20:24.793 --> 01:20:26.561

[tense music plays]

1339
01:20:47.181 --> 01:20:48.449
I'll take it from here.

1340
01:20:49.383 --> 01:20:51.619
[ears ringing]
[Kim] I can't let you do that.

1341
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.656
You're disregarding
a direct order from a superior.

1342
01:20:54.756 --> 01:20:56.323
Stand the fuck down, Agent Kim.

1343
01:20:56.423 --> 01:20:58.992
It's over, Piasecki!
This whole operation is over.

1344
01:20:59.093 --> 01:21:00.595
I am taking her in, and we can--

1345
01:21:00.695 --> 01:21:02.463
[gunshot echoes]

1346
01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:07.034

[body hits ground]

1348
01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.108
[pistol racks]
Move.

1349
01:21:26.954 --> 01:21:28.122
Come on, kid. Move.

1350
01:21:31.593 --> 01:21:32.926
Let her go.

1351
01:21:34.228 --> 01:21:35.129
Dad.

1352
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.100
[air whistles]

1353
01:21:41.301 --> 01:21:42.436
Painter!

1354
01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:44.004
Let's finish this.

1355
01:21:45.673 --> 01:21:47.241
[Sophia whispers] Dad.

1356
01:21:48.843 --> 01:21:51.378
[imitates gunshot] Really?
Come on. You're gonna shoot me?

1357
01:21:51.478 --> 01:21:54.014
That's so boring.
Let's play a game.

1358
01:21:54.114 --> 01:21:56.417
Who is the better intern?

1359
01:21:56.518 --> 01:21:57.918
Patient Zero...

1360
01:21:58.018 --> 01:21:59.319
or the new-and-improved?

1361
01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.988
I'm not here
for your milestones.

1362
01:22:01.088 --> 01:22:02.524
[rapid gunfire]

1363
01:22:07.695 --> 01:22:10.264
Really? You're gonna deprive me

1364
01:22:10.364 --> 01:22:13.400
of the opportunity to prove
that I'm better than you?

1365
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.970
That's... No, that's...
That's fair. That makes sense.

1366
01:22:17.906 --> 01:22:20.174
[suspenseful music plays]

1367
01:22:26.013 --> 01:22:27.314

1368
01:22:36.156 --> 01:22:38.292
[breathing heavily]

1369
01:22:39.092 --> 01:22:40.528
I don't want to do this, kid.

1370
01:22:40.628 --> 01:22:42.129
These people, they...

1371
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:45.667
kidnapped you, tortured you,
brainwashed you,

1372
01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:49.203
all to make you something
you were never supposed to be.

1373
01:22:49.303 --> 01:22:50.605
Me.

1374
01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:55.275
What's your real name?

1375
01:22:56.210 --> 01:22:59.346
It's... It's Daniel.

1376
01:22:59.446 --> 01:23:01.850
Well, it doesn't have
to go down like this, Daniel.

1377
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:03.818
You can go have a whole life.

1378
01:23:03.918 --> 01:23:05.452
Fall in love, have kids.

1379
01:23:05.553 --> 01:23:07.822
But you got to make
that choice for yourself.

1380
01:23:07.922 --> 01:23:09.490
That does sound nice.

1381
01:23:10.123 --> 01:23:11.992
[chuckles]

1382
01:23:13.126 --> 01:23:15.062
But I like who I am.

1383
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:17.599
So enough with the pity party.

1384
01:23:17.699 --> 01:23:19.166
And don't feel sorry for me.

1385
01:23:19.266 --> 01:23:22.002
Sure, the whole forced-blindness
thing kind of sucked,

1386
01:23:22.102 --> 01:23:23.872
but it made me special.

1387
01:23:23.972 --> 01:23:25.138
And for the record,

1388
01:23:25.239 --> 01:23:28.041
they didn't force me
to be like you.

1389
01:23:28.141 --> 01:23:29.511
[neck cracks]

1390
01:23:30.043 --> 01:23:31.111
They forced me to be better.

1391
01:23:31.211 --> 01:23:34.281
[suspenseful music intensifies]

1392
01:23:43.658 --> 01:23:45.593

Whoo!

1397
01:24:35.944 --> 01:24:37.477
Come on!

1398
01:24:37.579 --> 01:24:38.613
[exhales deeply]

1399
01:24:41.749 --> 01:24:45.218
You know, Elena had
more fight in her than you do.

1400
01:24:45.319 --> 01:24:47.655
She really
stuck her neck out there.

1401
01:24:48.355 --> 01:24:50.592
[intense music plays]

1402
01:24:52.026 --> 01:24:53.493

[panting]

1407
01:25:18.452 --> 01:25:22.422
[ears ringing]
[Naomi] Peter, come find us.

1408
01:25:25.893 --> 01:25:27.595
[Sophia] Dad!

1409
01:25:28.161 --> 01:25:29.864
Dad, please!

1410
01:25:32.432 --> 01:25:34.468
Dad, can you hear me?

1411
01:25:36.104 --> 01:25:37.772
[music fades]

1412
01:25:59.393 --> 01:26:01.461
[ears ringing]
[Naomi] What took you so long?

1413
01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:09.202
I've been waiting a long time
to meet you, Painter.

1414
01:26:11.204 --> 01:26:13.875
[suspenseful music plays]

1415
01:26:13.975 --> 01:26:16.844
You must be Naomi Piasecki.

1416
01:26:16.944 --> 01:26:19.781
Hmm. Byrne told you about me?

1417
01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:22.550
He said you were ruthless.

1418
01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:23.785
[laughing]

1419
01:26:23.885 --> 01:26:26.186
I'm a little more than that.

1420
01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:29.389
God, Byrne would never
shut up about you.

1421
01:26:29.489 --> 01:26:32.126
All those years I worked
for him, he'd go on and on,

1422
01:26:32.225 --> 01:26:33.961
how you were the best
that ever was,

1423
01:26:34.062 --> 01:26:35.495
and the best he ever saw.

1424
01:26:35.596 --> 01:26:38.198
Jesus Christ,
it made me want to puke.

1425
01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:46.908
What, you think
you're the only one

1426
01:26:47.008 --> 01:26:48.543
that knows how
to dodge a bullet?

1427
01:26:49.276 --> 01:26:50.511
You're an Intern.

1428
01:26:50.611 --> 01:26:53.981
I'm the Head Intern, see?

1429
01:26:54.082 --> 01:26:56.951
They used to call me Mimic.
Now they call me the boss.

1430
01:26:58.452 --> 01:26:59.721
[Sophia panting] Dad!

1431
01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.564
Toss the weapon, Peter.

1432
01:27:10.732 --> 01:27:11.999
Game's over.

1433
01:27:21.743 --> 01:27:23.410
You okay?

1434
01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.682
Now where's that flash drive?

1435
01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:32.385
[gunshots]

1436
01:27:34.387 --> 01:27:36.724
Put it down! Put it down!

1437
01:27:36.824 --> 01:27:37.792
Put it down!

1438
01:27:41.162 --> 01:27:42.930
Told you I had your six, son.

1439
01:27:45.967 --> 01:27:47.267
What are you doing, Peter?

1440
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:51.172
Piasecki isn't
running The Internship.

1441
01:27:51.271 --> 01:27:52.874
She works for you.

1442
01:27:52.974 --> 01:27:55.576
The Internship's yours.
