1
00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:53.213
Hey, hon. How you feeling?

2
00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.381
<i>I'm good, love.</i>

3
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.551
The little ninja,
however,

4
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.620
is kicking
the absolute piss out of me.

5
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.922
Seventeen bathroom trips
and counting.

6
00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:09.196
Well, maybe you two should
be home, and not, you know,

7
00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.699
on active assignment in...

8
00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.501
<i>An undisclosed location.</i>

9
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.637
I'm chained to the desk,
I swear.

10
00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.270
<i>One more week of surveillance</i>

11
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.940
<i>and we bag this asshole,</i>

12
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.842
<i>and then I'm back home,</i>

13
00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:22.309
in full mama mode.

14
00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.344
<i>I can't wait.</i>
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

15
00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.480
I wanted to hear your voice
before I go dark.

16
00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.220
<i>Where to now?</i>

17
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.956
"An undisclosed location."

18
00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:37.157
<i>Ha-ha. Touche.</i>

19
00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:40.061
<i>Peter?</i>

20
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.863
Love you so much.

21
00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:43.397
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

22
00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:48.235
You too, El.

23
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.837
Forever and ever.

24
00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:57.879
Hey, Pop.

25
00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.479
Ah, shit.

26
00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:04.351
Nice costume.

27
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.319
Mustache really suits you.

28
00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:09.023
I'll get the drop on you
one of these days.

29
00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:10.390
Don't hold your breath.

30
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.895
Hey. You like my Colgate smile?

31
00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:17.565
Here.

32
00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:19.934
Souvenir.

33
00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:22.737
No, thanks.

34
00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:24.438
Suit yourself.

35
00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.240
How's Elena?

36
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.376
As big as a house.
She says hi, by the way.

37
00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:32.279
I bet she's ready
for this part to be over with.

38
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:34.347
You taking some time off?

39
00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.084
Yeah. Just let me
ask my boss.

40
00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:38.218
Well, you know me.

41
00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.954
I'm a "mission first" guy.

42
00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.422
The bigger question is,

43
00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.391
are you ready to be a dad?

44
00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:48.228
Were you?

45
00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:51.199
Nope.

46
00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.201
Who could've been ready?

47
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.470
<i>No one believed</i>
<i>you'd ever recover, Peter.</i>

48
00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:58.606
<i>And when I saw you</i>
<i>lying in that bed,</i>

49
00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:01.709
<i>I knew, somehow,</i>
<i>that you would.</i>

50
00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:05.245
<i>But I loved your parents.</i>

51
00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:08.049
<i>I felt a responsibility to you</i>

52
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.017
<i>when they were taken down</i>

53
00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:11.552
<i>by the terrorist attack.</i>

54
00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:13.554
<i>And I believed</i>

55
00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:15.890
<i>you'd get your hearing back.</i>

56
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.257
<i>I insisted.</i>

57
00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.761
It's extremely rare.

58
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:22.262
The injury to his ears
has made them hypersensitive

59
00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:23.931
to the point of pain.

60
00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.871
So he can hear?

61
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:31.706
He can hear everything.

62
00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:34.709
In time,
he'll learn to filter out

63
00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.644
the different sounds
so he can function.

64
00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:40.581
It would be a terrible weakness
if he can't control it.

65
00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:42.482
Or a strength.

66
00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:46.921
<i>I refused</i>
<i>to believe the naysayers,</i>

67
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:48.355
<i>and look what happened.</i>

68
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.024
<i>You did get your hearing back,</i>

69
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:51.526
<i>and it became an asset.</i>

70
00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:54.427
It all hurts! Stop it!
Hey, it's me. It's okay.

71
00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.532
<i>You became</i>
<i>a kind of a wonder in our work.</i>

72
00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:02.203
It's okay. You're safe.

73
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.437
I can't take the place
of your father,

74
00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.107
but if you give me a chance,

75
00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:08.810
maybe we can make
a family of our own.

76
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.578
You know,
there's plenty of stuff

77
00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:13.114
I'd do over again,
if I had half the chance,

78
00:05:13.214 --> 00:05:17.450
but adopting you, helping you
become the man you've become...

79
00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:19.486
You're the best thing
I ever did.

80
00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:22.757
You're gonna be my legacy.

81
00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:32.133
He's as bad as they come.

82
00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:34.434
Government intel, weapons,

83
00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:38.573
corporate espionage,
drugs, you name it.

84
00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:40.942
The golden boy
of all our enemies.

85
00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:43.845
He's very well-protected, Peter.

86
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:46.180
A biometric watch?

87
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.649
Contains a hard drive
with sole access

88
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:51.919
to his contacts, stolen intel,
and the account numbers

89
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:53.453
of the hundreds of millions
he's made

90
00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.089
selling out our country.

91
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.324
We want it all back.

92
00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:57.625
You need to download
the contents

93
00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.492
while he's still breathing.

94
00:05:59.594 --> 00:06:01.963
It's linked to a heart monitor
in the watch.

95
00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:03.998
It stops,

96
00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:05.833
the data dies with him.

97
00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:07.268
Tricky.

98
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.003
That's why I have you, Peter.

99
00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.672
My fail-safe.

100
00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:12.840
My closer.

101
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.776
I'm sure you got
plenty of guys like me.

102
00:06:15.877 --> 00:06:17.044
Peter...

103
00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:19.780
there's nobody like you.

104
00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:24.318
He's meeting tonight

105
00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:27.688
with a Russian FSB,
and that can't happen.

106
00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:30.825
Tonight?
Right. Clock is ticking.

107
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:32.660
No matter the consequence.
Consequence,

108
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.862
No matter
the collateral damage...

109
00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.131
We complete our mission.

110
00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:39.133
Be careful, son.

111
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.568
Always, Pop.

112
00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:42.435
I learned from the best.

113
00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:21.395
Elena?

114
00:09:27.502 --> 00:09:29.003
Peter?

115
00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:31.906
It's okay. He's a friendly.

116
00:09:33.274 --> 00:09:34.543
Peter, you have to let him go.

117
00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:38.412
I have orders.
So do I.

118
00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:40.549
We've been building a case
on this guy for eight months.

119
00:09:40.648 --> 00:09:42.683
He needs to stand trial.

120
00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:08.075
No.

121
00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:09.410
Elena?

122
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.181
Peter!

123
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.183
Peter!

124
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.688
Peter...

125
00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:22.323
Peter! Peter...

126
00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:23.824
Peter!

127
00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:04.899
No!

128
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.702
That's my baby!

129
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:12.206
That's my...

130
00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:14.041
No! Get off me!

131
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.710
My life is falling apart
because of you,

132
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.312
because of every fucking lie
you've ever told me.

133
00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:19.514
Peter! Peter! Listen to me.

134
00:11:19.614 --> 00:11:21.081
She wasn't supposed to be there.

135
00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:23.117
I thought she was behind a desk,
running surveillance!

136
00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:25.386
You sat across from me
at that diner

137
00:11:25.486 --> 00:11:27.589
and you lied to me!
No, I did not.

138
00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:30.157
Please, don't let this
pull us apart.

139
00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:31.759
I'm done.

140
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.328
Peter...

141
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:38.933
<i>Peter!</i>
<i>No, we can't.</i>

142
00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:41.503
I can't have another baby.

143
00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:45.172
<i>And every time</i>
<i>I look at you...</i>

144
00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:47.642
I just can't.

145
00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:48.976
Elena.

146
00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.177
<i>Elena!</i>

147
00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:34.255
<i>Dennis.</i>

148
00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:35.923
Elena, one sec!

149
00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:43.732
Hey. I'm just going to go
and take this call.

150
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:45.833
I'll be right back, okay?

151
00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:47.935
Everything's
going to be okay.

152
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.609
Elena?

153
00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:56.043
I got the flash drive
you sent me.

154
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.345
The intel on this thing
is unbelievable.

155
00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.715
<i>There's 30 kids</i>
<i>part of this Internship.</i>

156
00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:01.849
<i>You need to go dark.</i>

157
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.284
<i>I can't believe the agency</i>

158
00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:05.019
<i>is capable of</i>
<i>anything like this.</i>

159
00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:06.920
You have no idea what
our agency is capable of.

160
00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:09.724
Poor kids. How's the boy?

161
00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:12.793
He's, uh... He's fine.

162
00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:14.428
<i>He knows I'll protect him.</i>

163
00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:15.829
But Marlene didn't make it.

164
00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:18.966
I'm so sorry, Dennis.

165
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:20.735
<i>Listen. I think</i>
<i>they might know where we are.</i>

166
00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:22.803
I need
those extraction coordinates.

167
00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:24.004
I'm working on
the coordinates now.

168
00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:25.906
<i>Just get out of the city.</i>

169
00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:27.875
Okay. Hurry. Hurry!

170
00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:35.849
Hey.

171
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:37.951
Hey, buddy. You lock the door?

172
00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:41.255
I need you to open the door.

173
00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:43.692
We can't be here.
We gotta go.

174
00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:45.159
Hey. Open the door.

175
00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:46.894
Come on! Open the door!
We gotta go!

176
00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.196
We gotta go!
Open the door! Now!

177
00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:50.497
Open the door!

178
00:14:37.846 --> 00:14:39.480
Did you find the drive?

179
00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:42.550
I heard him
talking on the phone.

180
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.853
He sent it to somebody else.

181
00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:46.788
Who?

182
00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.322
I only heard a first name:

183
00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.290
"Elena."

184
00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:57.799
Check it.
The beat absolutely kills.

185
00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:32.634
Lucy?

186
00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:34.935
Mark. Guess what?

187
00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:37.237
We sold
one of your paintings.

188
00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:38.305
Really?

189
00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:40.474
<i>Uh-huh. I've got cash for you.</i>

190
00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:42.142
Come by tonight.

191
00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:43.578
I'll make it
worth your while.

192
00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:47.481
<i>Oh, come on. Live a little.</i>

193
00:15:47.582 --> 00:15:48.783
I live.

194
00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:50.451
Yeah, quietly.

195
00:15:50.552 --> 00:15:52.319
Ah, you say that
like it's a bad thing.

196
00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:54.455
<i>There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with quiet, Mark,</i>

197
00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:57.157
but sometimes, it is nice
to actually go out

198
00:15:57.257 --> 00:16:01.128
into the rest of the world
instead of hiding at home.

199
00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:02.996
<i>So...</i>

200
00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.032
what do you say?

201
00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:09.136
Yeah, all right.

202
00:16:10.672 --> 00:16:12.039
Great.

203
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.007
I'll see you later, then.

204
00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:26.581
<i>I almost forgot.</i>

205
00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:29.416
Happy birthday, Peter!

206
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.159
You gotta stop doing this.

207
00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.228
You're paying twice as much
money for everything.

208
00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:43.196
You're the one
that's always getting paint

209
00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:44.966
all over all of your stuff.

210
00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:48.036
I've been with you long enough
to appreciate the value of...

211
00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:50.170
...critical redundancy.

212
00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:53.041
One of the few things
I learned from my boss:

213
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.509
always have a back-up.

214
00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:57.244
But...

215
00:17:57.344 --> 00:17:59.379
there is only one you.

216
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:56.938
<i>Dear Peter:</i>

217
00:18:57.038 --> 00:18:58.372
<i>The hardest thing to see</i>

218
00:18:58.472 --> 00:19:00.775
<i>is what is in front</i>
<i>of your eyes.</i>

219
00:19:01.643 --> 00:19:02.777
<i>El.</i>

220
00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:01.969
Hey, Mark.

221
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.504
Niles.

222
00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:22.255
Junk Man.

223
00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:24.458
Hey, Mark.

224
00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:27.327
I've got your six, man.
I've got your six.

225
00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:29.296
Hey! Back, back!

226
00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:30.765
What brings you to town?

227
00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:33.601
The usual!
Preparing for the apocalypse.

228
00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:35.970
I got my pacemaker,
it's all tuned up. All tuned up.

229
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.405
Besides that, minding
my own business. How about you?

230
00:20:38.506 --> 00:20:41.274
Same. Minding mine.
Ah. Smart.

231
00:20:41.374 --> 00:20:42.877
I got your six, man!

232
00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:44.579
To the end, soldier.

233
00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:48.883
Okay. To the end! Okay!
Those fools.

234
00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:07.034
Which one?

235
00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:08.703
The three dogs.

236
00:21:08.803 --> 00:21:09.971
"Wolves."

237
00:21:10.071 --> 00:21:11.072
Whatever.

238
00:21:11.172 --> 00:21:12.472
It's a hundred bucks.

239
00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.709
What's on the docket tonight?

240
00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:16.611
Ah. Just one beer,
then I gotta get home.

241
00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:19.514
God, your life
is so exciting, Mark.

242
00:21:19.614 --> 00:21:22.083
I don't know
how you stand it.

243
00:21:22.183 --> 00:21:24.685
Come on, hang out.
Have two beers.

244
00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:27.387
They're on the house,
and guess what?

245
00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.624
You might even enjoy yourself.

246
00:21:30.558 --> 00:21:33.060
You're a hard person
to say no to, Lucy.

247
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.529
Uh-huh.

248
00:21:34.629 --> 00:21:37.165
Stick around till closing...

249
00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:38.733
see if that's really true.

250
00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:41.401
Hey, Lucy!
Can I get a frickin' beer here?

251
00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:43.504
Hold your horses, Al!
I'm coming.

252
00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:46.373
Think about it.

253
00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:54.282
One of these days,
I'm gonna buy a painting, Mark.

254
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:56.851
Just you wait and see.
Early night?

255
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:59.386
Yeah. The computers
aren't gonna fix themselves.

256
00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:01.155
Night, my friend.

257
00:22:01.589 --> 00:22:03.356
Good night, fellas.

258
00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:39.560
Peter Barrett?

259
00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:44.098
Excuse me?

260
00:22:44.198 --> 00:22:45.733
My name is Sophia...

261
00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:48.502
and my mom
called you Peter.

262
00:22:48.603 --> 00:22:50.137
Who's your mother?

263
00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:52.573
Elena Maran.

264
00:22:57.078 --> 00:22:58.346
I'm sorry. I don't know her.

265
00:22:58.445 --> 00:22:59.780
Look, my mom said

266
00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:01.282
if anything
ever happened to her,

267
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:03.851
to drop everything
and find you.

268
00:23:03.951 --> 00:23:05.086
"Find Peter."

269
00:23:06.187 --> 00:23:07.355
Well, then I suggest

270
00:23:07.454 --> 00:23:09.824
you keep looking
till you find him.

271
00:23:12.526 --> 00:23:14.427
I bought your painting.

272
00:23:14.528 --> 00:23:16.664
She said
you were an artist.

273
00:23:18.532 --> 00:23:20.400
Sophia, is it?

274
00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:23.104
I'm sorry to hear
your mom left--

275
00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:25.106
She didn't leave.

276
00:23:25.206 --> 00:23:27.541
Something happened to her.

277
00:23:28.576 --> 00:23:30.011
My mom would
never leave me.

278
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:32.280
Listen, I can't help you.
Maybe try the police.

279
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.348
She wanted me to find you.

280
00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:38.386
No, she wanted you to find
someone named Peter.

281
00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:39.387
My name's Mark.

282
00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:41.789
I wish I could be more help.

283
00:23:41.889 --> 00:23:43.124
Good luck.

284
00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:48.729
Is everything okay?

285
00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.032
Ah, yeah.
Just a little misunderstanding.

286
00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:53.701
Thanks, Lucy.

287
00:23:53.801 --> 00:23:57.004
What? You're leaving?
Yeah. Good night.

288
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.108
Good night, Mark.

289
00:24:03.911 --> 00:24:05.012
Fuck.

290
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.982
You okay, hon?

291
00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:09.550
I'm fine.

292
00:24:10.685 --> 00:24:12.753
I guess
I should call a cab.

293
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.526
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?

294
00:24:21.494 --> 00:24:22.897
It's dead.

295
00:24:23.731 --> 00:24:25.900
I'll call you a cab.

296
00:25:12.613 --> 00:25:15.016
You stalking me?
Holy shit!

297
00:25:16.283 --> 00:25:17.818
Sneak up on people much?

298
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.121
How'd you find me?

299
00:25:27.495 --> 00:25:29.196
I saw your license plate
in the parking lot.

300
00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:32.166
My mom's CIA. She taught me
how to impersonate a cop.

301
00:25:32.266 --> 00:25:34.535
I just called the DMV
and asked for your info.

302
00:25:34.635 --> 00:25:35.803
Really?

303
00:25:37.004 --> 00:25:39.540
No, not really.
Lucy told me where you live.

304
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.409
But my mom did teach me,
if I ever needed to,

305
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.945
but I didn't even need to,
because, you know... Well, Lucy.

306
00:25:46.113 --> 00:25:48.783
She's really pretty,
by the way. Are you guys...

307
00:25:48.883 --> 00:25:50.184
together?

308
00:25:51.052 --> 00:25:53.921
Like I said, I can't help you,
so if you don't mind.

309
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:57.725
You were CIA
like my mom, right?

310
00:26:00.127 --> 00:26:02.696
I am truly sorry
for what you're going through,

311
00:26:02.797 --> 00:26:05.166
but I am not
the guy you're looking for.

312
00:26:06.033 --> 00:26:08.602
There has to be a reason
that she sent me here.

313
00:26:08.702 --> 00:26:10.805
Well, she made a mistake.

314
00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:12.773
My name's Mark Nicholson,

315
00:26:12.873 --> 00:26:16.577
so you need to call the cops,
or the CIA, whoever.

316
00:26:16.677 --> 00:26:18.012
Someone who can actually help.

317
00:26:18.112 --> 00:26:20.047
Oh. Yeah.

318
00:26:20.948 --> 00:26:23.984
Can I at least
borrow a charger?

319
00:26:39.133 --> 00:26:40.201
Wow.

320
00:26:40.935 --> 00:26:42.837
You painted all of these?

321
00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:48.676
They're super cool.
Very... Van Gogh.

322
00:26:52.113 --> 00:26:54.315
I have that charger
around here somewhere.

323
00:27:02.823 --> 00:27:04.892
You're a really good painter.

324
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.629
Oh, hey, kid. Stop.
Those are private.

325
00:27:13.067 --> 00:27:14.368
This is her.

326
00:27:15.102 --> 00:27:16.804
This is my mom!

327
00:27:16.904 --> 00:27:18.873
So you do know her.

328
00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:21.208
Why would you lie?

329
00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:23.677
This is my mother.

330
00:27:27.648 --> 00:27:29.049
And you're my father.

331
00:27:30.284 --> 00:27:31.152
What?

332
00:27:31.252 --> 00:27:32.621
You heard me.

333
00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:43.864
Go upstairs.

334
00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:45.766
Last door on the left's
the bathroom.

335
00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:47.201
Lock the door
and get in the tub.

336
00:27:50.704 --> 00:27:52.806
No. No. No fucking way.
Now!

337
00:27:52.907 --> 00:27:56.076
What? What do you mean "now"?
What's happening?

338
00:27:56.443 --> 00:27:57.678
Move, move!

339
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.414
Upstairs. Now.
What's happening?

340
00:28:28.577 --> 00:28:30.010
Move, move!

341
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.017
Get back!

342
00:28:40.754 --> 00:28:41.789
Move, move, move!

343
00:28:44.693 --> 00:28:46.160
Cover, cover!

344
00:29:02.843 --> 00:29:04.144
Hey, go, go!

345
00:29:07.414 --> 00:29:08.550
Go, go!

346
00:29:21.028 --> 00:29:22.229
Ah!

347
00:29:44.318 --> 00:29:47.321
Watch the stairs!
Go, go, go!

348
00:29:47.689 --> 00:29:49.189
Move, move!

349
00:30:54.021 --> 00:30:56.490
It's okay. It's okay.

350
00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:58.660
No, no, no, no, no.
I... I...

351
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.161
No. You did the right thing.
They were here to kill me.

352
00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:03.130
What if they were here for me?
There's probably more coming!

353
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.799
There's no one else out there!

354
00:31:04.898 --> 00:31:07.000
Sophia! I promise.

355
00:31:07.101 --> 00:31:09.269
There's no one else out there.

356
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:24.318
You are Peter Barrett.

357
00:31:26.387 --> 00:31:27.789
It doesn't matter.

358
00:31:27.921 --> 00:31:29.591
We need to get you safe.

359
00:31:29.691 --> 00:31:32.960
I think I know someone
that might be able to help us.

360
00:32:02.657 --> 00:32:05.292
Yeah. Totally not CIA.

361
00:32:05.392 --> 00:32:06.326
Let's go.

362
00:32:52.574 --> 00:32:54.642
Chief? You wanted to see me?

363
00:32:54.742 --> 00:32:55.944
Come in.

364
00:32:56.043 --> 00:32:57.779
What do you know
about Peter Barrett?

365
00:32:57.879 --> 00:32:59.581
Peter Barrett?

366
00:33:02.917 --> 00:33:04.384
The Painter?

367
00:33:04.485 --> 00:33:06.153
The one and only.

368
00:33:06.888 --> 00:33:08.489
He just went rogue.

369
00:33:09.223 --> 00:33:10.592
There he goes, and...

370
00:33:10.692 --> 00:33:11.759
...bang.

371
00:33:13.661 --> 00:33:15.128
Jesus.

372
00:33:16.798 --> 00:33:19.534
I thought he went off-grid
years ago. Retired.

373
00:33:19.634 --> 00:33:22.871
Well, the eight dead federal
agents would say otherwise.

374
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:24.238
Why now,
after all this time?

375
00:33:24.338 --> 00:33:25.974
He's suspected
of being in possession

376
00:33:26.073 --> 00:33:27.274
of classified materials,

377
00:33:27.374 --> 00:33:29.443
making him
a national security threat.

378
00:33:29.544 --> 00:33:32.246
Send in a containment perimeter
around Cascade.

379
00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:34.516
The Painter
just became priority one.

380
00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:35.750
Copy that, ma'am.

381
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.417
Oh, chief.
Does the old man know?

382
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:41.488
He's about to.
And we're gonna do the honors.

383
00:33:42.824 --> 00:33:44.157
Dismissed.

384
00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.250
It's about time.

385
00:34:41.381 --> 00:34:44.018
Well, it's always good
to spend time with you,

386
00:34:44.117 --> 00:34:45.385
face-to-face.

387
00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:47.254
But we never got
the resources, did we?

388
00:34:47.354 --> 00:34:49.389
Well, there's always
funds available.

389
00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:51.291
Just depends
on where you find it.

390
00:34:51.391 --> 00:34:53.493
Oh, yes. You and I
know a lot about that.

391
00:34:53.595 --> 00:34:54.896
Yes, sir.

392
00:34:54.996 --> 00:34:57.130
W-we'll have
to pick this up later.

393
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.099
Let's do that.

394
00:35:02.804 --> 00:35:03.671
Naomi.

395
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:04.606
Good afternoon.

396
00:35:04.706 --> 00:35:05.773
This is Agent Kim.

397
00:35:05.873 --> 00:35:07.274
Come on in.
Good to see you.

398
00:35:07.374 --> 00:35:08.275
It's an honor, sir.

399
00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:09.744
This is Senator Reaves.

400
00:35:09.844 --> 00:35:11.411
Ladies.
Hi.

401
00:35:11.512 --> 00:35:13.615
Go easy on him.
I need him alive.

402
00:35:13.715 --> 00:35:15.415
Especially for next week's vote.

403
00:35:15.516 --> 00:35:17.351
Okay, kid.
Good. Thanks for your support.

404
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.621
Yeah. Take care.
Cheers.

405
00:35:24.157 --> 00:35:27.127
So, I take it
this isn't a social call?

406
00:35:27.227 --> 00:35:28.663
I'm afraid not.

407
00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:33.200
Hey. Here's some skim milk
for your skim-milk coffee.

408
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.302
I didn't check the label,
but I'm sure it's okay.

409
00:35:35.402 --> 00:35:37.538
When's the last time you were
in touch with Peter Barrett?

410
00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:40.108
Peter Barrett?

411
00:35:40.207 --> 00:35:41.308
The Painter, sir.

412
00:35:41.408 --> 00:35:44.211
Oh, I know who he is,
Agent Kim.

413
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:45.980
He's my kid, you see.

414
00:35:46.446 --> 00:35:49.182
I want to know when the last
time you spoke with him was.

415
00:35:49.282 --> 00:35:51.853
It's been years,
and you know it. What's up?

416
00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:55.455
Your boy murdered eight
federal agents in cold blood.

417
00:35:55.957 --> 00:35:57.290
What?

418
00:35:58.158 --> 00:35:59.326
Federal agents?

419
00:35:59.426 --> 00:36:00.828
They were there
to question him.

420
00:36:00.928 --> 00:36:02.396
You don't send a wet team in

421
00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:05.099
to question someone like Peter,
and you know that.

422
00:36:05.198 --> 00:36:06.400
And you didn't call me?

423
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.969
We have intel
he's in possession

424
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:09.537
of highly-sensitive material.

425
00:36:09.637 --> 00:36:11.773
He's a national security threat.

426
00:36:12.707 --> 00:36:13.908
How'd you find him?

427
00:36:14.008 --> 00:36:15.409
The question we should be asking

428
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.712
is why would your son steal
classified documents

429
00:36:17.812 --> 00:36:19.681
from the U.S. government?

430
00:36:19.781 --> 00:36:20.982
What's his motive?

431
00:36:21.082 --> 00:36:22.617
Is Peter being set up?

432
00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:24.384
Is the company
covering its tracks,

433
00:36:24.484 --> 00:36:26.353
and using you to do that?
Oh, no, sir.

434
00:36:26.453 --> 00:36:28.956
We are just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

435
00:36:29.724 --> 00:36:31.425
Do you know
where Peter would go,

436
00:36:31.526 --> 00:36:33.161
or what he would want
with this intel?

437
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.930
I don't know anything,
Agent Kim.

438
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.598
But I'll get
to the bottom of it.

439
00:36:37.699 --> 00:36:39.967
<i>I'll</i> get to the bottom of it.

440
00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:44.939
And now it's time
for you both to leave.

441
00:36:48.275 --> 00:36:49.510
He's hiding something.

442
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.311
Chief?
Put a tap and tail on Byrne.

443
00:36:51.411 --> 00:36:54.247
I want to know where he goes
and who he talks to.

444
00:36:54.949 --> 00:36:56.249
Ma'am.

445
00:37:08.361 --> 00:37:10.631
We're hiding out
at a computer shop?

446
00:37:14.836 --> 00:37:16.403
Let's go.

447
00:37:29.784 --> 00:37:30.952
Niles?

448
00:37:31.052 --> 00:37:32.486
Niles!

449
00:37:34.722 --> 00:37:36.456
Mark, my friend.

450
00:37:36.557 --> 00:37:38.391
Huh.
I need your help.

451
00:37:38.492 --> 00:37:40.528
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Of course. What do you need?

452
00:37:40.628 --> 00:37:42.462
You're good
with computers, right?

453
00:37:44.532 --> 00:37:46.299
I mean, you can hack?

454
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:47.902
I don't-- I don't know
what you're talking about,

455
00:37:48.002 --> 00:37:49.402
because that is, uh, illegal.

456
00:37:49.504 --> 00:37:51.404
I run a legitimate business.
Whoa, whoa!

457
00:37:51.506 --> 00:37:53.141
I'm short on patience, Niles.

458
00:37:53.241 --> 00:37:54.575
A wet team
just tried to take us out,

459
00:37:54.675 --> 00:37:56.544
and I need to figure out
what's going on,

460
00:37:56.644 --> 00:38:00.014
so I need you to hack
the CIA network. Now.

461
00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:02.150
W-what? Hack the CIA?

462
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.785
W-what makes you think
I can do that?

463
00:38:03.885 --> 00:38:05.520
Call it a hunch.

464
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.026
Fine.

465
00:38:12.126 --> 00:38:13.493
Follow me.

466
00:38:15.395 --> 00:38:16.631
Come on.

467
00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:20.300
Ran it through their system.

468
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.669
Usually,
there's some kind of chatter,

469
00:38:21.769 --> 00:38:23.336
but nobody on
the international side

470
00:38:23.436 --> 00:38:26.707
knows anything
about a kill-or-capture order.

471
00:38:26.808 --> 00:38:27.809
What about my mom?

472
00:38:32.213 --> 00:38:34.414
Nothing.
She comes up active,

473
00:38:34.515 --> 00:38:36.349
on assignment, gone dark.

474
00:38:38.019 --> 00:38:39.419
If something happened to her,

475
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.289
it's higher up on the food chain
than I can go.

476
00:38:41.421 --> 00:38:42.757
Well, is there anything else?

477
00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:44.258
Yeah.

478
00:38:44.357 --> 00:38:47.427
The name "Peter Barrett"
you gave me...

479
00:38:47.528 --> 00:38:49.197
comes up classified.

480
00:38:49.297 --> 00:38:50.798
Though, however,
there is the name

481
00:38:50.898 --> 00:38:54.367
of his superior here,
a Henry Byrne.

482
00:39:07.715 --> 00:39:08.983
Byrne.

483
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:12.653
It's me.

484
00:39:14.822 --> 00:39:16.023
Peter?

485
00:39:16.824 --> 00:39:19.627
A CIA wet team
just tried to kill me.

486
00:39:20.194 --> 00:39:21.929
<i>Where are you?</i>

487
00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:24.497
Can I trust you?

488
00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:26.433
<i>Listen to me</i>
<i>carefully, Peter.</i>

489
00:39:26.534 --> 00:39:29.436
Two agents showed up
at my doorstep today,

490
00:39:29.537 --> 00:39:31.471
asking about you.

491
00:39:31.572 --> 00:39:34.374
I'm the only one
who can protect you.

492
00:39:35.543 --> 00:39:39.347
<i>The industrial park,</i>
<i>five miles north of Cascade.</i>

493
00:39:39.446 --> 00:39:41.182
<i>Come alone.</i>
<i>Text this number.</i>

494
00:39:41.282 --> 00:39:42.783
I'll come to you.

495
00:40:03.337 --> 00:40:04.739
It's me.

496
00:40:19.153 --> 00:40:20.420
What?

497
00:40:21.222 --> 00:40:22.757
You just, uh...

498
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:25.458
Nothing.

499
00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:27.295
Why couldn't you
just tell me the truth?

500
00:40:27.395 --> 00:40:28.829
It's complicated.

501
00:40:38.438 --> 00:40:39.472
Chief?

502
00:40:39.573 --> 00:40:40.641
What have you got?

503
00:40:40.741 --> 00:40:42.310
An unlicensed agency terminal

504
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.713
just went live in Cascade,
Oregon, and searched the network

505
00:40:45.813 --> 00:40:49.283
for keywords "Peter Barrett,"
"Elena," and "Sophia Maran."

506
00:40:49.383 --> 00:40:51.352
He's still there.

507
00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:52.787
Good job, Agent Kim.

508
00:40:52.887 --> 00:40:54.989
Get workups on everyone.
Lock down that intel.

509
00:40:55.089 --> 00:40:56.157
We're airborne in 90.

510
00:40:57.425 --> 00:40:59.627
Nobody finds out
who Peter is looking for.

511
00:40:59.727 --> 00:41:02.462
Am I clear?
Ma'am.

512
00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:08.402
Look. Take this.

513
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.938
If we get separated,
I'll be able to find you.

514
00:41:21.615 --> 00:41:23.384
What'd you find out?

515
00:41:23.483 --> 00:41:24.986
Nothing yet.
He's coming here.

516
00:41:25.453 --> 00:41:27.888
Why?
We need to find my mother.

517
00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:30.191
Byrne is our best chance
to do that.

518
00:41:33.493 --> 00:41:36.530
I never knew anything
about my father.

519
00:41:38.532 --> 00:41:39.967
Not until a week ago,

520
00:41:40.067 --> 00:41:41.602
when she told me
to come find you

521
00:41:41.702 --> 00:41:43.537
if I was ever in trouble.

522
00:41:48.075 --> 00:41:49.744
I can't be your father.

523
00:41:59.286 --> 00:42:01.155
This is how I found you.

524
00:42:01.922 --> 00:42:03.257
<i>What are you drawing?</i>

525
00:42:06.193 --> 00:42:07.928
Something beautiful.

526
00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:13.067
Do I really look like that?

527
00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:15.803
That's what I see
every time I look at you.

528
00:42:17.838 --> 00:42:20.007
Do you recognize
her handwriting?

529
00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:30.584
I don't know why, but she
wanted me to be here with you.

530
00:43:08.557 --> 00:43:10.825
No offense,
but what were you thinking?

531
00:43:10.925 --> 00:43:14.061
Sending in a bunch of jarheads
to take out The Painter?

532
00:43:16.063 --> 00:43:18.632
Oh. They left quite a mess.

533
00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:21.570
Send in the cleaners.
Maybe they can find something.

534
00:43:21.669 --> 00:43:23.204
I can't.

535
00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:26.874
Did you know
he's an actual painter?

536
00:43:26.974 --> 00:43:29.376
Like, with fancy paints
and everything? It's not bad.

537
00:43:29.477 --> 00:43:31.679
Nice lines, good color.
Bit derivative.

538
00:43:31.779 --> 00:43:33.681
Not my taste, but...

539
00:43:33.781 --> 00:43:35.550
I always thought the name
was a metaphor, you know?

540
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:37.519
Like the artistry aspect?

541
00:43:37.618 --> 00:43:40.721
That he's so good,
he makes works of art...

542
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:42.256
but with killing people.

543
00:43:42.356 --> 00:43:45.059
Hello? Hello? Okay. Well...

544
00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:47.695
fuck me, I guess.

545
00:44:32.039 --> 00:44:33.307
Peter.

546
00:44:40.047 --> 00:44:41.715
Why is the agency
trying to kill me?

547
00:44:41.815 --> 00:44:44.185
How about we start with,
"How you doing?"

548
00:44:44.285 --> 00:44:46.954
I haven't seen you in 17 years.
Cut the shit.

549
00:44:47.054 --> 00:44:50.724
I know you. You keep tabs
on everything and everyone,

550
00:44:50.824 --> 00:44:52.092
including me.

551
00:44:55.796 --> 00:44:57.364
What?
You gonna tell me

552
00:44:57.464 --> 00:44:59.033
Niles isn't your guy?

553
00:45:01.202 --> 00:45:03.837
You got me. You were
in a bad place when you left.

554
00:45:03.938 --> 00:45:06.273
Of course I was gonna
use our resources

555
00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:07.341
to keep an eye on you.

556
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:08.442
What father wouldn't?

557
00:45:08.543 --> 00:45:09.944
You got to know, Peter,

558
00:45:10.044 --> 00:45:12.980
I never meant for it
to go down the way it did.

559
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.583
If I could--
Just tell me about the people

560
00:45:14.683 --> 00:45:15.983
who came to kill me.

561
00:45:18.687 --> 00:45:21.755
There's an agent
named Naomi Piasecki.

562
00:45:22.489 --> 00:45:24.225
She's running things.
I never worked with her,

563
00:45:24.325 --> 00:45:28.495
but she has a reputation
for being rather ruthless.

564
00:45:28.597 --> 00:45:29.964
What does she want with me?

565
00:45:30.064 --> 00:45:31.533
From what I gather,
she thinks

566
00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:32.766
you're in possession
of something

567
00:45:32.866 --> 00:45:34.301
that poses a major threat

568
00:45:34.401 --> 00:45:35.903
to our national security.

569
00:45:36.003 --> 00:45:38.005
Is that true? Are you?

570
00:45:38.105 --> 00:45:39.240
No.

571
00:45:41.643 --> 00:45:45.547
Well, if Piasecki's throwing
this much firepower at you,

572
00:45:45.647 --> 00:45:47.448
it must be something serious.

573
00:45:50.552 --> 00:45:52.253
I have another question.

574
00:45:53.287 --> 00:45:54.656
Fire away.

575
00:45:54.755 --> 00:45:56.790
I'm just happy to be with you.

576
00:45:57.692 --> 00:45:59.393
Who is Sophia,

577
00:45:59.493 --> 00:46:02.296
and why is she saying
that she's Elena's daughter?

578
00:46:04.298 --> 00:46:05.799
Elena's daughter?

579
00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:07.434
Peter...

580
00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.904
Elena couldn't have children
after the incident.

581
00:46:11.005 --> 00:46:13.240
Well, she looks
just like her...

582
00:46:14.074 --> 00:46:15.976
and she thinks I'm her father.

583
00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:20.515
You're being played, son.

584
00:46:23.951 --> 00:46:25.819
You're being played.

585
00:47:07.796 --> 00:47:10.097
What the fuck
are you doing in my bar?

586
00:47:13.967 --> 00:47:15.202
Stand up!

587
00:47:20.675 --> 00:47:23.043
Show me your fucking hands!

588
00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:26.880
Do you want to do this
in the dark,

589
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.982
or are you gonna
turn some lights on?

590
00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:31.686
I don't need lights
to blast you!

591
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.356
Sure. But, uh...

592
00:47:38.058 --> 00:47:39.661
you do need ammunition,

593
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:41.295
and I have yours.

594
00:47:48.869 --> 00:47:50.404
Whoo!

595
00:47:57.712 --> 00:48:00.447
Ouch!
That sounds like it's broken.

596
00:48:01.048 --> 00:48:02.116
What do you want?

597
00:48:02.216 --> 00:48:05.486
I am looking for someone.

598
00:48:06.554 --> 00:48:08.122
An artistic type.

599
00:48:09.056 --> 00:48:09.990
No idea, buddy.

600
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.059
Oh, I think you do.

601
00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:14.529
See, I was up at his house,

602
00:48:14.629 --> 00:48:16.363
paying him a visit.

603
00:48:17.398 --> 00:48:19.701
He was out,
so I thought I'd come check

604
00:48:19.801 --> 00:48:21.935
his local watering hole,

605
00:48:22.035 --> 00:48:23.505
see what turns up.

606
00:48:25.973 --> 00:48:27.241
Fuck you, asshole!

607
00:48:36.684 --> 00:48:39.153
You need to think about what
comes out of your mouth next.

608
00:48:54.368 --> 00:48:57.772
Hello.
I'm supposedly your grandfather.

609
00:48:58.305 --> 00:49:01.074
Yeah. We can 23andMe
each other later.

610
00:49:01.175 --> 00:49:02.209
Where's my mom?

611
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:04.512
Who are you really,
young lady?

612
00:49:04.612 --> 00:49:05.613
And who are you working for?

613
00:49:05.713 --> 00:49:07.314
Put the gun down.

614
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:09.684
Put the gun down.

615
00:49:09.784 --> 00:49:10.951
I just want to find my mom.

616
00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:12.921
Elena's your mom? Okay!

617
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.355
When's her birthday?
What color are her eyes?

618
00:49:15.456 --> 00:49:17.592
What's her middle name?
Where did you live with her?

619
00:49:17.692 --> 00:49:20.628
What's your angle, Sophia?
If that's even your real name.

620
00:49:20.728 --> 00:49:22.329
And what do you want
with my son?

621
00:49:22.429 --> 00:49:27.201
My name is Sophia Elle Maran,
born October 23rd, 2006.

622
00:49:27.301 --> 00:49:31.205
My mom is Elena Tatiana Maran,
but everybody calls her El.

623
00:49:31.305 --> 00:49:33.775
Her birthday
is September 30th, 1980,

624
00:49:33.875 --> 00:49:35.476
and her eyes are brown.

625
00:49:35.577 --> 00:49:39.413
We live in Seattle,
at 5470 Crescent Lane,

626
00:49:39.514 --> 00:49:42.282
in a shitty
two-bedroom apartment.

627
00:49:42.382 --> 00:49:44.886
She works for the CIA,
in surveillance,

628
00:49:44.985 --> 00:49:46.386
and was gone
most of my childhood.

629
00:49:46.487 --> 00:49:48.489
I stayed
at our neighbor's house,

630
00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.357
with her best friend,
Janine Whittler,

631
00:49:50.457 --> 00:49:52.861
and her son, Steven,
who was my first kiss.

632
00:49:53.628 --> 00:49:55.830
She has a tattoo
on the inside of her wrist

633
00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:57.665
that says "Miracle."

634
00:49:57.765 --> 00:49:59.968
Bet you didn't know that.

635
00:50:00.067 --> 00:50:02.770
So if you're done
asking your stupid questions,

636
00:50:02.871 --> 00:50:05.372
can you shut up
and actually help?

637
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.643
What do you want me to do?

638
00:50:08.743 --> 00:50:10.210
Make a call.
See what you find.

639
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:13.280
I'm the nearest thing
to retired, Peter.

640
00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.917
I work out of the house,
reading case files

641
00:50:16.016 --> 00:50:18.185
and offering advice
to politicians.

642
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:22.690
I'll see what I can do.

643
00:50:28.863 --> 00:50:31.398
This is Operator G...

644
00:50:31.498 --> 00:50:32.767
2418.

645
00:50:32.867 --> 00:50:35.102
Access code "Typhoon."

646
00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:40.575
I need a status check
on an active agent:

647
00:50:40.675 --> 00:50:42.010
Elena Maran.

648
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:43.645
M-A-R-A-N.

649
00:50:45.379 --> 00:50:48.048
Special Activities.
That's right.

650
00:50:51.385 --> 00:50:52.587
I see.

651
00:50:53.855 --> 00:50:55.690
And next of kin?

652
00:51:01.361 --> 00:51:03.731
What? What happened?

653
00:51:09.971 --> 00:51:12.439
I'm sorry, dear. She's gone.

654
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.074
How?

655
00:51:14.742 --> 00:51:15.843
What do you mean, gone?

656
00:51:15.944 --> 00:51:17.745
In service of her country.

657
00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:19.246
That's all they'll say.

658
00:51:19.346 --> 00:51:20.782
I'm so, so sorry.

659
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.484
No.

660
00:51:30.725 --> 00:51:32.225
Hey.

661
00:51:33.093 --> 00:51:34.394
No! Fuck you!

662
00:51:35.697 --> 00:51:36.864
And fuck you, too!

663
00:51:41.002 --> 00:51:43.270
There has to be a reason.

664
00:51:45.138 --> 00:51:46.708
She called you...

665
00:51:47.575 --> 00:51:48.475
didn't she?

666
00:51:49.409 --> 00:51:51.079
She called you
and she told you

667
00:51:51.178 --> 00:51:52.580
something that got her killed.

668
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.716
Stop lying!

669
00:51:54.816 --> 00:51:56.718
She told you something!

670
00:51:56.818 --> 00:51:58.987
She didn't. I swear.

671
00:52:02.189 --> 00:52:04.424
Peter, she hasn't communicated
with you at all?

672
00:52:13.067 --> 00:52:15.335
Can you look after Sophia?
I need to check on something.

673
00:52:15.435 --> 00:52:18.205
Sure.
I don't need a babysitter.

674
00:52:18.305 --> 00:52:21.576
Maybe I do.
Keep an old man company.

675
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.444
I never even
got to say goodbye.

676
00:52:25.445 --> 00:52:26.581
Hey.

677
00:52:31.418 --> 00:52:34.187
I'm gonna find out who took
your mother away from you.

678
00:52:34.287 --> 00:52:35.790
And then?

679
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:37.257
And then...

680
00:52:37.357 --> 00:52:39.159
he'll do what he does.

681
00:53:09.456 --> 00:53:10.858
<i>Dear Peter:</i>

682
00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:12.292
<i>The hardest thing to see</i>

683
00:53:12.392 --> 00:53:14.529
<i>is what is in front</i>
<i>of your eyes.</i>

684
00:53:14.629 --> 00:53:15.530
<i>El.</i>

685
00:54:11.284 --> 00:54:14.021
<i>Let the team know we've</i>
<i>landed and are now en route.</i>

686
00:54:14.122 --> 00:54:15.422
<i>I want mobile command set up</i>

687
00:54:15.523 --> 00:54:17.390
and a complete download
from Spec Ops

688
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:19.259
the minute I arrive.

689
00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:21.361
How's it feel
to be back in the field, chief?

690
00:54:21.461 --> 00:54:23.497
If I wasn't surrounded
by complete incompetence,

691
00:54:23.598 --> 00:54:24.866
I wouldn't have to be.

692
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:32.039
Intel just received.
Byrne is not at his residence

693
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.975
and is nowhere to be found.

694
00:54:34.075 --> 00:54:36.409
Peter must've made contact.

695
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:38.146
That makes Byrne an accomplice.

696
00:54:38.246 --> 00:54:39.647
Byrne's a company man.

697
00:54:39.747 --> 00:54:41.348
Maybe he's trying
to bring him in peacefully.

698
00:54:41.448 --> 00:54:43.551
Byrne is involved.

699
00:54:49.257 --> 00:54:50.825
Change of plans.

700
00:55:02.136 --> 00:55:03.805
And the files are decrypted.

701
00:55:03.905 --> 00:55:06.874
Metadata shows they're CIA,

702
00:55:06.974 --> 00:55:09.309
from Hidden Hand's server.

703
00:55:09.409 --> 00:55:12.312
Action reports, statistics,
medical records.

704
00:55:12.412 --> 00:55:14.749
Black Operations?
Yeah.

705
00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:17.985
Tied to a clandestine project
called The Internship.

706
00:55:18.085 --> 00:55:19.253
Heard of it?

707
00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:26.928
Open the file that says--

708
00:55:42.844 --> 00:55:44.645
Uh, what's up?

709
00:56:05.266 --> 00:56:06.901
Down!

710
00:56:16.811 --> 00:56:18.346
Finally.

711
00:56:18.445 --> 00:56:19.780
The Painter.

712
00:56:24.652 --> 00:56:27.321
Nice to meet you, too, pal!

713
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.358
Care for a true test
of superiority?

714
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:31.993
No weapons!

715
00:56:32.093 --> 00:56:33.794
Hand-to-hand combat.

716
00:56:33.895 --> 00:56:34.762
Did you set me up?

717
00:56:34.862 --> 00:56:36.463
No! I swear, no!

718
00:56:37.231 --> 00:56:38.498
All right!

719
00:56:39.466 --> 00:56:41.501
Have it your way!

720
00:58:00.514 --> 00:58:01.649
Miles.

721
00:58:01.749 --> 00:58:04.652
Where is The Painter going?

722
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.421
It's Niles.

723
00:58:07.521 --> 00:58:09.323
I don't know.

724
00:58:09.423 --> 00:58:11.459
Honestly, I don't know.

725
00:58:11.559 --> 00:58:13.094
M-m-maybe Lucy's Tavern.

726
00:58:13.194 --> 00:58:14.628
No, she's a dead end.

727
00:58:14.729 --> 00:58:17.131
I assume he got away
with the stolen data?

728
00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:19.133
Yeah.

729
00:58:20.034 --> 00:58:21.168
What was on it?

730
00:58:24.338 --> 00:58:25.706
Probably better
we don't know.

731
00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:28.976
Especially if has to do
with The Internship.

732
00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.961
Lucy?

733
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:23.330
Lucy!

734
00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.001
I'm so sorry, Lucy.

735
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:17.378
<i>Peter,</i>
<i>if you're watching this...</i>

736
01:01:17.478 --> 01:01:18.846
<i>well, you know what it means.</i>

737
01:01:18.946 --> 01:01:20.681
<i>The evidence in these files</i>

738
01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:23.083
<i>came to me</i>
<i>from two former agents</i>

739
01:01:23.184 --> 01:01:25.119
<i>fostering an 8-year-old asset</i>

740
01:01:25.219 --> 01:01:28.590
<i>as part of a training program</i>
<i>called The Internship.</i>

741
01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:31.660
<i>These agents tried to get</i>
<i>the child out of the program.</i>

742
01:01:31.792 --> 01:01:32.960
<i>They didn't make it.</i>

743
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.796
<i>The Internship steals children,</i>

744
01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:37.798
<i>brainwashes,</i>
<i>indoctrinates them,</i>

745
01:01:37.898 --> 01:01:39.700
<i>turns them into assassins.</i>

746
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.537
<i>These people will do</i>
<i>anything and everything</i>

747
01:01:42.637 --> 01:01:44.405
<i>to keep this from getting--</i>

748
01:01:45.574 --> 01:01:46.740
Fuck!

749
01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.510
<i>I'm so sorry, Peter,</i>

750
01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:50.311
<i>for leaving the way I did,</i>

751
01:01:50.411 --> 01:01:54.715
<i>and now it's too late for me</i>
<i>to do anything about it.</i>

752
01:01:57.751 --> 01:01:59.386
<i>I've sent you two files,</i>

753
01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:02.923
<i>in case this falls</i>
<i>into the wrong hands or...</i>

754
01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:04.593
<i>something happens to it.</i>

755
01:02:06.193 --> 01:02:08.762
<i>"Critical redundancy."</i>
"...redundancy."

756
01:02:12.766 --> 01:02:15.936
<i>I found her, Peter.</i>

757
01:02:17.771 --> 01:02:20.975
<i>She's alive! Our baby survived.</i>

758
01:02:21.075 --> 01:02:23.944
<i>I don't know how,</i>
<i>but our daughter is alive.</i>

759
01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:25.813
No, no, no, no, no, no.

760
01:02:25.913 --> 01:02:28.215
<i>She's in grave danger.</i>

761
01:02:28.315 --> 01:02:31.686
<i>You have to find her, Peter.</i>
<i>Protect her.</i>

762
01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:33.087
<i>She's with--</i>

763
01:02:38.693 --> 01:02:39.793
<i>...danger.</i>

764
01:02:39.893 --> 01:02:41.596
<i>You have to find her, Peter.</i>

765
01:02:41.696 --> 01:02:44.398
<i>Protect her. She's with--</i>

766
01:02:44.498 --> 01:02:46.166
Fuck.

767
01:03:30.878 --> 01:03:31.845
Shit.
Move.

768
01:03:31.945 --> 01:03:33.380
Come on, move!

769
01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:39.053
Dad!

770
01:03:40.522 --> 01:03:41.523
Get in!

771
01:03:49.263 --> 01:03:50.164
You okay?

772
01:03:50.264 --> 01:03:51.766
Go after Sophia.

773
01:03:51.865 --> 01:03:54.068
I'll disappear on my own. Go!

774
01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:51.925
Hands up!
Show us your hands!

775
01:04:55.963 --> 01:04:58.232
He's on the move!
Go! Go! Go!

776
01:05:03.904 --> 01:05:05.673
Now, now!

777
01:05:07.174 --> 01:05:08.676
Watch it! Easy!

778
01:05:08.777 --> 01:05:11.078
No place to go!
Get out of the truck!

779
01:05:11.178 --> 01:05:12.913
<i>Hold your positions!</i>

780
01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:19.453
All units, eliminate the target.

781
01:05:32.966 --> 01:05:34.168
Painter's gone, chief.

782
01:05:34.268 --> 01:05:35.436
<i>Repeat: Painter has vanished.</i>

783
01:05:35.537 --> 01:05:36.270
Fuck.

784
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.038
What the hell was that, chief?

785
01:05:38.138 --> 01:05:39.507
Zeta team, move in!

786
01:05:39.607 --> 01:05:40.809
<i>And find him.</i>

787
01:05:40.909 --> 01:05:42.342
Go!
Move in, move in!

788
01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:44.344
Go, go, go!

789
01:05:44.445 --> 01:05:47.715
Do your fucking job, Agent Kim,
and bring me The Painter.

790
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:50.585
Ma'am.

791
01:06:21.348 --> 01:06:22.817
I got your six.

792
01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:25.587
I got your six.
You come with me.

793
01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:29.256
Come with me now.
You'll be safe with me.

794
01:06:29.356 --> 01:06:31.559
You'll be safe with me.

795
01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.697
<i>On y est presque.</i>

796
01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:38.432
<i>On y est presque.</i>

797
01:06:38.533 --> 01:06:40.200
Okay, my brother.

798
01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:48.676
<i>Ca y est.</i> Wait.

799
01:06:51.078 --> 01:06:53.480
No sign of him.

800
01:06:55.115 --> 01:06:57.284
You heard her. Let's go.

801
01:06:59.587 --> 01:07:01.556
The Painter
is nowhere to be found.

802
01:07:01.656 --> 01:07:04.057
We've searched the entire area
in a one-mile radius.

803
01:07:04.157 --> 01:07:05.560
You're telling me
he just vanished?

804
01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:08.630
I don't have a rational
explanation yet, chief.

805
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.932
We have a K-9 unit en route.

806
01:07:11.031 --> 01:07:13.100
<i>We still have the girl.</i>

807
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.636
I can work with that.

808
01:07:14.736 --> 01:07:17.204
<i>Pack it up and lock down</i>
<i>the next location.</i>

809
01:07:17.304 --> 01:07:19.273
Copy that, ma'am.

810
01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:21.208
Okay! Let's go, people!

811
01:07:21.308 --> 01:07:22.777
We are on the move!

812
01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:24.144
You heard her!
Move out!

813
01:07:30.217 --> 01:07:31.886
It's all good, man.

814
01:07:31.986 --> 01:07:34.288
I'll have you patched up
in no time.

815
01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:38.760
<i>Tout ira bien.</i> Don't worry.

816
01:07:51.573 --> 01:07:54.341
Hey! Welcome back.
Welcome back.

817
01:07:54.441 --> 01:07:57.011
Mm, <i>tout va bien, oui?</i>

818
01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:58.412
You're a medic?

819
01:07:58.513 --> 01:07:59.379
Oh, I'm...

820
01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:01.214
I've been a lot of things...

821
01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:03.551
...son.

822
01:08:04.986 --> 01:08:06.688
I always knew
it was you.

823
01:08:06.788 --> 01:08:08.455
I don't believe you.

824
01:08:08.556 --> 01:08:11.526
My arrhythmia. That's what
gave me away all these years.

825
01:08:11.626 --> 01:08:13.861
There's nothing like
an old pacemaker

826
01:08:13.962 --> 01:08:15.262
to camouflage my heartbeat.

827
01:08:15.362 --> 01:08:18.465
Here. Have a souvenir.

828
01:08:21.936 --> 01:08:23.303
Are you ready?

829
01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:28.610
Another souvenir!

830
01:08:31.045 --> 01:08:32.080
How am I?

831
01:08:32.179 --> 01:08:33.982
Good as new, thanks to me.

832
01:08:34.082 --> 01:08:35.315
Nothing broke.

833
01:08:35.717 --> 01:08:38.853
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

834
01:08:40.955 --> 01:08:42.222
There we go.

835
01:08:45.059 --> 01:08:46.594
How long was I out?

836
01:08:47.194 --> 01:08:49.631
About three hours,
give or take.

837
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:51.899
Here's some pain meds.

838
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.368
Here. Have a drink.

839
01:08:56.604 --> 01:08:58.039
Good.

840
01:08:58.138 --> 01:08:59.874
Hey!

841
01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:04.411
No leaks.

842
01:09:04.512 --> 01:09:05.412
Good.

843
01:09:08.683 --> 01:09:09.751
Thank you.

844
01:09:11.786 --> 01:09:13.487
My pleasure, son.

845
01:09:14.454 --> 01:09:16.090
While you were napping,

846
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:18.626
did you figure out
what they want?

847
01:09:18.726 --> 01:09:20.193
You got a computer?

848
01:09:41.783 --> 01:09:43.117
You want a soda?

849
01:09:43.216 --> 01:09:44.786
Something to eat?

850
01:09:44.886 --> 01:09:46.286
Who the fuck are you?

851
01:09:46.386 --> 01:09:47.487
Watch your mouth, young lady.

852
01:09:47.588 --> 01:09:49.157
I'm Section Chief Piasecki,

853
01:09:49.256 --> 01:09:51.592
this is Special Agent Kim, CIA.

854
01:09:52.259 --> 01:09:53.460
What's your name?

855
01:09:57.131 --> 01:09:58.465
I know you're scared,

856
01:09:58.566 --> 01:10:00.568
but we're the good guys here.

857
01:10:01.435 --> 01:10:03.671
Now, what's your involvement
with Peter Barrett?

858
01:10:06.974 --> 01:10:08.676
Did he kidnap you?

859
01:10:08.776 --> 01:10:10.477
Hold you hostage?

860
01:10:12.113 --> 01:10:13.581
Like you kidnapped me?

861
01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:22.222
Leave them.

862
01:10:22.322 --> 01:10:24.257
For her own safety.

863
01:10:26.293 --> 01:10:29.030
You're here because the men you
were with are wanted fugitives,

864
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:31.933
and we're just wondering
how you fit into that equation.

865
01:10:32.033 --> 01:10:33.366
We just need you to answer

866
01:10:33.467 --> 01:10:35.435
a few questions about Peter,
that's all.

867
01:10:36.303 --> 01:10:37.805
Did he hurt you?

868
01:10:38.606 --> 01:10:39.741
No.

869
01:10:43.111 --> 01:10:44.812
My name is Sophia.

870
01:10:46.346 --> 01:10:49.416
My mother
is Special Agent Elena Maran.

871
01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:51.485
Elena Maran?

872
01:10:52.153 --> 01:10:53.688
I didn't know
she had a daughter.

873
01:10:53.788 --> 01:10:56.624
She worked under me for years,
but...

874
01:10:56.724 --> 01:10:58.593
never mentioned
a thing about you.

875
01:10:58.693 --> 01:11:00.528
Yeah. Now she can't, can she?

876
01:11:01.662 --> 01:11:02.930
You know.

877
01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:07.635
I am so sorry
about what happened.

878
01:11:08.636 --> 01:11:11.304
Is that why you killed her?
Why would you say that?

879
01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:13.207
Maybe because you sent
a bunch of assholes

880
01:11:13.306 --> 01:11:14.542
to kill me and my dad.

881
01:11:14.642 --> 01:11:15.777
Your dad?

882
01:11:17.211 --> 01:11:19.479
Your dad is Peter Barrett?

883
01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.448
This gets more interesting
by the minute.

884
01:11:21.549 --> 01:11:22.717
Did he tell you that?

885
01:11:25.385 --> 01:11:29.489
Sophia, the CIA doesn't
want to kill you or Peter.

886
01:11:30.224 --> 01:11:34.195
The goal was to bring him in
for questioning peacefully,

887
01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:35.830
and he reacted with violence.

888
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:38.733
Funny, 'cause I was there.

889
01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:42.069
And it was "shoot first,
ask questions later."

890
01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:44.939
Did he say
or have anything on him,

891
01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:46.808
like a flash drive?

892
01:11:58.186 --> 01:12:00.922
I think there's more to this
than what you're telling us.

893
01:12:01.956 --> 01:12:03.591
I don't know shit.

894
01:12:04.391 --> 01:12:06.493
I just want to find out
what happened to my mom.

895
01:12:06.594 --> 01:12:07.695
Hmm.

896
01:12:08.763 --> 01:12:11.364
Let me remind you, withholding
a person's whereabouts

897
01:12:11.464 --> 01:12:14.569
has some
very serious consequences.

898
01:12:17.605 --> 01:12:19.339
You don't scare me.

899
01:12:20.942 --> 01:12:22.043
Don't worry.

900
01:12:23.177 --> 01:12:24.946
There's still time.

901
01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:28.216
Everyone out!

902
01:12:28.816 --> 01:12:30.751
Chief, that's against protocol.

903
01:12:30.852 --> 01:12:33.486
I don't recall
asking your opinion, Agent Kim.

904
01:12:44.298 --> 01:12:45.867
Now...

905
01:12:46.366 --> 01:12:47.935
where were we?

906
01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:53.741
This drive
is pretty banged up, Peter.

907
01:13:00.982 --> 01:13:02.817
Bingo. We're in.

908
01:13:07.788 --> 01:13:10.658
Peter, did you see this?
They're recruiting kids.

909
01:13:10.758 --> 01:13:13.794
They're stealing them, raising
them with agency parents.

910
01:13:13.895 --> 01:13:15.663
They're temporarily
blinding them

911
01:13:15.763 --> 01:13:17.464
so they over-develop
their other senses.

912
01:13:17.565 --> 01:13:18.966
She's turning them
into you.

913
01:13:19.066 --> 01:13:20.101
"She"?

914
01:13:20.201 --> 01:13:21.702
Naomi Piasecki.

915
01:13:22.336 --> 01:13:24.605
She must've gone rogue
years ago.

916
01:13:25.506 --> 01:13:27.875
What's going on here?
What's happening?

917
01:13:27.975 --> 01:13:31.145
This thing has some kind of
virus coded into it.

918
01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:33.014
Pull the drive!

919
01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:34.215
Oh, shit!

920
01:13:35.883 --> 01:13:37.852
Goddamn it!

921
01:13:37.952 --> 01:13:38.920
We lost everything!

922
01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.689
Shit! We've lost
every fucking thing!

923
01:13:41.789 --> 01:13:44.225
We lost it! They tried
to kill you over this,

924
01:13:44.325 --> 01:13:46.527
and now it's... now it's...

925
01:13:46.627 --> 01:13:48.029
now it's gone!

926
01:13:48.963 --> 01:13:50.631
Peter, I'm so sorry.

927
01:13:54.467 --> 01:13:55.937
What are you smiling about?

928
01:13:57.104 --> 01:13:58.639
"Critical redundancy."

929
01:14:03.744 --> 01:14:04.712
What?

930
01:14:05.346 --> 01:14:06.647
There's a copy.

931
01:14:08.382 --> 01:14:10.851
Well, let's go get it!
Not yet.

932
01:14:10.952 --> 01:14:13.521
I owe it to Elena
to get Sophia back first.

933
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:37.511
Mind if I borrow
a few things?

934
01:14:43.351 --> 01:14:45.485
We need that unpacked now!

935
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.055
How we doing? Show me.

936
01:14:48.155 --> 01:14:50.091
Show me this.
Okay, we need more than this.

937
01:14:50.191 --> 01:14:51.959
I need more angles.

938
01:14:53.327 --> 01:14:54.628
Come on!
Let's get these visuals up!

939
01:14:54.729 --> 01:14:56.630
We needed them up yesterday.

940
01:14:56.731 --> 01:14:58.766
What was that all about?
Out of my way.

941
01:14:58.866 --> 01:15:00.434
She's a kid. She has rights.

942
01:15:00.634 --> 01:15:02.837
You cannot question a minor
without another agent.

943
01:15:02.937 --> 01:15:05.473
Everything she said
will be inadmissible.

944
01:15:05.573 --> 01:15:08.342
Our responsibility
is to stop a dangerous fugitive

945
01:15:08.442 --> 01:15:10.111
from killing anyone else.

946
01:15:10.978 --> 01:15:12.480
I'm gonna have
to call this in.

947
01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.548
I'm gonna call it in
and report it myself

948
01:15:14.648 --> 01:15:16.283
after the threat is neutralized!

949
01:15:16.384 --> 01:15:19.320
Did you even search the girl
before you put her in holding?

950
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.554
Of course.
Really?

951
01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:22.656
Then what the fuck is this?

952
01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:26.193
Fail.

953
01:15:26.293 --> 01:15:27.528
Attention, everyone!

954
01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:29.430
The Painter is incoming.

955
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:33.000
I need eyes on him before he
steps foot into this facility.

956
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.402
Am I clear?

957
01:15:34.502 --> 01:15:36.137
- Move!
- You heard her! Let's go!

958
01:15:36.237 --> 01:15:39.340
Intercept teams, into position.
The Painter is coming in hot.

959
01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.077
We are code red.
I repeat, code red.

960
01:15:51.786 --> 01:15:53.287
I'm gonna go over here.

961
01:15:54.922 --> 01:15:56.223
You heard her!
Let's go!

962
01:15:58.993 --> 01:16:01.262
Southwest corner. I need
teams on the southwest corner!

963
01:16:01.362 --> 01:16:03.130
We are empty over there!

964
01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:06.400
North is good.
We need the west side, though.

965
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.635
West side, please.

966
01:16:11.205 --> 01:16:14.642
All right. Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Move it!

967
01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:17.611
Southwest corner! We need teams
on the southwest corner!

968
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:19.814
<i>Southwest corner! Move!</i>

969
01:16:29.223 --> 01:16:31.325
Perimeter around me. Now!

970
01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:36.864
You two, with me!
Defensive formation.

971
01:16:37.631 --> 01:16:40.034
Hold! Hold your position!

972
01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:57.017
Heads up!

973
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:03.558
We have a man down!

974
01:17:11.899 --> 01:17:13.868
Where is he?

975
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:16.437
Chief!

976
01:17:16.538 --> 01:17:17.771
Shit!

977
01:17:17.872 --> 01:17:19.940
Move.

978
01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.109
More down! Where is he?

979
01:17:22.209 --> 01:17:23.844
Anyone got eyes on him?

980
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.289
We need to move you to
a more secure location, Sophia.

981
01:18:08.389 --> 01:18:10.257
Why are you helping me?

982
01:18:10.357 --> 01:18:13.260
The situation
has gotten out of control.

983
01:18:14.962 --> 01:18:16.631
It is too dangerous
for you here.

984
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:19.733
What about my dad?
Is he okay?

985
01:18:24.838 --> 01:18:26.840
We need to go now.

986
01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:29.043
Okay. Okay.

987
01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:34.748
Come on! Let's go. Go!

988
01:18:40.487 --> 01:18:41.590
Keep going! Eyes up!

989
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:42.990
There's a weapon down here.

990
01:18:46.093 --> 01:18:48.229
Watch your corners.
Move, move!

991
01:19:20.894 --> 01:19:22.763
This way! Move!

992
01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:43.585
And where do you think
you're going?

993
01:19:43.685 --> 01:19:45.886
Moving her to a safer location.

994
01:19:54.763 --> 01:19:56.297
Come with me.

995
01:19:57.298 --> 01:19:58.799
Both of you.

996
01:20:47.181 --> 01:20:48.449
I'll take it from here.

997
01:20:49.383 --> 01:20:51.619
I can't let you do that.

998
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.656
You're disregarding
a direct order from a superior.

999
01:20:54.756 --> 01:20:56.323
Stand the fuck down, Agent Kim.

1000
01:20:56.423 --> 01:20:58.992
It's over, Piasecki!
This whole operation is over.

1001
01:20:59.093 --> 01:21:00.595
I am taking her in, and we can--

1002
01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.108
Move.

1003
01:21:26.954 --> 01:21:28.122
Come on, kid. Move.

1004
01:21:31.593 --> 01:21:32.926
Let her go.

1005
01:21:34.228 --> 01:21:35.129
Dad.

1006
01:21:41.301 --> 01:21:42.436
Painter!

1007
01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:44.004
Let's finish this.

1008
01:21:45.673 --> 01:21:47.241
Dad.

1009
01:21:48.843 --> 01:21:51.378
Really?
Come on. You're gonna shoot me?

1010
01:21:51.478 --> 01:21:54.014
That's so boring.
Let's play a game.

1011
01:21:54.114 --> 01:21:56.417
Who is the better intern?

1012
01:21:56.518 --> 01:21:57.918
Patient Zero...

1013
01:21:58.018 --> 01:21:59.319
or the new-and-improved?

1014
01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.988
I'm not here
for your milestones.

1015
01:22:07.695 --> 01:22:10.264
Really? You're gonna deprive me

1016
01:22:10.364 --> 01:22:13.400
of the opportunity to prove
that I'm better than you?

1017
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.970
That's... No, that's...
That's fair. That makes sense.

1018
01:22:39.092 --> 01:22:40.528
I don't want to do this, kid.

1019
01:22:40.628 --> 01:22:42.129
These people, they...

1020
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:45.667
kidnapped you, tortured you,
brainwashed you,

1021
01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:49.203
all to make you something
you were never supposed to be.

1022
01:22:49.303 --> 01:22:50.605
Me.

1023
01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:55.275
What's your real name?

1024
01:22:56.210 --> 01:22:59.346
It's... It's Daniel.

1025
01:22:59.446 --> 01:23:01.850
Well, it doesn't have
to go down like this, Daniel.

1026
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:03.818
You can go have a whole life.

1027
01:23:03.918 --> 01:23:05.452
Fall in love, have kids.

1028
01:23:05.553 --> 01:23:07.822
But you got to make
that choice for yourself.

1029
01:23:07.922 --> 01:23:09.490
That does sound nice.

1030
01:23:13.126 --> 01:23:15.062
But I like who I am.

1031
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:17.599
So enough with the pity party.

1032
01:23:17.699 --> 01:23:19.166
And don't feel sorry for me.

1033
01:23:19.266 --> 01:23:22.002
Sure, the whole forced-blindness
thing kind of sucked,

1034
01:23:22.102 --> 01:23:23.872
but it made me special.

1035
01:23:23.972 --> 01:23:25.138
And for the record,

1036
01:23:25.239 --> 01:23:28.041
they didn't force me
to be like you.

1037
01:23:30.043 --> 01:23:31.111
They forced me to be better.

1038
01:24:34.509 --> 01:24:35.843
Whoo!

1039
01:24:35.944 --> 01:24:37.477
Come on!

1040
01:24:41.749 --> 01:24:45.218
You know, Elena had
more fight in her than you do.

1041
01:24:45.319 --> 01:24:47.655
She really
stuck her neck out there.

1042
01:25:18.452 --> 01:25:22.422
Peter, come find us.

1043
01:25:25.893 --> 01:25:27.595
Dad!

1044
01:25:28.161 --> 01:25:29.864
Dad, please!

1045
01:25:32.432 --> 01:25:34.468
Dad, can you hear me?

1046
01:25:59.393 --> 01:26:01.461
What took you so long?

1047
01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:09.202
I've been waiting a long time
to meet you, Painter.

1048
01:26:13.975 --> 01:26:16.844
You must be Naomi Piasecki.

1049
01:26:16.944 --> 01:26:19.781
Hmm. Byrne told you about me?

1050
01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:22.550
He said you were ruthless.

1051
01:26:23.885 --> 01:26:26.186
I'm a little more than that.

1052
01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:29.389
God, Byrne would never
shut up about you.

1053
01:26:29.489 --> 01:26:32.126
All those years I worked
for him, he'd go on and on,

1054
01:26:32.225 --> 01:26:33.961
how you were the best
that ever was,

1055
01:26:34.062 --> 01:26:35.495
and the best he ever saw.

1056
01:26:35.596 --> 01:26:38.198
Jesus Christ,
it made me want to puke.

1057
01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:46.908
What, you think
you're the only one

1058
01:26:47.008 --> 01:26:48.543
that knows how
to dodge a bullet?

1059
01:26:49.276 --> 01:26:50.511
You're an Intern.

1060
01:26:50.611 --> 01:26:53.981
I'm the Head Intern, see?

1061
01:26:54.082 --> 01:26:56.951
They used to call me Mimic.
Now they call me the boss.

1062
01:26:58.452 --> 01:26:59.721
Dad!

1063
01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.564
Toss the weapon, Peter.

1064
01:27:10.732 --> 01:27:11.999
Game's over.

1065
01:27:21.743 --> 01:27:23.410
You okay?

1066
01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.682
Now where's that flash drive?

1067
01:27:34.387 --> 01:27:36.724
Put it down! Put it down!

1068
01:27:36.824 --> 01:27:37.792
Put it down!

1069
01:27:41.162 --> 01:27:42.930
Told you I had your six, son.

1070
01:27:45.967 --> 01:27:47.267
What are you doing, Peter?

1071
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:51.172
Piasecki isn't
running The Internship.

1072
01:27:51.271 --> 01:27:52.874
She works for you.

1073
01:27:52.974 --> 01:27:55.576
The Internship's yours.
It's always been yours.

1074
01:27:55.676 --> 01:27:57.712
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

1075
01:27:57.812 --> 01:28:00.313
That's absurd, Peter.
Don't lie to me!

1076
01:28:00.413 --> 01:28:02.083
You told me
you never worked with her,

1077
01:28:02.183 --> 01:28:03.651
but she sure seems
to know you.

1078
01:28:03.751 --> 01:28:06.254
She's an Intern.
She didn't start the program.

1079
01:28:06.353 --> 01:28:08.488
She couldn't have!
And you think it was me?

1080
01:28:08.589 --> 01:28:11.092
Who else could it be?
You must've been training her

1081
01:28:11.192 --> 01:28:13.861
around the time I started
to kill people for the CIA.

1082
01:28:13.961 --> 01:28:15.730
You saw what I'd become.

1083
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:17.799
You figured
you could do it again.

1084
01:28:17.899 --> 01:28:20.500
Okay. You got me.

1085
01:28:21.269 --> 01:28:23.303
There's too much oversight here

1086
01:28:23.403 --> 01:28:25.305
for me to stay on any further.

1087
01:28:25.405 --> 01:28:27.809
I'm going to make you
section chief,

1088
01:28:27.909 --> 01:28:29.677
and I'm going to retire

1089
01:28:30.343 --> 01:28:32.079
and run things
from the outside.

1090
01:28:37.518 --> 01:28:38.686
What's going on?

1091
01:28:38.786 --> 01:28:40.521
Step away from him
and come to me.

1092
01:28:40.621 --> 01:28:41.989
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad--

1093
01:28:42.089 --> 01:28:43.724
Let her go!
Dad.

1094
01:28:43.825 --> 01:28:45.760
I didn't want it
to come to this, Peter.

1095
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.695
I wanted you out of this.
"Out of this"?

1096
01:28:47.795 --> 01:28:49.297
She's been trying to kill me
since this started.

1097
01:28:49.396 --> 01:28:50.731
That's pretty fuckin' far
from "out."

1098
01:28:50.832 --> 01:28:52.399
You would've been dead
if it was up to me.

1099
01:28:52.499 --> 01:28:54.168
Will you shut up?

1100
01:28:54.268 --> 01:28:56.838
My underling may have
been a little overzealous.

1101
01:28:56.938 --> 01:28:58.272
I apologize.

1102
01:28:58.371 --> 01:29:00.440
I need the location
of that backup, Peter.

1103
01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:02.710
Sophia and I will take
a nice little drive,

1104
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:05.613
and once it's in my hands,
you'll get her back.

1105
01:29:05.713 --> 01:29:08.182
You're stealing
and torturing children.

1106
01:29:08.282 --> 01:29:10.051
I'm doing what's necessary!

1107
01:29:10.151 --> 01:29:12.687
You think our enemies
aren't doing the same and worse?

1108
01:29:12.787 --> 01:29:14.522
I am protecting
our nation, Peter,

1109
01:29:14.622 --> 01:29:17.158
so people can
sleep peacefully at night.

1110
01:29:17.258 --> 01:29:19.861
This is about your legacy.
Nothing more.

1111
01:29:19.961 --> 01:29:21.662
Oh, Peter.

1112
01:29:21.762 --> 01:29:24.031
You were supposed
to be my legacy.

1113
01:29:25.432 --> 01:29:26.901
Now she is.

1114
01:29:39.814 --> 01:29:42.884
You don't have
to listen to him, Sophia.

1115
01:29:42.984 --> 01:29:44.919
I am your father.

1116
01:29:45.019 --> 01:29:46.320
What is he talking about?

1117
01:29:46.419 --> 01:29:48.923
Oh, what better cover
than the truth?

1118
01:29:49.023 --> 01:29:50.423
Yes, he is your father,

1119
01:29:50.524 --> 01:29:52.159
but you belong to me, Sophia.

1120
01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.729
No. You don't.

1121
01:29:55.563 --> 01:29:57.464
Just give him the flash drive.

1122
01:29:58.065 --> 01:29:59.399
I can't do that.

1123
01:30:01.602 --> 01:30:03.470
You see, Peter?

1124
01:30:03.571 --> 01:30:06.574
You see? Internship works!

1125
01:30:06.674 --> 01:30:08.876
And you were the prototype,
the catalyst

1126
01:30:08.976 --> 01:30:11.812
for the entire program,
and you are magnificent, Peter.

1127
01:30:11.913 --> 01:30:14.048
You surpassed
every expectation.

1128
01:30:14.148 --> 01:30:15.482
But did you really think

1129
01:30:15.583 --> 01:30:17.484
that I was gonna
rely on just one man,

1130
01:30:17.585 --> 01:30:19.887
when I needed an army?

1131
01:30:20.521 --> 01:30:21.923
This is the future!

1132
01:30:22.023 --> 01:30:25.326
And you are the past,
but we are one family.

1133
01:30:25.425 --> 01:30:26.493
She's your own granddaughter.

1134
01:30:26.594 --> 01:30:28.562
I didn't want it
to come to this.

1135
01:30:28.663 --> 01:30:31.165
When I deleted those files,
I thought it was over,

1136
01:30:31.265 --> 01:30:34.168
but Elena had to send you
that stupid duplicate.

1137
01:30:34.268 --> 01:30:36.737
Don't you ever say her name.

1138
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.410
I don't care if I die,

1139
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:44.879
but you can't spend your life
loyal to a man

1140
01:30:44.979 --> 01:30:48.282
who took you from your family,
from your real parents...

1141
01:30:48.382 --> 01:30:49.283
from your mother.

1142
01:30:49.383 --> 01:30:51.886
No! Get off me!

1143
01:30:51.986 --> 01:30:54.055
No!

1144
01:31:05.866 --> 01:31:07.401
Hi, sweetie. Hey.

1145
01:31:12.773 --> 01:31:15.242
<i>Byrne stole you from us</i>
<i>when you were born.</i>

1146
01:31:15.343 --> 01:31:16.811
<i>Let us believe you were dead.</i>

1147
01:31:16.911 --> 01:31:18.612
And when your mom
found out about you...

1148
01:31:18.713 --> 01:31:20.881
You fucking piece of shit,
how could you?

1149
01:31:20.982 --> 01:31:23.851
All these years,
and you had her the whole time!

1150
01:31:23.951 --> 01:31:25.186
You sick fuck!

1151
01:31:25.286 --> 01:31:27.588
Your own granddaughter!

1152
01:31:27.688 --> 01:31:29.957
Elena, there's much
you don't know.

1153
01:31:30.057 --> 01:31:32.093
We need to talk.
Fuck your talk.

1154
01:31:32.193 --> 01:31:34.462
Give me my daughter now!

1155
01:31:37.965 --> 01:31:39.133
Elena.

1156
01:31:41.501 --> 01:31:43.137
You're not gonna shoot me.

1157
01:31:51.512 --> 01:31:54.048
Peter's gonna
know everything soon,

1158
01:31:54.148 --> 01:31:55.049
and when he does--

1159
01:32:00.254 --> 01:32:01.622
He killed her.

1160
01:32:02.289 --> 01:32:06.727
She died trying to protect you
from this monster.

1161
01:32:07.428 --> 01:32:09.430
Just come with me.

1162
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:11.599
We'll put this all behind us.

1163
01:32:11.699 --> 01:32:13.734
She's an Intern, Peter.

1164
01:32:13.834 --> 01:32:17.271
She's trained in advanced
psychological warfare.

1165
01:32:17.371 --> 01:32:21.175
New and improved.
She has none of your weaknesses.

1166
01:32:22.009 --> 01:32:22.910
He's right.

1167
01:32:23.744 --> 01:32:24.879
You're stronger than me.

1168
01:32:24.979 --> 01:32:26.614
But what he calls my weakness

1169
01:32:26.714 --> 01:32:29.984
is the love that I had
for your mother,

1170
01:32:30.084 --> 01:32:31.185
that I have for you.

1171
01:32:31.285 --> 01:32:32.620
And her love for you

1172
01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.088
is what brought us together.

1173
01:32:34.188 --> 01:32:35.456
You still have a choice

1174
01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:36.557
in who you become.

1175
01:32:36.657 --> 01:32:38.292
Enough of this.

1176
01:32:38.392 --> 01:32:39.794
You won't give me the evidence?

1177
01:32:39.894 --> 01:32:42.630
It dies with you. Intern...

1178
01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:45.534
complete the mission.
Terminate the target.

1179
01:32:45.633 --> 01:32:48.602
The happiest day of my life
was when I found out

1180
01:32:48.702 --> 01:32:50.404
your mother
was pregnant with you.

1181
01:32:50.504 --> 01:32:53.574
You have her eyes
and her will...

1182
01:32:54.175 --> 01:32:55.042
her strength.

1183
01:32:55.142 --> 01:32:56.410
Intern.

1184
01:32:56.511 --> 01:32:58.179
Her temper.

1185
01:33:01.215 --> 01:33:02.650
And her courage.

1186
01:33:05.219 --> 01:33:06.754
Intern.

1187
01:33:09.957 --> 01:33:11.025
Intern!

1188
01:33:12.359 --> 01:33:13.260
Intern!

1189
01:33:34.348 --> 01:33:36.317
She's still...

1190
01:33:36.417 --> 01:33:38.752
her father's daughter.

1191
01:33:51.899 --> 01:33:54.068
He was ahead of his time.

1192
01:33:54.969 --> 01:33:56.737
But his time is over.

1193
01:33:58.038 --> 01:34:00.941
He was thinking way too small.

1194
01:34:02.042 --> 01:34:03.844
Thinking that
my brothers and sisters and I

1195
01:34:03.944 --> 01:34:05.547
are merely assassins,

1196
01:34:05.646 --> 01:34:08.249
when there is so much more
we are capable of.

1197
01:34:10.718 --> 01:34:12.386
I can't wait to meet them.

1198
01:34:17.758 --> 01:34:19.293
I'm gonna need
the flash drive...

1199
01:34:21.896 --> 01:34:24.231
and I will be coming for it.

1200
01:34:29.003 --> 01:34:30.471
The next time I see you,

1201
01:34:30.572 --> 01:34:31.805
I might not remember
you're my father.

1202
01:34:31.906 --> 01:34:34.041
I won't forget
you're my daughter...

1203
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:36.777
but I'll be waiting for you.

1204
01:34:40.582 --> 01:34:42.016
Lena.

1205
01:34:42.683 --> 01:34:43.751
What?

1206
01:34:43.851 --> 01:34:45.719
That's what we named you.

1207
01:34:46.453 --> 01:34:48.389
After Elena's grandmother.

1208
01:34:48.489 --> 01:34:51.158
That's your real name, Lena.

1209
01:34:53.727 --> 01:34:55.329
Lena.

1210
01:34:59.601 --> 01:35:01.570
I prefer The Pretender.

1211
01:35:16.217 --> 01:35:17.251
Help me.

1212
01:35:23.791 --> 01:35:25.726
Help yourself.

1213
01:35:28.762 --> 01:35:30.931
Fuck you, Peter.

1214
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:16.810
<i>Peter, if you're</i>
<i>watching this...</i>

1215
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:19.313
<i>...she's with Byrne.</i>

1216
01:36:19.413 --> 01:36:21.949
<i>That son of a bitch</i>
<i>stole our daughter,</i>

1217
01:36:22.049 --> 01:36:24.051
<i>and I'm going</i>
<i>to confront him, but...</i>

1218
01:36:24.985 --> 01:36:27.021
<i>But if anything</i>
<i>happens to me,</i>

1219
01:36:27.121 --> 01:36:29.490
<i>you have to be the one</i>
<i>to finish this.</i>

1220
01:36:30.759 --> 01:36:32.159
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>there are enough words</i>

1221
01:36:32.259 --> 01:36:34.596
<i>for me to tell you</i>
<i>what I need to tell you,</i>

1222
01:36:34.696 --> 01:36:37.931
<i>but let me start by saying</i>
<i>this drive contains dossiers</i>

1223
01:36:38.032 --> 01:36:40.801
<i>on every Intern there is...</i>

1224
01:36:40.901 --> 01:36:42.202
<i>like our daughter.</i>

1225
01:36:43.037 --> 01:36:45.640
<i>You have to help her, Peter.</i>

1226
01:36:49.577 --> 01:36:51.513
<i>You have to help them all.</i>
