1
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.902
Your breakfast, sir.

2
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.543
Pork bellies.

3
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.381
I have a hunch something
very exciting is going to happen

4
00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.342
in the pork belly
market this morning.

5
00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:42.237
Will Miss Penelope be dining
with you this evening, sir?

6
00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.024
Yes. Yes, she will.

7
00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.108
Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

8
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.152
Morning, Folsey.

9
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.837
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

10
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:41.496
Morning.

11
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.915
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

12
00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.424
Morning.

13
00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.589
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

14
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:47.252
Morning.

15
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.340
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

16
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.755
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

17
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.298
Morning.

18
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.766
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

19
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.051
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

20
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.015
Good morning.

21
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.937
Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

22
00:05:57.983 --> 00:05:59.894
Morning.

23
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.939
Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

24
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:04.899
Morning.

25
00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:27.627
Pork bellies.
I knew it. I knew it!

26
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.106
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

27
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.066
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

28
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:48.897
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

29
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.860
Morning,
Mr. Duke.

30
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.652
Good morning, Mr. Duke.
Good morning, Mr. Duke.

31
00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:53.704
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

32
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:54.782
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

33
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.866
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

34
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:56.951
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

35
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.583
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

36
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:32.778
When do we sell?

37
00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:36.991
I just cannot believe how
stupid these scientists are.

38
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.326
"The eternal question.”

39
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.055
There is no question.
The answer's obvious.

40
00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:43.919
I don't care about heredity
versus environment.

41
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.830
In fact, I'm sick and tired
of hearing it.

42
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.294
I care about how much money
we can get for our pork bellies.

43
00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:51.256
Winthorpe put in a sell order
for 76 and a quarter.

44
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.762
His charts say that's
as high as it's gonna go.

45
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.925
It'll never get that high.
Let's sell now.

46
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.467
Patience, Mortimer.

47
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.978
Let's see if Winthorpe's right.

48
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.852
Winthorpe's wrong.
It's topped out.

49
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.356
I say we sell now.

50
00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:06.688
Just another few seconds.

51
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:11.071
The market's closing.
We won't get the order in.

52
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:34.296
We just made an extra $347,000.

53
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.008
Get me Winthorpe.

54
00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.845
Well, of course I never
had an instant of doubt

55
00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:39.758
in my mind, Mortimer.

56
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:44.556
Oh, yes, I'm sure a lot of
people went belly-up on that one.

57
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.190
I'll see you at the club.

58
00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.430
Morning,
Mr. Duke.

59
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.432
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

60
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.262
Thank you very much.

61
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:25.270
Vietnam did this to me,
but I'm not bitter, thank you.

62
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.897
Merry Christmas!
Happy Hanukkah?

63
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.431
Yeah, how're you doing?

64
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.396
Spare a poor war veteran
some change?

65
00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.606
I'm on my knees for life.

66
00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.520
I have no money to give you.

67
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.531
Please, anything.
A quarter.

68
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.362
Anything,
just a couple of dollars.

69
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.153
Anything, a quarter,
a nickel, please.

70
00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.948
Hey, man, I really
don't appreciate this.

71
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.206
I don't care what it is.

72
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.869
Smoked ham, anything.
Some crackers.

73
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:49.536
Thanks a lot.

74
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.375
How'd you like
a stump up your ass?

75
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.664
Stay out of here!

76
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.675
You got a lot of soul.
I appreciate it.

77
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.138
Listen to this.

78
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.721
"Expect this stagnation
to continue

79
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.480
"until the Department of
Agriculture's January crop report.”

80
00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:12.314
Exactly as we thought, Randolph.

81
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:15.855
Wrong. Quite wrong. Untrue.

82
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.524
They've given this genetics
fellow the Nobel Prize.

83
00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.694
The man doesn't know the
first thing about human nature.

84
00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:26.365
Randolph. We're about to make
millions of dollars in frozen orange juice

85
00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.454
and you're talking to me
about human nature.

86
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:31.040
Money isn't everything,
Mortimer.

87
00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:31.703
Oh, grow up.

88
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.123
Mother always said
you were greedy.

89
00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:37.463
She meant it as a compliment.

90
00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.972
Ezra, right on time.

91
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.981
I'll bet you thought I'd
forgotten your Christmas bonus.

92
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.563
There you are.

93
00:10:53.611 --> 00:11:00.156
$5. Maybe I'll go to
the movies by myself.

94
00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.943
Half of it is from me.

95
00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.121
Thank you, Mr. Mortimer.

96
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.046
Gentlemen.

97
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.176
Looking good, Louis.

98
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.086
Feeling good, Todd.

99
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:25.007
We need a fourth for squash
today, Louis. Are you interested?

100
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:30.179
No can do. I'll be having
dinner with Penelope tonight.

101
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.438
Oh, lucky you.

102
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:35.942
It's not luck. Todd.

103
00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.203
Randolph, Mortimer.

104
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.455
Winthorpe, my boy,
what have you got for us?

105
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.832
Well, it's that time
of the month again.

106
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.040
Payroll checks
for our employees,

107
00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:56.125
which require your signatures.

108
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.040
And no forgetting
to sign the big ones.

109
00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:02.336
We seem to be paying some of
our employees an awful lot of money.

110
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:06.302
Can't get around the old
minimum wage, Mortimer.

111
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:17.856
$50,000 to Clarence Beeks!
Who the hell...

112
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.654
I meant to ask you about that.

113
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.986
I went through
personal records thoroughly

114
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.155
and there doesn't seem to be

115
00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.319
a Clarence Beeks
employed with the firm.

116
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.451
Oh, oh.

117
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.787
Clarence Beeks.
Oh, yes, of course.

118
00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.578
He's doing something
top secret for us.

119
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.838
Research.

120
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.170
How is Penelope?

121
00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.130
Never forget she's our
grandniece, Winthorpe.

122
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.170
You'd better make
an honest woman of her.

123
00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.242
Well, I'll certainly try, sir.

124
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:49.384
Actually, the wedding
invitations go out this week.

125
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:52.518
Good. Good work, Winthorpe.

126
00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.563
Don't worry about this,
Winthorpe.

127
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:59.476
I'll take care of
this one personally.

128
00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.445
Goodbye, Winthorpe.

129
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.982
Goodbye, Winthorpe.

130
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:18.082
Winthorpe is
a very steady young man.

131
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.984
We're lucky to have him
managing our firm for us.

132
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:25.845
Oh, hogwash. Exeter, Harvard,
he's the product of good environment.

133
00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:28.755
It's got nothing to do
with environment.

134
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.015
With his genes, you could
put Winthorpe anywhere

135
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.121
and he's gonna come out on top.

136
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:35.137
Breeding, Randolph,
same as in race horses.

137
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:37.396
It's in the blood.

138
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.524
Hey, baby, what's happening?

139
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:48.157
How you doing?

140
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:52.571
Once you have a man with no
legs, you never go back, baby.

141
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:54.034
I know what you're thinking.

142
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.994
You seen Porgy and Bess?

143
00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:59.537
We can make it, baby.
Me and you.

144
00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.338
You bitch!

145
00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.144
Who's that? Who's
there? What you want?

146
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.645
Police.
We've had some complaints

147
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.729
about con men pretending
to be blind and crippled.

148
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:22.838
Oh, I'd love to help you, man,

149
00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.695
but I ain't seen nothing since
I stepped on that landmine

150
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.525
in Vietcong back in '72.

151
00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:27.780
It was rough, very painful.

152
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:31.534
You were in Nam?
So were we. Where?

153
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.995
I was in Sang Bang, Dang Gong.

154
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.204
I was all over that place, basically
a lot of places, a lot of places.

155
00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:39.993
What unit were you in?

156
00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.286
I was with the Green Berets,

157
00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:44.923
Special Unit Battalion's
Commando Airborne Tactics

158
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.709
Specialist Tactics
Unit Battalion.

159
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:48.882
Yeah, it was real hush-hush.

160
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.388
I was Agent Orange. That
was my name, Agent Orange.

161
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.423
Special Agent Orange,
that was me.

162
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:56.059
Airborne, huh?

163
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.113
I can see! I can see!

164
00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.818
I have... I have legs.

165
00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:12.154
I have...
Oh shit, look at this.

166
00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.989
Man! I can walk.

167
00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:17.121
Jesus, praise Jesus.

168
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.578
I appreciate this.
Oh, this is beautiful.

169
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.747
I can't believe...
Thank you.

170
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.082
I just don't know
what to do. It's...

171
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.294
Glory be to God.
Praise Jesus.

172
00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:26.956
Look at me.

173
00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.171
This is too much.
I can't believe it.

174
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.678
You're beautiful.
Listen, I can't thank you.

175
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:34.464
First Moses, now this.
God, Jesus...

176
00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:36.224
Oh, baby, look at me.

177
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.512
I'm so happy. Oh, God.
Look at me, this is too much.

178
00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:42.101
What a happy day.
What a happy day!

179
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.377
Really, I appreciate it, y'all.

180
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.857
Okay now. All
right. Look at this.

181
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.519
I can walk. I don't
know what to say.

182
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:48.674
I'll be all right.
Take it easy.

183
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:53.659
You're beautiful, both
of you all, the two of you.

184
00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.869
How're you doing?

185
00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.339
Oh, I'm sorry about that, man.

186
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.469
Stop, thief.

187
00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:14.595
Help, help!

188
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.971
What are you talking about, man?

189
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.161
Don't shoot.
Take it, take it.

190
00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.347
Please don't kill me.
I'm getting married.

191
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.807
Hey, I don't want your bag, man.

192
00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.642
Help! Help!

193
00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.103
Help! Help!

194
00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.359
Help!

195
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:31.317
He's in there. After him.

196
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:36.158
Excuse me.

197
00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:39.538
Watch out. He
probably has a weapon.

198
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.033
Stop him.
He has my briefcase.

199
00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.085
Stop him! Stop him!

200
00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:45.914
He's inside.
That boy's crazy.

201
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.749
He's
escaping. Get him. Shit.

202
00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:50.586
- Look at him.
- Get out of the way.

203
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.501
Get him.
He's getting away.

204
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.419
There he is. That's
him. Get him. Get him.

205
00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.839
He's under the table.
Somebody go under there.

206
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:57.926
Somebody get down there.

207
00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:01.343
Right there. Right
there. There he is.

208
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.473
Is there a problem, officers?

209
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:17.030
What in heaven's name
is going on here?

210
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.989
He tried to rob
the payroll, Randolph.

211
00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.182
He attacked me
in broad daylight.

212
00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.287
I didn't do nothing, man.

213
00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.367
This guy bumped into me.

214
00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:23.998
I did not.
You knocked me down

215
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.283
and tried to grab my briefcase.

216
00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:26.952
Yeah, but it was
an accident, man.

217
00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.119
An accident, really?

218
00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.958
What's going to happen
to this man?

219
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:30.963
We're gonna book him

220
00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:35.172
on assault, attempted robbery
and resisting arrest.

221
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.382
Well done, Winthorpe.

222
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.242
Hey, man, I'm innocent.
This guy bumped into me.

223
00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.348
I was trying to give him
his briefcase back to him.

224
00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.758
Shit, I can't be going to jail

225
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.018
'cause some asswipe ain't
watching where he's going.

226
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.430
Officer, I would like
to press full charges.

227
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.065
People like this are
a menace to decent society.

228
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.193
You're from a broken home,
of course?

229
00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.319
It was broke. So what?

230
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.482
You have a history of
juvenile arrests, I presume?

231
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.993
Drug abuse, reform school,
state prisons and all that?

232
00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:02.199
I ain't talking to this
guy. I want a lawyer.

233
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.535
Is there a lawyer in the house?

234
00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.336
That man is a product
of a poor environment.

235
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:16.627
There's absolutely nothing
wrong with him, I can prove it.

236
00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:20.263
Of course there's
something wrong with him.

237
00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.345
He's a Negro!

238
00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:26.352
Probably been stealing
since he could crawl.

239
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.945
Given the right surroundings
and encouragement,

240
00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:46.490
I'll bet that that man
could run our company

241
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.579
as well as your young Winthorpe.

242
00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:52.872
Are we talking
about a wager, Randolph?

243
00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.874
I suppose you think Winthorpe,

244
00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.112
say if he were to lose his job,

245
00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:00.629
would resort to holding
up people on the streets?

246
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.013
No, I don't think
just losing his job

247
00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.202
would be enough for Winthorpe.

248
00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:08.060
I think we'd have to heap
a little more misfortune

249
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:10.893
on those narrow shoulders.

250
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.524
If he lost his job and his home

251
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.402
and his fiancee and his friends,

252
00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:20.691
if he were somehow disgraced
and arrested by the police

253
00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:23.201
and thrown in jail, even,

254
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:27.160
yes, I'm sure he'd take to
crime like a fish to water.

255
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.872
You'd have to put him in the
wrong surroundings, of course,

256
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.127
with the worst sort of people.

257
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:36.881
I mean real scum, Randolph.

258
00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.008
We've done it before.

259
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:42.045
This time it's in a good cause.

260
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.180
How much do you want to bet?

261
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.216
The usual amount.

262
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:47.758
Why not?

263
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.191
You're so brave, Louis.

264
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:58.479
Someone has to take a stand
against criminals like that.

265
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.021
But he could have killed you.

266
00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:03.783
In such a situation,
you have no time to think.

267
00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.410
Instinct takes over.

268
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:09.072
It's either Kill or be Killed.

269
00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.041
Did Louis tell you
what he did today?

270
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:15.954
Mr. Louis was kind enough

271
00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:22.002
to share this afternoon's
excitement with me, Miss Penelope.

272
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.303
You're so hot-tempered, darling.

273
00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:32.937
I would have groveled on the
ground and begged for mercy.

274
00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.902
I want you, Louis, now.

275
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.826
Coleman.

276
00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:48.872
Sir?

277
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:53.909
I think we'll take our drinks
in the living room, by the fire.

278
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.161
No dessert, sir?

279
00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.955
You have it.

280
00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:01.966
Thank you, sir.

281
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.973
Hello.

282
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:17.311
Oh, hello, Mr. Duke, sir.
A what?

283
00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.940
A scientific experiment.

284
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:26.734
Well, not at all, sir.
No,... It all sounds very

285
00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.114
original.

286
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:33.031
Well, it's your house, sir,
and I work for you.

287
00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:36.701
I shall make
the necessary arrangements.

288
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:40.797
And a very good night
to you, sir.

289
00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.718
What a scumbag.

290
00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:51.054
Mumsy wants to have a party
for us right after New Year's.

291
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:53.718
January 2nd,
is that good for you?

292
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.512
A-okay with me, hon.

293
00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:56.564
Darn nice of her, too.

294
00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.689
Oh, heck.
2nd of January.

295
00:21:58.734 --> 00:21:59.940
Can't do it, boo.

296
00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:00.690
Oh, Louis.

297
00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:03.899
It's the day the crop
reports come out.

298
00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:07.281
What do those stupid
old crop reports

299
00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.612
have to do with Mumsy's party?

300
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:12.074
Well, it's the busiest time of
the year in the office, sugar puff.

301
00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:17.117
It's just not fair. Why can't you
make them do it another day?

302
00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:17.704
Oh, no.

303
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:20.120
The Department of Agriculture
gets those estimates

304
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.082
from all over the country.

305
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:24.590
Pork bellies, soybeans,
frozen orange juice.

306
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:29.095
I suppose I'll just have
to ask Todd to take me.

307
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.214
Now, wait just a minute.
If you think

308
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.634
I'm going to let that playboy...

309
00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:36.394
Just teasing, Winthorpe.

310
00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:38.554
You know something, Witherspoon?

311
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:39.096
What?

312
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:42.483
We are going to make
a great couple.

313
00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:45.941
We're going to
have a great life.

314
00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:48.322
Excuse me, sir.

315
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.367
What is it now, Coleman?

316
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.825
Will you be needing me
any more, this evening, sir?

317
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:58.868
No, I think I have
everything I want.

318
00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:01.035
Good night, sir.

319
00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:12.008
See, I had to keep the dude
under tight surveillance, man.

320
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.326
That's why I'm wearing
these bummy clothes.

321
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.387
I had to make sure
the dude had his payroll

322
00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:16.642
before I made my move.

323
00:23:16.687 --> 00:23:17.768
Tell us how you cut him.

324
00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:19.249
Hey, I ain't cut him
with no knife, man.

325
00:23:19.273 --> 00:23:21.981
But you told me last
night you cut the dude.

326
00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:24.233
It's with these I cut him.

327
00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:26.189
I am a chain belt in kung fu.

328
00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.605
Bruce Lee was my teacher.
Watch this.

329
00:23:51.972 --> 00:23:53.679
That's called the Quart
of Blood technique.

330
00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:57.137
You do that, a quart of blood
will drop out a person's body.

331
00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:58.426
Tell how you beat on the cop.

332
00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.561
Wasn't no cop, man.
It was cops.

333
00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.313
Plural.
Nine, ten cops.

334
00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:03.585
I beat the shit out of ten cops

335
00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:05.086
and had to change
my whole strategy around.

336
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:09.229
Yo, when they brought
you in here and booked you,

337
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:11.318
you was crying like a pussy.

338
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:12.072
Yeah.

339
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.984
That's 'cause as one of the cops
fell, he threw tear gas in my face.

340
00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:16.973
And that's the kind of shit
they use on crowds, man.

341
00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:18.704
And I still walked
in here like a man,

342
00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:20.035
so get out of my face,
all right?

343
00:24:20.084 --> 00:24:21.495
I mean, you beating up on a man,

344
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:22.954
you putting a man
in the hospital.

345
00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:25.415
How come I don't
see no marks on you?

346
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:26.078
Yeah.

347
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.338
'Cause I'm a karate man,
all right?

348
00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:30.967
Karate men bruise on the inside.

349
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.280
They don't show
their weaknesses.

350
00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:33.304
But you don't know that

351
00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:35.463
'cause you're a big Barry
White-looking motherfucker.

352
00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:36.927
Now get off my back, all right?

353
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:38.411
I wish my bitches'd hurry up
and get here.

354
00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:41.177
I ain't got no time to be
sitting inside this cell with you...

355
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.690
Where is your bitches,
Mr. Big-Time Pimp?

356
00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:47.145
Yeah.

357
00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:52.484
Didn't I tell you that the
phone in my limousine is busted

358
00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:55.116
and I can't get in contact
with my bitches?

359
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.367
Yeah, the phone in
the limo is busted.

360
00:24:57.413 --> 00:24:59.996
What are you, ignorant?

361
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:01.309
Hey, look, sit down, all right.

362
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:07.329
It ain't cool being no jive
turkey so close to Thanksgiving.

363
00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:12.292
Hey, now...

364
00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:15.261
You boys don't know what
you're doing, I can see that already.

365
00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:16.658
Do you know who
you're fucking with?

366
00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:19.674
Do you know who
you're fucking with?

367
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:20.967
Back the fuck up.
Back up.

368
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.510
Do you know who
you're fucking with

369
00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:25.646
in cell number 4
on the ninth floor?

370
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:27.773
Billy Ray Valentine?

371
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:28.728
Yes.

372
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.142
Move it.

373
00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:32.402
You made bail.

374
00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:34.276
I did?

375
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:42.538
Where are you going?
What do you think? You crazy?

376
00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:43.197
Get up there.

377
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.457
You don't know who
you're messing with, boy.

378
00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:46.207
You stay still.

379
00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:48.745
May I suggest using
a night stick, Officer?

380
00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.164
Get out of here.

381
00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:19.692
Mr. Valentine?

382
00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:23.951
Could you spare us a moment?

383
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.956
Hey, man,
don't I know you two guys?

384
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.743
Step inside,
nice and warm in here.

385
00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:32.255
Whiskey, all you want.

386
00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:33.539
Hey, look, man, I ain't falling

387
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:34.944
for the same trick twice,
all right?

388
00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:36.279
What you gonna do,
get me in the car

389
00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:37.572
and have me arrested
for stealing it?

390
00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:40.429
Why should we do that,
Mr. Valentine?

391
00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:43.967
We're the ones
who bailed you out.

392
00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:20.545
Say, man, who are y'all?
What y'all want with me?

393
00:27:20.597 --> 00:27:22.258
We want to help you,
Mr. Valentine.

394
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:25.265
My brother and I run
a privately funded program,

395
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.223
to rehabilitate culturally
disadvantaged people.

396
00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:32.982
We'd like to supply you with
a home of your own, a car,

397
00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:36.735
a generous bank account, and
employment with our company.

398
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:41.365
We're going to start you
at $80,000 a year.

399
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:44.903
$80,0007?
Hmm.

400
00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:46.741
Excuse me.

401
00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:52.084
This is a practical joke,
right, bro?

402
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.044
Then these dudes are a
couple of faggots then, huh?

403
00:27:57.342 --> 00:28:00.130
Well, what's my next move, man?

404
00:28:01.013 --> 00:28:03.755
Thank you, you've been helpful.

405
00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:08.760
What about the police
and the payroll?

406
00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:11.554
We've had the charges
dropped, Mr. Valentine.

407
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:12.847
You're a free man, Valentine.

408
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.940
We can stop right now and
you can walk out on us forever.

409
00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:30.369
No. No, I believe
I can hang out

410
00:28:30.417 --> 00:28:32.283
with you fellas
for a little while.

411
00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:34.247
Excellent.
I'm Randolph Duke.

412
00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:35.832
How you doing, Randy.
What's happening?

413
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:37.167
My younger brother, Mortimer.

414
00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:39.674
Hey, Morty! What it
is? How you doing?

415
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:42.676
Billy Ray Valentine, Capricorn.

416
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:46.214
Randy, that's like Randy
Jackson from the Jackson 5, right?

417
00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:48.883
Yes. Yes, I suppose so.

418
00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:50.597
Yeah, yeah.

419
00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:05.571
Here we are, William.

420
00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:08.454
How you doing?

421
00:29:08.497 --> 00:29:12.832
Hey, Randy, Morty.
This is nice. I like this.

422
00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:14.961
William... Billy Ray.

423
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:15.959
William, this is Coleman.

424
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.041
He'll look after
your day-to-day needs.

425
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.672
Can I relieve you of those, sir?

426
00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:23.550
You get a glass, I'll
give you a sip, man.

427
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.882
Perhaps your coat, sir?

428
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:27.137
Yes, this is my coat.

429
00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:29.594
Coleman is here
to take care of you.

430
00:29:29.643 --> 00:29:31.054
He is your servant.

431
00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:32.889
May I take it?
Get out of here, man.

432
00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.805
Valentine very badly wants
to take a hot bath

433
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.019
and to get into
something comfortable.

434
00:29:38.068 --> 00:29:40.309
Don't you, Valentine?

435
00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:45.402
Jacuzzi, sir?

436
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.441
You see, man, I knew
you all was faggots, man.

437
00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:48.450
You'll be Jacuzzi nobody.

438
00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:53.581
It's a whirlpool bath, sir.
I think you'll enjoy it.

439
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.997
Bubbles, man. Say, man,
when I was growing up,

440
00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:06.340
we want a Jacuzzi, we had
to fart in the tub. This is bad.

441
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.018
What's he doing in there?

442
00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.147
He's singing, sir.

443
00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:22.184
They're very musical people,
aren't they?

444
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:26.071
What shall I do
with his clothes, sir?

445
00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.072
Send them to the laundry.

446
00:30:27.117 --> 00:30:29.905
He'll have to have something
to wear back to the ghetto

447
00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:31.739
after I've won our bet.

448
00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:34.530
Well, William,
what do you think?

449
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:35.869
I like it, Randy.
It's very nice.

450
00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:37.186
I like the way
you have the mirrors

451
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.354
and stuff hooked up over there.

452
00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:40.023
It's very pretty. I like
that. I like that mirror.

453
00:30:40.047 --> 00:30:42.379
I don't think he
understands, Randolph.

454
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:44.040
Oh, but, Morty, I do understand.

455
00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:44.923
William.
Yes.

456
00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:47.756
This is your home.
Uh-huh. Right.

457
00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:48.635
It belongs to you.

458
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.921
Yeah, all this is mine. I
like my home. It's very nice.

459
00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:52.201
I have very nice
taste in houses.

460
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:54.967
Everything you see in
this room is yours now.

461
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.055
This is my stuff?

462
00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:57.185
Your own personal property.

463
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.910
Yeah, my own personal
shit. You understand?

464
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.396
This is mine.
Yeah, I like that.

465
00:31:00.442 --> 00:31:02.683
Yeah, you know what I like
most about my place, Randy?

466
00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.088
The curtains, man.
Look at the curtains.

467
00:31:04.112 --> 00:31:06.152
It's beautiful the way
I got this place set up, man.

468
00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:07.734
This is something else.
I like it.

469
00:31:07.783 --> 00:31:09.023
The cabinets and whatnot.

470
00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:10.362
Beautiful.
I suppose you're gonna

471
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.010
just give me this TV
set for free, Randy?

472
00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:14.529
That's right. Everything
in here is mine, huh?

473
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:17.243
Oh, I guess
the stereo's mine free too?

474
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:17.906
Absolutely.

475
00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:18.915
This is too much for me, man.

476
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.813
You know, I can really dig
this, Randy. You know why?

477
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:23.374
This kind of thing
happens to me every week.

478
00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:25.881
This is your house.

479
00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:29.669
These are your
personal possessions.

480
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:32.463
You will only be
stealing from yourself.

481
00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:34.974
Look, first you throw
my ass in jail, right?

482
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:36.474
Then you go and
drive me out here

483
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.830
and start running
some garbage to me

484
00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:40.016
about this is my house,
this is my personal rug.

485
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.648
And then you go and tell me
this is my personal slave too.

486
00:31:42.692 --> 00:31:44.933
I understand how
you feel, William,

487
00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:47.694
but the fact remains,
all this is yours.

488
00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.776
You may do with it
whatever you wish.

489
00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:51.315
This is my stuff
and my place, huh?

490
00:31:51.368 --> 00:31:53.530
I can do what I want
with this stuff, right?

491
00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:54.534
This is my vase here, right?

492
00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:56.991
This is Billy Ray's vase,
right? I own this vase.

493
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.498
And I can play like Harlem
Globetrotters shit with it, right?

494
00:31:59.543 --> 00:32:02.581
Okay, you want Meadowlark
Lemon shit, right?

495
00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:05.775
Hey, man, I'm sorry about that.

496
00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:09.758
Perfectly all right, William,
it was your vase.

497
00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:13.721
That's a cheap vase, man.
That was a fake, right?

498
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:17.429
I think we paid $35,000 for it.

499
00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.342
But I seem to remember

500
00:32:18.395 --> 00:32:22.855
we estimated its value at
$50,000 for the insurance company.

501
00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:25.311
You see, Mortimer?

502
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.900
William has already made us
a profit of $15,000.

503
00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:40.330
You want me to
break something else?

504
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:42.286
No.

505
00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:01.385
Excuse me.

506
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:05.293
I just hope we're
not pushing our luck,

507
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:09.106
using Mr. Beeks for this,
as well as for the crop report.

508
00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.612
We are involved
in a very important

509
00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:14.023
scientific experiment, Mortimer,

510
00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:18.160
and Mr. Beeks has
always proven reliable.

511
00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:58.659
Excuse me. Sorry.

512
00:34:04.417 --> 00:34:07.535
Hello, Todd. Gents.

513
00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:26.395
Gentlemen. There is something
rotten in the Heritage Club.

514
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:29.522
Something that has
never raised its vile head

515
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:34.438
in the 208 years of
the club's history.

516
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.901
There is a thief,

517
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:39.191
and he's sitting here among us.

518
00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.235
Not an ordinary thief
like the man

519
00:34:41.288 --> 00:34:45.577
Winthorpe had the guts
to stand up to yesterday.

520
00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:51.667
No, this man is
a hundred times lower.

521
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:57.085
I'd like to introduce Mr. Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

522
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:06.932
Thank you. I'd like to ask
you gentlemen to all stand up.

523
00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:17.192
I'd like to ask you to place
your left hand on the shoulder

524
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.198
of the man to your left.

525
00:35:25.206 --> 00:35:27.163
I would now ask you

526
00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:28.698
to place your right hand

527
00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:32.165
in the coat pocket of
the member to your right.

528
00:35:32.213 --> 00:35:36.958
And empty the contents of
those pockets onto the table.

529
00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:43.006
Thank you.

530
00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.799
You may sit.

531
00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:59.192
We marked three $50 bills
with red X's.

532
00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:02.449
Less than 10 minutes ago

533
00:36:02.494 --> 00:36:07.739
those bills were stolen
from a coat in the cloakroom.

534
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:11.910
One of our operatives
witnessed the theft.

535
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:45.701
Now, wait a minute. I've never
seen this money before in my life.

536
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:47.361
Randolph, Mortimer,
this is outrageous.

537
00:36:47.414 --> 00:36:51.408
What are you doing? I
haven't done anything wrong.

538
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.416
Oh, Winthorpe.

539
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:56.999
I'm glad your parents
are not alive to see this.

540
00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:00.791
What? No, wait, now this is
totally preposterous. This is insane.

541
00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:04.462
I have no reason to steal.
No, wait, I'm not a thief.

542
00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:06.096
I demand a fair hearing.

543
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:07.506
You can at least grant me that.

544
00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:10.426
Someone planted
that stuff on me.

545
00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:30.366
You realize you're
making a grave mistake.

546
00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:33.373
Boy, are you two
going to be sorry.

547
00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:34.704
Do you know who I am?

548
00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:38.121
Yeah, Winthorpe, Louis Ill.

549
00:37:38.173 --> 00:37:40.335
I know, I know. I'm
permitted two phone calls.

550
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:41.919
Just point me to the phone.

551
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:43.083
Take off your clothes.

552
00:37:43.136 --> 00:37:45.002
Now, wait a minute,
I know my rights.

553
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:47.295
Take off your clothes.

554
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.760
You are making
a career decision here.

555
00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:51.095
Now, you'd better
think about it,

556
00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:54.011
because it's something that
you're going to have to live with

557
00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:54.973
for the rest of your life.

558
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:59.984
Strip, you little shit, before
I tear you a new asshole.

559
00:38:01.821 --> 00:38:04.279
Did you hear what
this man said to me?

560
00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:05.280
Now, I have witnesses.

561
00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:09.034
This man is
physically threatening me.

562
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:12.783
Winthorpe.

563
00:38:12.832 --> 00:38:15.449
Louis III.

564
00:38:15.502 --> 00:38:20.918
All right.
One gold watch.

565
00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:27.260
One alligator skin wallet.

566
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:31.515
Master Charge,
American Express Gold Card.

567
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.099
Visa, Diners Club Carte Blanche.

568
00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:38.642
Two tickets.

569
00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:43.356
La Boheem.
La Boheme. It's an opera.

570
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.067
It's an opera.

571
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:54.950
One cellophane bag.

572
00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:55.739
That's not mine.

573
00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:58.955
I've never seen that
before in my life.

574
00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:04.043
That's PCP, phencyclidine.
Angel dust.

575
00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:06.424
You ever seen
what this stuff does to kids?

576
00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:11.885
You are looking at three
to five, mandatory, Louis.

577
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:30.566
What's happening, Terry?

578
00:39:30.618 --> 00:39:33.986
Give me a bottle
of your best champagne.

579
00:39:35.748 --> 00:39:36.533
You got a lot of nerve,

580
00:39:36.583 --> 00:39:39.541
showing your face around here
after all this time.

581
00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:42.499
Look, man, I got your money.

582
00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:48.964
I got your poor, measly $27
with interest.

583
00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:53.964
Billy Ray, honey.
Is that you?

584
00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:55.178
Who you think it is?

585
00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:57.308
Terence, get the lady
some champagne.

586
00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:59.890
In fact,
champagne for everybody,

587
00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:02.431
courtesy of Billy Ray Valentine.

588
00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:03.769
All right!

589
00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:05.183
All right!

590
00:40:06.905 --> 00:40:09.442
That's sweet of you.

591
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.112
A toast to Billy Ray, huh?

592
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:17.112
Well, I'm a sexy man.

593
00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:17.996
I'm very sexy, see.

594
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:21.124
And people will come and say,
"Billy Ray, you're so sexy,"

595
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:22.785
and not understand my sexuality.

596
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:25.545
I know.
I'm a very sexy...

597
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:31.176
You was in the tank last night,
bragging on your limousine.

598
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.384
You're the motherfucker
I was gonna carve.

599
00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:37.549
Yeah.

600
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:43.142
Motherfucker? Moi?

601
00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:45.432
That just happens to be
my limousine outside.

602
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:48.147
Why don't you go
take a look at it?

603
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:50.688
Right outside?

604
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.277
Yeah.

605
00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:55.158
You took care of him, baby.

606
00:40:55.203 --> 00:40:56.805
I was gonna Kick his ass.
Were you going to?

607
00:40:56.829 --> 00:41:00.663
I should have kicked it,
but I'm a peaceful man.

608
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.799
Look, ladies, it's about
time for me to get home.

609
00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:14.586
But if any of you ladies want to
drop by my house for cocktails,

610
00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:17.882
there's plenty of room
in my limousine.

611
00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:18.594
Limousine!

612
00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:20.759
Come on, everybody.

613
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:45.625
You're looking so fine,
Billy Ray.

614
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.581
Thank you very much.

615
00:41:52.051 --> 00:41:56.591
Hey, yo, cuz, if you gonna
vomit, the bathroom's downstairs.

616
00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:59.222
No, it's downstairs, man.

617
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.551
Shit!

618
00:42:04.313 --> 00:42:06.054
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

619
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:10.567
That's a Persian rug.
It's Persian, from Persia.

620
00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:18.567
Hey. Hey, what is this?

621
00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:19.575
What is this shit here?

622
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:24.456
Hold up! Hey, who's been
putting out their Kools on my floor?

623
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.245
Who has been putting out
their Kools on my floor?

624
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.586
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

625
00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:38.469
Have you people
ever heard of coasters?

626
00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:43.842
Would you like me to prepare
some more hors d'oeuvres

627
00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:46.011
for the guests, sir?

628
00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.350
Fuck them.

629
00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:51.062
Hey, Coleman, there was more
people in this room here before.

630
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:51.724
Where'd they go?

631
00:42:51.778 --> 00:42:56.648
I believe some of them
have adjourned upstairs, sir.

632
00:42:57.116 --> 00:42:59.574
To my bedroom?

633
00:43:00.203 --> 00:43:02.911
I've been waiting
for you, Billy Ray.

634
00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:06.289
Put your clothes on
and get out of here.

635
00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:26.810
Yeah, that's my girl,
right over there.

636
00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:36.277
Can I have everybody's
attention please?

637
00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:44.194
Can I have everybody's
attention please?

638
00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:53.166
Get the fuck out!

639
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:59.589
- Okay, now, see here.
- Good night, sir.

640
00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:00.637
Good night, madam.
Man.

641
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.638
I hope you enjoyed it.
Dude ain't nothing.

642
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.302
Thank you.

643
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:15.521
It was a stone groove, my man.

644
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.731
You are the most righteous...

645
00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:19.020
Yeah, right.
Just get the fuck out, man.

646
00:44:19.073 --> 00:44:21.610
Let's go.
Shit, come on.

647
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.526
Hurry up.

648
00:44:24.704 --> 00:44:29.665
And be quiet out there. My
neighbors are asleep, they work too.

649
00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:35.085
Well, your...

650
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:37.338
Your friends seemed
to enjoy themselves, sir.

651
00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:39.374
I thought it was
a great success.

652
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:40.863
It wasn't no friends
of mine, Coleman.

653
00:44:40.887 --> 00:44:42.072
It was a bunch of freeloaders,

654
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:45.054
treating my house
like it was a goddamn zoo.

655
00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:48.308
Why don't you retire, sir,
and I'll straighten up?

656
00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:51.936
You've got a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

657
00:44:53.149 --> 00:44:56.813
Yeah, yeah, I think I will

658
00:44:58.196 --> 00:45:00.028
retire.

659
00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:03.861
Good night, Coleman.
Thanks, man.

660
00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:12.665
Good night, sir.

661
00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:34.349
Let's go, Winthorpe.

662
00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:48.158
Excuse me.

663
00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:49.990
I'll see you later,
we'll have lunch.

664
00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:53.657
How would you like
to make a fast hundred?

665
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:54.832
I just got out.

666
00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:56.355
Hey, come on.
What are you trying to do,

667
00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:58.746
entrap me right here in the
middle of the police department?

668
00:45:58.798 --> 00:46:00.209
You guys must be
getting desperate.

669
00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:02.545
No, no, no. This is for...

670
00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:31.744
Is that your purse?

671
00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:34.706
Yes.

672
00:46:35.084 --> 00:46:37.621
That's a nice purse.

673
00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:41.295
Thank you.

674
00:46:47.096 --> 00:46:50.430
Darling, I'm so glad to see you.

675
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:53.933
Louis, you're making a scene.

676
00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:56.185
The good news is I'm innocent.

677
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.766
I've never even
done anything vaguely

678
00:46:57.815 --> 00:46:59.681
resembling this.
Really. It's the truth.

679
00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:03.193
Louis, you look awful.
I'm so ashamed.

680
00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:06.901
Those clothes and those shoes

681
00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:09.361
and you've been fighting and...

682
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.027
And you smell.

683
00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:13.577
I smell?

684
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:18.116
Penelope, do you realize
where I've been since yesterday?

685
00:47:18.169 --> 00:47:20.501
They beat me up
and stole my clothes.

686
00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:22.833
Those men wanted
to have sex with me.

687
00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:24.714
Can we discuss this
somewhere else, Louis?

688
00:47:24.759 --> 00:47:27.547
One of them tried
to bend me over this...

689
00:47:27.595 --> 00:47:30.212
I mean, if this
place is indicative

690
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:32.631
of the state of correctional
institutions in this country,

691
00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.424
they might as well let
all the convicts out.

692
00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:35.933
It's far worse on the inside.

693
00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:38.561
Stealing from your friends
at the club, Louis?

694
00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:41.064
Heroin, Louis?
Have you lost your mind?

695
00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:45.067
Mother wants me to call off
the wedding and so does Todd.

696
00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:47.945
Todd? What does Todd have
to do with it?

697
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:49.572
You've been fired
from Duke & Duke.

698
00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:52.905
They're preparing charges
against you for embezzlement.

699
00:47:52.953 --> 00:47:56.992
Embezzlement? I've never
stolen anything in my life.

700
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:58.577
How could the man I loved,

701
00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:00.116
whose children I wanted to have

702
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:02.501
and breastfeed,
be a heroin dealer?

703
00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:05.709
It wasn't heroin, it was
angel dust, PCP, and...

704
00:48:05.758 --> 00:48:09.547
Listen, Penelope,
I swear to you, on my honor,

705
00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:11.802
with almighty God as my witness,

706
00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:15.556
ll am not an angel dust dealer.

707
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:21.684
Oh, Louis.

708
00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.277
I've been looking everywhere
for you, baby. Listen, Louis...

709
00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:31.235
Would you... I'm hurting,
baby. I just need a shot.

710
00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:32.739
Please...
Louis.

711
00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:33.785
Who is this person?

712
00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:37.662
I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

713
00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:40.911
Don't say it, Louis.

714
00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:45.002
Come on, baby, just a dime bag.

715
00:48:45.047 --> 00:48:48.585
I'll do all those things
you like.

716
00:48:49.718 --> 00:48:54.963
You lying, filthy,
disgusting creep.

717
00:48:55.015 --> 00:48:56.255
Todd was right about you.

718
00:48:56.308 --> 00:49:00.176
I never want to see you
again as long as I live.

719
00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:16.159
Grand! Great!
Thanks a lot.

720
00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:18.195
It was a joke.

721
00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:19.641
Your friend said
it would get you off.

722
00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:22.748
You mean, someone
told you to do this to me?

723
00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:25.376
Yeah, and he paid me
a hundred bucks, too.

724
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:27.537
He's right over there.

725
00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:32.004
So let me get this straight,

726
00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:33.542
I'm gonna give you $20
for the cab,

727
00:49:33.596 --> 00:49:35.574
and you're gonna give me $50
when we get to your house?

728
00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:39.341
That is correct. My butler,
Coleman, will give you $50,

729
00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:42.351
and drive you anywhere
in the city you wish to go.

730
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:45.684
You don't exactly look like
the type that has a butler.

731
00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:47.064
You know,
if you're hustling me...

732
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:51.649
Hustling you?
Hustling you?

733
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.950
You don't think they give
these to just anyone, do you?

734
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:58.860
I can charge goods and services

735
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:02.247
in over 86 countries
around the world.

736
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:06.785
Yeah? Well,
I don't take credit cards.

737
00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:19.172
You'll see what
a mistake all this was.

738
00:50:28.817 --> 00:50:29.817
Yes?

739
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.316
Coleman,
could you please let me in?

740
00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:33.069
I'm having trouble with my key.

741
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:35.070
Who are you?
What do you want?

742
00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:36.651
Coleman, just unchain the door

743
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.737
and let me in.
I'm in no mood for jokes.

744
00:50:38.786 --> 00:50:41.995
Coleman?
There's no Coleman here.

745
00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:43.992
You've made a mistake.

746
00:50:51.131 --> 00:50:53.498
Excuse me, for a moment.

747
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:58.387
Coleman! Let me in!

748
00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:03.554
If you don't go away, I shall
be forced to call the police.

749
00:51:15.281 --> 00:51:21.948
Hello. I'll be making a cash
withdrawal for the amount of $500.

750
00:51:21.996 --> 00:51:25.330
Well, in fact,
we'll make it $1,000.

751
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.046
Excuse me.

752
00:51:41.473 --> 00:51:46.639
I'm sorry, Mr. Winthorpe, but
the IRS has frozen your accounts.

753
00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:48.644
What are you talking about?
You know me.

754
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:50.930
You're a heroin dealer,
Mr. Winthorpe.

755
00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:53.395
It wasn't heroin,
it was angel dust, PCP,

756
00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:54.900
and I never even
had my hands on it.

757
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:57.562
Regardless,
it's not the kind of business

758
00:51:57.615 --> 00:52:00.698
we want here at First National.

759
00:52:01.493 --> 00:52:04.656
May I see your
credit cards please?

760
00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:10.746
I've been ordered
to repossess them.

761
00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.283
What?

762
00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:13.920
Now, wait a minute, what
am I supposed to live on?

763
00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:17.207
I mean,
what's going to happen to me?

764
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.546
Roger.

765
00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:34.808
Why is someone deliberately
trying to ruin my life?

766
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.522
Tell you what.
Forget about the $50, okay?

767
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:41.064
I'm just real tired.
I'm going home.

768
00:52:41.742 --> 00:52:44.860
You've got to believe me.
You must believe me.

769
00:52:44.912 --> 00:52:49.247
I have been framed.
You can't just leave me here.

770
00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:52.750
I've got enough problems, Louis.

771
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:58.126
Come on, come on.

772
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:02.844
Listen! Wait! Wait.

773
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:08.304
I have over $150,000
in that bank.

774
00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:13.267
But you don't care because
you helped them do this to me.

775
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:23.231
Get off your knees, Louis.

776
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:33.040
Give me your hand.

777
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:38.208
Soft hands.

778
00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:40.164
And a manicure.

779
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:44.586
You haven't done a hard
day's work in your life, have you?

780
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.683
I'm gonna regret this, but...

781
00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:55.138
Come on. Get in.

782
00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:13.156
I'm going to get to
the bottom of this.

783
00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:16.121
This is about a grave,
grave mistake.

784
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.504
Hey, that look just like
the dude that had me busted.

785
00:54:19.548 --> 00:54:21.459
Sir?

786
00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:23.795
Right there, he looked
just like the mother...

787
00:54:23.844 --> 00:54:28.429
I mean, he looks just like the
gentleman that had me busted.

788
00:54:28.474 --> 00:54:30.431
To whom are you referring, sir?

789
00:54:30.476 --> 00:54:33.810
Right there.
The dude right over there.

790
00:54:34.313 --> 00:54:36.975
Right over there.
That's my car.

791
00:54:37.024 --> 00:54:41.939
Coleman! Coleman,
that's my car!

792
00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:46.231
That's my car!
That's my driver.

793
00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:52.904
There's some strange shit
going on here, Coleman.

794
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:57.325
You don't want to be late
for your first day at work, sir.

795
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:05.461
I mean, what am I supposed
to do in here?

796
00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:06.876
What they want from me?

797
00:55:06.929 --> 00:55:08.419
I'm sure they'll tell you, sir.

798
00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:11.009
Yeah, what if I can't do it?

799
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:12.756
Just be yourself, sir.

800
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:17.555
Whatever happens, they
can't take that away from you.

801
00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:33.781
Excuse me, my name is...

802
00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:35.868
Yes, Mr. Valentine,
they're waiting for you

803
00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:38.749
in the last office
down the hall.

804
00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:04.267
William, my boy.
Right on time.

805
00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:06.356
Come in, come in.

806
00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:11.069
Sit down.

807
00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:16.404
No, thanks, guys. I already
had breakfast this morning.

808
00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:18.288
This is not a meal, Valentine.

809
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:23.453
We are here to try to explain
to you what it is we do here.

810
00:56:23.505 --> 00:56:26.873
We are commodities brokers,
William.

811
00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:29.087
Now, what are commodities?

812
00:56:29.136 --> 00:56:31.924
Commodities are
agricultural products.

813
00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:35.806
Like coffee,
that you had for breakfast.

814
00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:38.388
Wheat, which is used
to make bread.

815
00:56:38.437 --> 00:56:41.725
Pork bellies, which is
used to make bacon,

816
00:56:41.773 --> 00:56:42.808
which you might find

817
00:56:42.858 --> 00:56:46.567
in a bacon and lettuce
and tomato sandwich.

818
00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:49.027
Then there are other commodities

819
00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:52.531
like frozen orange juice
and gold.

820
00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:58.697
Though, of course, gold doesn't
grow on trees like oranges.

821
00:56:59.625 --> 00:57:00.706
Clear so far?

822
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:01.240
Yeah.

823
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:05.503
Good, William. Now, some
of our clients are speculating

824
00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:09.461
that the price of gold
will rise in the future.

825
00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:11.716
And we have other clients
who are speculating

826
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:14.754
that the price of gold
is going to fall.

827
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:17.468
They place their orders with us

828
00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:21.977
and we buy or sell
their gold for them.

829
00:57:22.022 --> 00:57:24.559
Tell him the good part.

830
00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:26.394
The good part, William, is that,

831
00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:31.984
no matter whether our clients
make money or lose money,

832
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:35.491
Duke & Duke get the commissions.

833
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:39.199
Well, what do you think,
Valentine?

834
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:44.250
Well, it sounds to me like you
guys are a couple of bookies.

835
00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:46.956
I told you he'd understand.

836
00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:50.168
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out what happened.

837
00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:53.759
It's the same guy who
tried to rob the payroll.

838
00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:56.262
No doubt about it, that's him.

839
00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:57.762
He planted the drugs on me.

840
00:57:57.808 --> 00:58:00.800
Rahim, Mohammed, Larry.
How you guys doing?

841
00:58:00.852 --> 00:58:01.967
Hey, how you doing?

842
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.387
Hey, how you doing, baby?

843
00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:08.224
You know those people?

844
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.487
He was wearing my Harvard tie.

845
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.781
Can you believe it?
My Harvard tie.

846
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:27.543
Like, oh, sure,
he went to Harvard.

847
00:58:27.796 --> 00:58:31.005
I mean, if he's being
driven around in my car,

848
00:58:31.049 --> 00:58:34.258
he could actually be
living in my house.

849
00:58:34.302 --> 00:58:36.760
Maybe he's even taken my job.

850
00:58:36.805 --> 00:58:37.761
You know, for all I know,

851
00:58:37.806 --> 00:58:41.845
right at this moment he
could be fondling my fiancee.

852
00:58:41.893 --> 00:58:42.893
And Coleman.

853
00:58:42.936 --> 00:58:45.769
After years of service,
this betrayal.

854
00:58:45.814 --> 00:58:48.351
I don't understand it.

855
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.107
There's going to be retribution.

856
00:58:50.152 --> 00:58:51.392
Oh, he's going to pay.

857
00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:53.231
The things that I am going to...

858
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.486
Shut up, Louis.

859
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:55.896
Listen, taxis cost money,

860
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:57.860
food costs money
and rent costs money!

861
00:58:57.909 --> 00:59:02.528
Now, you want me to help
you out, I expect a lot in return.

862
00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:05.615
These were here when I moved in.

863
00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:07.954
Put them on if you want.

864
00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:17.593
Look, I cannot begin to tell
you how much I appreciate this...

865
00:59:18.722 --> 00:59:19.382
Ophelia.

866
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:21.798
Ophelia. You realize that
that's the name...

867
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.536
I know, I know, I know.
Hamlet's girlfriend.

868
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.597
He went crazy,
she killed herself.

869
00:59:25.645 --> 00:59:28.558
This is not Shakespeare, Louis.

870
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:30.306
Look, I'm 24 years old.

871
00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:32.645
I'm from a small, miserable
little mining town

872
00:59:32.694 --> 00:59:34.651
you probably never heard of.

873
00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:37.050
The only thing I've got going for
me in this whole big, wide world

874
00:59:37.074 --> 00:59:42.240
is this body, this face,
and what I got up here.

875
00:59:51.338 --> 00:59:55.957
I don't do drugs
and I don't have a pimp.

876
00:59:57.344 --> 00:59:58.459
This place is a dump,

877
00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:02.471
but it's cheap,
it's clean and it's all mine.

878
01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:06.510
I've saved 42 grand and
it's in T-Bills earning interest.

879
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.848
I figure, I got three
more years on my back.

880
01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:11.480
I'll have enough to retire on.

881
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.395
You're a prostitute?

882
01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:22.237
I'm talking about a
business proposition, Louis.

883
01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.322
I help you get yourself
back on your feet

884
01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:27.284
and you pay me,
in cash, five figures.

885
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:31.621
That's the deal and it's
not subject to negotiation.

886
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.294
Understood?

887
01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:50.135
By the way,

888
01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:54.603
food and rent are not the only
things around here that cost money.

889
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.188
You sleep on the couch.

890
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:01.488
It's hit rock bottom.
Come on, let's buy.

891
01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:03.778
Mortimer Duke here.

892
01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.319
Buy 200 May belly
contracts at 66.8.

893
01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.328
Put them on my personal account.

894
01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:09.283
That's a big mistake, man.

895
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:13.121
Valentine, something very
important is going on here. Just watch.

896
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:16.583
All right, but you all gonna
get reamed on this one.

897
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:19.123
Why shouldn't
we buy now, William?

898
01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.634
Price is going
to keep going down.

899
01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:26.343
Randolph, this isn't Monopoly
money we're playing with.

900
01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:32.353
This is Randolph Duke. Hold
that belly order a moment.

901
01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:34.892
Tell me just why
you think the price

902
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.353
of pork bellies is
going down, William.

903
01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.689
It's Christmastime.
Everybody's uptight.

904
01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.820
Could we please
buy now, Randolph?

905
01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.902
All right, if you want to
lose money, go ahead.

906
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.566
What are you
trying to say, William?

907
01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:49.578
Okay. Pork belly prices have
been dropping all morning.

908
01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.489
Which means everybody's
sitting in their office

909
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.227
and they're waiting for them
to hit rock bottom

910
01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.520
so they can buy cheap
and go long.

911
01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.376
So people that own
the pork belly contracts

912
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.502
are going, "Bad shit."

913
01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.901
'Cause they're thinking, "Hey,
we're losing all our damn money

914
01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.277
"and Christmas is
around the corner.

915
01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:02.820
"And I ain't gonna have
no money to buy my son

916
01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:04.676
"the G.I. Joe with
the kung fu grip," Kay?

917
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.052
"And my wife
ain't gonna wanna...

918
01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.366
"My wife ain't
gonna make love to me

919
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.743
“cause I ain't got
no money," right?

920
01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.383
So they sitting there
and they panicking.

921
01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:11.721
They screaming,
"Sell! Sell!"

922
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.623
'Cause they don't want to
lose all their money, right?

923
01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.249
They out there, panicking
right now. I can feel it.

924
01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.810
They out there. They
panicking. Look at them.

925
01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:21.147
He's right, Mortimer,
my God, look at it.

926
01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:24.029
I'd wait till you get to
about 64, then I'd buy.

927
01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.487
You'll have cleared out
all the suckers by then.

928
01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:30.618
Do you realize how much money
he just saved us?

929
01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:34.373
Money isn't everything,
Randolph.

930
01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:40.295
Advise our clients interested
in bellies to buy at 64.

931
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:44.208
Mr. Valentine
has set the price.

932
01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:49.138
Well done, William.
Very well done.

933
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:53.141
Come on, Randolph,
we're gonna be late.

934
01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:24.130
Yo.

935
01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:27.168
Mortimer dropped his money clip.

936
01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.757
You can count it.
It's all there, all of it.

937
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:30.637
Thank you, William.

938
01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.218
It's all there, man, count it.

939
01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.382
I'm sure it is, William.

940
01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.517
Thank you and
keep up the good work.

941
01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.520
All right, Randy.
All right.

942
01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:41.482

That was great,

That's perfect.

957
01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.489
Witherspoon.

958
01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:44.161
And she stepped on the ball.

959
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:50.217
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.

960
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.262
There you are.

961
01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.923
I think I'm going to be sick.

962
01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:59.639
Don't worry, I'll
handle this, pookums.

963
01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.604
Todd, Harry, Andrew, Philip.

964
01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:05.061
I realize this looks
completely awful

965
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.379
but I just wanted to assure you,

966
01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.986
my friends, that I am
completely innocent.

967
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.112
I'm going to fight
this thing till the end.

968
01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.945
Someone is out to get me
and I know who it is.

969
01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:17.327
The important thing is
that I can rely on you,

970
01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:21.240
my friends,
as character witnesses.

971
01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.210
I'm going to be defending myself

972
01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:33.048
and, well, I wondered if
you could see your way clear

973
01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:38.717
to perhaps advance me a
small loan until the hearing.

974
01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:44.355
Frankly, Winthorpe, and I
think I speak for all of us,

975
01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:45.855
I think it shows
incredibly bad taste

976
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.110
for you to come here and
embarrass us all like this.

977
01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:54.440
I believe I'm still
a member of this club.

978
01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:59.074
Nobody wants to buy
your drugs here, Louis.

979
01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.830
Now why don't you just go away?

980
01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:17.046
Burned my fingers, man.

981
01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.092
I beg your pardon?

982
01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:26.521
Man, that watch is so hot,
it's smoking.

983
01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:30.230
Hot? Do you mean
to imply stolen?

984
01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:32.315
I'll give you 50 bucks for it.

985
01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:33.853
50 bucks?

986
01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.523
No, no, no.
This is a Rochefoucauld,

987
01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.317
the thinnest water-resistant
watch in the world.

988
01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:41.157
Singularly unique,
sculptured in design,

989
01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.287
hand-crafted in Switzerland

990
01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.700
and water-resistant
to three atmospheres.

991
01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:48.335
This is the sports watch
of the '80s.

992
01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:52.168
$6,955 retail.

993
01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:53.798
You got a receipt?

994
01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.299
Look, it tells time
simultaneously

995
01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:59.714
in Monte Carlo, Beverly Hills,
London, Paris, Rome and Gstaad.

996
01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:04.977
In Philadelphia,
it's worth 50 bucks.

997
01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.514
Just give me the money.

998
01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:23.078
How much for the gun?

999
01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:30.836
So this snail is standing in front
of the Cadillac salesman, see,

1000
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.917
and he looks up at the salesman

1001
01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:36.550
and he says, "How
much is that Cadillac?"

1002
01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:45.601
The snail says, "I want a big
S put on each door, a big S,

1003
01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:49.513
"and on top of the car,
I want another big S

1004
01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.476
"so everybody can see it."

1005
01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:52.983
So the salesman says, "But
what do you want that for?"

1006
01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:55.394
He says, "Well, you see,
when I drive down the avenue,

1007
01:07:55.446 --> 01:08:01.613
"I want everybody to say
'Look at that S car go.'"

1008
01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:11.126
"Look at
that S car go."

1009
01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.339
I'm considering going long
on April wheat.

1010
01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:23.005
What do you think, Valentine?

1011
01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:25.869
I can think of three
real good reasons

1012
01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:28.476
why you shouldn't do
something like that, Judge.

1013
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:30.011
One, the Russian
wheat harvest isn't

1014
01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.556
going to be as bad
as everybody thinks.

1015
01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.941
And two...

1016
01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.982
And three, judging
from all these jewels

1017
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.341
around your
girlfriend's neck here,

1018
01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.072
I think you'll need every penny

1019
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:44.235
you've got just
to keep her happy.

1020
01:09:23.034 --> 01:09:27.323
103. That's it,
you're staying in bed.

1021
01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.659
The man has moved into my house.

1022
01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.197
He's stolen my job.

1023
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.456
I have to do something.

1024
01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:37.379
Stay here.

1025
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.679
It's 10:00. Here's Johnny.

1026
01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.088
Listen, baby, I'm sorry.

1027
01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:50.054
My mama just came in
from out of town.

1028
01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.686
Can we do it next week?

1029
01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:57.766
Flowers for me?

1030
01:09:57.819 --> 01:10:00.106
Thanks.

1031
01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:05.944
What are you doing?

1032
01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:08.200
You've got company.
Business is business.

1033
01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:09.306
I'll go for a walk or something.

1034
01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:10.991
The fresh air will do me good.

1035
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.997
Lay down.

1036
01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:21.085
I'm sorry you had to
cancel your appointment.

1037
01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:25.343
What are you doing?

1038
01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:43.395
Ophelia, I can't tell you
how good that feels.

1039
01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:45.940
You've been so kind to me.

1040
01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:48.700
I'm just protecting
my investment.

1041
01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.861
That's all.

1042
01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:54.448
Shut up and go to sleep.

1043
01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:09.762
99 and a half.

1044
01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:12.035
You're not getting out of bed,
though, until it's normal.

1045
01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:15.177
I feel fine and I've
inconvenienced you enough.

1046
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:18.347
You have work to do
and so do ll.

1047
01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:20.106
Nobody works on Christmas Eve.

1048
01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.016
I'm gonna go shopping

1049
01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:24.686
and then I'm gonna come back
and make you a nice quiet dinner.

1050
01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.026
Now, read your paper.

1051
01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:43.921
Christmas, huh?

1052
01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:48.005
I'll give him a Christmas
present he'll never forget.

1053
01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.926
William, where've you been?

1054
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:16.840
The party's already begun.

1055
01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:18.620
I have some work to finish
in my office, Mr. Duke.

1056
01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:23.229
It's Christmas Eve and William
wants to keep working, Mortimer.

1057
01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:24.935
I'll think of you in Stockholm,

1058
01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:26.770
when I accept the Nobel Prize.

1059
01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.651
The wager has two parts
as I recall.

1060
01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:32.985
Something about a second
party turning to crime.

1061
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:37.736
Didn't you say you had
some work to do, Valentine?

1062
01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:39.199
Yes sir. I was
wondering about this

1063
01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:42.286
$10,000 check to
Mr. Clarence Beeks.

1064
01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.246
I'll take care of it, Valentine.

1065
01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:45.911
I don't seem to recall
any Clarence Beeks

1066
01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.169
working for the firm,
Mr. Duke.

1067
01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:50.582
It was before you
joined us, Valentine.

1068
01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.217
We did manage to
stay in business

1069
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.219
for 47 years
before your arrival.

1070
01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.973
Have a drink, William.
Merry Christmas.

1071
01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.850
Merry Christmas, Mr. Duke.

1072
01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:02.260
What?
Merry Christmas.

1073
01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:06.523
Oh, oh, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1074
01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:32.716
Just what do you
think you're doing?

1075
01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.091
Randolph! Mortimer!

1076
01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:38.095
Come in here quickly!
I've finally caught him!

1077
01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:41.599
Who are you?

1078
01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.055
I've caught him red-handed.

1079
01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:44.811
Winthorpe, is that you?

1080
01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:46.562
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

1081
01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:48.097
This man is a drug dealer.

1082
01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:50.357
Look. Look,
here in his office drawer,

1083
01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:52.144
he's got all the bad drugs here.

1084
01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:55.188
Marijuana joints,
pills, Quaalude,

1085
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.232
Valium, yellow ones, red ones,

1086
01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:59.901
cocaine grinder, drug needles.

1087
01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.036
He's the pusher, not me.

1088
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.822
Really, I just came in
and caught this man

1089
01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:05.060
planting this stuff in my desk.

1090
01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:07.576
It's obviously some primitive
attempt to try to frame me.

1091
01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:13.465
Frame you? Boy, if that isn't
the pot calling the kettle black.

1092
01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:14.999
This man's obviously a lunatic.

1093
01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:17.384
I'm calling security.

1094
01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:20.551
Put that phone down.

1095
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:24.969
Hello, security,
Merry Christmas.

1096
01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:29.059
You try to rob me,
plant drugs on me.

1097
01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:30.974
You steal my house,
my car, my job.

1098
01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.734
You know, I ought to
Kill him right now.

1099
01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:35.236
Hey, look, man, this is a big
misunderstanding, all right.

1100
01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:36.466
I don't know nothing
about your house

1101
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.592
and your car and
your job, really.

1102
01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.616
Could you put the gun away?
Will you ask the Dukes?

1103
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.822
Put that gun away
at once, Winthorpe.

1104
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.329
Have you lost your mind?

1105
01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:47.198
Freeze, slime ball.

1106
01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.956
I realize this whole experience

1107
01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.212
must have been
rather unsettling for you.

1108
01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:56.249
Winthorpe, don't leave.
We can explain.

1109
01:15:56.302 --> 01:16:00.296
Yeah, you'll be sorry.

1110
01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:06.017
You'll all be very, very sorry.

1111
01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:31.418
Poor, deluded creature. We
caught him pilfering at our club,

1112
01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:35.000
embezzling funds, selling drugs.

1113
01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:38.212
Now he's dressing up
like Santa Claus.

1114
01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:39.964
Very sordid business.

1115
01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:44.131
I can't believe Winthorpe
would fall to pieces like that.

1116
01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:47.346
It's none of my business, but
that guy belongs behind bars.

1117
01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:49.260
He's unemployed, Valentine.

1118
01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:50.553
It's no excuse, Mortimer.

1119
01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.143
He's flat broke,
obviously hungry.

1120
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.479
Oh, but he has money
to buy drugs, right?

1121
01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:57.690
Listen, you can't be soft
on people like that.

1122
01:16:57.738 --> 01:17:00.651
Take it from me.
I know, Randolph.

1123
01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:08.757
Pay up,
Mortimer, I've won the bet.

1124
01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.637
Here, $1.

1125
01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:20.735
We took a perfectly useless
psychopath like Valentine,

1126
01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:25.364
and turned him
into a successful executive.

1127
01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:27.817
And during the same time,

1128
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:31.784
we turned an honest,
hard-working man

1129
01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:37.373
into a violently deranged
would-be Killer.

1130
01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:41.752
Now, what are we going to do
about taking Winthorpe back

1131
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.837
and returning Valentine
to the ghetto?

1132
01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:47.800
I don't want Winthorpe back
after what he's done.

1133
01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:52.968
You mean keep Valentine on
as managing director?

1134
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:54.310
Do you really believe

1135
01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:58.724
I would have a nigger run
our family business, Randolph?

1136
01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.643
Of course not.
Neither would I.

1137
01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:04.983
I do think we should hold off
on switching them back, though.

1138
01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:08.570
Until we get that crop report,
New Year's Eve, don't you?

1139
01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:11.577
Absolutely. No sense
rocking the boat until then.

1140
01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:15.832
If Mr. Beeks does
what we paid him to do,

1141
01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:19.710
we should have
a very happy New Year.

1142
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.588
Indeed.

1143
01:19:39.733 --> 01:19:43.397
Hey, Winthorpe!
Winthorpe!

1144
01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:52.489
Hey.

1145
01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:17.473
Hey, Winthorpe.
Hey, yo, Winthorpe!

1146
01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.889
Winthorpe. Yo.

1147
01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:26.318
Sorry about that.

1148
01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.661
No, no.

1149
01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.497
Hey, taxi!

1150
01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:45.871
Hi, Louis.
Merry Christmas.

1151
01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:49.791
Louis. Louis,
when you get out,

1152
01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.582
I have a big surprise for you.

1153
01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.217
Excuse me.
The door was open...

1154
01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:58.926
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm
looking for a Louis Winthorpe.

1155
01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.214
Does he live here?

1156
01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:03.680
Wait here a minute,
I'll be right back.

1157
01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:10.645
Louis. Louis, it's him.
It's Valentine.

1158
01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:14.987
Louis. Louis.

1159
01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.656
Louis.

1160
01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:24.663
It was close, but he's
going to be all right.

1161
01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:27.040
Now, make sure
he gets plenty of rest.

1162
01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:30.669
And for God's sake,
no excitement.

1163
01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:32.715
Thanks, Doc.
Not at all.

1164
01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.544
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.

1165
01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.925
I'll let myself out, Coleman.
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

1166
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:40.133
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1167
01:23:47.314 --> 01:23:51.182
It was a dream.
I dreamt the whole thing.

1168
01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:53.522
It was just a bad dream.

1169
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:57.188
Good morning, sir.
Merry Christmas.

1170
01:23:57.241 --> 01:24:01.405
Coleman, I had
the most absurd nightmare.

1171
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.820
I was poor and no one liked me.

1172
01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.864
I lost my job, I lost my house.

1173
01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.248
Penelope hated me.

1174
01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:12.662
And it was all because
of this terrible, awful Negro.

1175
01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:15.839
Oh, dear!

1176
01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:19.468
It was the Dukes.
It was the Dukes.

1177
01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.505
You're a dead man, Valentine!

1178
01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:23.389
Look, Louis.

1179
01:24:23.433 --> 01:24:25.720
It was an experiment.

1180
01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:28.727
They used us as
guinea pigs, man.

1181
01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:32.565
Dukes used us as guinea pigs.

1182
01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:35.271
To see how our lives
would turn out.

1183
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.230
They made a bet.

1184
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.066
I'm afraid it's true, sir.

1185
01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:38.855
I believe him, Louis.

1186
01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:44.528
The Dukes ruined
my life over a bet?

1187
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.197
For how much?

1188
01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.665
A dollar.

1189
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.793
$1.

1190
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:57.005
Fine, that's the way
they want it.

1191
01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.967
No problem.

1192
01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.879
You know, you can't
just go around

1193
01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.117
and shoot people in the kneecaps

1194
01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:05.427
with a double-barreled shotgun

1195
01:25:05.475 --> 01:25:08.183
'cause you're pissed at them.

1196
01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:09.092
Why not?

1197
01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:10.807
It's called assault
with a deadly weapon.

1198
01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.096
You get 20 years for that shit.

1199
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:15.267
Listen, do you have
any better ideas?

1200
01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:17.356
Yeah, you know, it occurs to me

1201
01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:18.940
that the best way
you hurt rich people

1202
01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:21.276
is by turning them
into poor people.

1203
01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:25.614
You have to admit, sir, you
didn't like it yourself a bit.

1204
01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:27.573
And now for the news.

1205
01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:28.454
Under heavy security,

1206
01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:31.661
the crop estimates
for next year's orange crop

1207
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.075
are being delivered from Miami

1208
01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:37.087
to the Department of
Agriculture in Washington, DC.

1209
01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:38.543
Louis. Louis, that's him.

1210
01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:41.380
That's the guy who paid
me to talk dirty to you.

1211
01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:42.259
In charge of security

1212
01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:44.966
is Mr. Clarence Beeks,
head of Lyndhurst Security.

1213
01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:46.597
Clarence Beeks!
Clarence Beeks!

1214
01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.119
The Dukes just gave
that guy 10 grand.

1215
01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:51.932
Ten grand? I saw an outlay in
the payroll to him for $50,000.

1216
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.267
Mortimer said
it was for research.

1217
01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:56.227
Yeah, research on
how he can get his hands

1218
01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:57.295
on that top secret crop report

1219
01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:59.777
two days before it goes public.

1220
01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:00.276
My God.

1221
01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:05.567
The Dukes are going to corner
the entire frozen orange juice market.

1222
01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.485
Unless somebody stops them.

1223
01:26:07.537 --> 01:26:09.904
Or beats them to it.

1224
01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:11.447
Eggnog?

1225
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.208
Duke & Duke,
may I ask who's calling?

1226
01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:16.914
Duke & Duke,
I'm afraid he's busy.

1227
01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:18.078
Can you hold please?

1228
01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:18.916
May I help you?

1229
01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:23.254
Just a moment, Mr. Beeks,
I'll put you right through.

1230
01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:34.475
Operation Strange Fruit
proceeding according to plan.

1231
01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:41.020
I anticipate penetration and
acquisition at 2100 tomorrow. Hold on.

1232
01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:42.732
Fuck off!

1233
01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.317
When can we expect delivery?

1234
01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:47.779
I will be leaving DC by train.

1235
01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:49.785
We'll rendezvous at 2400

1236
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:55.291
at the Hilton hotel,
parking level D, section 4.

1237
01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:56.450
That's the orange section.

1238
01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:58.244
Orange, I like that.
Very good.

1239
01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:02.631
The final payment is
due on delivery in cash.

1240
01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:17.433
Jesus, hey!

1241
01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.190
Happy New Year!

1242
01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.554
Ever make it with an ape?

1243
01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:57.220
Harvey, haven't you had
enough to drink?

1244
01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:00.515
Are you kidding, it's not
even New Year's Eve.

1245
01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:03.184
Come here,
kiss this beautiful ape.

1246
01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.022
Come on, give me a little.

1247
01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:06.607
Come on, just a little.

1248
01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:09.944
Harrisburg express.

1249
01:28:10.327 --> 01:28:14.241
Stairway C.

1250
01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.206
What?

1251
01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:20.788
It's my turn to drive.

1252
01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.328
No, it isn't.

1253
01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:24.086
Yes, it is.

1254
01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:25.918
Well, I'm sure you
think it is, but it isn't.

1255
01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.332
No, don't you remember?

1256
01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:30.628
This morning, you drove the
shipment of anchovy paste.

1257
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.011
Yeah, I drove the anchovy paste,

1258
01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:35.721
but you had the videotape
recorders this afternoon.

1259
01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:39.012
Well, I just... I backed
them up about five feet.

1260
01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:41.431
We have to take turns.
Sometimes it's longer,

1261
01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.565
sometimes it's shorter.
It's my turn now.

1262
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.726
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

1263
01:28:45.779 --> 01:28:47.235
No.

1264
01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.531
Merry New Year.

1265
01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.116
Happy New Year.

1266
01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:00.908
In this country,
we say, "Happy New Year."

1267
01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:04.665
Thank you for correcting
my English, which stinks.

1268
01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:10.175
I am Nanga Eboko, exchange
student from Cameroon.

1269
01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.911
Beef jerky time.

1270
01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.668
You want some beef jerky?

1271
01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:45.919
No, please.

1272
01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:47.705
There's plenty, you know.

1273
01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:49.597
This animal's being routed
through to New York.

1274
01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:54.094
Its care and feeding instructions
are on this bill of lading.

1275
01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:54.799
Okay, gotcha.

1276
01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:57.034
Now, I doubt if you'll have
any problems, but if you do,

1277
01:29:57.058 --> 01:30:01.222
there's a tranquillizer gun
in the first-aid kit.

1278
01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.391
Oh, yeah?

1279
01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.023
Say, have you guys
been drinking?

1280
01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:06.772
No, sir. Not us.

1281
01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:10.482
There's enough drunks
on this train already.

1282
01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:16.192
Happy New Year.

1283
01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.451
Oh, that's kind of you, son.

1284
01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:20.703
And a happy New Year
to you, too.

1285
01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:23.161
Could I offer
either of you two gentlemen

1286
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:28.329
a wee jolt of Irish whiskey
to usher in the New Year?

1287
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:30.418
Not for me, pal.

1288
01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:33.959
I do not drink.
It is against my religion.

1289
01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:39.803
I always say, religion's a
fine thing, taken in moderation.

1290
01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:40.716
Beef jerky?

1291
01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:41.829
Oh, no, son,
thank you very much.

1292
01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:45.346
No, it gives me the wind,
something terrible.

1293
01:30:49.027 --> 01:30:52.190
We are moving!
We are moving!

1294
01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:59.068
New York, here we come!

1295
01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:14.084
Come in, my child,
join the party.

1296
01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:17.799
Let me see now, you would
be from Austria. Am I right?

1297
01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:20.885
No, I am Inga from Sweden.

1298
01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:22.174
Sweden?

1299
01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:25.515
But you're wearing lederhosen.

1300
01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:29.273
Ja, for sure, from Sweden.

1301
01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:36.147
Please to help me
with my rucksack.

1302
01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:40.112
Oh yeah, sure, why not?

1303
01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:08.975
I'm hungry, man.

1304
01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:11.015
I have got to get
something more to eat.

1305
01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:16.153
Well, maybe there's some
pretzels in the bar car.

1306
01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:34.918
You're welcome!

1307
01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:47.600
Who is that?

1308
01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:50.307
Open the door, man.

1309
01:32:57.238 --> 01:33:00.321
I'm dressed as
a baggage handler.

1310
01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:02.277
You can imagine
how embarrassed I was

1311
01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.429
when I saw that
there was someone

1312
01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:06.320
at the party with the
same costume I had.

1313
01:33:06.372 --> 01:33:08.204
Monkey? Monkey?

1314
01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:10.911
I'm a fucking gorilla,
you clown!

1315
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:15.663
I certainly hope there's enough
space on the train for me.

1316
01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:19.174
Nanga, Nanga Eboko,
from Cameroon.

1317
01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:22.803
Do you remember me?
It's Lionel Joseph.

1318
01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:27.387
Lionel, from the African
Education Conference, right?

1319
01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:31.224
Yes, aye, man. I was
director of cultural events

1320
01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:32.762
at the Haile Selassie pavilion.

1321
01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:35.774
I remember the pavilion.
We had big fun there.

1322
01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:54.084
Now that we are all here,
we will have a picnic, ja?

1323
01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:54.539
Yeah.

1324
01:33:54.587 --> 01:33:59.252
You will help me get my rucksack
down for the Swedish meatballs.

1325
01:34:03.388 --> 01:34:05.095
Remember the one we did?

1326
01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.140
Yeah.

1327
01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:12.010
The memories.

1328
01:34:12.063 --> 01:34:14.145
All day long I could
tell those stories.

1329
01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:15.976
Those were the good ones, man.

1330
01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:17.481
The good old days, man.

1331
01:34:17.527 --> 01:34:20.189
There you are, sweet pea.

1332
01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:25.740
So the train will be pulling
into Philadelphia soon.

1333
01:34:25.785 --> 01:34:29.653
Will you be getting off at the
City of Brotherly Loves, Mr. Beeks?

1334
01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:32.994
Yeah, I will, but you won't,

1335
01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:35.538
Winthorpe.

1336
01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:36.952
See if this one's empty.

1337
01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:37.836
Hey, back off.

1338
01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:41.624
I'll rip out your eyes
and piss on your brain.

1339
01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:44.543
Excuse me.
You got it.

1340
01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:47.591
All right. On your
feet. Up, let's go.

1341
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.051
Bunch of fucking weirdoes!

1342
01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.411
We're going to
take a little walk.

1343
01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:55.350
And don't try anything funny or
the whore loses a kidney. Let's go.

1344
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.132
No, I'm from Sweden.

1345
01:35:24.177 --> 01:35:24.962
Hey, beat it.

1346
01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:30.222
Hey, I'm King Kong. I'm the
biggest, baddest boy in the jungle.

1347
01:35:30.266 --> 01:35:32.507
Get lost, you maggot.

1348
01:35:32.685 --> 01:35:36.895
Hey, who is that guy,
your father or something?

1349
01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.859
All right, hold it right here.

1350
01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:44.941
Oh, honestly, Beeks.

1351
01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:46.980
This is as far as we go.

1352
01:35:47.033 --> 01:35:48.990
No more cockamamie cigar smoke.

1353
01:35:49.035 --> 01:35:52.278
No more Swedish meatballs
there, tootsie.

1354
01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:55.698
And no more phony Irish whiskey.

1355
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:59.288
No more goddamn jerky beef.

1356
01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:01.457
The party's over.

1357
01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:04.419
The party's over.
Hey, come on.

1358
01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:07.334
What do you mean,
"The party's over"?

1359
01:36:07.387 --> 01:36:10.095
It's not even 10:00,
you dummy.

1360
01:36:10.139 --> 01:36:12.597
Hey, come on.
Loosen up, man.

1361
01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:15.509
It's almost New Year's Eve.

1362
01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:51.174
Hey, look what
happened to me, huh?

1363
01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:03.352
Sometimes, they look so
human, it gives you the creeps.

1364
01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.607
Boy, that other one's
getting kinda horny, ain't he?

1365
01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:11.273
Think we ought to hit him up
with the tranquillizer gun?

1366
01:37:11.326 --> 01:37:14.535
It's New Year's.
Let them have their fun.

1367
01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:20.665
That black one
must be the female.

1368
01:37:37.143 --> 01:37:38.508
Where is he?

1369
01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:42.475
Beeks.
Are you there, Beeks?

1370
01:37:49.113 --> 01:37:51.775
I'm over here.

1371
01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:57.402
That's far enough.

1372
01:37:57.455 --> 01:38:00.538
Did you get the report?

1373
01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:03.575
Let's see the money.

1374
01:38:12.095 --> 01:38:14.632
Okay, toss it over.

1375
01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:29.275
Thank you, Beeks.

1376
01:38:38.037 --> 01:38:42.156
Wonderful news.
Wonderful.

1377
01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:46.247
Beeks, Happy New Year.

1378
01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:00.803
My life savings, sir.
Try not to lose it.

1379
01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:02.246
Lose it? Coleman,
in a couple hours,

1380
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:07.390
you're going to be the richest
butler that ever lived, man.

1381
01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:12.561
I worked real hard
for this, Louis.

1382
01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:15.105
Hope you know what you're doing.

1383
01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:16.944
Thank you, Ophelia.

1384
01:39:16.993 --> 01:39:19.360
What are you doing?

1385
01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:23.120
1031... That's us, Louis.

1386
01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:26.124
En route to New York and Boston.

1387
01:39:29.464 --> 01:39:32.707
Coleman, would you please.

1388
01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:34.544
Thank you.

1389
01:40:12.048 --> 01:40:15.336
I could use a stiff drink.

1390
01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.259
Would you care to join me?

1391
01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:45.362
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

1392
01:40:45.414 --> 01:40:46.529
Wilson.

1393
01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:48.368
Good morning,
Mr. Duke.

1394
01:40:48.417 --> 01:40:50.203
Wilson.

1395
01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.763
Keep the change.

1396
01:41:04.267 --> 01:41:06.099
Think big, think positive.

1397
01:41:06.143 --> 01:41:07.804
Never show any sign of weakness.

1398
01:41:07.853 --> 01:41:09.343
Always go for the throat.

1399
01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:10.762
Buy low, sell high.

1400
01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:12.931
Fear, that's
the other guy's problem.

1401
01:41:12.984 --> 01:41:15.021
Nothing you have
ever experienced

1402
01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:17.151
can prepare you for
the unbridled carnage

1403
01:41:17.196 --> 01:41:18.061
you're about to witness.

1404
01:41:18.114 --> 01:41:19.479
The Super Bowl,
the World Series,

1405
01:41:19.532 --> 01:41:20.897
they don't know
what pressure is.

1406
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:22.511
In this building, it's
either kill or be killed.

1407
01:41:22.535 --> 01:41:24.137
That's right. You make
no friends in the pits

1408
01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:25.556
and you take no prisoners.
No prisoners.

1409
01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:26.890
One minute you're
up half a million

1410
01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:28.058
in soybeans, and the next, boom.

1411
01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:30.915
Your kids don't go to college and
they've repossessed your Bentley.

1412
01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.121
Are you with me?
Yeah.

1413
01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:34.189
We've got to kill the
motherfucker... We've got to kill them.

1414
01:41:34.213 --> 01:41:38.252
We want you to buy as much OJ
as you can, the instant trading starts.

1415
01:41:38.301 --> 01:41:42.841
Don't worry if the price starts
going up, just keep buying.

1416
01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:44.324
But, gentlemen,
they're gonna broadcast

1417
01:41:44.348 --> 01:41:45.784
the crop report in an hour,
what if...

1418
01:41:45.808 --> 01:41:48.846
Let us worry about that, Wilson.

1419
01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:54.309
Yes, sir.

1420
01:41:56.861 --> 01:41:58.693
How's the ulcer, Harry?

1421
01:41:58.738 --> 01:42:02.072
Pretty good.
How's the hypertension?

1422
01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:05.783
Hasn't bothered me in months.

1423
01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:35.309
Let's kick some ass.

1424
01:42:55.795 --> 01:42:58.036
Well, this is it.
The last bastion

1425
01:42:58.089 --> 01:42:59.500
of pure capitalism
left on Earth.

1426
01:42:59.548 --> 01:43:04.042
Here in New York they trade
everything, gold, silver, platinum,

1427
01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:06.962
heating oil, propane,
cocoa and sugar

1428
01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:10.177
and, of course, frozen,
concentrated orange juice.

1429
01:43:10.226 --> 01:43:12.092
Now, the people on the phones
are taking orders

1430
01:43:12.144 --> 01:43:13.851
from brokerage houses
all over the world.

1431
01:43:13.896 --> 01:43:19.733
The runners then hand those
orders to the traders in the pits.

1432
01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:24.524
They're trading
cotton over there.

1433
01:43:24.573 --> 01:43:26.780
And that's the silver pit.

1434
01:43:26.826 --> 01:43:28.178
Now the Dukes' trader
is going to be

1435
01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:29.680
buying like crazy
right from the opening.

1436
01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:31.991
We'll be waiting
until he drives the price up?

1437
01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:34.280
Right. I can't wait
to see his face

1438
01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:37.451
when they broadcast
that genuine crop report.

1439
01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:39.790
OJ trading opens at 9:00.

1440
01:43:39.839 --> 01:43:41.750
Let's go kick some butt.

1441
01:43:41.799 --> 01:43:43.335
Let's go.

1442
01:44:21.255 --> 01:44:23.417
- 102 bid for...
- Sold!

1443
01:44:43.861 --> 01:44:47.604
Hey, hey. The Dukes are
trying to corner the market.

1444
01:44:47.656 --> 01:44:49.943
They know something,
I can feel it.

1445
01:44:49.992 --> 01:44:52.233
Let's get in on it.

1446
01:44:52.661 --> 01:44:54.402
200, taken.

1447
01:44:55.915 --> 01:44:57.121
130.

1448
01:44:57.166 --> 01:44:58.702
200, 200.

1449
01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:00.458
Louis!

1450
01:45:00.503 --> 01:45:02.790
Not yet, almost.

1451
01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:04.078
220, take them.

1452
01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.292
209.

1453
01:45:05.341 --> 01:45:06.752
Yeah, yeah, got them.

1454
01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:09.088
139.

1455
01:45:12.223 --> 01:45:16.182
Now! Sell, 200 April at 142.

1456
01:45:30.282 --> 01:45:32.023
That's not right.

1457
01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:34.192
How can the price be going down?

1458
01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:37.829
Something's wrong.
Where's Wilson?

1459
01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:39.572
Sell, sell, sell.

1460
01:45:39.625 --> 01:45:41.957
What are they doing here?

1461
01:45:42.253 --> 01:45:44.085
They're selling, Mortimer.

1462
01:45:44.129 --> 01:45:46.587
Why, that's ridiculous.

1463
01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:50.299
Unless that crop report...

1464
01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.178
God help us.

1465
01:46:02.523 --> 01:46:06.767
I told you we shouldn't have
committed everything, you asshole.

1466
01:46:06.819 --> 01:46:11.905
We've got to get Wilson
and tell him to sell.

1467
01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:41.260
Ladies and
gentlemen, the Secretary of Agriculture.

1468
01:46:49.528 --> 01:46:55.945
Ladies and gentlemen, the orange
crop estimates for the next year.

1469
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:11.001
After calculating
the estimates from

1470
01:47:11.050 --> 01:47:13.291
various orange-producing states,

1471
01:47:13.344 --> 01:47:16.427
we have concluded the following.

1472
01:47:16.472 --> 01:47:18.054
The cold winter has apparently

1473
01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:21.216
not affected the orange harvest.

1474
01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:30.191
Consumers can expect orange
and orange juice prices to fall...

1475
01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:40.785
Wilson, for Christ's sake, sell.

1476
01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:54.336
Buy them.
Sold!

1477
01:47:54.385 --> 01:47:56.843
Sold!
Sold!

1478
01:47:59.556 --> 01:48:01.092
Selling!

1479
01:48:03.435 --> 01:48:06.018
Selling. Sell.

1480
01:48:06.063 --> 01:48:07.394
Sold!

1481
01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:10.268
36!

1482
01:48:10.567 --> 01:48:12.023
29!

1483
01:48:17.491 --> 01:48:19.698
Selling.

1484
01:48:19.743 --> 01:48:23.987
All right.
I'll buy. 15.

1485
01:48:27.793 --> 01:48:30.751
Wilson, where are you going?

1486
01:48:30.796 --> 01:48:31.285
You idiot.

1487
01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:35.423
Get back in there
at once and sell, sell.

1488
01:48:35.467 --> 01:48:39.927
But I...
I've just... I've...

1489
01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:48.598
5.

1490
01:48:48.647 --> 01:48:50.354
Yeah, 200.
Thank you, brother.

1491
01:48:50.399 --> 01:48:52.265
100.
Yeah, that was 100.

1492
01:48:52.317 --> 01:48:53.712
So did you get the hundred?
I got that.

1493
01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:56.194
Five with you, man, five.
Louis, that was 100 lots.

1494
01:48:56.238 --> 01:48:57.945
Hundred?

1495
01:49:13.338 --> 01:49:16.046
Happy New Year.

1496
01:49:16.592 --> 01:49:18.458
Winthorpe.

1497
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:20.126
Valentine.

1498
01:49:20.179 --> 01:49:22.261
Hey, how'd you all
make out today?

1499
01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:23.592
How could you do this to us,

1500
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.598
after everything
we've done for you?

1501
01:49:26.643 --> 01:49:29.476
Oh, see, I made
Louis a bet here.

1502
01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:31.228
Louis bet me that we
couldn't both get rich

1503
01:49:31.273 --> 01:49:33.435
and put you all in the
poorhouse at the same time.

1504
01:49:33.484 --> 01:49:36.897
He didn't think
we could do it. I won.

1505
01:49:36.945 --> 01:49:39.482
I lost.

1506
01:49:41.033 --> 01:49:41.864
$1.

1507
01:49:41.909 --> 01:49:44.150
Thank you, Louis.

1508
01:49:44.203 --> 01:49:45.318
After you.

1509
01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:47.156
Certainly.

1510
01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:51.578
Margin call, gentlemen.

1511
01:49:51.627 --> 01:49:52.812
Why, you can't expect us to...

1512
01:49:52.836 --> 01:49:54.747
You know the rules of
the exchange, Mr. Duke.

1513
01:49:54.797 --> 01:49:58.882
All accounts to be settled at
the end of the day's trading,

1514
01:49:58.926 --> 01:49:59.757
without exception.

1515
01:49:59.802 --> 01:50:04.763
You know perfectly well, we
don't have $394 million in cash.

1516
01:50:04.807 --> 01:50:05.807
I'm sorry, boys.

1517
01:50:05.849 --> 01:50:08.967
Put the Duke brothers' seats on
the exchange up for sale at once.

1518
01:50:09.019 --> 01:50:13.183
Seize all assets of Duke &
Duke commodities brokers,

1519
01:50:13.232 --> 01:50:14.848
as well as all personal holdings

1520
01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.766
of Randolph and Mortimer Duke.

1521
01:50:16.819 --> 01:50:19.777
My God, we're ruined.

1522
01:50:19.822 --> 01:50:23.781
This is an outrage.
I demand an investigation.

1523
01:50:23.826 --> 01:50:24.691
You can't sell our seats.

1524
01:50:24.743 --> 01:50:27.952
A Duke has been sitting on this
exchange since it was founded.

1525
01:50:27.996 --> 01:50:30.533
We founded this exchange.
It's ours.

1526
01:50:30.582 --> 01:50:32.914
It belongs to us.
My God.

1527
01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.827
Mortimer, your brother's not well.
We'd better call an ambulance.

1528
01:50:35.879 --> 01:50:37.711
Fuck him!
Now you listen to me.

1529
01:50:37.756 --> 01:50:39.713
I want trading reopened,
right now.

1530
01:50:39.758 --> 01:50:41.499
Get those brokers back in here!

1531
01:50:41.552 --> 01:50:43.543
Turn those machines back on!

1532
01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:47.509
Turn those machines back on!

1533
01:50:50.727 --> 01:50:54.766
You and your Nobel Prize,
you idiot!

1534
01:50:54.815 --> 01:50:55.976
Where's Beeks?

1535
01:50:56.024 --> 01:50:58.766
Where in hell is Beeks?

1536
01:50:58.819 --> 01:50:59.650
Beeks!

1537
01:50:59.695 --> 01:51:01.982
Yeah, I forgot
all about that guy.

1538
01:51:10.581 --> 01:51:12.663
Okay, one male gorilla.

1539
01:51:12.708 --> 01:51:13.493
Hey, wait a minute.

1540
01:51:13.542 --> 01:51:15.124
There's two of them
in that cage.

1541
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:16.955
One gorilla, two gorillas.
Big deal.

1542
01:51:17.004 --> 01:51:19.211
The whole bunch is
getting sent back to Africa.

1543
01:51:19.256 --> 01:51:21.213
It's a big
scientific experiment.

1544
01:51:21.258 --> 01:51:21.998
What do I know?

1545
01:51:22.050 --> 01:51:24.758
Anyway, take a look,
they're in love.

1546
01:51:45.032 --> 01:51:46.818
Hey, Coleman!

1547
01:51:46.867 --> 01:51:48.357
Yes?

1548
01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:50.280
What shall we do about lunch?

1549
