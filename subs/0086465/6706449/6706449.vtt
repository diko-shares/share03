1
00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.448
Your breakfast, sir.

2
00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:18.259
Pork bellies.

3
00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:23.097
I have a hunch something very exciting
is going to happen

4
00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:24.933
in the pork belly market this morning.

5
00:04:38.614 --> 00:04:41.783
Will Miss Penelope be dining
with you this evening, sir?

6
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.535
Yes. Yes, she will.

7
00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:29.580
- Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning, Folsey.

8
00:05:39.508 --> 00:05:41.801
- Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning.

9
00:05:41.927 --> 00:05:44.012
- Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning.

10
00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:47.432
- Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning.

11
00:05:47.516 --> 00:05:48.683
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

12
00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:50.852
- Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning.

13
00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.980
- Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

14
00:05:54.064 --> 00:05:55.565
Good morning.

15
00:05:56.775 --> 00:05:59.402
- Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning.

16
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.407
- Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
- Morning.

17
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.096
Pork bellies. I knew it. I knew it!

18
00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.574
- Good morning, Mr. Duke.
- Good morning, Mr. Duke.

19
00:06:48.202 --> 00:06:50.828
- Good morning, Mr. Duke.
- Morning, Mr. Duke.

20
00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:52.997
- Good morning, Mr. Duke.
- Good morning, Mr. Duke.

21
00:06:57.252 --> 00:06:59.170
Good morning, Mr. Duke.

22
00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:33.621
When do we sell?

23
00:07:33.705 --> 00:07:37.125
I just cannot believe
how stupid these scientists are.

24
00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:38.918
"The eternal question. "

25
00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:41.045
There is no question.
The answer's obvious.

26
00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:44.590
I don't care
about heredity versus environment.

27
00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:46.843
In fact, I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

28
00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:49.053
I care about how much money
we can get for our pork bellies.

29
00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:51.973
Winthorpe put in a sell order
for 76 and a quarter.

30
00:07:52.057 --> 00:07:54.350
His charts say
that's as high as it's gonna go.

31
00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:57.270
It'll never get that high. Let's sell now.

32
00:07:57.354 --> 00:08:00.398
Patience, Mortimer.
Let's see if Winthorpe's right.

33
00:08:02.317 --> 00:08:05.778
Winthorpe's wrong. It's topped out.
I say we sell now.

34
00:08:05.863 --> 00:08:07.738
Just another few seconds.

35
00:08:07.823 --> 00:08:10.575
The market's closing.
We won't get the order in.

36
00:08:28.886 --> 00:08:33.806
We just made an extra $347,000.

37
00:08:35.475 --> 00:08:36.809
Get me Winthorpe.

38
00:08:36.894 --> 00:08:40.229
Well, of course I never had an instant
of doubt in my mind, Mortimer.

39
00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:44.567
Oh, yes, I'm sure a lot of people
went belly-up on that one.

40
00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:46.944
I'll see you at the club.

41
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:18.976
Morning, Mr. Duke.

42
00:09:19.061 --> 00:09:22.480
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Thank you very much.

43
00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:25.524
Vietnam did this to me,
but I'm not bitter, thank you.

44
00:09:26.068 --> 00:09:29.153
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah?
Yeah, how're you doing?

45
00:09:29.196 --> 00:09:30.655
Spare a poor war veteran
some change?

46
00:09:30.739 --> 00:09:31.989
I'm on my knees for life.

47
00:09:32.032 --> 00:09:34.158
I have no money to give you.

48
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:39.163
Please, anything. A quarter.
Anything, just a couple of dollars.

49
00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:44.210
Anything, a quarter, a nickel, please.
Hey, man, I really don't appreciate this.

50
00:09:44.294 --> 00:09:48.339
I don't care what it is.
Smoked ham, anything. Some crackers.

51
00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:51.509
Thanks a lot.
How'd you like a stump up your ass?

52
00:09:51.635 --> 00:09:53.344
Stay out of here!

53
00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:55.179
You got a lot of soul. I appreciate it.

54
00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:02.019
Listen to this.

55
00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:04.772
"Expect this stagnation to continue

56
00:10:04.856 --> 00:10:09.193
"until the Department of Agriculture's
January crop report. "

57
00:10:09.444 --> 00:10:12.697
Exactly as we thought, Randolph.

58
00:10:13.031 --> 00:10:16.117
Wrong. Quite wrong. Untrue.

59
00:10:16.994 --> 00:10:19.870
They've given this genetics fellow
the Nobel Prize.

60
00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:22.915
The man doesn't know
the first thing about human nature.

61
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.044
Randolph. We're about to make
millions of dollars in frozen orange juice

62
00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:29.171
and you're talking to me
about human nature.

63
00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:31.132
Money isn't everything, Mortimer.

64
00:10:31.216 --> 00:10:32.550
Oh, grow up.

65
00:10:32.634 --> 00:10:34.719
Mother always said you were greedy.

66
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:36.637
She meant it as a compliment.

67
00:10:43.353 --> 00:10:46.397
Ezra, right on time.

68
00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:50.568
I'll bet you thought
I'd forgotten your Christmas bonus.

69
00:10:51.445 --> 00:10:53.446
There you are.

70
00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:57.950
$5. Maybe I'll go to the movies

71
00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.785
by myself.

72
00:11:00.662 --> 00:11:02.705
Half of it is from me.

73
00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:05.583
Thank you, Mr. Mortimer.

74
00:11:17.471 --> 00:11:19.263
Gentlemen.

75
00:11:19.348 --> 00:11:20.806
Looking good, Louis.

76
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:22.308
Feeling good, Todd.

77
00:11:22.392 --> 00:11:26.062
We need a fourth for squash today,
Louis. Are you interested?

78
00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:29.732
No can do. I'll be having dinner
with Penelope tonight.

79
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.109
Oh, lucky you.

80
00:11:33.028 --> 00:11:35.571
It's not luck. Todd.

81
00:11:45.874 --> 00:11:47.875
Randolph, Mortimer.

82
00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:50.294
Winthorpe, my boy,
what have you got for us?

83
00:11:50.337 --> 00:11:52.546
Well, it's that time of the month again.

84
00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:56.133
Payroll checks for our employees,
which require your signatures.

85
00:11:56.968 --> 00:11:59.720
And no forgetting to sign the big ones.

86
00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:03.724
We seem to be paying some
of our employees an awful lot of money.

87
00:12:03.809 --> 00:12:06.519
Can't get around
the old minimum wage, Mortimer.

88
00:12:12.734 --> 00:12:19.407
$50,000 to Clarence Beeks!
Who the hell...

89
00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:22.326
I meant to ask you about that.

90
00:12:22.411 --> 00:12:25.830
I went through personal records
thoroughly and there doesn't seem to be

91
00:12:25.872 --> 00:12:28.249
a Clarence Beeks
employed with the firm.

92
00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:33.337
Clarence Beeks. Oh, yes, of course.

93
00:12:33.422 --> 00:12:36.841
He's doing something top secret for us.

94
00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:38.300
Research.

95
00:12:40.137 --> 00:12:41.887
How is Penelope?

96
00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:43.889
Never forget
she's our grandniece, Winthorpe.

97
00:12:43.974 --> 00:12:45.766
You'd better make
an honest woman of her.

98
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:47.351
Well, I'll certainly try, sir.

99
00:12:47.436 --> 00:12:49.812
Actually, the wedding invitations
go out this week.

100
00:12:49.855 --> 00:12:52.148
Good. Good work, Winthorpe.

101
00:12:54.067 --> 00:12:56.110
Don't worry about this, Winthorpe.

102
00:12:56.194 --> 00:12:59.113
I'll take care of this one personally.

103
00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:04.785
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.

104
00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:18.591
Winthorpe is a very steady young man.

105
00:13:19.384 --> 00:13:21.677
We're lucky to have him
managing our firm for us.

106
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.682
Oh, hogwash. Exeter, Harvard,
he's the product of good environment.

107
00:13:26.933 --> 00:13:29.351
It's got nothing to do with environment.

108
00:13:29.978 --> 00:13:31.645
With his genes,
you could put Winthorpe anywhere

109
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.063
and he's gonna come out on top.

110
00:13:33.106 --> 00:13:35.441
Breeding, Randolph,
same as in race horses.

111
00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:36.859
It's in the blood.

112
00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:49.079
Hey, baby, what's happening?
How you doing?

113
00:13:49.164 --> 00:13:52.750
Once you have a man with no legs,
you never go back, baby.

114
00:13:53.293 --> 00:13:56.253
I know what you're thinking.
You seen Porgy and Bess?

115
00:13:56.796 --> 00:13:59.340
We can make it, baby. Me and you.

116
00:14:00.926 --> 00:14:02.009
You bitch!

117
00:14:15.232 --> 00:14:16.774
Who's that? Who's there?
What you want?

118
00:14:16.858 --> 00:14:18.859
Police. We've had some complaints

119
00:14:18.944 --> 00:14:22.571
about con men
pretending to be blind and crippled.

120
00:14:22.614 --> 00:14:23.739
Oh, I'd love to help you, man,

121
00:14:23.782 --> 00:14:25.616
but I ain't seen nothing
since I stepped on that landmine

122
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.494
in Vietcong back in '72.
It was rough, very painful.

123
00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:30.955
You were in Nam? So were we. Where?

124
00:14:32.415 --> 00:14:35.417
I was in Sang Bang, Dang Gong.

125
00:14:35.502 --> 00:14:38.671
I was all over that place,
basically a lot of places, a lot of places.

126
00:14:38.755 --> 00:14:40.339
What unit were you in?

127
00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.216
I was with the Green Berets,

128
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.886
Special Unit Battalion's
Commando Airborne Tactics

129
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:48.639
Specialist Tactics Unit Battalion.

130
00:14:48.682 --> 00:14:49.848
Yeah, it was real hush-hush.

131
00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:52.142
I was Agent Orange.
That was my name, Agent Orange.

132
00:14:52.185 --> 00:14:53.727
Special Agent Orange, that was me.

133
00:14:53.812 --> 00:14:55.813
Airborne, huh?

134
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:08.325
I can see! I can see!

135
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.327
I have... I have legs.

136
00:15:10.412 --> 00:15:14.206
I have... Oh shit, look at this.
Man! I can walk.

137
00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:17.543
Jesus, praise Jesus.

138
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:21.338
I appreciate this. Oh, this is beautiful.
I can't believe... Thank you.

139
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:23.674
I just don't know what to do. It's...

140
00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:27.511
Glory be to God. Praise Jesus.
Look at me.

141
00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:30.055
This is too much. I can't believe it.

142
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.308
You're beautiful.
Listen, I can't thank you.

143
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.685
First Moses, now this. God, Jesus...

144
00:15:34.811 --> 00:15:37.146
Oh, baby, look at me.

145
00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:40.232
I'm so happy. Oh, God.
Look at me, this is too much.

146
00:15:40.317 --> 00:15:42.776
What a happy day. What a happy day!

147
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:45.696
Really, I appreciate it, y'all.
Okay now. All right. Look at this.

148
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.700
I can walk. I don't know what to say.
I'll be all right. Take it easy.

149
00:15:50.035 --> 00:15:53.245
You're beautiful,
both of you all, the two of you.

150
00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:03.505
How're you doing?

151
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.390
- Oh, I'm sorry about that, man.
- Stop, thief.

152
00:16:13.475 --> 00:16:16.101
- Help, help!
- What are you talking about, man?

153
00:16:16.186 --> 00:16:19.855
Don't shoot. Take it, take it.
Please don't kill me. I'm getting married.

154
00:16:19.898 --> 00:16:23.192
- Hey, I don't want your bag, man.
- Help! Help!

155
00:16:24.402 --> 00:16:25.569
Help! Help!

156
00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:28.238
Help!

157
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:30.699
He's in there. After him.

158
00:16:35.622 --> 00:16:38.957
- Excuse me.
- Watch out. He probably has a weapon.

159
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.588
Stop him. He has my briefcase.
Stop him! Stop him!

160
00:16:44.923 --> 00:16:47.091
He's inside. That boy's crazy.

161
00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:48.967
- He's escaping. Get him.
- Shit.

162
00:16:49.469 --> 00:16:51.303
- Look at him.
- Get out of the way.

163
00:16:51.388 --> 00:16:53.389
Get him. He's getting away.

164
00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:55.432
There he is. That's him.
Get him. Get him.

165
00:16:55.517 --> 00:16:57.601
He's under the table.
Somebody go under there.

166
00:16:57.644 --> 00:16:58.852
Somebody get down there.

167
00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:01.230
Right there. Right there. There he is.

168
00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.652
Is there a problem, officers?

169
00:17:15.286 --> 00:17:17.663
What in heaven's name
is going on here?

170
00:17:17.747 --> 00:17:20.833
He tried to rob the payroll, Randolph.
He attacked me in broad daylight.

171
00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:23.043
I didn't do nothing, man.
This guy bumped into me.

172
00:17:23.128 --> 00:17:25.921
I did not. You knocked me down
and tried to grab my briefcase.

173
00:17:25.964 --> 00:17:28.924
- Yeah, but it was an accident, man.
- An accident, really?

174
00:17:28.967 --> 00:17:30.467
What's going to happen to this man?

175
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.635
We're gonna book him

176
00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:34.930
on assault, attempted robbery
and resisting arrest.

177
00:17:35.473 --> 00:17:37.182
Well done, Winthorpe.

178
00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:39.101
Hey, man, I'm innocent.
This guy bumped into me.

179
00:17:39.144 --> 00:17:41.270
I was trying to give him his briefcase
back to him.

180
00:17:41.312 --> 00:17:42.354
Shit, I can't be going to jail

181
00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:44.273
'cause some asswipe ain't watching
where he's going.

182
00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:47.151
Officer, I would like to press
full charges.

183
00:17:47.235 --> 00:17:49.987
People like this are
a menace to decent society.

184
00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:52.531
You're from a broken home, of course?

185
00:17:53.074 --> 00:17:54.825
It was broke. So what?

186
00:17:54.868 --> 00:17:57.745
You have a history of juvenile arrests,
I presume?

187
00:17:57.829 --> 00:18:01.123
Drug abuse, reform school,
state prisons and all that?

188
00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:03.041
I ain't talking to this guy.
I want a lawyer.

189
00:18:03.126 --> 00:18:05.127
Is there a lawyer in the house?

190
00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:14.636
That man is a product
of a poor environment.

191
00:18:14.763 --> 00:18:17.431
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with him, I can prove it.

192
00:18:17.515 --> 00:18:20.559
Of course there's
something wrong with him.

193
00:18:20.643 --> 00:18:22.686
He's a Negro!

194
00:18:23.396 --> 00:18:26.190
Probably been stealing
since he could crawl.

195
00:18:40.246 --> 00:18:43.707
Given the right surroundings
and encouragement,

196
00:18:44.209 --> 00:18:47.044
I'll bet that that man could run
our company

197
00:18:47.128 --> 00:18:49.505
as well as your young Winthorpe.

198
00:18:49.881 --> 00:18:52.841
Are we talking
about a wager, Randolph?

199
00:18:54.594 --> 00:18:58.388
I suppose you think Winthorpe,
say if he were to lose his job,

200
00:18:58.431 --> 00:19:01.391
would resort to holding up people
on the streets?

201
00:19:01.476 --> 00:19:04.937
No, I don't think just losing his job
would be enough for Winthorpe.

202
00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:10.943
I think we'd have to heap a little more
misfortune on those narrow shoulders.

203
00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:16.740
If he lost his job and his home
and his fiancée and his friends,

204
00:19:17.242 --> 00:19:20.911
if he were somehow disgraced
and arrested by the police

205
00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:22.996
and thrown in jail, even,

206
00:19:24.415 --> 00:19:28.252
yes, I'm sure he'd take to crime
like a fish to water.

207
00:19:28.837 --> 00:19:31.421
You'd have to put him
in the wrong surroundings, of course,

208
00:19:31.464 --> 00:19:33.757
with the worst sort of people.

209
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.427
I mean real scum, Randolph.

210
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.471
We've done it before.

211
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:42.558
This time it's in a good cause.

212
00:19:42.892 --> 00:19:44.893
How much do you want to bet?

213
00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:47.479
- The usual amount.
- Why not?

214
00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:56.280
You're so brave, Louis.

215
00:19:56.364 --> 00:19:59.032
Someone has to take a stand
against criminals like that.

216
00:19:59.117 --> 00:20:01.034
But he could have killed you.

217
00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:04.162
In such a situation,
you have no time to think.

218
00:20:04.247 --> 00:20:08.792
Instinct takes over.
It's either kill or be killed.

219
00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:15.340
Did Louis tell you what he did today?

220
00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:17.301
Mr. Louis was kind enough

221
00:20:17.385 --> 00:20:21.722
to share this afternoon's excitement
with me, Miss Penelope.

222
00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:27.060
You're so hot-tempered, darling.

223
00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:32.608
I would have groveled on the ground
and begged for mercy.

224
00:20:40.366 --> 00:20:42.576
I want you, Louis, now.

225
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:48.832
- Coleman.
- Sir?

226
00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:53.587
I think we'll take our drinks
in the living room, by the fire.

227
00:20:54.714 --> 00:20:56.715
No dessert, sir?

228
00:20:57.175 --> 00:20:58.634
You have it.

229
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.137
Thank you, sir.

230
00:21:10.813 --> 00:21:12.731
Hello.

231
00:21:13.483 --> 00:21:17.069
Oh, hello, Mr. Duke, sir. A what?

232
00:21:19.197 --> 00:21:21.490
A scientific experiment.

233
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:26.370
Well, not at all, sir. No, I...
It all sounds very

234
00:21:27.288 --> 00:21:29.206
original.

235
00:21:30.249 --> 00:21:33.377
Well, it's your house, sir,
and I work for you.

236
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.296
I shall make
the necessary arrangements.

237
00:21:37.882 --> 00:21:40.425
And a very good night to you, sir.

238
00:21:44.514 --> 00:21:46.515
What a scumbag.

239
00:21:47.934 --> 00:21:51.728
Mumsy wants to have a party for us
right after New Year's.

240
00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:54.022
January 2nd, is that good for you?

241
00:21:54.065 --> 00:21:57.067
A- okay with me, hon.
Darn nice of her, too.

242
00:21:57.235 --> 00:22:00.237
Oh, heck. 2nd of January.
Can't do it, boo.

243
00:22:00.321 --> 00:22:03.573
- Oh, Louis.
- It's the day the crop reports come out.

244
00:22:05.451 --> 00:22:09.830
What do those stupid old crop reports
have to do with Mumsy's party?

245
00:22:09.914 --> 00:22:12.958
Well, it's the busiest time of the year
in the office, sugar puff.

246
00:22:13.418 --> 00:22:17.379
It's just not fair. Why can't you
make them do it another day?

247
00:22:17.422 --> 00:22:18.630
Oh, no.

248
00:22:18.715 --> 00:22:20.382
The Department of Agriculture
gets those estimates

249
00:22:20.425 --> 00:22:21.967
from all over the country.

250
00:22:22.051 --> 00:22:25.929
Pork bellies, soybeans,
frozen orange juice.

251
00:22:25.972 --> 00:22:28.765
I suppose
I'll just have to ask Todd to take me.

252
00:22:29.934 --> 00:22:33.854
Now, wait just a minute. If you think
I'm going to let that playboy...

253
00:22:33.938 --> 00:22:36.398
Just teasing, Winthorpe.

254
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.735
- You know something, Witherspoon?
- What?

255
00:22:39.777 --> 00:22:43.238
We are going to make a great couple.

256
00:22:43.281 --> 00:22:45.615
We're going to have a great life.

257
00:22:47.452 --> 00:22:50.245
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it now, Coleman?

258
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.041
Will you be needing me any more,
this evening, sir?

259
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.879
No, I think I have everything I want.

260
00:22:59.047 --> 00:23:00.589
Good night, sir.

261
00:23:10.767 --> 00:23:12.559
See, I had to keep the dude
under tight surveillance, man.

262
00:23:12.643 --> 00:23:14.061
That's why I'm wearing
these bummy clothes.

263
00:23:14.145 --> 00:23:15.771
I had to make sure
the dude had his payroll

264
00:23:15.813 --> 00:23:17.147
before I made my move.

265
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.275
- Tell us how you cut him.
- Hey, I ain't cut him with no knife, man.

266
00:23:20.318 --> 00:23:22.527
But you told me last night
you cut the dude.

267
00:23:22.612 --> 00:23:24.404
It's with these I cut him.

268
00:23:25.073 --> 00:23:28.867
I am a chain belt in kung fu.
Bruce Lee was my teacher. Watch this.

269
00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:54.935
That's called
the Quart of Blood technique.

270
00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:57.813
You do that, a quart of blood will drop
out a person's body.

271
00:23:57.855 --> 00:23:59.314
Tell how you beat on the cop.

272
00:23:59.357 --> 00:24:03.110
Wasn't no cop, man.
It was cops. Plural. Nine, ten cops.

273
00:24:03.194 --> 00:24:04.236
I beat the shit out of ten cops

274
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.695
and had to change
my whole strategy around.

275
00:24:05.738 --> 00:24:09.783
Yo, when they brought you in here
and booked you,

276
00:24:09.867 --> 00:24:12.994
- you was crying like a pussy.
- Yeah.

277
00:24:13.037 --> 00:24:16.206
That's 'cause as one of the cops fell,
he threw tear gas in my face.

278
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.874
And that's the kind of shit
they use on crowds, man.

279
00:24:17.917 --> 00:24:20.544
And I still walked in here like a man,
so get out of my face, all right?

280
00:24:20.628 --> 00:24:23.880
I mean, you beating up on a man,
you putting a man in the hospital.

281
00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:25.799
How come I don't see no marks on you?

282
00:24:25.883 --> 00:24:29.052
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm a karate man, all right?

283
00:24:29.137 --> 00:24:33.223
Karate men bruise on the inside.
They don't show their weaknesses.

284
00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:36.017
But you don't know that 'cause you're
a big Barry White-looking motherfucker.

285
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.228
Now get off my back, all right?

286
00:24:38.312 --> 00:24:39.729
I wish my bitches'd hurry up
and get here.

287
00:24:39.814 --> 00:24:41.857
I ain't got no time to be sitting
inside this cell with you...

288
00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:45.569
Where is your bitches,
Mr. Big-Time Pimp?

289
00:24:45.653 --> 00:24:47.195
Yeah.

290
00:24:49.532 --> 00:24:53.243
Didn't I tell you that the phone
in my limousine is busted

291
00:24:53.327 --> 00:24:55.912
and I can't get in contact
with my bitches?

292
00:24:55.997 --> 00:24:59.499
Yeah, the phone in the limo is busted.
What are you, ignorant?

293
00:25:00.751 --> 00:25:02.127
Hey, look, sit down, all right.

294
00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:07.090
It ain't cool being no jive turkey
so close to Thanksgiving.

295
00:25:10.928 --> 00:25:12.053
Hey, now...

296
00:25:13.931 --> 00:25:16.016
You boys don't know what you're doing,
I can see that already.

297
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.061
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Do you know who you're fucking with?

298
00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:21.730
Back the fuck up. Back up.

299
00:25:21.772 --> 00:25:25.984
Do you know who you're fucking with
in cell number 4 on the ninth floor?

300
00:25:26.068 --> 00:25:28.737
- Billy Ray Valentine?
- Yes.

301
00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:30.071
Move it.

302
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:33.992
- You made bail.
- I did?

303
00:25:40.124 --> 00:25:42.959
Where are you going?
What do you think? You crazy?

304
00:25:43.044 --> 00:25:44.044
Get up there.

305
00:25:44.128 --> 00:25:45.587
You don't know who
you're messing with, boy.

306
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.630
You stay still.

307
00:25:46.714 --> 00:25:48.965
May I suggest using
a night stick, Officer?

308
00:25:49.008 --> 00:25:50.884
Get out of here.

309
00:26:18.037 --> 00:26:19.329
Mr. Valentine?

310
00:26:21.457 --> 00:26:23.583
Could you spare us a moment?

311
00:26:24.835 --> 00:26:26.461
Hey, man, don't I know you two guys?

312
00:26:26.504 --> 00:26:29.005
Step inside, nice and warm in here.

313
00:26:29.048 --> 00:26:32.801
Whiskey, all you want.

314
00:26:32.843 --> 00:26:35.637
Hey, look, man, I ain't falling
for the same trick twice, all right?

315
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.390
What you gonna do, get me in the car
and have me arrested for stealing it?

316
00:26:38.474 --> 00:26:41.184
Why should we do that, Mr. Valentine?

317
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:43.687
We're the ones who bailed you out.

318
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:21.099
Say, man, who are y'all?
What y'all want with me?

319
00:27:21.183 --> 00:27:23.101
We want to help you, Mr. Valentine.

320
00:27:23.185 --> 00:27:26.229
My brother and I run
a privately funded program,

321
00:27:26.272 --> 00:27:29.065
to rehabilitate
culturally disadvantaged people.

322
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.737
We'd like to supply you
with a home of your own, a car,

323
00:27:33.821 --> 00:27:37.574
a generous bank account,
and employment with our company.

324
00:27:37.616 --> 00:27:41.077
We're going to start you
at $80,000 a year.

325
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:44.914
$80,000?

326
00:27:44.999 --> 00:27:46.583
Excuse me.

327
00:27:49.003 --> 00:27:51.755
This is a practical joke, right, bro?

328
00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:56.760
Then these dudes are
a couple of faggots then, huh?

329
00:27:57.845 --> 00:27:59.846
Well, what's my next move, man?

330
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.641
Thank you, you've been helpful.

331
00:28:07.772 --> 00:28:09.689
What about the police and the payroll?

332
00:28:09.774 --> 00:28:12.150
We've had
the charges dropped, Mr. Valentine.

333
00:28:12.234 --> 00:28:14.277
You're a free man, Valentine.

334
00:28:14.362 --> 00:28:17.739
We can stop right now
and you can walk out on us forever.

335
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:32.629
No. No, I believe I can hang out
with you fellas for a little while.

336
00:28:32.713 --> 00:28:35.048
Excellent. I'm Randolph Duke.

337
00:28:35.132 --> 00:28:36.549
How you doing, Randy.
What's happening?

338
00:28:36.634 --> 00:28:40.512
- My younger brother, Mortimer.
- Hey, Morty! What it is? How you doing?

339
00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:43.306
Billy Ray Valentine, Capricorn.

340
00:28:43.974 --> 00:28:46.726
Randy, that's like Randy Jackson
from the Jackson 5, right?

341
00:28:46.811 --> 00:28:49.771
- Yes. Yes, I suppose so.
- Yeah, yeah.

342
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.453
Here we are, William.

343
00:29:07.832 --> 00:29:09.499
How you doing?

344
00:29:09.583 --> 00:29:12.877
Hey, Randy, Morty.
This is nice. I like this.

345
00:29:12.962 --> 00:29:15.380
- William...
- Billy Ray.

346
00:29:15.464 --> 00:29:18.800
William, this is Coleman.
He'll look after your day-to-day needs.

347
00:29:18.843 --> 00:29:20.593
Can I relieve you of those, sir?

348
00:29:20.678 --> 00:29:23.346
You get a glass, I'll give you a sip, man.

349
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.892
- Perhaps your coat, sir?
- Yes, this is my coat.

350
00:29:27.977 --> 00:29:31.062
Coleman is here to take care of you.
He is your servant.

351
00:29:31.856 --> 00:29:33.815
- May I take it?
- Get out of here, man.

352
00:29:33.858 --> 00:29:36.526
Valentine very badly wants
to take a hot bath

353
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.194
and to get into something comfortable.

354
00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:40.113
Don't you, Valentine?

355
00:29:44.243 --> 00:29:46.035
Jacuzzi, sir?

356
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.037
You see, man, I knew
you all was faggots, man.

357
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.706
You'll be Jacuzzi nobody.

358
00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.418
It's a whirlpool bath, sir.
I think you'll enjoy it.

359
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.469
Bubbles, man.
Say, man, when I was growing up,

360
00:30:02.553 --> 00:30:06.139
we want a Jacuzzi,
we had to fart in the tub. This is bad.

361
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.028
- What's he doing in there?
- He's singing, sir.

362
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.489
They're very musical people,
aren't they?

363
00:30:23.115 --> 00:30:27.952
- What shall I do with his clothes, sir?
- Send them to the laundry.

364
00:30:28.037 --> 00:30:30.330
He'll have to have something
to wear back to the ghetto

365
00:30:30.414 --> 00:30:32.040
after I've won our bet.

366
00:30:32.583 --> 00:30:35.126
Well, William, what do you think?

367
00:30:35.211 --> 00:30:36.753
I like it, Randy. It's very nice.

368
00:30:36.837 --> 00:30:38.922
I like the way you have the mirrors
and stuff hooked up over there.

369
00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:40.590
It's very pretty. I like that.
I like that mirror.

370
00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:44.594
- I don't think he understands, Randolph.
- Oh, but, Morty, I do understand.

371
00:30:44.678 --> 00:30:45.803
- William.
- Yes.

372
00:30:45.888 --> 00:30:48.097
- This is your home.
- Right.

373
00:30:48.182 --> 00:30:49.516
It belongs to you.

374
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.851
Yeah, all this is mine. I like my home.
It's very nice.

375
00:30:51.936 --> 00:30:53.269
I have very nice taste in houses.

376
00:30:53.354 --> 00:30:55.271
Everything you see in this room
is yours now.

377
00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:58.024
- This is my stuff?
- Your own personal property.

378
00:30:58.108 --> 00:30:59.776
- Yeah, my own personal shit.
- You understand?

379
00:30:59.818 --> 00:31:01.569
This is mine. Yeah, I like that.

380
00:31:01.612 --> 00:31:03.613
Yeah, you know what I like most
about my place, Randy?

381
00:31:03.697 --> 00:31:05.031
The curtains, man. Look at the curtains.

382
00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:06.824
It's beautiful the way
I got this place set up, man.

383
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:09.577
This is something else. I like it.
The cabinets and whatnot.

384
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.039
Beautiful. I suppose you're gonna
just give me this TV set for free, Randy?

385
00:31:13.123 --> 00:31:15.500
- That's right.
- Everything in here is mine, huh?

386
00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:18.169
- Oh, I guess the stereo's mine free too?
- Absolutely.

387
00:31:18.254 --> 00:31:19.462
This is too much for me, man.

388
00:31:19.547 --> 00:31:21.422
You know, I can really dig this, Randy.
You know why?

389
00:31:21.465 --> 00:31:23.633
This kind of thing happens to me
every week.

390
00:31:23.717 --> 00:31:26.594
This is your house.

391
00:31:26.637 --> 00:31:30.390
These are your personal possessions.

392
00:31:30.516 --> 00:31:33.726
You will only be stealing from yourself.

393
00:31:33.811 --> 00:31:35.937
Look, first you throw
my ass in jail, right?

394
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.648
Then you go and drive me out here
and start running some garbage to me

395
00:31:38.691 --> 00:31:41.192
about this is my house,
this is my personal rug.

396
00:31:41.277 --> 00:31:43.444
And then you go and tell me
this is my personal slave too.

397
00:31:43.487 --> 00:31:48.366
I understand how you feel, William,
but the fact remains, all this is yours.

398
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.660
You may do with it whatever you wish.

399
00:31:50.703 --> 00:31:52.328
This is my stuff and my place, huh?

400
00:31:52.413 --> 00:31:54.163
I can do what I want
with this stuff, right?

401
00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:55.665
This is my vase here, right?

402
00:31:55.749 --> 00:31:58.001
This is Billy Ray's vase, right?
I own this vase.

403
00:31:58.085 --> 00:32:00.295
And I can play like
Harlem Globetrotters shit with it, right?

404
00:32:00.337 --> 00:32:02.338
Okay, you want
Meadowlark Lemon shit, right?

405
00:32:05.551 --> 00:32:06.801
Hey, man, I'm sorry about that.

406
00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:09.637
Perfectly all right, William,
it was your vase.

407
00:32:11.557 --> 00:32:14.267
That's a cheap vase, man.
That was a fake, right?

408
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:17.186
I think we paid $35,000 for it.

409
00:32:18.022 --> 00:32:19.105
But I seem to remember

410
00:32:19.189 --> 00:32:22.942
we estimated its value
at $50,000 for the insurance company.

411
00:32:24.903 --> 00:32:29.782
You see, Mortimer? William has
already made us a profit of $15,000.

412
00:32:39.084 --> 00:32:40.710
You want me to break something else?

413
00:32:40.794 --> 00:32:42.003
No.

414
00:32:59.855 --> 00:33:01.105
Excuse me.

415
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.361
I just hope we're not pushing our luck,

416
00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:09.906
using Mr. Beeks for this,
as well as for the crop report.

417
00:33:09.948 --> 00:33:14.327
We are involved in a very important
scientific experiment, Mortimer,

418
00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:18.247
and Mr. Beeks has always
proven reliable.

419
00:33:56.495 --> 00:33:58.454
Excuse me. Sorry.

420
00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:07.338
Hello, Todd. Gents.

421
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.649
Gentlemen. There is something rotten
in the Heritage Club.

422
00:34:27.484 --> 00:34:30.403
Something that has never raised
its vile head

423
00:34:30.487 --> 00:34:34.198
in the 208 years of the club's history.

424
00:34:35.576 --> 00:34:37.452
There is a thief,

425
00:34:37.494 --> 00:34:39.495
and he's sitting here among us.

426
00:34:39.997 --> 00:34:42.331
Not an ordinary thief like the man

427
00:34:42.374 --> 00:34:46.169
Winthorpe had the guts
to stand up to yesterday.

428
00:34:46.712 --> 00:34:51.466
No, this man is a hundred times lower.

429
00:34:53.677 --> 00:34:57.013
I'd like to introduce Mr. Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

430
00:35:01.894 --> 00:35:06.814
Thank you. I'd like
to ask you gentlemen to all stand up.

431
00:35:14.531 --> 00:35:17.867
I'd like to ask you to place
your left hand on the shoulder

432
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.119
of the man to your left.

433
00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:27.460
I would now ask you

434
00:35:27.544 --> 00:35:29.921
to place your right hand

435
00:35:30.047 --> 00:35:32.757
in the coat pocket
of the member to your right.

436
00:35:33.592 --> 00:35:36.803
And empty the contents
of those pockets onto the table.

437
00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:42.892
Thank you.

438
00:35:43.769 --> 00:35:45.645
You may sit.

439
00:35:55.697 --> 00:35:59.075
We marked three $50 bills with red X's.

440
00:36:01.078 --> 00:36:03.663
Less than 10 minutes ago

441
00:36:03.747 --> 00:36:07.667
those bills were stolen
from a coat in the cloakroom.

442
00:36:08.794 --> 00:36:11.754
One of our operatives
witnessed the theft.

443
00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:46.455
Now, wait a minute. I've never seen
this money before in my life.

444
00:36:46.498 --> 00:36:48.666
Randolph, Mortimer, this is outrageous.

445
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.586
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything wrong.

446
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.963
Oh, Winthorpe.

447
00:36:54.339 --> 00:36:57.383
I'm glad your parents are not
alive to see this.

448
00:36:58.302 --> 00:37:01.637
What? No, wait, now this is
totally preposterous. This is insane.

449
00:37:01.722 --> 00:37:04.765
I have no reason to steal.
No, wait, I'm not a thief.

450
00:37:04.808 --> 00:37:07.977
I demand a fair hearing.
You can at least grant me that.

451
00:37:08.103 --> 00:37:10.146
Someone planted that stuff on me.

452
00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:30.833
You realize you're making
a grave mistake.

453
00:37:30.918 --> 00:37:34.712
Boy, are you two going to be sorry.
Do you know who I am?

454
00:37:34.796 --> 00:37:39.008
Yeah, Winthorpe, Louis lll.

455
00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:40.676
I know, I know.
I'm permitted two phone calls.

456
00:37:40.719 --> 00:37:41.928
Just point me to the phone.

457
00:37:42.012 --> 00:37:45.222
- Take off your clothes.
- Now, wait a minute, I know my rights.

458
00:37:45.307 --> 00:37:47.016
Take off your clothes.

459
00:37:47.935 --> 00:37:51.938
You are making a career decision here.
Now, you'd better think about it,

460
00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:54.065
because it's something
that you're going to have to live with

461
00:37:54.149 --> 00:37:56.192
for the rest of your life.

462
00:37:56.234 --> 00:37:59.362
Strip, you little shit,
before I tear you a new asshole.

463
00:38:02.532 --> 00:38:04.492
Did you hear what this man said to me?

464
00:38:04.534 --> 00:38:08.412
Now, I have witnesses.
This man is physically threatening me.

465
00:38:11.249 --> 00:38:13.125
Winthorpe.

466
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.169
Louis lll.

467
00:38:16.046 --> 00:38:20.549
All right. One gold watch.

468
00:38:23.762 --> 00:38:26.889
One alligator skin wallet.

469
00:38:28.225 --> 00:38:31.310
Master Charge,
American Express Gold Card.

470
00:38:32.729 --> 00:38:35.773
Visa, Diners Club Carte Blanche.

471
00:38:36.858 --> 00:38:38.651
Two tickets.

472
00:38:39.569 --> 00:38:43.114
<i>- La Boheem.
- La Bohème. It's an opera.</i>

473
00:38:44.116 --> 00:38:45.741
It's an opera.

474
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:55.084
One cellophane bag.

475
00:38:55.168 --> 00:38:58.587
That's not mine.
I've never seen that before in my life.

476
00:39:01.425 --> 00:39:05.052
That's PCP, phencyclidine. Angel dust.

477
00:39:05.178 --> 00:39:07.430
You ever seen
what this stuff does to kids?

478
00:39:07.514 --> 00:39:11.892
You are looking at three to five,
mandatory, Louis.

479
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.454
What's happening, Terry?

480
00:39:31.496 --> 00:39:33.789
Give me a bottle
of your best champagne.

481
00:39:36.168 --> 00:39:37.293
You got a lot of nerve,

482
00:39:37.377 --> 00:39:40.212
showing your face around here
after all this time.

483
00:39:40.422 --> 00:39:42.840
Look, man, I got your money.

484
00:39:43.425 --> 00:39:48.763
I got your poor, measly $27
with interest.

485
00:39:51.141 --> 00:39:54.310
Billy Ray, honey. Is that you?

486
00:39:54.394 --> 00:39:58.147
Who you think it is?
Terence, get the lady some champagne.

487
00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:02.651
In fact, champagne for everybody,
courtesy of Billy Ray Valentine.

488
00:40:02.736 --> 00:40:05.488
- All right!
- All right!

489
00:40:07.407 --> 00:40:09.075
That's sweet of you.

490
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.661
A toast to Billy Ray, huh?

491
00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.667
Well, I'm a sexy man.
I'm very sexy, see.

492
00:40:18.752 --> 00:40:21.587
And people will come
and say, "Billy Ray, you're so sexy,"

493
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:23.297
and not understand my sexuality.

494
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.174
- I know.
- I'm a very sexy...

495
00:40:27.052 --> 00:40:31.680
You was in the tank last night,
bragging on your limousine.

496
00:40:32.015 --> 00:40:35.017
You're the motherfucker
I was gonna carve.

497
00:40:35.894 --> 00:40:37.186
Yeah.

498
00:40:40.232 --> 00:40:43.984
Motherfucker? Moi?

499
00:40:44.027 --> 00:40:46.028
That just happens to be
my limousine outside.

500
00:40:46.113 --> 00:40:48.364
Why don't you go take a look at it?

501
00:40:48.448 --> 00:40:50.366
Right outside?

502
00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:52.868
Yeah.

503
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:55.830
You took care of him, baby.

504
00:40:55.872 --> 00:40:57.581
- I was gonna kick his ass.
- Were you going to?

505
00:40:57.666 --> 00:41:00.376
I should have kicked it,
but I'm a peaceful man.

506
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.221
Look, ladies, it's about time
for me to get home.

507
00:41:12.264 --> 00:41:15.391
But if any of you ladies want
to drop by my house for cocktails,

508
00:41:15.433 --> 00:41:17.643
there's plenty of room in my limousine.

509
00:41:17.727 --> 00:41:20.479
- Limousine!
- Come on, everybody.

510
00:41:43.378 --> 00:41:47.256
- You're looking so fine, Billy Ray.
- Thank you very much.

511
00:41:52.846 --> 00:41:56.682
Hey, yo, cuz, if you gonna vomit,
the bathroom's downstairs.

512
00:41:56.766 --> 00:41:58.767
No, it's downstairs, man.

513
00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:02.188
Shit!

514
00:42:04.608 --> 00:42:06.734
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

515
00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:10.196
That's a Persian rug.
It's Persian, from Persia.

516
00:42:17.078 --> 00:42:20.497
Hey. Hey, what is this?
What is this shit here?

517
00:42:20.582 --> 00:42:25.127
Hold up! Hey, who's been
putting out their Kools on my floor?

518
00:42:25.295 --> 00:42:28.797
Who has been putting out
their Kools on my floor?

519
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.346
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

520
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.098
Have you people
ever heard of coasters?

521
00:42:41.561 --> 00:42:45.564
Would you like me to prepare some
more hors d'oeuvres for the guests, sir?

522
00:42:46.316 --> 00:42:47.816
Fuck them.

523
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.195
Hey, Coleman, there was more people
in this room here before.

524
00:42:51.279 --> 00:42:52.571
Where'd they go?

525
00:42:52.656 --> 00:42:56.325
I believe some of them
have adjourned upstairs, sir.

526
00:42:57.327 --> 00:42:59.203
To my bedroom?

527
00:43:00.622 --> 00:43:02.915
I've been waiting for you, Billy Ray.

528
00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:06.252
Put your clothes on and get out of here.

529
00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.480
Yeah, that's my girl, right over there.

530
00:43:33.405 --> 00:43:35.823
Can I have
everybody's attention please?

531
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:43.706
Can I have
everybody's attention please?

532
00:43:50.547 --> 00:43:52.715
Get the fuck out!

533
00:43:57.429 --> 00:43:59.722
- Okay, now, see here.
- Good night, sir.

534
00:43:59.973 --> 00:44:01.390
- Good night, madam.
- Man.

535
00:44:01.474 --> 00:44:03.225
- I hope you enjoyed it.
- Dude ain't nothing.

536
00:44:07.564 --> 00:44:08.856
Thank you.

537
00:44:12.944 --> 00:44:15.904
It was a stone groove, my man.

538
00:44:16.031 --> 00:44:17.573
You are the most righteous...

539
00:44:17.615 --> 00:44:21.243
Yeah, right. Just get the fuck out, man.
Let's go. Shit, come on.

540
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.163
Hurry up.

541
00:44:25.749 --> 00:44:29.251
And be quiet out there.
My neighbors are asleep, they work too.

542
00:44:33.757 --> 00:44:35.591
Well, your...

543
00:44:35.759 --> 00:44:37.801
Your friends seemed
to enjoy themselves, sir.

544
00:44:37.886 --> 00:44:39.803
I thought it was a great success.

545
00:44:39.888 --> 00:44:42.514
It wasn't no friends of mine, Coleman.
It was a bunch of freeloaders,

546
00:44:42.599 --> 00:44:45.601
treating my house
like it was a goddamn zoo.

547
00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:48.854
Why don't you retire, sir,
and I'll straighten up?

548
00:44:49.147 --> 00:44:51.648
You've got a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

549
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:56.445
Yeah, yeah, I think I will

550
00:44:58.406 --> 00:45:00.282
retire.

551
00:45:00.784 --> 00:45:03.535
Good night, Coleman. Thanks, man.

552
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.294
Good night, sir.

553
00:45:31.898 --> 00:45:33.899
Let's go, Winthorpe.

554
00:45:46.871 --> 00:45:50.624
- Excuse me.
- I'll see you later, we'll have lunch.

555
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.293
How would you like to make
a fast hundred?

556
00:45:54.003 --> 00:45:56.004
I just got out.

557
00:45:56.047 --> 00:45:57.214
Hey, come on.
What are you trying to do,

558
00:45:57.298 --> 00:45:59.174
entrap me right here
in the middle of the police department?

559
00:45:59.259 --> 00:46:02.136
- You guys must be getting desperate.
- No, no, no. This is for...

560
00:46:29.956 --> 00:46:31.957
Is that your purse?

561
00:46:33.293 --> 00:46:34.543
Yes.

562
00:46:35.462 --> 00:46:37.463
That's a nice purse.

563
00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:41.049
Thank you.

564
00:46:47.849 --> 00:46:50.476
Darling, I'm so glad to see you.

565
00:46:50.977 --> 00:46:54.104
Louis, you're making a scene.

566
00:46:54.898 --> 00:46:56.815
The good news is I'm innocent.

567
00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.110
I've never even done anything vaguely
resembling this. Really. It's the truth.

568
00:47:00.195 --> 00:47:03.822
Louis, you look awful. I'm so ashamed.

569
00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:06.617
Those clothes and those shoes

570
00:47:07.494 --> 00:47:11.580
and you've been fighting and...
And you smell.

571
00:47:12.665 --> 00:47:14.583
I smell?

572
00:47:14.626 --> 00:47:17.836
Penelope, do you realize
where I've been since yesterday?

573
00:47:18.755 --> 00:47:23.425
They beat me up and stole my clothes.
Those men wanted to have sex with me.

574
00:47:23.468 --> 00:47:25.219
Can we discuss this
somewhere else, Louis?

575
00:47:25.261 --> 00:47:27.429
One of them tried
to bend me over this...

576
00:47:28.056 --> 00:47:31.225
I mean, if this place is indicative

577
00:47:31.267 --> 00:47:33.310
of the state of correctional institutions
in this country,

578
00:47:33.394 --> 00:47:34.770
they might as well let
all the convicts out.

579
00:47:34.854 --> 00:47:36.605
It's far worse on the inside.

580
00:47:36.689 --> 00:47:39.149
Stealing from your friends
at the club, Louis?

581
00:47:39.234 --> 00:47:42.110
Heroin, Louis?
Have you lost your mind?

582
00:47:42.153 --> 00:47:45.614
Mother wants me to call off the wedding
and so does Todd.

583
00:47:45.698 --> 00:47:48.367
Todd? What does Todd have
to do with it?

584
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:50.536
You've been fired from Duke & Duke.

585
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.664
They're preparing charges against you
for embezzlement.

586
00:47:53.957 --> 00:47:57.125
Embezzlement? I've never stolen
anything in my life.

587
00:47:57.168 --> 00:47:58.961
How could the man I loved,

588
00:47:59.045 --> 00:48:03.549
whose children I wanted to have
and breastfeed, be a heroin dealer?

589
00:48:03.633 --> 00:48:06.343
It wasn't heroin,
it was angel dust, PCP, and...

590
00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:10.138
Listen, Penelope,
I swear to you, on my honor,

591
00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:12.140
with almighty God as my witness,

592
00:48:12.225 --> 00:48:15.185
I am not an angel dust dealer.

593
00:48:19.524 --> 00:48:21.316
Oh, Louis.

594
00:48:26.739 --> 00:48:29.324
I've been looking everywhere for you,
baby. Listen, Louis...

595
00:48:29.367 --> 00:48:31.410
- Would you...
- I'm hurting, baby. I just need a shot.

596
00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:33.203
- Please...
- Louis.

597
00:48:33.288 --> 00:48:34.663
Who is this person?

598
00:48:34.747 --> 00:48:37.291
I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

599
00:48:38.626 --> 00:48:40.627
Don't say it, Louis.

600
00:48:43.006 --> 00:48:48.176
Come on, baby, just a dime bag.
I'll do all those things you like.

601
00:48:50.179 --> 00:48:55.142
You lying, filthy, disgusting creep.

602
00:48:55.184 --> 00:48:59.938
Todd was right about you. I never want
to see you again as long as I live.

603
00:49:12.327 --> 00:49:15.912
Grand! Great! Thanks a lot.

604
00:49:16.456 --> 00:49:20.375
It was a joke.
Your friend said it would get you off.

605
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.337
You mean,
someone told you to do this to me?

606
00:49:23.379 --> 00:49:25.464
Yeah, and he paid me
a hundred bucks, too.

607
00:49:25.548 --> 00:49:27.132
He's right over there.

608
00:49:31.012 --> 00:49:32.721
So let me get this straight,

609
00:49:32.764 --> 00:49:34.431
I'm gonna give you $20 for the cab,

610
00:49:34.515 --> 00:49:36.892
and you're gonna give me $50
when we get to your house?

611
00:49:36.934 --> 00:49:40.145
That is correct.
My butler, Coleman, will give you $50,

612
00:49:40.229 --> 00:49:43.106
and drive you anywhere in the city
you wish to go.

613
00:49:43.316 --> 00:49:46.068
You don't exactly look like
the type that has a butler.

614
00:49:46.152 --> 00:49:47.819
You know, if you're hustling me...

615
00:49:47.904 --> 00:49:51.239
Hustling you? Hustling you?

616
00:49:53.826 --> 00:49:56.912
You don't think they give these
to just anyone, do you?

617
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.000
I can charge goods and services
in over 86 countries around the world.

618
00:50:02.919 --> 00:50:06.421
Yeah? Well, I don't take credit cards.

619
00:50:16.265 --> 00:50:18.892
You'll see what a mistake all this was.

620
00:50:29.028 --> 00:50:30.487
Yes?

621
00:50:30.571 --> 00:50:33.907
Coleman, could you please let me in?
I'm having trouble with my key.

622
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.992
Who are you? What do you want?

623
00:50:36.077 --> 00:50:39.371
Coleman, just unchain the door
and let me in. I'm in no mood for jokes.

624
00:50:39.455 --> 00:50:43.792
Coleman? There's no Coleman here.
You've made a mistake.

625
00:50:51.592 --> 00:50:53.593
Excuse me, for a moment.

626
00:50:54.137 --> 00:50:58.223
Coleman! Let me in!

627
00:51:00.143 --> 00:51:03.437
If you don't go away,
I shall be forced to call the police.

628
00:51:16.993 --> 00:51:21.913
Hello. I'll be making a cash withdrawal
for the amount of $500.

629
00:51:22.999 --> 00:51:25.167
Well, in fact, we'll make it $1,000.

630
00:51:32.592 --> 00:51:34.050
Excuse me.

631
00:51:43.019 --> 00:51:47.272
I'm sorry, Mr. Winthorpe,
but the IRS has frozen your accounts.

632
00:51:47.356 --> 00:51:49.441
What are you talking about?
You know me.

633
00:51:49.525 --> 00:51:51.651
You're a heroin dealer, Mr. Winthorpe.

634
00:51:51.694 --> 00:51:55.781
It wasn't heroin, it was angel dust, PCP,
and I never even had my hands on it.

635
00:51:55.865 --> 00:52:00.118
Regardless, it's not the kind of business
we want here at First National.

636
00:52:02.205 --> 00:52:04.372
May I see your credit cards please?

637
00:52:09.253 --> 00:52:11.797
- I've been ordered to repossess them.
- What?

638
00:52:11.881 --> 00:52:14.758
Now, wait a minute,
what am I supposed to live on?

639
00:52:14.842 --> 00:52:17.093
I mean, what's going to happen to me?

640
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:19.221
Roger.

641
00:52:31.984 --> 00:52:35.070
Why is someone deliberately trying
to ruin my life?

642
00:52:35.822 --> 00:52:38.240
Tell you what.
Forget about the $50, okay?

643
00:52:38.324 --> 00:52:40.909
I'm just real tired. I'm going home.

644
00:52:42.578 --> 00:52:46.081
You've got to believe me.
You must believe me.

645
00:52:46.123 --> 00:52:49.835
I have been framed.
You can't just leave me here.

646
00:52:49.919 --> 00:52:52.504
I've got enough problems, Louis.

647
00:52:56.092 --> 00:52:57.968
Come on, come on.

648
00:52:59.262 --> 00:53:02.597
Listen! Wait! Wait.

649
00:53:03.766 --> 00:53:08.603
I have over $150,000 in that bank.

650
00:53:09.438 --> 00:53:13.149
But you don't care
because you helped them do this to me.

651
00:53:21.033 --> 00:53:23.118
Get off your knees, Louis.

652
00:53:31.043 --> 00:53:32.794
Give me your hand.

653
00:53:36.173 --> 00:53:38.049
Soft hands.

654
00:53:38.968 --> 00:53:40.594
And a manicure.

655
00:53:41.387 --> 00:53:44.306
You haven't done a hard day's work
in your life, have you?

656
00:53:48.477 --> 00:53:50.395
I'm gonna regret this, but...

657
00:53:51.272 --> 00:53:54.691
Come on. Get in.

658
00:54:12.126 --> 00:54:16.296
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
This is about a grave, grave mistake.

659
00:54:17.256 --> 00:54:19.716
Hey, that look just like
the dude that had me busted.

660
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.426
Sir?

661
00:54:22.345 --> 00:54:25.055
Right there,
he looked just like the mother...

662
00:54:25.139 --> 00:54:28.600
I mean, he looks just like
the gentleman that had me busted.

663
00:54:29.268 --> 00:54:31.144
To whom are you referring, sir?

664
00:54:31.187 --> 00:54:33.521
Right there. The dude right over there.

665
00:54:35.024 --> 00:54:37.692
- Right over there.
- That's my car.

666
00:54:37.735 --> 00:54:42.405
Coleman! Coleman, that's my car!

667
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:46.076
That's my car! That's my driver.

668
00:54:51.207 --> 00:54:54.000
There's some strange shit
going on here, Coleman.

669
00:54:54.251 --> 00:54:57.504
You don't want to be late
for your first day at work, sir.

670
00:55:04.512 --> 00:55:05.887
I mean, what am I supposed
to do in here?

671
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.430
What they want from me?

672
00:55:07.515 --> 00:55:10.892
- I'm sure they'll tell you, sir.
- Yeah, what if I can't do it?

673
00:55:11.769 --> 00:55:13.770
Just be yourself, sir.

674
00:55:14.063 --> 00:55:17.357
Whatever happens,
they can't take that away from you.

675
00:55:33.499 --> 00:55:34.749
Excuse me, my name is...

676
00:55:34.834 --> 00:55:38.586
Yes, Mr. Valentine, they're waiting
for you in the last office down the hall.

677
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:06.114
William, my boy. Right on time.
Come in, come in.

678
00:56:08.993 --> 00:56:10.952
Sit down.

679
00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:16.958
No, thanks, guys.
I already had breakfast this morning.

680
00:56:17.293 --> 00:56:19.961
This is not a meal, Valentine.

681
00:56:20.046 --> 00:56:24.174
We are here to try to explain to you
what it is we do here.

682
00:56:24.383 --> 00:56:26.926
We are commodities brokers, William.

683
00:56:27.636 --> 00:56:29.763
Now, what are commodities?

684
00:56:30.097 --> 00:56:32.974
Commodities are agricultural products.

685
00:56:33.017 --> 00:56:36.478
Like coffee, that you had for breakfast.

686
00:56:36.812 --> 00:56:39.189
Wheat, which is used to make bread.

687
00:56:39.648 --> 00:56:42.484
Pork bellies,
which is used to make bacon,

688
00:56:42.526 --> 00:56:46.488
which you might find in a bacon
and lettuce and tomato sandwich.

689
00:56:47.823 --> 00:56:52.994
Then there are other commodities
like frozen orange juice and gold.

690
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:58.666
Though, of course,
gold doesn't grow on trees like oranges.

691
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.337
- Clear so far?
- Yeah.

692
00:57:02.505 --> 00:57:06.508
Good, William. Now,
some of our clients are speculating

693
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:10.428
that the price of gold
will rise in the future.

694
00:57:10.513 --> 00:57:12.347
And we have other clients
who are speculating

695
00:57:12.389 --> 00:57:15.266
that the price of gold is going to fall.

696
00:57:15.684 --> 00:57:22.190
They place their orders with us
and we buy or sell their gold for them.

697
00:57:22.358 --> 00:57:24.609
Tell him the good part.

698
00:57:25.444 --> 00:57:27.821
The good part, William, is that,

699
00:57:27.863 --> 00:57:32.867
no matter whether our clients
make money or lose money,

700
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:36.121
Duke & Duke get the commissions.

701
00:57:36.205 --> 00:57:38.998
Well, what do you think, Valentine?

702
00:57:41.168 --> 00:57:44.212
Well, it sounds to me
like you guys are a couple of bookies.

703
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.923
I told you he'd understand.

704
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.845
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out what happened.

705
00:57:52.179 --> 00:57:54.430
It's the same guy
who tried to rob the payroll.

706
00:57:54.515 --> 00:57:56.641
No doubt about it, that's him.

707
00:57:56.725 --> 00:57:58.726
He planted the drugs on me.

708
00:57:58.769 --> 00:58:01.312
Rahim, Mohammed, Larry.
How you guys doing?

709
00:58:01.397 --> 00:58:04.232
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey, how you doing, baby?

710
00:58:06.026 --> 00:58:08.027
You know those people?

711
00:58:20.249 --> 00:58:22.417
He was wearing my Harvard tie.

712
00:58:22.459 --> 00:58:27.422
Can you believe it? My Harvard tie.
Like, oh, sure, he went to Harvard.

713
00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:31.885
I mean, if he's being driven around
in my car,

714
00:58:31.927 --> 00:58:34.345
he could actually be living in my house.

715
00:58:35.014 --> 00:58:37.140
Maybe he's even taken my job.

716
00:58:37.224 --> 00:58:38.766
You know, for all I know,

717
00:58:38.851 --> 00:58:41.811
right at this moment
he could be fondling my fiancée.

718
00:58:42.354 --> 00:58:46.357
And Coleman.
After years of service, this betrayal.

719
00:58:46.442 --> 00:58:48.443
I don't understand it.

720
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:52.071
There's going to be retribution.
Oh, he's going to pay.

721
00:58:52.114 --> 00:58:54.782
- The things that I am going to...
- Shut up, Louis.

722
00:58:54.867 --> 00:58:56.451
Listen, taxis cost money,

723
00:58:56.535 --> 00:58:59.037
food costs money
and rent costs money!

724
00:58:59.121 --> 00:59:02.373
Now, you want me to help you out,
I expect a lot in return.

725
00:59:04.501 --> 00:59:07.670
These were here when I moved in.
Put them on if you want.

726
00:59:13.219 --> 00:59:17.472
Look, I cannot begin to tell you
how much I appreciate this...

727
00:59:18.724 --> 00:59:19.974
Ophelia.

728
00:59:20.017 --> 00:59:22.477
Ophelia. You realize that
that's the name...

729
00:59:22.561 --> 00:59:24.187
I know, I know, I know.
Hamlet's girlfriend.

730
00:59:24.271 --> 00:59:28.441
He went crazy, she killed herself.
This is not Shakespeare, Louis.

731
00:59:29.818 --> 00:59:31.277
Look, I'm 24 years old.

732
00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.031
I'm from a small, miserable little mining
town you probably never heard of.

733
00:59:35.741 --> 00:59:38.076
The only thing I've got going for me
in this whole big, wide world

734
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.996
is this body, this face,
and what I got up here.

735
00:59:52.091 --> 00:59:55.677
I don't do drugs
and I don't have a pimp.

736
00:59:57.888 --> 00:59:59.389
This place is a dump,

737
00:59:59.473 --> 01:00:03.559
but it's cheap,
it's clean and it's all mine.

738
01:00:03.644 --> 01:00:06.854
I've saved 42 grand
and it's in T-Bills earning interest.

739
01:00:07.648 --> 01:00:09.440
I figure,
I got three more years on my back.

740
01:00:09.525 --> 01:00:11.317
I'll have enough to retire on.

741
01:00:12.027 --> 01:00:14.195
You're a prostitute?

742
01:00:20.202 --> 01:00:22.996
I'm talking about
a business proposition, Louis.

743
01:00:23.038 --> 01:00:28.001
I help you get yourself back on your feet
and you pay me, in cash, five figures.

744
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.462
That's the deal
and it's not subject to negotiation.

745
01:00:32.131 --> 01:00:34.048
Understood?

746
01:00:49.898 --> 01:00:51.065
By the way,

747
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:54.652
food and rent are not the only things
around here that cost money.

748
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:56.946
You sleep on the couch.

749
01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:01.951
It's hit rock bottom. Come on, let's buy.

750
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:06.998
Mortimer Duke here.
Buy 200 May belly contracts at 66.8.

751
01:01:07.082 --> 01:01:08.833
Put them on my personal account.

752
01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.293
That's a big mistake, man.

753
01:01:10.377 --> 01:01:14.547
Valentine, something very important
is going on here. Just watch.

754
01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:17.175
All right, but you all gonna get
reamed on this one.

755
01:01:17.259 --> 01:01:19.802
Why shouldn't we buy now, William?

756
01:01:19.887 --> 01:01:22.013
Price is going to keep going down.

757
01:01:22.765 --> 01:01:26.142
Randolph, this isn't Monopoly money
we're playing with.

758
01:01:29.104 --> 01:01:32.106
This is Randolph Duke.
Hold that belly order a moment.

759
01:01:33.734 --> 01:01:38.112
Tell me just why you think the price
of pork bellies is going down, William.

760
01:01:38.364 --> 01:01:40.323
It's Christmastime. Everybody's uptight.

761
01:01:40.407 --> 01:01:42.992
Could we please buy now, Randolph?

762
01:01:43.077 --> 01:01:44.786
All right, if you want to lose money,
go ahead.

763
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:47.080
What are you trying to say, William?

764
01:01:47.164 --> 01:01:50.500
Okay. Pork belly prices
have been dropping all morning.

765
01:01:50.959 --> 01:01:52.293
Which means everybody's sitting
in their office

766
01:01:52.336 --> 01:01:53.628
and they're waiting for them
to hit rock bottom

767
01:01:53.712 --> 01:01:55.296
so they can buy cheap and go long.

768
01:01:55.381 --> 01:01:57.965
So people that own the pork belly
contracts are going bat shit.

769
01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:00.593
'Cause they're thinking,
"Hey, we're losing all our damn money

770
01:02:00.636 --> 01:02:01.677
"and Christmas is around the corner.

771
01:02:01.762 --> 01:02:03.054
"And I ain't gonna have no money
to buy my son

772
01:02:03.138 --> 01:02:05.390
"the G.I. Joe with the kung fu grip,"
okay?

773
01:02:05.474 --> 01:02:06.474
"And my wife ain't gonna wanna...

774
01:02:06.517 --> 01:02:08.976
"My wife ain't gonna make love to me
'cause I ain't got no money," right?

775
01:02:09.061 --> 01:02:10.478
So they sitting there
and they panicking.

776
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:12.313
They screaming, "Sell! Sell!"

777
01:02:12.398 --> 01:02:13.981
'Cause they don't want to lose
all their money, right?

778
01:02:14.024 --> 01:02:15.983
They out there, panicking right now.
I can feel it.

779
01:02:16.068 --> 01:02:18.486
They out there. They panicking.
Look at them.

780
01:02:18.529 --> 01:02:21.406
He's right, Mortimer, my God, look at it.

781
01:02:22.282 --> 01:02:24.742
I'd wait till you get to about 64,
then I'd buy.

782
01:02:24.827 --> 01:02:27.537
You'll have cleared out
all the suckers by then.

783
01:02:28.288 --> 01:02:31.457
Do you realize how much money
he just saved us?

784
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.168
Money isn't everything, Randolph.

785
01:02:36.839 --> 01:02:41.008
Advise our clients interested
in bellies to buy at 64.

786
01:02:41.093 --> 01:02:43.970
Mr. Valentine has set the price.

787
01:02:45.764 --> 01:02:49.934
Well done, William. Very well done.

788
01:02:50.018 --> 01:02:52.854
Come on, Randolph,
we're gonna be late.

789
01:03:22.843 --> 01:03:23.843
Yo.

790
01:03:25.179 --> 01:03:27.638
Mortimer dropped his money clip.

791
01:03:28.432 --> 01:03:29.932
You can count it. It's all there, all of it.

792
01:03:30.017 --> 01:03:31.142
Thank you, William.

793
01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:32.643
It's all there, man, count it.

794
01:03:32.728 --> 01:03:36.063
I'm sure it is, William.
Thank you and keep up the good work.

795
01:03:36.315 --> 01:03:38.399
All right, Randy. All right.

796
01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:41.360
Nice try, Mortimer.

797
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:34.622
What do you think, huh?

798
01:04:34.706 --> 01:04:36.207
That was great, that was really great.

799
01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:39.293
- That's perfect.
- Witherspoon.

800
01:04:40.671 --> 01:04:43.548
...and she stepped on the ball.

801
01:04:46.677 --> 01:04:49.971
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.

802
01:04:52.891 --> 01:04:56.894
- There you are.
- I think I'm going to be sick.

803
01:04:56.979 --> 01:04:59.480
Don't worry, I'll handle this, pookums.

804
01:05:00.774 --> 01:05:03.276
Todd, Harry, Andrew, Philip.

805
01:05:03.318 --> 01:05:07.196
I realize this looks completely awful
but I just wanted to assure you,

806
01:05:07.573 --> 01:05:09.991
my friends,
that I am completely innocent.

807
01:05:10.075 --> 01:05:12.326
I'm going to fight this thing till the end.

808
01:05:12.369 --> 01:05:15.079
Someone is out to get me
and I know who it is.

809
01:05:15.163 --> 01:05:18.291
The important thing is
that I can rely on you,

810
01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:21.127
my friends, as character witnesses.

811
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:30.094
I'm going to be defending myself

812
01:05:30.178 --> 01:05:33.848
and, well, I wondered
if you could see your way clear

813
01:05:33.932 --> 01:05:38.352
to perhaps advance me
a small loan until the hearing.

814
01:05:40.856 --> 01:05:44.984
Frankly, Winthorpe,
and I think I speak for all of us,

815
01:05:45.027 --> 01:05:46.861
I think it shows incredibly bad taste

816
01:05:46.945 --> 01:05:49.864
for you to come here
and embarrass us all like this.

817
01:05:51.533 --> 01:05:54.035
I believe I'm still a member of this club.

818
01:05:55.537 --> 01:05:59.040
Nobody wants to buy
your drugs here, Louis.

819
01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:01.500
Now why don't you just go away?

820
01:06:14.765 --> 01:06:16.766
Burned my fingers, man.

821
01:06:20.228 --> 01:06:21.812
I beg your pardon?

822
01:06:23.565 --> 01:06:26.442
Man, that watch is so hot, it's smoking.

823
01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:30.863
Hot? Do you mean to imply stolen?

824
01:06:30.989 --> 01:06:34.200
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
-50 bucks?

825
01:06:34.409 --> 01:06:36.661
No, no, no. This is a Rochefoucauld,

826
01:06:36.745 --> 01:06:38.996
the thinnest water-resistant watch
in the world.

827
01:06:39.081 --> 01:06:41.666
Singularly unique, sculptured in design,

828
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:42.958
hand-crafted in Switzerland

829
01:06:43.043 --> 01:06:46.212
and water-resistant
to three atmospheres.

830
01:06:46.254 --> 01:06:51.926
This is the sports watch of the '80s.
$6,955 retail.

831
01:06:52.719 --> 01:06:54.428
You got a receipt?

832
01:06:54.513 --> 01:06:56.430
Look, it tells time simultaneously

833
01:06:56.515 --> 01:06:59.934
in Monte Carlo, Beverly Hills, London,
Paris, Rome and Gstaad.

834
01:07:00.268 --> 01:07:04.647
In Philadelphia, it's worth 50 bucks.

835
01:07:06.108 --> 01:07:08.109
Just give me the money.

836
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:22.790
How much for the gun?

837
01:07:27.629 --> 01:07:31.465
So this snail is standing
in front of the Cadillac salesman, see,

838
01:07:31.508 --> 01:07:33.634
and he looks up at the salesman

839
01:07:33.719 --> 01:07:36.137
and he says,
"How much is that Cadillac?"

840
01:07:42.436 --> 01:07:46.480
The snail says, "I want
a big S put on each door, a big S,

841
01:07:46.523 --> 01:07:49.900
"and on top of the car,
I want another big S

842
01:07:49.985 --> 01:07:51.652
"so everybody can see it. "

843
01:07:51.737 --> 01:07:53.988
So the salesman says,
"But what do you want that for?"

844
01:07:54.072 --> 01:07:56.157
He says, "Well, you see,
when I drive down the avenue,

845
01:07:56.199 --> 01:08:01.203
"I want everybody to say
'Look at that S car go. "'

846
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:10.838
"Look at that S car go. "

847
01:08:17.596 --> 01:08:20.723
I'm considering going long
on April wheat.

848
01:08:20.807 --> 01:08:22.683
What do you think, Valentine?

849
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.729
I can think of three real good reasons

850
01:08:26.813 --> 01:08:29.023
why you shouldn't do
something like that, Judge.

851
01:08:29.107 --> 01:08:32.401
One, the Russian wheat harvest isn't
going to be as bad as everybody thinks.

852
01:08:32.486 --> 01:08:34.612
And two...

853
01:08:36.782 --> 01:08:39.784
And three, judging from all these jewels
around your girlfriend's neck here,

854
01:08:39.868 --> 01:08:43.913
I think you'll need every penny
you've got just to keep her happy.

855
01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:27.248
103. That's it, you're staying in bed.

856
01:09:27.874 --> 01:09:31.293
The man has moved into my house.
He's stolen my job.

857
01:09:31.378 --> 01:09:33.254
I have to do something.

858
01:09:35.131 --> 01:09:37.132
Stay here.

859
01:09:43.431 --> 01:09:45.891
It's 10:00. Here's Johnny.

860
01:09:45.976 --> 01:09:47.893
Listen, baby, I'm sorry.

861
01:09:47.936 --> 01:09:50.271
My mama just came in from out of town.

862
01:09:50.313 --> 01:09:52.273
Can we do it next week?

863
01:09:55.986 --> 01:09:57.987
Flowers for me?

864
01:09:58.113 --> 01:09:59.780
Thanks.

865
01:10:05.495 --> 01:10:06.579
What are you doing?

866
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:08.747
You've got company.
Business is business.

867
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:10.958
I'll go for a walk or something.
The fresh air will do me good.

868
01:10:11.001 --> 01:10:12.585
Lay down.

869
01:10:17.757 --> 01:10:20.759
I'm sorry you had to cancel
your appointment.

870
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:25.055
What are you doing?

871
01:10:39.779 --> 01:10:42.990
Ophelia, I can't tell you
how good that feels.

872
01:10:43.533 --> 01:10:45.951
You've been so kind to me.

873
01:10:46.453 --> 01:10:49.955
I'm just protecting my investment.
That's all.

874
01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.043
Shut up and go to sleep.

875
01:11:09.267 --> 01:11:12.770
99 and a half. You're not getting
out of bed, though, until it's normal.

876
01:11:12.854 --> 01:11:15.564
I feel fine
and I've inconvenienced you enough.

877
01:11:15.732 --> 01:11:18.150
You have work to do and so do I.

878
01:11:18.652 --> 01:11:20.569
Nobody works on Christmas Eve.

879
01:11:20.654 --> 01:11:21.904
I'm gonna go shopping

880
01:11:21.988 --> 01:11:24.823
and then I'm gonna come back
and make you a nice quiet dinner.

881
01:11:24.866 --> 01:11:26.492
Now, read your paper.

882
01:11:43.009 --> 01:11:44.802
Christmas, huh?

883
01:11:45.136 --> 01:11:48.055
I'll give him a Christmas present
he'll never forget.

884
01:13:14.309 --> 01:13:17.644
William, where've you been?
The party's already begun.

885
01:13:17.729 --> 01:13:19.646
I have some work to finish
in my office, Mr. Duke.

886
01:13:19.731 --> 01:13:23.192
It's Christmas Eve and William wants
to keep working, Mortimer.

887
01:13:23.985 --> 01:13:27.404
I'll think of you in Stockholm,
when I accept the Nobel Prize.

888
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:29.490
The wager has two parts as I recall.

889
01:13:29.574 --> 01:13:32.701
Something about
a second party turning to crime.

890
01:13:35.663 --> 01:13:38.332
Didn't you say you had
some work to do, Valentine?

891
01:13:38.416 --> 01:13:42.753
Yes sir. I was wondering about this
$10,000 check to Mr. Clarence Beeks.

892
01:13:42.837 --> 01:13:44.922
I'll take care of it, Valentine.

893
01:13:45.006 --> 01:13:46.507
I don't seem to recall
any Clarence Beeks

894
01:13:46.591 --> 01:13:48.008
working for the firm, Mr. Duke.

895
01:13:48.093 --> 01:13:51.053
It was before you joined us, Valentine.

896
01:13:51.221 --> 01:13:55.891
We did manage to stay in business
for 47 years before your arrival.

897
01:13:56.101 --> 01:13:58.977
Have a drink, William. Merry Christmas.

898
01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:01.230
Merry Christmas, Mr. Duke.

899
01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:02.940
- What?
- Merry Christmas.

900
01:14:03.024 --> 01:14:06.360
Oh, oh, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

901
01:14:30.385 --> 01:14:32.553
Just what do you think you're doing?

902
01:14:33.054 --> 01:14:35.097
Randolph! Mortimer!

903
01:14:35.181 --> 01:14:37.808
Come in here quickly!
I've finally caught him!

904
01:14:40.854 --> 01:14:43.230
- Who are you?
- I've caught him red-handed.

905
01:14:43.314 --> 01:14:45.315
Winthorpe, is that you?

906
01:14:45.483 --> 01:14:48.735
I'm making a citizen's arrest.
This man is a drug dealer.

907
01:14:48.778 --> 01:14:52.865
Look. Look, here in his office drawer,
he's got all the bad drugs here.

908
01:14:52.907 --> 01:14:55.784
Marijuana joints, pills, Quaalude,

909
01:14:55.869 --> 01:15:00.372
Valium, yellow ones, red ones,
cocaine grinder, drug needles.

910
01:15:00.415 --> 01:15:02.749
He's the pusher, not me.

911
01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:06.211
Really, I just came in and caught
this man planting this stuff in my desk.

912
01:15:06.254 --> 01:15:09.131
It's obviously some primitive attempt
to try to frame me.

913
01:15:09.215 --> 01:15:13.802
Frame you? Boy, if that isn't
the pot calling the kettle black.

914
01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.181
This man's obviously a lunatic.
I'm calling security.

915
01:15:18.349 --> 01:15:20.350
Put that phone down.

916
01:15:21.519 --> 01:15:24.646
Hello, security, Merry Christmas.

917
01:15:27.609 --> 01:15:29.776
You try to rob me, plant drugs on me.

918
01:15:29.861 --> 01:15:33.780
You steal my house, my car, my job.
You know, I ought to kill him right now.

919
01:15:33.823 --> 01:15:35.782
Hey, look, man,
this is a big misunderstanding, all right.

920
01:15:35.867 --> 01:15:38.285
I don't know nothing about your house
and your car and your job, really.

921
01:15:38.369 --> 01:15:40.078
Could you put the gun away?
Will you ask the Dukes?

922
01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:43.874
Put that gun away at once, Winthorpe.
Have you lost your mind?

923
01:15:45.293 --> 01:15:46.919
Freeze, slime ball.

924
01:15:48.963 --> 01:15:51.548
I realize this whole experience

925
01:15:51.633 --> 01:15:54.092
must have been
rather unsettling for you.

926
01:15:54.135 --> 01:15:56.470
Winthorpe, don't leave. We can explain.

927
01:15:56.971 --> 01:16:00.057
Yeah, you'll be sorry.

928
01:16:01.976 --> 01:16:05.854
You'll all be very, very sorry.

929
01:16:27.961 --> 01:16:31.880
Poor, deluded creature.
We caught him pilfering at our club,

930
01:16:31.965 --> 01:16:35.175
embezzling funds, selling drugs.

931
01:16:35.635 --> 01:16:37.928
Now he's dressing up like Santa Claus.

932
01:16:39.138 --> 01:16:41.056
Very sordid business.

933
01:16:41.516 --> 01:16:44.851
I can't believe Winthorpe
would fall to pieces like that.

934
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:47.521
It's none of my business,
but that guy belongs behind bars.

935
01:16:47.605 --> 01:16:51.233
- He's unemployed, Valentine.
- It's no excuse, Mortimer.

936
01:16:51.317 --> 01:16:53.986
He's flat broke, obviously hungry.

937
01:16:54.028 --> 01:16:56.196
Oh, but he has money
to buy drugs, right?

938
01:16:56.239 --> 01:16:58.115
Listen, you can't be soft
on people like that.

939
01:16:58.199 --> 01:17:00.325
Take it from me. I know, Randolph.

940
01:18:06.267 --> 01:18:08.435
Pay up, Mortimer, I've won the bet.

941
01:18:10.938 --> 01:18:13.273
Here, $1.

942
01:18:15.777 --> 01:18:21.198
We took a perfectly useless psychopath
like Valentine,

943
01:18:21.657 --> 01:18:24.910
and turned him
into a successful executive.

944
01:18:25.995 --> 01:18:27.996
And during the same time,

945
01:18:28.623 --> 01:18:31.666
we turned an honest, hard-working man

946
01:18:32.502 --> 01:18:36.922
into a violently deranged
would-be killer.

947
01:18:38.966 --> 01:18:42.511
Now, what are we going to do
about taking Winthorpe back

948
01:18:42.595 --> 01:18:44.846
and returning Valentine to the ghetto?

949
01:18:44.931 --> 01:18:48.058
I don't want Winthorpe back
after what he's done.

950
01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:52.854
You mean keep Valentine on
as managing director?

951
01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.524
Do you really believe

952
01:18:55.608 --> 01:18:59.319
I would have a nigger
run our family business, Randolph?

953
01:18:59.445 --> 01:19:02.489
Of course not. Neither would I.

954
01:19:03.366 --> 01:19:06.451
I do think we should hold off
on switching them back, though.

955
01:19:06.494 --> 01:19:09.496
Until we get that crop report,
New Year's Eve, don't you?

956
01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:12.374
Absolutely. No sense
rocking the boat until then.

957
01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:15.919
If Mr. Beeks does
what we paid him to do,

958
01:19:16.587 --> 01:19:19.589
we should have a very happy New Year.

959
01:19:19.674 --> 01:19:21.675
Indeed.

960
01:19:40.361 --> 01:19:43.155
Hey, Winthorpe! Winthorpe!

961
01:19:51.038 --> 01:19:52.038
Hey.

962
01:20:14.228 --> 01:20:17.230
Hey, Winthorpe. Hey, yo, Winthorpe!

963
01:20:18.566 --> 01:20:20.775
Winthorpe. Yo.

964
01:20:24.405 --> 01:20:26.072
Sorry about that.

965
01:20:40.046 --> 01:20:42.464
No, no.

966
01:20:44.717 --> 01:20:46.301
Hey, taxi!

967
01:22:43.127 --> 01:22:45.712
Hi, Louis. Merry Christmas.

968
01:22:47.506 --> 01:22:52.135
Louis. Louis, when you get out,
I have a big surprise for you.

969
01:22:54.013 --> 01:22:56.514
Excuse me. The door was open...

970
01:22:56.557 --> 01:22:59.142
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for a Louis Winthorpe.

971
01:22:59.226 --> 01:23:00.852
Does he live here?

972
01:23:01.103 --> 01:23:03.480
Wait here a minute, I'll be right back.

973
01:23:07.234 --> 01:23:10.403
Louis. Louis, it's him. It's Valentine.

974
01:23:11.364 --> 01:23:14.866
Louis. Louis.

975
01:23:20.247 --> 01:23:21.831
Louis.

976
01:23:23.042 --> 01:23:25.585
It was close,
but he's going to be all right.

977
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.796
Now, make sure he gets plenty of rest.

978
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.757
And for God's sake, no excitement.

979
01:23:32.468 --> 01:23:33.885
- Thanks, Doc.
- Not at all.

980
01:23:33.928 --> 01:23:35.970
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

981
01:23:36.055 --> 01:23:37.931
- I'll let myself out, Coleman. Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

982
01:23:37.973 --> 01:23:40.100
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

983
01:23:48.317 --> 01:23:51.820
It was a dream.
I dreamt the whole thing.

984
01:23:51.904 --> 01:23:53.905
It was just a bad dream.

985
01:23:54.615 --> 01:23:57.992
Good morning, sir. Merry Christmas.

986
01:23:58.244 --> 01:24:01.871
Coleman, I had
the most absurd nightmare.

987
01:24:02.498 --> 01:24:04.874
I was poor and no one liked me.

988
01:24:04.959 --> 01:24:08.753
I lost my job, I lost my house.
Penelope hated me.

989
01:24:09.255 --> 01:24:12.215
And it was all because
of this terrible, awful Negro.

990
01:24:15.803 --> 01:24:16.803
Oh, dear!

991
01:24:16.887 --> 01:24:19.931
It was the Dukes. It was the Dukes.

992
01:24:20.015 --> 01:24:22.517
You're a dead man, Valentine!

993
01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:23.601
Look, Louis.

994
01:24:23.811 --> 01:24:28.231
It was an experiment.
They used us as guinea pigs, man.

995
01:24:30.651 --> 01:24:32.819
Dukes used us as guinea pigs.

996
01:24:33.362 --> 01:24:36.740
To see how our lives would turn out.
They made a bet.

997
01:24:36.824 --> 01:24:39.659
- I'm afraid it's true, sir.
- I believe him, Louis.

998
01:24:39.744 --> 01:24:44.622
The Dukes ruined my life over a bet?

999
01:24:44.999 --> 01:24:47.041
For how much?

1000
01:24:48.753 --> 01:24:50.462
A dollar.

1001
01:24:51.005 --> 01:24:52.547
$1.

1002
01:24:53.799 --> 01:24:56.801
Fine, that's the way they want it.

1003
01:24:58.345 --> 01:24:59.721
No problem.

1004
01:25:02.183 --> 01:25:03.433
You know, you can't just go around

1005
01:25:03.517 --> 01:25:06.019
and shoot people in the kneecaps
with a double-barreled shotgun

1006
01:25:06.103 --> 01:25:08.021
'cause you're pissed at them.

1007
01:25:08.481 --> 01:25:09.898
Why not?

1008
01:25:09.982 --> 01:25:13.026
It's called assault with a deadly weapon.
You get 20 years for that shit.

1009
01:25:13.068 --> 01:25:15.612
Listen, do you have any better ideas?

1010
01:25:16.197 --> 01:25:18.072
Yeah, you know, it occurs to me

1011
01:25:18.157 --> 01:25:22.202
that the best way you hurt rich people
is by turning them into poor people.

1012
01:25:22.745 --> 01:25:26.372
You have to admit, sir,
you didn't like it yourself a bit.

1013
01:25:26.457 --> 01:25:28.041
<i>And now for the news.</i>

1014
01:25:28.125 --> 01:25:29.667
<i>Under heavy security,</i>

1015
01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:32.545
<i>the crop estimates
for next year's orange crop</i>

1016
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:34.380
<i>are being delivered from Miami</i>

1017
01:25:34.423 --> 01:25:37.550
<i>to the Department of Agriculture
in Washington, DC.</i>

1018
01:25:37.635 --> 01:25:39.803
Louis. Louis, that's him.

1019
01:25:39.887 --> 01:25:41.805
That's the guy
who paid me to talk dirty to you.

1020
01:25:41.889 --> 01:25:43.056
<i>In charge of security</i>

1021
01:25:43.098 --> 01:25:45.600
<i>is Mr. Clarence Beeks,
head of Lyndhurst Security.</i>

1022
01:25:45.684 --> 01:25:47.268
- Clarence Beeks!
- Clarence Beeks!

1023
01:25:47.353 --> 01:25:49.187
The Dukes just gave that guy 10 grand.

1024
01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:52.732
Ten grand? I saw an outlay
in the payroll to him for $50,000.

1025
01:25:52.775 --> 01:25:54.901
Mortimer said it was for research.

1026
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:57.737
Yeah, research on how he can get
his hands on that top secret crop report

1027
01:25:57.822 --> 01:25:59.781
two days before it goes public.

1028
01:26:00.074 --> 01:26:01.574
My God.

1029
01:26:01.659 --> 01:26:05.370
The Dukes are going to corner
the entire frozen orange juice market.

1030
01:26:06.205 --> 01:26:07.747
Unless somebody stops them.

1031
01:26:07.832 --> 01:26:09.582
Or beats them to it.

1032
01:26:10.918 --> 01:26:12.085
Eggnog?

1033
01:26:12.586 --> 01:26:14.879
<i>Duke & Duke, may I ask who's calling?</i>

1034
01:26:15.047 --> 01:26:18.341
<i>Duke & Duke, I'm afraid he's busy.
Can you hold please?</i>

1035
01:26:18.425 --> 01:26:19.509
<i>May I help you?</i>

1036
01:26:19.593 --> 01:26:22.554
<i>Just a moment, Mr. Beeks,
I'll put you right through.</i>

1037
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:35.275
Operation Strange Fruit proceeding
according to plan.

1038
01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:40.780
I anticipate penetration and acquisition
at 2100 tomorrow. Hold on.

1039
01:26:41.282 --> 01:26:42.866
Fuck off!

1040
01:26:43.284 --> 01:26:48.079
- When can we expect delivery?
- I will be leaving DC by train.

1041
01:26:48.205 --> 01:26:50.790
We'll rendezvous at 2400 hours

1042
01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:55.628
at the Hilton hotel,
parking level D, section 4.

1043
01:26:55.713 --> 01:26:59.257
- That's the orange section.
- Orange, I like that. Very good.

1044
01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.343
The final payment is due on delivery
in cash.

1045
01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.692
Jesus, hey!

1046
01:27:18.027 --> 01:27:20.028
Happy New Year!

1047
01:27:53.562 --> 01:27:55.355
Ever make it with an ape?

1048
01:27:55.439 --> 01:27:58.191
Harvey, haven't you had
enough to drink?

1049
01:27:58.275 --> 01:28:01.319
Are you kidding,
it's not even New Year's Eve.

1050
01:28:01.362 --> 01:28:03.821
Come here, kiss this beautiful ape.

1051
01:28:03.864 --> 01:28:06.866
Come on, give me a little.
Come on, just a little.

1052
01:28:07.743 --> 01:28:09.744
<i>Harrisburg express.</i>

1053
01:28:10.537 --> 01:28:14.082
<i>Stairway C.</i>

1054
01:28:17.252 --> 01:28:20.546
- What?
- It's my turn to drive.

1055
01:28:22.299 --> 01:28:24.509
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

1056
01:28:24.551 --> 01:28:27.220
Well, I'm sure you think it is,
but it isn't.

1057
01:28:27.262 --> 01:28:28.721
No, don't you remember?

1058
01:28:28.764 --> 01:28:31.557
This morning, you drove
the shipment of anchovy paste.

1059
01:28:31.642 --> 01:28:33.059
Yeah, I drove the anchovy paste,

1060
01:28:33.143 --> 01:28:36.062
but you had the videotape recorders
this afternoon.

1061
01:28:37.064 --> 01:28:39.857
Well, I just...
I backed them up about five feet.

1062
01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.859
We have to take turns.
Sometimes it's longer,

1063
01:28:41.902 --> 01:28:44.362
sometimes it's shorter. It's my turn now.

1064
01:28:44.405 --> 01:28:46.030
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

1065
01:28:46.073 --> 01:28:47.073
No.

1066
01:28:54.164 --> 01:28:57.500
- Merry New Year.
- Happy New Year.

1067
01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:00.670
In this country,
we say, "Happy New Year. "

1068
01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:05.591
Thank you for correcting my English,
which stinks.

1069
01:29:05.676 --> 01:29:10.013
I am Nanga Eboko,
exchange student from Cameroon.

1070
01:29:39.752 --> 01:29:41.669
Beef jerky time.

1071
01:29:42.421 --> 01:29:45.548
- You want some beef jerky?
- No, please.

1072
01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.009
There's plenty, you know.

1073
01:29:48.427 --> 01:29:51.262
This animal's being routed
through to New York.

1074
01:29:51.305 --> 01:29:54.390
Its care and feeding instructions
are on this bill of lading.

1075
01:29:54.475 --> 01:29:55.808
Okay, gotcha.

1076
01:29:55.851 --> 01:29:58.144
Now, I doubt if you'll have any problems,
but if you do,

1077
01:29:58.228 --> 01:30:01.022
there's a tranquillizer gun
in the first-aid kit.

1078
01:30:01.857 --> 01:30:03.399
Oh, yeah?

1079
01:30:04.068 --> 01:30:06.277
Say, have you guys been drinking?

1080
01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.528
No, sir. Not us.

1081
01:30:07.613 --> 01:30:10.156
There's enough drunks
on this train already.

1082
01:30:14.661 --> 01:30:16.662
Happy New Year.

1083
01:30:16.789 --> 01:30:21.334
Oh, that's kind of you, son.
And a happy New Year to you, too.

1084
01:30:21.418 --> 01:30:24.295
Could I offer
either of you two gentlemen

1085
01:30:24.338 --> 01:30:28.132
a wee jolt of Irish whiskey
to usher in the New Year?

1086
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:30.301
Not for me, pal.

1087
01:30:32.221 --> 01:30:35.223
I do not drink. It is against my religion.

1088
01:30:35.307 --> 01:30:40.311
I always say, religion's a fine thing,
taken in moderation.

1089
01:30:40.354 --> 01:30:42.563
- Beef jerky?
- Oh, no, son, thank you very much.

1090
01:30:42.648 --> 01:30:45.191
No, it gives me the wind,
something terrible.

1091
01:30:49.321 --> 01:30:51.697
We are moving! We are moving!

1092
01:30:55.869 --> 01:30:58.830
New York, here we come!

1093
01:31:11.468 --> 01:31:13.928
Come in, my child, join the party.

1094
01:31:14.721 --> 01:31:18.266
Let me see now,
you would be from Austria. Am I right?

1095
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:22.353
- No, I am Inga from Sweden.
- Sweden?

1096
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:25.439
But you're wearing lederhosen.

1097
01:31:26.692 --> 01:31:29.110
Ja, for sure, from Sweden.

1098
01:31:33.574 --> 01:31:35.992
Please to help me with my rucksack.

1099
01:31:37.911 --> 01:31:39.912
Oh yeah, sure, why not?

1100
01:32:08.442 --> 01:32:11.777
I'm hungry, man.
I have got to get something more to eat.

1101
01:32:12.196 --> 01:32:15.990
Well, maybe there's some pretzels
in the bar car.

1102
01:32:33.383 --> 01:32:34.675
You're welcome!

1103
01:32:46.688 --> 01:32:50.149
- Who is that?
- Open the door, man.

1104
01:32:57.783 --> 01:33:01.035
I'm dressed as a baggage handler.

1105
01:33:01.119 --> 01:33:02.912
You can imagine
how embarrassed I was

1106
01:33:02.996 --> 01:33:04.330
when I saw that there was someone

1107
01:33:04.373 --> 01:33:06.707
at the party
with the same costume I had.

1108
01:33:06.792 --> 01:33:11.170
Monkey? Monkey?
I'm a fucking gorilla, you clown!

1109
01:33:12.631 --> 01:33:16.384
I certainly hope there's
enough space on the train for me.

1110
01:33:16.468 --> 01:33:20.054
Nanga, Nanga Eboko, from Cameroon.

1111
01:33:20.138 --> 01:33:22.890
Do you remember me?
It's Lionel Joseph.

1112
01:33:23.684 --> 01:33:28.479
Lionel, from the African
Education Conference, right?

1113
01:33:28.522 --> 01:33:31.691
Yes, aye, man.
I was director of cultural events

1114
01:33:31.775 --> 01:33:33.567
at the Haile Selassie pavilion.

1115
01:33:33.652 --> 01:33:36.362
I remember the pavilion.
We had big fun there.

1116
01:33:52.004 --> 01:33:54.380
Now that we are all here,
we will have a picnic, ja?

1117
01:33:54.423 --> 01:33:55.464
Yeah.

1118
01:33:55.549 --> 01:33:59.051
You will help me get my rucksack down
for the Swedish meatballs.

1119
01:34:03.974 --> 01:34:06.559
- Remember the one we did?
- Yeah.

1120
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.817
- The memories.
- All day long I could tell those stories.

1121
01:34:14.901 --> 01:34:17.903
- Those were the good ones, man.
- The good old days, man.

1122
01:34:18.155 --> 01:34:20.281
There you are, sweet pea.

1123
01:34:24.077 --> 01:34:27.079
So the train will be pulling
into Philadelphia soon.

1124
01:34:27.164 --> 01:34:30.249
Will you be getting off at
the City of Brotherly Loves, Mr. Beeks?

1125
01:34:30.292 --> 01:34:32.752
Yeah, I will, but you won't,

1126
01:34:34.338 --> 01:34:35.838
Winthorpe.

1127
01:34:35.922 --> 01:34:38.841
- See if this one's empty.
- Hey, back off.

1128
01:34:38.925 --> 01:34:41.927
I'll rip out your eyes
and piss on your brain.

1129
01:34:42.262 --> 01:34:44.430
- Excuse me.
- You got it.

1130
01:34:46.141 --> 01:34:48.434
All right. On your feet. Up, let's go.

1131
01:34:48.477 --> 01:34:51.437
Bunch of fucking weirdoes!
We're going to take a little walk.

1132
01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:55.149
And don't try anything funny
or the whore loses a kidney. Let's go.

1133
01:35:22.969 --> 01:35:26.097
- No, I'm from Sweden.
- Hey, beat it.

1134
01:35:26.139 --> 01:35:30.518
Hey, I'm King Kong. I'm the biggest,
baddest boy in the jungle.

1135
01:35:30.602 --> 01:35:32.520
Get lost, you maggot.

1136
01:35:33.814 --> 01:35:36.732
Hey, who is that guy,
your father or something?

1137
01:35:41.488 --> 01:35:43.656
All right, hold it right here.

1138
01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:47.201
- Oh, honestly, Beeks.
- This is as far as we go.

1139
01:35:47.786 --> 01:35:49.995
No more cockamamie cigar smoke.

1140
01:35:50.038 --> 01:35:53.165
No more Swedish meatballs
there, tootsie.

1141
01:35:53.333 --> 01:35:56.335
And no more phony Irish whiskey.

1142
01:35:56.670 --> 01:35:59.255
No more goddamn jerky beef.

1143
01:36:00.841 --> 01:36:02.341
The party's over.

1144
01:36:02.384 --> 01:36:07.680
The party's over. Hey, come on.
What do you mean, "The party's over"?

1145
01:36:08.181 --> 01:36:11.016
It's not even 10:00, you dummy.

1146
01:36:11.101 --> 01:36:15.521
Hey, come on. Loosen up, man.
It's almost New Year's Eve.

1147
01:36:48.513 --> 01:36:51.223
Hey, look what happened to me, huh?

1148
01:37:00.108 --> 01:37:03.194
Sometimes, they look so human,
it gives you the creeps.

1149
01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.033
Boy, that other one's
getting kinda horny, ain't he?

1150
01:37:09.075 --> 01:37:12.244
Think we ought to hit him up
with the tranquillizer gun?

1151
01:37:12.537 --> 01:37:14.997
It's New Year's. Let them have their fun.

1152
01:37:17.751 --> 01:37:20.377
That black one must be the female.

1153
01:37:37.896 --> 01:37:42.775
- Where is he?
- Beeks. Are you there, Beeks?

1154
01:37:49.866 --> 01:37:51.867
I'm over here.

1155
01:37:56.122 --> 01:37:58.415
That's far enough.

1156
01:37:58.458 --> 01:38:00.834
Did you get the report?

1157
01:38:01.795 --> 01:38:03.629
Let's see the money.

1158
01:38:12.681 --> 01:38:14.473
Okay, toss it over.

1159
01:38:27.028 --> 01:38:29.029
Thank you, Beeks.

1160
01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:42.209
Wonderful news. Wonderful.

1161
01:38:42.877 --> 01:38:46.005
Beeks, Happy New Year.

1162
01:38:58.393 --> 01:39:01.604
My life savings, sir. Try not to lose it.

1163
01:39:01.688 --> 01:39:03.814
Lose it? Coleman, in a couple hours,

1164
01:39:03.857 --> 01:39:07.151
you're going to be the richest butler
that ever lived, man.

1165
01:39:10.864 --> 01:39:14.658
I worked real hard for this, Louis.
Hope you know what you're doing.

1166
01:39:15.869 --> 01:39:18.996
- Thank you, Ophelia.
- What are you doing?

1167
01:39:21.124 --> 01:39:22.875
<i>1031...</i>

1168
01:39:22.959 --> 01:39:26.045
<i>- That's us, Louis.
- ... en route to New York and Boston.</i>

1169
01:39:30.508 --> 01:39:32.843
Coleman, would you please.

1170
01:39:32.886 --> 01:39:34.845
Thank you.

1171
01:40:13.093 --> 01:40:18.097
I could use a stiff drink.
Would you care to join me?

1172
01:40:44.624 --> 01:40:47.042
- Good morning, Mr. Duke.
- Wilson.

1173
01:40:47.377 --> 01:40:49.378
- Good morning, Mr. Duke.
- Wilson.

1174
01:41:01.599 --> 01:41:03.600
Keep the change.

1175
01:41:05.061 --> 01:41:08.147
Think big, think positive.
Never show any sign of weakness.

1176
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:09.648
Always go for the throat.

1177
01:41:09.733 --> 01:41:13.527
Buy low, sell high.
Fear, that's the other guy's problem.

1178
01:41:14.404 --> 01:41:15.946
Nothing you have ever experienced

1179
01:41:15.989 --> 01:41:18.699
can prepare you for the unbridled
carnage you're about to witness.

1180
01:41:18.783 --> 01:41:21.660
The Super Bowl, the World Series,
they don't know what pressure is.

1181
01:41:21.703 --> 01:41:23.328
In this building,
it's either kill or be killed.

1182
01:41:23.371 --> 01:41:24.872
- That's right.
- You make no friends in the pits

1183
01:41:24.956 --> 01:41:26.123
- and you take no prisoners.
- No prisoners.

1184
01:41:26.166 --> 01:41:28.459
One minute you're up half a million
in soybeans, and the next, boom.

1185
01:41:28.501 --> 01:41:30.711
Your kids don't go to college
and they've repossessed your Bentley.

1186
01:41:30.795 --> 01:41:31.837
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

1187
01:41:31.921 --> 01:41:35.174
We've got to kill the motherfucker...
We've got to kill them.

1188
01:41:35.258 --> 01:41:39.178
We want you to buy as much OJ
as you can, the instant trading starts.

1189
01:41:39.262 --> 01:41:43.015
Don't worry if the price starts going up,
just keep buying.

1190
01:41:43.433 --> 01:41:44.892
But, gentlemen,
they're gonna broadcast

1191
01:41:44.976 --> 01:41:46.226
the crop report in an hour, what if...

1192
01:41:46.311 --> 01:41:48.437
Let us worry about that, Wilson.

1193
01:41:52.609 --> 01:41:54.026
Yes, sir.

1194
01:41:57.197 --> 01:42:01.992
- How's the ulcer, Harry?
- Pretty good. How's the hypertension?

1195
01:42:03.328 --> 01:42:05.329
Hasn't bothered me in months.

1196
01:42:33.066 --> 01:42:34.983
Let's kick some ass.

1197
01:42:56.381 --> 01:43:00.259
Well, this is it. The last bastion
of pure capitalism left on Earth.

1198
01:43:00.343 --> 01:43:04.513
Here in New York they trade everything,
gold, silver, platinum,

1199
01:43:04.597 --> 01:43:07.432
heating oil, propane, cocoa and sugar

1200
01:43:07.517 --> 01:43:10.936
and, of course,
frozen, concentrated orange juice.

1201
01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.729
Now, the people on the phones
are taking orders

1202
01:43:12.772 --> 01:43:15.023
from brokerage houses
all over the world.

1203
01:43:15.108 --> 01:43:19.278
The runners then hand
those orders to the traders in the pits.

1204
01:43:23.241 --> 01:43:26.910
They're trading cotton over there.
And that's the silver pit.

1205
01:43:27.287 --> 01:43:30.789
Now the Dukes' trader is going to be
buying like crazy right from the opening.

1206
01:43:30.832 --> 01:43:32.457
We'll be waiting
until he drives the price up?

1207
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:37.629
Right. I can't wait to see his face when
they broadcast that genuine crop report.

1208
01:43:37.714 --> 01:43:39.965
OJ trading opens at 9:00.

1209
01:43:40.049 --> 01:43:42.926
- Let's go kick some butt.
- Let's go.

1210
01:44:21.674 --> 01:44:23.133
-102 bid for...
- Sold!

1211
01:44:45.114 --> 01:44:48.158
Hey, hey. The Dukes are trying
to corner the market.

1212
01:44:48.201 --> 01:44:51.370
- They know something, I can feel it.
- Let's get in on it.

1213
01:44:52.664 --> 01:44:54.122
200, taken.

1214
01:44:56.292 --> 01:44:58.585
-130.
-200, 200.

1215
01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:00.545
Louis!

1216
01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:03.048
Not yet, almost.

1217
01:45:03.091 --> 01:45:05.467
-220, take them.
-209.

1218
01:45:05.551 --> 01:45:08.762
- Yeah, yeah, got them.
-139.

1219
01:45:12.475 --> 01:45:16.603
Now! Sell, 200 April at 142.

1220
01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:34.663
That's not right.
How can the price be going down?

1221
01:45:34.956 --> 01:45:37.708
Something's wrong. Where's Wilson?

1222
01:45:38.918 --> 01:45:39.918
Sell, sell, sell.

1223
01:45:40.003 --> 01:45:41.878
What are they doing here?

1224
01:45:42.588 --> 01:45:46.425
- They're selling, Mortimer.
- Why, that's ridiculous.

1225
01:45:47.927 --> 01:45:50.262
Unless that crop report...

1226
01:45:52.348 --> 01:45:54.141
God help us.

1227
01:46:03.943 --> 01:46:07.404
I told you we shouldn't have
committed everything, you asshole.

1228
01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:11.783
We've got to get Wilson
and tell him to sell.

1229
01:46:37.143 --> 01:46:40.395
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Agriculture.</i>

1230
01:46:51.324 --> 01:46:55.827
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
orange crop estimates for the next year.</i>

1231
01:47:09.926 --> 01:47:14.137
<i>After calculating the estimates from
various orange-producing states,</i>

1232
01:47:14.806 --> 01:47:16.848
<i>we have concluded the following.</i>

1233
01:47:17.517 --> 01:47:21.436
<i>The cold winter has apparently
not affected the orange harvest.</i>

1234
01:47:25.983 --> 01:47:30.362
<i>Consumers can expect
orange and orange juice prices to fall...</i>

1235
01:47:38.079 --> 01:47:40.330
Wilson, for Christ's sake, sell.

1236
01:47:52.969 --> 01:47:54.886
- Buy them.
- Sold!

1237
01:47:54.929 --> 01:47:56.972
- Sold!
- Sold!

1238
01:47:59.976 --> 01:48:01.226
Selling!

1239
01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:06.231
Selling. Sell.

1240
01:48:06.315 --> 01:48:07.315
Sold!

1241
01:48:08.943 --> 01:48:10.485
36!

1242
01:48:11.154 --> 01:48:12.154
25!

1243
01:48:17.743 --> 01:48:20.036
Selling.

1244
01:48:20.705 --> 01:48:24.291
All right. I'll buy. 15.

1245
01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.797
Wilson, where are you going?

1246
01:48:30.923 --> 01:48:35.760
You idiot.
Get back in there at once and sell, sell.

1247
01:48:36.512 --> 01:48:40.182
But I... I've just... I've...

1248
01:48:48.608 --> 01:48:50.609
-5.
- Yeah, 200. Thank you, brother.

1249
01:48:50.693 --> 01:48:53.570
-100.
- Yeah, that was 100.

1250
01:48:53.613 --> 01:48:54.863
- So did you get the hundred?
- I got that.

1251
01:48:54.947 --> 01:48:56.656
- Five with you, man, five.
- Louis, that was 100 lots.

1252
01:48:56.741 --> 01:48:58.241
Hundred?

1253
01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:16.301
Happy New Year.

1254
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:20.555
- Winthorpe.
- Valentine.

1255
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.476
- Hey, how'd you all make out today?
- How could you do this to us,

1256
01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.770
after everything we've done for you?

1257
01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.273
Oh, see, I made Louis a bet here.

1258
01:49:30.316 --> 01:49:32.275
Louis bet me
that we couldn't both get rich

1259
01:49:32.318 --> 01:49:34.110
and put you all in the poorhouse
at the same time.

1260
01:49:34.153 --> 01:49:37.030
He didn't think we could do it. I won.

1261
01:49:37.281 --> 01:49:39.282
I lost.

1262
01:49:40.952 --> 01:49:43.828
- $1.
- Thank you, Louis.

1263
01:49:44.163 --> 01:49:46.164
- After you.
- Certainly.

1264
01:49:50.503 --> 01:49:52.337
Margin call, gentlemen.

1265
01:49:52.421 --> 01:49:53.588
Why, you can't expect us to...

1266
01:49:53.673 --> 01:49:55.882
You know
the rules of the exchange, Mr. Duke.

1267
01:49:55.967 --> 01:49:59.177
All accounts to be settled
at the end of the day's trading,

1268
01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:00.762
without exception.

1269
01:50:00.846 --> 01:50:05.016
You know perfectly well,
we don't have $394 million in cash.

1270
01:50:05.059 --> 01:50:06.851
I'm sorry, boys.

1271
01:50:06.894 --> 01:50:10.355
Put the Duke brothers' seats
on the exchange up for sale at once.

1272
01:50:10.398 --> 01:50:13.650
Seize all assets
of Duke & Duke commodities brokers,

1273
01:50:13.693 --> 01:50:17.112
as well as all personal holdings
of Randolph and Mortimer Duke.

1274
01:50:17.196 --> 01:50:20.573
My God, we're ruined.

1275
01:50:20.783 --> 01:50:23.660
This is an outrage.
I demand an investigation.

1276
01:50:24.203 --> 01:50:25.912
You can't sell our seats.

1277
01:50:25.997 --> 01:50:28.790
A Duke has been sitting
on this exchange since it was founded.

1278
01:50:28.874 --> 01:50:30.917
We founded this exchange. It's ours.

1279
01:50:31.002 --> 01:50:32.919
- It belongs to us.
- My God.

1280
01:50:34.338 --> 01:50:36.381
Mortimer, your brother's not well.
We'd better call an ambulance.

1281
01:50:36.465 --> 01:50:40.343
Fuck him! Now you listen to me.
I want trading reopened, right now.

1282
01:50:40.386 --> 01:50:44.597
Get those brokers back in here!
Turn those machines back on!

1283
01:50:44.682 --> 01:50:47.559
Turn those machines back on!

1284
01:50:51.647 --> 01:50:55.066
You and your Nobel Prize, you idiot!

1285
01:50:55.192 --> 01:50:59.195
Where's Beeks?
Where in hell is Beeks?

1286
01:50:59.238 --> 01:51:01.990
- Beeks!
- Yeah, I forgot all about that guy.

1287
01:51:11.334 --> 01:51:13.084
Okay, one male gorilla.

1288
01:51:13.127 --> 01:51:15.962
Hey, wait a minute.
There's two of them in that cage.

1289
01:51:16.047 --> 01:51:18.089
One gorilla, two gorillas. Big deal.

1290
01:51:18.132 --> 01:51:19.883
The whole bunch is getting sent
back to Africa.

1291
01:51:19.925 --> 01:51:21.634
It's a big scientific experiment.

1292
01:51:21.719 --> 01:51:24.679
What do I know?
Anyway, take a look, they're in love.

1293
01:51:45.659 --> 01:51:48.203
- Hey, Coleman!
- Yes?

1294
01:51:49.622 --> 01:51:52.665
What shall we do about lunch?
The lobster or the cracked crab?

1295
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:56.294
- What do you think?
- Can't we have both?

1296
01:51:56.754 --> 01:51:58.171
Why not?

1297
01:51:58.255 --> 01:52:00.173
- Demitri.
- Sir.

1298
01:52:00.383 --> 01:52:05.387
- Lobster and cracked crab for everyone.
- Extra primo good, Mr. Coleman, sir.

1299
01:52:15.147 --> 01:52:17.482
Looking good, Billy Ray.

1300
01:52:18.317 --> 01:52:20.902
Feeling good, Louis.
