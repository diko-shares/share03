00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.448
Honey?

2
00:01:57.482 --> 00:01:59.117
Honey!

3
00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:02.988
Honey!

4
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.959
Honey!

5
00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:10.128
Jesus Christ.

6
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:11.430
Honey!

7
00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:12.997
What is this?

8
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:15.334
It's the skin. Oh!

9
00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:17.102
- What?
- Shh!

10
00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:19.304
Oh! It's the missing piece!

11
00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:21.572
All these years,
I was trying to synthesize it,

12
00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:23.040
but it was never gonna work.

13
00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.010
Mother nature had it
all figured out.

14
00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:26.211
Figured what out?

15
00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:29.214
He's not a viable subject.

16
00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:31.048
I mean, the genes are there.

17
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.985
Oh sweetie, but there's
not enough of them.

18
00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.954
Sorry.

19
00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:38.156
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

20
00:02:38.188 --> 00:02:39.524
What are you doing?

21
00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:43.661
Everything I need to finish
my work is in the skin.

22
00:02:46.097 --> 00:02:48.200
Do you love me?

23
00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.335
What? Yes, of co... course I do.

24
00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.638
This is the only way.

25
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:55.973
It's what needs to happen.

26
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.510
This is my legacy.

27
00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:05.484
I need your support in this.

28
00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:07.286
Are you with me?

29
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.022
Where did he come from?

30
00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:14.359
The most amazing maze!

31
00:03:14.391 --> 00:03:16.228
Mwah!

32
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.097
He lost his friends.

33
00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.699
And I said I could
help him find the exit.

34
00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:25.137
It was so easy!

35
00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.470
It was so easy.

36
00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:29.540
We should be able to do
this all the time.

37
00:03:29.574 --> 00:03:33.145
You... you want to take
customers from the maze?

38
00:03:33.177 --> 00:03:35.614
Honey, just one or two.

39
00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:37.715
Herschel, it's in the skin!

40
00:03:37.748 --> 00:03:39.717
It's like red hair.

41
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.253
- Red hair?
- Yes!

42
00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:43.688
Two percent of the population

43
00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:45.290
have the mc1r gene.

44
00:03:45.323 --> 00:03:47.558
That's the gene that
causes them to have red hair.

45
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:50.194
This must work the same way.

46
00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:54.533
Some humans have more of
this gene, and some do not.

47
00:03:54.566 --> 00:04:01.173
If I can find the ones that have
more, my formula will work.

48
00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:04.643
We need to find them, herschel.

49
00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:08.714
This is a gift from god.

50
00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:10.214
It's all here.

51
00:04:10.247 --> 00:04:13.584
The maze, solving the puzzle.

52
00:04:13.617 --> 00:04:17.021
He wants us to do this.

53
00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:19.992
God is behind us.

54
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.499
- No.
- Do this with me.

55
00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:40.678
We are in this life together.

56
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:42.447
Hmm?

57
00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:50.288
Do this with me.

58
00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:01.466
No!

59
00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.711
Do this with me.

60
00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.078
Oh, honey.

61
00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.379
Honey.

62
00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:50.415
It's okay. It's okay.

63
00:05:50.447 --> 00:05:53.651
It's... it's just like
hunting, huh?

64
00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:27.351
<i>It's our summer sales event.</i>

65
00:06:27.384 --> 00:06:28.519
<i>Free in-home trial.</i>

66
00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:31.523
<i>Free delivery.</i>

67
00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:34.767
- You got this, Mr. Herschel?
- Uh-huh.

68
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.694
All right, back in 10.

69
00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:48.439
15 years ago, my lovely wife,
Florence, may she rest in peace,

70
00:06:48.473 --> 00:06:51.776
stumbled upon a breakthrough
in the human aging process,

71
00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.579
and after an incredible
discovery by my lovely daughter

72
00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:57.549
Gemma here,
Florence's miracle face cream

73
00:06:57.581 --> 00:06:59.584
doesn't just stop
the aging process.

74
00:06:59.617 --> 00:07:01.486
Oh no, no, no. It reverses it.

75
00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:03.355
Now, I know what you're
thinking.

76
00:07:03.387 --> 00:07:05.723
You're thinking this is
some sort of malarkey, hogwash,

77
00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.393
that I'll promise you the moon
and never deliver.

78
00:07:08.425 --> 00:07:10.495
I'll let you see for yourself.

79
00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:11.830
Star wipe!

80
00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:17.702
Florence's miracle face cream

81
00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:21.573
uses medical discoveries
from nine different patents.

82
00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:23.942
And we guarantee that
if you don't see results

83
00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:25.644
in the first two weeks,

84
00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:28.613
you can send it back
and receive a full refund.

85
00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:31.415
And now, you can order
Florence's miracle face cream

86
00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:34.786
for the low, low
introductory price of $29.99.

87
00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:36.888
Now, if you order
in the next 60 minutes,

88
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.925
I won't send you <i>one</i> jar of
Florence's miracle face cream.

89
00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:41.926
No way! I'll send you two jars.

90
00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:44.662
That's <i>two</i> jars of
Florence's miracle face cream!

91
00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:49.268
Let's look at some more
satisfied customers, shall we?

92
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.314
Help!

93
00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:44.422
Mind your breath.

94
00:08:44.456 --> 00:08:45.925
Release when ready.

95
00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.631
Steady your breathing.

96
00:08:52.664 --> 00:08:54.900
That'll keep your arm
from shaking.

97
00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:57.569
If you pull your shot an inch
and release,

98
00:08:57.602 --> 00:09:00.573
you'll be off target
10 feet as it travels.

99
00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:05.711
Pick your target.

100
00:09:08.613 --> 00:09:11.750
Breathe.

101
00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:13.586
Release when ready.

102
00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:27.699
Is that it?

103
00:09:27.732 --> 00:09:29.568
You tell me.

104
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:32.404
Quiet the forest and listen.

105
00:09:51.622 --> 00:09:53.092
All right. Enough of that noise.

106
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:56.395
Let's talk inventory.

107
00:09:56.428 --> 00:10:00.433
Well, doing pretty good.

108
00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:04.337
We have enough subjects
to get us over the hump.

109
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.539
It'd be easier with more.

110
00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.039
No, no, no, no, no, no.

111
00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:09.542
No.

112
00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:12.944
We are going to lower
the risk factor.

113
00:10:12.977 --> 00:10:15.414
I mean, how many people can
we grab from this maze

114
00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:16.849
without someone
coming and looking?

115
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:19.684
I know, I know, but we're really
riding a thin line here.

116
00:10:19.717 --> 00:10:23.856
Yes, and there are other risks
involved, as well.

117
00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:26.424
Henry's dead.

118
00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:27.892
I lost your mother.
I lost a son.

119
00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:31.796
I'm not gonna risk
losing anyone else.

120
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:33.565
So we're gonna lower
the risk factor, okay?

121
00:10:33.598 --> 00:10:35.867
Can you just do that
for me, please?

122
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.439
I can do that.

123
00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:41.841
Good. Thank you.

124
00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:45.077
You are a stubborn
son of a bitch like your mother.

125
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.145
Dad!

126
00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.832
Aah! What the hell?!

127
00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.523
Oh.

128
00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:06.624
I-It's okay, everyone!

129
00:12:06.658 --> 00:12:07.993
That's the bear alarm.

130
00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:10.628
Now, sometimes,
albeit very rarely,

131
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.864
those darn bears make it
into the dumpsters.

132
00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.633
Nothing to worry about.

133
00:12:14.665 --> 00:12:16.034
Well-oiled machine?

134
00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.236
Get in the maze
and find out what's going on.

135
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.904
You think they got out
of the compound?

136
00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:21.783
I doubt it, but I need you
to find out what's going on.

137
00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.909
The farthest any runner's
gotten is quadrant 9.

138
00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:26.678
We're not supposed to have
runners to begin with.

139
00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:30.982
Finding competent employees
isn't exactly easy.

140
00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:34.118
The traps aren't active
during business hours.

141
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:37.188
Then I guess
it's the old-fashioned way.

142
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.626
Besides, how am I supposed
to keep up my a-game

143
00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:43.161
without the occasional runner?

144
00:12:43.194 --> 00:12:44.930
Be careful!

145
00:12:50.001 --> 00:12:51.203
Hey, Chris!

146
00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:53.005
It's coley.

147
00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:58.110
Hey idiots, kill the alarm.

148
00:12:58.143 --> 00:12:59.879
What do we know?

149
00:12:59.911 --> 00:13:01.646
<i>Someone got out.</i>

150
00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:05.251
Yes, I know that, Andy!
Where are they?

151
00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:08.587
<i>In the maze.</i>

152
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.989
What?

153
00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:19.231
Get out of my way!

154
00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:22.067
It looks so real!

155
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.302
It's okay, everyone!

156
00:13:23.334 --> 00:13:25.702
Just... just the actors
in the maze!

157
00:13:25.736 --> 00:13:27.573
It's all it is.

158
00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:49.160
Stay here.

159
00:13:49.193 --> 00:13:51.630
Keep the crowd calm.

160
00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.977
Oof!

161
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.345
Shit!

162
00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.894
- Jesus!
- I'm Gavin. I'm from Ohio.

163
00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.062
Yes!

164
00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:25.698
Gavin, I know that!

165
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.665
Just...

166
00:14:27.698 --> 00:14:29.233
Keep up the good work.

167
00:14:37.342 --> 00:14:39.111
- Yah!
- Oh!

168
00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.818
Can't believe it.

169
00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:48.821
It's fantast...
Oh, what is that one?

170
00:14:48.853 --> 00:14:51.089
Let's check it out.

171
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.672
We get 'em?

172
00:15:06.704 --> 00:15:08.239
Was there any doubt we wouldn't?

173
00:15:08.273 --> 00:15:10.242
And the patrons?

174
00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:12.010
Like it never happened.

175
00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.380
- Family meeting.
- But I...

176
00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.981
Now!

177
00:16:10.935 --> 00:16:12.804
What the fuck?

178
00:16:12.837 --> 00:16:14.372
What the fuck?!

179
00:16:14.405 --> 00:16:16.140
What the fuck?! What the...

180
00:16:16.174 --> 00:16:17.443
What the fuck?!

181
00:16:56.981 --> 00:16:58.884
Shh! It's okay.

182
00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.063
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

183
00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:03.455
It's gonna be okay. Okay?

184
00:17:03.487 --> 00:17:04.957
We're gonna get out of here.

185
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.226
We're gonna get out of here.

186
00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.794
Right?

187
00:17:30.414 --> 00:17:32.017
Holy shit!

188
00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:34.318
All right, everyone.
Gather around.

189
00:17:34.351 --> 00:17:36.220
Gather around.

190
00:17:36.253 --> 00:17:39.857
I think we should start this
meeting off with some good news.

191
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:43.862
We had over 100,000
orders today.

192
00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:49.867
And I want to thank
all of you so very much

193
00:17:49.901 --> 00:17:51.537
for making
Florence's miracle face cream

194
00:17:51.569 --> 00:17:53.806
the success that, uh...

195
00:17:53.838 --> 00:17:56.207
That my girl always
knew it would be.

196
00:17:56.241 --> 00:18:00.011
Now, we got enough subjects
to fulfill that order,

197
00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.281
but it's gonna be tight.

198
00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:04.016
All right?

199
00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:08.086
We got to start harvesting
the minute them subjects arrive.

200
00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:10.888
So you both got taken together?

201
00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:14.026
Yeah, some dickhead in a mask
with a chainsaw

202
00:18:14.058 --> 00:18:17.962
cut my boyfriend in half,
and, uh, then he hit me.

203
00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:19.530
Next thing I know,
I woke up here.

204
00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:24.102
Some guy dressed as a clown
choked me out with a dogcatcher.

205
00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:28.006
Yeah, that pussy-ass bitch
dead-ass got me, too.

206
00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.473
Nothing.

207
00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:31.310
There's not a single
cell phone anywhere.

208
00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:33.178
We just have to check
another room.

209
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:35.156
- No, we got to get out of here.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

210
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.158
And what are you gonna do when
one of those psychos finds us?

211
00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:40.018
Yeah, well, it beats staying
here waiting, now, doesn't it?

212
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.461
Hey, the deaf girl's trying
to say something.

213
00:18:41.485 --> 00:18:42.587
She isn't deaf, idiot.

214
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.922
She can't speak.

215
00:18:44.955 --> 00:18:46.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

216
00:18:46.357 --> 00:18:48.292
I suck at charades.

217
00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:50.462
I think she's saying
something about time.

218
00:18:50.494 --> 00:18:53.064
- We're running out of time?
- We don't have time for this!

219
00:18:53.097 --> 00:18:55.366
Hey, it's okay.
We can figure this out.

220
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.606
- Sipping tea?
- Fuckin' what?

221
00:19:01.639 --> 00:19:04.175
Um, smoking. Smoking?

222
00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:05.344
Blazing?

223
00:19:05.376 --> 00:19:07.011
You want to get high right now?

224
00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:09.948
Come on, we gotta go!

225
00:19:09.981 --> 00:19:11.183
Vagina?

226
00:19:11.215 --> 00:19:12.917
Dude, what are you
talking about?

227
00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:14.586
A vagina looks like this.

228
00:19:14.618 --> 00:19:17.422
- Gross!
- I'm just saying.

229
00:19:17.454 --> 00:19:19.223
Blazing? Uh...

230
00:19:19.257 --> 00:19:20.424
Blaze?

231
00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:23.428
Okay, Blaze. Um, fire.

232
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:27.231
Uh, wave? Mountain?

233
00:19:27.264 --> 00:19:29.367
"M"?

234
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.036
"M," Blaze.

235
00:19:31.068 --> 00:19:33.305
Blaze, "m."

236
00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:34.906
- Blazem.
- Blazem.

237
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.642
- Blazem.
- Maze.

238
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.279
Oh, my god, I got it!

239
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:44.950
Fuck me.

240
00:19:44.982 --> 00:19:47.152
Wait, what? Why is that
such a big deal?

241
00:19:47.184 --> 00:19:49.187
We're still inside the maze.

242
00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:54.425
Now, I think y'all know me
well enough to know

243
00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:58.529
that I don't like to
bring up issues,

244
00:19:58.562 --> 00:20:04.001
point fingers, and place blame
at certain individuals.

245
00:20:04.035 --> 00:20:09.007
However, we had ourselves
a runner today.

246
00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:12.644
And I think we should talk
about best practices.

247
00:20:12.676 --> 00:20:15.146
Now, the traps are active now.

248
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.049
However, they are not active

249
00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:19.517
during regular hours
of operation.

250
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:24.322
People, we cannot afford to have
a runner during farm hours.

251
00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:29.161
We are this close to finalizing
a deal with the Japanese,

252
00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:33.164
so we need to stay accountable.

253
00:20:33.197 --> 00:20:34.299
Andy!

254
00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:40.739
I asked you to gather around
all the essential employees.

255
00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:42.473
I-I did.

256
00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:44.042
Well, I can see that.

257
00:20:44.075 --> 00:20:46.311
I can see that, Andy.

258
00:20:46.344 --> 00:20:48.647
But it looks
like <i>everybody's</i> here.

259
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.648
Yeah.

260
00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:50.982
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:52.952
Let me ask you a question.

262
00:20:54.519 --> 00:21:01.226
Do you feel that everyone
is an essential employee?

263
00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:03.761
Uh...

264
00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:05.364
Yeah.

265
00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:08.265
And that's why we're having
this conversation.

266
00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:10.735
So let me ask you this.

267
00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:14.338
If everyone is here...

268
00:21:14.372 --> 00:21:15.273
Yeah.

269
00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:17.342
Who, pray-tell,
is watching the subjects

270
00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:20.078
so we don't have a repeat
of what happened this afternoon?

271
00:21:21.712 --> 00:21:23.581
Come on, light bulb.

272
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.083
Come on.

273
00:21:25.116 --> 00:21:27.085
Just give me one little flicker.

274
00:21:27.117 --> 00:21:29.487
One little flicker.

275
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.589
There you go!

276
00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.092
- What?
- Go!

277
00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:35.760
Go!

278
00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.174
No, no, no, no!

279
00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:58.116
Now, I look around this room

280
00:21:58.148 --> 00:22:01.352
and I see a bunch
of hardworking dreamers.

281
00:22:01.385 --> 00:22:03.654
Dreamers that have
helped me achieve-

282
00:22:08.693 --> 00:22:10.127
Andy!

283
00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:13.131
I have to go to the bathroom.

284
00:22:13.164 --> 00:22:15.099
Come back here, boy.

285
00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:21.273
Kevin runs in here in a panic,

286
00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:23.542
and all of a sudden,
you stand up.

287
00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:27.645
You know what I want
for Christmas?

288
00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.647
A horse?

289
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.414
No.

290
00:22:30.447 --> 00:22:32.817
Shoes?

291
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.821
I want you to own your fuck-up.

292
00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.290
I want you to put him in a box,

293
00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:44.296
wrap him up,
and put it under the tree.

294
00:22:44.328 --> 00:22:46.431
Now, what did he whisper to you?

295
00:22:46.463 --> 00:22:48.799
What'd that little man
whisper to you?

296
00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:52.837
They all escaped.

297
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.206
- How could this happen?
- Yeah, it can't.

298
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.708
They were in
medically induced comas.

299
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:58.752
- Well, how far do you think they got?
- Hard to say.

300
00:22:58.776 --> 00:23:00.846
We don't know how long
they've been awake.

301
00:23:00.878 --> 00:23:02.313
Well, did they get out
of the maze?

302
00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:04.182
I doubt it,
especially with the traps.

303
00:23:04.214 --> 00:23:06.818
Ah, shit. The traps.
How about our inventory?

304
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.820
We can deliver almost all the
orders, but it'll clear us out.

305
00:23:09.854 --> 00:23:13.125
All right, so we'll just put
all new orders on back-order

306
00:23:13.157 --> 00:23:14.693
and we'll count our losses.

307
00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:15.893
Wait, what?

308
00:23:15.926 --> 00:23:17.395
I'm thinking about exposure now.

309
00:23:17.427 --> 00:23:18.796
What about preservation?

310
00:23:18.829 --> 00:23:20.899
I <i>am</i> thinking about
preservation... ours.

311
00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:23.769
Now, we got the traps so we
wouldn't have to wrangle 'em up.

312
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:26.338
Yeah, we could lose everything!
The traps will kill them!

313
00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:28.173
You don't think
I don't know that?

314
00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:29.817
We found them before.
We'll find them again.

315
00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:32.544
But none of that matters
if we're in jail or worse.

316
00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:35.481
So just wrangle 'em up,
or let the traps get 'em.

317
00:23:35.513 --> 00:23:36.848
I don't care.

318
00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:38.918
But whatever you do,
do not engage

319
00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:41.688
unless absolutely necessary.

320
00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:45.257
She's with them.

321
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.567
Yeah, even more reason we need
to make sure that we...

322
00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:48.393
Why are we having this argument?

323
00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.896
You know my wishes.

324
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.665
Now go.

325
00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:56.902
We are not fucking
standing down, are we?

326
00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.670
What do you think?

327
00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:02.942
Hey, hey, buddy.

328
00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:04.843
I'm gonna need you to stay here

329
00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:06.579
and watch the compound, okay?

330
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.513
But I want to play
"'chase the kids"!

331
00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:09.515
I know you do.

332
00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:12.551
But your training
isn't complete, young jedi.

333
00:24:12.585 --> 00:24:16.756
Besides, someone's got to
guard the base, right?

334
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:18.223
Please?

335
00:24:18.257 --> 00:24:19.659
Okay.

336
00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:20.926
Okay.

337
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.929
We'll be back soon. Machete up!

338
00:24:24.562 --> 00:24:27.732
Okay, now guard this place.
It's a very important job.

339
00:24:27.765 --> 00:24:29.301
You can count on me.

340
00:24:29.335 --> 00:24:30.770
I know.

341
00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:50.555
What are you doing? We gotta go!

342
00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:51.656
Where?

343
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.735
We don't even know if we're
heading in or further out.

344
00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:55.493
No, no, no. No, no.
None of that matters.

345
00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:57.005
- If we stay here, we die.
- Well, she's right.

346
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:58.872
How do we know we're not
heading right for one of them?

347
00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:00.765
Oh, so your genius idea
is to what? Stand here?

348
00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.568
And your genius idea is to yell?

349
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.512
Look, we need to pick
a direction and stick to it.

350
00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.772
Okay, look, right there.
We can follow that sign.

351
00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:09.308
She's trying
to tell us something.

352
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.843
You want us to cut through
the corn stalk?

353
00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:13.346
How is that gonna help?

354
00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:16.648
Because the paths...
They twist and turn.

355
00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:20.252
If we run down the stalk,
it's a straight line.

356
00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:22.321
It's a good enough reason
for me.

357
00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.323
All right. Fuck it. Let's go.

358
00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:55.921
Hey! Check it out!
I found a pipe!

359
00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:59.392
That's rebar.

360
00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:06.931
We have to do something!

361
00:26:06.964 --> 00:26:08.867
- It's not gonna open!
- Stop!

362
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.503
Stop!

363
00:26:11.537 --> 00:26:13.572
Um, I'm gonna head back. Okay?

364
00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:15.473
I'm sorry.
I just can't wait here to die.

365
00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:16.542
What? Morgan!

366
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.511
- I'm sorry!
- Let's go!

367
00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:21.748
I'm sorry.

368
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.852
Sorry.

369
00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:29.422
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

370
00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:30.790
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:30.822 --> 00:26:32.524
No, no.

372
00:26:32.558 --> 00:26:34.393
No. Fuck that!

373
00:26:34.425 --> 00:26:37.329
All right? You don't
have to do this.

374
00:26:37.363 --> 00:26:38.664
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

375
00:26:38.696 --> 00:26:40.332
No, wait. Fuck, please!

376
00:26:40.366 --> 00:26:42.100
Stop!

377
00:26:42.134 --> 00:26:43.935
Aah! Fuck!

378
00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:46.806
Oh!

379
00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:48.874
Fucking black guy, huh?

380
00:26:48.906 --> 00:26:50.809
Ain't that some shit!

381
00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:15.066
Come on, we gotta get as far
away from him as possible.

382
00:27:15.099 --> 00:27:16.101
We left him.

383
00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:17.636
Shut up! We have to go.

384
00:27:17.668 --> 00:27:19.571
Look, if we get out,
we can send help.

385
00:27:19.605 --> 00:27:21.674
"If we get out"?

386
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.989
I hear that.
Can you guys hear that?

387
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:38.991
What is that?

388
00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.863
That's new.

389
00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:49.968
Oh, shit, the others are
gonna know where we are!

390
00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.565
We have to go back
through the corn!

391
00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:21.176
Are you crazy?
What about the bear traps?

392
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.768
Yeah, well, we can't stay here.

393
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.640
- I don't think he's trying to hurt us.
- What?

394
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:26.080
I think he's just
trying to corral us

395
00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.606
until the others get here.

396
00:28:27.638 --> 00:28:28.907
How is that gonna help us?

397
00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:31.411
I don't know,
but if he were trying to...

398
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.515
Looks like that was wrong!

399
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:50.730
Oh, shit!

400
00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:12.518
Is he dead?

401
00:29:15.988 --> 00:29:17.556
Oh, shit!

402
00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.967
He is now.

403
00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:33.238
What is that?

404
00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:41.713
Okay.

405
00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.748
What does the red mean?

406
00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:48.586
Okay, so we can use
this map to get out,

407
00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:49.898
but just try to stay
on the path.

408
00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:51.565
- That could work.
- What about the psychos?

409
00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:53.000
What about them?
We just took one out.

410
00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.968
- So you want to fight them?
- You got a better plan?

411
00:29:54.992 --> 00:29:56.304
We still don't know
what the red means.

412
00:29:56.328 --> 00:29:59.865
Does it matter? It's a map!

413
00:29:59.897 --> 00:30:03.601
Okay, so we have a bat,
and rebar...

414
00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:05.604
- Aha!
- And a scalpel.

415
00:30:05.636 --> 00:30:07.306
Wait. Listen to yourselves!

416
00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:09.075
- You wanna fight them?
- Guys?

417
00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:13.979
Guys?

418
00:30:14.011 --> 00:30:15.146
Guys!

419
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:21.052
- Oh, fuck!
- You gotta be kidding me!

420
00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.989
Go!

421
00:31:25.684 --> 00:31:26.885
I think we lost him.

422
00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:29.854
Okay, what do we do now?

423
00:31:29.887 --> 00:31:31.924
Yeah, we just need to stay
as quiet as possible

424
00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.691
and slowly get out of here.

425
00:31:33.724 --> 00:31:35.059
Slowly get out of here?

426
00:31:35.092 --> 00:31:36.837
How long until you think
one of them finds us?

427
00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:38.696
No, she's right.
We don't know where they are,

428
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.165
but they don't know
where we are.

429
00:31:40.197 --> 00:31:42.400
We need to make sure we're not
giving our position away.

430
00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:44.737
I don't know where we are.

431
00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:50.074
Okay, it says that we're
somewhere around...

432
00:31:50.107 --> 00:31:51.377
Here.

433
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:54.312
Okay, so we stay alert
and just stay quiet.

434
00:31:58.015 --> 00:32:00.218
Shit, shit, shit!
We have to get her out!

435
00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:05.324
Look at that light.
Okay, that's gotta be an alarm.

436
00:32:05.357 --> 00:32:06.892
We have to go!

437
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:08.860
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

438
00:32:08.894 --> 00:32:10.128
I don't want to die!

439
00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:11.963
We're not leaving
anyone else, okay?

440
00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:15.233
Speak for yourself!
I'm not gonna die here.

441
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:20.705
Okay, I'm gonna get out
and... and send help,

442
00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:22.007
I promise!

443
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.742
Stop! Wait!

444
00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:29.080
Come on, we're almost there!
We're almost there!

445
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:31.150
We're almost there!
We're almost there!

446
00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:38.389
We got it!

447
00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:39.992
Thank...

448
00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:45.196
Oh, shit. It's her!

449
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.765
'Sup?

450
00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:49.835
What are you guys,
Charlie's angels or something?

451
00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:54.706
What are you doing?!

452
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.275
Let's play.

453
00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:05.184
We gotta go!

454
00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.752
No, we should help her!

455
00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:08.753
Help her? Look at them!

456
00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:10.690
- Come on.
- Good point.

457
00:33:52.396 --> 00:33:55.833
<i>How's it going out there?</i>

458
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.837
Got one down over here.

459
00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:06.110
Yeah, we, uh...

460
00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:09.248
We got, uh,
bear trap baird back.

461
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.783
They got Seth.

462
00:34:10.816 --> 00:34:11.917
Where are you?

463
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:14.852
Quadrant 10.

464
00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:17.088
They made it to quadrant 10?

465
00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:19.124
<i>It's 10 acres per quadrant.</i>

466
00:34:19.156 --> 00:34:21.260
They still have 90 acres to go.

467
00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:24.229
Well, I-I just see...

468
00:34:24.261 --> 00:34:26.899
Four different motions
in four different quadrants.

469
00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:28.300
And I don't know which is which!

470
00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:32.570
You know what, I thought
I told you not to engage!

471
00:34:32.604 --> 00:34:35.107
Deakin and Seth were in 12.

472
00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.544
Bernard's in 8, Andy's in 9.

473
00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:40.111
Oh, okay!

474
00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:43.214
<i>So all my children
have disobeyed me.</i>

475
00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:46.117
Hey, we've been doing this
our entire lives.

476
00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:48.419
<i>We can handle it.</i>

477
00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.159
Oh, god!

478
00:34:54.191 --> 00:34:55.426
Hey!

479
00:34:55.459 --> 00:34:56.494
Jackie boy.

480
00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:58.096
Do me a favor.

481
00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.365
Keep that quiet while
I'm talking to your sister.

482
00:35:00.397 --> 00:35:01.600
Okay?

483
00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:03.569
I'm counting on you.

484
00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.040
Fuck!

485
00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:12.176
Those are expensive!

486
00:35:53.517 --> 00:35:55.186
We dead-ass made it!

487
00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:58.957
Shit!

488
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.100
Okay, we just need
to get over that fence

489
00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:10.368
without them hearing us.

490
00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:11.936
Okay.

491
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.238
You go first.

492
00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:15.240
Are you sure?

493
00:36:15.272 --> 00:36:16.975
I got this.

494
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.912
I'll distract them
and circle back.

495
00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:21.946
Are you serious?

496
00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:24.515
I think I can outrun a fat guy.

497
00:36:24.548 --> 00:36:27.251
I don't think you can say
"fat" anymore.

498
00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:29.553
Are you kidding me right now?

499
00:36:29.586 --> 00:36:31.155
I'm sorry.

500
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:33.191
It's just insensitive.

501
00:36:33.223 --> 00:36:35.993
Do you want to distract him?

502
00:36:36.026 --> 00:36:37.329
That's what I thought.

503
00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.330
So how about you let me
outrun the fat guy

504
00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:41.265
and you get your ass
over that fence.

505
00:36:41.298 --> 00:36:43.401
Okay.

506
00:36:43.435 --> 00:36:45.470
It's just my uncle has
a thyroid condition...

507
00:36:45.502 --> 00:36:47.138
Bitch, you serious?!

508
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:48.472
Whoo!

509
00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:49.942
Shit!

510
00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.511
Hey! Yo, what's up, fat boy?!

511
00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.946
She called you fat!

512
00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.682
Oh!

513
00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.517
Oh!

514
00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:11.162
Okay.

515
00:37:11.196 --> 00:37:12.531
Okay.

516
00:37:57.542 --> 00:37:59.144
Nooooo!

517
00:38:09.521 --> 00:38:12.490
Clean-up in quadrant 9.

518
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.396
You don't say.

519
00:38:57.402 --> 00:38:59.137
We shouldn't have left her.

520
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.339
We didn't have a choice.

521
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:01.507
You always have a choice.

522
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.676
Yeah, stay and die or run.

523
00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:05.744
You're just having
survivor's guilt or whatever.

524
00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:08.281
Survivor's guilt?
We're still inside the maze!

525
00:39:08.313 --> 00:39:09.681
Yeah, but we have the map.

526
00:39:09.715 --> 00:39:12.518
And last time I checked...

527
00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:13.485
Yep, still alive.

528
00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:15.487
Oh, do <i>you</i> know how to read it?

529
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.656
Because it doesn't have a
"you are here" symbol on it.

530
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.601
For all we know, we're going
further into the maze.

531
00:39:19.625 --> 00:39:21.302
Well, we know for sure
we're running further

532
00:39:21.326 --> 00:39:23.228
from those psychos,
because last time I checked,

533
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:24.496
they were back that way.

534
00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:26.173
It's okay. We're gonna
get out of this maze.

535
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.567
And we're gonna get help.

536
00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:29.376
So I'm thinking that we should
just continue straight

537
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.170
and make a right up ahead,
and that will leave us here.

538
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.572
Yeah, okay. I'm good with that.

539
00:39:33.605 --> 00:39:35.774
We have to keep our pace up.
Let's see.

540
00:39:35.808 --> 00:39:39.612
There's 208 feet in an acre,
and this is a 100-acre maze,

541
00:39:39.645 --> 00:39:43.583
which means that would be
25 acres if this was a square,

542
00:39:43.616 --> 00:39:45.717
but it's more rectangular,
which means that...

543
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.695
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Let me think.

544
00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:51.491
So it's about 5,200 feet,
which is almost a mile.

545
00:39:51.523 --> 00:39:52.458
A mile?

546
00:39:52.491 --> 00:39:54.593
Yeah, but that's walking
in a straight line.

547
00:39:54.627 --> 00:39:57.330
Which we can't do!

548
00:39:57.362 --> 00:39:59.498
Look, with all the turns
involved, I think it's about

549
00:39:59.532 --> 00:40:01.134
3 to 5 miles to get out of here.

550
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:02.335
How long will that take?

551
00:40:02.368 --> 00:40:03.703
If we walk, like an hour or two?

552
00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:04.871
Well, what if we run?

553
00:40:04.904 --> 00:40:06.339
With all the traps
this maze has,

554
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:07.873
I would caution us
against running.

555
00:40:07.907 --> 00:40:09.509
So two hours?

556
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:12.478
We have to stay alive
in this maze for two hours?

557
00:40:12.511 --> 00:40:14.480
- We've made it this far.
- This far?

558
00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:17.282
We've been in this
fucking maze for 20 minutes,

559
00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:18.726
and two of us
have already been killed.

560
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.186
Do you really think...

561
00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:23.288
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Quick, in the corn!

562
00:40:23.322 --> 00:40:25.358
No, no, no, no!
We have to run to the turn.

563
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:27.293
- We'll never make it!
- Come on!

564
00:40:32.431 --> 00:40:34.233
- Oh, my god, Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my god.

565
00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:35.501
We thought we lost you.

566
00:40:35.534 --> 00:40:38.371
Lost her? We ran away from her.

567
00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:41.674
- Sorry.
- Did you kill her?

568
00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:44.342
Okay, well, you made it out.
That's all that matters.

569
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.545
How will that help me? Us?

570
00:40:46.578 --> 00:40:49.481
Ever heard the saying
"there's strength in numbers"?

571
00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:52.417
Like "why is six
afraid of seven"?

572
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:54.387
- What?
- What?

573
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.664
- You guys haven't...
- Okay, look.

574
00:40:55.688 --> 00:40:57.264
I think we're right here,
and I'm thinking

575
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.957
we should take this path
around the maze.

576
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:01.793
What? That's like...

577
00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.428
That's, like, super long.

578
00:41:03.462 --> 00:41:05.364
Why don't we just go this way?

579
00:41:05.397 --> 00:41:08.801
Because that's exactly what
they would expect us to do.

580
00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.302
I'm not following.

581
00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:11.713
Look, if you were trying
to catch us...

582
00:41:11.737 --> 00:41:15.273
But I'm <i>not</i> trying to catch us.

583
00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.709
Pretend you're one of
the psychos chasing us.

584
00:41:17.743 --> 00:41:20.246
You would assume
that we're gonna make

585
00:41:20.279 --> 00:41:21.581
the quickest break out of here,

586
00:41:21.614 --> 00:41:24.516
so you would be waiting
for us on those paths.

587
00:41:24.549 --> 00:41:28.286
If we take the long way around,
we're sure to avoid them.

588
00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.288
Oh!

589
00:41:30.322 --> 00:41:32.992
But what if they know
that we know

590
00:41:33.025 --> 00:41:35.695
that they'd be waiting for us
on the shortest path,

591
00:41:35.728 --> 00:41:39.965
so they're actually waiting
for us on the longest path?

592
00:41:58.784 --> 00:41:59.986
Hey, hey, hey.

593
00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:01.419
You okay?

594
00:42:01.453 --> 00:42:02.887
I got blood in my eyes.

595
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.723
Oh, my god, is that it?

596
00:42:04.757 --> 00:42:06.025
It fucking hurts!

597
00:42:06.058 --> 00:42:07.994
Here, here, here, here, here.

598
00:42:08.027 --> 00:42:10.663
Let me take a look.

599
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.364
Look up for me.

600
00:42:12.398 --> 00:42:13.833
Now to the side.

601
00:42:13.866 --> 00:42:16.835
Ooh, yeah. You got a little
blood in there.

602
00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:18.037
- Get it out!
- With what?

603
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:19.481
- You have to rinse it out.
- I don't know.

604
00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:20.973
It fucking hurts!

605
00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:24.377
Oh, my god, stop being
such a baby!

606
00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:26.478
You're a fucking baby!

607
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:28.346
Look, just go back
and rinse it out.

608
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.049
- Okay?
- That's what I'm doing.

609
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:32.018
Wait. Which way did they go?

610
00:42:32.051 --> 00:42:33.619
That way!

611
00:42:33.652 --> 00:42:34.920
Thank you.

612
00:42:34.953 --> 00:42:36.288
Gemma!

613
00:42:36.322 --> 00:42:38.057
- What?
- Chainsaw.

614
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:41.661
Get your fucking own chainsaw!

615
00:42:41.694 --> 00:42:43.663
Fucking baby.

616
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:52.932
Leave her alone!

617
00:43:55.433 --> 00:43:56.835
Come get us!

618
00:43:56.869 --> 00:43:58.871
I'm good!

619
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.056
Noooo!

620
00:44:51.089 --> 00:44:52.657
Oh! Aah!

621
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.159
No!

622
00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:55.961
No!

623
00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:03.168
No! Help!

624
00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:05.170
Help! Help!

625
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:06.906
Gemma!

626
00:45:11.743 --> 00:45:13.779
<i>Dad, we got a problem.</i>

627
00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:16.514
Yeah, well we've had
a problem all night.

628
00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.216
They got Seth's map.

629
00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:19.652
<i>What?</i>

630
00:45:19.685 --> 00:45:22.020
Yeah, I just checked his body.

631
00:45:22.054 --> 00:45:23.790
Map's gone.

632
00:45:27.092 --> 00:45:28.927
Bernard's dead.

633
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.228
They killed my boy.

634
00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:32.964
<i>Yeah, she drove his own
machete into his head.</i>

635
00:45:32.998 --> 00:45:35.568
<i>Shut up, Andy!</i>

636
00:45:37.002 --> 00:45:39.672
What the hell
is going on out there?

637
00:45:39.705 --> 00:45:42.040
How come you haven't caught
or killed them all yet?

638
00:45:42.074 --> 00:45:44.210
Hey. These aren't our
usual subjects.

639
00:45:44.243 --> 00:45:47.112
They know who we are
and what we're capable of.

640
00:45:47.145 --> 00:45:48.848
<i>Hey!</i>

641
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.786
And now with the map...

642
00:45:57.188 --> 00:45:58.690
No, no, no, no, Jackie boy.

643
00:45:58.723 --> 00:46:01.626
No, no. I need you to stay put.

644
00:46:05.998 --> 00:46:07.566
Dad.

645
00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:12.570
Hey!

646
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.138
Now is not the time for crying.

647
00:46:14.172 --> 00:46:17.909
Now is the time to go hunting.

648
00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:19.177
I screwed up!

649
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.745
Yeah, Andy.

650
00:46:20.779 --> 00:46:23.114
You always screw up.
It's kinda what you do.

651
00:46:23.148 --> 00:46:26.986
But right now, I need you
to pull it together

652
00:46:27.018 --> 00:46:30.188
and get revenge.

653
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:31.857
I...

654
00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.259
I can do that.

655
00:46:41.766 --> 00:46:43.636
I know you can.

656
00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:50.975
Okay, we need to grab
Bernard's body.

657
00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:52.211
I have an idea.

658
00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.753
What the hell's
the matter with you?

659
00:47:00.786 --> 00:47:02.554
Oh, somebody actually cares.

660
00:47:02.587 --> 00:47:04.622
I got blood in my eyes.

661
00:47:04.656 --> 00:47:07.025
Things are going tits up
out there.

662
00:47:07.058 --> 00:47:09.227
Can you still fight?

663
00:47:09.261 --> 00:47:10.762
Yeah, I can fight.

664
00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:12.964
You wanna help out your old man?

665
00:47:12.998 --> 00:47:14.233
More than ever.

666
00:47:14.266 --> 00:47:16.536
Come with me.

667
00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:23.842
Hey, old friend.

668
00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:25.777
You wanna go for a ride?

669
00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.558
Yah!

670
00:48:09.054 --> 00:48:10.856
So, the entire maze

671
00:48:10.889 --> 00:48:12.758
is surrounded by
an electrified fence?

672
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.325
Dead-ass.

673
00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:16.996
So the entrance and the exit
are the only ways out of here.

674
00:48:17.029 --> 00:48:18.731
And everybody else is dead.

675
00:48:18.764 --> 00:48:20.232
Yeah, no thanks to you.

676
00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.634
Excuse you?

677
00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:23.668
Having you and
lesbian commando over here

678
00:48:23.701 --> 00:48:25.045
hanging around
didn't help save them.

679
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:26.347
What do you think
I could have done?

680
00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:27.740
Look, it doesn't matter, okay?

681
00:48:27.773 --> 00:48:29.241
We just need to get out of here.

682
00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:31.710
Ow!

683
00:48:31.743 --> 00:48:33.746
- I'll be okay.
- Yah!

684
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:38.384
Yah! Yah!

685
00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:41.319
Yah!

686
00:48:41.353 --> 00:48:43.755
That was close.

687
00:48:43.788 --> 00:48:45.724
What do we do?

688
00:48:49.161 --> 00:48:51.864
They had to have come
from the compound?

689
00:48:51.897 --> 00:48:54.099
- How does she know that?
- No, she's right.

690
00:48:54.132 --> 00:48:55.900
If they think we're headed
for the exit,

691
00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:57.869
then that's exactly
where they're headed.

692
00:48:57.902 --> 00:49:00.138
So if we look at the map,
we should be...

693
00:49:00.172 --> 00:49:02.974
Somewhere right here?
Or somewhere around here.

694
00:49:03.007 --> 00:49:04.885
Which means they're heading
in the same direction

695
00:49:04.909 --> 00:49:06.411
that we need to go.

696
00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:08.780
So you want to follow them?

697
00:49:10.215 --> 00:49:11.717
Yeah!

698
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.152
Not following the psychos
trying to kill us.

699
00:49:14.186 --> 00:49:15.796
Well, look, if they think
we're in front of them,

700
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.422
then maybe that helps us out.

701
00:49:17.456 --> 00:49:18.824
They're on fucking horses!

702
00:49:18.857 --> 00:49:20.133
If they figure out we're
behind them,

703
00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:21.469
they'll just turn around
and chase us down.

704
00:49:21.493 --> 00:49:22.994
Well, what would you prefer?

705
00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:25.163
- Is there another way out?
- I don't know!

706
00:49:25.197 --> 00:49:26.765
I think we're somewhere
over here,

707
00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:29.368
but I'm not 100% sure.

708
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.036
What about the fruit stand?

709
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:33.906
What about it? I can't see
anything over the corn.

710
00:49:33.938 --> 00:49:35.907
It's like 9 feet tall.

711
00:49:44.516 --> 00:49:45.784
Get on my shoulders.

712
00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:47.152
What?

713
00:49:47.185 --> 00:49:49.020
Get on my shoulders
and tell me what you see.

714
00:49:49.054 --> 00:49:50.389
I'm not getting
on your shoulders!

715
00:49:50.422 --> 00:49:51.790
What if you drop me?

716
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:54.926
Oh, my god!
I'm not gonna drop you.

717
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.762
What is she saying?

718
00:49:57.795 --> 00:50:00.498
I think she wants us to do
a cheerleader lift.

719
00:50:00.532 --> 00:50:02.868
- What is that?
- Oh! Never a cheerleader?

720
00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.737
Oh! Ever been punched
in your dumb-ass face?

721
00:50:08.773 --> 00:50:10.007
Fine.

722
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.110
- What is that?
- So, you just...

723
00:50:12.143 --> 00:50:14.412
Each one of you grabs a foot
and you lift,

724
00:50:14.445 --> 00:50:15.947
and you hoist me up.

725
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.749
Okay, I can do that.

726
00:50:17.782 --> 00:50:19.317
Okay.

727
00:50:19.351 --> 00:50:21.954
So just lift me up, and then
if I can see the fruit stand,

728
00:50:21.987 --> 00:50:23.197
I should be able to Gauge
whether or not

729
00:50:23.221 --> 00:50:25.424
there's another way out of here.

730
00:50:25.456 --> 00:50:27.192
Let's do it.

731
00:50:30.395 --> 00:50:31.996
Oh, hey there!

732
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.264
Shit!

733
00:50:33.297 --> 00:50:36.000
Oh, no, don't go.

734
00:50:36.034 --> 00:50:38.170
We'll be right over.

735
00:50:38.203 --> 00:50:40.438
What? What? Wha... what is it?

736
00:50:40.471 --> 00:50:42.273
Run!

737
00:50:45.009 --> 00:50:47.212
Yah!

738
00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:48.980
Yah!

739
00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.520
Yah!

740
00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.821
Yah! Yah!

741
00:50:59.958 --> 00:51:02.261
- We gotta split up!
- What?!

742
00:51:07.866 --> 00:51:10.302
Yah! Yah!

743
00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:20.846
I see it!

744
00:51:26.418 --> 00:51:27.553
Whoa, calm down!

745
00:51:27.585 --> 00:51:29.154
Back off!

746
00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:30.422
Papa!

747
00:51:30.455 --> 00:51:33.025
Jackie boy. Look at me.

748
00:51:33.058 --> 00:51:35.159
It's gonna be okay.

749
00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:36.861
- Papa!
- Let him go, please.

750
00:51:36.895 --> 00:51:38.230
He's not built for this.

751
00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:40.299
He doesn't understand
what's going on here.

752
00:51:40.331 --> 00:51:44.002
No, Jackie boy,
you just stay St... Stop!

753
00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:46.904
You stay still like
a little mouse, Jack, okay?

754
00:51:46.938 --> 00:51:50.442
Put the gun down!

755
00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:52.009
Just stay calm.

756
00:51:52.043 --> 00:51:53.912
Everybody stay calm!

757
00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.013
How do we get out of here?

758
00:51:56.047 --> 00:51:59.551
I-I'll tell you
if... if you let him go.

759
00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.018
Okay.

760
00:52:01.052 --> 00:52:02.621
Just tell us where to go.

761
00:52:02.654 --> 00:52:04.056
Don't hurt him.

762
00:52:04.089 --> 00:52:05.991
Please don't hurt him.

763
00:52:20.205 --> 00:52:23.074
It doesn't matter much, anyway.

764
00:52:23.107 --> 00:52:24.609
Go. Call the cops.

765
00:52:24.643 --> 00:52:26.445
How can we trust you?

766
00:52:26.478 --> 00:52:29.081
'Cause I'd rather spend the rest
of my life in a cage

767
00:52:29.114 --> 00:52:31.016
than Bury another son.

768
00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.520
It's down that path.

769
00:52:36.554 --> 00:52:38.123
Stay to the right.

770
00:52:39.657 --> 00:52:41.226
No!

771
00:52:41.259 --> 00:52:42.494
No!!

772
00:52:42.527 --> 00:52:44.330
What did you do?!

773
00:52:48.199 --> 00:52:50.869
Oh, Jack.

774
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.607
I'm so sorry, Jack.

775
00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:57.541
I'm so sorry.

776
00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.210
Jack.

777
00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:07.418
Who... who's that
trip-trapping over my bridge?

778
00:53:09.487 --> 00:53:11.389
You're the luckiest boy
in the world.

779
00:53:11.422 --> 00:53:13.591
You know that?

780
00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:15.427
You get to see your mama.

781
00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:19.898
You get to see your brother.

782
00:53:23.101 --> 00:53:27.005
You make sure you give your mom
a kiss for me, okay?

783
00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:28.674
No, no.

784
00:53:28.706 --> 00:53:30.275
Jack!

785
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.712
My boy.

786
00:53:34.746 --> 00:53:37.049
No, Jack.

787
00:53:40.585 --> 00:53:42.521
Dad!

788
00:53:42.554 --> 00:53:45.490
Dad, what happened?

789
00:53:45.523 --> 00:53:47.259
It's okay, son.

790
00:53:50.462 --> 00:53:53.498
They won't go far.

791
00:54:48.153 --> 00:54:51.090
Holy shit.
Did we just go in a circle?

792
00:54:53.725 --> 00:54:55.595
Well, what should we do?

793
00:54:59.131 --> 00:55:00.566
Are you serious?

794
00:55:09.274 --> 00:55:11.109
It's a good plan,

795
00:55:11.142 --> 00:55:13.412
and it's one less psycho
to worry about.

796
00:55:15.247 --> 00:55:17.082
You're the badass, right?

797
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:59.658
Hey, girl!

798
00:56:02.528 --> 00:56:05.832
Yeah, I don't think
you're walking that off.

799
00:56:05.865 --> 00:56:07.265
It's okay.

800
00:56:07.298 --> 00:56:09.201
Just let it happen.

801
00:56:12.338 --> 00:56:14.874
That's right, just let go.

802
00:56:22.615 --> 00:56:24.883
Nighty night.

803
00:56:29.354 --> 00:56:30.822
We did it!

804
00:56:30.856 --> 00:56:34.459
Yeah, we did. Pound it!

805
00:56:34.492 --> 00:56:35.594
Ha!

806
00:56:35.628 --> 00:56:37.696
Okay, take her back
to the compound.

807
00:56:37.729 --> 00:56:39.898
She still has one
good harvest left.

808
00:56:39.932 --> 00:56:43.269
I'll go after the other one.

809
00:56:43.302 --> 00:56:45.204
Oh, my god, dad. We did it!

810
00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:46.606
We got one down! It was amazing.

811
00:56:46.638 --> 00:56:47.874
You'd be so proud.

812
00:56:47.907 --> 00:56:50.609
<i>Jack's dead.</i>

813
00:56:50.642 --> 00:56:52.445
What?

814
00:56:52.477 --> 00:56:54.613
<i>She killed my boy.</i>

815
00:57:01.452 --> 00:57:02.787
Uh...

816
00:57:07.626 --> 00:57:08.828
What do I do?

817
00:57:08.861 --> 00:57:11.297
<i>I need you...</i>

818
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:13.798
<i>To get her for me.</i>

819
00:57:13.832 --> 00:57:15.268
I will.

820
00:58:25.537 --> 00:58:27.707
Help me!

821
00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:30.276
Please! Call the police!

822
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:32.245
- Help me! Help me!
- Who the hell?

823
00:58:32.278 --> 00:58:33.412
What?

824
00:58:33.445 --> 00:58:36.282
Call the fucking police,
old man!

825
00:58:36.314 --> 00:58:38.650
What the hell?

826
00:58:51.863 --> 00:58:53.298
Melanie!

827
00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:22.994
I designed this place!

828
00:59:23.028 --> 00:59:26.633
You really think you gonna
make it to the exit before me?

829
00:59:28.399 --> 00:59:30.869
That's a lot of misses.

830
00:59:30.903 --> 00:59:32.638
I didn't miss.

831
00:59:32.671 --> 00:59:38.044
You know, I've wanted to gut you
since the day I met ya.

832
00:59:38.077 --> 00:59:41.080
And after everything
you've done to me,

833
00:59:41.113 --> 00:59:43.783
I should've.

834
00:59:43.816 --> 00:59:45.551
You want this one?

835
00:59:48.887 --> 00:59:50.756
Then fucking finish it.

836
00:59:55.059 --> 00:59:56.828
Now go finish the job.

837
01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.952
Damn, girl, they skin you?

838
01:00:55.454 --> 01:00:57.055
For face cream?

839
01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.757
Where are they?

840
01:00:58.791 --> 01:01:00.892
The nearest station
is 20 miles away,

841
01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:04.929
and we got one officer
that's on duty for the night.

842
01:01:04.963 --> 01:01:07.032
But it's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

843
01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:11.003
I got the door locked,
and if anything goes wrong,

844
01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:14.139
I got a shotgun in the back.

845
01:01:14.173 --> 01:01:17.142
It's gonna be all right.

846
01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.779
Unh-unh-unh.

847
01:01:51.242 --> 01:01:52.978
That's probably them.

848
01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.919
Thought you said
there was just one.

849
01:02:00.952 --> 01:02:02.687
Come on in.

850
01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:20.738
This one's waking up.

851
01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:22.073
You know, I gotta tell ya.

852
01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:25.577
I almost had myself
a heart attack.

853
01:02:25.611 --> 01:02:27.813
I saw our whole empire
going up in smoke.

854
01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:29.581
Oh, psh, I wasn't worried.

855
01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:30.950
Really?

856
01:02:30.983 --> 01:02:33.552
No, I was so nervous,
I peed my pants a little bit.

857
01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:34.887
Ew! Gross, dad!

858
01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:36.588
What? It was just a little bit.

859
01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:38.491
You know, at my age,
things don't seem to hold.

860
01:02:38.524 --> 01:02:40.259
Oh, my god, can we not?

861
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:41.826
- What?
- Please?

862
01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:43.538
You don't want to talk
about your father's health?

863
01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:45.965
- Aw, maybe I'll get Andy to...
- You know that's not it.

864
01:02:45.997 --> 01:02:48.099
Oh, good, they're waking up.

865
01:02:50.202 --> 01:02:52.171
Well, howdy-do!

866
01:02:53.738 --> 01:02:55.073
Morning, everyone!

867
01:02:56.608 --> 01:02:58.910
You know, a lot's changed

868
01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:02.847
since the... the last time
you were conscious.

869
01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:04.716
You wanna tell them, or shall I?

870
01:03:04.749 --> 01:03:06.584
Well, I don't think
we really need...

871
01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.786
- Come on, tell them.
- Ugh, fine.

872
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.923
- Tell them!
- Since you guys...

873
01:03:10.956 --> 01:03:13.158
We sewed your eyes
and mouths shut!

874
01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.595
Shut up, Andy.

875
01:03:19.898 --> 01:03:22.200
Except for you.

876
01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.802
Oh, no, no, no.

877
01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:25.838
We couldn't... we couldn't
sew your mouth shut

878
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:28.541
because, you know, the whole...

879
01:03:28.573 --> 01:03:30.142
Your skin has more of this gene

880
01:03:30.175 --> 01:03:33.312
than we have ever
encountered before.

881
01:03:33.345 --> 01:03:35.548
That's why we need
to keep you alive.

882
01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:37.082
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

883
01:03:37.115 --> 01:03:40.586
No, no, no.

884
01:03:40.619 --> 01:03:42.521
Let's talk about this.

885
01:03:43.689 --> 01:03:46.825
- Fuck you!
- No!

886
01:03:50.128 --> 01:03:54.867
But I did... I did want you
to see all the pain you caused

887
01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:58.303
from your little jailbreak.

888
01:04:03.975 --> 01:04:06.778
You know, people, this is...
This is good work.

889
01:04:06.812 --> 01:04:08.180
This is scary.

890
01:04:08.213 --> 01:04:09.848
This is really scary.

891
01:04:09.881 --> 01:04:12.651
This'd give anybody nightmares.

892
01:04:12.684 --> 01:04:14.186
Well done!

893
01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:18.256
Oh, damn.

894
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:19.724
They can cry?

895
01:04:19.758 --> 01:04:22.026
Yeah, it's not an airtight seal.

896
01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:23.995
I didn't know that,
okay, brainiac?

897
01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:26.231
I told you to sew their eyes
and mouths shut,

898
01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:28.733
I didn't know what exactly
what that'd entail.

899
01:04:28.767 --> 01:04:30.178
Do you really wanna
leave them here awake?

900
01:04:30.202 --> 01:04:32.838
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.039
I want her to see all the...

902
01:04:35.073 --> 01:04:37.743
I want her to see everything.

903
01:04:39.644 --> 01:04:42.914
Did you think all
the things you did today

904
01:04:42.948 --> 01:04:46.118
were gonna go unpunished?

905
01:04:46.151 --> 01:04:50.155
Everything you did today.

906
01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:53.992
All my boys are gone
because of you.

907
01:04:54.026 --> 01:04:57.229
You think that was gonna
go unpunished?

908
01:04:59.097 --> 01:05:00.265
Okay!

909
01:05:00.298 --> 01:05:02.667
Your turn.

910
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.972
Okay, so...

911
01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.707
We sewed your eyes
and mouths shut,

912
01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.283
just in case you ever tried
to run again.

913
01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:12.977
It's pretty hard to, you know,
see where you're going or yell

914
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.813
for help if you...
Well, you get the idea.

915
01:05:15.847 --> 01:05:18.816
But then I thought
about it more,

916
01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:22.720
and I realized you don't
actually need to be able

917
01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:25.923
to walk in order
to be harvested.

918
01:05:25.957 --> 01:05:27.259
So...

919
01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:28.427
Mm...

920
01:05:28.459 --> 01:05:30.128
Oh, I don't wanna spoil it.

921
01:05:30.162 --> 01:05:31.930
Oh, let me think.

922
01:05:31.963 --> 01:05:34.867
Oh, I got it.

923
01:05:34.899 --> 01:05:37.135
Eeny, meeny...

924
01:05:37.169 --> 01:05:39.705
miny, mun.

925
01:05:39.738 --> 01:05:42.374
Catch a subject
who tries to run.

926
01:05:43.908 --> 01:05:45.878
Bring them back,
and when you're done,

927
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:48.680
break their ankles just for fun!

928
01:05:48.713 --> 01:05:50.749
That one!

929
01:06:01.927 --> 01:06:05.898
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

930
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:07.432
Let's just, um... yeah.

931
01:06:07.466 --> 01:06:10.436
Let's just put that on...
On hold for a while.

932
01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:13.271
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

933
01:06:13.305 --> 01:06:14.773
Oh!

934
01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.774
Did you see that?

935
01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:20.778
Wow.

936
01:06:20.812 --> 01:06:24.049
Do you see the pain
that you've caused?

937
01:06:24.082 --> 01:06:26.185
Huh? Let me ask you something.

938
01:06:26.218 --> 01:06:28.220
Was it worth it?

939
01:06:28.253 --> 01:06:31.090
Was it worth three of my boys?

940
01:06:32.524 --> 01:06:34.226
Yeah.

941
01:06:34.258 --> 01:06:37.195
You see that pretty girl
right there?

942
01:06:37.229 --> 01:06:39.263
That's my daughter.

943
01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:41.199
She saved your life twice.

944
01:06:41.233 --> 01:06:44.135
Once, when I wanted to gut you.

945
01:06:44.169 --> 01:06:47.306
The second time, when you
slit your own damn throat.

946
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.811
And this is how you repay us?

947
01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:55.046
Huh. Wow.

948
01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:59.951
Oh, I have been wanting
to do this

949
01:06:59.984 --> 01:07:02.921
for a real, real long time.

950
01:07:02.954 --> 01:07:04.256
Hey, wait! What are you doing?

951
01:07:04.289 --> 01:07:07.426
Oh, the only thing
you can do with a wolf.

952
01:07:07.459 --> 01:07:09.161
She's patient zero.

953
01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:11.529
She's the only one
we ever found.

954
01:07:11.562 --> 01:07:14.365
All my boys are dead
because of her.

955
01:07:14.399 --> 01:07:18.203
It took me 15 years
to find someone like her.

956
01:07:18.236 --> 01:07:21.106
I'm still trying to figure out
if I can synthesize her genes.

957
01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:23.374
And I told you to stay
out of the maze.

958
01:07:23.408 --> 01:07:25.010
Dad.

959
01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:27.311
What?

960
01:07:27.345 --> 01:07:31.984
Henry, Bernard...

961
01:07:32.017 --> 01:07:33.852
Jack.

962
01:07:33.885 --> 01:07:36.222
All dead because of her.

963
01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:42.093
You know, I never
listen to myself.

964
01:07:42.126 --> 01:07:43.861
You know, people that have
gut instincts,

965
01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:45.997
they listen to their guts...
I never do that!

966
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:49.534
No, I listened to your mother,
and I listened to you.

967
01:07:49.568 --> 01:07:50.936
I did it!

968
01:07:50.968 --> 01:07:53.504
At what cost?

969
01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:56.240
Three of my boys?

970
01:07:56.274 --> 01:07:58.042
My wife?

971
01:07:58.075 --> 01:08:02.581
You think Jack cares
that you did it?

972
01:08:02.613 --> 01:08:06.284
Huh? Three sons, a wife... lost.

973
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:22.900
No, Jack.

974
01:08:22.934 --> 01:08:26.104
I'd give it all back
just to get it back.

975
01:08:26.136 --> 01:08:28.139
I'd give it all back
just to kiss your mama

976
01:08:28.172 --> 01:08:30.842
one more time, but I can't.

977
01:08:30.876 --> 01:08:33.212
I made sacrifices, too.

978
01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:37.216
Sacrifices!

979
01:08:40.185 --> 01:08:44.323
You call your mother
a sacrifice?!

980
01:08:44.355 --> 01:08:47.025
Jack, a sacrifice!?

981
01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:52.630
I know where the bodies
are buried.

982
01:08:52.663 --> 01:08:54.999
Do you?

983
01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:57.202
I go to bed every night
thinking...

984
01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:01.039
I'm gonna hear that,
and that's the sheriff

985
01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:02.940
with all the right questions.

986
01:09:02.974 --> 01:09:04.342
You go to bed that way?

987
01:09:04.376 --> 01:09:06.477
Huh?!

988
01:09:06.511 --> 01:09:12.084
And I will be damned
if I'm gonna walk my hallway

989
01:09:12.117 --> 01:09:14.352
knowing she's still alive!

990
01:09:19.056 --> 01:09:21.993
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

991
01:09:22.026 --> 01:09:23.895
If you wear a crown,

992
01:09:23.928 --> 01:09:27.565
it's because I put it there!

993
01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:51.088
Now clean it up.

994
01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:11.076
Don't ever disobey me again.

995
01:10:25.257 --> 01:10:28.561
Okay, here.
Let me give you a sample.

996
01:10:28.593 --> 01:10:33.031
Well, as you can see,
we are a well-oiled machine.

997
01:10:33.065 --> 01:10:35.301
Thousands of people
visit the maze weekly.

998
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.375
And that all help...

999
01:10:46.611 --> 01:10:49.716
That all helps streamline
production.

1000
01:10:49.749 --> 01:10:52.051
But our main goal is expansion.

1001
01:10:57.389 --> 01:11:00.325
Now, we have a small
year-to-year growth rate,

1002
01:11:00.359 --> 01:11:04.030
but in order to grow
exponentially,

1003
01:11:04.062 --> 01:11:07.266
we're gonna have to
increase volume tenfold.

1004
01:11:15.408 --> 01:11:19.611
Now, now, as much as I would
love to do that domestically,

1005
01:11:19.645 --> 01:11:22.482
that kind of increased volume
would bring a lot of, uh...

1006
01:11:24.115 --> 01:11:25.717
unneeded attention.

1007
01:11:32.557 --> 01:11:34.226
So all the numbers
I e-mailed you,

1008
01:11:34.259 --> 01:11:38.597
and as you can see,
business is booming!

1009
01:11:45.771 --> 01:11:47.373
Booming!

1010
01:11:47.405 --> 01:11:50.542
So, what do you say?
You wanna be part of the family?

1011
01:11:53.678 --> 01:11:55.547
Okay.

1012
01:14:18.423 --> 01:14:20.258
That's what
the love of money does.
