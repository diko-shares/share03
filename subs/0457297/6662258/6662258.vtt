1
00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.876
This spot is beautiful.

2
00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.147
Yeah, it really is.

3
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.054
You guys are lucky. I didn't have
a place like this where I grew up.

4
00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.559
What are you talking about?
You grew up like half an hour from here.

5
00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:03.256
Whatever. My parents
didn't let me out much.

6
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.924
Yeah, well, it was
really amazing for us.

7
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.867
In high school we used to sneak out
and come here all the time.

8
00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.927
That's right.
Late-night rendezvous. In fact,

9
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:15.067
we shared our first bottle
of tequila right here at this very spot.

10
00:01:15.143 --> 00:01:18.476
Wow. I am impressed
that you even remember that.

11
00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:20.981
"I am impressed that
you even remember that. "

12
00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.574
So do you guys feel like
you were the same as you were back then?

13
00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:25.643
Well, I know I'm
exactly the same.

14
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.587
I still have absolutely no idea what
I want to do when I grow up.

15
00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:31.422
Well, hey, you used to
work at Foot Locker, and I'm sure

16
00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:33.519
if you went back and asked,
they'd give you the job.

17
00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:35.757
- Very funny.
- What about you, Nick?

18
00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:38.130
- Have you changed much?
- Mmm-mm.

19
00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:42.829
Although I must say,
Trevor has gotten way hotter.

20
00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.738
You know that that is a fact,
my friend, okay?

21
00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:48.277
My jaw is way wider now.
It's striking.

22
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.141
All right, loverboy.
How about you and me

23
00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:53.376
go get some wood
for this fire, huh?

24
00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.417
All right,
take care.

25
00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.650
I got a really good feeling about
the next couple of months.

26
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:02.885
Yeah? Why is that?

27
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.555
If we just close a couple
of our own accounts,

28
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.791
you know how huge
that could be for us?

29
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.336
Yeah, I mean, retiring early
would be very nice.

30
00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.338
By 30?

31
00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:17.966
Oh, shit.
Look, look.

32
00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:19.168
Gross, dude.

33
00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:21.236
Come here. What, you
afraid of a little crab?

34
00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:22.837
Gross, dude!
Those things are just sick! Don't!

35
00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:25.406
- Come on. Come on.
- No, don't! Dude, don't! Don't!

36
00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:27.008
Fucking pussy.

37
00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:30.852
This is so exciting!

38
00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:33.391
Yeah. Maybe I should
wait till tomorrow.

39
00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.361
No, you have to
tell him tonight.

40
00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.363
Hey. Took you guys
long enough.

41
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.490
What are you
talking about?

42
00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:44.194
There it goes.
There it goes. Okay, ready?

43
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:46.831
Nice. Yeah, I'm ready.

44
00:02:46.907 --> 00:02:49.432
- Happy birthday!
- Oh!

45
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.001
- Oh, they went out. Relight.
- Wait wait.

46
00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.912
- All right.
- Okay, now make a wish.

47
00:02:54.982 --> 00:02:57.212
I can't.
Everything's perfect.

48
00:02:57.285 --> 00:02:58.684
- That's lame.
- Oh. Oh, sweetie.

49
00:02:58.753 --> 00:02:59.845
Whatever, dude.

50
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:01.616
If you need something,
I've got a whole list of things.

51
00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.748
- How about a million dollars?
- Blow 'em out, already.

52
00:03:03.824 --> 00:03:05.985
- Let's do this.
- All right, all right!

53
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.892
- Yay!
- No!

54
00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:10.693
- Come on. No. I bought 'em.
- It's my birthday cake.

55
00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:13.064
- I want it in the shot.
- In what shot?

56
00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:16.002
- Good idea, okay.
- Behave.

57
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.129
- Okay, everybody.
- Come on, hurry up, I want a cupcake.

58
00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:19.071
I know, just hold your horses
for a minute, all right?

59
00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:22.076
- Art. It's perfection.
- It's kinda ghetto frosting.

60
00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:23.805
- That's good though.
- That's my favorite.

61
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.211
Yup. Are you ready?

62
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:27.340
Yes.

63
00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:30.409
- Everybody say "chingas. "
- Chingas.

64
00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.489
- Good, guys.
- Chingas.

65
00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:37.856
Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:03:37.927 --> 00:03:39.758
I brought my own
special kind of birthday candle.

67
00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.923
- All right.
- Drugs!

68
00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.591
- You kids have fun.
- That is awesome.

69
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:46.568
- Light it up.
- Come here.

70
00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:49.773
- Hey, where are you going?
- Somewhere.

71
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.967
- Really?
- With you.

72
00:03:52.042 --> 00:03:54.340
- Okay.
- Camera, please.

73
00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:56.676
- Yes, sir.
- Put this on.

74
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.342
- All right.
- This is kind of exciting.

75
00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.515
- Oh, I will now be blindfolding you.
- Really?

76
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.458
- Are you going to take advantage of me?
- Mm, I might.

77
00:04:09.527 --> 00:04:12.827
- All right, hold this.
- Okay.

78
00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:15.560
- And...
- Oh!

79
00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:18.001
- We shall return.
- See you later.

80
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.300
Don't worry
about me.

81
00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:26.610
- Open.
- Oh.

82
00:04:28.547 --> 00:04:30.778
Remember the first time
we came here?

83
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:33.411
Yeah. What was that,
like three years ago?

84
00:04:33.487 --> 00:04:34.647
Yeah.

85
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:40.159
Nick, um,
there's something

86
00:04:40.227 --> 00:04:42.252
that I want to
tell you.

87
00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:44.297
Me first.

88
00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:47.434
Happy birthday.

89
00:04:47.502 --> 00:04:50.164
Nick! Oh!

90
00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:55.836
- It's beautiful.
- Wish it was a diamond, but...

91
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.777
Well, I love it.
I love you.

92
00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:04.880
Here, put it on.

93
00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:11.256
So, tell me again I'm not crazy and I
shouldn't go get my master's.

94
00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:13.727
Oh, no, you should.
You should go pay some

95
00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.287
art-school lifer
to grade your pictures.

96
00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:19.301
I don't have to pay them.
I can use my grant money.

97
00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:21.667
You get the point.

98
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:25.970
And more importantly, it's in New York,
which is 3,000 miles away from me.

99
00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:27.270
I know.

100
00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:29.904
My job is about to blow up.
I promise you.

101
00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.345
I'm gonna have the money so we can
open your own gallery.

102
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.146
You can shoot
your own pictures,

103
00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.052
just like we
talked about.

104
00:05:38.122 --> 00:05:41.285
- Isn't that what you want?
- Of course.

105
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:49.565
This is perfect.

106
00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:51.499
- Hey, don't get that, okay?
- Hey. Oh, where is it?

107
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.969
Remember, I wanted to
tell you something.

108
00:05:53.038 --> 00:05:55.598
I know.
Just give me one second.

109
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.245
It's work.
Hold on.

110
00:06:01.313 --> 00:06:03.679
Hello?

111
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:06.218
Yeah.

112
00:06:06.285 --> 00:06:08.253
Oh, okay.

113
00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.349
Right. No no no, it's not...
it's not a problem.

114
00:06:14.694 --> 00:06:16.787
All right.
Bye-bye.

115
00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:21.826
It was Bristol.
I have to go to work.

116
00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:24.803
Yeah, and it's my birthday,
so call him back,

117
00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:26.533
tell him you're sick.
You just can't go.

118
00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:30.202
Listen.
If you do this for me,

119
00:06:30.277 --> 00:06:32.336
we will come back
here next year,

120
00:06:32.413 --> 00:06:34.404
and we will stay
the whole weekend,

121
00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:36.813
and we'll get
a hotel room, and...

122
00:06:38.653 --> 00:06:40.621
Baby?

123
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.318
Help me out here. I really need to go
to this meeting.

124
00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:49.430
No, forget it.

125
00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.736
I want a week.

126
00:06:56.906 --> 00:06:59.238
- A week?
- That's right.

127
00:06:59.308 --> 00:07:02.709
You and me
and no cell phones.

128
00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:06.843
You can personally

129
00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.510
smash this thing
before we leave.

130
00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:11.645
How's that?

131
00:07:13.323 --> 00:07:15.291
Okay.

132
00:07:16.593 --> 00:07:18.857
Actually, you know what?
Why wait? I say...

133
00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:20.897
we just drown this thing now
to make sure.

134
00:07:20.964 --> 00:07:23.626
Oh! Oh! Oh, that's...
I don't think so.

135
00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:29.604
Give us something
to talk about

136
00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:33.110
Take your time...

137
00:07:39.183 --> 00:07:42.482
Aw, shit. Baby, did you remember
my sunglasses?

138
00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:44.545
Mm? What would you
do without me?

139
00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:50.551
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

140
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:52.995
Yeah, a dick who's gonna
get promoted instead of me

141
00:07:53.065 --> 00:07:54.089
if I flake on this meeting.

142
00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:57.693
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays then?
- And Julie's birthday.

143
00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.739
If I want to beat 'em,
I have to join 'em.

144
00:08:00.807 --> 00:08:03.037
- Right now!
- Don't.

145
00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:06.567
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
just should blow the whole thing off.

146
00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:09.638
Yeah, you know, you're right.
I don't need this job anyway.

147
00:08:09.716 --> 00:08:12.514
Great idea. And when you get fired
I'm sure Trevor will last

148
00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:15.053
about two weeks
at work without you.

149
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:17.113
Why do you
have to say that?

150
00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:19.989
Wait, guys.
Hold up, hold up.

151
00:08:22.663 --> 00:08:25.632
Okay.
Nice.

152
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:29.392
You know what, baby?
You can move to New York with me,

153
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.233
and we could be
starving artists together.

154
00:08:31.305 --> 00:08:32.739
Wouldn't that be perfect, hon?

155
00:08:32.807 --> 00:08:34.536
Sounds like you
have it all worked out.

156
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.905
Shit!
Hold on!

157
00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:42.208
Oh God!

158
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.784
- Is everyone all right?
- You okay? You okay?

159
00:08:47.856 --> 00:08:49.791
- I think so.
- Are you sure?

160
00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:52.350
- Oh! Oh God!
- Oh, shit!

161
00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:56.527
Nick, move! Ah!

162
00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:10.843
Nick.

163
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:13.175
Oh, Nick.

164
00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:15.181
Shh.

165
00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:18.781
Shh. Shh.

166
00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:20.946
Nick, it's okay.

167
00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:29.021
Room 9, we've got a code blue.
He's gone into attack.

168
00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:33.227
190 and rising.

169
00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:39.738
Shh, Nick.
Shh.

170
00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:41.800
Nick...

171
00:10:45.048 --> 00:10:47.642
It's okay.

172
00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:56.018
He gets nightmares
sometimes.

173
00:10:57.126 --> 00:10:59.425
He always has.

174
00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:33.627
Nick.

175
00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:35.667
Oh, Nick!

176
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.341
Where's Julie?

177
00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:55.183
Honey, she's...

178
00:11:57.224 --> 00:12:00.022
- Where are they?
- They didn't...

179
00:12:00.093 --> 00:12:02.323
- No. No.
- Nick...

180
00:12:18.513 --> 00:12:19.845
Okay, everybody.

181
00:12:19.915 --> 00:12:21.849
- Just hold your horses for a minute.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

182
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.725
- Yay! Come on!
- No!

183
00:12:43.072 --> 00:12:46.508
You know what? I cannot imagine
my life without you now.

184
00:13:03.027 --> 00:13:05.393
You know, I was thinking...
if you, um...

185
00:13:05.462 --> 00:13:08.626
if you really need a change
of scenery or whatever,

186
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.567
I've got some extra
room at my place.

187
00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:14.036
For what?

188
00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:16.596
You.

189
00:13:16.675 --> 00:13:19.701
I want you
to live with me.

190
00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:12.627
Nick, it's Mom.

191
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:15.499
How you feeling?
I spoke to the doctor.

192
00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:18.369
He said you canceled
your appointment again.

193
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.034
Nick, you've got to
take care of yourself.

194
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.136
You don't want the headaches
to get any worse.

195
00:14:24.213 --> 00:14:27.148
Please, call me.

196
00:15:18.805 --> 00:15:20.739
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

197
00:15:20.807 --> 00:15:23.435
- Thought you were out sick.
- No.

198
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:27.240
Bristol's looking for you.
Just a heads up.

199
00:15:27.313 --> 00:15:29.281
Thanks, man.

200
00:15:30.883 --> 00:15:33.819
- You don't pick up your phone?
- Oh, I was in the copy room.

201
00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:35.047
I need those spreadsheets.

202
00:15:35.122 --> 00:15:37.283
Yeah, I put 'em on your desk
last night.

203
00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:39.826
I was here until 7:00.

204
00:15:39.893 --> 00:15:42.157
After that.
Did you check your inbox?

205
00:15:42.229 --> 00:15:44.925
Look, I'm telling you
I can't find 'em, so just...

206
00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:47.524
print me up a new report,
spare me the boring fairy tale.

207
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:49.570
We've got the Rosemont
Equities meeting, one hour.

208
00:15:49.637 --> 00:15:51.798
Wait. What are you
talking about?

209
00:15:52.974 --> 00:15:54.908
11:00,
sales presentation...

210
00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:57.501
- I thought that was at 4:00.
- I had to move it, okay?

211
00:15:57.579 --> 00:15:59.706
And you're just
telling me this now?

212
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:02.045
Look, Nick,

213
00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:05.713
80% of all start-ups fail in the first
two years. It is an uphill battle.

214
00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:09.189
Everyone's got to pull
their own weight. No exceptions.

215
00:16:09.258 --> 00:16:13.194
Okay. No problem.
I'll have the spreadsheets.

216
00:16:13.262 --> 00:16:15.890
I can give the pitch myself if you think
you can't handle it.

217
00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:17.660
I said no problem.

218
00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:21.164
Okay.

219
00:16:21.237 --> 00:16:23.206
You keep
your shit together.

220
00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:25.741
Okay? I can't have you pop another
brain fart and fuck this thing up.

221
00:16:27.177 --> 00:16:29.645
Clean up your desk.
It's a mess.

222
00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:34.212
What we're talking about is software
that will enable your handheld

223
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:37.412
to communicate with
any wireless technology.

224
00:16:37.487 --> 00:16:41.925
Imagine being able to access
all of your technology from here.

225
00:16:41.993 --> 00:16:44.860
Picture it. Say you're in a cab
on your way to a meeting.

226
00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:48.456
You're checking your e-mails,
you're surfing the web, a call comes in.

227
00:16:48.533 --> 00:16:52.094
Well, your new client decides
that they need additional product images

228
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.538
to be included in the presentation
that you're giving in an hour.

229
00:16:55.607 --> 00:16:58.007
You rush over
to the job site

230
00:16:58.077 --> 00:17:01.604
snap a couple of jpegs,
get to your meeting.

231
00:17:02.714 --> 00:17:05.342
And gentlemen,
what you've got

232
00:17:06.452 --> 00:17:09.478
is a slideshow
in your pocket.

233
00:17:17.363 --> 00:17:20.196
Okay, so...

234
00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:23.201
everyone's developing
next-gen software for handhelds,

235
00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:26.204
including the big guys.

236
00:17:26.273 --> 00:17:28.764
Why put money into yours?

237
00:17:28.843 --> 00:17:30.777
Because ours
is ready now.

238
00:17:30.845 --> 00:17:32.904
We, with our partners
at Strike Line, believe

239
00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.505
we can have this on the market
within the quarter.

240
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.198
- Nick.
- Is he having a seizure or what?

241
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:59.708
No, he gets headaches.
Nick! Nick!

242
00:18:11.654 --> 00:18:13.679
I'm so sorry.

243
00:18:16.527 --> 00:18:18.586
I swear, if I get
one more S. E. C. notice,

244
00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:22.063
I'm gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

245
00:18:22.132 --> 00:18:25.158
Yeah, the weather's
nice there.

246
00:18:25.235 --> 00:18:27.726
I'm... sorry about
the meeting, sir.

247
00:18:27.804 --> 00:18:31.036
Nick, I shouldn't
have to tell you...

248
00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:34.135
80% of all start-ups fail
within the first two years.

249
00:18:34.212 --> 00:18:36.339
We make one mistake,
it affects everything.

250
00:18:36.414 --> 00:18:38.075
We can't go back
and do this over again.

251
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:40.845
You're absolutely
right.

252
00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:44.184
I assure you this will
not happen again.

253
00:18:44.255 --> 00:18:47.384
Dave tells me you've been
having some problems lately

254
00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.393
with concentrating
and remembering stuff.

255
00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.986
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

256
00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.191
Really, it's...
it's not a big deal.

257
00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:55.790
I want you to just go home,

258
00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:58.393
take the rest of the week off
and recharge the batteries.

259
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.268
- Mr. Callahan, really, I can work.
- Nick...

260
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.468
I need to work.

261
00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:06.979
It's done.
Just go home.

262
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.113
We'll see you in a week.

263
00:19:24.098 --> 00:19:26.931
Always searching

264
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:31.665
Looking for the one
to wrap your soul

265
00:19:31.739 --> 00:19:33.764
Around

266
00:19:36.144 --> 00:19:40.581
Sing the one name
as you let go

267
00:19:40.649 --> 00:19:43.277
The fear of flying

268
00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:46.287
You're on your way

269
00:19:46.355 --> 00:19:49.984
Endless love

270
00:20:00.203 --> 00:20:02.228
And you say

271
00:20:07.143 --> 00:20:10.511
You're gonna turn
time around...

272
00:20:18.422 --> 00:20:20.583
Oh, man.

273
00:20:50.189 --> 00:20:52.953
Oh, shit. Baby, did you
grab my sunglasses?

274
00:20:53.025 --> 00:20:56.085
Mm? What would you
do without me?

275
00:21:01.034 --> 00:21:03.002
Hmm?

276
00:21:08.108 --> 00:21:11.271
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

277
00:21:11.345 --> 00:21:13.280
Yeah, a dick
who'll get promoted

278
00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:16.112
instead of me if I flake
on this meeting.

279
00:21:16.184 --> 00:21:19.676
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays?
- And Julie's birthday.

280
00:21:21.889 --> 00:21:24.289
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
should just blow the whole thing off.

281
00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:28.295
You're right.
I don't really need this job anyway.

282
00:21:29.498 --> 00:21:31.432
Yeah.
Great idea.

283
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.400
I'm sure when you get fired,
Trevor will last

284
00:21:33.469 --> 00:21:35.562
- two weeks at work without you, maybe.
- "Two weeks at work without you. "

285
00:21:35.637 --> 00:21:38.936
- Why you got to say that?
- What?

286
00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:41.567
Ooh, guys, wait.
I want to get a picture of this.

287
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.644
Nice. And you
know what, honey?

288
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.655
You can move to New York with me
and we can be starving artists together.

289
00:21:53.723 --> 00:21:56.157
- Isn't that a perfect idea?
- Put your seat belt on.

290
00:21:56.226 --> 00:21:58.660
- What?
- Put it on!

291
00:22:00.363 --> 00:22:02.594
Okay. Shit.

292
00:22:21.353 --> 00:22:23.787
I think so.

293
00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:58.179
Hey, pumpkin. Hey, do you know
what you're gonna wear?

294
00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:10.761
What's happening?

295
00:24:10.835 --> 00:24:12.804
Are you okay?

296
00:24:18.443 --> 00:24:20.411
Nick?

297
00:24:39.165 --> 00:24:41.099
Oh, Nick,
are you okay?

298
00:24:41.167 --> 00:24:44.069
What's wrong, huh?
Huh?

299
00:24:47.107 --> 00:24:49.905
What's the matter?

300
00:24:49.977 --> 00:24:51.968
I think I was
having a nightmare.

301
00:24:52.046 --> 00:24:54.037
Oh, baby!
It's okay.

302
00:24:54.114 --> 00:24:56.605
All right?
It's all over now. It's all over.

303
00:24:58.452 --> 00:25:00.751
Oh, shh.

304
00:25:06.928 --> 00:25:09.419
Oh, God!

305
00:25:10.832 --> 00:25:13.198
Okay?
Now let's get going.

306
00:25:13.268 --> 00:25:15.429
We'll celebrate my birthday.
It'll be fun.

307
00:25:15.503 --> 00:25:19.406
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go get ready. All right.

308
00:25:20.443 --> 00:25:23.003
Okay.

309
00:25:31.287 --> 00:25:34.587
I know how weird it sounds.
It's just...

310
00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:36.990
I can't explain it.
I...

311
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.120
there's this entire
other version

312
00:25:40.197 --> 00:25:42.188
of my life
without you.

313
00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:45.860
I went through
a whole year

314
00:25:45.936 --> 00:25:48.667
believing you were dead.

315
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.699
And then I just...
I just wake up, and there you are.

316
00:25:52.777 --> 00:25:56.235
Okay, it was just
a bad dream, all right?

317
00:25:56.314 --> 00:25:58.043
It wasn't real.

318
00:25:58.116 --> 00:26:01.085
I'm here.
Come on.

319
00:26:03.788 --> 00:26:05.984
I hear you, I do,

320
00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:09.721
but it's just I'm having
a really difficult time believing it.

321
00:26:09.795 --> 00:26:12.229
It's been
a traumatic year

322
00:26:12.297 --> 00:26:14.595
for both of us, okay?

323
00:26:14.667 --> 00:26:18.296
- But we made it.
- It's not that.

324
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.201
Hey.

325
00:26:22.342 --> 00:26:24.537
I am here.

326
00:26:26.913 --> 00:26:29.279
And that's all
that matters.

327
00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:35.986
All right.

328
00:26:36.056 --> 00:26:38.787
- You're right.
- I know.

329
00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:42.192
Oh, fuck.
You're right.

330
00:26:42.263 --> 00:26:44.993
Hi.
Sorry we're late.

331
00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:47.000
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

332
00:26:47.068 --> 00:26:49.730
- Happy 25th, old lady.
- Oh!

333
00:26:49.804 --> 00:26:52.739
How's it going, man?

334
00:26:52.807 --> 00:26:54.742
Good.

335
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.677
It is really
frickin' good!

336
00:26:57.746 --> 00:27:00.647
Oh, it's good to
see you, man!

337
00:27:00.716 --> 00:27:02.547
Yeah, it's good.
Good.

338
00:27:04.586 --> 00:27:08.113
You two,
you look amazing!

339
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.182
Oh, how much has
he had to drink?

340
00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:13.285
Well, it's been
a long night.

341
00:27:13.362 --> 00:27:16.388
Speaking of which,
why don't, uh...

342
00:27:16.466 --> 00:27:18.696
- Yes, let's.
... you and I do the...

343
00:27:18.768 --> 00:27:20.702
- Right.
- Okay.

344
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.137
... and you two...
good. All right.

345
00:27:24.207 --> 00:27:26.574
Hey, how's it goin', man?
Two MGDs,

346
00:27:26.643 --> 00:27:29.237
Jack on the rocks
and a house red, please.

347
00:27:29.313 --> 00:27:31.804
Please tell me that you
locked down the strippers.

348
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.184
The strippers?

349
00:27:35.252 --> 00:27:38.016
For my bachelor party.

350
00:27:38.088 --> 00:27:40.682
Your bachelor party?

351
00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:46.055
Because... you two
are getting married,

352
00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:48.691
and I'm...
the best man.

353
00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:51.759
Which means I would have
locked down the strippers.

354
00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:54.634
Of course I did,
dumb-ass!

355
00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.640
- You're scaring me, man.
- Dude, I got the...

356
00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:59.473
10 hottest
strippers ever.

357
00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:03.046
10?

358
00:28:03.115 --> 00:28:05.845
Awesome! Thanks.
Thank you.

359
00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:07.909
I am...

360
00:28:09.555 --> 00:28:12.752
I am so psyched
for you guys!

361
00:28:12.825 --> 00:28:14.817
Oh. Okay.

362
00:29:03.112 --> 00:29:05.945
Do you still think
you're dreaming?

363
00:29:06.015 --> 00:29:10.145
Baby, what's wrong?
Baby, what's wrong?

364
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.711
Nothing.

365
00:29:45.323 --> 00:29:47.917
- I love you.
- I love you.

366
00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:56.824
- Oh god.
- All right, baby.

367
00:30:46.522 --> 00:30:49.286
"Migraines have been linked
to seizures in recent studies.

368
00:30:49.358 --> 00:30:51.622
Patients with a high frequency
of migraine attacks

369
00:30:51.694 --> 00:30:54.356
are at greater risk
for cerebral strokes.

370
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.729
This progressive brain disease
can lead to

371
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.600
acute and selected
memory loss.

372
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.264

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.571
delusions, hallucinations, hearing
things that are not actually present... "

374
00:31:12.216 --> 00:31:15.913
"Schizophrenia refers to
a split between emotion and thought. "

375
00:31:33.105 --> 00:31:36.632
"Studies have shown the disease
to be genetically linked,

376
00:31:36.708 --> 00:31:39.905
which in its end stages
can result in suicide. "

377
00:32:04.171 --> 00:32:06.969
Hey!
How ya feelin'?

378
00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:09.839
Oh, busted.
Looking at porn. Again.

379
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.207
- Yeah.
- By the way,

380
00:32:11.278 --> 00:32:12.905
you were really
fucked up last night, man.

381
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.107
Yeah, I had
a couple of drinks.

382
00:32:15.182 --> 00:32:17.549
- Yeah, a couple.
- Um...

383
00:32:19.921 --> 00:32:22.822
What?

384
00:32:22.891 --> 00:32:26.156
Hey, guys. Bristol just called
a staff meeting.

385
00:32:26.227 --> 00:32:27.888
Conference room, five minutes.

386
00:32:27.962 --> 00:32:29.589
Oh, God. What does
that prick want now?

387
00:32:29.664 --> 00:32:32.497
I don't know, but he wants to see you
in his office beforehand.

388
00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:36.129
What?
Oh. Oh, guys?

389
00:32:36.205 --> 00:32:39.197
I think I can already
feel his foot up my ass.

390
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:43.103
All right, people,
let's get right to it.

391
00:32:45.214 --> 00:32:46.738
You've all heard me warn you
about the problems

392
00:32:46.816 --> 00:32:48.909
of the average start-up company.

393
00:32:48.984 --> 00:32:52.352
Well, it seems that we've been on
the losing end this week.

394
00:32:52.422 --> 00:32:54.686
I had five deals
fall through,

395
00:32:54.758 --> 00:32:57.249
including R. S. B.
Financial.

396
00:32:57.327 --> 00:32:59.318
That's...

397
00:32:59.396 --> 00:33:02.024
That's Trevor's account.
He said it was a sure thing.

398
00:33:02.099 --> 00:33:04.124
Well,
he was wrong.

399
00:33:04.201 --> 00:33:06.033
And unfortunately,
Mr. Callahan felt

400
00:33:06.104 --> 00:33:08.368
like he had to send
a message on this one.

401
00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:10.532
We've had to let
Trevor go.

402
00:33:13.578 --> 00:33:15.910
So I suggest that we all
get back to work, hmm?

403
00:33:17.715 --> 00:33:20.741
Doesn't that seem
a little harsh?

404
00:33:24.323 --> 00:33:26.314
Yes.

405
00:33:26.391 --> 00:33:28.985
- So what actually happened?
- Excuse me?

406
00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:31.256
Well, if Trevor thought

407
00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.662
it was a sure thing,
why'd the deal fall apart?

408
00:33:36.368 --> 00:33:38.564
Come on, Bristol.

409
00:33:38.638 --> 00:33:41.004
You had Trevor's job once,

410
00:33:41.074 --> 00:33:43.269
and you know
how hard it is.

411
00:33:43.343 --> 00:33:46.176
Yeah, and I worked my ass off,
I didn't make mistakes

412
00:33:46.246 --> 00:33:48.407
and I got rewarded.

413
00:33:48.481 --> 00:33:50.813
Why? 'Cause
the Strike Line deal

414
00:33:50.884 --> 00:33:53.284
fell on your lap?

415
00:33:53.353 --> 00:33:56.915
You were supposed to close
the R. S. B. deal, not Trevor.

416
00:33:58.392 --> 00:34:00.792
And you think you know
something we don't?

417
00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:03.591
What I know

418
00:34:03.664 --> 00:34:05.996
is Mr. Callahan pays me
to be the judge of you people,

419
00:34:06.066 --> 00:34:08.330
and right now my judgment is telling me
that you'd much rather be

420
00:34:08.402 --> 00:34:10.530
at home watching "Oprah"
with your friend

421
00:34:10.605 --> 00:34:12.436
than working
on this team any longer.

422
00:34:12.507 --> 00:34:14.634
Congratulations, Nick.
You're fired too.

423
00:34:15.744 --> 00:34:17.735
Anyone else?

424
00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:27.253
I love you, man,
but this was not your problem.

425
00:34:27.323 --> 00:34:29.518
Fuck that.

426
00:34:29.592 --> 00:34:32.459
If it wasn't for us, Bristol wouldn't
have been promoted in the first place.

427
00:34:32.528 --> 00:34:34.553
I'm not taking
orders from him.

428
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.063
Nick, you worked your ass
off at this place.

429
00:34:36.132 --> 00:34:37.599
You put your blood
into this place, man.

430
00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:40.135
Yeah, I put my blood into this place,
and Bristol's the one who gets promoted.

431
00:34:40.203 --> 00:34:43.264
Nick, that's business.
You taught me that.

432
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.400
Now, look.
Go tell Bristol you're sorry.

433
00:34:46.476 --> 00:34:48.876
Tell him you're still having
side effects from the accident.

434
00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:55.849
Only side effect I'm having is knowing
life is way too short for this.

435
00:34:58.589 --> 00:35:00.524
What is this,
a guy thing?

436
00:35:00.592 --> 00:35:02.890
Trevor gets canned, so you just jump off
the bridge with him?

437
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:05.794
Look, I was never gonna move up with
Bristol as my supervisor anyway.

438
00:35:05.863 --> 00:35:07.592
Ever since the guy got promoted,

439
00:35:07.665 --> 00:35:09.792
he's just been looking
for an excuse to fire me.

440
00:35:09.867 --> 00:35:12.461
- Well, you didn't have to give him one.
- You know what? The truth is,

441
00:35:12.537 --> 00:35:14.630
he's the weak link.
He's ruined the whole company,

442
00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:16.766
and everybody knows it.
And you know what?

443
00:35:16.842 --> 00:35:19.310
I am better off
just getting out from under him.

444
00:35:19.378 --> 00:35:21.744
No, Nick.
You're better off with a job.

445
00:35:21.814 --> 00:35:23.839
I told you,
I'll find another one.

446
00:35:23.916 --> 00:35:26.646
A better one.
We'll all be okay.

447
00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:30.985
You also told me to stay here and not go
to New York, because that would be okay.

448
00:35:31.056 --> 00:35:32.991
I'm sorry,

449
00:35:33.059 --> 00:35:36.358
and I just can't
forget what we lost in that accident.

450
00:35:48.242 --> 00:35:50.210
Hon?

451
00:35:54.081 --> 00:35:56.049
Hey.

452
00:35:57.285 --> 00:36:00.584
Hey, it will be.

453
00:36:00.655 --> 00:36:02.850
It just takes time.

454
00:36:02.923 --> 00:36:05.859
Nick, it's been a year.

455
00:36:05.927 --> 00:36:10.193
I spend my days cataloguing other
people's photo shoots for minimum wage.

456
00:36:10.265 --> 00:36:13.666
I have half a portfolio
and no time to finish it, and now...

457
00:36:13.735 --> 00:36:16.465
Well, now I have to get
another job so that we can pay our rent.

458
00:36:16.538 --> 00:36:18.506
Excuse me.

459
00:36:25.048 --> 00:36:27.846
Hey. Hey.

460
00:36:27.917 --> 00:36:30.477
Hey.

461
00:36:30.553 --> 00:36:33.818
It's about the big picture.
I finally see it now.

462
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.520
All that other stuff
is just... just stuff.

463
00:36:37.594 --> 00:36:39.892
Look, the only thing
that is important

464
00:36:39.963 --> 00:36:42.955
is that we have
each other.

465
00:36:43.033 --> 00:36:45.593
That's all that counts.

466
00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:51.103
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

467
00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:06.579
Mm. Maybe I'll be
a technical copyeditor.

468
00:37:16.402 --> 00:37:20.566
Is that Bristol?
Jerk.

469
00:37:43.664 --> 00:37:46.030
Come on.

470
00:37:52.607 --> 00:37:54.575
Nick?

471
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.979
Nick.

472
00:38:05.888 --> 00:38:08.083
- Perfect shot.
- Ah! Great.

473
00:38:08.157 --> 00:38:09.715
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

474
00:38:09.792 --> 00:38:11.419
- Isn't that great?
- You look so good.

475
00:38:11.493 --> 00:38:15.089
Nice.
So, what do you think?

476
00:38:15.165 --> 00:38:17.463
- Hmm?
- The ring, honey. Isn't it beautiful?

477
00:38:17.534 --> 00:38:20.162
Can you believe
I picked that thing out myself?

478
00:38:20.236 --> 00:38:22.329
- It's fantastic.
- Ooh.

479
00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:24.464
Yeah.
Sure, it's beautiful.

480
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:27.032
We're thinking
next October.

481
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.875
Oh, how many people
are you gonna invite?

482
00:38:29.947 --> 00:38:33.508
You know, maybe 50.
Just the important ones.

483
00:38:33.584 --> 00:38:35.347
- Mmm.
- Ah. Right.

484
00:38:35.419 --> 00:38:38.252
- Dave Bristol.
- What?

485
00:38:38.322 --> 00:38:40.313
From your office?

486
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:44.054
Yeah, right. Like I'd
invite that tool.

487
00:38:44.128 --> 00:38:47.360
Looks like I'm out.
Anyone else need more?

488
00:38:47.432 --> 00:38:49.593
Oh, no, honey.

489
00:38:53.672 --> 00:38:55.936
Bristol,
merry Christmas.

490
00:38:56.007 --> 00:38:58.305
Merry Christmas.

491
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.820
Oh, come on, Nick!

492
00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:15.725
- What are you doing?
- Bristol, I'm sorry, man.

493
00:39:15.795 --> 00:39:18.162
What a klutz.
Can I...

494
00:39:18.232 --> 00:39:20.666
Nice.
That's really nice.

495
00:39:20.734 --> 00:39:22.326
Oh, man.

496
00:39:22.402 --> 00:39:24.029
Oh, that's embarrassing,

497
00:39:24.104 --> 00:39:25.503
so embarrassing.

498
00:40:58.771 --> 00:41:00.739
No way.

499
00:42:21.926 --> 00:42:24.087
Hey, Nick.

500
00:42:24.162 --> 00:42:26.153
I know you need
those spreadsheets.

501
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.425
I'm just waiting on some numbers
from the clients.

502
00:42:31.969 --> 00:42:34.370
Holy shit.

503
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.965
I'm the vice president.

504
00:42:37.042 --> 00:42:40.876
Uh, yeah, of course.
I'm not trying to make excuses.

505
00:42:40.946 --> 00:42:43.278
I pulled the Strike Line
deal, not you.

506
00:42:43.348 --> 00:42:45.908
I'm sorry.
I'm just not following this.

507
00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:49.287
Where's Trevor?

508
00:42:49.355 --> 00:42:53.291
At some off-site client meeting.
He said you knew about it.

509
00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:56.886
Oh, yeah, right.
Thanks.

510
00:42:56.963 --> 00:43:01.263
Oh, and Bristol, clean up that desk.
It's a mess.

511
00:43:08.709 --> 00:43:10.768
I swear, if I get
one more S. E. C. notice,

512
00:43:10.845 --> 00:43:14.747
I am gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

513
00:43:14.815 --> 00:43:16.749
Well, I hear
the weather's nice there.

514
00:43:16.817 --> 00:43:20.548
Yeah, I guess.
So how you feelin'?

515
00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:24.080
Oh, better than ever.

516
00:43:24.159 --> 00:43:26.423
Listen, I'm having dinner
with a potential investor.

517
00:43:26.495 --> 00:43:28.486
He's a big one.
We need him.

518
00:43:28.563 --> 00:43:30.531
You know what they say
about start-ups.

519
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.634
I want you riding shotgun.

520
00:43:33.702 --> 00:43:36.296
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, Mr. Callahan.

521
00:43:36.371 --> 00:43:39.535
"Mr. Callahan. "
That's cute.

522
00:44:17.081 --> 00:44:20.107
The weather burns in you

523
00:44:20.185 --> 00:44:23.416
I can't predict the rain

524
00:44:25.723 --> 00:44:27.715
The silence falls...

525
00:44:27.793 --> 00:44:29.886
"Pacific Avenue. "

526
00:44:29.962 --> 00:44:32.658
You've reached Julie Miller
Photography.

527
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:34.961
I can't take your call,
so please leave a message,

528
00:44:35.034 --> 00:44:37.867
including your phone number
and the date you'd like to book.

529
00:44:37.937 --> 00:44:39.871
Thank you.

530
00:44:39.939 --> 00:44:42.909
Well, hello there,
Julie Miller Photography.

531
00:44:42.976 --> 00:44:45.274
It's Nick Larson calling,

532
00:44:45.345 --> 00:44:49.304
and the date I would like to book is for
tonight after my client meeting,

533
00:44:49.382 --> 00:44:51.441
which hopefully won't
last too long.

534
00:44:51.518 --> 00:44:53.315
So why don't you
give me a call back

535
00:44:53.386 --> 00:44:55.650
and let me know if that works
for your schedule?

536
00:44:55.722 --> 00:44:59.215
Unless of course I see you at home
first. All right. I love you, babe.

537
00:45:07.602 --> 00:45:09.570
Honey, I'm home!

538
00:45:14.242 --> 00:45:16.177
No.

539
00:45:25.821 --> 00:45:27.789
What?

540
00:45:42.338 --> 00:45:45.034
Hey, Nick, it's Mom.
I hope you're okay.

541
00:45:45.108 --> 00:45:47.339
I'd say so.

542
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:50.471
Call me. I haven't seen you for weeks.
I know you're busy,

543
00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:53.175
but let me know
how you are.

544
00:46:09.234 --> 00:46:12.431
A toast... to
successful partnerships.

545
00:46:12.504 --> 00:46:14.438
- Salud.
- Salud.

546
00:46:14.506 --> 00:46:17.532
Your daughter is
charming and beautiful.

547
00:46:18.977 --> 00:46:21.446
Thank you.

548
00:46:21.514 --> 00:46:24.608
Mm. And what
about you, Nick?

549
00:46:24.684 --> 00:46:27.050
Do you have
family here?

550
00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:29.280
Uh, just my mom.
Yeah.

551
00:46:29.355 --> 00:46:32.381
My, uh... my father moved away
when I was a kid.

552
00:46:32.458 --> 00:46:34.824
Ah. I am very sorry
to hear that.

553
00:46:36.596 --> 00:46:38.723
Well, it seems that
you turned out all right.

554
00:46:38.799 --> 00:46:41.324
You have certainly made
an impression on your boss.

555
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:42.925
Oh, well...

556
00:46:43.003 --> 00:46:45.164
Nick's had a bit of
a magic touch lately.

557
00:46:45.238 --> 00:46:49.004
Well, I just try to keep
things simple, you know?

558
00:46:49.076 --> 00:46:51.545
Know what you want
and try to make that happen.

559
00:46:51.612 --> 00:46:54.137
And if that doesn't work out,
you steal the file

560
00:46:54.215 --> 00:46:56.513
from the guy sitting next to you
and hope that one's a winner.

561
00:46:58.152 --> 00:47:01.713
All right, Nick.
Well, let's get serious for a minute

562
00:47:01.789 --> 00:47:05.486
and tell Mr. Fuentes
about the new numbers.

563
00:47:07.228 --> 00:47:10.198
Now? Oh, we're having
such a good time.

564
00:47:10.265 --> 00:47:12.859
The new numbers,
Nick.

565
00:47:12.935 --> 00:47:16.200
We're about to ask
Mr. Fuentes for a large amount of money.

566
00:47:16.271 --> 00:47:18.796
You have to dazzle
the wallet out of his pocket

567
00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:21.536
and make it dance
on the table.

568
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.012
No, really, Ron, you take the glory.
This is your baby.

569
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:28.544
The numbers, Nick.

570
00:47:31.287 --> 00:47:34.450
Well, what we're, uh...
we're really talking about

571
00:47:34.524 --> 00:47:36.958
is, uh...

572
00:47:40.664 --> 00:47:43.758
the next generation of
hand-held operating systems.

573
00:47:47.271 --> 00:47:50.206
Our software capitalizes
on optical internet protocol,

574
00:47:50.274 --> 00:47:52.799
using light-wave
architectures for processing

575
00:47:52.877 --> 00:47:55.778
so that it will send and receive data
over multiple wavelengths.

576
00:47:55.846 --> 00:47:58.008
Our system can be commercialized
within six months,

577
00:47:58.083 --> 00:48:00.643
and with a working beta product
and your company's backing,

578
00:48:00.719 --> 00:48:04.246
we can expect to sign one,
maybe two of the incumbents.

579
00:48:04.322 --> 00:48:06.654
Then we'll minimize
our front-end expenditures

580
00:48:06.725 --> 00:48:08.659
by outsourcing to
a flex manufacturer in China.

581
00:48:08.727 --> 00:48:10.888
If we're right,
our product margins will add

582
00:48:10.962 --> 00:48:14.558
500 basis points to your company's
gross margins within 12 months.

583
00:48:14.634 --> 00:48:18.400
Bottom line, if we achieve one-third
of the unit sales forecasted,

584
00:48:18.471 --> 00:48:20.439
we'll double your
company's cash flow.

585
00:48:39.693 --> 00:48:41.661
All right.

586
00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:47.465
Hey.
How's it going?

587
00:48:47.535 --> 00:48:49.901
I'm about to pull out
my hair, I'm so bored.

588
00:48:51.272 --> 00:48:54.264
Yeah, it's, uh...

589
00:48:54.342 --> 00:48:56.674
sorry for all
the technobabble.

590
00:48:56.744 --> 00:49:00.510
Actually, you know,
that's the part that got me hot.

591
00:49:00.582 --> 00:49:01.743
Grace?

592
00:49:02.852 --> 00:49:04.285
Oh Jesus.

593
00:49:04.353 --> 00:49:06.446
What are you doing?

594
00:49:06.522 --> 00:49:08.649
Baby, it's been
a week.

595
00:49:08.724 --> 00:49:10.885
What, you want me
to beg for it?

596
00:49:13.162 --> 00:49:16.825
Whoa. Hey. Hey hey hey.
We're in a restaurant.

597
00:49:18.001 --> 00:49:20.697
When has that ever
stopped you before?

598
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.344
Oh fuck.

599
00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:34.384
Hold up.
Your dad's right outside.

600
00:49:34.452 --> 00:49:36.386
I don't care about that,
and neither does he.

601
00:49:36.454 --> 00:49:39.218
Besides, I'll just tell him
to give you another raise.

602
00:49:43.928 --> 00:49:45.896
Oh, Nick!

603
00:49:55.474 --> 00:49:58.409
- I want you, Nick.
- I hear you.

604
00:50:08.354 --> 00:50:08.581
Yeah.

605
00:50:30.611 --> 00:50:32.772
Yeah!

606
00:50:52.234 --> 00:50:54.099
Oh my God.
What are you doing?

607
00:50:54.169 --> 00:50:56.434
Let's have some fun here.

608
00:50:56.505 --> 00:50:59.201
Smile, baby.

609
00:50:59.275 --> 00:51:01.743
Uh-uh. Hey...

610
00:51:01.811 --> 00:51:04.245
- I'll be in touch.
- You're most welcome.

611
00:51:06.916 --> 00:51:09.851
You did great, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

612
00:51:09.919 --> 00:51:12.411
Yeah, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

613
00:51:20.998 --> 00:51:25.196
Here I am
to let you know

614
00:51:25.269 --> 00:51:29.036
Take it back
and let it slow

615
00:51:29.107 --> 00:51:32.372
Take it back
and let it slow

616
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.410
Lust away from
all that ends

617
00:51:39.484 --> 00:51:42.920
Try to keep
all amends

618
00:51:42.987 --> 00:51:46.446
Try to keep all amends

619
00:51:49.895 --> 00:51:54.923
Your home

620
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.298
You hardly know it...

621
00:52:13.086 --> 00:52:14.678
- Oh! Jesus!
- Where were you?

622
00:52:14.754 --> 00:52:16.222
I was waiting for two hours.

623
00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.520
Trevor, settle down, man.
I was at dinner with Callahan.

624
00:52:18.592 --> 00:52:20.526
What? I told you,
we need to talk.

625
00:52:20.594 --> 00:52:23.392
All right.
What's going on?

626
00:52:23.464 --> 00:52:27.127
I've got a problem with
one of my investors.

627
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:29.761
- Who?
- Malcolm.

628
00:52:31.339 --> 00:52:34.366
- "Malcolm"?
- Are you playing with me?

629
00:52:34.443 --> 00:52:38.209
Malcolm, from the club.
We took his money. You closed the deal.

630
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.441
- Is your head fucked? Come on!
- Malcolm, of course.

631
00:52:40.515 --> 00:52:41.948
Yes. What's up?
What's going on?

632
00:52:42.017 --> 00:52:45.475
The money...
h-he-he... he wants it back.

633
00:52:45.554 --> 00:52:48.183
- All right. How much?
- All of it.

634
00:52:48.257 --> 00:52:50.817
- 250 grand.
- "250 grand"?

635
00:52:54.163 --> 00:52:57.860
- Did he do that to you?
- It was one of his guys, as a reminder.

636
00:52:57.934 --> 00:53:00.164
Just listen.
Listen to me, Nick.

637
00:53:00.236 --> 00:53:02.101
You've got to make
this happen, man, okay?

638
00:53:02.171 --> 00:53:03.832
'Cause I can't mess
around with this guy.

639
00:53:03.906 --> 00:53:05.397
I- I- I can't make him
wait anymore.

640
00:53:05.476 --> 00:53:08.240
Hey, Trevor...

641
00:53:08.312 --> 00:53:10.872
I'll talk to Ron.
I'll take care of it.

642
00:53:10.948 --> 00:53:14.042
It's no big deal.
All right?

643
00:53:14.118 --> 00:53:16.780
- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- All right, okay.

644
00:53:16.854 --> 00:53:20.222
- I owe you my life, man.
- No no. Dude.

645
00:53:21.326 --> 00:53:23.351
- It's all right.
- All right.

646
00:53:25.397 --> 00:53:27.661
Hey.

647
00:53:27.732 --> 00:53:30.724
You, uh... you talk
to Julie lately?

648
00:53:30.802 --> 00:53:33.532
No. Not in a while.
Why?

649
00:53:33.605 --> 00:53:35.766
I'm having a hard time
tracking her down.

650
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.365
Dude.

651
00:53:37.443 --> 00:53:40.241
You told me last time,
you're done with her, right?

652
00:53:43.215 --> 00:53:45.376
See you later.

653
00:54:26.795 --> 00:54:29.025
Ron.
How's it going, man?

654
00:54:29.097 --> 00:54:32.032
For shit.
Fuentes bailed.

655
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.068
What? You got to
be kidding me.

656
00:54:34.136 --> 00:54:36.161
After last night
I thought we had him.

657
00:54:36.238 --> 00:54:38.365
Yeah, well, fuck him.
His mistake.

658
00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.772
Oh, Jesus!

659
00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.738
Listen, I hate to
pile on, man, but, um,

660
00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:48.477
it seems we have a problem
with one of our investors.

661
00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.746
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.516
Guy Trevor brought in back
in July, gave us 250 grand?

663
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:57.219
Anyway, he says, uh...
he says he wants it back.

664
00:54:59.864 --> 00:55:03.027
- That's it?
- Yeah.

665
00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.034
That's pocket change.

666
00:55:05.102 --> 00:55:08.071
Why don't you just go get the checkbook
off my desk and write it yourself?

667
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:12.199
Ron, thank you so much, man.
I knew you'd understand.

668
00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:14.768
Why don't you write
a few more while you're at it?

669
00:55:14.846 --> 00:55:17.371
I mean, just go down to the corner
and pass 'em out with milk and cookies.

670
00:55:17.449 --> 00:55:19.212
I mean, if you really
want to give some money away.

671
00:55:19.284 --> 00:55:21.878
It's not like that, man.

672
00:55:21.953 --> 00:55:24.444
Nick,
we have contracts

673
00:55:24.523 --> 00:55:26.582
that specify how and when
people get paid back.

674
00:55:26.658 --> 00:55:30.095
I know. I understand.
Look, it is a one-time thing.

675
00:55:30.162 --> 00:55:32.357
I'll make it up to you
on the next deal.

676
00:55:34.867 --> 00:55:38.166
I don't get it. Were you asleep for our
entire conversation yesterday?

677
00:55:40.473 --> 00:55:42.464
Which... which one?

678
00:55:42.542 --> 00:55:44.908
The one where
I told you we're broke.

679
00:55:46.847 --> 00:55:50.339
- What?
- Nick, the money is gone.

680
00:55:50.417 --> 00:55:52.647
No matter how many times
we go over it, it is gone.

681
00:55:52.719 --> 00:55:55.711
We've spent it...
everything we had and more.

682
00:55:57.357 --> 00:56:00.417
- Ron, that's not possible.
- You wouldn't think so,

683
00:56:00.494 --> 00:56:03.020
but somehow we managed
to pull it off.

684
00:56:05.667 --> 00:56:07.635
What about
the Strike Line deal?

685
00:56:11.906 --> 00:56:14.875
Nick, you're
a good salesman.

686
00:56:14.943 --> 00:56:17.639
You've done a lot of
great things for my company.

687
00:56:17.712 --> 00:56:20.147
I'm glad I made you V. P. ,

688
00:56:20.215 --> 00:56:23.241
but let's face it...
you blew it on that one.

689
00:56:27.523 --> 00:56:29.514
What are you
talking about?

690
00:56:30.759 --> 00:56:32.784
You approached them
during Christmas.

691
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:34.796
We weren't ready.

692
00:56:34.864 --> 00:56:37.560
No matter how you look at it, Nick, you
scared them off. That's the truth.

693
00:56:41.304 --> 00:56:43.329
I didn't make
the Strike Line deal.

694
00:56:43.406 --> 00:56:46.102
Hell, you know,
if... if we had just nailed that deal,

695
00:56:46.176 --> 00:56:48.804
we'd actually probably have some
working software right now

696
00:56:48.878 --> 00:56:51.279
instead of this
pile of garbage.

697
00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:01.619
Hey.

698
00:57:01.692 --> 00:57:04.786
- So what's the story?
- Still working on it.

699
00:57:04.862 --> 00:57:08.856
Nick, come on, man.
I'm meeting Malcolm tonight.

700
00:57:08.934 --> 00:57:12.426
Hey. I'm gonna
take care of it.

701
00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.965
Okay.

702
00:57:23.282 --> 00:57:26.046
Julie.
Hey, it's, uh...

703
00:57:26.119 --> 00:57:28.280
it's me, Nick, again.

704
00:57:28.354 --> 00:57:30.447
Um...

705
00:57:30.523 --> 00:57:34.050
listen, I know that
there's some stuff between us,

706
00:57:34.127 --> 00:57:37.358
and you're obviously
not calling me back, but...

707
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.400
I'd really like
to talk to you.

708
00:57:40.467 --> 00:57:43.265
Happy belated birthday,
and, uh...

709
00:57:44.872 --> 00:57:46.840
I miss you.

710
00:58:08.129 --> 00:58:10.393
- Hello?
- Nick. Finally.

711
00:58:10.465 --> 00:58:12.627
- Oh, hey, Mom.
- How are you?

712
00:58:12.702 --> 00:58:15.432
Fine, uh, what's up?

713
00:58:15.504 --> 00:58:19.031
I've spoken to your father's doctor.
He'd like to see you.

714
00:58:19.108 --> 00:58:21.201
Will you talk to him?

715
00:58:22.311 --> 00:58:24.711
Why? What...
what do you mean?

716
00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:28.478
I'm concerned about you.
I really want to come and see you.

717
00:58:28.552 --> 00:58:31.919
- No no, I'm good, Mom. I'm fine.
- No, I really...

718
00:58:31.988 --> 00:58:33.649
Hey, listen, I got to go, okay?
I'll call you later.

719
00:58:33.724 --> 00:58:35.658
- Nick...
- I love you.

720
00:58:35.726 --> 00:58:37.694
Bye.

721
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:55.145
Let me see.
Oh, looks good, huh?

722
01:00:13.162 --> 01:00:15.130
Julie.

723
01:00:17.767 --> 01:00:20.235
Hey.

724
01:00:20.303 --> 01:00:22.363
Wow, I...

725
01:00:22.439 --> 01:00:24.634
hardly recognized you,
you look so different.

726
01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.108
Uh, thanks,
I think.

727
01:00:27.177 --> 01:00:29.941
No, I mean,
you look beautiful.

728
01:00:32.216 --> 01:00:34.684
Um, I left you a bunch of messages.
Did you get 'em?

729
01:00:34.751 --> 01:00:37.276
Yeah, I got 'em.

730
01:00:37.354 --> 01:00:39.346
Okay.

731
01:00:39.424 --> 01:00:41.415
I'm sorry.
I know I...

732
01:00:41.492 --> 01:00:44.950
I got a little carried away.
I just really wanted to talk to you.

733
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:48.692
Well, I'm standing here,
so go ahead.

734
01:00:48.766 --> 01:00:52.896
Um...
What are you doing?

735
01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:56.237
- I'm working.
- At a club?

736
01:00:56.308 --> 01:00:59.368
Yeah, at a club.
I'm shooting a fashion show.

737
01:00:59.445 --> 01:01:03.313
Well, that's cool.
Who hooked that up?

738
01:01:03.382 --> 01:01:07.375
Christopher. He introduced
me to a few people and it just took off.

739
01:01:07.453 --> 01:01:09.387
Wow.
Who's Christopher?

740
01:01:09.455 --> 01:01:11.151
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

741
01:01:11.224 --> 01:01:13.283
- You call me?
- I did.

742
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.022
- And who's this?
- Oh, uh, Nick.

743
01:01:16.096 --> 01:01:18.257
Old friend.
We're just catching up.

744
01:01:18.331 --> 01:01:22.028
Nick, she's the greatest, isn't she?
She's gonna be a star, aren't you, baby?

745
01:01:22.102 --> 01:01:24.036
Listen, I'm gonna
get another drink.

746
01:01:24.104 --> 01:01:25.537
- Can I get you something?
- Sure.

747
01:01:25.605 --> 01:01:27.733
- Nick?
- No, I'm good.

748
01:01:27.808 --> 01:01:29.298
All right

749
01:01:35.116 --> 01:01:37.050
Julie.
Julie.

750
01:01:37.118 --> 01:01:39.484
Listen,

751
01:01:39.553 --> 01:01:41.680
I know some stuff
went wrong with us,

752
01:01:41.756 --> 01:01:45.693
but you have to believe me, I never
meant for it to end up like this.

753
01:01:45.761 --> 01:01:47.752
Oh, cut the shit, Nick.
You know what?

754
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:49.660
You got everything exactly
the way you wanted it,

755
01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:51.289
so don't start caring
about me now.

756
01:01:51.366 --> 01:01:53.857
I am telling you,
whatever I said,

757
01:01:53.936 --> 01:01:56.029
whatever I did, whatever...
happened between us,

758
01:01:56.104 --> 01:01:58.368
just... just wipe it
out of your head.

759
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.968
Don't you get it?
I already have.

760
01:02:02.045 --> 01:02:05.378
You know, and all your talk
about your job

761
01:02:05.448 --> 01:02:07.678
and my career,
the future,

762
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:10.776
that's all it was,
Nick... talk.

763
01:02:10.853 --> 01:02:12.650
And now
I'm my own boss,

764
01:02:12.722 --> 01:02:16.181
and for the first time
I'm doing exactly what I want to do.

765
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.353
No, you're not.

766
01:02:20.264 --> 01:02:22.459
I know what you want,
and it's not this.

767
01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:25.828
- Things change.
- Not us.

768
01:02:25.903 --> 01:02:29.430
Julie, we can
start over.

769
01:02:30.808 --> 01:02:32.367
Just give me a chance.

770
01:02:37.248 --> 01:02:40.411
- That's her, isn't it?
- Who?

771
01:02:42.988 --> 01:02:44.956
Grace.

772
01:02:46.691 --> 01:02:49.183
Julie, no.

773
01:02:49.261 --> 01:02:52.128
You are the only thing
in this world that matters to me.

774
01:02:52.198 --> 01:02:55.065
I don't know how
I lost sight of that.

775
01:02:55.134 --> 01:02:57.261
I can fix this.

776
01:02:57.336 --> 01:02:59.702
I promise you I will.

777
01:03:00.806 --> 01:03:03.206
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

778
01:03:07.247 --> 01:03:09.215
Hey...

779
01:03:18.158 --> 01:03:20.218
Nick.
Oh, thank God.

780
01:03:20.294 --> 01:03:22.228
See, I told you
he'd show.

781
01:03:22.296 --> 01:03:23.763
I'm really glad
you could make it, Nick.

782
01:03:23.831 --> 01:03:25.492
- Malcolm, I assume.
- Yeah,

783
01:03:25.566 --> 01:03:28.558
- good to meet you face to face finally.
- And you.

784
01:03:28.636 --> 01:03:31.196
This is Wayne.
He owns half the club with me.

785
01:03:31.272 --> 01:03:33.866
Wayne?
Nick.

786
01:03:33.941 --> 01:03:35.933
Good luck.

787
01:03:38.947 --> 01:03:40.915
Have a seat.

788
01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.591
All right.

789
01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:55.395
Malcolm, this space
is fantastic.

790
01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:57.831
Thank you very much.

791
01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.673
Here we go.
A little black tea

792
01:04:05.742 --> 01:04:08.268
with ginseng
and mango.

793
01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.472
We call it
Chinese rocket fuel.

794
01:04:10.548 --> 01:04:12.482
Keeps you sharp,
mind and body.

795
01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.518
It seems to be
working for you.

796
01:04:16.454 --> 01:04:18.388
I know why
you're here.

797
01:04:18.456 --> 01:04:21.084
You want to renegotiate
your contract.

798
01:04:22.126 --> 01:04:23.855
Yes.

799
01:04:23.928 --> 01:04:26.329
Your friend made
a lot of promises.

800
01:04:26.398 --> 01:04:29.094
Said he could get me in on the ground
floor, triple my money with some sort of

801
01:04:29.167 --> 01:04:31.863
turbocharged
super-phone software,

802
01:04:31.937 --> 01:04:34.531
and I'm no expert,
but it sounded pretty good.

803
01:04:34.606 --> 01:04:36.836
And it is, Malcolm.

804
01:04:36.908 --> 01:04:38.842
That's all true.

805
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:42.347
It is an excellent product. I'm sure
your investment will see a great return.

806
01:04:42.415 --> 01:04:45.543
Malcolm, I'm not sure what
it is you're looking for,

807
01:04:45.618 --> 01:04:48.451
but if you look at your contract, you'll
see we're well within our timeline.

808
01:04:49.989 --> 01:04:52.116
Okay,
but at some time,

809
01:04:52.191 --> 01:04:55.388
I need to feel like there's some sort
of progress going on.

810
01:04:55.461 --> 01:04:59.296
Okay. Well, how can I
help you feel like that?

811
01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:03.069
See, we're part
of an organization.

812
01:05:03.137 --> 01:05:05.867
There's a chain of command.
It's the way things are done.

813
01:05:05.939 --> 01:05:08.271
Which is why we sign
contracts that specify

814
01:05:08.342 --> 01:05:10.469
how and when people
are paid back.

815
01:05:10.544 --> 01:05:14.174
You're a businessman.
You know how the whole thing works.

816
01:05:20.622 --> 01:05:22.852
Have you ever wished you could look
into the future?

817
01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:28.024
The Chinese believe it's possible just
by looking at a pattern of tea leaves.

818
01:05:28.096 --> 01:05:31.260
So... the question is,

819
01:05:32.535 --> 01:05:34.969
do I see a waterfall

820
01:05:35.037 --> 01:05:37.505
dripping with all the money
you guys are gonna make me?

821
01:05:38.707 --> 01:05:41.005
Or, uh,

822
01:05:41.076 --> 01:05:43.738
do I see a little bonfire
cooking as everything

823
01:05:43.812 --> 01:05:45.804
- I gave you goes up in smoke?
- That's not it, Malcolm.

824
01:05:45.882 --> 01:05:47.543
Well, I'm dying for you
to prove me otherwise.

825
01:05:48.952 --> 01:05:51.079
I think I can help.

826
01:05:51.154 --> 01:05:53.384
Because of your
relationship with Trevor

827
01:05:53.456 --> 01:05:55.390
and my confidence
in this product,

828
01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:58.052
I've written you
a personal check for 10%.

829
01:06:02.066 --> 01:06:05.797
25 thousand
out of 250?

830
01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:10.068
It's a Band-Aid
until your...

831
01:06:10.141 --> 01:06:12.371
your investment
sees its return.

832
01:06:15.913 --> 01:06:18.382
Band-Aids.
I love Band-Aids.

833
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:20.680
Now, you see?
I told you,

834
01:06:20.752 --> 01:06:24.848
Nick's on this now,
and he's gonna take care of everything.

835
01:06:31.563 --> 01:06:33.588
Well, it's better
than nothing,

836
01:06:33.665 --> 01:06:35.657
which is all I've gotten
from you so far.

837
01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:40.628
So, maybe it's time we cut out
the middlemen, right?

838
01:06:47.413 --> 01:06:49.313
No!

839
01:06:55.689 --> 01:06:58.522
Get him out.

840
01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:11.962
Nick?

841
01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:16.272
- No!
- What?

842
01:07:16.344 --> 01:07:18.278
Stay in here, okay?

843
01:07:18.346 --> 01:07:20.507
Come on, move, move!
Get out!

844
01:07:20.582 --> 01:07:23.017
Shit!
Get out! Now!

845
01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:25.645
Fuck! Fuck!

846
01:07:25.721 --> 01:07:27.712
Julie?

847
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.694
Julie?

848
01:07:32.762 --> 01:07:34.730
- Nick?
- No!

849
01:07:35.998 --> 01:07:38.091
No, Julie!
Fuck!

850
01:07:38.167 --> 01:07:40.693
- Oh, Julie! Oh, my God!
- What's happening?

851
01:07:40.771 --> 01:07:42.864
Shh. Shh.
I love you, baby.

852
01:07:42.939 --> 01:07:45.373
I love you.
You're okay, okay?

853
01:07:45.442 --> 01:07:47.808
Here. Don't look.
Here here. Hey, look at me.

854
01:07:47.878 --> 01:07:51.177
Look at me, look at me.
Everything's fine. Okay?

855
01:07:51.248 --> 01:07:53.113
You're okay. Shh.

856
01:07:53.183 --> 01:07:55.209
Breathe.

857
01:07:57.155 --> 01:07:59.316
Come on!

858
01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:01.449
Breathe.
Just breathe.

859
01:08:01.526 --> 01:08:03.323
All right.
All right.

860
01:08:39.265 --> 01:08:41.256
Oh, Grace!

861
01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.938
Oh, God.

862
01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:53.245
Found something that
would wake you up.

863
01:08:53.314 --> 01:08:55.248
What the fuck?

864
01:08:55.316 --> 01:08:58.285
Relax.
You're enjoying it.

865
01:08:59.855 --> 01:09:02.255
Your shit's on the floor.

866
01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:13.993
You want something
to drink?

867
01:09:21.177 --> 01:09:23.270
Who are you?

868
01:09:23.346 --> 01:09:25.439
Huh?

869
01:09:25.515 --> 01:09:28.575
How did I get here?

870
01:09:31.487 --> 01:09:34.616
You are
so bloody cute.

871
01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:40.688
- Answer the question.
- Get your hands off of me.

872
01:09:44.034 --> 01:09:47.435
You don't remember me?
We met at the club.

873
01:09:47.504 --> 01:09:50.099
Malcolm and I
are partners.

874
01:09:50.175 --> 01:09:53.667
On everything.
Which means I own half your ass.

875
01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:03.179
I understand you
owe us $250,000.

876
01:10:04.255 --> 01:10:06.281
If you hadda behaved yourself,

877
01:10:06.358 --> 01:10:09.452
I could've persuaded Malcolm
into reducing your bill,

878
01:10:09.528 --> 01:10:12.827
but now you're not going anywhere
until he gets here.

879
01:10:12.898 --> 01:10:14.832
Don't you get it?

880
01:10:30.884 --> 01:10:34.047
I'm sure your girlfriend
and Trevor would agree.

881
01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.054
Fuck you.

882
01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.791
I really screwed things up, Mom.

883
01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:49.462
I tried so hard
to fix everything, to just...

884
01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:52.506
make things right, and every time I do
I make it so much worse.

885
01:10:53.876 --> 01:10:56.037
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

886
01:10:56.111 --> 01:10:58.841
Don't. You remind me
of your father when you talk like that.

887
01:10:58.914 --> 01:11:02.042
- Why?
- You try to control everything.

888
01:11:05.888 --> 01:11:08.482
Mom, I want
to talk to Dad.

889
01:11:08.557 --> 01:11:11.152
No, you can...
you can't, okay?

890
01:11:11.227 --> 01:11:13.957
You don't understand.
It's really important.

891
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:16.624
- No, you don't understand.
- Mom, you've gotta help me find him.

892
01:11:16.699 --> 01:11:18.394
Nick, he's dead.

893
01:11:21.738 --> 01:11:23.933
He committed suicide.

894
01:11:26.877 --> 01:11:28.504
Why would you
keep that from me?

895
01:11:28.579 --> 01:11:30.240
I don't know.

896
01:11:30.314 --> 01:11:32.111
I didn't want you
to remember him like that.

897
01:11:32.182 --> 01:11:35.948
The point is, Nick, it's you
I'm worried about.

898
01:11:37.221 --> 01:11:40.486
You can't do this alone.

899
01:11:40.558 --> 01:11:43.357
You need to see a doctor.

900
01:11:43.428 --> 01:11:46.556
You don't have to
have the same fate as your father.

901
01:11:47.732 --> 01:11:50.667
Nick, you can't
control everything.

902
01:11:50.735 --> 01:11:52.896
You have to let it go.

903
01:12:04.684 --> 01:12:06.618
Another drink, please.

904
01:12:11.824 --> 01:12:13.314
Thanks.

905
01:12:16.163 --> 01:12:19.098
Nick.
What's going on?

906
01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:21.225
Oh my God.

907
01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:23.166
What happened to you?

908
01:12:29.676 --> 01:12:31.702
Did you bring it?

909
01:12:38.486 --> 01:12:40.215
Where is Trevor?

910
01:12:42.724 --> 01:12:44.885
I can't believe that
was only a year ago.

911
01:12:44.959 --> 01:12:47.155
I know
something's wrong.

912
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:49.663
First, Trevor comes home
with a black eye.

913
01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:51.962
Then he says you have
some meeting together,

914
01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.661
but he doesn't
come home at all.

915
01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:56.068
And now you want me
to bring you some old picture?

916
01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:02.777
Nick, I'm really scared.

917
01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:04.677
I know.

918
01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:10.143
You know that
I'd do anything for Trevor, don't you?

919
01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:15.416
I'd do anything
for all you guys.

920
01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:19.629
Yeah.

921
01:13:21.265 --> 01:13:22.789
Come here.

922
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:28.529
I know you're scared.

923
01:13:35.013 --> 01:13:37.106
I can't explain it...

924
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:41.148
but I promise you
that Trevor's okay.

925
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:38.101
Oh, great, guys.

926
01:14:38.179 --> 01:14:40.011
Check it out...

927
01:14:40.082 --> 01:14:43.279
I brought my own special
birthday candle.

928
01:14:43.352 --> 01:14:44.944
- Yes!
- It's drugs!

929
01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.851
Oh! My favorite.

930
01:14:46.922 --> 01:14:48.947
Light it!

931
01:14:53.162 --> 01:14:55.357
- Light it.
- Yes yes.

932
01:14:57.134 --> 01:14:59.068
Where are you going?

933
01:14:59.136 --> 01:15:01.764
- Somewhere.
- Oh, really?

934
01:15:01.838 --> 01:15:03.863
With you.

935
01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.669
Okay.

936
01:15:07.377 --> 01:15:09.504
I need to talk
to you alone.

937
01:15:09.579 --> 01:15:11.206
Oh.

938
01:15:13.017 --> 01:15:14.951
Put this on,
it might get cold.

939
01:15:15.019 --> 01:15:17.044
Hmm.

940
01:15:21.893 --> 01:15:24.794
Ah. This looks exactly
the same as it did

941
01:15:24.862 --> 01:15:26.830
when you first
brought me here.

942
01:15:27.932 --> 01:15:30.493
I can't believe...
when was that?

943
01:15:30.569 --> 01:15:33.197
- Three years ago.
- Three years ago.

944
01:15:33.272 --> 01:15:34.796
Wow.

945
01:15:36.375 --> 01:15:38.866
I can't imagine my life
without you now.

946
01:15:42.514 --> 01:15:44.415
Nick, I want
to tell you something.

947
01:15:44.484 --> 01:15:46.145
Me first.

948
01:15:46.219 --> 01:15:47.777
Okay.

949
01:15:48.988 --> 01:15:50.683
You need
to go to New York.

950
01:15:52.659 --> 01:15:54.854
- What?
- I know that it sounds strange,

951
01:15:54.928 --> 01:15:57.123
but trust me,
it's for the best.

952
01:15:57.197 --> 01:15:58.892
Where is this coming from?

953
01:15:58.965 --> 01:16:01.833
This is your chance
to pursue your art,

954
01:16:01.902 --> 01:16:03.893
to... find out
about yourself,

955
01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:06.769
to not have to worry
about me or us or my job

956
01:16:06.841 --> 01:16:08.968
or all that
other bullshit, just...

957
01:16:09.043 --> 01:16:10.977
- I don't want to be free.
- Listen to me.

958
01:16:11.045 --> 01:16:13.878
This is
your last chance to...

959
01:16:16.517 --> 01:16:19.043
pursue your own path
in life,

960
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.815
one that
I can't fuck up.

961
01:16:22.624 --> 01:16:25.320
Well, I don't want to pursue
my own path. That wasn't the deal.

962
01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:26.883
- Listen.
- We were going to do this together

963
01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:29.453
and we were gonna work it out,
and you promised you would be there.

964
01:16:29.531 --> 01:16:32.091
Just trust me, I know, baby.
I don't think you're getting it.

965
01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:33.726
Julie...

966
01:16:43.379 --> 01:16:46.371
I just need a little
space myself right now.

967
01:16:49.853 --> 01:16:51.821
I'm sorry.

968
01:16:54.892 --> 01:16:56.860
You're breaking up with me?

969
01:16:58.295 --> 01:17:00.889
- That's it?
- Yeah.

970
01:17:03.634 --> 01:17:06.433
I don't think
there's anything left to be said.

971
01:17:18.883 --> 01:17:20.578
Nick, I'm pregnant.

972
01:17:43.543 --> 01:17:45.408
Trevor.

973
01:17:45.478 --> 01:17:47.742
Where's Julie?

974
01:17:47.814 --> 01:17:49.748
- What happened?
- Yeah, dude, she ran down here,

975
01:17:49.816 --> 01:17:51.977
grabbed your keys
and took off to your car.

976
01:18:03.965 --> 01:18:06.832
No! Oh God!

977
01:18:11.807 --> 01:18:14.298
- All right, here we go.
- Keep going to the point and back.

978
01:18:23.785 --> 01:18:26.448
Hey, man, what are you doing?
That's my car!

979
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:56.251
Slow down.
Please, slow down.

980
01:18:59.524 --> 01:19:01.651
Oh God.

981
01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:07.425
- Oh, you've got to be kidding.
- Julie!

982
01:19:21.747 --> 01:19:25.308
- God!
- Pull over, Julie, please!

983
01:19:25.384 --> 01:19:26.681
Please, pull over.

984
01:19:26.752 --> 01:19:29.243
I'm sorry!
I love you!

985
01:19:29.321 --> 01:19:32.223
I didn't know!
I'm sorry!

986
01:19:32.292 --> 01:19:35.693
Julie, you have to
pull over!

987
01:19:35.762 --> 01:19:38.390
Pull over!
You don't understand!

988
01:19:38.465 --> 01:19:39.796
Please!

989
01:19:45.705 --> 01:19:47.435
Oh my God.

990
01:19:50.178 --> 01:19:51.975
I love you.

991
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:08.525
I would do anything
for all you guys.

992
01:20:08.597 --> 01:20:10.929
You know that,
don't you?

993
01:20:46.604 --> 01:20:48.572
Hey, Nick.
You're awake.

994
01:20:49.907 --> 01:20:52.172
Come on, baby,
we've got a big day.

995
01:20:52.244 --> 01:20:54.109
I've got class
in a half-hour.

996
01:20:58.183 --> 01:21:00.515
Ah...

997
01:21:00.585 --> 01:21:02.712
That's right,
Nicky, yeah!

998
01:21:02.787 --> 01:21:05.051
Aw...

999
01:21:05.123 --> 01:21:07.387
Mommy has to go to class
in a half an hour.

1000
01:21:07.459 --> 01:21:10.020
That's right. Okay?

1001
01:21:10.096 --> 01:21:12.792
I'm gonna drop you off
at Grandma's. Yeah!
