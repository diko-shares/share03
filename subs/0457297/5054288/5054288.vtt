1
00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:52.874
This spot is beautiful.

2
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.145
Yeah, it really is.

3
00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.052
You guys are lucky. I didn't have
a place like this where I grew up.

4
00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:00.556
What are you talking about?
You grew up like half an hourfrom here.

5
00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.253
Whatever. My parents
didn't let me out much.

6
00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:05.921
Yeah, well, it was
really amazing for us.

7
00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:08.864
In high school we used to sneak out
and come here all the time.

8
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.924
That's right.
Late-night rendezvous. In fact,

9
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:15.063
we shared ourfirst bottle
of tequila right here at this very spot.

10
00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.472
Wow. I am impressed
that you even rememberthat.

11
00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:20.977
"I am impressed that
you even rememberthat."

12
00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:23.570
So do you guys feel like
you were the same as you were back then?

13
00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:25.639
Well, I know I'm
exactly the same.

14
00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:28.583
I still have absolutely no idea what
I want to do when I grow up.

15
00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:31.417
Well, hey, you used to
work at Foot Locker, and I'm sure

16
00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:33.514
if you went back and asked,
they'd give you the job.

17
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.752
- Very funny.
- What about you, Nick?

18
00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:38.125
- Have you changed much?
- Mmm-mm.

19
00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:42.824
Although I must say,
Trevor has gotten way hotter.

20
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.733
You know that that is a fact,
my friend, okay?

21
00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:48.271
My jaw is way wider now.
It's striking.

22
00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:51.135
All right, loverboy.
How about you and me

23
00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.370
go get some wood
forthis fire, huh?

24
00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.411
All right,
take care.

25
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.644
I got a really good feeling about
the next couple of months.

26
00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.879
Yeah? Why is that?

27
00:02:02.954 --> 00:02:05.548
If we just close a couple
of our own accounts,

28
00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:07.784
you know how huge
that could be for us?

29
00:02:09.393 --> 00:02:13.329
Yeah, I mean, retiring early
would be very nice.

30
00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:15.331
By 30?

31
00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.959
Oh, shit.
Look, look.

32
00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:19.161
Gross, dude.

33
00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:21.228
Come here. What, you
afraid of a little crab?

34
00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:22.829
Gross, dude!
Those things are just sick! Don't!

35
00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:25.398
- Come on. Come on.
- No, don't! Dude, don't! Don't!

36
00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:27.000
Fucking pussy.

37
00:02:27.078 --> 00:02:30.844
This is so exciting!

38
00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:33.383
Yeah. Maybe I should
wait till tomorrow.

39
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.352
No, you have to
tell him tonight.

40
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.354
Hey. Took you guys
long enough.

41
00:02:38.422 --> 00:02:40.481
What are you
talking about?

42
00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:44.185
There it goes.
There it goes. Okay, ready?

43
00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:46.822
Nice. Yeah, I'm ready.

44
00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:49.423
- Happy birthday!
- Oh!

45
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.991
- Oh, they went out. Relight.
- Wait wait.

46
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.902
- All right.
- Okay, now make a wish.

47
00:02:54.972 --> 00:02:57.202
I can't.
Everything's perfect.

48
00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:58.674
- That's lame.
- Oh. Oh, sweetie.

49
00:02:58.743 --> 00:02:59.835
Whatever, dude.

50
00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:01.606
If you need something,
I've got a whole list of things.

51
00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.738
- How about a million dollars?
- Blow 'em out, already.

52
00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:05.975
- Let's do this.
- All right, all right!

53
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.881
- Yay!
- No!

54
00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:10.682
- Come on. No. I bought 'em.
- It's my birthday cake.

55
00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:13.053
- I want it in the shot.
- In what shot?

56
00:03:13.124 --> 00:03:15.991
- Good idea, okay.
- Behave.

57
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.118
- Okay, everybody.
- Come on, hurry up, I want a cupcake.

58
00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:19.060
I know, just hold your horses
for a minute, all right?

59
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.065
- Art. It's perfection.
- It's kinda ghetto frosting.

60
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:23.794
- That's good though.
- That's my favorite.

61
00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:25.199
Yup. Are you ready?

62
00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.328
Yes.

63
00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:30.397
- Everybody say "chingas."
- Chingas.

64
00:03:33.077 --> 00:03:35.477
- Good, guys.
- Chingas.

65
00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:37.844
Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:39.746
I brought my own
special kind of birthday candle.

67
00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:41.910
- All right.
- Drugs!

68
00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:43.578
- You kids have fun.
- That is awesome.

69
00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:46.555
- Light it up.
- Come here.

70
00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.760
- Hey, where are you going?
- Somewhere.

71
00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:51.954
- Really?
- With you.

72
00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.327
- Okay.
- Camera, please.

73
00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:56.662
- Yes, sir.
- Put this on.

74
00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:01.328
- All right.
- This is kind of exciting.

75
00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:05.501
- Oh, I will now be blindfolding you.
- Really?

76
00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:09.444
- Are you going to take advantage of me?
- Mm, I might.

77
00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:12.812
- All right, hold this.
- Okay.

78
00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:15.545
- And...
- Oh!

79
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.986
- We shall return.
- See you later.

80
00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:20.285
Don't worry
about me.

81
00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:26.595
- Open.
- Oh.

82
00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:30.762
Rememberthe first time
we came here?

83
00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:33.395
Yeah. What was that,
like three years ago?

84
00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:34.631
Yeah.

85
00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:40.143
Nick, um,
there's something

86
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:42.236
that I want to
tell you.

87
00:04:42.313 --> 00:04:44.281
Me first.

88
00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.417
Happy birthday.

89
00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:50.147
Nick! Oh!

90
00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.819
- It's beautiful.
- Wish it was a diamond, but...

91
00:04:55.893 --> 00:04:58.760
Well, I love it.
I love you.

92
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:04.862
Here, put it on.

93
00:05:07.438 --> 00:05:11.238
So, tell me again I'm not crazy and I
shouldn't go get my master's.

94
00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:13.709
Oh, no, you should.
You should go pay some

95
00:05:13.778 --> 00:05:16.269
art-school lifer
to grade your pictures.

96
00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:19.282
I don't have to pay them.
I can use my grant money.

97
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.648
You get the point.

98
00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.951
And more importantly, it's in New York,
which is 3,000 miles away from me.

99
00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:27.251
I know.

100
00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:29.885
My job is about to blow up.
I promise you.

101
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.326
I'm gonna have the money so we can
open your own gallery.

102
00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:35.126
You can shoot
your own pictures,

103
00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.032
just like we
talked about.

104
00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:41.265
- Isn't that what you want?
- Of course.

105
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:49.545
This is perfect.

106
00:05:49.613 --> 00:05:51.478
- Hey, don't get that, okay?
- Hey. Oh, where is it?

107
00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:52.948
Remember, I wanted to
tell you something.

108
00:05:53.017 --> 00:05:55.577
I know.
Just give me one second.

109
00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.224
It's work.
Hold on.

110
00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:03.658
Hello?

111
00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:06.196
Yeah.

112
00:06:06.263 --> 00:06:08.231
Oh, okay.

113
00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:13.327
Right. No no no, it's not...
it's not a problem.

114
00:06:14.672 --> 00:06:16.765
All right.
Bye-bye.

115
00:06:19.643 --> 00:06:21.804
It was Bristol.
I have to go to work.

116
00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.780
Yeah, and it's my birthday,
so call him back,

117
00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.510
tell him you're sick.
You just can't go.

118
00:06:26.584 --> 00:06:30.179
Listen.
If you do this for me,

119
00:06:30.254 --> 00:06:32.313
we will come back
here next year,

120
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.381
and we will stay
the whole weekend,

121
00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.790
and we'll get
a hotel room, and...

122
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.597
Baby?

123
00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:45.294
Help me out here. I really need to go
to this meeting.

124
00:06:47.438 --> 00:06:49.406
No, forget it.

125
00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:54.711
I want a week.

126
00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:59.213
- Aweek?
- That's right.

127
00:06:59.283 --> 00:07:02.684
You and me
and no cell phones.

128
00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:06.818
You can personally

129
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:09.485
smash this thing
before we leave.

130
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.619
How's that?

131
00:07:13.297 --> 00:07:15.265
Okay.

132
00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:18.831
Actually, you know what?
Why wait? I say...

133
00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:20.871
we just drown this thing now
to make sure.

134
00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:23.600
Oh! Oh! Oh, that's...
I don't think so.

135
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.577
Give us something
to talk about

136
00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:33.083
Take yourtime...

137
00:07:39.156 --> 00:07:42.455
Aw, shit. Baby, did you remember
my sunglasses?

138
00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:44.517
Mm? What would you
do without me?

139
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:50.523
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

140
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:52.967
Yeah, a dick who's gonna
get promoted instead of me

141
00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:54.061
if I flake on this meeting.

142
00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:57.665
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays then?
- And Julie's birthday.

143
00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:00.710
If I want to beat 'em,
I have to join 'em.

144
00:08:00.778 --> 00:08:03.008
- Right now!
- Don't.

145
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.538
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
just should blow the whole thing off.

146
00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:09.609
Yeah, you know, you're right.
I don't need this job anyway.

147
00:08:09.687 --> 00:08:12.485
Great idea. And when you get fired
I'm sure Trevor will last

148
00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:15.024
about two weeks
at work without you.

149
00:08:15.092 --> 00:08:17.083
Why do you
have to say that?

150
00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:19.959
Wait, guys.
Hold up, hold up.

151
00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:25.602
Okay.
Nice.

152
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.362
You know what, baby?
You can move to New York with me,

153
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.203
and we could be
starving artists together.

154
00:08:31.275 --> 00:08:32.708
Wouldn't that be perfect, hon?

155
00:08:32.776 --> 00:08:34.505
Sounds like you
have it all worked out.

156
00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.874
Shit!
Hold on!

157
00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:42.177
Oh God!

158
00:08:44.989 --> 00:08:47.753
- Is everyone all right?
- You okay? You okay?

159
00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:49.759
- I think so.
- Are you sure?

160
00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:52.318
- Oh! Oh God!
- Oh, shit!

161
00:08:53.731 --> 00:08:56.495
Nick, move! Ah!

162
00:10:08.372 --> 00:10:10.806
Nick.

163
00:10:10.874 --> 00:10:13.138
Oh, Nick.

164
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.144
Shh.

165
00:10:16.947 --> 00:10:18.744
Shh. Shh.

166
00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:20.909
Nick, it's okay.

167
00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:28.983
Room 9, we've got a code blue.
He's gone into attack.

168
00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:33.189
190 and rising.

169
00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:39.700
Shh, Nick.
Shh.

170
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.761
Nick...

171
00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:47.603
It's okay.

172
00:10:53.317 --> 00:10:55.979
He gets nightmares
sometimes.

173
00:10:57.087 --> 00:10:59.385
He always has.

174
00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:33.585
Nick.

175
00:11:33.657 --> 00:11:35.625
Oh, Nick!

176
00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:52.298
Where's Julie?

177
00:11:52.376 --> 00:11:55.140
Honey, she's...

178
00:11:57.181 --> 00:11:59.979
- Where are they?
- They didn't...

179
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.280
- No. No.
- Nick...

180
00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:19.800
Okay, everybody.

181
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.804
- Just hold your horses for a minute.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

182
00:12:27.745 --> 00:12:30.680
- Yay! Come on!
- No!

183
00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:46.462
You know what? I cannot imagine
my life without you now.

184
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.346
You know, I was thinking...
if you, um...

185
00:13:05.415 --> 00:13:08.578
if you really need a change
of scenery or whatever,

186
00:13:08.652 --> 00:13:11.519
I've got some extra
room at my place.

187
00:13:11.588 --> 00:13:13.988
For what?

188
00:13:14.057 --> 00:13:16.548
You.

189
00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:19.653
I want you
to live with me.

190
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.575
Nick, it's Mom.

191
00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:15.447
How you feeling?
I spoke to the doctor.

192
00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:18.317
He said you canceled
your appointment again.

193
00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:20.982
Nick, you've got to
take care of yourself.

194
00:14:21.058 --> 00:14:24.084
You don't want the headaches
to get any worse.

195
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:27.096
Please, call me.

196
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:20.683
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

197
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:23.379
- Thought you were out sick.
- No.

198
00:15:23.453 --> 00:15:27.184
Bristol's looking foryou.
Just a heads up.

199
00:15:27.257 --> 00:15:29.225
Thanks, man.

200
00:15:30.827 --> 00:15:33.762
- You don't pick up your phone?
- Oh, I was in the copy room.

201
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.990
I need those spreadsheets.

202
00:15:35.065 --> 00:15:37.226
Yeah, I put 'em on your desk
last night.

203
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:39.769
I was here until 7:00.

204
00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:42.100
Afterthat.
Did you check your inbox?

205
00:15:42.172 --> 00:15:44.868
Look, I'm telling you
I can't find 'em, so just...

206
00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:47.467
print me up a new report,
spare me the boring fairy tale.

207
00:15:47.544 --> 00:15:49.512
We've got the Rosemont
Equities meeting, one hour.

208
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.740
Wait. What are you
talking about?

209
00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:54.850
11:00,
sales presentation...

210
00:15:54.918 --> 00:15:57.443
- I thought that was at 4:00.
- I had to move it, okay?

211
00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:59.648
And you're just
telling me this now?

212
00:15:59.723 --> 00:16:01.987
Look, Nick,

213
00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:05.654
80% of all start-ups fail in the first
two years. It is an uphill battle.

214
00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:09.130
Everyone's got to pull
their own weight. No exceptions.

215
00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:13.135
Okay. No problem.
I'll have the spreadsheets.

216
00:16:13.203 --> 00:16:15.831
I can give the pitch myself if you think
you can't handle it.

217
00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:17.601
I said no problem.

218
00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:21.105
Okay.

219
00:16:21.178 --> 00:16:23.146
You keep
your shit together.

220
00:16:23.213 --> 00:16:25.681
Okay? I can't have you pop another
brain fart and fuck this thing up.

221
00:16:27.117 --> 00:16:29.585
Clean up your desk.
It's a mess.

222
00:16:31.388 --> 00:16:34.152
What we're talking about is software
that will enable your handheld

223
00:16:34.224 --> 00:16:37.352
to communicate with
any wireless technology.

224
00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:41.864
Imagine being able to access
all of yourtechnology from here.

225
00:16:41.932 --> 00:16:44.799
Picture it. Say you're in a cab
on your way to a meeting.

226
00:16:44.868 --> 00:16:48.395
You're checking your e-mails,
you're surfing the web, a call comes in.

227
00:16:48.472 --> 00:16:52.033
Well, your new client decides
that they need additional product images

228
00:16:52.109 --> 00:16:55.476
to be included in the presentation
that you're giving in an hour.

229
00:16:55.545 --> 00:16:57.945
You rush over
to the job site

230
00:16:58.015 --> 00:17:01.542
snap a couple of jpegs,
get to your meeting.

231
00:17:02.652 --> 00:17:05.280
And gentlemen,
what you've got

232
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.416
is a slideshow
in your pocket.

233
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.133
Okay, so...

234
00:17:20.203 --> 00:17:23.138
everyone's developing
next-gen software for handhelds,

235
00:17:23.206 --> 00:17:26.141
including the big guys.

236
00:17:26.209 --> 00:17:28.700
Why put money into yours?

237
00:17:28.779 --> 00:17:30.713
Because ours
is ready now.

238
00:17:30.781 --> 00:17:32.840
We, with our partners
at Strike Line, believe

239
00:17:32.916 --> 00:17:35.441
we can have this on the market
within the quarter.

240
00:17:52.335 --> 00:17:55.133
- Nick.
- Is he having a seizure or what?

241
00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:59.642
No, he gets headaches.
Nick! Nick!

242
00:18:11.588 --> 00:18:13.613
I'm so sorry.

243
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.519
I swear, if I get
one more S.E.C. Notice,

244
00:18:18.595 --> 00:18:21.996
I'm gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

245
00:18:22.065 --> 00:18:25.091
Yeah, the weather's
nice there.

246
00:18:25.168 --> 00:18:27.659
I'm... sorry about
the meeting, sir.

247
00:18:27.737 --> 00:18:30.968
Nick, I shouldn't
have to tell you...

248
00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:34.067
80% of all start-ups fail
within the first two years.

249
00:18:34.144 --> 00:18:36.271
We make one mistake,
it affects everything.

250
00:18:36.346 --> 00:18:38.007
We can't go back
and do this over again.

251
00:18:38.081 --> 00:18:40.777
You're absolutely
right.

252
00:18:40.851 --> 00:18:44.116
I assure you this will
not happen again.

253
00:18:44.187 --> 00:18:47.315
Dave tells me you've been
having some problems lately

254
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.324
with concentrating
and remembering stuff.

255
00:18:49.392 --> 00:18:51.917
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

256
00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:54.122
Really, it's...
it's not a big deal.

257
00:18:54.197 --> 00:18:55.721
I want you to just go home,

258
00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:58.324
take the rest of the week off
and recharge the batteries.

259
00:18:58.401 --> 00:19:01.199
- Mr. Callahan, really, I can work.
- Nick...

260
00:19:01.271 --> 00:19:03.398
I need to work.

261
00:19:03.473 --> 00:19:06.909
It's done.
Just go home.

262
00:19:08.745 --> 00:19:11.043
We'll see you in a week.

263
00:19:24.027 --> 00:19:26.860
Always searching

264
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:31.594
Looking forthe one
to wrap your soul

265
00:19:31.668 --> 00:19:33.693
Around

266
00:19:36.072 --> 00:19:40.509
Sing the one name
as you let go

267
00:19:40.577 --> 00:19:43.205
The fear of flying

268
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.215
You're on your way

269
00:19:46.283 --> 00:19:49.912
Endless love

270
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.155
And you say

271
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.437
You're gonna turn
time around...

272
00:20:18.348 --> 00:20:20.509
Oh, man.

273
00:20:50.113 --> 00:20:52.877
Oh, shit. Baby, did you
grab my sunglasses?

274
00:20:52.949 --> 00:20:56.009
Mm? What would you
do without me?

275
00:21:00.957 --> 00:21:02.925
Hmm?

276
00:21:08.031 --> 00:21:11.194
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

277
00:21:11.268 --> 00:21:13.202
Yeah, a dick
who'll get promoted

278
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.034
instead of me if I flake
on this meeting.

279
00:21:16.106 --> 00:21:19.598
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays?
- And Julie's birthday.

280
00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:24.211
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
should just blow the whole thing off.

281
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:28.217
You're right.
I don't really need this job anyway.

282
00:21:29.419 --> 00:21:31.353
Yeah.
Great idea.

283
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:33.321
I'm sure when you get fired,
Trevor will last

284
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.483
- two weeks at work without you, maybe.
- "Two weeks at work without you."

285
00:21:35.558 --> 00:21:38.857
- Why you got to say that?
- What?

286
00:21:38.928 --> 00:21:41.488
Ooh, guys, wait.
I want to get a picture of this.

287
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.564
Nice. And you
know what, honey?

288
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.575
You can move to New York with me
and we can be starving artists together.

289
00:21:53.643 --> 00:21:56.077
- Isn't that a perfect idea?
- Put your seat belt on.

290
00:21:56.146 --> 00:21:58.580
- What?
- Put it on!

291
00:22:00.283 --> 00:22:02.513
Okay. Shit.

292
00:22:21.271 --> 00:22:23.705
I think so.

293
00:23:55.031 --> 00:23:58.091
Hey, pumpkin. Hey, do you know
what you're gonna wear?

294
00:24:08.478 --> 00:24:10.673
What's happening?

295
00:24:10.747 --> 00:24:12.715
Are you okay?

296
00:24:18.354 --> 00:24:20.322
Nick?

297
00:24:39.075 --> 00:24:41.009
Oh, Nick,
are you okay?

298
00:24:41.077 --> 00:24:43.978
What's wrong, huh?
Huh?

299
00:24:47.016 --> 00:24:49.814
What's the matter?

300
00:24:49.886 --> 00:24:51.877
I think I was
having a nightmare.

301
00:24:51.955 --> 00:24:53.946
Oh, baby!
It's okay.

302
00:24:54.023 --> 00:24:56.514
All right?
It's all over now. It's all over.

303
00:24:58.361 --> 00:25:00.659
Oh, shh.

304
00:25:06.836 --> 00:25:09.327
Oh, God!

305
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.106
Okay?
Now let's get going.

306
00:25:13.176 --> 00:25:15.337
We'll celebrate my birthday.
It'll be fun.

307
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.313
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go get ready. All right.

308
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.910
Okay.

309
00:25:31.194 --> 00:25:34.493
I know how weird it sounds.
It's just...

310
00:25:34.564 --> 00:25:36.896
I can't explain it.
I...

311
00:25:36.966 --> 00:25:40.026
there's this entire
other version

312
00:25:40.103 --> 00:25:42.094
of my life
without you.

313
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:45.766
I went through
a whole year

314
00:25:45.842 --> 00:25:48.572
believing you were dead.

315
00:25:48.645 --> 00:25:52.604
And then ljust...
ljust wake up, and there you are.

316
00:25:52.682 --> 00:25:56.140
Okay, it was just
a bad dream, all right?

317
00:25:56.219 --> 00:25:57.948
It wasn't real.

318
00:25:58.021 --> 00:26:00.990
I'm here.
Come on.

319
00:26:03.693 --> 00:26:05.888
I hearyou, I do,

320
00:26:05.962 --> 00:26:09.625
but it's just I'm having
a really difficult time believing it.

321
00:26:09.699 --> 00:26:12.133
It's been
a traumatic year

322
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:14.499
for both of us, okay?

323
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:18.200
- But we made it.
- It's not that.

324
00:26:18.274 --> 00:26:20.105
Hey.

325
00:26:22.245 --> 00:26:24.440
I am here.

326
00:26:26.816 --> 00:26:29.182
And that's all
that matters.

327
00:26:33.022 --> 00:26:35.889
All right.

328
00:26:35.959 --> 00:26:38.689
- You're right.
- I know.

329
00:26:38.761 --> 00:26:42.094
Oh, fuck.
You're right.

330
00:26:42.165 --> 00:26:44.895
Hi.
Sorry we're late.

331
00:26:44.968 --> 00:26:46.902
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

332
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.632
- Happy 25th, old lady.
- Oh!

333
00:26:49.706 --> 00:26:52.641
How's it going, man?

334
00:26:52.709 --> 00:26:54.643
Good.

335
00:26:54.711 --> 00:26:57.578
It is really
frickin' good!

336
00:26:57.647 --> 00:27:00.548
Oh, it's good to
see you, man!

337
00:27:00.617 --> 00:27:02.448
Yeah, it's good.
Good.

338
00:27:04.487 --> 00:27:08.014
You two,
you look amazing!

339
00:27:08.091 --> 00:27:10.082
Oh, how much has
he had to drink?

340
00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:13.185
Well, it's been
a long night.

341
00:27:13.262 --> 00:27:16.288
Speaking of which,
why don't, uh...

342
00:27:16.366 --> 00:27:18.596
- Yes, let's.
...you and I do the...

343
00:27:18.668 --> 00:27:20.602
- Right.
- Okay.

344
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.037
...and you two...
good. All right.

345
00:27:24.107 --> 00:27:26.473
Hey, how's it goin', man?
Two MGDs,

346
00:27:26.542 --> 00:27:29.136
Jack on the rocks
and a house red, please.

347
00:27:29.212 --> 00:27:31.703
Please tell me that you
locked down the strippers.

348
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:35.083
The strippers?

349
00:27:35.151 --> 00:27:37.915
For my bachelor party.

350
00:27:37.987 --> 00:27:40.581
Your bachelor party?

351
00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:45.953
Because... you two
are getting married,

352
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:48.589
and I'm...
the best man.

353
00:27:48.665 --> 00:27:51.657
Which means I would have
locked down the strippers.

354
00:27:51.734 --> 00:27:54.532
Of course I did,
dumb-ass!

355
00:27:54.604 --> 00:27:56.538
- You're scaring me, man.
- Dude, I got the...

356
00:27:56.606 --> 00:27:59.370
10 hottest
strippers ever.

357
00:28:00.543 --> 00:28:02.943
10?

358
00:28:03.012 --> 00:28:05.742
Awesome! Thanks.
Thank you.

359
00:28:05.815 --> 00:28:07.806
I am...

360
00:28:09.452 --> 00:28:12.649
I am so psyched
foryou guys!

361
00:28:12.722 --> 00:28:14.713
Oh. Okay.

362
00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:05.838
Do you still think
you're dreaming?

363
00:29:05.908 --> 00:29:10.038
Baby, what's wrong?
Baby, what's wrong?

364
00:29:10.113 --> 00:29:12.604
Nothing.

365
00:29:45.214 --> 00:29:47.808
- I love you.
- I love you.

366
00:29:54.223 --> 00:29:56.714
- Oh god.
- All right, baby.

367
00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:49.173
"Migraines have been linked
to seizures in recent studies.

368
00:30:49.245 --> 00:30:51.509
Patients with a high frequency
of migraine attacks

00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:54.243
are at greater risk
for cerebral strokes.

370

This progressive brain disease

00:30:56.686 --> 00:31:00.486
acute and selected
memory loss.

372
00:31:00.556 --> 00:31:03.150

delusions, hallucinations, hearing
things that are not actually present..."

"Schizophrenia refers to
a split between emotion and thought."

376
00:31:36.592 --> 00:31:39.789
which in its end stages

377
00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:06.851
Hey!
How ya feelin'?

378
00:32:06.923 --> 00:32:09.721
Oh, busted.
Looking at porn. Again.

379
00:32:09.792 --> 00:32:11.089
- Yeah.
- By the way,

380
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.787
you were really
fucked up last night, man.

381
00:32:12.862 --> 00:32:14.989
Yeah, I had
a couple of drinks.

382
00:32:15.064 --> 00:32:17.430
- Yeah, a couple.
- Um...

383
00:32:19.802 --> 00:32:22.703
What?

384
00:32:22.772 --> 00:32:26.037
Hey, guys. Bristol just called
a staff meeting.

385
00:32:26.108 --> 00:32:27.769
Conference room, five minutes.

386
00:32:27.843 --> 00:32:29.470
Oh, God. What does
that prick want now?

387
00:32:29.545 --> 00:32:32.378
I don't know, but he wants to see you
in his office beforehand.

388
00:32:32.448 --> 00:32:36.009
What?
Oh. Oh, guys?

389
00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:39.077
I think I can already
feel his foot up my ass.

390
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:42.983
All right, people,
let's get right to it.

391
00:32:45.094 --> 00:32:46.618
You've all heard me warn you
about the problems

392
00:32:46.696 --> 00:32:48.789
of the average start-up company.

393
00:32:48.864 --> 00:32:52.231
Well, it seems that we've been on
the losing end this week.

394
00:32:52.301 --> 00:32:54.565
I had five deals
fall through,

395
00:32:54.637 --> 00:32:57.128
including R.S.B.
Financial.

396
00:32:57.206 --> 00:32:59.197
That's...

397
00:32:59.275 --> 00:33:01.903
That's Trevor's account.
He said it was a sure thing.

398
00:33:01.978 --> 00:33:04.003
Well,
he was wrong.

399
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.911
And unfortunately,
Mr. Callahan felt

400
00:33:05.982 --> 00:33:08.246
like he had to send
a message on this one.

401
00:33:08.317 --> 00:33:10.410
We've had to let
Trevor go.

402
00:33:13.456 --> 00:33:15.788
So I suggest that we all
get back to work, hmm?

403
00:33:17.593 --> 00:33:20.619
Doesn't that seem
a little harsh?

404
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.191
Yes.

405
00:33:26.268 --> 00:33:28.862
- So what actually happened?
- Excuse me?

406
00:33:28.938 --> 00:33:31.133
Well, if Trevorthought

407
00:33:31.207 --> 00:33:33.539
it was a sure thing,
why'd the deal fall apart?

408
00:33:36.245 --> 00:33:38.440
Come on, Bristol.

409
00:33:38.514 --> 00:33:40.880
You had Trevor's job once,

410
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.145
and you know
how hard it is.

411
00:33:43.219 --> 00:33:46.052
Yeah, and I worked my ass off,
I didn't make mistakes

412
00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:48.283
and I got rewarded.

413
00:33:48.357 --> 00:33:50.689
Why? 'Cause
the Strike Line deal

414
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.160
fell on your lap?

415
00:33:53.229 --> 00:33:56.790
You were supposed to close
the R.S.B. Deal, not Trevor.

416
00:33:58.267 --> 00:34:00.667
And you think you know
something we don't?

417
00:34:00.736 --> 00:34:03.466
What I know

418
00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:05.871
is Mr. Callahan pays me
to be the judge of you people,

419
00:34:05.941 --> 00:34:08.205
and right now my judgment is telling me
that you'd much rather be

420
00:34:08.277 --> 00:34:10.404
at home watching "Oprah"
with yourfriend

421
00:34:10.479 --> 00:34:12.310
than working
on this team any longer.

422
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:14.508
Congratulations, Nick.
You're fired too.

423
00:34:15.618 --> 00:34:17.609
Anyone else?

424
00:34:24.293 --> 00:34:27.126
I love you, man,
but this was not your problem.

425
00:34:27.196 --> 00:34:29.391
Fuck that.

426
00:34:29.465 --> 00:34:32.332
If it wasn't for us, Bristol wouldn't
have been promoted in the first place.

427
00:34:32.401 --> 00:34:34.426
I'm not taking
orders from him.

428
00:34:34.503 --> 00:34:35.936
Nick, you worked your ass
off at this place.

429
00:34:36.005 --> 00:34:37.472
You put your blood
into this place, man.

430
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.008
Yeah, I put my blood into this place,
and Bristol's the one who gets promoted.

431
00:34:40.076 --> 00:34:43.136
Nick, that's business.
You taught me that.

432
00:34:43.212 --> 00:34:46.272
Now, look.
Go tell Bristol you're sorry.

433
00:34:46.348 --> 00:34:48.748
Tell him you're still having
side effects from the accident.

434
00:34:51.921 --> 00:34:55.721
Only side effect I'm having is knowing
life is way too short forthis.

435
00:34:58.461 --> 00:35:00.395
What is this,
a guy thing?

436
00:35:00.463 --> 00:35:02.761
Trevor gets canned, so you just jump off
the bridge with him?

437
00:35:02.832 --> 00:35:05.665
Look, I was never gonna move up with
Bristol as my supervisor anyway.

438
00:35:05.734 --> 00:35:07.463
Ever since the guy got promoted,

439
00:35:07.536 --> 00:35:09.663
he's just been looking
for an excuse to fire me.

440
00:35:09.738 --> 00:35:12.332
- Well, you didn't have to give him one.
- You know what? The truth is,

441
00:35:12.408 --> 00:35:14.501
he's the weak link.
He's ruined the whole company,

442
00:35:14.577 --> 00:35:16.636
and everybody knows it.
And you know what?

443
00:35:16.712 --> 00:35:19.180
I am better off
just getting out from under him.

444
00:35:19.248 --> 00:35:21.614
No, Nick.
You're better off with a job.

445
00:35:21.684 --> 00:35:23.709
I told you,
I'll find another one.

446
00:35:23.786 --> 00:35:26.516
A better one.
We'll all be okay.

447
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:30.855
You also told me to stay here and not go
to New York, because that would be okay.

448
00:35:30.926 --> 00:35:32.860
I'm sorry,

449
00:35:32.928 --> 00:35:36.227
and ljust can't
forget what we lost in that accident.

450
00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.078
Hon?

451
00:35:53.949 --> 00:35:55.917
Hey.

452
00:35:57.153 --> 00:36:00.452
Hey, it will be.

453
00:36:00.523 --> 00:36:02.718
It just takes time.

454
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:05.726
Nick, it's been a year.

455
00:36:05.794 --> 00:36:10.060
I spend my days cataloguing other
people's photo shoots for minimum wage.

456
00:36:10.132 --> 00:36:13.533
I have half a portfolio
and no time to finish it, and now...

457
00:36:13.602 --> 00:36:16.332
Well, now I have to get
another job so that we can pay our rent.

458
00:36:16.405 --> 00:36:18.373
Excuse me.

459
00:36:24.914 --> 00:36:27.712
Hey. Hey.

460
00:36:27.783 --> 00:36:30.343
Hey.

461
00:36:30.419 --> 00:36:33.684
It's about the big picture.
I finally see it now.

462
00:36:33.756 --> 00:36:37.385
All that other stuff
is just... just stuff.

463
00:36:37.459 --> 00:36:39.757
Look, the only thing
that is important

464
00:36:39.828 --> 00:36:42.820
is that we have
each other.

465
00:36:42.898 --> 00:36:45.458
That's all that counts.

466
00:36:48.704 --> 00:36:50.968
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

467
00:37:02.985 --> 00:37:06.443
Mm. Maybe I'll be
a technical copyeditor.

468
00:37:16.265 --> 00:37:20.429
Is that Bristol?
Jerk.

469
00:37:43.525 --> 00:37:45.891
Come on.

470
00:37:52.468 --> 00:37:54.436
Nick?

471
00:37:55.871 --> 00:37:57.839
Nick.

472
00:38:05.748 --> 00:38:07.943
- Perfect shot.
- Ah! Great.

473
00:38:08.017 --> 00:38:09.575
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

474
00:38:09.652 --> 00:38:11.279
- Isn't that great?
- You look so good.

475
00:38:11.353 --> 00:38:14.948
Nice.
So, what do you think?

476
00:38:15.024 --> 00:38:17.322
- Hmm?
- The ring, honey. Isn't it beautiful?

477
00:38:17.393 --> 00:38:20.021
Can you believe
I picked that thing out myself?

478
00:38:20.095 --> 00:38:22.188
- It's fantastic.
- Ooh.

479
00:38:22.264 --> 00:38:24.323
Yeah.
Sure, it's beautiful.

480
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.891
We're thinking
next October.

481
00:38:26.969 --> 00:38:29.733
Oh, how many people
are you gonna invite?

482
00:38:29.805 --> 00:38:33.366
You know, maybe 50.
Just the important ones.

483
00:38:33.442 --> 00:38:35.205
- Mmm.
- Ah. Right.

484
00:38:35.277 --> 00:38:38.110
- Dave Bristol.
- What?

485
00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.171
From your office?

486
00:38:40.249 --> 00:38:43.912
Yeah, right. Like I'd
invite that tool.

487
00:38:43.986 --> 00:38:47.217
Looks like I'm out.
Anyone else need more?

488
00:38:47.289 --> 00:38:49.450
Oh, no, honey.

489
00:38:53.529 --> 00:38:55.793
Bristol,
merry Christmas.

490
00:38:55.864 --> 00:38:58.162
Merry Christmas.

491
00:39:10.446 --> 00:39:12.676
Oh, come on, Nick!

492
00:39:12.748 --> 00:39:15.581
- What are you doing?
- Bristol, I'm sorry, man.

493
00:39:15.651 --> 00:39:18.017
What a klutz.
Can l...

494
00:39:18.087 --> 00:39:20.521
Nice.
That's really nice.

495
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:22.181
Oh, man.

496
00:39:22.257 --> 00:39:23.884
Oh, that's embarrassing,

497
00:39:23.959 --> 00:39:25.358
so embarrassing.

498
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.588
No way.

499
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.931
Hey, Nick.

500
00:42:24.006 --> 00:42:25.997
I know you need
those spreadsheets.

501
00:42:26.074 --> 00:42:28.269
I'm just waiting on some numbers
from the clients.

502
00:42:31.813 --> 00:42:34.213
Holy shit.

503
00:42:34.283 --> 00:42:36.808
I'm the vice president.

504
00:42:36.885 --> 00:42:40.719
Uh, yeah, of course.
I'm not trying to make excuses.

505
00:42:40.789 --> 00:42:43.121
I pulled the Strike Line
deal, not you.

506
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:45.751
I'm sorry.
I'm just not following this.

507
00:42:47.195 --> 00:42:49.129
Where's Trevor?

508
00:42:49.197 --> 00:42:53.133
At some off-site client meeting.
He said you knew about it.

509
00:42:53.201 --> 00:42:56.728
Oh, yeah, right.
Thanks.

510
00:42:56.805 --> 00:43:01.105
Oh, and Bristol, clean up that desk.
It's a mess.

511
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.609
I swear, if I get
one more S.E.C. Notice,

512
00:43:10.686 --> 00:43:14.588
I am gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

513
00:43:14.656 --> 00:43:16.590
Well, I hear
the weather's nice there.

514
00:43:16.658 --> 00:43:20.389
Yeah, I guess.
So how you feelin'?

515
00:43:20.462 --> 00:43:23.920
Oh, betterthan ever.

516
00:43:23.999 --> 00:43:26.263
Listen, I'm having dinner
with a potential investor.

517
00:43:26.335 --> 00:43:28.326
He's a big one.
We need him.

518
00:43:28.403 --> 00:43:30.371
You know what they say
about start-ups.

519
00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.474
I want you riding shotgun.

520
00:43:33.542 --> 00:43:36.136
I wouldn't miss it
forthe world, Mr. Callahan.

521
00:43:36.211 --> 00:43:39.374
"Mr. Callahan."
That's cute.

522
00:44:16.918 --> 00:44:19.944
The weather burns in you

523
00:44:20.022 --> 00:44:23.253
I can't predict the rain

524
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.551
The silence falls...

525
00:44:27.629 --> 00:44:29.722
"Pacific Avenue."

526
00:44:29.798 --> 00:44:32.494
You've reached Julie Miller
Photography.

527
00:44:32.567 --> 00:44:34.797
I can't take your call,
so please leave a message,

528
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.703
including your phone number
and the date you'd like to book.

529
00:44:37.773 --> 00:44:39.707
Thank you.

530
00:44:39.775 --> 00:44:42.744
Well, hello there,
Julie Miller Photography.

531
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:45.109
It's Nick Larson calling,

532
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.139
and the date I would like to book is for
tonight after my client meeting,

533
00:44:49.217 --> 00:44:51.276
which hopefully won't
last too long.

534
00:44:51.353 --> 00:44:53.150
So why don't you
give me a call back

535
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:55.485
and let me know if that works
foryour schedule?

536
00:44:55.557 --> 00:44:59.049
Unless of course I see you at home
first. All right. I love you, babe.

537
00:45:07.436 --> 00:45:09.404
Honey, I'm home!

538
00:45:14.076 --> 00:45:16.010
No.

539
00:45:25.654 --> 00:45:27.622
What?

540
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.866
Hey, Nick, it's Mom.
I hope you're okay.

541
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.170
I'd say so.

542
00:45:47.242 --> 00:45:50.302
Call me. I haven't seen you for weeks.
I know you're busy,

543
00:45:50.378 --> 00:45:53.006
but let me know
how you are.

544
00:46:09.064 --> 00:46:12.261
Atoast... to
successful partnerships.

545
00:46:12.334 --> 00:46:14.268
- Salud.
- Salud.

546
00:46:14.336 --> 00:46:17.362
Your daughter is
charming and beautiful.

547
00:46:18.807 --> 00:46:21.275
Thank you.

548
00:46:21.343 --> 00:46:24.437
Mm. And what
about you, Nick?

549
00:46:24.513 --> 00:46:26.879
Do you have
family here?

550
00:46:26.948 --> 00:46:29.109
Uh, just my mom.
Yeah.

551
00:46:29.184 --> 00:46:32.210
My, uh... my father moved away
when I was a kid.

552
00:46:32.287 --> 00:46:34.653
Ah. I am very sorry
to hearthat.

553
00:46:36.424 --> 00:46:38.551
Well, it seems that
you turned out all right.

554
00:46:38.627 --> 00:46:41.152
You have certainly made
an impression on your boss.

555
00:46:41.229 --> 00:46:42.753
Oh, well...

556
00:46:42.831 --> 00:46:44.992
Nick's had a bit of
a magic touch lately.

557
00:46:45.066 --> 00:46:48.832
Well, ljust try to keep
things simple, you know?

558
00:46:48.904 --> 00:46:51.372
Know what you want
and try to make that happen.

559
00:46:51.439 --> 00:46:53.964
And if that doesn't work out,
you steal the file

560
00:46:54.042 --> 00:46:56.340
from the guy sitting next to you
and hope that one's a winner.

561
00:46:57.979 --> 00:47:01.540
All right, Nick.
Well, let's get serious for a minute

562
00:47:01.616 --> 00:47:05.313
and tell Mr. Fuentes
about the new numbers.

563
00:47:07.055 --> 00:47:10.024
Now? Oh, we're having
such a good time.

564
00:47:10.091 --> 00:47:12.685
The new numbers,
Nick.

565
00:47:12.761 --> 00:47:16.026
We're about to ask
Mr. Fuentes for a large amount of money.

566
00:47:16.097 --> 00:47:18.622
You have to dazzle
the wallet out of his pocket

567
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.362
and make it dance
on the table.

568
00:47:21.436 --> 00:47:24.837
No, really, Ron, you take the glory.
This is your baby.

569
00:47:26.174 --> 00:47:28.369
The numbers, Nick.

570
00:47:31.112 --> 00:47:34.275
Well, what we're, uh...
we're really talking about

571
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:36.783
is, uh...

572
00:47:40.488 --> 00:47:43.582
the next generation of
hand-held operating systems.

573
00:47:47.095 --> 00:47:50.030
Our software capitalizes
on optical internet protocol,

574
00:47:50.098 --> 00:47:52.623
using light-wave
architectures for processing

575
00:47:52.701 --> 00:47:55.602
so that it will send and receive data
over multiple wavelengths.

576
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.831
Our system can be commercialized
within six months,

577
00:47:57.906 --> 00:48:00.466
and with a working beta product
and your company's backing,

578
00:48:00.542 --> 00:48:04.069
we can expect to sign one,
maybe two of the incumbents.

579
00:48:04.145 --> 00:48:06.477
Then we'll minimize
ourfront-end expenditures

580
00:48:06.548 --> 00:48:08.482
by outsourcing to
a flex manufacturer in China.

581
00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:10.711
If we're right,
our product margins will add

582
00:48:10.785 --> 00:48:14.380
500 basis points to your company's
gross margins within 12 months.

583
00:48:14.456 --> 00:48:18.222
Bottom line, if we achieve one-third
of the unit sales forecasted,

584
00:48:18.293 --> 00:48:20.261
we'll double your
company's cash flow.

585
00:48:39.514 --> 00:48:41.482
All right.

586
00:48:44.953 --> 00:48:47.285
Hey.
How's it going?

587
00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:49.721
I'm about to pull out
my hair, I'm so bored.

588
00:48:51.092 --> 00:48:54.084
Yeah, it's, uh...

589
00:48:54.162 --> 00:48:56.494
sorry for all
the technobabble.

590
00:48:56.564 --> 00:49:00.330
Actually, you know,
that's the part that got me hot.

591
00:49:00.402 --> 00:49:01.562
Grace?

592
00:49:02.671 --> 00:49:04.104
Oh Jesus.

593
00:49:04.172 --> 00:49:06.265
What are you doing?

594
00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:08.468
Baby, it's been
a week.

595
00:49:08.543 --> 00:49:10.704
What, you want me
to beg for it?

596
00:49:12.981 --> 00:49:16.644
Whoa. Hey. Hey hey hey.
We're in a restaurant.

597
00:49:17.819 --> 00:49:20.515
When has that ever
stopped you before?

598
00:49:29.898 --> 00:49:32.162
Oh fuck.

599
00:49:32.233 --> 00:49:34.201
Hold up.
Your dad's right outside.

600
00:49:34.269 --> 00:49:36.203
I don't care about that,
and neither does he.

601
00:49:36.271 --> 00:49:39.035
Besides, I'll just tell him
to give you another raise.

602
00:49:43.745 --> 00:49:45.713
Oh, Nick!

603
00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:58.225
- I want you, Nick.
- I hearyou.

604
00:50:08.169 --> 00:50:08.396
Yeah.

605
00:50:30.425 --> 00:50:32.586
Yeah!

606
00:50:52.047 --> 00:50:53.912
Oh my God.
What are you doing?

607
00:50:53.982 --> 00:50:56.246
Let's have some fun here.

608
00:50:56.317 --> 00:50:59.013
Smile, baby.

609
00:50:59.087 --> 00:51:01.555
Uh-uh. Hey...

610
00:51:01.623 --> 00:51:04.057
- I'll be in touch.
- You're most welcome.

611
00:51:06.728 --> 00:51:09.663
You did great, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

612
00:51:09.731 --> 00:51:12.222
Yeah, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

613
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:25.007
Here I am
to let you know

614
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.846
Take it back
and let it slow

615
00:51:28.917 --> 00:51:32.182
Take it back
and let it slow

616
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.220
Lust away from
all that ends

617
00:51:39.294 --> 00:51:42.730
Try to keep
all amends

618
00:51:42.797 --> 00:51:46.255
Try to keep all amends

619
00:51:49.704 --> 00:51:54.732
Your home

620
00:51:54.809 --> 00:51:57.107
You hardly know it...

621
00:52:12.894 --> 00:52:14.486
- Oh! Jesus!
- Where were you?

622
00:52:14.562 --> 00:52:16.029
I was waiting fortwo hours.

623
00:52:16.097 --> 00:52:18.327
Trevor, settle down, man.
I was at dinner with Callahan.

624
00:52:18.399 --> 00:52:20.333
What? I told you,
we need to talk.

625
00:52:20.401 --> 00:52:23.199
All right.
What's going on?

626
00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:26.934
I've got a problem with
one of my investors.

627
00:52:27.008 --> 00:52:29.568
- Who?
- Malcolm.

628
00:52:31.146 --> 00:52:34.172
- "Malcolm"?
- Are you playing with me?

629
00:52:34.249 --> 00:52:38.015
Malcolm, from the club.
We took his money. You closed the deal.

630
00:52:38.086 --> 00:52:40.247
- Is your head fucked? Come on!
- Malcolm, of course.

631
00:52:40.321 --> 00:52:41.754
Yes. What's up?
What's going on?

632
00:52:41.823 --> 00:52:45.281
The money...
h-he-he... he wants it back.

633
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.988
- All right. How much?
- All of it.

634
00:52:48.062 --> 00:52:50.622
- 250 grand.
- "250 grand"?

635
00:52:53.968 --> 00:52:57.665
- Did he do that to you?
- It was one of his guys, as a reminder.

636
00:52:57.739 --> 00:52:59.969
Just listen.
Listen to me, Nick.

637
00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:01.906
You've got to make
this happen, man, okay?

638
00:53:01.976 --> 00:53:03.637
'Cause I can't mess
around with this guy.

639
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:05.201
I-I-I can't make him
wait anymore.

640
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.044
Hey, Trevor...

641
00:53:08.116 --> 00:53:10.676
I'll talk to Ron.
I'll take care of it.

642
00:53:10.752 --> 00:53:13.846
It's no big deal.
All right?

643
00:53:13.922 --> 00:53:16.584
- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- All right, okay.

644
00:53:16.658 --> 00:53:20.025
- I owe you my life, man.
- No no. Dude.

645
00:53:21.129 --> 00:53:23.154
- It's all right.
- All right.

646
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.464
Hey.

647
00:53:27.535 --> 00:53:30.527
You, uh... you talk
to Julie lately?

648
00:53:30.605 --> 00:53:33.335
No. Not in a while.
Why?

649
00:53:33.408 --> 00:53:35.569
I'm having a hard time
tracking her down.

650
00:53:35.643 --> 00:53:37.167
Dude.

651
00:53:37.245 --> 00:53:40.043
You told me last time,
you're done with her, right?

652
00:53:43.017 --> 00:53:45.178
See you later.

653
00:54:26.594 --> 00:54:28.824
Ron.
How's it going, man?

654
00:54:28.896 --> 00:54:31.831
For shit.
Fuentes bailed.

655
00:54:31.899 --> 00:54:33.867
What? You got to
be kidding me.

656
00:54:33.935 --> 00:54:35.960
After last night
I thought we had him.

657
00:54:36.037 --> 00:54:38.164
Yeah, well, fuck him.
His mistake.

658
00:54:38.239 --> 00:54:40.571
Oh, Jesus!

659
00:54:43.511 --> 00:54:45.536
Listen, I hate to
pile on, man, but, um,

660
00:54:45.613 --> 00:54:48.275
it seems we have a problem
with one of our investors.

661
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:50.544
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:50.618 --> 00:54:53.314
Guy Trevor brought in back
in July, gave us 250 grand?

663
00:54:53.388 --> 00:54:57.017
Anyway, he says, uh...
he says he wants it back.

664
00:54:59.661 --> 00:55:02.824
- That's it?
- Yeah.

665
00:55:02.897 --> 00:55:04.831
That's pocket change.

666
00:55:04.899 --> 00:55:07.868
Why don't you just go get the checkbook
off my desk and write it yourself?

667
00:55:07.935 --> 00:55:11.996
Ron, thank you so much, man.
I knew you'd understand.

668
00:55:12.073 --> 00:55:14.564
Why don't you write
a few more while you're at it?

669
00:55:14.642 --> 00:55:17.167
I mean, just go down to the corner
and pass 'em out with milk and cookies.

670
00:55:17.245 --> 00:55:19.008
I mean, if you really
want to give some money away.

671
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.674
It's not like that, man.

672
00:55:21.749 --> 00:55:24.240
Nick,
we have contracts

673
00:55:24.319 --> 00:55:26.378
that specify how and when
people get paid back.

674
00:55:26.454 --> 00:55:29.890
I know. I understand.
Look, it is a one-time thing.

675
00:55:29.957 --> 00:55:32.152
I'll make it up to you
on the next deal.

676
00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:37.961
I don't get it. Were you asleep for our
entire conversation yesterday?

677
00:55:40.268 --> 00:55:42.259
Which... which one?

678
00:55:42.337 --> 00:55:44.703
The one where
I told you we're broke.

679
00:55:46.641 --> 00:55:50.133
- What?
- Nick, the money is gone.

680
00:55:50.211 --> 00:55:52.441
No matter how many times
we go over it, it is gone.

681
00:55:52.513 --> 00:55:55.505
We've spent it...
everything we had and more.

682
00:55:57.151 --> 00:56:00.211
- Ron, that's not possible.
- You wouldn't think so,

683
00:56:00.288 --> 00:56:02.813
but somehow we managed
to pull it off.

684
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.428
What about
the Strike Line deal?

685
00:56:11.699 --> 00:56:14.668
Nick, you're
a good salesman.

686
00:56:14.736 --> 00:56:17.432
You've done a lot of
great things for my company.

687
00:56:17.505 --> 00:56:19.939
I'm glad I made you v.P.,

688
00:56:20.007 --> 00:56:23.033
but let's face it...
you blew it on that one.

689
00:56:27.315 --> 00:56:29.306
What are you
talking about?

690
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:32.576
You approached them
during Christmas.

691
00:56:32.653 --> 00:56:34.587
We weren't ready.

692
00:56:34.655 --> 00:56:37.351
No matter how you look at it, Nick, you
scared them off. That's the truth.

693
00:56:41.095 --> 00:56:43.120
I didn't make
the Strike Line deal.

694
00:56:43.197 --> 00:56:45.893
Hell, you know,
if... if we had just nailed that deal,

695
00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:48.595
we'd actually probably have some
working software right now

696
00:56:48.669 --> 00:56:51.069
instead of this
pile of garbage.

697
00:56:58.679 --> 00:57:01.409
Hey.

698
00:57:01.482 --> 00:57:04.576
- So what's the story?
- Still working on it.

699
00:57:04.652 --> 00:57:08.645
Nick, come on, man.
I'm meeting Malcolm tonight.

700
00:57:08.723 --> 00:57:12.215
Hey. I'm gonna
take care of it.

701
00:57:15.229 --> 00:57:17.754
Okay.

702
00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.834
Julie.
Hey, it's, uh...

703
00:57:25.907 --> 00:57:28.068
it's me, Nick, again.

704
00:57:28.142 --> 00:57:30.235
Um...

705
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:33.838
listen, I know that
there's some stuff between us,

706
00:57:33.915 --> 00:57:37.146
and you're obviously
not calling me back, but...

707
00:57:37.218 --> 00:57:40.187
I'd really like
to talk to you.

708
00:57:40.254 --> 00:57:43.052
Happy belated birthday,
and, uh...

709
00:57:44.659 --> 00:57:46.627
I miss you.

710
00:58:07.915 --> 00:58:10.179
- Hello?
- Nick. Finally.

711
00:58:10.251 --> 00:58:12.412
- Oh, hey, Mom.
- How are you?

712
00:58:12.487 --> 00:58:15.217
Fine, uh, what's up?

713
00:58:15.289 --> 00:58:18.816
I've spoken to yourfather's doctor.
He'd like to see you.

714
00:58:18.893 --> 00:58:20.986
Will you talk to him?

715
00:58:22.096 --> 00:58:24.496
Why? What...
what do you mean?

716
00:58:24.565 --> 00:58:28.262
I'm concerned about you.
I really want to come and see you.

717
00:58:28.336 --> 00:58:31.703
- No no, I'm good, Mom. I'm fine.
- No, I really...

718
00:58:31.772 --> 00:58:33.433
Hey, listen, I got to go, okay?
I'll call you later.

719
00:58:33.508 --> 00:58:35.442
- Nick...
- I love you.

720
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:37.478
Bye.

721
00:58:51.993 --> 00:58:54.928
Let me see.
Oh, looks good, huh?

722
01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.908
Julie.

723
01:00:17.545 --> 01:00:20.013
Hey.

724
01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:22.140
Wow, I...

725
01:00:22.216 --> 01:00:24.411
hardly recognized you,
you look so different.

726
01:00:24.485 --> 01:00:26.885
Uh, thanks,
I think.

727
01:00:26.954 --> 01:00:29.718
No, I mean,
you look beautiful.

728
01:00:31.993 --> 01:00:34.461
Um, I left you a bunch of messages.
Did you get 'em?

729
01:00:34.528 --> 01:00:37.053
Yeah, I got 'em.

730
01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:39.122
Okay.

731
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.191
I'm sorry.
I know I...

732
01:00:41.268 --> 01:00:44.726
I got a little carried away.
Ljust really wanted to talk to you.

733
01:00:44.805 --> 01:00:48.468
Well, I'm standing here,
so go ahead.

734
01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:52.672
Um...
What are you doing?

735
01:00:52.747 --> 01:00:56.012
- I'm working.
- At a club?

736
01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:59.143
Yeah, at a club.
I'm shooting a fashion show.

737
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.088
Well, that's cool.
Who hooked that up?

738
01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:07.150
Christopher. He introduced
me to a few people and it just took off.

739
01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:09.162
Wow.
Who's Christopher?

740
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.925
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

741
01:01:10.998 --> 01:01:13.057
- You call me?
- I did.

742
01:01:13.134 --> 01:01:15.796
- And who's this?
- Oh, uh, Nick.

743
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:18.031
Old friend.
We're just catching up.

744
01:01:18.105 --> 01:01:21.802
Nick, she's the greatest, isn't she?
She's gonna be a star, aren't you, baby?

745
01:01:21.876 --> 01:01:23.810
Listen, I'm gonna
get another drink.

746
01:01:23.878 --> 01:01:25.311
- Can I get you something?
- Sure.

747
01:01:25.379 --> 01:01:27.506
- Nick?
- No, I'm good.

748
01:01:27.581 --> 01:01:29.071
All right

749
01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:36.823
Julie.
Julie.

750
01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:39.257
Listen,

751
01:01:39.326 --> 01:01:41.453
I know some stuff
went wrong with us,

752
01:01:41.529 --> 01:01:45.465
but you have to believe me, I never
meant for it to end up like this.

753
01:01:45.533 --> 01:01:47.524
Oh, cut the shit, Nick.
You know what?

754
01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:49.432
You got everything exactly
the way you wanted it,

755
01:01:49.503 --> 01:01:51.061
so don't start caring
about me now.

756
01:01:51.138 --> 01:01:53.629
I am telling you,
whatever I said,

757
01:01:53.708 --> 01:01:55.801
whatever I did, whatever...
happened between us,

758
01:01:55.876 --> 01:01:58.140
just... just wipe it
out of your head.

759
01:01:58.212 --> 01:02:01.739
Don't you get it?
I already have.

760
01:02:01.816 --> 01:02:05.149
You know, and all yourtalk
about your job

761
01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:07.449
and my career,
the future,

762
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:10.547
that's all it was,
Nick... talk.

763
01:02:10.624 --> 01:02:12.421
And now
I'm my own boss,

764
01:02:12.493 --> 01:02:15.951
and forthe first time
I'm doing exactly what I want to do.

765
01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:18.123
No, you're not.

766
01:02:20.034 --> 01:02:22.229
I know what you want,
and it's not this.

767
01:02:23.437 --> 01:02:25.598
- Things change.
- Not us.

768
01:02:25.673 --> 01:02:29.200
Julie, we can
start over.

769
01:02:30.578 --> 01:02:32.136
Just give me a chance.

770
01:02:37.017 --> 01:02:40.180
- That's her, isn't it?
- Who?

771
01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:44.725
Grace.

772
01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.951
Julie, no.

773
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:51.896
You are the only thing
in this world that matters to me.

774
01:02:51.966 --> 01:02:54.833
I don't know how
I lost sight of that.

775
01:02:54.902 --> 01:02:57.029
I can fix this.

776
01:02:57.104 --> 01:02:59.470
I promise you I will.

777
01:03:00.574 --> 01:03:02.974
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

778
01:03:07.014 --> 01:03:08.982
Hey...

779
01:03:17.925 --> 01:03:19.984
Nick.
Oh, thank God.

780
01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.994
See, I told you
he'd show.

781
01:03:22.062 --> 01:03:23.529
I'm really glad
you could make it, Nick.

782
01:03:23.597 --> 01:03:25.258
- Malcolm, I assume.
- Yeah,

783
01:03:25.332 --> 01:03:28.324
- good to meet you face to face finally.
- And you.

784
01:03:28.402 --> 01:03:30.962
This is Wayne.
He owns half the club with me.

785
01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:33.632
Wayne?
Nick.

786
01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:35.698
Good luck.

787
01:03:38.712 --> 01:03:40.680
Have a seat.

788
01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:49.356
All right.

789
01:03:51.826 --> 01:03:55.159
Malcolm, this space
is fantastic.

790
01:03:55.229 --> 01:03:57.595
Thank you very much.

791
01:04:02.036 --> 01:04:05.437
Here we go.
A little black tea

792
01:04:05.506 --> 01:04:08.031
with ginseng
and mango.

793
01:04:08.108 --> 01:04:10.235
We call it
Chinese rocket fuel.

794
01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:12.245
Keeps you sharp,
mind and body.

795
01:04:12.313 --> 01:04:14.281
It seems to be
working foryou.

796
01:04:16.217 --> 01:04:18.151
I know why
you're here.

797
01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:20.847
You want to renegotiate
your contract.

798
01:04:21.889 --> 01:04:23.618
Yes.

799
01:04:23.691 --> 01:04:26.091
Yourfriend made
a lot of promises.

800
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.856
Said he could get me in on the ground
floor, triple my money with some sort of

801
01:04:28.929 --> 01:04:31.625
turbocharged
super-phone software,

802
01:04:31.699 --> 01:04:34.293
and I'm no expert,
but it sounded pretty good.

803
01:04:34.368 --> 01:04:36.598
And it is, Malcolm.

804
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:38.604
That's all true.

805
01:04:38.672 --> 01:04:42.108
It is an excellent product. I'm sure
your investment will see a great return.

806
01:04:42.176 --> 01:04:45.304
Malcolm, I'm not sure what
it is you're looking for,

807
01:04:45.379 --> 01:04:48.212
but if you look at your contract, you'll
see we're well within ourtimeline.

808
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:51.877
Okay,
but at some time,

809
01:04:51.952 --> 01:04:55.149
I need to feel like there's some sort
of progress going on.

810
01:04:55.222 --> 01:04:59.056
Okay. Well, how can I
help you feel like that?

811
01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:02.829
See, we're part
of an organization.

812
01:05:02.897 --> 01:05:05.627
There's a chain of command.
It's the way things are done.

813
01:05:05.699 --> 01:05:08.031
Which is why we sign
contracts that specify

814
01:05:08.102 --> 01:05:10.229
how and when people
are paid back.

815
01:05:10.304 --> 01:05:13.933
You're a businessman.
You know how the whole thing works.

816
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:22.611
Have you ever wished you could look
into the future?

817
01:05:24.518 --> 01:05:27.783
The Chinese believe it's possible just
by looking at a pattern of tea leaves.

818
01:05:27.855 --> 01:05:31.018
So... the question is,

819
01:05:32.293 --> 01:05:34.727
do I see a waterfall

820
01:05:34.795 --> 01:05:37.263
dripping with all the money
you guys are gonna make me?

821
01:05:38.465 --> 01:05:40.763
Or, uh,

822
01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:43.496
do I see a little bonfire
cooking as everything

823
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:45.561
- I gave you goes up in smoke?
- That's not it, Malcolm.

824
01:05:45.639 --> 01:05:47.300
Well, I'm dying foryou
to prove me otherwise.

825
01:05:48.709 --> 01:05:50.836
I think I can help.

826
01:05:50.911 --> 01:05:53.141
Because of your
relationship with Trevor

827
01:05:53.213 --> 01:05:55.147
and my confidence
in this product,

828
01:05:55.215 --> 01:05:57.809
I've written you
a personal check for 10%.

829
01:06:01.822 --> 01:06:05.553
25 thousand
out of 250?

830
01:06:07.594 --> 01:06:09.824
It's a Band-Aid
until your...

831
01:06:09.897 --> 01:06:12.127
your investment
sees its return.

832
01:06:15.669 --> 01:06:18.137
Band-Aids.
I love Band-Aids.

833
01:06:18.205 --> 01:06:20.435
Now, you see?
I told you,

834
01:06:20.507 --> 01:06:24.603
Nick's on this now,
and he's gonna take care of everything.

835
01:06:31.318 --> 01:06:33.343
Well, it's better
than nothing,

836
01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.411
which is all I've gotten
from you so far.

837
01:06:36.924 --> 01:06:40.382
So, maybe it's time we cut out
the middlemen, right?

838
01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:49.067
No!

839
01:06:55.442 --> 01:06:58.275
Get him out.

840
01:07:09.723 --> 01:07:11.714
Nick?

841
01:07:12.793 --> 01:07:16.024
- No!
- What?

842
01:07:16.096 --> 01:07:18.030
Stay in here, okay?

843
01:07:18.098 --> 01:07:20.259
Come on, move, move!
Get out!

844
01:07:20.334 --> 01:07:22.768
Shit!
Get out! Now!

845
01:07:22.836 --> 01:07:25.396
Fuck! Fuck!

846
01:07:25.472 --> 01:07:27.463
Julie?

847
01:07:30.511 --> 01:07:32.445
Julie?

848
01:07:32.513 --> 01:07:34.481
- Nick?
- No!

849
01:07:35.749 --> 01:07:37.842
No, Julie!
Fuck!

850
01:07:37.918 --> 01:07:40.443
- Oh, Julie! Oh, my God!
- What's happening?

851
01:07:40.521 --> 01:07:42.614
Shh. Shh.
I love you, baby.

852
01:07:42.689 --> 01:07:45.123
I love you.
You're okay, okay?

853
01:07:45.192 --> 01:07:47.558
Here. Don't look.
Here here. Hey, look at me.

854
01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:50.927
Look at me, look at me.
Everything's fine. Okay?

855
01:07:50.998 --> 01:07:52.863
You're okay. Shh.

856
01:07:52.933 --> 01:07:54.958
Breathe.

857
01:07:56.904 --> 01:07:59.065
Come on!

858
01:07:59.139 --> 01:08:01.198
Breathe.
Just breathe.

859
01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:03.072
All right.
All right.

860
01:08:39.012 --> 01:08:41.003
Oh, Grace!

861
01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:48.684
Oh, God.

862
01:08:51.558 --> 01:08:52.991
Found something that
would wake you up.

863
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.994
What the fuck?

864
01:08:55.062 --> 01:08:58.031
Relax.
You're enjoying it.

865
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.000
Your shit's on the floor.

866
01:09:10.644 --> 01:09:13.738
You want something
to drink?

867
01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:23.014
Who are you?

868
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.183
Huh?

869
01:09:25.259 --> 01:09:28.319
How did I get here?

870
01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:34.359
You are
so bloody cute.

871
01:09:37.337 --> 01:09:40.431
- Answerthe question.
- Get your hands off of me.

872
01:09:43.777 --> 01:09:47.178
You don't remember me?
We met at the club.

873
01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:49.841
Malcolm and I
are partners.

874
01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:53.409
On everything.
Which means I own half your ass.

875
01:09:59.793 --> 01:10:02.921
I understand you
owe us $250,000.

876
01:10:03.997 --> 01:10:06.022
If you hadda behaved yourself,

877
01:10:06.099 --> 01:10:09.193
I could've persuaded Malcolm
into reducing your bill,

878
01:10:09.269 --> 01:10:12.568
but now you're not going anywhere
until he gets here.

879
01:10:12.639 --> 01:10:14.573
Don't you get it?

880
01:10:30.624 --> 01:10:33.787
I'm sure your girlfriend
and Trevor would agree.

881
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.794
Fuck you.

882
01:10:42.936 --> 01:10:45.530
I really screwed things up, Mom.

883
01:10:45.606 --> 01:10:49.201
I tried so hard
to fix everything, to just...

884
01:10:49.276 --> 01:10:52.245
make things right, and every time I do
I make it so much worse.

885
01:10:53.614 --> 01:10:55.775
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

886
01:10:55.849 --> 01:10:58.579
Don't. You remind me
of yourfather when you talk like that.

887
01:10:58.652 --> 01:11:01.780
- Why?
- You try to control everything.

888
01:11:05.626 --> 01:11:08.220
Mom, I want
to talk to Dad.

889
01:11:08.295 --> 01:11:10.889
No, you can...
you can't, okay?

890
01:11:10.964 --> 01:11:13.694
You don't understand.
It's really important.

891
01:11:13.767 --> 01:11:16.361
- No, you don't understand.
- Mom, you've gotta help me find him.

892
01:11:16.436 --> 01:11:18.131
Nick, he's dead.

893
01:11:21.475 --> 01:11:23.670
He committed suicide.

894
01:11:26.613 --> 01:11:28.240
Why would you
keep that from me?

895
01:11:28.315 --> 01:11:29.976
I don't know.

896
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.847
I didn't want you
to remember him like that.

897
01:11:31.918 --> 01:11:35.684
The point is, Nick, it's you
I'm worried about.

898
01:11:36.957 --> 01:11:40.222
You can't do this alone.

899
01:11:40.294 --> 01:11:43.092
You need to see a doctor.

900
01:11:43.163 --> 01:11:46.291
You don't have to
have the same fate as yourfather.

901
01:11:47.467 --> 01:11:50.402
Nick, you can't
control everything.

902
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:52.631
You have to let it go.

903
01:12:04.418 --> 01:12:06.352
Another drink, please.

904
01:12:11.558 --> 01:12:13.048
Thanks.

905
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:18.831
Nick.
What's going on?

906
01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:20.958
Oh my God.

907
01:12:21.034 --> 01:12:22.899
What happened to you?

908
01:12:29.409 --> 01:12:31.434
Did you bring it?

909
01:12:38.218 --> 01:12:39.947
Where is Trevor?

910
01:12:42.456 --> 01:12:44.617
I can't believe that
was only a year ago.

911
01:12:44.691 --> 01:12:46.886
I know
something's wrong.

912
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.394
First, Trevor comes home
with a black eye.

913
01:12:49.463 --> 01:12:51.693
Then he says you have
some meeting together,

914
01:12:51.765 --> 01:12:53.392
but he doesn't
come home at all.

915
01:12:53.467 --> 01:12:55.799
And now you want me
to bring you some old picture?

916
01:12:59.606 --> 01:13:02.507
Nick, I'm really scared.

917
01:13:02.576 --> 01:13:04.407
I know.

918
01:13:06.847 --> 01:13:09.873
You know that
I'd do anything for Trevor, don't you?

919
01:13:12.586 --> 01:13:15.146
I'd do anything
for all you guys.

920
01:13:17.424 --> 01:13:19.358
Yeah.

921
01:13:20.994 --> 01:13:22.518
Come here.

922
01:13:26.199 --> 01:13:28.258
I know you're scared.

923
01:13:34.741 --> 01:13:36.834
I can't explain it...

924
01:13:38.078 --> 01:13:40.876
but I promise you
that Trevor's okay.

925
01:14:36.336 --> 01:14:37.826
Oh, great, guys.

926
01:14:37.904 --> 01:14:39.735
Check it out...

927
01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:43.003
I brought my own special
birthday candle.

928
01:14:43.076 --> 01:14:44.668
- Yes!
- It's drugs!

929
01:14:44.744 --> 01:14:46.575
Oh! My favorite.

930
01:14:46.646 --> 01:14:48.671
Light it!

931
01:14:52.886 --> 01:14:55.081
- Light it.
- Yes yes.

932
01:14:56.857 --> 01:14:58.791
Where are you going?

933
01:14:58.859 --> 01:15:01.487
- Somewhere.
- Oh, really?

934
01:15:01.561 --> 01:15:03.586
With you.

935
01:15:03.663 --> 01:15:05.392
Okay.

936
01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.227
I need to talk
to you alone.

937
01:15:09.302 --> 01:15:10.929
Oh.

938
01:15:12.739 --> 01:15:14.673
Put this on,
it might get cold.

939
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:16.766
Hmm.

940
01:15:21.615 --> 01:15:24.516
Ah. This looks exactly
the same as it did

941
01:15:24.584 --> 01:15:26.552
when you first
brought me here.

942
01:15:27.654 --> 01:15:30.214
I can't believe...
when was that?

943
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:32.918
- Three years ago.
- Three years ago.

944
01:15:32.993 --> 01:15:34.517
Wow.

945
01:15:36.096 --> 01:15:38.587
I can't imagine my life
without you now.

946
01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:44.135
Nick, I want
to tell you something.

947
01:15:44.204 --> 01:15:45.865
Me first.

948
01:15:45.939 --> 01:15:47.497
Okay.

949
01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:50.403
You need
to go to New York.

950
01:15:52.379 --> 01:15:54.574
- What?
- I know that it sounds strange,

951
01:15:54.648 --> 01:15:56.843
but trust me,
it's forthe best.

952
01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:58.612
Where is this coming from?

953
01:15:58.685 --> 01:16:01.552
This is your chance
to pursue your art,

954
01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:03.612
to... find out
about yourself,

955
01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:06.488
to not have to worry
about me or us or my job

956
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.687
or all that
other bullshit, just...

957
01:16:08.762 --> 01:16:10.696
- I don't want to be free.
- Listen to me.

958
01:16:10.764 --> 01:16:13.597
This is
your last chance to...

959
01:16:16.236 --> 01:16:18.761
pursue your own path
in life,

960
01:16:18.838 --> 01:16:20.533
one that
I can't fuck up.

961
01:16:22.342 --> 01:16:25.038
Well, I don't want to pursue
my own path. That wasn't the deal.

962
01:16:25.111 --> 01:16:26.601
- Listen.
- We were going to do this together

963
01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.171
and we were gonna work it out,
and you promised you would be there.

964
01:16:29.249 --> 01:16:31.809
Just trust me, I know, baby.
I don't think you're getting it.

965
01:16:31.885 --> 01:16:33.443
Julie...

966
01:16:43.096 --> 01:16:46.088
ljust need a little
space myself right now.

967
01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:51.537
I'm sorry.

968
01:16:54.608 --> 01:16:56.576
You're breaking up with me?

969
01:16:58.011 --> 01:17:00.605
- That's it?
- Yeah.

970
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:06.148
I don't think
there's anything left to be said.

971
01:17:18.598 --> 01:17:20.293
Nick, I'm pregnant.

972
01:17:43.256 --> 01:17:45.121
Trevor.

973
01:17:45.191 --> 01:17:47.455
Where's Julie?

974
01:17:47.527 --> 01:17:49.461
- What happened?
- Yeah, dude, she ran down here,

975
01:17:49.529 --> 01:17:51.690
grabbed your keys
and took off to your car.

976
01:18:03.677 --> 01:18:06.544
No! Oh God!

977
01:18:11.518 --> 01:18:14.009
- All right, here we go.
- Keep going to the point and back.

978
01:18:23.496 --> 01:18:26.158
Hey, man, what are you doing?
That's my car!

979
01:18:53.059 --> 01:18:55.960
Slow down.
Please, slow down.

980
01:18:59.232 --> 01:19:01.359
Oh God.

981
01:19:04.938 --> 01:19:07.133
- Oh, you've got to be kidding.
- Julie!

982
01:19:21.454 --> 01:19:25.015
- God!
- Pull over, Julie, please!

983
01:19:25.091 --> 01:19:26.388
Please, pull over.

984
01:19:26.459 --> 01:19:28.950
I'm sorry!
I love you!

985
01:19:29.028 --> 01:19:31.929
I didn't know!
I'm sorry!

986
01:19:31.998 --> 01:19:35.399
Julie, you have to
pull over!

987
01:19:35.468 --> 01:19:38.096
Pull over!
You don't understand!

988
01:19:38.171 --> 01:19:39.502
Please!

989
01:19:45.411 --> 01:19:47.140
Oh my God.

990
01:19:49.883 --> 01:19:51.680
I love you.

991
01:20:05.965 --> 01:20:08.229
I would do anything
for all you guys.

992
01:20:08.301 --> 01:20:10.633
You know that,
don't you?

993
01:20:46.306 --> 01:20:48.274
Hey, Nick.
You're awake.

994
01:20:49.609 --> 01:20:51.873
Come on, baby,
we've got a big day.

995
01:20:51.945 --> 01:20:53.810
I've got class
in a half-hour.

996
01:20:57.884 --> 01:21:00.216
Ah...

997
01:21:00.286 --> 01:21:02.413
That's right,
Nicky, yeah!

998
01:21:02.488 --> 01:21:04.752
Aw...

999
01:21:04.824 --> 01:21:07.088
Mommy has to go to class
in a half an hour.

1000
01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.720
That's right. Okay?

1001
01:21:09.796 --> 01:21:12.492
I'm gonna drop you off
at Grandma's. Yeah!
