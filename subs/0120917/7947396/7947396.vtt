Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.

177
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.048
You just hit yours 50 years ago.

-So, who's in my chair?
-(SNARLING)

179
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.512
Oh, oh! I know! YZMA.

180
00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.013
Yzma's in your chair, right?

181
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.766
Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack.

182
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.059
Got it!

183
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.686
(GRUNTS) Oof!

184
00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.021
Okay, you heard the man. Up, up, up.

185
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.232

Ah.

188
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.446
Okay. Show him in.

Uh, Afternoon, Your Highness.

191
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.370
I'm here
because I received a summons...

192
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.123
Hey, there he is! My main village man.

193
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.125
Um, Pacha.

194
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.584
Anyway, I got this summons...

195
00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.420
Pacha.

196
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.381
That's right.
You are just the man I wanted to see.

197
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.507
I am?

198
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.093
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

199
00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.556
You can fix my problem, can't you?

200
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.516
Sure. I'll do what I can.

201
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.102
Good, good.
That's just what I wanted to hear.

202
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.564
Are you aware of just how important
your village is to the empire?

203
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.859
Well, I know we grow the crops
that you use here at the palace.

204
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.777
We also herd the llamas that you...

205
00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.282
My village?

206
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.491
Oh, yeah.

207
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.160
You got a pretty sweet little setup there

208
00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:57.829
on top of that hill, don't you?
(LAUGHING)

209
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:02.417
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop
for the last six generations.

210
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.127
Uh-huh.

211
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:08.131
So tell me, where do you find
you get the most sun?

212
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:12.510
Oh, I'd say just on the other side
of those trees.

213
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:17.223
When the sun hits that ridge just right,
these hills sing.

214
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:18.808
Well, that settles it.

215
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.727
-Really?
-Yep. Problem solved.

216
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.103
Thanks for coming.

217
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.647
That's it? That's all you wanted me for?

218
00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:28.485
I just needed an insider's opinion
before I okay'd this spot for my pool.

219
00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.488
Uh, your pool?

220
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.199
Boo-yah! Welcome to Kuzcotopia,

-Isn't it great?

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.499
It's my birthday gift to me. Ha!

224
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.292
I'm so happy.

225
00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:46.294
Uh... Uh...

226
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:49.506
Um... I don't understand
how this could happen.

227
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.174
Well, let me clear it up for you.

228
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.469
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
I give the word,

229
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.387
and your town will be destroyed

230
00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.765

234
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.776
But, um, where will we live?

Hmmm.

236

Don't know, don't care. How's that?

237
00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.116
Oh, but wait. You can't...

238
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.746
When I give the word,

239
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.958
your little town thingy will be bye-bye.

240
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.835
Bye-bye!

241
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.128

He can't get rid of me that easily.

Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

247
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.936
Does he... A little to the left.

248
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.815
Have any idea of who he's dealing with?

249
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.985
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.

250
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.238
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

251
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.906
Yeah, go figure.

I remember you.

562
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.268
I remember telling you
that I was building my pool

563
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:22.438
where your house was,
and then you got mad at me.

564

Oh!

565
00:25:24.273 --> 00:25:26.025
And you turned me into a llama!

566
00:25:26.108 --> 00:25:28.068
What? No, I did not.

567
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.820
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.

568
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:31.405
Why would I kidnap a llama?

569
00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:34.575
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.

570
00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:35.868
What?

571
00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:39.705
Hmm. You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit.

572
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.458
Okay. I have to get back to the palace.

573
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:45.794
Yzma's got that "secret lab."

574
00:25:45.836 --> 00:25:48.714
I'll just snap my fingers
and order her to change me back.

575
00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.633
Hey, you. No time to waste. Let's go.

576
00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:58.724
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you? Now let's go.

577
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.729
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

578
00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:06.648
You want to run that by me again?

579
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.570
I can't let you go back
unless you change your mind

580
00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:14.239
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

581
00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:19.578
Hmm. I got a little secret for you.
Come here. No, closer.

582
00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.706
I don't make deals with peasants!

583
00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:26.043
Then I guess I can't take you back.

584
00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:27.795
Fine. I don't need you.

585
00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:29.505
I can find my own way back.

586
00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:30.756
I wouldn't recommend it.

587
00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:33.050
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

Nice try, pal.

00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:10.554
Mmm-hmm.

708
00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:12.848
I just think if you really thought about it,

709
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:15.475
you'd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop.

710
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:17.018
And why would I do that?

711
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:20.021
Because...

712
00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.565
Deep down, I think you'll realise

713
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:25.235
that you're forcing an entire village
out of their homes just for you.

714
00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:27.362
And that's...

715
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:29.030
Bad?

716
00:32:29.072 --> 00:32:30.490
(LAUGHING) Well, yeah.

717
00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:33.910
Nobody's that heartless.

718
00:32:33.994 --> 00:32:34.995
Mmm.

719
00:32:36.246 --> 00:32:37.497
Now take me back.

720
00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:40.083
What? Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?

721
00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.085
All you care about
is building your summer home

722
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:43.712
and filling it with stuff for you.

723
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.714
Uh, yeah. Doy. Me.

724
00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.716
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.

725
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.177
You're the only one that doesn't
seem to be with the program me,

726
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:51.803
eh, Pacha?

727
00:32:51.887 --> 00:32:54.973
You know what? Someday,
you're going to wind up all alone,

728
00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:57.267
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

729
00:32:57.851 --> 00:32:59.603
Thanks for that. I'll log that away.

730
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:03.440
Now, for the final time, I order you
to take me back to the palace.

731
00:33:04.107 --> 00:33:06.318
Looks to me like you're stuck out here,

732
00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:09.112
because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

733
00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:13.742
(IMITATES PACHA) Because unless
you change your mind,

734
00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.076
I'm not taking you back.

735
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.953
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.

736
00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:22.000
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything. I didn't...

737
00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:23.793
Somebody's throwing stuff.

738
00:33:23.877 --> 00:33:25.754
You going to build a fire or what?
What's going on?

739
00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:29.216
(SIGHS)
He's never going to change his mind.

740
00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:33.678
(SIGHS)
How am I ever going to get out of here?

741
00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:40.268
(SHIVERING)

742
00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:03.708
YZMA: And so, it is with great sadness

743
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:09.464
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince...

744
00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:10.549
(SOBBING)

745
00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.842
Taken from us so tragically

746
00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:15.845
on the very eve of his 18th birthday.

747
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.180
Poor little guy.

748
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:19.474
His legacy will live on in our hearts...

749
00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:20.809
He never had a chance.

750
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.811
For all eternity.

751
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:24.729
(SNIFFLES)

752
00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:27.524
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.

753
00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.025
Back to work.

754
00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:43.707
Kronk, darlin',

755
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.086
I must admit you had me worried
when you mixed up those poisons,

756
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:52.549
but now that KUZCO is dead,
all is forgiven.

757
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.342
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's...

758
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.511
He's dead, all right.
(CHUCKLES)

759
00:34:56.595 --> 00:35:00.682
I mean, you can't get much deader
than he... than he is right now.

760
00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:02.434
Unless, of course, we killed him again.

761
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:05.562
I suppose.

762
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:07.939
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.

763
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:10.775
Kronk...

764
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:12.485
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

765
00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:13.570
Kronk...

766
00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:15.697
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.

767
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:19.618
-Ahh!
-KUZCO is dead, right?

768
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.161
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

769
00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:24.539
I need to hear these words.

770
00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:26.916
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

771
00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:29.002
He's still alive?

772
00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:31.338
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

773
00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:33.006
Kronk...

774
00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:36.384
I just thought I'd give you the heads-up
in case KUZCO ever came back.

775
00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:38.178
He can't come back!

776
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:42.307
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward,
especially after that lovely eulogy.

777
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.892
You think?

778
00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:47.896
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!

779
00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:49.648
Now let's move!

780
00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:50.774
Dad, look out!

781
00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:51.858
(PANTING)

782
00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:53.818
TIPO, what is it?

783
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:56.029
I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log

784
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:59.908
and was careening out of control
down a raging river of death!

785
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:01.409
-(PANTING)
-All right, all right, it's okay.

786
00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:04.245
-It was awful!
-It's okay, it's okay. TIPO, calm down.

787
00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:05.872
It was just a dream.

788
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:08.541
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.

789
00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:11.544
Oh.

790
00:36:11.586 --> 00:36:14.297
Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.

791
00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:15.465
That's right.

792
00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:17.425
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

793
00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:19.469
Yeah, like that would ever happen.

794
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:21.179
-It could.
-Nuh-uh.

795
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:22.472
-Yeah-huh.
-Nuh-uh.

796
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:23.932
Yeah-huh.

797
00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:25.767
(BICKERING)

798
00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:27.435
Good night, you two.

799
00:36:27.477 --> 00:36:28.478
BOTH: Night, Mom!

800
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:29.562
(CONTINUE BICKERING)

801
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.815

(COUGHS)

804
00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:41.282
Brr!

805
00:36:41.449 --> 00:36:42.951
KUZCO: Uh, hey.

806
00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:49.124
Thanks.

807
00:36:49.249 --> 00:36:50.250
Oh.

808
00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:52.836
No problem.

809
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:55.797
Feels like wool.

810
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.257
Yeah.

811
00:36:57.298 --> 00:36:58.508
Alpaca?

812
00:36:58.591 --> 00:36:59.968
Oh, yeah, it is.

813
00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.386
Oh, yeah, I thought so.

814
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:04.097
It's nice.

815
00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:05.682
My wife made it.

816
00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:06.975
Oh, she knits?

817
00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:08.685
Crochets.

818
00:37:08.768 --> 00:37:10.979
Crochets? Nice.

819
00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.313
Thanks.

820
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:16.943
(CROAKING)

821
00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.196
So...

822
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.492
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

823
00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:25.827
we'd...

824
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.748
I mean, there's lots of hilltops,
and maybe I might, you know...

825
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:31.082
I might...

826
00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:34.043
Are you saying...

827
00:37:34.127 --> 00:37:35.670
You've changed your mind?

828
00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:37.464
Oh, well, I...

829
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:41.968
Because you know that means you're
doing something nice for someone else.

830
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.803
No, I know that. I know.

831
00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:45.930
And you're all right with that?

832
00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:47.307
Yes.

833
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:54.647
What?

834
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.736
Don't shake unless you mean it.

835
00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:08.870
All right.

836
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.208
Let's get you back to the palace.

837
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.084
Oh, by the way, thanks.

838
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:17.712
No...

839
00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:19.506
Thank you.

840
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.853
PACHA: Okay.
Once we cross this bridge,

841
00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:35.313
it's only an hour to the palace.

842
00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:37.732
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.

843
00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:38.858
I believe it.

844
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.193
-What was that?
-Nothing.

845
00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:41.653
Ohh!

846
00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:43.530
Whoa!

847
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.697
KUZCO!

848
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:47.826
KUZCO!

849
00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:49.494
-Yeah?
-Quick, help me up!

850
00:38:51.246 --> 00:38:53.206
No. I don't think I will.

851
00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:54.499
You're going to leave me here?

852
00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:56.835
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

853
00:38:56.918 --> 00:38:58.586
but I kind of like this better.

854
00:38:58.628 --> 00:39:00.255
I thought you were a changed man.

855
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:03.758
Oh, come on. I had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city.

856
00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:05.593
So all of it was a lie?

857
00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:07.762
Well, yeah. No, wait.

858
00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:11.933
Uh, yeah, yeah. It all was a lie.

859
00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.268
Toodles.

860
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:15.603
We shook hands on it!

861
00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:16.688
(ECHOING)

862
00:39:19.107 --> 00:39:21.985
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

863
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:23.653
You need hands.

864
00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:26.573
Ha. Okay. Buh-bye.

865
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:27.615
Ah!

866
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:30.285
Are you okay? Are you all right?

867
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:32.453
Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm all right.

868
00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:34.122
Good!

869
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.165
That's for going back on your promise!

870
00:39:36.291 --> 00:39:37.333
(YELLS)

871
00:39:37.417 --> 00:39:40.795
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me
and taking me to your village...

872
00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:43.756
Which I'm still gonna destroy,
by the way. (LAUGHS)

873
00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:44.883
No touchy.

874
00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:45.967
Ohh!

875
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.803
Why did I risk my life
for a selfish brat like you?

876
00:39:48.845 --> 00:39:50.638
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

877
00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:52.265
but, oh, you proved me wrong.

878
00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:55.643
Oh, boo-hoo.
Now I feel really bad. Bad llama.

879
00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:57.478
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

880
00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:59.397
and then all my problems
would be over.

881
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.566
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.

882
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:03.109
Let's end this.

883
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:04.193
Ladies first.

00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:51.325
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know,

1229
00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:55.454
what I said to you back at the diner,
that, I didn't really...

1230
00:56:56.955 --> 00:56:59.833
So, you tired of being a llama?

1231
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.337
(SNIFFLES) Yes!

1232
00:57:03.378 --> 00:57:04.379
(SNIFFS)

1233
00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:07.341
Okay, we're just gonna stop
at the house and get some supplies.

1234
00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:09.384
-Then we'll be on our way, right?
-Right.

1235
00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:12.137
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

1236
00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:13.347
My relatives?

1237
00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:15.307
We just sent them up to your house.

1238
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:16.433
What did they look like?

1239
00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:20.228
See, there was this big guy
and this older woman who was...

1240
00:57:20.312 --> 00:57:22.064
How would you describe her?

1241
00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:23.565
Scary beyond all reason.

1242
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:25.025
Yeah, that's it.

1243
00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:28.362
So, remind me again
how you're related to Pacha?

1244
00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:32.616
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's
wife's step-niece's great-aunt.

1245
00:57:33.867 --> 00:57:35.869
(CHUCKLES) Twice removed.

1246
00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:38.121
Uh-huh.

1247
00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:39.957
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1248
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.626
<i>Ninety-nine monkeys
jumpin' on the bed</i>

1249
00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:45.545
<i>One fell off and bumped his head</i>

1250
00:57:45.587 --> 00:57:48.757
You know, I am so sorry
that you had to come all this way,

1251
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.301
but as I said to you before,

1252
00:57:51.385 --> 00:57:53.887
you may recall, Pacha is not here.

1253
00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:55.722
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.

1254
00:57:55.806 --> 00:57:59.768
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

1255
00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:01.311
Oops! (CHUCKLES)

1256
00:58:01.395 --> 00:58:02.437
Silly me.

1257
00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:04.773
No, no. Allow me.

1258
00:58:09.444 --> 00:58:10.570
She's hiding something.

1259
00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:12.489
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1260
00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:14.658
Okay, but I still have 94 monkeys to go.

1261
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:16.159
Grr!

1262
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.037
So, while we're waiting for Paca...

1263
00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:22.290
-Pacha.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, yes. Um...

1264
00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:24.835
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1265
00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:28.255
You know, why don't you just come
back when Pacha gets home?

1266
00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:31.425
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...

1267
00:58:31.717 --> 00:58:33.760
(STAMMERS) Excuse me, won't you?

1268
00:58:33.802 --> 00:58:35.679
I think I left something in the oven.

1269
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:40.308
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.

1270
00:58:40.392 --> 00:58:42.102
-Kronk, it's time!
-Okay!

1271
00:58:43.103 --> 00:58:44.104
Grr!

1272
00:58:44.271 --> 00:58:47.774
So, we have to get back to the palace,
find the lab, and change him back.

1273
00:58:47.816 --> 00:58:49.276
-Hi there!
-Aah!

1274
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.862
-Um, that was him.
-Whoops.

1275
00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:54.990
You know what?

1276
00:58:55.073 --> 00:58:57.492
I don't believe
you're really my great-aunt.

1277
00:58:57.576 --> 00:58:59.828
You're more like my great-great-great...

1278
00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:02.622
Go. I'll stall them long enough
for you two to get a head start.

1279
00:59:02.706 --> 00:59:04.041
Thanks, honey.

1280
00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:07.002
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.

1281
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:10.088
-Great-great-great...
-Grr.

1282
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:12.924
All right! Are you through?

1283
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.926
-Great-great-aunt.
-So, where were we?

1284
00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:16.511
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until...

1285
00:59:16.595 --> 00:59:18.555
I show you the house. Of course.

1286
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:21.933
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1287
00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:24.352
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1288
00:59:25.145 --> 00:59:28.482
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.

1289
00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:30.275
YZMA: There is no handle in here.

1290
00:59:30.317 --> 00:59:32.611
There's not? Are you sure?

1291
00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:34.571
All right, I've had enough of this.

1292
00:59:34.946 --> 00:59:38.033
Tell us where the talking llama is and
we'll burn your house to the ground.

1293
00:59:38.158 --> 00:59:40.744
-Uh, don't you mean "or"?
-(SIGHS)

1294
00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:44.498
Tell us where the talking llama is
or we'll burn your house to the ground.

1295
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:45.624
Well, which is it?

1296
00:59:45.665 --> 00:59:47.501
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1297
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.837
That's it! Kronk, break the door down!

1298
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:53.924
Break it down? Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.

1299
00:59:54.007 --> 00:59:56.134
I don't care, you fool. Get out of my way.

1300
00:59:56.176 --> 00:59:58.178
I'll break it down myself.

1301
00:59:58.261 --> 01:00:00.889
-YZMA: A-one...
-Okay, kids, you know what to do.

1302
01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.891
-Two...
-Right, Mom!

1303
01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.518
Three!

1304
01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.394
Aah!

1305
01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:20.909
Okay, children, on your mark,
get set, go!

1306
01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:24.454
Ow, ow!
Stop it, you little brats!

1307
01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:25.831
Huh?

1308
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.207
YZMA: Ow!

1309
01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:31.211
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1310
01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.420
(LAUGHING)

1311
01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:34.714
Well, I had a great time.

1312
01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:38.051
Let's not wait until the next
family reunion to get together.

1313
01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:39.219
YZMA: Kronk!

1314
01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.429
I gotta run.

1315
01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.193
(THUNDER CRACKING)

1316
01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:40.447
(THUNDER)

1317
01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.459
Okay, why does she even
have that lever?

1318
01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:53.543
(YELPS)

1319
01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.296
SKULL: <i>Please remain seated</i>

1320
01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:58.298
<i>and keep your arms
and legs in at all times.</i>

1321
01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:00.217
PACHA: Aah!

1322
01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:03.637
Huh?

1323
01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:09.309
-What does it look like?
-I don't know. Just keep looking.

1324
01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:10.560
Over here!

1325
01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:14.564
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1326
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.775
YZMA: Oh, my.

1327
01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.652
Looking for this?

1328
01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.656
No! It can't be!

1329
01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.658
-How did you get back here before us?
-Uh...

1330
01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:27.911
How did we, Kronk?

1331
01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:31.206
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.

1332
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.500
Oh, well, back to business.

1333
01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.335
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Okay, I admit it.

1334
01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:37.045
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1335
01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:39.965
but, YZMA,
do you really want to kill me?

1336
01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:43.260
Just think of it as you're being let go,

1337
01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.595
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1338
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:49.349
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1339
01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:52.602
Hey, that's kind of like what he said
to you when you got fired.

1340
01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:57.565
I know. It's called a cruel irony
like my dependence on you.

1341
01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:59.276
I can't believe this is happening!

1342
01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.444
Then I bet you weren't expecting this.

1343
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.904
-No!
-Aah!

1344
01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:04.489
Ah-ha!

1345
01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.032
(SIGHS) Oh, okay.

1346
01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.909
(LAUGHS) Finish them off.

1347
01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:13.373
KRONK DEVIL: <i>Hey, you're not
backing down now, are you, big guy?</i>

1348
01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:16.167
Uh, where's the other guy?

1349
01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:19.254
Yo!

1350
01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:21.214
Sorry I'm late. So, what'd I miss?

1351
01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.966
Well, YZMA just tossed me this knife

1352
01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:25.302
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1353
01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:28.096
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1354
01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:29.389
and quite honestly...

1355
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:32.392
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1356
01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.935
This one simple thing.

1357
01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.437
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.

1358
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.604
Whoa! Now.

1359
01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:39.566
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1360
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.650
Ouch.

1361
01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:41.901
And do you want to know
something else?

1362
01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:43.987
I've never liked your spinach puffs.

1363
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.448
-(GASPS)
-Never!

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.199
(SOBS)

1365
01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:50.410
That's it. She's going down.

1366
01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:51.953
Now, now, remember, guys.

1367
01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:55.248
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

1368
01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.753
ALL: that'll work.

1369
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.803
Strange. That usually works.

1370
01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.263
And so does this!

1371
01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.015
Ah, should have seen that coming.

1372
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.600
Whoa!

1373
01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:15.852
Aah!

1374
01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.771
Give me that vial!

1375
01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.358
-Oof!
-Ah! Ha ha!

(YZMA YELLING)

1377
01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.782
Oops! Clumsy me.

Kill them! They murdered the emperor!

No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me... KUZCO!

1382
01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.219
They're not listening to me!

1383
01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.221
Just take 'em all!

1385
01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:00.146
Get them!

1386
01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:03.316
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?

1387
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.860
You're excused. Anyone else?

1388
01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:07.362
ALL: No, we're good.

1389
01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:08.780
Get them!

1390

We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

1391
01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.829
Uh, Pacha? A little help!
