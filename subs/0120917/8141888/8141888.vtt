00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.441
Aah!

2
00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.479
<i>Will you take a look at that?</i>

3
00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:36.878
<i>Pretty pathetic, huh?</i>

4
00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:38.357
<i>Well, you'll never believe this,</i>

5
00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.476
<i>but that llama you're looking at
was once a human being.</i>

6
00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:43.076
<i>And not just any human being.</i>

7
00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:44.555
<i>That guy was an emperor.</i>

8
00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.554
<i>A rich, powerful ball of charisma.</i>

9
00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:47.873
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

10
00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:50.672
<i>This is his story.</i>

11
00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:52.512
<i>Well, actually my story.</i>

12
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:55.710
<i>That's right. I'm that llama.</i>

13
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.109
<i>The name is KUZCO...</i>

14
00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:00.468
<i>Emperor KUZCO.</i>

15
00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:04.227
<i>I was the world's nicest guy,
and they ruined my life for no reason.</i>

16
00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:05.466
<i>Oh, is that hard to believe?</i>

17
00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.625
<i>Look, I tell you what.
You go back aways...</i>

18
00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:10.623
<i>You know, before I was a llama,
and this will all make sense.</i>

19
00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:13.263
<i>All right, now see,
that's a little too far back.</i>

20
00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:15.382
<i>Oh-ho. Look at me!</i>

21
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:16.981
<i>That's me as a baby.</i>

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.820
<i>Ahem!</i>

23
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.059
<i>All right, let's move ahead.</i>

24
00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.491
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:42.450
<i>There are despots and dictators</i>

26
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:44.890
<i>Political manipulators</i>

27
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.048
<i>There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas</i>

28
00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.047
<i>There are kings and catty tyrants</i>

29
00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:54.166
<i>Who are so lacking in refinements</i>

30
00:01:54.205 --> 00:01:56.924
<i>They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees</i>

31
00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:59.524
<i>He was born and raised to rule</i>

32
00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:02.083
<i>No one has ever been as cool</i>

33
00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:05.241
<i>In a thousand years of aristocracy</i>

34
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:08.679
<i>An enigma and a mystery</i>

35
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.639
<i>In Mesoamerican history</i>

36
00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.078
<i>The quintessence
of perfection that is he</i>

37
00:02:15.476 --> 00:02:17.716
<i>Okay, this is the real me. Not this.</i>

38
00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:19.116
<i>This. Not this.</i>

39
00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:20.635
<i>Winner! Loser.</i>

40
00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.353
<i>Okay, see this palace?
Everyone in it is at my command.</i>

41
00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:25.712
<i>Check this out.</i>

42
00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.432
Butler.

43
00:02:27.472 --> 00:02:28.791
Chef.

44
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:30.751
Theme song guy.

45
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.349
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

46
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.269
<i>He's the sovereign lord of the nation</i>

47
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.748
<i>He's the hippest cat in creation</i>

48
00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:39.667
<i>He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z</i>

49
00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:43.106
<i>And this perfect world will spin</i>

50
00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:45.224
<i>Around his every little whim</i>

51
00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:47.983
<i>'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with</i>

52
00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:49.023
Me.

53
00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:50.062
<i>What's his name?</i>

54
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.381
<i>KUZCO</i>

55
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.700
<i>That's his name</i>

56
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.420
<i>KUZCO</i>

57
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.459
<i>He's the king of the world</i>

58
00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:00.498
<i>KUZCO</i>

59
00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:02.217
<i>Is he hip or what?</i>

60
00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.097
<i>KUZCO</i>

61
00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:05.736
<i>Yeah</i>

62
00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:09.214
Gow!

63
00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:11.293
<i>You threw off my groove!</i>

64
00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:14.452
<i>I'm sorry, but you've thrown off
the emperor's groove.</i>

65
00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:17.251
Sorry!

66
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:19.209
You were saying?

67
00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.649
<i>What's his name?
KUZCO</i>

68
00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.008
<i>KUZCO</i>

69
00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.965
<i>That's his name</i>

70
00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.684
<i>Is he hip or what?</i>

71
00:03:35.603 --> 00:03:39.081
<i>Don't you know
he's the king of the world?</i>

72
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:43.720
<i>Whoa, yeah</i>

73
00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.119
Ow!

74
00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.558
Ha!

75
00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:48.558
Boom, baby!

76
00:03:49.237 --> 00:03:51.996
Aah! Your Highness,
it is time for you to choose your bride.

77
00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:53.436
All righty.

78
00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:54.915
Trot out the ladies.

79
00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.995
Let's take a look-see.

80
00:03:57.074 --> 00:03:59.393
Hate your hair. Not likely.

81
00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:01.353
Yikes, yikes, yikes.

82
00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:04.951
And let me guess.
You have a great personality.

83
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:06.670
Is this really the best you could do?

84
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:09.389
Oh, yes. Oh, no. I mean, perhaps...

85
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.308
<i>What is he babbling about?</i>

86
00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:13.548
<i>He's like the thing
that wouldn't shut up.</i>

87
00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:17.185
<i>Anyway, still wondering
about that llama in the opening?</i>

88
00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:20.664
<i>Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life.</i>

89
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:24.583
<i>First, there's Pacha.</i>

90
00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.422
Uh, excuse me.
I'm here to see Emperor KUZCO.

91
00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:28.980
You see, I got this summons...

92
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.659
Inside, up the stairs,
and to the left. Just follow the signs.

93
00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.378
Oh, great. Thanks a lot.

94
00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:39.576
<i>Uh, and don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look.</i>

95
00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:40.616
Oh!

96
00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:42.855
Uh, pardon me. That's mine.

97
00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:43.895
Oh, here you go.

98
00:04:43.974 --> 00:04:45.374
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

99
00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.813
Aah! Oh, hey. Are you all right?
Here. Let me...

100
00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:50.732
- Oh, you're so very kind.
- What happened?

101
00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:53.770
<i>Well, I threw off the emperor's groove.</i>

102
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.930
- What?
- His groove!

103
00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:57.609
The rhythm in which he lives his life,
his pattern of behaviour.

104
00:04:57.648 --> 00:04:58.689
I threw it off,

105
00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:01.048
and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

106
00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:03.966
Oh, really?
I'm supposed to see him today.

107
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:05.765
<i>Don't throw off his groove!</i>

108
00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:06.765
Oh, okay.

109
00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:08.244
Beware the groove.

110
00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:09.723
Hey, are you gonna be all right?

111
00:05:09.763 --> 00:05:11.284
Groove.

112
00:05:11.763 --> 00:05:13.282
<i>You see what I mean?</i>

113
00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:15.962
<i>This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is,</i>

114
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.321
<i>he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next.</i>

115
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.399
And why
have you come here today?

116
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.838
Well... Your Highness...
I mean, Your Grace.

117
00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:26.476
<i>Okay, gang.
Check out this piece of work.</i>

118
00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:29.676
<i>This is YZMA, the emperor's advisor,</i>

119
00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.275
<i>living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth.</i>

120
00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:34.553
<i>And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man.</i>

121
00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.553
<i>Every decade or so
she gets a new one.</i>

122
00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:38.391
<i>This year's model is called Kronk.</i>

123
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:42.310
Yeah, I got that there, YZMA.

124
00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:44.949
Uh!

125
00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:46.788
<i>Yep, that's Kronk.</i>

126
00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:49.587
<i>Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit</i>

127
00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:52.146
<i>of trying to run the country
behind my back,</i>

128
00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.105
<i>and I'm thinkin' that's got to stop.</i>

129
00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:57.304
It is no concern of mine
whether your family has...

130
00:05:57.384 --> 00:05:58.503
What was it again?

131
00:05:58.543 --> 00:05:59.662
Um, food.

132
00:06:00.022 --> 00:06:03.781
Ha! You really should have thought
of that before you became peasants.

133
00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:07.100
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!

134
00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.539
But I... Okay.

135
00:06:12.457 --> 00:06:13.418
Ugh.

136
00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:15.176
The nerve of
some of those peasants, huh?

137
00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:17.695
Tell me about it. Aah!

138
00:06:17.735 --> 00:06:18.695
Hi there.

139
00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:20.214
Ooh, Your Highness.

140
00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:21.254
Ahem.

141
00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:23.133
Oh, oh, oh. Um...

142
00:06:23.493 --> 00:06:24.852
Uh, you were doing it again.

143
00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:27.731
Doing?
Doing... Doing what?

144
00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:29.010
Doing my job.

145
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.809
I'm the emperor,
and you're the emperor's advisor.

146
00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.569
- Remember that?
- But, Your Highness,

147
00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:36.127
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

148
00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:37.166
<i>Whoa!</i>

149
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.166
<i>Look at these wrinkles.</i>

150
00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:42.325
<i>What is holding this woman together?</i>

151
00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:46.444
<i>What the...
How long has that been there?</i>

152
00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:48.682
Good thinkin', YZMA.
What do you say, KUZCO?

153
00:06:48.762 --> 00:06:50.242
Whoa! No touchy!

154
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:52.041
No touchy. No touch.

155
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.680
Uh, excuse me, Your Highness.
The village leader is here to see you.

156
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.239
Oh, great. Send him in.

157
00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.878
Oh, and by the way, you're fired.

158
00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:58.878
Fired?

159
00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.397
What do you mean, fired?

160
00:07:01.436 --> 00:07:02.877
Um, how else can I say it?

161
00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:05.435
You're being let go,
your department's being downsized,

162
00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:07.954
you're part of an outplacement,
we're going in a different direction,

163
00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:10.834
we're not picking up your option...
Take your pick. I got more.

164
00:07:10.913 --> 00:07:12.952
But I... You... Uh...

165
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:14.071
Uhh.

166
00:07:14.912 --> 00:07:16.390
But... But, Your Highness,

167
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:18.990
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

168
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.028
for many, many years.

169
00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.787
Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.

170
00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:26.986
You just hit yours 50 years ago.

171
00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:30.624
So, who's in my chair?

172
00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:32.224
Oh, oh! I know! YZMA.

173
00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:33.663
Yzma's in your chair, right?

174
00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.302
Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack.

175
00:07:36.382 --> 00:07:37.542
Got it!

176
00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:39.101
Oof!

177
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.340
Okay, you heard the man. Up, up, up.

178
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.459
I'm okay. I'm fine.

179
00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:45.738
Ah.

180
00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:49.416
Okay. Show him in.

181
00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:52.096
Ahem.

182
00:07:52.496 --> 00:07:54.334
Uh, Afternoon, Your Highness.

183
00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:56.054
I'm here
because I received a summons...

184
00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:58.693
Hey, there he is! My main village man.

185
00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:00.613
Um, Pacha.

186
00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:02.011
Anyway, I got this summons...

187
00:08:02.092 --> 00:08:03.771
Pacha.

188
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.609
That's right.
You are just the man I wanted to see.

189
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.689
I am?

190
00:08:07.768 --> 00:08:10.168
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

191
00:08:11.927 --> 00:08:14.446
You can fix my problem, can't you?

192
00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:16.325
Sure. I'll do what I can.

193
00:08:16.404 --> 00:08:18.804
Good, good.
That's just what I wanted to hear.

194
00:08:19.244 --> 00:08:22.123
Are you aware of just how important
your village is to the empire?

195
00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:25.282
Well, I know we grow the crops
that you use here at the palace.

196
00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:27.121
We also herd the llamas that you...

197
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.439
My village?

198
00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.598
Oh, yeah.

199
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.198
You got a pretty sweet little setup there

200
00:08:34.278 --> 00:08:36.756
on top of that hill, don't you?

201
00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:41.155
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop
for the last six generations.

202
00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:42.794
Uh-huh.

203
00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:46.633
So tell me, where do you find
you get the most sun?

204
00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:50.831
Oh, I'd say just on the other side
of those trees.

205
00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:55.349
When the sun hits that ridge just right,
these hills sing.

206
00:08:55.429 --> 00:08:56.868
Well, that settles it.

207
00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:58.708
- Really?
- Yep. Problem solved.

208
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.027
Thanks for coming.

209
00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:02.466
That's it? That's all you wanted me for?

210
00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:06.145
I just needed an insider's opinion
before I okay'd this spot for my pool.

211
00:09:07.264 --> 00:09:09.023
Uh, your pool?

212
00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:11.623
Boo-yah! Welcome to Kuzcotopia,

213
00:09:11.702 --> 00:09:15.221
my ultimate summer getaway
complete with water slide.

214
00:09:15.861 --> 00:09:17.340
- What?
- Isn't it great?

215
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.579
It's my birthday gift to me. Ha!

216
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.298
I'm so happy.

217
00:09:21.657 --> 00:09:23.218
Uh... Uh...

218
00:09:23.378 --> 00:09:26.296
Um... I don't understand
how this could happen.

219
00:09:26.376 --> 00:09:27.896
Well, let me clear it up for you.

220
00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:31.055
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
I give the word,

221
00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:32.893
and your town will be destroyed

222
00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:35.173
to make way for this...

223
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.369
So, if I were you, I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms

224
00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:43.410
on the way home.

225
00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.728
But, um, where will we live?

226
00:09:45.888 --> 00:09:47.007
Hmmm.

227
00:09:47.607 --> 00:09:50.126
Don't know, don't care. How's that?

228
00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:51.806
Oh, but wait. You can't...

229
00:09:55.324 --> 00:09:57.203
When I give the word,

230
00:09:57.284 --> 00:10:00.282
your little town thingy will be bye-bye.

231
00:10:00.922 --> 00:10:02.081
Bye-bye!

232
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:03.321
Oh, wait. No...

233
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.200
Boo-hoo.

234
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.839
<i>Oh, yeah.
Everything was goin' my way.</i>

235
00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.877
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

236
00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:11.917
He can't get rid of me that easily.

237
00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:16.835
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

238
00:10:16.915 --> 00:10:19.433
Does he... A little to the left.

239
00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:23.152
Have any idea of who he's dealing with?

240
00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:26.191
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.

241
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.310
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

242
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.909
Yeah, go figure.

243
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:32.828
Well, it's better
you're takin' out your anger

244
00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:34.787
on these things instead
of the real KUZCO, huh?

245
00:10:35.986 --> 00:10:37.946
That's it, Kronk! That's it!

246
00:10:38.026 --> 00:10:40.664
I'll get rid of KUZCO.

247
00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:42.665
The real KUZCO?

248
00:10:42.744 --> 00:10:45.103
Of course the real KUZCO.

249
00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:46.822
Don't you see? It's perfect.

250
00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:49.302
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne,

251
00:10:49.342 --> 00:10:52.739
I'll take over and rule the empire.

252
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.219
Brilliant!

253
00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:56.817
So how does that work
with you bein' fired and all?

254
00:10:56.858 --> 00:10:59.497
The only ones who know
about that are the three of us,

255
00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:01.056
soon to be the two of us.

256
00:11:01.136 --> 00:11:02.576
And I'm one of those two, right?

257
00:11:02.656 --> 00:11:03.616
To the secret lab!

258
00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:08.653
Pull the lever, Kronk.

259
00:11:08.693 --> 00:11:10.013
Wrong lever!

260
00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:11.452
Huh?

261
00:11:11.812 --> 00:11:14.411
Why do we even have that lever?

262
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.449
Get out of my way!

263
00:11:19.489 --> 00:11:20.488
<i>Please remain seated</i>

264
00:11:20.568 --> 00:11:22.608
<i>and keep your arms and legs
in at all times.</i>

265
00:11:23.007 --> 00:11:23.967
Whee!

266
00:11:24.007 --> 00:11:25.445
Faster, faster!

267
00:11:25.765 --> 00:11:27.925
YZMA, put your hands in the air!

268
00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:30.403
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

269
00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:37.001
Ah, how shall I do it?

270
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:38.600
Oh, I know.

271
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:40.760
<i>I'll turn him into a flea,</i>

272
00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:42.399
<i>a harmless little flea,</i>

273
00:11:42.438 --> 00:11:44.238
<i>and then I'll put that flea in a box,</i>

274
00:11:44.318 --> 00:11:46.077
<i>and then I'll put that box
inside of another box,</i>

275
00:11:46.157 --> 00:11:47.997
<i>and then I'll mail that box to myself,</i>

276
00:11:48.037 --> 00:11:50.155
<i>and when it arrives...</i>

277
00:11:50.236 --> 00:11:51.955
<i>I'll smash it with a hammer!</i>

278
00:11:52.915 --> 00:11:55.233
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!

279
00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:56.313
Genius, I say!

280
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.870
Or, to save on postage,

281
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.789
I'll just poison him with this.

282
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:07.148
Take it, Kronk. Oh, ho, ho.

283
00:12:07.188 --> 00:12:08.788
Feel the power.

284
00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:09.828
Oh...

285
00:12:09.907 --> 00:12:10.867
I can feel it.

286
00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:12.867
Our moment of triumph approaches.

287
00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:16.545
It's dinner time.

288
00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:28.460
So, is everything ready for tonight?

289
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.939
<i>Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off
with soup and a light salad</i>

290
00:12:31.018 --> 00:12:32.377
and then see how we feel after that.

291
00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:34.577
Not the dinner...

292
00:12:34.657 --> 00:12:35.856
The you-know...

293
00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:38.056
Oh, right. The poison...

294
00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:39.295
The poison for KUZCO,

295
00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:41.574
the poison chosen
specially to kill KUZCO,

296
00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:42.854
Kuzco's poison.

297
00:12:44.253 --> 00:12:45.893
- That poison?
- Yes! That poison.

298
00:12:45.972 --> 00:12:47.052
Got you covered.

299
00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:48.251
Excellent.

300
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:51.410
A few drops in his drink,
then I'll propose a toast,

301
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.489
and he will be dead before dessert.

302
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.927
Which is a real shame,
because it's gonna be delicious.

303
00:12:57.008 --> 00:12:57.968
Boom, bam, baby!

304
00:12:58.048 --> 00:12:59.327
Let's get to the grub.

305
00:12:59.407 --> 00:13:02.206
I am one hungry king of the world.

306
00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:05.964
So, no hard feelings about being let go?

307
00:13:07.004 --> 00:13:08.603
None whatsoever.

308
00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:12.601
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.

309
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:15.480
Drink. Right.

310
00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:32.193
Your Highness.

311
00:13:33.472 --> 00:13:34.632
Is something burning?

312
00:13:34.672 --> 00:13:36.271
My spinach puffs!

313
00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:42.669
Ahem.

314
00:13:43.469 --> 00:13:46.386
So, he seems nice.

315
00:13:46.467 --> 00:13:48.066
He is.

316
00:13:50.344 --> 00:13:52.864
He's what, in his late 20s?

317
00:13:52.904 --> 00:13:55.104
I'm not sure.

318
00:13:55.743 --> 00:13:56.703
Saved 'em!

319
00:13:56.743 --> 00:13:57.782
- That's great.
- Great!

320
00:13:57.862 --> 00:13:58.981
- Good job.
- Very good job.

321
00:13:59.062 --> 00:14:00.741
Watch it. They're still hot.

322
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:02.260
Ahem.

323
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.540
Ahem!

324
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.978
Kronk. The emperor needs his drink.

325
00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:11.777
Right. Oh, right.

326
00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:21.173
Hey, Kronky,
everything okay back there?

327
00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.372
Well...

328
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:23.650
Oh, uh...

329
00:14:24.411 --> 00:14:26.650
Ooh. The drinks were a bit on the...

330
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.689
Mmm.

331
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.888
Oh... Uh... Warm side.

332
00:14:32.448 --> 00:14:34.806
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.

333
00:14:34.847 --> 00:14:36.846
Yes, Kronk.

334
00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:38.125
Riveting.

335
00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:40.325
A toast to the emperor!

336
00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.003
Long live KUZCO!

337
00:14:43.962 --> 00:14:45.283
Don't drink the wine.

338
00:14:45.362 --> 00:14:46.721
Poison.

339
00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:54.398
Ah! Tasty.

340
00:14:56.357 --> 00:14:57.318
Finally!

341
00:14:57.837 --> 00:14:58.997
Good work, Kronk.

342
00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:01.156
Oh, they're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.

343
00:15:01.196 --> 00:15:03.314
Now to get rid of the body.

344
00:15:04.234 --> 00:15:06.394
Okay! What were we saying?

345
00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:09.632
Uh, we were just making a toast

346
00:15:09.673 --> 00:15:10.872
to your long and...

347
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.630
Healthy rule.

348
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.188
Right. So what are you gonna do?

349
00:15:17.268 --> 00:15:19.587
I mean, you've been
around here a long time,

350
00:15:19.628 --> 00:15:21.506
and I really mean a long time.

351
00:15:21.707 --> 00:15:22.746
Ahem.

352
00:15:22.827 --> 00:15:26.385
It might be difficult
for someone of your age

353
00:15:26.465 --> 00:15:28.264
adjusting to life in the private sector.

354
00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:31.983
Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal?
Be a friend? Ha, ha.

355
00:15:33.142 --> 00:15:34.302
Now,
about you finding new work...

356
00:15:34.382 --> 00:15:35.861
Hit him on the head.

357
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:37.380
That's gonna be tough.

358
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.621
More broccoli?

359
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.259
Because you're... You know.

360
00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:42.579
Let's face it. You're no spring chicken,

361
00:15:42.618 --> 00:15:44.737
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

362
00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:48.176
What? A llama?

363
00:15:48.216 --> 00:15:50.135
He's supposed to be dead!

364
00:15:50.174 --> 00:15:51.854
Yeah, weird.

365
00:15:52.814 --> 00:15:55.013
Let me see that vial.

366
00:15:57.492 --> 00:15:59.452
This isn't poison.

367
00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:03.290
This is extract of llama.
Ugh!

368
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.888
You know, in my defence,
your poisons all look alike.

369
00:16:05.968 --> 00:16:08.088
You might think about
relabeling some of them.

370
00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:11.566
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

371
00:16:12.726 --> 00:16:14.085
What about dinner?

372
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:17.404
Kronk, this is kind of important.

373
00:16:17.483 --> 00:16:19.484
How about dessert?

374
00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:22.082
Well, I suppose there's time for dessert.

375
00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:23.601
And coffee?

376
00:16:23.681 --> 00:16:25.600
All right. A quick cup of coffee.

377
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.559
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

378
00:16:33.797 --> 00:16:35.076
<i>Cha cha cha cha</i>

379
00:16:35.115 --> 00:16:36.476
<i>Guess where I am right now.</i>

380
00:16:36.516 --> 00:16:38.714
<i>Uh-huh. In the bag.</i>

381
00:16:38.754 --> 00:16:41.954
<i>Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.</i>

382
00:16:42.513 --> 00:16:44.393
Hey!

383
00:16:44.472 --> 00:16:47.231
<i>Ugh,
he's doing his own theme music?</i>

384
00:16:56.347 --> 00:16:58.426
<i>Big, dumb, and tone deaf.</i>

385
00:16:58.466 --> 00:17:01.025
<i>I am so glad
I was unconscious for all of this.</i>

386
00:17:04.784 --> 00:17:06.383
Mission accomplished.

387
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.697
<i>You're not
just gonna let him die like that, are you?</i>

388
00:17:19.778 --> 00:17:21.337
My shoulder angel.

389
00:17:21.417 --> 00:17:22.936
<i>Don't listen to that guy.</i>

390
00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:26.295
He's trying to lead you
down the path of righteousness.

391
00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:29.053
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

392
00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:31.093
- Oh, come off it.
- You come off it!

393
00:17:31.212 --> 00:17:32.172
- You.
- You.

394
00:17:32.212 --> 00:17:33.451
- You.
- You infinity.

395
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:34.452
Uhh!

396
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:36.530
Listen up, big guy.

397
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.090
I got three good reasons why
you should just walk away.

398
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:40.928
Number one... Look at that guy!

399
00:17:40.968 --> 00:17:43.127
He's got that sissy stringy music thing.

400
00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:45.926
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.

401
00:17:45.967 --> 00:17:48.286
Oh, right. That's a harp...

402
00:17:48.325 --> 00:17:49.444
And that's a dress.

403
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:50.725
Robe!

404
00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:52.284
Reason number 2.

405
00:17:52.323 --> 00:17:54.283
Look what I can do.

406
00:17:54.363 --> 00:17:56.442
But, what does that
have to do with anything?

407
00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:58.522
No, no. He's got a point.

408
00:17:58.562 --> 00:17:59.961
Listen, you guys.

409
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.719
You're sort of confusing me, so begone!

410
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.758
Uh, or, uh, you know.
However I get rid of you guys.

411
00:18:05.798 --> 00:18:07.438
that'll work.

412
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.668
<i>Um,
what's with the chimp and the bug?</i>

413
00:18:29.748 --> 00:18:31.147
<i>Can we get back to me?</i>

414
00:18:32.827 --> 00:18:35.225
Oh, boy. Think, think, think.

415
00:18:35.305 --> 00:18:38.345
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?

416
00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.742
What am I gonna tell the village?

417
00:18:47.381 --> 00:18:49.220
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. Okay.

418
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.579
What do I do? What do I do?

419
00:18:50.659 --> 00:18:51.858
Aah!

420
00:18:56.257 --> 00:18:57.576
Back! Elbow! Shoulder!

421
00:18:57.616 --> 00:18:58.815
Ugh!

422
00:19:05.614 --> 00:19:08.652
Oh, hey! Hey, you!
Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me.

423
00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.730
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

424
00:19:10.811 --> 00:19:12.450
comin' through. Hey, you with the cart!

425
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.250
Uh-oh!

426
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:16.448
This is not good.

427
00:19:16.528 --> 00:19:19.327
Uhh. Hope that doesn't come back
to haunt me.

428
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.546
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!

429
00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:12.745
Measure me again!

430
00:20:12.824 --> 00:20:15.624
All right, TIPO.
Stand still and let's see.

431
00:20:15.784 --> 00:20:18.222
Mom, you and I both know
that it's impossible for him

432
00:20:18.302 --> 00:20:20.182
- to have grown in the last five minutes.
- Mmm! Mmm!

433
00:20:21.381 --> 00:20:22.540
Isn't it?

434
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.540
Look how much you've grown!

435
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.939
What? TIPO, get out of the way.
It's my turn again. Measure me.

436
00:20:28.658 --> 00:20:29.857
Dad's home!

437
00:20:31.258 --> 00:20:33.376
Hey!

438
00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:35.055
Come here.

439
00:20:37.854 --> 00:20:39.454
Dad! I ate a bug today!

440
00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:41.173
Oh! Was Mom baking again?

441
00:20:41.213 --> 00:20:42.652
Heh. Don't tell her I said that.

442
00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:44.012
I heard that.

443
00:20:44.092 --> 00:20:45.731
Okay, everybody, move aside.

444
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.450
Lady with a baby comin' through.

445
00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:51.088
Dad, Dad, Dad! Look at how big I am!

446
00:20:51.128 --> 00:20:52.568
We were all measured today.

447
00:20:52.648 --> 00:20:53.608
Oh.

448
00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:54.967
I'm going through a growth spurt.

449
00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:57.047
I'm as big as you were
when you were me.

450
00:20:57.126 --> 00:20:58.485
Mmm-hmm. Sure are.

451
00:20:58.566 --> 00:21:01.285
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

452
00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.403
Okay, okay, you two.

453
00:21:04.484 --> 00:21:07.401
Our deal was that you could stay awake
until Daddy came home.

454
00:21:07.442 --> 00:21:09.201
Now say good night.

455
00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.360
Dad, do we have to?

456
00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:16.718
No, you two can stay up.

457
00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:18.517
We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

458
00:21:18.598 --> 00:21:20.156
how much we love each other.

459
00:21:20.236 --> 00:21:22.195
Right, honey?

460
00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:23.275
- Ew!
- Blecch!

461
00:21:23.355 --> 00:21:24.554
Good night.

462
00:21:25.194 --> 00:21:27.194
So what did the emperor want?

463
00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:28.233
Ahem.

464
00:21:28.313 --> 00:21:30.472
You know what? He couldn't see me.

465
00:21:30.513 --> 00:21:32.831
- Couldn't see you? Why not?
- I don't know.

466
00:21:32.871 --> 00:21:34.311
Well, that's just rude.

467
00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:36.429
Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.

468
00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:37.510
No, no, no, no. No.

469
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:40.108
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

470
00:21:40.188 --> 00:21:41.308
Honey...

471
00:21:41.348 --> 00:21:42.787
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

472
00:21:42.827 --> 00:21:44.227
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

473
00:21:44.306 --> 00:21:46.226
Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.

474
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.824
Pacha, I'm fine.
This baby's not coming for a while,

475
00:21:48.864 --> 00:21:51.903
but even if it was,
I'd give that guy a piece of my mind.

476
00:21:51.983 --> 00:21:53.743
That kind of behaviour just...

477
00:21:53.863 --> 00:21:54.942
Uhh!

478
00:21:55.821 --> 00:21:57.501
I gotta go wash something.

479
00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:14.654
Pacha? You okay?

480
00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:15.894
Hmm?

481
00:22:15.973 --> 00:22:18.131
Oh, yeah.
I'm just a little tired from the trip.

482
00:22:18.613 --> 00:22:19.572
Um...

483
00:22:20.012 --> 00:22:21.890
I'm gonna go put Misty away.

484
00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:35.646
Hi. Excuse me.

485
00:22:35.725 --> 00:22:36.764
Two seconds here.

486
00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:38.723
Um, I'm the one in the cart. Remember?

487
00:22:38.763 --> 00:22:41.322
This story's about me, not him.

488
00:22:41.802 --> 00:22:43.043
Okay. You got it? All right.

489
00:22:43.082 --> 00:22:45.001
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.

490
00:22:55.637 --> 00:22:56.597
Huh?

491
00:22:59.075 --> 00:23:00.035
Whoa!

492
00:23:00.115 --> 00:23:02.514
Uh. Oh...

493
00:23:02.593 --> 00:23:04.513
Where'd you come from, little guy?

494
00:23:04.593 --> 00:23:06.272
No touchy.

495
00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:08.112
Aah! Demon llama!

496
00:23:08.192 --> 00:23:09.551
Demon llama? Where?

497
00:23:09.631 --> 00:23:10.590
- Aah!
- Aah!

498
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.388
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

499
00:23:15.508 --> 00:23:17.947
Ow! My head.

500
00:23:18.027 --> 00:23:21.186
Okay, demon llama. Just take it easy.

501
00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:23.984
I mean you no harm.

502
00:23:24.025 --> 00:23:25.624
What are you talking about...

503
00:23:25.984 --> 00:23:27.782
Oh, wait. I know you.

504
00:23:27.863 --> 00:23:29.142
You're that whiny peasant.

505
00:23:29.262 --> 00:23:32.021
Emperor KUZCO?

506
00:23:32.101 --> 00:23:33.981
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

507
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.180
Uh. How did... Um.

508
00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:39.658
You don't...

509
00:23:39.697 --> 00:23:41.177
Look like the emperor.

510
00:23:41.258 --> 00:23:42.777
What do you mean
I don't look like the emperor?

511
00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.215
Uh... Oh...

512
00:23:44.296 --> 00:23:45.616
Do this...

513
00:23:45.656 --> 00:23:48.853
What is this, some kind of little game
you country folk like to...

514
00:23:48.934 --> 00:23:50.574
It can't be! Aah!

515
00:23:52.012 --> 00:23:53.333
Aah! Aah!

516
00:23:53.412 --> 00:23:56.410
My face! Aah!
My beautiful, beautiful face!

517
00:23:56.491 --> 00:23:58.530
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I'm an ugly, stinky llama!

518
00:23:58.571 --> 00:24:00.009
Wait, okay, Your Majesty.

519
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:01.369
Llama face!

520
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.168
What happened?

521
00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:06.207
I'm tr yin' to figure that out, okay?

522
00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:12.524
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.

523
00:24:12.604 --> 00:24:13.804
Wait a minute.

524
00:24:13.884 --> 00:24:15.243
I remember you.

525
00:24:15.323 --> 00:24:17.602
I remember telling you
that I was building my pool

526
00:24:17.681 --> 00:24:20.641
where your house was,
and then you got mad at me.

527
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.640
Oh!

528
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:24.080
And you turned me into a llama!

529
00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:26.038
What? No, I did not.

530
00:24:26.078 --> 00:24:27.718
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.

531
00:24:27.798 --> 00:24:29.237
Why would I kidnap a llama?

532
00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:32.276
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.

533
00:24:32.316 --> 00:24:33.515
What?

534
00:24:33.595 --> 00:24:37.194
Hmm. You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit.

535
00:24:37.673 --> 00:24:39.833
Okay. I have to get back to the palace.

536
00:24:39.913 --> 00:24:43.032
Yzma's got that "secret lab."

537
00:24:43.072 --> 00:24:45.830
I'll just snap my fingers
and order her to change me back.

538
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.629
Hey, you. No time to waste. Let's go.

539
00:24:51.868 --> 00:24:55.427
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you? Now let's go.

540
00:24:57.905 --> 00:25:00.225
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

541
00:25:00.784 --> 00:25:03.022
You want to run that by me again?

542
00:25:04.702 --> 00:25:07.741
I can't let you go back
unless you change your mind

543
00:25:07.821 --> 00:25:10.299
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

544
00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:15.417
Hmm. I got a little secret for you.
Come here. No, closer.

545
00:25:16.218 --> 00:25:18.416
I don't make deals with peasants!

546
00:25:19.056 --> 00:25:21.615
Then I guess I can't take you back.

547
00:25:21.695 --> 00:25:23.295
Fine. I don't need you.

548
00:25:23.334 --> 00:25:24.934
I can find my own way back.

549
00:25:24.974 --> 00:25:26.133
I wouldn't recommend it.

550
00:25:26.213 --> 00:25:28.333
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

551
00:25:28.413 --> 00:25:29.572
Nice try, pal.

552
00:25:29.652 --> 00:25:31.530
No, really. I'm telling you,
there are jaguars and snakes

553
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.610
- And quicksand.
- I'm not listening.

554
00:25:34.689 --> 00:25:37.288
I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.

555
00:25:37.409 --> 00:25:39.527
Oh. Heh.

556
00:25:39.608 --> 00:25:41.487
Still not listening.

557
00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:43.126
Ah, you...

558
00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:44.726
Fine. Fine.

559
00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:46.046
Go ahead!

560
00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:50.043
If there's no KUZCO,
there's no Kuzcotopia.

561
00:25:50.083 --> 00:25:51.722
Takes care of my problem.

562
00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.480
Hmm.

563
00:26:06.437 --> 00:26:07.916
Scary jungle. Right.

564
00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:11.075
Oh, a leaf. Oh, it might attack me.

565
00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:12.434
Oh! It's a scary tree.

566
00:26:12.474 --> 00:26:14.673
I'm afraid. Ha ha.

567
00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:18.751
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such,

568
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:21.510
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

569
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.709
Okay, where am I?

570
00:26:27.907 --> 00:26:28.867
What...

571
00:26:28.907 --> 00:26:30.906
Help me! Help me!

572
00:26:30.987 --> 00:26:32.545
Help me! Ohh!

573
00:26:32.905 --> 00:26:34.625
Uhh.

574
00:26:35.144 --> 00:26:36.264
Too late.

575
00:26:36.983 --> 00:26:39.583
Okay, that was the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

576
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:45.660
Aah!

577
00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.058
What do you want?

578
00:26:50.497 --> 00:26:51.778
Oh, for me?

579
00:26:51.858 --> 00:26:53.576
Why, I don't know what to say.

580
00:26:55.176 --> 00:26:56.176
Ow!

581
00:26:56.255 --> 00:26:57.494
Hit the road, Bucky.

582
00:27:00.374 --> 00:27:02.253
Aah! Ow!

583
00:27:02.813 --> 00:27:03.773
Huh?

584
00:27:04.013 --> 00:27:05.052
Huh?

585
00:27:07.052 --> 00:27:08.011
Huh?

586
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.170
Uh-oh.

587
00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:20.805
No, no. No, no, no, no.

588
00:27:20.886 --> 00:27:21.845
No, no. No, don't.

589
00:27:27.522 --> 00:27:28.482
Ha!

590
00:27:33.241 --> 00:27:34.760
No!

591
00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:46.075
Aah!

592
00:27:52.392 --> 00:27:54.951
You killer jaguars...

593
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:56.911
Whoa!

594
00:28:12.583 --> 00:28:13.664
Aah!

595
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.020
Don't worry, Your Highness. I gotcha.
You're safe now.

596
00:28:26.458 --> 00:28:29.016
Maybe I'm just new
to this whole rescuing thing,

597
00:28:29.096 --> 00:28:30.537
but this, to me,

598
00:28:30.616 --> 00:28:32.575
might be considered
kind of a step backwards,

599
00:28:32.655 --> 00:28:34.775
- wouldn't you say?
- No, no, no. It's okay.

600
00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:36.053
This is all right.

601
00:28:36.093 --> 00:28:37.572
We can figure this out.

602
00:28:39.453 --> 00:28:40.532
I hate you.

603
00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:44.490
No!

604
00:28:45.569 --> 00:28:46.929
Aah! Ow!

605
00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:55.606
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

606
00:28:56.005 --> 00:28:57.924
Aah! Ow!

607
00:28:58.605 --> 00:28:59.564
Ow!

608
00:29:00.244 --> 00:29:01.203
Uhh!

609
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.239
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting all funned out.

610
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.439
Uh-oh.

611
00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:13.598
Don't tell me.
We're about to go over a huge waterfall.

612
00:29:13.637 --> 00:29:15.318
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?

613
00:29:15.397 --> 00:29:16.877
Most likely.

614
00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:17.956
Bring it on.

615
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:19.836
Boo-yah!

616
00:29:20.675 --> 00:29:21.675
Whoo!

617
00:29:48.824 --> 00:29:50.382
Your Highness.

618
00:29:50.422 --> 00:29:52.021
Your Highness, can you hear me?

619
00:29:52.862 --> 00:29:54.981
Oh, boy. Come on, breathe.

620
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.619
Breathe!

621
00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:00.299
Ohh. Why me?

622
00:30:07.375 --> 00:30:08.334
Ugh!

623
00:30:08.535 --> 00:30:09.615
All right.

624
00:30:12.613 --> 00:30:13.733
- Ohh!
- Aah!

625
00:30:17.251 --> 00:30:18.331
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

626
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.647
For the last time, it was not a kiss.

627
00:30:25.328 --> 00:30:26.808
Well, whatever you call it...

628
00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:29.647
It was disgusting.

629
00:30:29.726 --> 00:30:32.324
And if you would've done what
I ordered you to do in the first place,

630
00:30:32.365 --> 00:30:35.364
we all could've been spared
your little kiss of life.

631
00:30:36.643 --> 00:30:37.603
Aw!

632
00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:41.161
But now that you're here,
you will take me back to the palace.

633
00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:42.720
I'll have YZMA change me back,

634
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:45.639
and then I'll start construction
on Kuzcotopia.

635
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.759
Oh, yeah.

636
00:30:47.199 --> 00:30:50.198
<i>Okay, now, look,
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.</i>

637
00:30:50.518 --> 00:30:51.877
Mmm-hmm.

638
00:30:51.957 --> 00:30:54.077
I just think if you really thought about it,

639
00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:56.594
you'd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop.

640
00:30:56.635 --> 00:30:58.074
And why would I do that?

641
00:30:59.313 --> 00:31:00.952
Because...

642
00:31:01.033 --> 00:31:02.433
Deep down, I think you'll realise

643
00:31:02.513 --> 00:31:05.950
that you're forcing an entire village
out of their homes just for you.

644
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.990
And that's...

645
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:09.589
Bad?

646
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:10.989
Well, yeah.

647
00:31:11.988 --> 00:31:14.267
Nobody's that heartless.

648
00:31:14.347 --> 00:31:15.307
Mmm.

649
00:31:16.506 --> 00:31:17.705
Now take me back.

650
00:31:17.746 --> 00:31:20.185
What? Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?

651
00:31:20.265 --> 00:31:22.104
All you care about
is building your summer home

652
00:31:22.184 --> 00:31:23.664
and filling it with stuff for you.

653
00:31:23.743 --> 00:31:25.583
Uh, yeah. Doy. Me.

654
00:31:25.662 --> 00:31:27.502
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.

655
00:31:27.582 --> 00:31:29.861
You're the only one that doesn't
seem to be with the program me,

656
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.420
eh, Pacha?

657
00:31:31.501 --> 00:31:34.458
You know what? Someday,
you're going to wind up all alone,

658
00:31:34.538 --> 00:31:36.658
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

659
00:31:37.218 --> 00:31:38.897
Thanks for that. I'll log that away.

660
00:31:38.976 --> 00:31:42.575
Now, for the final time, I order you
to take me back to the palace.

661
00:31:43.215 --> 00:31:45.335
Looks to me like you're stuck out here,

662
00:31:45.414 --> 00:31:48.013
because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

663
00:31:50.932 --> 00:31:52.452
Because unless
you change your mind,

664
00:31:52.531 --> 00:31:53.730
I'm not taking you back.

665
00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.529
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.

666
00:31:57.209 --> 00:32:00.368
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything. I didn't...

667
00:32:00.448 --> 00:32:02.087
Somebody's throwing stuff.

668
00:32:02.167 --> 00:32:03.966
You going to build a fire or what?
What's going on?

669
00:32:04.527 --> 00:32:07.285
He's never going to change his mind.

670
00:32:09.244 --> 00:32:11.563
How am I ever going to get out of here?

671
00:32:38.672 --> 00:32:40.351
And so, it is with great sadness

672
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:45.869
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince...

673
00:32:47.068 --> 00:32:49.107
Taken from us so tragically

674
00:32:49.187 --> 00:32:51.986
on the very eve of his 18th birthday.

675
00:32:52.066 --> 00:32:53.265
Poor little guy.

676
00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:55.465
His legacy will live on in our hearts...

677
00:32:55.545 --> 00:32:56.744
He never had a chance.

678
00:32:56.784 --> 00:32:58.664
For all eternity.

679
00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:03.182
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.

680
00:33:03.262 --> 00:33:04.621
Back to work.

681
00:33:17.176 --> 00:33:18.696
Kronk, darlin',

682
00:33:18.775 --> 00:33:22.894
I must admit you had me worried
when you mixed up those poisons,

683
00:33:22.973 --> 00:33:27.172
but now that KUZCO is dead,
all is forgiven.

684
00:33:27.252 --> 00:33:28.891
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's...

685
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.970
He's dead, all right.

686
00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:34.969
I mean, you can't get much deader
than he... than he is right now.

687
00:33:35.009 --> 00:33:36.648
Unless, of course, we killed him again.

688
00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:39.647
I suppose.

689
00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:41.925
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.

690
00:33:43.086 --> 00:33:44.644
Kronk...

691
00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:46.283
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

692
00:33:46.323 --> 00:33:47.324
Kronk...

693
00:33:47.403 --> 00:33:49.362
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.

694
00:33:49.602 --> 00:33:53.121
- Ahh!
- KUZCO is dead, right?

695
00:33:53.201 --> 00:33:54.600
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

696
00:33:54.639 --> 00:33:57.838
I need to hear these words.

697
00:33:57.879 --> 00:34:00.118
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

698
00:34:00.558 --> 00:34:02.117
He's still alive?

699
00:34:02.157 --> 00:34:04.357
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

700
00:34:04.396 --> 00:34:05.955
Kronk...

701
00:34:05.996 --> 00:34:09.194
I just thought I'd give you the heads-up
in case KUZCO ever came back.

702
00:34:09.274 --> 00:34:10.913
He can't come back!

703
00:34:10.952 --> 00:34:14.871
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward,
especially after that lovely eulogy.

704
00:34:14.951 --> 00:34:16.392
You think?

705
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:20.230
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!

706
00:34:20.269 --> 00:34:21.909
Now let's move!

707
00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:22.988
Dad, look out!

708
00:34:24.348 --> 00:34:25.907
TIPO, what is it?

709
00:34:25.987 --> 00:34:28.026
I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log

710
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:31.744
and was careening out of control
down a raging river of death!

711
00:34:31.784 --> 00:34:33.184
All right, all right, it's okay.

712
00:34:33.264 --> 00:34:35.902
- It was awful!
- It's okay, it's okay. TIPO, calm down.

713
00:34:35.942 --> 00:34:37.462
It was just a dream.

714
00:34:37.503 --> 00:34:40.020
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.

715
00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:42.899
Oh.

716
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.539
Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.

717
00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:46.658
That's right.

718
00:34:46.738 --> 00:34:48.537
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

719
00:34:48.617 --> 00:34:50.497
Yeah, like that would ever happen.

720
00:34:50.576 --> 00:34:52.136
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.

721
00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:53.376
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

722
00:34:53.496 --> 00:34:54.775
Yeah-huh.

723
00:34:57.013 --> 00:34:58.133
Good night, you two.

724
00:34:58.174 --> 00:34:59.133
Night, Mom!

725
00:35:10.448 --> 00:35:11.407
Brr!

726
00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:13.007
Uh, hey.

727
00:35:17.844 --> 00:35:18.925
Thanks.

728
00:35:19.045 --> 00:35:20.004
Oh.

729
00:35:21.124 --> 00:35:22.484
No problem.

730
00:35:24.123 --> 00:35:25.322
Feels like wool.

731
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:26.722
Yeah.

732
00:35:26.761 --> 00:35:27.921
Alpaca?

733
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:29.320
Oh, yeah, it is.

734
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.680
Oh, yeah, I thought so.

735
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.279
It's nice.

736
00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:34.799
My wife made it.

737
00:35:34.878 --> 00:35:36.038
Oh, she knits?

738
00:35:36.077 --> 00:35:37.677
Crochets.

739
00:35:37.756 --> 00:35:39.876
Crochets? Nice.

740
00:35:39.956 --> 00:35:41.155
Thanks.

741
00:35:46.993 --> 00:35:48.712
So...

742
00:35:48.792 --> 00:35:52.830
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

743
00:35:52.911 --> 00:35:54.110
we'd...

744
00:35:54.189 --> 00:35:57.869
I mean, there's lots of hilltops,
and maybe I might, you know...

745
00:35:57.948 --> 00:35:59.147
I might...

746
00:35:59.229 --> 00:36:01.986
Are you saying...

747
00:36:02.066 --> 00:36:03.546
You've changed your mind?

748
00:36:03.627 --> 00:36:05.266
Oh, well, I...

749
00:36:05.305 --> 00:36:09.583
Because you know that means you're
doing something nice for someone else.

750
00:36:09.624 --> 00:36:11.342
No, I know that. I know.

751
00:36:11.382 --> 00:36:13.382
And you're all right with that?

752
00:36:13.462 --> 00:36:14.701
Yes.

753
00:36:20.419 --> 00:36:21.738
What?

754
00:36:24.258 --> 00:36:26.616
Don't shake unless you mean it.

755
00:36:34.013 --> 00:36:35.372
All right.

756
00:36:37.012 --> 00:36:39.531
Let's get you back to the palace.

757
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.330
Oh, by the way, thanks.

758
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:43.849
No...

759
00:36:43.929 --> 00:36:45.569
Thank you.

760
00:36:57.604 --> 00:36:59.322
Okay.
Once we cross this bridge,

761
00:36:59.363 --> 00:37:00.722
it's only an hour to the palace.

762
00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:03.041
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.

763
00:37:03.081 --> 00:37:04.120
I believe it.

764
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.401
- What was that?
- Nothing.

765
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.800
Ohh!

766
00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.599
Whoa!

767
00:37:08.638 --> 00:37:09.718
KUZCO!

768
00:37:11.198 --> 00:37:12.717
KUZCO!

769
00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.317
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!

770
00:37:15.996 --> 00:37:17.875
No. I don't think I will.

771
00:37:17.916 --> 00:37:19.115
You're going to leave me here?

772
00:37:19.194 --> 00:37:21.353
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

773
00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:23.033
but I kind of like this better.

774
00:37:23.073 --> 00:37:24.632
I thought you were a changed man.

775
00:37:24.712 --> 00:37:27.990
Oh, come on. I had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city.

776
00:37:28.071 --> 00:37:29.749
So all of it was a lie?

777
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.829
Well, yeah. No, wait.

778
00:37:33.707 --> 00:37:35.827
Uh, yeah, yeah. It all was a lie.

779
00:37:35.907 --> 00:37:37.107
Toodles.

780
00:37:37.146 --> 00:37:39.346
We shook hands on it!

781
00:37:42.705 --> 00:37:45.463
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

782
00:37:45.543 --> 00:37:47.063
You need hands.

783
00:37:47.302 --> 00:37:49.861
Ha. Okay. Buh-bye.

784
00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:50.861
Ah!

785
00:37:51.461 --> 00:37:53.420
Are you okay? Are you all right?

786
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.499
Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm all right.

787
00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.098
Good!

788
00:37:57.178 --> 00:37:59.057
That's for going back on your promise!

789
00:38:00.257 --> 00:38:03.496
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me
and taking me to your village...

790
00:38:03.576 --> 00:38:06.334
Which I'm still gonna destroy,
by the way.

791
00:38:06.374 --> 00:38:07.415
No touchy.

792
00:38:07.494 --> 00:38:08.454
Ohh!

793
00:38:08.533 --> 00:38:11.172
Why did I risk my life
for a selfish brat like you?

794
00:38:11.212 --> 00:38:12.931
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

795
00:38:13.012 --> 00:38:14.491
but, oh, you proved me wrong.

796
00:38:14.531 --> 00:38:17.729
Oh, boo-hoo.
Now I feel really bad. Bad llama.

797
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.489
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

798
00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:21.328
and then all my problems
would be over.

799
00:38:21.408 --> 00:38:23.407
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.

800
00:38:23.487 --> 00:38:24.887
Let's end this.

801
00:38:24.927 --> 00:38:25.926
Ladies first.

802
00:38:26.006 --> 00:38:27.085
Aah!

803
00:38:36.482 --> 00:38:37.441
Ohh!

804
00:38:43.478 --> 00:38:45.558
Ow! Ow!

805
00:38:46.517 --> 00:38:47.477
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

806
00:38:51.315 --> 00:38:52.596
What are we gonna do?

807
00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:54.034
Aah!

808
00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:56.273
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

809
00:38:56.313 --> 00:38:59.432
We're gonna die! That's it for me!

810
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:01.952
No, we're not. Calm down.

811
00:39:02.031 --> 00:39:05.070
I have an idea. Give me your arm.

812
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.468
Okay, now the other one.

813
00:39:08.748 --> 00:39:11.467
When I say go, push against my back,

814
00:39:11.547 --> 00:39:14.506
and we'll walk up the hill. Ready?

815
00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:15.546
Go.

816
00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:18.145
Ow! You did that on purpose.

817
00:39:18.545 --> 00:39:20.902
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!

818
00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:24.221
Now, we're gonna have to work together
to get out of this, so follow my lead.

819
00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:25.381
Ready?

820
00:39:25.461 --> 00:39:26.621
- Right foot.
- Whose right?

821
00:39:26.661 --> 00:39:28.100
Your right or mine?

822
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.380
I don't care. Mine.

823
00:39:29.459 --> 00:39:30.499
Well, why yours?

824
00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:31.699
Okay, your right! Ready?

825
00:39:31.778 --> 00:39:34.258
- Okay, got it.
- Okay, right.

826
00:39:34.337 --> 00:39:35.937
Left. Right.

827
00:39:36.097 --> 00:39:38.696
Look, we're moving!

828
00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.175
Aah!

829
00:39:40.255 --> 00:39:43.134
Don't look down! Now, stay with me.
Stay with me.

830
00:39:43.174 --> 00:39:48.372
Right. Left.

831
00:39:48.412 --> 00:39:50.010
Right!

832
00:39:50.451 --> 00:39:53.009
Now what, genius?

833
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.890
Working on it.

834
00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:56.968
Okay, here's the deal.

835
00:39:57.048 --> 00:40:00.087
Stretch out your neck,
and I'll grab the rope.

836
00:40:00.126 --> 00:40:02.806
How do I know you won't let me fall
after you grab the rope?

837
00:40:02.846 --> 00:40:05.764
You're just gonna have to trust me!

838
00:40:08.444 --> 00:40:11.362
You know, it's a good thing
you're not a big, fat guy,

839
00:40:11.443 --> 00:40:13.641
or this would be really difficult.

840
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:16.720
Almost.

841
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.159
Got it!

842
00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:20.239
It's stuck.

843
00:40:20.278 --> 00:40:22.197
Take your time. No hurry here.

844
00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:25.956
Scorpions!

845
00:40:25.996 --> 00:40:27.075
KUZCO!

846
00:40:27.115 --> 00:40:28.115
Aah!

847
00:40:28.435 --> 00:40:29.514
Oh, no!

848
00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:36.792
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

849
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.111
Huh?

850
00:40:44.748 --> 00:40:46.507
Whoa!

851
00:40:55.943 --> 00:40:57.103
Huh?

852
00:40:58.183 --> 00:40:59.781
Look out!

853
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:02.141
Ohh.

854
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.579
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Ooh, look at me and my bad self.

855
00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:09.378
I snatched you right out of the air.

856
00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:12.696
"Ooh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall,
and I'm taking you with me."

857
00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.455
Well, not today, pal. Uh-huh.

858
00:41:14.936 --> 00:41:16.214
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

859
00:41:17.294 --> 00:41:19.253
You just saved my life.

860
00:41:19.613 --> 00:41:20.572
Huh?

861
00:41:21.733 --> 00:41:22.732
So?

862
00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:23.972
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

863
00:41:24.051 --> 00:41:25.411
That there is some good in you after all.

864
00:41:25.492 --> 00:41:26.571
- Oh, no.
- Admit it.

865
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:27.569
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

866
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:28.889
- Nuh-huh.
- I think there is.

867
00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:30.569
- Nuh-huh.
- Hey, you could've let me fall.

868
00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:33.408
Come on, what's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless.

869
00:41:35.447 --> 00:41:38.486
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.

870
00:41:38.926 --> 00:41:41.004
Right. Sure.

871
00:41:41.084 --> 00:41:43.004
Well, we better get going.

872
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:46.283
With that bridge out,
it's a four-day walk to the palace.

873
00:41:46.362 --> 00:41:48.681
What?
You mean you're still taking me back?

874
00:41:48.761 --> 00:41:50.161
I shook on it, didn't I?

875
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:53.679
Well, yeah, but I hope you realise
that doesn't change a thing.

876
00:41:53.758 --> 00:41:56.478
I'm still building Kuzcotopia
when I get back.

877
00:41:56.517 --> 00:41:58.117
Well, four days is a long time.

878
00:41:58.198 --> 00:41:59.997
Who knows?
Maybe you'll change your mind.

879
00:42:00.116 --> 00:42:01.076
Uh-huh.

880
00:42:01.236 --> 00:42:02.436
Four days.

881
00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:04.235
What are the chances
of you carrying me?

882
00:42:04.314 --> 00:42:05.673
Not good.

883
00:42:07.834 --> 00:42:09.112
No, no, no!

884
00:42:10.032 --> 00:42:12.232
We've searched every village
surrounding the palace

885
00:42:12.311 --> 00:42:14.230
and still no sign of KUZCO.

886
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.350
Where is he?

887
00:42:16.509 --> 00:42:17.468
Kronk!

888
00:42:17.549 --> 00:42:18.508
Kronk here.

889
00:42:18.588 --> 00:42:20.508
I'm getting tired. Pull over.

890
00:42:20.588 --> 00:42:21.867
Sure thing. Kronk out.

891
00:42:26.664 --> 00:42:27.825
Ooh! Aah!

892
00:42:28.105 --> 00:42:29.264
Aah! Ohh!

893
00:42:33.102 --> 00:42:34.262
Perfect.

894
00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:36.981
These are my best shoes.

895
00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:41.219
I hate this jungle.

896
00:42:42.898 --> 00:42:44.019
Oh, look.

897
00:42:44.058 --> 00:42:46.017
A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

898
00:42:46.097 --> 00:42:48.697
- Just one more for exotic bird bingo.
- Ahh!

899
00:42:48.776 --> 00:42:50.615
- I am loving this.
- Ahh!

900
00:42:58.731 --> 00:43:00.411
Get away from me!

901
00:43:03.689 --> 00:43:04.809
Yeah. Tell me about it.

902
00:43:06.608 --> 00:43:08.047
No, no, it's not you.

903
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:10.247
She's not the easiest person
to get close to.

904
00:43:10.327 --> 00:43:12.246
There's a wall there. Trust me.

905
00:43:12.325 --> 00:43:14.805
Are you talking to that squirrel?

906
00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:16.684
I was a Junior Chipmunk.

907
00:43:16.765 --> 00:43:19.323
I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

908
00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:20.482
Please continue.

909
00:43:22.802 --> 00:43:26.600
Aah! Why me? Why me?

910
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.039
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

911
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.878
This poor little guy has had it rough.

912
00:43:30.919 --> 00:43:33.757
Seems a talking llama
gave him a hard time the other day.

913
00:43:34.157 --> 00:43:35.157
Oh.

914
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:37.916
A talking llama? Do tell.

915
00:43:40.953 --> 00:43:43.233
Uh, he doesn't really want to talk to you.

916
00:43:43.313 --> 00:43:45.351
Well, then you ask him.

917
00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:47.512
I hate being in the middle.

918
00:43:47.711 --> 00:43:48.910
Squeaky,

919
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.550
squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.

920
00:43:53.428 --> 00:43:55.468
Jaguars? No kidding? Brutal.

921
00:44:02.105 --> 00:44:04.864
Uh, could you give us a little room here?

922
00:44:04.943 --> 00:44:06.144
Oh, sorry.

923
00:44:08.382 --> 00:44:09.702
A little bit more, please.

924
00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:12.780
How is this?

925
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:14.020
Yeah, that's good.

926
00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.618
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

927
00:44:17.778 --> 00:44:19.818
Squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.

928
00:44:31.973 --> 00:44:33.173
Low blood sugar, huh?

929
00:44:33.252 --> 00:44:34.851
Yeah. It's a curse.

930
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:36.331
Well, as soon as we get
something to eat,

931
00:44:36.411 --> 00:44:38.010
you're walking the rest of the way.

932
00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:52.485
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut,
home of the mug...

933
00:44:54.923 --> 00:44:57.762
- Of meat. what'll it be?
- Ahem.

934
00:44:58.242 --> 00:45:01.560
We'll have two specials.
Is that all right, dear?

935
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.679
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

936
00:45:05.159 --> 00:45:06.598
We're on our honeymoon.

937
00:45:06.678 --> 00:45:08.997
Bless you for coming out in public.

938
00:45:09.597 --> 00:45:11.755
So that's two specials.

939
00:45:11.796 --> 00:45:14.195
And an onion log. To split.

940
00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:21.192
Ordering! I need two heartburns
and a deep-fried doorstop on table 12!

941
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.990
Okay,
so I'll admit this was a good idea.

942
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.830
When will you learn
that all my ideas are good ones?

943
00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:29.909
That's funny,

944
00:45:29.988 --> 00:45:32.187
because I thought you going
into the jungle by yourself,

945
00:45:32.267 --> 00:45:33.827
being chased by jaguars,

946
00:45:33.867 --> 00:45:35.746
lying to me
to take you back to the palace

947
00:45:35.786 --> 00:45:36.986
were all really bad ideas.

948
00:45:37.065 --> 00:45:39.943
Oh, yeah, anything sounds bad
when you say it with that attitude.

949
00:45:40.344 --> 00:45:44.102
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

950
00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:45.902
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

951
00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.860
Oh, boy.

952
00:45:52.418 --> 00:45:53.419
Ooh. Ugh.

953
00:45:57.857 --> 00:46:00.535
Oh, here.
Let me get that for you.

954
00:46:03.814 --> 00:46:04.813
Where are you going?

955
00:46:04.893 --> 00:46:07.133
I'm just going to slip into the kitchen
and have a word with the chef.

956
00:46:07.213 --> 00:46:08.652
You're gonna get us thrown out.

957
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:12.131
Please. With this disguise, I'm invisible.

958
00:46:17.049 --> 00:46:18.008
Heh.

959
00:46:19.008 --> 00:46:21.526
We've been walking around in circles
for who knows how long.

960
00:46:21.607 --> 00:46:25.245
That is the last time
we take directions from a squirrel.

961
00:46:25.324 --> 00:46:28.804
I should have done away with KUZCO
myself when I had the chance.

962
00:46:31.283 --> 00:46:33.642
Oh, you really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

963
00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:38.519
Uh-oh.
I'll get you another one there, YZMA.

964
00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:40.998
You using that fork there, pal?

965
00:46:41.479 --> 00:46:42.678
Hey, don't I know you?

966
00:46:42.757 --> 00:46:43.837
I don't think so.

967
00:46:43.918 --> 00:46:46.116
- Wrestled you in high school?
- Don't remember that.

968
00:46:46.156 --> 00:46:47.436
Metal shop? I got it!

969
00:46:47.517 --> 00:46:49.675
Miss Narca's interpretive dance,
two semesters.

970
00:46:49.754 --> 00:46:51.755
I was usually in the back
because of my weak ankles.

971
00:46:51.794 --> 00:46:53.873
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

972
00:46:53.953 --> 00:46:56.712
I don't think we've ever met,
but I gotta go.

973
00:46:56.792 --> 00:46:57.991
Don't worry. I'll think of it.

974
00:46:58.072 --> 00:47:00.310
Look, all I know is the food looked iffy.

975
00:47:00.391 --> 00:47:02.229
I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

976
00:47:02.509 --> 00:47:03.469
Psst. Hey!

977
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.228
So I'm just checking to make sure

978
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:07.108
you're going to take
the main course up a notch.

979
00:47:07.147 --> 00:47:10.666
Is there anything on this menu
that is not swimming in gravy?

980
00:47:10.746 --> 00:47:12.106
Hang on. I'll go ask the chef.

981
00:47:12.186 --> 00:47:13.305
It's a simple question.

982
00:47:13.345 --> 00:47:15.904
Is there or is there not anything edible

983
00:47:15.984 --> 00:47:17.183
- on this menu?
- Gah!

984
00:47:19.662 --> 00:47:21.462
Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!

985
00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:24.420
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

986
00:47:24.501 --> 00:47:26.300
All right, buster, that's it!

987
00:47:26.339 --> 00:47:28.739
You want a special order,
then you make it! I quit!

988
00:47:28.819 --> 00:47:29.818
Yeah, but I...

989
00:47:29.858 --> 00:47:33.456
I try and I try, but there's no respect
for anyone with vision. That's it!

990
00:47:33.497 --> 00:47:35.016
There's just nothing I can do about it!

991
00:47:35.296 --> 00:47:36.375
Please don't go.

992
00:47:36.456 --> 00:47:38.615
Three pork combos,
extra bacon on the side,

993
00:47:38.694 --> 00:47:41.533
two chilli cheese samplers,
a basket of liver and onion rings,

994
00:47:41.613 --> 00:47:44.451
a catch of the day,
and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.

995
00:47:45.531 --> 00:47:46.611
You got all that, honey?

996
00:47:46.651 --> 00:47:48.370
Three oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air,

997
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:51.009
basket of grandma's breakfast,
and change the bull to a gill, got it.

998
00:47:51.089 --> 00:47:52.168
What's going on?

999
00:47:52.209 --> 00:47:54.088
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

1000
00:47:54.808 --> 00:47:56.526
What is he doing in there?

1001
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:00.565
Ugh.

1002
00:48:00.645 --> 00:48:02.765
- Come on!
- In a minute. I'm still hungry.

1003
00:48:02.804 --> 00:48:03.883
No, KUZCO!

1004
00:48:03.923 --> 00:48:05.364
Okay, I'll make it simple for you.

1005
00:48:05.443 --> 00:48:07.283
I'll have a spinach omelette
with wheat toast.

1006
00:48:07.362 --> 00:48:09.041
- You got it?
- Can do.

1007
00:48:09.121 --> 00:48:11.440
What's taking so long?

1008
00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.680
- Pickup!
- Kronk! What are you doing?

1009
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.958
- Kinda busy here.
- Why am I not surprised?

1010
00:48:16.039 --> 00:48:17.197
Your order's up!

1011
00:48:17.278 --> 00:48:18.438
Ohh!

1012
00:48:18.798 --> 00:48:20.356
Oh, well, while you're at it,

1013
00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:22.716
make me the special.
And hold the gravy!

1014
00:48:22.756 --> 00:48:23.996
Check. Pickup!

1015
00:48:24.075 --> 00:48:26.394
You know what? On second thought,
make my omelette a meat pie.

1016
00:48:26.435 --> 00:48:27.514
Meat pie. Check.

1017
00:48:27.554 --> 00:48:28.553
Kronk!

1018
00:48:29.633 --> 00:48:31.553
Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?

1019
00:48:31.592 --> 00:48:33.391
- I'll have to charge you full price.
- Ooh!

1020
00:48:33.591 --> 00:48:35.311
Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

1021
00:48:35.391 --> 00:48:37.030
You got it.
Want cheese on those potatoes?

1022
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.670
Thank you, Kronk. Cheddar will be fine.

1023
00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:40.429
- Cheddar spuds coming up.
- Spuds yes, cheese no.

1024
00:48:40.508 --> 00:48:42.427
- Hold the cheese.
- No, I want the cheese.

1025
00:48:42.468 --> 00:48:43.547
Cheese me no like.

1026
00:48:43.628 --> 00:48:44.667
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!

1027
00:48:44.746 --> 00:48:45.786
Come on, make up your mind!

1028
00:48:45.866 --> 00:48:46.986
Okay, okay, on second thought...

1029
00:48:47.066 --> 00:48:48.505
Make my potatoes a salad.

1030
00:49:04.139 --> 00:49:05.977
Excuse me.
You see that woman over there?

1031
00:49:07.937 --> 00:49:10.176
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

1032
00:49:15.134 --> 00:49:16.413
One, two, three, four...

1033
00:49:16.494 --> 00:49:18.652
<i>Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you</i>

1034
00:49:18.732 --> 00:49:21.211
<i>We wish it was our birthday
So we could party, too</i>

1035
00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:23.570
<i>Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true</i>

1036
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:24.970
Ho-ho-ho.

1037
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:26.688
It's your birthday?

1038
00:49:28.488 --> 00:49:30.167
What are you doing?

1039
00:49:30.247 --> 00:49:31.886
Look, there's two people
in there looking for you.

1040
00:49:31.967 --> 00:49:33.806
- What?
- A big guy and a skinny old woman.

1041
00:49:33.886 --> 00:49:35.965
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

1042
00:49:36.004 --> 00:49:38.883
- Oh, yeah.
- That's YZMA and Kronk! I'm saved!

1043
00:49:38.964 --> 00:49:40.644
Trust me, they're not here to save you.

1044
00:49:40.723 --> 00:49:42.163
They'll take me back to the palace.

1045
00:49:42.243 --> 00:49:43.841
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

1046
00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:44.882
I can take it from here.

1047
00:49:44.962 --> 00:49:47.520
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

1048
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.159
Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.

1049
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.238
- No. I can't let you!
- What? Wha...

1050
00:49:52.317 --> 00:49:54.198
Oh, oh, I get it!

1051
00:49:54.797 --> 00:49:56.476
You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

1052
00:49:56.556 --> 00:49:58.795
You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.

1053
00:49:58.876 --> 00:49:59.994
No!

1054
00:50:00.035 --> 00:50:01.435
This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.

1055
00:50:01.514 --> 00:50:02.794
Will you just listen to me...

1056
00:50:02.873 --> 00:50:06.113
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is your stupid hilltop!

1057
00:50:06.192 --> 00:50:07.192
What?

1058
00:50:07.272 --> 00:50:09.351
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.

1059
00:50:09.432 --> 00:50:10.391
- Go!
- But...

1060
00:50:10.471 --> 00:50:12.469
Go on! Get outta here!

1061
00:50:12.749 --> 00:50:14.549
Fine! Hmph!

1062
00:50:15.068 --> 00:50:18.387
- Oh, this entire mess is all your fault.
- What'd I do?

1063
00:50:18.428 --> 00:50:22.146
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
KUZCO would be dead now!

1064
00:50:22.226 --> 00:50:26.744
There'll be no more diversions until
we track that llama down and kill him!

1065
00:50:26.824 --> 00:50:28.863
Said I was sorry. Can't just let it go.

1066
00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:30.782
Not even on your birthday.

1067
00:50:30.862 --> 00:50:32.941
KUZCO must be eliminated.

1068
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:36.020
The empire will finally be
rid of that useless slug.

1069
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.499
You got a point.

1070
00:50:37.579 --> 00:50:39.778
Nobody really seems to care
that he's gone, do they?

1071
00:50:43.097 --> 00:50:44.776
Pacha!

1072
00:50:48.615 --> 00:50:50.134
Pacha?

1073
00:51:26.319 --> 00:51:28.198
<i>So this is where you came in.</i>

1074
00:51:28.278 --> 00:51:31.076
<i>See, just like I said, I'm the victim here.</i>

1075
00:51:31.156 --> 00:51:33.036
<i>I didn't do anything,
and they ruined my life</i>

1076
00:51:33.076 --> 00:51:34.116
<i>and took everything I had.</i>

1077
00:51:34.195 --> 00:51:35.674
Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?

1078
00:51:35.755 --> 00:51:37.994
<i>What? I'm just telling them
what happened.</i>

1079
00:51:38.034 --> 00:51:39.393
Who you kidding, pal?

1080
00:51:39.473 --> 00:51:41.712
They saw the whole thing,
they know what happened.

1081
00:51:41.752 --> 00:51:43.472
<i>Well, yeah, but...</i>

1082
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:45.151
Just leave me alone.

1083
00:52:11.619 --> 00:52:14.259
The peasant at the diner!

1084
00:52:16.257 --> 00:52:17.777
He didn't pay his cheque.

1085
00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:30.892
He's the peasant
who I saw leaving the city

1086
00:52:30.972 --> 00:52:34.171
who disappeared into the crowd
with KUZCO on the back of his cart.

1087
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.609
He must have taken him
back to his village,

1088
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.528
so if we find the village, we find him,
and if we find him, we find KUZCO.

1089
00:52:39.888 --> 00:52:42.487
Oh, yeah, it's all comin' together.

1090
00:52:43.806 --> 00:52:45.525
- YZMA!
- What?

1091
00:52:45.605 --> 00:52:46.765
Aah!

1092
00:52:46.885 --> 00:52:48.804
This had better be good!

1093
00:53:49.379 --> 00:53:50.338
Yuck!

1094
00:53:52.378 --> 00:53:53.977
So,
there we were standing on the cliff,

1095
00:53:54.017 --> 00:53:56.096
and the ground started to rumble.

1096
00:53:56.177 --> 00:54:00.054
And just as it started to go,
he grabbed me before I fell.

1097
00:54:00.094 --> 00:54:02.054
Do you believe that?

1098
00:54:02.133 --> 00:54:05.012
You know, call me crazy for following
this guy all the way out here,

1099
00:54:05.053 --> 00:54:08.811
but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him.

1100
00:54:08.851 --> 00:54:11.929
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

1101
00:54:12.009 --> 00:54:14.008
He's a lousy llama.

1102
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:17.487
I mean, a really lousy llama.

1103
00:54:29.323 --> 00:54:31.401
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know,

1104
00:54:31.481 --> 00:54:35.360
what I said to you back at the diner,
that, I didn't really...

1105
00:54:36.798 --> 00:54:39.558
So, you tired of being a llama?

1106
00:54:39.718 --> 00:54:42.917
Yes!

1107
00:54:44.195 --> 00:54:46.755
Okay, we're just gonna stop
at the house and get some supplies.

1108
00:54:46.835 --> 00:54:48.713
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

1109
00:54:48.794 --> 00:54:51.353
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

1110
00:54:51.393 --> 00:54:52.512
My relatives?

1111
00:54:52.552 --> 00:54:54.392
We just sent them up to your house.

1112
00:54:54.432 --> 00:54:55.471
What did they look like?

1113
00:54:55.551 --> 00:54:59.109
See, there was this big guy
and this older woman who was...

1114
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.869
How would you describe her?

1115
00:55:00.948 --> 00:55:02.308
Scary beyond all reason.

1116
00:55:02.389 --> 00:55:03.708
Yeah, that's it.

1117
00:55:04.187 --> 00:55:06.907
So, remind me again
how you're related to Pacha?

1118
00:55:08.226 --> 00:55:10.985
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's
wife's step-niece's great-aunt.

1119
00:55:12.184 --> 00:55:14.103
Twice removed.

1120
00:55:15.263 --> 00:55:16.262
Uh-huh.

1121
00:55:16.343 --> 00:55:18.022
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1122
00:55:18.101 --> 00:55:20.581
<i>Ninety-nine monkeys
jumpin' on the bed</i>

1123
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.379
<i>One fell off and bumped his head</i>

1124
00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.458
You know, I am so sorry
that you had to come all this way,

1125
00:55:26.537 --> 00:55:28.897
but as I said to you before,

1126
00:55:28.977 --> 00:55:31.376
you may recall, Pacha is not here.

1127
00:55:31.457 --> 00:55:33.135
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.

1128
00:55:33.215 --> 00:55:37.014
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

1129
00:55:37.093 --> 00:55:38.492
Oops!

1130
00:55:38.573 --> 00:55:39.573
Silly me.

1131
00:55:39.653 --> 00:55:41.812
No, no. Allow me.

1132
00:55:46.289 --> 00:55:47.369
She's hiding something.

1133
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:49.209
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1134
00:55:49.288 --> 00:55:51.287
Okay, but I still have 94 monkeys to go.

1135
00:55:51.568 --> 00:55:52.727
Grr!

1136
00:55:53.447 --> 00:55:55.485
So, while we're waiting for Paca...

1137
00:55:55.525 --> 00:55:58.604
- Pacha.
- Oh, yes. Um...

1138
00:55:58.684 --> 00:56:01.044
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1139
00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:04.323
You know, why don't you just come
back when Pacha gets home?

1140
00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:07.361
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...

1141
00:56:07.641 --> 00:56:09.600
Excuse me, won't you?

1142
00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.439
I think I left something in the oven.

1143
00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:15.876
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.

1144
00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:17.597
- Kronk, it's time!
- Okay!

1145
00:56:18.556 --> 00:56:19.516
Grr!

1146
00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:23.034
So, we have to get back to the palace,
find the lab, and change him back.

1147
00:56:23.074 --> 00:56:24.473
- Hi there!
- Aah!

1148
00:56:24.554 --> 00:56:26.953
- Um, that was him.
- Whoops.

1149
00:56:28.912 --> 00:56:29.952
You know what?

1150
00:56:30.031 --> 00:56:32.350
I don't believe
you're really my great-aunt.

1151
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.590
You're more like my great-great-great...

1152
00:56:34.669 --> 00:56:37.268
Go. I'll stall them long enough
for you two to get a head start.

1153
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:38.628
Thanks, honey.

1154
00:56:38.708 --> 00:56:41.467
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.

1155
00:56:41.987 --> 00:56:44.425
- Great-great-great...
- Grr.

1156
00:56:44.465 --> 00:56:47.144
All right! Are you through?

1157
00:56:47.184 --> 00:56:49.063
- Great-great-aunt.
- So, where were we?

1158
00:56:49.103 --> 00:56:50.583
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until...

1159
00:56:50.663 --> 00:56:52.542
I show you the house. Of course.

1160
00:56:53.261 --> 00:56:55.780
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1161
00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.100
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1162
00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.059
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.

1163
00:57:02.098 --> 00:57:03.777
There is no handle in here.

1164
00:57:03.817 --> 00:57:06.017
There's not? Are you sure?

1165
00:57:06.056 --> 00:57:07.895
All right, I've had enough of this.

1166
00:57:08.255 --> 00:57:11.214
Tell us where the talking llama is and
we'll burn your house to the ground.

1167
00:57:11.334 --> 00:57:13.813
Uh, don't you mean "or"?

1168
00:57:13.892 --> 00:57:17.412
Tell us where the talking llama is
or we'll burn your house to the ground.

1169
00:57:17.491 --> 00:57:18.492
Well, which is it?

1170
00:57:18.531 --> 00:57:20.291
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1171
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:23.489
That's it! Kronk, break the door down!

1172
00:57:23.529 --> 00:57:26.449
Break it down? Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.

1173
00:57:26.528 --> 00:57:28.567
I don't care, you fool. Get out of my way.

1174
00:57:28.607 --> 00:57:30.527
I'll break it down myself.

1175
00:57:30.606 --> 00:57:33.125
- A-one...
- Okay, kids, you know what to do.

1176
00:57:33.204 --> 00:57:35.045
- Two...
- Right, Mom!

1177
00:57:35.124 --> 00:57:36.604
Three!

1178
00:57:37.203 --> 00:57:38.402
Aah!

1179
00:57:47.519 --> 00:57:52.317
Okay, children, on your mark,
get set, go!

1180
00:57:52.637 --> 00:57:55.716
Ow, ow!
Stop it, you little brats!

1181
00:57:55.796 --> 00:57:57.035
Huh?

1182
00:57:57.275 --> 00:57:58.354
Ow!

1183
00:57:58.634 --> 00:58:02.193
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1184
00:58:04.112 --> 00:58:05.551
Well, I had a great time.

1185
00:58:05.631 --> 00:58:08.750
Let's not wait until the next
family reunion to get together.

1186
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:09.870
Kronk!

1187
00:58:09.949 --> 00:58:11.989
I gotta run.

1188
00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:20.080
Okay, why does she even
have that lever?

1189
00:59:22.639 --> 00:59:23.759
<i>Please remain seated</i>

1190
00:59:23.799 --> 00:59:25.677
<i>and keep your arms
and legs in at all times.</i>

1191
00:59:26.518 --> 00:59:27.518
Aah!

1192
00:59:29.836 --> 00:59:30.796
Huh?

1193
00:59:33.354 --> 00:59:36.233
- What does it look like?
- I don't know. Just keep looking.

1194
00:59:36.274 --> 00:59:37.432
Over here!

1195
00:59:37.513 --> 00:59:41.271
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1196
00:59:41.351 --> 00:59:43.391
Oh, my.

1197
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.190
Looking for this?

1198
00:59:47.149 --> 00:59:49.028
No! It can't be!

1199
00:59:49.108 --> 00:59:50.948
- How did you get back here before us?
- Uh...

1200
00:59:52.826 --> 00:59:54.066
How did we, Kronk?

1201
00:59:54.145 --> 00:59:57.225
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.

1202
00:59:57.784 --> 00:59:59.424
Oh, well, back to business.

1203
00:59:59.504 --> 01:00:01.183
Okay, I admit it.

1204
01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:02.822
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1205
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:05.621
but, YZMA,
do you really want to kill me?

1206
01:00:05.661 --> 01:00:08.780
Just think of it as you're being let go,

1207
01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.018
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1208
01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:14.617
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1209
01:00:14.657 --> 01:00:17.736
Hey, that's kind of like what he said
to you when you got fired.

1210
01:00:17.816 --> 01:00:22.493
I know. It's called a cruel irony
like my dependence on you.

1211
01:00:22.574 --> 01:00:24.134
I can't believe this is happening!

1212
01:00:24.214 --> 01:00:26.212
Then I bet you weren't expecting this.

1213
01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:27.611
- No!
- Aah!

1214
01:00:28.172 --> 01:00:29.131
Ah-ha!

1215
01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:30.610
Oh, okay.

1216
01:00:30.851 --> 01:00:32.410
Finish them off.

1217
01:00:34.728 --> 01:00:37.648
<i>Hey, you're not
backing down now, are you, big guy?</i>

1218
01:00:38.887 --> 01:00:40.327
Uh, where's the other guy?

1219
01:00:41.926 --> 01:00:43.285
Yo!

1220
01:00:43.365 --> 01:00:45.165
Sorry I'm late. So, what'd I miss?

1221
01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:46.844
Well, YZMA just tossed me this knife

1222
01:00:46.923 --> 01:00:49.084
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1223
01:00:49.163 --> 01:00:51.761
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1224
01:00:51.841 --> 01:00:53.002
and quite honestly...

1225
01:00:53.042 --> 01:00:55.880
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1226
01:00:55.959 --> 01:00:57.359
This one simple thing.

1227
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.799
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.

1228
01:00:58.879 --> 01:00:59.917
Whoa! Now.

1229
01:00:59.998 --> 01:01:02.757
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1230
01:01:02.837 --> 01:01:03.796
Ouch.

1231
01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:04.995
And do you want to know
something else?

1232
01:01:05.077 --> 01:01:06.995
I've never liked your spinach puffs.

1233
01:01:07.075 --> 01:01:09.355
Never!

1234
01:01:11.353 --> 01:01:13.152
That's it. She's going down.

1235
01:01:13.192 --> 01:01:14.632
Now, now, remember, guys.

1236
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:17.791
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

1237
01:01:20.869 --> 01:01:22.110
That'll work.

1238
01:01:29.066 --> 01:01:30.785
Strange. That usually works.

1239
01:01:30.866 --> 01:01:32.184
And so does this!

1240
01:01:32.304 --> 01:01:33.864
Ah, should have seen that coming.

1241
01:01:33.944 --> 01:01:35.384
Whoa!

1242
01:01:36.463 --> 01:01:37.542
Aah!

1243
01:01:37.622 --> 01:01:39.382
Give me that vial!

1244
01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:42.821
- Oof!
- Ah! Ha ha!

1245
01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:49.937
Oops! Clumsy me.

1246
01:01:51.297 --> 01:01:53.295
Which one? Which one?

1247
01:01:55.735 --> 01:01:58.613
Better hurry. I'm expecting company.

1248
01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:04.411
Kill them! They murdered the emperor!

1249
01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:08.209
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me... KUZCO!

1250
01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:09.529
They're not listening to me!

1251
01:02:09.609 --> 01:02:11.449
Just take 'em all!

1252
01:02:19.005 --> 01:02:20.005
Get them!

1253
01:02:20.045 --> 01:02:23.043
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?

1254
01:02:23.123 --> 01:02:25.482
You're excused. Anyone else?

1255
01:02:25.562 --> 01:02:26.922
No, we're good.

1256
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:28.282
Get them!

1257
01:02:28.322 --> 01:02:30.880
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

1258
01:02:33.319 --> 01:02:35.038
Uh, Pacha? A little help!

1259
01:02:37.957 --> 01:02:38.916
Come on! Come on!

1260
01:02:40.676 --> 01:02:41.756
Aah!

1261
01:02:46.234 --> 01:02:48.353
Oh, please be something with wings.

1262
01:02:50.792 --> 01:02:53.471
Yeah! We're fl yin'!

1263
01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:55.030
Uh-oh.

1264
01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.867
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.

1265
01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:03.666
- I'm picking the next one!
- Fine by me!

1266
01:03:03.706 --> 01:03:04.787
Give me that one!

1267
01:03:06.705 --> 01:03:08.384
Don't you say a word.

1268
01:03:13.502 --> 01:03:15.022
Quick! Drain the canals!

1269
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.700
Open up!

1270
01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:23.218
Yay! I'm a llama again!

1271
01:03:23.298 --> 01:03:24.417
Wait...

1272
01:03:33.053 --> 01:03:34.654
There they go! After them!

1273
01:03:34.693 --> 01:03:38.012
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

1274
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:44.130
Grr!

1275
01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.844
Okay, only two left.
It's gotta be one of these.

1276
01:04:00.123 --> 01:04:01.162
- Aah!
- Ah!

1277
01:04:02.682 --> 01:04:03.801
No!

1278
01:04:14.036 --> 01:04:15.797
I'll take that.

1279
01:04:15.876 --> 01:04:18.235
This is the one.
This'll change you back to a human.

1280
01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:21.274
Ow! Hey, get her off!

1281
01:04:22.672 --> 01:04:24.273
- Get her off me!
- Ohh!

1282
01:04:26.991 --> 01:04:28.591
Aah! Ow!

1283
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:33.869
Drink the potion!

1284
01:04:33.948 --> 01:04:35.468
Okay, okay.

1285
01:04:35.508 --> 01:04:37.027
Where did it go? Where is it?

1286
01:04:37.067 --> 01:04:39.466
Looking for this?

1287
01:04:39.787 --> 01:04:42.824
Is that my voice?
Is that my voice?

1288
01:04:43.664 --> 01:04:44.744
Oh, well.

1289
01:04:44.784 --> 01:04:46.104
No! Don't drop it!

1290
01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.462
I'm not going to drop it, you fool!

1291
01:04:48.543 --> 01:04:50.421
I'm going to drink it!

1292
01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:53.181
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self,

1293
01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:55.739
I'm going to kill you!

1294
01:05:04.095 --> 01:05:05.055
Aah!

1295
01:05:05.136 --> 01:05:06.375
Aah! Uh-oh!

1296
01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:22.528
Whoa!

1297
01:05:24.926 --> 01:05:25.887
Ohh!

1298
01:05:27.166 --> 01:05:28.725
KUZCO!

1299
01:05:28.805 --> 01:05:30.205
Be right there! Give me a minute!

1300
01:05:32.564 --> 01:05:34.003
KUZCO! Whoa!

1301
01:05:35.882 --> 01:05:37.722
KUZCO!

1302
01:05:44.119 --> 01:05:45.478
The vial!

1303
01:05:53.515 --> 01:05:56.873
For the last time,
we did not order a giant trampoline.

1304
01:05:56.954 --> 01:06:00.272
You know, pal, you could have told me
that before I set it up.

1305
01:06:01.192 --> 01:06:02.592
Aah!

1306
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.230
Huh?

1307
01:06:15.106 --> 01:06:16.386
The vial!

1308
01:06:16.865 --> 01:06:18.464
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

1309
01:06:36.737 --> 01:06:38.136
- I win.
- Whoa!

1310
01:06:40.536 --> 01:06:42.294
Got it!

1311
01:06:42.374 --> 01:06:45.173
What are the odds of that
trapdoor leading me out here?

1312
01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:54.929
Here, let me get this for you.

1313
01:06:57.249 --> 01:07:00.207
Well, see ya on the other side.

1314
01:07:09.403 --> 01:07:13.162
Now, you stop being so hard
on yourself. All is forgiven.

1315
01:07:13.242 --> 01:07:14.201
You're sure?

1316
01:07:14.282 --> 01:07:16.881
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,

1317
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.520
and it won't be the last.

1318
01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:20.398
What can I say? I'm a rebel.

1319
01:07:20.479 --> 01:07:21.718
Whoa-ho-ho! Tiger.

1320
01:07:21.798 --> 01:07:23.877
Oh! Hey, I got to use that arm later.

1321
01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.637
Okay, buddy, take care.

1322
01:07:26.915 --> 01:07:28.355
He's a sweet guy.

1323
01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:39.830
So, you lied to me.

1324
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.389
- I did?
- Yeah.

1325
01:07:43.429 --> 01:07:46.827
You said when the sun hits this ridge
just right, these hills sing.

1326
01:07:46.908 --> 01:07:48.986
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills,

1327
01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:51.066
and I did not hear any singing.

1328
01:07:54.425 --> 01:07:55.423
So...

1329
01:07:55.504 --> 01:08:00.142
I'll be building my summer home
on a more magical hill. Thank you.

1330
01:08:02.542 --> 01:08:05.339
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool
over your eyes, huh?

1331
01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.339
No, no, I'm sharp, I'm on it.

1332
01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:08.498
Looks like you and your family

1333
01:08:08.538 --> 01:08:10.738
are stuck on that tuneless
hilltop forever, pal.

1334
01:08:19.214 --> 01:08:23.213
You know, I'm pretty sure I heard
some singing on the hill next to us.

1335
01:08:24.172 --> 01:08:25.611
In case you're interested.

1336
01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:30.408
Ha!

1337
01:08:30.449 --> 01:08:31.849
Boom, baby!

1338
01:08:31.888 --> 01:08:33.528
Ha! Boom, baby!

1339
01:08:37.286 --> 01:08:40.045
<i>You'd be the coolest dude in the nation</i>

1340
01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:42.084
<i>Or the hippest cat in creation</i>

1341
01:08:42.164 --> 01:08:45.403
<i>But if you ain't got friends
then nothing's worth the fuss</i>

1342
01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:48.842
<i>A perfect world will come to be</i>

1343
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:50.880
<i>When everybody here can see</i>

1344
01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.120
<i>That a perfect world begins and ends</i>

1345
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.359
<i>A perfect world begins and ends</i>

1346
01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:58.077
<i>A perfect world begins
and ends with us</i>

1347
01:08:59.558 --> 01:09:01.156
"My acorn is missing."

1348
01:09:01.236 --> 01:09:03.035
Squeak squeakin'
squeak Squeakity.

1349
01:09:03.115 --> 01:09:04.635
"Did you eat the acorn?"

1350
01:09:04.755 --> 01:09:06.674
Squeaker
squeak squeak squeakin'?

1351
01:09:06.713 --> 01:09:08.474
"You owe me a new acorn."

1352
01:09:08.754 --> 01:09:10.712
Squeak squeak squeak squeak
squeaker...

1353
01:09:12.832 --> 01:09:13.791
squeakin'.

1354
01:09:13.911 --> 01:09:15.230
I'm so proud of you guys.
