1
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.708
You've got the face of a
man who wishes for death.

2
00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:25.946
I just want peace.

3
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:31.752
You know too well, a life of
peace can be so very boring.

4
00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:35.755
You live for battle.

5
00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:38.525
There's a raging demon
inside you, I've seen it.

6
00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:40.927
That was a long time ago.

7
00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:44.264
But, at the same time, there's
also a coward inside you.

8
00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:45.499
I've seen that as well.

9
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.002
Are you in pain?

10
00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.741
Only from the sound
of your bloody voice.

11
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:56.876
End this,

12
00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.613
I do not fear death.

13
00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:02.148
Not your own.

14
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.022
But when a man has a family,
he's never truly free.

15
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.193
This is between you and I.

16
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:19.967
Imagine, you and your boy
lying bound, bleeding, watching,

17
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.635
while I have my fun
with your dear wife?

18
00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.604
You dare threaten them.

19
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:28.741
A bit of spirit from
noble, diplomatic Ander.

20
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:32.580
You come to me,
looking for a truce.

21
00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:38.252
Compromise does not exist here.

22
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.390
I believe there is good
in everything, even you.

23
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:46.159
So, kind of how there's evil,

24
00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:48.829
even in holy-than-thou Ander.

25
00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.165
That's for the gods to decide.

26
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:58.238
There is no evil,
no good, only nature,

27
00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:02.609
the animal spirits and
the animals, like us.

28
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.244
Must you bloody talk so much?

29
00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.113
There,

30
00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:08.582
that's what I'm looking for.

31
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.252
Please, Amleth, we
could still have peace.

32
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.123
I don't want your bloody peace.

33
00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.370
Agree to the games, Ander,

34
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:05.372
and we can just leave this
blood lust for the circle.

35
00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:07.306
It's simple.
No.

36
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.875
The games, Ander.

37
00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.646
There's nothing sporting
about your games, Amleth.

38
00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:14.482
Last warning,

39
00:05:14.483 --> 00:05:16.616
I don't want to use this.

40
00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.752
No, you want a better
tomorrow, don't you?

41
00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:21.320
A better today.

42
00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:28.195
If you want your peace,
then let the games commence.

43
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:33.401
There'll be no one
left to enjoy the peace.

44
00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:35.668
Last chance,

45
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.670
let my family be.

46
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.340
No, this is your last chance.

47
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.210
Use that on me now

48
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.946
or I'll take it off you
and gut you with it.

49
00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:51.017
And then, who to violate first,

50
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:54.354
your pretty daughter
or your pretty son?

51
00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:56.624
I warned you.

52
00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:00.860
Do what you feel you must.

53
00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:01.621
Come Bodil, it's already battle.

54
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:11.664
Are you sure this one
squirted from Father's loins?

55
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:16.870
Something you never
told us, Mother?

56
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.238
Your brother's right.

57
00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.642
How would you expect
to win a real battle?

58
00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.579
Is this how my youngest dies?

59
00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.649
Is it?

60
00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.623
Improvisation, wonderful.

61
00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.803
We are both our
father's sons, Finnr.

62
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:54.141
If that's so, why do I
thrash you around so easily?

63
00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.710
Didn't I just win?

64
00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.879
No.

65
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.681
Mother.

66
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.681
Silence, both of you.

67
00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:09.188
Are our competitors
preparing for the games?

68
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.925
I can't wait to
meet Ander's family.

69
00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.262
I have grave news, My Lady.

70
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.030
What news?

71
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.201
Speak.

72
00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:24.137
Where's my husband?

73
00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:26.172
There was a.

74
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.276
Forgive me.

75
00:08:30.277 --> 00:08:32.912
Why aren't I hearing
this through Amleth's lips?

76
00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:34.847
That's not possible.

77
00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:38.450
Get to the point.

78
00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:42.489
And once more,

79
00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:46.293
where is my husband?

80
00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:02.374
Are you not worried, Uncle?

81
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.710
I worry for the bloody idiot

82
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:06.012
that pushes your father too far.

83
00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:09.148
About as clever as sticking
your head under a horse's tail.

84
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:10.818
Is that you complimenting him?

85
00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.025
Uncle.

86
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:21.493
Father refused to
tell me of the games

87
00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.163
these Berserkers participate in.

88
00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:27.601
You flatter them, calling
them Berserkers, Gro.

89
00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:31.871
Perhaps once they were, but now,

90
00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:33.674
these people are something else.

91
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:39.912
This Amleth creature, he
wants to force this family

92
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.248
into his games, including
your mother and sister.

93
00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.251
And what do the games involve?

94
00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.186
Human cock fighting.

95
00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:51.523
And, I don't mean humans
fighting with their cocks.

96
00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.558
That is why Father

97
00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:55.127
was so very.
Yes,

98
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.930
he was so very.

99
00:09:58.065 --> 00:09:59.900
Have you ever seen
the games in action?

100
00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:07.607
Your father and
I and this savage,

101
00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:13.714
our troops fought together,
side-by-side, during the wars.

102
00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.448
And then why does he hate us so?

103
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.784
It's your father he hates,

104
00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.652
us by extension, we're a bonus.

105
00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:21.220
But why?

106
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.488
That's a question
for your father.

107
00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:23.923
But Uncle, there must be.

108
00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:24.958
Enough, boy.

109
00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:29.863
Or I'll hit you with this,
right into the trees.

110
00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.165
Point taken.

111
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.836
Or rather, blunt edge taken.

112
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.375
That thing is a beauty.

113
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:45.344
How dare you.

114
00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:48.348
Gudrind is a she, not a thing.

115
00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.249
A she?

116
00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:55.422
Finely crafted objects
like this have a soul.

117
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.192
I didn't choose her, she
found me during the war.

118
00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:01.194
Are they all female?

119
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.699
How does your object
feel within your hand?

120
00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:09.903
Good.

121
00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:10.938
Then it's female.

122
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:15.575
Her name will be Assy.

123
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.676
Assy?

124
00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:19.779
Why?

125
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.048
Because she feels like
a goddess in my hands.

126
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:25.451
You want me to leave
you alone with her?

127
00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:27.553
Ah, as always, you
are disgusting, Uncle.

128
00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:28.554
That's me.

129
00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:35.995
If we believe that a
gentle soul resides

130
00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:39.166
within these weapons, then
we don't use them lightly.

131
00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:42.368
Not for vengeance,

132
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.536
certainly not for sport.

133
00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:45.938
We use them for defense.

134
00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:48.041
Speaking of which.

135
00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:50.310
Show yourself.

136
00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:54.781
We mean you no harm,
unless you mean us harm,

137
00:11:54.782 --> 00:11:56.917
in which case, piss off.

138
00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:09.662
Went well, did it?

139
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440
Mother.

140
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.516
He was not meant to
die by a soft-hand.

141
00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:32.651
All he wanted was his games.

142
00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.921
Ander is a fierce warrior.

143
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.122
No.

144
00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:37.857
And father died a
worthy death in battle.

145
00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:38.858
It's.
No.

146
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.594
- It was the death he.
- No.

147
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.632
Your father's watching now,

148
00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.868
through the eyes of
the wolves, the bears,

149
00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.137
the birds from above.

150
00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.674
He expects his games.

151
00:12:56.376 --> 00:13:00.180
Get Finnr, he's the
man of the clan now.

152
00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:02.415
Go.

153
00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.415
Aye, Mother.

154
00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:13.393
Talked with Amleth.

155
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.697
Seems he's not
one for reasoning.

156
00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:19.900
What a total shock.

157
00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:23.669
Spare your sarcasm, Brother.

158
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.737
I can't, it's a part of me.

159
00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.639
The games, Father.

160
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.577
If Amleth is dead, then surely
it is no longer a problem.

161
00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:32.712
What did you tell him?

162
00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:34.513
Me?

163
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.685
Oh, thank Oden, your back.

164
00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:40.552
Ah.

165
00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:44.857
He's injured and all you
can think is to give him wine?

166
00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:46.458
Seemed most urgent.

167
00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.060
Father,

168
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.628
you were gone so
long, I was worried.

169
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:52.464
You all right, Father?

170
00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:54.101
Oh, you should
see the other guy.

171
00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:56.035
What happened?

172
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.906
We need to leave.

173
00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:02.174
Leave?

174
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.642
You killed him, didn't you?

175
00:14:03.643 --> 00:14:05.912
So much for your life of peace.

176
00:14:05.913 --> 00:14:07.346
I had to.

177
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:11.283
Or, I can't even say out loud

178
00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:12.986
what he would've
done to you all.

179
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:15.854
I don't understand.

180
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.925
Father, who is this
man that you speak of?

181
00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.059
Amleth.

182
00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:23.629
He was a man I knew in the wars,

183
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.667
an animal worshiper,
now leader of a tribe.

184
00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:30.237
A cult, really.

185
00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:35.841
Who want nothing more
than blood by the gallon.

186
00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:40.247
I thought I heard the last
of him but I was wrong.

187
00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:44.084
Now, he found me.

188
00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:46.186
He found us.

189
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:49.056
But, now he's dead.

190
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.960
And those swines no
longer have a leader.

191
00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:58.764
Cut off the snake's
head, another grows back.

192
00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.599
You cut off his head?

193
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.434
Shut up, Gunnar.

194
00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.736
Amleth had sons,

195
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.241
two by blood, many
more by blood oath.

196
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.345
I was naive this morning.

197
00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:17.349
Now I know this
feud will never end.

198
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.918
What are you saying, Father?

199
00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:21.387
We need to travel West.

200
00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:22.455
- No.
- Brother.

201
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.658
We cannot let these animals
drive us from our home.

202
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:27.859
To hell with them.

203
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.996
Let's fight back.

204
00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:34.000
That would be a sheep
eating from a fox's hand.

205
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.402
Yeah, he means dangerous.

206
00:15:37.137 --> 00:15:41.608
But Father, with you and
Uncle, surely we can take them.

207
00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:44.443
And besides, loveless
souls like that,

208
00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:47.013
perhaps they won't
even come for us.

209
00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.848
There's at least
a dozen of them.

210
00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:51.784
We can't risk it.

211
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:59.392
And I can't live knowing
you're all in danger.

212
00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:02.461
Father's right.

213
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.763
We can't just wait here hoping
nothing will ever happen,

214
00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:06.999
being forever on edge.

215
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.636
I've never met these
heathens and I never wish to.

216
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.639
A woman should
never have to fight.

217
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.342
We should always be prepared to.

218
00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:23.516
We were married here, our
children were born here.

219
00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:26.019
Do you want them to die here?

220
00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:30.056
And the gods speak of
people who are immortal.

221
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:31.724
And what if we're those people?

222
00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:34.560
I'm sure the gods
would also call

223
00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:37.564
anyone waiting around to
find out, a bloody fool.

224
00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:42.201
They could be
here at any moment.

225
00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:43.702
We need to leave.

226
00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:44.703
We can't.

227
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.306
Oh, silly brother.

228
00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:48.375
I can't.

229
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.246
Freda's body may rest here,

230
00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:58.085
but her soul, she goes
wherever you travel.

231
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.490
Come,

232
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.160
we must prepare to leave.

233
00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:15.868
A great man has fallen.

234
00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:21.740
No, has been taken.

235
00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:28.348
His only crime, the
pursuit of good sport.

236
00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:32.252
It was my father's only dream.

237
00:17:35.688 --> 00:17:38.625
For the great bearer to
call down a rain of blood

238
00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:43.930
from the wounds gouged
by the Joseph families,

239
00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:46.099
in the great savage war.

240
00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:49.936
A blood storm,

241
00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:54.206
paling anything
that false god Thor

242
00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:56.442
could only hope to conjure.

243
00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:57.910
In remembrance of my father,

244
00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:02.182
I call this storm to fall
on the pious hypocrite,

245
00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:06.452
the coward, known as Ander.

246
00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:09.922
Your father was a god.

247
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.292
A wolf in man's form.

248
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:19.631
Bring the storm.

249
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.834
Yes, thank you my sons.

250
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:26.372
May the heathen Ander

251
00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:29.108
be soaked in the blood
of his own family.

252
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.677
And with that,

253
00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:33.446
the gift of
immortality for us all.

254
00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:39.218
To the fallen, placed
forever by my father's side.

255
00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:43.890
I look to you as if
you were Amleth himself.

256
00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.464
When he found the bastard,

257
00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:54.567
the liar Ander,

258
00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:58.637
this year's games
was an opportunity

259
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:03.243
for the great beast god to
see their creation in action,

260
00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:07.146
to see what we are
truly capable of.

261
00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:15.555
Anything less than the
bastard Ander, will deny us.

262
00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:19.492
There is nothing
short of blasphemous.

263
00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:23.263
We shall avenge him.

264
00:19:25.432 --> 00:19:28.300
And have much fun
in the process.

265
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.180
I know you can hear me.

266
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:45.385
I must protect them.

267
00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:51.123
I've never let your side,

268
00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:53.059
even in your death.

269
00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:56.329
But they've kept me together,

270
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:02.435
even when I was determined
to destroy myself.

271
00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:06.305
Remember that?

272
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.478
What I was like after
you were, taken.

273
00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:19.719
They're my family, your family.

274
00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:27.526
I don't ask for
your forgiveness,

275
00:20:27.527 --> 00:20:29.028
because I know you'd just say

276
00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.600
that there's nothing to forgive.

277
00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.571
Besides, this isn't you.

278
00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:46.978
You're here.

279
00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:05.732
Unless you're here
to cook supper,

280
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.569
I suggest you piss off on the
whore that carried you here.

281
00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:13.472
Hello, friend.

282
00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.977
Consider me a final
friendly warning.

283
00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:23.114
Get Ander, get the family,
and leave with me now.

284
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.115
It'll be fun.

285
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.185
I don't like fun.

286
00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:28.720
It's boring.

287
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:29.721
Trot on.

288
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:32.958
Know then, there
are others coming

289
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.893
who will not be so polite.

290
00:21:34.894 --> 00:21:38.296
My leader asked me to tell
you to keep this civilized,

291
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.297
if possible.

292
00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:43.869
From the looks of you,
I know who your leader is.

293
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.238
And the word is, he's as
dead as a hog on a spit.

294
00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:50.242
Amleth lives through
his son, Finnr the Brave.

295
00:21:51.578 --> 00:21:54.780
Oh, Finnr the
baby's all grown up.

296
00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:55.848
He's a man now.

297
00:21:56.716 --> 00:21:58.016
More than you'll be,

298
00:21:58.017 --> 00:22:00.386
once I squash your
tiny pecker into jelly.

299
00:22:00.387 --> 00:22:01.788
And he wants your family.

300
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:08.495
Leave now or I'll smash
your tiny bastard brains in.

301
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.088
I'll beat you in
the game, so we could.

302
00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:11.623
Just means you'll suffer longer.

303
00:23:11.624 --> 00:23:13.493
Suffer this, shit stain.

304
00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:40.719
We need to go, now.

305
00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:53.532
You have the will
and the strength

306
00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:55.502
of the great bear
on your side, Finnr.

307
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:00.606
I should be out there,

308
00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:02.674
on the hunt with our sons.

309
00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:04.175
No need.

310
00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:06.513
Soon your enemies will
be dragged before you.

311
00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:08.981
The animal spirits will it.

312
00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:18.356
I just wish I knew what
was going on out there.

313
00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:19.626
A messenger will come.

314
00:24:20.693 --> 00:24:22.728
Yeah, but not
fast enough, Mother.

315
00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:25.864
I want to know now and I
want to know everything.

316
00:24:25.865 --> 00:24:27.766
I just.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

317
00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:29.067
Patience.

318
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.609
We will bathe in
blood, together,

319
00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:39.879
once the games are over.

320
00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:05.672
Let's get some water.

321
00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:15.146
You know that one
was not a happy cherub.

322
00:25:15.147 --> 00:25:19.150
Anyone who'd think that these
animals have love for Amleth.

323
00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:20.620
Well, they are people too.

324
00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.488
Not in my book.

325
00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:29.628
Have you forgotten all the
horrors we saw men do in war,

326
00:25:29.629 --> 00:25:30.830
what we did?

327
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:32.798
We're not at war.

328
00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:34.332
But they are.

329
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:36.702
These barbarians are closer
to their natural human state

330
00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:38.469
than we care to admit.

331
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.972
Don't even think that, Ander.

332
00:25:40.973 --> 00:25:44.643
Well, the gods did make
us all, better or worse.

333
00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:45.877
Oh really?

334
00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:49.047
Well then I guess even
the gods get blind drunk

335
00:25:49.048 --> 00:25:50.849
and screw things up.

336
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.885
I thought Amleth could
be swayed, reasoned with.

337
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.655
But look at what my
mistake has cost us.

338
00:25:56.656 --> 00:25:58.056
As soon as I got word of him,

339
00:25:58.057 --> 00:26:00.192
I should have just
marched us outta there.

340
00:26:01.594 --> 00:26:04.996
No one accused you of having
the wisdom of Mamir, Brother.

341
00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:06.698
Shut up, Gunnar.

342
00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:08.901
You still think we're
impervious to death?

343
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.171
We head West and then what?

344
00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:17.776
A life by the
coast, even by sea.

345
00:26:17.777 --> 00:26:18.778
We have gold.

346
00:26:19.712 --> 00:26:21.446
Our options are endless.

347
00:26:21.447 --> 00:26:24.483
Perhaps, find a supple
maiden for this one.

348
00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:28.520
I'm still married,
Brother, still married.

349
00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:32.691
Your son is a cheeky bugger,

350
00:26:32.692 --> 00:26:34.193
but he does give me hope.

351
00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:44.903
What's this, a family party?

352
00:26:44.904 --> 00:26:46.838
Gro, go with them.

353
00:26:49.709 --> 00:26:50.976
I don't think we're invited.

354
00:26:50.977 --> 00:26:52.110
I don't care.

355
00:26:54.881 --> 00:26:56.347
We can take them.

356
00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:57.549
We can take them.

357
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.752
You have to keep them safe, boy.

358
00:27:00.753 --> 00:27:03.388
There's greatness in your
blood, you little shit.

359
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:07.059
Go, quickly.

360
00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:13.098
I was hoping to never
have to do this again.

361
00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:15.000
Likewise, little brother.

362
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:17.535
Cut us down and we'll
come back as wolves

363
00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:19.304
and eat your bones.

364
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:20.538
You know what?

365
00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:22.741
I'd really like to
see you do that.

366
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.862
It's bad luck to
die by a river, Ander.

367
00:28:16.863 --> 00:28:18.830
Come and join the games
and die with dignity.

368
00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:41.320
That one's dead.

369
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:46.758
Hurry.

370
00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:47.959
But Father and Uncle.

371
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.795
Oh, you see a doting
father and uncle,

372
00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:52.097
but those men were
warriors, the very best,

373
00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:53.531
and that does not change.

374
00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:55.533
You'll pity for the
wretches that attacked us.

375
00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:57.069
And they will join us soon.

376
00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:05.576
Look, over here.

377
00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:06.412
Quick, hide.

378
00:29:06.413 --> 00:29:07.512
- Oh.
- Wait for them.

379
00:29:07.513 --> 00:29:08.613
I must go back for the others.

380
00:29:08.614 --> 00:29:09.848
You're just like your father.

381
00:29:09.849 --> 00:29:11.282
Did you not hear what I
just said to your sis.

382
00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:12.218
Hilda.

383
00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:13.052
Hilda.

384
00:29:13.053 --> 00:29:14.152
Hilda.

385
00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.594
Where is my daughter?

386
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.630
Where is my daughter?

387
00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:42.147
Go.

388
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:53.925
I'll catch you next time, boy.

389
00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:55.861
And there will be a next time.

390
00:29:55.862 --> 00:29:57.728
I am no boy.

391
00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.497
Where is she?

392
00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:01.867
Where is my sister?

393
00:30:01.868 --> 00:30:02.868
Come back.

394
00:30:05.371 --> 00:30:06.371
Mother.

395
00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:10.141
Hilda.

396
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.143
Hilda.

397
00:30:22.288 --> 00:30:23.889
Mother.

398
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:24.890
Mother.

399
00:30:27.293 --> 00:30:29.194
Pull yourself together.

400
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:30.561
We will find her,

401
00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:32.563
but we must get the others.

402
00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:36.434
I promise you, we will
have those savages gutted

403
00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:38.437
and begging Oden
for forgiveness.

404
00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:42.807
Let me say a prayer.

405
00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:50.149
Oh mighty, oh
father, mighty Oden,

406
00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:52.584
keep my daughter safe.

407
00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:59.857
Keep my daughter safe, lord,
until we meet again here.

408
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:00.858
Hear Oden.

409
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:04.030
Hilda, oh my Hilda.

410
00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:11.569
Please, mighty oh
father, protect my baby.

411
00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:20.445
Gro.

412
00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:44.569
Hey boys, wait there,
I'm coming for you.

413
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.880
I wished this morning
that I'd have the chance

414
00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:57.883
to kill two soft-hands at once.

415
00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:02.787
It seems my dreams
have been answered.

416
00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:06.024
I'll enjoy draping your
skins over my shoulders.

417
00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:07.358
Soft-hands?

418
00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:08.626
Have you any idea who we are,

419
00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:10.429
you stinking glove
of cock cheese?

420
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:14.699
Gunnar.

421
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.800
Yeah?

422
00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:17.103
Shut up and fight.

423
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.771
Oh, yes, of course.

424
00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:27.412
You.

425
00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:39.090
Come on.

426
00:32:39.091 --> 00:32:40.525
Come on.

427
00:32:40.526 --> 00:32:41.526
That's it.

428
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:55.534
Big, but no brains.

429
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.307
Where will we be in
generations to come?

430
00:34:02.308 --> 00:34:04.409
In 20 generations?

431
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.212
Descendants of brutal heathens

432
00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:10.182
obsessed with cult followings,
by the looks of it.

433
00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:16.221
We need to catch
up with the others.

434
00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:20.525
These Berserkers must
know we're traveling West.

435
00:34:20.526 --> 00:34:24.562
I really wish everyone would
stop calling 'em Berserkers.

436
00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:27.398
We fought with Berserkers,
they're good men,

437
00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:32.337
other than the parts
where they went berserk.

438
00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:35.107
How did they know where we were?

439
00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:38.210
Maybe they have
something we don't.

440
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.148
Enough rest, lazy brother.

441
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:45.450
We need to catch
up with the others.

442
00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:52.923
Father.

443
00:34:56.762 --> 00:34:57.762
Where's Hilda?

444
00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:02.833
Where's Hilda?

445
00:35:18.517 --> 00:35:20.418
You are the daughter
of the wicked man

446
00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:22.520
who killed my husband.

447
00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:24.756
Father is no wicked man.

448
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:27.492
He is gentle.

449
00:35:27.493 --> 00:35:29.895
Gentle enough to
behead by one true love?

450
00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:33.499
Miss. I am deeply
sorry for your loss,

451
00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:37.168
but I assure you that
anything my father did,

452
00:35:37.169 --> 00:35:39.705
he only did to
protect his family.

453
00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.874
What about my family?

454
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.376
Do you call those barbarians

455
00:35:45.377 --> 00:35:47.145
that dragged me
here, your family?

456
00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:52.150
They're only human until they
meet their gods, of course.

457
00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:56.821
I'm very fortunate to
have bared two sons,

458
00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:58.290
no daughter, thank the wolf.

459
00:35:59.558 --> 00:36:01.826
You're a pathetic
excuse for a warrior.

460
00:36:01.827 --> 00:36:03.694
I am no warrior.

461
00:36:03.695 --> 00:36:05.431
I don't wanna play your games.

462
00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:08.667
I just wanna be
an ordinary girl.

463
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:11.902
Hence why I'm lucky
to have no daughter.

464
00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:15.039
Please, I don't wanna fight.

465
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.475
You have no choice, darling.

466
00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:19.644
Besides, it's only recent

467
00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:20.945
that women were
allowed in the games,

468
00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:22.713
I believe you
should be thankful.

469
00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:24.782
I believe in the unity of human.

470
00:36:24.783 --> 00:36:27.586
Like I said, we won't
be humans forever.

471
00:36:28.754 --> 00:36:32.223
We are the animals
that stalk the Earth,

472
00:36:32.224 --> 00:36:33.959
the howling in the night.

473
00:36:36.094 --> 00:36:38.128
You are no animals.

474
00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:40.565
Perhaps one day the world
will be more enlightened.

475
00:36:40.566 --> 00:36:42.000
How can you do this?

476
00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:45.771
You feel pain, you bleed.

477
00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:50.708
You've had two children
and you survived.

478
00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:53.511
Life is a gift
given by the gods.

479
00:36:53.512 --> 00:36:55.213
Not by your gods.

480
00:36:56.648 --> 00:37:00.017
We have suffered many
winters and summers,

481
00:37:00.018 --> 00:37:01.486
finding our place in this world

482
00:37:01.487 --> 00:37:04.121
through the primal
wisdom of the great bear.

483
00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:06.558
- I don't understand.
- I don't expect you to.

484
00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:16.568
I was younger than you

485
00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:21.739
when the Vikings stormed
into my land, my village,

486
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.310
taking anything they
wanted, like me.

487
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:29.881
Burning everything they
didn't, like my brothers.

488
00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:33.218
I can't even remember
their names anymore.

489
00:37:36.288 --> 00:37:38.255
The only one who
showed me any kindness

490
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:41.592
was the man your father
would call a Berserker.

491
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:44.094
The dirty warriors
for the dirty jobs,

492
00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.864
the insane, the remorseless.

493
00:37:48.434 --> 00:37:53.505
He found me with three
supposedly noble vikings

494
00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:55.507
taking turns on me.

495
00:37:56.742 --> 00:37:59.378
And he ripped them apart,

496
00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:04.783
and he took me away, fed
me, clothed me, let me heal.

497
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:08.319
He didn't even try to touch me

498
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.456
until I made it clear
that I wanted it.

499
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:14.259
His name was Amleth.

500
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.632
One man's villain is
another one's hero.

501
00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:24.836
Why did your husband
hate my father?

502
00:38:28.407 --> 00:38:30.608
You asked me about giving birth.

503
00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:33.744
When Finnr came out of
me, I was 13-years-old.

504
00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:35.980
I was lying, bleeding,

505
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:38.816
torn open on the
floor of a dark cave.

506
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:40.851
Three things kept me alive,

507
00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:44.188
Amleth, by my side,
holding my hand,

508
00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:47.425
love, for my baby and
the animal spirits world

509
00:38:47.426 --> 00:38:52.498
and hate, for you,
naive, fairytale-loving,

510
00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.566
soft-handed heathens.

511
00:38:57.469 --> 00:38:59.771
The same when Bodil
ripped his way out.

512
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.176
Amleth returned from war,
simply to hold my hand.

513
00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:11.417
And where is he now?

514
00:39:23.562 --> 00:39:25.763
Which way did they take her?

515
00:39:25.764 --> 00:39:27.932
They went North, I think.

516
00:39:27.933 --> 00:39:29.099
You think?

517
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.334
There were men

518
00:39:30.335 --> 00:39:32.770
trying to lop my head
off at the time, Uncle.

519
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:34.606
Sorry, boy, you did good.

520
00:39:35.874 --> 00:39:37.142
We just need to be sure.

521
00:39:38.844 --> 00:39:41.780
North, the death field.

522
00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:44.449
I must save her.

523
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.783
Let me go with you, Father.

524
00:39:45.784 --> 00:39:47.217
No.

525
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.419
Why?

526
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.687
Two reasons.

527
00:39:49.688 --> 00:39:54.224
First, one man alone,
I can go in, sneak in,

528
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.495
as quiet as an ant's farm.

529
00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.331
Second, your mother
and I need you here.

530
00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:05.704
Keep traveling West,
towards the coast.

531
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:10.407
I will catch up
you and with Hilda.

532
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:11.942
Yes,

533
00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:14.044
you and Hilda.

534
00:40:14.045 --> 00:40:15.245
Unharmed.

535
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.815
You and Hilda.

536
00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:22.621
We will conquer this.

537
00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:26.324
Any last jokes before
I leave, Brother?

538
00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:29.461
Hardly the right
time or place is it?

539
00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:33.798
God, you're so
inappropriate, Brother.

540
00:40:33.799 --> 00:40:34.800
Very embarrassing.

541
00:41:10.502 --> 00:41:11.503
I need to piss.

542
00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:19.644
He's good with a sword.

543
00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:21.046
You should have seen him.

544
00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.250
I didn't know whether to be
proud or scared for his soul.

545
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:27.786
Have you been teaching him?

546
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.556
Ander told me not to,
no matter how he begged.

547
00:41:31.557 --> 00:41:32.891
Then it's in his blood.

548
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.460
And he has taught himself.

549
00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:37.695
Where'd he get that sword then?

550
00:41:37.696 --> 00:41:40.065
He's of age, he bought
it with his own coin.

551
00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.200
Has he?

552
00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:44.201
What?

553
00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:46.537
Felt the rage?

554
00:41:46.538 --> 00:41:47.805
Not that I have seen,

555
00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:50.909
but I know that it is
inside, Gro, within him.

556
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.912
I can hear you talking about me.

557
00:41:54.913 --> 00:41:58.616
Yeah, talking about
you, not to you.

558
00:41:58.617 --> 00:42:00.752
March on, one, two,
three, one, two, three.

559
00:42:03.288 --> 00:42:06.558
Freda always had the power
to keep my rage in check.

560
00:42:07.492 --> 00:42:08.660
She was like a tonic.

561
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:12.663
How do you keep it in
check now that she's gone?

562
00:42:12.664 --> 00:42:15.566
Well why do you think
I always stayed near her?

563
00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:17.501
Thanks to you and Ander,

564
00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:19.170
I know she's always with me now.

565
00:42:22.741 --> 00:42:25.611
Hence, calm as a summer wind.

566
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:28.779
Even in the heat of battle,

567
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.216
I always can hear
her voice of reason.

568
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.819
She does go on though.

569
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.887
Yack, yack, yack, yack, yack.

570
00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:37.888
Same as ever.

571
00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:41.259
Quiet.

572
00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.292
What is it?

573
00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:43.728
I sense danger.

574
00:42:43.729 --> 00:42:46.131
What, are you
clairvoyant now, boy?

575
00:42:47.032 --> 00:42:48.800
I doubt he has such a power.

576
00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:54.304
Worshiping false
gods, as you all do.

577
00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:58.309
Oh, it's all right,
it's just a few animals.

578
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.411
Have you met Gudrind?

579
00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:02.512
Some of your pals have,

580
00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:04.582
but they're a bit
dead to tell the tale.

581
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.385
Animals, aren't we all?

582
00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:11.121
Like the man call
Ander, for example.

583
00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:13.191
He's one but the great beasts.

584
00:43:13.992 --> 00:43:15.593
You too, his brother.

585
00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:17.562
I forget your name.

586
00:43:18.864 --> 00:43:20.397
Don't worry.

587
00:43:20.398 --> 00:43:23.367
I'll soon hammer it
into your memory.

588
00:43:23.368 --> 00:43:24.469
A witty one too.

589
00:43:26.137 --> 00:43:28.472
Remember boys, I
want them alive.

590
00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:29.473
That's funny.

591
00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:32.844
I was just thinking
the opposite about you.

592
00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.216
Just a warmup for
the games to come.

593
00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:16.754
Get him.

594
00:44:19.524 --> 00:44:22.259
You too afraid to fight
me by yourself Finnr?

595
00:44:24.629 --> 00:44:25.896
He's mine.

596
00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:48.478
Coward.

597
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.416
Let us go.

598
00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:57.754
Do you have any idea how
silly a request that is?

599
00:45:59.925 --> 00:46:02.259
I mean, I literally
came all this way

600
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.628
just to come and take you.

601
00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:05.831
Why would I let you go?

602
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:15.305
How pathetic.

603
00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:17.908
I've seen birds make
much of an effort

604
00:46:17.909 --> 00:46:19.477
just to continue forth.

605
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:21.812
I won't let you hurt them.

606
00:46:21.813 --> 00:46:23.281
And how would you stop me?

607
00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:29.586
Imagine what Freda will
say if she saw you now.

608
00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:31.256
How dare he say her name, you.

609
00:46:34.826 --> 00:46:37.395
Ah, Gunnar, that's the one.

610
00:46:38.363 --> 00:46:39.363
That's the name.

611
00:46:41.432 --> 00:46:43.400
You have no use in my games.

612
00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:46.203
I just wish you the best.

613
00:46:46.204 --> 00:46:47.537
A place in the afterlife

614
00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:51.608
and hopefully the
forgiveness of the true gods.

615
00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:54.544
A blissful, eternal existence

616
00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:56.681
next to your beloved Freda.

617
00:46:57.582 --> 00:46:59.217
Had to say name again, huh?

618
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.792
Your main use now is to
set an example for these two,

619
00:47:08.593 --> 00:47:09.860
to show them what happens

620
00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:14.364
when someone disobey
my father's wishes.

621
00:47:14.365 --> 00:47:18.102
No, please, please, no.

622
00:47:18.103 --> 00:47:20.738
Please, please, no, no, please.

623
00:47:24.275 --> 00:47:26.743
It's all right, it's all right.

624
00:47:26.744 --> 00:47:28.445
It's gonna be all right.

625
00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:32.650
Gro, make sure you lynch these
fools for your uncle, huh.

626
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.687
You hear me, you little shit.

627
00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.089
Stop.

628
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.090
Stop.

629
00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:42.960
You piece of shit.

630
00:47:42.961 --> 00:47:44.261
No, please.

631
00:48:09.454 --> 00:48:13.925
Now, simple question, even
an old lady can understand.

632
00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.226
Where is my star competitor?

633
00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:18.829
I'll never tell you.

634
00:48:20.365 --> 00:48:24.201
Where is Ander?

635
00:48:43.621 --> 00:48:45.223
The man who killed my father.

636
00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:50.027
I bet you thought I'd be
easy compared to my brother.

637
00:48:50.028 --> 00:48:51.661
That's what everyone thinks.

638
00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:54.698
I've never even thought
anything about you.

639
00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:56.866
I don't even know
your name, boy.

640
00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:00.037
Bodil, the last
name you'll ever hear.

641
00:49:00.038 --> 00:49:01.505
Lucky me.

642
00:49:01.506 --> 00:49:04.774
I thought your brother was
the one with the stupid tongue.

643
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.211
My brother's not here.

644
00:49:07.912 --> 00:49:08.912
True.

645
00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:31.101
Father.

646
00:49:31.102 --> 00:49:32.037
My son.

647
00:49:32.038 --> 00:49:33.438
Tell me this is a nightmare.

648
00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:37.574
It would be a gift from
the Old Father if it was.

649
00:49:37.575 --> 00:49:38.975
This is for my fault.

650
00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:40.410
It's all my fault.

651
00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:43.213
No, not my angel,

652
00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:45.249
this is far from your fault.

653
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.684
No, it is, it is.

654
00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:51.721
No, it is them and them alone.

655
00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:52.757
No, them and I.

656
00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:55.825
I don't understand, Father,

657
00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:58.428
what exactly did you do
to make this your fault?

658
00:49:58.429 --> 00:49:59.530
Amleth and I.

659
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:03.333
Gunnar?

660
00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:06.236
Gunnar?

661
00:50:07.272 --> 00:50:10.241
Oh yes, Uncle, he'll
save us, silly Uncle.

662
00:50:14.045 --> 00:50:16.146
Where's my brother, Hilda?

663
00:50:16.147 --> 00:50:18.249
Gro, where is my brother?

664
00:50:20.085 --> 00:50:21.086
Finnr got him.

665
00:50:24.622 --> 00:50:26.757
Sorry Father, we did
everything we could.

666
00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:33.297
I know you did.

667
00:50:33.298 --> 00:50:34.732
I know you did.

668
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.476
Boy, you, I have a question.

669
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.546
Ander this isn't going to help.

670
00:50:49.647 --> 00:50:51.415
What do you want?

671
00:50:51.416 --> 00:50:54.618
I told you I have a question.

672
00:50:54.619 --> 00:50:56.253
Go on.

673
00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:59.189
When you're all done sucking
off each other's cheesy cocks

674
00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:03.327
and moving on to the torment
of innocent women and children,

675
00:51:03.328 --> 00:51:05.595
do you ever stop and wipe
the jizz from your face

676
00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:09.200
and think, "Am I the bad guy?

677
00:51:10.535 --> 00:51:13.370
"Am I really more
worthless than pig shit

678
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:15.140
"on the bottom of my boot?"

679
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:19.075
Do you ever wonder what
your whore mother must think

680
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:20.044
if she could see you.

681
00:51:20.045 --> 00:51:22.312
I ought to bleed you out

682
00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:23.547
with your precious family.

683
00:51:23.548 --> 00:51:25.950
No, no, leave us
be, leave us me.

684
00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:28.753
Everyone, calm down.

685
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:32.157
I'm finished making my point.

686
00:51:33.558 --> 00:51:34.459
How about it?

687
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.494
You versus me.

688
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:40.598
Take these chains off,
let's see what happens.

689
00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:44.334
I've been bleeding for hours.

690
00:51:44.335 --> 00:51:45.470
I'm getting old.

691
00:51:46.871 --> 00:51:47.871
How about it?

692
00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:50.307
No, Father.

693
00:51:50.308 --> 00:51:52.809
It would be the most
honorable thing you have done

694
00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:56.313
since you let your father
sodomize you for half price.

695
00:51:56.314 --> 00:51:58.548
Leave those fools.

696
00:51:58.549 --> 00:52:01.318
Permission to disempower
his man before the games.

697
00:52:01.319 --> 00:52:02.786
Denied.

698
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:05.855
What do you think my brother
would say if I let you do that?

699
00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.424
Now go.

700
00:52:07.425 --> 00:52:08.425
Aye, Sir.

701
00:52:14.332 --> 00:52:16.934
So how are we all feeling?

702
00:52:18.536 --> 00:52:19.804
I'll offer you a deal.

703
00:52:23.208 --> 00:52:27.011
Let my family go and you can
do whatever you want with me.

704
00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:31.215
And I'll do something for you.

705
00:52:31.216 --> 00:52:32.816
And what's that?

706
00:52:32.817 --> 00:52:34.618
I'll kill you quick.

707
00:52:37.422 --> 00:52:39.590
You are amusing.

708
00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:42.493
No pain, I promise you.

709
00:52:43.661 --> 00:52:47.464
That is tempting but
Finnr would not approve.

710
00:52:47.465 --> 00:52:49.132
Finnr?

711
00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:51.335
How does it feel
to be second fill

712
00:52:51.336 --> 00:52:53.870
to a little temper tantrum?

713
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:55.572
You're what, three
years younger?

714
00:52:55.573 --> 00:52:57.607
And he gets the
keys to the kingdom.

715
00:52:57.608 --> 00:53:00.176
Surely you have some
say in this madness.

716
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:02.880
I will not let you
get inside my head.

717
00:53:03.648 --> 00:53:05.350
I love my brother

718
00:53:06.484 --> 00:53:11.389
and I love this, what
you call, madness.

719
00:53:13.524 --> 00:53:14.524
If you're sure.

720
00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:17.395
Have you ever seen a monkey?

721
00:53:20.164 --> 00:53:21.465
I have not.

722
00:53:21.466 --> 00:53:22.767
Amazing creatures.

723
00:53:23.868 --> 00:53:26.803
Like little tiny furry people.

724
00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:30.140
Me and my brother saw them
during the wars in the far East.

725
00:53:31.276 --> 00:53:33.877
You make a gesture
and they copy you.

726
00:53:33.878 --> 00:53:35.912
What is your point?

727
00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:40.083
My point is you
copy your brother,

728
00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:41.451
you're the monkey.

729
00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:43.086
Shut up.

730
00:53:43.087 --> 00:53:44.722
Stand up and be a man.

731
00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:51.629
Take me.

732
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:53.431
Let them go.

733
00:54:28.466 --> 00:54:30.134
I'm taking part in the games.

734
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:34.270
Mother, you are a woman.

735
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.271
I am.

736
00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:39.976
So that's why two shitting,
screaming balls of joy

737
00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:42.479
fell out of my body
all those years ago.

738
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.047
You know what I mean.

739
00:54:44.048 --> 00:54:45.482
Father's changed the rule

740
00:54:45.483 --> 00:54:48.385
to see more variety of
gritting down for our cause,

741
00:54:48.386 --> 00:54:51.321
not for his own woman
to get vanquished.

742
00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:54.023
And how is that fair to me?

743
00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:55.291
It isn't.

744
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:57.561
For you must be paid.

745
00:54:57.562 --> 00:54:59.596
Doesn't our faith
encourage bloodshed

746
00:54:59.597 --> 00:55:00.797
from all who follow it?

747
00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:03.800
I'm not saying you're
not capable, Mother.

748
00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:06.437
I'm just saying it's
not worth the risk.

749
00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.373
What risk?

750
00:55:09.374 --> 00:55:11.976
Against some dainty
soft-hand whore?

751
00:55:12.777 --> 00:55:14.078
I fight.

752
00:55:35.633 --> 00:55:37.767
Mother will
compete in the games.

753
00:55:37.768 --> 00:55:39.736
She deserve to feed her thirst.

754
00:55:39.737 --> 00:55:41.138
This is very last minute.

755
00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:44.974
No, it was always
going to happen.

756
00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:46.877
It's just now I'm telling you.

757
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.347
I respectfully disagree.

758
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:52.882
You what?

759
00:55:52.883 --> 00:55:55.986
I am my father's son
and I will have my say.

760
00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:59.424
This clan would fall
apart without you.

761
00:56:00.525 --> 00:56:02.727
It will be without
me one day anyway.

762
00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:05.963
It's an unacceptable risk.

763
00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:09.633
What, just because I'm
a few some years younger

764
00:56:09.634 --> 00:56:11.601
means I don't get my say?

765
00:56:11.602 --> 00:56:16.139
Oh sweet Bodil, of
course you get a say

766
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.141
and I've heard you.

767
00:56:18.142 --> 00:56:20.878
And your concern
means a great deal.

768
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.314
But it's two votes against one.

769
00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:30.354
Ander's whore, the
mother, she's mine.

770
00:56:40.297 --> 00:56:45.369
Never question me and
never question Mother again.

771
00:56:46.036 --> 00:56:47.036
Do you understand?

772
00:56:48.305 --> 00:56:49.739
Good.

773
00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:19.136
Father, when these
morons bound me,

774
00:57:20.004 --> 00:57:21.672
I managed to tense my wrists.

775
00:57:22.707 --> 00:57:24.174
It gave me a little
bit of slack.

776
00:57:31.415 --> 00:57:36.086
And now I think I'm
just about free.

777
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.691
Now your sister.

778
00:57:42.059 --> 00:57:44.528
South of here is
a harbor with boats.

779
00:57:44.529 --> 00:57:45.462
They took our coin.

780
00:57:45.463 --> 00:57:46.996
I'll think of something.

781
00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.469
We sail, destination anywhere.

782
00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:56.272
The guard's coming.

783
00:57:56.273 --> 00:57:57.974
Go, go, go, go.

784
00:57:57.975 --> 00:57:59.108
You too, go.

785
00:57:59.109 --> 00:58:00.877
Take her and then go.

786
00:58:00.878 --> 00:58:02.546
There's no time.

787
00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:06.883
Where?

788
00:58:06.884 --> 00:58:11.154
On the way, there's an inn
with a green thatch roof, go.

789
00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:12.689
Oy.

790
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.257
Go, go.

791
00:58:14.258 --> 00:58:15.859
Go.

792
00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:43.687
Quick, hide.

793
00:58:43.688 --> 00:58:44.521
No, no, no, no, no.

794
00:58:44.522 --> 00:58:46.122
Just there, trust me.

795
00:58:46.123 --> 00:58:48.324
Trust in your brother.

796
00:58:57.434 --> 00:58:59.103
I can smell their fear.

797
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:02.505
So you think you're
the wolf, Venres?

798
00:59:02.506 --> 00:59:04.674
I'm telling you I
can smell their fear.

799
00:59:04.675 --> 00:59:05.843
Then you're a fool.

800
00:59:07.077 --> 00:59:08.645
They went that way.

801
00:59:08.646 --> 00:59:10.947
I'm telling you,
the girls over here.

802
00:59:10.948 --> 00:59:16.020
I can smell her.

803
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.956
I can hear you, boy.

804
00:59:19.957 --> 00:59:21.791
I am no boy.

805
00:59:21.792 --> 00:59:23.427
I think last time proved that.

806
00:59:24.962 --> 00:59:26.330
You want a rematch.

807
00:59:27.732 --> 00:59:30.400
I wouldn't expect a savage
like you to fight fair.

808
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:34.138
I don't need this to beat you.

809
01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:12.976
Hilda.

810
01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:28.324
Oh no, I've gotta
leave you alive, boy.

811
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.530
Lucky you.

812
01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:47.544
Shh, hush girly.

813
01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:49.679
Remember me?

814
01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:53.883
You have plenty of
time to scream later.

815
01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:55.919
We missed you, you know.

816
01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:13.803
No.

817
01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.471
There you go, boy.

818
01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:18.074
Mommy and daddy have missed you.

819
01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:19.776
He's a good scrapper.

820
01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:20.911
Thorvald was lucky.

821
01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:25.481
Ah, Mother, I wasn't expecting
to see you again so soon.

822
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.816
Your sister?

823
01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:28.417
I dunno.

824
01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.419
She kept going.

825
01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:31.587
I think she's fine.

826
01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.089
Oh, pray to the Old Father.

827
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:36.293
Pray to Estrid, she
wants a word with you.

828
01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.451
You're like my
husband in some ways,

829
01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.153
a powerful animal.

830
01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.122
I'm nothing like him.

831
01:02:06.123 --> 01:02:07.524
You don't have his honor.

832
01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.526
You act all high and mighty

833
01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:13.729
but we know different, don't we?

834
01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:17.266
I did nothing to you.

835
01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.267
That's right.

836
01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:21.971
You did nothing.

837
01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:27.944
I'm sorry.

838
01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:30.114
For what?

839
01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:33.549
I'm sorry I didn't stop him.

840
01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:37.054
Vikings will be Vikings, right?

841
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.257
Does your wife know

842
01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.561
why Amleth hated Ander,
the coward, so very much?

843
01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:49.565
I'm surprised you told her
anything about the wars.

844
01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.268
When Olga found us,
she had a right to know.

845
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.972
The Viking way,
rape and pillage.

846
01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:57.273
I didn't.

847
01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:59.143
You didn't stop
them, Amleth did.

848
01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:05.849
You took my village,
burned it to the ground.

849
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.651
Amleth played his part.

850
01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:10.454
But he would never hurt me.

851
01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:16.692
You stood there
watching, doing nothing.

852
01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:18.227
I wasn't this man then,

853
01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:21.498
I was barely even more
than a child myself.

854
01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.835
You were holding your
god's given rage inside

855
01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:27.103
while three of your comrades

856
01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:30.307
violated this little
girl over and over.

857
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.643
There was nothing I could do.

858
01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.644
Liar.

859
01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.115
Coward liar.

860
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.152
Do you imagine your little
girl in my position?

861
01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.756
Every time I remember it,

862
01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:51.428
if I had touched 'em

863
01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:55.031
it would've been treason.

864
01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.832
I had a bride in waiting,

865
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.402
we were going to have a family.

866
01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.170
I had a family.

867
01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:07.677
You could do nothing,
but Amleth did.

868
01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:13.984
My love, my hero, my beautiful
dirty teenage Berserker,

869
01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:18.422
cut them down as you
watched, frozen in fear.

870
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:23.826
I remember his eyes

871
01:04:23.827 --> 01:04:26.463
cutting through me
like burning arrows.

872
01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.936
I remember my hand on my hip.

873
01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:39.076
And I wondered if I even had
the right to defend myself.

874
01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:42.611
But he made no move to you.

875
01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:47.684
The Berserker just stared
as he carried you away.

876
01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:49.085
And.

877
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.288
And?

878
01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:58.595
And I reported him for
insubordination and desertion.

879
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.400
No matter.

880
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.271
He was done with your
petty wars anyway,

881
01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.140
ready for his own wars.

882
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:14.544
And soon I had a new family.

883
01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:19.715
And the promise that one
day, when the time was right,

884
01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:23.253
my love would destroy you
and everything you loved.

885
01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:25.788
Please.

886
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.257
I beg you Estrid.

887
01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:34.264
Now that promise
comes to pass, finally.

888
01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:38.135
Soon the animal spirits will
reward us beyond measure.

889
01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.809
Now my son will have
a word with you.

890
01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:49.745
In a strange way, I thank
you for his existence.

891
01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:51.581
He knows?

892
01:05:51.582 --> 01:05:53.082
Of course.

893
01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:56.085
Unlike you, I don't keep
secrets from my children.

894
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.559
The man who took my father

895
01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:38.862
and ignored the
lamentation of my mother.

896
01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:42.166
If it's guilt you
want me to feel,

897
01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:47.104
I've already felt
a life's worth.

898
01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.074
Oh poor you.

899
01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:55.678
I tried so hard to make amends

900
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:58.448
with all horrors of
the past, of war.

901
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:03.486
I tried to tell your father
this but he wouldn't listen.

902
01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:05.288
But you can.

903
01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:09.192
You'd have me deny
my father's wishes,

904
01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:11.228
his own noble religion?

905
01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:17.200
Any nobility your religion had,

906
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:21.604
Amleth and his followers
perverted it into a blood cult.

907
01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:24.007
Pig shit, after pig shit.

908
01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.443
It's sad because we both know

909
01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:30.914
that in another life
you'd be one of us.

910
01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:36.353
Maybe you are right.

911
01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:39.856
Maybe I am like your father.

912
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.293
But in reverse.

913
01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:46.263
What do you mean?

914
01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.033
I tried to become a better man.

915
01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:55.438
But as he willingly
became worse,

916
01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:59.976
any goodness left in him, he
squeezed 'til it was dead.

917
01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:03.479
My father was a pioneer.

918
01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.816
He soared with the birds even
before his spirit joined them,

919
01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:08.918
before you took him.

920
01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.690
I feel your pain, Finnr.

921
01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:20.230
But can't you see all this
just causes more and more pain.

922
01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.367
I merely follow the god's will.

923
01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.902
Amleth's will.

924
01:08:26.903 --> 01:08:28.572
Same thing.

925
01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:32.576
The sacrifices you and
your kin will provide.

926
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.710
Why my god's will.

927
01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.679
Ah, your gods are a myth.

928
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.680
Blasphemy.

929
01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.553
Perhaps my gods are also a myth.

930
01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:47.557
Old one idol enough for far.

931
01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:52.196
Maybe all there is, is us,

932
01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:56.633
humans, people.

933
01:08:58.902 --> 01:09:00.269
Oh my,

934
01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.906
you'll even stoop to
your own idea of heresy.

935
01:09:05.275 --> 01:09:09.378
I feel great joy seeing
you watching your children

936
01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:10.379
bleed and beg.

937
01:09:16.019 --> 01:09:17.086
There he is,

938
01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:19.855
just the taste, but there he is.

939
01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.925
You know why my father
really hated you?

940
01:09:22.726 --> 01:09:24.493
The rage.

941
01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:26.829
He saw it in you
on the battlefield.

942
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.997
Like a true Berserker.

943
01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:31.033
It's not that you
didn't save my mother,

944
01:09:31.034 --> 01:09:32.635
it's that you could have,

945
01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:34.504
if you only embraced the rage.

946
01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:40.843
But you deny it, and that's
what makes your coward.

947
01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.848
Perhaps you'll do
well to think on this,

948
01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.783
as you prepare for battle.

949
01:09:47.784 --> 01:09:50.152
I'll see you on the battlefield.

950
01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:35.464
Enough.

951
01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:45.475
Remaining brothers, leaders,

952
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.378
this is not the
turnout Amleth wanted,

953
01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:54.518
but his spirit flies over us
watching, enjoying this day.

954
01:10:55.519 --> 01:10:57.286
These prisoners try to run

955
01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.855
and our brothers will shoot
them down in the woods,

956
01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:00.857
with the arrows.

957
01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:14.203
Did they do anything to you?

958
01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.342
What are we going to do?

959
01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.577
We fight.

960
01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.882
We fight and we win.

961
01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:37.827
Here we are, Olga.

962
01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:42.197
I look forward to
tearing you apart.

963
01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.100
Shut up bitch and
get ready to die.

964
01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:46.201
We shall see.

965
01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:31.714
Mother.

966
01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.252
Finnr.

967
01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.354
Mother.

968
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:43.125
Shh, show some spine
in front of your people.

969
01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.660
Mother, wait.

970
01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:46.996
But.

971
01:12:46.997 --> 01:12:48.230
This is the games.

972
01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:51.066
This is what our parents want.

973
01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:52.067
You understand?

974
01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:58.941
Thank you.

975
01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:11.988
They're together now, forever.

976
01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:25.601
Isn't this where you beg
for mercy like your father?

977
01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.170
"I don't want to
die, I want peace."

978
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:31.373
No, I was hoping to
finish off your brother.

979
01:13:31.374 --> 01:13:32.841
But I guess I will have to deal

980
01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:35.244
with the runt of the
litter instead, huh?

981
01:14:18.555 --> 01:14:19.555
Go on.

982
01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:20.556
Do it.

983
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:23.091
You want me to
send you to Valhalla?

984
01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:24.292
Yeah.

985
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.194
You want to run with
the wolves, Bodil?

986
01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.195
Yes.

987
01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:29.464
- Send him to the gods.
- Come on.

988
01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.733
Come on.
Come on.

989
01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:31.767
Come on.

990
01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:32.768
Do it.

991
01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:35.604
No.

992
01:14:36.673 --> 01:14:39.576
I am too old for fairytales.

993
01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:54.923
- Go.
- Come on.

994
01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:55.759
Get him.

995
01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:56.593
Take him down.

996
01:14:56.594 --> 01:14:58.527
Choke him, choke him.

997
01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:00.529
Go boy, go on get him.

998
01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

999
01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:05.601
Finish it.

1000
01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:26.722
Finish him, do it.

1001
01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:27.791
Finish it.

1002
01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.526
- Do it.
- Finish it.

1003
01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.863
- Do it.
- Finish him.

1004
01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.467
Finish him yourself.

1005
01:15:44.007 --> 01:15:45.274
I can't feel anything.

1006
01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:51.180
I'm proud of you.

1007
01:16:02.626 --> 01:16:04.092
Finnr.

1008
01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:05.093
Hey boy.

1009
01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:09.598
Even your father, even Estrid,

1010
01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:11.700
thinks your pathetic for this.

1011
01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:14.369
Even they wouldn't
consider this sport.

1012
01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:17.306
There are no way classes
in the games, Ander.

1013
01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.876
This is an equal
opportunity blood sport.

1014
01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:23.979
How is this equal?

1015
01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:28.752
You believe they're
watching you, don't you?

1016
01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:31.854
Yes.

1017
01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:35.257
You believe, don't you?

1018
01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:36.692
Come on.

1019
01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:37.927
You versus me.

1020
01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:41.764
Now that would be a fair fight.

1021
01:16:41.765 --> 01:16:43.531
Silence.

1022
01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.700
No, please Father.

1023
01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.101
No, no, no, no.

1024
01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.302
Father.
Come on.

1025
01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:50.906
Are you a bear or
are you chicken shit?

1026
01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:53.108
What do you say Finnr?

1027
01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.310
Father, no, no, no, no, no.

1028
01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:59.682
I've done done many things
in my life that are very wrong.

1029
01:16:59.683 --> 01:17:00.683
But this,

1030
01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:02.851
this is not one of them.

1031
01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:05.821
And I will tell you all
about them real soon.

1032
01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:07.389
Please Father.

1033
01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.726
Do you trust your father?

1034
01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:14.630
Then give me that sword

1035
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.933
and go sit by your mother.

1036
01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.275
I will see you in a minute.

1037
01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:30.178
Come on.

1038
01:17:42.726 --> 01:17:44.392
Father.

1039
01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:45.393
Father, get up.

1040
01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:48.931
Father.

1041
01:17:58.441 --> 01:17:59.607
Get up.

1042
01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:00.608
Who's your king?

1043
01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.260
Ready to die, Ander?

1044
01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.432
Father was right as ever.

1045
01:19:30.934 --> 01:19:31.934
Send me to him.

1046
01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.838
Send me to him or you
will never stop running.

1047
01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.740
Do you hear me?

1048
01:19:38.741 --> 01:19:39.741
Do you?

1049
01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:44.080
For Gunnar.
