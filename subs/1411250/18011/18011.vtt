00:01:56,473 --> 00:02:03,322
THE ROAD TO SANTIAGO 
(At the End of the Road)

2
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:06,284
Look, I don't feel like it, José.

3
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,480
-Yes.
-No.

4
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:08,356
-Yes.
-No.

5
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:10,914
As soon as you see them
you'll feel like it.

6
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:12,353
Blah, blah.

7
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:14,715
These two look like models.

8
00:02:14,913 --> 00:02:17,200
Right now, I'd rather be alone.

9
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:20,044
- What do you mean?
- Alone, thinking about things.

10
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,235
That's not being alone,
that's being an asshole.

11
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:23,515
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:26,603
They're really hot,
and if you want to forget her...

13
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,273
- Don't even mention her.
- I won't.

14
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:30,599
But, two things.

15
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:33,564
First, everybody's been dumped
some time.

16
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:36,884
You're not the first one.

17
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,724
And second...

18
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,919
Hey!

19
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:42,600
José?

20
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:44,320
What's the second?

21
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,323
The second is that
these girls are different.

22
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:48,958
Listen, Nacho,

23
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:51,076
they're not your typical bimbos.

24
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:52,604
The girls tonight

25
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,154
are students.

26
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:56,799
Why are you in my shower?
I can hear you perfectly.

27
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,121
No, you can't.
You haven't heard me

28
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,680
since you split up,
and that hurts me.

29
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:04,160
Know why?
Because I'm your friend.

30
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:06,523
And I love you.

31
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,281
I'm no fag,
but I love you, OK?

32
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:10,281
OK.

33
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,635
So what do they study?

34
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:42,559
But

35
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,682
we've just been in bed.

36
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,639
That's irrelevant.

37
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,881
How can it be irrelevant?

38
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:50,996
You screw me at 9:00,

39
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:53,673
and at 9:45 you say
you want to leave me?

40
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:56,160
Couldn't you have
thought about it sooner?

41
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,594
- That's not what I said.
- So what did you say?

42
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,478
Try to understand, Pilar.

43
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,283
I'm immobilized,

44
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:03,804
paralyzed.

45
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,559
I realized this weekend
in the chairlift at Cerler.

46
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:09,438
What did you realize? What?

47
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:11,513
I'm in a crisis.

48
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:15,644
Look, are you leaving me or not?

49
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,164
Please, don't hassle me.

50
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:21,358
After three years, can't you tell me
if you're leaving me or not?

51
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,717
No, I can't tell you right now
because I'm paralyzed.

52
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,033
When you were screwing me
an hour ago you weren't paralyzed.

53
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,037
Arturo, we know each other.

54
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,124
You screwed someone
this weekend in Cerler.

55
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:38,844
- Didn't you?
- No.

56
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,637
I mean, that's not important.

57
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,278
- You did!
- Look...

58
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,316
- Bastard!
- I don't know how it happened.

59
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:46,436
I love you.

60
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,078
And I used a condom,
I swear.

61
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:51,516
I'm in the middle of a crisis!
Can't you help me out?

62
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:54,482
You son of a bitch.

63
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:57,119
Are you apologizing
for screwing around

64
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,553
or saying
you want to leave me?

65
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:00,040
I don't know.

66
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:03,878
- Great!
- Where are you going?

67
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:06,634
That's right.

68
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:07,994
Where am I going?

69
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:11,197
You're the one who's going.
So, get moving.

70
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:12,155
What?

71
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,594
Go away.
I don't want to see you.

72
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:17,956
And I want to have dinner here,
because I know what I want.

73
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,240
Scram.

74
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,723
You're going to eat on your own?

75
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,674
Is it OK if I have
the gnocchi first?

76
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:28,602
They're fantastic here.

77
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,675
Go away.

78
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,835
OK, but that's no way to treat me.

79
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,000
Dickhead.

80
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:38,800
That's great! I'm all messed up
and you insult me.

81
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,159
Unbelievable.

82
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,280
Thank you.

83
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:51,959
Enjoy your meal.

84
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:54,963
Do you follow me?
Weigh it up.

85
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:57,844
What's more important?
Knowing how to listen,

86
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:00,395
or knowing how to screw?

87
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,004
- Well...
- Listen?

88
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,558
Wrong!

89
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:06,437
Look, a cat knows how to listen.

90
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,840
And so does a geranium.

91
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:11,679
But do you think humans
have got to where we are

92
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,557
by listening to each other?

93
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,403
No! No!

94
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:19,279
The human species has progressed
by screwing each other.

95
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:23,674
They're laughing.

96
00:06:23,993 --> 00:06:26,963
Listening is overrated
in our society.

97
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:27,915
Yes or no?

98
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:30,036
I think knowing how to listen...

99
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:34,557
No, you start by listening
and you end up losing hope.

100
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:37,795
Why are you so quiet?

101
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:39,154
Don't you like screwing?

102
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:42,197
If you have to screw
so that humanity can progress,

103
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:43,280
you screw!

104
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:45,721
Exactly! Well said!

105
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:48,003
Let's go to the washroom.

106
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:52,084
Don't get lost.

107
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:55,674
Well?

108
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,079
- What?
- What?

109
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,117
They're a bit stupid.

110
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:03,113
A bit? No, they're not a bit stupid,
they're very stupid.

111
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,316
You want to screw
Stephen Hawking?

112
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,840
You told me they were students.

113
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,637
But are they hot or not?

114
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,439
- Yes, they are...
- They're two goddesses.

115
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:16,439
They've come down to earth
to make you and me happy tonight.

116
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,998
Yeah, but I'm still...

117
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:20,321
You're just out of practice.

118
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:23,562
If you go steady for so long
you forget how the deal works.

119
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:24,754
What deal?

120
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:26,114
I'll tell you something.

121
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,284
I think

122
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,721
we'll tell these two that...

123
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,237
and we'll have a two by two.

124
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,443
Shall we order dessert?

125
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,682
We should have dessert at his place.

126
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:52,842
- At my place?
- Sure.

127
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:57,681
Nacho's a professional photographer.

128
00:07:58,513 --> 00:07:59,844
Yes, he is.

129
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,434
He might do a book for you.

130
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,283
That's very interesting.

131
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,521
And he's specialized in

132
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:12,116
artistic portraits,
very delicate stuff.

133
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:20,680
I always try to give
an artistic touch to my photos.

134
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:21,795
A genius.

135
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:22,915
So.

136
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:27,073
Should we go,
or should we stay?

137
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:31,400
- Hello.
- Well!

138
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:32,515
Hello.

139
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:37,083
I was listening to your friends
while you were in the washroom

140
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:39,881
and they just want to screw you.

141
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,199
Well, he'd like to have an orgy
but this one can't stand you.

142
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,361
- They think you're stupid.
- No, no...

143
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:47,884
Really stupid.

144
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:51,315
Anyway, excuse me.

145
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:56,920
Let's go.

146
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,123
Girls, girls!

147
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:02,164
To tell you the truth, I'm glad.

148
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,680
Yes.

149
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:07,402
No, nothing's happened
with Arturo.

150
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,364
At least, nothing serious, that is.

151
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:12,599
It's just...

152
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:16,399
Nothing, he says
that he's in a crisis

153
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,595
and he feels immobilized

154
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,955
and he...

155
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:24,883
The bastard screwed some girl
this weekend.

156
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:26,554
Hello.

157
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:31,682
No, I don't want to see him
or talk to him or anything.

158
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:35,116
All I want now is to feel calm.

159
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,520
I just want to be left in peace.

160
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:41,440
No! All I want is to be alone!

161
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,875
Alone? What for?

162
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:45,359
Alone so I can...

163
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:46,600
be alone.

164
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:48,841
I like Arturo,
you make a good couple

165
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,683
and anyone can slip up.

166
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:54,320
You like him because he's your
brother, and don't defend him!

167
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:57,198
OK, that's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

168
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,396
- About Arturo?
- Yes and no.

169
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:01,402
About couples in crisis.

170
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:04,563
There's an Argentinean guru
who's a real knock out.

171
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,074
You go with him for a week
to some special place,

172
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,038
like Machu Picchu or Tibet,
somewhere,

173
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,474
and he fixes
your relationship problems.

174
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:16,155
- Just like that?
- Not exactly, he charges 20,000.

175
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:19,482
You want me to spend all that
to fix things with Arturo?

176
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:20,834
Something much better.

177
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:24,435
I want you to go along
and write an article.

178
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:28,433
Give me a good reason,
I'm in no mood for trips.

179
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,476
- All right...
- And don't say you're my boss.

180
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,516
That's an excellent reason

181
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:35,000
but I'll give you
an even better one.

182
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,797
No one's ever managed it.

183
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,317
And I have to go with Arturo.

184
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:41,719
Darling,
I'm talking about work.

185
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:43,284
W-O-R-K.

186
00:10:43,473 --> 00:10:45,999
The photographer will act
as your boyfriend.

187
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:46,796
What?

188
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:49,758
Come on, we've done
inside reports before.

189
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,194
You'll pretend to be a couple

190
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:55,363
so you can be with the guru
and do the article.

191
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,964
OK, two questions.

192
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:58,560
First one,

193
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,116
who's the photographer?
Garrido?

194
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:01,996
No, no.

195
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:04,036
Santolalla? Who is it?

196
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,600
All the staff photographers
are busy.

197
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:09,160
He's new, I can't
remember his surname.

198
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,754
Nacho something or other.

199
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:13,796
He's got very good references.

200
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,677
The second question.

201
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:20,360
What exactly do you mean by
pretend to be "a couple"?

202
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:21,600
That's up to you,

203
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:25,479
but Olmo mustn't find out
you're not a couple.

204
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:28,364
Where is this seminar anyway?

205
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:30,317
- In Machu Picchu?
-No.

206
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,241
- The pyramids of Egypt.
- No.

207
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:35,682
- The Atacama desert?
- No.

208
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,400
It's a magical place,
but a little nearer.

209
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:51,275
Excuse me, ma'am,
the Camino de Santiago?

210
00:12:51,793 --> 00:12:52,794
Ma'am!

211
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,037
O Camino de Santiago?

212
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:56,674
Really!

213
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:07,682
No, I still haven't met Pilar,
and I haven't seen Olmo either.

214
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:09,523
I haven't seen anyone here.

215
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:12,155
How am I supposed to recognize him?

216
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:15,158
Yeah, a journalist.

217
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:19,153
I know I'm a journalist
but this place is full of pilgrims.

218
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:20,718
How will I know Olmo?

219
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:23,524
Does he have a cape,
a magic wand or...?

220
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,234
Olmo.

221
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:28,393
Wait, I think I've seen him.
I'll call you later.

222
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:30,597
I]

223
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:31,840
Excuse me.

224
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,036
- Are you Olmo?
- What do you think?

225
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:37,038
Yeah, of course. I'm Nacho,
pleased to meet you.

226
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:39,241
Take a tee shirt
and join the others.

227
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:47,883
No photos, you say.

228
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:52,635
I like to take photos of all
the trips I make, as a memento,

229
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,676
but some other time...

230
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,319
All right, see you later.

231
00:13:57,873 --> 00:13:58,920
Hello.

232
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,193
I'm Nacho, and I'm in a crisis too.

233
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,078
I'M IN A CRISIS

234
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:07,083
In a crisis, he says.
That's a good one.

235
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,361
I'm Antonio, a pleasure.

236
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:14,523
The woman eating a sandwich
is Bea, my wife.

237
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,040
It's not a sandwich,
it's a Galician pastry.

238
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,122
He hasn't got a clue.
Hi, there.

239
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,604
What a woman.

240
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:26,955
Like I say, if we're here
it's because we're really screwed!

241
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,081
What are you laughing about?

242
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:34,520
Nothing in particular.

243
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,434
So where's your girlfriend?

244
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:39,163
She's lost, I guess.

245
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:41,276
Lost...

246
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:46,284
- That's a good one.
- All right, all right!

247
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,283
It's a real pleasure.

248
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,874
You're obviously a nice person.

249
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,197
Shit, Antonio...

250
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,522
- Antonio...
- The compass.

251
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,162
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you. I'm Nacho.

252
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:18,082
Kim, and my wife, Sum.

253
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:20,238
A pleasure.

254
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:25,158
- Are you Chinese, Japanese...?
- Korean. From South Korea.

255
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,883
She says not a pleasure,
didn't want to come to Spain,

256
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:36,077
didn't want to do the Camino
and not in crisis.

257
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:39,402
She say she just sick of me
and want go back to Korea.

258
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:43,444
And very sorry
she doesn't speak Spanish.

259
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,682
Maybe you'll be lucky this week

260
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:49,683
and bit by bit
things will sort themselves out.

261
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:52,439
How can things get sorted out
in six days?

262
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,954
And we're paying a fortune.

263
00:15:55,153 --> 00:16:01,434
Because paying that amount of money
just to walk to Santiago...

264
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:05,844
If we were even going on horseback
along the Mino river.

265
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,274
Bea, don't start, please.

266
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:09,838
Look, there's Olmo.

267
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,239
Good evening.

268
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:14,323
I'd like to introduce
the last member of our group.

269
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,755
Pilar, Nacho's girlfriend.

270
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:20,194
You?

271
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,761
Yes, yes, yes.

272
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,962
It's me, Nacho, your boyfriend.

273
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:26,763
Don't you remember me?

274
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:29,920
I remember you all right.

275
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,394
- They're worse than us.
- Welcome, Pilar.

276
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,843
Haven't you seen each other
for a while?

277
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:35,920
- No.
- Yes.

278
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:39,474
- That is, yes, but no.
- Yes, but no.

279
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:42,643
- Our relationship is complicated.
- Very complicated.

280
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,679
That's why we're here,
to try to solve a few things.

281
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,477
Like everyone, right?

282
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:59,318
No, I can't spend a week
with this...

283
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm sorry, I can't pretend
to be your girlfriend.

284
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:04,759
Neither can I.

285
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:08,116
There's no time to change.
Olmo has met you now.

286
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:12,398
Don't you realize? Look, what's
the problem with you two?

287
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,921
Give me that for a minute.

288
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:17,553
Look, Inma,

289
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:21,519
I really appreciate the chance
to do this article,

290
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:25,320
but Pilar doesn't want
to be with me, nor I with her.

291
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:28,278
And I don't want to be here
doing the lotus posture,

292
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,243
but here I am.

293
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:33,635
What exactly is going on there?

294
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,724
Pilar and I had a little
confrontation in a restaurant

295
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,917
because she's an interfering
smartass.

296
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:43,639
No, I did it to warn two poor girls

297
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,234
that you were two macho shits.
Moron!

298
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:50,643
Did you hear that?
She just called me a moron.

299
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,763
Put this on speaker.

300
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,558
Listen, both of you.

301
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:57,683
Olmo thinks you're a couple.

302
00:17:58,153 --> 00:18:01,282
The magazine has spent 20,000
plus travel costs

303
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:02,804
and I'm about to give birth

304
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:05,394
so I don't give a shit
about your problems.

305
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,483
You're staying there six days

306
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:10,279
and you're going to bring me
a fantastic article.

307
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:13,921
Otherwise, you shouldn't have
accepted the job, OK?

308
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,039
Now, get to work.
Kisses.

309
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,678
But...

310
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:23,434
Well?

311
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:30,682
I'm the writer here,
I'm the one in charge.

312
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:32,682
OK, whatever you say.

313
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,877
At least, we won't have to share
a bed, will we?

314
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,837
No, we're in a crisis.

315
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:40,195
- Separate beds.
- Just as well.

316
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:43,436
- I'll tell you something.
- Go ahead.

317
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:46,204
The others think we're a couple,

318
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,920
but if you dare lay a hand on me,
I'll cut it off.

319
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,834
- What?
- You heard.

320
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:56,640
You should be so lucky,
but you're not my type.

321
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,801
So, get going.

322
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,754
And you...!

323
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:08,683
Just as athletes go to the gym
to exercise their muscles,

324
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:12,355
we have to exercise
our relationship as a couple.

325
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:14,038
How do we do that?

326
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:17,564
It's easy, with little exercises
that help.

327
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:20,233
We'll start with something
very simple.

328
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:21,878
A good night kiss.

329
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:23,559
Kiss who?

330
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:27,004
Our partner.

331
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,322
Bea, if you don't mind,
we'll demonstrate.

332
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:30,555
Me?

333
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,799
Good night, Bea.

334
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,154
Good night, OI...

335
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:45,476
It's important to kiss every day.

336
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,720
With your tongue,

337
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:50,563
even if you don't feel like it.

338
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:59,484
It's very healthy
and strengthens the relationship.

339
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,679
He's giving your wife
a hell of a smooch.

340
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:18,202
OK, OK, I think we've all got
the idea, haven't we?

341
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:21,964
OK, all right...

342
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:25,281
Like that, every night.

343
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,562
Today we're going to Sarria.

344
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:45,797
It's a long walk,
it'll take us all day.

345
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:51,434
But I'd like to introduce a couple
who've joined us at the last minute.

346
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:54,275
They're from Madrid,
José and Fran.

347
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:57,434
Hello, you're welcome!

348
00:20:58,393 --> 00:20:59,474
How are you?

349
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,042
We're the last to arrive,
but here we are.

350
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,078
And we've brought
all our gear with us!

351
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,164
This is

352
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:13,479
my companion, Fran.

353
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,279
He's a bit shy.

354
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:19,124
Say hello to these nice people.
You're not a mute.

355
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,679
Hi, there, folks.

356
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:28,479
We've got a right couple
of faggots here.

357
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:33,315
Well, we're all here.

358
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:40,954
Let's go.

359
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:05,437
Shit, the Camino de Santiago.

360
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,362
What are you doing here?
And with him?

361
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:10,204
- Don't be so rude!
- I'm doing the same as you.

362
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:12,157
No, you're not, I'm working.

363
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:14,515
You're here to score, Nacho.
I know you.

364
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,478
- Right, we know you.
- What's with you?

365
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:20,836
You turn up here with your cousin...
What are you up to?

366
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,274
- Careful, careful.
- Why?

367
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:26,716
Careful, my cousin
is a terrific guy.

368
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:30,316
I had to have a partner,
so I brought Fran.

369
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,595
He needs a bit of a shake-up.

370
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:34,363
- Yes or no?
- Thanks, José.

371
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:37,803
You have to leave,
you'll screw up the article.

372
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:39,119
Are you serious?

373
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:42,840
First of all, this place
is full of girls in crisis.

374
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,997
Secondly, on the Camino
everyone screws like rabbits.

375
00:22:46,193 --> 00:22:46,955
- Yes or no?
- Like rabbits.

376
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:48,314
And thirdly,

377
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:51,162
I've paid my 20,000 euros.

378
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:52,514
What?

379
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:54,757
You paid to do the Camino
with your cousin?

380
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:57,399
- We've paid 20,000 euros?
- Will you shut up!

381
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:01,604
Well, I paid with a check
and the account is a bit...

382
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:04,680
- You'll get us in a mess.
- No way.

383
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:07,956
- Shit, you...
- No, I won't get you in a mess.

384
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,759
What the hell's going on here?

385
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,322
Is this your girlfriend?

386
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,322
I think you know her already.

387
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:17,760
Hell, you're...

388
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:20,240
Yeah, the one
who screwed up the deal.

389
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,355
That's right.

390
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:22,884
What are you doing here?

391
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:26,716
That's what I was wondering.
What are you doing here?

392
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:30,440
- Who's this, your boyfriend?
- Francisco Gutierrez, a pleasure.

393
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,044
I've got a question for you.

394
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:35,999
Which is more important, knowing
how to listen or how to screw?

395
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:37,922
Not with her, Fran.

396
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:40,684
If you'll excuse us,
we're falling behind.

397
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:43,042
The group'll be wondering.

398
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:45,440
See you later.
God bless.

399
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:47,638
Bye, Pilar.

400
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:13,520
Fucking hell.

401
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:17,156
José, are you sure
we'll get laid?

402
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,921
Shut up and keep walking.

403
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:34,715
- What are you writing?
- A diary of the trip.

404
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:36,244
Wow, a diary!

405
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:39,762
Look at him, lying sleeping
like a basset hound.

406
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:44,277
That's how he spends his day,
sleeping and walking.

407
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:47,158
If it's worked for others
there's something to it, right?

408
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,482
Kim, you came from Korea
just to be with Olmo, didn't you?

409
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:53,153
Imagine coming from Korea!

410
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,594
I don't mind,
if it solves problems with Sum.

411
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,754
- What's she saying?
- Sum say Olmo fraud.

412
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:08,955
I agree with Sum.

413
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:12,874
- Then why did you come?
- Because this one insisted.

414
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:15,394
We even mortgaged the taxi
to get the 20,000.

415
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:20,076
Bea, don't bother them with stories
that don't interest them.

416
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:22,316
You got a loan to come here?

417
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:24,675
- If you put it like that...
- Yes, we did.

418
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:26,722
I thought this was
for people with money.

419
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,957
We haven't got money,

420
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:33,517
but we've got three great kids
and we've never gone short.

421
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:37,957
Just like us, darling.
We've never gone short either.

422
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:40,561
- I like Olmo.
- I think he's great.

423
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:44,041
You think everyone's great.
You can be so dumb.

424
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:49,317
Everyone stand up.
I'm going to take your photo.

425
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:50,514
Come on.

426
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,243
Cheese!

427
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:56,077
You have to look hard at them.

428
00:25:57,113 --> 00:25:58,353
What for?

429
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:02,400
Shit, so that they realize
we're looking at them.

430
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,439
Hi, girls.

431
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:10,080
Hi.

432
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,876
Do you come here often?

433
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,113
They're foreign.

434
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,793
- Shall I say something?
- No, leave it to me.

435
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,114
Let's see.

436
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:33,763
Are you leaving?

437
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:35,679
Oh well,...

438
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:41,720
French girls are always in a hurry.

439
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:42,960
Now what?

440
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:46,953
Now, nothing. We know there's
nothing doing with those two.

441
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:49,599
Two less to waste our time on.
Yes or no?

442
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:52,794
Francisco, we have to concentrate.

443
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:57,994
Right!

444
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:00,000
Right!

445
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:09,403
I don't think gyms are really...

446
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,044
I go to the same gym.

447
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:14,203
Yeah, he goes too,
but it's not a gay gym.

448
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:16,441
No, it's a gym for everyone.

449
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:19,955
You hear the words "gym", "sauna"...

450
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:21,678
Right!

451
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:29,364
- Are you OK?
- What a whack!

452
00:27:30,353 --> 00:27:32,242
You should know
the Camino's vocabulary!

453
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:35,204
And you should be careful
about people walking!

454
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:38,363
- We're all pilgrims.
- I shouted "Right" twenty times.

455
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:41,033
You've got a helmet.
The walker comes off worst.

456
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:44,203
- I'm sorry.
- Like hell, I nearly got killed.

457
00:27:44,473 --> 00:27:47,522
- He's a miserable creep.
- Didn't you hear him apologize?

458
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,398
Maybe he's a bit deaf.

459
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:54,364
- Asshole.
- What! What did you say?

460
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:56,237
Did he call you an asshole?

461
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,356
I don't think
it was me in particular.

462
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:01,882
I'll show you,
you little bastard.

463
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:05,834
- You can shove the bike.
- Shit, you come here.

464
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:09,122
That Chinese guy turns me on.

465
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:10,435
Kim?

466
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:13,075
- Yeah, what about it?
- Nothing.

467
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:16,161
Kim! Hit him!

468
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:17,994
Everything OK?

469
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:21,000
Thanks.

470
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:24,323
I think I've hurt my knee.

471
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,393
No, I was talking about the camera.

472
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:30,959
The camera...

473
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:35,162
Fuck it!

474
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:38,396
No, the camera isn't OK.

475
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,802
Let's try to be a bit more careful.

476
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:44,075
We're not here on vacation.

477
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:50,957
Hey, I've still got the little one!

478
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,078
Good night.

479
00:30:59,953 --> 00:31:02,160
Nacho, will you put
some cream on me?

480
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:06,281
Me?

481
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:09,597
- Please.
- All right.

482
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,280
Thanks.

483
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:18,082
My whole body aches.
I can't even move.

484
00:31:20,593 --> 00:31:22,357
"Bisolfer" isn't bad

485
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,761
but "Geobocid" is better

486
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:27,003
and "Saltratos" is even better.

487
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,434
9 out of 10 podologists
recommend it,

488
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:30,595
it's got more
mineral salts...

489
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:33,524
How do you know so much about it?

490
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:35,761
Everyone knows that.

491
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:40,195
Do you want a massage?
I'm very good at massages.

492
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:41,679
- No.
- Come on.

493
00:31:41,873 --> 00:31:43,284
No, don't bother!

494
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,919
It's no bother,
I'm happy to do it.

495
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,434
And we're a team, right?

496
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:50,479
If you say so.

497
00:31:52,153 --> 00:31:54,155
Did you know that in some cultures

498
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:57,596
a foot massage is considered
a sexual act?

499
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:00,677
- Don't talk rubbish.
- It's true.

500
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:01,920
Look,

501
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,634
the whole body is in the feet.

502
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:07,363
The little toe is the head.

503
00:32:08,913 --> 00:32:11,359
The fourth toe is the back.

504
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:14,756
The middle toe is the chest.

505
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:18,644
The index toe is the legs.

506
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,555
And the big toe is...

507
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:28,478
I think that's enough for today.

508
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,600
- Pilar!
- I don't want any more massages!

509
00:32:31,793 --> 00:32:33,079
It's not that.

510
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:34,954
Your shoe...

511
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:37,839
Oh, right.

512
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:47,484
Good night, Pilar.

513
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,523
That's it.
Now we're all united.

514
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:54,636
- I don't understand.
- Don't worry, Kim.

515
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:58,838
There's nothing to understand.
We're tied together.

516
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:01,434
Birds of a feather...

517
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,876
Not "tied",
"united", it's very different.

518
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:07,963
- How long is this for?
- This is a bit tight.

519
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,598
Don't be such a nancy.

520
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:13,118
It's tight, he says.

521
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,958
Really, darling...

522
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:25,037
- No one is forced to do anything.
- But we have to go like this.

523
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,997
You'll see how important it is

524
00:33:27,193 --> 00:33:30,640
to spend 24 hours close to each other.

525
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,757
But we can go the bathroom alone,
can't we?

526
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:37,241
At least for bigger matters, I mean...

527
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,798
You can't separate.

528
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:41,360
- Not at all?
- It's a long walk to Portomarin.

529
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,634
And today,

530
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:44,964
we have new teeshirts.

531
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:46,757
I'M A BIT BETTER

532
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:47,761
That's too long.

533
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:49,318
So, get going.

534
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:52,483
I don't think it's long.

535
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,994
I told you, and he said so.
It's very long.

536
00:33:57,393 --> 00:33:59,475
That's OK now.
What do you think?

537
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:02,163
Right.

538
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:07,404
That's it.

539
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:13,877
- I'm sorry to bother you with this.
- That's OK.

540
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:18,123
My bank called, it seems
there's a problem with your check.

541
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:21,243
I don't usually have problems
with checks.

542
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,276
It seems it bounced.

543
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:25,881
You're kidding, Olmosl

544
00:34:26,793 --> 00:34:29,000
- Did you hear, Fran?
- Yes, I heard.

545
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:30,922
And I had to tell you.

546
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:36,358
Of course, I appreciate that.
Today I'll sort it all out.

547
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:39,955
In the next town, I'll call
my bank and order a transfer.

548
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:43,521
A transfer, or a check
from another account?

549
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,920
- A transfer, thank you.
- That's it settled.

550
00:34:46,113 --> 00:34:49,674
- It's only money.
- These days, the banks...

551
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:54,355
- What about the banks?
- You can't trust them.

552
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:56,238
Move, move.

553
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:01,243
OK, we have to be tied together.

554
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,913
OK, we've paid what we've paid.

555
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:07,595
But sleeping on the ground
is going a bit far.

556
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,956
I love sleeping in the country
in the open air.

557
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:16,796
- It's good to sleep under the stars.
- Yeah, sure, he hasn't got sciatica.

558
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:24,362
There aren't any girls here,
just cows and cowpies.

559
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:27,636
Shut up and get out
the camping stove.

560
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:31,554
I don't believe in this magic stuff
but it's amazing.

561
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:35,121
You only see him from behind,
or back lit or out of focus...

562
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:38,396
It's possible the photographer
isn't very good.

563
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:43,195
Look, I haven't got a photo of Olmo
and you've got nothing to write.

564
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:47,239
- Are there no more?
- Yes, but they haven't come out.

565
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:49,481
There's something about Olmo...

566
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:53,323
- That's personal.
- When did you take these?

567
00:35:53,513 --> 00:35:55,117
They're for the article.

568
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:58,044
Are they private
or are they for the article?

569
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,597
I'm a photographer.

570
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,119
I take photos.

571
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:09,040
I don't think I have to give you
any explanation.

572
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:10,754
That's all I need.

573
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:13,315
- Nacho!
- Pilar!

574
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:16,841
We're going to play
"The best moment in my relationship".

575
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:17,841
Come on!

576
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:20,715
Play what?

577
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:23,680
Do we have to be tied all night?

578
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,157
It's a bit uncomfortable.

579
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:29,439
- I've almost got used to it.
- Get off.

580
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:31,795
José, no one is obliged here.

581
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:34,434
But I think you should
stay tied together.

582
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:38,841
Antonio, when you're ready.

583
00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:43,714
I'm a bit embarrassed
about being the first.

584
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:47,514
Let's see.

585
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:50,956
I can't remember the best moment
in my relationship

586
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:53,679
but I remember one day,
just after Julia was born...

587
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:55,682
Antonio, these people don't know us.

588
00:36:55,873 --> 00:36:58,353
Julia is the youngest,
Juan Vicente is...

589
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:00,760
OK, OK.
Listen to her!

590
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:04,954
Just after she was born
in the hospital,

591
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:08,682
I didn't sleep a wink all night

592
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:13,515
because with Social Security
you have to share a room, right?

593
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:18,640
I got up and I saw Beatriz
sleeping in the hospital bed,

594
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:21,354
in that horrible green gown
they give you,

595
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:25,361
and beside her,

596
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,160
my daughter.

597
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,721
She looked so tiny in the cot.

598
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:32,443
And I thought that

599
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:35,201
I wouldn't change that moment

600
00:37:35,993 --> 00:37:37,233
for anything in the world

601
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:40,320
and I can't really explain it

602
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:43,724
but I started to cry.

603
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:47,757
You started crying in the hospital?

604
00:37:48,273 --> 00:37:50,435
You're such a softie!

605
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:52,233
Stupid, isn't it?

606
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:56,922
You'd have to be stupid!

607
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:00,880
Fuck!

608
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,919
Shit, that's lovely.

609
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:08,323
Nacho, your turn.

610
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,564
I can't think of anything
right now.

611
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,644
Right, as he's in a crisis,
he can't...

612
00:38:16,953 --> 00:38:17,875
Yeah.

613
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:21,516
It's a pity to lose your chance.

614
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,960
No, wait, I've got it.

615
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:25,598
- You do?
- Yes.

616
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:32,003
The best moment in my relationship
was the first time I saw her.

617
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:34,797
I mean, saw you.

618
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:36,879
Was it long ago?

619
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:40,515
- A really long time ago.
- Yes, ages ago...

620
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:44,479
But I remember it
as if it were last week.

621
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:48,678
I was in a restaurant
trying to pick up someone else.

622
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:51,444
She really put me down
and wrecked the plan.

623
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:53,318
I did it on purpose.

624
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,955
Yeah, but I thought,

625
00:38:58,233 --> 00:38:59,644
"Shit, I like her".

626
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:01,079
Who, me?

627
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,599
Yeah, I thought,
"She's a real pain

628
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:07,878
who sticks her nose in,
but I like her."

629
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:09,677
Why did you think that?

630
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,517
That's what I want to know.

631
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:15,719
Maybe because I liked
that you defended some girls

632
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:17,597
you didn't even know

633
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:20,922
or maybe it was chemistry because

634
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,204
that's amazing, right, Olmo?

635
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:27,477
That's what you thought
the first time you saw me?

636
00:39:28,153 --> 00:39:29,962
Yeah, it is.

637
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,924
- He didn't tell me.
- Nor me.

638
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,277
Night, we drank a lot.

639
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,402
Made love in a restaurant washroom.

640
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,713
Then three more times that night.

641
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,802
Also with anal sex.

642
00:39:51,113 --> 00:39:52,956
Then she swallows my semen.

643
00:39:53,313 --> 00:39:54,917
First time Sum swallow my semen.

644
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:59,324
Very significant for me.
Great moment in relationship.

645
00:39:59,993 --> 00:40:02,394
Then never swallow semen again.

646
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:08,473
My best moment
in whole relationship.

647
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:10,914
Very good.

648
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:12,994
Very nice.

649
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:28,804
Hats off to Sum.

650
00:40:58,193 --> 00:40:59,240
Nacho...

651
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:01,074
WEEK?

652
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,920
What you said before about...

653
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:05,520
...you know...

654
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,484
- The first time you saw me...
- What about it?

655
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:10,358
Why did you say it?

656
00:41:10,753 --> 00:41:13,916
I had to say something,
we're supposed to be a couple.

657
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:15,194
Right.

658
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,437
You didn't think I was serious?

659
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,158
No, no way.

660
00:41:19,993 --> 00:41:22,280
- You don't attract me.
- Same here.

661
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:24,759
Not in the slightest.

662
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:27,241
No one could attract me less.

663
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:30,198
- I really mean that.
- So do I.

664
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:39,557
I want you to know
I don't like you at all.

665
00:41:39,753 --> 00:41:41,164
You said that already.

666
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:12,842
- How was last night?
- How many went down?

667
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:17,636
I'm not the kind that goes round
telling secrets about girls.

668
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:21,519
Maybe not now, but we always
told each other everything.

669
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:23,442
Maybe I'm changing on the Camino.

670
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:24,555
-You're what?
-What?

671
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,154
This article
is affecting your mind.

672
00:42:27,353 --> 00:42:29,276
It's a lie,
she isn't your girlfriend.

673
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,795
You're doing this
to write an article.

674
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:35,599
She won't even
remember you tomorrow.

675
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:37,955
That's right,
girls are the pits.

676
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:41,714
Shut up. And for your information
maybe I won't remember her.

677
00:42:41,913 --> 00:42:42,994
- You?
- Me.

678
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,640
If a girl says hello to you,
you fall in love.

679
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,313
This time it'll be different,
I'll ignore her.

680
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:50,639
Yeah, sure.

681
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,404
You'll end up proposing,
like you did the last time.

682
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:56,563
- You're a real bastard...
- It's for your own good.

683
00:42:56,753 --> 00:43:00,314
I've told you already.
It's much better if I screw her.

684
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:02,242
- José, forget me.
- You forget me.

685
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:03,764
Be careful.

686
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:06,354
Skip it, we have to concentrate
on ourselves.

687
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:10,274
I liked you better when
you photographed analgesics.

688
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:13,244
I'M CLOSER

689
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:17,358
Now that you're an important
photographer you're big headed.

690
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:21,043
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

691
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:22,962
Then fucking tell him!

692
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:25,753
- And there's the other thing.
- What's that?

693
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:28,001
Sleeping with other people.

694
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:32,114
- Is Nacho doing that?
- No, not Nacho.

695
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:33,924
So who are you talking about?

696
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:35,594
I'm talking about...

697
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,244
people in general.

698
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,961
And I'm talking about me too.

699
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:43,963
I didn't want to sleep with Nacho.
Don't you realize?

700
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:45,882
Why not, if he's your boyfriend?

701
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:48,679
Yes, but I... no...

702
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:50,637
- No what, Pilar?
- No, I...

703
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:54,204
It's one thing if my boyfriend
sleeps with others,

704
00:43:54,393 --> 00:43:56,680
but I don't want to do it.

705
00:43:56,993 --> 00:43:58,882
- Don't do it.
- But I have already!

706
00:43:59,073 --> 00:44:01,679
- You've done it?
- Yes, and now I'm like him.

707
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:05,480
- Who did you sleep with?
- Someone who isn't my boyfriend.

708
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:08,120
- What's your advice?
- Nothing.

709
00:44:08,553 --> 00:44:09,964
- Nothing?
- No.

710
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,559
Right, you never say anything.

711
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:17,003
For 20,000,
you could manage a few words.

712
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:20,477
Do you help people or not?

713
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:23,722
And I don't mean walking with them,
I mean really helping.

714
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:25,563
What do you want, Pilar?

715
00:44:27,313 --> 00:44:29,884
Me? I want to be happy

716
00:44:30,513 --> 00:44:32,641
and I don't want my boyfriend
sleeping around.

717
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:36,201
Last night I slept with Nacho
and now I feel like shit!

718
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:39,881
Chief Olmo, we are walking
three hours without stopping.

719
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:42,833
- Do we stop or keep walking?
- Yes.

720
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:46,523
- Yes, what?
- We're going to keep walking.

721
00:44:53,953 --> 00:44:55,762
Closer to what?

722
00:44:57,233 --> 00:44:59,076
I guess closer to...

723
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:01,033
Santiago!

724
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:08,004
It must be that, because as far
as solving our problems goes...

725
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:11,919
I think we're advancing.
I notice it.

726
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:13,524
Advancing in what?

727
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:17,001
We haven't advanced in years.

728
00:45:17,193 --> 00:45:19,275
Look at last night.

729
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:21,555
- What happened last night?
- What happened?

730
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,040
"The best moment
in my relationship".

731
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,201
Didn't you like the story I told?

732
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,044
Yes, it was lovely, Antonio.
That's the problem.

733
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:33,557
The Chinese guy talked about
an amazing screw with his wife,

734
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:36,597
and Nacho about the first time
he saw his girlfriend.

735
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:40,400
But having three kids and a family
is more important than that.

736
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:44,120
Exactly, you only see me as the
mother of your kids, not your lover!

737
00:45:44,313 --> 00:45:46,919
I remember perfectly
the first time I saw you.

738
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:49,400
At the Karaoke
in the Plaza Eliptica.

739
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:51,436
When was the last time
we sang together?

740
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:54,682
- I can't remember right now, but...
- No buts, Antonio.

741
00:45:54,873 --> 00:45:57,843
And when was the last time
we really screwed?

742
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,281
I don't mean a quick tumble,

743
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:02,555
I mean really screw,
like we used to.

744
00:46:03,153 --> 00:46:07,681
- What's sex got to do with karaoke?
- A lot, that's what.

745
00:46:07,873 --> 00:46:11,514
We've lost the spark in bed
and out of it too.

746
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,073
And I want more.

747
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:17,356
- What more do you want?
- I want lots more.

748
00:46:17,553 --> 00:46:21,638
- But more of what?
- That's for you to find out.

749
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:25,995
You not have good sex
with your wife?

750
00:46:26,193 --> 00:46:28,799
- Shit, are you always listening?
- Yes.

751
00:46:30,513 --> 00:46:33,596
You think I don't remember
the first song we sang together?

752
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:35,761
I remember perfectly. It was...

753
00:46:37,473 --> 00:46:40,875
I'll leave my land for you
and go far away from here.

754
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:44,242
I'll cross the garden crying
and with your memories

755
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:46,561
I'll go far away from here.

756
00:46:46,993 --> 00:46:51,920
During the day I'll live
thinking of your smile.

757
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:56,960
During the night
the stars will keep me company.

758
00:46:57,153 --> 00:47:01,477
You'll be like a light
that shines upon my path.

759
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:05,803
I'm leaving but I swear
that I'll be back tomorrow.

760
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:06,596
Come on!

761
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:10,957
When I leave,
a kiss and a flower,

762
00:47:11,153 --> 00:47:14,874
an "I love you", a caress
and a goodbye.

763
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:16,199
I love you, Beatriz!

764
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:18,634
I'm traveling light...

765
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:27,915
Be careful,
you might catch an infection!

766
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:31,117
Drinking directly from the river!
What a man!

767
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:33,635
You always play safe.

768
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:37,159
- Water delicious.
- Yes, delicious.

769
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:38,923
I'll give you water.

770
00:47:39,113 --> 00:47:40,399
How are those photos?

771
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:42,558
Fucking...!

772
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:45,634
- Do you see what you did?
- I'm sorry.

773
00:47:46,153 --> 00:47:48,554
Now this one's wrecked too.

774
00:47:48,753 --> 00:47:50,676
Cameras aren't
what they used to be.

775
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,603
This isn't how I work.

776
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:58,115
It's not the way to do things.
I can't work like this.

777
00:47:58,873 --> 00:48:00,523
Yeah, I know that.

778
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:04,754
Things aren't going well with Nacho.

779
00:48:05,073 --> 00:48:08,441
My waters could break at any minute.
What do you think of that?

780
00:48:08,913 --> 00:48:12,963
That's great, Inma,
I'm delighted, but I...

781
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:14,279
I can't take any more.

782
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:15,964
Now what's wrong?

783
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,954
What's wrong is that
last night Nacho and I had a...

784
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:23,597
an encounter
inside the sleeping bag.

785
00:48:23,793 --> 00:48:26,444
- You screwed Nacho?
- A bit.

786
00:48:26,713 --> 00:48:27,680
How was it?

787
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:32,403
Awful, terrible, because I still
feel something for Arturo.

788
00:48:32,593 --> 00:48:36,678
- I can't screw the first man I see.
- It seems you can, dear.

789
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:38,204
It's your fault.

790
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:42,758
If it weren't for the article.
I'd never have slept with Nacho.

791
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:47,358
Get me out of here! I can write
the article with what I've seen.

792
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:51,798
No, you can't, because
the best part is getting to the end

793
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:54,599
and seeing if Olmo solves
the couples' crises.

794
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:04,237
Please, don't do this to me.
I'm begging you, get me out.

795
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:06,356
Don't worry about Arturo.

796
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:09,716
He's called several times
to ask where you are.

797
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,154
Don't say anything to Arturo.

798
00:49:12,353 --> 00:49:15,357
I'll call him when I get back.
I'm dying to see him,

799
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:16,839
but not now.

800
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:18,604
I can't talk to him.

801
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:20,804
No, promise me.

802
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:29,040
Four

803
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,315
- Your turn.
- I can't do as many.

804
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,719
Come on.

805
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:36,759
Four and a half.

806
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:39,684
- It was hardly even four!
- Yeah, right.

807
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:41,716
Perfect stone is convex,

808
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:44,644
create pocket air between
stone and water, bounce more.

809
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:47,120
Shut up and just throw.

810
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,043
- Five, six!
- Shit, the stone was convex.

811
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:53,883
I'm first in the nationals,

812
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:58,044
and the Chinese is in the lead
in the internationals.

813
00:49:58,353 --> 00:49:59,639
What a bitch!

814
00:50:00,073 --> 00:50:01,598
HIDE!!

815
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:05,038
- Give me a stone.
- Here, the record is six skips.

816
00:50:05,673 --> 00:50:06,640
Know what's wrong with girls?

817
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,278
- What?
- They're evil.

818
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:11,363
- Really evil.
- Evil like...

819
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:13,362
- Evil.
- Evil.

820
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,835
Shit! Fucking hell!

821
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,122
It's you again, you bastard!

822
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:25,081
We'd better go,
it's getting late!

823
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,479
We have to go.

824
00:50:27,913 --> 00:50:29,642
Come on, we have to go.

825
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,924
The hostel is beautiful.
I'm so thrilled!

826
00:50:45,113 --> 00:50:47,081
Yes, it's lovely.

827
00:50:48,313 --> 00:50:49,803
Look at how she gets!

828
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:08,880
I want to talk to you.

829
00:51:09,073 --> 00:51:10,518
To me?

830
00:51:12,033 --> 00:51:15,958
I'm delighted, because
I want to talk to you too.

831
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:18,201
I was just saying to Fran,

832
00:51:18,753 --> 00:51:20,994
"I want to talk to Olmos
about money".

833
00:51:21,193 --> 00:51:23,241
That's exactly what he was saying.

834
00:51:23,433 --> 00:51:24,559
- Really?
- Really.

835
00:51:24,753 --> 00:51:28,678
As we were sleeping in the open
I couldn't get to a bank.

836
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:29,874
Of course.

837
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:34,756
You're wondering,
"Why couldn't José phone his bank?"

838
00:51:34,953 --> 00:51:36,796
- I am wondering that.
- You see?

839
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,917
I did call, and you know
what the bank said?

840
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:42,400
I haven't got the slightest idea.

841
00:51:43,073 --> 00:51:47,840
They said that the problem
with the dud check is technical.

842
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:50,559
So it's all been solved.

843
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:54,316
You can take your check
to the bank tomorrow.

844
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:56,755
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

845
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,034
I don't know.

846
00:51:58,233 --> 00:51:59,644
I'll go with you.

847
00:52:01,273 --> 00:52:03,844
No, even better,
Francisco can go with you.

848
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:05,802
Me?

849
00:52:05,993 --> 00:52:07,119
He needn't bother.

850
00:52:07,713 --> 00:52:11,957
But you know if it bounces again
we'll have a problem.

851
00:52:12,193 --> 00:52:14,002
Of course, I know that.

852
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:17,319
Let's rest up,
we're all exhausted.

853
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:20,762
Let's see if we can sleep
in a real bed

854
00:52:20,993 --> 00:52:24,122
because the soles of my feet are raw.

855
00:52:38,193 --> 00:52:41,356
I'M NOT PERFECT

856
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,723
OK, if nobody's going
to say anything, I'll try.

857
00:52:48,993 --> 00:52:54,238
I admit that I'm not perfect,
at times I'm a bit selfish

858
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:58,595
and I don't always
treat you very well.

859
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:01,873
That's it.

860
00:53:04,793 --> 00:53:06,602
Do you approve of that, Fran?

861
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:09,560
I don't think he really means it.

862
00:53:10,113 --> 00:53:10,796
What?

863
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:13,593
I'm sorry, but that's what I think.

864
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:15,283
You always treat me
like you were superior.

865
00:53:15,473 --> 00:53:17,077
- Me?
- Yes, you.

866
00:53:18,313 --> 00:53:21,522
And when you have the chance
to admit it, you still do it,

867
00:53:21,713 --> 00:53:25,604
as if you were above me
and above everyone else.

868
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:28,564
Wait a minute, Francisco.

869
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,323
I've made an effort.

870
00:53:31,513 --> 00:53:35,438
I stood up here and said
a couple of stupid things

871
00:53:36,233 --> 00:53:37,678
but if you don't approve,

872
00:53:37,873 --> 00:53:40,240
we're never going to have
our fucking supper!

873
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:43,915
Sorry.

874
00:53:46,513 --> 00:53:49,596
Are you stupid
or are you a mental retard?

875
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,881
Did you all see that?

876
00:53:53,073 --> 00:53:54,404
That's what he's like.

877
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:57,676
Olmos, this guy is an idiot.

878
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,997
- No insults, please.
- I apologize.

879
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:04,803
I want to try.

880
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:09,800
OK.

881
00:54:10,913 --> 00:54:15,441
I admit that at times
I am a teeny bit bad tempered.

882
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:17,794
Aren't I?

883
00:54:19,273 --> 00:54:22,800
And if I've had a bad day
I'm not very affectionate to you.

884
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:24,435
But you,

885
00:54:24,673 --> 00:54:27,244
you always look like butter
wouldn't melt in your mouth

886
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:29,481
and underneath
he's as bad as his mother.

887
00:54:29,673 --> 00:54:31,118
- Bea...
- All right.

888
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:35,159
I really love you.

889
00:54:35,713 --> 00:54:39,559
And I apologize
for not being perfect.

890
00:54:40,673 --> 00:54:43,995
But you're so dumb
you bring out the worst in me.

891
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:45,201
Bea!

892
00:54:45,393 --> 00:54:46,474
All right.

893
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:50,359
But it doesn't matter,
because I'm apologizing publicly.

894
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:52,160
How's that?

895
00:54:52,353 --> 00:54:54,003
What do you say, Antonio?

896
00:54:59,313 --> 00:55:03,034
Don't get angry
but that doesn't seem

897
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:04,804
like an apology.

898
00:55:04,993 --> 00:55:06,563
At this rate, we'll never eat!

899
00:55:08,073 --> 00:55:10,474
Even if no supper,
Chief Olmo says we can drink.

900
00:55:10,913 --> 00:55:12,199
Pilgrim wine is good.

901
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:13,884
Good, he says.

902
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:16,919
This wine is "Don Simon".

903
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,161
You understand. "Don Si-mon".

904
00:55:19,633 --> 00:55:20,964
He's Chinese.

905
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:23,475
My turn.

906
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:25,084
When you're ready, Nacho.

907
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:30,677
I admit that I'm an idiot.

908
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:35,155
I believed Pilar and I
had something special.

909
00:55:35,353 --> 00:55:38,163
But as I've seen we didn't,
I'm a fucking idiot.

910
00:55:38,353 --> 00:55:39,275
What do you mean?

911
00:55:39,473 --> 00:55:41,043
You know what I mean.

912
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:45,557
If you're so keen to be elsewhere
with other people, why are you here?

913
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:48,161
Where did you get that idea, love?

914
00:55:48,353 --> 00:55:50,003
From where I got it.

915
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:53,515
Why did you tell Inma that
you didn't want to sleep with me,

916
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:56,557
that you regretted everything
and missed I don't know who?

917
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,962
- Were you spying on me?
- Yes, I was.

918
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:03,794
I admit that I'm not perfect
and that I was spying on you.

919
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,483
But that's not what matters.

920
00:56:05,673 --> 00:56:07,755
What matters is you're a liar

921
00:56:08,313 --> 00:56:12,716
and I understand perfectly
why that Arturo dumped you.

922
00:56:12,913 --> 00:56:13,914
- What?
- What?

923
00:56:14,113 --> 00:56:14,955
- What?
- What?

924
00:56:15,153 --> 00:56:15,836
Who is Arturo?

925
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:18,081
- A lot of things separate us.
- A lot.

926
00:56:18,273 --> 00:56:22,676
But the first and main one
is that I'm a professional,

927
00:56:22,873 --> 00:56:24,875
not totally useless like you!

928
00:56:25,953 --> 00:56:28,684
And I don't mean just in bed.

929
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:31,718
You can't even take one lousy photo!

930
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:33,074
What brought that up?

931
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:37,995
She means they won't have
any nice mementos of this trip.

932
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:41,117
You're manipulative,
and a liar,

933
00:56:41,393 --> 00:56:42,394
and frigid.

934
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,799
Yes, frigid, that's why you caused
the scene in the restaurant.

935
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:49,519
You can't bear
to see others having fun.

936
00:56:49,713 --> 00:56:50,919
You've gone too far.

937
00:56:51,113 --> 00:56:54,401
The idea is to see your own defects,
not your partner's.

938
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:56,755
Frigid? Me, frigid?

939
00:56:57,393 --> 00:57:02,479
Yes, I know it for a fact because
we're a couple, like it or not.

940
00:57:02,673 --> 00:57:04,084
-You know what?
- What?

941
00:57:04,273 --> 00:57:05,763
- It's...
- What is it?

942
00:57:05,953 --> 00:57:06,840
What is it?

943
00:57:07,033 --> 00:57:13,040
It's that you're so fast it doesn't
even give me time to get warmed up!

944
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:15,600
And for your information,
I'm multi-orgasmic!

945
00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:16,715
What?

946
00:57:19,673 --> 00:57:20,640
Yes.

947
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:24,474
Multi-orgasmic.

948
00:57:24,713 --> 00:57:26,044
Is good or bad?

949
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:29,042
Fucking terrific.

950
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,439
Were you waiting for me?

951
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:40,120
Yes.

952
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,154
Do you always brush your teeth
with people?

953
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:47,603
No, don't think I do this
with just anybody.

954
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:52,283
Today we'll pay special attention
to the premolars.

955
00:57:52,513 --> 00:57:53,594
Right!

956
00:58:42,273 --> 00:58:43,354
That's it?

957
00:58:58,233 --> 00:58:59,473
And I've brought

958
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:03,954
dental floss

959
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:05,599
with wax.

960
00:59:07,153 --> 00:59:08,439
You're going too fast.

961
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:12,279
What...

962
00:59:13,353 --> 00:59:14,559
What's your name?

963
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:16,874
Laura!

964
00:59:17,113 --> 00:59:18,922
- My father.
- I was looking for you.

965
00:59:19,113 --> 00:59:21,400
- Well, I'm here.
- I see you're here.

966
00:59:21,593 --> 00:59:25,359
- Who's this?
- Hello, I'm José. A pleasure.

967
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:28,363
- Your first time on the Camino?
- Yes, it is.

968
00:59:29,553 --> 00:59:32,318
I'm a great devotee of the apostle.

969
00:59:32,513 --> 00:59:36,120
We're not. We do the Camino
to be in contact with nature.

970
00:59:36,313 --> 00:59:38,361
- That's nice.
- Yes, we love nature.

971
00:59:38,553 --> 00:59:40,601
That's even better. I'm...

972
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:42,079
I'm an ecologist.

973
00:59:42,273 --> 00:59:45,277
I'm a vegetarian too.
I'm quite vegetarian.

974
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:48,124
Laura, we have to go to bed.

975
00:59:48,313 --> 00:59:50,634
Tomorrow it's a long walk
to Monte Do Gozo.

976
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:53,200
Well, I have to go.
See you tomorrow.

977
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:55,276
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow
on the Monte del Gozo.

978
00:59:55,473 --> 00:59:56,884
Monte do Gozo.

979
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,440
Good night.

980
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,803
If she looks back, she likes me.

981
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:04,714
Look back.

982
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:06,680
Look back.

983
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:16,198
What are you doing there?

984
01:00:18,513 --> 01:00:20,800
- Are you drinking?
- No, no.

985
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:23,683
I was looking for you.

986
01:00:23,993 --> 01:00:25,563
You've found me.

987
01:00:25,753 --> 01:00:27,676
I admit I'm not perfect.

988
01:00:28,913 --> 01:00:32,315
I admit I'm very angry
and I didn't think things out.

989
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:33,844
No, I know.

990
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:36,240
I'm not angry because you spied
on me, even though you did,

991
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:37,923
but that's a different matter.

992
01:00:38,113 --> 01:00:40,115
I'm angry with myself because

993
01:00:40,313 --> 01:00:42,281
I don't know what I'm doing

994
01:00:42,593 --> 01:00:43,879
and above all because...

995
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:46,874
because

996
01:00:47,073 --> 01:00:48,723
I liked the other night.

997
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:51,594
You did?

998
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:56,084
I don't get this, Pilar, because...

999
01:00:56,313 --> 01:00:57,883
You liked it?

1000
01:00:58,073 --> 01:01:01,759
- If you did, why are you angry?
- I don't want to like it.

1001
01:01:02,153 --> 01:01:06,761
But you told Inma you were sorry
you'd slept with me

1002
01:01:06,953 --> 01:01:09,559
and you wanted out of here.
Or didn't you say that?

1003
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:13,883
Don't you see? I want to leave
because I liked last night.

1004
01:01:14,073 --> 01:01:18,203
But it's crazy to leave a place
because you like something.

1005
01:01:19,033 --> 01:01:20,319
Wouldn't you do it?

1006
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:21,520
It depends.

1007
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:22,954
It depends on...

1008
01:01:23,153 --> 01:01:25,918
It depends on lots of things.

1009
01:01:26,273 --> 01:01:28,162
So you liked last night?

1010
01:01:30,193 --> 01:01:31,274
A lot.

1011
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,835
Would you like a foot massage?

1012
01:01:39,793 --> 01:01:43,434
We'd stopped at the big toe,
hadn't we?

1013
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,200
I love the big toe.

1014
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:49,999
- You like it?
- I love the big toe.

1015
01:01:50,193 --> 01:01:52,400
- You like the big one?
- Yes, I like it.

1016
01:01:54,033 --> 01:02:00,075
I warn you, I've drunk too much.
I may not be at my best today...

1017
01:02:00,273 --> 01:02:02,241
- Will you shut up?
- I'll shut up.

1018
01:03:18,913 --> 01:03:21,280
I've never showered
with a gay before.

1019
01:03:23,673 --> 01:03:26,153
And I've never showered
with a dickhead before.

1020
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:29,954
Don't get angry,
but Antonio's right.

1021
01:03:30,233 --> 01:03:32,361
Showering with a gay is a bit odd.

1022
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:36,322
Very fucking funny.

1023
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:39,642
But as sir dipped it last night
he's in a good mood.

1024
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:42,359
Shit, you dipped it last night too?

1025
01:03:42,753 --> 01:03:44,084
With the same one?

1026
01:03:45,753 --> 01:03:47,243
I mean, with your girlfriend?

1027
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:50,516
Of course with the same one.
Who else?

1028
01:03:50,713 --> 01:03:52,397
And is she multi-gasmic?

1029
01:03:52,593 --> 01:03:54,277
That's personal.

1030
01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:58,236
With you, not a chance, eh?

1031
01:03:58,433 --> 01:04:02,324
The thing is, Pilar and I are
much better, all thanks to Olmo.

1032
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:05,161
This Olmo is a genius.

1033
01:04:05,713 --> 01:04:08,159
No, don't thank me,
thank the Camino.

1034
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:19,319
What's going on here?

1035
01:04:19,513 --> 01:04:21,322
What's going on here?

1036
01:04:22,113 --> 01:04:23,114
What's going on here?

1037
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:28,598
Hi, everyone.

1038
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,035
I'm Arturo, Pilar's boyfriend.

1039
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:34,363
- This isn't what it seems.
- Then who's Nacho?

1040
01:04:34,553 --> 01:04:36,476
- Yeah, who's Nacho?
- That's me.

1041
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:40,116
I'm Nacho
and I'm Pilar's boyfriend.

1042
01:04:41,113 --> 01:04:43,639
My heroine:
multi-orgasmic with two boyfriends.

1043
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:46,837
Exactly.
That's why we're in a crisis.

1044
01:04:47,153 --> 01:04:49,474
- Have you got two boyfriends?
- Two?

1045
01:04:53,113 --> 01:04:56,959
I'm sorry, Arturo, but yes,
I've got two boyfriends.

1046
01:04:57,153 --> 01:04:59,474
I mean, they're not
boyfriends as such,

1047
01:04:59,673 --> 01:05:03,837
but I'm with Nacho and with you
at the same time.

1048
01:05:04,313 --> 01:05:06,281
I'm really sorry.

1049
01:05:06,673 --> 01:05:10,120
What is all this?
Since when? And why?

1050
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:13,479
It's a very long story,
let's forget it for now.

1051
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:15,675
It's a very long,
very painful story.

1052
01:05:15,873 --> 01:05:19,798
- I'm not talking to you!
- The three of us should talk, alone.

1053
01:05:19,993 --> 01:05:22,041
You knew Pilar was
with both of you?

1054
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:24,644
I knew it,

1055
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:27,604
not quite so directly

1056
01:05:28,153 --> 01:05:29,678
but, yes, I knew.

1057
01:05:29,953 --> 01:05:32,433
- Nacho very liberal man.
- Liberal and cuckolded.

1058
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:35,398
Nacho's right, the three of us
should go and talk.

1059
01:05:35,593 --> 01:05:38,563
I travel 600 kilometers to see you

1060
01:05:38,873 --> 01:05:41,956
in the middle of...
with all these cows and things,

1061
01:05:42,633 --> 01:05:44,158
and you're with someone else!

1062
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:48,638
Pilar, I'm disappointed in you,
very disappointed.

1063
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:50,676
You screwed someone in Cerler!

1064
01:05:50,873 --> 01:05:53,035
Yes, but this is
a very different matter.

1065
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:56,362
Please, let's go somewhere,
the three of us, and talk.

1066
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,601
- Shit, shit!
- It hurts me too.

1067
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:02,081
Don't come near me.
I want to thump someone.

1068
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:05,834
Don't be long, we're leaving
for Monte do Gozo in ten minutes!

1069
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:09,480
Challenge for you, Chief Olmo.
Now is not a couple, is trio.

1070
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,034
Some people have all the luck.

1071
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:18,198
- So you're not with this guy?
- Nacho.

1072
01:06:18,393 --> 01:06:23,524
I told you, we're doing an article
and have to pretend to be a couple.

1073
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,124
Didn't Inma tell you?

1074
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:27,759
She wouldn't even tell me
where you were.

1075
01:06:27,953 --> 01:06:30,718
I took her diary
and saw all about the Camino...

1076
01:06:30,913 --> 01:06:35,396
- You were about to ruin the article.
- You nearly wrecked everything.

1077
01:06:35,593 --> 01:06:38,722
I'm sorry, but the thought
that you were with someone...

1078
01:06:38,913 --> 01:06:41,200
I was dying to see you.

1079
01:06:41,393 --> 01:06:44,875
I don't want to interfere
but hadn't you split up?

1080
01:06:45,073 --> 01:06:49,476
No, what happened was that
I had a crisis, a little one,

1081
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:51,914
but it's all sorted out now.

1082
01:06:52,113 --> 01:06:55,834
Yes, but it so happened
he screwed someone else.

1083
01:06:56,033 --> 01:06:58,718
- Let's not start that, love...
- No, I'm not starting,

1084
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:02,315
but a crisis is one thing,
cheating on your partner is another.

1085
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:03,321
Exactly,

1086
01:07:03,513 --> 01:07:05,436
if things aren't right
with your partner,

1087
01:07:05,633 --> 01:07:08,796
you don't sleep
with the first person you see.

1088
01:07:08,993 --> 01:07:09,915
She wasn't the first.

1089
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:13,356
That third person can think
you haven't got a partner

1090
01:07:13,553 --> 01:07:17,160
and when he finds out you've lied
he feels like shit.

1091
01:07:17,353 --> 01:07:19,321
The girl in Cerler didn't...

1092
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:22,357
I'm not talking
about her precisely.

1093
01:07:22,553 --> 01:07:25,602
- Who are you talking about?
- I'm talking in general.

1094
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:28,603
You have to be a real bastard,
or a number one bitch

1095
01:07:28,793 --> 01:07:30,875
-depending on the case...
- Really!

1096
01:07:31,073 --> 01:07:34,282
To cheat on your partner, and on
someone else by saying you're single.

1097
01:07:34,873 --> 01:07:36,159
I'm lost.

1098
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:40,836
Darling, I promise
this will never happen again.

1099
01:07:41,913 --> 01:07:43,074
Will you forgive me?

1100
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:47,915
Yeah, forgive him, what the hell.
Forgive him.

1101
01:07:48,473 --> 01:07:50,157
I forgive you, Arturo.

1102
01:07:50,793 --> 01:07:53,399
I've had a bad time,
but I forgive you,

1103
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,759
because it's human to make mistakes

1104
01:07:56,993 --> 01:07:59,519
and I'm very sorry I did it too.

1105
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:03,320
You haven't done anything wrong,
you're a saint!

1106
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,356
I wouldn't go that far.

1107
01:08:06,033 --> 01:08:09,515
And now that it's all clear,
you go back to Madrid

1108
01:08:10,473 --> 01:08:12,794
and tomorrow night
I'll catch a plane back.

1109
01:08:12,993 --> 01:08:16,884
No, I'm never separating
from you again, my love.

1110
01:08:17,073 --> 01:08:20,441
I mean it, never again.
I'll finish the Camino with you.

1111
01:08:20,953 --> 01:08:21,920
But...

1112
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:25,516
- You haven't got a backpack or...
- Exactly.

1113
01:08:25,713 --> 01:08:27,636
And there's the article.

1114
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:30,313
What would we say to the others?

1115
01:08:30,793 --> 01:08:33,319
That we're a threesome,
a modern, open couple.

1116
01:08:33,513 --> 01:08:35,163
Yeah, fucking modern.

1117
01:08:36,273 --> 01:08:40,915
And don't worry about the backpack.
I can get by with anything.

1118
01:08:43,393 --> 01:08:46,636
For a minute I think I believed
you were with this guy.

1119
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,756
I mean, you with him...

1120
01:08:48,953 --> 01:08:51,115
What about it?

1121
01:08:51,313 --> 01:08:53,156
Don't get me wrong, but...

1122
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:56,721
The magazine could've found
a better "boyfriend" for you.

1123
01:08:56,913 --> 01:08:59,644
Did they really believe
he was your boyfriend?

1124
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:00,834
They certainly did.

1125
01:09:01,033 --> 01:09:05,004
Pilar, you tell him if they believed it.

1126
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:19,324
OLMO IS LOVE

1127
01:09:21,113 --> 01:09:23,719
ON THE RIGHT ROAD

1128
01:09:27,353 --> 01:09:29,924
Hey, Chinky, Chinky...

1129
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:34,483
Give me the water bottle,
I'm exhausted walking.

1130
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:36,277
My name is Kim, not Chinky,

1131
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:38,794
and you not have tee shirt,
not from group.

1132
01:09:40,273 --> 01:09:42,002
Chinese bastard.

1133
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,957
I still have the camera
on my phone.

1134
01:09:59,393 --> 01:10:03,318
Well, do something, because we're
not going to have any photos.

1135
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:05,877
I am sorry Camino ends.

1136
01:10:06,073 --> 01:10:10,442
I'm sorry too, especially because
it's ending and we haven't...

1137
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:12,078
Have some faith.

1138
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:14,555
How are you and Fran getting on?

1139
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:18,883
You're the only ones who haven't
talked about your problems.

1140
01:10:19,073 --> 01:10:22,839
What a woman, always interfering
in other people's affairs.

1141
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:26,958
- At least I try to...
- No, I don't mind.

1142
01:10:27,713 --> 01:10:29,442
Our problem is that

1143
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:32,722
as we've been together so long...

1144
01:10:32,913 --> 01:10:35,359
We don't screw very often.
Hardly ever.

1145
01:10:35,553 --> 01:10:38,033
- You're not the only ones.
- But you can't be in a hurry.

1146
01:10:38,473 --> 01:10:40,919
Like I say, everything
in it's own time.

1147
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:44,435
But that time never comes
and the Camino's almost over.

1148
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:46,044
I have doubt too.

1149
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:48,555
Which of you is active
and which is passive?

1150
01:10:48,753 --> 01:10:50,118
What do you mean?

1151
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:52,554
Who gives and who receives?

1152
01:10:53,953 --> 01:10:56,763
It's obvious, I'm the one who gives,
and he receives.

1153
01:10:56,953 --> 01:11:00,844
- Really? I'd never have thought it.
- Sometimes it's the reverse.

1154
01:11:01,713 --> 01:11:05,001
No, usually you prefer to receive.

1155
01:11:05,953 --> 01:11:07,114
Skip it...

1156
01:11:15,193 --> 01:11:16,479
What's she saying?

1157
01:11:16,673 --> 01:11:22,237
Look, I've bought a real pilgrim's
cape, with a staff and everything.

1158
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,484
Lovely, isn't it?

1159
01:11:25,993 --> 01:11:28,473
Your boyfriend is
a bit of a dickhead.

1160
01:11:29,473 --> 01:11:31,953
Why judge people by appearances?

1161
01:11:32,153 --> 01:11:34,884
- He looks like Batman.
- Come off it.

1162
01:11:41,713 --> 01:11:44,114
FOLLOW OLMO

1163
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:54,554
Antonio, come on.

1164
01:12:40,113 --> 01:12:41,956
How many kilometers
have we done today?

1165
01:12:42,553 --> 01:12:43,475
A thousand?

1166
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:45,004
The last night on the Camino.

1167
01:12:45,473 --> 01:12:46,554
Come on.

1168
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:53,999
Wait!

1169
01:12:55,073 --> 01:12:57,201
Why all the rush, for christsake?

1170
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:03,514
- We have to talk.
- About what?

1171
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:09,324
With Arturo turning up so suddenly,
I think I owe you an explanation.

1172
01:13:09,713 --> 01:13:12,114
I think you tricked me
and took advantage of me.

1173
01:13:12,313 --> 01:13:14,156
- Took advantage of you?
- Yes.

1174
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:17,914
I thought you'd split up
and I'd drunk a lot last night.

1175
01:13:18,113 --> 01:13:22,482
Don't talk rubbish, and I didn't
exactly say I'd split up.

1176
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:23,913
This is too much.

1177
01:13:24,113 --> 01:13:27,003
Arturo's been my boyfriend
for three years.

1178
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:29,924
I need a bit of time
to think about things.

1179
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:31,842
It's very clear.

1180
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,240
If Arturo ignores you,
you sleep with me.

1181
01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:37,835
But if he turns up
you want nothing to do with me.

1182
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:39,637
- It's not that.
- Yes, it is.

1183
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,801
- No, it's not.
- A “lovers” tiff"?

1184
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:44,641
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

1185
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:49,282
- Tell him what we're talking about.
- No, it's not the moment.

1186
01:13:49,473 --> 01:13:51,237
- It is.
- The moment for what?

1187
01:13:56,113 --> 01:13:58,639
All right, then,
let's finish this.

1188
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:06,081
We all make mistakes

1189
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:09,482
and recently I've been
a bit confused.

1190
01:14:12,433 --> 01:14:13,798
I think I'm in a crisis.

1191
01:14:14,073 --> 01:14:15,404
In a crisis?

1192
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,315
- You screwed this bastard?
- I'm sorry!

1193
01:14:20,513 --> 01:14:23,323
I want you to know now.
I don't know how it happened.

1194
01:14:23,513 --> 01:14:25,675
No, I do know, but I'm sorry.

1195
01:14:25,873 --> 01:14:28,274
Well, not that much.
Forgive me.

1196
01:14:28,753 --> 01:14:30,596
So it's all true, Pilar?

1197
01:14:30,953 --> 01:14:32,034
You slept with this dickhead?

1198
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:33,359
- A little bit.
- Twice.

1199
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,520
- I'll thump you.
- What?

1200
01:14:34,713 --> 01:14:37,557
You can't fix everything
with your fists!

1201
01:14:37,993 --> 01:14:40,599
But you... with this creep.

1202
01:14:40,913 --> 01:14:44,520
He's the kind who goes after girls
when their boyfriends aren't there.

1203
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:48,081
Listen, smartass, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend!

1204
01:14:48,273 --> 01:14:50,401
Will you shut up?
You're only making it worse!

1205
01:14:50,593 --> 01:14:54,120
I won't shut up
because I've got a lot to say.

1206
01:14:54,313 --> 01:14:56,236
I've got a lot to say.

1207
01:14:56,433 --> 01:14:58,640
You're the best thing ever
and I love you.

1208
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,073
What?

1209
01:15:00,393 --> 01:15:01,201
What?

1210
01:15:04,673 --> 01:15:08,120
I love you
and I want you with me.

1211
01:15:09,073 --> 01:15:11,804
I want you to come back to Madrid
with me, not with Arturo.

1212
01:15:12,713 --> 01:15:13,839
I love you.

1213
01:15:15,353 --> 01:15:16,195
But...

1214
01:15:16,393 --> 01:15:19,681
That's it, I'll kill him.
I'm going to flatten you!

1215
01:15:19,873 --> 01:15:21,238
I'll do you in!

1216
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:25,916
That's enough, please!
I said, that's enough!

1217
01:15:26,113 --> 01:15:27,399
Stop it!

1218
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:31,874
You cheated on me, now I've
cheated on you. We're quits.

1219
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:33,837
- But...
- But nothing!

1220
01:15:34,433 --> 01:15:36,959
I'm sick of spending my life
waiting for you.

1221
01:15:37,153 --> 01:15:40,999
"I'm in a crisis, I'm not sure about
us, I screwed someone in Cerler..."

1222
01:15:41,193 --> 01:15:42,080
Exactly.

1223
01:15:42,273 --> 01:15:45,083
That's enough, Arturo.
Why don't you leave me alone?

1224
01:15:46,033 --> 01:15:49,401
You can't spend your whole life
using me.

1225
01:15:51,233 --> 01:15:52,200
And me?

1226
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:54,001
You?

1227
01:15:54,313 --> 01:15:55,121
Nothing.

1228
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:58,516
I slept with you
and I'm sorry I hurt you.

1229
01:15:59,073 --> 01:16:01,758
Right now I can't be with anyone.

1230
01:16:02,873 --> 01:16:04,159
I'm going to eat.

1231
01:16:08,753 --> 01:16:10,039
Watch it!

1232
01:16:15,193 --> 01:16:17,355
When we're alone, you're for it.

1233
01:16:18,433 --> 01:16:22,279
What are you saying?
Forget about me, man.

1234
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:26,238
Fuck you, it's the last one.

1235
01:16:37,433 --> 01:16:38,719
I was telling Kim

1236
01:16:39,153 --> 01:16:42,555
that Sum is looking lovely tonight,
isn't she, Antonio?

1237
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:44,756
Yes, lovely.

1238
01:16:44,953 --> 01:16:46,557
- You lovely too.
- Thank you.

1239
01:16:47,033 --> 01:16:48,956
Here, we're all lovely.

1240
01:16:51,633 --> 01:16:54,318
Sum thinks
you're very handsome too.

1241
01:16:54,513 --> 01:16:57,881
She thinks you're attractive,
a kind of Latin lover.

1242
01:16:58,153 --> 01:16:59,439
How do you know?

1243
01:16:59,633 --> 01:17:00,919
Because

1244
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:03,076
we talked about it earlier,
right, Kim?

1245
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:04,354
Yes, we talked.

1246
01:17:06,553 --> 01:17:08,123
Sum say, "Antonio handsome."

1247
01:17:08,313 --> 01:17:09,883
Thanks a lot.

1248
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:13,524
And we thought,
as this last night on Camino,

1249
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,080
we four could do something special.

1250
01:17:16,273 --> 01:17:17,843
We could swap partners.

1251
01:17:23,113 --> 01:17:24,399
You're joking, right?

1252
01:17:34,993 --> 01:17:38,440
- José, I was looking for you.
- No, not now, Fran.

1253
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:41,955
Yes, now, José. The Camino ends
tomorrow and we haven't scored once.

1254
01:17:42,153 --> 01:17:44,201
What you say is right,
and it isn't.

1255
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,875
Everyone knows you get to Santiago
and then you screw everything.

1256
01:17:48,073 --> 01:17:52,715
No, either we screw tonight
or I'll tell everyone we're not gay.

1257
01:17:53,593 --> 01:17:55,721
Tell everyone whatever you want.

1258
01:17:56,593 --> 01:17:59,278
In the end, it's all the same
to me. I've...

1259
01:17:59,473 --> 01:18:00,713
You've what?

1260
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:03,841
I've found what I was looking for.

1261
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:06,881
I've found something pure,

1262
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,119
something clean.

1263
01:18:09,313 --> 01:18:11,042
What are you talking about?

1264
01:18:12,673 --> 01:18:14,437
On the Camino

1265
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,275
I've found a special person.

1266
01:18:18,473 --> 01:18:20,316
She's someone different,

1267
01:18:21,633 --> 01:18:22,964
marvelous.

1268
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:24,719
There she is.

1269
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,114
There she is.

1270
01:18:26,313 --> 01:18:29,874
- Shit, tell her to find me a friend.
- No, no.

1271
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:32,516
You can't understand this.

1272
01:18:33,713 --> 01:18:34,874
It's totally

1273
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:36,994
platonic.

1274
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:39,759
Platonic.

1275
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:45,837
- Hi.
- How are you?

1276
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:48,764
I got away, my father's
always watching me.

1277
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:53,124
- Have you brushed your teeth?
- Forget that rubbish.

1278
01:18:53,793 --> 01:18:56,683
I'll see you in the barn
at midnight.

1279
01:18:56,873 --> 01:18:57,795
And bring condoms.

1280
01:18:58,153 --> 01:18:59,040
Condoms?

1281
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:00,155
And your boyfriend.

1282
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:02,801
- What?
- Isn't he your boyfriend?

1283
01:19:05,553 --> 01:19:07,635
I've never done it
with a pair of gays

1284
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:09,119
and I'm really curious.

1285
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:12,681
I want to do it with both of you.

1286
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:15,914
Like the idea?

1287
01:19:16,113 --> 01:19:17,524
Yes, no, I guess so.

1288
01:19:25,273 --> 01:19:26,877
So, has she got a friend?

1289
01:19:27,953 --> 01:19:29,876
- We don't need one.
- Why?

1290
01:19:31,993 --> 01:19:33,916
You're going to screw tonight.

1291
01:19:35,033 --> 01:19:37,161
I am? Who with?

1292
01:19:39,913 --> 01:19:42,200
- With me.
- Quit messing.

1293
01:19:43,473 --> 01:19:46,283
We can't take off the blindfold
until dawn?

1294
01:19:46,473 --> 01:19:47,520
Exactly.

1295
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:50,634
You can't take it off
no matter what happens.

1296
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,722
- I don't get it.
- That's the idea.

1297
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,039
But we arranged...

1298
01:19:54,233 --> 01:19:57,919
We arranged to sleep all night,
and now with this blindfold...

1299
01:19:58,113 --> 01:20:02,402
We've been doing exercises
to think about our partner.

1300
01:20:02,593 --> 01:20:06,234
Now we'll try
to not think about anything

1301
01:20:06,793 --> 01:20:09,444
and be carried along
by our instincts.

1302
01:20:10,273 --> 01:20:12,640
I don't want to disagree

1303
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:16,838
but even if we cover our eyes
we can still think.

1304
01:20:17,873 --> 01:20:21,036
Yes, but we'll have to be guided
by what we feel.

1305
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,473
All right.

1306
01:20:22,673 --> 01:20:26,564
It's very important to wear
the blindfold until dawn.

1307
01:20:26,753 --> 01:20:28,198
Very few manage it.

1308
01:20:28,433 --> 01:20:29,480
So what do we do?

1309
01:20:29,673 --> 01:20:32,074
You can each do as you want,
but blindfolded.

1310
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:34,357
It's a case of finding the path.

1311
01:20:34,553 --> 01:20:37,204
- What path?
- The one to solve our problems.

1312
01:20:37,393 --> 01:20:38,394
Each one has his path.

1313
01:20:38,593 --> 01:20:41,563
- What is prize for winner?
- There are no prizes, Kim.

1314
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:45,644
It's a case of looking without
thinking of rewards or anything.

1315
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:48,564
OK, but when does this start?

1316
01:20:50,433 --> 01:20:51,559
It's started already.

1317
01:20:55,593 --> 01:20:59,200
Remember you can't remove
the blindfold until dawn,

1318
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:00,519
no matter what happens.

1319
01:21:00,713 --> 01:21:02,920
We can't take off the blindfolds.

1320
01:21:03,393 --> 01:21:07,955
If we do, we'll have lost
any chance of finding our path.

1321
01:21:51,993 --> 01:21:54,360
José, I think we're lost.

1322
01:21:55,313 --> 01:21:57,600
- If we take off the blindfold...?
- Hang on.

1323
01:22:10,313 --> 01:22:13,795
- Get the hell out of here!
- Sorry, sorry!

1324
01:22:14,713 --> 01:22:17,319
Don't push me, I'll hit you!

1325
01:22:19,153 --> 01:22:23,636
- Sorry, I've got the wrong bed.
- No, you haven't, this is your bed.

1326
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:25,080
Olmo?

1327
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,195
Yes.

1328
01:22:26,633 --> 01:22:29,955
If you don't mind, as it's the last
night, I'd like to sleep here.

1329
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,684
Is this a kind of exercise?

1330
01:22:34,873 --> 01:22:36,363
We could say that.

1331
01:22:37,193 --> 01:22:38,319
Well...

1332
01:22:39,593 --> 01:22:41,482
You two, it's about time.

1333
01:22:41,673 --> 01:22:44,324
- Laura?
- We can't take off the blindfolds.

1334
01:22:44,513 --> 01:22:47,562
Whatever you say,
I love games.

1335
01:22:47,753 --> 01:22:49,835
Let's go inside.
Keep to your right.

1336
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:52,844
Hey, José,

1337
01:22:53,433 --> 01:22:56,357
what if she asks us
to smooch each other?

1338
01:22:56,553 --> 01:22:58,476
If you put a hand on me,

1339
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:01,324
I'll knock you through the wall.

1340
01:23:09,153 --> 01:23:10,803
What is it, Beatriz?

1341
01:23:10,993 --> 01:23:12,233
The Chinese are waiting.

1342
01:23:12,513 --> 01:23:14,993
How can you be sure
if you're blindfolded?

1343
01:23:15,193 --> 01:23:19,118
Maybe it's not them and we'll
be sleeping with God knows who!

1344
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:22,157
Don't talk rubbish.
Anyway, it's what you wanted.

1345
01:23:22,353 --> 01:23:24,162
- What?
- A change.

1346
01:23:24,353 --> 01:23:25,923
This is our chance.

1347
01:23:26,113 --> 01:23:29,640
But I didn't want you
to sleep with a Chinese man!

1348
01:23:30,753 --> 01:23:32,642
I love you.
Now, come on.

1349
01:23:34,553 --> 01:23:35,839
Find your path.

1350
01:23:36,473 --> 01:23:39,636
Find your path,
as if it was so fucking easy!

1351
01:23:40,713 --> 01:23:42,841
You're naked.

1352
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:47,999
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all, no way.

1353
01:23:50,753 --> 01:23:52,039
Saint James,

1354
01:23:52,673 --> 01:23:54,721
this is an odd request,

1355
01:23:54,913 --> 01:23:57,234
especially coming from a guy
who's blindfolded,

1356
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,039
but if the Chinaman
could fire a blank tonight

1357
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:03,316
I promise I'll do the Camino
on my knees next year.

1358
01:24:03,513 --> 01:24:06,403
I've screwed other girls.
Hell, everyone does that.

1359
01:24:06,593 --> 01:24:09,642
But at least they were all
much prettier than her.

1360
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:13,519
Who would cheat on their girlfriend
with someone uglier?

1361
01:24:13,713 --> 01:24:17,001
Nacho's a lot uglier than I am!
Am I right or not?

1362
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,003
I said I loved her.

1363
01:24:20,593 --> 01:24:23,164
I said she was the best thing ever.

1364
01:24:23,353 --> 01:24:25,799
What more do I have to do?

1365
01:24:25,993 --> 01:24:27,995
God, give me a sign!

1366
01:24:28,473 --> 01:24:30,441
Can't you fucking scream
somewhere else?

1367
01:24:31,753 --> 01:24:34,074
It's 2:00 in the morning,
you dickhead!

1368
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:36,797
Sorry, sorry.

1369
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:49,561
I'm coming, Beatriz.

1370
01:24:49,913 --> 01:24:53,076
Come on, Antonio, come on.

1371
01:24:53,593 --> 01:24:56,563
To hell with Blindman's Buff!
They can play.

1372
01:24:56,793 --> 01:24:59,444
They're the ones in a crisis.
I'm fucking great.

1373
01:24:59,633 --> 01:25:00,964
So, move.

1374
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:06,959
Get off!

1375
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:36,923
Go, China!

1376
01:25:41,913 --> 01:25:43,358
Sorry, sorry.

1377
01:25:44,153 --> 01:25:45,803
Is it morning yet?

1378
01:26:19,993 --> 01:26:21,961
- What?
- No, nothing.

1379
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:24,358
You're looking at me.

1380
01:26:28,153 --> 01:26:30,804
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1381
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:36,758
We get to Santiago today.

1382
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:38,883
So it seems.

1383
01:26:53,673 --> 01:26:56,483
- What? What is it?
- Well, it's just that...

1384
01:26:57,993 --> 01:27:00,997
- Not me...
- Skip it, OK.

1385
01:27:02,473 --> 01:27:03,554
I'M A NEW PERSON.

1386
01:27:03,753 --> 01:27:06,757
Well, let's get this finished.

1387
01:27:06,953 --> 01:27:08,876
Which way is Santiago?

1388
01:27:09,073 --> 01:27:13,362
- Apparently it's only five kms.
- And it's all downhill.

1389
01:27:13,553 --> 01:27:14,793
That's great.

1390
01:27:14,993 --> 01:27:17,473
This is a splendid day
to finish the Camino.

1391
01:27:18,873 --> 01:27:20,716
- She told me she had to leave.
- Who?

1392
01:27:21,393 --> 01:27:24,158
Pilar. She told me
to say goodbye to you.

1393
01:27:24,353 --> 01:27:27,323
She left recently. Get off bus
in Santiago and get train.

1394
01:27:27,513 --> 01:27:28,719
- She said nothing else?
- No.

1395
01:27:28,913 --> 01:27:31,200
- Why did she go?
- I guess she's tired.

1396
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,517
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

1397
01:27:33,713 --> 01:27:36,523
Don't try. Do something.

1398
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,921
- And what do I do?
- You shut up.

1399
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:40,882
She didn't even say goodbye to you.

1400
01:27:41,193 --> 01:27:42,922
Give me a break.

1401
01:27:43,113 --> 01:27:44,683
She didn't tell you anything special.

1402
01:27:44,873 --> 01:27:47,114
It was more than she told you.

1403
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:49,598
What bus did she take?

1404
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:53,163
- Those white ones down there.
- Dammit...

1405
01:27:53,673 --> 01:27:56,563
- Where are you going?
- To tell her I love her.

1406
01:27:56,753 --> 01:27:58,039
Again?

1407
01:27:59,393 --> 01:28:00,758
Pilar, wait!

1408
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,680
Pilar, stop! Pilar!

1409
01:28:08,153 --> 01:28:09,837
“Gill

1410
01:28:14,353 --> 01:28:15,718
Get out of my way.

1411
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:27,201
Bastard, I've broken my soul!

1412
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,358
It isn't that serious.

1413
01:28:29,873 --> 01:28:31,762
Stop, Pilar!

1414
01:28:35,553 --> 01:28:36,918
Wait!

1415
01:28:42,033 --> 01:28:43,444
I don't believe it!

1416
01:28:48,753 --> 01:28:50,198
Are you OK?

1417
01:28:53,673 --> 01:28:54,799
Get off!

1418
01:29:01,433 --> 01:29:02,673
Coruna

1419
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,560
Shit!

1420
01:29:14,713 --> 01:29:16,317
- That hurts.
- It'll hurt more.

1421
01:29:16,513 --> 01:29:18,515
- It wasn't me.
- I don't care.

1422
01:29:18,713 --> 01:29:21,034
Gentlemen, please.

1423
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:23,917
We'll take them to the hospital.

1424
01:29:24,113 --> 01:29:25,399
Fine, thank you.

1425
01:29:25,913 --> 01:29:28,723
Let's get going.
The apostle is waiting for us.

1426
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:40,677
- Are you OK?
- No, José, I'm not OK.

1427
01:30:20,593 --> 01:30:22,118
Santiago cathedral.

1428
01:30:23,553 --> 01:30:26,159
Millions of people
come here every year.

1429
01:30:27,393 --> 01:30:30,602
- Now what do we do?
- We go inside, kiss the saint...

1430
01:30:31,433 --> 01:30:33,162
and give thanks for the journey.

1431
01:31:01,313 --> 01:31:02,644
Look, Fran,

1432
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:05,200
you're worried about
what happened last night

1433
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:08,715
and you're probably wondering
about your sexuality.

1434
01:31:08,953 --> 01:31:11,797
- You're very young and...
- I'm not that young.

1435
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:14,320
What I mean is...
You know what I mean.

1436
01:31:14,513 --> 01:31:17,323
The past is the past
and we have to look forward.

1437
01:31:18,913 --> 01:31:20,403
-Jose...
-What?

1438
01:31:21,913 --> 01:31:23,403
Could we do it again?

1439
01:31:23,593 --> 01:31:26,597
Shit, I don't know
if we'll see Laura again.

1440
01:31:26,793 --> 01:31:30,115
- I mean, do it again with you.
- You and me with a girl?

1441
01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:32,919
Or without a girl.

1442
01:31:40,513 --> 01:31:45,155
I was thinking that next year
we could do another trip.

1443
01:31:45,513 --> 01:31:47,561
If we've paid off the mortgage.

1444
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:51,724
Yeah, but no walking or hostels
or stuff like that.

1445
01:31:52,433 --> 01:31:54,037
I'd thought of a cruise.

1446
01:31:54,233 --> 01:31:57,362
- A cruise, just you and me?
- A Mediterranean cruise.

1447
01:31:57,553 --> 01:32:01,035
But it doesn't have to be
just you and me.

1448
01:32:01,233 --> 01:32:02,962
We love Mediterranean.

1449
01:32:04,673 --> 01:32:06,994
Sum say four together
have good time.

1450
01:32:07,193 --> 01:32:08,638
Four on a cruise?

1451
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:11,996
And those ships have got
swimming pools, discos, karaoke...

1452
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:13,843
Karaoke!

1453
01:32:14,033 --> 01:32:16,081
Well, if we have to go,

1454
01:32:16,433 --> 01:32:17,400
we'll go!

1455
01:32:33,553 --> 01:32:35,601
Why are you lying there?

1456
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:37,959
You've come back?

1457
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,237
I didn't go, that's different.

1458
01:32:40,433 --> 01:32:41,559
Why's that?

1459
01:32:42,553 --> 01:32:47,115
I was going to send you this card
but I don't have your address.

1460
01:32:47,313 --> 01:32:48,838
- My address...
- Yes.

1461
01:32:49,033 --> 01:32:50,762
I'm not at home much.

1462
01:32:52,473 --> 01:32:54,919
Then I'll give it to you
personally. Here.

1463
01:32:57,193 --> 01:32:58,558
It's very nice.

1464
01:32:59,593 --> 01:33:01,880
- Aren't you going to say anything?
- No, nothing.

1465
01:33:02,073 --> 01:33:03,563
Not a word.

1466
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:07,723
Why are you lying here
in the middle of the square?

1467
01:33:08,313 --> 01:33:09,758
It's tradition.

1468
01:33:09,953 --> 01:33:12,035
You get the best view
of the cathedral.

1469
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:14,076
- I didn't know that.
- Now you do.

1470
01:33:14,273 --> 01:33:15,638
- All right.
- OK.

1471
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:17,164
Can I kiss you?

1472
01:33:18,753 --> 01:33:21,199
Here, in the square,
I don't know.

1473
01:33:21,913 --> 01:33:23,722
The cathedral, the saint...

1474
01:33:23,913 --> 01:33:25,438
All right, sorry.

1475
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:29,843
You want to kiss me?

1476
01:33:30,913 --> 01:33:31,994
I'll kiss you.

1477
01:33:40,553 --> 01:33:43,159
What you said
about being multi-orgasmic...

1478
01:33:43,353 --> 01:33:44,320
What?

1479
01:33:44,713 --> 01:33:46,363
Were you serious?

1480
01:33:46,873 --> 01:33:51,322
- I'll prove it right now.
- Right now.

1481
01:33:54,473 --> 01:33:56,521
Me too.

1482
01:34:01,193 --> 01:34:04,436
I can't fall in love with you.

1483
01:34:09,033 --> 01:34:12,276
I can't fall in love with you.

1484
01:34:27,313 --> 01:34:29,884
I'll leave my land for you,

1485
01:34:30,393 --> 01:34:34,364
I'll leave my land and go far away

1486
01:34:34,553 --> 01:34:36,521
from here.

1487
01:34:38,713 --> 01:34:41,319
I'll cross the garden crying

1488
01:34:41,513 --> 01:34:45,723
and with your memories
I'll go far away

1489
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:47,961
from here.

1490
01:34:49,153 --> 01:34:51,838
During the day I'll live

1491
01:34:52,033 --> 01:34:54,718
thinking of your smile.

1492
01:34:54,913 --> 01:35:00,238
During the night,
the stars will keep me company.

1493
01:35:00,433 --> 01:35:05,963
You'll be like a light
that shines upon my path.

1494
01:35:06,153 --> 01:35:11,683
I'm leaving but I swear
that I'll be back tomorrow.

1495
01:35:14,753 --> 01:35:19,475
When I leave,
a kiss and a flower...

1496
01:35:21,153 --> 01:35:22,837
There's no money?

1497
01:35:23,313 --> 01:35:24,963
I'm sorry, there's no money.

1498
01:35:26,113 --> 01:35:28,195
How come?
I gave him a dud check.

1499
01:35:28,393 --> 01:35:31,363
How could someone take 20,000
from my other account?

1500
01:35:31,553 --> 01:35:32,475
How?

1501
01:35:32,673 --> 01:35:35,074
You wrote a dud check for 20,000?

1502
01:35:36,673 --> 01:35:38,004
Who are you calling?

1503
01:35:38,553 --> 01:35:41,682
Listen, the problem isn't
that I gave him a dud check.

1504
01:35:41,873 --> 01:35:43,955
It's that someone has taken

1505
01:35:44,153 --> 01:35:46,201
all my savings
from my other account!

1506
01:35:47,713 --> 01:35:49,124
Too much!

1507
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:53,280
...The stones on the path.

1508
01:35:53,473 --> 01:35:59,116
What we love
is always left behind.

1509
01:36:04,793 --> 01:36:07,399
I'll look for a place for you

1510
01:36:07,633 --> 01:36:10,921
where the sky meets the sea,

1511
01:36:12,113 --> 01:36:13,797
far from here.

1512
01:36:16,113 --> 01:36:18,798
With my hands and with your love

1513
01:36:18,993 --> 01:36:22,076
PH manage to End another dream,

1514
01:36:23,513 --> 01:36:25,117
far from here.

1515
01:36:26,593 --> 01:36:28,960
"How to get your partner back
for 20,000."

1516
01:36:29,313 --> 01:36:32,522
A story of true love
on the Camino de Santiago.

1517
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:37,395
During the night,
the stars will keep me company.

1518
01:36:37,713 --> 01:36:43,243
You'll be like a light
that shines upon my path...

1519
01:36:43,553 --> 01:36:45,681
"The man who walks in shadow."

1520
01:36:46,793 --> 01:36:48,477
"Is he a fraud or a genius?"
