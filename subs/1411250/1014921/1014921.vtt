116
00:17:17.723 --> 00:17:20.602
My very first.
I was but a boy.

117
00:17:22.102 --> 00:17:25.072
We dropped from the sky and
did what Necromongers do.

118

Destruction was breathtaking.

119
00:17:33.447 --> 00:17:35.290
But then we met resistance.

120
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:39.412
Ferocious like a
storm of lions.

121
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:45.293
Each one of them killed
over a hundred Necro

122
00:17:46.126 --> 00:17:47.969
before their weapons failed.

123
00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:53.051
And then they killed
another 30 more.

124
00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:55.219
Barehanded.

125
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:00.645
Our firepower and
strength in numbers

126
00:18:00.766 --> 00:18:02.564
eventually won us the day.

127

I can still see him, the last
of those magnificent warriors,

128
00:18:08.399 --> 00:18:10.322

forget those eyes.

01:58:58.609 --> 01:59:00.452
Let me ask you something,

1147
01:59:01.654 --> 01:59:03.452
sweet-like...

1148

men died here, Riddick.</i>

1149
01:59:47.408 --> 01:59:51.333
Not sure how I'm supposed to
overlook that. Next time.

1150
01:59:51.704 --> 01:59:53.706
Yeah. Things would
have been different

1151
01:59:53.831 --> 01:59:56.175
if they weren't trying
to put my head in a box.

1152
01:59:58.878 --> 02:00:00.926
So where to now, Riddick?

1153
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:05.514
You know what? Fuck that.
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

1154
02:00:06.344 --> 02:00:08.346
<i>I'll tell you this, Johns.</i>

1155
02:00:08.721 --> 02:00:11.941
<i>Sooner or later, we all
have to head home.</i>

1156
02:00:12.934 --> 02:00:15.153
<i>Tell Dahl to keep
it warm for me.</i>

1157
02:00:15.937 --> 02:00:17.439
And, Johns,

1158
02:00:18.689 --> 02:00:20.783
you keep a strong spine.

Vaako.

1161
02:01:12.159 --> 02:01:14.582
- You are still alive.
- Tell me where.

1162
02:01:16.747 --> 02:01:18.590
He's no longer among us.

1163
02:01:18.666 --> 02:01:21.670
Tell me, and I'll
kill him first.

1164
02:01:22.253 --> 02:01:23.505
You misunderstand.

1165
02:01:24.046 --> 02:01:26.595
Vaako is a decent man who
meant to honor his word.

1166
02:01:27.592 --> 02:01:29.515
Even with you, strangely.

1167
02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.433
I don't care about Furya.

1168
02:01:31.512 --> 02:01:34.106
I don't care what the pact
was between you and him.

1169
02:01:34.181 --> 02:01:36.479
This faith cannot
have a misbeliever

1170
02:01:36.559 --> 02:01:38.027
or a kind heart leading it,

1171
02:01:38.102 --> 02:01:41.151
and I have done what I have
done to ensure... <font color="#D900D9">(GROANING)</font>

1173
02:01:51.115 --> 02:01:52.708
Too many words.

1174
02:02:07.715 --> 02:02:10.059
Never lie to me,
I'll never hurt you.

1175
02:02:13.763 --> 02:02:15.185
One word answer.

1176
02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:19.068
Is Vaako alive or dead?

1177
02:02:24.607 --> 02:02:25.608
Both.
