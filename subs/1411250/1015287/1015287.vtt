1
00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:03.760
I only know I must hold on...
it's vital

2
00:00:03.963 --> 00:00:06.477
I must hold on!

4
00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:18.160
Life is made up of pieces
that don't fit

5
00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:35.522
I want all of Claude, or nothing

6
00:01:36.603 --> 00:01:40.118
if it's no... let it be like death

7
00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:50.279
it's Muriel's answer

8
00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.879
read it... I want your opinion

9
00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:58.397
"dear Claude,
I'm glad you wrote me...

10
00:02:58.603 --> 00:03:02.039
"thus ending a misunderstanding
and a false situation

11
00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:05.555
"it's best to renounce
the marriage immediately

12
00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.836
"Anne and I will always be
your friends

13
00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:10.556
"the garden is superb

14
00:03:10.763 --> 00:03:14.756
"we're going to London
to see the new plays

15
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:17.995
"regards from my mother.
Your sister, Muriel"

16
00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:20.882
an excellent letter

17
00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:23.392
I knew she was a sensible girl

18
00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:25.754
are you reassured? Happy?

19
00:03:26.843 --> 00:03:28.322
You're not happy?

20
00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:29.632
Yes...

21
00:03:32.123 --> 00:03:33.920
you took this on deposit?

22
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.356
The two of them

23
00:03:36.603 --> 00:03:39.561
but this one's going back
to the gallery

24
00:03:57.963 --> 00:03:58.998
time passed...

25
00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:01.353
Claude had not become
an author...

26
00:04:01.563 --> 00:04:04.441
but he wrote articles about art

27
00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:06.913
his mother condoned his affairs...

28
00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:10.115
many women were less
threatening than one

29
00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:11.996
he forgot his "sisters"

30
00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.117
in Wales, Muriel slowly recovered

31
00:04:15.323 --> 00:04:17.439
at times she went to bed saying...

32
00:04:17.643 --> 00:04:20.032
"today I didn't think about Claude"

33
00:04:47.323 --> 00:04:49.632
did you know Anne brown
was in Paris?

34
00:04:50.163 --> 00:04:51.915
Her mother wrote me

35
00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:54.235
you didn't tell me

36
00:04:54.603 --> 00:04:56.719
it was part of our agreement

37
00:04:56.923 --> 00:04:58.561
but it's Anne... not Muriel

38
00:04:58.763 --> 00:05:00.355
it's the same thing

39
00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:02.038
I'll write her a note

40
00:05:02.243 --> 00:05:04.757
instead of writing,
go talk to her

41
00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:06.722
what about you?

42
00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.483
I'll go exchange these books

43
00:05:09.683 --> 00:05:11.355
I'll see you tomorrow

44
00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:13.152
you're not angry?

45
00:05:13.363 --> 00:05:14.921
No, I'm not

46
00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:16.478
till tomorrow

47
00:05:24.203 --> 00:05:25.761
been back in Paris long?

48
00:05:25.963 --> 00:05:27.078
Since January

49
00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:29.114
that's when I arrived!

50
00:05:31.483 --> 00:05:33.394
How about me? Have I changed?

51
00:05:34.043 --> 00:05:36.921
You seem serious,
but you look fine

52
00:05:42.123 --> 00:05:44.398
don't you want news of someone?

53
00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:47.478
Yes... how is she?

54
00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:50.993
She's been sick... her eyes

55
00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:56.319
but she's suffered more
from other things

56
00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.442
I understand

57
00:05:58.723 --> 00:05:59.872
and now?

58
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:02.756
She's better.
She works with children

59
00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:05.158
she teaches Sunday school

60
00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:09.432
actually, I can't tell you
much about her

61
00:06:10.523 --> 00:06:13.435
she no longer confides in me
and I'm sorry

62
00:06:21.403 --> 00:06:24.440
two words are never spoken
in our house...

63
00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:28.191
the words "Claude" and "Paris"

64
00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:31.919
Anne was becoming a sculptress

65
00:06:32.123 --> 00:06:33.761
she had a studio in Paris

66
00:06:33.963 --> 00:06:37.319
she now felt sure
Muriel and Claude...

67
00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:40.515
would never get together.
Yet they'd come so close

68
00:06:40.723 --> 00:06:42.679
no longer in Muriel's shadow...

69
00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:46.114
Anne was the girl
that he'd first met

70
00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:49.360
she was there for herself
and he liked that

71
00:06:49.763 --> 00:06:51.242
they often went to look...

72
00:06:51.563 --> 00:06:55.158
at Rodin's "Balzac",
done on commission...

73
00:06:55.363 --> 00:06:57.638
then indignantly refused

74
00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:00.637
Claude often went to Anne's studio

75
00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:02.715
he encouraged her...

76
00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.436
gave her confidence in her work

77
00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:12.041
Claude found Anne especially
pretty today...

78
00:07:14.923 --> 00:07:17.517
he sensed her heart beating like his

79
00:07:17.963 --> 00:07:20.477
Muriel was no longer a barrier

80
00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:29.833
he had a mad idea:
Caress her breast

81
00:07:30.043 --> 00:07:31.556
why not try?

82
00:07:39.283 --> 00:07:42.275
Would she be shocked,
or slap him?

83
00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:24.394
No, Claude, wait...

84
00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:25.918
listen to me

85
00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:29.001
she moved away from him
to explain...

86
00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:32.916
someone had always
overshadowed her...

87
00:08:33.123 --> 00:08:35.842
dazzled her, silenced her.
It was Muriel

88
00:08:36.043 --> 00:08:38.273
Anne had introduced Claude
to Muriel...

89
00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:41.236
for pleasure,
to see them match wits

90
00:08:41.483 --> 00:08:44.077
picturing them married,
she'd stepped aside

91
00:08:44.283 --> 00:08:46.353
virtuous? No... realistic

92
00:08:46.563 --> 00:08:48.394
were you jealous of her?

93
00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.039
Sometimes... but not for long

94
00:08:51.603 --> 00:08:53.912
when you played tennis together...

95
00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:55.795
you were a real couple

96
00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:57.356
and we failed

97
00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:28.159
no man had touched Anne...
she'd be his

98
00:09:28.363 --> 00:09:31.514
he'd be the first...
but not here, not in Paris

99
00:09:31.883 --> 00:09:32.838
they'd go away

100
00:09:33.043 --> 00:09:36.194
Claude borrowed an island cabin
on a Swiss lake

101
00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:39.993
they'd go there for a week.
They'd try... draw closer

102
00:09:40.203 --> 00:09:42.558
they were more resolute
than in love

103
00:11:03.723 --> 00:11:05.873
tomorrow we must buy matches

104
00:11:07.603 --> 00:11:09.673
a hot meal would be nice

105
00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:12.558
wait... just for a moment

106
00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.198
the 1st night, Anne pulled away

107
00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:33.633
she put up a blanket as a curtain

108
00:11:33.843 --> 00:11:36.403
Claude was to undress
on his own side

109
00:11:36.603 --> 00:11:38.559
the island is pretty, isn't it?

110
00:11:38.963 --> 00:11:41.431
I'm sure the old lady would sell it

111
00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:43.794
I wonder how much she'd want

112
00:11:46.643 --> 00:11:48.076
are you in bed?

113
00:11:48.603 --> 00:11:49.956
May I come?

114
00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:52.562
You're not answering

115
00:11:53.363 --> 00:11:54.557
are you asleep?

116
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.355
It's very nice

117
00:12:47.603 --> 00:12:49.036
tell me, Anne...

118
00:12:49.363 --> 00:12:52.241
haven't you ever wanted a man?

119
00:12:54.043 --> 00:12:56.762
There was one last summer...
much too handsome

120
00:12:57.203 --> 00:12:59.273
his face was too symmetrical

121
00:12:59.883 --> 00:13:01.441
I dreamed about him

122
00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:04.079
I dreamed he kissed me there

123
00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:06.035
I knew it, I was sure!

124
00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:09.152
You have great curiosity
about men...

125
00:13:09.363 --> 00:13:11.433
almost a divine curiosity

126
00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:14.877
it will lead you
to have many lovers

127
00:13:15.883 --> 00:13:16.998
think so?

128
00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.162
I don't know

129
00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:22.512
I only care about my work

130
00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:25.592
I'll make statues, not babies

131
00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:32.803
the 2nd night: More kisses

132
00:13:33.003 --> 00:13:36.040
is the word "copain"
vulgar in french?

133
00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:39.036
No, just colloquial

134
00:13:39.243 --> 00:13:42.474
it means "friend"...
but warmer and more intimate

135
00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:44.998
I'm your "copain" then?

136
00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:49.438
Sometimes,
but we're more than that

137
00:13:57.723 --> 00:14:01.682
"copains" don't kiss on the lips
with hearts racing

138
00:14:15.403 --> 00:14:18.281
I'm tired of being a virgin,
but I'm afraid

139
00:14:19.563 --> 00:14:20.598
afraid?

140
00:14:22.723 --> 00:14:24.873
If you're afraid, we'll wait

141
00:14:26.123 --> 00:14:27.920
you're not angry?

142
00:14:30.763 --> 00:14:32.719
I'm glad we have time

143
00:14:48.563 --> 00:14:49.757
nothing to say?

144
00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.275
I'm listening to you...

145
00:14:53.603 --> 00:14:55.036
watching you

146
00:14:57.843 --> 00:14:59.595
I'm glad you're here

147
00:15:13.123 --> 00:15:15.239
the 3rd night,
Anne seemed very busy

148
00:15:15.443 --> 00:15:17.513
what are you doing?

149
00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.362
I've decided

150
00:15:21.523 --> 00:15:23.354
no curtain tonight

151
00:15:27.923 --> 00:15:29.151
no blouse

152
00:15:35.923 --> 00:15:37.072
no skirt

153
00:15:39.243 --> 00:15:40.835
Anne... what is that?

154
00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:45.839
Her underclothes were impossible.
Fashioned with a knife...

155
00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:48.079
red flannel, military-looking

156
00:15:48.283 --> 00:15:51.832
she removed them simply
and came to him nude

157
00:16:20.243 --> 00:16:21.596
now, Claude

158
00:16:22.403 --> 00:16:23.882
I'm ready now

159
00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:25.793
are you sure?

160
00:16:26.003 --> 00:16:27.231
I'm sure

161
00:16:27.763 --> 00:16:29.196
not afraid any more?

162
00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:05.242
It had to be...

163
00:17:06.683 --> 00:17:08.116
I'm happy

164
00:17:08.803 --> 00:17:11.033
because you wanted to...

165
00:17:12.203 --> 00:17:14.478
but it's not yet... us

166
00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:20.874
it was as if you were alone

167
00:17:31.043 --> 00:17:33.637
the week ended.
Claude wanted to stay on

168
00:17:33.843 --> 00:17:36.801
Anne refused saying:
"Now I see life differently"

169
00:17:37.043 --> 00:17:40.433
"I can learn the rest alone
but I've only you, for love"

170
00:17:52.883 --> 00:17:56.159
she was going home to England,
Claude to Paris, alone

171
00:17:56.363 --> 00:17:58.797
Anne gave him one last nod
of farewell

172
00:17:59.003 --> 00:18:00.994
they were free and it was good

173
00:18:22.323 --> 00:18:23.836
monsieur Claude, your mail

174
00:18:24.043 --> 00:18:25.112
thank you...

175
00:18:25.323 --> 00:18:26.722
are you staying here now?

176
00:18:26.923 --> 00:18:28.276
For a while

177
00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:45.599
dear Claude,
I came home yesterday

178
00:18:45.803 --> 00:18:48.397
this is some wallpaper
from our room

179
00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:50.475
mother and Muriel are in bed

180
00:18:50.723 --> 00:18:51.951
I cried

181
00:18:52.203 --> 00:18:54.273
you're more real than my sculpture

182
00:18:54.803 --> 00:18:56.555
I felt you kissing me yesterday...

183
00:18:56.883 --> 00:18:58.475
Wednesday afternoon at 4

184
00:18:58.683 --> 00:19:00.401
were you thinking of me then?

185
00:19:01.043 --> 00:19:04.752
When I look in the mirror
I wish I'd given you more

186
00:19:04.963 --> 00:19:07.523
Muriel knows I see you, that's all

187
00:19:08.003 --> 00:19:10.961
I know you have other women
but I'm not jealous

188
00:19:15.043 --> 00:19:17.193
3 months later,
Anne was back in Paris

189
00:19:17.403 --> 00:19:20.395
on the stairs
he already wanted her profoundly

190
00:19:37.363 --> 00:19:40.594
she'd changed... the "half-tomboy"
aspect was gone

191
00:19:40.803 --> 00:19:42.361
she was a woman...

192
00:19:42.563 --> 00:19:44.076
have you had breakfast?

193
00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.638
No, I thought
I'd have it with you

194
00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:48.800
but I've nothing here

195
00:19:49.003 --> 00:19:51.471
their eyes met...
hers were now daring

196
00:19:52.323 --> 00:19:54.996
their love-making was new
for them both

197
00:19:55.203 --> 00:19:58.001
Anne now knew
how to use her body

198
00:19:58.643 --> 00:20:00.076
how strange!

199
00:20:02.043 --> 00:20:02.953
What?

200
00:20:03.523 --> 00:20:05.195
To love someone so much

201
00:20:05.603 --> 00:20:09.278
he realized it was 3 years ago
that he had first desired her

202
00:20:12.163 --> 00:20:13.881
you're my breakfast

203
00:21:17.323 --> 00:21:20.042
Claude... I'm too happy

204
00:21:21.403 --> 00:21:23.200
I should have other lovers

205
00:21:23.403 --> 00:21:25.598
I'll let you do the same

206
00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:30.320
love me as much as you can

207
00:21:51.803 --> 00:21:55.239
happiness can't be told,
but it wears down... unnoticed

208
00:21:55.563 --> 00:21:58.396
in public,
Claude rediscovered Anne

209
00:21:58.603 --> 00:22:00.958
she dressed better... smarter

210
00:22:01.163 --> 00:22:04.394
they'd just made love,
yet she looked so virginal

211
00:22:15.963 --> 00:22:18.523
Anne accepted Claude's ideas
on free love

212
00:22:18.723 --> 00:22:21.601
he could have other affairs,
but she refused...

213
00:22:21.803 --> 00:22:23.839
rejecting all offers

214
00:22:36.123 --> 00:22:39.320
Diurka, a brawny Slav, spotted Anne.
He published...

215
00:22:39.523 --> 00:22:41.832
art books.
Handsome in a way...

216
00:22:42.083 --> 00:22:44.722
he had youthful eyes.
He liked her, he wanted her

217
00:22:48.443 --> 00:22:49.273
Claude thought...

218
00:22:49.483 --> 00:22:51.394
"if she likes him... she's free"

219
00:22:53.803 --> 00:22:56.601
Claude saw what Anne meant
when she'd said...

220
00:22:56.803 --> 00:22:59.192
"I'm always a success just after..."

221
00:23:29.963 --> 00:23:32.113
Claude let the day go by,
the night...

222
00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:33.722
next morning...

223
00:24:04.803 --> 00:24:07.271
Claude, I must talk to you

224
00:24:08.723 --> 00:24:10.634
come with me...

225
00:24:18.203 --> 00:24:19.397
I'm listening

226
00:24:19.603 --> 00:24:20.752
you already know

227
00:24:20.963 --> 00:24:21.873
Diurka

228
00:24:22.603 --> 00:24:24.559
he was here... when I knocked

229
00:24:27.403 --> 00:24:28.597
do you love him?

230
00:24:28.803 --> 00:24:30.077
I don't know yet

231
00:24:30.283 --> 00:24:32.160
does he love you?

232
00:24:33.923 --> 00:24:37.233
He came to see me.
He looked at my work...

233
00:24:38.203 --> 00:24:40.273
made perceptive comments

234
00:24:40.723 --> 00:24:42.315
he didn't leave

235
00:24:42.603 --> 00:24:44.639
since this morning, we...

236
00:24:47.923 --> 00:24:49.436
does it bother you?

237
00:24:50.203 --> 00:24:51.477
Are you hurt?

238
00:24:54.803 --> 00:24:56.236
I thought you...

239
00:24:56.443 --> 00:24:58.479
true, but it's still a shock

240
00:24:59.483 --> 00:25:02.077
anyway, I approve...
you're right

241
00:25:03.923 --> 00:25:06.960
Diurka says
he's been alone for a year

242
00:25:07.203 --> 00:25:09.319
I didn't want to,
I don't love him yet

243
00:25:09.523 --> 00:25:10.558
then he wanted to...

244
00:25:10.763 --> 00:25:13.118
Diurka's a fine person...

245
00:25:13.963 --> 00:25:15.999
you think so, too?

246
00:25:18.843 --> 00:25:21.880
He wants to take me to Persia
with him

247
00:25:23.083 --> 00:25:24.641
I think I'll say No

248
00:25:26.563 --> 00:25:27.916
Persia is magnificent

249
00:25:28.123 --> 00:25:30.478
Anne, only your desires matter

250
00:25:31.203 --> 00:25:33.512
you just met Diurka, go with him

251
00:25:34.043 --> 00:25:36.432
I think you two need time alone

252
00:25:36.643 --> 00:25:38.554
I shouldn't see you...

253
00:25:39.603 --> 00:25:41.002
yes, you should!

254
00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:53.517
So Anne had two regular lovers

255
00:25:53.723 --> 00:25:56.442
they both knew,
Anne didn't hide it

256
00:25:56.643 --> 00:25:59.203
the lovers suffered...
Anne thrived

257
00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:08.155
before Persia,
their farewell lasted all night

258
00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:17.961
dear Claude, you'd love Persia...

259
00:26:18.883 --> 00:26:20.441
you were my life

260
00:26:20.923 --> 00:26:24.598
I only missed you in one way,
I won't say which

261
00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.755
your letter said...

262
00:26:26.963 --> 00:26:29.193
"don't be afraid to love."
I obeyed

263
00:26:29.403 --> 00:26:33.635
my uncle used to tell my aunt not to
fear being seasick... she often was

264
00:26:34.483 --> 00:26:36.235
I'm home with Muriel

265
00:26:36.443 --> 00:26:39.037
I'll be in Paris in 3 months...
Anne

266
00:28:12.203 --> 00:28:14.319
Claude recognized Muriel's writing

267
00:28:14.523 --> 00:28:17.276
he was afraid
she'd returned his letter

268
00:28:17.483 --> 00:28:20.122
instead it was part of her diary...

269
00:28:20.323 --> 00:28:22.678
probably
the most intimate confession...

270
00:28:22.883 --> 00:28:24.680
that he would ever read

271
00:28:29.283 --> 00:28:31.717
dear Claude,
we'll never meet again...

272
00:28:31.923 --> 00:28:33.561
and surely that's best

273
00:28:33.763 --> 00:28:35.640
but you mustn't believe I'm pure

274
00:28:35.843 --> 00:28:38.403
I've something terrible to tell you

275
00:28:38.603 --> 00:28:42.312
read my confession...
you'll see that we're even

276
00:28:43.963 --> 00:28:45.681
I've learned from a leaflet...

277
00:28:45.883 --> 00:28:48.716
that since childhood
I've had "nasty habits"

278
00:28:48.923 --> 00:28:52.233
I've weakened my body and brain.
I've abused myself

279
00:28:52.603 --> 00:28:56.437
now I know that I'm no longer
a pure woman

280
00:28:56.723 --> 00:28:58.998
it's my duty to confess this to you

281
00:28:59.203 --> 00:29:02.115
no shame will stop me,
I am what I am

282
00:29:02.363 --> 00:29:05.912
if you thought of me as unsullied,
you were wrong

283
00:29:06.923 --> 00:29:08.720
I was eight. A girl, Clarisse...

284
00:29:09.003 --> 00:29:10.994
was first in class. I was second

285
00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:15.317
she looked like a mischievous angel.
I was told to be like her

286
00:29:16.043 --> 00:29:18.955
her family spent a week with us

287
00:29:20.243 --> 00:29:21.881
Clarisse slept with me...

288
00:29:22.083 --> 00:29:24.074
in place of Anne, who was away

289
00:29:24.283 --> 00:29:26.035
in bed, she stripped...

290
00:29:26.283 --> 00:29:28.513
and said I should, too

291
00:29:29.643 --> 00:29:31.520
then she embraced me

292
00:29:32.203 --> 00:29:34.159
I was devoted to her

293
00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.593
two little girls
caressed all night...

294
00:29:36.803 --> 00:29:38.555
one knowing, one docile

295
00:29:39.203 --> 00:29:42.559
she taught me to touch
certain parts of my body...

296
00:29:42.883 --> 00:29:45.238
one especially.
She convinced me...

297
00:29:45.523 --> 00:29:47.957
not to talk about our secret

298
00:29:48.523 --> 00:29:51.356
after she left
I sometimes did it alone

299
00:29:52.163 --> 00:29:54.597
I didn't understand that part of me

300
00:29:54.803 --> 00:29:58.000
I only knew it was private
and mustn't be seen

301
00:29:58.203 --> 00:30:00.239
it wasn't to be mentioned

302
00:30:00.963 --> 00:30:04.035
the habit would leave me alone...
then come back

303
00:30:04.323 --> 00:30:07.440
I'd give into it... angry...
unable to stop

304
00:30:07.923 --> 00:30:10.357
one sultry Sunday
when I was 17...

305
00:30:10.563 --> 00:30:14.112
I was lying in a field
gazing at the sky

306
00:30:14.523 --> 00:30:15.319
I gave in again...

307
00:30:15.563 --> 00:30:17.394
driven by an unknown force

308
00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:19.480
sometimes I thought of it...

309
00:30:19.683 --> 00:30:22.914
as a way to get to sleep
and to warm my cold feet

310
00:30:23.123 --> 00:30:25.512
but I hated being a slave to it

311
00:30:26.283 --> 00:30:28.433
I fought it, twisting my hands...

312
00:30:28.643 --> 00:30:30.952
face buried, pleading with god

313
00:30:31.283 --> 00:30:33.239
if I couldn't go to sleep...

314
00:30:33.443 --> 00:30:35.115
or think of something else...

315
00:30:35.323 --> 00:30:38.395
I gave in,
then forbade myself to pray

316
00:30:39.283 --> 00:30:41.843
here's a copy of a letter
from America

317
00:30:42.563 --> 00:30:44.042
it has helped me

318
00:30:44.523 --> 00:30:45.842
"my dear young friend...

319
00:30:46.043 --> 00:30:48.352
"your appeal aroused my sympathy

320
00:30:48.563 --> 00:30:52.033
"understand your plight
and feel no repugnance

321
00:30:52.243 --> 00:30:54.711
"I admire your frankness

322
00:30:55.643 --> 00:30:57.838
"if you give way, tell yourself...

323
00:30:58.043 --> 00:30:59.715
"that it wasn't you

324
00:30:59.923 --> 00:31:01.436
"you despise this act

325
00:31:01.643 --> 00:31:03.793
"then jump out of bed...

326
00:31:04.003 --> 00:31:06.039
"and take a cold bath

327
00:31:06.243 --> 00:31:08.882
"don't waste time in self-reproach

328
00:31:09.083 --> 00:31:11.802
"lead an active life, help others

329
00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:17.157
"you learned this habit
despite yourself. It will cease

330
00:31:17.563 --> 00:31:18.393
"best wishes..."

331
00:31:34.523 --> 00:31:38.072
Muriel's confession aroused
more curiosity than emotion

332
00:31:38.323 --> 00:31:39.802
Claude thought...

333
00:31:40.003 --> 00:31:42.563
it was marketable.
He wanted to publish it...

334
00:31:42.763 --> 00:31:45.561
anonymously, in a limited edition

335
00:31:45.843 --> 00:31:48.721
Muriel refused,
not saying how he'd hurt her

336
00:31:48.923 --> 00:31:50.595
"I've abused myself

337
00:31:51.163 --> 00:31:53.313
"now I know that...

338
00:31:53.883 --> 00:31:56.443
"I'm no longer a pure woman

339
00:31:59.323 --> 00:32:01.837
"it's my duty
to confess this to you

340
00:32:02.363 --> 00:32:04.319
"no shame will stop me

341
00:32:06.603 --> 00:32:08.321
"I am what I am

342
00:32:09.283 --> 00:32:11.877
"if you thought of me
as unsullied...

343
00:32:13.683 --> 00:32:16.322
"now you know you were wrong"

344
00:32:23.043 --> 00:32:24.271
it's all that's left?

345
00:32:25.683 --> 00:32:28.561
Your properties cost more
than they bring in

346
00:32:28.763 --> 00:32:31.072
repairs
on the rue de Bagnolet place...

347
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:35.071
wipe out the income
from the others

348
00:32:35.643 --> 00:32:38.362
what do you advise?

349
00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.872
Sell that one...

350
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:42.119
and keep the two others

351
00:32:42.323 --> 00:32:43.915
I may have a buyer

352
00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.316
I must ask my mother

353
00:32:47.523 --> 00:32:49.036
go ahead... but quickly

354
00:32:49.403 --> 00:32:51.394
buyers don't grow on trees

355
00:32:52.043 --> 00:32:53.271
I'll wait...

356
00:33:06.203 --> 00:33:07.238
I'm sorry to tire you, mother

357
00:33:07.443 --> 00:33:09.911
it's dark in here...
light the gas

358
00:33:32.723 --> 00:33:35.396
the lawyer says
to sell rue de Bagnolet

359
00:33:35.843 --> 00:33:36.832
what do you think?

360
00:33:37.043 --> 00:33:39.079
Whatever you do will be right

361
00:34:12.963 --> 00:34:18.037
Claude was alone. He had lost
the most demanding of all his women

362
00:34:18.323 --> 00:34:20.712
he was free to live his own life

363
00:34:20.923 --> 00:34:22.800
how would he use his freedom?

364
00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:24.716
Anne came back...

365
00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:27.113
more mature... prettier.

366
00:34:27.323 --> 00:34:29.518
Their love-making was restrained

367
00:34:29.723 --> 00:34:31.156
don't look at me

368
00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:33.514
what's this new modesty?

369
00:34:33.763 --> 00:34:35.833
I've seen you naked so often

370
00:34:40.723 --> 00:34:42.315
I'll turn around...

371
00:34:46.123 --> 00:34:48.432
but remember Eurydice!

372
00:34:48.843 --> 00:34:51.118
If our eyes meet, you'll die

373
00:34:52.563 --> 00:34:54.235
what did you say?

374
00:34:54.643 --> 00:34:56.634
Eurydice, the wife of Orpheus

375
00:34:56.883 --> 00:34:58.999
Anne was meant
to love only one man

376
00:34:59.803 --> 00:35:01.919
but if that man wasn't Claude...

377
00:35:02.123 --> 00:35:04.273
she'd go against her instinct

378
00:35:10.203 --> 00:35:11.795
I haven't been honest

379
00:35:13.443 --> 00:35:16.401
there's something
I haven't told you

380
00:35:19.843 --> 00:35:21.959
I didn't come to Paris alone

381
00:35:22.443 --> 00:35:23.239
Diurka?

382
00:35:23.443 --> 00:35:25.911
No, Diurka was Persia

383
00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:27.841
that's finished

384
00:35:29.003 --> 00:35:30.994
I brought Muriel with me

385
00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:36.917
she's in Paris.
Do you want to see her?

386
00:35:38.203 --> 00:35:39.682
I don't know...

387
00:35:41.803 --> 00:35:44.761
I want to see her if she wants it

388
00:35:45.003 --> 00:35:46.641
she wants it

389
00:35:47.603 --> 00:35:49.798
she's afraid
she means nothing to you

390
00:35:50.003 --> 00:35:52.312
she wants to see you
before leaving

391
00:35:54.003 --> 00:35:56.392
does she know about us?

392
00:35:57.203 --> 00:35:58.761
No, nothing at all

393
00:35:59.043 --> 00:36:00.874
but she must be told

394
00:36:04.363 --> 00:36:06.831
you're right... but not yet

395
00:36:07.163 --> 00:36:08.801
no, not yet...

396
00:36:09.283 --> 00:36:10.796
but it must be done

397
00:36:14.123 --> 00:36:16.876
she'll be at my studio tonight...

398
00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:53.561
4 years? Only yesterday!

399
00:36:53.763 --> 00:36:58.154
Muriel held her hand out stiffly
as she had the first time they met

400
00:36:58.603 --> 00:37:00.639
she could only remove her glasses...

401
00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:03.118
once the curtains cut off the light

402
00:37:38.043 --> 00:37:40.637
I've heard nothing from you in ages

403
00:37:41.003 --> 00:37:42.721
nothing that counts

404
00:37:43.363 --> 00:37:44.432
you didn't write, either

405
00:37:44.643 --> 00:37:45.837
I couldn't

406
00:37:46.043 --> 00:37:49.353
after you left, I lost
the normal use of my eyes

407
00:37:49.883 --> 00:37:51.441
Anne was away

408
00:37:51.643 --> 00:37:55.272
my left eye gave out first
and I nearly lost them both

409
00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:58.563
I spent 3 months in total darkness

410
00:38:00.163 --> 00:38:01.915
at that time I thanked god

411
00:38:02.123 --> 00:38:04.637
for not giving you a blind wife

412
00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:06.032
and now?

413
00:38:06.603 --> 00:38:08.116
I'm getting better

414
00:38:08.683 --> 00:38:10.162
I came here...

415
00:38:10.763 --> 00:38:12.799
I was afraid, but I wanted to

416
00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:19.597
Muriel's virtue frightened Claude

417
00:38:19.803 --> 00:38:22.522
he thought of her
as unapproachable

418
00:38:22.843 --> 00:38:25.198
he couldn't touch her
as he had Anne

419
00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:28.395
he felt insincere,
yet he was deeply moved

420
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.639
the surprise came from Muriel

421
00:38:48.603 --> 00:38:50.036
I loved you so much

422
00:38:50.483 --> 00:38:52.201
I lived for you, Muriel

423
00:38:52.523 --> 00:38:54.400
I knew joy and pain...

424
00:39:13.043 --> 00:39:14.556
you're leaving?

425
00:39:15.003 --> 00:39:16.721
You won't stay with me?

426
00:39:17.483 --> 00:39:18.836
I can't...

427
00:39:19.603 --> 00:39:21.355
I wanted to see you again, but...

428
00:39:21.563 --> 00:39:23.918
I didn't expect to be so... affected

429
00:39:24.803 --> 00:39:27.078
I don't know what I think...
or want

430
00:39:28.443 --> 00:39:30.081
- I'll see you again.
- Are you sure?

431
00:39:30.683 --> 00:39:32.321
I must leave now...

432
00:39:35.563 --> 00:39:37.121
I must leave, Muriel!

433
00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.794
I found you at last

434
00:40:01.483 --> 00:40:03.439
here's a letter from Muriel

435
00:40:09.123 --> 00:40:11.193
I know she's still in love with you

436
00:40:21.723 --> 00:40:23.236
she says she loves me...

437
00:40:23.443 --> 00:40:26.116
she wants to go away with me

438
00:40:26.803 --> 00:40:30.079
you must accept
I know you love her, too

439
00:40:30.923 --> 00:40:32.151
yes, I love her...

440
00:40:32.803 --> 00:40:34.521
as much as I did before

441
00:40:35.203 --> 00:40:37.034
you must talk to her first

442
00:40:37.403 --> 00:40:39.280
you must tell her everything

443
00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:43.154
yes

444
00:43:30.963 --> 00:43:32.681
again Muriel had revealed...

445
00:43:32.883 --> 00:43:36.080
the violence
of her suppressed love

446
00:43:36.523 --> 00:43:38.957
Anne took her home
like an invalid

447
00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.877
Muriel wrote Claude
a farewell letter

448
00:43:42.683 --> 00:43:46.039
Anne told me everything,
she wasn't afraid to hurt me

449
00:43:46.243 --> 00:43:48.803
I was horrified... now I'm calm

450
00:43:49.003 --> 00:43:51.881
I know Anne loves you
and always will

451
00:43:52.123 --> 00:43:53.476
she loved you first...

452
00:43:53.683 --> 00:43:56.800
but silently renounced you
for my sake

453
00:43:57.043 --> 00:43:58.954
my selfishness made me blind

454
00:43:59.163 --> 00:44:02.439
she brought you to me...
almost had us engaged

455
00:44:02.843 --> 00:44:06.119
if a woman like Anne or me
gives herself, she's married

456
00:44:06.723 --> 00:44:09.715
do you want two wives
who are sisters?

457
00:44:10.243 --> 00:44:13.553
Anne and I love the same man.
It's tragic but not unusual

458
00:44:14.043 --> 00:44:16.273
I'll probably
always think about you

459
00:44:16.483 --> 00:44:19.122
but part of me
has withdrawn from you

460
00:44:19.683 --> 00:44:21.913
I leave for England in an hour

461
00:44:22.123 --> 00:44:24.478
forgive me for our kiss

462
00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:29.233
for the first time,
Claude suffered...

463
00:44:29.443 --> 00:44:32.162
as he had made
so many others suffer

464
00:44:32.363 --> 00:44:33.955
he was sunk in despair

465
00:44:34.563 --> 00:44:36.440
locked in darkness for days...

466
00:44:36.643 --> 00:44:38.713
he questioned his very identity

467
00:44:38.923 --> 00:44:40.754
waiting for sleep, he'd repeat...

468
00:44:40.963 --> 00:44:43.921
"I am nothing...
I understand nothing"

469
00:44:46.163 --> 00:44:47.835
slowly he healed himself...

470
00:44:48.163 --> 00:44:51.394
by writing a book.
"Jerome and Julien"...

471
00:44:51.643 --> 00:44:54.362
was about a woman
who loved two men

472
00:44:54.563 --> 00:44:58.602
it was his story, transposed
his love for the two sisters

473
00:45:23.203 --> 00:45:26.434
by chance,
Diurka published the book

474
00:45:26.643 --> 00:45:30.352
Claude was cool to him, at first.
Then he got to know and like him

475
00:45:30.683 --> 00:45:32.321
how do you feel about it?

476
00:45:34.043 --> 00:45:35.635
Mostly relieved

477
00:45:35.963 --> 00:45:38.033
writing it, I was unhappy

478
00:45:38.403 --> 00:45:40.439
I was miserable, because...

479
00:45:41.283 --> 00:45:43.956
it stirred up memories.
Now I feel better...

480
00:45:44.323 --> 00:45:47.235
as if the characters
had suffered for me

481
00:45:47.443 --> 00:45:48.671
I understand

482
00:45:49.523 --> 00:45:51.275
I liked your book very much

483
00:45:52.123 --> 00:45:54.273
it stirred up memories for me, too

484
00:45:56.483 --> 00:45:58.838
now I can tell you...
I didn't like you

485
00:45:59.643 --> 00:46:02.032
you got on my nerves, too

486
00:46:02.963 --> 00:46:05.602
Anne had only praise for you

487
00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:07.596
that didn't help any!

488
00:46:08.483 --> 00:46:09.836
Have you seen her?

489
00:46:13.363 --> 00:46:14.955
I wanted to...

490
00:46:16.443 --> 00:46:19.401
I heard she was engaged
to a mountain-climber

491
00:46:20.283 --> 00:46:22.080
she must be married now

492
00:46:22.323 --> 00:46:24.712
no... she broke her engagement

493
00:46:26.363 --> 00:46:27.512
why?

494
00:46:28.963 --> 00:46:32.035
I only know it's off,
I don't know why

495
00:46:34.523 --> 00:46:36.161
still think about her?

496
00:46:41.243 --> 00:46:43.803
Love stories
should be complete...

497
00:46:44.003 --> 00:46:46.358
with a beginning,
middle and end

498
00:46:47.683 --> 00:46:50.243
so our affair with Anne
is probably over

499
00:46:52.523 --> 00:46:54.957
still, I wonder
why she didn't marry him

500
00:46:55.523 --> 00:46:57.434
I know a good way to find out

501
00:46:57.803 --> 00:46:59.361
go and ask her

502
00:47:08.923 --> 00:47:11.756
filled with hope,
Diurka went to Wales

503
00:47:11.963 --> 00:47:14.193
after Persia, he'd let Anne go

504
00:47:14.403 --> 00:47:16.155
he'd been unable to show his love

505
00:47:16.363 --> 00:47:19.514
now he'd convince her
they could start again

506
00:47:19.723 --> 00:47:21.520
he'd persuade her
to come away with him

507
00:47:21.723 --> 00:47:24.078
he'd ask Mrs brown
for Anne's hand

508
00:47:52.243 --> 00:47:53.562
you remember me?

509
00:47:54.483 --> 00:47:55.882
I came to see Anne

510
00:49:11.683 --> 00:49:13.594
then you accept?

511
00:49:14.843 --> 00:49:16.356
I have your word?

512
00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:21.441
May I get Muriel?

513
00:49:36.883 --> 00:49:38.953
I spoke to her.
She accepts now

514
00:49:39.163 --> 00:49:40.596
thank you!

515
00:50:07.643 --> 00:50:10.840
That was why
she broke her engagement

516
00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:15.041
she knew she had tuberculosis

517
00:50:16.443 --> 00:50:19.435
she was superb...
she never told her fiance

518
00:50:19.643 --> 00:50:22.760
she let him think
she'd changed her mind...

519
00:50:23.003 --> 00:50:24.800
that she was capricious

520
00:50:26.043 --> 00:50:27.362
I arrived on a Sunday

521
00:50:27.563 --> 00:50:29.838
Muriel was teaching in the garden

522
00:50:31.043 --> 00:50:32.271
she explained everything

523
00:50:32.483 --> 00:50:34.713
I saw Anne right away...

524
00:50:34.923 --> 00:50:37.596
I persuaded her to see a doctor

525
00:50:38.883 --> 00:50:41.795
she died that afternoon,
before he arrived

526
00:50:43.163 --> 00:50:45.040
but why wouldn't she see a doctor?

527
00:50:45.403 --> 00:50:47.075
She thought it wasn't serious?

528
00:50:47.283 --> 00:50:50.320
I don't think so...
she knew she was dying

529
00:50:53.403 --> 00:50:55.598
maybe it was pride, or heroism

530
00:50:56.083 --> 00:50:59.473
before she died, she said
a beautiful but terrible thing...

531
00:51:01.243 --> 00:51:03.120
"my mouth is full of earth"

532
00:51:04.403 --> 00:51:06.155
how did Muriel take it?

533
00:51:06.443 --> 00:51:09.162
Muriel is like those old women

534
00:51:09.363 --> 00:51:11.831
who can't cry
over death any more

535
00:51:56.763 --> 00:51:58.640
I've had news of Muriel...

536
00:52:01.563 --> 00:52:02.678
from whom?

537
00:52:03.163 --> 00:52:04.801
I've had news

538
00:52:05.363 --> 00:52:08.355
she may go to Brussels
to teach English

539
00:52:08.883 --> 00:52:10.794
she lands at Calais in 2 days

540
00:52:11.643 --> 00:52:12.678
Calais?

541
00:53:09.403 --> 00:53:11.280
Muriel, this is my room

542
00:53:11.763 --> 00:53:14.277
shall we meet downstairs
in half an hour?

543
00:53:14.563 --> 00:53:15.757
Fine

544
00:53:16.403 --> 00:53:17.802
this way, madame...

545
00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:09.363
Claude finally held Muriel,
after 7 years!

546
00:55:09.563 --> 00:55:13.112
He made his intentions clear,
she could have run away

547
00:55:13.523 --> 00:55:15.878
she didn't run away, she was ready

548
00:55:17.123 --> 00:55:19.398
she was 30 years old...
she looked 20

549
00:55:19.603 --> 00:55:22.436
she was new and fresh,
like snow in his hands

550
00:55:31.723 --> 00:55:33.839
he persisted,
expecting her to resist

551
00:55:34.043 --> 00:55:37.035
she did not resist.
She fought for the same goal

552
00:55:52.403 --> 00:55:55.042
he forced her mouth open...

553
00:55:55.403 --> 00:55:57.758
she wanted it, despite her fear

554
00:56:04.803 --> 00:56:07.442
an unknown magnet
thrust them together

555
00:56:10.323 --> 00:56:13.440
the ribbon burst...
less easily than Anne's

556
00:56:24.523 --> 00:56:26.320
there was no tenderness

557
00:56:26.523 --> 00:56:29.515
Claude's aim was
to arm Muriel against him

558
00:56:29.963 --> 00:56:31.237
it was done

559
00:56:41.763 --> 00:56:43.799
red stained her gold

560
00:57:01.243 --> 00:57:02.358
what are you doing?

561
00:57:05.443 --> 00:57:06.922
I'm leaving

562
00:57:11.123 --> 00:57:12.158
why?

563
00:57:13.043 --> 00:57:14.112
Come here...

564
00:57:34.923 --> 00:57:36.561
dearest Claude...

565
00:57:37.403 --> 00:57:40.281
I came to see you
to bury this thing

566
00:57:41.043 --> 00:57:43.273
I'm glad you were the first...

567
00:57:43.483 --> 00:57:46.555
because it's you,
because you wanted it

568
00:57:48.243 --> 00:57:49.562
I shan't cry

569
00:57:54.403 --> 00:57:57.554
listen to me as you once did...

570
00:57:57.923 --> 00:58:00.756
when I told you
love was stirring in me

571
00:58:01.323 --> 00:58:03.883
now I tell you that it must die...

572
00:58:04.323 --> 00:58:05.915
so that I may live

573
00:58:09.163 --> 00:58:10.915
we needn't separate

574
00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:14.196
I took a long time,
but now you're my wife

575
00:58:14.803 --> 00:58:17.317
it's the first time
I've felt so sure...

576
00:58:17.523 --> 00:58:19.161
the very first time

577
00:58:19.483 --> 00:58:21.758
we made love...

578
00:58:22.043 --> 00:58:24.511
you may be pregnant

579
00:58:25.083 --> 00:58:28.075
we'll go to Brittany
and wait for the baby...

580
00:58:28.403 --> 00:58:29.677
by the sea

581
00:58:30.723 --> 00:58:33.476
I was meant to be a mother
and I will be

582
00:58:33.683 --> 00:58:36.481
but there's no room for me
in your life

583
00:58:36.923 --> 00:58:40.040
our love is a dead end,
but it's not shameful

584
00:58:40.723 --> 00:58:43.157
it mustn't be a dead end!

585
00:58:43.403 --> 00:58:45.997
I'm asking you to be my wife

586
00:58:46.203 --> 00:58:49.354
you never were
and never will be a husband

587
00:58:50.123 --> 00:58:51.556
I'll add this...

588
00:58:52.163 --> 00:58:54.518
my act was morally very serious...

589
00:58:54.723 --> 00:58:56.441
but it was my decision

590
00:58:57.123 --> 00:58:58.920
we're from different tribes...

591
00:58:59.123 --> 00:59:01.432
we learned different customs

592
00:59:01.723 --> 00:59:03.953
I'm a puritan in love...

593
00:59:04.483 --> 00:59:07.236
you love me
because you're a bit crazy

594
00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:09.992
please listen to me

595
00:59:10.883 --> 00:59:14.159
it's all true,
but I'm another person now...

596
00:59:14.603 --> 00:59:15.797
thanks to you

597
00:59:16.883 --> 00:59:20.558
you're not my Claude any more
and it's too late to change

598
00:59:21.043 --> 00:59:24.479
your value is in your work,
not in your children

599
00:59:25.323 --> 00:59:26.756
you were my center...

600
00:59:27.123 --> 00:59:29.239
and now I must lose you

601
00:59:30.123 --> 00:59:31.715
we love a person...

602
00:59:32.003 --> 00:59:35.040
for what he is.
We don't try to change him

603
00:59:35.483 --> 00:59:38.281
if we succeeded,
he'd no longer be himself

604
00:59:51.003 --> 00:59:53.676
you taught me love last night

605
00:59:54.403 --> 00:59:56.280
your kisses made me dizzy...

606
00:59:56.603 --> 00:59:57.672
I still hold you

607
00:59:57.883 --> 01:00:01.193
I can live without eyes or legs...
I can live without you

608
01:00:01.843 --> 01:00:04.073
I no longer fear life without you

609
01:00:04.683 --> 01:00:07.072
your ideas sway me
when I'm with you...

610
01:00:07.443 --> 01:00:10.515
afterward,
they shatter against my religion

611
01:00:12.163 --> 01:00:15.633
I'm not sad for you,
you don't need me

612
01:00:17.043 --> 01:00:18.362
god protect you

613
01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:50.040
Claude saw Muriel off

614
01:00:50.243 --> 01:00:52.962
they had half an hour
before her train

615
01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:55.638
Muriel seemed happy and confident

616
01:00:55.843 --> 01:00:57.754
she left and he was alone

617
01:00:57.963 --> 01:00:58.793
between them...

618
01:00:59.243 --> 01:01:01.359
was a dead girl they never named

619
01:01:01.563 --> 01:01:03.758
only a birth
could banish the ghost...

620
01:01:03.963 --> 01:01:06.397
by creating a different trio

621
01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:09.841
"dear Claude,
we knew it might happen...

622
01:01:10.043 --> 01:01:12.841
"and it did:
I'm expecting your child

623
01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:15.796
"praise god, you're alive in me

624
01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:18.238
"the paper is your flesh,
the ink, my blood

625
01:01:18.483 --> 01:01:20.553
"I press to make it enter"

626
01:01:26.203 --> 01:01:28.273
then she wrote again...

627
01:01:34.243 --> 01:01:37.474
this letter is bordered in black

628
01:01:37.803 --> 01:01:40.601
I'm not pregnant after all

629
01:01:41.243 --> 01:01:43.677
it was simply
my deep desire to be

630
01:01:43.883 --> 01:01:46.716
we shan't meet again,
however much I want to

631
01:01:46.923 --> 01:01:50.120
we couldn't surpass
our night in Calais

632
01:01:50.403 --> 01:01:52.792
we recognize happiness
only afterwards

633
01:02:00.923 --> 01:02:02.481
fifteen years have passed

634
01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:05.476
Muriel is married to a schoolteacher

635
01:02:05.683 --> 01:02:07.639
they have a daughter

636
01:02:07.883 --> 01:02:10.602
Mrs brown is dead, the house sold

637
01:02:10.803 --> 01:02:12.873
letters to the browns are returned

638
01:02:15.403 --> 01:02:16.358
fifteen years...

639
01:02:16.563 --> 01:02:18.872
France is snown
with corpses and shrapnel

640
01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:22.075
millions have died...
few remember why

641
01:02:28.603 --> 01:02:29.399
fifteen years...

642
01:02:29.603 --> 01:02:32.401
Claude visits the Rodin museum

643
01:02:32.803 --> 01:02:35.556
the statue of Balzac
is now acclaimed

644
01:02:43.323 --> 01:02:45.041
Claude hears English voices...

645
01:02:45.243 --> 01:02:47.882
schoolgirls, visiting France.
He remembers...

646
01:02:48.123 --> 01:02:49.272
Muriel's photo at ten...

647
01:02:49.483 --> 01:02:51.872
and looks for some resemblance

648
01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.721
could her daughter be there?

649
01:02:54.763 --> 01:02:55.752
This one?

650
01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:57.158
That one?

651
01:02:58.403 --> 01:02:59.472
Or the redhead?

652
01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:01.916
Claude looks at them

653
01:03:02.163 --> 01:03:03.676
he could ask:

654
01:03:03.883 --> 01:03:06.033
"Is one of you
Muriel brown's daughter?"

655
01:03:06.243 --> 01:03:08.074
No. What's the use...

656
01:03:25.043 --> 01:03:25.998
are you free?

657
01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:27.602
I have a fare

658
01:03:31.363 --> 01:03:34.036
what's wrong with me today?
I look old!

659
