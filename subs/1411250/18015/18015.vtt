00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,519
Alright, you ready?

3
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,090
Yeah.

4
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:29,294
Alright, stand back.

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,809
Can I try?

6
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,746
Go ahead.

7
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,714
Get the flame right on the wick.

8
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:54,686
Careful.
OK, stand back.

9
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:07,067
Hey.

10
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:12,136
How's it going?

11
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:16,276
It's going.
Just out taking a walk.

12
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,547
Is it cool if I join you?

13
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:24,847
Yeah.

14
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:28,253
<i>I was young... once.</i>

15
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,656
Be back by eight, yeah?

16
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:36,826
Come on, Dad.
Let's go.

17
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:39,729
<i>When we're young,
we think we're invincible.</i>

18
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:45,605
<i>But then life
teaches you otherwise.</i>

19
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,246
<i>I was 16-years-old
the summer I met Grace Turner.</i>

20
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:06,558
Hey. What are you doing?

21
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,330
I'm throwing this bridge
in the river.

22
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:24,543
Here.
Go ahead. Toss it over.

23
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,715
OK.

24
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:37,754
Doesn't this upset the fish?

25
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:38,858
No.

26
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:42,326
They just move and then

27
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,460
forget why they even moved
in the first place.

28
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:48,565
Whoa.
I'd hate to live like that.

29
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,336
Like what?

30
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,941
Like, not remembering things.

31
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,411
Think about everything
you'd lose.

32
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,549
All the great memories
you wouldn't have.

33
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,419
Well, I guess
I better get going.

34
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,258
OK.

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,335
What would you say if I told you
you were gonna be my first love?

36
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,036
What would you say to that?

37
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:29,373
Um... I don't know what I'd say.

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:35,581
OK. Think about it,
and get back to me when you do.

39
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,757
<i>I had no idea what I was doing.</i>

40
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,697
<i>Our town was trying
to kill us with boredom.</i>

41
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,600
<i>So Hunter insisted
this July 4th would be</i>

42
00:03:56,602 --> 00:04:00,637
<i>the greatest act of rebellion since 1776.</i>

43
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,441
<i>Timmy was more concerned with the
practical matters of manhood.</i>

44
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:08,512
<i>The three of us were in a race to see
who could get to third base first.</i>

45
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,647
So...,
what are you...

46
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,816
what are you doin' tonight?

47
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,619
<i>None of us wanted to lose.</i>

48
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,917
You know,
she totally wants you, man.

49
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,483
I don't know.

50
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:49,519
What do you mean
you don't know?

51
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,324
She told you for Christ's sake.

52
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:54,957
I guess.

53
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,860
Give me that.

54
00:04:56,862 --> 00:05:00,863
No guessing, man, alright?
She wants it bad.

55
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,800
Dude, if I was you,
I'd be getting on that shit.

56
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,702
- Mmm.
- I mean, you gotta make sure

57
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:08,671
she knows that you're the one
calling the shots, you know.

58
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:12,007
I mean, otherwise we might as
well just forget the whole thing.

59
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,577
She probably just wants you
for your body anyway.

60
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,512
Yeah, probably.

61
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:17,848
- Shut up, Tim.
- Ohh!

62
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,585
Come on, guys,
let's get outta here.

63
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:24,954
You guys want any more of this?

64
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,456
- I'm good.
- Nope.

65
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,425
Naw? Alright,
I'm gonna chuck it.

66
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,726
- Do it.
- Chuck it.

67
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:30,961
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

68
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,695
- Here we go!
- Chuck, chuck, chuck!

69
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:33,964
Kaboom!

70
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,872
And the crowd goes wild!

71
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:52,418
Conrad?

72
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,856
<i>My father
left us five years before,</i>

73
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,961
<i>and home hadn't
been the same since.</i>

74
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,663
<i>To fill the void,</i>

75
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,764
<i>my mom had latched
on to me so tight</i>

76
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:10,536
<i>I could barely breathe.</i>

77
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,971
<i>So, today, things were
gonna be different,</i>

78
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:19,608
<i>I had an invitation
I couldn't refuse.</i>

79
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,915
<i>One way or another
I was gonna make my move.</i>

80
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:06,191
Well, look who it is.
Come on. We're all out back.

81
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,838
How 'bout another burger,
Conrad?

82
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,240
Uh, I'm OK.

83
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,913
C'mon, you need to put some more
meat on those bones of yours.

84
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,981
OK, you talked me into it.

85
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,485
There you go.

86
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,651
Eric, could you get me a beer?

87
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,187
Sure thing, Dad.

88
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,522
It's nice of you
to join us, Connie.

89
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:41,690
Your family
didn't have any plans?

90
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:45,228
Uh, well, my mom,
she's outta town,

91
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,697
she's, uh,
out on business right now.

92
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,031
Oh, a working woman, huh?

93
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,966
See, honey,
I told you they existed.

94
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:53,536
That must be so hard.

95
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,839
Dad, tell her to stop.

96
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,640
How 'bout your father,
what does he do?

97
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,909
Oh.

98
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,211
Problem there, Connie?

99
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,978
Eric, just shut it.

100
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,315
See? Always with the attitude.

101
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,851
Be careful, man, you're gonna have
a hard time keeping her in line.

102
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:10,586
Dad, tell him to stop.

103
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:13,656
- Gracie, relax.
- He's trying to embarrass me.

104
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,224
You do that on your own.

105
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:17,260
Stop being such
a shithead, Eric.

106
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,564
Watch the language.

107
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:23,134
Oh, my God!

108
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:28,103
Eric, I think you know better.

109
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,772
C'mon,
I was just jokin' with her.

110
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,176
Right.

111
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:46,759
Hey, Connie!

112
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:53,063
Uh, listen, man,
you like my sister, don't ya?

113
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,098
Yeah, well, I mean...

114
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,967
It's cool, man, don't sweat it.

115
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,001
OK.

116
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,036
Play it cool, OK,

117
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:01,871
don't show her
you're too interested.

118
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,772
But, don't hold back
too much either.

119
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,877
Yeah, I guess.

120
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,945
Gotta make the first move, man.

121
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,348
- Be aggressive.
- Cool.

122
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,052
But not too aggressive, alright,
she's still my little sister.

123
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,119
Yeah.

124
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:20,225
- Good luck, buddy.
- You too, man.

125
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,830
Hey.

126
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:32,672
I'm really sorry about
my family. They're so annoying.

127
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,972
They seem pretty great to me.

128
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:39,074
Well, looks
can be deceiving right?

129
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:40,913
Hm.

130
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:48,984
So, you coming to the fireworks
with us tonight, or what?

131
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:52,756
Uh, well, I kinda told the guys
I'd hang out with them tonight.

132
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,425
Oh.

133
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,863
Let's hope I survive it
alone then.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,937
The winds blowing nice today.

135
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,840
Yeah.

136
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:14,677
Hey, hey, hey.
You two hooking up or what?

137
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,780
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Grace.

138
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,815
Hey, Timmy.
Hey, Hunter.

139
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,783
You, uh, teachin' our boy
the ways of the world?

140
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,852
- Dude, shut up.
- Aw, look at that,

141
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,186
defending his girl, how sweet.

142
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,022
I'm sorry, Grace.

143
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:28,757
Hey, hey, hey, did you
just say sorry to her, man?

144
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,392
Cause, you were supposed to
meet up with us

145
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:31,864
like three hours ago.

146
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,363
It's cool, Conrad,

147
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:37,199
if you wanna hang out with a
buncha children go right ahead.

148
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:41,036
- Ohh! Burn!
- Oh, God! How am I gonna recover from that one?

149
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:44,940
- It hurts!
- Hunter, how am I gonna recover from that?

150
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,076
See you later?

151
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,780
OK.

152
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:51,815
Gentlemen.

153
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,917
- Mmm. How ladylike.
- Ohh, yes. Bye.

154
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,320
- Bye, Grace.
- Have a wonderful day.

155
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,254
You got yourself
a keeper there, Conrad.

156
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,924
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

157
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,459
Hey, calm down, man.

158
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,326
Why'd you have to do that?
You're embarrassing me...

159
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,095
What are you talking about?

160
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:08,765
Dude, I don't even know
where his hands have been.

161
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,032
Where they been, Connie?

162
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:12,001
Obviously not on Grace.

163
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:17,339
Ohh. You hear that, Con?
Obviously not on Grace.

164
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,879
That hurt.
That hurt.

165
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,316
So, you'd, uh,
get a little kiss?

166
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:29,752
No, you totally blew the moment,
dude.

167
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:31,353
- I was going to.
- Blew the moment?

168
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,022
- Yeah.
- Aw, did you hear this, kid?

169
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,390
Yeah, I'm hearing it.

170
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,825
Stop with the angry
game, Con, alright?

171
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,261
You ditched us for her.

172
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,763
I was just leaving to come find
you guys, I swear.

173
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:45,435
Ohh, OK, well, looked like you were just
trying to find something, if you ask me.

174
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,837
Oh, man,
finding something for sure.

175
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,772
Should we even include
him in tonight's plans, Tim?

176
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:52,908
See, uh, I don't know.
I just don't know.

177
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,545
- I don't know either, man.
- Just tell me what's goin' on.

178
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:58,381
Alright, we got wheels.

179
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:02,986
My Granddad's taking the night off, so
we'll snag his truck. He won't even know.

180
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,787
You can't drive.

181
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:08,157
Dude, I got my permit alright,
don't be a pussy.

182
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,261
Why can't we just head over to the
fireworks like everybody else?

183
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,796
Lame. Lame!

184
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:16,031
Oh, we're doing it
with or without you, Con.

185
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,300
I mean, you wanna ditch us
again, go for it.

186
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:22,171
- C'mon, man.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, it's cool, man. Have fun, buddy.

187
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:24,840
See you later.

188
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:26,511
Peace.

189
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:48,000
Alright, Tim, open the trunk
and take the wheel, alright?

190
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:53,372
Go, go!

191
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,375
Open it man, open it.

192
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,845
Let's go, let's go.

193
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,317
Look what I got.

194
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,167
Let's go, c'mon.

195
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,863
- Oh, shit let's go.
- Hunter, let's go. C'mon, c'mon.

196
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:55,131
Go, go, go, go, go.

197
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,001
Damn, dude. You need to stop
pulling that shit.

198
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,036
Jesus, you were loving it
like five seconds ago.

199
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,503
Yeah, what's your deal, man?

200
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,373
I mean, ever since
you started getting pussy,

201
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,641
you've turned into a pussy.

202
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,475
Man's got a point.

203
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,478
You're just jealous 'cause
I'm actually getting some.

204
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,915
Ah, if you're such a man,
then why don't you prove it?

205
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,416
I'm not proving shit to you.

206
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,584
Oh, wow, what do you think, Tim?

207
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:19,555
Think he'd prove something to
shitface Grace if she asked him to?

208
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,690
I bet he would.

209
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:24,127
Yeah, I think so, too.

210
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,430
No real man chooses some chick
over his best buds.

211
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,074
Hey, Tim,
make a left right here.

212
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,314
Fourth house on the right.

213
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:46,285
Dude, you don't have the balls.

214
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:24,020
What the hell? Hey!

215
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:26,025
Eat a dick, bitch!

216
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,658
Did you see the look on his face?

217
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,194
What the hell, Hunter,
he saw me!

218
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,563
Jeez, man, whatever,
OK, it's dark.

219
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,766
He doesn't have a clue. Besides it's
a stupid plant, alright, who cares?

220
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,634
Oh, shit!

221
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,205
Shit.

222
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,041
Alright, chill out, you guys.
Make a right up ahead,

223
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,112
we're gonna lose him
on the outskirts.

224
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,116
Connie, you need to throw that
goddamn plant out the window.

225
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,286
No.

226
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,287
Hunter, what are you doing?

227
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,223
- Hey, don't, hey!
- That's the point, man.

228
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,328
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Calm down.

229
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:06,230
I can't get rid of him!

230
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,504
Got it.

231
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,710
Hey, look out!

232
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,281
Is he OK?

233
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,321
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shut up, Tim.

234
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,028
Oh, my God.

235
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,708
He's still breathing.

236
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:34,883
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- What?

237
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:38,222
It's a public road, Conrad.

238
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:42,391
Someone's gonna
drive by any second,

239
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,360
and when they do,
they'll get help.

240
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,565
And we need to
get the hell outta here.

241
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:52,235
I'm not gonna leave him there to die out
there... we're not gonna leave him.

242
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,139
He's not gonna die, godammit.

243
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:00,312
Look, he's breathing,
Conrad, OK?

244
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,386
Alright, we take a vote, OK?

245
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,755
Hunter, we're not gonna
leave him here!

246
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,359
I say we leave.

247
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,463
We're not gonna leave him.

248
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,198
What's it gonna be, Timmy?

249
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,269
God.

250
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,807
You need to vote, Tim.

251
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,715
Look, I need you to trust me
here, Conrad, alright?

252
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:43,322
Everything is gonna be fine.

253
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,158
C'mon.

254
00:18:58,336 --> 00:18:59,904
Swear to God, I'll leave you.

255
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,467
Hey, I'll take care
of the ornaments, alright?

256
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,742
Conrad?

257
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,978
So you did come home last night?

258
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,814
Yeah, I... I got tied up
with Hunter and Timmy.

259
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:02,418
Tied up? You ran off
when we had a whole day planned.

260
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,791
Mom. I'm sorry. I didn't...

261
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,393
Didn't what?

262
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,865
Come eat breakfast.

263
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,597
What's that?

264
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:48,631
What's what?

265
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,066
On your shirt? Is that blood?

266
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:59,377
Go on, get it.

267
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,450
Hello?

268
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:12,723
Ms. Williams.

269
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:22,998
Morning, Rachel.
This is an early surprise.

270
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:28,740
Oh, my God.

271
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,982
I appreciate you
telling me first.

272
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:41,452
This is terrible,
they must be a mess.

273
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:45,523
Call me if you hear
anything more, will you?

274
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:47,826
Bye-bye to you too.

275
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,623
Hey.

276
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,161
He's dead.

277
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:26,965
Did you hear me, Hunter?

278
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:30,699
I said he's dead.

279
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,903
Whole town's talking about it.

280
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:35,837
Well, what're we gonna do?

281
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,141
What'd you mean?
He hit a deer.

282
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:41,643
Alright, nobody needs to know
any more than that.

283
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:42,878
Hunter, we shoulda
done something.

284
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,078
And just what do you want, Con?

285
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,713
We can't just
bring him back to life

286
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,685
by saying a few words.

287
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,885
What happened, happened, Connie,

288
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:52,587
and there ain't
no changing that.

289
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:54,155
Would you stop
with the damn ball?

290
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:55,724
You know we can go on and on

291
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:57,625
about what we shoulda done,

292
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:59,795
but in the end we still
didn't, alright, we walked.

293
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,830
- And that was our decision.
- That was your decision, Hunter!

294
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:03,599
That was your decision.

295
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:08,170
Oh, yeah, was real nice
of you to help him out.

296
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,875
I said stop with the damn ball.

297
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,547
Guys, guys, guys!
No, stop, stop!

298
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,964
<i>I was furious,</i>

299
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:41,673
<i>at Hunter,
at the pain, at myself.</i>

300
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:45,276
<i>But I had it coming.</i>

301
00:25:46,743 --> 00:25:48,744
<i>Consequences,</i>

302
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:51,246
<i>they don't always
hit you right away,</i>

303
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:54,717
<i>but when they do,
you feel them.</i>

304
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,153
Oh, my God!

305
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,937
Wh... What happened to you?

306
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:16,206
I'm OK.

307
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:24,880
Grace... I just heard.

308
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:32,254
I'm fine.
I just... I'm going for a walk.

309
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:37,292
I, um, I'm stopped now,
but I was going for a walk.

310
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:43,699
Stop, I'm OK. I'm fine.

311
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,870
Jesus, you're covered in blood.

312
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,807
Did Hunter or Timmy
give you that?

313
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:53,842
Hunter.

314
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:57,712
God, why do you
hang out with those dicks?

315
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:00,915
- Grace, I'm really sorry...
- Conrad, I said it's fine.

316
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:05,120
I mean, Jesus Christ, just shut the
hell up for like five seconds?

317
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:12,161
Yeah.

318
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,337
Thanks.

319
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,175
No problem.

320
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:31,316
C'mon. Let's get you cleaned up.

321
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,332
Here, give me that.

322
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,874
Come here.

323
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,883
Where are you parents?

324
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:46,057
Uh, I don't know.
Upstairs probably.

325
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:52,096
I'm sorry about yesterday.

326
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,465
About what?

327
00:28:56,467 --> 00:29:01,269
I was just... I was angry,

328
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:04,475
and I wanted it to feel right
when it happened.

329
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,009
I mean,
I've kissed other boys before,

330
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,978
but with you, I don't know.

331
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,486
I wanted it to be, like,
important, you know?

332
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:24,095
Um... you lost a lotta blood.

333
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:27,895
Want some juice or something?

334
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:30,100
Uh, sure.

335
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:42,978
- Apple or orange?
- Orange.

336
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,614
Correct. That's a point.

337
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:48,083
A point?

338
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,521
Yeah, I'm keeping score for you.

339
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:54,088
You're at three now.

340
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,426
- What if I wanted apple?
- Well, we don't even have apple,

341
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,864
so you definitely would have
lost a point.

342
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,132
What are my other
two points for?

343
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:10,008
Well, one is for my parents,
I think they like you.

344
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:13,043
And the other one?

345
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,848
Never mind that one.

346
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:29,594
Grace, can I...
can I tell you something?

347
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:34,196
Just say it.

348
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,668
Just give me a sec.

349
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,609
Oh, Grace, I'm sorry.

350
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,586
Hey, listen.

351
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,923
We heard about what happened,
and wanted to do something.

352
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,690
This is not much, but...

353
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:08,462
It's... It's, um, tuna noodle
casserole, the recipe your mom loves.

354
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:11,967
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

355
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,536
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, uh, Conrad.

356
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,271
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, her friend.

357
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:21,709
We live across the street.
Are you OK?

358
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,883
Yeah, oh, yeah,
I had a bloody nose earlier.

359
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:29,484
I think Mr. and Mrs. Turner
are upstairs.

360
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:31,119
I could tell 'em you stopped by?

361
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,391
- That'd be great, yeah.
- I'm here, Conrad.

362
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:38,896
Thank you.

363
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:44,231
Um... this helps.

364
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:47,702
- How's Lynn doing?
- Ah, it's gonna take some time.

365
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:51,707
Conrad, maybe you should go home

366
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,475
and get cleaned up, OK.

367
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:56,311
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

368
00:31:56,313 --> 00:32:00,481
You need anything, I mean,
anything, don't hesitate.

369
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:01,919
I mean it.

370
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:05,554
Bye.

371
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,688
Bye.

372
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:17,134
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

373
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,367
It is in the times
when confronted with death,

374
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:57,405
that we are reminded how truly
precious life is.

375
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:02,744
This is never more present than when a
life is taken away at such a young age.

376
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:06,515
It is not always evident in the
moment as to the ways of our world,

377
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,717
and it causes us to question,

378
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:13,721
for it is through this imperfect world
of ours that we all must travel,

379
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,624
and as Eric has done
as he leaves this earth...

380
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,596
<i>I wasn't invited.</i>

381
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:24,534
<i>But I forced myself to bear
witness to what I had done.</i>

382
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,097
Hey, a little help over here?

383
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:04,639
Thanks.

384
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,278
Yeah, I figured
it was you up here.

385
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:18,322
Man, he really did a number
on you the other day, huh?

386
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,391
Uh, yeah, for what it's worth,
I think he's sorry.

387
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:26,894
Thanks for the apology, huh.
Thanks.

388
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:30,233
C'mon man. You know how he is.

389
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:33,702
Man, I don't even
care about that.

390
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,140
What are you up here for?
What do you want?

391
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,412
I've been thinking about
Eric's family.

392
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:44,548
Better get used to it.

393
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:49,419
'Cause now we have to
for the rest of our lives.

394
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,387
What if we said something,
you know?

395
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,391
What if we... what if we
did something to fix it?

396
00:34:56,393 --> 00:35:00,465
Timmy, he's dead.
Can't fix that.

397
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,526
Hello?

398
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:33,628
<i>Hey.</i>

399
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,429
Oh, hey.

400
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:39,633
- <i>Can you come over?</i>
- What's going on?

401
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:41,538
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

402
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,610
Yeah.

403
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:52,782
<i>It's easy to think that
life will fix your problems for you,</i>

404
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:57,586
<i>somehow everything
will turn out alright.</i>

405
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,820
Psst.

406
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,858
Hey. Climb up.

407
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:06,663
<i>That's the thing about fear,</i>

408
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,202
<i>it can convince you
of anything.</i>

409
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:30,818
C'mon. We gotta be quiet.

410
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:56,279
Just watch where you step.

411
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:00,985
I know it's a mess.

412
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:22,539
OK... when you left
the picnic that day,

413
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:26,574
you said you couldn't
stop by the fireworks.

414
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:27,876
Yeah, well, I told the guys...

415
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,580
Will you just shut up
and let me talk?

416
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,684
I don't care that you didn't, I
just need to get this out, alright?

417
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,418
Alright.

418
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:43,657
After the picnic,
Eric and I got in a fight.

419
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:46,026
I don't even know
what it was about,

420
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:51,833
but... I told him
that I didn't want him to come

421
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,802
to the fireworks.

422
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:58,775
He didn't come because of me,
Conrad.

423
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:05,650
If I hadn't... he wouldn't...

424
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:11,956
It's not your fault, Grace.

425
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,561
It's not your fault.

426
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,864
Sorry.... Um...

427
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,442
Wha... Come here.

428
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:55,693
- Sleep with me?
- What?

429
00:39:56,992 --> 00:39:59,760
Don't be stupid,
just sleep next to me.

430
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:02,031
Just for a little while.

431
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:06,670
What about your parents?

432
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,104
It's just that...

433
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:13,611
I haven't been able
to sleep for days, and...

434
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,980
I think it would help.

435
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,818
OK.

436
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:36,824
Gracie?

437
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:40,231
Yeah, Mom,
just getting the paper.

438
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,237
- Bye.
- Bye.

439
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:08,759
<i>Suddenly, it struck me...</i>

440
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:17,067
<i>one day... Grace will be older
than her older brother,</i>

441
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:24,841
<i>she would grow up,
follow her dreams...</i>

442
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,645
<i>but he would always be 19.</i>

443
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:02,211
Hey. What're you doing?

444
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:06,983
Eric was gonna...

445
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,289
Gracie's out riding her bike.

446
00:43:21,697 --> 00:43:24,999
She's gonna be awhile.

447
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:29,706
You need any help with this?

448
00:43:30,806 --> 00:43:33,074
No. Naw, I'm good.

449
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:35,909
You sure?

450
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:37,077
I got it.

451
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,215
I'd be happy to do whatever.

452
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:54,999
Alright. Knock yourself out.

453
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:02,403
Um... take out the one-bys

454
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:05,440
and then, uh,
take it down with the frame.

455
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,945
- Got it.
- Alright.

456
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,782
There you go.

457
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:34,704
<i>Grief has a way of
uncovering the things we'd rather hide.</i>

458
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,139
Hi, Connie. Come on inside,

459
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:41,444
I made some lemonade
to take the heat off.

460
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:49,820
<i>Sometimes it pulls us
together, sometimes it pulls us apart.</i>

461
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,354
How's Gracie, Conrad?

462
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:01,097
- Um, she seems alright.
- That's good. That's good.

463
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:12,076
He was just like you, you know.

464
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:18,146
Not now, I mean,
but when he was your age.

465
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,452
Her brother was much different
with her when she was young.

466
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:29,460
Don't forget
that part of you, OK?

467
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:36,199
- What's going on?
- Hey, Grace.

468
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,269
Your mom was just
giving me a glass of lemonade.

469
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:44,141
There's some more in the fridge.

470
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:57,851
What's your Mom like?

471
00:45:57,853 --> 00:45:59,854
Total freak.

472
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:01,588
Without my Dad, it's like

473
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,325
she thinks I'm his
replacement or something.

474
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:08,465
I mean, all I wanna do
is just be a kid, you know.

475
00:46:10,432 --> 00:46:14,901
God, I just don't
get them sometimes.

476
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:16,037
It's weird, right?

477
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,039
Like, but when we were younger,

478
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,907
they were sorta like gods.

479
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:21,575
All knowing or all powerful.

480
00:46:21,577 --> 00:46:24,311
And had all
the answers in the world.

481
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:25,612
Yeah, totally.

482
00:46:25,614 --> 00:46:28,983
But then, like,
you wake up one day,

483
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:35,291
and you realize that your parents are
just as crazy and messed up as we are.

484
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:45,067
Whoa, what is this place?

485
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,940
C'mon, I'll show you.

486
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,916
Whoa, cool.

487
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:07,121
So, is this like
where you and the guys hang out?

488
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:11,025
No, they don't even know
about this place.

489
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:15,164
- Well, why not?
- I don't know.

490
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:17,632
I just don't think they'd get it

491
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,202
if I brought them here,
you know?

492
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:26,275
I like you.

493
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:33,481
I feel different around you
than I do with the guys.

494
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,684
Oh...
I would hope so!

495
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:40,320
Shut up.
That's not what I mean.

496
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:43,359
I mean, I can be myself more.

497
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:47,161
You know, say what's on my mind.

498
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:50,601
Instead of
all that stupid stuff.

499
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:57,304
I like how you worry about me,
and that look you give me.

500
00:47:57,306 --> 00:48:01,944
I don't really know what it is,
but I like it.

501
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:09,653
So, do you think someone
used to live here, or what?

502
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:13,954
Yeah, I guess.

503
00:48:13,956 --> 00:48:16,192
Something must have
happened though.

504
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:26,333
- It's totally a mess now.
- Yeah.

505
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:29,070
I mean,
it's not as bad as your room.

506
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,675
Shut up.

507
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:40,548
- Pick something out.
- Huh?

508
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,987
Anything.
Anything you want, pick it out.

509
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,257
OK.

510
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:51,995
Um... here.

511
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,262
What about this?

512
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:59,099
- That?
- Yeah.

513
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,304
Are you sure?

514
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:04,541
OK, c'mon.

515
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:08,044
What are we doing?

516
00:49:22,324 --> 00:49:23,391
Hurry, quick,
before it burns out.

517
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,661
OK.

518
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,147
I know it's dumb, but this stuff
has so much history.

519
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:52,286
These things people used to
love, they're just objects,

520
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:55,423
but they've been
through so much, you know?

521
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:59,463
Sometimes people forget
that history's all still there.

522
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:06,135
But it's weird like,
you burn it, and it's gone.

523
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:10,106
You were the last person
in its life.

524
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:15,011
...and suddenly nothing's left.

525
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,482
Where's that all go?

526
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:46,773
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

527
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:51,280
I'm Katherine Stevens,
um, Conrad's Mom.

528
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:54,115
Uh, come in.

529
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:01,222
Um, I was so devastated when
I heard about your loss.

530
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,257
I hope he hasn't been
too much of a fuss?

531
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:06,827
Connie?
No, no, he's a real good kid.

532
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:09,699
He's a pleasure
to have around here anytime.

533
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,236
Is he here by any chance?

534
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:50,673
You're beautiful.

535
00:51:52,574 --> 00:51:56,577
Guys aren't beautiful,
they're handsome.

536
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,617
Beautiful, too.

537
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:04,753
So are you.

538
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:11,160
Wanna see something?

539
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,459
There's more?

540
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:22,869
Whoa. What happened?

541
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:27,541
When I was eight, Eric and I got
into a fight about something,

542
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:31,311
and he pushed me into a pole
down in our basement,

543
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:33,780
and a screw on it
dug into my back.

544
00:52:33,782 --> 00:52:36,516
Ah, jeez. That had to hurt, huh?

545
00:52:36,518 --> 00:52:39,586
No...
it didn't, actually.

546
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:42,690
That's the funny part,
I didn't even know it happened

547
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,758
until he told me
that I was covered in blood.

548
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,528
It was 13 stitches.

549
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,932
Scar'll probably
be there forever.

550
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:53,367
It's ugly though, huh?

551
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:56,840
No. No, I like it.

552
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:05,748
Guess we better get going, huh?

553
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:08,751
Yeah.

554
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:21,461
Oh. Um, hi. I'm Kathy Stevens.
Conrad's mom.

555
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:23,963
Ah, my hands are filthy.
Sorry 'bout that.

556
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:26,432
Uh, I see you're
building something outside.

557
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:29,536
Uh, yeah, it's a new gazebo.

558
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:32,943
So, Conrad told me
that you were away on business.

559
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:35,778
Excuse me?

560
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:03,737
What are you doing...?

561
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:04,938
Would you stop?

562
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,539
I can't believe
you went over there!

563
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:08,342
I was doing something nice.

564
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,010
Don't you think I wanna see
where my son's disappeared

565
00:54:10,012 --> 00:54:11,545
for the last two weeks?

566
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:12,912
Don't you think I worry?!

567
00:54:12,914 --> 00:54:15,382
Yeah, Mom,
I'm sure you get real upset.

568
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:17,483
I don't like your tone.

569
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:20,387
Eh, I don't... I don't know
what's goin' on with you!

570
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:23,389
- Hunter and Timmy said...
- Hunter and Timmy are assholes, Mom!

571
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:25,525
- What are you two up to?
- Just hangin' out.

572
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:27,594
You said it yourself,
I should watch out for her.

573
00:54:27,596 --> 00:54:31,331
I didn't tell you to spend
every waking moment with her.

574
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:33,400
I got news for you, kiddo.

575
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:37,773
As long as you live under
my roof, you owe me answers.

576
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,874
- Fine.
- Where you goin'?

577
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:43,077
- Just get outta the way, Mom.
- Where you think you're goin'?

578
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,845
- Don't you... no...
- Move, just move. Just move!

579
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:18,572
Wow, you guys
built this in grade school?

580
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:21,778
Yeah. My Dad helped us build it.

581
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,512
We barely ever
come here anymore, though.

582
00:56:26,514 --> 00:56:28,981
You shouldn't even be in here,
actually.

583
00:56:28,983 --> 00:56:34,787
Seriously?
No girls policy.

584
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:37,826
Yeah, well, it's kinda like our place, ya know?

585
00:56:39,494 --> 00:56:42,061
I thought you didn't hang out
with them anymore?

586
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:44,800
Yeah, I guess.

587
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:53,474
That was a while ago.

588
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:57,514
Awww. Aren't you guys cool.

589
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,050
So now what?

590
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:18,231
Hey, go slow.
Hold on, hold on.

591
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:19,999
Sorry.

592
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:22,572
OK, it's OK. Just go slow.

593
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:30,579
Holy shit.

594
00:57:31,547 --> 00:57:33,813
Wha... What's up, man?

595
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:37,217
Oh, what's up, man?
You tell me, playboy?

596
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:39,086
Nothing,
we were just hangin' out.

597
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,655
OK, these two were
just hangin' out, Timmy.

598
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:45,124
- Oh, that's cool.
- Oh, wait. Oh, wait, I'm sorry,

599
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:47,260
did I say, "hanging out,"
'cause what I meant to say was

600
00:57:47,262 --> 00:57:49,595
Conrad's over here finger-blasting
the hell outta Grace.

601
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:51,164
- Dude, Hunter, shut up.
- You shut up!

602
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:54,767
Let's just get outta here,
dude, they're fine.

603
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,304
- How's this not piss you off?
- Are you two gonna leave?

604
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,072
'Cause we were
just getting started,

605
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:01,510
and I'd really like
to get back to it.

606
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:07,584
C'mon. C'mon, let's go.

607
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,720
Jesus.

608
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:20,894
What the hell, man?

609
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:24,167
Grow up, Hunter.

610
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:29,670
<i>I'm seriously sorry about that.</i>

611
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,238
Stop apologizing for them.

612
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,208
I bet neither of them
even kissed a girl before.

613
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,012
What are they doing?

614
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,847
Um, they're heading up north
for the night.

615
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:43,749
For what?

616
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:46,822
To pack up Eric's dorm room.

617
00:58:47,722 --> 00:58:48,925
You're not going?

618
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:51,860
No.

619
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:56,162
- Don't you think you should?
- God, stop.

620
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:59,166
- What?
- You sound just like them.

621
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:03,269
I'd just get in the way
and be miserable the whole time.

622
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:06,606
Besides, if I don't go,

623
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:09,141
then we'd have
the place to ourselves.

624
00:59:09,143 --> 00:59:12,012
You don't think your parents
have thought of that?

625
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:14,947
Yeah, they gave me this whole
lecture on trust and stuff.

626
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:17,219
But I'm not a child.

627
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:26,092
Sleep with me tonight, Conrad.

628
00:59:26,094 --> 00:59:29,195
It's just that, I just...

629
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:32,067
wanted things to be
about us right now. Ya know?

630
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:38,405
I want to. I just...
I just...

631
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:40,673
What? What?

632
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:42,277
- I don't know.
- What, what?

633
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:50,416
Well, I guess
you think about it,

634
00:59:50,418 --> 00:59:56,222
and then you can come back later tonight...
Whatever happens, happens.

635
00:59:56,224 --> 01:00:02,731
But... if you do want to,
then we need to be ready.

636
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:05,134
Know what I mean?

637
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:08,434
Yeah, think so.

638
01:00:08,436 --> 01:00:12,271
Alright.
See you later tonight?

639
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:14,009
Alright.

640
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,336
There you go.

641
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:44,072
Can I help you with something?

642
01:00:45,407 --> 01:00:47,410
No. I'm good.

643
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:20,142
Sorry.

644
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,878
Is that all?

645
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,215
Yeah. And some condoms, too.

646
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,854
- What's that?
- Um, some condoms, please.

647
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:34,354
What kind?

648
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:37,160
I don't care. It doesn't matter.

649
01:01:49,036 --> 01:01:51,139
Eighteen seventy-nine.

650
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:54,840
Oh.

651
01:01:54,842 --> 01:01:57,144
Watch where you're goin', dude.

652
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,981
You watch it.

653
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,083
- Hey, hold up, man.
- Just stay away from me.

654
01:02:04,085 --> 01:02:08,454
Look... I'm sorry.

655
01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:09,822
Alright.

656
01:02:09,824 --> 01:02:12,461
No, no, no, seriously,
I am, OK?

657
01:02:14,262 --> 01:02:17,930
It's just not the same
without you around.

658
01:02:17,932 --> 01:02:20,800
I mean, we're all supposed
to be in this together, right?

659
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,469
And now Tim doesn't
even wanna talk to me anymore.

660
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:24,871
Oh, so now because you lost
your two best friends

661
01:02:24,873 --> 01:02:27,009
you feel bad
that we let some kid die?

662
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:32,311
Hey, can we just
talk for a minute?

663
01:03:55,496 --> 01:03:58,063
I didn't think
you'd ever get here.

664
01:03:58,065 --> 01:03:59,100
Hi.

665
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:05,338
Wow, you look beautiful.

666
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,043
Thanks.

667
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:54,589
Have you ever played
"what if", Conrad?

668
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,359
What do you mean?

669
01:04:59,628 --> 01:05:01,998
What if our lives never crossed?

670
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:06,499
Like, what if we never met?

671
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:08,668
You wouldn't be in my life.

672
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:11,374
And everything
would be different.

673
01:05:14,675 --> 01:05:17,078
This whole summer
would be different.

674
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:22,984
Yeah, it would be.

675
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:28,423
You make me really happy.

676
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:30,085
You OK?

677
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,465
You OK?

678
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:48,336
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

679
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:54,110
Was last night OK?

680
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,543
Yeah. It was perfect, right?

681
01:06:57,545 --> 01:07:00,315
Yeah, totally.

682
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,119
You sure you're alright?

683
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:07,556
I'm great.

684
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:18,664
What are you doing?

685
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:20,499
Goin' to church.
Mr. and Mrs. Morris

686
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:22,267
will be here to pick me up
any minute.

687
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:26,275
- Are you gonna be gone long?
- No, just a couple hours.

688
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:29,611
You can make yourself
at home though.

689
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,117
My parents won't be back
until the night.

690
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:31,206
Grace, we're home.

691
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:45,121
She's in the shower.

692
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:11,613
Where is she?

693
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,246
She went to church.

694
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:15,815
You're not supposed
to be home...

695
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:18,787
We welcomed you into our home,
and this is what you do?

696
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:20,923
Mr. Turner...

697
01:09:22,957 --> 01:09:24,492
Leave.

698
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,748
Hi, Grace.

699
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:49,514
Hey.

700
01:09:49,516 --> 01:09:52,352
- Do you, do you have a second?
- Can you just leave me alone?

701
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,858
- It's important, OK.
- What do you want?

702
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:13,841
I want to say, um...
I'm sorry.

703
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:18,479
Sorry for, uh, for everything.

704
01:10:19,747 --> 01:10:21,580
I just, uh, needed to say that.

705
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:26,354
Jesus, you're a spaz.

706
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:31,593
<i>What if lies
don't cover up the past?</i>

707
01:10:35,663 --> 01:10:37,599
<i>Maybe they cover up
the present.</i>

708
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:41,904
<i>Turn us inside out,</i>

709
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:46,541
<i>and force themselves
to the surface.</i>

710
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:52,644
I'm not gonna to stop
seeing him, Dad.

711
01:10:52,646 --> 01:10:54,714
Frankly, Grace,
after what you've done,

712
01:10:54,716 --> 01:10:57,482
you have no choice
in the matter.

713
01:10:57,484 --> 01:10:58,750
Grace.

714
01:10:58,752 --> 01:10:59,852
- Don't you turn your back.
- No!

715
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:01,620
- We trusted you!
- Let go of me.

716
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:03,822
You promised
you wouldn't betray that trust!

717
01:11:03,824 --> 01:11:06,326
And yet you go right ahead
and walk all over it,

718
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:07,826
right when your mother and I
needed you most!

719
01:11:07,828 --> 01:11:10,028
You both just can't
stand the fact

720
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,830
that I found something good.

721
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:13,900
That something
actually makes me happy.

722
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:17,669
- Gracie, please. Stop.
- Grace. Honey,

723
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:19,604
you need to be
honest with yourself,

724
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:23,343
and do what's right
for this family.

725
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:24,910
You gotta be kidding me.

726
01:11:24,912 --> 01:11:28,447
Grace,
It's already been decided.

727
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:34,086
Decided by who? The two of you?

728
01:11:34,088 --> 01:11:37,557
You've barely even talked to
each other since Eric died.

729
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,994
You... you've barely even
looked at me since he died.

730
01:11:41,996 --> 01:11:43,495
He has nothing to do with this.

731
01:11:43,497 --> 01:11:45,867
He has everything
to do with it, Mom!

732
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:55,808
Grace!

733
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:57,613
Grace!

734
01:12:03,885 --> 01:12:05,554
Conrad?

735
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,460
Conrad?

736
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:20,866
Oh, my God! Conrad!

737
01:12:20,868 --> 01:12:24,739
Thank God. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

738
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:37,916
You... You OK?

739
01:12:37,918 --> 01:12:42,053
- Your parent's came home.
- I know, but listen,

740
01:12:42,055 --> 01:12:45,791
I don't care about what
they said, or what they want,

741
01:12:45,793 --> 01:12:47,692
or about them at all.

742
01:12:47,694 --> 01:12:51,062
You're the only one
that I care about anymore.

743
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:56,035
Just...
just run away with me.

744
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:58,470
- What?
- I'm serious. Let's just go.

745
01:12:58,472 --> 01:13:00,005
Our parents are crazy.

746
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:02,642
We're better off alone
without them, together.

747
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,643
- Say you'll think about it.
- Grace, listen. Grace, listen.

748
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:06,211
You've already runaway.
We could live here for a while,

749
01:13:06,213 --> 01:13:09,016
- and plan something out.
- Grace, stop!

750
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,723
What is it?

751
01:13:18,725 --> 01:13:21,130
Conrad, talk to me.

752
01:13:31,538 --> 01:13:33,876
I let your brother die.

753
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:38,844
Wh.. What?

754
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:41,680
- I'm sorry.
- Wh.. what are you talking about?

755
01:13:41,682 --> 01:13:44,217
The night of the accident
I was out with Hunter and Timmy,

756
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,184
and it was just supposed to be
this prank,

757
01:13:46,186 --> 01:13:48,220
and nobody was
supposed to be home, but he was.

758
01:13:48,222 --> 01:13:50,723
- Slow down.
- He chased us and he hit that deer.

759
01:13:50,725 --> 01:13:52,758
You're not making any sense.
What are you talking about?

760
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:59,130
He hit the tree, and we didn't,
we didn't stay, I wish we had.

761
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:02,637
No, no, he was alone.

762
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:05,440
He wasn't, Grace.

763
01:14:09,944 --> 01:14:14,045
This isn't...
this isn't funny.

764
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:18,453
This isn't a fun joke, don't...
tell me you're joking.

765
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:28,527
It's true.

766
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:30,295
Oh, my God, it's true,

767
01:14:30,297 --> 01:14:32,697
- I can see it in your face.
- Grace, please.

768
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:35,634
- You watched him die.
- I didn't watch him die, Grace.

769
01:14:35,636 --> 01:14:38,803
- I wanted to stay, I wanted to help him.
- You said you were there.

770
01:14:38,805 --> 01:14:40,208
I did.

771
01:14:41,309 --> 01:14:43,209
Oh, my God.

772
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:46,211
- Why would you do that to me?
- Grace, stop, listen.

773
01:14:46,213 --> 01:14:48,951
No, don't tell me to stop.

774
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:54,990
I let you sleep with me, Conrad!

775
01:14:55,923 --> 01:14:58,226
I let you sleep with me.

776
01:14:59,894 --> 01:15:02,164
Grace, I love you.

777
01:15:07,702 --> 01:15:12,037
I don't want to see your face.

778
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:16,211
I never want to
see anything of you ever again.

779
01:15:55,015 --> 01:15:59,120
Mom? Dad?

780
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:00,948
What's wrong?

781
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:07,889
Gracie!

782
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:22,837
I'm sorry.

783
01:17:29,476 --> 01:17:32,244
<i>We thought he'd be OK.</i>

784
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:36,685
And then when he wasn't...

785
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,088
I just didn't know what to do.

786
01:17:41,756 --> 01:17:43,792
You mighta
saved that boy's life...

787
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,429
and you might not have.

788
01:17:49,162 --> 01:17:52,900
Gonna be an old man one day
and you'll still wonder.

789
01:17:57,904 --> 01:17:59,871
Yeah.

790
01:17:59,873 --> 01:18:01,275
OK.

791
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:18,025
<i>As we get older, we
all come to a fork in the road.</i>

792
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:26,400
<i>As we choose our path,
some of us grow wiser...</i>

793
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,871
<i>and some of us don't.</i>

794
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,743
<i>Some relationships last...</i>

795
01:18:35,976 --> 01:18:37,979
<i>some disappear.</i>

796
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:46,220
<i>But what once was,
can't stay the same...</i>

797
01:18:49,422 --> 01:18:52,493
<i>no matter how much
we wish it otherwise.</i>

798
01:18:55,095 --> 01:18:58,500
<i>Truth is, no one gets it right,</i>

799
01:19:00,134 --> 01:19:03,003
<i>but I think we're
all supposed to try.</i>

800
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:33,499
Mr. Turner, please.

801
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:36,304
There's something
I need to tell you.

802
01:19:45,112 --> 01:19:46,914
I'm sorry.

803
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,521
<i>I don't remember what
I said on that porch that evening,</i>

804
01:19:55,523 --> 01:19:59,394
<i>or how her parents
exactly reacted.</i>

805
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:10,068
<i>Moments like that,
they cloud your memory.</i>

806
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,006
<i>Leave only a feeling...</i>

807
01:20:14,307 --> 01:20:17,011
<i>a feeling you can't ever shake.</i>

808
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,497
<i>Wherever she is,
I hope she's OK.</i>

809
01:20:38,164 --> 01:20:42,170
<i>Losing someone, you don't
really ever get over it.</i>

810
01:20:44,537 --> 01:20:46,537
I'm home.

811
01:20:46,539 --> 01:20:48,042
Hey.

812
01:20:49,577 --> 01:20:52,177
You have a good night?

813
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:54,382
Yeah. Pretty good, I guess.

814
01:20:58,985 --> 01:21:00,322
Well, that's good.

815
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:04,226
Go on inside
and tell your Mom you're home.

816
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,460
Mom.

817
01:21:08,462 --> 01:21:11,463
<i>Making peace
with the past, well,</i>

818
01:21:11,465 --> 01:21:14,168
<i>sometimes it seems impossible.</i>

819
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:19,304
<i>Maybe it's supposed to be.</i>

820
01:21:19,306 --> 01:21:22,042
Dad, you coming?

821
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,512
Yeah.

822
01:21:26,146 --> 01:21:27,916
I'm coming, Eric.

823
