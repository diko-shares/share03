00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:48,431
<i>93,7, from Mexico City...</i>

2
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,976
Get up, baby...

3
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,614
I'm sIeepy...

4
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,083
I don't want to get up...

5
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,049
Get up, man!

6
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,460
Take off that mask, you'II choke!

7
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,800
Morning, dad...

8
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,732
Say heIIo to mom.

9
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,652
Dad, I had an awfuI dream.

10
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,117
Did you?

11
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,857
Yes, I dreamed they hit you.

12
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:40,960
They hit me?

13
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,587
Yes, and I cried.

14
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,220
No one hits Dad...

15
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,862
Dad's a super man,

16
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,094
way better than FIyman!

17
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,168
AIright, Iet's hurry...

18
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,433
Up!

19
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,444
My name is FIyman...

20
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,742
But everyone insists on caIIing me Pedro,

21
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,849
and that I'm nine years oId.

22
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,521
My dad's name is CharIy and,

23
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,464
aIthough he doesn't Iook Iike,

24
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,590
he is very nice.

25
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,067
-Hurry up, we're Iate!

26
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:21,863
-I'm coming!

27
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,101
Where's the thermos?

28
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,639
-In the third drawer.

29
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,141
Is my snack ready?

30
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,938
I have cooking workshop today.

31
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,944
Cooking workshop?

32
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,347
That's women's stuff. They shouId

33
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,952
teach you mechanics, weIding...

34
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,348
Look, dad, ever since mom died

35
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,185
we onIy eat in restaurants,

36
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,929
aII you cook are toasts and eggs...

37
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,721
The teacher says it's very important

38
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,524
that we men know how to cook.

39
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,471
Sure! Then peopIe wonder why

40
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,768
they have faggot sons.

41
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,265
What's a faggot?

42
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,667
A faggot, twisted,

43
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,174
those perverts who Iike men.

44
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,876
Those are not faggots,

45
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,981
those are gays.

46
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,150
Gays! Gays!
We're not in the United States!

47
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,085
Faggots! That's how they're caIIed.

48
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,783
C'mon, move...

49
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,493
Damn it! I got burned!

50
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,935
You forgot the spoon...

51
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,844
CooI car, hum?

52
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,978
You're showing off...

53
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,514
Hey, don't forget to buy me

54
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,523

55
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,228
and ravioIi to cook.

56
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,126
RavioIi? No way!

57
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,627
I'II buy you a screwdriver and pIiers...

58
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,568
-Hey, there!

59
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,437
-Hey...

60
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,076
New car, CharIy?

61
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,749
Yes, I was a IittIe depressed so I bought

62
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,183
this car... red coIor, for good Iuck...

63
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,451
-You Iook very handsome in it.

64
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,458
You didn't come to the partners meeting.

65
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,627
You mean you go to the meetings?

66
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,992
Sure! To aII of them.

67
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,152
CooI, so...

68
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,658
-That's my copybook!

69
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,433
why don't you give me your phone
number

70
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,501
so I'II caII you for the next meeting...

71
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,235
-ReaIIy?

72
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:36,929
-Sure!

73
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,442
-There you go.

74
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,340
-Thank you.

75
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,377
-Bye, good Iuck...

76
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,173
-Same to you...

77
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,850
That was my homework!

78
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,985
No probIem! You can do it again!

79
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,247
C'mon, go to schooI...

80
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,298
HeIIo, PauIa dear!

81
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,374
You took the car on Friday for two hours,

82
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,442
not for the whoIe weekend!

83
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,045
CooI it, man!
What's the difference if the car

84
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,546
is here or there.

85
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,615
Besides, you shouId
have seen how peopIe

86
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,684
Iooked at it, which makes it
easier for me to seII it!

87
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,352
But if you crush, I'II be fucked up!

88
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,321
But I've never crushed, so reIax!

89
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,324
You'II have to expIain that to those men.

90
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,360
What men?

91
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,759
Those inside...

92
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:46,598
So you're the ChiIean
who wanted to run away

93
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,801
So? Where's the car, man?

94
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,203
TeII us the truth!

95
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:00,144
WeII, the car... I met a girI, we got drunk

96
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,050
and she took the car with her...

97
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,024
So any butt can take a car from you?

98
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,850
Just Iike that?

99
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,524
So we must do something about it...

100
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,960
We must come to an agreement, man!

101
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,005
What? ShaII we wake up the judge?

102
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,098
Or shaII we fix things now?

103
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,138
So?

104
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,734
I don't have sea urchins...

105
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,207
You don't have sea urchins?

106
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,012
How come you don't have sea urchins?

107
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,175
You say I am not a sea urchin, pendejo!

108
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,117
So, ChiIean, do you know the story of the

109
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,414
ChimaIistaca?

110
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:39,183
I don't...

111
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,019
So you're fucked up, cabron!

112
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,717
Beauty!

113
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,736
Here comes fresh meat!

114
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,576
So? What's your name?

115
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,071
Get out, fuckin' faggot!

116
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,151
So we got a macho here!

117
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,990
He doesn't even imagine

118
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,786
We'II put him on a dish here.

119
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,673
Stop it!

120
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,846
Thanks...

121
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,550
Look, man, I'II take care of you.

122
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,795
But aII I'II ask from you

123
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,857
is to caII me...

124
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:28,792
Mireya.

125
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,409
Grandma, what is dad doing in BrasiI?

126
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,851
Nothing, dear, he got a job there.

127
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,520
When is he coming back?

128
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,420
Soon, dear, soon...

129
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,130
You're acting strange.

130
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,399
Are you sad?

131
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,906
You're bored! We can pIay something,

132
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:11,377
I have checkers, chess, or Chinese
checkers...

133
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,675
No, man, I don't want to pIay anything.

134
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,406
I toId you to caII me Mireya.

135
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,609
No, Mireya...

136
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,045
Thank you.

137
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,224
If you're depressed,

138
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,883
I better go and take a sun bath.

139
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,124
Let's go to the beach, oh, oh, oh...

140
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:36,302
Let's go to the beach, oh, oh, oh...

141
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,238
Let's go to AcapuIco, oh, oh, oh...

142
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,854

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,328

144

Pendejo, Iet's go!

150
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,789
Don't you ever Ieave me aIone again.

151
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,393
Did you get a girIfriend in BrasiI?

152
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,362
I didn't.

153
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:43,826
How come?

154
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,831
BrasiI's fuII of women!

155
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,000
Looks Iike I wasn't Iucky.

156
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,410
C'mon, teII me about it.

157
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,210
I've nothing to teII you.

158
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,480
You know what I dreamed Iast night?

159
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,350
What?

160
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,386

You better sIeep now..

00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,756
I have a drawing for you.

163
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,934
How nice!

164
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,241
Why did you draw an airpIane?

165
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,175
Because we're moving to Viña deI Mar.

166
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,808
Who's moving?

167
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,276
You and the boy.

168
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,339
I found your dad.
He is Iiving in Viña deI Mar,

169
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,078
he bought your air tickets...

170
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,583
and got a job for you...

171
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,392
But, mom, I bareIy know him,
I haven't seen him

172
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,694
for thirty years!

173
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,161
WeII, that makes it a good
reason for you to go.

174
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,597
I have a right to get a Iife too, haven't I?

175
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,435
And there's something I want to teII you,

176
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,466
I'm seeing someone.

177
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,643
But, mom...

178
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,372
So you'II go to ChiIe!

179
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,746
Come here, honey...

180
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,481

181
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,884
You'II see the Andes and dance cueca.

182
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,703
You dropped this.

183
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,867
Thank you!

184
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,610
Are you traveIing aIone?

185
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,610
With my dad.

186
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,013
ReaIIy? Where are you going?

187
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,918
To Viña deI Mar,
we're getting down in Santiago.

188
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,722
What's your name?

189
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:44,751
Pedro. And yours?

190
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,859
I'm LiIiana. Nice to meet you, Pedro.

191
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,589
Nice to...

192
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,091
What are you staring at?

193
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,529
Are they reaI?

194
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,661
Of course they are!

195
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,808
Hey, you're hot!

196
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:07,642
You too.

197
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,006
Thank you.

198
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,342
Bye!

199
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,852
Men, they're aII the same.

200
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,558
Where were you?

201
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,126
The pIane takes off in haIf an hour!

202
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,423
CooI it!

203
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,154
You're nervous, aren't you?

204
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,569
Listen, it must be weird
not to know your father.

205
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,442
I wonder how grandpa is.

206
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,259
I'm aImost dead!

207
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,488
You haven't seen him for how Iong?

208
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,994
Longer than thirty years.

209
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,035
Are you nervous?

210
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,200
Yes

211
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,509
How wiII you recognize him?

212
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,373
A father is aIways a father.

213
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,544
If you want, we can pretend we're friends.

214
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,078
Are you crazy?

215
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,017
We are what we are.

216
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,664
If he has your eyes, it'II be easy

217
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,227
You, siIIy...

218
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,045
We must take it to the garage,

219
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,147
it never starts immediateIy.

220
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,683
Okay, bye!

221
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,950
So? Did you Iike the fIight?

222
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,057
I did, but it was too short!

223
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,660
How oId are you?

224
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,791
Hey! Never ask that to a woman!

225
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,928
Hasn't your mom toId you?

226
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,736
No. Maybe because she died.

227
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,335
I'm sorry...

228
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,208
Why are you sorry? You didn't know her.

229
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,075
Because, I'm sad a boy Iike you

230
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,043
is not with his mother.

231
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,849
Are you married?

232
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,819
I'm singIe.

233
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,888
If I were oId,
I wouId ask you out right now.

234
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,154
WouId you?

235
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,825
I'II have to wait some years then.

236
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,430
I'II caII you.

237
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,462
Bye...

238
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:22,939
What?

239
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,303
When I'm with you,
things happen to me.

240
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,808
WeII, I gotta go now. Bye!

241
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,629
Long time no see...

242
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,930
I'm so gIad you're here!

243
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,231
-Let's go!

244
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,493
-I was waiting for you...

245
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,731
Check out, dad, those are gays!

246
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,097
No, they're not. They're Russians.

247
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,206
It's a tradition for them to kiss,

248
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,979
Even twice, Iike Eskimos,
who greet Iike this...

249
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,580
Those eyes are just Iike grandpa's.

250
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,891
You must be Pedro, my grandson.

251
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,029
Nice to see you!

252
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,135
CharIy...

253
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,569
Nice to see you.

254
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:15,879
A friend of mine...

255
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,288
HeIIo...

256
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,925
From the house...

257
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,681
Don't you touch anything...

258
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,291
That's a Pre CoIombian pottery,

259
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,826
from the Chimu cuIture.

260
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,393
It's the God of FertiIity.

261
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,565
Your father Ioves coIIecting things.

262
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,409
Pedro, come with me, I want to show you

263
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,842
the joys in the house.

264
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,485
Where do you Iive, FIavio?

265
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,727
We're sharing the house
whiIe we prepare a pIay.

266
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,728
Your father is a great director.

267
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,732
Theaters in Limache
and QuiIIota were fiIIed.

268
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,528
This is a Mayan hat.

269
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,540
It's neither Mayan nor a hat.

270
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,609
It's a Sombrero charro from JaIisco.

271
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,042
1 ,500 years after.

272
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,645
Modern art...

273
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,117
ConceptuaI...

274
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,656
This house is so weird.

275
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,493
Weird?

276
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,100
The former owner was a faggot...

277
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,433
super faggot...

278
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,038
See how he decorated it.

279
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,382
We bought it with everything inside.

280
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,315
To the same one you bought the car to...

281
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,479
Right!

282
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,324
I mean, yes...

283
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,154
CharIy, I just can't,
I don't know how to teII you this...

284
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,101
I hope you're not offended...

285
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,908
I'm gay and proud of it.

286
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,473
WeII, it's written aII over your face.

287
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,510
I'm your father's partner...

288
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,178
If you're a Ieftist you
can caII me his compañero...

289
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,730
Wait, you mean my father is...

290
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,232
homosexuaI?

291
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,505
No, weII yes...

292
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,631
Kind of, a IittIe...

293
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,875
AII I know is I'm his partner.

294
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,509
You have a wonderfuI kid.

295
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,782
Mary and I have two;
VaIentina and Tweety.

296
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,223
They are the joy in the house...

297
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,632
That's how they do...

298
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,741
What's his name?

299
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,484
This boy's caIIed Tweety.

300
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,881
That's how FIavio baptized him.

301
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,353
To me he's Pavarotti.

302
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,554
So he's caIIed Tweety Pavarotti.

303
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,958
He sings Iike the Gods.

304
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,832
What's that noise?

305
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,532
It's grandpa, grandpa and his friend

306
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,967
are doing yoga.

307
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,742
Okay, put on these cottons...

308
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,536
Yoga?

309
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,874
Yoga...

310
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,253
It's something from the HimaIayas...

311
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,187
Breathing exercises to open pores...

312
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,959
Why do they sIeep together?

313
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,861
They're working on a Greek pIay...

314
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,960
Oedipus. Oedipus in America...

315
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,837
You see?

316
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,309
Is grandpa an actor?

317
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:18,309
Grandpa is... many things.

318
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,585
AIright, put on the cottons

319
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,313

320
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,543
I wanted so much to meet you.

321
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,142
Grandpa?

322
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,578
Yes?

323
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,608
Do you have chocoIate miIk?

324
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,052
You have everything here, honey.

325
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:03,989
ChocoIate, strawberry miIk,
MeIon, orange juice.

326
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,291

I faiIed!

328
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,514
Breakfast's ready!

329
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,149
Sit over there...

330
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,126
Did you sIeep weII?

331
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:35,785
I didn't!

332
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,829
How moody!

333
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,320
Just Iike me in the mornings...

334
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,599
I'm unbearabIe!

335
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,835
What time did you stop
doing yoga Iast night?

336
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,736
Yoga?

337
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,973
I toId Pedro you guys do yoga at nights,

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,382
that's why the noise and aII...

339

The mantra!

340
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,574
Right, the mantra!

341
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,145
I toId you not to be that Ioud.

342
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,289
You sounded Iike a broken mariachi...

343
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,584
So now I must keep
it Iow in my own house!

344
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,323
Don't take it that way...

345
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,491
How is the pIay doing?

346
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,395
PIay?

347
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:18,700

00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,632
that's why you Iive together
and dress that way.

349
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,806
Sure! The one we're rehearsing...

350
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,636
When is the opening?

351
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,136

354
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,213
Or however it Iasts...

355
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,958
Try that one, it's reaIIy good.

356
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,427
-It's so good!

357
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,359

More berries?

364
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,421
Mexico is amazing.

365
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,495

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,756

367
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,295
Not to mention ChipoIite

368
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,400
-ChipoIite?

369
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,765
-A wonderfuI nude beach!

370
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,104
Was that the jaiI's name?

371
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,066
CharIy, we aII heard about it.

372
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,503
You fucked up.

373
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,482
By the way, do you remember the car

374
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,575
you soId me when you Ieft to Mexico?

375
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,111
Good car, wasn't it?

376
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,444
It Iasted short though...

377
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,345
You had onIy paid two payments.

378
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,320
They took it away from me.

379
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,029
GonzaIo, Iisten, I know I fucked up,

380
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,327
I know I screwed things up,

381
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,566
But I want to change.

382
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,703
I want to start from zero.

383
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,931
And aII I need is a hand,

384
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,302
That's aII I'm asking you,
we've known each other

385
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,768
from schooI...

386
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,804
CharIy, these records make it impossibIe.

387
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,642
You know my business
depends on prestige.

388
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,979
If I recommend you and you fuck me up,

389
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,182
what do I do with my girIs?

390
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,483
Look at them, prettier everyday,
just Iike their mother...

391
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,955
GonzaIo, I need your heIp.

392
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,792
You know I'm a widower, I have a kid

393
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,893
and I need to work.

394
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,531
With these records, not onIy me,

395
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,302
but no one wiII hire you...

396
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,949
Look!

397
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,023
Did you see the seaguIIs?

398
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,960
Did you know seaguIIs are one of the...

399
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,357
Listen, I couIdn't care Iess,

400
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,323
this is not funny.

401
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,761
It's not normaI to have
a homosexuaI father.

402
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,800
It's not normaI to have a con son either.

403
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,406
That's different, I'm not a pervert.

404
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,271
And I'm not a criminaI.

405
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,546
You know, I think this won't work,

406
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,012
I better take Pedro and Ieave.

407
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,650
Did you teII him I got a job for him?

408
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,020
I toId him about the seaguIIs
and he got mad.

409
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,355
Imagine if I spoke about a job...

410
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,324
Did you teII him he can earn

411
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,087
300 thousand pesos per weekend?

412
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,331
Nice seaguIIs!

413
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,732
Grandpa and FIavio are so nice.

414
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,476
Do you Iike them?

415
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,034
Yeah, a Iot!

416
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,507
WiII we have our own house?

417
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,044
In a near future...

418
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,086
WiII we have a dog?

419
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,621
Sure! Of course we'II have a dog,

420
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,521
and a cat and a parrot...

421
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,349
You know, dad?
I speak with mom every night.

422
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,630
Oh yes? I do too.

423
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,400
What do you speak to her?

424
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,163
I teII her how you're doing, that you don't

425
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,835
brush your teeth,

426
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,806
that you Iike girIs in your schooI...

427
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:49,500
C'mon!

428
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,633
Okay, sIeep now.

429
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,901
Kiss, kiss.

430
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,577
Love you.

431
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,279
good night.

432
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,992
What are you going to do to me?

433
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,634
We have a friend who Ioves us

434
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,965
and is wiIIing to hire you.

435
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,162
Where?

436
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,766
At a gay cIub.

437
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,469
You're nuts, I don't do that kind of jobs.

438
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,547
On weekends you can make up
to 400 hundred thousand.

439
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,779
400 thousand a week?

440
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,546
Right...

441
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,845
There are gays and there are gays...

442
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,785
There's one thing though.

443
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,525
This friend of ours onIy hires gays.

444
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,689
Meaning what?

445
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,595
What you must pretend you're gay.

446
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,263
Gay, me?

447
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,035
No way!

448
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:59,268
Long week ends you
can make 450 thousand...

449
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,311
Sometimes 500 thousand...

450
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,981
HeIIo!

451
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,323
Hi', you're Iooking great...

452
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,962
Thank you, it must be the pink coIor.

453
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,102
Cut my hair, do something to me,

454
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,638
I'm depressed.

455
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,399
TeII me about JP.

456
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,174
I don't want to taIk about him.

457
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,709
C'mon, teII me.

458
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,580
Are you aIright?

459
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,879
Yes.

460
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,843
Do you want a tea or a coffee?

461
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,289
No, thanks...

462
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,449
You're thirsty.

463
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,358
I'm fine thank you.

464
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,795
Is he your boyfriend?

465
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,060
No!

466
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,629
He's CharIy, Mario's son.

467
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,559
The one who'II work at the bar.

468
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,634
Oh! Are they changing his Iook?

469
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:02,405
Yes.

470
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,408
I Iook Iike a water heater.

471
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,305
Easy, you'II be ready soon.

472
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,351
She is LiIiana, Loka's manager.

473
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:19,186
Not onIy Loka's Viña,
aII Loka's, Loka's Miami,

474
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,557
Loka's Cancún,
Loka's Punta deI Este, Loka's Rio.

475
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,025
We'II make BoIivar's dream come true.

476
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,056
We'II unify America.

477
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,199
Don't forget to pretend you're gay.

478
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,338
She's a very cIose friend of your boss,

479
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,899
And if he knows you're not gay,

480
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,307
forget about work.

481
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,808
No work, no money.

482
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,472
Right, honey.

483
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,344
WiII this be a tenuous change?

484
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,747
Very tenuous, no one wiII notice.

485
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,635
HeIIo! I'm LiIiana...

486
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:19,672
I'm CharIy...

487
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,316
I'm CharIy...

488
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,156
Are they yours?

489
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,952
Of course they're mine.

490
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,796
Are you having a change of Iook?

491
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,598
Yes, a IittIe change. When I get bored

492
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,599
I change my Iook.

493
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,193
Me too, if I get bored, I change
everything.

494
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,507
You Iook gorgeous!

495
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,856
Okay, I'm going to the gym,

496
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,291
I'II see you tonight.

497
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,657
What?
Are you Ieaving me aIone Iike this?

498
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,322
Do you want to come with me?

499
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,791
There's sauna,
piIates... It's fuII of friends there.

500
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,867
No, I better not.

501
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,499
WeII, you'II miss it.

502
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:49,771
HeIIo!

503
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,372
Do you Iike it?

504
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,749
I made this disguise

505
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,716
to work with uncIe FIavio.

506
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,816
What are you disguised of?

507
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,912
Russian. It's a Russian restaurant.

508
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,954
It's caIIed Rasputin.

509
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,960
This pIace is fuII of Russians!

510
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,898
The BerIin waII feII and this was fiIIed

511
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,796
with Russians.

512
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,468
Wow! You Iook gorgeous.

513
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,102
JuIian, he is CharIy,

514
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,709
the one I spoke to you about.

515
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:34,585
HeIIo, CharIy.

516
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,051
HeIIo.

517
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,349
Have you worked in this before?

518
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,454
Yes, in a 5 star hoteI in the north,

519
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,321
but with a Iook of a 3 star hoteI,
you know...

520
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,692
Do you know how to make drinks?

521
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,889
Do you Iike it?

522
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,396
I do.

523
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:53,792
What is your favorite drink?

524
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,338
PiscoIa.

525
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:01,534
We don't seII piscoIas here.
We seII Daikiries,

526
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,637
Campari, Negroni,

527
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,942
And the house's drink, do you know it?

528
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,186
The bIack Russian...

529
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:09,914
Good.

530
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,390
You must aIways serve
cIients with a smiIe

531
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,389
on your face and
at the music rhythm.

532
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:21,562
Because here, the cIient is aIways right.

533
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,503
Confidence is essentiaI here.

534
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,339
Important peopIe come, Iike poIiticians,

535
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,307
TV peopIe, advertisers.

536
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,806
How do you want to be caIIed?

537
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,780
Everyone here has a nickname.

538
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,675
In Loka's we're Iike a big famiIy.

539
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:42,716
Beckham?

540
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,187
I'd rather be caIIed CharIy.

541
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,125
WaIk, damned dog!

542
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,229
CooI it!

543
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,036
What you need to do is to get married.

544
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,731
Me marry?

545
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,664
Like grandpa.

546
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,468
Grandpa is not married.

547
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,109
He's married to uncIe FIavio.

548
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:08,779
What are you saying?

549
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,481
He's not married with uncIe FIavio!

550
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,110
They are a steady coupIe,
they Iove each other,

551
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,613
aIthough they're gays.

552
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,186
Gays! Gays! What is that gay thing?

553
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,291
You're so conservative, dad.

554
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,555
Stop taIking nonsense, pIease.

555
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,236
Wait for me here, I'II go get the
newspaper.

556
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,313
-See where I find you.

557
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,345
How are you?

558
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:50,943
I'm fine, with my dad.

559
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,179
We Iive in that street with my grandfather.

560
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,824
Where do you Iive?

561
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,094
I Iive in those apartments up there.

562
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:01,920
Can you see the sea?

563
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,964
Not onIy the sea, aII Viña.

564
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,530
I'II invite you one day.

565
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,471
Nice dog, hum?

566
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,406
Are you taking him to the hair dresser?

567
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:24,476
I am, why?

568
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,647
So teII us, are you mom or dad?

569
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,553
Does it hurt?

570
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,557
What did you say?

571
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,130
Does it hurt?

572
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,235
Does this hurt? Does it hurt?

573
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,074
Bye, guys, have a nice day.

574
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,564
Let's go, VaIentina.

575
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,609
HeIIo, FIavio.

576
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,346
Your probIem with the Foreign
Office is soIved.

577
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,782
I spoke with the Minister.

578
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,051
-Leave it aII to me, don't you worry.
-Thank you, don Fer.

579
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,386
-Champagne for don Fer, pIease!
No, pIease.

580
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,717
Yes, of course!

581
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,183
Sorry I'm Iate.

582
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,257
Don't worry.

583
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:21,767
HeIIo...

584
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,540
HeIIo

585
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,941
So you're the new guy.

586
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:24,498
I am.

587
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,403
Where are you from?

588
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,709
From Con Con.

589
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,982
From Con Con?

590
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,780
So you must know CheIa and Esteban?

591
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,581
I've heard of them.

592
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,855
What do you mean?

593
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,491
I was Iiving in Mexico for a Iong whiIe.

594
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,118
in GuadaIajara and Potosi.

595
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,094
Potosi! I Iove Potosi.

596
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,890
I aIso Iived in Mexico.

597
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:51,900
I went there with three friends,
Bighead, the Greek and Mireya.

598
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,403
Mireya was my best friend.

599
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,405
But I got bored and came back.

600
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,241
Did you?

601
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,038
Yes. I don't know I...

602
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,378
I missed my mom.

603
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,583
One gets so homesick abroad.

604
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,175
Right.

605
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,585
Do you know what you wiII dance?

606
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,186
Where?

607
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,954
Here! AII of us must do a show here.

608
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,954
The thing is I'm a IittIe stiff.

609
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,894
I Iove stiff guys!

610
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,928
I know what you can do...

611
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:31,065
You can do a show caIIed
"Adam and Eve??

612
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,235
And I wouId be your snake...

613
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,222
Did you coIIect those invoices?

614
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,122
No, they asked for 30 more days.

615
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:51,996
No way. We're 50% Iower than Loka's
Cancun,

616
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:55,727
30% Iower than Loka's Miami,
we're fucked up.

617
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,130
CoIIect the invoices.

618
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:01,601
But these invoices are from winter, and...

619
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,765
How is CharIy doing?

620
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:10,837
He's fine. He has a man
thing peopIe Iike very much.

621
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,317
are you knew here?

622
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,591
Yes, I'm CharIy.

623
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,660
I'm TaIaIo.

624
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,831
See you, TaIaIo.

625
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,714
ToweI!

626
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,349
I'm coming!

627
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,355
ToweI!

628
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,656
Wait! I'II give him the toweI!

629
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,597
C'mon, a toweI!

630
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,164
Ask me!

631
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:09,006
I toId you to buy toiIet paper.

632
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:13,204
I did. But you never heIp me.

633
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,146
Is it too much work
to pick it up and put it?

634
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,716
Did you see how you Ieft
the Iiving room Iast night?

635
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,684
I remind you I'm not your maid!

636
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,419
Stop fighting, you two.

637
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,887
How did you do Iast night?

638
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:28,756
He's an exceIIent waiter
and a professionaI gay.

639
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,060
-He's a naturaI!
-Son of a tigress!

640
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,061
JuIian was mad about him.

641
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,993
He's unbearabIe!

642
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,837
Next time I'II kiII him.

643
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,329
-You rather be in jaiI?
-Is that what you want?

644
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,844
-He gave you work!
-And grabbed my ass!

645
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,946
That's sexuaI harassment, honey!

646
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,039
-Don't be exaggerated!
-It is!

647
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,383
A simpIe ass grabbing is sexuaI
harassment?

648
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:57,479
It is! He just grabs anybody's ass!
Does anybody grab yours?

649
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,543
Sometimes.

650
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:03,184
Shut up, FIavio, pIease shut up.
There's no worse gay than one's mouth!

651
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,891
He just grabs my ass and that's it!

652
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,398
It's you who I Iove, honey.

653
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,163
I don't get you, honestIy I don't.

654
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,306
I Iove you when you get mad.

655
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,836
Because I'm Iike not here.

656
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,683
What is it, Dad?

657
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,742
That's how artists are.

658
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:32,049
When I was your age,
your grandpa made me act.

659
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,986
Dad, why did grandpa Ieave you
aIone if he Ioved you so much?

660
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,096
I don't know.

661
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,422
You'II never Ieave me aIone, right?

662
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,864
Never.

663
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,396
What if you die Iike mom?

664
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:52,568
Listen, I'II die when I'm very oId

665
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,104
and you're a grown up.

666
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,180
Your mom and I wiII be
waiting for you in heaven.

667
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,440
Are you sure that's how it wiII be?

668
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,845
Don't make difficuIt questions.

669
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,010
Let's go.

670
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,168
Are you his father?

671
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,940
No, I am.

672
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:33,208
I'm his grandfather.
CharIy is just coming from the north,

673
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,352
that's why I'm with him now.

674
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,649
What about the mother?

675
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:42,354
The boy's mother unfortunateIy
died from cancer...

676
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,020
AII of a sudden, she had bones cancer,
you know it's so heavy...

677
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:54,096
Anyway, the boy is pretty heaIthy.

678
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:59,202
He faced this with great wisdom...

679
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,312
He is a very mature boy...

680
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,973
Dad, pIease...

681
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:04,977
May I?

682
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:09,853
If you check Pedro's grades here
you'II see they're exceIIent.

683
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,115
Where is he?

684
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,347
He is outside.

685
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:13,588
PIaying.

686
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,031
Who is the man pIaying with him?

687
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,898
That's FIavio, an uncIe.

688
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:30,440
He is a friend of the famiIy.
Sometimes he works as our driver...

689
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,839
Just sometimes...

690
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,503
He used to be an athIete,
that's why he runs.

691
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:40,049
Don Mario, Iet's be honest here.

692
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,978
This is a smaII town in
which everything is known.

693
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,348
And what is not known is invented.

694
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:49,092
Right. I don't have a probIem at aII,
I'm very open minded,

695
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,152
I even have an uncIe Iike that.
He teIIs me everything.

696
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,465
But at schooI it can be a probIem,
because...

697
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:59,799
In parents meetings, they taIk...

698
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,530
You get it?

699
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,870
WeII, I can heIp you, but you...

700
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,603
shouId pretend a IittIe bit.

701
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,578
Wait! I'm not...

702
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,617
The uncIe, especiaIIy the uncIe.

703
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,813
But you can't deny he runs Iike a God.

704
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,295
Not so fast, Pedro!

705
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,300
The one with the Iines is from Ecuador.

706
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:44,138
He must have swam a Iot to get here.

707
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,612
KiIometers!

708
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:48,709
Grandpa...

709
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:49,774
Yes?

710
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,152
Fish Iook Iike they spoke.

711
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,325
They do speak, honey!

712
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,425
Put your ear on the gIass and you'II hear.

713
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,261
It's Iike they're singing.

714
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,231
They don't fight.

715
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,793
Because they are smart fish.

716
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,439
ToIerant fish, they respect each other.

717
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:14,637
No one is a surpIuss in an aquarium.

718
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,488
Bye, dear!

719
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,496
You got Iost!

720
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,793
Let's do it again!

721
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:38,960
One, two, get the coccyx up, man!

722
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,897
Tummy inside, coccyx up,

723
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,836
Tummy inside, coccyx up...

724
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,408
Tummy inside, coccyx up...

725
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,144
Crown...

726
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,114
Right. Now you do it.

727
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,810
Right!

728
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:01,780
Greet!

729
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,823
Hugo, Zack!

730
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,196
What about the orders I asked?

731
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,535
What do you want?

732
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,026
HeIIo! Do you have yourdriving Iicense?

733
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,101

734
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,808
Fine. I need you to go to pick up LiIiana

735
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:21,539
and bring her here immediateIy. Got it?

736
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,374
Yes! No, everything's fine!

737
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,874
The thing is...

738
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,724
Something strange happens
in this hoteI...

739
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,830
Yes, very weird...

740
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:49,534
I couIdn't get nor make caIIs,
I don't know why...

741
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,802
How couId I know why that happened?

742
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,772
I don't work here!

743
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,403
Why wouId I Iie to you?

744
00:51:58,548 --> 00:51:59,776
What?

745
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:04,384
Of course there's no one!
I don't know anybody here!

746
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,784
Who wouId I be speaking to?

747
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:16,129
No, I don't care...

748
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:19,529
I'm not getting mad!

749
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,799
Give me the bags...

750
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,840
There you go...

751
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,218
Which one?

752
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,448
This one or that one?

753
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,887
-That one.
-Great!

754
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,964
This one?

755
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:52,832
Yes!

756
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,595
Do you Iike this one?

757
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,541
This one goes without a bra.

758
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,805
Otherwise,
the Iow neck doesn't Iook nice.

759
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:00,934
Can you heIp me?

760
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,068
Right, it doesn't Iook nice.

761
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,774
It doesn't.

762
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,820
I wouId try on the red one anyway.

763
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,946
The red one?

764
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,357
Just to see...

765
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,594
I must wear V-string with the red one
And I don't feeI Iike wearing one.

766
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,858
I Iove V-strings.

767
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,522
Do you wear V-strings?

768
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,401
In summertime.
Because of the heat.

769
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:39,180
I think we're too far.

770
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,143
Turn right here.

771
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,777
Here it is!

772
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,785
Come with me.

773
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,793
-No, you go aIone.
-Why?

774
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,798
I'm aII dirty and smeIIing.

775
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:59,167
Don't worry. There is a
prompt soIution for that!

776
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,764
Nice!

777
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,731
Nice, isn't it?
Let's go!

778
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,732
No, pIease...

779
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:11,006
C'mon, I don't want to go in there aIone!

780
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:14,751
Even more, from today on,
you're my friend.

781
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,184
What do you say?

782
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,315
Okay...

783
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,223
ShaII we go?
-Okay...

784
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,425
It's good you came!

785
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,761
-BeautifuI!
-CongratuIations!

786
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,778
My ex!

787
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,214
Is he there?

788
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,658
HoId me!
HoId me!

789
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,932
-Is he stiII there?
-He is.

790
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,168
Is he stiII there?

791
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,779
What? Is he stiII there?

792
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,220
He is stiII there.

793
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,321
What is it with you?

794
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:39,392
I don't know, my pressure went down.

795
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,334
Art makes it go down.

796
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,706
AII men are stupid!

797
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,481
And cynicaI!

798
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,117
-HeIIo, JuIian.
-HeIIo, FIavio.

799
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,196
Don't you even say heIIo to me.

800
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,424
Why? What happened?

801
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:11,399
I just heard you've become
the internationaI ass grabber.

802
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,831
Mario, where did you hear that?

803
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,436
Where? C'mon don't be...

804
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,843
I Iook at you and feeI Iike
screaming to earth to swaIIow me...

805
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,640
I wouId bite you.

806
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:26,683
Listen to me well,
be macho with machos and gay with gays,

807
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:31,552
but stop fucking with me, bear that weII.

808
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,315
Mario, don't forget Iearned from you,
when I was 1 7...

809
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,829
One bIack Russian...
Two BIack Russians!

810
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,324
The bIackest you have!

811
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,524
Watch out, there's a bus coming!

812
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,010
-We had a great time, didn't we?
-Yes, we did.

813
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,777
You're great company, paI.

814
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:39,378
You're aIso great company,... paI.

815
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:46,128
I have a party at some friends'.
You wanna come?

816
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,930
No, you go aIone.
Some other time.

817
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,976
-WeII...
-Bye!

818
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,885
It smeIIs Iike faggot's perfume.

819
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:48,582
What?

820
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,124
It smeIIs Iike faggot's perfume!
Those asshoIes are bad Iuck!

821
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,319
Shut up!

822
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,627
GoaI!!!

823
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,260
Right!

824
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,433
I toId you there was a faggot!

825
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,071
Faggots bring bad Iuck, man!

826
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,859
There's your hat, you queer!

827
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,734
Get out of here, you fucking faggot!

828
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:35,703
<i>Little by little l?m getting over you</i>

829
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:46,381
<i>Little by little l feel you
so far from my soul...</i>

830
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:50,442
<i>...that l don?t love you anymore</i>

831
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:58,855
<i>All l do is forget you</i>

832
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,901

<i>lf l forget you...</i>

835
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:29,521
Forgive me, I didn't mean to offend you.

836
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,120
It's aIways the same thing,

837
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,593
It's so easy to ask for forgiveness.

838
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,932
What do you know about the bIues?
Nothing.

839
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,643
Is it too hard for you to say I Iove you?

840
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,874
Once a month, that's aII.
Is it too much to ask?

841
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,044
No...

842
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,749
I'm mad about you!

843
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,151
CharIy!

844
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:06,319
I'm sorry...

845
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,794
What happened to you?

846
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,638
Let me see that...

847
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:16,935
I'm fine...

848
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,107
I know first aid...

849
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,837
FIavio, honestIy, I'm fine.
Thank you, I'm fine, thank you...

850
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,011
Let me see this.

851
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,450
Have this.
It wiII heIp the pain go away.

852
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,759
-Where were you?
-Somewhere around.

853
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,190
Cowards!

854
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,162
I had a fight once too.

855
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:49,496
Somebody screamed "faggot??
and I went mad against three...

856
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,034
They bIew out these three teeth.

857
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:56,837
I didn't care, they were decayed and
I was going to take them out anyway.

858
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,807
Can I ask you something?

859
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,744
When did you start being...

860
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,788
Like this?

861
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,426
Like what?

862
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:19,832
This faggot? This queer? This whore?

863
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:23,802
What was first?

864
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,438
The hen or the egg?

865
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,875
No one knows...

866
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,350
Nature is capricious.

867
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,775
I was born Iike this.

868
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:44,390
Imagine your father
running on the fieIds,

869
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,085
hoIding the baII tight.

870
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:52,896
I enjoyed watching my mates
running after me.

871
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,316
What I Iiked the most

872
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,319
was the moment we aII went to the
showers.

873
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:20,318
Big Head Perez, he was so gorgeous!

874
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,456
And then...

875
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,867
I married your mother.

876
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:35,572
A pious, terribIe and toxic Iady.

877
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,850
<b>But she was what I needed,
'cause she toId me</b>

878
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,420
sex was onIy to procreate.

879
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:48,186
This is my chance, I said!
And you were born.

880
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:53,062
Then, your aunt EIoina,
that fuckin' oId whore,

881
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:56,429
started teIIing her things,

882
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:00,636
Iike women had to be a Iady in the house

883
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,238
and a whore in bed.

884
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,968
So your mother became demanding,

885
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,505
and I just couIdn't!

886
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,973
I ran away Iike a queer.

887
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,943
My father-in-Iaw threatened me to kiII me

888
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,442
wherever he found me.

889
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,718
To have defamed his famiIy.

890
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,951
Fuckin' oId man.

891
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,360
Have your drink.

892
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:29,361
I don't want.

893
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:30,733
It'II do you good...

894
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:31,358
Dad, I don't want.

895
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:32,368
It wiII...

896
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,528
Stop it, Dad!

897
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,405
You caIIed me dad.

898
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,505
First time you caII me dad.

899
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,591
I've toId you a thousand times
to put the toiIet seat up.

900
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,892
You don't Iive aIone.

901
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,637
And that bad habit of yours of Ieaving

902
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:11,198
wet toweIs on the bed makes me so mad!

903
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,745
CoupIe's fight!

904
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,803
We better Ieave!

905
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,507
What about the Iiving room
the night before?

906
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,577
I'm not your maid.

907
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:26,055
I know you aren't,
but the house must be neat.

908
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,857
I didn't Ieave the wet toweIs on the bed...

909
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:28,791
Who was it then?

910
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:29,450
I don't know.

911
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,023
It must have been Superman!

912
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,018
Let's find out who was it...

913
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,761
Ask your son.

914
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,857
Are you guys married?

915
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:16,603
No! Dear God does not want us to.
And I'm so reIigious!

916
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,606
How did you guys meet?

917
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,370
That was so Iong ago!

918
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:27,350
Like 15 years ago.
I was in QuiIIota finishing my second pIay.

919
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,215
Narcissus and GoImundo.

920
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:30,983
He was Narcissus.

921
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:36,559
I remember he came aII seIf confident,

922
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,222
Iooked at me straight in
theeyes and said "I am Narcissus??.

923
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,329
And I fainted.

924
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,458
He hired me.

925
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,092
How did the pIay do?

926
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:53,073
The pIay did terribIe,
because we had a fight on the opening day.

927
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,545
I had a fight with some journaIists.

928
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,615
I don't Iike being criticized
for what I do in bed,

929
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,751
but for what I do on stage.

930
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,015
I toId them on their faces.

931
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:10,556
Grandpa...

932
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:12,555
UncIe FIavio...

933
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,293
Let's go and buy an ice cream?

934
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,826
Whatever you want, dear.

935
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,683
Kiss them for me. Bye.

936
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,190
GonzaIo!

937
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,861
CharIy! What are you doing here?

938
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,334
What are you doing here?

939
01:07:55,938 --> 01:08:01,968
Me? I'm with a German cIient who asked
me to take him to an aIternative pIace.

940
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:08,378
Do you work here?

941
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,280
I do.

942
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,747
So you are one of us.

943
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,054
I'm not.

944
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,291
Rodrigo is in the bathroom.

945
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:23,089
C'mon, don't be Iike this.
It was hard for me to face it too.

946
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,701
Can you imagine fat
so knowing about it?

947
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,370
My wife, the girIs, peopIe at my work?

948
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,065
I'd be fucked up!

949
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,435
So we're partners here!

950
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,016
OnIy ten minutes Ieft!

951
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,715
Get it, Mario pIease.

952
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:47,686
You get it.

953
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:50,593
I aIways get it, I'm watching the game.

954
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,229
Why can't you get it?
They aIways caII you!

955
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,789
For the same reason you can't.
It's for you.

956
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,728
I wiII get it.

957
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,227
What did you do?

958
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,495
You put it in pause!

959
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,805
Can you teII us what button you pressed?

960
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,275
It was wrong number.

961
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,072
What did you do?

962
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,017
Look. You can forward, rewind

963
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:18,145
You guys are too oId.

964
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:22,020
Right. We're oId and it's bed time.

965
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:23,883
Go to bed.

966
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,653
Bye.

967
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,460
Good night.

968
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,193
OId man...

969
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:34,136
Men don't Iike reaI women.

970
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:36,038
They're afraid of us. That is so true.

971
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:42,034
Being a reaI,
I mean a reaI woman is a probIem...

972
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,338
How have you been?

973
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,510
Fine.

974
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:55,181
CharIy at your service.

975
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,793
Too bad not at our service.

976
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,089
Excuse me.

977
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,822
Go on, CharIy.

978
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:09,729
Why didn't you come to work?

979
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,838
I was mugged, I couIdn't.

980
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:16,412
Listen, not because you're going out

981
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,744
with the boss you can do
whatever you want.

982
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,576
You guys are together, right?

983
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,551
I don't know. Ask her.

984
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,847
What did you say?

985
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,052
Let me remind you I'm the boss here.

986
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:34,730
If you want to keep working,
you must do everything I teII you to.

987
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,630
Do that to me once again

988
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,597
and I'II smash your face.

989
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:45,099
Fuckin' asshoIe!

990
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,526
Don JuIian...

991
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:13,234
Do you know that guy over there?

992
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:17,740
I think I know him from somewhere

993
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,767
and I've been thinking, trying to
remember,

994
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:27,149
and I did.
I met him in Mexico sometime ago.

995
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:31,984
But he's changed.
He is not what he seems.

996
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:38,060
I heard he was in money,
checks, stoIen cars troubIes,

997
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,493
you know...

998
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,389
Are you sure it's him?

999
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,094
As sure as my name is Mireya.

1000
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,368
I want to ask you something.

1001
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,044
Look at me when I'm taIking to you.

1002
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:58,441
I'm watching the game.

1003
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:03,577
You aIways have an excuse
not to pay attention to me.

1004
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,413
We are Iosing communication.

1005
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,515
Look...

1006
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:15,986
Suppose that I die.

1007
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,801
WouId you have a coupIe again?

1008
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,325
No way!

1009
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,937
You wouIdn't?

1010
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,133
That means you haven't
Iiked Ieaving as a coupIe.

1011
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,378
If you don't get married or
engaged with someone eIse

1012
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:32,047
it's because you didn´t Iike being married.

1013
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,215
I never said that.

1014
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:36,018
You didn't say it, but it's what you mean.

1015
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:36,882
No, caIm down.

1016
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,721
I'm not that fooI.

1017
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:42,418
Okay, I wouId re marry.

1018
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,458
You wouId?

1019
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,164
WouId you bring him to Iive here?

1020
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,460
Of course, this is our house.

1021
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,070
WouId you sIeep with him in our
bedroom?

1022
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,398
That's what bedrooms are for, to sIeep.

1023
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,137
On our bed?

1024
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,515
Yes. I might change
the mattress and the bed sheets,

1025
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,039
but yes, on the same bed.

1026
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:09,380
You wouId?

1027
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:12,449
-Go to heII!
-I was joking!

1028
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:13,355
You weren't!

1029
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:16,051
You're the onIy one who
can make jokes here?

1030
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:25,589
I get aIong so weII with you guys.

1031
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:27,733
Come here.

1032
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:34,899
TeII me. Do you have a coupIe?

1033
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,444
One who died.

1034
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,405
From what? Aids?

1035
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:44,851
From cancer, but prostate cancer.

1036
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:49,251
-You must have suffered a Iot.
-I did...

1037
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,870
Come here, teII me...

1038
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:08,142
Have you ever made Iove with a woman?

1039
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,136
No, never.

1040
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,905
I haven't been with a gay neither.

1041
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,841
Do you know what Iove is?

1042
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,856
Love is...

1043
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:30,599
Is something Iike Iosing fear,
fear of knowing the other

1044
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:33,329
and of the other knowing you.

1045
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:34,867
You get it...

1046
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:36,536
I do...

1047
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:41,706
I think I'm aIready afraid.

1048
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,972
Are you afraid of me?

1049
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,745
A IittIe.

1050
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,380
Let's pIay something.

1051
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:55,519
Let's suppose I'm a friend of yours.

1052
01:14:57,025 --> 01:15:03,021
So you just cIose your eyes
and Iet your body taIk...

1053
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,523
I'II Iet myseIf fIow.

1054
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,559
Perfect...

1055
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:37,128
How dirty! I think I'm feeIing things.

1056
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,864
Let's see...

1057
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,703
Gross!

1058
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,661
What a headache!

1059
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:26,106
You know what I dreamed Iast night?

1060
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,582
I dreamed I had an accident and died.

1061
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:36,318
Stop dreaming nonsense, pIease!

1062
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,328
FIyman!

1063
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:48,968
Pedro, check this one out.

1064
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,032
I pIanted this one two years ago.

1065
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:55,174
For an anniversary with FIavio.

1066
01:16:56,411 --> 01:17:00,006
You must aIways take
out the ones drying,

1067
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,983
otherwise they die.

1068
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:05,451
I'II fiII this with fIowers of different coIors,

1069
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,283
Iike an aquareIIe.

1070
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,658
See how I make your dad work.

1071
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,726
So? How do you Iike it?

1072
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:22,604
Homophobic Band Sets
Gay Disco on Fire.

1073
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,037
What do you think?

1074
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,797
What is a homophobic?

1075
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,705
Ask your dad.

1076
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:32,139
What is a homophobic?

1077
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:37,152
A Homophobic is someone
who has a phobia,

1078
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:40,315
some are spider phobic,
others are gay phobic.

1079
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,317
Like yourseIf.

1080
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:45,157
You got me wrong.

1081
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:48,329
What I toId you is gays

1082
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,767
shouId not be congratuIated,
but respected.

1083
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:52,791
That's aII.

1084
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:03,839
Yes?

1085
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,978
CharIy, something serious happened

1086
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:11,281
and I'd Iike to cIear it up.

1087
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:13,952
I don't get it.

1088
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,482
Money was Iost.

1089
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:21,090
600 thousand pesos were Iost
and we think it was you.

1090
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,059
I'm sure it was you.

1091
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:25,965
Me?

1092
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,302
CharIy, where did you work in the north?

1093
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,206
This is a joke, isn't it?

1094
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,875
No. The joke is you were
in jaiI for being a conman.

1095
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:37,840
That's the joke.

1096
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:42,650
No, there's a mistake here, LiIiana.

1097
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,845
Are these records a mistake?

1098
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,681
CharIy don't pretend this is not you.

1099
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,092
We're not stupid.

1100
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,458
CharIy, wiII you say it or shaII I?

1101
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,670
You're not even one of us!

1102
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,262
That's a disguise!

1103
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:06,501
He's not even gay.
He's a Iiar and a thief.

1104
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,909
I didn't take that money, LiIiana.

1105
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:11,871
Fire him.

1106
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,745
I didn't do it.

1107
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:47,882
He did!

1108
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:52,012
What did I teII you when you arrived?

1109
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,991
I'm teIIing you I didn't steaI that money!

1110
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:57,754
Everyone knew he's not gay.

1111
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,795
And he seduced LiIiana,
which put me as a Iiar.

1112
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:06,968
I'm not kicking you out of
here because of my grandson,

1113
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,137
I swear to you.

1114
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:10,968
You're not kicking me out.

1115
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,739
<b>I'm Ieaving 'cause I'm fed up
of gays and homos, fed up!</b>

1116
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:23,311

But listen to me well, Pedro has a family,</i>

1117
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:26,148

Last time I cried Iike this

was when Lady Di died...

1132
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,344

1133
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,886

-Sure, baby!

1154
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:10,734
You see how you're spoiIed again?

1155
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,841

The green Iemon.

1160
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:18,977
The green Iemon.
