1
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.158
Don't know how many times.

2
00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.712
I've been crossed off the
list and left for dead.

3
00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:22.758
Guess when it first happens
the day you were born,

4
00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:25.511
you're gonna lose count.

5
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:31.809
So this,

6
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.104
this ain't nothing new.

7
00:10:54.613 --> 00:10:56.874
There are bad days,

8
00:10:58.451 --> 00:11:01.587
and then there are
legendary bad days.

9
00:11:03.414 --> 00:11:06.425
Whole damn planet
wanted a piece of me.

10
00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.890
Can't stay in the open.

11
00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:16.518
Can't risk another attack.

12
00:11:36.447 --> 00:11:40.584
It's always the punch you don't
see coming that puts you down.

13
00:11:43.788 --> 00:11:45.923
But why didn't I see it?

14
00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:48.676
But why didn't I see it?

15
00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:54.464
Of course they were
gonna try to kill me.

16
00:11:54.465 --> 00:11:57.267
Death is what they
do for a living.

17
00:12:02.473 --> 00:12:05.025
So the question ain't
what happened?

18
00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:07.403
The question is.

19
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.448
What happened to me?

20
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.802
You are the Lord Marshal now.

21
00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:35.389
How did they get so close?

22
00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:42.229
How did I let them
blindside me like that?

23
00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:45.816
Threshold. Take us
to the threshold.

24
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.402
Necromongers.

25
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.947
Some wanted to put a
crown on my head.

26
00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:56.952
Some wanted to put a
noose around my neck.

27
00:12:59.655 --> 00:13:02.374
Okay, more nooses than crowns.

28
00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:07.629
I needed a way out.

29
00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:11.592
Some new place.

30
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.639
Or maybe just an old one.

31
00:13:21.594 --> 00:13:24.855
But how do you find something
you've never seen?

32
00:13:26.724 --> 00:13:29.985
Please, come back to bed.

33
00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:04.478
Sometimes I think you never
sleep, Lord Marshal.

34
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.525
How can I sleep when
I have so many...

35
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.527
Distractions?

36
00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:17.324
So what is the best
way to a man's heart?

37
00:14:18.776 --> 00:14:21.120
Between the fourth and fifth rib.

38
00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:24.331
That's where I usually go.

39
00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:29.378
I'll put a twist at the
end if I wanna make sure.

40
00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:33.747
They'll never let you
stand at the threshold

41
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:36.177
of Underverse without
embracing the faith.

42
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.764
That's why they come after
you, these assassins.

43
00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:44.268
They think of you
as something wrong.

44
00:14:44.427 --> 00:14:47.980
Cursed. Illegitimate.

45
00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:53.068
What are you gonna do when
you're born that way?

46
00:14:57.148 --> 00:14:58.449
Did you hear?

47
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:02.786
Do you think the guards
are still there?

48
00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:15.716
Lord Marshal.

49
00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:20.179
Something like that?

50
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:36.111
I said between the
fourth and fifth.

51
00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:41.909
Fifth and sixth? Body cavity.

52
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:05.724
Making more friends, I see.

53
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.227
But who put her up to it?

54
00:16:09.053 --> 00:16:10.980
Which commander?

55
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.024
It could be any of many.

56
00:16:15.685 --> 00:16:17.695
Don't doubt it for a second,

57
00:16:19.063 --> 00:16:20.572
Commander Vaako.

58
00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:23.784
Lord Marshal.

59
00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.753
They say you lost
your nerve, Vaako,

60
00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:39.049
after that big swing and a miss.

61
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.012
Is that what they say?

62
00:16:46.298 --> 00:16:49.184
Now what are you gonna do
to get that cred back?

63
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.563
What's the big play?

64
00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:56.233
Something splashy.

65
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.072
Actually,

66
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.826
I had in mind something different.

67
00:17:13.284 --> 00:17:16.920
I've been thinking about
an early campaign.

68
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.008
My very first. I was but a boy.

69
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:25.471
We dropped from the sky and
did what Necromongers do.

70
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.310
Destruction was breathtaking.

71
00:17:33.596 --> 00:17:35.689
But then we met resistance.

72
00:17:37.016 --> 00:17:39.818
Ferocious like a storm of lions.

73
00:17:42.438 --> 00:17:45.741
Each one of them killed
over a hundred Necro

74
00:17:46.275 --> 00:17:48.369
before their weapons failed.

75
00:17:50.946 --> 00:17:53.457
And then they killed
another 30 more.

76
00:17:54.075 --> 00:17:55.626
Barehanded.

77
00:17:57.828 --> 00:18:00.872
Our firepower and
strength in numbers

78
00:18:00.873 --> 00:18:02.967
eventually won us the day.

79
00:18:04.085 --> 00:18:08.305
I can still see him, the last
of those magnificent warriors,

80
00:18:08.506 --> 00:18:10.724
standing on a pile of his own.

81
00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:14.979
And he looked at me.

82
00:18:18.182 --> 00:18:21.527
And I will never
forget those eyes.

83
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:32.162
His eyes were just like yours.

84
00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:39.795
The planet was Furya.

85
00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:42.840
I know what it's called.

86
00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:45.676
You just don't know where it is.

87
00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:48.420
I need charts. I need maps.

88
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:50.255
- Impossible.
- I need a direction.

89
00:18:50.256 --> 00:18:52.507
Purged from all records,
as you well know.

90
00:18:52.508 --> 00:18:54.476
But you remember where.

91
00:18:57.972 --> 00:18:59.648
So many worlds...

92
00:19:01.392 --> 00:19:04.236
The only map left in existence

93
00:19:04.729 --> 00:19:08.991
is the one that's in
my head, Riddick.

94
00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:16.874
So what do you want?

95
00:19:17.908 --> 00:19:19.710
The crown?

96
00:19:24.373 --> 00:19:26.467
Transcendence.

97
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:31.722
Krone.

98
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:34.600
Break off a ship.

99
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:37.978
Riddick's going home.

100
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.899
Transcendence.

101
00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:45.530
I guess that was Necro
speak for "Get the

102
00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:48.238
fuck off our ship and
make it forever."

103
00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:50.699
Fine by me.

104
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:58.248
You can't blame him
for dangling Furya.

105
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.585
Home has a certain equity.

106
00:20:04.497 --> 00:20:08.592
But I do blame him
for what came next.

107
00:20:23.265 --> 00:20:25.693
It's a long way to come.

108
00:20:26.227 --> 00:20:27.861
For this.

109
00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:32.616
This guy with the
fucked-up face, Krone,

110
00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:36.078
he was supposed to
be our ride home.

111
00:20:37.863 --> 00:20:43.127
But instead of Furya, we
wind up some place called...

112
00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:45.963
Not Furya.

113
00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:58.225
Yet again, someone was
trying to play me.

114
00:21:00.428 --> 00:21:02.146
So yet again,

115
00:21:04.348 --> 00:21:06.400
we play for blood.

116
00:22:38.234 --> 00:22:41.245
You keep what you kill, Riddick.

117
00:22:41.862 --> 00:22:44.248
You keep what you kill.

118
00:22:49.704 --> 00:22:52.965
Somewhere along the
way, I lost a step.

119
00:22:53.332 --> 00:22:55.426
I got sloppy.

120
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.845
Dulled my own edge.

121
00:22:59.505 --> 00:23:02.933
Maybe I went and did the
worst crime of all...

122
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.603
I got civilised.

123
00:23:13.144 --> 00:23:16.280
So now we zero the clock.

124
00:23:17.857 --> 00:23:21.493
Just me and this no-name world.

125
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.957
Gotta find that animal side again.

126
00:25:02.837 --> 00:25:08.309
Before long, I realised there was
a whole other world over there,

127
00:25:09.135 --> 00:25:12.479
of water, grass and life.

128
00:25:14.432 --> 00:25:17.568
Just had one thing in my way.

129
00:26:31.092 --> 00:26:32.434
Hey.

130
00:29:17.675 --> 00:29:20.144
Come on, show me some teeth.

131
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.302
Escape artist, huh?

132
00:33:18.374 --> 00:33:20.801
What you got over there?

133
00:33:32.138 --> 00:33:34.106
Thought we shared everything.

134
00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.048
Drop it.

135
00:34:57.264 --> 00:34:58.899
Stay.

136
00:35:34.343 --> 00:35:36.020
Bounty hunters.

137
00:35:51.235 --> 00:35:52.786
Wait.

138
00:35:54.238 --> 00:35:55.873
Wait...

139
00:35:56.365 --> 00:35:57.916
Steady...

140
00:35:58.743 --> 00:36:00.377
Okay, now.

141
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:07.426
Sounds good.

142
00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:21.565
All yours.

143
00:36:27.438 --> 00:36:29.907
It says dog food on it.

144
00:36:30.649 --> 00:36:32.451
If you could read.

145
00:36:37.823 --> 00:36:39.166
Come on.

146
00:36:45.122 --> 00:36:47.675
All right. Bring me my reserve.

147
00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:03.065
Where's yours?

148
00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:34.337
Rain.

149
00:37:34.338 --> 00:37:36.390
It's a good thing.

150
00:37:37.133 --> 00:37:39.048
Just because you've never seen it

151
00:37:39.049 --> 00:37:41.312
before doesn't mean
it's a bad thing.

152
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.480
Hey, easy.

153
00:37:57.987 --> 00:38:00.706
Looks like our time is up here.

154
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.035
Nothing.

155
00:40:03.029 --> 00:40:05.164
Look again, Diaz.

156
00:40:08.534 --> 00:40:11.828
Somebody should teach this
Riddick asshole how to count.

157
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:16.467
Leave one ship? Like we've got
a fucking spare laying around.

158
00:40:16.792 --> 00:40:18.677
Let's crank it up.

159
00:40:29.305 --> 00:40:31.690
Good morning, Cyclops.

160
00:40:55.373 --> 00:40:56.799
Hey, Luna.

161
00:40:59.377 --> 00:41:00.719
Yeah.

162
00:41:01.003 --> 00:41:02.680
Wake her up, kick her out of bed.

163
00:41:03.172 --> 00:41:04.932
What do you mean?

164
00:41:05.007 --> 00:41:06.892
We're running heavy.

165
00:41:06.967 --> 00:41:09.007
She's a prisoner. Wasn't she
gonna pay our way back?

166
00:41:09.027 --> 00:41:10.646
We're going big now.

167
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:14.274
Okay? Cut that 60 kilos loose.

168
00:41:30.491 --> 00:41:32.117
Get away. Get away from me.

169
00:41:32.118 --> 00:41:33.660
Stop, just stop.

170
00:41:33.661 --> 00:41:35.412
What do you want now?

171
00:41:35.413 --> 00:41:38.424
I'm gonna take off the
restraints. Okay?

172
00:41:40.001 --> 00:41:41.292
I don't want them off.

173
00:41:41.293 --> 00:41:42.678
No, it's not like that.

174
00:41:43.379 --> 00:41:45.389
Nobody is gonna touch you now.

175
00:41:45.464 --> 00:41:47.599
Santana's head is
into other stuff now.

176
00:41:48.843 --> 00:41:50.728
Your lucky day.

177
00:41:57.226 --> 00:41:58.685
Get the fuck away from me.

178
00:41:58.686 --> 00:42:00.321
Okay.

179
00:42:01.147 --> 00:42:03.231
What planet is this? Where are we?

180
00:42:03.232 --> 00:42:05.352
It's got air and water. That's
all you've got to know.

181
00:42:09.864 --> 00:42:11.528
But how am I supposed
to survive...

182
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:12.529
Just go.

183
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.960
Before he changes his mind.

184
00:42:40.561 --> 00:42:43.113
I was getting attached to her.

185
00:42:45.483 --> 00:42:47.785
Now where is my box at?

186
00:43:10.424 --> 00:43:13.769
The name is Santana.

187
00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:17.731
Shot-caller for this
crew right here.

188
00:43:18.683 --> 00:43:21.443
I am the guy who knows all,

189
00:43:21.644 --> 00:43:24.822
sees all, beats all...

190
00:43:25.648 --> 00:43:28.659
Spitting it kind of
strong, ain't he?

191
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:31.245
Got to bait the trap.

192
00:43:31.362 --> 00:43:35.949
I've come all this way to
collect your head in a box.

193
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.876
Right here.

194
00:43:39.036 --> 00:43:41.246
So have yourself a fine day now,

195
00:43:41.247 --> 00:43:43.507
Mr Richard B. Riddick.

196
00:43:44.375 --> 00:43:46.010
I suspect

197
00:43:46.877 --> 00:43:51.181
it will be one of your very last.

198
00:43:51.674 --> 00:43:54.067
Yeah, well, you don't
need to agitate

199
00:43:54.068 --> 00:43:56.145
Riddick any more than, you know.

200
00:43:57.221 --> 00:44:00.941
Any more than bringing his
head back in a box would?

201
00:44:25.958 --> 00:44:30.179
Shit. Here comes
the neighbourhood.

202
00:44:35.051 --> 00:44:36.852
Small world.

203
00:44:44.769 --> 00:44:48.897
Unidentified vessel, this is
Clan Vagos out of Ursa Five.

204
00:44:48.898 --> 00:44:51.107
Be advised that we are
on the ground now

205
00:44:51.108 --> 00:44:53.610
and have responded to
an emergency signal.

206
00:44:53.611 --> 00:44:57.414
No distress found,
no need to land.

207
00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.140
I repeat, there is
no reason for you

208
00:45:00.141 --> 00:45:02.670
to land at this
location at this time.

209
00:45:02.787 --> 00:45:04.120
Is that clear?

210
00:45:04.121 --> 00:45:08.467
No reason for you to land at
this location at this time.

211
00:45:10.795 --> 00:45:13.263
What the fuck did I just say?

212
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:32.908
It was a long haul. We
could take on some water.

213
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.787
Wouldn't mind a little
true-gravity time either.

214
00:45:36.987 --> 00:45:40.541
Like I was saying, I've got this.

215
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:50.634
You knew who that was, right?
On the emergency beacon?

216
00:45:52.712 --> 00:45:54.638
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.

217
00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:58.809
The concept of back-up still
has no appeal to you?

218
00:45:59.218 --> 00:46:02.104
My besties here can
ball with anyone.

219
00:46:02.304 --> 00:46:04.180
No disrespect for
your crew, of course,

220
00:46:04.181 --> 00:46:08.485
who look strong, too, in
those matchy-matchy outfits.

221
00:46:09.353 --> 00:46:11.947
Shit. Didn't know there
was a dress code.

222
00:46:12.189 --> 00:46:13.523
Yeah, right?

223
00:46:13.524 --> 00:46:16.952
Well, it's not my intention
to jump another man's claim.

224
00:46:17.194 --> 00:46:19.194
If you don't mind, maybe
we'll just pull up a chair

225
00:46:19.214 --> 00:46:21.224
and spectate for a while.

226
00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:23.959
What if I do?

227
00:46:24.201 --> 00:46:27.755
Well, this is a co-op station,
pal. It's open to all Mercs.

228
00:46:28.998 --> 00:46:31.708
- By the way, my name is...
- Too late.

229
00:46:31.709 --> 00:46:35.012
That's your name. Too Late.

230
00:46:35.546 --> 00:46:38.515
And I don't need you stepping all
over my dick here, my friend.

231
00:46:39.383 --> 00:46:41.518
Well, I'll tell you what.

232
00:46:42.053 --> 00:46:44.330
I won't lift a
finger to help until

233
00:46:44.331 --> 00:46:46.607
you come ask me for
it. How's that?

234
00:47:03.366 --> 00:47:05.408
I was scoping this out earlier.

235
00:47:05.409 --> 00:47:07.628
It's a cave system.
Five clicks south.

236
00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:09.546
Might be worth a look.

237
00:47:10.581 --> 00:47:12.508
Hey, Too Late.

238
00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:14.417
Need to pull a node from your ship

239
00:47:14.418 --> 00:47:16.252
and store it right here
next to mine. Okay?

240
00:47:16.253 --> 00:47:17.837
Really? Why is that?

241
00:47:17.838 --> 00:47:21.600
Riddick triggered the beacon
to get off-world, right?

242
00:47:21.884 --> 00:47:26.230
Basically, he was calling a taxi.

243
00:47:27.682 --> 00:47:29.274
And...

244
00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:32.352
And a ship would make
a sweet trap, right?

245
00:47:32.353 --> 00:47:36.740
Confined space, metal
walls, jail cell.

246
00:47:37.775 --> 00:47:39.192
Is cool, huh?

247
00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:40.944
Is it true half the
people you meet

248
00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:42.696
are below average intelligence?

249
00:47:42.697 --> 00:47:43.953
Got to make sure the ship stays

250
00:47:43.954 --> 00:47:45.573
grounded when he comes
for them, okay?

251
00:47:45.574 --> 00:47:47.584
Come on.

252
00:47:47.702 --> 00:47:50.838
Dahl, pull a node from the ship.

253
00:48:15.271 --> 00:48:16.438
I'll do it...

254
00:48:16.439 --> 00:48:17.522
Ooh.

255
00:48:17.523 --> 00:48:18.824
Ooh...

256
00:48:38.002 --> 00:48:40.220
Any time now, Riddick.

257
00:49:03.694 --> 00:49:05.779
I'm telling you, this
is total overkill.

258
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.998
What? Eleven of us out here now?

259
00:49:08.199 --> 00:49:10.909
Should have been a
four-man op, tops.

260
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.870
You are jinxing our janx,
man. And that ain't cool.

261
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:17.508
Hey, I don't give a shit
what they say. He's one guy.

262
00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:21.637
Whatever you say, man.

263
00:49:22.171 --> 00:49:24.098
He's one guy.

264
00:49:27.176 --> 00:49:28.644
Man...

265
00:49:39.105 --> 00:49:42.366
So I guess that's what passes for
a fucking moon on this planet.

266
00:49:43.359 --> 00:49:45.703
It's gonna be a dark night.

267
00:49:45.986 --> 00:49:47.871
Advantage, him.

268
00:49:48.864 --> 00:49:51.115
Maybe he's gonna
wear you down first.

269
00:49:51.116 --> 00:49:52.951
Force you to go without sleep.

270
00:49:52.952 --> 00:49:55.129
Can't you see I'm busy?

271
00:49:55.788 --> 00:49:57.956
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

272
00:49:57.957 --> 00:50:00.926
Well, now that you have,

273
00:50:02.378 --> 00:50:04.713
can I politely invite you to

274
00:50:04.714 --> 00:50:07.391
step off my fucking porch?

275
00:50:09.802 --> 00:50:11.803
I'll start rotating down.

276
00:50:11.804 --> 00:50:13.304
You let me know, huh?

277
00:50:13.305 --> 00:50:17.234
As soon as I have his head in
a box, I will let you know.

278
00:50:41.542 --> 00:50:44.053
Grid 29D. Stand by, stand by.

279
00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:50.768
What you got, cuz?

280
00:50:52.345 --> 00:50:56.106
Aha, some dingo-dongo thing.

281
00:50:59.435 --> 00:51:02.154
Yeah. I see it now.

282
00:51:02.355 --> 00:51:03.521
You want me to pop it?

283
00:51:03.522 --> 00:51:06.367
Knock it down. One
shot suppressed.

284
00:51:11.155 --> 00:51:14.041
Nice work, Diaz. Encouraging.

285
00:51:14.658 --> 00:51:16.409
Had something in my eye.

286
00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:18.536
It's called a scope.

287
00:51:18.537 --> 00:51:20.464
Try next time.

288
00:51:20.498 --> 00:51:22.299
You got this, right?

289
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:26.053
Will you get off my
freaking frequency.

290
00:51:49.568 --> 00:51:51.328
What the fuck is going on here?

291
00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:15.519
Thank fucking God.

292
00:52:16.012 --> 00:52:17.563
Fuck off.

293
00:52:20.057 --> 00:52:24.236
Rubio, coming your way now.
Gotta swap out a bad sensor.

294
00:52:27.982 --> 00:52:30.817
What was here versus
what was found.

295
00:52:30.818 --> 00:52:32.569
How does it square?

296
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.487
Pretty good. I mean,
the morphine's gone,

297
00:52:34.488 --> 00:52:37.458
but that's always the
first thing to go.

298
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.377
That was a bit weird, though.

299
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:44.381
A predator restraint with
42-inch offset jaws.

300
00:52:44.498 --> 00:52:46.925
Six listed, zero found.

301
00:52:47.418 --> 00:52:50.095
That is an odd thing
to go for a walk.

302
00:52:50.129 --> 00:52:52.964
Yeah, but, Boss, you know how shit
goes missing from these stations.

303
00:52:52.965 --> 00:52:56.477
One bad year and guys are
ripping shit off for salvage.

304
00:53:04.518 --> 00:53:06.278
Hey, Santana?

305
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:09.573
You did sweep the area
before I got here, right?

306
00:53:09.607 --> 00:53:11.608
Sweep for what?

307
00:53:11.609 --> 00:53:13.943
I just want to make sure no
one has set any traps for us.

308
00:53:13.944 --> 00:53:15.454
5Q.

309
00:53:18.115 --> 00:53:19.949
Understand what I'm saying?

310
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:22.419
Traps? What kind of traps?

311
00:53:22.578 --> 00:53:24.463
The kind with jaws.

312
00:53:31.295 --> 00:53:33.263
Don't touch that fucking thing.

313
00:53:39.387 --> 00:53:40.729
What?

314
00:53:44.642 --> 00:53:45.943
Up-armour.

315
00:53:56.529 --> 00:53:57.904
Shit.

316
00:53:57.905 --> 00:53:59.748
Ready. Ready.

317
00:54:04.036 --> 00:54:05.754
Stay put, stay put,
stay put, stay put.

318
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.509
Oopah.

319
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.975
Who the hell was that
screaming and why?

320
00:54:19.427 --> 00:54:23.105
Nunez, break out the sweep gear.

321
00:54:23.764 --> 00:54:27.267
And figure out how many
of these big-ass traps

322
00:54:27.268 --> 00:54:29.528
we got out here, okay?

323
00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:32.856
I'm thinking maybe the
whole upper left quad

324
00:54:32.857 --> 00:54:35.492
is some kind of
fucking mine field.

325
00:54:35.693 --> 00:54:38.287
You got to do that
now, okay, Nunez?

326
00:54:39.947 --> 00:54:41.874
Copy that, Nunez?

327
00:54:46.245 --> 00:54:48.088
Nunez?

328
00:54:49.874 --> 00:54:52.760
This is bad. This is very bad.

329
00:54:54.628 --> 00:54:56.046
Nunez? Nunez?

330
00:54:56.047 --> 00:54:57.547
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

331
00:54:57.548 --> 00:55:00.434
His radio just crapped out.
Someone get eyes on him.

332
00:55:00.551 --> 00:55:03.854
Make sure he's right where he
should be, 13-H. Go, go, go.

333
00:55:10.895 --> 00:55:12.062
Right here.

334
00:55:12.063 --> 00:55:14.531
13-H. He's supposed to
be right fucking...

335
00:55:20.738 --> 00:55:24.282
So this was overkill, huh?
Eleven of us, too many. Yeah.

336
00:55:24.283 --> 00:55:26.368
You know all about Riddick, right?

337
00:55:26.369 --> 00:55:29.329
Well, maybe you need to
take that shit back.

338
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:32.591
Take the jinx off our
janx. You understand me?

339
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.751
That's what you need to do, Falco.

340
00:55:34.752 --> 00:55:37.888
You need to unjinxelate
our fucking janx.

341
00:55:44.679 --> 00:55:47.064
Don't mess with me now.

342
00:55:48.933 --> 00:55:50.253
Hey. Hey, what is it? What is it?

343
00:55:50.254 --> 00:55:51.504
- Get back.
- It's me, it's me.

344
00:55:51.505 --> 00:55:53.070
He's got Falco.

345
00:56:01.612 --> 00:56:04.123
Jock up, but you're staying home.

346
00:56:04.782 --> 00:56:07.584
No one's going out
there until I say so.

347
00:56:07.785 --> 00:56:09.077
Man down, he's got Falco.

348
00:56:09.078 --> 00:56:10.328
Compromise, compromise.

349
00:56:10.329 --> 00:56:11.413
How the fuck did he do that?

350
00:56:11.414 --> 00:56:13.498
Never ever saw him, man. He
was right here and I never...

351
00:56:13.499 --> 00:56:14.819
What about the ship? Is he on it?

352
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.101
He's not coming for the ships,
he's coming for fucking us.

353
00:56:17.121 --> 00:56:18.769
Just fucking shoot. Shoot.

354
00:56:26.595 --> 00:56:28.605
One night, three dead.

355
00:56:29.056 --> 00:56:31.108
Not sure I'm loving this trend.

356
00:56:31.475 --> 00:56:32.767
Two dead, one missing.

357
00:56:32.768 --> 00:56:34.310
Exactly. Three dead.

358
00:56:34.311 --> 00:56:37.239
Well, look at it this way, boys.

359
00:56:39.316 --> 00:56:41.234
We might all fit on one ship now.

360
00:56:41.235 --> 00:56:42.619
Diaz.

361
00:56:46.991 --> 00:56:49.168
Get those other traps back there.

362
00:56:49.493 --> 00:56:53.964
Luna, say something
Bible-like over these bodies.

363
00:57:03.883 --> 00:57:05.976
Okay, maybe,

364
00:57:07.345 --> 00:57:09.480
we zero this out.

365
00:57:11.223 --> 00:57:13.108
What is your tag anyway?

366
00:57:13.351 --> 00:57:15.527
So now you wanna know my name.

367
00:57:18.022 --> 00:57:19.981
Well, I'm not sure I'm gonna say.

368
00:57:19.982 --> 00:57:23.243
Because everyone you know by
name, Santana, winds up dead.

369
00:57:26.197 --> 00:57:27.956
You gonna clean this shit up?

370
00:57:37.208 --> 00:57:39.176
- Excuse me.
- Wow.

371
00:57:39.335 --> 00:57:41.762
Watch out for surprise attacks.

372
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.722
Maybe...

373
00:57:44.215 --> 00:57:48.435
Maybe it's time to start
merging assets, right?

374
00:57:50.721 --> 00:57:52.982
So this is you asking for my help?

375
00:57:53.057 --> 00:57:56.735
This is me saying that I may
need some of your gear.

376
00:57:58.229 --> 00:58:02.241
If some of your guys happen to
come attached to that gear,

377
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:06.954
I will understand that's
the way it's gotta be.

378
00:58:08.197 --> 00:58:10.374
So you're asking for
my gear's help?

379
00:58:10.866 --> 00:58:12.543
More like that.

380
00:58:13.369 --> 00:58:14.878
Moss...

381
00:58:21.711 --> 00:58:24.430
The gear's saying, Nah. Bitch.

382
00:58:25.006 --> 00:58:26.589
There's your answer.

383
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.842
What the fuck do you want, man?

384
00:58:28.843 --> 00:58:32.438
You know what? I'm gonna
fold you in, Santana.

385
00:58:32.555 --> 00:58:36.766
But I give orders to Dahl. And
Dahl's gonna give orders to you.

386
00:58:36.767 --> 00:58:39.945
And that's the chain of command
from this point forward.

387
00:58:40.229 --> 00:58:43.157
Why am I not loving
this plan so far?

388
00:58:44.108 --> 00:58:46.860
Oh, I know, I know. You know why?

389
00:58:46.861 --> 00:58:49.621
Because it sucks ass and swallows.

390
00:58:49.905 --> 00:58:52.490
I'm not taking orders
from your pet whore

391
00:58:52.491 --> 00:58:54.293
who thinks I won't smack
her right back...

392
00:58:56.746 --> 00:58:58.630
I don't fuck guys.

393
00:58:59.415 --> 00:59:02.217
Occasionally I fuck 'em
up if they need it.

394
00:59:04.587 --> 00:59:06.493
Here's what's gonna
happen, Santana.

395
00:59:06.494 --> 00:59:08.089
You're gonna take a back seat.

396
00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:10.184
We'll track Riddick
down, I promise.

397
00:59:10.468 --> 00:59:12.385
But I want him alive.

398
00:59:12.386 --> 00:59:16.607
You give me a day, and after
that he's yours to kill.

399
00:59:16.891 --> 00:59:18.725
You're giving me the bounty?

400
00:59:18.726 --> 00:59:23.113
You pay my crew, fuel costs, the
rest is yours. That's the deal.

401
00:59:24.398 --> 00:59:28.786
What is Riddick for you?
Not just some convict.

402
00:59:28.944 --> 00:59:31.830
What do you want?
Why are you here?

403
00:59:31.989 --> 00:59:33.457
Who are you?

404
00:59:34.492 --> 00:59:36.085
My name is Johns.

405
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.536
Lock down those ships,
get those hogs on deck.

406
00:59:38.537 --> 00:59:40.538
I will ride with
Moss and Lockspur.

407
00:59:40.539 --> 00:59:42.834
I want a non-lethal
load-out, L.O.D.'s

408
00:59:42.835 --> 00:59:44.834
and phosphor frags to start with.

409
00:59:44.835 --> 00:59:49.056
This is a man that hunts by night.
We'll take it to him by day.

410
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:53.727
Diaz. Vargas. Show me the
spot of the last kill.

411
00:59:56.806 --> 00:59:58.565
Some kind of canine.

412
01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.039
Hey, Diaz, I got a dog here.

413
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.501
Is it the same dingo-dongo
thing from last night?

414
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.503
Nah, I'm pretty sure
we killed that one.

415
01:00:26.794 --> 01:00:28.595
Could be the same one.

416
01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:30.046
The same.

417
01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:33.017
Dahl, get your sniper rifle
and barium rounds now.

418
01:00:44.562 --> 01:00:46.280
1,500 metres.

419
01:01:58.844 --> 01:02:01.230
Could be just the
first hole it found.

420
01:02:01.472 --> 01:02:04.942
A stressed animal is gonna
run to ground it knows.

421
01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:09.279
Besides, I'm getting
human pheromones.

422
01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:34.031
Riddick.

423
01:03:40.988 --> 01:03:43.374
Dial down, dial down, dial down.

424
01:03:50.998 --> 01:03:52.374
Santana's guy.

425
01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:53.458
Falco.

426
01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:55.502
Shit. Did we just kill a hostage?

427
01:03:55.503 --> 01:03:57.545
I've been hunting
Riddick for 10 years.

428
01:03:57.546 --> 01:04:00.423
The concept of a hostage
has no appeal to him.

429
01:04:00.424 --> 01:04:02.601
Falco was already dead.

430
01:04:02.802 --> 01:04:06.230
This is just some fucking
sideshow to buy more time.

431
01:04:08.599 --> 01:04:10.901
Whoa. Fuck...

432
01:04:11.686 --> 01:04:13.320
Shit.

433
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.575
Just dropped some mud right there.

434
01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:21.829
So if Riddick isn't here...

435
01:05:01.986 --> 01:05:06.081
Dahl? Dahl, do you copy?
Does anyone copy?

436
01:05:06.574 --> 01:05:08.292
Dahl, you there?

437
01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:05.474
Boom.

438
01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:11.355
Were you just perving
out on me somehow?

439
01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:14.984
May all your dreams
come true, baby.

440
01:06:16.352 --> 01:06:20.030
You've got two minutes. I want
you out on fucking watch.

441
01:06:25.611 --> 01:06:27.037
Luna.

442
01:06:31.826 --> 01:06:36.005
Don't watch me. Watch my back.
That's what you're here for.

443
01:06:36.539 --> 01:06:39.258
Take two steps forward. Two.

444
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.062
Remember, he could be anywhere.

445
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.115
This is Johns to
any-goddamn-body at the station.

446
01:07:45.441 --> 01:07:49.828
I want you to keep an eye on that
locker. Keep an eye on the node.

447
01:07:49.987 --> 01:07:52.665
Riddick may have made an end run.

448
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:57.127
My ETA is seven minutes.
But watch your back.

449
01:08:06.504 --> 01:08:08.681
All right, you little bitch.

450
01:08:10.508 --> 01:08:13.644
Your two minutes are up. You
gonna do what I tell you to do?

451
01:08:14.345 --> 01:08:17.180
Rumour is Riddick might
be in the vicinity.

452
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:19.984
Thought I should just
check on the locker.

453
01:08:21.394 --> 01:08:26.156
Get outside, get on your optics,
and get after this fucker.

454
01:08:26.524 --> 01:08:28.867
You're not gonna find him here.

455
01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:46.135
Actually, Dahl, I think we
have something in common.

456
01:08:46.752 --> 01:08:49.888
I don't fuck guys either.

457
01:09:34.967 --> 01:09:37.061
You need to see this.

458
01:09:45.436 --> 01:09:46.904
He wrote that?

459
01:09:47.646 --> 01:09:51.367
He took out our deep space
communications. All of it.

460
01:09:51.817 --> 01:09:55.412
And whose blood is
that? There... Here...

461
01:09:55.821 --> 01:09:57.748
Over there...

462
01:10:02.787 --> 01:10:05.798
I had to kick his
ass again. Sorry.

463
01:10:06.874 --> 01:10:08.300
Not really.

464
01:10:16.092 --> 01:10:17.434
Fuck it.

465
01:10:18.594 --> 01:10:21.105
Let's take a look at this.

466
01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:33.742
Stop.

467
01:10:36.112 --> 01:10:37.871
That key leave your neck?

468
01:10:39.573 --> 01:10:40.874
Never.

469
01:10:40.991 --> 01:10:43.085
Well, the only reason
to write fair trade

470
01:10:43.619 --> 01:10:46.746
is if he got into that locker
and he took something out.

471
01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:50.208
Something that we need,
like a power node,

472
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:53.637
which he could then swap
for something he needs.

473
01:10:54.255 --> 01:10:56.849
All that? Wow.

474
01:10:57.133 --> 01:10:59.601
Highly unlikely.

475
01:11:01.178 --> 01:11:03.221
Let me join the fucking
dots for you, Santana.

476
01:11:03.222 --> 01:11:05.382
Here's what I'm saying. If
he did get in there somehow,

477
01:11:05.402 --> 01:11:09.622
he was in a position to relock
it and change the code.

478
01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:12.573
Could be entering the
wrong shit, Santana.

479
01:11:14.567 --> 01:11:16.118
So,

480
01:11:17.278 --> 01:11:21.874
do you think sometime
during the last few hours

481
01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:25.910
he got this off my neck
without me noticing,

482
01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:29.039
did whatever he did, put
the fucking key back

483
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.259
on my fucking neck without
me fucking noticing?

484
01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:34.085
Is that what you're saying?

485
01:11:34.086 --> 01:11:38.048
Where did you get that theory
from? A unicorn's ass?

486
01:11:38.049 --> 01:11:40.133
There's a reason he is who he is.

487
01:11:40.134 --> 01:11:44.355
He's a convict. Not
some Zulu warlock.

488
01:11:44.972 --> 01:11:47.066
You know what you know.

489
01:12:02.198 --> 01:12:03.916
This is crazy.

490
01:12:04.325 --> 01:12:07.795
This is fucking crazy. The
first three clicks were good.

491
01:12:08.079 --> 01:12:09.496
It did not go off.

492
01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:12.207
You can get three clicks
in Russian roulette.

493
01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:14.209
Doesn't mean you get
four, motherfucker.

494
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:15.543
You know what, Santana?

495
01:12:15.544 --> 01:12:17.744
For once I actually agree with
you. I think you're good.

496
01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:19.848
Shut up.

497
01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.312
You. Do you think we're good?

498
01:12:26.013 --> 01:12:27.439
Yeah.

499
01:12:27.598 --> 01:12:29.483
I think you're good, cuz.

500
01:12:29.558 --> 01:12:31.902
You're fucking good.
Just butch up.

501
01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:36.281
Sounds like your
department, lesbo.

502
01:12:36.524 --> 01:12:37.732
I'm not opening that thing.

503
01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:39.067
Oh, yes, you fucking are.

504
01:12:39.068 --> 01:12:40.536
I'm so fucking not.

505
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:45.115
Hey, hey, hey. Use
your fucking brains.

506
01:12:45.116 --> 01:12:48.419
We are not gonna do
Riddick's work for him.

507
01:12:48.911 --> 01:12:50.879
Put your weapons down.

508
01:12:51.038 --> 01:12:52.673
And have a look at that.

509
01:12:53.541 --> 01:12:55.259
He was here.

510
01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:57.177
Right fucking there.

511
01:12:57.461 --> 01:13:00.431
Santana, put your
fucking sword away.

512
01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:05.552
Don't fucking open it, then.

513
01:13:05.553 --> 01:13:06.918
Well, the problem with that,

514
01:13:06.919 --> 01:13:08.722
Santana, we never
open that locker,

515
01:13:08.723 --> 01:13:10.774
and we never leave.

516
01:13:31.495 --> 01:13:33.589
The strength of my life of
Whom shall I be afraid.

517
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:39.970
Four.

518
01:13:48.179 --> 01:13:49.647
Five.

519
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:57.154
And...

520
01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:04.870
Oops.

521
01:14:05.696 --> 01:14:07.873
Wish I'd have thought of that.

522
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:19.218
Six.

523
01:14:22.546 --> 01:14:24.014
Six.

524
01:14:24.465 --> 01:14:25.766
Huh.

525
01:14:28.302 --> 01:14:29.770
Six.

526
01:14:31.639 --> 01:14:35.442
You are a shit storm trooper,
Santana. I'll give you that.

527
01:14:35.518 --> 01:14:37.727
You beat the devil this time.

528
01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:40.364
Didn't actually think
he was gonna do it.

529
01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:42.658
This is a sign.

530
01:14:43.526 --> 01:14:47.454
Ah, sweet.

531
01:14:47.488 --> 01:14:49.623
I believe this is a sign.

532
01:14:52.076 --> 01:14:55.120
It may be that the good Lord
wants us to take these nodes

533
01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:58.674
and flee this planet
just as soon as we can.

534
01:15:02.712 --> 01:15:05.180
That's my good luck charm.

535
01:15:08.259 --> 01:15:10.352
Wrong business, kid.

536
01:15:11.137 --> 01:15:14.982
You know, I was kind of
hoping the bomb would go off.

537
01:15:23.524 --> 01:15:25.586
So we sealed up his cave with some

538
01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:28.194
phosphor frags here,
so he can't go back.

539
01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:31.281
And just like an animal, he's
gonna head to known ground.

540
01:15:31.282 --> 01:15:34.325
But we're gonna find he's got
three or four lairs out there.

541
01:15:34.326 --> 01:15:37.546
So we'll radius out
from this point, here.

542
01:15:37.788 --> 01:15:41.666
Now radio comms... I saw three
repeaters listed in inventory.

543
01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:44.845
Find them. Set them up
at regular intervals.

544
01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:47.765
I never want to be out of
touch like that again.

545
01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:24.927
Are you scared of me?

546
01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:28.138
Yeah.

547
01:16:31.884 --> 01:16:34.144
Are they scared of me?

548
01:16:35.513 --> 01:16:37.982
Yes, they're scared of you.

549
01:16:43.646 --> 01:16:46.699
Maybe you're all scared
of the wrong thing.

550
01:16:46.941 --> 01:16:49.275
Lockspur, I want you to lock
down those hogs, all right?

551
01:16:49.276 --> 01:16:52.529
I don't want this guy any more
mobile than he already is.

552
01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:55.323
Now, Dahl, I spotted a
nice little nest for you.

553
01:16:55.324 --> 01:16:57.501
Right here and in these low hills.

554
01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:05.342
Moss?

555
01:17:08.546 --> 01:17:10.431
I just saw him.

556
01:17:11.632 --> 01:17:13.559
Say again?

557
01:17:14.093 --> 01:17:16.020
I just saw him.

558
01:17:26.439 --> 01:17:28.106
Dahl, I want you to
sit on this ship.

559
01:17:28.107 --> 01:17:30.692
Diaz, make sure your
ship is locked down.

560
01:17:30.693 --> 01:17:32.736
The rest of you get on
the fucking perimeter

561
01:17:32.737 --> 01:17:34.779
and keep your eyes on each other.

562
01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.500
Santana. He got the fucking nodes.

563
01:18:25.956 --> 01:18:28.759
I know. It's coming.

564
01:18:31.796 --> 01:18:33.463
So then we just combine nodes.

565
01:18:33.464 --> 01:18:35.632
Pull one from that ship, put
it in this ship, you know?

566
01:18:35.633 --> 01:18:36.800
Amps is amps, right?

567
01:18:36.801 --> 01:18:39.511
It's not about amps. It's about
what each ship is rated to handle.

568
01:18:39.512 --> 01:18:41.032
You miss by even a
few milli-joules,

569
01:18:41.033 --> 01:18:42.305
you fry every chip you've got.

570
01:18:42.306 --> 01:18:44.724
Okay, so figure out the
difference, and just do it.

571
01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:46.476
Jailbreak the fucking thing.

572
01:18:46.477 --> 01:18:48.436
I could give you a crash course

573
01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:51.773
on thermodynamic equilibrium
and energy exchange right now,

574
01:18:51.774 --> 01:18:53.974
or maybe you just want to take
my goddamn word for it...

575
01:18:53.994 --> 01:18:55.235
I get it. I get it.

576
01:18:55.236 --> 01:18:56.864
The ships are
incompatible. We're not

577
01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:58.321
gonna fly without the nodes back.

578
01:18:58.322 --> 01:19:00.448
Why do I feel like we just
cut off our own nuts here?

579
01:19:00.449 --> 01:19:02.001
Probably because we did.

580
01:19:02.118 --> 01:19:04.661
How about I take one of those jet
hogs, two days' worth of food

581
01:19:04.662 --> 01:19:06.454
and go out and hunt this
fucker down myself?

582
01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:09.082
Bad idea, Diaz.
One-on-one with Riddick?

583
01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:11.668
I might be able to get the
emergency beacon working again.

584
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:14.170
That's like an ambulance calling
for an ambulance, isn't it?

585
01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:16.506
It's back-up for the
fucking back-up. We can't.

586
01:19:16.507 --> 01:19:18.216
I thought he was the
one stranded here.

587
01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:20.176
Yeah, well, looks like
you thought wrong.

588
01:19:20.177 --> 01:19:22.771
Long wait for back-up.

589
01:19:24.181 --> 01:19:25.557
In case you were thinking about

590
01:19:25.558 --> 01:19:28.652
fixing the beacon and
calling for help.

591
01:19:28.686 --> 01:19:30.571
Falco's radio.

592
01:19:30.646 --> 01:19:34.074
Riddick, I don't give a
fuck about the back-up.

593
01:19:34.692 --> 01:19:36.359
Because I've still got
all kinds of gear

594
01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.162
that can ruin your day in a hurry.

595
01:19:40.197 --> 01:19:43.042
So you go find another
fucking cave.

596
01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.961
You keep running, you keep hiding.

597
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:48.672
Doesn't matter me none.

598
01:19:49.206 --> 01:19:52.176
Because in the end,
I will find you.

599
01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:56.513
Look south.

600
01:20:17.568 --> 01:20:19.620
I don't believe it.

601
01:20:19.779 --> 01:20:22.373
The balls on this fucking guy.

602
01:20:24.408 --> 01:20:27.044
Dahl, keep an eye on things here.

603
01:20:29.121 --> 01:20:30.246
What should I do?

604
01:20:30.247 --> 01:20:31.548
Stay low.

605
01:20:34.085 --> 01:20:36.136
Come on. Come on.

606
01:20:57.608 --> 01:20:59.535
Both of you drop.

607
01:21:22.133 --> 01:21:24.393
So what's the bounty at?

608
01:21:24.468 --> 01:21:27.303
I don't know. I don't care.
It's not why I'm here.

609
01:21:27.304 --> 01:21:29.773
I bet the big jamoke knows.

610
01:21:29.807 --> 01:21:32.609
Yeah. I know exactly what it is.

611
01:21:32.977 --> 01:21:36.780
What I do know is that it's double
if you're brought back dead.

612
01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:39.116
That's new.

613
01:21:40.317 --> 01:21:43.370
Will it be enough to
pay for your funerals?

614
01:21:44.864 --> 01:21:47.124
What I'm interested in

615
01:21:47.158 --> 01:21:51.795
is a little backwater place
with a system code M-344/G.

616
01:21:52.496 --> 01:21:55.632
I want to know what happened
there 10 years ago.

617
01:21:58.336 --> 01:22:00.012
The father.

618
01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:05.175
Big Daddy Johns.

619
01:22:05.176 --> 01:22:06.843
Yeah, that's right.

620
01:22:06.844 --> 01:22:10.773
And you travelled all
this way just to see me.

621
01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:14.318
I'm flattered.

622
01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.840
It's kind of strange not knowing

623
01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.780
what to put down in
the family bible.

624
01:22:17.897 --> 01:22:19.503
It's kind of strange
three guys have

625
01:22:19.504 --> 01:22:21.066
to die just so that
you can hear...

626
01:22:21.067 --> 01:22:24.286
No, no, no. You don't get
to put that shit on me.

627
01:22:24.487 --> 01:22:26.497
Those kills are on you.

628
01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:30.250
I have a feeling that's not the
only thing on me right now.

629
01:22:30.409 --> 01:22:33.370
Okay, got barium shells,
stab-shock, explosive tip.

630
01:22:33.371 --> 01:22:35.881
What do you want,
barium or stab-shock?

631
01:22:36.082 --> 01:22:37.925
Horse tranq.

632
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:39.593
Okay.

633
01:22:44.548 --> 01:22:48.176
I hate to interrupt this
discussion about ancient history,

634
01:22:48.177 --> 01:22:51.480
but maybe I should step in right
here and introduce myself.

635
01:22:51.555 --> 01:22:53.857
- My name is...
- Box Boy.

636
01:22:55.559 --> 01:22:57.060
Say what?

637
01:22:57.061 --> 01:22:59.594
You are the guy who
said that he was

638
01:22:59.595 --> 01:23:01.991
gonna put my head in a box. Right?

639
01:23:02.692 --> 01:23:06.662
Well, that was me spitting noise.

640
01:23:08.239 --> 01:23:10.240
But you do have a box.

641
01:23:10.241 --> 01:23:12.117
Do I have a box?

642
01:23:12.118 --> 01:23:14.086
Thought I saw one.

643
01:23:15.413 --> 01:23:18.957
I mean, of course I've got a
box. Everyone's got a box, man.

644
01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:21.885
Even Diaz has a fucking huge box.

645
01:23:22.586 --> 01:23:24.179
Good.

646
01:23:24.922 --> 01:23:26.890
We're gonna use it.

647
01:23:30.428 --> 01:23:33.022
Three down, eight left.

648
01:23:33.431 --> 01:23:35.816
Now, normally I'd just keep going.

649
01:23:35.933 --> 01:23:39.778
Six down... Nine down...

650
01:23:40.438 --> 01:23:43.324
You get where I'm going with this.

651
01:23:43.774 --> 01:23:45.483
But things are changing here

652
01:23:45.484 --> 01:23:49.538
and nobody wants to be on this
planet 24 hours from now.

653
01:23:50.281 --> 01:23:52.666
So I suggest we make it work.

654
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:55.035
What do you want, a
gentleman's agreement?

655
01:23:55.036 --> 01:23:58.505
I'll leave one node out
in the open. You take it.

656
01:23:58.956 --> 01:24:02.292
The other node and the
other ship are mine.

657
01:24:02.293 --> 01:24:03.543
Hey, wait, wait.

658
01:24:03.544 --> 01:24:08.182
What are we playing here,
retard bingo? What?

659
01:24:08.341 --> 01:24:10.342
That was on the table
from the start...

660
01:24:10.343 --> 01:24:12.478
Forget the start.

661
01:24:14.347 --> 01:24:17.358
It's the end you want
to think about now.

662
01:24:19.685 --> 01:24:21.445
See that?

663
01:24:25.024 --> 01:24:28.577
I'll give you till that
rain hits that station.

664
01:24:30.363 --> 01:24:32.289
That's your clock.

665
01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:41.465
Box Boy...

666
01:24:56.222 --> 01:24:58.482
Dahl. Do it now. Now.

667
01:25:14.699 --> 01:25:16.083
Again.

668
01:25:22.039 --> 01:25:23.799
He's not going down.

669
01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.762
Do it again, Dahl.

670
01:25:34.218 --> 01:25:36.103
Just go down.

671
01:26:28.522 --> 01:26:30.115
I got this, Dahl.

672
01:27:04.392 --> 01:27:05.776
Riddick.

673
01:27:05.935 --> 01:27:07.444
Riddick?

674
01:27:16.487 --> 01:27:18.122
Johns?

675
01:27:21.033 --> 01:27:23.794
We beating men in chains now?

676
01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:33.721
Okay, from the beginning. For
the historical record...

677
01:27:34.505 --> 01:27:35.672
The Hunter Gratzner.

678
01:27:35.673 --> 01:27:37.273
That's the commercial
vessel my son uses

679
01:27:37.274 --> 01:27:38.754
to transport you
back to the slammer.

680
01:27:38.774 --> 01:27:43.388
But that ship sends a distress
call somewhere near M-344/G.

681
01:27:43.389 --> 01:27:47.151
It's a backwater system, with
two suns, one habitable planet.

682
01:27:49.186 --> 01:27:51.572
Does he survive the crash?

683
01:27:52.356 --> 01:27:54.992
Big drama the next few hours.

684
01:27:55.526 --> 01:28:00.164
But whatever happens, no
matter what they tell you,

685
01:28:01.699 --> 01:28:03.959
don't let 'em take
these chains off me.

686
01:28:04.618 --> 01:28:07.162
Them? Who's them? Who
are you talking...

687
01:28:07.163 --> 01:28:09.173
Do you know who you're
talking to here?

688
01:28:13.127 --> 01:28:14.678
That was for me?

689
01:28:17.048 --> 01:28:18.548
When the chains come off...

690
01:28:18.549 --> 01:28:19.716
Jesus Christ.

691
01:28:19.717 --> 01:28:21.018
Box Boy,

692
01:28:21.719 --> 01:28:25.022
you go in the first five seconds.

693
01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:27.691
Really?

694
01:28:28.559 --> 01:28:31.362
And you plan on killing
me with what, your mouth?

695
01:28:32.021 --> 01:28:33.530
That shiny blade.

696
01:28:34.648 --> 01:28:36.617
I'd love to see you try.

697
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.206
For the historical record,

698
01:28:43.741 --> 01:28:45.084
he made it.

699
01:28:51.248 --> 01:28:53.217
So it's just you and him?

700
01:28:54.168 --> 01:28:55.636
Was,

701
01:28:56.587 --> 01:28:59.640
about the same number you
see here in this room.

702
01:29:00.966 --> 01:29:03.227
So how many made it off?

703
01:29:03.678 --> 01:29:05.187
Three.

704
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:08.065
But not him?

705
01:29:09.767 --> 01:29:11.235
No.

706
01:29:11.602 --> 01:29:13.530
So between the time
of the crash and

707
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:15.197
the time you leave that planet,

708
01:29:15.856 --> 01:29:17.700
my son dies.

709
01:29:17.775 --> 01:29:22.579
And I can safely assume it's
at your hands. Is that right?

710
01:29:25.282 --> 01:29:27.918
I'm wasting my fucking time here.

711
01:29:30.371 --> 01:29:32.673
You grant any last wishes?

712
01:29:38.129 --> 01:29:40.431
I was referring to you.

713
01:29:41.007 --> 01:29:45.728
Not that the chains aren't
a hot look, but no.

714
01:29:46.637 --> 01:29:49.347
I'm not gonna straddle you
in front of all these guys.

715
01:29:49.348 --> 01:29:51.692
What if I killed all of 'em first?

716
01:29:53.561 --> 01:29:55.571
Easy, boy.

717
01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:58.782
There's a lot more tranq
where that came from.

718
01:30:00.484 --> 01:30:03.620
Tell me what you see
outside that window, Dahl.

719
01:30:14.498 --> 01:30:16.967
Cyclops unit, two ships,

720
01:30:17.043 --> 01:30:19.553
couple dead guys in plastic.

721
01:30:20.004 --> 01:30:21.880
And you don't see anything else?

722
01:30:21.881 --> 01:30:23.641
Nothing else.

723
01:30:23.883 --> 01:30:26.143
Let me know when you do.

724
01:30:27.845 --> 01:30:30.314
Love those toenails, by the way.

725
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:33.984
Yeah?

726
01:30:34.143 --> 01:30:35.944
Predator Pink.

727
01:30:36.854 --> 01:30:38.489
Matches your nipples.

728
01:30:39.523 --> 01:30:42.951
Why are we even listening
to this big fuckstick?

729
01:30:43.194 --> 01:30:46.455
Can we just detach
his head, please?

730
01:30:47.073 --> 01:30:48.865
Here's what's gonna happen.

731
01:30:48.866 --> 01:30:50.033
The next 60 seconds,

732
01:30:50.034 --> 01:30:52.461
you're gonna watch your own
head drop into that box.

733
01:30:53.913 --> 01:30:55.381
Nothing,

734
01:30:55.915 --> 01:30:59.051
nothing is gonna keep you from
that special place in hell.

735
01:31:01.671 --> 01:31:03.082
Maybe in the last minute of your

736
01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.714
life, you want to
be something more

737
01:31:04.715 --> 01:31:07.059
than a goddamn savage.

738
01:31:08.886 --> 01:31:11.230
Gimme some fucking answers.

739
01:31:12.014 --> 01:31:13.565
Please.

740
01:31:22.566 --> 01:31:26.912
Is there anything you'd like to
add on the subject I just raised?

741
01:31:45.881 --> 01:31:47.558
Time's up.

742
01:31:53.597 --> 01:31:55.232
Time is up.

743
01:31:56.767 --> 01:31:58.777
He's all yours.

744
01:32:05.443 --> 01:32:07.369
Hold him down.

745
01:32:41.645 --> 01:32:43.489
More dingo-dongos maybe.

746
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.453
Fuck it.

747
01:32:52.531 --> 01:32:55.000
I know what's coming.

748
01:32:55.826 --> 01:32:59.630
Called to find you.
The serpents...

749
01:33:20.351 --> 01:33:21.944
Spotlight.

750
01:33:48.713 --> 01:33:50.347
Like I said,

751
01:33:51.507 --> 01:33:54.310
it ain't me you gotta worry about.

752
01:33:58.472 --> 01:34:00.941
What is it? What's out there?

753
01:34:01.183 --> 01:34:02.693
I don't know.

754
01:34:03.477 --> 01:34:05.279
Fucked up or something out there.

755
01:34:05.604 --> 01:34:09.325
It ain't right. It's
coming our way.

756
01:34:18.075 --> 01:34:21.628
Whatever they are, they
ain't so hard to kill.

757
01:35:02.203 --> 01:35:03.962
What the fuck?

758
01:35:24.767 --> 01:35:26.235
Fuck.

759
01:35:40.324 --> 01:35:42.626
No more holes, please.

760
01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.996
Now here's what's gonna happen.

761
01:36:20.156 --> 01:36:23.334
In 60 seconds you're gonna
take these chains off me.

762
01:36:23.451 --> 01:36:27.087
We're gonna make a play for those
nodes and get off this rock.

763
01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:32.676
But somewhere along the line,
when it gets really bad,

764
01:36:34.962 --> 01:36:36.430
Johns

765
01:36:38.007 --> 01:36:41.352
is gonna fold just
like Little Johns did.

766
01:36:43.012 --> 01:36:44.980
Then when it's all over

767
01:36:45.806 --> 01:36:48.901
and the rest of you are ready
for Dead Animal Pick-up,

768
01:36:49.894 --> 01:36:52.946
I'm gonna go balls deep into Dahl.

769
01:36:54.482 --> 01:36:57.242
But only because she asked me to.

770
01:36:58.319 --> 01:37:00.120
Sweet-like.

771
01:37:02.615 --> 01:37:04.699
What does he mean,
When things go bad?

772
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.877
What? This doesn't qualify as bad?

773
01:37:07.578 --> 01:37:10.923
What the fuck is happening?
How fucked are we?

774
01:37:11.082 --> 01:37:13.801
Who knows how long it will rain?

775
01:37:15.086 --> 01:37:19.431
Or just how many of them
are buried out there?

776
01:37:21.258 --> 01:37:23.513
He saw it. He saw
it with those eyes

777
01:37:23.514 --> 01:37:25.646
of his and he didn't tell us what.

778
01:37:35.314 --> 01:37:38.742
One ship for you, one for me.

779
01:37:39.318 --> 01:37:42.663
I need to know that these
nodes are retrievable.

780
01:37:44.115 --> 01:37:46.875
And I need to know we have a deal.

781
01:37:50.955 --> 01:37:52.840
We got a deal.

782
01:37:59.964 --> 01:38:02.474
The chains stay on.

783
01:38:15.396 --> 01:38:17.614
Why don't we sit this one out?

784
01:38:20.317 --> 01:38:21.910
Okay. Okay.

785
01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.289
Up, up, up...

786
01:38:28.284 --> 01:38:29.960
Good doggie.

787
01:38:54.518 --> 01:38:55.819
Oh.

788
01:39:07.531 --> 01:39:10.000
Holy shit.

789
01:39:13.037 --> 01:39:14.421
Yeah.

790
01:39:15.373 --> 01:39:17.424
Let's cut him loose.

791
01:39:18.501 --> 01:39:20.594
That was five seconds.

792
01:39:21.128 --> 01:39:23.889
I like to be a man of my word.

793
01:39:26.175 --> 01:39:29.061
How about you, Johns?

794
01:40:14.348 --> 01:40:17.392
For He shall give His angels
charge over me, keep me in

795
01:40:17.393 --> 01:40:19.674
- all His grace as long as I live.
- Shut the noise, Luna.

796
01:40:19.694 --> 01:40:24.033
You know, I think the angels
are here protecting me.

797
01:40:24.108 --> 01:40:25.859
And if they're here,
watching over me,

798
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:28.100
maybe they'll deliver us all
from this crazy, evil place.

799
01:40:28.101 --> 01:40:30.341
That shit is creeping everybody
out, so shut the fuck up.

800
01:40:30.361 --> 01:40:33.300
You shut the fuck up, Vargas.
Leave the kid alone.

801
01:40:40.374 --> 01:40:43.469
Where the hell did
that... Jesus Christ.

802
01:40:44.462 --> 01:40:45.929
No, no, no.

803
01:40:48.382 --> 01:40:51.134
What the fuck is wrong with
you, you crazy bastard?

804
01:40:51.135 --> 01:40:52.469
You could have killed me.

805
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:54.521
Got it, didn't I?

806
01:41:02.396 --> 01:41:04.281
Vargas, get up.

807
01:41:04.815 --> 01:41:07.159
Vargas, get up. Come on, let's go.

808
01:41:07.276 --> 01:41:08.985
Vargas, come on, man. Walk it off.

809
01:41:08.986 --> 01:41:10.829
Let's go. It's just a little one.

810
01:41:10.863 --> 01:41:13.082
Small ones are the worst.

811
01:41:14.408 --> 01:41:16.794
They save the most venom.

812
01:41:29.465 --> 01:41:30.975
And kid,

813
01:41:31.967 --> 01:41:34.135
leave God out of this.

814
01:41:34.136 --> 01:41:37.314
He wants no part of
what happens next.

815
01:41:47.983 --> 01:41:50.119
I forgot to mention,

816
01:41:51.529 --> 01:41:53.497
there's no weapons for you.

817
01:41:59.995 --> 01:42:02.214
You think you can ride
one of these things?

818
01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:04.842
I'll ride it like I stole it.

819
01:42:19.181 --> 01:42:21.025
I'll take flank.

820
01:42:31.694 --> 01:42:33.945
If Riddick comes back
here without us,

821
01:42:33.946 --> 01:42:37.323
you go ahead, you kill him
on general principle.

822
01:42:37.324 --> 01:42:40.669
Is that before or after
I'm supposed to fuck him?

823
01:45:12.563 --> 01:45:15.565
You asshole motherfucker.
Just sitting there watching.

824
01:45:15.566 --> 01:45:19.578
Would have covered you,
but you said, No weapons.

825
01:45:25.659 --> 01:45:28.837
How bad you want
those nodes, Johns?

826
01:46:04.323 --> 01:46:07.918
I don't suppose you took the
time to do this for him, huh?

827
01:46:09.787 --> 01:46:12.840
This may come as a
shock to you, Johns,

828
01:46:13.958 --> 01:46:16.260
but I didn't ghost your son.

829
01:46:18.087 --> 01:46:20.931
He seemed set on killing himself.

830
01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:26.186
What the fuck does that mean?

831
01:46:26.637 --> 01:46:28.397
Morphine.

832
01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.567
Your son liked his morphine.

833
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.778
Liked it twice a day.

834
01:46:35.354 --> 01:46:38.157
Didn't know your son was a junkie?

835
01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.662
Johns was like most Mercs.

836
01:46:44.071 --> 01:46:47.666
They look all
stand-up and do-right

837
01:46:48.075 --> 01:46:51.211
until you cut them open and
you find something missing.

838
01:46:51.912 --> 01:46:54.131
In his case, a spine.

839
01:46:55.916 --> 01:46:59.336
I don't have to listen to this
shit. That's not the man I knew.

840
01:46:59.337 --> 01:47:01.972
Then you didn't know your son.

841
01:47:06.802 --> 01:47:09.146
He wanted to kill a kid.

842
01:47:10.431 --> 01:47:12.566
To save his own skin.

843
01:47:12.850 --> 01:47:15.277
I had a problem with that.

844
01:47:16.437 --> 01:47:18.697
You expect me to believe

845
01:47:18.939 --> 01:47:22.284
my son was gonna kill a
child to save his own life?

846
01:47:24.236 --> 01:47:28.374
Morphine makes the brain
soft. Heart weak.

847
01:47:31.619 --> 01:47:33.962
I don't fucking buy it.

848
01:47:34.038 --> 01:47:36.331
I just can't believe that
my son's the bad guy

849
01:47:36.332 --> 01:47:39.718
in this fucking demented
fairy tale of yours.

850
01:47:42.254 --> 01:47:44.515
No reason to lie now.

851
01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:48.560
Johns.

852
01:47:51.639 --> 01:47:53.440
Either one of us.

853
01:48:22.294 --> 01:48:24.838
Thanks for starting the killing
spree for me, Riddick.

854
01:48:24.839 --> 01:48:27.057
But I'll take it from here.

855
01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:20.944
Jamoke.

856
01:49:25.649 --> 01:49:28.869
So that blade you buried
was meant for me?

857
01:49:30.112 --> 01:49:32.915
Anyone who deserved it, really.

858
01:49:35.993 --> 01:49:37.628
We've got a problem, Riddick,

859
01:49:39.288 --> 01:49:41.915
because I've got two nodes here.

860
01:49:41.916 --> 01:49:43.958
We've got one hog.

861
01:49:43.959 --> 01:49:48.305
And I sure as shit am not
riding bitch with you again.

862
01:49:50.341 --> 01:49:51.934
One hog?

863
01:49:53.135 --> 01:49:55.187
You sure about that, Johns?

864
01:50:00.893 --> 01:50:03.737
He pulled the goddamn turbine pin.

865
01:50:04.939 --> 01:50:07.282
You just figured that out?

866
01:50:07.566 --> 01:50:11.328
Diaz was gonna take the nodes
for himself and ghost me.

867
01:50:11.529 --> 01:50:14.498
He was gonna leave
you out here alone.

868
01:50:14.699 --> 01:50:16.500
So what now?

869
01:50:23.582 --> 01:50:26.302
Now we switch to our ground game.

870
01:50:27.586 --> 01:50:31.181
Let's see if that lack of
spine runs in the family.

871
01:51:22.933 --> 01:51:24.443
Reload.

872
01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:32.451
Watch your head.

873
01:51:42.536 --> 01:51:43.921
Go.

874
01:53:46.911 --> 01:53:48.295
I got inbound.

875
01:54:03.344 --> 01:54:05.229
Take this.

876
01:54:05.262 --> 01:54:07.272
Is it just you?

877
01:54:07.890 --> 01:54:10.526
Just slam this thing in.
See if it's still good.

878
01:54:13.604 --> 01:54:14.688
Boss...

879
01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:18.534
Just see if the fucking thing
works. We need to get outta here.

880
01:58:22.561 --> 01:58:26.448
Extraction, 30 seconds or
less. Let's go, let's go.

881
01:58:58.723 --> 01:59:00.858
Let me ask you something,

882
01:59:01.767 --> 01:59:03.861
sweet-like...

883
01:59:45.269 --> 01:59:47.404
Lot of good men
died here, Riddick.

884
01:59:47.521 --> 01:59:51.742
Not sure how I'm supposed to
overlook that. Next time.

885
01:59:51.817 --> 01:59:53.943
Yeah. Things would
have been different

886
01:59:53.944 --> 01:59:56.580
if they weren't trying
to put my head in a box.

887
01:59:58.991 --> 02:00:01.335
So where to now, Riddick?

888
02:00:01.702 --> 02:00:05.923
You know what? Fuck that. Don't
tell me. I don't wanna know.

889
02:00:06.457 --> 02:00:08.759
I'll tell you this, Johns.

890
02:00:08.834 --> 02:00:12.346
Sooner or later, we all
have to head home.

891
02:00:13.047 --> 02:00:15.557
Tell Dahl to keep it warm for me.

892
02:00:16.050 --> 02:00:17.851
And, Johns,

893
02:00:18.803 --> 02:00:21.188
you keep a strong spine.

894
02:01:08.352 --> 02:01:09.653
Vaako.

895
02:01:12.314 --> 02:01:15.034
- You are still alive.
- Tell me where.

896
02:01:16.902 --> 02:01:18.820
He's no longer among us.

897
02:01:18.821 --> 02:01:22.124
Tell me, and I'll kill him first.

898
02:01:22.408 --> 02:01:23.959
You misunderstand.

899
02:01:24.201 --> 02:01:27.338
Vaako is a decent man who
meant to honour his word.

900
02:01:27.747 --> 02:01:29.914
Even with you, strangely.

901
02:01:29.915 --> 02:01:31.666
I don't care about Furya.

902
02:01:31.667 --> 02:01:34.377
I don't care what the pact
was between you and him.

903
02:01:34.378 --> 02:01:36.713
This faith cannot
have a misbeliever

904
02:01:36.714 --> 02:01:38.256
or a kind heart leading it,

905
02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:41.602
and I have done what I
have done to ensure...

906
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:53.155
Too many words.

907
02:02:07.912 --> 02:02:10.547
Never lie to me,
I'll never hurt you.

908
02:02:13.918 --> 02:02:15.636
One word answer.

909
02:02:17.755 --> 02:02:19.556
Is Vaako alive or dead?

910
02:02:24.762 --> 02:02:26.063
Both.
