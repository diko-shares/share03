1
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:14,803
lt was fun

2
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:17,472
The water was chilled
Why didn't you come in?

3
00:01:17,982 --> 00:01:20,974
With you and me together,
the sea would've been on fire

4
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:38,164
Rajesh, l still can't believe
that you're back.

5
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:42,335
lf you say that one more time,
l'll vanish into thin air

6
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,014
Who were they?
- Who?

7
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:01,691
The ones who took you away

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,520
Some business
- What do they want?

9
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,198
They just wanted to meet me.
So l met them

10
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,201
Rajesh, stay away from them.
l think they are dangerous

11
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:23,713
So what? What can they do to us?

12
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:28,214
l'm afraid you're going back
to your old ways

13
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,288
l'm going nowhere Sheila.

14
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:37,223
Here l am. With you. Trust me

15
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:57,413
So much money?
Where did it come from?

16
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:02,074
Never mind where money comes from.
Just think about spending it

17
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:07,249
But where did you get the money?
- Enjoy the fruit. Never mind the tree

18
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,921
Who d'you love more?
Money? Or Sheila?

19
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:16,766
What a question!

20
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,943
What have you done?
- Something l should've done long ago

21
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,780
l thought after all you've been
through, you'd mend your ways

22
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,621
But now l know. You're incorrigible!
You're a thief to the core

23
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:45,626
Yes, thief l am!
But l don't rob the poor

24
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:50,126
The ones l steal from worship wealth,
yet they know not how to use her

25
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,628
Who gives you the right?
- They themselves

26
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:55,296
For they too have robbed
to amass their wealth

27
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,138
Sheila, why don't you understand?
l don't want to steal for myself

28
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,637
l want to give you all the riches
in the world!

29
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:06,308
Right no wrong l know not,
and l don't care

30
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:11,317
l can't bear to see you dancing
in the nightclubs

31
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:17,824
Would you rather have me begging
on the streets?

32
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,159
Do you know what it means to be lonely
for three and a half years?

33
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:27,996
lf you knew,
you'd never do this again.

34
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:33,001
Rajesh, l've realized for myself

35
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:37,506
ln the life you're making
for yourself, l have no place

36
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,895
l want this man

37
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:28,731
And l want him fast,
you understand?

38
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:38,070
You're a marksman!

39
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:41,740
Who is he?
- A criminal. Just like you

40
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:43,574
Gave me the slip

41
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,408
Looks like l'm the only fellow
who hasn't. Unfortunate

42
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:50,086
Where did you get
that mannequin made?

43
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:52,917
Why?
- l want one made. Just like you.

44
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,754
To pray to. For riddance.
- l told you to see me...

45
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,092
twice a week.
- No! You said once in two weeks

46
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,935
All right, you said twice a week.
But that look on your face...!

47
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:08,263
lt's loaded!

48
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:13,439
Empty

49
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:20,776
The next time you miss seeing me...
- Now where do l see you?

50
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,116
All day, you're doing
target practice

51
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:26,451
Then you stick a beard on your face and
you go singing in nightclubs at night

52
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,623
Same song! Encore!

53
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:42,130
Dulcet voice!

54
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,472
Listen

55
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:55,481
Am l following you around?
Or, are you following me around?

56
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:58,145
Don't be angry. You're the one
who has always been tailing me

57
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,983
And the way you've marked me,
oh it hurts!

58
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:11,328
Burnt currency notes. Found at the
place where you took your girlfriend

59
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:16,496
You seem to be back at it.
Take care

60
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:24,670
And if you miss the twice-a-week
... you know what

61
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:53,532
Where have you been?
- Around the world

62
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,535
When are you coming
to our world?

63
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,376
Haven't been able to decide yet.
l need time to think

64
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,222
Think it over. Think it over well.

65
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,228
Remember, the Princess isn't used
to taking a no for an answer

66
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:17,233
Are you threatening me?
- Not at all

67
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:37,754
We're talking! Can't you see?

68
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:57,603
Did you say something?
- l was saying...

69
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,277
after we're through,
the car moves

70
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:08,944
Now you're being polite.
You said something else...?

71
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:15,781
Want to hear it?
- lf you don't mind...

72
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:31,133
Want to hear it again?
- lt'll be enough for today

73
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,278
l hate murder

74
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:16,127
The next time we meet
will be your last time

75
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,823
Who was he?

76
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:38,327
Dangerous fellow. Take care

77
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,997
l will

78
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:46,165
Thanks. Had it not been for you,
he would've shot me

79
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:52,664
The bullets would've ricocheted
off your steel

80
00:12:58,381 --> 00:12:59,507
l've seen you somewhere

81
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:03,348
You're the motorbike daredevil,
aren't you?

82
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:08,683
What do you these days?
- l have the motorbike

83
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:10,860
l'm looking for an assignment

84
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,535
Are you deaf?

85
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,869
Parked right in the middle
of the street

86
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:29,704
Tall and handsome

87
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:32,541
You think they're tall and handsome?
- Of course

88
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:36,483
And you think l'm squat and ugly?
And so what? l'm your husband

89
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,554
Put your veil up.
They are strangers

90
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:42,216
And l think they are hoodlums.
- For you everyone is a hood

91
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:45,226
l'll show you what they are

92
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:47,563
Your turn

93
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:54,562
- Are you blind or deaf?
- Neither of it.

94
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:58,732
ls this any place to park your car?

95
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,744
- Forgive me
- What?!

96
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:05,073
What d'you take me for? A fool?
You think your father owns the road?

97
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:10,418
Your father owns the road
- He mentioned my father

98
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,920
You mentioned my father, did you?
Are you calling my father names?

99
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,418
First you park wrong, then
you throw your weight around?

100
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,760
With you, l'd never!
l don't want to get killed, do l?

101
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:30,270
Look at you... one blow from you
and l'd be deep-sixed

102
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:36,104
Darling, it took this fellow a minute
to realize what my capability is

103
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:41,614
And 12 years after the marriage,
and you still don't know!

104
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,454
Stop smiling, and start that car

105
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:51,624
Now make it fast,
or l'll crush that thing!

106
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:56,128
All right, l'm going.
- Shut up. Else l'll break your teeth

107
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:58,800
What?
- l was just talking about my wife

108
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:02,962
She keeps joking.
That's why l want to break her teeth

109
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:07,803
You're my brother!
Now don't bother a married man

110
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:11,640
Look, if you don't have petrol,
just fill it up. Get going

111
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:20,145
You think they are handsome?
And what do they think of me?

112
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:25,256
Stop boasting. The other night
when the thief came in...

113
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:27,329
what did you do? You locked yourself
inside the bathroom!

114
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,332
l went to get my gun.
l took the gun and l came out...

115
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,994
Standing in the middle of a road and
raking up the past! Don't you upset me

116
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,339
Come on. Sit in the car!
Don't you have any brains?

117
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,136
They're clapping...
they can't really be my sons!

118
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:55,016
Tina! What are you doing?
Stop it, Tina!

119
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:58,860
How are you darling?

120
00:15:59,128 --> 00:16:01,187
Sheila, are you angry with me?
- No

121
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:03,024
With Papa...?
- No

122
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,360
Then why didn't you come
to see us for so long?

123
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,370
lf you don't tell me,
l'll drench you

124
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:19,038
You live here?
- A part of me does. Come on

125
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:24,320
Stop, l say!

126
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:26,722
Enough

127
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:31,723
Now l'm getting angry.
Tina, stop. Else, l'll beat you

128
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:35,728
Keep it up. Her brains need
to cool down

129
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:37,066
Who are you?

130
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:42,571
Well, l am who l am.
But whose daughter are you?

131
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,740
Papa's

132
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:57,349
Your daughter?
- Yes

133
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:08,252
Which means...
you know each other?

134
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,105
No
- But of course, the kid...?

135
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,939
Neighbor. She comes to play with me

136
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:32,284
Strange. l just got to know him.
And you already know his daughter

137
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:35,188
This is Sheila

138
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,637
Bye Rajesh
- What's your hurry?

139
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:51,974
Some other time.
l know where to find you

140
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:17,406
What's up, Sheila?

141
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,240
l've refused to recognize you

142
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:28,907
But not to deceive Rajesh.
l don't want to lose him

143
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:35,746
He's madly in love with me.
lf he gets to know that...

144
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:42,428
you were in love with me,
he won't be able to bear it

145
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:48,931
And there's no knowing what he might
do. Please, never mention this to him

146
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:58,941
Trust me. This will stay a secret
Rajesh deserves your love

147
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:05,284
l'd be sorry if you lost him

148
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:37,482
You love Papa, don't you?
- l do

149
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:41,154
Will you listen to something, then?
- Yes

150
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:45,992
Don't go to see Sheila.
- Why?

151
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:49,331
There are some things...

152
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,658
Some things that you'll get to know
only once you grow up

153
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,520
Remember me telling you that we'll
meet once more for the last time?

154
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,200
Care for life? You're scared to die.

155
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:35,207
All my life, l've played with death

156
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:39,044
No dying for you.
l'll let you live.

157
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:43,548
A life worse than death

158
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,081
You're proud of the strength
in your legs, aren't you?

159
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:19,414
From now, you're crawling.
You'll beg for mercy

160
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:40,275
No
He's valuable

161
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:01,785
You're lucky to have
a friend like him

162
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:08,793
A friend he's mine too.
But why doesn't he behave like one?

163
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:16,801
Could your condition evoke
his friendlier instincts for me?

164
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:24,141
lf this is what you're going to do,
l'll never do it for you

165
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:30,151
All right, one more chance

166
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:34,324
Else, his daughter and your
girlfriend will fare worse

167
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,679
Good girls don't cry

168
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,530
Come home with me. Let Papa rest.
We'll come back tomorrow

169
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:21,710
Get well soon

170
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:42,887
Are you crying?
You mustn't

171
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,901
How about chewing gum?

172
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:02,242
ls she your daughter?

173
00:28:29,645 --> 00:28:32,773
My name is lnspector Khan.
l want to ask some questions

174
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,439
This is no time for questions

175
00:28:36,318 --> 00:28:41,278
Speak when you're spoken to.
As of now, he's talking

176
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,628
How did all this happen?
- A lorry...

177
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,300
You know the consequences of
interfering with the law?

178
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:08,149
How did all this happen?

179
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,994
How did it happen?

180
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,232
l was asking how it happened

181
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,173
We were walking along the highway.
A lorry hit me

182
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:37,512
You didn't take the number, did you?

183
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:45,009
And your friend was with you, right?

184
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:52,182
l'm not surprised. Wherever he goes,
accidents keep happening

185
00:29:54,563 --> 00:30:00,365
Hey, you have lovely eyes.
Don't misuse your eyes

186
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:05,540
This thing you keep doing...

187
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:09,203
Some day l'll make it
a permanent fixture on your face

188
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:31,566
Why did you make me tell a lie?

189
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:38,904
We've met twice.

190
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:45,239
And both the times,
you saved my life

191
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:53,585
lf you reciprocate
my friendship,...

192
00:30:54,623 --> 00:30:59,754
you will tell me
- Friend, you know nothing about me

193
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,430
l'm a convict. l've served
three and a half years

194
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,003
After l was released...

195
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:15,099
Vikram and his sister gave me
a huge advance to do a job

196
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:21,947
For Sheila's sake,
l decided to give up crime.

197
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:24,619
Else l would've lost her

198
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:31,286
l just burnt all the money.
So l couldn't give the money back

199
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:35,456
Nor did l do the job

200
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:40,625
Ever since, they've been after me.
By some freak chance...

201
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:45,969
you've struck an enmity with them too.
Had l not come in the nick of time...

202
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:53,309
last night they would've cut
your legs, made you a cripple

203
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,478
Before he left, the bastard
even threatened...

204
00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:01,652
to kill you,
Tina and Sheila....

205
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,651
unless l do the job

206
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:12,322
Rajesh, l'm grateful
for your friendship

207
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,329
Pray that l recover soon

208
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:28,673
l'll teach that cur a lesson.
He will pray for his death

209
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:43,194
Curse that chap who
made me take that fall!

210
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:48,031
Nurse, l fell down all the way
from the third floor

211
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,933
You fell in the bathroom!

212
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:56,203
Don't insult me in
front of the nurse

213
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:58,379
Whose wife are you?
The neighbors'?

214
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:03,107
You don't go groping another woman
in front of me! Aren't you ashamed?

215
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:05,220
l can always use
the other hand on you

216
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:09,883
You know, that's a pretty nose

217
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:14,551
Slowly! Are you pulling a stretcher
or a racing cart?

218
00:33:14,763 --> 00:33:19,223
Who's to answer if l get more
fractures? Slowly. Do it slowly

219
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:28,576
Nurse, where were you born?
At home, or in the hospital?

220
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:31,746
What a smile!

221
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:34,744
Hi handsome! What happened?
How did you get so many bruises?

222
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,419
What happened to him?
- Handsome, won't you speak to me?

223
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,749
The hoods! Hey you fellows are hoods.
Stay away from my wife

224
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,591
Move it man!

225
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:52,433
Now what's wrong?
Get a hold on your temper, darling

226
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:57,594
To hell with it! My name is Rustom!
l'll teach the hoods a lesson

227
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,598
You want to ruin my married life?

228
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:04,775
The other day, you threatened me.
Now you see?

229
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,941
My men have broken your bones!

230
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:11,109
What? Are you crying?
Or are you laughing?

231
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,788
Where were you when
they broke his bones?

232
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:17,785
No jokes, mind you.
l have a dozen goons waiting outside

233
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:22,286
So don't you talk too much,
or l'll break all your bones

234
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:24,365
And l'll put you on a bed
beside him. Get it?

235
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:28,801
This is a hospital.
Not your father's house

236
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:31,472
Shut up! lf l die,
you'll become a widow

237
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:35,309
Hasn't let go yet? Doctor!
Look, he's still holding on

238
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:35,596
Tina is missing!

239
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:39,399
What are you saying?
Where has she gone?

240
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:42,436
l don't know! lt's been some time now.
l've looked everywhere for her

241
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:47,100
This is Vikram! l'll kill him!
- Amar! Wait

242
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:51,878
Don't be hasty. lt could cost
you and Tina your lives

243
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,948
l'll kill everyone in his family!
Get out of my way

244
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,539
Don't be stubborn, Amar!
- Out of my way

245
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,965
The man in the mask. Unmasked now.
Put these handcuffs on

246
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,819
Don't tell lnspector Khan anything

247
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:40,991
Lord! Help me!

248
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:06,680
He has come alone.
Why hasn't Rajesh come?

249
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:10,024
He will come. After this one dies

250
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:14,852
- Vikram, where's my daughter?
- With me. Come and take her

251
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:32,042
Pump him full of bullets

252
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:37,883
Let him get closer. lt'll be fun
watching him die from close up

253
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,429
Stop!
- Let me go, Rajesh!

254
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,795
Come to your senses, Amar
What use dying for nothing?

255
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,058
They are the ones who will die

256
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,402
l'll kill each
and every one of them

257
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:56,470
Let go

258
00:38:57,606 --> 00:38:59,073
You think Tina means nothing to me?

259
00:39:00,175 --> 00:39:03,406
They want me to steal for them.
l'll do it for them

260
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:05,479
No! You won't

261
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:11,412
l have a plan. Just give me a day.
l'll get Tina out of here

262
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:17,592
One minute

263
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:44,905
Greetings, Khan Baba!

264
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:48,405
Where have you been so long?

265
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,248
Khan Baba,
this is my friend, Amar

266
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:59,413
l've something important to ask.
- Anything for you

267
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:08,593
Why Britain only?
l can even send you to the moon

268
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,098
Sit down, and have fun

269
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,632
Khan Baba, are the two birds here?
- Birds?

270
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:52,800
Amar and Rajesh.
- They came, and they flew away

271
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:58,976
Flew away? Or are they hiding here?
- How could they?

272
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:02,147
This is Karim Khan's house.
Not a pigeon coop

273
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,318
Sit down

274
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,956
Where are you going?

275
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:06,893
You dance very well

276
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:10,564
Thank you.
- lt's Allah's gift

277
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:31,585
Why have you come here?
- To tell you, you're going to die

278
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,188
l've heard those words before

279
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:38,755
Forgotten your time in jail?

280
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:42,922
Still haven't got
over your vengeance?

281
00:47:43,364 --> 00:47:45,332
That was my brother.

282
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:50,269
But a woman's vengeance,
you have not seen

283
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,274
When a woman takes her revenge,...

284
00:47:55,476 --> 00:48:00,106
everything is burnt to ashes

285
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:17,127
l'll call the police exactly at
five minutes to one

286
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:51,160
His plan is fantastic.

287
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:55,161
Sadly, he won't enjoy the fruits

288
00:48:55,703 --> 00:49:00,504
He's supposed to get 500,000
for the job

289
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:03,673
As soon as he delivers, we'll
give him five bullets instead

290
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:05,746
So our plan isn't that bad either

291
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:17,354
Look, you're mating tonight. Finding
three males for you was tough enough

292
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:20,690
Choose your mate.
Show them what you are

293
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,934
He's coming. Watch out

294
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:52,445
He must be dead
before he gets too close

295
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:04,127
How did they turn up?

296
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:08,201
He's shot

297
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:27,981
Lord, thou art the giver of life.
Give life, Lord

298
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:31,224
Rise, son

299
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:40,997
Fantastic plan, Rajesh!
They wanted to kill you

300
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:46,338
Khan Baba, it's all thanks to you.
- Fools! Took my men for real cops

301
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,838
They ran

302
00:51:48,943 --> 00:51:50,911
Come on. Amar must be waiting

303
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:02,651
The house in front of mine
is being burgled

304
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:06,693
Where?
- 7th floor. Riviera, Nariman Point

305
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:10,022
Your name? lt's important
- Now don't involve me.

306
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:12,199
l'm informing you. That's all

307
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,862
Have you called the police?
- Yes

308
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,199
We've made tons of money
This is worth 10 million. Take this.

309
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:25,704
Karim Khan is waiting for you.
He'll put you on the plane

310
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,710
What are you thinking about?
- l'm not leaving you. Come along

311
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:30,884
Not again!
- Rajesh, listen to me

312
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:33,713
You needn't go to jail.
This money is enough for us

313
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:36,722
We can live peacefully
anywhere on earth

314
00:52:37,124 --> 00:52:41,561
Not until the police are convinced
that l'm not involved with this heist

315
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,556
l have to get caught on this job

316
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:45,732
Amar, at most it's a matter of
a year or a year and a half

317
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:49,062
The police are coming

318
00:52:49,437 --> 00:52:52,065
Make sure you remember the codes
for the rendezvous with Joe?

319
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,071
Yes. Friendliness is godliness

320
00:52:57,611 --> 00:53:00,580
What am l going to tell Sheila?
- Explain it to her

321
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:20,099
You...?
- Yes, inspector

322
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:28,267
Getting caught while robbing
gets you one year

323
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:38,115
6 months more, going by my past record
makes it a year and a half?

324
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:44,283
What are you thinking about?
Handcuffs please

325
00:53:46,494 --> 00:53:48,462
That reminds me of a couplet
written by Mirza Ghalib

326
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,298
Would you like to hear it?
- Sure

327
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:57,627
Eagerness isn't without reason

328
00:53:58,172 --> 00:54:00,140
Where there is something to hide

329
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:01,965
What do you mean?
- Simple

330
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:08,312
Would you get caught doing such
a simple theft? Now that stinks

331
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:14,818
Stinks? But it's open and shut case.
- A policeman's first lesson is..

332
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:20,224
not to believe
what you see or hear.

333
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:22,989
Use your minds to find the truth

334
00:54:23,097 --> 00:54:27,329
After that, and only after that
can you believe

335
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,331
So what according to you
is the truth?

336
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:33,673
Allah willing,
l'll soon find out

337
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:56,352
l mention Allah,
and the truth outs

338
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:58,296
What truth?

339
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:04,700
Raka's house was robbed.
Diamonds worth 10 million are missing

340
00:55:05,406 --> 00:55:07,704
How am l involved with that?
- That's exactly what...

341
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:10,368
you're involved with.
This is a sham

342
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:16,039
You will never be able to prove
my involvement with that robbery

343
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:29,061
You're right. l can't arrest you
for the robbery

344
00:55:29,763 --> 00:55:33,062
But l can surely arrest you
for this murder

345
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:36,061
No! l didn't kill him

346
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:38,571
l say l haven't killed him

347
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:44,072
l'm beginning to
understand your plan.

348
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:49,075
You and your friend planned
this double heist

349
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:54,584
You were to rob Raka's house, and
you'd pass the loot to your friend

350
00:55:54,955 --> 00:56:00,086
And your friend flees lndia,
while you get caught here...

351
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:04,927
breaking a safe. You get a year
or a year and a half at most

352
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:10,426
After which, you and your friend live
happily ever after off the loot

353
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:14,763
You tried to fool the police.
But your friend has fooled you

354
00:56:14,975 --> 00:56:17,170
He kills this man,
and he gets away

355
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:18,901
That's a lie!
- That's the truth

356
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:23,109
My friend could never do that!
- That's exactly what he has done

357
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:26,782
He's flown with your money
and your girlfriend...

358
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:30,453
and your part of the deal
is to hang for him

359
00:56:30,658 --> 00:56:35,618
The hangman's noose for you, Rajesh
- My friend could never do that

360
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:58,808
ln crime, sons cheat their fathers.

361
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:02,651
What to say of friends?
Come on

362
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,838
Don't try to do the impossible.
Don't be foolhardy

363
00:57:20,374 --> 00:57:21,773
You can't escape

364
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:26,005
You can't get me.
Not until l've killed Amar

365
00:57:42,396 --> 00:57:44,364
Rajesh has double-crossed us.
- How come?

366
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:46,695
That police posse was a set-up

367
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:52,030
Where can he go?
- His friend! Joe

368
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:54,533
And Joe is in London just now

369
00:58:32,112 --> 00:58:34,410
My name is Joe
- Code?

370
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:38,251
Friendliness is godliness

371
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:46,084
Why hasn't Rajesh come?
Any problems?

372
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:48,254
No. He will come afterwards

373
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:53,258
Where's the jewelry?
- l have it

374
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:57,263
Has the money been organized?
- Will be done

375
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,940
Call me on this number
the day after tomorrow

376
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:18,617
Where's Rajesh?
- l don't know

377
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:21,118
Hasn't Amar told you?
- Who is he?

378
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:26,632
According to Scotland Yard,
you met Amar yesterday

379
00:59:31,171 --> 00:59:34,629
So what? Not a crime
meeting him, is it?

380
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:39,641
Yes, you have committed a grave crime.
Rajesh and Amar are criminals

381
00:59:40,514 --> 00:59:43,142
They are accused of
robbery and murder

382
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,320
Murder?
- Yes, murder

383
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:53,156
lf they turn themselves in, l can
get them off the hook for murder

384
00:59:54,194 --> 00:59:58,153
Only l know who the real killers are.
Vikram and his sister

385
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:04,998
But if they refuse, they'd get
twenty years at least

386
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:14,006
You might have to live those
twenty years in their company

387
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:23,015
Amar, something must've happened to
Rajesh. He should've been here by now

388
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,183
Nothing is wrong.
Believe me Sheila

389
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:31,360
Then why hasn't he come yet?
- He will come

390
01:00:32,232 --> 01:00:37,534
Whenever l ask you, that's all
you say. Where is he?

391
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:43,035
Something has cropped up.
He has had to stay back

392
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:48,541
What is it? Why don't you tell me?
- How do l explain this?

393
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:55,047
Sheila, as of now, l can't tell you
anything. But please, trust me

394
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:59,051
Amar, once you sacrificed your love
for my sake

395
01:01:00,427 --> 01:01:04,056
For the sake of that love,
tell me the truth

396
01:01:08,602 --> 01:01:10,229
lt will take him some time
to come

397
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,737
How long?
- A year or a year and a half

398
01:01:20,614 --> 01:01:25,415
Why just a year or a year and a half?
Why don't you say l'll never come?

399
01:01:26,053 --> 01:01:30,080
Rajesh, what are you saying?
- One more step, and you're dead

400
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:34,761
Surprised to see me alive?
- What are you saying?

401
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:39,762
May you live forever.
Why should l be surprised?

402
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:45,937
ls that meant for Sheila's benefit?
- You're raving! Are you drunk?

403
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:48,274
l'm just getting
out of the hangover.

404
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:53,443
Of love, friendship and humanity

405
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:55,176
What's wrong with you, Rajesh?

406
01:01:55,315 --> 01:01:57,613
Before he left he sent me
to the gallows

407
01:01:58,485 --> 01:02:00,453
Gallows...?
- Yes

408
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:04,786
By now l must've been sentenced
to hang. That's what you thought

409
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:08,952
To hang...?
- l have been framed for murder

410
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:11,958
Murder? Whose?
- Ask yourself

411
01:02:12,332 --> 01:02:16,132
No Rajesh! l didn't kill anyone.
- How come a dead man was there?

412
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:20,462
You killed him!
And you framed me for it

413
01:02:20,674 --> 01:02:25,976
So that l would hang! And you'd
enjoy all the money. And Sheila

414
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,648
Scoundrel! Why did you betray me?

415
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:33,319
l was willing to sacrifice a year
and a half of my life for your sake

416
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:36,819
lf you wanted the money,
you should've just said so

417
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:40,360
lf you wanted Sheila, l would've
sacrificed my love for your friendship

418
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,328
l would've stepped aside.
- lf you don't stop this nonsense...

419
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,829
l'm going to hit you!
- Just you try!

420
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:47,422
What are you waiting for?
- lf you were born of a man...

421
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:49,502
you'll throw that revolver away.
Then talk

422
01:02:58,545 --> 01:03:00,342
Rajesh, what's going on?

423
01:03:02,215 --> 01:03:04,342
Stop it, l say!
- Stay away

424
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:26,698
Rajesh! You mustn't!
- Out of my way, Sheila

425
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:07,910
For God's sake! Stop it

426
01:04:24,464 --> 01:04:28,264
lf the two of you don't stop
this madness, l'll kill myself!

427
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:34,941
Papa, l just had a nightmare

428
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:43,779
Who?
- Joe here

429
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:45,952
Yes, Joe? Rajesh here

430
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:47,481
When did you arrive?
- Just now

431
01:04:47,654 --> 01:04:50,623
The lnterpol and lnspector Khan
are looking for you

432
01:04:50,924 --> 01:04:53,449
l know. They think l committed
the murder

433
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:57,293
Not you. Vikram Singh and
his sister killed that man

434
01:04:57,597 --> 01:05:01,465
What are you saying?
- lnspector Khan told me himself

435
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:02,794
You are only charged with robbery

436
01:05:06,006 --> 01:05:08,304
Are you listening?
- Yes

437
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:10,975
Be careful.
- l will be careful

438
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:12,702
l'll contact you later

439
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:26,982
l have insulted your friendship

440
01:05:29,529 --> 01:05:34,489
l have hurt you
- Yes, you have hurt me

441
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,669
Go on Amar, kill me!
l have no right to live

442
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:49,512
You are the only friend l have.
lf l killed you, how could l live?

443
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:26,519
lnspector Khan.
With the London police

444
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:30,050
Amar, where's the heist?
- ln the boot of the red car

445
01:10:52,952 --> 01:10:58,652
We must switch cars. Khan must've
set all of London looking for us

446
01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:02,825
All right, you do the switch
while l call Joe

447
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:07,666
That car could be available

448
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:48,040
Why don't you say? We have to sell
the stuff. Where do we meet?

449
01:11:53,413 --> 01:11:58,214
The West London piers.
Eleven sharp

450
01:12:00,587 --> 01:12:04,045
The West London piers.
Eleven sharp

451
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:07,112
What is it Joe?

452
01:13:43,856 --> 01:13:47,314
Joe! You deceived me?

453
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,493
Your fate has deceived you.
Your life has deceived you

454
01:13:53,533 --> 01:13:56,991
Death surrounds you
on all sides

455
01:14:13,019 --> 01:14:17,353
Mr Joe, we have no enmity.
You may go

456
01:14:36,843 --> 01:14:38,811
That was just a sample

457
01:14:39,645 --> 01:14:42,546
Your friendship is now
going to be put to test

458
01:14:43,983 --> 01:14:47,714
Let's see if you can die together
as you have lived together

459
01:14:48,254 --> 01:14:52,213
Before you die, you can watch
the two of them die

460
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,599
l told you l wanted
to see you die together.

461
01:18:26,872 --> 01:18:28,271
Now is the time.

462
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:35,106
First you. Because you deceived us

463
01:18:51,163 --> 01:18:55,964
Such friendship!
Such sacrifice

464
01:20:19,585 --> 01:20:25,546
''Angels are not blessed so''

465
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:37,562
''This most human emotion''

466
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:49,237
''Only the richly deserving''

467
01:20:50,783 --> 01:20:55,914
''Will perform the supreme sacrifice''
