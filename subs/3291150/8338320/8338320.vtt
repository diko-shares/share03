1
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.439
Omar, what's the status
on the general?

2
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.379
No?

3
00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:30.758
Hamza.

4
00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:52.674
Where is General Fezzan?

5
00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:54.942
Tell me.

6
00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:14.321
I might be complicated,
but I ain't fucking hopeless.

7
00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.389
Is that what we call it?
Complicated?

8
00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:19.359
Well, whatever it's called,
it's not working, is it?

9
00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:22.530
Come on, Gina,
you're not looking
at the big picture.

10
00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:23.798
What's the big picture?

11
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:26.266
Is it you?
Are you my big picture?

12
00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.602
Oh, my God, thank you.

13
00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.237
You should get
the fuck over yourself.

14
00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:30.104
'Cause you know what
you actually are?

15
00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:31.304
A caveman.

16
00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.108
- You do resemble a caveman.
- You know what it is?

17
00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:36.010
-And you don't?
-You don't want competition.

18
00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:38.513
Gina, please, calm down.
That's what
your problem is.

19
00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:40.380
Me calm down?
Did you just tell me--

20
00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:42.717
Don't tell me
to fucking calm down!
I'm calm!

21
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.720
I've never been
more fucking calm in my life.

22
00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:47.955
"Oh, look at me.

23
00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:51.192
I'm English. I'm avoidant.
I don't like to argue."

24
00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.760
Well, guess what?

25
00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:55.263
I just want a little peace
in my life. Right?

26
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:56.931
-It'd be nice.
-I'm from America, bitch.
We're gonna fight about it.

27
00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:59.200
Go. Just go. Go.
So what does that make me?

28
00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:00.635
Does that make me stressful?

29
00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:02.402
No, no, no.

30
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:04.972
A little violent perhaps.

31
00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.742
I'm a professional.

32
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.710
Yeah. And a little violent.

33
00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:10.611
A little bit.

34
00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:12.180
Teeny bit.

35
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.514
You know what it is?

36
00:05:13.648 --> 00:05:15.315
I've got your skills
and then some.

37
00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:18.519
And neither of you like it
because you're both cavemen.

38
00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.855
She's talking to you.

39
00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:22.623
Actually, she's looking
in your direction.

40
00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:24.759
- I'm talking to you.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:26.027
But about you.

42
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.962
You might be my boss,

43
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.598
but I can tell that
you're also from this planet
called "hopeless"

44
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.034
where intimate relationships
and feelings

45
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:35.136
don't fucking exist!

46
00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.239
Fucking baby.
I've wasted so much
of my life on you.

47
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.473
You are a loser.
But I like you.

48
00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:43.811
Thanks.
Why are you here?

49
00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:47.480
I lost my ring at this bar,
and I need you to--

50
00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:50.918
I'm sorry. Is that it?
Are we done talking?

51
00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:53.154
Are you done
with this conversation?

52
00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:54.722
Conversation?

53
00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:57.390
It's more like
angry chatter.

54
00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:58.726
Fuck you.

55
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.629
She's talking to you
again.

56
00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:05.633
It's depressing.
No. It's okay.

57
00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:15.442
I liked her, Barney.

58
00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:19.113
She's an Expendable,
Christmas.

59
00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:23.383
Look, I got great respect
for your uncanny abilities.
I really do.

60
00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:26.354
But you are a selfish prick.

61
00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:27.822
Really?
We all are.

62
00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:30.191
We have to be
to choose this life

63
00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:31.959
over friends, over family.

64
00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:33.794
We do this for money.

65
00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:37.331
- That's the definition
of prickism.

66
00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:39.100
What do you think
of my analysis?

67
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.201
Pretty good?

68
00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:43.337
I think you're a moron.

69
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.639
You don't believe that.

70
00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:47.174
With every cell in my body.

71
00:06:47.575 --> 00:06:49.442
Why are we here?

72
00:06:49.577 --> 00:06:53.347
I lost my ring last night
in a bet, and I'm here
to try to buy it back.

73
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.414
Seriously?

74
00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:55.482
Yeah, seriously.

75
00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:57.084
A silly little trinket.

76
00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:00.655
I'm superstitious about it,
and I like it.

77
00:07:00.788 --> 00:07:02.790
Feel like
I'm missing a finger.

78
00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:08.362
I tried getting it back,
but this half-ass
won't negotiate.

79
00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.430
Who?
Jumbo Shrimp.

80
00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:11.966
Who's he?
You'll see.

81
00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:14.702
-What's up, Barney?
-Hey, Billy.

82
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:20.875
So how'd you lose
your most prized possession?

83
00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:23.778
Thumb wrestling.

84
00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:26.047
You mean arm wrestling?
No.

85
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.348
I mean thumb wrestling.

86
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.417
Like that.
Give me your hand.

87
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.185
No. Thumb wrestling?

88
00:07:31.953 --> 00:07:33.486
You used to be strong.
What happened?

89
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.290
And you used to be hairy.
What happened?

90
00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:37.992
Things change.

91
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.459
What's up, Barney?
Hey, how you doing?

92
00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:40.995
Jumbo Shrimp around?

93
00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:42.730
Is there a problem?

94
00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:45.700
- My friend wants his ring back.
-  -Mm-hmm.

95
00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:48.736
Bet's a bet, man.

96
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:50.771
You know, no offense,
but I'm missing my ring.

97
00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:52.472
It stays where it is.

98
00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:57.812
That's unacceptable.

99
00:07:58.379 --> 00:07:59.847
Striking resemblance.

100
00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:03.517
That's brutal.

101
00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.055
-These the guys, Barney?
-Yeah.

102
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.091
Now I see
why they call him Jumbo.

103
00:08:10.224 --> 00:08:13.427
- No, the other guy, second guy.
- Oh.

104
00:08:14.095 --> 00:08:16.697
You lost
to Santa's helper?

105
00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:19.200
That's embarrassing.

106
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.434
I was drunk.

107
00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:22.536
Well, you're not drunk now.

108
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.038
Why the fuck am I here?

109
00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:27.508
I hurt my back.

110
00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.110
Since when?

111
00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:31.278
A few weeks ago.
I can't even lift a fork.

112
00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:33.147
I would do it for you.
But if you don't want
to do it, I understand.

113
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.382
If you're intimidated...

114
00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:35.750
Intimidated?

115
00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:37.251
Hey, Lee.

116
00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:39.220
Make it easy on yourself.

117
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:41.689
The classics.

118
00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:43.724
I got this, Thumbo.

119
00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:45.993
Beer, please.

120
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:49.230
How you doing this nice day?

121
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.870
What do you prefer
to be called,
"Jumbo" or "Shrimp"?

122
00:09:01.442 --> 00:09:02.943
Call me that again.

123
00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:05.514
Cut your fucking head off.

124
00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:09.216
That's a little harsh,
bite-size.

125
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.185
Barney wants his ring back.

126
00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:12.553
What did you call me?

127
00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:14.922
How much for it back, Yoda?

128
00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:16.390
Hey!

129
00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:18.325
It stays here, asshole.

130
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.732
My back.

131
00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.470
You see,

132
00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.573
what we have here
is a matter of humiliation
and human kindness.

133
00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:36.710
My friend here loves his ring
for all of his stupid reasons.

134
00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:38.412
And it would be very nice
and civilized

135
00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:40.948
if you gents would
understand that principle.

136
00:09:41.082 --> 00:09:43.117
But since you choose to be--

137
00:09:44.652 --> 00:09:46.087
Barney, what's the word?
Obstinate.

138
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.254
Too long.

139
00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:49.056
Dumbbells.

140
00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:51.058
Dumbbells.

141
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:54.795
You leave me no other choice,
dinky.

142
00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:08.209
-You're welcome.
-You're slowing down.

143
00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:11.846
My turn, bitch.

144
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:18.819
Come on, chuck.
Come on, cowboy. Bring it.

145
00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:28.796
Get him a beer
when he wakes up.

146
00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:34.835
You almost killed me.

147
00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.905
I thought you had a bad back.

148
00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:40.341
You know, it's a miracle.
It just went away.

149
00:10:40.474 --> 00:10:43.844
You know, I really didn't need
this lovefest.

150
00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:46.480
I like spending time
with you.

151
00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:52.153
Next time,
take me on a pony ride, okay?

152
00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:57.825
Okay.

153
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:16.377
Overwatch, what is the status?

154
00:11:18.613 --> 00:11:21.550
Sir, there are three soldiers
guarding the general.

155
00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:22.783
<i>You're gonna need backup.</i>

156
00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:25.085
<i>I repeat, wait for backup.</i>

157
00:11:30.592 --> 00:11:32.059
What the fuck is he doing?

158
00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:34.328
No, no, no.
No, no, please. Please, don't.

159
00:12:01.789 --> 00:12:03.857
What's up, General?

160
00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.369
Are my eyes deceiving me?
Why?

161
00:12:15.503 --> 00:12:18.607
What's that thing
on Gunner's head?

162
00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.508
It looks like a sick cat.

163
00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:22.943
Cats are cute.

164
00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:25.346
That looks like tumbleweed.

165
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:28.382
Hey, good evening, big man.

166
00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:31.051
Let's talk.
What's that thing
on your head?

167
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:32.987
Oh, the wig?

168
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.256
Yeah, the wig.
Question is, why?

169
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:37.324
Well, I was chatting
with this girl on the Internet

170
00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:39.594
and she likes
that '70s look, you know.

171
00:12:39.728 --> 00:12:40.761
The Farrah Fawcett thing.

172
00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:42.930
Got it. You met her yet?

173
00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:46.033
Why-- Why would I do that?
I like the mystery.

174
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:47.901
- Understand?
-  Yeah, that makes sense.

175
00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:49.370
Sounds special.
It does.

176
00:12:49.504 --> 00:12:51.238
I liked him better
when he was a drunk.

177
00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:52.707
I know what you mean.
Me too.

178
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.275
I'm happy for you.

179
00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:00.180
Hey, is this the new guy?

180
00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:02.916
Hey, it's Easy Day.

181
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.852
Good man. Ex-special forces.

182
00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:07.254
-Hey, Barney.
-Hey, Easy.

183
00:13:08.022 --> 00:13:09.624
This our sniper?

184
00:13:09.758 --> 00:13:13.360
Don't worry about it.
I got a prescription scope.

185
00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:15.062
What?

186
00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:16.864
Well, Hawkeyes,
remember this face.

187
00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.432
Don't shoot it by accident.

188
00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.503
You don't have to worry
about me.

189
00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:22.637
Who's this guy?

190
00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:24.171
You're slipping, pal.

191
00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.173
You hired him.
That's Galgo's son.

192
00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:29.443
I have the eyesight,
the heart and the sex drive
of my father.

193
00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:31.445
Tell me he doesn't talk
as much as his father.

194
00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:32.813
He's worse.
No.

195
00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:34.014
Twice as bad.

196
00:13:34.148 --> 00:13:35.916
It's gonna be a long trip.

197
00:13:36.618 --> 00:13:38.385
I am Galan.

198
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.655
That suppose
to mean something?

199
00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:44.892
It's supposed to mean
a little something.

200
00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:47.562
All right,
cut the bullshit.
All eyes on me.

201
00:13:47.696 --> 00:13:48.630
Who's the suit?

202
00:13:48.763 --> 00:13:50.598
His name is Marsh.

203
00:13:50.732 --> 00:13:52.399
I did a few things with him
before I met you.

204
00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:55.402
He's CIA.
Hey, Barney, how you doing?

205
00:13:55.537 --> 00:13:56.671
How you doing, Marsh?

206
00:13:56.805 --> 00:13:58.038
How they hanging?

207
00:13:58.673 --> 00:14:00.007
Gravity's setting in.

208
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:02.510
Welcome to the club.

209
00:14:02.644 --> 00:14:04.579
As much as I would like
to exchange pleasantries
with you guys,

210
00:14:04.713 --> 00:14:06.648
there's a pressing matter
at hand.

211
00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:09.116
Meet Suharato Rahmat.

212
00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:11.452
Former British national
turned arms dealer.

213
00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:13.253
He has his own private army
and he's been hired

214
00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:15.824
to steal some detonators
for nuclear missiles

215
00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.592
for a very dangerous client.

216
00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:20.628
Word on the street is
the client's name is Ocelot.

217
00:14:20.762 --> 00:14:22.296
Hmm.

218
00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:24.599
Now, those detonators
get in the hands of Ocelot,

219
00:14:24.733 --> 00:14:27.602
he's planning on using them
to create
an international incident.

220
00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:29.637
We can't let that happen.

221
00:14:30.605 --> 00:14:32.940
So that's where
you guys come in.

222
00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:36.410
Your landing zone is Qaddafi's
old chemical war plant
in Libya,

223
00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:38.713
which I hear is very nice
this time of year.

224
00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:42.517
Your mission is to make sure
the detonators stay there.

225
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:43.884
All right?

226
00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.653
That's all I got.
Good luck.

227
00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:47.488
Barney, keep 'em tucked.

228
00:14:47.622 --> 00:14:49.056
I'll do my best.

229
00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:53.994
Operation Ocelot.
Mm-hmm.

230
00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:55.830
When were you gonna tell me?

231
00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.165
When you stopped
playing footsies
with your girlfriend.

232
00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:06.373
Hey, why's Christmas so pissed
about this Ocelot mission?

233
00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:09.511
He's just being Christmas.

234
00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:12.312
- Copy that.
- He knows Barney very well.

235
00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:15.916
He knows exactly how far
he's willing to go
to end Ocelot.

236
00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:18.252
Who the hell
names himself Ocelot?

237
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.655
Years ago,
the CIA hired Barney

238
00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:24.124
to find out
who code name "Ocelot"
actually is.

239
00:15:24.258 --> 00:15:27.729
He was close
when somebody walked him
into an ambush

240
00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:30.097
and nearly killed
his entire team.

241
00:15:30.598 --> 00:15:31.866
Damn.

242
00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:33.802
Yeah, some would say
Ocelot's a ghost

243
00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:37.438
that Barney created
to cover his own ass
for a mistake.

244
00:15:37.572 --> 00:15:38.907
No fucking way.

245
00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:42.476
Ocelot exists and Barney
will bury him someday.

246
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:45.747
What the fuck happened
to your ear, man?

247
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.849
I'm glad you asked me that.

248
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:52.186
I wrestled in college.
Common affliction in that sport
is contusions to the ear.

249
00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:55.657
Small pocket of blood
that separates the skin
from the cartilage.

250
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.535
Come on, big bird.

251
00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:15.710
Get up there,
you deathtrap.

252
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:17.411
Don't insult it.

253
00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:27.287
We have
a successful liftoff.

254
00:16:34.194 --> 00:16:36.430
Maybe it was
my first ménage à trois.

255
00:16:36.564 --> 00:16:40.234
You know. You know, Toll Road,
what I'm talking about, right?

256
00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.370
Hey.

257
00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.740
You know what is
a golden shower?

258
00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:49.577
It's when the woman, she--

259
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:52.714
<i>she squats down on top of you</i>
<i>and releases her bladder.</i>

260
00:16:52.847 --> 00:16:54.047
<i>It's very liberating.</i>

261
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.049
Wow, a world-class pervert.

262
00:16:56.183 --> 00:16:57.585
You know what is
a golden shower?

263
00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:59.988
You look like the type
who has had one before.

264
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.789
I'm cutting these losers.

265
00:17:01.923 --> 00:17:05.660
I heard too much of that.
It's tune time.
Time for music.

266
00:17:08.262 --> 00:17:09.496
It's ancient.

267
00:17:09.931 --> 00:17:10.865
It's soothing.

268
00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:12.466
Soothing?
Yeah.

269
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.234
Yeah, maybe.

270
00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:17.371
You know I had
a panic attack last night.

271
00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:19.974
Did you really?
Are you sure?
Yeah.

272
00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:21.441
Like your skin
starts to crawl?

273
00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:23.477
Your heart is beating?
You know it.

274
00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:26.079
Just take some Xanax
and pretend you're happy
with your life.

275
00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.649
I am happy.

276
00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:30.985
By the way,
you're the worst doctor, ever.

277
00:17:31.853 --> 00:17:34.254
Maybe it's Gina
who's making you anxious.

278
00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.390
She actually relaxes me.

279
00:17:36.524 --> 00:17:38.760
It's this-- this-- The job.

280
00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:40.360
No.

281
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:42.329
Some guys are just not meant
for companionship.

282
00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:44.398
Face the facts.
Wrong.

283
00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:47.267
Maybe you want to die
a bitter old sod,
but not me.

284
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.537
I want to be cheerful, happy.

285
00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:53.440
But I will come visit you
in the home.

286
00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:55.777
-Promise?
-Scout's honor.

287
00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.747
Let's see
what's going on.

288
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:01.081
<i>One of them was covering me</i>
<i>in hot candle wax.</i>

289
00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:02.382
Forget it.

290
00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:10.123
Where are the detonators?

291
00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:11.526
Never!

292
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.093
Your wife.

293
00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:15.429
Not my wife.
No, <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

294
00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:18.098
Your son is next.

295
00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:20.768
P-Please, not my son.
Please.

296
00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:22.904
Give me the detonators,
and I'll make it quick.

297
00:18:23.037 --> 00:18:24.271
My son, Adam...

298
00:18:24.404 --> 00:18:26.139
This is a fact
you cannot change.

299
00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:28.175
Give me the detonators or...

300
00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.443
Not my son.

301
00:18:29.577 --> 00:18:30.645
Your choice.

302
00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:32.013
Okay. Okay.

303
00:18:32.647 --> 00:18:34.181
They are in control room.

304
00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:36.283
The code to the safe
is...

305
00:18:37.852 --> 00:18:39.087
eight,

306
00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:40.354
one,

307
00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:41.455
four,

308
00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:42.624
two...

309
00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:44.525
seven.

310
00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:46.393
Wise choice.

311
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.430
Let's wake up the kids.

312
00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:52.499
Ready?
Yep.

313
00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:13.588
Where'd that come from?

314
00:19:14.287 --> 00:19:15.890
Ah, this is gonna be fun.

315
00:19:16.024 --> 00:19:18.526
- <i>LZ's hot.</i>
- Here we go.

316
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.429
-Incoming!
-Flak!

317
00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:29.037
<i>Intel was off.</i>

318
00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:30.437
Get creative!

319
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:31.739
Got it.

320
00:19:33.007 --> 00:19:34.307
Touch and go.

321
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:35.910
Okay, rally up. Rally up.

322
00:19:36.044 --> 00:19:37.377
Am I driving lead?
Nah.

323
00:19:37.512 --> 00:19:39.312
Take Gunner to overwatch
and fall in.

324
00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:48.255
Touch!

325
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.864
Happy hunting.

326
00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:04.404
Check it out.
There's something happening
at the weapons plant.

327
00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:05.673
We're on it.

328
00:20:10.178 --> 00:20:13.081
<i>I count four vehicles</i>
<i>and a lot of ops.</i>

329
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:14.982
Well, let's make less of them.

330
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.559
Sir, I have a new transport.

331
00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:25.727
Excellent.

332
00:20:26.493 --> 00:20:27.962
Tell Ocelot we have them.

333
00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:29.831
Let's go.

334
00:20:33.801 --> 00:20:35.002
In position.

335
00:20:36.037 --> 00:20:37.304
Load up!

336
00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:38.639
<i>Rahmat's got the detonators.</i>

337
00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:40.174
Gunner, you got eyes on them?

338
00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.643
Like crystal in headlights.

339
00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:50.618
Gunner, you're way off target.

340
00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:52.153
What do you need,
a seeing-eye dog?

341
00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:54.254
Damn spots.

342
00:20:57.024 --> 00:21:00.260
Hey, Stevie Wonder,
you might want to
get that prescription checked.

343
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:05.398
<i>Heads up.</i>
<i>Lee, where are you?</i>

344
00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:07.367
Looks like we're making
our entrance.

345
00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:09.070
Hold on to your <i>huevos.</i>

346
00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:11.639
Let's fly, baby!

347
00:21:20.248 --> 00:21:21.481
Whoo-hoo!

348
00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.354
Who the fuck is this now?

349
00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.557
<i>What do we do, boss?</i>

350
00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:31.793
Kill them.

351
00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.528
Open fire!

352
00:21:43.938 --> 00:21:45.907
Gunner, we could use some help!

353
00:21:50.278 --> 00:21:51.579
Six months sober.

354
00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:01.956
Now that's
what I'm talking about, Gunner.

355
00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:05.827
Can you lose them?

356
00:22:15.903 --> 00:22:17.605
-We're inside!
-Copy.

357
00:22:20.074 --> 00:22:21.374
Split up.

358
00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:23.578
Galan, we'll take point.

359
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:26.446
-You go after that squirter.
-Copy.

360
00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:38.159
Ooh.

361
00:22:39.426 --> 00:22:40.962
We lost the .50 cal.

362
00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:56.611
Pull up alongside him.

363
00:22:59.247 --> 00:23:00.214
Time to improvise.

364
00:23:00.348 --> 00:23:01.682
I can improvise.

365
00:23:15.563 --> 00:23:17.464
Gut shot. You'll live.

366
00:23:24.138 --> 00:23:25.206
Whoa.

367
00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:26.607
Maybe not.

368
00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:37.752
Galan,
what the fuck are you doing?

369
00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:39.387
I'm improvising.

370
00:23:51.464 --> 00:23:54.101
What's going on in there?
I need a status report now!

371
00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:58.438
One more and we're on Rahmat.

372
00:24:12.553 --> 00:24:13.955
What the fuck, Easy?

373
00:24:17.258 --> 00:24:18.926
Only easy day was yesterday.

374
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.027
Yep.

375
00:24:24.131 --> 00:24:26.934
Initial success
or total failure?

376
00:24:35.576 --> 00:24:37.411
Initial success.

377
00:24:37.545 --> 00:24:40.181
I'm out of ammo.
I'm coming in.

378
00:24:47.722 --> 00:24:49.123
You mean total failure.

379
00:24:55.429 --> 00:24:58.299
Christmas, where are you?
The detonators are compromised.

380
00:24:58.432 --> 00:25:00.668
<i>They're on the west side</i>
<i>heading north.</i>

381
00:25:03.237 --> 00:25:05.106
Don't let Rahmat leave
with those detonators

382
00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:07.675
or there's gonna be
a lot of dead people.

383
00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:13.147
Get in, losers!
We're going shopping!

384
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.249
You might want
to watch your six!

385
00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:19.720
Fire in the hole, fellas!

386
00:25:20.654 --> 00:25:22.056
Moving!

387
00:25:24.658 --> 00:25:26.060
Cover me!

388
00:25:26.627 --> 00:25:27.895
Incoming!

389
00:25:29.563 --> 00:25:32.533
Don't worry, my friend.
I would never leave you behind.

390
00:26:06.734 --> 00:26:08.169
I can't get the angle!

391
00:26:16.377 --> 00:26:18.913
<i>I'm out of flares.</i>
Damn it, Barney!

392
00:26:20.648 --> 00:26:22.517
Stay on mission, Christmas.

393
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.018
You're toast up there.

394
00:26:24.151 --> 00:26:26.087
Listen to him, man.
Get the detonators.

395
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.456
<i>Get the detonators, Lee!</i>

396
00:26:28.589 --> 00:26:30.024
That's an order!

397
00:26:32.193 --> 00:26:34.728
Fuck no.
I'm saving your dumb ass!

398
00:26:54.648 --> 00:26:56.016
You're welcome!

399
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.086
Nice work, man,
but who's on Rahmat?

400
00:28:07.888 --> 00:28:09.123
Holy shit.

401
00:28:35.216 --> 00:28:36.784
I miss him, man.

402
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.160
We miss you, Barney!

403
00:29:00.774 --> 00:29:02.611
Everybody listen up.

404
00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:04.745
There's an old expression.

405
00:29:05.647 --> 00:29:07.047
Beware an old man

406
00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:09.316
in a profession
where good men die young.

407
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.586
I'm sure Barney Ross has
had a seat reserved

408
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.488
at the big table up there
for some time now.

409
00:29:14.623 --> 00:29:16.423
And he earned that seat.

410
00:29:16.558 --> 00:29:18.560
He never stopped earning it.

411
00:29:18.693 --> 00:29:22.896
He brought the best out
in each and every one of us
because he was the best of us.

412
00:29:25.634 --> 00:29:26.934
To Barney.

413
00:29:27.067 --> 00:29:28.503
To Barney.

414
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.980
How are you?

415
00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:42.149
Great.

416
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:46.287
You don't gotta pretend, Lee.

417
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.923
You know Barney
wouldn't want to watch you
sulking like this.

418
00:29:50.725 --> 00:29:51.959
It's true.

419
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.295
Can I help?

420
00:29:57.898 --> 00:30:00.234
Well, since you're asking...

421
00:30:01.503 --> 00:30:02.537
I'd like--

422
00:30:05.472 --> 00:30:07.509
So when are we
going after the guys
that did this?

423
00:30:07.642 --> 00:30:10.344
You ain't going nowhere.
You're done.

424
00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:15.583
What's that mean?
You're off it.

425
00:30:15.717 --> 00:30:17.885
-You're done. You're out.
-Bullshit, Marsh.

426
00:30:18.018 --> 00:30:19.887
Who's gonna run
Barney's team?

427
00:30:24.458 --> 00:30:25.492
Gina?

428
00:30:29.063 --> 00:30:30.765
What is this,
a bad joke?

429
00:30:30.898 --> 00:30:32.767
Well, you disobeyed
a direct order
from your superior

430
00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.202
and that cost us the mission,
so you're out.

431
00:30:35.336 --> 00:30:37.505
-I was trying to save him.
-Well, you didn't.

432
00:30:37.639 --> 00:30:40.274
It's our play, it's our call.
You're out.

433
00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:44.311
It was Barney's sacrifice
to make, brother.

434
00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:47.214
Good death for the mission,
it would count.

435
00:30:47.348 --> 00:30:49.083
And you just took it from him.

436
00:30:49.216 --> 00:30:51.885
Made his sacrifice worthless.

437
00:30:58.459 --> 00:30:59.594
Christmas.

438
00:31:01.763 --> 00:31:02.996
Yeah.

439
00:31:06.066 --> 00:31:07.434
Thanks for the support.

440
00:31:10.572 --> 00:31:13.173
You certainly picked
your moment, pal.

441
00:31:28.322 --> 00:31:29.356
Oh.

442
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.126
Barney hated cover bands.

443
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.629
I'll be in touch.

444
00:31:35.663 --> 00:31:36.664
Hey.

445
00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:40.702
Nothing Barney did
was worthless.

446
00:31:40.835 --> 00:31:43.103
- You understand? Nothing!
- Hey. Easy, cowboy.

447
00:31:43.237 --> 00:31:44.639
Fuck you,
talking about Barney
in my face.

448
00:31:44.773 --> 00:31:46.641
This ain't the place
or time.

449
00:31:46.808 --> 00:31:50.210
<i>Por favor.</i>
Please, please.
<i>Tranquilo.</i>

450
00:32:08.897 --> 00:32:10.665
Pantry cook.

451
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.035
Hospitality director.

452
00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.938
Can be "hospitable-ish."

453
00:32:20.575 --> 00:32:25.145
Private security detail
for a social media influencer.

454
00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:37.391
I'm gonna go get a drink.

455
00:32:37.525 --> 00:32:39.026
We're about to go live.

456
00:32:39.159 --> 00:32:40.862
We're about to stream
this shit,

457
00:32:40.994 --> 00:32:44.131
and you girls look like shit.

458
00:32:44.264 --> 00:32:46.668
Uh, no. No.

459
00:32:46.801 --> 00:32:48.603
Buh-bye.

460
00:32:48.736 --> 00:32:52.172
- Hey, muscles.
- Get over here.

461
00:32:57.779 --> 00:33:00.013
Here, dude.
Hold my sign.

462
00:33:01.415 --> 00:33:03.083
Whoo!

463
00:33:03.217 --> 00:33:06.253
I'm your
private security detail.

464
00:33:06.386 --> 00:33:08.088
I'm here to protect you.

465
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.757
Not hold your sign.

466
00:33:10.892 --> 00:33:14.127
You see anybody
looking to do me harm?

467
00:33:14.261 --> 00:33:16.263
Potentially.

468
00:33:16.396 --> 00:33:19.066
Whatever.
Just hold the sign.

469
00:33:19.767 --> 00:33:22.135
"Potentially."
Double-O douchebag.

470
00:33:26.574 --> 00:33:28.843
What's up, motherfuckers?

471
00:33:28.977 --> 00:33:31.011
I'm here at my NOLA pad

472
00:33:31.144 --> 00:33:33.080
live streaming to you at home.

473
00:33:33.213 --> 00:33:34.649
Bringing a little
something-something

474
00:33:34.782 --> 00:33:37.184
into your pathetic
little lives.

475
00:33:37.317 --> 00:33:39.386
Look at these NOLA bitches.

476
00:33:39.521 --> 00:33:44.592
Which one-- No, which two
am I gonna fuck after?

477
00:33:44.726 --> 00:33:47.695
Oi. Have some respect
for the ladies.

478
00:33:47.829 --> 00:33:49.697
I am live streaming here.

479
00:33:49.831 --> 00:33:52.165
You guys believe this shit?
Look at this guy.

480
00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:54.636
Who does this motherfucker
think he is?

481
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:57.005
"Oi, respect the ladies."

482
00:33:57.137 --> 00:33:58.973
I'll respect them all right.

483
00:33:59.106 --> 00:34:01.141
Respect them enough
to let them lick the sweat
off my balls.

484
00:34:03.745 --> 00:34:05.345
Fuck, dude, my nose.

485
00:34:06.446 --> 00:34:10.384
Do you know how much money
I make off this face, asshole?

486
00:34:38.178 --> 00:34:40.080
Fuck it.

487
00:35:45.178 --> 00:35:47.882
Welcome home, love.

488
00:35:48.816 --> 00:35:50.350
You're lucky
I didn't shoot you.

489
00:35:50.484 --> 00:35:53.855
Probably.

490
00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:55.790
Hey, do you read now?

491
00:35:56.223 --> 00:35:57.659
What is this?

492
00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:00.662
Going somewhere, are we?

493
00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:03.330
We're going after the guy
that got Barney.

494
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.570
The only good thing
that came out of Barney's death
was the unsealing of that file.

495
00:36:09.704 --> 00:36:12.305
What the fuck
does that mean?
What's in here?

496
00:36:12.907 --> 00:36:14.474
Well,

497
00:36:14.609 --> 00:36:16.611
Barney was part of
a classified operation

498
00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:18.846
in between
international agencies.

499
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:23.117
And when it went south,
all the parties involved
decided to seal the file

500
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.987
until everyone
associated with it was dead.

501
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.389
So once Barney passed,
that file was declassified.

502
00:36:29.524 --> 00:36:32.560
It gave us a vital clue
on Ocelot's identity.

503
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.032
I want in.
I'm coming with you.

504
00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:39.567
Oh, I'm sorry.

505
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.402
You weren't invited.

506
00:36:42.537 --> 00:36:43.738
Oh.

507
00:36:43.871 --> 00:36:46.206
Well, won't you be lonely
without me?

508
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:48.375
No.

509
00:36:48.509 --> 00:36:50.545
There's lots of other boys
on the mission.

510
00:36:50.678 --> 00:36:51.713
Oh.

511
00:36:54.082 --> 00:36:55.683
I'm not in the mood.

512
00:36:55.817 --> 00:36:58.186
I'm gonna play
a little Hendrix.

513
00:36:58.318 --> 00:37:00.521
Usually does the trick.
Don't start.

514
00:37:00.655 --> 00:37:02.657
Oh, I'm starting.

515
00:37:05.893 --> 00:37:08.428
Oh, I always liked this tattoo.

516
00:37:08.563 --> 00:37:10.464
So did your brother.

517
00:37:18.506 --> 00:37:20.575
This was always my favorite seat
in the house.

518
00:37:20.708 --> 00:37:23.376
Well, these
and the cheap seats.

519
00:37:30.718 --> 00:37:33.054
You really need to be
more careful.
Mmm.

520
00:37:33.187 --> 00:37:34.488
Make me.

521
00:37:41.129 --> 00:37:43.430
Do an old soldier a favor.

522
00:37:45.499 --> 00:37:47.300
First things first.

523
00:38:06.687 --> 00:38:08.723
When I first met Barney...

524
00:38:10.591 --> 00:38:12.425
I was straight out of the SAS.

525
00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:16.831
Nothing to my name,
down on my luck.

526
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:25.039
He took a chance on me
when no one else would.

527
00:38:29.644 --> 00:38:32.479
We're gonna get the guy
that did this to Barney.

528
00:38:35.016 --> 00:38:36.483
I promise.

529
00:38:41.656 --> 00:38:43.858
I know I can't go with you.

530
00:38:46.794 --> 00:38:48.596
But I want you to take this.

531
00:38:56.904 --> 00:38:57.772
Well,

532
00:38:58.806 --> 00:39:01.441
I'll make sure
to give Rahmat your regards.

533
00:39:44.451 --> 00:39:45.820
You catch any of that?

534
00:39:45.953 --> 00:39:47.955
I don't know
what she's saying.

535
00:39:48.089 --> 00:39:50.892
-But why do you think
they call her Lash?
-I have no idea.

536
00:39:51.025 --> 00:39:54.128
But I'd love to find out.
She can lash me anytime.

537
00:39:55.263 --> 00:39:57.464
Oh, it's way bigger
than that, darling.

538
00:39:57.598 --> 00:39:59.267
No, no.
That's the Chinese bird.

539
00:39:59.399 --> 00:40:01.769
-We use the middle finger,
they use the pinky.
-Oh.

540
00:40:01.903 --> 00:40:04.805
But if the shoe fits...

541
00:40:05.606 --> 00:40:07.241
I was saying
what's up with your ears?

542
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:08.776
-My ear?
-Oh, shit.

543
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.112
Well, everybody knows
I wrestled in college.

544
00:40:11.245 --> 00:40:14.849
And a common affliction
in that sport is that you get
a contusion in the ear

545
00:40:14.982 --> 00:40:18.386
that separates the cartilage
from the skin and
creates a little pocket.

546
00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:20.221
I've had this one
drained nine times.

547
00:40:20.354 --> 00:40:22.023
I've never seen him so quiet.

548
00:40:22.156 --> 00:40:24.091
In essence, God gave me armor.

549
00:40:24.225 --> 00:40:26.961
He hasn't said anything
since Barney died.

550
00:40:27.094 --> 00:40:30.097
Now, I caught my roommate
talking shit about it one time.

551
00:40:30.231 --> 00:40:33.534
And I had to smack him
upside his head and give him
his own cauliflower ear.

552
00:40:33.668 --> 00:40:34.902
That's just the way it goes.

553
00:40:35.036 --> 00:40:37.605
You want to feel it? No?

554
00:40:37.738 --> 00:40:39.540
It's not contagious.
I promise.

555
00:41:20.281 --> 00:41:21.615
How you doing, friend?

556
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.652
I'm looking for Decha.

557
00:41:29.123 --> 00:41:29.991
Who?

558
00:41:30.958 --> 00:41:33.160
Ex-Task Force 90.
Thailand Special Forces.

559
00:41:33.294 --> 00:41:35.763
Supposedly owns a boat
that docks around here.

560
00:41:37.732 --> 00:41:39.700
Don't know anyone around here
like that.

561
00:41:39.834 --> 00:41:42.036
But if he have boat,

562
00:41:42.837 --> 00:41:46.140
boat down there,
not up here.

563
00:41:48.642 --> 00:41:50.044
Thanks for your help.

564
00:42:28.482 --> 00:42:30.351
Hey, excuse me, friend.

565
00:42:31.052 --> 00:42:33.020
You know the owner
of this boat?

566
00:42:34.523 --> 00:42:36.757
I'm looking
for a man named Decha.

567
00:42:38.659 --> 00:42:41.262
I'm sorry.
Decha has long gone.

568
00:42:41.395 --> 00:42:43.264
Oh, yeah? Where?

569
00:42:44.231 --> 00:42:47.668
To a place of peace.

570
00:42:48.269 --> 00:42:49.303
Dead?

571
00:42:50.137 --> 00:42:51.172
Ah.

572
00:42:52.073 --> 00:42:55.309
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of that going around.

573
00:42:58.779 --> 00:43:00.181
Excuse me.

574
00:43:00.314 --> 00:43:03.150
I can't let you
steal this boat, sir.

575
00:43:04.285 --> 00:43:05.686
What's it to you?

576
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:09.590
Just a boat.

577
00:43:10.191 --> 00:43:11.859
It's not yours.

578
00:43:14.462 --> 00:43:18.599
Hey, listen,
I'm taking this boat
with or without your permission.

579
00:43:23.938 --> 00:43:26.040
Why do you have
Barney's ring?

580
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:28.843
Barney's dead.

581
00:43:30.344 --> 00:43:33.481
And I need this boat
to get to the people
who killed him.

582
00:43:33.614 --> 00:43:35.483
I was looking for Decha.

583
00:43:35.616 --> 00:43:38.686
From what Barney said
about the man, I could
use him for what's ahead.

584
00:43:38.819 --> 00:43:40.321
Barney's dead.

585
00:43:44.225 --> 00:43:46.694
I was once Decha,
the man you seek.

586
00:43:47.328 --> 00:43:49.296
But I put that man
behind me.

587
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.600
If what you say is true,

588
00:43:51.732 --> 00:43:54.301
Barney should have
his revenge.

589
00:43:54.435 --> 00:43:56.170
Damn right, he should.

590
00:44:05.713 --> 00:44:06.947
Hey.

591
00:44:14.688 --> 00:44:16.323
Okay, listen up.

592
00:44:17.458 --> 00:44:20.194
The Thai cargo ship <i>Jintara</i>
was hijacked

593
00:44:20.327 --> 00:44:22.730
in the Andaman Sea
by our mutual friend Rahmat.

594
00:44:22.863 --> 00:44:24.633
The <i>Jintara</i>
has changed course

595
00:44:24.765 --> 00:44:28.269
and is tracking en route
to the Russian coast
of Vladivostok.

596
00:44:28.402 --> 00:44:31.305
Now, due to
that royal clusterfuck
that was Libya,

597
00:44:31.438 --> 00:44:34.308
Rahmat has taken possession
of the nuclear detonators.

598
00:44:34.441 --> 00:44:36.511
The ship itself
is gonna be hosting an exchange

599
00:44:36.645 --> 00:44:39.680
where they'll
be taking possession of
the remaining nuclear materials

600
00:44:39.813 --> 00:44:42.216
needed to construct
a viable bomb, nuclear type.

601
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:44.952
And we cannot let that happen.
Understood?

602
00:44:45.085 --> 00:44:47.221
Now, we also have
valuable intel
that says

603
00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:49.658
that Ocelot will be
on the <i>Jintara.</i>

604
00:44:49.823 --> 00:44:53.794
So this might be
our one and only chance
to learn of his true identity.

605
00:44:53.928 --> 00:44:55.896
-Or her.
-What's that?

606
00:44:56.665 --> 00:44:57.965
Could be a her.

607
00:44:59.568 --> 00:45:00.901
Or her identity, yes.

608
00:45:01.035 --> 00:45:02.537
And bring him or her in.

609
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:05.072
As you know, Barney's death
opened up a file

610
00:45:05.206 --> 00:45:07.676
that reveals the name
of a man who worked
with Ocelot.

611
00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:09.743
A witness
in witness protection.

612
00:45:09.877 --> 00:45:11.745
More on him from Russo.

613
00:45:12.547 --> 00:45:14.448
Name's Phen Lyong Bai.

614
00:45:14.583 --> 00:45:17.751
Ocelot's former partner
who'd love to rat Ocelot out.

615
00:45:17.885 --> 00:45:19.253
Snitches get stitches.
Right, Gunner?

616
00:45:19.386 --> 00:45:21.255
That's right.
Snitches get stitches.

617
00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:24.058
I don't have to tell you
how sensitive
this mission is.

618
00:45:24.191 --> 00:45:28.896
If the Russians get wind
that the US forces
are not only near

619
00:45:29.029 --> 00:45:30.699
but inside
Russian territory,

620
00:45:30.831 --> 00:45:32.601
it's a World War III
shit show.

621
00:45:32.733 --> 00:45:34.669
Understood?

622
00:45:34.802 --> 00:45:36.770
So that's why
this mission carries
no US signature whatsoever.

623
00:45:36.904 --> 00:45:38.540
Full deniability.

624
00:45:38.673 --> 00:45:40.975
If this goes bad, it's on you.
And one last thing.

625
00:45:41.108 --> 00:45:44.745
Since you Neanderthals
dicked up that last mission
in Libya without me,

626
00:45:44.878 --> 00:45:48.215
I'm gonna be coming along
to babysit you this time.

627
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:51.151
Now, won't that be fun?
Gina.

628
00:45:52.152 --> 00:45:54.755
All right, so the mission's
gonna go down like this.

629
00:45:54.888 --> 00:45:58.492
We're gonna run this assault
as a split team
with two separate objectives.

630
00:45:58.627 --> 00:45:59.893
We're gonna HALO in.

631
00:46:00.027 --> 00:46:01.295
Team Alpha's
gonna secure the bridge

632
00:46:01.428 --> 00:46:03.297
while Bravo searches
and sweeps the boat.

633
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.033
We're gonna identify,
kill-capture
both Ocelot and Rahmat,

634
00:46:06.166 --> 00:46:10.170
secure the detonators
and the nuclear components,
helo extract.

635
00:46:10.304 --> 00:46:11.839
Any questions?

636
00:46:14.842 --> 00:46:17.579
Is my delivery
a little different
than Barney's?

637
00:46:17.712 --> 00:46:20.281
He probably
would have just said,
"Let's go."

638
00:46:20.414 --> 00:46:21.516
Yeah.

639
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:22.916
Well...

640
00:46:23.551 --> 00:46:24.852
let's go.

641
00:46:32.326 --> 00:46:33.861
Is that an axe?

642
00:46:34.795 --> 00:46:36.430
No, it's a snow shovel.

643
00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:41.001
That makes sense.
Not for humanity,
but for you it makes sense.

644
00:46:47.074 --> 00:46:49.243
Hey. So what's your story?

645
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:53.447
Barney told me
you were ex-Task Force 90.

646
00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:55.316
Ultimate killer type.

647
00:46:55.449 --> 00:46:57.985
Never seen anyone faster
or better.

648
00:46:59.654 --> 00:47:04.024
There's only so many times
you can kill a man, Christmas.

649
00:47:04.592 --> 00:47:06.427
Each time,

650
00:47:06.561 --> 00:47:08.462
it gets easier.

651
00:47:08.596 --> 00:47:14.101
You become numb to pain,
to joy, and to love.

652
00:47:15.969 --> 00:47:18.172
With every person you kill,

653
00:47:19.006 --> 00:47:21.842
you lose
a little more of yourself.

654
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.581
I had to stop
before there was nothing left.

655
00:48:46.493 --> 00:48:48.962
Figured I'd be
using my axe by now.

656
00:48:54.134 --> 00:48:56.069
This is too quiet.
Something ain't right.

657
00:48:56.203 --> 00:49:00.274
Easy Day, Lash, you're with me.
The rest of you,
swing around port quarter.

658
00:49:00.407 --> 00:49:02.510
Where's port quarter again?

659
00:49:02.644 --> 00:49:06.180
I was Army.
We said left and right,
not port and starship shit.

660
00:49:06.313 --> 00:49:08.048
Starboard is right.

661
00:49:09.049 --> 00:49:10.984
Port, left. Quarter, back.

662
00:49:11.118 --> 00:49:12.687
Got it.
Let's move.

663
00:49:45.687 --> 00:49:47.822
Got a bad feeling about this.

664
00:49:47.956 --> 00:49:50.224
Yeah,
where the hell is everybody?

665
00:49:50.357 --> 00:49:52.627
The nuke
is definitely onboard.

666
00:49:55.262 --> 00:49:56.965
<i>All right, listen up.</i>
<i>Bad news.</i>

667
00:49:57.097 --> 00:49:59.567
<i>They already have uranium</i>
<i>with the detonators.</i>

668
00:49:59.701 --> 00:50:03.470
<i>There is now</i>
<i>an active nuclear bomb</i>
<i>on the ship.</i>

669
00:50:04.939 --> 00:50:06.641
We're about to
take the bridge.

670
00:50:18.051 --> 00:50:19.687
It's a ghost town in here.

671
00:50:20.387 --> 00:50:22.456
Go!
Put your weapons down now!

672
00:50:27.962 --> 00:50:30.464
What a fucking mess
this turned out to be.

673
00:50:31.098 --> 00:50:32.499
First Libya,
now this.

674
00:50:32.634 --> 00:50:34.802
Somebody knew we were coming.
Both times.

675
00:50:34.936 --> 00:50:36.303
My intel was solid.

676
00:50:36.436 --> 00:50:38.238
-Your intel was shit.
-Ah, shit on this.

677
00:50:38.372 --> 00:50:39.774
The intel
could have been leaked.

678
00:50:39.908 --> 00:50:42.276
-We don't know you.
-He was verified.

679
00:50:42.409 --> 00:50:44.444
Well, then maybe it was
your new girlfriend.

680
00:50:44.579 --> 00:50:46.046
Fuck you, Gunner.

681
00:50:46.179 --> 00:50:48.850
You sold us out in Vilena
on that mission.

682
00:50:48.983 --> 00:50:50.785
Think I'd forget about that?

683
00:50:50.919 --> 00:50:53.053
Somebody did
sell us out.

684
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:54.956
How about your man?

685
00:50:55.088 --> 00:50:57.190
You sold him out
so you could be on top.

686
00:50:57.324 --> 00:50:59.027
Back off.
She wouldn't do that.

687
00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:01.029
What? Fuck him on top?

688
00:51:01.161 --> 00:51:02.462
Fuck you.

689
00:51:02.597 --> 00:51:04.231
Maybe it's the mute
over in the corner.

690
00:51:04.364 --> 00:51:06.968
What's up, Galan?
Cat got your tongue, cowboy?

691
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.504
- Yeah, he's hiding something.
- Yeah.

692
00:51:09.637 --> 00:51:12.306
- I never trusted
this fucking guy.

693
00:51:23.818 --> 00:51:26.320
- Who's the leader?
- I'm the leader.

694
00:51:45.907 --> 00:51:47.107
Take him.

695
00:52:05.192 --> 00:52:06.493
Fuck.

696
00:52:07.862 --> 00:52:09.363
There she is.

697
00:52:11.899 --> 00:52:13.467
Go time.

698
00:52:18.039 --> 00:52:19.807
I'll go first.

699
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:21.743
Send down a signal
when it's clear
for you to follow.

700
00:52:21.876 --> 00:52:23.645
This is as far as I go.

701
00:52:24.779 --> 00:52:27.481
-I could use you.
-I can't.

702
00:52:28.148 --> 00:52:30.518
If I let the old me out,

703
00:52:30.652 --> 00:52:34.354
I don't know if I could ever
get him back in.

704
00:52:39.994 --> 00:52:41.261
I understand.

705
00:53:40.121 --> 00:53:41.956
Should be carnage up here.

706
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.458
Where are you guys?

707
00:53:46.493 --> 00:53:48.563
My shift's done.
Going downstairs.

708
00:54:05.213 --> 00:54:07.314
Don't move
and turn around.

709
00:54:07.782 --> 00:54:08.649
Slowly.

710
00:54:08.783 --> 00:54:10.383
Well, which one is it,
friend?

711
00:54:10.518 --> 00:54:13.487
Don't move
or turn around slowly?

712
00:54:14.222 --> 00:54:15.690
Turn around.

713
00:54:15.823 --> 00:54:16.858
Very slowly.

714
00:54:21.996 --> 00:54:23.898
Ah! Jesus Christ!

715
00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:26.934
Colin, you scared
the shit out of me,
you bellend.

716
00:54:27.068 --> 00:54:28.936
Colin?
Who the fuck is Colin?

717
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.372
Don't give me that.
Hey, you need to be
careful with that.

718
00:54:32.507 --> 00:54:34.709
That could go off
in your hand.

719
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:50.057
Perfect timing,
Mr. Marsh.

720
00:54:54.162 --> 00:54:55.062
<i>Marsh?</i>

721
00:54:55.196 --> 00:54:56.931
This mission was a trap.

722
00:54:57.064 --> 00:54:58.900
Somebody leaked our intel.

723
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:05.305
<i>My demands are simple.</i>

724
00:55:06.073 --> 00:55:07.642
<i>Prisoner exchange.</i>

725
00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:10.611
<i>I want your prisoner,</i>
<i>Phen Lyong Bai.</i>

726
00:55:10.745 --> 00:55:12.947
A dear friend of a friend.

727
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.115
If not,

728
00:55:15.149 --> 00:55:18.418
Mr. Marsh will be the example
of how deadly serious I am.

729
00:55:18.553 --> 00:55:21.722
So, what's it going to be,
Russo?

730
00:55:21.856 --> 00:55:24.357
I don't have the authority.

731
00:55:24.491 --> 00:55:25.993
I know you don't!

732
00:55:26.727 --> 00:55:29.964
But I know someone who does.

733
00:55:42.076 --> 00:55:44.712
Let's get the last
of the fake planes up.

734
00:56:04.932 --> 00:56:06.133
Rahmat,

735
00:56:06.767 --> 00:56:08.836
you sneaky little sausage.

736
00:56:14.675 --> 00:56:16.043
I can get you the authority.

737
00:56:16.177 --> 00:56:18.411
<i>Phen Lyong Bai</i>
<i>is in your lockup.</i>

738
00:56:18.546 --> 00:56:24.886
<i>Your contact is Donald Allman,</i>
<i>authorization 2-2-5-7-9.</i>

739
00:56:25.987 --> 00:56:26.988
<i>Good.</i>

740
00:56:27.121 --> 00:56:28.421
<i>And no funny business.</i>

741
00:56:28.556 --> 00:56:30.057
It's your call
whether the Expendables

742
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:32.894
need to live up
to their namesake or not.

743
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.712
<i>Bringing a little</i>
<i>something-something</i>

744
00:57:24.845 --> 00:57:27.081
<i>into your</i>
<i>pathetic little lives.</i>

745
00:57:27.214 --> 00:57:29.417
<i>Look at these bitches.</i>

746
00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:34.454
<i>Which one-- No, which two</i>
<i>am I gonna fuck after?</i>

747
00:57:34.588 --> 00:57:37.191
<i>Oi.
</i> <i>Have some respect</i> <i>for the ladies.</i>

748
00:57:37.325 --> 00:57:39.393
<i>I am live streaming here.</i>

749
00:57:39.527 --> 00:57:41.729
<i>You guys believe this shit?</i>
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

750
00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.168
<i>"...the ladies."</i>

751
00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:48.703
<i>I'll respect them all right.</i>

752
00:57:48.836 --> 00:57:49.804
<i>Respect them enough</i>
<i>to let them lick</i>

753
00:57:49.937 --> 00:57:51.038
<i>the sweat off my balls.</i>

754
00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:19.499
Huh.
This doesn't belong to you.

755
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:23.938
Where are my friends?

756
00:58:27.108 --> 00:58:29.443
Where are my friends?
Mm-mmm.

757
00:58:29.577 --> 00:58:31.412
Sir, we might have a problem.

758
00:58:31.545 --> 00:58:33.948
Paithoon and Takk
have gone dark.

759
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:38.719
Room 657, B-deck.

760
00:58:38.853 --> 00:58:40.554
Much appreciated.

761
00:58:42.056 --> 00:58:43.090
Ah.

762
00:58:45.526 --> 00:58:47.161
Gunner.

763
00:58:47.294 --> 00:58:49.864
<i>Takk?</i>
Don't mind if I do.

764
00:58:49.997 --> 00:58:53.534
<i>Report back, Takk.</i>
<i>We may have a rat onboard.</i>

765
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.836
<i>Check everyone's status.</i>

766
00:58:56.804 --> 00:58:58.072
<i>Takk?</i>

767
00:58:58.205 --> 00:59:00.241
Takk can't come
to the phone right now.

768
00:59:01.575 --> 00:59:02.977
He's a little limp.

769
00:59:05.746 --> 00:59:07.748
Who is this?

770
00:59:07.882 --> 00:59:10.684
<i>A man who made a mistake</i>
<i>letting you live.</i>

771
00:59:10.818 --> 00:59:13.721
- But I'm here to remedy that.
<i>- Ah.</i>

772
00:59:13.854 --> 00:59:16.557
Look who's still
trying to be a hero.

773
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.926
<i>How nice of you</i>
<i>to come aboard.</i>

774
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.563
<i>If you're hoping for</i>
<i>a redo of the mess in Libya,</i>
<i>you're too late, I'm afraid.</i>

775
00:59:22.696 --> 00:59:24.632
My men are on their way
to hunt you down.

776
00:59:24.765 --> 00:59:28.869
<i>So I guess it's up to me</i>
<i>to put you in an early grave.</i>

777
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:32.573
Just like I did your friend
in Libya.

778
00:59:33.974 --> 00:59:36.310
Correction.
He wasn't my friend.

779
00:59:36.877 --> 00:59:38.345
He was my brother.

780
00:59:38.479 --> 00:59:39.980
So you can bring your army.

781
00:59:40.114 --> 00:59:42.049
<i>Bring all the fucking men</i>
<i>you want</i>

782
00:59:42.183 --> 00:59:43.784
<i>and I'll work through</i>
<i>every last one of them.</i>

783
00:59:43.918 --> 00:59:45.686
<i>When I get to you,</i>

784
00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.855
I'll make sure
that the only way
you leave this ship

785
00:59:47.988 --> 00:59:50.891
is in a wonderful variety
of pieces.

786
01:00:33.535 --> 01:00:35.336
Don't shoot by the bomb!

787
01:01:41.936 --> 01:01:44.471
Pavel,
you have eyes on the rat?

788
01:01:45.773 --> 01:01:47.041
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Location?

789
01:01:47.174 --> 01:01:48.909
<i>Corridor, deck one.</i>

790
01:01:54.848 --> 01:01:56.417
<i>Deck two.</i>
What?

791
01:02:12.266 --> 01:02:14.768
<i>Officers' dining area,</i>
<i>deck three.</i>

792
01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:57.438
Rubber side down, mate.

793
01:04:07.448 --> 01:04:10.552
He's on the stern.

794
01:05:01.836 --> 01:05:03.170
What are you doing?

795
01:05:03.303 --> 01:05:05.239
Thought you were done
with this life.

796
01:05:05.439 --> 01:05:09.343
It would be disrespectful
to Barney's memory
to let his friend die.

797
01:05:10.712 --> 01:05:11.846
I like the look.

798
01:05:11.979 --> 01:05:13.213
Thank you.

799
01:05:13.347 --> 01:05:15.983
-Then let's get to it.
-Okay.

800
01:05:40.474 --> 01:05:42.309
Everything's sealed tight
down here.

801
01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:44.111
Yeah, these are
welded up solid too.

802
01:05:44.244 --> 01:05:45.446
Okay, so what's next?

803
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.047
Bilge system.

804
01:05:47.181 --> 01:05:49.049
What?
Bilge system.

805
01:05:49.183 --> 01:05:52.687
In emergencies,
it clears water
from the ship's dry areas.

806
01:05:52.821 --> 01:05:54.756
If you get it open,
it should let us out of here.

807
01:05:54.889 --> 01:05:57.491
Come on, man.
 Let's get this fucking thing open.

808
01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:59.561
Damn it.

809
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:04.799
-Well, that ain't budging.
-No shit. It's got to get wet.

810
01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:06.233
What?

811
01:06:06.366 --> 01:06:08.302
Wet. If it gets wet,
it'll open.

812
01:06:09.436 --> 01:06:12.406
- Well, anybody gotta pee?
- I gotta go.

813
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:15.677
I've had to piss
since we HALO'd in here.

814
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:26.386
A little privacy, please?

815
01:06:36.063 --> 01:06:37.665
The hyoid bone.

816
01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:42.871
It's the only bone
in the human body
not connected to any others.

817
01:06:44.004 --> 01:06:47.441
It's right here in the throat.
Without it, we cannot speak.

818
01:06:48.576 --> 01:06:50.612
With these hands,
I will claw the hyoid bone

819
01:06:50.745 --> 01:06:52.614
from the throat
of that fucker Rahmat,

820
01:06:52.747 --> 01:06:54.381
stick it up
his boyfriend's <i>culo,</i>

821
01:06:54.516 --> 01:06:56.283
then make both
of their asses apologize

822
01:06:56.416 --> 01:06:58.686
while they drown
in their own blood.

823
01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.922
Barney was my hero.

824
01:07:01.054 --> 01:07:02.891
I do not speak,
I cannot speak,

825
01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:07.361
because my mind is full
of these brutal,
visceral fantasies,

826
01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:11.465
fantasies that will now
become a hellish reality.

827
01:07:14.468 --> 01:07:16.704
You should go back
to not talking.

828
01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:28.016
-Done.
-Any takers?

829
01:07:28.148 --> 01:07:31.418
This will lead us
to the men
who killed Barney?

830
01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:33.721
Uh, yes.

831
01:07:33.855 --> 01:07:35.255
I will avenge him.

832
01:07:41.696 --> 01:07:44.197
Guess he does
like golden showers.

833
01:07:44.331 --> 01:07:47.735
Lyong Bai is en route to you
as we speak.

834
01:07:47.869 --> 01:07:51.873
<i>I expect to have my team</i>
<i>returned alive.</i>

835
01:07:52.006 --> 01:07:54.676
Of course.
For what is a man
without his word?

836
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:57.512
Prepare for exchange.

837
01:07:57.912 --> 01:07:59.146
Moving out!

838
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.550
-This way.
-Okay.

839
01:08:02.684 --> 01:08:05.085
Your friends
will be really happy
to see you, right?

840
01:08:05.218 --> 01:08:06.554
Probably not.

841
01:08:06.688 --> 01:08:08.856
Gina will have to admit
she needs me.

842
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.991
On three.
Yeah.

843
01:08:10.123 --> 01:08:11.358
Three.

844
01:08:13.828 --> 01:08:14.829
Nobody here.

845
01:08:14.963 --> 01:08:16.263
No shit.

846
01:08:16.396 --> 01:08:17.632
Where did they go?

847
01:08:20.167 --> 01:08:21.636
You smell piss?

848
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:23.503
Yeah.

849
01:08:23.638 --> 01:08:28.442
We're gonna stay quiet
until it's time to get loud.

850
01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:30.444
Okay, okay. Yeah.

851
01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:36.249
Get on the ground!

852
01:08:37.351 --> 01:08:38.786
Time to get loud?

853
01:08:42.122 --> 01:08:44.792
It's you
who needs to get down
on the ground, pal.

854
01:08:45.526 --> 01:08:46.728
Or what?

855
01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:53.200
Or get wasted
by an Expendable.

856
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:56.904
Don't tell me.
You're happy to see me.

857
01:08:57.038 --> 01:09:00.240
Technically, you're not
an Expendable anymore,
Christmas.

858
01:09:00.374 --> 01:09:01.843
Especially you.

859
01:09:01.976 --> 01:09:04.078
Such a pleasure.
Likewise.

860
01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:05.747
Great timing.
Easy Day.

861
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.314
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

862
01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:10.918
Is that my Traumahawk?

863
01:09:11.052 --> 01:09:12.587
Yeah.
How do you like it?

864
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.656
- Growing on me.
- What took you so long?

865
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:17.324
Did you think
that I was gonna believe

866
01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:19.694
you were actually
just gifting me your knife?

867
01:09:19.827 --> 01:09:21.896
You gifted her
your knife?

868
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:23.598
And they say
romance is dead.

869
01:09:23.731 --> 01:09:26.701
He put a tracker in it.
It was all part of the plan.

870
01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:29.369
Sorry.

871
01:09:30.237 --> 01:09:31.939
I feel a little used.

872
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.548
Okay, let's go.

873
01:09:40.682 --> 01:09:42.750
Hey, Gunner,
watch our six.

874
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.418
I like your hair.

875
01:09:44.552 --> 01:09:46.186
-Who's your new friend?
-Decha.

876
01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:49.090
Old friend of Barney's.
Kicks ass
with the best of them.

877
01:09:49.222 --> 01:09:51.191
Any friend of Barney's
is all right by me.

878
01:09:51.324 --> 01:09:54.294
Rahmat took Marsh.
Huh. I'm devastated.

879
01:09:54.428 --> 01:09:58.933
First things first.
Toll Road, I need you
to take a look at something.

880
01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:03.437
It's a big fucking bomb.

881
01:10:03.571 --> 01:10:05.707
With the detonators
that we didn't get.

882
01:10:06.339 --> 01:10:07.709
We're fucked.

883
01:10:07.842 --> 01:10:09.276
Can you elaborate?

884
01:10:09.409 --> 01:10:11.311
This thing's wired
to go in 27 minutes.

885
01:10:11.445 --> 01:10:13.681
It's tamperproof.
Got mercury switches.

886
01:10:13.815 --> 01:10:17.185
The only way we're shutting
this bad boy down is to find
the remote kill switch.

887
01:10:17.317 --> 01:10:18.418
That's the last line
of defense.

888
01:10:18.553 --> 01:10:20.188
Now, it's short range,

889
01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.824
so whoever has that
on their person
is on this fucking boat.

890
01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:24.257
- Rahmat.
- Rahmat.

891
01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:26.393
Who's Rahmat?

892
01:10:26.527 --> 01:10:28.096
Guy who killed Barney.

893
01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:30.665
We probably
just entered Russian waters.

894
01:10:30.798 --> 01:10:33.034
Dressing this ship to look like
a US aircraft carrier

895
01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:35.803
with a primed nuke
about to blow
off the coast of Russia.

896
01:10:35.937 --> 01:10:37.638
It's going
to start World War III.

897
01:10:38.472 --> 01:10:40.273
Clock is ticking.
Let's lock and load.

898
01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:42.476
New location, deckside.

899
01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:45.079
It's all about
this kill switch now.

900
01:10:45.213 --> 01:10:47.582
Switch off Rahmat
permanently.

901
01:10:47.715 --> 01:10:50.685
Well, can you make us
something loud and messy?

902
01:10:50.818 --> 01:10:52.954
Does the pope shit
in the woods?

903
01:10:53.087 --> 01:10:55.022
No, the pope don't shit
in the woods.

904
01:10:55.156 --> 01:10:57.825
Or next to a bear.
Why you gotta say shit
like that?

905
01:11:04.464 --> 01:11:05.700
What is that?

906
01:11:41.334 --> 01:11:42.369
Oh, shit! Bomb!

907
01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:21.542
Shit!

908
01:12:47.768 --> 01:12:48.903
Fuck it!

909
01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:58.546
You're welcome.
Huh.

910
01:13:01.515 --> 01:13:02.717
Don't mention it.

911
01:13:12.927 --> 01:13:13.961
Good to be back.

912
01:13:18.199 --> 01:13:19.399
I got you.

913
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.702
Thanks.

914
01:13:41.322 --> 01:13:42.590
Hey, <i>puta.</i>

915
01:13:59.573 --> 01:14:00.808
I got him.

916
01:14:18.326 --> 01:14:19.527
Toll Road!

917
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:22.596
Easy! Man down! Man down!

918
01:14:28.302 --> 01:14:29.904
Can you kiss that
and make it better?

919
01:14:30.037 --> 01:14:32.807
Maybe later.
I'm a little busy right now.

920
01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.675
I got him.

921
01:14:40.748 --> 01:14:43.250
Hey!

922
01:15:18.085 --> 01:15:19.954
<i>Ready for prisoner exchange.</i>

923
01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:21.889
<i>Three minutes</i>
<i>until we touch down.</i>

924
01:15:22.023 --> 01:15:23.724
Standing by for the exchange.

925
01:15:23.858 --> 01:15:25.726
<i>Proceed as planned.</i>

926
01:15:47.581 --> 01:15:49.183
How you doing, Rahmat?

927
01:15:50.418 --> 01:15:53.421
I see you like
to play with knives.
Well, I ain't playing no more.

928
01:15:53.554 --> 01:15:56.624
You're gonna give me
the kill switch,
and we're gonna end all this.

929
01:15:56.757 --> 01:15:58.659
Come and get it, hero.

930
01:17:10.798 --> 01:17:13.100
Is that the biggest one
you've got?

931
01:17:40.494 --> 01:17:41.530
Nah.

932
01:17:42.196 --> 01:17:43.565
That's the biggest one
I got.

933
01:17:50.572 --> 01:17:51.705
Lee, you good?

934
01:17:51.839 --> 01:17:53.073
Yeah.

935
01:17:58.547 --> 01:18:00.114
Where's the kill switch?

936
01:18:00.247 --> 01:18:03.717
You fucking idiot.
I don't have the kill switch.

937
01:18:04.885 --> 01:18:06.521
My boss has it.

938
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:10.724
Ocelot.

939
01:18:28.442 --> 01:18:29.944
Phen Lyong Bai is here.

940
01:18:30.077 --> 01:18:32.880
He's our witness
that can identify Ocelot.

941
01:18:41.989 --> 01:18:43.558
-Hello, Bai.
-Oh, my God, no.

942
01:18:43.692 --> 01:18:45.292
No!
Bye-bye, Bai.

943
01:18:53.367 --> 01:18:54.636
Marsh is Ocelot.

944
01:18:54.768 --> 01:18:56.337
He's had the kill switch
this whole--

945
01:18:58.739 --> 01:19:00.908
That's for Barney.

946
01:19:08.849 --> 01:19:10.417
How long until detonation?

947
01:19:11.018 --> 01:19:11.986
Twelve minutes.

948
01:19:12.119 --> 01:19:13.821
All right, we got 12 minutes

949
01:19:13.954 --> 01:19:16.056
before this ship blows up
like a Roman candl--

950
01:19:26.735 --> 01:19:29.837
Hey, Marsh.
I guess you won't be needing
that anymore.

951
01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:31.772
All right, Christmas!

952
01:19:31.905 --> 01:19:33.708
You're like genital warts!

953
01:19:33.841 --> 01:19:37.778
Always showing up
where you're not wanted
and refusing to go away!

954
01:19:37.911 --> 01:19:40.147
You got something I need,
Marsh.

955
01:19:41.081 --> 01:19:42.651
I'm coming down to get it.

956
01:19:42.783 --> 01:19:46.120
I guess you figured out
that this device right here

957
01:19:46.253 --> 01:19:48.556
is the only thing
preventing World War III,

958
01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:51.925
a conflict that,
while devastating for many,

959
01:19:52.594 --> 01:19:53.628
it'll be insanely,

960
01:19:53.762 --> 01:19:55.029
insanely,

961
01:19:55.162 --> 01:19:57.699
insanely profitable
for somebody.

962
01:19:57.831 --> 01:19:59.967
And that somebody
is gonna be me.

963
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:03.504
And the Expendables
will take all the blame!

964
01:20:03.638 --> 01:20:05.507
So, enjoy the show!

965
01:20:08.909 --> 01:20:10.545
Kill them all!

966
01:20:10.679 --> 01:20:11.845
Take cover!

967
01:20:14.716 --> 01:20:16.016
Everybody get down!

968
01:20:19.688 --> 01:20:22.089
We need to get clear
of this boat
or we're all gonna get fried!

969
01:20:22.222 --> 01:20:24.391
Jumping overboard
is seeming like
a decent plan right now.

970
01:20:24.526 --> 01:20:28.062
We'll never make it out
of the blast zone.
We'll never make it in time.

971
01:20:31.533 --> 01:20:34.536
- Hey, man, you're not
going down on my watch.

972
01:20:36.003 --> 01:20:38.205
We gotta move.
He's bleeding out.

973
01:20:39.073 --> 01:20:40.341
I got an idea.

974
01:20:40.474 --> 01:20:43.611
We can take my boat.
It's being towed.

975
01:20:43.745 --> 01:20:45.045
That's a great idea.

976
01:20:45.179 --> 01:20:46.581
Next time,
let's start with that!

977
01:20:46.715 --> 01:20:48.315
Yeah!

978
01:20:48.449 --> 01:20:49.917
Gunner, give us cover fire.
We're on the way out.

979
01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:52.252
Copy that.
Cover fire.

980
01:20:57.525 --> 01:21:00.562
Meet at the stern.
Repeat, meet at the stern.

981
01:21:06.634 --> 01:21:09.103
We gotta move!

982
01:21:10.839 --> 01:21:13.006
I saw them go
to the other side.

983
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:32.694
There's no one on the bridge.
Start searching the ship.

984
01:21:43.103 --> 01:21:44.672
Toll Road, you're next.

985
01:21:54.749 --> 01:21:56.483
Galan, you're up.

986
01:22:13.535 --> 01:22:14.569
What?

987
01:22:17.572 --> 01:22:18.606
Never mind.

988
01:22:19.173 --> 01:22:21.442
Let's go.

989
01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.494
Mission first!

990
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.102
I gotta turn this ship around.

991
01:22:52.874 --> 01:22:55.309
Make my sacrifice count!

992
01:22:57.277 --> 01:22:59.379
It's his decision to make.

993
01:23:05.419 --> 01:23:09.189
Decha, we need to move
or Toll Road's
not gonna make it.

994
01:23:20.367 --> 01:23:22.604
Check in block-D
then go around.

995
01:25:06.674 --> 01:25:09.577
Get the rest of
the inflatable boats up here.

996
01:25:09.711 --> 01:25:11.613
Sir,
we're headed back out to sea.

997
01:25:11.746 --> 01:25:14.281
Move it,
move it, move it, people!

998
01:25:19.754 --> 01:25:21.488
Genital fucking warts.

999
01:25:21.623 --> 01:25:22.757
Take him out!

1000
01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:25.693
Get that RIB inflated!

1001
01:25:28.495 --> 01:25:29.764
We need to get the ship
back on course.

1002
01:25:29.897 --> 01:25:31.599
Get up to the bridge
and fix this.

1003
01:25:31.733 --> 01:25:32.734
But, sir...

1004
01:25:33.668 --> 01:25:34.802
But, sir, what?

1005
01:25:34.936 --> 01:25:36.671
The nuke is gonna blow.
We can't go up--

1006
01:25:40.173 --> 01:25:42.209
How do you feel
about a promotion?

1007
01:25:42.977 --> 01:25:44.344
All to the bridge!

1008
01:25:44.478 --> 01:25:47.882
Take him down!
All to the bridge! Go, go!

1009
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:50.611
Looks like I'll be
seeing you soon, Barney.

1010
01:27:15.268 --> 01:27:16.503
Christmas!

1011
01:27:25.813 --> 01:27:27.014
Right here, Marsh.

1012
01:27:27.148 --> 01:27:30.651
Ho ho ho! I see you
called in the cavalry!

1013
01:27:31.351 --> 01:27:33.154
Well, you can't
get rid of me.

1014
01:27:33.788 --> 01:27:35.489
Well, the fun's in trying.

1015
01:27:35.623 --> 01:27:37.992
Why don't you come down
face-to-face?

1016
01:27:38.126 --> 01:27:39.961
Man-to-man.

1017
01:27:41.162 --> 01:27:42.362
Huh.

1018
01:27:42.496 --> 01:27:44.098
Old school.

1019
01:27:44.232 --> 01:27:45.566
Don't mind if I do.

1020
01:27:46.366 --> 01:27:47.802
Can't wait.

1021
01:27:47.935 --> 01:27:50.370
Don't you fucking move!
I'll be right down.

1022
01:27:52.272 --> 01:27:56.811
Barney tried
to expose me 25 years ago,
and he failed.

1023
01:27:56.944 --> 01:27:59.914
But you,
you're a good soldier.

1024
01:28:00.548 --> 01:28:01.983
You're a very good soldier.

1025
01:28:02.116 --> 01:28:05.253
But this, I mean,
this is above and beyond.

1026
01:28:05.385 --> 01:28:08.022
This--
This is next level.

1027
01:28:09.524 --> 01:28:11.659
Barney would be
proud of you.

1028
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:15.096
Well,
you can tell him yourself.

1029
01:28:15.763 --> 01:28:17.430
Because you're
about to join him.

1030
01:28:17.565 --> 01:28:19.767
So very nice.

1031
01:28:19.901 --> 01:28:21.803
Look what Santa
brought me.

1032
01:28:33.948 --> 01:28:35.348
The fuck?

1033
01:28:35.482 --> 01:28:36.584
Barney?

1034
01:28:36.717 --> 01:28:39.287
Hey, I had him
with the classics!

1035
01:28:39.419 --> 01:28:41.956
You almost fucking killed me!

1036
01:28:42.089 --> 01:28:43.658
You're welcome.

1037
01:28:46.994 --> 01:28:48.029
Come on!

1038
01:28:49.597 --> 01:28:50.998
The fuck is happening?

1039
01:28:51.132 --> 01:28:52.365
Hold on!

1040
01:28:57.872 --> 01:28:59.907
Where are the nukes?
In the stern.

1041
01:29:02.043 --> 01:29:04.245
Hey, you were dead!

1042
01:29:04.377 --> 01:29:06.747
-The hell's going on?
-I'm a little busy.

1043
01:29:36.143 --> 01:29:37.645
So what's the story?

1044
01:29:37.778 --> 01:29:39.714
Twenty-five years ago,
we were doing a covert op,

1045
01:29:39.847 --> 01:29:41.682
and eight of my team
got wiped out.

1046
01:29:41.816 --> 01:29:45.219
I had to fake my own death
to open up a classified file,

1047
01:29:45.353 --> 01:29:49.190
driving Marsh out of hiding
so I could prove he's Ocelot.

1048
01:29:49.323 --> 01:29:50.958
Why'd you keep it from us?

1049
01:29:51.092 --> 01:29:52.994
If I didn't take that job,
they'd all be alive.

1050
01:29:53.127 --> 01:29:55.529
So, it was personal.

1051
01:29:56.230 --> 01:29:58.165
You understand.

1052
01:30:30.865 --> 01:30:31.899
Whew.

1053
01:30:32.533 --> 01:30:34.101
I need a drink.

1054
01:30:34.835 --> 01:30:35.870
Me too.

1055
01:30:37.405 --> 01:30:39.040
-You're buying.
-I'm broke.

1056
01:30:39.173 --> 01:30:41.943
- You were funnier
when you were dead.

1057
01:30:44.211 --> 01:30:46.580
Great spending time
with you again.

1058
01:30:46.714 --> 01:30:48.549
But you could use a shower.

1059
01:31:03.698 --> 01:31:04.932
Toll Road,
you owe me 20 bucks.

1060
01:31:05.066 --> 01:31:06.334
Guess you won't
be needing glasses.

1061
01:31:06.466 --> 01:31:07.735
Not bad.

1062
01:31:07.868 --> 01:31:08.970
Hey.

1063
01:31:09.103 --> 01:31:13.641
Salute to my friends
who never quit.

1064
01:31:13.774 --> 01:31:15.142
Cheers to you all.

1065
01:31:15.276 --> 01:31:16.143
<i>Salud.</i>
Salute.

1066
01:31:16.277 --> 01:31:18.179
To you guys.

1067
01:31:18.312 --> 01:31:20.614
What about that corny quote
on the ship, Christmas?

1068
01:31:20.748 --> 01:31:24.852
-You don't need to
repeat that, Toll Road.
-"Make my sacrifice count!"

1069
01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:26.520
Yeah, fuck you.

1070
01:31:26.654 --> 01:31:28.322
Stop giving him
such a hard time.

1071
01:31:28.456 --> 01:31:30.124
I think it's sweet.

1072
01:31:30.257 --> 01:31:32.059
Aw.
That's sweet.

1073
01:31:32.193 --> 01:31:35.196
They're all just jealous
because you're
the most handsome one.

1074
01:31:35.329 --> 01:31:36.330
I know.

1075
01:31:36.464 --> 01:31:38.032
Ain't love beautiful?

1076
01:31:38.165 --> 01:31:40.267
Hey, Toll Road.

1077
01:31:41.302 --> 01:31:42.536
Really?

1078
01:31:43.337 --> 01:31:44.572
Ah.

1079
01:31:44.705 --> 01:31:46.741
Barney Ross,
back from the dead.

1080
01:31:46.874 --> 01:31:50.811
Only you could walk away
from a blazing inferno
with not a scratch on you.

1081
01:31:50.945 --> 01:31:53.914
You are like a mythical bird
raising up from the ashes.

1082
01:31:54.048 --> 01:31:55.916
I don't know
how you do it.
Just a moment.

1083
01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:57.918
I am relaxed. I'm trying
to talk to my hero over here.

1084
01:31:58.052 --> 01:31:59.787
Would you give me some space
please, Easy Day?

1085
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.690
Hey, lame brain,
you got a minute?

1086
01:32:02.823 --> 01:32:04.558
Of course.
A minor question.

1087
01:32:04.692 --> 01:32:05.926
Step right in.

1088
01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.229
-There it is. Piece of junk.
-Ah.

1089
01:32:08.362 --> 01:32:09.330
I missed this.

1090
01:32:09.463 --> 01:32:11.165
Thanks, my friend.
Yeah.

1091
01:32:12.133 --> 01:32:14.869
I need to know.
Who the corpse is?

1092
01:32:15.002 --> 01:32:16.203
Exactly.

1093
01:32:16.337 --> 01:32:19.240
You ever wonder
what happened
to Jumbo Shrimp?

1094
01:32:23.244 --> 01:32:26.647
<i>Warning. Terrain ahead.</i>
<i>Too low.</i>

1095
01:32:27.982 --> 01:32:32.019
<i>Warning. No landing gear.</i>
<i>Pull up.</i>

1096
01:32:38.793 --> 01:32:40.027
You didn't.

1097
01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:44.765
Oh, yes, I did.
