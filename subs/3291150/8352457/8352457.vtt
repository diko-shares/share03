00:10:57.134 --> 00:10:58.234
Okay.

182
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:16.780
[assailant] Overwatch,
what is the status?

183
00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:22.224
[overwatch operator] Sir, there are
three soldiers guarding the general.

184
00:11:22.225 --> 00:11:23.456
You‘re gonna need backup.

185
00:11:23.457 --> 00:11:25.492
I repeat, wait for backup.

186
00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:32.729
What the fuck is he doing?

187
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.732
No, no, no. No, no,
please. Please, don‘t.

188
00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:38.769

191

192
00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:14.276
[grunts, chuckles]

193
00:12:14.277 --> 00:12:16.245
Are my eyes deceiving me? Why?

194
00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:19.281
[Christmas] What‘s that
thing on Gunner‘s head?

195
00:12:19.282 --> 00:12:20.910
[Barney] It looks
like a sick cat.

196
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.615
Cats are cute.

197
00:12:23.616 --> 00:12:26.222
That looks like
tumbleweed. [chuckles]

198
00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:29.258
- Hey, good evening, big man.
- [chuckles]

199
00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.459
Let‘s talk. What‘s that
thing on your head?

200
00:12:32.427 --> 00:12:33.658
Oh, the wig?

201
00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:35.924
Yeah, the wig. Question is, why?

202
00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:38.201
Well, I was chatting with
this girl on the Internet

203
00:12:38.202 --> 00:12:40.269
and she likes that
‘70s look, you know.

204
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.435
The Farrah Fawcett thing.

205
00:12:41.436 --> 00:12:43.602
Got it. You met her yet?

206
00:12:43.603 --> 00:12:46.704
Why... Why would I do
that? I like the mystery.

207
00:12:46.705 --> 00:12:48.574
Understand? [Barney]
Yeah, that makes sense.

208
00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:50.246
Sounds special. It does.

209
00:12:50.247 --> 00:12:51.907
I liked him better
when he was a drunk.

210
00:12:51.908 --> 00:12:53.381
I know what you mean. Me too.

211
00:12:53.382 --> 00:12:54.680
I‘m happy for you.

212
00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:00.587
[Gunner] Hey, is
this the new guy?

213
00:13:01.588 --> 00:13:03.589
[Barney] Hey, it‘s Easy Day.

214
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.525
Good man. Ex-special forces.

215
00:13:05.526 --> 00:13:07.660
- Hey, Barney.
- Hey, Easy.

216
00:13:08.562 --> 00:13:10.497
This our sniper?

217
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.764
Don‘t worry about it. I
got a prescription scope.

218
00:13:13.765 --> 00:13:15.733
[Easy Day] What?

219
00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:17.537
Well, Hawkeyes,
remember this face.

220
00:13:17.538 --> 00:13:18.901
Don‘t shoot it by accident.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:21.970
You don‘t have
to worry about me.

Who‘s this guy?

224
00:13:23.313 --> 00:13:24.841
You‘re slipping, pal.

225
00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:26.843
You hired him.
That‘s Galgo‘s son.

226
00:13:26.844 --> 00:13:30.319
I have the eyesight, the heart
and the sex drive of my father.

227
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.914
Tell me he doesn‘t talk
as much as his father.

228
00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:33.487
He‘s worse. No.

229
00:13:33.488 --> 00:13:34.686
Twice as bad.

230
00:13:34.687 --> 00:13:36.326
It‘s gonna be a long trip.

231
00:13:36.953 --> 00:13:38.790
I am Galan.

232
00:13:39.824 --> 00:13:41.330
That suppose to mean something?

233
00:13:41.331 --> 00:13:43.563
[Barney laughs]

234
00:13:43.564 --> 00:13:45.565
It‘s supposed to
mean a little something.

235
00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:48.238
All right, cut the
bullshit. All eyes on me.

236
00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:49.305
Who‘s the suit?

237
00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:51.472
His name is Marsh.

238
00:13:51.473 --> 00:13:53.276
I did a few things with
him before I met you.

239
00:13:53.277 --> 00:13:55.872
He‘s CIA. Hey,
Barney, how you doing?

240
00:13:55.873 --> 00:13:57.346
How you doing, Marsh?

241
00:13:57.347 --> 00:13:58.447
How they hanging?

Gravity‘s setting in.

243
00:14:01.384 --> 00:14:03.385
Welcome to the club.

244
00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:05.453
As much as I would like to
exchange pleasantries with you guys,

245
00:14:05.454 --> 00:14:07.323
there‘s a pressing
matter at hand.

246
00:14:07.324 --> 00:14:09.787
Meet Suharato Rahmat.

247
00:14:09.788 --> 00:14:12.328
Former British national
turned arms dealer.

248
00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:13.923
He has his own private
army and he‘s been hired

249
00:14:13.924 --> 00:14:16.497
to steal some detonators
for nuclear missiles

250
00:14:16.498 --> 00:14:18.466
for a very dangerous client.

251
00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:21.304
Word on the street is the
client‘s name is Ocelot.

252
00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:22.965
[Barney] Hmm.

253
00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:25.473
Now, those detonators
get in the hands of Ocelot,

254
00:14:25.474 --> 00:14:28.278
he‘s planning on using them to
create an international incident.

255
00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:30.039
We can‘t let that happen.

256
00:14:31.348 --> 00:14:33.811
So that‘s where
you guys come in.

257
00:14:33.812 --> 00:14:37.287
Your landing zone is Qaddafi‘s
old chemical war plant in Libya,

258
00:14:37.288 --> 00:14:39.586
which I hear is very
nice this time of year.

259
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:42.985
Your mission is to make
sure the detonators stay there.

260
00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:44.558
All right?

261
00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:46.329
That‘s all I got. Good luck.

262
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.957
Barney, keep ‘em tucked.

263
00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.465
I‘ll do my best.

264
00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.667
Operation Ocelot. Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:56.735
When were you gonna tell me?

266
00:14:56.736 --> 00:14:58.896
When you stopped playing
footsies with your girlfriend.

267
00:15:04.513 --> 00:15:07.042
Hey, why‘s Christmas so
pissed about this Ocelot mission?

268
00:15:07.043 --> 00:15:10.386
[laughs] He‘s just
being Christmas.

269
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.982
- Copy that.
- [Toll Road] He knows Barney very well.

270
00:15:12.983 --> 00:15:16.590
He knows exactly how far
he‘s willing to go to end Ocelot.

271
00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:18.922
Who the hell names
himself Ocelot?

272
00:15:18.923 --> 00:15:21.529
Years ago, the CIA hired Barney

273
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.796
to find out who code
name "Ocelot" actually is.

274
00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:28.404
He was close when somebody
walked him into an ambush

275
00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:30.506
and nearly killed
his entire team.

276
00:15:30.935 --> 00:15:32.540
Damn.

277
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:34.674
Yeah, some would
say Ocelot‘s a ghost

278
00:15:34.675 --> 00:15:37.908
that Barney created to cover
his own ass for a mistake.

279
00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:39.580
No fucking way.

280
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.881
Ocelot exists and Barney
will bury him someday.

281
00:15:44.355 --> 00:15:46.422
What the fuck happened
to your ear, man?

282
00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:48.721
I‘m glad you asked me that.

283
00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:53.022
I wrestled in college. Common affliction
in that sport is contusions to the ear.

284
00:15:53.023 --> 00:15:56.059
Small pocket of blood that
separates the skin from the cartilage.

285
00:16:06.036 --> 00:16:07.939
Come on, big bird.

286
00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:16.386
Get up there, you deathtrap.

287
00:16:16.387 --> 00:16:17.817

my first ménage à trois.

291

You know. You know, Toll
Road, what I‘m talking about, right?

292
00:16:42.677 --> 00:16:43.776
Hey.

293
00:16:43.777 --> 00:16:46.142
You know what is
a golden shower?

294
00:16:48.584 --> 00:16:50.453
It‘s when the woman, she...

295
00:16:50.454 --> 00:16:53.181
She squats down on top of
you and releases her bladder.

296
00:16:53.182 --> 00:16:54.721
It‘s very liberating.

297
00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.723
Wow, a world-class pervert.

298
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.461
You know what is
a golden shower?

299
00:16:58.462 --> 00:17:00.661
You look like the type
who has had one before.

300
00:17:00.662 --> 00:17:02.663
I‘m cutting these losers.

301
00:17:02.664 --> 00:17:06.128
I heard too much of that.
It‘s tune time. Time for music.

It‘s ancient.

It‘s soothing.

305
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:12.937
Soothing? Yeah.

00:17:12.938 --> 00:17:14.906

You know I had a
panic attack last night.

Did you really?
Are you sure? Yeah.

310
00:17:20.649 --> 00:17:22.111
Like your skin starts to crawl?

Your heart is
beating? You know it.

pretend you‘re happy with your life.

00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:28.051
I am happy.

00:17:28.052 --> 00:17:31.593
By the way, you‘re
the worst doctor, ever.

315
00:17:31.594 --> 00:17:34.663
Maybe it’s Gina who‘s
making you anxious.

316
00:17:35.598 --> 00:17:37.060
She actually relaxes me.

Barney was part of

international agencies.

592
00:36:19.721 --> 00:36:23.790

parties involved decided to seal the file

until everyone associated
with it was dead.

594

So once Barney passed,
that file was declassified.

00:45:01.572 --> 00:45:03.408
And bring him or her in.

718
00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:05.740
As you know, Barney‘s
death opened up a file

719
00:45:05.741 --> 00:45:08.347
that reveals the name of a
man who worked with Ocelot.

720
00:45:08.348 --> 00:45:10.415
A witness in witness protection.

721
00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:12.154
More on him from Russo.

722
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.321
Name‘s Phen Lyong Bai.

723
00:45:15.322 --> 00:45:18.423
Ocelot‘s former partner
who‘d love to rat Ocelot out.

724
00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:20.128
Snitches get stitches.
Right, Gunner?

725
00:45:20.129 --> 00:45:22.130
That‘s right.
Snitches get stitches.

726
00:45:22.131 --> 00:45:24.726
I don‘t have to tell you
how sensitive this mission is.

727
00:45:24.727 --> 00:45:29.566
If the Russians get wind that
the US forces are not only near

728
00:45:29.567 --> 00:45:31.370
but inside Russian territory,

729
00:45:31.371 --> 00:45:33.273
it‘s a World War III shit show.

730
00:45:33.274 --> 00:45:35.539
Understood?

731
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.442
So that‘s why this mission
carries no US signature whatsoever.

732
00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:39.411
Full deniability.

733
00:45:39.412 --> 00:45:41.842
If this goes bad, it‘s on
you. And one last thing.

734
00:45:41.843 --> 00:45:45.615
Since you Neanderthals dicked up
that last mission in Libya without me,

735
00:45:45.616 --> 00:45:48.882
I‘m gonna be coming along
to babysit you this time.

736
00:45:48.883 --> 00:45:51.555
Now, won‘t that be fun? Gina.

737
00:45:51.556 --> 00:45:55.625
All right, so the mission‘s
gonna go down like this.

738
00:45:55.626 --> 00:45:59.167
We‘re gonna run this assault as a
split team with two separate objectives.

739
00:45:59.168 --> 00:46:00.564
We‘re gonna HALO in.

740
00:46:00.565 --> 00:46:02.170
Team Alpha‘s gonna
secure the bridge

741
00:46:02.171 --> 00:46:04.172
while Bravo searches
and sweeps the boat.

742
00:46:04.173 --> 00:46:06.900
We‘re gonna identify, kill-capture
both Ocelot and Rahmat,

743
00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:10.640
secure the detonators and the
nuclear components, helo extract.

744
00:46:10.641 --> 00:46:12.247
Any questions?

745
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.450
Is my delivery a little
different than Barney‘s?

746
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:20.749
He probably would
have just said, "Let‘s go."

747
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.190
Yeah.

748
00:46:22.191 --> 00:46:23.324
Well...

749
00:46:23.885 --> 00:46:25.260
let‘s go.

750
00:46:32.663 --> 00:46:34.269
Is that an axe?

751
00:46:35.336 --> 00:46:36.831
No, it‘s a snow shovel.

752
00:46:36.832 --> 00:46:41.408
That makes sense. Not for
humanity, but for you it makes sense.

753
00:46:47.612 --> 00:46:49.647
[Christmas] Hey.
So what‘s your story?

754
00:46:50.846 --> 00:46:53.914
Barney told me you
were ex-Task Force 90.

755
00:46:53.915 --> 00:46:55.982
Ultimate killer type.

756
00:46:55.983 --> 00:46:58.392
Never seen anyone
faster or better.

757
00:47:00.394 --> 00:47:04.431
There‘s only so many times
you can kill a man, Christmas.

758
00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:06.894
Each time,

759
00:47:06.895 --> 00:47:09.336
it gets easier.

760
00:47:09.337 --> 00:47:14.507
You become numb to
pain, to joy, and to love.

761
00:47:16.509 --> 00:47:18.576
With every person you kill,

762
00:47:18.577 --> 00:47:22.251
you lose a little
more of yourself.

763
00:47:23.648 --> 00:47:26.981
I had to stop before
there was nothing left.

764
00:48:47.028 --> 00:48:49.371
Figured I‘d be using
my axe by now.

765
00:48:54.673 --> 00:48:56.938
This is too quiet.
Something ain‘t right.

766
00:48:56.939 --> 00:49:00.942
Easy Day, Lash, you‘re with me. The
rest of you, swing around port quarter.

767
00:49:00.943 --> 00:49:03.384
Where‘s port quarter again?

768
00:49:03.385 --> 00:49:06.849
I was Army. We said left and
right, not port and starship shit.

769
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.456
Starboard is right.

770
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:11.656
Port, left. Quarter, back.

771
00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:13.087
[Toll Road] Got it. Let‘s move.

772
00:49:46.428 --> 00:49:48.495
[Marsh] Got a bad
feeling about this.

773
00:49:48.496 --> 00:49:50.860
Yeah, where the
hell is everybody?

774
00:49:50.861 --> 00:49:53.028
The nuke is definitely
onboard. [beeping]

775
00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.834
All right, listen up. Bad news.

776
00:49:57.835 --> 00:50:00.441
They already have
uranium with the detonators.

777
00:50:00.442 --> 00:50:03.874
There is now an active
nuclear bomb on the ship.

778
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.042
We‘re about to take the bridge.

779
00:50:18.592 --> 00:50:20.087
It‘s a ghost town in here.

780
00:50:20.088 --> 00:50:22.925
Go! Put your weapons down now!

781
00:50:22.926 --> 00:50:26.534

782

783

First Libya, now this.

784
00:50:33.167 --> 00:50:35.476
Somebody knew we
were coming. Both times.

785
00:50:35.477 --> 00:50:36.972
My intel was solid.

786
00:50:36.973 --> 00:50:38.908
- Your intel was shit.
- Ah, shit on this.

787
00:50:38.909 --> 00:50:40.646
The intel could
have been leaked.

- We don‘t know you.
- He was verified.

789

Well, then maybe it
was your new girlfriend.

790

[Toll Road] Fuck you, Gunner.

791
00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:49.523
You sold us out in
Vilena on that mission.

792

Think I‘d forget about that?

793
00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.462
Somebody did sell us out.

How about your man?

795
00:50:55.629 --> 00:50:57.828
You sold him out so
you could be on top.

Back off. She wouldn‘t do that.

may have a rat onboard.

894
00:58:54.206 --> 00:58:56.241
Check everyone‘s status.

895
00:58:57.341 --> 00:58:58.946
Takk? [sighs]

896
00:58:58.947 --> 00:59:00.641
Takk can‘t come to
the phone right now.

897
00:59:02.115 --> 00:59:03.380
He‘s a little limp.

898
00:59:06.284 --> 00:59:08.417
Who is this?
[Christmas laughing]

899
00:59:08.418 --> 00:59:11.354
A man who made a
mistake letting you live.

900
00:59:11.355 --> 00:59:14.390
But I‘m here to remedy that. Ah.

901
00:59:14.391 --> 00:59:17.228
Look who‘s still
trying to be a hero.

902
00:59:17.229 --> 00:59:19.967
How nice of you to come aboard.

903
00:59:19.968 --> 00:59:23.234
If you‘re hoping for a redo of the
mess in Libya, you‘re too late, I‘m afraid.

904
00:59:23.235 --> 00:59:25.500
My men are on their
way to hunt you down.

905
00:59:25.501 --> 00:59:29.273
So I guess it‘s up to me
to put you in an early grave.

906
00:59:29.274 --> 00:59:32.981
Just like I did
your friend in Libya.

907
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:36.710
Correction. He wasn‘t my friend.

908
00:59:37.414 --> 00:59:39.019
He was my brother.

909
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.647
So you can bring your army.

910
00:59:40.648 --> 00:59:42.715
Bring all the fucking
men you want

911
00:59:42.716 --> 00:59:44.453
and I‘ll work through
every last one of them.

912
00:59:44.454 --> 00:59:46.554
When I get to you,

913
00:59:46.555 --> 00:59:48.523
I‘ll make sure that the
only way you leave this ship

914
00:59:48.524 --> 00:59:51.296
is in a wonderful
variety of pieces.

923
01:01:46.312 --> 01:01:47.708
[Pavel] Yes, sir. Location?

924
01:01:47.709 --> 01:01:49.315

925
01:01:55.387 --> 01:01:56.817

What are you doing?

937
01:05:03.839 --> 01:05:06.038
Thought you were
done with this life.

938
01:05:06.039 --> 01:05:09.746
It would be disrespectful to
Barney‘s memory to let his friend die.

939
01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:12.517
I like the look.

940
01:05:12.518 --> 01:05:13.881
Thank you.

941
01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:16.390
- Then let‘s get to it.
- Okay.

942
01:05:17.787 --> 01:05:19.690
[shouting continues]

943
01:05:41.008 --> 01:05:42.976
Everything‘s sealed
tight down here.

944
01:05:42.977 --> 01:05:44.780
[Toll Road] Yeah, these
are welded up solid too.

945
01:05:44.781 --> 01:05:45.913
Okay, so what‘s next?

946
01:05:45.914 --> 01:05:47.717
Bilge system.

947
01:05:47.718 --> 01:05:49.917
What? Bilge system.

948
01:05:49.918 --> 01:05:53.558
In emergencies, it clears
water from the ship‘s dry areas.

949
01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:55.626
If you get it open, it
should let us out of here.

950
01:05:55.627 --> 01:05:57.958
[Gunner] Come on, man.
Let‘s get this fucking thing open.

951
01:05:57.959 --> 01:05:59.961
[groaning] Damn it.

952
01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:05.471
- Well, that ain‘t budging.
- No shit. It‘s got to get wet.

953
01:06:05.472 --> 01:06:06.901
What?

954
01:06:06.902 --> 01:06:08.706
Wet. If it gets wet, it‘ll open.

955
01:06:09.971 --> 01:06:13.072
Well, anybody gotta
pee? [Toll Road] I gotta go.

956
01:06:13.073 --> 01:06:16.076
I‘ve had to piss since
we HALO‘d in here.

957
01:06:24.986 --> 01:06:26.790
A little privacy, please?

958
01:06:36.602 --> 01:06:38.065
The hyoid bone.

959
01:06:39.902 --> 01:06:43.476
It‘s the only bone in the human
body not connected to any others.

960
01:06:43.477 --> 01:06:47.844
It‘s right here in the throat.
Without it, we cannot speak.

961
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:51.484
With these hands, I
will claw the hyoid bone

962
01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:53.486
from the throat of
that fucker Rahmat,

963
01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:55.048
stick it up culo,

964
01:06:55.049 --> 01:06:56.951
then make both of
their asses apologize

965
01:06:56.952 --> 01:06:59.151
while they drown
in their own blood.

966
01:06:59.152 --> 01:07:01.593
Barney was my hero.

967
01:07:01.594 --> 01:07:03.760
I do not speak, I cannot speak,

968
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:08.028
because my mind is full of
these brutal, visceral fantasies,

969
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:11.868
fantasies that will now
become a hellish reality.

970
01:07:12.572 --> 01:07:13.672
[exhales]

971
01:07:15.003 --> 01:07:17.104
You should go
back to not talking.

972
01:07:19.073 --> 01:07:21.141
[urinating continues]

01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:26.684
[zipper zips up]

974
01:07:26.685 --> 01:07:28.884
- Done.
- Any takers?

975
01:07:28.885 --> 01:07:31.822
This will lead us to the
men who killed Barney?

976
01:07:32.493 --> 01:07:34.186
[Gina] Uh, yes.

977
01:07:34.187 --> 01:07:35.661
I will avenge him.

978
01:07:42.228 --> 01:07:44.867
Guess he does
like golden showers.

979
01:07:44.868 --> 01:07:48.607
Lyong Bai is en route
to you as we speak.

980
01:07:48.608 --> 01:07:52.743
I expect to have my
team returned alive.

981
01:07:52.744 --> 01:07:55.548
Of course. For what is
a man without his word?

982
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:57.914
- [scoffs] - Prepare
for exchange.

983
01:07:58.244 --> 01:07:59.553
Moving out!

984
01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:03.215
- This way.
- Okay.

985
01:08:03.216 --> 01:08:05.756
Your friends will be really
happy to see you, right?

986
01:08:05.757 --> 01:08:07.219
Probably not.

987
01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.529
Gina will have to
admit she needs me.

988
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:10.662
On three. Yeah.

989
01:08:10.663 --> 01:08:11.763
Three.

990
01:08:14.161 --> 01:08:15.502
Nobody here.

991
01:08:15.503 --> 01:08:16.932
No shit.

992
01:08:16.933 --> 01:08:18.033

993

[sniffing] Yeah.

995
01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:28.846
We‘re gonna stay quiet
until it‘s time to get loud.

996
01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:30.848
Okay, okay. Yeah.

997
01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:36.656
Get on the ground!

998
01:08:37.888 --> 01:08:39.186
Time to get loud?

999
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.192
It‘s you who needs to get
down on the ground, pal.

1000
01:08:45.863 --> 01:08:47.128
Or what?

1001
01:08:51.297 --> 01:08:53.607
Or get wasted by an Expendable.

1002
01:08:55.037 --> 01:08:57.775
Don‘t tell me. You‘re
happy to see me.

1003
01:08:57.776 --> 01:09:00.910
Technically, you‘re not an
Expendable anymore, Christmas.

1004
01:09:00.911 --> 01:09:02.307
Especially you.

1005
01:09:02.308 --> 01:09:04.749
Such a pleasure. Likewise.

1006
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.212
Great timing. Easy Day.

1007
01:09:06.213 --> 01:09:07.720
Feliz Navidad.

was gonna believe

1012
01:09:17.994 --> 01:09:20.325
you were actually just
gifting me your knife?

1013

You gifted her your knife?

1014
01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:24.263
And they say romance is dead.

1015
01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:27.574
He put a tracker in it. It
was all part of the plan.

1016
01:09:27.575 --> 01:09:29.775

Hey, Gunner, watch our six.

I like your hair.

1022
01:09:45.087 --> 01:09:47.055
- Who‘s your new friend?
- Decha.

1023
01:09:47.056 --> 01:09:49.959
Old friend of Barney‘s. Kicks
ass with the best of them.

1024

Any friend of Barney‘s
is all right by me.

1025

Rahmat took Marsh.
Huh. I‘m devastated.

1026
01:09:55.163 --> 01:09:59.332
First things first. Toll Road, I need
you to take a look at something.

1027
01:10:01.741 --> 01:10:04.105
It‘s a big fucking bomb.

1028
01:10:04.106 --> 01:10:06.108
With the detonators
that we didn‘t get.

1029
01:10:06.878 --> 01:10:08.175
We‘re fucked.

1030
01:10:08.176 --> 01:10:09.946
Can you elaborate?

1031
01:10:09.947 --> 01:10:11.981
This thing‘s wired
to go in 27 minutes.

1032
01:10:11.982 --> 01:10:14.753
It‘s tamperproof.
Got mercury switches.

1033
01:10:14.754 --> 01:10:17.855
The only way we‘re shutting this bad
boy down is to find the remote kill switch.

1034
01:10:17.856 --> 01:10:19.087
That‘s the last line of defense.

1035
01:10:19.088 --> 01:10:21.056
Now, it‘s short range,

1036
01:10:21.057 --> 01:10:23.289
so whoever has that on their
person is on this fucking boat.

1037
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:24.665
Rahmat. [Gina] Rahmat.

1038
01:10:25.798 --> 01:10:27.062
Who‘s Rahmat?

1039
01:10:27.063 --> 01:10:28.767
Guy who killed Barney.

1040
01:10:28.768 --> 01:10:31.330

kill switch now.

Switch off Rahmat permanently.

01:12:48.105 --> 01:12:49.304
Fuck it!

1069
01:12:57.543 --> 01:12:58.951
You‘re welcome. Huh.

1070
01:13:02.053 --> 01:13:03.120
Don‘t mention it.

1071
01:13:04.319 --> 01:13:06.827
[shouting continues]
[gunfire continues]

1072
01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:09.258
[yells]

1073
01:13:13.262 --> 01:13:14.362
Good to be back.

1074
01:13:18.531 --> 01:13:19.807
I got you.

1075
01:13:21.039 --> 01:13:22.106
Thanks.

1076
01:13:41.862 --> 01:13:42.995
Puta.

1077
01:13:44.997 --> 01:13:46.493
[screams]

1078
01:13:52.466 --> 01:13:54.600
[groans]

1079
01:14:00.111 --> 01:14:01.211
I got him.

1080
01:14:13.487 --> 01:14:15.126
- [yells]
- [buzzing]

1081
01:14:18.866 --> 01:14:20.163
Toll Road!

1082
01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:23.002
Easy! Man down!
Man down! [groaning]

1083
01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.599
[mercs continue shouting]

1084
01:14:29.041 --> 01:14:30.569
Can you kiss that
and make it better?

1085
01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:33.210
Maybe later. I‘m a
little busy right now.

1086
01:14:33.573 --> 01:14:35.080
I got him.

1087
01:14:41.284 --> 01:14:43.649
Hey! [grunting]

1088
01:14:56.596 --> 01:14:58.939
- [yells]
- [grunting continues]

1089
01:15:11.611 --> 01:15:13.018
[screams]

1090
01:15:13.019 --> 01:15:14.086
[thuds]

1091
01:15:18.618 --> 01:15:20.619
[pilot] Ready for
prisoner exchange.

1092
01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.555
Three minutes
until we touch down.

1093
01:15:22.556 --> 01:15:24.392
Standing by for the exchange.

1094
01:15:24.393 --> 01:15:26.131
Proceed as planned.

1095
01:15:26.461 --> 01:15:28.430
[groans]

1096
01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.582
How you doing, Rahmat?

1097
01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:54.290
I see you like to play with knives.
Well, I ain‘t playing no more.

1098
01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:57.293
You‘re gonna give me the kill
switch, and we‘re gonna end all this.

1099
01:15:57.294 --> 01:15:59.065
Come and get it, hero.

1100
01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.313
[coughs]

1101
01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:52.052
[groaning]

1102
01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:13.567
Is that the biggest
one you‘ve got?

1103
01:17:13.568 --> 01:17:14.668
[groans]

1104
01:17:40.826 --> 01:17:42.134
Nah.

1105
01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:44.235
That’s the biggest one I got.

1106
01:17:44.236 --> 01:17:47.767
[wheezing, groaning]

1107
01:17:51.111 --> 01:17:52.375
Lee, you good?

1108
01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.476
Yeah.

1109
01:17:54.147 --> 01:17:56.776
[groans, screaming]

1110
01:17:59.086 --> 01:18:00.779
Where‘s the kill switch?

1111
01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.124
You fucking idiot. I
don‘t have the kill switch.

1112
01:18:05.422 --> 01:18:07.192
My boss has it.

1113
01:18:07.193 --> 01:18:08.721
[groans]

1114
01:18:08.722 --> 01:18:11.131
[helicopter whirring] Ocelot.

1115
01:18:28.775 --> 01:18:30.611
Phen Lyong Bai is here.

1116
01:18:30.612 --> 01:18:33.285
He‘s our witness that
can identify Ocelot.

1117
01:18:42.525 --> 01:18:44.229
- Hello, Bai.
- Oh, my God, no.

1118
01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:45.693
No! Bye-bye, Bai.

1119
01:18:53.701 --> 01:18:55.306
Marsh is Ocelot.

1120
01:18:55.307 --> 01:18:56.747
He‘s had the kill
switch this whole...

1121
01:18:57.705 --> 01:18:59.277
[groans]

1122
01:18:59.278 --> 01:19:01.313
That‘s for Barney.

1123
01:19:09.387 --> 01:19:10.817
How long until detonation?

1124
01:19:11.554 --> 01:19:12.653
Twelve minutes.

1125
01:19:12.654 --> 01:19:14.490
All right, we got 12 minutes

1126
01:19:14.491 --> 01:19:16.460
before this ship blows
up like a Roman candl...

1127
01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:30.506
Hey, Marsh. I guess you
won‘t be needing that anymore.

1128
01:19:30.507 --> 01:19:32.442
All right, Christmas!

1129
01:19:32.443 --> 01:19:34.576
You‘re like genital warts!

1130
01:19:34.577 --> 01:19:38.448
Always showing up where you‘re
not wanted and refusing to go away!

1131
01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:40.550
You got something I need, Marsh.

1132
01:19:41.617 --> 01:19:43.519
I‘m coming down to get it.

1133
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.786
I guess you figured out
that this device right here

1134
01:19:46.787 --> 01:19:49.426
is the only thing
preventing World War III,

1135
01:19:49.427 --> 01:19:52.331
a conflict that, while
devastating for many,

1136
01:19:52.925 --> 01:19:54.299
it‘ll be insanely,

1137
01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.696
insanely,

1138
01:19:55.697 --> 01:19:58.369
insanely profitable
for somebody.

1139
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:00.635
And that somebody
is gonna be me.

1140
01:20:00.636 --> 01:20:03.968
And the Expendables
will take all the blame!

1141
01:20:03.969 --> 01:20:05.905
So, enjoy the show!

1142
01:20:09.447 --> 01:20:11.217
Kill them all!

1143
01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:12.252
Take cover!

1144
01:20:15.255 --> 01:20:16.421
[Lash] Everybody get down!

1145
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:18.918
[groaning]

1146
01:20:18.919 --> 01:20:22.756
We need to get clear of this
boat or we‘re all gonna get fried!

1147
01:20:22.757 --> 01:20:25.462
Jumping overboard is seeming
like a decent plan right now.

1148
01:20:25.463 --> 01:20:28.466
We‘ll never make it out of the blast
zone. We‘ll never make it in time.

1149
01:20:32.272 --> 01:20:34.934
- [groans] - Hey, man, you‘re
not going down on my watch.

1150
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.608
We gotta move.
He‘s bleeding out.

1151
01:20:39.609 --> 01:20:41.005
I got an idea.

1152
01:20:41.006 --> 01:20:44.283
We can take my
boat. It‘s being towed.

1153
01:20:44.284 --> 01:20:45.713
That‘s a great idea.

1154
01:20:45.714 --> 01:20:47.253
Next time, let‘s
start with that!

1155
01:20:47.254 --> 01:20:48.980
Yeah!

1156
01:20:48.981 --> 01:20:50.586
Gunner, give us cover
fire. We‘re on the way out.

1157
01:20:50.587 --> 01:20:52.655
Copy that. Cover
fire. [mercs shouting]

1158
01:20:58.265 --> 01:21:00.960
[Gina] Meet at the stern.
Repeat, meet at the stern.

1159
01:21:03.864 --> 01:21:05.370
[shouts in Bulgarian]

1160
01:21:05.371 --> 01:21:07.372
[groaning]

1161
01:21:07.373 --> 01:21:09.507
- We gotta move!
- [Toll Road grunts]

1162
01:21:11.377 --> 01:21:13.412
[merc] I saw them
go to the other side.

1163
01:21:30.528 --> 01:21:33.365
There‘s no one on the
bridge. Start searching the ship.

1164
01:21:33.366 --> 01:21:35.027
[mercs shouting]

1165
01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.070
Toll Road, you‘re next.

1166
01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.884
Galan, you‘re up.

1167
01:22:13.868 --> 01:22:14.968
What?

1168
01:22:17.905 --> 01:22:19.005
Never mind.

1169
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:21.843
[scoffs] Let‘s go.

1170
01:22:39.795 --> 01:22:40.895
Mission first!

1171
01:22:47.539 --> 01:22:49.508
I gotta turn this ship around.

1172
01:22:53.413 --> 01:22:55.712
Make my sacrifice count!

1173
01:22:57.813 --> 01:22:59.782
It‘s his decision to make.

1174
01:23:05.953 --> 01:23:09.594
Decha, we need to move or
Toll Road‘s not gonna make it.

1175
01:23:20.902 --> 01:23:23.003
[merc] Check in
block-D then go around.

1176
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:26.512
[clamoring]

1177
01:24:24.603 --> 01:24:26.539
[shouting]

1178
01:25:07.206 --> 01:25:10.241
[merc captain] Get the rest
of the inflatable boats up here.

1179
01:25:10.242 --> 01:25:12.276
[merc] Sir, we‘re
headed back out to sea.

1180
01:25:12.277 --> 01:25:14.686
[merc captain] Move it,
move it, move it, people!

1181
01:25:20.087 --> 01:25:21.956
Genital fucking warts.

1182
01:25:21.957 --> 01:25:23.156
Take him out!

1183
01:25:24.025 --> 01:25:26.093
Get that RIB inflated!

1184
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:30.635
We need to get the
ship back on course.

1185
01:25:30.636 --> 01:25:32.065
Get up to the
bridge and fix this.

1186
01:25:32.066 --> 01:25:33.133
But, sir...

1187
01:25:34.002 --> 01:25:35.673
But, sir, what?

1188
01:25:35.674 --> 01:25:37.234
The nuke is gonna
blow. We can‘t go up...

1189
01:25:40.712 --> 01:25:42.615
How do you feel
about a promotion?

1190
01:25:43.308 --> 01:25:45.012
All to the bridge!

1191
01:25:45.013 --> 01:25:48.280
Take him down! All
to the bridge! Go, go!

1192
01:26:48.241 --> 01:26:51.078
Looks like I‘ll be seeing
you soon, Barney.

1193
01:26:51.079 --> 01:26:52.278
[sighs]

1194
01:26:52.883 --> 01:26:54.984
[screaming]

1195
01:27:15.807 --> 01:27:16.907
[Marsh] Christmas!

1196
01:27:26.147 --> 01:27:27.884
Right here, Marsh.

1197
01:27:27.885 --> 01:27:31.052
Ho ho ho! I see you
called in the cavalry!

1198
01:27:31.053 --> 01:27:33.758
Well, you can‘t get rid of me.

1199
01:27:33.759 --> 01:27:36.156
Well, the fun‘s in trying.

1200
01:27:36.157 --> 01:27:38.664
Why don‘t you come
down face-to-face?

1201
01:27:38.665 --> 01:27:40.359
Man-to-man.

1202
01:27:41.701 --> 01:27:43.031
Huh.

1203
01:27:43.032 --> 01:27:44.769
Old school.

1204
01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:45.969
Don‘t mind if I do.

1205
01:27:46.904 --> 01:27:48.674
Can‘t wait.

1206
01:27:48.675 --> 01:27:50.776
Don‘t you fucking
move! I‘ll be right down.

1207
01:27:53.009 --> 01:27:57.683
Barney tried to expose me
25 years ago, and he failed.

1208
01:27:57.684 --> 01:28:00.312
But you, you‘re a good soldier.

1209
01:28:00.313 --> 01:28:02.853
You‘re a very good soldier.

1210
01:28:02.854 --> 01:28:05.922
But this, I mean, this
is above and beyond.

1211
01:28:05.923 --> 01:28:08.420
This... This is next level.

1212
01:28:10.059 --> 01:28:12.061
Barney would be proud of you.

1213
01:28:13.392 --> 01:28:15.701
Well, you can tell him yourself.

1214
01:28:15.702 --> 01:28:18.099
Because you‘re
about to join him.

1215
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:20.431
So very nice.

1216
01:28:20.432 --> 01:28:22.203
Look what Santa brought me.

1217
01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:36.018
The fuck?

1218
01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:37.250
Barney?

1219
01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:39.956
Hey, I had him
with the classics!

1220
01:28:39.957 --> 01:28:42.420
You almost fucking killed me!

1221
01:28:42.421 --> 01:28:44.060
You‘re welcome.

1222
01:28:47.327 --> 01:28:48.427
Come on!

1223
01:28:50.132 --> 01:28:51.462
The fuck is happening?

1224
01:28:51.463 --> 01:28:52.772
Hold on!

1225
01:28:58.404 --> 01:29:00.307
Where are the
nukes? In the stern.

1226
01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:05.113
Hey, you were dead!

1227
01:29:05.114 --> 01:29:07.149
- The hell‘s going on?
- I‘m a little busy.

1228
01:29:36.475 --> 01:29:38.311
So what‘s the story?

1229
01:29:38.312 --> 01:29:40.379
Twenty-five years ago,
we were doing a covert op,

1230
01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.348
and eight of my
team got wiped out.

1231
01:29:42.349 --> 01:29:46.088
I had to fake my own death
to open up a classified file,

1232
01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:49.861
driving Marsh out of hiding
so I could prove he‘s Ocelot.

1233
01:29:49.862 --> 01:29:51.830
Why‘d you keep it from us?

1234
01:29:51.831 --> 01:29:53.458
If I didn‘t take that
job, they‘d all be alive.

1235
01:29:53.459 --> 01:29:55.934
So, it was personal.

1236
01:29:56.561 --> 01:29:58.563
You understand.

1237
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.300
Whew.

1238
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:34.500
I need a drink.

1239
01:30:35.171 --> 01:30:36.271
Me too.

1240
01:30:37.943 --> 01:30:39.911
- You‘re buying.
- I‘m broke.

1241
01:30:39.912 --> 01:30:42.343
- You were funnier when you were dead.
- [laughs]

1242
01:30:43.311 --> 01:30:44.949
[sighs]

1243
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:47.248
Great spending
time with you again.

1244
01:30:47.249 --> 01:30:48.954
But you could use a shower.

1245
01:31:01.527 --> 01:31:04.232
[cheering]

1246
01:31:04.233 --> 01:31:05.596
[Galan] Toll Road,
you owe me 20 bucks.

1247
01:31:05.597 --> 01:31:07.004
Guess you won‘t
be needing glasses.

1248
01:31:07.005 --> 01:31:08.203
Not bad.

1249
01:31:08.204 --> 01:31:09.633
Hey.

1250
01:31:09.634 --> 01:31:14.308
Salute to my friends
who never quit.

1251
01:31:14.309 --> 01:31:15.606
Cheers to you all.

1252
01:31:15.607 --> 01:31:16.607
Salud. Salute.

1253
01:31:16.608 --> 01:31:19.049
[Barney] To you guys.

1254
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:21.480
[Toll Road] What about that
corny quote on the ship, Christmas?

1255
01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:25.254
- You don‘t need to repeat that, Toll Road.
- "Make my sacrifice count!"

1256
01:31:25.925 --> 01:31:27.189
Yeah, fuck you.

1257
01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:28.993
Stop giving him
such a hard time.

1258
01:31:28.994 --> 01:31:30.588
I think it‘s sweet.

1259
01:31:30.589 --> 01:31:32.931
Aw. That‘s sweet.

1260
01:31:32.932 --> 01:31:35.659
They‘re all just jealous because
you‘re the most handsome one.

1261
01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:37.001
I know.

1262
01:31:37.002 --> 01:31:38.497
Ain‘t love beautiful?

1263
01:31:38.498 --> 01:31:40.665
Hey, Toll Road.

1264
01:31:41.633 --> 01:31:42.942
Really?

1265
01:31:43.668 --> 01:31:45.240
Ah.

1266
01:31:45.241 --> 01:31:47.605
[Galan] Barney Ross,
back from the dead.

1267
01:31:47.606 --> 01:31:51.477
Only you could walk away from a
blazing inferno with not a scratch on you.

1268
01:31:51.478 --> 01:31:54.579
You are like a mythical bird
raising up from the ashes.

1269
01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.581
I don‘t know how you
do it. Just a moment.

1270
01:31:56.582 --> 01:31:58.583
I am relaxed. I‘m trying to
talk to my hero over here.

1271
01:31:58.584 --> 01:32:00.453
Would you give me some
space please, Easy Day?

1272
01:32:00.454 --> 01:32:03.357
Hey, lame brain,
you got a minute?

1273
01:32:03.358 --> 01:32:05.227
Of course. A minor question.

1274
01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:06.591
Step right in.

1275
01:32:06.592 --> 01:32:08.692
- There it is. Piece of junk.
- Ah.

1276
01:32:08.693 --> 01:32:10.001
I missed this.

1277
01:32:10.002 --> 01:32:11.564
Thanks, my friend. Yeah.

1278
01:32:12.664 --> 01:32:15.336
I need to know.
Who the corpse is?

1279
01:32:15.337 --> 01:32:17.074
Exactly.

1280
01:32:17.075 --> 01:32:19.638
You ever wonder what
happened to Jumbo Shrimp?
