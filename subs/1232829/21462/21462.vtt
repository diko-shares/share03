Okay, all right, let's go.

21
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,507
How are you?

00:03:57,477 --> 00:04:00,386
- Remember what that one is?
- No.

23
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,875
Dre, you're killing me.

24
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:08,619
Mom, look, in China everything is old.
There's old houses, old parks...

25
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,123
old people...Look, this guy is at least
four-hundred years old.

26
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,618
Dre, please focus.
Okay?

27
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:22,592
What's your name?

28
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,423
You need to practice.
Yeah, you need to try.

29
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:25,342
No, mom.

30
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,862
- Yes, Dre. Dre...
- Mom?

31
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:31,550
- Ask him. Go ahead.
- No, mom.

32
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:35,224
Ask him "what's your name"
and "how are you". Do it, now.

33
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:51,168
Dude, I'm from Detroit.

34
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,144
What's up?

35
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,863
It's said to meet her
at number five.

36
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,671
Mrs. Packer?

37
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:20,589
- Hi. It's Parker.
- Oh, apologies, Mrs. Parker. Welcome to Beijing.

38
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:46,305
Look! There is Omatek village.
Isn't it beautiful?

39
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,327
Yes. I guess there's nothing
old in China, huh Dre?

40
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:13,666
Look at that, Dre. Beverly Hills.

41
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:16,186
We've always talked about
living there, huh?

42
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,662
I think we have talked
about the other one, mom.

43
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,793
I got a good feeling about this.

44
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,292
Oh, yeah. You must be the new
dude in 305. I'm Harry.

45
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:32,950
- Hey, what's up? I'm Dre.
- Here. Let me help you.

46
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,288
Thanks, man.

47
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,871
- Welcome to the building, Dre.
- Thanks.

48
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:45,594
Can you please explain this electricity card,
because we-we don't have these in America.

49
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:53,206
- Know any Chinese?
- Nah.

50
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:56,758
This is China.
Might not be a bad idea.

51
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:01,603
Oh, that's our park.
You should come.

52
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:05,103
Look at you.
Making friends already.

53
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,771
- Hi, I'm Dre's mother.
- Nice to meet you.

54
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,873
Nice to meet you too.
You can call me Miss Sherry.

55
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:11,877
- I'm Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

56
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:15,089
- So, I guess, I'll see you later, then?
- Maybe.

57
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,358
Okay, cool. See you.

58
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:28,867
Ok, this is your rental agreement in English.

59
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:33,330
So the landlady is Mrs. Wong.
Her English is not good.

60
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:36,455
But if something goes wrong,
you go to Mr. Han.

61
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:37,855
- His English is very good.
- Okay.

62
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:42,259
Okay. So, welcome to Beijing, Mrs. Parker.
Um, so I see you tomorrow, okay?

63
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,771
Okay, sure! Thank you.
Oh, wait, wait!

64
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,611
<i>Um, you mentioned something
about going...</i>

65
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:03,892
Oh, this is perfect, Dre. Everything we
need is in walking distance.

66
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:05,819
Oh, you know what,
we can have lunch together

67
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,719
every day at your school,
if you wanted to.

68
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,970
Negative! Not a chance.

69
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:17,341
Dre, we are not doing this in Beijing.

70
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,276
Dre, pick up your jacket!

71
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:24,663
Mom, I'm tired, okay?
I have airplane lag.

72
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,807
Airplane...

73
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,758
It's jet lag.

74
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,257
I know baby, I got it too.

75
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:46,795
But, we can't go to sleep. Cause then we'll
be up at 2 A.M. You have school tomorrow.

76
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,625
<i>Dre, can you please go
find the maintenance man?!</i>

77
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:03,186
<i>I need to take a shower,
and the hot water is broken!</i>

78
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:03,886
Yes.

79
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,013
Excuse me.

80
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,856
Um, the maintenance man?
Mr. Han?

81
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,226
Thanks.

82
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:31,387
Mr. Han?

83
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:36,975
Me and my mom, we just moved in. 305.
The hot water is not working.

84
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:42,149
Mr. Han?

85
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:50,858
Okay. Alright I just come back another time.

86
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:54,981
Or you can just show me how to do it so,
I can get out of your hair.

87
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:18,000
Um, I can always come back
if this is bad time.

88
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,523
- Hey man, you made it. Welcome.
- Thanks.

89
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,137
- You play, right? C'mon.
- Yeah.

00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:24,328
Pass!

92
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:33,013
What's up?
What's up?

93
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,979
My shooting hand.
Got some jet lag so...

94
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,828
You know, I'm just...

95
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:55,903
You want this?

96
00:12:55,904 --> 00:13:00,139
You want me to play? You know
I have no problem beatin' old people.

97
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:06,610
Back where I come from they call me
"Ping Pong Dre", alright?

98
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,610
I'm going to take it easy on you.

99
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:39,680
Come on, man.
I'm twelve.

100
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:50,746
He is really good.
I've never seen him lose to anybody.

101
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,595
Yeah.

102
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,275
- Dude. You're gonna talk to her or what?
- To who?

103
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:03,330
- To her. The girl you've been staring at.
- I wasn't staring at her, dude.

104
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,636
Yeah, you were.

105
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:11,568
- You should go talk to her, unless you're scared?
- I'm not scared of anything.

106
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:14,094
Then do it. Go.
Come on.

107
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,044
Right now.

108
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:27,483
Hey, what's up?

109
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:33,737
I forgot.
No English, um...

110
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:44,194
What language was that?

111
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:47,056
You speak English?
Me too.

112
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,176
- So, what are you listening to?
- Bach.

113
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:57,437
Bach, I listen to them all the time.
They are tight. Have you ever heard of this?

114
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,429
Oh yeah, you like it huh, right?!

115
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:22,790
Great move, one over here.

116
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,476
- Wait, wait it's coming back.
- May I touch your hair?

117
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,104
You want to touch my hair?

118
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,277
Um...Sure.

119
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:50,060
You shoud be practicing.

120
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,691
I'm practicing.

121
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:54,057
- What you're doing, you won't be needing these.
- What's your problem?

122
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,779
Leave it.

123
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:04,294
Come on, dude.

124
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:09,768
I said, leave it.

125
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,424
You want to fight?

126
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:53,928
- Are you okay?
- Leave me alone.

127
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,507
I'm fine.

128
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:01,982
- Dre, dude...
- Leave me alone.

129
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:42,992
Dre, are you ready?
Cause we got to be there in like 20 minutes.

130
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,117
I know, mom.

131
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:47,588
- And you have your uniform on, right?
- Yes, mom.

132
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,119
Don't break any rules
on the first day.

133
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:54,947
Okay, come on, I'm waiting for you.

134
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:05,715
Wait, you don't have to comin', I mean...
I can handle it.

135
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,884
Dre, don't be silly, it's your first day.

136
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,966
Plus, we both have to meet the
assist principal Mrs. Pong.

137
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:14,166
I can find her.
You need to get to work, right?!

138
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,550
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, mom.

139
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,288
Mrs. Pong.
Hi, Mrs. Pong.

140
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,469
- Mrs. Parker,  we've been waiting.
- I'm so sorry we are late...

141
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,266
We just flew from Detroit last night...

142
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:28,949
- And this is my son Dre.
- Hello.

143
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:33,921
- We only wear uniforms on Uniform day.
- Oh, that's my fault.

144
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:38,643
I didn't have a chance to read the school packages
sent to me. Will be better tomorrow.

145
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:45,114
- And hats are not permitted.
- Yeah, I should've read up on the dress code.

146
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:49,885
- Dre, is that make-up? What is that?
- Mom, I ran into a pole.

147
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:54,685
- No, you have a black eye. You've got into a fight?
- Fighting is not tolerated here.

148
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:58,045
You heard him, he ran into a pole.
Come here, Dre.

149
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,898
- Mom, don't start.
- Who did it?

150
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,926
Nobody mom, I ran into a pole. I ain't tell
you cause I know you would react like this.

151
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:05,804
Dre, you know I don't play,
if somebody hit my baby, I would tear...

152
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:08,696
I know mom,
that's why I don't tell you stuff.

153
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:11,740
- Just relax, I just ran into a...
- Yeah, yeah,  you ran into a pole.

154
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:21,291
Alright Dre, alright, alright. Look, go to class,

157
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,629
I said I love you.

158
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,139

00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:05,952
You know,

161
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,557
Oh yeah, I still got that one.

162
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,077
Thanks.

163
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:19,873

164
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:29,564

00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:32,607
So that's his name?!

166
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,832
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

167
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:40,345
- Our parents are very close.
- He definitely likes you.

168
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,751
- I have to go practice.
- Wait...

169
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:48,708
- You eat and practice at the same time?
- Yes.

170
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:53,554
But, my mom says if you eat standing up,
it gives you gas.

171
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:56,511
You're funny.

172
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,655
- Come to fix the hot water.
- It's in there.

173
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:04,348
Kid?
Kid?!

174
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:23,791
Did you just hit me in my neck
with a toothpaste cap?!

175
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:27,027
Hot water fine.
Flip switch.

176
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:31,339
Wait half hour, take shower,
flip switch off.

177
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,807
Why don't you just leave it on?

178
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:37,401
- You leave on in America?
- We don't have a switch in America.

179
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:40,350
Get switch,
Save planet.

180
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:45,644
- What happened to your eye?
- I ran into a pole.

181
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:49,210
Interesting pole.

182
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:52,907
- Dre?! I'm back.
- That's my mom.

183
00:22:52,908 --> 00:22:54,699
End it, do the handle, it's messed up.

184
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:57,012
<i>- Are you ready for school?
- Yeah.</i>

185
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:03,121
- Hey, let me help you.
- They have your favorite cereal here, I found it.

186
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:16,555
Dre, for the one hundredth time,
can you please pick up your jacket?

187
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:20,269
- One second, mom.
- No! Not in one second, now!

188
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,051
This programme is about to be over.
Give me two minutes.

189
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:25,023
Dre, I don't care!
Come and pick it up now.

190
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:28,564
- God, how many times do I have to ask you?
- Once.

191
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:31,236
- That's right. Make it happen.
- "What's with you and the jacket?!"

192
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:32,865
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Nothing.

193
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,957
Okay, just what I thought...
Nothing.

194
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,522
Thank you.

195
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:58,060
From the top again.

196
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:28,471
Okay. It's enough please. You are rushing it.
You must play the pauses.

197
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:33,845
Do you know how important this is for your family?
What it will mean for your life?

198
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:37,191
We have to work this weekend.
I'm calling you father.

199
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:44,355
We continue.

200
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:57,275
- How that sound?
- Almost like a Chinese.

201
00:25:57,276 --> 00:26:02,134
Yeah, I'm fluent. And I don't know about that guy
was talking about? I thought you sounded great.

202
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:04,355
Thank you.

203
00:26:11,463 --> 00:26:19,340
- So, you are practicing for anything? Like a show?
- Yes, I have an audition next month...

204
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:25,871
- For the Beijing Academy of Music.
- Beijing Academy of Music. Sounds important.

205
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:31,990
You know, their initials spell BAM.

206
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,414
What?

207
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:41,709
I gotta go.

208
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:05,287
Can I touch your hair?

209
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:13,498
You're gonna do something?

210
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:17,969
Just stay away from us.

211
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,602
All of us.

212
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,582
Baby?!

213
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:47,097
Dre, are you sleeping?

214
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:20,111
- Um, can you sign this?
- For the Forbidden City?!

215
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:24,571
I think it's funny that you have to give
my permission to go to the Forbidden City.

216
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,512
- Pole in Beijing.
- Not funny, mom.

217
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:30,636
Oh, cut it out, grumpy.

218
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:33,376
I'm serious, Dre. This ice cream,
I don't know what they do it,

219
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:36,349
but it's more flavoristic. What?

220
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,455
Mom, this is you. "Oh my Godness, this ice cream
here is so good, and everything in China...

221
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:44,328
is so much better than everything else..."
Aw, mom c'mon...

222
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:48,092
First of all, I don't sound like that,
and I don't move all like that.

223
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,947
You should get some ice cream, sweetie.

224
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:55,196
- Mom, mom,  c'mon.
- Dre! Wait!

225
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:58,887
Boy, you won't get running from me?!

226
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,002
Kung Fu.

227
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:47,859
What do we learn here?

228
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,293
No weakness! No pain! No mercy!

229
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,106
Begin!

230
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,235
- Mom, mom, c'mon, let's go. C'mon, mom!
- What? Dre, we just got here.

231
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:16,200
- Dre, what's going on?
- Nothing.

232
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:19,521
- Dre, what happened?
- Nothing happened.

233
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:23,669
What is it, you don't want to take that class?
Whatever Dre, What happened?

234
00:30:23,894 --> 00:30:28,625
We moved to China!
That's what happened!

235
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,968
Okay, stop.

236
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,816
Don't be like that, Dre.

237
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:52,795
What do you want me to do?

238
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:55,474
- We've been here less than a week...
- I feel like it's a year!

239
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:59,429
I hate it here.

240
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,295
Dre, please let me help you.

241
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,725
I can't help you if you don't tell
me what's wrong?! Oh, please.

242
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,383
You don't care what's wrong!

243
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:16,883
All you care about is how happy I am
and how great ice cream is.

244
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:21,336
I'm not happy.
I hate it here!

245
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:33,101
I want to go home!

246
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:39,516
Dre, we can't go home. Okay?
There is nothing left for us in Detroit.

247
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:42,590
This is what we've got.

248
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:46,939
This is home.

249
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,329
<i>Gather on here.</i>

250
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,967
<i>Welcome to one of the most popular
landmarks in all over China.</i>

251
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:20,022
<i>It is visited by millions of people
every year.</i>

252
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,068
<i>The Forbidden City.</i>

253
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:01,550
You plaster on for good luck.

254
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:23,635
- I wish someone would just...
- Yeah, me too.

255
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:28,404
- Just tell someone.
- Yeah, I got it.

256
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,884
Thanks a lot.

257
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:43,556
<i>The walls of the palace were reinforced
with the bricks, 15 layers deep,</i>

258
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:46,788
<i>to prevent anyone
from coming in.</i>

259
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:54,123
- Mr. Parker... Is everything okay?
- Oh yes?

260
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:59,751
Um...Yes, thank you.

261
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:00,619
Get him.

262
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:06,667
Come on.

263
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:43,370
You're fast.

264
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,658
But not fast enough.

265
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:05,536
He's had enough.

266
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:06,784
Don't you remember what we learned?

267
00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:07,726
No weakness. No pain.

268
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:12,189
No mercy!

269
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:14,301
Go home.

270
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:38,489
- What's up with the light bulbs, Mr. Han?
- Shh!

271
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:17,550
I thought you are just a maintenance man?

272
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:21,142
You've seen only with your eyes,
so you are easy to fool.

273
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:25,938
It doesn't hurt.

274
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:28,382
Chauva.
Ancient Chinese healing.

275
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,261
How did you do that up there? You like even
didn't punch them. They...beat each other up.

276
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:36,614
When fighting angry, blind men...

277
00:41:36,615 --> 00:41:39,645
best we just stay out of the way.

278
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:45,327
- So, where did you learn Kung Fu?
- From father.

279
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:47,922
Have you ever taught anybody?

280
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,765
No.

281
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:53,841
Would you?

282
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,723
- Depends.
- On what?

283
00:41:56,724 --> 00:42:00,703
- Reason.
- What about to kick somebody's ass?

284
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:06,725
The best fights are the ones we avoid.

285
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:09,443
What if I wanna avoid getting
my ass kicked?

286
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,504
- Stop saying "ass".
- Sorry.

287
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:19,708
Kung Fu is for knowledge, defense.

288
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:22,792
Not to make war,
but to create peace.

289
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,795
That's not definitely what they're taught.

290
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:29,392
No such thing as bad student,
only bad teacher.

291
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:34,529
That's great. I guess we'll just stroll in
their school and talk to their teacher.

292
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:37,358
- Good idea.
- No, bad idea.

293
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:39,621
If I go in there, I get my ass kick...

294
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,708
- I'll get beat up.
- You got beat up anyway.

295
00:42:50,216 --> 00:42:52,956
Would you go with me?

296
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,372
No, sorry.

297
00:42:57,128 --> 00:43:00,468
- But you said it was a good idea.
- For you, bad idea for me.

298
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:04,190
C'mon, it's not like you should be busy
or anything...I don't even speak Chinese.

299
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:07,138
Very sorry.

300
00:43:12,028 --> 00:43:16,334
Okay...Whatever.

301
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:33,250
Wait!

302
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:14,536
What are you doing?
Why did you stop?

303
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:18,149
Finish!

304
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:24,383
Okay, Mr. Han, let's get out of here.

305
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:31,273
We do not stop when our enemy is down!

306
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:33,378
No mercy.

307
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:35,329
No mercy in the studio.

308
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:38,112
No mercy in life.

309
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:44,978
What are you looking at?

310
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:48,027
He's the one that attacked me.

311
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:03,131
We are here to make peace.

312
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:06,461
Let your little thing mind himself.

313
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:13,796
One to one, no problem...Six to one,
too much to ask of anyone.

314
00:45:14,322 --> 00:45:16,770
I see.

315
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:19,287
Prepare for match!

316
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:24,932
Whoa Mr. Han, does he want us to fight?

317
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:30,533
We are not here to fight.

318
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:37,865
You attack my students
and disrespect my studio?!

319
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:41,622
You want to leave?
Not so easy.

320
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:45,393
Master Li...

321
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,093
You both came here.

322
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:54,344
One of you fights now.

323
00:45:58,316 --> 00:46:02,188
The boy will fight there.

324
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,767
OPEN KUNG FU TOURNAMENT

325
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:17,526
We accept your challenge.

326
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:24,126
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

327
00:46:25,403 --> 00:46:27,456
Attention!

328
00:46:29,944 --> 00:46:32,859
From now on the little thing
is to be left alone...

329
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,853
until the tournament.

330
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:37,903
- Understood?!
- Yes!

331
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:46,659
If he does not show up
for the competition...

332
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,502
I will bring pain to him and you.

333
00:47:01,544 --> 00:47:04,561
So, that go pretty much
how you planned it?

334
00:47:04,837 --> 00:47:06,655
There's good news and bad news.

335
00:47:06,676 --> 00:47:09,755
The good news is they promised
to leave you alone.

336
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:13,643
- Really?
- While you prepare.

337
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,277
Prepare for what?

338
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:20,603
The tournament.
You'll fight them all, one by one.

339
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,342
Huh?

340
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:27,891
So the bad news is now
they get to beat me up in public.

341
00:47:27,926 --> 00:47:31,191
- Yes.
- Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

342
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,916
They're gonna kill me.
You saw their Kung Fu.

343
00:47:34,206 --> 00:47:37,834
That's not Kung Fu. That does not
represent China.

344
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:42,077
That bad man teach them really bad
things that hurt, a lot.

345
00:47:44,683 --> 00:47:49,304
More good news.
I will teach you real Kung Fu.

346
00:47:51,922 --> 00:47:53,769
Yes.

347
00:48:02,457 --> 00:48:07,232
- See you later, mom.
- Hey, wait. This is early for you for a Saturday.

348
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:10,235
- Mr. Han will teach me Kung Fu.
- The maintenance man?

349
00:48:10,236 --> 00:48:12,599
It's China mom,
everybody knows Kung Fu.

350
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,069
Dre, you know how do I feel about
your fighting.

351
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,494
Kung Fu is not fight mom, it's about
making peace with your enemy.

352
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:20,472
- Be careful, Dre.
- Yeah.

353
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:59,600
Mr. Han?

354
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:23,842
- Mr. Han?
- Back here.

355
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:29,037
You know you have a car
in your living room, Mr. Han?

356
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:36,075
Okay, I was thinking about yesterday. I know
I was kinda freaking out about the tournament...

357
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:38,444
but I realized something last night.

358
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:44,120
I'm an athlete. My number one asset
is I'm fast, okay?!

359
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:48,447
I'm quick. I'm quick.
Got the speed. Cat speed.

360
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:52,395
You see? I'm quick yeah, you see?
In the US, I used to take gymnastic at PAL,

361
00:49:52,396 --> 00:49:54,508
that's Police Athletic League, to check it,
right?

362
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:58,857
Boom. You see that?

363
00:50:01,353 --> 00:50:05,420
My Uncle Reymi used to date that
Brazilian girl and he learned Jiu-Jitsu.

364
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:08,409
And he taught some of it to me.
As like, locks and holds and stuff, it's okay.

365
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,821
Attack me.

366
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:18,570
You see that? Feel that?
I can break it.

367
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:21,582
I'm choosing not to.
To press your luck. It's dangerous.

368
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,264
And he also taught me Capoeira so...

369
00:50:24,265 --> 00:50:27,652
Can't touch me. Can't touch...

370
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:34,153
Was that antique?

371
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,358
Pick up your jacket.

372
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:42,623
So basically Mr. Han,
what I'm trying to say is...

373
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:46,323
I got a good foundation here.
You know, like I said. I'm just...

374
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:49,858
Might not be as hard to teach me
as other people, you know.

375
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:52,048
- Hang it up.
- Okay.

376
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:57,235
- Happy now?
- Take it down.

377
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:02,639
- You just...
- Take it down.

378
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,360
Put it on.

379
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,276
Take it off.

380
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,395
- I already did all of this.
- Take it off.

381
00:51:16,404 --> 00:51:17,794
Can you just tell me,
why I'm doing this?

382
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:19,794
Take it off.

383
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,422
Hang it up.

384
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:31,036
Take it down.

385
00:51:31,037 --> 00:51:33,516
Put it on the ground.

386
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,064
Pick it up.

387
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:39,267
Hang up.

388
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,806
Take it down.

389
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,810
Put it on.

390
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:49,213
Take it off.

391
00:51:50,112 --> 00:51:52,400
Put it on the ground.

392
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:54,830
Pick it up.

393
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:57,607
Hang it up.

394
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,541
Take it down.
Put it on.

395
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:05,538
Take it off.

396
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,738
Hang it up.

397
00:52:16,707 --> 00:52:21,453
Mr. Han, why do you have
a car in your living room?

398
00:52:21,454 --> 00:52:24,259
No street parking.

399
00:52:30,855 --> 00:52:33,112
Hey!

400
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:37,297
So how did it go?
What you learned?

401
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:39,999
Nothing.

402
00:53:13,227 --> 00:53:16,016
Uniform on Uniform day.

403
00:53:16,017 --> 00:53:20,790
- You're fighting in the tournament?
- Yeah, how did you hear?

404
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:22,536
Everybody knows.

405
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:31,238
- I hope you have a good teacher.
- Yeah, me too.

406
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:33,539
He's a maintenance man.

407
00:53:33,787 --> 00:53:36,049
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

408
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:42,173
Well, I know you're practicing, and I think I'm practicing, I mean,
I don't know what I'm doing...

409
00:53:42,174 --> 00:53:48,453
- But, we both kind of practicing, you know and...
- Are you going to that Shi-Shi festival?

410
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:54,276
Yeah, I mean, I've missed
the Shi-Di Festival since I've been in China.

411
00:53:56,471 --> 00:54:02,347
- Go to the Shaolin theater.
- Okay. You want me to meet you?

412
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:09,123
Oh, oh, so like Shaolin theater, okay Shi-Fi-Shi festival.
Shaolin theater, okay. Cool.

413
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:13,747
- When is it again?
- Tomorrow. The show starts at seven.

414
00:54:13,774 --> 00:54:18,896
Okay. So tomorrow, Shaolin theater.
Shi-Shi festival at seven.

415
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:21,794
- See you tomorrow.
- Shi-Shi festival.

416
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:25,403
- Festival. - Shi-Shi festival.
- Okay. - Okay.

417
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,452
Mr. Han?

418
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:53,060
- Mr. Han, can I come in?
- You may come in.

419
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:59,857
Where's your jacket?

420
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:05,089
- I thought, I was warmin' up without it.
- Go get it.

421
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,284
You want me to go
all way back, just to get it?

422
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,504
Yes, all the way back
where you hide it.

423
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:39,678
- This is not right.
- What? I'm doing it.

424
00:55:41,532 --> 00:55:43,796
No.

425
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:45,999
- Something is missing.
- Nothing is missing.

426
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,861
You forgot, this.

427
00:55:58,782 --> 00:56:00,591
Attitude.

428
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:03,810
Shake it off.

429
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:12,122
Attitude.
Yes, that's it.

430
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:16,279
Okay, Mr. Han. I get it. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have treated my mom like that.

431
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,837
You're right.

432
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:25,607
- Put it on the ground.
- Hello.

433
00:56:26,129 --> 00:56:30,248
Ow, hey mom.
Um, did you get the tickets?

434
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:36,284
Yes, I got the tickets,
and I got an extra one for Mr. Han.

435
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:39,938
- But I didn't say...
- Dre, stop it.

436
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:43,600
Mr. Han, would you like to go with us
to the Shi-Shi festival?

437
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:46,711
No, thank you.
Too many people.

438
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:50,930
- Yeah, mom. Way too many people.
- Yeah, but I already bought the tickets.

439
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:53,679
- I don't go...
- Mr. Han, I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

440
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,493
You'll have fun. You need
to get out the house, okay?

441
00:56:56,494 --> 00:57:00,004
Here are your clothes, Dre.
Come on, hurry up and change.

442
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:04,694
Dre...

443
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:08,987
Pick up your jacket!

444
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,108
You were right Mr. Han,
there are a lot of people here.

445
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:26,108
Chinese Valentine's Day.

446
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:44,137
Yeah, Mom. I'm going to go get something
to eat, then going to go to the bathroom.

447
00:57:44,138 --> 00:57:46,385
Be back, right here,
in 20 minutes.

448
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:51,233
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Be careful. 20 minutes.

449
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,200
- 20.
- Okay.

450
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:47,241
I got this, and this for you.

451
00:58:47,242 --> 00:58:51,872
I downloaded this.
It has a very cool violins stuff, and I...

452
00:58:51,873 --> 00:58:55,797
I thought maybe you could play along and...
It's not like Bach and...

453
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:59,197
but, I thought maybe
you'd like it and...

454
00:59:23,598 --> 00:59:29,097
- So, um, do you have any kids?
- No.

455
00:59:30,456 --> 00:59:33,168
Oh, how's Dre doing?

456
00:59:33,283 --> 00:59:37,086
- Um, Shao Dre making a progress.
- Shao Dre?

457
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:40,157
Yes, Chinese pollito.

458
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:44,867
So, um, how many students do you have?

459
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,295
- Including Shao Dre?
- Yeah.

460
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,182
One.

461
00:59:57,053 --> 00:59:59,608
So, what's the show about?

462
01:00:01,478 --> 01:00:04,078
It's the story of the Goddess...

463
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,634
and a boy she loves.

464
01:00:06,756 --> 01:00:10,334
I love this story.

465
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:15,180
Her mother does not approve of him.

466
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:22,268
So, she cuts a wide river in the sky
to separate them forever.

467
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:26,868
But once a year,
all the birds in the sky...

468
01:00:27,197 --> 01:00:32,111
felt sad for them,
and they form a bridge.

469
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:40,559
So the two of them may be
together for a single night.

470
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:50,620
I'll be there at you audition,
if you come to my tournament.

471
01:00:51,045 --> 01:00:54,580
- Okay, I'll be there.
- Pinky swear.

472
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:58,282
See, you wrap your hands like this.

473
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:03,571
I swear that I'll be there at your audition,
no matter what happens.

474
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:09,041
And I promise to cheer bigger
than anyone else when you win.

475
01:01:45,056 --> 01:01:47,336
What up, Mr. Han?

476
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:50,849
Did I say come in?

477
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,045
Um, I think you did. I mean...

478
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:01,892
- Mr. Han, can I please come in?
- Yes.

479
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:08,061
- So, what we are doing today?
- Same.

480
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:06,229
Mr. Han, I told you. I get it, okay?
Be respectful! I got it!

481
01:03:06,544 --> 01:03:11,186
I put my jacket on a thousand times,
and I took it off a thousand times, okay?

482
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,810
This is stupid. I'm done!

483
01:03:13,811 --> 01:03:16,496
Let them beat me up,
if they want to.

484
01:03:17,354 --> 01:03:21,830
You know why you only have
one student? 'Cause you don't know Kung Fu.

485
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:25,290
- Shao Dre!
- What?

486
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,332
Come here.

487
01:03:39,731 --> 01:03:43,505
- Jacket on!
- Mr. Han, I already...- Jacket on!

488
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:56,954
- Jacket on!
- I don't have a jacket...- Jacket on!

489
01:04:03,496 --> 01:04:05,803
Be strong.

490
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:08,248
Jacket on.

491
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,197
Firm.

492
01:04:11,674 --> 01:04:13,876
Jacket off.

493
01:04:15,163 --> 01:04:17,159
Remember...

494
01:04:17,173 --> 01:04:21,927
always strong...
Jacket off.

495
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:27,412
Strong.

496
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,888
Left foot back.
Right foot back.

497
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:33,130
Left foot back.
Pick up your jacket!

498
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:37,490
- Whoa, Mr. ...- Focus!
- Okay. - Always concentrate.

499
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,926
Left back. Right foot back.
Pick up your jacket!

500
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:44,490
Stay.

501
01:04:46,067 --> 01:04:48,736
Pick up your jacket.

502
01:04:52,196 --> 01:04:53,715
Strong.

503
01:04:53,749 --> 01:04:55,518
Hang it up.

504
01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:57,435
Hang it up.

505
01:04:58,402 --> 01:05:00,772
And attitude!

506
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:03,297
Strike!

507
01:05:03,298 --> 01:05:05,652
Hang up and attitude!

508
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:08,733
Harder.
Harder.

509
01:05:10,932 --> 01:05:14,862
Good, but no face.

510
01:05:15,154 --> 01:05:17,237
Jacket off!

511
01:05:38,218 --> 01:05:42,149
Kung Fu lives in everything
we do, Shao Dre.

512
01:05:42,328 --> 01:05:47,241
It lives in how we put on a jacket,
and how we take off the jacket.

513
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:50,446
It lives in
how we treat people.

514
01:05:51,942 --> 01:05:57,177
Everything is Kung Fu.

515
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:44,196
- So, why do not we take the Shiroko?
- I don't drive the Shiroko.

516
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:50,177
- Do you have a license?
- Yes.

517
01:06:50,178 --> 01:06:55,800
So you have a license and a car
and we're in the train?

518
01:06:56,562 --> 01:06:59,956
- Please, be quiet.
- I'm just sayin'...

519
01:06:59,957 --> 01:07:03,967
seems like we could've saved
a lot of money, don't you think?

520
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:10,629
- Do you always ask these many questions?
- I'm sorry.

521
01:07:11,353 --> 01:07:14,143
So, what we are learning today?

522
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:17,744
Chi.

523
01:07:18,177 --> 01:07:24,628
Eternal Energy.
The essence of life.

524
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:28,682
It moves inside of us,
flows through our bodies.

525
01:07:28,683 --> 01:07:31,802
Give us power from within.

526
01:07:36,156 --> 01:07:39,969
I get it,
like the "Force" from Star Wars.

527
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:45,367
You're Yoda,
and I'm like... I'm like a Jedi.

528
01:08:16,215 --> 01:08:19,833
- Is this where you learned Kung Fu?
- Yes.

529
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:24,045
Everything good about me
was born here.

530
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:28,192
So Dre, you gotta leave your backpack
and skateboard here.

531
01:08:28,193 --> 01:08:31,559
- So, where are we going?
- The journey to the top of the mountain.

532
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,310
Tomb of the Dragon Well.

533
01:08:36,462 --> 01:08:42,407
Dragon Well? It's probably,
closer than it is, I'm looking at it.

534
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:45,653
Right?

535
01:09:11,908 --> 01:09:15,799
- Are we there yet?
- Soon.

536
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:21,564
- How do you say water in Chinese?
- Shui.

537
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:24,189
I need some shui.

538
01:09:24,469 --> 01:09:28,551
I'm really thirsty.

539
01:09:31,686 --> 01:09:36,638
- I'm thirsty, Mr. Han.
- Water on top of the mountain.

540
01:11:48,455 --> 01:11:50,931
Shao Dre.

541
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:02,144
The journey is complete.

542
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:09,895
- This is the Dragon Well?
- Yes.

543
01:12:14,035 --> 01:12:19,086
I stood here with my father,
when I was your age.

544
01:12:19,087 --> 01:12:23,804
He told me that's the magic
Kung Fu water.

545
01:12:31,957 --> 01:12:36,093
You drink and nothing
can defeat you.

546
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:50,309
It's the best water I've ever tasted.

547
01:12:51,773 --> 01:12:55,476
- Did you see the lady with the snake?
- Yes.

548
01:12:55,477 --> 01:12:58,065
She was doing the Cobra thing.
She was like...

549
01:12:58,117 --> 01:13:02,159
copying the snake. And it was like...
right here, and she was like...

550
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:07,396
You did not watch closely enough,
Shao Dre.

551
01:13:07,556 --> 01:13:10,438
The snake was copying the woman.

552
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:14,354
What? I don't get it.

553
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:24,132
Look.

554
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:30,530
- What do you see?
- Me, well my reflection. - Yes.

555
01:13:32,195 --> 01:13:36,408
- Now, what do you see?
- It's blurry. - Yes.

556
01:13:36,409 --> 01:13:41,431
That woman was sliced through water
quiet and calm.

557
01:13:41,432 --> 01:13:44,145
In here and in here.

558
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:50,578
So, the snake reflects her action,
like still water.

559
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:53,084
- Like a mirror?
- Yes.

560
01:13:54,745 --> 01:13:58,330
So, she controlled a snake
by doing nothing?

561
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:05,415
Being still and doing nothing,
are two very different things.

562
01:14:08,604 --> 01:14:11,957
- She used her Chi on that snake, didn't she?
- Very good.

563
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:15,570
You gotta teach me that.
How to control people.

564
01:14:15,589 --> 01:14:19,960
There is only one person
you need to learn how to control.

565
01:14:22,896 --> 01:14:25,342
Who?

566
01:14:25,343 --> 01:14:29,411
Empty your mind.
Flow with my movement.

567
01:14:29,412 --> 01:14:32,271
Connect to the energy,
around you.

568
01:14:32,307 --> 01:14:37,020
- I kinda just want to learn the cobra thing.
- Cobra takes a lifetime.

569
01:14:37,021 --> 01:14:40,675
- Requires great focus.
- But I have great focus?!

570
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,968
- Oh my God. Mr. Han...
- Your focus,

571
01:14:46,969 --> 01:14:51,038
- needs more focus.
- Mr. Han...

572
01:15:27,634 --> 01:15:30,302
Thank you, Mr. Han.

573
01:15:50,304 --> 01:15:54,028
There's no such thing
as fortune cookies in China.

574
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:56,577
Dre, please be careful
crossing the street.

575
01:15:56,589 --> 01:16:03,054
You just scared the life out of me,
the other day. They have the "right-of-way".

576
01:16:05,668 --> 01:16:08,056
And the symbols. I can't get
the symbols right on the bathrooms.

577
01:16:08,347 --> 01:16:10,929
And I'm still walkin' into the men's restroom.

578
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:13,807
The other day I walked in,
there was this 90 years old Chinese man,

579
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:15,706
he thought he was getting a little treat.

580
01:16:15,707 --> 01:16:19,686
Dre, please stop that! You look crazy!
Here, eat your noodles!

581
01:16:41,953 --> 01:16:44,989
Mr. Han,
what's goin' on?

582
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:48,951
Anticipation.

583
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:51,191
I can't see...

584
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,361
Don't see it, feel it.

585
01:16:53,535 --> 01:16:55,344
Dammit, Mr. Han!

586
01:16:55,722 --> 01:16:57,963
I felt that one!

587
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:03,229
- Mr. Han.
- What?

588
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:12,440
- Concentrate, okay?
- Okay. Do I get the stick now?

589
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:35,937
- Dre, you okay?
- I'm okay.

590
01:17:39,477 --> 01:17:42,469
What's up Mr. Han, what time
we are trainin' tomorrow?

591
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:45,521
Shao Dre, we are not training tomorrow.

592
01:17:45,547 --> 01:17:47,080
Why not?

593
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,240
- Wu chi pi fan
- Wu chi pi fan?

594
01:17:51,241 --> 01:17:54,480
It means: "Too much of something
is not good."

595
01:17:54,481 --> 01:17:56,998
You train a lot, you need to rest.

596
01:17:57,008 --> 01:18:01,517
A day off?
Yes, Mr. Han! Yes!

597
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:04,996
Shao Dre needs to rest.
Yes, Mr. Han.

598
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:11,053
You rest, too.
I love you, Mr. Han. Peace!

599
01:18:27,091 --> 01:18:28,976
Are you okay?

600
01:18:28,994 --> 01:18:33,446
- My audition is tomorrow at a six.
- Isn't it what you've been practicing for?

601
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:38,209
- Yes, of course.
- Don't worry, you got it.

602
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:41,277
What if they don't pick me?

603
01:18:43,398 --> 01:18:45,290
Meiying, wait!

604
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,775
First of all,
I'm going to be there with you.

605
01:18:48,783 --> 01:18:52,944
And B, all you have to do is what your
teacher says. Play the pauses.

606
01:18:52,945 --> 01:18:55,223
It's easy, watch.

607
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,774
You see?

608
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:04,348
- I have to practice.
- Wait.

609
01:19:04,349 --> 01:19:05,815
Wu gi bi fan.

610
01:19:05,816 --> 01:19:06,870
What?

611
01:19:06,871 --> 01:19:08,785
I'm sorry,
I don't think you don't speak Chinese.

612
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:14,136
Wu gi bi fan.
Too much of good stuff is a bad stuff?

613
01:19:14,137 --> 01:19:16,359
Ow...Wu chi pi fan.

614
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,545
Yeah.
Wu gi bi FUN.

615
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:23,108
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

616
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:26,093
Have you ever been to the gym?
C'mon, we are going to have some fun.

617
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:29,961
Come on, I know you want
to go have some fun!

618
01:19:56,667 --> 01:20:00,303
Okay, that's going to give you
some serious gas.

619
01:20:13,845 --> 01:20:16,714
- What do you see?
- Me.

620
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:20,938
- Now, what do you see?
- Me.

621
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,311
Go, come on.

622
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:54,311
<i>You're dancing machine.
That was pretty good!<i/></i>

623
01:20:56,110 --> 01:21:00,000
<i>Here comes, round two.<i/></i>

624
01:21:48,858 --> 01:21:50,747
<i>You're hot.<i/></i>

625
01:21:55,604 --> 01:22:00,550
-That's like American dancing.
Like, you should have a group. -No.

626
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:06,288
With like, other people in it
dancing behind you, doin' the same stuff.

627
01:22:17,323 --> 01:22:21,080
- The audition, it was changed to today.
- But they said, it's tomorrow.

628
01:22:21,081 --> 01:22:23,819
Something happened.
It is in 20 minutes.

629
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:27,184
My father is coming to get me.

630
01:25:21,702 --> 01:25:25,910
Hey, she's like totally going to get it, right,
because that was just great.

631
01:25:58,712 --> 01:26:01,942
Hey! That was fantastic.

632
01:26:01,943 --> 01:26:05,628
That was... You just...
You played so beautifully, and...

633
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:09,022
We can no longer be friends.

634
01:26:09,652 --> 01:26:13,060
You are bad for my life.

635
01:26:25,065 --> 01:26:27,938
See you at the tournament.

636
01:26:28,378 --> 01:26:31,495
Don't be late for that.

637
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:16,720
Mr. Han!
Mr. Han!

638
01:27:21,934 --> 01:27:24,457
We'll not train today.

639
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:44,459
- What are you doing?
- It's July 8th.

640
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,680
Why did you wreck the car?

641
01:29:13,048 --> 01:29:16,191
His name was Kang Kang.

642
01:29:16,329 --> 01:29:19,942
Shao Dre, how old are you?

643
01:29:19,943 --> 01:29:22,227
Twelve.

644
01:29:22,285 --> 01:29:24,997
He was ten.

645
01:29:26,054 --> 01:29:29,081
He was so beautiful.

646
01:29:31,143 --> 01:29:34,702
Her name was Xiang.

647
01:29:35,273 --> 01:29:38,774
She was a singer.

648
01:29:40,824 --> 01:29:44,164
Not professional.

649
01:29:45,206 --> 01:29:48,422
She sang only for me.

650
01:30:24,097 --> 01:30:26,611
What happened?

651
01:30:34,049 --> 01:30:37,038
There was a steep hill.

652
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:40,050
Lots of rain.

653
01:30:40,647 --> 01:30:44,950
The car, it just...

654
01:30:45,553 --> 01:30:48,522
I was driving.

655
01:30:48,523 --> 01:30:51,914
We argued about something.

656
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:55,175
I was so angry.

657
01:30:55,545 --> 01:30:57,904
I lost control.

658
01:30:58,297 --> 01:31:01,803
I try to remember...

659
01:31:01,804 --> 01:31:04,987
but I can not remember what we're
argued about.

660
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:09,442
I hope it was something important.

661
01:31:12,337 --> 01:31:16,762
Every year, I fix the car.

662
01:31:17,537 --> 01:31:21,361
But still fix nothing.

663
01:35:59,113 --> 01:36:01,338
Mr. Han!

664
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:53,943
Win or lose, doesn't matter.
Fight hard.

665
01:37:54,783 --> 01:37:58,634
Earn respect.
The boys leave you alone.

666
01:38:02,096 --> 01:38:05,005
I have a present for you.

667
01:38:09,905 --> 01:38:11,634
Oh! Mr. Han.

668
01:38:12,996 --> 01:38:15,239
This is the one Bruce Lee had.

669
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:17,303
Great.

670
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:19,919
Thank you.

671
01:38:22,572 --> 01:38:26,659
You have taught me
a very important lesson, Shao Dre.

672
01:38:27,799 --> 01:38:36,177
Life will knock us down, but we can
choose, whether or not,  to get back up.

673
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:41,987
You're the best friend
I've ever had, Mr. Han.

674
01:38:58,033 --> 01:39:01,137
Okay.

675
01:39:03,558 --> 01:39:07,187
Wait!
Can you help me with something?

676
01:39:11,384 --> 01:39:12,957
Dre?

677
01:39:13,043 --> 01:39:16,661
Is your dad home?

678
01:39:19,973 --> 01:39:21,168
Sir...

679
01:39:21,941 --> 01:39:24,645
My name is Dre Parker.

680
01:39:24,655 --> 01:39:31,909
My actions have brought
dishonor to your family.

681
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:36,820
Your daughter has been
a great friend to me.

682
01:39:36,821 --> 01:39:39,862
And from her I have learned...

683
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:42,600
...that a true friend...

684
01:39:42,604 --> 01:39:45,685
...is a person
who makes your life better.

685
01:39:45,732 --> 01:39:50,507
But, if you give me a second chance...

686
01:39:50,585 --> 01:39:54,234
...I promise that I will be...

687
01:39:54,235 --> 01:40:01,851
...the best friend your
daughter has ever had.

688
01:40:04,715 --> 01:40:07,584
That's it.

689
01:40:21,347 --> 01:40:26,879
My daughter told me that she made
a promise to be at your tournament.

690
01:40:26,918 --> 01:40:31,280
In our family,
we do not break our promises.

691
01:40:34,302 --> 01:40:36,200
Good luck!

692
01:40:38,042 --> 01:40:39,802
Thank you.

693
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,146
Rock and roll.

694
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:16,020
Let the tournament begin!

695
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,690
Shao Dre, you're up.

696
01:41:51,216 --> 01:41:53,537
- What's that?
- The rule book.

697
01:41:54,026 --> 01:41:57,479
- You don't know the rules?
- Of course I know the rules, it's simple.

698
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,714
You hit him,
and don't let him hit you.

699
01:41:59,755 --> 01:42:01,423
What?

700
01:42:01,564 --> 01:42:04,111
Mr. Han, they're going to kill me.

701
01:42:05,633 --> 01:42:11,804
Two points to win. Win it two times.
Go. Focus. Focus.

702
01:42:40,226 --> 01:42:42,358
That's a warning.
You cannot run off the mat.

703
01:42:42,366 --> 01:42:45,337
Next time you lose a point.
Go.

704
01:42:45,338 --> 01:42:48,618
- Be strong.
- Come on, Dre.

705
01:43:21,564 --> 01:43:24,863
- Good job. Next time, no face.
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.

706
01:43:24,864 --> 01:43:27,040
The next point winner.

707
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:29,111
Come on, baby.

708
01:46:09,843 --> 01:46:14,167
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!

709
01:46:14,715 --> 01:46:18,562
From now on, the semi-final matches,
three points to win.

710
01:46:18,563 --> 01:46:20,446
Be kinda hot if I
won this thing, huh, Mr. Han?

711
01:46:20,483 --> 01:46:25,707
- Be kinda hot if you focused.
- Yeah, well, after that.

712
01:46:33,382 --> 01:46:38,041
<i>And now the 1st semi-final
of the evening.</i>

713
01:46:38,042 --> 01:46:39,541
TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS
SEMI-FINAL

714
01:46:40,068 --> 01:46:42,096
First round:
Cheng Vs. Wu Ping.

715
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:19,697
Cheng advances to final.

716
01:48:31,985 --> 01:48:36,452
Next semi-final:
Introducing Fighting Dragon Liang...

717
01:48:37,781 --> 01:48:42,522
...and the surprising finalist, Dre Parker.

718
01:48:49,775 --> 01:48:53,352
Empty your mind. Focus.

719
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:52,070
You're disqualified!

720
01:49:57,949 --> 01:50:00,360
Are you okay?

721
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:17,784
He's done.

722
01:50:17,785 --> 01:50:23,579
I'm sorry, you should not continue.
You've brought honor to your family.

723
01:50:25,062 --> 01:50:29,235
The doctor says, you did great.

724
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,450
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

725
01:50:44,066 --> 01:50:47,237
Dre Parker has 2 minutes to
return to the match.

726
01:50:47,238 --> 01:50:49,947
If he's unable to return...

727
01:50:49,948 --> 01:50:54,505
...the Fighting Dragons
win by default.

728
01:50:55,710 --> 01:50:58,381
Can you guys give us a second?

729
01:50:59,203 --> 01:51:04,795
Yeah, okay. Sure baby,
whatever you need.

730
01:51:11,584 --> 01:51:14,492
Do you think I could have won?

731
01:51:14,787 --> 01:51:17,737
Win or lose doesn't matter,
Shao Dre.

732
01:51:18,447 --> 01:51:21,198
You know that's not what I mean.

733
01:51:24,478 --> 01:51:29,746
Yes, I think you had a good chance.

734
01:51:31,499 --> 01:51:34,929
So, let's do the fiery cup thing.

735
01:51:36,852 --> 01:51:41,863
You don't need to fight anymore.
You have proven everything you need to prove.

736
01:51:41,864 --> 01:51:45,273
What, that I can get
beat up easy, and then quit?

737
01:51:45,274 --> 01:51:48,167
That's not balance,
that's not real Kung Fu.

738
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:54,063
You said, when life knocks you down,
you could choose whether or not to get back up.

739
01:51:54,064 --> 01:51:58,239
Well, I'm tryin' to get back up.
And why won't you help me?

740
01:52:00,403 --> 01:52:02,059
Because...

741
01:52:02,105 --> 01:52:06,272
I cannot watch you
get hurt anymore.

742
01:52:08,794 --> 01:52:13,250
Please, Mr. Han. Please.

743
01:52:13,973 --> 01:52:20,393
Just tell me, Shao Dre. Why?
Why you need to go back out there so badly?

744
01:52:21,708 --> 01:52:25,364
Because I'm still scared.

745
01:52:27,889 --> 01:52:32,358
No matter what happens tonight
when I leave...

746
01:52:32,548 --> 01:52:35,772
...I don't want to be scared anymore.

747
01:52:46,467 --> 01:52:52,698
Since Dre Parker has
not returned to the ring...

748
01:53:10,422 --> 01:53:14,932
Dre Parker will fight!

749
01:55:01,774 --> 01:55:04,164
Shao Dre?

750
01:55:19,706 --> 01:55:22,812
Come on, Dre.
You can do this, Dre.

751
01:56:57,393 --> 01:57:00,684
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

752
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:06,657
No mercy.

753
01:58:12,053 --> 01:58:17,205
The score is tied.
The next point wins!

754
02:01:00,806 --> 02:01:04,716
I'm so proud of you.
