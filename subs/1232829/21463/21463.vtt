1
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,657
I could have lied there forever,

2
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,799
but the phone rang.

3
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,695
Hey.

4
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,686
Hello.
Hello.

5
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,036
Good morning.

6
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:44,196
Is this Mr. Rosow?

7
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:44,906
Um.

8
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,076
Uh, Mr. Rosow?

9
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:46,925
Eh.

10
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:47,725
Yeah.

11
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:50,434
Hi, I'm Drexler Hewitt... an attorney.

12
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:51,635
I said, I'll pay the bill tomorrow.

13
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,735
I promise.

14
00:01:53,737 --> 00:01:54,626
No, no.

15
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:56,734
Not that kind... not that kind of attorney.

16
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,064
You're Mr. John Rosow...
aren't you the private investigator?

17
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,804
Mm.

18
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:01,745
Yup?

19
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,445
OK.

20
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:05,003
I want you to board the California Zephyr

21
00:02:04,996 --> 00:02:06,643
at 7 o'clock this morning.

22
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:09,583
There will be a middle aged man on board.

23
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:11,703
We've had someone tailing him from the east cost

24
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,644
and... well, it doesn't matter.

25
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:14,475
Now we need a fresh face.

26
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,261
You mean your spy got spot?

27
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:19,472
Yeah, I guess.

28
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:22,082
Now, we have reason to believe
the middle aged man... well,

29
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:24,053
the subject, let's call him.

30
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,093
He's on his way to Los Angeles.

31
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:26,073
I'd like you to follow him.

32
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:27,712
Wherever he goes, whatever he does, easy as pie.

33
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,251
Understood?
-Zephyr is wind, right?

34
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:32,742
I think it is.

35
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,901
Yeah.
Wind.

36
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:37,201
My secretarial will be coming by your office in 10 minutes.

37
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:41,349
And you can reach me here at this number, 24 hours a day.

38
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:42,772
I get paid for this?

39
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:47,039
Sure. $500 a day plus expenses, not including gin.

40
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:51,670
It says Banquo on my buzzer.

41
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:52,413
Oh.

42
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,502
I thought you were Rosow.

43
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:56,289
I thought you needed a PI.

44
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:58,140
TouchÃ©.

45
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,520
Let's try to level a retainer
and some expense money for you.

46
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:02,730
Hey coach, how'd you get my name and number?

47
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,160
Oh, a business associate

48
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:05,400
of ours with the NYPD.

49
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:08,059
A buddy of yours from your past life, Gus Papitos.

50
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,761
Good guy.

51
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:11,820
He was.
Yeah.

52
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:12,521
Pappy.

53
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,869
Pappy.

54
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,939
What exactly did he say?

55
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:18,768
Uh, just... we know your history,

56
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:20,500
Officer Rosow.

57
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,059
He was very complimentary.

58
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:25,217
Gus Pappy.
Funny guy.

59
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,910
Um, but...

60
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:26,640
Hold on.

61
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,100
He recommended you highly

62
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:30,129
and he feels that...

63
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:32,628
Who's there?

64
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:33,699
Miss Charley.

65
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,848
Miss Charley who?

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,577
Miss Charlie, an associate of Drexler Hewitt.

67
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,339
May I come in?

68
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:06,377
Take it easy, Dexter.

69
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:33,934
How did you get here so quick?

70
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:35,725
You were on a conference call.

71
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:37,755
I know how to keep quiet.

72
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:39,725
There was some guy in the building.

73
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:41,864
Opened the front door for me.

74
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,813
I bet he did.

75
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:48,932
It's a little early in the morning for flirting.

76
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:49,905
Uh.

77
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:50,954
Hey, you got a good arm.

78
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:57,213
You're pretty now, but you use to be a tom boy.

79
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,663
You got three older brothers.

80
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,453
Perceptive.

81
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:05,843
Yeah.

82
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:07,114
No, I played with dolls.

83
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:08,324
I was an only child.

84
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:09,044
Open the envelope.

85
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:28,632
He's got an OK face.

86
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:33,232
Chicago, LA.

87
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,971
Any other questions?
-Yeah.

88
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:37,751
What makes this Drexler Hewitt
think I'll tail this this guy

89
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,852
without any more information?

90
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:46,592
Good day, Mr. Rosow.

91
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:55,000
So far, I guess.

92
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:21,409
Where's Drexler?

93
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,199
I'm sorry,

94
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,238
Mr. Hewitt's in a meeting.

95
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,618
May I take a message?

96
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,359
Who's the kid?

97
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,148
I'm sorry?

98
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:26,779
Yeah.
Me, too.

99
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,539
Who's the kid?

100
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:28,898
I don't know what you're talking about.

101
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,027
You should have told me
this was one of those.

102
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:31,679
You'll have to talk

103
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,698
to Mr. Hewitt about this.

104
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:33,938
I can't help you.

105
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:34,778
Yeah.

106
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,657
I would've charged more if I knew.

107
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,228
He's hiding in plain sight.

108
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,436
His door's open like he's no more on the lam than I am.

109
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:42,266
I'll have Mr. Hewitt call you.

110
00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:43,706
Yeah, right.
Thanks.

111
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:15,936
It's allright.

112
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,411
What can I get you?

113
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,691
Sir?

114
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:56,253
Sir?

115
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:56,983
Hm?

116
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:59,402
Chicken, fish, or vegetable lasagna.

117
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:04,321
You pick one.

118
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:06,721
Chicken.

119
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:08,282
Martinis any good?

120
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:10,151
Well, you mix them yourself.

121
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:12,810
We have mini bottles.

122
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:17,669
One gin, one vermouth, with olives and ice.

123
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:20,740
Everything but the olives, sir.

124
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:21,722
Sorry about that.

125
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:50,900
The 8 o'clock

126
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,869
dinner is now being served.

127
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:56,987
8 o'clock dinner in the dining car is now being served.

128
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,817
And here's your pennant race update.

129
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,007
Manny Ramirez has tied the game with a home run.

130
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:12,949
Here.

131
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,176
OK.
Why don't you go this... come on.

132
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:33,147
Excuse me.

133
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:12,293
Hey you can't, uh...
you can't smoke in here.

134
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:13,973
Sorry about that.
I'm almost done.

135
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:22,721
We have to follow someone.

136
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,212
What is he, uh... he's a friend of yours?

137
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:26,763
What's the difference?

138
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:28,943
That, uh... we don't do that
kind of thing in LA, you know?

139
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:29,674
It's too much hassle.

140
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:36,933
Look.

141
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:41,423
OK.

142
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:42,662
But I have to report all this to the dispatcher,

143
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:44,622
and the dispatcher...
he has to report it to the police.

144
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:45,313
OK?

145
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:55,969
My guy's cab is pulling out.

146
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:56,732
You see it?

147
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,533
Yeah, I see it.

148
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:26,057
Hey, you think $20 buys you smoking privileges?

149
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:31,545
I don't hear you on the radio reporting any of this.

150
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,259
I pick my spots.

151
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,960
No hurry.

152
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,868
Looks to me like your friend is going to Santa Monica.

153
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,388
Do you know Saint Monica?

154
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,578
No.

155
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:53,954
She's the patron saint of widows, unhappy wives,

156
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,148
and mothers away with children.

157
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,895
Rosow, does

158
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,664
your cell phone have a camera?

159
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,965
A camera in my phone?

160
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,205
Would you please purchase one?

161
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:55,894
Mm.

162
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:57,524
Go to a cellphone store,

163
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,624
get a cell phone with a camera.

164
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,914
Send us photographs of the man you're following.

165
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,314
I don't have a computer.

166
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,784
You don't need one.

167
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:04,935
You send it through the cellphone,

168
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:06,124
the one you're going to buy.

169
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,691
And make sure to keep the receipt.

170
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,722
Uh, can I just, uh...

171
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:14,683
transmit an image of the receipt back

172
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,272
to you instead of keeping all the pieces

173
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:18,792
of paper all over the place?

174
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:20,193
All right, Rosow.

175
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:22,312
Transmit an image of the receipt.

176
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:23,993
Will my new cell phone receive images?

177
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,381
Why?

178
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,300
Oh, you've sparked my imagination, Charley.

179
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,591
-Hi.
-Hey.

180
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:53,720
I hear you have rooms here.

181
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:55,500
You have a reservation?

182
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,700
Unexpected visit.

183
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:58,371
-How many in your party?
-No parties.

184
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,649
How long will you be staying with us?

185
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:06,220
As long as he does.

186
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,750
As long as who does?

187
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,750
Uh, that man who just checked in.

188
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,750
He had a little boy with him.

189
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,789
So you know man,
or you know the kid?

190
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:17,271
Oh.

191
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,809
All right.

192
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:22,511
All right.

193
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:23,279
You know what?

194
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,938
I'm just going to be honest with you, Missy.

195
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,218
My name's not Missy.

196
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,819
Wh-what's your name?

197
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,379
Mabel.
-Mabel.

198
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,218
Right.

199
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,205
This man... the man who just checked in... he's

200
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,527
my best friend.

201
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,658
So?

202
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,319
I'm worried about him.

203
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,507
He drinks too much.

204
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,328
I see.

205
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:50,846
See what?

206
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,767
I have a friend in AA, is all.

207
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:54,657
Yeah.

208
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:59,444
Well, he's... I just want to be close to him so I

209
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,247
can hear if he needs some help.

210
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:04,634
I mean, really, I don't want to get you in...

211
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:05,877
Trouble's my middle name.

212
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:14,024
Room 101, right next door.

213
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:15,736
Thanks a lot.

214
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:16,707
I mean, really.

215
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:24,613
It's uh... it's an ugly thing.

216
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,725
Hey, I'm going to need a rental car.

217
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,046
Can you arrange that?

218
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:29,036
Done.

219
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:41,463
The merciless

220
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,693
pressures of warfare develop highly

221
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:46,663
specialized types of planes.

222
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:51,051
Dropping of grenades and hand bombs

223
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:56,480
lead to a new and terrible instrument of war, the bomber.

224
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:17,611
Javier, do you mind if I play some music?

225
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:26,652
Do you like jazz?

226
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:31,642
I love jazz.

227
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:41,618
When I traveled on business,
every city I'd go to

228
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:43,621
had a jazz club.

229
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,121
And I'd stay up all night.

230
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:49,627
And I couldn't go when I was home because my wife was only

231
00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:51,370
interested in classical music.

232
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:03,848
Ah, just listen to him play.

233
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:04,860
What power.

234
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:17,232
You love Stravinsky.

235
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:17,942
Who doesn't?

236
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:18,952
You know Stravinsky?

237
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:21,231
I do now, but you're still strangers.

238
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:22,382
Strangers?

239
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:23,322
No.

240
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:25,720
Chambers, Special Agent Ann Chambers.

241
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:28,380
This is my partner, Special Agent Tom R. Craig.

242
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:30,240
We've been watching you.

243
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:32,850
You have a sad disposition, Mr. Rosow.

244
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:35,070
Oh, sit still and let them examine you.

245
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:36,121
That's what I always say.

246
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:38,609
Well that's a really funny motto for a guy who's

247
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:41,170
always running from everything.

248
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,348
You know, you're going to be need some sunglasses out here.

249
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:47,398
We have a couple extras from our 7-Eleven excursion.

250
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:48,989
Would you like a pair?

251
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:50,370
You're not trying to bug me, are you?

252
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:51,670
No.

253
00:25:51,672 --> 00:25:54,688
We just got carried away at the 7-Eleven.

254
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,709
It's the Slurpees, right?

255
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:58,020
No, for you it's the beer.

256
00:25:58,021 --> 00:25:58,720
Be nice.

257
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:02,959
Here.

258
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,509
Yeah.
I got them for $2.

259
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,838
They shine in the dark.

260
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,550
Ah ha.

261
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,450
Brilliant.

262
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,348
Sunglasses that shine in the dark.

263
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,408
$2 though.

264
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:15,647
It's a hard deal to pass up.

265
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,467
Well gee, I get paid $1,000 a day to tail this guy.

266
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:19,169
How about you?

267
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,647
You know, some of us in here, Rosow, aren't

268
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,707
really doing it for the money.

269
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,846
So are you really a private detective?

270
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,208
That's what they tell me.

271
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:31,036
We were just talking about that.

272
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,944
We didn't know they still had those...
private detectives.

273
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:35,788
Well you know what?

274
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:37,797
If I call 911 and tell them I got

275
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,637
a couple of peeping toms in my alley,

276
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,978
we can make it really big scene.

277
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,495
Scare someone away.

278
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:44,406
Hmm.

279
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:47,894
You know, the thing is you
you... you really just don't know

280
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:49,157
what you're dealing with yet.

281
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:51,744
That's all.

282
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:53,426
My partner's right.

283
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:56,724
You better stay sober for this one.

284
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:58,936
Well, I'll drink to that when you two vamoose.

285
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:17,576
Good evening.

286
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:19,005
Hi, how are you?

287
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:20,814
What have you here?

288
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:23,473
I, uh... I hear they got phones that take pictures.

289
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,054
Oh yeah, we got plenty of those.

290
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:25,745
Oh yeah?

291
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,414
You saw the special though,
what happened, right?

292
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:28,324
-No, I didn't.
-OK.

293
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,834
We got plenty.
-Is this uh, balloons?

294
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:31,593
We got balloons.
It's a special everyday.

295
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:33,264
Especially for you.

296
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:34,783
Let's me just get some phones out for you.

297
00:27:34,775 --> 00:27:36,504
What... did you have anything in mind specifically?

298
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,673
Yeah.
A phone that takes pictures.

299
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:39,375
OK.

300
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,101
And now, I'd be cheating you if I didn't tell you that we

301
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,803
have top of the line phones.

302
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:45,373
George Lucas bought this one right here.

303
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,923
-George Lucas?
-He's a famous guy.

304
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:48,323
I don't know.
-Yeah.

305
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:49,842
He's a director, or producer, or something.

306
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:51,033
-What's your name?
-Me?

307
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,103
-Yeah.
-Boo Boo.

308
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:52,803
Boo Boo.

309
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:53,713
Yeah.

310
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:57,590
Uh, I just want a phone that takes pictures, Boo Boo.

311
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:58,284
OK.

312
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:06,792
Hey, don't you see the walkway there?

313
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:07,563
What?

314
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:08,773
There's a walkway over there.

315
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,451
You can't just cross wherever you want.

316
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:11,981
I could give you a ticket for jaywalking.

317
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,440
A ticket for jaywalking?

318
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,670
You mocking my job, dude?

319
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:17,363
No.

320
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:21,697
I mean, you're a cop, right?

321
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,231
Let me see your ID, please.

322
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:34,139
You're from New York?

323
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:36,809
Originally, yeah.

324
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,189
Now, we do things different here.

325
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:42,128
It's because of the earthquakes, right?

326
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:44,329
OK.
Lay off the jokes, guy.

327
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:47,258
Was that supposed to be a joke?

328
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:48,639
Sure.

329
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:51,158
Well, we're in Hollywood, OK?

330
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,956
We leave the entertainment to the super sales.

331
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:58,507
I suggest you go home.

332
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:00,837
There's no smoking on the promenade, fuck wad.

333
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,008
Jesus Christ.

334
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:29,966
It's from a woman at the bar.

335
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,336
She wants you to know her name is Lana.

336
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:47,946
May I?

337
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:01,364
Hey.

338
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:07,839
You're not one of those gals who
uses sex as a weapon, are you?

339
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:09,125
No.

340
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:11,034
I don't like violence.

341
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:14,183
That's good.

342
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:16,223
Are you like everyone else here?

343
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:19,252
You in show business?

344
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:20,744
No.

345
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:24,042
I'm in the hide and seek business.

346
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:26,652
No.
That is a game that kids play.

347
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:31,440
Yeah, but if you add some money to it, it's for adults.

348
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:33,712
And what are you doing right now?

349
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:35,173
Hiding or seeking?

350
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:39,792
Right now, I'm drinking.

351
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,722
Another drink for you?

352
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:06,631
No.
Come on.

353
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,621
-No.
-Come on.

354
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:11,110
I can't.

355
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:19,550
What's wrong, Mark?

356
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:07,426
Are these kind of games you're into?

357
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:09,227
No.

358
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,528
They're for work.

359
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,977
Come on.

360
00:32:11,978 --> 00:32:14,875
It's all right.

361
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:18,735
Want me to cuff you up, huh?

362
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:20,357
You want to cuff me up?
-All right.

363
00:32:20,358 --> 00:32:21,267
Oh.

364
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:44,342
-Ah.

365
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:45,855
Slow dance.

366
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:58,695
May I have this dance?

367
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:34,420
Lana.

368
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:38,200
I never did figure out if that was her real name.

369
00:33:38,194 --> 00:33:42,069
Maybe it was, just for the night.

370
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:43,881
She ended up passing out on a pillow

371
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:49,267
and sleep talking into the dawn.

372
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:52,399
She was asking her mother for the extra special blueberry

373
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:54,880
pancakes.

374
00:33:54,873 --> 00:33:56,361
There was a lot of cursing.

375
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:33,790
-Oh.

376
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,036
Hello, Drexler Hewitt's office.

377
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,566
Hey, Charley.

378
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:25,327
Is Hewitt in?

379
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,495
No, Rosow.

380
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:27,876
He is not.

381
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,975
I would have told him I'm still in contact

382
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:32,924
with the subject and the boy.

383
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:37,452
Presently tailing them south to Mexico, I'm guessing.

384
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:38,814
Guessing, Rosow?

385
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:39,795
Guessing, Miss.

386
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:40,166
Charley.

387
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,264
We haven't received the image yet.

388
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,875
Oh, yeah.

389
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:44,726
I forgot.

390
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:47,973
I'll do it right now.

391
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:51,912
This is instantaneous, right?

392
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:03,492
What is this?

393
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:04,195
Who is this?

394
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,453
It's just a trial run, Charley.

395
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:08,311
I just want to make sure the new technology really works.

396
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:10,112
Don't hang up on me, OK?

397
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,213
You're always hanging up on me.

398
00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:13,003
What do you want, Rosow?

399
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,701
Gee, I just want you to talk to me for a little while.

400
00:36:15,694 --> 00:36:18,212
And why would I do that?

401
00:36:18,214 --> 00:36:22,709
I'm here on the old, spooky desert

402
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,880
highway following some defected bastard

403
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:29,050
with a poor little Mexican boy.

404
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,652
You and me, we work together.

405
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,331
I figured you could find a couple of moments

406
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,041
to tell me something about yourself.

407
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:37,580
Tell you about myself?

408
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,542
Nothing too personal.

409
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:39,812
I'll tell you

410
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:41,501
one thing about myself, Rosow.
-Goody.

411
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:42,832
One thing only.

412
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,812
What is it?

413
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:46,100
I'm
hanging up the phone now.

414
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:52,472
Your loss.

415
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,970
Your loss.

416
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:06,809
This is some prime real estate.

417
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:07,756
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

418
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:16,615
It looks like you need a light, huh?

419
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:17,567
I got.

420
00:38:23,837 --> 00:38:26,045
Hero Furillo.
Hello.

421
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:32,204
-Yeah.
-Nice.

422
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,175
Uh, I already got customers.

423
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:37,875
I know.

424
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,485
So what do you want?

425
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,715
Where are you taking them?

426
00:38:50,154 --> 00:38:52,033
Please.

427
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:52,784
I'm working.

428
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:58,245
Nah, you keep it.

429
00:38:58,245 --> 00:39:00,911
You might want to call me sometime.

430
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:02,183
I got my cell phone on there.

431
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:03,812
Look, I got this new cellphone.

432
00:39:03,814 --> 00:39:04,764
It takes pictures.

433
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,422
What do you want with those two?

434
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:12,380
An American man, a Mexican boy.

435
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,310
You see what I mean?

436
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:16,742
Yeah.

437
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:18,692
Well, I'm not allowed to talk about destinations.

438
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:19,742
I can get in big trouble.

439
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:20,682
I don't know you.

440
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:26,171
Where you from?

441
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,012
What do you care?

442
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,181
What is a guy from New York doing

443
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:32,351
all the way out here, huh?

444
00:39:35,943 --> 00:39:39,288
If you must know, it's because New York is crazy now.

445
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:43,497
I used to have a place on West 4th Street for $400 a month.

446
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:45,541
You can't even get a place in Red Hook for that much anymore.

447
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:46,801
It's crazy.

448
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,131
The guppies took over.

449
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:49,120
It's...

450
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,439
You lived on West 4th by the cage?

451
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,270
Yeah.
Why?

452
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:52,970
You've been there?

453
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:55,329
I grew up on Minetta Lane.

454
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,459
Get the fuck outta...
get the fuck outta here.

455
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,909
-Yeah.
-No shit?

456
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:05,058
You know, that's where they shot the movie, "Serpico."

457
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:07,479
-My dad knew Serpico.
-Get the...

458
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:08,809
The real Serpico.

459
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,808
Yeah, he grew up on Perry and Greenwich.

460
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,489
Get the fuck outta here.

461
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:14,319
Get the fuck outta here.

462
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,309
Get outta here.

463
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,719
-Yeah, yeah.
-No shit.

464
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:19,177
Yeah.

465
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:21,467
Let me ask you something.

466
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:25,246
Did he really have one of them big dogs like in the movie?

467
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,129
Oh, yeah.

468
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,859
Right.

469
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,128
But I can't remember.

470
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:28,958
I was just a baby.

471
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,356
Because in a movie, Serpico's got one of them big dogs,

472
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:33,248
you know?

473
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:34,757
Like the kind in "Peter Pan" that goes flying

474
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:38,395
through the air with Wendy.

475
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:40,356
Uh... no, that's a flying Saint Bernard.

476
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,416
Saint Bernard.
Saint Bernard.

477
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:45,166
Yeah but Serpico's dog was one of them shaggy

478
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,196
dogs with the hair in the eyes.

479
00:40:47,198 --> 00:40:48,866
You telling me that's not a Saint Bernard?

480
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:49,577
I don't think so.

481
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,635
I think you might be wrong.
Yeah.

482
00:40:57,638 --> 00:40:59,106
I'll Google it.

483
00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:03,633
Yeah, I'm gonna Google that shit.

484
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:05,866
Look, I'd love to talk movies, and New York,

485
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:08,095
and dogs, and googolplex configurations all day long,

486
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:09,775
but we got to make a decision here, all right?

487
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:11,136
I'm not going to get you in any trouble.

488
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,444
I just want to know where this man and the little boy

489
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:14,436
are going.

490
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:18,515
You looking to hurt somebody, man?

491
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,355
No.
No, I'm trying to help somebody.

492
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:21,055
Here.

493
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:22,755
Take this money and telling me where they're going.

494
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:28,614
Santa Reyes.

495
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,694
It's through the hills and is down by the ocean,

496
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,334
but the only way to get there is to follow me.

497
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:33,035
And...

498
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:34,424
That's what I had in mind.

499
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,533
Everybody's going to see you.

500
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:36,804
I mean, everybody's going to see you.

501
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:38,943
You... you stick out like a broken nose.

502
00:41:38,945 --> 00:41:39,944
You make money at this shit?

503
00:41:39,945 --> 00:41:40,734
Yeah.

504
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:41,954
Oh, yeah?

505
00:41:41,955 --> 00:41:45,461
Well, this $500 bill says that I'm smashing.

506
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:46,872
-$500?
-Yeah.

507
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:50,002
Or is that against the rules, too?

508
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:50,874
I'm no cabbage head.

509
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,752
I know that cabs are expensive in LA.

510
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:55,552
You get this half, and I'll give you the other half

511
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:57,512
when we get to our destination.

512
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,374
Now, come on.

513
00:41:58,374 --> 00:42:00,691
Pop the trunk.
-What?

514
00:42:00,694 --> 00:42:01,653
What are you crazy?

515
00:42:01,654 --> 00:42:02,474
Come on.

516
00:42:02,475 --> 00:42:03,973
Trunk.

517
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:06,990
You're putting me in a very idiosyncratic spot here.

518
00:42:11,574 --> 00:42:12,643
I hope you can breathe in there.

519
00:42:12,644 --> 00:42:15,410
Oh, I had apartments smaller than this in New York.

520
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:16,311
I heard that.

521
00:43:44,628 --> 00:43:46,626
I'm open.

522
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:47,627
I'm open.

523
00:43:57,107 --> 00:44:00,174
Hey, here's the other half.

524
00:44:00,177 --> 00:44:02,734
Which way did they go?

525
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:05,244
Uh, I can't see anything.

526
00:44:05,236 --> 00:44:06,505
-Take your glasses off.
-Oh.

527
00:44:06,507 --> 00:44:07,206
Thank you.

528
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,802
Good doggy, OK?
OK.

529
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:39,772
Good.

530
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:41,742
You're good.
All right.

531
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,139
How you doing, my friend?

532
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,910
How's your stomach?

533
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,009
It hurts.

534
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,168
Can I offer you some coffee?

535
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,667
Delicious.

536
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,699
Sure.

537
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,216
In the meantime, if I may inquire,

538
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,237
what are you doing sneaking around in the dark

539
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:02,417
on private property?

540
00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:04,098
You upset my dog.

541
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,477
Are you with the FBI?

542
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,288
The FBI?

543
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:08,817
No.

544
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,298
I'm with myself.

545
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:13,406
I'm not after you or your dog.

546
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:16,096
So it's Harold?

547
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:17,017
Harold?

548
00:46:17,018 --> 00:46:18,117
Uh, yeah.
Right.

549
00:46:18,118 --> 00:46:18,817
Harold.

550
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:23,747
I'm just trying to figure out what Harold's doing...

551
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:25,287
He works for us.

552
00:46:25,278 --> 00:46:27,225
For the orphanage.

553
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:29,136
He goes out, and he finds children who are in trouble,

554
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:32,355
and he brings them here.

555
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:36,553
He's saved the lives of countless childrens.

556
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:39,215
Harold could be the only saint I've ever met.

557
00:46:39,217 --> 00:46:40,316
Saint?

558
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:43,544
That's correct, my friend.

559
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:45,676
So that's all?

560
00:46:45,668 --> 00:46:46,436
That's why you're here?

561
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:53,503
That's it.

562
00:46:53,507 --> 00:46:56,204
Would you like some sugar or some cream?

563
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:57,604
Uh, no.
No.

564
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,855
That's... thanks.

565
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:07,943
This is good, right?

566
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:08,715
Having coffee together?

567
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:14,742
Every day, good mood.
What can I say?

568
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:17,103
Oh, it's terrific today.

569
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:18,314
Oh?

570
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:19,913
It was great.

571
00:47:19,915 --> 00:47:21,743
Over at place called Punta Abreojos.

572
00:47:29,984 --> 00:47:33,101
Punto... I know what that means.

573
00:47:33,104 --> 00:47:35,042
What's Abreojos?

574
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:38,181
It means, open eyes.

575
00:47:38,184 --> 00:47:39,113
It means I can see you, man.

576
00:47:46,524 --> 00:47:48,881
Oh, man.

577
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:51,241
I like you, brother.

578
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:51,992
Well that's great.

579
00:47:51,993 --> 00:47:53,172
I like you, too.

580
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:55,860
I don't have any reason to but I just like you.

581
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:59,080
Sometimes, that's just the way it goes.

582
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:01,900
Sometimes you meet somebody,
and you don't like them.

583
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:04,190
That ever happen to you?
-Sometimes.

584
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:09,870
That's why I don't go out a lot, you know?

585
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:14,550
People... they can hurt you.

586
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:24,634
My wife... having some trouble with her, you know.

587
00:48:24,631 --> 00:48:28,168
So I stay by myself a lot of times.

588
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,120
It's OK.

589
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,099
Aw, man.

590
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,748
You're a nice guy.

591
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:37,939
I'm going to have to take your phone

592
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,209
and delete the photos in the gallery.

593
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,708
Oy.
That's...

594
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,108
You know, if I didn't like you, I'd take this phone

595
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,676
and I'd just smash it into the wall.

596
00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:58,116
I appreciate that you don't.

597
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:00,797
Man, that's a good shot of me.

598
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,859
Too bad.

599
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:06,437
I think so.

600
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:09,495
Our friend here was just leaving.

601
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,006
Take care, my friend.

602
00:49:18,008 --> 00:49:19,717
And please tell whoever is wondering about Harold

603
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,586
that he's doing fantastic.

604
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:23,396
He's a very virtuous man.

605
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:27,014
Do you know where that diner is out of town?

606
00:49:27,008 --> 00:49:29,865
The truck stop?

607
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:32,384
Let me talk to Coach Hewitt, please.

608
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,644
Hold on.

609
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:36,535
Drexler Hewitt.

610
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:38,575
His name is Harold.

611
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:40,316
He's not a pederast.

612
00:49:40,317 --> 00:49:43,643
Why am I finding out things that other people already know?

613
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,285
You have to give me more information

614
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:46,125
before I go any further.

615
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:47,325
Of course I will.

616
00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:49,344
And some more money, too.

617
00:49:49,346 --> 00:49:51,084
Where's Harold Fullmer now?

618
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:52,025
Harold Fullmer.

619
00:49:52,026 --> 00:49:53,594
Mm-hmm.
-That's his name.

620
00:49:53,596 --> 00:49:54,415
Yes.

621
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:56,084
Mm-hmm.

622
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,523
Well, why don't you tell me why
I'm following Harold Fullmer,

623
00:49:58,526 --> 00:50:00,603
and I'll tell you where I'm following him.

624
00:50:00,605 --> 00:50:01,535
OK, OK.

625
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:02,784
I have a counter offer, Mr. Rosow.

626
00:50:02,785 --> 00:50:06,432
Why don't you retrieve him
and deliver him to New York.

627
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:07,714
New York?

628
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:09,404
No.
No, thanks.

629
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:11,542
More money in it than you've ever earned.

630
00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:13,163
I don't do that sort of thing.

631
00:50:13,164 --> 00:50:18,319
How's $500,000 sound?

632
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:20,302
I can wire the money into your checking account

633
00:50:20,304 --> 00:50:21,972
when the subject is delivered.

634
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:22,913
Delivered to whom?

635
00:50:22,914 --> 00:50:23,843
His wife.

636
00:50:23,844 --> 00:50:25,073
She's my client.

637
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:25,973
She loves him.

638
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:26,723
She misses him.

639
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:28,053
She just wants to talk to him.

640
00:50:28,054 --> 00:50:32,229
She must want to talk to him real bad.

641
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,231
That's a lot of money.

642
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:36,421
He might turn tail and run again after a couple of words.

643
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:42,157
Well Mr. Rosow, that's not your problem.

644
00:50:42,163 --> 00:50:44,131
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

645
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:46,521
We thought that with your history

646
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:47,982
you'd comprehend the situation.

647
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:48,691
You could sympathize.

648
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,461
You would understand.

649
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:53,590
I don't understand anything.

650
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,981
OK, he's coming back now.

651
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:56,081
I get it.

652
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:57,471
What do you want me to say to him.

653
00:50:57,473 --> 00:50:59,041
Just say hello.

654
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,180
Hi, Rosow.

655
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:02,000
I just decided to stay in your motel room

656
00:51:02,002 --> 00:51:04,679
for 24 hours waiting for you
to come back to my loving arms.

657
00:51:04,672 --> 00:51:05,681
There you go.

658
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:06,382
All right.

659
00:51:06,382 --> 00:51:08,119
I convinced him that I was lonely and desperate.

660
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:10,738
I don't think even he believed
I was that lonely and desperate.

661
00:51:10,741 --> 00:51:12,000
Just pour him a drink.

662
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,197
Are these the kind of games you like to play?

663
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:27,697
No... well... it's not what you think.

664
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,858
Hey, I promise I got no idea at all.

665
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,967
I don't know what you're doing
or who you're working for.

666
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,738
I work for myself.

667
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:35,949
Who was on the phone?

668
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,517
But it's... ex-boyfriend.

669
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,517
How long have you been here?

670
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,177
You work for Harold?
Hewitt?

671
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,019
Don Edgar?

672
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,298
The Feds?

673
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:51,134
No, no, no, and no.

674
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:52,457
Ow.
You're hurting me.

675
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:53,159
Yeah.

676
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:55,836
Come on, Miss Lonely Hearts,
tell me something I don't know.

677
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:57,507
Huh?
-Papitos.

678
00:51:57,509 --> 00:51:58,578
Gus?

679
00:51:58,579 --> 00:51:59,877
Let me go.

680
00:51:59,878 --> 00:52:01,697
You work for Gus?

681
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:04,556
- Let me go.
-Pappy.

682
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,077
Oh, shit.

683
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:12,346
Care for a cocktail?

684
00:52:12,347 --> 00:52:14,445
I sure do.

685
00:52:14,438 --> 00:52:15,967
It's been a long night.

686
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:28,185
Oh, Gus.

687
00:52:37,076 --> 00:52:38,065
Ah!

688
00:52:38,066 --> 00:52:40,074
Ow.

689
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:42,564
Damn, that hurt.
Oh.

690
00:53:07,595 --> 00:53:11,900
All right, all right.
All right.

691
00:53:14,574 --> 00:53:15,833
Hello?

692
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:18,042
It's Hero Furillo.

693
00:53:18,044 --> 00:53:20,991
I just dropped off your guy at Union Station.

694
00:53:20,994 --> 00:53:21,693
You, uh, need a ride?

695
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:30,612
May I have your attention,

696
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:31,313
please?

697
00:53:31,313 --> 00:53:34,089
This is the first call for flight on Air South 572.

698
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:41,056
Services to San Diego, now boarding on Terminal D.

699
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:42,212
You saved my bacon.

700
00:53:45,962 --> 00:53:47,530
You better be doing the right thing here, man.

701
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:49,760
Yeah.

702
00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:51,521
I mean it.

703
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:52,991
You know, I'll probably never see you again,

704
00:53:52,992 --> 00:53:54,620
so it's not like I'll ever really know.

705
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:57,729
But you better be doing the right thing, Holmes.

706
00:53:57,732 --> 00:53:59,420
You know?

707
00:53:59,421 --> 00:54:01,829
I like to think that you're on the right side.

708
00:54:01,832 --> 00:54:03,379
Serpico's side.

709
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,278
'Cause that's the side I want to get on.

710
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:07,879
I wish it was that simple.

711
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:09,010
Oh, don't give me that, man.

712
00:54:09,011 --> 00:54:13,466
Come on, don't give me that.

713
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:15,009
I won't let you down, you know.

714
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,358
May I have your attention please?

715
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:44,822
K-9 passenger, David Dupree,
please report to

716
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:47,796
David Dupree, please report to

717
00:54:51,298 --> 00:54:53,166
Aren't you a little tired of trains?

718
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:57,047
Do I know you?

719
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:58,307
You recognize me, all right.

720
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,476
I've been following you.

721
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:01,776
But why?

722
00:55:01,777 --> 00:55:04,345
I'm getting paid.

723
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:05,736
Oh.

724
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:07,476
For the money.

725
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:10,205
Why's the FBI tailing you?

726
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:12,604
I don't know.

727
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:13,936
Well, I'll try
another question.

728
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:15,765
You ready to come back with me, Harold?

729
00:55:15,757 --> 00:55:17,475
Back to your wife?

730
00:55:17,477 --> 00:55:19,376
Absolutely no.

731
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:21,913
If you don't come with me, I'll cause a ruckus.

732
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:24,314
I'll scream that you robbed me or propositioned me.

733
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:25,495
I'll probably punch you.

734
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:27,325
The miso soup will go flying everywhere.

735
00:55:27,326 --> 00:55:29,004
The little waitress will call the police,

736
00:55:29,006 --> 00:55:30,604
and we'll both get arrested... which

737
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:34,202
is fine for me but not for you.

738
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,184
If I were you, I'd rather talk to my wife

739
00:55:36,176 --> 00:55:38,134
than the authorities.

740
00:55:38,136 --> 00:55:40,952
And you can start by talking to me.

741
00:55:47,566 --> 00:55:50,262
I find children that are in distress,

742
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:53,291
and I take them to a safe haven.

743
00:55:53,294 --> 00:55:56,271
Doesn't anybody miss these kids?

744
00:55:56,264 --> 00:56:00,110
The world is filled with children no one wants.

745
00:56:00,114 --> 00:56:04,110
This last kid in Chicago...
he seemed OK enough.

746
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:06,821
Javier?

747
00:56:06,814 --> 00:56:10,060
He was in 20 porno films before I found him,

748
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:12,850
and he tried to kill himself twice.

749
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:16,680
His mother had eight children, husband gone.

750
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:19,610
Someone offered her $1,000
to take Javier into America.

751
00:56:19,613 --> 00:56:22,800
Feed him, clothe him, enroll him in a good Catholic...

752
00:56:22,803 --> 00:56:24,022
Allright, all right, all right.
That's enough.

753
00:56:24,023 --> 00:56:24,832
We got a plane to catch.

754
00:56:24,823 --> 00:56:26,332
I can't fly.

755
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,102
What?

756
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:28,022
You heard me.

757
00:56:28,023 --> 00:56:29,930
No, we're not taking a train back to New York.

758
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:32,480
Those sleeping cars are like coffins.

759
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:33,612
New York?

760
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:34,941
Yeah.

761
00:56:34,932 --> 00:56:36,261
You're going back to her.

762
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:39,218
She's worried about you.

763
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:41,329
I don't like flying myself.

764
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,610
I'm not a big fan of New York neither.

765
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:43,311
Why?

766
00:56:43,311 --> 00:56:44,300
What happened in New York?

767
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:57,798
Sometimes when you try to make things better,

768
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,089
you end up just making them worse.

769
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,128
All that bullshit.

770
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,669
Harold, what about your wife, huh?

771
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:04,040
You don't just drop out.

772
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:06,718
The life I lead now is the very contrary to dropping out.

773
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,798
Most people can't wait to get home

774
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,247
to house, to their apartment.

775
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,048
Shut the door, and turn on the TV.

776
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,109
To me that's dropping out.

777
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,936
Nah.

778
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:25,474
I never felt myself as a civilian.

779
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,817
This kind of life, being missing... it suits me.

780
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,586
It all changes so fast.

781
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:37,037
One day, I was one person.

782
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:39,935
Then came the explosions,
and I was another person.

783
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:46,376
Some things are too terrible to be true.

784
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,725
Explosions?

785
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:53,487
Didn't they tell you?

786
00:57:53,488 --> 00:57:54,307
No, what?

787
00:57:54,307 --> 00:57:56,594
Tell me what.

788
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:59,604
I worked in the World Trade Center.

789
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:01,336
I barely made it out in time.

790
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:10,093
I ran down those steps out of the North Tower.

791
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:15,885
I haven't seen my wife since.

792
00:58:21,016 --> 00:58:22,544
You were a missing person?

793
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:24,475
I am a missing person.

794
00:58:29,855 --> 00:58:31,993
I thought of calling home and trying to tell her

795
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:32,695
I was all right.

796
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,153
I couldn't do it.

797
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:40,902
I didn't know why.

798
00:58:40,905 --> 00:58:42,693
The next day, it occurred to me that she

799
00:58:42,695 --> 00:58:43,954
probably thought I was dead.

800
00:58:46,884 --> 00:58:49,981
I was relieved.

801
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,733
She'd always think of me as a hero

802
00:58:51,735 --> 00:58:56,019
of sorts... a reluctant hero.

803
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:03,272
How the hell do you do that?

804
00:59:03,274 --> 00:59:05,520
How do you leave your wife like that?

805
00:59:10,454 --> 00:59:14,669
We lost a child, Megan and I.
A kidnapping.

806
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,050
It changed everything.

807
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:22,421
Nothing was right after that.

808
00:59:26,722 --> 00:59:29,779
Oh, I'm sorry.

809
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:38,123
That's terrible, but still... still.

810
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:36,167
Ladies and gentlemen,

811
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:37,546
if you'll look outside your window,

812
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:39,766
you'll see the lights of New York city coming up.

813
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:42,085
We're about a half hour outside of JFK.

814
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:43,286
The weather is beautiful.
It's a warm...

815
01:00:43,287 --> 01:00:44,266
Hey, baby.

816
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:45,256
What floor are you on?

817
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:46,985
We're on the 50th floor.

818
01:00:46,987 --> 01:00:47,687
50th floor?

819
01:00:47,688 --> 01:00:49,156
We have seven people here.

820
01:00:49,157 --> 01:00:50,136
We can't get out.

821
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:51,595
Babe, don't worry.

822
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:53,066
The guys are on the way there now.

823
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,165
They'll be running up there, too.

824
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,775
You're gonna see me before you know it.

825
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:58,285
OK?
OK, baby.

826
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,265
The Murry's on Broadway.

827
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:01,754
Murray's on Broadway.

828
01:01:01,756 --> 01:01:03,744
Stand clear!

829
01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:12,667
The tower's coming down!

830
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,664
Where are you, ?

831
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:16,144
The other tower just went down.

832
01:01:16,145 --> 01:01:18,743
Went down, taking towers down.

833
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:20,104
Another tower went down?

834
01:01:20,105 --> 01:01:21,593
Yes.
Which one?

835
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:25,072
Which tower went down?

836
01:01:50,893 --> 01:01:52,222
Does my wife know what I've been doing?

837
01:01:58,654 --> 01:02:00,301
How much is she paying you?

838
01:02:00,302 --> 01:02:04,688
Hey, do you have any idea what it's like to be

839
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,172
abandoned by somebody?

840
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:07,761
I have an idea what it's like.

841
01:02:07,763 --> 01:02:09,860
Hey, just shut the fuck up.

842
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:11,730
I'm tired of you.

843
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:15,489
Excuse me, may I have another Bloody Mary?

844
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:17,291
Sorry, we're on our descent.

845
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:19,329
You better make it a double.

846
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,070
The white zone

847
01:02:25,062 --> 01:02:27,120
is for the immediate loading and
unloading of passengers only.

848
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:27,821
No parking.

849
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:35,551
Charley.

850
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:38,168
I didn't know you'd be accompanying us.

851
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,149
Terrific.

852
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,488
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

853
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,419
Sorry to hear that.

854
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:46,428
The Seymour Hotel, midtown.

855
01:02:46,421 --> 01:02:48,198
That's not what the lady said, boss.

856
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:48,429
Why?

857
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:49,629
Are you going to listen to the lady,

858
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:50,989
or are you going to listen to me?

859
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:53,268
What are you up to?

860
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,268
You can not smoke in here, boss.

861
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,818
It was a long flight.

862
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,108
Give me a break, kit kat.

863
01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:00,247
I thought we were going straight to me wife.

864
01:03:00,249 --> 01:03:02,127
Why the Seymour?

865
01:03:02,129 --> 01:03:03,857
I have some business to take care of.

866
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:05,408
I want to make sure it goes right.

867
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,579
Sorry, boss.

868
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,547
You cannot smoke in here, boss.
-OK.

869
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,187
I'm glad you're here, Charley.

870
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:14,337
I could use your help.

871
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:17,864
Closing out the ninth inning
has never been my strong suit.

872
01:03:17,858 --> 01:03:20,226
I'm still trying to find your strong suit.

873
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:22,476
Oh, but I forgot you never played baseball.

874
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:24,457
If you insist on smoking, boss,

875
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:25,298
I will have to ask you...

876
01:03:25,298 --> 01:03:26,306
Oh, OK.

877
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:27,376
OK.

878
01:03:27,377 --> 01:03:29,715
Hey.

879
01:03:29,718 --> 01:03:30,897
Thank you, boss.

880
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:33,465
Oh, you are most welcome.

881
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:35,506
And please stop call me boss.

882
01:03:35,498 --> 01:03:38,295
I am not Bruce Springsteen.

883
01:03:38,297 --> 01:03:39,316
You can drive now.

884
01:03:47,617 --> 01:03:49,765
So is this your first time in New York, buddy?

885
01:04:49,743 --> 01:04:51,392
Who's there?
Boo.

886
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:52,263
Boo who?

887
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,212
Don't cry.

888
01:04:53,213 --> 01:04:54,820
It's just me.

889
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:58,199
Bam.

890
01:04:58,202 --> 01:04:59,111
Hey.

891
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:01,560
-Hey.
-John.

892
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,270
-They made you a lieutenant?
-I know.

893
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:04,810
Lieutenant Pappy?

894
01:05:05,722 --> 01:05:06,641
This is crazy.

895
01:05:06,642 --> 01:05:08,990
Yeah, it's crazy.

896
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,900
Do my eyes deceive me?

897
01:05:10,902 --> 01:05:11,881
Gus?

898
01:05:11,882 --> 01:05:12,951
Harold.

899
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:15,039
The homecoming gets larger.

900
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:16,430
How'd you know?

901
01:05:16,432 --> 01:05:18,290
A little birdie.

902
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,859
Lana sends her love.

903
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:21,929
-What love?
-I know.

904
01:05:21,931 --> 01:05:23,179
I owe you an explanation.

905
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,208
Give me a drink, will you?

906
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:30,829
I was responsible for you, John.

907
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:32,808
You were my recommendation,
so I had to send Lana down

908
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,059
to keep an eye.

909
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:37,177
I was hearing some weird stories about you.

910
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,384
I had to make sure you're still compos mentis, you block head.

911
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:46,448
God, it's good to see you.

912
01:05:49,209 --> 01:05:51,327
You're so serious.

913
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:52,447
Move along.

914
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,057
Shove off, sailor.

915
01:05:55,049 --> 01:05:57,187
Whos' Lana?

916
01:05:57,189 --> 01:05:59,257
-You weren't in on that?
-No.

917
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,627
Who is she?

918
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:02,427
This lady.

919
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:03,528
She dropped Gus' name.

920
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:08,174
I didn't see a connection so I did some ogling.

921
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:10,396
You found out that Gus worked on our case, the kidnapping.

922
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,377
I did.

923
01:06:11,377 --> 01:06:14,574
And then Gus called and volunteered to help

924
01:06:14,568 --> 01:06:15,667
out when we got to New York.

925
01:06:18,088 --> 01:06:19,357
It didn't work out the way we wanted,

926
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:21,954
but Gus was a good man throughout.

927
01:06:21,957 --> 01:06:24,724
I still have some bad nights about that, Harold.

928
01:06:24,717 --> 01:06:26,805
You know I do.

929
01:06:26,807 --> 01:06:28,456
I'm sorry it's going down like this,

930
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:33,922
but Miss Megan...
she's beside herself.

931
01:06:33,927 --> 01:06:35,895
And then she finds out you're still alive.

932
01:06:35,887 --> 01:06:37,805
I mean, you can imagine.

933
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:39,246
What are you doing here, Gus?

934
01:06:39,247 --> 01:06:42,033
I'm going to babysit you, Harold,

935
01:06:42,036 --> 01:06:45,513
while John and Miss Smiley over there

936
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:47,674
take care of some business.

937
01:06:47,676 --> 01:06:50,373
Who's side are you on?

938
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,803
Who's side am I on?

939
01:06:52,806 --> 01:06:55,143
I'm on your wife's side.

940
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:58,632
Don't you think she's been through enough?

941
01:06:58,636 --> 01:07:03,011
Besides, I got a soft spot for New Yorkers

942
01:07:03,015 --> 01:07:05,492
who stay in New York.

943
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,611
Hey, Miss Charley?

944
01:07:20,614 --> 01:07:23,401
-Yeah.
-Do me a favor?

945
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:47,817
Hello?

946
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:50,496
Mr. Rosow, I presume?

947
01:08:50,499 --> 01:08:51,278
Sit down, please.

948
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:12,416
I'm sorry about the darkness.

949
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:18,034
I'm afraid I've become quite a bit of a cave dweller

950
01:09:18,037 --> 01:09:19,176
over the past few years.

951
01:09:22,237 --> 01:09:23,426
Please don't do that in here.

952
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,345
I'm sorry.
-Why?

953
01:09:29,346 --> 01:09:32,333
It's all right.

954
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:33,675
It's a nasty habit.

955
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:34,386
I should quit.

956
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:39,054
I like your place.

957
01:09:39,056 --> 01:09:42,342
It's very nice.

958
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,274
Thank you.

959
01:09:44,276 --> 01:09:46,253
Can I get you anything?

960
01:09:46,245 --> 01:09:48,223
Some water, coffee?

961
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,364
Nah, it's all right.

962
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:53,261
I don't think your maid likes me very much.

963
01:09:53,265 --> 01:09:57,050
What makes you say that?

964
01:09:57,044 --> 01:09:58,853
Uh, I was just kidding, I guess.

965
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:03,353
I'm sorry.

966
01:10:03,354 --> 01:10:05,861
I'm not sure I got your joke.

967
01:10:05,854 --> 01:10:09,590
I've never had any dealings with private detectives, Mr. Rosow.

968
01:10:09,594 --> 01:10:12,102
I've seen them in Bogart films though.

969
01:10:12,104 --> 01:10:14,251
Was that one of those kind of jokes?

970
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:18,729
Those dry and sardonic detective jokes?

971
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:22,080
It was my sad attempt.

972
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:26,668
So you make jokes and smoke cigarettes.

973
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:32,527
Do those ancient customs make you more efficient, Detective?

974
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:33,621
Probably not.

975
01:10:33,622 --> 01:10:37,359
But I'm not really a Detective on this case anymore, am I?

976
01:10:37,352 --> 01:10:41,148
I'm more what you would call a delivery boy.

977
01:10:43,722 --> 01:10:47,498
Don't underestimate your value, Mr. Rosow.

978
01:10:47,492 --> 01:10:51,209
How did you find out Harold was alive?

979
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:55,087
A friend ran into him in Mexico.

980
01:10:55,081 --> 01:10:59,157
Of all places, some small village on the west coast

981
01:10:59,161 --> 01:11:00,490
Mexico.

982
01:11:00,492 --> 01:11:02,250
Impossible, I thought.

983
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:03,059
She was certain.

984
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:06,307
She swore it was Harold, despite the fact

985
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,608
that the medical examiner just ruled him.

986
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:14,889
Where is he?

987
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,028
Where is my husband?

988
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,429
He's close by.

989
01:11:18,431 --> 01:11:19,370
He's OK.

990
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:21,359
But uh, I gotta tell you...

991
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,527
Why is he not here with you?

992
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:26,357
That was the agreement.

993
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:29,386
It's about the money.

994
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:31,168
We can arrange for more.

995
01:11:31,169 --> 01:11:34,036
I-I-I don't want more money.

996
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:36,566
I want what I'm owed up front.
Now.

997
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:37,259
Beforehand.

998
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:41,576
Paid on delivery is what I understood.

999
01:11:46,138 --> 01:11:52,611
Um, Mrs. Fullmer, Harold's not the same man.

1000
01:11:52,618 --> 01:11:54,126
He's different, you know?

1001
01:11:54,127 --> 01:11:55,716
I mean, I didn't know him before...

1002
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:57,127
Everything is different.

1003
01:11:57,128 --> 01:11:59,445
Of course Harold is different.

1004
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,295
I just want to make sure he's OK.

1005
01:12:02,297 --> 01:12:07,831
And I know when he sees me, he'll remember...

1006
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:08,637
he'll remember himself.

1007
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:12,896
So I'll write you a check.

1008
01:12:12,897 --> 01:12:15,744
I-I-I understand you.

1009
01:12:15,737 --> 01:12:16,776
I really do.

1010
01:12:16,777 --> 01:12:19,434
But uh, sometimes when you try and make things better...

1011
01:12:19,437 --> 01:12:24,681
I know you do understand,
because they told me about you.

1012
01:12:24,676 --> 01:12:26,475
Oh.

1013
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:29,444
About your wife.

1014
01:12:29,447 --> 01:12:32,513
They told me about her.

1015
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:37,691
And... Mr. Rosow, I'm very sorry for your loss.

1016
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:42,834
Yeah.

1017
01:12:42,835 --> 01:12:45,782
Um, thanks.

1018
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:47,803
I, uh...

1019
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:51,111
Sorry.

1020
01:12:51,114 --> 01:12:53,022
No.

1021
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:56,471
Uh, thanks.

1022
01:12:56,465 --> 01:13:00,620
Whatever my chances are, I need to take them.

1023
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:11,650
Uh, could you make the check out to cash?

1024
01:13:15,634 --> 01:13:17,811
I'll deliver Harold tomorrow morning

1025
01:13:17,813 --> 01:13:18,921
after this check clears.

1026
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:23,361
Yes.

1027
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:28,317
And tell him one thing for me, Mr. Rosow.

1028
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:29,950
Will you?
- Sure.

1029
01:13:36,602 --> 01:13:39,109
Tell him, I can't wait to be with him.

1030
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:49,869
Bad news.

1031
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:51,549
Want a hit?

1032
01:13:51,551 --> 01:13:54,039
Yeah.

1033
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:59,085
Well, that kid blocks

1034
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,509
a play like Thurman Munson.

1035
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,197
I drank too much.
Harold's gone.

1036
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,007
Well, you'd think I'd drink too much.

1037
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:18,474
Too much to bring this guy back to his wife.

1038
01:14:18,469 --> 01:14:19,928
You were banking on that.

1039
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:22,197
Lana almost pulled it off.

1040
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:26,793
You always did like your conspiracy theories, John.

1041
01:14:26,788 --> 01:14:28,747
Sure you don't want a pop.

1042
01:14:28,749 --> 01:14:29,648
Oh, no.

1043
01:14:32,789 --> 01:14:35,456
You have a couple of scallion pancakes still?

1044
01:14:35,449 --> 01:14:38,665
Knock yourself out.

1045
01:14:38,668 --> 01:14:41,196
Don't forget the sauce.
-Yup.

1046
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:46,866
Yum.

1047
01:14:49,678 --> 01:14:52,455
I do miss the takeout Chinese.

1048
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:55,854
There's no place good in Chicago that delivers.

1049
01:14:55,847 --> 01:14:57,985
I could have told you that, and I've

1050
01:14:57,987 --> 01:15:00,454
never even been in Chicago.

1051
01:15:00,457 --> 01:15:02,026
What about the pizza?

1052
01:15:02,027 --> 01:15:03,955
They got that Chicago style, right?

1053
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:04,666
Yeah.

1054
01:15:04,657 --> 01:15:06,704
They got the Chicago style pizza, sure.

1055
01:15:06,706 --> 01:15:08,265
But you know what that is?

1056
01:15:08,266 --> 01:15:11,213
And I just found this out myself.

1057
01:15:11,216 --> 01:15:14,503
It's just Sicilian style.

1058
01:15:14,497 --> 01:15:18,442
It's just a different name for Sicilian.

1059
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:20,824
We went out to Di Fara's the other night.

1060
01:15:20,826 --> 01:15:22,794
We got seven pies.

1061
01:15:22,796 --> 01:15:25,303
I think he's still making them.

1062
01:15:25,295 --> 01:15:27,393
The boys miss you, John.

1063
01:15:27,396 --> 01:15:28,664
We all miss you.

1064
01:15:31,345 --> 01:15:34,312
How long have you been on Drexler Hewitt's payroll?

1065
01:15:34,315 --> 01:15:36,462
Here we go.

1066
01:15:36,455 --> 01:15:40,551
You get paid by Mrs. Fullmer to find Harold,

1067
01:15:40,555 --> 01:15:44,022
but you get paid even more
by Hewitt not to find Harold.

1068
01:15:44,025 --> 01:15:44,743
Is that it?

1069
01:15:44,734 --> 01:15:49,210
So you hire me to bring him back to Mrs. Fullmer.

1070
01:15:49,214 --> 01:15:51,072
But you hire me more for Drexler,

1071
01:15:51,074 --> 01:15:55,738
because you figure I'll muck it up.

1072
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:56,922
You got a napkin?

1073
01:16:00,243 --> 01:16:01,242
I earn my money.

1074
01:16:05,383 --> 01:16:09,329
You get the medics to forge Harold's death certificate...

1075
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:11,370
With Harold officially dead, case closed.

1076
01:16:11,373 --> 01:16:13,391
All the insurance and compensation money

1077
01:16:13,393 --> 01:16:16,879
gets collected, and the estate gets divvied up,

1078
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:20,419
and Drexler Hewitt gets his piece of the Fullmer pie.

1079
01:16:20,423 --> 01:16:22,910
I'm sure you got your crumb.

1080
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:26,028
But then... ooh.

1081
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:30,477
A friend of the Mrs. sees Harold in Mexico.

1082
01:16:30,482 --> 01:16:32,300
Harold wasn't coming back.

1083
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:33,949
He's gone.

1084
01:16:33,951 --> 01:16:36,498
He might as well have been dead.

1085
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:39,359
It's high time she figured that out for herself.

1086
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:42,259
Why do you care?

1087
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:46,236
9/11 families were paid by the government

1088
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:48,348
according to how much the victim would

1089
01:16:48,351 --> 01:16:51,338
have earned in a lifetime.

1090
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,637
I know.

1091
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,867
And Harold was a big deal broker.

1092
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,218
That's a lot of money.

1093
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:02,066
Enough for a greedy lawyer to want to make sure

1094
01:17:02,069 --> 01:17:04,996
he stays dead.

1095
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:09,105
So Drexler bought you to help him.

1096
01:17:09,109 --> 01:17:12,055
He knew how much Mrs. Fullmer trusted you.

1097
01:17:15,629 --> 01:17:22,132
Listen John, Harold wasn't going to stay home.

1098
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,426
He's nuts.

1099
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:27,805
His old lady's a kook-job.

1100
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:31,164
All that money for what?

1101
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:34,964
It's crazy, people like that.

1102
01:17:37,888 --> 01:17:38,937
They're not like us.

1103
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:46,475
She just wanted to talk to him, Gus.

1104
01:17:59,286 --> 01:18:00,884
I'm going to need you to leave your cell phone.

1105
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:05,414
You got all those nice pictures on it.

1106
01:18:10,735 --> 01:18:12,264
Oh, well.

1107
01:18:12,265 --> 01:18:14,273
I have a feeling it was going to get old anyway.

1108
01:18:20,885 --> 01:18:24,052
Oh John, one more thing.

1109
01:18:24,055 --> 01:18:26,512
Your old buddy, Don Edgar, taking

1110
01:18:26,505 --> 01:18:28,134
care of all the little kiddie-widdies

1111
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:30,511
down in Mexico way.

1112
01:18:30,514 --> 01:18:31,424
What about him?

1113
01:18:31,425 --> 01:18:33,652
That orphanage is a front.

1114
01:18:33,654 --> 01:18:37,990
Don Edgar, the most major
dope dealer in Tijuana.

1115
01:18:37,984 --> 01:18:40,001
Yeah, that's right.

1116
01:18:40,003 --> 01:18:42,131
Whether Harold knew it
or not, he was in cahoots

1117
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:44,261
with a very bad hombre.

1118
01:18:44,263 --> 01:18:45,842
I don't believe you.

1119
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:47,792
No?

1120
01:18:47,794 --> 01:18:49,851
It's true.

1121
01:18:49,853 --> 01:18:54,029
Why you think the FBI was snooping around?

1122
01:18:54,033 --> 01:18:55,601
Christ.

1123
01:18:55,593 --> 01:18:58,241
What happened to those kids?

1124
01:18:58,243 --> 01:19:00,280
Don Edgar says he sends them back to their families.

1125
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:04,421
Right.

1126
01:19:04,413 --> 01:19:05,402
And I'm Tinkerbell.

1127
01:19:09,932 --> 01:19:13,159
You seem upset, John.

1128
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:15,170
What are you thinking?

1129
01:19:15,162 --> 01:19:19,756
You thinking you want to come over here and hit me?

1130
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:22,019
No.

1131
01:19:22,021 --> 01:19:25,098
I'm just trying to remember what I ever saw in you.

1132
01:21:33,724 --> 01:21:35,262
He give you any trouble?

1133
01:21:35,253 --> 01:21:36,961
-No.
-He was very nice.

1134
01:21:36,963 --> 01:21:38,042
No trouble at all.

1135
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:39,652
Hey, put your hands on the table.

1136
01:21:39,654 --> 01:21:42,351
Now.

1137
01:21:42,354 --> 01:21:44,151
He plays like an angel, doesn't he?

1138
01:21:48,953 --> 01:21:53,338
Tomorrow morning, you go back to her.

1139
01:21:53,343 --> 01:21:54,761
The gig is up.

1140
01:21:54,752 --> 01:21:57,290
This is the old reality, Harold.

1141
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:01,168
You're in New York, you ain't dead,
there aren't any angels,

1142
01:22:01,172 --> 01:22:03,958
and the Mrs. wants to see you.

1143
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:08,707
A matter of fact, she says,
she can't wait to see you.

1144
01:22:08,702 --> 01:22:10,900
You know about angels, Rosow?

1145
01:22:10,902 --> 01:22:12,949
Oh, I do?

1146
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:15,728
I saw you listening to the song.

1147
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:18,079
Did you see him, Miss Charley?

1148
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:20,738
-No, I did not.
-Yeah.

1149
01:22:20,741 --> 01:22:23,488
The music is OK, but the service stinks.

1150
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:25,339
We're empty here.
Where's the waitress?

1151
01:22:57,019 --> 01:22:57,718
Good morning.

1152
01:23:19,048 --> 01:23:21,025
Hey, what the fuck are you doing, you idiot?

1153
01:23:41,846 --> 01:23:44,353
Who's the saint who looks after money?

1154
01:23:44,346 --> 01:23:45,835
I can't hear you.

1155
01:23:45,836 --> 01:23:48,793
Then never mind.

1156
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:51,552
You got a problem with me smoking?

1157
01:23:51,555 --> 01:23:52,255
No.

1158
01:23:55,506 --> 01:23:56,205
Come on.

1159
01:24:13,004 --> 01:24:15,122
I appreciate this, Charlie.

1160
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:15,873
Oh, that's OK.

1161
01:24:15,874 --> 01:24:17,263
No.

1162
01:24:17,264 --> 01:24:19,930
I really do.

1163
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:22,851
You want me to go up with you?

1164
01:24:22,854 --> 01:24:25,251
-I think I should go alone.
-OK.

1165
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:28,091
Well, I've some business with Drexler Hewitt, so...

1166
01:24:28,094 --> 01:24:28,792
Good luck.

1167
01:24:28,793 --> 01:24:29,782
Good luck.

1168
01:24:46,643 --> 01:24:48,440
Memories flooding you right about now?

1169
01:24:48,442 --> 01:24:49,321
Hmm?

1170
01:24:49,322 --> 01:24:50,491
No, not really.

1171
01:24:50,492 --> 01:24:51,541
Hey, listen to me.

1172
01:24:51,542 --> 01:24:53,870
There's no way you're going in with this kind of attitude, OK?

1173
01:24:53,872 --> 01:24:55,211
You stand up straight.

1174
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:56,211
You look happy to see her.

1175
01:24:56,212 --> 01:24:57,121
Come on.

1176
01:25:00,332 --> 01:25:01,111
Remember me, darling?

1177
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:07,061
Is that you, sir?

1178
01:25:11,901 --> 01:25:14,049
Don't be rude to the lady.

1179
01:25:14,051 --> 01:25:15,219
I need to use the bathroom.

1180
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,328
Hey.
This is... what?

1181
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,547
One of them recreations of the famous painting?

1182
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:31,529
Huh?

1183
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:34,497
Kind of funky looking, isn't it?

1184
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:38,215
Julian, Mr. and Mrs. Fullmer's son.

1185
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:40,227
He won the contest at school with that piece.

1186
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:41,348
Huh.

1187
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:45,046
The theme was masterpieces of American Art.

1188
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,085
Julian was only 8 years old when he painted it.

1189
01:25:48,088 --> 01:25:48,787
Hm.

1190
01:25:52,068 --> 01:25:53,687
Pretty good for an 8-year-old, I guess.

1191
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:54,578
Don't touch it.

1192
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:29,426
John?

1193
01:26:40,175 --> 01:26:40,875
John?

1194
01:26:48,345 --> 01:26:49,834
Let me go, please.

1195
01:26:54,664 --> 01:26:55,773
Please let me go.

1196
01:27:57,521 --> 01:28:02,665
You wake up one day and you're an adult.

1197
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:05,827
And all the people you were just dreaming about

1198
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,209
have gone and changed.

1199
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,197
So you shake the sleep dust from your eyes

1200
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:17,224
and you say, was it really so long ago that you

1201
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:20,776
and I sat together in fun?

1202
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,607
No.

1203
01:28:22,609 --> 01:28:25,327
Not so long ago.

1204
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,777
But life goes by in the blink of an eye.

1205
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:33,366
Sobriety after all this time isn't as bitter

1206
01:28:33,369 --> 01:28:37,026
as I thought it would be.

1207
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:40,425
Recently, for a second or two, I almost felt like things

1208
01:28:40,429 --> 01:28:41,597
were OK with the world.

1209
01:28:44,298 --> 01:28:46,905
Strange to feel that way when you know there are

1210
01:28:46,898 --> 01:28:49,526
wars everywhere, and everything's

1211
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:52,555
going to hell in a hand basket.

1212
01:28:52,558 --> 01:28:56,304
But still I must admit, for a moment

1213
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:57,946
I felt some kind of peace.

1214
01:29:03,226 --> 01:29:04,795
Charley.

1215
01:29:04,787 --> 01:29:08,653
She finally said yes
to a date with me.

1216
01:29:08,657 --> 01:29:10,834
I have a confession.
I lied.

1217
01:29:13,407 --> 01:29:16,314
You were right.

1218
01:29:16,307 --> 01:29:20,492
I have four older brothers,
and I was an all-star shortstop

1219
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:22,724
in the boys' Little League three years in a row

1220
01:29:22,726 --> 01:29:24,884
until they kicked me out.

1221
01:29:41,415 --> 01:29:43,943
You remember when it was like that?

1222
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,283
When we were all together?

1223
01:29:47,865 --> 01:29:51,850
And I figured, we'd play forever.

1224
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:52,763
I had no idea.

1225
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:03,219
She's not a half-bad girl, Charley.

1226
01:30:03,223 --> 01:30:05,831
She's looking for a job now.

1227
01:30:05,824 --> 01:30:08,800
I told her, she could be my secretary once I

1228
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:11,520
got a few more assignments.

1229
01:30:11,523 --> 01:30:15,539
But she said, she didn't mix business with pleasure.

1230
01:30:15,533 --> 01:30:18,360
I promised her I was no pleasure.

1231
01:30:18,363 --> 01:30:21,630
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

1232
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:26,388
Sometimes, I think back to that day at Mrs. Fullmer's place.

1233
01:30:26,383 --> 01:30:30,288
And I ask myself, did you do the right thing?

1234
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:32,539
I don't know.

1235
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:34,270
What is that, the right thing?

1236
01:30:37,502 --> 01:30:39,310
A police reporter one said, that when

1237
01:30:39,312 --> 01:30:42,838
we pass beyond the lights of a precinct station,

1238
01:30:42,841 --> 01:30:44,779
we go into another world.

1239
01:30:44,771 --> 01:30:46,600
A place beyond right and wrong.

1240
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:53,217
I don't really mind living this way.

1241
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:56,018
Quiet, not much to say.

1242
01:30:56,011 --> 01:31:01,894
But sometimes, every once in awhile,

1243
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:04,158
I remember back to when I had you.
