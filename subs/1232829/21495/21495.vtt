00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,675
- Previously on Pure Genius...
- Welcome to Bunker Hill,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,424
where we are changing the world

3
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:06,168
one patient at a time.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,770
Julianna Wallace,

5
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:10,498
Executive Consumer Safety
Officer for the FDA.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,335
I wish you'd mentioned
that the grim reaper

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,759
was coming here to ruin our GSS trial.

8
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,457
Don't call her the grim reaper.

9
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,457
I need more data from the animal models

10
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:19,098
for approval of a human trial.

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,966
The study wasn't approved.

12
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,057
- James.
- Not now, W.

13
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,837
Well, when you do have a minute...

14
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:25,838
Damn it.

15
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:28,841
So, how's the Malik sitch?

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,176
Malik's, uh, a good guy.

17
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,165
And, uh, I moved on, so...

18
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,748
You're gonna find someone

19
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,369
really special, James.

20
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:39,345
- Keep your heart open, okay?
- Okay.

21
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,130
I can't believe we over-snoozed.

22
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:49,633
Waze says 14 minutes.

23
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,817
We'll be fine.
Pretty sure that's my shirt.

24
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,903
Yes, it is. There you go.

25
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:01,576
- Is that my phone or yours?
- It's yours.

26
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:04,012
It's a text from James. Who's Angelica?

27
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:05,681
Angelica?

28
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,253
Oh. Angeleeca.

29
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:12,888
Who's Angeleeca?

30
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,556
It's this amazing breakfast taco place

31
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:16,091
we found when we pulled an all-nighter

32
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:18,432
on the obesity case. It's like insane.

33
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:19,928
You want me to have him pick
something up for you?

34
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,929
Nah. I'm okay.

35
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:22,697
You sure?

36
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:25,067
Homemade flour tortillas,

37
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,003
eggs, chorizo,

38
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,205
melted Monterey Jack cheese.

39
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:32,674
Are you really trying to seduce me

40
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,276
with taco talk right now?

41
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,378
Maybe. Is it working?

42
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,247
Mmm. Damn right... but

43
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,316
we got to go.

44
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,389
Any time I rub up against something

45
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,924
these painful blisters open up.

46
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:51,927
This morphine pump follows me
around everywhere I go,

47
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,495
like it's the family pet.

48
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,630
So you think there's a way
to keep it from spreading?

49
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:58,133
Do you think the ECP
treatment will work?

50
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,702
- We believe it will.
- How long does something

51
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,904
- like that take to work?
- You'll need to do a cycle

52
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,806
every four weeks, and we
anticipate that it'll be

53
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,141
at least four to six months

54
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,009
before we see any marked improvement.

55
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,478
But we will cure her.

56
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,347
Wow. This is...

57
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,949
We can't thank you enough.

58
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:16,284
I'm super grateful.

59
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:19,121
This is the best news
I could have hoped for.

60
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,756
But four to six months...

61
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,658
I guess that means no prom.

62
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,527
Honey.

63
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:30,098
Lydia's senior prom is this weekend.

64
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,167
She had to drop out of school
when she was diagnosed.

65
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,235
She misses her friends.

66
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,137
I'm so sorry.

67
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,538
I blew mine off.

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,106
We don't even have prom in India.

69
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:40,175
Okay, so we'll get started.

70
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:42,477
Dr. Brockett and I have
another patient to see to.

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,712
- We do?
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:46,381
Oh, right. Angeleeca.

73
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,153
Mm. Really delicious.

74
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:53,255
That is really good.

75
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:01,363
Malik, we're needed in the ER.

76
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,497
Yes, sir.

77
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,000
Can I ask you a question?

78
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,102
Do you and James have
any private things,

79
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,637
just between the two of you?

80
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,505
Uh, just square dancing
every Friday night,

81
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,188
and our glee club.

82
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,343
No, we don't have any private things.

83
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:17,846
He and Zoe have this thing
with breakfast tacos.

84
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:19,912
Like their own special place.

85
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:22,751
I think it's more innocent
than that, Malik,

86
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,186
Yeah, I know.

87
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,421
I honestly have no idea
why it's bugging me.

88
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:28,623
You know what? It's not.

89
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,226
Get off me! I didn't do anything!

90
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,264
Officer, what's going on?

91
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,799
We need clearance to take
this man to the station.

92
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,234
Get out of here! Leave me alone!

93
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,735
A couple of businesses
called to complain

94
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,237
about a homeless drunk
wandering around the area

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,705
the last few days.

96
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:46,241
He was disturbing people,
he was agitated.

97
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,542
His breath reeks of whiskey.

98
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,211
I got to get out of here. Where am I?

99
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:50,345
You're in a hospital, Mister...

100
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:52,113
He doesn't know his name.

101
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,182
He doesn't have I.D.
He was sweating a lot.

102
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:55,584
His face was red, and, uh,

103
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:56,618
we decided just to bring him in

104
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,986
and get him checked out first.

105
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,487
You do a breathalyzer on him?

106
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,956
Didn't have to. You smell his breath.

107
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,529
- Blood alcohol zero.
- Seriously?

108
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,632
Blood-sugar level is high. 570.

109
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,801
That fruity smell on his breath,
it's not alcohol, it's ketones.

110
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:13,868
They're produced when there's not

111
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,737
enough insulin in your blood.

112
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:16,938
What is that?

113
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,040
It's a Thomas the Tank Engine tattoo.

114
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,076
I used to read those books to Luke.

115
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,244
I-I think this guy's got kids.

116
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:23,979
Officer, you need to uncuff him.

117
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,947
He's not drunk, and I doubt
he's homeless... he's sick.

118
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,849
- He needs to be admitted.
- We're gonna take care of you.

119
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,533
- Okay?
- If there's anyone in the area

120
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,485
looking for a missing person

121
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,621
matching his description,
send them to Bunker Hill.

122
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,256
Sir?

123
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:36,091
Tell me your name, sir.

124
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,915
Afternoon, Nina. Louis.

125
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,473
Up for a game of chess?
I'm feeling lucky.

126
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,309
I think Louis

127
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,180
maybe just needs to rest today.

128
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,029
Uh...

129
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,898
I knew he was getting worse,

130
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,199
but how long has he been like this?

131
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,769
His symptoms progressed
rapidly overnight.

132
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,505
The dysarthria is making it
difficult for him to speak.

133
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:26,254
He's having difficulty
eating and swallowing.

134
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:29,044
Soon, he may need
a nasal gastric feeding tube.

135
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:31,313
He doesn't have much longer, James.

136
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:36,586
Okay.

137
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,528
W.

138
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,196
I need your advice.

139
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,298
Yes, James?

140
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,834
Louis Keating isn't doing well.

141
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,269
Yes, I heard.

142
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,670
- I'm so sorry.
- And I've...

143
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:58,973
Mm-hmm. I've looked
into every possible solution,

144
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,642
and the only recourse, the only thing

145
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:04,045
that could possibly
save him is the PAI-120B

146
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,280
We're not approved to use that.

147
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,182
The FDA ruled against it.

148
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:09,317
My wife personally handled the decision.

149
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,819
Is there any way
that you could talk to her?

150
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:14,389
Just ask her one more time, please?

151
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:18,015
W... he's not gonna make it.

152
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,163
James, I know how hard this is,
how personal it is for you.

153
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,998
I will ask,

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,734
but I'm certain they won't
reverse their decision.

155
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,402
But you'll ask?

156
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:30,305
I'll ask.

157

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

158
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,693
- What are you doing?
- Try to calm down, sir.

159
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:43,777
We're just giving you some more saline.

160
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,879
- Get me out of here.
- I'm sorry I had to restrain you,

161
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,347
but you kept pulling out your IV.

162
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,783
You'll feel better soon.

163
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,385
Something's not right.

164
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:53,287
His blood-sugar levels are coming down,

165
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,719
and his heart rate and blood
pressure are normalizing.

166
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,675
His confusion should have
cleared up by now.

167
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,595
Yeah.

168
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,328
Dr. Wallace, the police
directed his family here.

169
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,455
Nathan!

170
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:03,764
Oh, my God.

171
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,252
Daddy?

172
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:06,300
You know this man? Yeah.

173
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,935
He's my husband.

174
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,791
Hey, Nathan.

175
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:12,506
We're here.

176
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,274
Who are you?

177
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:20,113
Earlier this week,
he was totally normal.

178
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,716
Then two day's ago,
Bobby's preschool called me.

179
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,017
Nathan never showed to pick him up,

180
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,586
and he wasn't answering his phone.

181
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:27,888
I was on a business trip in Arizona,

182
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,623
and I flew back right away.

183
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,092
What's happening to him?

184
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:34,261
We believe his diabetes
got out of control,

185
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:35,729
and he couldn't adjust his blood sugar,

186
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,922
which made him confused and combative.

187
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:41,494
I don't understand.
What do you mean, “diabetes”?

188
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,052
Nathan's not diabetic.

189
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,088
Are you sure?

190
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,922
Yes.

191
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,691
Has he taken any new medications?

192
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,994
No, nothing. He's been healthy.

193
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,529
How could this happen,
just out of nowhere...?

194
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:55,565
What's wrong with Daddy's eye?

195
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:56,733
Dr. Wallace.

196
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,739
Nathan?

197
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,140
Nathan, can you look
straight ahead at me, please?

198
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:05,842
- Get me out of here!
- What's going on?

199
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:08,311
The muscle responsible for
his eye movement is paralyzed.

200
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,381
His oxygen saturation level is dropping.

201
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:12,849
His diaphragm's weakening.

202
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,217
- Paralysis is spreading.
- Doctor?

203
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,252
Daddy?

204
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,356
I need a BiPAP machine
in here right now!

205
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:21,494
- Yes, Doctor.
- Okay, we're gonna have

206
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,092
to ask you to leave. Please. He's okay.

207
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:25,242
He's in good hands, trust me.

208
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:27,764
Don't sweat it, Lydia.

209
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:30,300
I'll take tons of pictures and

210
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,801
I'll come visit you on Monday.

211
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,803
We'll have a Nick Cage marathon.

212
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,205
I thought the point was
to make me feel better?

213
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,607
Oh...

214
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,111
Uh, hey, I got to run.

215
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:43,279
Doc's here.

216
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,914
Okay. See ya.

217
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,691
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

218
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:51,053
Okay, you're all done with the infusion.

219
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:53,960
We'll just have to
monitor you overnight.

220
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,461
Was that your boyfriend?

221
00:08:58,463 --> 00:08:59,562
No.

222
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:01,264
Pete's just a friend.

223
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,167
He asked me to go to the
prom a few months ago,

224
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,010
before my EB came on.

225
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:09,072
I called to tell him that I'm
not going to be able to make it.

226
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,307
Well, I'm sure he understands.

227
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,275
He's your friend, right?

228
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:13,857
Yep.

229
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:17,580
But you want him to be more than that?

230
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,849
Pretty sure that's not gonna happen.

231
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,998
Why do you say that?

232
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:23,686
Well, he's never really
seen me in that way.

233
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,822
Pete could have asked anyone to prom.

234
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,173
But he chose you.

235
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,726
Don't give up on him.

236
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,662
He'll probably ask somebody else now.

237
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:36,432
I just had this image in my head

238
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:41,243
of strutting into prom
wearing my kick-ass dress.

239
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,841
My hair and makeup on point and...

240
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:48,832
...and Pete would see me
in this whole new light.

241
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:53,561
It's so stupid.

242
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:58,845
I don't think that's stupid at all.

243
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:09,065
Nathan's MRI shows white spots

244
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,533
in the areas of the brain

245
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,568
that control eye movement
and respiration.

246
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,438
This inflammation is
causing his paralysis.

247
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,453
What is the commonality here?
What would explain

248
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,392
the eye deviation,
confusion and high blood sugar?

249
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:21,811
His spinal fluid did show
the presence of lymphocytes.

250
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:23,980
So we know his immune system's
reacting to something.

251
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,914
Bacterial cultures on
the spinal fluid were negative.

252
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,383
Yeah, but the lymphocytes are more

253
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:28,500
indicative of a viral infection.

254
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,353
Well, I ran a virus panel
on all the usual suspects,

255
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,779
but so far, nothing's shown up.

256
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,856
So if it is a viral infection,

257
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,192
we don't know what's causing it.

258
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:38,497
The fact that it's affecting
multiple organ systems

259
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:39,595
concerns me.

260
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,931
This could get worse very quickly.

261
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,699
Maybe we go back to basics.

262
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:44,934
When I was a programmer
and I had a virus

263
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,202
in one of my codes, I'd go line

264
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:47,703
by line to try to pinpoint the problem.

265
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,505
What if we do that with Nathan?

266
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:51,874
Study each strand of DNA piece by piece.

267
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,877
You're talking about
sequencing the human genome.

268
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,612
That can only be done at the CDC.

269
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,681
Not anymore. We have a DNA
sequencing machine right here.

270
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,850
We can do all this in-house.

271
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:03,052
Certain types of viruses
can integrate themselves

272
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:05,354
- into our DNA.
- Once you locate

273
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:06,789
the problematic strand,
the one that doesn't belong,

274
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,624
you can identify what's making him sick.

275
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,960
But isn't that like looking
for a needle in a haystack?

276
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,695
Doesn't it take an entire day
for current

277
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,964
DNA sequencing machines
to run their algorithm?

278
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,265
We've been developing new algorithms

279
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:17,800
that should cut the time in half.

280
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,268
Maybe.

281
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,404
Hey, it's worth a shot.

282
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:23,739
Right now,
it's the best option we've got.

283
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:30,580
- Broccoli?
- More specifically,

284
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,081
sulforaphane.

285
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,750
It's a naturally occurring
compound found in broccoli.

286
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,053
It's shown great promise in
studies on lab mice to quickly

287
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:39,722
heal blisters and improve
the integrity of the skin.

288
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,924
This process allows us
to take broccoli and extract

289
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,426
sulforaphane from it through solid-phase

290
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:44,727
extraction distillation.

291
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:46,929
Like taking vitamin C out of an orange.

292
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:49,332
We already have a good plan for Lydia.

293
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,298
Yes, but that plan
won't get her to prom.

294
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,935
How about we use virtual reality?

295
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,167
I can get her in the gym using VR.

296
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,471
Such a male idea of prom.

297
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,606
You cannot virtually go to prom.

298
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,241
- Mm-hmm.
- You have to physically be there.

299
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,575
School dances are evil events

300
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,110
that make 99% of the students miserable

301
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:03,045
so that the one percent
can have a magical night.

302
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,066
Guessing you didn't have a
good senior prom.

303
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,621
Fantastic. Stayed home, ordered pizza,
and watched Star Wars.

304
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:10,686
I think that we need
to let go of this prom idea.

305
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,089
This broccoli test, it worked in mice.

306
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,158
But humans have a larger surface area.

307
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,994
Sulforaphane would need
to be applied regularly

308
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,996
over Lydia's entire body,

309
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:21,931
a-almost like a spray.

310
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,066
Which is why we liquefied it.

311
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,435
Voilà, purified sulforaphane.

312
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:28,838
It also took four days to
see results in that study.

313
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,645
Well, we can modify our
hyperbaric oxygen chamber

314
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:32,842
and speed up the healing process.

315
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,693
Yeah, like a horizontal spray tan booth.

316
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:35,711
Exactly.

317
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,732
Inside the chamber,
elevated air pressure

318
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,749
and high oxygen concentration
would stimulate

319
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,618
the body's release of
growth factors and stem cells.

320
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,388
She would need to be in there
for at least eight hours,

321
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,925
and it would only treat the
superficial layer of her skin.

322
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:50,993
Guys, there will be other dances.

323
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:52,662
No, actually, there won't.

324
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,664
There's only one senior prom.

325
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,632
Ooh.

326
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:58,734
Uh...

327
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,336
let's give it a shot.

328
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,938
Fantastic! Angie, let's get to work.

329
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,506
- Thank you, James.
- Yeah.

330
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,673
Louis?

331
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,239
Louis?

332
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,226
Uh...

333
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,261
No, no.

334
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,700
- Was Louis Keating brought down here?
- Uh,

335
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:34,036
- no, I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Bell.
- Okay, thank you.

336
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:51,410
I need you to pull up Louis Keating's

337
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:53,389
location using his tracking bracelet.

338
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:57,126
He's in Golden Gate Park.

339
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,471
Remember, this is just a stopgap measure

340
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,474
to get you to prom. This is not a cure.

341
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,908
Our long-term plan for
a cure is to continue

342
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,377
with the ECP treatments,

343
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,545
which will heal the deeper
layers of your skin.

344
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,047
If this works, I'll never complain

345
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,949
about eating my vegetables again.

346
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,119
Okay, if you need to get
our attention for any reason,

347
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,988
just press this button, and
it will alert us right away.

348
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,090
See you in eight hours.

349
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,133
All set, Doctor.

350
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,070
All right, process initiated.

351
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,239
I feel good about this.

352
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,708
I can't believe James thought
VR would be a good alternative.

353
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,643
See, this is why he needs
a woman in his life.

354
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:50,279
Actually, I think he may soon have one.

355
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,749
You know something.

356
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:54,984
Spill it.

357
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:57,873
Okay, my sources tell me

358
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,323
James has the hots
for the new nurse, Nina.

359
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,793
Nina. Wow.

360
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,795
That's excellent news.

361
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:06,996
That is...

362
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:08,631
that is really excellent.

363
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:11,067
I mean, she's, she's hot.

364
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:13,950
And I told him to move on,

365
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,137
so, so good for him.

366
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,106
That is really excellent.

367
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,255
Said that already.

368
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:19,475
I... Well, it is.

369
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,812
Yeah.

370
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:31,318
Nina!

371
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:34,390
What are you doing here?

372
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,092
Hi, James.

373
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,628
Our new friends Hector and Caleb

374
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,228
are just about to start a new game.

375
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:42,765
I thought, when he wasn't in his room...

376
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:45,234
You can't just...

377
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:48,070
remove a patient from the
hospital without permission.

378
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,411
Come on.

379
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,707
I put in a request,
and I should've waited

380
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,919
for approval. I apologize.

381
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:56,312
But look at him.

382
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,386
He's at peace here.

383
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,351
I could fire you for this.
You know that?

384
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:04,449
Are you, are you going to?

385
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:13,629
Still mulling it over.

386
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:23,189
I wish there was more we could do, too.

387
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:28,611
Louis told me about the new
drug you're developing for GSS.

388
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,380
The PAI-120B.

389
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,215
The FDA didn't approve it.

390
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:34,860
Said it wasn't ready yet.

391
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,021
How long will it take for the
FDA to think it'll be ready?

392
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:40,827
Six to 12 months.

393
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,591
Well, he doesn't have
anywhere near that long.

394
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:44,126
I know.

395
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,900
W-We're going back to the FDA to see

396
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,468
if they'll reverse their decision,

397
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,103
but I'm not...

398
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,685
I'm not gonna go against them.

399
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:01,143
It's too dangerous. I can't...
I can't risk the hospital,

400
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,145
all of the patients. It's not...

401
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,728
- Eh...
- Mm-hmm.

402
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,551
You know, it's funny.

403
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:13,055
Here you are, this billionaire.

404
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:16,547
Started your own hospital so you
could do something different.

405
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,329
But even someone like you
can't get around the system,

406
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,043
even if it's the only way
to save someone's life.

407
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,601
It's not... that simple, Nina.

408
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,046
Isn't it?

409
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:43,656
This is the sequence of
nucleotide base pairs

410
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,481
from Nathan's DNA sample.

411
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,950
I compared his full genome
sequence to a database

412
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:49,555
of all the known genes

413
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,783
and DNA base pair sequences.

414
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,709
There was one sequence

415
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:55,745
that remains unidentified.

416
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,080
An anomalous strand of DNA.

417
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,515
That's our virus.

418
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,883
Most likely.

419
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:02,718
What kind of variant is it?

420
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,387
That's the problem.

421
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:07,123
It doesn't exist
in any of our databases.

422
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:12,117
Are you saying it's
never been seen before?

423
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,876
It may be the DNA of a virus
we've never seen.

424
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,533
But whatever it is,

425
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:19,602
it's not human.

426
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,636
You ready?

427
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:28,892
Oh, my God.

428
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,500
I think I forgot what my
actual skin looked like.

429
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:32,701
Hmm. Yeah,

430
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,403
the epidermis is smoothing out.

431
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,004
And the color looks good.

432
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,121
We still need to monitor

433
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,808
your progress over the next 24 hours,

434
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,977
give your skin a little
more time to heal,

435
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:44,379
but this is very promising.

436
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:46,982
We will be back later to check on you.

437
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:50,919
But be cautious. Your deeper
layers are still fragile.

438
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:08,170
You're saying some
kind of animal did this to him?

439
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,138
Many viral infections originate
in an animal

440
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,541
before crossing over into humans.

441
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:15,010
It's important that we know
exactly what the animal was

442
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,912
in order to know how to treat Nathan.

443
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:19,689
The BiPAP machine
is helping Nathan breathe,

444
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,784
but his diaphragm is steadily weakening.

445
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,320
We're going to need to intubate.

446
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:28,357
You mean put him on life support.

447
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,560
We're just stabilizing him
while we look for a cure.

448
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:33,495
And what if you can't find one?

449
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,398
Does that mean he may never wake up?

450
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,383
It's possible.

451
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,808
You should see the way Bobby
holds Nathan's hand so tight

452
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,350
when we cross the street.

453
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,745
Or when he's scared.

454
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,682
Nathan's the hand-holder in this family.

455
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:55,517
It's all Nathan.

456
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:57,920
He takes care of Bobby.

457
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,275
I work.

458
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,891
I don't know if I could
do this on my own.

459
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:05,961
We're going to do everything we
can so that you don't have to.

460
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:07,629
What am I supposed to tell Bobby

461
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:10,432
if he isn't able to ever say
good-bye to his father?

462
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:15,137
There is a way we can get Nathan
coherent before we intubate.

463
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,127
Dr. Wallace...

464
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,839
If we administer steroids,

465
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,274
it could temporarily reduce the swelling

466
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,037
around his brain and his eye nerve.

467
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,011
But we'd also run the risk
that the steroids could cause

468
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,113
his blood sugar levels to rise again.

469
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:27,382
I know this is what Nathan would want.

470
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,152
He'd risk anything to be able
to talk to Bobby right now.

471
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:32,827
I know. Of course. I understand.

472
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:34,723
The steroids may also weaken
his immune system...

473
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:37,125
We'll be monitoring him closely.

474
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,164
We can do this.

475
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:49,705
Dr. Wallace, that is too much
of a risk to that patient.

476
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,331
Right now we don't have
a path to saving Nathan.

477
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,257
He's a father.

478
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,446
It's possible the best we can do
for him is give him a chance

479
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:59,834
to say good-bye to his family.

480
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,819
You need any help in there?

481
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:04,920
Be careful.

482
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,155
I got this.

483
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:08,336
Ready?

484
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,465
You look absolutely perfect.

485
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:19,901
- I kind of do, don't I?
- Yeah.

486
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,948
Lydia? What's wrong?

487
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,349
Help her, please. I'm so sorry.

488
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,084
I shouldn't have tried to hug her.

489
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,587
I just got carried away.

490
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,689
What happened?

491
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:42,924
The sulforaphane only treated
the outer layer of her skin.

492
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,261
Her deeper layers can't
withstand any sudden movement

493
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,534
or friction.

494
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,637
Topical anesthetic, please.

495
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,801
This spray is a numbing agent
to help with the pain.

496
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,757
I heard what happened to Lydia.

497
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,093
How is she doing?

498
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:22,464
Look, I get that this is
hard for you to understand,

499
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:25,000
but a girl only gets one senior prom,

500
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:27,372
and she's not gonna be able to go.

501
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:31,506
I know I said the prom is evil,
which is true.

502
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:33,475
It's not the whole story.

503
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:39,414
There was this girl, Aubrey Diaz,

504
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,484
and I obsessed for weeks
over how to ask her,

505
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,853
so I made a video

506
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:47,255
of me outlining 16 reasons

507
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:49,958
why Aubrey Diaz should go
to prom with me.

508
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,359
Wow.

509
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:53,228
- That's impressive!
- Mm.

510
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,164
Yeah, would have been, if she
hadn't accepted the invitation

511
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,600
of someone else a few days earlier.

512
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:01,103
Apparently, I was the last to know.

513
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:04,890
And, you know, the hardest part
of the whole thing...

514
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,377
was that I just... missed my window.

515
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,315
With her.

516
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:21,870
So...

517
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,150
tell me about prom.

518
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,563
What am I missing?
Why is it so important?

519
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:33,268
Okay.

520
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,073
So, uh, got really
angry after my mom died.

521
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:40,008
Sort of shut down in high school.

522
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:44,446
Go to class, come home, and I hid.

523
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:46,782
More and more,
I just kind of disappeared.

524
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:48,650
I definitely was not going to prom.

525
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:52,320
But then... this guy asked me.

526
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:54,211
Let's just say

527
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:56,877
he was not the captain
of the football team.

528
00:23:57,551 --> 00:24:00,829
But he was kind and really sweet.

529
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,165
- Mm.
- We had a great time.

530
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:07,536
And... for the first
time since my mom died,

531
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,571
I smiled.

532
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,747
You know?

533
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,509
Felt like I woke up out
of a really long sleep.

534
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,194
When I look at Lydia, I...

535
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:21,249
can kind of see her going down
the same road that I went down,

536
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,984
and I don't want to see that.

537
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:24,219
I don't want that for her.

538
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:25,466
Mm-hmm.

539
00:24:27,603 --> 00:24:28,723
Yeah.

540
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:36,898
Yeah.

541
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:44,918
Nathan?

542
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:47,627
Nathan, my name is Dr. Wallace.

543
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:48,777
Can you hear me?

544
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,412
Yes, I can...

545
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:53,448
Am I in a hospital?

546
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:56,251
I'm sorry to say
you've contracted a virus.

547
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,720
We're having trouble
identifying what it is.

548
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:00,989
So you don't know what's making me sick?

549
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:03,885
Not yet. While we search for a cure,

550
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:06,228
I'm going to need to intubate
you to keep you breathing.

551
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:10,198
I know you're scared, Nathan.

552
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,267
This is the hardest thing in the world.

553
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:14,803
But the best thing for you
to do right now

554
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,938
is to be strong for your son.

555
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,761
You ready?

556
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:28,183
Hey, Bobby.

557
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:31,453
All right, Bobby,
be gentle on your dad, okay?

558
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:33,955
I'm sorry, Daddy. Are you okay?

559
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,924
I'm so okay.

560
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:39,294
Hey, kiddo,
this must be pretty scary, huh?

561
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:40,495
A little.

562
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,197
Listen to me, okay?

563
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:44,199
This is all gonna be okay,

564
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:47,626
and the three of us... this will
all go back to normal, okay?

565
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:49,905
- You promise?
- I promise.

566
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:52,274
Now come here, give Daddy a hug.

567
00:25:52,673 --> 00:25:54,398
A gentle hug.

568
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,979
I love you so much.

569
00:25:57,981 --> 00:25:59,781
I love you, too.

570
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:02,717
Now let your dads talk
for a minute, okay?

571
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,005
Okay.

572
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:06,280
Come on, buddy.

573
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:10,392
Come on, Bobby.
I got something to show you.

574
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,631
I can't believe this is happening.

575
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:20,568
- Listen to me, Seth.
- Yeah.

576
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,871
I know I'm gonna pull
through this, but just in case,

577
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,973
you got to promise me some things, okay?

578
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:27,709
- Okay. Anything.
- Read to Bobby

579
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,078
every night and do the voices.

580
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,280
I know you feel silly, but

581
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:34,282
he loves it. I want him
to grow up in a home

582
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,684
where it's okay to be silly.

583
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,086
Okay, I can do that.

584
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,755
And you need to be the
dad I know you can be.

585
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:43,291
And finish the swing set

586
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:44,926
I was working on in the shed.

587
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:47,128
I cut all that wood myself.

588
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,596
Don't you dare go to Wal-Mart

589
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:51,257
and buy one of those
plastic monstrosities.

590
00:26:57,007 --> 00:27:00,041
Malik, I think I might know
what happened to Nathan.

591
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:03,745
- What is it?
- It's a long shot, but it's a chance.

592
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,480
Let's go find Scott.

593
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,248
We need a search party.

594
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:11,522
We're up against the clock here.

595
00:27:11,524 --> 00:27:14,264
Nathan's been working
in his shed on a swing set

596
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,424
the past few weeks.

597
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,659
Could've come in contact with a bug

598
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:17,893
that may have infected him.

599
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,729
Maybe a beetle, carpenter ant.

600
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:23,332
Sheds are dark and damp.
It's a perfect breeding ground.

601
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:25,834
Okay.

602
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,237
Let's turn this place upside down.

603
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:33,719
Brockett.

604
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,552
I think I found a way
to get Lydia to the prom.

605
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:43,385
This is bionic e-skin.

606
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:44,553
It's being developed
by a company in China

607
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:46,021
to protect the feet of diabetics

608
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:47,523
with peripheral neuropathy,

609
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:50,960
but we have modified it
to cover your entire body.

610
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,828
Serves as a protective barrier

611
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,532
between your skin and any
contact that can cause wounds.

612
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:58,901
The e-skin will also
transmit touch sensation

613
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:01,437
to the nerve in the deeper
layers of your skin.

614
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,839
Layered on the damaged
areas of your skin,

615
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:06,008
almost like a wet suit.

616
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,509
And we'll be there with you at prom,

617
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,278
make sure everything goes
according to plan.

618
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,846
And she'll be able to walk?

619
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:12,414
The blisters in the soles of her feet

620
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,515
are the most painful.

621
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,551
It should also protect her feet.

622
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,720
Let's try it out.

623
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,433
Okay.

624
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:27,129
Uh...

625
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:29,531
Mm.

626
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:33,102
So, I'll have to hold off

627
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:35,971
on flashing my dance moves for awhile,

628
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:38,507
but I still get to go to the prom.

629
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:40,209
Thank you.

630
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:41,977
This is awesome.

631
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:54,523
So, did you ask her about it?

632
00:28:54,757 --> 00:28:56,535
And what am I supposed to say?

633
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:57,826
“I was spying on you

634
00:28:57,828 --> 00:29:00,062
and James having an intimate moment”?

635
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:01,930
Nah.

636
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:03,648
I'm not some jealous dude.

637
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,535
But you were spying on her.

638
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:08,504
No, I wasn't spying on her.

639
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,191
I came across the situation,

640
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:13,042
and that, together
with the taco situation,

641
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,343
I mean, come on.

642
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:15,744
Wouldn't you at least
be a little concerned?

643
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,664
Ah, it's a lot to think about.

644
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:20,816
Probably why I became a priest.

645
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:22,851
Gentlemen.

646
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:24,920
I found something.

647
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:28,357
What is it?

648
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,002
A tick.

649
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:36,999
Mm, it looks like there
might be a small colony of them

650
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,400
living in this pile.

651
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,903
But we already checked
Nathan for Lyme disease.

652
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,805
Well, the tick may be
carrying another disease,

653
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:45,274
one we haven't seen before in humans.

654
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:46,575
Just like swine flu.

655
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,444
It's carried by pigs
and then jumped species.

656
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:52,581
Well, we need to take it back to the lab

657
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,349
to see if it carries
the same disease Nathan has.

658
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:57,553
If it does, could be
the answer to our cure.

659
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:04,159
Hey.

660
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,396
What are you doing here?

661
00:30:07,898 --> 00:30:10,165
Uh... making sure

662
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:13,014
Lydia can dance at her senior prom.

663
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:22,744
Blue LED lights stimulate
the body's natural production

664
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:23,812
of nitric oxide,

665
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:26,748
which improves circulation and

666
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,350
reduces pain.

667
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:30,219
I just got to figure out a way

668
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,695
to fit the soles of these
slippers with these LED lights.

669
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:38,527
What's Cinderella without
her slippers, right?

670
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,818
So, I...

671
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:51,006
heard you might be interested in Nina...

672
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:53,675
new nurse on the third floor.

673
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,482
“Interested”?

674
00:30:57,448 --> 00:30:59,628
Uh, I don't know.

675
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,985
I think it's great.

676
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:06,321
I think you should ask her out.

677
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:10,259
I don't know about that.

678
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:13,412
Aubrey Diaz doesn't know
what she missed out on.

679
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:20,507
Zoe.

680
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:24,431
Ready to head out?

681
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,977
Yeah, you know what, um...

682
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:30,779
I think I should probably stay here

683
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:32,548
and start cutting the e-skin.

684
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:36,318
You can get some sleep.

685
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:37,992
You can do that in the morning.

686
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:39,855
Sure?

687
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:41,723
Yeah.

688
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:43,859
Okay.

689
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,130
Good night, James.

690
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:49,731
Night.

691
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:56,305
So, who's Aubrey Diaz?

692
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:59,541
Oh, it's just this story James told me.

693
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:01,190
I probably shouldn't...

694
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:02,511
Right. No, no. Got it.

695
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:05,022
I guess I just didn't realize

696
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,248
you guys had that kind of relationship.

697
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,183
All these secret things.

698
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,886
- Malik. Come on.
- Look. I'm sorry

699
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,553
I got to ask this, but

700
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,906
something feels off here, Zoe.

701
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:19,394
Did anything ever go on
between you and James?

702
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:22,331
No.

703
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:25,100
Never. We're just friends. That's it.

704
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,218
I heard back from Julianna.

705
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,777
She took it to the top level,
but I'm sorry, James.

706
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:49,370
They're not gonna reverse
their decision.

707
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:51,426
Oh.

708
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:55,897
I'm so sorry, James.

709
00:32:56,968 --> 00:32:58,900
We'll keep him as comfortable as we can.

710
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:00,546
Thank you, W.

711
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:03,805
How is Nathan doing?

712
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:05,697
He's been intubated.

713
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:07,245
And we confirmed the tick's carrying

714
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:08,711
the same virus that infected him.

715
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:12,290
It's a brand new neurosclerotic disease.

716
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:14,042
I alerted the CDC.

717
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:16,011
They're issuing a warning.

718
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,580
How long did it take
the disease to kill the tick?

719
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,505
The tick is still alive,

720
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:22,451
which means its developed antibodies

721
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:24,419
to keep the virus at bay.

722
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,355
So we can harvest the tick's plasma,

723
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:28,824
which contains its natural
immunities to the virus,

724
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:30,392
and inject it into Nathan.

725
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:32,327
That's great news.

726
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:34,897
It's never been tried in humans before.

727
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:36,765
And it is a foreign substance;
Nathan's body

728
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,101
could reject it
completely, or even worse,

729
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:41,870
it could cause his system
to go into a state of shock.

730
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:43,305
What does the FDA say?

731
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:44,806
Well, under their own guidelines,

732
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,174
we don't need to seek approval

733
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:47,342
in an emergency situation.

734
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:50,012
We have hours here.

735
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:51,346
Not days.

736
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:54,049
Good. I'd rather ask for forgiveness

737
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:55,517
than seek permission.

738
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,954
Treatment is a risky move.

739
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:01,752
I'm not entirely comfortable with it.

740
00:34:06,697 --> 00:34:10,128
Do you regret the decision
you made back in Ohio?

741
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:15,737
Giving the boy with leukemia
the unapproved drug?

742
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,205
My gut told me

743
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:24,258
I had to do anything I could
to keep that boy alive.

744
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:26,548
No matter what.

745
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,216
What is your gut telling you now?

746
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,147
That I need a sandwich

747
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:32,354
before I go injecting tick plasma

748
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,957
into a human being
for the first time ever.

749
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:53,852
They can't just be functional.

750
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:56,723
They got to be elegant.

751
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:58,880
And cool.

752
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:02,968
What do you think?

753
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,769
I think that you just added
cobbler to your resume, James.

754
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,171
All right.

755
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:11,241
One last step,

756
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,410
and it's off to the ball.

757
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,925
“At the foot of the mountain,
Henry slowed to a crawl.

758
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,621
“These mountains are much too high”"

759
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,023
“he moaned.

760
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,458
“I can't go. I'm afraid of heights.”

761
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,137
“Don't be silly”"
said Thomas, bravely...

762
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,005
Hey.

763
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,246
Hey.

764
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:57,303
Hey.

765
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,115
- Going home?
- Yep.

766
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,383
About that time.

767
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,651
What's that?

768
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,602
Oh, I made some slippers.

769
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,158
Really cool but elegant ones.

770
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,397
Nina.

771
00:37:18,282 --> 00:37:20,470
Do you want to go to prom with me?

772
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,161
I guess I made it to prom.

773
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,997
I had to strong-arm a junior
for the last of the fruit punch.

774
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,666
Whoa.

775
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,034
Nina, you know Dr. Zoe Brockett.

776
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,135
Hi, yeah,

777
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,470
We've passed in the halls.

778
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,538
That's right. Nice to
officially meet you, at prom.

779
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Mm-hmm.

780
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,481
Oh! Here she comes.

781
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,855
Nice job on that dress.

782
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,890
Thank you.

783
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,144
I can't believe you made it here.

784
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:27,871
E-skin.

785
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,374
Long story, but I'm here, right?

786
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:34,978
Those shoes.

787
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,083
Are they too weird?

788
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,474
They're awesome.

789
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,984
You're awesome.

790
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,156
Come on, Petey Boy, ask her.

791
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,859
Well. Do you want to dance?

792
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,063
Oh, I'm not sure your date
would like that very much.

793
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:54,621
I came alone.

794
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:31,100
Follow my finger with your eyes, please.

795
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:33,703
Yeah.

796
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,938
Looking good.

797
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,839
Your oxygen level's back to normal,

798
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:37,907
and your fever's coming down.

799
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,142
I'm gonna be okay?

800
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,310
You'll need periodic

801
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:41,644
antibody infusions for a few weeks,

802
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:42,861
and physical therapy.

803
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,142
But you're breathing on your own,

804
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,014
and your cognitive function is normal.

805
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,251
So, yeah.

806
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:49,619
You're gonna be okay.

807
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,788
I don't know how to thank you.

808
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,756
You saved my life.

809
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,525
You saved my family.

810
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,361
Well, let's get them in here
so you can celebrate.

811
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:00,897
Daddy!

812
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,832
Hey, kiddo.

813
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,801
Hey, get in there.

814
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:07,437
Hey, you.

815
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:11,040
You scared the hell out of me, Nathan.

816
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,111
What you did for that girl was amazing.

817
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:24,673
Why should they get to have all the fun?

818
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,754
So...

819
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:47,810
I've been thinking

820
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:51,414
about that experimental GSS drug.

821
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,988
Yeah?

822
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,587
What the FDA doesn't know

823
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:00,123
can't hurt them.

824
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,301
Can't hurt me.

825
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,034
Do you trust me, Louis?

826
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,471
I'm lucky to get through
a shift without a disaster.

827
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:57,640
My bargain detergent couldn't keep up.
that I'm asking for. ♪

828
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,208
So, I switched to Tide PODs.

829
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:02,345
They're super concentrated,
so I get a better clean.

830
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,148
Tide. Number one rated.

831
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,683
It's got to be Tide

832
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,854
Ordinary tissues left
Dakota's nose sore and red.

833
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:15,858
So Dad slayed the problem
with Puffs Plus Lotion, instead.

834
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,861
With lotion to soothe
And softness to please.

835
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:22,131
A nose in need deserves Puffs, indeed.

836
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,867
Delicious, freshly brewed
coffee comes at a price...

837
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,169
it's one dollar.

838
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,470
