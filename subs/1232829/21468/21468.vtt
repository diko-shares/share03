1
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,505
- Some cream?
- Thanks.

2
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:48,681
<i>Eternal enigmas of the universe</i>

3
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,751
<i>A few words about the Sun on the
occasion of today's eclipse.</i>

4
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,476
<i>R.I.P. Franciszek Adamczyk
retired captain & bandmaster</i>

5
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,624
<i>Anticipated date of death
October 2, 1933</i>

6
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,502
It's correct.

7
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,653
- You've established contact.
- Yes.

8
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,571
Good morning.
Your ticket, please.

9
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:36,858
- He's controlling a few people.
- At the same time?

10
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:38,709
Yes.

11
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,315
Miss...

12
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:39,045
Rychtel isn't writing,
only smoking a piece of glass.

13
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,016
Why is he controlling them?

14
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,456
He is...

15
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:55,666
...ill.

16
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,882
Terminally ill.

17
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,002
Three people are
heading towards him

18
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:05,541
from different
directions.

19
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,324
Where are these people?

20
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,456
One of them

21
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:22,364
is now in the street.

22
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:27,495
- What street?
- I couldn't read the name.

23
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,910
Who is it?

24
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,656
A man,

25
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,844
40 to 50 years old,

26
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:41,208
wearing a hat, light
trench coat, beard...

27
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:45,093
I can see a house.

28
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,705
Does the house belong
to the medium

29
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,372
you've established
contact with?

30
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,307
Yes.

31
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:53,128
He entered the house.

32
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,419
Follow him.

33
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:08,696
I can't.

34
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,185
The medium won't
let me in.

35
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,718
Where's the second
person?

36
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:27,103
The second person
is on a train.

37
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:07,122
What station is it?

38
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:12,817
Where's the third person?

39
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,207
The third person is
in a museum.

40
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,067
It's a woman.

41
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:05,455
Miss!

42
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,094
Miss!

43
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,091
Something abrupt
has happened.

44
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,266
Is he dead?

45
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,447
Either dead
or unconscious.

46
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,444
Try to reach him.

47
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:08,684
It's impossible.

48
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:12,695
Excuse me, sir,
what city is this?

49
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:15,437
Sir!

50
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,666
I'm very sorry.

51
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:40,876
Miss, miss!

52
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,137
You've left it
on the bench.

53
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:48,408
Thank you.

54
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,120
I don't know
who he is.

55
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:20,630
Nor what he wants.

56
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,147
All I know is that

57
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:28,328
he is an exceptionally
powerful medium.

58
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,992
It stopped bleeding.

59
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,806
Hold on.

60
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,368
Thank you.

61
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,549
Who did this
to you?

62
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:51,637
I don't know.

63
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,249
Damned city.

64
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:01,207
If you don't like our city,
why have you come here?

65
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,412
Precisely. Why?

66
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,668
Have I been
here before?

67
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:16,131
It's the first time
I see you.

68
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:17,816
Are you sure?

69
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,538
Yes.

70
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:25,767
I won't leave until
I've found an answer.

71
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:38,208
It's unacceptable for a teacher
to abandon her classroom.

72
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:40,447
You've got no excuse.

73
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:43,617
Hans claims this
isn't the first time.

74
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,662
Good morning, Inspector.

75
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,982
I see you've
made your choice,

76
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:23,401
Krank.

77
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,075
It's not a question
of convictions, Inspector.

78
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:30,216
Reason demands that I
side with the strongest.

79
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,992
Hurry, while you
still have the chance.

80
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:48,271
- Anything new?
- No.

81
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,281
Not really, except
a phone call.

82
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,940
- Who called?
- Miss Liever, from the museum

83
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:56,726
- on Königstrasse.
- What did she want?

84
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,111
A woman stole a
costume from the exhibit.

85
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:03,602
- What costume?
- A valuable dress, half a century old.

86
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:09,760
That is indeed a very
interesting matter...

87
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:13,234
- ... for the homicide division.
- There is indeed something

88
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:15,768
very interesting about
this affair, Inspector.

89
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,197
Because this woman had
stolen this dress several

90
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,541
times, and then put it
back in its place.

91
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,705
If you're interested in such
matters, transfer to the vice squad.

92
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,515
Every day you'll be
dealing with fetishists,

93
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,398
exhibitionists,
prostitutes.

94
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,737
- Excellent company for your kind.
- Excuse me?

95
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,016
If Miss Liever needs help,
send a squad to the museum,

96
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:42,080
but don't bother
me with nonsense.

97
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,161
- Is that all?
- Yes.

98
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:59,483
At noon, there will be
a total eclipse, Inspector.

99
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:03,009
They say that the phenomenon
triggers acts of aggression.

100
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,617
- They're hungry.
- It's not my fault. It's empty.

101
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:14,003
Orwicz's store,
still closed.

102
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,622
Nine o'clock,
Inspector.

103
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,047
- Krank!
- Yes?

104
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,025
My shirt.

105
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,150
He drinks every day.

106
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,798
And besides,
is late to work.

107
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,265
- Is that all?
- No, Gauleiter.

108
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,025
I suspect that Inspector Selin
is mixed up in a scandal.

109
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:41,143
- In what?
- I don't know what exactly, yet.

110
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:44,038
I just know he hasn't been
spending nights at home.

111
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,727
- Where, then?
- On the beach, in a wicker chair.

112
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:50,381
He was seen there
even today.

113
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:53,866
He comes to work unshaven,
changes his shirt,

114
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:56,484
breeds goldfish,
buys fish food

115
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,533
in Alexander Orwicz's
pet shop.

116
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:00,746
He's also a citizen
of Polish origin...

117
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,710
That's enough, Krank!

118
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:08,348
I need hard facts
to get rid of him,

119
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:11,151
and not a load of rubbish.

120
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,877
- Incredible
- Is anything the matter, Krank?

121
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:44,376
No, now I can
understand Orwicz.

122
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:48,198
In his place, I wouldn't
let anyone in here, either.

123
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,837
- Out of jealousy.
- Nah...

124
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:54,829
He's not so much jealous
as afraid.

125
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:58,779
He believes that their
destinies are bound together.

126
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:00,891
- Orwicz's and the turtles'?
- Yes...

127
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:02,813
One of them. He claims
he's going to die

128
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,052
the same day one
of the turtles drops.

129
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:08,664
Thank you.

130
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:11,171
- It should do for the quarter.
- Inspector...

131
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,473
No one's picking up
at the shopkeeper's house.

132
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,662
- Perhaps he went out?
- Mr. Orwicz would have let us know.

133
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:20,020
He'll be back, I'm sure
he'll be back.

134
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,652
- He's terminally ill.
- What's wrong?

135
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:25,545
- Diabetes.
- Diabetes?

136
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:27,678
Yes, it's hereditary.
After his father.

137
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:31,491
- Is it serious?
- Deadly serious.

138
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:35,527
- I'm very worried about him.
- I didn't know diabetes could kill you.

139
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,638
- Is that what Orwicz senior died of?
- He didn't make it that far.

140
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,997
- He was murdered.
- Murdered?

141
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:48,207
Krank, you've got
such a face,

142
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,861
as if murder, too,
were hereditary.

143
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,048
The turtles are in great shape.

144
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:01,106
- I don't even know where Orwicz lives.
- Sopot. Lindenstrasse, 11.

145
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,282
Stay here.

146
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:52,710
Krank, watch out!

147
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:05,892
Enough!

148
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:09,524
Inspector Selin speaking.

149
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:13,474
Please send an ambulance right
away to Lindenstrasse, 11.

150
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:15,695
Yes, I'm waiting.

151
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:37,609
Name.

152
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:41,137
My name is Netz, Jerzy Netz.

153
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:44,031
I'm a bank clerk

154
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:46,622
I'm married, two children

155
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:50,424
I was born on January 18, 189...

156
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:53,318
...6

157
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:56,806
- Where do you live?
- In Berlin.

158
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,792
Sonnenstrasse, 17.

159
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:02,445
- Where are you staying?
- At the Grand Hotel.

160
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:03,754
Check it out.

161
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,049
It's not your lucky day, Mr. Netz.

162
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:10,871
And all because of my

163
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,223
goldfish.

164
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:15,730
I don't understand.

165
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:22,285
Inspector, I really didn't
do anything wrong.

166
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,092
So why were you
running away?

167
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:36,019
How did you get
in here?

168
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,548
Just like you.

169
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,461
The front door
was open.

170
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,213
- You had an appointment with Orwicz?
- No, no...

171
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,489
Why did you come
to see him?

172
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,264
I don't know.

173
00:23:57,721 --> 00:24:01,924
I don't know him at all,
Inspector.

174
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:07,837
- You're aware of the consequences?
- No.

175
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:17,595
The doctor's asking for you.
To have a word.

176
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,745
He arrived yesterday,
at 4 PM.

177
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,006
He left the hotel
around 11 PM.

178
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,160
Came back this morning,
went out again.

179
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,958
It's not his
first visit.

180
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:45,305
Strange case, inspector.
No injuries.

181
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,311
- Will he regain consciousness?
- I don't know. It might be the heart,

182
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,264
or a stroke, something sudden.

183
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:55,813
- He had diabetes.
- Diabetes...

184
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,171
I haven't thought about it.

185
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,072
I'm taking him
to the hospital.

186
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:07,640
Go with them.

187
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:22,813
But these are all
my own things,

188
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:25,855
look, there's nothing here.
I didn't steal anything.

189
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:30,269
- You slept in this bed?
- Yes, I slept in this bed.

190
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,309
Why not at the hotel?

191
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:35,309
I don't know.

192
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:39,744
What else do you
remember?

193
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:43,436
Afterwards, I woke up...

194
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,225
and I was
sitting over there.

195
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:50,365
- I was sitting over there.
- Sit down.

196
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:52,359
- Sit down?
- Yes, please.

197
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,483
- You write poetry?
- No, not at all.

198
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,988
"I feel rapture and pain
when I see you"

199
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,551
"and it seems I am filled with love,"

200
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,215
"and it seems I am full of loathing.
I could curse you,

201
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,244
and surrender my soul."

202
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:21,942
- It's your handwriting...
- Yes, but...

203
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:25,612
What happened next?

204
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,089
Next, what?

205
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,088
I heard the doorbell.

206
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,151
Right, right. I heard
the doorbell and...

207
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,736
I left the room.

208
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,551
I went downstairs, right,

209
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:45,635
This way...

210
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:49,669
And I went through
this door.

211
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,661
Through this door,
into this room.

212
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:57,492
Yes, it was
in this room.

213
00:26:57,613 --> 00:27:00,301
He was sitting
on the sofa.

214
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,984
Could you show me
how he was sitting.

215
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:07,132
Show you?

216
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,814
- Yes, please.
- Show...

217
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,269
So, well, I don't know...

218
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:16,794
He was sitting
something like this.

219
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:23,404
That's how...

220
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:26,045
Are you sure that is
how he was seated?

221
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,332
Yes.

222
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:30,076
Yes, I am sure...

223
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,610
- Please continue.
- Well, then...

224
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,716
I came over to
this display case...

225
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:38,922
and from this drawer...

226
00:27:39,513 --> 00:27:41,752
I took out a phial,
here it is...

227
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:43,379
and a syringe

228
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,187
I filled the syringe

229
00:27:46,518 --> 00:27:49,474
Like this. I drew the content
into the syringe.

230
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:56,930
And I went over
to the other one...

231
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,934
and gave him a shot.

232
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:01,236
What other one?

233
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,699
The one seated in the chair.

234
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:08,205
- There was someone else here?
- Yes...

235
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:12,431
It was happening all
at the same time, Inspector.

236
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:14,670
They both had an attack.

237
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,099
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

238
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:19,272
Please show me
how he was seated.

239
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:22,968
Well, he was seated.

240
00:28:25,918 --> 00:28:26,847
Like this.

241
00:28:28,431 --> 00:28:29,994
He was seated like this.

242
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,902
- Would you recognize him?
- No, probably not.

243
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:38,570
He had a hat pulled
over his eyes,

244
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:40,218
I saw a beard...

245
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,585
light trench coat...

246
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:46,156
I gave him a shot

247
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,184
in his right hand.

248
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,571
- What medication is this?
- I don't know.

249
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,815
And then?

250
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:02,562
Then he got up.

251
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:05,434
He got up and...

252
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:08,686
And started towards
the exit, but walked

253
00:29:08,806 --> 00:29:11,811
very strange, as if
he were blind.

254
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:14,051
He knocked
over this chair.

255
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,967
And left.
I picked up the chair,

256
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:19,480
put it back in its place...

257
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,937
Then?

258
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:23,386
Then I started to be
terribly afraid.

259
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:25,412
What I am doing here?

260
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:28,792
Before me was seated a man
whom I didn't know,

261
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:30,651
moreover unconscious.

262
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,265
In my hand, I was
holding a syringe.

263
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:35,778
But I don't even know
how to give a shot.

264
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:39,650
I put the syringe back.

265
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,565
Replaced it in the drawer.

266
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:46,407
I even wanted to
call the ambulance,

267
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:49,407
but I thought that
I would get involved.

268
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:50,842
I decided not to.

269
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:51,842
I ran away.

270
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:53,911
- Where?
- To the hotel.

271
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:56,635
- So why did you come back?
- Because of the suitcase.

272
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,614
I realized at the hotel
that I'd left my suitcase behind.

273
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:17,472
Inspector, I must leave this place.
Immediately. Please let me go.

274
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:20,238
You won't be going
anywhere.

275
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,800
Then please arrest me.

276
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,453
And put me behind iron bars,
so nothing could break me out.

277
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:29,010
You understand?

278
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:31,481
I've no reason to arrest you.

279
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,064
You'll go back
to the hotel.

280
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:40,661
Please stay
in your room.

281
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,344
You take interest
in this subject?

282
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:55,287
Yes, a little bit.

283
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:01,138
I've got something
for you.

284
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:13,598
A rare volume.

285
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,509
"Key to Arcane Knowledge"

286
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:29,819
These prophecies
are unverifiable.

287
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:32,585
The people concerned
are already dead.

288
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:37,141
I also have a book of horoscopes
for people presently alive.

289
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:42,675
It foretells the future.

290
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:51,504
Dates of death
aren't listed.

291
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:55,010
That can't be published.

292
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:58,122
But the author of the book,
Wagner, knows them.

293
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:01,270
He keeps them
in sealed envelopes.

294
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,064
In his office.

295
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:07,293
He lives in this building
on the third floor.

296
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:09,637
With his sister.

297
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,023
Where were you born?

298
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,387
In Warsaw.

299
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,683
Please give me your
exact date of birth.

300
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,572
November 17, 1902.

301
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:34,028
- Time?
- Six... in the morning

302
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:35,508
Six o'clock?

303
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:38,182
Yes...

304
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:42,976
- Does it matter?
- Every minute may change things.

305
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:46,988
If you want to obtain
precise results, you need to

306
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:49,367
clock in the moment
of birth.

307
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,302
I advise it to
all parents.

308
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,734
Parapsychology
is like mathematics.

309
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:06,494
Some think that
a parapsychologist should have

310
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:08,120
a cat,

311
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
a crystal ball,

312
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,569
some Egyptian divinity,
a stuffed crocodile, and...

313
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:17,093
the walls painted black.

314
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:20,030
While everything is
contained within the brain.

315
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,049
In the brain resides the
secret of whether one

316
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:25,499
will become a great
mathematician,

317
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:29,618
politician, or
a composer.

318
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:36,908
Those letters everywhere.

319
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:40,455
If he wanted to reply
to every single one,

320
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,792
he'd go through
his whole pension.

321
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,216
After all, one must have
something to live on.

322
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:55,819
- Will you take sugar or preserves?
- Preserves, if I may.

323
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:59,118
Good choice.

324
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,020
I made them myself.

325
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:08,687
Most letters come
from madmen.

326
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:12,784
Or those who ask
for a horoscope.

327
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,043
You must have come
for the same reason.

328
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,075
Yes, as a matter of fact.

329
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,784
I've never let him
do my horoscope.

330
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:28,970
- And I would advise you against it.
- But why?

331
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,706
<i>Anticipated date of death</i>

332
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:53,035
Today.

333
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:58,377
Be careful.

334
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:01,482
He may be one of the
people controlled by the medium.

335
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,030
It's excellent.

336
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:11,250
If you drink the whole cup,
I'll make you some more.

337
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:23,915
Why have you come
to Gdansk?

338
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:25,583
I don't know.

339
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:29,576
I can't remember
leaving the house.

340
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,956
I can't remember
boarding the train.

341
00:35:33,336 --> 00:35:35,512
I regained my consciousness
only here, at the train station.

342
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,215
Is this the first time
this has happened to you?

343
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:41,320
No, I had taken off
several times before.

344
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:45,017
But I can't remember anything
from my previous journeys.

345
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:47,467
Have you ever talked
to anyone about it?

346
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:49,234
I've seen a doctor.

347
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,664
He claims I suffer from
blackouts.

348
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:56,056
These aren't blackouts.

349
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:59,626
You are in a trance.

350
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:02,139
You are being controlled
by someone who

351
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:06,089
has hold of your will.
You are entirely in his power.

352
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:12,747
- No, that's impossible.
- He can make you do anything.

353
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:16,675
If your brain receives the
order: "Kill him",

354
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:18,914
you will kill me.

355
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,479
I can't stand it.

356
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:33,457
It would be horrible.

357
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:36,225
If they used him,

358
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:39,477
he'd become a terrible
weapon in their hands.

359
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:43,052
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

360
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:44,870
I don't know who it is.

361
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:49,199
All I know is that

362
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:51,124
he's an exceptionally
powerful medium.

363
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,490
Medium?

364
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,086
Yes, he lives in the city.

365
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:01,831
Am I in any danger?

366
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:07,808
Mortal danger.

367
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:13,320
You must leave
Gdansk immediately.

368
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,770
Before the eclipse.

369
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,072
Catch a train, and
leave the city right away.

370
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:21,302
You must get out of here.
It's your only chance.

371
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:30,342
The last stage of
diabetes, Inspector: coma.

372
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:35,557
You really intend to
investigate this matter?

373
00:37:38,387 --> 00:37:41,343
I would just like to know
the cause of this disease.

374
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,857
Diabetes is caused by
insulin deficiency in the organism.

375
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:48,181
It's a hormone excreted
by pancreas.

376
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:52,083
To stave off the disaster,
we administer it orally

377
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,730
or by injection.

378
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,138
At regular intervals.

379
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,000
This means that
if the patient

380
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,921
doesn't get his dose
of insulin on time...

381
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:03,224
This is the result.

382
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,638
Nurse!
Excuse me.

383
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:15,906
- You look beautiful.
- Doctor!

384
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:18,946
This could be a way
of killing him.

385
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,923
Diabetics have a choice:

386
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:27,661
either to remain in the hospital
for the rest of their lives,

387
00:38:27,994 --> 00:38:30,127
or attend treatment
sessions

388
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:32,134
at appointed hours.

389
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:33,232
Orwicz,

390
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:36,481
like most patients, belonged
to the second category.

391
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,199
And...?

392
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:42,789
He didn't show up
last night.

393
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,577
You haven't tried
to find out why?

394
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:49,784
Orwicz is not the only one.
We've got hundreds similar cases.

395
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:53,015
He was aware of
the consequences.

396
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:55,507
Besides, he started
treatment too late.

397
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,534
Diabetes had already
damaged his kidneys.

398
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,914
Complications from TB,

399
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,174
atherosclerosis.

400
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:04,984
Incurable.

401
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:07,686
- Did he know that?
- Yes.

402
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,902
I had informed him.

403
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:16,542
Could this be suicide?

404
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:21,211
That's what I'd like
to talk to you about.

405
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:33,705
- This way.
- I'll be there in a second.

406
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:37,169
- I'll be in my office
- Thank you.

407
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:45,625
Check out all information
concerning Orwicz.

408
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,391
Everything available.
Do you understand?

409
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,720
In the archives, you'll find
his father's files. Check them out.

410
00:39:52,944 --> 00:39:55,057
- Along with photos.
- Understood.

411
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:57,592
Be careful.

412
00:39:57,712 --> 00:40:00,464
- Does this mean, Inspector...
- It doesn't mean anything. Be careful.

413
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:13,641
- All files concerning this case are lost.
- How is that possible?

414
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,491
- Possible, possible.
- Have you checked everywhere?

415
00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:22,206
If you don't trust me,
see for yourself.

416
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:45,662
Gone.

417
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:48,619
There was the war.

418
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:52,380
Some documents
were lost in the fire.

419
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,718
Others were simply
misplaced.

420
00:40:56,984 --> 00:40:58,842
Is this your first case?

421
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:00,869
The first.

422
00:41:01,496 --> 00:41:02,826
Orwicz.

423
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:07,958
Where did I...?

424
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:12,050
A woman was the reason
behind the whole tragedy.

425
00:41:13,002 --> 00:41:14,775
Her name was Zofia.

426
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:16,929
If I'm not mistaken.

427
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:19,857
You know, I used to
have an exceptional

428
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,822
memory for names.

429
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:24,209
Unfortunately, at present...

430
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:26,045
But...

431
00:41:26,638 --> 00:41:29,658
Where could I have read
about it, what do you think?

432
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:32,952
I don't know.

433
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:36,282
Please try to remember,
it's very important to me.

434
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:37,338
Very.

435
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:41,056
Unfortunately, I can't
recall.

436
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:43,224
It's not your lucky day.

437
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:46,434
Goodbye.

438
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:48,801
Just a minute!

439
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:52,814
I seem to recall
something.

440
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:56,974
The murderer's name
was Victor.

441
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:00,760
- Victor?
- Victor Arlt.

442
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:05,997
Why are you playing
cat and mouse with me?

443
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:08,912
Nothing of the sort.
Please, sit down.

444
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:15,661
Arlt went mad.

445
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:19,426
What triggered it?

446
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:21,152
Ah! And how can a woman

447
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:24,183
drive a man mad?

448
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,760
Mr. Krauze, can you imagine
how many madmen we'd

449
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,508
have if every man were
driven mad like that.

450
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:36,343
There is love, and
then there is betrayal.

451
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,399
To some, betrayal
doesn't mean much.

452
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,176
- But to others...
- I pity them.

453
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:43,899
Mr. Krank...

454
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,044
This is at times the cause
of great tragedies.

455
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:50,361
If you don't believe me,

456
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,820
- you can go and read about it.
- But where?

457
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:57,169
Over there.
Just above your head.

458
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:01,128
Go ahead and find

459
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,611
<i>Gazeta Gdanska</i>

460
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:07,024
year 1897.

461
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:14,725
October.

462
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,066
Remember, Krank,

463
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:22,890
newspapers are a treasure
trove of knowledge

464
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,242
for future generations.

465
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:27,465
And they have the
advantage

466
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:30,756
of being printed in
a great number of copies.

467
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,926
It will never be possible
to destroy every last one.

468
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:37,782
Found it!

469
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,091
<i>Murder Weapon: Axe</i>

470
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:44,726
<i>Cruel Murder In House Of Stefan Orwicz.</i>

471
00:44:37,824 --> 00:44:39,661
I'm sorry.

472
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:59,112
<i>The braggart stood facing the corner,</i>

473
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:03,577
<i>and sung her own praise:</i>

474
00:45:04,143 --> 00:45:08,422
<i>"I am clever beyond belief"...</i>

475
00:45:33,111 --> 00:45:35,067
Stefan Orwicz built it

476
00:45:35,187 --> 00:45:38,013
in 1891 for his wife.

477
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:41,159
Total confusion of styles:

478
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:43,843
Italian Renaissance exterior,
and Gdansk interiors.

479
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,261
- Who was he?
- A banker.

480
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:48,411
An affluent banker.

481
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:51,308
He traveled extensively.

482
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:54,987
Orwicz's only son,
Aleksander, was born precisely

483
00:45:55,268 --> 00:45:59,090
on March 27, 1893.

484
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:15,547
Zofia Orwicz was 22
when their son was born.

485
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,376
- And Stefan Orwicz?
- 46.

486
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:23,695
When the boy was 2,
Stefan Orwicz fell ill.

487
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:26,095
He was diagnosed
with diabetes.

488
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:29,163
The patient's state
was considered critical.

489
00:46:33,464 --> 00:46:36,344
At the beginning of 1897,
he went blind.

490
00:46:37,975 --> 00:46:39,451
- Repeat.
- He couldn't see.

491
00:46:40,642 --> 00:46:42,810
Dr. Malicki moved
in with the Orwiczes.

492
00:46:47,285 --> 00:46:48,815
He lived in this room.

493
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:53,684
Dr. Malicki watched over
Stefan Orwicz

494
00:46:53,803 --> 00:46:54,929
at Zofia's request.

495
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,554
And in his spare time,
became her lover.

496
00:47:01,674 --> 00:47:02,549
Correct.

497
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:04,593
Stefan Orwicz
continued to live,

498
00:47:04,713 --> 00:47:06,904
so they decided
to get rid of him.

499
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:09,293
Simple.

500
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:11,356
No, Inspector.

501
00:47:11,476 --> 00:47:12,672
It gets more
complicated.

502
00:47:13,222 --> 00:47:15,408
Because, you see,
they were all...

503
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:16,937
... murdered.

504
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:20,160
Yes.

505
00:47:20,586 --> 00:47:23,360
Mr. and Mrs. Orwicz, and
Malicki were murdered by

506
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:24,728
Victor Arlt.

507
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:27,590
Stefan Orwicz's assistant
and personal secretary.

508
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,455
Yes.

509
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,010
He murdered them
out of jealousy.

510
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:34,827
Yes.

511
00:47:35,254 --> 00:47:36,924
Fiery woman...

512
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,261
the husband,
two lovers...

513
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,605
No, one.

514
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:46,054
Arlt was madly in love
with her.

515
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,241
But it was Platonic
love.

516
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:51,099
They always say that.

517
00:47:51,846 --> 00:47:54,121
- To make things look better.
- But it's true.

518
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,698
Inspector, she was
a very beautiful woman.

519
00:47:57,238 --> 00:47:58,803
Whereas Arlt
had a deformity.

520
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:02,214
- What?
- He was a hunchback.

521
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:06,088
Do you have his
photograph?

522
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:08,311
No, but I transcribed
a poem.

523
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:11,293
Because he wrote
her poetry, Inspector.

524
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,519
Here you go.

525
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:16,234
<i>I feel rapture and pain
when I see you</i>

526
00:48:16,975 --> 00:48:18,911
<i>and it seems I am filled with love...</i>

527
00:48:19,782 --> 00:48:21,684
For there is love
and there is betrayal.

528
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:24,547
To some, betrayal doesn't
mean much. To others...

529
00:48:25,326 --> 00:48:26,695
Inspector,

530
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:28,686
At times, this is the cause
of real tragedies.

531
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,197
Listen...

532
00:48:30,961 --> 00:48:32,472
Where did they die?

533
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:34,250
In Mrs. Orwicz's bedroom.

534
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,740
And Stefan Orwicz...?

535
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,001
Stefan Orwicz
died in this chair.

536
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:00,688
How did he die?

537
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:02,501
They all died
the same way.

538
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,042
From axe blows.

539
00:49:06,205 --> 00:49:08,319
- Axe?
- Yes. On the head.

540
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:11,040
Arlt was in frenzy.
He went mad.

541
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:14,274
When did it happen?

542
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,235
October 3, 1897.

543
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:29,717
Dr. Malicki's watch

544
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:31,725
stopped

545
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:33,342
at 1:09 pm.

546
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:35,264
That means...

547
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,542
that in an hour it'll
be the 36th anniversary.

548
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:53,102
What happened
to Arlt?

549
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:55,253
He committed suicide.

550
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:59,705
But I see that you are
familiar with the story.

551
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:27,896
I'm looking for the
Orwicz family grave.

552
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:30,189
The main alley.

553
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:32,980
With a white statue
of a woman.

554
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,876
<i>ZOFIA  EMILIA ORWICZ
née Hoffman
aged 27
died 3.10.1897</i>

555
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:08,375
<i>STEFAN JERZY ORWICZ
aged 51
died 3.10.1897</i>

556
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:33,348
Open up. Police!

557
00:51:45,587 --> 00:51:46,565
He went mad.

558
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,752
I'm not mad.

559
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,982
- Can I help you?
- Leave me alone.

560
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:55,435
- Can I help you?
- No.

561
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:57,772
No one can help me.

562
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:02,731
Sir, Inspector Selin
has sent me.

563
00:52:03,263 --> 00:52:05,361
We need your passport.

564
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:09,638
Please give it to me, or I'll
have to force my way in.

565
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:50,973
Inspector...

566
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:54,936
Did you get it?

567
00:53:00,365 --> 00:53:02,284
Netz barricaded himself
in his room,

568
00:53:02,404 --> 00:53:04,098
tied himself
to a chair.

569
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:05,627
He must have
gone mad.

570
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,784
No, he's not
crazy.

571
00:53:09,832 --> 00:53:11,147
He's afraid.

572
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:12,801
What's he afraid of?

573
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:14,737
Sit down.

574
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:23,668
Here. Have a drink.

575
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:31,539
To your health, Krank.

576
00:53:39,502 --> 00:53:41,707
You drink, Krank,
like a bird.

577
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,647
When were you born?

578
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:48,290
In 1909, Inspector.

579
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:53,515
Let's say you wanted
to be in 1913.

580
00:53:53,635 --> 00:53:55,060
What for?

581
00:53:55,912 --> 00:53:58,473
To be once more
four years old.

582
00:54:00,197 --> 00:54:03,218
- What would you need?
- Memory, Inspector.

583
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:05,582
OK, true, Krank.

584
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,277
But let's assume that you
have limitless possibilities.

585
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:13,488
Time is not a
filing cabinet, Inspector.

586
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:15,905
How do you know
it's not?

587
00:54:17,202 --> 00:54:19,566
I had never been
in Orwicz's house.

588
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,054
But I know the
house by heart.

589
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:29,458
Krank, perhaps we
are traveling through time.

590
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:33,456
Perhaps time is a form
of space.

591
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:36,246
If there were someone...

592
00:54:42,308 --> 00:54:43,961
Drink, drink...

593
00:54:48,316 --> 00:54:50,413
It's October, 1913.

594
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:54,732
The time is...
twelve...

595
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,354
twenty seven.

596
00:54:56,995 --> 00:54:59,127
You're walking
along the pier.

597
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:02,629
With your mother, father,
your sister, your brother...

598
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:05,718
What do you need to
go back there?

599
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:07,779
People who accompanied
me then.

600
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:10,089
Yes. Very good, Krank.

601
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,081
The same people
as back then.

602
00:55:12,365 --> 00:55:13,627
What else?

603
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,157
Well, the place.

604
00:55:15,276 --> 00:55:16,790
Good, good, Krank.

605
00:55:18,087 --> 00:55:20,291
- Now, do you understand?
- No.

606
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:26,021
Krank, you are blind, obedient,
and lack imagination.

607
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:27,959
You'll make a good cop.

608
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:34,678
- Why don't you understand?
- Because these people are gone.

609
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:37,788
My father and brother are dead,
my mother is an old woman,

610
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:39,992
and my sister got married,
and has her own kids.

611
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:42,509
And besides, she grew
fat and got ugly.

612
00:55:44,481 --> 00:55:47,042
- Krank, those people can be replaced.
- How?

613
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:48,765
With their doubles.

614
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:52,017
Zofia Orwicz.

615
00:55:53,068 --> 00:55:54,632
Doctor Malicki.

616
00:55:55,734 --> 00:55:57,369
Arlt, Victor.

617
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:58,755
The hunchback.

618
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:08,231
Inspector, these really
are doubles.

619
00:56:08,622 --> 00:56:10,951
He had been looking
for them. Since the day

620
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,936
he learned he was
terminally ill.

621
00:56:13,056 --> 00:56:15,389
He brought Arlt's double
from Berlin,

622
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,215
and Malicki's, we don't
know yet where from.

623
00:56:18,335 --> 00:56:21,664
Zofia Orwicz's double
probably lives in Sopot.

624
00:56:22,765 --> 00:56:24,827
And Stefan Orwicz's double?

625
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,862
Also lives in Sopot.

626
00:56:28,982 --> 00:56:30,533
What does he
look like?

627
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:34,615
I don't know. I don't
have his photo, yet.

628
00:56:35,966 --> 00:56:38,330
Do you really
suppose that

629
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:40,552
that everything is
going to repeat?

630
00:56:40,672 --> 00:56:42,738
That the crime will
be committed again?

631
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:45,838
- That's precisely it.
- But why, what for?

632
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:49,198
So that Aleksander Orwicz

633
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:53,090
could once again become
a four-year-old boy.

634
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:56,461
Tell me, where was he
during the murder?

635
00:56:57,386 --> 00:56:58,825
In the playroom.

636
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,433
Nobody could explain why
Arlt had not killed him.

637
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:05,979
The playroom.

638
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:09,728
I once heard about
the eye of the hurricane.

639
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,585
All around, the storm is raging,
killing everything,

640
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:16,140
but whoever finds himself
in the eye of the storm

641
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,237
is completely safe.

642
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,881
They say that those who
once were in the eye

643
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:25,148
of the storm, dream
of returning there.

644
00:57:25,268 --> 00:57:26,979
Inspector, that means

645
00:57:27,353 --> 00:57:30,035
that Aleksander Orwicz uncovered
the secret of immortality.

646
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:32,115
The secret of immor...

647
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:34,603
That's absurd.

648
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:36,202
Absurd, Inspector.

649
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:39,367
This is a case for Wagner,
and not for the homicide division.

650
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:40,911
Say that name again.

651
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:43,772
Wagner. Occultist
and parapsychologist.

652
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,776
Member of the London Lodge
of the Theosophical Society.

653
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:48,517
Of world renown.

654
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:54,099
This is the best piece of
information I ever got from you.

655
00:57:55,007 --> 00:57:57,743
- Wagner...
- He's a charlatan.

656
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:00,582
His name is Orwicz.

657
00:58:01,986 --> 00:58:03,604
Aleksander Orwicz.

658
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,791
He lives in Sopot.

659
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,793
On Lindenstrasse, 11.

660
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,266
He's the owner
of a pet shop.

661
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,087
Diabetic.

662
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:20,424
This morning, he
lost consciousness.

663
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:23,782
At this moment, he's in a hospital,
in Dr. Mincel's ward.

664
00:58:24,725 --> 00:58:26,556
First floor, room no. 2.

665
00:58:30,252 --> 00:58:31,922
Do you believe history
may repeat itself?

666
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:34,945
Does it matter to you if
I believe or not?

667
00:58:35,065 --> 00:58:37,717
The worst thing is that
I can't help you.

668
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:40,591
Nothing can stop this?

669
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:43,579
Yes, but it would be
necessary to kill Orwicz

670
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,438
or one of the people
he controls.

671
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,258
Let's be realistic.
If you do it,

672
00:58:48,378 --> 00:58:50,781
you'll be declared
clinically insane,

673
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:53,394
and locked up in an
asylum for the rest of your life.

674
00:58:53,661 --> 00:58:55,776
Or yet, what's more
likely,

675
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:58,088
tried for murder.

676
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:01,216
A nice prospect
for a police inspector.

677
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:02,994
I could try.

678
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:04,930
Orwicz won't let
you kill him.

679
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:07,348
There was a moment
when it was possible,

680
00:59:07,468 --> 00:59:09,677
but then we had no
idea who he was.

681
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,267
These pictures are
the best evidence

682
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:14,955
that he made
a mistake.

683
00:59:15,075 --> 00:59:17,359
He hadn't foreseen
he'd be in a coma.

684
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,891
- He's still in a coma.
- Now it's too late.

685
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:24,961
His brain is functioning
normally.

686
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:26,828
How do you know?

687
00:59:27,534 --> 00:59:29,348
I advise against trying.

688
00:59:29,828 --> 00:59:32,938
He is an exceptionally
powerful medium.

689
00:59:35,497 --> 00:59:36,884
Medium.

690
00:59:38,395 --> 00:59:39,834
Another medium.

691
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:41,577
What did you say?

692
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:45,185
We must find
another medium

693
00:59:45,304 --> 00:59:47,620
who will neutralize
Orwicz with his power.

694
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,058
OK, but where to
find such a medium?

695
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:54,109
I don't know anyone as
powerful as Orwicz.

696
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:57,860
A duel of mediums.

697
01:00:10,492 --> 01:00:13,976
- It's our last chance.
- And even if I did know...

698
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:17,033
I'd never allow
such a duel.

699
01:00:17,154 --> 01:00:18,188
Why not?

700
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,845
Orwicz will destroy
the brain of anyone

701
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:22,996
who should attempt
to oppose him.

702
01:00:23,725 --> 01:00:25,360
He's fighting
for his life.

703
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,758
So am I.

704
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:38,201
You must help me.

705
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:58,137
My God!

706
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,091
Greta!

707
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,412
Deputy Krank.

708
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:07,225
She came here again.

709
01:02:07,529 --> 01:02:09,394
- Who?
- That woman.

710
01:02:11,276 --> 01:02:12,999
She took the dress.

711
01:02:49,997 --> 01:02:51,276
Grand Hotel?

712
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:52,930
Room 420.

713
01:03:33,088 --> 01:03:34,883
This is a once in
a lifetime chance.

714
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,608
No change.

715
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:40,528
Strange.

716
01:04:43,736 --> 01:04:45,691
Faster, I beg you.

717
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:48,659
Damn it!

718
01:04:49,246 --> 01:04:50,916
I must make it...

719
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,916
I saw the ball of wool
roll under the bed.

720
01:05:16,504 --> 01:05:17,749
Don't be afraid.

721
01:05:18,016 --> 01:05:20,149
Everyone is watching
the eclipse.

722
01:05:21,696 --> 01:05:23,722
Nobody is going
to come in.

723
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,157
What about him?

724
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:31,556
He's in a coma.

725
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:12,293
Son of Satan! These are
the times of Satan!

726
01:08:02,772 --> 01:08:03,857
Beautiful.

727
01:08:14,485 --> 01:08:16,262
I have bad news.

728
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:18,485
The doctor is
leaving.

729
01:08:19,355 --> 01:08:20,315
You're lying.

730
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:22,797
He's packing.

731
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,459
Why should I care?

732
01:08:32,048 --> 01:08:35,035
- Where's Alex?
- In his room. Sleeping.

733
01:08:37,274 --> 01:08:40,242
Anyway, Malicki's
a coward.

734
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,849
He has courage to
see you only at night,

735
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:44,841
when everyone else
is sleeping.

736
01:08:46,014 --> 01:08:48,164
You've told my husband about
it, you snitch.

737
01:08:48,449 --> 01:08:49,568
No.

738
01:08:50,204 --> 01:08:53,295
If I had, your husband
would be dead.

739
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:19,467
I feel rapture and pain

740
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:21,156
when I see you,

741
01:09:21,898 --> 01:09:24,672
and it seems I am filled with love,

742
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:28,331
and it seems I am full of loathing:

743
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,354
I could curse you,

744
01:09:31,473 --> 01:09:33,168
and surrender my soul.

745
01:09:34,074 --> 01:09:37,505
Plunged in the silvery
blue of your eyes,

746
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:41,806
I could cast my life
at your feet,

747
01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:45,891
and yet a mad desire
swells in my chest

748
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:48,699
to slay you with
a single glance.

749
01:09:49,446 --> 01:09:52,396
For I would rather
see you wed to death

750
01:09:52,945 --> 01:09:56,448
than intertwined
in another's arms.

751
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,572
Beautiful.

752
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:03,258
- Did you write it for me?
- Yes.

753
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,223
God, you're burning up.

754
01:10:14,663 --> 01:10:15,942
He's having an attack.

755
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:18,075
Don't go.

756
01:10:38,241 --> 01:10:40,231
You mustnt get up.

757
01:10:40,832 --> 01:10:42,876
Please sit down.

758
01:10:44,263 --> 01:10:45,543
I'll call the doctor.

759
01:10:53,007 --> 01:10:54,075
Hurry...

760
01:11:10,745 --> 01:11:12,043
Is there anyone?

761
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:19,703
I dreamt...

762
01:11:20,374 --> 01:11:22,099
that I could see

763
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:25,192
and walk.

764
01:11:43,862 --> 01:11:45,996
Perhaps some other
doctor knows a

765
01:11:46,116 --> 01:11:47,985
miracle cure for diabetes,
but I don't.

766
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:49,303
I'm leaving.

767
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:51,944
Don't.

768
01:11:55,961 --> 01:11:57,329
You won't leave.

769
01:11:58,235 --> 01:11:59,730
He fired me.

770
01:12:09,715 --> 01:12:11,564
I love you, you coward.

771
01:12:12,071 --> 01:12:13,564
Get dressed.

772
01:12:13,919 --> 01:12:15,005
I won't.

773
01:12:16,372 --> 01:12:17,545
You're afraid?

774
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,685
Those in love

775
01:12:27,804 --> 01:12:29,142
have nothing to hide.

776
01:12:33,602 --> 01:12:35,628
The hunchback
will rat on us.

777
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:40,906
That's good.

778
01:12:42,927 --> 01:12:44,545
If he rats on us

779
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:46,784
he won't survive it.

780
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,512
God! Help!

781
01:16:58,922 --> 01:17:00,451
Marvelous.

782
01:17:04,575 --> 01:17:06,193
You're wonderful.

783
01:20:23,364 --> 01:20:25,320
The eye of the hurricane.

784
01:21:26,124 --> 01:21:27,368
Where's the boy?

785
01:21:27,972 --> 01:21:29,927
Where is the boy?

786
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,994
He was murdered just
like Stefan Orwicz.

787
01:22:49,281 --> 01:22:50,758
Selin was his double.

788
01:22:58,124 --> 01:22:59,990
Dr. Mincel's expert opinion.

789
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:05,127
Diabetes.

790
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:09,642
Dr. Mincel had examined
Selin two hours before his death.

791
01:23:09,762 --> 01:23:10,974
He was in good health.

792
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:17,801
- Dr. Mincel might have been wrong.
- This did happen.

793
01:23:18,353 --> 01:23:19,916
This really did happen.

794
01:23:21,178 --> 01:23:23,399
Aleksander Orwicz
disappeared from the hospital.

795
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:27,555
Now he's four
years old.

796
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:31,287
Here's a proof
that he is alive.

797
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,543
Take this away.

798
01:23:40,898 --> 01:23:42,390
Gauleiter,

799
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:45,393
this is not just a
matter of immortality.

800
01:23:46,405 --> 01:23:48,111
With the help of this boy,
we'll be able to

801
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:49,551
control people remotely,

802
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:51,115
kill without leaving
a trace.

803
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:53,034
He's a weapon
of limitless possibilities.

804
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:54,531
I know how
to catch him.

805
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,191
This would be a wonderful
gift for our Führer.

806
01:24:47,867 --> 01:24:49,999
He's been sitting
with the turtles for 6 hours.

807
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,350
He must have
gone crazy.

808
01:24:58,621 --> 01:25:00,062
Take me there.

809
01:25:24,603 --> 01:25:26,737
It's long past midnight.

810
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,673
And the turtles
are still swimming.

811
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:31,160
It's the best proof
that Orwicz is alive.

812
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,168
That's enough, Krank.

813
01:25:33,288 --> 01:25:34,592
Go home.

814
01:25:35,738 --> 01:25:38,191
I can't leave
this place. Can't.

815
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:41,817
I am certain
he is going to come.

816
01:25:48,259 --> 01:25:50,766
Their destinies
are bound together.

817
01:25:52,383 --> 01:25:53,913
I got him.

818
01:26:06,408 --> 01:26:07,545
Take him away.

819
01:26:57,454 --> 01:27:00,262
Let me go! He's going to
come! I told you!

820
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:03,782
He's a total weapon!
Let me go!

821
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:09,953
That is little Orwicz!

822
01:27:11,945 --> 01:27:13,917
Let me go!

823
01:27:14,037 --> 01:27:16,085
These are limitless
possibilities.
