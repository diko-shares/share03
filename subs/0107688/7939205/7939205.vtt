<i>'Twas a long time ago</i>
<i>Longer now than it seems

2
00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.774
<i>In a place that perhaps</i>
<i>you've seen in your dreams

3
00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.527
<i>For the story</i>
<i>that you are about to be told

4
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.655
<i>Took place</i>
<i>in the holiday worlds of old

5
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.158
<i>Now, you've probably wondered</i>
<i>where holidays come from

6
00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:18.787
<i>If you haven't, I'd say</i>
<i>It's time you begun!

7
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:37.681
<i>Boys and girls of every age

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.950
<i>Something's waiting now to pounce</i>

30
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:44.247

<i>Say it once, say it twice</i>
<i>Take a chance and roll the dice

32
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.045

<i>In our town of Halloween

35
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.928
<i>I am the clown</i>
<i>with the tear-away face

36
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.972
<i>Here in a flash</i>
<i>and gone without a trace

37
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.934
<i>I am the who</i>
<i>when you call, "Who's there?"

38
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.770
<i>I am the wind blowing through your hair

39

<i>Life's no fun without a good scare

49
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.804
<i>Skeleton Jack</i>

50
00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.057
<i>And scream like a banshee</i>
<i>Make you jump out of your skin

52

<i>Our man Jack</i>

<i>Halloween, Halloween

62
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.442
- It's over!
- We did it!

63
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.070
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!

64
00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.323
Great Halloween, everybody!

65
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:45.952
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.

66
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.956
No. Thanks to you, Jack.
Without your brilliant leadership …

67
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.960
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack!

68
00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.463
You're a witch's fondest dream!

69
00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.216
You made walls fall, Jack!

70
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.637
Walls fall? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack!

71
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.766
The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.

72
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.850
Let go!

73
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.603
You're not ready
for so much excitement.

74
00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.230
Yes, I am.

75
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.775
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!

76
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:23.198
Come back here, you foolish …

77
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.664
Jack, you make wounds ooze
and flesh crawl!

78
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.793
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much!

79
00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:39.464
Hold it! We haven't
given out the prizes yet!

80
00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.843
Our first award goes to the vampires

81
00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.804
for most blood drained
in a single evening.

82
00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.140
A second and honorable mention

83
00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:52.769
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon Leeches.

84
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.028
Nice work, Bone Daddy!

85
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:05.907
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year.

86
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.077
And the year before that,
and the year before that.

87
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.747
<i>There are few who deny</i>
<i>at what I do I am the best

88
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.918
<i>For my talents</i>
<i>are renowned far and wide

89
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:02.505
<i>When it comes to surprises</i>
<i>in the moonlit night

90
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:06.635
<i>I excel without ever even trying

91
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:11.306
<i>With the slightest little effort</i>
<i>of my ghostlike charms

92
00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.726
<i>I have seen grown men</i>
<i>give out a shriek

93
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:20.023
<i>With a wave of my hand</i>
<i>and a well-placed moan

94
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.652
<i>I have swept the very bravest</i>
<i>off their feet

95
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:29.699
<i>Yet, year after year</i>
<i>It's the same routine

96
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:34.788
<i>And I grow so weary</i>
<i>of the sound of screams

97
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:39.834
<i>And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King

98
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:45.465
<i>Have grown so tired</i>
<i>of the same old thing

99
00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:51.388
<i>Oh, somewhere deep

100
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.391
<i>Inside of these bones

101
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.560
<i>An emptiness

102
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.647
<i>Began to grow

103
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.275
<i>There's something out there

104
00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.903
<i>Far from my home

105
00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:10.240
<i>A longing that

106
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:14.411
<i>I've never known

107
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:21.126
<i>I'm the master of fright</i>
<i>and a demon of light

108
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:25.505
<i>And I'll scare you</i>
<i>right out of your pants

109
00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:29.926
<i>To a guy in Kentucky</i>
<i>I'm Mr. Unlucky

110
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.097
<i>And I'm known</i>
<i>throughout England and France

111
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.560
<i>And since I am dead</i>
<i>I can take off my head

112
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:42.897
<i>To recite Shakespearean quotations

113
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:47.527
<i>No animal nor man</i>
<i>can scream like I can

114
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.698
<i>With the fury of my recitations

115
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.534
<i>But who here

116
00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.203
<i>Would ever understand

117
00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:02.000
<i>That the Pumpkin King</i>
<i>with the skeleton grin

118
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.502
<i>Would tire of his crown?

119
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.297
<i>If they only understood

120
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.674
<i>He'd give it all up

121
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:14.387
<i>If he only could

122
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.975
<i>Oh, there's an empty place

123
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.935
<i>In my bones

124
00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:24.147
<i>That calls out for

125
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.275
<i>Something unknown

126
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:30.487
<i>The fame and praise

127
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.448
<i>Come year after year

128
00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:37.327
<i>Does nothing for

129
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.749
<i>These empty tears

130
00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.549
Jack …

131
00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.552
… I know how you feel.

132
00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.867
Sally!

133
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.955
You've come back.

134
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:26.209
- I had to.
- For this!

135
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.506
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?

136
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:46.729
That's twice this month
you've slipped deadly nightshade

137
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.524
- into my tea and run off.
- Three times.

138
00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.526
You're mine, you know.

139
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:55.947
I made you with my own hands!

140
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.741
You can make other creations.

141
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.619
I'm restless. I can't help it.

142
00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:05.415
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.

143
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.918
We need to be patient, that's all.

144
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.880
But I don't want to be patient!

145
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.759
No, Zero, not now.

146
00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.970
I'm not in the mood.

147
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.266
All right.

148
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.144
Here you go, boy.

149
00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.624
Morning, gents!

150
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.981
Jack? You home?

151
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:25.411
Jack? I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

152
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:29.499
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

153
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:33.044
Jack, please.
I'm only an elected official here.

154
00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:36.798
I can't make decisions by myself.

155
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.884
Jack, answer me!

156
00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.809
- He's not home.
- Where is he?

157
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.228
He hasn't been home all night.

158
00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:02.573
Where are we?

159
00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.623
It's someplace new.

160
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.426
What is this?

161
00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:01.984
<i>What's this? What's this?</i>
<i>There's color everywhere

162
00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.320
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>There's white things in the air

163
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.239
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>I can't believe my eyes

164
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.783
<i>I must be dreaming</i>
<i>Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair

165
00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.576
<i>What's this?

166
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.622
<i>What's this? What's this?</i>
<i>There's something very wrong

167
00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:16.958
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>There's people singing songs

168
00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:20.002
<i>What's this? The streets are lined</i>
<i>with creatures laughing

169
00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.839
<i>Everybody seems so happy</i>
<i>Have I possibly gone daffy?

170
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.633
<i>What is this? What's this?

171
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:30.221
<i>There's children throwing snowballs</i>
<i>instead of throwing heads

172
00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:33.224
<i>They're busy building toys</i>
<i>and absolutely no one's dead

173
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:36.310
<i>There's frost in every window</i>
<i>Oh, I can't believe my eyes

174
00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.354
<i>And in my bones I feel the warmth

175
00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:42.316
<i>That's coming from inside

176
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.445
<i>Oh, look, what's this?</i>
<i>They're hanging mistletoe

177
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:48.197
<i>They kiss?</i>
<i>Why, that looks so unique, inspired

178
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.450
<i>They're gathering around</i>
<i>Hearing stories

179
00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.244
<i>Roasting chestnuts on a fire</i>
<i>What's this?

180
00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.957
<i>What's this? In here</i>
<i>they've got a little tree

181
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.793
<i>How queer</i>
<i>And who would ever think, and why?

182
00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.464
<i>They're covering it with tiny things</i>
<i>Electric lights on strings

183
00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.341
<i>And there's a smile on everyone</i>
<i>Correct me if I'm wrong

184
00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:11.512
<i>This looks like fun, this looks like fun</i>
<i>Could it be I got my wish? What's this?

185
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.434
<i>Oh, my, what now?</i>
<i>The children are asleep

186
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:19.562
<i>But look, there's nothing underneath</i>
<i>No ghouls

187
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:22.231
<i>No witches to scream</i>
<i>and scare them or ensnare them

188
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:26.569
<i>Only little cozy things</i>
<i>secure inside their dreamland

189
00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:31.574
<i>What's this?

190
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.204
<i>The monsters are all missing</i>
<i>and the nightmares can't be found

191
00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:39.248
<i>And in their place there seems</i>
<i>to be good feeling all around

192
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:42.084
<i>Instead of screams</i>
<i>I swear I can hear music in the air

193
00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:47.423
<i>The smell of cakes and pies</i>
<i>are absolutely everywhere

194
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:51.469
<i>The sights, the sounds</i>
<i>They're everywhere and all around

195
00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.596
<i>I've never felt so good before

196
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.806
<i>This empty place inside of me</i>
<i>is filling up

197
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.768
<i>I simply cannot get enough</i>
<i>I want it, oh, I want it

198
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:01.521
<i>I want it for my own</i>
<i>I've got to know, I've got to know

199
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:06.234
<i>What is this place that I've found?</i>
<i>What is this?

200
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.533
Christmas Town?

201
00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.964
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.

202
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.174
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary!

203
00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:33.302
Stand aside. Coming through.

204
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.519
We've got to find Jack.

205
00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:45.898
There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!

206
00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.900
Three sixty-four.

207
00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.445
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

208
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.823
I looked in every mausoleum.

209
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.950
We opened the sarcophagi.

210
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:59.036
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.

211
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.664
I peeked behind the Cyclops' eye.

212
00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:04.500
I did, but he wasn't there.

213
00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:07.336
It's time to sound the alarms!

214
00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:39.368
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.

215
00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.377
Bitter!

216
00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.716
Worm's wart.
Where's that worm's wart?

217
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:59.221
Sally! That soup ready yet?

218
00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:03.809
Coming!

219
00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.194
Lunch!

220
00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:18.199
What's that?

221
00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.660
Worm's wart!

222
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:24.872
And frog's breath.

223
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:29.293
What's wrong?
I thought you liked frog's breath.

224
00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:33.089
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

225
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:38.135
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

226
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.429
I'm not hungry.

227
00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.642
You want me to starve.

228
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:49.563
An old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

229
00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:53.484
Me, to whom you owe your very life!

230
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.611
Don't be silly.

231
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.410
See? Scrumptious.

232
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.922
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?

233
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.966
This morning.

234
00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:22.513
- Hear that?
- What?

235
00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:25.683
Zero!

236
00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.825
Where have you been?

237
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:46.412
Call a town meeting
and I'll tell everyone all about it.

238
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.290
- When?
- Immediately!

239
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.297
Town meeting!

240
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.258
Town meeting!

241
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:02.011
Town meeting tonight!

242
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:06.307
Town meeting!

243
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.601
Town meeting tonight!

244
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.120
Listen, everyone.

245
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.876
I want to tell you about Christmas Town.

246
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:40.424
<i>There were objects so peculiar</i>
<i>They were not to be believed

247
00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:43.594
<i>All around, things to tantalize my brain

248
00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:47.515
<i>It's a world unlike anything</i>
<i>I've ever seen

249
00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:51.018
<i>And as hard as I tried</i>
<i>I can't seem to describe

250
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.396
<i>Like a most improbable dream

251
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.025
<i>But you must believe</i>
<i>when I tell you this

252
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:03.239
<i>It's as real as my skull</i>
<i>and it does exist

253
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.783
Here, let me show you.

254
00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:13.165
<i>This is a thing called a present

255
00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:16.168
<i>- The whole thing starts with a box</i>
<i>- A box?

256
00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:17.837
<i>- Is it steel?</i>
<i>- Are there locks?

257
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.423
<i>- Is it filled with a pox?</i>
<i>- How delightful, a pox

258
00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:22.716
If you please.

259
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.594
<i>Just a box with bright colored paper

260
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:28.097
<i>And the whole thing's</i>
<i>topped with a bow

261
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.183
<i>- A bow?</i>
<i>- But why? How ugly! What's in it?

262
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.269
<i>That's the point of the thing</i>
<i>Not to know

263
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:36.063
<i>- It's a bat! It's a rat!</i>
<i>- Will it bend? Will it break?

264
00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.732
<i>Perhaps it's the head</i>
<i>I found in the lake

265
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:41.402
<i>Listen now</i>
<i>You don't understand

266
00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:44.989
<i>That's not the point</i>
<i>of Christmas land

267
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:49.118
Now, pay attention.
<i>We pick up an oversized sock

268
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:51.620
<i>And hang it like this on the wall

269
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.999
<i>- Oh, yes, does it still have a foot?</i>
<i>- Let me see, let me look

270
00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:58.544
<i>- Is it rotted and covered with gook?</i>
- Let me explain.

271
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:03.674
<i>There's no foot inside, but candy</i>
<i>Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

272
00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:06.635
<i>- Small toys? Do they snap?</i>
<i>- Or explode in the sack?

273
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:09.471
<i>Perhaps they spring out</i>
<i>and scare girls and boys

274
00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:12.016
<i>What a splendid idea</i>
<i>This Christmas sounds fun

275
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.727
<i>I fully endorse it</i>
<i>Let's try it at once

276
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.271
<i>Everyone, please</i>
<i>Now, not so fast

277
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:20.608
<i>There's something here</i>
<i>that you don't quite grasp

278
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.363
Well, I may as well give them
what they want.

279
00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:29.992
<i>And the best I must confess</i>
<i>I have saved for the last

280
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:33.412
<i>For the ruler of this Christmas land

281
00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:37.082
<i>Is a fearsome king</i>
<i>with a deep mighty voice

282
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:40.419
<i>Least that's what</i>
<i>I've come to understand

283
00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:44.006
<i>And I've also heard it told</i>
<i>that he's something to behold

284
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:47.468
<i>Like a lobster, huge and red

285
00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:51.055
<i>When he sets out to sleigh</i>
<i>with his rain gear on

286
00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:54.683
<i>Carting bulging sacks</i>
<i>with his big great arms

287
00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:58.062
<i>That is so, I've heard it said

288
00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:01.607
<i>And on a dark cold night</i>
<i>under full moonlight

289
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:06.779
<i>He flies into a fog</i>
<i>like a vulture in the sky

290
00:24:07.488 --> 00:24:10.824
<i>And they call him

291
00:24:10.908 --> 00:24:14.536
<i>Sandy Claws

292
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:24.964
<i>Well, at least they're excited</i>
<i>But they don't understand

293
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:27.508
<i>That special kind of feeling

294
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:30.177
<i>In Christmas land

295
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.930
Oh, well.

296
00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:10.134
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

297
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:27.026
You've poisoned me for the last time,
you wretched girl!

298
00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:38.996
Oh, my head!

299
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.877
The door is open!

300
00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:48.922
- Hello?
- Jack Skellington!

301
00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:51.425
Up here, my boy!

302
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:54.636
Doctor, I need
to borrow some equipment.

303
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.390
Is that so? Whatever for?

304
00:25:58.474 --> 00:26:01.935
I'm conducting a series of experiments.

305
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:04.980
How perfectly marvelous!

306
00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:09.485
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.

307
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:13.739
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

308
00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:16.533
Experiments?

309
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.122
Zero! I'm home!

310
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:31.066
Interesting reaction,
but what does it mean?

311
00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:14.962
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

312
00:29:15.504 --> 00:29:17.256
Sally?

313
00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:20.550
Sally!

314
00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:23.762
Gone again!

315
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:55.604
<i>Something's up with Jack</i>
<i>Something's up with Jack

316
00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:00.776
<i>Don't know if we're ever</i>
<i>going to get him back

317
00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:05.572
<i>He's all alone up there</i>
<i>Locked away inside

318
00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:11.078
<i>- Never says a word</i>
<i>- Hope he hasn't died

319
00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:14.289
<i>Something's up with Jack</i>
<i>Something's up with Jack

320
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:25.258
<i>Christmas time is buzzing in my skull

321
00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:28.470
<i>Will it let me be?</i>
<i>I cannot tell

322
00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:31.765
<i>There're so many things I cannot grasp

323
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.810
<i>When I think I've got it</i>
<i>Then at last

324
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.979
<i>Through my bony fingers it does slip

325
00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:40.190
<i>Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

326
00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:44.152
<i>Something here I'm not quite getting</i>
<i>Though I try, I keep forgetting

327
00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:47.989
<i>Like a memory long since past

328
00:31:48.073 --> 00:31:52.577
<i>Here in an instant, gone in a flash</i>
<i>What does it mean? What does it mean?

329
00:31:53.495 --> 00:31:56.873
<i>In these little bric-a-brac</i>
<i>A secret's waiting to be cracked

330
00:31:56.957 --> 00:32:01.378
<i>These dolls and toys confuse me so</i>
<i>Confound it all, I love it though

331
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:05.173
<i>Simple objects, nothing more</i>
<i>But something's hidden through a door

332
00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:08.885
<i>Though I do not have the key

333
00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:13.265
<i>Something's here I cannot see</i>
<i>What does it mean? What does it mean?

334
00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:16.351
<i>What does it mean?

335
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.359
<i>I've read these Christmas books</i>
<i>so many times

336
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:27.654
<i>I know the stories</i>
<i>and I know the rhymes

337
00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:30.532
<i>I know the Christmas carols all by heart

338
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.869
<i>My skull's so full</i>
<i>It's tearing me apart

339
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:37.038
<i>As often as I've read them</i>
<i>Something's wrong

340
00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:40.167
<i>So hard to put my bony finger on

341
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.587
<i>Or perhaps it's really not as deep</i>
<i>as I've been led to think

342
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.090
<i>Am I trying much too hard?

343
00:32:47.174 --> 00:32:50.886
<i>Of course, I've been too close to see</i>
<i>The answer's right in front of me

344
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:54.306
<i>Right in front of me</i>
<i>It's simple, really, very clear

345
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:56.183
<i>Like music drifting in the air

346
00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:59.644
<i>Invisible, but everywhere

347
00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:03.690
<i>Just because I cannot see it</i>
<i>doesn't mean I can't believe it

348
00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:07.861
<i>You know, I think this Christmas thing</i>
<i>is not as tricky as it seems

349
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:11.448
<i>And why should they have all the fun?</i>
<i>It should belong to anyone

350
00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:15.118
<i>Not anyone, in fact, but me</i>
<i>Why, I could make a Christmas tree

351
00:33:15.202 --> 00:33:18.747
<i>And there's no reason I can find</i>
<i>I couldn't handle Christmas time

352
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:24.294
<i>I bet I could improve it, too</i>
<i>and that's exactly what I'll do

353
00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:28.590
Eureka!

354
00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:33.470
This year, Christmas will be ours!

355
00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:39.726
Patience, everyone.

356
00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:43.480
Jack has a special job for each of you.

357
00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:47.734
Dr. Finkelstein!

358
00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:51.571
Your Christmas assignment is ready.

359
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.161
Dr. Finkelstein
to the front of the line!

360
00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:05.585
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

361
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:08.463
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!

362
00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:10.173
I knew it!

363
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:13.260
Doctor, thank you for coming.

364
00:34:13.343 --> 00:34:16.054
We need some of these.

365
00:34:18.807 --> 00:34:22.602
Their construction should be
exceedingly simple, I think.

366
00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:25.730
How horrible our Christmas will be.

367
00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:28.817
No. How jolly!

368
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.988
Oh, how jolly our Christmas will be.

369
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.660
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.

370
00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.745
- Specifically.
- By name.

371
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:41.997
- Lock.
- Shock.

372
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.665
Barrel.

373
00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:48.587
Jack. Jack!
It's Boogie's boys.

374
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.132
Halloween's finest trick-or-treaters!

375
00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:55.677
The job I have for you is top secret.

376
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.763
It requires craft, cunning, mischief.

377
00:34:58.847 --> 00:35:02.183
And we thought you
didn't like us, Jack!

378
00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:07.188
Absolutely no one is to know about it.
Not a soul.

379
00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:09.691
Now, you must go to the forest.

380
00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:12.485
In the forest you will see a tree.

381
00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:16.364
… Christmas Town.

382
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:23.204
And one more thing.

383
00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:27.083
Leave that no account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

384
00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:28.793
Whatever you say, Jack.

385
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:31.546
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

386
00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:53.777
<i>Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws?

387
00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:57.447
<i>- I wanna do it</i>
<i>- Let's draw straws

388
00:35:58.281 --> 00:36:00.992
<i>- Jack said we should work together</i>
<i>- Three of a kind

389
00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:03.912
<i>- Birds of a feather</i>
<i>- Now and for ever

390
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:13.004
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws</i>
<i>Lock him up real tight

391
00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:16.633
<i>Throw away the key</i>
<i>and then turn off all the lights

392
00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:20.220
<i>First we're going to set some bait</i>
<i>inside a nasty trap and wait

393
00:36:20.303 --> 00:36:23.765
<i>When he comes a-sniffing, we will</i>
<i>snap the trap and close the gate

394
00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:27.185
<i>Wait, I've got a better plan</i>
<i>to catch this big red lobster man

395
00:36:27.268 --> 00:36:30.397
<i>Pop him in a boiling pot</i>
<i>and when he's done, we'll butter him up

396
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.234
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws</i>
<i>Throw him in a box

397
00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:37.862
<i>Bury him for 90 years</i>
<i>Then see if he talks

398
00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:42.075
<i>Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man

399
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:45.245
<i>Can take the whole thing over then

400
00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:48.790
<i>He'll be so pleased, I do declare

401
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:52.168
<i>That he will cook him rare

402
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:02.220
<i>I say that we take a cannon</i>
<i>Aim it at his door and then

403
00:37:02.303 --> 00:37:06.057
<i>Knock three times, and when he answers</i>
<i>Sandy Claws will be no more

404
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:09.310
<i>You're so stupid, think now</i>
<i>If we blow him up to smithereens

405
00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:12.939
<i>We may lose some pieces and then</i>
<i>Jack will beat us black and green

406
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:16.192
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws</i>
<i>Tie him in a bag

407
00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:19.404
<i>Throw him in the ocean</i>
<i>Then see if he is sad

408
00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:22.991
<i>Because Mr. Oogie Boogie</i>
<i>is the meanest guy around

409
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:28.329
<i>If I were on his boogie list</i>
<i>I'd get out of town

410
00:37:29.956 --> 00:37:32.459
<i>He'll be so pleased by our success

411
00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:36.296
<i>That he'll reward us, too, I'll bet

412
00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:39.257
<i>Perhaps he'll make his special brew

413
00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:42.302
<i>Of snake and spider stew

414
00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:46.014
<i>We're his little henchmen</i>
<i>and we take our job with pride

415
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:49.350
<i>We do our best to please him</i>
<i>and stay on his good side

416
00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:51.227
<i>I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

417
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:53.104
<i>- I'm not the dumb one</i>
<i>- You're no fun

418
00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:54.189
- Shut up!
- Make me.

419
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:57.400
<i>I've got something, listen</i>
<i>This one is real good, you'll see

420
00:37:57.484 --> 00:38:01.112
<i>We'll send a present to his door</i>
<i>Upon there'll be a note to read

421
00:38:01.196 --> 00:38:04.365
<i>Now in the box we'll wait and hide</i>
<i>until his curiosity

422
00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:07.744
<i>Entices him to look inside</i>
<i>and then we'll have him one, two, three

423
00:38:07.827 --> 00:38:11.539
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws</i>
<i>Beat him with a stick

424
00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:14.751
<i>Lock him up for 90 years</i>
<i>See what makes him tick

425
00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:18.463
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws</i>
<i>Chop him into bits

426
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:22.008
<i>Mr. Oogie Boogie</i>
<i>is sure to get his kicks

427
00:38:22.091 --> 00:38:25.678
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws</i>
<i>See what we will see

428
00:38:25.762 --> 00:38:30.475
<i>Lock him in a cage</i>
<i>and then throw away the key

429
00:38:35.688 --> 00:38:38.900
Sandy Claws, huh?

430
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.743
It goes something like this.

431
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:55.500
How about it?
Think you can you manage?

432
00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.920
A-one and a-two and a-three and …

433
00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:08.888
- Next!
- Fantastic!

434
00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:12.892
Now, why don't you all practice on that
and we'll be in great shape!

435
00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:16.271
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

436
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:19.691
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

437
00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:23.111
- That's splendid!
- No. It was about your Christmas.

438
00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:27.407
- There was smoke and fire!
- That's not my Christmas.

439
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:31.160
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy,

440
00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:33.079
and this!

441
00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:36.916
My Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.

442
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.503
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster!

443
00:39:40.587 --> 00:39:43.673
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.

444
00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:46.050
This part's red. The trim is white.

445
00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:49.262
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.

446
00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:52.515
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

447
00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:56.477
- Next!
- I have every confidence in you.

448
00:39:56.561 --> 00:40:00.273
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.

449
00:40:01.024 --> 00:40:03.943
This device is called a nutcracker.

450
00:40:04.027 --> 00:40:07.906
- Jack! We caught him! We got him!
- Perfect!

451
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:10.116
Open it up! Quickly!

452
00:40:13.328 --> 00:40:15.496
That's not Sandy Claws.

453
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.081
- It isn't?
- Who is it?

454
00:40:20.627 --> 00:40:22.378
Bunny!

455
00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:28.468
- Not Sandy Claws. Take him back!
- We followed your instructions.

456
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:32.972
- We went through the door.
- Which door? There's more than one.

457
00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:37.185
Sandy Claws is behind the door
shaped like this.

458
00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.354
I told you!

459
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:49.364
I'm very sorry
for the inconvenience, sir.

460
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:53.409
Take him home first.
And apologize again!

461
00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:57.497
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him! Treat him nicely!

462
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.167
- Got it!
- We'll get it right next time!

463
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.046
You will be a decided improvement

464
00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.590
over that treacherous Sally.

465
00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:09.968
Master!

466
00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:12.428
The plans.

467
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:18.893
Excellent, Igor.

468
00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:34.951
<i>This time

469
00:41:36.953 --> 00:41:38.788
<i>This time

470
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:41.416
<i>Making Christmas

471
00:41:42.583 --> 00:41:44.335
<i>Making Christmas

472
00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:50.299
<i>Making Christmas</i>
<i>Making Christmas is so fine

473
00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:55.430
<i>It's ours this time</i>
<i>and won't the children be surprised?

474
00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:58.516
<i>It's ours this time

475
00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:01.936
<i>- Making Christmas</i>
<i>- Making Christmas

476
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:06.607
<i>- Making Christmas</i>
<i>- Time to give them something fun

477
00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:10.069
<i>They'll talk about for years to come

478
00:42:10.153 --> 00:42:13.656
<i>Let's have a cheer from everyone

479
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.783
<i>It's time to party

480
00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:20.204
<i>Making Christmas</i>
<i>Making Christmas

481
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:24.167
<i>Sticks and mice get wrapped up so nice

482
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:27.628
<i>With spider legs and pretty bows

483
00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:30.465
<i>It's ours this time

484
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:33.801
<i>All together, that and this

485
00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:38.848
<i>With all our tricks</i>
<i>We're making Christmas time

486
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:40.183
Here comes Jack!

487
00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:43.936
<i>I don't believe

488
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.523
<i>What's happening to me

489
00:42:47.607 --> 00:42:51.486
<i>My hopes, my dreams

490
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:54.989
<i>My fantasies

491
00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:03.956
<i>Won't they be impressed?</i>
<i>I am a genius

492
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.502
<i>See how I transformed this old rat

493
00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:11.881
<i>Into a most delightful hat

494
00:43:12.965 --> 00:43:16.511
<i>My compliments from me to you</i>
<i>on this your most intriguing hat

495
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:20.223
<i>Consider though this substitute</i>
<i>A bat in place of this old rat

496
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:23.392
<i>No, no, that's all wrong</i>
<i>This thing will never make a present

497
00:43:23.476 --> 00:43:26.187
<i>It's been dead for too long</i>
<i>Try something fresher

498
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.898
<i>Something pleasant</i>
<i>Try again, don't give up

499
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:31.651
<i>All together, that and this

500
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:36.447
<i>With all our tricks</i>
<i>We're making Christmas time

501
00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:48.978
<i>This time, this time

502
00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:53.608
<i>Making Christmas</i>
<i>Making Christmas

503
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:56.986
<i>It's almost here</i>
<i>and we can't wait

504
00:44:57.069 --> 00:45:00.448
<i>So ring the bells and celebrate

505
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:03.951
<i>'Cause when the full moon</i>
<i>starts to climb

506
00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:09.290
<i>We'll all sing out</i>
<i>"It's Christmas time!"

507
00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:23.387
Kathleen. Bobby. Susie.

508
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:26.265
Yes, Susie's been nice. Nice. Nice.

509
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:29.477
Naughty. Nice. Nice. Nice.

510
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.022
There are hardly
any naughty children this year.

511
00:45:33.105 --> 00:45:35.024
Now, who could that be?

512
00:45:37.902 --> 00:45:39.737
Trick or treat!

513
00:45:44.283 --> 00:45:47.828
You don't look like yourself, Jack.
Not at all!

514
00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:50.957
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!

515
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.459
But you're the Pumpkin King.

516
00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:58.047
Not anymore!
I feel so much better now!

517
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.093
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but …

518
00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:04.011
Sorry.

519
00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:06.806
You're right. Something is missing.

520
00:46:06.889 --> 00:46:10.935
But what?
I've got the beard, the coat,

521
00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:12.561
the boots, the belt …

522
00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:17.191
- Jack! This time we bagged him!
- This time we really did!

523
00:46:17.275 --> 00:46:20.319
- He sure is big, Jack.
- And heavy!

524
00:46:20.403 --> 00:46:21.946
Let me out!

525
00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:26.033
Sandy Claws. In person.

526
00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:27.910
What a pleasure to meet you!

527
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:33.666
Why, you have hands.
You don't have claws at all!

528
00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:38.546
- Where am I?
- Surprised, aren't you?

529
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.131
I knew you would be.

530
00:46:40.214 --> 00:46:43.759
You don't need to have another worry
about Christmas this year.

531
00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:46.929
- What?
- Consider this a vacation, Sandy.

532
00:46:47.013 --> 00:46:49.724
A reward.
It's your turn to take it easy.

533
00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:53.561
- But there must be some mistake.
- See that he's comfortable.

534
00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:57.315
Just a second, fellas. Of course!

535
00:46:57.398 --> 00:47:00.067
- That's what I'm missing. Thanks.
- But …

536
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:01.736
You just can't …

537
00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:04.363
Hold on! Where are we going now?

538
00:47:04.447 --> 00:47:07.033
Oh, ho, ho! No …

539
00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:11.203
This is worse than I thought.
Much worse.

540
00:47:11.287 --> 00:47:13.289
I know!

541
00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:16.459
Me on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?!

542
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:20.421
- Where are we taking him?
- To Oogie Boogie, of course.

543
00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:23.591
There isn't anywhere
more comfortable than that.

544
00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:28.220
- Jack said to make him comfortable.
- Yes, he did.

545
00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:32.683
Haven't you heard of peace on earth
and goodwill toward men?

546
00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:34.435
No!

547
00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:44.862
This will stop Jack!

548
00:47:56.123 --> 00:48:00.961
What a joy to think
of all we'll have in common!

549
00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:03.756
We'll have conversations

550
00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:06.717
worth having!

551
00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.973
Don't do this!

552
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:15.726
Naughty children never get any presents.

553
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.270
I think he might be too big!

554
00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:20.314
No, he's not.

555
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:25.736
If he can go down a chimney,
he can fit down here!

556
00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:57.560
<i>Well, well, well</i>
<i>What have we here?

557
00:48:57.643 --> 00:49:02.356
<i>Sandy Claws, huh?</i>
<i>I'm really scared

558
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.569
<i>So you're the one</i>
<i>everybody's talkin' about

559
00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:10.823
<i>You're jokin', you're jokin'</i>
<i>I can't believe my eyes

560
00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:15.244
<i>You're jokin' me, you gotta be</i>
<i>This can't be the right guy

561
00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:19.665
<i>He's ancient, he's ugly</i>
<i>I don't know which is worse

562
00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:24.170
<i>I might just split a seam now</i>
<i>if I don't die laughin' first

563
00:49:24.253 --> 00:49:28.466
<i>Mr. Oogie Boogie says</i>
<i>There's trouble close at hand

564
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:32.678
<i>You'd better pay attention now</i>
<i>'cause I'm the Boogie Man

565
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:37.266
<i>And if you aren't shakin'</i>
<i>There's somethin' very wrong

566
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:41.228
<i>'Cause this may be the last time</i>
<i>You hear the Boogie song

567
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.488
<i>I'm the Oogie Boogie Man

568
00:49:50.571 --> 00:49:55.075
<i>Release me now or you must face</i>
<i>the dire consequences

569
00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:59.538
<i>The children are expecting me</i>
<i>So please come to your senses

570
00:49:59.622 --> 00:50:03.751
<i>You're jokin', you're jokin'</i>
<i>I can't believe my ears

571
00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:08.088
<i>Would someone shut this fella up?</i>
<i>I'm drownin' in my tears

572
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:12.593
<i>It's funny, I'm laughin'</i>
<i>You really are too much

573
00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:17.264
<i>And now, with your permission</i>
<i>I'm going to do my stuff

574
00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:20.476
- What are you going to do?
- The best I can.

575
00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:26.565
<i>The sound of rollin' dice to me</i>
<i>is music in the air

576
00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:30.945
<i>'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man</i>
<i>Although I don't play fair

577
00:50:31.028 --> 00:50:35.574
<i>It's much more fun, I must confess</i>
<i>when lives are on the line

578
00:50:35.658 --> 00:50:40.162
<i>Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy</i>
<i>Now, that'd be just fine

579
00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:44.667
<i>Release me fast or you will have</i>
<i>to answer for this heinous act

580
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.629
<i>Oh, brother, you're something</i>
<i>You put me in a spin

581
00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:52.967
<i>You aren't comprehending</i>
<i>the position that you're in

582
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.429
<i>It's hopeless, you're finished</i>
<i>You haven't got a prayer

583
00:50:57.513 --> 00:50:59.807
<i>'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie

584
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.644
<i>And you ain't goin' nowhere

585
00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:45.144
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky,

586
00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:48.188
outshining every star,

587
00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:52.318
your silhouette
a dark blot on the moon.

588
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:54.778
You, who are our pride,

589
00:51:54.862 --> 00:51:57.197
you, who are our glory,

590
00:51:57.281 --> 00:52:01.952
you, who have frightened millions
into an early grave.

591
00:52:02.036 --> 00:52:04.496
You, who have …

592
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.375
… devastated the souls
of the … living!

593
00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:12.212
Oh, no. We can't take off in this.

594
00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:15.215
The reindeer can't see an inch
in front of their noses.

595
00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:19.094
This fog's as thick as …

596
00:52:19.178 --> 00:52:22.056
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!

597
00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:25.434
There go all of my hopes,

598
00:52:25.517 --> 00:52:27.645
my precious plans,

599
00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:29.438
my glorious dreams.

600
00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:33.025
There goes Christmas.

601
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:38.072
No, Zero. Down, boy.

602
00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:42.076
My, what a brilliant nose you have.

603
00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:44.536
The better to light my way!

604
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.914
To the head of the team, Zero.

605
00:52:48.874 --> 00:52:50.668
We're off!

606
00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.048
Wait, Jack. No!

607
00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:19.571
Goodbye, Jack.

608
00:53:19.655 --> 00:53:22.491
My dearest Jack.

609
00:53:22.574 --> 00:53:26.328
Oh, how I hope my premonition is wrong.

610
00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:36.880
<i>I sense there's something in the wind

611
00:53:36.964 --> 00:53:42.302
<i>That feels like tragedy's at hand

612
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:47.474
<i>And though I'd like to stand by him

613
00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:52.479
<i>Can't shake this feeling that I have

614
00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:58.277
<i>The worst is just around the bend

615
00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.489
<i>And does he notice

616
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:06.326
<i>My feelings for him?

617
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.122
<i>And will he see

618
00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:14.460
<i>How much he means to me?

619
00:54:14.543 --> 00:54:19.423
<i>I think it's not to be

620
00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:25.179
<i>What will become</i>
<i>of my dear friend?

621
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:29.975
<i>Where will his actions lead us then?

622
00:54:30.058 --> 00:54:35.647
<i>Although I'd like to join the crowd

623
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:41.028
<i>In their enthusiastic cloud

624
00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:46.033
<i>Try as I may, it doesn't last

625
00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:50.954
<i>And will we ever

626
00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:55.167
<i>End up together?

627
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:58.378
<i>No, I think not

628
00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:02.633
<i>It's never to become

629
00:55:02.716 --> 00:55:07.763
<i>For I am not the one

630
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:42.256
Santa!

631
00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:04.444
Santa?

632
00:56:05.445 --> 00:56:06.905
Merry Christmas!

633
00:56:06.989 --> 00:56:09.616
And what is your name?

634
00:56:11.118 --> 00:56:15.581
That's all right. I have
a special present for you anyway.

635
00:56:15.664 --> 00:56:17.749
There you go, sonny.

636
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.303
And what did Santa bring you, honey?

637
00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:34.892
Merry Christmas!

638
00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:38.729
Hello. Police.

639
00:56:39.688 --> 00:56:42.316
Attacked by Christmas toys?
That's strange.

640
00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:44.610
That's the second
toy complaint we've had.

641
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.073
Mom! Dad! Help!

642
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:11.613
You're welcome, one and all!

643
00:58:11.697 --> 00:58:13.865
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.

644
00:58:13.949 --> 00:58:16.076
Police. I know. A skeleton.

645
00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:20.330
Keep calm. Turn off the lights. Make
sure doors are locked. Hello. Police.

646
00:58:20.414 --> 00:58:22.874
Reports are pouring in
from all over the globe

647
00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:26.211
<i>that an impostor is shamelessly</i>
<i>impersonating Santa Claus,

648
00:58:26.294 --> 00:58:30.215
<i>mocking and mangling</i>
<i>this joyous holiday.

649
00:58:30.298 --> 00:58:34.136
<i>Authorities assure us that, at this</i>
<i>moment, military units are mobilizing

650
00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:37.180
<i>to stop the perpetrator</i>

651
00:58:37.264 --> 00:58:40.267
Jack. Someone has to help Jack!

652
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:44.396
- Where did they take that Sandy Claws?
<i>- … come back and save Christmas.

653
00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:57.784
Look, Zero. Searchlights.

654
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:07.461
They're celebrating!

655
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:11.381
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job!

656
00:59:11.465 --> 00:59:16.470
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!

657
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:20.348
It's OK, Zero. Head higher!

658
00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:27.481
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?

659
00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:29.357
Let's play!

660
00:59:32.444 --> 00:59:34.404
My, my!

661
00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:37.324
What have we here?

662
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:48.919
I'll get you out of here.

663
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:53.173
Lovely!

664
00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:56.676
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

665
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.102
What?! You try
to make a dupe out of me?!

666
01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.366
Who's next on my list?

667
01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:23.912
Little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?

668
01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:39.761
They're trying to hit us! Zero!

669
01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.357
Merry Christmas to all,

670
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.027
and to all a good night!

671
01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:20.218
I knew this Christmas thing
was a bad idea.

672
01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:23.221
I felt it in my gut.

673
01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.933
Terrible news, folks!

674
01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:31.062
The worst tragedy of our times!

675
01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:35.400
Jack has been blown to smithereens!

676
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:40.822
Terrible, terrible news!

677
01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:47.829
Attention. Attention, citizens.
Terrible news.

678
01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:51.666
There's still no sign of Santa Claus.

679
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.461
Although the impostor
has been shot down,

680
01:01:54.544 --> 01:02:00.342
it looks like Christmas will have
to be canceled this year.

681
01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:04.471
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,

682
01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:08.600
but there's still no sign
of the real Santa.

683
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:23.823
<i>What have I done?

684
01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:27.577
<i>What have I done?

685
01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:30.497
<i>How could I

686
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.167
<i>Be so blind?

687
01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.337
<i>All is lost

688
01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.840
<i>Where was I?

689
01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.301
<i>Spoiled all

690
01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:47.681
<i>Spoiled all

691
01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:51.142
<i>Everything's

692
01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:54.521
<i>Gone all wrong

693
01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:57.857
<i>What have I done?

694
01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.236
<i>What have I done?

695
01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:05.573
<i>Find a deep cave to hide in

696
01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:10.662
<i>In a million years they'll find me

697
01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:13.873
<i>Only dust

698
01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:18.461
<i>And a plaque that reads

699
01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:23.675
<i>"Here lies poor old Jack"

700
01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:27.887
<i>But I never intended

701
01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:31.266
<i>All this madness, never

702
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:35.854
<i>And nobody really understood

703
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.981
<i>Well, how could they?

704
01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:42.485
<i>That all I ever wanted</i>
<i>was to bring them something great

705
01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:46.281
<i>Why does nothing</i>
<i>ever turn out like it should?

706
01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.284
<i>Well, what the heck?

707
01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:51.745
<i>I went and did my best

708
01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:55.999
<i>And, by God</i>
<i>I really tasted something swell

709
01:03:56.082 --> 01:04:01.379
<i>And for a moment</i>
<i>Why, I even touched the sky

710
01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:05.550
<i>And at least I left some stories</i>
<i>they can tell, I did

711
01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:10.180
<i>And for the first time</i>
<i>since I don't remember when

712
01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:14.267
<i>I felt just like</i>
<i>my old bony self again

713
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:18.730
<i>And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King

714
01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:24.110
<i>That's right</i>
<i>I am the Pumpkin King

715
01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:28.073
<i>And I just can't wait</i>
<i>until next Halloween

716
01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:32.327
<i>'Cause I've got some new ideas</i>
<i>that will really make them scream

717
01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:37.040
<i>And, by God I'm really going</i>
<i>to give it all my might

718
01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:44.172
<i>I hope there's still time</i>
<i>to set things right

719
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.133
Sandy Claws!

720
01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.637
You wait till Jack hears about this.

721
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.057
By the time he's through with you,
you'll be lucky …

722
01:04:54.140 --> 01:05:00.063
The King of Halloween
has been blown to smithereens!

723
01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:05.068
Skeleton Jack is now a pile of dust!

724
01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:08.655
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.

725
01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:21.042
What's that you were sayin'
about luck, rag doll?

726
01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:29.050
Help! Help!

727
01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:34.305
Seven!

728
01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:37.434
It's Oogie's turn to boogie now.

729
01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:42.939
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven!

730
01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.152
This can't be happening!

731
01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:51.114
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

732
01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:55.910
Oh, I'm feeling weak … with hunger!

733
01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:59.706
One more roll of the dice
oughta do it!

734
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.961
What? Snake eyes?!

735
01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.965
Eleven!

736
01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:12.844
Looks like I won the jackpot!

737
01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:16.097
Bye-bye, doll face

738
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:18.433
and sandman!

739
01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.562
What the …?

740
01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:26.774
Hello, Oogie.

741
01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:29.694
Jack! But they said you were dead.

742
01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:32.906
You must be double dead!

743
01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:44.584
Well, come on, bone man!

744
01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:01.601
Fire!

745
01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.156
Jack, look out!

746
01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:23.456
So long, Jack!

747
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:30.255
How dare you treat my friends
so shamefully!

748
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:38.638
Now look what you've done!

749
01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:42.725
My bugs! My bugs!

750
01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:46.104
My bugs! My bugs!

751
01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.240
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.

752
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.993
I'm afraid I've made
a terrible mess of your holiday.

753
01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.495
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

754
01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:06.958
The next time you get the urge
to take over someone else's holiday,

755
01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:09.294
I'd listen to her. She's the only one

756
01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:12.297
who makes any sense
around this insane asylum!

757
01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.675
- Skeletons and boogie men!
- I hope there's still time.

758
01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.760
To fix Christmas?

759
01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:22.307
Of course there is. I'm Santa Claus!

760
01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:30.607
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.

761
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:32.859
How did you get down here, Sally?

762
01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:36.446
I … I was trying to …
Well, I wanted to …

763
01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.698
- To …
- To help me?

764
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:41.200
- I couldn't let you just …
- Sally …

765
01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:44.037
I can't believe.
I never realized that you …

766
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.497
- Jack! Jack!
- Here he is!

767
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.875
- Alive!
- Just like we said!

768
01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:51.085
Grab a hold, my boy!

769
01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:59.177
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one
and only, has finally been spotted.

770
01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.513
<i>Old Saint Nick appears to be</i>
<i>traveling at supersonic speed.

771
01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:06.851
<i>He's setting things right, bringing</i>
<i>joy and cheer wherever he goes.

772
01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:09.896
<i>Yes, folks, Kris Kringle has</i>
<i>pulled it out of the bag

773
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:14.609
<i>and delivered Christmas</i>
<i>to excited children all over the world.

774
01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:22.825
- Jack!
- Jack's back!

775
01:09:22.909 --> 01:09:24.786
- Jack?
- Jack's OK!

776
01:09:24.869 --> 01:09:26.621
- He's all right!
- It's Jack!

777
01:09:26.704 --> 01:09:28.414
<i>Jack's OK

778
01:09:28.498 --> 01:09:30.917
<i>And he's back</i>
<i>OK

779
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.419
<i>He's all right</i>
<i>Let's shout

780
01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:35.505
<i>Make a fuss</i>
<i>Scream it out

781
01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:39.509
<i>Jack is back</i>
<i>Now, everyone sing

782
01:09:39.592 --> 01:09:42.845
<i>In our town of Halloween

783
01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.598
It's great to be home!

784
01:09:48.226 --> 01:09:51.187
Happy Halloween!

785
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.314
Merry Christmas!

786
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.651
<i>- What's this?</i>
<i>- What's this?

787
01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:58.152
<i>I haven't got a clue

788
01:09:58.236 --> 01:10:00.363
<i>- What's this?</i>
<i>- Why, it's completely new

789
01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.532
<i>- What's this?</i>
<i>- Must be a Christmas thing

790
01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:05.618
<i>- What's this?</i>
<i>- It's really very strange

791
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:16.254
<i>This is Halloween, Halloween</i>
<i>Halloween, Halloween

792
01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.172
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>What's this?

793
01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:26.514
Careful, my precious jewel.

794
01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:54.834
My dearest friend.

795
01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.837
<i>If you don't mind

796
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.048
<i>I'd like to join you

797
01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:04.177
<i>By your side

798
01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.763
<i>Where we can gaze

799
01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:10.433
<i>Into the stars

800
01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:15.104
<i>And sit together

801
01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:19.233
<i>Now and forever

802
01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:22.945
<i>For it is plain

803
01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:27.200
<i>As anyone can see

804
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:32.538
<i>We're simply meant to be
