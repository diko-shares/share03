1
00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:15.331
Pull yourself together Teddy!

2
00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:16.916
Pull yourself together!

3
00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:23.757
It's just water.

4
00:01:25.717 --> 00:01:27.635
It's a lot of water.

5
00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:34.851
Come on.

6
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.505
- You okay boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't

7
00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:07.092
I just can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:12.931
- So you're my new partner?
- That's right.

9
00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:16.309
Not the best way to meet with my head
halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.105
Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels:
The man. The legend. I'll give you that.

11
00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.189
The Legend?

12
00:02:22.148 --> 00:02:24.401
What the hell are you boys smoking
out there in Portland anyway?

13
00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:25.110
Seattle.

14
00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:29.322
I came from the office in Seattle.

15
00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:32.575
How long have you been with Marshals?

16
00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:33.618
Four years.

17
00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:38.665
- So you know how small it is?
- Sure

18
00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:44.170
What about you? You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:45.422
I was.

20
00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:58.685
She died.

21
00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:03.773
- Jesus... I didn't...
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:07.736
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work

23
00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.320
Four People died.

24
00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:12.949
It was the smoke that got her
not the fire. So...

25
00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.368
- So that's important.
- I'm sorry Boss.

26
00:03:15.368 --> 00:03:17.996
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:19.622 --> 00:03:20.874
Well here. Have one of mine.

28
00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:24.335
I could of sworn they were in my jacket
when I got on.

29
00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:27.505
Government employees will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29.424 --> 00:03:30.008
Thanks.

31
00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:34.262
They give you a briefing
about the institution before you left?

32
00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:37.766
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:40.685
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:41.227 --> 00:03:43.396
Well, if it was just folks running around,
hearing voices,

35
00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:48.485
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.329
- That's where we're headed?
- Yup.

37
00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:01.873
The other side of the island is rock bluffs

38
00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:03.917
all the way down to the edge
of the water.

39
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:08.254
The dock, it's the
only way on...or off.

40
00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:12.008
We will be casting off as soon as
you two are ashore.

41
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:14.594
I'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:16.888
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:47.585
I've never seen a marshal's
badge before.

44
00:04:48.628 --> 00:04:50.171
I'm Deputy Warden
McPherson, gentlemen.

45
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:56.094
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.

46
00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.774
Your boys seem a little on edge
Mr. McPherson.

47
00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:12.610
Right now, Marshal. We all are.

48
00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:34.674
"Remember us for we too have
lived, loved and laughed"

49
00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:58.073
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:01.326
How could you tell?

51
00:06:02.577 --> 00:06:05.872
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:37.112
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give.

53
00:06:37.112 --> 00:06:41.866
But during the stay you will
obey protocol. Is that understood?

54
00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:42.867
Absolutely.

55
00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:47.205
The red brick bulding on my right
is ward A, the male ward.

56
00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:50.208
Ward B, the female ward, is the one
on the left.

57
00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:53.712
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.
An old civil war fort.

58
00:06:55.422 --> 00:06:57.841
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

59
00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:02.137
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without
the written consent and

60
00:07:02.137 --> 00:07:05.015
physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly.

61
00:07:05.015 --> 00:07:06.808
Is that understood?

62
00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:11.021
You act like insanity is catching.

63
00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:18.028
You are hereby required to surrending
your firearms.

64
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:21.573
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

65
00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:24.075
We are required to carry our
firearms with us at all times.

66
00:07:24.075 --> 00:07:27.120
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of
Penitentiaries states that:

67
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.289
when inside the penitentiary

68
00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:34.461
the offices of that institution
have final authority.

69
00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:42.802
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

70
00:07:58.777 --> 00:08:02.322
Okay. Now that the official stuff is done,
come on boys.

71
00:08:02.322 --> 00:08:05.951
What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

72
00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:19.214
So when did she escape? This prisoner?

73
00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:22.342
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation.

74
00:08:22.342 --> 00:08:23.176
Protocol.

75
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.762
Correctional officers at a mental institution.

76
00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:28.181
That's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying

77
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:30.392
It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S.
Even in the world.

78
00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:34.145
We take only the
most dangerous, damaged patients.

79
00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:38.108
Ones no other hospital can manage.
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

80
00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:44.447
He's created something really unique here.
It's a hospital for people our society normally...

81
00:09:11.808 --> 00:09:13.310
ID's, gentlemen.

82
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.857
Show your badges, gentlemen.

83
00:09:19.107 --> 00:09:21.401
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times

84
00:09:21.401 --> 00:09:25.614
- By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS...
- Why?

85
00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:27.324
What do you mean?

86
00:09:29.618 --> 00:09:33.288
What do intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about?

87
00:09:33.288 --> 00:09:36.208
I guess you'll have to ask him.

88
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:47.677
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

89
00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:48.970
Marshal Aule.

90
00:09:49.763 --> 00:09:54.017
- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:09:54.017 --> 00:09:55.811
Pleasure, gentlemen.

92
00:09:56.853 --> 00:09:58.647
He had a lot to say about you.

93
00:09:58.647 --> 00:10:01.775
McPherson is a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

94
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:04.236
And what would that be exactly?

95
00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.823
A moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care.

96
00:10:07.823 --> 00:10:12.118
Pardon me Doc...
a what between what and what?

97
00:10:17.707 --> 00:10:20.919
Those paintings are quite accurate.

98
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:23.797
It used to be that the kind of patients we
deal with here

99
00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:26.508
were shackled and left in their own filth.

100
00:10:26.508 --> 00:10:29.845
They were beaten. As if whipping
them bloody would drive the psychosis out.

101
00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:36.643
We drove screws into their brains. We submerged
them in icy water until they lost consciousness.

102
00:10:36.643 --> 00:10:37.978
Or even drown.

103
00:10:38.603 --> 00:10:40.689
- And now?
- We treat them.

104
00:10:40.689 --> 00:10:42.941
Try to heal, try to cure.

105
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:47.863
And if this fails, at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.

106
00:10:47.863 --> 00:10:48.989
These are...

107
00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:52.242
all violent offenders, right?

108
00:10:52.242 --> 00:10:54.119
They've hurt people.

109
00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:58.415
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.

110
00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:04.171
Then personally Doctor, I'd have to
say... screw their sense of calm.

111
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.091
It's my job to treat my patients not
their victims. I'm not here to judge.

112
00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:11.678
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

113
00:11:11.678 --> 00:11:15.307
Excuse me, patient.
One Rachel Solando,

114
00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:19.060
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

115
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.146
Last night, between 10 and midnight.

116
00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:24.483
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.

117
00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.985
She killed all three of her children.

118
00:11:26.985 --> 00:11:30.113
She drowned them in the lake behind her house.

119
00:11:30.113 --> 00:11:33.533
She took them out one by one and held their
heads under until they died.

120
00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:37.120
Then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

121
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.333
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

122
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:43.043
And what about the husband?

123
00:11:43.043 --> 00:11:47.631
He died. On the beaches of Normandy.
She is a war widow.

124
00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:55.180
She starved herself when first she came here.
She insisted the children weren't dead.

125
00:12:02.604 --> 00:12:07.192
- Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you?
- Prone to headaches marshal.

126
00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:09.069
Sometimes, but today...

127
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:12.280
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, Dehydration...

128
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.949
- You alright boss?
- Yes.

129
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:17.077
In that case you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

130
00:12:17.077 --> 00:12:18.745
Thank you so much.

131
00:12:19.037 --> 00:12:23.125
Rachel still believes
her children are alive.

132
00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:27.796
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berckshires.

133
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:28.964
You're kidding me.

134
00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:32.134
She's never once in two years acknowledged
that she is in an institution.

135
00:12:32.134 --> 00:12:33.552
She believes we're all...

136
00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:36.054
deliveryman, milkman, postal workers.

137
00:12:36.054 --> 00:12:40.684
To sustain the illusion that her children never died,
she's created an elaborate fictional structure.

138
00:12:40.684 --> 00:12:44.938
She gives us all parts to play in that fiction.

139
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:49.443
- So have you searched the grounds yet?
- The warden and his men scoured the island,

140
00:12:49.443 --> 00:12:50.652
not a trace.

141
00:12:51.695 --> 00:12:56.283
What's more disturbing is, we don't know
how she got out of her room.

142
00:12:56.283 --> 00:12:58.660
It was locked from the outside

143
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.496
and the only window is barred.

144
00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:08.170
It's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

145
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.303
Brought her right back here after
group therapy, locked her in

146
00:13:16.303 --> 00:13:20.891
I came back for a midnight round
and she was gone.

147
00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:30.275
Seriously doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

148
00:13:30.317 --> 00:13:33.362
I mean, she's in a
mental institution, right?

149
00:13:33.362 --> 00:13:35.447
Seems like something you'd
notice from time to time.

150
00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:39.076
- How many pairs of shoes are the patients given?
- Two pairs.

151
00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:41.286
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,

152
00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:44.081
You can't just choose to get over it.

153
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:46.750
So... she left here barefoot?

154
00:13:48.043 --> 00:13:52.255
Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten
yards in that terrain.

155
00:13:52.255 --> 00:13:53.090
Marshal?

156
00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:14.528
Well this is definitely Rachel's
handwriting.

157
00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:19.157
- I have no idea what the "law of 4" is, though.
- It's not a psychiatric term?

158
00:14:19.157 --> 00:14:20.409
I'm afraid not.

159
00:14:20.409 --> 00:14:21.368
Who's 67?

160
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:24.329
Fuck if I know!

161
00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:27.666
I'd have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion.

162
00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.168
So you think it's
random scribblings?

163
00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:34.131
Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart.
Brilliant in fact.

164
00:14:34.131 --> 00:14:37.259
- This paper could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but...

165
00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:41.096
- We're gonna have to hold onto this.
- Of course.

166
00:14:41.763 --> 00:14:44.766
And you say she had to come through here.

167
00:14:44.766 --> 00:14:48.812
After lights out, the orderlies play
cards in here.

168
00:14:48.812 --> 00:14:54.026
Last night there were 7 men sitting
at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.

169
00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:57.821
Yet somehow, Rachel managed
to slip past them.

170
00:14:57.821 --> 00:14:58.280
Why?

171
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.117
How? She turns invisible?

172
00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:05.704
Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files
of all the medical staff.

173
00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:07.664
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies.

174
00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:11.168
- Anyone who was working then.
- We'll take your request under consideration.

175
00:15:11.168 --> 00:15:13.962
This is not a request, Doctor.

176
00:15:14.212 --> 00:15:16.757
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner...

177
00:15:16.757 --> 00:15:18.842
- Patient.
- Patient...

178
00:15:19.134 --> 00:15:23.597
- has escaped now. You will comply...
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

179
00:15:23.597 --> 00:15:29.019
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff,
do you understand?

180
00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:32.272
I'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner.

181
00:15:32.272 --> 00:15:40.030
If you have any further questions feel
free to join the deputy warden in the search.

182
00:15:49.247 --> 00:15:52.709
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freezing.

183
00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:55.921
The current was strong last night.
The tide pushing in.

184
00:15:55.921 --> 00:16:03.637
She'd have drowned or been crushed on the
rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore.

185
00:16:03.637 --> 00:16:06.890
What about those caves down there,
have you checked them?

186
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.476
No way she could get there.

187
00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:13.647
The base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

188
00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:17.192
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick.

189
00:16:17.192 --> 00:16:21.863
You said it yourself marshal,
she's got no shoes.

190
00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:29.871
All right!
Let's check the other side!

191
00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:37.421
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

192
00:16:37.462 --> 00:16:41.008
The guards already searched inside it.

193
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.722
- What's in there? More patients?
- Sewage treatment facility.

194
00:16:46.722 --> 00:16:48.724
It's getting dark soon.

195
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:50.892
I'm calling this off for the night.

196
00:16:50.892 --> 00:16:52.352
Let's go, boys!

197
00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.859
- You were on watch on the landing, huh?
- Yeah.

198
00:16:58.859 --> 00:17:03.739
Can't nobody get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing.

199
00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:05.616
Okay, Rachel Solando,

200
00:17:05.616 --> 00:17:10.162
who else does she have to pass
to get down here?

201
00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:14.917
Me.

202
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:17.210
Glen Miga.

203
00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:22.591
- Sir, I didn't see nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?

204
00:17:22.591 --> 00:17:24.801
Yes. But I didn't see a thing.

205
00:17:27.262 --> 00:17:27.888
Glen.

206
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.849
Glen.

207
00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:35.520
Tell me the truth.

208
00:17:40.108 --> 00:17:42.527
I maybe... went to the bathroom.

209
00:17:42.527 --> 00:17:48.242
- What? You breached protocol? Christ...
- I wasn't gone more than a minute.

210
00:17:48.242 --> 00:17:51.078
All right, let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

211
00:17:51.078 --> 00:17:54.623
Miss Solando was put in
her room for lights out.

212
00:17:54.623 --> 00:17:57.751
Does anybody here know
what she did before that?

213
00:17:57.751 --> 00:17:58.460
Anyone?

214
00:18:00.254 --> 00:18:03.048
Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.

215
00:18:03.507 --> 00:18:06.718
She was in a group therapy session.

216
00:18:07.344 --> 00:18:09.846
Huh. Did anything unusual occur?

217
00:18:09.846 --> 00:18:11.515
Define "unusual".

218
00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:15.519
- Excuse me.
- It's a mental institution, marshal.

219
00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:17.521
For criminally insane.

220
00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:21.149
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.

221
00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.068
I will rephrase.

222
00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:27.406
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy, that was more...

223
00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:30.534
- let's say, more memorable than...
- Normal?

224
00:18:30.534 --> 00:18:31.285
Exactly!

225
00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:33.537
No. I'm sorry.

226
00:18:34.496 --> 00:18:38.750
Did Mrs. Solando say anything
during group therapy?

227
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.628
She was worried about the rain.

228
00:18:41.879 --> 00:18:44.089
And she hated the food here.

229
00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:48.010
Complained constantly.
Last night included.

230
00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:52.222
So... you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

231
00:18:52.222 --> 00:18:54.516
Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

232
00:18:55.976 --> 00:18:57.102
Dr. Sheehan?

233
00:18:58.478 --> 00:19:01.481
Yes. He was running the session.

234
00:19:02.232 --> 00:19:03.901
He's Rachels's "primary".

235
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:08.405
The psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care.

236
00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:11.325
We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

237
00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:13.911
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

238
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:17.289
He left on the ferry this morning.
His vacation was already planned.

239
00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:19.208
He'd putting it off too long.

240
00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:21.627
You're in a state of lockdown.

241
00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:24.254
A dangerous patient has escaped

242
00:19:24.254 --> 00:19:28.717
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

243
00:19:28.717 --> 00:19:31.053
Of course, he's a doctor.

244
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.144
Do you have the phone number for
where he's gone?

245
00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:40.395
Hello? Hello?

246
00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:43.732
Hello?

247
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.443
Is anybody there?

248
00:19:47.402 --> 00:19:49.822
I'm sorry sir, but its all down.
All the lines.

249
00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:51.490
The storm's hitting the
mainland like a hammer.

250
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:56.286
If you get it working, come find me immediately.
The marshalls need to make an important call.

251
00:19:56.286 --> 00:19:57.162
Yes, sir.

252
00:20:03.794 --> 00:20:06.797
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,

253
00:20:06.797 --> 00:20:09.800
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9

254
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.718
If you'd care to drop by

255
00:20:11.718 --> 00:20:14.555
Good, we can talk then, right?

256
00:20:16.306 --> 00:20:19.143
We have been talking, marshal.

257
00:20:35.075 --> 00:20:38.454
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got
into the wrong line of public service.

258
00:20:38.454 --> 00:20:41.540
It is a little overwhelming.
it was constructed during the Civil War

259
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.211
The same time as the military fort
housing ward C.

260
00:20:52.843 --> 00:20:56.555
This is the original commander's quarters.
When Uncle Sam got the bill

261
00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.265
the commander was court-martialed.

262
00:20:58.265 --> 00:20:59.600
I can see why.

263
00:21:00.517 --> 00:21:03.437
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

264
00:21:03.854 --> 00:21:04.229
No.

265
00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:14.573
It's Mahler.

266
00:21:15.324 --> 00:21:17.367
Quite right, marshal.

267
00:21:17.618 --> 00:21:23.165
Forgive me, gentlemen...
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

268
00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:33.217
"Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor"

269
00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:39.473
- Your poison, gentlemen?
- Rye, if you've got it.

270
00:21:39.473 --> 00:21:41.975
Soda and ice please, thanks.

271
00:21:42.142 --> 00:21:44.561
You don't indulge in alcohol?

272
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:45.979
I am surprised.

273
00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:50.943
Isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe?

274
00:21:50.943 --> 00:21:53.320
Common enough.
And yours?

275
00:21:55.823 --> 00:21:59.910
- I'm sorry?
- Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry...

276
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.747
I've always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

277
00:22:03.747 --> 00:22:05.874
Not that I've noticed.

278
00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:10.462
What's that? Iced tea in your glass there?

279
00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:12.131
Excellent marshal.

280
00:22:12.506 --> 00:22:15.300
You have outstanding defense mechanisms.

281
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.096
You must be quite adept at interrogations, hmm?

282
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:30.607
Men like you... are my specialty.
You know?

283
00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.026
Men of violence.

284
00:22:33.777 --> 00:22:36.363
That's a hell of an assumption to make...

285
00:22:36.363 --> 00:22:41.577
No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand
me, I said you are men of violence

286
00:22:41.577 --> 00:22:45.956
I'm not accusing you of being violent men.
That's quite different.

287
00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:48.751
Please, please, edify us, doctor.

288
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.422
You both served overseas.

289
00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:58.427
Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there

290
00:22:58.427 --> 00:23:00.054
No, you were not.

291
00:23:15.944 --> 00:23:21.992
Since the schoolyard, neither of
you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.

292
00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:27.414
Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat
wasn't something you considered an option.

293
00:23:27.414 --> 00:23:29.750
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

294
00:23:30.334 --> 00:23:31.919
Ah, yes... Raised.

295
00:23:34.505 --> 00:23:37.007
and who raised you, marshal?

296
00:23:37.007 --> 00:23:37.341
Me?

297
00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:40.386
Wolves.

298
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.685
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

299
00:24:46.493 --> 00:24:49.455
Do you believe in God, marshal?

300
00:24:54.418 --> 00:24:56.045
I'm quite serious.

301
00:24:58.464 --> 00:24:59.882
[In German:]
I believe so.

302
00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:06.138
Have you ever seen... a death camp, doctor?

303
00:25:06.847 --> 00:25:11.518
[In German:]
a concentration camp

304
00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:15.798
Me, I was there
at Dachau camp liberation.

305
00:25:15.898 --> 00:25:19.735
Your English is very good, almost flawless.

306
00:25:20.277 --> 00:25:25.824
His English is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.

307
00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.201
You're a German?

308
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:35.918
- Is legal immigration a crime, marshal?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you tell us.

309
00:25:35.918 --> 00:25:41.006
Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan
and the rest of staff as well.

310
00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:43.968
No personnel files will be released for you.
Period.

311
00:25:43.968 --> 00:25:47.221
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

312
00:25:47.221 --> 00:25:50.224
Bullshit, out of the question!
Bullshit!

313
00:25:50.224 --> 00:25:52.810
Who the hell is in charge here anyway, huh?

314
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.772
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to
our board of overseers.

315
00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:58.941
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

316
00:25:58.941 --> 00:26:02.319
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse. And neither do you, sir.

317
00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:06.115
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we will do all we can to help.

318
00:26:06.115 --> 00:26:08.033
This investigation is over.

319
00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:10.536
We're gonna file our reports
and hand it over to...

320
00:26:10.536 --> 00:26:13.372
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.

321
00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:15.457
We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning.

322
00:26:15.457 --> 00:26:16.834
Come on, Chuck.

323
00:26:25.676 --> 00:26:26.760
Nice night.

324
00:26:33.183 --> 00:26:36.895
You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter.

325
00:26:47.907 --> 00:26:51.660
Hey boss?... We really packing it in?

326
00:26:52.494 --> 00:26:52.912
Why?

327
00:26:54.496 --> 00:26:59.084
I guess, I dunno, I just...
never really quit anything before.

328
00:26:59.084 --> 00:27:02.713
We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck.

329
00:27:02.713 --> 00:27:08.761
Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of
a locked cell barefoot without any help.

330
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:10.846
I think she had a lot of help.

331
00:27:10.846 --> 00:27:13.474
Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion
right now,

332
00:27:13.474 --> 00:27:16.185
rethinking his whole attitude.

333
00:27:17.228 --> 00:27:21.106
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?

334
00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:22.983
I didn't say that.

335
00:27:41.627 --> 00:27:44.838
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

336
00:27:44.838 --> 00:27:47.758
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

337
00:27:47.758 --> 00:27:51.095
I killed a lot of people in the war.

338
00:27:52.596 --> 00:27:54.723
Is that why you drink?

339
00:27:57.351 --> 00:27:58.644
Are you real?

340
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:00.145
No.

341
00:28:05.276 --> 00:28:06.944
She's still here.

342
00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:07.945
Who?

343
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.489
Rachel?

344
00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:14.368
She never left.

345
00:28:27.923 --> 00:28:32.511
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

346
00:28:32.553 --> 00:28:34.096
We were so happy.

347
00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:37.600
She's here.

348
00:28:38.184 --> 00:28:39.643
You can't leave.

349
00:28:52.781 --> 00:28:54.742
I'm not gonna leave.

350
00:28:56.243 --> 00:28:58.120
I love you so much.

351
00:29:02.583 --> 00:29:06.378
- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.

352
00:29:07.588 --> 00:29:08.088
I am.

353
00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:14.136
You have to wake up.

354
00:29:15.429 --> 00:29:16.597
I won't go.

355
00:29:18.015 --> 00:29:19.225
You're here.

356
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.436
I'm not.

357
00:29:23.938 --> 00:29:26.065
You have to face that.

358
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:29.693
But she is.

359
00:29:32.112 --> 00:29:33.364
And so is he.

360
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:36.408
Who?

361
00:29:39.286 --> 00:29:40.079
Laeddis.

362
00:29:45.543 --> 00:29:46.877
I have to go.

363
00:29:50.673 --> 00:29:52.508
No! Please...just let me hold you.

364
00:29:53.134 --> 00:29:55.678
- Just a little bit longer.
- Oh, Teddy...

365
00:29:55.678 --> 00:29:56.720
You have to let me go.

366
00:29:59.098 --> 00:30:00.141
I can't.

367
00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:36.260
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

368
00:30:39.305 --> 00:30:39.972
Doctor.

369
00:30:41.056 --> 00:30:42.433
Doctor, doctor.

370
00:30:43.225 --> 00:30:46.353
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

371
00:30:46.353 --> 00:30:48.230
I thought your investigation was finished?

372
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.275
It's not like we can take the ferry.

373
00:30:51.275 --> 00:30:55.863
Now was Rachel receiving any
other treatment for her illnesses?

374
00:30:55.863 --> 00:30:59.325
Do you know the state of the
mental health field these days, gentlemen?

375
00:30:59.325 --> 00:31:01.535
No. Not a clue doctor.

376
00:31:01.702 --> 00:31:02.161
War.

377
00:31:03.037 --> 00:31:05.956
The old school believes in
surgical intervention.

378
00:31:05.956 --> 00:31:11.420
Psychosurgery.
Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy.

379
00:31:11.545 --> 00:31:15.966
Some say the patients become reasonable, docile.
Others say they become zombies.

380
00:31:17.093 --> 00:31:19.011
- And the new school?
- Psycho pharmacology.

381
00:31:19.261 --> 00:31:21.639
A new drug has just been
approved called Thorazine.

382
00:31:21.639 --> 00:31:23.015
Which relaxes psychotic patients.

383
00:31:23.182 --> 00:31:24.391
You could say it tames them.

384
00:31:25.101 --> 00:31:26.685
- And which school are you in, Doc?
- Me?

385
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.564
I have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect,

386
00:31:30.981 --> 00:31:31.899
listen to him,

387
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.944
try and understand,
you just might reach him.

388
00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:43.494
- These patients?
- Even these.

389
00:31:43.911 --> 00:31:46.288
What should be a last resort is
becoming a first response.

390
00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.749
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
and it all goes away.

391
00:31:50.418 --> 00:31:52.711
Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs

392
00:31:53.045 --> 00:31:56.757
meant to keep her from becoming violent,
but it was only intermittently effective.

393
00:31:57.883 --> 00:32:01.595
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done.

394
00:32:03.055 --> 00:32:03.806
"Was."

395
00:32:05.057 --> 00:32:08.894
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, doctor?

396
00:32:12.732 --> 00:32:14.859
Look outside, marshal.

397
00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:17.319
Why do you think?

398
00:32:23.242 --> 00:32:27.163
Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted
his father's nurse with a broken glass.

399
00:32:27.204 --> 00:32:30.916
Nurse survived, but
her face permaanently disfigured.

400
00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:32.251
I can't wait.

401
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:35.713
She'd smiles at me.
She was so sweet.

402
00:32:35.713 --> 00:32:40.718
But... I could see it in her eyes.
She liked to be naked.

403
00:32:40.718 --> 00:32:42.428
To suck cock.

404
00:32:43.554 --> 00:32:45.431
Okay, Mr. Breen.

405
00:32:45.806 --> 00:32:49.393
And then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water?

406
00:32:49.393 --> 00:32:53.105
Alone in the kitchen?
Like that's no big deal?

407
00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:56.484
- Why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

408
00:32:56.484 --> 00:33:02.198
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it.

409
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.366
Mr. Breen,

410
00:33:05.868 --> 00:33:09.622
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

411
00:33:10.748 --> 00:33:13.334
When I cut her she screamed

412
00:33:14.794 --> 00:33:15.378
But...

413
00:33:16.587 --> 00:33:17.963
She scared me.

414
00:33:18.464 --> 00:33:20.383
What did she expect?

415
00:33:20.758 --> 00:33:21.842
Interesting.

416
00:33:23.052 --> 00:33:26.597
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, okay?

417
00:33:26.597 --> 00:33:28.140
Rachel Solando...

418
00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:31.060
Did you know she had drowned her own kids?

419
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.978
She drowned her kids!

420
00:33:33.354 --> 00:33:36.607
This is a sick fucking world
we live in. I'll tell you that...

421
00:33:36.607 --> 00:33:38.192
You know what? They should be gassed.

422
00:33:38.192 --> 00:33:41.445
All of them... the retards, the killers

423
00:33:41.821 --> 00:33:46.200
the niggers. You kill your own kid?
Gas the bitch!

424
00:33:48.494 --> 00:33:50.287
Would you... stop that?

425
00:33:52.039 --> 00:33:54.542
- A nurse?
- Please. Stop that.

426
00:33:54.542 --> 00:33:57.753
A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh?

427
00:33:59.088 --> 00:34:00.214
A husband...

428
00:34:02.216 --> 00:34:04.552
Just trying to make ends meet,

429
00:34:05.845 --> 00:34:08.097
to lead a normal life...

430
00:34:08.973 --> 00:34:11.142
And it says in your file that uh...

431
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.770
You tore her face off, didn't you?

432
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.569
Congratulations, no more normal
for her, not ever again, no.

433
00:34:22.236 --> 00:34:25.573
Do you know what she was afraid of?

434
00:34:27.533 --> 00:34:27.950
You.

435
00:34:28.576 --> 00:34:31.162
Could you stop that, please?!

436
00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:33.581
Stop that!

437
00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:36.500
Please... stop!

438
00:34:36.917 --> 00:34:41.213
You know a patient by the name of Andrew Laeddis?

439
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.133
- I want to go back.
- Take him!

440
00:35:01.317 --> 00:35:03.277
I'll never get out of here.

441
00:35:03.277 --> 00:35:05.363
I'm not sure that I should.

442
00:35:06.739 --> 00:35:08.491
Excuse me for saying this,

443
00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:10.618
- Miss Kearns...
- Misses.

444
00:35:10.618 --> 00:35:11.744
Mrs. Kearns.

445
00:35:13.621 --> 00:35:15.081
But you seem...

446
00:35:15.706 --> 00:35:17.208
quite normal,...

447
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.961
I mean in comparison
with the other patients here.

448
00:35:19.961 --> 00:35:24.632
Well, I have my dark days
I suppose everybody does.

449
00:35:24.799 --> 00:35:30.429
The difference is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe.

450
00:35:30.429 --> 00:35:34.141
Although personally I think if a
man beats you and fucks

451
00:35:34.183 --> 00:35:38.729
half the women he sees
and no one will help you,

452
00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:44.026
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you can do.

453
00:35:44.026 --> 00:35:46.654
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

454
00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:49.407
And what would I do if I did?

455
00:35:49.407 --> 00:35:52.994
I don't know the world anymore.
They say there are

456
00:35:52.994 --> 00:35:56.205
bombs that can reduce whole
cities to ash

457
00:35:56.205 --> 00:35:59.333
And what do they call "televisions"...

458
00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:02.545
voices and faces coming from a box.

459
00:36:02.753 --> 00:36:05.339
I hear enough voices already

460
00:36:05.798 --> 00:36:09.010
What can you tell us about Rachel?

461
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.307
Um. Not much, she... she keeps to herself.

462
00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:18.603
She believed her kids were alive.

463
00:36:18.603 --> 00:36:24.150
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires and we were all neighbours

464
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.153
- The milkman, postmen...
- Deliveryman,

465
00:36:28.654 --> 00:36:30.907
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

466
00:36:30.907 --> 00:36:31.365
Yes. Um.

467
00:36:33.034 --> 00:36:35.119
He talked about anger.

468
00:36:37.288 --> 00:36:39.206
Tell me about him...

469
00:36:39.707 --> 00:36:41.208
What's he like?

470
00:36:41.792 --> 00:36:43.002
I think he's uh...

471
00:36:47.006 --> 00:36:48.007
Okay... nice.

472
00:36:50.134 --> 00:36:54.513
Not hard on the eyes
as my mother would say.

473
00:36:55.097 --> 00:36:57.850
Did he ever make a pass at you?

474
00:36:57.934 --> 00:36:58.309
No.

475
00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:04.649
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good
doctor, he would never...

476
00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:08.611
Could I have a glass of water, please?

477
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:09.654
No problem.

478
00:37:24.877 --> 00:37:26.712
Thank you, marshal.

479
00:37:31.342 --> 00:37:35.346
I have just one more question for you
Mrs. Kearns.

480
00:37:37.807 --> 00:37:40.685
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

481
00:37:44.063 --> 00:37:44.730
No.

482
00:37:46.566 --> 00:37:48.401
Never heard of him.

483
00:37:54.115 --> 00:37:55.658
She was coached.

484
00:37:55.867 --> 00:37:59.328
She used practically the same words as
Cawley and the nurse.

485
00:37:59.328 --> 00:38:02.290
- Like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who is Andrew Laeddis?

486
00:38:06.794 --> 00:38:12.008
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

487
00:38:14.844 --> 00:38:18.097
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner
for the Christ's sake!

488
00:38:18.264 --> 00:38:20.224
We just met, Chuck.

489
00:38:20.683 --> 00:38:22.435
You've been on the beat a long time.

490
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.814
You got a duty, got a career.
What I'm doing,

491
00:38:26.814 --> 00:38:29.108
is not exactly by the book.

492
00:38:30.443 --> 00:38:37.116
I don't give a damn about "by the book", boss
I just to know what the hell is going on.

493
00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:43.664
When this case came over the wires,

494
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.878
- I requested it specifically. Do you understand?
- Why?

495
00:38:50.505 --> 00:38:51.881
Andrew Laeddis,

496
00:38:53.132 --> 00:38:57.887
was the maintenance man in the apartment
building where my wife and I lived.

497
00:38:58.763 --> 00:38:59.472
Okay.

498
00:39:01.891 --> 00:39:04.018
He was also a firebug.

499
00:39:06.687 --> 00:39:09.357
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

500
00:39:12.026 --> 00:39:15.863
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

501
00:39:23.037 --> 00:39:23.913
Let 'em out!

502
00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:29.168
What happened to Laeddis?

503
00:39:29.168 --> 00:39:33.172
Got away with it.
Laeddis got away with it and disappeared.

504
00:39:33.673 --> 00:39:35.967
About a year ago, I opened up the
newspaper and there he is.

505
00:39:35.967 --> 00:39:38.136
He's an ugly looking son of a bitch.

506
00:39:38.136 --> 00:39:40.763
He had a new scar from his right temple
down to his left lip.

507
00:39:40.763 --> 00:39:44.183
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you forget.

508
00:39:44.183 --> 00:39:47.353
He'd burned down a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.

509
00:39:47.353 --> 00:39:49.272
He said voices told him to do it.

510
00:39:49.272 --> 00:39:51.983
First he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here.

511
00:39:51.983 --> 00:39:54.152
- Then what?
- Then, nothing.

512
00:39:54.152 --> 00:39:58.114
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

513
00:39:58.114 --> 00:40:00.783
I'm sure he's not in ward B
that leaves ward C.

514
00:40:00.783 --> 00:40:01.993
Or he could be dead.

515
00:40:01.993 --> 00:40:07.582
So could Rachel Solando for that matter.
Lot of places to hide a body here.

516
00:40:08.124 --> 00:40:11.919
Only one place
no one really knows.

517
00:40:22.472 --> 00:40:26.517
That patient, Bridget Kearne,
when she sent me for water,

518
00:40:26.517 --> 00:40:29.562
she said something to you back there, didn't she?

519
00:40:29.562 --> 00:40:29.896
No.

520
00:40:32.732 --> 00:40:34.025
Come on boss!

521
00:40:37.653 --> 00:40:38.946
She wrote it.

522
00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:55.046
Boss!

523
00:40:56.297 --> 00:40:59.967
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into fucking Kansas out here...

524
00:40:59.967 --> 00:41:02.470
- All right.
- Now. Let's go!

525
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:05.932
Watch out!

526
00:41:08.684 --> 00:41:09.268
Jesus!

527
00:41:11.813 --> 00:41:14.065
Come on! Let's go back!

528
00:41:31.499 --> 00:41:33.626
Jesus Christ!
Damn it!

529
00:41:44.637 --> 00:41:48.891
- Are you okay boss?
- Yes. That's all right.

530
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.316
So... if Laeddis is here...

531
00:41:57.316 --> 00:42:00.194
What are you going to do boss?

532
00:42:01.779 --> 00:42:04.574
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

533
00:42:11.956 --> 00:42:15.752
If it was my wife
I'd kill him twice.

534
00:42:25.511 --> 00:42:31.726
When we got through the gates of Dachau,
the SS guards surrendered.

535
00:42:38.608 --> 00:42:44.030
The commandante tried to kill himself
before we got there...

536
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.158
but he botched it.

537
00:42:48.326 --> 00:42:50.578
Took him an hour to die.

538
00:42:55.083 --> 00:42:59.629
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

539
00:43:03.383 --> 00:43:05.051
Too many to count.

540
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:33.830
Too many to imagine.

541
00:43:36.499 --> 00:43:37.250
So yeah

542
00:43:40.253 --> 00:43:45.883
The guards surrendered, we took
their guns, we lined them up...

543
00:44:28.259 --> 00:44:29.927
It wasn't warfare,

544
00:44:32.305 --> 00:44:33.640
it was murder.

545
00:44:38.019 --> 00:44:40.063
And I've had enough of killing.

546
00:44:42.899 --> 00:44:45.234
That's not why I'm here.

547
00:44:45.818 --> 00:44:48.154
So what is this all about?

548
00:44:50.198 --> 00:44:52.283
After Laeddis vanished,

549
00:44:53.242 --> 00:44:57.330
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliffe.

550
00:44:57.413 --> 00:45:02.460
A lot of people knew about this place, but no
one wants to talk...

551
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.463
You know? It's like they're scared of something.

552
00:45:06.339 --> 00:45:10.176
You know this place is funded by
a special grant

553
00:45:10.176 --> 00:45:13.388
from the House of
Unamerican Activities Committee.

554
00:45:13.388 --> 00:45:19.560
HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting
the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor?

555
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.939
By conducting experiments on the mind.

556
00:45:23.523 --> 00:45:25.024
At least that's my guess.

557
00:45:25.024 --> 00:45:27.026
And you think thats going on in here?

558
00:45:27.026 --> 00:45:29.320
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

559
00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.156
Until I found someone
who used to be a patient here.

560
00:45:32.156 --> 00:45:34.033
Guy's name is George Noyce.

561
00:45:34.033 --> 00:45:36.661
Nice college kid.
Socialist.

562
00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:40.373
He gets offered some money to do a
psych study. Guess what they were testing?

563
00:45:40.373 --> 00:45:43.710
- Tooth paste?
- So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

564
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:47.839
Almost beats his professor to death
Ends up here in Ashecliffe.

565
00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:49.340
Ward C.

566
00:45:49.632 --> 00:45:53.052
They released him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?

567
00:45:53.052 --> 00:45:58.850
Two weeks on the mainland he walks into
a bar and stabs three men to death.

568
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.728
His lawyer pleads insanity,
but Noyce...

569
00:46:01.728 --> 00:46:03.896
Noyce, he stands up in the courtroom and

570
00:46:03.896 --> 00:46:05.773
he begs the judge,
for the electric chair.

571
00:46:05.773 --> 00:46:08.693
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

572
00:46:08.693 --> 00:46:12.447
Judge gives him life in Dedham prison.

573
00:46:12.447 --> 00:46:16.576
- And you found him?
- Yeah, I found him.

574
00:46:16.576 --> 00:46:17.744
Well, he's a mess

575
00:46:19.704 --> 00:46:22.624
- But it's pretty clear from what he tells me, ...
- What?

576
00:46:22.624 --> 00:46:25.627
... they're experimenting on people here.

577
00:46:25.627 --> 00:46:27.587
I don't know, boss.

578
00:46:29.172 --> 00:46:31.883
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it isn't it?

579
00:46:31.883 --> 00:46:36.596
Crazy people are perfect subjects.
They talk, but nobody listens.

580
00:46:36.596 --> 00:46:38.306
I stood in Dachau.

581
00:46:38.348 --> 00:46:43.519
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

582
00:46:43.728 --> 00:46:45.813
For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war

583
00:46:45.813 --> 00:46:48.274
to stop them, and now
I find out it may be happening here?

584
00:46:48.274 --> 00:46:51.110
On our soil?
No.

585
00:46:52.195 --> 00:46:55.198
So what are you really here to do, Teddy?

586
00:46:55.198 --> 00:46:57.742
I'm gonna get the proof,

587
00:46:57.742 --> 00:47:01.996
I'm gonna go back, and blow
the lid off this place.

588
00:47:01.996 --> 00:47:02.914
That's it.

589
00:47:03.957 --> 00:47:05.333
Wait a minute.

590
00:47:06.543 --> 00:47:09.254
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.

591
00:47:09.254 --> 00:47:14.551
Waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a US marshal?

592
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:17.428
I got lucky. There was a patient escape,
it was the perfect excuse.

593
00:47:17.428 --> 00:47:20.515
No, no, no boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

594
00:47:20.515 --> 00:47:25.228
The world doesn't work that way. They got an
electrified fence around a septic facility.

595
00:47:25.228 --> 00:47:28.481
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

596
00:47:28.815 --> 00:47:32.986
A chief of staff with ties to the OSS
Funding from HUAC?

597
00:47:32.986 --> 00:47:37.156
Jesus Christ! Everything about this place
stinks of "government ops".

598
00:47:37.156 --> 00:47:39.242
- What If they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

599
00:47:39.242 --> 00:47:41.119
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit.

600
00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:46.457
Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is
one shred of evidence that she even existed?

601
00:47:46.457 --> 00:47:48.918
There's no way they could of known I'd be
assigned to this case. No way...

602
00:47:48.918 --> 00:47:51.921
While you were looking into them,
they were looking into you.

603
00:47:51.921 --> 00:47:54.591
All they need to do
is fake an escape to get you here.

604
00:47:54.591 --> 00:47:59.554
And now they have you.
Now they have us both, here, now.

605
00:48:02.265 --> 00:48:03.683
Marshal, are you out here?

606
00:48:04.767 --> 00:48:06.936
This is deputy warden McPherson.

607
00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:08.438
Marshal!

608
00:48:08.813 --> 00:48:10.356
How about that? They found us huh.

609
00:48:10.356 --> 00:48:13.693
It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us.

610
00:48:15.028 --> 00:48:16.154
I know you are in there...

611
00:48:17.989 --> 00:48:20.366
We're getting off of this Goddamned island.
You and me.

612
00:48:20.867 --> 00:48:21.826
Come on!

613
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.415
- Come on!
- Go!

614
00:48:37.425 --> 00:48:40.512
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

615
00:48:41.304 --> 00:48:44.265
And hurry up, this thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

616
00:48:49.896 --> 00:48:51.397
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.

617
00:48:52.357 --> 00:48:53.441
It should be ready by tomorrow.

618
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.985
That is if we don't all wash away first.

619
00:48:57.153 --> 00:49:01.241
Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were
pretty much done for.

620
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:02.867
So...

621
00:49:05.036 --> 00:49:06.412
This is our only choice, huh?

622
00:49:07.247 --> 00:49:10.208
Got something really nice in prison already
if that don't work for you...

623
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.669
Now that you mention it, these are just fine.

624
00:49:14.128 --> 00:49:17.340
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all ward C patients

625
00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.675
be placed in manual restraints.

626
00:49:19.551 --> 00:49:22.804
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

627
00:49:23.304 --> 00:49:25.682
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island,

628
00:49:25.807 --> 00:49:27.267
in the middle of the ocean,
during a hurricane.

629
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.894
A lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility.

630
00:49:29.894 --> 00:49:32.647
It's a gamble, Steven.
Say the power fails, ...

631
00:49:32.897 --> 00:49:33.857
There's a backup generator.

632
00:49:34.107 --> 00:49:36.526
And if that goes? The cell doors
will open.

633
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:39.612
Where are they going to go?

634
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:43.658
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

635
00:49:43.658 --> 00:49:47.787
You're quite right. They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

636
00:49:48.788 --> 00:49:50.582
If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.

637
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.334
That's 24 human beings.

638
00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.045
You can live with that, can you?

639
00:49:56.254 --> 00:49:57.839
Frankly, if it were up to me,

640
00:49:58.131 --> 00:50:01.509
I'd put all 42 in wards A and B in
manual restraints as well.

641
00:50:01.634 --> 00:50:02.469
Excuse me
Excuse me

642
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:07.140
- Marshal.
- I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.

643
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.433
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

644
00:50:08.433 --> 00:50:11.227
We spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note.

645
00:50:11.394 --> 00:50:13.062
The law of 4, I loved that.

646
00:50:13.062 --> 00:50:16.691
You said you had no idea what
that second line could refer to. Correct?

647
00:50:17.734 --> 00:50:18.902
Who is 67?

648
00:50:18.902 --> 00:50:22.655
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

649
00:50:22.655 --> 00:50:24.741
Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.

650
00:50:27.577 --> 00:50:28.328
Nothing?

651
00:50:32.749 --> 00:50:34.626
Because I believe I just heard
you say there are

652
00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:37.337
24 patients in ward C.

653
00:50:38.046 --> 00:50:40.632
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B

654
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.260
Which means there is a total of what?
66 patients here in this facility.

655
00:50:45.553 --> 00:50:46.888
That is correct, yes.

656
00:50:50.183 --> 00:50:52.852
Then it seems that
Rachel Solando was suggesting

657
00:50:53.353 --> 00:50:56.606
that you have a 67th patient, doctor.

658
00:50:57.732 --> 00:51:01.069
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This is ridiculous.

659
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:03.613
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddamn job.

660
00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:06.783
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

661
00:51:08.076 --> 00:51:09.744
No, what's the good news, doctor?

662
00:51:10.745 --> 00:51:12.122
Rachel has been found.

663
00:51:13.623 --> 00:51:14.582
She's here.

664
00:51:16.292 --> 00:51:17.335
Safe and sound.

665
00:51:29.556 --> 00:51:30.640
There is not a mark on her.

666
00:51:35.145 --> 00:51:36.146
Who are these men?

667
00:51:39.733 --> 00:51:41.151
Why are they in my house?

668
00:51:41.651 --> 00:51:43.069
Police officers, Rachel.

669
00:51:43.403 --> 00:51:45.739
They... have a few questions.

670
00:51:49.701 --> 00:51:50.410
Ma'am.

671
00:51:53.663 --> 00:51:56.833
There's been a sighting of a known
Communist

672
00:51:56.833 --> 00:52:00.295
subversive in this area
passing out literature

673
00:52:02.297 --> 00:52:03.673
Here?

674
00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:07.260
In this neighborhood?

675
00:52:07.802 --> 00:52:08.970
Yes, I'm afraid so.

676
00:52:10.597 --> 00:52:14.059
Now, if you can tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

677
00:52:14.726 --> 00:52:16.269
it would really help us narrow our search.

678
00:52:18.271 --> 00:52:18.897
Yes...

679
00:52:22.275 --> 00:52:23.276
Well, I...umm

680
00:52:26.905 --> 00:52:30.867
I made breakfast for Jim
and the children,

681
00:52:31.159 --> 00:52:32.410
and then I...

682
00:52:34.662 --> 00:52:37.916
I packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

683
00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:44.089
Then I sent the children off to school.

684
00:52:47.592 --> 00:52:48.635
And then...

685
00:52:55.266 --> 00:52:59.270
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

686
00:53:05.276 --> 00:53:06.069
I see...

687
00:53:10.365 --> 00:53:11.825
And after that?

688
00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:21.042
After that...

689
00:53:30.635 --> 00:53:32.303
I thought of you.

690
00:53:38.518 --> 00:53:40.061
I... I'm sorry, ma'am.

691
00:53:40.061 --> 00:53:43.565
I don't know what you're talking about.

692
00:53:45.608 --> 00:53:49.529
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

693
00:53:54.367 --> 00:53:55.702
You're gone...

694
00:53:59.664 --> 00:54:00.874
You're dead.

695
00:54:06.004 --> 00:54:08.798
I cry every night.

696
00:54:13.887 --> 00:54:16.640
How am I supposed to survive?

697
00:54:18.683 --> 00:54:19.100
God.

698
00:54:29.611 --> 00:54:32.530
Rachel... it will be all right.

699
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.911
I'm so sorry, but...

700
00:54:39.412 --> 00:54:42.624
everything is gonna be all right? Okay?

701
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.460
I buried you.

702
00:54:47.796 --> 00:54:52.801
I buried an empty casket. Your body
rained down lumps of flesh splashing

703
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:54.302
into the sea eaten by sharks.

704
00:54:58.431 --> 00:55:02.352
My Jim is dead,
So who the fuck are you?

705
00:55:04.437 --> 00:55:06.481
Who the fuck are you?!

706
00:55:07.065 --> 00:55:09.484
Who are you?! Who are you?!

707
00:55:19.411 --> 00:55:21.204
I'm sorry about that.

708
00:55:21.204 --> 00:55:24.624
I didn't want to interrupt, I thought
she might tell you something, but...

709
00:55:24.624 --> 00:55:26.751
we found her down by the lighthouse,

710
00:55:26.751 --> 00:55:28.211
skipping stones.

711
00:55:29.629 --> 00:55:33.341
We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going
to ask you both to go down into basement.

712
00:55:33.341 --> 00:55:37.512
There's food, water, and cots.
It's the safest place to be

713
00:55:37.512 --> 00:55:39.723
when the hurricane hits.

714
00:55:43.268 --> 00:55:45.353
Are you all right?
You look pale.

715
00:55:45.353 --> 00:55:47.522
I'm fine, it's just uh...

716
00:55:48.523 --> 00:55:50.358
Boss, are you okay?

717
00:55:51.318 --> 00:55:53.737
It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it?

718
00:55:53.737 --> 00:55:58.408
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes?
Marshal are you having a migraine?

719
00:55:58.408 --> 00:55:59.534
I'll be alright.

720
00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:11.254
- What's wrong with him.
- Take these, marshal. You'll sleep a couple of hours, wake up clear as a bell.

721
00:56:11.254 --> 00:56:13.715
He's having a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and

722
00:56:13.715 --> 00:56:15.842
filled it with razors then shook it
as hard as they could.

723
00:56:15.842 --> 00:56:17.385
Take the pills, marshal.

724
00:56:17.385 --> 00:56:22.265
- No... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.

725
00:56:25.894 --> 00:56:28.146
He's going to need to lie down.

726
00:56:33.652 --> 00:56:34.402
Oh God!

727
00:56:49.918 --> 00:56:51.753
Careful. All right.

728
00:56:53.129 --> 00:56:55.131
Gonna be okay. Relax.

729
00:57:01.972 --> 00:57:03.932
- Who is that?
- Him?

730
00:57:04.891 --> 00:57:06.601
That's the warden.

731
00:57:08.603 --> 00:57:11.690
Don't you worry about him, alright?

732
00:57:17.237 --> 00:57:19.906
Looks like an ex-military prick.

733
00:57:20.699 --> 00:57:24.578
You know what? I ain't gonna argue
with you on that one.

734
00:58:49.204 --> 00:58:51.581
You should have saved me.

735
00:58:53.583 --> 00:58:56.628
You should have saved all of us.

736
00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:26.867
Hey buddy.

737
00:59:28.952 --> 00:59:29.703
Hey.

738
00:59:30.203 --> 00:59:30.954
Laeddis.

739
00:59:33.123 --> 00:59:34.499
Yes.

740
00:59:45.302 --> 00:59:46.303
Hi, buddy.

741
00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:49.931
No hard feelings, right?

742
00:59:56.354 --> 00:59:57.939
No hard feelings.

743
01:00:11.536 --> 01:00:13.997
Little something for later.

744
01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:20.086
Because I know how much you need it.

745
01:00:25.717 --> 01:00:28.220
Clock's ticking, my friend.

746
01:00:28.553 --> 01:00:31.098
We're running out of time.

747
01:00:40.357 --> 01:00:42.317
Give me a hand here.

748
01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.050
I could get into trouble.

749
01:01:34.619 --> 01:01:35.579
I'm dead?

750
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.209
I'm so sorry.

751
01:01:41.501 --> 01:01:44.921
Why didn't you save me?

752
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.426
I tried, I wanted to,
but by the time I got there,

753
01:01:49.426 --> 01:01:51.011
it was too late.

754
01:02:13.784 --> 01:02:15.285
See?

755
01:02:17.204 --> 01:02:18.997
Aren't they beautiful?

756
01:03:13.427 --> 01:03:15.929
Why are you all wet, baby?

757
01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.933
Laeddis isn't dead.

758
01:03:21.268 --> 01:03:22.644
He isn't gone.

759
01:03:24.146 --> 01:03:25.731
He's still here.

760
01:03:28.942 --> 01:03:29.693
I know.

761
01:03:29.985 --> 01:03:32.404
We need to find him, Teddy.

762
01:03:32.404 --> 01:03:35.365
You need to find him and
you kill him dead.

763
01:03:52.382 --> 01:03:53.425
Shhh. It's okay.

764
01:04:06.021 --> 01:04:06.605
Shh. Again!

765
01:04:07.064 --> 01:04:08.899
The generator is flooded.

766
01:04:13.862 --> 01:04:15.697
Are you okay boss?

767
01:04:17.908 --> 01:04:19.868
This goddamn migraine!

768
01:04:19.868 --> 01:04:24.498
Back up generators failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

769
01:04:25.499 --> 01:04:27.751
What do you want to do?

770
01:04:33.131 --> 01:04:33.799
Christ!

771
01:04:34.508 --> 01:04:36.927
No, no, no!
Put it down.

772
01:04:37.469 --> 01:04:38.387
Now! Now!

773
01:04:49.314 --> 01:04:52.109
You think the whole
electrical system is fried?

774
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:55.195
I'd say that it's a good possibility.

775
01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:57.197
All electronic security...

776
01:04:57.197 --> 01:04:59.032
fences, gates, the doors

777
01:05:00.075 --> 01:05:00.867
Come on.

778
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:03.620
Nice day for a stroll
don't you think?

779
01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.832
To ward C for example.

780
01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:11.795
Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis.

781
01:05:16.008 --> 01:05:18.885
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

782
01:05:18.885 --> 01:05:21.763
He told me this is where they keep
the worse ones.

783
01:05:21.763 --> 01:05:25.726
The guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

784
01:05:26.435 --> 01:05:28.729
Noyce give you anything on the layout?

785
01:05:28.729 --> 01:05:29.813
Not really.

786
01:05:30.063 --> 01:05:33.942
All that he remembers was people
scream day and night. There were no windows.

787
01:05:33.942 --> 01:05:36.403
There were bars everywhere.

788
01:05:56.715 --> 01:05:58.008
Jesus Christ!

789
01:05:58.967 --> 01:06:01.720
First time
on ward C, right?

790
01:06:02.054 --> 01:06:03.764
- Yes, yes...
- Yes.

791
01:06:03.764 --> 01:06:07.976
- Yeah, heard stories, but...
- Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.

792
01:06:07.976 --> 01:06:10.479
We got most of the bugsies locked down now,

793
01:06:10.479 --> 01:06:12.522
But some of them are still loose.

794
01:06:12.522 --> 01:06:15.275
If you see one don't try
to restrain him yourselves.

795
01:06:15.275 --> 01:06:16.985
These fuckers will kill you.

796
01:06:16.985 --> 01:06:17.569
Clear?

797
01:06:18.695 --> 01:06:22.199
Alright. Get your asses moving then.
Go on.

798
01:07:18.422 --> 01:07:19.423
He's here.

799
01:07:23.594 --> 01:07:24.386
Laeddis.

800
01:07:25.888 --> 01:07:27.389
I can feel him.

801
01:07:31.226 --> 01:07:32.811
Tag! You're it.

802
01:07:34.479 --> 01:07:34.897
Ted!

803
01:08:31.036 --> 01:08:32.329
Listen to me!

804
01:08:32.996 --> 01:08:35.082
Listen!
I do not want to leave, all right?

805
01:08:35.374 --> 01:08:39.503
Why would anyone want to?
We hear things here.

806
01:08:39.503 --> 01:08:42.130
About the outside world.
About atolls.

807
01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:44.842
About the h-bomb tests.

808
01:08:44.842 --> 01:08:47.928
You know how
a hydrogen bomb works?

809
01:08:47.928 --> 01:08:50.597
- With... Hydrogen?
- That's funny.

810
01:08:50.597 --> 01:08:53.308
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

811
01:08:53.934 --> 01:08:57.104
But not the hydrogen bomb
It implodes.

812
01:08:57.104 --> 01:09:01.608
Creating an explosion to the thousandth
millionth degree.

813
01:09:01.608 --> 01:09:03.527
- Do you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

814
01:09:03.527 --> 01:09:05.195
- Do you?
- I get it!

815
01:09:05.195 --> 01:09:07.239
Let em go!

816
01:09:21.628 --> 01:09:23.130
No!

817
01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:25.507
What are you doing?

818
01:09:26.967 --> 01:09:28.760
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

819
01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:30.846
You got Billings?

820
01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.975
What's the fuck's the matter with you guys?
You catch them, not kill them!

821
01:09:34.975 --> 01:09:35.809
He jumped us.

822
01:09:35.976 --> 01:09:39.271
You, give me a hand with him.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.

823
01:09:39.771 --> 01:09:40.606
Goddamnit!

824
01:09:40.647 --> 01:09:42.983
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk.

825
01:09:43.692 --> 01:09:44.443
Come on!

826
01:09:44.443 --> 01:09:46.612
Paula's gonna have my Goddamn
balls for this..

827
01:10:18.477 --> 01:10:19.520
<i>Laeddis....</i>

828
01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:41.875
<i>Laeddis....</i>

829
01:10:54.805 --> 01:10:55.597
Please...

830
01:10:55.597 --> 01:10:57.099
Oh my God!

831
01:10:59.268 --> 01:11:01.937
<i>Stop me.
Before I kill more.</i>

832
01:11:02.813 --> 01:11:04.064
<i>Laeddis ...</i>

833
01:11:08.318 --> 01:11:08.986
Go!

834
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:13.741
<i>Please, please!</i>

835
01:11:22.124 --> 01:11:24.126
<i>Laeddis ...</i>

836
01:11:31.341 --> 01:11:33.469
<i>You told me I'd be free of
this place.</i>

837
01:11:35.012 --> 01:11:36.680
<i>You promised.</i>

838
01:11:38.474 --> 01:11:39.975
<i>You lied.</i>

839
01:11:40.309 --> 01:11:41.060
Laeddis?

840
01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:48.525
Laeddis?

841
01:11:50.527 --> 01:11:51.987
That's pretty damned funny.

842
01:11:54.114 --> 01:11:55.574
Your voice...

843
01:11:55.783 --> 01:11:57.451
Don't you recognize it?

844
01:11:57.493 --> 01:12:00.079
After all the talks we had?

845
01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:02.706
After all the lies you've told me?

846
01:12:02.706 --> 01:12:04.666
Let me see your face.

847
01:12:04.875 --> 01:12:07.336
They say I'm theirs now.

848
01:12:08.045 --> 01:12:11.006
They say I'll never leave here.

849
01:12:11.632 --> 01:12:14.426
Your match is about to go out.

850
01:12:16.345 --> 01:12:18.555
Let me see your goddamn face now!

851
01:12:18.555 --> 01:12:19.556
Why?

852
01:12:19.556 --> 01:12:22.059
So you can lie to me more?

853
01:12:22.059 --> 01:12:24.478
- This isn't about the truth!
- Yes it is.

854
01:12:24.478 --> 01:12:28.315
- It's about exposing the truth.
- This is about you!

855
01:12:28.315 --> 01:12:29.900
And Laeddis.

856
01:12:31.068 --> 01:12:34.071
That's all it's ever been about.

857
01:12:34.071 --> 01:12:35.781
I was incidental.

858
01:12:36.865 --> 01:12:38.409
A way in.

859
01:12:41.036 --> 01:12:42.371
George?

860
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:44.248
George Noyce?

861
01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.627
No, it's not possible,
You can't be here.

862
01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:50.129
Do you like it?

863
01:12:51.755 --> 01:12:53.757
Who did this to you, George?

864
01:12:53.757 --> 01:12:55.134
You did!

865
01:12:55.592 --> 01:12:56.969
What the hell do you mean?

866
01:12:56.969 --> 01:12:59.096
What are you talking
all of your fucking talk

867
01:12:59.096 --> 01:13:01.557
And I'm back here because of you!

868
01:13:01.557 --> 01:13:03.892
George, I how did they get you out of Dedham.
Huh?

869
01:13:03.892 --> 01:13:07.271
However this happened, Im gonna
find a way to fix this. You understand me?

870
01:13:07.271 --> 01:13:08.689
I'll never get out now.

871
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:11.483
I got out once, But not twice, never twice.

872
01:13:11.483 --> 01:13:14.903
- Tell me how they got you here?
- They knew!

873
01:13:14.987 --> 01:13:16.280
Don't you get it?

874
01:13:16.572 --> 01:13:19.491
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

875
01:13:20.034 --> 01:13:22.494
This is a game. All of this...

876
01:13:22.953 --> 01:13:24.330
is for you.

877
01:13:24.496 --> 01:13:26.582
You're not investigating anything.

878
01:13:26.707 --> 01:13:30.419
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

879
01:13:30.586 --> 01:13:31.670
George...

880
01:13:32.087 --> 01:13:34.256
Gearge you're wrong.

881
01:13:34.882 --> 01:13:36.216
Really?

882
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:40.346
Been alone much since
you got here?

883
01:13:40.346 --> 01:13:42.514
I'm been with my partner.

884
01:13:42.556 --> 01:13:45.684
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

885
01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:47.519
He's a...

886
01:13:48.103 --> 01:13:50.397
US Marshal from Seattle.

887
01:13:50.397 --> 01:13:53.567
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

888
01:13:54.777 --> 01:13:56.070
George, look...

889
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:59.615
I know people.
I trust this man.

890
01:14:03.661 --> 01:14:06.330
Then, they've already won.

891
01:14:08.332 --> 01:14:13.337
Fuck!

892
01:14:13.712 --> 01:14:16.423
They're going to...

893
01:14:16.423 --> 01:14:18.968
take me to the lighthouse.

894
01:14:18.968 --> 01:14:21.637
They're going to
cut into my brain.

895
01:14:22.221 --> 01:14:26.058
And I'm only here because of you!

896
01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:30.729
George, I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse.

897
01:14:30.938 --> 01:14:31.689
You're not.

898
01:14:31.814 --> 01:14:34.733
You can't dig out the truth and
kill Laeddis at the same time.

899
01:14:34.775 --> 01:14:37.444
You've got to make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

900
01:14:38.278 --> 01:14:40.239
I'm not here to kill anyone.

901
01:14:40.364 --> 01:14:44.952
- Liar!
- I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ...

902
01:14:45.411 --> 01:14:47.579
She's dead.

903
01:14:47.913 --> 01:14:50.416
Let her go...

904
01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:51.834
Let her go.

905
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.877
Tell him Teddy...

906
01:14:54.878 --> 01:14:57.298
Tell him why.

907
01:14:59.258 --> 01:15:01.427
You've got to do it.
There's no other way.

908
01:15:02.052 --> 01:15:05.222
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day you brought me my locket...

909
01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:06.265
You've gotta do it!

910
01:15:06.432 --> 01:15:10.978
How I told you my heart was breaking.
And you asked me why?

911
01:15:10.978 --> 01:15:12.813
She's fucking with your head.

912
01:15:12.813 --> 01:15:16.150
And I told you
it was from happiness.

913
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:17.651
She'll kill you. She's going to kill you.

914
01:15:20.946 --> 01:15:24.783
You want to uncover the truth?
You've gotta let her go ...

915
01:15:25.034 --> 01:15:28.370
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

916
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:30.331
I can't!
I can't.

917
01:15:36.503 --> 01:15:39.924
Then you'll never leave
this island.

918
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.555
Dolores?

919
01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.148
He's not in this ward.

920
01:15:56.649 --> 01:15:58.609
He was transferred...

921
01:15:58.984 --> 01:16:00.402
Out of here.

922
01:16:02.196 --> 01:16:04.281
If he's not in ward A,

923
01:16:04.907 --> 01:16:07.952
there's only one place he can be

924
01:16:12.289 --> 01:16:14.166
The lighthouse.

925
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:22.758
Hey!

926
01:16:25.678 --> 01:16:27.054
God help you.

927
01:16:35.771 --> 01:16:38.607
Boss, we got problems.
McPherson and Cawley are in the building.

928
01:16:38.607 --> 01:16:41.443
They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,

929
01:16:41.443 --> 01:16:44.280
They're looking all over the place for him.
They're on the way to the roof.

930
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.656
Let's get the hell out of here.

931
01:16:45.656 --> 01:16:46.699
This way.

932
01:16:48.742 --> 01:16:51.912
Just keep going.
We belong here

933
01:17:01.171 --> 01:17:04.800
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

934
01:17:05.467 --> 01:17:07.219
Where were you?

935
01:17:07.219 --> 01:17:09.513
After we got that guy to the infirmary,

936
01:17:09.513 --> 01:17:11.807
I took a little detour
to patient records.

937
01:17:11.807 --> 01:17:13.434
Did you ever find Laeddis?

938
01:17:14.393 --> 01:17:15.477
No.

939
01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:18.689
- No. I never found him.
- Well I've got the next best thing.

940
01:17:18.689 --> 01:17:20.149
His intake form.

941
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:22.985
It was the only thing in his file.
No session notes. No incident reports.

942
01:17:22.985 --> 01:17:25.029
No photographs... just this.
It was weird.

943
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:26.864
Here, take a look.

944
01:17:27.656 --> 01:17:29.033
I'll look at it later.

945
01:17:30.993 --> 01:17:32.203
What's the matter, boss?

946
01:17:32.786 --> 01:17:35.247
I'll take a look at it later,
that's all.

947
01:17:37.541 --> 01:17:38.959
Ashecliffe's that way.

948
01:17:39.043 --> 01:17:40.920
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

949
01:17:42.338 --> 01:17:43.964
I'm going to the lighthouse.

950
01:17:44.798 --> 01:17:47.676
I'm going to find out what
the fuck is happening on this island.

951
01:18:01.065 --> 01:18:02.274
Here it is.

952
01:18:02.858 --> 01:18:04.068
Damn!

953
01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:07.029
We're too far South.
We're gonna have to double back.

954
01:18:07.571 --> 01:18:10.157
There's no way we could cross those rocks.

955
01:18:10.157 --> 01:18:12.993
There could be a way behind those trees.

956
01:18:12.993 --> 01:18:14.912
Maybe a path that goes around the rocks
that leads over to the lighthouse.

957
01:18:14.954 --> 01:18:17.915
What are we doing here?
We've got the intake form.

958
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:21.961
It proves there's a 67th patient...
which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.

959
01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:26.507
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
Do you understand?

960
01:18:29.134 --> 01:18:31.846
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

961
01:18:32.179 --> 01:18:33.264
Why would you want to Chuck?
Why?

962
01:18:33.305 --> 01:18:37.893
Because climbing down there
when it's dark is a thin step short to suicide. That's why.

963
01:18:37.893 --> 01:18:38.936
Okay.

964
01:18:39.103 --> 01:18:42.606
Maybe you better sit this one out then.

965
01:18:44.024 --> 01:18:47.778
You brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped here on this rock.

966
01:18:47.778 --> 01:18:48.737
On this island.

967
01:18:48.821 --> 01:18:52.700
Without no one to rely on but each other.
And now you're acting like.........

968
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.742
Like what? Like what?

969
01:18:53.784 --> 01:18:55.369
How am I acting?

970
01:18:59.248 --> 01:19:03.586
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

971
01:19:08.507 --> 01:19:13.846
- What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.

972
01:19:15.598 --> 01:19:17.099
Seattle?

973
01:19:21.645 --> 01:19:24.565
I'll going on...alone.

974
01:19:26.108 --> 01:19:27.735
I'm going with you, boss.

975
01:19:27.735 --> 01:19:29.403
I said alone.

976
01:19:31.155 --> 01:19:32.865
Fine.

977
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:59.725
Damn it!

978
01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:02.103
Damn it!

979
01:20:07.191 --> 01:20:10.402
I knew it wouldn't take long.
But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.

980
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:21.080
Chuck!

981
01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:24.834
Chuck!

982
01:21:26.771 --> 01:21:27.855
Come on!

983
01:22:02.848 --> 01:22:04.141
Chuck!

984
01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.310
Where are you, Chuck?

985
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.378
Chuck!

986
01:22:33.963 --> 01:22:35.506
Chuck!

987
01:23:19.884 --> 01:23:21.260
Who are you?

988
01:23:23.763 --> 01:23:25.181
I'm Teddy Daniels.

989
01:23:25.222 --> 01:23:26.307
I'm a cop.

990
01:23:27.516 --> 01:23:28.726
You're the marshal.

991
01:23:30.644 --> 01:23:31.854
That's right.

992
01:23:34.190 --> 01:23:35.274
Would you mind...

993
01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:38.194
taking your hand from behind
your back, please?

994
01:23:38.194 --> 01:23:39.236
Why?

995
01:23:39.528 --> 01:23:41.155
Why?!

996
01:23:41.697 --> 01:23:44.742
I want to make sure what you're
holding won't hurt me.

997
01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:53.209
I'm gonna keep this...

998
01:23:54.627 --> 01:23:56.003
If you don't mind.

999
01:23:57.254 --> 01:23:59.173
Fine by me.

1000
01:24:11.102 --> 01:24:12.311
You're Rachel Solando.

1001
01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.940
The real one.

1002
01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:21.278
Did you kill your children?

1003
01:24:23.072 --> 01:24:24.240
I never had children.

1004
01:24:25.992 --> 01:24:27.159
I was never married.

1005
01:24:29.203 --> 01:24:32.832
And before I was a patient
in Ashecliff, I worked here.

1006
01:24:34.834 --> 01:24:36.252
You were a nurse?

1007
01:24:37.962 --> 01:24:39.672
I was a doctor, marshal.

1008
01:24:43.634 --> 01:24:44.885
You think I'm crazy?

1009
01:24:45.386 --> 01:24:48.222
- No, I ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy ...

1010
01:24:48.723 --> 01:24:51.642
well that hardly helps, does it?

1011
01:24:52.893 --> 01:24:56.355
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1012
01:24:59.358 --> 01:25:00.651
People tell the world you're crazy

1013
01:25:01.444 --> 01:25:02.820
and all your protests to the contrary,

1014
01:25:03.321 --> 01:25:04.530
just confirms what they're saying.

1015
01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.869
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.

1016
01:25:10.077 --> 01:25:11.495
Once you are declared insane,

1017
01:25:12.371 --> 01:25:15.124
then anything you do is called
a part of that insanity.

1018
01:25:15.124 --> 01:25:17.960
Your reasonable protests
or denial.

1019
01:25:18.961 --> 01:25:21.172
Valid fears,
paranoia.

1020
01:25:21.172 --> 01:25:23.424
Survival instincts.

1021
01:25:23.966 --> 01:25:25.051
Defense mechanisms.

1022
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.512
You're smarter than you look marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1023
01:25:30.097 --> 01:25:31.098
Tell me something...

1024
01:25:31.265 --> 01:25:32.475
Yeah...

1025
01:25:34.393 --> 01:25:36.145
What happened to you?

1026
01:25:36.896 --> 01:25:39.732
I started asking about these large
shipments of sodium-anatol

1027
01:25:40.524 --> 01:25:43.694
- and opium-based hallucinogens.
- Psychotropic drugs.

1028
01:25:45.154 --> 01:25:46.572
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1029
01:25:49.909 --> 01:25:51.661
Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy?

1030
01:25:53.287 --> 01:25:54.997
They zap the patient with electroshocks,

1031
01:25:56.082 --> 01:26:00.127
then go through the eye with an ice pick

1032
01:26:01.087 --> 01:26:02.838
and pull out some nerve fibers.

1033
01:26:05.883 --> 01:26:07.343
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1034
01:26:08.219 --> 01:26:10.263
Tractable.

1035
01:26:11.013 --> 01:26:12.098
It's barbaric.

1036
01:26:13.516 --> 01:26:14.684
Unconscionable.

1037
01:26:15.893 --> 01:26:20.690
Do you know how pain enters the
body marshal? Do you?

1038
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.942
Depends on where you're hurt.

1039
01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:25.236
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1040
01:26:25.486 --> 01:26:27.238
The brain controls pain.

1041
01:26:28.322 --> 01:26:32.577
The brain controls fear, empathy,
sleep, hunger, anger... everything.

1042
01:26:35.121 --> 01:26:36.289
What If you could control it?

1043
01:26:37.456 --> 01:26:38.583
The brain?

1044
01:26:38.624 --> 01:26:40.293
Re-create a man,

1045
01:26:41.085 --> 01:26:42.879
so he doesn't feel pain,

1046
01:26:43.421 --> 01:26:45.631
or love, or sympathy.

1047
01:26:47.216 --> 01:26:51.637
A man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess.

1048
01:26:54.181 --> 01:26:56.267
You can never take away
all a man's memories.

1049
01:26:56.392 --> 01:26:57.768
Never.

1050
01:26:57.977 --> 01:27:01.522
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1051
01:27:02.023 --> 01:27:03.482
during their brainwashing experiments.

1052
01:27:03.774 --> 01:27:06.694
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they are doing here.

1053
01:27:07.445 --> 01:27:12.116
They're creating ghosts to go out in the world.
And do things sane men never do.

1054
01:27:12.116 --> 01:27:15.036
To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge.

1055
01:27:15.536 --> 01:27:17.121
That would take years.

1056
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:20.917
Years of research,
hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1057
01:27:22.877 --> 01:27:25.296
50 years from now,
people will look back

1058
01:27:25.379 --> 01:27:28.132
and say, "Here. This place
is where it all began."

1059
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:30.676
The Nazis used the Jews.

1060
01:27:30.968 --> 01:27:34.805
The Soviets used prisoners
in their own gulags, and we...

1061
01:27:35.181 --> 01:27:36.599
We tested patients,

1062
01:27:37.391 --> 01:27:38.559
on Shutter Island.

1063
01:27:39.852 --> 01:27:43.105
No, they won't ...
No

1064
01:27:46.317 --> 01:27:47.527
You do understand

1065
01:27:51.239 --> 01:27:53.407
That they can't let you leave?

1066
01:27:53.866 --> 01:27:54.951
I am a federal marshal ...

1067
01:27:55.701 --> 01:27:57.119
They can't stop me.

1068
01:27:58.538 --> 01:27:59.747
I was an esteemed psychiatrist,

1069
01:28:01.874 --> 01:28:04.335
from a respected family.

1070
01:28:05.294 --> 01:28:06.963
It didn't matter.

1071
01:28:09.632 --> 01:28:10.675
Let me ask you ...

1072
01:28:11.384 --> 01:28:13.135
any past traumas in your life?

1073
01:28:14.637 --> 01:28:19.517
Yes. Why? Why would that matter?

1074
01:28:19.809 --> 01:28:21.811
Because they can point to some
event in your past and say

1075
01:28:21.811 --> 01:28:24.397
it is the reason you lost your sanity

1076
01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:26.774
So that when they commit you here

1077
01:28:27.316 --> 01:28:31.237
your friends and colleagues will say,
"Of course he cracked."

1078
01:28:33.072 --> 01:28:34.490
"And who wouldn't have,
after what he'd been through."

1079
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:35.867
They can say that about anyone

1080
01:28:36.117 --> 01:28:39.245
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.

1081
01:28:42.915 --> 01:28:45.042
How's your head?

1082
01:28:46.085 --> 01:28:48.838
- My head?
- Any funny dreams lately?

1083
01:28:49.422 --> 01:28:53.759
Trouble sleeping? Headaches?

1084
01:28:55.136 --> 01:28:56.971
I am prone to migraines. Yes.

1085
01:28:56.971 --> 01:28:58.014
Jesus!

1086
01:29:00.725 --> 01:29:02.351
You haven't taken any pills, have you?

1087
01:29:03.186 --> 01:29:05.646
- I mean even aspirin?
- They hit the aspirin?

1088
01:29:05.646 --> 01:29:07.273
Jesus!

1089
01:29:07.482 --> 01:29:10.860
And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank
coffee they gave you.

1090
01:29:11.194 --> 01:29:13.529
You tell me at least that
you've been smoking your own cigarettes.

1091
01:29:16.115 --> 01:29:19.160
No... no.

1092
01:29:20.495 --> 01:29:21.829
No. I haven't.

1093
01:29:22.079 --> 01:29:24.749
It takes 36 to 48 hours for
neuroleptic narcotics

1094
01:29:24.832 --> 01:29:29.086
to reach workable levels in
the blood stream.

1095
01:29:29.086 --> 01:29:31.005
Palsy comes first

1096
01:29:32.006 --> 01:29:34.175
First the fingertips and then
eventually the whole hand.

1097
01:29:36.177 --> 01:29:40.515
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, marshal? Huh?

1098
01:29:42.934 --> 01:29:44.769
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse?

1099
01:29:46.521 --> 01:29:47.688
Tell me.

1100
01:29:48.898 --> 01:29:50.942
Brain surgery.

1101
01:29:51.609 --> 01:29:55.613
"Let's open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this" kind.

1102
01:29:56.072 --> 01:29:58.491
"We learned it from the Nazi's" kind.

1103
01:30:01.202 --> 01:30:03.037
It's where they create the ghosts.

1104
01:30:04.664 --> 01:30:06.707
Who knows about this?

1105
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.127
On the island I mean. Who?

1106
01:30:11.504 --> 01:30:12.922
Everyone.

1107
01:30:13.005 --> 01:30:16.551
Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1108
01:30:17.468 --> 01:30:20.054
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1109
01:30:38.948 --> 01:30:41.242
You can't stay here.

1110
01:30:41.659 --> 01:30:45.246
They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid
if they come looking for you, they might find me.

1111
01:30:46.164 --> 01:30:47.623
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1112
01:30:55.006 --> 01:30:56.632
I'm gonna come back for you.

1113
01:30:56.799 --> 01:30:59.844
I won't be here. I move during the day.
new places every night.

1114
01:30:59.844 --> 01:31:02.221
But I could come get you
off of this island.

1115
01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:04.474
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1116
01:31:05.016 --> 01:31:08.478
The only way off the island
is the ferry and they control it.

1117
01:31:08.978 --> 01:31:10.730
You'll never leave here.

1118
01:31:20.656 --> 01:31:22.075
I had a friend.

1119
01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:25.078
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1120
01:31:25.745 --> 01:31:27.413
Have you seen him?

1121
01:31:28.664 --> 01:31:30.333
Marshal...

1122
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:33.586
You have no friends.

1123
01:32:06.244 --> 01:32:08.538
There you are.

1124
01:32:10.373 --> 01:32:12.917
We've been wondering when
you'd show up.

1125
01:32:14.752 --> 01:32:16.212
Have a seat.

1126
01:32:16.754 --> 01:32:18.089
Come on.

1127
01:32:29.017 --> 01:32:31.477
Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we?

1128
01:32:32.603 --> 01:32:34.147
I was just...

1129
01:32:34.856 --> 01:32:36.232
just looking around.

1130
01:32:38.901 --> 01:32:41.070
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

1131
01:32:42.655 --> 01:32:44.824
- What?
- God's gift.

1132
01:32:46.325 --> 01:32:47.910
The violence.

1133
01:32:52.749 --> 01:32:56.336
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1134
01:32:57.253 --> 01:32:59.422
it reached down for me like a divine hand.

1135
01:33:01.007 --> 01:33:02.800
God loves violence.

1136
01:33:05.887 --> 01:33:08.681
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1137
01:33:09.265 --> 01:33:11.100
Why else would there be so much of it?

1138
01:33:11.851 --> 01:33:13.353
It's in us.

1139
01:33:13.519 --> 01:33:14.812
It's what we are.

1140
01:33:16.564 --> 01:33:19.984
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,
we pillage and plunder

1141
01:33:19.984 --> 01:33:21.653
and tear at the flesh
of our brothers

1142
01:33:21.653 --> 01:33:25.782
and why? Because God gave us violence
to wage in his honor.

1143
01:33:28.951 --> 01:33:31.245
I thought God gave us moral order.

1144
01:33:31.245 --> 01:33:34.082
There is no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1145
01:33:34.874 --> 01:33:37.043
There's no moral order at all.

1146
01:33:37.418 --> 01:33:41.214
There's just this:
can my violence conquer yours?

1147
01:33:46.678 --> 01:33:48.638
- I'm not violent.
- Yes you are.

1148
01:33:50.223 --> 01:33:52.183
You're as violent as they come.

1149
01:33:53.226 --> 01:33:56.187
I know this because I'm as violent as they come.

1150
01:33:57.230 --> 01:33:59.148
With the constraints of society,
we are lifted and

1151
01:33:59.399 --> 01:34:04.612
If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you
would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.

1152
01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.866
Wouldn't you?

1153
01:34:11.577 --> 01:34:15.540
Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be
controlled, but I know different.

1154
01:34:16.582 --> 01:34:20.837
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do. Oh I know you.

1155
01:34:21.713 --> 01:34:23.965
We've known each other for centuries.

1156
01:34:33.808 --> 01:34:36.561
If I was to sink my teeth into your eye
right now,

1157
01:34:36.561 --> 01:34:40.023
would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?

1158
01:34:44.027 --> 01:34:45.695
Give it a try.

1159
01:34:47.155 --> 01:34:51.534
That's the spirit.

1160
01:35:36.412 --> 01:35:37.997
Where have you been?

1161
01:35:39.123 --> 01:35:41.376
Wandering, just looking at your island.

1162
01:35:41.417 --> 01:35:45.880
Oh I forgot. You're leaving.
Now that Rachel has been found.

1163
01:35:46.214 --> 01:35:47.715
Sure. Yeah.

1164
01:35:49.968 --> 01:35:51.261
Big meeting?

1165
01:35:51.844 --> 01:35:54.430
Oh, yes ...

1166
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:57.100
Apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward C yesterday

1167
01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:00.728
He subdued a highly dangerous patient.
Quite handily.

1168
01:36:01.854 --> 01:36:02.939
Is that so?

1169
01:36:03.022 --> 01:36:07.777
It seems he had a long conversation with a
paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

1170
01:36:10.738 --> 01:36:13.741
This Noyce,
you said his name was,

1171
01:36:14.576 --> 01:36:17.787
- he's delusional?
- Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1172
01:36:17.787 --> 01:36:20.957
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient
got so wound up

1173
01:36:20.957 --> 01:36:25.044
by one of Noyce's stories
that he beat him up.

1174
01:36:25.211 --> 01:36:26.838
Cigarette?

1175
01:36:28.214 --> 01:36:30.091
Oh. No, thanks.
I quit.

1176
01:36:31.676 --> 01:36:33.845
So, you're taking the ferry?

1177
01:36:34.387 --> 01:36:35.805
Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh...

1178
01:36:36.472 --> 01:36:38.349
I think we've gotten
all we came here for so.

1179
01:36:39.183 --> 01:36:40.393
"We" marshal?

1180
01:36:42.604 --> 01:36:44.397
Speaking of which. Have you

1181
01:36:44.814 --> 01:36:47.317
- seen him, Doctor?
- Who?

1182
01:36:48.151 --> 01:36:49.819
My partner, Chuck.

1183
01:36:52.530 --> 01:36:54.616
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1184
01:36:57.118 --> 01:36:59.746
You know, I've built something valuable here.

1185
01:36:59.746 --> 01:37:03.374
And valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1186
01:37:03.374 --> 01:37:05.418
Everyone wants a quick fix,
they always have.

1187
01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:09.130
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1188
01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:11.716
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1189
01:37:13.051 --> 01:37:15.720
I can see that...

1190
01:37:19.432 --> 01:37:21.392
So tell me again
about your partner.

1191
01:37:23.269 --> 01:37:25.271
What partner?

1192
01:38:30.253 --> 01:38:32.005
Marshal...

1193
01:38:33.298 --> 01:38:34.799
Going somewhere?

1194
01:38:35.258 --> 01:38:39.053
No. Just heading out
to the ferry. So...

1195
01:38:40.597 --> 01:38:42.307
I'm afraid it's the other way.

1196
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:47.270
If you wait a moment,

1197
01:38:47.770 --> 01:38:50.857
I'll find someone who can take you
to the dock.

1198
01:38:54.569 --> 01:38:57.155
What is this, doctor?

1199
01:38:57.155 --> 01:38:59.782
It's just a sedative.

1200
01:38:59.782 --> 01:39:02.494
- It's for precaution.
- Precaution?

1201
01:39:04.913 --> 01:39:09.334
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1202
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:11.085
You think you deserve it?

1203
01:39:11.544 --> 01:39:14.506
For what?
For provoking you?

1204
01:39:14.923 --> 01:39:17.592
and, forgive me,
what doesn't provoke you?

1205
01:39:17.926 --> 01:39:19.135
Remarks...

1206
01:39:19.511 --> 01:39:20.970
- Words...
- Nazis!

1207
01:39:21.805 --> 01:39:23.431
Well that, too.

1208
01:39:23.890 --> 01:39:25.725
And of course, memories, dreams...

1209
01:39:26.893 --> 01:39:31.147
Did you know that the word "trauma" comes
from the Greek for "wound"?

1210
01:39:31.481 --> 01:39:35.777
And what is the German word for "dream"
"Traum".

1211
01:39:35.777 --> 01:39:36.945
Traum.

1212
01:39:38.279 --> 01:39:41.199
Wounds can create monsters.

1213
01:39:41.407 --> 01:39:44.119
And you ...
you are wounded, marshal.

1214
01:39:45.036 --> 01:39:48.081
Wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster

1215
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:50.333
you must stop it?

1216
01:39:53.378 --> 01:39:55.547
- I agree.
- Yes...

1217
01:40:42.093 --> 01:40:43.928
What are you doing, baby?

1218
01:40:49.184 --> 01:40:50.894
You've got to get to the ferry.

1219
01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:53.772
No. No.
No.

1220
01:40:57.859 --> 01:41:01.946
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he is perfect for their experiments.

1221
01:41:02.447 --> 01:41:05.116
There's only one place they'd take him.

1222
01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:10.246
You go there and you'll die.

1223
01:41:10.246 --> 01:41:14.417
He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are
holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out.

1224
01:41:14.626 --> 01:41:16.795
I can't lose anyone else.

1225
01:41:17.379 --> 01:41:21.716
Don't go, Teddy.
Please don't do this. Don't go.

1226
01:41:24.552 --> 01:41:26.596
I'm sorry, honey.

1227
01:41:28.306 --> 01:41:31.101
I love this thing because
you gave it to me

1228
01:41:33.812 --> 01:41:35.897
But the truth is ...

1229
01:41:35.897 --> 01:41:39.067
it's one fucking ugly tie.

1230
01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:20.608
No!

1231
01:43:42.399 --> 01:43:44.359
Don't move!
Stay where you are!

1232
01:43:45.944 --> 01:43:47.696
Are you going to kill me?

1233
01:43:48.029 --> 01:43:52.325
No.
I'm not gonna kill you.

1234
01:45:44.354 --> 01:45:47.357
Why are you all wet, baby?

1235
01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.027
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1236
01:46:04.374 --> 01:46:06.960
The rifle's empty by the way.

1237
01:46:12.507 --> 01:46:14.467
Have a seat.

1238
01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:24.519
For god's sake dry off
you're going to catch a cold.

1239
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.605
Alright.

1240
01:46:29.274 --> 01:46:32.193
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1241
01:46:34.779 --> 01:46:37.115
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1242
01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:41.536
Yes. He's here.

1243
01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:45.207
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up.

1244
01:46:46.791 --> 01:46:48.752
So, Dr. Shehan...

1245
01:46:49.294 --> 01:46:50.629
He came on the ferry
this morning, huh?

1246
01:46:51.630 --> 01:46:52.714
Not exactly.

1247
01:46:54.466 --> 01:46:57.135
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1248
01:46:58.428 --> 01:47:00.222
Sorry to hear about that.

1249
01:47:03.642 --> 01:47:05.310
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1250
01:47:06.645 --> 01:47:07.812
How are the hallucinations?

1251
01:47:08.813 --> 01:47:10.357
Get out of here, Teddy.

1252
01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:13.485
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1253
01:47:16.488 --> 01:47:19.366
- Not bad.
- They'll get worse.

1254
01:47:19.783 --> 01:47:20.909
I know.

1255
01:47:21.785 --> 01:47:23.286
Dr. Solando...

1256
01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:26.748
she told me about neuroleptics.

1257
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:30.252
Did she now?
And when was this?

1258
01:47:30.252 --> 01:47:35.340
I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs.
But you'll never get to her.

1259
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.008
I don't doubt it.

1260
01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.469
Considering she's not real.

1261
01:47:40.971 --> 01:47:43.598
But your hallucinations are
more severe than I thought.

1262
01:47:45.016 --> 01:47:47.102
You are not on neuroleptics.

1263
01:47:48.061 --> 01:47:50.480
You are not on anything
as a matter of fact.

1264
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.983
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?

1265
01:47:52.983 --> 01:47:54.067
Withdrawal.

1266
01:47:54.317 --> 01:47:55.652
Withdrawal?

1267
01:47:56.027 --> 01:47:58.947
From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned
drink since I've been on this island.

1268
01:47:58.989 --> 01:48:00.365
Chlorpromazine.

1269
01:48:00.699 --> 01:48:04.619
I'm not a fan of pharmacology
but I have to say in your case ...

1270
01:48:05.412 --> 01:48:07.873
- Clorpro... what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1271
01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:13.295
The same thing we've been
giving you for the past 24 months.

1272
01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:15.964
So for the past two years

1273
01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:19.843
you've had somebody slipping
me drugs in Boston. Is that it?

1274
01:48:19.843 --> 01:48:22.304
Not Boston.
Here.

1275
01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:27.934
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1276
01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.774
After everything I've seen here, doctor,

1277
01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:37.736
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1278
01:48:37.736 --> 01:48:42.324
Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday?
I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake.

1279
01:48:42.657 --> 01:48:46.536
You were a U.S. marshal.
Here's a copy of the intake form.

1280
01:48:46.536 --> 01:48:49.998
You broke into ward C for
proof of the 67th patient

1281
01:48:49.998 --> 01:48:53.126
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,
you could have blown the lid off this place.

1282
01:48:53.543 --> 01:48:54.920
- Wait... wait.
- But somehow

1283
01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:56.838
you couldn't find time
to look at it. Well read it now.

1284
01:48:58.006 --> 01:48:59.299
Go ahead.

1285
01:49:03.094 --> 01:49:05.388
The patient is highly intelligent,
highly delusional.

1286
01:49:05.388 --> 01:49:06.973
Decorated army veteran.

1287
01:49:07.474 --> 01:49:09.976
Present for the liberation of Dachau.

1288
01:49:10.894 --> 01:49:12.646
Former U.S. marshal.

1289
01:49:12.813 --> 01:49:13.897
Known proclivity for violence.

1290
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.816
Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies

1291
01:49:15.816 --> 01:49:19.319
that the crime ever took place.
Highly developed and fantastical

1292
01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:22.739
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions.

1293
01:49:22.739 --> 01:49:23.949
I've had enough of this bullshit.

1294
01:49:23.949 --> 01:49:25.408
Where's my partner, huh?

1295
01:49:25.450 --> 01:49:27.077
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1296
01:49:27.911 --> 01:49:29.371
Let's try this another way.

1297
01:49:29.746 --> 01:49:32.457
Your wife's maiden name was
"Chanal". Am I correct?

1298
01:49:32.457 --> 01:49:35.168
- Don't you even talk about her!
- I'm afraid I have to.

1299
01:49:36.837 --> 01:49:39.965
Notice anything these four names have in common?

1300
01:49:40.382 --> 01:49:41.550
Your rule of 4.

1301
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:44.636
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you have done anything

1302
01:49:44.636 --> 01:49:48.974
- to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

1303
01:49:49.558 --> 01:49:52.144
The names ...
have the same letters.

1304
01:49:52.144 --> 01:49:54.771
Edward Daniels has exactly the same
13 letters

1305
01:49:54.771 --> 01:49:57.399
as Andrew Laeddis.
The same as Rachel Solando

1306
01:49:57.399 --> 01:49:59.109
and Dolores Chanal.

1307
01:49:59.234 --> 01:50:00.819
- The names are anagrams for each other.

1308
01:50:01.236 --> 01:50:04.489
Your tactics, they're not going to work on me.

1309
01:50:04.489 --> 01:50:06.992
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

1310
01:50:07.075 --> 01:50:08.827
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1311
01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:12.998
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1312
01:50:14.499 --> 01:50:15.333
Bullshit.

1313
01:50:15.333 --> 01:50:17.961
You were committed here by
court order 24 months ago.

1314
01:50:17.961 --> 01:50:21.339
Your crime is terrible.
One you can't forgive yourself for.

1315
01:50:21.339 --> 01:50:23.258
So you invented another self.

1316
01:50:28.263 --> 01:50:29.473
Let's get down to the facts.

1317
01:50:29.973 --> 01:50:33.769
You've created a story in which
you're not a murderer, you are hero.

1318
01:50:33.977 --> 01:50:34.895
Still a U.S marshal.

1319
01:50:35.479 --> 01:50:37.564
Only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case

1320
01:50:37.773 --> 01:50:39.191
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1321
01:50:39.566 --> 01:50:42.152
so that anything we tell you about
who you are, what you've done

1322
01:50:42.694 --> 01:50:44.613
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1323
01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:46.114
My name is Edward Daniels.

1324
01:50:46.239 --> 01:50:50.160
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1325
01:50:50.368 --> 01:50:52.996
Patient 67. The storm.
Rachel Solando.

1326
01:50:52.996 --> 01:50:55.624
Your missing partner.
The dreams you have every night.

1327
01:50:55.624 --> 01:50:58.210
You were at Dachau,
But you may not have killed any guards.

1328
01:51:02.214 --> 01:51:05.342
I wish I could let you just
live in your fantasy world.

1329
01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:07.052
I really do.

1330
01:51:07.511 --> 01:51:12.557
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.

1331
01:51:12.724 --> 01:51:15.352
You've injured orderlies. Guards.
Other patients.

1332
01:51:15.352 --> 01:51:17.979
Two weeks ago
you attacked George Noyce.

1333
01:51:17.979 --> 01:51:19.564
No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor!

1334
01:51:19.731 --> 01:51:21.691
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't.

1335
01:51:21.817 --> 01:51:23.985
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him.

1336
01:51:24.027 --> 01:51:25.987
Because he called you Laeddis

1337
01:51:25.987 --> 01:51:28.365
and you do anything not to be him.

1338
01:51:29.658 --> 01:51:32.285
I have a transcript of that conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1339
01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:36.832
This is about you and Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about

1340
01:51:38.834 --> 01:51:41.461
No. No. He is saying that it's about
"me and Laeddis".

1341
01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:44.089
When you've asked him what happened
to his face,

1342
01:51:44.089 --> 01:51:46.550
said, and I quote again,
"You did this".

1343
01:51:47.008 --> 01:51:50.679
- No. He meant it was my fault he...
- You almost killed him.

1344
01:51:53.014 --> 01:51:56.977
The warden and the board of overseers
are determined something be done. It's been decided.

1345
01:51:57.728 --> 01:52:01.940
That unless, we can bring you back
to sanity now, right now,

1346
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:05.569
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1347
01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:11.700
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.

1348
01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:13.243
Do you understand?

1349
01:52:17.205 --> 01:52:18.540
Yeah, I understand.

1350
01:52:19.416 --> 01:52:21.460
I understand just fine.

1351
01:52:22.627 --> 01:52:26.715
If... if I don't play along
with your little game here.

1352
01:52:26.715 --> 01:52:29.468
Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts.

1353
01:52:29.468 --> 01:52:31.094
What about my partner?

1354
01:52:31.762 --> 01:52:36.224
You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1355
01:52:38.143 --> 01:52:39.436
Hello, boss.

1356
01:52:57.579 --> 01:53:01.124
What the fuck is going on here?

1357
01:53:04.169 --> 01:53:05.837
You working for him?

1358
01:53:06.254 --> 01:53:11.635
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.
Someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe.

1359
01:53:13.595 --> 01:53:15.555
You've been watching me, huh?

1360
01:53:16.223 --> 01:53:18.183
Watching me every minute.

1361
01:53:19.977 --> 01:53:21.395
Who... who are you?

1362
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:23.146
Who are you?
Tell me.

1363
01:53:23.647 --> 01:53:25.482
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1364
01:53:27.275 --> 01:53:29.987
I've been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1365
01:53:31.238 --> 01:53:32.739
I am Lester Sheehan.

1366
01:53:38.954 --> 01:53:41.581
And I told you about my wife ...

1367
01:53:41.665 --> 01:53:44.918
- I know.
- I climbed down a cliff to get you.

1368
01:53:45.168 --> 01:53:49.715
I trusted you. I risked everything
to come in here after you. Everything!

1369
01:53:49.715 --> 01:53:50.841
I know, boss.

1370
01:53:50.841 --> 01:53:52.592
We're running out of time here, Andrew,

1371
01:53:53.969 --> 01:53:56.596
I swore before the board of
overseers that I could construct

1372
01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:59.224
the most radical, cutting edge role-play

1373
01:53:59.224 --> 01:54:01.852
ever attempted in psychiatry and
it would bring you back.

1374
01:54:01.852 --> 01:54:04.521
I thought if we let you play this out

1375
01:54:05.188 --> 01:54:08.317
we could get you to see how
untrue, how impossible it is.

1376
01:54:09.651 --> 01:54:11.361
You've had to run of the place for two days.

1377
01:54:12.029 --> 01:54:14.990
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?

1378
01:54:15.824 --> 01:54:17.659
The satanic O.R.'s?

1379
01:54:30.839 --> 01:54:32.591
Andrew, listen to me.

1380
01:54:34.968 --> 01:54:36.637
If we fail with you

1381
01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:40.223
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited.

1382
01:54:40.223 --> 01:54:41.433
Everything.

1383
01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:46.146
We are on the front line of a war here, old boy.

1384
01:54:47.648 --> 01:54:50.150
And right now, it'll come down to you.

1385
01:54:57.032 --> 01:54:59.201
Don't move! Don't move!

1386
01:54:59.201 --> 01:55:02.454
- Andrew, no!
- My name is Edward Daniels.

1387
01:55:03.288 --> 01:55:06.208
This one is loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1388
01:55:06.208 --> 01:55:08.377
I see. And that's your firearm marshal?
You're sure?

1389
01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:10.462
My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the
barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1390
01:55:10.462 --> 01:55:14.800
You're not going to fuck with my mind on this
one Doc

1391
01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.011
Then blast away, because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island.

1392
01:55:24.768 --> 01:55:26.311
Andrew, please don't.

1393
01:55:37.447 --> 01:55:38.532
My gun...

1394
01:55:45.664 --> 01:55:47.332
What have you done to
my Goddamn gun.

1395
01:55:48.375 --> 01:55:50.002
It's a toy, Andrew.

1396
01:55:52.754 --> 01:55:54.423
We're telling you the truth.

1397
01:55:55.882 --> 01:55:59.386
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.
Suicidal.

1398
01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:02.973
You drank. Stayed away.
Ignored what everyone had told you.

1399
01:56:02.973 --> 01:56:06.101
You moved to that lake house after
she, purposely,

1400
01:56:06.101 --> 01:56:08.854
set your city apartment on fire

1401
01:56:08.896 --> 01:56:10.689
Andrew! Andrew!
Stop it!

1402
01:56:12.941 --> 01:56:14.026
You're lying...

1403
01:56:14.484 --> 01:56:16.278
Andrew, your children.

1404
01:56:17.112 --> 01:56:18.363
Simon...

1405
01:56:19.281 --> 01:56:22.075
- Henry...
- I didn't have any children.

1406
01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.702
Your wife drowned them.

1407
01:56:24.077 --> 01:56:26.747
At the cabin by the lake.

1408
01:56:26.788 --> 01:56:29.041
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1409
01:56:29.625 --> 01:56:30.792
every night.

1410
01:56:31.501 --> 01:56:32.753
I never had a little girl.

1411
01:56:32.753 --> 01:56:36.882
The one who tells you over and over that
you should have saved her

1412
01:56:36.882 --> 01:56:38.091
Saved them all.

1413
01:56:38.675 --> 01:56:39.885
Your daughter...

1414
01:56:40.344 --> 01:56:43.472
Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1415
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.807
Andrew, are you?

1416
01:57:09.122 --> 01:57:10.666
I'm so sorry, baby...

1417
01:57:15.170 --> 01:57:17.172
I told you not to come in here.

1418
01:57:17.714 --> 01:57:19.091
I told you...

1419
01:57:19.925 --> 01:57:22.386
this would be the end of you.

1420
01:57:42.823 --> 01:57:43.740
I'm back.

1421
01:57:45.075 --> 01:57:49.204
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.
Must of stopped ten places

1422
01:57:49.246 --> 01:57:51.248
in between here and Tulsa.
I could sleep for a week.

1423
01:57:56.295 --> 01:57:57.129
Dolores?

1424
01:58:04.219 --> 01:58:06.054
Dolores?

1425
01:58:13.061 --> 01:58:14.021
Dolores?

1426
01:58:28.535 --> 01:58:29.411
Dolores?

1427
01:58:54.728 --> 01:58:56.021
Baby...

1428
01:58:58.190 --> 01:58:59.691
Why are you all wet?

1429
01:59:02.528 --> 01:59:04.071
I missed you.

1430
01:59:10.911 --> 01:59:14.164
I want to go home.

1431
01:59:16.583 --> 01:59:17.459
You are home!

1432
01:59:23.298 --> 01:59:24.383
Where are the kids?

1433
01:59:28.679 --> 01:59:31.181
They're in school.

1434
01:59:34.893 --> 01:59:37.062
It's Saturday, honey.

1435
01:59:37.479 --> 01:59:39.523
School's not in on Saturday.

1436
01:59:42.568 --> 01:59:44.111
My school is.

1437
01:59:57.458 --> 01:59:59.668
Oh my God!

1438
02:00:02.045 --> 02:00:03.464
My God!

1439
02:00:17.936 --> 02:00:19.938
God!

1440
02:00:22.649 --> 02:00:26.278
Oh my God, no!

1441
02:00:28.947 --> 02:00:30.699
Come on!
Come on!

1442
02:00:48.842 --> 02:00:51.428
Please, God, no.

1443
02:00:51.428 --> 02:00:55.265
No!

1444
02:00:55.933 --> 02:00:57.226
No!

1445
02:01:02.856 --> 02:01:04.066
No!

1446
02:01:06.610 --> 02:01:07.611
No!

1447
02:02:11.467 --> 02:02:13.969
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1448
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.222
We'll dry them off...

1449
02:02:17.681 --> 02:02:19.391
We'll change their clothes...

1450
02:02:21.185 --> 02:02:24.688
They'll be our living dolls.

1451
02:02:27.566 --> 02:02:29.234
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1452
02:02:36.033 --> 02:02:37.701
If you ever loved me, Dolores...

1453
02:02:38.118 --> 02:02:39.995
Please stop talking.

1454
02:02:45.584 --> 02:02:48.337
I love you.

1455
02:02:56.887 --> 02:02:58.639
Set me free!

1456
02:03:04.186 --> 02:03:05.145
Baby...

1457
02:03:06.855 --> 02:03:09.692
We'll give them baths...

1458
02:03:17.032 --> 02:03:19.159
- I love you so much, Dolores.
- And I love you. I love you.

1459
02:03:50.441 --> 02:03:52.860
Andrew...

1460
02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.071
Andrew, can you hear me?

1461
02:03:57.865 --> 02:04:01.160
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel...

1462
02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.204
Rachel.

1463
02:04:06.624 --> 02:04:08.292
Rachel who?

1464
02:04:12.004 --> 02:04:13.088
Rachel Laeddis...

1465
02:04:14.715 --> 02:04:15.924
My daughter.

1466
02:04:19.803 --> 02:04:21.472
Why are you here?

1467
02:04:24.892 --> 02:04:26.644
Because I killed my wife.

1468
02:04:26.852 --> 02:04:28.228
and why did you do that?

1469
02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:36.195
Because she murdered our children.

1470
02:04:37.321 --> 02:04:40.157
And she told me to let her go.

1471
02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.665
- Who is Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1472
02:04:48.624 --> 02:04:50.584
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1473
02:04:51.252 --> 02:04:53.087
Why?

1474
02:04:53.837 --> 02:04:56.340
We need to hear you say it.

1475
02:05:02.221 --> 02:05:05.349
After she tried to kill
herself the first time,

1476
02:05:06.809 --> 02:05:08.143
Dolores told me she...

1477
02:05:09.728 --> 02:05:11.480
she had an insect...

1478
02:05:13.107 --> 02:05:14.525
living inside her brain.

1479
02:05:16.151 --> 02:05:16.986
She could feel it...

1480
02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.532
clicking across
her skull...

1481
02:05:23.659 --> 02:05:26.370
pulling the wires,
just for fun.

1482
02:05:28.872 --> 02:05:31.166
She told me that.

1483
02:05:32.001 --> 02:05:34.211
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1484
02:05:39.592 --> 02:05:41.427
I loved her so much.

1485
02:05:42.761 --> 02:05:44.221
Why did you make them up?

1486
02:05:46.557 --> 02:05:50.060
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1487
02:05:58.193 --> 02:06:02.406
I killed them, because
I didn't get her help.

1488
02:06:06.785 --> 02:06:09.997
I killed them...

1489
02:06:13.626 --> 02:06:17.838
Here's my theory, Andrew.
We broke through once before,

1490
02:06:17.838 --> 02:06:20.841
nine months ago,
and then you regressed.

1491
02:06:22.551 --> 02:06:25.971
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1492
02:06:27.014 --> 02:06:30.351
You reset, Andrew.
Like a tape playing

1493
02:06:30.351 --> 02:06:34.813
over and over on an endless loop.

1494
02:06:34.855 --> 02:06:37.942
I hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from ever happening again

1495
02:06:37.942 --> 02:06:40.569
But I need to know ...

1496
02:06:40.569 --> 02:06:43.280
you have accepted reality.

1497
02:06:49.578 --> 02:06:52.831
You came after me, huh, doctor?

1498
02:06:55.668 --> 02:06:58.712
You tried to help me when no one else would.

1499
02:07:10.558 --> 02:07:13.185
My name is Andrew Laeddis...

1500
02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:23.904
And I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1501
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:50.472
How we doing this morning?

1502
02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:52.558
Good.
And You?

1503
02:07:52.641 --> 02:07:54.852
Can't complain.

1504
02:08:03.611 --> 02:08:05.362
So what's our next move?

1505
02:08:06.071 --> 02:08:07.531
You tell me.

1506
02:08:13.162 --> 02:08:14.914
I've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.

1507
02:08:17.333 --> 02:08:20.920
Get back to the mainland. Whatever the
hell is going on here. It's bad.

1508
02:08:42.233 --> 02:08:44.527
Don't worry, partner.
They're not gonna catch us.

1509
02:08:51.492 --> 02:08:53.202
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1510
02:08:55.246 --> 02:08:56.497
Yeah, we are.
Aren't we?

1511
02:09:13.222 --> 02:09:15.599
You know this place makes
me wonder.

1512
02:09:16.517 --> 02:09:17.977
Yeah? What's that boss?

1513
02:09:19.478 --> 02:09:20.604
Which would be worse?

1514
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:24.233
To live as a monster ...

1515
02:09:24.859 --> 02:09:27.319
or to die as a good man.

1516
02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:38.205
Teddy?
