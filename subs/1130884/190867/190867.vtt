{1810}{2000}"The Untouchables"|gangster film, USA, 1987
{4092}{4220}1930. Prohibition has transformed|Chicago into a City at War.
{4222}{4400}Rival gangs complete for control|of the city's billion dollar empire
{4402}{4600}of illegal alcohol, enforcing their will|with the hand grenade and tommy gun.
{4602}{4700}It is the time of the Ganglords.|It is the time of Al Capone.
{4828}{4914}An article, which I believe appeared|in a newspaper, asked why,
{4919}{5022}since it would seem that you are|in effect the Mayor of Chicago,
{5027}{5135}you're not simply being|appointed to that position.
{5208}{5316}Well, I tell ya, it's touching.|Like a lot of things in life,
{5321}{5425}we laugh because it's funny,|and we laugh because it's true.
{5430}{5477}Some people say,|reformers here say:
{5482}{5577}"Put that man in jail,|what does he think he is doing?"
{5582}{5665}What I hope I'm doing, and here's|where your paper's got a point,
{5670}{5725}is I'm responding to|the will of the people.
{5796}{5906}People are gonna drink. We all|know that. All I do is act on that.
{5911}{5978}And all this talk of bootlegging.|What is bootlegging?
{5983}{6074}On the boat it's bootlegging,|on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.
{6079}{6133}I'm a businessman.
{6170}{6258}Your reputation is that you control|your business through violence.
{6263}{6374}That those that don't purchase your|product are dealt with violently.
{6505}{6554}It's all right.
{6589}{6635}I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.
{6640}{6708}We used to say, "You can get further|with a kind word and a gun"
{6713}{6787}"than you can|with just a kind word."
{6819}{6873}And in that neighbourhood|it might've been true.
{6878}{6964}And sometimes|your reputation follows you.
{6997}{7064}There is violence in Chicago,|but not by me
{7069}{7172}and not by anybody I employ.|Because it's not good business.
{7915}{8023}Leave us alone down here,|we've got everything we need.
{8028}{8100}The green beer you're peddlin'|ain't any good.
{8105}{8206}It's not supposed to be good.|It's supposed to be bought.
{8234}{8300}I'm not buyin' any.
{8350}{8445}Don't worry about it, Pops,|we won't come back.
{8519}{8590}- How's everyone at your house today?|- They're fine.
{8595}{8692}- Is your Mama well?|- She has a little cold.
{8698}{8750}Oh, she does?
{8778}{8855}- I'm sorry to hear that.|- But she'll be all right.
{8996}{9037}- There you go.|- Thank you.
{9042}{9169}That's all right, sweetie.|You be careful crossin' the street.
{9175}{9232}- Mister!|- You tell your Mama that...
{9237}{9298}Hey, Mister! Wait!
{9303}{9384}Mister! Wait!|You forgot your brief...
{10951}{11056}Yes, I heard it on the radio.
{11061}{11118}I know.
{11124}{11201}Now it's time to go to work.
{11394}{11472}You'll make a good first impression.
{11666}{11732}I love you, Eliot.
{11862}{11893}Now, shoo.
{11937}{12071}Eliot Ness, Special Agent|of the Treasury Department.
{12077}{12136}- Mr Ness.|- Thank you, Chief.
{12142}{12221}At the request|of the City of Chicago,
{12227}{12316}the Department of the Treasury|has inaugurated a programme
{12322}{12406}to deal with the flow of illegal|liquor and the violence it creates.
{12412}{12502}Mr Ness!|Of what does this programme consist?
{12508}{12576}I and other agents of the Treasury|will be working
{12581}{12629}with the Chicago Police...
{12635}{12687}Isn't it just another|showpiece programme?
{12693}{12792}- What do you think of prohibition?|- Do you drink, Mr Ness?
{12798}{12890}- Come on, answer the questions.|- It's not just a showpiece.
{12896}{12972}And I'll tell you|how I feel about prohibition.
{12978}{13011}It is the law of the land.
{13017}{13083}Do you consider yourself|a crusader, is that it?
{13088}{13143}What qualifications|do you have for the job?
{13149}{13205}Do you have any political ambitions?
{13211}{13275}All right, boys,|I think that's enough.
{13334}{13410}What are your real plans?|What have you got coming up?
{13416}{13465}You'll have to read about it|in the paper.
{13471}{13558}- Let me ride along with you.|- No. Can't help you.
{13564}{13641}Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,|the Flying Squad.
{13647}{13717}Are you ready to meet the men?
{13751}{13799}Yes, I am.
{14035}{14106}I have one more thing to say.
{14198}{14277}I know that many of you take a drink.
{14283}{14375}What you've done before today|is not my concern.
{14381}{14465}But now we must be pure,|and I want you to stop.
{14499}{14604}It's not a question of whether it's|'a harmless drink'. It may well be.
{14610}{14647}But it's against the law.
{14653}{14754}And as we are going to enforce|the law, we must do first by example.
{14870}{14931}Are there any questions?
{14965}{15045}Good. The Department|of the Treasury's had
{15051}{15101}a man undercover here|for some time now.
{15107}{15155}We've received word|from this informant
{15161}{15244}that a large shipment of Canadian|whiskey has arrived in Chicago.
{15250}{15314}So I hope that you have signed on|for some action.
{15508}{15619}Remember, the liquor cases|are marked with the red maple leaf.
{15624}{15702}The Treasury Agent is|in a grey suit with a white scarf.
{15707}{15816}- He is not to be arrested.|- A grey suit and a white scarf.
{15822}{15927}- That's it. Are your men ready?|- Yes, sir. They are.
{16093}{16176}- At ease.|- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
{16327}{16388}- How are we doin'?|- Okay.
{16530}{16615}- Want part of a sandwich?|- No, thank you, sir.
{16771}{16835}- You nervous?|- No, sir.
{16884}{16974}- Been with the unit long?|- A short while.
{17008}{17096}- I suppose we all want to do well.|- Yes, sir.
{17238}{17306}A message from my wife.
{17332}{17413}- You married?|- Yes, sir, I am.
{17419}{17485}Nice to be married, huh?
{17896}{17941}Just follow me.
{18949}{19015}- Oh, God...|- Federal officer. Hands in the air.
{19021}{19076}Get 'em up. Drop it.
{19082}{19143}Damn it, I can't, it'll break.
{19170}{19229}Mr Ness. Look, I was just...
{19235}{19284}Geez, I'm sorry.
{19332}{19422}Listen, I can do a lot for you,|what you're tryin' to do.
{19427}{19480}I get the big scoop,|you make a big splash.
{19485}{19592}Get some support. What do you say?|Let's be real, let me help you.
{19598}{19651}Okay. Just shut up.
{20288}{20356}All right now...|Let's do some good!
{20689}{20725}Hold it right there!
{20787}{20898}Federal officer. You're under arrest|for violations of the Volstead Act.
{21112}{21184}Let's cover the doors!|Don't let anybody out!
{21228}{21281}Preseuski.
{21307}{21381}- I'm here with permission.|- Who gave you permission?
{21387}{21457}- Mr Ness!|- Sorry, let him through here.
{21481}{21547}Let him through here.
{21574}{21650}You want to take your picture,|take it now.
{21677}{21734}- You ready?|- Ready.
{22361}{22410}Liquor, huh?
{22469}{22516}Get him out of here.
{22522}{22620}- Tear the place apart!|- I mean now, get him out!
{22730}{22791}That means you, too.
{22908}{22953}Christ!
{24831}{24919}Now, what do you think you're doing?
{24925}{25042}You want to throw garbage? Throw it|in the goddamn trash basket.
{25047}{25124}Don't you have|more important things to do?
{25130}{25181}Yeah.
{25186}{25247}But I'm not doing them right now.
{25274}{25341}Do we understand each other?
{25422}{25488}Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?
{25522}{25614}- Why are you packin' the gun?|- I'm a Treasury Officer.
{25685}{25736}All right.
{25742}{25830}Just remember|what we talked about now.
{25926}{25983}Hey... Wait a minute!
{25989}{26079}What the hell kind of police|do you have in this goddamn city?
{26084}{26153}You just turned your back|on an armed man.
{26158}{26248}- You're a Treasury officer.|- I just told you I was.
{26253}{26328}Who would claim to be that,|who was not?
{26469}{26543}What's your name and unit?
{26632}{26695}It's right here.
{26729}{26810}You got a beef?|What is it?
{26868}{26941}How did you know I had a gun?
{26946}{27036}What do you want,|a free lesson in police work?
{27094}{27126}No.
{27208}{27253}Are you okay, pal?
{27296}{27362}I had a rough day on the job.
{27401}{27475}- Are you going home now?|- I was about to.
{27546}{27642}Well, then, you just fulfilled|the first rule of law enforcement.
{27740}{27834}Make sure when your shift is over|you go home alive.
{27861}{27915}Here endeth the lesson.
{29309}{29425}$100,000 for 40 barrels.|Make sure there are no empties.
{29430}{29504}I'm gonna give you the ledger,|everything is in the book.
{29509}{29580}55 gallons to the barrel.
{29913}{29978}- It's Eddie.|- Come in, Eddie.
{30556}{30692}So, he gets into the snowplough,|and he says, "Let's do some good".
{30697}{30755}And then, we bust through...
{31929}{32016}- Mr Ness?|- Yes?
{32021}{32101}I came here to thank you.
{32106}{32140}It was...
{32145}{32236}...my little girl that got killed|with that bomb.
{32272}{32316}I'm sorry. Please.
{32356}{32416}I'm... I'm so sorry.
{32442}{32560}You see, it's... because I know|that you have children, too.
{32586}{32712}And that this is real for you,|that these men cause us tragedy.
{32717}{32806}And I know that you will|put a stop to them.
{32832}{32875}And you do that, now.
{34242}{34321}- What do you want?|- I'd like to talk to you.
{34375}{34426}Come in.
{34508}{34579}I need a small group of men,|handpicked, starting with you.
{34584}{34679}Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.
{34703}{34833}- Now, how can I help you?|- Just work with me.
{34838}{34924}- But why should I, though?|- Because you're a good cop.
{34959}{35022}- How do you know that?|- You told me.
{35041}{35099}If I'm such a good cop...
{35130}{35202}How come I'm walkin' the beat,|then, at my age?
{35207}{35253}Do you want to tell me?
{35258}{35327}Well, maybe I'm that|Whore with a Heart of Gold.
{35332}{35422}Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?|Is that what you want to hear?
{35427}{35475}I didn't ask you, and I don't care!
{35480}{35570}You want to stay on the beat?|You do that.
{35575}{35679}If you'd like to come with me,|I need your help.
{35726}{35767}I'm askin' you for help.
{35865}{35958}Well... that's the thing you fear,|isn't it?
{36047}{36174}Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you|ten years and... twenty pounds ago.
{36179}{36316}But... I just think it got...|more important to me...
{36321}{36362}...to stay alive.
{36537}{36633}And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.|Thank you, no.
{36977}{37064}That's good, Andy. Let's start up|the thing and take a little ride.
{37069}{37130}I wanna hear|that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!
{37135}{37215}- Yeah, let me open the door here.|- Yeah, go ahead.
{37220}{37302}Whoopsy daisy,|pick up the door there, Andy.
{37307}{37401}Throw it in the back seat.|Now, let me get the thing started.
{37406}{37455}Yeah, start it up, Andy.
{37622}{37696}Holy mackerel, Andy!|Listen to that Bearcat motor!
{37701}{37814}Yeah, it sounds like the bear|is chasin' that cat all round it!
{37855}{37903}Andy! She's boilin' over!
{38168}{38238}- Mr Ness?|- Yes.
{38243}{38301}Oscar Wallace.
{38345}{38419}I've been assigned here|by the Washington Bureau.
{38424}{38478}- Really?|- Yes.
{38483}{38596}Well, I'm glad to have you here,|Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me?
{38622}{38690}We are a little in the dark here,|but any ideas you may have...
{38695}{38742}Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.
{38747}{38840}And the one I want to try first...|is this.
{38926}{39024}He has not filed a return since 1926.
{39061}{39149}- A return...?|- An income tax return.
{39185}{39221}- Income tax.|- Yes, sir.
{39226}{39332}- What do you do at the Bureau?|- Oh, I'm an accountant.
{39358}{39457}- An accountant?|- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...
{39483}{39536}Would you excuse me?
{39616}{39674}Please.
{40287}{40346}Okay. Let's go.
{40351}{40445}- Where are we going?|- These walls have ears.
{40511}{40611}You said you wanted to know|how to get Capone.
{40667}{40772}Do you really want to get him?|You see what I'm saying?
{40777}{40887}- What are you prepared to do?|- Everything within the law.
{40892}{40963}And then what are you|prepared to do?
{40968}{41025}If you open the ball|on these people,
{41030}{41091}you must be prepared|to go all the way.
{41096}{41172}Because they won't give up the fight|until one of you is dead.
{41177}{41227}I want to get Capone.|I don't know how.
{41232}{41349}Here's how you get Capone:|He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.
{41354}{41420}He sends one of yours to hospital,|you send one of his to the morgue!
{41425}{41512}That's the Chicago way!|And that's how you get Capone.
{41567}{41644}Now, do you want to do that?
{41649}{41714}Are you ready to do that?
{41753}{41849}I'm making you a deal.|Do you want this deal?
{41874}{41932}I have sworn to put this man away,
{41937}{42061}with any and all legal means|at my disposal, and I will do so.
{42249}{42329}Well, the Lord hates a coward.
{42501}{42578}Do you know what a blood oath is,|Mr Ness?
{42583}{42654}- Yes.|- Good. 'Cause you just took one.
{42703}{42780}How do you think Capone knew|about your raid the other night?
{42785}{42872}- Somebody on the cops told him.|- Right. Welcome to Chicago.
{42877}{42960}This town stinks|like a whorehouse at low tide.
{42965}{43073}First, who can you trust?|Nobody. The cops, nobody.
{43078}{43192}- 'Cause nobody wants you here.|- Then why are you helping me?
{43197}{43269}Because I swore to uphold the law.
{43274}{43342}And if you believe that,|I'll tell you another.
{43347}{43449}- Now, who can you trust?|- I can trust nobody.
{43454}{43552}- That's the sorry truth.|- Then, where are we gonna get help?
{43557}{43673}If you're afraid of getting a rotten|apple, don't go to the barrel.
{43678}{43734}Get it off the tree.
{43760}{43796}Get it off the tree...
{43851}{43927}Finger out of the trigger guard!|Eject those cartridges!
{43932}{44008}Lay the revolver on the ledge|and stand back!
{44013}{44047}About face!
{44052}{44142}Barry! I want you to meet|Mr Eliot Ness.
{44147}{44238}Treasury Department. How are you?|We need a recruit for extended duty.
{44243}{44354}He is to be seconded to the Treasury|Department. We have the full...
{44359}{44437}Barry? Who is consistently|the best shot of this class?
{44442}{44560}- Williamson and Stone.|- Call them out, one at a time.
{44565}{44623}- Are either of the men married?|- No.
{44628}{44690}- Good.|- Williamson!
{44695}{44803}- You're married.|- I don't want any married men.
{44834}{44916}All right, stand easy, son.|I want to ask you something.
{44921}{45027}- Why do you want to join the force?|- To protect and...
{45032}{45097}To protect and serve...|To protect and...
{45102}{45202}Please don't search for the yearbook|answer. Just tell me what you think.
{45207}{45279}- What I think? I...|- You...
{45284}{45359}...could help... the force.
{45380}{45455}- You can help...|- With the force.
{45460}{45571}Thank you.|There goes the next Chief of Police.
{45729}{45765}At ease!
{45770}{45849}Stone! Out here.
{45885}{45952}This kid's a prodigy.
{46000}{46102}- Why do you want to join the force?|- To protect the property and...
{46107}{46178}Oh, please, don't waste my time|with that bullshit.
{46214}{46280}Where are you from, Stone?
{46310}{46390}- From the Southside.|- Stone?
{46395}{46467}George Stone, that's your name?
{46509}{46607}- What's your real name?|- That is my real name.
{46612}{46668}Nah! What was it|before you changed it?
{46759}{46829}- Giuseppe Petri.|- Geez, I knew it!
{46834}{46904}That's all you need,|one thieving wop on the team!
{46932}{46972}What's that you said?
{46977}{47068}I said that you're a lyin' member|of a no-good race.
{47137}{47213}That's much better than you,|you stinkin' Irish pig.
{47256}{47309}Oh, I like him.
{47385}{47434}Yeah, I like him, too.
{47451}{47518}You just joined|the Treasury Department, son.
{47553}{47602}Yeah, okay.
{47634}{47685}Eliot Ness.
{47690}{47784}With reports from stake-outs|on the North and West side, and...
{47789}{47855}Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.
{48032}{48079}What do you think?
{48084}{48162}I think there's nothing|like vaudeville.
{48167}{48283}- That's what I think.|- Now, are you ready to go to work?
{48288}{48373}- Where are we going?|- On a liquor raid.
{48378}{48421}We need another man.
{48426}{48479}Mr Ness? This is very interesting.
{48484}{48582}I've found a financial disbursement|pattern which shows some irregu...
{48587}{48634}- You carry a badge?|- Yes.
{48639}{48688}Carry a gun.
{49085}{49143}- Jimmy...?|- What?
{49195}{49259}What the hell are you dressed for?|Hallowe'en?
{49264}{49309}Shut up. I'm working.
{49314}{49351}Where? The circus?
{49868}{49934}- Well, here we are.|- What are we doing here?
{49939}{49989}Liquor raid.
{50033}{50065}Here?!
{50070}{50173}Everybody knows where the booze is.|The problem isn't finding it.
{50178}{50297}The problem is who wants|to cross Capone. Let's go.
{50469}{50538}You'd better be damn sure, Malone.
{50671}{50775}If you walk through this door,|you're walking into a world of trouble.
{50780}{50851}There's no turning back.|Do you understand?
{50856}{50891}Yes, I do.
{50914}{50971}Good. Give me that axe.
{51183}{51251}- Federal officers!|- Get your hands in the air!
{51256}{51311}- Nobody moves!|- This is a raid!
{51337}{51388}- Everybody...|- What are you doin' here?
{51393}{51483}All this stuff is impounded!|You're all under arrest!
{51488}{51579}Hey! This isn't right!|Hey! This is no good!
{51584}{51671}- You got a warrant?|- Sure! Here's my warrant.
{51710}{51783}How do you think he feels now?|Better... or worse?
{51994}{52051}- What is that?|- What is that?
{52056}{52132}- Yes, what is it?|- God, I'm with a heathen.
{52137}{52257}That is my callbox key.|And that is Saint Jude.
{52262}{52369}Il Santo Jude.|He's the patron saint of lost causes.
{52374}{52438}And policemen.
{52443}{52552}- Patron saint of policemen?|- Everybody needs a friend.
{52578}{52657}Lost causes, policemen...
{52662}{52748}- Which do you want to be?|- I want to be a cop.
{52753}{52797}- You do?|- Yes.
{52802}{52855}Why?
{52860}{52971}'To protect the property|and the citizenry... '
{53011}{53080}Whoa, it's all right.
{53085}{53145}- What?!|- I got to tell you, congratulations!
{53150}{53241}It's okay if I get a picture|of you and your men?
{53246}{53315}Yeah. But not for publication.|Just for us!
{53320}{53383}Anything you say, Mr Ness.
{53388}{53485}Closer in... Oh, that's great.|Okay, ready? Hold it.
{53670}{53732}Life goes on.
{53806}{53929}A man becomes preeminent,|he's expected to have enthusiasms.
{53934}{53983}Enthusiasms...
{54011}{54076}Enthusiasms...
{54109}{54156}What are mine?
{54180}{54276}What draws my admiration?|What is that which gives me joy?
{54281}{54359}- Dames!|- Boozin'!
{54423}{54478}Baseball!
{54624}{54683}A man...
{54688}{54768}A man stands alone at the plate.
{54817}{54879}This is the time for what?
{54902}{54968}For individual achievement.
{55004}{55057}There he stands alone.
{55083}{55138}But in the field, what?
{55164}{55221}Part of a team.
{55239}{55304}Teamwork...
{55367}{55506}Looks, throws, catches, hustles.|Part of one big team.
{55534}{55660}Bats himself the live-long day,|Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.
{55702}{55799}If his team don't field... what is he?
{55853}{55897}You follow me?
{55902}{55966}No one.
{55971}{56094}Sunny day, the stands are full|of fans. What does he have to say?
{56142}{56229}I'm goin' out there for myself.
{56234}{56390}But... I get nowhere|unless the team wins.
{56395}{56450}- Team!|- Team.
{56612}{56661}Jesus Christ!
{57223}{57286}'Now I lay me down to sleep'
{57291}{57372}'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'
{57377}{57444}'If I should die before I wake'
{57449}{57530}'I pray the Lord my soul to take'
{57535}{57581}- Amen.|- God bless...
{57586}{57681}God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,|God bless Daddy. Amen.
{57686}{57734}Amen.
{57944}{57993}Good night.
{57998}{58047}- Good night, Daddy.|- Good night, little girl.
{58052}{58144}Want to rub Eskimo?|Butterfly?
{58383}{58450}- Where are you going?|- What?
{58509}{58545}Where are you going?
{58550}{58618}I thought I'd go downstairs,|some work to do for tomorrow.
{58623}{58725}- You had a full day today, though?|- Yes, I certainly did.
{58730}{58781}And you've still got|some energy left?
{58786}{58827}Oh, a lot of work.
{58832}{58967}Well, why don't you come up|and brush my hair? You 'Detective'.
{59298}{59389}- How are we doin'?|- Capone's organisation is diverse.
{59394}{59500}It owns Canadian Holding Company|Associations, which owns in turn
{59505}{59599}Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,|Jolly Time Playthings...
{59604}{59667}- Jolly Time Playthings?|- Yes.
{59672}{59734}Remind me to get a present|for my daughter.
{59739}{59826}...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,|Miss Lucy Togs... the list is endless!
{59831}{59920}And all the business is legitimate,|and none is owned by Al Capone.
{59925}{59997}But we can get him on|income tax evasion if we can show
{60002}{60101}that any of the 'organisation'|business money is going to him.
{60106}{60207}- Legally, he receives no income.|- He doesn't receive anything?
{60212}{60297}- Mr Ness? You have a visitor.|- Mister Ness!
{60302}{60376}Could we talk for a minute?|I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...
{60381}{60426}Yes, I know who you are.
{60496}{60561}Would you excuse us?
{60609}{60703}We are busy with several large|operations. What can I do for you?
{60708}{60785}I came up to congratulate you|on a job well done.
{60825}{60928}Share your good fortune|on such a lovely day.
{61019}{61058}What's that?
{61177}{61249}- What is that?|- Mr Ness, you're an educated man.
{61254}{61337}Let me pay you the compliment|of being blunt.
{61342}{61481}There is a large and popular business|which you are causing dismay.
{61507}{61621}Why don't you just cross the street|and let things take their course?
{61626}{61698}Would you come in here, please?
{61802}{61918}In Roman times, when a fellow tried|to bribe a public official,
{61923}{61976}they would cut off his nose,|sew him in a bag
{61981}{62068}with a wild animal,|and throw that bag in the river.
{62073}{62178}You tell your master|that we must agree to... disagree!
{62213}{62290}- You're making a mistake.|- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.
{62295}{62405}You fellows are 'untouchable',|is that it? No one can get to you?
{62410}{62491}You tell Capone...|that I'll see him in hell.
{62568}{62616}Hey! Nice house!
{62621}{62689}I said, nice house!|Do you live there?
{62729}{62816}Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?
{62821}{62868}Yes.
{62873}{62927}Nice to have a family.
{62992}{63057}Yes, it is.
{63062}{63170}A man should take care,|see that nothin' happens to them.
{63529}{63576}Catherine?!
{63612}{63657}Catherine!
{63662}{63721}- Where's the baby?|- She's upstairs. Eliot!
{64029}{64118}- What were you doing up?|- I had to finish my ironing.
{64123}{64244}You did? You're gonna come|with Daddy now, okay?
{64526}{64584}Eliot? Okay, it's all right!
{64589}{64644}Okay, let's go.
{64649}{64740}Stay there!|Keep your eye on the street!
{64782}{64867}- Where's Malone?|- On the stake-out. He'll be here.
{64872}{64953}- Who's this guy?|- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.
{64988}{65097}Drive to the station. She'll let you|know where to go when you get there.
{65102}{65156}Take off your hat.
{65161}{65241}Anything happens, shoot first.|You understand me?
{65246}{65299}Yes, Mr Ness.
{65378}{65418}Kiss.
{65423}{65498}- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.|- Okay.
{65583}{65632}Now, go!
{66161}{66201}Malone!
{66227}{66262}- Are they okay?|- Yeah.
{66267}{66348}- You sure the cop's okay?|- He'd better be, he's my cousin.
{66353}{66430}I want to hurt the man, Malone!|You hear me?!
{66435}{66506}I want to take the battle to him.|I want to hurt Capone.
{66511}{66595}Well, then, a Merry Christmas,|we've got some great news.
{66600}{66659}A huge international|shipment's coming.
{66664}{66774}We've got the time, the place|and the whole shebang.
{66779}{66853}Well, what are we doin'|standin' here, then?
{66879}{66927}How do you come by this information?
{66932}{66983}That's the second rule|of police work:
{66988}{67054}If you want to keep a secret,|don't tell the boss.
{67191}{67259}You know he's making|over $3 million a year?
{67264}{67326}But he's paid no taxes,|nothing's in his name.
{67331}{67385}If we can establish|any payments to him,
{67390}{67463}we can prosecute him|for income tax evasion.
{67468}{67500}What?
{67505}{67609}I said, we can prosecute him|for income tax evasion!
{67614}{67694}Try a murderer|for not paying his taxes?!
{67699}{67772}Well, it's better than nothing.
{67777}{67873}All right. How do we|link him to the money?
{67899}{67948}I don't know.
{67987}{68047}Go to sleep, Oscar.
{69167}{69244}A convoy of 5-10 trucks|with good Canadian whiskey
{69249}{69337}will be met by a high-level member|of the Capone organisation.
{69342}{69428}He will be bringing full payment|for the shipment in cash.
{69433}{69574}Now, the meet is to take place just|over the border on the American side.
{69579}{69656}We want to confiscate|the liquor and the cash.
{69661}{69755}- Captain?|- We will await their signal.
{69760}{69835}When they're on the road|and have given the signal,
{69840}{69931}we will engage from|the Canadian side of the bridge.
{69936}{69984}Thus taking them|by surprise from the rear.
{69989}{70101}And surprise, as you very well know,|Mr Ness, is half the battle.
{70106}{70183}Surprise is half the battle.|Many things are half the battle.
{70188}{70292}Losing is half the battle.|Let's think about what is all the battle.
{70297}{70357}Let's take the fight|to them, gentlemen!
{70362}{70415}Thank you, Captain.
{70458}{70532}All right! Move out!
{70949}{71015}Take it easy.
{71033}{71125}Take it easy!|It'll all happen in time.
{71157}{71214}This is the job.
{71219}{71307}Don't wait for it to happen,|don't even want it to happen.
{71312}{71375}Just watch what does happen.
{71404}{71453}Are you my 'tutor'?
{71482}{71550}Yes, sir, that I am.
{71618}{71686}- Did you check it already?|- Yes, I did.
{71691}{71741}Then leave it alone.
{71757}{71819}You're a good cop, Giuseppe.
{71824}{71911}You're doing good.|You're gonna do just fine.
{71969}{72067}- Wallace, are you cold?|- Yes, I am, a little.
{72072}{72146}Then stamp your feet.|It'll keep you warm.
{72151}{72225}You learn something,|20 years walking the beat.
{72230}{72334}Stitches and standing in the rain...
{73034}{73087}Listen, Mr Ness...
{73132}{73171}I had an idea.
{74501}{74575}You all have your spare shells?
{74921}{75031}If you have to fire,|hold low and squeeze.
{75036}{75106}And put your man down.
{75166}{75230}Because he'll do the same to you.
{75235}{75289}Shoot to kill.
{75294}{75398}- Did you hear what I said?|- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.
{75436}{75495}Let's go.
{76058}{76091}Easy...
{76096}{76183}The Canadians will not show|until I flash the badge.
{76189}{76274}So we must cover the ground|to the bridge as quickly as possible.
{76279}{76320}George, the count's right.
{76325}{76404}I'm concerned about|the size of these barrels!
{76409}{76473}Malone, you and I will|take the men...
{76478}{76548}Move it! Move it, Georgie!
{76553}{76637}Get over here!|Leave the stuff in the cars!
{76660}{76692}Charge!
{76745}{76791}What the hell!|You got to die of somethin'.
{76870}{76965}- Look! Here they come!|- Mounties! Let's get out of here!
{76971}{77017}Move, move!
{77245}{77301}Let's go!
{77406}{77437}I can't believe it!
{77442}{77515}- Here are the codes.|- Give me that.
{77520}{77563}Don't let those cars off the bridge!
{78015}{78060}Stone, take the first car!
{78101}{78160}Get this shit out of the way!
{78632}{78664}Tough guy!
{78745}{78783}Stone!
{78789}{78821}Go!
{78864}{78909}Stone!
{78936}{78967}I'm okay.
{79005}{79053}You thugs!
{79394}{79447}You all right?
{79453}{79521}Yeah. There he is! Go get him!
{79825}{79922}All right!|Enough of this running shit!
{79928}{80016}Well, Georgie-boy!|Well, what have we got here?
{80044}{80093}Hello.
{82063}{82098}All right! Drop the gun!
{82103}{82162}Put your hands in the air,|you're under arrest.
{82189}{82237}I said, drop it!
{82283}{82320}Stop!
{82440}{82518}God, didn't ya hear what I said?!
{82523}{82574}What are you, deaf?!
{82605}{82653}What is this, a game?!
{83270}{83325}Here. Sit down.
{83536}{83600}Stone's gonna be all right.
{83606}{83676}I got the fellow with the satchel.
{83836}{83892}- I had to kill him.|- Oh, yeah.
{83898}{83966}He's as dead as Julius Caesar.
{83998}{84085}- Would you rather it was you?|- No, I would not.
{84091}{84200}Well, then you've done your duty.|Go home and sleep well tonight.
{84206}{84284}The things you see|when you're out without your gun.
{84289}{84376}Now you're a long way|from the Southside, George.
{84382}{84469}I'm talkin' to you. Did you come|here to open a shooting gallery?
{84475}{84555}I want you to write down the names|of your superiors and contacts.
{84561}{84633}Why don't you kiss my ass?
{84638}{84690}- Perhaps you didn't hear me.|- Eliot?
{84696}{84745}- You've broken the law...|- Eliot!
{84751}{84799}You can be tough in Leavenworth|for 30 years.
{84805}{84877}- You're going inside for all day!|- Is that what you want?
{84883}{84949}- Eliot!|- What?!
{84954}{85010}Look at this!
{85016}{85084}- Look at this!|- What is this?
{85137}{85180}What is this?
{85199}{85289}You got a lot of money changing|hands in this book.
{85295}{85396}What is this, 'war'?|And 'police precincts'?
{85437}{85517}And you got a heading here...|'Circuit Court'.
{85522}{85609}You got a heading here,|'Circuit Court'. What is this?
{85615}{85685}Nothin'. There's nothin'|you can make out of it.
{85691}{85771}If any of these coded entries|indicate payment to Capone,
{85776}{85819}then we can put Capone away.
{85824}{85912}- Which entry is Al Capone?|- A. Costa, is that his code name?
{85918}{85984}You'll do the whole thing|in the joint unless you help us.
{85989}{86047}Translate this ledger for us!
{86053}{86090}- In hell.|- In hell?!
{86123}{86208}You will hang high|unless you cooperate.
{86214}{86300}This man can finger Al Capone,|put him behind bars.
{86306}{86347}Why don't you guys just fuck off?!
{86404}{86507}I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have|that information one way or another.
{86512}{86558}- Not that way. Out.|- You're gonna talk!
{86564}{86630}You're gonna be beggin' to talk!
{86636}{86710}- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!|- Enough out of you.
{86801}{86856}Hey, come on, you, on your feet!
{86861}{86941}I need you to help me|to translate this book!
{86946}{86994}I'm not gonna ask you a second time.
{86999}{87051}I'm gonna count to three.
{87097}{87182}What's the matter? Can't you talk|with a gun in your mouth?
{87232}{87264}One.
{87366}{87411}Two!
{87458}{87494}Three.
{87520}{87555}I'm gonna talk!
{87560}{87670}Don't! I'm gonna tell ya whatever|ya want. What do ya want to know?
{87745}{87835}Now, don't let him clean himself|until after he talks.
{87840}{87913}Now, ask him what you want to know.
{87919}{88018}All right... Okay, I want to know|the name of the bookkeeper.
{88024}{88123}I want a complete translation|of the code. I want a complete...
{88128}{88187}Mister Ness!
{88334}{88389}I do not approve of your methods!
{88417}{88530}Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.
{88630}{88685}- What?|- They got the shipment.
{88690}{88751}- What?!|- They got the whole shipment.
{88756}{88851}- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!|- We're trying to locate...
{88856}{88998}What am I, alone in this world? Did I|ask you what you're tryin' to do?
{89003}{89113}I want you to get this fuck where he|breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!
{89118}{89195}I want his family dead,|his house burnt to the ground!
{89200}{89255}I want to piss on his ashes!
{89260}{89386}Look at this guy, this guy,|he's so serious.
{89391}{89469}- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.|- He does?
{89474}{89521}- Yes.|- Like what?
{89558}{89598}Like what his name is.
{89603}{89703}John, I thought that was all settled.|I thought we liked John.
{89708}{89768}I suppose his middle name|will be Law.
{89786}{89866}No... it'll be Edgar.
{89902}{89988}- It'll be J. Edgar...|- I don't think so.
{90074}{90131}God, you're beautiful.
{90175}{90229}You should have seen us last night.
{90279}{90354}I know. I should have been here.|I wanted to be here.
{90360}{90438}I know. I understand, I do.
{90475}{90544}Just tell me, are you being careful?
{90549}{90633}- Careful as mice.|- Are you making progress?
{90638}{90689}- Progress?|- Yes?
{90695}{90795}Mrs Ness, I think your husband|just became the man who got Al Capone.
{91002}{91110}Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued|for Alphonse Capone
{91115}{91233}by my office this morning,|for the crime of evading
{91238}{91323}and conspiring to evade|Federal Income Tax.
{91328}{91403}- What's the maximum he could get?|- If convicted on all counts,
{91408}{91506}Mr Capone could have|up to 28 years.
{91511}{91587}Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.
{91744}{91847}The car's in the yard. When ya get|him there, don't answer the phone.
{91852}{91903}- We'll call, let it ring...|- Twice.
{91908}{91954}- We'll call...|- From the corner.
{91959}{92045}- Anybody knocks on the door...|- Come out shooting. I got it.
{92050}{92122}You enjoy the tactical aspects|of law enforcement, Oscar?
{92127}{92194}Much more diverting|than accounting.
{92199}{92251}I'm bein' good to you,|you got to be good to me.
{92256}{92339}We made a deal,|we're gonna stick to it, okay?
{92470}{92541}Oh, yes, much more diverting|than accounting.
{92547}{92600}Okay, we see yous tonight.
{92606}{92695}All right, all the way down|and no stops.
{92889}{92977}...he's been saying,|"I will speak up."
{93021}{93120}For which I must commend|the excellent work
{93125}{93213}of Eliot Ness|and his squad of Untouchables.
{93275}{93332}- What was it, a boy or a girl?|- Boy.
{93337}{93408}- Congratulations! What's his name?|- John.
{93413}{93484}- John?|- Yeah. John James.
{93513}{93570}- So she's okay?|- Yeah, she's okay.
{93575}{93658}In fact, when she gets out,|she wants to repaint the house.
{93663}{93767}Then she'll find the house too small,|you'll have to move.
{93772}{93899}- Goodness, it's nice to be married.|- If you can stand the pain.
{93904}{93942}Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace?
{93947}{94079}Didn't you see him? He just went|down in the service elevator.
{94103}{94200}- You keep an eye out at all times...|- Take it easy, we'll be fine.
{94205}{94264}They are going to...
{94459}{94537}- Did he say the service elevator?|- Yes.
{94684}{94765}- Wallace! Wallace!|- Here, let's take the stairs.
{95725}{95781}Oh, no.
{95807}{95881}- No, no!|- Easy... Easy!
{95942}{95978}Oscar.
{96913}{96967}Oh, Jesus.
{97057}{97123}You gonna be all right?
{97606}{97730}It's always a crime when a young guy|goes down in the line, Jimmy.
{97756}{97831}I'd hate to see it happen|to someone I know.
{97836}{97923}Sometimes it's better|not to get involved.
{97928}{97979}Jimmy!
{97984}{98072}Take a day off.|Get out of the city for a while.
{98077}{98126}You know what I mean?
{98536}{98582}- Al Capone.|- We have no Mr Capone...
{98587}{98671}- I know, get him.|- We have no Mr Capone...
{98682}{98721}I said...
{98880}{98959}- Something you want here?|- My friend was killed today.
{98964}{99030}- I don't care.|- You don't care.
{99100}{99155}Now he does.
{99160}{99264}Come on here, Capone. You want|to fight? You and me, right here?
{99269}{99301}That's it, come on!
{99306}{99392}You afraid to come out from behind|your men, to stand up for yourself?
{99398}{99493}- You want to do the mat now?|- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!
{99499}{99543}- What?|- Easy.
{99549}{99633}You talk to me like that in front|of my son? Fuck you and your family!
{99700}{99776}Easy. It's me. It's me!
{99782}{99823}Not this way.
{99828}{99892}You fuck, you got nothin'!|You're nothin' but talk and a badge.
{99897}{100034}You're here because you got nothin'|in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'!
{100039}{100144}If you were a man, you would've done|it now! You got nothin', you punk!
{100370}{100443}Well, no, I understand.
{100448}{100517}Believe me, I understand.
{100695}{100752}Well, what's happened?
{100787}{100898}He says he can't be unprotected.
{100940}{101004}What is it that the guy says?
{101009}{101072}He says he won't make|a fool out of himself,
{101077}{101157}and he won't go into court|without a witness.
{101162}{101264}So tomorrow morning the D.A. Will|announce that he's dropping the case.
{101269}{101362}- He's gonna give up.|- He won't do it without a witness.
{101367}{101431}We have Wallace's files|and the ledgers.
{101436}{101524}There's a time when I think|you have to cut your losses.
{101550}{101599}Hello?
{101648}{101697}Hello.
{101736}{101784}Yes.
{101864}{101934}No, he didn't have a family.
{101993}{102058}How is everything there?
{102136}{102220}No, you do it however you want.
{102269}{102323}I promise I will.
{102349}{102405}You give her my love.
{102410}{102459}I love you, too.
{102510}{102634}Mr Ness, we got a ledger here listing|payments to Chicago City officials.
{102639}{102734}- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...|- I think that's enough for today.
{102739}{102836}- If we don't stay on top...|- That'll do. Thank you.
{102841}{102935}I'd like to request to stick around.
{102963}{103025}- We got to bust these guys.|- I know we got to.
{103238}{103288}Is that it?
{103314}{103377}- I'm sorry?|- You heard me.
{103382}{103441}My question is, are we done?
{103489}{103546}Yes, I think we're done.
{103551}{103620}So we sat in at a game|that was above our head?
{103625}{103682}It appears so.|It appears so to Mr Wallace.
{103687}{103742}He's dead! And the D.A.|Is gonna drop the case!
{103747}{103802}He will not go into court|without a witness
{103807}{103878}and without Capone's bookkeeper,|Walter Payne.
{103883}{103999}- What are you prepared to do now?|- What would you have me do?
{104005}{104071}I have taken this|as far as it can go.
{104407}{104505}- What did your wife want?|- She wanted to know if I was...
{104531}{104598}- My wife?|- Yeah.
{104693}{104762}She wanted to know|if I was all right.
{104818}{104874}It's nice being married, eh?
{104904}{104936}Yes.
{104941}{105020}She's sitting in some room surrounded|by people she doesn't know,
{105025}{105128}going over...|kitchen colour charts or something.
{105287}{105424}Some part of the world still cares|what colour the kitchen is.
{105533}{105636}Eliot, I want you to do|one more thing for me.
{105694}{105779}Get back to the D.A. And stall him.
{105796}{105896}- Wait a minute, stall him with what?|- Just do as I say.
{105978}{106036}I think I know how to find this guy.
{106086}{106152}Walter?
{106157}{106277}Al says we got to get out of town|until he can fix this subpoena thing.
{106282}{106353}We're leavin' tonight.
{106421}{106481}Two ball, down.
{106587}{106651}Mike, you got a minute?
{106656}{106720}I do now, don't I?
{106747}{106826}And what are you doin'|in a club for cops, Jimmy?
{106849}{106910}This is a place for cops.
{106916}{106977}Can we step outside?
{106983}{107087}All right, all right,|but I got nothin' to say to ya.
{107190}{107321}Where the hell are we going, for a|swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.
{107377}{107443}What? What?!
{107448}{107522}I just need one more|piece of information.
{107527}{107574}One more? Jimmy!
{107579}{107700}- I just risked my life for ya.|- I need to find that bookkeeper.
{107727}{107870}Are you crazy? You're crazy.|I warned you to get out of town.
{107875}{107971}- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.|- I need to find that bookkeeper.
{107976}{108086}You're fuckin' nuts, man!|You're out of your fuckin' mind!
{108091}{108145}And I tried to save your life.
{108166}{108276}Get your hands off. You owe me,|Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'.
{108281}{108357}- My people are being killed.|- We're your people!
{108362}{108482}You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!|They've ruined this town.
{108487}{108588}For ten years I can't say that I'm|a cop for the shit that's goin' on!
{108594}{108726}Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!|Look at yourself! Look at yourself!
{108772}{108906}Go on and live the charade, with your|soft clothes and federal stooges.
{108911}{109007}- What do you think he's gonna do?|- Keep your mouth off that!
{109012}{109111}I need to know where this guy is,|and I need to know now!
{109116}{109213}I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit|that I know that you've done!
{109218}{109279}I'm gonna turn you over!
{109284}{109369}- This is a dead man talkin' to me.|- Is it?
{109421}{109465}You're dead.
{110006}{110047}Who the hell do ya think ya are?
{110052}{110120}I'll have your ass hangin'|from the flagpole in the mornin'.
{110325}{110399}Let's cut the woofing, pal.|You tell me,
{110404}{110477}or you're going to hospital|or the fuckin' morgue!
{110482}{110542}You're gonna fight it out|and we'll have a case.
{110547}{110633}Yes? On what basis?|I'm not gonna make a fool...
{110638}{110701}Don't tell me about|makin' a fool out of yourself.
{110706}{110768}I have men out there|risking more than that.
{110773}{110833}We have a lead,|and we are following that lead
{110839}{110957}at risk to more than our standing.|So don't you dare stop now.
{111007}{111056}- Yeah, Stone.|- Give me Ness.
{111062}{111099}He's at the D.A. 's.
{111105}{111175}Tell him I know where Payne is|and to meet me at my place.
{111642}{111679}- Al! Al!|- Mr Capone!
{111684}{111790}- What about that court case?|- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'.
{111795}{111894}Somebody messes with me,|I'm gonna mess with him.
{111920}{111996}Somebody steals from me,|I'm gonna say 'you stole',
{112001}{112079}not talk to him|for spittin' on the sidewalk.
{112084}{112118}You understand?
{112138}{112246}Now, I have done nothing|to hurt these people.
{112251}{112317}But they're angered at me.|So what do they do?
{112322}{112477}Doctor up some income tax, for which|they got no case, to annoy me.
{112482}{112545}To speak to me like men? No.
{112550}{112620}To harass a peaceful man.
{112654}{112703}I pray to God that|if I ever have a grievance,
{112708}{112789}I would have|just a little more self respect.
{112869}{112946}I'll tell you one more thing.|In an all-out prize fight,
{112951}{113022}when one guy's left standing,|that's how you know who won.
{117043}{117097}Isn't that just like a wop?
{117135}{117191}Brings a knife to a gun fight.
{117294}{117355}Get out of here, ya dago bastard!
{117388}{117439}Go on, get your ass out of here!
{119891}{119933}Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

{137320}{137368}Take him.
{137407}{137467}Two.
{138094}{138158}The two coded entries|in this ledger
{138163}{138275}represent cash disbursement|to all levels of city officials,
{138280}{138416}members of the police|and to Alphonse Capone.
{138464}{138532}- That's correct.|- Excuse me?
{138570}{138624}I said that is correct.
{138630}{138745}And you will decipher|these coded entries for us?
{138798}{138849}I will.
{138854}{138910}Sorry, Mr Payne, I can't hear you.
{138915}{138982}I said, I will.
{138987}{139100}You were in charge|of disbursements for Mr Capone?
{139105}{139137}Yes, I was.
{139142}{139215}And you personally|distributed monies...
{139220}{139317}...vast, undeclared monies...
{139322}{139402}...to Mr Capone?
{139407}{139464}Yes, I did.
{139469}{139537}Would you tell us the amounts?
{139571}{139718}In a three-year period I personally|disbursed monies to Mr Capone
{139724}{139841}in excess of one|and a third million dollars.
{139908}{139977}Would you repeat that amount, please?
{140003}{140141}- One and a third million dollars.|- Thank you very much.
{140511}{140588}I don't understand it.|What does Capone have?
{140594}{140693}We're nailing the lid on his coffin,|and he's smiling.
{141247}{141326}The son-of-a-bitch|is wearing a gun in court.
{141396}{141461}Get me the bailiff.
{141500}{141533}It'll be a fast trial.
{141624}{141730}The man in the front row wearing|a white suit is carrying a gun.
{141735}{141853}I don't want this to turn|into something. I'll lead you out.
{142018}{142091}Could we speak to you|a minute, please?
{142766}{142886}- Get up against it.|- You heard him. Now, up against it!
{142911}{143001}- What's this?|- Empty all your pockets, all of it.
{143007}{143093}- I've got a permit for that.|- Fine, let's see it.
{143173}{143284}- I'm not the one under indictment.|- Everything on the table.
{143347}{143400}- Let me see.|- Give him his gun back.
{143405}{143459}"To Whom It May Concern.|Please extend to the bearer,"
{143464}{143556}"Mr Frank Nitti, all possible|courtesy and consideration."
{143562}{143620}"William Thompson,|Mayor of the City of Chicago."
{143625}{143708}I'm sorry, Mr Ness,|you'll have to give it back.
{143713}{143808}Fine. But that man does not go|back into that courtroom.
{143813}{143889}- Do you understand me?|- Yes, sir.
{144612}{144739}1634 Racine... You know, I used|to have a friend who lived there.
{145078}{145141}Don't. Let him go.
{145229}{145305}- No!|- Here, take it.
{151309}{151437}Here I am, Treasury Man.|Come on! Harass me!
{151473}{151527}What are you waitin' for?
{151553}{151625}Don't just stand there!|Harass me!
{151721}{151780}Don't push me.
{151844}{151909}- They're gonna burn you, buddy.|- Yeah?
{151914}{151989}Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,|you son-of-a-bitch!
{151994}{152046}'Cause you killed my friend!
{152051}{152138}- He died like a pig.|- What did you say?
{152144}{152230}I said that your friend died|screaming like a stuck Irish pig.
{152236}{152319}Now you think about that|when I beat the rap.
{152643}{152708}Did he sound anything like that?
{153437}{153507}One picture, come on, one picture.
{153569}{153633}Mr Ness, take a look at this.
{153671}{153714}Mr Ness?
{153753}{153860}Mr Ness, are you doin' okay?|I think you'd better see this.
{153886}{153955}- What is it?|- That's the jury list, Mr Ness.
{153960}{154003}They've been bribed.
{154008}{154106}I got it out of Nitti's coat.|Where is Nitti?
{154143}{154194}He's in the car.
{154645}{154744}This constitutes no evidence.|I'm not about to allow...
{154749}{154885}Your Honour, the truth is that Capone|is a killer and he will go free.
{154891}{155008}There is only one way to deal with|such men, and that is hunt them down.
{155013}{155111}I have. I have forsworn myself.|I have broken laws I swore to defend.
{155116}{155227}I am content that I have done right.|That man must be stopped, you must...
{155232}{155314}I'll be the judge|of what I must do, Mr Ness.
{155554}{155616}Would you excuse us?
{157109}{157152}- Bailiff.|- Yes, sir.
{157264}{157331}I want you to go next door|to Judge Hoffman's Court,
{157336}{157411}where they've just begun hearing|a divorce action.
{157416}{157542}I want you to bring that jury in here|and take this jury to his court.
{157585}{157673}- Are those instructions clear?|- Yes, sir, they're clear.
{157699}{157736}What's he talking about?
{157781}{157888}Bailiff, I want you|to switch the juries.
{157893}{157949}Your Honour, I object!
{157954}{158001}Overruled.
{158097}{158140}What did you tell him?
{158183}{158261}I told him his name was|in the ledger, too.
{158293}{158360}His name wasn't in the ledger!
{158365}{158438}Wait a second! Is this the law?|What's goin' on here?
{158444}{158479}- You're out of order.|- What's goin' on?
{158484}{158564}- I think...|- Do somethin' here.
{158569}{158631}What do I look like to you?|Do somethin'!
{158645}{158693}Order!
{158719}{158821}Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw|our plea of Not Guilty,
{158826}{158873}and enter a plea of Guilty.
{158959}{159026}- Guilty?|- Order in the court!
{159032}{159080}Order!
{159288}{159364}Bailiff! Bailiff!
{159369}{159428}Bailiff, clear the courtroom!
{159464}{159496}Eliot!
{159501}{159577}Your Honour!|Is that justice?
{159582}{159646}Please, why did he switch the jury?
{159651}{159713}Are you gonna go|after the organisation?
{159718}{159753}Excuse me.
{159784}{159863}I'm askin' Your Honour,|is this justice?
{159979}{160033}Is this justice?
{160102}{160167}Never stop fighting|till the fight is done.
{160172}{160208}What did you say?
{160213}{160288}I said, never stop fighting|till the fight is done.
{160293}{160342}- What?|- You heard me, Capone. It's over.
{160347}{160408}You're nothin'|but a lot of talk and a badge.
{160413}{160480}Here endeth the lesson.
{160485}{160587}You're nothin'|but a lot of talk and a badge!
{160592}{160669}You're nothin'|but a lot of talk and a badge!
{162543}{162595}So much violence.
{164183}{164241}Cleaning up a little.
{164449}{164521}I guess this is goodbye.
{164553}{164591}Goodbye, George.
{164654}{164728}I want to... thank you for this.
{164754}{164797}No. Thank you.
{165178}{165289}Mr Ness... I think he would have|wanted you to have that.
{165294}{165368}He'd have wanted a cop to have it.
{165455}{165517}I'm going home.
{165779}{165842}Mr Ness!|Any comment for the record?
{165847}{165912}'The man who put|Al Capone on the spot.'
{165916}{165978}I just happened to be there|when the wheel went round.
{165984}{166056}They say they're going|to repeal prohibition.
{166061}{166135}- What will you do then?|- I think I'll have a drink.
