1
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.270
You look stunning.

2
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.400
I still can't believe
how fast his day's come.

3
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.240
"Love is patient.

4
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.410
Love is kind.

5
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.330
It does not envy and
it does not boast.

6
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.500
It's not proud.

7
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510
It does not dishonor others.

8
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.770
It's not self-seeking.

9
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.870
It is not easily angered,

10
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.770
and it keeps no
record of wrongs.

11
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.430
Love does not delight in evil,

12
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.560
but rejoices with the truth.

13
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.100
It always protects,
always trusts,

14
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.130
always hopes and
always perseveres.

15
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.790
Love never fails."

16
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.200
But I failed us, Tess.

17
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.380
How long have you
been writing about us?

18
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.690
After we kissed.

19
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.970
Are you fucking kidding me?

20
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.260
Where are you going?

21
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.520
I'm done.

22
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.020
We're just a bomb
waiting to explode.

23
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.480
This was a wake up call.

24
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.180
You would never let me read
what you were writing in there,

25
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.790
and now the whole world gets to!

26
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.960
I never meant for
it to be published.

27
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.570
Fuck, this never should
have happened like this.

28
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.970
You accidentally wrote a book,

29
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.750
and then you shopped it around

30
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.490
to publishers without asking me.

31
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.190
What is the point in
everything we've been through

32
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.671
if we can't channel that into
something that helps people?

33
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.020
It's never too late.

34
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.330
People can always change.

35
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.200
That is the kind of
story "After" is.

36
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.710
"After?"

37
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.280
It's my journey after I met you.

38
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.160
I think that journey's over.

39
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.650
My failure was thinking

40
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.250
that I was writing
my journey, my story,

41
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.910
but it was our story, Tess.

42
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.060
But I know our story
isn't finished.

43
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.770
Even if you've moved
on,

44
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.720
I can't.

45
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.250
I can't imagine my
world without you

46
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.290
because without you
there is only me,

47
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.310
broken,

48
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.300
lost,

49
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.170

50

51
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.180

Lee didn't publish

Yeah, it is.

78

window of relevance

79
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.820

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.980
They're talking about me opening

186
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.290
a London branch of
Vance Publishing.

187
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.060
The ever expanding empire.

188
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.970
I've heard a rumor
that you're nearly

189
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.560
a year behind on delivering
your new manuscript.

190
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.400
Well, don't believe
everything you hear.

191
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.770
Are you lying to me?

192
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.390
No, I'm not lying.

193
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.430
I was just giving you
some general life advice.

194
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.480
But yeah, to be
fair, in this case,

195
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.990
what you hear does
happen to be true.

196
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.440
Hardin, what the fuck
is going on with you?

197
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.440
We're just trying to help you.

198
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.090
We can't do that if we
don't know what's going on.

199
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.580
I don't really know
what's going on either.

200
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.580
I keep on trying to write
and every time I do,

201
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.580
everything just ends
up going back to Tessa.

202
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.760
I keep rewriting the
old stuff, you know?

203
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.810
The same things, what
ifs and hypotheticals

204
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.360
don't really matter
in the end, do they?

205
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.480
Because anyway I look at it,

206
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.330
she's not here and
nothing matters

207
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.070
in this world if
she's not in it.

208
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.520
I don't have another book in me.

209
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.340
I never did.

210
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.620
I think it was all a fluke.

211
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.340
And it's okay if you don't.

212
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.300
You have a gift.

213
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.820
All writers go through this.

214
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.810
Do they?

215
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.060
How the hell would, you know?

216
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.040
You haven't written a
damn thing in your life.

217
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.790
But I have spent my entire
career finding diamonds

218
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.140
in the slush pile, and I
know talent when I see it.

219
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.110
Look, let me get in
touch with Dowlish

220
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.670
and see if I can do a deal.

221
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.200
- No.
- Ease your deadline.

222
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.480
You can come over to us and
take as long as you need.

223
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.810
We've been over this.

224
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.690
- I don't want to.
- Hardin, if you cannot-

225
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.380
Go on, just go.

226
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.860
- You can't- - Just go.

227
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.420
You need to.

228
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.900
I do have to go actually,
because you were late.

229
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.170
No, no, I've
got this, I've got this.

230
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.540
Waiter, I'll have another.

231
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.610
I'm around, all right?

232
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.260
If you need me, give me a call.

233
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.450
You know, a change of scenery
might do you some good,

234
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.920
might be inspiring to just
get out of here for a while.

235
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.760
A bit a distance might
give you new perspective,

236
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.550
might help you make peace with
your past so you can move on.

237
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.600
I'm not ready to move on yet.

238
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.120
No, I know, I didn't
mean in regard to...

239
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.600
I meant move forward.

240
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.900
Yeah, just let go of
some of your regrets

241
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.560
so you can stop dragging
them into your future.

242
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.570
I met Nathalie over Christmas.

243
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.400
She asked after you.

244
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.760
How is she?

245
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.110
Well, we only spoke for
a couple of minutes,

246
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.360
but she seemed good.

247
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.460
She moved to Lisbon.

248
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.580
- Lisbon?
- Mm.

249
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.160
Portugal.

250
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.480
I know where Lisbon is, Mom.

251
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.900
I just meant...

252
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.940

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.700
Just give me one moment
and I'll be right with you.

361
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.960
- Sorry.
- Take your time.

362
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.360
Excuse me, would you?

363
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.710
Okay.

364
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.970
What are you doing here?

365
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.370
Making amends.

366
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.980
I was hoping to.

367
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.430
I'm in the middle
of an appointment.

368
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.650
You need to leave.

369
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.280
I don't
need long, honestly.

370
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.550
- I just wanted to-
- Please.

371
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.170
I came all this way to find you.

372
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.440
Please!

373
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.980
Hi.

374
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.760
How you feelin', Hardin?

375
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.820
- Pocket kings.
- Fuck!

376
00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.170
I'll be takin' that watch.

377
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.719
Hey, man, don't
do him like that.

378
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.800
His old man gave it to him.

379
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.040
What? Bet's a bet.

380
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.080
Yep.

381
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.870
It's all right,
you'll win it back.

382
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.460
I'm not stupid enough
to wager something

383
00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.530
I'm not willing to lose.

384
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.290
Well, he didn't have
much else to bet.

385
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.270
Well, then he
shouldn't have played.

386
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.530
Well, I dunno what else to say.

387
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.480
I'm looking for Mark.

388
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.060
It's Mark Junior,

389
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.190
although little guy
doesn't like that much.

390
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.999
Anyway, if you're
looking for my old man,

391
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.110
he's gone home for the day.

392
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.749
I spoke to him on
the phone earlier

393
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.590
about my car and he said
that he would take a look.

394
00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.500
Okay, what do you
reckon's the problem?

395
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.850
The radiator.

396
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.600
I really wouldn't know.

397
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.250
It's making a awful
sound.

398
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.220
- Oh, yeah, yeah-
- That junker looks

399
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.310
older than you.

400
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.500
It's hardly worth fixin'.

401
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.860
Back seats look
all right, though.

402
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.940
Oh, shut up, dude.

403
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.530
- I'll come back.
- Yeah, you do that.

404
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.230
Looking forward to it.

405
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.550
See what you just did there?

406
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.100
- What?
- You're a mug.

407
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.500
What?

408
00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.460
The Virgin fuckin'
Mary over there.

409
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:00.670
"I'll come back."

410
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.400
Yeah, she would if I
showed her the goods.

411
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.070
Yeah, right.

412
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.420
Girl like that, no way.

413
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.750
Got her legs crossed real tight.

414
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.070
Fuck off.

415
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.590
Yeah, like you
two could get her.

416
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.030
Well...

417
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.770
What do you mean well?

418
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.250
Well, what?

419
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.860
That fucking look, all right.

420
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.650
All right, I bet you this.

421
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:18.600
One time offer.

422
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.430
Let's do it.

423
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.740
But I'll need proof.

424
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.630
You know what would be
really sexy is if we...

425
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.250
Just so I can watch it
later and think of you.

426
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.990
Um...

427
00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.960
We don't have to, if
you don't want to.

428
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.400
No, no, it's fine.

429
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.000
I've just never...

430
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.620
It would just be for you, right?

431
00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.750
Yeah.

432
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:03.700
Of course.

433
00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.230
Okay.

434
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.810
Do you have a um, um...

435
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.490
I really like you,
you know, Hardin?

436
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:43.440
Mm hm.

437
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.820
- Hey.
- Hi.

438
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.530
I thought you were
making amends?

439
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.570
Yeah.

440
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.240
Guess that depends.

441
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.360
Depends on what?

442
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.200
You.

443
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.330
So, where are you living now?

444
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.600
Camden.

445
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.020
- Yeah, I'm back in Camden.
- Oh, I heard that you moved.

446
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.040
Yeah, I did.

447
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.940
I kinda did the whole
tour of the U.S.

448
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.380
But I'm back now.

449
00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.040
So, which one do
you like the best?

450
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.100
It's gotta be this one.

451
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.700
Oh, come on.

452
00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.230
Here, try this.

453
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.280
It's a sour cherry liquor.

454
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.020
It's Portuguese tradition.

455
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:19.970
Go on.

456
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.110
Oh, okay.

457
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.030
Oh, you...

458
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.180
Sorry , my bad.

459
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.030
It's fine.

460
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.070
No, it's nice.

461
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.020
I like it.

462
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.490
I still prefer the whiskey.

463
00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.690
No.

464
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.820
I'm a creature of
habit, aren't I?

465
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.810
Hm.

466
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.030
So, how did you end up here?

467
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.880
I don't know if
I'll end up here.

468
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.480
Just seemed like a good
place to start over.

469
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.580
You were on your way
to uni though, no?

470
00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:04.240
No, yeah, I was, but
I lost my scholarship

471
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.720
with everything going on,

472
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.150
and I didn't have time to
apply for a student loan.

473
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.450
And it turns out my support
system was conditional.

474
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.770
So, I picked a
place that was sunny

475
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.600
and affordable where
no one knew me,

476
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:25.990
and now here I am.

477
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.860
But this part I
was not expecting.

478
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.570
I did not think I
would see you again,

479
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.650
much less have a
catch up over drinks.

480
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.520
Sorry.

481
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.310
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.480
Okay.

483
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.930
I don't really know
what else to say.

484
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.230
I'm just...

485
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.850
I know I fucked up and you
had to pay the consequences,

486
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.890
which, I mean,

487
00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.230
I really fucking wish I could
just go back and then I-

488
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.240
And what?

489
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.160
I wouldn't...

490
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.910
I'm trying.

491
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.730
I am.

492
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.870
I'm trying to be
a better person.

493
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.570
I see.

494
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.500
Right, do you want some food
to soak up all this booze?

495
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:32.610
Yeah?

496
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.400
Yeah.

497
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.850
Mm, that is delicious.

498
00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.660
I can't believe I haven't
heard these before.

499
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.400
No, this is
like the best place ever.

500
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.770
And these?

501
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.130
I forgot what these were
called, but these are so good.

502
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.690
That is my fork.

503
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.130
What?

504
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.870
I'm not gonna remember
that.

505
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.050
Salt cod fritters.

506
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.180
They're unreal.

507
00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.740
I mean, the whole
meal was amazing.

508
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.920
Right? I love the food here.

509
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.400
I mean, everything here really.

510
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.880
It's great.

511
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.230
You see?

512
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.230
You are in better
spirits already.

513
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.500
Mm mm, I'll get this.

514
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.140
- Really, are you sure?
- Definitely.

515
00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.110
Thank you.

516
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.410
Of course.

517
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:18.450
Oh, I didn't realize
how long we'd been here.

518
00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:19.360
I have to go.

519
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.370
No worries.

520
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.900
Hey, night.

521
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:25.980
All right.

522
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.550
Goodnight.

523
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.380
You know, I read your book.

524
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.600
So, what happened with Tessa?

525
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.480
I fucked that up too, again.

526
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.580
I see.

527
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.210
Hardin?

528
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.920
Hardin, wake up!

529
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.440
Wake up!

530
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.830
What have you done?

531
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.010
What do you mean?

532
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.509
With the video, the video of us!

533
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.880
You've sent it around.

534
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.040
Why would you do this? Why
would you do this to me?

535
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.100
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No. You've sent it!

536
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.760
It's been posted.

537
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.370
Everyone's seen it.

538
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.800
Do you know what
this will do to me?

539
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.680
- Fuck.
- You're a fucking liar.

540
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.010
- You're a disgusting liar.
- Nathalie!

541
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.030
Nat!

542
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.110
Disgusting.

543
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.860
Fuck!

544
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.210
Fuck!

545
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.240
James!

546
00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.380
- Fuck me, man.
- Hey!

547
00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.420
Hey, you weren't kidding
about Nathalie, bro.

548
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.130
Who did you send it to?

549
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.040
A couple guys.

550
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.040
You know, I might send
it around a little bit.

551
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.480
Why are you being
weird about it?

552
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.610
Why am I being weird?

553
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.010
You sent around a
private fucking video.

554
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.490
What the fuck is wrong with you?

555
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.660
Wrong with me?

556
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.360
You're the one who
took the bet, bro.

557
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.660
You fucking taped it.

558
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.100
This is on you, Hardin, not me.

559
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.200
Fuck.

560
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.300
Give me some of that wine.

561
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.870
- That wine.
- Just sayin',

562
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.590
I'm gonna be carrying
both of you home.

563
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.210
Babe alert, 10 o'clock.

564
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.570
I didn't think you'd make it.

565
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.970
That makes two of us.

566
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.140
And he comes bearing gifts.

567
00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.670
To whom do we owe this pleasure?

568
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.360
Mads, Freya, this is Hardin.

569
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.150
Hardin, Maddy, Freya.

570
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:52.500
You can call me Madeline.

571
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.240
Nice to meet you, Madeline.

572
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.460
No one ever calls you
Madeline, you ham.

573
00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.110
My ex did once, the French one.

574
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.540
"Madeline," yum!

575
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.470
She is always like
this, by the way,

576
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:08.940
with or without alcohol.

577
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.030
So, how do you two?

578
00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:18.560
Hardin was my first crush.

579
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.790
Hey.

580
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.820
Was I?

581
00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.100
Hm.

582
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.180
Just a crush, or?

583
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.830
Okay. Got it.

584
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.020
None of you guys are
actually from here I take it?

585
00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.250
Oh no, no one's from here.

586
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.950
We're as close to
locals as you can get.

587
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.630
All orphans.

588
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:36.980
This is a good place to come

589
00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.270
when you're running
from yourself.

590
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:39.460
- Well, that's bleak.
- Right?

591
00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.710
Oh God, look
what the tide dragged in.

592
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.510
Why does it look like a
Dolce & Gabbana plane ad?

593
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.340
I'll have a little
scratch and sniff.

594
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.380
- Oh, you are officially out.
- What?

595
00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.330
Hey there.

596
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.350
- Oh!
- Oh, God no.

597
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.640
You're gettin' me all wet.

598
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.440
Who's this?

599
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.740
Hardin.

600
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.400
Me and Nat, we grew up together.

601
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.480
Hm.

602
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.100
Grow up, shake his hand.

603
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.050
Well, this is Sebastian.

604
00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.540
Sebastian, Hardin's
in town from London.

605
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.840
He's a famous author.

606
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.850
- Wait, what?
- I wouldn't say famous.

607
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:25.890
I'm just an author...

608
00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:26.770
No?

609
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.290
Would you say bestselling?

610
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:29.810
What's one of your books?

611
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.600
There is only one, but honestly-

612
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.860
It's called "After."

613
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.250
No way I've heard of that.

614
00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:35.250
I've read that.

615
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.410
No, you haven't.

616
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:37.470
I loved it.

617
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.020
Well, as much as you
can love something

618
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.090
that makes you ugly
cry every other page.

619
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.849
I heard
they're making a movie?

620
00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:43.980
Oh, Harry Style should play you.

621
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.050
Thank you.

622
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.300
So, you're
working on anything now?

623
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.440
I'm trying, yeah.

624
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.780
What is it they say?

625
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.190
Everyone has one book in them,

626
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.540
only the talented have a second.

627
00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.190
Huh, wow.

628
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.710
Spoken like a true writer.

629
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.630
Tell me, where can I
find your body of work?

630
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.890
- The boy can keep up.
- Mm hm.

631
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.630
You ever been cliff diving, man?

632
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:08.990
No, I'm putting my foot down.

633
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.550
You are not roping
him into that.

634
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.030
What? It's fun.

635
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:13.940
It's an accident
waiting to happen.

636
00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:14.890
Come on, man.

637
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.690
Let's do it.

638
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.670
This is a bad idea.

639
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.500
Seriously Hardin, don't
let him pressure you, okay?

640
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.410
Yeah man, don't let
me pressure you.

641
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:54.460
Woo!

642
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.550
Let's go!

643
00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.600
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

644
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.730
Hardin?

645
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.120
Come up.

646
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:15.430
Just fuckin' with you.

647
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.080
Hardin, hey.

648
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.190
You okay?

649
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.130
Yeah.

650
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.020
Yeah, I will be.

651
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:01.260
Me and Nat, we uh,
we grew up together.

652
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.740
Hardin
was my first crush.

653
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.620
Hey.

654
00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.450
Not much of a morning
person, are we?

655
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.270
Just haven't had
enough coffee yet.

656
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.240
And I am definitely not a
smoothie person, but thank you.

657
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.240
How can you hate smoothies?

658
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.230
It's literally blended
fruit and a bit of veg.

659
00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:01.200
It's more about the
aesthetic, isn't it?

660
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.810
It's like a holier than thou
wellness cult kinda thing.

661
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.860
Come on, just try it.

662
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.290
Come on.

663
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.010
Mm, yeah.

664
00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:23.990
Maybe you don't know what
kind of person you are.

665
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.770
Can you do me a favor?

666
00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:47.210
Can you pull in the main sheet?

667
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.080
Pull...

668
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.160
What's the main sheet?

669
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.480
Sorry, the red one.

670
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:53.510
Pull the red line.

671
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.950
- I just pull it?
- Yes.

672
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.790
- This okay?
- Yes.

673
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.350
Good.

674
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.280
Here.

675
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.640
You look like you need water.

676
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.400
Thanks.

677
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.860
I've been stuck in my
apartment for so long.

678
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.370
Figure it's taken a toll.

679
00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:30.410
Stuck?

680
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:33.940
More like
self-contained, I guess.

681
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.920
Figured if I shut myself
away from the world

682
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.170
for long enough eventually
I'd find the words.

683
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.260
You do like to pick
things apart, don't you?

684
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.480
Oh, yeah.

685
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.390
That's how you get
to the good stuff.

686
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.960
So why do you think
you're struggling so much?

687
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.180
Second novel syndrome.

688
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:55.470
I mean, it's common
enough to have a name

689
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.090
so at least I'm
not the only one.

690
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.400
But I guess there must
be a number of reasons.

691
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.760
Like?

692
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.110
Picking things apart again?

693
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.150
Oh, yeah.

694
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.410
Well, "After" was easy.

695
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.290
I had my muse.

696
00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.600
I was inspired.

697
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.460
I could have written
thousands of pages.

698
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:18.710
It's kind of the irony
of it all, isn't it?

699
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.130
If I didn't have her, I
wouldn't have the book,

700
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.860
but if I didn't have the book,
then I would still have her.

701
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.350
Oh, she didn't like the book?

702
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:30.480
She absolutely fucking
hated the book.

703
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.360
The parts that she read, anyway.

704
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.910
It was more about
the circumstances

705
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:35.880
of how she read
them as well, but-

706
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.800
Wait, you didn't ask her
permission to write it?

707
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.320
I really thought that sharing
our story would help people

708
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.110
the same way that it helped me

709
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.070
to get through my shit
and figure things out,

710
00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:49.200
but obviously I now understand
that I shouldn't have gone

711
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.120
and published it to the
entire fucking world

712
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.850
without telling her,
I know that now.

713
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.290
I mean, it's not nice being
exposed without your consent.

714
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.870
Do you see that?

715
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.140
There?

716
00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.490
That is my dream.

717
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.850
I think I would wake
up every morning

718
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.500
with the biggest smile on
my face if that was my view.

719
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.110
Seems lonely.

720
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:45.560
Nah, not if you have the
right person share it with.

721
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:02.580

down the entire coastline.

Come on, Hardin,
have fun with us!

740
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.600
I didn't catch that.

741
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.470
Oh, I think they want
you to come and dance.

here, she was a mess.

There was nothing.

752
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.800
We spent a lot of time together
that first year talking.

not- - No, no,

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:32.400
No.

812
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.010
Yeah, you did.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:35.949

things around, can't you?

814
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.580
Poor Hardin.

815
00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.060
The miserable drunk little
victim sitting at home.

816
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.280
Honestly, I mean, I'm
surprised that you're not

817
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.500
even embarrassed by
yourself at this point.

818
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.460
It's pathetic.

819
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.030
I was hoping that you've maybe
come away, you've moved on,

820
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.930
started a clean slate, maybe?

821
00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:56.940
Move forward.

822
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:01.520
Lanny gave me this.

823
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.650
He's been trying to
get through to you.

824
00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.220
- I am trying, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

825
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.440
I am.

826
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.440
I'm fucking trying.

827
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.950
Look at yourself.

828
00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.090
Why do you think I came here?

829
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.100
I came here in the first place

830
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.450
to try and resolve my past
so I can move forward.

831
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.700
I am fucking trying.

832
00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:36.930
Maybe I need to try harder.

833
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.640
I just don't think I'll ever
move on, even if she has.

834
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.600
Has she?

835
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.170
She says so.

836
00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:46.550
So, you've talked to her?

837
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.730
It's mostly been one-sided.

838
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:53.830
She replied to the
last message saying,

839
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.170
"You should move
on, 'cause I have."

840
00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.690
I know you are gonna say,
I'm being irrational when...

841
00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:03.320
And I should just let
go but I genuinely,

842
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.710
I cannot comprehend the
thought of giving up on us.

843
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:07.670
It doesn't make sense to me.

844
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:09.010
Maybe you don't have to.

845
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.590
Maybe you can hold a space
for her in your heart

846
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.230
like I hold a
space for your mom.

847
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.240
Always.

848
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.840
It doesn't mean
that you can't go on

849
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.410
to have other great loves,

850
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.850
and live a full life.

851
00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:28.120
I don't know.

852
00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:32.640
Well, take it from
someone who does.

853
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:42.430
It's easy to believe that our
ability to love is finite,

854
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:46.050
especially when your
heart is broken.

855
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.620
But believe it or not,
slowly you will heal.

856
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.280
And your capacity for love
will grow exponentially.

857
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.030
You'll be able to keep a
space for Tessa in your heart,

858
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:03.860
for your family, for
your future children,

859
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.630
for anybody who
comes into your life.

860
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:08.080
And you never know,

861
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.070
maybe you and Tessa are
meant to be together.

862
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.430
And if that is the case,

863
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.370
then you will find your
way back to each other,

864
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:17.430
but it's not gonna
happen like this is it?

865
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:18.430
Look at you.

866
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:21.820
You go on drinking and
messing up the way you are.

867
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.300
You're right.

868
00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.970
You are, of course you're right.

869
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.230
You know, my life was
finally getting somewhere.

870
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:37.930
You know, with the book I
actually finally did something,

871
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:39.270
something I was proud of.

872
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:42.810
And then, yeah, I mean,

873
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.170
I guess it fucked up and
everything blew up in my face.

874
00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:46.640
And now the bar's
so fucking high,

875
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.120
I'll never get back there again.

876
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:50.500
I'm so scared of failing,

877
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.510
so I just end up ruining
everything instead.

878
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.870
It's pathetic.

879
00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:02.110
- You're right.
- Listen to me.

880
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:02.990
It's fucking pathetic,

881
00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:04.570
- isn't it?
- Listen.

882
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:09.140
You need to change the metrics
by which you define success.

883
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.490
You can start by
writing one page a day.

884
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.150
Just that, and that'll
be your success.

885
00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.220
And if your second book
comes out and it flunks,

886
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.980
but you've been
real and authentic,

887
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.140
then that is a success.

888
00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:28.640
Whether you end up with a
woman you have loved or not,

889
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.600
you have loved with
every cell in your being,

890
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.550
and that in and of itself
is a spectacular success.

891
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:41.470
Wow.

892
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.690
You're not bad at
this Dad stuff.

893
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:50.950
Now that for me is the
pinnacle of success.

894
00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:54.780
So, what are you gonna do?

895
00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:00.570
Could book a return flight
with me if you want.

896
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:02.970
No.

897
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.230
Thanks.

898
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.070
I'm gonna stay here for awhile.

899
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:14.410
Might sort things
through and try to write.

900
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:21.850
I love you, Son.

901
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.250
Really love you.

902
00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.430
I always have.

903
00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.690
Always will.

904
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:36.180
Now, let's get some
food you fuckin' idiot.

905
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:00.740
Nathalie.

906
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.180
Sorry for dropping

907
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.840
- by uninvited.
- Good to see you.

908
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.580
It's just,
I rang the doorbell

909
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.880
and you weren't on WhatsApp

910
01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.610
and I just wanted to
see if you're okay.

911
01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:12.760
I'm fine.

912
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.500
- Should we sit?
- Yes.

913
01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.020
I brought you a
little care package.

914
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.710
I didn't think that you'd
be in a state to go out, so.

915
01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.670
This is ridiculously generous.

916
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.860
I should probably tell you
that I've stopped drinking.

917
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.470
- No.
- Yeah.

918
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:32.150
- I'm sorry, that's bad.
- It would've

919
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:33.330
been very thoughtful.

920
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:35.680
I'll have the chocolate.

921
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.660
Oh, Seb is an asshole for
attacking you like that.

922
01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:42.610
I'm so sorry.

923
01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:43.740
He had his reasons.

924
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.340
I really do wish
there was something

925
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:46.880
I could do to make it up to you.

926
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.710
Hardin, your apology,
spending this time together,

927
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.820
seeing that you've changed,
that all means something.

928
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.410
You didn't force
me to do anything.

929
01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:59.710
No, but I lied to you, Nat.

930
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.970
I didn't see it then,
but I do see it now.

931
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.280
So, I'm sorry.

932
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.080
Oh, sorry.

933
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.120
Does that hurt still?

934
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.040
Oh, okay, sorry.

935
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.040
It does hurt.

936
01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.300
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

937
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.870
- Okay?
- Yeah.

938
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:24.120
Oh, no.

939
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:29.560
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

940
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:32.610
I'm still in love with Tessa.

941
01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:38.400
I know she may have
moved on, but I haven't.

942
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.590
I do want you to know
how grateful I am though,

943
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.190
for really giving me the chance
to put what I did behind us.

944
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.470
I think it takes
a lot of bravery

945
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.600
to be so forgiving,
so thank you.

946
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:55.590
You really deserve someone who
can give you all of themself.

947
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:57.900
You really do.

948
01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.550
You're right, I do.

949
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.610
You do.

950
01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:09.250
I think you should take
this wine back, though.

951
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.130
I do.

952
01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:11.530
Let's not waste it.

953
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.010
It does look very nice, though.

954
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:16.530
Yeah, I'll enjoy that by myself.

955
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:17.880
Please do.

956
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:23.430
Hey, it's Landon.

957
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.800
Leave a message.

958
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.760
Shit.

959
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.140
Sorry, Landon, I didn't realize

960
01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.980
what time it was
over there. I just...

961
01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.670
Just calling to say
congratulations.

962
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.240
Wouldn't miss my brother's
wedding for the world.

963
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.240
I love you,

964
01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.170

Keep the change.

986
01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:48.680
They all look beautiful.

987
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.200
They all suit you
but I just think

988
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.720
that the second one is very you.

989
01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:57.080
- Yes.
- It fits you perfectly.

990
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.960
But there's a couple
more over here

991
01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.960
- if you wanna just have a look.
- Okay.

992
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.090
Hey.

993
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:03.600
Hey.

994
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.170
So, is this goodbye?

995
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.610
I fly tomorrow.

996
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.660
I just came back
to give you this.

997
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.570
It's still very much
a work in progress.

998
01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.150
I haven't sent it
to my editor yet

999
01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.670
or anything like that, so.

1000
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.670
Don't worry, I'm
sure it's brilliant.

1001
01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:27.580
And if it isn't I'll just
pretend it is.

1002
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.850
It's just ,

1003
01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.590
you're in it,

1004
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.630
and I just wanna make sure
that you're entirely okay

1005
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.830
with everything in
there before I send it

1006
01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:46.040
to my publisher or anyone
else.

1007
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.820
Oh, so you want my permission?

1008
01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.360
I guess I'm trying

1009
01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.760
to learn from my old mistakes.

1010
01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.320
Well, I look forward
to reading it.

1011
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:07.670
Have a safe flight, okay?

1012
01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.820
Bye, Nathalie.

1013
01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:43.410
You see that?

1014
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:44.840
That is my dream.

1015
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:21.280
You look stunning.

1016
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.800
Such a beautiful bride.

1017
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.190
I still can't believe
how fast this days come.

1018
01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:29.490
What if he
doesn't show up?

1019
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.640
Ken drove him here this morning.

1020
01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.620
He would've alerted us
if there was a concern.

1021
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.260
And it's
Landon, he would never.

1022
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:40.510
Hope I'm not intruding.

1023
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:42.950
Thanks.

1024
01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:45.950
Also, the caterer's
havin' a minor meltdown.

1025
01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:47.770
Can you tell her
I'll be a minute?

1026
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:49.380
I can try.

1027
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:52.310
Okay.

1028
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:55.010
I am sure Landon is just
as nervous as you are,

1029
01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.440
but between Ken and Hardin-

1030
01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.050
Oh, if Hardin's helping

1031
01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:00.770
I should just cancel
the honeymoon now.

1032
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.710
You know, if he wasn't
Landon's brother,

1033
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:08.360
he wouldn't have been invited,
much less the best man.

1034
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.230
I'm gonna go check on things.

1035
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:17.980
So what's it been, two
years since you've seen him?

1036
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:21.730
25 months, but who's counting?

1037
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.470
Hey, Tess?

1038
01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:27.870
- Yeah, okay, coming.
- Okay.

1039
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:32.510
You ready,
Mrs. Gibson?

1040
01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:38.560
No, but I will be as
soon as I see him.

1041
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:40.390
Are you?

1042
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.010
Yeah, of course.

1043
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.420
Last chance to bail.

1044
01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.290
Me, bail?

1045
01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:00.930
You're the one who's
nervous about seeing her.

1046
01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:02.630
I'm not nervous.

1047
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:04.420
I'm fine.

1048
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:07.170
You're fine?

1049
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:09.250
She's the maid of honor,
I figured she'd show.

1050
01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:11.080
Okay, hot stuff.

1051
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.300
Go talk to her.

1052
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:56.740
You really do have an
eye for this stuff.

1053
01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.690
Thank you.

1054
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:34.490
There he is.

1055
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:35.710
Hey.

1056
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:36.880
Hey.

1057
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.100
You all right?

1058
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.010
Yeah, I'm fine.

1059
01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:49.330
Tell him.

1060
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:51.500
I am enjoying this way
too much to put him

1061
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.420
out of his misery.

1062
01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:53.720
Have mercy.

1063
01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.760
Enjoying what?

1064
01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:56.980
What?

1065
01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.200
They're not together.

1066
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.560
Landon said they're inseparable.

1067
01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.200
Yeah, like brother and sister.

1068
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.090
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, no, no-

1069
01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:12.130
He's dating a literal
neuroscientist

1070
01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:14.450
and apparently they're already
talking about marriage,

1071
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:15.620
so yes, I am sure.

1072
01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:36.290
Hey.

1073
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:38.200
I need a favor.

1074
01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:45.290
Tessa, wanna go dance?

1075
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:48.210
- Yeah.
- Yes, she does.

1076
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:49.071

When I first met Landon,

1115

- I instantly hated him.
- Oh boy.

1116
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.009

he has a beautiful,

amazing, talented wife, Nora.

1121
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:46.170

I relished in watching

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:47.910
you guys relationship unfold.

1123
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:50.960

when Nora used to come over,

1124
01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.320
Landon would go from being
the smartest guy in the room

1125
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:55.230
to being a blithering idiot

1126
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:57.120
who just couldn't string
sentences together.

1127
01:19:58.730 --> 01:19:59.570
But he found his way,

1128
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:03.530
and the next thing I knew you
were both head over heels,

1129
01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.630
walking into walls at the
thought of each other.

1130
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:08.580

1131
01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.240

half of your soul,

1134
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:22.910
until you've had to spend
your life without them.

1135
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:32.470
So, to walking into walls.

1136
