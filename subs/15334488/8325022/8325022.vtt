1
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.189
- You look stunning.

2
00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:32.492
- I still can't believe
how fast his day's come.

3
00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.174
- "Love is patient.

4
00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.108
Love is kind.

5
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.379
It does not envy and
it does not boast.

6
00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.181
It's not proud.

7
00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:57.585
It does not dishonor others.

8
00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:58.720
It's not self-seeking.

9
00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:01.856
It is not easily angered,

10
00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.725
and it keeps no
record of wrongs.

11
00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.460
Love does not delight in evil,

12
00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.564
but rejoices with the truth.

13
00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:15.036
It always protects,
always trusts,

14
00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.205
always hopes and
always perseveres.

15
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.742
Love never fails."

16
00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:29.717
But I failed us, Tess.

17
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:33.220
- How long have
you been writing about us?

18
00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.259
- After we kissed.

19
00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.795
- Are you fucking kidding me?

20
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:43.196
- Where are you going?

21
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.398
- I'm done.

22
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.900
We're just a bomb
waiting to explode.

23
00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.401
This was a wake up call.

24
00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.138
You would never let me read
what you were writing in there,

25
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.606
and now the whole world gets to!

26
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.142
- I never meant for
it to be published.

27
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.410
Fuck, this never should
have happened like this.

28
00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.945
- You accidentally wrote a book,

29
00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.781
and then you shopped it around

30
00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:02.382
to publishers without asking me.

31
00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.819
- What is the point in
everything we've been through

32
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.387
if we can't channel that into
something that helps people?

33
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.990
It's never too late.

34
00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:10.257
People can always change.

35
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.960
That is the kind of
story "After" is.

36
00:03:12.994 --> 00:03:13.795
- "After?"

37
00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.364
- It's my journey
after I met you.

38
00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:22.103
- I think that journey's over.

39
00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:30.511
- My
failure was thinking

40
00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:34.314
that I was writing
my journey, my story,

41
00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.852
but it was our story, Tess.

42
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.474
But I know our story
isn't finished.

43
00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.812
Even if you've moved on,

44
00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:05.680
I can't.

45
00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:09.316
I can't imagine my
world without you

46
00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:13.386
because without you
there is only me,

47
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.125
broken,

48
00:04:17.158 --> 00:04:17.859
lost,

49
00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:19.861
and alone.

50
00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:22.530
Without you,

51
00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:26.134
I have no after.

52
00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:44.384
- Welcome.

53
00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.020
Can I get you a table?

54
00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:47.855
- I might have one.

55
00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:48.890
- Hi, darling.

56
00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:50.892
- Katherine.

57
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.029
- It's a wonder I could
get you outta the house.

58
00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:56.764
Hopefully all that time

59
00:04:56.798 --> 00:04:58.331
you spent holed
up in there means

60
00:04:58.365 --> 00:04:59.934
you're closing in on a draft?

61
00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:02.804
- I'll do a whiskey.

62
00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:05.873
- And I'll do an Aperol spritz.

63
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:10.410
Hardin, everyone at
Dowlish is dying to see it,

64
00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:14.081
and I'm afraid I can't
keep putting people off,

65
00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:16.617
not if we're gonna make
it to print by Christmas.

66
00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:18.786
- You know, Harper
Lee didn't publish

67
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.555
her second novel
for 55 years, so-

68
00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:23.456
- People's attention spans are
like fruit flies these days.

69
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.228
You're hot right now, but we
have to ride the "After" wave.

70
00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:30.565
Otherwise it's another
10 months, two years,
whatever it is,

71
00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:32.465
they'll forget you ever existed.

72
00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:35.069
- Seems fickle.

73
00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:36.469
- Yeah, it is.

74
00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:37.972
You have a tiny
window of relevance

75
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.107
and it's dwindling every day.

76
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:41.542
- Can't rush greatness can you?

77
00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:43.077
- I can when I've given you

78
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.213
a quarter million
dollar advance.

79
00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:45.947
- It was pounds.

80
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.955
- I thought you were sober?

81
00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:57.792
- I was.

82
00:05:59.594 --> 00:06:00.895
Cheers.

83
00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:08.970
- Come on, I'm only
here for one night.

84
00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:09.871
Another round.

85
00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:13.274
- I don't think I
can keep up anymore.

86
00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:14.508
- Lightweight.

87
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.579
Nay Nay?
- Teacup?

88
00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:21.349
- God, you look amazing.

89
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.316
- I went vegan.

90
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.284
- I've been telling you.

91
00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:25.119
- Hardin, this is Naomi.

92
00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:26.287
We went to college together.

93
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.788
- Well, not exactly together.

94
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.691
- Let's take shots.

95
00:06:31.993 --> 00:06:33.527
Tequila or vodka?

96
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.998
- Cheers.

97
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.007
- Oh, that is my shit!

98
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.089
- Come on.
- Yes, come on.

99
00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:09.256
- I don't dance.

100
00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:12.927
- Relax, we'll do the dancing.

101
00:08:58.072 --> 00:08:58.906
- Let's get out of here.

102
00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:00.307
- Let's get out of here.

103
00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:10.785
- That's what I got.
- I'll never let go.

104
00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:12.253
- Let's get some music on.

105
00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:14.055
- Oh, yeah, nice flat.

106
00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:15.356
- Thank you.
- Mm hm.

107
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.165
Who's that?

108
00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:26.834
- No one.

109
00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:29.437
Could you put it back?

110
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.971
- Doesn't look like a no one.

111
00:09:31.005 --> 00:09:32.973
- Well, let me see.

112
00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:34.543
Aw, pretty.

113
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:35.643
- I said put it back.

114
00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:37.078
- Raw, raw, raw, eh?
- Feisty.

115
00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:42.183
You could do with
some loosening up.

116
00:10:05.574 --> 00:10:06.508
- Shh.

117
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:07.741
- It'll take an act of God

118
00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:10.211
to wake him after what
he drank last night.

119
00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:11.345
- Do you think he's okay?

120
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.014
- That's a nice
way of putting it.

121
00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:16.083
- Okay, he's
a hot fucking mess.

122
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:19.653
- Oh, don't even get me started.

123
00:10:19.687 --> 00:10:22.389
I mean, he's completely
lost without Tessa,

124
00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:24.225
but like, honey,

125
00:10:24.258 --> 00:10:25.392
you're never getting her back.

126
00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:30.532
- Look who's back from the dead.

127
00:10:30.565 --> 00:10:31.232
- Fuck.

128
00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:35.236
I see you've raided my closet.

129
00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:45.646
- Ibuprofen?

130
00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:52.987
- I've got a meeting so
you can let yourselves out.

131
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:56.957
- We didn't really
get a chance to talk.

132
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:04.198
I'm gonna need a rough
draft of the book ASAP.

133
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:06.767
Otherwise you're gonna have
to pay the advance back.

134
00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:10.905
- Yeah, got it.

135
00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.119
Meeting with the parents.

136
00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:26.153
This should be fun.

137
00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:28.289
- Just the hour late then.

138
00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:32.293
- I'm here now.

139
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.300
I'll have a whiskey.

140
00:11:44.606 --> 00:11:45.773
What?

141
00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:46.608
- When did you start
drinking again?

142
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:47.676
- Oh, it's fine, Mom.

143
00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:49.476
It's all in moderation,
don't worry.

144
00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:51.312
- It doesn't smell
like moderation.

145
00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:53.515
- Not that you ever did much
in the way of parenting,

146
00:11:53.548 --> 00:11:54.949
but I'm not a child.

147
00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:56.317
I can do what I want.

148
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.318
It was one night.

149
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.457
Cheers.

150
00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.193
- Cheers.

151
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:09.096
- Hair of the dog
never hurt anyone.

152
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:11.265
- Just putting off
the inevitable.

153
00:12:11.298 --> 00:12:12.333
- Not if I keep at it.

154
00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:15.936
Why are you even here, anyway?

155
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.039
You two gonna run off together?

156
00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:21.342
- Why
would you say that?

157
00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:23.444
We're both happily married.

158
00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:24.478
- Are you?

159
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.782
- Your father was-
- Wait.

160
00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:30.117
Which father are you
talking about right now?

161
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.087
- Stop being an
asshole to your mom.

162
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:35.122
I'm here meeting
some board members.

163
00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:36.890
They're talking about me opening

164
00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:40.327
a London branch of
Vance Publishing.

165
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.096
- The ever expanding empire.

166
00:12:43.264 --> 00:12:44.733
- I've heard a rumor
that you're nearly

167
00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:48.335
a year behind on delivering
your new manuscript.

168
00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.639
- Well, don't believe
everything you hear.

169
00:12:50.672 --> 00:12:51.839
- Are you lying to me?

170
00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:54.208
- No, I'm not lying.

171
00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.377
I was just giving you
some general life advice.

172
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.281
But yeah, to be
fair, in this case,

173
00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:01.849
what you hear does
happen to be true.

174
00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:04.051
- Hardin, what the fuck
is going on with you?

175
00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:06.287
We're just trying to help you.

176
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.123
We can't do that if we
don't know what's going on.

177
00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:12.259
- I don't really know
what's going on either.

178
00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:14.094
I keep on trying to write
and every time I do,

179
00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:17.498
everything just ends
up going back to Tessa.

180
00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.702
I keep rewriting the
old stuff, you know?

181
00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:22.737
The same things, what
ifs and hypotheticals

182
00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:24.038
don't really matter
in the end, do they?

183
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:25.272
Because anyway I look at it,

184
00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:27.174
she's not here and
nothing matters

185
00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:29.109
in this world if
she's not in it.

186
00:13:30.044 --> 00:13:31.412
I don't have another book in me.

187
00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:32.379
I never did.

188
00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:33.414
I think it was all a fluke.

189
00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:35.382
- And it's okay if you don't.

190
00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:36.150
- You have a gift.

191
00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:38.085
All writers go through this.

192
00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:38.586
- Do they?

193
00:13:39.754 --> 00:13:40.954
How the hell would, you know?

194
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:43.090
You haven't written a
damn thing in your life.

195
00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:47.529
- But I have spent my entire
career finding diamonds

196
00:13:47.562 --> 00:13:51.231
in the slush pile, and I
know talent when I see it.

197
00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:00.441
Look, let me get in
touch with Dowlish

198
00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:01.643
and see if I can do a deal.

199
00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:03.243
- No.
- Ease your deadline.

200
00:14:03.277 --> 00:14:05.412
You can come over to us and
take as long as you need.

201
00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:06.748
- We've been over this.

202
00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:08.717
I don't want to.
- Hardin, if you cannot-

203
00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:11.418
- Go on, just go.

204
00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:12.787
- You can't-
- Just go.

205
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:14.254
You need to.

206
00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:16.957
- I do have to go actually,
because you were late.

207
00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:23.063
- No, no, I've
got this, I've got this.

208
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.432
- Waiter, I'll have another.

209
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.602
- I'm around, all right?

210
00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:29.269
If you need me, give me a call.

211
00:14:38.646 --> 00:14:42.282
- You know, a change of scenery
might give you some good,

212
00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:45.018
might be inspiring to just
get out of her for awhile.

213
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.524
A bit a distance might
give you new perspective,

214
00:14:49.557 --> 00:14:53.661
might help you make peace with
your past so you can move on.

215
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.400
- I'm not ready to move on yet.

216
00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:03.170
- No, I know, I didn't
mean in regard to...

217
00:15:06.641 --> 00:15:07.542
I meant move forward.

218
00:15:09.143 --> 00:15:10.477
Yeah, just let go of
some of your regrets

219
00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:14.516
so you can stop dragging
them into your future.

220
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.520
I meat Nathalie over Christmas.

221
00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:21.388
She asked after you.

222
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.491
- How is she?

223
00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:27.027
- Well, we only spoke
for a couple of minutes,

224
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.362
but she seemed good.

225
00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:32.667
She moved to Lisbon.

226
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.535
- Lisbon?
- Mm.

227
00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:36.069
- Portugal.

228
00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:37.004
- I know where Lisbon is, Mom.

229
00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:38.873
I just meant...

230
00:15:38.907 --> 00:15:43.010
- Well, I guess she was
ready for a fresh start.

231
00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:12.165
- Would
you like to order a meal?

232
00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:13.267
We have two options today.

233
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.836
- I'll just do another round.

234
00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.805
Liquid lunch then.

235
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.508
- You can just keep 'em comin'.

236
00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:25.613
- Who
are you trying to forget?

237
00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:27.815
- How obvious is it?

238
00:17:28.983 --> 00:17:31.285
- Call it female intuition.

239
00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.754
Do you wanna talk about it?

240
00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.290
- Not particularly, no.

241
00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:40.093
- Well, if you change your mind,

242
00:17:40.127 --> 00:17:41.696
I will just be up there,

243
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.065
or you can press
that call button.

244
00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:20.762
- I was just fastening
your seatbelt.

245
00:19:20.795 --> 00:19:22.262
We are on our final descent.

246
00:19:24.132 --> 00:19:25.566
- We expect
an on time arrival

247
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.802
to Humberto Delgado
International Airport

248
00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:29.537
where the temperature in Lisbon

249
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.439
is currently a sunny
22 degrees Centigrade.

250
00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:33.675
On behalf of the airline,

251
00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:36.077
we hope you enjoy
your stay in Portugal,

252
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.411
and we thank your
for flying with us.

253
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.330
- This fit is just stunning.

254
00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:39.432
I mean, we can always
take it in a little bit

255
00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:42.402
if you wanted to,
but I think this...

256
00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:46.874
With the placement of the
seam, I think this is perfect.

257
00:21:46.908 --> 00:21:49.710
Just give me one moment
and I'll be right with you.

258
00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:52.914
Sorry.
- Take your time.

259
00:21:57.151 --> 00:21:58.418
- Excuse me, would you?

260
00:21:59.352 --> 00:22:00.021
- Okay.

261
00:22:03.423 --> 00:22:04.926
- What are you doing here?

262
00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.430
- Making amends.

263
00:22:12.934 --> 00:22:13.935
I was hoping to.

264
00:22:14.869 --> 00:22:17.370
- I'm in the middle
of an appointment.

265
00:22:17.404 --> 00:22:18.806
You need to leave.

266
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.141
- I don't
need long, honestly.

267
00:22:20.174 --> 00:22:21.309
I just wanted to-
- Please.

268
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.144
- I came all this
way to find you.

269
00:22:23.177 --> 00:22:24.377
- Please!

270
00:22:40.862 --> 00:22:44.098
Hi.

271
00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:38.686
- How you feelin', Hardin?

272
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.689
- Pocket kings.
- Fuck!

273
00:23:41.722 --> 00:23:42.957
- I'll be takin' that watch.

274
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.325
- Hey, man, don't
do him like that.

275
00:23:44.358 --> 00:23:45.159
His old man gave it to him.

276
00:23:45.192 --> 00:23:47.161
- What? Bet's a bet.

277
00:23:47.194 --> 00:23:48.029
- Yep.

278
00:23:48.963 --> 00:23:51.732
- It's all right,
you'll win it back.

279
00:23:51.766 --> 00:23:53.234
- I'm not stupid enough
to wager something

280
00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:54.467
I'm not willing to lose.

281
00:23:54.502 --> 00:23:56.037
- Well, he didn't
have much else to bet.

282
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.239
- Well, then he
shouldn't have played.

283
00:23:58.272 --> 00:24:00.473
Well, I dunno what else to say.

284
00:24:03.678 --> 00:24:05.546
- I'm looking for Mark.

285
00:24:07.348 --> 00:24:08.683
- It's Mark Junior,

286
00:24:08.716 --> 00:24:11.385
although little guy
doesn't like that much.

287
00:24:11.419 --> 00:24:12.687
- Anyway, if you're
looking for my old man,

288
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.955
he's gone home for the day.

289
00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:15.488
- I spoke to him on
the phone earlier

290
00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:18.693
about my car and he said
that he would take a look.

291
00:24:18.726 --> 00:24:20.561
- Okay, what do you
reckon's the problem?

292
00:24:23.397 --> 00:24:24.865
- The radiator.

293
00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:27.535
I really wouldn't know.

294
00:24:27.568 --> 00:24:30.571
It's making a awful
sound.

295
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.108
- Oh, yeah, yeah-
- That junker looks

296
00:24:34.141 --> 00:24:35.109
older than you.

297
00:24:35.142 --> 00:24:36.377
It's hardly worth fixin'.

298
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.578
Back seats look
all right, though.

299
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:38.512
- Oh, shut up, dude.

300
00:24:44.552 --> 00:24:46.654
- I'll come back.
- Yeah, you do that.

301
00:24:46.687 --> 00:24:48.222
- Looking forward to it.

302
00:24:48.255 --> 00:24:49.390
- See what you just did there?

303
00:24:49.423 --> 00:24:51.225
- What?
- You're a mug.

304
00:24:51.258 --> 00:24:52.426
- What?

305
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.395
The Virgin fuckin'
Mary over there.

306
00:24:54.428 --> 00:24:55.696
"I'll come back."

307
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.064
Yeah, she would if I
showed her the goods.

308
00:24:57.098 --> 00:24:57.698
- Yeah, right.

309
00:24:57.732 --> 00:24:59.367
Girl like that, no way.

310
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.500
Got her legs crossed real tight.

311
00:25:00.534 --> 00:25:01.902
- Fuck off.

312
00:25:01.936 --> 00:25:03.637
Yeah, like you
two could get her.

313
00:25:03.671 --> 00:25:06.073
- Well...

314
00:25:06.107 --> 00:25:07.508
- What do you mean well?

315
00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:09.243
Well, what?

316
00:25:09.276 --> 00:25:10.578
That fucking look, all right.

317
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:12.580
All right, I bet you this.

318
00:25:12.613 --> 00:25:13.581
One time offer.

319
00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:16.417
- Let's do it.

320
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:17.651
- But I'll need proof.

321
00:26:31.692 --> 00:26:35.729
- You know what would be
really sexy is if we...

322
00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:43.204
Just so I can watch it
later and think of you.

323
00:26:45.072 --> 00:26:46.006
- Um...

324
00:26:47.074 --> 00:26:49.043
- We don't have to,
if you don't want to.

325
00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:51.378
- No, no, it's fine.

326
00:26:51.412 --> 00:26:53.013
I've just never...

327
00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:56.585
It would just be for you, right?

328
00:26:56.617 --> 00:26:57.885
- Yeah.

329
00:26:57.918 --> 00:26:58.619
Of course.

330
00:27:00.054 --> 00:27:01.088
- Okay.

331
00:27:18.873 --> 00:27:20.808
Do you have a um, um...

332
00:27:35.189 --> 00:27:37.458
I really like you,
you know, Hardin?

333
00:27:37.491 --> 00:27:38.259
- Mm hm.

334
00:28:14.828 --> 00:28:15.796
- Hey.
- Hi.

335
00:28:24.805 --> 00:28:27.441
I thought you were
making amends?

336
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.476
- Yeah.

337
00:28:30.477 --> 00:28:32.279
Guess that depends.

338
00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:33.314
- Depends on what?

339
00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:35.449
- You.

340
00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:43.290
- So, where are you living now?

341
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:45.926
- Camden.

342
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.828
Yeah, I'm back in Camden.
- Oh, I heard that you moved.

343
00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:49.930
- Yeah, I did.

344
00:28:49.964 --> 00:28:51.999
I kinda did the whole
tour of the U.S.

345
00:28:54.335 --> 00:28:55.336
But I'm back now.

346
00:28:58.673 --> 00:29:02.076
- So, which one do
you like the best?

347
00:29:03.978 --> 00:29:04.812
- It's gotta be this one.

348
00:29:04.845 --> 00:29:06.380
- Oh, come on.

349
00:29:07.649 --> 00:29:10.484
Here, try this.

350
00:29:10.518 --> 00:29:12.319
It's a sour cheery liquor.

351
00:29:12.353 --> 00:29:14.121
It's Portuguese tradition.

352
00:29:14.154 --> 00:29:15.022
Go on.

353
00:29:19.193 --> 00:29:21.061
Oh, okay.

354
00:29:21.095 --> 00:29:21.829
- Oh, you...

355
00:29:21.862 --> 00:29:22.664
Sorry , my bad.

356
00:29:22.697 --> 00:29:24.131
- It's fine.

357
00:29:24.164 --> 00:29:25.165
- No, it's nice.

358
00:29:25.199 --> 00:29:26.066
I like it.

359
00:29:27.368 --> 00:29:28.402
I still prefer the whiskey.

360
00:29:28.435 --> 00:29:29.638
- No.

361
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:31.706
- I'm a creature
of habit, aren't I?

362
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.873
- Hm.

363
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:37.077
- So, how did you end up here?

364
00:29:41.882 --> 00:29:45.819
- I don't know if
I'll end up here.

365
00:29:45.853 --> 00:29:50.424
Just seemed like a good
place to start over.

366
00:29:52.694 --> 00:29:54.361
- You were on your
way to uni though, no?

367
00:29:54.395 --> 00:29:59.099
- No, yeah, I was, but
I lost my scholarship

368
00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:00.501
with everything going on,

369
00:30:00.535 --> 00:30:03.037
and I didn't have time to
apply for a student loan.

370
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.408
And it turns out my support
system was conditional.

371
00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:13.682
So, I picked a
place that was sunny

372
00:30:13.715 --> 00:30:18.520
and affordable where
no one knew me,

373
00:30:19.887 --> 00:30:21.055
and now here I am.

374
00:30:22.122 --> 00:30:23.924
But this part I
was not expecting.

375
00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:27.361
I did not think I
would see you again,

376
00:30:27.394 --> 00:30:30.565
much less have a
catch up over drinks.

377
00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:32.433
- Sorry.

378
00:30:34.435 --> 00:30:35.302
I'm sorry.

379
00:30:36.504 --> 00:30:37.438
- Okay.

380
00:30:40.007 --> 00:30:41.875
- I don't really know
what I was to say.

381
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:43.243
I'm just...

382
00:30:46.947 --> 00:30:50.785
I know I fucked up and you
had to pay the consequences,

383
00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:52.953
which, I mean,

384
00:30:54.355 --> 00:30:56.390
I really fucking wish I could
just go back and then I-

385
00:30:56.423 --> 00:30:57.257
- And what?

386
00:30:59.927 --> 00:31:01.295
- I wouldn't...

387
00:31:07.935 --> 00:31:08.603
I'm trying.

388
00:31:09.771 --> 00:31:10.638
I am.

389
00:31:11.773 --> 00:31:14.942
I'm trying to be
a better person.

390
00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:18.479
- I see.

391
00:31:21.616 --> 00:31:25.520
Right, do you want some food
to soak up all this booze?

392
00:31:26.521 --> 00:31:27.454
Yeah?

393
00:31:27.488 --> 00:31:28.389
- Yeah.

394
00:31:32.025 --> 00:31:33.595
Mm, that is delicious.

395
00:31:33.628 --> 00:31:35.295
I can't believe I haven't
heard these before.

396
00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:37.665
- No, this is
like the best place ever.

397
00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:39.133
- And these?

398
00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:40.668
I forgot what these were
called, but these are so good.

399
00:31:41.703 --> 00:31:43.671
- That is my fork.

400
00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:48.942
- What?

401
00:31:48.976 --> 00:31:51.813
I'm not gonna remember that.

402
00:31:51.846 --> 00:31:54.314
- Salt cod fritters.

403
00:31:54.348 --> 00:31:55.416
- They're unreal.

404
00:31:55.449 --> 00:31:56.684
I mean, the whole
meal was amazing.

405
00:31:56.718 --> 00:31:57.519
- Right?

406
00:31:57.552 --> 00:31:58.887
I love the food here.

407
00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.522
I mean, everything here really.

408
00:32:00.555 --> 00:32:01.823
- It's great.

409
00:32:01.856 --> 00:32:03.123
- You see?

410
00:32:03.157 --> 00:32:05.125
You are in better
spirits already.

411
00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:07.327
- Mm mm, I'll get this.

412
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:09.396
- Really, are you sure?
- Definitely.

413
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.030
- Thank you.

414
00:32:10.063 --> 00:32:11.298
- Of course.

415
00:32:11.331 --> 00:32:13.400
- Oh, I didn't realize
how long we'd been here.

416
00:32:13.434 --> 00:32:14.368
I have to go.

417
00:32:15.503 --> 00:32:16.370
- No worries.

418
00:32:18.172 --> 00:32:19.841
- Hey, night.

419
00:32:19.874 --> 00:32:20.575
All right.

420
00:32:22.577 --> 00:32:23.511
- Goodnight.

421
00:32:25.713 --> 00:32:27.214
- You know, I read your book.

422
00:32:29.049 --> 00:32:31.553
So, what happened with Tessa?

423
00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:40.461
- I fucked that up too, again.

424
00:32:43.297 --> 00:32:44.498
- I see.

425
00:33:15.395 --> 00:33:16.263
- Hardin?

426
00:33:17.097 --> 00:33:19.868
Hardin, wake up!

427
00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:21.569
Wake up!

428
00:33:21.603 --> 00:33:23.403
What have you done?

429
00:33:23.437 --> 00:33:24.404
- What do you mean?

430
00:33:24.438 --> 00:33:25.239
- With the video,
the video of us!

431
00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:26.808
You've sent it around.

432
00:33:26.841 --> 00:33:28.041
Why would you do this?

433
00:33:28.075 --> 00:33:28.910
Why would you do this to me?

434
00:33:28.943 --> 00:33:29.944
- Wait, wait, wait.

435
00:33:29.978 --> 00:33:30.912
- No.
- You've sent it!

436
00:33:30.945 --> 00:33:32.747
It's been posted.

437
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.214
Everyone's seen it.

438
00:33:34.248 --> 00:33:36.784
Do you know what
this will do to me?

439
00:33:36.818 --> 00:33:39.486
- Fuck.
- You're a fucking liar.

440
00:33:39.521 --> 00:33:40.788
You're a disgusting liar.
- Nathalie!

441
00:33:40.822 --> 00:33:41.789
Nat!

442
00:33:41.823 --> 00:33:42.891
- Disgusting.

443
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.828
- Fuck!

444
00:33:46.861 --> 00:33:48.328
Fuck!

445
00:33:48.362 --> 00:33:49.296
James!

446
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.266
- Fuck me, man.
- Hey!

447
00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:54.234
- Hey, you weren't kidding
about Nathalie, bro.

448
00:33:54.268 --> 00:33:56.069
- Who did you send it to?

449
00:33:56.103 --> 00:33:57.972
- A couple guys.

450
00:33:58.006 --> 00:34:00.008
You know, I might send
it around a little bit.

451
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.275
Why are you being
weird about it?

452
00:34:01.308 --> 00:34:03.443
- Why am I being weird?

453
00:34:03.477 --> 00:34:05.847
You sent around a
private fucking video.

454
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.214
What the fuck is wrong with you?

455
00:34:07.247 --> 00:34:08.482
- Wrong with me?

456
00:34:08.516 --> 00:34:10.250
You're the one who
took the bet, bro.

457
00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:11.485
You fucking taped it.

458
00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:14.288
- This is on you,
Hardin, not me.

459
00:34:21.996 --> 00:34:23.130
- Fuck.

460
00:35:24.124 --> 00:35:25.325
- Give me some of that wine.

461
00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:27.662
That wine.
- Just sayin',

462
00:35:27.695 --> 00:35:29.363
I'm gonna be carrying
both of you home.

463
00:35:29.396 --> 00:35:31.532
- Babe alert, 10 o'clock.

464
00:35:32.399 --> 00:35:34.836
- I didn't think you'd make it.

465
00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:35.937
- That makes two of us.

466
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.106
- And he comes bearing gifts.

467
00:35:38.138 --> 00:35:40.508
To whom do we owe this pleasure?

468
00:35:40.541 --> 00:35:43.276
- Mads, Freya, this is Hardin.

469
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.080
Hardin, Maddy, Freya.

470
00:35:46.114 --> 00:35:47.414
- You can call me Madeline.

471
00:35:47.447 --> 00:35:48.716
- Nice to meet you, Madeline.

472
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.451
- No one ever calls
you Madeline, you ham.

473
00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:54.055
- My ex did once,
the French one.

474
00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:58.559
"Madeline," yum!

475
00:35:59.627 --> 00:36:02.362
- She is always like
this, by the way,

476
00:36:02.396 --> 00:36:03.765
with or without alcohol.

477
00:36:04.431 --> 00:36:05.933
- So, how do you two?

478
00:36:09.137 --> 00:36:13.574
- Hardin was my first crush.

479
00:36:15.009 --> 00:36:15.810
- Hey.

480
00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:16.778
- Was I?

481
00:36:18.046 --> 00:36:19.047
- Hm.

482
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.181
- Just a crush, or?

483
00:36:21.214 --> 00:36:22.784
Okay. Got it.

484
00:36:23.918 --> 00:36:25.452
- None of you guys are
actually from here I take it?

485
00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:27.320
- Oh no, no one's from here.

486
00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:28.589
We're as close to
locals as you can get.

487
00:36:28.623 --> 00:36:30.424
- All orphans.

488
00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:31.592
This is a good place to come

489
00:36:31.626 --> 00:36:32.627
when you're running
from yourself.

490
00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.062
- Well, that's bleak.
- Right?

491
00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:38.432
- Oh God, look
what the tide dragged in.

492
00:36:38.465 --> 00:36:41.234
- Why does it look like a
Dolce & Gabbana plane ad?

493
00:36:41.268 --> 00:36:43.270
- I'll have a little
scratch and sniff.

494
00:36:43.303 --> 00:36:46.507
- Oh, you are officially out.
- What?

495
00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:47.441
- Hey there.

496
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.278
- Oh!
- Oh, God no.

497
00:36:51.311 --> 00:36:52.647
You're gettin' me all wet.

498
00:36:55.315 --> 00:36:56.951
- Who's this?

499
00:36:56.984 --> 00:36:57.952
- Hardin.

500
00:36:57.985 --> 00:37:01.055
Me and Nat, we grew up together.

501
00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:01.956
- Hm.

502
00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:06.326
- Grow up,
shake his hand.

503
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:11.966
- Well, this is Sebastian.

504
00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:15.435
Sebastian, Hardin's
in town from London.

505
00:37:15.469 --> 00:37:16.804
He's a famous author.

506
00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:19.874
- Wait, what?
- I wouldn't say famous.

507
00:37:19.907 --> 00:37:20.975
I'm just an author-

508
00:37:21.008 --> 00:37:21.876
- No?

509
00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:23.144
Would you say bestselling?

510
00:37:23.177 --> 00:37:24.612
- What's one of your books?

511
00:37:24.645 --> 00:37:26.480
- There is only
one, but honestly-

512
00:37:26.514 --> 00:37:27.882
- It's called "After."

513
00:37:27.915 --> 00:37:29.183
- No way I've heard of that.

514
00:37:29.217 --> 00:37:30.184
- I've read that.

515
00:37:30.218 --> 00:37:31.152
- No, you haven't.

516
00:37:31.185 --> 00:37:32.385
- I loved it.

517
00:37:32.419 --> 00:37:33.654
Well, as much as you
can love something

518
00:37:33.688 --> 00:37:35.790
that makes you ugly
cry every other page.

519
00:37:35.823 --> 00:37:37.525
- I heard
they're making a movie?

520
00:37:37.558 --> 00:37:38.826
Oh, Harry Style should play you.

521
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.827
- Thank you.

522
00:37:39.861 --> 00:37:42.362
- So, you're
working on anything now?

523
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:44.364
- I'm trying, yeah.

524
00:37:44.397 --> 00:37:45.767
- What is it they say?

525
00:37:47.034 --> 00:37:49.137
Everyone has one book in them,

526
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.304
only the talented have a second.

527
00:37:51.338 --> 00:37:53.473
- Huh, wow.

528
00:37:53.508 --> 00:37:54.809
Spoken like a true writer.

529
00:37:54.842 --> 00:37:56.744
Tell me, where can I
find your body of work?

530
00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:00.715
- The boy didn't keep up.
- Mm hm.

531
00:38:00.748 --> 00:38:02.517
- You ever been
cliff diving, man?

532
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.985
- No, I'm putting my foot down.

533
00:38:04.018 --> 00:38:05.520
You are not roping
him into that.

534
00:38:05.553 --> 00:38:06.821
- What? It's fun.

535
00:38:06.854 --> 00:38:08.890
- It's an accident
waiting to happen.

536
00:38:08.923 --> 00:38:09.791
- Come on, man.

537
00:38:12.392 --> 00:38:13.561
- Let's do it.

538
00:38:36.083 --> 00:38:37.518
- This is a bad idea.

539
00:38:37.552 --> 00:38:40.588
Seriously Hardin, don't
let him pressure you, okay?

540
00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:43.356
- Yeah man, don't
let me pressure you.

541
00:38:48.229 --> 00:38:49.597
- Woo!

542
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.231
Let's go!

543
00:38:52.332 --> 00:38:54.936
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

544
00:38:54.969 --> 00:38:56.804
- Hardin?

545
00:38:56.838 --> 00:38:57.905
- Come up.

546
00:39:08.516 --> 00:39:10.518
- Just fuckin' with you.

547
00:40:35.937 --> 00:40:37.038
- Hardin, hey.

548
00:40:41.842 --> 00:40:44.178
You okay?

549
00:40:44.211 --> 00:40:45.046
- Yeah.

550
00:40:47.548 --> 00:40:48.849
Yeah, I will be.

551
00:41:51.979 --> 00:41:56.250
Me and Nat, we uh,
we grew up together.

552
00:42:05.526 --> 00:42:08.796
- Hardin
was my first crush.

553
00:43:38.752 --> 00:43:40.589
- Hey.

554
00:43:40.621 --> 00:43:43.424
- Not much of a
morning person, are we?

555
00:43:43.457 --> 00:43:45.226
- Just haven't had
enough coffee yet.

556
00:43:46.494 --> 00:43:49.263
And I am definitely not a
smoothie person, but thank you.

557
00:43:49.296 --> 00:43:51.065
- How can you hate smoothies?

558
00:43:51.098 --> 00:43:52.900
It's literally blended
fruit and a bit of veg.

559
00:43:52.933 --> 00:43:56.036
- It's more about the
aesthetic, isn't it?

560
00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.873
It's like a holier than thou
wellness cult kinda thing.

561
00:44:03.911 --> 00:44:05.913
- Come on, just try it.

562
00:44:07.381 --> 00:44:08.149
Come on.

563
00:44:15.422 --> 00:44:16.891
Mm, yeah.

564
00:44:16.924 --> 00:44:18.726
Maybe you don't know what
kind of person you are.

565
00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:40.714
Can you do me a favor?

566
00:44:40.748 --> 00:44:42.283
Can you pull in the main sheet?

567
00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:45.152
Pull...

568
00:44:45.186 --> 00:44:45.953
- What's the main sheet?

569
00:44:45.986 --> 00:44:47.121
- Sorry, the red one.

570
00:44:47.154 --> 00:44:48.155
Pull the red line.

571
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.392
- I just pull it?
- Yes.

572
00:44:54.962 --> 00:44:56.931
- This okay?
- Yes.

573
00:44:56.964 --> 00:44:58.165
Good.

574
00:45:07.642 --> 00:45:09.310
Here.

575
00:45:09.343 --> 00:45:10.477
You look like you need water.

576
00:45:12.479 --> 00:45:13.314
- Thanks.

577
00:45:18.285 --> 00:45:21.789
I've been stuck in my
apartment for so long.

578
00:45:21.822 --> 00:45:23.157
Figure it's taken a toll.

579
00:45:24.491 --> 00:45:25.359
- Stuck?

580
00:45:27.127 --> 00:45:28.996
- More like
self-contained, I guess.

581
00:45:30.297 --> 00:45:31.966
Figured if I shut myself
away from the world

582
00:45:31.999 --> 00:45:35.269
for long enough eventually
I'd find the words.

583
00:45:35.302 --> 00:45:37.137
You do like to pick
things apart, don't you?

584
00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:38.272
- Oh, yeah.

585
00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:40.341
That's how you get
to the good stuff.

586
00:45:41.742 --> 00:45:44.011
So why do you think
you're struggling so much?

587
00:45:45.647 --> 00:45:47.181
- Second novel syndrome.

588
00:45:48.717 --> 00:45:49.984
I mean, it's common
enough to have a name

589
00:45:50.017 --> 00:45:51.519
so at least I'm
not the only one.

590
00:45:53.187 --> 00:45:55.356
But I guess there must
be a number of reasons.

591
00:45:57.091 --> 00:45:58.693
- Like?

592
00:45:58.727 --> 00:46:00.194
- Picking things apart again?

593
00:46:00.227 --> 00:46:01.161
- Oh, yeah.

594
00:46:02.997 --> 00:46:04.365
- Well, "After" was easy.

595
00:46:06.267 --> 00:46:07.334
I had my muse.

596
00:46:07.368 --> 00:46:08.369
I was inspired.

597
00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.371
I could have written
thousands of pages.

598
00:46:11.872 --> 00:46:13.240
It's kind of the irony
of it all, isn't it?

599
00:46:13.274 --> 00:46:15.510
If I didn't have her, I
wouldn't have the book,

600
00:46:15.543 --> 00:46:19.380
but if I didn't have the book,
then I would still have her.

601
00:46:20.515 --> 00:46:22.182
- Oh, she didn't like the book?

602
00:46:22.216 --> 00:46:25.486
- She absolutely
fucking hated the book.

603
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.187
The parts that she read, anyway.

604
00:46:27.221 --> 00:46:28.723
It was more about
the circumstances

605
00:46:28.757 --> 00:46:30.592
of how she read
them as well, but-

606
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:33.528
- Wait, you didn't ask her
permission to write it?

607
00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:37.164
- I really thought that sharing
our story would help people

608
00:46:37.197 --> 00:46:39.033
the same way that it helped me

609
00:46:39.066 --> 00:46:40.635
to get through my shit
and figure things out,

610
00:46:40.669 --> 00:46:44.071
but obviously I now understand
that I shouldn't have gone

611
00:46:44.104 --> 00:46:45.906
and published it to the
entire fucking world

612
00:46:45.939 --> 00:46:47.908
without telling her,
I know that now.

613
00:46:49.276 --> 00:46:53.280
- I mean, it's not nice being
exposed without your consent.

614
00:47:13.867 --> 00:47:14.935
Do you see that?

615
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:17.171
There?

616
00:47:18.906 --> 00:47:20.441
That is my dream.

617
00:47:24.411 --> 00:47:26.614
I think I would wake
up every morning

618
00:47:26.648 --> 00:47:29.450
with the biggest smile on
my face if that was my view.

619
00:47:32.252 --> 00:47:33.153
- Seems lonely.

620
00:47:35.657 --> 00:47:40.562
- Nah, not if you have the
right person share it with.

621
00:47:54.975 --> 00:47:57.645
- I don't want to lose this.

622
00:47:57.679 --> 00:47:59.146
- I don't either.

623
00:48:07.154 --> 00:48:08.757
So, are you ever gonna show me

624
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:09.758
what you're writing in there?

625
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:10.592
- I...

626
00:48:10.625 --> 00:48:12.993
Maybe, someday.

627
00:48:15.496 --> 00:48:16.363
Someday.

628
00:48:32.514 --> 00:48:33.480
Here we are, ladies.

629
00:48:33.515 --> 00:48:34.682
- Oh, yes.
- Oh!

630
00:48:34.716 --> 00:48:36.283
- Someone got some sun.

631
00:48:36.316 --> 00:48:38.986
- It's a wonder I'm
still standing actually.

632
00:48:39.019 --> 00:48:41.422
She practically dragged me
down the entire coastline.

633
00:48:41.455 --> 00:48:43.023
- Please, you make
it sound like I made

634
00:48:43.056 --> 00:48:44.458
you sail across the Atlantic.

635
00:48:44.491 --> 00:48:46.994
- Mm, let's go dance.

636
00:48:50.765 --> 00:48:51.533
- You wanna join?

637
00:48:53.033 --> 00:48:54.234
- No, you don't
have to babysit me.

638
00:48:54.268 --> 00:48:56.370
- Come on, Hardin,
have fun with us!

639
00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:00.575
- I didn't catch that.

640
00:49:00.608 --> 00:49:03.310
- Oh, I think they want
you to come and dance.

641
00:49:03.343 --> 00:49:04.978
- I think you're gonna
have to send my apologies.

642
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.558
- I
thought you left town.

643
00:49:18.058 --> 00:49:19.193
- I'm still here.

644
00:49:20.093 --> 00:49:21.028
- For how long?

645
00:49:24.732 --> 00:49:25.733
You're lucky, you know?

646
00:49:26.768 --> 00:49:27.569
- Why is that?

647
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:29.571
- She's too good.

648
00:49:31.071 --> 00:49:33.440
Definitely too good for you
after the shit you pulled.

649
00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:37.745
When she first got
here, she was a mess.

650
00:49:37.779 --> 00:49:38.580
There was nothing.

651
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:43.718
We spent a lot of time together
that first year talking.

652
00:49:48.155 --> 00:49:49.958
I know who you are.

653
00:49:50.023 --> 00:49:52.159
She never said your
name, but I can tell.

654
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:58.365
If it were up to me, you'd
be rotting in a cell.

655
00:50:05.072 --> 00:50:06.373
- What did you say to him?

656
00:50:13.146 --> 00:50:14.481
- Whiskey, a shot.

657
00:50:14.516 --> 00:50:16.283
- Yes, Sir.

658
00:50:18.753 --> 00:50:19.654
- Again.

659
00:50:22.524 --> 00:50:23.457
- Mm hm.

660
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.134
- Come on.
- Hey!

661
00:50:34.167 --> 00:50:35.335
- No, you're not doing yourself

662
00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:38.606
any favors sitting
here drowning, okay?

663
00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:42.342
- I'll never forgive myself
for what I did to you.

664
00:50:42.376 --> 00:50:43.578
You know that?
- Hardin-

665
00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:45.112
- Never.

666
00:50:45.145 --> 00:50:46.814
- James posted it.
- Yeah-

667
00:50:46.848 --> 00:50:48.683
- It was a long time ago.

668
00:50:51.285 --> 00:50:53.021
- So you're fine now?

669
00:50:53.053 --> 00:50:54.288
You're fine?

670
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:56.624
- I have good days,
I have bad days.

671
00:50:56.658 --> 00:50:58.660
I've moved on.

672
00:50:59.694 --> 00:51:01.328
And so should you.
- Yeah.

673
00:51:23.317 --> 00:51:25.019
- I love this.
- What?

674
00:51:25.053 --> 00:51:26.253
- This, us.

675
00:51:28.488 --> 00:51:30.223
And we're always
gonna be like this,

676
00:51:30.257 --> 00:51:32.125
you know that, don't you?

677
00:51:44.338 --> 00:51:45.305
- Woo wee!

678
00:52:06.226 --> 00:52:07.327
- You like to fuck
with girls, right?

679
00:52:07.361 --> 00:52:08.529
How 'bout I fuck with you?

680
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.134
- Sebastian!

681
00:52:40.762 --> 00:52:42.329
- Get up, you little shit!

682
00:53:09.356 --> 00:53:11.959
- And the thought
of you leaving,

683
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.764
it's just getting pretty
dark in here, Tess.

684
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.807
- I'm here with you.

685
00:53:34.782 --> 00:53:38.285
- Just
when I thought it
couldn't get any worse.

686
00:53:46.127 --> 00:53:47.528
- Guess I'm over achiever.

687
00:54:03.343 --> 00:54:05.345
So, how'd you find me, Dad?

688
00:54:05.378 --> 00:54:06.581
- Your mom told me.

689
00:54:07.815 --> 00:54:09.382
Apparently she got a
call from a young lady

690
00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:11.384
that you've been
spending some time with.

691
00:54:12.252 --> 00:54:12.987
- Nathalie.

692
00:54:14.287 --> 00:54:15.556
We're not...

693
00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:16.991
She knows it's not-
- No, no,

694
00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:18.025
I didn't think it was.

695
00:54:18.059 --> 00:54:18.860
I just...

696
00:54:20.094 --> 00:54:21.629
I suppose a part
of me hoped that-

697
00:54:21.662 --> 00:54:23.363
- Oh, you hoped.

698
00:54:23.396 --> 00:54:26.234
You hoped that I was finally
fucking someone new didn't you?

699
00:54:26.266 --> 00:54:27.334
- No.

700
00:54:27.367 --> 00:54:28.803
- Yeah, you did.

701
00:54:28.836 --> 00:54:30.805
- God, you can twist
things around, can't you?

702
00:54:30.838 --> 00:54:32.472
Poor Hardin.

703
00:54:32.507 --> 00:54:35.843
The miserable drunk little
victim sitting at home.

704
00:54:35.877 --> 00:54:38.212
Honestly, I mean, I'm
surprised that you're not

705
00:54:38.246 --> 00:54:40.413
even embarrassed by
yourself at this point.

706
00:54:40.447 --> 00:54:43.184
It's pathetic.

707
00:54:43.217 --> 00:54:47.021
I was hoping that you've maybe
come away, you've moved on,

708
00:54:47.054 --> 00:54:48.890
started a clean slate, maybe?

709
00:54:50.892 --> 00:54:51.893
Move forward.

710
00:54:55.229 --> 00:54:56.429
Lanny gave me this.

711
00:54:56.463 --> 00:54:58.331
He's been trying to
get through to you.

712
00:55:03.104 --> 00:55:04.172
- I am trying, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

713
00:55:04.205 --> 00:55:05.372
- I am.

714
00:55:05.405 --> 00:55:06.373
I'm fucking trying.

715
00:55:06.406 --> 00:55:07.909
- Look at yourself.

716
00:55:09.577 --> 00:55:11.012
- Why do you think I came here?

717
00:55:12.412 --> 00:55:13.881
I came here in the first place

718
00:55:13.915 --> 00:55:17.384
to try and resolve my past
so I can move forward.

719
00:55:17.417 --> 00:55:18.719
I am fucking trying.

720
00:55:30.998 --> 00:55:31.899
Maybe I need to try harder.

721
00:55:34.769 --> 00:55:37.738
I just don't think I'll ever
move on, even if she has.

722
00:55:37.772 --> 00:55:38.371
- Has she?

723
00:55:38.405 --> 00:55:40.141
- She says so.

724
00:55:40.174 --> 00:55:41.609
- So, you've talked to her?

725
00:55:44.178 --> 00:55:45.746
- It's mostly been one-sided.

726
00:55:46.948 --> 00:55:48.683
She replied to the
last message saying,

727
00:55:48.716 --> 00:55:51.085
"You should move
on, 'cause I have."

728
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.421
I know you are gonna say,
I'm being irrational when...

729
00:55:54.454 --> 00:55:58.092
And I should just let
go but I genuinely,

730
00:55:58.125 --> 00:56:00.595
I cannot comprehend the
thought of giving up on us.

731
00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:02.563
It doesn't make sense to me.

732
00:56:02.597 --> 00:56:03.965
- Maybe you don't have to.

733
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.501
Maybe you can hold a space
for her in your heart

734
00:56:08.536 --> 00:56:10.137
like I hold a
space for your mom.

735
00:56:11.806 --> 00:56:13.174
Always.

736
00:56:13.207 --> 00:56:14.609
It doesn't mean
that you can't go on

737
00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:16.510
to have other great loves,

738
00:56:17.511 --> 00:56:18.846
and live a full life.

739
00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:22.917
- I don't know.

740
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:27.688
- Well, take it from
someone who does.

741
00:56:32.193 --> 00:56:37.497
It's easy to believe that our
ability to love is finite,

742
00:56:39.233 --> 00:56:41.002
especially when your
heart is broken.

743
00:56:42.336 --> 00:56:46.674
But believe it or not,
slowly you will heal.

744
00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:53.047
And your capacity for love
will grow exponentially.

745
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.950
You'll be able to keep a
space for Tessa in your heart,

746
00:56:55.983 --> 00:56:58.719
for your family, for
your future children,

747
00:56:58.753 --> 00:57:00.688
for anybody who
comes into your life.

748
00:57:01.856 --> 00:57:02.857
And you never know,

749
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:06.027
maybe you and Tessa are
meant to be together.

750
00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:08.495
And if that is the case,

751
00:57:08.529 --> 00:57:09.964
then you will find your
way back to each other,

752
00:57:09.997 --> 00:57:12.400
but it's not gonna
happen like this is it?

753
00:57:12.432 --> 00:57:13.167
Look at you.

754
00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:16.771
You go on drinking and
messing up the way you are.

755
00:57:21.342 --> 00:57:22.043
- You're right.

756
00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:26.814
You are, of course you're right.

757
00:57:26.847 --> 00:57:30.017
You know, my life was
finally getting somewhere.

758
00:57:30.051 --> 00:57:32.987
You know, with the book I
actually finally did something,

759
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.188
something I was proud of.

760
00:57:36.123 --> 00:57:37.725
And then, yeah, I mean,

761
00:57:37.758 --> 00:57:39.927
I guess it fucked up and
everything blew up in my face.

762
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:41.562
And now the bar's
so fucking high,

763
00:57:41.595 --> 00:57:43.064
I'll never get back there again.

764
00:57:44.065 --> 00:57:45.599
- I'm so scared of failing,

765
00:57:47.101 --> 00:57:49.203
so I just end up ruining
everything instead.

766
00:57:54.909 --> 00:57:55.743
It's pathetic.

767
00:57:55.776 --> 00:57:56.978
You're right.
- Listen to me.

768
00:57:57.011 --> 00:57:57.979
- It's fucking pathetic,

769
00:57:58.012 --> 00:57:59.313
isn't it?
- Listen.

770
00:57:59.347 --> 00:58:04.251
You need to change the metrics
by which you define success.

771
00:58:04.285 --> 00:58:08.422
You can start by
writing one page a day.

772
00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:11.392
Just that, and that'll
be your success.

773
00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:12.860
And if your second book
comes out and it flunks,

774
00:58:12.893 --> 00:58:15.730
but you've been
real and authentic,

775
00:58:15.763 --> 00:58:17.098
then that is a success.

776
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:23.571
Whether you end up with a
woman you have loved or not,

777
00:58:23.604 --> 00:58:26.540
you have loved with
every cell in your being,

778
00:58:26.574 --> 00:58:29.643
and that in and of itself
is a spectacular success.

779
00:58:35.483 --> 00:58:36.217
- Wow.

780
00:58:38.786 --> 00:58:40.521
You're not bad at
this Dad stuff.

781
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.960
- Now that for me is
the pinnacle of success.

782
00:58:48.429 --> 00:58:49.797
So, what are you gonna do?

783
00:58:52.033 --> 00:58:55.636
Could book a return flight
with me if you want.

784
00:58:57.038 --> 00:58:57.972
- No.

785
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:03.144
Thanks.

786
00:59:04.378 --> 00:59:05.913
I'm gonna stay here for awhile.

787
00:59:05.946 --> 00:59:09.316
Might sort things
through and try to write.

788
00:59:15.623 --> 00:59:16.891
- I love you, Son.

789
00:59:19.326 --> 00:59:20.161
Really love you.

790
00:59:22.463 --> 00:59:23.164
I always have.

791
00:59:24.899 --> 00:59:25.633
Always will.

792
00:59:28.669 --> 00:59:31.005
Now, let's get some
food you fuckin' idiot.

793
01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:55.422
- Nathalie.

794
01:00:57.825 --> 01:00:59.026
- Sorry for dropping

795
01:00:59.059 --> 01:01:00.761
by uninvited.
- Good to see you.

796
01:01:00.794 --> 01:01:03.532
- It's just,
I rang the doorbell

797
01:01:03.565 --> 01:01:04.798
and you weren't on WhatsApp

798
01:01:04.832 --> 01:01:06.400
and I just wanted to
see if you're okay.

799
01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:07.701
- I'm fine.

800
01:01:07.735 --> 01:01:09.470
Should we sit?
- Yes.

801
01:01:09.503 --> 01:01:12.039
- I brought you a
little care package.

802
01:01:12.072 --> 01:01:14.808
I didn't think that you'd
be in a state to go out, so.

803
01:01:16.076 --> 01:01:18.746
- This is ridiculously generous.

804
01:01:21.015 --> 01:01:23.552
I should probably tell you
that I've stopped drinking.

805
01:01:23.585 --> 01:01:25.452
- No.
- Yeah.

806
01:01:25.486 --> 01:01:26.887
- I'm sorry, that's bad.
- It would've

807
01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:28.289
been very thoughtful.

808
01:01:29.456 --> 01:01:30.758
I'll have the chocolate.

809
01:01:33.327 --> 01:01:36.598
- Oh, Seb is an asshole for
attacking you like that.

810
01:01:36.631 --> 01:01:37.566
I'm so sorry.

811
01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:39.066
- He had his reasons.

812
01:01:39.099 --> 01:01:40.034
I really do wish
there was something

813
01:01:40.067 --> 01:01:41.802
I could do to make it up to you.

814
01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:46.440
- Hardin, your apology,
spending this time together,

815
01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:48.842
seeing that you've changed,
that all means something.

816
01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:51.580
You didn't force
me to do anything.

817
01:01:51.613 --> 01:01:54.782
- No, but I lied to you, Nat.

818
01:01:58.118 --> 01:02:01.021
I didn't see it then,
but I do see it now.

819
01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:04.225
So, I'm sorry.

820
01:02:07.228 --> 01:02:07.828
- Oh, sorry.

821
01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:09.129
Does that hurt still?

822
01:02:09.163 --> 01:02:10.130
Oh, okay, sorry.

823
01:02:10.164 --> 01:02:10.931
It does hurt.

824
01:02:10.965 --> 01:02:12.333
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

825
01:02:12.366 --> 01:02:14.001
Okay?
- Yeah.

826
01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:19.139
Oh, no.

827
01:02:22.343 --> 01:02:24.478
I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

828
01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.515
I'm still in love with Tessa.

829
01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:33.354
I know she may have
moved on, but I haven't.

830
01:02:34.888 --> 01:02:37.358
I do want you to know
how grateful I am though,

831
01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:41.195
for really giving me the chance
to put what I did behind us.

832
01:02:42.463 --> 01:02:43.531
I think it takes
a lot of bravery

833
01:02:43.565 --> 01:02:47.702
to be so forgiving,
so thank you.

834
01:02:47.736 --> 01:02:50.505
You really deserve someone who
can give you all of themself.

835
01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:52.373
You really do.

836
01:02:54.408 --> 01:02:55.476
- You're right, I do.

837
01:02:59.413 --> 01:03:00.582
- You do.

838
01:03:02.483 --> 01:03:04.418
I think you should take
this wine back, though.

839
01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:05.252
- I do.

840
01:03:05.286 --> 01:03:06.521
Let's not waste it.

841
01:03:06.554 --> 01:03:07.522
- It does look
very nice, though.

842
01:03:09.957 --> 01:03:11.526
- Yeah, I'll enjoy
that by myself.

843
01:03:11.559 --> 01:03:12.826
- Please do.

844
01:03:17.097 --> 01:03:18.399
- Hey, it's Landon.

845
01:03:18.432 --> 01:03:19.734
Leave a message.

846
01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:23.003
- Shit.

847
01:03:23.037 --> 01:03:24.773
Sorry Landon, I didn't realize
what time it was over there.

848
01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:26.006
I just...

849
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.575
Just calling to say
congratulations.

850
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:31.245
Wouldn't miss my brother's
wedding for the world.

851
01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:33.247
I love you,

852
01:03:34.815 --> 01:03:36.050
but don't quote me on that.

853
01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:34.669
- Just that green one.

854
01:05:34.702 --> 01:05:36.303
Thank you.

855
01:05:36.336 --> 01:05:38.540
Keep the change.

856
01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:43.678
- They all look beautiful.

857
01:05:43.711 --> 01:05:45.045
They all suit you
but I just think

858
01:05:45.078 --> 01:05:47.649
that the second one is very you.

859
01:05:48.883 --> 01:05:52.019
- Yes.
- It fits you perfectly.

860
01:05:52.052 --> 01:05:53.922
But there's a couple
more over here

861
01:05:53.954 --> 01:05:55.924
if you wanna just have a look.
- Okay.

862
01:05:55.956 --> 01:05:57.024
- Hey.

863
01:05:57.057 --> 01:05:58.560
- Hey.

864
01:05:59.928 --> 01:06:02.229
So, is this goodbye?

865
01:06:03.631 --> 01:06:04.566
- I fly tomorrow.

866
01:06:06.066 --> 01:06:07.602
I just came back
to give you this.

867
01:06:12.874 --> 01:06:14.776
It's still very much
a work in progress.

868
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:15.944
I haven't sent it
to my editor yet

869
01:06:15.976 --> 01:06:17.411
or anything like that, so.

870
01:06:17.444 --> 01:06:19.480
- Don't worry, I'm
sure it's brilliant.

871
01:06:20.682 --> 01:06:22.382
And if it isn't I'll just
pretend it is.

872
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:25.319
- It's just ,

873
01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:32.292
you're in it,

874
01:06:34.596 --> 01:06:36.296
and I just wanna make sure
that you're entirely okay

875
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:38.600
with everything in
there before I send it

876
01:06:38.633 --> 01:06:40.702
to my publisher or anyone
else.

877
01:06:42.904 --> 01:06:44.739
- Oh, so you want my permission?

878
01:06:47.107 --> 01:06:49.243
- I guess I'm trying

879
01:06:49.276 --> 01:06:50.612
to learn from my old mistakes.

880
01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.415
- Well, I look
forward to reading it.

881
01:07:00.622 --> 01:07:02.624
Have a safe flight, okay?

882
01:07:10.097 --> 01:07:11.331
- Bye, Nathalie.

883
01:10:36.503 --> 01:10:38.338
- You see that?

884
01:10:38.371 --> 01:10:39.841
That is my dream.

885
01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:16.210
- You look stunning.

886
01:11:16.244 --> 01:11:18.646
Such a beautiful bride.

887
01:11:18.679 --> 01:11:21.281
- I still can't believe
how fast his days come.

888
01:11:22.717 --> 01:11:24.552
- What if
he doesn't show up?

889
01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:27.522
- Ken drove him
here this morning.

890
01:11:27.555 --> 01:11:29.356
He would've alerted us
if there was a concern.

891
01:11:29.389 --> 01:11:31.192
- And it's
Landon, he would never.

892
01:11:34.228 --> 01:11:35.563
- Hope I'm not intruding.

893
01:11:36.363 --> 01:11:37.765
- Thanks.

894
01:11:37.799 --> 01:11:40.768
- Also, the caterer's
havin' a minor meltdown.

895
01:11:40.802 --> 01:11:42.770
- Can you tell her
I'll be a minute?

896
01:11:43.738 --> 01:11:44.605
- I can try.

897
01:11:45.873 --> 01:11:47.275
- Okay.

898
01:11:47.307 --> 01:11:50.011
- I am sure Landon is just
as nervous as you are,

899
01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:52.379
but between Ken and Hardin-

900
01:11:52.412 --> 01:11:53.714
- Oh, if Hardin's helping

901
01:11:53.748 --> 01:11:55.650
I should just cancel
the honeymoon now.

902
01:11:58.418 --> 01:12:00.588
You know, if he wasn't
Landon's brother,

903
01:12:00.621 --> 01:12:03.456
he wouldn't have been invited,
much less the best man.

904
01:12:04.725 --> 01:12:07.327
- I'm gonna go check on things.

905
01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:12.934
- So what's it been, two
years since you've seen him?

906
01:12:14.635 --> 01:12:16.804
- 25 months, but who's counting?

907
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.407
- Hey, Tess?

908
01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.910
- Yeah, okay, coming.
- Okay.

909
01:12:25.746 --> 01:12:27.582
- You
ready, Mrs. Gibson?

910
01:12:28.649 --> 01:12:33.621
- No, but I will be
as soon as I see him.

911
01:12:34.288 --> 01:12:35.422
Are you?

912
01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:41.963
- Yeah, of course.

913
01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:51.371
- Last chance to bail.

914
01:12:51.404 --> 01:12:53.307
- Me, bail?

915
01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:55.676
You're the one who's
nervous about seeing her.

916
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:57.678
- I'm not nervous.

917
01:12:58.346 --> 01:12:59.479
I'm fine.

918
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.949
- You're fine?

919
01:13:01.983 --> 01:13:04.285
- She's the maid of honor,
I figured she'd show.

920
01:13:04.318 --> 01:13:06.087
- Okay, hot stuff.

921
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.255
Go talk to her.

922
01:13:47.962 --> 01:13:51.832
- You really do have
an eye for this stuff.

923
01:13:51.866 --> 01:13:52.600
- Thank you.

924
01:15:28.329 --> 01:15:29.864
- There he is.

925
01:15:29.897 --> 01:15:30.831
- Hey.

926
01:15:30.865 --> 01:15:31.966
- Hey.

927
01:15:31.999 --> 01:15:33.234
- You all right?

928
01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:34.635
- Yeah, I'm fine.

929
01:15:42.977 --> 01:15:44.111
- Tell him.

930
01:15:44.145 --> 01:15:46.447
- I am enjoying this
way too much to put him

931
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.348
out of his misery.

932
01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:48.649
- Have mercy.

933
01:15:48.682 --> 01:15:49.817
- Enjoying what?

934
01:15:51.052 --> 01:15:51.986
What?

935
01:15:52.787 --> 01:15:54.155
- They're not together.

936
01:15:55.956 --> 01:15:57.526
- Landon said
they're inseparable.

937
01:15:57.558 --> 01:16:00.161
- Yeah, like brother and sister.

938
01:16:03.831 --> 01:16:04.965
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, no, no-

939
01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:06.967
- He's dating a
literal neuroscientist

940
01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:09.303
and apparently they're already
talking about marriage,

941
01:16:09.336 --> 01:16:10.571
so yes, I am sure.

942
01:16:29.558 --> 01:16:31.292
- Hey.

943
01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:33.227
I need a favor.

944
01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:40.234
- Tessa, wanna go dance?

945
01:16:41.836 --> 01:16:43.337
- Yeah.
- Yes, she does.

946
01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:44.171
- Yeah, sure.

947
01:17:08.762 --> 01:17:11.332
- Thought I'd save you.
- Hey.

948
01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:12.233
- He's a bit short.

949
01:17:13.568 --> 01:17:15.102
Terrible dancer, too.

950
01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:20.407
- He told me you bribed him.

951
01:17:42.096 --> 01:17:43.397
- You look well.

952
01:17:47.134 --> 01:17:48.068
- Well?

953
01:17:49.737 --> 01:17:52.907
- Good, handsome,
very hot.

954
01:17:59.113 --> 01:18:02.449
- You are always the most
beautiful woman in the room.

955
01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:10.291
I owe you an apology.

956
01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:13.961
I never meant to
publicly embarrass you

957
01:18:13.994 --> 01:18:15.162
after writing "After,"

958
01:18:15.196 --> 01:18:17.431
and I'm so sorry.
- I know, I know.

959
01:18:17.464 --> 01:18:19.400
- It was wrong to publish
it without your permission

960
01:18:19.433 --> 01:18:20.935
and I know that now.

961
01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:23.804
I really hurt you,
Tess, and I'm sorry.

962
01:18:27.007 --> 01:18:28.309
- I'm really proud of you.

963
01:18:31.812 --> 01:18:32.947
- Thank you.

964
01:18:38.152 --> 01:18:41.789
- Will everyone
please take your seats?

965
01:18:41.822 --> 01:18:44.158
It's time for the toasts.

966
01:18:47.228 --> 01:18:49.631
- For my 21st.

967
01:18:49.664 --> 01:18:50.798
It's the only one.

968
01:18:55.169 --> 01:18:56.070
- Hardin?

969
01:19:01.842 --> 01:19:04.478
- You know I almost didn't
take this best man gig

970
01:19:04.512 --> 01:19:06.347
because I knew I'd
have to do this

971
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:09.416
and gush about my feelings
for the two of you.

972
01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:12.152
And we all know I hate
to divulge these days.

973
01:19:14.589 --> 01:19:16.625
- All right, get to the point.

974
01:19:18.025 --> 01:19:19.460
- When I first met Landon,

975
01:19:20.861 --> 01:19:22.731
I instantly hated him.

976
01:19:22.763 --> 01:19:23.565
- Oh boy.

977
01:19:23.598 --> 01:19:24.832
- And I was jealous.

978
01:19:24.865 --> 01:19:25.799
He had everything I
ever wanted in life.

979
01:19:25.833 --> 01:19:27.868
He has a loving family, I mean,

980
01:19:27.901 --> 01:19:29.370
he had plans for his future.

981
01:19:30.672 --> 01:19:33.841
And well, now, now
he has a beautiful,

982
01:19:33.874 --> 01:19:35.843
amazing, talented wife, Nora.

983
01:19:37.845 --> 01:19:41.048
But I have to admit,
I relished in watching

984
01:19:41.081 --> 01:19:42.850
you guys relationship unfold.

985
01:19:42.883 --> 01:19:45.886
At the start
when Nora used to come over,

986
01:19:45.919 --> 01:19:48.355
Landon would go from being
the smartest guy in the room

987
01:19:48.389 --> 01:19:50.190
to being a blithering idiot

988
01:19:50.224 --> 01:19:51.825
who just couldn't string
sentences together.

989
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.395
But he found his way,

990
01:19:55.664 --> 01:19:58.399
and the next thing I knew you
were both head over heels,

991
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.604
walking into walls at the
thought of each other.

992
01:20:02.637 --> 01:20:03.404
- That did happen.

993
01:20:05.306 --> 01:20:08.108
- You two will never
know how lucky you are

994
01:20:08.142 --> 01:20:09.176
to spend the rest of your loves

995
01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:11.145
with the other
half of your soul,

996
01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:17.851
until you've had to spend
your life without them.

997
01:20:23.424 --> 01:20:27.428
So, to walking into walls.

998
01:20:29.096 --> 01:20:30.431
Congratulations, guys.

999
01:20:32.099 --> 01:20:34.569
Nora, you've made an
excellent choice with this...

1000
01:20:34.602 --> 01:20:36.738
With this guy and
I love you both.

1001
01:20:36.771 --> 01:20:38.205
Thanks.

1002
01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:42.943
- Cheers.

1003
01:21:09.136 --> 01:21:11.472
- You can't just talk
about us like that.

1004
01:21:14.975 --> 01:21:16.110
About our souls.

1005
01:21:17.177 --> 01:21:18.112
- Why not?

1006
01:21:19.814 --> 01:21:21.482
- Because...

1007
01:21:22.983 --> 01:21:24.485
Because it's too hard.

1008
01:21:26.487 --> 01:21:29.490
Because you do it all the
time in interviews and...

1009
01:21:30.991 --> 01:21:31.892
- I'm sorry.

1010
01:21:34.194 --> 01:21:36.463
I've just been trying
to get your attention.

1011
01:21:48.142 --> 01:21:50.244
- You really piss me off.

1012
01:22:00.688 --> 01:22:01.989
- Are you sure?

1013
01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:36.618
- I love you.
- How 'bout that?

1014
01:23:40.254 --> 01:23:41.923
Oh, Tessa.

1015
01:24:31.706 --> 01:24:32.840
- We're a mess.

1016
01:24:34.341 --> 01:24:36.276
- You know, I'm beginning
to think we're not.

1017
01:24:52.894 --> 01:24:54.696
- Can I say something?

1018
01:24:55.697 --> 01:24:57.699
- Since when do you ask?

1019
01:25:00.535 --> 01:25:02.169
- I'm sorry that I
pulled away from you

1020
01:25:02.202 --> 01:25:04.706
after I read your manuscript.

1021
01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:08.342
- Tess, I didn't
handle it right.

1022
01:25:11.946 --> 01:25:13.146
- I was just so worried

1023
01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:16.416
what people would
think about me, or us.

1024
01:25:27.294 --> 01:25:28.730
But I choose you.

1025
01:25:33.266 --> 01:25:35.069
We're inevitable.

1026
01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:38.640
- Yeah, we are.

1027
01:25:40.074 --> 01:25:41.208
We are.

1028
01:25:44.746 --> 01:25:46.446
I can't imagine
living another moment

1029
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.716
on this earth without
you by my side, Tess.

1030
01:25:49.817 --> 01:25:52.219
I fucking love you, so much.

1031
01:25:52.252 --> 01:25:53.420
I wanna marry you.

1032
01:25:53.453 --> 01:25:54.055
Do you...

1033
01:26:25.586 --> 01:26:30.625
Theresa Lynn Young,

1034
01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:32.894
will you marry me?

1035
01:26:34.494 --> 01:26:35.429
Yeah?

1036
01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.802
Yeah?

1037
01:26:49.342 --> 01:26:52.980
- Some day.

1038
01:26:56.483 --> 01:26:57.417
- Yeah, yeah, we'll
go somewhere nice

1039
01:26:57.451 --> 01:26:59.319
to eat when you get here.

1040
01:27:00.121 --> 01:27:01.354
Okay, sounds good.

1041
01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:04.592
All right then, Mom,
well, have a safe flight.

1042
01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:05.827
I love you lots
and see you soon.

1043
01:27:07.161 --> 01:27:08.830
All right, buh-bye.

1044
01:27:17.237 --> 01:27:18.338
I'm home.

1045
01:27:18.371 --> 01:27:19.640
- Hi.

1046
01:27:22.009 --> 01:27:22.844
- Hiya.
