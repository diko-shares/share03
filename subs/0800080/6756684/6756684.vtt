172
00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:44.060
And while you're at it,
I...

173
00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.167
I got just the place
for you to start.

174
00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:57.608
Barton, do you still
work here or not?

175
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.444
Barton?

176
00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:15.600
That's what I figured
you'd decide.

177
00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:28.603
HARLAN:
I want you to pull everything
out of this room,

178
00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:31.081
starting with
the big boxes over there.

179
00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:34.251
Then I want you
to scrub the room.

180
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.948
And then I want you
to inventory all this gear.

181
00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:38.512
(SIGHING)

182
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.183
You're the boss.

183
00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:46.662
That's right.
I'm the boss.

184
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.570
What's the matter?
You worried?

185
00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.109
I mean, a smart guy
like you, huh?

186
00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:01.442
You're always spouting off
about education to Sam.

187
00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:04.345
Now's your chance
to show her

188
00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:07.146
how an educated man can
take a tough job like this,
you see,

189
00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:09.414
and can make it simple.

190
00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.223
Look, I'm not trying
to interfere with you
and Samantha...

191
00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:17.389
Sam is none of your business.

192
00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:23.467
You just... You just
get cracking. Go on.

193
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:36.880
You know, Barton,
I think I got you figured.

194
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.418
I mean, someone like you
doesn't come hiking

195
00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.818
all the way up here
for their health, now do they?

196
00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.954
Or was it the law?
Jealous husband?

197
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.829
Something worse?

198
00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:01.463
Too tough for you, David?
You want to quit?

199
00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:06.441
Guys like you,
you make a habit
of running away.

200
00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:10.877
I know your kind.

201
00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.618
Do you?
Yeah.

202
00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:16.282
Big shots, huh?

203
00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:19.657
Can't stand having someone
tell them what to do.

204
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.295
They have little tantrums,
Davy.

205
00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:26.428
Why don't you
let loose on me

206
00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:28.932
and just get it
out of your system?

207
00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:38.976
You're here just in time
to see college boy here
take me on, hand to hand.

208
00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.636
(BRAD LAUGHING)

209
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.203
That I want to see.

210
00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.807
Come on, you're gonna take
a punch at me, or not?

211
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.577
You won't lose your job,
not if you win.

212
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.884
You hear me?
Hey! Whoa, whoa.

213
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.390
Let's get something to eat.
Come on, Harlan.

214
00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:10.539
I'll be back to make sure
you do it right, huh?

215
00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.304
Don't forget the boxes.

216
00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:15.608
BRAD: (LAUGHING)
Harlan, you're too much.

217
00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.736

(GROWLING)

219
00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.308
What was that?

220
00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.878
You just stay
right here.

221
00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.184
David's in there, Dad.
David's in there!

222
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.702
Harlan, we got a problem.

223
00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.603
Look at the size
of that thing!

224
00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.639
(GROWLING)

225
00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.510
Just hold your ground.
I mean, there's two of us.

226
00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.015
That ain't gonna be enough.

227
00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:03.878
Look out, here he comes.
Get out of here!

228
00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:05.518

(SAMANTHA SCREAMS)

230
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.354
What about David?
Anyone see David?

231
00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:48.525
MAN 1: Must have been big!

232
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.760
MAN 2: Look at the damage.

233
00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:52.497
WOMAN:
Tore the whole place up!
Bad!

234
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:57.803
David!

235
00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:03.010
Hey, David, I thought
for sure that
whatever-it-was got you.

236
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.846
You got out just in time.
Are you all right?

237
00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:08.983
DAVID: What's going on?

238
00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.954
SAMANTHA:
They've got a meeting
going on in there.

239
00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:12.285
You know
how adults are.

240
00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:15.349
You're not gonna
let that creature
scare you off?

241
00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.725
You're not gonna leave,
are you?

242
00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:20.932
Was there much damage?

243
00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:22.364
Yes, a lot.

244
00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:28.005
CLAIRE:
I don't know, Harlan.

245
00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:32.237
As newspaper editor,
I'd love to spread this story
all over the place.

246
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:36.042
But being mayor, too,
it puts me in a bad spot.

247
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:37.673
I don't wanna
start a panic.

248
00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:38.841
Claire...

249
00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.317
I mean, Your Honor, I don't
want to sound disrespectful,
but you're nuts.

250
00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:44.412
You see, there's not enough
people left in this town
to panic!

251
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.152
Now, this creature is
exactly what Antowuk needs.

252
00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.217
It's a tourist draw
that won't stop!

253
00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:50.784
It's better than a Bigfoot!

254
00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:53.297
I mean, even while it was
tearing this place apart
I was thinking

255
00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:56.061
this thing is the answer
to our prayers, the answer!

256
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.898
I don't particularly take
to the idea of my district

257
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.767
being overrun
by a lot of weirdos

258
00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.305
out looking
for some kind of monster.

259
00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:03.034
Yeah, they're weirdos,
agreed.

260
00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:05.008
But weirdos with money
in their pockets,

261
00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:08.911
not to mention,
the nationwide news coverage
we're gonna get. Right, huh?

262
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.211
Now, think about this,
the headline.

263
00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:14.741
"A Resort Community Battles
Mountain Monster."

264
00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.686
And the story that follows...

265
00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:21.851
"Mayor Claire Murphy and
Sheriff Chuck Colton's

266
00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:26.125
"quick reactions in organizing
Antowuk's defenses

267
00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:31.101
"saves serious loss of life
and property, et cetera,
so on."

268
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.965
And we can call the thing
"The Antowuk Horror!"

269
00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:42.473
Now that will put this town
right back on the map.
I guarantee it. Huh?

270
00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:46.416
CLAIRE: Well, listen,
we surely don't have
a thing to lose.

271
00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:49.519
Okay, Harlan, come on,
let's give it a try.

272
00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.180
Oh, that's my girl!

273
00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:53.918
Look, we'll play this thing
high and wide.

274
00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:56.586
Now when Brad and me
track this thing down...

275
00:19:56.662 --> 00:20:00.621
Track? Now hold on,
Harlan, just a minute.
I'm the sheriff here.

276
00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.394
Any tracking to be done,
I should be the one
to lead the parade.

277
00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:07.598
Well, what you should be
is right here in town,
protecting life and property,

278
00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.403
and handling all those
reporters that are gonna be

279
00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:13.876
coming in to take pictures
of things.

280
00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:17.542
Well...

281
00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:20.474
You know,
we'll bag this monster

282
00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.247
and then we'll stuff him.
And then the people...

283
00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:25.848
And then the people
will stay to ski,
hunt and fish.

284
00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:27.391
COLTON: And buy.

285
00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:31.520
Sure they'll come to buy
everything and anything
Antowuk can offer.

286
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.327
I'll get down to my office
and I'll contact the wire
services.

287
00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:41.199
Young fella, I'll want
to take a statement
from you a little later.

288
00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:43.207
You keep yourself handy.

289
00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:45.933
HARLAN: Hey, Barton,

290
00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.546
you must be
faster on your feet
than I thought.

291
00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:52.277
I'm sorry about
what happened
to your place.

292
00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:54.609
It's not as bad
as it looks.

293
00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:57.382
It shouldn't take you long
to square it away.

294
00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:58.980
I'll help you, David.

295
00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:03.619
Sam, I think
I need you right now.

296
00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.526
Would you go fix me
some sandwiches?

297
00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:19.400
Look, you're not serious,
are you, about trying to
hunt that creature down?

298
00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:22.680
No, I'm not gonna try.
I'm doing it.

299
00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.911
What about Samantha?

300
00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:29.684
Sam will be just fine.

301
00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:33.224
She's been alone before
while I was out
in those hills.

302
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.055
She'll be just fine.

303
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.728
Besides, if you're so worried
about her, why don't you...

304
00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.424
Why don't you stay here at
the store and look after her?

305
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.695
Sam won't mind that.

306
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:47.268
She seems to like you,
well enough.

307
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.007
Why don't you go on
back to work?

308
00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:06.081
Here, let me help you.

309
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.319
I don't really want you
to hurt yourself.

310
00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.231
You know, I...
I tried it in the city.

311
00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:15.926
Down where you came from,
it's no luck.

312
00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:17.092
I don't fit in.

313
00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.796
Maybe you didn't
give it enough time.

314
00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.403
No. No, I gave.

315
00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:26.539
It's me.

316
00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.909
I don't belong anywhere
but right here.

317
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.278
And if we can put Antowuk
back on its feet,

318
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.786
it'll be a good place for Sam
to grow up. A real place.

319
00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:37.280
Hey, you ready to go, Harlan?

320
00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.521
Yeah, Brad,
I'll be right there.

321
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:41.925
Glad to see
you're still kicking.

322
00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:50.328
Thanks.

323
00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:58.435
You... You take care
of yourself, huh?

324
00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:09.081
Bye, Dad.

325
00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:32.707
Thank you.

326
00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:34.812
BRAD: Help, help!

327
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.713
Somebody, help!
Sheriff, get the sheriff!

328
00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:40.911
Brad, what is it?
What happened?
What's the matter, Brad?

329
00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.279
Where's Dad?

330
00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.345
Brad, where is Harlan?

331
00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.154
Out there.

332
00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:48.383
That thing,
it got him.

333
00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:51.525
CLAIRE: It got who?
Harlan? It got Harlan?

334
00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:01.872
We tracked it this far
before dark.

335
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.671
Look at the size
of this print!

336
00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:09.546
It took us by surprise.

337
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.772
We tried to fight,

338
00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:14.351
but it was too big.

339
00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:18.213
It grabbed Harlan.

340
00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:21.181
Went off through here.

341
00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:36.565
Look, I understand
why you're doing this,
but...

342
00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:38.401
What're you
talking about?

343
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:41.844
But there's more than just
yourselves to think about.

344
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.144
Yeah, this is
no place for her.

345
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.155
It's her father
that's missing,
if he's missing.

346
00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:53.350
Are you saying I lied
about all this? That we...

347
00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:56.451
I'm just saying it's a hoax.
The whole thing is a hoax.

348
00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:59.520
Where do you get off
accusing us
of such a thing?

349
00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:01.566
Samantha's father is
out there somewhere.

350
00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:03.191
He may be alive
or not. I don't know.

351
00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:08.262
But I do know saying
he's a cheat and a liar,
and me, too, is pretty low.

352
00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:11.869
And laying that kind of stuff
on Samantha is gonna be
even lower.

353
00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:14.776
It would be
if I was wrong.

354
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.178
Now how come
you're so sure
of yourself, Barton?

355
00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:20.707
Besides us, a dozen
other people in town
saw that thing.

356
00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.984
Or do you have
some kind of inside line
on this creature?

357
00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:29.853
A lot of tracks back there,
leading up toward the rocks.

358
00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:35.494
Samantha,

359
00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:38.892
we found this.

360
00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:51.505
You know, Samantha,
your daddy's mighty
good in the woods.

361
00:25:52.817 --> 00:25:55.115
He really knows
what he's doing.

362
00:25:58.123 --> 00:26:00.523
So don't you start
giving up hope.

363
00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:04.857
The sheriff's right, Sam.
We'll find him.

364
00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:10.492
Oh, Harlan's probably got
that big thing thrown
and hogtied by now.

365
00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.233
He'll be a real hero.

366
00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.499

he won't be.

it came
right through here.

one thing sure.

It's real big.

SAMANTHA: When Mom was alive,
when we were all together,

482
00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:36.356
Dad used to take us
to a mountain

483
00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:39.426
that was nearly always covered
with clouds at the top.

484
00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:41.563
He called it Sky Mountain.

485
00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:44.001

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.872

No, Samantha.

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:48.501
You're going to
have to tell me.

489
00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:51.104
It's gonna be tough enough
talking to your father
without having you along.

490
00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.082
Oh, no, you don't!
Not if I can help it.

491

Samantha, will you please
try to understand?

492
00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:58.716
If you want to help him,
you have to do as I say.

493
00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:02.353
Please.

494
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:09.862
You follow along the canyon
to just beyond
that long ridge out there.

six miles from here.

500

Just like I turned over
old Colton's jeep.

501
00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:01.482
But I'm gonna be leading
that whole search party
right up that trail,

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:03.019
and with the path
booby-trapped...

503
00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:05.078
Brad, nobody is
going to get hurt.

504
00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:08.751
Now look, you just bring them
right along that safe trail
I marked over there.

505
00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:12.523
By then I'll let them see me
and the show can begin.

Brad, nothing is gained
without a little risk,
just a little one?

507
00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:31.779
All right, get going.
And I'll see you later.

508
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.385
(RUSTLING)

509
00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.856
Somebody's coming!

510
00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:20.288
Spotted it.

511
00:38:20.364 --> 00:38:23.197
Just up ahead!
A couple of miles
from here.

512
00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:24.791
All right,
let's move.

513
00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.477
Harlan!

514
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:42.952
Harlan Bates!

515
00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:47.688
(GROWLING)

516
00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:53.386
Knock it off, Harlan!
It's me, David!

517
00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.993
Harlan, I'm coming up there!

518
00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.775
Damn it, Harlan!

519
00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.655
You know, you just wrecked
a lot of hard work.

520
00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:24.957
I suppose it doesn't matter
that I was almost killed
in the process?

521
00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.621
It would've served
you right, Barton!

522
00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:28.927
Now why don't you just
get out of here before
you foul up everything?

523
00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:31.559
No, I'm not going anywhere
until you go with me.

524
00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:34.798
Harlan, that so-called posse
back there is out for blood.

525
00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.931
And there's a professional
hunter who would just love
to kill you.

526
00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.838
I can take care of myself!

527
00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:41.739
Well, what about Samantha?

528
00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:44.406
She doesn't want
a dead father, Harlan.

529
00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:48.543
I think you said enough.
As a matter of fact,
you've said too much.

530
00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:49.847
Now get out of here!

531
00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.722
Hey! Up here!
Everybody, up here!

532
00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.956
(GRUNTING)

533
00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:01.823
You're fired, Barton.

534
00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:13.872
Yeah, he asked
for that anyway.

535
00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.353
(GROWLING)

536
00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:11.432
HENDRICKS: Son of a gun.
Two of them!

537
00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:19.704
(GROWLING)

538
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.492
Dad, Dad!

539
00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.359
(SCREAMING)

540
00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:50.601
SAMANTHA:
Dad, help me, hurry!
Dad, hurry, help!

541
00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:54.306
Dad? Dad, hurry up.

542
00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:58.177
Just hold on.
Honey, I'll get you out,
just hold on.

543
00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:05.911
Dad, help!

544
00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:10.656
Dad help! Dad!

545
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.874
Come on,
try and grab hold, Sam.

546
00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:30.607
Come on, come on.
Try, huh? A little more.

547
00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:33.980
(GRUNTS)

548
00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:38.045
SAMANTHA:
Dad, I can't hold on! Dad!

549
00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.714
HARLAN:
Try and grab hold, Sam.

550
00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:52.228
Come on.
Come on, honey, try.

551
00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.569
A little more.

552
00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:01.905
I got you, Sam!
Now the other hand,
come on.

553
00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:04.446
You're gonna be okay,
just hang on.

554
00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:06.210
Okay, baby,
I'm gonna get you.

555
00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.444
Come on.

556
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.721
(GROWLS)

557
00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:22.061
Come on, honey, try.

558
00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:24.890
You're gonna be just fine.
You're gonna be okay,
hang on.

559
00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:31.498
There, on the cliff!
That's it! Move it!

560
00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:48.957
(GROWLING)

561
00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:09.345
Now go on!
Get it over with!

562
00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.010
There it is!

563
00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:16.686
McGEE: Don't shoot,
you'll hit the old man.

564
00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:21.117
MAN 1: He is green!
MAN 2: We need a cannon
to get it!

565
00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:23.682
It's the biggest thing
I've ever seen!

566
00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:26.687
No one's gonna
believe this.

567
00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:37.238
It's a hoax.
The whole thing's a hoax.

568
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.806
What hoax?

569
00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.309
Oh, well, yeah,
this guy maybe,

570
00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:42.004
but what about that thing
we saw down there?

571
00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.706
You call that a hoax?
That was no hoax.

572
00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:47.217
And that old guy down there,
he stood right up to it.

573
00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:48.342
I'm getting an interview.

574
00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:52.913
McGEE: Wait a minute!
That man's an employee of
<i>The National Register!</i>

575
00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.687
Harlan...

576
00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:05.558
Well, we almost
got away with it.

577
00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:08.130
What're you
talking about?

578
00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:10.730
This whole town's
got itself a transfusion.

579
00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:13.243
Harlan, we're back
in business.

580
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.278
David. What about David?

581
00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:20.242
He was just up here
trying to make me understand
what I was doing.

582
00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:25.018
I think we'd better find him.
I got some apologizing to do.

583
00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:28.091
To both of you. Come on.

584
00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:45.908
SAMANTHA: David!
David, wait!

585
00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:56.412
Boy, some people
just take off without
a goodbye or anything.

586
00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:59.081
I left you a note
right in your microscope box.

587
00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.180
Sure, a note.

588
00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:05.662
"I'm sorry I can't be here
to say goodbye in person."

589
00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:07.788
Some friend
you turned out to be.

590
00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:10.356
I don't know what
I ever saw in you
to begin with.

591
00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:15.236
You're right, Samantha,
I know that.

592
00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:17.296
But, believe me,
I have to move on.

593
00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:20.342
I'm just being selfish.

594
00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.246
What are the stakes
this time?

595
00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:30.343
I win, and you stay. Okay?

596
00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:35.918
Okay.

597
00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:43.123
Paper covers rock.
You win.

598
00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:45.895
Two out of three?

599
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:47.832
Come on.

600
00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:50.497
Can't blame me
for trying.

601
00:46:56.146 --> 00:47:00.014
Hey, folks, this the way
to Antowuk, where
the monster's hanging out?

602
00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:03.052
Straight ahead. That's where
the monster is, Antowuk.

603
00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:11.187
Well, you be good
to yourself.

604
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.058
Be safe.
