00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:35.057
Darling Drusilla...

2
00:03:41.352 --> 00:03:43.631
I have existed from
the morning of the world

3
00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:47.839
and I shall exist until the last star
falls from the heavens.

4
00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.012
Although I have taken
the form of Gaius Caligula,

5
00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:53.940
I am all men
as I am no man and so...

6
00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:55.721
I am a god.

7
00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:47.967
- What's it like with Marcellus?
- What's what like?

8
00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:51.173
He's so fat!

9
00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:53.290
He's disgusting.

10
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.304
He's not.

11
00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:56.320
He's only large.

12
00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:58.986
But tiny where it counts.

13
00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:01.957
How do you know?

14
00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.537
I saw him at the baths.

15
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.898
Poor... poor Drusilla.

16
00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:14.398
You are vile.

17
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:21.104
- Hold!
- Messenger for the prince!

18
00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:22.802
- Identify yourself!
- Macro.

19
00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:27.446
- Password?
- Justice.

20
00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:49.148
Prince?

21
00:06:53.252 --> 00:06:54.385
Forgive me, prince.

22
00:06:55.977 --> 00:06:58.107
The Emperor commands you
to wait upon him.

23
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.290
What does he want?

24
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.773
A last look at you perhaps.

25
00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:03.357
He is 77.

26
00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:05.190
May he live forever.

27
00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:13.000
How is Ennia?

28
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.273
My wife lives only for the day
she can see you again, prince.

29
00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:21.940
Wait outside.

30
00:07:40.005 --> 00:07:41.679
What does all this mean?

31
00:07:42.747 --> 00:07:44.352
Take care, Little Boots.

32
00:07:45.684 --> 00:07:49.517
- Pray to Isis for me.
- I'll follow you as soon as I can.

33
00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:06.114
I hate coming back here, Macro.

34
00:08:09.117 --> 00:08:10.575
He's planning something.

35
00:08:12.372 --> 00:08:16.708
You've nothing to fear.
I command the Praetorian guards.

36
00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.773
With Tiberius, there's
always something to fear.

37
00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:21.770
Be very careful of Nerva.

38
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.903
They say he can even tell
what you're thinking.

39
00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:29.602
Nerva!

40
00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:31.411
- Prince!
- Dear friend!

41
00:08:32.101 --> 00:08:35.464
Ten years is a long time
for the Emperor to be hidden away.

42
00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:39.843
I should feel a great deal happier
if he was back in Rome where he belongs.

43
00:08:39.923 --> 00:08:41.885
Tell me, how is the Emperor?

44
00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.760
Old, like me.

45
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.523
I mean, how is his mood?

46
00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:49.760
Like the weather.

47
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.732
But the weather's good today.

48
00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:53.357
Changeable.

49
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.817
I've heard that during the last month,

50
00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:02.967
seven of my colleagues in the senate
have been put to death.

51
00:09:03.047 --> 00:09:04.118
For treason.

52
00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:07.023
Nine to be exact.

53
00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:11.065
Five of them cheated.
They killed themselves.

54
00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.959
That wasn't playing fair.

55
00:09:15.274 --> 00:09:16.898
Don't you agree, Nerva?

56
00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:20.315
They were all good men.

57
00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.273
If they were all good men, how could
their beloved Emperor find them guilty?

58
00:09:28.483 --> 00:09:30.482
You have a gift for logic, prince.

59
00:10:21.673 --> 00:10:22.898
Caligula!

60
00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:33.464
- Beloved grandfather.
- Do your dance, boy.

61
00:10:35.054 --> 00:10:37.065
- My dance?
- Yes.

62
00:10:37.145 --> 00:10:39.982
The one that you delighted the army with
when your father made you its mascot.

63
00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:41.482
Come on...

64
00:10:42.054 --> 00:10:43.315
Little Boots.

65
00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:48.190
I've forgotten it, lord.

66
00:10:48.612 --> 00:10:50.033
Oh, dance for me.

67
00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.255
Delight me.

68
00:10:53.893 --> 00:10:54.747
Dance!

69
00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:07.982
My little fishies.

70
00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:09.653
Fishies.

71
00:11:12.517 --> 00:11:14.911
Alright, my little fishies!

72
00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:15.755
Come in!

73
00:11:16.237 --> 00:11:17.607
All of you!

74
00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:16.607
Stop that!

75
00:12:40.864 --> 00:12:42.529
Out, little fishies!

76
00:12:43.049 --> 00:12:45.215
You've had enough for today!

77
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.043
- Caligula!
- Yes, my lord?

78
00:12:51.123 --> 00:12:54.188
Why do you say such monstrous
things about me at Rome?

79
00:12:54.268 --> 00:12:58.440
- I hear you often pray for my death.
- I don't, lord, ever.

80
00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.815
You do not?

81
00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:03.438
By heavens, Caesar, I swear I do not.

82
00:13:03.518 --> 00:13:05.876
You do not in...

83
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.773
in public.

84
00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:10.357
Never, lord.

85
00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.343
Remember this.

86
00:13:13.263 --> 00:13:15.398
That I have let you lived...

87
00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:20.249
so far.

88
00:13:21.898 --> 00:13:23.648
My little fishies love me.

89
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:26.982
Innocents, you see.

90
00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:32.751
I protect their innocence.

91
00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:35.452
It is the least I can do...

92
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:37.876
for it is a foul world.

93
00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:39.043
Away now!

94
00:13:42.535 --> 00:13:44.982
Nerva is scowling at us.

95
00:13:45.102 --> 00:13:46.244
Help me, Nerva.

96
00:13:47.001 --> 00:13:50.273
Help me transform this young barbarian
into a Roman Caesar.

97
00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:55.440
There have been three Roman Caesars:
Julius, Augustus and yourself.

98
00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:58.565
- Which do you want him to be?
- Best.

99
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.315
That would be your father, Augustus.

100
00:14:01.435 --> 00:14:04.982
You see, Caligula,
I'm insulted to my face.

101
00:14:07.424 --> 00:14:08.815
Nerva, dear friend,

102
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:11.440
watch out for Macro when I'm dead.

103
00:14:13.393 --> 00:14:14.679
I know.

104
00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:18.385
- He hates me...
- Because you are wise.

105
00:14:19.768 --> 00:14:21.771
Because you are good.

106
00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.535
So when I'm gone,

107
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.690
watch out for Macro.

108
00:14:29.346 --> 00:14:31.648
I've taken my precautions, Caesar.

109
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.607
What might they be?

110
00:14:41.918 --> 00:14:43.732
Heaven help Rome!

111
00:14:44.976 --> 00:14:46.232
For I'm gone.

112
00:14:48.128 --> 00:14:49.394
I am old.

113
00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:52.273
Yes, lord, but you will live forever.

114
00:14:52.353 --> 00:14:57.898
All my family are dead but you,
child Gemellus and that...

115
00:14:58.018 --> 00:14:59.565
Claudius, that uncle.

116
00:15:01.086 --> 00:15:03.446
The others struck down by fate.

117
00:15:06.103 --> 00:15:09.773
And it is fate, Little Boots,
that rules us,

118
00:15:09.893 --> 00:15:11.195
not any god.

119
00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:13.107
You are a god, lord.

120
00:15:15.673 --> 00:15:16.773
No, I'm not!

121
00:15:17.281 --> 00:15:18.835
Not even when I'm dead.

122
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.268
Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar,

123
00:15:21.348 --> 00:15:22.482
they are gods.

124
00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:26.755
So say the Senate and so
the people prefer to believe.

125
00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:28.122
Such myth they use.

126
00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:39.480
Little Boots,

127
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.273
- just look at you.
- Yes, Caesar?

128
00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:49.940
I am mercy.

129
00:15:50.402 --> 00:15:51.898
A viper...

130
00:15:52.293 --> 00:15:53.835
in Rome's bosom.

131
00:16:08.221 --> 00:16:09.065
Uncle!

132
00:16:24.263 --> 00:16:25.398
Caligula!

133
00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:29.190
Do you think this boy have been drinking?

134
00:16:30.826 --> 00:16:33.793
- I think he has, Caesar.
- So do I. Macro.

135
00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:36.148
- Yes, lord?
- Bring him more wine.

136
00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:37.636
And waste none.

137
00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:47.394
Remove your bootlaces.

138
00:17:28.793 --> 00:17:31.562
And what do they say of me at Rome?

139
00:17:31.642 --> 00:17:34.505
Oh, well, they need you, lord,
and they miss you.

140
00:17:35.011 --> 00:17:38.499
Most of my life I have given
to the Roman people.

141
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:40.565
I have fought.

142
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.065
I have given all.

143
00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:48.972
Aren't they lovely?

144
00:17:49.052 --> 00:17:50.232
Yes, lord.

145
00:17:50.352 --> 00:17:51.751
The satyrs are from Illyria.

146
00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:54.773
And... uh...

147
00:17:57.854 --> 00:17:58.887
This nymph...

148
00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:01.898
is from...
Where are you from?

149
00:18:03.852 --> 00:18:04.887
Britain, lord.

150
00:18:06.008 --> 00:18:06.834
Britain.

151
00:18:07.732 --> 00:18:10.398
- Speaking statues.
- Yes, yes.

152
00:18:10.478 --> 00:18:12.648
And they do more than speak.

153
00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:14.607
They do...

154
00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:19.190
You prefer nymphs to satyrs?

155
00:18:20.357 --> 00:18:22.148
I like both, lord.

156
00:18:22.228 --> 00:18:26.230
One needs both, yes.
To keep healthy.

157
00:18:29.477 --> 00:18:31.183
Rome is a republic

158
00:18:31.263 --> 00:18:34.273
and you and I are playing citizens.

159
00:18:34.623 --> 00:18:36.398
More confection!

160
00:19:02.102 --> 00:19:02.990
That's it.

161
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.023
That's the best of my stallions.

162
00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.534
Serve the state, Caligula,

163
00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:36.898
although the people in it
are wicked beasts.

164
00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:39.682
- But they love you, lord.
- Oh, no!

165
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.273
No.

166
00:19:41.353 --> 00:19:42.687
They fear me.

167
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.903
And that is much better.

168
00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:53.898
I have no choice, you see.

169
00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.565
No choice.

170
00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:57.482
No choice?

171
00:19:59.071 --> 00:20:01.626
All I wanted was private life.

172
00:20:02.864 --> 00:20:05.815
I did not truly want
to become Emperor,

173
00:20:05.935 --> 00:20:06.916
but I had to.

174
00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:07.732
Had to?

175
00:20:07.852 --> 00:20:11.690
If someone else had become Emperor,
I would have been killed.

176
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.773
As you will be.

177
00:20:18.996 --> 00:20:20.029
Will be?

178
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.446
Will be gra... gr...

179
00:20:51.928 --> 00:20:53.815
Will be, grandfather?

180
00:20:54.176 --> 00:20:56.824
Would be, if you were not my heir.

181
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.899
When Rome was just a city
and we were just citizens,

182
00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:03.934
known to one another.

183
00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.009
Do you see?

184
00:21:05.674 --> 00:21:10.607
My, we were frugal, good,
disciplined and dignified.

185
00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:20.953
The Romans I rule
are not what they were.

186
00:21:21.722 --> 00:21:22.906
They lust...

187
00:21:23.507 --> 00:21:26.690
they lust for power and pleasure.

188
00:21:27.001 --> 00:21:30.122
Money... the wives of other men...

189
00:21:31.098 --> 00:21:34.418
Oh, yes, I am a true moralist.

190
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.543
And stern as any Cato.

191
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.621
Fate chose me to govern swine.

192
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:45.852
In my old age
I am become a swine-herd.

193
00:21:47.646 --> 00:21:50.987
You faithless boy
has drunk enough wine.

194
00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:52.857
I think he's drunk enough, lord.

195
00:21:52.977 --> 00:21:54.107
So do I.

196
00:22:09.852 --> 00:22:12.418
Now he is happy.

197
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:16.010
Homer! You would not know that?

198
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.421
You were educated in army camps only.

199
00:22:18.501 --> 00:22:20.482
You will know enough to be a swine-herd.

200
00:22:20.562 --> 00:22:23.732
Caesar, the Senate sends
these documents for your signature.

201
00:22:23.852 --> 00:22:24.786
Of course.

202
00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:34.828
The revised list of candidates
for the Equestrian Order.

203
00:22:34.908 --> 00:22:38.331
I, Tiberius Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people...

204
00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:40.065
of Rome.

205
00:22:41.755 --> 00:22:44.483
Tax assessment, for Asia Minor,
Brescia and Gaul.

206
00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:48.927
I, Tiberius Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

207
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.065
Senator guilty of treason.

208
00:22:57.834 --> 00:23:00.765
Every senator believes himself
to be a potential Caesar,

209
00:23:00.845 --> 00:23:03.995
therefore every senator
is guilty of treason.

210
00:23:04.685 --> 00:23:06.552
In thought, if not in deed.

211
00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:11.398
The Senate is the natural enemy
of any Caesar, Little Boots.

212
00:23:11.518 --> 00:23:12.740
Remember that.

213
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.148
Traitors. Look at them.

214
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.419
Traitors.

215
00:23:20.798 --> 00:23:25.773
They offered to prove any law I made
before I made it.

216
00:23:25.893 --> 00:23:28.949
I said: "What if I go mad?
What then?"

217
00:23:31.317 --> 00:23:32.440
No answer.

218
00:23:33.314 --> 00:23:36.660
They were born to be slaves,
Germanicus, never forget that.

219
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.090
I'm not Germanicus, lord.
I'm his son, Caligula.

220
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.690
Yes. And your friend is Macro.

221
00:23:44.114 --> 00:23:48.315
- He serves you and only you, lord.
- And his wife is your friend, too.

222
00:23:48.435 --> 00:23:50.233
Is she friendly in bed?

223
00:23:51.115 --> 00:23:53.295
We must ask Macro that, lord.

224
00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:54.982
She seems friendly.

225
00:23:55.463 --> 00:23:57.482
And your sister, Drusilla...

226
00:23:58.608 --> 00:24:01.374
My sister is my sister, lord.

227
00:24:02.501 --> 00:24:05.815
I know everything
that is said and done.

228
00:24:07.128 --> 00:24:08.898
And thought.

229
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:14.982
The setting sun
and the rising moon.

230
00:24:18.768 --> 00:24:19.690
Gemellus!

231
00:24:20.207 --> 00:24:21.773
Lovely boy.

232
00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:24.429
And too young to betray me.

233
00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:26.232
Well, perhaps not too young.

234
00:24:27.653 --> 00:24:30.672
Yes. Kiss your old grandfather.

235
00:24:30.752 --> 00:24:32.623
Yes, my last grandson.

236
00:24:33.322 --> 00:24:35.860
I am your grandson, too, Caesar.

237
00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.171
By adoption.

238
00:24:38.157 --> 00:24:41.148
This is the last flesh of my flesh.

239
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:45.112
Poor boy.
What's to become of you?

240
00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:47.040
He's like a brother to me, lord.

241
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.177
Brother? You know what a brother
is in our family?

242
00:24:50.658 --> 00:24:52.871
Brother kills a brother...

243
00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:57.016
who's killed his father
who's killed his son.

244
00:24:57.096 --> 00:24:59.607
Fate. Drink, Caligula.

245
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.107
After you, dear brother.

246
00:25:14.231 --> 00:25:15.547
Poor boy.

247
00:25:16.687 --> 00:25:18.158
When I am gone...

248
00:25:19.097 --> 00:25:21.043
Caligula will kill you.

249
00:25:22.314 --> 00:25:26.593
And then someone will kill Caligula.

250
00:25:32.776 --> 00:25:33.690
Unless...

251
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.482
unless he is dead, before I am.

252
00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:40.565
You are looking not well at all!

253
00:25:56.178 --> 00:25:59.569
I, Caligula Caesar,

254
00:26:00.477 --> 00:26:04.148
command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

255
00:26:19.489 --> 00:26:23.952
<i>A brother kills a brother...
who kills his father...</i>

256
00:26:24.032 --> 00:26:25.857
<i>who kills his son...</i>

257
00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:28.135
<i>Fate...</i>

258
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:31.398
<i>And then someone must kill Caligula...</i>

259
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:37.174
He's going to kill me.

260
00:26:38.896 --> 00:26:41.353
You're safe, you're with me.

261
00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:45.177
He's going to kill us.

262
00:26:45.931 --> 00:26:48.828
Just the way he killed
our father, our mother...

263
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:50.894
and our brothers.

264
00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.346
I am not going to die.

265
00:26:59.426 --> 00:27:00.946
You won't.

266
00:27:01.026 --> 00:27:03.986
You're his heir.
There is no one else.

267
00:27:05.159 --> 00:27:06.548
Yes, there is.

268
00:27:07.619 --> 00:27:09.190
There's Gemellus...

269
00:27:10.685 --> 00:27:12.032
and Claudius.

270
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.421
Gemellus is too young,
Claudius is an idiot

271
00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:21.985
and Tiberius is old.
You will be Emperor. Soon.

272
00:27:28.844 --> 00:27:30.999
And you will be my queen.

273
00:27:31.581 --> 00:27:33.653
You can't marry your sister.

274
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:38.245
- You can in Egypt.
- But we're in Rome

275
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:40.379
and you're already promised.

276
00:27:45.135 --> 00:27:47.940
I know, to Ennia...

277
00:27:58.926 --> 00:28:00.732
It's only a bird.

278
00:28:09.223 --> 00:28:09.940
Prince?

279
00:28:11.013 --> 00:28:11.827
What is it?

280
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:13.232
My wife.

281
00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:18.648
Ennia!

282
00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:38.618
Now you are a man, Caligula.
What are you going to do?

283
00:28:39.477 --> 00:28:42.982
You must be the master
of your own destiny.

284
00:28:43.435 --> 00:28:47.148
Take it... with both hands.

285
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.985
Cretins!

286
00:29:14.065 --> 00:29:16.482
Why did you permit him to do it?

287
00:29:19.335 --> 00:29:20.565
Bind his wrists.

288
00:29:21.958 --> 00:29:23.711
Bind his wrists!

289
00:29:30.658 --> 00:29:32.690
You must not go,
you must not leave me.

290
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.523
You're my friend, my only friend.

291
00:29:35.477 --> 00:29:39.440
I've lived too long, Tiberius,
I hate my life.

292
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.561
Leave us!

293
00:29:42.312 --> 00:29:43.190
Both of you!

294
00:29:43.916 --> 00:29:46.377
The man to choose
the hour of his own death

295
00:29:46.457 --> 00:29:49.940
is the closest he will ever
come to tricking fate.

296
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:53.375
And fate decrees that when you die,

297
00:29:53.455 --> 00:29:55.104
Macro will kill me.

298
00:29:55.184 --> 00:29:57.482
I'll arrest him
and have him executed.

299
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:00.414
You can't, he controls you.

300
00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:03.815
Anyway, even with Macro dead,

301
00:30:04.447 --> 00:30:09.065
how could I go on living
with this reptile?

302
00:30:12.556 --> 00:30:15.523
You will respect my friend always,
won't you, reptile?

303
00:30:15.643 --> 00:30:18.273
I've always respected him, lord.

304
00:30:18.643 --> 00:30:22.891
- You hear?
- Tiberius, you were wise once.

305
00:30:22.971 --> 00:30:25.523
Don't taunt me. I am old.

306
00:30:26.184 --> 00:30:28.482
I watched you grow into a monster.

307
00:30:29.435 --> 00:30:32.648
One by one, I've seen
you murder your family,

308
00:30:32.768 --> 00:30:35.755
your friends,
the noblest men in Rome.

309
00:30:35.835 --> 00:30:38.890
- That is treason.
- No, it's the truth.

310
00:30:40.594 --> 00:30:43.523
I am and always have been
surrounded by enemies.

311
00:30:44.668 --> 00:30:46.232
In my own family...

312
00:30:46.969 --> 00:30:48.503
in the Senate...

313
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:50.900
You're cruel!

314
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.898
No, honest. Old men
can sometimes see the future.

315
00:30:56.647 --> 00:31:03.198
So, from evils past
and evils yet to come,

316
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:07.644
I now choose to escape.

317
00:31:17.723 --> 00:31:20.026
So these are your precautions, Nerva?

318
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:58.480
- Nerva, what's it like?
- Warm, no pain...

319
00:31:59.094 --> 00:32:01.027
just drifting away.

320
00:32:01.557 --> 00:32:03.670
- Do you see her?
- Who?

321
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.148
The goddess, Isis.

322
00:32:05.747 --> 00:32:07.739
So you're one of those who believe...

323
00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:09.541
Do you see her?

324
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.672
- No.
- Are you sure?

325
00:32:19.051 --> 00:32:23.218
You're almost dead. What's it like?
What's happening to you now?

326
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:25.280
Nothing.

327
00:32:26.037 --> 00:32:27.422
You're lying.

328
00:32:27.502 --> 00:32:30.607
You can see her.
I know you can. What is she like?

329
00:32:30.687 --> 00:32:31.677
No...

330
00:32:33.358 --> 00:32:35.082
nothing at all...

331
00:32:37.084 --> 00:32:38.107
just...

332
00:32:39.773 --> 00:32:41.073
sleep...

333
00:32:42.477 --> 00:32:43.648
Liar!

334
00:34:04.073 --> 00:34:07.699
Since Nerva died, Tiberius
has been half paralyzed.

335
00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:11.932
- They say he's close to death.
- Tiberius dies, be worse for us.

336
00:34:12.012 --> 00:34:14.857
- You love the bastard.
- Take that back!

337
00:35:04.729 --> 00:35:05.606
Prince...

338
00:35:06.219 --> 00:35:08.103
the physician Charicles.

339
00:35:27.048 --> 00:35:28.476
How is the Emperor?

340
00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:30.857
How long will he last?

341
00:35:30.977 --> 00:35:33.732
Well, it could happen any moment,
but with care

342
00:35:33.852 --> 00:35:35.565
he might last a year or so.

343
00:35:41.435 --> 00:35:43.023
I can smell death...

344
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.716
but whose?

345
00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:46.893
Don't worry.

346
00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:49.331
He can do nothing without me.

347
00:35:50.288 --> 00:35:53.597
So these poor unfortunate
creatures thought...

348
00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:56.854
and where are they?

349
00:35:56.934 --> 00:35:58.023
No, Macro.

350
00:35:59.081 --> 00:36:00.523
He's planning something.

351
00:36:01.047 --> 00:36:02.593
You'll be Emperor, soon.

352
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:17.380
You swear.

353
00:36:17.988 --> 00:36:18.845
I sw...

354
00:36:37.679 --> 00:36:39.100
I swear.

355
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.315
Leave.

356
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:26.815
Everyone leave.

357
00:38:14.175 --> 00:38:15.523
Tiberius.

358
00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:24.065
Tiberius.

359
00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:34.032
Caligula?

360
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:36.190
Lord.

361
00:39:38.134 --> 00:39:40.523
Give me my ring.

362
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.815
No.

363
00:39:51.318 --> 00:39:52.232
Yes.

364
00:40:04.453 --> 00:40:05.950
You...

365
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.647
do not...

366
00:40:07.727 --> 00:40:08.565
dare!

367
00:40:09.518 --> 00:40:10.539
Prince.

368
00:40:10.619 --> 00:40:13.565
You do not dare!

369
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:28.482
Hail, Caesar.

370
00:41:31.715 --> 00:41:33.089
Hail, Caesar.

371
00:41:33.169 --> 00:41:35.179
I'll get everyone assembled in the hall.

372
00:41:36.061 --> 00:41:37.451
For the announcement.

373
00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:28.690
Gemellus?

374
00:42:32.558 --> 00:42:33.773
Gemellus!

375
00:42:41.148 --> 00:42:42.632
Hail, Caesar.

376
00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.721
Gemellus...

377
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.440
we are alone.

378
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.440
We must love each other.

379
00:43:14.172 --> 00:43:18.414
Rest, Tiberius Caesar.

380
00:43:21.593 --> 00:43:26.538
Hail, Caligula Caesar.

381
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.482
It's just like the dream.

382
00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:40.624
It's only his mask.
You are Caesar now.

383
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:43.371
Caesar.

384
00:43:43.451 --> 00:43:48.195
Caesar, Emperor of Rome,
lord of the world.

385
00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:51.337
Lord of the world...

386
00:43:52.864 --> 00:43:54.898
I like this dream.

387
00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.050
At the...

388
00:44:25.816 --> 00:44:30.893
At the insistence of the Senate
and the people of Rome...

389
00:44:32.057 --> 00:44:33.232
I accept...

390
00:44:34.437 --> 00:44:35.376
humbly...

391
00:44:36.944 --> 00:44:40.107
the highest office
of our great republic.

392
00:44:46.547 --> 00:44:47.857
Our great republic!

393
00:45:07.158 --> 00:45:09.480
Where's the onion?
Give me the onion.

394
00:45:36.645 --> 00:45:38.232
When our beloved Tiberius was dying...

395
00:45:38.688 --> 00:45:41.232
- To the Tiber with Tiberius!
- Yes!

396
00:45:43.102 --> 00:45:44.898
- Throw him in the river!
- Yes!

397
00:45:47.532 --> 00:45:50.872
Tiberius! Throw him!
Throw him to the dark!

398
00:45:50.952 --> 00:45:54.357
Today we begin a new era.

399
00:45:55.014 --> 00:45:57.982
I grant a general amnesty.

400
00:45:58.102 --> 00:45:59.815
Hail!

401
00:46:00.768 --> 00:46:02.857
Caesar! Caesar!

402
00:46:08.408 --> 00:46:09.492
Silence!

403
00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:12.815
Silence!

404
00:46:12.935 --> 00:46:15.315
Great Caesar is not finished.

405
00:46:22.462 --> 00:46:23.903
As my fellow consul,

406
00:46:23.983 --> 00:46:26.832
the Senate and the people of Rome...

407
00:46:26.912 --> 00:46:29.940
have wisely chosen
my learned uncle Claudius.

408
00:46:30.213 --> 00:46:31.773
Hail, Claudius!

409
00:46:32.893 --> 00:46:34.773
Take your place
beside me, Claudius.

410
00:46:39.806 --> 00:46:41.879
Caesar Caligula...

411
00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:42.893
Take your place...

412
00:46:42.973 --> 00:46:44.663
I mean consul...

413
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:55.336
I herewith adopt
as my son and heir...

414
00:46:55.881 --> 00:46:57.107
the prince Gemellus.

415
00:46:58.004 --> 00:46:59.940
- Come forward, prince.
- Hail, Gemellus!

416
00:47:14.439 --> 00:47:15.717
From this moment,

417
00:47:15.797 --> 00:47:19.278
all official oaths will contain
the following phrase:

418
00:47:20.293 --> 00:47:24.777
"I will value neither my life,
nor the lives of my children,

419
00:47:25.296 --> 00:47:27.997
any more highly
than I do the Emperor..."

420
00:47:28.077 --> 00:47:31.257
Hail! Hail! Hail!

421
00:47:32.025 --> 00:47:34.565
"...and of his sister, Drusilla."

422
00:47:43.852 --> 00:47:47.023
- Hail, Drusilla!
- Hail, Caligula!

423
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:57.940
We must be careful of him.

424
00:48:02.926 --> 00:48:04.357
Oh, Claudius?

425
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.607
No, Gemellus.

426
00:48:09.997 --> 00:48:12.920
Oh, yes... Gemellus.

427
00:48:18.823 --> 00:48:22.665
Did you see their faces when I told them
they had to swear not only to me,

428
00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:24.215
but to you?

429
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.507
They were appalled.

430
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:30.023
I do hope so.

431
00:48:30.446 --> 00:48:31.690
But is it wise?

432
00:48:39.717 --> 00:48:40.975
I can do...

433
00:48:50.859 --> 00:48:52.675
anything I like...

434
00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:58.769
to anyone.

435
00:49:00.734 --> 00:49:02.586
Well, don't start with me.

436
00:49:05.413 --> 00:49:06.834
Who would you suggest?

437
00:50:08.185 --> 00:50:10.523
Get out! Out!

438
00:50:13.676 --> 00:50:14.690
Who?

439
00:50:15.787 --> 00:50:17.482
Why not start with Macro?

440
00:50:18.497 --> 00:50:20.815
- Macro?
- Yes.

441
00:50:20.935 --> 00:50:24.148
Before he controls you
as he controlled Tiberius.

442
00:50:27.304 --> 00:50:30.398
Superb display, Macro, superb.

443
00:50:37.677 --> 00:50:39.065
Fetch me Gemellus.

444
00:50:39.811 --> 00:50:41.057
What? Here?

445
00:50:43.276 --> 00:50:45.390
Yes, here. Now.

446
00:50:52.394 --> 00:50:54.317
- Charicles.
- My lord?

447
00:50:54.397 --> 00:50:55.369
Stand here.

448
00:51:01.017 --> 00:51:03.184
I want a bonus for my guards.

449
00:51:03.264 --> 00:51:04.856
But, Caesar,
that's not possible.

450
00:51:04.936 --> 00:51:06.984
All things that happen
are possible, Longinus.

451
00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:09.357
Make the impossible happen
and it would be possible. Logical?

452
00:51:09.477 --> 00:51:12.067
How, Caesar?
The deficit, you see, is...

453
00:51:12.147 --> 00:51:14.063
Look, how much is my purse?

454
00:51:14.645 --> 00:51:17.380
Well, lord, that is as much
as you may require.

455
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.940
Oh, good.

456
00:51:19.507 --> 00:51:23.107
Macro, would you stand over there?

457
00:51:27.854 --> 00:51:29.857
Longinus, you here.

458
00:51:30.221 --> 00:51:31.360
Yes, Caesar.

459
00:51:32.953 --> 00:51:38.970
Gemellus, I want you to look
at these gentlemen very carefully.

460
00:51:40.185 --> 00:51:43.823
Take your time and tell me...

461
00:51:44.462 --> 00:51:47.898
who killed our beloved Tiberius?

462
00:51:54.596 --> 00:51:56.648
Who killed Tiberius?

463
00:52:13.981 --> 00:52:14.732
He did!

464
00:52:16.717 --> 00:52:17.482
Macro!

465
00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:28.642
Murderer.

466
00:52:38.587 --> 00:52:40.065
Arrest him.

467
00:52:56.862 --> 00:53:00.357
In honor of your
new commander, Chaerea...

468
00:53:01.735 --> 00:53:03.982
ten gold pieces to every man.

469
00:53:04.102 --> 00:53:07.107
Hail! Hail! Hail!

470
00:53:10.192 --> 00:53:12.565
Chaerea, arrest Macro.

471
00:53:12.685 --> 00:53:14.637
Guards, arrest Macro.

472
00:53:17.435 --> 00:53:18.759
Don't you dare!

473
00:53:49.121 --> 00:53:50.273
Forgive me, Caesar...

474
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:53.647
Chaerea.

475
00:53:53.727 --> 00:53:55.934
Two senators beg to see you.

476
00:53:56.014 --> 00:53:57.607
They have a dispute over land

477
00:53:57.727 --> 00:53:59.523
and await your judgment.

478
00:54:00.233 --> 00:54:01.565
Well, bring them in.

479
00:54:01.645 --> 00:54:02.676
Bring them in.

480
00:54:03.739 --> 00:54:06.767
I'm interested in all that is Rome,

481
00:54:06.847 --> 00:54:09.607
even down to the length of the toga.

482
00:54:10.052 --> 00:54:10.966
Come now.

483
00:54:25.518 --> 00:54:27.482
Caesar, I must complain
about the bov...

484
00:54:27.602 --> 00:54:29.315
Give me the documents.

485
00:54:57.405 --> 00:54:59.857
- Guilty.
- Thank you, thank you.

486
00:55:00.276 --> 00:55:01.273
Don't thank me.

487
00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.220
Justice must always be impartial.

488
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.107
That is so, Chaerea.

489
00:55:08.675 --> 00:55:09.857
Is it not?

490
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:11.232
Yes, Caesar.

491
00:55:12.551 --> 00:55:13.583
You may go.

492
00:55:51.923 --> 00:55:52.893
Ennia.

493
00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:03.685
You look beautiful.

494
00:56:11.758 --> 00:56:13.482
Is it good for growing hair?

495
00:56:15.426 --> 00:56:19.016
We'll be married soon.
The divorce will only take a few days.

496
00:56:22.259 --> 00:56:24.315
- I think we should move.
- Move?

497
00:56:24.822 --> 00:56:25.768
Where?

498
00:56:27.514 --> 00:56:29.123
Alexandria, say.

499
00:56:30.779 --> 00:56:32.187
To Egypt?

500
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.315
Yeah.

501
00:56:36.053 --> 00:56:37.482
What do you think?

502
00:56:37.602 --> 00:56:41.846
I'd hate to leave Rome.
I mean, the Senate...

503
00:56:41.926 --> 00:56:43.732
No, no, Ennia, I am Rome.

504
00:56:44.565 --> 00:56:46.757
Wherever I am, Rome is.

505
00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:49.940
And there is the Senate
and the people of Rome.

506
00:56:52.804 --> 00:56:55.725
You do make me laugh
the way you say that.

507
00:57:05.977 --> 00:57:09.746
- Ah, Longinus.
- Forgive us, Caesar.

508
00:57:14.783 --> 00:57:16.315
Longinus, is it done?

509
00:57:16.768 --> 00:57:18.898
The Senate has
sentenced him to death.

510
00:57:22.999 --> 00:57:24.045
The commission.

511
00:57:29.506 --> 00:57:32.157
Chaerea, I now officially appoint you

512
00:57:32.237 --> 00:57:34.065
commander of my imperial guard.

513
00:57:36.228 --> 00:57:40.166
But what about Macro?
What's happened? Where is he?

514
00:57:40.246 --> 00:57:41.815
He has been arrested for treason.

515
00:57:43.245 --> 00:57:44.315
That's impossible.

516
00:57:45.013 --> 00:57:47.188
Caesar, you know
he worshipped you.

517
00:57:47.268 --> 00:57:48.802
He made you.

518
00:57:56.178 --> 00:58:00.815
- Nobody made me.
- I... I can't believe it.

519
00:58:01.613 --> 00:58:03.315
What did he do?

520
00:58:04.486 --> 00:58:05.553
Ennia...

521
00:58:06.648 --> 00:58:10.217
I had to take my destiny
with my own hands.

522
00:58:22.007 --> 00:58:22.773
Guards.

523
00:58:27.724 --> 00:58:30.009
Chaerea, she's to be banished.

524
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:33.040
- I love you.
- To Gaul.

525
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:34.212
Lift!

526
00:58:34.292 --> 00:58:35.491
I love you.

527
00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:41.235
Caligula, how could you do it?
He was your friend.

528
00:58:41.315 --> 00:58:43.855
He would've done
anything for you.

529
00:58:43.935 --> 00:58:45.190
Don't send me away!

530
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:47.760
I love you!

531
00:58:48.636 --> 00:58:50.176
Caligula!

532
00:58:53.612 --> 00:58:56.357
Now at least she doesn't
have to get a divorce.

533
00:58:56.477 --> 00:58:58.982
But you still have to find
a suitable wife.

534
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.744
No.

535
00:59:06.639 --> 00:59:08.410
I'm going to marry you.

536
00:59:09.061 --> 00:59:11.634
You can't, we're not Egyptians.

537
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.440
I know.

538
00:59:15.102 --> 00:59:17.374
We are much more beautiful.

539
00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:19.148
Rome is not Egypt.

540
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.468
And stop looking
at yourself like that.

541
00:59:25.438 --> 00:59:28.729
- Let's go to Egypt then.
- You are a fool.

542
00:59:29.352 --> 00:59:32.982
- Caesar cannot be a fool.
- But he's trying very hard.

543
00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:35.773
Caesar cannot be a fool!

544
00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.563
Little Boots, they'll
throw you in the Tiber

545
00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:42.023
if you attempt to move
the government.

546
00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.607
So, you are going to marry

547
00:59:44.727 --> 00:59:48.451
a respectable Roman lady
of the senatorial class.

548
00:59:51.206 --> 00:59:53.232
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

549
00:59:53.352 --> 00:59:54.982
You've got to have an heir.

550
00:59:58.716 --> 01:00:01.648
Who will kill me
when he grows up.

551
01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:06.776
The priestesses of Isis are meeting
at my house tonight.

552
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:10.898
You want me
to marry one of them?

553
01:00:11.018 --> 01:00:11.814
Yes.

554
01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.149
No.

555
01:00:13.229 --> 01:00:13.940
Yes.

556
01:00:15.598 --> 01:00:16.148
No.

557
01:00:18.768 --> 01:00:19.570
Yes.

558
01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.648
I wonder what I should wear.

559
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:08.060
When is the performance
for almighty Caesar?

560
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.938
Don't be disgusting.

561
01:01:10.018 --> 01:01:11.565
But I'm being practical.

562
01:01:11.645 --> 01:01:14.231
If I'm to chose a wife,
I want to see what I'm getting.

563
01:01:15.477 --> 01:01:16.482
Logic.

564
01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:47.107
Now that one looks
rather interesting.

565
01:01:47.227 --> 01:01:49.461
Livia? She's taken.

566
01:01:49.541 --> 01:01:52.023
She's to marry Proculus,
one of your officers.

567
01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:53.474
I'll send him to Spain.

568
01:01:53.554 --> 01:01:57.549
She's a virgin, very boring,
not your style.

569
01:03:05.352 --> 01:03:07.607
That will be my wife.

570
01:03:07.727 --> 01:03:09.748
Oh, no, not Caesonia.

571
01:03:11.743 --> 01:03:12.523
You're impossible.

572
01:03:13.009 --> 01:03:15.398
She's the most promiscuous
woman in Rome.

573
01:03:16.447 --> 01:03:17.648
Perfect.

574
01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:30.521
Caesonia's been divorced.
She's extravagant, always in debt.

575
01:03:31.216 --> 01:03:32.812
I want her.

576
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.773
But not for a wife.

577
01:03:35.518 --> 01:03:37.482
Send her to me now.

578
01:03:37.602 --> 01:03:40.214
No, Little Boots,
I won't let you do it.

579
01:03:40.701 --> 01:03:41.815
It wouldn't be wise.

580
01:03:46.119 --> 01:03:47.172
Yes.

581
01:03:48.393 --> 01:03:51.479
Such as the will of the Senate
and the people of Rome.

582
01:06:00.702 --> 01:06:04.458
You're very convincing
as a priestess, Caesar.

583
01:06:06.469 --> 01:06:07.648
And you...

584
01:06:08.292 --> 01:06:11.523
as a sacrificial lamb, Caesonia.

585
01:07:23.584 --> 01:07:26.413
I told Caesonia
that I would marry her.

586
01:07:27.485 --> 01:07:28.169
Don't...

587
01:07:28.249 --> 01:07:30.335
But only after she's born me a son.

588
01:07:30.415 --> 01:07:32.185
How will you ever know it's yours?

589
01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:35.790
Don't worry.
I've got her very well guarded.

590
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:39.148
Can you be sure one of the guards
will be the father?

591
01:07:40.102 --> 01:07:43.147
They're all homosexuals
who've been castrated.

592
01:08:22.927 --> 01:08:26.896
If only all Rome had just one neck!

593
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.648
Is that the officer
that Livia's going to marry?

594
01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.720
Yes, Proculus.

595
01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:53.917
Proculus.

596
01:08:56.951 --> 01:08:58.538
- Longinus...
- Caesar?

597
01:08:58.618 --> 01:09:01.882
You see this young officer
over here? Proculus?

598
01:09:51.234 --> 01:09:55.129
Caligula Caesar, Emperor of Rome.

599
01:09:55.209 --> 01:09:57.773
- Hail.
- Hail!

600
01:10:00.326 --> 01:10:03.103
And the lady Drusilla
and the lady Caesonia.

601
01:10:03.234 --> 01:10:06.490
And the lady Drusilla
and the lady Caesonia.

602
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:08.660
- Hail.
- Hail!

603
01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.359
- Are we late?
- No, Caesar.

604
01:10:15.439 --> 01:10:17.357
Do forgive us.

605
01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.773
Was the ceremony beautiful?

606
01:10:20.099 --> 01:10:21.342
The augury is good?

607
01:10:21.422 --> 01:10:22.697
Yes, Caesar.

608
01:10:23.542 --> 01:10:24.932
Splendid.

609
01:10:27.237 --> 01:10:28.376
Come on, come on.

610
01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:38.523
You are very gracious to come.

611
01:10:44.477 --> 01:10:46.672
You are a Roman hero.

612
01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:48.198
Caesar.

613
01:10:59.783 --> 01:11:01.675
I shall now bestow...

614
01:11:01.755 --> 01:11:04.482
the special blessings
of almighty Caesar...

615
01:11:04.602 --> 01:11:06.288
upon this...

616
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.815
happy union.

617
01:11:13.457 --> 01:11:15.648
Which way is the sacred
marriage bed?

618
01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:41.464
Ah, the kitchen.
Well, this will have to do.

619
01:11:44.999 --> 01:11:45.700
See you later.

620
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:47.773
Little Boots.

621
01:11:48.172 --> 01:11:50.190
I thought you didn't like virgins.

622
01:11:51.103 --> 01:11:52.443
I've never known any.

623
01:11:56.505 --> 01:11:58.440
That is correct, Caesonia?

624
01:12:03.708 --> 01:12:06.606
And now for Caesar's wedding gift.

625
01:12:15.741 --> 01:12:18.051
What a delicious bride.

626
01:12:22.228 --> 01:12:23.732
Take off that robe.

627
01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.190
Splendid.

628
01:12:50.143 --> 01:12:52.232
Is she really a virgin, Proculus?

629
01:12:52.879 --> 01:12:54.523
Yes, Caesar.

630
01:12:55.985 --> 01:12:58.282
One can never be quite sure.

631
01:13:00.814 --> 01:13:03.565
Open your eyes, Livia.

632
01:13:22.674 --> 01:13:24.148
Lucky girl.

633
01:13:24.464 --> 01:13:26.736
To lose ones virginity...

634
01:13:27.444 --> 01:13:30.773
to a direct descendant
of the goddess Venus.

635
01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.329
I...

636
01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:35.405
Caligula Caesar...

637
01:13:36.049 --> 01:13:37.351
command...

638
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:40.565
Open your eyes, Proculus.

639
01:13:41.613 --> 01:13:43.611
...command in the
name of the Senate...

640
01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:44.849
Open them!

641
01:13:48.602 --> 01:13:49.946
...the Senate...

642
01:13:51.102 --> 01:13:54.148
and the people of...

643
01:13:54.228 --> 01:13:55.782
Rome!

644
01:14:21.352 --> 01:14:23.043
She really was a virgin.

645
01:14:26.182 --> 01:14:27.221
Are you?

646
01:14:33.473 --> 01:14:35.070
Well? Are you?

647
01:14:36.703 --> 01:14:38.351
- No, Caesar.
- No?

648
01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:40.681
Well, Isis won't like that.

649
01:14:40.761 --> 01:14:43.481
One law for woman, one for man.
That's not fair.

650
01:14:43.561 --> 01:14:45.059
Come on, off with your clothes.

651
01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.639
Splendid.

652
01:15:01.506 --> 01:15:04.815
I like your nice,
bushy hair, Proculus.

653
01:15:05.503 --> 01:15:07.745
No, Caesar, I beg you.

654
01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:09.572
So sit up!

655
01:15:20.935 --> 01:15:22.731
I think you were lying to me.

656
01:15:24.472 --> 01:15:26.375
You're a virgin, too.

657
01:15:45.085 --> 01:15:45.918
I...

658
01:15:46.738 --> 01:15:48.486
Caligula Caesar...

659
01:15:49.156 --> 01:15:52.505
command...
in the name of the Senate...

660
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:55.087
Open your eyes, Livia.

661
01:15:55.807 --> 01:15:57.107
...and the people of...

662
01:15:57.756 --> 01:15:58.644
Rome!

663
01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:15.748
You see how I've exhausted myself
in order to make your wedding holy.

664
01:16:24.563 --> 01:16:26.259
My blessings to you both.

665
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.448
Gemellus!

666
01:17:13.935 --> 01:17:14.982
Caligula!

667
01:17:16.516 --> 01:17:17.607
Caligula!

668
01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.315
Gemellus!

669
01:17:53.558 --> 01:17:55.743
Jupiter loves me!

670
01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.212
Drusilla!

671
01:18:12.279 --> 01:18:14.607
- He's trying to kill me.
- Who, Little Boots?

672
01:18:15.809 --> 01:18:16.863
Gemellus.

673
01:18:17.582 --> 01:18:20.825
I saw him. He ran away.
He wants me dead.

674
01:18:31.443 --> 01:18:34.617
Now... there, Little Boots.

675
01:18:38.777 --> 01:18:40.304
Now you'll be alright.

676
01:18:46.631 --> 01:18:47.507
There...

677
01:23:48.574 --> 01:23:50.023
Hail, Caesar!

678
01:23:50.143 --> 01:23:51.884
Hail, Caesar!

679
01:23:51.964 --> 01:23:55.580
All hail Caesar's
beautiful horse, Incitatus.

680
01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:58.565
Hail the most honorable Incitatus.

681
01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.992
Hail, Incitatus!

682
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:06.898
There's Gemellus over there.
Watch him.

683
01:24:23.568 --> 01:24:25.903
Chuck, chuck, dear uncle,
chuck, chuck.

684
01:24:27.088 --> 01:24:28.732
I want your honest advice.

685
01:24:30.025 --> 01:24:32.232
Should I make myself king of Rome?

686
01:24:32.692 --> 01:24:33.482
King?

687
01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:37.415
But this is a republic, isn't it?

688
01:24:38.102 --> 01:24:39.398
Very well, then.

689
01:24:41.504 --> 01:24:43.523
I shall make myself
king of the republic.

690
01:24:43.805 --> 01:24:45.940
But you're already greater
than any king, Caesar.

691
01:24:47.727 --> 01:24:49.273
I am a god.

692
01:24:50.227 --> 01:24:52.065
Or at least I will be when I'm dead.

693
01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:10.773
Gemellus, try one of these morels.

694
01:25:18.537 --> 01:25:21.399
- What's that smell?
- What smell, Caesar?

695
01:25:21.479 --> 01:25:22.653
What have you been taking?

696
01:25:22.733 --> 01:25:25.357
Just a medicine.
To ward off the fever.

697
01:25:26.069 --> 01:25:28.232
Did you give him
medicine for the fever?

698
01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:30.982
- Yes or no?
- No, no.

699
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.999
Gemellus, are you accusing
your sovereign of being a poisoner?

700
01:25:37.079 --> 01:25:38.896
But I never accused you, Caesar.

701
01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:42.806
You took an antidote
before coming to my table.

702
01:25:42.886 --> 01:25:46.201
Which is tantamount
to accusing me of poisoning you.

703
01:25:46.281 --> 01:25:48.148
That is logic, is it not?

704
01:25:48.719 --> 01:25:49.937
Caligula!

705
01:26:05.244 --> 01:26:06.352
Chaerea...

706
01:26:08.543 --> 01:26:09.982
arrest Gemellus...

707
01:26:11.010 --> 01:26:11.607
for treason.

708
01:26:12.682 --> 01:26:14.505
Guards, take him away.

709
01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:22.732
No! No, please!

710
01:26:22.852 --> 01:26:24.081
No!

711
01:26:37.762 --> 01:26:40.804
As if there ever could be
an antidote against Caesar.

712
01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.578
Drusilla...

713
01:26:52.655 --> 01:26:54.484
why are you so concerned for him?

714
01:26:54.564 --> 01:26:56.543
I'm not concerned for him,

715
01:26:56.623 --> 01:26:58.648
- but for you.
- He knows about Tiberius.

716
01:26:59.135 --> 01:27:01.148
- He's a threat to me.
- He's not.

717
01:27:01.423 --> 01:27:03.101
He's not even your heir.

718
01:27:03.716 --> 01:27:05.607
Caesonia now carries your child.

719
01:27:09.872 --> 01:27:11.607
Gemellus will die.

720
01:27:12.246 --> 01:27:13.440
You amateur!

721
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:15.565
Amateur?

722
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:12.463
And they weren't even poisoned.

723
01:28:26.787 --> 01:28:27.808
Caesar?

724
01:28:36.665 --> 01:28:37.656
Well done.

725
01:28:38.437 --> 01:28:39.194
Thank you.

726
01:28:39.732 --> 01:28:42.332
What will you do to her?
What she said was treason.

727
01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:46.751
I decide what is treason, not you.

728
01:28:49.116 --> 01:28:50.136
Dance!

729
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.607
- Dance?
- Yes.

730
01:28:55.171 --> 01:28:56.607
And what about your son?

731
01:28:57.136 --> 01:29:00.374
Show Incitatus your new dance.

732
01:29:00.975 --> 01:29:01.939
My son...

733
01:29:03.493 --> 01:29:04.940
he will dance with you.

734
01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.236
Music!

735
01:31:06.826 --> 01:31:08.982
You are... beautiful...

736
01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:12.944
Drusilla...

737
01:31:14.164 --> 01:31:15.266
beautiful...

738
01:31:16.665 --> 01:31:18.607
We are alone...

739
01:31:18.727 --> 01:31:19.269
Alone..

740
01:31:19.349 --> 01:31:20.321
Drusil...

741
01:31:58.967 --> 01:32:01.006
- He's going to kill me.
- No.

742
01:32:01.088 --> 01:32:02.510
He can't kill me.

743
01:32:05.346 --> 01:32:08.761
- The fever must break soon.
- He's going to kill me.

744
01:32:08.841 --> 01:32:10.907
- What if it doesn't?
- He's going to kill me.

745
01:32:11.954 --> 01:32:13.361
He's going to kill me.

746
01:32:15.269 --> 01:32:16.245
Drusilla...

747
01:32:17.081 --> 01:32:18.065
Drusilla...

748
01:32:18.892 --> 01:32:20.232
He's going to kill me.

749
01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:22.599
He's going to kill...

750
01:32:22.993 --> 01:32:23.752
me.

751
01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:29.359
Drusilla...

752
01:32:32.169 --> 01:32:33.509
I love you.

753
01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:48.065
Where's my sister?

754
01:32:48.464 --> 01:32:49.815
She's coming.

755
01:33:04.643 --> 01:33:06.170
I'm here, Little Boots.

756
01:33:10.397 --> 01:33:11.831
Drusilla...

757
01:33:12.995 --> 01:33:16.183
- I'm dying.
- You are not.

758
01:33:17.756 --> 01:33:18.776
I must...

759
01:33:19.791 --> 01:33:21.502
make my will.

760
01:33:21.582 --> 01:33:23.750
Don't talk, sleep.

761
01:33:24.282 --> 01:33:25.440
Longinus...

762
01:33:25.796 --> 01:33:27.857
I want Longinus.

763
01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:35.011
Take my horse to his own bed.

764
01:33:38.366 --> 01:33:39.615
He's a monster.

765
01:33:39.695 --> 01:33:42.490
Even so, it's better that
he doesn't die this time.

766
01:33:42.570 --> 01:33:44.651
- I don't see why.
- The people love him.

767
01:33:44.731 --> 01:33:48.206
There could be war, revolutions,
civil chaos if he dies.

768
01:33:48.286 --> 01:33:50.817
It looks as if he's going
to die anyway.

769
01:33:54.263 --> 01:33:55.190
Longinus?

770
01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.732
You called for me, Caesar?

771
01:34:16.264 --> 01:34:17.273
My will.

772
01:34:24.527 --> 01:34:27.382
Herewith to my beloved Drusilla...

773
01:34:30.727 --> 01:34:32.746
the Roman Empire...

774
01:34:34.959 --> 01:34:36.190
title...

775
01:34:37.023 --> 01:34:38.770
of Augusta...

776
01:34:46.765 --> 01:34:48.565
my little boots.

777
01:34:55.465 --> 01:34:56.272
Little boo...

778
01:35:02.366 --> 01:35:03.593
He's sleeping.

779
01:35:06.185 --> 01:35:07.839
No, he's not.

780
01:35:31.236 --> 01:35:32.200
Drusilla...

781
01:35:33.968 --> 01:35:35.972
why do I get angry with you?

782
01:35:37.361 --> 01:35:39.065
Why do we always argue?

783
01:35:39.785 --> 01:35:41.331
You can't help it.

784
01:35:42.322 --> 01:35:44.026
We'll never quarrel again.

785
01:35:44.106 --> 01:35:45.732
Oh, yes, we will.

786
01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:51.732
Don't let me die.

787
01:36:04.327 --> 01:36:07.357
My lady, you must not touch him.

788
01:36:07.437 --> 01:36:09.294
The fever is contagious.

789
01:36:10.385 --> 01:36:13.193
Sleep, you're safe now.

790
01:36:13.273 --> 01:36:14.568
Drusilla's here.

791
01:36:15.027 --> 01:36:16.982
I offer my life,

792
01:36:17.413 --> 01:36:24.400
if Jupiter will only spare
our beloved Emperor.

793
01:36:29.495 --> 01:36:31.815
Jupiter accepts your offer.

794
01:36:32.819 --> 01:36:33.933
Execute him.

795
01:36:43.627 --> 01:36:45.559
The fever is breaking.

796
01:36:46.585 --> 01:36:49.928
Do you hear that, Little Boots?
You're going to live.

797
01:36:55.362 --> 01:36:57.930
Drusilla tells me that
I've been neglecting my work,

798
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:59.639
so I report for duty.

799
01:36:59.719 --> 01:37:03.055
Your signature
and seal is required, lord.

800
01:37:08.327 --> 01:37:10.167
I, Caligula Caesar,

801
01:37:10.247 --> 01:37:13.315
command in the name of the Senate
and the people of Rome.

802
01:37:22.285 --> 01:37:25.615
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name of the...

803
01:37:27.263 --> 01:37:28.820
Senate... and...

804
01:37:31.302 --> 01:37:32.923
the people of Rome.

805
01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.565
I, Caligula Caesar,

806
01:37:38.685 --> 01:37:41.117
command in the name of the Senate
and the people of Rome.

807
01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:42.408
I, Caligula Caesar, command

808
01:37:42.488 --> 01:37:44.231
in the name of the Senate
and the people of Rome.

809
01:37:50.729 --> 01:37:52.316
Rome, Rome, Caesar, Caesar,

810
01:37:52.396 --> 01:37:53.440
Rome, Rome, rubbish,
rubbish, rubbish!

811
01:38:02.174 --> 01:38:03.715
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name

812
01:38:03.795 --> 01:38:05.767
of the Senate
and the people of Rome.

813
01:38:11.618 --> 01:38:13.643
No wonder life's so dull.

814
01:38:13.723 --> 01:38:15.614
Yes, lord...
No, lord... but...

815
01:38:16.552 --> 01:38:19.532
Let's see if Proculus
can liven things up for us.

816
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.768
Proculus.

817
01:38:43.002 --> 01:38:46.155
Do you know that his wife
is expecting her first child?

818
01:38:46.235 --> 01:38:48.482
We're not quite sure
who the father is.

819
01:38:48.861 --> 01:38:50.855
Him or...

820
01:38:50.935 --> 01:38:51.744
god.

821
01:38:54.692 --> 01:38:56.565
Divine Caesar, please.

822
01:38:57.415 --> 01:38:59.773
What have I done? Why am I here?

823
01:39:00.643 --> 01:39:01.357
Treason.

824
01:39:02.093 --> 01:39:04.606
I've always been loyal to you.

825
01:39:04.686 --> 01:39:06.898
That is your treason.

826
01:39:07.456 --> 01:39:11.068
You're an honest man, Proculus,
which means a bad Roman.

827
01:39:11.148 --> 01:39:13.048
Therefore you're a traitor.

828
01:39:13.576 --> 01:39:14.819
Logical, hmm?

829
01:39:28.206 --> 01:39:30.866
Now you must die like Gemellus.

830
01:39:31.943 --> 01:39:34.357
Like all those who failed Rome.

831
01:39:53.445 --> 01:39:57.148
Now slowly, very slowly.

832
01:39:58.515 --> 01:40:00.800
I want him to feel death.

833
01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.857
I want him to smell death.

834
01:40:16.463 --> 01:40:18.410
What does it feel like, Proculus?

835
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:21.950
Can you see the great goddess Isis?

836
01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:23.380
What does she say?

837
01:40:29.369 --> 01:40:30.646
Reptile.

838
01:40:31.872 --> 01:40:33.626
Make a note of this.

839
01:40:51.495 --> 01:40:54.267
I said slowly, you fool!

840
01:41:13.295 --> 01:41:15.168
Lucky boy.

841
01:41:15.248 --> 01:41:17.996
To've escaped me so easily.

842
01:41:36.573 --> 01:41:37.690
Longinus...

843
01:41:38.221 --> 01:41:39.471
reptile...

844
01:41:40.204 --> 01:41:42.529
cut off those
and send them to Livia,

845
01:41:42.609 --> 01:41:46.148
as a souvenir of their great love.

846
01:42:04.317 --> 01:42:06.971
Caesar says, "Cut them off."

847
01:42:34.752 --> 01:42:37.262
And now send the rest to Livia.

848
01:43:08.303 --> 01:43:09.454
Curtain!

849
01:43:27.852 --> 01:43:29.037
Child's head

850
01:43:29.137 --> 01:43:31.107
has just appeared.

851
01:43:37.306 --> 01:43:39.694
- Is he alive?
- Yes, Caesar.

852
01:43:44.496 --> 01:43:46.065
My lords...

853
01:43:46.562 --> 01:43:48.523
I'm now to be married to Caesonia,

854
01:43:49.097 --> 01:43:53.343
the mother of my son,
Caligula Germanicus.

855
01:44:01.547 --> 01:44:04.058
Caligula, Caesonia...

856
01:44:04.138 --> 01:44:06.129
Ring, ring! Give me the ring!

857
01:44:23.368 --> 01:44:25.190
You are now wife,

858
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:26.837
mother...

859
01:44:26.917 --> 01:44:28.648
and empress of Rome.

860
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:31.915
It's a girl.

861
01:44:35.103 --> 01:44:36.398
It's a girl.

862
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:40.834
It is not a girl.
Did you not hear Caesar say?

863
01:44:40.914 --> 01:44:42.898
I heard the voice of Caesar,

864
01:44:43.018 --> 01:44:44.565
but your daughter did not.

865
01:44:54.547 --> 01:44:55.898
I should've waited, shouldn't I?

866
01:44:56.331 --> 01:44:58.240
There will be other children.

867
01:45:08.706 --> 01:45:10.648
- Longinus.
- Caesar?

868
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:17.122
One month of free games
and a gold coin to every Roman

869
01:45:17.202 --> 01:45:20.517
to celebrate the birth of my son.

870
01:45:23.110 --> 01:45:24.997
My son...

871
01:45:25.714 --> 01:45:28.378
Julia Drusilla!

872
01:45:28.458 --> 01:45:31.396
Julia Drusilla!

873
01:45:31.476 --> 01:45:32.315
Drusilla?

874
01:45:39.564 --> 01:45:40.490
Drusilla.

875
01:45:41.893 --> 01:45:43.908
- The fever.
- Drusilla.

876
01:45:45.038 --> 01:45:46.154
The fever!

877
01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:17.811
Drusilla.

878
01:46:21.635 --> 01:46:22.695
I'm here...

879
01:46:23.252 --> 01:46:24.379
it's your Little Boots.

880
01:46:28.538 --> 01:46:29.815
It's your Little Boots.

881
01:46:37.777 --> 01:46:38.773
Do something.

882
01:46:39.419 --> 01:46:42.107
I am doing everything
I... I can, Caesar.

883
01:46:42.637 --> 01:46:46.821
I swear. But the fever
must take its course.

884
01:47:05.518 --> 01:47:08.148
Great Isis, save her.

885
01:47:09.499 --> 01:47:10.963
Take me.

886
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:16.364
Caesar begs you, o mighty goddess.

887
01:47:21.342 --> 01:47:22.023
Caesar...

888
01:47:56.801 --> 01:47:57.640
Drusilla?

889
01:49:11.787 --> 01:49:13.633
Get out! Get out!

890
01:49:33.101 --> 01:49:34.096
Drusilla.

891
01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:43.523
Almighty mother...

892
01:49:48.205 --> 01:49:49.188
You...

893
01:49:59.838 --> 01:50:01.177
I begged you...

894
01:50:03.913 --> 01:50:05.982
Caesar begged you...

895
01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.982
No!

896
01:53:52.228 --> 01:53:55.447
We, Gaius Caesar Caligula,

897
01:53:55.527 --> 01:53:58.128
do decree one month
of public mourning

898
01:53:58.208 --> 01:54:01.164
for our beloved sister, Drusilla.

899
01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:04.232
During which time
anyone who laughs,

900
01:54:04.352 --> 01:54:07.203
baths, dines with
his parents or children,

901
01:54:07.283 --> 01:54:10.648
or has intercourse
will be sentenced to death.

902
01:54:11.123 --> 01:54:14.464
Such as the will of the Senate
and the people of Rome.

903
01:54:32.511 --> 01:54:33.537
Hello.

904
01:54:58.997 --> 01:55:00.055
Come on, darling.

905
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:18.586
Caligula has let go.

906
01:55:19.518 --> 01:55:25.375
Nestor restores the imperial heirs.

907
01:55:28.487 --> 01:55:31.725
The slaves of Rome.

908
01:55:43.174 --> 01:55:45.340
The people.

909
01:55:53.982 --> 01:55:57.306
The army.

910
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:06.486
The tribunes of the people.

911
01:56:16.810 --> 01:56:19.614
The Senate.

912
01:56:44.671 --> 01:56:47.190
And great and supreme...

913
01:56:47.814 --> 01:56:50.523
the Emperor.

914
01:56:59.059 --> 01:56:59.472
Hail.

915
01:57:00.692 --> 01:57:02.789
And I am...

916
01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:06.607
the lady Drusilla,

917
01:57:07.343 --> 01:57:10.022
his sister.

918
01:57:10.102 --> 01:57:18.648
Let's make love once again,
brother nestor.

919
01:57:20.038 --> 01:57:21.982
No! No!

920
01:57:22.819 --> 01:57:23.797
Stop!

921
01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:25.940
Stop!

922
01:58:22.378 --> 01:58:24.977
Another drunk. Come on.

923
01:59:04.269 --> 01:59:06.190
Do you have any news of him?

924
01:59:15.926 --> 01:59:20.963
According to one report,
he's gone to Egypt.

925
01:59:22.626 --> 01:59:25.009
And according to the other reports?

926
01:59:26.004 --> 01:59:26.849
Well...

927
01:59:27.895 --> 01:59:29.084
to Greece...

928
01:59:29.823 --> 01:59:31.662
another, to Persia...

929
01:59:33.111 --> 01:59:34.679
to Carthage...

930
01:59:34.759 --> 01:59:37.023
and another again, to Gaul.

931
01:59:39.048 --> 01:59:42.065
And where do you think he is?

932
01:59:43.352 --> 01:59:46.190
- He could be anywhere.
- No.

933
01:59:46.701 --> 01:59:48.469
He's here in Rome.

934
01:59:49.507 --> 01:59:50.690
He's testing us.

935
02:02:50.469 --> 02:02:51.366
Get off!

936
02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:57.492
I have existed from
the morning of the world,

937
02:02:57.572 --> 02:03:01.178
and I shall exist until
the last star falls from the night.

938
02:03:01.258 --> 02:03:04.213
Although I have taken
the form of Gaius Caligula,

939
02:03:04.293 --> 02:03:06.185
I am all men as I am no man.

940
02:03:06.265 --> 02:03:08.355
And therefore I am...

941
02:03:10.241 --> 02:03:11.273
a god.

942
02:03:24.291 --> 02:03:28.748
I shall wait for the unanimous
decision of the Senate, Claudius.

943
02:03:29.295 --> 02:03:31.640
All those who say aye,

944
02:03:32.202 --> 02:03:33.482
say "aye."

945
02:03:38.614 --> 02:03:39.678
Aye.

946
02:03:42.083 --> 02:03:42.690
Aye!

947
02:03:43.327 --> 02:03:44.730
- Aye.
- Aye.

948
02:03:53.354 --> 02:03:54.815
He's a god now.

949
02:04:22.608 --> 02:04:27.367
The period of mourning
is now over!

950
02:04:27.447 --> 02:04:28.398
He's mad!

951
02:04:53.467 --> 02:04:54.832
Enjoy yourself.

952
02:04:56.246 --> 02:04:57.548
Take care.

953
02:05:13.753 --> 02:05:16.187
Now the fun begins.

954
02:05:16.851 --> 02:05:19.357
But... are you going to
enjoy it as well?

955
02:05:19.477 --> 02:05:21.574
I don't know.
Should we ask them?

956
02:05:22.332 --> 02:05:23.423
Longinus.

957
02:05:29.241 --> 02:05:32.690
Longinus, my financial wizard.

958
02:05:33.710 --> 02:05:35.572
We have a question for you.

959
02:05:36.736 --> 02:05:38.148
Who're the richest men in Rome?

960
02:05:39.353 --> 02:05:40.362
Who?

961
02:05:41.484 --> 02:05:42.655
Answer:

962
02:05:43.690 --> 02:05:45.148
the pimps.

963
02:05:45.749 --> 02:05:47.239
Question number two.

964
02:05:48.311 --> 02:05:53.017
Who are the most lascivious sluts
in all of Rome?

965
02:05:55.084 --> 02:05:55.607
Who?

966
02:05:57.768 --> 02:05:58.976
Answer:

967
02:05:59.732 --> 02:06:01.773
the senators' wives.

968
02:06:02.314 --> 02:06:05.622
So, an imperial brothel.

969
02:06:05.702 --> 02:06:08.788
A most logical way
to balance the state budget.

970
02:06:47.573 --> 02:06:49.703
As you can see,
ladies and gentlemen,

971
02:06:49.783 --> 02:06:51.458
we have gone to great expense

972
02:06:51.538 --> 02:06:54.849
to bring you the finest flesh
in our empire.

973
02:07:04.439 --> 02:07:06.148
Five gold pieces.

974
02:07:08.696 --> 02:07:13.398
Only five gold pieces for each
and every twenty minutes.

975
02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:15.986
And that's a bargain.

976
02:07:28.701 --> 02:07:32.319
Look at them.
Aren't they beautiful?

977
02:07:43.168 --> 02:07:46.219
The most lascivious ladies
of the Roman Empire

978
02:07:46.299 --> 02:07:51.053
have come today to perform
their patriotic duties for all.

979
02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:53.898
For a mere five gold pieces.

980
02:07:54.216 --> 02:07:57.190
So give, that they will
remember you well.

981
02:07:59.768 --> 02:08:02.697
Come on aboard
the imperial bordello

982
02:08:02.797 --> 02:08:06.710
and you have your choice
of the finest flesh in the Empire.

983
02:08:10.564 --> 02:08:14.672
Just five gold pieces for each
and every twenty minutes.

984
02:08:14.752 --> 02:08:17.107
And that's a bargain because
most of the women here

985
02:08:17.187 --> 02:08:19.398
are respectable, married ladies.

986
02:08:20.068 --> 02:08:24.440
Senators' wives.
Whores of blameless reputation.

987
02:08:27.268 --> 02:08:29.494
I'll have to work out
a special rate for you.

988
02:08:35.868 --> 02:08:38.190
Greetings! Flavia, come!

989
02:08:38.701 --> 02:08:40.012
Don't waste time.

990
02:08:40.092 --> 02:08:45.283
Our senators' wives are not merely
beautiful like their husbands,

991
02:08:45.363 --> 02:08:47.023
they are insatiable.

992
02:08:48.227 --> 02:08:52.193
And for only five gold pieces,
to anyone of you.

993
02:09:25.227 --> 02:09:27.759
To the likes of those
who summon you.

994
02:09:27.839 --> 02:09:30.398
Take their wives, use them,

995
02:09:30.745 --> 02:09:32.410
abuse them.

996
02:09:32.490 --> 02:09:34.273
Do as you will with them.

997
02:09:34.393 --> 02:09:38.820
They are yours.
Just yours for only five.

998
02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:41.065
Five gold pieces.

999
02:09:44.668 --> 02:09:46.023
Hairy nipples.

1000
02:09:49.524 --> 02:09:51.089
Senator Marcellus...

1001
02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:55.029
your wife will scare
our customers away.

1002
02:09:56.194 --> 02:09:57.482
Try hot walnuts.

1003
02:09:59.136 --> 02:10:02.442
Hey, you over there.
Don't stint yourselves.

1004
02:10:02.522 --> 02:10:06.648
The more that you give,
the more they will like it.

1005
02:10:39.537 --> 02:10:43.837
Come and enjoy the skills
perfected by our senators' ladies,

1006
02:10:43.937 --> 02:10:47.377
while their husbands
slept in the Senate.

1007
02:11:21.637 --> 02:11:24.175
Only five gold pieces.

1008
02:11:24.668 --> 02:11:25.690
Five.

1009
02:11:26.827 --> 02:11:28.456
Senators' wives...

1010
02:11:28.556 --> 02:11:31.619
all a blameless reputation.

1011
02:11:53.283 --> 02:11:56.069
He's making prostitutes
of all our wives and daughters.

1012
02:11:56.783 --> 02:11:59.225
Humiliated the Senate
and offended the army.

1013
02:11:59.305 --> 02:12:00.934
That's why the people love him.

1014
02:12:14.735 --> 02:12:17.232
Longinus, you're not having any fun.

1015
02:12:17.665 --> 02:12:19.982
Enjoy yourself.
What is your preference?

1016
02:12:20.605 --> 02:12:22.898
Everything and nothing, Caesar.

1017
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:27.273
You can't have both
for the same price.

1018
02:12:36.137 --> 02:12:38.672
- He's provoking you.
- Only me?

1019
02:12:39.529 --> 02:12:42.047
He's mad, he doesn't know
what he's doing.

1020
02:12:43.443 --> 02:12:45.773
He knows what he's doing
perfectly well.

1021
02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:51.398
- Give him enough rope, perhaps...
- He'll hang us all.

1022
02:13:32.737 --> 02:13:36.662
We also have a few
very severe ladies here today.

1023
02:13:37.112 --> 02:13:40.857
You may punish them
or be punished by them.

1024
02:13:41.249 --> 02:13:43.977
Five gold pieces will buy you both.

1025
02:13:44.585 --> 02:13:47.075
Just five gold pieces.

1026
02:14:22.179 --> 02:14:25.535
Can't you stop plotting
for just a few moments?

1027
02:14:27.333 --> 02:14:28.542
Chaerea,

1028
02:14:28.622 --> 02:14:30.898
I hear you have a taste
for little boys.

1029
02:14:31.546 --> 02:14:34.351
- Is that not so?
- No, Caesar, big boys.

1030
02:14:35.847 --> 02:14:37.023
My soldiers.

1031
02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.523
- Are they ready?
- Yes, Caesar.

1032
02:14:40.398 --> 02:14:41.700
Perfect.

1033
02:14:53.227 --> 02:14:55.607
We sail for Britain!

1034
02:15:48.208 --> 02:15:50.029
He will not go again.

1035
02:17:17.341 --> 02:17:21.023
We're only a few hours
march from Rome.

1036
02:17:21.842 --> 02:17:24.162
And what new madness is this?

1037
02:17:27.742 --> 02:17:30.982
Mars tells me we will
enjoy a great victory.

1038
02:17:36.623 --> 02:17:38.851
- Ah, Chaerea.
- Caesar?

1039
02:17:40.908 --> 02:17:42.815
Are we prepared for the invasion?

1040
02:17:43.512 --> 02:17:45.121
Yes, Caesar...

1041
02:17:46.267 --> 02:17:46.940
only...

1042
02:17:47.964 --> 02:17:49.119
Only what?

1043
02:17:50.822 --> 02:17:53.814
- Where is Britain?
- Where?

1044
02:17:55.308 --> 02:17:56.513
There.

1045
02:17:57.518 --> 02:17:59.148
Yes, lord, there...

1046
02:18:00.333 --> 02:18:03.315
but... there is no enemy.

1047
02:18:05.142 --> 02:18:07.148
There is papyrus cane.

1048
02:18:08.393 --> 02:18:11.710
- Papyrus cane, divine Caesar?
- Yes, papyrus.

1049
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:13.940
Don't be so stupid, Chaerea.

1050
02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:17.796
Order my army to attack
and destroy that papyrus.

1051
02:18:18.366 --> 02:18:19.690
Yes, lord.

1052
02:18:24.310 --> 02:18:28.216
After all, we must have some proof
that I have conquered Britain.

1053
02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:46.398
Go on!

1054
02:19:42.499 --> 02:19:43.565
Kill!

1055
02:20:05.979 --> 02:20:09.103
While all of you were
living safely here in Rome,

1056
02:20:09.601 --> 02:20:12.270
your beloved Emperor
was risking his life

1057
02:20:12.350 --> 02:20:15.732
to preserve and enlarge the Empire.

1058
02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:23.523
I've heard rumors

1059
02:20:23.643 --> 02:20:26.598
that the Senate doesn't believe
that I ever went to Britain.

1060
02:20:26.678 --> 02:20:28.996
No. No, lord.

1061
02:20:29.076 --> 02:20:31.137
But I did conquer Britain

1062
02:20:31.217 --> 02:20:35.065
and I have a hundred thousand
papyrus canes to prove it.

1063
02:20:38.441 --> 02:20:42.107
- Hail, Caligula Caesar!
- Hail, Caesar!

1064
02:20:42.227 --> 02:20:47.107
- Hail, Caligula the Conqueror!
- Hail! Hail! Hail!

1065
02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:50.929
Better be careful,
he's in a strange mood tonight.

1066
02:21:03.283 --> 02:21:03.982
Caligula...

1067
02:21:05.579 --> 02:21:07.284
they hate you now.

1068
02:21:07.364 --> 02:21:10.346
Let them hate me.
So long as they fear me.

1069
02:21:10.426 --> 02:21:12.190
They are senators and consuls.

1070
02:21:12.270 --> 02:21:13.982
They are important men.

1071
02:21:14.473 --> 02:21:16.690
So important that
they approve all I do?

1072
02:21:17.096 --> 02:21:18.482
They must be mad.

1073
02:21:18.602 --> 02:21:20.499
I don't know what else to do
to provoke them.

1074
02:21:20.579 --> 02:21:23.908
Great victory in Britain!

1075
02:21:26.185 --> 02:21:27.330
And now...

1076
02:21:28.244 --> 02:21:32.900
the bounties captured
during this great campaign.

1077
02:21:35.352 --> 02:21:36.177
Fish.

1078
02:21:37.852 --> 02:21:41.323
Smoult, herring and salmon.

1079
02:21:42.737 --> 02:21:44.155
Oysters...

1080
02:21:45.352 --> 02:21:48.743
and beautiful pink pearls.

1081
02:21:49.432 --> 02:21:53.982
From the blue seas
and silver rivers of Britain.

1082
02:21:57.268 --> 02:22:01.165
Gained from the green forests...

1083
02:22:01.873 --> 02:22:04.648
and golden ponds of Britain...

1084
02:22:05.659 --> 02:22:10.315
wild pheasants, lovesome geese.

1085
02:22:27.383 --> 02:22:28.815
Cowards.

1086
02:22:34.188 --> 02:22:37.394
Crawl! Crawl! Crawl!

1087
02:22:37.893 --> 02:22:40.273
I hate them!

1088
02:22:47.588 --> 02:22:49.357
Almighty Caesar says...

1089
02:22:50.290 --> 02:22:52.428
to balance the state budget

1090
02:22:52.508 --> 02:22:55.315
we shall confiscate
the entire estates...

1091
02:22:55.435 --> 02:22:57.653
of all those who have failed Rome.

1092
02:23:02.248 --> 02:23:04.740
Read out your list, Longinus.

1093
02:23:06.926 --> 02:23:08.656
Senators Galva...

1094
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:11.224
Aponius...

1095
02:23:11.304 --> 02:23:12.597
Marcellus...

1096
02:23:13.133 --> 02:23:14.341
Antonius...

1097
02:23:15.149 --> 02:23:16.163
Cassius...

1098
02:23:16.785 --> 02:23:17.461
Chaerea...

1099
02:23:18.462 --> 02:23:21.273
They have failed me. Arrest them.

1100
02:23:21.393 --> 02:23:22.540
Lepidus...

1101
02:23:24.652 --> 02:23:27.130
Sextus and Octavius.

1102
02:23:27.637 --> 02:23:28.648
Guards, arrest them.

1103
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:48.588
Almighty Caesar says...

1104
02:23:48.668 --> 02:23:50.357
finish your dinner.

1105
02:23:53.143 --> 02:23:53.940
Eat!

1106
02:24:02.246 --> 02:24:03.523
He must be done soon.

1107
02:24:09.148 --> 02:24:10.563
Watch Chaerea.

1108
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:12.140
Why?

1109
02:24:12.593 --> 02:24:14.232
The omens are not good.

1110
02:24:14.871 --> 02:24:16.330
Be on your guard.

1111
02:24:18.572 --> 02:24:21.226
I think he intends to kill me.

1112
02:24:26.207 --> 02:24:27.607
What is amusing, Caesar?

1113
02:24:29.130 --> 02:24:30.590
Just a thought.

1114
02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:33.440
May I ask what thought?

1115
02:24:37.203 --> 02:24:40.023
Is it true that there's a conspiracy
against me, Longinus?

1116
02:24:40.747 --> 02:24:43.398
Well, lord... that is... I mean...

1117
02:24:43.953 --> 02:24:46.629
It seems there is a secret plot.

1118
02:24:46.709 --> 02:24:49.148
A plot is always a secret, if it's not
a secret, it's not a plot but a plan.

1119
02:24:49.228 --> 02:24:51.319
That is logical, is it not, Claudius?

1120
02:24:51.399 --> 02:24:53.499
Even a half-wit can know that
and you're a half-wit.

1121
02:24:53.579 --> 02:24:55.683
Half of me is, Caesar.

1122
02:24:58.671 --> 02:25:00.744
The situation's gone too far.

1123
02:25:00.824 --> 02:25:02.841
He has mocked the guards,
overruled the government

1124
02:25:02.921 --> 02:25:04.857
and insulted
the best families in Rome.

1125
02:25:04.937 --> 02:25:07.529
Yes, the Senate counts
for nothing anymore.

1126
02:25:07.629 --> 02:25:09.107
No one is safe from him.

1127
02:25:09.227 --> 02:25:10.607
He's a tyrant.

1128
02:25:10.727 --> 02:25:12.321
Then what can we do?

1129
02:25:12.421 --> 02:25:14.482
There's only one solution.

1130
02:25:15.919 --> 02:25:18.648
- If Caligula were to die...
- It could happen.

1131
02:26:21.919 --> 02:26:23.324
You need sleep.

1132
02:26:24.257 --> 02:26:27.781
I think I shall have to resign
myself to living forever.

1133
02:26:29.146 --> 02:26:30.660
I hope you do.

1134
02:26:48.988 --> 02:26:50.398
I am going bald.

1135
02:26:54.586 --> 02:26:55.952
No, you're not.

1136
02:26:56.497 --> 02:26:59.013
You've never been able
to face the facts, have you?

1137
02:26:59.602 --> 02:27:00.744
The facts?

1138
02:27:01.577 --> 02:27:03.091
Yes, my lord.

1139
02:27:03.836 --> 02:27:04.989
Can you?

1140
02:27:13.125 --> 02:27:16.111
I need some sleep.

1141
02:27:19.701 --> 02:27:21.197
I need you.

1142
02:27:50.073 --> 02:27:51.238
Are you ready?

1143
02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:54.737
Will you speak
your lying sister Isis?

1144
02:27:57.059 --> 02:28:01.605
Long have I wandered
in the land of men

1145
02:28:01.685 --> 02:28:05.241
in search of you, brother Osiris.

1146
02:28:12.782 --> 02:28:16.739
I have been killed
and cut in two bits.

1147
02:28:18.848 --> 02:28:24.818
You put my pieces together,
bringing back life...

1148
02:28:25.444 --> 02:28:26.607
with a kiss.

1149
02:28:29.185 --> 02:28:30.732
There goes our blood.

1150
02:28:35.018 --> 02:28:38.859
It doesn't matter.
It's only a show.

1151
02:28:49.789 --> 02:28:53.039
- I can't get it right.
- No, Caesar. Look, like that.

1152
02:28:57.838 --> 02:28:59.059
Hello, precious.

1153
02:29:03.945 --> 02:29:05.315
Have you been a good girl?

1154
02:29:13.543 --> 02:29:15.980
Don't you think she looks
beautiful in my costume?

1155
02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:18.163
- She's even wearing my little boots.
- Cause you like her power.

1156
02:29:18.243 --> 02:29:20.887
My little... boots.

1157
02:29:44.733 --> 02:29:46.080
She's serious.

1158
02:29:52.493 --> 02:29:54.340
Going to be dressed
like you today.

1159
02:30:24.943 --> 02:30:25.648
Password?

1160
02:30:27.937 --> 02:30:28.945
Scrotum.

1161
02:30:29.025 --> 02:30:30.148
So be it.

1162
02:31:14.177 --> 02:31:15.148
I'll...

1163
02:31:16.421 --> 02:31:17.413
live...

1164
02:31:19.281 --> 02:31:20.390
live...

1165
02:32:15.703 --> 02:32:16.686
Guards!

1166
02:32:20.695 --> 02:32:23.176
Hail, Claudius Caesar!

1167
02:32:23.256 --> 02:32:25.732
- Hail, Claudius Caesar!
- Hail, Claudius!
