00:02:33.482 --> 00:02:35.248
Darling Drusilla...

2
00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:43.479
I have existed
from the morning of the world...

3
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:47.561
...and I shall exist until the last star
falls from the heavens.

4
00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.596
Although I have taken the
form of Caius Caligula...

5
00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:53.794
I am all men as I
am no man and so...

6
00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:55.479
...I am a god.

7
00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:46.499
What's it like with Marcellus?

8
00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:47.976
What's 'what' like?

9
00:05:49.343 --> 00:05:50.960
He's so fat.

10
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.828
He's disgusting.

11
00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:54.351
He's not.

12
00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:56.234
He's only large.

13
00:05:56.914 --> 00:05:58.843
But tiny where it counts.

14
00:06:00.296 --> 00:06:01.786
How do you know?

15
00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:05.414
I saw him at the baths.

16
00:06:09.546 --> 00:06:11.632
Poor, poor Drusilla.

17
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.468
You are vile!

18
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:20.837
- Halt!
- Message for the Prince.

19
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.718
- Identify yourself.
- Macro.

20
00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:26.601
Password?

21
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.835
Justice.

22
00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:49.484
Prince?

23
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.265
Forgive me, Prince.

24
00:06:55.921 --> 00:06:58.203
The Emperor commands you
to wait upon him.

25
00:06:58.805 --> 00:06:59.906
What does he want?

26
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:01.695
A last look at you perhaps.

27
00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:03.624
He is 77.

28
00:07:04.085 --> 00:07:05.710
May he live forever!

29
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.718
How is Ennia?

30
00:07:12.992 --> 00:07:17.070
My wife lives only for the day
she can see you again, Prince.

31
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:22.031
Wait outside.

32
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.546
What does all this mean?

33
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:44.078
Take care, Little-Boots.

34
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.085
Pray to Isis for me.

35
00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.313
I'll follow you
as soon as I can.

36
00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:06.179
I hate coming back here, Macro.

37
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.601
He's planning something.

38
00:08:12.445 --> 00:08:13.835
You've nothing to fear.

39
00:08:14.498 --> 00:08:16.359
I command the Praetorian guards.

40
00:08:16.773 --> 00:08:19.289
With Tiberius,
there's always something to fear.

41
00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:21.554
Be very careful of Nerva.

42
00:08:21.873 --> 00:08:24.218
They say he can even tell
what you're thinking.

43
00:08:28.953 --> 00:08:29.578
Nerva.

44
00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:31.015
- Prince.
- Dear friend.

45
00:08:31.986 --> 00:08:33.898
Ten years is a long
time for the Emperor...

46
00:08:34.078 --> 00:08:35.500
to be hidden away.

47
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.164
I should feel a great deal happier...

48
00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:39.210
...if he were back in
Rome where he belongs.

49
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.679
Tell me, how is the Emperor?

50
00:08:42.663 --> 00:08:44.140
Old, like me.

51
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.578
I mean, how is his mood?

52
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:49.242
Like the weather.

53
00:08:49.804 --> 00:08:51.656
Oh, the weather's good today.

54
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.460
Changeable.

55
00:08:57.767 --> 00:08:59.509
I've heard that
during the last month...

56
00:08:59.884 --> 00:09:02.493
seven of my colleagues in the
Senate have been put to death...

57
00:09:02.962 --> 00:09:03.970
...for treason.

58
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.368
Nine to be exact.

59
00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:08.634
Five of them cheated.

60
00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:10.579
They killed themselves.

61
00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:13.571
That wasn't playing fair.

62
00:09:15.223 --> 00:09:16.478
Don't you agree, Nerva?

63
00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:20.118
They were all good men.

64
00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:25.068
If they were good men...

65
00:09:25.188 --> 00:09:27.540
...how could their beloved Emperor
find them guilty?

66
00:09:28.464 --> 00:09:30.376
You have a gift for logic, Prince.

67
00:10:21.581 --> 00:10:22.915
Caligula.

68
00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.439
- Beloved grandfather.
- Do your dance, boy!

69
00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:36.728
- My dance?
- Yes.

70
00:10:37.198 --> 00:10:38.516
The one you
delighted the army with...

71
00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:40.345
when your father
made you its mascot.

72
00:10:40.784 --> 00:10:41.603
Come on...

73
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.446
Little-Boots.

74
00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:49.673
- I've forgotten it, Lord.
- Oh, dance for me.

75
00:10:50.989 --> 00:10:52.056
Delight me.

76
00:10:53.842 --> 00:10:54.814
Dance!

77
00:11:06.294 --> 00:11:07.931
My little fishies.

78
00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:09.759
Fishies.

79
00:11:12.518 --> 00:11:15.962
Alright, my little fishies. Come in.

80
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:17.298
All of you.

81
00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:16.423
Stop that!

82
00:12:40.717 --> 00:12:42.470
Out, little fishies!

83
00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:44.689
You've had enough for today.

84
00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:50.923
- Caligula.
- Yes, my Lord?

85
00:12:51.215 --> 00:12:54.064
Why do you say such monstrous things
about me at Rome?

86
00:12:54.392 --> 00:12:56.759
I hear you often
pray for my death.

87
00:12:57.058 --> 00:12:58.485
I don't, Lord, ever.

88
00:12:58.648 --> 00:12:59.704
You do not?

89
00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:03.032
By Heaven, Caesar,
I swear I do not.

90
00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:05.282
You do not... yes...

91
00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:07.204
...in public.

92
00:13:09.328 --> 00:13:10.509
Never, Lord.

93
00:13:10.986 --> 00:13:12.400
Remember this.

94
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.251
That I have let you live...

95
00:13:18.926 --> 00:13:20.095
...so far.

96
00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:23.673
My little fishies love me.

97
00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:26.638
Innocents, you see.

98
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.380
I protect their innocence.

99
00:13:33.451 --> 00:13:35.263
It is the least I can do.

100
00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.451
For it is a foul world.

101
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:39.216
Away you now!

102
00:13:42.448 --> 00:13:44.592
Nerva is scowling at us.

103
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.323
Help me, Nerva.

104
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.806
Help me transform this
young barbarian...

105
00:13:48.926 --> 00:13:50.313
into a Roman Caesar.

106
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.472
There have been
three Roman Caesars.

107
00:13:52.862 --> 00:13:55.355
Julius, Augustus and yourself.

108
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.878
Which do you want him to be?

109
00:13:57.957 --> 00:13:58.691
The best.

110
00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:01.292
That would be your
father, Augustus.

111
00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:04.511
You see, Caligula,
I'm insulted to my face.

112
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.644
Nerva, dear friend.

113
00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:11.511
Watch out for Macro
when I am dead.

114
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.606
I know.

115
00:14:15.175 --> 00:14:18.058
- He hates me...
- ...because you are wise.

116
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.487
Because you are good.

117
00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:24.519
So, when I am gone...

118
00:14:25.417 --> 00:14:27.034
...watch out for Macro.

119
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.495
I have taken my precautions, Caesar.

120
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.433
Hmm. What might they be?

121
00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:43.847
Heaven help Rome...

122
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.339
...when I'm gone.

123
00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:49.045
I am old.

124
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:52.243
Yes, Lord, but you will live forever.

125
00:14:52.327 --> 00:14:57.759
All my family are dead but you,
child Gemellus and that...

126
00:14:58.026 --> 00:14:59.956
...Claudius, that uncle.

127
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.362
The others struck down by fate.

128
00:15:06.022 --> 00:15:10.816
And it is fate, Little-Boots,
that rules us, not any god.

129
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.201
You are a god, Lord.

130
00:15:15.537 --> 00:15:18.766
No, I'm not.
Not even when I am dead.

131
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.115
Julius Caesar and
Augustus Caesar...

132
00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.388
They are gods.

133
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.120
So say the Senate...

134
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.115
and so the people
prefer to believe.

135
00:15:26.701 --> 00:15:28.013
Such myths are useful.

136
00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:39.209
Little-Boots...

137
00:15:39.685 --> 00:15:41.076
just look at you.

138
00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:42.638
Yes, Caesar?

139
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.466
I am nursing a viper...

140
00:15:52.193 --> 00:15:53.826
...in Rome's bosom.

141
00:16:08.147 --> 00:16:09.209
Uncle!

142
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.420
Caligula!

143
00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:29.209
Do you think
this boy has been drinking?

144
00:16:30.722 --> 00:16:33.748
- I think he has, Caesar.
- So do I. Macro!

145
00:16:33.982 --> 00:16:35.935
- Yes, Lord?
- Bring him more wine.

146
00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:37.615
And waste none.

147
00:16:45.595 --> 00:16:47.232
Remove your bootlaces!

148
00:17:28.766 --> 00:17:31.091
And what do they
say of me at Rome?

149
00:17:31.478 --> 00:17:34.381
Oh, well, they need you,
Lord, and they miss you.

150
00:17:35.017 --> 00:17:38.052
Most of my life I have given
to the Roman people.

151
00:17:38.464 --> 00:17:39.826
I have fought.

152
00:17:41.766 --> 00:17:43.170
I have given all.

153
00:17:46.777 --> 00:17:49.638
- Aren't they lovely?
- Yes, Lord.

154
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:51.584
The satyrs are from Illyria.

155
00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.256
And... uh...

156
00:17:57.764 --> 00:17:58.897
This nymph...

157
00:18:00.161 --> 00:18:02.029
...is from... Where are you from?

158
00:18:03.769 --> 00:18:04.935
Britain, Lord.

159
00:18:05.907 --> 00:18:06.802
Britain.

160
00:18:07.693 --> 00:18:08.974
Speaking statues.

161
00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:09.982
Yes, yes.

162
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.127
And they do more than speak.
They do...

163
00:18:17.649 --> 00:18:19.622
You prefer nymphs to satyrs?

164
00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:21.763
I like both, Lord.

165
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.294
One needs both.

166
00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.646
Yes. To keep healthy.

167
00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:33.886
Rome is a republic and
you and I are plain citizens.

168
00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:35.997
More conviction!

169
00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:02.716
That's it!

170
00:19:27.677 --> 00:19:29.710
That's the best of my stallions.

171
00:19:31.469 --> 00:19:33.532
Serve the state, Caligula...

172
00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:37.007
...although the people
in it are wicked beasts.

173
00:19:37.257 --> 00:19:38.968
But they love you, Lord.

174
00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:40.776
Oh, no. No.

175
00:19:41.366 --> 00:19:42.933
They fear me.

176
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.734
And that is much better.

177
00:19:52.111 --> 00:19:53.843
I had no choice, you see.

178
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.538
No choice.

179
00:19:56.802 --> 00:19:58.062
No choice?

180
00:19:59.022 --> 00:20:01.202
All I wanted was private life.

181
00:20:02.722 --> 00:20:04.851
I did not truly want
to become emperor,

182
00:20:05.503 --> 00:20:06.351
but I had to.

183
00:20:06.924 --> 00:20:07.840
Had to?

184
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.585
If someone else
had become emperor...

185
00:20:10.524 --> 00:20:12.015
I would have been killed.

186
00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:15.226
As you will be.

187
00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.007
Will be?

188
00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.296
Will be gra... gr...

189
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:53.429
"Will be", Grandfather?

190
00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:56.343
Would be, if you were not my heir.

191
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:01.131
When Rome was just
a city and we were just citizens...

192
00:21:02.048 --> 00:21:04.642
...known to one another.
Do you see?

193
00:21:05.634 --> 00:21:09.783
Why, we were frugal, good,
disciplined and dignified!

194
00:21:18.293 --> 00:21:21.064
The Romans I rule
are not what they were.

195
00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:22.634
They lust.

196
00:21:23.447 --> 00:21:26.204
They lust for power
and pleasure.

197
00:21:26.928 --> 00:21:29.790
Money...
the wives of other men...

198
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.939
Oh, yes,
I am a true moralist.

199
00:21:35.188 --> 00:21:37.415
And stern as any Cato.

200
00:21:40.202 --> 00:21:43.517
Fate chose me to govern swine
in my old age...

201
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:45.751
I am become a swine-herd.

202
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:50.408
Do you think this boy has
drunk enough wine?

203
00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:52.751
I think he's drunk enough, Lord.

204
00:21:52.898 --> 00:21:54.009
So do I.

205
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.040
Now he is happy.

206
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:16.079
Homer. You would not know that,

207
00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:18.549
you were educated
in army camps only.

208
00:22:18.604 --> 00:22:20.204
You will know enough
to be a swine-herd.

209
00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:23.755
Caesar? The Senate sends these
documents for your signature.

210
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.868
Of course.

211
00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:34.595
The revised list of candidates
for the equestrian order.

212
00:22:34.858 --> 00:22:38.040
I, Tiberius Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the People...

213
00:22:38.939 --> 00:22:39.978
...of Rome.

214
00:22:41.747 --> 00:22:44.431
Tax assessment, for Asia Minor,
Brescia and Gaul.

215
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.775
I, Tiberius Caesar,
command in the name...

216
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.486
...of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

217
00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.236
Senator guilty of treason.

218
00:22:57.755 --> 00:23:00.774
Every senator believes
himself to be a potential Caesar.

219
00:23:00.834 --> 00:23:03.853
Therefore every senator
is guilty of treason.

220
00:23:04.763 --> 00:23:06.290
In thought, if not in deed.

221
00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:10.540
The Senate is the natural enemy
of any Caesar, Little-Boots.

222
00:23:11.239 --> 00:23:12.423
Remember that.

223
00:23:12.784 --> 00:23:14.314
Traitors. Look at them.

224
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.673
Traitors.

225
00:23:20.653 --> 00:23:25.204
They offered to approve
any law I made before I made it.

226
00:23:25.845 --> 00:23:26.603
I said...

227
00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:28.798
'What if I go mad? What then?'

228
00:23:31.145 --> 00:23:32.290
No answer.

229
00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:34.603
They were born to be slaves,

230
00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.447
Germanicus, never forget that.

231
00:23:36.735 --> 00:23:40.035
I'm not Germanicus, Lord.
I'm his son, Caligula.

232
00:23:40.182 --> 00:23:42.962
Yes. And your friend is Macro.

233
00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.970
He serves you and
only you, Lord.

234
00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:48.025
And his wife
is your friend, too.

235
00:23:48.532 --> 00:23:50.079
Is she friendly in bed?

236
00:23:51.064 --> 00:23:53.085
We must ask Macro that, Lord.

237
00:23:53.388 --> 00:23:54.872
She seems friendly.

238
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.395
And your sister, Drusilla...

239
00:23:58.588 --> 00:24:00.986
My sister is my sister, Lord.

240
00:24:02.472 --> 00:24:05.392
I know everything
that is said and done.

241
00:24:07.138 --> 00:24:08.556
And thought.

242
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:12.452
The setting sun...

243
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.540
...and the rising moon.

244
00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:19.868
Gemellus...

245
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:24.228
Lovely boy. And too young
to betray me.

246
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.103
Well, perhaps not too young.

247
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.393
Yes. Kiss your old grandfather.

248
00:24:30.689 --> 00:24:32.657
Yes. My last grandson.

249
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.439
I am your grandson, too, Caesar.

250
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.026
By adoption.

251
00:24:37.951 --> 00:24:40.970
This is the last flesh of my flesh.

252
00:24:42.103 --> 00:24:44.728
Poor boy.
What's to become of you?

253
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.943
He's like a brother to me, Lord.

254
00:24:47.058 --> 00:24:49.844
Brother?
You know what a brother is in our family.

255
00:24:50.564 --> 00:24:52.400
Brother kills a brother...

256
00:24:52.786 --> 00:24:54.587
...who's killed his father...

257
00:24:55.103 --> 00:24:56.759
...who's killed his son.

258
00:24:57.012 --> 00:24:59.380
Fate! Drink, Caligula.

259
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.783
After you, dear brother.

260
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.377
Poor boy.

261
00:25:16.677 --> 00:25:17.948
When I am gone...

262
00:25:19.026 --> 00:25:20.880
...Caligula will kill you.

263
00:25:22.234 --> 00:25:23.385
And then...

264
00:25:23.807 --> 00:25:26.333
...someone will kill Caligula.

265
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.838
Unless...

266
00:25:34.252 --> 00:25:36.673
Unless he is dead before I am.

267
00:25:38.002 --> 00:25:40.891
You are looking not well at all.

268
00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:59.174
I, Caligula Caesar...

269
00:26:00.288 --> 00:26:04.285
...command in the name
of the Senate and the People of Rome.

270
00:26:19.306 --> 00:26:23.345
A brother kills a brother,
a brother kills his father...

271
00:26:23.668 --> 00:26:28.009
who's killed his son... Fate!

272
00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:31.929
And then
someone must kill Caligula...

273
00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:37.165
He's going to kill me.

274
00:26:37.588 --> 00:26:40.878
Shh. You're safe. You're with me.

275
00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:45.134
He's going to kill us.

276
00:26:45.846 --> 00:26:50.673
Just the way he killed our father,
our mother and our brothers.

277
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.723
I am not going to die!

278
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:00.746
You won't.

279
00:27:00.981 --> 00:27:03.941
You're his heir.
There is no one else.

280
00:27:05.098 --> 00:27:06.270
Yes...

281
00:27:07.496 --> 00:27:08.864
There's Gemellus...

282
00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:11.973
...and Claudius.

283
00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:15.223
Gemellus is too young.

284
00:27:15.598 --> 00:27:17.020
Claudius is an idiot...

285
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.129
...and Tiberius is old.

286
00:27:19.364 --> 00:27:20.606
You will be emperor.

287
00:27:20.871 --> 00:27:21.817
Soon.

288
00:27:28.706 --> 00:27:30.754
And you will be my queen.

289
00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:33.465
You can't marry your sister.

290
00:27:35.075 --> 00:27:36.575
You can in Egypt.

291
00:27:36.684 --> 00:27:38.075
But we're in Rome.

292
00:27:38.294 --> 00:27:40.239
And you're already promised.

293
00:27:45.184 --> 00:27:47.668
I know... To Ennia.

294
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.543
It's only a bird.

295
00:28:09.129 --> 00:28:11.692
- Prince?
- Hmm? What is it?

296
00:28:12.671 --> 00:28:13.848
My wife.

297
00:28:17.205 --> 00:28:18.809
Ennia.

298
00:28:34.923 --> 00:28:36.653
Now you are a man, Caligula.

299
00:28:37.106 --> 00:28:38.637
What are you going to do?

300
00:28:39.501 --> 00:28:42.989
You must be the master
of your own destiny.

301
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:47.012
Take it... with both hands.

302
00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:13.207
Cretins!

303
00:29:13.965 --> 00:29:16.255
Why did you permit him to do it?

304
00:29:19.164 --> 00:29:20.926
Bind his wrists.

305
00:29:21.988 --> 00:29:23.434
Bind his wrists.

306
00:29:30.699 --> 00:29:32.707
You must not go,
you must not leave me.

307
00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:34.731
You're my friend, my only friend.

308
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.567
I've lived too long, Tiberius,
I hate my life.

309
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:41.582
Leave us.

310
00:29:42.188 --> 00:29:43.332
Both of you.

311
00:29:43.819 --> 00:29:45.853
For a man to choose
the hour of his own death...

312
00:29:46.459 --> 00:29:49.957
...is the closest he will ever come
to tricking fate.

313
00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:53.392
And fate decrees
that when you die...

314
00:29:53.446 --> 00:29:55.033
...Macro will kill me.

315
00:29:55.165 --> 00:29:57.739
I'll arrest him
and have him executed.

316
00:29:57.884 --> 00:30:00.306
You can't. He controls you.

317
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.226
Anyway, even with Macro dead...

318
00:30:04.408 --> 00:30:07.329
...how could I go on
living with this...

319
00:30:08.007 --> 00:30:09.275
...reptile?

320
00:30:12.439 --> 00:30:15.685
You will respect my friend always,
won't you, reptile?

321
00:30:15.785 --> 00:30:17.876
I've always respected him, Lord.

322
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.608
You hear?

323
00:30:20.063 --> 00:30:22.795
Tiberius, you were wise once.

324
00:30:22.915 --> 00:30:25.540
Ah, don't taunt me, I am old.

325
00:30:26.048 --> 00:30:28.837
I've watched you grow
into a monster.

326
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.750
One by one, I've seen you
murder your family...

327
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.672
...your friends,
the noblest men in Rome.

328
00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:38.732
- That is treason!
- No, it's the truth.

329
00:30:40.574 --> 00:30:43.767
I am, and I always have been,
surrounded by enemies.

330
00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:46.337
In my own family.

331
00:30:46.884 --> 00:30:48.212
In the Senate.

332
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:50.909
You're cruel!

333
00:30:51.126 --> 00:30:56.173
No, honest. Old men
can sometimes see the future.

334
00:30:56.664 --> 00:30:59.803
So, from evils past...

335
00:31:00.994 --> 00:31:03.212
...and evils yet to come...

336
00:31:04.597 --> 00:31:07.431
...I now choose to escape.

337
00:31:17.587 --> 00:31:19.775
So these are your precautions,
Nerva?

338
00:31:53.797 --> 00:31:55.751
Nerva, what's it like?

339
00:31:56.087 --> 00:31:58.244
Warm, no pain.

340
00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:00.884
Just drifting away.

341
00:32:01.574 --> 00:32:03.267
- Do you see her?
- Who?

342
00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:05.540
The Goddess, Isis.

343
00:32:05.684 --> 00:32:07.649
So, you're one of those
who believe...

344
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:09.220
Do you see her?

345
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:12.267
No.

346
00:32:12.548 --> 00:32:13.713
Are you sure?

347
00:32:18.973 --> 00:32:20.587
You're almost dead.

348
00:32:20.845 --> 00:32:23.236
What's it like?
What's happening to you now?

349
00:32:24.189 --> 00:32:25.166
Nothing.

350
00:32:25.915 --> 00:32:27.009
You're lying.

351
00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:29.244
You can see her.
I know you can.

352
00:32:29.442 --> 00:32:30.674
What is she like?

353
00:32:30.923 --> 00:32:32.067
No...

354
00:32:33.322 --> 00:32:34.681
Nothing at all.

355
00:32:36.944 --> 00:32:37.915
Just...

356
00:32:39.665 --> 00:32:41.009
...sleep.

357
00:32:42.415 --> 00:32:44.415
Liar.

358
00:34:04.181 --> 00:34:07.486
Since Nerva died,
Tiberius has been half-paralyzed.

359
00:34:07.658 --> 00:34:09.477
They say he's close to death.

360
00:34:09.502 --> 00:34:11.697
Tiberius dies,
be worse for us.

361
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:13.150
You love the bastard.

362
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.134
Take that back!

363
00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:05.759
Prince...

364
00:35:06.158 --> 00:35:07.861
The physician Charicles.

365
00:35:26.965 --> 00:35:28.243
How is the Emperor?

366
00:35:29.134 --> 00:35:30.575
How long will he last?

367
00:35:30.963 --> 00:35:32.915
Well, it could happen any moment.

368
00:35:33.103 --> 00:35:35.626
But with care he might last
a year or so.

369
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.978
I can smell death.

370
00:35:44.363 --> 00:35:45.564
But whose?

371
00:35:45.813 --> 00:35:47.033
Don't worry.

372
00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:49.103
He can do nothing without me.

373
00:35:50.275 --> 00:35:53.103
So these poor
unfortunate creatures thought...

374
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.314
And where are they?

375
00:35:56.839 --> 00:35:57.872
No, Macro.

376
00:35:58.958 --> 00:36:00.412
He's planning something.

377
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:02.537
You'll be emperor soon.

378
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.349
You swear.

379
00:36:17.833 --> 00:36:18.810
I sw...

380
00:36:37.572 --> 00:36:39.044
I swear.

381
00:37:23.756 --> 00:37:24.888
Leave.

382
00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:26.646
Everyone leave.

383
00:38:14.182 --> 00:38:15.495
Tiberius.

384
00:38:22.565 --> 00:38:24.050
Tiberius.

385
00:39:32.241 --> 00:39:33.870
Caligula?

386
00:39:35.649 --> 00:39:36.573
Lord?

387
00:39:38.073 --> 00:39:40.589
Give me my ring.

388
00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:49.800
No.

389
00:39:51.223 --> 00:39:51.956
Yes.

390
00:40:04.487 --> 00:40:08.409
You do not dare!

391
00:40:09.426 --> 00:40:10.447
Prince.

392
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.277
You do not dare!

393
00:41:27.067 --> 00:41:28.403
Hail, Caesar.

394
00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:32.981
Hail, Caesar.

395
00:41:33.121 --> 00:41:35.099
I'd get everyone assembled in the hall.

396
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.358
For the announcement.

397
00:42:27.705 --> 00:42:29.092
Gemellus?

398
00:42:32.381 --> 00:42:33.686
Gemellus.

399
00:42:41.046 --> 00:42:42.514
Hail, Caesar.

400
00:42:46.413 --> 00:42:47.624
Gemellus.

401
00:42:49.014 --> 00:42:50.366
We are alone.

402
00:42:58.514 --> 00:43:00.217
We must love each other.

403
00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:18.207
Rest, Tiberius Caesar.

404
00:43:21.433 --> 00:43:26.131
Hail, Caligula Caesar.

405
00:43:31.855 --> 00:43:33.592
It's just like the dream.

406
00:43:36.858 --> 00:43:40.300
It's only his mask.
You are Caesar now.

407
00:43:42.043 --> 00:43:43.038
Caesar.

408
00:43:43.232 --> 00:43:45.638
Caesar, Emperor of Rome.

409
00:43:46.467 --> 00:43:47.928
Lord of the world.

410
00:43:49.214 --> 00:43:51.214
Lord of the world...

411
00:43:52.757 --> 00:43:54.475
I like this dream.

412
00:44:16.115 --> 00:44:17.202
At the...

413
00:44:25.767 --> 00:44:27.983
At the insistence of the Senate...

414
00:44:28.694 --> 00:44:30.624
...and the People of Rome...

415
00:44:31.986 --> 00:44:33.272
...I accept...

416
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.335
...humbly...

417
00:44:36.873 --> 00:44:40.592
...the highest office
of our great republic.

418
00:44:46.523 --> 00:44:48.413
Our great republic.

419
00:45:06.838 --> 00:45:09.731
The onion. Where's the onion?
Give me the onion.

420
00:45:36.701 --> 00:45:38.711
When our beloved Tiberius was dying...

421
00:45:38.811 --> 00:45:42.202
- To the Tiber with Tiberius!
- Yes! Yes!

422
00:45:43.104 --> 00:45:45.702
- Throw him in the river!
- Yes. Yes.

423
00:45:47.636 --> 00:45:50.739
Tiberius... Throw him!
Throw him to the dogs!

424
00:45:50.859 --> 00:45:54.491
Today we begin a new era.

425
00:45:54.913 --> 00:45:57.866
I grant a general amnesty.

426
00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.966
Hail! Hail! Hail!

427
00:46:00.775 --> 00:46:03.420
Caesar. Caesar.
Caesar. Caesar. Caesar.

428
00:46:04.671 --> 00:46:08.466
Caesar. Caesar.
Caesar. Caesar. Caesar.

429
00:46:08.601 --> 00:46:10.036
- Silence!
- Caesar. Caesar.

430
00:46:10.136 --> 00:46:11.616
Caesar. Caesar. Caesar. Caesar.

431
00:46:11.716 --> 00:46:12.800
- Silence!
- Caesar. Caesar.

432
00:46:12.888 --> 00:46:15.295
Great Caesar is not finished.

433
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.891
As my fellow Consul...

434
00:46:24.037 --> 00:46:26.917
...the Senate and the
People of Rome...

435
00:46:26.956 --> 00:46:30.038
...have wisely chosen
my learned uncle Claudius.

436
00:46:30.163 --> 00:46:31.733
Hail, Claudius!

437
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.741
Take your place
beside me, Claudius.

438
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.881
- Caesar Caligula...
- Take your place...

439
00:46:42.991 --> 00:46:44.452
I mean Consul...

440
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.225
I herewith adopt as
my son and heir...

441
00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:57.428
...the Prince Gemellus.

442
00:46:58.172 --> 00:47:01.052
- Come forward, Prince.
- Hail, Gemellus!

443
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.984
From this moment,
all official oaths...

444
00:47:17.104 --> 00:47:19.249
will contain the following phrase:..

445
00:47:20.178 --> 00:47:24.452
'I will value neither my life,
nor the lives of my children...'

446
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.795
'...any more highly
than I do the Emperor.'

447
00:47:28.022 --> 00:47:29.506
Hail. Hail. Hail.

448
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.163
'And of his sister, Drusilla.'

449
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.842
- Hail Drusilla.
- Hail Caligula.

450
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:57.788
We must be careful of him.

451
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.186
Oh, Claudius?

452
00:48:05.295 --> 00:48:07.147
No, Gemellus.

453
00:48:09.964 --> 00:48:12.788
Oh, yes. Gemellus.

454
00:48:18.722 --> 00:48:20.169
Did you see their faces
when I told them

455
00:48:20.289 --> 00:48:22.381
they had to swear
not only to me...

456
00:48:23.148 --> 00:48:24.249
...but to you?!

457
00:48:24.859 --> 00:48:26.100
They were appalled.

458
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:29.800
I do hope so.

459
00:48:30.366 --> 00:48:31.819
But is it wise?

460
00:48:39.734 --> 00:48:40.772
I can do...

461
00:48:50.732 --> 00:48:52.420
...anything I like...

462
00:48:57.431 --> 00:48:58.444
...to anyone.

463
00:49:00.569 --> 00:49:02.389
Well, don't start with me!

464
00:49:04.855 --> 00:49:06.616
Then who would you suggest?

465
00:50:08.084 --> 00:50:11.088
Get out! Out!

466
00:50:13.573 --> 00:50:14.657
Who?

467
00:50:15.609 --> 00:50:17.741
Why not start with Macro?

468
00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.358
- Macro?!
- Yes.

469
00:50:20.796 --> 00:50:23.889
Before he controls you
as he controlled Tiberius.

470
00:50:27.271 --> 00:50:29.991
Superb display, Macro.
Superb.

471
00:50:37.675 --> 00:50:39.022
Fetch me Gemellus.

472
00:50:39.795 --> 00:50:40.960
What, here?

473
00:50:43.327 --> 00:50:44.928
Yes, here. Now.

474
00:50:52.362 --> 00:50:54.131
- Charicles.
- My Lord?

475
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:55.460
Stand here.

476
00:51:00.876 --> 00:51:02.599
I want a bonus for my guards.

477
00:51:03.223 --> 00:51:04.710
Er, but Caesar,
that's not possible.

478
00:51:04.884 --> 00:51:06.876
All things that happen
are possible, Longinus.

479
00:51:07.062 --> 00:51:09.444
Make the impossible happen,
and it will be possible. Logical?

480
00:51:09.582 --> 00:51:11.905
How, Caesar?
The deficit, you see, is...

481
00:51:12.025 --> 00:51:14.280
Look, how much is my purse?

482
00:51:14.607 --> 00:51:17.100
Well, Lord, that is as much
as you may require.

483
00:51:17.404 --> 00:51:18.350
Oh, good.

484
00:51:19.405 --> 00:51:20.538
Ah, Macro.

485
00:51:20.866 --> 00:51:22.670
Would you stand over there?

486
00:51:27.733 --> 00:51:29.858
Longinus, you here.

487
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.163
Here, Caesar.

488
00:51:32.913 --> 00:51:34.147
Gemellus.

489
00:51:35.335 --> 00:51:38.436
I want you to look at these
gentlemen very carefully.

490
00:51:40.173 --> 00:51:43.173
Take your time and tell me...

491
00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.474
...who killed our beloved Tiberius, hmm?

492
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:56.561
Who killed Tiberius?

493
00:52:14.038 --> 00:52:14.967
He did!

494
00:52:16.547 --> 00:52:17.684
Macro.

495
00:52:27.179 --> 00:52:28.319
Murderer.

496
00:52:38.453 --> 00:52:39.608
Arrest him.

497
00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.715
In honour of your new commander,
Chaerea...

498
00:53:01.538 --> 00:53:03.959
...ten gold pieces to every man.

499
00:53:04.177 --> 00:53:07.678
Hail! Hail! Hail!

500
00:53:10.163 --> 00:53:12.240
Chaerea, arrest Macro.

501
00:53:12.795 --> 00:53:14.624
Guards, arrest Macro.

502
00:53:17.124 --> 00:53:18.788
Don't you dare.

503
00:53:49.018 --> 00:53:50.663
Forgive me, Caesar...

504
00:53:52.635 --> 00:53:53.624
Ah, Chaerea.

505
00:53:53.688 --> 00:53:55.710
Two senators beg to see you.

506
00:53:56.015 --> 00:53:57.717
They have a dispute over land.

507
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.420
And await your judgment.

508
00:54:00.199 --> 00:54:01.366
Well, bring them in.

509
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:02.928
Bring them in.

510
00:54:03.749 --> 00:54:06.319
I am interested in
all that is Rome...

511
00:54:06.788 --> 00:54:09.312
Even down to the length
of the toga.

512
00:54:10.011 --> 00:54:11.139
Come now.

513
00:54:25.418 --> 00:54:27.752
Caesar, I must complain
about the vow...

514
00:54:27.872 --> 00:54:29.835
Give me the documents!

515
00:54:57.249 --> 00:54:58.280
Guilty.

516
00:54:58.421 --> 00:54:59.918
Thank you. Thank you, Caesar.

517
00:55:00.103 --> 00:55:01.342
Don't thank me.

518
00:55:02.514 --> 00:55:05.807
Justice must always
be impartial.

519
00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:09.538
That is so, Chaerea. Is it not?

520
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.188
Oh yes, Caesar.

521
00:55:12.436 --> 00:55:13.600
You may go.

522
00:55:51.834 --> 00:55:52.944
Ennia.

523
00:56:02.369 --> 00:56:03.663
You look beautiful.

524
00:56:11.691 --> 00:56:13.319
Is it good for growing hair?

525
00:56:15.354 --> 00:56:16.749
We'll be married soon.

526
00:56:16.835 --> 00:56:18.725
The divorce will
only take a few days.

527
00:56:22.167 --> 00:56:25.311
- I think we should move.
- Move? Where?

528
00:56:27.405 --> 00:56:29.436
Alexandria, say.

529
00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.108
To Egypt?

530
00:56:33.375 --> 00:56:34.342
Yeah.

531
00:56:35.897 --> 00:56:37.006
What do you think?

532
00:56:37.299 --> 00:56:41.241
I'd hate to leave Rome.
I mean, the Senate...

533
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.991
No, no, Ennia. I am Rome.

534
00:56:44.374 --> 00:56:46.499
Wherever I am, Rome is.

535
00:56:46.725 --> 00:56:49.421
And there is the Senate
and the People of Rome.

536
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:55.569
You do make me laugh.
The way you say that!

537
00:57:05.928 --> 00:57:09.608
- Ah, Longinus.
- Forgive us, Caesar.

538
00:57:14.694 --> 00:57:16.522
Longinus, is it done?

539
00:57:16.678 --> 00:57:20.062
- The Senate has sentenced him
to death. - Well, good.

540
00:57:22.891 --> 00:57:24.194
The commission.

541
00:57:29.393 --> 00:57:32.225
Chaerea, I now officially
appoint you...

542
00:57:32.288 --> 00:57:34.397
...commander of my imperial guard.

543
00:57:36.072 --> 00:57:37.718
But what about Macro?

544
00:57:37.874 --> 00:57:39.952
What's happened?
Where is he?

545
00:57:40.176 --> 00:57:41.921
He has been arrested
for treason.

546
00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:44.440
That's impossible.

547
00:57:45.018 --> 00:57:46.928
Caesar, you know
he worshipped you.

548
00:57:47.225 --> 00:57:48.702
He made you.

549
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:57.600
Nobody made me.

550
00:57:58.186 --> 00:58:00.741
I... I can't believe it.

551
00:58:01.697 --> 00:58:03.124
What did he do?

552
00:58:04.306 --> 00:58:05.350
Ennia...

553
00:58:06.577 --> 00:58:10.171
I had to take my destiny,
with my own hands.

554
00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:22.631
Guards.

555
00:58:22.934 --> 00:58:23.897
Guards.

556
00:58:27.553 --> 00:58:29.699
Chaerea... She's to be banished.

557
00:58:31.018 --> 00:58:32.842
- I love you.
- To Gaul.

558
00:58:33.461 --> 00:58:35.397
- Lift.
- I love you!

559
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:40.969
Caligula. How could you do it?
He was your friend.

560
00:58:41.272 --> 00:58:43.374
He would've done
anything for you.

561
00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.358
Don't send me away!

562
00:58:46.306 --> 00:58:47.624
I love you!

563
00:58:48.767 --> 00:58:50.506
Caligula.

564
00:58:53.402 --> 00:58:56.061
Now at least she doesn't
have to get a divorce.

565
00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:58.936
But you still have to find
a suitable wife.

566
00:59:00.006 --> 00:59:00.936
No.

567
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.999
I'm going to marry you.

568
00:59:09.006 --> 00:59:11.444
You can't.
We're not Egyptians.

569
00:59:12.803 --> 00:59:13.835
I know.

570
00:59:15.047 --> 00:59:16.850
We are much more beautiful.

571
00:59:17.375 --> 00:59:18.991
Rome is not Egypt.

572
00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.186
And stop looking at yourself
like that.

573
00:59:25.343 --> 00:59:26.811
Let's go to Egypt then.

574
00:59:27.292 --> 00:59:28.592
You are a fool.

575
00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:31.171
Caesar cannot be a fool.

576
00:59:31.296 --> 00:59:32.905
But he's trying very hard.

577
00:59:32.967 --> 00:59:36.038
Caesar cannot be a fool.

578
00:59:36.872 --> 00:59:39.921
Little-Boots...
They'll throw you in the Tiber...

579
00:59:40.171 --> 00:59:41.975
...if you attempt
to move the government.

580
00:59:42.475 --> 00:59:45.995
So, you are going to marry
a respectable Roman lady...

581
00:59:46.103 --> 00:59:48.194
...of the senatorial class.

582
00:59:51.128 --> 00:59:53.046
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

583
00:59:53.317 --> 00:59:54.842
You've got to have an heir.

584
00:59:58.706 --> 01:00:00.841
Who will kill me
when he grows up.

585
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.427
The priestesses of Isis are meeting
at my house tonight.

586
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:10.255
You want me
to marry one of them?

587
01:00:10.709 --> 01:00:11.552
Yes.

588
01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:12.779
No!

589
01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.021
Yes.

590
01:00:15.647 --> 01:00:16.615
No!

591
01:00:18.546 --> 01:00:19.458
Yes.

592
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.497
I wonder what I should wear.

593
01:01:06.154 --> 01:01:08.060
When is the performance
for almighty Caesar?

594
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.005
Don't be disgusting.

595
01:01:10.068 --> 01:01:12.802
But I'm being practical.
If I'm to choose a wife,

596
01:01:12.841 --> 01:01:14.568
I want to see what I'm getting.

597
01:01:15.322 --> 01:01:16.177
Logic.

598
01:01:44.141 --> 01:01:46.435
Now that one looks
rather interesting.

599
01:01:47.238 --> 01:01:50.622
Livia? Oh, she's taken.
She's to marry Proculus...

600
01:01:50.927 --> 01:01:52.021
...one of your officers.

601
01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:53.396
I'll send him to Spain.

602
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:56.841
She's a virgin. Very boring.
Not your style.

603
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:09.630
- That will be my wife.
- Oh, no. Not Caesonia.

604
01:03:10.694 --> 01:03:12.904
Oh. You're impossible.

605
01:03:13.004 --> 01:03:16.257
She's the most promiscuous
woman in Rome.

606
01:03:16.306 --> 01:03:17.269
Perfect.

607
01:03:26.132 --> 01:03:30.394
Caesonia's been divorced.
She's extravagant. Always in debt.

608
01:03:31.156 --> 01:03:32.194
I want her.

609
01:03:32.839 --> 01:03:34.199
But not for a wife.

610
01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:37.129
Send her to me now.

611
01:03:37.504 --> 01:03:39.847
No, Little-Boots.
I won't let you do it.

612
01:03:40.689 --> 01:03:42.136
It wouldn't be wise.

613
01:03:46.048 --> 01:03:47.074
Yes.

614
01:03:47.617 --> 01:03:51.058
Such is the will of the Senate
and the People of Rome.

615
01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:04.168
You were very convincing
as a priestess, Caesar.

616
01:06:06.339 --> 01:06:07.536
And you...

617
01:06:08.221 --> 01:06:11.151
...as a sacrificial lamb, Caesonia.

618
01:07:23.686 --> 01:07:26.311
I told Caesonia that
I would marry her.

619
01:07:27.462 --> 01:07:28.261
Don't do it.

620
01:07:28.381 --> 01:07:30.397
Ah, but only after
she had borne me a son.

621
01:07:30.497 --> 01:07:32.069
How will you ever know it's yours?

622
01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:35.451
Don't worry.
I've got her very well guarded.

623
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.912
Then you can be sure
one of the guards will be the father.

624
01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:42.678
They're all homosexuals
who've been castrated.

625
01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.846
If only all Rome had just one neck.

626
01:08:45.431 --> 01:08:47.970
Is that the officer that
Livia's going to marry?

627
01:08:50.176 --> 01:08:51.610
Yes. Proculus.

628
01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:53.868
Proculus.

629
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:58.457
- Longinus...
- Caesar?

630
01:08:58.566 --> 01:09:01.810
...you see this young officer
over here? Proculus?

631
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:03.809
- Yeah?
- I want to...

632
01:09:51.318 --> 01:09:55.057
Caligula Caesar,
Emperor of Rome.

633
01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.153
- Hail!
- Hail!

634
01:10:00.146 --> 01:10:03.060
And the lady Drusilla
and the lady Caesonia.

635
01:10:03.156 --> 01:10:06.300
And the lady Drusilla
and the lady Caesonia.

636
01:10:06.588 --> 01:10:08.588
- Hail.
- Hail.

637
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.363
- Are we late?
- No, Caesar.

638
01:10:15.463 --> 01:10:16.880
Do forgive us.

639
01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:19.653
Was the ceremony beautiful?

640
01:10:20.028 --> 01:10:21.294
The auguries good?

641
01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.591
Yes, Caesar.

642
01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:24.739
Splendid!

643
01:10:27.148 --> 01:10:28.581
Come on, come on!

644
01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.661
You are very gracious to come.

645
01:10:44.328 --> 01:10:46.193
You are a Roman hero.

646
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.075
Caesar.

647
01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:01.265
I shall now bestow...

648
01:11:01.693 --> 01:11:04.419
...the special blessings
of almighty Caesar...

649
01:11:04.819 --> 01:11:06.372
...upon this...

650
01:11:07.656 --> 01:11:09.052
...happy union.

651
01:11:13.572 --> 01:11:16.052
Which way is the
sacred marriage bed?

652
01:11:37.954 --> 01:11:39.497
Ah. The kitchen!

653
01:11:39.982 --> 01:11:41.380
Well, this will have to do.

654
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:46.152
See you later.

655
01:11:46.314 --> 01:11:47.349
Little-Boots...!

656
01:11:48.118 --> 01:11:50.474
I thought you didn't like virgins.

657
01:11:51.003 --> 01:11:52.348
I've never known any.

658
01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:57.989
That is correct, Caesonia?

659
01:12:03.872 --> 01:12:06.341
And now for Caesar's wedding gift.

660
01:12:15.579 --> 01:12:17.912
What a delicious bride.

661
01:12:22.161 --> 01:12:23.544
Take off that robe.

662
01:12:33.574 --> 01:12:34.982
Splendid.

663
01:12:50.124 --> 01:12:52.286
Is she really a
virgin, Proculus?

664
01:12:52.857 --> 01:12:54.377
Yes, Caesar.

665
01:12:55.922 --> 01:12:58.162
One can never be quite sure.

666
01:13:00.764 --> 01:13:03.513
Open your eyes, Livia.

667
01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:26.536
Lucky girl. To lose one's virginity...

668
01:13:27.422 --> 01:13:30.193
...to a direct descendant
of the goddess Venus.

669
01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.364
I...

670
01:13:33.537 --> 01:13:35.595
...Caligula Caesar...

671
01:13:36.049 --> 01:13:37.193
...command...

672
01:13:38.203 --> 01:13:40.504
Open your eyes, Proculus.

673
01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:43.560
...command in the
name of the Senate...

674
01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:44.895
Open them!

675
01:13:48.477 --> 01:13:50.044
...the Senate...

676
01:13:51.112 --> 01:13:53.239
...and the People of...

677
01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:55.349
...Rome!

678
01:14:21.304 --> 01:14:22.989
She really was a virgin!

679
01:14:26.144 --> 01:14:27.622
Are you?

680
01:14:33.525 --> 01:14:35.099
Well? Are you?

681
01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:38.606
- No, Caesar.
- No?

682
01:14:39.137 --> 01:14:40.603
Well, Isis won't like that.

683
01:14:40.755 --> 01:14:43.396
One law for woman, one for man.
That's not fair.

684
01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.122
Come on.
Off with your clothes!

685
01:14:57.123 --> 01:14:58.294
Splendid.

686
01:15:01.503 --> 01:15:04.727
I like your nice
bushy hair, Proculus.

687
01:15:05.526 --> 01:15:07.474
No, Caesar. I beg you.

688
01:15:07.758 --> 01:15:09.380
So sit up.

689
01:15:20.752 --> 01:15:22.600
I think you were lying to me.

690
01:15:24.362 --> 01:15:26.451
You're a virgin, too.

691
01:15:44.976 --> 01:15:46.022
I...

692
01:15:46.715 --> 01:15:48.715
...Caligula Caesar...

693
01:15:49.025 --> 01:15:52.340
...command...
in the name of the Senate...

694
01:15:53.188 --> 01:15:54.952
Open your eyes, Livia.

695
01:15:55.675 --> 01:15:59.350
...and the People of Rome...

696
01:16:11.451 --> 01:16:15.585
You see how I have exhausted myself
in order to make your wedding holy.

697
01:16:24.593 --> 01:16:26.155
My blessings to you both.

698
01:17:01.185 --> 01:17:02.507
Gemellus.

699
01:17:13.936 --> 01:17:15.655
Caligula.

700
01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:17.725
Caligula.

701
01:17:24.148 --> 01:17:26.050
Gemellus.

702
01:17:53.526 --> 01:17:56.088
Jupiter loves me.

703
01:18:00.915 --> 01:18:02.389
Drusilla.

704
01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:14.483
- He's trying to kill me.
- Who, Little-Boots?

705
01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.703
Gemellus.

706
01:18:17.476 --> 01:18:20.695
I saw him. He ran away.
He wants me dead.

707
01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:34.570
There, Little-Boots.

708
01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:40.358
Now you'll be alright.

709
01:18:46.563 --> 01:18:47.616
There...

710
01:23:48.539 --> 01:23:50.157
Hail, Caesar!

711
01:23:50.274 --> 01:23:51.703
- Hail.
- Hail, Caesar.

712
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:55.466
All hail Caesars beautiful horse,
Incitatus.

713
01:23:55.883 --> 01:23:58.336
Hail the most honorable Incitatus.

714
01:23:58.726 --> 01:24:00.878
Hail, Incitatus.

715
01:24:03.591 --> 01:24:06.814
There's Gemellus over there.
Watch him.

716
01:24:23.502 --> 01:24:25.837
Chop chop, dear uncle, chop chop.

717
01:24:26.999 --> 01:24:28.907
I want your honest advice.

718
01:24:29.984 --> 01:24:32.345
Should I make myself king of Rome?

719
01:24:32.462 --> 01:24:37.090
King?
Well, but this is a republic, isn't it?

720
01:24:38.082 --> 01:24:39.470
Very well, then.

721
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:43.701
I shall make myself
king of the republic.

722
01:24:43.801 --> 01:24:46.610
But you're already greater
than any king, Caesar.

723
01:24:47.774 --> 01:24:49.360
I am a god.

724
01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.267
Or at least I will be when I'm dead.

725
01:25:07.052 --> 01:25:10.570
Gemellus, try one of these morays.
Gemellus.

726
01:25:18.521 --> 01:25:19.850
What's that smell?

727
01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.424
What smell, Caesar?

728
01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:22.643
What have you been taking?

729
01:25:22.763 --> 01:25:25.298
Just a medicine.
But to ward off the fever.

730
01:25:26.052 --> 01:25:27.782
Did you give him
medicine for the fever?

731
01:25:27.985 --> 01:25:28.462
Well...

732
01:25:28.545 --> 01:25:30.985
- Yes or no?
- No, lord, no.

733
01:25:32.248 --> 01:25:36.858
Gemellus. Are you accusing your
sovereign of being a poisoner?

734
01:25:36.978 --> 01:25:39.001
But I never accused you, Caesar.

735
01:25:39.203 --> 01:25:42.391
You took an antidote
before coming to my table.

736
01:25:42.772 --> 01:25:45.884
Which is tantamount to
accusing me of poisoning you.

737
01:25:46.284 --> 01:25:48.364
That is logic! Is it not?

738
01:25:48.663 --> 01:25:50.103
Caligula.

739
01:26:05.184 --> 01:26:06.501
Chaerea.

740
01:26:08.332 --> 01:26:10.332
Arrest Gemellus...

741
01:26:10.888 --> 01:26:12.134
...for treason.

742
01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:14.446
Guards. Take him away.

743
01:26:20.616 --> 01:26:22.480
No, Caesar, please!

744
01:26:22.714 --> 01:26:23.806
No!

745
01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:28.106
No!

746
01:26:37.552 --> 01:26:40.587
As if there ever could be
an antidote against Caesar.

747
01:26:50.555 --> 01:26:51.696
Drusilla.

748
01:26:52.644 --> 01:26:54.345
Why are you so
concerned for him?

749
01:26:54.469 --> 01:26:56.087
I'm not concerned for him.

750
01:26:56.522 --> 01:26:58.970
- But for you.
- He knows about Tiberius.

751
01:26:59.163 --> 01:27:00.290
He's a threat to me.

752
01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:02.806
He's not. He's not
even your heir.

753
01:27:03.594 --> 01:27:06.064
Caesonia now carries your child.

754
01:27:09.787 --> 01:27:11.829
Gemellus will die.

755
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:14.006
You amateur.

756
01:27:14.519 --> 01:27:15.767
Amateur?

757
01:28:10.298 --> 01:28:12.509
And they weren't even poisoned.

758
01:28:19.581 --> 01:28:20.739
Caesar!

759
01:28:26.723 --> 01:28:27.915
Caesar?

760
01:28:36.538 --> 01:28:39.215
- Well done!
- Thank you.

761
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:42.048
What will you do to her?
What she said was treason.

762
01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.651
I decide what is treason, not you.

763
01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.245
Dance.

764
01:28:52.182 --> 01:28:54.135
- Dance?
- Yes.

765
01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.643
And what about your son?

766
01:28:57.129 --> 01:29:00.507
Show Incitatus your new dance.

767
01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.987
My son...

768
01:29:03.475 --> 01:29:04.893
...he will dance with you.

769
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.323
Music!

770
01:31:06.706 --> 01:31:09.081
You are... beautiful...

771
01:31:11.677 --> 01:31:13.026
...Drusilla...

772
01:31:14.009 --> 01:31:15.385
...beautiful.

773
01:31:16.628 --> 01:31:18.245
We are alone...

774
01:31:18.681 --> 01:31:20.458
...alone, Drusilla.

775
01:31:58.937 --> 01:32:00.125
He's going to kill me.

776
01:32:00.308 --> 01:32:01.039
No.

777
01:32:01.179 --> 01:32:02.444
He's going to kill me.

778
01:32:05.242 --> 01:32:07.101
The fever must break soon.

779
01:32:07.570 --> 01:32:08.695
He's going to kill me.

780
01:32:08.843 --> 01:32:10.507
- What if it doesn't?
- He's going to kill me.

781
01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:13.070
He's going to kill me.

782
01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:16.242
Drusilla.

783
01:32:16.995 --> 01:32:18.226
Drusilla.

784
01:32:18.771 --> 01:32:20.265
He's going to kill me.

785
01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.601
He's going to kill...

786
01:32:22.954 --> 01:32:24.015
...me.

787
01:32:28.011 --> 01:32:29.429
Drusilla.

788
01:32:29.918 --> 01:32:31.453
I tell you...

789
01:32:32.084 --> 01:32:33.906
...I love you, Drusilla.

790
01:32:33.907 --> 01:32:35.984
He's going to kill me.

791
01:32:46.941 --> 01:32:49.661
- Where is my sister?
- She's coming.

792
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:06.078
I'm here, Little-Boots.

793
01:33:10.447 --> 01:33:11.882
Drusilla...

794
01:33:13.032 --> 01:33:14.242
...I'm dying.

795
01:33:14.773 --> 01:33:16.354
You are not.

796
01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:18.929
I must...

797
01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:21.039
...make my will.

798
01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:23.437
Don't talk. Sleep.

799
01:33:24.255 --> 01:33:27.257
Longinus.
I want Longinus.

800
01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:34.985
Take my horse to his own bed.

801
01:33:38.358 --> 01:33:39.429
He's a monster.

802
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.343
Even so, it's better that
he doesn't die at this time.

803
01:33:42.523 --> 01:33:44.399
- I don't see why.
- The people love him.

804
01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:48.039
There could be a war, revolution,
civil chaos, if he dies.

805
01:33:48.159 --> 01:33:50.640
It looks as if he's going
to die anyway.

806
01:33:54.165 --> 01:33:55.398
Longinus?

807
01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.843
You call for me, Caesar?

808
01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.500
My will.

809
01:34:24.507 --> 01:34:27.304
Herewith, to my beloved Drusilla...

810
01:34:30.599 --> 01:34:32.460
...the Roman Empire...

811
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:35.875
...title...

812
01:34:36.968 --> 01:34:38.149
...of Augusta...

813
01:34:46.704 --> 01:34:48.812
...my little boots.

814
01:34:55.348 --> 01:34:56.585
Little boo...

815
01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.718
He's sleeping.

816
01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.812
No, he's not.

817
01:35:31.153 --> 01:35:32.304
Drusilla.

818
01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:35.859
Why do I get angry with you?

819
01:35:37.303 --> 01:35:39.015
Why do we always argue?

820
01:35:39.757 --> 01:35:41.140
You can't help it.

821
01:35:42.315 --> 01:35:43.875
We'll never quarrel again.

822
01:35:44.106 --> 01:35:45.617
Oh, yes, we will.

823
01:35:50.356 --> 01:35:51.843
Don't let me die.

824
01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.940
My lady. You must not touch him.

825
01:36:07.117 --> 01:36:09.028
The fever is contagious.

826
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:12.687
Sleep. You're safe now.

827
01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:14.695
Drusilla's here.

828
01:36:14.974 --> 01:36:16.773
I offer my life...

829
01:36:17.334 --> 01:36:24.007
...if Jupiter will only spare
our beloved Emperor.

830
01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.781
Jupiter accepts your offer.

831
01:36:32.657 --> 01:36:34.031
Execute him.

832
01:36:43.473 --> 01:36:45.281
The fever is breaking.

833
01:36:46.419 --> 01:36:48.109
Do you hear that, Little-Boots?

834
01:36:48.488 --> 01:36:49.835
You're going to live.

835
01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.742
Drusilla tells me that
I've been neglecting my work.

836
01:36:57.832 --> 01:36:59.487
So I report for duty.

837
01:36:59.650 --> 01:37:02.648
Your signature
and seal is required, lord.

838
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:11.371
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

839
01:37:11.539 --> 01:37:13.210
...of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

840
01:37:22.159 --> 01:37:25.351
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name of the...

841
01:37:27.195 --> 01:37:28.781
...Senate... and...

842
01:37:31.374 --> 01:37:32.820
...People of Rome.

843
01:37:37.467 --> 01:37:39.070
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

844
01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:40.867
of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

845
01:37:41.192 --> 01:37:42.820
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

846
01:37:43.014 --> 01:37:44.203
of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

847
01:37:44.404 --> 01:37:45.284
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

848
01:37:45.384 --> 01:37:46.153
of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

849
01:37:46.253 --> 01:37:47.037
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

850
01:37:47.137 --> 01:37:47.821
of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

851
01:37:47.921 --> 01:37:48.493
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

852
01:37:48.593 --> 01:37:49.091
of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

853
01:37:49.191 --> 01:37:49.958
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

854
01:37:50.058 --> 01:37:50.727
of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

855
01:37:50.827 --> 01:37:52.937
Rome, Rome, Caesar, Caesar,

856
01:37:53.037 --> 01:37:54.343
Rome, Rome, rubbish,
rubbish, rubbish.

857
01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.765
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name...

858
01:38:03.856 --> 01:38:05.484
of the Senate and
the People of Rome.

859
01:38:11.417 --> 01:38:13.484
No wonder life's so dull.

860
01:38:13.579 --> 01:38:16.421
Yes, lord... oh... no,
lord... er lord...

861
01:38:16.534 --> 01:38:19.932
Let's see if Proculus
can liven things up for us.

862
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:30.281
Proculus.

863
01:38:42.949 --> 01:38:45.703
Do you know that his wife is
expecting her first child?

864
01:38:46.210 --> 01:38:48.578
We're not quite sure
who the father is.

865
01:38:48.821 --> 01:38:51.421
Him or... God.

866
01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:56.611
Divine Caesar, please!

867
01:38:57.304 --> 01:38:59.710
What have I done?
Why am I here?

868
01:39:00.612 --> 01:39:01.523
Treason.

869
01:39:02.015 --> 01:39:04.405
I've always been loyal to you.

870
01:39:04.652 --> 01:39:06.872
That is your treason.

871
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.820
You're an honest man, Proculus,
which means a bad Roman.

872
01:39:10.992 --> 01:39:13.328
Therefore you're a traitor.

873
01:39:13.546 --> 01:39:15.242
Logical, hmm?

874
01:39:28.150 --> 01:39:30.750
Now you must die like Gemellus.

875
01:39:31.731 --> 01:39:33.992
Like all those who fail Rome.

876
01:39:53.309 --> 01:39:57.500
Now slowly, very slowly.

877
01:39:58.421 --> 01:40:00.539
I want him to feel death.

878
01:40:00.718 --> 01:40:03.632
I want him to smell death.

879
01:40:15.585 --> 01:40:18.625
Now, what does it
feel like, Proculus?

880
01:40:19.297 --> 01:40:21.945
Can you see the
great goddess Isis?

881
01:40:22.117 --> 01:40:23.804
What does she say?

882
01:40:29.269 --> 01:40:30.625
Reptile!

883
01:40:31.802 --> 01:40:33.359
Make a note of this.

884
01:40:51.487 --> 01:40:53.898
I said slowly, you fool.

885
01:41:13.264 --> 01:41:17.554
Lucky boy,
to have escaped me so easily.

886
01:41:36.472 --> 01:41:39.328
Longinus. Reptile.

887
01:41:40.007 --> 01:41:42.422
Cut off those and
send them to Livia...

888
01:41:42.536 --> 01:41:45.500
...as a souvenir of their great love.

889
01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.981
Caesar says, 'Cut them off.'

890
01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:37.563
And now send the rest to Livia.

891
01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.466
Curtain.

892
01:43:27.630 --> 01:43:28.815
The child's head...

893
01:43:29.091 --> 01:43:30.662
...has just appeared.

894
01:43:37.233 --> 01:43:39.318
- Is he alive?
- Yes, Caesar.

895
01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.444
My lords...

896
01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.664
I'm now to be married
to Caesonia.

897
01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:53.640
The mother of my son,
Caligula Germanicus.

898
01:44:01.465 --> 01:44:04.004
Caligula. Caesonia.

899
01:44:04.112 --> 01:44:06.031
Ring, ring... Give me the ring!

900
01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:28.523
You are now wife, mother
and Empress of Rome.

901
01:44:30.556 --> 01:44:32.030
It's a girl.

902
01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.280
It's a girl.

903
01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:40.640
It is not a girl.
Did you not hear Caesar say?

904
01:44:40.889 --> 01:44:44.460
I heard the voice of Caesar,
but your daughter did not.

905
01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.062
I should've waited, shouldn't I?

906
01:44:56.273 --> 01:44:57.851
There will be other children.

907
01:45:08.484 --> 01:45:10.665
- Longinus.
- Caesar?

908
01:45:12.373 --> 01:45:16.569
One month of free games
and a gold coin to every Roman...

909
01:45:17.155 --> 01:45:20.296
...to celebrate the birth of my son.

910
01:45:23.058 --> 01:45:24.874
My son...

911
01:45:25.655 --> 01:45:28.276
...Julia Drusilla.

912
01:45:28.494 --> 01:45:31.241
Julia Drusilla.

913
01:45:31.456 --> 01:45:35.400
Drusilla? Drusilla?

914
01:45:39.552 --> 01:45:40.679
Drusilla.

915
01:45:41.377 --> 01:45:43.788
- It's the fever.
- Drusilla!

916
01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:46.194
The fever.

917
01:46:16.793 --> 01:46:17.976
Drusilla.

918
01:46:21.557 --> 01:46:22.616
I'm here...

919
01:46:23.095 --> 01:46:24.491
...it's your Little-Boots.

920
01:46:28.494 --> 01:46:30.101
It's your Little-Boots.

921
01:46:37.688 --> 01:46:39.032
Do something.

922
01:46:39.391 --> 01:46:42.462
I am doing everything I...
I can, Caesar.

923
01:46:42.586 --> 01:46:46.446
I swear.
But the fever must take its course.

924
01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:07.985
My great Isis, save her.

925
01:47:09.354 --> 01:47:10.743
Take me!

926
01:47:12.467 --> 01:47:16.282
Caesar begs you,
oh mighty goddess.

927
01:47:21.264 --> 01:47:22.345
Caesar.

928
01:47:56.547 --> 01:47:58.071
Drusilla?

929
01:49:11.786 --> 01:49:15.017
Get out. Get out.
Go on. Get out. Get out!

930
01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:21.131
Get out. Go on.
Out. Out. Out!

931
01:49:33.228 --> 01:49:34.392
Drusilla.

932
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:43.728
Almighty mother...

933
01:49:48.210 --> 01:49:49.142
You...

934
01:49:59.859 --> 01:50:01.298
I begged you...

935
01:50:03.623 --> 01:50:05.790
Caesar begged you...

936
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:30.602
Drusilla!

937
01:53:52.092 --> 01:53:55.793
We, Caius Caesar
Caligula, do decree...

938
01:53:55.926 --> 01:53:58.098
...one month of public mourning...

939
01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:00.653
...for our beloved sister, Drusilla.

940
01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:04.020
During which time
anyone who laughs...

941
01:54:04.228 --> 01:54:07.206
...bathes, dines with his
parents or children...

942
01:54:07.306 --> 01:54:10.481
...or has intercourse,
will be sentenced to death.

943
01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.215
Such is the will of the Senate
and the People of Rome.

944
01:54:32.453 --> 01:54:33.387
Hello.

945
01:54:58.753 --> 01:55:00.254
Come on, darling.

946
01:55:11.997 --> 01:55:15.376
Empire is headless!

947
01:55:15.837 --> 01:55:18.028
Caligula has fled.

948
01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.801
Mnester restores the imperial head.

949
01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:31.153
The slaves of Rome.

950
01:55:43.095 --> 01:55:45.095
The people.

951
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:56.426
The army.

952
01:56:02.473 --> 01:56:06.426
The tribune of the people.

953
01:56:16.879 --> 01:56:18.668
The Senate.

954
01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:50.434
And reigning supreme...
the Emperor.

955
01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:00.152
Hail!

956
01:57:00.505 --> 01:57:09.918
And I am...
the lady Drusilla, his sister.

957
01:57:10.038 --> 01:57:16.660
Let's make love once again,
brother Mnester.

958
01:57:20.146 --> 01:57:21.316
No. No!

959
01:57:23.019 --> 01:57:23.809
Stop!

960
01:57:25.116 --> 01:57:26.277
Stop!

961
01:57:28.601 --> 01:57:30.277
No. Stop!

962
01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:24.655
Another drunk. Come on.

963
01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:05.629
Do you have any news of him?

964
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:17.941
According to one report...

965
01:59:19.082 --> 01:59:20.902
...he's gone to Egypt.

966
01:59:22.551 --> 01:59:24.731
And according to
the other reports?

967
01:59:25.856 --> 01:59:26.965
Well...

968
01:59:27.848 --> 01:59:29.035
...to Greece...

969
01:59:29.652 --> 01:59:31.379
...another, to Persia...

970
01:59:32.934 --> 01:59:36.449
...to Carthage,
and another again, to Gaul.

971
01:59:38.918 --> 01:59:41.537
And where do you think he is?

972
01:59:43.215 --> 01:59:44.715
He could be anywhere.

973
01:59:45.361 --> 01:59:46.184
No.

974
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:48.300
He's here in Rome.

975
01:59:49.379 --> 01:59:50.918
He's testing us.

976
02:02:35.877 --> 02:02:37.285
Where did he go?

977
02:02:44.186 --> 02:02:45.731
Who is he?

978
02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:51.409
Get off.

979
02:02:55.495 --> 02:02:57.508
I have existed from the
morning of the world.

980
02:02:57.628 --> 02:03:01.009
And I shall exist until the
last star falls from the night.

981
02:03:01.245 --> 02:03:03.995
Although I have taken the form
of Caius Caligula...

982
02:03:04.190 --> 02:03:06.086
...I am all men
as I am no man.

983
02:03:06.186 --> 02:03:08.186
And therefore I am...

984
02:03:10.041 --> 02:03:11.057
...a god.

985
02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:28.065
I shall wait for the unanimous decision
of the Senate, Claudius.

986
02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.471
All those who say aye...

987
02:03:32.033 --> 02:03:33.714
...say 'Aye.'

988
02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:39.745
Aye.

989
02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:43.124
Aye!

990
02:03:43.224 --> 02:03:44.543
- Aye.
- Aye.

991
02:03:44.643 --> 02:03:45.544
- Aye.
- Aye.

992
02:03:45.644 --> 02:03:47.487
Aye. Aye. Aye.

993
02:03:50.469 --> 02:03:52.260
Aye. Aye. Aye.

994
02:03:53.009 --> 02:03:54.854
He's a god now.

995
02:03:56.633 --> 02:03:58.135
Aye. Aye. Aye.

996
02:04:00.891 --> 02:04:02.167
Baa.

997
02:04:02.378 --> 02:04:04.651
- Baa.
- Baa.

998
02:04:05.643 --> 02:04:07.845
- Baa.
- Baa.

999
02:04:08.111 --> 02:04:10.248
- Baa.
- Baa.

1000
02:04:10.531 --> 02:04:12.284
- Baa.
- Baa.

1001
02:04:12.384 --> 02:04:14.384
- Baa.
- Baa.

1002
02:04:14.474 --> 02:04:16.789
- Baa.
- Baa.

1003
02:04:16.889 --> 02:04:18.756
- Baa.
- Baa.

1004
02:04:18.856 --> 02:04:20.588
- Baa.
- Baa.

1005
02:04:20.688 --> 02:04:22.409
- Baa.
- Baa.

1006
02:04:22.509 --> 02:04:27.222
The period of
mourning is now over.

1007
02:04:27.322 --> 02:04:28.499
He's mad.

1008
02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:54.694
Enjoy yourself.

1009
02:04:56.154 --> 02:04:57.334
Take care.

1010
02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.030
Now the fun begins.

1011
02:05:16.668 --> 02:05:19.320
But... ah...
are they going to enjoy it as well?

1012
02:05:19.389 --> 02:05:21.389
I don't know.
Shall we ask them?

1013
02:05:22.210 --> 02:05:23.374
Longinus.

1014
02:05:29.115 --> 02:05:32.615
Ah, Longinus.
My financial wizard.

1015
02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:35.660
We have a question for you.

1016
02:05:36.655 --> 02:05:38.749
Who are the richest men in Rome?

1017
02:05:39.163 --> 02:05:40.194
Who?

1018
02:05:41.256 --> 02:05:42.506
Answer...

1019
02:05:43.639 --> 02:05:45.116
The pimps.

1020
02:05:45.631 --> 02:05:46.881
Question number two.

1021
02:05:48.116 --> 02:05:52.448
Who are the most lascivious sluts
in all of Rome?

1022
02:05:54.963 --> 02:05:56.249
Who?

1023
02:05:57.569 --> 02:05:58.788
Answer...

1024
02:05:59.624 --> 02:06:01.655
The senators' wives.

1025
02:06:02.092 --> 02:06:05.452
So, an imperial brothel.

1026
02:06:05.756 --> 02:06:08.521
A most logical way
to balance the state budget.

1027
02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:49.357
As you can see,
ladies and gentlemen...

1028
02:06:49.457 --> 02:06:51.230
...we have gone to great expense...

1029
02:06:51.329 --> 02:06:54.725
...to bring you the finest flesh
in our empire.

1030
02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:06.200
Five gold pieces.

1031
02:07:08.564 --> 02:07:12.803
Only five gold pieces for each
and every twenty minutes.

1032
02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:15.624
And that's a bargain.

1033
02:07:29.509 --> 02:07:32.416
Aren't they beautiful?

1034
02:07:34.508 --> 02:07:36.437
Superb!

1035
02:07:43.074 --> 02:07:47.194
The most lascivious ladies of the
Roman Empire have come today...

1036
02:07:47.349 --> 02:07:50.530
...to perform their patriotic
duties for all.

1037
02:07:50.972 --> 02:07:53.628
For a mere five gold pieces.

1038
02:07:54.048 --> 02:07:57.728
So give, that they will
remember you well.

1039
02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:02.324
Come on aboard the
imperial bordello...

1040
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:06.253
...and you have your choice of
the finest flesh of the Empire...

1041
02:08:10.498 --> 02:08:14.400
Just five gold pieces for each
and every twenty minutes.

1042
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:15.722
And that's a bargain...

1043
02:08:16.003 --> 02:08:19.082
...because most of the women here
are respectable, married ladies.

1044
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:24.526
Senators' wives.
Whores of blameless reputation.

1045
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:29.378
I'll have to work out
a special rate for you.

1046
02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:38.471
Greetings.
Flavia, come.

1047
02:08:38.871 --> 02:08:39.776
Don't waste time.

1048
02:08:39.924 --> 02:08:43.386
Our senators' wives are
not merely beautiful...

1049
02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:47.128
...like their husbands,
they are insatiable.

1050
02:08:48.025 --> 02:08:51.949
And for only five gold pieces,
to any one of you.

1051
02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:27.683
Enjoy the rights
of those who summon you.

1052
02:09:27.845 --> 02:09:32.128
Take their wives, use them,
abuse them.

1053
02:09:32.402 --> 02:09:34.050
Do as you will with them.

1054
02:09:34.265 --> 02:09:38.746
They are yours.
Just yours for only five...

1055
02:09:38.923 --> 02:09:40.378
Five gold pieces.

1056
02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:46.066
Hairy nipples!

1057
02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.996
Senator Marcellus.

1058
02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:54.861
Your wife will scare
our customers away.

1059
02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.777
Try hot walnuts.

1060
02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.152
Hey, you over there.
Don't stint yourselves.

1061
02:10:02.519 --> 02:10:06.599
The more that you give,
the more they will like it.

1062
02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:43.618
Come and enjoy the skills
perfected by our senators' ladies...

1063
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.040
...while their husbands
slept in the Senate.

1064
02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:24.238
Only five gold pieces.

1065
02:11:24.578 --> 02:11:26.578
Five.

1066
02:11:26.890 --> 02:11:28.519
Senators' wives...

1067
02:11:28.619 --> 02:11:31.682
...whores of blameless reputation.

1068
02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:55.644
He's making prostitutes of
all our wives and daughters.

1069
02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:58.668
He humiliated the Senate
and offended the army.

1070
02:11:59.274 --> 02:12:01.168
That's why the people love him.

1071
02:12:14.511 --> 02:12:17.324
Longinus, you're not
having any fun.

1072
02:12:17.556 --> 02:12:18.824
Enjoy yourself.

1073
02:12:18.854 --> 02:12:20.371
What is your preference?

1074
02:12:20.568 --> 02:12:22.778
Everything and nothing, Caesar.

1075
02:12:25.017 --> 02:12:27.355
You can't have both
for the same price.

1076
02:12:36.207 --> 02:12:38.824
- He's provoking you.
- Only me? Huh.

1077
02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:41.676
He's mad.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

1078
02:12:43.428 --> 02:12:45.347
He knows what he's doing
perfectly well.

1079
02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:49.551
Give him enough rope...
and perhaps...

1080
02:12:49.702 --> 02:12:50.887
He'll hang us all.

1081
02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:36.608
We also have a few
very severe ladies here today.

1082
02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:40.626
You may punish them
or be punished by them.

1083
02:13:41.063 --> 02:13:43.557
Five gold pieces will buy you both.

1084
02:13:44.648 --> 02:13:47.096
Just five gold pieces.

1085
02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.487
Can't you stop plotting
for just a few moments?

1086
02:14:27.173 --> 02:14:28.393
Chaerea.

1087
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:31.260
I hear you have a
taste for little boys.

1088
02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:34.182
- Is that not so?
- No, Caesar. Big boys.

1089
02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:38.143
- My soldiers.
- Are they ready?

1090
02:14:38.432 --> 02:14:39.456
Yes, Caesar.

1091
02:14:40.278 --> 02:14:41.229
Perfect.

1092
02:14:53.087 --> 02:14:55.151
We sail for Britain.

1093
02:15:48.382 --> 02:15:50.382
I'll meet you later. (?*)

1094
02:17:17.096 --> 02:17:21.143
And we are only a few hours march
from Rome.

1095
02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:23.773
And what new madness is this?

1096
02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:30.741
Mars tells me we will
enjoy a great victory.

1097
02:17:36.488 --> 02:17:38.753
- Ah, Chaerea.
- Caesar?

1098
02:17:40.787 --> 02:17:42.765
Are we prepared for the invasion?

1099
02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:44.976
Yes, Caesar...

1100
02:17:46.246 --> 02:17:47.792
...only...

1101
02:17:47.971 --> 02:17:49.241
Only what?

1102
02:17:50.665 --> 02:17:52.195
Where is Britain?

1103
02:17:52.741 --> 02:17:54.030
Where?

1104
02:17:55.295 --> 02:17:56.593
There.

1105
02:17:57.426 --> 02:17:59.437
Ah, yes, lord, there.

1106
02:18:00.253 --> 02:18:03.632
But, eh... there is no enemy.

1107
02:18:05.059 --> 02:18:06.984
There is papyrus cane.

1108
02:18:08.217 --> 02:18:11.413
- Papyrus cane, Divine Caesar?
- Yes, papyrus.

1109
02:18:11.743 --> 02:18:13.663
Don't be so stupid, Chaerea.

1110
02:18:14.018 --> 02:18:17.570
Order my army to attack
and destroy that papyrus.

1111
02:18:18.381 --> 02:18:19.546
Yes, lord.

1112
02:18:24.211 --> 02:18:27.765
After all, we must have some proof
that I conquered Britain.

1113
02:19:42.526 --> 02:19:43.788
Kill!

1114
02:20:05.899 --> 02:20:08.962
While all of you were
living safely here in Rome...

1115
02:20:09.622 --> 02:20:12.056
...your beloved emperor
was risking his life...

1116
02:20:12.371 --> 02:20:14.743
...to preserve and
enlarge the Empire.

1117
02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:23.501
I've heard rumors...

1118
02:20:23.806 --> 02:20:26.446
...that the Senate doesn't believe
that I ever went to Britain.

1119
02:20:26.617 --> 02:20:28.790
No. No, lord.

1120
02:20:29.066 --> 02:20:31.103
Well I did conquer Britain...

1121
02:20:31.173 --> 02:20:34.610
...and I have 100,000
papyrus canes to prove it.

1122
02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:41.429
- Hail, Caligula Caesar.
- Hail, Caesar!

1123
02:20:41.964 --> 02:20:47.114
- Hail, Caligula, Conqueror!
- Hail. Hail. Hail!

1124
02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:50.617
Better be careful,
he's in a strange mood tonight.

1125
02:21:03.267 --> 02:21:04.476
Caligula.

1126
02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:06.985
They hate you now.

1127
02:21:07.265 --> 02:21:10.140
Let them hate me.
So long as they fear me.

1128
02:21:10.343 --> 02:21:14.265
They are senators and consuls.
They are important men.

1129
02:21:14.494 --> 02:21:16.671
So important that
they approve all I do?

1130
02:21:17.078 --> 02:21:18.375
They must be mad.

1131
02:21:18.675 --> 02:21:20.395
I don't know what else to do
to provoke them.

1132
02:21:20.588 --> 02:21:22.195
Great victory.

1133
02:21:22.331 --> 02:21:23.617
In Britain.

1134
02:21:26.003 --> 02:21:27.515
And now...

1135
02:21:28.042 --> 02:21:32.570
...the bounties captured
during this great campaign.

1136
02:21:35.015 --> 02:21:35.929
Fish.

1137
02:21:37.968 --> 02:21:41.132
Smoked herring and salmon.

1138
02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:43.601
Oysters...

1139
02:21:45.350 --> 02:21:48.414
...and beautiful pink pearls.

1140
02:21:49.090 --> 02:21:54.500
From the blue seas
and silver rivers of Britain.

1141
02:21:57.223 --> 02:22:00.570
Gained from the green forests...

1142
02:22:01.877 --> 02:22:04.843
...and golden ponds of Britain.

1143
02:22:05.523 --> 02:22:09.342
Wild pheasants, plump geese.

1144
02:22:27.161 --> 02:22:29.847
Cowards! Sheep!

1145
02:22:34.108 --> 02:22:37.439
Crawl. Crawl. Crawl.

1146
02:22:37.824 --> 02:22:40.556
I hate them!

1147
02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:49.340
Almighty Caesar says...

1148
02:22:50.022 --> 02:22:51.926
...to balance the state budget...

1149
02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:55.270
...we shall confiscate
the entire estates...

1150
02:22:55.325 --> 02:22:57.582
...of all those who have failed Rome.

1151
02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:04.387
Read out your list, Longinus.

1152
02:23:06.759 --> 02:23:12.207
Senators Galba,
Aponius, Marcellus,

1153
02:23:13.158 --> 02:23:16.020
Antonius, Cassius...

1154
02:23:16.676 --> 02:23:17.723
Chaerea.

1155
02:23:18.458 --> 02:23:21.090
They have failed me.
Arrest them.

1156
02:23:21.348 --> 02:23:22.700
...Lepidus...

1157
02:23:24.564 --> 02:23:27.012
...Sextus and Octavius.

1158
02:23:27.483 --> 02:23:29.067
Guards. Arrest them.

1159
02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:48.262
Almighty Caesar says...

1160
02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:49.825
...finish your dinner.

1161
02:23:53.059 --> 02:23:54.184
Eat!

1162
02:24:02.059 --> 02:24:03.567
It must be done soon.

1163
02:24:09.051 --> 02:24:10.301
Watch Chaerea.

1164
02:24:11.191 --> 02:24:12.269
Why?

1165
02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:14.145
The omens are not good.

1166
02:24:14.941 --> 02:24:16.379
Be on your guard.

1167
02:24:18.487 --> 02:24:20.871
I think he intends to kill me.

1168
02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:27.785
What is amusing, Caesar?

1169
02:24:29.104 --> 02:24:30.473
Just a thought.

1170
02:24:30.700 --> 02:24:32.676
May I ask what thought?

1171
02:24:37.017 --> 02:24:40.000
Is it true that there is a conspiracy
against me, Longinus?

1172
02:24:40.367 --> 02:24:43.450
Eh... well, lord... that is... I mean...

1173
02:24:43.672 --> 02:24:46.232
It seems there is a secret plot.

1174
02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:47.684
A plot is always a secret.

1175
02:24:47.723 --> 02:24:49.207
If it's not a secret,
it's not a plot, but a plan.

1176
02:24:49.246 --> 02:24:51.348
That is logical, is it not, Claudius?

1177
02:24:51.395 --> 02:24:53.387
Even a half-wit can know that
and you're a half-wit.

1178
02:24:53.653 --> 02:24:55.317
Half of me is, Caesar.

1179
02:24:58.573 --> 02:25:00.498
The situation's gone too far.

1180
02:25:00.778 --> 02:25:02.604
He's mocked the gods,
overruled the government...

1181
02:25:02.751 --> 02:25:04.817
...and insulted the best families
in Rome.

1182
02:25:04.973 --> 02:25:07.223
Yes, the Senate counts for
nothing anymore.

1183
02:25:07.529 --> 02:25:08.871
No one is safe from him.

1184
02:25:09.116 --> 02:25:11.942
- He's a tyrant.
- But what could we do?

1185
02:25:12.356 --> 02:25:14.371
There's only one solution.

1186
02:25:15.890 --> 02:25:19.239
- If Caligula were to die...
- It could happen.

1187
02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.043
You need to sleep.

1188
02:26:24.375 --> 02:26:27.387
I think I shall have to
resign myself to living forever.

1189
02:26:29.027 --> 02:26:30.481
I hope you do.

1190
02:26:48.874 --> 02:26:50.567
I am going bald.

1191
02:26:54.386 --> 02:26:55.840
No, you're not.

1192
02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:58.856
You've never been able
to face the facts, have you?

1193
02:26:59.511 --> 02:27:00.731
The facts?

1194
02:27:01.473 --> 02:27:02.762
Yes, my lord.

1195
02:27:03.746 --> 02:27:04.829
Can you?

1196
02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:15.364
I need some sleep.

1197
02:27:19.527 --> 02:27:20.895
I need you.

1198
02:27:49.239 --> 02:27:50.903
Psst. Are you ready?

1199
02:27:51.758 --> 02:27:54.798
Will you speak your line,
sister Isis?

1200
02:27:57.008 --> 02:28:01.086
Long have I wandered
in the land of men...

1201
02:28:01.662 --> 02:28:05.195
...in search of you, brother Osiris.

1202
02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:16.750
I have been killed
and cut into bits.

1203
02:28:18.659 --> 02:28:22.211
You put my pieces together...

1204
02:28:22.617 --> 02:28:24.547
...bringing back life...

1205
02:28:25.393 --> 02:28:26.648
...with a kiss.

1206
02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:30.604
There goes our blood.

1207
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.800
It doesn't matter.
It's only a show.

1208
02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:52.737
- I can't get it right.
- No, Caesar, not like that.

1209
02:28:57.783 --> 02:28:58.924
Hello, precious.

1210
02:29:03.696 --> 02:29:05.479
Have you been a good girl?

1211
02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:15.729
Don't you think she looks
beautiful in my costume?

1212
02:29:16.144 --> 02:29:18.182
- She's even wearing my little boots.
- She's just like her father.

1213
02:29:18.221 --> 02:29:19.221
My little...

1214
02:29:20.885 --> 02:29:21.894
...boots.

1215
02:29:44.449 --> 02:29:45.844
So serious.

1216
02:29:52.368 --> 02:29:56.906
I wanted to dress like you today.
I think it will be fun. ((?*)

1217
02:30:24.922 --> 02:30:26.085
Password?

1218
02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:28.898
Scrotum.

1219
02:30:29.023 --> 02:30:30.617
So be it.

1220
02:31:14.225 --> 02:31:15.271
I...

1221
02:31:16.253 --> 02:31:17.381
...live...

1222
02:31:19.127 --> 02:31:20.467
...live.

1223
02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:23.021
Hail, Claudius Caesar!

1224
02:32:23.388 --> 02:32:26.172
- Hail, Claudius Caesar!
- Hail, Claudius!

1225
02:32:26.272 --> 02:32:30.260
- Hail, Claudius!
- Claudius, hail.

1226
02:32:32.526 --> 02:32:35.451
Hail, Claudius Caesar!

1227
02:32:36.103 --> 02:32:38.103
Hail!
