1
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.583
Ninety-one, 92...

2
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.250
- It's down there.
- Where? If they catch us--

3
00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:46.417
There's a million bottles
of booze in there.

4
00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.125
You think they're gonna miss one?

5
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.458
Weather is with us, sir.

6
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:09.000
We arrive in port in a couple of hours.

7
00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.792
Very good.

8
00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.750
You're welcome, sir.

9
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:21.750
Man, I never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

10
00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:25.167
Oh, what, your shit smells like roses?

11
00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:26.667
Hey, look.

12
00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:29.667
I'll give you a hand.

13
00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:39.333
- Thought you said it was booze.
- That's what the papers said.

14
00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:46.500
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level. Look.

15
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.292
- Which section?
- 101.

16
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.458
Fuck. Take the wheel.

17
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.042
- Yes, sir.
- Fuck.

18
00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:56.333
Close the door! Get the masks.

19
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.667
Holy shit.

20
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.333
Take care of them.

21
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.500
- Morning.
- Passport, please.

22
00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:01.167
Rough seas?

23
00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.000
The sea was smooth. The party was
a bit rough, if you know what I mean.

24
00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:06.750
- Ibiza.
- Yeah.

25
00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:08.375
Thanks.

26
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.792
When I was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.

27
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.209
Never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.

28
00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:29.792
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

29
00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:55.917
Security check.

30
00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:57.917
Do I look like a security risk?

31
00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:01.250
Please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.

32
00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:03.667
My documents are right here, sir.

33
00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:06.000
The computer is in the office.

34
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.750
Her too.

35
00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:10.625
She's sleeping.

36
00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:13.584
- With her documents.
- Okay, sure.

37
00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:29.625
You're gonna lose it.

38
00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.834
Close, inspector, you're close.

39
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.625
That's a big one. Go left, go left.

40
00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:47.000
Don't let him get away.

41
00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:52.917
You're close.

42
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.792
Go left, go left! Go right!

43
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.667
Must be Moby Dick you hooked.
Need some help?

44
00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:06.959
No, thank you, Frank.

45
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.500
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

46
00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:20.292
You were close, inspector.
You were close.

47
00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:27.500
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

48
00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:31.250
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

49
00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:34.584
- Jerry Lewis is a genius.
- Dean was the genius.

50
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.834
No, Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

51
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
My point exactly.
Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

52
00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.459
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

53
00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:59.167
I am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.

54
00:06:59.334 --> 00:07:00.834
There is a mess in Marseilles.

55
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.917
Some madman driving an Audi
at impossible speeds.

56
00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.375
Don't look at me.

57
00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:11.459
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

58
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:15.834
But I will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.

59
00:07:17.334 --> 00:07:19.209
As usual.

60
00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:26.125
Tarconi!

61
00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:28.917
- Please!
- I am sorry, Frank.

62
00:07:29.084 --> 00:07:32.209
- It's our first bite!
- Yeah, yeah.

63
00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:34.834
- Please.
- Yeah.

64
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.500
Stop the boat. Come on.

65
00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:39.417
- No. No, Frank.
- Come on, please.

66
00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:23.167
Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson?

67
00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:24.959
Business.

68
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.750
What kind of business?

69
00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:29.167
Environmental protection.

70
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.167
Thank you.

71
00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:42.834
Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening
address at an EU conference...

72
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.750
...on environmental impact of industry
in Odessa tomorrow.

73
00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:48.667
- What is top on your list of priorities?
- It's a short list.

74
00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:51.625
There's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.

75
00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:53.625
In the face of increasing pressure...

76
00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:56.750
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

77
00:08:56.917 --> 00:09:00.292
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

78
00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:03.459
Well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

79
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:05.334
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...

80
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.750
...I have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.

81
00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:14.667
- Your speech for tomorrow.
- Any good?

82
00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:19.042
- It's going to piss off a lot of people.
- Excellent.

83
00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.167
Hello?

84
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.125
Mr. Minister?

85
00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:48.167
Who is this?

86
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.834
My name is not important.

87
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.292
I've been put in charge of
the negotiations...

88
00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.875
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

89
00:09:56.042 --> 00:09:59.334
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

90
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.000
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is.

91
00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.292
I've terminated negotiations permanently.

92
00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:06.875
I think you will reconsider
that position...

93
00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:10.500
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

94
00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:27.334
I'll be in touch.

95
00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:10.917
Yeah, there's been an accident.

96
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:14.626
Send an ambulance,
8 Route de la Falaise.

97
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:34.417
Malcolm.

98
00:11:34.584 --> 00:11:36.292
Malcolm. Malcolm.

99
00:11:42.376 --> 00:11:44.834
I asked you for your price.
What is this?

100
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:49.126
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

101
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.501
My boss said you're the man for the job.

102
00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:53.334
Your boss got his facts wrong.

103
00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:57.751
Two things you should know about my boss:

104
00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:01.167
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

105
00:12:01.334 --> 00:12:03.417
Well, there's a first time for everything.

106
00:12:12.001 --> 00:12:15.126
Well, not this time.

107
00:12:21.334 --> 00:12:23.417
You don't wanna do this.

108
00:12:23.584 --> 00:12:27.542
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

109
00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:30.709
You have 10 seconds to change your mind.

110
00:12:35.084 --> 00:12:38.501
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

111
00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:40.417
Malcolm. Malcolm.

112
00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:41.626
You hear me?

113
00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:46.626
Mal, I said drop in anytime,
but I didn't mean...

114
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.667
- Nowhere else to go.
- Just take it easy, okay?

115
00:13:51.334 --> 00:13:52.626
Don't move me from the car.

116
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:56.792
- It's just till the ambulance arrives.
- No ambulance.

117
00:13:57.626 --> 00:14:00.584
You need a doctor, you've been shot.
I can't take care of this.

118
00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:04.959
Not far from car.

119
00:14:06.417 --> 00:14:07.501
Relax.

120
00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:12.501
Just try to stay calm.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

121
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:25.542
He's inside. Quick, it's serious.

122
00:14:30.084 --> 00:14:31.126
Sir?

123
00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:34.501
- You wanna be careful moving him.
- We know our job, okay?

124
00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:37.209
Sir, can you hear me?

125
00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.959
This car... No...

126
00:14:39.126 --> 00:14:40.667
If you hear me, press my hand.

127
00:14:41.084 --> 00:14:42.417
The car...

128
00:15:32.501 --> 00:15:34.501
Am I in heaven?

129
00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:37.167
Actually, you're in a bit of the shit.

130
00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:40.334
You'll help me out of it?

131
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:42.792
That depends on how deep you're in.

132
00:15:43.126 --> 00:15:46.292
- Don't trust anyone.
- Couldn't agree with you more.

133
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:50.084
- Come on.
- No! Don't leave the car!

134
00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:53.459
- What's so special about the car?
- Not the car.

135
00:16:05.584 --> 00:16:07.417
Wait!

136
00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:37.167
I told you.

137
00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:44.084
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>

138
00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:47.167
<i>I told you.</i>

139
00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:41.793
I took the liberty of bringing your suit.

140
00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:44.168
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

141
00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:47.001
Correct. But I'm not working.

142
00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:50.668
- You see, boss? I told you.
- Please, Joseph.

143
00:17:51.334 --> 00:17:55.334
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

144
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:57.084
Thank you.

145
00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:58.751
As I was saying...

146
00:17:58.918 --> 00:18:02.084
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

147
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:04.709
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

148
00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:06.459
He proved to be ineffective.

149
00:18:06.626 --> 00:18:09.918
And now I am left with unfinished business.

150
00:18:10.084 --> 00:18:12.418
The way I see it, you're responsible.

151
00:18:12.876 --> 00:18:14.959
I understand your point of view.

152
00:18:15.126 --> 00:18:16.334
But I'm still unavailable.

153
00:18:18.334 --> 00:18:19.834
Boss, can I say something?

154
00:18:22.626 --> 00:18:24.876
Anyone else wanna say something?

155
00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:29.543
Good.

156
00:18:29.793 --> 00:18:31.834
Find me a smarter one.

157
00:18:34.168 --> 00:18:36.209
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

158
00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:39.168
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.

159
00:18:39.793 --> 00:18:41.376
One.

160
00:18:43.626 --> 00:18:44.668
Two.

161
00:18:47.834 --> 00:18:48.959
One condition.

162
00:18:52.043 --> 00:18:53.584
I'm listening.

163
00:18:54.251 --> 00:18:56.501
I drive my own car.

164
00:18:57.751 --> 00:18:59.251
Deal.

165
00:19:02.501 --> 00:19:05.959
In anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.

166
00:19:06.126 --> 00:19:10.084
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

167
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:13.834
Left the switch-over license plates.
Love that.

168
00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:16.293
Replaced the GPS with one of our own.

169
00:19:16.459 --> 00:19:18.334
Preprogrammed.
More efficient that way.

170
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:22.793
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

171
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:27.959
We're playing in a much larger game here.

172
00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:32.834
Don't think of this as just another job.
Think of it as a mission.

173
00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:37.668
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

174
00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:39.959
I make a deal, that's the deal.
Just like you.

175
00:19:40.126 --> 00:19:42.876
You don't like names. Neither do I.
We're both precise.

176
00:19:43.043 --> 00:19:46.168
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

177
00:19:46.334 --> 00:19:50.334
...beyond what we are paid to do.
Those are your rules, right?

178
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:00.168
You forgot one.

179
00:20:00.709 --> 00:20:03.668
- I work alone.
- I thought you might like the company.

180
00:20:04.084 --> 00:20:06.418
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

181
00:20:08.626 --> 00:20:10.459
You're right. I do.

182
00:20:13.168 --> 00:20:14.418
Wait.

183
00:20:16.293 --> 00:20:18.251
What, you wanna change the rules?

184
00:20:19.834 --> 00:20:22.626
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

185
00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:27.001
You're the boss.

186
00:20:29.751 --> 00:20:31.793
Anything else?

187
00:20:32.418 --> 00:20:34.251
The jewelry.
Anything I should know?

188
00:20:37.876 --> 00:20:40.543
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

189
00:20:40.709 --> 00:20:43.584
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

190
00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:45.668
Same principle, just refined.

191
00:20:45.834 --> 00:20:47.584
Twenty-five feet from the car...

192
00:20:47.751 --> 00:20:51.168
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

193
00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.168
Fifty feet, orange.

194
00:20:53.959 --> 00:20:55.709
Second liquid flows into the chamber.

195
00:20:55.876 --> 00:20:58.876
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

196
00:21:04.084 --> 00:21:05.876
Time to go.

197
00:21:06.334 --> 00:21:10.084
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.

198
00:21:11.126 --> 00:21:15.001
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

199
00:21:16.084 --> 00:21:19.084
Money for gas and food.

200
00:21:19.251 --> 00:21:20.501
Any other questions?

201
00:21:52.043 --> 00:21:54.251
Would you mind buckling your seat belt?

202
00:22:05.126 --> 00:22:08.334
Don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

203
00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:16.001
Great.

204
00:22:31.668 --> 00:22:34.293
<i>Ocean Pearl
requesting cargo clearance.</i>

205
00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:38.501
The papers are with
the environmental agency.

206
00:22:38.834 --> 00:22:40.793
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

207
00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:43.626
<i>- We'll inform you when they're signed.
- Okay.</i>

208
00:22:53.168 --> 00:22:54.876
I know what happened to you.

209
00:22:55.043 --> 00:22:57.334
But what happened to Frank?

210
00:23:03.001 --> 00:23:07.168
Colonel Medved over at Intelligence
has been given all the information.

211
00:23:07.793 --> 00:23:09.168
He knows it's top priority.

212
00:23:09.334 --> 00:23:11.918
He wants you to know
he has his best men on it.

213
00:23:12.084 --> 00:23:14.293
He'll keep it out of official channels.

214
00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:18.168
He suggests you buy
as much time as you can.

215
00:24:13.501 --> 00:24:18.251
Look, I don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

216
00:24:18.418 --> 00:24:20.751
You were here first,
you know more than I do...

217
00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:22.668
...download me on what you know.

218
00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:24.418
I know nothing.

219
00:24:24.584 --> 00:24:26.834
How did you know Malcolm?

220
00:24:27.209 --> 00:24:28.251
I didn't.

221
00:24:28.793 --> 00:24:31.668
You just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?

222
00:24:33.835 --> 00:24:35.960
I'm now in a car with man I don't know.

223
00:24:37.793 --> 00:24:40.460
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

224
00:24:46.793 --> 00:24:48.293
<i>Nice to hear from you.</i>

225
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.543
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

226
00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:53.501
<i>1-1-2-6.</i>

227
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.168
<i>Call me when you arrive.</i>

228
00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:04.335
What's in Budapest?

229
00:25:04.501 --> 00:25:06.793
Goulash. Beer.

230
00:25:13.751 --> 00:25:15.001
All right.

231
00:25:15.168 --> 00:25:18.001
Let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.

232
00:25:18.626 --> 00:25:21.168
What happened to the rule of no names?

233
00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:24.460
I'm suspending that rule for the moment.

234
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:29.710
I'm Frank Martin.

235
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:33.460
And your name is?

236
00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:39.001
What matters, my name?

237
00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:42.501
Well, we're in this situation together.

238
00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:44.626
No.

239
00:25:47.251 --> 00:25:51.001
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

240
00:25:52.168 --> 00:25:54.126
I'd call that being in the same situation.

241
00:25:54.543 --> 00:25:57.168
It's not. They are going to kill you.

242
00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:01.168
I'm aware of that.

243
00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:05.126
In all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.

244
00:26:05.293 --> 00:26:08.835
Now, if I'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

245
00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:11.668
From the top. We have this problem.

246
00:26:11.835 --> 00:26:13.835
You think I don't know it's a problem?

247
00:26:14.293 --> 00:26:16.168
I look stupid to you?

248
00:26:16.835 --> 00:26:19.376
I didn't say you were stupid.

249
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:22.501
But we have a problem...

250
00:26:22.668 --> 00:26:26.335
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

251
00:26:28.001 --> 00:26:30.293
I don't want to talk anymore.

252
00:26:37.626 --> 00:26:38.918
Fine.

253
00:26:52.251 --> 00:26:54.001
What did you say your name was?

254
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.960
Frank. Frank Martin.

255
00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:01.085
Frank Martin.

256
00:27:01.418 --> 00:27:03.501
Valentina.

257
00:27:06.501 --> 00:27:09.043
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.168
<i>The gentlemen
from Ecocorp are here.</i>

259
00:28:08.585 --> 00:28:09.793
Show them in.

260
00:28:17.543 --> 00:28:18.585
Gentlemen.

261
00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:23.376
Mr. Minister.

262
00:28:23.543 --> 00:28:26.460
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

263
00:28:26.626 --> 00:28:29.585
- ...on such short notice.
- You make it very hard not to.

264
00:28:29.751 --> 00:28:33.418
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

265
00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:35.835
Here are the contracts.

266
00:28:37.668 --> 00:28:38.751
All in order.

267
00:28:39.543 --> 00:28:41.626
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

268
00:28:41.793 --> 00:28:43.835
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

269
00:28:44.001 --> 00:28:45.335
Ships?

270
00:28:45.876 --> 00:28:47.335
I thought there was only one.

271
00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:50.001
Oh, well, here's the thing.

272
00:28:50.168 --> 00:28:52.960
In order to make the venture
more profitable...

273
00:28:53.126 --> 00:28:56.126
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

274
00:28:56.293 --> 00:28:57.960
How many ships are we talking about?

275
00:28:58.126 --> 00:29:01.918
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

276
00:29:02.501 --> 00:29:03.751
Eight.

277
00:29:04.085 --> 00:29:05.293
This year.

278
00:29:06.501 --> 00:29:09.585
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

279
00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:11.793
You've said so yourself, haven't you?

280
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.501
And I will do again tomorrow in Odessa...

281
00:29:14.668 --> 00:29:17.585
...where I will sign these.

282
00:29:18.501 --> 00:29:21.335
We were really hoping to settle this today.

283
00:29:21.501 --> 00:29:25.876
I want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.

284
00:29:26.043 --> 00:29:28.251
Twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...

285
00:29:28.418 --> 00:29:30.835
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

286
00:29:31.543 --> 00:29:34.293
No, of course not.

287
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.501
Then I will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

288
00:29:44.335 --> 00:29:45.751
<i>Yes.</i>

289
00:29:45.918 --> 00:29:47.668
Okay, I'll stay.

290
00:29:47.835 --> 00:29:49.501
<i>- But the material is leaking.
- And?</i>

291
00:29:49.668 --> 00:29:52.293
<i>- We won't be able to hide it.
- I'll take care of it.</i>

292
00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.793
If ever they check...

293
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.293
<i>Easy. The deal will be closed
very soon.</i>

294
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.126
Twenty-four hours. No more.

295
00:30:07.168 --> 00:30:11.001
- Yes?
- I've bought you another 24 hours.

296
00:30:11.168 --> 00:30:13.501
You have until tomorrow, 9 a.m.

297
00:30:13.668 --> 00:30:15.501
That should be more than enough time.

298
00:30:16.085 --> 00:30:17.960
<i>Do you have a lead?</i>

299
00:30:18.126 --> 00:30:19.960
Better than a lead.

300
00:30:20.751 --> 00:30:21.793
A location.

301
00:31:00.293 --> 00:31:02.293
I'm hungry.

302
00:31:03.293 --> 00:31:05.835
We're 100 kilometers from beer and sausage.

303
00:31:07.251 --> 00:31:09.668
I don't like sausage.

304
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.418
What would you like?

305
00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.210
Veal.

306
00:31:20.376 --> 00:31:22.335
Roast, with carrots...

307
00:31:22.501 --> 00:31:23.960
...and beets.

308
00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:28.585
In gravy, with Madeira in stock.

309
00:31:28.752 --> 00:31:30.043
Nothing to start?

310
00:31:33.585 --> 00:31:35.585
A salad.

311
00:31:36.168 --> 00:31:39.460
Greens tossed with balsamic.

312
00:31:39.627 --> 00:31:41.418
From Modena.

313
00:31:41.585 --> 00:31:43.002
Aged?

314
00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:45.168
Of course, aged.

315
00:31:48.168 --> 00:31:50.210
And for dessert?

316
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.085
Sachertorte.

317
00:31:53.585 --> 00:31:56.127
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.835
With.

319
00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:01.460
To drink?

320
00:32:03.335 --> 00:32:04.585
Wine.

321
00:32:04.752 --> 00:32:06.585
Tokaj, perhaps?

322
00:32:07.085 --> 00:32:08.168
Ice wine.

323
00:32:09.335 --> 00:32:11.168
Of course.

324
00:32:23.002 --> 00:32:25.835
- What are you doing?
- Seeing a man about some jewelry.

325
00:32:37.502 --> 00:32:39.085
He's gone off the reservation.

326
00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:44.752
Send someone to get him back on.

327
00:32:45.377 --> 00:32:47.335
Don't kill him.

328
00:33:14.002 --> 00:33:16.668
<i>Frank. It's so good to see you,
mein Freund.</i>

329
00:33:16.918 --> 00:33:19.252
Good to see you too, Otto.

330
00:33:19.585 --> 00:33:22.127
You didn't mention you bring company.

331
00:33:22.627 --> 00:33:23.793
It's not really company.

332
00:33:24.293 --> 00:33:25.960
It's...

333
00:33:27.127 --> 00:33:28.252
...complicated.

334
00:33:28.418 --> 00:33:31.418
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

335
00:33:31.585 --> 00:33:35.335
<i>...over a nice schnitzel
with Kartoffelsalat I have prepared.</i>

336
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.168
Hey, Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel...

337
00:33:38.335 --> 00:33:40.793
...but we need to get rid of this first.

338
00:33:43.293 --> 00:33:46.793
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

339
00:33:47.252 --> 00:33:48.502
English, please, Otto.

340
00:33:49.918 --> 00:33:51.960
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

341
00:33:52.127 --> 00:33:55.252
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

342
00:33:55.418 --> 00:33:58.793
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...

343
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.627
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

344
00:34:01.793 --> 00:34:03.835
Very hush-hush stuff.

345
00:34:05.502 --> 00:34:08.418
I didn't realize you were in the loop
on the Pentagon hush-hush.

346
00:34:08.585 --> 00:34:10.668
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

347
00:34:10.835 --> 00:34:13.002
...walking through the Internet.

348
00:34:13.168 --> 00:34:15.460
You wanna see the invasion plans for Iran?

349
00:34:15.877 --> 00:34:17.668
Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:17.835 --> 00:34:21.293
Right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to Iran.

351
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.918
I don't wanna bother you
with the details...

352
00:34:24.085 --> 00:34:28.668
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.

353
00:34:34.835 --> 00:34:36.335
You should not be doing this.

354
00:34:36.502 --> 00:34:38.502
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

355
00:34:38.668 --> 00:34:41.168
Not advice. A warning.

356
00:34:41.752 --> 00:34:43.293
Well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?

357
00:34:50.335 --> 00:34:51.502
I agree with you.

358
00:34:56.085 --> 00:34:57.668
You're off course.

359
00:35:03.752 --> 00:35:06.377
- Should I?
- Yeah, you should.

360
00:35:12.335 --> 00:35:13.960
Look, fellas...

361
00:35:14.752 --> 00:35:17.668
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.

362
00:35:19.085 --> 00:35:21.418
In my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.

363
00:35:21.585 --> 00:35:24.835
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

364
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.335
The boss says, "Back on the road."

365
00:35:29.793 --> 00:35:31.168
Frank?

366
00:35:31.918 --> 00:35:32.960
Keep at it.

367
00:35:35.668 --> 00:35:36.835
Back in the car, Frank.

368
00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:38.710
No.

369
00:36:50.002 --> 00:36:52.127
- Find it?
- Not yet.

370
00:38:08.752 --> 00:38:10.377
You're the smart one?

371
00:38:10.543 --> 00:38:13.168
No. I'm the big one.

372
00:39:05.294 --> 00:39:06.627
Not so big anymore, are you?

373
00:39:29.169 --> 00:39:31.002
Found it.

374
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.752
- The transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

375
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.252
It's wired.

376
00:39:41.752 --> 00:39:43.585
If I do:

377
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.502
You fight good.

378
00:40:46.502 --> 00:40:48.669
But you tie bad.

379
00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:55.294
Where are you going?

380
00:40:55.794 --> 00:40:57.585
Tired.

381
00:40:58.752 --> 00:41:01.002
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

382
00:41:01.835 --> 00:41:03.502
That makes two of us.

383
00:41:04.002 --> 00:41:07.002
What do you want me to do
when they--? When they wake up?

384
00:41:07.169 --> 00:41:10.294
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

385
00:41:28.585 --> 00:41:29.752
I'm not amused.

386
00:41:29.919 --> 00:41:31.835
You'd be less amused if you ended up dead.

387
00:41:32.002 --> 00:41:34.419
<i>If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
You need me.</i>

388
00:41:34.585 --> 00:41:37.419
You want me to complete the job,
I need some clarification.

389
00:41:39.002 --> 00:41:40.169
I'm listening.

390
00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:41.752
In person.

391
00:41:41.919 --> 00:41:43.377
We've already done in person.

392
00:41:43.544 --> 00:41:45.669
<i>Well, not to my satisfaction,
apparently.</i>

393
00:41:46.377 --> 00:41:49.335
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

394
00:41:50.377 --> 00:41:52.960
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

395
00:42:49.752 --> 00:42:50.835
Hello?

396
00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:53.002
You've disappointed me.

397
00:42:53.169 --> 00:42:56.252
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

398
00:42:56.419 --> 00:43:01.210
- I told you I wanted to do this in person.
- That won't be necessary. You see...

399
00:43:01.377 --> 00:43:03.502
...since our little chat
at the beginning...

400
00:43:03.669 --> 00:43:07.169
...I've been thinking I don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

401
00:43:07.335 --> 00:43:09.544
Any idiot with a driver's license will do.

402
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.794
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

403
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.335
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

404
00:44:02.585 --> 00:44:03.669
Who are you?

405
00:44:04.002 --> 00:44:06.669
- Your new chauffeur.
- I want the old one back.

406
00:44:06.835 --> 00:44:09.169
He's about to go to pieces.

407
00:45:17.544 --> 00:45:18.919
You're fired.

408
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.794
How was your nap?

409
00:45:24.127 --> 00:45:26.544
Restful. How was your phone call?

410
00:45:26.711 --> 00:45:29.211
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

411
00:45:41.086 --> 00:45:42.127
Tarconi.

412
00:45:42.294 --> 00:45:43.336
It's me.

413
00:45:44.502 --> 00:45:46.252
I was wondering when you would call.

414
00:45:46.419 --> 00:45:47.669
I've been busy.

415
00:45:47.836 --> 00:45:50.502
Let me guess. In Budapest?

416
00:45:51.711 --> 00:45:53.086
You've been busy too.

417
00:45:53.544 --> 00:45:56.419
Never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.

418
00:45:56.586 --> 00:45:59.461
So I don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.

419
00:45:59.627 --> 00:46:02.086
There is a black Mercedes also in Budapest.

420
00:46:02.252 --> 00:46:04.336
<i>Probably not occupied
by friends of yours.</i>

421
00:46:04.502 --> 00:46:07.169
That is what I know.
Now tell me what you know.

422
00:46:07.961 --> 00:46:11.336
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

423
00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.419
Russian, I think.

424
00:46:13.627 --> 00:46:15.836
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

425
00:46:16.002 --> 00:46:18.002
Have you tried asking her?

426
00:46:18.169 --> 00:46:20.252
<i>- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Sorry.</i>

427
00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:22.169
Of course you've asked.
And she says?

428
00:46:22.752 --> 00:46:24.086
I'm going to die.

429
00:46:24.252 --> 00:46:26.586
Typical. Russians.

430
00:46:26.752 --> 00:46:29.002
They are so dark.

431
00:46:29.169 --> 00:46:32.669
I remember, in school,
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking...

432
00:46:32.836 --> 00:46:35.544
...when do these people laugh?

433
00:46:35.711 --> 00:46:37.419
One page after the other...

434
00:46:37.586 --> 00:46:40.586
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, Frank.

435
00:46:40.752 --> 00:46:44.169
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

436
00:46:44.336 --> 00:46:45.586
Is that code?

437
00:46:46.502 --> 00:46:49.961
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

438
00:46:50.127 --> 00:46:52.377
Wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.

439
00:46:52.544 --> 00:46:53.586
<i>They?</i>

440
00:46:54.252 --> 00:46:55.336
Some American.

441
00:46:55.502 --> 00:46:58.377
<i>Can you be more specific?
A name? A number?</i>

442
00:46:58.544 --> 00:46:59.627
Nothing.

443
00:46:59.794 --> 00:47:02.002
Why do you always make it so easy, Frank?

444
00:47:02.169 --> 00:47:03.919
It's my nature.

445
00:47:04.086 --> 00:47:05.961
<i>Where are you? I will come there.</i>

446
00:47:06.127 --> 00:47:08.627
That's not a good idea.
They have me on a short leash.

447
00:47:08.794 --> 00:47:11.669
I can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.

448
00:47:13.252 --> 00:47:15.419
How close are you to a computer?

449
00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:20.336
Yes, Frank?

450
00:47:20.502 --> 00:47:23.336
<i>That wasn't very nice,
back there in the market.</i>

451
00:47:23.502 --> 00:47:26.336
You were the one
who broke the rules, not me.

452
00:47:26.502 --> 00:47:28.627
<i>Point well taken.</i>

453
00:47:28.836 --> 00:47:32.419
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

454
00:47:32.586 --> 00:47:35.752
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

455
00:47:36.336 --> 00:47:37.461
<i>More or less.</i>

456
00:47:37.627 --> 00:47:40.544
You have what I need
to get the bracelet off...

457
00:47:40.711 --> 00:47:43.586
...I have the packages
you need delivered.

458
00:47:44.586 --> 00:47:47.169
Here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-12.

459
00:47:47.502 --> 00:47:49.002
<i>That'll take you to the place...</i>

460
00:47:49.169 --> 00:47:51.502
<i>...where we can have a
conclusion to this business.</i>

461
00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:53.461
I look forward to it.

462
00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:00.752
Frank.

463
00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:02.169
<i>Did you get it?</i>

464
00:48:07.127 --> 00:48:09.086
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

465
00:48:09.252 --> 00:48:11.502
<i>...and we should have his number
and location.</i>

466
00:48:12.836 --> 00:48:14.627
Your new phone, sir.

467
00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:23.461
- Anything else?
- No.

468
00:48:26.919 --> 00:48:30.669
<i>Frank, do you know where
the signal is taking you?</i>

469
00:48:41.002 --> 00:48:45.169
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

470
00:48:45.336 --> 00:48:48.502
Roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.

471
00:48:48.669 --> 00:48:51.294
Romanian wine, not so good.

472
00:48:52.836 --> 00:48:55.711
But for the last meal,
could be worse.

473
00:48:58.169 --> 00:49:01.502
You really should begin
to think more positive.

474
00:49:01.669 --> 00:49:04.044
I'm realist.

475
00:49:05.961 --> 00:49:08.669
My friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.

476
00:49:08.836 --> 00:49:11.711
What means "doom and gloom"?

477
00:49:11.877 --> 00:49:14.836
You know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.

478
00:49:15.002 --> 00:49:18.002
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

479
00:49:18.211 --> 00:49:21.502
He was talking about you in general.
Russians, as a people.

480
00:49:21.669 --> 00:49:23.836
I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian.

481
00:49:24.502 --> 00:49:25.627
Excuse me.

482
00:49:25.794 --> 00:49:29.877
Not excused. We're different people.
We're different here...

483
00:49:30.044 --> 00:49:31.252
...and here.

484
00:49:36.877 --> 00:49:40.919
Me, personally, I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

485
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:44.877
How you can make such a statement?
You don't know me.

486
00:49:46.836 --> 00:49:49.211
Well, I see you're putting makeup on.

487
00:49:49.377 --> 00:49:52.919
If you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?

488
00:49:55.419 --> 00:49:58.877
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

489
00:50:05.627 --> 00:50:07.752
Hello.

490
00:50:08.711 --> 00:50:09.919
What's that?

491
00:50:10.086 --> 00:50:12.586
Souvenirs from Ibiza.
Do you want one?

492
00:50:12.836 --> 00:50:15.919
No, thank you. And neither do you.
We need to stay sharp.

493
00:50:17.961 --> 00:50:19.669
Okay.

494
00:50:24.752 --> 00:50:26.294
You stay sharp.

495
00:50:26.461 --> 00:50:29.336
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

496
00:50:29.794 --> 00:50:33.169
Give me that.
Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

497
00:50:36.461 --> 00:50:37.752
Give me that--

498
00:50:42.836 --> 00:50:45.002
Jesus.

499
00:50:47.419 --> 00:50:49.086
Great.

500
00:50:51.169 --> 00:50:54.461
- Just great.
- Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

501
00:50:54.627 --> 00:50:56.502
I should?
How about when those pills hit?

502
00:50:56.669 --> 00:50:59.336
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

503
00:50:59.502 --> 00:51:00.627
That would be nice.

504
00:51:01.169 --> 00:51:03.669
Boring. Boring. Boring?

505
00:51:03.836 --> 00:51:05.794
Oh, yeah.

506
00:51:44.002 --> 00:51:45.794
You should stay in the car.

507
00:51:46.086 --> 00:51:48.461
You want me to pee in car?

508
00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:55.919
Okay. Go on.

509
00:51:59.794 --> 00:52:01.169
You remember.

510
00:52:27.336 --> 00:52:29.169
Don't.

511
00:52:50.836 --> 00:52:51.919
Don't.

512
00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:54.378
<i>Don't.</i>

513
00:53:15.003 --> 00:53:16.003
Oh, no.

514
00:53:54.169 --> 00:53:57.669
- Stop, all right?
- Why? I don't drive.

515
00:53:58.086 --> 00:53:59.128
I want to have fun.

516
00:53:59.294 --> 00:54:02.669
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

517
00:54:02.961 --> 00:54:06.003
It's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?

518
00:54:06.169 --> 00:54:09.419
- Drink with me, Frankie.
- I don't want a drink.

519
00:54:12.169 --> 00:54:14.669
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

520
00:54:14.836 --> 00:54:16.836
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

521
00:54:17.836 --> 00:54:20.003
Come on, get in the car.

522
00:54:21.044 --> 00:54:23.169
I am free, like a bird.

523
00:54:31.128 --> 00:54:32.919
The girl! Come on! Faster!

524
00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:44.294
- I have lost my friend!
- I'll buy you a new one.

525
00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:00.669
Have any idea why we have a car on our ass?

526
00:55:01.961 --> 00:55:03.336
I don't know. I don't care.

527
00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:08.086
- You mind?
- First you say I'm doom and gloom...

528
00:55:08.253 --> 00:55:11.128
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

529
00:56:00.753 --> 00:56:03.211
- Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement.

530
00:56:03.378 --> 00:56:04.669
We do.

531
00:56:04.836 --> 00:56:06.753
It had nothing to do with a car on my ass.

532
00:56:08.336 --> 00:56:12.836
I don't have anything to do with that.
Someone else has issues with you?

533
00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:14.836
Likely.

534
00:56:17.544 --> 00:56:20.919
What I think is that there are
other forces at work here.

535
00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:23.503
Let me check into it,
see what I can find out.

536
00:56:23.669 --> 00:56:25.336
What do I do in the meantime?

537
00:56:25.503 --> 00:56:27.669
Drive faster.

538
00:57:02.086 --> 00:57:03.419
What the hell is he doing?

539
00:58:06.336 --> 00:58:08.169
There!

540
00:58:08.336 --> 00:58:09.753
He's down there!

541
00:58:15.294 --> 00:58:16.628
I'm hungry.

542
00:58:16.794 --> 00:58:19.003
Should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.

543
00:58:21.211 --> 00:58:22.294
Look!

544
00:58:28.669 --> 00:58:30.836
I wasn't hungry then, I was thirsty.

545
00:58:31.003 --> 00:58:32.669
Why you are so mean to me?

546
00:58:34.003 --> 00:58:37.169
- I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
- What means "preoccupied"?

547
00:58:42.836 --> 00:58:44.419
That means preoccupied.

548
00:58:56.128 --> 00:58:58.128
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

549
00:58:59.919 --> 00:59:02.503
- Get down!
- Shoot him!

550
00:59:13.169 --> 00:59:14.503
Bloody hell!

551
00:59:24.503 --> 00:59:25.795
Faster!

552
00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:33.836
Stop the car!

553
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:35.961
Oh, shit!

554
01:00:40.836 --> 01:00:42.295
What are you doing?

555
01:00:42.503 --> 01:00:43.961
You're so tense.

556
01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:46.378
You don't say.

557
01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.628
I make you relax, okay?

558
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.795
- Yeah.
- I'm good at this.

559
01:00:57.211 --> 01:00:59.503
Making tense go away.

560
01:01:08.461 --> 01:01:09.670
What are you doing?

561
01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:14.628
I want to feel sex
one more time before I die.

562
01:01:14.795 --> 01:01:16.295
Don't you?

563
01:01:18.503 --> 01:01:21.003
What is it with you and dying?

564
01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:25.086
There is something wrong with me?

565
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:26.961
Am I not sexy?

566
01:01:28.295 --> 01:01:29.461
Yeah, you're sexy.

567
01:01:35.461 --> 01:01:36.503
You're the gay.

568
01:01:37.753 --> 01:01:41.003
Nope, I am not the gay.

569
01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.128
I don't mind.

570
01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:46.670
I'm not, okay?

571
01:01:49.086 --> 01:01:51.753
Then what's the problem?

572
01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:57.670
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'm not in the mood?

573
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.503
- I thought rule is don't open package.
- It is.

574
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:20.378
Why you have rules if you break them?

575
01:02:21.628 --> 01:02:23.336
I keep asking myself the same thing.

576
01:02:24.795 --> 01:02:26.836
Phone books.

577
01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:37.628
- You're the package.
- Yes.

578
01:02:38.628 --> 01:02:40.003
Could have said something.

579
01:02:40.503 --> 01:02:43.170
- Would it make a difference?
- Yes.

580
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:46.586
Now what are you doing?

581
01:02:46.753 --> 01:02:49.211
You know, back in garage...

582
01:02:49.378 --> 01:02:54.295
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

583
01:02:54.461 --> 01:02:57.170
I was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.

584
01:02:57.336 --> 01:02:58.795
I don't see the turn-on in that.

585
01:02:58.961 --> 01:03:04.045
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

586
01:03:04.211 --> 01:03:06.295
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

587
01:03:06.461 --> 01:03:09.461
Would you striptease for me again?

588
01:03:10.128 --> 01:03:12.795
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

589
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:14.128
You want keys?

590
01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.961
I want you to stop playing around,
is what I want.

591
01:03:21.128 --> 01:03:24.420
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

592
01:03:24.586 --> 01:03:27.128
This is not the time
or the place for playing.

593
01:03:27.295 --> 01:03:31.378
Why do I get feeling with you
it's never time or place?

594
01:03:31.545 --> 01:03:33.878
If I wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

595
01:03:34.045 --> 01:03:36.336
Now, give me the keys.

596
01:03:36.836 --> 01:03:39.170
Come on, Frank Martin.

597
01:03:39.336 --> 01:03:41.628
Make playtime for me.

598
01:04:01.628 --> 01:04:04.170
All right? That enough?

599
01:04:04.336 --> 01:04:07.128
Not enough.
That is not a striptease, Frank.

600
01:04:07.295 --> 01:04:10.836
Striptease is sexy.
You know, move your ass a little.

601
01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:13.170
Come on, Frank Martin.

602
01:04:13.461 --> 01:04:15.378
You want keys?

603
01:04:15.753 --> 01:04:18.586
I want strip.

604
01:04:24.753 --> 01:04:27.378
You know what I'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?

605
01:04:27.545 --> 01:04:29.003
Spank me?

606
01:04:29.545 --> 01:04:30.836
For starters.

607
01:04:31.003 --> 01:04:33.628
- Tie me up?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

608
01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:37.670
I like the rough stuff.

609
01:04:41.003 --> 01:04:43.045
Really?

610
01:04:47.336 --> 01:04:50.128
Oh, but not too rough.

611
01:04:51.086 --> 01:04:53.503
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

612
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.170
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

613
01:05:04.753 --> 01:05:06.170
Like you mean it.

614
01:05:12.336 --> 01:05:15.545
Do you ever kiss like you mean it, Frank?

615
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:19.045
I'm thinking maybe not.

616
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:21.503
I'm thinking you live alone.

617
01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:24.461
Inside and outside.

618
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:28.211
Thinking it is not dying you're afraid of.

619
01:05:28.378 --> 01:05:30.295
It's living.

620
01:05:30.503 --> 01:05:32.086
Live with me.

621
01:05:32.253 --> 01:05:34.045
Just this once.

622
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:37.711
Just this moment. Live with me.

623
01:06:19.961 --> 01:06:21.920
- What's his position?
- We lost him.

624
01:06:24.003 --> 01:06:28.003
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

625
01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:30.587
Hack into one of the military satellites.

626
01:06:37.753 --> 01:06:38.878
Yes.

627
01:06:39.045 --> 01:06:41.337
You think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

628
01:06:41.503 --> 01:06:43.337
I don't know what you're talking about.

629
01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:46.878
I'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.

630
01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:50.170
<i>One more move like that and you will
never see your daughter again.</i>

631
01:06:50.337 --> 01:06:51.753
I want to hear her voice.

632
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.587
When the contract is signed and delivered.

633
01:06:54.753 --> 01:06:57.170
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

634
01:06:57.337 --> 01:07:00.003
You are in no position
to play hardball, Mr. Minister.

635
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:02.837
Well, neither are you, Mr. Johnson.

636
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.670
<i>Yes, I know who you are.</i>

637
01:07:06.003 --> 01:07:09.087
And I can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...

638
01:07:09.253 --> 01:07:11.170
...I will use all the power I have.

639
01:07:11.337 --> 01:07:16.795
I will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.

640
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:21.420
We have to move now.

641
01:07:27.545 --> 01:07:29.295
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

642
01:07:46.253 --> 01:07:48.962
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

643
01:07:54.212 --> 01:07:56.503
<i>Someone hands me
glass of champagne.</i>

644
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:58.503
<i>I drink.</i>

645
01:07:59.212 --> 01:08:01.712
<i>Then I don't feel so good.</i>

646
01:08:14.628 --> 01:08:17.795
<i>I go to bathroom, and next thing,
I'm awake in the car.</i>

647
01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:22.795
I ask him, "Where is this?"
He tells me he's just a transporter.

648
01:08:26.628 --> 01:08:29.003
He's pretty good driver.

649
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.128
Not like you good.

650
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:39.003
I tell him, "Please.
My father a really powerful man.

651
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:43.587
Big influence. Knows a lot of people.
Let me call him."

652
01:08:43.962 --> 01:08:46.337
<i>He's afraid.
He's never done this before.</i>

653
01:08:47.087 --> 01:08:51.670
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

654
01:08:51.837 --> 01:08:55.212
He's been told no calls,
never leave car.

655
01:08:55.837 --> 01:08:57.587
But I convince him.

656
01:08:59.462 --> 01:09:01.128
<i>I call.</i>

657
01:09:01.753 --> 01:09:04.003
<i>But before I say to my father
where we are...</i>

658
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:05.503
Inside the car. Come on!

659
01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.837
<i>We get away, but...</i>

660
01:09:17.003 --> 01:09:19.670
There's people shooting at us. Why?

661
01:09:19.837 --> 01:09:22.003
Why they shooting at us?

662
01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:27.128
He says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.

663
01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:31.962
I said, "Okay, that's the old plan.
What's new plan?"

664
01:09:32.128 --> 01:09:34.462
He says he has a friend.

665
01:09:43.337 --> 01:09:45.670
And then I met you.

666
01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.128
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

667
01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:57.962
You didn't even know me.

668
01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:00.087
Of course I don't know you.

669
01:10:00.253 --> 01:10:03.795
I talk about feelings, not knowing.

670
01:10:05.878 --> 01:10:10.253
Well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.

671
01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:14.628
Better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.

672
01:10:14.795 --> 01:10:16.295
No?

673
01:10:17.837 --> 01:10:19.337
No.

674
01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:23.170
Yes. Just a little.

675
01:10:49.503 --> 01:10:51.712
He's back on the radar, sir.

676
01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:58.670
- Yeah.
- Where the hell are you?

677
01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:00.045
On the way to Bucharest.

678
01:11:00.337 --> 01:11:01.795
Not any longer.

679
01:11:03.837 --> 01:11:07.462
New coordinates: 3-7-13.

680
01:11:45.337 --> 01:11:47.128
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

681
01:11:47.753 --> 01:11:49.962
Sorry, just a minute.

682
01:11:50.128 --> 01:11:52.253
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseilles.

683
01:11:53.837 --> 01:11:56.128
Well, not exactly Marseilles...

684
01:11:56.295 --> 01:11:59.253
- ...but a small town to the east--
- What do you want, inspector?

685
01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.128
- A word with you.
- I have no time.

686
01:12:02.087 --> 01:12:03.587
It's about your daughter.

687
01:12:11.837 --> 01:12:15.462
Odessa, Frank. My country.

688
01:12:16.087 --> 01:12:19.212
You take me home. Thank you.

689
01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:23.170
What happened to Bucharest?

690
01:12:24.753 --> 01:12:29.628
- Change of plans.
- It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

691
01:12:30.253 --> 01:12:31.878
Yeah.

692
01:12:32.795 --> 01:12:35.962
I was looking forward to that fish
with the carrots myself.

693
01:12:36.128 --> 01:12:38.170
Oh, it's much better here.

694
01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:41.462
- You know chicken Kiev?
- I do.

695
01:12:41.628 --> 01:12:43.837
I know restaurant here.

696
01:12:44.003 --> 01:12:45.378
Best in the world.

697
01:12:45.545 --> 01:12:49.920
The chicken's so fresh.
And the butter, when it's coming out...

698
01:12:50.087 --> 01:12:52.253
Like you cannot believe, it's so nice.

699
01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.378
You know what I feel like now?

700
01:13:03.003 --> 01:13:04.712
Hungry.

701
01:13:07.837 --> 01:13:09.587
Safe.

702
01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:22.045
It's going to end up like the movies,
this happily ever after?

703
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:28.337
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

704
01:13:28.795 --> 01:13:32.837
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

705
01:13:35.045 --> 01:13:36.462
Liar.

706
01:13:54.504 --> 01:13:56.670
<i>Mr. Minister, an update, please.</i>

707
01:13:58.337 --> 01:14:02.795
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

708
01:14:04.587 --> 01:14:07.504
Hello? Hello?

709
01:14:08.004 --> 01:14:10.670
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

710
01:14:19.295 --> 01:14:21.504
<i>- Yeah.
- We are closing the noose, Frank.</i>

711
01:14:22.045 --> 01:14:25.420
Well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.

712
01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.170
You know what this is about yet?

713
01:14:28.337 --> 01:14:30.879
The girl. Her father.

714
01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:33.754
Large amounts of toxic waste.

715
01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.295
It is a trade.
His signature for her life.

716
01:14:38.004 --> 01:14:41.087
I have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.

717
01:14:41.254 --> 01:14:44.504
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

718
01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:48.170
Am I detecting a little attachment?

719
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:53.962
That is not the Frank I know. With his
rules, no names, no attachment.

720
01:14:54.129 --> 01:14:56.337
Why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?

721
01:14:57.004 --> 01:15:02.670
Frank, I always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

722
01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:05.629
Anything else?

723
01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:08.504
<i>Where is the rendezvous?</i>

724
01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.629
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

725
01:15:15.337 --> 01:15:18.004
- Yeah.
- We're almost at the end, Frank.

726
01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:20.754
<i>- Just give me the coordinates.
- No more coordinates.</i>

727
01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.462
The road you're on.

728
01:15:23.754 --> 01:15:25.129
Make your first left.

729
01:15:25.879 --> 01:15:27.420
I'd like to know where I'm going.

730
01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:34.670
You'll know when you get there.

731
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:06.920
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

732
01:16:13.837 --> 01:16:15.837
My compliments, Frank.

733
01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:19.670
Our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.

734
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.004
<i>If you could please
send the girl out.</i>

735
01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:25.170
She's coming.

736
01:16:25.504 --> 01:16:27.670
I'm not coming.

737
01:16:28.337 --> 01:16:30.504
They need you. They won't kill you.

738
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.004
But they will kill you.

739
01:16:33.504 --> 01:16:36.795
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

740
01:16:39.004 --> 01:16:40.004
Do I?

741
01:16:49.254 --> 01:16:51.754
We don't have all day, Frank.

742
01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:57.170
Look how many of them.

743
01:16:57.337 --> 01:16:59.295
They have all the guns.

744
01:16:59.462 --> 01:17:00.670
How it's gonna be okay?

745
01:17:04.795 --> 01:17:06.129
Tell you over dinner.

746
01:17:07.754 --> 01:17:09.004
Now, go.

747
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.170
Go.

748
01:17:11.337 --> 01:17:13.129
Kiss me.

749
01:17:29.962 --> 01:17:31.504
Go.

750
01:17:36.337 --> 01:17:38.920
You're gonna get me killed. Now, go.

751
01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.795
Get to her, you bastard.

752
01:18:31.087 --> 01:18:33.170
Better now, darling?

753
01:18:51.587 --> 01:18:53.129
Finish him.

754
01:19:12.587 --> 01:19:14.920
No! Frank!

755
01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:28.670
His beloved car will be his grave.

756
01:19:28.837 --> 01:19:31.754
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he drowns.
Let's get out of here.

757
01:19:42.962 --> 01:19:45.004
- Tarconi.
- They have the girl.

758
01:19:46.212 --> 01:19:49.670
Frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.

759
01:19:49.837 --> 01:19:52.129
- Where are you?
- In a lake.

760
01:19:53.337 --> 01:19:55.004
A lake?

761
01:19:55.462 --> 01:19:57.337
Can you be more specific?

762
01:19:57.504 --> 01:19:58.837
There's a dam.

763
01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.420
- A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

764
01:20:02.587 --> 01:20:04.420
- How far?
- Ten minutes at least.

765
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:06.504
Frank, we'll be there in 10 minutes.

766
01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:08.004
Can you make it any faster?

767
01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.754
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you.

768
01:22:09.046 --> 01:22:10.587
Buy tickets for all of us.

769
01:22:11.171 --> 01:22:12.587
Where to?

770
01:22:12.754 --> 01:22:16.712
Anywhere this train is going. We need
to keep moving for half an hour.

771
01:22:16.879 --> 01:22:18.837
Why don't we just keep driving around?

772
01:22:24.462 --> 01:22:25.879
Another day.

773
01:22:40.337 --> 01:22:42.879
Sir! There!

774
01:23:00.046 --> 01:23:04.254
- Out. Out!
- Everybody out!

775
01:23:04.421 --> 01:23:05.837
- Come on.
- Move!

776
01:23:06.587 --> 01:23:08.171
Move, quick!

777
01:23:26.087 --> 01:23:27.796
- Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

778
01:23:28.379 --> 01:23:30.129
Someone wants to talk to you.

779
01:23:31.421 --> 01:23:34.129
- Papa.
- Are you all right?

780
01:23:38.671 --> 01:23:40.337
Don't sign.

781
01:23:41.004 --> 01:23:44.129
What you have is 15 minutes.

782
01:23:51.337 --> 01:23:54.087
- You ever find out what this is about?
- Garbage.

783
01:23:54.254 --> 01:23:55.837
How much garbage are we talking?

784
01:23:56.712 --> 01:24:00.337
Enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.

785
01:24:00.504 --> 01:24:01.504
Try it again.

786
01:24:22.171 --> 01:24:25.546
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

787
01:24:25.796 --> 01:24:27.504
This is the new world.

788
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:30.921
There are no more countries.
That's old think.

789
01:24:31.337 --> 01:24:34.712
There are just economic realities.
Profit and loss.

790
01:24:34.879 --> 01:24:37.671
Efficiency and waste.

791
01:24:37.837 --> 01:24:39.837
Think global, not local.

792
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:42.587
Think this.

793
01:24:57.337 --> 01:24:59.337
- Yes?
- Where are we?

794
01:25:06.921 --> 01:25:08.462
We're almost there.

795
01:25:11.046 --> 01:25:12.462
Where?

796
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:14.671
Here. He is on a train.

797
01:25:15.296 --> 01:25:17.671
- And where are we?
- Here.

798
01:25:17.837 --> 01:25:20.046
We can get units there.

799
01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:23.504
That's a good idea. Do that.

800
01:25:27.462 --> 01:25:30.337
Oh, Frank, come on.

801
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:04.754
Mr. Minister, I assure you,
everything is in order.

802
01:26:04.921 --> 01:26:06.837
I'm sure it is.

803
01:26:07.212 --> 01:26:11.087
- If there are any problems...
- I know you will solve them.

804
01:26:12.004 --> 01:26:13.921
Now, if you don't mind...

805
01:26:44.254 --> 01:26:47.837
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

806
01:26:49.046 --> 01:26:51.171
I hate violence.

807
01:26:53.129 --> 01:26:55.962
It creates more problems than it solves.

808
01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:00.421
You know, I never wanted to do any of this.

809
01:27:01.879 --> 01:27:05.004
A client asked me to obtain a result...

810
01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:07.546
...so I went about creating
an environment...

811
01:27:07.712 --> 01:27:09.504
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.

812
01:27:09.671 --> 01:27:12.462
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

813
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:16.421
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

814
01:27:17.504 --> 01:27:20.129
Everyone wanted to fight.

815
01:27:35.463 --> 01:27:36.671
What's so funny?

816
01:27:37.879 --> 01:27:40.421
Hearing a dead man talking.

817
01:29:53.129 --> 01:29:55.088
One more step, Frank.

818
01:29:55.504 --> 01:29:57.046
Come on. One more.

819
01:30:40.588 --> 01:30:42.046
Look.

820
01:30:42.379 --> 01:30:43.463
It's over.

821
01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:46.004
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

822
01:30:49.796 --> 01:30:51.921
Oh, my God.

823
01:30:57.171 --> 01:30:58.629
No, Frank. No, no.

824
01:31:39.546 --> 01:31:42.004
It's over, Frank. It's over.

825
01:31:43.254 --> 01:31:45.754
Mission accomplished.
You and the girl are free to go.

826
01:31:47.338 --> 01:31:49.671
Matter of fact,
I'm so impressed by your talent...

827
01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.546
...I'd like to offer you a position.

828
01:31:51.713 --> 01:31:55.046
I'd like to offer you one.
Permanently disabled.

829
01:32:14.296 --> 01:32:15.671
I hate to waste talent.

830
01:32:15.838 --> 01:32:18.171
But I really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

831
01:32:18.338 --> 01:32:19.838
That's right.

832
01:32:43.588 --> 01:32:44.713
No!

833
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:51.838
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

834
01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:57.671
No, no.

835
01:33:08.921 --> 01:33:10.004
No!

836
01:33:11.588 --> 01:33:12.838
No!

837
01:33:28.504 --> 01:33:30.421
You're doing the right thing.

838
01:33:50.213 --> 01:33:52.004
Valentina.

839
01:33:57.088 --> 01:33:58.338
Valentina.

840
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:10.796
Am I in heaven?

841
01:34:13.879 --> 01:34:16.171
Looks more like we're in hell.

842
01:34:16.671 --> 01:34:18.504
I don't care.

843
01:34:18.796 --> 01:34:20.504
As long as we're there together.

844
01:34:32.796 --> 01:34:33.880
Yes?

845
01:34:34.046 --> 01:34:37.255
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

846
01:34:38.713 --> 01:34:40.338
Thank you.

847
01:34:54.838 --> 01:34:57.255
- What are you doing?
- What you said, the right thing.

848
01:34:57.421 --> 01:35:00.671
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

849
01:35:00.838 --> 01:35:03.838
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.

850
01:35:04.005 --> 01:35:05.005
Thank you very much.

851
01:35:24.171 --> 01:35:25.213
Is the launch ready?

852
01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:27.755
- It's on the water, sir, waiting.
- Time to leave.

853
01:35:28.463 --> 01:35:29.838
- Grab the log.
- Okay.

854
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.796
I just don't understand it.

855
01:35:51.963 --> 01:35:53.963
When I was a boy, my father and I...

856
01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:57.505
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

857
01:35:57.671 --> 01:35:59.338
Times change, inspector.

858
01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.671
As do people.

859
01:36:04.630 --> 01:36:06.588
You referring to me?

860
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:10.255
I don't think that's
a very accurate statement.

861
01:36:11.171 --> 01:36:13.421
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

862
01:36:13.588 --> 01:36:17.755
Oh, I was not referring
to your car or your house.

863
01:36:20.588 --> 01:36:23.005
The sea is so restful.

864
01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:24.338
Is lunch ready yet?

865
01:36:25.588 --> 01:36:28.921
Mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.

866
01:36:29.088 --> 01:36:32.463
In order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.

867
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:34.880
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

868
01:36:35.046 --> 01:36:36.421
...we're gonna catch nothing.

869
01:36:36.588 --> 01:36:40.338
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

870
01:36:40.505 --> 01:36:42.505
...and go right to eating of lunch?

871
01:36:42.671 --> 01:36:45.838
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

872
01:36:46.005 --> 01:36:48.963
...where they make fish stew.
Incredible.

873
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:54.921
They use tomatoes and onions,
and little amount of wild lavender.

874
01:36:55.588 --> 01:36:57.505
What kind of wine?

875
01:36:57.671 --> 01:36:59.463
Pink. From south.

876
01:37:00.713 --> 01:37:02.588
A Châteauneuf, perhaps.

877
01:37:03.005 --> 01:37:05.505
