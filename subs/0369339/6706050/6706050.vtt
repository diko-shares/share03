1
00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:07.692
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, mate.

2
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.193
Don't worry about it.

3
00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.820
You all right?

4
00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.199
Enjoy LA.

5
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.675
- He did it.
- It's all right.

6
00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.225
Can you tell me why everything
is always about you?

7
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.768
Everything is not always about me.

8
00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.271
That gearhead with his pocket protector
was being sarcastic.

9
00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.814
- You damn well know it.
- "Sarcastic."

10
00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.983
- I'm sorry, I just didn't see it that way.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

11
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.151
What about the dig about the makeover?
That was really nice.

12
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.654
What do you want me to do?
I work with the man.

13
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:19.574
You're perfectly capable
of taking care of your own shit.

14
00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:23.160
You know something? The last time
I checked, you were sleeping with me.

15
00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.373
So unless you want to start
fucking him, I suggest...

16
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.431
Pal, where can I catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?

17
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.642
- Back there.
- Thanks.

18
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.906
It was him in that gold Lexus
on the cell phone.

19
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.185
Are they still asking
for a change of venue?

20
00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.708
He's enhanceable because of priors
in the early '80s.

21
00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:58.339
- Where to?
- Downtown. 312 North Spring Street.

22
00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.924
Downtown.

23
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:07.599
Look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7:00 a.m., period. Okay?

24
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.228
Hold on.
Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea.

25
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.106
Take La Brea north to 6th into downtown.

26
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.317
So what? You'll be up late.

27
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.444
I'm pulling an all-nighter, too,
so save the tears.

28
00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.863
I'll take the 105 east to the 110.
That's faster.

29
00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.073
What?

30
00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.867
I said, the 105 to the 110,
that'll get you there quicker.

31
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.328
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

32
00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:33.624
But once you get to La Brea north
of Santa Monica, then it's jammed.

33
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.000
The 110 north of the 10,

34
00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:38.129
you get people driving to Pasadena,
and they drive slow.

35
00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.841
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand, and then I...

36
00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.263
Hey, surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.

37
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.145
- Are we taking bets?
- Are we?

38
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.855
But what if you're wrong?

39
00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.318
I don't think I'm gonna be wrong,
but if I am, the ride's free.

40
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.199
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

41
00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.349
Go ahead, say it.

42
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:33.643
- Say what?
- Go ahead.

43
00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.146
- I got lucky with the lights.
- You weren't lucky with the lights.

44
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.816
What you were was right. I was wrong.

45
00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.444
Max.

46
00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.413
You mind turning that up?

47
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.291
You like the classics.

48
00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.043
I do. I used to play in high school.

49
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.420
- Let me guess. Woodwinds.
- No. Strings.

50
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.297
I never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

51
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.759
Could've fooled me by the way
you were unloading on that cell phone.

52
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.720
Different instrument.

53
00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.807
If you had just listened to me, we'd be
all bogged down in traffic right now.

54
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:15.893
You would've made yourself
an extra five bucks.

55
00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:19.772
Well, you keep that five bucks.
Buy you something special. Go wild.

56
00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:24.652
Really, it's not that... It's not
a big deal. Nothing big here.

57
00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.570
Well, how many cabbies do you know

58
00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.572
get you into an argument
to save you money?

59
00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:32.406
There were two of us. I had to kill
the other one. I don't like competition.

60
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:39.124
Take pride in being good at what you do?

61
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.751
What, this?

62
00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.170
This is... No, this is part-time.

63
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.839
This is a fill-in job. Pay the bills.

64
00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:49.802
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

65
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:56.267
- What else?
- Just shaping up some things.

66
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.478
Like?

67
00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.397
Tell me.

68
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.275
Limo company I'm putting together.
Island Limos.

69
00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:08.028
It's gonna be like an island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

70
00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:11.490
When you get to the airport,
you're not gonna wanna get out of my limo.

71
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.618
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases,

72
00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:18.164
staff up, get the right client list,
you know, things like that.

73
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.669
How do you like being a lawyer?

74
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:27.172
- What are you, psychic?
- Little bit.

75
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.133
There's the dark pinstripe suit.

76
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.385
Elegant, not too flashy.
That rules out advertising.

77
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.513
Plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.

78
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.266
And the purse. A Bottega.

79
00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:41.843
Anyway, a man gets in my cab
with a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

80
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:44.482
You?

81
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.359
Clarence Darrow.

82
00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:49.236
Well, no, not quite.

83
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.447
He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor.

84
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.282
- Big case?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.661
- Got us here fast.
- Of course.

86
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.997
But you didn't answer my question.

87
00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:44.459
Do you like what you do?

88
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.295
Yeah.

89
00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.091
But not today.

90
00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:56.053
No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

91
00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:00.099
I love standing in that courtroom.

92
00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.435
At the same time,
I get this clenched-up thing

93
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.119
the night before the first days.

94
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.733
Clenched up? How?

95
00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.999
I think I'm gonna lose,
I think the case sucks,

96
00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.835
my exhibits aren't in order,
I'm not prepared enough,

97
00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:30.045
people are gonna find out
that I don't know what I'm doing

98
00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.798
and I've been running some charade
all these years.

99
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.925
I represent the Department of Justice,

100
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.178
and my opening statement is gonna
fall flat at the most important point,

101
00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:39.912
and the jury's gonna laugh at me.

102
00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:47.062
And then I cry. I don't throw up.

103
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:50.483
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

104
00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.110
And then I pull myself together,

105
00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:56.864
I rewrite my opening statement,
work my exhibits,

106
00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.199
and that's what I do
for the rest of the night.

107
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:01.035
That's my routine.

108
00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:07.291
In the morning, it starts, and I'm fine.

109
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.127
You need a vacation.

110
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.629
I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

111
00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:15.424
Not in a cab.
You need to get your head straight.

112
00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:19.052
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic, you know...

113
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:20.804
When was the last time you took a break?

114
00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.681
- I go on a vacation all the time.
- How often?

115
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.725
A dozen times a day.

116
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.644
My favorite spot.

117
00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.605
Maldives Island.

118
00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.234
It's my own private getaway.

119
00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:37.321
Things get heavy for me,
I take five minutes out,

120
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.282
and I just go there.

121
00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.535
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

122
00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:52.169
- Here. Take it.
- No. I couldn't do that.

123
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.339
Take it. Because you need it
a lot more than I do.

124
00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.884
And it'll help you. I guarantee it.

125
00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.524
Thanks, Max.

126
00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:15.818
Go get 'em.

127
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.724
Hey.

128
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.232
I don't know.

129
00:12:55.316 --> 00:13:00.738
In case you ever wanna investigate
a Fortune 500 company or...

130
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.867
argue cab routes.

131
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.018
Hey.

132
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.066
Hey, yeah. Come on, man, I'm sorry.

133
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.820
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.
I'll take you.

134
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.579
- Where to?
- 1039 South Union Street.

135
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:33.748
Gotcha.

136
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.974
- How long you think this'll take?
- Seven minutes.

137
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:55.269
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

138
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.021
Two minutes to get across
the 110 to Normandie.

139
00:14:58.105 --> 00:14:59.606
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

140
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.275
Over to Union is one.
Plus one for "shit happens."

141
00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.277
- Okay if I time you?
- Knock yourself out.

142
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:06.113
What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

143
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.991
You get an apology.
I already offered my free ride today.

144
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.785
- To who?
- Some girl.

145
00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:14.288
Did you get a date with her?

146
00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:18.500
- First time in LA?
- No.

147
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.584
Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here,
I can't wait to leave.

148
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.215
Too sprawled out, disconnected. You know.

149
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:28.301
- That's me. You like it?
- It's my home.

150
00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:29.594
Seventeen million people.

151
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:31.847
This was a country, it'd be
the fifth biggest economy in the world,

152
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.099
and nobody knows each other.

153
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:37.561
I read about this guy,
gets on the MTA here, dies.

154
00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.522
Six hours he's riding the subway

155
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.567
before anybody notices his corpse
doing laps around LA.

156
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.736
People on and off sitting next to him.

157
00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.239
Nobody notices.

158
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:55.871
This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

159
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:59.833
- Regular ride?
- Yeah. I share it with the day-shift guy.

160
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.586
- Because you prefer nights?
- Yeah. People are more relaxed.

161
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.880
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

162
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.050
- How are the benefits?
- It's not that kind of job.

163
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.887
I'm not in this for the long haul.
I'm just filling in, you know.

164
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.347
Just temporary while I'm getting
some things shaped up.

165
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:15.849
This is just temporary.

166
00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:18.083
- How long you been driving?
- Twelve years.

167
00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:20.104
Really?

168
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:23.482
What other things you putting together?

169
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.575
I don't wanna talk about it.
Just a little business plan.

170
00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.870
- No offense. I just...
- None taken.

171
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.373
You're one of these guys
that do instead of talk.

172
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.500
That's cool.

173
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:53.136
- Seven minutes. Man, you're good.
- I got lucky with the lights.

174
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.140
Yeah, sure. You probably know
the light schedules, too.

175
00:16:57.308 --> 00:17:01.394
Listen, I'm in town on a real-estate deal.
Close in one night.

176
00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:04.731
I got five stops to make.
Collect signatures, see some friends.

177
00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:08.443
And then I got a 6:00 a.m. out of LAX.
Why don't you hang with me?

178
00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.654
The car's not for hire, man.
That's against regs.

179
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.323
- Regulations?
- Yeah.

180
00:17:13.073 --> 00:17:16.423
These guys don't pay you sick leave.
How much you pull down a shift?

181
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.745
- How much?
- 350, 400.

182
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.374
Yeah? Well, let me tell you what.
I'll make it 600.

183
00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:25.919
Man, I don't know.

184
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:28.505
Plus an extra hundred, you get me to LAX
and I don't have to run for the plane.

185
00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:30.507
I don't know about this.

186
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:31.967
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

187
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.178
- I don't know, man.
- Yeah, you do.

188
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.764
- Six hundred...
- Cool. We got a deal.

189
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.131
Here's 300 down. What's your name?

190
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.935
- Max.
- Max.

191
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:42.978
- I'm Vincent.
- All right.

192
00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.359
I can't stay double-parked here, though.

193
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.944
I'll meet you in the alley
behind the building.

194
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.029
All right.

195
00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.881
Definitely not from around here.

196
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.986
There you go.

197
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:13.861
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

198
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.075
What the...

199
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.828
What the hell? Damn it!

200
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:25.539
My man, you all right?

201
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.958
Shit. Fuck.

202
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:35.549
He fell on the cab.

203
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.595
He fell from up there
on the motherfucking cab.

204
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:43.057
- Shit. I think he's dead.
- Good guess.

205
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.274
You killed him?

206
00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:55.819
No, I shot him.
Bullets and the fall killed him.

207
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.282
Oh, man. Fuck this, man.

208
00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.166
- Red light, Max.
- Hold on. Hold on.

209
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.495
Put your hands down.

210
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.873
- Put your hands down.
- Okay. Okay.

211
00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:13.795
Okay, help me out. Pop the trunk.

212
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.840
- What?
- Pop the trunk.

213
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:21.136
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.

214
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.139
- What you doing?
- I'm gonna roll him off the roof.

215
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.683
Can't leave him here.
So unless you want him up front with you.

216
00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.143
But given the hygiene...

217
00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.437
- Shit.
- Okay.

218
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.106
It's only a dead guy.

219
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.900
Grab his hands.

220
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.486
- I can't do this.
- Grab his wrists.

221
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:44.660
- You got it?
- Yeah. He's twitching and shit.

222
00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:49.957
Fuck.

223
00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:04.388
Okay. That's good enough.

224
00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:11.895
- Let's go.
- Hey, why don't you just take the cab?

225
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.146
- Take the cab?
- Yeah, you take it.

226
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:16.775
I'll chill. I'll just chill.

227
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.152
They don't even know who's driving
these things half the time anyway.

228
00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.786
They never check or anything.
Okay? So just take it.

229
00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:23.323
You, me...

230
00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.910
- You promise not to tell anybody, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

231
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:29.455
Promise.

232
00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.397
Get in the fucking car.

233
00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.001
Get in the car.

234
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.787
Ramone.

235
00:22:58.585 --> 00:22:59.878
Ramone.

236
00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:15.852
Ramone!

237
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:29.199
Ramone!

238
00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:53.974
Fuck.

239
00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:05.401
<i>Rampart watch commander.</i>

240
00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:07.237
This is Detective Fanning, Narcotics.

241
00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:11.908
Send two black-and-whites and
a night detective to 1039 South Union.

242
00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:14.160
And contact SID. I got a crime scene.

243
00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:15.996
<i>Roger. 1039 South Union.</i>

244
00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:31.010
- What are you doing?
- I got to clean it up. It's a mess.

245
00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:34.556
So? Lady Macbeth, we're sitting here,
and the light's green.

246
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.224
Leave the seats.

247
00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:42.105
Asshole!

248
00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.776
You no longer have
the cleanest cab in la-la land.

249
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.322
You gotta live with that.
You focus on the job. Drive.

250
00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:56.202
7565 Fountain. You know it?

251
00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:58.246
- West Hollywood.
- How long you figure?

252
00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:00.289
I don't know, man, 17 minutes.

253
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.627
Why?

254
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.379
No, no, no. Hold on, man.

255
00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:10.091
- I told you we had other stops to make.
- You said you had to visit some friends.

256
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.135
- Well, they're somebody's friends.
- No.

257
00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:15.138
You drive a cab, I make my rounds

258
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:19.225
you might make it through the night,
come out 700 bucks ahead.

259
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:21.603
I'm not trying to piss you off,
but I can't do this.

260
00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:24.063
I can't drive you around
while you go around killing people.

261
00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:26.149
- It ain't my job.
- Tonight it is.

262
00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:30.779
Look, you don't get it.
I mean it. I mean it.

263
00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:34.073
I'm not up for this.

264
00:25:34.157 --> 00:25:36.451
- Okay, you're stressed.
- Yes, I am.

265
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:38.745
You're stressed. I understand that.

266
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:42.332
Now, you just keep breathing
and stay calm.

267
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:44.250
- Are you breathing?
- Shit.

268
00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:45.418
- Are you breathing?
- Yes.

269
00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:46.962
Okay, good.

270
00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.343
Okay, look, here's the deal.

271
00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:56.095
You were gonna drive me around tonight
and never be the wiser,

272
00:25:56.179 --> 00:25:59.725
but <i>el gordo</i> got in front of a window,
did his high dive.

273
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.228
We're into plan B. You still breathing?

274
00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:07.190
We gotta make the best of it.
Improvise. Adapt to the environment.

275
00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:10.985
Darwin. Shit happens. <i>I Ching.</i>
Whatever, man. We gotta roll with it.

276
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:14.113
<i>I Ching</i>. What are you talking about, man?
You threw a man out of a window.

277
00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:16.199
I didn't throw him. He fell.

278
00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.744
Well, what did he do to you?

279
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:22.080
- What?
- What did he do to you?

280
00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:24.082
Nothing. I only met him tonight.

281
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:26.616
You just met him once,
and you kill him like that?

282
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.379
What, I should only kill people
after I get to know them?

283
00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:30.630
No, man.

284
00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.882
Max, six billion people on the planet,

285
00:26:32.966 --> 00:26:34.926
you're getting bent out of shape
because of one fat guy.

286
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.388
- Well, who was he?
- What do you care?

287
00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:40.932
- Have you ever heard of Rwanda?
- Yes, I know Rwanda.

288
00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:43.309
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.

289
00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:46.562
Nobody's killed people that fast
since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

290
00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:48.231
- Did you bat an eye, Max?
- What?

291
00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:51.067
Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam,

292
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:54.153
Save the Whales,
Greenpeace or something? No.

293
00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:57.073
I off one fat Angeleno,
and you throw a hissy fit.

294
00:26:57.157 --> 00:26:58.825
Man, I don't know any Rwandans.

295
00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:01.160
You don't know the guy
in the trunk either.

296
00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:02.537
Man.

297
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:06.708
Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
he was a criminal

298
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:09.085
involved in a continuing
criminal enterprise.

299
00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:11.671
What are you doing,
just taking out the garbage?

300
00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:13.423
Yeah. Something like that.

301
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.801
<i>- Pull over to the right.</i>
- Shit.

302
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.680
- Get rid of them.
- How?

303
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:23.683
You're a cabbie.
Talk yourself out of a ticket.

304
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.064
Just, please, man, don't do anything.

305
00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:33.234
Then don't let me get cornered.
You don't have the trunk space.

306
00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:35.236
- I can't believe this.
- Believe it.

307
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.988
Don't. I'll talk to them.

308
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.327
He's probably married.

309
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.540
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife's pregnant.

310
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:51.257
Yeah, I'll take care of it. I got it.
I'll deal with it. Yeah. Just a second.

311
00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:54.297
- How you doing?
- Hey.

312
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:56.424
My partner's gonna help you out
on that side over there.

313
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.093
License, registration.

314
00:27:58.969 --> 00:28:00.262
Yeah.

315
00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:06.935
I'm pulling you over
because your windshield's smashed.

316
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.022
- All this current?
- Yes, Officer.

317
00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.942
Hey, man, what'd you do,
have a food fight in here?

318
00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:18.446
Yeah, I'll... Pretty messy.
Just clean it up.

319
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.826
Hey, is this blood up here
on your windshield?

320
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.245
Yeah.

321
00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:28.707
Yeah, I hit a deer.

322
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:32.002
- You hit a deer?
- Yeah, over on...

323
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:36.423
- I was on Slauson.
- A South Central deer?

324
00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:39.550
Yeah, they out there.

325
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:42.678
It ran right in front of the car
and I couldn't avoid it.

326
00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:45.139
Why you still carrying a passenger?

327
00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:47.141
I was on my way to the depot and he's...

328
00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:49.393
I could just drop him.
His drop is on my way.

329
00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:52.104
Yeah, but your cab's unsafe to drive
and we have to impound it.

330
00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:55.149
So we gotta do a vehicle inventory
before the tow truck gets here.

331
00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.151
So pop the trunk and step out the vehicle.

332
00:28:57.235 --> 00:29:00.029
Sir, I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to call another cab.

333
00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:02.740
Is that really necessary, Officer?
I'm just a half a mile from here.

334
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.368
Yes, sir, I'm afraid it is.
Please, step out the vehicle.

335
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:08.204
- You, too. Come on.
- If you open that trunk, they go inside.

336
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.388
You know what, man?
It's been a long night.

337
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:13.835
Plus, the barn is right up there.

338
00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.337
Just give me a break. It's my first fare.

339
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.548
Get out the cab. Open the trunk. Come on.

340
00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:24.137
Step out. You, too, sir. Please.

341
00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:29.809
<i>This is Rampart Division dispatch.
Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover.</i>

342
00:29:30.727 --> 00:29:32.895
<i>All available Precinct 26 units respond.
Over.</i>

343
00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:35.773
- Hey, partner, we gotta roll.
- Roger. En route.

344
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.307
Go straight to the garage.
Have a nice night, sir.

345
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.300
Stop here.

346
00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:31.245
- Hands on the wheel, 10 and 2.
- Why?

347
00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.914
Because I say so.

348
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.051
<i>- Max. Max.</i>
- Shit.

349
00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:47.137
<i>You out there, you son of a bitch?</i>

350
00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:50.640
Who is that?

351
00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.851
That's Lenny. Just dispatch.

352
00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:57.563
<i>Max, I know you're out there.
Answer the goddamn call.</i>

353
00:30:57.647 --> 00:31:00.399
- What happens if you don't?
- He just keeps calling me.

354
00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:02.152
<i>Max, answer.</i>

355
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.159
Don't blow it.

356
00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:14.747
- Yeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.
<i>- Just got off the phone with the cops.</i>

357
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:17.709
<i>Desk sergeant called to check
you brought the cab in.</i>

358
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:21.671
- Yeah, so?
<i>- So aside from I hate talking to cops,</i>

359
00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:24.131
<i>they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?</i>

360
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:27.635
No. No, I got crashed into. I didn't...

361
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.430
<i>Do I care what, where or why?
You're paying.</i>

362
00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.397
It was an accident. You're not liable.

363
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.650
It was an accident. I'm not liable.

364
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:45.611
<i>Bullshit. I'm making you liable.
It's coming out of your goddamn pocket.</i>

365
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:47.446
You tell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

366
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.699
- I can't do that. That's my boss.
- So?

367
00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:52.202
- I need my job.
- No, you don't.

368
00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:56.163
<i>You still there? I'm talking to you.
Max! Max!</i>

369
00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:59.626
- He's not paying you a damn thing.
<i>- Who the hell is this?</i>

370
00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:06.340
Albert Riccardo, Assistant US Attorney,

371
00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:09.135
a passenger in this cab,
and I'm reporting you to the DMV.

372
00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:11.303
<i>- Let's not get excited.</i>
- Not get excited?

373
00:32:11.387 --> 00:32:12.888
How am I supposed to not get excited,

374
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:14.974
listening to you
try to extort a working man?

375
00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:16.809
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

376
00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:19.395
and general-liability umbrella
will cover the damages.

377
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:22.023
What are you trying to pull,
you sarcastic prick?

378
00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:24.066
<i>- I was just trying to...</i>
- Tell it to him.

379
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.528
Tell him he's an asshole. Go ahead.

380
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:29.155
You're an asshole.

381
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.823
Tell him he pulls this shit again,

382
00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:33.493
you're gonna stick this yellow cab
up his fat ass.

383
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.831
And next time you pull any shit, I'm...

384
00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:42.293
I'm gonna have to stick this yellow cab
up your fat ass.

385
00:32:58.184 --> 00:32:59.643
Shit!

386
00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:02.897
<i>Things like protective orders,
because you think of domestic stalking</i>

387
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:06.358
<i>where a husband wants his wife back
or boyfriend-girlfriend kind of thing.</i>

388
00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:08.611
<i>We always hear,
"Get your protective order."</i>

389
00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:10.571
<i>Well, a protective order's
a tool that we use,</i>

390
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:13.505
<i>but often times it's just
a piece of paper to the stalker.</i>

391
00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:15.743
Yeah.

392
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.620
<i>Mr. Clarke,
there's a notary here to see you.</i>

393
00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:19.371
Well, did he identify himself as a notary?

394
00:33:19.455 --> 00:33:21.290
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

395
00:33:21.374 --> 00:33:23.710
All right, sure, send him up.

396
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:53.698
Hey! Hey, I'm in the cab!

397
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:55.825
Hey!

398
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.996
Shit. Down here in the... in the alley!

399
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.332
Shit!

400
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:10.673
Hey, hold up.

401
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:20.099
Oh, man, yeah. Hey, yeah, right there.

402
00:34:20.183 --> 00:34:23.686
I'm in the cab, man. I'm stuck.
Thank you. Thank you.

403
00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:27.565
Hey, man. Look, I gotta get out of here.

404
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:31.652
- What's up, man? What's going on?
- Look, this guy tied me up.

405
00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:34.196
He's up in this building,
wreaking havoc, doing some wild shit.

406
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.407
- I need to get out of here.
- You all tied up in there, huh?

407
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:38.742
Yeah, I'm trapped. Get me outta here
so we can call the cops.

408
00:34:38.826 --> 00:34:40.703
Why don't you give me your fucking wallet?

409
00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:44.040
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding you?

410
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:48.258
Listen, don't you see that my hands
are tied to the steering wheel?

411
00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:52.298
I don't give a damn what they're tied to.
I'll fuck you up.

412
00:34:52.382 --> 00:34:55.176
- Don't shoot, man.
- Then get your ass up.

413
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.511
- Fuck.
- Yo.

414
00:34:57.637 --> 00:35:00.974
What the fuck else you got in here?
Jackpot.

415
00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:05.270
Thanks, for real.

416
00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:14.696
Yo, homey.

417
00:35:18.324 --> 00:35:19.617
That my briefcase?

418
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:22.787
This your briefcase? Yeah, it is.
Why, you want it back?

419
00:35:23.246 --> 00:35:25.081
How about your wallet?

420
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.918
What else you got for me?

421
00:35:33.756 --> 00:35:34.799
Fuck!

422
00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:53.526
Where's the button? Under the dash?

423
00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:01.951
Mind getting it?

424
00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:17.925
You attract attention, you're gonna get
people killed who didn't need to be.

425
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.635
You understand?

426
00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:21.304
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

427
00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:33.524
But, hey, new news.
We're ahead of schedule.

428
00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:37.861
- You like jazz?
- I'm sorry. What?

429
00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:41.282
- Jazz. You like jazz?
- Not that much.

430
00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:45.661
Guy told me about this place off Crenshaw.

431
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:48.330
Leimert Park.
All the West Coast greats played there.

432
00:36:48.414 --> 00:36:53.044
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,
Chet Baker. Like that.

433
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:57.298
Come on, finish up. Buy you a drink.

434
00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:10.853
This informant of yours,
what's his name? Ramone?

435
00:37:10.937 --> 00:37:14.315
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

436
00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.026
He doesn't show up,
I roll here, find this.

437
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.160
Yeah, how long you been working this guy?

438
00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:21.655
Four months. He's a low-level player.

439
00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:24.867
Part of a distribution network
that hooks up to Felix.

440
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:26.411
Felix Reyes-Torrena?

441
00:37:27.203 --> 00:37:29.496
Feds are all over him.
They don't want us anywhere near it.

442
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.999
Since when's LAPD working for the Feeb?

443
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:34.501
If they're into it,
they're just gonna take all our stuff,

444
00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:37.004
build their case, take all the credit.
So what is the point?

445
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:39.214
The point is, is my guy flew out a window.

446
00:37:39.298 --> 00:37:40.924
So if my CI flies out a window,

447
00:37:41.008 --> 00:37:43.802
then he's got Felix's handprints
on his ass.

448
00:37:43.886 --> 00:37:45.346
That makes it mine.

449
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.058
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

450
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:53.103
- I just see a bunch of broken glass.
- And blood.

451
00:37:53.187 --> 00:37:56.482
Down here, in the glass. Here's some more.

452
00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:59.694
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

453
00:38:00.736 --> 00:38:02.905
<i>- Richard?</i>
- Yeah, it's me.

454
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.082
Ramone went through that window, splat.

455
00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:17.211
Glass here. Then tires rolled over it.

456
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:20.214
- Maybe he jumped.
- Sure.

457
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:23.634
He's depressed, so he jumps four stories
out of a window onto his head.

458
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.761
"Wow, that feels better."
Picks himself up.

459
00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:28.245
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day."

460
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.351
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Ray! Catch.

461
00:38:36.772 --> 00:38:39.567
- Recent?
- You can still smell the cordite.

462
00:38:41.027 --> 00:38:43.112
Old guy across the alley
watching late-night TV

463
00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:45.406
says he saw a cab parked here
earlier tonight

464
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.950
with two guys walking around the hood.

465
00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:49.618
Description? He see anything?

466
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.663
Kind of saw.
Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.

467
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:55.290
There are 4,000 taxicabs in LA County.

468
00:38:55.374 --> 00:38:57.459
- You got anything else?
- That's it.

469
00:38:57.543 --> 00:39:00.630
Okay. Keep knocking. Let's keep knocking.

470
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.841
Remember that Bay Area deal? Oakland?

471
00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:06.427
Cabbie drove around all night,
killed three people,

472
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:09.221
- then put the gun to his head.
- Yeah, the guy flipped out. So what?

473
00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:12.141
So that Oakland PD detective,
what's-his-name, he never bought it.

474
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:15.175
Cabbie had no criminal record,
no history of mental illness.

475
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.563
Pops three people, then himself?

476
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:23.110
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

477
00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.978
I never learned to listen to jazz.

478
00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:02.191
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

479
00:40:02.775 --> 00:40:06.195
- Improvising, like tonight.
- Like tonight?

480
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:32.763
Most people, ten years from now,

481
00:40:32.847 --> 00:40:35.265
same job, same place, same routine,
everything the same.

482
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:38.060
Just keeping it safe
over and over and over.

483
00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:39.979
Ten years from now.

484
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:43.774
Man, you don't know where you'll be
ten minutes from now.

485
00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:46.527
Do you?

486
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:05.504
- Who is that on the trumpet?
- That's Daniel, baby. He's the owner.

487
00:41:07.757 --> 00:41:11.385
He's terrific. Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

488
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.680
- I gotta buy him a drink.
- Sure thing, darling.

489
00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:26.149
<i>No, now, see, I was about 19,
bussing tables right here.</i>

490
00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:29.069
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

491
00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.989
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

492
00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:33.657
I mean, take this one night.

493
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:36.952
July 22nd, 1964.
Who you think walks through that door?

494
00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:38.745
Bye, baby.

495
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.248
Miles Davis. That's right.

496
00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.541
- In the flesh?
- That's right.

497
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:46.003
I'm talking about through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

498
00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:47.379
Jesus.

499
00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:51.759
Anyway, he had been at a recording session
up at Columbia, up on Vine.

500
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.094
So Miles comes through that door.

501
00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:58.307
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

502
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.560
- It had to be...
- It was scary.

503
00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:04.313
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

504
00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:06.690
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway, man.

505
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:08.191
Everybody and their mama knew

506
00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:11.320
that you don't just come up
and talk to Miles Davis.

507
00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:15.824
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

508
00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:20.162
This one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

509
00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:23.290
And the guy says, "Hi, my name is..."

510
00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:25.834
Miles said, "Get the fuck out of my face,
you jive motherfucker.

511
00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:28.254
Take your silly bitch with you."

512
00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:32.507
You know? That's... That was Miles, man.

513
00:42:32.591 --> 00:42:36.846
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

514
00:42:37.304 --> 00:42:38.805
But did you get to talk to him?

515
00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.089
- Better than that.
- No.

516
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:44.353
- I played for about 20 minutes.
- Unbelievable.

517
00:42:44.437 --> 00:42:46.146
- How'd you do?
- How'd I do?

518
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.232
Well, you really ain't shit when
you're playing next to Miles Davis.

519
00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:51.526
But he carried my ass.

520
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.905
- What'd he say?
- He said one word. "Cool."

521
00:42:55.364 --> 00:42:56.907
- "Cool"?
- Yeah.

522
00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:58.492
- That's it?
- Yeah.

523
00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.869
That meant, "Good, but not ready."

524
00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:03.497
It meant, "Look me up when you are."

525
00:43:04.206 --> 00:43:06.208
- Did you?
- No.

526
00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:10.087
I got drafted
and got into some other things,

527
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:14.633
and by the time I got back to music,
the season had passed.

528
00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:18.553
But, you know, I was born in 1945,

529
00:43:18.637 --> 00:43:22.516
but that night was
the moment of my conception.

530
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.727
- Right here in this room.
- Crowd's not here now.

531
00:43:25.811 --> 00:43:28.981
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

532
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:32.443
What a great story.

533
00:43:33.486 --> 00:43:37.531
I gotta tell the people in Culiacán
and Cartagena that story.

534
00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:54.005
You know the folks in Culiacán
and Cartagena?

535
00:43:54.089 --> 00:43:55.466
Afraid so.

536
00:43:57.259 --> 00:43:59.553
Man, just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

537
00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:03.265
I am a cool guy,
with a job I contracted to do.

538
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:05.642
Come on, Vincent, give the dude a pass.

539
00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:08.937
- I'm working here.
- You the one talking about improvisation.

540
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:12.399
You like the guy, you like how he plays.
Let's just play a little jazz. Come on.

541
00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:13.567
Improvi...

542
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:15.319
That's funny, coming from you.

543
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.244
How's this? I'll ask a question.

544
00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:27.122
- What question?
- A jazz question.

545
00:44:27.957 --> 00:44:30.459
Now, you get it right, we roll.

546
00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:34.004
You disappear tonight.

547
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.339
If I walk out of here tonight,

548
00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:40.427
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

549
00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.887
And one more thing.

550
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:44.890
These people and their rep here, Felix,

551
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:48.226
well, you tell them I'm sorry.

552
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:52.981
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

553
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:56.151
I was compelled.
It was either play ball or go back inside.

554
00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:59.363
And I'm not going back inside.

555
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.909
Yeah.

556
00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.998
Lay it on me.

557
00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:11.458
Where did Miles learn music?

558
00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.627
I know everything
there is to know about Miles.

559
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.128
Then let's have it.

560
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:18.340
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

561
00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:21.259
His father was a dentist, East St. Louis.

562
00:45:21.343 --> 00:45:23.261
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

563
00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:26.723
He sent Miles
to Juilliard School of Music,

564
00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:29.059
New York, 1945.

565
00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:30.436
Man.

566
00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:46.743
Dropped out of Juilliard
after less than a year.

567
00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:49.246
Tracked down Charlie Parker
on 52nd Street,

568
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.582
who mentored him for the next three years.

569
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:16.273
- Hey.
- No.

570
00:46:17.399 --> 00:46:20.277
- No, I'm done. Find you another cab.
- Max.

571
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:23.030
Leave me alone. I'm collateral anyway.

572
00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:31.580
I am not playing.

573
00:46:34.249 --> 00:46:35.960
You played him, man.

574
00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:41.382
If he got the answer right,
would you have let him go?

575
00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:47.971
<i>This is 102. This is 102. Max?</i>

576
00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:50.683
- What is it with this guy?
<i>- Max?</i>

577
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:03.612
- You hassling my driver again?
<i>- Who are you?</i>

578
00:47:03.696 --> 00:47:06.239
The same guy you talked to last time.

579
00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:09.743
<i>Max's mother's driving me crazy.
Put him on the line, please.</i>

580
00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:11.203
Hang on.

581
00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:13.664
Carefully.

582
00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:18.668
- Yeah.
<i>- Your mother's calling every 10 minutes.</i>

583
00:47:18.752 --> 00:47:21.129
<i>"Why didn't he show?"
"Are you all right?" "Where are you?"</i>

584
00:47:21.213 --> 00:47:22.798
Show for what?

585
00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.009
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

586
00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:28.470
<i>I'm not related to you.
You tell her yourself.</i>

587
00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:30.264
Show up for what?

588
00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:34.351
She's in the hospital.

589
00:47:34.435 --> 00:47:36.937
- You visit every night?
- Yeah. What difference does it make?

590
00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:39.356
- You don't show up, it breaks routine.
- So?

591
00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:43.652
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

592
00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:47.865
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

593
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:52.077
Since when was any of this negotiable?

594
00:47:58.584 --> 00:48:01.128
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

595
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:08.510
Hey. Flowers?

596
00:48:09.636 --> 00:48:12.036
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

597
00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:16.894
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

598
00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:23.525
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

599
00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:26.612
Excuse me. Keep the change.

600
00:48:38.123 --> 00:48:39.625
Hold that elevator, please.

601
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.588
- Floor?
- Five. Thanks.

602
00:48:56.517 --> 00:48:59.895
- Having a good night?
- <i>Mezzo mezzo.</i> You?

603
00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.614
Excuse me.

604
00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:45.941
Hey, Ma.

605
00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:51.613
- I've been calling and calling.
- Yeah, well, I got caught up at work.

606
00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:53.865
Why couldn't you call me on the telephone?

607
00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:56.785
I'm lying here wondering
if something terrible happened to you.

608
00:49:56.869 --> 00:49:58.161
I brought you flowers.

609
00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:00.622
- What am I gonna do with flowers?
- Cheer up.

610
00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:01.998
How?

611
00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:06.878
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just gonna wilt and die?

612
00:50:06.962 --> 00:50:08.422
See what I mean?

613
00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:10.924
I didn't buy you the flowers, Mom. He did.

614
00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.259
Who?

615
00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:20.017
Why didn't you tell me we had company?

616
00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:25.480
What's your name? Sorry. My son is rude.

617
00:50:25.564 --> 00:50:27.232
No harm done, ma'am.

618
00:50:27.941 --> 00:50:30.193
You paid for my flowers?

619
00:50:30.277 --> 00:50:32.321
They're beautiful.

620
00:50:40.621 --> 00:50:42.039
Well, Max?

621
00:50:45.834 --> 00:50:49.588
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

622
00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:55.051
I'm very happy to meet you, Mrs. Durocher.

623
00:50:55.135 --> 00:50:56.886
Oh, just call me Ida.

624
00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:01.015
Ida. I was with Max when he got the call.

625
00:51:01.099 --> 00:51:03.226
And you came all the way
over here to see me?

626
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.521
- It's nothing, ma'am.
- Tell my son.

627
00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:10.608
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

628
00:51:10.692 --> 00:51:14.154
You must be one of Max's
important clients.

629
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:17.866
Client? You know, I like
to think of myself as his friend.

630
00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:20.618
Max never had many friends.

631
00:51:20.702 --> 00:51:23.371
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It's unhealthy.

632
00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:26.040
Mom, how many times I got to ask you?
Please don't do that.

633
00:51:26.124 --> 00:51:27.208
Do what?

634
00:51:27.292 --> 00:51:30.378
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

635
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:31.754
What's he saying?

636
00:51:31.838 --> 00:51:35.425
He says he's standing right here,
in the room here.

637
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:37.094
Yes, you are.

638
00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.596
- He's sensitive.
- I know.

639
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.683
- But I'm sure you're very proud of him.
- Of course I'm proud.

640
00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:46.227
He started with nothing, you know.

641
00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:49.355
- Look at him today. Here, Vegas...
- Mom. Mom.

642
00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:52.650
Mom. Mom, he is not interested
in hearing about all that, okay?

643
00:51:52.734 --> 00:51:55.153
I came to see you. I saw you.
You look good. Let's go.

644
00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:58.656
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

645
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.618
- Limousine companies.
- Is that right?

646
00:52:01.702 --> 00:52:04.037
He drives famous people around.

647
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:08.458
Famous people. Limousine companies.
Now, that's quite an achievement.

648
00:52:08.542 --> 00:52:10.543
What did you say your name was again?

649
00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.546
My name is Vincent, ma'am.

650
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.883
- Visit again?
- No, I'm just in town tonight.

651
00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.844
- When you come back.
- Sure.

652
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.030
Max!

653
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:23.367
Don't!

654
00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:56.900
All of my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

655
00:54:02.322 --> 00:54:04.074
Let's see what else you can do.

656
00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:11.998
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

657
00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:19.339
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

658
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:26.512
No, next.

659
00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:29.682
Okay, you know, something's funny
about this, though, you know.

660
00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:34.103
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

661
00:54:34.187 --> 00:54:38.650
The kid and that last guy,
both done by the same shooter, I think.

662
00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:42.320
- Why do you say that?
- Wound pattern.

663
00:54:43.655 --> 00:54:46.240
Two in the sternum, one in the head.

664
00:54:46.324 --> 00:54:49.952
This guy, he's shooting tight groups too.
All right? Check this out.

665
00:54:50.036 --> 00:54:52.581
Double taps a couple millimeters apart.

666
00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:55.041
Let's see this one.

667
00:55:04.342 --> 00:55:06.261
See what I mean?

668
00:55:08.054 --> 00:55:11.016
- Holy shit. Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

669
00:55:17.522 --> 00:55:19.441
Come on, come on, wake up.

670
00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:36.416
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Fanning.

671
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.085
I'm still down here at the morgue
at Sisters of Charity.

672
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.336
Those John Does didn't pan out,

673
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.214
but you're never gonna guess
who I got here in the meat locker.

674
00:55:43.298 --> 00:55:45.508
- Who?
- Sylvester Clarke.

675
00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:47.642
Criminal attorney turned lawyer-criminal.

676
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:53.141
<i>Including Ramone, who he represented,
who's still missing.</i>

677
00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:56.375
The both of whom are in
the exotic-substances business together.

678
00:55:56.478 --> 00:56:00.231
There's something going on,
and I don't think the feds know about it.

679
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:03.443
Tell you what. Stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone.

680
00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.695
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.

681
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:06.947
Good.

682
00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:15.079
You're gonna go to a place
called El Rodeo.

683
00:56:15.163 --> 00:56:17.165
It's on Washington Boulevard
in Pico Rivera.

684
00:56:17.249 --> 00:56:20.001
- Where at on Washington?
- Look it up.

685
00:56:25.006 --> 00:56:26.466
Limos, huh?

686
00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:28.593
Don't start.

687
00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:31.512
I'm not the one lying to my mother.

688
00:56:31.596 --> 00:56:34.390
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

689
00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:36.601
Yeah, right.
Maybe she hears what you tell her.

690
00:56:36.685 --> 00:56:38.644
Whatever I tell her
is never good enough anyway.

691
00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:40.188
It's always been that way.

692
00:56:41.856 --> 00:56:44.859
- So what's at El Rodeo?
- Just drive.

693
00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:49.280
They project onto you their flaws.

694
00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:52.867
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

695
00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:55.161
They rank on you instead.

696
00:56:56.538 --> 00:56:59.583
- How do you know?
- I had a father like that.

697
00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:02.210
Mothers are worse.

698
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:04.962
Wouldn't know.
My mother died before I remember.

699
00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:06.631
What happened to your father?

700
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:09.843
Hated everything I did.

701
00:57:10.969 --> 00:57:15.432
Got drunk, beat me up. Foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

702
00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:19.769
Then what?

703
00:57:22.647 --> 00:57:23.648
I killed him.

704
00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.902
I was 12.

705
00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:37.162
I'm kidding.

706
00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:42.208
He died of liver disease.

707
00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:47.297
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

708
00:58:02.854 --> 00:58:06.691
What is this, driving a cab temporarily?
It's just all bullshit, huh?

709
00:58:06.775 --> 00:58:09.068
It is not bullshit.

710
00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:11.070
Twelve years isn't temporary, Max.

711
00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:14.865
Gotta get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

712
00:58:14.949 --> 00:58:16.742
Gotta staff up, get the right client list.

713
00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:19.912
It's not just simply get the car
and put asses in the seats.

714
00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.080
Why not?

715
00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:24.709
Because Island Limos
is more than just a ride.

716
00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:28.004
It's like a club experience. Cool groove.

717
00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:32.842
Don't want it to end.
It's gotta be perfect.

718
00:58:32.926 --> 00:58:33.926
Uh-huh.

719
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:35.303
Perfect.

720
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.015
It's up here. Turn right.

721
00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:03.205
- Give me your wallet. Come on.
- Give you my wallet. For what?

722
00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:07.209
I'll hold it for you in case
the people inside search you.

723
00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:10.004
- Who's searching?
- The people inside.

724
00:59:10.088 --> 00:59:12.798
Go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.

725
00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:14.008
- Felix.
- Yeah.

726
00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:16.594
- What does he look like?
- I don't know. I've never met him.

727
00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:18.220
Who is he?

728
00:59:18.304 --> 00:59:20.806
He's connected to the guys who hired me.

729
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.142
- I don't get it.
- You destroyed my workups.

730
00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:24.769
Number four's due.
What'd you think, night's over?

731
00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:26.896
Called on account of rain?

732
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.357
You go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

733
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:31.651
- They'll be on flash drive or CD.
- Me?

734
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:33.527
- How come you don't go?
- I don't meet people.

735
00:59:33.611 --> 00:59:35.196
Risk management. Anonymity.
I protect mine.

736
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.697
You're not gonna screw that up.

737
00:59:36.781 --> 00:59:39.825
I got a contract with their bosses.
These guys don't get to meet me.

738
00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.559
They don't know what I look like.

739
00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:46.624
If I don't pull it off, then...

740
00:59:46.708 --> 00:59:49.210
They will kill you.
Now, you got 10 minutes.

741
00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:50.961
At 10:01, I drive to the hospital

742
00:59:51.045 --> 00:59:52.838
and execute your mother
on my way out of town.

743
00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:55.966
- And don't pretend indifference.
- I can't do this.

744
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.677
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

745
00:59:57.761 --> 00:59:59.762
Sure you can, man. Come on. Hey. Hey.

746
00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:03.349
Look, man, if I do this, I'm just gonna
end up getting other people killed.

747
01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.475
Out of options, Max.

748
01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:08.062
Just take comfort in knowing
you never had a choice.

749
01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.565
- How long you been doing this?
- Why?

750
01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:13.234
Just in case they ask me.

751
01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:18.030
- Private sector, six years.
- Okay. All right, six years.

752
01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:22.576
You get benefits?
Or, you know, like, insurance? Pension?

753
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.456
No. No paid sick leave. Quit stalling.
Get out of the cab.

754
01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.611
- Yeah? Hold up.
- Hold on, man.

755
01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:05.995
Who is this?

756
01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.293
Mark the time.

757
01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.551
All right, it's cool.

758
01:01:24.138 --> 01:01:26.891
- What's up, homes?
- Hey. What's up?

759
01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:30.853
I'm here to see Felix.
He has something for me.

760
01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.814
Don't know no Felix.

761
01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:38.570
Tell him...

762
01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:44.075
Say it's Vincent.

763
01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.452
I'm Vincent.

764
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.509
Copy.

765
01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.763
Let him in. Let him in right now.
Go ahead.

766
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:39.755
Detective Richard Weidner, LAPD,
Major Narcotics Division.

767
01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.716
- Detective Ray Fanning, LAPD...
- Yeah. Hi. Okay. How are you?

768
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.343
Agent Frank Pedrosa.

769
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.053
- Good. Thanks for seeing us.
- You're welcome.

770
01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:48.973
How can I help? What's up?
Why do you wanna know about our case?

771
01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:51.892
- Any unusual activity tonight?
- Like what?

772
01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:54.228
That relates to a murder
or a series of murders

773
01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.212
in Wilshire Central or West Hollywood?

774
01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:59.567
All quiet on the western front.

775
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:02.361
Various people are asleep.
Various people are not.

776
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.031
They come and go in cars, pickups, taxis.

777
01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:08.326
Other than that, we watch air move.

778
01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:12.037
- Your interest in our case?
- Well, our interest...

779
01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.998
We got a situation. Two bodies.

780
01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.750
Could be a coincidence,
could not be a coincidence.

781
01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:19.884
It doesn't look like one.
We got an attorney and his client...

782
01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:22.038
Roof's all beat to shit.

783
01:03:23.424 --> 01:03:25.593
Roof's all beat to shit.

784
01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.555
- Can you zoom in on this, please?
- On what?

785
01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.974
On that.

786
01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.356
- Look at that right there.
- What is it?

787
01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:46.822
Yeah. 5-Queen-49974.

788
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.367
5Q49974.

789
01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:47.216
I thought you'd be taller.

790
01:04:50.928 --> 01:04:52.555
So, Vincent.

791
01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.936
- What are the two names?
- Ramone Ayala and Clarke.

792
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.522
Are you telling me Ramone Ayala
and Clarke were murdered tonight?

793
01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.732
- Both killed?
- Sylvester Clarke for sure.

794
01:05:03.816 --> 01:05:05.859
- Ramone, I don't know.
- I got another DOA.

795
01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:08.529
Daniel Baker out of South Central,
Leimert Park.

796
01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:09.822
That's three.

797
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.282
- Three what?
- Witnesses.

798
01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:15.869
Vincent meet their people

799
01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:18.998
in Culiacán or Cartagena.

800
01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.418
But he don't meet you. Okay.

801
01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:25.963
Now you're here.

802
01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.509
Why?

803
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.388
I lost my stuff.

804
01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.475
The list.

805
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:43.022
I want you to listen to me real well.

806
01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.484
Special groups put together
the list of <i>dedos.</i>

807
01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:50.238
<i>- Dedos?</i>
- Fingers. Informants.

808
01:05:51.697 --> 01:05:56.077
Signal interceptions with
voice-recognition software, surveillance.

809
01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.748
A very expensive counterintelligence
worked up that list.

810
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:04.127
An important list. Wouldn't you say?

811
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.588
And you lost it?

812
01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.842
Yeah.

813
01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.344
I'm sorry.

814
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.847
Sorry.

815
01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:18.974
"Sorry"?

816
01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:22.103
"Sorry" does not put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

817
01:06:25.022 --> 01:06:27.816
- Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
- No.

818
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.694
- Do you believe in Santa Claus?
- No.

819
01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.613
Nor do I.

820
01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.657
Nor do I, but my children do.
They are still small.

821
01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:40.288
But do you know who they like even
better than Santa Claus? His helper.

822
01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:44.917
Pedro el Negro. Black Peter. Yeah.

823
01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:47.712
There's an old Mexican tale

824
01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:52.758
that tells of how Santa Claus got so very
busy looking out for the good children

825
01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:56.512
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.

826
01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.555
So he hired Pedro.

827
01:06:58.639 --> 01:07:00.599
And Santa Claus gave him a list

828
01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:04.144
with all the names
of all the bad children.

829
01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:07.064
And Pedro would come every night
to check them out.

830
01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:10.400
And the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,

831
01:07:10.484 --> 01:07:12.736
that were not saying their prayers,

832
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:17.449
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows.

833
01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.284
A little burro.

834
01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:21.245
And he would come back.

835
01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.247
And if the children
were still misbehaving,

836
01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.625
Pedro would take them away
and nobody would ever see them again.

837
01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:32.089
Now, if I am being Santa Claus,
and you are Pedro,

838
01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:35.968
how do you think
jolly old Santa Claus would feel

839
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:39.513
if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, "I lost the list"?

840
01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:42.683
How fucking furious
do you think he would get?

841
01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.019
Tell me, Vincent.

842
01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.980
Tell me what you think.

843
01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:51.776
What?

844
01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.113
I think...

845
01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:03.412
I think you should tell the guy behind me

846
01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:06.332
to put that gun down.

847
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.793
What did you say?

848
01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:12.713
I said, I think you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away

849
01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:16.092
before I take it
and beat his bitch ass to death with it.

850
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.104
I picked up a tail.

851
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.315
- Federal?
- I don't know. You tell me.

852
01:08:33.317 --> 01:08:35.152
That's why I tossed the list.

853
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.572
The workups, all of that shit.

854
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:41.909
To protect, in part, your...

855
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:46.163
Hermès, Façonnable ass.

856
01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:53.546
What, you think I like coming in here?

857
01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:59.010
But, hey, shit happens.

858
01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:01.971
Gotta roll with it. Adapt.

859
01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:04.807
Darwin. <i>I Ching.</i>

860
01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:07.893
Has...

861
01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.730
The fat man. The penthouse guy.
The jazz man.

862
01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:14.191
That leaves two.

863
01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:24.994
Can you finish?

864
01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:27.663
In six years...

865
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:32.709
when have I not?

866
01:09:32.793 --> 01:09:34.378
<i>Say it's Vincent.</i>

867
01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:36.589
<i>I'm Vincent.</i>

868
01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.758
<i>Say it's Vincent.</i>

869
01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:40.676
<i>I'm Vincent.</i>

870
01:09:41.552 --> 01:09:43.137
<i>Say it's Vincent.</i>

871
01:09:44.388 --> 01:09:45.598
<i>I'm Vincent.</i>

872
01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:48.225
<i>- Say it's Vincent.</i>
- Vincent?

873
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:51.228
- That's what I'm hearing.
<i>- I'm Vincent.</i>

874
01:10:14.418 --> 01:10:16.003
Your last two.

875
01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:23.468
And by the way,
as a token of my appreciation,

876
01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.513
I would like to offer you a discount.

877
01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:30.559
For all my services, 25%.

878
01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.397
- Very generous.
- Hell, make it 35.

879
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.275
And, by the way...

880
01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:42.863
Daniel said he was sorry.

881
01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.328
Interesting.

882
01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.661
E-mail me his license.

883
01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:32.997
- Right.
- To my cell phone.

884
01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:34.623
No, no, I'll wait.

885
01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.376
Hey, is there anybody else in that cab?

886
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.660
Vegas odds would've been
against you walking out of there.

887
01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:59.106
Yeah, very impressive.

888
01:12:02.776 --> 01:12:05.476
6th Street by Alexandria.
A club called Fever. Know it?

889
01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:19.709
Locate our witness, Peter Lim.
Get him evacuated, get him safe.

890
01:12:19.793 --> 01:12:22.045
- LA 101 to chase units.
- Yeah.

891
01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:23.964
African-American, medium build.

892
01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:26.133
The assault team will do the takedown.

893
01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:27.843
- Are you sure?
- Do not spook him before.

894
01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:30.178
I want air support up
and to maintain at 1,500 feet.

895
01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:31.388
Thank you.

896
01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:39.021
- How long?
- Twelve minutes.

897
01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.648
According to
the cab company's dispatch unit,

898
01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:43.859
this guy's been driving that cab
for 12 years.

899
01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:44.943
So what?

900
01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.655
So you're telling me the guy
walks into a phone booth and, shazam,

901
01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.907
changes into a meat-eater super-assassin?

902
01:12:50.991 --> 01:12:53.243
What's he do,
squeeze them in between fares?

903
01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.745
No, the real cabdriver
is floating down a storm drain.

904
01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.914
The guy who walked out of there
looks like this guy.

905
01:12:57.998 --> 01:12:59.875
'Cause he picked a cabdriver
who looks like him.

906
01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:03.587
- Yeah, I don't know.
- I do. Zee?

907
01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:06.840
We see private-sector security companies
hiring out to cartels

908
01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.967
in Colombia, Russia, Mexico,

909
01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:13.930
hiring ex-Special Forces, Stasi,
ex-KGB, like that, all the time.

910
01:13:14.014 --> 01:13:17.893
Guys with trigger time, skill sets, real
tradecraft, like, look like a cabdriver.

911
01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:19.853
What are you gonna do?

912
01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:22.439
Take his ass down. Save our witness.

913
01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:29.905
What if these guys are wrong?

914
01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:32.491
They got the guy admitting
his name is Vincent.

915
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.494
- He's in there talking to the bad guys.
- There is something else going on.

916
01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:39.080
Ray, there's nothing else going on.
I thought there was. There isn't.

917
01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:41.833
It's their ball. It's their game.
There's nothing in it for us.

918
01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.835
- There's nothing in it for you.
- That's right.

919
01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:46.922
It's late. I'm going home.
You know what time it is?

920
01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.107
They locate Peter Lim yet?

921
01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.733
Sheila's on with the wife.
She thinks he's at Fever.

922
01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.485
6th and Alexandria. Move it.

923
01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:54.531
LA 101 to LA 103, LA 105, LA 108.

924
01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.242
Witness is in a club called Fever,
6th and Alexandria.

925
01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.660
That's where Vincent is going.

926
01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:01.204
<i>Assault team and remaining units,
you will take Vincent.</i>

927
01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:04.541
<i>First unit on the scene will get
the witness, Peter Lim. Get him out.</i>

928
01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:07.920
LA 105 to LA 101. Copy that.

929
01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:45.248
- You gonna call her?
- Who?

930
01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:48.293
Your lady friend,
the one who gave you her business card.

931
01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:50.629
I don't know.

932
01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:53.298
- Maybe, maybe not.
- What?

933
01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:55.926
Pick up the phone.

934
01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:59.888
Life's short. One day, it's gone.

935
01:16:05.018 --> 01:16:07.818
You and I make it out of this alive,
you should call her.

936
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:11.024
That's what I think.

937
01:16:13.193 --> 01:16:14.528
Anyway...

938
01:17:57.631 --> 01:17:59.466
There he is. Hit it.

939
01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.541
Let's do it.

940
01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:44.094
Table towards the back is where he hangs.

941
01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.276
Wilke, take the right.
Brian, hold the door.

942
01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.946
Clean shots. Watch your backs.
Watch your backs.

943
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:04.323
LAPD.

944
01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.629
Go 15 feet ahead, three feet to the left.

945
01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:04.463
Wander, innocent bystanders
get the first rounds. Clear?

946
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.860
There's Lim. Second booth from the left.
Get him out of here.

947
01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:02.959
Middle of the dance floor.
Freeze, Vincent!

948
01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:07.130
FBI! FBI! Get your hands in the air!
Get your hands in the air, Vincent!

949
01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:10.425
- Freeze! Get your hands up!
- FBI. Where's Peter Lim?

950
01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:12.427
FBI! Get your hands in the air!

951
01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:14.971
Drop it!

952
01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.391
- Freeze!
- Freeze! FBI!

953
01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.310
- I'm not Vincent.
- FBI!

954
01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.480
Put the gun down! You got the wrong...

955
01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:57.597
Pedrosa's been shot. Get an RA unit.

956
01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.117
No! Wait, wait!

957
01:23:49.649 --> 01:23:51.818
Hold on. Hold on. I'm Detective Fanning.

958
01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:53.027
I'm Max! I'm Max!

959
01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:55.321
I'm a goddamn cabdriver, man!

960
01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:58.116
I know. I'm getting you out of here.
I'm LAPD. Come on.

961
01:24:36.696 --> 01:24:38.531
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay.

962
01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:40.575
Just move it. Keep moving.

963
01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.127
You're okay.

964
01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:54.395
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. You're okay.

965
01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:57.175
You're okay. You're all right.

966
01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:08.019
Let's go!

967
01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:11.898
Let's go.

968
01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:21.992
Go! Drive! Drive!

969
01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:03.158
Only thing that didn't show up
is the Polish cavalry.

970
01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.369
You're alive.

971
01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:07.704
I saved you.

972
01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:14.336
Do I get any thanks? No.
All you can do is clam up.

973
01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:19.966
You wanna talk? Want me to fuck off?

974
01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:21.051
Fuck off.

975
01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:27.139
- You had to kill Fanning?
- Who the fuck is Fanning?

976
01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:29.017
Fanning. The cop.

977
01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:32.687
Why'd you have to kill him?

978
01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:35.571
He's probably got family.
Kids gonna grow up without him.

979
01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:37.650
He believed me.

980
01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:40.903
I should've saved him
because he believed you.

981
01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:42.113
- Not that.
- Yeah. That.

982
01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:43.948
Well, yeah, that. What's wrong with that?

983
01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.284
- It's what I do for a living.
- Some living.

984
01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:48.577
- Head downtown.
- What's downtown?

985
01:26:48.661 --> 01:26:52.582
How are you at math?
I was hired for five hits. I did four.

986
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:57.170
Why not just kill me
and get another cabdriver?

987
01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:00.965
Because you're good.
We're in this together.

988
01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.801
Fates intertwined.
Cosmic coincidence. You know.

989
01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.053
- You full of shit.
- All that crap. I'm full of shit?

990
01:27:06.137 --> 01:27:08.139
You're a monument of it.
You even bullshitted yourself.

991
01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.433
"All I am is taking out the garbage,
killing bad people."

992
01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:13.103
- Well, that's what you said.
- You believed me?

993
01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:17.940
- Then what'd they do?
- How do I know? You know?

994
01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.442
They all got that

995
01:27:20.443 --> 01:27:23.321
"witness for the prosecution" look to me.

996
01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:25.489
Probably some major
federal indictment of somebody

997
01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.659
who majorly does not wanna get indicted.

998
01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:29.994
So that's the reason?

999
01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.039
That's the why. There's no reason.

1000
01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:36.273
There's no good reason,
there's no bad reason to live or to die.

1001
01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:38.586
Then what are you?

1002
01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:40.463
Indifferent.

1003
01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:44.884
Get with it.

1004
01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:47.219
Millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars

1005
01:27:47.303 --> 01:27:49.889
and a speck on one in a blink.

1006
01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:52.600
That's us. Lost in space.

1007
01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:56.521
The cop, you, me... who notices?

1008
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.407
What's with you?

1009
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:09.951
As in?

1010
01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:13.454
As in, if somebody had a gun
to your head and said,

1011
01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:16.123
"You gotta tell me what's going on
with this person over here

1012
01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:17.625
or I'm gonna kill you.

1013
01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:23.089
What is driving him?
What was he thinking?"

1014
01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:25.223
You couldn't do it, could you? Because...

1015
01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:27.510
They would have to kill your ass,

1016
01:28:27.594 --> 01:28:31.514
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.

1017
01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:35.477
I think you're low, my brother. Way low.

1018
01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:41.315
Like, what were you? One of those
institutionalized-raised guys?

1019
01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:43.317
Anybody home?

1020
01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.778
And... And the standard parts

1021
01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:50.074
that are supposed to be there
in people, in you, aren't.

1022
01:28:55.371 --> 01:28:57.373
And why haven't you killed me yet?

1023
01:29:01.252 --> 01:29:05.423
Of all the cabbies in LA, I get Max...
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.

1024
01:29:06.382 --> 01:29:08.259
Answer the question.

1025
01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:11.346
Look in the mirror.

1026
01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:16.100
Paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.

1027
01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:19.395
- How much you got saved?
- That ain't none of your business.

1028
01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:22.648
Someday? "Someday my dream will come"?

1029
01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:26.110
One night you'll wake up,
and you'll discover it never happened.

1030
01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.112
It's all turned around on you.

1031
01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.657
It never will. Suddenly you are old.

1032
01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.451
Didn't happen.

1033
01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:36.579
And it never will, because you
were never gonna do it anyway.

1034
01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:39.790
You'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your Barcalounger,

1035
01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:44.295
being hypnotized by daytime TV
for the rest of your life.

1036
01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.255
Don't you talk to me about murder.

1037
01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:50.509
All it ever took was a down payment
on a Lincoln Town Car.

1038
01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:53.263
Or that girl.
You can't even call that girl.

1039
01:29:54.597 --> 01:29:57.517
What the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?

1040
01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:19.038
Because I never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?

1041
01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:21.708
Myself. I should have.

1042
01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:25.544
I've tried to gamble my way
out from under,

1043
01:30:25.628 --> 01:30:28.672
but that was just a born-to-lose deal.

1044
01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.883
- Slow down.
- It's gotta be perfect.

1045
01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:34.596
It's got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.

1046
01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:39.475
I could've done it anytime I wanted to.

1047
01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:40.685
Red light.

1048
01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:49.777
But you know what? New news.

1049
01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.447
It doesn't matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?

1050
01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:57.243
We're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.

1051
01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:58.661
<i>Twilight Zone</i> shit.

1052
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.836
Says the badass sociopath in my back seat.

1053
01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:15.177
But you know what? That's the one thing
I gotta thank you for, bro.

1054
01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:17.889
Because until now,
I never looked at it that way.

1055
01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:24.145
What does it matter?
It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.

1056
01:31:24.937 --> 01:31:26.787
What do we got to lose anyway, right?

1057
01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:30.234
- Slow down.
- Why? You gonna shoot me?

1058
01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:31.819
You gonna pull the trigger and kill us?

1059
01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:33.737
- Go ahead, shoot my ass.
- Slow the hell down.

1060
01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:36.782
You gonna shoot me? You gonna
shoot me now? You gonna kill us?

1061
01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:39.451
Well, shoot my ass, then. Shoot me.

1062
01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:41.287
- Slow down!
- You're right.

1063
01:31:43.122 --> 01:31:44.457
You know what, Vincent?

1064
01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.085
Go fuck yourself.

1065
01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:23.037
- Well, that was brilliant.
- Didn't have your seat belt on?

1066
01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:04.620
1 -L-20, show me code 6
at Olympic and Figueroa

1067
01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:06.038
on the TC with injuries.

1068
01:33:06.539 --> 01:33:10.209
<i>- Copy your location.</i>
- Sir, are you okay? What happened?

1069
01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.879
Sir, you were involved in an accident.

1070
01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:16.298
An ambulance is on its way to help you.

1071
01:33:16.382 --> 01:33:19.532
You understand what I'm saying to you?
Sit down and relax, okay?

1072
01:33:22.054 --> 01:33:25.975
Okay. Don't worry about the cab.
They'll get you a new one.

1073
01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:29.604
Relax and breathe.

1074
01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:45.411
Put your hands up.

1075
01:33:45.495 --> 01:33:48.789
Put your hands up. Face the cab.
Get down on your knees.

1076
01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:51.291
- Go ahead and arrest me.
- Put your hands on top of your head.

1077
01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:54.125
- Take me to jail. LA County jail's great.
- Don't move!

1078
01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:56.756
Put your hands behind your head.

1079
01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:04.472
1 -L-20, I need a backup on a 187 suspect.

1080
01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:19.862
- Put your gun down!
- Get back! Put your hands down!

1081
01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:21.530
- Look, I gotta go.
- Put down the gun!

1082
01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:24.074
Stop moving! Stop moving!

1083
01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.285
When did this become a negotiation?

1084
01:34:28.704 --> 01:34:30.914
Clap your hands together.
Hold your hands together.

1085
01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:34.501
Listen, somebody's gonna get killed
if I don't go right now.

1086
01:34:34.585 --> 01:34:35.837
Cuff yourself.

1087
01:34:36.712 --> 01:34:39.090
I'm going to 6th and Fig. Call the cops.

1088
01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:58.275
Give me that.

1089
01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:59.735
Hey, hey... Fuck!

1090
01:35:28.264 --> 01:35:29.599
Come on!

1091
01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:01.672
Come on. Go through.

1092
01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:06.010
Come on. Come on. Pick up.

1093
01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:25.738
Pick up.

1094
01:36:27.406 --> 01:36:28.449
Come on, girl.

1095
01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:31.452
Come on, pick up.

1096
01:36:55.559 --> 01:36:56.727
US Attorney's Office.

1097
01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.145
- Annie!
<i>- Yes.</i>

1098
01:36:58.229 --> 01:37:02.107
It's Max. Max, the cabdriver.
Listen to me, all right?

1099
01:37:02.191 --> 01:37:03.901
<i>- A guy named Vincent...</i>
- Max.

1100
01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:05.653
<i>Listen to me, Annie.</i>

1101
01:37:06.988 --> 01:37:09.865
- It's a strange time to be calling.
<i>- Listen. Listen, Annie.</i>

1102
01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:13.327
There's a man named Vincent.
He's coming to kill you.

1103
01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:17.664
- He's what?
- Kill you! He's coming to kill you!

1104
01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:20.292
<i>He was scoping out the building
when I dropped you off...</i>

1105
01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:24.796
Okay, Max, if this is supposed to be
some type of joke, it's not funny.

1106
01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.049
It's not a joke.
Annie, listen to me, please.

1107
01:37:27.133 --> 01:37:31.303
Felix hired him. Okay?
Or people that Felix worked for.

1108
01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:34.014
Felix Reyes-Torrena.
How do you know about my case?

1109
01:37:34.098 --> 01:37:35.807
I don't understand what's going on.

1110
01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:39.541
All I know is that he's already killed
witnesses. He's coming to kill you.

1111
01:37:40.312 --> 01:37:43.662
When I dropped you off, I don't know how,
but he ended up in my cab.

1112
01:38:04.045 --> 01:38:05.379
<i>Annie.</i>

1113
01:38:06.088 --> 01:38:08.299
<i>Listen. All I want you to do...</i>

1114
01:38:16.682 --> 01:38:18.976
<i>- I don't understand what's going on.</i>
- Annie, listen.

1115
01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.160
<i>- Max.</i>
- Please listen.

1116
01:38:42.291 --> 01:38:44.960
Get out of the building. Annie.

1117
01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:52.123
<i>- Okay, I'm leaving the building right now.</i>
- No, wait.

1118
01:38:52.927 --> 01:38:54.678
- Max.
<i>- Wait, wait.</i>

1119
01:38:56.889 --> 01:38:59.433
- Max.
<i>- Where are you right now? What floor?</i>

1120
01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:02.144
I'm on the 16th floor
in the law library and files.

1121
01:39:03.145 --> 01:39:06.815
- He's two floors below you, corner office.
- In my office?

1122
01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:09.901
<i>Listen, he does not know you're up there.
Just stay right there and call 911.</i>

1123
01:39:09.985 --> 01:39:11.737
Are you sure he's on the 14th floor?

1124
01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:14.532
Listen, just stay there
and just call the police.

1125
01:39:15.991 --> 01:39:17.785
- Max?
<i>- Annie...</i>

1126
01:39:20.663 --> 01:39:21.580
Shit.

1127
01:39:29.088 --> 01:39:30.297
Max?

1128
01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.055
Shit.

1129
01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:46.230
- Max.
- He knows you're up there. Just...

1130
01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.690
I can't hear you. Hello?

1131
01:39:48.774 --> 01:39:50.985
Annie. Annie, listen to me.

1132
01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:52.987
Shit.

1133
01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:57.658
Annie. Annie!

1134
01:39:59.743 --> 01:40:00.953
Shit.

1135
01:40:57.635 --> 01:40:58.844
<i>911. Operator.</i>

1136
01:40:58.928 --> 01:41:01.678
Yes. Listen, there is a man
in my building, and he is...

1137
01:41:06.352 --> 01:41:08.020
Hello?

1138
01:44:16.792 --> 01:44:18.585
Let her go.

1139
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:19.753
Max?

1140
01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:24.758
Why? What are you gonna do about it?

1141
01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:30.389
Come on.

1142
01:44:43.485 --> 01:44:44.570
Max!

1143
01:45:04.214 --> 01:45:06.800
Oh, God. Felix Reyes-Torrena?

1144
01:45:06.884 --> 01:45:08.551
Yeah. I met him.

1145
01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:10.553
What do you mean, you met him? How?

1146
01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:14.182
I don't know. Look, when
I dropped you off, there was a fare.

1147
01:45:14.266 --> 01:45:16.266
- He said his name is Vincent.
- Vincent?

1148
01:45:23.233 --> 01:45:26.069
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- This is the street.

1149
01:45:27.446 --> 01:45:29.239
This way. Come on.

1150
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.851
This way. Come on.

1151
01:45:58.352 --> 01:46:00.019
Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.

1152
01:46:00.103 --> 01:46:02.564
- What we gonna do?
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1153
01:46:03.315 --> 01:46:05.025
No, no. This way.

1154
01:46:28.006 --> 01:46:29.383
Wait, wait. Wait. Wait.

1155
01:46:53.615 --> 01:46:54.741
Stay down.

1156
01:47:43.248 --> 01:47:44.416
Shit.

1157
01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:54.134
There's a station.

1158
01:48:34.883 --> 01:48:36.259
Shit.

1159
01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:12.170
Max!

1160
01:49:14.756 --> 01:49:16.091
I do this for a living!

1161
01:50:27.746 --> 01:50:29.247
We're almost

1162
01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:32.250
at the next stop.

1163
01:50:34.252 --> 01:50:35.587
Hey, Max.

1164
01:50:39.382 --> 01:50:42.719
A guy gets on the MTA here in LA and dies.

1165
01:50:48.433 --> 01:50:50.602
Think anybody will notice?

1166
01:51:49.786 --> 01:51:50.871
Come on.
