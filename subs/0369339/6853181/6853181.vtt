00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.059
Hey.

178
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:19.067
[Max] Oh, whoa, whoa!
Hey, yeah. Come on, man, I'm sorry.

179
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.820
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.
I'll take you.

180
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.908
[engine starts]

181
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.579
-Where to?
-1039 South Union Street.

182
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.539
Gotcha.

183
00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.974
-[man] How long you think this'll take?
-[Max] Seven minutes.

184
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:55.269
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

185
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.022
Two minutes to get across
the 110 to Normandie.

186
00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.607
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

187
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.276
Over to Union is one.
Plus one for "shit happens."

188
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.278
-[man] Okay if I time you?
-Knock yourself out.

189
00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.114
[man] What do I get if you‘re wrong?
A free ride?

190
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.991
You get an apology.
I already offered my free ride today.

191
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.785
-[man] To who?
-Some girl.

192
00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.288
[man] Did you get a date with her?

193
00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.749
First time in LA?

194
00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.878
No. Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here,
I can't wait to leave.

195
00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:25.216
You know, it's...
too sprawled out, disconnected. You know?

196
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:28.302
-That‘s me. You like it?
-It’s my home.

197
00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:29.595
[man] Seventeen million people.

198
00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.848
This was a country, it'd be
the fifth biggest economy in the world,

199
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.100
and nobody knows each other.

200
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:37.562
I read about this guy,
gets on the MTA here, dies.

201
00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.523
-[Max] Oh.
-Six hours he's riding the subway

202
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.568
before anybody notices his corpse
doing laps around LA.

203
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.570
People on and off sitting next to him.

204
00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.197
Nobody notices.

205
00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.872
This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

206
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:59.834
-Regular ride?
-Yeah. I share it with the day-shift guy.

207
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.419
[man] Because you prefer nights?

208
00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:04.881
Yeah. People are more relaxed.
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

209
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.466
How are the benefits?

210
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.050
Oh, no. It‘s not that kind of job.

211
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.888
I'm not in this for the long haul.
I‘m just filling in, you know.

212
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.348
Just temporary while I'm getting
some things shaped up.

213
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:15.850
This is just temporary.

214
00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.977
-[man] How long you been driving?
-Twelve years.

215
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.104
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

216
00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.315
What other things you putting together?

217
00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.775
Uh...

218
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.575
No, I don't wanna talk about it.
Just a little business plan.

219
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.703
-No offense. I just...
-None taken.

220
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.373
You're one of these guys
that do instead of talk.

221
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.042
That's cool.

222
00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.594
Seven minutes. Man, you‘re good.

223
00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.137
Ah, I got lucky with the lights.

224
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:56.224
Yeah, sure. You probably know
the light schedules, too.

225
00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.350
[beeps]

226
00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:01.395
Listen, I'm in town on a real-estate deal.
Close in one night.

227
00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:04.732
I got five stops to make.
Collect signatures, see some friends.

228
00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:08.444
And then I got a 6:00 am. out of LAX.
Why don't you hang with me?

229
00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.655
The car's not for hire, man.
That's against regs.

230
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.156
Regulations?
-Yeah.

231
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.242
[chuckles] These guys
don't pay you sick leave.

232
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:15.743
How much you pull down a shift?

233
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.620
-Uh...
-How much?

234
00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.121
350, 400.

235
00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.375
Yeah? Well, let me tell you what.
I'll make it 600.

236
00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.920
Uh, man, I don't know.

237
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:28.506
Plus an extra hundred, you get me to LAX
and I don't have to run for the plane.

238
00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:30.508
I-- I don't know about this.

239
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:32.343
-I don't know.
-Yeah, you do.

240
00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.679
-I don't know, man.
-Yeah, you do.

241
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.764
-Six hundred...
-Cool. We got a deal.

242
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.975
Here‘s 300 down. What's your name?

243
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.935
-Max.
-Max.

244
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:42.979
-I‘m Vincent.
-All right.

245
00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.360
[Max] I can't
stay double-parked here, though.

246
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.945
I'll meet you in the alley
behind the building.

247
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.363
[Max] All right.

248
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.381
[scoffs] Definitely not from around here.

249

250
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.694

Oh, no! Shit! Fuck! No.

Oh, shit. Fuck. [panting]

257
00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.675
Hey. He-- H-He fell on the cab.

258
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.595
He fell-- He fell from up there
on the motherfucking cab.

259
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.848
-Shit. I think he's dead.
-[Vincent] Good guess.

260
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.934
[panting]

261
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.274
You killed him?

262
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:55.361
No, I shot him.
Bullets and the fall killed him.

263
00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.906
Oh, man. Fuck this, man.

264
00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:01.909
-[Vincent] Red light, Max.
-Hold on. Hold on.

265
00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:04.912
Put your hands down.

266
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.873
-Put your hands down.
-Okay. Okay.

267
00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:13.796
Okay, help me out. Pop the trunk.

268
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.716
-What?
-Pop the trunk.

269
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:22.054
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.
What you doing?

270
00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:24.140
-I'm gonna roll him off the roof.
-Huh?

271
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.851
Can't leave him here.
So unless you want him up front with you.

272
00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:28.144
But given the hygiene...

273
00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.438
-Oh, shit.
-Okay.

274
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.106
It‘s only a dead guy.

275
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.066
Grab his hands.

276
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.486
-I can't do this.
-Grab his wrists.

277
00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:41.741
[both grunt]

278
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:44.660
-You got it?
-Yeah. He's twitching and shit.

279
00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.582
[grunting] Fuck.

281
00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.721
Okay. That's good enough.

282
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.060
Let's go.

283
00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.896
Hey, why don't you just take the cab?

284
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.898
-Take the cab?
-Yeah, you take it.

285
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.942
I'II-- I'll chill. I'll just chill.

286
00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:19.278
They don't even know who's driving
these things half the time anyway.

287
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.239
They never check or anything.
Okay? So just take it.

288
00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.324
You, me...

289
00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.284
You promise not to tell anybody, right?

290
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.911
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-Right?

291
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:29.455
Promise.

292
00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.290
Get in the fucking car.

293
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.501

Send two black-and-whites
and a night detective to 1039 South Union.

307
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:14.161
And contact SID. I got a crime scene.

So? Lady Macbeth, we're sitting here,
and the Iight‘s green.

You no longer have
the cleanest cab in Ia-Ia land.

You gotta live with that.
You focus on the job. Drive.

I don't know, man, 17 minutes.

320
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.627
Why?

321

Oh, no. No, no. Hold on, man.

322
00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:08.048
Now, I told you
we had other stops to make tonight.

[Max] No, you said
you had to go visit some friends.

-Well, they're somebody's friends.
-No.

you might make it through the night,
come out 700 bucks ahead.

I'm not trying to piss you off
or nothing like that, but I can't do this.

I can‘t drive you around
while you go around killing people, man.

-You're stressed. I understand that.

00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:56.096
You were gonna drive me around tonight
and never be the wiser,

340
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.516
but <i>el gordo</i> got in front of a window,
did his high dive...

341
00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:02.895
We‘re into plan B. You still breathing?

342
00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:07.191
We gotta make the best of it.
Improvise. Adapt to the environment.

343
00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:10.986
Darwin. Shit happens. <i>I Ching.</i>
Whatever, man. We gotta roll with it.

344
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.781
<i>I Ching.</i> What are you talking about, man?
You threw a man out of a window.

345
00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:15.866
I didn't throw him. He fell.

346
00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.077
Well, what did he do to you?

347
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.997
-What?
-What did he do to you?

348
00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:24.083
Nothing. I only met him tonight.

349
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:26.293
You just met him once,
and you kill him like that?

350
00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:29.379
What, I should only kill people
after I get to know them?

351
00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:30.631
No, man.

352
00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.883
Max, six billion people on the planet,

353
00:26:32.966 --> 00:26:34.927
you're getting bent out of shape
because of one fat guy.

354
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.804
Well, who was he?

355
00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:39.515
What do you care?
Have you ever heard of Rwanda?

356
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:40.933
Yes, I know Rwanda.

357
00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:43.310
Well, tens of thousands
killed before sundown.

358
00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:46.563
Nobody's killed people that fast
since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

359
00:26:46.647 --> 00:26:48.232
-Did you bat an eye, Max?
-What?

360
00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:51.318
Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam,

361
00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:54.154
Save the Whales,
Greenpeace or something? No.

362
00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:57.074
I off one fat Angeleno,
and you throw a hissy fit.

363
00:26:57.157 --> 00:26:58.826
Man, I don't know any Rwandans.

364
00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.369
You don't know the guy
in the trunk either.

365
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:02.746
Man.

366
00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:06.708
Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
he was a criminal

367
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:09.086
involved in a continuing
criminal enterprise.

368
00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:11.672
What are you doing,
you just taking out the garbage?

369
00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:13.423
-Yeah. Something like that.
-[sirens blaring]

370
00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:15.425
-[police officer] <i>Pullover to the right.</i>
-Shit.

371
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.681
-[Vincent] Get rid of them.
-[Max] How?

372
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:23.183
[Vincent] You're a cabbie.
Talk yourself out of a ticket.

373
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:30.065
Just, please, man, don‘t do anything.

374
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:33.235
Then don't let me get cornered.
You don't have the trunk space.

375
00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.611
I can't believe this.

376
00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:36.989
-[Vincent] Believe it.
-Don't. I'll talk to them.

377
00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:39.491
[police radio chatter]

378
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:41.994
He's probably married.

379
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.540
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife‘s pregnant.

380
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:50.752
Yeah, I'll take care of it. I got it.
I‘ll deal with it. Yeah. Just a second.

381
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.423
-How you doing?
-Hey.

382
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.425
My partner's gonna help you out
on that side over there.

383
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.468
License, registration.

384
00:27:58.552 --> 00:27:59.761
Uh, yeah.

385
00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:06.018
I'm pulling you over
because your windshield's smashed.

386
00:28:06.101 --> 00:28:07.186
Yeah.

387
00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:11.023
-All this current?
-Yes, Officer.

388
00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:14.943
[officer 1] Hey, man, what'd you do,
have a food fight in here?

389
00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:18.447
[Max] Yeah, I'II-- Pretty messy.
Just clean it up.

390
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.826
Hey, is this blood up here
on your windshield?

391
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.245
Yeah. Uh...

392
00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:29.166
Yeah, uh, uh, I hit a deer.

393
00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:30.250
You hit a deer?

394
00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.002
Yeah, over on, uh...

395
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:34.671
I was on Slauson.

396
00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:36.215
A South Central deer?

397
00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:39.885
Yeah, they out there. They, uh--

398
00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:42.679
It ran right in front of the car
and I couldn't avoid it.

399
00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:44.264
Why you still carrying a passenger?

400
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.142
l was on my way to the depot and he's--

401
00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:49.394
I could just drop him.
His drop is on my way.

402
00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:52.105
Yeah, but your cab‘s unsafe to drive
and we have to impound it.

403
00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:55.150
So we gotta do a vehicle inventory
before the tow truck gets here.

404
00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:57.152
So pop the trunk and step out the vehicle.

405
00:28:57.236 --> 00:29:00.030
Sir, I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to call another cab.

406
00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:02.741
Is that really necessary, Officer?
I'm just a half a mile from here.

407
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.244
Yes, sir, I'm afraid it is.
Please, step out the vehicle.

408
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:06.328
You, too. Come on.

409
00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:08.205
If you open that trunk, they go inside.

410
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.999
You know what, man?
It‘s been a long night. Ah.

411
00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:16.338
Plus, the barn is right up there.
Just give me a break. It's my first fare.

412
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.548
Get out the cab. Open the trunk. Come on.

413
00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:23.804
Step out. You, too, sir. Please.

414
00:29:25.264 --> 00:29:29.268
<i>This is Rampart Division dispatch.
Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover.</i>

415
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.188
<i>All available Precinct 26 units respond.
Over.</i>

416
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.774
-Hey, partner, we gotta roll.
-Roger. En route.

417
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.193
Go straight to the garage.
Have a nice night, sir.

418
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.009
Stop here.

419
00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:29.661
Hands on the wheel, 10 and 2.

420
00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:31.246
Why?

421
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.414
Because I say so.

422
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.052
-[man on radio] <i>Max. Max.</i>
-Shit.

423
00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:47.137
<i>You out there, you son of a bitch ?</i>

424
00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:50.640
Who is that?

425
00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.851
That's Lenny. Just dispatch.

426
00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:57.564
[Lenny] <i>Max, I know you’re out there.
Answer the goddamn call.</i>

427
00:30:57.647 --> 00:30:58.940
What happens if you don't?

428
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:01.902
-[Max] He just keeps calling me.
-[Lenny] <i>Max, answer.</i>

429
00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.575
[sighs] Don't blow it.

430
00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:13.538
Yeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.

431
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.040
[Lenny] <i>Just got off the phone
with the cops.</i>

432
00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:17.584
<i>Desk sergeant called to check
you brought the cab in.</i>

433
00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:19.669
Yeah, so?

434
00:31:19.753 --> 00:31:21.797
[Lenny] <i>So aside from
I hate talking to cops,</i>

435
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.132
<i>they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?</i>

436
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:27.636
No. No, I got crashed into. I didn't...

437
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.430
[Lenny] <i>Do I care what, where or why?
You’re paying.</i>

438
00:31:30.514 --> 00:31:31.681
[Max sighs]

439
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:39.106
It was an accident. You‘re not liable.

440
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.651
It was an accident. I'm not liable.

441
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:45.612
[Lenny] <i>Bullshit l’m making you liable.
it’s coming out of your goddamn pocket.</i>

442
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:47.447
You tell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

443
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:49.699
-I can't do that. That's my boss.
-So?

444
00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:52.119
-I need my job.
-No, you don't.

445
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:56.164
[Lenny] <i>You still there?
I’m talking to you. Max! Max!</i>

446
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:59.459
-He's not paying you a damn thing.
-[Lenny] <i>Who the hell is this?</i>

447
00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:06.341
Albert Riccardo, Assistant US Attorney,

448
00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:09.136
a passenger in this cab,
and I'm reporting you to the DMV.

449
00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:10.929
[Lenny] <i>Let’s not-- Let’s not get excited</i>

450
00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.889
Not get excited?
How am I supposed to not get excited,

451
00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:14.975
listening to you
try to extort a working man?

452
00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:17.018
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

453
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:19.396
and general-liability umbrella
will cover the damages.

454
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:22.023
What are you trying to pull,
you sarcastic prick?

455
00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:24.067
-[Lenny] <i>Look, I was just flying to--</i>
-Tell it to him.

456
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:26.528
Tell him he‘s an asshole. Go ahead.

457
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:28.321
You're an asshole.

458
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.824
Tell him he pulls this shit again,

459
00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:33.160
you're gonna stick this yellow cab
up his fat ass.

460
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.832
And next time you pull any shit, I‘m--

461
00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:42.294
I'm gonna have to stick this yellow cab
up your fat ass.

462
00:32:55.182 --> 00:32:56.433
[grunts]

463
00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:59.644

[woman on TV]
<i>Things like protective orders,</i>

466
00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:03.690

[man on TV] <i>Well, a protective order is
a tool that we use,</i>

470
00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:13.492

Thank you. Thank you.

Hey, man. Look, I gotta get out of here.

Look, I'm tied up in here.
This guy tied me up.

-You all tied up in there, huh?

Yeah, I'm trapped. Get me outta here

are tied to the steering wheel?

00:35:18.325 --> 00:35:19.618
That my briefcase?

504
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:22.787
This your briefcase? Yeah, it is.
Why, you want it back?

505
00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:24.331
How about your wallet?

506
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.918
What else you got for me, huh?

507
00:35:33.757 --> 00:35:34.799
Fuck!

508
00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:53.526
Where's the button? Under the dash?

509
00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:01.534
Mind getting it?

510
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:11.294
[sighs]

511
00:36:14.214 --> 00:36:17.592
You attract attention, you're gonna get
people killed who didn't need to be.

512
00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:18.885
You understand?

513
00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:21.012
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

514
00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:33.525
But, hey, new news.
We're ahead of schedule.

515
00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:35.443
You like jazz?

516
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:37.862
I'm sorry. Wh-What?

517
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.572
Jazz. You like jazz?

518
00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:41.282
Not that much.

519
00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.662
Guy told me about this place off Crenshaw.

520
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:48.331
Leimert Park.
All the West Coast greats played there.

521
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:53.044
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,
Chet Baker. Like that.

522
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.798
Come on, finish up. Buy you a drink.

523
00:37:03.263 --> 00:37:06.141
-[helicopter whirring overhead]
-[chattering]

524
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.854
This informant of yours,
what's his name? Ramone?

525
00:37:10.937 --> 00:37:14.315
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

526
00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.026
He doesn't show up,
I roll here, find this.

527
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.945
Yeah, how long you been working this guy?

528
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:21.656
Four months. He's a low-level player.

529
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.868
Part of a distribution network
that hooks up to Felix.

530
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:28.163
Felix Reyes-Torrena?
Feds are all over him.

531
00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.497
They don't want us anywhere near it.

532
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:32.000
Since when's LAPD working for the Feeb?

533
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:34.502
If they're into it,
they're just gonna take all our stuff,

534
00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:37.005
build their case, take all the credit.
30 what is the point?

535
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:39.215
The point is, is my guy ﬂew out a window.

536
00:37:39.299 --> 00:37:40.925
So if my CI flies out a window,

537
00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:43.803
then he's got Felix's handprints
on his ass.

538
00:37:43.887 --> 00:37:45.346
That makes it mine.

539
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.058
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

540
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:53.104
-I just see a bunch of broken glass.
-And blood.

541
00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:56.483
[woman]
Down here, in the glass. Here's some more.

542
00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:59.694
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

543
00:38:00.737 --> 00:38:02.906
-[woman on phone] <i>Richard?</i>
-Yeah, it‘s me.

544
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.991
[sighs]

545
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.082
Ramone went through that window, splat.

546
00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:17.212
Glass here. Then tires rolled over it.

547
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:20.215
-Maybe he jumped.
-Sure.

548
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:23.635
He's depressed, so he jumps four stories
out of a window onto his head.

549
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.762
"Wow, that feels better."
Picks himself up.

550
00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:27.388
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day."

551
00:38:27.472 --> 00:38:29.557
[phone beeps]

552
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:32.560
-Come on, man.
-Hey, Ray! Catch.

553
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:38.900
-Recent?
-You can still smell the cordite.

554
00:38:41.027 --> 00:38:43.112
[officer] Old guy across the alley
watching late-night TV

555
00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:45.406
says he saw a cab parked here
earlier tonight

556
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.951
with two guys walking around the hood.

557
00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:49.619
Description? He see anything?

558
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.664
Kind of saw.
Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.

559
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:55.291
There are 4,000 taxicabs in LA County.

560
00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:57.460
-You got anything else?
-That‘s it.

561
00:38:57.544 --> 00:39:00.630
Okay. Keep knocking. Let's keep knocking.

562
00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:03.842
Remember that Bay Area deal? Oakland?

563
00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:06.427
Cabbie drove around all night,
killed three people,

564
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:07.887
then put the gun to his head.

565
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:09.222
Yeah, the guy flipped out. So what?

566
00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.808
So that Oakland PD detective,
what‘s-his-name, he never bought it.

567
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:14.894
Cabbie had no criminal record,
no history of mental illness.

568
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.564
Pops three people, then himself?

569
00:39:19.232 --> 00:39:22.318
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

570
00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:29.450
[mid-tempo jazz fusion playing]

571
00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:56.603
I never learned to listen to jazz.

572
00:39:58.688 --> 00:40:02.025
It‘s off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what‘s expected.

573
00:40:02.775 --> 00:40:04.193
Improvising, like tonight.

574
00:40:05.028 --> 00:40:06.195
Like tonight?

575
00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:11.701
[audience whooping, cheering]

576
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:32.931
Most people, ten years from now,

577
00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:35.266
same job, same place, same routine,
everything the same.

578
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.061
Just keeping it safe
over and over and over.

579
00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:39.437
Ten years from now.

580
00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:43.775
Man, you don't know where you'll be
ten minutes from now.

581
00:40:45.234 --> 00:40:46.527
Do you?

582
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:03.252
Who is that on the trumpet?

583
00:41:03.336 --> 00:41:05.505
[waitress] That's Daniel, baby.
He's the owner.

584
00:41:07.757 --> 00:41:08.883
He's terrific.

585
00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:11.386
Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

586
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.346
I gotta buy him a drink.

587
00:41:13.429 --> 00:41:14.681
Sure thing, darling.

588
00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:26.150
[Daniel] <i>No, now, see, I was about 19,
bussing tables right here.</i>

589
00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:29.070
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

590
00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.990
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

591
00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:33.658
I mean, take this one night.

592
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:36.953
July 22nd, 1964.
Who you think walks through that door?

593
00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:38.746
[woman] Bye, baby.

594
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.249
-Miles Davis. That's right.
-[Max] Mmm.

595
00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.542
-In the flesh?
-That‘s right.

596
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:46.004
I'm talking about through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

597
00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:47.380
[Vincent] Jesus.

598
00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:51.759
Anyway, he had been at a recording session
up at Columbia, up on Vine.

599
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.095
So Miles comes through that door.

600
00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:58.307
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

601
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.561
-It had to be--
-Oh. [chuckles] It was scary.

602
00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:04.313
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

603
00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:06.691
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway, man.

604
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:08.192
Everybody and their mama knew

605
00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:11.320
that you don't just come up
and talk to Miles Davis.

606
00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:15.825
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

607
00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:18.411
This one young, hip couple,

608
00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:20.163
one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

609
00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:23.291
And the guy says, "Hi, my name is--"

610
00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:25.835
Miles said, "Get the fuck out of my face,
you jive motherfucker.

611
00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:27.211
Take your silly bitch with you."

612
00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:29.464
-[laughing]
-[Max] Mmm!

613
00:42:30.006 --> 00:42:32.508
You know? That's-- That was Miles, man.

614
00:42:32.592 --> 00:42:36.846
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

615
00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.806
But did you get to talk to him?

616
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.058
-Better than that.
-No.

617
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.852
I played for about 20 minutes.

618
00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:44.353
[Vincent] Unbelievable.

619
00:42:44.437 --> 00:42:46.147
-How'd you do?
-How'd I do?

620
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.233
Well, you really ain't shit
when you're playing next to Miles Davis.

621
00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:51.527
But he carried my ass. [chuckles]

622
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:55.281
-What'd he say?
-He said one word. "Cool."

623
00:42:55.364 --> 00:42:56.908
-"Cool"?
-Yeah.

624
00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:58.493
-That's it?
-Yeah.

625
00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.870
That meant, "Good, but not ready."

626
00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:03.498
It meant, “Look me up when you are.“

627
00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:04.999
Did you?

628
00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:10.088
No. I got drafted
and got into some other things,

629
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:14.634
and, uh, by the time I got back to music,
the season had passed.

630
00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:18.721
But, you know, I was born in 1945,

631
00:43:18.805 --> 00:43:22.517
but that night was
the moment of my conception.

632
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.477
Right here in this room.

633
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.728
Crowd‘s not here now.

634
00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:28.523
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

635
00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:31.692
What a great story.

636
00:43:31.776 --> 00:43:33.736
-[Daniel] Mmm.
-[door opens]

637
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.573
I gotta tell the people in Culiacán
and Cartagena that story.

638
00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:43.454
[door closes, lock clicks]

639
00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:54.006
You know the folks in Culiacán
and Cartagena?

640
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.675
Afraid so.

641
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.554
Man, just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

642
00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:03.266
I am a cool guy,
with a job I contracted to do.

643
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:05.643
Come on, Vincent, give the dude a pass.

644
00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:06.811
-I‘m working here.
-[Max] Now, listen.

645
00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:08.938
You the one talking about improvisation.

646
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:12.400
You like the guy, you like how he plays.
Let's just play a little jazz. Come on.

647
00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:15.319
lmprovi-- That's funny, coming from you.

648
00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:17.822
[sighs]

649
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.245
How's this? I‘ll ask a question.

650
00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.830
[Daniel] What question?

651
00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:27.123
A jazz question.

652
00:44:27.957 --> 00:44:30.459
Now, you get it right, we roll.

653
00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:34.005
You disappear tonight.

654
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.340
If I walk out of here tonight,

655
00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:39.635
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

656
00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.888
And one more thing.

657
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:44.891
These people and their rep here, Felix,

658
00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:48.227
well, you tell them I'm sorry.

659
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:52.982
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

660
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:56.152
I was compelled.
It was either play ball or go back inside.

661
00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:59.363
And I'm not going back inside.

662
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.826
Yeah.

663
00:45:07.163 --> 00:45:08.998
Lay it on me.

664
00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:11.459
Where did Miles learn music?

665
00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.419
I know everything
there is to know about Miles.

666
00:45:13.502 --> 00:45:14.503
[Vincent] Then let's have it.

667
00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:18.341
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

668
00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:21.260
His father was a dentist, East St. Louis.

669
00:45:21.344 --> 00:45:23.262
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

670
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:26.724
He sent Miles
to Juilliard School of Music,

671
00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:29.060
New York, 1945.

672
00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:30.436
Man.

673
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:32.313
[silenced gunshots]

674
00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:46.744
Dropped out of Juilliard
after less than a year.

675
00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:49.247
Tracked down Charlie Parker
on 52nd Street,

676
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.582
who mentored him for the next three years.

677
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.343
[chair scrapes on floor]

678
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:07.098
[door opens]

679
00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:10.559
[door closes]

680
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:16.274
-Hey.

681
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.278
-No, I'm done. Find you another cab.
-Max.

682
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:23.030
Leave me alone. I'm collateral anyway.

683
00:46:23.114 --> 00:46:24.407
[grunts]

684
00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:31.414
I am not playing.

685
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.543
You played him, man.

686
00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:41.173
If he got the answer right,
would you have let him go?

687
00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:47.972
[Lenny] <i>This is 102. This is 102. Max?</i>

688
00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:49.849
What is it with this guy?

689
00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:51.100
[Lenny] <i>Max?</i>

690
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:03.612
-You hassling my driver again?
-[Lenny] <i>Who are you?</i>

691
00:47:03.696 --> 00:47:05.489
The same guy you talked to last time.

692
00:47:06.324 --> 00:47:09.744
[Lenny] <i>Max’s mother’s driving me crazy.
Put him on the line, please.</i>

693
00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:10.828
Hang on.

694
00:47:12.455 --> 00:47:13.664
Carefully.

695
00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:17.293
Yeah.

696
00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:18.919
[Lenny] <i>Your mother’s
calling every ten minutes.</i>

697
00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:21.130
<i>”Why didn’t he show?”
“Are you all right?” “Where are you?”</i>

698
00:47:21.213 --> 00:47:22.381
Show for what?

699
00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:26.010
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

700
00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:28.471
[Lenny] <i>I’m not related to you.
You tell her yourself</i>

701
00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:29.722
Show up for what?

702
00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:33.392
[sighs] She's in the hospital.

703
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:35.186
You visit every night?

704
00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:36.937
Yeah. What difference does it make?

705
00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:39.357
-You don't show up, it breaks routine.
-So?

706
00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:43.652
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

707
00:47:45.488 --> 00:47:46.781
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

708
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:50.826
Since when was any of this negotiable?

709
00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:57.083
[chattering]

710
00:47:58.584 --> 00:48:00.461
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

711
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:08.511
Hey. Flowers?

712
00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:11.931
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

713
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.477
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

714
00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:23.526
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

715
00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:26.445
Excuse me. Keep the change.

716
00:48:30.366 --> 00:48:31.951
[elevator bell dings]

717
00:48:38.124 --> 00:48:39.625
[Fanning] Hold that elevator, please.

718
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.588
-Floor?
-Five. Thanks.

719
00:48:56.517 --> 00:48:59.895
-Having a good night?
<i>-Mezzo mezzo.</i> You?

720
00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.444
[beeping]

721
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:08.612
[bell dings]

722
00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.614
Excuse me.

723
00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:28.048
[bell dings]

724
00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:45.941
Hey, Ma.

725
00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:50.279
I've been calling and calling.

726
00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:51.614
Yeah, well, I got caught up at work.

727
00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:53.866
Why couldn't you call me on the telephone?

728
00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:56.785
I'm lying here wondering
if something terrible happened to you.

729
00:49:56.869 --> 00:49:58.162
I brought you flowers.

730
00:49:58.245 --> 00:49:59.538
What am I gonna do with flowers?

731
00:49:59.622 --> 00:50:01.999
-[Max] Cheer up.
-How? Huh?

732
00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:06.003
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that‘s just gonna wilt and die?

733
00:50:06.962 --> 00:50:07.963
See what I mean?

734
00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:10.925
I didn‘t buy you the flowers, Mom. He did.

735
00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.051
Who?

736
00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:19.266
[whispering]
Why didn't you tell me we had company?

737
00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:25.481
What's your name? Sorry. My son is rude.

738
00:50:25.564 --> 00:50:26.941
No harm done, ma'am.

739
00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:32.321
You paid for my flowers?
They're beautiful.

740
00:50:40.204 --> 00:50:41.205
Well, Max?

741
00:50:45.834 --> 00:50:49.588
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

742
00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:55.052
I'm very happy to meet you, Mrs. Durocher.

743
00:50:55.135 --> 00:50:56.887
Oh, just call me Ida. [chuckles]

744
00:50:56.971 --> 00:51:00.182
Ida. I was with Max when he got the call.

745
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.227
[Ida] And you came all the way
over here to see me?

746
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:04.728
[Vincent] It's nothing, ma‘am.

747
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:06.522
[scoffs] Tell my son.

748
00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:09.858
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

749
00:51:10.693 --> 00:51:14.154
You must be
one of Max's important clients.

750
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:17.616
Client? I, uh-- You know, I like
to think of myself as his friend.

751
00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:20.244
Max never had many friends.

752
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:23.372
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It‘s unhealthy.

753
00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:26.041
Mom, how many times I got to ask you?
Please don't do that.

754
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:27.209
Do what?

755
00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:30.379
Don't-- Don't talk about me like
I‘m not right here in the room here.

756
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:31.755
What's he saying?

757
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:35.426
He says he's standing right here,
in the room here.

758
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:37.845
[Ida chuckling] Yes, you are.

759
00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.597
-He's sensitive.
-I know.

760
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:42.266
But I'm sure you‘re very proud of him.

761
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:46.228
Of course I'm proud.
He started with nothing, you know.

762
00:51:46.312 --> 00:51:48.897
Look at him today. Here, Vegas--

763
00:51:48.981 --> 00:51:52.651
Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom, he is not interested
in hearing about all that, okay?

764
00:51:52.735 --> 00:51:55.154
I came to see you. I saw you.
You look good. Let's go.

765
00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:58.657
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

766
00:51:58.741 --> 00:52:00.618
Limousine companies.

767
00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:01.702
[Vincent] Is that right?

768
00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:04.038
[Ida] He drives famous people around.

769
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:08.459
Famous people. Limousine companies.
Now, that's quite an achievement.

770
00:52:08.542 --> 00:52:10.544
[Ida] What did you say
your name was again?

771
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:12.588
-My name is Vincent, ma'am.
-Ah.

772
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.590
Visit again?

773
00:52:14.673 --> 00:52:16.884
[Vincent] No, I‘m just in town tonight.

774
00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.844
-[Ida] Oh. When you come back.
-[Vincent] Sure.

775
00:52:37.446 --> 00:52:38.614
Max!

776
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:23.534
[Vincent] Don't!

777
00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:54.606
-[grunts]
-All of my prep was in there.

778
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:57.025
You are screwing with my work.

779
00:54:02.322 --> 00:54:04.074
Let's see what else you can do.

780
00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:06.201
[Max groans]

781
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:11.707
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

782
00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:19.256
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

783
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:26.513
No, next.

784
00:54:26.597 --> 00:54:29.683
Okay, you know, something's funny
about this, though, you know.

785
00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:34.104
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

786
00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:38.650
The kid and that last guy,
both done by the same shooter, I think.

787
00:54:39.735 --> 00:54:40.986
Why do you say that?

788
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:42.404
Uh, wound pattern.

789
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:46.241
Uh, two in the sternum, one in the head.

790
00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:49.953
This guy, he's shooting tight groups too.
All right? Check this out.

791
00:54:50.037 --> 00:54:52.247
Double taps a couple millimeters apart.

792
00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:54.458
Let‘s see this one.

793
00:55:04.343 --> 00:55:05.469
See what I mean?

794
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:10.432
Holy shit. Can I use your phone?

795
00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:11.517
Yeah.

796
00:55:15.604 --> 00:55:17.439
[phone: line ringing]

797
00:55:17.523 --> 00:55:19.233
Come on, come on, wake up.

798
00:55:24.279 --> 00:55:26.281
[phone ringing]

799
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.374
-[phone beeps]
-Hello.

800
00:55:35.457 --> 00:55:39.086
Hey, it's Fanning. I'm still down here
at the morgue at Sisters of Charity.

801
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.462
Those John Does didn't pan out,

802
00:55:40.546 --> 00:55:43.215
but you're never gonna guess
who I got here in the meat locker.

803
00:55:43.298 --> 00:55:45.509
-Who?
-Sylvester Clarke.

804
00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:47.594
Criminal attorney turned lawyer-criminal.

805
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:53.141
<i>Including Ramone, who he represented,
who’s still missing.</i>

806
00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:56.019
The both of whom are in
the exotic-substances business together.

807
00:55:56.103 --> 00:56:00.232
There's something going on,
and I don't think the feds know about it.

808
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:03.443
Tell you what. Stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone.

809
00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.153
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.

810
00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:06.864
Good.

811
00:56:13.495 --> 00:56:15.372
[Vincent] You're gonna go to a place
called El Rodeo.

812
00:56:15.455 --> 00:56:17.249
It‘s on Washington Boulevard
in Pico Rivera.

813
00:56:17.332 --> 00:56:19.918
-Where at on Washington?
-Look it up.

814
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.090
[beeping]

815
00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:26.466
Limos, huh?

816
00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:28.594
Don‘t start.

817
00:56:29.136 --> 00:56:30.596
Hey, I‘m not the one lying to my mother.

818
00:56:31.597 --> 00:56:34.391
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

819
00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:36.602
Yeah, right.
Maybe she hears what you tell her.

820
00:56:36.685 --> 00:56:38.645
Whatever I tell her
is never good enough anyway.

821
00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:40.188
It's always been that way.

822
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.775
[sighs] So what's at El Rodeo?

823
00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:45.068
[Vincent] Just drive.

824
00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:49.281
They project onto you their flaws.

825
00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:52.034
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

826
00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:55.162
They rank on you instead.

827
00:56:56.538 --> 00:56:57.664
How do you know?

828
00:56:58.498 --> 00:56:59.583
I had a father like that.

829
00:57:01.126 --> 00:57:02.210
Mothers are worse.

830
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:04.504
Wouldn't know.
My mother died before I remember.

831
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:06.548
What happened to your father?

832
00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:09.217
Hated everything I did.

833
00:57:10.928 --> 00:57:15.223
Got drunk, beat me up. Foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

834
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.770
Then what?

835
00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:23.649
I killed him.

836
00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:27.903
I was 12.

837
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.242
[laughs]

838
00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:36.787
I'm kidding.

839
00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:41.667
He died of liver disease.

840
00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:46.171
Well, I'm sorry.

841
00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:47.381
No, you're not.

842
00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:06.692
What is this, driving a cab temporarily?
It's just all bullshit, huh?

843
00:58:06.775 --> 00:58:08.527
It is not bullshit.

844
00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:10.821
[Vincent] Twelve years
isn't temporary, Max.

845
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:15.033
[sighs] Gotta get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

846
00:58:15.117 --> 00:58:16.743
Gotta staff up, get the right client list.

847
00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:19.913
It‘s not just simply get the car
and put asses in the seats.

848
00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:21.081
Why not?

849
00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:24.710
Because Island Limos
is more than just a ride.

850
00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:28.255
It's, uh, like a club experience.
Cool groove.

851
00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:32.175
Don‘t want it to end.
It‘s gotta be perfect.

852
00:58:33.093 --> 00:58:35.303
-[Vincent] Uh-huh.
-Perfect.

853
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:38.348
It's up here. Turn right.

854
00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.198
[chattering]

855
00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:00.829
Give me your wallet. Come on.

856
00:59:00.912 --> 00:59:03.206
Give you my wallet. For what?

857
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:06.585
I'II hold it for you
in case the people inside search you.

858
00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:08.462
Who's searching?

859
00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:12.340
The people inside.
Go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.

860
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:14.009
-Felix.
-Yeah.

861
00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:16.595
-What does he look like?
-I don't know. I've never met him.

862
00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:17.721
Who is he?

863
00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:20.390
He's connected to the guys who hired me.

864
00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:21.475
I don't get it.

865
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.894
You destroyed my workups.
Number four's due.

866
00:59:23.977 --> 00:59:25.979
What'd you think, night's over?
Called on account of rain?

867
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.357
You go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

868
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:31.651
They'll be on flash drive or CD.

869
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:33.528
-Me? How come you don't go?
-'Cause I don't meet people.

870
00:59:33.612 --> 00:59:35.197
Risk management. Anonymity.
I protect mine.

871
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.698
You're not gonna screw that up.

872
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:39.826
I got a contract with their bosses.
These guys don't get to meet me.

873
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.244
They don't know what I look like.

874
00:59:42.454 --> 00:59:43.622
But-- [scoffs]

875
00:59:43.705 --> 00:59:46.625
But if-- if I don't pull it off, then--

876
00:59:46.708 --> 00:59:49.211
They will kill you.
Now, you got 10 minutes.

877
00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:50.962
At 10:01, I drive to the hospital

878
00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:52.839
and execute your mother
on my way out of town.

879
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:54.007
And don't pretend indifference.

880
00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:55.217
I can't do this.

881
00:59:56.051 --> 00:59:57.135
I can't.

882
00:59:57.219 --> 00:59:59.763
What are you talking about?
Sure you can, man. Come on. Hey. Hey.

883
00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:03.350
Look, man, if I do this, I'm just gonna
end up getting other people killed.

884
01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.728
Out of options, Max. Just take comfort
in knowing you never had a choice.

885
01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.566
-How long you been doing this?
-Why?

886
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.235
Just in case they ask me.

887
01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.862
Private sector, six years.

888
01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.447
Okay. All right, six years.

889
01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:22.577
You get benefits?
Or, you know, like, insurance? Pension?

890
01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:25.997
No. No paid sick leave. Quit stalling.
Get out of the cab.

891
01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.084
[sighs]

892
01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:32.838
[exhales]

893
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:39.427
[chattering]

894
01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.611
-Yeah? Hold up.
-Hold on, man.

895
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.493
[radio chatter]

896
01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:05.996
Who is this?

897
01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.294
Mark the time.

898
01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:18.800
All right, it's cool.

899
01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:26.057
<i>¿Qué pasa?</i> What's up, homes?

900
01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.642
Hey. What's up? Uh...

901
01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:30.854
I'm here to see Felix.
Uh, he has something for me.

902
01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.814
Don't know no Felix.

903
01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.566
Okay.

904
01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:38.570
[sighs] Uh, tell him...

905
01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.075
Vincent. Uh, say it‘s Vincent.

906
01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.119
l'm-- I'm Vincent.

907
01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.836
[speaking Spanish]

908
01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.051
-[radio chatter]
-Copy.

909
01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.764
Let him in. Let him in right now.
Go ahead.

910
01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.747
[gate opens]

911
01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:39.923
Detective Richard Weidner, LAPD,
Major Narcotics Division.

912
01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:42.717
-Detective Ray Fanning, LAPD--
-Yeah. Hi. Okay. How are you?

913
01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.344
Agent Frank Pedrosa.

914
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.264
-Good. Thanks for seeing us, Frank.
-Yeah, you're welcome. How can I help?

915
01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:48.974
What's up?
Why do you wanna know about our case?

916
01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:51.893
-Any unusual activity tonight?
-Like what?

917
01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:54.229
That relates to a murder
or a series of murders

918
01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.189
in Wilshire Central or West Hollywood?

919
01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:59.567
All quiet on the western front.

920
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:02.362
Various people are asleep.
Various people are not.

921
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.032
They come and go in cars, pickups, taxis.

922
01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.326
Other than that, we watch air move.

923
01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.204
-[Fanning scoffs]
-Your interest in our case?

924
01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.999
Well, our interest--
We got a situation. Two bodies.

925
01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.751
Could be a coincidence,
could not be a coincidence.

926
01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:20.755
It doesn't look like one.
We got an attorney and his client--

927
01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.007
Roof‘s all beat to shit.

928
01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:24.926
Roof‘s all beat to shit.

929
01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.556
-Can you zoom in on this, please?
-On what?

930
01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.516
-On that.
-[beeping]

931
01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.356
-[Fanning] Look at that right there.
-[Weidner] What is it?

932
01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:46.823
Yeah. 5-Queen-49974.

933
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.367
5Q49974.

934
01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:52.620
-[band playing ranchera music]
-[chattering]

935
01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:47.217
I thought you‘d be taller.

936
01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:52.097
So, Vincent.

937
01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.937
-What are the two names?
-[Fanning] Ramone Ayala and Clarke.

938
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.523
Are you telling me Ramone Ayala
and Clarke were murdered tonight?

939
01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.733
-Both killed?
-Sylvester Clarke for sure.

940
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.860
-Ramone, I don't know.
-I got another DOA.

941
01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:08.530
Daniel Baker out of South Central,
Leimert Park.

942
01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:09.823
That's three.

943
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.282
-Three what?
-Witnesses.

944
01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:18.998
Vincent meet their people
in Culiacán or Cartagena.

945
01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.168
But he don't meet you. Okay.

946
01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:25.797
Now you‘re here.

947
01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.509
Why?

948
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.389
I lost my stuff.

949
01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.225
The list.

950
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:43.022
I want you to listen to me real well.

951
01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.485
Special groups put together
the list of <i>dedos.</i>

952
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:50.780
<i>-Dedos?</i>
-Fingers. Informants. Huh?

953
01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:56.369
Signal interceptions with
voice-recognition software, surveillance.

954
01:05:56.453 --> 01:06:00.748
Uh, a very expensive counterintelligence
worked up that list.

955
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:04.127
An important list. Wouldn't you say?

956
01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:07.255
And you lost it?

957
01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.469
Yeah. I'm sorry.

958
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.847
Sorry.

959
01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:22.103
"Sorry"? "Sorry" does not put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

960
01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:27.817
-Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
-No.

961
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.944
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

962
01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.696
-Nor do I.

963
01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.658
Nor do I, but my children do.
They are still small.

964
01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:39.954
But do you know who they like even
better than Santa Claus? His helper.

965
01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:45.001
Pedro eI Negro. Black Peter. Yeah.

966
01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.171
There's an old Mexican tale...
[clears throat]

967
01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.173
...that tells of how Santa Claus

968
01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.759
got so very busy
looking out for the good children

969
01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:56.513
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.

970
01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.556
So he hired Pedro.

971
01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.600
And Santa Claus gave him a list

972
01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:04.145
with all the names
of all the bad children. Hmm?

973
01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:07.065
And Pedro would come every night
to check them out.

974
01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:10.401
And the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,

975
01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.737
that were not saying their prayers,

976
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:17.450
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows. Hmm?

977
01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.285
A little burro.

978
01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.246
And he would come back.

979
01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.248
And if the children
were still misbehaving,

980
01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.626
Pedro would take them away
and nobody would ever see them again.

981
01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:32.090
Now, if I am being Santa Claus,
and you are Pedro,

982
01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:35.969
how do you think
jolly old Santa Claus would feel

983
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:39.514
if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, "I lost the list"?

984
01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.933
How fucking furious
do you think he would get?

985
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.686
Tell me, Vincent.

986
01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.105
Tell me what you think.

987
01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.109
-[clears throat]
-What?

988
01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.863
[scoffs] l-- I think...

989
01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:03.413
I think you should
tell the guy behind me...

990
01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:06.165
to put that gun down.

991
01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.918
What did you say?

992
01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:12.714
I said, I think you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away

993
01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.383
before I take it
and beat his bitch ass to death with it.

994
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.104
I picked up a tail.

995
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.316
-Federal?
-I don't know. You tell me.

996
01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:34.694
That's why I tossed the list.

997
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.780
The workups, all of that shit.

998
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:42.076
To protect, in part, your...

999
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:46.164
Hermès, Façonnable ass.

1000
01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:52.920
What, you think I like coming in here?

1001
01:08:54.422 --> 01:08:55.590
[scoffs]

1002
01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:58.843
But, hey, shit happens.

1003
01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:04.557
Gotta roll with it. Adapt.
Darwin. <i>I Ching.</i>

1004
01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:07.894
Has, uh--

1005
01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.730
The fat man. The penthouse guy.
The jazz man.

1006
01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:13.691
That leaves two.

1007
01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:24.661
Can you finish?

1008
01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.664
In six years...

1009
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:31.834
when have I not?

1010
01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:34.170
[distorted] <i>Say it’s Vincent.</i>

1011

You're a monument of it.
You even bullshitted yourself.

1178
01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.434
"All I am is taking out the garbage,
killing bad people."

1179
01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:11.727
Well, that's what you said.

1180
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.103
You believed me?

1181
01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:15.814
[scoffs] Then what'd they do?

1182
01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.984
How do I know? You know?
They all got that...

1183
01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:22.571
"witness for the prosecution" look to me.

1184
01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:25.031
Probably some major federal indictment

1185
01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.659
of somebody
who majorly does not wanna get indicted.

1186
01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:29.995
So that's the reason?

1187
01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.039
That's the why. There's no reason.

1188
01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.917
There‘s no good reason,
there's no bad reason to live or to die.

1189
01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:38.587
Then what are you?

1190
01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:40.464
Indifferent.

1191
01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:44.885
Get with it.

1192
01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:47.220
Millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars

1193
01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:49.431
and a speck on one in a blink.

1194
01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:51.850
That's us. Lost in space.

1195
01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:56.354
The cop, you, me-- who notices?

1196
01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.407
What's with you?

1197
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:09.951
As in?

1198
01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.455
As in, if somebody had a gun
to your head and said,

1199
01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:16.124
"You gotta tell me what's going on
with this person over here

1200
01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.626
or I'm gonna kill you.

1201
01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:23.089
What is driving him?
What was he thinking?"

1202
01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:25.008
You couldn't do it, could you? Because...

1203
01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:27.511
They would have to kill your ass,

1204
01:28:27.594 --> 01:28:31.515
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.

1205
01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:35.477
I think you're low, my brother. Way low.

1206
01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:40.649
Like, what were you? One of those
institutionalized-raised guys?

1207
01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:42.567
Anybody home?

1208
01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.904
And-- And the standard parts

1209
01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:48.198
that are supposed to be there
in people, in you...

1210
01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:50.534
aren't.

1211
01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:56.873
And why haven't you killed me yet?

1212
01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:04.673
Of all the cabbies in LA, I get Max--
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.

1213
01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:08.260
Answer the question.

1214
01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:11.346
Look in the mirror.

1215
01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:16.101
Paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.

1216
01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.561
How much you got saved?

1217
01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:19.396
That ain‘t none of your business.

1218
01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:22.649
Someday? "Someday my dream will come"?

1219
01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:26.111
One night you'll wake up,
and you'll discover it never happened.

1220
01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.113
It's all turned around on you.

1221
01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.990
It never will. Suddenly you are old.

1222
01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.451
Didn't happen.

1223
01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.745
And it never will, because you
were never gonna do it anyway.

1224
01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:39.791
You'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your BarcaLounger,

1225
01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:43.503
being hypnotized by daytime TV
for the rest of your life.

1226
01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.256
Don't you talk to me about murder.

1227
01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:50.510
All it ever took was a down payment
on a Lincoln Town Car.

1228
01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:52.387
Or that girl.
You can‘t even call that girl.

1229
01:29:54.598 --> 01:29:56.766
What the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?

1230
01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:19.039
Because I never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?

1231
01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:20.832
Myself. I should have.

1232
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:25.545
I've tried to gamble my way
out from under,

1233
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.714
but that was just a born-to-lose deal.

1234
01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:30.884
-Slow down.
-It’s gotta be perfect.

1235
01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:34.596
It's got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.

1236
01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:38.058
I could've done it anytime I wanted to.

1237
01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:40.685
Red light.

1238
01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:42.479
[engine revs]

1239
01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:49.527
But you know what? New news.

1240
01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.448
It doesn‘t matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?

1241
01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:57.243
We're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.

1242
01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:58.662
<i>Twilight Zone</i> shit.

1243

Says the badass sociopath in my back seat.

1245
01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:15.178
But you know what? That's the one thing
I gotta thank you for, bro.

1246
01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:17.389
Because until now,
I never looked at it that way.

1247
01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:23.436
What does it matter?
It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.

1248
01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:26.606
What do we got to lose anyway, right?

1249
01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:29.109
Slow down.

1250
01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.820
Why? You gonna shoot me?
You gonna pull the trigger and kill us?

1251
01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:32.904
Go ahead, shoot my ass.

1252
01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:34.489
-Slow the hell down.
-You gonna shoot me?

1253
01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:39.452
You gonna shoot me now? You gonna kill us?
Huh? Well, shoot my ass, then. Shoot me.

1254
01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:42.622
-Slow down!
-You're right. [breathing heavily]

1255
01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:43.748
You know what, Vincent?

1256
01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:46.543
Go fuck yourself.

1257
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:04.602
[coughing]

1258
01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:21.244
Well, that was brilliant.

1259
01:32:21.327 --> 01:32:23.038
Didn't have your seat belt on?

An ambulance is on its way to help you.

You understand what I'm saying to you?

-I‘m just--
-Sit down and relax, okay?

1269
01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:25.517
Okay. Don't worry about the cab.
They'll get you a new one.

Put your hands up. Face the cab.
Get down on your knees.

-Yeah. Go ahead and arrest me.
-Put your hands on top of your head.

-Take me to jail. LA County jail’s great.
-Don't move!

Put your hands behind your head.
