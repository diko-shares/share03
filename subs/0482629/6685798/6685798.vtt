1
00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.444
Are we on?

2
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.725
Hello.

3
00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.587
When? Thank you.

4
00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.497
Yes. I'll tell him.

5
00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.195
Sir.

6
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.399
He's gone.

7
00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.079
Contact family members...

8
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.576
the various corporate boards...

9
00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.414
and business interests.

10
00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.154
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.851
Sir, I-

12
00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.327
I am so sorry for your loss.

13
00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:17.269
Am I speakin' to a
Theophilus Hamilton of Birmingham?

14
00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.537
Sir? Yes, sir. This is he.

15
00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.342
Name's Howard Stevens.
You can call me Red.

16
00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.350
I need a lawyer for a few
business ideas I have...

17
00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.911
a few still in the dream stage.

18
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.760
Though the skies may weep...

19
00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.399
the Bible assures us that
precious in the sight of the Lord...

20
00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.670
is the death of his saints.

21
00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.010
I wonder who the old man
negotiated with for the rain.

22
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.648
Well, it's a sure bet he's laughin'...

23
00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.907
watchin' us get soaked.

24
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.347
Yeah, well, now it's his turn.

25
00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.084
There's not a person here
whose life, in some way...

26
00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:08.591
has not been touched
by Howard "Red" Stevens.

27
00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.162
Red often quoted
Malcolm Muggeridge...

28
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.463
saying that,
"Every happening, great or small...

29
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.564
"is a parable by which
God speaks to us...

30
00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.304
and the art of life
is to get the message."

31
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.613
May the message of Red Stevens continue
in the hearts of those he leaves behind.

32
00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:34.077
What are you doing? You're
gonna get all wet.

33
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.301
Bill.

34
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:42.755
Even though Dad moved his corporate
offices from Texas many years ago...

35
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.022
for tax reasons...

36
00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.598
he always said he wanted
to be buried under Texas soil.

37
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.416
Is that him?

38
00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.130
That's him.

39
00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.109
Mum.

40
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.839
You're late.

41
00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:39.163
For what?

42
00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.185
Give me some of that!

43
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.351
Settle down over there.

44
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.069
Good morning.

45
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.771
Before we start,
I'd like to say how much Red...

46
00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.036
meant to me personally.

47
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.741
As you know, we started out
as business partners...

48
00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.956
and we ended up as friends.

49
00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.054
I am deeply grieved by his passing.

50
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.825
Yes, well, that's very nice.

51
00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.189
Now, may we proceed?

52
00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.134
Red's will

53
00:04:37.158 --> 00:04:39.158
is in his own words...

54
00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:43.376
still, every bit as legal and binding-

55
00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.479
Blah, blah, blah.

56
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.814
"And, so, my eldest son, Bill...

57
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.889
I leave my company,
Panhandle Oil and Gas."

58
00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.157
Currently worth $600 million.

59
00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:04.601
"However, Bill, since you had zero
interest in my company while I was alive

60
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.500
"I don't imagine that will
change much after my death.

61
00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:11.367
Therefore, the board
will maintain control."

62
00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:12.940
Excuse me,

63
00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:15.864
but my client would like
to explore all of his options.

64
00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:18.577
Your client has no more options.

65
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.676
One of those instructions
Mr. Hamilton skipped over...

66
00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:24.780
is Red's desire that each of you vacate
after receiving your portion of the estate.

67
00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.918
- As in, leave the room.
- What the- she can't talk to me like that.

68
00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:32.027
- Well, do something.
- You can go now,

69
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:33.298
Mr. Stevens.

70
00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.234
- What-All right. Fine. Fine.
- We should really go.

71
00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.634
I have never been so humiliated.

72
00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.037
Did you see that old man
talkin' to me that way?

73
00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:44.006
And you guys just sat there
and said absolutely nothin'.

74
00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.674
That's it?

75
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.652
A cow farm?

76
00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:55.476
A 10,000-acre cow farm.

77
00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.224
Well, what's that worth anyway?

78
00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.430
Ruth, come on.
Come here.

79
00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.734
What exactly do we get?

80
00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:12.332
A place for you
to take your mistress.

81
00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.933
Come on, Ruth.
Let me explain.

82
00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:17.737
I want to see everything!
Full disclosure.

83
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.176
- Good day, Mr. Stevens.
- You said you had a strategy!

84
00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:23.108
- This is a long way from over.
- You said it was a slam dunk!

85
00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:27.478
"To Sarah, widow of my late son,
Jay Howard Stevens...

86
00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:30.822
"I am truly sorry
for the events of the past.

87
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.252
"Please know that Jay's death
represents the greatest tragedy...

88
00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.455
"I have ever experienced.

89
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.594
"I leave you control of my Myers Park
estate where you now reside...

90
00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:45.367
"and a managed trust for
expenses as long as you live.

91
00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:46.938
There we go.

92
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.873
"Since your choice of male
companionship is vast and varied...

93
00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:56.437
the deed and title for the house will
remain under the control of my trustees."

94
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.045
- Good day, Mr. Hamilton.
- Good day.

95
00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:08.053
It's amazing just how far
the fruit can fall from the tree.

96
00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.854
And still roll a great distance.

97
00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:13.925
Nice of you to show up.

98
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.425
You're in time for nothin'.

99
00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:18.136
Let's go.

100
00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:25.740
Jason.

101
00:07:27.057 --> 00:07:29.258
How do you know my name?

102
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.718
It's my business to know everyone
named in your grandfather's will.

103
00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:35.777
Let's cut the B.S., 'cause
I know what he left me- nothing.

104
00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.723
Walk away-you'll never know,
will you?

105
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.230
Jason?

106
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.040
So, what's in the box?

107
00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:06.878
Your inheritance.

108
00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:09.845
Have a seat.

109
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:16.853
Does the box or the seal appear to
have been tampered with in any way?

110
00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:19.020
No.

111
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.668
Then therefore
witness this day...

112
00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:28.204
that I am breaking the seal...

113
00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:32.672
affixed in my presence
by Red himself.

114
00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:46.257
Miss Hastings.

115
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:47.681
Yes, sir.

116
00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.490
- Are we on?
- Yes, we are.

117
00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:58.628
Mm. Well, then,
if you're watching this...

118
00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.595
I must be dead.

119
00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:02.764
That's a strange concept.

120
00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.406
How was my funeral?
Well attended?

121
00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:07.545
I hope it rained.

122
00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.004
Hamilton, Miss Hastings...

123
00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:13.150
I hope you're having
a better day than I am.

124
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.444
If you've just been with my family,
I doubt it.

125
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.523
Jason,

126
00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:21.347
I made a lot of mistakes
with our family but

127
00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:24.795
you're the one
I think I hurt the most.

128
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:28.276
The only way I can make it up to you
is to not give you anything.

129
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.964
I knew it.

130
00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:33.928
What I mean by that is that
I'm not giving you anything just yet.

131
00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:36.331
So sit back down there.

132
00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:41.208
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

133
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:46.718
How can I give you something and not
have it ruin you like your uncles and aunts?

134
00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.980
Even some of their kids.

135
00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:50.031
So,

136
00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:53.221
I want to give you a gift-
a series of gifts...

137
00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.786
leading up to, well...

138
00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.653
I wanna call it
"the ultimate gift."

139
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:01.227
Now, you fail in any way,
it's over.

140
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.393
You get nothing.

141
00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:07.331
And everything you do must be
to Mr. Hamilton's satisfaction.

142
00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.972
You might wanna make friends
with him sooner than later.

143
00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:17.342
This is a voice-activated
Conversay.

144
00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:20.476
It allows two-way communication
between our office and you.

145
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:24.246
And you can also replay
Red's messages on it if you need to.

146
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.884
Sir.

147
00:10:26.508 --> 00:10:27.759
Ah, good.

148
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.228
There's a flight to Houston
tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.

149
00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.990
As in morning, 7:00 a.m.?

150
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.525
Yes. That 7:00 a.m.

151
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.237
For what?

152
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.561
You have until then to accept.

153
00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:42.567
- Why do I have to go?
- You'll find out when you get there.

154
00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:44.409
This is whacked.

155
00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:46.933
You might wanna rethink that.

156
00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:53.142
What could he possibly give me
that he hasn't already taken away?

157
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.445
Huh?

158
00:10:54.469 --> 00:10:57.069
Screw him. Screw both of you.

159
00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:02.953
Well.

160
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.000
How was your day?

161
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.865
I'm not sure.

162
00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:14.571
What do you mean?

163
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:17.773
My grandfather may have
left me something.

164
00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.940
- Yeah?
- I'm just trying to figure it out.

165
00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:23.208
You mean it's not cash?

166
00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:25.083
I don't know.

167
00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:26.752
Don't know?

168
00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.720
If I want to play into his little
power trip, I gotta go pick it up.

169
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.015
Where?

170
00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:33.391
Texas.

171
00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:36.823
- Yech.
- You know what? I'm not going.

172
00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.327
Well,

173
00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:40.551
aren't you at least curious?

174
00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.327
What if it's...

175
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:43.751
gold?

176
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.131
He ruined my life.

177
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.839
My best revenge is to just...

178
00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:54.846
ignore him.

179
00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:57.815
Besides, I've got a trust fund.

180
00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.175
Worst-case scenario-
I'll live off my mum.

181
00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:03.845
I don't need his money.

182
00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:07.256
Yeah, but one can always use
some extra walking-around money.

183
00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:10.021
Not if I have to sell my soul.

184
00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:15.092
But, if you had to, at least try to get
as much out of him as you can.

185
00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:18.600
My gosh. What if you actually
had to get a job sometime?

186
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.517
Police escort...

187
00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:34.941
sorta.

188
00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:44.219
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

189
00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:47.825
<i>from the flight deck, we have a very
full flight to Houston this morning.</i>

190
00:12:48.148 --> 00:12:50.212
Uh, excuse me, sir.

191
00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:53.069
Can I- Can I see
your boarding pass again?

192
00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.708
Thank you.

193
00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.676
Yeah. See, this is, uh-
I'm sorry. This is for coach.

194
00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.679
Nah. That's impossible.

195
00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:04.611
No. It's, uh, 32B.

196
00:13:04.835 --> 00:13:06.435
Well, change it.

197
00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:08.686
We can't- Please.

198
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.889
We can't- No.
Thanks a lot.

199
00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:14.653
We can't change it.
It's a "Q" fare. You can't upgrade.

200
00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:17.560
- So, can we-
- Do you have any idea who I am?

201
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.664
I- I know exactly who you are.

202
00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:24.535
You're the guy in Seat 32B.
Here we go.

203
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.909
<i>Conversay to Jason Stevens.</i>

204
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.776
Hello, Jason.

205
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:41.046
What is this, one of those things
Aunt Martha had to wear?

206
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.817
I see you're at the, uh,
Houston airport.

207
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.024
Uh, Baggage Claim.

208
00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:52.794
You got a problem?

209
00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:55.698
You don't look like
you've worked a day in your life.

210
00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:57.759
Great.
The Amazing Kreskin.

211
00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.938
I'm don't know what I'm supposed
to be doing, because no one's been-

212
00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:02.373
Hey!

213
00:14:02.997 --> 00:14:04.243
Hey!

214
00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.411
I'm Gus.

215
00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:08.835
I'm your ride. Get in.

216
00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.425
I'm sorry about
your grandfather's passin'.

217
00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:24.526
He and I go way back.

218
00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:27.028
He was some man.

219
00:14:27.352 --> 00:14:29.452
He loved to work.

220
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:32.430
The man just loved hard work.

221
00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:34.905
Right. Mind if I smoke?

222
00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.738
Ah, it's a free country.

223
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.612
Can you stop at the
next convenience store?

224
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.650
Convenience store?

225
00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:45.717
Please.

226
00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.585
The last store was
about 50 miles back.

227
00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:52.388
We've been on my property
for the last 30 minutes or so.

228
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.857
Well, seein' as how
you're Red's grandson...

229
00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:02.497
you'll stay in
the main house with us.

230
00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:06.868
I know it ain't much. The
little lady just wanted a modest place.

231
00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:10.532
Dinner's in an hour.
Breakfast at 5:00.

232
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.544
Uh, Gus?

233
00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:15.908
Aren't you forgetting something?

234
00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:17.882
I don't think so. Shoot.

235
00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:19.518
The gift.

236
00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:29.484
So this is hell.

237
00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:12.499
Hey, city boy.
Breakfast is over.

238
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.872
Don't you have some kind
of gizmo to wake you up?

239
00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:18.343
Beat it.

240
00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:33.754
Good morning.

241
00:16:34.278 --> 00:16:36.278
What is your problem!

242
00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:50.638
Time to get to work.
The sun'll be up soon.

243
00:16:53.809 --> 00:16:55.239
Let's go!

244
00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.707
Your granddad and I
started out together...

245
00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:02.477
wildcattin' oil wells
down in Louisiana.

246
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.880
Made some money.
We each bought cattle spreads...

247
00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:07.692
as a hedge against
the oil runnin' out.

248
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.087
Of course, he really made it.

249
00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:13.463
- Nice to own your own little
piece of Texas, right?  - Right.

250
00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:42.927
Just from there-

251
00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:45.229
eight feet from the centre.

252
00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:46.888
What?

253
00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:50.464
Lunch will be sent
'round about 11:00.

254
00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.330
Well, how far
am I supposed to go?

255
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.942
Don't worry.

256
00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.842
You'll run out of posts
before you run out of Texas.

257
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.174
I wish I had a dollar for every
fence post I've ever set.

258
00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.586
Matter of fact, I do.

259
00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:15.619
Hey.

260
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.658
What do you think?

261
00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:31.669
No! Hey!

262
00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:33.336
Aw!

263
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.260
Come on, man!

264
00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.433
<i>So, I'm dying to know.
What did you get?</i>

265
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.605
Uh, it's complicated,
but it involves land...

266
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.377
building materials and slave labour.

267
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.918
<i>They're giving you
a shopping mall?</i>

268
00:19:48.386 --> 00:19:50.048
Not exactly.

269
00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:53.282
<i>So it must be the land, right?
They're giving that to you?</i>

270
00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:56.190
Uh, land's got a lot to do with it, yeah.

271
00:19:56.214 --> 00:19:58.062
<i>You don't sound too sure.</i>

272
00:19:58.063 --> 00:20:01.929
Well, whatever it is, I gotta
survive this geriatric cowboy...

273
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.961
until he gives it to me
or when I get back or-

274
00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.508
or when I'm finished.

275
00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.410
<i>Finish what?</i>

276
00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.978
You know what?
Let me get back to you, okay?

277
00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.081
<i>Jason, what are you-</i>

278
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.082
So that's it.

279
00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:41.332
Yeah.

280
00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.626
Let's go.

281
00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.485
I'm not done.

282
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:15.122
Work's never done on a ranch.

283
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:33.240
All right. Whatever.

284
00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:05.344
You know, you do any work
like you just did...

285
00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:08.077
you can do anything.

286
00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:22.059
Now, aren't you
forgettin' something?

287
00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:24.234
I don't think so. Shoot.

288
00:23:24.258 --> 00:23:26.003
The gift.

289
00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:28.737
I came here to pick up a gift.
Remember?

290
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.271
That was the gift?

291
00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:40.013
I do manual labour
for a month...

292
00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:43.851
and you're trying to tell me
it was a favour - to me.

293
00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.288
- The gift of work.
- Wow.

294
00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:48.690
- Congratulations.
- Look, Hamilton.

295
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.786
Just tell me what my
total inheritance is. I'm over this.

296
00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:56.824
Where are you going?
Where is he going?

297
00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:58.893
Can you tell him
to come back, please?

298
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.462
Mr. Hamilton.
Mr. Hamilton.

299
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.331
Hey.

300
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.868
Mr. Hamilton, sir.
Please.

301
00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:12.745
I think it's only fair I know the amount
of money we're dealing with here.
Don't you?

302
00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:14.752
I've been gone for a month.

303
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.717
Just tell me-
What do I have to do? What is it?

304
00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:20.858
Red said, "a series of gifts."

305
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:23.560
But let me add
a personal note.

306
00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:26.495
I, too, think
this is a waste of time.

307
00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:30.262
But it will end shortly,
because you are going to fail.

308
00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:33.463
I expect you to fail
and to fail miserably.

309
00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.563
Now, if you do
want to continue...

310
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.304
make an appointment
with Miss Hastings.

311
00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:43.181
Okay. Look. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Hamilton.

312
00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:49.951
I've been acting like a moron
about this whole thing, and I'm sorry.

313
00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:53.680
And now I- I see exactly what
you and Red have in store for me...

314
00:24:53.758 --> 00:24:56.183
and I think it's
exceedingly beneficial.

315
00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.987
So, what's the next gift?

316
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:03.267
You'll know.

317
00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.286
Howdy.

318
00:25:37.635 --> 00:25:38.871
Wait!

319
00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:40.395
Wait!

320
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:43.235
That's an $8,000 paint job!

321
00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:49.972
You don't begin to live
until you've lost everything.

322
00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.516
Heck, I've lost everything
three or four times.

323
00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:55.078
It's the perfect place to start.

324
00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:57.517
Now, for most
of your adult life...

325
00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.921
you have been
the life of the party...

326
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:03.192
and an easy touch
for a lot of weak hangers-on.

327
00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:06.357
Now let's see who
your real friends are.

328
00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:10.262
I was at your funeral,

329
00:26:10.286 --> 00:26:13.686
and there wasn't a single person there,
who wasn't on your payroll

330
00:26:13.737 --> 00:26:16.637
or didn't have something
to gain from your death.

331
00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:19.370
What exactly is he
asking me to do?

332
00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:22.143
He wants you to come back
at the end of the month...

333
00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.241
with one true friend.

334
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.957
Thank you.

335
00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:40.397
- And how were the lobster tails?
- It was fine, thanks.

336
00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:43.625
The lady was enjoying
the Montrachet.

337
00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.369
And sir, the Margaux.

338
00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.342
I hope it met
your expectations.

339
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.471
It was terrific.
Thank you.

340
00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:58.710
We don't get too many requests
for the '78.

341
00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:02.282
It's a bit too pricey
for some of our patrons.

342
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.849
I'll just leave this with you then.

343
00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:16.158
Caitlin, where do you
see our relationship?

344
00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:20.495
What are you asking me,
Jason Stevens?

345
00:27:20.519 --> 00:27:21.972
Just thinking.

346
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.518
How long have we
been going out?

347
00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:27.206
An appropriate amount of time.

348
00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:29.677
- Long enough.
- See? My thoughts exactly.

349
00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:32.978
I was thinking that
maybe it's time to take us...

350
00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:34.928
more seriously.

351
00:27:34.952 --> 00:27:36.215
Yes?

352
00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:38.988
But there's something
I want to ask you first.

353
00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:42.491
Jason, if you're talking about a
prenup, isn't that sort of passé?

354
00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:45.657
Well, see, I'm in-
I was thinking-

355
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.962
Excuse me, sir.

356
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.824
The charge card company
declined the charge.

357
00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:55.033
That's impossible. I don't have a
credit limit. Just run it through again.

358
00:27:55.406 --> 00:27:58.464
It's always our practice
to run it through again...

359
00:27:58.543 --> 00:28:00.434
but they declined.

360
00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.215
Okay.

361
00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.243
So, I was thinking, um...

362
00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:11.783
well, maybe, it'd be a good time
for me to move in with you.

363
00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:16.225
Uh, you move in with me? Why?
Half my wardrobe's at your penthouse.

364
00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:20.128
Just for a change of scenery.
Besides, I'm remodelling my place.

365
00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:23.827
A remodel? But-Who's your designer?
I know everyone in town.

366
00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:26.803
I should've said
I'm beginning to remodel.

367
00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:29.901
I've only really started
with the demolition.

368
00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:34.543
I'm sorry, sir.
Your bank is on the line.

369
00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:36.637
They'd really like to
speak with you. I must insist.

370
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.808
Look, guys. I'm having
a little bit of a setback.

371
00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:41.710
It's nothing that can't be fixed.
All right?

372
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:48.249
Sweetie, I'm...

373
00:28:48.273 --> 00:28:50.673
switching accounts right now and I'm...

374
00:28:50.727 --> 00:28:52.787
temporarily out of money.

375
00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:55.730
Is there a way
you could pay for this?

376
00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.668
Jason, you're, um-

377
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.801
You're, uh...

378
00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:12.809
asking me to pay the bill?

379
00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.317
It's-

380
00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.619
You owe me.

381
00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.225
What?

382
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.932
Yo, dude, I'm rollin' over.

383
00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.036
What do you mean
I can't?

384
00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:36.140
I have been there for you
countless times.

385
00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.838
You owe me. That's it.
Bottom line.

386
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.174
Who was the one who loaned you
10 grand last year?

387
00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:43.806
I could come up with a better excuse
when I was 12 years old.

388
00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:46.908
All I need is a place to sleep.
I don't get what the problem is.

389
00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:49.681
You can let me spend the night.
One night. Hello?

390
00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:52.245
<i>Sorry. Your service
has been disconnected...</i>

391
00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:54.724
- Can I help you?
- No. Nothing, thanks.

392
00:29:54.748 --> 00:29:56.348
Yeah, shut up.

393
00:30:06.136 --> 00:30:07.370
Jason.

394
00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:09.565
Um- Uh,
what a surprise.

395
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.301
- Mum, you're never gonna believe this.
- I'm afraid I can't let you in.

396
00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.511
I'm having a bit of a situation.
I need some help.

397
00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:20.417
- I need to borrow some money.
- Of course you do. Everyone needs money.

398
00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:22.015
Uh-

399
00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:25.854
Didn't your grandfather
leave you anything?

400
00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:28.688
What are you talking about?
He hated me.

401
00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.628
Jason, he did not.

402
00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:35.064
He didn't come around much, but, uh,
I always thought it was because of me.

403
00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:37.560
It doesn't matter. Do you
have any extra spending cash?

404
00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:40.263
I would love to help you.

405
00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:42.904
- But I can't.
- You can't?

406
00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:46.000
They told me specifically that you
would be comin' around for money...

407
00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:48.068
and that I was not
to give you anything.

408
00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:51.115
But I'm your son, Mum.
That's what you're supposed to do.

409
00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.844
If I violate their instructions...

410
00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:56.285
I am out everything-

411
00:30:56.309 --> 00:30:57.354
everything.

412
00:30:57.355 --> 00:31:00.051
So, for the sake
of the greater good...

413
00:31:00.124 --> 00:31:02.358
I must insist that you leave.

414
00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.618
I'm not gonna upset
the whole apple cart

415
00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.926
just because you're facing
a few challenges.

416
00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:08.200
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:08.724 --> 00:31:11.124
I just cannot help you.

418
00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:12.633
Thanks.

419
00:31:31.053 --> 00:31:32.247
Ow!

420
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.010
Hey, man. You're-
You're on my bench.

421
00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.040
You're on my bench.

422
00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:02.886
Beat it.

423
00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:06.022
A simple "no" would have sufficed.

424
00:32:06.046 --> 00:32:07.291
Fine. No.

425
00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:10.923
- No, what?
- No, you cannot sit on this bench.

426
00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:13.256
This is not your bench.
This is a city bench.

427
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:16.391
- Go sit on another bench.
- But it's my bench.

428
00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:18.765
I've got just as much
right to it as anybody.

429
00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:21.004
It's a free country,
you know.

430
00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:23.306
See, that's where you're wrong.

431
00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:25.672
Name one thing
in this country that's for free.

432
00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:28.678
You need money for everything.
Without money, you're nothing.

433
00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:31.180
Look at you.
No money. No food.

434
00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.217
No family. No friends.
Nothing.

435
00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:36.151
Besides, I'm sitting
on this bench now.

436
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.481
This is my bench.
Okay?

437
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.794
I'll flip you for it.

438
00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.130
Fine.

439
00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:58.168
I have a quarter.

440
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.270
Thanks.

441
00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:09.620


442
00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:14.658
Well, aren't you gonna
chase him for it?

443
00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.817
Beat it, kid.

444
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.362
I've been watching you.
You're not a real bum.

445
00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:22.858
We saw you at a funeral.

446
00:33:23.082 --> 00:33:25.082
Quite the entrance.

447
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.798
- What were you doing at the...
- My mother and I come here
for lunch every day.

448
00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:31.637
Except, right now,
she doesn't know where I am.

449
00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:33.140
Emily!

450
00:33:33.564 --> 00:33:35.012
Whatever.

451
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:36.649
Emily!

452
00:33:36.673 --> 00:33:38.515
Oh! Emily.

453
00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:42.077
- You must really be having a bad life.
- Come on. Right now.

454
00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:45.047
I was just having a pleasant
conversation with this gentleman.

455
00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:49.589
- Leave us alone, please.
- Dear, don't be ridiculous.
Sorry to disturb you. Come on.

456
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.821
That's okay. I'm not the one
who's disturbed.

457
00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.864
Some friend you are.

458
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:55.865
Thanks a lot, poser.

459
00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:58.060
You know what I've said
about talking to strangers.

460
00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:01.369
- He's not a real bum.
- Hey. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

461
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:04.372
Okay, this is gonna sound
really, really strange...

462
00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:06.842
but I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

463
00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:09.675
I'll make a deal with you.
I need a friend.

464
00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:12.341
But only for a little while,
and, uh...

465
00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:15.654
in return, I don't know,
I'll take you...

466
00:34:15.678 --> 00:34:17.621
both to Disney World.

467
00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.123
Excuse me?

468
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:22.092
I need a friend.

469
00:34:22.116 --> 00:34:23.860
Explain yourself.

470
00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.361
It's complicated.

471
00:34:25.385 --> 00:34:27.585
No, it's not

472
00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:29.598
It's pathetic.

473
00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:32.830
- Come on. Now, just because-
- Mum, I told you.

474
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:35.203
- He's not a real bum.
- Okay.

475
00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:39.008
Oh, dude, come on.

476
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.799
She doesn't even like
Châteauneuf du Pape.

477
00:35:07.403 --> 00:35:08.701
Thank you.

478
00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:12.072
Miss Hastings,
bring me the Stevens file.

479
00:35:12.743 --> 00:35:16.008
Looks like our boy's not even
gonna make it through round two.

480
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.907
But, sir...

481
00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:21.540
doesn't he have until
the end of today?

482
00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:23.753
Well, from what I hear...

483
00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:27.187
he could have another month
and still get the same result.

484
00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.652
Yes, sir.

485
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:34.724
- So, what do you think? Is this
a good spot?  - Yeah, perfect.

486
00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:37.359
You can see everything
under the perfect tree.

487
00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:40.063
- Hey! Hey! Give that back!
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm just hungry.

488
00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:42.606
- Sir, you need to step back.
- Don't you have a sandwich?

489
00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:44.664
- You need to step back.
- Leave her alone.

490
00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:47.210
Get back! Get back!
I've got 911 all dialled in.

491
00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:49.576
All I have to do is press "Send."
Sweetheart, get back.

492
00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:52.744
- Ow! No!
- Hey! Hey! Leave 'em alone.

493
00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.693
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

494
00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:05.394
Whoo!

495
00:36:05.418 --> 00:36:06.864
Yeah.

496
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.758
My bench.

497
00:36:12.002 --> 00:36:13.202
Mwah!

498
00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:17.098
- So, you have a bet with a dead guy?
- Mm-hm.

499
00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:20.310
- Cool.
- Emily. Be polite.

500
00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:23.745
Wait. How can you have a bet with a...
deceased person?

501
00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:26.248
See, that's the part
that's complicated.

502
00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.751
So, you come up with a friend.

503
00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:31.879
What do you get if we
go along with this?

504
00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:34.383
- Emily.
- No, it's okay.

505
00:36:34.407 --> 00:36:36.059
I don't know.

506
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.560
Something about an ultimate gift

507
00:36:38.584 --> 00:36:39.930
or something.

508
00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:41.922
But you're not sure what that is.

509
00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:44.297
Yeah, that about sums it up.

510
00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:47.098
So what do we get
if we agree to do this?

511
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:50.973
- We need money. How much
are you willing to pay?  - Emily!

512
00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:54.378
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to excuse my daughter.

513
00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.081
Sometimes she...

514
00:36:56.105 --> 00:36:58.505
tends to be a little outspoken.

515
00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:04.487
I can't promise you anything.

516
00:37:06.657 --> 00:37:08.682
Now, that's better.

517
00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.058
But

518
00:37:10.082 --> 00:37:12.482
what if we really did...

519
00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:16.493
become friends?

520
00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:31.313
- Emily, it's not polite-
- Shh.

521
00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.323
So you're Jason's friend?

522
00:37:40.347 --> 00:37:42.447
Yes, I am.

523
00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.622
- True friend?
- Absolutely.

524
00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:48.392
Pinky promise.

525
00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:51.026
So, how long have you
known Mr. Stevens?

526
00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.304
We go way back.

527
00:37:53.328 --> 00:37:55.328
We're like this.

528
00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:58.498
Now, where do I sign?

529
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.004
And, uh...

530
00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.847
he hasn't promised you any
compensation for this friendship?

531
00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.807
Look at him.

532
00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:10.816
Does he look like
he has anything to offer?

533
00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.151
So, uh...

534
00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:20.296
you expect this friendship
to continue?

535
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.147
I plan on knowing Jason
for the rest of my life.

536
00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:36.210
Tomorrow- lunch at noon,
our usual spot in the park.

537
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.776
Sure.

538
00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:42.886
Just a minute, pal!

539
00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:45.017
You owe me.

540
00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:54.462
Emily. Wait.

541
00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:59.395
- They go back a long way, don't they?
- Mm.

542
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:03.730
There was a time when
Mr. Hamilton was quite ill...

543
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.272
and needed
a kidney transplant.

544
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.209
Your grandfather

545
00:39:08.233 --> 00:39:11.533
went out of his way
to help him find a donor.

546
00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:14.674
You could even say, I think,
that Mr. Hamilton's alive today...

547
00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:16.986
because of Red Stevens.

548
00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:21.291
Um.

549
00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:25.993
In the, um, basement
of this building...

550
00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:28.529
there's a small apartment
for a custodian.

551
00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:30.533
It isn't being used right now.

552
00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:33.667
Perhaps you'd, um,
like to take a look at it?

553
00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.075
Thank you.

554
00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:43.179
Jason, you have no concept
whatsoever of the value of money.

555
00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:47.314
Money has always been available to you,
like the air you breathe.

556
00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:52.413
I tell you, let's, uh, review some
highlights of your recent past.

557
00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:59.128
A $25,000-per-night suite in Paris...

558
00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:02.727
with a personal chef
whom you tipped heavily.

559
00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:07.662
Toured the Bordeaux region
in chauffeured hot-air balloons.

560
00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:09.668
That was amazing.

561
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.440
A week of heli-skiing
in Saint Moritz.

562
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.774
A small fleet
of exotic cars.

563
00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:18.044
The latest in everything,
including women.

564
00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:21.644
But the past is the past...

565
00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:24.920
and I figure you've probably had
a pretty tough month.

566
00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:32.192
Well, it's about time.
Thank you very much.

567
00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:35.331
And if I ever
see you two again...

568
00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:37.433
it'll be too soon.

569
00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:54.513
Well, seeing how you've never
held one of those before...

570
00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:56.519
let me explain what it is.

571
00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:59.987
That's a pay cheque. That's for
what you earned at Gus's ranch.

572
00:41:00.058 --> 00:41:03.086
Of course, the I.R.S. ravaged it first.
I hate those guys.

573
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.151
In your pocket
every step of the way.

574
00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:08.323
You start out in business,
and then you have to make a payroll.

575
00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:10.390
And just when you think
you're gonna make a-

576
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:13.130
Mr. Stevens, this is the
"Gift of Money," please.

577
00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:15.231
Yeah, all right. Sorry.

578
00:41:15.255 --> 00:41:16.806
Look at me.

579
00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:21.245
I'm carrying on about
death and taxes even after I'm dead.

580
00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:25.771
Now, you have to take that money and
as much as you need it yourself-

581
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.208
spend it on someone
experiencing a real problem.

582
00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:31.445
What can they teach you?

583
00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.752
Put yourself in their shoes.

584
00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:37.052
Jason, would you like us
to cash it for you?

585
00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.461
Please.

586
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.660
I think we know you
well enough that

587
00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:45.129
we won't need any I.D.

588
00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:48.097
How will you know how I spent it?

589
00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:52.075
We'll know.

590
00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.552
Hey.

591
00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:06.422
I didn't
take anything.

592
00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.581
Nothin'. Nothin'.

593
00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:23.139
Oh, no.

594
00:42:26.175 --> 00:42:27.405
Great.

595
00:42:56.306 --> 00:42:57.797
Naturally.

596
00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.100
A young blonde woman
and her little girl.

597
00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:02.168
- Just down the hall.
- Thanks.

598
00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:04.237
<i>Paging Dr. Howard. Dr. Howard.</i>

599
00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:06.780
<i>Paging Dr. Kline.
Dr. Kline.</i>

600
00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:09.542
<i>Paging Dr. Howard.</i>

601
00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:35.141
What are you doing here?

602
00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:39.482
You saw her.

603
00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:40.626
Yeah.

604
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.681
Did you talk to her?

605
00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:50.088
- So, what's wrong with her?
- That depends.

606
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.751
- On what?
- On who you really are.

607
00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:56.289
Maybe I can help you.

608
00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:59.930
Emily has leukaemia.

609
00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:03.337
We thought she was in remission after
her bone marrow transplant...

610
00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:05.676
but a couple of weeks ago...

611
00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:09.102
her body started
to reject the transplant.

612
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.110
I'm sorry.

613
00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:20.690
Uh, hey.

614
00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.918
Uh, well, you gotta
need money, right?

615
00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:28.562
Oh, so that's it. You won your bet
with your rich grandfather.

616
00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:31.462
You're back off the streets.
Congratulations. What is it now?

617
00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:34.299
Uh, I do have to
give away some money.

618
00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:37.173
You're getting less mysterious
by the minute.

619
00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:41.175
I bet you're gonna get to the end
of your game, collect your cash...

620
00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:43.736
- and just ride off into the sunset.
- I don't know. Maybe.

621
00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:45.875
But, Alexia, if I can help you,

622
00:44:45.899 --> 00:44:47.950
why won't you just let me?

623
00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:49.381
Because no...

624
00:44:49.405 --> 00:44:53.905
rich kid is gonna use me or
my daughter to play a game.

625
00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:09.097
She owes $1,600 in back rent.
Pay it.

626
00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:13.338
You're a hundred dollars short.

627
00:45:13.862 --> 00:45:16.162
Your cheque was for 1,500.

628
00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:19.474
Tell Hamilton I'm good for it.
Just pay that bill.

629
00:45:25.521 --> 00:45:27.615
Your other hundred.

630
00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:31.359
Well, push "Play."

631
00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:34.454
Our lives should be lived
not avoiding problems...

632
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:38.725
but welcoming them as challenges
that will strengthen us...

633
00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:41.869
so that we can be
victorious in the future.

634
00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:46.867
So, now that I've given you the gift of
work and friends and the value of money,

635
00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.335
let's discover the gift of family.

636
00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.404
Now this is a tough one...

637
00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:53.848
but see if it's even
remotely possible...

638
00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:56.750
to get something positive
out of our family.

639
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.921
See if they truly know
how to count their blessings.

640
00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.359
If my doctors
are remotely accurate...

641
00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:06.152
this assignment might even
fall on Thanksgiving.

642
00:46:06.229 --> 00:46:08.120
How appropriate.

643
00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.825
He's joking, right?

644
00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:17.735
<i>Dr. Allen, you're wanted in O.B.</i>

645
00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:20.805
<i>Dr. Allen, please report
to Obstetrics.</i>

646
00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:24.472
- Hey, where's the girl?
- Who, Emily?

647
00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:26.582
She's with God.

648
00:46:33.923 --> 00:46:36.724
Oh, there's my best friend.

649
00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:41.190
Listen, about the other day...

650
00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:44.770
So,

651
00:46:44.994 --> 00:46:47.394
now you know all about me.

652
00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.640
No more mysteries.

653
00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:54.335
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- Shut up.

654
00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:57.203
Don't be pathetic.

655
00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:02.342
I wonder if he takes
advance orders.

656
00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.386
For what?

657
00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:07.380
For my place.

658
00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:09.883
You know, up there.

659
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.961
What do you think it's gonna be like?

660
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.560
Butterflies.

661
00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:18.059
Lots of butterflies.

662
00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:21.100
Did you know, God...

663
00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:25.573
paints every colour on a butterfly
with his fingers.

664
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:29.335
I didn't know you
thought about stuff like that.

665
00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:33.046
I think about dying.

666
00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:37.785
There's something basically unfair
about a person dying.

667
00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:42.014
I even hate the idea.

668
00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:48.831
You know, I, uh-

669
00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:51.933
I don't know much about God or...

670
00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.565
or Jesus.

671
00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:58.931
But I can promise you
that those arms are meant for you.

672
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.509
What's gonna happen to my mum?

673
00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:09.078
I really don't hate her,
you know.

674
00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.126
Did I mention...

675
00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:31.466
I wouldn't be upset
if you kissed her?

676
00:48:36.013 --> 00:48:38.473
Do you think your mum and I-

677
00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:40.708
Okay. It's official.

678
00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:43.815
You are the slowest person
I have ever met.

679
00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:46.817
You two were
made for each other.

680
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.824
I knew that
back in the park.

681
00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:52.353
- In the park, I looked like a bum.
- Let's not be delusional.

682
00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:54.357
You were a bum.

683
00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:56.829
So,

684
00:48:57.653 --> 00:49:00.453
what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

685
00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:08.137
- Mrs. Drummond?
- Yes.

686
00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:12.009
I want to send Emily's charts and
blood work off to a specialist-

687
00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:15.349
see whether or not she's a
candidate for another transplant.

688
00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:20.650
Oh. Uh, will that give her
a better chance than chemo?

689
00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:26.086
Unfortunately, chemotherapy
isn't going to be enough.

690
00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:29.925
I'm sorry.

691
00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.235
Thank you.

692
00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:21.513
So when I found out
I was pregnant...

693
00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:25.622
he was getting ready
to leave for college and, uh...

694
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.154
didn't want anything
to get in his way.

695
00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:32.825
And Emily...

696
00:50:33.949 --> 00:50:35.549
she's...

697
00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:40.459
she's the best decision
I ever made.

698
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:46.804
So, apparently...

699
00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:51.370
someone came by
and covered my back rent.

700
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.142
Was it you?

701
00:50:56.419 --> 00:50:57.916
Thank you.

702
00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:04.961
I have a question for you, and
I hope I'm not being out of line here.

703
00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:07.428
I was wondering if you'd like
to join me for Thanksgiving.

704
00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:09.923
Oh. Um, thanks.

705
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.068
That's nice of you to ask,
but I can't.

706
00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:16.505
Um, obviously,
Emily needs me here, so...

707
00:51:16.529 --> 00:51:17.929
But thanks.

708
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:20.066
Well, it's too bad,
because you're missing out

709
00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:23.772
on a splendid example
of a way-too-wealthy American...

710
00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.945
dysfunctional thing.

711
00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:28.516
- It's-Yeah.
- Oh.

712
00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:32.121
You know, I have the strangest
feeling I might have enjoyed it.

713
00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:40.827
What are you thinking about?

714
00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:42.431
Nothin'.

715
00:51:43.199 --> 00:51:46.063
You're thinking about Jason.

716
00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.381
Yeah. He's weird, isn't he?

717
00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.540
He's a good weird.

718
00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:05.186
You know, he, uh, invited me...

719
00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:08.119
over to Thanksgiving
with his family.

720
00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.823
Oh, really?

721
00:52:10.847 --> 00:52:13.847
Yeah. Of course, I told him,
"Whatever, loser."

722
00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:17.491
I think you should go.

723
00:52:17.515 --> 00:52:19.515
Absolutely not.

724
00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:25.701
I wouldn't dream of missing
Thanksgiving with you.

725
00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:30.709
So why'd you decide to come?

726
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.417
My daughter banished me.

727
00:52:33.441 --> 00:52:34.841
Oh.

728
00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:37.549
So I have you by decree.

729
00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:40.181
Mm, knowing Emily-
by design.

730
00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:42.191
Mission accomplished.

731
00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:44.420
Two completely
opposite people...

732
00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:46.894
who wouldn't have had
a chance without me...

733
00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:49.788
destined to make
each other miserable.

734
00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.135
You okay, Jason?

735
00:52:58.108 --> 00:53:01.341
Oh. Don't tell me you've
never been on a bus before.

736
00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.526
Wow.

737
00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:19.521
Brace yourself.

738
00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.995
Jason, seriously.

739
00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:25.997
I'm willing to bet that they are
perfectly normal people.

740
00:53:26.021 --> 00:53:27.821
Oh, yeah? How much?

741
00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:49.116
This is nice.

742
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:53.329
Thank you.

743
00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:56.893
You know, I had my firm
do an informal audit-

744
00:53:57.767 --> 00:54:00.594
just the financials
of the publicly held side.

745
00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:04.565
And there's still several
hundred million floatin' around.

746
00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:08.010
Well, you knew him better than I.

747
00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:11.170
Most of those companies
were privately held.

748
00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:14.745
Maybe we should check into
some of his favourite charities.

749
00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:18.253
- They do have to report large
contributions.  - That's a great idea.

750
00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:21.415
Daddy always was a sucker
for a begging hand.

751
00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:23.887
Hm. Unfortunately,

752
00:54:24.111 --> 00:54:25.761
you're right.

753
00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:29.364
And what sort of business
does your family come from, Alexia?

754
00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.000
Um,

755
00:54:31.024 --> 00:54:32.668
health care.

756
00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.696
Oh, how wonderful.

757
00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:37.362
Well, we have a wing
in the hospital downtown.

758
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.374
A couple of wings, I think.

759
00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.676
Or is it a couple of hospitals?

760
00:54:41.844 --> 00:54:43.878
I always forget.

761
00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.743
My daughter is receiving
great care thanks to your father.

762
00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:49.150
Great sector-health care.

763
00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:52.819
Little flat in the third quarter,
but poised to rocket.

764
00:54:53.989 --> 00:54:57.017
Okay. I'd like to propose a toast.

765
00:54:57.493 --> 00:55:00.159
Yes. To each other.

766
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:04.396
For suffering through a year
of great adjustment.

767
00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.861
Uh, excuse me.

768
00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:09.901
Does anyone else seem to notice
it smells a little like...

769
00:55:09.972 --> 00:55:11.997
cowhide in here?

770
00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:16.772
And how are those sin stocks
of yours doing, Jack?

771
00:55:16.847 --> 00:55:20.375
What's wrong with a little investment
in alcohol, tobacco and firearms?

772
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.517
Over the stench of oil?

773
00:55:22.541 --> 00:55:25.541
And what's wrong with oil,
thank you very much?

774
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:29.422
My money is just as green
in Manhattan as anywhere else.

775
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.026
So...

776
00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:37.050
who does get the rest of the estate?

777
00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:39.365
Sarah?

778
00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:43.267
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

779
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.803
Well, you were
the last one in there.

780
00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:50.974
- No, I wasn't.
- Well, that's just ridiculous, darling.

781
00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:53.277
When we left, you were
the only one there.

782
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.017
Well,

783
00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:57.541
Jason was also there.

784
00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:02.287
- Ah. Jason.
- Do enlighten us, Jason.

785
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:04.418
You certainly could not
have been the one

786
00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:06.854
that received the bulk
of Red's estate.

787
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.264
Or are you?

788
00:56:08.288 --> 00:56:11.488
Is that why you insisted we
get together for Thanksgiving-

789
00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:15.033
so you could reveal your
newly enhanced trust fund to us?

790
00:56:15.104 --> 00:56:16.664
It's Thanksgiving.

791
00:56:16.688 --> 00:56:19.388
I was hoping maybe we could
all go around the table

792
00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:22.210
and each say something
that we're most thankful for.

793
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:30.218
- Are you on crack, Jason?
- Again?

794
00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:33.618
Well, here's a thanks.

795
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:37.489
We don't have to put up with Dad's
endless litany of clichéd quotes
this season.

796
00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.595
Or hand-spun, cornpone wisdom.

797
00:56:40.863 --> 00:56:42.389
Hear! Hear!

798
00:56:43.766 --> 00:56:45.566
Who is that?

799
00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:48.161
I think he works
down at the video store.

800
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.732
Well, Jason

801
00:56:49.756 --> 00:56:52.856
will tell you all you need to know
about this man...

802
00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:55.645
this... dearly departed.

803
00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:58.180
I mean, he more
than anyone here

804
00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:01.283
has a bone to pick with
the late, great Red Stevens.

805
00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:05.244
<i>Jason, I can only imagine
what you've just been through.</i>

806
00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:08.181
<i>I could never get them to be
thankful for anything either.</i>

807
00:57:08.205 --> 00:57:09.458
What have you got?

808
00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:11.620
- Hey!
- What in the world is that?

809
00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:13.928
All right, give it back.

810
00:57:14.052 --> 00:57:16.098
Pass it to me. Come on.

811
00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:18.727
- Give it back!
- <i>...and if you do succeed...</i>

812
00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:20.095
Here. Take it!

813
00:57:20.119 --> 00:57:22.819
<i>you'll be one step closer
to all I have for you.</i>

814
00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:25.368
What's "all I have for you"?

815
00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:28.133
It's between him and me.
It's none of your business.

816
00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.579
It has everything to do with us.

817
00:57:30.603 --> 00:57:32.147
It's our money!

818
00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:34.742
So he's making you work
for your inheritance?

819
00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:38.181
Not anymore, 'cause I don't
think I could ever win at this one.

820
00:57:38.255 --> 00:57:40.080
Alexia, let's go.

821
00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.424
Jason. Wait.

822
00:57:44.448 --> 00:57:45.894
- Wait!
- Don't!

823
00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.986
Just tell them
what they want to hear.

824
00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:50.362
I don't have to tell them anything.

825
00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:53.732
Jason, you're gonna hear
from my attorney Monday morning.

826
00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:56.467
- Yeah. Ditto.
- Shut up, Jack.

827
00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:00.399
You're all pathetic.

828
00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:03.777
Wait.

829
00:58:03.801 --> 00:58:05.647
Jason, slow down.

830
00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.510
I put up with that for years.
I was a part of that.

831
00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:14.224
What happened to your dad?

832
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:17.789
He's dead. What else
do you want to know?

833
00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:20.629
How'd he die?

834
00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:23.927
The only person who really knows
just took it to his grave.

835
00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:28.231
Jason, there's something
I always want you to remember, okay?

836
00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:30.534
When I met you,
you were a homeless person.

837
00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:33.640
And you made friends
with my daughter.

838
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.342
We shared peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

839
00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:39.680
All this without me knowing
anything about your background.

840
00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:42.813
Yeah, well, the problem is,

841
00:58:42.837 --> 00:58:44.837
that's me back there.

842
00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:48.982
Yeah, but you can walk away from
all that. You already have.

843
00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:53.127
I appreciate what you're saying,
but money changes things.

844
00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:56.333
It gets you stuff. It's a...
it's a way to live life

845
00:58:56.357 --> 00:58:57.900
worry free.

846
00:58:57.901 --> 00:59:00.169
Money takes away the worry.

847
00:59:00.193 --> 00:59:02.593
Yeah, I saw what money can do.

848
00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:05.106
And your worries-

849
00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:07.766
or whatever you want to call them-

850
00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.178
they're not life or death, Jason.

851
00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:11.714
Okay, I'm sorry,

852
00:59:11.738 --> 00:59:14.138
but my getting my inheritance
is a matter of life or death.

853
00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:17.016
And I know when I say that,
I sound like I'm being a Stevens

854
00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:19.020
and being a Stevens
is all about money.

855
00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:21.322
But it's not.
It's more.

856
00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:36.494
So, I'll pay you back
as soon as possible.

857
00:59:38.975 --> 00:59:40.466
What?

858
00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:45.244
Uh, the money I owe you-
the 1,600.

859
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:50.642
Happy Thanksgiving.

860
01:00:16.134 --> 01:00:18.025
Marietta Ruby.

861
01:00:20.405 --> 01:00:23.673
From the time I met her
in the 7th grade...

862
01:00:24.342 --> 01:00:26.403
that was my sweetheart.

863
01:00:27.779 --> 01:00:29.804
She didn't make it easy though.

864
01:00:29.881 --> 01:00:32.948
Took me all the way till the 8th grade
to catch up with her.

865
01:00:33.318 --> 01:00:35.118
She's beautiful.

866
01:00:35.787 --> 01:00:37.221
Yeah.

867
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:40.686
She passed away
shortly after we were married.

868
01:00:43.595 --> 01:00:45.686
I'm really sorry.

869
01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:50.793
The greatest gift she gave me...

870
01:00:51.269 --> 01:00:53.736
was the will to move on...

871
01:00:54.205 --> 01:00:56.096
to overcome.

872
01:00:58.943 --> 01:01:01.812
You know, I may have
met someone myself.

873
01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.038
Then cherish her.

874
01:01:05.517 --> 01:01:08.518
And become the man
she deserves.

875
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.281
Have a seat.

876
01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.994
Now, as I said...

877
01:01:18.062 --> 01:01:20.961
I had a feeling
you were gonna stop by.

878
01:01:24.569 --> 01:01:28.368
That university you attended-
what was it rated? Number three?

879
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.031
Number-three party school
in the country.

880
01:01:33.044 --> 01:01:35.709
Do- Do you truly
know how to learn?

881
01:01:35.981 --> 01:01:38.748
Jason, any process
worth going through...

882
01:01:38.817 --> 01:01:41.652
will get tougher
before it gets easier.

883
01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.121
That's what makes
learning a gift...

884
01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:48.281
even if pain is your teacher.

885
01:02:10.548 --> 01:02:12.812
No. There's no way.

886
01:02:12.884 --> 01:02:14.719
Anywhere but there.

887
01:02:15.887 --> 01:02:18.412
I know what he's trying to do,
and it's not gonna work.

888
01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:20.821
He can take his millions
to his grave. I don't care.

889
01:02:20.892 --> 01:02:24.587
What he's trying to do is for your
benefit, not your destruction.

890
01:02:26.031 --> 01:02:28.725
You know, Hamilton,
you sound just like him.

891
01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.332
But guess what.
You're not him.

892
01:02:32.303 --> 01:02:34.364
I don't know, son.

893
01:02:34.539 --> 01:02:36.837
I do have one of his kidneys.

894
01:02:39.677 --> 01:02:42.168
He's been out there for hours.

895
01:02:42.247 --> 01:02:44.909
Yep. He's got some
big decisions to make.

896
01:02:44.983 --> 01:02:48.019
Do you think he'll come in
or go home?

897
01:02:51.356 --> 01:02:53.347
He doesn't have a home.

898
01:02:53.424 --> 01:02:55.016
You're right!

899
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.040
She hates you!

900
01:02:58.296 --> 01:03:01.327
- I know.
- Then why are you here?

901
01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.198
I have to leave the country
for a while.

902
01:03:04.469 --> 01:03:06.835
I'm reluctant to go because
of what I'm leaving behind.

903
01:03:06.859 --> 01:03:09.089
What are you leaving behind?

904
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.343
Then you have to go.

905
01:03:17.367 --> 01:03:19.567
Now get out of here.

906
01:03:21.185 --> 01:03:23.210
You screwed up big time,
you know!

907
01:03:23.288 --> 01:03:27.290
I had to eat a rubber hospital
turkey for Thanksgiving!

908
01:03:33.598 --> 01:03:36.634
You better be back by Christmas!

909
01:04:24.815 --> 01:04:27.942
Even down here,
you put your name on everything.

910
01:04:28.019 --> 01:04:30.486
Welcome! Oh, welcome!

911
01:04:30.955 --> 01:04:32.789
Jason Stevens.

912
01:04:32.957 --> 01:04:34.358
Oh! Oh!

913
01:04:34.382 --> 01:04:36.382
So good to meet you.

914
01:04:36.427 --> 01:04:37.520
I'm Bella.

915
01:04:37.544 --> 01:04:38.595
Hi.

916
01:04:38.596 --> 01:04:41.392
May I be the first
to show you inside

917
01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:43.816
the library your grandfather built?

918
01:04:45.336 --> 01:04:47.670
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, good, good.

919
01:04:51.142 --> 01:04:53.208
Where are all the books?

920
01:04:53.778 --> 01:04:55.872
Oh.
You joke.

921
01:04:56.447 --> 01:04:58.481
With the people.

922
01:04:59.584 --> 01:05:03.614
Is it not like that in the great
libraries de Los Estados Unidos?

923
01:05:07.892 --> 01:05:10.156
Villagers wait for books.

924
01:05:10.728 --> 01:05:12.719
You bring them new books.

925
01:05:12.797 --> 01:05:15.293
They are waiting for you to

926
01:05:15.317 --> 01:05:17.317
pick up old books.

927
01:05:17.468 --> 01:05:20.127
Exchange. Library. Sí

928
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:29.175
So basically,
I'm in a third world country...

929
01:05:29.247 --> 01:05:31.715
at a backwards library with no books.

930
01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:35.545
And the books that are here,
I can't even read.

931
01:05:36.588 --> 01:05:38.079
Great.

932
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.951
Mm.

933
01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:57.130
This I found when I was
cleaning his desk...

934
01:05:57.508 --> 01:06:00.004
once I heard of Red's passing.

935
01:06:00.278 --> 01:06:02.803
I thought maybe you
would like to keep.

936
01:06:05.283 --> 01:06:07.410
When you sent this to him...

937
01:06:07.485 --> 01:06:10.251
he proudly showed it to all of us.

938
01:06:11.322 --> 01:06:13.413
Then the tragedy.

939
01:06:14.959 --> 01:06:17.050
It broke his heart.

940
01:06:21.065 --> 01:06:22.926
Dear Grandpa...

941
01:06:23.301 --> 01:06:25.192
How's Ecuador?

942
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:27.798
I miss you and Dad so much.

943
01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:30.734
You know, my birthday's
coming up, and I was thinking...

944
01:06:30.808 --> 01:06:33.140
instead of giving me gifts
this year...

945
01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:35.645
could you take me
on one of your trips?

946
01:06:35.713 --> 01:06:38.382
I promise I won't
cause any trouble.

947
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.417
I just want to see you
and Dad again soon.

948
01:06:41.686 --> 01:06:44.314
Write back, please.
Love, Jason.

949
01:07:01.873 --> 01:07:03.241
Hola.

950
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:20.981
Un momento, por favour.

951
01:07:22.961 --> 01:07:25.220
You look just like your father.

952
01:07:28.132 --> 01:07:30.366
I was here the night he died.

953
01:07:37.041 --> 01:07:39.532
It happened up on that mountain,
didn't it?

954
01:07:42.447 --> 01:07:44.438
- Take me there.
- You cannot go.

955
01:07:44.515 --> 01:07:46.449
It is now the province
of the drug lords.

956
01:07:46.517 --> 01:07:48.542
You don't understand.

957
01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.922
I'll pay you.

958
01:07:50.946 --> 01:07:52.946
Well, someday.

959
01:07:53.091 --> 01:07:56.788
I understand perfectly.
But, señor, I only have one life.

960
01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:59.425
You're just bargaining now,
aren't you?

961
01:07:59.449 --> 01:08:01.009
Senor Stevens,

962
01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:04.233
you do not want to
pay the price it would take.

963
01:08:04.235 --> 01:08:07.327
No one who goes there returns.

964
01:08:11.376 --> 01:08:13.946
Our guest of honour,

965
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:16.470
Mr. Jason Stevens!

966
01:08:33.898 --> 01:08:35.992
Oh.
Gracias.

967
01:08:37.468 --> 01:08:39.363
I'm afraid to ask.

968
01:08:39.437 --> 01:08:41.528
Oh, you will love it.

969
01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:43.901
It's so rare we catch one.

970
01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:46.602
The chief is going to talk.

971
01:08:46.626 --> 01:08:47.826
Oh.

972
01:08:55.887 --> 01:08:58.947
He says we are here
to celebrate you...

973
01:08:59.023 --> 01:09:02.686
and those who keep
the Jay Stevens Library alive.

974
01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.228
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

975
01:09:05.296 --> 01:09:07.526
No. No. No, no, no.

976
01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:09.499
He must be mistaken.

977
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.435
My grandfather was very generous.
Everything's named after him.

978
01:09:12.503 --> 01:09:16.772
No, it is the Jay Stevens
Memorial Library.

979
01:09:29.807 --> 01:09:31.498
To my father.

980
01:09:31.522 --> 01:09:33.547
- Salud.
- Salud.

981
01:09:40.864 --> 01:09:42.661
Have some more.

982
01:09:45.436 --> 01:09:47.461
- Salud.
- Salud.

983
01:09:47.538 --> 01:09:49.169
Salud!

984
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.998
Salud.

985
01:10:41.192 --> 01:10:43.824
You cannot hope
to find it without me.

986
01:10:44.529 --> 01:10:46.690
How'd you know I'd go?

987
01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:49.262
You are a Stevens, are you not?

988
01:10:49.634 --> 01:10:52.228
I thought you said
you couldn't take me.

989
01:10:53.838 --> 01:10:57.435
My purpose in coming to you
was a promise I made to Senor Red-

990
01:10:59.544 --> 01:11:01.512
that you could learn the truth.

991
01:11:01.579 --> 01:11:04.106
He had one desire
and one desire alone-

992
01:11:04.181 --> 01:11:06.415
to ask your forgiveness.

993
01:11:11.756 --> 01:11:14.316
He said one day you would come.

994
01:11:14.392 --> 01:11:16.583
Only then you could
learn the truth.

995
01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.158
Stop! Stop the jeep.

996
01:13:10.341 --> 01:13:13.374
He had learned of a village
in the next valley...

997
01:13:13.744 --> 01:13:16.610
that had a plague and
needed medical supplies.

998
01:13:17.848 --> 01:13:20.749
But he never understood
why Red forbid him to go.

999
01:13:20.818 --> 01:13:22.815
There was no plague.

1000
01:13:22.939 --> 01:13:24.987
There was no village.

1001
01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:26.484
What?

1002
01:13:27.358 --> 01:13:31.055
Red wanted to introduce
your father to the oil business.

1003
01:13:31.128 --> 01:13:33.192
But your father...

1004
01:13:33.964 --> 01:13:36.159
was restless and bored.

1005
01:13:36.233 --> 01:13:38.633
- No. No.
- He snuck away. He ran away...

1006
01:13:38.703 --> 01:13:41.103
- and took a plane he had
no business taking. - No.

1007
01:13:41.172 --> 01:13:44.670
This is what Red wanted
to protect you from. 'Til now.

1008
01:13:44.843 --> 01:13:47.668
There can be no blame
for what happened here.

1009
01:13:48.045 --> 01:13:50.741
The penalty for
your father's impulsiveness...

1010
01:13:50.815 --> 01:13:52.942
unfortunately, was a life-

1011
01:13:53.717 --> 01:13:55.217
his.

1012
01:14:12.336 --> 01:14:14.167
Americano

1013
01:14:43.367 --> 01:14:44.631


1014
01:15:51.001 --> 01:15:55.500
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times...

1015
01:15:56.073 --> 01:15:58.772
"it was the age of wisdom...

1016
01:15:59.443 --> 01:16:02.341
it was the age of foolishness."

1017
01:16:05.983 --> 01:16:08.008
Can't you find him?

1018
01:16:08.185 --> 01:16:11.680
We think that he went searching
for the crash site...

1019
01:16:11.856 --> 01:16:14.222
which is in lawless territory.

1020
01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:16.556
I'm sorry. Crash site?

1021
01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.980
Where his father died.

1022
01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.797
Well, I mean, is- is he in any danger?

1023
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:28.404
I'm so sorry.

1024
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:36.336
"Neither love, nor hate thy life;

1025
01:16:36.413 --> 01:16:39.349
"but what thou livest, live well...

1026
01:16:39.917 --> 01:16:43.385
however long or short
may the heavens permit."

1027
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.351
Tell me about my father.

1028
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:55.523
In many ways, he was
very similar to you-

1029
01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.701
restless, rebellious, angry.

1030
01:17:01.572 --> 01:17:04.439
I think Red
saw something in him...

1031
01:17:04.508 --> 01:17:07.405
that he didn't see
in his other sons-

1032
01:17:08.279 --> 01:17:10.070
a fire.

1033
01:17:11.282 --> 01:17:14.345
The same fire he sees in you.

1034
01:17:24.228 --> 01:17:26.519
I still don't forgive you.

1035
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:08.334
Amigo? Amigo,
are you here?

1036
01:18:21.251 --> 01:18:24.482
No, no, no! No! No, no!
Please, no! I can- I can pay you!

1037
01:18:24.555 --> 01:18:26.616
I have money! Please!

1038
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:29.483
Oh, God! God! Does anyone
understand what I'm saying?

1039
01:19:41.665 --> 01:19:43.656
"Mueren." "Mueren."

1040
01:19:47.004 --> 01:19:48.604
Muerte.

1041
01:19:49.473 --> 01:19:51.164
Death.

1042
01:20:57.341 --> 01:20:59.171
Hey. Hey.

1043
01:20:59.643 --> 01:21:00.876
Hey.

1044
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.700
Shh.

1045
01:21:03.446 --> 01:21:05.344
Can you walk?

1046
01:21:06.416 --> 01:21:08.350
Save yourself.

1047
01:21:08.418 --> 01:21:10.652
Not on your life.
Come on.

1048
01:21:22.065 --> 01:21:23.399
Come on.

1049
01:21:24.367 --> 01:21:25.735
Come on.

1050
01:21:57.768 --> 01:22:00.230
Hey. Oh. Mm.

1051
01:22:00.504 --> 01:22:02.695
What are you doing here?

1052
01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.631
I was scared to death.

1053
01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:08.978
Where's Emily?

1054
01:22:09.346 --> 01:22:11.746
Um, she's resting.
She'll see you tomorrow.

1055
01:22:11.815 --> 01:22:13.806
You guys have
a good Christmas?

1056
01:22:13.884 --> 01:22:16.548
We didn't have one.
How could we?

1057
01:22:18.655 --> 01:22:22.219
You know what? We're gonna have
a fantastic one next year.

1058
01:22:22.893 --> 01:22:24.584
I promise.

1059
01:22:29.633 --> 01:22:31.865
We won't have a next year.

1060
01:23:24.889 --> 01:23:27.352
The events of that day

1061
01:23:27.376 --> 01:23:30.676
play in my mind
over and over and over again.

1062
01:23:30.727 --> 01:23:32.290
I'm so sorry.

1063
01:23:32.362 --> 01:23:35.595
If your father hadn't died
while working for me-

1064
01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:37.700
Please give me
a chance to explain.

1065
01:23:37.768 --> 01:23:41.867
Ever since that day, my life
has been filled with grief.

1066
01:23:43.874 --> 01:23:46.940
It is apparent that you
will never forgive me.

1067
01:23:48.545 --> 01:23:50.839
I do not blame you for this.

1068
01:23:51.214 --> 01:23:54.248
It's also something
that I cannot do for myself.

1069
01:23:55.419 --> 01:23:57.617
I loved your father so much.

1070
01:23:58.288 --> 01:24:02.587
A parent should never have
a child precede them in death.

1071
01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.887
It is the most painful
experience imaginable.

1072
01:24:07.664 --> 01:24:09.155
Uh...

1073
01:24:11.301 --> 01:24:13.967
that's enough for today, gentlemen.

1074
01:24:30.721 --> 01:24:32.780
Welcome back, stranger.

1075
01:24:32.956 --> 01:24:34.252
Hey.

1076
01:24:46.136 --> 01:24:47.670
Ta-da.

1077
01:24:48.238 --> 01:24:49.529
Here.

1078
01:24:56.947 --> 01:24:58.372
Wow.

1079
01:24:59.049 --> 01:25:01.244
An "airport gift shop" gift.

1080
01:25:01.318 --> 01:25:03.177
How thoughtful.

1081
01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:07.589
Does it come with needles?

1082
01:25:10.227 --> 01:25:11.618
Uh-

1083
01:25:15.632 --> 01:25:18.729
Yeah, you can kiss me,
even though you're a guy.

1084
01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.431
I missed you too.

1085
01:25:26.977 --> 01:25:29.539
Whatever.
Let's cut to the chase.

1086
01:25:30.714 --> 01:25:33.046
You really blew it
with us this Christmas.

1087
01:25:33.116 --> 01:25:35.683
I was unavoidably detained.

1088
01:25:36.053 --> 01:25:37.787
Okay, yeah.

1089
01:25:38.055 --> 01:25:40.146
I want Christmas.

1090
01:25:43.293 --> 01:25:45.684
I want to ride a horse.

1091
01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:50.623
Oh, I got, like, a week or two
left with this other thing...

1092
01:25:51.201 --> 01:25:53.726
but, um, let me make a call
and we'll see-

1093
01:25:53.804 --> 01:25:55.095
Jason.

1094
01:25:57.374 --> 01:25:58.865
Now.

1095
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:02.510
Okay.

1096
01:26:02.512 --> 01:26:06.380
- That works for me.
- Excuse me, sir. It's Jason on line two.

1097
01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:09.014
Oh, uh, will you all excuse me?

1098
01:26:09.085 --> 01:26:11.379
I have to take this call.

1099
01:26:14.557 --> 01:26:16.621
Go ahead, Jason.

1100
01:26:16.693 --> 01:26:19.218
<i>Mr. Hamilton, look.
One way or another, this is over.</i>

1101
01:26:19.296 --> 01:26:21.230
<i>Either I was in South America
way too long...</i>

1102
01:26:21.298 --> 01:26:23.789
or I missed the deadline
or whatever...

1103
01:26:23.867 --> 01:26:26.429
but what I'm about to do
is way more important.

1104
01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:29.637
<i>And I know you have no reason
whatsoever to trust me...</i>

1105
01:26:29.806 --> 01:26:32.872
<i>but I need to borrow
my grandfather's jet.</i>

1106
01:26:33.877 --> 01:26:35.912
<i>And I need it now.</i>

1107
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.372
<i>I want to take Alexia and Emily
to Gus's ranch for a late Christmas.</i>

1108
01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:43.476
Jason, do you know what you're doing?
Look, I have no control-

1109
01:26:43.553 --> 01:26:47.717
Uh, what, um, Mr. Hamilton
was saying was that, uh...

1110
01:26:47.791 --> 01:26:52.592
he'll be sending along
Red's next gift on your Conversay.

1111
01:26:52.662 --> 01:26:54.789
You have your bags
packed within the hour...

1112
01:26:54.865 --> 01:26:57.857
and, uh, he will
have the jet fuelled...

1113
01:26:57.934 --> 01:26:59.868
- and ready to go.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

1114
01:26:59.936 --> 01:27:02.871
<i>This means so much to me.
And, Hamilton...</i>

1115
01:27:02.939 --> 01:27:06.770
<i>I promise I'm gonna take back all those
nasty thoughts about you being the Grinch.</i>

1116
01:27:07.511 --> 01:27:09.707
<i>Thanks again. Merry Christmas.</i>

1117
01:27:10.831 --> 01:27:14.031
<i># Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way #</i>

1118
01:27:14.055 --> 01:27:17.855
<i># Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh, hey! #</i>

1119
01:27:17.988 --> 01:27:19.522
Hey, Gus!

1120
01:27:22.859 --> 01:27:24.850
What is this?
Snow in Texas?

1121
01:27:24.928 --> 01:27:27.825
Had it trucked in.
Ho, ho, ho!

1122
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.100
All right, Hector, hit it!

1123
01:27:36.106 --> 01:27:38.631
- Merry Christmas.
- Gus, this is Emily.

1124
01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:41.338
- Hi, Emily. Welcome.
- Alexia.

1125
01:27:41.511 --> 01:27:44.078
- Hi.
- Alexia, how ya doin'?

1126
01:27:44.447 --> 01:27:46.540
- And there he is.
- Hey.

1127
01:27:46.916 --> 01:27:48.780
I'll get your bags.

1128
01:28:04.968 --> 01:28:07.328
I see why you chose this place.

1129
01:28:08.104 --> 01:28:10.129
I wish I could take the credit.

1130
01:28:10.207 --> 01:28:13.638
Emily said her wish was to go
horseback riding with you.

1131
01:28:14.678 --> 01:28:16.112
What?

1132
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.210
Emily-

1133
01:28:18.982 --> 01:28:20.973
What? What's wrong?

1134
01:28:23.653 --> 01:28:25.344
She's...

1135
01:28:26.656 --> 01:28:28.954
she's terrified of horses.

1136
01:28:30.961 --> 01:28:33.552
I'm the one who loves horses.

1137
01:28:36.533 --> 01:28:38.624
Oh, Jason, it's so beautiful.

1138
01:28:38.702 --> 01:28:40.693
Thank you.
Thank you.

1139
01:29:03.293 --> 01:29:05.659
Well, this is what I was tellin' you about.

1140
01:29:05.729 --> 01:29:07.491
Pretty, huh?

1141
01:29:07.515 --> 01:29:09.315
It's beautiful.

1142
01:29:10.367 --> 01:29:12.995
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.

1143
01:29:13.069 --> 01:29:15.360
Gonna be okay, sweetie?

1144
01:29:32.055 --> 01:29:33.489
Alexia...

1145
01:29:34.057 --> 01:29:36.520
there's something I need to do.

1146
01:29:36.544 --> 01:29:37.593
What?

1147
01:29:37.594 --> 01:29:39.228
For Emily.

1148
01:29:46.002 --> 01:29:48.036
And now for me.

1149
01:29:51.641 --> 01:29:53.375
And Gus.

1150
01:29:58.782 --> 01:30:00.616
How about that?

1151
01:30:20.203 --> 01:30:23.001
<i>When I achieved my dreams,
it was like going home...</i>

1152
01:30:23.073 --> 01:30:25.405
<i>to a place I'd never been before.</i>

1153
01:30:25.475 --> 01:30:27.709
<i>You don't know that feeling,
do you?</i>

1154
01:30:28.778 --> 01:30:31.344
<i>The first few gifts I've
given you have been practical.</i>

1155
01:30:31.414 --> 01:30:34.107
<i>Show up, do this, do that.</i>

1156
01:30:35.285 --> 01:30:38.978
<i>And then the gifts started
needing you to provide input.</i>

1157
01:30:39.356 --> 01:30:41.483
<i>They needed intuition.</i>

1158
01:30:41.558 --> 01:30:44.755
<i>Still, your average person
is too weighted down.</i>

1159
01:30:44.828 --> 01:30:48.458
<i>Jason, you need to be free,
free to dream.</i>

1160
01:30:49.032 --> 01:30:52.500
<i>You need to come up
with a dream, then act on it.</i>

1161
01:30:52.969 --> 01:30:56.569
<i>Jason, this is the time
for you to dream.</i>

1162
01:31:04.981 --> 01:31:07.479
You thinkin' about butterflies?

1163
01:31:07.851 --> 01:31:10.745
No, Jason, I'm looking at the stars.

1164
01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.616
You know,

1165
01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:15.140
I set this whole thing up...

1166
01:31:15.191 --> 01:31:17.887
because I thought you wanted
to go horseback riding...

1167
01:31:17.961 --> 01:31:19.852
not your mum.

1168
01:31:20.029 --> 01:31:23.121
Get real. Horses are
smelly and sweaty.

1169
01:31:27.404 --> 01:31:29.896
So, sweetie, what's your dream?

1170
01:31:30.473 --> 01:31:33.265
If you could dream
of anything- anything-

1171
01:31:34.477 --> 01:31:36.502
what would your dream be?

1172
01:31:37.714 --> 01:31:39.347
My dream?

1173
01:31:40.617 --> 01:31:43.083
My dream was a perfect day.

1174
01:31:44.821 --> 01:31:47.147
And I'm just finishing it.

1175
01:31:47.924 --> 01:31:49.461
My dream

1176
01:31:49.485 --> 01:31:51.985
was to be with people I love...

1177
01:31:52.429 --> 01:31:55.526
who love each other, that love me.

1178
01:32:11.414 --> 01:32:13.682
What about you, Jason?

1179
01:32:14.884 --> 01:32:16.875
What's your dream?

1180
01:32:20.922 --> 01:32:22.821
I don't know.

1181
01:32:24.394 --> 01:32:28.025
For as long as I can remember,
all I wanted to do was have fun.

1182
01:32:30.433 --> 01:32:32.624
Now I don't have a clue.

1183
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:36.696
It's okay.
Guys are clueless.

1184
01:32:38.975 --> 01:32:41.437
Hey, you have to know this.

1185
01:32:42.946 --> 01:32:45.107
Even if you don't
have a dream of your own...

1186
01:32:45.181 --> 01:32:47.115
you gave me mine.

1187
01:32:47.183 --> 01:32:49.847
- That counts for something.
- Mm.

1188
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.811
Of course.

1189
01:32:58.962 --> 01:33:00.861
Look at her.

1190
01:33:00.885 --> 01:33:03.085
Isn't she beautiful?

1191
01:33:04.334 --> 01:33:07.398
I mean, except for
her choice in lipstick.

1192
01:33:09.172 --> 01:33:10.374
But

1193
01:33:10.398 --> 01:33:12.398
you have to admit...

1194
01:33:13.142 --> 01:33:16.771
even if you got nothing
else out of the deal but her...

1195
01:33:16.846 --> 01:33:19.346
you'd still be a huge winner.

1196
01:33:24.321 --> 01:33:26.115
Don't blow it.

1197
01:33:26.239 --> 01:33:28.739
Knowing you, you're likely to do it.

1198
01:33:35.198 --> 01:33:37.462
Merry Christmas, Jason.

1199
01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.931
Merry Christmas.

1200
01:33:51.881 --> 01:33:54.515
Up until now,
I have only existed.

1201
01:33:55.318 --> 01:33:57.152
I've, um...

1202
01:33:58.421 --> 01:34:00.612
I've drifted through life
day to day...

1203
01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:03.259
thinking that that was enough.

1204
01:34:03.726 --> 01:34:06.786
And honestly, I don't know
if I have my own dream.

1205
01:34:08.865 --> 01:34:11.694
But I do know I can help
others fulfil theirs.

1206
01:34:11.718 --> 01:34:13.418
I know it.

1207
01:34:18.241 --> 01:34:20.939
Jason, will you excuse us
for a few minutes?

1208
01:34:22.445 --> 01:34:24.436


1209
01:34:33.856 --> 01:34:35.717
We've deliberated

1210
01:34:35.741 --> 01:34:37.641
and evaluated

1211
01:34:37.665 --> 01:34:39.865
whether or not your answer

1212
01:34:39.896 --> 01:34:43.999
conforms with the expressed
desires of Red Stevens...

1213
01:34:44.367 --> 01:34:47.126
and we find that your answer does.

1214
01:34:48.404 --> 01:34:52.608
Therefore, we are releasing an
amount allocated for you at this time.

1215
01:34:55.011 --> 01:34:56.880
That is, uh...

1216
01:34:58.047 --> 01:35:00.812
$100 million to do with

1217
01:35:00.836 --> 01:35:03.336
whatever you please.

1218
01:35:05.722 --> 01:35:09.218
All of us here at the firm
want to congratulate you, Jason...

1219
01:35:09.892 --> 01:35:11.826
for sticking it out...

1220
01:35:11.894 --> 01:35:14.988
putting up with some
very harsh conditions...

1221
01:35:15.064 --> 01:35:16.998
and prevailing.

1222
01:35:17.567 --> 01:35:19.558
Congratulations, Jason.

1223
01:35:26.242 --> 01:35:28.176
So that's it?

1224
01:35:28.244 --> 01:35:31.111
Yes, I- I think so.

1225
01:35:31.681 --> 01:35:34.744
No, don't get me wrong.
It's not the amount.

1226
01:35:34.917 --> 01:35:36.608
It's, uh...

1227
01:35:38.988 --> 01:35:40.679
It's just...

1228
01:35:41.057 --> 01:35:43.082
I don't know.
I was...

1229
01:35:43.159 --> 01:35:45.827
expecting a different feeling or...

1230
01:35:47.363 --> 01:35:49.154
something.

1231
01:35:51.134 --> 01:35:53.534
I think that's because now

1232
01:35:53.558 --> 01:35:55.504
you...

1233
01:35:55.505 --> 01:35:57.739
are a different person.

1234
01:35:59.242 --> 01:36:01.904
And, uh-
And, no...

1235
01:36:01.978 --> 01:36:04.269
we won't cash that cheque for you.

1236
01:36:07.617 --> 01:36:10.711
Okay, so he is the best
architect in town. That's great.

1237
01:36:10.787 --> 01:36:13.312
Tell him I want a meeting with him
first thing Monday morning.

1238
01:36:13.389 --> 01:36:15.458
And how much is that?

1239
01:36:16.426 --> 01:36:18.656
I want to tour that property
as soon as possible.

1240
01:36:18.728 --> 01:36:22.960
Oh, that's amazing. We'll have a meeting
at the bank in, let's say, what, a month?

1241
01:36:23.032 --> 01:36:25.466
<i>That would depend on how
many vehicles you were talking.</i>

1242
01:36:25.535 --> 01:36:27.969
- I'm sorry. Can you hold on?
- <i>Certainly.</i>

1243
01:36:28.037 --> 01:36:31.102
- Yeah?
- <i>Mr. Stevens, a young lady to see you.</i>

1244
01:36:31.374 --> 01:36:33.308
- Great. Send her up.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1245
01:36:33.376 --> 01:36:35.571
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Will it be a large number of...</i>

1246
01:36:35.645 --> 01:36:37.579
Yeah, there are gonna be
plenty of cars.

1247
01:36:37.647 --> 01:36:39.975
<i>Okay, we'll have to
look into it and let you know.</i>

1248
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:42.341
- Okay, thank you.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

1249
01:36:54.797 --> 01:36:56.226
Oh,

1250
01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:58.450
I like the remodel.

1251
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:02.561
Where have you been?

1252
01:37:02.839 --> 01:37:04.730
In and out of prison.

1253
01:37:05.108 --> 01:37:06.141
Mm.

1254
01:37:06.165 --> 01:37:08.165
Good to hear.

1255
01:37:09.011 --> 01:37:11.105
No visible tattoos.

1256
01:37:11.681 --> 01:37:13.774
- I missed you.
- Hm.

1257
01:37:15.718 --> 01:37:18.211
- What's this?
- Oh, it's nothing.

1258
01:37:18.888 --> 01:37:20.822
That's a nice round number.

1259
01:37:20.890 --> 01:37:24.417
Somehow I don't think you'll be having
any more credit card problems, will you?

1260
01:37:24.494 --> 01:37:27.554
You know, um,
you still owe me a dinner.

1261
01:37:27.630 --> 01:37:30.064
How could I ever forget?

1262
01:37:30.633 --> 01:37:32.624
I missed you.

1263
01:37:36.506 --> 01:37:38.697
I think I still
remember my way around.

1264
01:37:38.775 --> 01:37:41.200
Why don't you meet me
in a few minutes?

1265
01:37:49.819 --> 01:37:51.653
How quaint.

1266
01:37:51.821 --> 01:37:53.312
Hm.

1267
01:37:57.794 --> 01:38:00.155
Jason? Where'd you go?

1268
01:38:21.617 --> 01:38:24.618
Shall I keep the limo running,
Mr. Stevens?

1269
01:38:24.787 --> 01:38:26.379
Maybe not.

1270
01:38:29.759 --> 01:38:32.958
Ah, Mr. Hamilton, Miss Hastings,
I'm so happy you came.

1271
01:38:33.129 --> 01:38:34.756
Jason,

1272
01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:36.731
what's going on?

1273
01:38:36.732 --> 01:38:38.923
Have a seat.
Please. I insist.

1274
01:38:44.273 --> 01:38:47.766
Thank you all for joining me today.
May I direct your attention to-

1275
01:38:51.714 --> 01:38:53.648
It's called Emily's Home.

1276
01:38:53.716 --> 01:38:57.447
It's for a dozen or more families
experiencing extraordinary
health challenges.

1277
01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.150
Now, over here will be the homes.

1278
01:39:02.225 --> 01:39:04.625
They're part of the same complex,
yet individual dwellings.

1279
01:39:04.694 --> 01:39:08.562
Families are gonna be able to live together
while they face their problems.

1280
01:39:08.631 --> 01:39:10.929
Now, obviously, there's
gonna be plenty of parking.

1281
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.392
Over here is gonna be a
state-of-the-art employment centre...

1282
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:17.471
catering to parents, single or married,
who need to earn some sort of income...

1283
01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.599
while their child undergoes treatment.

1284
01:39:19.675 --> 01:39:22.477
Now, at this
state-of-the-art hospital-

1285
01:39:23.646 --> 01:39:26.275
Excuse me.
What's missing?

1286
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:28.543
Oh, yeah.

1287
01:39:28.567 --> 01:39:29.717
A church...

1288
01:39:29.718 --> 01:39:31.848
a worship centre.

1289
01:39:32.321 --> 01:39:34.255
How much is this
gonna cost?

1290
01:39:34.323 --> 01:39:37.158
If you look at the prospectus
in front of you, page 5.

1291
01:39:37.326 --> 01:39:40.489
The total initial outlay
will be $350 million.

1292
01:39:40.563 --> 01:39:45.432
Your part will be to underwrite the
financing and a loan guarantee
of 250 million.

1293
01:39:45.501 --> 01:39:48.129
I'm gonna be putting up the first
100 million of my own money.

1294
01:39:48.204 --> 01:39:50.205
Mr. Stevens,
this is all well and fine.

1295
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:53.029
We did business with your
grandfather for many years.

1296
01:39:53.075 --> 01:39:57.278
Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting,
but I didn't phrase this as a question.

1297
01:39:57.546 --> 01:39:59.246
You are gonna do this.

1298
01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:02.870
You made this much off my
grandfather in a typical year.

1299
01:40:03.018 --> 01:40:04.678
And, gentlemen,

1300
01:40:04.702 --> 01:40:06.402
this project has

1301
01:40:06.455 --> 01:40:09.822
- the full resources of the Hamilton
law firm backing it.  - Yes? Oh, I-

1302
01:40:09.892 --> 01:40:11.729
Pro bono,

1303
01:40:11.853 --> 01:40:14.653
as I'm sure you will be too.

1304
01:40:15.598 --> 01:40:18.396
Wrap up the details for me,
will you, Hamilton?

1305
01:40:18.467 --> 01:40:21.467
- My pleasure.
- Thank you all. I appreciate it.

1306
01:40:24.907 --> 01:40:26.539
Hey! Whoa!

1307
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:29.335
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1308
01:41:18.694 --> 01:41:20.985
She wanted me to be there.

1309
01:41:22.832 --> 01:41:25.025
It was so important to her.

1310
01:41:27.837 --> 01:41:30.169
She wanted me to be there.

1311
01:42:37.306 --> 01:42:39.340
Jason, Alexia,

1312
01:42:39.364 --> 01:42:41.564
as mayor of Charlotte...

1313
01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:45.002
it is my extreme honour
and privilege to preside over

1314
01:42:45.281 --> 01:42:48.308
the ground breaking
for Emily's Home.

1315
01:42:48.884 --> 01:42:51.415
But it is also a sad day...

1316
01:42:52.688 --> 01:42:55.583
in that the namesake
and the inspiration

1317
01:42:55.607 --> 01:42:58.007
for this incredible project

1318
01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:00.685
is not here with us today.

1319
01:43:01.864 --> 01:43:05.131
But her spirit
will always be with us all.

1320
01:43:10.039 --> 01:43:11.930
Jason, Alexia.

1321
01:43:22.585 --> 01:43:24.519
Thank you very much.

1322
01:43:24.587 --> 01:43:26.082
Thanks.

1323
01:43:35.498 --> 01:43:39.161
I am so proud of the man
you've become.

1324
01:43:39.235 --> 01:43:41.531
Thanks in great part to you.

1325
01:43:42.004 --> 01:43:44.973
Meet me at my office as soon
as possible, will you?

1326
01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:48.539
- I have one more matter I need
to discuss.  - Of course.

1327
01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.972
We understand you went outside
the boundaries of our instructions...

1328
01:43:55.050 --> 01:43:57.080
with one of those gifts.

1329
01:43:57.853 --> 01:43:59.287
What?

1330
01:43:59.855 --> 01:44:02.415
Don't "what" me.
You know what I'm talking about.

1331
01:44:13.302 --> 01:44:16.339
Miss Hastings, will you, uh,
dismiss everyone, please?

1332
01:44:16.363 --> 01:44:17.963
Oh. Yes, sir.

1333
01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:38.358
<i>Over the course of several days...</i>

1334
01:44:38.527 --> 01:44:41.127
<i>this investigator personally witnessed
and recorded the subject...</i>

1335
01:44:41.197 --> 01:44:44.266
<i>as he committed various
misdemeanour infractions</i>

1336
01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:46.690
<i>for which he was never cited.</i>

1337
01:44:48.904 --> 01:44:51.765
<i>Nevertheless, illegal
activities did occur.</i>

1338
01:44:53.542 --> 01:44:56.807
<i>Panhandling,
bordering on assault...</i>

1339
01:44:59.915 --> 01:45:01.949
<i>stealing private property,</i>

1340
01:45:01.973 --> 01:45:04.373
<i>resale of stolen items...</i>

1341
01:45:08.257 --> 01:45:11.088
<i>street vending without a permit...</i>

1342
01:45:12.361 --> 01:45:13.995
<i>jaywalking.</i>

1343
01:45:14.063 --> 01:45:18.491
<i>It is the opinion of this investigator
that the subject is a reprobate...</i>

1344
01:45:18.667 --> 01:45:22.467
<i>and not capable of completing the
12 gifts laid out in Red Stevens's will.</i>

1345
01:45:22.538 --> 01:45:24.301
That's enough, Miss Hastings.

1346
01:45:24.373 --> 01:45:26.568
My pleasure, Mr. Hamilton.

1347
01:45:27.576 --> 01:45:30.279
Jason, if you made it this far,

1348
01:45:30.303 --> 01:45:32.703
he had one final message.

1349
01:45:50.232 --> 01:45:51.664
Jason.

1350
01:45:51.688 --> 01:45:53.088
Yeah?

1351
01:45:54.370 --> 01:45:57.432
You gave away the 100 million?
All of it?

1352
01:45:59.108 --> 01:46:02.134
- Yeah, so what?
- Well, if you're standing here now

1353
01:46:02.211 --> 01:46:03.942
it means that

1354
01:46:03.966 --> 01:46:07.366
not only have you succeeded
in receiving all of my gifts

1355
01:46:07.416 --> 01:46:11.074
but have done so beyond
the boundaries that I have set.

1356
01:46:12.688 --> 01:46:16.315
I guess that means
that I have succeeded as well.

1357
01:46:18.427 --> 01:46:21.055
What I could not
accomplish in life,

1358
01:46:21.130 --> 01:46:23.394
I have done in death.

1359
01:46:24.833 --> 01:46:27.300
As long as you are still alive,

1360
01:46:27.324 --> 01:46:29.324
I will be too.

1361
01:46:32.875 --> 01:46:34.866
I love you, Son.

1362
01:46:34.943 --> 01:46:36.974
I love you too.

1363
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:42.008
Good-bye, Jason.

1364
01:47:31.467 --> 01:47:34.495
"As executor of the estate
of Red Stevens

1365
01:47:34.670 --> 01:47:37.230
"I hereby execute
and otherwise assign

1366
01:47:37.306 --> 01:47:41.370
"complete and controlling
interest to Jason Stevens...

1367
01:47:42.044 --> 01:47:44.642

01:47:45.681 --> 01:47:48.912
"including all holdings,

two billion dollars."

1372
01:47:59.595 --> 01:48:04.294
Depending on OPEC prices and foreign
currency fluctuations, of course.

1373
01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:20.374
<i>I need a lawyer for a
few business ideas I have...</i>

1374
01:48:20.449 --> 01:48:22.383
<i>a few still
in the dream stage.</i>

1375
01:48:22.451 --> 01:48:24.385
<i>When would you like to meet?</i>

1376
01:48:24.453 --> 01:48:26.683
<i>Meet? Hell, you're hired.</i>

1377
01:48:26.755 --> 01:48:29.890
<i>Sir, are you sure you
wouldn't like to meet first?</i>

1378
01:48:29.958 --> 01:48:33.050
<i>You were at the top
of your law class, were you not?</i>

1379
01:48:33.328 --> 01:48:35.592
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Then you're my lawyer.</i>

1380
01:48:35.664 --> 01:48:39.131
<i>Now let's get on with it.
We got a world to conquer.</i>

1381
01:48:50.446 --> 01:48:53.004
Do you think I'm old,
Miss Hastings?

1382
01:48:53.982 --> 01:48:55.641
Mm-mm.

1383
01:48:56.118 --> 01:49:00.549
Well, I think it's about time
I retire from this law firm.

1384
01:49:04.092 --> 01:49:07.191
Whatever will you do,
Mr. Hamilton?

1385
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:12.192
Go to work with Jason Stevens.

1386
01:49:14.403 --> 01:49:16.428
- Change the world.
- Mm.

1387
01:49:21.577 --> 01:49:23.068
Hi.

1388
01:49:24.645 --> 01:49:26.079
Hi.

1389
01:49:42.064 --> 01:49:43.655
Thank you.

1390
01:50:18.734 --> 01:50:21.532
So I want
to give you a gift-

1391
01:50:21.603 --> 01:50:24.431
a series of gifts leading up to,

1392
01:50:24.555 --> 01:50:26.155
well...

1393
01:50:26.708 --> 01:50:29.506
I wanna call it
"the ultimate gift."

1394
01:50:29.578 --> 01:50:32.770
Now, you fail in any way,
it's over. You get nothing.

1395
01:50:39.121 --> 01:50:42.152
You know, you do any work
like you just did...

1396
01:50:42.924 --> 01:50:45.158
you can do anything.

1397
01:50:56.405 --> 01:50:59.169
Now, aren't you
forgettin' something?

1398
01:50:59.241 --> 01:51:02.506
- I don't think so. Shoot.
- The gift.

1399
01:51:02.578 --> 01:51:04.375
The gift of work.

1400
01:51:04.446 --> 01:51:06.906
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

1401
01:51:13.021 --> 01:51:16.354
The charge card company
declined the charge.

1402
01:51:16.425 --> 01:51:19.919
That's impossible. I don't have a
credit limit. Just run it through again.

1403
01:51:20.195 --> 01:51:24.599
It's always our practice to run it
through again, but they declined.

1404
01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:33.735
I need a friend.

1405
01:51:33.909 --> 01:51:36.910
You expect this friendship to continue?

1406
01:51:37.279 --> 01:51:40.915
I plan on knowing Jason
for the rest of my life.

1407
01:51:47.556 --> 01:51:51.214
Do- Do you truly
know how to learn?

1408
01:51:52.094 --> 01:51:54.922
Villagers wait for books.

1409
01:51:55.297 --> 01:51:57.231
You bring them new books.

1410
01:51:57.299 --> 01:52:00.061
They are waiting for you to

1411
01:52:00.085 --> 01:52:01.936
pick up old books.

1412
01:52:01.937 --> 01:52:04.138
Exchange. Library.

1413
01:52:04.162 --> 01:52:05.562
Si?

1414
01:52:17.686 --> 01:52:21.219
{\an1}Well, you don't begin to live
until you've lost everything.

1415
01:52:21.289 --> 01:52:22.747
{\an1}Wait!

1416
01:52:22.771 --> 01:52:24.225
{\an1}Wait!

1417
01:52:24.626 --> 01:52:27.355
{\an1}That's an $8,000 paint job!

1418
01:52:28.330 --> 01:52:30.525
{\an1}Heck, I've lost everything
three or four times.

1419
01:52:30.599 --> 01:52:32.863
{\an1}It's the perfect
place to start.

1420
01:52:40.676 --> 01:52:42.545
{\an1}And Emily-

1421
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:44.669
{\an1}she's-

1422
01:52:47.516 --> 01:52:50.314
{\an1}she's the best decision
I ever made.

1423
01:52:51.386 --> 01:52:54.446
{\an1}What's gonna
happen to my mum?

1424
01:52:54.523 --> 01:52:56.616
{\an1}I really don't hate her,
you know.

1425
01:53:08.970 --> 01:53:11.461
{\an1}- Salud.
- Salud.

1426
01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:13.105
{\an1}Salud!

1427
01:53:13.475 --> 01:53:14.709
{\an1}Salud.

1428
01:53:25.787 --> 01:53:28.647
{\an1}Jason, you need to be free,

1429
01:53:28.671 --> 01:53:30.671
{\an1}free to dream.

1430
01:53:30.826 --> 01:53:33.818
{\an1}You need to come up
with a dream, then act on it.

1431
01:53:33.895 --> 01:53:37.092
{\an1}And honestly, I don't know
if I have my own dream.

1432
01:53:39.101 --> 01:53:41.965
{\an1}But I do know
I can help others fulfil theirs.

1433
01:53:47.542 --> 01:53:50.272
{\an1}Uh, I do have to
give away some money.

1434
01:53:50.345 --> 01:53:53.136
{\an1}You're getting less
mysterious by the minute.

1435
01:53:55.016 --> 01:53:57.177
{\an1}She owes $1,600
in back rent.

1436
01:53:57.252 --> 01:53:58.945
{\an1}Pay it.

1437
01:53:59.421 --> 01:54:01.548
{\an1}You're a hundred
dollars short.

1438
01:54:01.623 --> 01:54:04.922
{\an1}Tell Hamilton I'm good for it.
Just pay that bill.

1439
01:54:11.299 --> 01:54:13.859
{\an1}So, apparently...

1440
01:54:14.936 --> 01:54:17.871
{\an1}someone came by
and covered my back rent.

1441
01:54:19.374 --> 01:54:21.165
{\an1}Was it you?

1442
01:54:22.878 --> 01:54:24.675
{\an1}Thank you.

1443
01:54:32.821 --> 01:54:34.812
{\an1}What would
your dream be?

1444
01:54:36.224 --> 01:54:38.022
{\an1}My dream?

1445
01:54:39.094 --> 01:54:41.562
{\an1}My dream was
a perfect day.

1446
01:54:47.869 --> 01:54:50.235
{\an1}And I'm just finishing it.

1447
01:54:59.014 --> 01:55:02.177
{\an1}- I love you, Son.
- I love you too.

1448
01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:07.584
{\an1}Good-bye, Jason.
