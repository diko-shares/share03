00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:52.515
<i>In the last century,</i>

2
00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:56.019
<i>before the birth</i>
<i>of the new faith called Christianity,</i>

3
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.813
<i>which was destined to overthrow</i>
<i>the pagan tyranny of Rome</i>

4
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:01.190
<i>and bring about a new society,</i>

5
00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:05.403
<i>the Roman Republic stood</i>
<i>at the very center of the civilized world.</i>

6
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:08.948
<i>"Of all things fairest," sang the poet,</i>

7
00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:13.494
<i>"first among cities and home of the gods</i>
<i>is golden Rome."</i>

8
00:08:13.578 --> 00:08:16.247
<i>Yet, even at the zenith</i>
<i>of her pride and power</i>

9
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:19.417
<i>the Republic lay fatally stricken</i>
<i>with a disease</i>

10
00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:21.419
<i>called human slavery.</i>

11
00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:24.589
<i>The age of the dictator was at hand</i>

12
00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:28.134
<i>waiting in the shadows</i>
<i>for the event to bring it forth.</i>

13
00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:30.928
<i>In that same century,</i>

14
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.723
<i>in the conquered Greek province of Thrace,</i>

15
00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:37.185
<i>an illiterate slave woman</i>
<i>added to her master's wealth</i>

16
00:08:37.268 --> 00:08:41.564
<i>by giving birth to a son</i>
<i>whom she named Spartacus.</i>

17
00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:44.025
<i>A proud, rebellious son</i>

18
00:08:44.108 --> 00:08:47.278
<i>who was sold to living death</i>
<i>in the mines of Libya</i>

19
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.655
<i>before his thirteenth birthday.</i>

20
00:08:50.323 --> 00:08:53.910
<i>There, under whip and chain and sun,</i>

21
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:56.954
<i>he lived out his youth</i>
<i>and his young manhood,</i>

22
00:08:57.038 --> 00:08:59.290
<i>dreaming the death of slavery</i>

23
00:08:59.332 --> 00:09:02.710
<i>2,000 years before it finally would die.</i>

24
00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.088
Back to work!

25
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:49.507
Back to work!

26
00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:57.849
Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

27
00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.726
Come on, get up! Get up! Get...

28
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.021
Oh, my ankle! My ankle!

29
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:07.191
My ankle!

30
00:10:10.528 --> 00:10:12.321
Guard! Guard!

31
00:10:16.117 --> 00:10:19.245
Spartacus again, huh?
Well, this time he dies.

32
00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:22.498
Move along! Back to work, all of you!

33
00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:45.646
- Welcome, Lentulus Batiatus.
- Welcome, indeed, my dear Captain.

34
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:54.363
Oh, 11 miles through this disastrous heat

35
00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:57.283
and the cost of hiring an escort, ruinous.

36
00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:02.580
Even so, I warrant you have nothing
fit to sell me, have you, Captain?

37
00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.082
I've wasted both my time and my money.

38
00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:08.920
- Tell me the truth.
- We have a few you might be interested in.

39
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:11.631
These? Carrion.

40
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:13.716
The buzzards are late.

41
00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:16.302
This one's not bad. He's a Gaul.

42
00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.930
Oh, I don't like Gauls. Hairy.

43
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.808
Can he come down unassisted?

44
00:11:22.892 --> 00:11:24.352
Come down, you.

45
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:26.646
Come down!

46
00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:35.446
- Be good enough to show me the teeth.
- Open your mouth.

47
00:11:35.488 --> 00:11:36.864
Thank you.

48
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:42.286
Yes, as the teeth go, so go the bones.

49
00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:46.332
This mouth is really impermissible.

50
00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:49.961
- The fellow's made of chalk.
- We have many others.

51
00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:59.136
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

52
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.308
- Who's that?
- Oh, this one's a Thracian.

53
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.936
- I'm making an example of him.
- How?

54
00:12:06.978 --> 00:12:09.313
- Starve him to death.
- Oh.

55
00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:11.315
It's the only thing that impresses slaves.

56
00:12:11.357 --> 00:12:12.984
Oh, what a pity.

57
00:12:16.153 --> 00:12:18.406
He reacts. Good muscle tone.

58
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.742
Can I see his teeth?

59
00:12:21.826 --> 00:12:23.953
Open your mouth, Spartacus.

60
00:12:24.787 --> 00:12:27.623
You smell like a rhinoceros.

61
00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:32.461
Captain, the teeth.
You asked him to open his mouth.

62
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:36.132
- He doesn't obey you?
- His teeth are the best thing about him.

63
00:12:36.173 --> 00:12:38.593
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

64
00:12:38.676 --> 00:12:42.555
Marvelous. I wish I'd been here. I'll take him.

65
00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:44.599
Let's look at some of the others.

66
00:12:51.564 --> 00:12:52.982
Come along.

67
00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:59.548
In spite of sickness and death,
we will profit 11,000 sesterces.

68
00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:02.051
Including your commission, of course.

69
00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:05.137
Oh, no, sir. Without my commission.

70
00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:10.476
Marcellus, there they are.

71
00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:13.020
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

72
00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:16.023
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

73
00:14:21.112 --> 00:14:22.697
Slaves,

74
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.909
you have arrived at the gladiatorial school
of Lentulus Batiatus.

75
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:30.830
You'll be trained by experts
to fight in pairs to the death.

76
00:14:30.913 --> 00:14:34.125
You won't fight to the death here.

77
00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:36.127
That will be after you've been sold

78
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.170
and then for
ladies and gentlemen of quality,

79
00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:40.881
for those who appreciate a fine kill.

80
00:14:42.258 --> 00:14:45.511
A gladiator's like a stallion,
he must be pampered.

81
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:47.888
You'll be oiled, bathed,

82
00:14:47.972 --> 00:14:52.101
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

83
00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:57.189
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself.

84
00:14:57.273 --> 00:14:59.358
You'll be given your ceremonial caudas.

85
00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:01.527
Marcellus, please. There.

86
00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:04.488
Be proud of them.

87
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.492
On special occasions, those who please me

88
00:15:08.576 --> 00:15:12.121
will even be given the companionship
of a young lady.

89
00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:16.000
Approximately half our graduates

90
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:19.503
live for five, 10, 10 years.

91
00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:23.966
Some even attain freedom
and become trainers themselves.

92
00:15:24.008 --> 00:15:25.593
Marcellus.

93
00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:27.845
I congratulate you.

94
00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:30.890
And may fortune smile on most of you.

95
00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.939
Marcellus, watch the second from the right.

96
00:15:39.023 --> 00:15:42.109
He's a Thracian. They were going to kill him
for hamstringing a guard.

97
00:15:42.193 --> 00:15:45.780
- We'll break him of that.
- Don't overdo it. He has quality.

98
00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:53.704
Next.

99
00:16:00.753 --> 00:16:01.879
Next.

100
00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:10.888
I like you.

101
00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:14.642
I want you to be my friend.

102
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.062
I want to be your friend.

103
00:16:18.896 --> 00:16:21.899
All I ask is that you get along with me.

104
00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:26.445
What's your name, slave?

105
00:16:27.446 --> 00:16:28.781
Spartacus.

106
00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:32.660
I feel you don't like me.

107
00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:40.876
Give him your sword.

108
00:16:44.463 --> 00:16:45.714
Take it!

109
00:16:53.264 --> 00:16:55.891
I have a feeling you want to kill me.

110
00:16:57.518 --> 00:17:00.229
This is the only chance you'll ever get.

111
00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:01.897
Kill me.

112
00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:05.276
Don't be afraid, slave.

113
00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:07.778
You have that sword.

114
00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:10.614
I only have this piece of wood.

115
00:17:13.492 --> 00:17:15.619
Are you going to disobey me?

116
00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:21.917
Take his sword.

117
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:26.046
You're not as stupid as I thought.

118
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.340
You might even be intelligent.

119
00:17:28.507 --> 00:17:30.634
That's dangerous for slaves.

120
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.515
You just remember, from now on
everything you do I'll be watching.

121
00:18:08.464 --> 00:18:10.424
You did the right thing.

122
00:18:11.008 --> 00:18:15.095
Every once in a while
Marcellus likes to kill a man as an example.

123
00:18:15.471 --> 00:18:19.016
I think he's picked you. Better watch him.

124
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:25.856
- How long have you been here?
- Six months.

125
00:18:25.898 --> 00:18:27.733
I wish he'd pick me.

126
00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.111
I want one chance at that pig
before they carry me out!

127
00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:33.364
Quiet! No talking down there.

128
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.702
Dionysius, you'll get us in trouble
just like in the mines.

129
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.043
What's your name?

130
00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:49.380
You don't want to know my name.

131
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.924
I don't want to know your name.

132
00:18:52.925 --> 00:18:54.927
Just a friendly question.

133
00:18:55.052 --> 00:18:57.304
Gladiators don't make friends.

134
00:18:57.513 --> 00:19:00.391
If we're ever matched in the arena together,

135
00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:02.351
I'll have to kill you.

136
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.297
Helena

137
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.926
with Galino.

138
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:41.724
Patricia,

139
00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:45.185
Crixus.

140
00:19:48.147 --> 00:19:49.481
Priscilla,

141
00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:53.444
David.

142
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.241
Claudia,

143
00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:01.785
Pharox.

144
00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:08.125
Varinia,

145
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:12.337
- Dionysius.
- No, no. Spartacus.

146
00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:16.842
Spartacus.

147
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:22.181
Felicia...

148
00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.919
I've never had a woman.

149
00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:02.698
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.

150
00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.992
- Go away.
- What will she think of you?

151
00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:08.245
- Indeed, what will I think of you?
- Go away.

152
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:13.208
Mmm. Come, come. Be generous.
We must learn to share our pleasures.

153
00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:17.796
I'm not an animal!

154
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.175
You're not trying to escape,
by any chance?

155
00:22:21.258 --> 00:22:24.136
Direct your courage to the girl, Spartacus.

156
00:22:26.972 --> 00:22:28.765
I'm not an animal!

157
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:38.066
- I'm not an animal.
- Neither am I.

158
00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:16.813
What's your name?

159
00:23:19.483 --> 00:23:20.692
Varinia.

160
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.864
You'll have to take her out of here,
Marcellus.

161
00:23:25.948 --> 00:23:27.574
You may not be an animal, Spartacus,

162
00:23:27.658 --> 00:23:31.995
but this sorry show gives me little hope
that you'll ever be a man.

163
00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:22.272
First rule,
you get an instant kill on the red.

164
00:25:22.606 --> 00:25:24.941
Here, here.

165
00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:30.947
Always remember, go for the red first.
If you don't, your opponent will.

166
00:25:31.656 --> 00:25:33.992
In the blue, you get a cripple.

167
00:25:34.076 --> 00:25:37.537
Here, here,

168
00:25:37.621 --> 00:25:39.539
here and here.

169
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.708
Second rule,

170
00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:44.711
go for the cripple before the slow kill.

171
00:25:45.212 --> 00:25:47.631
Here's a slow kill on the yellow.

172
00:25:47.964 --> 00:25:51.802
Here, here and here.

173
00:25:52.636 --> 00:25:53.970
Remember,

174
00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:58.183
a slow kill may have enough left in him
to kill you before he dies.

175
00:25:58.683 --> 00:26:00.143
With a cripple, you know you've got him

176
00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:02.187
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

177
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.148
The rest is all right
for a public spectacle in Rome,

178
00:26:05.232 --> 00:26:08.360
but here at Capua
we expect more than simple butchery

179
00:26:08.443 --> 00:26:09.945
and we get it.

180
00:26:11.947 --> 00:26:15.325
Spartacus, why are you looking at that girl?

181
00:26:16.743 --> 00:26:19.746
Varinia! Stand still.

182
00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:27.379
Since all you can do is look at girls,

183
00:26:28.004 --> 00:26:31.383
all right, slave, go ahead and look.

184
00:26:32.968 --> 00:26:34.553
I said, look.

185
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:19.556
No. No, this one goes to the Spaniard.

186
00:27:26.855 --> 00:27:29.399
Have a good night's rest, Spartacus.

187
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:37.282
In there.

188
00:28:21.785 --> 00:28:22.953
Woman!

189
00:28:24.246 --> 00:28:27.040
I've warned you about this kind of thing.

190
00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:33.463
All right, bring them in.

191
00:28:53.525 --> 00:28:56.403
No talking! Move along.

192
00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.885
Did they hurt you?

193
00:30:07.724 --> 00:30:08.767
No.

194
00:30:52.686 --> 00:30:53.895
That's a kill.

195
00:30:53.937 --> 00:30:56.231
One, two,

196
00:30:56.272 --> 00:30:59.693
three, four, five.

197
00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:01.986
One, two,

198
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.072
three, four...

199
00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:02.338
We have visitors, tremendous visitors.

200
00:32:02.422 --> 00:32:05.550
Two simply enormous
Roman lords on the hill.

201
00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:07.594
How easily impressed you are, Ramon.

202
00:32:07.677 --> 00:32:09.888
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

203
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:11.973
Tell them to wait for me when they arrive.

204
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:15.852
- Master, you don't understand...
- How enormous do these Roman lords get?

205
00:32:15.894 --> 00:32:18.772
One of them is Marcus Licinius Crassus.

206
00:32:18.855 --> 00:32:20.523
What? Wait a minute.

207
00:32:20.565 --> 00:32:24.110
Crassus here? My red toga with the acorns.

208
00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:26.613
Chairs in the atrium. Second-best wine.

209
00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:29.991
No, the best, but small goblets.

210
00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:32.202
Gracchus.
You know how Crassus loathes him.

211
00:32:33.787 --> 00:32:37.040
- Take him away.
- I can't lift it.

212
00:32:37.123 --> 00:32:39.709
Use your imagination. Cover him.

213
00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:42.295
Tell Marcellus to get the men ready.

214
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:44.839
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show.

215
00:32:44.881 --> 00:32:46.424
Forgive me, Gracchus.

216
00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:14.202
Marcus Licinius Crassus.

217
00:33:14.244 --> 00:33:16.037
Most noble radiance,

218
00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:18.581
first general of the Republic,

219
00:33:18.665 --> 00:33:22.502
father and defender of Rome,
honor my house.

220
00:33:22.585 --> 00:33:24.587
Bless it with your presence.

221
00:33:33.388 --> 00:33:35.098
Wine, sweetmeats!

222
00:33:35.139 --> 00:33:38.351
Can't you see that Their Honors
are exhausted?

223
00:33:41.813 --> 00:33:43.815
Have the goodness to sit.

224
00:33:49.195 --> 00:33:51.614
Is anything wrong, Your Nobility?

225
00:33:52.448 --> 00:33:53.491
No.

226
00:33:54.784 --> 00:33:58.121
Welcome to the Lady Claudia Maria,

227
00:33:58.162 --> 00:34:01.457
former wife of Lucius Caius Marius

228
00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:05.003
whose recent execution
touched us all deeply.

229
00:34:05.837 --> 00:34:07.171
Honor to the Lady Helena,

230
00:34:07.255 --> 00:34:10.466
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus,

231
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.053
whose fame shall live on forever
in the person of his son,

232
00:34:14.137 --> 00:34:15.638
your brother,

233
00:34:15.722 --> 00:34:18.975
Marcus Publius Glabrus,

234
00:34:19.392 --> 00:34:21.477
hero of the Eastern War.

235
00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:23.271
How very much he knows.

236
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.691
Allow me to bring you up-to-date.

237
00:34:26.774 --> 00:34:30.194
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

238
00:34:30.278 --> 00:34:33.031
A mating of eagles, Your Sanctity.

239
00:34:33.114 --> 00:34:34.782
Fan His Magnitude. He sweats.

240
00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:36.075
- No, no.
- No, no.

241
00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.828
My young friends desire
a private showing of two pairs.

242
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.622
Two pairs?

243
00:34:40.663 --> 00:34:44.167
Oh, yes. I have something
that would please them.

244
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.919
Two pairs to the death.

245
00:34:46.002 --> 00:34:48.504
To the death, Your Ladyship?

246
00:34:48.588 --> 00:34:51.090
Surely you don't think
we came all the way to Capua

247
00:34:51.174 --> 00:34:52.842
for gymnastics?

248
00:34:54.093 --> 00:34:56.220
But I beg, Your Honors,

249
00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:59.974
we train the finest gladiators in all Italy.

250
00:35:00.016 --> 00:35:01.893
We can give you a display
of swordsmanship

251
00:35:01.976 --> 00:35:04.812
which is better than you can see in Rome.

252
00:35:04.854 --> 00:35:08.024
When they're sold, their new masters
may do with them as they wish.

253
00:35:08.107 --> 00:35:11.986
But here, no,
we never fight them to the death.

254
00:35:12.028 --> 00:35:16.366
- Crassus.
- Today is an exception.

255
00:35:16.407 --> 00:35:20.286
But the ill feeling, it would spread
through the whole school.

256
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.539
Then the cost. Oh, the cost.

257
00:35:23.623 --> 00:35:25.249
Name your price.

258
00:35:27.335 --> 00:35:30.088
25,000 sesterces.

259
00:35:31.047 --> 00:35:32.423
Arrange it.

260
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.593
Are you serious, sir?

261
00:35:37.762 --> 00:35:39.681
Arrange it immediately.

262
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:43.142
Of course,
we shall want to choose them ourselves.

263
00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:46.562
You do have a certain variety?

264
00:35:46.646 --> 00:35:47.939
Inexhaustible.

265
00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.075
Spartacus, there's going to be a fight
to the death.

266
00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:01.035
- To the death?
- How do you know?

267
00:36:01.077 --> 00:36:03.454
I heard Marcellus tell one of his guards.

268
00:36:03.538 --> 00:36:05.581
- Who fights?
- I don't know.

269
00:36:08.543 --> 00:36:10.003
To the death.

270
00:36:13.214 --> 00:36:15.550
What if they matched you and me?

271
00:36:16.926 --> 00:36:18.594
They won't.

272
00:36:18.678 --> 00:36:20.304
What if they did?

273
00:36:21.055 --> 00:36:22.640
Would you fight?

274
00:36:25.226 --> 00:36:27.270
I'd have to. So would you.

275
00:36:28.354 --> 00:36:30.356
Would you try to kill me?

276
00:36:32.275 --> 00:36:33.776
Yes, I'd kill.

277
00:36:34.652 --> 00:36:36.571
I'd try to stay...

278
00:36:36.612 --> 00:36:39.615
I'd try to stay alive, and so would you.

279
00:36:39.699 --> 00:36:42.785
All gladiators
up to the training area.

280
00:36:42.827 --> 00:36:45.246
Some visitors want to admire you.

281
00:36:49.709 --> 00:36:52.170
Form a line in front of me.

282
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:56.257
Would Your Excellencies
care to make your selection now?

283
00:36:58.259 --> 00:36:59.469
Claudia.

284
00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:11.189
Oh, they're magnificent.

285
00:37:11.272 --> 00:37:13.524
For you, Lady Helena,

286
00:37:13.608 --> 00:37:16.152
may I suggest Praxus?

287
00:37:18.154 --> 00:37:19.822
A veritable tiger.

288
00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:22.533
I don't like him.

289
00:37:28.998 --> 00:37:30.416
I prefer that one.

290
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.376
- Which one?
- No, no.

291
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.587
David?

292
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.173
Oh, Crixus, yes.

293
00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:40.593
Marcellus, Crixus for the short sword.

294
00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:42.386
Ah!

295
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:48.684
Have you ever seen
such a pair of shoulders? Dionysius.

296
00:37:49.519 --> 00:37:53.189
I admit he's small,
but he's very compact and extremely strong.

297
00:37:53.272 --> 00:37:55.149
In fact, he looks...

298
00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:58.903
He looks smaller here
than he does in the arena.

299
00:38:00.988 --> 00:38:02.198
Optical.

300
00:38:03.866 --> 00:38:05.493
Give me that one.

301
00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:09.372
Oh, Galino. Yes, yes. Galino.

302
00:38:09.413 --> 00:38:13.501
You have a shrewd eye, Your Pulchritude,
if I may permit myself the...

303
00:38:13.543 --> 00:38:15.086
Galino.

304
00:38:15.169 --> 00:38:19.048
Practically every man in this school
is an expert with a Thracian sword

305
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.094
but the trident
is something very rare these days.

306
00:38:23.177 --> 00:38:27.306
May I suggest the Ethiopian?

307
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:32.812
There are very few Ethiopians
in the country.

308
00:38:33.396 --> 00:38:37.150
Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

309
00:38:43.656 --> 00:38:45.158
I'll take him.

310
00:38:46.284 --> 00:38:49.078
Draba? Oh, no. For you I want the best.

311
00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:52.165
- I do think the Ethiopian...
- I want the most beautiful.

312
00:38:52.248 --> 00:38:54.417
I'll take the big black one.

313
00:38:56.419 --> 00:38:57.587
Draba.

314
00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:02.466
Only one man in the entire school
stands a chance

315
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.053
with the Thracian knife against the trident.

316
00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:07.638
There.

317
00:39:08.764 --> 00:39:11.642
- Over there, Lady Helena.
- He's impertinent.

318
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.061
I'll take him.

319
00:39:14.103 --> 00:39:18.274
And he's a coward to boot.
Have him flogged.

320
00:39:19.358 --> 00:39:22.320
Over there, Lady Helena. The beast of Libya.

321
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:25.323
I prefer the coward.

322
00:39:28.868 --> 00:39:30.453
Spartacus.

323
00:39:30.494 --> 00:39:34.540
If both men are down and refuse to fight
your trainer will slit their throats.

324
00:39:34.624 --> 00:39:36.000
We want no tricks.

325
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:38.419
Tricks, madam?
At the school of Batiatus?

326
00:39:38.461 --> 00:39:41.964
You heard the instruction, Marcellus?
Remember it.

327
00:39:42.798 --> 00:39:45.801
I feel sorry for the poor things in this heat.

328
00:39:45.885 --> 00:39:48.471
Don't put them in those suffocating tunics.

329
00:39:48.512 --> 00:39:51.140
Let them wear just enough for modesty.

330
00:39:51.224 --> 00:39:54.435
Whatever they wear, Lady,
they'll bless your name.

331
00:39:55.645 --> 00:39:57.521
Back, the rest of you.

332
00:39:58.064 --> 00:39:59.732
Our choosing has bored you?

333
00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:03.194
No, most exciting. I tingle.

334
00:40:03.653 --> 00:40:05.321
Do let's get out of the sun.

335
00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:09.075
May I conduct
Your Magnificences to the gallery?

336
00:40:19.585 --> 00:40:20.795
Ah-ha!

337
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.714
An eavesdropper. Oh, the gods.

338
00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:28.844
How far from Rome must I go
to avoid that cunning face?

339
00:40:28.928 --> 00:40:32.515
Don't talk about Gracchus. He's so hateful.

340
00:40:32.598 --> 00:40:35.351
For Gracchus, hatred of the patrician class
is a profession

341
00:40:35.434 --> 00:40:37.186
and not such a bad one, either.

342
00:40:37.228 --> 00:40:41.899
How else can one become master of the mob
and first senator of Rome?

343
00:40:41.983 --> 00:40:44.277
Oh, Crassus, it's so boring.

344
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.034
I believe that girl smells of perfume.

345
00:40:52.076 --> 00:40:55.997
Whatever it is,
she smells most delectable.

346
00:40:56.038 --> 00:40:59.500
You can't keep slaves from stealing
unless you chain them.

347
00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:02.670
When a slave's as pretty
as she is, she doesn't have to steal.

348
00:41:02.712 --> 00:41:05.548
An arrangement is made.

349
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:08.009
If her ankles are good,

350
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.928
you can be sure an arrangement was made.

351
00:41:13.055 --> 00:41:16.225
- Oh, master!
- A catastrophe.

352
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:17.977
I've been anointed.

353
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.479
Why, you trollop! You did that on purpose.

354
00:41:20.563 --> 00:41:22.732
It was an accident. Come here, girl.

355
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.822
Don't be frightened.

356
00:41:30.573 --> 00:41:33.576
- What country are you from?
- Britannia.

357
00:41:35.077 --> 00:41:37.413
How long have you been a slave?

358
00:41:39.582 --> 00:41:41.083
Since I was 13.

359
00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:45.463
You have a certain education.

360
00:41:45.546 --> 00:41:48.632
My first master had me tutored
for his children.

361
00:41:54.847 --> 00:41:57.600
I like her. She has spirit.

362
00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:01.687
- I'll buy her.
- Buy her, Your Magnificence?

363
00:42:01.771 --> 00:42:04.106
I have spent quite a lot of money on her.

364
00:42:04.148 --> 00:42:06.442
I've no doubt of it. 2,000 sesterces.

365
00:42:06.484 --> 00:42:08.944
She'll be waiting at your litter.

366
00:42:08.986 --> 00:42:11.989
No, I don't want her feet spoiled by walking.

367
00:42:12.698 --> 00:42:16.118
Send her to Rome with your steward
the next time he has to go there.

368
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.788
He leaves tomorrow, and the girl with him.

369
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:21.374
More wine, and thank your gods.

370
00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:25.252
You provoke me, Crassus.
I shan't be nice to you anymore.

371
00:42:25.294 --> 00:42:26.879
Ah, why distress me so much?

372
00:42:26.962 --> 00:42:30.299
You're horribly rich, yet you're the only one
of my brother's friends

373
00:42:30.383 --> 00:42:33.135
who hasn't given him a wedding present.

374
00:42:35.304 --> 00:42:36.389
Ah!

375
00:42:37.515 --> 00:42:40.434
I was saving it for a more suitable moment.

376
00:42:41.227 --> 00:42:43.813
Here. Give it to him, child.

377
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:45.815
What is it?

378
00:42:45.898 --> 00:42:50.236
As from this moment, your husband is
commander of the garrison of Rome.

379
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.154
Wonderful.

380
00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:53.614
Ah!

381
00:42:55.491 --> 00:42:59.036
I don't know how
I shall ever be able to repay you.

382
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.330
Time will solve that mystery.

383
00:43:03.165 --> 00:43:06.252
- The garrison of Rome.
- Yes.

384
00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:10.005
The only power in Rome strong enough
to checkmate Gracchus and his Senate.

385
00:43:10.047 --> 00:43:11.632
You are clever.

386
00:43:23.727 --> 00:43:25.020
Open up.

387
00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:48.335
Through that door.

388
00:44:03.267 --> 00:44:05.269
You will have to watch him, Claudia.

389
00:44:05.352 --> 00:44:08.272
Father almost disinherited him
because of slave girls.

390
00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:12.026
The marriage contract
absolutely forbids a harem.

391
00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:14.695
What about your litter bearers?

392
00:44:14.737 --> 00:44:19.408
Every one of them is under 20
and taller than they should be.

393
00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.410
She sets rather
a high standard for you.

394
00:44:22.661 --> 00:44:25.164
Your pleasure, Your Highness.

395
00:44:25.456 --> 00:44:26.999
To you, my dear,

396
00:44:27.082 --> 00:44:30.503
shall go the honor of starting
this poetic drama.

397
00:44:34.215 --> 00:44:35.424
Open up.

398
00:44:41.931 --> 00:44:44.517
First pair! Crixus and Galino!

399
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.788
Those who are about to die salute you.

400
00:46:43.802 --> 00:46:45.095
Crixus.

401
00:46:55.397 --> 00:46:56.690
Next pair!

402
00:47:19.254 --> 00:47:21.882
Those who are about to die salute you.

403
00:48:16.645 --> 00:48:18.647
Your Thracian's doing well.

404
00:48:18.689 --> 00:48:22.192
How were you able to get my appointment
without Gracchus knowing?

405
00:48:22.276 --> 00:48:24.153
I fought fire with oil.

406
00:48:24.194 --> 00:48:26.113
I purchased the Senate behind his back.

407
00:48:26.155 --> 00:48:28.991
- I still think the trident's going to win.
- Hmm?

408
00:49:55.994 --> 00:49:59.289
- Why doesn't he kill him?
- Kill him.

409
00:50:00.249 --> 00:50:02.125
What's the matter now?

410
00:50:03.252 --> 00:50:04.503
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

411
00:50:04.586 --> 00:50:05.921
Kill him, you imbecile!

412
00:50:06.004 --> 00:50:07.506
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

413
00:51:55.364 --> 00:51:57.574
He'll hang there till he rots.

414
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.087
Take a last look, Spartacus.

415
00:53:34.379 --> 00:53:36.965
She's going to Rome. She's been sold.

416
00:53:39.676 --> 00:53:41.303
She's been sold?

417
00:53:43.972 --> 00:53:46.349
No talking in the kitchen, slave.

418
00:54:40.237 --> 00:54:41.488
There's trouble in the mess hall.

419
00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:43.865
They killed Marcellus
and maybe the other two.

420
00:54:43.949 --> 00:54:45.367
Call out the guard.

421
00:54:45.408 --> 00:54:47.244
- Move, move.

422
00:54:49.663 --> 00:54:53.041
On second thoughts,
I'll deliver the girl personally.

423
00:54:53.083 --> 00:54:56.253
Ride to Capua. Call out the garrison.
I don't trust this lot.

424
00:54:56.336 --> 00:54:58.755
- I hold you responsible.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.475
Around Capua,
they ravaged the countryside,

426
00:57:57.559 --> 00:57:59.853
forcing other slaves to join them.

427
00:57:59.894 --> 00:58:03.690
Looting, robbing, burning everything,

428
00:58:03.732 --> 00:58:08.528
while they make their camp
in the escarpments of Vesuvius.

429
00:58:09.446 --> 00:58:12.073
Each day swells their numbers.

430
00:58:12.991 --> 00:58:16.328
The situation lies in the hands

431
00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:18.246
of this august body.

432
00:58:21.374 --> 00:58:23.752
Where's the mighty Crassus?

433
00:58:24.753 --> 00:58:26.755
- Out of the city.
- At least, you're here.

434
00:58:26.796 --> 00:58:30.050
No need to fear for Rome
as long as Glabrus is with us.

435
00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:34.929
Let me add,
over 100 estates have been burned.

436
00:58:35.513 --> 00:58:37.766
Among them, gentlemen, my own.

437
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:42.604
Burned to the ground
and 3 million sesterces lost.

438
00:58:43.355 --> 00:58:47.192
I propose the immediate recall
of Pompey and his legions from Spain.

439
00:58:47.275 --> 00:58:49.569
I could raise 500 men
and bring the lot of them in.

440
00:58:49.611 --> 00:58:51.571
Don't make a fool of yourself.

441
00:58:51.613 --> 00:58:55.617
Why call back the legions

442
00:58:55.658 --> 00:58:58.328
when the garrison of Rome
has nothing to do

443
00:58:58.411 --> 00:59:00.955
but to defend us from sausage makers?

444
00:59:02.665 --> 00:59:04.959
Let's send Glabrus
against these scoundrels.

445
00:59:05.001 --> 00:59:07.337
Give them a taste of Roman steel.

446
00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:13.551
I protest. I most strongly protest.

447
00:59:13.635 --> 00:59:15.970
There are more slaves in Rome
than Romans.

448
00:59:16.012 --> 00:59:20.225
With the garrison absent,
what's to prevent them from rising, too?

449
00:59:20.308 --> 00:59:23.561
I did not say the whole garrison.

450
00:59:23.645 --> 00:59:26.272
Six cohorts will more than do the job.

451
00:59:26.398 --> 00:59:30.276
The rest can stay in Rome
to save you from your housemaids.

452
00:59:32.362 --> 00:59:35.073
Will you accept such a charge, Glabrus?

453
00:59:39.953 --> 00:59:44.666
I accept the charge of the Senate,
if the Senate truly charges me.

454
00:59:45.917 --> 00:59:49.504
The garrison of Rome stands ready.

455
00:59:55.176 --> 00:59:56.636
Slave hunting's a dirty business.

456
00:59:56.678 --> 00:59:58.721
It takes a brave commander to consent to it.

457
00:59:58.805 --> 01:00:03.810
I propose we turn the city out tomorrow
in tribute to Glabrus as he marches through.

458
01:00:06.813 --> 01:00:11.901
And for temporary command of the garrison
during his absence,

459
01:00:11.985 --> 01:00:15.363
I propose Caius Julius Caesar.

460
01:00:30.879 --> 01:00:35.216
You don't look very happy over the new job.

461
01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:38.219
It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.

462
01:00:38.303 --> 01:00:39.512
Maybe.

463
01:00:40.263 --> 01:00:45.018
At least it gives me a chance to separate
Glabrus from Crassus for a while.

464
01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:50.064
You know, this Republic of ours
is something like a rich widow.

465
01:00:50.148 --> 01:00:52.400
Most Romans love her as their mother.

466
01:00:52.442 --> 01:00:56.738
But Crassus dreams of marrying the old girl,
to put it politely.

467
01:00:57.155 --> 01:00:59.616
- Hail Glabrus.
- Hail Glabrus.

468
01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:01.326
Hail Glabrus!

469
01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:09.459
- God be with you, Glabrus.
- And with you, too.

470
01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:18.092
I hope he returns to such applause.

471
01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:21.221
Oh, one fat one, Fimbria.

472
01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:29.771
Keep the change. Give it to your wife.

473
01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:33.775
- May the gods adore you.
- Only through your prayers.

474
01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:38.238
Let's make an old-fashioned sacrifice
for Glabrus' success?

475
01:01:38.279 --> 01:01:40.573
I thought you had reservations
about the gods.

476
01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:43.034
Privately, I believe in none. Neither do you.

477
01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:44.786
Publicly, I believe in them all.

478
01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:47.330
Greetings, Marcus Clodius Flavius!

479
01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:18.653
Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?

480
01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:21.739
- He awaits you in the atrium, sir.
- Excellent.

481
01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:27.662
- What have we here?
- A gift from the Governor of Sicily.

482
01:02:42.844 --> 01:02:46.639
"Antoninus. Sicilian, age 26,

483
01:02:47.932 --> 01:02:49.517
"singer of songs."

484
01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:53.438
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

485
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:57.984
For the children of my master
whom I also taught the classics.

486
01:02:58.026 --> 01:03:00.028
Classics, indeed.

487
01:03:00.236 --> 01:03:04.198
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

488
01:03:04.574 --> 01:03:05.658
Hmm?

489
01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:08.870
You shall be my body servant. Instruct him.

490
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:10.913
All of you, come with me.

491
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.597
Are you on guard duty?

492
01:03:30.683 --> 01:03:33.394
My dear Crassus, congratulate me.

493
01:03:33.478 --> 01:03:36.564
Or better still,
let us congratulate each other.

494
01:03:37.732 --> 01:03:39.400
I congratulate us.

495
01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:44.113
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts of the garrison
against the slaves on Vesuvius.

496
01:03:44.197 --> 01:03:46.699
The whole city is turning out to see us off.

497
01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:49.077
Great merciful bloodstained gods!

498
01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:51.829
Your pardon.

499
01:03:52.038 --> 01:03:55.041
I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

500
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.003
Did Gracchus have something to do
with this brilliant affair?

501
01:03:59.087 --> 01:04:02.423
Yes, he proposed it. Rather decently, too.

502
01:04:02.507 --> 01:04:03.758
And you?

503
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.513
Do you think I made you commander
to control some rock patch on Vesuvius?

504
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.224
It was to control the streets of Rome!

505
01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:15.103
I only take six cohorts.
The rest of the garrison remain.

506
01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:17.605
- Under whose command?
- Under Caesar's.

507
01:04:17.647 --> 01:04:20.316
Oh, excellent, excellent.

508
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.111
Finding Gracchus in control of the mob
and the Senate,

509
01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:26.781
you felt impelled to hand over
the garrison to him also.

510
01:04:28.157 --> 01:04:29.534
I see.

511
01:04:30.076 --> 01:04:33.621
I'll refuse, withdraw from the expedition.

512
01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:35.623
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician

513
01:04:35.707 --> 01:04:38.626
is that occasionally
you're obliged to act like one.

514
01:04:38.668 --> 01:04:40.878
You've pledged to go, and go you must.

515
01:04:40.962 --> 01:04:43.089
If Gracchus should decide to move
against you...

516
01:04:43.131 --> 01:04:45.383
He won't! Has no need to.

517
01:04:45.466 --> 01:04:48.970
He has, with your assistance,
immobilized me altogether.

518
01:04:50.471 --> 01:04:53.558
Your legions are in camp
outside the city walls?

519
01:04:54.434 --> 01:04:55.810
My legions?

520
01:04:56.477 --> 01:04:59.188
Do you truly believe
I'd order my legions to enter Rome?

521
01:04:59.272 --> 01:05:01.983
You can, if you have to.

522
01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:04.318
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law,

523
01:05:04.402 --> 01:05:07.780
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

524
01:05:07.822 --> 01:05:11.325
- Sulla did.
- Sulla? To the infamy of his name!

525
01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:14.162
To the utter damnation of his line!

526
01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:17.749
No, my young friend.

527
01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:22.545
One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

528
01:05:22.837 --> 01:05:26.299
I shall restore all the traditions
that made her great.

529
01:05:27.508 --> 01:05:30.303
It follows that I cannot come to power
or defend myself

530
01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:33.931
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of all.

531
01:05:34.432 --> 01:05:37.935
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

532
01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:41.481
I shall not violate Rome

533
01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:44.442
at the moment of possessing her.

534
01:05:48.696 --> 01:05:49.697
Go.

535
01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:52.492
Prepare your troops at once.

536
01:05:52.533 --> 01:05:56.370
March out of Rome tonight,
but the tribute is impossible.

537
01:05:57.205 --> 01:06:01.083
We've already been made to look a fool.
Let's not add the trappings of a clown.

538
01:06:01.167 --> 01:06:05.296
Leave by unfrequented streets
without fanfare, without even a drum.

539
01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:08.049
Sneak out.

540
01:06:10.218 --> 01:06:11.594
As you wish.

541
01:06:12.428 --> 01:06:14.764
And for heaven's sake, my young friend,

542
01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:18.059
see to it that
you don't have to sneak back again.

543
01:06:19.185 --> 01:06:20.436
Farewell.

544
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:47.833
Come on, fat boy!

545
01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:32.503
- Spartacus, come on!
- Come on!

546
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:34.171
Noble Romans.

547
01:09:34.672 --> 01:09:36.757
Fighting each other like animals.

548
01:09:38.009 --> 01:09:40.594
Your new masters,
betting to see who'll die first.

549
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:45.558
Drop your swords.

550
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.686
- No! No!
- No! No!

551
01:09:52.815 --> 01:09:56.610
I want to see their blood
here where Draba died!

552
01:09:58.487 --> 01:10:01.782
When I fight matched pairs,
they fight to the death.

553
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.536
I made myself a promise, Crixus.

554
01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:07.705
I swore that if I ever got out of this place,

555
01:10:07.788 --> 01:10:11.000
I'd die before I'd watch two men
fight to the death again.

556
01:10:15.004 --> 01:10:17.214
Draba made that promise, too.

557
01:10:18.674 --> 01:10:20.051
He kept it.

558
01:10:21.761 --> 01:10:23.095
So will I.

559
01:10:26.474 --> 01:10:28.559
Go on. Get out!

560
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:34.148
What are we, Crixus?

561
01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:36.817
What are we becoming? Romans?

562
01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:39.904
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?

563
01:10:39.987 --> 01:10:42.406
We look for wine
when we should be hunting bread.

564
01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:45.159
When you've got wine,
you don't need bread!

565
01:10:46.744 --> 01:10:49.830
We can't just be a gang of drunken raiders.

566
01:10:49.872 --> 01:10:52.333
- What else can we be?
- Gladiators.

567
01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:55.336
An army of gladiators.

568
01:10:56.003 --> 01:10:58.339
There's never been an army like that.

569
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.092
One gladiator's worth
any two Roman soldiers.

570
01:11:01.175 --> 01:11:04.011
We beat the Roman guards here,
but a Roman army's different.

571
01:11:04.053 --> 01:11:06.222
They fight different.

572
01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:09.350
We can beat anything they send against us
if we want to.

573
01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:12.853
- It takes a big army.
- We'll have a big army.

574
01:11:12.937 --> 01:11:17.024
Once we're on the march, we'll free
every slave in every town and village.

575
01:11:17.108 --> 01:11:19.068
Can anybody get a bigger army?

576
01:11:19.151 --> 01:11:21.362
Once we cross the Alps, we're safe.

577
01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:24.698
Nobody can cross the Alps.
Every pass is defended by its own legion.

578
01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.868
There's only one way
to get out of this country.

579
01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:29.995
The sea.

580
01:11:30.037 --> 01:11:32.790
What good is the sea if you have no ships?

581
01:11:32.873 --> 01:11:35.209
The Cilician pirates have ships.

582
01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:37.419
They're at war with Rome.

583
01:11:38.087 --> 01:11:41.382
Every Roman galley
that sails out of Brundusium pays tribute.

584
01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:44.718
They've got the biggest fleet in the world.
I was a galley slave with them.

585
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.637
Give them enough gold,
they'll take you anywhere.

586
01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.930
We haven't got enough gold.

587
01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:50.724
Take every Roman we capture
and warm his back a little.

588
01:11:50.766 --> 01:11:52.893
- We'll have gold all right.

589
01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:55.521
Spartacus is right!

590
01:11:55.896 --> 01:11:58.941
Let's hire these pirates
and march straight to Brundusium!

591
01:12:45.696 --> 01:12:48.782
Come join us.
All of you, come join us.

592
01:13:06.675 --> 01:13:08.302
Come on and join us!

593
01:13:21.732 --> 01:13:22.942
Come on!

594
01:13:22.983 --> 01:13:24.193
Hey!

595
01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:36.038
Back to Vesuvius!

596
01:13:57.268 --> 01:13:58.519
Varinia.

597
01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:06.402
I thought I'd never see you again.

598
01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:22.835
Everything's so different.

599
01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:31.385
The last time I saw you, you...

600
01:14:32.386 --> 01:14:36.265
You were waiting in the arena to...

601
01:14:42.438 --> 01:14:45.816
I... I thought you were in Rome.

602
01:14:48.944 --> 01:14:50.070
Oh...

603
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:52.656
How'd you escape?

604
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.283
I...

605
01:14:55.242 --> 01:14:59.330
I jumped out of the cart
and Batiatus was so fat...

606
01:15:10.341 --> 01:15:12.760
I flew out of the cart

607
01:15:14.303 --> 01:15:16.680
and Batiatus was so fat

608
01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:19.850
that he couldn't catch me.

609
01:15:19.933 --> 01:15:22.102
He couldn't catch up with me.

610
01:15:22.853 --> 01:15:24.813
Do you realize

611
01:15:24.897 --> 01:15:28.150
nobody can ever sell you again?

612
01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:30.110
Nobody can sell you.

613
01:15:30.194 --> 01:15:32.780
- Or give you away.
- Or give you away.

614
01:15:32.821 --> 01:15:35.115
Nobody can ever
make you stay with anyone.

615
01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:37.659
Nobody can make you stay with anybody.

616
01:15:39.912 --> 01:15:42.623
Oh, I love you, Spartacus.

617
01:15:46.627 --> 01:15:50.047
I love you. I love you. I love you.

618
01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:54.468
I still can't believe it.

619
01:15:57.262 --> 01:16:01.141
Forbid me ever to leave you.

620
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:08.816
I do forbid you.

621
01:16:11.318 --> 01:16:12.778
I forbid you.

622
01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:16.073
I forbid you.

623
01:16:17.157 --> 01:16:19.159
I forbid you.

624
01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:45.144
It was funny at the time.

625
01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:48.856
How good you are to me, if I may say so.

626
01:16:48.897 --> 01:16:50.691
- You may.
- Thank you.

627
01:16:51.483 --> 01:16:53.402
Don't just eye those birds. Eat them.

628
01:16:53.485 --> 01:16:56.238
There's no need
to be on your best behavior here.

629
01:16:56.321 --> 01:17:01.326
May I remind you
you've been good to me in the past.

630
01:17:01.368 --> 01:17:04.079
- I've been good to you?
- Oh, yes.

631
01:17:04.163 --> 01:17:08.625
You've sold me slaves
at an extremely reasonable price.

632
01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:13.464
And you arranged gladiatorial jousts
at cost, practically.

633
01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:16.633
You are both ethical in business

634
01:17:16.717 --> 01:17:19.887
and certainly farsighted socially.

635
01:17:20.095 --> 01:17:22.514
Zenobia's put on weight
since I last saw her.

636
01:17:22.556 --> 01:17:25.058
- Hasn't she? I like it.
- So do I.

637
01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:29.313
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

638
01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:33.025
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

639
01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:36.987
Have you noticed the nastiest of tyrants
are invariably thin?

640
01:17:39.239 --> 01:17:43.452
In spite of your vices, you are
the most generous Roman of our time.

641
01:17:43.535 --> 01:17:44.828
Vices?

642
01:17:47.289 --> 01:17:48.499
Ladies.

643
01:17:51.668 --> 01:17:54.254
Ladies? Since when are they a vice?

644
01:17:54.755 --> 01:17:58.300
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

645
01:17:58.383 --> 01:18:00.761
I hope I pronounced that word...

646
01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:03.680
It's well-known that
even your groom and butler are women.

647
01:18:03.764 --> 01:18:06.183
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.

648
01:18:06.475 --> 01:18:10.020
I keep these women out of my respect
for Roman morality.

649
01:18:10.187 --> 01:18:12.481
That morality which
has made Rome strong enough

650
01:18:12.564 --> 01:18:15.275
to steal two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners,

651
01:18:15.359 --> 01:18:18.946
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

652
01:18:19.029 --> 01:18:22.449
I happen to like women.
I have a promiscuous nature

653
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:25.577
and unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow

654
01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:28.247
which my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

655
01:18:28.288 --> 01:18:31.583
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

656
01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:32.876
Exactly.

657
01:18:34.044 --> 01:18:37.673
It must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity.

658
01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:42.970
It is.

659
01:18:43.512 --> 01:18:47.057
Let's mix business with pleasure.
How may I help you?

660
01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:53.063
Great Gracchus, I find it difficult to hate,

661
01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:55.482
but there's one man
I can't think of without fuming.

662
01:18:55.524 --> 01:18:56.984
- Who's that?
- Crassus.

663
01:18:57.067 --> 01:18:59.820
You've grown very ambitious in your hatred.

664
01:18:59.861 --> 01:19:03.323
Do you blame me? There I was,
better than a millionaire in the morning

665
01:19:03.365 --> 01:19:07.744
and a penniless refugee by nightfall
with nothing but rags and my flesh.

666
01:19:07.828 --> 01:19:11.164
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua

667
01:19:11.206 --> 01:19:14.376
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs.

668
01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:17.421
These two daughters of Venus

669
01:19:17.504 --> 01:19:20.215
had to taunt the gladiators,
force them to fight to the death,

670
01:19:20.299 --> 01:19:23.343
and before I knew what had happened,
revolution on my hands.

671
01:19:23.385 --> 01:19:27.222
What revenge have you in mind?

672
01:19:29.016 --> 01:19:32.060
- I sold Crassus this woman Varinia.
- Whom?

673
01:19:32.936 --> 01:19:35.647
Varinia. May the gods give her wings.

674
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:36.732
There was no contract,

675
01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:40.652
but she was clearly his slave
as soon as the deal was made.

676
01:19:40.694 --> 01:19:43.280
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

677
01:19:43.363 --> 01:19:46.658
And Crassus,
no mention of money.

678
01:19:47.576 --> 01:19:50.370
You never offered me this woman. Why not?

679
01:19:51.038 --> 01:19:53.707
Well, she's not
remotely your type, Gracchus.

680
01:19:53.749 --> 01:19:56.710
- She is very thin and...
- Look around you.

681
01:19:57.169 --> 01:20:01.548
- You'll see women of all sizes.
- Well, yes.

682
01:20:01.632 --> 01:20:04.509
500 sesterces deposit on Varinia.

683
01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:08.764
Since he hasn't paid, this gives me first call
over Crassus when she's caught.

684
01:20:09.348 --> 01:20:11.224
May the gods adore you.

685
01:20:12.184 --> 01:20:14.394
Why do you buy a woman
you've never seen?

686
01:20:14.478 --> 01:20:17.314
To annoy Crassus, of course, and help you.

687
01:20:24.363 --> 01:20:26.406
Fetch a stool, Antoninus.

688
01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:34.331
In here with it.

689
01:20:41.129 --> 01:20:42.589
That will do.

690
01:20:49.805 --> 01:20:51.765
Do you steal, Antoninus?

691
01:20:52.057 --> 01:20:53.433
No, master.

692
01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:55.769
Do you lie?

693
01:20:56.937 --> 01:20:58.772
Not if I can avoid it.

694
01:21:00.315 --> 01:21:03.694
Have you ever dishonored the gods?

695
01:21:03.777 --> 01:21:05.153
No, master.

696
01:21:06.488 --> 01:21:10.742
Do you refrain from these vices
out of respect for the moral virtues?

697
01:21:11.410 --> 01:21:12.786
Yes, master.

698
01:21:16.957 --> 01:21:18.667
Do you eat oysters?

699
01:21:19.543 --> 01:21:21.545
When I have them, master.

700
01:21:22.337 --> 01:21:24.005
Do you eat snails?

701
01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.425
No, master.

702
01:21:28.427 --> 01:21:30.804
Do you consider
the eating of oysters to be moral

703
01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:33.598
and the eating of snails to be immoral?

704
01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.643
No, master.

705
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:39.062
Of course not.

706
01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:44.943
It is all a matter of taste, isn't it?

707
01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:46.820
Yes, master.

708
01:21:48.113 --> 01:21:50.699
And taste is not the same as appetite

709
01:21:51.324 --> 01:21:54.327
and therefore
not a question of morals, is it?

710
01:21:56.621 --> 01:21:57.664
Mmm.

711
01:22:00.292 --> 01:22:02.502
It could be argued so, master.

712
01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:08.675
That will do. My robe, Antoninus.

713
01:22:25.358 --> 01:22:27.235
My taste includes

714
01:22:28.445 --> 01:22:30.906
both snails and oysters.

715
01:22:40.207 --> 01:22:41.833
Antoninus, look.

716
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:44.836
Across the river.

717
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:48.507
There is something you must see.

718
01:22:52.844 --> 01:22:55.597
There, boy, is Rome.

719
01:22:57.015 --> 01:22:59.184
The might, the majesty,

720
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.312
the terror of Rome.

721
01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:08.777
There is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus.

722
01:23:10.529 --> 01:23:12.572
No man can withstand Rome.

723
01:23:13.782 --> 01:23:15.909
No nation can withstand her.

724
01:23:17.702 --> 01:23:19.162
How much less

725
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.748
a boy?

726
01:23:24.251 --> 01:23:25.293
Hmm?

727
01:23:28.964 --> 01:23:32.175
There's only one way
to deal with Rome, Antoninus.

728
01:23:32.926 --> 01:23:34.636
You must serve her.

729
01:23:36.388 --> 01:23:38.890
You must abase yourself before her.

730
01:23:41.268 --> 01:23:43.436
You must grovel at her feet.

731
01:23:45.814 --> 01:23:49.234
You must love her.

732
01:23:54.114 --> 01:23:56.116
Isn't that so, Antoninus?

733
01:23:59.953 --> 01:24:01.288
Antoninus!

734
01:24:04.583 --> 01:24:05.917
Antoninus?

735
01:25:39.052 --> 01:25:40.762
Take your time!

736
01:25:40.845 --> 01:25:42.263
- How are they coming?
- Good.

737
01:25:42.347 --> 01:25:45.225
Give me another thousand like them
and we can march on Rome.

738
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:47.102
Come on, once again.

739
01:26:03.326 --> 01:26:07.747
Here, on Vesuvius, we're safe from attack
while we organize ourselves into an army.

740
01:26:07.831 --> 01:26:10.166
It may take six months, a year.

741
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:13.962
Once we're strong,
we're gonna fight our way south to the sea.

742
01:26:14.045 --> 01:26:17.215
We're going to arrange
for ships with the Cilician pirates.

743
01:26:17.257 --> 01:26:19.509
The sea will be our road home.

744
01:26:20.427 --> 01:26:22.679
If you agree, you may join us.

745
01:26:22.846 --> 01:26:26.641
If you don't agree,
go back before your escape is discovered.

746
01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:29.728
Too many women.

747
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:32.272
What's wrong with women?

748
01:26:32.355 --> 01:26:34.607
Where would you be now, you lout,

749
01:26:34.691 --> 01:26:37.152
if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell

750
01:26:37.235 --> 01:26:39.237
to get you into this accursed world?

751
01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:42.323
I can handle a knife in the dark
as well as anyone.

752
01:26:42.407 --> 01:26:44.617
I can cast spells and brew poisons.

753
01:26:44.659 --> 01:26:47.787
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters.

754
01:26:49.998 --> 01:26:53.793
- I want to see Spartacus.
- All right, grandmother. I'm Spartacus.

755
01:26:53.877 --> 01:26:55.253
Stay with us.

756
01:26:55.295 --> 01:26:58.339
We'll need a million Roman shrouds
before we're through.

757
01:27:02.052 --> 01:27:06.139
- Where do you come from?
- Most of us come from the estate of Lillius.

758
01:27:06.181 --> 01:27:09.726
- What kind of work did you do there?
- Sixteen years a carpenter, a mason.

759
01:27:09.809 --> 01:27:12.062
Good. We can use carpenters.

760
01:27:14.314 --> 01:27:16.775
- What kind of work did you do?
- Chief steward.

761
01:27:16.816 --> 01:27:20.195
You'll help with the food supplies.
Report to Patullus.

762
01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:23.448
What kind of work did you do?

763
01:27:24.491 --> 01:27:26.076
Singer of songs.

764
01:27:26.785 --> 01:27:28.369
Singer of songs?

765
01:27:28.578 --> 01:27:30.580
But what work did you do?

766
01:27:30.914 --> 01:27:33.166
That's my work. I also juggle.

767
01:27:33.917 --> 01:27:36.044
Juggle. What else do you do?

768
01:27:36.586 --> 01:27:38.546
I can do feats of magic.

769
01:27:39.005 --> 01:27:40.173
Magic?

770
01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:43.301
Maybe he can make the Romans disappear.

771
01:29:11.514 --> 01:29:13.683
I'll need one volunteer, man or woman.

772
01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:15.977
How about you? You, sir?

773
01:29:16.978 --> 01:29:18.938
Here we have a likely subject.

774
01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:23.610
You'll notice there is nothing
in my hand, true?

775
01:29:24.194 --> 01:29:28.322
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

776
01:29:28.448 --> 01:29:32.327
I make a bowl. My hand is upside down
and I ask you to blow at it.

777
01:29:33.453 --> 01:29:34.954
Not hard enough. Hard!

778
01:29:36.623 --> 01:29:37.874
Thank you.

779
01:29:45.465 --> 01:29:47.342
Would you like to try?

780
01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:53.431
Hit it against the rock, gently.

781
01:30:01.481 --> 01:30:03.983
Poet, I haven't had an egg in days.

782
01:30:05.318 --> 01:30:06.736
You haven't?

783
01:30:10.198 --> 01:30:11.824
- Here.
- Thank you.

784
01:30:12.617 --> 01:30:15.119
I'm not going to let mine get away.

785
01:30:34.889 --> 01:30:38.184
- Sing us a song.
- Sing us a song, Antoninus.

786
01:30:38.935 --> 01:30:40.520
Sing, Antoninus.

787
01:30:43.815 --> 01:30:47.235
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky,

788
01:30:49.195 --> 01:30:51.864
when the wind dies away on the mountain,

789
01:30:54.534 --> 01:30:57.787
when the song of the meadowlark turns still,

790
01:31:00.164 --> 01:31:03.376
when the field locust clicks no more
in the field,

791
01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:08.506
and the sea foam sleeps
like a maiden at rest,

792
01:31:09.299 --> 01:31:12.719
and twilight touches the shape
of the wondering earth,

793
01:31:13.219 --> 01:31:14.595
<i>I turn home.</i>

794
01:31:15.888 --> 01:31:18.474
<i>Through blue shadows and purple woods,</i>

795
01:31:19.684 --> 01:31:21.060
<i>I turn home.</i>

796
01:31:22.562 --> 01:31:25.106
<i>I turn to the place that I was born,</i>

797
01:31:25.398 --> 01:31:28.818
<i>to the mother who bore me</i>
<i>and the father who taught me,</i>

798
01:31:29.235 --> 01:31:32.989
<i>long ago, long ago, long ago.</i>

799
01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:39.495
<i>Alone am I now, lost and alone</i>
<i>in a far, wide, wondering world.</i>

800
01:31:41.331 --> 01:31:44.792
Yet still when the blazing sun hangs low,

801
01:31:46.753 --> 01:31:49.839
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps,

802
01:31:51.424 --> 01:31:54.260
and twilight touches the wondering earth,

803
01:31:56.095 --> 01:31:57.513
I turn home.

804
01:32:03.686 --> 01:32:05.813
Where'd you learn that song?

805
01:32:06.606 --> 01:32:08.608
My father taught it to me.

806
01:32:09.692 --> 01:32:11.819
I was wrong about you, poet.

807
01:32:12.153 --> 01:32:14.530
You won't learn to kill.
You'll teach us songs.

808
01:32:14.614 --> 01:32:16.407
I came here to fight.

809
01:32:18.451 --> 01:32:20.453
Anyone can learn to fight.

810
01:32:21.287 --> 01:32:22.955
I joined to fight.

811
01:32:26.876 --> 01:32:29.962
- What's your name?
- Antoninus.

812
01:32:32.048 --> 01:32:33.383
Antoninus.

813
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:37.804
There's a time for fighting
and a time for singing.

814
01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:40.306
Now you teach us to sing.

815
01:32:40.848 --> 01:32:42.475
Sing, Antoninus.

816
01:32:49.399 --> 01:32:52.443
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky...

817
01:32:54.404 --> 01:32:56.364
You like him, don't you?

818
01:33:00.827 --> 01:33:02.578
Who wants to fight?

819
01:33:05.623 --> 01:33:07.834
An animal can learn to fight.

820
01:33:11.337 --> 01:33:13.506
But to sing beautiful things

821
01:33:15.133 --> 01:33:17.427
and make people believe them...

822
01:33:27.437 --> 01:33:29.564
What are you thinking about?

823
01:33:37.155 --> 01:33:38.406
I'm free.

824
01:33:40.658 --> 01:33:42.368
And what do I know?

825
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:46.080
I don't even know how to read.

826
01:33:48.207 --> 01:33:50.835
You know things that can't be taught.

827
01:33:53.212 --> 01:33:54.755
I know nothing.

828
01:33:55.673 --> 01:33:56.924
Nothing.

829
01:34:00.052 --> 01:34:03.473
And I want to know. I want to...

830
01:34:07.226 --> 01:34:08.769
I want to know.

831
01:34:10.313 --> 01:34:11.647
Know what?

832
01:34:16.402 --> 01:34:17.737
Everything.

833
01:34:20.239 --> 01:34:22.909
Why a star falls and a bird doesn't.

834
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:26.037
Where the sun goes at night.

835
01:34:26.746 --> 01:34:28.831
Why the moon changes shape.

836
01:34:33.586 --> 01:34:36.422
I want to know where the wind comes from.

837
01:34:43.513 --> 01:34:45.556
The wind begins in a cave.

838
01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:50.686
Far to the north,
a young god sleeps in that cave.

839
01:34:51.938 --> 01:34:55.399
He dreams of a girl and he sighs,

840
01:34:56.859 --> 01:35:00.071
and the night wind stirs with his breath.

841
01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.791
I want to know all about you.

842
01:35:15.211 --> 01:35:19.423
Every line, every curve.

843
01:35:23.469 --> 01:35:25.846
I want to know every part of you.

844
01:35:28.808 --> 01:35:30.810
Every beat of your heart.

845
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:58.170
Go on about the city of Metapontum.

846
01:35:59.338 --> 01:36:01.799
What garrisons will we find there?

847
01:36:03.384 --> 01:36:06.971
There are two legions in the garrison.
Some have been sent south...

848
01:36:07.013 --> 01:36:09.056
Set the litter down there.

849
01:36:25.031 --> 01:36:28.284
Well, where is this slave general?

850
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:34.415
Dionysius, get the litter bearers
out of the rain.

851
01:36:34.498 --> 01:36:37.209
Give them food, a bed and their freedom.

852
01:36:39.128 --> 01:36:42.173
- All right, follow me.
- We'll pay you for them.

853
01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.675
We have no slaves in this camp.

854
01:36:50.306 --> 01:36:52.725
Tigranes Levantus at your service.

855
01:36:53.392 --> 01:36:54.977
My credentials.

856
01:36:59.857 --> 01:37:01.108
Come in.

857
01:37:04.612 --> 01:37:07.281
"To the General of the Italian slaves
called Spartacus

858
01:37:07.365 --> 01:37:10.326
"from Ibar M'hali,
Cilician Governor of Delos."

859
01:37:10.409 --> 01:37:12.411
- Sit down.
- "Greetings.

860
01:37:12.495 --> 01:37:17.166
"Word has been received that you wish
to embark your armies on the Cilician ships

861
01:37:17.249 --> 01:37:19.418
"from the Italian port of Brundusium.

862
01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:22.380
- "Receive my agent, Tigranes..."
- Levantus.

863
01:37:23.005 --> 01:37:24.423
"...who bargains in my name.

864
01:37:24.507 --> 01:37:27.426
"May Isis and Serapis
bring victory to your cause.

865
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:28.844
"The Governor of Delos."

866
01:37:28.928 --> 01:37:32.223
- Who are Isis and Serapis?
- Gods of the East.

867
01:37:32.515 --> 01:37:34.809
Why should they want us to win?

868
01:37:35.017 --> 01:37:38.688
Because they favor Cilicia,

869
01:37:38.771 --> 01:37:41.941
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

870
01:37:46.237 --> 01:37:48.239
Would you like some wine?

871
01:37:48.781 --> 01:37:52.660
I drink only after the bargain
has been concluded, never before.

872
01:38:01.293 --> 01:38:05.589
- How many ships do these Cilicians have?
- Five hundred, at least.

873
01:38:06.298 --> 01:38:08.426
But no deal is too small, I assure you.

874
01:38:08.467 --> 01:38:10.261
We'll need them all.

875
01:38:10.803 --> 01:38:13.472
- All?
- What is the price?

876
01:38:14.807 --> 01:38:19.019
Price is 100,000 sesterces per ship.

877
01:38:20.396 --> 01:38:23.315
For 500 ships, that would be

878
01:38:24.316 --> 01:38:26.652
50 million sesterces.

879
01:38:28.154 --> 01:38:31.907
- You have such a sum?
- We will have.

880
01:38:36.036 --> 01:38:37.663
See for yourself.

881
01:38:41.292 --> 01:38:42.668
Beautiful.

882
01:38:42.710 --> 01:38:45.504
- When will the ships be ready?
- Beautiful.

883
01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:48.174
I love to see such beauty.

884
01:38:48.215 --> 01:38:50.426
When will the ships be ready?

885
01:38:51.177 --> 01:38:54.430
Ah, my friend, when will you be ready?

886
01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:58.100
How long will it take you

887
01:38:59.935 --> 01:39:04.690
to cross one-third the length of Italy
fighting a major battle in every town?

888
01:39:04.732 --> 01:39:06.525
One year? Two years?

889
01:39:07.401 --> 01:39:11.739
If we're not in Brundusium seven months
from now, we'll never be there.

890
01:39:14.033 --> 01:39:16.452
What if we assemble the ships,

891
01:39:17.703 --> 01:39:20.873
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them?

892
01:39:21.957 --> 01:39:26.045
We'll give you a chest of treasure now,
the rest when we get to Brundusium.

893
01:39:26.086 --> 01:39:28.047
- This one?
- Yes.

894
01:39:29.715 --> 01:39:30.841
Done!

895
01:39:31.217 --> 01:39:34.386
Seven months from now
the ships will be assembled.

896
01:39:35.429 --> 01:39:37.848
Arrange to have the chest loaded.

897
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:39.767
And now, with your permission,

898
01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:42.311
I should like to have the wine
you offered me.

899
01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:44.897
- Will you join me?
- I will.

900
01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.607
Excellent workmanship.

901
01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:48.901
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

902
01:39:48.984 --> 01:39:52.071
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

903
01:39:52.404 --> 01:39:54.365
I'm the son and grandson of slaves.

904
01:39:54.448 --> 01:39:57.284
I knew that, when I saw you couldn't read.

905
01:39:58.452 --> 01:40:02.206
Of course, it pleases Roman vanity
to think that you are noble.

906
01:40:02.248 --> 01:40:05.000
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves,

907
01:40:05.084 --> 01:40:07.294
especially a man like Crassus.

908
01:40:09.255 --> 01:40:13.676
- You know him?
- I entertained him one afternoon.

909
01:40:14.093 --> 01:40:16.345
- You?
- In the arena.

910
01:40:18.931 --> 01:40:20.474
Excellent wine.

911
01:40:22.434 --> 01:40:23.769
May I...

912
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:27.481
- May I ask you something?
- You can ask.

913
01:40:27.773 --> 01:40:30.860
Surely you know
you're going to lose, don't you?

914
01:40:32.778 --> 01:40:34.113
You have no chance.

915
01:40:34.196 --> 01:40:37.283
At this very moment,
six cohorts of the garrison of Rome

916
01:40:37.324 --> 01:40:39.577
are approaching this position.

917
01:40:42.079 --> 01:40:44.081
What are you going to do?

918
01:40:49.128 --> 01:40:51.755
We'll decide that when they get here.

919
01:40:56.051 --> 01:40:58.095
Let me put it differently.

920
01:40:58.262 --> 01:41:00.973
If you looked into a magic crystal

921
01:41:01.807 --> 01:41:05.311
and you saw your army destroyed
and yourself dead,

922
01:41:06.061 --> 01:41:10.858
if you saw that in the future,
as I'm sure you're seeing it now,

923
01:41:11.317 --> 01:41:13.444
would you continue to fight?

924
01:41:14.278 --> 01:41:15.321
Yes.

925
01:41:15.362 --> 01:41:17.489
Knowing that you must lose?

926
01:41:18.657 --> 01:41:20.326
Knowing we can't.

927
01:41:21.827 --> 01:41:24.163
All men lose when they die.

928
01:41:24.204 --> 01:41:28.250
And all men die, but a slave
and a free man lose different things.

929
01:41:28.334 --> 01:41:30.127
They both lose life.

930
01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:33.505
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

931
01:41:34.506 --> 01:41:36.425
A slave loses his pain.

932
01:41:38.469 --> 01:41:41.180
Death is the only freedom a slave knows.

933
01:41:41.472 --> 01:41:43.849
That's why he's not afraid of it.

934
01:41:45.851 --> 01:41:47.686
That's why we'll win.

935
01:42:16.298 --> 01:42:18.717
Spartacus, that pirate was right.

936
01:42:20.970 --> 01:42:23.973
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

937
01:42:25.057 --> 01:42:27.726
- How many are there?
- About six cohorts.

938
01:42:28.018 --> 01:42:29.144
Where?

939
01:42:29.228 --> 01:42:31.897
At the mouth of the valley,
against the cliffs.

940
01:42:34.775 --> 01:42:38.070
- Strong camp?
- They've built no stockade.

941
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:41.448
No stockade?

942
01:42:41.907 --> 01:42:44.535
- Are you sure?
- I'm very sure.

943
01:42:44.868 --> 01:42:47.538
This campaign is great sport for them.

944
01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:49.915
The Romans are having a picnic.

945
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:52.668
- Did they see you?
- No. We were hidden.

946
01:42:56.046 --> 01:42:58.757
Maybe we ought to join this Roman picnic.

947
01:42:58.841 --> 01:43:00.342
Form your men.

948
01:43:06.265 --> 01:43:07.683
Six cohorts.

949
01:43:08.934 --> 01:43:13.480
A lot of arms and weapons
to build our army with.

950
01:43:41.425 --> 01:43:44.053
Crixus always wanted to march on Rome.

951
01:43:45.095 --> 01:43:46.972
Now he doesn't have to.

952
01:43:47.765 --> 01:43:49.433
Rome's come to us.

953
01:44:55.624 --> 01:44:58.127
Half this way! The rest over there.

954
01:45:19.314 --> 01:45:22.693
Stand up, the way a noble Roman should!

955
01:45:23.026 --> 01:45:25.112
That's Roman pride for you!

956
01:45:31.535 --> 01:45:33.036
That's better.

957
01:45:34.913 --> 01:45:36.582
What's your name?

958
01:45:37.332 --> 01:45:39.334
Marcus Glabrus.

959
01:45:39.877 --> 01:45:41.086
Glabrus.

960
01:45:41.962 --> 01:45:44.256
Commander of the garrison of Rome.

961
01:45:45.007 --> 01:45:46.091
Commander?

962
01:45:46.175 --> 01:45:48.927
He was commanding it on his belly
when we found him, playing dead!

963
01:45:53.515 --> 01:45:55.934
You disappoint me, Marcus Glabrus.

964
01:45:56.935 --> 01:45:58.437
Playing dead.

965
01:46:00.272 --> 01:46:01.940
You afraid to die?

966
01:46:03.817 --> 01:46:05.444
It's easy to die.

967
01:46:06.278 --> 01:46:07.946
Haven't you seen enough gladiators
in the arena

968
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:10.240
to see how easy it is to die?

969
01:46:10.782 --> 01:46:12.534
Of course you have.

970
01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.578
What are you...

971
01:46:15.579 --> 01:46:17.873
What are you going to do to me?

972
01:46:17.956 --> 01:46:19.416
I don't know.

973
01:46:21.084 --> 01:46:25.255
- What should we do with him?
- Let's have a matched pair, him and me.

974
01:46:27.132 --> 01:46:29.509
I'll not fight like a gladiator!

975
01:46:34.890 --> 01:46:36.892
You keep staring at this.

976
01:46:37.643 --> 01:46:39.770
Do you recognize this baton?

977
01:46:40.896 --> 01:46:42.522
- Yes!
- You should!

978
01:46:43.148 --> 01:46:44.900
It was in your tent.

979
01:46:47.027 --> 01:46:48.987
The symbol of the Senate.

980
01:46:49.112 --> 01:46:50.989
All the power of Rome!

981
01:46:54.076 --> 01:46:56.078
That's the power of Rome!

982
01:46:58.956 --> 01:47:01.166
Take that back to your Senate.

983
01:47:01.458 --> 01:47:05.545
Tell them you and that broken stick
is all that's left of the garrison of Rome!

984
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:08.340
Tell them we want nothing from Rome.

985
01:47:08.423 --> 01:47:11.051
Nothing, except our freedom!

986
01:47:11.134 --> 01:47:14.012
All we want is to get out
of this damn country!

987
01:47:14.054 --> 01:47:16.348
We're marching south to the sea.

988
01:47:16.431 --> 01:47:19.017
And we'll smash every army
they send against us.

989
01:47:19.101 --> 01:47:20.560
Put him on a horse!

990
01:50:20.657 --> 01:50:24.536
Their leader said
their hatred of Rome was such

991
01:50:24.619 --> 01:50:27.539
that all they wished
was to escape from her rule.

992
01:50:27.622 --> 01:50:31.626
If unopposed,
he promised a peaceful march to the sea.

993
01:50:31.710 --> 01:50:35.172
If opposed,
he threatens to ravage the countryside

994
01:50:35.213 --> 01:50:37.632
and destroy every legion sent against him.

995
01:50:37.716 --> 01:50:39.634
And once they get to the sea?

996
01:50:39.718 --> 01:50:44.222
They plan to take ship with Cilician pirates
and return to their homes.

997
01:50:44.306 --> 01:50:46.850
From which port
do they propose to embark?

998
01:50:46.892 --> 01:50:48.393
I don't know.

999
01:50:48.810 --> 01:50:51.354
But city garrisons can't stand up to them.

1000
01:50:51.396 --> 01:50:54.399
If they are to be intercepted,
it's work for the legions!

1001
01:50:54.483 --> 01:50:57.569
What sort of a man
is this leader of the slaves?

1002
01:50:58.153 --> 01:50:59.863
I don't know.

1003
01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.741
I think they called him Spartacus.

1004
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:05.285
Spartacus.

1005
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:09.080
Is that name familiar to you?

1006
01:51:10.415 --> 01:51:12.417
Yes, it does seem to be.

1007
01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:15.086
I can't place it.

1008
01:51:15.837 --> 01:51:18.465
After he talked to you, what happened?

1009
01:51:19.007 --> 01:51:21.927
I was tied to a horse
and lashed out of camp.

1010
01:51:24.095 --> 01:51:26.473
How many of your company escaped?

1011
01:51:27.432 --> 01:51:29.726
Fourteen have reported thus far.

1012
01:51:29.768 --> 01:51:32.938
I, myself, was taken prisoner
in my own command tent.

1013
01:51:33.021 --> 01:51:37.275
The camp was thoroughly infiltrated
before an alarm could be sounded.

1014
01:51:38.235 --> 01:51:41.947
Did you surround your camp
with moat and stockade?

1015
01:51:50.539 --> 01:51:51.581
No.

1016
01:51:53.124 --> 01:51:57.212
We arrived after sunset.
Sentries were posted every 10 paces.

1017
01:51:57.295 --> 01:52:00.465
There was no reason
to expect an attack by night.

1018
01:52:00.966 --> 01:52:03.885
Then again, well, they...

1019
01:52:07.097 --> 01:52:08.348
Continue.

1020
01:52:10.976 --> 01:52:12.852
They were only slaves.

1021
01:52:16.231 --> 01:52:17.399
I see.

1022
01:52:20.235 --> 01:52:24.406
I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus
has disgraced the arms of Rome.

1023
01:52:25.657 --> 01:52:28.702
Let the punishment of the Senate
be pronounced.

1024
01:52:33.707 --> 01:52:36.835
If we punished every commander
who made a fool of himself,

1025
01:52:36.876 --> 01:52:40.171
we wouldn't have anyone left
above the rank of centurion.

1026
01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:44.509
But this is a case of criminal carelessness!

1027
01:52:45.010 --> 01:52:47.429
Six cohorts have been slaughtered.

1028
01:52:47.887 --> 01:52:52.517
Crassus sponsored this young man.
Let him pronounce sentence.

1029
01:52:56.479 --> 01:52:58.690
The punishment is well-known!

1030
01:53:00.942 --> 01:53:05.322
Let Publius Marcus Glabrus be denied
fire, water, food and shelter

1031
01:53:05.363 --> 01:53:08.700
for a distance of 400 miles in all directions
from the city of Rome.

1032
01:53:13.663 --> 01:53:15.206
One thing more.

1033
01:53:15.874 --> 01:53:20.295
Glabrus is my friend and I will not
dissociate myself from his disgrace.

1034
01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:25.175
I now lay down the command of my legions
and retire to private life.

1035
01:53:37.812 --> 01:53:39.439
Goodbye, Crassus.

1036
01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:45.862
This is no time for a man of honor
to withdraw from public affairs!

1037
01:53:45.904 --> 01:53:49.074
- Shame, shame!
- Sit down.

1038
01:53:49.199 --> 01:53:52.702
This sort of heroic
public behavior is nothing new.

1039
01:53:52.744 --> 01:53:55.580
I've seen it before,
and I know the meaning of it.

1040
01:53:55.664 --> 01:53:58.958
- Crassus acted on a point of honor!
- Patrician honor!

1041
01:53:59.793 --> 01:54:02.253
No matter how noble this looks
from the outside,

1042
01:54:02.295 --> 01:54:04.339
I don't like the color of it.

1043
01:54:04.422 --> 01:54:06.383
Crassus is the only man in Rome

1044
01:54:06.424 --> 01:54:10.428
who hasn't yielded to republican corruption
and never will!

1045
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:14.683
I'll take a little republican corruption
along with a little republican freedom

1046
01:54:14.766 --> 01:54:18.728
but I won't take the dictatorship of Crassus

1047
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:21.106
and no freedom at all!

1048
01:54:23.191 --> 01:54:27.445
That's what he's out for
and that's why he'll be back.

1049
01:58:18.927 --> 01:58:21.930
To the mother that bore me,

1050
01:58:23.431 --> 01:58:26.059
to the father that taught me,

1051
01:58:27.852 --> 01:58:29.354
to the god...

1052
01:58:32.649 --> 01:58:36.069
To the blue woods
and the purple shadows, I...

1053
01:58:36.152 --> 01:58:38.696
To blue shadows and purple woods.

1054
01:58:39.447 --> 01:58:42.533
- Spartacus, you frightened me!
- I'm sorry.

1055
01:58:45.536 --> 01:58:48.623
- How long have you been there?
- A little while.

1056
01:58:49.916 --> 01:58:51.751
Why didn't you say something?

1057
01:58:51.834 --> 01:58:53.795
You seemed so happy.
I didn't want to bother you.

1058
01:58:53.878 --> 01:58:55.254
I am happy.

1059
01:58:56.547 --> 01:59:00.218
Spartacus, I've been trying to remember
the song that Antoninus sang.

1060
01:59:00.259 --> 01:59:05.264
Is it blue shadows and purple woods,
or is it purple woods and blue shadows?

1061
01:59:05.682 --> 01:59:08.685
- I want to make love to my wife!

1062
01:59:10.645 --> 01:59:13.690
- Spartacus, put me down. I'm dripping!
- I don't care.

1063
01:59:14.691 --> 01:59:16.859
- You've got, you've...
- Yes?

1064
01:59:17.568 --> 01:59:19.654
You have to be gentle with me.

1065
01:59:19.904 --> 01:59:22.031
Why? Why, darling?

1066
01:59:23.241 --> 01:59:26.119
I'm going to have a baby. Now put me down.

1067
01:59:29.038 --> 01:59:30.123
What?

1068
01:59:32.625 --> 01:59:33.835
A baby.

1069
01:59:38.756 --> 01:59:40.258
A baby? When?

1070
01:59:43.469 --> 01:59:44.971
In the spring.

1071
01:59:47.515 --> 01:59:50.560
Well, how? I mean, how do you know?

1072
01:59:51.102 --> 01:59:52.478
I know.

1073
01:59:53.521 --> 01:59:55.314
A baby in the spring.

1074
01:59:57.525 --> 02:00:00.361
- I'm gonna have a son.
- It might be a daughter.

1075
02:00:00.445 --> 02:00:02.447
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did.

1076
02:00:02.488 --> 02:00:05.116
You're cold. Here, get underneath this.

1077
02:00:06.325 --> 02:00:07.952
- Did I hurt you?
- No, you didn't.

1078
02:00:07.994 --> 02:00:11.289
- I didn't mean to be so rough.
- Why don't you kiss me?

1079
02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:14.459
This is the first time
I was ever going to have a baby.

1080
02:00:14.542 --> 02:00:15.877
Varinia.

1081
02:00:19.797 --> 02:00:21.007
A baby.

1082
02:00:22.008 --> 02:00:24.927
I'm just the same as I ever was, Spartacus.

1083
02:00:35.313 --> 02:00:36.814
I won't break.

1084
02:01:06.511 --> 02:01:11.099
<i>These slaves have already cost us</i>
<i>a thousand million sesterces.</i>

1085
02:01:11.182 --> 02:01:15.269
If now they want to relieve us
of their unwelcome presence,

1086
02:01:15.353 --> 02:01:17.438
- let them go!
- Impossible.

1087
02:01:17.522 --> 02:01:19.857
They've infected half of Italy
with this uprising.

1088
02:01:19.941 --> 02:01:21.943
If we permit them to escape,

1089
02:01:22.026 --> 02:01:25.029
this will spread
throughout the entire empire.

1090
02:01:30.743 --> 02:01:33.204
The Republic

1091
02:01:34.372 --> 02:01:37.458
is still weak from 20 years of civil strife.

1092
02:01:37.542 --> 02:01:40.044
We're engaged in two wars,

1093
02:01:40.545 --> 02:01:43.172
one in Spain and the other in Asia.

1094
02:01:44.006 --> 02:01:47.844
Pirates have cut off
our Egyptian grain supply,

1095
02:01:48.136 --> 02:01:52.014
and Spartacus raids the commerce
of all south Italy.

1096
02:01:52.890 --> 02:01:57.270
Half the precincts of Rome
are without bread!

1097
02:01:58.271 --> 02:02:00.398
The city is close to panic.

1098
02:02:02.233 --> 02:02:04.944
There are two things
we must do immediately!

1099
02:02:05.027 --> 02:02:08.823
Confirm Caesar
as permanent commander of the garrison

1100
02:02:10.533 --> 02:02:12.118
and...

1101
02:02:12.618 --> 02:02:15.121
And assign two legions

1102
02:02:15.204 --> 02:02:20.084
to intercept and destroy Spartacus
at the city of Metapontum!

1103
02:03:26.484 --> 02:03:29.320
If we could only have had
Batiatus in the other pot!

1104
02:03:29.362 --> 02:03:32.073
- Now you're talking!
- Ah, Varinia, wonderful meal.

1105
02:03:32.865 --> 02:03:33.866
Varinia.

1106
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:36.994
A small piece of land
with a few goats on it.

1107
02:03:37.078 --> 02:03:39.330
- Oh, no, no.
- I don't care.

1108
02:03:39.372 --> 02:03:40.873
The best wine in the world.

1109
02:03:40.957 --> 02:03:43.167
For wine,
you've got to go to Aquitania.

1110
02:03:46.462 --> 02:03:48.923
Come to Lidya for wine. That's the best.

1111
02:03:49.006 --> 02:03:50.841
The best wine comes from Greece.

1112
02:03:50.883 --> 02:03:53.094
Everybody knows that,
even the Romans!

1113
02:03:53.177 --> 02:03:54.845
No, Lidya!

1114
02:03:58.349 --> 02:03:59.433
You're all wrong!

1115
02:03:59.517 --> 02:04:01.727
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

1116
02:04:01.811 --> 02:04:03.104
I agree with you.

1117
02:04:25.376 --> 02:04:26.711
Gentlemen.

1118
02:04:27.795 --> 02:04:29.547
Any reports on Metapontum?

1119
02:04:29.630 --> 02:04:31.424
Heralds are crying the news now.

1120
02:04:31.507 --> 02:04:34.552
We lost 19,000 men,
including Commodius and his officers.

1121
02:04:34.593 --> 02:04:36.262
Nineteen thousand?

1122
02:04:38.889 --> 02:04:41.600
- Have you estates in Metapontum?
- No.

1123
02:04:42.143 --> 02:04:43.936
A son with Commodius.

1124
02:04:45.313 --> 02:04:47.606
With your permission, good day.

1125
02:04:50.067 --> 02:04:53.571
We take five years to train a legion.

1126
02:04:53.612 --> 02:04:57.867
How can this Spartacus train an army
in seven months?

1127
02:04:57.908 --> 02:05:00.745
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

1128
02:05:01.329 --> 02:05:04.457
- We should have an investigation.
- By all means, an investigation.

1129
02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:08.711
- Where is Spartacus now?
- He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.

1130
02:05:08.753 --> 02:05:11.547
I need a few moments
of the Commander's time.

1131
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:13.341
Will you excuse us?

1132
02:05:18.679 --> 02:05:23.100
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

1133
02:05:23.768 --> 02:05:25.811
Not a very splendid house.

1134
02:05:26.354 --> 02:05:29.106
And you feasted 11,000 plebeians
in the Field of Mars.

1135
02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:30.733
It scarcely could've been called a feast.

1136
02:05:32.443 --> 02:05:34.695
For 200 years,
your family and mine have been members

1137
02:05:34.779 --> 02:05:37.948
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party,

1138
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:39.950
servants and rulers of Rome.

1139
02:05:41.077 --> 02:05:43.621
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

1140
02:05:43.662 --> 02:05:46.207
I've left no one, least of all Rome.

1141
02:05:46.791 --> 02:05:50.836
But this much I've learned from Gracchus,
Rome is the mob.

1142
02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:51.962
No!

1143
02:05:52.797 --> 02:05:55.800
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

1144
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:59.095
I had no idea you'd grown religious.

1145
02:05:59.136 --> 02:06:01.222
That doesn't matter.

1146
02:06:01.305 --> 02:06:03.974
If there were no gods at all, I'd revere them.

1147
02:06:04.016 --> 02:06:07.478
If there were no Rome, I'd dream of her

1148
02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:09.313
as I want you to do.

1149
02:06:10.815 --> 02:06:13.609
I want you to come back to your own kind.

1150
02:06:13.901 --> 02:06:15.361
I beg you to.

1151
02:06:16.487 --> 02:06:19.323
Is it me you want, or is it the garrison?

1152
02:06:19.615 --> 02:06:21.325
Both.

1153
02:06:21.742 --> 02:06:23.327
Tell me frankly.

1154
02:06:23.411 --> 02:06:26.497
If you were I,
would you take the field against Spartacus?

1155
02:06:26.539 --> 02:06:28.165
- Of course.
- Why?

1156
02:06:28.416 --> 02:06:30.751
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

1157
02:06:30.835 --> 02:06:32.545
Ah, Caesar!

1158
02:06:33.045 --> 02:06:34.422
Which Rome?

1159
02:06:34.797 --> 02:06:36.006
Theirs

1160
02:06:36.757 --> 02:06:38.008
or ours?

1161
02:06:41.804 --> 02:06:44.098
You know Gracchus is my friend.

1162
02:06:46.058 --> 02:06:47.810
I won't betray him.

1163
02:06:49.728 --> 02:06:50.938
Caesar?

1164
02:06:55.067 --> 02:06:57.820
Which is worse?
To betray a friend or betray Rome herself?

1165
02:06:57.862 --> 02:07:00.114
My dear Crassus, I face no such choice.

1166
02:07:00.197 --> 02:07:02.700
You will, sooner than you think.

1167
02:07:04.618 --> 02:07:07.872
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you.

1168
02:07:08.122 --> 02:07:09.707
Your new master.

1169
02:07:12.585 --> 02:07:15.713
The Senate's been in session all day
over this business with Spartacus.

1170
02:07:15.754 --> 02:07:18.883
We've got eight legions
and no one to lead them.

1171
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:21.302
The minute you offer
the general's command,

1172
02:07:21.385 --> 02:07:23.971
they start wheezing like winded mules.

1173
02:07:24.054 --> 02:07:26.390
I've seen such epidemics before,
haven't you?

1174
02:07:26.474 --> 02:07:28.559
- How's your health?
- Excellent, as you very well know.

1175
02:07:28.642 --> 02:07:31.270
I take it the Senate's now offering
the command to me.

1176
02:07:31.353 --> 02:07:33.772
- You've been expecting it.
- I have.

1177
02:07:33.981 --> 02:07:36.692
Have you thought how costly
my services might be?

1178
02:07:36.734 --> 02:07:38.194
We buy everything else these days.

1179
02:07:38.235 --> 02:07:40.362
No reason why
we shouldn't be charged for patriotism.

1180
02:07:40.404 --> 02:07:42.031
What's your fee?

1181
02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:48.746
My election as First Consul,
command of all the legions of Italy,

1182
02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:52.958
and the abolition of
senatorial authority over the courts.

1183
02:07:53.083 --> 02:07:54.585
Dictatorship.

1184
02:07:55.794 --> 02:07:56.962
Order.

1185
02:07:59.089 --> 02:08:02.218
- Let me know if my terms are acceptable.
- I can tell you now. They're unacceptable.

1186
02:08:02.259 --> 02:08:03.928
Yes, yes, I know.

1187
02:08:04.011 --> 02:08:07.431
For the present, perhaps,
but times change and so does the Senate.

1188
02:08:07.515 --> 02:08:09.350
When that day comes, I shall be ready.

1189
02:08:09.433 --> 02:08:12.603
- Convey my respects to your wife.
- With pleasure.

1190
02:08:15.105 --> 02:08:16.899
He's right, you know.

1191
02:08:16.941 --> 02:08:19.652
If something isn't done about Spartacus,
the Senate will change.

1192
02:08:19.735 --> 02:08:24.615
And Crassus will save Rome from
the slave army by assuming dictatorship.

1193
02:08:27.326 --> 02:08:30.454
But that depends on which way
Spartacus jumps.

1194
02:08:30.496 --> 02:08:32.289
Just now he's trying to get out of Italy.

1195
02:08:32.373 --> 02:08:35.167
If he succeeds, the crisis is over

1196
02:08:35.251 --> 02:08:38.337
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

1197
02:08:38.796 --> 02:08:41.966
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

1198
02:08:42.007 --> 02:08:43.259
What?

1199
02:08:43.634 --> 02:08:46.470
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

1200
02:08:46.554 --> 02:08:48.597
I've assured them that we won't interfere

1201
02:08:48.639 --> 02:08:52.184
if they transport Spartacus and his slaves
out of Italy.

1202
02:08:53.978 --> 02:08:56.313
So now we deal with pirates.

1203
02:08:56.939 --> 02:08:58.691
We bargain with criminals.

1204
02:08:58.774 --> 02:09:02.987
Don't be so stiff-necked.
Politics is a practical profession.

1205
02:09:03.028 --> 02:09:06.657
If a criminal has what you want,
you do business with him.

1206
02:09:43.527 --> 02:09:45.863
How far are we from Brundusium?

1207
02:09:46.405 --> 02:09:47.948
About 20 miles.

1208
02:09:49.158 --> 02:09:52.870
Our army will camp here tonight.
They're six hours behind us.

1209
02:09:52.953 --> 02:09:57.166
Patullus, ride ahead to Brundusium.
Bring Tigranes here.

1210
02:09:57.207 --> 02:10:00.169
Marco, report back to Spartacus.

1211
02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:02.755
Tell him we camp tonight by the sea!

1212
02:10:44.588 --> 02:10:46.590
If all goes well,

1213
02:10:46.632 --> 02:10:48.801
we can load 150 ships a day.

1214
02:10:48.884 --> 02:10:51.762
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

1215
02:10:51.804 --> 02:10:55.766
- That ought to keep him busy.
- Saves me finding someplace to sleep.

1216
02:10:55.808 --> 02:10:59.812
- Crixus, keep giving me reports on Pompey.
- There won't be any surprises.

1217
02:10:59.895 --> 02:11:03.565
I still want patrols up to the time
we call them to board ship.

1218
02:11:03.607 --> 02:11:05.567
- I'll get them together.
- Spartacus,

1219
02:11:05.609 --> 02:11:08.570
the harbor district in Brundusium
has food warehouses,

1220
02:11:08.612 --> 02:11:11.198
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

1221
02:11:11.281 --> 02:11:15.035
- The countryside's filled with cattle.
- We've salt to preserve them.

1222
02:11:15.119 --> 02:11:16.453
I'll handle it.

1223
02:11:17.121 --> 02:11:20.958
Oh, find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

1224
02:11:21.041 --> 02:11:22.710
Tigranes Levantus.

1225
02:11:23.127 --> 02:11:24.461
Ah!

1226
02:11:25.713 --> 02:11:28.006
- My dear General.
- Welcome, Tigranes.

1227
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:32.594
No, no. You needn't look for litter bearers
to emancipate. I rode a horse.

1228
02:11:32.636 --> 02:11:35.764
Your gods, Isis and Serapis
must've been good to us.

1229
02:11:36.974 --> 02:11:40.310
The balance of the 50 million sesterces
we owe you.

1230
02:11:41.979 --> 02:11:43.480
General, I...

1231
02:11:44.189 --> 02:11:47.276
I bear a heavy burden of evil tidings.

1232
02:11:50.446 --> 02:11:51.822
What is it?

1233
02:11:53.657 --> 02:11:56.702
Pompey and his army has landed in Italy.

1234
02:11:57.161 --> 02:11:59.830
At the port of Rhegium three days ago.

1235
02:11:59.913 --> 02:12:02.166
We get complete reports
on their movements.

1236
02:12:02.249 --> 02:12:04.084
But do you also know

1237
02:12:04.168 --> 02:12:07.087
that a Roman fleet
carrying Lucullus and his army

1238
02:12:07.171 --> 02:12:09.506
arrives tomorrow at Brundusium?

1239
02:12:11.925 --> 02:12:14.887
- Lucullus, here?
- You have no ships.

1240
02:12:18.807 --> 02:12:20.851
I saw them in the harbor.

1241
02:12:22.436 --> 02:12:26.231
The Cilician fleet, out of strategic necessity,

1242
02:12:26.315 --> 02:12:29.026
has been obliged to withdraw.

1243
02:12:30.235 --> 02:12:33.405
- Withdraw?
- There are no ships at all?

1244
02:12:41.914 --> 02:12:45.751
Cilician pirates can destroy any Roman fleet
that ever sailed.

1245
02:12:46.543 --> 02:12:49.087
If they run away now,
it's not because they're afraid!

1246
02:12:49.171 --> 02:12:50.506
You better give me a better reason.

1247
02:12:50.547 --> 02:12:52.674
I'm as desolated as you are, General.

1248
02:12:52.716 --> 02:12:54.384
Stand up. Up!

1249
02:12:56.053 --> 02:12:57.554
On your toes.

1250
02:13:01.558 --> 02:13:03.018
You'll cut the skin.

1251
02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:05.395
Why did the Cilicians run away?

1252
02:13:05.687 --> 02:13:07.231
They were paid.

1253
02:13:08.106 --> 02:13:11.026
And who paid them? Who?

1254
02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:13.362
Crassus.

1255
02:13:17.074 --> 02:13:18.325
Crassus.

1256
02:13:19.576 --> 02:13:21.870
Crassus won't fight us himself.

1257
02:13:22.162 --> 02:13:25.123
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

1258
02:13:25.499 --> 02:13:28.669
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

1259
02:13:28.752 --> 02:13:29.920
I don't know.

1260
02:13:30.003 --> 02:13:34.174
How can I answer, when there is no answer?
I've been betrayed just as you have.

1261
02:13:34.258 --> 02:13:35.968
There is an answer.

1262
02:13:37.219 --> 02:13:39.847
There must be an answer to everything.

1263
02:13:41.181 --> 02:13:43.267
Five miles from Brundusium.

1264
02:13:45.435 --> 02:13:46.979
Here's Rhegium.

1265
02:13:48.188 --> 02:13:51.358
Pompey's march
must've brought him to about here.

1266
02:13:51.441 --> 02:13:54.069
He's four days away, maybe more.

1267
02:13:55.779 --> 02:13:58.448
Lucullus lands at Brundusium tomorrow.

1268
02:13:58.991 --> 02:14:01.118
If we engage Lucullus,

1269
02:14:01.201 --> 02:14:04.288
Pompey will have time
to march against our rear.

1270
02:14:05.789 --> 02:14:08.125
If we turn west to meet Pompey,

1271
02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:12.546
Lucullus will march against our rear.

1272
02:14:13.881 --> 02:14:18.218
The only other army in all of Italy is here.

1273
02:14:18.594 --> 02:14:19.678
Rome.

1274
02:14:20.846 --> 02:14:22.514
Yes, of course!

1275
02:14:23.015 --> 02:14:25.893
Crassus is inviting us to march on Rome,

1276
02:14:25.976 --> 02:14:28.270
so he can take the field against us.

1277
02:14:28.770 --> 02:14:31.648
- Crassus wants us to march on Rome?
- He's forcing us to.

1278
02:14:31.690 --> 02:14:36.403
He knows I won't let myself be trapped
between two armies with my back to the sea.

1279
02:14:36.486 --> 02:14:39.114
He knows my only other choice is Rome.

1280
02:14:40.657 --> 02:14:42.868
Somewhere on the way, we meet.

1281
02:14:43.535 --> 02:14:46.538
If he beats us,
he becomes the savior of Rome,

1282
02:14:46.622 --> 02:14:48.832
and there's his final victory over the Senate.

1283
02:14:48.916 --> 02:14:53.503
General, allow me
to redeem myself in your eyes.

1284
02:14:54.254 --> 02:14:55.505
For a small commission,

1285
02:14:55.589 --> 02:15:00.552
I can arrange for you, your family
and your leaders, of course,

1286
02:15:00.636 --> 02:15:03.847
to be smuggled out of Italy and transported
to one of the eastern countries

1287
02:15:03.931 --> 02:15:06.725
where men like you are welcome
and appreciated.

1288
02:15:06.808 --> 02:15:09.686
You can live like kings
for the rest of your lives.

1289
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:11.855
What do you think, General?

1290
02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:13.440
Go away.

1291
02:15:15.233 --> 02:15:16.485
Go away?

1292
02:15:20.072 --> 02:15:21.323
Go away.

1293
02:15:30.374 --> 02:15:32.918
Tell the trumpeters to sound assembly.

1294
02:15:40.884 --> 02:15:44.888
Tonight, a Roman army lands
in the harbor of Brundusium.

1295
02:15:46.139 --> 02:15:49.059
Another army is approaching us
from the west.

1296
02:15:49.309 --> 02:15:53.563
Between them, they hope to trap us here,
against the sea.

1297
02:15:54.022 --> 02:15:57.734
The Cilician pirates have betrayed us.
We have no ships.

1298
02:15:57.859 --> 02:16:00.362
"By order of the Senate,

1299
02:16:01.071 --> 02:16:04.741
"be it known that we have this day elected

1300
02:16:04.783 --> 02:16:07.577
"Marcus Licinius Crassus

1301
02:16:08.161 --> 02:16:10.539
"First Consul of the Republic

1302
02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:14.793
"and Commander-in-Chief
of the armies of Rome."

1303
02:16:15.210 --> 02:16:17.629
Hail Crassus!

1304
02:16:18.296 --> 02:16:22.050
Rome will not allow us to escape from Italy.

1305
02:16:23.677 --> 02:16:26.930
We have no choice
but to march against Rome herself

1306
02:16:27.723 --> 02:16:30.934
and end this war
the only way it could have ended.

1307
02:16:31.601 --> 02:16:35.188
By freeing every slave in Italy.

1308
02:16:35.564 --> 02:16:39.192
I promise you a new Rome,

1309
02:16:40.235 --> 02:16:42.696
a new Italy and a new empire.

1310
02:16:43.363 --> 02:16:46.867
I promise the destruction of the slave army

1311
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:51.913
and the restoration of order
throughout all our territories.

1312
02:16:52.456 --> 02:16:56.043
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers,

1313
02:16:56.626 --> 02:16:59.588
facing a long march and a hard fight,

1314
02:16:59.671 --> 02:17:02.924
than to be the richest citizen of Rome,

1315
02:17:03.341 --> 02:17:05.969
fat with food he didn't work for,

1316
02:17:06.553 --> 02:17:08.472
and surrounded by slaves.

1317
02:17:08.805 --> 02:17:11.475
I promise the living body of Spartacus

1318
02:17:12.142 --> 02:17:14.978
for whatever punishment you may deem fit.

1319
02:17:15.645 --> 02:17:18.148
That, or his head.

1320
02:17:19.941 --> 02:17:23.320
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

1321
02:17:24.529 --> 02:17:26.323
This I have sworn

1322
02:17:27.324 --> 02:17:29.993
in the temple that guards their bones.

1323
02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:33.872
Hail Crassus!

1324
02:17:34.289 --> 02:17:36.583
We've traveled a long ways together.

1325
02:17:37.334 --> 02:17:41.505
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

1326
02:17:42.255 --> 02:17:46.176
Now instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea,

1327
02:17:47.052 --> 02:17:49.179
we must fight again.

1328
02:17:50.305 --> 02:17:54.893
Maybe there's no peace in this world,
for us or for anyone else.

1329
02:17:54.976 --> 02:17:56.353
I don't know.

1330
02:17:57.395 --> 02:18:01.358
But I do know that as long as we live,

1331
02:18:02.067 --> 02:18:04.528
we must stay true to ourselves.

1332
02:18:06.655 --> 02:18:08.865
I do know that we're brothers.

1333
02:18:09.741 --> 02:18:11.868
And I know that we're free.

1334
02:18:19.084 --> 02:18:20.377
We march tonight!

1335
02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:56.306
- Hail Crassus!
- Hail Crassus!

1336
02:19:57.307 --> 02:19:59.184
Greetings to you, Crassus.

1337
02:19:59.267 --> 02:20:01.811
Caius. Gentlemen.

1338
02:20:03.188 --> 02:20:04.981
Have your dispositions been made?

1339
02:20:05.023 --> 02:20:09.194
Each maniple knows its position, sir,
and exactly what's expected.

1340
02:20:09.653 --> 02:20:13.156
Every legion commander
has been given his battle orders.

1341
02:20:13.615 --> 02:20:16.326
Excellent.
All positions will now be changed.

1342
02:20:16.409 --> 02:20:17.661
Changed?

1343
02:20:18.495 --> 02:20:22.123
Spartacus takes too keen an interest
in our plans, I fear.

1344
02:20:22.958 --> 02:20:26.169
New battle orders will be issued
in a short while.

1345
02:20:29.005 --> 02:20:32.968
Spartacus has every reason to believe
that he has outdistanced

1346
02:20:33.009 --> 02:20:35.845
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and Lucullus.

1347
02:20:36.638 --> 02:20:41.559
However, there are passes through the
Apennine Mountains unknown to any map.

1348
02:20:43.687 --> 02:20:47.399
It may fortify your courage to know

1349
02:20:48.066 --> 02:20:51.695
that Pompey is encamped
some 20 miles to the west

1350
02:20:52.362 --> 02:20:55.323
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south

1351
02:20:55.365 --> 02:20:57.367
by forced night march.

1352
02:20:57.409 --> 02:21:01.621
Sir, allow us to pledge you
the most glorious victory of your career.

1353
02:21:01.705 --> 02:21:02.747
- Aye!
- Aye!

1354
02:21:03.623 --> 02:21:05.417
I'm not after glory!

1355
02:21:06.626 --> 02:21:08.378
I'm after Spartacus.

1356
02:21:09.713 --> 02:21:12.215
And, gentlemen, I mean to have him.

1357
02:21:13.717 --> 02:21:17.137
However, this campaign is not alone
to kill Spartacus.

1358
02:21:18.179 --> 02:21:20.807
It is to kill the legend of Spartacus.

1359
02:21:23.226 --> 02:21:25.020
You may go, gentlemen.

1360
02:21:25.061 --> 02:21:27.230
- Hail Crassus.
- Hail Crassus.

1361
02:21:29.858 --> 02:21:32.068
Lentulus Batiatus awaits Your Excellency.

1362
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:34.112
- Who?
- The lanista, sir.

1363
02:21:34.779 --> 02:21:36.865
Ah! Admit him.

1364
02:21:40.201 --> 02:21:41.453
Most Blessed Highness,

1365
02:21:41.536 --> 02:21:44.956
as soon as I received your message
I hurried into your distinguished presence.

1366
02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:48.084
I'm glad you were able to spare the time.
Sit down.

1367
02:21:48.168 --> 02:21:50.211
Oh, how gracious.

1368
02:21:51.713 --> 02:21:54.090
I understand... I'm informed

1369
02:21:54.883 --> 02:21:57.260
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

1370
02:21:57.302 --> 02:21:58.386
Yes!

1371
02:21:58.428 --> 02:22:02.349
In fact, if it isn't too subversive to say so,

1372
02:22:02.432 --> 02:22:04.893
I made him what he is today.

1373
02:22:05.518 --> 02:22:07.604
You're to be congratulated.

1374
02:22:08.021 --> 02:22:11.274
You're so admirably qualified

1375
02:22:11.816 --> 02:22:14.736
to give me what up to now
I've not been able to obtain,

1376
02:22:14.778 --> 02:22:16.738
a physical description of Spartacus.

1377
02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:18.031
Oh, yes.

1378
02:22:19.908 --> 02:22:21.493
But you saw him.

1379
02:22:22.577 --> 02:22:24.287
- What?
- In the ring.

1380
02:22:26.122 --> 02:22:27.207
When?

1381
02:22:27.957 --> 02:22:31.586
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

1382
02:22:33.505 --> 02:22:34.631
What?

1383
02:22:35.632 --> 02:22:37.926
I trust they're both in good health.

1384
02:22:37.967 --> 02:22:41.096
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the negro.

1385
02:22:41.137 --> 02:22:42.597
I remember the negro.

1386
02:22:42.639 --> 02:22:46.267
You had good cause to. If I... If I may say so,

1387
02:22:46.810 --> 02:22:49.437
a brilliant dagger thrust, difficult angle.

1388
02:22:49.479 --> 02:22:51.898
- Spartacus was the opponent?
- Yes.

1389
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:55.985
What did he look like?

1390
02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:59.364
That's a matter of some importance
to Your Highness?

1391
02:22:59.447 --> 02:23:03.284
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

1392
02:23:04.536 --> 02:23:08.331
We're both Roman patriots.
You're a great one. I, of course, smaller.

1393
02:23:08.373 --> 02:23:10.959
We both believe in Roman fair play.

1394
02:23:11.751 --> 02:23:13.002
You want something from me.

1395
02:23:13.086 --> 02:23:16.631
I would be lacking
in respect for my conscience,

1396
02:23:16.673 --> 02:23:18.925
if I did not say
that I wish something from you.

1397
02:23:19.008 --> 02:23:20.343
Name your price.

1398
02:23:21.302 --> 02:23:23.138
If... No.

1399
02:23:23.555 --> 02:23:26.182
When you win your victory tomorrow,

1400
02:23:26.641 --> 02:23:29.102
presumably the survivors will be
auctioned off

1401
02:23:29.185 --> 02:23:32.856
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

1402
02:23:33.773 --> 02:23:36.192
Could not the agent for that sale

1403
02:23:36.234 --> 02:23:40.447
be he who shares this tiny moment
of history with Your Honor?

1404
02:23:42.699 --> 02:23:46.536
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

1405
02:23:47.203 --> 02:23:49.914
In return, you will remain here

1406
02:23:49.998 --> 02:23:52.667
until after the battle and aid me
in identifying Spartacus.

1407
02:23:52.709 --> 02:23:54.252
After the battle?

1408
02:23:54.335 --> 02:23:56.921
You misunderstand me. I'm a civilian.

1409
02:23:57.213 --> 02:24:00.675
I'm even more of a civilian
than most civilians.

1410
02:24:01.426 --> 02:24:03.219
If you wish to remain so,

1411
02:24:03.303 --> 02:24:07.807
I strongly advise you to stay here
and be our guest. Guard!

1412
02:24:10.935 --> 02:24:12.479
Hmm?

1413
02:24:13.813 --> 02:24:18.443
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus,

1414
02:24:19.569 --> 02:24:23.823
what if it is Spartacus who crosses
the battlefield looking for you?

1415
02:24:26.159 --> 02:24:30.538
In such circumstances,
I have no doubt you will be helping him.

1416
02:24:31.831 --> 02:24:34.792
This fellow remains with us
until after the battle.

1417
02:24:34.876 --> 02:24:38.171
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.

1418
02:26:11.514 --> 02:26:13.933
Mommy? Mommy?

1419
02:26:16.894 --> 02:26:18.938
When do we go home?

1420
02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:25.528
Go to sleep, dear.

1421
02:26:59.646 --> 02:27:01.105
No pains yet?

1422
02:27:01.648 --> 02:27:04.359
He's a bad child. He hits me with his fists.

1423
02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:07.403
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?

1424
02:27:07.737 --> 02:27:09.364
Can you feel it?

1425
02:27:11.115 --> 02:27:12.533
No, I don't.

1426
02:27:13.076 --> 02:27:15.578
I hope he waits till we get to Rome.

1427
02:27:19.457 --> 02:27:20.583
Rome.

1428
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:24.837
They've never beaten us yet.

1429
02:27:27.423 --> 02:27:28.424
No.

1430
02:27:31.344 --> 02:27:32.970
But no matter how many times
we beat them,

1431
02:27:33.054 --> 02:27:37.183
they still seem to have another army
to send against us.

1432
02:27:38.267 --> 02:27:39.644
And another.

1433
02:27:42.772 --> 02:27:46.067
Varinia, it just seems like
we've started something

1434
02:27:47.819 --> 02:27:49.612
that has no ending.

1435
02:27:49.654 --> 02:27:52.782
If it ended tomorrow, it would be worth it.

1436
02:27:58.496 --> 02:27:59.914
Oh, Varinia,

1437
02:28:02.333 --> 02:28:04.085
don't make me weak.

1438
02:28:05.044 --> 02:28:07.380
You're strong enough to be weak.

1439
02:28:08.256 --> 02:28:09.632
Oh, Varinia.

1440
02:28:10.967 --> 02:28:12.343
Oh, Varinia,

1441
02:28:12.885 --> 02:28:15.096
I love you more than my life.

1442
02:28:17.348 --> 02:28:20.893
Yet, sometimes,
even with you sleeping beside me

1443
02:28:23.229 --> 02:28:24.814
I feel so alone.

1444
02:28:26.983 --> 02:28:31.320
I imagine a god for slaves and I pray.

1445
02:28:33.156 --> 02:28:34.949
What do you pray for?

1446
02:28:36.993 --> 02:28:39.620
I pray for a son who'll be born free.

1447
02:28:41.497 --> 02:28:43.541
I pray for the same thing.

1448
02:28:48.838 --> 02:28:51.007
Take care of my son, Varinia.

1449
02:28:52.508 --> 02:28:54.427
And if he never knows me,

1450
02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:57.805
tell him who I was and what we dreamed of.

1451
02:28:58.848 --> 02:29:01.726
Tell him the truth.
There will be others to tell him lies.

1452
02:29:01.809 --> 02:29:03.978
I can't live without you, Spartacus.

1453
02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:06.856
Varinia, Varinia.

1454
02:29:08.483 --> 02:29:09.734
Varinia.

1455
02:29:14.864 --> 02:29:19.410
Varinia, for you and me
there can be no farewells.

1456
02:29:24.707 --> 02:29:28.544
As long as one of us lives, we all live.

1457
02:29:30.463 --> 02:29:34.425
- I felt it. Did you feel it?
- Yes, I did.

1458
02:29:34.509 --> 02:29:37.553
- That was so strong. Does it hurt you?
- No.

1459
02:29:37.637 --> 02:29:39.388
That was so strong.

1460
02:29:41.557 --> 02:29:44.393
Oh, Varinia, Varinia, Varinia.

1461
02:36:01.061 --> 02:36:03.272
Lucullus and Pompey.

1462
02:39:42.199 --> 02:39:44.243
Have we a count of prisoners?

1463
02:39:44.326 --> 02:39:46.912
We haven't made the final count, sir.

1464
02:39:46.995 --> 02:39:50.332
I bring a message from your master,

1465
02:39:50.416 --> 02:39:53.836
Marcus Licinius Crassus,

1466
02:39:53.877 --> 02:39:55.712
Commander of Italy.

1467
02:39:56.213 --> 02:40:00.092
By command
of His Most Merciful Excellency,

1468
02:40:00.175 --> 02:40:02.719
your lives are to be spared.

1469
02:40:06.014 --> 02:40:10.018
Slaves you were and slaves you remain.

1470
02:40:10.519 --> 02:40:15.357
But the terrible penalty of crucifixion
has been set aside

1471
02:40:15.816 --> 02:40:20.195
on the single condition
that you identify the body

1472
02:40:20.279 --> 02:40:24.741
or the living person of the slave
called Spartacus.

1473
02:40:37.463 --> 02:40:40.215
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

1474
02:40:41.884 --> 02:40:43.510
I'm Spartacus.

1475
02:40:43.719 --> 02:40:46.555
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

1476
02:40:46.638 --> 02:40:48.098
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

1477
02:40:48.182 --> 02:40:50.392
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

1478
02:40:50.476 --> 02:40:52.561
I'm Spartacus!

1479
02:40:59.067 --> 02:41:01.195
I'm Spartacus.

1480
02:41:02.946 --> 02:41:04.531
I'm Spartacus.

1481
02:41:25.052 --> 02:41:28.555
Forgive me for being one of the last
to congratulate you.

1482
02:41:28.597 --> 02:41:31.099
There's an ugly rumor going round the camp

1483
02:41:31.183 --> 02:41:34.102
that the prisoners are to be crucified.

1484
02:41:35.521 --> 02:41:36.980
That is true.

1485
02:41:37.814 --> 02:41:40.234
Perhaps this is the moment
to remind Your Highness

1486
02:41:40.275 --> 02:41:43.779
that you promised me
I could be the agent in their auctioning.

1487
02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:47.282
You promised Spartacus to me!
Where is he?

1488
02:41:47.783 --> 02:41:51.453
In return, I promised you the sale of
the survivors and there will be none!

1489
02:42:16.311 --> 02:42:17.938
But it's Varinia.

1490
02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:21.066
Yes, I remember.
You're the woman of Spartacus?

1491
02:42:21.858 --> 02:42:23.318
I'm his wife.

1492
02:42:24.236 --> 02:42:26.113
And this is his child?

1493
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:29.074
Yes.

1494
02:42:30.158 --> 02:42:31.910
Where is Spartacus?

1495
02:42:36.164 --> 02:42:37.291
Dead.

1496
02:42:38.709 --> 02:42:40.669
Did you see him killed?

1497
02:42:44.756 --> 02:42:46.008
Yes.

1498
02:42:47.801 --> 02:42:49.261
You're lying.

1499
02:42:50.470 --> 02:42:51.888
Where is he?

1500
02:42:54.933 --> 02:42:56.018
Hmm?

1501
02:42:56.351 --> 02:42:58.812
At least here is someone worth selling,
Your Enormity.

1502
02:42:58.854 --> 02:43:01.690
I'll even take the child as an investment.

1503
02:43:02.858 --> 02:43:05.360
- How many women have been taken?
- Under 40, sir.

1504
02:43:05.444 --> 02:43:08.530
Those who weren't killed have run off
to the hills with their children.

1505
02:43:08.614 --> 02:43:10.824
You may sell all the others
but not this woman.

1506
02:43:10.866 --> 02:43:14.578
You haven't seen the others.
They're of surpassing ugliness!

1507
02:43:14.661 --> 02:43:16.204
A genius wouldn't be able to sell them.

1508
02:43:16.246 --> 02:43:18.999
Flog that scoundrel out of camp.

1509
02:43:19.207 --> 02:43:22.794
This woman and her child
are to be conveyed to my house in Rome.

1510
02:43:36.725 --> 02:43:38.602
- Halt them!
- Halt!

1511
02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:45.275
Antoninus?

1512
02:44:03.251 --> 02:44:04.461
Tribune!

1513
02:44:10.217 --> 02:44:13.512
Slaves are to be crucified
along the roadside

1514
02:44:13.637 --> 02:44:17.432
the full distance between here
and the gates of Rome.

1515
02:44:21.770 --> 02:44:23.897
Hold this man till the end.

1516
02:44:27.359 --> 02:44:29.027
And that man, too.

1517
02:44:35.784 --> 02:44:37.661
- March on.
- March on!

1518
02:45:31.757 --> 02:45:34.426
I've more stripes than a zebra.

1519
02:45:34.676 --> 02:45:39.765
Every time I touch my wounds,
they sing like larks.

1520
02:45:41.183 --> 02:45:45.395
But in spite of that, I found something
I never had before, with all my wealth.

1521
02:45:45.479 --> 02:45:46.730
What is that?

1522
02:45:47.522 --> 02:45:50.692
Don't laugh at me,
but I believe it to be dignity.

1523
02:45:51.026 --> 02:45:55.238
In Rome, dignity shortens life
even more surely than disease.

1524
02:45:55.572 --> 02:45:58.825
The gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise.

1525
02:45:58.867 --> 02:46:00.368
You think so?

1526
02:46:00.786 --> 02:46:04.581
Anyone who believes
I'll turn informer for nothing is a fool.

1527
02:46:05.332 --> 02:46:07.876
I bore the whip without complaint.

1528
02:46:07.959 --> 02:46:11.505
Indeed, that sounds like
a bad attack of dignity.

1529
02:46:11.963 --> 02:46:14.549
I hope this will not deflect you

1530
02:46:14.591 --> 02:46:16.843
from the revenge
you were going to take on Crassus.

1531
02:46:16.885 --> 02:46:19.471
On the contrary,
it only strengthens my resolve.

1532
02:46:19.554 --> 02:46:22.224
- That's enough.
- I'm glad to learn that.

1533
02:46:24.476 --> 02:46:28.271
This woman, Varinia, is in his house.
All Rome knows about it.

1534
02:46:28.355 --> 02:46:32.984
Malicious tongues even say
that he's in love for the first time.

1535
02:46:33.777 --> 02:46:35.737
Yes! Oh!

1536
02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:40.700
I noticed a strange look in his eye
when he first saw her.

1537
02:46:40.909 --> 02:46:45.789
It would take a great woman to make
Crassus fall out of love with himself.

1538
02:46:46.414 --> 02:46:47.958
I'll be honest with you.

1539
02:46:48.041 --> 02:46:51.503
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

1540
02:46:51.586 --> 02:46:54.923
Dignity and honesty in one afternoon.
I hardly recognize you.

1541
02:46:56.091 --> 02:46:57.801
But she is an impossible woman.

1542
02:46:57.884 --> 02:47:01.096
- Beautiful?
- Beautiful? Well, beautiful.

1543
02:47:01.388 --> 02:47:04.182
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

1544
02:47:04.266 --> 02:47:06.268
- Proud?
- Proud, proud.

1545
02:47:06.351 --> 02:47:11.273
You feel that she would surrender
to the right man which is irritating.

1546
02:47:12.274 --> 02:47:14.484
I like Crassus.

1547
02:47:14.568 --> 02:47:18.572
Let's save him from his agony.
Let's steal this woman.

1548
02:47:19.656 --> 02:47:22.075
Steal the woman? Why?

1549
02:47:22.117 --> 02:47:24.536
I can no longer hurt Crassus in the Senate

1550
02:47:24.619 --> 02:47:28.331
but I can hurt him
where he'll feel it most, in his pride.

1551
02:47:28.415 --> 02:47:30.584
Attack our enemy from within.

1552
02:47:30.625 --> 02:47:33.378
The scheme is excellent,
but I hope you're not suggesting

1553
02:47:33.461 --> 02:47:36.798
- that I steal the woman.
- Yes!

1554
02:47:38.049 --> 02:47:41.219
Buy some horses and a cart with a canopy.

1555
02:47:41.303 --> 02:47:43.430
Bring her here by nightfall.

1556
02:47:43.638 --> 02:47:44.973
Oh, no.

1557
02:47:45.223 --> 02:47:48.852
Add courage to your newfound virtues.

1558
02:47:51.062 --> 02:47:54.816
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

1559
02:47:57.152 --> 02:47:59.321
Half a million? Mmm-hmm.

1560
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:04.451
Well, Crassus

1561
02:48:04.492 --> 02:48:08.038
does seem to dwindle in the mind, but...

1562
02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:11.666
Let's reduce him further. A round million!

1563
02:48:12.334 --> 02:48:13.668
A million.

1564
02:48:14.544 --> 02:48:17.547
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

1565
02:48:18.006 --> 02:48:19.549
With a lesser sum, I have.

1566
02:48:26.765 --> 02:48:31.019
Forgive the intrusion.
I'm not in the habit of coming uninvited.

1567
02:48:31.102 --> 02:48:34.397
- You've always been welcome here.
- As a pupil.

1568
02:48:39.361 --> 02:48:42.280
- You're not alone.
- No.

1569
02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:46.034
This time you've come to teach.

1570
02:48:48.370 --> 02:48:50.246
You've joined Crassus?

1571
02:48:51.373 --> 02:48:53.375
- Am I arrested?
- No.

1572
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:57.545
But I must ask you to come with me
to the Senate immediately.

1573
02:48:58.797 --> 02:49:03.218
What I do, I do not for myself but for Rome.

1574
02:49:03.259 --> 02:49:06.554
Rome? Poor, helpless Rome.

1575
02:49:07.430 --> 02:49:11.434
Let's go and hear more about Rome
from Crassus.

1576
02:49:16.690 --> 02:49:19.109
Did you truly believe 500 years of Rome

1577
02:49:19.192 --> 02:49:22.737
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

1578
02:49:26.282 --> 02:49:30.370
Already the bodies of 6,000 crucified slaves

1579
02:49:30.412 --> 02:49:32.205
line the Appian Way.

1580
02:49:32.831 --> 02:49:35.792
Tomorrow the last of their companions
will fight to the death

1581
02:49:35.875 --> 02:49:39.379
in the temple of my fathers,
as a sacrifice to them.

1582
02:49:39.921 --> 02:49:43.633
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble

1583
02:49:43.717 --> 02:49:48.596
if they falter one instant in loyalty
to the new order.

1584
02:49:49.389 --> 02:49:51.641
The enemies of the state are known.

1585
02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:55.854
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

1586
02:49:56.271 --> 02:50:00.066
In every city and province,
lists of the disloyal have been compiled.

1587
02:50:00.859 --> 02:50:05.447
Tomorrow they will learn the cost
of their terrible folly,

1588
02:50:07.115 --> 02:50:08.616
their treason.

1589
02:50:09.617 --> 02:50:13.997
Where does my name appear on the list
of disloyal enemies of the state?

1590
02:50:15.123 --> 02:50:16.291
First.

1591
02:50:18.668 --> 02:50:22.088
Yet, upon you
I have no desire for vengeance.

1592
02:50:23.131 --> 02:50:25.633
Your property shall not be touched.

1593
02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:29.095
You will retain the rank and title
of Roman senator.

1594
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:30.638
A house...

1595
02:50:31.598 --> 02:50:35.143
A farmhouse in Picenum
has been provided for your exile.

1596
02:50:35.852 --> 02:50:38.271
You may take your women with you.

1597
02:50:39.647 --> 02:50:43.818
Why am I to be left so conspicuously alive?

1598
02:50:44.611 --> 02:50:47.655
Your followers are deluded enough
to trust you.

1599
02:50:47.739 --> 02:50:51.493
I intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for the sake of their own good,

1600
02:50:51.576 --> 02:50:54.579
their peaceful and profitable future.

1601
02:50:55.163 --> 02:50:58.666
From time to time thereafter, I may
find it useful to bring you back to Rome

1602
02:50:58.750 --> 02:51:00.835
to continue your duty to her,

1603
02:51:00.877 --> 02:51:05.256
to calm the envious spirit
and the troubled mind.

1604
02:51:05.924 --> 02:51:10.845
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order,

1605
02:51:11.262 --> 02:51:13.515
and trust the gods!

1606
02:51:17.644 --> 02:51:19.020
You may go.

1607
02:51:30.490 --> 02:51:31.908
Halt!

1608
02:52:18.246 --> 02:52:20.582
Why hide behind that stola?

1609
02:52:26.421 --> 02:52:27.922
That's better.

1610
02:52:28.464 --> 02:52:31.426
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

1611
02:52:32.010 --> 02:52:36.472
You, above all people, should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly.

1612
02:52:36.556 --> 02:52:37.891
Come here.

1613
02:52:52.822 --> 02:52:57.285
This belonged to a queen,
the Queen of Persia.

1614
02:52:58.953 --> 02:53:00.288
It's heavy.

1615
02:53:02.624 --> 02:53:05.335
In time you will wear it lightly enough.

1616
02:53:18.473 --> 02:53:19.724
Sit down.

1617
02:53:23.353 --> 02:53:26.522
Will you have some squab and honey?

1618
02:53:28.024 --> 02:53:29.192
No.

1619
02:53:29.817 --> 02:53:31.152
You'll enjoy it.

1620
02:53:32.946 --> 02:53:34.739
And a piece of melon?

1621
02:53:39.369 --> 02:53:41.371
And some wine, of course.

1622
02:53:43.331 --> 02:53:44.457
Eat.

1623
02:53:50.505 --> 02:53:54.133
I did not command you to eat, I invited you.

1624
02:53:56.344 --> 02:54:00.723
You find the richness of your surroundings
makes conversation difficult?

1625
02:54:01.307 --> 02:54:02.350
Hmm?

1626
02:54:03.685 --> 02:54:05.186
Why am I here?

1627
02:54:09.107 --> 02:54:10.608
Good question.

1628
02:54:11.609 --> 02:54:13.361
A woman's question.

1629
02:54:14.529 --> 02:54:18.032
I wish the answer could be as good
and straightforward.

1630
02:54:20.910 --> 02:54:23.705
Mmm. The infant, it thrives?

1631
02:54:24.872 --> 02:54:26.040
He thrives.

1632
02:54:26.082 --> 02:54:30.712
I purchased a wet nurse for him, yesterday.
I hope the milk agrees with him.

1633
02:54:33.381 --> 02:54:34.966
I sent her away.

1634
02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:38.303
I prefer to nurse the child myself.

1635
02:54:39.387 --> 02:54:41.264
I'm not sure I approve.

1636
02:54:42.932 --> 02:54:45.059
It ties you to the old life.

1637
02:54:46.102 --> 02:54:49.188
I want you to begin
to look forward to the new.

1638
02:54:51.941 --> 02:54:54.485
I don't care about my new life here.

1639
02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:58.489
You care about the life of your child,
don't you?

1640
02:54:59.490 --> 02:55:02.035
Why do you threaten me with my baby?

1641
02:55:02.618 --> 02:55:05.580
I belong to you.
You can take me anytime you wish.

1642
02:55:05.663 --> 02:55:08.333
But I don't want to take you.

1643
02:55:09.584 --> 02:55:11.294
I want you to give.

1644
02:55:14.172 --> 02:55:16.215
I want your love, Varinia.

1645
02:55:19.761 --> 02:55:23.890
You think by threatening to kill my child
you'll make me love you?

1646
02:55:24.182 --> 02:55:27.268
I did not threaten to kill your child.

1647
02:55:34.484 --> 02:55:37.445
I'm sorry, Varinia.

1648
02:55:44.077 --> 02:55:46.287
One shouldn't grieve forever.

1649
02:55:47.455 --> 02:55:50.500
I'm not grieving, I'm remembering.

1650
02:55:51.501 --> 02:55:53.961
Do I interfere with your memories?

1651
02:55:55.296 --> 02:55:56.506
Oh, no.

1652
02:55:59.425 --> 02:56:04.180
You tread the ridge between truth and insult
with the skill of a mountain goat.

1653
02:56:04.597 --> 02:56:05.681
Well.

1654
02:56:08.059 --> 02:56:11.437
What do you remember,
when you think about Spartacus?

1655
02:56:13.898 --> 02:56:17.151
- It doesn't distress you to talk about him?
- No.

1656
02:56:19.237 --> 02:56:20.613
Well, then,

1657
02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:27.036
what sort of a man was he, really?

1658
02:56:32.250 --> 02:56:36.421
He was a man who began all alone,
like an animal.

1659
02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:39.382
Yet on the day he died,

1660
02:56:39.465 --> 02:56:43.177
thousands and thousands
would gladly have died in his place.

1661
02:56:45.012 --> 02:56:47.682
What was he? Was he a god?

1662
02:56:49.183 --> 02:56:50.810
He wasn't a god.

1663
02:56:52.019 --> 02:56:55.565
He was a simple man. A slave.

1664
02:56:59.694 --> 02:57:01.070
I loved him.

1665
02:57:01.779 --> 02:57:04.240
He was an outlaw! A murderer!

1666
02:57:04.323 --> 02:57:08.035
An enemy to everything fine and decent
that Rome ever built!

1667
02:57:08.995 --> 02:57:10.872
Damn you! You tell me.

1668
02:57:11.747 --> 02:57:14.500
- Why did you love him?
- I can't tell you.

1669
02:57:15.168 --> 02:57:18.337
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

1670
02:57:19.714 --> 02:57:22.258
But I want to understand.

1671
02:57:23.217 --> 02:57:27.013
Don't you see? I must understand.

1672
02:57:35.855 --> 02:57:38.232
You're afraid of him, aren't you?

1673
02:57:42.612 --> 02:57:44.739
That's why you want his wife,

1674
02:57:45.406 --> 02:57:48.451
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

1675
02:57:50.786 --> 02:57:54.415
When you're so afraid, nothing can help.

1676
02:57:55.249 --> 02:57:56.501
Nothing.

1677
02:58:05.301 --> 02:58:06.761
We shall see.

1678
02:58:31.536 --> 02:58:33.746
Could we have won, Spartacus?

1679
02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:37.959
Could we ever have won?

1680
02:58:42.588 --> 02:58:45.299
Just by fighting them, we won something.

1681
02:58:48.803 --> 02:58:51.430
When just one man says "No, I won't,"

1682
02:58:52.139 --> 02:58:53.933
Rome begins to fear.

1683
02:58:59.355 --> 02:59:01.983
We were tens of thousands who said no.

1684
02:59:03.109 --> 02:59:05.152
That was the wonder of it.

1685
02:59:05.987 --> 02:59:09.240
To have seen slaves
lift their heads from the dust,

1686
02:59:11.951 --> 02:59:16.622
to see them rise from their knees, stand tall

1687
02:59:19.417 --> 02:59:21.419
with a song on their lips,

1688
02:59:23.254 --> 02:59:24.672
to hear them

1689
02:59:26.215 --> 02:59:29.594
storm through the mountains shouting,

1690
02:59:32.221 --> 02:59:34.724
to hear them sing along the plains.

1691
02:59:38.477 --> 02:59:40.271
And now they're dead.

1692
02:59:43.232 --> 02:59:44.358
Dead.

1693
02:59:51.282 --> 02:59:52.491
Varinia

1694
02:59:56.370 --> 02:59:57.455
dead.

1695
03:00:01.792 --> 03:00:03.252
And the baby.

1696
03:00:16.891 --> 03:00:18.267
All of them.

1697
03:00:29.487 --> 03:00:31.906
Are you afraid to die, Spartacus?

1698
03:00:32.948 --> 03:00:34.033
Hmm.

1699
03:00:35.076 --> 03:00:37.370
No more than I was to be born.

1700
03:00:48.673 --> 03:00:50.216
Are you afraid?

1701
03:00:53.803 --> 03:00:54.887
Yes.

1702
03:01:08.067 --> 03:01:09.443
Hail Consul!

1703
03:01:10.152 --> 03:01:11.779
Guard, fall in.

1704
03:01:12.822 --> 03:01:15.658
- Where are the gladiators?
- Over there, sir.

1705
03:01:40.141 --> 03:01:43.936
Antoninus, the night passes slowly,
doesn't it?

1706
03:01:55.531 --> 03:01:56.866
Spartacus.

1707
03:02:02.747 --> 03:02:06.876
You are he, aren't you?

1708
03:02:10.337 --> 03:02:14.133
Gladiator, I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

1709
03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:21.891
You must answer when I speak to you.

1710
03:02:45.456 --> 03:02:46.791
Centurion!

1711
03:02:49.877 --> 03:02:53.547
Let them fight now. Unchain them.

1712
03:02:53.756 --> 03:02:58.052
The entire city's been told they'll fight
tomorrow in the temple of your ancestors.

1713
03:02:58.135 --> 03:03:01.138
They will fight now for me. Here!

1714
03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:05.059
And to the death.
And the victor shall be crucified.

1715
03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:09.021
We will test this myth of slave brotherhood.

1716
03:03:09.522 --> 03:03:10.981
Unchain them!

1717
03:03:18.948 --> 03:03:20.449
Form a circle.

1718
03:03:37.341 --> 03:03:39.468
Don't give them the pleasure of a contest.

1719
03:03:39.552 --> 03:03:41.262
Lower your guard.
I'll kill you on the first rush.

1720
03:03:41.345 --> 03:03:42.429
I won't let them crucify you.

1721
03:03:42.513 --> 03:03:44.807
It's my last order. Obey it.

1722
03:03:44.890 --> 03:03:46.433
Let them begin.

1723
03:04:23.262 --> 03:04:25.472
I won't let them crucify you.

1724
03:04:36.358 --> 03:04:39.028
Do you realize how long it takes
to die on a cross?

1725
03:04:39.111 --> 03:04:40.404
I don't care!

1726
03:04:57.546 --> 03:04:59.423
Forgive me, Antoninus.

1727
03:05:09.892 --> 03:05:14.188
I love you, Spartacus,
as I loved my own father.

1728
03:05:14.855 --> 03:05:19.193
I love you like my son that I'll never see.

1729
03:05:23.864 --> 03:05:25.282
Go to sleep.

1730
03:05:59.984 --> 03:06:01.735
Here's your victory.

1731
03:06:04.071 --> 03:06:05.698
He'll come back.

1732
03:06:06.323 --> 03:06:09.034
He'll come back and he'll be millions!

1733
03:06:13.622 --> 03:06:16.083
I wonder what Spartacus would say

1734
03:06:16.959 --> 03:06:20.379
if he knew that the woman, Varinia,
and her child

1735
03:06:21.296 --> 03:06:23.590
are slaves in my household?

1736
03:06:36.729 --> 03:06:37.771
Yes.

1737
03:06:41.066 --> 03:06:42.401
Spartacus.

1738
03:06:47.114 --> 03:06:48.490
Crucify him!

1739
03:07:07.259 --> 03:07:09.762
I want no grave for him. No marker.

1740
03:07:09.970 --> 03:07:13.599
His body's to be burned
and his ashes scattered in secret.

1741
03:07:23.150 --> 03:07:25.152
Did you fear him, Crassus?

1742
03:07:25.694 --> 03:07:28.947
Not when I fought him.
I knew he could be beaten.

1743
03:07:30.032 --> 03:07:33.827
But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

1744
03:07:33.911 --> 03:07:37.623
- Me?
- Yes, my dear Caesar. You!

1745
03:07:39.792 --> 03:07:43.337
I don't see the letter here
to the leader of the Senate.

1746
03:07:43.629 --> 03:07:47.091
Oh, yes.
Julia, I don't like the sound of weeping.

1747
03:07:47.174 --> 03:07:49.676
This is a happy house. Please stop.

1748
03:07:51.178 --> 03:07:54.306
Oh, there you are. Go away, Julia!
Where have you been?

1749
03:07:54.348 --> 03:07:56.850
The city is full of Crassus' legions.
We've been hiding.

1750
03:07:56.892 --> 03:07:59.394
I don't know Rome as well as I know Capua.

1751
03:07:59.478 --> 03:08:01.563
They're arresting everyone.

1752
03:08:11.365 --> 03:08:15.577
So this is the woman it took Crassus
eight Roman legions to conquer.

1753
03:08:15.661 --> 03:08:18.956
I wish I had time
to make your acquaintance, my dear.

1754
03:08:19.039 --> 03:08:23.961
Unfortunately, we all have to make journeys
to different destinations.

1755
03:08:24.419 --> 03:08:26.213
Where are we going?

1756
03:08:27.005 --> 03:08:30.008
You're going to Aquitania. The governor's
one of my innumerable cousins.

1757
03:08:30.050 --> 03:08:33.470
Here's a senatorial pass.
It's valid in all the known world.

1758
03:08:33.554 --> 03:08:37.724
- Why do I have to go to Aquitania?
- 'Cause I asked you to.

1759
03:08:37.766 --> 03:08:40.269
It's very good of you, Gracchus, but I...

1760
03:08:40.352 --> 03:08:44.231
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.

1761
03:08:44.273 --> 03:08:45.732
Two million?

1762
03:08:46.608 --> 03:08:50.279
Here. Articles of freedom for the woman.

1763
03:08:50.612 --> 03:08:54.908
And here's a smaller document
that I've prepared for the child,

1764
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:56.702
befitting its size.

1765
03:09:02.916 --> 03:09:05.752
- Where are you going?
- Mmm?

1766
03:09:06.628 --> 03:09:08.422
Oh, to Picenum.

1767
03:09:08.755 --> 03:09:11.216
Picenum? That's the dreariest town in Italy.

1768
03:09:11.258 --> 03:09:13.260
Will you please leave me?

1769
03:09:15.179 --> 03:09:19.266
Come with us.
See to it that I don't misuse the money.

1770
03:09:19.391 --> 03:09:21.727
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a senator.

1771
03:09:21.768 --> 03:09:24.938
Will you please go
before the soldiers come here?

1772
03:09:30.319 --> 03:09:31.820
Oh.

1773
03:09:32.321 --> 03:09:35.407
This would really make Crassus jealous.

1774
03:09:37.451 --> 03:09:39.453
Go and make my joy complete.

1775
03:09:39.494 --> 03:09:42.581
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.

1776
03:09:51.465 --> 03:09:54.134
Well. Prettier.

1777
03:10:14.029 --> 03:10:15.155
Halt!

1778
03:10:20.702 --> 03:10:22.746
Identify yourselves, please.

1779
03:10:22.829 --> 03:10:25.165
Lentulus Batiatus.

1780
03:10:25.249 --> 03:10:27.668
Climb down, please,
and identify yourselves.

1781
03:10:27.709 --> 03:10:30.754
- I object to that tone.
- I've got my orders.

1782
03:10:30.837 --> 03:10:33.674
Come down and identify yourselves, please.

1783
03:10:41.181 --> 03:10:44.851
As I told you, I'm Lentulus Batiatus,
the lanista from Capua.

1784
03:10:44.893 --> 03:10:48.313
This... My sister-in-law.

1785
03:10:51.984 --> 03:10:53.819
Lady, please.

1786
03:10:54.903 --> 03:10:59.366
She's traveling with her child to Aquitania

1787
03:10:59.449 --> 03:11:01.785
on a senatorial pass.

1788
03:11:01.868 --> 03:11:05.289
- Take a look through his baggage.
- Not a word, please.

1789
03:11:11.878 --> 03:11:13.547
What did you say?

1790
03:11:23.849 --> 03:11:25.726
Oh, Spartacus.

1791
03:11:56.214 --> 03:11:59.259
- Tell the lady no loitering's allowed.
- Instantly.

1792
03:11:59.343 --> 03:12:00.844
- Move on.
- Yes.

1793
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:06.975
This is your son.

1794
03:12:09.394 --> 03:12:12.773
He's free, Spartacus! Free!

1795
03:12:16.068 --> 03:12:17.444
He's free.

1796
03:12:19.112 --> 03:12:20.822
He's free.

1797
03:12:23.700 --> 03:12:27.788
He'll remember you, Spartacus,
because I'll tell him.

1798
03:12:29.623 --> 03:12:33.126
I'll tell him who his father was
and what he dreamed of.

1799
03:12:36.296 --> 03:12:39.591
Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.

1800
03:12:41.009 --> 03:12:42.803
Oh, my love, my life.

1801
03:12:45.639 --> 03:12:47.849
Please die, die.

1802
03:12:48.475 --> 03:12:51.103
Please, please die, my love.

1803
03:12:51.853 --> 03:12:53.939
Oh, God, why can't you die!

1804
03:12:53.980 --> 03:12:55.982
Come on. Come on.

1805
03:13:12.082 --> 03:13:14.584
Goodbye, my love, my life.

1806
03:13:15.085 --> 03:13:16.920
Goodbye, goodbye.
