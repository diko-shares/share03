00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.513
MALE NARRATOR: In the last century,

2
00:07:52.554 --> 00:07:56.016
before the birth
of the new faith called Christianity,

3
00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.811
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of Rome

4
00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:01.188
and bring about a new society,

5
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.401
the Roman Republic stood
at the very center of the civilized world.

6
00:08:06.193 --> 00:08:08.946
"Of all things fairest,” sang the poet,

7
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:13.492
“first among cities and home of the gods
is golden Rome.”

8
00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:16.245
Yet, even at the zenith
of her pride and power

9
00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:19.415
the Republic lay fatally stricken
with a disease

10
00:08:19.456 --> 00:08:21.417
called human slavery.

11
00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:24.586
The age of the dictator was at hand

12
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.132
waiting in the shadows
for the event to bring it forth.

13
00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.926
In that same century,

14
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.721
in the conquered Greek province of Thrace,

15
00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:37.182
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master's wealth

16
00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:41.562
by giving birth to a son
whom she named Spartacus.

17
00:08:41.603 --> 00:08:44.023
A proud, rebellious son

18
00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:47.276
who was sold to living death
in the mines of Libya

19
00:08:47.317 --> 00:08:49.653
before his thirteenth birthday.

20
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.907
There, under whip and chain and sun,

21
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:56.952
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood,

22
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.288
dreaming the death of slavery

23
00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:02.708
2,000 years before it finally would die.

24
00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.086
SOLDIER 1: Back to work!

25
00:09:48.003 --> 00:09:49.505
Back to work!

26
00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.846
SOLDIER 2: Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

27
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.724
Come on, get up! Get up! Get...

28
00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:04.019
(SCREAMS) Oh, my ankle! My ankle!

29
00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.189
My ankle!

30
00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:12.319
Guard! Guard!

31
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.737
(GROANING)

32
00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.243
SOLDIER 3: Spartacus again, huh?
Well, this time he dies.

33
00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.496
Move along! Back to work, all of you!

34
00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:45.644
-Welcome, Lentulus Batiatus.
-Welcome, indeed, my dear Captain.

35
00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:54.361
Oh, 11 miles through this disastrous heat

36
00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:57.281
and the cost of hiring an escort, ruinous.

37
00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:02.578
Even so, I warrant you have nothing
fit to sell me, have you, Captain?

38
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:05.080
I've wasted both my time and my money.

39
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:08.917
-Tell me the truth.
-We have a few you might be interested in.

40
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:11.628
BATIATUS: These? Carrion.

41
00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:13.714
The buzzards are late.

42
00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:16.300
This one's not bad. He's a Gaul.

43
00:11:16.383 --> 00:11:18.927
Oh, I don't like Gauls. Hairy.

44
00:11:21.138 --> 00:11:22.806
Can he come down unassisted?

45
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.349
Come down, you.

46
00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:26.643
Come down!

47
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.444
-Be good enough to show me the teeth.
-Open your mouth.

48
00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:36.862
Thank you.

49
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:42.284
Yes, as the teeth go, so go the bones.

50
00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:46.330
This mouth is really impermissible.

51
00:11:46.413 --> 00:11:49.958
-The fellow's made of chalk.
-We have many others.

52
00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:59.134
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

53
00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:04.306
-Who's that?
-Oh, this one's a Thracian.

54
00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:06.934
-I'm making an example of him.
-How?

55
00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:09.311
-Starve him to death.
-Oh.

56
00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:11.313
It's the only thing that impresses slaves.

57
00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:12.981
Oh, what a pity.

58
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:18.403
He reacts. Good muscle tone.

59
00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.740
Can I see his teeth?

60
00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:23.951
Open your mouth, Spartacus.

61
00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:27.621
You smell like a rhinoceros.

62
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.459
Captain, the teeth.
You asked him to open his mouth.

63
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:36.129
-He doesn't obey you?
-His teeth are the best thing about him.

64
00:12:36.171 --> 00:12:38.590
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

65
00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:42.552
Marvelous. I wish I'd been here. I'll take him.

66
00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:44.596
Let's look at some of the others.

67
00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:52.980
Come along.

68
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:59.546
In spite of sickness and death,
we will profit 11,000 sesterces.

69
00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:02.049
Including your commission, of course.

70
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.135
Oh, no, sir. Without my commission.

71
00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:10.474
Marcellus, there they are.

72
00:14:10.557 --> 00:14:13.018
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

73
00:14:13.101 --> 00:14:16.021
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

74
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:19.816
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

75
00:14:21.109 --> 00:14:22.694
Slaves,

76
00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:26.907
you have arrived at the gladiatorial school
of Lentulus Batiatus.

77
00:14:26.948 --> 00:14:30.827
You'll be trained by experts
to fight in pairs to the death.

78
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:34.122
You won't fight to the death here.

79
00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:36.124
That will be after you've been sold

80
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.168
and then for
ladies and gentlemen of quality,

81
00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:40.879
for those who appreciate a fine Kill.

82
00:14:42.255 --> 00:14:45.509
A gladiator's like a stallion,
he must be pampered.

83
00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.886
You'll be oiled, bathed,

84
00:14:47.969 --> 00:14:52.099
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

85
00:14:53.475 --> 00:14:57.187
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself.

86
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.356
You'll be given your ceremonial caudas.

87
00:14:59.439 --> 00:15:01.525
Marcellus, please. There.

88
00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:04.486
Be proud of them.

89
00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:08.490
On special occasions, those who please me

90
00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:12.119
will even be given the companionship
of a young lady.

91
00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:15.997
Approximately half our graduates

92
00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:19.501
live for five, 10, 10 years.

93
00:15:19.876 --> 00:15:23.964
Some even attain freedom
and become trainers themselves.

94
00:15:24.005 --> 00:15:25.590
(CHUCKLING) Marcellus.

95
00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:27.843
I congratulate you.

96
00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:30.887
And may fortune smile on most of you.

97

(BLOWING WHISTLE)

98
00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:38.937
Marcellus, watch the second from the right.

99
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.107
He's a Thracian. They were going to Kill him
for hamstringing a guard.

100
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.777
-We'll break him of that.
-Don't overdo it. He has quality.

105
00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:10.886
I like you.

106
00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:14.639
I want you to be my friend.

107
00:16:16.057 --> 00:16:18.059
I want to be your friend.

108
00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:21.897
All I ask is that you get along with me.

109
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.443
What's your name, slave?

110
00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:28.778
Spartacus.

111
00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:32.657
I feel you don't like me.

112
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.874
Give him your sword.

113
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:45.712
Take it!

114
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:55.889
I have a feeling you want to kill me.

115
00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.227
This is the only chance you'll ever get.

116
00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:01.895
Kill me.

117
00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.273
Don't be afraid, slave.

118
00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:07.776
You have that sword.

119
00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:10.612
I only have this piece of wood.

120
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.617
Are you going to disobey me?

121
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:18.787
(LAUGHS)

122
00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.915
Take his sword.

123
00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:26.044
You're not as stupid as I thought.

124
00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:28.338
You might even be intelligent.

125
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.632
That's dangerous for slaves.

126
00:17:31.758 --> 00:17:36.513
You just remember, from now on
everything you do I'll be watching.

127
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:10.422
You did the right thing.

128
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:15.093
Every once in a while
Marcellus likes to kill a man as an example.

129
00:18:15.468 --> 00:18:19.014
I think he's picked you. Better watch him.

130
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.854
-How long have you been here?
-Six months.

131
00:18:25.895 --> 00:18:27.731
I wish he'd pick me.

132
00:18:27.814 --> 00:18:31.109

before they carry me out!

You don't want to know my name.

I don't want to know your name.

138

Just a friendly question.

139
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.302
Gladiators don't make friends.

179
00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:41.706
Second rule,

180
00:25:41.956 --> 00:25:44.709
go for the cripple before the slow Kill.

181
00:25:45.209 --> 00:25:47.628
Here's a slow Kill on the yellow.

182
00:25:47.962 --> 00:25:51.799
Here, here and here.

183
00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:53.968
Remember,

184
00:25:54.427 --> 00:25:58.181
a slow kill may have enough left in him
to kill you before he dies.

185
00:25:58.681 --> 00:26:00.141
With a cripple, you know you've got him

186
00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:02.185
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

187
00:26:02.268 --> 00:26:05.146
The rest is all right
for a public spectacle in Rome,

188
00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:08.357
but here at Capua
we expect more than simple butchery

189
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:09.942
and we get it.

190
00:26:11.944 --> 00:26:15.323
Spartacus, why are you looking at that girl?

191
00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:19.744
Varinia! Stand still.

(LAUGHING)

193
00:26:24.999 --> 00:26:27.376
Since all you can do is look at girls,

194
00:26:28.002 --> 00:26:31.380
all right, slave, go ahead and look.

195
00:26:32.965 --> 00:26:34.550
I said, look.

197
00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:19.554
No. No, this one goes to the Spaniard.

198
00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:29.397
Have a good night's rest, Spartacus.

I've warned you about this kind of thing.

207
00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.461
All right, bring them in.

00:28:53.522 --> 00:28:56.400
No talking! Move along.

209
00:30:00.214 --> 00:30:01.882

No.

216
00:31:59.834 --> 00:32:02.336
We have visitors, tremendous visitors.

217
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.548
Two simply enormous
Roman lords on the hill.

218
00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:07.591
How easily impressed you are, Ramon.

219
00:32:07.675 --> 00:32:09.885
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

220
00:32:09.969 --> 00:32:11.971
Tell them to wait for me when they arrive.

221
00:32:12.012 --> 00:32:15.850
-Master, you don't understand...
-How enormous do these Roman lords get?

222
00:32:15.891 --> 00:32:18.769
One of them is Marcus Licinius Crassus.

223
00:32:18.853 --> 00:32:20.521
What? Wait a minute.

224
00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:24.108
Crassus here? My red toga with the acorns.

225
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:26.610
Chairs in the atrium. Second-best wine.

226
00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:29.989
No, the best, but small goblets.

227
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.199
Gracchus.
You know how Crassus loathes him.

(GRUNTING)

229
00:32:33.784 --> 00:32:37.037
-Take him away.
-I can't lift it.

230
00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.707
Use your imagination. Cover him.

231
00:32:39.748 --> 00:32:42.293
Tell Marcellus to get the men ready.

232
00:32:42.376 --> 00:32:44.837
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show.

Forgive me, Gracchus.

No.

Welcome to the Lady Claudia Maria,

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.455
former wife of Lucius Caius Marius

246
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:05.000
whose recent execution
touched us all deeply.

247
00:34:05.834 --> 00:34:07.169
Honor to the Lady Helena,

248
00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:10.464
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus,

249
00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:14.051
whose fame shall live on forever
in the person of his son,

250
00:34:14.134 --> 00:34:15.636
your brother,

251
00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.973
Marcus Publius Glabrus,

252
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.475
hero of the Eastern War.

253
00:34:21.517 --> 00:34:23.269
How very much he knows.

254
00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:26.689
Allow me to bring you up-to-date.

255
00:34:26.772 --> 00:34:30.192
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

256
00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:33.028
A mating of eagles, Your Sanctity.

00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:34.780
Fan His Magnitude. He sweats.

258
00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:36.073
-No, no.
-No, no.

259
00:34:36.156 --> 00:34:38.826
My young friends desire
a private showing of two pairs.

260
00:34:38.867 --> 00:34:40.619
Two pairs?

261
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:44.164
Oh, yes. I have something
that would please them.

262
00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:45.916
Two pairs to the death.

263
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.502
To the death, Your Ladyship?

264
00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:51.088
Surely you don't think
we came all the way to Capua

265
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:52.840

But I beg, Your Honors,

268
00:34:56.302 --> 00:34:59.972
we train the finest gladiators in all Italy.

269
00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:01.890
We can give you a display
of swordsmanship

270
00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:04.810
which is better than you can see in Rome.

271
00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:08.022
When they're sold, their new masters
may do with them as they wish.

272
00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:11.984
But here, no,
we never fight them to the death.

273
00:35:12.026 --> 00:35:16.363
-Crassus.
-Today is an exception.

274
00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:20.284
But the ill feeling, it would spread
through the whole school.

275
00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:23.537
Then the cost. Oh, the cost.

276
00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.247
Name your price.

277
00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:30.085
25,000 sesterces.

278
00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:32.421
Arrange it.

279
00:35:33.797 --> 00:35:35.591
Are you serious, sir?

280
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.678
Arrange it immediately.

281
00:35:40.387 --> 00:35:43.140
Of course,
we shall want to choose them ourselves.

282
00:35:43.223 --> 00:35:46.560
You do have a certain variety?

283
00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:47.936
Inexhaustible.

284
00:35:55.778 --> 00:35:59.073
Spartacus, there's going to be a fight
to the death.

285
00:35:59.406 --> 00:36:01.033
-To the death?
-How do you know?

286
00:36:01.075 --> 00:36:03.452
I heard Marcellus tell one of his guards.

287
00:36:03.535 --> 00:36:05.579
-Who fights?
-I don't know.

288
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.000
To the death.

289
00:36:13.212 --> 00:36:15.547
What if they matched you and me?

290
00:36:16.924 --> 00:36:18.592
They won't.

291
00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.302
What if they did?

292
00:36:21.053 --> 00:36:22.638
Would you fight?

293
00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:27.267
I'd have to. So would you.

294
00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.354
Would you try to kill me?

295
00:36:32.272 --> 00:36:33.774
Yes, I'd kill.

296
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.568
I'd try to stay...

297
00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.613
I'd try to stay alive, and so would you.

298
00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:42.783
MARCELLUS: All gladiators
up to the training area.

299
00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:45.244
Some visitors want to admire you.

300
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.167
Form a line in front of me.

301
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:56.255
Would Your Excellencies
care to make your selection now?

302
00:36:58.257 --> 00:36:59.466
Claudia.

303
00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:03.137
(INAUDIBLE)

304
00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:11.186
Oh, they're magnificent.

305
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.522
For you, Lady Helena,

306
00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:16.150
may I suggest Praxus?

307
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:19.820
A veritable tiger.

308
00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:22.531
I don't like him.

309
00:37:28.996 --> 00:37:30.414
I prefer that one.

310
00:37:30.497 --> 00:37:32.374
-Which one?
-No, no.

311
00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:34.585
David?

312
00:37:34.668 --> 00:37:37.171
Oh, Crixus, yes.

313
00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:40.591
Marcellus, Crixus for the short sword.

314
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.384
Ah!

315
00:37:45.179 --> 00:37:48.682
Have you ever seen
such a pair of shoulders? Dionysius.

316
00:37:49.516 --> 00:37:53.187
I admit he's small,
but he's very compact and extremely strong.

317
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.147
In fact, he looks...

318
00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:58.901
He looks smaller here
than he does in the arena.

319
00:38:00.986 --> 00:38:02.196
Optical.

320
00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:05.491
Give me that one.

321
00:38:06.116 --> 00:38:09.369
Oh, Galino. Yes, yes. Galino.

322
00:38:09.411 --> 00:38:13.499
You have a shrewd eye, Your Pulchritude,
if I may permit myself the...

323
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.083
Galino.

324
00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:19.046
Practically every man in this school
is an expert with a Thracian sword

325
00:38:19.087 --> 00:38:23.091
but the trident
is something very rare these days.

326
00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:27.304
May I suggest the Ethiopian?

327
00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:29.765
(GIGGLING)

328
00:38:29.848 --> 00:38:32.810
There are very few Ethiopians
in the country.

329
00:38:33.393 --> 00:38:37.147
Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

330
00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:45.155
I'll take him.

331
00:38:46.281 --> 00:38:49.076
Draba? Oh, no. For you I want the best.

332
00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:52.162
-I do think the Ethiopian...
-I want the most beautiful.

333
00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:54.414
I'll take the big black one.

334
00:38:56.416 --> 00:38:57.584
Draba.

335
00:38:59.044 --> 00:39:02.464
Only one man in the entire school
stands a chance

336
00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:06.051
with the Thracian knife against the trident.

337
00:39:06.093 --> 00:39:07.636
There.

338
00:39:08.762 --> 00:39:11.640
-Over there, Lady Helena.
-He's impertinent.

339
00:39:12.808 --> 00:39:14.059
I'll take him.

340
00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:18.272
And he's a coward to boot.
Have him flogged.

341
00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:22.317
Over there, Lady Helena. The beast of Libya.

342
00:39:22.442 --> 00:39:23.485
(LAUGHING)

343
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:25.320
I prefer the coward.

344
00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.450
Spartacus.

345
00:39:30.492 --> 00:39:34.538
If both men are down and refuse to fight
your trainer will slit their throats.

346
00:39:34.621 --> 00:39:35.998
We want no tricks.

347
00:39:36.081 --> 00:39:38.417
BATIATUS: Tricks, madam?
At the school of Batiatus?

348
00:39:38.458 --> 00:39:41.962
You heard the instruction, Marcellus?
Remember it.

349
00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:45.799
I feel sorry for the poor things in this heat.

350
00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:48.468
Don't put them in those suffocating tunics.

351
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:51.138
Let them wear just enough for modesty.

352
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:54.433
Whatever they wear, Lady,
they'll bless your name.

353
00:39:55.642 --> 00:39:57.519
MARCELLUS: Back, the rest of you.

354
00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:59.730
Our choosing has bored you?

355
00:39:59.813 --> 00:40:03.191

I thought you had reservations
about the gods.

528
01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:43.032
Privately, I believe in none. Neither do you.

529
01:01:43.115 --> 01:01:44.783
Publicly, I believe in them all.

530
01:01:44.825 --> 01:01:47.328
Greetings, Marcus Clodius Flavius!

531
01:02:17.191 --> 01:02:18.651
Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?

532
01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:21.737
-He awaits you in the atrium, sir.
-Excellent.

533
01:02:24.156 --> 01:02:27.660
-What have we here?
-A gift from the Governor of Sicily.

534
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:46.637
"Antoninus. Sicilian, age 26,

535
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.515
"singer of songs."

536
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:53.435
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

537
01:02:53.727 --> 01:02:57.982
For the children of my master
whom I also taught the classics.

538
01:02:58.023 --> 01:03:00.025
Classics, indeed.

539
01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:04.196
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

540
01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:05.656
Hmm?

541
01:03:07.032 --> 01:03:08.867
You shall be my body servant. Instruct him.

542
01:03:08.909 --> 01:03:10.911
All of you, come with me.

543
01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:27.594
CRASSUS: Are you on guard duty?

544
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:33.392
My dear Crassus, congratulate me.

545
01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:36.562
Or better still,
let us congratulate each other.

546
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.398
I congratulate us.

547
01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:44.111
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts of the garrison
against the slaves on Vesuvius.

548
01:03:44.194 --> 01:03:46.697
The whole city is turning out to see us off.

549
01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:49.074
Great merciful bloodstained gods!

550
01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:51.827
Your pardon.

551
01:03:52.036 --> 01:03:55.039
I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

552
01:03:56.248 --> 01:03:59.001
Did Gracchus have something to do
with this brilliant affair?

553
01:03:59.084 --> 01:04:02.421
Yes, he proposed it. Rather decently, too.

554
01:04:02.504 --> 01:04:03.756
And you?

555
01:04:03.797 --> 01:04:08.510
Do you think I made you commander
to control some rock patch on Vesuvius?

556
01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.221
It was to control the streets of Rome!

557
01:04:11.263 --> 01:04:15.100
I only take six cohorts.
The rest of the garrison remain.

558
01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.603
-Under whose command?
-Under Caesar's.

559
01:04:17.644 --> 01:04:20.314
Oh, excellent, excellent.

560
01:04:20.397 --> 01:04:23.108
Finding Gracchus in control of the mob
and the Senate,

561
01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:26.779
you felt impelled to hand over
the garrison to him also.

562
01:04:28.155 --> 01:04:29.531
I see.

563
01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:33.619
I'll refuse, withdraw from the expedition.

564
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.621
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician

565
01:04:35.704 --> 01:04:38.624
is that occasionally
you're obliged to act like one.

566
01:04:38.665 --> 01:04:40.876
You've pledged to go, and go you must.

567
01:04:40.959 --> 01:04:43.087
If Gracchus should decide to move
against you...

568
01:04:43.128 --> 01:04:45.381
He won't! Has no need to.

569
01:04:45.464 --> 01:04:48.967
He has, with your assistance,
immobilized me altogether.

570
01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:53.555
Your legions are in camp
outside the city walls?

571

My legions?

572
01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:59.186
Do you truly believe
I'd order my legions to enter Rome?

573
01:04:59.269 --> 01:05:01.980
You can, if you have to.

574
01:05:02.022 --> 01:05:04.316
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law,

575
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.778
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

576
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.323
-Sulla did.
-Sulla? To the infamy of his name!

577
01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:14.159

One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

I shall restore all the traditions
that made her great.

582
01:05:27.506 --> 01:05:30.300
It follows that I cannot come to power
or defend myself

583
01:05:30.342 --> 01:05:33.929
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of all.

584
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.933
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

585
01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:41.478
I shall not violate Rome

586
01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.440

587
01:05:48.694 --> 01:05:49.695

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:25.056
-Hasn't she? I like it.
-So do I.

702
01:17:26.766 --> 01:17:29.310
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

703
01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:33.022
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

704
01:17:33.064 --> 01:17:36.985
Have you noticed the nastiest of tyrants
are invariably thin?

705
01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:43.449
In spite of your vices, you are
the most generous Roman of our time.

706
01:17:43.533 --> 01:17:44.826
Vices?

707
01:17:47.287 --> 01:17:48.496
Ladies.

708
01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:54.252
Ladies? Since when are they a vice?

709
01:17:54.752 --> 01:17:58.298
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

710
01:17:58.381 --> 01:18:00.758
I hope I pronounced that word...

711
01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:03.678
It's well-known that
even your groom and butler are women.

712
01:18:03.761 --> 01:18:06.181
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.

713
01:18:06.472 --> 01:18:10.018
I keep these women out of my respect
for Roman morality.

714
01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.478
That morality which
has made Rome strong enough

715
01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:15.273
to steal two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners,

716
01:18:15.356 --> 01:18:18.943
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

717
01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:22.447
I happen to like women.
I have a promiscuous nature

718
01:18:22.488 --> 01:18:25.575
and unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow

719
01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:28.244
which my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

720
01:18:28.286 --> 01:18:31.581
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

721
01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:32.874
Exactly.

722
01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:37.670
It must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity.

723
01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:40.048
(LAUGHS)

724
01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:42.967
It is.

725
01:18:43.509 --> 01:18:47.055
Let's mix business with pleasure.
How may I help you?

726
01:18:49.599 --> 01:18:53.061
Great Gracchus, I find it difficult to hate,

727
01:18:53.144 --> 01:18:55.480
but there's one man
I can't think of without fuming.

728
01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:56.981
-Who's that?
-Crassus.

729
01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:59.817
You've grown very ambitious in your hatred.

730
01:18:59.859 --> 01:19:03.321
Do you blame me? There I was,
better than a millionaire in the morning

731
01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:07.742
and a penniless refugee by nightfall
with nothing but rags and my flesh.

732
01:19:07.825 --> 01:19:11.162
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua

733
01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:14.374
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs.

734
01:19:14.874 --> 01:19:17.418
These two daughters of Venus

735
01:19:17.502 --> 01:19:20.213
had to taunt the gladiators,
force them to fight to the death,

736
01:19:20.296 --> 01:19:23.341
and before I knew what had happened,
revolution on my hands.

737
01:19:23.383 --> 01:19:27.220
What revenge have you in mind?

738
01:19:29.013 --> 01:19:32.058
-I sold Crassus this woman Varinia.
-Whom?

739
01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:35.645
Varinia. May the gods give her wings.

740
01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:36.729
There was no contract,

741
01:19:36.813 --> 01:19:40.650
but she was clearly his slave
as soon as the deal was made.

742
01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:43.278
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

743
01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:46.656
And Crassus, (SCOFFS)
no mention of money.

744
01:19:47.573 --> 01:19:50.368
You never offered me this woman. Why not?

745
01:19:51.035 --> 01:19:53.705
Well, she's not
remotely your type, Gracchus.

746
01:19:53.746 --> 01:19:56.708
-She is very thin and...
-Look around you.

747
01:19:57.166 --> 01:20:01.546
-You'll see women of all sizes.
-Well, yes.

748
01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:04.507
500 sesterces deposit on Varinia.

749
01:20:04.549 --> 01:20:08.761
Since he hasn't paid, this gives me first call
over Crassus when she's caught.

750
01:20:09.345 --> 01:20:11.222
May the gods adore you.

751
01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:14.392
Why do you buy a woman
you've never seen?

752
01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:17.312
To annoy Crassus, of course, and help you.

753
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.404
Fetch a stool, Antoninus.

754
01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:34.329
In here with it.

755
01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:42.587
That will do.

756
01:20:49.802 --> 01:20:51.763
Do you steal, Antoninus?

757
01:20:52.055 --> 01:20:53.431
No, master.

758
01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:55.767
Do you lie?

759
01:20:56.934 --> 01:20:58.770
Not if I can avoid it.

760
01:21:00.313 --> 01:21:03.691
Have you ever dishonored the gods?

761
01:21:03.775 --> 01:21:05.151
No, master.

762
01:21:06.486 --> 01:21:10.740
Do you refrain from these vices
out of respect for the moral virtues?

763
01:21:11.407 --> 01:21:12.784
Yes, master.

764
01:21:16.954 --> 01:21:18.664
Do you eat oysters?

765
01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.542
When I have them, master.

766
01:21:22.335 --> 01:21:24.003
Do you eat snails?

767
01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.422
No, master.

768
01:21:28.424 --> 01:21:30.802
Do you consider
the eating of oysters to be moral

769
01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:33.596
and the eating of snails to be immoral?

770
01:21:35.306 --> 01:21:36.641
No, master.

771
01:21:37.558 --> 01:21:39.060
Of course not.

772
01:21:42.313 --> 01:21:44.941
It is all a matter of taste, isn't it?

773
01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.818
Yes, master.

774
01:21:48.111 --> 01:21:50.696
And taste is not the same as appetite

775
01:21:51.322 --> 01:21:54.325
and therefore
not a question of morals, is it?

776
01:21:56.619 --> 01:21:57.662
Mmm.

777
01:22:00.289 --> 01:22:02.500
It could be argued so, master.

778
01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.673
That will do. My robe, Antoninus.

779
01:22:25.356 --> 01:22:27.233
My taste includes

780
01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.903
both snails and oysters.

781
01:22:40.204 --> 01:22:41.831

783
01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.504

784
01:22:52.842 --> 01:22:55.595

There is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus.

No man can withstand Rome.

789

There's only one way
to deal with Rome, Antoninus.

795
01:23:32.924 --> 01:23:34.634
You must serve her.

796
01:23:36.385 --> 01:23:38.888
You must abase yourself before her.

797

I turn home.

876
01:31:15.886 --> 01:31:18.472
Through blue shadows and purple woods,

877
01:31:19.682 --> 01:31:21.058
I turn home.

878
01:31:22.559 --> 01:31:25.104
I turn to the place that I was born,

879
01:31:25.396 --> 01:31:28.816
to the mother who bore me
and the father who taught me,

880
01:31:29.233 --> 01:31:32.987
long ago, long ago, long ago.

881
01:31:35.197 --> 01:31:39.493
Alone am I now, lost and alone
in a far, wide, wondering world.

882
01:31:41.328 --> 01:31:44.790
Yet still when the blazing sun hangs low,

883
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:49.837
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps,

884
01:31:51.422 --> 01:31:54.258
and twilight touches the wondering earth,

885
01:31:56.093 --> 01:31:57.511
I turn home.

886
01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:05.811
Where'd you learn that song?

887
01:32:06.603 --> 01:32:08.605
My father taught it to me.

888
01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.817
I was wrong about you, poet.

889
01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:14.528
You won't learn to Kill.
You'll teach us songs.

890
01:32:14.611 --> 01:32:16.405
I came here to fight.

891
01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:20.451
Anyone can learn to fight.

892
01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:22.953
ANTONINUS: I joined to fight.

893
01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:29.960
-What's your name?
-Antoninus.

894
01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.380
Antoninus.

895
01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:37.801
There's a time for fighting
and a time for singing.

896
01:32:38.302 --> 01:32:40.304
Now you teach us to sing.

897
01:32:40.846 --> 01:32:42.473
Sing, Antoninus.

898
01:32:49.396 --> 01:32:52.441
ANTONINUS: When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky...

899
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:56.361
You like him, don't you?

900
01:33:00.824 --> 01:33:02.576
Who wants to fight?

901
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:07.831
An animal can learn to fight.

902
01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:13.504
But to sing beautiful things

903
01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:17.424

906
01:33:37.152 --> 01:33:38.403
I'm free.

907
01:33:40.656 --> 01:33:42.366
And what do I know?

908
01:33:43.867 --> 01:33:46.078
I don't even know how to read.

909
01:33:48.205 --> 01:33:50.833
You know things that can't be taught.

910
01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:54.753
I know nothing.

911
01:33:55.671 --> 01:33:56.922
Nothing.

912
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:03.470
And I want to know. I want to...

913
01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:08.767
I want to know.

914
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:11.645
Know what?

915
01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:17.734
Everything.

916
01:34:20.237 --> 01:34:22.906
Why a star falls and a bird doesn't.

917
01:34:23.907 --> 01:34:26.034
Where the sun goes at night.

918
01:34:26.743 --> 01:34:28.829
Why the moon changes shape.

919
01:34:33.584 --> 01:34:36.420
I want to know where the wind comes from.

920
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:45.554
The wind begins in a cave.

921
01:34:47.097 --> 01:34:50.684
Far to the north,
a young god sleeps in that cave.

922
01:34:51.935 --> 01:34:55.397
He dreams of a girl and he sighs,

923
01:34:56.857 --> 01:35:00.068
and the night wind stirs with his breath.

924
01:35:02.988 --> 01:35:04.615

What garrisons will we find there?

933

There are two legions in the garrison.
Some have been sent south...

Well, where is this slave general?

936
01:36:32.327 --> 01:36:34.413
Dionysius, get the litter bearers
out of the rain.

937
01:36:34.496 --> 01:36:37.207
Give them food, a bed and their freedom.

-DIONYSIUS: All right, follow me.
-We'll pay you for them.

939

We have no slaves in this camp.

940
01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:52.723
Tigranes Levantus at your service.

My credentials.

-Who are Isis and Serapis?
-Gods of the East.

Why should they want us to win?

954
01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:38.685
Because they favor Cilicia,

955
01:37:38.769 --> 01:37:41.938
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

01:37:46.234 --> 01:37:48.236
Would you like some wine?

01:37:48.779 --> 01:37:52.657

-Five hundred, at least.

-All?
-What is the price?

01:38:14.805 --> 01:38:19.017
Price is 100,000 sesterces per ship.

963
01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:23.313
For 500 ships, that would be

964

from now, we'll never be there.

Excellent workmanship.

01:39:46.688 --> 01:39:48.899
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

990
01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:52.068
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

991

I'm the son and grandson of slaves.

992
01:39:54.446 --> 01:39:57.282
I knew that, when I saw you couldn't read.

993
01:39:58.450 --> 01:40:02.204
Of course, it pleases Roman vanity
to think that you are noble.

994
01:40:02.245 --> 01:40:04.998
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves,

995
01:40:05.081 --> 01:40:07.292
especially a man like Crassus.

996
01:40:09.252 --> 01:40:13.673
-You know him?
-I entertained him one afternoon.

-In the arena.

-May I ask you something?
-You can ask.

Surely you know
you're going to lose, don't you?

1002
01:40:32.776 --> 01:40:34.110
You have no chance.

1003
01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:37.280
At this very moment,
six cohorts of the garrison of Rome

1004
01:40:37.322 --> 01:40:39.574

1005
01:40:42.077 --> 01:40:44.079
What are you going to do?

1006
01:40:49.125 --> 01:40:51.753

(LAUGHS)

1008
01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:58.093
Let me put it differently.

1009
01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.971
If you looked into a magic crystal

1010
01:41:01.805 --> 01:41:05.308
and you saw your army destroyed
and yourself dead,

1011
01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:10.855
if you saw that in the future,
as I'm sure you're seeing it now,

1012
01:41:11.314 --> 01:41:13.441
would you continue to fight?

1013
01:41:14.276 --> 01:41:15.318
Yes.

1014
01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.487
Knowing that you must lose?

1015
01:41:18.655 --> 01:41:20.323
Knowing we can't.

1016
01:41:21.825 --> 01:41:24.160
All men lose when they die.

1017
01:41:24.202 --> 01:41:28.248
And all men die, but a slave
and a free man lose different things.

1018
01:41:28.331 --> 01:41:30.125
They both lose life.

1019
01:41:30.166 --> 01:41:33.503
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

1020
01:41:34.504 --> 01:41:36.423
A slave loses his pain.

1021
01:41:38.466 --> 01:41:41.177
Death is the only freedom a slave knows.

1022
01:41:41.469 --> 01:41:43.847
That's why he's not afraid of it.

1023
01:41:45.849 --> 01:41:47.684
That's why we'll win.

1024
01:42:16.296 --> 01:42:18.715
Spartacus, that pirate was right.

1025
01:42:20.967 --> 01:42:23.970
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

1026
01:42:25.055 --> 01:42:27.724
-How many are there?
-About six cohorts.

1027
01:42:28.016 --> 01:42:29.142
Where?

1028
01:42:29.225 --> 01:42:31.895
CRIXUS: At the mouth of the valley,
against the cliffs.

1029
01:42:34.773 --> 01:42:38.068
-Strong camp?
-DIONYSIUS: They've built no stockade.

1030
01:42:40.028 --> 01:42:41.446
No stockade?

1031
01:42:41.905 --> 01:42:44.532
-Are you sure?
-I'm very sure.

1032
01:42:44.866 --> 01:42:47.535
This campaign is great sport for them.

1033

The Romans are having a picnic.

1034
01:42:50.038 --> 01:42:52.666
-Did they see you?
-No. We were hidden.

1035
01:42:56.044 --> 01:42:58.755
Maybe we ought to join this Roman picnic.

1036
01:42:58.838 --> 01:43:00.340
Form your men.

1037
01:43:06.262 --> 01:43:07.681
Six cohorts.

1038
01:43:08.932 --> 01:43:13.478
A lot of arms and weapons
to build our army with.

1039
01:43:41.423 --> 01:43:44.050
Crixus always wanted to march on Rome.

1040
01:43:45.093 --> 01:43:46.970
Now he doesn't have to.

02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.921
Come to Lidya for wine. That's the best.

1220
02:03:49.004 --> 02:03:50.839
MAN 3: The best wine comes from Greece.

1221
02:03:50.881 --> 02:03:53.091
MAN 4: Everybody knows that,
even the Romans!

1222
02:03:53.175 --> 02:03:54.843
No, Lidya!

1223
02:03:54.927 --> 02:03:58.305
(ALL CHATTERING)

1224
02:03:58.347 --> 02:03:59.431
You're all wrong!

1225
02:03:59.514 --> 02:04:01.725
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

1226
02:04:01.808 --> 02:04:03.101
I agree with you.

1227
02:04:25.374 --> 02:04:26.708
Gentlemen.

1228
02:04:27.793 --> 02:04:29.544
Any reports on Metapontum?

1229
02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.421
Heralds are crying the news now.

1230
02:04:31.505 --> 02:04:34.549
We lost 19,000 men,
including Commodius and his officers.

1231
02:04:34.591 --> 02:04:36.259
Nineteen thousand?

1232
02:04:38.887 --> 02:04:41.598
-Have you estates in Metapontum?
-No.

1233
02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:43.934
A son with Commodius.

1234
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:47.604
With your permission, good day.

1235
02:04:50.065 --> 02:04:53.568
We take five years to train a legion.

1236
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:57.864
How can this Spartacus train an army
in seven months?

1237
02:04:57.906 --> 02:05:00.742
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

1238
02:05:01.326 --> 02:05:04.454
-We should have an investigation.
-By all means, an investigation.

1239
02:05:04.538 --> 02:05:08.709
-Where is Spartacus now?
-He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.

1240
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:11.545
I need a few moments
of the Commander's time.

1241
02:05:11.586 --> 02:05:13.338
Will you excuse us?

1242
02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:23.098
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

1243
02:05:23.765 --> 02:05:25.809
Not a very splendid house.

1244
02:05:26.351 --> 02:05:29.104
And you feasted 11,000 plebeians
in the Field of Mars.

1245
02:05:29.187 --> 02:05:30.731
It scarcely could've been called a feast.

1246
02:05:30.772 --> 02:05:32.274
(TUT-TUTTING)

1247
02:05:32.441 --> 02:05:34.693
For 200 years,
your family and mine have been members

1248
02:05:34.776 --> 02:05:37.946
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party,

1249
02:05:37.988 --> 02:05:39.948
servants and rulers of Rome.

1250
02:05:41.074 --> 02:05:43.618
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

1251
02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:46.204
I've left no one, least of all Rome.

1252
02:05:46.788 --> 02:05:50.834
But this much I've learned from Gracchus,
Rome is the mob.

1253
02:05:50.917 --> 02:05:51.960
No!

1254
02:05:52.794 --> 02:05:55.797
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

1255
02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:59.092
I had no idea you'd grown religious.

1256
02:05:59.134 --> 02:06:01.219
(CHUCKLING) That doesn't matter.

1257
02:06:01.303 --> 02:06:03.972
If there were no gods at all, I'd revere them.

1258
02:06:04.014 --> 02:06:07.476
If there were no Rome, I'd dream of her

1259
02:06:07.517 --> 02:06:09.311
as I want you to do.

1260
02:06:10.812 --> 02:06:13.607
I want you to come back to your own kind.

1261
02:06:13.899 --> 02:06:15.358
I beg you to.

1262
02:06:16.485 --> 02:06:19.321
Is it me you want, or is it the garrison?

1263
02:06:19.613 --> 02:06:21.323
(LAUGHING) Both.

1264
02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.325
Tell me frankly.

1265
02:06:23.408 --> 02:06:26.495
If you were I,
would you take the field against Spartacus?

1266
02:06:26.536 --> 02:06:28.163
-Of course.
-Why?

1267
02:06:28.413 --> 02:06:30.749
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

1268
02:06:30.832 --> 02:06:32.542
Ah, Caesar!

1269
02:06:33.043 --> 02:06:34.419
Which Rome?

1270
02:06:34.795 --> 02:06:36.004
Theirs

1271
02:06:36.755 --> 02:06:38.006
or ours?

1272
02:06:41.802 --> 02:06:44.096
You know Gracchus is my friend.

1273
02:06:46.056 --> 02:06:47.808
I won't betray him.

1274
02:06:49.726 --> 02:06:50.936
Caesar?

1275
02:06:55.065 --> 02:06:57.818
Which is worse?
To betray a friend or betray Rome herself?

1276
02:06:57.859 --> 02:07:00.112
My dear Crassus, I face no such choice.

1277
02:07:00.195 --> 02:07:02.697
You will, sooner than you think.

1278
02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:07.869
GRACCHUS: Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you.

1279
02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:09.704
Your new master.

1280
02:07:12.582 --> 02:07:15.710
The Senate's been in session all day
over this business with Spartacus.

1281
02:07:15.752 --> 02:07:18.880
We've got eight legions
and no one to lead them.

1282
02:07:19.548 --> 02:07:21.299
The minute you offer
the general's command,

1283
02:07:21.383 --> 02:07:23.969
they start wheezing like winded mules.

1284
02:07:24.052 --> 02:07:26.388
I've seen such epidemics before,
haven't you?

1285
02:07:26.471 --> 02:07:28.557
-How's your health?
-Excellent, as you very well know.

1286
02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.268
I take it the Senate's now offering
the command to me.

1287
02:07:31.351 --> 02:07:33.770
-You've been expecting it.
-I have.

1288
02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:36.690
Have you thought how costly
my services might be?

1289
02:07:36.731 --> 02:07:38.191
We buy everything else these days.

1290
02:07:38.233 --> 02:07:40.360
No reason why
we shouldn't be charged for patriotism.

1291
02:07:40.402 --> 02:07:42.028
What's your fee?

1292
02:07:44.447 --> 02:07:48.743
My election as First Consul,
command of all the legions of Italy,

1293
02:07:49.327 --> 02:07:52.956
and the abolition of
senatorial authority over the courts.

1294
02:07:53.081 --> 02:07:54.583
Dictatorship.

1295
02:07:55.792 --> 02:07:56.960
Order.

1296
02:07:59.087 --> 02:08:02.215
-Let me know if my terms are acceptable.
-I can tell you now. They're unacceptable.

1297
02:08:02.257 --> 02:08:03.925
Yes, yes, I know.

1298
02:08:04.009 --> 02:08:07.429
For the present, perhaps,
but times change and so does the Senate.

1299
02:08:07.512 --> 02:08:09.347
When that day comes, I shall be ready.

1300
02:08:09.431 --> 02:08:12.601
-Convey my respects to your wife.
-With pleasure.

1301
02:08:15.103 --> 02:08:16.897
He's right, you know.

1302
02:08:16.938 --> 02:08:19.649
If something isn't done about Spartacus,
the Senate will change.

1303
02:08:19.733 --> 02:08:24.613
And Crassus will save Rome from
the slave army by assuming dictatorship.

1304
02:08:25.155 --> 02:08:26.489
(SIGHS)

1305
02:08:27.324 --> 02:08:30.452
But that depends on which way
Spartacus jumps.

1306
02:08:30.493 --> 02:08:32.287
Just now he's trying to get out of Italy.

1307
02:08:32.370 --> 02:08:35.165
If he succeeds, the crisis is over

1308
02:08:35.248 --> 02:08:38.335
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

1309
02:08:38.793 --> 02:08:41.963
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

1310
02:08:42.005 --> 02:08:43.256
What?

1311
02:08:43.632 --> 02:08:46.468
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

1312
02:08:46.551 --> 02:08:48.595
I've assured them that we won't interfere

1313
02:08:48.637 --> 02:08:52.182
if they transport Spartacus and his slaves
out of Italy.

1314
02:08:53.975 --> 02:08:56.311
So now we (SIGHING) deal with pirates.

1315
02:08:56.937 --> 02:08:58.688
We bargain with criminals.

1316
02:08:58.772 --> 02:09:02.984
Don't be so stiff-necked.
Politics is a practical profession.

1317
02:09:03.026 --> 02:09:06.655
If a criminal has what you want,
you do business with him.

1318
02:09:43.525 --> 02:09:45.860
How far are we from Brundusium?

1319
02:09:46.403 --> 02:09:47.946
About 20 miles.

1320
02:09:49.155 --> 02:09:52.867
Our army will camp here tonight.
They're six hours behind us.

1321
02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:57.163
Patullus, ride ahead to Brundusium.
Bring Tigranes here.

1322
02:09:57.205 --> 02:10:00.166
Marco, report back to Spartacus.

1323
02:10:00.208 --> 02:10:02.752
Tell him we camp tonight by the seal

1324

(PEOPLE CLAPPING IN RHYTHM)

1327
02:10:44.586 --> 02:10:46.588
If all goes well,

1328
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:48.798
we can load 150 ships a day.

1329
02:10:48.882 --> 02:10:51.760
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

1330
02:10:51.801 --> 02:10:55.764
-That ought to keep him busy.
-Saves me finding some place to sleep.

1331
02:10:55.805 --> 02:10:59.809
-Crixus, keep giving me reports on Pompey.
-There won't be any surprises.

1332
02:10:59.893 --> 02:11:03.563
I still want patrols up to the time
we call them to board ship.

1333
02:11:03.605 --> 02:11:05.565
-I'll get them together.
-Spartacus,

1334
02:11:05.607 --> 02:11:08.568
the harbor district in Brundusium
has food warehouses,

1335
02:11:08.610 --> 02:11:11.196
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

1336
02:11:11.279 --> 02:11:15.033
-The countryside's filled with cattle.
-We've salt to preserve them.

1337
02:11:15.116 --> 02:11:16.451
I'll handle it.

1338
02:11:17.118 --> 02:11:20.955
Oh, find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

1339
02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:22.707
Tigranes Levantus.

1340
02:11:23.124 --> 02:11:24.459
Ah!

1341
02:11:25.710 --> 02:11:28.004
-My dear General.
-Welcome, Tigranes.

1342
02:11:28.546 --> 02:11:32.592
No, no. You needn't look for litter bearers
to emancipate. I rode a horse.

1343
02:11:32.634 --> 02:11:35.762

02:11:44.187 --> 02:11:47.273
I bear a heavy burden of evil tidings.

What is it?

1348
02:11:53.655 --> 02:11:56.699
Pompey and his army has landed in Italy.

1349
02:11:57.158 --> 02:11:59.828
At the port of Rhegium three days ago.

1350
02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:02.163
We get complete reports
on their movements.

that a Roman fleet
carrying Lucullus and his army

1353

arrives tomorrow at Brundusium?

1354
02:12:11.923 --> 02:12:14.884
-SPARTACUS: Lucullus, here?
-You have no ships.

1355
02:12:18.805 --> 02:12:20.849
I saw them in the harbor.

1356
02:12:22.434 --> 02:12:26.229
The Cilician fleet, out of strategic necessity,

1357
02:12:26.312 --> 02:12:29.023
has been obliged to withdraw.

1358
02:12:30.233 --> 02:12:33.403
-Withdraw?
-There are no ships at all?

1359
02:12:41.911 --> 02:12:45.748
Cilician pirates can destroy any Roman fleet
that ever sailed.

1360
02:12:46.541 --> 02:12:49.085
If they run away now,
it's not because they're afraid!

You better give me a better reason.

1362
02:12:50.545 --> 02:12:52.672
I'm as desolated as you are, General.

02:12:52.714 --> 02:12:54.382

You'll cut the skin.

1367
02:13:03.057 --> 02:13:05.393
Why did the Cilicians run away?

1368
02:13:05.685 --> 02:13:07.228
They were paid.

1369
02:13:08.104 --> 02:13:11.024
And who paid them? Who?

1370
02:13:12.108 --> 02:13:13.359
Crassus.

02:13:14.194 --> 02:13:15.612
(GASPS)

1372
02:13:17.071 --> 02:13:18.323
Crassus.

1373
02:13:19.574 --> 02:13:21.868
Crassus won't fight us himself.

1374
02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:25.121
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

1375
02:13:25.497 --> 02:13:28.666
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

1376
02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:29.918
I don't know.

1377
02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:34.172
How can I answer, when there is no answer?
I've been betrayed just as you have.

1378
02:13:34.255 --> 02:13:35.965
There is an answer.

1379
02:13:37.217 --> 02:13:39.844
There must be an answer to everything.

1380
02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:43.264
Five miles from Brundusium.

1381
02:13:45.433 --> 02:13:46.976
Here's Rhegium.

1382
02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:51.356
Pompey's march
must've brought him to about here.

1383
02:13:51.439 --> 02:13:54.067
He's four days away, maybe more.

1384
02:13:55.777 --> 02:13:58.446
Lucullus lands at Brundusium tomorrow.

1385
02:13:58.988 --> 02:14:01.115
If we engage Lucullus,

1386
02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:04.285
Pompey will have time
to march against our rear.

1387
02:14:05.787 --> 02:14:08.122
If we turn west to meet Pompey,

1388
02:14:09.958 --> 02:14:12.544
Lucullus will march against our rear.

1389
02:14:13.878 --> 02:14:18.216
The only other army in all of Italy is here.

1390
02:14:18.591 --> 02:14:19.676
Rome.

1391
02:14:20.843 --> 02:14:22.512
Yes, of course!

1392
02:14:23.012 --> 02:14:25.890
Crassus is inviting us to march on Rome,

1393
02:14:25.974 --> 02:14:28.268
so he can take the field against us.

1394
02:14:28.768 --> 02:14:31.646
-Crassus wants us to march on Rome?
-He's forcing us to.

1395
02:14:31.688 --> 02:14:36.401
He knows I won't let myself be trapped
between two armies with my back to the sea.

1396
02:14:36.484 --> 02:14:39.112
He knows my only other choice is Rome.

1397
02:14:40.655 --> 02:14:42.865
Somewhere on the way, we meet.

1398
02:14:43.533 --> 02:14:46.536
If he beats us,
he becomes the savior of Rome,

1399
02:14:46.619 --> 02:14:48.830
and there's his final victory over the Senate.

1400
02:14:48.913 --> 02:14:53.501
General, allow me
to redeem myself in your eyes.

1401
02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:55.503
For a small commission,

1402
02:14:55.587 --> 02:15:00.550
I can arrange for you, your family
and your leaders, of course,

1403
02:15:00.633 --> 02:15:03.845
to be smuggled out of Italy and transported
to one of the eastern countries

1404
02:15:03.928 --> 02:15:06.723
where men like you are welcome
and appreciated.

1405
02:15:06.806 --> 02:15:09.684
You can live like kings
for the rest of your lives.

1406
02:15:09.767 --> 02:15:11.853
What do you think, General?

1407
02:15:12.186 --> 02:15:13.438
Go away.

1408
02:15:15.231 --> 02:15:16.482
Go away?

1409
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:21.321
Go away.

1410
02:15:30.371 --> 02:15:32.915
Tell the trumpeters to sound assembly.

1411
02:15:40.882 --> 02:15:44.886
Tonight, a Roman army lands
in the harbor of Brundusium.

1412
02:15:46.137 --> 02:15:49.057
Another army is approaching us
from the west.

1413
02:15:49.307 --> 02:15:53.561
Between them, they hope to trap us here,
against the sea.

1414
02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:57.732
The Cilician pirates have betrayed us.
We have no ships.

1415
02:15:57.857 --> 02:16:00.360
"By order of the Senate,

1416
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:04.739
"be it known that we have this day elected

1417
02:16:04.781 --> 02:16:07.575
"Marcus Licinius Crassus

1418
02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:10.536
"First Consul of the Republic

1419
02:16:10.578 --> 02:16:14.791
"and Commander-in-Chief
of the armies of Rome."

1420
02:16:15.208 --> 02:16:17.627
PEOPLE: Hail Crassus!

1421
02:16:18.294 --> 02:16:22.048
Rome will not allow us to escape from Italy.

1422
02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:26.928
We have no choice
but to march against Rome herself

1423
02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:30.932
and end this war
the only way it could have ended.

1424
02:16:31.599 --> 02:16:35.186
By freeing every slave in Italy.

1425
02:16:35.561 --> 02:16:39.190
I promise you a new Rome,

1426
02:16:40.233 --> 02:16:42.694
a new Italy and a new empire.

1427
02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:46.864
I promise the destruction of the slave army

1428
02:16:46.948 --> 02:16:51.911
and the restoration of order
throughout all our territories.

1429
02:16:52.453 --> 02:16:56.040
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers,

1430
02:16:56.624 --> 02:16:59.585
facing a long march and a hard fight,

1431
02:16:59.669 --> 02:17:02.922
than to be the richest citizen of Rome,

1432
02:17:03.339 --> 02:17:05.967
fat with food he didn't work for,

1433
02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:08.469
and surrounded by slaves.

1434
02:17:08.803 --> 02:17:11.472
I promise the living body of Spartacus

1435
02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:14.976
for whatever punishment you may deem fit.

1436
02:17:15.643 --> 02:17:18.146
That, or his head.

1437
02:17:19.939 --> 02:17:23.317
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

1438
02:17:24.527 --> 02:17:26.320
This I have sworn

1439
02:17:27.321 --> 02:17:29.991
in the temple that guards their bones.

1440
02:17:31.617 --> 02:17:33.870
ALL: Hail Crassus!

1441
02:17:34.287 --> 02:17:36.581
We've traveled a long ways together.

1442
02:17:37.331 --> 02:17:41.502
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

1443
02:17:42.253 --> 02:17:46.174
Now instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea,

1444
02:17:47.049 --> 02:17:49.177
we must fight again.

1445
02:17:50.303 --> 02:17:54.891
Maybe there's no peace in this world,
for us or for anyone else.

1446
02:17:54.974 --> 02:17:56.350
I don't know.

1447
02:17:57.393 --> 02:18:01.355
But I do know that as long as we live,

1448
02:18:02.064 --> 02:18:04.525
we must stay true to ourselves.

1449
02:18:06.652 --> 02:18:08.863
I do know that we're brothers.

1450
02:18:09.739 --> 02:18:11.866
And I know that we're free.

1451
02:18:19.081 --> 02:18:20.374
We march tonight!

1452
02:19:54.427 --> 02:19:56.304
-Hail Crassus!
-Hail Crassus!

1453
02:19:57.305 --> 02:19:59.181
Greetings to you, Crassus.

1454
02:19:59.265 --> 02:20:01.809
Caius. Gentlemen.

1455
02:20:03.185 --> 02:20:04.979
Have your dispositions been made?

1456
02:20:05.021 --> 02:20:09.191
Each maniple knows its position, sir,
and exactly what's expected.

1457
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:13.154
Every legion commander
has been given his battle orders.

1458
02:20:13.613 --> 02:20:16.324
Excellent.
All positions will now be changed.

1459
02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:17.658
Changed?

1460
02:20:18.492 --> 02:20:22.121
Spartacus takes too keen an interest
in our plans, I fear.

1461
02:20:22.955 --> 02:20:26.167
New battle orders will be issued
in a short while.

1462
02:20:29.003 --> 02:20:32.965
Spartacus has every reason to believe
that he has outdistanced

1463
02:20:33.007 --> 02:20:35.843
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and Lucullus.

1464
02:20:36.636 --> 02:20:41.557
However, there are passes through the
Apennine Mountains unknown to any map.

1465
02:20:43.684 --> 02:20:47.396
It may fortify your courage to know

1466
02:20:48.064 --> 02:20:51.692
that Pompey is encamped
some 20 miles to the west

1467
02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.321
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south

1468
02:20:55.363 --> 02:20:57.365
by forced night march.

1469
02:20:57.406 --> 02:21:01.619
Sir, allow us to pledge you
the most glorious victory of your career.

1470
02:21:01.702 --> 02:21:02.745
-Aye!
-Aye!

1471
02:21:03.621 --> 02:21:05.414
I'm not after glory!

1472
02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:08.376
I'm after Spartacus.

1473
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:12.213
And, gentlemen, I mean to have him.

1474
02:21:13.714 --> 02:21:17.134
However, this campaign is not alone
to kill Spartacus.

1475
02:21:18.177 --> 02:21:20.805
It is to kill the legend of Spartacus.

1476
02:21:23.224 --> 02:21:25.017
You may go, gentlemen.

1477
02:21:25.059 --> 02:21:27.228
-Hail Crassus.
-Hail Crassus.

1478
02:21:29.855 --> 02:21:32.066
Lentulus Batiatus awaits Your Excellency.

1479
02:21:32.108 --> 02:21:34.110
-Who?
-The lanista, sir.

1480
02:21:34.777 --> 02:21:36.862
Ah! Admit him.

1481
02:21:40.199 --> 02:21:41.450
Most Blessed Highness,

1482
02:21:41.534 --> 02:21:44.954
as soon as I received your message
I hurried into your distinguished presence.

1483
02:21:45.037 --> 02:21:48.082
I'm glad you were able to spare the time.
Sit down.

1484
02:21:48.165 --> 02:21:50.209
Oh, how gracious.

1485
02:21:51.711 --> 02:21:54.088
I understand... I'm informed

1486
02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:57.258
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

1487
02:21:57.299 --> 02:21:58.384
Yes!

1488
02:21:58.426 --> 02:22:02.346
In fact, if it isn't too subversive to say so,

1489
02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:04.890
I made him what he is today.

1490
02:22:05.516 --> 02:22:07.601
You're to be congratulated.

1491
02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:11.272
You're so admirably qualified

1492
02:22:11.814 --> 02:22:14.734
to give me what up to now
I've not been able to obtain,

1493
02:22:14.775 --> 02:22:16.736
a physical description of Spartacus.

1494
02:22:16.777 --> 02:22:18.029
Oh, yes.

1495
02:22:19.905 --> 02:22:21.490
But you saw him.

1496
02:22:22.575 --> 02:22:24.285
-What?
-In the ring.

1497
02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:27.204
When?

1498
02:22:27.955 --> 02:22:31.584
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

1499
02:22:33.502 --> 02:22:34.628
What?

1500
02:22:35.629 --> 02:22:37.923
I trust they're both in good health.

1501
02:22:37.965 --> 02:22:41.093
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the negro.

1502
02:22:41.135 --> 02:22:42.595
I remember the negro.

1503
02:22:42.636 --> 02:22:46.265
You had good cause to. If I... If I may say so,

1504
02:22:46.807 --> 02:22:49.435
a brilliant dagger thrust, difficult angle.

1505
02:22:49.477 --> 02:22:51.896
-Spartacus was the opponent?
-Yes.

1506
02:22:54.148 --> 02:22:55.983
What did he look like?

1507
02:22:56.817 --> 02:22:59.361
That's a matter of some importance
to Your Highness?

1508
02:22:59.445 --> 02:23:03.282
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

1509
02:23:04.533 --> 02:23:08.329
We're both Roman patriots.
You're a great one. I, of course, smaller.

1510
02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:10.956
We both believe in Roman fair play.

1511
02:23:11.749 --> 02:23:13.000
You want something from me.

1512
02:23:13.084 --> 02:23:16.629
I would be lacking
in respect for my conscience,

1513
02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:18.923
if I did not say
that I wish something from you.

1514
02:23:19.006 --> 02:23:20.341
Name your price.

1515
02:23:21.300 --> 02:23:23.135
If... No.

1516
02:23:23.552 --> 02:23:26.180
When you win your victory tomorrow,

1517
02:23:26.639 --> 02:23:29.100
presumably the survivors will be
auctioned off

1518
02:23:29.183 --> 02:23:32.853
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

1519
02:23:33.771 --> 02:23:36.190
Could not the agent for that sale

1520
02:23:36.232 --> 02:23:40.444
be he who shares this tiny moment
of history with Your Honor?

1521
02:23:42.696 --> 02:23:46.534
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

1522
02:23:47.201 --> 02:23:49.912
In return, you will remain here

1523
02:23:49.995 --> 02:23:52.665
until after the battle and aid me
in identifying Spartacus.

1524
02:23:52.706 --> 02:23:54.250
After the battle?

1525
02:23:54.333 --> 02:23:56.919
You misunderstand me. I'm a civilian.

1526
02:23:57.211 --> 02:24:00.673
I'm even more of a civilian
than most civilians.

1527
02:24:01.423 --> 02:24:03.217
If you wish to remain so,

1528
02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:07.805
I strongly advise you to stay here
and be our guest. Guard!

1529
02:24:07.888 --> 02:24:09.223
(STUTTERING)

1530
02:24:10.933 --> 02:24:12.476
Hmm?

1531
02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:18.440
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus,

1532
02:24:19.567 --> 02:24:23.821
what if it is Spartacus who crosses
the battlefield looking for you?

1533
02:24:26.157 --> 02:24:30.536
In such circumstances,
I have no doubt you will be helping him.

1534
02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:34.790
This fellow remains with us
until after the battle.

1535
02:24:34.874 --> 02:24:38.169
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.

1536
02:26:11.512 --> 02:26:13.931
GIRL: Mommy? Mommy?

1537
02:26:16.892 --> 02:26:18.936
When do we go home?

1538
02:26:23.857 --> 02:26:25.526
Go to sleep, dear.

1539
02:26:59.643 --> 02:27:01.103
No pains yet?

1540
02:27:01.645 --> 02:27:04.356
He's a bad child. He hits me with his fists.

1541
02:27:04.398 --> 02:27:07.401
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?

1542
02:27:07.735 --> 02:27:09.361
Can you feel it?

1543
02:27:11.113 --> 02:27:12.531
No, I don't.

1544
02:27:13.073 --> 02:27:15.576
I hope he waits till we get to Rome.

1545
02:27:19.455 --> 02:27:20.581
Rome.

1546
02:27:22.708 --> 02:27:24.835
They've never beaten us yet.

1547
02:27:27.421 --> 02:27:28.422
No.

1548
02:27:31.342 --> 02:27:32.968
But no matter how many times
we beat them,

1549
02:27:33.052 --> 02:27:37.181
they still seem to have another army
to send against us.

1550
02:27:38.265 --> 02:27:39.641
And another.

1551
02:27:42.770 --> 02:27:46.065
Varinia, it just seems like
we've started something

1552
02:27:47.816 --> 02:27:49.610
that has no ending.

1553
02:27:49.651 --> 02:27:52.780
If it ended tomorrow, it would be worth it.

1554
02:27:58.494 --> 02:27:59.912
Oh, Varinia,

1555
02:28:00.329 --> 02:28:01.622
(SIGHING)

1556
02:28:02.331 --> 02:28:04.083
Don't make me weak.

1557
02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:07.378
You're strong enough to be weak.

Oh, Varinia.

02:28:12.883 --> 02:28:15.094
I love you more than my life.

Yet, sometimes,
even with you sleeping beside me

1562
02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:24.812
I feel so alone.

1563
02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:31.318
I imagine a god for slaves and I pray.

1564
02:28:33.153 --> 02:28:34.947
What do you pray for?

1565
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:39.618
I pray for a son who'll be born free.

1566
02:28:41.495 --> 02:28:43.539
I pray for the same thing.

1567
02:28:48.836 --> 02:28:51.004
Take care of my son, Varinia.

1568
02:28:52.506 --> 02:28:54.425
And if he never knows me,

1569
02:28:54.508 --> 02:28:57.803
tell him who I was and what we dreamed of.

1570
02:28:58.846 --> 02:29:01.723
Tell him the truth.
There will be others to tell him lies.

Marcus Licinius Crassus,

But the terrible penalty of crucifixion
has been set aside

1599

that you identify the body

At least here is someone worth selling,
Your Enormity.

1633

I'll even take the child as an investment.

-How many women have been taken?
-Under 40, sir.

1635
02:43:05.441 --> 02:43:08.528
Those who weren't killed have run off
to the hills with their children.

1636
02:43:08.611 --> 02:43:10.822
You may sell all the others
but not this woman.

1637
02:43:10.863 --> 02:43:14.575
You haven't seen the others.
They're of surpassing ugliness!

1638
02:43:14.659 --> 02:43:16.202
A genius wouldn't be able to sell them.

are to be conveyed to my house in Rome.

02:44:27.357 --> 02:44:29.025
And that man, too.

-March on.
-March on!

1649
02:45:31.754 --> 02:45:34.424
I've more stripes than a zebra.

1650
02:45:34.674 --> 02:45:39.762
Every time I touch my wounds,
they sing like larks.

1651
02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:45.393
But in spite of that, I found something
I never had before, with all my wealth.

1652
02:45:45.476 --> 02:45:46.727
What is that?

1653
02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:50.690
Don't laugh at me,
but I believe it to be dignity.

1654
02:45:51.023 --> 02:45:55.236
In Rome, dignity shortens life
even more surely than disease.

1655
02:45:55.570 --> 02:45:58.823
The gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise.

1656
02:45:58.865 --> 02:46:00.366
You think so?

1657
02:46:00.783 --> 02:46:04.579
Anyone who believes
I'll turn informer for nothing is a fool.

1658
02:46:05.329 --> 02:46:07.874
I bore the whip without complaint.

1659
02:46:07.957 --> 02:46:11.502
Indeed, that sounds like
a bad attack of dignity.

1660
02:46:11.961 --> 02:46:14.547
I hope this will not deflect you

1661
02:46:14.589 --> 02:46:16.841
from the revenge
you were going to take on Crassus.

1662
02:46:16.883 --> 02:46:19.469
On the contrary,
it only strengthens my resolve.

1663
02:46:19.552 --> 02:46:22.221
-That's enough.
-I'm glad to learn that.

1664
02:46:24.474 --> 02:46:28.269
This woman, Varinia, is in his house.
All Rome knows about it.

1665
02:46:28.352 --> 02:46:32.982
Malicious tongues even say
that he's in love for the first time.

1666
02:46:33.774 --> 02:46:35.735
Yes! Oh!

1667
02:46:37.028 --> 02:46:40.698
I noticed a strange look in his eye
when he first saw her.

1668
02:46:40.907 --> 02:46:45.786
It would take a great woman to make
Crassus fall out of love with himself.

1669
02:46:46.412 --> 02:46:47.955
I'll be honest with you.

1670
02:46:48.039 --> 02:46:51.501
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

1671
02:46:51.584 --> 02:46:54.921
Dignity and honesty in one afternoon.
I hardly recognize you.

1672
02:46:56.088 --> 02:46:57.798
But she is an impossible woman.

1673
02:46:57.882 --> 02:47:01.093
-Beautiful?
-Beautiful? Well, beautiful.

1674
02:47:01.385 --> 02:47:04.180
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

1675
02:47:04.263 --> 02:47:06.265
-Proud?
-Proud, proud.

1676
02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:11.270
You feel that she would surrender
to the right man which is irritating.

1677
02:47:12.271 --> 02:47:14.482
I like Crassus.

1678
02:47:14.565 --> 02:47:18.569
Let's save him from his agony.
Let's steal this woman.

1679
02:47:19.654 --> 02:47:22.073
Steal the woman? Why?

1680
02:47:22.114 --> 02:47:24.534
I can no longer hurt Crassus in the Senate

1681
02:47:24.617 --> 02:47:28.329
but I can hurt him
where he'll feel it most, in his pride.

1682
02:47:28.412 --> 02:47:30.581
Attack our enemy from within.

1683
02:47:30.623 --> 02:47:33.376
The scheme is excellent,
but I hope you're not suggesting

1684
02:47:33.459 --> 02:47:36.796
-that I steal the woman.
-Yes!

1685
02:47:38.047 --> 02:47:41.217
Buy some horses and a cart with a canopy.

1686
02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:43.427
Bring her here by nightfall.

1687
02:47:43.636 --> 02:47:44.971
Oh, no.

1688
02:47:45.221 --> 02:47:48.849
Add courage to your newfound virtues.

1689
02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:54.814
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

1690
02:47:57.149 --> 02:47:59.318
Half a million? Mmm-hmm.

1691
02:48:01.988 --> 02:48:04.448
Well, Crassus

1692
02:48:04.490 --> 02:48:08.035
does seem to dwindle in the mind, but...

1693
02:48:08.327 --> 02:48:11.664
Let's reduce him further. A round million!

1694
02:48:12.331 --> 02:48:13.666
A million.

1695
02:48:14.542 --> 02:48:17.545
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

1696
02:48:18.004 --> 02:48:19.547

This time you've come to teach.

You've joined Crassus?

1704
02:48:51.370 --> 02:48:53.372
-Am I arrested?
-No.

1705
02:48:53.748 --> 02:48:57.543
But I must ask you to come with me
to the Senate immediately.

1706
02:48:58.794 --> 02:49:03.215
What I do, I do not for myself but for Rome.

1707
02:49:03.257 --> 02:49:06.552
Rome? Poor, helpless Rome.

1708
02:49:07.428 --> 02:49:11.432
Let's go and hear more about Rome
from Crassus.

1709
02:49:16.687 --> 02:49:19.106
Did you truly believe 500 years of Rome

1710
02:49:19.190 --> 02:49:22.735
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

1711
02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:30.368
Already the bodies of 6,000 crucified slaves

1712
02:49:30.409 --> 02:49:32.203
line the Appian Way.

1713
02:49:32.828 --> 02:49:35.790
Tomorrow the last of their companions
will fight to the death

1714
02:49:35.873 --> 02:49:39.377
in the temple of my fathers,
as a sacrifice to them.

1715
02:49:39.919 --> 02:49:43.631
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble

1716
02:49:43.714 --> 02:49:48.594
if they falter one instant in loyalty
to the new order.

1717
02:49:49.387 --> 02:49:51.639
The enemies of the state are known.

1718
02:49:52.098 --> 02:49:55.851
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

1719
02:49:56.268 --> 02:50:00.064
In every city and province,
lists of the disloyal have been compiled.

1720
02:50:00.856 --> 02:50:05.444
Tomorrow they will learn the cost
of their terrible folly,

1721
02:50:07.113 --> 02:50:08.614
their treason.

1722
02:50:09.615 --> 02:50:13.994
Where does my name appear on the list
of disloyal enemies of the state?

1723
02:50:15.121 --> 02:50:16.288
CRASSUS: First.

1724
02:50:18.666 --> 02:50:22.086
Yet, upon you
I have no desire for vengeance.

1725
02:50:23.129 --> 02:50:25.631
Your property shall not be touched.

1726
02:50:25.798 --> 02:50:29.093
You will retain the rank and title
of Roman senator.

1727
02:50:29.427 --> 02:50:30.636
A house...

1728
02:50:31.595 --> 02:50:35.141
A farmhouse in Picenum
has been provided for your exile.

1729
02:50:35.850 --> 02:50:38.269
You may take your women with you.

1730
02:50:39.645 --> 02:50:43.816
Why am I to be left so conspicuously alive?

1731
02:50:44.608 --> 02:50:47.653
Your followers are deluded enough
to trust you.

1732
02:50:47.737 --> 02:50:51.490
I intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for the sake of their own good,

1733
02:50:51.574 --> 02:50:54.577
their peaceful and profitable future.

1734
02:50:55.161 --> 02:50:58.664
From time to time thereafter, I may
find it useful to bring you back to Rome

1735
02:50:58.748 --> 02:51:00.833
to continue your duty to her,

1736
02:51:00.875 --> 02:51:05.254
to calm the envious spirit
and the troubled mind.

1737
02:51:05.921 --> 02:51:10.843
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order,

1738
02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:13.512
and trust the gods!

1739
02:51:17.641 --> 02:51:19.018
You may go.

1740
02:51:30.488 --> 02:51:31.906
Halt!

1741
02:51:45.711 --> 02:51:47.505
(SLAVES SCREAMING)

1742
02:51:48.047 --> 02:51:49.423
(HAMMERING)

1743
02:52:18.244 --> 02:52:20.579
Why hide behind that stola?

1744
02:52:26.418 --> 02:52:27.920
That's better.

1745
02:52:28.462 --> 02:52:31.423
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

1746
02:52:32.007 --> 02:52:36.470
You, above all people, should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly.

1747
02:52:36.554 --> 02:52:37.888
Come here.

1748
02:52:52.820 --> 02:52:57.283
This belonged to a queen,
the Queen of Persia.

1749
02:52:58.951 --> 02:53:00.286
It's heavy.

1750
02:53:02.621 --> 02:53:05.332
In time you will wear it lightly enough.

1751
02:53:18.470 --> 02:53:19.722
Sit down.

1752
02:53:23.350 --> 02:53:26.520
Will you have some squab and honey?

1753
02:53:28.022 --> 02:53:29.189
No.

1754
02:53:29.815 --> 02:53:31.150
You'll enjoy it.

1755
02:53:32.943 --> 02:53:34.737
And a piece of melon?

1756
02:53:39.366 --> 02:53:41.368
And some wine, of course.

1757
02:53:43.329 --> 02:53:44.455
Eat.

1758
02:53:49.084 --> 02:53:50.461
(CHUCKLES)

1759
02:53:50.502 --> 02:53:54.131
I did not command you to eat, I invited you.

1760
02:53:56.342 --> 02:54:00.721
You find the richness of your surroundings
makes conversation difficult?

1761
02:54:01.305 --> 02:54:02.348
Hmm?

1762
02:54:03.682 --> 02:54:05.184
Why am I here?

1763
02:54:06.352 --> 02:54:07.686
(CHUCKLES)

1764
02:54:09.104 --> 02:54:10.606
Good question.

1765
02:54:11.607 --> 02:54:13.359
A woman's question.

1766
02:54:14.526 --> 02:54:18.030
I wish the answer could be as good
and straightforward.

1767
02:54:20.908 --> 02:54:23.702
Mmm. The infant, it thrives?

1768
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:26.038
He thrives.

1769
02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:30.709
I purchased a wet nurse for him, yesterday.
I hope the milk agrees with him.

1770
02:54:33.379 --> 02:54:34.964
I sent her away.

1771
02:54:35.798 --> 02:54:38.300
I prefer to nurse the child myself.

1772
02:54:39.385 --> 02:54:41.261
I'm not sure I approve.

1773
02:54:42.930 --> 02:54:45.057
It ties you to the old life.

1774
02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:49.186
I want you to begin
to look forward to the new.

1775
02:54:51.939 --> 02:54:54.483
I don't care about my new life here.

1776
02:54:55.317 --> 02:54:58.487
You care about the life of your child,
don't you?

1777
02:54:59.488 --> 02:55:02.032
Why do you threaten me with my baby?

1778
02:55:02.616 --> 02:55:05.577
I belong to you.
You can take me anytime you wish.

1779
02:55:05.661 --> 02:55:08.330
But I don't want to take you.

1780
02:55:09.581 --> 02:55:11.291
I want you to give.

1781
02:55:14.169 --> 02:55:16.213
I want your love, Varinia.

1782
02:55:19.758 --> 02:55:23.887
You think by threatening to kill my child
you'll make me love you?

1783
02:55:24.179 --> 02:55:27.266
I did not threaten to kill your child.

1784
02:55:34.481 --> 02:55:37.443
I'm sorry, Varinia.

1785
02:55:44.074 --> 02:55:46.285
One shouldn't grieve forever.

1786
02:55:47.453 --> 02:55:50.497
I'm not grieving, I'm remembering.

1787
02:55:51.498 --> 02:55:53.959
Do I interfere with your memories?

1788
02:55:55.294 --> 02:55:56.503
Oh, no.

1789
02:55:56.837 --> 02:55:58.130
(SCOFFS)

1790
02:55:59.423 --> 02:56:04.178
You tread the ridge between truth and insult
with the skill of a mountain goat.

1791
02:56:04.595 --> 02:56:05.679
Well.

1792
02:56:08.057 --> 02:56:11.435
What do you remember,
when you think about Spartacus?

1793
02:56:13.896 --> 02:56:17.149
-It doesn't distress you to talk about him?
-No.

1794
02:56:19.234 --> 02:56:20.611
Well, then,

1795
02:56:22.738 --> 02:56:27.034
what sort of a man was he, really?

1796
02:56:32.247 --> 02:56:36.418
He was a man who began all alone,
like an animal.

1797
02:56:37.878 --> 02:56:39.379
Yet on the day he died,

1798
02:56:39.463 --> 02:56:43.175
thousands and thousands
would gladly have died in his place.

1799
02:56:43.842 --> 02:56:44.927
(CHUCKLES)

1800
02:56:45.010 --> 02:56:47.679
What was he? Was he a god?

1801
02:56:49.181 --> 02:56:50.808
He wasn't a god.

1802
02:56:52.017 --> 02:56:55.562
He was a simple man. A slave.

1803
02:56:59.691 --> 02:57:01.068
I loved him.

1804
02:57:01.777 --> 02:57:04.238
He was an outlaw! A murderer!

1805
02:57:04.321 --> 02:57:08.033
An enemy to everything fine and decent
that Rome ever built!

1806
02:57:08.992 --> 02:57:10.869
Damn you! You tell me.

1807
02:57:11.745 --> 02:57:14.498
-Why did you love him?
-I can't tell you.

1808
02:57:15.165 --> 02:57:18.335
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

1809
02:57:19.711 --> 02:57:22.256
But I want to understand.

1810
02:57:23.215 --> 02:57:27.010
Don't you see? I must understand.

1811
02:57:35.853 --> 02:57:38.230
You're afraid of him, aren't you?

1812
02:57:42.609 --> 02:57:44.736
That's why you want his wife,

1813
02:57:45.404 --> 02:57:48.448
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

1814
02:57:50.784 --> 02:57:54.413
When you're so afraid, nothing can help.

1815
02:57:55.247 --> 02:57:56.498
Nothing.

1816
02:58:05.299 --> 02:58:06.758
We shall see.

1817
02:58:31.533 --> 02:58:33.744
Could we have won, Spartacus?

1818
02:58:36.038 --> 02:58:37.956
Could we ever have won?

1819
02:58:42.586 --> 02:58:45.297
Just by fighting them, we won something.

1820
02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:51.428
When just one man says "No, I won't,"

1821
02:58:52.137 --> 02:58:53.931
Rome begins to fear.

1822
02:58:59.353 --> 02:59:01.980
We were tens of thousands who said no.

1823
02:59:03.106 --> 02:59:05.150
That was the wonder of it.

1824
02:59:05.984 --> 02:59:09.238
To have seen slaves
lift their heads from the dust,

1825
02:59:11.949 --> 02:59:16.620
to see them rise from their knees, stand tall

1826
02:59:19.414 --> 02:59:21.416
with a song on their lips,

1827
02:59:23.252 --> 02:59:24.670
to hear them

1828
02:59:26.213 --> 02:59:29.591
storm through the mountains shouting,

1829
02:59:32.219 --> 02:59:34.721
to hear them sing along the plains.

1830
02:59:38.475 --> 02:59:40.269
And now they're dead.

1831
02:59:43.230 --> 02:59:44.356
Dead.

1832
02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:52.489
Varinia

1833
02:59:56.368 --> 02:59:57.452
dead.

1834
03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:03.250
And the baby.

1835
03:00:16.888 --> 03:00:18.265
All of them.

1836
03:00:29.484 --> 03:00:31.903
Are you afraid to die, Spartacus?

1837
03:00:32.946 --> 03:00:34.031
Hmm.

1838
03:00:35.073 --> 03:00:37.367
No more than I was to be born.

1839
03:00:48.670 --> 03:00:50.213
Are you afraid?

1840
03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:54.885
Yes.

1841
03:01:08.065 --> 03:01:09.441
Hail Consul!

1842
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:11.777
Guard, fall in.

1843
03:01:12.819 --> 03:01:15.655
-CRASSUS: Where are the gladiators?
-Over there, sir.

1844
03:01:40.138 --> 03:01:43.934
Antoninus, the night passes slowly,
doesn't it?

1845
03:01:55.529 --> 03:01:56.863
Spartacus.

1846
03:02:02.744 --> 03:02:06.873
You are he, aren't you?

1847
03:02:10.335 --> 03:02:14.131
Gladiator, I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

1848
03:02:17.717 --> 03:02:21.888
You must answer when I speak to you.

1849
03:02:29.312 --> 03:02:30.689
(SCREAMING)

1850
03:02:45.454 --> 03:02:46.788
Centurion!

1851
03:02:49.875 --> 03:02:53.545
Let them fight now. Unchain them.

1852
03:02:53.753 --> 03:02:58.049
The entire city's been told they'll fight
tomorrow in the temple of your ancestors.

1853
03:02:58.133 --> 03:03:01.136
They will fight now for me. Here!

1854
03:03:01.678 --> 03:03:05.056
And to the death.
And the victor shall be crucified.

1855
03:03:06.057 --> 03:03:09.019
We will test this myth of slave brotherhood.

1856
03:03:09.519 --> 03:03:10.979
Unchain them!

1857
03:03:16.193 --> 03:03:17.569
(HAMMERING)

1858
03:03:18.945 --> 03:03:20.447
Form a circle.

1859
03:03:37.339 --> 03:03:39.466
Don't give them the pleasure of a contest.

1860
03:03:39.549 --> 03:03:41.259
Lower your guard.
I'll kill you on the first rush.

1861
03:03:41.343 --> 03:03:42.427
I won't let them crucify you.

1862
03:03:42.511 --> 03:03:44.804
It's my last order. Obey it.

1863
03:03:44.888 --> 03:03:46.431
CRASSUS: Let them begin.

1864
03:04:23.260 --> 03:04:25.470
I won't let them crucify you.

1865
03:04:36.356 --> 03:04:39.025
Do you realize how long it takes
to die on a cross”?

1866
03:04:39.109 --> 03:04:40.402
I don't care!

1867
03:04:57.544 --> 03:04:59.421
Forgive me, Antoninus.

1868
03:04:59.504 --> 03:05:00.839
(ANTONINUS GRUNTS)

1869
03:05:09.889 --> 03:05:14.185
I love you, Spartacus,
as I loved my own father.

1870
03:05:14.853 --> 03:05:19.190
I love you like my son that I'll never see.

1871
03:05:23.862 --> 03:05:25.280
Go to sleep.

1872
03:05:59.981 --> 03:06:01.733
Here's your victory.

1873
03:06:04.069 --> 03:06:05.695
He'll come back.

1874
03:06:06.321 --> 03:06:09.032
He'll come back and he'll be millions!

1875
03:06:13.620 --> 03:06:16.081
I wonder what Spartacus would say

1876
03:06:16.956 --> 03:06:20.377
if he knew that the woman, Varinia,
and her child

1877
03:06:21.294 --> 03:06:23.588
are slaves in my household?

1878
03:06:36.726 --> 03:06:37.769
Yes.

1879
03:06:41.064 --> 03:06:42.399
Spartacus.

1880
03:06:47.112 --> 03:06:48.488
Crucify him!

1881
03:07:07.257 --> 03:07:09.759
I want no grave for him. No marker.

1882
03:07:09.968 --> 03:07:13.596
His body's to be burned
and his ashes scattered in secret.

1883
03:07:23.148 --> 03:07:25.150
Did you fear him, Crassus?

1884
03:07:25.692 --> 03:07:28.945
Not when I fought him.
I knew he could be beaten.

1885
03:07:30.029 --> 03:07:33.825
But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

1886
03:07:33.908 --> 03:07:37.620
-Me?
-Yes, my dear Caesar. You!

1887
03:07:39.789 --> 03:07:43.334
I don't see the letter here
to the leader of the Senate.

1888
03:07:43.626 --> 03:07:47.088
Oh, yes.
Julia, I don't like the sound of weeping.

1889
03:07:47.172 --> 03:07:49.674
This is a happy house. Please stop.

1890
03:07:51.176 --> 03:07:54.304
Oh, there you are. Go away, Julia!
Where have you been?

1891
03:07:54.345 --> 03:07:56.848
The city is full of Crassus' legions.
We've been hiding.

1892
03:07:56.890 --> 03:07:59.392
I don't know Rome as well as I know Capua.

1893
03:07:59.476 --> 03:08:01.561
They're arresting everyone.

1894
03:08:11.362 --> 03:08:15.575
So this is the woman it took Crassus
eight Roman legions to conquer.

1895
03:08:15.658 --> 03:08:18.953
I wish I had time
to make your acquaintance, my dear.

1896
03:08:19.037 --> 03:08:23.958
Unfortunately, we all have to make journeys
to different destinations.

1897
03:08:24.417 --> 03:08:26.211
Where are we going?

1898
03:08:27.003 --> 03:08:30.006
You're going to Aquitania. The governor's
one of my innumerable cousins.

1899
03:08:30.048 --> 03:08:33.468
Here's a senatorial pass.
It's valid in all the known world.

1900
03:08:33.551 --> 03:08:37.722
-Why do I have to go to Aquitania?
-GRACCHUS: 'Cause I asked you to.

1901
03:08:37.764 --> 03:08:40.266
It's very good of you, Gracchus, but I...

1902
03:08:40.350 --> 03:08:44.229
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.

1903
03:08:44.270 --> 03:08:45.730
Two million?

1904
03:08:46.606 --> 03:08:50.276
Here. Articles of freedom for the woman.

1905
03:08:50.610 --> 03:08:54.906
And here's a smaller document
that I've prepared for the child,

1906
03:08:54.948 --> 03:08:56.699
befitting its size.

1907
03:09:02.914 --> 03:09:05.750
-Where are you going?
-Mmm?

1908
03:09:06.626 --> 03:09:08.419
Oh, to Picenum.

1909
03:09:08.753 --> 03:09:11.214
Picenum? That's the dreariest town in Italy.

1910
03:09:11.256 --> 03:09:13.258
Will you please leave me?

1911
03:09:15.176 --> 03:09:19.264
Come with us.
See to it that I don't misuse the money.

1912
03:09:19.389 --> 03:09:21.724
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a senator.

1913
03:09:21.766 --> 03:09:24.936
Will you please go
before the soldiers come here?

1914
03:09:30.316 --> 03:09:31.818
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

1915
03:09:32.318 --> 03:09:35.405
This would really make Crassus jealous.

1916
03:09:37.448 --> 03:09:39.450
Go and make my joy complete.

1917
03:09:39.492 --> 03:09:42.579
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.

1918
03:09:51.462 --> 03:09:54.132
Well. Prettier.

1919
03:10:14.027 --> 03:10:15.153
Halt!

1920
03:10:20.700 --> 03:10:22.744
Identify yourselves, please.

1921
03:10:22.827 --> 03:10:25.163
Lentulus Batiatus.

1922
03:10:25.246 --> 03:10:27.665
Climb down, please,
and identify yourselves.

1923
03:10:27.707 --> 03:10:30.752
-I object to that tone.
-I've got my orders.

1924
03:10:30.835 --> 03:10:33.671
Come down and identify yourselves, please.

1925
03:10:39.802 --> 03:10:41.095
(CLEARING THROAT)

1926
03:10:41.179 --> 03:10:44.849
As I told you, I'm Lentulus Batiatus,
the lanista from Capua.

1927
03:10:44.891 --> 03:10:48.311
This... My sister-in-law.

1928
03:10:51.981 --> 03:10:53.816
Lady, please.

1929
03:10:54.901 --> 03:10:59.364
She's traveling with her child to Aquitania

1930
03:10:59.447 --> 03:11:01.783
on a senatorial pass.

1931
03:11:01.866 --> 03:11:05.286
-Take a look through his baggage.
-Not a word, please.

1932
03:11:11.876 --> 03:11:13.544
What did you say?

1933
03:11:23.846 --> 03:11:25.723
(SOFTLY) Oh, Spartacus.

1934
03:11:50.957 --> 03:11:52.500
(CRYING)

1935
03:11:56.212 --> 03:11:59.257
-Tell the lady no loitering's allowed.
-Instantly.

1936
03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:00.842
-Move on.
-Yes.

1937
03:12:05.346 --> 03:12:06.973
This is your son.

1938
03:12:09.392 --> 03:12:12.770
He's free, Spartacus! Free!

1939
03:12:16.065 --> 03:12:17.442
He's free.

1940
03:12:19.110 --> 03:12:20.820
He's free.

1941
03:12:23.698 --> 03:12:27.785
He'll remember you, Spartacus,
because I'll tell him.

1942
03:12:29.620 --> 03:12:33.124
I'll tell him who his father was
and what he dreamed of.

1943
03:12:36.294 --> 03:12:39.589
BATIATUS: Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.

1944
03:12:41.007 --> 03:12:42.800
Oh, my love, my life.

1945
03:12:45.636 --> 03:12:47.847
Please die, die.

1946
03:12:48.473 --> 03:12:51.100
Please, please die, my love.

1947
03:12:51.851 --> 03:12:53.936
Oh, God, why can't you die!

1948
03:12:53.978 --> 03:12:55.980
Come on. Come on.

1949
03:13:12.080 --> 03:13:14.582
Goodbye, my love, my life.

1950
03:13:15.083 --> 03:13:16.918
Goodbye, goodbye.
