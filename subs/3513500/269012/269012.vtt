1
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:49,377
You're special.

2
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,337
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.</i>

3
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:57,742
You've been chosen.

4
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,058
The Island awaits you.

5
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,825
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

6
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:30,785
<i>Good morning, Tower One.</i>

7
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:34,145
<i>Exterior contamination index</i>
<i>is 85 percent.</i>

8
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:35,661
<i>Sunny and mild.</i>

9
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,300
Hey, I'm missing a left shoe.

10
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:55,418
<i>And when you get a chance,</i>
<i>I'd like another color.</i>

11
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,423
- Morning.
- Morning.

12
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:18,145
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- I'm missing a shoe.

13
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:31,345
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:33,745
Thank you.

15
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:36,340
We're full.

16
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:43,262
<i>Good morning. July 19, 2019.</i>

17
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,066
Another day in paradise.

18
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:01,898
<i>Starkweather Two Delta,</i>
<i>your time has come.</i>

19
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:05,147
<i>You're moving out to The Island.</i>

20
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,821
<i>Starkweather Two Delta here.</i>

21
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:10,344
<i>And as you know, the biggest dream</i>
<i>of my life just came true.</i>

22
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:15,059
<i>I mean, I've only been with you guys for,</i>
<i>like, six months, but I won the lottery.</i>

23
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:17,139
<i>- That's right, me.</i>
- Six months.

24
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:21,546
<i>To go out and breathe fresh air.</i>
<i>Swim in the ocean.</i>

25
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:25,542
<i>I can 't believe I won.</i>
<i>You call me Mr. Popular, I know.</i>

26
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,381
<i>It's me. It's me.</i>

27
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:31,506
<i>You guys know I'm not like this,</i>
<i>but this is just amazing.</i>

28
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:36,620
<i>I'm going to The Island!</i>
<i>We're gonna have so much fun!</i>

29
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,939
<i>But I need to see you guys out there.</i>
<i>You can do it. I won!</i>

30
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,427
<i>That was this week's winner...</i>

31
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,863
We got a disturbance on elevator 12,
plaza level.

32
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:47,504
<i>- Just moments before his final</i>
<i>departure to The Island...</i>

33
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:50,502
<i>... nature's last remaining</i>
<i>pathogen-free zone.</i>

34
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,938
Lucky guy, huh? Don't you think?

35
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,578
<i>The next lottery is tonight.</i>

36
00:05:57,188 --> 00:06:00,624
"The next lottery is tonight."

37
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:05,428
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

38
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:08,938
- What about you?
- Three.

39
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:11,139
Three. I've been here seven.

40
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:15,062
If I do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

41
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,978
I'm such a loser.

42
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,819
Sir.

43
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:51,946
Yeah, you.

44
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,382
Swipe.

45
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,219
Gandu Three Echo. You've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

46
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,188
Yes, I had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

47
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:06,499
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

48
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:08,221
I'm feeling much better.

49
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,146
- Then have a pleasant day.
- You too.

50
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,101
You both have a pleasant day too.

51
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,816
Stretch.

52
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:38,783
One more breath in.

53
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:00,501
- Listen.
- I tried to do better.

54
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:06,264
<i>Remember, be polite,</i>
<i>pleasant and peaceful.</i>

55
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:09,665
<i>A healthy person is a happy person.</i>

56
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:20,183
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

57
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:22,307
No bacon today?

58
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,424
You got a nutrition flag.
Means no bacon.

59
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,978
Then I'll have two eggs, over easy,
not too runny, and a side of sausages.

60
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,537
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

61
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,665
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

62
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:37,941
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- Move it.

63
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:43,024
Surprise me.

64
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:49,499
Surprise.

65
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:52,503
Yummy. Next.

66
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,457
Watch and learn.

67
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,382
Next.

68
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,379
Jordan Two Delta.

69
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,300
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

70
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:16,824
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

71
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,548
- Eggs, please.
- Okay.

72
00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:23,548
So where were you the other day?
We missed you.

73
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:27,106
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

74
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:29,347
Get you anything else?

75
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,547
Maybe a little bacon.

76
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,180
- No, it says I shouldn't.
- Go ahead.

77
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,744
Four... Five pieces, please.

78
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,577
Thank you.

79
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,222
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

80
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:51,741
Back on your diet, huh?

81
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,222
You kidding? I love this.

82
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,817
Better eat up.
You'll need your strength tonight.

83
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:59,219
- Is that a challenge?
- I promise I'll go easy on you.

84
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,825
Please separate. Find your seats now.

85
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:10,023
"'Who wants Sally? ' said Dick.

86
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,304
'I do,' said Jane.

87
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:15,107
'I cannot find Sally.

88
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:19,500
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.'

89
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,020
'Ls Sally here? '"

90
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:36,378
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

91
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,866
What did you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

92
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,780
Sir?

93
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,700
You wanted to see me?

94
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,541
Yes. Please.

95
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:03,301
Please sit down.

96
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,023
So how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

97
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,258
Not so good, I guess.

98
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,620
Why do you say that?

99
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,302
Well, if I'm here,
it means I'm not so good.

100
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:17,387
That's a rather negative association.

101
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:21,587
My only job is to see that you're happy,
that things are okay with you.

102
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,147
Right.

103
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:29,147
Your file shows that you've been
interacting regularly...

104
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:30,582
...with Jordan Two Delta.

105
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:32,580
There's no law against friendship.

106
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:38,698
No, we encourage it, but obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

107
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,626
I know the rules of proximity.

108
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,582
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

109
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,421
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

110
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:51,898
But screening has picked up
some trace levels...

111
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:55,896
...changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

112
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,658
Are you saying there's something
wrong with me?

113
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:01,418
Why don't you tell me
about your dream.

114
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,181
Well, it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat, headed to The Island.

115
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:09,306
A boat? What kind of boat?

116
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,062
A nice boat.

117
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:13,627
Draw it for me, would you?

118
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:22,418
So you're heading toward The Island.

119
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:24,260
What happens then?

120
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:25,747
I drown.

121
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:27,501
Really?

122
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:29,421
Why do you think that is?

123
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:31,340
I don't know. You tell me.

124
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:33,942
- Are you afraid of winning?
- Why would I be afraid?

125
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,666
You tell me.

126
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,823
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

127
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,540
Well, it's...

128
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:48,506
It's just...

129
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,818
All right. Tuesday night is tofu night...

130
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:55,537
...and I'm asking myself, "Who decided
that everyone here likes tofu?"

131
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,346
And what is tofu, anyway?

132
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,307
And why can't I have bacon?

133
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:02,665
I line up every morning and I'm not
allowed bacon for my breakfast.

134
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:05,777
And tell me...
Let's talk about all the white.

135
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:07,700
Why is everyone
always wearing white?

136
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:09,307
It's impossible to keep clean.

137
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:12,301
I always get the gray stripe.
I never get any color.

138
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,466
And I hand it in to be cleaned,
and someone cleans it...

139
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,903
...and folds it neatly back in my drawer,
but who?

140
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,258
Who is that person? I don't know.

141
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:25,220
I just... I wanna know answers,
and I wish that there was more.

142
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,987
More?

143
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:32,221
Yeah. More than just waiting
to go to The Island.

144
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,701
Lincoln...

145
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,386
...it's your nature to question things.

146
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:43,142
But don't you realize
how lucky you are?

147
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,020
That you survived the contamination.

148
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:48,942
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

149
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,020
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

150
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:59,783
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to The Island too?

151
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:01,821
No.

152
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:07,468
My responsibility is to make sure
this facility continues to operate.

153
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:12,748
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

154
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,224
We can't win the lottery.

155
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:20,544
Let me see that.

156
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,146
You draw well.

157
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:25,536
<i>"Renovatio."</i>

158
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:29,058
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. It's always in my dream.

159
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,659
I'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

160
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,621
- What sort of tests?
- Nice tests.

161
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:40,497
Come with me.

162
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,146
Take a seat.

163
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:57,259
Okay, let's get you comfortable.
Swing back.

164
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,299
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

165
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:07,299
Totally harmless.

166
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,176
Don't worry, it's painless.

167
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:31,867
- It hurts.
- Not really.

168
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:33,581
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

169
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,938
Yeah, it really, really does!

170
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,866
The microsensors will move along
your optic nerve.

171
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:47,340
They'll be uploading readings to us
over the next 24 hours...

172
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:49,942
...after which you'll pass them
through your urine.

173
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:52,224
Now, that might hurt.

174
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,506
Six Echo, you're late.

175
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:21,503
- Jones, you ever get bored doing this?
- Doing what?

176
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,545
- This.
- I never really thought about it.

177
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,346
- I think about it a lot.
- About what?

178
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:28,142
This boring job.
What are we doing here, anyway?

179
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,980
We're feeding the nutrient lines.

180
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,708
We eat food,
food's gotta have vitamins, right?

181
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,985
- It's good for us.
- You don't ever wonder about anything?

182
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,418
Where do these tubes go?

183
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,982
They start there.
And they go... right there.

184
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:47,816
Hey, did you get a look
at the new guy?

185
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:50,059
Seven Foxtrot.

186
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:51,741
They found another survivor.

187
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:55,265
- They keep finding them.
- He'll probably win the lottery tomorrow.

188
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,384
Straight down, in the hole.

189
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:59,584
There you go, you try it.
Straight down.

190
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:01,864
- In...
- In the hole.

191
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:05,703
In the hole. No, no. No. No.
Put it down.

192
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:08,701
Did we look that stupid when
we went through decontamination?

193
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:13,186
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-the-Questions,
let me ask you this.

194
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,181
- Lottery's supposed to be random, right?
- Right.

195
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:20,341
What if it's not? What if it's rigged?

196
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,021
Rigged?

197
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,745
I've been working on this. Here.

198
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:26,707
Take a look at that.

199
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,427
It charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on The Island.

200
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:33,625
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

201
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:36,382
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

202
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,621
I assigned it a point value
based on its alphabet position.

203
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,858
Like the last, Starkweather,
S equals 15.

204
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:45,185
Q equals 15, S equals 19.
Do you see what I'm saying?

205
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,259
- No.
- Maybe if you would listen to me.

206
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,066
I'm trying to tell you.

207
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:52,061
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

208
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:55,698
You multiply it by the amount...
You divide it by the amount of peop...

209
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,626
Divide by the amount
of people here.

210
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:01,218
Which is 25... A thousand plus 5... 2500.
You know what that spells?

211
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,739
J-O-N-E-S.

212
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:07,262
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

213
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:10,102
- No.
- Gentlemen...

214
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:13,503
...I'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

215
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:15,659
There you go. Straight...

216
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,865
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go.

217
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,701
- He had something on his...
- Go.

218
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:30,546
Lima! Are you okay?

219
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,064
Code 15! We need med-techs
down here, stat! Lima One Alpha.

220
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:35,820
Just give her some air, okay?

221
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:38,417
You're gonna be okay.
Just relax and breathe.

222
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:42,177
Can I get a wheelchair down here,
please? It's for Lima One Alpha.

223
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:44,466
I think it's time.

224
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,745
Lima. You're going to The Island.

225
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:52,667
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

226
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:54,540
I hope I see you soon.

227
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:58,741
Everyone, please follow her out.

228
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:01,587
Quickly and carefully.
Watch the glass.

229
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:04,183
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

230
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,423
That's fair. That's real fair.

231
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:13,780
Ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen, thank you.

232
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,664
Everyone, back to work.

233
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:22,104
That is so not fair!

234
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:26,302
Oh, man, I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

235
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,186
Tech Services.

236
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:30,141
Computer's down again.

237
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:33,059
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

238
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:35,378
I have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-key.

239
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:38,346
- Contamination kit. Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

240
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:08,708
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

241
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:13,543
Hey, we've got live wires
all over the place here.

242
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:16,820
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

243
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,060
- What?
- I've been looking all over...

244
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,742
- Can't hear you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

245
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:26,022
If you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

246
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:28,822
- How you doing, Mac?
- What are you doing here?

247
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,462
My chip fried again.

248
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:34,504
Yeah, your chip fried. How much longer
you think that one's gonna work?

249
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,266
What are you clowns looking at?

250
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:40,540
Hey, got any of that stuff
on you today?

251
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,856
Oh, look, it's break time. Come on.

252
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,943
You're a bad influence on me.

253
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,863
Must be why I like you so much.

254
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,064
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

255
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:02,583
Well, it's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, I guess.

256
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:08,263
I like coming out here, talking.

257
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,184
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

258
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:12,901
Yeah.

259
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:16,064
Step into my office.

260
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,787
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

261
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,706
Where are their clothes?

262
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:28,500
Hey, what's with Dr. Merrick?

263
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:32,707
You mean, why does he act like he's got
a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

264
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:36,497
- Yeah.
- It's called a "God complex."

265
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:38,943
Doctors are like that.
Think they know everything.

266
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:40,820
What's God?

267
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:45,817
You know when you want something
really bad and you wish for it?

268
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,706
God's the guy that ignores you.

269
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,907
Oh, right.

270
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,577
<i>Tech service requested</i>
<i>in Product Extraction.</i>

271
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:54,704
Yeah, I'll be right there.

272
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:00,423
Oh, hey, let me get that.

273
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:03,577
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

274
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,418
It's an old stash.
You know, from before.

275
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:08,465
You mean from before
the contamination?

276
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:11,665
Yeah. Come on,
you're killing me with questions here.

277
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,620
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

278
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:16,780
Because you're, you know,
like, special.

279
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:18,580
Why? Why am I special?

280
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,946
There's another question.

281
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:25,463
You remember what we talked about?
You don't tell anybody about our talks?

282
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,220
- No.
- That'll get me in big trouble.

283
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,741
No, I don't.

284
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,945
Good.

285
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:13,341
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

286
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:16,066
Okay, I'll catch you later.

287
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,064
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

288
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:23,581
Yep.

289
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:25,659
What a surprise.

290
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:29,826
Go hot.

291
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:36,380
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

292
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:41,186
You'd think with the money they make,
they could afford decent equipment.

293
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:43,140
Yeah. Ready?

294
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:47,985
Cut the O2.

295
00:23:49,348 --> 00:23:52,863
Seriously, unless you wanna see me
blow chunks, can you wait till I'm gone?

296
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:55,019
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

297
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:18,907
Breathe!

298
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,142
Come on, yeah. That's it.

299
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:26,702
Come on, breathe.

300
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:29,666
Come on.

301
00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:32,265
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

302
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:36,180
There we go. Now we're working.
He's healthy.

303
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,621
Welcome to the world.

304
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:47,745
- So how's Three Hilo?
- Good.

305
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:52,223
He's feisty. Light.

306
00:24:53,588 --> 00:24:56,341
Vitals seem fine.

307
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,462
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

308
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:04,418
Looks like we have a fine product.

309
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:06,744
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

310
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:22,580
Little bug.

311
00:27:08,268 --> 00:27:10,736
Next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

312
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,026
It was very sad.

313
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:21,942
- Hey.
- Hello.

314
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,427
Hi.

315
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:27,588
You just let a little girl
beat you, huh?

316
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:30,942
Stim units restricted.

317
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,104
Yeah, yeah. I'll have the veggie stuff.

318
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,862
Papassian petal juice, please.

319
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:37,427
It's good for the skin.

320
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:51,345
Jordan, are you sick?

321
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:56,227
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office,
I thought I saw your name on a file.

322
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,539
No, I'm fine.

323
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:00,347
Okay.

324
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:02,786
How are you?

325
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,547
I'm fine.

326
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:09,984
Lincoln, I can tell when you lie because
your mouth smiles but your eyes don't.

327
00:28:12,428 --> 00:28:13,861
- I found something.
- What?

328
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:15,905
- A bug.
- A bug?

329
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:18,024
- A flying bug.
- Can I see it?

330
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:20,383
I think it came in the ventilation shaft.

331
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:22,664
But they went extinct
with the contamination.

332
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,302
I know. And how did it get
by the pathogen sensors?

333
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:27,743
- It must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

334
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:30,781
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

335
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:33,781
They keep finding people and bringing
them here. From where?

336
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:36,828
It's good that they find survivors.

337
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:40,583
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

338
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:43,137
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

339
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,578
Good things do happen.

340
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:48,579
I wanna see that bug.

341
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,987
Hey, Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

342
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,264
- What?
- "Dude."

343
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:58,943
- "Dude"? What does it mean?
- I don't know. He just called me "dude."

344
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:00,860
- Hey, dude.
- He said, "Hey, dude"?

345
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:02,746
Hey, dude. D-O-O-D. "Dood."

346
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,421
- Hey, dood.
- Dood.

347
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:05,777
Lottery's starting.

348
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:07,939
- Like you stand a chance.
- Dude.

349
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:11,827
Light up all etherscreens.

350
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:14,866
And start the lottery.

351
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:27,577
<i>Good evening. Live from Ether-Con,</i>
<i>welcome to the lottery spin.</i>

352
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:30,420
<i>It's been a busy week.</i>

353
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:33,426
<i>We've had a record two winners</i>
<i>so far.</i>

354
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:38,144
<i>Tonight's winner will be selected</i>
<i>at random for relocation to The Island...</i>

355
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:40,902
<i>... transported to the world's</i>
<i>last paradise.</i>

356
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:44,259
- And start the spin.
<i>- And now let the spin begin.</i>

357
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:51,264
<i>Jordan Two Delta.</i>

358
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:54,101
<i>Step up, your time has come.</i>

359
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:57,027
<i>You're moving out to The Island.</i>

360
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:06,062
<i>For everyone else, never lose hope.</i>

361
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:10,499
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:13,387
I can't believe it.

363
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:23,098
I have to go in the morning.

364
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:24,826
You were right.

365
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:28,898
Good things do happen.

366
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,858
I wish I'd known you better.

367
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:39,786
You two. Watch your proximity.

368
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,305
I'll see you on The Island.

369
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:10,865
You want to go to The Island.

370
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:16,937
Breathe!

371
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:19,861
You've been chosen.

372
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:24,946
<i>The Island awaits you.</i>

373
00:33:50,188 --> 00:33:52,622
She's so beautiful.

374
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,420
I've never seen a baby.

375
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,298
- Can I hold her?
- Not just yet.

376
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,780
We're going to The Island?

377
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:23,227
Oh, my God.

378
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:26,263
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

379
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,259
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

380
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:31,147
- My baby. Oh, my gosh.
- Whenever you're ready...

381
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:34,778
...we have copies of your policy
termination for your records.

382
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:37,497
Look at her. She's beautiful.

383
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:43,345
Starkweather? That cute football player
on the Reebok commercials?

384
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,102
I love him! Is he in there?
I thought that was him, girl!

385
00:35:46,308 --> 00:35:47,741
I just love him.

386
00:35:48,788 --> 00:35:50,824
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

387
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:52,984
Any chance I can make this pickup?

388
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:55,025
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

389
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:59,221
Lady, I've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

390
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:02,420
We don't fly in bad weather.

391
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,457
They look real busy,
so I'd have a seat.

392
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:11,864
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

393
00:36:12,228 --> 00:36:16,983
Heart rate, 102. BP, 126/82.

394
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:19,343
- All right, laser cutter ready?
- It's ready.

395
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:22,022
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

396
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:23,906
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

397
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:26,059
Prepare that bone saw.

398
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:29,337
I think we're about ready to open.

399
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:49,020
Let's clean that drip.

400
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:54,667
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

401
00:36:56,828 --> 00:37:00,741
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

402
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:06,787
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP, 138/92.

403
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,788
- Heart rate's still rising.
- Boost the anesthetic level.

404
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:14,381
He's fighting the ventilator.

405
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:17,620
I don't wanna have to euthanize
this guy to get his liver.

406
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,181
Oh, my God!

407
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:38,897
Stop that man! Get him!

408
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,181
Stop!

409
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:05,060
Relax. Relax, big guy.

410
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:07,145
Easy, easy! Don't damage him!

411
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:14,538
No! I don't wanna die! No!

412
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:18,297
I want to go to The Island!
You promised!

413
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:21,665
I wanna live! I don't wanna die!

414
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,982
No!

415
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,427
Hey. You okay, buddy?

416
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:31,217
It's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

417
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:34,425
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

418
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:46,623
Check this part out.

419
00:38:46,828 --> 00:38:48,659
Wait. Okay, watch. Wait, wait, wait.

420
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,859
Boom! Did you see that?

421
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:55,061
Man. That is so cruel, man.

422
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:58,187
Oh, man. Down for the count.

423
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,619
Gentlemen.

424
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:03,058
I understand there's been an incident.

425
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:05,543
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

426
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,903
- And you find that funny?
- No, sir.

427
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:10,942
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

428
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,139
Play it back, please.

429
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:19,707
Stop.

430
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,700
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

431
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:23,904
He was scared. I helped him up.

432
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,107
Play it back at half-speed.

433
00:39:32,908 --> 00:39:34,739
Freeze.

434
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:36,702
Magnify his wrist.

435
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,186
We have a product on the loose.

436
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,698
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

437
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:49,297
- Let's go.
- Okay, down to Level Two.

438
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:31,217
- How sweet. You came to...
- You gotta come with me.

439
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:33,420
Move! Move!

440
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:44,467
We got a match! Lincoln Six Echo.

441
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:48,177
I want a full contamination lockdown.
Find Six Echo.

442
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:51,902
Everybody, masks down.

443
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:54,542
- What the hell?
- I need to see all your faces.

444
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,216
I don't care what he says.
That's live human tissue.

445
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,061
- Seal that liver now.
- Check the back corners.

446
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:08,506
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

447
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:10,302
Find out.

448
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:14,779
What are you doing?
Men can't be in this...

449
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,178
- You gotta trust me. I saw them.
- Who?

450
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,379
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.
- What?

451
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:21,061
They killed her and cut him open.

452
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:23,020
Stop it! I wanna go back to my room.

453
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:25,867
- You can't. They'll kill you.
- I'm going to The Island.

454
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,104
- Jordan, there is no Island! Come on!
- No.

455
00:41:29,828 --> 00:41:32,296
I got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

456
00:41:32,468 --> 00:41:34,777
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

457
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:37,183
Get out of the way! Watch out.

458
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:38,980
Move! Move!

459
00:41:39,188 --> 00:41:41,065
Out of the way. Get out. Now.

460
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:42,897
Just trust me.

461
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:49,378
<i>This is a community bulletin.</i>

462
00:41:49,788 --> 00:41:51,346
<i>Attention, residents.</i>

463
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:55,103
<i>A contamination alert</i>
<i>has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.</i>

464
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:59,421
<i>Anyone coming in contact with him</i>
<i>will be quarantined.</i>

465
00:42:01,668 --> 00:42:03,863
Faster! Move!

466
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:09,307
Freeze! Stop right there!

467
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:13,381
Get out of the way!

468
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,666
- Go, go!
- Get out of the way!

469
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:42,777
I've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

470
00:42:57,228 --> 00:42:59,025
There they are!

471
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:02,023
I've got them
in the Sector Six basement!

472
00:43:02,188 --> 00:43:03,462
Get them!

473
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:16,220
- No!
- Stop!

474
00:43:26,628 --> 00:43:28,186
Lincoln!

475
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:30,738
No! Stop it!

476
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:35,106
No!

477
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,866
<i>You've been chosen.</i>

478
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,866
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.</i>
<i>Chosen to survive.</i>

479
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,145
<i>You are part of a new beginning.</i>
<i>You're special.</i>

480
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:23,096
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.</i>

481
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:30,177
<i>You want to go to The Island.</i>

482
00:44:30,388 --> 00:44:32,458
<i>You're a part of a new beginning.</i>

483
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,903
<i>You're special. You've been chosen.</i>

484
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:37,622
<i>Very special. Chosen to survive.</i>

485
00:44:37,828 --> 00:44:42,060
<i>To carry on.</i>
<i>You want to go to The Island.</i>

486
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:47,819
Go, go!

487
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,218
<i>Very special.</i>

488
00:44:56,268 --> 00:44:57,986
- He's gotta be in here.
- I'm looking!

489
00:44:58,188 --> 00:44:59,985
Check over here!

490
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:02,258
Watch your left! Watch your left!

491
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,547
Run.

492
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:09,427
Run.

493
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:11,425
He's over here.

494
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:17,180
<i>Very special.</i>
<i>You want to go to The Island.</i>

495
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,623
There they are.

496
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,858
- Lincoln!
- Come on!

497
00:45:35,028 --> 00:45:37,258
Get them! Let's go!

498
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,301
- Move!
- Come on!

499
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:43,140
Come on, come on. Damn!

500
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,661
Go, go, go. Come on.

501
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:52,423
You still think there's an Island?

502
00:46:02,748 --> 00:46:04,147
Come on.

503
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:30,703
Come on. Come on.

504
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:49,786
There's a door over here!

505
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:06,944
<i>Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine</i>
<i>after contamination exposure.</i>

506
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:12,023
<i>Jordan Two Delta was safely transported</i>
<i>to her new home on The Island.</i>

507
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:15,340
Jones Three Echo, I need you
to concentrate in this lab.

508
00:48:15,548 --> 00:48:18,540
Sir, I want to focus.
I love my job. It's very interesting.

509
00:48:18,748 --> 00:48:21,626
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated...

510
00:48:21,828 --> 00:48:25,025
...and it really worries me because
he's a very good friend of mine.

511
00:48:25,188 --> 00:48:27,019
And he's my only best friend.

512
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:29,344
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

513
00:48:29,508 --> 00:48:33,421
Sir, I have one question.
Where do all the tubes go?

514
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:37,660
<i>The human organism.</i>

515
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:40,581
<i>Unique in all the universe</i>
<i>in its complexity.</i>

516
00:48:40,748 --> 00:48:43,387
<i>The product of 3 billion years</i>
<i>of evolution.</i>

517
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:46,779
<i>Prefect in every way except one.</i>

518
00:48:46,988 --> 00:48:50,344
<i>Like all machines, it wears out.</i>

519
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:53,541
<i>For centuries, the idea of replenishing</i>
<i>the human body...</i>

520
00:48:53,748 --> 00:48:55,704
<i>... has been at the forefront</i>
<i>of science.</i>

521
00:48:55,868 --> 00:48:58,428
I think we need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

522
00:48:58,588 --> 00:49:00,977
- How?
- By selling. Sell, sell, sell.

523
00:49:01,148 --> 00:49:02,627
You start, I finish.

524
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:14,385
Ladies and gentlemen...

525
00:49:14,548 --> 00:49:18,097
...welcome to the next generation
of science:

526
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:20,105
The agnate.

527
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:24,181
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood...

528
00:49:24,348 --> 00:49:25,861
...to match the client's age.

529
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:29,904
You're looking at stage one
of its development.

530
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:32,502
Within 12 months,
it will be harvest-ready...

531
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:36,741
...providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin...

532
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:40,139
...all genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

533
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:44,824
And in compliance
with the eugenics laws of 2015...

534
00:49:44,988 --> 00:49:49,937
...all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

535
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:52,144
They never achieve consciousness.

536
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:54,737
They never think...

537
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:59,379
...or suffer or feel pain,
joy, love, hate.

538
00:49:59,548 --> 00:50:02,187
It's a product, ladies and gentlemen...

539
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:04,066
...in every way that matters.

540
00:50:05,028 --> 00:50:07,542
<i>Not human.</i>

541
00:50:11,668 --> 00:50:14,785
This is our public-relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

542
00:50:14,948 --> 00:50:17,018
He'll be happy to answer
your questions.

543
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:19,099
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

544
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:23,062
I wanna talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

545
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:27,503
And I wanna tell you how you're gonna
live 60 to <i>70</i> years longer.

546
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:34,944
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

547
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:38,259
You come highly recommended by
the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

548
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,062
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

549
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:43,822
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

550
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:46,582
I was formerly with the GIGN,
French special forces.

551
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:48,858
I understand you had
a corporate theft.

552
00:50:49,068 --> 00:50:51,343
Yes, that's what I told
the Defense Department.

553
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:55,183
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

554
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:58,226
We've had a security breach.

555
00:50:58,428 --> 00:51:01,818
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

556
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:04,542
Because their investment here
is sizable.

557
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,666
One hundred and twenty billion dollars,
to be exact.

558
00:51:07,828 --> 00:51:10,501
And I can't afford for them
to reconsider.

559
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,699
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

560
00:51:12,868 --> 00:51:15,621
I am in the business of keeping
my clients' confidence.

561
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:17,827
Good.

562
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:24,096
Two of our products have escaped.

563
00:51:24,308 --> 00:51:26,697
Impressive, considering
they're vegetative.

564
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:29,701
Well, after several years
of trial and error...

565
00:51:29,868 --> 00:51:31,938
...we discovered that
without consciousness...

566
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:34,019
...without human experience, emotion...

567
00:51:34,748 --> 00:51:36,500
...without life...

568
00:51:37,308 --> 00:51:39,264
...the organs failed.

569
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:42,820
How long have they been missing?

570
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,624
Four hours and 36 minutes.

571
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:48,382
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

572
00:51:48,548 --> 00:51:52,097
Wade, 1.2 miles an hour,
five-mile perimeter.

573
00:51:52,308 --> 00:51:54,264
Stand by for suspect description.

574
00:51:54,468 --> 00:51:56,618
- We're on it.
- Follow me.

575
00:52:13,108 --> 00:52:16,225
- Come on. We gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

576
00:52:16,388 --> 00:52:17,821
- You gotta try. Come on.
- Where?

577
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:20,098
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

578
00:52:20,268 --> 00:52:22,702
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

579
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,418
What if we are contaminated?

580
00:52:31,188 --> 00:52:32,940
Then we'd be dead.

581
00:52:33,908 --> 00:52:37,264
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

582
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:48,502
What is it?

583
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,580
I don't know. But it's alive.

584
00:52:56,268 --> 00:52:58,941
Come on. It's mean, whatever it is.

585
00:52:59,108 --> 00:53:00,382
Let's rest in here.

586
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:04,177
Jordan Two Delta sponsor, Sarah Jordan,
is in a coma after a car accident.

587
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,543
She's in need of multiple
organ transplants.

588
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:07,777
How long does she have?

589
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,224
Forty-eight hours.
Three days, maximum.

590
00:53:10,548 --> 00:53:11,947
Tell me about Six Echo.

591
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:15,345
Well, he was really the first one
to question his environment...

592
00:53:15,508 --> 00:53:16,827
...his whole existence here.

593
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:21,025
The last few months, he began
demonstrating unstable behavior...

594
00:53:21,188 --> 00:53:23,702
...and I can't account for it.

595
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:26,103
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

596
00:53:26,268 --> 00:53:27,986
What do they know
about the outside world?

597
00:53:28,828 --> 00:53:30,466
Very little.

598
00:53:30,628 --> 00:53:33,540
We control them with the memory
of a shared event.

599
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:35,141
A global contamination.

600
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:37,737
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

601
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,782
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope.

602
00:53:42,308 --> 00:53:44,344
Gives them purpose.

603
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:47,018
Everything we expose them to...

604
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:50,498
...their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play...

605
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:54,018
...are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

606
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:56,544
<i>To avoid obvious complications...</i>

607
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:59,222
<i>... they aren 't imprinted</i>
<i>with an awareness of sex.</i>

608
00:53:59,388 --> 00:54:02,380
<i>We find it simpler to eliminate</i>
<i>the drive altogether.</i>

609
00:54:03,108 --> 00:54:05,497
In a very real sense...

610
00:54:06,268 --> 00:54:08,020
...they're like children.

611
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:10,622
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

612
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:30,220
- What was that?
- I don't know.

613
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,779
But I want one.

614
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:49,027
Look!

615
00:54:49,948 --> 00:54:53,065
Route 39. Route 39.

616
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:54,786
Come on.

617
00:54:55,468 --> 00:54:57,663
I got it from a friend.

618
00:55:21,228 --> 00:55:23,105
I think that's it.

619
00:55:53,468 --> 00:55:54,742
What's up?

620
00:55:54,908 --> 00:55:56,899
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

621
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,579
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

622
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:05,098
- I am.
- And you would be who?

623
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:08,146
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

624
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:11,106
Right.

625
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:13,938
Y'all some of those
desert UFO freaks?

626
00:56:14,148 --> 00:56:17,265
- U...? What? No. I don't think so, no.
- No.

627
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:19,384
- McCord?
- Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.

628
00:56:19,548 --> 00:56:21,664
- He's in the can.
- He's in a can?

629
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:23,506
Taking a dump.

630
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,744
A dump? Taking it where?

631
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:29,658
Tell you what,
you're fixing to get on my nerves.

632
00:56:29,828 --> 00:56:32,979
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

633
00:56:33,148 --> 00:56:35,742
I have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

634
00:56:35,948 --> 00:56:38,746
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

635
00:56:39,108 --> 00:56:40,700
Straight up?

636
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,466
That is bitchen.

637
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,380
So this is Sector Five?

638
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:59,624
Hey! You son of a bitch!

639
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:03,146
You knew!

640
00:57:03,308 --> 00:57:06,584
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why? Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

641
00:57:06,748 --> 00:57:09,262
- They'll be looking for you.
- Tell me what's going on!

642
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:13,302
What's going on is if anybody sees us
together, both of us are gonna be dead.

643
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:16,097
So will you just take your hands off me?
Let me...

644
00:57:16,908 --> 00:57:20,298
Let me pull my pants up.
I'll take you back to my place...

645
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:22,067
...so we can be alone, okay?

646
00:57:25,228 --> 00:57:28,265
- Ed.
- Mac.

647
00:57:29,348 --> 00:57:31,464
Give you boys a minute?

648
00:57:33,548 --> 00:57:35,300
What? This isn't what it looks like.

649
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,505
Sure. Sure.

650
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:43,940
Get out of here, you stupid...
Will you stop?

651
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:48,185
You can't just bust in on a guy like that.
That's really rude.

652
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:51,818
She doesn't understand licking.

653
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:54,627
What are you, a knucklehead?
You brought another with you?

654
00:57:54,828 --> 00:57:56,227
Excuse me. Listen, will you...?

655
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:58,822
Hey, back off, Joe, okay?
Don't push me!

656
00:57:58,988 --> 00:58:01,627
No, that's no good.
Put it on my tab. We gotta go.

657
00:58:01,788 --> 00:58:03,699
Friends of mine.
They're from out of town.

658
00:58:03,868 --> 00:58:05,381
- Let's go.
- Give me your number.

659
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,824
- Two Delta.
- Hey. Don't test me.

660
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:10,501
Don't.

661
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:24,297
Well, this is nice.

662
00:58:27,548 --> 00:58:30,142
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

663
00:58:30,308 --> 00:58:32,378
Do y'all work with him?

664
00:58:33,668 --> 00:58:36,626
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

665
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:38,779
Some fancy tracksuits.

666
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:43,307
Y'all exercise out in this heat, you'll get
yourself some nasty heat stroke.

667
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:44,742
Oh, Mac.

668
00:58:44,948 --> 00:58:48,497
Look, they got matching bracelets.
We should do that, honey.

669
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:50,027
Suzie.

670
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:53,736
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

671
00:58:55,468 --> 00:58:56,742
Yeah.

672
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,422
Would you run down to Red's
and pick up a sixer of Bud?

673
00:58:59,628 --> 00:59:02,700
- We gotta talk shop.
- Okay, baby.

674
00:59:02,908 --> 00:59:04,182
Just making friends.

675
00:59:04,388 --> 00:59:06,219
- I know. Good. Just...
- Bye.

676
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:13,742
Why do they lie, Mac?

677
00:59:14,188 --> 00:59:16,702
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

678
00:59:19,828 --> 00:59:21,784
To keep you from knowing
what you are.

679
00:59:22,788 --> 00:59:26,098
- What we are?
- What are we?

680
00:59:26,548 --> 00:59:29,984
Man, why do I gotta be the guy that
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

681
00:59:34,242 --> 00:59:36,517
Okay, look. You're...

682
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:40,758
Well, you're not like me.

683
00:59:43,002 --> 00:59:45,516
I mean, you're not human.

684
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:51,155
I mean, you're human, but you're just...
You're not real.

685
00:59:51,602 --> 00:59:53,194
You're not like a real person.

686
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:55,114
Like me.

687
00:59:57,922 --> 00:59:59,878
You're clones.

688
01:00:02,162 --> 01:00:05,632
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

689
01:00:06,322 --> 01:00:07,596
- What?
- Clones?

690
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:09,878
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

691
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:12,721
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a face-lift...

692
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:17,074
...or one of them gets sick and they
need a new part, they take it from you.

693
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:21,874
But I have a mother. I remember her.

694
01:00:22,082 --> 01:00:24,038
- Yeah, I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

695
01:00:24,242 --> 01:00:27,678
- I have a little dog and I had a bike.
- And a bike. Right.

696
01:00:27,842 --> 01:00:30,959
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars...

697
01:00:31,162 --> 01:00:33,153
...and you rode it
to your grandma's house.

698
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:36,354
You ring a bell. She came out,
served you cookies on a hot plate.

699
01:00:36,722 --> 01:00:40,510
- Yeah.
- No. Memory imprints.

700
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:45,157
I seen them. My buddy is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

701
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:48,439
There's only, like, 12 stories.
They change around little details.

702
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:50,633
But they're all pretty much the same.

703
01:00:50,842 --> 01:00:56,075
The life you think you had
before the "contamination"?

704
01:00:56,242 --> 01:00:58,039
It never happened.

705
01:00:59,642 --> 01:01:02,998
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

706
01:01:03,162 --> 01:01:07,075
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood? Be my guest.

707
01:01:07,482 --> 01:01:08,597
How long?

708
01:01:09,802 --> 01:01:11,235
How long have we been alive?

709
01:01:12,642 --> 01:01:15,202
You're Echo generation, so you're 3.

710
01:01:17,002 --> 01:01:18,276
Delta means you're 4.

711
01:01:20,962 --> 01:01:22,077
Three?

712
01:01:22,242 --> 01:01:25,951
The whole reason you exist is because
everyone wants to live forever.

713
01:01:26,122 --> 01:01:27,635
It's the new American dream.

714
01:01:27,802 --> 01:01:31,078
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

715
01:01:31,282 --> 01:01:34,354
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

716
01:01:34,522 --> 01:01:38,640
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sac.

717
01:01:39,402 --> 01:01:43,315
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

718
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:46,713
He doesn't want anyone knowing
the truth. Especially not your sponsors.

719
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:50,478
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

720
01:01:50,642 --> 01:01:52,598
They, like, own you.

721
01:01:55,042 --> 01:02:00,162
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

722
01:02:00,642 --> 01:02:04,601
Just because people eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

723
01:02:05,842 --> 01:02:07,116
Besides...

724
01:02:07,282 --> 01:02:11,673
...do you know how many laws Merrick's
breaking to have you two hatched?

725
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:15,433
Your sponsors can't have
any part of that.

726
01:02:15,602 --> 01:02:18,070
They're, like, high society.
Rich and famous.

727
01:02:18,242 --> 01:02:20,358
If they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

728
01:02:20,522 --> 01:02:23,355
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the real truth.

729
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:24,836
- What? No.
- Yeah.

730
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:26,833
No. That's the worst idea
I ever heard.

731
01:02:27,002 --> 01:02:29,391
You know how dead I would be?
Not to mention fired?

732
01:02:29,602 --> 01:02:31,672
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

733
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:34,237
Stop! Fold, stop. Brakes.
No. Come on.

734
01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:36,791
You're like the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

735
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,920
They're not gonna care.
They don't care. They're gonna care?

736
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:42,313
You know what I would do
if I were you?

737
01:02:42,522 --> 01:02:45,832
I would get as far away from here
as I could. Go to the beach.

738
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:49,000
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

739
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:50,840
We're asking for your help.

740
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:54,120
Oh, God.

741
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:05,392
Infrared's having a hard time getting
a heat signature on our fugitives.

742
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:07,314
Sand's too hot.

743
01:03:10,642 --> 01:03:12,951
He was implanted
with microsensors yesterday.

744
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:16,798
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

745
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:20,039
- Lf we're within half a mile of the source.
- Do it.

746
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:22,996
Your sponsors' names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

747
01:03:23,162 --> 01:03:24,914
Her sponsor lives in New York.

748
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:27,550
The number in your name
is a regional code.

749
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:31,601
Six Echo, it means
your sponsor lives in L.A.

750
01:03:31,802 --> 01:03:33,713
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state.

751
01:03:33,922 --> 01:03:35,594
Yeah. Put this on. No, no, no.

752
01:03:35,762 --> 01:03:38,401
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

753
01:03:38,602 --> 01:03:41,162
Keep going. What size?

754
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:45,557
These are bags, okay?
You put stuff in them.

755
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:48,316
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

756
01:03:48,482 --> 01:03:49,756
We're not idiots.

757
01:03:49,922 --> 01:03:52,914
Excuse me, Miss I'm-So-Smart-
l-Can't-Wait-to-Go-to-The-lsland.

758
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:57,437
Yeah. Good.

759
01:04:03,682 --> 01:04:06,913
Wait. Hold. People don't really wear
these on the outside.

760
01:04:07,082 --> 01:04:10,154
These are mail-order, okay?
They stay here.

761
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,277
No. Mail-order, okay?
Clones don't wear these.

762
01:04:20,082 --> 01:04:21,356
All right. Listen up.

763
01:04:21,522 --> 01:04:24,116
This card is like stim credits.

764
01:04:24,282 --> 01:04:27,160
It'll get you food, but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours...

765
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:31,474
...or else they'll know I helped you.
After that, use the cash.

766
01:04:34,282 --> 01:04:38,275
All right, look. I know you're new to
this whole human experience and all...

767
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:40,319
...but there's one universal truth...

768
01:04:40,522 --> 01:04:43,400
...and that is you never give a woman
your credit card.

769
01:04:43,562 --> 01:04:45,075
Right.

770
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,521
I got something. It's hot.
