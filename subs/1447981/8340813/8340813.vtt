- I totally disagree.
- I love the hair.

356
00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:50.314
Aww, who's this lost little
doggy with her purple claws?

357
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:52.923
Who you calling little?

358
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.271
Okay, let's go
before she gives us mange.

359
00:17:59.054 --> 00:18:01.488
Clawdeen, there is
a very attractive monster

360
00:18:01.576 --> 00:18:03.663
staring at you.

361
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.402
- Oh. Uh...
- Hey.

362
00:18:06.489 --> 00:18:08.228
Standing up to Cleo like that?

363
00:18:08.315 --> 00:18:09.577
Courageous move.

364
00:18:09.664 --> 00:18:11.272
I'm Deuce.

365
00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:12.881
You're a Gorgon.

366
00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:15.881
Oh, yeah, but not necessarily
that kind of Gorgon.

367
00:18:15.968 --> 00:18:17.838
I've got a strict no snake bites

368
00:18:17.925 --> 00:18:19.925
or turning anyone
to stone policy.

369
00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:21.751
Thus, the slightly
pretentious glasses.

370
00:18:21.838 --> 00:18:23.751
- It's a good look.
- I'm Clawdeen.

371
00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.534
- I'm Frankie.
- I'm 16 days old.

372
00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:27.360
Nice to meet you both.

373
00:18:27.447 --> 00:18:30.229
And don't listen to Cleo.
She's got mummy issues.

374
00:18:30.316 --> 00:18:32.447
She was wrapped in linen
for a thousand years.

375
00:18:32.534 --> 00:18:34.490
Not great for the heart.

376
00:18:34.578 --> 00:18:36.100
I should know.
I dated her.

377
00:18:36.187 --> 00:18:38.317
My heart belonged
to a dead fisherman named Earl.

378
00:18:38.404 --> 00:18:40.579
You dated her?

379
00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:42.969
Uh, yeah,
but I'm trying not to be

380
00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:46.274
who I was anymore,
if that makes any sense.

381
00:18:46.361 --> 00:18:49.274
Weirdly, it does.

382
00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.361
Anyways, I'll see you around.

383
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.188
Clawdeen Wolf, please report
to the headmistress's office.

384
00:18:56.275 --> 00:19:00.275
Ooh, the headmistress,
she is so terrifying.

385
00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:02.927
I said Clawdeen Wolf,
to the headmistress's office!

386
00:19:03.014 --> 00:19:05.884
- I got this.
- Cool.

387
00:19:21.145 --> 00:19:24.668
- I hate Mondays, too.
- So early in the week.

388
00:19:24.755 --> 00:19:28.103
100% pure ogre bone, very rare.

389
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.755
It was given to me
by Joan of Arc after her death,

390
00:19:30.842 --> 00:19:33.146
of course,
which was on a Monday.

391
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.364
Is there a reason I'm here,
Headmistress Bloodgood?

392
00:19:38.451 --> 00:19:40.277
Yes, right.

393
00:19:40.364 --> 00:19:42.538
I just wanted
to welcome you personally.

394
00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:45.060
Your mother, well,

395
00:19:45.147 --> 00:19:47.104
a true monster heart
if there ever was one.

396
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:48.843
Out of respect for her,

397
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.452
I would like to bestow
upon you a great honor.

398
00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:53.234
Founder's Day is in a few weeks,

399
00:19:53.321 --> 00:19:55.452
the day we celebrate
the opening of the school

400
00:19:55.539 --> 00:19:56.800
when we liberated ourselves

401
00:19:56.887 --> 00:19:58.844
from the tyranny
of human society.

402
00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.931
There's an annual dinner,
very exclusive,

403
00:20:02.018 --> 00:20:05.279
for the school's most important
and generous officers,

404
00:20:05.366 --> 00:20:09.192
and I've selected you to be
the student ambassador to it.

405
00:20:09.279 --> 00:20:11.366
Really, me?

406
00:20:11.453 --> 00:20:13.974
Yes, many of the guests
were friends with your mother.

407
00:20:14.061 --> 00:20:15.932
You'll represent
the student body,

408
00:20:16.018 --> 00:20:18.366
say a few words about yourself,
your family.

409
00:20:18.453 --> 00:20:19.932
I'd be honored.

410
00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:23.453
- Wait, uh, my family?
- Which reminds me,

411
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.062
you didn't mention your father
on your application.

412
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:30.106
You do have a father, don't you?

413
00:20:30.193 --> 00:20:33.976
Oh, yes, his name is...

414
00:20:34.062 --> 00:20:35.367
Pierre.

415
00:20:35.454 --> 00:20:36.846
Pierre?

416
00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:40.324
That's not
a very monstrous name.

417
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.281
He isn't human, is he?

418
00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:48.803
Humans are the enemy,
always have been.

419
00:20:48.889 --> 00:20:50.455

421
00:20:52.673 --> 00:20:56.195
- No, not human.
- He is all werewolf.

422
00:20:56.281 --> 00:21:01.412
Pierre Wolf, he's French.

423
00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:04.890
Hmm, French werewolf,

424
00:21:04.977 --> 00:21:09.543
that's pretty rare
and very fascinating.

425

Yep, huge teeth, great cook.

426
00:21:13.499 --> 00:21:16.326
Oh, and his growl has this
adorable French twang to it.

427
00:21:16.412 --> 00:21:18.543
I do love a monster
with an accent.

428
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.650
I look forward to meeting him.

00:21:19.674 --> 00:21:22.152

Let's hear from you.

506
00:25:07.426 --> 00:25:10.209
Humans. Humans are the
greatest threat to monster kind.

507
00:25:10.296 --> 00:25:12.904
Exactly right, which is why

508
00:25:12.991 --> 00:25:15.644
they are banned
from Monster High.

509
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:18.079

exactly back to my point.

Hi, question,
for the first report,

597
00:29:12.614 --> 00:29:14.788
I was wondering if I could
do it on that Hyde guy?

598
00:29:14.875 --> 00:29:16.310
Mr. Komos, can I just say

599
00:29:16.397 --> 00:29:18.702
how excited I am
to be in your class?

600
00:29:18.788 --> 00:29:20.831
Oh, and that's great,
Cleo, thanks.

I think that's really cool.

603
00:29:24.658 --> 00:29:26.416
I also have some questions

604

I'm just gonna help Clawdeen
here for a sec,

605
00:29:27.963 --> 00:29:29.484

- No, thank you.

Yeah, this whole Hyde story
seems cool.

to cure his humanness.

619
00:30:02.704 --> 00:30:04.791
Made a potion that could ixnay
his human side,

620

before he could take it.
