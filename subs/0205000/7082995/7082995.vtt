00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.320
**Of all the wonderful things
in life you can find**

2
00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:21.404
**They all can be yours
with the right frame of mind**

3
00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:24.842
**Just look and you'll find
No run, no lie**

4
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.182
**There are no secrets to hide
No run, no lie**

5
00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.833
**Leave your problems behind
Leave your problems behind**

6
00:00:31.973 --> 00:00:34.314
**No worry, friends
No worry**

7
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.003
Yuck!

8
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.221
Eww!

9
00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:52.005
Swim trunks are loaded
with detergents...

10
00:00:52.092 --> 00:00:54.179
and other hazardous chemicals
that could be harmful to fish.

11
00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:56.093
Ow! Ah!

12
00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.110
Hi, Allison.

13
00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:49.114
-Just quit my job at the aquarium.
- Heard you got fired.

14
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.862
Yeah. Aquarium's totally changed,
but don't worry about me.

15
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.596
I'll be fine. You know,
I got a lot of great offers.

16
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.292
You know, things are really
starting to happen for me.

17
00:01:58.378 --> 00:01:59.945
- I was thinking, maybe later,
if you weren't doing..
- No.

18
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.250
I mean, uh, if you're..
when you're not workin'..

19
00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:04.599
I don't think so.

20
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.383
Okay, I guess I'll just, you know,
take some sea snails and be on my way.

21
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.909
No, no, a little lower.
The ones on the bottom.

22
00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:42.048
Uh.. Have a good nipple.

23
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.409
**Colour me your colour, baby**

24
00:03:12.974 --> 00:03:14.844
**Colour me your car**

25
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.238
**Colour me your colour, darling**

26
00:03:20.063 --> 00:03:21.673
**I know who you are**

27
00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:27.458
**Come up off your colour chart**
- Ah, you have beautiful skin, baby.

28
00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.677
Get some olive oil,
rub it all over you.

29
00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:37.462
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:41.840
Let's get him out of there.

31
00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:58.036
Oh! Oh, Antoine! Yeah!

32
00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:12.910
Yes!

33
00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.393
Try to keep your goldfish
in this bowl.

34
00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.003
If you like, I could
stick around for a while.

35
00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:28.569
Every kid needs a father.

36
00:04:42.096 --> 00:04:43.575
What the hell?

37
00:05:04.018 --> 00:05:04.889
What the hell are you doing?

38
00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:07.802
There's a mongrel koi in there.

39
00:05:08.193 --> 00:05:10.195
It's the most dangerous
of all goldfish.

40
00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:13.152
Do you have any ice?

41
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.197
Hey! Shoes off, huh?

42
00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:19.806
Respect the 18th-century
Persian carpet.

43
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.767
Whoa! What are those?

44
00:05:27.854 --> 00:05:30.072
Medieval weapons.
I'm a collector.

45
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:34.118
They're worth twice as much
If they've killed somebody.

46
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:40.077
I collect Canadian quarters.

47
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:42.250
I got about six of them.

48
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.645
Would you like anything to drink?

49
00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:52.385
I wouldn't mind a glass of..

50
00:05:53.038 --> 00:05:55.300
Whoa. What is that?

51
00:05:56.474 --> 00:05:59.475
Is that a custom Living Colour,
anti-glare, retractable-top tank?

52
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.085
- I'm not sure.
- It is.

53
00:06:03.477 --> 00:06:04.825
They assemble
each one of these by hand.

54
00:06:05.652 --> 00:06:09.001
Whoa. Chinese tail bar lionfish.
He's a beauty.

55
00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:10.959
That's an $800 fish!

56
00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:15.307
- Try a grand.
- Well, then you overpaid.

57
00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:21.614
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

58
00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:23.398
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy.

59
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:26.399
Hey, an Australian rainbow fish.

60
00:06:27.442 --> 00:06:28.792
You're not gonna wanna
put him in there.

61
00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:33.315
- Oh, God!
- Women love it.

62
00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:36.620
They find it erotic
when they eat each other.

63
00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:40.318
Excuse me for a second, huh?

64
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.883
Must make pee-pee.

65
00:06:58.194 --> 00:07:02.022
Antoine, hi. It's Regina. I'm flying in
from Luxembourg tomorrow.

66
00:07:02.152 --> 00:07:05.067
I want you to be my driver.
SwissAir, flight 12.

67
00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:08.155
Is it still 3,500?
See you. Ciao.

68
00:07:11.242 --> 00:07:13.549
I finally figured out how you
pick up all these gorgeous women.

69
00:07:14.374 --> 00:07:17.028
- How's that?
- You're a limo driver.

70
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.507
Sometimes I am.

71
00:07:21.116 --> 00:07:22.725
So you just drive them back here
and have sex with them?

72
00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:25.118
If they pay me enough, yes.

73
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:27.467
What kind of limo service is that?

74
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:31.431
Shouldn't you be taking them
to fancy restaurants or the theatre?

75
00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:36.312
- I'm a gigolo.
- A gigo-who?

76
00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:40.822
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

77
00:07:45.658 --> 00:07:47.135
How'd you get that job?

78
00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:49.753
I just kind of fell into it.

79
00:07:51.602 --> 00:07:53.616
I'm gonna kill
my guidance counsellor.

80
00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:03.794
Hey! Hey! Hey!

81
00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:17.924
Down! Bad dog!

82
00:08:25.947 --> 00:08:28.363
Hey, guys.
Did you miss me?

83
00:08:35.194 --> 00:08:39.430
Well, there's been a slight delay
in our move-to-the-beach plan.

84
00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:43.224
But don't worry.

85
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.678
It's gonna happen.

86
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.962
Hey, fish guy!

87
00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:01.615
I think there's something wrong
with my, uh...

88
00:09:01.787 --> 00:09:03.872
uh, duh, duh, big fish.

89
00:09:13.258 --> 00:09:16.179
PH is off. The nitrates
are at a dangerous level.

90
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.628
I can neutralize it.

91
00:09:18.472 --> 00:09:20.605
Oh, hey, fishy, fishy, fishy.

92
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.525
They don't like that.

93
00:09:26.744 --> 00:09:28.066
I think our little friend
has Malawi bloat.

94
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:31.299
- What the hell is that?
- It's a gill disorder.

95
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.938
Is it bad?

96
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.783
- Could be fatal.
- But is he gonna make it?

97
00:09:36.983 --> 00:09:41.015
He's in shock. I gave him
some freeze-dried water fleas,
but he's gotta wanna live.

98
00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:43.639
- The next 48 hours are critical.
- Forty-eight hours?

99
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.419
But I got to go to Switzerland
for business.

100
00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:49.163
- I'll be gone for three weeks.
- Well, cancel it.

101
00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:52.461
- You got a sick fish here, pal.
- Hey, hey, what about you, huh?

102
00:09:53.408 --> 00:09:56.015
Sounds good, but I can't afford to go to
Europe right now. My passport expired..

103
00:09:56.537 --> 00:09:59.419
No, no. I mean you can stay here
and look after my fish, huh?

104
00:09:59.873 --> 00:10:01.713
No, I've got a full bar, huh?

105
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.443
Digital television.
You're on the beach.

106
00:10:06.653 --> 00:10:07.928
I don't know. I..

107
00:10:14.578 --> 00:10:17.085
I would be honoured
to care for your fish.

108
00:10:31.472 --> 00:10:32.850
Just remember.

109
00:10:33.557 --> 00:10:36.888
Don't use my car
and don't answer my phone.

110
00:10:37.729 --> 00:10:39.528
No car, no phone.

111
00:10:40.337 --> 00:10:42.881
So I guess throwing a big beach party
is out of the question, huh?

112
00:10:46.594 --> 00:10:49.662
This is a 14th-century
Hungarian crossbow.

113
00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:53.956
It has killed a king
and changed the history of Europe.

114
00:10:55.457 --> 00:10:57.224
You mess up anything
in my apartment...

115
00:10:57.752 --> 00:10:59.379
I'll shove it up your ass.

116
00:11:01.402 --> 00:11:02.973
Have a good trip.

117
00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:13.485
**Come on, come on**

118
00:11:17.357 --> 00:11:20.841
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

119
00:11:27.994 --> 00:11:30.139
**Come on, come on**

120
00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:32.977
**And tell me why you're standing**

121
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.939
**Come on, come on**

122
00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:38.072
**It must be
Why you're demanding**

123
00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:39.564
**Come on, come on**

124
00:11:42.386 --> 00:11:44.388
**Come on, come on**

125
00:11:46.036 --> 00:11:48.616
**And stop**
- I'm on the beach.

126
00:11:48.852 --> 00:11:51.250
I mean, I open up my window,
I got sand blowin' in my face.

127
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.858
It's that crazy.
I'd love to show it to you sometime.

128
00:11:53.997 --> 00:11:55.943
- No.
- You really owe it yourself to see..

129
00:11:56.052 --> 00:11:57.298
- No.
- Hey!

130
00:11:58.028 --> 00:12:00.110
Try to get laid
on your own time, pal.

131
00:12:00.844 --> 00:12:03.208
- Yeah, come on!
- Let's go, pal. Really.

132
00:12:03.451 --> 00:12:05.289
I guess I'll just take
some sea snails.

133
00:12:07.414 --> 00:12:09.773
You better give me some
from the colder tank.

134
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.428
Oh!

135
00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:00.153
Oh! Oh, yes!

136
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.956
Oh!

137
00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:04.829
I've been bad.

138
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:06.336
I've been really bad.

139
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:09.172
Oh! Ah!

140
00:13:09.985 --> 00:13:12.235
But it was worth it.

141
00:13:13.635 --> 00:13:16.908
Hi. Would you like to buy
some Girls of America cookies?

142
00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:20.513
- Don't hit me with that.
- Could you come back later?

143
00:13:21.456 --> 00:13:23.990
- Ohh!
- Eww! What are you watching?

144
00:13:25.107 --> 00:13:29.124
You're gross! You're a sick man,
and I'm gonna tell!

145
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:31.205
- Hit me with it again!
- How much?

146
00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:07.427
Great.

147
00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:48.197
Hey, uh, Deuce, it's Antoine.

148
00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:51.096
I just realized
I don't know you that well.

149
00:14:51.663 --> 00:14:53.435
To be honest,
it's freaking me out a little.

150
00:14:54.064 --> 00:14:57.336
You just make sure you keep my apartment
clean, or you will die! Bye-bye.

151
00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:57.641
Six thousand dollars?

152
00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:00.330
I know. It sucks.

153
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.579
- Neil, where am I gonna get
$6,000 in three weeks?
- I don't know your budget.

154
00:16:06.227 --> 00:16:09.786
You may not want to blow
your whole wad on this tank.

155
00:16:11.442 --> 00:16:12.608
I would.

156
00:16:13.944 --> 00:16:16.692
- Can I pay in instalments?
- No.

157
00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:20.408
I'm up to my bicep in it,
If you know what I mean.

158
00:16:21.348 --> 00:16:24.489
I'm not trying to flip you over
and do you dry here.

159
00:16:24.998 --> 00:16:28.724
Look. Squat on it for a night,
and let me know.

160
00:16:56.284 --> 00:16:58.414
- What? Hello?
- Hi.

161
00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:03.159
I've been staring at your number
For hours. I got it from a friend.

162
00:17:03.793 --> 00:17:07.501
Um, I'm not really
supposed to use this phone.

163
00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:11.989
Why don't you come over?
My address is 1235 Radford Way.

164
00:17:12.343 --> 00:17:17.340
Actually, uh, I've.. I've got
a lot of work to do here still.

165
00:17:18.183 --> 00:17:19.588
I'm naked.

166
00:17:21.312 --> 00:17:22.355
**Call me
Call me**

167
00:17:22.899 --> 00:17:23.710
**On the line**

168
00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:27.733
**Call me, call me
any, anytime**

169
00:17:28.091 --> 00:17:29.008
**Call me**

170
00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:40.518
Now there's my little
German tourist.

171
00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:44.862
Is this it?
Is this the whole outfit?

172
00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:47.281
It's perfect.

173
00:17:58.543 --> 00:18:02.787
Yes. Use the map.
Use the map.

174
00:18:08.707 --> 00:18:12.918
"Vohrest der
Statue of Liberty?"

175
00:18:13.663 --> 00:18:16.269
You should have stuck
with the tour, Heinz.

176
00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:19.095
Now you'll have to
pay the penalty.

177
00:18:21.172 --> 00:18:23.692
It's.. It's no problem.
I'll just, um..

178
00:18:24.926 --> 00:18:27.717
Let me slip on
a few of these babies.

179
00:18:34.312 --> 00:18:37.435
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

180
00:18:37.962 --> 00:18:42.566
Now, come here,
you naughty little sightseer.

181
00:18:47.869 --> 00:18:51.519
- Wait a second.
I definitely heard something!
- Oh, that's just Wolfy.

182
00:18:51.772 --> 00:18:55.378
He's been in there a while. Now,
you concentrate and stay in character.

183
00:18:57.255 --> 00:18:59.602
Wolfy, settle down!

184
00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:02.675
Now, you just focus
on your little Wiener schnitzel.

185
00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.416
I gotta get outta here.

186
00:19:07.683 --> 00:19:09.647
Don't worry. He never
gets all the way through.

187
00:19:11.021 --> 00:19:11.857
Maybe you better go.

188
00:19:16.025 --> 00:19:18.633
Wolfy has got to stop
doing this to Mommy's friends!

189
00:19:18.882 --> 00:19:21.185
Yes, he does.
Yes, he does.

190
00:19:22.284 --> 00:19:25.400
He'll be all right for a while. Here,
this is for you. It's all I could grab.

191
00:19:26.454 --> 00:19:29.116
- Did I bring you pleasure?
- Not really.

192
00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:30.611
Y-Y-You better haul ass.

193
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.276
Ten dollars?

194
00:19:51.692 --> 00:19:53.391
Yeah!

195
00:20:01.912 --> 00:20:04.641
**Well, you can tell
by the way I roll shorty**

196
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.273
**That I'm a ladies' man
A businessman**

197
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.211
**I keep it intact
Yo, Clef**

198
00:20:09.628 --> 00:20:12.340
**Do the track with John
Play the mack while I pay the taxi**

199
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.721
**Business as usual
watchin' suspects**

200
00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:17.134
**Steal my assets**
- Martini and two olives.

201
00:20:17.554 --> 00:20:20.715
**Drink sat the bar**
- Martini. Two olives.

202
00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:23.919
Any ladies need
some entertainment tonight?

203
00:20:24.437 --> 00:20:25.563
He's kind of cute.

204
00:20:35.283 --> 00:20:37.294
Eight-fifty.

205
00:20:39.975 --> 00:20:42.954
- Eight dollars?
- And fifty cents.

206
00:20:44.668 --> 00:20:47.263
Well, how much just for
a plain cranberry juice?

207
00:20:48.202 --> 00:20:49.063
Oh, uh, three dollars.

208
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.700
I'll go for that.

209
00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:58.340
There you go.
That's, uh, eleven-fifty.

210
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:02.266
Uh, no, no.
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

211
00:21:02.709 --> 00:21:05.679
I wish to cancel my original order
Of the martini and two olives...

212
00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:10.069
and go for just the plain cranberry
juice, by itself, for the three dollars.

213
00:21:10.427 --> 00:21:12.899
And I apologize for any inconvenience
this may have caused you.

214
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:14.702
Uh, perhaps you don't understand.

215
00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:17.452
Uh, if you don't pay me now,
I'm going to, uh...

216
00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:20.348
I'm gonna take this swizzle stick
and, uh...

217
00:21:20.736 --> 00:21:22.145
I'll be shovin' that
right up your pee hole.

218
00:21:23.254 --> 00:21:26.433
**Stayin' alive**
- So that was eleven-fiifty, right?

219
00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:28.474
- Right.
- Okay.

220
00:21:28.676 --> 00:21:32.315
There's ten and six quarters.

221
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.881
And, uh, tell you what.
I'll go work on your tip.

222
00:21:43.798 --> 00:21:45.756
I couldn't help
overhearing your Spanish.

223
00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:48.027
It's French.

224
00:21:50.368 --> 00:21:53.642
French. Nice people.
May l?

225
00:21:54.018 --> 00:21:55.582
No..

226
00:21:57.668 --> 00:21:58.710
Oop.

227
00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:01.456
These leather seats.

228
00:22:02.361 --> 00:22:04.876
Would you like a martini
or cranberry juice?

229
00:22:04.968 --> 00:22:05.907
No.

230
00:22:07.054 --> 00:22:08.221
Kinda celebrating tonight.

231
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.117
Possible career change.

232
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.510
- I'm pretty excited about it.
- You wanna get outta here?

233
00:22:24.782 --> 00:22:25.769
Okay. I'm sorry.

234
00:22:26.868 --> 00:22:28.549
I mean, together.

235
00:22:40.842 --> 00:22:42.137
What happened to the carpet?

236
00:22:42.719 --> 00:22:46.662
Oh, it's, uh, one of those
18th-century wet rugs.

237
00:22:56.068 --> 00:22:58.271
Oh, that's certainly appreciated.

238
00:23:00.238 --> 00:23:01.052
Hey, whoa.

239
00:23:02.325 --> 00:23:04.774
Maybe we should take care
Of a little business first.

240
00:23:05.974 --> 00:23:07.262
If you prefer.

241
00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:11.374
I don't have a set price or anything,
but I have been getting ten dollars.

242
00:23:12.753 --> 00:23:15.798
- I'm sorry?
- Well, that's my going rate.

243
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:17.511
But I'm willing to negotiate.

244
00:23:20.584 --> 00:23:23.553
That's funny.
But the price is 500.

245
00:23:24.225 --> 00:23:26.797
You're gonna pay me $500?

246
00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:30.336
No, honey, you pay me.

247
00:23:32.254 --> 00:23:35.140
Oh, I get it. This is
some kind of role reversal.

248
00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:38.824
I'll play along with this.
Okay, 300, 400, 500.

249
00:23:39.587 --> 00:23:40.702
You're my hooker.

250
00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.774
No, seriously,
where's my ten dollars?

251
00:23:43.517 --> 00:23:46.655
Look, asshole, I didn't come
all the way down here for nothin'.

252
00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:50.211
Now, give me my $500!

253
00:23:50.712 --> 00:23:53.482
You give me ten dollars!

254
00:23:54.385 --> 00:23:55.782
500, now!

255
00:23:58.416 --> 00:24:00.643
You pay me ten dollars.

256
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.268
Nice. Oh!

257
00:24:16.367 --> 00:24:17.853
Is that all you got?

258
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.507
Ten dollars!

259
00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:50.683
No! Please, don't!

260
00:24:51.361 --> 00:24:53.757
Five hundred dollars,
or the fish gets it.

261
00:24:54.464 --> 00:24:55.309
Let's talk about this.

262
00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:09.090
- Why do you have a picture of Antoine?
- Well, this is his place. 
I'm watchin' his fish for him.

263
00:25:13.724 --> 00:25:17.298
Please, don't tell him
about the shoes, huh?

264
00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:41.444
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Oh, my God.

265
00:25:42.715 --> 00:25:43.908
I'm lookin' at a dead man.

266
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.393
You know, Claire told me
that Antoine's place was messed up...

267
00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:51.457
but I had no idea.

268
00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:54.554
- Claire?
- The hooker you ass-punched.

269
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:56.309
That was a misunderstanding...

270
00:25:57.002 --> 00:26:01.073
and I intend to have everything fiixed
by the time Antoine gets back.

271
00:26:02.008 --> 00:26:05.089
I'm just.. just a little
strapped for cash right now.

272
00:26:06.388 --> 00:26:07.582
Maybe there's something
we could work out.

273
00:26:08.161 --> 00:26:10.252
Claire mentioned
that you dabbled in harlotry.

274
00:26:11.338 --> 00:26:13.175
- I'm sorry?
- You a man-whore.

275
00:26:13.688 --> 00:26:15.763
- Well, I tried that for a couple hours..
- See this ring?

276
00:26:16.294 --> 00:26:17.801
Topaz.
That's my mother's birthstone.

277
00:26:18.338 --> 00:26:19.346
Got that from man-whorin'.

278
00:26:20.153 --> 00:26:22.306
See this key chain?
That's right.

279
00:26:23.074 --> 00:26:25.524
Mini yo-yo.
Know how I got the money for that?

280
00:26:26.202 --> 00:26:27.219
- Man-whorin'?
- Stock market.

281
00:26:27.766 --> 00:26:30.100
But I got the money for the stock market
from man-whorin'...

282
00:26:30.895 --> 00:26:32.684
and representin'
man-whores like yourself.

283
00:26:35.066 --> 00:26:38.477
- So, you're a pimp?
- T.J. don't consider himself no pimp.

284
00:26:39.421 --> 00:26:41.345
More of a male madam.

285
00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:45.363
That wasn't too well thought out.

286
00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:50.354
Look at this proud fish.
It's like a coyote. King of the jungle.

287
00:26:51.287 --> 00:26:53.322
Just like Antoine.
He don't need no pimp.

288
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.958
Now look at this
mid-level fish here.

289
00:26:57.279 --> 00:27:00.197
Works hotels, conventions,
senior centres.

290
00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:03.571
I represent several man-whores
 at this level of the game.

291
00:27:05.309 --> 00:27:06.689
Now look at this little fella.

292
00:27:07.395 --> 00:27:10.523
At the bottom, tryin' to get busy
with the scuba man.

293
00:27:11.774 --> 00:27:14.492
You know, if you work hard
and listen to me...

294
00:27:15.737 --> 00:27:17.091
this could be you.

295
00:27:17.823 --> 00:27:21.468
Well, thanks,
but I already have a job.

296
00:27:23.037 --> 00:27:26.517
- I clean fish tanks.
- You ever make $150
cleanin' fish tanks?

297
00:27:26.687 --> 00:27:28.651
- A hundred and fiifty dollars?
- Yeah.

298
00:27:29.248 --> 00:27:30.516
Fish ain't gonna pay
for all this.

299
00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:34.536
I don't know.

300
00:27:36.073 --> 00:27:37.943
You know, Antoine's
got a bad temper.

301
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.857
Remember once I dropped
a cigar ash on his rug.

302
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.150
He made me pick it up
with my anus.

303
00:27:47.023 --> 00:27:49.604
Well, maybe I could
do a couple jobs...

304
00:27:51.188 --> 00:27:52.366
just to get
this place fiixed up.

305
00:28:05.794 --> 00:28:07.279
We got a lot of work to do.

306
00:28:17.382 --> 00:28:19.400
**I believe in miracles**

307
00:28:21.229 --> 00:28:22.478
**Where you from**

308
00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:25.750
**You sexy thing
Sexy thing, you**

309
00:28:26.652 --> 00:28:28.460
**I believe in miracles**

310
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.475
**Since you came along**

311
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.159
You a man-whore now.

312
00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:08.405
- I'm so proud.
- Thanks, T.J.

313
00:29:09.365 --> 00:29:11.011
Now, remember, it's business.

314
00:29:12.537 --> 00:29:14.496
Never, ever fall in love.

315
00:29:37.565 --> 00:29:40.322
I'm upstairs!

316
00:29:58.422 --> 00:30:02.130
Okay, Deuce,
don't fall in love.

317
00:30:14.065 --> 00:30:15.955
I know what you're thinkin'.

318
00:30:17.714 --> 00:30:22.255
You're thinkin' those are
the biggest boobies you've ever seen.

319
00:30:22.929 --> 00:30:24.095
Can I please use your phone?

320
00:30:24.494 --> 00:30:25.506
I'm not your average woman.

321
00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:29.506
I like sex,
and I'm not afraid to admit..

322
00:30:33.879 --> 00:30:36.361
Excuse me.
I just had pudding an hour ago.

323
00:30:36.963 --> 00:30:40.739
- Dear God!
- You ever parked your bicycle
in an aeroplane hangar?

324
00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:43.880
- I'm sorry?
- You ever thrown an toothpick...

325
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.225
into a volcano?

326
00:30:46.915 --> 00:30:49.050
- What?
- Oh, nothin'.

327
00:30:49.939 --> 00:30:53.590
Just makin' idle chit-chat.
Are you comfortable?

328
00:30:54.215 --> 00:30:56.449
- Actually, no.
- Ooh.

329
00:30:57.134 --> 00:31:00.488
I'm sweatin'.
You're gettin' me all hot.

330
00:31:01.514 --> 00:31:04.964
- You don't like my hair, do you?
- I think there's been a mistake.

331
00:31:05.165 --> 00:31:07.563
- Did you say "steak"?
- No mistake.

332
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.302
- Oh, see, now you got me all excited.
- Look, I'm gay.

333
00:31:11.943 --> 00:31:15.072
- Well, how gay are you?
- Very, very gay.

334
00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:16.636
You must have dialled
the Very Gay Escort Service.

335
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.558
Oh, shit. See, sometimes
my fingers swell up...

336
00:31:20.808 --> 00:31:22.893
and I can't cleanly
hit the numbers.

337
00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:26.114
They should make a phone
for full-figured girls.

338
00:31:26.543 --> 00:31:28.347
- They should.
- So...

339
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.291
what do we do?

340
00:31:34.886 --> 00:31:38.536
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

341
00:31:38.632 --> 00:31:41.771
Cakes and Pies.
Cakes and Pies!

342
00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:44.784
Okay, which pie
has the most sugar?

343
00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:49.030
- Peach cobbler.
- You win again.
That's four games to one.

344
00:31:49.486 --> 00:31:52.285
Well, fast food trivia
is my game, honey.

345
00:31:55.222 --> 00:31:58.585
I must tell you, nobody has ever
pleasured Jabba the Slut.

346
00:31:59.393 --> 00:32:00.957
Deucey, you have a way
of satisfying a woman...

347
00:32:01.412 --> 00:32:03.272
that would sicken a normal man.

348
00:32:04.085 --> 00:32:05.181
I can't do this any more.

349
00:32:05.963 --> 00:32:07.972
You must have
a magical "man-gina."

350
00:32:08.778 --> 00:32:09.975
- Huh?
- "Man-gina."

351
00:32:10.447 --> 00:32:14.980
It's a professional term we man-whores
use to describe our he-pussy.

352
00:32:15.765 --> 00:32:17.574
I'm not one of your man-whores.

353
00:32:18.164 --> 00:32:18.947
Okay? I quit.

354
00:32:19.207 --> 00:32:21.159
You ungrateful he-bitch.

355
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.379
How 'bout I get Antoine on the phone
in Switzerland...

356
00:32:23.894 --> 00:32:26.633
and tell him how you
redecorated his poon palace?

357
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:29.057
I'm not an ungrateful he-bitch.

358
00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:32.344
Just give me a minute
to think here.

359
00:32:58.835 --> 00:32:59.878
Thanks.

360
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:02.827
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

361
00:33:03.632 --> 00:33:06.388
- Hey, Dad, let me ask you a question.
- And what's that, son?

362
00:33:06.657 --> 00:33:09.785
Do you think it's wrong for a man
to accept money from a woman...

363
00:33:10.005 --> 00:33:12.473
to, you know,
show her a good time?

364
00:33:12.601 --> 00:33:14.808
I was just thinking about that
this morning.

365
00:33:14.895 --> 00:33:18.698
The idea of a man-whore
is a relatively new idea.

366
00:33:20.944 --> 00:33:23.303
- Cologne?
- No, thanks.

367
00:33:24.385 --> 00:33:27.395
These women are looking
for something more than just sex.

368
00:33:28.035 --> 00:33:30.379
- They want romance.
- What do you mean?

369
00:33:31.685 --> 00:33:34.307
Well, it was like
when I met your mom.

370
00:33:34.501 --> 00:33:35.671
God rest her soul.

371
00:33:36.225 --> 00:33:38.385
I didn't have so much
as a toilet to clean.

372
00:33:38.672 --> 00:33:42.879
Still, I wasn't going to pay her
 a dime for sex, no matter what
 she was charging.

373
00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.199
What?

374
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.980
Well, your mom could have had
any man she wanted in that strip club...

375
00:33:48.371 --> 00:33:52.234
and this being my first time in Bangkok,
I was looking for a good time myself.

376
00:33:52.542 --> 00:33:54.651
- You met Mom where?
- Oh, it's not important.

377
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:57.277
The thing is,
she saw something in me...

378
00:33:57.861 --> 00:33:59.327
beyond the 200 baht..

379
00:34:00.363 --> 00:34:01.994
a man with an eye
for adventure...

380
00:34:02.658 --> 00:34:04.110
who wasn't afraid
to risk it all.

381
00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:06.434
Dad, are.. are you saying that..

382
00:34:10.792 --> 00:34:13.516
So, we took all
her one-dollar bills off the stage...

383
00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:15.607
said goodbye to that donkey...

384
00:34:16.215 --> 00:34:18.981
and two days later,
we were man and wife.

385
00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:22.141
And we were happily married,
long time.

386
00:34:23.056 --> 00:34:26.284
So, do you think I should be
more of a risk-taker?

387
00:34:27.396 --> 00:34:28.228
Worked for me.

388
00:34:29.622 --> 00:34:30.697
Thanks, Pops.

389
00:34:34.777 --> 00:34:35.799
Well, son...

390
00:34:37.698 --> 00:34:39.430
Looks like I've got
some work to do.

391
00:34:45.206 --> 00:34:46.716
You got yourself a man-whore.

392
00:34:48.648 --> 00:34:49.831
My man!

393
00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:05.203
- Is.. Is Tina here?
- Yes.

394
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.459
I'm Deuce Bigalow, her date.

395
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:10.166
I get my things.

396
00:35:15.971 --> 00:35:17.361
I love this place.

397
00:35:18.577 --> 00:35:20.778
- Where you from again?
- Norway.

398
00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:23.468
- Freak!
- I hear great things about it.

399
00:35:24.242 --> 00:35:27.048
- Holy shit, it's Bigfoot!
- So how'd you end up here?

400
00:35:27.129 --> 00:35:30.943
I had a pituitary gland procedure
at UCLA Medical Centre...

401
00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:33.178
and I just fell in love
with the people here.

402
00:35:33.193 --> 00:35:36.997
- Hey, keep it in the circus!
- You know, this place has
 gone way downhill.

403
00:35:37.557 --> 00:35:40.261
- What do you say we go somewhere else?
- That's a huge bitch!

404
00:35:42.771 --> 00:35:44.858
I'm sorry about
what those people said.

405
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.635
You should be able to go
on all the rides.

406
00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.637
I had a really great time,
but I should go.

407
00:35:55.078 --> 00:35:58.546
Easy. Easy!
Take it easy!

408
00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:00.813
Wait, wait.

409
00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:04.005
Wait. Hey, I know
what we can do.

410
00:36:05.505 --> 00:36:07.802
I got it. Give me
a second to think here!

411
00:36:09.155 --> 00:36:10.689
Wait! Whoa!

412
00:36:11.972 --> 00:36:14.137
Oh, yes! Oh!

413
00:36:15.412 --> 00:36:16.551
Mmm!

414
00:36:26.362 --> 00:36:29.780
Oh, no one has ever
touched my feet before.

415
00:36:45.134 --> 00:36:47.889
Deuce Bigalow?
Detective Fowler, L.A.P.D.

416
00:36:48.992 --> 00:36:51.497
I wanna ask you a few questions
about Antoine Laconte...

417
00:36:52.017 --> 00:36:54.690
known gigolo, male prostitute.

418
00:36:56.083 --> 00:37:00.035
- I'm just taking care of his fish.
- I'll bet you are.

419
00:37:01.193 --> 00:37:02.360
You make me sick!

420
00:37:02.863 --> 00:37:05.138
You gonna stand there and tell me
that gigantic woman...

421
00:37:05.469 --> 00:37:07.364
didn't just pay you
to have sex with her?

422
00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:09.724
- No.
- Let me tell you something, mister.

423
00:37:10.162 --> 00:37:14.485
I can sleep at night, because I make
a decent, God-fearin', honest livin'.

424
00:37:14.751 --> 00:37:17.453
I'm sure you do,
but there's nothing I can tell you.

425
00:37:17.775 --> 00:37:18.702
I think there is.

426
00:37:19.548 --> 00:37:20.317
What do you think of this?

427
00:37:21.112 --> 00:37:24.005
- You think I can get anything
for it? You know, money?
- I don't know.

428
00:37:24.763 --> 00:37:27.195
Yeah. You think
I'm a loser, don't you?

429
00:37:27.474 --> 00:37:29.702
- No, I don't.
- Well, maybe I am a loser...

430
00:37:30.224 --> 00:37:31.872
but I'm a loser
who can bust your ass.

431
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:36.339
Now you tell Antoine
I'm gonna nail him.

432
00:37:54.484 --> 00:37:56.466
- Hello?
- Is this Ruth?

433
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.826
Yeah, I'll be right down.
Goddamn it!

434
00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:02.341
- Nice day, huh?
- Yeah.

435
00:38:03.452 --> 00:38:04.699
Shove it up your ass!

436
00:38:09.605 --> 00:38:11.376
Jeez, you okay?

437
00:38:11.691 --> 00:38:14.506
I'm sorry.
I have Tourette's syndrome...

438
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.959
and it causes me to have
these uncontrollable outbursts.

439
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.077
- It's not so bad.
- Yeah. It's okay.

440
00:38:21.117 --> 00:38:22.452
I mean, you get used to it.

441
00:38:23.162 --> 00:38:26.660
Ball sweat! Anus!
Anus licker!

442
00:38:28.689 --> 00:38:33.751
You know, there are some places
I can't go! Nipple biter!

443
00:38:36.197 --> 00:38:39.199
What are you talkin' about?
I barely notice it.

444
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.796
Scrotum! Sperm!
Sperm face!

445
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:49.409
I just can't go near places
like churches. Ha-ha! Vulva!

446
00:38:50.276 --> 00:38:52.937
Elementary schools.
Jizz! Jizz trap!

447
00:38:53.717 --> 00:38:54.986
Pretty much anywhere.

448
00:38:56.012 --> 00:38:57.369
Fart! Dildo!

449
00:38:58.097 --> 00:38:59.913
Big.. Big, big titties!

450
00:39:00.961 --> 00:39:03.520
Shit! Shit whore!

451
00:39:03.739 --> 00:39:06.748
Hey, uh, let's put the top up.
I'll put on the air conditioning.

452
00:39:10.925 --> 00:39:12.772
You probably want to
take me home, don't you?

453
00:39:13.844 --> 00:39:15.554
No.

454
00:39:16.556 --> 00:39:17.986
Hey, I got an idea.

455
00:39:23.856 --> 00:39:25.962
I'm nervous.
There's a lot of people here.

456
00:39:26.567 --> 00:39:27.710
- Don't worry.
- Crap muncher!

457
00:39:29.372 --> 00:39:30.222
- "Crap muncher"?
- I know!

458
00:39:30.426 --> 00:39:31.566
He was definitely safe!

459
00:39:32.615 --> 00:39:35.519
- Hey, what do you think
about the other team?
- Assholes!

460
00:39:35.927 --> 00:39:36.674
- Hey, keep it down.
- Right.

461
00:39:37.413 --> 00:39:41.490
And.. And their pitcher. I mean,
stop stalling and throw it already.

462
00:39:41.793 --> 00:39:43.982
- Ball hair!
- "Ball hair"?
- Ball hair!

463
00:39:44.638 --> 00:39:45.818
Yeah, ball hair.

464
00:39:46.277 --> 00:39:48.654
What we need is
a strike hair.

465
00:39:49.718 --> 00:39:52.161
That other team's
a bunch of high-priced babies!

466
00:39:52.504 --> 00:39:54.642
- Whores!
- Yeah! You tell 'em, darlin'!

467
00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:02.767
- They called him out?
- S-Scrotum licker!

468
00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.318
- Yeah!
- Scrotum licker!

469
00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:07.122
Piss face! Piss face! Piss face!

470
00:40:07.343 --> 00:40:08.536
Piss face! Piss face!

471
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.259
Piss face! Piss face!
Piss face! Piss face!

472
00:40:11.598 --> 00:40:14.226
Piss face! Piss face! Piss face!

473
00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:20.195
Deucey, you the best he-bitch
in my man-stable.

474
00:40:21.004 --> 00:40:23.617
If I had two more "man-ginas" like you,
I'd be a millionaire.

475
00:40:24.654 --> 00:40:27.312
- T.J., I think I'm gonna get out.
- Sit down.

476
00:40:27.782 --> 00:40:30.832
This next date is what we man-pimps
call a doozy.

477
00:40:31.902 --> 00:40:33.928
- What's wrong with this one?
- Nothin'.

478
00:40:34.561 --> 00:40:37.820
Have you seen her?
What is she, 80? Hunchbacked?

479
00:40:38.732 --> 00:40:39.747
She just got outta college.

480
00:40:39.984 --> 00:40:42.678
Some of her girlfriends pitched in
to get her a little beefcake.

481
00:40:42.904 --> 00:40:45.877
- She thinks it's a blind date.
- It's a guy, isn't it?

482
00:40:47.597 --> 00:40:51.152
I don't think so,
but I have been fooled before.

483
00:41:14.189 --> 00:41:17.023
- You must be Kate.
- Excuse me. Waiter.

484
00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:20.259
Ah. Uh, yes. Sorry.
We're busy tonight.

485
00:41:20.343 --> 00:41:21.073
I'll have the..

486
00:41:22.235 --> 00:41:24.096
- A number four?
- Yes. Thank you.

487
00:41:29.832 --> 00:41:31.931
- I'm Kate.
- Are you sure?

488
00:41:32.961 --> 00:41:36.922
- Think so.
- I'm sorry. You're just
not what I expected.

489
00:41:37.758 --> 00:41:40.149
- Really.
- No, no.

490
00:41:40.886 --> 00:41:42.775
I mean, in, uh..
in a good way.

491
00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:47.837
They didn't say
you were so perfect.

492
00:41:49.179 --> 00:41:50.102
"Perfect."

493
00:41:51.419 --> 00:41:53.788
So, Sally and Megan
didn't tell me a lot about you.

494
00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.617
Who?

495
00:41:56.946 --> 00:42:01.624
Oh, right, uh..
Well, I clean, uh, tanks.. ers..

496
00:42:02.473 --> 00:42:03.293
Tankers.

497
00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:06.205
I'm sorry.
I'm still kinda shocked.

498
00:42:06.854 --> 00:42:09.390
I mean, you're..
you're really normal.

499
00:42:11.071 --> 00:42:12.172
Thank you.

500
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:15.455
My last couple of dates
have been horrible.

501
00:42:15.717 --> 00:42:17.276
Oh, you get fixed up
on a lot of blind dates?

502
00:42:18.325 --> 00:42:19.356
Only recently.

503
00:42:20.919 --> 00:42:23.055
- H-How 'bout you?
- This is my first.

504
00:42:24.061 --> 00:42:27.724
- I hope this place is okay.
- Are you kidding? It's terrific.

505
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.515
- Oh, God!
- Are you okay?

506
00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:37.344
- Is this one of those, uh..
- It's a sushi bar.

507
00:42:37.617 --> 00:42:39.603
- Are you allergic?
- You could say that.

508
00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:42.755
That's a dog-faced
puffer fish over there.

509
00:42:43.353 --> 00:42:46.491
He's not even fully matured yet.
He's a teenager, for crying out loud.

510
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.134
Can I ask you
to stop that, please?

511
00:42:56.702 --> 00:42:59.742
I don't see how it could possibly
be pleasurable for a woman.

512
00:43:01.082 --> 00:43:03.257
I just don't think it's natural.

513
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.453
You're not supposed to go up there.

514
00:43:06.191 --> 00:43:08.219
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how men do it either.

515
00:43:09.112 --> 00:43:11.527
You're not curious,
just to try somethin' new?

516
00:43:12.553 --> 00:43:14.064
I'm just not into it.

517
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:18.289
So space exploration
is definitely out for you?

518
00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:21.417
Definitely. I mean, more power to any
woman who wants to be an astronaut.

519
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:22.981
I just wouldn't do it.

520
00:43:24.025 --> 00:43:25.797
Frankly, I'd rather
take it up the butt.

521
00:43:31.324 --> 00:43:32.491
So you think this is a good spot?

522
00:43:34.662 --> 00:43:35.757
It's perfect.

523
00:43:39.354 --> 00:43:42.489
Life's funny, huh?
Some pretty close calls.

524
00:43:44.881 --> 00:43:47.039
I wonder if he knew
how close he came to the end?

525
00:43:47.489 --> 00:43:48.822
Oh, he knew.

526
00:43:50.717 --> 00:43:53.865
I bet he never thought he'd
be held by such a lovely woman.

527
00:43:53.954 --> 00:43:55.831
Deuce.

528
00:43:56.119 --> 00:43:58.439
You're embarrassing me
in front of our new friend.

529
00:44:10.431 --> 00:44:12.424
That was a really nice thing
you did tonight.

530
00:44:14.603 --> 00:44:16.183
Too bad it's a freshwater fish.

531
00:44:19.391 --> 00:44:21.725
I...I'm kidding, see?
I'm just joking.

532
00:44:23.988 --> 00:44:27.688
**Take some time
For our feelings to grow**

533
00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:32.321
Good night.

534
00:44:35.981 --> 00:44:37.337
**I can't let you go**

535
00:44:40.674 --> 00:44:43.215
**And I can't let go**

536
00:44:45.888 --> 00:44:49.017
**With you I'm not shy**

537
00:44:49.239 --> 00:44:51.102
**To show the way I feel**

538
00:44:51.773 --> 00:44:53.815
**With you I might..**

539
00:44:55.712 --> 00:44:57.427
You've had yourself
an interesting little evening.

540
00:44:58.256 --> 00:45:01.150
Just takin' care of his fish, huh?
She looks like a nice catch.

541
00:45:01.531 --> 00:45:02.876
It was a first date.

542
00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:06.745
Listen up, man-whore.
I oughta bust you right now!

543
00:45:06.764 --> 00:45:10.326
- We just had sushi.
- "Sushi." Is that what
they call it nowadays?

544
00:45:10.917 --> 00:45:12.638
Well, I'm hip
to your man-whore slang.

545
00:45:13.524 --> 00:45:14.321
All right, fine.

546
00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:18.003
Why don't I just go have a little chat
with your spicy tuna roll, huh?

547
00:45:18.217 --> 00:45:19.920
No, don't!

548
00:45:21.346 --> 00:45:23.646
All right. Okay, Deuce.

549
00:45:24.474 --> 00:45:26.068
No problem, baby. Relax.

550
00:45:26.559 --> 00:45:29.027
Maybe I'll even let this one slide
for some information.

551
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:31.773
Like Antoine's black book.
You know.

552
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.278
- The one with his list of clients?
- I don't know anything about it.

553
00:45:35.424 --> 00:45:38.178
Oh, yeah?
You know anything about this?

554
00:45:39.074 --> 00:45:40.625
See that red spot over there?

555
00:45:41.159 --> 00:45:42.708
That wasn't there this morning.
I checked.

556
00:45:43.244 --> 00:45:45.539
- You know what it is?
- Maybe it's a rash.

557
00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:48.775
Something you got from jogging. How the
hell do I know? Get it away from me.

558
00:45:50.754 --> 00:45:54.100
Maybe you're right.
You got three days, Bigalow!

559
00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:06.122
T.J., I really like this girl.

560
00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:10.748
Deucey, don't be fallin' in love with
no she-John. You're in it for the money.

561
00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:14.346
Antoine will be back pretty soon.
Apartment ain't gonna pay to fix itself.

562
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.927
I know. Hey, there's been
this detective followin' me.

563
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:21.477
Goddamn it, white boy! You didn't
tell him nothin' about me, did you?

564
00:46:21.934 --> 00:46:23.158
No, but what should I do?

565
00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.050
- About what?
- About the cop!

566
00:46:28.087 --> 00:46:30.369
Will you stop mentionin'
the damn cops?

567
00:46:30.695 --> 00:46:32.773
Don't make me
he-bitch man-slap you!

568
00:46:44.356 --> 00:46:47.782
Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow,
your man-whore for this evening.

569
00:46:47.902 --> 00:46:49.353
Hi, I'm Carol..

570
00:46:53.116 --> 00:46:55.540
I have narcolepsy.
It's.. It's a sleeping disorder.

571
00:46:55.723 --> 00:46:57.313
It isn't the worst thing
you could ever have.

572
00:46:57.809 --> 00:47:00.429
I'm just not allowed to fly
an aeroplane or.. or drive a car...

573
00:47:01.196 --> 00:47:02.529
or work in a gun range.

574
00:47:04.066 --> 00:47:05.718
Yeah.

575
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.360
This is such a treat.
I've always wanted to try soup,
but there's the fear of drowning.

576
00:47:40.044 --> 00:47:42.549
- I really had fun.
- Are you gonna be okay?

577
00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.680
- I'll be fine.
- You sure?

578
00:47:45.988 --> 00:47:47.567
- Yeah.
- Good night.

579
00:48:12.846 --> 00:48:15.291
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

580
00:48:16.688 --> 00:48:19.112
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

581
00:48:19.672 --> 00:48:20.956
**Yes, it's true**

582
00:48:23.323 --> 00:48:25.181
**Yes, it's true**

583
00:48:28.519 --> 00:48:31.266
**Whenever we kiss
I get to feelin' like this**

584
00:48:31.561 --> 00:48:34.121
**I get to wishin '
that there were two of you**

585
00:48:35.315 --> 00:48:37.291
**Come on.
You can dance.**

586
00:48:37.923 --> 00:48:39.007
**Come on, baby**

587
00:48:39.919 --> 00:48:41.484
**It feels so nice**

588
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:43.137
**I want your arms to**

589
00:48:44.493 --> 00:48:47.197
**Wrap around me twice**

590
00:48:51.634 --> 00:48:54.184
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

591
00:48:55.502 --> 00:48:57.860
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

592
00:48:58.756 --> 00:48:59.659
**Right or wrong**

593
00:49:01.387 --> 00:49:03.341
**Baby, right or wrong**

594
00:49:10.772 --> 00:49:14.726
**I can't get enough of you, baby**
- Ohh, Deuce.

595
00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:17.409
- You look great.
- Thanks.

596
00:49:18.073 --> 00:49:21.532
- I want you to meet my roommate.
- Who's there? Kate?

597
00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:24.499
- I hear someone.
- It's just me and my friend.

598
00:49:25.164 --> 00:49:27.337
Are you sure?
I hear three people.

599
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.181
You're the third person.

600
00:49:29.752 --> 00:49:31.523
Oh. Oh, okay.

601
00:49:31.838 --> 00:49:34.114
She's newly blind.
She's still getting adjusted.

602
00:49:35.175 --> 00:49:37.775
Bergita, this is Deuce.

603
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:40.503
I think there's
something wrong with Cassie.

604
00:49:41.015 --> 00:49:42.216
Oh, honey.

605
00:49:43.518 --> 00:49:45.293
This isn't Cassie.

606
00:49:46.229 --> 00:49:47.639
Here she is.

607
00:49:48.732 --> 00:49:51.483
Oh, there you are.

608
00:49:51.965 --> 00:49:53.996
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

609
00:49:56.658 --> 00:49:59.619
Once you try it for the first time,
you're pretty happy with the results.

610
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:03.700
I've never met
a hair transplant technician before.

611
00:50:11.386 --> 00:50:14.890
Oh, man! I forgot.
It's my dad's birthday.

612
00:50:15.429 --> 00:50:17.232
- Let's go see him.
- He's working.

613
00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:19.192
So, what does he do?

614
00:50:20.956 --> 00:50:23.476
He's in the restaurant industry.

615
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:30.238
Kate, I'd like you
to meet my dad, Bob Bigalow.

616
00:50:30.626 --> 00:50:31.884
Bob, Kate.

617
00:50:33.157 --> 00:50:36.328
- Hi.
- Son, I'm very proud of you.

618
00:50:36.808 --> 00:50:39.234
She is a lovely young lady.

619
00:50:40.248 --> 00:50:41.292
Thank you.

620
00:50:42.335 --> 00:50:45.359
It's so nice to meet you.
Happy birthday.

621
00:50:45.682 --> 00:50:47.857
- Thank you.
- Well, we should probably be going.

622
00:50:48.279 --> 00:50:49.487
Deuce.

623
00:50:50.886 --> 00:50:53.439
Dad probably has a lot
of paperwork to do and..

624
00:50:53.702 --> 00:50:55.706
No, the paper's
completely stocked.

625
00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.931
I've got plenty of time to get
more acquainted with the woman...

626
00:50:59.125 --> 00:51:01.118
who's made my boy so happy.

627
00:51:01.627 --> 00:51:05.120
We got you a cake.
Deuce said it's your favourite.

628
00:51:05.695 --> 00:51:07.897
We had to go to
a Filipino bakery to get it.

629
00:51:08.405 --> 00:51:09.594
You didn't.

630
00:51:10.492 --> 00:51:14.455
You did!
Raspberry bibingka?

631
00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:16.336
Aw, you shouldn't have.

632
00:51:16.645 --> 00:51:19.251
My wife,
God rest her soul...

633
00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:21.104
used to make this all the time.

634
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:22.797
You would have liked her.

635
00:51:23.736 --> 00:51:25.561
Bangkok Betty.

636
00:51:26.552 --> 00:51:30.984
She had the most amazing mouth.
It paid for our honeymoon.

637
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.803
- Well, we should probably be going.
- Deuce, it's your dad's birthday.

638
00:51:40.421 --> 00:51:44.280
Hi, Bob. We have an overflowing toilet
in the ladies' bathroom.

639
00:51:44.708 --> 00:51:45.948
There is shit everywhere.

640
00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:48.452
It's a real mess. You think you can get
in there and take care of that for me?

641
00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:50.586
No worries, Vic.
Right on it.

642
00:51:51.267 --> 00:51:53.102
I'd like you to meet
my son's girlfriend Kate.

643
00:51:53.457 --> 00:51:55.809
- Kate, nice to meet you.
- You too.
- Hi, Deuce.

644
00:51:56.273 --> 00:51:57.252
So, could you get in there, Bob?

645
00:51:57.628 --> 00:52:02.430
I mean, I got a party of ten coming in,
and I am up to my ankles in human crap.

646
00:52:02.843 --> 00:52:04.346
It's a real stink-fest back there.

647
00:52:04.929 --> 00:52:05.748
Sure.

648
00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:09.178
Well, looks like
I better get back to work.

649
00:52:10.142 --> 00:52:11.780
It's a pleasure
meeting you, dear.

650
00:52:12.541 --> 00:52:14.855
It warms my heart
just being in your presence.

651
00:52:15.357 --> 00:52:16.690
Oh, thank you.

652
00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:19.134
See you, son.

653
00:52:23.491 --> 00:52:25.493
See, my dad's
one of those guys, uh..

654
00:52:25.785 --> 00:52:27.845
- He likes to be involved
in every facet of the business.
- It's okay.

655
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.374
There.. There's no, uh, problem
too small or too big.

656
00:52:30.505 --> 00:52:33.453
- I mean, they come to him
for everything.
- Deuce, it's all right.

657
00:52:36.214 --> 00:52:37.608
It's not his restaurant.

658
00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:41.258
My dad's not even a waiter.

659
00:52:42.471 --> 00:52:45.680
He's the men's room attendant.
I'm sorry.

660
00:52:46.642 --> 00:52:48.244
Don't be silly.

661
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.155
You know what my dad does?

662
00:52:52.065 --> 00:52:54.163
He's an aeronautical engineer.

663
00:53:05.935 --> 00:53:07.603
Bob?

664
00:53:12.714 --> 00:53:14.380
Wanna blow out your candle?

665
00:53:26.271 --> 00:53:28.872
Mmm, now that's good bibingka.

666
00:53:37.742 --> 00:53:39.143
I had a really nice time tonight.

667
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.219
I find that hard to believe.

668
00:53:46.294 --> 00:53:48.116
I've never met anyone like you.

669
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:50.609
Good.

670
00:53:52.342 --> 00:53:54.000
I have to see you again.

671
00:53:56.826 --> 00:54:00.451
When we go inside, try to be quiet
so we don't wake up Bergita.

672
00:54:05.065 --> 00:54:06.525
**With you I'm not shy**

673
00:54:06.794 --> 00:54:09.279
**To show the way I feel**

674
00:54:10.071 --> 00:54:13.199
**With you I might try**

675
00:54:13.611 --> 00:54:15.581
**My secrets to reveal**

676
00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:19.462
**For you are a magnet**

677
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.627
**And I am steel**

678
00:54:24.087 --> 00:54:25.714
Why don't I get the light?

679
00:54:27.799 --> 00:54:30.508
Hang on. I'll be right back.
Be right back.

680
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:41.995
You are good.

681
00:54:52.827 --> 00:54:53.954
- Hi.
- Hi.

682
00:54:57.416 --> 00:54:59.068
Are you all right?

683
00:55:00.336 --> 00:55:02.632
I need you
to be okay with something.

684
00:55:03.256 --> 00:55:05.299
What? I'm okay with everything.

685
00:55:05.863 --> 00:55:07.010
Deuce.

686
00:55:07.427 --> 00:55:10.236
There may be things about me
that you don't like.

687
00:55:11.182 --> 00:55:12.838
I like everything about you.

688
00:55:13.684 --> 00:55:16.399
I mean, physically.

689
00:55:17.439 --> 00:55:20.984
So you're taller than me.
Big deal. I'll get over it.

690
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:22.511
It's not that.

691
00:55:23.592 --> 00:55:24.602
What?

692
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:31.413
If you were to find out something
about me and my body that was...

693
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.618
maybe a little different than what you
were used to, would that be okay?

694
00:55:35.793 --> 00:55:39.130
There could be nothing on your body
that I wouldn't like.

695
00:55:39.964 --> 00:55:41.417
What are you talkin' about?

696
00:55:43.509 --> 00:55:46.718
What, you got, like, six toes
or something? I can live with that.

697
00:55:48.098 --> 00:55:52.329
- Deuce, I have to tell you. I have a..
- Shh.

698
00:56:23.764 --> 00:56:27.284
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

699
00:56:27.726 --> 00:56:30.543
- I tried to tell you!
- No, it's my fault.

700
00:56:30.893 --> 00:56:33.036
I shouldn't have
pulled it so hard.

701
00:56:33.566 --> 00:56:35.548
If you wanna leave,
I completely understand.

702
00:56:35.907 --> 00:56:38.676
I don't wanna leave.
I'm sorry I had that reaction.

703
00:56:38.944 --> 00:56:40.867
I just.. I got a lot of things
going on in my life recently...

704
00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:43.119
and they all sort of culminated
when your leg fell off..

705
00:56:43.578 --> 00:56:45.456
came off.. disconnected.. I..

706
00:56:45.627 --> 00:56:48.375
-Just get out.
- Oh, my God!

707
00:56:48.587 --> 00:56:49.373
Please, leave!

708
00:56:56.927 --> 00:56:58.288
Just go home.

709
00:56:58.804 --> 00:57:00.298
Don't I have a say in this?

710
00:57:00.993 --> 00:57:04.056
- Hand me my leg.
- Then will you come out and talk?

711
00:57:04.435 --> 00:57:05.696
I don't know.

712
00:57:14.447 --> 00:57:15.770
Are you sure you want to stay?

713
00:57:16.741 --> 00:57:19.675
Yes, but only
If you come out of there.

714
00:57:21.642 --> 00:57:24.208
I need to know how you feel
about all this.

715
00:57:25.605 --> 00:57:27.576
The same as I did an hour ago...

716
00:57:28.942 --> 00:57:32.106
when I thought to myself,
"I'm the luckiest guy in the world...

717
00:57:32.279 --> 00:57:33.426
to be with her leg.."

718
00:57:33.604 --> 00:57:34.907
with you.

719
00:58:02.626 --> 00:58:05.310
Ow.

720
00:58:06.172 --> 00:58:08.883
Is this normal?
My face is numb.

721
00:58:08.943 --> 00:58:11.964
It's perfectly normal
in hair replacement surgery.

722
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.349
The local anaesthetic has numbed
the major nerves in your face...

723
00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.331
just like at the dentist.

724
00:58:17.748 --> 00:58:20.561
Ow!

725
00:58:21.189 --> 00:58:23.233
You're Kate's best friends, and...

726
00:58:23.483 --> 00:58:26.778
I know your opinions
mean a lot to her, and...

727
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:28.747
I'd like to get
really serious with her.

728
00:58:29.532 --> 00:58:32.219
- You're a prostitute!
- Not any more.

729
00:58:32.661 --> 00:58:36.202
And it's "man-whore."
Anyway, I just quit.

730
00:58:36.414 --> 00:58:38.274
- I mean, Kate's the one for me.
- Listen.

731
00:58:38.709 --> 00:58:40.511
You were only supposed to go
out with her one night...

732
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:42.847
show her a good time, and then
get the hell out of her life.

733
00:58:42.984 --> 00:58:45.592
- You know she's not normal.
- She's not like other girls.

734
00:58:46.049 --> 00:58:48.784
You know what her problem is?
Friends like you.

735
00:58:49.138 --> 00:58:51.299
She's perfect. She's kind.

736
00:58:51.432 --> 00:58:54.650
She's sweet, she's funny,
and she likes me.

737
00:58:54.978 --> 00:58:57.289
Now, I came here
to give you your money back...

738
00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.339
the money you paid a stranger
to have sex with your friend.

739
00:59:03.216 --> 00:59:06.043
Hey! You stay away
from her, man-whore!

740
00:59:07.179 --> 00:59:10.288
Hi ya, Deuce. Your three days
are up, lover boy.

741
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.223
So where's Antoine's black book?

742
00:59:12.498 --> 00:59:14.397
- I've looked everywhere.
- Listen, punk.

743
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:16.930
You are aiding and abetting
a known criminal.

744
00:59:17.191 --> 00:59:19.513
Do the initials T and J
mean anything to you?

745
00:59:20.006 --> 00:59:21.866
Uh, turkey jizz?
I don't..

746
00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.073
You better show some respect,
or I'm gonna rip that little...

747
00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:26.490
pleasure-giving tongue of yours
right out of your head!

748
00:59:26.888 --> 00:59:27.985
One more thing.

749
00:59:28.401 --> 00:59:30.765
I was at the precinct,
and I really had to use the john...

750
00:59:31.373 --> 00:59:33.455
and it's pretty filthy in there,
and I was in kind of a hurry.

751
00:59:33.876 --> 00:59:36.663
I didn't have enough time to use one
Of those, you know, paper ass gaskets.

752
00:59:37.108 --> 00:59:38.568
Anyway, I was doin' my business,
and, uh...

753
00:59:38.777 --> 00:59:40.662
something splashed up on me,
you know, all over?

754
00:59:40.967 --> 00:59:44.083
What do you do in situations like that?
You think I'll be all right?

755
00:59:45.035 --> 00:59:47.954
- I think you're pretty safe.
- I better be.

756
00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.230
Ugly is not a problem
for this guy.

757
00:59:56.506 --> 00:59:58.559
My man would stick his dick
in a he-monkey.

758
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.070
All right, holler at you later.

759
01:00:02.763 --> 01:00:03.740
What up, Deucey?

760
01:00:05.891 --> 01:00:07.871
You should know that cop
won't leave me alone.

761
01:00:09.854 --> 01:00:12.595
- What about the cop?
- He's been asking questions.

762
01:00:12.878 --> 01:00:13.903
Goddamn, white boy.

763
01:00:14.339 --> 01:00:16.016
Anyway, it doesn't matter
to me any more.

764
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.883
- I'm quitting.
- What about Antoine's apartment?

765
01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.009
I'm gonna get the rest of the money
the old-fashioned way.

766
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:22.970
You gonna steal it?

767
01:00:26.018 --> 01:00:27.448
See ya, T.J.

768
01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:38.292
Uh, see, I just quit.
I'm never doing it again.

769
01:00:39.158 --> 01:00:41.581
- You lied to me!
- Listen, please.

770
01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:45.021
- It's not what you think.
- You were paid to go out with me!

771
01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.499
- You want breakfast?
- Kate!

772
01:00:54.175 --> 01:00:55.760
Just go away!

773
01:00:56.782 --> 01:00:59.762
- I never want to see you again!
- Me neither.

774
01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:04.133
I'm sorry.

775
01:01:14.302 --> 01:01:16.763
**I feel sad when you're sad**

776
01:01:17.848 --> 01:01:20.335
**I feel glad when you're glad**

777
01:01:20.664 --> 01:01:23.928
**And if you only knew
what I'm goin' through**

778
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:30.252
**I just can't smile
Without you**

779
01:01:35.576 --> 01:01:38.705
**You came along
just like a song**

780
01:01:39.045 --> 01:01:41.142
**And brightened my day**

781
01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:44.441
**Who'd have believed
you were part of a dream**

782
01:01:44.563 --> 01:01:47.994
**And now it all seems
light years away**

783
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.730
**And you know
I can't smile without you**

784
01:01:54.974 --> 01:01:57.268
**I can't smile without you**

785
01:01:57.536 --> 01:02:01.161
**And I can't laugh
I can't sing**

786
01:02:01.648 --> 01:02:05.007
**I'm findin' it hard
to do anything**

787
01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.407
I'm 1500 short. Isn't there
anything else you can do?

788
01:02:10.616 --> 01:02:13.773
Listen, I came all over the place..
down from six grand.

789
01:02:14.162 --> 01:02:16.686
This is a custom hand job.

790
01:02:16.874 --> 01:02:17.880
Let me pay you monthly.

791
01:02:18.281 --> 01:02:21.457
The last time I didn't get the money
up front, I got the big stiffie.

792
01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:25.320
Hello?

793
01:02:25.946 --> 01:02:27.511
What the hell are you doing
picking up my phone?

794
01:02:27.561 --> 01:02:28.608
I found the coral you wanted.

795
01:02:29.243 --> 01:02:32.165
If you're doing anything I disapprove of
in my apartment, I will kill you.

796
01:02:33.037 --> 01:02:34.913
Rip your veins out one by one!

797
01:02:36.374 --> 01:02:38.262
Murder! I will kill you!

798
01:02:43.361 --> 01:02:47.622
Hey, Antoine, it's Elaine.
I really need to see you again.

799
01:02:48.576 --> 01:02:50.226
Same price, same place?

800
01:02:52.539 --> 01:02:53.310
I'll have the money.

801
01:02:55.145 --> 01:03:00.578
Hi. Um, this isn't Antoine but
maybe we can work something out.

802
01:03:07.139 --> 01:04:10.026
Hi.

803
01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:23.556
I'm Deuce.

804
01:03:42.596 --> 01:03:44.319
- Stop.
- Why?

805
01:03:45.515 --> 01:03:47.673
- You don't wanna have sex.
- Yes, I do.

806
01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:50.591
I think we both do.

807
01:03:54.276 --> 01:03:55.574
Don't you find me attractive?

808
01:03:56.778 --> 01:04:00.337
Are you kidding? You're one
Of the hottest women I've ever seen.

809
01:04:01.158 --> 01:04:02.338
Easy, easy.

810
01:04:03.453 --> 01:04:04.810
I just can't do this.

811
01:04:06.372 --> 01:04:08.227
I'm head over heels
for a girl, and...

812
01:04:08.563 --> 01:04:10.815
we're goin' through a rough time,
me bein' a man-whore and all...

813
01:04:11.378 --> 01:04:14.036
but I know it's gonna work out,
because I love her.

814
01:04:16.176 --> 01:04:17.551
She's a lucky girl.

815
01:04:19.616 --> 01:04:21.382
At least emotionally.

816
01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:25.573
- My guy used to be like that.
- Hey.

817
01:04:27.438 --> 01:04:28.894
Hang in there.

818
01:04:31.506 --> 01:04:33.356
Things have a way of working out.

819
01:04:39.118 --> 01:04:41.262
Hey, where you goin'?

820
01:04:44.124 --> 01:04:46.749
Well, I thought we talked
and you understood.

821
01:04:47.138 --> 01:04:50.587
I understand, but the fact is
I still paid for your services.

822
01:04:52.049 --> 01:04:53.071
Then what do you have in mind?

823
01:05:03.729 --> 01:05:07.055
**Baby, let's get together**

824
01:05:08.214 --> 01:05:10.860
**Honey, hon, me and you**

825
01:05:12.177 --> 01:05:13.993
**And do the things
Ah**

826
01:05:14.575 --> 01:05:15.967
**Do the things**

827
01:05:17.391 --> 01:05:19.281
**That we like to do**

828
01:05:20.415 --> 01:05:22.022
**Oh, do a little dance**

829
01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:25.922
**Make a little love
Get down tonight**

830
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:27.995
**Get down tonight**

831
01:05:29.696 --> 01:05:32.776
**Do a little dance
Make a little love**

832
01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:34.564
**Get down tonight**

833
01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:37.445
**Get down tonight, baby**

834
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.375
**Oh, get down, get down**

835
01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:40.455
**Get down, get down**

836
01:05:40.959 --> 01:05:43.566
**Get down tonight, baby**

837
01:05:43.848 --> 01:05:46.174
**Woo, woo, woo, woo
woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo**

838
01:05:46.713 --> 01:05:49.598
**Get down, get down,
get down, get down**

839
01:06:09.637 --> 01:06:11.424
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, God, you were amazing.

840
01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:13.000
Are you kidding?

841
01:06:17.981 --> 01:06:19.502
I just had to see for myself.

842
01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:30.480
Kate!

843
01:06:31.016 --> 01:06:32.357
**I'm not in love**

844
01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:37.074
**I'm not in love**

845
01:06:50.517 --> 01:06:51.542
- What?
- How's Elaine?

846
01:06:53.437 --> 01:06:54.969
You know, your wife.

847
01:06:57.609 --> 01:06:58.652
- Bastard!
- Oh!

848
01:06:58.684 --> 01:07:00.343
This wasn't about some black book.

849
01:07:00.737 --> 01:07:02.939
Your wife was a customer
of Antoine's, wasn't she?

850
01:07:03.449 --> 01:07:06.423
That son of a bitch is goin' down,
and you're gonna join him!

851
01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.738
How's that gonna fix your marriage?

852
01:07:15.859 --> 01:07:17.481
Look, I lost someone
that I love too.

853
01:07:20.135 --> 01:07:21.848
You know why she did this?

854
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:25.407
You wanna know why
she went outside our marriage?

855
01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.386
It's because of my dick, man!

856
01:07:28.894 --> 01:07:31.077
I mean, that's the reason.
It's my dick!

857
01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:32.938
Look, take it easy.

858
01:07:34.108 --> 01:07:37.237
You're saying your wife cheated on you
because your penis is too small?

859
01:07:37.507 --> 01:07:40.453
It's not too small!
It's too thin! Okay?

860
01:07:40.782 --> 01:07:42.044
My dick is too thin!

861
01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.738
I got a thin dick!

862
01:07:44.746 --> 01:07:47.875
Okay, can you keep it down?
I'd like to come back here someday.

863
01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:52.045
Everybody knows that it's width,
width that gives sexual gratification.

864
01:07:52.308 --> 01:07:54.844
I've read it.
Cosmo, Redbook, you name it.

865
01:07:55.278 --> 01:07:58.571
What am I supposed to do?
I got the thinnest penis in the world.

866
01:07:59.137 --> 01:08:00.597
Here.
It's like a Twizzler.

867
01:08:00.738 --> 01:08:02.736
- Look!
- No, no! Stop that!

868
01:08:03.099 --> 01:08:05.561
Look, sit down! Sit!

869
01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:09.189
It's not your dick!
It's you!

870
01:08:09.983 --> 01:08:12.694
I'm tellin' you now, if you painted it
silver and twisted it on the end...

871
01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:14.066
it'd look like a kickstand.

872
01:08:15.823 --> 01:08:17.682
If man-whoring
has taught me anything...

873
01:08:18.117 --> 01:08:20.768
it's that most women are
as unhappy with their entire body...

874
01:08:21.246 --> 01:08:22.897
as you are
with your small penis.

875
01:08:23.123 --> 01:08:24.870
- Thin penis.
- Well, whatever.

876
01:08:26.459 --> 01:08:28.024
While you're worried
about your penis...

877
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.200
Thin penis.

878
01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:31.685
women are worried about their height...

879
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.667
their weight,
their giant feet...

880
01:08:35.219 --> 01:08:35.949
the stream of obscenities...

881
01:08:36.244 --> 01:08:37.961
that could burst through their mouth
at any second.

882
01:08:38.766 --> 01:08:40.789
If you make a woman
feel good about herself...

883
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:43.766
it really doesn't matter
what's wrong with you.

884
01:08:46.587 --> 01:08:48.085
Even if it's really, really thin?

885
01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:50.550
We're talkin' spaghetti stick.

886
01:08:53.469 --> 01:08:54.517
Tell you what.

887
01:08:55.243 --> 01:08:58.627
Every time you're feeling
self-conscious about your thin dick...

888
01:08:58.892 --> 01:09:02.360
say something nice
to make your woman feel sexy.

889
01:09:03.794 --> 01:09:07.301
I mean, is that it?
Is that all there is?

890
01:09:09.842 --> 01:09:11.165
There is one other thing.

891
01:09:12.762 --> 01:09:14.155
**Do a little dance**

892
01:09:15.056 --> 01:09:16.167
**Make a little love**

893
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:17.875
**Get down tonight**

894
01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:20.063
**Get down tonight**

895
01:09:21.313 --> 01:09:22.711
**Do a little dance**

896
01:09:23.608 --> 01:09:24.829
**Make a little love**

897
01:09:25.381 --> 01:09:26.400
**Get down tonight**

898
01:09:27.257 --> 01:09:28.524
**Get down tonight**

899
01:09:28.927 --> 01:09:29.716
Uh, yes, sir.

900
01:09:31.429 --> 01:09:34.857
Um, you're sure there isn't
anything you can do?

901
01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:38.794
Yes, sir. I understand.

902
01:09:46.759 --> 01:09:50.731
Listen. I really appreciate
you helping me.

903
01:09:51.869 --> 01:09:53.013
I guess I misjudged you.

904
01:09:55.102 --> 01:09:56.478
Anyway, I got you off the hook.

905
01:09:58.022 --> 01:10:01.005
- Why am I still worried?
- You gotta give 'em T.J.

906
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:03.052
I can't do that.

907
01:10:03.445 --> 01:10:05.877
You got no choice. I been workin' on this case for three months.

908
01:10:06.677 --> 01:10:10.040
-Boss says somebody's gotta be arrested.
-But T.J.'s my friend.

909
01:10:10.536 --> 01:10:11.683
They're serious, Deuce.

910
01:10:13.561 --> 01:10:16.506
Look, I don't like it,
but it's either you or him.

911
01:10:20.443 --> 01:10:21.193
Your Honour...

912
01:10:22.007 --> 01:10:25.619
sex for money
is morally reprehensible.

913
01:10:26.179 --> 01:10:30.816
Mr. Bigalow has compounded this crime
by refusing to name his he-pimp.

914
01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:34.147
Therefore we ask
for the maximum term for each...

915
01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:36.881
of the five counts
of prostitution.

916
01:11:00.287 --> 01:11:02.053
Excuse me.

917
01:11:16.132 --> 01:11:17.800
We never had sex.

918
01:11:18.843 --> 01:11:20.123
We talked about it.

919
01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.513
Well, I talked about it.

920
01:11:23.536 --> 01:11:25.681
But Deuce
never took advantage of me.

921
01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.300
He should have,
but he's my friend.

922
01:11:31.148 --> 01:11:32.931
He made me realize
that I wasn't just some...

923
01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:35.684
hot babe with huge tits...

924
01:11:36.467 --> 01:11:38.057
even though I am.

925
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:41.961
Oh, and he also
got me walkin' again.

926
01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:50.486
Deuce and I never had sex.

927
01:11:51.067 --> 01:11:53.978
- It was physically impossible.
- Freak!

928
01:11:55.656 --> 01:11:57.505
It's true I paid him money
to be with him...

929
01:11:58.054 --> 01:12:01.619
and I'd do it again, because he
made me feel good about myself.

930
01:12:02.225 --> 01:12:03.975
Behemoth.

931
01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.781
And no one
ever touched my feet before.

932
01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:10.698
That's a huge bitch!

933
01:12:13.071 --> 01:12:15.181
Deuce taught me to be comfortable
with who I am.

934
01:12:16.513 --> 01:12:18.262
Thank you, Deuce.

935
01:12:18.598 --> 01:12:19.734
You asshole!

936
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.188
These are very serious charges,
Mr. Bigalow.

937
01:12:26.524 --> 01:12:28.248
I just have one question to ask you.

938
01:12:28.714 --> 01:12:30.591
During your entire stint
as a he-whore...

939
01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:31.881
did you have sex with anyone?

940
01:12:35.075 --> 01:12:35.938
Yes, Your Honour.

941
01:12:38.829 --> 01:12:39.585
Just one woman.

942
01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:45.085
- And I'm in love with her.
- Order.

943
01:12:46.964 --> 01:12:47.820
Order, please.

944
01:12:49.153 --> 01:12:50.976
This is very important,
Mr. Bigalow.

945
01:12:51.657 --> 01:12:53.725
Did she pay you for sex?

946
01:12:56.836 --> 01:12:57.610
No.

947
01:12:59.686 --> 01:13:00.787
Case dismissed.

948
01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.372
Yes!

949
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.790
These shots will deaden
the nerve area...

950
01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:23.261
where your hair transplants will be.

951
01:13:25.549 --> 01:13:27.205
There. That should do it.

952
01:13:27.739 --> 01:13:30.303
Nurse, would you please remove
our donor hair?

953
01:13:31.285 --> 01:13:32.403
I'll be back in a minute.

954
01:13:45.363 --> 01:13:47.930
Mr. Johnson, please just lie
back down now.

955
01:13:48.701 --> 01:13:50.148
Oh, my God! Deuce!

956
01:13:51.203 --> 01:13:54.172
- Kate, listen to me.
- What are you doing here?

957
01:13:55.896 --> 01:13:58.051
It's the only way
I could get you to see me.

958
01:13:58.921 --> 01:14:00.825
Deuce, it's over between us.

959
01:14:04.448 --> 01:14:05.409
Listen.

960
01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.096
Those shots hurt like hell.
Could you at least hear me out?

961
01:14:10.496 --> 01:14:12.269
Well, I don't know how much
you charge by the hour...

962
01:14:12.438 --> 01:14:13.457
but you have one minute.

963
01:14:14.355 --> 01:14:17.250
Okay. I deserved that.

964
01:14:19.735 --> 01:14:21.985
I should have told you
right from the start...

965
01:14:23.323 --> 01:14:24.384
but I was afraid.

966
01:14:25.722 --> 01:14:26.950
Afraid of what?

967
01:14:27.599 --> 01:14:29.970
Afraid that a girl
as wonderful as you...

968
01:14:30.779 --> 01:14:33.717
could never fall for a guy
who cleans fish tanks.

969
01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.779
'Cause that's who I really am.

970
01:14:38.028 --> 01:14:40.321
This whole gigolo thing
was just a mistake...

971
01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:43.404
but I'm glad it happened.

972
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:46.681
'Cause I never would have met you.

973
01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:50.309
I never would have known
what love was.

974
01:14:52.106 --> 01:14:52.988
I'm sorry.

975
01:14:53.671 --> 01:14:54.487
I'm not perfect.

976
01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.117
I'm not perfect either.

977
01:15:03.577 --> 01:15:04.523
Yes, you are.

978
01:15:05.872 --> 01:15:07.833
You're perfect in every way.

979
01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.968
I knew it the moment I met you.

980
01:15:17.604 --> 01:15:18.437
Kate...

981
01:15:20.575 --> 01:15:23.477
"You have a smile
that could melt an iceberg.

982
01:15:24.538 --> 01:15:27.908
Your lips are as sweet as honey.

983
01:15:29.165 --> 01:15:30.878
You may only have one leg...

984
01:15:32.151 --> 01:15:35.310
but it's the most beautiful leg
in the world."

985
01:15:42.684 --> 01:15:45.420
Are you kissing me?
'Cause I can't feel a thing.

986
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:49.432
...now boarding at gate 53.

987
01:15:49.828 --> 01:15:52.832
Flight 14 to Sydney, Australia,
is now boarding at gate..

988
01:15:53.634 --> 01:15:54.981
I've never done this
in 12 hours before...

989
01:15:55.512 --> 01:15:57.635
and I'm not responsible
if the seals leak, Deuce.

990
01:15:59.891 --> 01:16:02.127
Shit! Shit cabinet!

991
01:16:11.883 --> 01:16:13.680
Come on, Deucey.
Put the fish in the tank already.

992
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:15.595
Antoine's plane
landed 20 minutes ago.

993
01:16:17.619 --> 01:16:19.110
I think we're gonna be okay.

994
01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:24.139
Could you step
this way, please?

995
01:16:27.005 --> 01:16:28.456
Is it time to put
the big guy in yet?

996
01:16:30.968 --> 01:16:32.493
Give him another minute.
Temperature's not right.

997
01:16:42.335 --> 01:16:44.751
Spread them again, please.

998
01:16:48.384 --> 01:16:49.695
Okay, we can put
the last fish in.

999
01:16:50.469 --> 01:16:53.550
- Looks like we pulled it off, kid.
- Time for some tequila!

1000
01:17:01.002 --> 01:17:02.375
Margaritas, anybody?

1001
01:17:23.319 --> 01:17:24.362
I need...

1002
01:17:24.643 --> 01:17:27.290
Chinese tail bar lionfish.

1003
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:32.372
- Seven hundred, eight hundred.
- Where'd you get all that money?

1004
01:17:32.705 --> 01:17:36.696
- Friends.
- Yeah, right. Anything else?

1005
01:17:38.441 --> 01:17:40.200
On second thought, you'd better
give me some of those sea snails.

1006
01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:12.379
So, uh, how was your trip?

1007
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:15.504
Very good...

1008
01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:17.720
till about three hours ago.

1009
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:20.364
Yeah? What happened?

1010
01:18:21.302 --> 01:18:22.255
I don't want to talk about it.

1011
01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:27.214
The place looks good.

1012
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:31.521
Good to be home.

1013
01:18:31.834 --> 01:18:33.233
Well, I should take off
so you can relax.

1014
01:18:33.712 --> 01:18:34.977
There's something
you're not telling me?

1015
01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:42.991
Yeah. I put your mail
on the nightstand.

1016
01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:49.391
Right.

1017
01:18:53.943 --> 01:18:54.813
What the hell is this?

1018
01:18:55.612 --> 01:18:56.875
A chocolate margarita.

1019
01:18:57.801 --> 01:19:00.428
- You've been having a party?
- It was, uh, more like, uh...

1020
01:19:01.452 --> 01:19:03.026
a "welcome home" thing, really.

1021
01:19:05.831 --> 01:19:07.649
I guess I could really
use one right now.

1022
01:19:18.346 --> 01:19:19.430
Spicy.

1023
01:19:22.621 --> 01:19:24.367
- I should probably go.
- My fish.

1024
01:19:27.939 --> 01:19:29.504
They look smaller.

1025
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.837
Sometimes
when they're, uh, sick...

1026
01:19:35.344 --> 01:19:36.516
they'll shrink.

1027
01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.849
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

1028
01:19:41.236 --> 01:19:44.144
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy,
fishy, fishy, fishy.

1029
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:46.734
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

1030
01:20:07.568 --> 01:20:11.331
I did man-whore for a little bit,
but none of your clients.

1031
01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:12.871
None of them.

1032
01:20:13.304 --> 01:20:15.748
I know an aquarium guy
who can fix all of this.

1033
01:20:16.224 --> 01:20:18.506
- He's a little expensive..
- Ha!

1034
01:20:18.622 --> 01:20:19.911
Deuce!

1035
01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:27.799
No!

1036
01:20:52.985 --> 01:20:54.621
- Deuce!
- No!

1037
01:21:18.482 --> 01:21:21.625
Hey! Tough guy.
What do you think of this?

1038
01:21:23.175 --> 01:21:24.739
You're busted.

1039
01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:27.562
What's goin' on out here?

1040
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.112
I can see!

1041
01:21:34.542 --> 01:21:37.428
You're black.
I knew it.
