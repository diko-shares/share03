00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.566
<i>Who am I? You sure you want to know?</i>

2
00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.886
<i>The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.</i>

3
00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.563
<i>If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...</i>

4
00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.047
<i>...if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

5
00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.927
<i>...somebody lied.</i>

6
00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.205
<i>But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...</i>

7
00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:21.722
<i>...is all about a girl.</i>

8
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.847
<i>That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.</i>

9
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.967
<i>The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.</i>

10
00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.689
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.</i>

11
00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.760
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

12
00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.518
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.604
<i>That's me .</i>

14
00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.606
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:43.958
Stop!

16
00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.285
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.407
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.

18
00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.763
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.722
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:04.157
What a geek!

21
00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.848
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.522
Would you date him?

23
00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.805
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.518
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

25
00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:37.119
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:40.606
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:42.925
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:46.001
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:47.767
Come on, stay together.

30
00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:50.727
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.761
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

32
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.363
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

33
00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:02.724
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?

34
00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:04.647
The entrance is right there.

35
00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.358
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.

36
00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.799
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

37
00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.642
...because you flunked out
of private school?

38
00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.841
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

39
00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:21.641
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

40
00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.077
It's just...

41
00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:24.648
Just what, Harry?

42
00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.282
Forget it.

43
00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.443
Pete!

44
00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.238
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

45
00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:36.205
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.

46
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.917
- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

47
00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.439
- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

48
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.408
I'm something of a scientist myself.

49
00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.606
I read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.

50
00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:53.681
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

51
00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.040
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

52
00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.566
- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

53
00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.244
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

54
00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:10.845
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

55
00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.886
I think he wants to adopt you.

56
00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:13.649
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

57
00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:17.562
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

58
00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:21.398
<i>They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.</i>

59
00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:22.644
That's amazing!

60
00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:26.563
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.

61
00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.845
It's unreal.

62
00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.682
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

63
00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.245
...varying strengths
to help them search for food.

64
00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.488
<i>For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...</i>

65
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.642
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

66
00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:45.481
For the school paper?

67
00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:54.599
<i>Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...</i>

68
00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:56.606
<i>...genus Kukulcania.</i>

69
00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.001
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

70
00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:06.237
...proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in bridges.

71
00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.281
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

72
00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.327
Or his father will fire your father.

73
00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.959
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

74
00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:16.518
What is going on?

75
00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.647
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

76
00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:21.760
- This spider...
- Let's go.

77
00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:25.922
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

78
00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.485
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

79
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.719
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.

80
00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.601
A spider-sense.

81
00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:35.801
Hey, look at that spider.

82
00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:40.201
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

83
00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.280
It's a defense mechanism.

84
00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:45.600
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

85
00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:46.918
Who wouldn't?

86
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:50.764
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...

87
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:55.127
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

88
00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:59.880
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

89
00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:03.604
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

90
00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:05.128
I love them!

91
00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:07.241
Yeah, me too.

92
00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.878
You know, spiders can change
their color...

93
00:08:12.049 --> 00:08:15.724
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

94
00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:19.848
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

95
00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:23.280
- transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

96
00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:26.441
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

97
00:08:26.609 --> 00:08:31.080
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

98
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:32.682
There's 14.

99
00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:34.448
I beg your pardon?

100
00:08:34.609 --> 00:08:37.043
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

101
00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:42.363
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

102
00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:47.365
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?

103
00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:51.442
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

104
00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:53.281
Let's talk about listening.

105
00:08:57.209 --> 00:08:59.849
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

106
00:08:59.849 --> 00:09:01.123
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

107
00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:03.126
...but at Midtown High...

108
00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:14.844
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

109
00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:16.408
- Sure.
- Great.

110
00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:18.804
Where do you want me?
Over here?

111
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:20.283
Yeah, that's great.

112
00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:22.281
Don't make me look ugly.

113
00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:24.401
That's impossible.

114
00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:32.563
Perfect.

115
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:41.488
- Is that good?
- Great.

116
00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:48.128
That's great.

117
00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:55.400
M.J., let's go!

118
00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:59.357
Wait. Thanks!

119
00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:14.928
Parker, let's do it.

120
00:10:30.969 --> 00:10:34.279
We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.

121
00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:36.883
I've already seen the glider.

122
00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:39.245
That's not what I'm here for.

123
00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:42.009
General Slocum, good to see you again.

124
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.879
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

125
00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:46.881
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

126
00:10:47.049 --> 00:10:50.439
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

127
00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:53.925
I want the report on human
performance enhancers.

128
00:10:54.089 --> 00:10:58.401
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

129
00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:00.366
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

130
00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:01.564
Once.

131
00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:04.289
All the tests since
have been successful.

132
00:11:04.449 --> 00:11:08.044
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

133
00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.439
Violence, aggression...

134
00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:12.283
...and insanity.

135
00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:15.088
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

136
00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:19.004
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...

137
00:11:19.169 --> 00:11:21.967
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

138
00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:26.764
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

139
00:11:27.969 --> 00:11:30.278
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

140
00:11:31.409 --> 00:11:33.161
I'll be frank with you.

141
00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:38.039
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

142
00:11:38.209 --> 00:11:40.848
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

143
00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:43.807
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.

144
00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:47.883
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

145
00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:51.962
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

146
00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:56.407
...l'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

147
00:11:58.129 --> 00:11:59.721
Gentlemen. Ladies.

148
00:12:04.609 --> 00:12:09.808
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voila! There is light.

149
00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:12.040
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

150
00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:16.839
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

151
00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:19.478
I'm already on my ass, May.

152
00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:23.961
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

153
00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:26.723
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

154
00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:29.159
Hand me that dish. The green one.

155
00:12:29.409 --> 00:12:32.048
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

156
00:12:32.489 --> 00:12:34.286
...and upsizing their profits.

157
00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:37.327
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

158
00:12:38.289 --> 00:12:41.087
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

159
00:12:42.169 --> 00:12:44.842
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

160
00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:46.567
Computer...

161
00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:50.364
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

162
00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:54.124
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

163
00:12:54.409 --> 00:12:59.483
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

164
00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:02.442
I love you. And Peter loves you.

165
00:13:02.689 --> 00:13:05.806
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

166
00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:10.281
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

167
00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:15.487
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

168
00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:18.123
How you doing? How was the field trip?

169
00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:21.008
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

170
00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:23.558
- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.

171
00:13:23.729 --> 00:13:26.038
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

172
00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:29.568
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

173
00:13:30.929 --> 00:13:32.442
What's that all about?

174
00:13:52.849 --> 00:13:54.965
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

175
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:59.566
<i>...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

176
00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:02.681
<i>...combining the genetic
information from all three...</i>

177
00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:07.485
<i>...into these 15 genetically
designed super- spiders.</i>

178
00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:25.157
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

179
00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:28.526
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

180
00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:32.204
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

181
00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:34.485
Don't be a coward.

182
00:14:34.929 --> 00:14:37.397
Risks are part of laboratory science.

183
00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:41.158
Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.

184
00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:43.724
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?

185
00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:48.201
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

186
00:14:48.369 --> 00:14:51.008
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

187
00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:53.729
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

188
00:14:53.889 --> 00:14:57.484
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

189
00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:01.881
40,000 years of evolution...

190
00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:05.644
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

191
00:15:18.929 --> 00:15:20.203
Oh, that's cold.

192
00:16:16.289 --> 00:16:17.483
Norman?

193
00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:23.037
Norman!

194
00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:34.603
Oh, my God.

195
00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:37.402
Oh, my God!

196
00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:41.721
Oh, my God! Norman!

197
00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:59.007
Back to formula?

198
00:17:32.209 --> 00:17:33.642
Weird.

199
00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.448
- Peter?
- Yeah?

200
00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:47.321
Are you all right?

201
00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:50.727
I'm fine.

202
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:54.520
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

203
00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:57.320
Yep. Big change.

204
00:17:57.489 --> 00:18:01.323
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

205
00:18:18.969 --> 00:18:20.288
Okay.

206
00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:28.438
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

207
00:18:28.969 --> 00:18:30.243
- I got better.
- See?

208
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:33.640
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

209
00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:37.324
Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.

210
00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:40.162
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

211
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.360
And don't start up with me.

212
00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:47.404
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

213
00:18:48.329 --> 00:18:51.878
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

214
00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:55.485
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

215
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:13.761
Hi, M.J.

216
00:19:14.609 --> 00:19:16.042
Hey, M.J.

217
00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:20.646
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

218
00:19:20.809 --> 00:19:24.006
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

219
00:19:24.209 --> 00:19:25.437
I got the car. Hop in.

220
00:19:25.609 --> 00:19:28.362
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

221
00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:32.244
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

222
00:19:32.489 --> 00:19:33.683
Or not.

223
00:19:38.929 --> 00:19:41.523
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

224
00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:45.443
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

225
00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:47.407
Tell him to stop.

226
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:49.960
- Check him out!
- Dork!

227
00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:12.723
Dad!

228
00:20:13.169 --> 00:20:14.966
Dad, are you all right?

229
00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:16.997
Harry.

230
00:20:20.209 --> 00:20:22.120
What are you doing on the floor?

231
00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:23.563
I don't know.

232
00:20:24.369 --> 00:20:26.599
Have you been there all night?

233
00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:29.723
Last night I was...

234
00:20:31.969 --> 00:20:33.163
What?

235
00:20:34.369 --> 00:20:36.678
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

236
00:20:36.889 --> 00:20:38.481
Sir, I asked her to wait.

237
00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:42.801
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

238
00:20:42.969 --> 00:20:43.958
What?

239
00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:47.565
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

240
00:20:47.729 --> 00:20:50.960
- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

241
00:20:51.129 --> 00:20:53.040
- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.

242
00:21:16.969 --> 00:21:19.608
Wow! Great reflexes!

243
00:21:20.449 --> 00:21:22.519
- Thanks.
- No problem.

244
00:21:23.569 --> 00:21:27.323
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

245
00:21:28.049 --> 00:21:29.641
You just get contacts?

246
00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.199
Well, see you.

247
00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:21.645
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

248
00:22:22.089 --> 00:22:23.408
Did you see that?

249
00:22:24.929 --> 00:22:26.521
Parker?

250
00:22:57.089 --> 00:22:59.398
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?

251
00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:02.447
- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.

252
00:23:02.649 --> 00:23:05.243
- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.

253
00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:08.685
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

254
00:23:26.809 --> 00:23:28.083
Help him, Harry.

255
00:23:32.849 --> 00:23:34.282
How'd he do that?

256
00:23:35.329 --> 00:23:36.523
Which one?

257
00:23:36.689 --> 00:23:38.008
He's all yours, man.

258
00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:54.527
Flash, get up!

259
00:23:56.089 --> 00:23:59.081
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

260
00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:02.362
That was amazing.

261
00:24:03.249 --> 00:24:05.160
I'm out of here. Come on.

262
00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:47.038
Go, web!

263
00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:50.127
Fly.

264
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:53.640
Up, up and away, web.

265
00:25:55.169 --> 00:25:56.522
Shazam!

266
00:25:57.089 --> 00:25:58.283
Go! Go!

267
00:25:58.529 --> 00:26:00.201
Go, web, go!

268
00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:33.641
Tallyho.

269
00:27:12.337 --> 00:27:15.688
Michelangelo!
Meat loaf and veggies in oven.

270
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:18.237
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

271
00:27:18.449 --> 00:27:19.643
Bring me some beer.

272
00:27:19.849 --> 00:27:22.283
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

273
00:27:22.449 --> 00:27:23.882
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

274
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:26.279
You're as stupid as your mother.

275
00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:30.563
Where's she going?
Where you going?

276
00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:34.806
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

277
00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:38.160
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

278
00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:42.328
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

279
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:44.918
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

280
00:27:45.249 --> 00:27:48.366
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

281
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:51.168
I guess you can always hear us.

282
00:27:51.329 --> 00:27:53.524
Everybody shouts.

283
00:27:53.969 --> 00:27:56.005
Your aunt and uncle don't.

284
00:27:56.169 --> 00:27:58.603
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

285
00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:04.008
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

286
00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:05.807
You really freaked us out.

287
00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:08.159
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

288
00:28:08.449 --> 00:28:12.237
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

289
00:28:15.209 --> 00:28:18.281
So where are you going
after you graduate?

290
00:28:22.849 --> 00:28:25.044
I wanna move into the city.

291
00:28:25.929 --> 00:28:30.525
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

292
00:28:30.689 --> 00:28:33.408
Work my way through college.

293
00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:35.643
What about you?

294
00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:37.720
Headed for the city too.

295
00:28:38.409 --> 00:28:40.559
Can't wait to get out of here.

296
00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:43.122
I wanna...

297
00:28:44.329 --> 00:28:45.762
What?

298
00:28:48.489 --> 00:28:50.639
No, come on. Try me.

299
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:52.962
I wanna...

300
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:55.323
...act...

301
00:28:56.449 --> 00:28:57.882
...on-stage.

302
00:28:58.449 --> 00:29:00.201
Really?

303
00:29:00.569 --> 00:29:02.639
Oh, that's perfect.

304
00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:05.363
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

305
00:29:05.689 --> 00:29:07.441
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:29:08.049 --> 00:29:10.927
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

307
00:29:11.409 --> 00:29:13.525
Peter, that was first grade.

308
00:29:14.009 --> 00:29:15.442
Well...

309
00:29:15.969 --> 00:29:17.402
...even so.

310
00:29:18.369 --> 00:29:20.200
Sometimes...

311
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:22.601
...you know people.

312
00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:27.165
You can just see what's coming.

313
00:29:30.129 --> 00:29:32.768
What do you see coming for you?

314
00:29:35.249 --> 00:29:36.841
I don't know.

315
00:29:39.089 --> 00:29:43.560
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

316
00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:49.807
And what for me?

317
00:29:49.969 --> 00:29:51.243
For you?

318
00:29:52.609 --> 00:29:55.248
You're gonna light up Broadway.

319
00:29:56.689 --> 00:29:57.963
You know...

320
00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:04.683
...you're taller than you look.

321
00:30:04.849 --> 00:30:06.328
I hunch.

322
00:30:08.489 --> 00:30:09.922
Don't.

323
00:30:13.329 --> 00:30:16.719
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

324
00:30:17.769 --> 00:30:18.997
Come on.

325
00:30:20.049 --> 00:30:21.323
I gotta go.

326
00:30:22.129 --> 00:30:23.244
Bye.

327
00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:26.449
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

328
00:30:26.609 --> 00:30:28.520
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

329
00:30:28.689 --> 00:30:30.839
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

330
00:30:31.089 --> 00:30:32.602
Pretty tight, huh?

331
00:30:33.009 --> 00:30:37.161
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

332
00:30:38.849 --> 00:30:40.043
Cool car.

333
00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:10.925
What's going on in there?

334
00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:13.643
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

335
00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:17.324
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

336
00:32:17.609 --> 00:32:19.600
Okay. Thanks.

337
00:32:33.637 --> 00:32:36.187
Is this the End of
Norman Osborn?

338
00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:52.366
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

339
00:32:52.529 --> 00:32:55.089
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

340
00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:57.805
I just don't know anymore.

341
00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:00.643
I'm going to the library.
See you later.

342
00:33:00.849 --> 00:33:04.080
- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.

343
00:33:04.249 --> 00:33:07.366
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

344
00:33:17.969 --> 00:33:21.279
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.

345
00:33:21.449 --> 00:33:25.647
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

346
00:33:26.489 --> 00:33:28.639
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

347
00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:32.688
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.

348
00:33:32.849 --> 00:33:37.639
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

349
00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:41.768
- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.

350
00:33:41.969 --> 00:33:44.802
- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?

351
00:33:45.009 --> 00:33:47.887
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

352
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:52.406
You're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

353
00:33:52.609 --> 00:33:54.520
No. Not exactly.

354
00:33:55.849 --> 00:33:58.443
These are the years
when a man changes...

355
00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:02.443
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

356
00:34:02.609 --> 00:34:05.567
Just be careful who you change into.

357
00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:11.361
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

358
00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:14.483
But just because you can
beat him up...

359
00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.079
...doesn't give you the right to.

360
00:34:17.729 --> 00:34:22.757
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

361
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:28.119
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

362
00:34:28.289 --> 00:34:31.565
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.

363
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:35.888
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.

364
00:34:36.049 --> 00:34:38.768
Then stop pretending to be!

365
00:34:42.689 --> 00:34:43.883
Right.

366
00:34:46.729 --> 00:34:48.606
I'll pick you up here at 10.

367
00:35:18.569 --> 00:35:20.489
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

368
00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:21.129
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

369
00:35:21.129 --> 00:35:24.166
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

370
00:35:28.689 --> 00:35:32.568
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

371
00:35:36.529 --> 00:35:38.645
Ladies and gentlemen...

372
00:35:38.809 --> 00:35:43.166
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

373
00:35:46.129 --> 00:35:49.644
For $3000...

374
00:35:49.809 --> 00:35:53.279
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

375
00:35:53.449 --> 00:35:57.965
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

376
00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:02.440
Who?

377
00:36:02.689 --> 00:36:04.486
I know who.

378
00:36:04.689 --> 00:36:09.285
The Flying Dutchman!

379
00:36:09.609 --> 00:36:11.008
Next.

380
00:36:11.809 --> 00:36:14.960
There's no featherweight
division here. Next.

381
00:36:15.129 --> 00:36:16.881
No, no. Sign me up.

382
00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:20.565
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

383
00:36:20.769 --> 00:36:24.762
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

384
00:36:24.969 --> 00:36:27.961
And you're participating
under your own free will?

385
00:36:28.129 --> 00:36:32.008
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

386
00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:36.639
Told you! Told you!

387
00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:38.567
Winner!

388
00:36:38.769 --> 00:36:39.918
Next victim!

389
00:36:41.729 --> 00:36:44.482
Are you ready for more?

390
00:36:45.569 --> 00:36:49.005
Bone Saw is ready!

391
00:36:51.329 --> 00:36:55.800
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

392
00:36:56.009 --> 00:37:00.525
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

393
00:37:00.769 --> 00:37:04.967
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

394
00:37:05.809 --> 00:37:08.687
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

395
00:37:09.249 --> 00:37:11.524
That's it? That's the best you got?

396
00:37:11.689 --> 00:37:13.725
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

397
00:37:13.889 --> 00:37:18.201
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

398
00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:21.486
...the terrifying, the deadly...

399
00:37:21.729 --> 00:37:24.801
...the amazing Spider-Man!

400
00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:29.603
- It's "The Human Spider."
- Get out there.

401
00:37:29.769 --> 00:37:32.681
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.

402
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:37.523
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

403
00:37:37.769 --> 00:37:39.725
I hope you brought your mommy.

404
00:37:39.889 --> 00:37:43.962
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

405
00:37:44.489 --> 00:37:49.404
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

406
00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:51.845
Oh, my God!

407
00:37:52.049 --> 00:37:53.607
Oh, my legs!

408
00:37:53.769 --> 00:37:56.283
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

409
00:37:56.449 --> 00:37:58.360
Kill! Kill! Kill!

410
00:38:06.289 --> 00:38:07.722
Cage! Cage! Cage!

411
00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:09.038
Cage!

412
00:38:18.009 --> 00:38:19.408
Hello? Guys?

413
00:38:20.409 --> 00:38:25.164
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

414
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:29.967
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

415
00:38:31.089 --> 00:38:33.478
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

416
00:38:33.689 --> 00:38:35.407
Hey, freak show!

417
00:38:35.609 --> 00:38:38.123
You're going nowhere.

418
00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:40.564
I got you for three minutes.

419
00:38:40.729 --> 00:38:42.924
Three minutes of playtime.

420
00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:52.599
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

421
00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:56.688
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

422
00:39:02.129 --> 00:39:03.608
Finish him off!

423
00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:11.968
Smash him!

424
00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:20.521
- Hit him!
- Harder!

425
00:39:22.449 --> 00:39:24.679
Kick his spider ass!

426
00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:27.724
Hit him!

427
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:42.327
One, two, three!

428
00:39:42.529 --> 00:39:45.202
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

429
00:39:45.369 --> 00:39:50.238
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

430
00:40:06.929 --> 00:40:08.521
Now get out of here.

431
00:40:10.089 --> 00:40:12.808
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

432
00:40:13.009 --> 00:40:15.284
Well, check it again, webhead.

433
00:40:15.449 --> 00:40:19.158
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

434
00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:22.600
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

435
00:40:22.769 --> 00:40:24.088
I need that money.

436
00:40:24.529 --> 00:40:27.487
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

437
00:40:35.249 --> 00:40:38.446
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

438
00:40:40.209 --> 00:40:41.483
Hurry up!

439
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:49.560
Hey! He stole the gate!

440
00:40:49.729 --> 00:40:51.606
Stop that guy!

441
00:40:51.889 --> 00:40:54.323
Stop him! He's got my money!

442
00:40:54.529 --> 00:40:55.723
Thanks.

443
00:40:56.929 --> 00:40:59.204
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

444
00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:01.519
Cut him off and call the cops!

445
00:41:01.689 --> 00:41:05.568
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.

446
00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:08.960
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

447
00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:27.769
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

448
00:41:27.769 --> 00:41:29.407
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

449
00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:31.928
Old dude, man.

450
00:41:32.129 --> 00:41:36.122
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

451
00:41:36.289 --> 00:41:39.008
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

452
00:41:41.289 --> 00:41:44.361
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

453
00:41:44.849 --> 00:41:46.601
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

454
00:41:48.689 --> 00:41:51.203
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

455
00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:54.719
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

456
00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:56.248
Uncle Ben?

457
00:41:57.129 --> 00:41:58.562
Uncle Ben.

458
00:42:02.169 --> 00:42:03.443
Uncle Ben?

459
00:42:06.929 --> 00:42:08.362
Peter.

460
00:42:09.209 --> 00:42:10.927
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

461
00:42:16.329 --> 00:42:17.478
Peter.

462
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:41.481
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

463
00:42:41.689 --> 00:42:46.205
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

464
00:45:16.889 --> 00:45:18.720
Get a unit to the rear!

465
00:45:21.649 --> 00:45:23.128
I got the back!

466
00:45:35.529 --> 00:45:36.803
Who's there?

467
00:46:02.009 --> 00:46:05.001
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

468
00:46:05.169 --> 00:46:09.481
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

469
00:46:09.649 --> 00:46:11.082
Answer me!

470
00:46:14.289 --> 00:46:15.563
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

471
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:22.447
<i>Thanks.</i>

472
00:46:31.929 --> 00:46:32.998
See you.

473
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:57.119
<i>Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.</i>

474
00:47:37.889 --> 00:47:40.449
Oh, no. My God.

475
00:47:42.249 --> 00:47:45.798
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

476
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:56.642
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

477
00:47:57.409 --> 00:48:00.162
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

478
00:48:00.329 --> 00:48:05.528
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

479
00:48:06.209 --> 00:48:09.599
- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?

480
00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:11.964
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.

481
00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:15.328
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

482
00:48:15.489 --> 00:48:19.243
Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.

483
00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:24.401
Preflight complete. Mark.

484
00:48:28.369 --> 00:48:30.883
<i>An unidentified object
is closing fast.</i>

485
00:48:31.049 --> 00:48:32.084
What's that?

486
00:48:32.249 --> 00:48:33.682
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

487
00:48:34.129 --> 00:48:35.448
Oh, my God!

488
00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:48.048
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

489
00:48:48.529 --> 00:48:50.326
Peter!

490
00:48:50.529 --> 00:48:54.886
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

491
00:48:55.049 --> 00:48:58.405
Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.

492
00:48:58.569 --> 00:49:00.048
- Great!
- You made it.

493
00:49:02.689 --> 00:49:05.886
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

494
00:49:07.249 --> 00:49:09.319
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

495
00:49:09.729 --> 00:49:12.197
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

496
00:49:12.609 --> 00:49:13.837
Yeah.

497
00:49:16.689 --> 00:49:19.920
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

498
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:23.206
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

499
00:49:23.409 --> 00:49:24.888
Commencement:

500
00:49:25.049 --> 00:49:29.008
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

501
00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:34.284
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

502
00:49:35.129 --> 00:49:36.926
You know what? Whatever.

503
00:49:37.449 --> 00:49:38.848
Your loss.

504
00:49:39.529 --> 00:49:42.919
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

505
00:49:43.089 --> 00:49:46.764
And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.

506
00:50:00.089 --> 00:50:02.239
Can I fix you something?

507
00:50:02.409 --> 00:50:03.842
No, thanks.

508
00:50:46.769 --> 00:50:48.885
I missed him a lot today.

509
00:50:51.369 --> 00:50:52.802
I know.

510
00:50:54.489 --> 00:50:56.241
I miss him too.

511
00:50:57.929 --> 00:51:00.159
But he was there.

512
00:51:03.209 --> 00:51:08.203
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

513
00:51:08.489 --> 00:51:13.199
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

514
00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:16.880
You loved him...

515
00:51:18.489 --> 00:51:20.639
...and he loved you.

516
00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:25.004
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

517
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:28.479
How you were meant for great things.

518
00:51:29.009 --> 00:51:31.239
You won't disappoint him.

519
00:52:03.409 --> 00:52:07.402
<i>With great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

520
00:52:07.569 --> 00:52:10.641
<i>Remember that, Pete. Remember that.</i>

521
00:52:20.249 --> 00:52:21.443
Hurry up!

522
00:52:33.329 --> 00:52:36.924
He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.

523
00:52:37.089 --> 00:52:40.161
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

524
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:46.728
Bobby. Get a load of this!

525
00:52:49.769 --> 00:52:53.842
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.

526
00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:58.088
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

527
00:52:58.249 --> 00:53:00.763
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

528
00:53:00.929 --> 00:53:03.568
Some kind of freakyloo or something.

529
00:53:03.729 --> 00:53:05.685
He stinks and I don't like him.

530
00:53:06.369 --> 00:53:07.882
Don't move, lady!

531
00:53:13.627 --> 00:53:15.459
Courtesy, Your Friendly
Neighborhood Spider-Man

532
00:53:15.649 --> 00:53:18.288
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

533
00:53:18.489 --> 00:53:20.525
Those tights and that tight little...

534
00:53:20.689 --> 00:53:23.886
<i>Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug</i>

535
00:53:24.089 --> 00:53:27.684
<i>But we should all just give him
One big hug</i>

536
00:53:27.889 --> 00:53:32.280
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider- Man</i>

537
00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:39.404
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

538
00:53:39.569 --> 00:53:41.609
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

539
00:53:41.609 --> 00:53:42.929
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

540
00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:43.409
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

541
00:53:43.409 --> 00:53:44.849
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

542
00:53:45.809 --> 00:53:46.609
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

543
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:48.839
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

544
00:53:49.009 --> 00:53:50.488
- Well?
- He's news.

545
00:53:50.689 --> 00:53:53.078
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

546
00:53:53.249 --> 00:53:57.083
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

547
00:53:57.249 --> 00:54:01.242
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.

548
00:54:01.409 --> 00:54:05.197
He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!

549
00:54:05.369 --> 00:54:08.042
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?

550
00:54:08.209 --> 00:54:11.121
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

551
00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:13.644
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:

552
00:54:13.809 --> 00:54:17.484
We double-booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...

553
00:54:17.649 --> 00:54:20.686
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

554
00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:21.998
Every copy.

555
00:54:22.769 --> 00:54:26.205
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.

556
00:54:26.369 --> 00:54:29.167
- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.

557
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:30.921
- That can't be done.
- Get out!

558
00:54:31.089 --> 00:54:35.765
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.

559
00:54:35.929 --> 00:54:37.965
Aw, what is he, shy?

560
00:54:38.129 --> 00:54:41.963
If we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

561
00:54:42.129 --> 00:54:45.405
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider-Man picture."

562
00:54:45.569 --> 00:54:48.879
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

563
00:55:00.849 --> 00:55:02.202
Buzz off.

564
00:55:02.889 --> 00:55:05.722
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

565
00:55:07.369 --> 00:55:12.045
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

566
00:55:12.529 --> 00:55:16.078
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?

567
00:55:16.249 --> 00:55:17.238
Yeah.

568
00:55:17.449 --> 00:55:21.158
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

569
00:55:21.329 --> 00:55:22.444
That's great.

570
00:55:23.009 --> 00:55:26.081
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

571
00:55:26.249 --> 00:55:27.807
Your drawer was short $6!

572
00:55:27.969 --> 00:55:30.483
Next time, I'll take it
from your check.

573
00:55:31.529 --> 00:55:35.158
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

574
00:55:35.369 --> 00:55:37.564
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

575
00:55:37.729 --> 00:55:41.688
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

576
00:55:48.369 --> 00:55:50.007
Some dream, huh?

577
00:55:50.849 --> 00:55:53.363
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

578
00:55:53.529 --> 00:55:56.202
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

579
00:55:56.609 --> 00:56:01.000
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

580
00:56:01.409 --> 00:56:02.922
Oh, yeah. Right.

581
00:56:03.169 --> 00:56:06.127
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

582
00:56:06.289 --> 00:56:10.521
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

583
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:15.001
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

584
00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:18.280
No, I guess not.
