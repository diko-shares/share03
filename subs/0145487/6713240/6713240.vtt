00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.273
<i>Who am I? You sure you wanna know?</i>

2
00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:14.735
<i>The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.</i>

3
00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:17.529
<i>If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...</i>

4
00:03:17.738 --> 00:03:22.200
<i>...if somebody told you I was just your
average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

5
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.161
<i>...somebody lied.</i>

6
00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:28.623
<i>But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...</i>

7
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.209
...is <i>all about a girl.</i>

8
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:35.547
<i>That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.</i>

9
00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.801
<i>The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.</i>

10
00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.637
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.</i>

11
00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:43.263
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

12
00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:47.726
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.895
<i>That's me.</i>

14
00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:51.980
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.398
Stop!

16
00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:55.817
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.071
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

18
00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:02.366
- Catch a cab, Parker!
- Aww...

19
00:04:04.952 --> 00:04:06.703
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.461
What a geek!

21
00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.341
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:21.092
Would you date him?

23
00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:24.972
Uh-uh.

24
00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:41.363
Midtown High seniors.

25
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.200
No wandering. Proceed direct--
Knock it off.

26
00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:48.828
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

27
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.458
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

28
00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:54.876
So behave accordingly.

29
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:58.088
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

30
00:04:58.297 --> 00:04:59.923
Come on, people, stay together.

31
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.009
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

32
00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:07.222
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

33
00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.350
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

34
00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:14.062
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

35
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.522
Why?

36
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:17.524
The entrance is right there.

37
00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:21.403
Dad, these are public-school kids. I'm not
showing up for the field trip in the Rolls.

38
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.905
What, you want me
to trade in my car for a Jetta...

39
00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:27.076
...because you flunked out of
every private school I ever sent you to?

40
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:30.246
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

41
00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:32.581
Don't ever be ashamed
of who you are.

42
00:05:32.748 --> 00:05:35.250
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

43
00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:36.751
It's just...

44
00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.378
Just what, Harry?

45
00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:40.088
Forget it.

46
00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:44.426
Pete!

47
00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.512
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

48
00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.055
Harry.

49
00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:50.432
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks, Dad.

50
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:53.769
Peter, may I introduce my father,
Norman Osborn.

51
00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:55.354
I've heard so much about you.

52
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:59.024
- Great honor to meet you, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

53
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:02.111
You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

54
00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.447
I read all your research
on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.

55
00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:08.158
- And you understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

56
00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:12.121
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

57
00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.123
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are proud.

58
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.875
Hey, you two! Let's move!

59
00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:20.712
- Nice to meet you. Yeah.
- Hope to see you again.

60
00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:26.551
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Yeah, not if you're a genius.

61
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.679
- I think he wants to adopt you.
- Heh.

62
00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:29.471
There are over 32,000 known
species of spider in the world.

63
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:33.558
There are over 32,000 known
species of spider in the world.

64
00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:36.478
They're in the order <I>Araneae</I>,
divided into three suborders.

65
00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:38.855
Wow. That's amazing.

66
00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:42.943
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

67
00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:45.320
- It's unreal.
- Wow.

68
00:06:45.487 --> 00:06:48.281
Arachnids
from all three groups possess...

69
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.868
...varying strengths which help them
in their constant search for food.

70
00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:56.415
For example, the Delena spider,
family <i>Sparassidae</i>...

71
00:06:56.582 --> 00:07:00.752
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

72
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.505
- For the school paper?
- Mm-hm.

73
00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:11.676
Next, we have the net web spider,
family <i>Filistatidae</i>...

74
00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:14.265
genus <i>Kukulcania</i>.

75
00:07:14.516 --> 00:07:18.853
It spins an intricate funnel-shaped web
whose strands have a tensile strength...

76
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:23.521
...proportionately equal to the type
of high-tension wires used in bridges.

77
00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.445
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

78
00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.447
Or his father will fire your father.

79
00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.367
What's Daddy gonna do?
Sue me?

80
00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:35.036
What is going on?

81
00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:38.290
The next person who talks will fail
this course. I kid you not.

82
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:40.501
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.

83
00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:44.838
...hunts using a set of reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

84
00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:48.550
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

85
00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:50.885
- An early awareness of danger.
- Those guys are jerks.

86
00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:52.846
A spider-sense.

87
00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.140
Hey, look at that spider.

88
00:07:55.307 --> 00:07:59.728
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

89
00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.897
It's a defense mechanism.

90
00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:05.358
Peter, what makes you think
I would want to know that?

91
00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:06.735
Who wouldn't?

92
00:08:06.902 --> 00:08:10.739
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility...

93
00:08:10.906 --> 00:08:15.285
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

94
00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.412
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

95
00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:20.248
...we have now begun
what was once thought impossible.

96
00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:24.127
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

97
00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:25.712
I love them.

98
00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:27.923
Yeah, me too.

99
00:08:28.882 --> 00:08:32.760
You know, spiders
can change their color...

100
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:36.765
- ...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

101
00:08:36.932 --> 00:08:41.144
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

102
00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:44.647
Transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

103
00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:47.943
...combining the genetic information
from all three spiders...

104
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.610
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

105
00:08:52.948 --> 00:08:54.449
There's 14.

106
00:08:54.908 --> 00:08:56.284
I beg your pardon?

107
00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:58.537
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

108
00:08:58.704 --> 00:08:59.705
Huh.

109
00:09:01.915 --> 00:09:04.542
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

110
00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:08.380
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope...

111
00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:09.798
...on the Eastern Seaboard?

112
00:09:09.965 --> 00:09:14.010
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

113
00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:15.888
Let's go talk about
how we listen.

114
00:09:20.017 --> 00:09:24.104
Now, I don't know what
it's like at those fancy private schools...

115
00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.189
...but at Midtown High...

116
00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:33.988
Hey-

117
00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:38.409
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

118
00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:40.161
- Sure. Yeah.
- Great.

119
00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.539
Where do you want me?
Over here?

120
00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:44.082
Yeah, that's great.

121
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.168
Don't make me look ugly.

122
00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:48.378
That's impossible.

123
00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:56.887
Perfect.

124
00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:06.188
- Is that good?
- Great.

125
00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:12.861
That's great.

126
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.702
M.J., let's go!

127
00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:24.831
Wait. Thanks!

128
00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:41.055
Parker, let's do it.

129
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:01.242
We solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

130
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.954
I've already seen the glider.

131
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:06.414
That's not what I'm here for.

132
00:11:06.623 --> 00:11:09.292
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

133
00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:12.295
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

134
00:11:12.462 --> 00:11:14.380
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

135
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:18.093
Always a pleasure to have our
board of directors pay us a little visit.

136
00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:21.722
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

137
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:24.349
We tried vapor inhalation
with rodent subjects.

138
00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:26.351
They showed an 800% increase in strength!

139
00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:28.478
- That's excellent.
- Any side effects?

140
00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:29.687
In one trial, yes.

141
00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.535
It was an aberration. All the tests
since then have been successful.

142
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.776
And in the trial that went wrong,
what happened?

143
00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:36.444
What were the side effects?

144
00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:38.947
Violence, aggression...

145
00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:40.866
...and insanity.

146
00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.785
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

147
00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:47.873
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our entire staff certifies the product...

148
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.959
- ...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

149
00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:54.921
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

150
00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.635
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

151
00:12:00.802 --> 00:12:02.637
I'll be frank with you.

152
00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:07.388
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

153
00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:10.645
Norman, the general gave
the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace...

154
00:12:10.812 --> 00:12:13.731
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

155
00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:17.652
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

156
00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:22.240
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

157
00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:26.870
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

158
00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:30.332
Gentlemen. Ladies.

159
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.920
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voile! There is light.

160
00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:43.178
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

161
00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:47.432
Mm. Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

162
00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:50.935
Heh, heh. I'm already on my ass, May.

163
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:55.603
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

164
00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:58.485
...what else would you call it?
I am on my ass.

165
00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:01.029
Hand me that dish.
The green one.

166
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.032
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

167
00:13:04.491 --> 00:13:06.367
...and upsizing their profits.

168
00:13:06.618 --> 00:13:09.704
Oh, Ben,
you'll get another job somewhere.

169
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:13.457
Yeah, well...
Well, let's look in the paper and see.

170
00:13:14.584 --> 00:13:17.378
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

171
00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:19.172
Computer.

172
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:23.134
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

173
00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:27.055
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

174
00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:29.658
May, I'm 68 years old.
I'm too old for computers,

175
00:13:29.682 --> 00:13:31.847
and besides, I have
a family to provide for.

176
00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:35.730
I love you. And Peter loves you.

177
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.234
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

178
00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:42.737
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

179
00:13:42.904 --> 00:13:43.905
Yeah.

180
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:48.823
Oh. Hi, sweetie. You're just--
Just in time for dinner.

181
00:13:49.536 --> 00:13:52.080
Hey. How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

182
00:13:52.247 --> 00:13:55.083
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

183
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.752
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks. Had a bite.

184
00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:00.338
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

185
00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:04.008
Uh-- I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

186
00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:07.011
What's that all about?

187
00:14:28.283 --> 00:14:30.493
In this recombination lab...

188
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.160
<i>...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

189
00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:38.543
<i>...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...</i>

190
00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:43.252
<i>...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.</i>

191
00:14:58.021 --> 00:15:01.983
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

192
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.486
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

193
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:09.324
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

194
00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:11.701
Don't be a coward.

195
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.745
Risks are part of laboratory science.

196
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:18.667
Let me reschedule, with
a proper medical staff and a volunteer.

197
00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:22.336
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks? In two weeks...

198
00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:26.007
...we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

199
00:15:26.174 --> 00:15:28.926
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

200
00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.763
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

201
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.975
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

202
00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:40.271
Forty thousand years of evolution...

203
00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:44.192
...and we've barely even tapped
the vastness of human potential.

204
00:15:58.039 --> 00:15:59.373
Oh, that's cold.

205
00:16:58.099 --> 00:16:59.100
Norman?

206
00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:04.897
Norman!

207
00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.108
Norman!

208
00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:16.951
Oh, my God.

209
00:17:18.286 --> 00:17:21.580
Oh, my God! Norman?

210
00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:24.376
Oh, my God! Norman!

211
00:17:26.586 --> 00:17:27.712
Norman.

212
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:41.976
Back to formula?

213
00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:18.513
Weird.

214
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:30.817
- Peter?
- Yeah?

215
00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:32.068
Are you all right?

216
00:18:32.235 --> 00:18:33.236
Uh...

217
00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.322
I'm fine.

218
00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:38.741
Any better this morning? Any change?

219
00:18:38.908 --> 00:18:40.576
Change?

220
00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.204
Yep. Big change.

221
00:18:43.371 --> 00:18:47.458
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

222
00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:07.145
Okay.

223
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:15.653
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. Heh. I thought you were sick.

224
00:19:16.196 --> 00:19:17.530
- I got better.
- You see?

225
00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:21.075
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

226
00:19:21.242 --> 00:19:24.912
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're
painting the kitchen right after school.

227
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.874
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

228
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:29.125
And don't start up with me.

229
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:35.423
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

230
00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:40.095
You're trash! You're always gonna
be trash, just like her!

231
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:43.847
- I have to go to school.
- Ah, who's stopping you?

232
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:02.909
Hi, M.J.

233
00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:05.286
Hey, M.J.

234
00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:10.037
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

235
00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:12.793
And I was wondering if maybe
we could get together sometime?

236
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:15.338
Hey, M.J., I got the car. Hop in.

237
00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:18.132
Do something fun'? Or, I don't know.

238
00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:21.051
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

239
00:20:22.429 --> 00:20:23.680
Or not.

240
00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:31.855
- Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Hey!

241
00:20:32.063 --> 00:20:33.064
Hey!

242
00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:35.274
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

243
00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:37.985
Tell him to stop.

244
00:20:38.653 --> 00:20:40.655
- Check him out!
- Dork!

245
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:04.387
Dad.

246
00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:06.722
Dad, are you all right?

247
00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:08.849
Harry.

248
00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:14.189
What are you doing on the floor?

249
00:21:14.355 --> 00:21:15.689
I don't know.

250
00:21:16.524 --> 00:21:19.360
- Have you been there all night?
- Uh--

251
00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:22.113
Last night I was--

252
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:25.700
What?

253
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:28.702
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

254
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.247
Sir, I asked her to wait
in the foyer.

255
00:21:31.414 --> 00:21:35.793
- Sorry, my father's not feeling well.
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

256
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.961
What?

257
00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:40.673
They found his body this morning
in the lab. He's been murdered, sir.

258
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.049
What are you talking about?

259
00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:44.177
And the flight suit and the glider...

260
00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:46.429
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.

261
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:14.123
Wow! Great reflexes!

262
00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:17.167
- Thanks.
- No problem.

263
00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:22.173
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

264
00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:24.592
You just get contacts?

265
00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:33.476
Well, see you.

266
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.813
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

267
00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:20.648
Did you see that?

268
00:23:22.233 --> 00:23:23.901
Parker?

269
00:23:55.808 --> 00:23:58.101
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny, freak?

270
00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:01.313
- Flash, it was an accident.
- So is my fist breaking your teeth.

271
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:04.192
- Come on, Flash, stop.
- I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

272
00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:06.819
- I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
- Kick his ass, man.

273
00:24:16.537 --> 00:24:17.913
Huh.

274
00:24:21.876 --> 00:24:23.210
Whoa!

275
00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:28.049
Help him, Harry.

276
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:31.635
Whoa!

277
00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:34.555
How'd he do that?

278
00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:36.890
Which one?

279
00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:38.434
He's all yours, man.

280
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.660
Flash, get up!

281
00:24:57.286 --> 00:25:00.414
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

282
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.751
Peter, that was--
That was amazing.

283
00:25:04.752 --> 00:25:06.754
I'm out of here. Come on.

284
00:25:09.924 --> 00:25:11.091
Peter!

285
00:26:16.699 --> 00:26:19.535
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

286
00:26:27.293 --> 00:26:29.503
Ya-hoo!

287
00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:32.631
Whoo! Whoo!

288
00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:52.944
Go, web!

289
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.196
Fly.

290
00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.867
Up, up and away, web.

291
00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.870
Shazam!

292
00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:04.705
Go! GO!

293
00:27:04.872 --> 00:27:06.707
Go, web, go!

294
00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.575
Tallyho.

295
00:28:25.494 --> 00:28:28.079
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

296
00:28:28.247 --> 00:28:29.539
Bring me some beer!

297
00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:32.293
- Get up off your ass!
- I paid for beer--

298
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.961
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

299
00:28:34.128 --> 00:28:36.463
You're as stupid as your mother.
Get away from me!

300
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:38.257
You are drunk, do you know that?

301
00:28:38.424 --> 00:28:41.677
Where's she going? Where you going?

302
00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:45.347
These dishes are not done.
Somebody's gotta do the dishes.

303
00:28:45.556 --> 00:28:48.850
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

304
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.687
You do them. They're yours, anyway.

305
00:28:51.854 --> 00:28:53.188
I'm going out!

306
00:28:53.397 --> 00:28:55.899
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

307
00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:59.487
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

308
00:28:59.654 --> 00:29:02.406
- I guess you can always hear us.
- Well...

309
00:29:02.573 --> 00:29:04.866
...everybody shouts.

310
00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.327
Your aunt and uncle don't.

311
00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:10.205
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

312
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:15.878
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash--

313
00:29:16.128 --> 00:29:17.712
You really freaked us out.

314
00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:20.215
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

315
00:29:20.508 --> 00:29:24.470
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

316
00:29:27.556 --> 00:29:30.767
So where are you going
after you graduate?

317
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.229
I, uh...

318
00:29:35.523 --> 00:29:37.816
I wanna move into the city.

319
00:29:38.734 --> 00:29:43.234
And hopefully get a job
as a photographer.

320
00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:45.282
Work my way through college.

321
00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:48.869
What about you?

322
00:29:49.036 --> 00:29:51.038
Headed for the city too.

323
00:29:51.747 --> 00:29:53.999
Can't wait to get out of here.

324
00:29:55.167 --> 00:29:56.668
I wanna...

325
00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.421
What?

326
00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:04.426
No, come on. Try me.

327
00:30:05.428 --> 00:30:06.929
I wanna...

328
00:30:08.055 --> 00:30:09.389
...act...

329
00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:12.059
...on-stage.

330
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.561
Really?

331
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.938
Oh, that's perfect.

332
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:19.775
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

333
00:30:20.109 --> 00:30:21.944
- Really?
- Yeah.

334
00:30:22.611 --> 00:30:25.572
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

335
00:30:26.073 --> 00:30:28.283
Peter, that was first grade.

336
00:30:28.784 --> 00:30:30.285
Well...

337
00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:32.329
...even SO.

338
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:35.249
Sometimes...

339
00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:37.751
...you know people.

340
00:30:38.919 --> 00:30:42.505
You can just see what's coming.

341
00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:48.345
What do you see coming for you?

342
00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:52.599
I don't know.

343
00:30:54.935 --> 00:30:59.435
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

344
00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:06.113
And what for me?

345
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.614
For you?

346
00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:10.451
You're gonna light up Broadway.

347
00:31:13.287 --> 00:31:14.621
You know...

348
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:20.836
...you're taller than you look.

349
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:23.339
I hunch.

350
00:31:25.466 --> 00:31:27.092
Don't.

351
00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:34.224
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

352
00:31:35.267 --> 00:31:36.559
Come on.

353
00:31:37.311 --> 00:31:38.979
I gotta go.

354
00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:40.981
Bye.

355
00:31:41.649 --> 00:31:44.318
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right?

356
00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:46.487
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

357
00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:48.906
Oh, my God! What a cool car!

358
00:31:49.156 --> 00:31:50.740
Pretty tight, huh?

359
00:31:51.158 --> 00:31:55.453
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

360
00:31:55.746 --> 00:31:56.997
- Woo-hoo!
- Whoo!

361
00:31:57.164 --> 00:31:58.498
Cool car.

362
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:30.257
Peter?

363
00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.260
What's going on in there?

364
00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:36.096
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

365
00:33:36.263 --> 00:33:39.933
Well, you're acting so strangely, Peter.

366
00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:42.311
Okay. Thanks.

367
00:33:48.275 --> 00:33:49.609
Phew.

368
00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:16.469
Something's bothering him. Maybe he's
too embarrassed to tell me what it is.

369
00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:19.306
Maybe I'm too embarrassed
to ask him.

370
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:22.142
I just don't know anymore.

371
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.895
I'm going to the downtown library.
I'll see you later.

372
00:34:25.062 --> 00:34:28.690
- Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- No, I'll take the train.

373
00:34:28.857 --> 00:34:32.110
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

374
00:34:43.163 --> 00:34:46.624
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait a minute, we need to talk.

375
00:34:46.792 --> 00:34:51.171
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

376
00:34:52.047 --> 00:34:54.257
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

377
00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.301
Because we haven't talked
at all for so long.

378
00:34:56.468 --> 00:34:58.470
Your Aunt May and I
don't know who you are anymore.

379
00:34:58.637 --> 00:35:03.137
You shirk your chores. You have
all those weird experiments in your room.

380
00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:06.636
- You start fights at school--
- I didn't start that fight,

381
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.980
I told you that.

382
00:35:08.188 --> 00:35:09.567
Well you sure as hell finished it.

383
00:35:09.591 --> 00:35:11.349
- What was I supposed to do, run away?
- No.

384
00:35:11.358 --> 00:35:14.361
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but--

385
00:35:14.528 --> 00:35:16.404
Pete, look, you're changing. I know.

386
00:35:16.572 --> 00:35:19.074
I went through exactly the same thing
at your age.

387
00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:20.826
No. Not exactly.

388
00:35:20.993 --> 00:35:22.119
Peter...

389
00:35:22.661 --> 00:35:24.954
...these are the years
when a man changes...

390
00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:29.543
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

391
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.003
Just be careful
who you change into.

392
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.840
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

393
00:35:39.386 --> 00:35:42.097
But just because you can
beat him up...

394
00:35:42.556 --> 00:35:44.808
...doesn't give you the right to.

395
00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:49.976
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

396
00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:54.651
Are you afraid that I'm gonna
turn into some kind of criminal?

397
00:35:54.818 --> 00:35:56.319
Quit worrying about me, okay?

398
00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:59.907
Something's different. I'll figure it out.
Stop lecturing me. Please.

399
00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:02.659
I don't mean to lecture
and I don't mean to preach.

400
00:36:02.826 --> 00:36:04.410
And I know I'm not your father--

401
00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:07.414
Then stop pretending to be!

402
00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:12.753
Right.

403
00:36:15.714 --> 00:36:17.674
I'll pick you up here at 10.

404
00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:48.497
Ooh!

405
00:36:49.039 --> 00:36:53.539
<i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>

406
00:36:59.466 --> 00:37:03.511
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

407
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.056
<i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>

408
00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:07.474
Yeah.

409
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:09.851
Ladies and gentlemen...

410
00:37:10.018 --> 00:37:14.518
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

411
00:37:17.651 --> 00:37:21.321
For $3000..

412
00:37:21.488 --> 00:37:25.116
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

413
00:37:25.284 --> 00:37:29.784
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

414
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.668
Who?

415
00:37:34.918 --> 00:37:36.794
I know who.

416
00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:40.132
The Flying Dutchman!

417
00:37:42.134 --> 00:37:43.593
Next.

418
00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:47.722
There's no featherweight division
here, small fry. Next.

419
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.725
No, no. Sign me up.

420
00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:53.562
Okay. You understand
the NYWL is not responsible...

421
00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:57.858
...for any injury you may and probably will
sustain while participating in said event?

422
00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:00.318
And you're participating
under your own free will?

423
00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:01.528
Yes.

424
00:38:01.695 --> 00:38:05.490
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

425
00:38:08.076 --> 00:38:10.328
Told you! Told you!

426
00:38:10.537 --> 00:38:12.330
Winner!

427
00:38:12.539 --> 00:38:13.748
Next victim!

428
00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:18.503
Are you ready for more?

429
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.216
Bone Saw is ready!

430
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:30.136
Will the next victim
please enter the arena at this time?

431
00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:35.016
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

432
00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:39.857
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to--

433
00:38:40.734 --> 00:38:43.737
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

434
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.698
"The Human Spider"?
That's it? That's the best you got?

435
00:38:46.865 --> 00:38:48.992
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

436
00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:53.659
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

437
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:57.084
...the terrifying, the deadly...

438
00:38:57.334 --> 00:39:00.545
...the amazing Spider-Man!

439
00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:04.299
My name's "The Human Spider."

440
00:39:04.466 --> 00:39:05.717
I don't care, get out there.

441
00:39:05.884 --> 00:39:08.761
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, you moron.

442
00:39:11.223 --> 00:39:13.767
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

443
00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:16.061
I hope you brought your mommy.

444
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.773
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

445
00:39:21.066 --> 00:39:25.566
I'm gonna rip all eight of
your feeble legs off one by one.

446
00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:28.740
Oh, my God!

447
00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:30.575
Oh, my legs!

448
00:39:30.742 --> 00:39:33.369
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

449
00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:36.373
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

450
00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:46.674
Cage!

451
00:39:56.018 --> 00:39:57.436
Hello? Guys?

452
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.020
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

453
00:40:04.192 --> 00:40:08.487
Hey, listen, this is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

454
00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:12.159
Hey! Unlock the thing!
Take the chain off!

455
00:40:12.367 --> 00:40:16.867
Hey, freak show! You're going nowhere.

456
00:40:17.164 --> 00:40:19.541
I got you for three minutes.

457
00:40:19.708 --> 00:40:22.001
Three minutes of playtime.

458
00:40:26.506 --> 00:40:27.548
Ooh!

459
00:40:28.634 --> 00:40:31.428
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

460
00:40:32.304 --> 00:40:34.889
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

461
00:40:38.268 --> 00:40:40.103
Ooh!

462
00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:44.024
Finish him off!

463
00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:52.282
Smash him!

464
00:40:53.158 --> 00:40:56.035
<i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>

465
00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:01.207
- Hit him!
- Harder!

466
00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:06.588
- Yeah!
- Kick his spider ass! Yeah!

467
00:41:07.547 --> 00:41:08.714
Hit him!

468
00:41:22.145 --> 00:41:23.938
One, two, three!

469
00:41:24.147 --> 00:41:26.941
That's it! That's it! Winner!

470
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:29.736
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for the new champion...

471
00:41:29.903 --> 00:41:32.196
...Spider-Man!

472
00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:36.743
<i>CROWD".
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!</i>

473
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:51.257
Now get out of here.

474
00:41:52.884 --> 00:41:55.720
A hundred bucks'?
The ad said 3000.

475
00:41:55.929 --> 00:41:58.306
Well, check it again, webhead.

476
00:41:58.473 --> 00:42:02.351
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

477
00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:05.939
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

478
00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:07.482
I need that money.

479
00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:11.027
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

480
00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:22.455
- Hey, what the hell--?
- Put the money in the bag.

481
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.625
Hurry UP!

482
00:42:31.965 --> 00:42:34.050
Hey! He stole the gate!

483
00:42:34.217 --> 00:42:36.177
Stop that guy!

484
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:39.014
Stop him! He's got my money!

485
00:42:39.222 --> 00:42:40.473
Thanks.

486
00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:44.143
What's the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

487
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:46.521
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

488
00:42:46.688 --> 00:42:50.733
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

489
00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:53.153
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

490
00:43:12.672 --> 00:43:13.881
- Sir, you gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

491
00:43:13.882 --> 00:43:16.082
- Sir, you gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

492
00:43:16.843 --> 00:43:18.219
Old dude, man.

493
00:43:18.428 --> 00:43:22.598
Come on, folks. Keep moving,
please. Keep moving. Let's go!

494
00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:25.602
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

495
00:43:27.979 --> 00:43:31.190
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

496
00:43:31.691 --> 00:43:33.526
- Stay back! Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

497
00:43:35.695 --> 00:43:38.406
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

498
00:43:38.573 --> 00:43:41.993
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

499
00:43:42.202 --> 00:43:43.536
Uncle Ben?

500
00:43:44.496 --> 00:43:45.997
Uncle Ben.

501
00:43:49.751 --> 00:43:51.085
Uncle Ben?

502
00:43:54.714 --> 00:43:56.215
Peter.

503
00:43:57.092 --> 00:43:58.885
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

504
00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:05.975
Peter.

505
00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:30.750
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

506
00:44:30.959 --> 00:44:35.459
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

507
00:45:16.588 --> 00:45:17.922
Whoa.

508
00:45:51.623 --> 00:45:53.166
Whoa.

509
00:45:59.589 --> 00:46:01.048
Whoo!

510
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.474
Whoo!

511
00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:11.017
Hey! Hey!

512
00:47:12.787 --> 00:47:14.705
Get a unit to the rear!

513
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:19.294
I got the back!

514
00:47:32.223 --> 00:47:33.599
Who's there?

515
00:47:59.834 --> 00:48:02.920
Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!

516
00:48:03.129 --> 00:48:07.591
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

517
00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:09.302
- Ow!
- Answer me!

518
00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:13.973
Stop that guy!

519
00:48:19.437 --> 00:48:21.147
Thanks.

520
00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.158
See you.

521
00:48:32.534 --> 00:48:34.118
Ow! Ow!

522
00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:36.788
No.

523
00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:57.308
Freeze! We've
got the place completely surrounded.

524
00:49:39.809 --> 00:49:42.394
Oh, no. My God. Oh...

525
00:49:44.355 --> 00:49:48.067
Oh, no. Oh, my God. No!

526
00:49:56.409 --> 00:49:59.370
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

527
00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:03.040
Our exoskeleton's got real firepower,
General Slocum.

528
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:07.128
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

529
00:50:07.295 --> 00:50:09.755
<i>Eighteen. Seventeen. Sixteen...</i>

530
00:50:09.923 --> 00:50:11.132
He's clear, let's go!

531
00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:12.883
You're confident about this test?

532
00:50:13.092 --> 00:50:15.344
Absolutely.
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

533
00:50:16.095 --> 00:50:18.847
Now, what about your commitment
to OSCORP?

534
00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:22.893
Nothing would please me more than
to put Norman Osborn out of business.

535
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:28.315
Preflight complete. Mark.

536
00:50:32.445 --> 00:50:35.072
<i>We are picking
up an unidentified object, closing fast.</i>

537
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.367
- What the hell is that?
- Can you see anything?

538
00:50:38.701 --> 00:50:39.827
Oh, my God!

539
00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:52.965
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

540
00:50:53.466 --> 00:50:55.384
- Peter. Oh...
- Oh.

541
00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:59.472
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

542
00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:03.726
Pete? Good news. My father got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

543
00:51:03.893 --> 00:51:05.477
- That's great.
- You made it.

544
00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:11.567
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

545
00:51:12.986 --> 00:51:15.154
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

546
00:51:15.655 --> 00:51:18.115
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

547
00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.867
Yeah.

548
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:26.207
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

549
00:51:26.374 --> 00:51:29.001
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

550
00:51:29.836 --> 00:51:31.379
Commencement:

551
00:51:31.546 --> 00:51:35.675
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

552
00:51:36.217 --> 00:51:39.345
- Maybe I don't want to be with you.
- I don't want to be with you.

553
00:51:39.554 --> 00:51:41.180
Here's your ring.

554
00:51:42.056 --> 00:51:43.932
You know what? Whatever.

555
00:51:44.475 --> 00:51:45.934
Your loss.

556
00:51:46.644 --> 00:51:50.189
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

557
00:51:50.356 --> 00:51:53.317
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

558
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:09.500
Can I--? Can I fix you something?

559
00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:12.211
No, thanks.

560
00:52:56.756 --> 00:52:59.133
I missed him a lot today.

561
00:53:01.552 --> 00:53:03.053
I know.

562
00:53:04.806 --> 00:53:06.641
I miss him too.

563
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:10.728
But he was there.

564
00:53:13.898 --> 00:53:18.398
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

565
00:53:19.404 --> 00:53:23.904
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

566
00:53:26.077 --> 00:53:28.162
You loved him...

567
00:53:29.831 --> 00:53:32.083
...and he loved you.

568
00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:36.629
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

569
00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:40.257
How you were meant
for great things.

570
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.135
You won't disappoint him.

571
00:54:16.669 --> 00:54:20.839
<i>With great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

572
00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:24.218
<i>Remember that, Pete.
Remember that.</i>

573
00:54:34.228 --> 00:54:35.520
Hurry up!

574
00:54:47.867 --> 00:54:50.094
This is not a man.
My brother saw him building a nest

575
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:51.764
in the Lincoln Center fountain.

576
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:54.999
I think he's human. I think he's a man.
Could be a woman.

577
00:54:59.086 --> 00:55:01.838
Bobby. Get a load of this!

578
00:55:03.716 --> 00:55:04.967
Whoo!

579
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:07.052
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out,

580
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.263
and he climbs up the ropes
like a spider web.

581
00:55:09.555 --> 00:55:11.723
I see the web, and it's his signature.

582
00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:13.684
And I know Spider-Man was here.

583
00:55:13.851 --> 00:55:16.478
The guy protects us.
You know, he protects the people.

584
00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:19.398
Ah, some kind of freakyloo
or something. Wackadoo.

585
00:55:19.565 --> 00:55:21.567
He stinks and I don't like him.

586
00:55:21.734 --> 00:55:23.902
- Aah.
- Don't move, lady!

587
00:55:31.994 --> 00:55:34.746
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

588
00:55:34.956 --> 00:55:37.083
He has those tights
and that tight little--

589
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:40.586
♪ Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug ♪

590
00:55:40.795 --> 00:55:44.548
♪ But we should all just give him
One big hug ♪

591
00:55:44.757 --> 00:55:49.257
♪ Look out, ooh
Here comes the Spider-Man ♪

592
00:55:53.015 --> 00:55:56.768
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

593
00:55:56.936 --> 00:56:00.680
A vigilante, a public menace.
What's he doing on my front page?

594
00:56:00.699 --> 00:56:02.885
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife is on line one.
She needs to know--</i>

595
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:04.627
Mr. Jameson, there's a page six problem.

596
00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.612
We have a page one problem.
Shut up.

597
00:56:06.779 --> 00:56:08.322
- Well?
- He's news.

598
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:10.188
They're really important
clients, they can't wait.

599
00:56:10.212 --> 00:56:11.050
They're about to.

600
00:56:11.117 --> 00:56:15.204
- He pulled six people off that subway car.
- Sure, from a wreck he probably caused.

601
00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.182
Something goes wrong, and
this creepy crawler is there.

602
00:56:17.206 --> 00:56:19.541
Look at that. He's fleeing the scene.
What's that tell you?

603
00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:22.461
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

604
00:56:22.628 --> 00:56:23.629
He's a hero!

605
00:56:23.796 --> 00:56:26.632
Then why does he wear a mask? Hm?
What's he got to hide?

606
00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:29.760
She just needs to know if you want
chintz or chenille in the dining room.

607
00:56:29.927 --> 00:56:32.471
- Whichever one's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson, it's like this:

608
00:56:32.638 --> 00:56:33.972
We double-booked page six.

609
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.475
See, so both Macy's
and Conway's both have three quarters--

610
00:56:36.642 --> 00:56:39.770
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

611
00:56:39.937 --> 00:56:41.188
Every copy.

612
00:56:41.814 --> 00:56:44.334
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man, page one,
with a decent picture this time.

613
00:56:44.483 --> 00:56:46.295
- Move Conway to page seven.
- There's a problem with page seven--

614
00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:48.654
Then make it page eight, and give him
10% off. Eh, make it 5%.

615
00:56:48.821 --> 00:56:50.531
- That can't be done--
- Get out of here!

616
00:56:50.698 --> 00:56:52.658
Problem is,
we don't have a decent picture.

617
00:56:52.825 --> 00:56:55.536
Eddie's been on it for weeks.
We can barely get a glimpse of him.

618
00:56:55.703 --> 00:56:57.830
Aw, what is he, shy?

619
00:56:57.997 --> 00:57:00.100
If we can get a picture
of Julia Roberts in a thong

620
00:57:00.124 --> 00:57:02.000
we can certainly get
a picture of this weirdo.

621
00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:05.588
Put an ad on the front page:
"Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man."

622
00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:09.216
He doesn't wanna be famous?
Then I'll make him infamous!

623
00:57:20.436 --> 00:57:21.520
Hey!

624
00:57:21.687 --> 00:57:23.105
Buzz off.

625
00:57:23.814 --> 00:57:26.149
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi.

626
00:57:26.317 --> 00:57:28.027
Hey-

627
00:57:28.486 --> 00:57:31.864
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

628
00:57:32.323 --> 00:57:36.823
- Oh. I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?

629
00:57:37.745 --> 00:57:38.787
Yeah.

630
00:57:38.996 --> 00:57:42.874
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

631
00:57:43.042 --> 00:57:45.738
That's great, M.J.
You're doing it!

632
00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:47.413
- You're living your dream.
- Hey glamour girl!

633
00:57:47.421 --> 00:57:49.798
- Yeah.
- Your drawer was short $6.

634
00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:52.593
Next time that happens,
I'm gonna take it out of your check.

635
00:57:53.678 --> 00:57:57.473
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

636
00:57:57.682 --> 00:57:59.975
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

637
00:58:00.142 --> 00:58:04.271
It better not happen no more,
you hear me? Don't roll your eyes at me.

638
00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:12.363
Some dream, huh?

639
00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:16.450
That's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

640
00:58:16.617 --> 00:58:19.411
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

641
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:23.374
Aren't you guys living together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

642
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.418
Oh, yeah. Right.

643
00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:29.755
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

644
00:58:29.922 --> 00:58:34.343
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

645
00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:39.014
You know, Harry, he doesn't live
on a little place I like to call Earth.

646
00:58:40.516 --> 00:58:42.434
No, I guess not.

647
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.024
Thanks, Pete.

648
00:58:50.443 --> 00:58:52.361
We should catch up sometime.

649
00:58:56.574 --> 00:58:59.118
Let's get some lunch
some evening.

650
00:58:59.285 --> 00:59:03.785
Uh-- Well, I'll come by and have some
of your Moondance coffee some day.

651
00:59:05.082 --> 00:59:07.793
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

652
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.211
I won't.

653
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.131
I won't tell Harry.

654
00:59:24.435 --> 00:59:26.895
Timing's perfect. Hey.

655
00:59:27.104 --> 00:59:29.773
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

656
00:59:32.526 --> 00:59:35.195
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

657
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.282
Spent half of it on the phone.

658
00:59:38.866 --> 00:59:43.366
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

659
00:59:44.413 --> 00:59:45.705
Are you all right?

660
00:59:47.041 --> 00:59:50.419
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

661
00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.004
No, I, uh...

662
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.799
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

663
00:59:55.966 --> 00:59:57.550
You were late again?

664
00:59:58.177 --> 01:00:00.929
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

665
01:00:02.306 --> 01:00:03.557
Around.

666
01:00:03.724 --> 01:00:05.434
Peter Parker.

667
01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.270
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?

668
01:00:08.437 --> 01:00:11.481
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

669
01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:13.567
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad.

670
01:00:13.734 --> 01:00:17.028
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

671
01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:23.160
Hey, Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

672
01:00:23.369 --> 01:00:26.205
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

673
01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:30.709
- No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.

674
01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:33.694
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
I like to earn what I get.

675
01:00:33.718 --> 01:00:35.171
I can find find my own work.

676
01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:37.007
I respect that.

677
01:00:37.716 --> 01:00:39.843
You want to make it
on your own steam.

678
01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:41.845
That's great.

679
01:00:42.721 --> 01:00:45.056
What other skills do you have, Parker?

680
01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:47.893
I was thinking of something
in photography.

681
01:00:50.354 --> 01:00:51.605
Hello.

682
01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:55.817
Let's go! Move it!

683
01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.654
Watch the street!

684
01:01:00.906 --> 01:01:01.907
Whoo!

685
01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:07.287
Whoa!

686
01:01:14.086 --> 01:01:15.545
Cheese!

687
01:01:24.388 --> 01:01:25.680
They're crap.

688
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:28.851
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

689
01:01:29.059 --> 01:01:30.618
I'll give you $200 for all of them.

690
01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:33.313
- That seems a little low.
- Take them somewhere else, then.

691
01:01:34.648 --> 01:01:37.043
<i>Sir, your wife says the tile you ordered
for the foyer is out of stock.</i>

692
01:01:37.067 --> 01:01:38.693
Tell her we'll put a rug there.

693
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:41.029
Sit down. Give me that.

694
01:01:42.615 --> 01:01:45.159
Give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

695
01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:47.661
- Tear up page one. Run that photo instead.
- Headline?

696
01:01:47.953 --> 01:01:51.247
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive <i>Daily Bugle</i> Photos."

697
01:01:51.415 --> 01:01:53.166
Menace? He was protecting
that armored--

698
01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:56.134
I'll tell you what, Atticus. You take
the pictures, I'll make up the headlines.

699
01:01:56.295 --> 01:01:57.337
Okay? Alright? That okay with you?

700
01:01:57.504 --> 01:01:59.506
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

701
01:01:59.965 --> 01:02:03.468
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

702
01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:06.721
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

703
01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:08.557
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

704
01:02:08.766 --> 01:02:11.268
You bring me more shots
of that newspaper-selling clown

705
01:02:11.435 --> 01:02:13.270
maybe I'll take them off your hands.

706
01:02:13.437 --> 01:02:16.231
But I never said you have a job.
Meat.

707
01:02:16.398 --> 01:02:18.525
I'll send you a nice box of Christmas meat.
Best I can do.

708
01:02:18.692 --> 01:02:20.694
Get out of here. Bring me more photos.

709
01:02:22.279 --> 01:02:23.488
- Hi.
- Hi.

710
01:02:23.697 --> 01:02:26.658
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

711
01:02:26.825 --> 01:02:31.325
- Ah. Welcome to the <i>Daily Bugle.</i>
- Thank you.

712
01:02:31.872 --> 01:02:33.248
I'm Peter Parker.

713
01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.919
I'm a photographer.

714
01:02:38.712 --> 01:02:41.256
Yes. I can see that.

715
01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:53.473
As of today, OSCORP Industries
has surpassed Quest Aerospace

716
01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:59.650
as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

717
01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:02.653
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board

718
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.989
costs are down, revenues are up

719
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.076
and our stock
has never been higher.

720
01:03:09.243 --> 01:03:11.370
Wonderful news, Norman. Wonderful.

721
01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:14.581
As a matter of fact, it's the reason
we're selling the company.

722
01:03:14.748 --> 01:03:15.749
What?

723
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:20.458
Yes. Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing in
the wake of the bombing. Expanding.

724
01:03:21.338 --> 01:03:24.090
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

725
01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:25.425
Why wasn't I told?

726
01:03:25.592 --> 01:03:29.679
The last thing they want is a power
struggle with entrenched management.

727
01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.265
The deal is off if you come with it.

728
01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:35.853
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

729
01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:38.021
You can't do this to me.

730
01:03:41.191 --> 01:03:43.484
I started this company.

731
01:03:44.528 --> 01:03:46.947
You know how much I sacrificed?!

732
01:03:50.784 --> 01:03:55.284
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

733
01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:00.794
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

734
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:02.462
I'm sorry.

735
01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:05.591
You're out, Norman.

736
01:04:15.476 --> 01:04:16.977
Am I?

737
01:04:21.065 --> 01:04:24.109

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.402
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

758
01:05:49.486 --> 01:05:52.030
- Have you seen my father around?
- Uh...

01:05:52.197 --> 01:05:54.657
...well, I'm not sure if he's, uh,
coming today.

760
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:09.172
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

761
01:06:14.052 --> 01:06:15.303
What is that?

762
01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.555
That's our glider!

763
01:06:27.816 --> 01:06:29.275
What the hell was that?

764
01:06:57.679 --> 01:06:59.097
Code three!

765
01:07:15.113 --> 01:07:17.281
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

766
01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:26.708
Harry! Help me! Harry!

767
01:07:32.172 --> 01:07:34.424
Out, am I?

768
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:41.056
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

769
01:07:44.184 --> 01:07:46.895
- Hello, my dear.
- Aah!

770
01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:49.272
- It's Spider-Man!
- Huh?

771
01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.369
- Come on, move, kid.
- Come on, Billy!

772
01:08:05.872 --> 01:08:08.875
Somebody help him! No!

773
01:08:11.461 --> 01:08:13.004
Mommy!

774
01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:16.967
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

775
01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:20.053
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

776
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:27.102
Impressive.

777
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.236
Ah...

778
01:08:51.376 --> 01:08:54.837
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

779
01:09:20.197 --> 01:09:21.239
Hold on!

780
01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:23.909
Watch out!

781
01:09:33.043 --> 01:09:36.838
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

782
01:09:38.423 --> 01:09:40.341
Hold on, Mary Jane!

783
01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:25.011
Whoo! Well, beats taking
the subway.

784
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.431
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

785
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.766
Wait.

786
01:10:29.933 --> 01:10:31.184
Who are you?

787
01:10:31.351 --> 01:10:33.936
- You know who I am.
- I do?

788
01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:36.148
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

789
01:10:42.654 --> 01:10:44.989
Whoo-hoo!

790
01:10:48.493 --> 01:10:52.371
Incredible?
What do you mean, he's incredible?

791
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:57.210
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm gonna come over.

792
01:10:57.878 --> 01:10:59.546
No, I'm gonna come--

793
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.300
All right. Fine. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

794
01:11:03.508 --> 01:11:06.469
And we'll go and have breakfast
and, um...

795
01:11:06.636 --> 01:11:08.929
I wanna buy you something.

796
01:11:09.097 --> 01:11:12.433
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

797
01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:17.147
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

798
01:11:19.983 --> 01:11:22.360
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

799
01:11:22.527 --> 01:11:23.778
Don't let the bedbugs--

800
01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.996
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

801
01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:34.497
Yeah.

802
01:11:34.706 --> 01:11:38.334
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

803
01:11:39.711 --> 01:11:42.338
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

804
01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:45.550
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

805
01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.136
You're right.

806
01:11:49.054 --> 01:11:50.555
I didn't.

807
01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:56.978
I'm gonna get some rest.

808
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.482
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

809
01:12:01.566 --> 01:12:03.317
What was that thing?

810
01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:08.402
I don't know. Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

811
01:12:25.924 --> 01:12:27.592
Somebody there?

812
01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:29.886
<i>Somebody.</i>

813
01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:32.764
Who said that?

814
01:12:33.431 --> 01:12:36.767
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

815
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:41.898
<i>You've known all along.</i>

816
01:12:45.902 --> 01:12:47.278
Where are you?

817
01:12:47.445 --> 01:12:51.574
<i>Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.</i>

818
01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:00.208
<i>I'm right here.</i>

819
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.962
I don't understand.

820
01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:08.132
Did you think it was coincidence?

821
01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:11.928
So many good things,
all happening for you.

822
01:13:12.095 --> 01:13:15.765
All for you. Norman.

823
01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:19.727
What do you want'?

824
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:22.313
To say what you won't.

825
01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:25.150
To do what you can't.

826
01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:29.817
To remove those in your way.

827
01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:35.827
The board members.

828
01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.496
You killed them.

829
01:13:38.663 --> 01:13:40.289
We killed them.

830
01:13:40.624 --> 01:13:41.625
We?

831
01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:43.334
Remember?

832
01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:46.170
Your little accident in the laboratory.

833
01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:49.799
The performance enhancers.

834
01:13:49.966 --> 01:13:54.466
Bingo. Me.
Your greatest creation.

835
01:13:55.513 --> 01:13:59.308
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

836
01:13:59.476 --> 01:14:02.353
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

837
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.022
And it's only the beginning.

838
01:14:06.524 --> 01:14:10.861
There's only one who can stop us.

839
01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:15.158
Or imagine if he joined us.

840
01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:23.041
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

841
01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:26.544
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

842
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:28.337
These weirdos
all gotta have a name now.

843
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:29.745
-Mr. Jameson, Spider--
-Hoffman!

844
01:14:29.881 --> 01:14:30.882
Yeah?

845
01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:34.862
Call the patent office.
Copyright the name "Green Goblin."

846
01:14:34.886 --> 01:14:37.805
- I want a quarter every time it's said.
- How about "Green Meanie"?

847
01:14:39.182 --> 01:14:42.161
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
He was trying to save it. That's slander.

848
01:14:42.185 --> 01:14:44.562
It is not. I resent that.

849
01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:47.565
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

850
01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:49.534
You don't trust anybody.
That's your problem.

851
01:14:49.859 --> 01:14:51.610
I trust my barber.

852
01:14:52.362 --> 01:14:54.002
What are you, his lawyer?
Get out of here.

853
01:14:54.155 --> 01:14:56.282
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

854
01:14:56.449 --> 01:14:58.200
That's what made this country--

855
01:15:06.418 --> 01:15:09.546
Jameson, you slime.

856
01:15:09.754 --> 01:15:13.048
Who's the photographer who takes
the pictures of Spider-Man?

857
01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:15.093
I don't know who he is,
his stuff comes in the mail.

858
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.178
- You're lying!
- I swear.

859
01:15:17.345 --> 01:15:19.347
He's the one
who can bring me to him.

860
01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:22.433
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

861
01:15:22.642 --> 01:15:24.894
Set him down, tough guy.

862
01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:26.563
Speak of the devil.

863
01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:29.149
Spider-Man. I knew you two
were in this together!

864
01:15:29.607 --> 01:15:32.526
Hey, kiddo, let Mom
and Dad talk for a minute, will you?

865
01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:35.196
Sleep.

866
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:53.673
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

867
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:57.144
No, you're not dead.

868
01:15:57.168 --> 01:15:58.261
Yet.

869
01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.638
Just paralyzed...

870
01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:02.765
...temporarily.

871
01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:06.853
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

872
01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:09.731
You and I are not so different.

873
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.776
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

874
01:16:13.985 --> 01:16:16.862
Well, to each his own.

875
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:19.991
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

876
01:16:20.658 --> 01:16:25.158
And they found you amusing for a while,
the people of this city.

877
01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:28.750
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

878
01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:32.544
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

879
01:16:32.712 --> 01:16:37.212
In spite of everything you've done
for them, eventually, they will hate you.

880
01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:38.510
Why bother?

881
01:16:38.718 --> 01:16:43.218
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

882
01:16:43.848 --> 01:16:46.851
There are eight million people
in this city.

883
01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:51.355
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

884
01:16:51.564 --> 01:16:55.526
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

885
01:16:55.693 --> 01:16:57.111
You, me...

886
01:16:57.695 --> 01:16:59.613
...we're exceptional.

887
01:16:59.864 --> 01:17:04.364
I could squash you
like a bug right now.

888
01:17:04.744 --> 01:17:08.372
But I'm offering you a choice. Join me.

889
01:17:08.581 --> 01:17:12.167
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

890
01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:15.129
What we could create.

891
01:17:15.713 --> 01:17:17.715
Or we could destroy.

892
01:17:17.882 --> 01:17:21.844
Cause the deaths of countless innocents
in selfish battle...

893
01:17:22.053 --> 01:17:24.472
...again and again and again
until we're both dead.

894
01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:26.932
Is that what you want?

895
01:17:28.935 --> 01:17:31.812
Think about it, hero.

896
01:17:43.783 --> 01:17:46.452
<i>In spite of everything
you've done for them...</i>

897
01:17:46.619 --> 01:17:49.121
<i>...eventually, they will hate you.</i>

898
01:17:58.256 --> 01:17:59.257
Hey!

899
01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:01.134
- It's me again.
- Hey.

900
01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:02.719
How was your audition?

901
01:18:02.927 --> 01:18:05.930
- How'd you know?
- The hotline. Your mom...

902
01:18:06.097 --> 01:18:08.057
...told my aunt, told me.

903
01:18:08.516 --> 01:18:09.850
So you just came by?

904
01:18:10.059 --> 01:18:13.687
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

905
01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:17.567
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

906
01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:21.278
- So how'd it go?
- Oh...

907
01:18:22.363 --> 01:18:24.406
They said I needed acting lessons.

908
01:18:25.116 --> 01:18:28.869
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

909
01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:33.537
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

910
01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.795
I'd like a cheeseburger.

911
01:18:38.254 --> 01:18:41.715
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

912
01:18:42.133 --> 01:18:43.551
Come with us.

913
01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:46.470
No, thanks. How's it going with--?

914
01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:50.891
Uh... Never mind.
That's none of my business.

915
01:18:51.392 --> 01:18:52.893
It's not?

916
01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:55.980
Why so interested?

917
01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.149
I'm not.

918
01:18:58.399 --> 01:18:59.775
You're not?

919
01:19:01.402 --> 01:19:04.154
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

920
01:19:04.405 --> 01:19:06.198
Why would you be?

921
01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.411
I, uh... That's a--

922
01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.121
I don't know.

923
01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:17.168
Sorry you won't come with us.

924
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:21.589
I better run, tiger.

925
01:19:30.306 --> 01:19:32.308
Hey, check it out, man.

926
01:19:32.475 --> 01:19:34.143
Come on, man.

927
01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:40.942
Hey, where you going,
baby? Come on!

928
01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:00.253
Get off me!

929
01:20:01.254 --> 01:20:02.672
Hey.

930
01:20:03.548 --> 01:20:05.091
- Hey.
- Aah. Aah.

931
01:20:33.578 --> 01:20:35.079
Wait!

932
01:20:39.917 --> 01:20:42.294
- You have a knack for getting in trouble.
- Ha, ha.

933
01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:46.841
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

934
01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:48.926
I was in the neighborhood.

935
01:20:50.803 --> 01:20:53.430
You are amazing.

936
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:57.101
Some people don't think so.

937
01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:01.189
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

938
01:21:01.939 --> 01:21:05.150
Do I get to say thank you this time?

939
01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.528
Wait.

940
01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:18.982
Let me in! My baby's in there!
My baby's in there! Let me go!

941
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:21.035
I can't let you in there,
the roof's about to collapse!

942
01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:24.605
I can't let you in there the roof's about to collapse!

943
01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:26.148
Look! Up there!

944
01:22:32.822 --> 01:22:34.615
Save my baby, please!

945
01:22:58.306 --> 01:22:59.473
No!

946
01:23:04.562 --> 01:23:05.646
No.

947
01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:10.443
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby.

948
01:23:12.236 --> 01:23:15.155
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

949
01:23:15.406 --> 01:23:17.116
Don't let him get away!

950
01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:20.494
Hold it! Hold it right there.
You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.

951
01:23:20.703 --> 01:23:22.496
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

952
01:23:25.249 --> 01:23:26.250
I'm going.

953
01:23:28.544 --> 01:23:31.588
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back, chief.

954
01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:33.132
Go! GO!

955
01:23:42.058 --> 01:23:43.768
Where are you?

956
01:23:45.811 --> 01:23:47.395
Where are you?

957
01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:55.154
I'm gonna get you out of here!

958
01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.241
It's okay.

959
01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:08.875
You're pathetically predictable.

960
01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.961
Like a moth to the flame.

961
01:24:11.837 --> 01:24:14.297
What about my generous proposal?

962
01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:18.177
Are you in or are you out?

963
01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:20.971
It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind.

964
01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:23.391
Wrong answer.

965
01:24:24.725 --> 01:24:26.226
Oh, great.

966
01:25:04.890 --> 01:25:07.684
No one says no to me!

967
01:25:15.026 --> 01:25:18.446
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

968
01:25:20.948 --> 01:25:22.199
He's here.

969
01:25:23.534 --> 01:25:25.619
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

970
01:25:26.329 --> 01:25:28.998
Hi, Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

971
01:25:29.206 --> 01:25:32.292
Work was murder. I picked up a fruitcake.

972
01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:34.541
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

973
01:25:34.587 --> 01:25:35.921
- You look great.
- Thanks.

974
01:25:36.172 --> 01:25:38.883
Who is this lovely young lady?

975
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:41.135
M.J., I'd like you to meet my father,
Norman Osborn.

976
01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:42.720
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

977
01:25:42.887 --> 01:25:44.179
- Hi.
- How do you do?

978
01:25:44.347 --> 01:25:46.223
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

979
01:25:46.432 --> 01:25:50.144
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

980
01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.688
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

981
01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:02.031
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

982
01:26:05.034 --> 01:26:06.535
Peter?

983
01:26:11.248 --> 01:26:12.832
Peter?

984
01:26:14.585 --> 01:26:16.295
Is that you?

985
01:26:19.757 --> 01:26:21.592
Pete?

986
01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:25.929
How strange. There's nobody here.

987
01:26:32.395 --> 01:26:36.895
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

988
01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:48.410
Huh.

989
01:27:09.473 --> 01:27:12.100
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter.

990
01:27:12.268 --> 01:27:14.103
Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.

991
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:16.939
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

992
01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:21.402
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

993
01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:23.153
...and we can say grace.

994
01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:26.323
Parker.

995
01:27:26.699 --> 01:27:28.450
Here we go.

996
01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.751
- There we are.
- Oh, it looks delicious.

997
01:27:38.252 --> 01:27:39.753
Norman.

998
01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:43.840
Will you do the honors?

999
01:27:55.519 --> 01:27:58.772
- Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
- Hm?

1000
01:28:00.524 --> 01:28:02.359
Oh, uh, yeah.

1001
01:28:02.526 --> 01:28:06.947
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

1002
01:28:07.114 --> 01:28:08.657
Well, let me see.

1003
01:28:08.866 --> 01:28:10.450
Oh, my goodness.

1004
01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:13.037
- Oh, that looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

1005
01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:16.332
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

1006
01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:19.459
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
in this apartment...

1007
01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.837
...and we are gonna do things properly.

1008
01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:25.883
How did you say that happened?

1009
01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.010
Bike messenger.

1010
01:28:28.219 --> 01:28:30.179
Knocked me down.

1011
01:28:33.933 --> 01:28:35.309
Uh...

1012
01:28:35.559 --> 01:28:38.331
If you'll excuse me,
I've got to be going.

1013
01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:39.371
Wh... Why?

1014
01:28:40.147 --> 01:28:43.525
Something has come to my attention.

1015
01:28:43.734 --> 01:28:44.985
Are you all right?

1016
01:28:45.194 --> 01:28:48.697
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

1017
01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:51.700
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad.

1018
01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:55.037
Dad, what are you doing?

1019
01:28:55.204 --> 01:28:57.664
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

1020
01:28:57.873 --> 01:28:59.583
I gotta go.

1021
01:28:59.875 --> 01:29:04.004
- Dad, this girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

1022
01:29:04.213 --> 01:29:06.465
You think a woman like that
is sniffing around

1023
01:29:06.632 --> 01:29:08.175
because she likes
your personality?

1024
01:29:08.425 --> 01:29:11.428
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.

1025
01:29:11.595 --> 01:29:12.762
They're all beautiful.

1026
01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:17.017
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

1027
01:29:17.226 --> 01:29:18.477
You're wrong about her, Dad.

1028
01:29:19.019 --> 01:29:22.188
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

1029
01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:25.067
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

1030
01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:39.206
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

1031
01:29:39.415 --> 01:29:42.376
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

1032
01:29:42.585 --> 01:29:46.463
That creep is my father, all right? If
I'm lucky, I'll become half of what he is.

1033
01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:49.070
So just keep your mouth shut about stuff
you don't understand!

1034
01:29:49.216 --> 01:29:50.884
Harry Osborn.

1035
01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:54.012
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1036
01:29:56.974 --> 01:30:00.310
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

1037
01:30:00.477 --> 01:30:03.646
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

1038
01:30:03.814 --> 01:30:05.148
I can't.

1039
01:30:05.316 --> 01:30:08.319
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

1040
01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:10.821
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

1041
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.282
What do I do?

1042
01:30:14.491 --> 01:30:18.578
<i>Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.</i>

1043
01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:21.790
<i>Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.</i>

1044
01:30:22.041 --> 01:30:23.333
Yes?

1045
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.418
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

1046
01:30:26.337 --> 01:30:27.629
But how?

1047
01:30:27.838 --> 01:30:32.133
<i>The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

1048
01:30:32.343 --> 01:30:33.510
Tell me how!

1049
01:30:33.677 --> 01:30:35.845
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

1050
01:30:36.096 --> 01:30:39.140
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

1051
01:30:41.018 --> 01:30:44.521
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

1052
01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:47.691
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1053
01:30:47.983 --> 01:30:50.944
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us--

1054
01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:53.030
Oh!

1055
01:30:59.536 --> 01:31:02.080
Deliver us!

1056
01:31:02.289 --> 01:31:03.665
Finish it!

1057
01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:07.878
- Finish it!
- From evil!

1058
01:31:13.592 --> 01:31:15.552
Two milligrams IV.

1059
01:31:17.554 --> 01:31:18.805
Get the BP.

1060
01:31:19.223 --> 01:31:22.809
Aunt May.
Is she gonna be okay? What happened?

1061
01:31:23.018 --> 01:31:24.352
Look, you have to leave.

1062
01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.230
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

1063
01:31:26.438 --> 01:31:29.566
Those horrible yellow eyes!

1064
01:31:35.322 --> 01:31:37.866
He knows who I am.

1065
01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:23.411
I'm sorry.

1066
01:32:27.124 --> 01:32:29.584
- Will she be okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

1067
01:32:29.752 --> 01:32:32.421
She's been sleeping all day.

1068
01:32:33.422 --> 01:32:36.174
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1069
01:32:40.345 --> 01:32:43.264
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

1070
01:32:43.432 --> 01:32:47.102
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

1071
01:32:47.352 --> 01:32:50.313
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

1072
01:32:50.773 --> 01:32:52.941
I haven't called him back.

1073
01:32:55.027 --> 01:32:56.737
The fact is...

1074
01:32:57.905 --> 01:33:00.741
- ...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

1075
01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:02.117
At least I think I am.

1076
01:33:04.787 --> 01:33:07.831
- It's not the right time to talk about it.
- No, no. Go on.

1077
01:33:07.998 --> 01:33:11.251
Would I know his name, this guy?

1078
01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.795
You'll think I'm a stupid little girl
with a crush.

1079
01:33:14.505 --> 01:33:15.881
Trust me.

1080
01:33:16.131 --> 01:33:17.382
It's funny.

1081
01:33:19.384 --> 01:33:22.762
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

1082
01:33:23.514 --> 01:33:26.892
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

1083
01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.062
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

1084
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:33.070
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say about him?

1085
01:33:33.232 --> 01:33:37.653
No, no. Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

1086
01:33:37.861 --> 01:33:39.487
I know him a little bit.

1087
01:33:39.696 --> 01:33:42.573
I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.

1088
01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:45.911
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

1089
01:33:46.245 --> 01:33:47.496
What'd he say'?

1090
01:33:47.663 --> 01:33:49.623
Uh... I said...

1091
01:33:50.707 --> 01:33:55.002
He asked me
what I thought about you.

1092
01:33:55.921 --> 01:33:57.964
And what did you say?

1093
01:33:58.674 --> 01:34:02.761
I said, um, "Spider-Man"...

1094
01:34:03.095 --> 01:34:07.595
...I said, um,
"The great thing about M.J...

1095
01:34:08.183 --> 01:34:09.726
...is...

1096
01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:13.897
...when you look in her eyes...

1097
01:34:16.441 --> 01:34:19.652
...and she's looking back in yours...

1098
01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:23.657
...everything feels...

1099
01:34:24.867 --> 01:34:26.702
...not quite normal.

1100
01:34:27.953 --> 01:34:29.746
Because you feel...

1101
01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:31.915
...stronger...

1102
01:34:33.458 --> 01:34:37.086
...and weaker at the same time.

1103
01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:40.257
You feel excited...

1104
01:34:41.133 --> 01:34:43.176
...and at the same time...

1105
01:34:43.802 --> 01:34:45.428
...terrified.

1106
01:34:47.764 --> 01:34:52.059
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

1107
01:34:53.478 --> 01:34:57.106
...except you know
what kind of man you want to be.

1108
01:34:59.818 --> 01:35:01.694
It's as if you've...

1109
01:35:02.321 --> 01:35:05.490
...reached the unreachable...

1110
01:35:07.075 --> 01:35:09.786
...and you weren't ready for it."

1111
01:35:13.248 --> 01:35:14.999
You said that?

1112
01:35:15.792 --> 01:35:18.336
Well, something like that.

1113
01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:49.784
Hey-

1114
01:36:02.422 --> 01:36:03.923
Dad?

1115
01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:11.348
Dad, is that you?

1116
01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.439
What is it?

1117
01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:24.986
Well, you were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1118
01:36:27.698 --> 01:36:30.409
She's in love with Peter.

1119
01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:32.494
- Parker?
- Yeah.

1120
01:36:32.661 --> 01:36:34.621
And how does he feel about her?

1121
01:36:37.207 --> 01:36:39.751
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1122
01:36:40.711 --> 01:36:45.211
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1123
01:36:47.592 --> 01:36:50.636
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1124
01:36:53.098 --> 01:36:55.016
I haven't always been there
for you, have I?

1125
01:36:58.312 --> 01:37:01.523
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1126
01:37:01.732 --> 01:37:03.525
That's no excuse.

1127
01:37:04.526 --> 01:37:06.319
I'm proud of you.

1128
01:37:06.862 --> 01:37:11.362
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.

1129
01:37:11.908 --> 01:37:15.244
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

1130
01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:31.094
Wake up, little spider.

1131
01:37:31.261 --> 01:37:32.762
Wake up.

1132
01:37:34.097 --> 01:37:35.681
Go home, dear.

1133
01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:37.225
You look awful.

1134
01:37:37.434 --> 01:37:39.686
- And you look beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

1135
01:37:39.895 --> 01:37:43.231
- I don't like to leave you here.
- Oh, but I'm safe here.

1136
01:37:43.398 --> 01:37:46.109
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1137
01:37:46.276 --> 01:37:50.238
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1138
01:37:52.574 --> 01:37:54.325
A smile. Finally.

1139
01:37:54.493 --> 01:37:57.746
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1140
01:37:57.913 --> 01:38:00.457
Hey. You were supposed
to be asleep.

1141
01:38:02.084 --> 01:38:06.584
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1142
01:38:07.089 --> 01:38:11.051
And when she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1143
01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:15.718
...you grabbed me and said, "Aunt May.
Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1144
01:38:17.766 --> 01:38:21.311
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1145
01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:26.732
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1146
01:38:26.942 --> 01:38:30.695
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1147
01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:35.404
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1148
01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:38.828
You're so mysterious all the time.

1149
01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:41.831
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1150
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.210
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care? Heh.

1151
01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.922
Everybody else knows.

1152
01:38:51.967 --> 01:38:53.134
I'll be right back.

1153
01:38:53.885 --> 01:38:55.386
But--

1154
01:39:02.519 --> 01:39:04.521
Come on, pick up.

1155
01:39:04.688 --> 01:39:05.689
<i>Hey, ma.-</i>

1156
01:39:05.856 --> 01:39:07.691
Sing your song at the <i>beep.</i>

1157
01:39:09.025 --> 01:39:11.068
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1158
01:39:11.361 --> 01:39:14.197
Hello? You there?

1159
01:39:14.698 --> 01:39:19.198
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in, okay?

1160
01:39:19.369 --> 01:39:20.787
All right, well...

1161
01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:22.246
...don't--

1162
01:39:23.039 --> 01:39:26.250
Don't go up any dark alleys.
Hello?

1163
01:39:29.379 --> 01:39:33.091
<i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>

1164
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.051
Where is she?

1165
01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.263
Ah...

1166
01:40:21.306 --> 01:40:22.974
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1167
01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:27.228

1169
01:40:48.959 --> 01:40:50.669
Goblin, what have you done?

1170
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:37.006
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1171
01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:39.008
Because you never know...

1172
01:41:39.217 --> 01:41:43.596
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1173
01:41:45.098 --> 01:41:46.849
Let die the woman you love...

1174
01:41:52.063 --> 01:41:56.563
...or suffer the little children.

1175
01:41:59.529 --> 01:42:01.989
- Spider-Man!
- Save us!

1176
01:42:02.532 --> 01:42:04.784
Save us!

1177
01:42:05.035 --> 01:42:07.620
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1178
01:42:07.829 --> 01:42:11.207
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1179
01:42:11.374 --> 01:42:13.459
Don't do it, Goblin!

1180
01:42:13.627 --> 01:42:16.546
We are who we choose to be.

1181
01:42:16.796 --> 01:42:18.714
- Now, choose!
- No!

1182
01:42:48.244 --> 01:42:49.828
Everybody stay still!

1183
01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:00.673
Ahoy up there!

1184
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.759
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1185
01:43:11.267 --> 01:43:15.396
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1186
01:43:15.563 --> 01:43:17.064
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1187
01:43:22.153 --> 01:43:25.197
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1188
01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:26.949
Trust me.

1189
01:43:28.451 --> 01:43:31.120
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1190
01:43:36.626 --> 01:43:38.669
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1191
01:43:38.878 --> 01:43:40.546
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1192
01:44:08.992 --> 01:44:11.619
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1193
01:44:21.504 --> 01:44:23.547
It's time to die.

1194
01:44:31.723 --> 01:44:34.183
Come on up here, tough guy,
I got something for you!

1195
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:35.559
Yeah, kick your ass!

1196
01:44:35.769 --> 01:44:39.147
Leave Spider-Man alone! You'll pick
on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?

1197
01:44:39.814 --> 01:44:41.273
I got something for your ass!

1198
01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.317
Mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1199
01:44:43.485 --> 01:44:45.904
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1200
01:44:52.035 --> 01:44:53.453
Yeah!

1201
01:44:59.542 --> 01:45:01.335
Spider-Man, watch out!

1202
01:45:33.201 --> 01:45:37.455
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1203
01:45:38.373 --> 01:45:41.000
I offered you friendship...

1204
01:45:41.167 --> 01:45:43.043
...and you spat in my face.

1205
01:46:34.137 --> 01:46:37.807
You've spun your last web,
Spider-Man.

1206
01:46:37.974 --> 01:46:41.310
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death...

1207
01:46:41.477 --> 01:46:43.187
...would have been quick
and painless.

1208
01:46:43.354 --> 01:46:46.732
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1209
01:46:46.983 --> 01:46:51.483
...I'm gonna finish her nice and slow.

1210
01:46:56.451 --> 01:46:58.494
M.J. and I...

1211
01:46:59.329 --> 01:47:02.623
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1212
01:47:56.427 --> 01:47:57.970
Peter, stop!

1213
01:47:58.137 --> 01:48:00.597
Stop! It's me.

1214
01:48:09.565 --> 01:48:10.983
Mr. Osborn.

1215
01:48:11.192 --> 01:48:12.776
Peter, thank God for you.

1216
01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:15.279
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1217
01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:18.532
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it.

1218
01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.451
Don't let him take me again.

1219
01:48:20.618 --> 01:48:22.661
I beg you. Protect me.

1220
01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:26.374
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1221
01:48:26.582 --> 01:48:28.083
But not you.

1222
01:48:28.751 --> 01:48:32.713
I tried to stop it. But I couldn't stop it.

1223
01:48:32.922 --> 01:48:35.007
I would never hurt you.

1224
01:48:35.216 --> 01:48:37.134
I knew from the beginning...

1225
01:48:37.343 --> 01:48:40.262
...if anything ever happened to me...

1226
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:42.598
...it was you that I could count on.

1227
01:48:42.765 --> 01:48:46.101
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1228
01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:48.521
Thank God for you.

1229
01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:50.940
Give me your hand.

1230
01:48:52.108 --> 01:48:55.528
Believe in me as I believed in you.

1231
01:48:56.946 --> 01:48:59.740
I've been like a father to you.

1232
01:49:01.284 --> 01:49:02.952
Be a son to me now.

1233
01:49:04.746 --> 01:49:06.622
I have a father.

1234
01:49:07.373 --> 01:49:09.875
His name was Ben Parker.

1235
01:49:11.753 --> 01:49:13.212
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1236
01:49:20.136 --> 01:49:21.387
Oh.

1237
01:49:32.148 --> 01:49:33.649
Peter.

1238
01:49:35.985 --> 01:49:37.277
Don't tell Harry.

1239
01:50:09.519 --> 01:50:11.229
What have you done?

1240
01:50:11.395 --> 01:50:12.979
What have you done?!

1241
01:50:36.254 --> 01:50:37.755
Hey-

1242
01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:43.177
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1243
01:50:44.095 --> 01:50:47.223
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1244
01:50:49.392 --> 01:50:52.686
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1245
01:50:54.272 --> 01:50:56.816
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1246
01:50:58.442 --> 01:51:01.570
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1247
01:51:06.659 --> 01:51:08.410
Thank God for you, Peter.

1248
01:51:08.995 --> 01:51:11.580
You're the only family I have.

1249
01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:38.399
No matter what I do...

1250
01:51:38.566 --> 01:51:41.694
<i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>

1251
01:51:42.069 --> 01:51:46.569
<i>...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.</i>

1252
01:51:56.834 --> 01:51:59.169
You must miss him so much.

1253
01:52:00.129 --> 01:52:03.173
It's been so hard without him.

1254
01:52:06.093 --> 01:52:08.970
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1255
01:52:10.765 --> 01:52:12.558
When I was up there...

1256
01:52:13.309 --> 01:52:16.103
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1257
01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:20.482
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1258
01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:26.071
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1259
01:52:27.531 --> 01:52:29.491
It was you, Pete.

1260
01:52:30.826 --> 01:52:32.702
I kept thinking:

1261
01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.914
"I hope I make it through this...

1262
01:52:37.375 --> 01:52:41.754
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1263
01:52:43.130 --> 01:52:44.631
Really?

1264
01:52:45.007 --> 01:52:49.507
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1265
01:52:52.056 --> 01:52:54.016
...who makes me feel...

1266
01:52:54.475 --> 01:52:58.187
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1267
01:53:00.314 --> 01:53:01.982
That I'm just...

1268
01:53:02.650 --> 01:53:04.151
...me.

1269
01:53:05.236 --> 01:53:07.154
And that's okay.

1270
01:53:09.323 --> 01:53:10.991
The truth is...

1271
01:53:12.827 --> 01:53:14.745
...I love you.

1272
01:53:16.831 --> 01:53:19.124
I love you so much, Peter.

1273
01:53:39.478 --> 01:53:43.978
<i>All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.</i>

1274
01:53:44.442 --> 01:53:46.360
I can't.

1275
01:53:48.487 --> 01:53:50.489
You can't what?

1276
01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:52.616
Tell you...

1277
01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:58.581
...everything. I mean,
there's so much to tell.

1278
01:53:59.749 --> 01:54:03.669
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1279
01:54:04.587 --> 01:54:06.589
I want you to know...

1280
01:54:06.964 --> 01:54:09.883
...that I will always be there
for you.

1281
01:54:10.051 --> 01:54:13.804
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1282
01:54:14.805 --> 01:54:16.807
I promise you that.

1283
01:54:20.102 --> 01:54:22.395
I will always be your friend.

1284
01:54:25.316 --> 01:54:27.192
Only a friend...

1285
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:29.904
...Peter Parker?

1286
01:54:31.781 --> 01:54:34.617
That's all I have to give.

1287
01:55:00.976 --> 01:55:03.645
<i>Whatever life holds in store for me...</i>

1288
01:55:03.813 --> 01:55:06.899
<i>...I will never forget these words:</i>

1289
01:55:07.066 --> 01:55:11.566
<i>"With great power
comes great responsibility."</i>

1290
01:55:12.113 --> 01:55:14.365

1291
01:55:14.532 --> 01:55:16.659
