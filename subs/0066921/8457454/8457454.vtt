00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.637
<i>There was me.</i>

2
00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.773
<i>That is, Alex,</i>
<i>and my three droogs.</i>

3
00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.675
<i>That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.</i>

4
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.644
<i>And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,</i>
<i>trying to make up our rassoodocks...</i>

5
00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.151
<i>... what to do with the evening.</i>

6
00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.952
<i>The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.</i>

7
00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:11.857
<i>Milk plus vellocet or</i>
<i>synthemesc or drencrom...</i>

8
00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.056
<i>... which is what we were drinking.</i>

9
00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.033
<i>This would sharpen you up...</i>

10
00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:20.195
<i>... and make you ready for a bit</i>
<i>of the old ultra-violence.</i>

11
00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:28.036
<i>In Dublin's fair city</i>

12
00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:32.845
<i>Where the girls are so pretty</i>

13
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.980
<i>I first set my eyes</i>

14
00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:41.652
<i>On sweet Molly Malone</i>

15
00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:47.426
<i>As she wheeled her wheelbarrow</i>

16
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.069
<i>Through streets broad and narrow</i>

17
00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:56.775
<i>Crying, "Cockles and mussels..."</i>

18
00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.837
<i>One thing I could never stand...</i>

19
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.446
<i>... was to see a filthy,</i>
<i>dirty old drunkie...</i>

20
00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.377
<i>... howling away at the</i>
<i>filthy songs of his fathers...</i>

21
00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.949
<i>... and going "blerp blerp"</i>
<i>in between...</i>

22
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:12.454
<i>... as it might be a filthy old</i>
<i>orchestra in his stinking guts.</i>

23
00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:16.354
<i>I could never stand to see anyone</i>
<i>like that, whatever his age.</i>

24
00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:19.726
<i>But more especially when he</i>
<i>was real old, like this one was.</i>

25
00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:31.400
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

26
00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:39.644
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.

27
00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.752
Not in a stinking world
like this.

28
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.654
And what's so stinking about it?

29
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:53.161
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

30
00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.493
It stinks because it lets
the young get onto the old...

31
00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.794
...like you done!

32
00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:03.906
It's no world
for an old man any longer.

33
00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.913
What kind of a world is it
at all?

34
00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.012
Men on the moon.

35
00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.807
Men spinning around the earth.

36
00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.079
And there's not no
attention paid...

37
00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.850
...to earthly
law and order no more.

38
00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:22.787
<i>Oh, dear land</i>

39
00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.494
<i>I fought for thee</i>

40
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.531
<i>It was at the derelict casino</i>
<i>that we came across Billy-boy...</i>

41
00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.829
<i>... and his four droogs.</i>

42
00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.573
<i>They were about to perform</i>
<i>a little of the old...</i>

43
00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:13.812
<i>... in-out, in-out on a weepy</i>
<i>young devotchka they had there.</i>

44
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.797
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...

45
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.366
...billy goat
Billy-boy in poison.

46
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.797
How are thou...

47
00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:17.907
...thou globby bottle of cheap,
stinking chip-oil?

48
00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:22.206
Come and get one in the yarbles...

49
00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:24.313
...if you have any yarbles...

50
00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:27.576
...you eunuch jelly, thou.

51
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.718
Let's get them, boys!

52
00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.182
The police!

53
00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.446
Come on. Let's go!

54
00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:59.970
<i>The Durango 95 purred away</i>
<i>real horrorshow.</i>

55
00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:04.411
<i>A nice, warm vibratey feeling</i>
<i>all through your guttiwuts.</i>

56
00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:07.847
<i>Soon it was trees and dark,</i>
<i>my brothers...</i>

57
00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:10.647
<i>... with real country dark.</i>

58
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.690
<i>We fillied around with other</i>
<i>travelers of the night...</i>

59
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.296
<i>... playing Hogs of the Road.</i>

60
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.524
<i>Then we headed west.</i>

61
00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:59.465
<i>What we were after now</i>
<i>was the old surprise visit.</i>

62
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.933
<i>That was a real kick...</i>

63
00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:05.644
<i>... and good for laughs and</i>
<i>lashing of the old ultra-violent.</i>

64
00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.084
Who on earth could that be?

65
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.763
I'll go and see.

66
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.177
Yes, who is it?

67
00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:23.445
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

68
00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:28.789
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?

69
00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:32.327
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

70
00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:35.227
But, missus, it's a matter
of life and death!

71
00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:36.798
Who is it, dear?

72
00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:39.630
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

73
00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.501
He wants to use the telephone.

74
00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.976
I suppose you better let him in.

75
00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:48.878
Wait a minute, will you?

76
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.315
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in...

77
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.264
What do you want from me?

78
00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:14.837
Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim...

79
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.909
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

80
00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.882
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

81
00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:27.549
<i>What a glorious feeling</i>

82
00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.911
<i>I'm happy again</i>

83
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.121
<i>I'm laughing at clouds</i>

84
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.625
<i>So dark up above</i>

85
00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.621
<i>The sun's in my heart</i>

86
00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.896
<i>And I'm ready for love</i>

87
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.766
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

88
00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.573
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

89
00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:52.240
<i>Come on with the rain</i>

90
00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.305
<i>I've a smile on my face</i>

91
00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.374
<i>I'll walk down the lane</i>

92
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:01.319
<i>With a happy refrain</i>

93
00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:04.286
<i>And I'm singing</i>

94
00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:06.390
<i>Just singing...</i>

95
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.721
<i>... in the rain</i>

96
00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:17.962
Viddy well, little brother.

97
00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.858
Viddy well.

98
00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:44.053
<i>We were all feeling a bit</i>
<i>shagged and fagged and fashed...</i>

99
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:48.885
<i>... it having been an evening</i>
<i>of some small energy expenditure.</i>

100
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:54.098
<i>So we got rid of the auto and</i>
<i>stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.</i>

101
00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:01.929
Hello, Lucy.

102
00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.737
Had a busy night?

103
00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:08.845
We've been working hard too.

104
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.081
Pardon me, Luce.

105
00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:24.253
<i>There was some sophistos from</i>
<i>the TVstudios around the corner...</i>

106
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.725
<i>... laughing and govoreeting.</i>

107
00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:32.129
<i>The devotchka smeched away, not</i>
<i>caring about the wicked world one bit.</i>

108
00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:36.371
<i>Then the disk on the stereo</i>
<i>twanged off and out.</i>

109
00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.908
<i>And in the short silence</i>
<i>before the next one came on...</i>

110
00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:43.308
<i>... she suddenly came</i>
<i>with a burst of singing.</i>

111
00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:49.484
<i>And it was like, for a moment,</i>
<i>O my brothers...</i>

112
00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:53.053
<i>... some great bird</i>
<i>had flown into the milk bar.</i>

113
00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:56.490
<i>And I felt all the malenky</i>
<i>little hairs on my plott...</i>

114
00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:58.627
<i>... standing endwise.</i>

115
00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:03.125
<i>And the shivers crawling up</i>
<i>like slow, malenky lizards...</i>

116
00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.960
<i>... and then down again.</i>

117
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.933
<i>Because I knew what she sang.</i>

118
00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:11.574
<i>It was a bit from</i>
<i>the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.</i>

119
00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.512
What did you do that for?

120
00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.813
For being a bastard
with no manners.

121
00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:29.925
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise.

122
00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:34.995
I don't like you should
do what you done.

123
00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:38.868
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

124
00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:43.706
Watch that.

125
00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:49.808
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on live thou dost wish.

126
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.046
Yarbles!

127
00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:56.015
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

128
00:15:56.488 --> 00:16:00.151
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

129
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:03.053
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

130
00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:06.396
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

131
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.537
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

132
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.150
Doobidoob.

133
00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:35.360
A bit tired maybe.

134
00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.329
Best not to say more.

135
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.157
Bedways is rightways now.

136
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.763
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

137
00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:48.539
Right, right?

138
00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.449
<i>Where I lived was with</i>
<i>my dada and mum...</i>

139
00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:08.125
<i>... in municipal flat block</i>
<i>18-A, Linear North.</i>

140
00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:35.947
<i>It had been a wonderful evening.</i>

141
00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:39.673
<i>And what I needed now</i>
<i>to give it the perfect ending...</i>

142
00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.886
<i>... was a bit</i>
<i>of the old Ludwig van.</i>

143
00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.336
<i>Oh, bliss!</i>

144
00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:37.000
<i>Bliss and heaven!</i>

145
00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:42.071
<i>It was gorgeousness and</i>
<i>gorgeosity made flesh.</i>

146
00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:46.942
<i>It was like a bird</i>
<i>of rarest spun heaven metal.</i>

147
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:50.622
<i>Or like silvery wine</i>
<i>flowing in a spaceship...</i>

148
00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:53.687
<i>... gravity all nonsense now.</i>

149
00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:55.625
<i>As I slooshied...</i>

150
00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:58.920
<i>... I knew such lovely pictures.</i>

151
00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:19.941
Alex. Alex!

152
00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:28.615
What do you want?

153
00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.385
It's past eight, Alex.

154
00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:33.722
You don't want to be
late for school, son.

155
00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:37.795
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

156
00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.594
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

157
00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:43.603
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

158
00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:47.636
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

159
00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.073
Got to rest, Mum.

160
00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:51.445
Got to get fit.

161
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.342
Otherwise, I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

162
00:20:55.621 --> 00:21:00.752
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.

163
00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:06.025
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

164
00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:13.497
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

165
00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.605
Yes. Yes, I heard.

166
00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.531
You know what time he got in?

167
00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:20.801
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

168
00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:24.972
I wonder...

169
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.377
...where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

170
00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.989
Like he says...

171
00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.557
...it's mostly odd things he does.

172
00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:36.987
Helping-like...

173
00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:39.891
...here and there, as it might be.

174
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.531
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

175
00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.709
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

176
00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:29.880
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?

177
00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:33.541
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

178
00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.776
She gave me the key.

179
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.854
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

180
00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:44.028
Hence, not at school, yes?

181
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:47.526
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

182
00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:49.893
It should be clear
by this afterlunch.

183
00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.363
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

184
00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:56.869
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

185
00:22:57.075 --> 00:23:00.602
- Cup of the old chai, sir?
- No time, no time.

186
00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:02.436
Sit, sit, sit!

187
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.813
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

188
00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:08.712
Anything wrong, sir?

189
00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:12.788
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

190
00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:15.458
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

191
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.957
Just a manner of speech.

192
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:20.255
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your...

193
00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:23.798
...post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, little Alex.

194
00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:27.563
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective school.

195
00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:32.140
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

196
00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:34.175
If you've no respect
for yourself...

197
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:37.507
...you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

198
00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:41.810
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

199
00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:45.284
A confession of failure
for every one of you...

200
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.457
...who ends up in the stripy hole.

201
00:23:48.693 --> 00:23:50.524
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

202
00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:53.423
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

203
00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:54.996
Sir, I mean.

204
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.758
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

205
00:23:58.003 --> 00:24:00.267
Just because the police
haven't picked you up...

206
00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:03.669
...doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

207
00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:09.039
There was a bit of nastiness last night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

208
00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:13.512
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

209
00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:15.150
Your name was mentioned.

210
00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:17.617
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

211
00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:20.689
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

212
00:24:20.992 --> 00:24:24.189
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

213
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:25.987
I'm warning you, little Alex...

214
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.528
...being a good friend
to you as always...

215
00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:31.531
...the one man in this
sore and sick community...

216
00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:34.466
...who wants to save you
from yourself!

217
00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:55.588
What gets into you all?

218
00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:59.092
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

219
00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:01.491
But we get no farther
with our studies.

220
00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:04.234
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

221
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.596
You've got not too bad of a brain.

222
00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:10.033
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

223
00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:12.173
Nobody's got anything on me.

224
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.174
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

225
00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:19.907
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

226
00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.016
You're about due, by my reckoning.

227
00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:23.585
That's why I'm warning you...

228
00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:27.291
...to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

229
00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:28.923
Do I make myself clear?

230
00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.560
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

231
00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:34.196
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

232
00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.730
You can rely on me, sir.

233
00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:44.459
Excuse me, brother.

234
00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:48.332
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

235
00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.039
Just a minute.

236
00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:18.962
Pardon me, ladies.

237
00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:30.173
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

238
00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:36.084
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

239
00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:43.359
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

240
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.997
Who you getting, bratty?

241
00:27:47.232 --> 00:27:49.359
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?

242
00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.501
The Heaven 17?

243
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.606
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

244
00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:04.110
I bet you've got little
pitiful, portable picnic players.

245
00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:06.543
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

246
00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:09.845
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

247
00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.113
You are invited.

248
00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:35.473
Hi, hi, hi, there.

249
00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:36.696
Well, hello.

250
00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:39.603
He are here!
He have arrived!

251
00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:41.436
Hooray!

252
00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:44.877
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well!

253
00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:51.317
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure
of this surprising visit?

254
00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.356
We got worried.

255
00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:06.135
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko...

256
00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:08.897
...and you had not turned up.

257
00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:11.569
And we thought
you might have been, like...

258
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.142
...offended by something
or other.

259
00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.813
So around we come to your abode.

260
00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:24.382
Appy polly loggies.

261
00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:27.817
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

262
00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:30.890
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

263
00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.562
Sorry about the pain.

264
00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:36.756
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

265
00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:43.440
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

266
00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:46.240
You sure the pain is gone?

267
00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:49.771
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

268
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:15.569
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

269
00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:21.434
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such...

270
00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:24.410
...does not become you,
my little brothers.

271
00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:29.386
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.

272
00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:32.450
Now then, Dim.

273
00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:36.887
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

274
00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:42.628
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

275
00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:45.335
That's part of the new way.

276
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.013
New way?
What's this about a new way?

277
00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:03.185
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

278
00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:07.523
If you must have it,
have it, then.

279
00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:10.954
We go around shop crasting
and the like...

280
00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:14.790
...coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

281
00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:17.431
And Will the English
in the coffee mesto...

282
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:21.264
...saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

283
00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:23.440
The shiny stuff. The ice!

284
00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:27.702
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

285
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:33.046
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

286
00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.216
Have you not everything you need?

287
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.387
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

288
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.716
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

289
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.522
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

290
00:32:47.398 --> 00:32:49.958
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

291
00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:54.235
Good! Real horrorshow!

292
00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:56.838
Initiative comes
to thems that wait.

293
00:32:57.508 --> 00:33:00.500
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

294
00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:05.314
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

295
00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:11.850
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

296
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.890
- Something to sharpen us up.
- Some moloko plus.

297
00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:22.263
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

298
00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:32.608
<i>As we walked along</i>
<i>the flatblock marina...</i>

299
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.108
<i>... I was calm on the outside,</i>
<i>but thinking all the time.</i>

300
00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.907
<i>So now it was to be</i>
<i>Georgie the General...</i>

301
00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:42.618
<i>... saying what we should do</i>
<i>and what not to do.</i>

302
00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:46.789
<i>And Dim as his mindless,</i>
<i>grinning bulldog.</i>

303
00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:50.687
<i>But suddenly I viddied that</i>
<i>thinking was for the gloopy ones...</i>

304
00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:56.093
<i>... and that the oomny ones used, like,</i>
<i>inspiration and what Bog sends.</i>

305
00:33:56.601 --> 00:34:00.435
<i>For now it was lovely music</i>
<i>that came to my aid.</i>

306
00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:03.765
<i>There was a window open</i>
<i>with a stereo on...</i>

307
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:07.273
<i>... and I viddied right at once</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

308
00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:16.438
<i>I had not cut into any</i>
<i>of Dim's main cables.</i>

309
00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:18.979
<i>And so with the help</i>
<i>of a clean tashtook...</i>

310
00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:21.549
<i>... the red, red kroovy</i>
<i>soon stopped.</i>

311
00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:25.516
<i>And it did not take long to</i>
<i>quieten the two wounded soldiers...</i>

312
00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:28.453
<i>... down in the snug</i>
<i>of the Duke of New York.</i>

313
00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:32.854
<i>Now they knew who was</i>
<i>master and leader.</i>

314
00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:35.298
<i>Sheep, thought I.</i>

315
00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.727
<i>But a real leader knows</i>
<i>always when, like...</i>

316
00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:41.199
<i>... to give and show generous</i>
<i>to his unders.</i>

317
00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.038
Now we're back to where we were.

318
00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:47.641
Yes?

319
00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.743
Just like before,
and all forgotten?

320
00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.642
Right, right, right?

321
00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:55.544
Right.

322
00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:59.548
Right.

323
00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:04.016
Right.

324
00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:09.159
Well, Georgie-boy...

325
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.368
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

326
00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:16.097
Not tonight.

327
00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:18.034
Not this nochy.

328
00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:21.234
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

329
00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:25.111
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

330
00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:28.682
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

331
00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:33.016
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

332
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.729
<i>It's this health farm.</i>

333
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.858
<i>A bit out of the town.</i>

334
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.360
<i>Isolated.</i>

335
00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:53.103
<i>It's owned by this rich ptitsa</i>
<i>who lives there with her cats.</i>

336
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:58.205
<i>The place is shut down for a week</i>
<i>and she's completely on her own.</i>

337
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.247
<i>It's full up with, like,</i>
<i>gold and silver...</i>

338
00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:05.478
<i>... and, like, jewels.</i>

339
00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:10.792
<i>Tell me more, Georgie-boy.</i>
<i>Tell me more.</i>

340
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.899
Oh, shit!

341
00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:37.517
Who's there?

342
00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:40.113
Excuse me, can you please help?

343
00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:41.916
There's been a terrible accident!

344
00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:45.095
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

345
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.098
I'm frightfully sorry.

346
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.527
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

347
00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.634
I suggest you use that.

348
00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.864
But missus, this is an emergency!

349
00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:58.938
It's a matter of life and death!

350
00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:02.942
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

351
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:08.942
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

352
00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:13.119
Very well, madam.

353
00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.686
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious...

354
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.726
...with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

355
00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:22.557
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

356
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.234
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

357
00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:28.563
Thank you very much.
Good night.

358
00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:06.608
Dim, bend down.

359
00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:11.881
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

360
00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.275
Radlett Police Station?

361
00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:46.448
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

362
00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:52.445
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

363
00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:55.557
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

364
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.793
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

365
00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:02.294
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

366
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.000
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

367
00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:09.137
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning...

368
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:13.605
...in connection with the writer
and his wife who were assaulted.

369
00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.937
Just a few minutes ago.

370
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.979
If you think that's necessary.

371
00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:23.947
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

372
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:27.284
All right, fine.

373
00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.352
Thank you very much.

374
00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.524
Hi, hi, hi, there.

375
00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.166
At last we meet.

376
00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:43.033
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not satisfactory.

377
00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.638
Who are you?

378
00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:48.812
How the hell did you get in here?

379
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:54.046
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

380
00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:59.885
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

381
00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.717
You filthy old soomaka.

382
00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:06.554
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

383
00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:10.289
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in.

384
00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:14.994
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

385
00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.673
It's a very important work of art.

386
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.920
What the bloody hell do you want?

387
00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:35.157
To be perfectly honest, madam...

388
00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:38.759
...I'm taking part in an
international students' contest...

389
00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:42.762
...to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

390
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.093
Cut the shit, sonny...

391
00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:49.931
...and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

392
00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:53.334
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...

393
00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:55.444
...before I throw you out!

394
00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:58.746
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

395
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:03.013
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

396
00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.187
Fucking...

397
00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.411
...little...

398
00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:08.514
...bastard!

399
00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:21.131
- Let's go. The police are coming!
- One minoota, droogie.

400
00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:30.636
You bastards! I'm blind!

401
00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:34.935
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!

402
00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:52.023
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

403
00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:56.529
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

404
00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:59.461
I know the law, you bastards.

405
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.972
Righty-right, Tom.

406
00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:14.349
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

407
00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:17.246
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

408
00:44:32.102 --> 00:44:34.832
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

409
00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.739
Shame, isn't it?

410
00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.668
Spoils all your beauty.

411
00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:44.340
Who gave you that, then?

412
00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:47.512
How'd you do that, then?

413
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.079
What's your point, you bastard?

414
00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:54.551
That is for your lady victim.

415
00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.052
You ghastly...

416
00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:58.022
...wretched scoundrel.

417
00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:01.591
Get him off me!

418
00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:04.693
You rotten little bastard!

419
00:45:12.943 --> 00:45:14.205
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

420
00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.106
Good evening, Sergeant.

421
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.472
They're in room B, sir.

422
00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:19.375
Thank you very much.

423
00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:21.544
Sergeant...

424
00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:22.717
Good evening.

425
00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:24.453
Good evening, Inspector.

426
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:27.623
- Would you like your tea now, sir?
- No, thank you, Sergeant.

427
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:29.825
May I have some
paper towels, please?

428
00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:32.391
We're interrogating
the prisoner now.

429
00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:36.225
- Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
- Thank you very much.

430
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.769
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.

431
00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:44.900
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

432
00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:46.973
Just look at the state of him.

433
00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:49.178
Love's young nightmare-like.

434
00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:51.346
Violence makes violence.

435
00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:53.606
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

436
00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:58.417
This is the end of the line for me.

437
00:45:58.622 --> 00:46:01.785
The end of the line, yes.

438
00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:03.626
And what of me, brother sir?

439
00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:05.522
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

440
00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:07.787
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

441
00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:10.932
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

442
00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:14.433
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

443
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.502
It was all their idea, brothers.

444
00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:19.436
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

445
00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:28.879
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

446
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.882
A murderer.

447
00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:33.713
Not true, sir.

448
00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.788
It was only a slight tolchok.

449
00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:38.518
She were breathing, I swear it.

450
00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.191
I've just come from the hospital.

451
00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.729
Your victim has died.

452
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:47.164
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

453
00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:49.372
This is some new form of torture.

454
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.905
- Say it, brother sir.
- It'll be your own torture.

455
00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:56.977
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

456
00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:01.910
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

457
00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.915
We'll hold him down.

458
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:07.852
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

459
00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:40.950
<i>This is the real weepy and tragic</i>
<i>part of the story beginning...</i>

460
00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:43.420
<i>... O my brothers and only friends.</i>

461
00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:46.127
<i>After a trial,</i>
<i>with judges and a jury...</i>

462
00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:50.628
<i>... and hard words spoken against</i>
<i>your friend and humble narrator...</i>

463
00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:55.030
<i>... he was sentenced to 14 years</i>
<i>in Staja Number 84-F...</i>

464
00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:58.766
<i>... among smelly perverts</i>
<i>and hardened prestoopniks.</i>

465
00:47:59.076 --> 00:48:02.876
<i>The shock sending my dada beating</i>
<i>his bruised and krovvy rookers...</i>

466
00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:05.445
<i>... against unfair Bog</i>
<i>in His Heaven.</i>

467
00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:08.913
<i>And my mum boo-hoo-hooing</i>
<i>in her mother's grief...</i>

468
00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:11.552
<i>... at her only child</i>
<i>and son of her bosom...</i>

469
00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:14.416
<i>... like, letting everybody down</i>
<i>real horrorshow.</i>

470
00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:17.559
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

471
00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:20.222
Right! Open up the cell!

472
00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:21.897
Yes, sir.

473
00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:40.445
Here are the prisoner's
committal forms.

474
00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.174
Thank you, mister.

475
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.516
- Name?
- Alexander DeLarge.

476
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.690
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.

477
00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:52.519
From this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir."

478
00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:53.593
Name?

479
00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:56.163
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

480
00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:57.455
Sentence?

481
00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:58.928
14 years, sir.

482
00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:00.033
Crime?

483
00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.430
Murder, sir.

484
00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:04.640
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

485
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:18.353
You are now 655321.

486
00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:21.853
It is your duty
to memorize that number.

487
00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.150
Thank you, mister. Well done.

488
00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:26.123
- Thank you.
- Let the officer out.

489
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.891
All right, empty your pockets.

490
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.734
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor...

491
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.341
...directly behind you...

492
00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:42.910
...655321?

493
00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:46.848
Then your toes belong...

494
00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:49.052
...on the other side of it!

495
00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.754
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

496
00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.526
Carry on.

497
00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.333
Pick that up...

498
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.333
...and put it down properly.

499
00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:21.175
One half-bar of chocolate.

500
00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:26.087
One bunch of keys
on white metal ring.

501
00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:31.092
One packet of cigarettes.

502
00:50:34.297 --> 00:50:36.424
Two plastic ball pens.

503
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.759
One black, one red.

504
00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:45.203
One pocket comb, black plastic.

505
00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:50.270
One address book,
imitation red leather.

506
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:00.990
One ten-penny piece.

507
00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:05.053
One white metal wristlet watch...

508
00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:09.287
...Timawrist, on a white metal
expanding bracelet.

509
00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.401
Anything else in your pockets?

510
00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:14.927
- No, sir.
- Right.

511
00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:18.298
Sign here for your
valuable property.

512
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.243
The tobacco and chocolate
you brought in...

513
00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:30.783
...you lose that...

514
00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.148
...as you are now convicted.

515
00:51:34.024 --> 00:51:37.255
Now over to the table
and get undressed.

516
00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:46.258
Were you in police custody
this morning?

517
00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:48.003
One jacket, blue pinstriped.

518
00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:49.329
Prison custody?

519
00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:50.664
Yes, sir, on remand.

520
00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:52.774
- One necktie, blue.
- Religion?

521
00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:54.101
C. Of E., sir.

522
00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:56.039
Do you mean the Church of England?

523
00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:58.042
Yes, sir.
The Church of England.

524
00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.270
Brown hair, isn't it?

525
00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:00.676
Fair hair, sir.

526
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:01.975
Blue eyes?

527
00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:03.618
Blue, sir.

528
00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:06.448
Do you wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses?

529
00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.554
No, sir.

530
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.725
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.

531
00:52:09.993 --> 00:52:13.724
Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?

532
00:52:13.997 --> 00:52:16.522
One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.

533
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.291
Have you ever had
any mental illness?

534
00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:23.400
Do you wear any false teeth
or any false limbs?

535
00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:25.899
One pair of trousers,
blue pinstriped.

536
00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:29.509
Have you ever had any attacks
of fainting or dizziness?

537
00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.338
One pair of socks, black.

538
00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:33.345
Are you an epileptic?

539
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.074
One pair of underpants,
white with blue waistband.

540
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:40.016
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a homosexual?

541
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.354
Right.

542
00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:44.151
- The mothballs, mister.
- Mothballs, sir.

543
00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.494
Now then, face the wall...

544
00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:49.559
...bend over and touch your toes.

545
00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:57.697
Any venereal disease?

546
00:52:57.941 --> 00:52:59.499
Crabs? Lice?

547
00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:02.735
- Through there for the bath.
- One for a bath.

548
00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:06.043
What's it going to be, eh?

549
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.408
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this...

550
00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.678
...though more in than out
for most of you?

551
00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:17.019
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word...

552
00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:20.957
...and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners...

553
00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.357
...in the next world
as well as this?

554
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.625
A lot of idiots you are...

555
00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:30.533
...selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

556
00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.468
The thrill of theft.

557
00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:33.572
Of violence.

558
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.472
The urge to live easy.

559
00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:39.408
Well, I ask you what is it worth...

560
00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:42.049
...when we have undeniable proof...

561
00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:45.413
...yes, incontrovertible
evidence...

562
00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:46.953
...that hell exists?

563
00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:48.418
I know!

564
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.216
I know, my friends.

565
00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:53.554
I have been informed...

566
00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.287
...in visions...

567
00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.055
...that there is a place...

568
00:53:57.267 --> 00:53:59.667
...darker than any prison...

569
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.997
...hotter than any flame
of human fire...

570
00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:05.571
...where souls...

571
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:10.007
...of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves...

572
00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:15.612
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.

573
00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:18.845
I say, like yourselves...

574
00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:20.687
...scream...

575
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:24.754
...in endless and
unendurable agony.

576
00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:26.860
Their skin...

577
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.621
...rotting and peeling.

578
00:54:29.866 --> 00:54:31.629
A fireball...

579
00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:34.200
...spinning in their
screaming guts!

580
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:37.872
I know. Yes, I know!

581
00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.172
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...

582
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.781
...in the prisoner's hymnal.

583
00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:52.216
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

584
00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:57.156
<i>I was a wandering sheep</i>

585
00:54:58.228 --> 00:55:00.856
- Sing up, damn you!
<i>- I did not love the fold</i>

586
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:02.530
Louder!

587
00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:09.862
<i>I did not love my shepherd's voice</i>

588
00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:14.876
<i>I would not be controlled</i>

589
00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:17.138
Louder!

590
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:20.640
<i>It had not been edifying.</i>
<i>Indeed not.</i>

591
00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:24.820
<i>Being in this hellhole</i>
<i>and human zoo for two years now.</i>

592
00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:28.183
<i>Being kicked and tolchoked</i>
<i>by brutal warders...</i>

593
00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:31.394
<i>... and meeting leering criminals</i>
<i>and perverts...</i>

594
00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.185
<i>... ready to dribble all over...</i>

595
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.365
<i>... a luscious young malchick</i>
<i>like your storyteller.</i>

596
00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:43.862
<i>It was my rabbit...</i>

597
00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:46.870
<i>... to help the prison charlie</i>
<i>with the Sunday service.</i>

598
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.170
<i>He was a bolshy,</i>
<i>great burly bastard.</i>

599
00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:53.507
<i>But he was very fond of myself,</i>
<i>me being very young...</i>

600
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.117
<i>... and also now very interested</i>
<i>in the Big Book.</i>

601
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:22.041
<i>I read all about the scourging</i>
<i>and the crowning with thorns.</i>

602
00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:24.212
<i>And I could viddy myself</i>
<i>helping in...</i>

603
00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:28.406
<i>... and even taking charge of</i>
<i>the tolchoking and the nailing in.</i>

604
00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:31.984
<i>Being dressed in the height</i>
<i>of Roman fashion.</i>

605
00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:46.424
<i>I didn't so much like</i>
<i>the latter part of the Book...</i>

606
00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.830
<i>... which is more like</i>
<i>all preachy talking...</i>

607
00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:51.232
<i>... than fighting</i>
<i>and the old in-out.</i>

608
00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:54.602
<i>I like the parts where these old</i>
<i>yahoodies tolchok each other...</i>

609
00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:57.108
<i>... and then drink</i>
<i>their Hebrew vino...</i>

610
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.574
<i>... and getting onto the bed</i>
<i>with their wives' handmaidens.</i>

611
00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.809
<i>That kept me going.</i>

612
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:37.051
"Seek not to be like evil men.

613
00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:39.614
Neither desire to be with them...

614
00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:42.984
...because their minds
studieth robberies...

615
00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:46.127
...and their lips speak deceits."

616
00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:49.854
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress...

617
00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:52.397
...thy strength
shall be diminished.

618
00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:54.296
Fine, my son. Fine.

619
00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:55.834
Father?

620
00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.571
I have tried, have I not?

621
00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:02.971
You have, my son.

622
00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:05.511
- I've done my best, have I not?
- Indeed.

623
00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:09.184
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

624
00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:13.719
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

625
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.857
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

626
00:58:17.093 --> 00:58:18.390
Father...

627
00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:22.661
...can I ask you
a question in private?

628
00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:26.201
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

629
00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.903
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

630
00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:44.349
Don't be shy to speak up.

631
00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:48.187
Remember...

632
00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:50.392
...I know of the...

633
00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:54.461
...urges that can
trouble young men...

634
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.255
...deprived...

635
00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.457
...of the society of women.

636
00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.703
It's nothing like that, Father.

637
00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:10.810
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

638
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.042
About this new treatment.

639
00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.649
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

640
00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:18.444
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

641
00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:21.485
Where did you hear about this?

642
00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:24.454
Who's been talking
about these things?

643
00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.127
These things get around.

644
00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.661
Two warders talk, as it might be.

645
00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:32.925
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

646
00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:36.836
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops...

647
00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:39.734
...and the newspaper
tells all about it.

648
00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:46.342
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

649
00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:51.647
I take it you are referring...

650
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.151
...to the Ludovico technique.

651
00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:57.256
I don't know what it's called.

652
00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:59.358
I just know it
gets you out quickly...

653
00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:02.130
...and makes sure you
never get back in again.

654
01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.699
That is not proven, 655321.

655
01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:10.099
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

656
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.338
It has been used, hasn't it?

657
01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:16.341
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

658
01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.013
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

659
01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.979
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

660
01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:27.855
I don't care about the dangers.

661
01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:31.686
I just want to be good.

662
01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:35.624
I want for the rest
of my life to be...

663
01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:37.958
...one act of goodness.

664
01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.668
The question is...

665
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:44.733
...whether or not this technique
really makes a man good.

666
01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.873
Goodness comes from within.

667
01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:49.203
Goodness...

668
01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.844
...is chosen.

669
01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.341
When a man cannot choose...

670
01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.744
...he ceases to be a man.

671
01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.480
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

672
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.595
I only know I want to be good.

673
01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.665
Be patient, my son.

674
01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:13.097
Put your trust in the Lord.

675
01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:18.599
Instruct Thy Son
and He shall refresh thee...

676
01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.742
...and shall give delight
to thy soul.

677
01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.607
Amen.

678
01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.409
- Mister!
- All present and correct, sir!

679
01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:54.633
Right!

680
01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.304
All present and correct, sir!

681
01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.426
Prisoners, halt!

682
01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:57.597
Now pay attention!

683
01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.104
I want you in two lines...

684
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.971
...up against that wall,
facing this way.

685
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.769
Go on, move!

686
01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:06.281
Hurry up!

687
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:07.811
Stop talking!

688
01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:16.216
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

689
01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.402
How many to a cell?

690
01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:35.507
Four in this block, sir.

691
01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:38.677
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

692
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:42.044
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

693
01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:46.015
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

694
01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:48.053
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

695
01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:50.589
The government can't be
concerned any longer...

696
01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.555
...with outmoded
penalogical theories.

697
01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:56.491
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

698
01:03:56.732 --> 01:04:00.259
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

699
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.232
IKill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

700
01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.701
Full implementation
in a year's time.

701
01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.203
Punishment means nothing to them.

702
01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:11.379
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

703
01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:12.773
You're absolutely right, sir.

704
01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:15.609
Shut your bleeding hole!

705
01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.775
Who said that?

706
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.854
I did, sir.

707
01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:27.790
What crime did you commit?

708
01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:30.123
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

709
01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:33.095
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

710
01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:34.961
Fourteen years, sir.

711
01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.432
Excellent.

712
01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.203
He's enterprising...

713
01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:41.467
...aggressive...

714
01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:42.904
...outgoing...

715
01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:43.975
...young...

716
01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.578
...bold...

717
01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.305
...vicious.

718
01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:48.807
He'll do.

719
01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:50.211
Fine.

720
01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:51.943
We could still look at C-block.

721
01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:54.246
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

722
01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.219
I want his records sent to me.

723
01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:57.790
This vicious young hoodlum...

724
01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.994
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

725
01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:02.220
Thank you very much
for this chance.

726
01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:05.229
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

727
01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.992
- Shall we go to my office?
- Thank you.

728
01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:16.107
Come in.

729
01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:18.778
Sir!

730
01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.915
655321. Sir!

731
01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.106
Very good, Chief.

732
01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.909
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

733
01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.654
Full name and number
to the governor.

734
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.687
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

735
01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:36.489
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

736
01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.361
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

737
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.604
The new Minister of the Interior.

738
01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:45.773
What they call a very new broom.

739
01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:50.377
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

740
01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.944
And orders are orders...
