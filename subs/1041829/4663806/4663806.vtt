{birds chirping}

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.947
Shit!

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.127
{indistinct chattering}

5
00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.470
Andrew, hey.

6
00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.967
Here you go. Your reguIar Iattes.

7
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:56.209
LiteraIIy saved my Iife.
Thank you. Thank you.

{eIevator dinging}

10
00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:11.921
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

11
00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:14.228
- Yeah.
- Me too.

12
00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.967
HeIIo, Frank? How's my favorite writer?

13
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.666
Of course you've been
thinking about our taIk

14
00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:22.367
because you know I'm right.

15
00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.308
Frank, peopIe in this
country are busy, broke,

16
00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:26.436
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

17
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.811
<i>''Hey! Don't watch
CSI: Indianapolis tonight.</i>

18
00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.249
Read a book! Read Frank's book.''
And that person is Oprah.

19
00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.556
{indistinct chatter}

20
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.319
- Cuttin' it cIose.
- One of those mornings.

21
00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.848
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

22
00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.157
- {both grunting}
- Sweet...

23
00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.857
- Uh, sorry.
- ...Jesus!

24
00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:46.797
- {Iaughter}
- {man} Rub some dirt on it, brother.

25
00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.291
Frank, the truth is aII
A-pIus noveIists do pubIicity.

26
00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.035
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

27
00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.974
Frank! Can I teII you what eIse
they have in common? A PuIitzer.

28
00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.611
I need the shirt off
your back. LiteraIIy.

29
00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:03.103
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

30
00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.549
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

31
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.246
Five, four, three, two, one.

32
00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.776
- {Iaughing}
- I know...

33
00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.085
- Shh!
- Later.

34
00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.160
- {gasps}
- Uh-oh.

35
00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.324
- {popping sound}
- {cIears throat}

36
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.971
{popping sound on numerous computers}

37
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.030
Uh, heIIo. HeIIo?

38
00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.647
Morning, boss. You have a
conference caII in 30 minutes.

39
00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.650
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

40
00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:40.049
Staff meeting at 9:00.

41
00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.644
Did you caII, um...
{groans} What's her name?

42
00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:44.121
The one with the ugIy hands.

43
00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:45.180
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

44
00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.623
Yes. I did caII her. I toId her that

45
00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.354
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

46
00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.794
you won't give her a reIease date.
Your immigration Iawyer caIIed.

47
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.956
He said it's imperative...

48
00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:53.659
CanceI the caII, push
the meeting to tomorrow

49
00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.132
and keep the Iawyer on the sheets.

50
00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.634
Oh, and get a hoId of PR,

51
00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.102
have them start drafting
a press reIease.

52
00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.604
<i>Frank is doing Oprah.</i>

53
00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.164
Wow. NiceIy done.

54
00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.405
If I want your praise,
I wiII ask for it.

55
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.414
Um...

56
00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:11.109
Who is, uh, who is JiIIian?

57
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.846
And why does she want me to caII her?

58
00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.990
WeII, that was originaIIy my cup.

59
00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.993
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

60
00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:23.052
Because your coffee spiIIed.

61
00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:32.568
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon Iight soy Iattes?

62
00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.665
I do. It's Iike Christmas in a cup.

63
00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.141
Is that a coincidence?

64
00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:39.576
- IncredibIy, it is.
- {phone ringing}

65
00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.773
I mean I wouIdn't possibIy drink
the same coffee that you drink

66
00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:43.441
just in case yours spiIIed.

67
00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:45.279
That wouId be pathetic.

68
00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.343
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

69
00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:48.683
Hey, Bob.

70
00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.587
ActuaIIy, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

71
00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.390
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

72
00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.920
- {tsks}
- {tsks}

73
00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.865
{tsks}

74
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.803
- {popping sound}
- {muItipIe pops}

75
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.898
{gasps} Oop!

76
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.903
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

77
00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:16.506
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

78
00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.914
- Can I say something?
- No.

79
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.009
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

80
00:05:20.052 --> 00:05:21.451
and this is the onIy one
I've given you.

81
00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.216
There's an incredibIe noveI in there.

82
00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:25.155
The kind of noveI you used to pubIish.

83
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.490
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

84
00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:31.018
just in case you spiII,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

85
00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:32.325
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

86
00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.593
if you didn't spiII in the first pIace.

87
00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:35.066
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

88
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.069
- Won't say a word.
- {cIears throat}

89
00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:44.475
Ah! Our fearIess Ieader and
her Iiege. PIease, do come in.

90
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.139
Oh. BeautifuI breakfront. Is it new?

91
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.206
It is EngIish Regency Egyptian
RevivaI, buiIt in the 1 800s

92
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.083
but, yes, it is new to my office.

93
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.747
Witty.

94
00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:58.416
Bob, I'm Ietting you go.

95
00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.052
Pardon?

96
00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:06.189
<i>I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do Oprah, and you didn't do it.</i>

97
00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.325
You're fired.

98
00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:11.897
I have toId you that is impossibIe.

99
00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:14.337
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

100
00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:16.068
{Tate} WeII that is
interesting, because I just

101
00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:18.599
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

102
00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.278
Excuse me?

103
00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:22.712
You didn't even caII him, did you?

104
00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:25.845
- But...
- I know, I know.

105
00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:29.116
Frank can be a IittIe scary
to deaI with. For you.

106
00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:32.386
Now, I wiII give you two
months to find another job.

107
00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.893
And then you can teII
everyone you resigned, OK?

108
00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:41.057
What's his twenty?

109
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.763
He's moving. He has crazy eyes.

110
00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.897
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

111
00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.932
- You poisonous bitch!
- {aII gasp}

112
00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.637
You can't fire me!

113
00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:54.976
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

114
00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.777
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

115
00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.716
just so that you can
Iook good to the board?

116
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.743
Because you are threatened by me!

117
00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:04.654
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

118
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.989
Just because you have
no sembIance of a Iife

119
00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:09.790
outside of this office,

120
00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:11.956
you think that you can treat aII of us

121
00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:13.658
Iike your own personaI sIaves.

122
00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.259
You know what? I feeI sorry for you.

123
00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:19.032
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

124
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.096
Nothing and no one.

125
00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:25.910
{breathes deepIy}

126
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.503
Listen carefuIIy, Bob.

127
00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:31.141
I didn't fire you because
I feeI threatened. No.

128
00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:34.584
I fired you because you're
Iazy, entitIed, incompetent

129
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.281
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

130
00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.653
than you do in your office.

131
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.021
And if you say another word,

132
00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:41.356
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

133
00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:43.918
Another word and you're
going out of here

134
00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.225
with an armed escort.

135
00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:47.129
Andrew wiII fiIm it with
his IittIe camera phone

136
00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:48.793
and he wiII put it
on that Internet site.

137
00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.062
- What was it?
- YouTube?

138
00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.536
ExactIy. Is that what you want?

139
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.198
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

140
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.504
{aII murmuring}

141
00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.567
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

142
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.737
and put it in my conference room.

143
00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:00.803
WiII do.

144
00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:01.938
And I need you around this weekend

145
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.346
to heIp review his fiIes
and his manuscript.

146
00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.976
- This weekend?
- You have a probIem with that?

147
00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:08.043
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

148
00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.486
so I was gonna go home and...

149
00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.319
...it's fine. I'II canceI it.

150
00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.291
You're actuaIIy saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

151
00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:15.623
so it's... good taIk, yeah.

152
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:20.758
I know, I know. OK, teII
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

153
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.358
Mom. What do you want me to teII you?

154
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.835
She's making me work the weekend.

155
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.167
No, I'm not... no.

156
00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:27.763
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

157
00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:28.899
to throw it aII away, OK?

158
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.431
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

159
00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:33.377
but we take aII of our submissions
around here very seriousIy.

160
00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:36.813
We'II get back to
you as soon as we can.

161
00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.840
- Was that your famiIy?
- Yes.

162
00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:40.613
- They teII you to quit?
- Every singIe day.

163
00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:43.850
Miss Tate's office.

164
00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:46.585
Oh... Yeah. OK. AII right.

165
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.718
Bergen and MaIIoy want to
see you upstairs immediateIy.

166
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:51.355
{groans} OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a Iot to do.

167
00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.421
Okey-doke.

168
00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:55.423
{phone ringing}

169
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.765
Good morning, Miss Tate.

170
00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.999
Jack, Edwin.

171
00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.806
<i>Margaret, congratuIations
on the Oprah thing.</i>

172
00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.710
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

173
00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:10.613
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
{chuckIes} Just kidding.

174
00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:14.278
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

175
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.345
that you wouIdn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

176
00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:17.787
because you weren't aIIowed
out of the country

177
00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.723
whiIe your visa appIication
was being processed?

178
00:09:19.758 --> 00:09:20.782
Yes. I do.

179
00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:23.192
And... you went to Frankfurt.

180
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.424
Yes, I did. We were going
to Iose DeLiIIo to Viking.

181
00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.489
So... reaIIy didn't
have a choice, did I?

182
00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.898
It seems that the
United States Government

183
00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.959
doesn't care much who
pubIishes Don DeLiIIo.

184
00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:33.767
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

185
00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:36.434
Great. So, we're aII good?
Everything good?

186
00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.943
Margaret, your visa appIication
has been denied.

187
00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:42.141
- {stammers}
- And you are being deported.

188
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.307
Deported?

189
00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:45.044
And apparentIy there
was aIso some paperwork

190
00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.449
that you didn't fiII out in time.

191
00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:50.945
Come on. Come on! It's not
Iike I'm even an immigrant!

192
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.981
I'm from Canada, for Christ's sake.

193
00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:55.391
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

194
00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.395
We can reappIy, but unfortunateIy

195
00:09:57.429 --> 00:10:00.421
you have to Ieave the country
for at Ieast a year.

196
00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:07.371
OK. OK, weII, that's
not ideaI, but, uh..,

197
00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.203
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

198
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.401
{Bergen} No, Margaret.

199
00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:11.739
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

200
00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:12.903
{MaIIoy} UnfortunateIy, Margaret,

201
00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:15.641
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

202
00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:18.081
UntiI this is resoIved I'm going
to turn operations over

203
00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.311
to Bob SpauIding.

204
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.013
Bob SpauIding? The guy I just fired?

205
00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.453
We need an editor in chief.

206
00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:25.855
He is the onIy person in the buiIding
who has enough experience.

207
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.722
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

208
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.728
We are desperate to have you stay.

209
00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:32.731
If there was any way, any way at aII

210
00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.323
that we couId make this work,
we'd be doing it.

211
00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:35.492
- {knocking}
- {Margaret} There is no way...

212
00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:36.558
I am begging you.

213
00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.229
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

214
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.828
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

215
00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:42.432
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
caIIed. She's on the Iine.

216
00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:43.532
- I know.
- {Andrew} She's on hoId.

217
00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:46.510
She needs to speak with you right away.
I toId her you were otherwise engaged.

218
00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:49.105
She insisted, so... sorry.

219
00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.775
So...

220
00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:02.784
Uh... {mouthing}

221
00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.430
{whispering} Come here.

222
00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:11.632
Uh... GentIemen, I understand.
I understand...

223
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.764
the predicament that we are in.

224
00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:16.468
And, um...

225
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.574
And there's, uh... weII...

226
00:11:20.612 --> 00:11:23.240
I think there's something
that you shouId know.

227
00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.984
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

228
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.113
We are getting married.

229
00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:31.782
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

230
00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:34.588
You and I are getting married! Yes.

231
00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:36.287
- We are.
- Getting married.

232
00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:37.761
- {mumbIing} We are getting married.
- Yes.

233
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:41.624
Isn't he your secretary?

234
00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:42.725
Assistant.

235
00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:46.499
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. TitIes.

236
00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:50.804
But, wouIdn't be the first time
one of us feII for our secretaries.

237
00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.834
WouId it, Edwin?

238
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.108
{Margaret} With Laquisha. Remember?

239
00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:58.674
So, yeah... The truth is,

240
00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:02.847
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two peopIe

241
00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:05.049
who weren't meant to
faII in Iove but we did.

242
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.421
No.

243
00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:11.486
AII those Iate nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

244
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.588
- Yeah...
- No.

245
00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:15.293
- Something happened.
- Something.

246
00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:18.462
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

247
00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.131
Can't, can't fight a...

248
00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:24.632
Can't fight a Iove Iike ours, so, uh...

249
00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:28.077
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

250
00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:31.981
Because, weII... we are happy. So happy.

251
00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.143
- {Bergen} Margaret.
- Yes?

252
00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:35.085
It's terrific.

253
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.849
Just make it IegaI. Mmm?

254
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.517
Oh! LegaI. {chuckIes}

255
00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:42.891
Yeah, weII, then...

256
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:45.226
...we need to get ourseIves
to the immigration office.

257
00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.892
So we can work this
whoIe mess out. Right?

258
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.798
{Margaret} Thank you
very much, gentIemen.

259
00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:50.893
We wiII do that right away.

260
00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:53.131
Thank you very much,
gentIemen. Thank you.

261
00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.402
- GentIemen.
- Thank you.

262
00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.069
{popping}

263
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.078
{woman whispers} Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

264
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.409
{woman ¶¶ 2} What is that about?

265
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.506
{man whispering} Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

266
00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:04.880
{snickering} Yeah.

267
00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.680
{woman ¶¶ 3} What is he thinking?

268
00:13:06.718 --> 00:13:07.810
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

269
00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:09.878
{indistinct chatter}

270
00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:12.516
Dude, for reaI. Her? {Iaughing}

271
00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:14.822
{woman ¶¶ 4} Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

272
00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.830
{Margaret cIears throat}

273
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:35.637
{cIearing throat}

274
00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:37.806
What?

275
00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.084
I don't understand what's happening.

276
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.088
{Margaret} ReIax. This is for you, too.

277
00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.453
Do expIain.

278
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.720
They were going to make Bob chief.

279
00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:48.419
So naturaIIy I wouId have to marry you.

280
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.052
{Margaret} And what's the probIem?

281
00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:52.427
Like you were saving yourseIf
for someone speciaI?

282
00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.592
I Iike to think so.
Besides, it's iIIegaI.

283
00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:58.831
They're Iooking for terrorists,
not for book pubIishers.

284
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.395
- Margaret.
- Yes?

285
00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:03.499
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

286
00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:06.568
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the Iives of miIIions

287
00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:08.341
with the written word are dead.

288
00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:16.811
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

289
00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:18.914
That means you're out on the street
aIone Iooking for a job.

290
00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:21.448
That means aII the time that
we spent together, aII the Iattes,

291
00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:23.688
aII the canceIed dates,
aII the midnight Tampax runs,

292
00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:27.028
were aII for nothing and aII your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

293
00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:29.465
But don't worry, after the required
aIIotment of time,

294
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:30.968
we'II get a quickie divorce
and you'II be done with me.

295
00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:32.834
But untiI then, Iike it or not,

296
00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:34.805
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

297
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.035
- {phone ringing}
- Phone.

298
00:14:44.983 --> 00:14:47.110
{indistinct chatter}

299
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.951
- This way.
- Margaret.

300
00:14:52.991 --> 00:14:55.016
- {hisses} Come.
- The Iine...

301
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.084
Next, pIease.

302
00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:57.755
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

303
00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.320
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

304
00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:02.162
I need for you to fiIe this
fiancee visa for me, pIease.

305
00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:05.092
{scoffs}

306
00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:09.205
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

307
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.300
PIease, come with me.

308
00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.903
{woman} Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

309
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.310
I have a bad feeIing about this.

310
00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:18.373
{knocking}

311
00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.351
- Hi. HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

312
00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:24.878
Hi. I'm Mr. GiIbertson.

313
00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:26.982
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

314
00:15:27.025 --> 00:15:28.356
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

315
00:15:28.393 --> 00:15:30.190
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

316
00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.890
It's a, uh, crazy day today.

317
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.091
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

318
00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:36.157
And I can't teII you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

319
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:40.262
- on such short notice.
- OK. {sighs}

320
00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:42.796
<i>¶¶  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh
buh, buh, buh, buuuh</i>

321
00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.672
So, I have one question for you.

322
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.907
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

323
00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:52.042
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at CoIden Books?

324
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.712
- That's ridicuIous.
- Where did you hear that?

325
00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:58.052
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

326
00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.853
WouId it be Bob SpauIding?

327
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:01.222
Bob SpauIding.

328
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.559
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

329
00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:08.532
Bob is nothing but a disgruntIed
former empIoyee.

330
00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.659
And I apoIogize.

331
00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:12.397
But we know you're incredibIy busy

332
00:16:12.437 --> 00:16:16.305
with a room fuII of gardeners
and deIivery boys to tend to.

333
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:17.899
If you just give us our next step,

334
00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.968
we wiII be out of your
hair and on our way.

335
00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:22.637
Miss Tate, pIease.

336
00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:28.179
Let me expIain to you the
process that's about to unfoId.

337
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.621
Step one wiII be a scheduIed interview.

338
00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:35.184
I'II put you each in a room,
and I'II ask you every IittIe question

339
00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:37.195
that a reaI coupIe
wouId know about each other.

340
00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:41.427
Step two, I dig deeper.
I Iook at your phone records,

341
00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:43.798
I taIk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

342
00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:46.269
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

343
00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.967
you wiII be deported indefiniteIy.

344
00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:51.407
And you, young man,
wiII have committed a feIony...

345
00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:55.436
- {woman shouting in Spanish}
- ...punishabIe by a fine of $250,000

346
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.712
and a stay of five years
in federaI prison.

347
00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:06.052
{GiIbertson} So, Andrew.

348
00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:09.492
You wanna... you want to taIk to me?

349
00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.129
No?

350
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:19.102
Yes?

351
00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.073
The truth is...

352
00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.109
{Andrew cIears throat}

353
00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:32.913
Mr. GiIbertson, the truth is...

354
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.714
Margaret and I...

355
00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:39.457
...are just two peopIe

356
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:42.483
who weren't supposed to faII in Iove.

357
00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.057
{Andrew} But did.

358
00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:49.095
We couIdn't teII anyone we work with

359
00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:51.728
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

360
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.237
- {GiIbertson} Promotion?
- Yeah.

361
00:17:53.271 --> 00:17:57.105
- Your...?
- We... we both feIt, uh...

362
00:17:57.142 --> 00:18:01.272
...that it wouId be deepIy inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

363
00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.975
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
- ...whiIe we were...

364
00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:08.044
So... {cIears throat}

365
00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:11.146
Have the two of you toId your parents
about your secret Iove?

366
00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:14.522
Oh, I... impossibIe.
My parents are dead.

367
00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.823
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

368
00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:19.160
Are your parents dead?

369
00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:21.358
- Oh, no, his are very much aIive.
- No... very much.

370
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.699
Very much. They're, ah... WeII,
we were gonna teII them this weekend.

371
00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:28.695
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whoIe
famiIy's coming together.

372
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.332
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

373
00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:32.400
{GiIbertson} And where is this
surprise gonna take pIace?

374
00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:34.537
At Andrew's parents' house.

375
00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:35.705
Where is that Iocated again?

376
00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:38.375
Um... {scoffs}
Why am I doing aII the taIking?

377
00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:39.782
It's your parents' house.

378
00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:41.251
Why don't you teII him
where it is. Jump in.

379
00:18:42.687 --> 00:18:45.417
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

380
00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.482
- AIaska.
- AIaska?

381
00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:49.619
You're gonna go to AIaska this weekend?

382
00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:53.131
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

383
00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:56.362
We are going to AIaska.
AIaska, that's where...

384
00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:59.302
That's where my IittIe...
that's where my Andrew's from.

385
00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.170
{GiIbertson} OK.

386
00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:05.665
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

387
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.645
I wiII see you both
at 1 1 :00 Monday morning

388
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.648
for your scheduIed interview,

389
00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:14.083
and your answers better
match up on every account.

390
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.685
- Thank you.
- HeIIo?

391
00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:18.814
- I'm Iooking forward to this one.
- We're Iooking forward to this one.

392
00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:19.915
Thank you.

393
00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.722
Gonna be fun.
I'II be checking up on you.

394
00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:23.785
You got it.

395
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:33.200
OK... so, what's gonna happen is
we wiII go up there.

396
00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:35.263
We wiII pretend Iike we're
boyfriend and girIfriend,

397
00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.899
teII your parents we're engaged.

398
00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:38.534
Uh, use the miIes for the tickets.

399
00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:42.274
I guess I wiII pop for you to fIy first
cIass. But make sure you use the miIes.

400
00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.645
If we don't get the miIes,
we're not doing it.

401
00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.616
Oh, and pIease confirm
the vegan meaI, OK?

402
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.618
'Cause Iast time they actuaIIy
gave it to a vegan,

403
00:19:47.652 --> 00:19:49.279
and they, uh... forced me to eat

404
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.812
this cIammy, warm, creamy
saIad thing, which was...

405
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.848
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

406
00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:56.224
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

407
00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:57.626
What? What?

408
00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:01.488
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

409
00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.524
Genius! Genius.
He compIeteIy feII for it.

410
00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:04.830
I was serious.

411
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.771
I'm Iooking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jaiI.

412
00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:09.000
That changes things.

413
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.170
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

414
00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:14.235
Bye-bye, Margaret.

415
00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:15.746
- Andrew!
- It reaIIy has been

416
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.181
- a IittIe sIice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

417
00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.453
I'II make you editor. Fine.

418
00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:26.082
If you do the AIaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

419
00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:29.025
I wiII make you editor. Happy?

420
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.460
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

421
00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.986
And you'II pubIish my manuscript.

422
00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.198
Ten thousand copy first...

423
00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:37.792
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

424
00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.770
And we'II teII my famiIy
about our engagement

425
00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:41.431
when I want and how I want.

426
00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:43.771
Now, ask me niceIy.

427
00:20:43.808 --> 00:20:44.968
''Ask you niceIy'' what?

428
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.776
Ask me niceIy to marry you, Margaret.

429
00:20:50.815 --> 00:20:53.841
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

430
00:21:02.994 --> 00:21:04.018
Fine.

431
00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.998
{honking}

432
00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.769
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I Iike this. Yeah.

433
00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.967
- WiII you marry me?
- No.

434
00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:18.566
Say it Iike you mean it.

435
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.441
{cIears throat}

436
00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:24.580
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

437
00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:27.710
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm Iistening.

438
00:21:27.752 --> 00:21:30.744
WouId you pIease,
with cherries on top, marry me?

439
00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:36.020
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'II do it.

440
00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:38.689
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

441
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.102
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

442
00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:58.138
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

443
00:21:58.183 --> 00:21:59.878
but the bad news is
that you have four days

444
00:21:59.918 --> 00:22:04.719
to Iearn aII this about me.
So, you shouId... probabIy get studying.

445
00:22:08.293 --> 00:22:10.557
You know aII the answers
to these questions about me?

446
00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.620
- Scary, isn't it?
- {Margaret} A IittIe bit.

447
00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:15.064
- What am I aIIergic to?
- Pine nuts.

448
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.034
And the fuII spectrum of human emotion.

449
00:22:17.068 --> 00:22:19.036
Oh, that's... that was funny.
{chuckIes}

450
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.867
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

451
00:22:20.905 --> 00:22:23.772
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

452
00:22:23.808 --> 00:22:25.708
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

453
00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:27.405
Oh, you're pretty sure?

454
00:22:27.445 --> 00:22:29.811
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatoIogist caIIed

455
00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.782
and asked about a Q-switched Iaser.

456
00:22:31.816 --> 00:22:33.374
I of course GoogIed a Q-switched Iaser

457
00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.716
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

458
00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:37.312
But you canceIed your appointment.

459
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.448
So what is it? TribaI ink?

460
00:22:40.492 --> 00:22:42.426
Japanese caIIigraphy? Barbed wire?

461
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.293
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you Iike this.

462
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.594
Thank you. You're gonna have
to teII me where it is, though.

463
00:22:47.632 --> 00:22:49.099
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

464
00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:51.659
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

465
00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.898
On to another question.
Let me see, Iet me see.

466
00:22:53.938 --> 00:22:56.805
Oh, here's one. Whose pIace do we
stay at, yours or mine?

467
00:22:56.841 --> 00:22:58.240
That's easy. Mine.

468
00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:00.141
And why wouIdn't we stay at mine?

469
00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:02.669
Because I Iive at CentraI Park West.

470
00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:05.649
And you probabIy Iive at some
squaIid IittIe studio apartment

471
00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:08.653
with stacks of yeIIowed
Penguin CIassics.

472
00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:11.656
<i>{woman on PA} Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.</i>

473
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.284
<i>We are beginning our descent
into Juneau.</i>

474
00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:16.054
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

475
00:23:17.328 --> 00:23:21.355
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

476
00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:23.492
- {rumbIing}
- {rattIing}

477
00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:26.529
Whoa.

478
00:23:50.528 --> 00:23:53.793
AII right. Here we go.

479
00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:58.168
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

480
00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:01.400
- {woman shouting}
- {Iaughter}

481
00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:06.704
Hi. Right this way...

482
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:12.078
- Hi!
- Oh...

483
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.711
- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

484
00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:16.653
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

485
00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:19.452
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

486
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.187
Oh, you know your father.
He's aIways working.

487
00:24:22.227 --> 00:24:24.593
Never mind about him. Where's your girI?

488
00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.097
Uh, she's... right there.

489
00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.724
- {Gammy} Ah.
- {Andrew} There she is.

490
00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:31.736
I guess the word ''girI''
is inappropriate.

491
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.101
Annie.

492
00:24:34.205 --> 00:24:35.229
- Hi!
- {Margaret} HeIIo.

493
00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:37.036
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, heIIo.

494
00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:39.509
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

495
00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:42.638
- PIeasure.
- WeII, heIIo there.

496
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.674
Now, do you prefer being caIIed Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

497
00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:49.584
We've heard it both ways.

498
00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:51.418
{Gammy} ActuaIIy we've heard it
Iots of ways.

499
00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.048
She's kidding.

500
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:55.559
- Oh! Oh... OK.

501
00:24:55.593 --> 00:24:57.060
Thank you so much for...

502
00:24:57.095 --> 00:24:58.790
aIIowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

503
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.027
Oh, you're weIcome.
We're thriIIed to have you.

504
00:25:02.066 --> 00:25:03.795
Let's get you two back to the fort.

505
00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.962
- OK.
- {Gammy} Oh...

506
00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:09.030
- It's so good to see you.
- {grunts} There we are.

507
00:25:42.907 --> 00:25:44.169
{Margaret whispers} Andrew...

508
00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:47.667
{sIightIy Iouder} Andrew. Andrew!

509
00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:52.141
{yeIps} PIease, don't do that.

510
00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:55.346
You didn't teII me about aII
the famiIy businesses, honey.

511
00:25:55.386 --> 00:25:58.583
He was probabIy just
being modest, dear.

512
00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:00.113
Oh.

513
00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:10.693
What are we doing? ShouIdn't we
check into our hoteI right now?

514
00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:13.135
Oh, we canceIed your reservation.

515
00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:14.604
FamiIy doesn't stay at a hoteI.

516
00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:16.334
You're gonna stay in our home.

517
00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:18.365
Oh, great! Great.

518
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:19.808
- What?
- {grunts} God.

519
00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:22.039
You're gonna wanna use your Iegs
to Iift that one.

520
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.913
Andrew! HeIp her with those.

521
00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:27.440
I'd Iove to, but she won't Iet me
do anything.

522
00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:30.977
She insists on doing it aII herseIf.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

523
00:26:35.426 --> 00:26:37.053
{grunts}

524
00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:41.426
Come on, sweetie.

525
00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:45.495
{Gammy} You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

526
00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.172
This is the Iast of 'em.

527
00:26:57.749 --> 00:26:59.011
- Oh!
- Ooh.

528
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.213
- {Andrew} Five second ruIe.
- Got it!

529
00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:04.585
That wiII dry right off.

530
00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:06.852
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

531
00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.756
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

532
00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:11.023
Psst! You know I can't swim.

533
00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:13.553
Hence, the boat.

534
00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:21.937
Come on.

535
00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:28.412
{Andrew} Come on. Here we go.

536
00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:38.384
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

537
00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.482
Shh.

538
00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:47.391
She comes with a Iot of baggage.

539
00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:48.763
Just gonna give you
a IittIe hand here.

540
00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:53.670
Hand off ass! Off ass!

541
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.334
There you go. You're there.

542
00:28:03.614 --> 00:28:07.641
CongratuIations.
I'm a hundred years oId now.

543
00:28:07.685 --> 00:28:09.983
{boat engine starting}

544
00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:36.139
{Grace} Here we are. We're home.

545
00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:40.542
That is your home?

546
00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:43.980
Who are you peopIe?

547
00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.860
{Margaret} Why did you teII me
you were poor?

548
00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:02.737
- {Andrew} I never said I was poor.
- But you never toId me you were rich.

549
00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.969
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

550
00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:07.443
OK, you know what?
That's something onIy rich peopIe say.

551
00:29:07.478 --> 00:29:09.002
{woman} Hey, Andrew! WeIcome home!

552
00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.777
Hi! Mom, what is this?

553
00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:14.444
Nothing. It's just a IittIe
weIcoming party.

554
00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:15.713
Is that a crime?

555
00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:17.880
Just 50 of our cIosest
friends and neighbors.

556
00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.583
And aII excited to meet you.

557
00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:21.956
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

558
00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:24.291
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

559
00:29:24.328 --> 00:29:26.956
Come on. Let's go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

560
00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:29.965
Put your back into it.

561
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.967
<i>{¶¶  MichaeI BubIe:
I've Got You Under My Skin}</i>

- {indistinct chatter}
- {Iaughter}

563
00:29:35.606 --> 00:29:37.801
{woman} So nice to meet you,
Margaret. WeIcome to Sitka.

564
00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:39.833
JiII? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pIeasure.

565
00:29:39.877 --> 00:29:43.040
Why didn't you teII me you were
some kind of AIaskan Kennedy?

566
00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:44.139
How couId I?

567
00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:47.674
We were in the middIe of taIking about
you for the Iast three years.

568
00:29:47.718 --> 00:29:49.413
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

569
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.183
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

570
00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:53.213
PeopIe need to think that we are
in Iove. So Iet's just...

571
00:29:53.257 --> 00:29:54.781
That, that's no probIem.
I can do that.

572
00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:57.693
I can pretend to be the doting fiance.
That's easy.

573
00:29:57.728 --> 00:29:59.195
But for you, it's going to require

574
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.630
that you stop snacking on
chiIdren whiIe they dream.

575
00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:04.362
Very funny. When are you going
to teII them we're engaged?

576
00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:05.767
I'II pick the right moment.

577
00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:09.671
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

578
00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:12.335
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

579
00:30:12.376 --> 00:30:14.367
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

580
00:30:14.412 --> 00:30:16.277
- Hi. PIeasure.
- Margaret!

581
00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.713
Hi, how are you? PIeasure.

582
00:30:17.748 --> 00:30:21.149
So I aIways wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

583
00:30:21.185 --> 00:30:23.278
{man} That's a great question, Louise.

584
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:25.721
I'm curious to know the answer myseIf.

585
00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:28.553
- HeIIo, Dad.
- Son.

586
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.884
This must be Maggie.

587
00:30:30.928 --> 00:30:32.555
Uh, Margaret.

588
00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:36.055
- Joe. PIeasure to meet you.
- PIeasure's mine.

589
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.695
So why don't you teII us exactIy
what a book editor does.

590
00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:43.195
Besides taking writers out
to Iunch and getting bombed.

591
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.607
{Louise} Now that sounds Iike fun.

592
00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:47.440
No wonder you Iike being an editor.

593
00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:50.709
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

594
00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:53.239
Maggie here is the editor.

595
00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:54.842
Margaret.

596
00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:58.378
- So you're actuaIIy...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

597
00:30:58.422 --> 00:31:00.049
WeII. How about that.

598
00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.456
{Louise} Huh.

599
00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:03.483
I think I'II get a refiII.

600
00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.028
Charming.

601
00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:13.895
That's a heII of
a first impression, Dad.

602
00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:15.997
What the heII, Andrew?

603
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.804
You show up here after aII this
time with this woman you hated

604
00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:20.174
- and now she's your girIfriend?
- We just got here.

605
00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:21.508
Can we wait two seconds

606
00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:22.979
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

607
00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:26.245
Just never figured you for a guy
who sIept his way to the middIe.

608
00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.979
ActuaIIy, I'II have you know
that that woman in there

609
00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:29.646
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

610
00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:30.779
She's your meaI ticket,

611
00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:32.288
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

612
00:31:32.323 --> 00:31:36.692
She's not my meaI ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancee.

613
00:31:36.727 --> 00:31:39.287
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

614
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.127
I'm getting married.

615
00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.602
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

616
00:31:46.637 --> 00:31:47.968
WouId you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

617
00:31:48.005 --> 00:31:49.302
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

618
00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.671
It's a tradition.

619
00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:52.369
It's the texture. I'm not a fish person.

620
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.810
- You'II Iike it.
- You're very sweet.

621
00:31:54.845 --> 00:31:57.439
I think if you'II just taste it.

622
00:31:57.481 --> 00:31:58.880
{muffIed} Thank you so much.

623
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.846
{Andrew} Ladies and gentIemen...

624
00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:06.379
I have a very important
announcement to make.

625
00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:08.016
Margaret and I are getting married.

626
00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:09.321
It's the paprika.

627
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.725
So sorry.

628
00:32:10.761 --> 00:32:13.559
That's OK. It's wash-and-wear.

629
00:32:15.399 --> 00:32:18.391
{Andrew} Yep. Honey? Where you at?

630
00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:20.901
Here it is.

631
00:32:23.874 --> 00:32:25.569
Come on down here, pumpkin.

632
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.407
- {Andrew} AII right.
- OK.

633
00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:30.005
Oh, Iook at her. Look at her.

634
00:32:30.047 --> 00:32:31.207
{cIapping}

640
00:32:44.695 --> 00:32:46.322

641
00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:47.558

- Mmm.

642
00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:49.259
'Cause it was briIIiant.
BriIIiant timing.

643
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.268

647
00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:03.536
- Right.

648
00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:06.516
...we're being compIeteIy rude. Hi.

649
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.747

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.456
- What story?
- What story?

655
00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:21.260
About how you proposed.

656
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:25.633
Oh! How a man proposes says
a Iot about his character.

657
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.729
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

658
00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:30.400
I actuaIIy wouId Iove

659
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:31.567

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.715
'Cause I think we

665
00:33:44.755 --> 00:33:48.054
Huh! Wow, OK.

666
00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:51.926
Wow, where to begin... this story.

667
00:33:51.962 --> 00:33:54.954
WeII... um, wow.

668
00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:57.058
Mmm... yeah.

669
00:33:57.101 --> 00:34:01.970
OK, weII, um, Andrew and I...

670
00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.770
Andrew and I were about to ceIebrate

671
00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:07.403
- our first anniversary together.
- {aII} Aw...

672
00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:10.278
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

673
00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:13.511
And he was scared.
Like a IittIe tiny bird.

674
00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:15.951
So I started Ieaving him
IittIe hints here and there...

675
00:34:15.986 --> 00:34:18.750
...because I knew he wouIdn't
have the guts to ask, but...

676
00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:21.622
That's not exactIy how it happened.

677
00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.149
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

678
00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:25.754
I mean, I picked up on
aII her IittIe hints.

679
00:34:25.796 --> 00:34:27.821
This woman's about as subtIe as a gun.

680
00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:30.095
- {aII Iaugh}
- {Andrew} Yeah.

681
00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.465
What I was worried about was

682
00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:33.367
that she might find this IittIe box...

683
00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:36.430
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

684
00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:38.635
where he'd taken the time to cut out

685
00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:41.440
tiny, IittIe pictures of himseIf. Yes.

686
00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:45.176
Just pasted aII over the
box. Oh! So beautifuI.

687
00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:47.650
So I opened that beautifuI,
IittIe decoupage

688
00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:51.553
and out fIuttered these tiny,
IittIe hand-cut heart confettis.

689
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:55.685
And once they cIeared,
I Iooked down, and I saw...

690
00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:58.388
...the most beautifuI, big...

691
00:34:58.429 --> 00:34:59.953
...fat nothing.

692
00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:01.362
No ring.

693
00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:02.991
- No ring?
- What?

694
00:35:03.033 --> 00:35:06.025
No. But inside that box...

695
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.731
...underneath aII that crap...

696
00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:10.036
...there was a IittIe
handwritten note...

697
00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:13.601
with the address to
a hoteI, date, and time.

698
00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:15.339
ReaI Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

699
00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:16.744
{man} Yeah.

700
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.612
- MascuIine.
- {grunts}

701
00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.514
Anyway, naturaIIy, Margaret thought...

702
00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:22.109
I thought he was seeing someone eIse.

703
00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:24.280
- {crowd murmurs}
- It was a terribIe time for me,

704
00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:26.687
but I went to that hoteI anyway.

705
00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:28.817
I went there and I pounded on the door,

706
00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:30.690
but the door was aIready unIocked.

707
00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:34.596
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

708
00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.156
- Standing.
- KneeIing.

709
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.758
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petaIs,

710
00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:41.260
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

711
00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:44.866
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

712
00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:48.174
And when he heId back the tears
and finaIIy caught his breath,

713
00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:49.270
he said to me...

714
00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:50.371
''Margaret, wiII you marry me?''

715
00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:53.747
And she said, ''Yep.''
The end. Who's hungry?

716
00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:56.079
{crowd cooing}

717
00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.782
That is quite a story.

718
00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.723
- {Gammy} Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

719
00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:03.192
You are so sensitive.

720
00:36:03.994 --> 00:36:06.986
Hand-cut confetti? {Iaughs}

721
00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:09.864
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

722
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.992
{man} Give her a kiss!

723
00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:13.094
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

724
00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:14.161
- Come on!
- {aII cheering}

725
00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:15.763
OK, aII right.

726
00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:17.671
OK. Here we go. Ready?

727
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:23.576
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth Iike you mean it.

728
00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:27.209
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- {aII chanting} Kiss her!

729
00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:31.153
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

730
00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:32.815
OK!

731
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.049
- OK. AII right.
- OK.

732
00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.253
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

733
00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.760
- Oh!

734
00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:43.426
Andy! Give her a reaI kiss!

735
00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:46.129
- {chuckIing} Gammy.
- A reaI one!

736
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.694
- {woman} Yeah.
- {woman ¶¶ 2} You can do it!

737
00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:49.399
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it reaIIy fast.

738
00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:53.001
- {both} Mmmm.

739
00:36:53.043 --> 00:36:55.978
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

740
00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:58.174
- {muffIed} OK.
- Mmm.

741
00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:08.017
Hmm.

742
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.024
I'm so happy for you two!

743
00:37:12.062 --> 00:37:15.429
So happy! So happy!

744
00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:17.331
{woman} Let's get the champagne!

745
00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:20.203
So here we are.

746
00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.768
This is your bedroom.

747
00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:30.970
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautifuI. And the view.

748
00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.812
And here's the bed.

749
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.648
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

750
00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:38.655
So... where is Andrew's room?

751
00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:40.623
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any iIIusions

752
00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:43.525
that you two don't
sIeep in the same bed.

753
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:45.825
{Iaughing} He'II sIeep

754
00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:48.229
Oh, great, 'cause we Iove to snuggIe.

755
00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:50.199
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snuggIers.

756
00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:52.464

- Oh, my God. What is it?

757
00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:56.405
- CaIm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

758
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.032
Who is this?

759
00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:01.670
- That's Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

760
00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:03.771
We just rescued him from the pound,

761
00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:05.805
and he's stiII in training. Sorry.

762
00:38:05.849 --> 00:38:07.817
Just be sure you don't
Iet him outside,

763
00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:09.648
or the eagIes wiII snatch him.

764
00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:11.552
No, don't you Iisten to her.

765
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:13.386
She's just puIIing
your Ieg, isn't she?

766
00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:16.757
By the way, there are extra
toweIs and Iinens and things

767
00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:17.852

770
00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.194
It has speciaI powers.

771
00:38:23.233 --> 00:38:26.225
Oh, what kind of speciaI powers?

772
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.897

- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

776
00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.779
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

777
00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.542

{Margaret} So, uh... you haven't

785
00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:02.502
I haven't had a Iot of vacation
time the Iast three years.

786
00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:04.734
Stop compIaining.

787
00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:10.272
Um... Don't Iook, OK?

788
00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.410
OK.

789
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:14.879
Are your eyes cIosed?

790
00:39:14.918 --> 00:39:16.215
CompIeteIy.

791
00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:19.620
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

792
00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:31.962
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to AIaska.

793
00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:35.460
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hoteI aIone.

794
00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:38.498
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sIeep?

795
00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.601
- Fine.
- Great.

796
00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:51.018
{exhaIes, cIears throat}

Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feeI

819
00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:33.416
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

820
00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:36.915
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

821
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:42.796
Frank. Frank. Frank, darIing.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

822
00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:44.960

823
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.928
{panting}

824
00:41:49.606 --> 00:41:52.074
{Margaret} You are...

Yes, Frank, of course
I'm Iistening to you.

826
00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:55.939

831
00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:07.251
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

832
00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:10.818
I think it wouId be
a mistake to back out.

833
00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:14.058
- Because, Frank, for so many years...

835
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.228
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

836
00:42:19.269 --> 00:42:22.170
I think it's time that the worId
get to enjoy your words as weII.

837
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.730
They are just so rich

00:42:31.381 --> 00:42:32.973
I just, uh, want you

00:42:33.016 --> 00:42:35.507

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:49.028
Frank, Frank.

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.260
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

850
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.428
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, Iisten, Frank.

851
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.200
I don't want to seII you on anything,

852
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.037
but this is your Iegacy, this book.

853
00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.474
And I think it's up to you to

854
00:42:59.509 --> 00:43:00.533
present your Iegacy to the worId.

855
00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:03.774
And caII me tomorrow with your decision.

856
00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:05.543
And my phone is on
aII the time! OK, bye-bye.

857
00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:06.606
No! Wait!

858
00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:10.013
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

859
00:43:10.053 --> 00:43:11.577
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

860

I need that phone. Take the dog.

Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.624
{both Iaughing}

865
00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:24.395
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

866
00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:29.133
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

867
00:43:29.172 --> 00:43:32.300
She's pIaying with Kevin.
We thought she didn't Iike him.

868
00:43:32.342 --> 00:43:33.366
WiII you go get her, Andy?

869
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.378
We have a whoIe day pIanned for her,

870
00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:37.346
and she needs to get ready.

871
00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:39.645
Yeah. TeII her we have

872
00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:41.310
Mmm.

- Come on. Right here.
- What the heII are you doing?

875
00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:52.551
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was compIeteIy right.

876
00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:54.393
The eagIe came
and tried to take the dog.

877
00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.889
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

878
00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:00.301
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

879
00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:02.805
He's got my phone, and Frank's
caIIing me on that phone.

880
00:44:02.839 --> 00:44:04.170
ReIax, aII right?

881
00:44:04.207 --> 00:44:07.267
We'II order another phone, same number.
We'II go into town tomorrow and get it.

882
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.369

885
00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:16.885
You're going out with Mom and the girIs.

886
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.582
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

887
00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.090

- You'II Iove it.

888
00:44:21.124 --> 00:44:22.591

00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:27.062
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

892
00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:28.223

893
00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.062
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

894
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.829

895
00:44:31.868 --> 00:44:33.631
There we go.

896
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.366
Yeah, that's nice.

897
00:44:36.406 --> 00:44:39.102
Yeah. That's nice.

00:44:39.142 --> 00:44:41.702
There we go. Isn't that nice?

899
00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.269

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:44.780
- {Margaret} Mmm. Yeah.
- {Andrew} Boop boop boop.

901
00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:47.079
If you touch my ass one more time,

902
00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:49.278
I wiII cut your baIIs
off in your sIeep. OK?

903
00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:51.150
- Yeah.
- There you go.

904
00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:53.850
AII righty now. So, uh...
We cIear on that?

905
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.256
- Yeah.

906
00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:58.090
Hmm. Ow.

907
00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.730
{spIashing}

908
00:45:11.541 --> 00:45:14.772
- {Joe} Jeez.
- You want to see me?

909
00:45:14.811 --> 00:45:17.507
Your mom found these eco-baIIs.

910
00:45:17.547 --> 00:45:19.412
They dissoIve in water.

911
00:45:19.449 --> 00:45:21.007
{grunts}

912
00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.781
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

913
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.779
Anyway, she, uh... is a IittIe peeved.

914
00:45:27.824 --> 00:45:31.817
ApparentIy, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts Iast night.

915
00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.159
It was a IittIe bit of a shock

916
00:45:33.196 --> 00:45:34.754
to find out that
you're getting married...

917
00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:38.029
...especiaIIy when none of us
even knew you were dating.

918
00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:42.869
The point is... I owe you an apoIogy.

919
00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:46.669
Accepted.

920
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.440
There's something eIse.

921
00:45:49.479 --> 00:45:53.313
I've been going over my
retirement pIans recentIy,

922
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.874
and it got me thinking.

923
00:45:56.586 --> 00:45:58.110
I've done a Iot of things in my Iife.

924
00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:01.852
PracticaIIy buiIt an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

925
00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:03.052
It doesn't mean anything unIess...

926
00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.492
UnIess you have someone to Ieave it to.

927
00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:07.964
- We aIready discussed this.
- I'd Iike to discuss it again.

928
00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:11.934
You have responsibiIities here.

929
00:46:11.968 --> 00:46:13.731
I think I've been
more than understanding

930
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.169
about your goofing off in New York.

931
00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:16.866
I need you to quit pIaying around...

932
00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:17.965
Here we go again.

933
00:46:18.008 --> 00:46:20.306
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriousIy?

934
00:46:20.343 --> 00:46:22.208
When you start acting seriousIy.

935
00:46:22.245 --> 00:46:24.713
I'm sorry.

936
00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:26.716
I feeI sorry for you, Dad.

937
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.275
I wish you had another son. I reaIIy do.

938
00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:30.479
One who wanted to stay here.

939
00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.283
One who wanted to take over
the famiIy business.

940
00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:34.381
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

941
00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:37.757
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

942
00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:42.731
my Iife in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

943
00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:45.360
But it makes me happy. You understand?

944
00:46:48.538 --> 00:46:51.996
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

945
00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.067
WeII, that's a first.

946
00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:58.810
You know what? ApoIogy not
accepted. Have fun out here.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.620
{Grace} There is no way you
couId Ieave her at home.

950
00:47:14.664 --> 00:47:16.427
She had to be here. AbsoIuteIy.

951
00:47:16.466 --> 00:47:18.491
She's been coming here forever.

952
00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:21.299
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

953
00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:24.637

Sitka's greatest treasures.

Oh, yes, I want to go.

Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

Mmm-hmm, I think the part

I can't beIieve this is happening.

1464
01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.894
My mother made this dress by hand.

In this very shop. In 1 929.

{Margaret} Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

This is Iike an Easter egg hunt.

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:18.135

Oh, that wouId, uh...

01:15:54.683 --> 01:16:00.622
Now, Iet's make this
absoIute perfection.

1492
01:16:00.655 --> 01:16:02.782
{Gammy chuckIing}

1493
01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:08.319
Now, just one speciaI touch
and you're ready.

1494
01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:16.868
It's been in the famiIy
for more than 1 50 years.

1495
01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.873
Annie, it's beautifuI,
but I don't reaIIy think...

1496
01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:21.569
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

1497
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.102
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

1498
01:16:25.146 --> 01:16:27.307
when they got married.

1499
01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.408
They were quite a scandaI, you know.

1500
01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:33.410
He was Russian and she
was TIingit, and back then

1501
01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:36.253
you had to get approvaI
from every member of the tribe

1502
01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.622
before you got married.

1503
01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:39.217
AImost broke them up.

1504
01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.196
WeII... how did they stay together then?

1505
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.926
She was a Iot Iike you. Tough.

1506
01:16:44.966 --> 01:16:47.901
WouIdn't take ''no'' for an answer.

1507
01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:51.804
She was good for him.

1508
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.603
I want you to have it.

1509
01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:57.134
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

1510
01:16:57.178 --> 01:17:00.807
Grandmothers Iove to give
their stuff to their grandchiIdren.

1511
01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:03.579
It makes us feeI Iike we'II
stiII be part of your Iives

1512
01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.017
even after we're gone.

1513
01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:07.248
Take it.

1514
01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:12.519
{cIears throat}

1515
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.927
Are... are you aII right, dear?

1516
01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:19.927
{exhaIes deepIy} I, uh...

1517
01:17:21.469 --> 01:17:24.404
Uh... WeII, I, um...

1518
01:17:26.574 --> 01:17:32.308
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

1519
01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:35.111
make sure there was enough time
to get aII the sewing done.

1520
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.119
{chuckIes} Don't you worry about that.

1521
01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.621
- You're gonna be beautifuI.
- OK.

1522
01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:44.250
- Now Iet's get you out of those pins.
- OK.

1523
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.841
{footsteps approaching}

1524
01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:08.508
AII right.

1525
01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:18.025
This is untied. Hop on in.

1526
01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:19.083
{grunting}

1527
01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:22.795
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1528
01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.897
Whoa! What...

1529
01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.491
Mind teIIing me what the heII's wrong?

1530
01:18:26.534 --> 01:18:28.229
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

1531
01:18:28.269 --> 01:18:30.294
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop taIking, pIease!

1532
01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:42.308
WouId you mind teIIing me
what's happening now?

1533
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.817
Margaret.

1534
01:18:46.454 --> 01:18:48.979
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

1535
01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.218
{Andrew} You forgot what?

1536
01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.818
I forgot what it was
Iike to have a famiIy!

1537
01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:55.227
I've been on my own since I was 1 6

1538
01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:58.198
and I forgot what it feIt
Iike to have peopIe Iove you

1539
01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.497
and make you breakfast and say, ''Hey!

1540
01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.127
We'd Iove to come down
for the hoIidays.''

1541
01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:05.662
And I say, ''WeII, why don't we
come up and see you instead?''

1542
01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:08.198
And give you neckIaces!
And you have aII that here,

1543
01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:10.905
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

1544
01:19:10.945 --> 01:19:13.175
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

1545
01:19:13.214 --> 01:19:14.272
You were there, remember?

1546
01:19:14.315 --> 01:19:15.873
Your famiIy Ioves you. Do you know that?

1547
01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.475
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

1548
01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.180
And you're stiII wiIIing
to put them through this?

1549
01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.244
They're not gonna find out!

1550
01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:21.585
How do you know they won't find out?

1551
01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:22.954
Because you said so yourseIf.

1552
01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.959
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourseIf!

1553
01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.187
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

1554
01:19:26.227 --> 01:19:28.252
Whoa! Whoa!

1555
01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.923
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

1556
01:19:29.964 --> 01:19:31.397
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

1557
01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.367
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

1558
01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:35.631
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- WiII you caIm down! HoId on!

1559
01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.095
{Andrew} Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1560
01:19:38.139 --> 01:19:41.768
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

1561
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:45.405
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

1562
01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.812
Now... Oh, great.

1563
01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:49.180
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

1564
01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.276
- {Margaret} Andrew!
- Margaret?

1565
01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:53.981
- {gasping} Andrew!
- Margaret!

1566
01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:58.850
I can't swim!

1567
01:19:58.893 --> 01:20:00.417
Margaret!

1568
01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.724
{Andrew} To the buoy!

1569
01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.231
- What?
- To the buoy!

1570
01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.157
OK.

1571
01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:15.071
{gasping}

1572
01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.813
AII right, come on! Give me your hand!

1573
01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.318
- Hey! Give me your hand!
- {gasping}

1574
01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:27.048
Margaret! Give me...

1575
01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.612
Come on, give me your hand!

1576
01:20:28.656 --> 01:20:30.146
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

1577
01:20:31.192 --> 01:20:32.682
I got you. {grunting}

1578
01:20:33.928 --> 01:20:36.328
- {Margaret gasping, shuddering}
- Come on.

1579
01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.195
{grunts} What the heII
were you thinking?

1580
01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.894
CouId've gotten yourseIf kiIIed.

1581
01:20:39.934 --> 01:20:43.335
You turned the boat and
made me faII in, you jackass.

1582
01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:45.396
You Iet go of the steering wheeI, Ahab.

1583
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.068
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1584
01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:51.408
AII right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

1585
01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:56.008
Come on. It's OK. {panting}

1586
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:57.210
That's OK.

1587
01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:01.850
It's OK.

1588
01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.412
I want to taIk to both of you.

1589
01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:51.131
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

1590
01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.442
ToId you I'd check up on you.

1591
01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.183
What did you do?

1592
01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:10.123
I got a phone caII from
Mr. GiIbertson here,

1593
01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:12.422
who toId me that if you were Iying,

1594
01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.690
and he strongIy beIieves that you are,

1595
01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:16.253
he wouId send you to prison.

1596
01:22:16.297 --> 01:22:18.390
So I fIew him up here.

1597
01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.458
- Dad.
- LuckiIy for you,

1598
01:22:20.501 --> 01:22:23.527
your father negotiated
a deaI on your behaIf.

1599
01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:26.802
{GiIbertson} Now, this offer's
gonna Iast for 20 seconds,

1600
01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.570
so Iisten cIoseIy.

1601
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:29.702
You're gonna make a statement

1602
01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:31.405
admitting this marriage is a sham...

1603
01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:32.743
...or you're gonna go to prison.

1604
01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.010
You teII the truth, you're off the hook,

1605
01:22:35.049 --> 01:22:37.813
and she is going to go back to Canada.

1606
01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:46.022
Ah, weII. Take the deaI.

1607
01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:50.463
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

1608
01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.295
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

1609
01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:53.994
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

1610
01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:56.333
Six months ago we started
dating, we feII in Iove.

1611
01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:58.236
I asked her to marry me, she said ''yes.''

1612
01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.468
I'II see you at the wedding.

1613
01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.744
WeII, you know.

1614
01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:38.034
So...

1615
01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.741
...you sure about this?

1616
01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:42.340
Not reaIIy.

1617
01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.887
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

1618
01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:49.947
but I think that...

1619
01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.185
You'd do the same for me.

1620
01:23:51.225 --> 01:23:52.852
Right?

1621
01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:56.594
- {knocking}
- Hope everyone is decent.

1622
01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.121
You need to come with me.

1623
01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.861
{Gammy} Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

1624
01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.562
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

1625
01:24:01.602 --> 01:24:03.365
It's tradition.

1626
01:24:03.404 --> 01:24:05.395
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

1627
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.668
...use the Baby Maker.

1628
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.437
{Gammy} You've got your whoIe
Iives to be together.

1629
01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:11.274
- {Andrew} OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

1630
01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.542
{sighs}

1631
01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:19.780
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

1632
01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:23.723
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

1633
01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:32.063
See you in the morning?

1634
01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:34.533
Yeah.

1635
01:24:47.281 --> 01:24:50.273

1637
01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:38.657
Hey, Gammy.

1638
01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:42.231

in front of famiIy and friends.

1651
01:27:27.341 --> 01:27:30.242
For it is their famiIy and friends

Oh, it, it's, uh, not a question,

1658
01:27:56.103 --> 01:27:58.367
but I do have something I need to say.

1659
01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:02.342
- Margaret.
- Can it wait tiII after?

1660
01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:06.904
Uh... No. No.

1661
01:28:16.857 --> 01:28:18.256
{sighs}

1662
01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:22.194
- {cIears throat} Hi there.
- {aII murmur} Hi.

1663
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:24.390
Thank you aII so much for coming out.

1664
01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:27.595
{Margaret} I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

1665
01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.762
to make about the wedding.

1666
01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:33.103
- A confession, actuaIIy.
- What are you doing?

1667
01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:36.701
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

1668
01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:40.908
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

1669
01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.609
And because I didn't want to Ieave

1670
01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.880
this wonderfuI country of yours,

1671
01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:47.854
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

1672
01:28:47.888 --> 01:28:49.321
Margaret, stop it.

1673
01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:53.225
See, Andrew has aIways had
this extraordinary work ethic.

1674
01:28:54.695 --> 01:28:56.356
Something I think he Iearned from you.

1675
01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.724
And for three years I
watched him work harder

1676
01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:01.735
than anyone eIse at our company.

1677
01:29:01.769 --> 01:29:05.034
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

1678
01:29:05.072 --> 01:29:08.269
...he wouId, he wouId do
just about anything.

1679
01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:15.873
So I bIackmaiIed him to
come up here and to Iie to you.

1680
01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:21.045
{Margaret} AII of you.

1681
01:29:21.088 --> 01:29:23.818
And I thought it wouId
be easy to watch him do it.

1682
01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.917
{cIears throat}

1683
01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.518
But it wasn't.

1684
01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:32.559
Turns out it's not easy
to ruin someone's Iife

1685
01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.228
once you find out
how wonderfuI they are.

1686
01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:38.228
{crowd murmurs}

1687
01:29:41.475 --> 01:29:43.500
You have a beautifuI famiIy.

1688
01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.473
{Margaret} Don't Iet this
come between you.

1689
01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:52.816
This was my fauIt.

1690
01:29:52.853 --> 01:29:54.684
Margaret...

1691
01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.622
Andrew, this was a business deaI,

1692
01:29:56.657 --> 01:30:00.684
and you heId up your end,
but now the deaI is off.

1693
01:30:01.962 --> 01:30:03.259
I'm sorry.

1694
01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.394
And, you, meet me at the dock.

1695
01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.231
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

1696
01:30:13.941 --> 01:30:15.932
{crowd chattering}

1697
01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:23.207
{chuckIes}

1698
01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:27.543
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

1699
01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:29.180
Andrew, you Iied to us.

1700
01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.622
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

1701
01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:32.057
I'II expIain everything Iater.

1702
01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.425
I'm sorry.

1703
01:31:11.832 --> 01:31:14.699
<i>{Margaret} You were right.
This book is special.</i>

1704
01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.362
<i>I lied because I knew publishing meant</i>

1705
01:31:16.403 --> 01:31:17.665
<i>I'd lose you as an assistant</i>

1706
01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.935
<i>but... you have an extraordinary eye,</i>

1707
01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:23.000
<i>and I'll make sure we
buy this before I leave.</i>

1708
01:31:23.043 --> 01:31:27.173
<i>Have an amazing life.
You deserve it. Margaret.</i>

1709
01:31:29.416 --> 01:31:32.647
WeII, that was, uh... crazy.

1710
01:31:32.686 --> 01:31:34.017
{snorts}

1711
01:31:34.054 --> 01:31:36.488
You know, peopIe are gonna be
taIking about this forever.

1712
01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:40.019
Yeah. Yeah.

1713
01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:42.855
Are you OK?

1714
01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.965
Yeah. No. Uh...

1715
01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:53.004
I just feeI... You know
what the probIem is?

1716
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.237
The probIem is that this woman...

1717
01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:59.804
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

1718
01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.315
First there's the whoIe Ieaving
thing. I understand that.

1719
01:32:02.349 --> 01:32:05.147
It's a sham wedding.
It's kind of stressfuI.

1720
01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:08.212
But then she goes ahead
and she Ieaves this note.

1721
01:32:08.255 --> 01:32:10.120
Because she doesn't have the decency...

1722
01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:12.284
the humanity to do it to my face.

1723
01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:17.423
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

1724
01:32:17.464 --> 01:32:19.056
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

1725
01:32:19.099 --> 01:32:20.964
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

1726
01:32:21.001 --> 01:32:22.764
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

1727
01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.031
because we had a deaI!

1728
01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:28.269
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1729
01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:29.503
She just makes me a IittIe crazy.

1730
01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:32.979
{Gert chuckIes} Yeah. I can see that.

1731
01:32:33.013 --> 01:32:37.074
So you're just gonna Iet her go?

1732
01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:52.332
So, what now?

1733
01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:55.335
{GiIbertson} WeII... now that
you're Ieaving voIuntariIy,

1734
01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:58.065
it aII becomes very civiIized.

1735
01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:00.869
Once we Iand in New York,
you have 24 hours

1736
01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.934
to head back to Canada.

1737
01:33:11.318 --> 01:33:13.650
- Andrew, what's happening?
- I got to taIk to her.

1738
01:33:13.687 --> 01:33:14.915
- Why wouId you do that?
- Boys!

1739
01:33:14.955 --> 01:33:15.979
This has nothing to do with you.

1740
01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.047
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

1741
01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.581
{Joe} I'm not gonna Iet you do this.

1742
01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:20.093
{Andrew} I'm not asking
your permission here.

1743
01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:23.324
- {gasps}
- Annie! Joe! Joe!

1744
01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:26.561
Annie! Joe!

1745
01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.592
I think I'm having a heart attack.

1746
01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:31.070
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

1747
01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.936
- Easy, easy.
- {man} Get a doctor!

1748
01:33:36.977 --> 01:33:38.069
I got it.

1749
01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.336
Andrew.

1750
01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:14.312
You two need to stop fighting.

1751
01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:17.010
{Gammy} You'II never see eye to eye.

1752
01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:21.948
But you're famiIy.

1753
01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:30.229
Promise me you'II stand by Andrew.

1754
01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:33.131
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

1755
01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:36.867
I promise.

1756
01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:41.240
Andrew.

1757
01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:47.236
Promise me you'II work harder
to be a part of this famiIy.

1758
01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.306
I wiII.

1759
01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:54.284
{Andrew} I wiII, Gammy.

1760
01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:59.953
WeII, then, the spirits can take me.

1761
01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.757
Oh, Annie.

1762
01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.163
Gammy?

1763
01:35:16.643 --> 01:35:18.372
I guess they're not ready for me.

1764
01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:21.444
I'm feeIing much better, sonny.

1765
01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:23.382
{Gammy} No need to take us
to the hospitaI.

1766
01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:25.214
Take us to the airport, pIease.

1767
01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:27.083
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

1768
01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:28.554
- Oh, come on!
- {Iaughing}

1769
01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:30.420
WeII, it was the onIy
way I couId get you two

1770
01:35:30.457 --> 01:35:32.857
to shut up and get us to the airport!

1771
01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:34.952
{man} Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.

1772
01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:37.964
Larry Ferris, don't
make me caII your mother.

1773
01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:40.159
{Larry} You got it.

1774
01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:44.033
{sighs} You scared the heII out of me.

1775
01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:53.204
Yep. You shouId've
given up back in New York.

1776
01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:56.478
See, I'm Iike EIiot Ness.

1777
01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:59.611
I aIways get my man.

1778

I'm that good.

1779
01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.850
FIight 1 601 , as soon

1780
01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:06.189

<i>- Chuck! It's Drew Paxton.

Hey, uh... I have a IittIe
favor I need from you, buddy...

1787
01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:32.343
Margaret's on that pIane. I got

1788
01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:33.683
<i>{Chuck} Oh, yeah!</i>

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.483
I heard about your Iady baiIin'.

1790
01:36:35.522 --> 01:36:38.548
<i>- Drag-oIa. {Iaughs}

Oh, no.

No!

1796
01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:56.141
- What's wrong?
- Margaret's on that pIane.

1797
01:36:56.176 --> 01:36:58.440
- And he didn't get to teII her.
- TeII her what?

1798
01:36:58.479 --> 01:36:59.946
That he Ioves her.

1799
01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:02.813
So she couId teII him
that she Ioves him, too.

1800
01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.010
OK, but how does he...

1801
01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.416
If she didn't Iove him,
she wouIdn't have Ieft.

1802
01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:06.942
Of course not.

1803
01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:08.511
Am I the onIy one not getting this?

1804
01:37:08.555 --> 01:37:12.423
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

1805
01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:13.926
Oh! Oh. Look down.

<i>Sorry, man. There was

1808
01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:22.095
Thanks, Chuck.

1809
01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:29.438
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you feIt about her.

1810

1824
01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:06.165
Why are, why are you panting?

1825
01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:08.367
Because I've been running.

1826
01:39:08.408 --> 01:39:11.241
- ReaIIy. From AIaska?
- I need to taIk to you.

1827
01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.973
Yeah? WeII, I don't have time to taIk.

1828
01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:15.413
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

1829
01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:17.144
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

1830
01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:18.242
I want to make sure everything is...

1831
01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:20.378
Margaret! Stop taIking!

1832
01:39:22.322 --> 01:39:24.449
{aII gasp}

1833
01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:25.981
{Andrew} Gotta say something.

1834
01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.721
- {whispering} OK.
- This wiII just take a sec.

1835
01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.661
Fine. What?

1836
01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:35.397
Three days ago, I Ioathed you.

1837
01:39:35.435 --> 01:39:37.630
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

1838
01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:38.968
Or poisoned.

1839
01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:42.601
- Oh, that's nice.
- I toId you to stop taIking.

1840
01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:45.237
Then we had our IittIe
adventure up in AIaska

1841
01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:47.645
and things started to change.

1842
01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:50.343
Things changed when we kissed.

1843
01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:54.253
And when you toId me about your tattoo.

1844
01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:59.085
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

1845
01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.491
- {aII murmuring}
- {woman} Uh-huuuh.

1846
01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:01.653
Naked?

1847
01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:03.663
WeII, I didn't see anything...

1848
01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.062
{Andrew} Yeah, you did.

1849
01:40:05.098 --> 01:40:09.364
But I didn't reaIize any of
this untiI I was standing aIone.

1850
01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:13.203
In a barn... wife-Iess.

1851
01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.868
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

1852
01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:17.376
when it suddenIy dawned on me

1853
01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:21.711
that the woman I Iove is about
to be kicked out of the country.

1854
01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.149
So, Margaret.

1855
01:40:28.388 --> 01:40:29.514
Marry me.

1856
01:40:32.959 --> 01:40:35.450
Because I'd Iike to date you.

1857
01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:51.007
Trust me. You don't reaIIy
want to be with me.

1858
01:40:51.044 --> 01:40:52.773
Yes, I do.

1859
01:40:54.414 --> 01:40:57.406
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

1860
01:40:57.451 --> 01:41:00.045
I've been aIone aII this time.

1861
01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:02.055
I'm comfortabIe that way.

1862
01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:04.114
And I think it wouId
just be a Iot easier

1863
01:41:04.157 --> 01:41:10.187
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just Ieft.

1864
01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:13.657
You're right.

1865
01:41:19.172 --> 01:41:21.766
That wouId be easier.

1866
01:41:37.557 --> 01:41:41.015
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1867
01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:46.558
{crowd murmurs}

1868
01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:07.820
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

1869
01:42:07.854 --> 01:42:09.378
I'm gonna take that as a ''yes.''

1870
01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:11.448
Oh, OK.

1871
01:42:14.494 --> 01:42:16.519
{crowd chattering}

1872
01:42:25.972 --> 01:42:28.907
{man} Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

1873
01:42:28.942 --> 01:42:30.671
{Iaughter}

1874
01:42:31.878 --> 01:42:33.869
{cIapping}

1875
01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:40.646
{GiIbertson} So, Iet me see
if I've got this right.

1876
01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:43.121
You two are engaged again.

1877
01:42:43.156 --> 01:42:44.714
- {Andrew} Yes.
- {Margaret} Yes.

1878
01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:46.851
For reaI?

1879
01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:48.954
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1880
01:42:48.995 --> 01:42:50.053
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

1881
01:42:50.096 --> 01:42:51.222
Because one wrong answer...

1882
01:42:51.264 --> 01:42:54.461
I'm gonna take you down.

1883
01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:59.533
- OK.
- OK.

1884
01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.471
Let's do it.

1885
01:43:11.918 --> 01:43:13.442
{GiIbertson} When did you
first start to date?

1886
01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:15.352
Last week.

1887
01:43:15.388 --> 01:43:18.619
- {GiIbertson} That going weII?
- So far it's great. Thank you.

1888
01:43:18.658 --> 01:43:20.148
{GiIbertson} What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

1889
01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:21.751
Men's Speed Stick?

1890
01:43:21.795 --> 01:43:25.094
{GiIbertson} What fIavor? Musk? AIpine?

1891
01:43:25.131 --> 01:43:26.428
Was it Iove at first sight?

1892
01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.593
{inhaIes} No.

1893
01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:32.469
I Ioved her from the beginning.

1894
01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:33.768
{GiIbertson} What side of the
bed does Margaret sIeep on?

1895
01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:35.536
She sIeeps on the Ieft.

1896
01:43:35.575 --> 01:43:37.008
What side of the bed do you sIeep on?

1897
01:43:39.045 --> 01:43:43.379
Look, are they souI mates? Eeeh.

1898
01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:46.044
Uh... WiII they kiII each other? No.

1899
01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:47.212
{GiIbertson} Are you a good driver?

1900
01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:49.848
Oh, exceIIent driver. ExceIIent.

1901
01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:53.587
{makes crashing,
screaming, siren sounds}

1902
01:43:53.627 --> 01:43:56.027
Oh.

1903
01:43:56.062 --> 01:43:59.054
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

1904
01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:00.999
...more swarthy, darker.

1905
01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:03.662
We don't use the word
''Margaret'' around Kevin.

1906
01:44:03.703 --> 01:44:08.003
He stiII hasn't warmed up to her.

1907
01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.736
- Margaret.
- {barks}

1908
01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.767
- Margaret.
- {barks}

1909
01:44:11.811 --> 01:44:13.540
See? It's the damnedest thing.

1910
01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.207
I have never farted in front of him.

1911
01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:17.648
Nor wiII I ever fart in front of him.

1912
01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:20.209
She farts in her sIeep.

1913
01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:22.153
{GiIbertson} WouId you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

1914
01:44:22.188 --> 01:44:25.419
You can teII by the way
she drinks her soda pop

1915
01:44:25.458 --> 01:44:27.824
that she's a good dancer.

1916
01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:29.089
{GiIbertson} Uh-huh. How, how...

1917
01:44:29.129 --> 01:44:33.566
How is the soda pop
reIevant to the dancing?

1918
01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.261
I don't understand this.

1919
01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:38.237
- I caII him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

1920
01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:39.932
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

1921
01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:42.168
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

1922
01:44:42.208 --> 01:44:45.405
Sometimes I caII him Rick.

1923
01:44:45.445 --> 01:44:46.912
{GiIbertson} How do you speII ''Ramone?''

1924
01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:49.814
{thickIy accented} R-A-M-O-N-E.

1925
01:44:49.849 --> 01:44:51.749
{GiIbertson} CouId you do that
again in EngIish, pIease?

1926
01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:54.652
When you say, you know, the
position in the reIationship...

1927
01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:56.053
{GiIbertson} Top or bottom?

1928
01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:59.058
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

1929
01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:00.821
{GiIbertson} You took an oath
when you waIked in this office.

1930
01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:03.328
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

1931
01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:04.625
{GiIbertson} Laura shouId've
done that, but she didn't.

1932
01:45:04.664 --> 01:45:06.529
- That's OK.
- Who's Laura?

1933
01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:08.898
She's the girI behind you.
Don't Iook around.

1934
01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.197
{GiIbertson} Which of
the foIIowing numbers

1935
01:45:10.236 --> 01:45:13.034
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

1936
01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:15.234
I'm sorry. Let me say the Iist, pIease.

1937
01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:16.299
I'm sorry?

1938
01:45:16.343 --> 01:45:17.605
{GiIbertson} He knew
your favorite coIor.

1939
01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:19.271
- BIue?
- {GiIbertson} Wrong!

1940
01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.836
- Red?
- No!

1941
01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.404
Dark... Maybe Iike a hunter green?

1942
01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:23.848
{GiIbertson} No. White.

1943
01:45:23.883 --> 01:45:25.145
- White?
- OK, moving on.

1944
01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:26.584
Favorite coIor is bIue.

1945
01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:30.522
What's her favorite coIor
when she's not at home?

1946
01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:31.956
I don't know.

1947
01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:33.755
{GiIbertson} Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?

1948
01:45:33.793 --> 01:45:37.661
Yes, I'm a citizen!
{guffawing} Are you crazy?

1949
01:45:37.697 --> 01:45:39.665
{Iaughs}

1950
01:45:39.699 --> 01:45:42.600
What reIevance a baII in a net

1951
01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:44.570
or a Fruit RoII-Up or a Pop-Tart

1952
01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:47.164
has to do with my
reIationship with Andrew?

1953
01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.731
{GiIbertson} If you're
getting excited...

1954
01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:51.903
- Who are you engaged to?
- {sighs}

1955
01:45:51.945 --> 01:45:56.143
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

1956
01:45:56.182 --> 01:45:57.342
{GiIbertson} Who are you engaged to?

1957
01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:59.079
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

1958
01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:04.580
And on the wedding day,
who wiII be next to you?

1959
01:46:04.624 --> 01:46:06.922
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

1960
01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.656
- {GiIbertson} FinaI answer?
- That work? Yeah, finaI answer.

1961
01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:12.995
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

1962
01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:16.730
<i>{sings God Bless America}</i>

1963
01:46:20.106 --> 01:46:21.573
That's a great song.

1964
01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:23.337
{GiIbertson} That was beautifuI.
That was reaIIy beautifuI.

1965
01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:25.037
Mama Cass.
