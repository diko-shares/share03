00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.746
[rapid footsteps approaching]

4
00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.148
-You're late, Jacques.
-Sorry, Father.

5
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:22.449
Go fetch the wine.

6
00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:23.384
[Jacques under his breath]
Why don't

7
00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.752
you go fetch the wine?

8
00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.420
-Pardon?
-[Jacques] Er, nothing.

9
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.956
[tolling continuing]

10
00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:55.849
[priest] Let your spirit
come upon these gifts

11
00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:59.787
to make them holy
so that they may become for us,

12
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.491
the body and blood of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

13
00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:06.293
[bell tinkles]

14
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.764
Body of Christ.

15
00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:11.832
[woman] Amen.

16
00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:16.504
-The blood of Christ.
-Amen.

17
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.451

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.479

[footsteps approaching]

22
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.235
-Father.
-Yes?

23
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.003
-There's someone here.
-Where?

24
00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.271
[clatter]

25
00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:35.342

26
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.360

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.937
[breath exhaling]

29
00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:06.407
Who's there?

30
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.941
[objects clattering]

31
00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:11.945
Whoever you are,
whatever you are here for,

32
00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.080
you are in a house of God.

33
00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.083
And He's watching you.

34
00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.451
[soft groans]

35
00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:29.997

37
00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:53.588
[hiss]

38
00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.328
[deep rumbling]

39
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.001

00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:18.145

44
00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:21.549
[screaming]

45
00:06:53.715 --> 00:06:55.249
[engine revving]

46
00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:09.631
Get this under the other tire.

47
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:17.772
[groaning]

48
00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:25.145
[all laughing]

49
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.829
[Reverend Mother] Sister Irene!
Sister Irene!

50
00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:45.132
Sister Debra.

51
00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.134
It's Sister Debra.

52
00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.235
[Reverend Mother]
<i>She's trouble.</i>

53
00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:51.104
Every day she's making trouble.

54
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.775
And now, she refused
to go to confession.

55
00:07:53.808 --> 00:07:56.511
[speaks Italian]

56
00:07:56.544 --> 00:07:58.278
[in English] And you know why?

57
00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:02.449
She did not think
she had anything to confess.

58
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.485
For that alone,
she should be confessing.

59
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.287
I will have a talk with her,
Reverend Mother.

60
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:08.590
<i>Grazie,</i> Sister.

61
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.635
Sister Debra?

62
00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.170
Sister Irene.

63
00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:26.273
This about confession?

64
00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:27.809
You're going to give the Mother
a heart attack.

65
00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:30.177
Well, then maybe
I'll have something to confess.

66
00:08:32.714 --> 00:08:34.381
[stifles laugh]

67
00:08:40.622 --> 00:08:42.122
Your father
sent you here, right?

68
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:47.227
Yes. I was different.

69
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.765
Sending me away was easier than
trying to understand who I was.

70
00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:54.267
What'd your mama
say about that?

71
00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.809
I barely remember her.

72
00:09:03.578 --> 00:09:05.780
But my father always said
I was just like her.

73
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.817
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

74
00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:18.358
Well, my family's
from Mississippi,

75
00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:20.828
but we ran into some trouble
down there.

76
00:09:20.862 --> 00:09:24.231
When I was four, white folks,
they found where we were,

77
00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:25.465
burned our house down.

78
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.505
After that,
my brothers joined the army.

79
00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:33.675
My dad figured,
"My boys can serve country,

80
00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:35.910
my daughter can serve God."

81
00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:38.980
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think

82
00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:40.748
I was gonna end up here.

83
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:46.319
Do I still have
to go to confession?

84
00:09:48.723 --> 00:09:50.290
I think
you've confessed enough.

85
00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.460
[elder sister] One by one,

86
00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.764
the sisters
found themselves murdered.

87
00:09:56.798 --> 00:10:01.569
Hanging from windows.
Throat slit open.

88
00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:03.638
Acts of suicide.

89
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:06.239
[whispers] Sometimes worse.

90
00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:09.409
They learned
that beneath their remote abbey

91
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:12.547
was a terrible secret.

92
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.415
A gateway to hell.

93
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:20.487
And from this gateway,
a demon had escaped.

94
00:10:22.523 --> 00:10:25.827
Now, we know that a demon
can take any form,

95
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.263
but they choose their form
to challenge your faith

96
00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.332
and to weaken your spirits.

97
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:38.539
Now, for the nuns
of Saint Carta,

98
00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:42.744
this demon
chose the most ungodly,

99
00:10:42.777 --> 00:10:46.514
the most blasphemous form.

100
00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:50.017
It chose
to look like one of them.

101
00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:53.721
[Sister Debra]
And then what happened?

102
00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:57.424
Well, the Vatican sent in
a pair of demon hunters.

103
00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:01.729
A priest and a nun.

104
00:11:01.763 --> 00:11:04.632
-And how did they stop it?
-[elder sister] Great question.

105
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:07.467
They used an ancient relic,

106
00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:14.307
a vial which contained
the blood of Jesus Christ.

107
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:18.513
So, they returned as heroes,
kissed the Pope's ring.

108
00:11:18.546 --> 00:11:21.314
Priest was made a bishop.

109
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.651
[sister 2]
What happened to the nun?

110
00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:26.020
[elder sister]
Well, no one really knows.

111
00:11:26.053 --> 00:11:28.856
They say the experience
was too much for her.

112
00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:33.426
Some say that she went mad.

113
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.031
The Vatican had to lock her up
in an asylum.

114
00:11:51.946 --> 00:11:54.749
[Celeste] Gotcha! Quick!

115
00:11:54.782 --> 00:11:56.684
Why does Madame
have so much wine?

116
00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:57.919
[girl] This used
to be a monastery.

117
00:11:57.952 --> 00:11:59.720
The monks were all fat drunks.

118
00:11:59.754 --> 00:12:00.855
[laughs]

119
00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:05.293
[both giggling]

120
00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:08.729
[both laughing]

121
00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:22.009
Everyone downstairs, please.
It's nearly eight o'clock.

122
00:12:22.043 --> 00:12:23.110
Come on, now.

123
00:12:25.046 --> 00:12:26.446
[indistinct chatter]

124
00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:29.784
[Celeste] I got 'em.

125
00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:33.020
Took you long enough.

126
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.514
[Madame Laurent]
Hail Mary, full of grace,

127
00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:01.582
the Lord is with thee.

128
00:13:01.616 --> 00:13:03.084
Blessed art thou among women,

129
00:13:03.117 --> 00:13:06.554
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

130
00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:09.790
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

131
00:13:09.824 --> 00:13:11.659
and at the hour
of our-- [screams]

132
00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:12.960
Jesus Christ!

133
00:13:12.994 --> 00:13:13.995
Bloody hell!

134
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.648
Kate.

135
00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:38.019
-Good morning.
-Hard at work already?

136
00:13:38.052 --> 00:13:39.086
Always.

137
00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:43.024
Good morning, Maurice.

138
00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:45.492
Captain!

139
00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:49.130
Come on now, Sophie.

140
00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:54.235
-Hi, Maurice.
-Morning.

141
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.671
-Morning, Maurice.
-Ladies.

142
00:13:56.704 --> 00:13:59.140
Hey, Maurice, do you wanna play
baseball with us today?

143
00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:00.975
Course, I do. You know what?

144
00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:04.845
I'll teach you how
to throw a knuckleball. [blows]

145
00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:07.181
-[Sophie] Maurice. Maurice.
-Oh. Captain Sophie.

146
00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.183
Lieutenant.

147
00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:12.186
I made this for you.
It's a friendship bracelet.

148
00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:13.654
Each bead represents

149
00:14:13.688 --> 00:14:14.989
a different quality
of a good friend.

150
00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.857
Wow. It's beautiful, Sophie.
Thank you.

151
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:19.827
[girls laughing]
Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo!

152
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.730
Are you proposing to
your boyfriend, little Sophie?

153
00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.269
-Give it back.
-You can't make me.

154
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.871
You're not a teacher.
You're the servant.

155
00:14:40.982 --> 00:14:42.650
Even the servant knows

156
00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:46.087
you should treat everyone
with kindness and respect.

157
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.688
[whistle blows]

158
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.058
-Girls.
-[girls] Oui, Madame.

159
00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:56.697
What do you think you're doing?
This is not a playground!

160
00:14:56.731 --> 00:14:58.733
-Get to class!
- <i>Oui,</i> Madame.

161
00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:01.736
-And you, Maurice.
-[Maurice] Mm?

162
00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:04.238
There was a cockroach
in my quarters again.

163
00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:05.673
Ah, that's unfortunate.

164
00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:08.009
It's an infestation.
It's disgusting.

165
00:15:08.042 --> 00:15:10.845
I'll tend to it right away.

166
00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:12.780
-You'd better.
-I promise.

167
00:15:14.815 --> 00:15:17.251
Captain! Captain! Wait.

168
00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:23.824
[blows]

169
00:15:27.962 --> 00:15:29.130
How did you do that?

170
00:15:29.163 --> 00:15:30.865
Skills I learned
from another life.

171
00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:33.901
How do I look?

172
00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:35.636
Come on, get to class. Come on.

[gurgling, choking continues]

188
00:18:11.192 --> 00:18:12.693
Are you okay?

-[cicadas chirping]

197
00:19:24.965 --> 00:19:26.400
[Abbess] Sister.

198
00:19:28.503 --> 00:19:30.237
You have a visitor.

199
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.831
Reverend Mother?

200
00:20:04.004 --> 00:20:05.306
[lightbulb rattles]

201
00:20:19.253 --> 00:20:20.321
[gasps]

202
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.124
Maurice?

203
00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:29.997
Save me, Sister.

204
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.999
[roars]

205
00:20:32.032 --> 00:20:34.569
-[gasping]
-Irene! It's okay. It's okay.

206
00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:36.403
You're fine. You're fine.

207
00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:38.205
Your nose.

208
00:20:58.992 --> 00:21:00.461
[Abbess] Sister Irene.

209
00:21:01.663 --> 00:21:03.197
You have a visitor.

210
00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:20.881
[footsteps approaching]

211
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.125
[Cardinal Conroy] Sister Irene.

212
00:21:31.158 --> 00:21:32.459
Your Eminence.

213
00:21:34.128 --> 00:21:35.963
[Cardinal Conroy]
There has been an incident.

214
00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:39.233
A series of them.

215
00:21:39.266 --> 00:21:42.970
Szeleste, a small village
in Hungary.

216
00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:46.473
A 90-year-old nun shot herself
on the steps of her church.

217
00:21:46.508 --> 00:21:48.543
Graz, Austria.

218
00:21:48.576 --> 00:21:50.712
A priest cut his throat open
with a rosary

219
00:21:50.745 --> 00:21:52.514
during Christmas mass.

220
00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:54.014
Edolo, Italy.

221
00:21:54.047 --> 00:21:57.217
A novitiate threw herself
out a window.

222
00:21:57.251 --> 00:21:59.420
Sound familiar?

223
00:21:59.453 --> 00:22:02.156
Just a month ago,
in Tarascon, France,

224
00:22:02.189 --> 00:22:04.626
another priest,
murdered inside his church.

225
00:22:04.659 --> 00:22:06.427
Immolated.

226
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.364
Notice a pattern?
It's moving west across Europe.

227
00:22:10.397 --> 00:22:12.567
But its origins point
to Romania.

228
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.336
-It can't be.
-The demon lives.

229
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.639
Have you spoken
with Father Burke?

230
00:22:17.672 --> 00:22:19.239
Father Burke is dead.

231
00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:23.477
-How?
-Cholera.

232
00:22:23.511 --> 00:22:25.145
[Cardinal Conroy] You are
the only person alive

233
00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:27.080
who has dealt
with something like this.

234
00:22:27.114 --> 00:22:30.250
The Church would like
<i>you</i> to investigate.

235
00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:34.421
Find out what it wants
and where it's going next.

236
00:22:35.389 --> 00:22:36.290
No.

237
00:22:38.091 --> 00:22:39.694
I'm sorry?

238
00:22:39.727 --> 00:22:42.129
I said, "No."

239
00:22:42.162 --> 00:22:44.298
-I can't do it.
-Can't, or won't?

240
00:22:44.331 --> 00:22:47.334
You don't know what happened
at Saint Carta.

241
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.102
I was lucky
to make it out alive.

242
00:22:49.136 --> 00:22:52.105
You're right. I don't know
what you faced back there.

243
00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:56.276
But in that abbey, Sister,
you performed a miracle.

244
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.245
The Church needs another.

245
00:23:08.288 --> 00:23:10.190
[whistle blows]

246
00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:16.196
[breath exhaling]

247
00:23:18.232 --> 00:23:19.734
-[Sister Debra] Here you are.
-Sister?

248
00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:22.069
Was afraid I almost hopped
on the wrong train.

249
00:23:22.102 --> 00:23:23.505
What are you doing here?

250
00:23:23.538 --> 00:23:25.339
Looking after you.

251
00:23:25.372 --> 00:23:27.609
-Someone's gotta.
-Sister, you could be expelled.

252
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.677
Why are you here?

253
00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:39.386
My mama.

254
00:23:40.822 --> 00:23:42.724
She died in the fire.

255
00:23:42.757 --> 00:23:44.391
She was my church.

256
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.429
I want to believe in miracles.

257
00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:51.164
But when I see
the priest stand up

258
00:23:51.198 --> 00:23:53.735
and say he turned the wine
into the blood of Christ,

259
00:23:53.768 --> 00:23:56.236
I mean,
it's kind of hard to believe.

260
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.639
It's an act of faith.

261
00:23:57.672 --> 00:24:00.073
He just says a bunch
of words to wine.

262
00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:04.278
The wine becomes the blood
of Christ because we believe.

263
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:06.146
The most extraordinary
parts of our faith

264
00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:08.315
are only real
because we believe in them.

265
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.451
I guess so.

266
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.388
You're not ready.

267
00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:16.624
Why?

268
00:24:16.658 --> 00:24:19.694
An entire convent of nuns died
facing this thing.

269
00:24:19.727 --> 00:24:22.630
Women who dedicated
their lives to their faith.

270
00:24:22.664 --> 00:24:24.264
Then sacrificed their lives

271
00:24:24.298 --> 00:24:25.533
because they believed
in something greater.

272
00:24:27.267 --> 00:24:28.335
You need me.

273
00:24:32.339 --> 00:24:34.776
I just hope you can find
your faith when the time comes.

274
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.752
[church bell tolling]

275
00:24:50.825 --> 00:24:53.260
[Sophie] "Why, get you gone.
Who is't that hinders you?"

276
00:24:53.293 --> 00:24:55.295
[Kate] "A foolish heart
that I leave here behind."

277
00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:56.831
[Sophie] "What, with Lysander?"

278
00:24:56.864 --> 00:24:58.566
"With Demetrius."

279
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.536
"Be not afraid. She shall not
harm thee, Helena."

280
00:25:01.569 --> 00:25:05.272
[girl] "No, sir, she shall not,
though you take her part."

281
00:25:05.305 --> 00:25:09.376
"O, when she is angry,
she is keen and shrewd.

282
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:11.713
She was a vixen
when she went to school.

283
00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:15.148
And though she be but little,
she is fierce."

284
00:25:15.182 --> 00:25:16.751
[girl 2] "Little again!

285
00:25:16.784 --> 00:25:20.755
Nothing but low and little!
Why will you suffer her--"

286
00:25:20.788 --> 00:25:23.524
Uh, let's take a break.
Fifteen minutes.

287
00:25:23.558 --> 00:25:25.593
[girl 2] I was just getting
into character.

288
00:25:25.627 --> 00:25:28.529
[girl 3] Yeah,
an awful character.

289
00:25:28.563 --> 00:25:30.397
[Kate] All right, girls.
Slowly, now.

290
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:31.666
[Maurice] Girls.

291
00:25:31.699 --> 00:25:33.668
Sweetheart,
take these to the office.

292
00:25:39.674 --> 00:25:40.742
[whispering] You're the best.

293
00:25:44.812 --> 00:25:47.180
I heard there was
a faulty cabinet in the area?

294
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.518
The latch won't open.

295
00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:51.886
-May I?
-Oh, please.

296
00:25:58.793 --> 00:26:00.561
Yeah. It's stuck.

297
00:26:00.595 --> 00:26:03.765
Can you just, please,
put a little pressure here?

298
00:26:03.798 --> 00:26:05.800
Yeah. Just here.

299
00:26:06.868 --> 00:26:08.468
All right. Thanks.

300
00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:13.875
Looks like we share
the latest fashion.

301
00:26:16.711 --> 00:26:17.679
I guess we do.

302
00:26:18.445 --> 00:26:19.479
Okay.

303
00:26:25.318 --> 00:26:26.353
[Kate] Oh!

304
00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:29.389
Voila!

305
00:26:29.423 --> 00:26:30.792
Thanks a many.

306
00:26:30.825 --> 00:26:31.893
All right.

307
00:26:33.561 --> 00:26:34.662
Okay.

308
00:26:38.298 --> 00:26:41.703
She's a great kid.
You must be proud.

309
00:26:42.937 --> 00:26:44.204
I am.

310
00:27:02.724 --> 00:27:03.725
Need some help?

311
00:27:05.593 --> 00:27:07.628
No, I'm okay.

312
00:27:07.662 --> 00:27:10.631
Relax, Sophie.
We're not going to do anything.

313
00:27:12.033 --> 00:27:13.233
Cross my heart.

314
00:27:15.803 --> 00:27:19.406
That was pretty mean
of us earlier.

315
00:27:19.439 --> 00:27:21.542
-I was a bitch.
-[girls laugh]

316
00:27:24.746 --> 00:27:25.680
It's okay.

317
00:27:26.848 --> 00:27:28.683
What are you doing after this?

318
00:27:28.716 --> 00:27:30.685
We have to go back to class.

319
00:27:30.718 --> 00:27:32.653
Not for another ten minutes.

320
00:27:32.687 --> 00:27:34.454
Do you want to have some fun?

321
00:27:36.356 --> 00:27:38.358
[indistinct chatter]

322
00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:47.935
Madame says
the chapel is off limits.

323
00:27:47.969 --> 00:27:49.003
[girl] I know.

324
00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:13.728
[wood creaking]

325
00:28:41.622 --> 00:28:42.890

[ominous music playing]

327
00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:05.613
-What are we doing here?
-Playing a game.

328
00:29:05.646 --> 00:29:08.683
It's called "Defy the Devil."

329
00:29:10.551 --> 00:29:13.788
-I don't see any devil.
-[girls scoff]

330
00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:17.390
The devil is always here.

331
00:29:17.424 --> 00:29:19.794
You're just not looking
carefully enough.

332
00:29:23.564 --> 00:29:28.903
It depends on where you stand
and when you look.

333
00:29:30.805 --> 00:29:33.574
At the right time of day...

334
00:29:33.608 --> 00:29:38.713
the sun hits the glass
at just the right angle.

335
00:29:38.746 --> 00:29:41.115
And if you're watching
carefully,

336
00:29:41.148 --> 00:29:42.950
he looks right at you.

337
00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:47.622
The rumor is, if you look away,

338
00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:52.660
the devil will appear in
the form of a monstrous goat.

339
00:29:58.766 --> 00:30:01.502
[whispering] See?
He's watching you.

340
00:30:03.771 --> 00:30:05.606
Whatever you do,

341
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.042
whatever you hear,

342
00:30:08.075 --> 00:30:09.977
don't look away.

343
00:30:31.666 --> 00:30:33.701
[deep rumble]

344
00:30:40.074 --> 00:30:42.076

Let me out!

Sophie? What's going on?
What happened?

[panting]

358
00:32:05.126 --> 00:32:07.628
Hey, hey. It's okay.

359
00:32:09.063 --> 00:32:10.097
What happened?

360
00:32:11.932 --> 00:32:13.334
What happened?

361
00:32:13.367 --> 00:32:15.836
Of course, her boyfriend comes
to her rescue.

00:32:19.306 --> 00:32:20.875
Do you think it's funny?

364
00:32:23.744 --> 00:32:24.779
[yells] Do you?

365
00:32:34.388 --> 00:32:37.558
It's okay. It's over.

366
00:32:40.394 --> 00:32:41.896
What happened in there?

367
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.632
You can tell me.

368
00:32:47.968 --> 00:32:49.570
-Nothing.
-[Kate] Sophie?

369
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.608
Why aren't you in class?

370
00:32:54.642 --> 00:32:56.210
Oh, this isn't her fault.

371
00:32:56.243 --> 00:32:57.912
The older girls
were playing some--

372
00:32:57.945 --> 00:32:59.146
I'm sorry, Mom.

373
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:02.049
Excuse us.

374
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.618
[Maurice] Sure.

375
00:33:04.652 --> 00:33:05.786
Are you all right?

376
00:33:21.702 --> 00:33:22.970
[Sister Irene] Sister Astrid?

377
00:33:23.003 --> 00:33:24.038
[Sister Astrid]
Welcome to Tarascon.

378
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:26.373
Please come in.

379
00:33:26.407 --> 00:33:30.010
We still have mass,
but no one comes.

380
00:33:30.044 --> 00:33:32.379
People believe
it was the devil.

381
00:33:32.413 --> 00:33:37.118
They say our church is cursed,
that God has abandoned us.

382
00:33:51.232 --> 00:33:52.700
This is where we found him.

383
00:33:52.733 --> 00:33:54.702
[breath exhales]

384
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.406

[creaking]

389
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.840
[Sister Debra] Sister?

390
00:35:10.978 --> 00:35:12.112
Are you okay?

391
00:35:14.815 --> 00:35:15.849
I'm fine.

392
00:35:20.354 --> 00:35:22.356
[Sister Debra] Can we see
Father Noiret's room, please?

393
00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:25.159
[Sister Astrid] Of course.

394
00:35:34.168 --> 00:35:35.069
Creepy.

395
00:35:36.403 --> 00:35:37.805
[Sister Irene] Saint Lucy.

396
00:35:37.838 --> 00:35:39.907
Patron Saint of the blind.

397
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.342
She was murdered by pagans.

398
00:35:41.375 --> 00:35:43.344
They lit her on fire,
but she wouldn't burn.

399
00:35:43.377 --> 00:35:45.846
Before killing her,
they gouged out her eyes.

400
00:35:45.879 --> 00:35:47.281
[keys rattle]

401
00:35:47.314 --> 00:35:49.850
Found them. Please.

402
00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:53.320
[lock turns]

403
00:35:58.292 --> 00:36:00.294
[traffic rumbling outside]

404
00:36:02.863 --> 00:36:05.366
There was a boy that night?
A witness?

405
00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:08.002
Yes. Jacques.
He saw everything.

406
00:36:09.103 --> 00:36:10.471
Where can we find him?

407
00:36:10.505 --> 00:36:12.940
His mother doesn't want him
talking about it.

408
00:36:14.375 --> 00:36:17.344
But you might find him
playing football in town.

409
00:36:17.378 --> 00:36:19.446
Was there anyone else
in the church?

410
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.081
We had a handyman.

411
00:36:21.115 --> 00:36:23.217
He left the day
after it happened.

412
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.119
Do you know where he went?

413
00:36:25.152 --> 00:36:27.254
I don't know.

414
00:36:27.288 --> 00:36:30.891
But he was a world traveler.
He came from Romania.

415
00:36:30.924 --> 00:36:32.594
That is where he got
his nickname.

416
00:36:32.627 --> 00:36:35.129
They used to call him...

417
00:36:35.162 --> 00:36:36.531
-"Frenchie."
-Frenchie.

418
00:36:38.932 --> 00:36:40.535
[Sister Irene] Where are you
headed next?

419
00:36:40.568 --> 00:36:43.203
Well, I have enough money
to get me to Hungary,

420
00:36:43.237 --> 00:36:45.406
and from there,
the world is my oyster.

421
00:36:46.874 --> 00:36:48.876
At least Hungary is.

422
00:36:48.909 --> 00:36:52.079
-You saved my life.
-That? That was nothing.

423
00:36:52.112 --> 00:36:55.583
No, you've just fell into a...
what do you call it? Um...

424
00:36:55.617 --> 00:36:57.017
a life debt.

425
00:36:57.585 --> 00:36:59.286
It's very simple.

426
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.524
You and I will be bound
together for all eternity.

427
00:37:04.992 --> 00:37:06.226
[train whistle blows]

428
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.861
[conductor shouting]

429
00:37:07.895 --> 00:37:09.263
[Sister Irene] I almost forgot.

430
00:37:09.296 --> 00:37:12.132
It's nothing, just a thank you.

431
00:37:16.103 --> 00:37:18.506
Tomato seeds. Thank you.

432
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.908
You said you wanted a farm
some day.

433
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:22.176
You have to start somewhere.

434
00:37:24.478 --> 00:37:27.314
-I'll miss you, Irene.
-[whistle blows]

435
00:37:27.348 --> 00:37:29.350
[conductor shouting]

436
00:37:42.262 --> 00:37:43.230
[Sister Debra] Irene?

437
00:37:45.232 --> 00:37:46.934
Who is this Frenchie guy?

438
00:37:49.002 --> 00:37:51.271
His name is Maurice.

439
00:37:51.305 --> 00:37:53.541
Back at Saint Carta,
he was our guide.

440
00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:57.911
When I faced the demon,
he came back for me.

441
00:38:00.981 --> 00:38:02.149
<i>He saved my life.</i>

442
00:38:04.952 --> 00:38:07.421
[gasps] That's when
it happened.

443
00:38:07.454 --> 00:38:09.456
[screams]

444
00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:14.662
It's how the demon escaped.

445
00:38:14.696 --> 00:38:17.965
That's how it's moving,
doing these things.

446
00:38:17.998 --> 00:38:20.200
So, he's... possessed.

447
00:38:23.303 --> 00:38:25.305
[indistinct shouting]

448
00:38:31.011 --> 00:38:31.679
[Kate] Maurice.

449
00:38:33.247 --> 00:38:35.449
Hi. Hello again.

450
00:38:37.184 --> 00:38:39.721
I realized
I never said thank you.

451
00:38:39.754 --> 00:38:42.322
-Sophie told me what you did.
-Oh. No.

452
00:38:42.356 --> 00:38:45.159
Those girls
are little monsters.

453
00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:48.295
They're not all bad. Just some.

454
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.571
Look... the chapel, why does
Madame keep it locked up?

455
00:38:56.604 --> 00:38:59.306
Uh, it's dangerous.

456
00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:02.142
Her son was killed inside
during the bombings.

457
00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:05.713
Cedric. He was an altar boy.

458
00:39:07.147 --> 00:39:08.750
I didn't know she had a son.

459
00:39:08.783 --> 00:39:10.585
She doesn't talk about it.

460
00:39:10.618 --> 00:39:14.522
Madame is a hard woman,
but she's been very good to us.

461
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:24.331
Ah. I should get back
to the children.

462
00:39:24.364 --> 00:39:27.000
Sure, yes. And I should
get back to my work.

463
00:39:32.574 --> 00:39:34.542
[indistinct chatter]

464
00:39:47.722 --> 00:39:49.022
Caught you!

465
00:39:49.824 --> 00:39:52.092
What were you doing?

466
00:39:52.125 --> 00:39:54.495
-Nothing.
-You were spying.

467
00:39:56.196 --> 00:39:58.533
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

468
00:39:58.566 --> 00:40:01.335
Maybe, probably,
absolutely definitely.

469
00:40:01.368 --> 00:40:03.538
[Sophie chuckles]

470
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:06.641
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

471
00:40:08.075 --> 00:40:10.444
It was something.
He was making you laugh.

472
00:40:11.646 --> 00:40:13.447
That is none of your business.

473
00:40:15.082 --> 00:40:18.218
Now, let's go. No more spying.

-I've been looking for you.
-Mom?

495
00:42:52.807 --> 00:42:53.675
[Kate] Quick.

496
00:42:56.844 --> 00:42:59.714
What's next?
Is this just a big dead end?

497
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:03.450
No. There's something here.

498
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.289
What? You...
You sense something?

499
00:43:10.958 --> 00:43:12.192
Something like that.

500
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.662

Hm. I'm afraid I can't find it.

What? That's not possible.
I have a reservation.

Madam, it's not here.

I saw what the demon wants.

It's powerful.

The altar boy.

613
00:57:00.755 --> 00:57:03.223

I found him.

-What?
-Well, he found me.

615
00:57:05.259 --> 00:57:07.762
He came by when you were out.
He gave me this.

618
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.150
it seems so familiar,
but I can't place it.

I can. The photos.

620
00:57:36.524 --> 00:57:38.392

on one of the victims.

If we find out what this means,

we might be able to find out
where it's headed.

Hey, it's okay to be scared.

Don't know why.
Maybe she loves you?

I've been speaking
to the Vatican.

They tell me the demon
of Saint Carta has returned.

It's a family crest.

Saint Lucy of Syracuse.

Saint Lucy?

680
01:03:02.683 --> 01:03:04.018
I think I know what it wants.

What?

682
01:03:08.488 --> 01:03:09.957

The eyes? W-What eyes?

684
01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.564
When Lucy was murdered
by pagans, her family escaped.

685
01:03:16.597 --> 01:03:17.865
They were hunted.

686
01:03:20.534 --> 01:03:22.136
Scattered across the globe.

687
01:03:22.169 --> 01:03:24.872
All this time, they've been
protecting a secret.

01:03:24.906 --> 01:03:25.940
A holy relic.

689
01:03:27.108 --> 01:03:29.043
The eyes of Saint Lucy.

690
01:03:31.913 --> 01:03:37.652
So, the demon
is after a... pair of eyes?

691
01:03:37.685 --> 01:03:41.188
-Why would it want that?
-It's a demon.

I'm just a glorified librarian,
I couldn't begin to guess.

But, if we're
sharing theories...

694
01:03:49.997 --> 01:03:54.902
you might like to consider that
this demon was once an angel.

695
01:03:58.906 --> 01:04:00.174
Rejected by God.

gave to His saints.

698
01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.682
It wants that power back.

Demons are infinite.

700
01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:11.052
It was there with Saint Lucy

701
01:04:11.085 --> 01:04:13.721
and it's been hunting
the bloodline ever since.

702
01:04:13.754 --> 01:04:16.857
This relic is an item
of great power.

703
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:19.894
In the hands of a demon,
it would be unthinkable.

704
01:04:19.927 --> 01:04:22.563
But in your hands,
it could be a weapon.

705
01:04:22.596 --> 01:04:26.033
Just as you used the blood
of Christ at Saint Carta.

706
01:04:26.067 --> 01:04:27.735
This is the way you do it.

707
01:04:29.537 --> 01:04:33.574
This is the way you send
that thing back to hell.

709
01:04:40.748 --> 01:04:41.649

We don't really know
what this relic can do.

725
01:05:37.204 --> 01:05:39.306
The same goes for the demon.

726
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.709
<i>It will take any form,</i>

727
01:05:41.742 --> 01:05:44.912

<i>to prey on your fears,</i>

728
01:05:44.945 --> 01:05:47.648

-It's called feijoada.

-It's a Portuguese stew.
-What's in it?

732

01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:15.576
And snails.

734
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:29.757
I lied to you.

About what?

736
01:06:32.426 --> 01:06:34.295
I said I didn't remember
my mother.

737
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.231
But I do.

738
01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:41.969
I remember everything
about her.

739
01:06:43.671 --> 01:06:46.173
<i>She was deeply religious.</i>

740
01:06:46.207 --> 01:06:48.409
<i>She said that God</i>
<i>spoke directly to her,</i>

741
01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:50.311
<i>that He showed her things.</i>

743
01:06:53.047 --> 01:06:53.914

744
01:06:55.216 --> 01:06:57.251
My father didn't believe her.

745
01:06:57.284 --> 01:06:58.853
He said she was insane.

746
01:07:00.921 --> 01:07:02.056
Heretical.

747
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:03.724
What happened to her?

748
01:07:04.992 --> 01:07:06.827
My father brought her
to a doctor.

749
01:07:08.963 --> 01:07:10.898
Then they came back
and took her away.
