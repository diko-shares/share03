1
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.448
-You're late, Jacques.
-Sorry, Father.

2
00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:19.749
Go fetch the wine.

3
00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:20.684
Why don't

4
00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:22.052
you go fetch the wine?

5
00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:23.720
- Pardon?
- Er, nothing.

6
00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:53.149
Let your spirit
come upon these gifts

7
00:01:53.183 --> 00:01:57.087
to make them holy
so that they may become for us,

8
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.791
the body and blood of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

9
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.064
Body of Christ.

10
00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:09.132
Amen.

11
00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:13.804
-The blood of Christ.
-Amen.

12
00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:25.535
-Father.
-Yes?

13
00:04:25.568 --> 00:04:27.303
-There's someone here.
-Where?

14
00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:03.707
Who's there?

15
00:05:05.275 --> 00:05:09.245
Whoever you are,
whatever you are here for,

16
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.380
you are in a house of God.

17
00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:13.383
And He's watching you.

18
00:07:05.428 --> 00:07:06.931
Get this under the other tire.

19
00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:39.129
Sister Irene!
Sister Irene!

20
00:07:41.464 --> 00:07:42.432
Sister Debra.

21
00:07:42.465 --> 00:07:44.434
It's Sister Debra.

22
00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:45.535
<i>She's trouble.</i>

23
00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:48.404
Every day she's making trouble.

24
00:07:48.438 --> 00:07:51.075
And now, she refused
to go to confession.

25
00:07:53.844 --> 00:07:55.578
And you know why?

26
00:07:55.612 --> 00:07:59.749
She did not think
she had anything to confess.

27
00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:02.785
For that alone,
she should be confessing.

28
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.587
I will have a talk with her,
Reverend Mother.

29
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:05.890
<i>Grazie,</i> Sister.

30
00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:17.935
Sister Debra?

31
00:08:19.069 --> 00:08:20.470
Sister Irene.

32
00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.573
This about confession?

33
00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:25.109
You're going to give the Mother
a heart attack.

34
00:08:25.142 --> 00:08:27.477
Well, then maybe
I'll have something to confess.

35
00:08:37.922 --> 00:08:39.422
Your father
sent you here, right?

36
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:44.527
Yes. I was different.

37
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.065
Sending me away was easier than
trying to understand who I was.

38
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:51.567
What'd your mama
say about that?

39
00:08:57.774 --> 00:08:59.109
I barely remember her.

40
00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:03.080
But my father always said
I was just like her.

41
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.117
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

42
00:09:11.554 --> 00:09:15.658
Well, my family's
from Mississippi,

43
00:09:15.692 --> 00:09:18.128
but we ran into some trouble
down there.

44
00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:21.531
When I was four, white folks,
they found where we were,

45
00:09:21.564 --> 00:09:22.765
burned our house down.

46
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.805
After that,
my brothers joined the army.

47
00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:30.975
My dad figured,
"My boys can serve country,

48
00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:33.210
my daughter can serve God."

49
00:09:34.777 --> 00:09:36.280
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think

50
00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:38.048
I was gonna end up here.

51
00:09:41.751 --> 00:09:43.619
Do I still have
to go to confession?

52
00:09:46.023 --> 00:09:47.590
I think
you've confessed enough.

53
00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:50.760
One by one,

54
00:09:50.793 --> 00:09:54.064
the sisters
found themselves murdered.

55
00:09:54.098 --> 00:09:58.869
Hanging from windows.
Throat slit open.

56
00:09:58.902 --> 00:10:00.938
Acts of suicide.

57
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.539
Sometimes worse.

58
00:10:03.573 --> 00:10:06.709
They learned
that beneath their remote abbey

59
00:10:06.743 --> 00:10:09.847
was a terrible secret.

60
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.715
A gateway to hell.

61
00:10:12.749 --> 00:10:17.787
And from this gateway,
a demon had escaped.

62
00:10:19.823 --> 00:10:23.127
Now, we know that a demon
can take any form,

63
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.563
but they choose their form
to challenge your faith

64
00:10:27.597 --> 00:10:29.632
and to weaken your spirits.

65
00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:35.839
Now, for the nuns
of Saint Carta,

66
00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:40.044
this demon
chose the most ungodly,

67
00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:43.814
the most blasphemous form.

68
00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:47.317
It chose
to look like one of them.

69
00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.021
And then what happened?

70
00:10:51.055 --> 00:10:54.724
Well, the Vatican sent in
a pair of demon hunters.

71
00:10:54.757 --> 00:10:59.029
A priest and a nun.

72
00:10:59.063 --> 00:11:01.932
- And how did they stop it?
- Great question.

73
00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:04.767
They used an ancient relic,

74
00:11:04.802 --> 00:11:11.607
a vial which contained
the blood of Jesus Christ.

75
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:15.813
So, they returned as heroes,
kissed the Pope's ring.

76
00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:18.614
Priest was made a bishop.

77
00:11:18.648 --> 00:11:20.951
What happened to the nun?

78
00:11:20.984 --> 00:11:23.320
Well, no one really knows.

79
00:11:23.353 --> 00:11:26.156
They say the experience
was too much for her.

80
00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:30.726
Some say that she went mad.

81
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.331
The Vatican had to lock her up
in an asylum.

82
00:11:49.246 --> 00:11:52.049
Gotcha! Quick!

83
00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:53.984
Why does Madame
have so much wine?

84
00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:55.219
This used
to be a monastery.

85
00:11:55.252 --> 00:11:57.020
The monks were all fat drunks.

86
00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:19.309
Everyone downstairs, please.
It's nearly eight o'clock.

87
00:12:19.343 --> 00:12:20.410
Come on, now.

88
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:27.084
I got 'em.

89
00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:30.320
Took you long enough.

90
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.814
Hail Mary, full of grace,

91
00:12:57.848 --> 00:12:58.882
the Lord is with thee.

92
00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:00.384
Blessed art thou among women,

93
00:13:00.417 --> 00:13:03.854
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

94
00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:07.090
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

95
00:13:07.124 --> 00:13:08.959
and at the hour
of our--

96
00:13:08.992 --> 00:13:10.260
Jesus Christ!

97
00:13:10.294 --> 00:13:11.295
Bloody hell!

98
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.948
Kate.

99
00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:35.319
-Good morning.
-Hard at work already?

100
00:13:35.352 --> 00:13:36.386
Always.

101
00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:40.324
Good morning, Maurice.

102
00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:42.792
Captain!

103
00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:46.430
Come on now, Sophie.

104
00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:51.535
-Hi, Maurice.
-Morning.

105
00:13:51.568 --> 00:13:53.971
-Morning, Maurice.
-Ladies.

106
00:13:54.004 --> 00:13:56.440
Hey, Maurice, do you wanna play
baseball with us today?

107
00:13:56.473 --> 00:13:58.275
Course, I do. You know what?

108
00:13:58.308 --> 00:14:02.145
I'll teach you how
to throw a knuckleball.

109
00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:04.481
- Maurice. Maurice.
- Oh. Captain Sophie.

110
00:14:04.514 --> 00:14:06.483
Lieutenant.

111
00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:09.486
I made this for you.
It's a friendship bracelet.

112
00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.954
Each bead represents

113
00:14:10.988 --> 00:14:12.289
a different quality
of a good friend.

114
00:14:12.322 --> 00:14:14.157
Wow. It's beautiful, Sophie.
Thank you.

115
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:17.127
Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo!

116
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.030
Are you proposing to
your boyfriend, little Sophie?

117
00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:25.569
-Give it back.
-You can't make me.

118
00:14:25.602 --> 00:14:28.171
You're not a teacher.
You're the servant.

119
00:14:38.282 --> 00:14:39.950
Even the servant knows

120
00:14:39.983 --> 00:14:43.387
you should treat everyone
with kindness and respect.

121
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.358
- Girls.
- Oui, Madame.

122
00:14:48.392 --> 00:14:53.997
What do you think you're doing?
This is not a playground!

123
00:14:54.031 --> 00:14:56.033
-Get to class!
- <i>Oui,</i> Madame.

124
00:14:56.066 --> 00:14:59.036
- And you, Maurice.
- Mm?

125
00:14:59.069 --> 00:15:01.538
There was a cockroach
in my quarters again.

126
00:15:01.571 --> 00:15:02.973
Ah, that's unfortunate.

127
00:15:03.006 --> 00:15:05.309
It's an infestation.
It's disgusting.

128
00:15:05.342 --> 00:15:08.145
I'll tend to it right away.

129
00:15:08.178 --> 00:15:10.080
-You'd better.
-I promise.

130
00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:14.551
Captain! Captain! Wait.

131
00:15:25.262 --> 00:15:26.430
How did you do that?

132
00:15:26.463 --> 00:15:28.165
Skills I learned
from another life.

133
00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:31.201
How do I look?

134
00:15:31.234 --> 00:15:32.936
Come on, get to class. Come on.

135
00:16:16.346 --> 00:16:18.648
<i>Bonjour.</i> Delivery.

136
00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:04.488
<i>Monsieur?</i>

137
00:18:08.492 --> 00:18:09.993
Are you okay?

138
00:19:22.265 --> 00:19:23.700
Sister.

139
00:19:25.803 --> 00:19:27.537
You have a visitor.

140
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.131
Reverend Mother?

141
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:21.424
Maurice?

142
00:20:25.896 --> 00:20:27.297
Save me, Sister.

143
00:20:29.332 --> 00:20:31.869
Irene! It's okay. It's okay.

144
00:20:31.902 --> 00:20:33.703
You're fine. You're fine.

145
00:20:34.504 --> 00:20:35.505
Your nose.

146
00:20:56.292 --> 00:20:57.761
Sister Irene.

147
00:20:58.963 --> 00:21:00.497
You have a visitor.

148
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.425
Sister Irene.

149
00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:29.759
Your Eminence.

150
00:21:31.428 --> 00:21:33.263
There has been an incident.

151
00:21:34.264 --> 00:21:36.533
A series of them.

152
00:21:36.566 --> 00:21:40.270
Szeleste, a small village
in Hungary.

153
00:21:40.303 --> 00:21:43.773
A 90-year-old nun shot herself
on the steps of her church.

154
00:21:43.808 --> 00:21:45.843
Graz, Austria.

155
00:21:45.876 --> 00:21:48.012
A priest cut his throat open
with a rosary

156
00:21:48.045 --> 00:21:49.814
during Christmas mass.

157
00:21:49.847 --> 00:21:51.314
Edolo, Italy.

158
00:21:51.347 --> 00:21:54.517
A novitiate threw herself
out a window.

159
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:56.720
Sound familiar?

160
00:21:56.753 --> 00:21:59.456
Just a month ago,
in Tarascon, France,

161
00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:01.926
another priest,
murdered inside his church.

162
00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:03.727
Immolated.

163
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.664
Notice a pattern?
It's moving west across Europe.

164
00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:09.867
But its origins point
to Romania.

165
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.636
-It can't be.
-The demon lives.

166
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.939
Have you spoken
with Father Burke?

167
00:22:14.972 --> 00:22:16.539
Father Burke is dead.

168
00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:20.777
-How?
-Cholera.

169
00:22:20.811 --> 00:22:22.445
You are
the only person alive

170
00:22:22.479 --> 00:22:24.380
who has dealt
with something like this.

171
00:22:24.414 --> 00:22:27.550
The Church would like
<i>you</i> to investigate.

172
00:22:27.584 --> 00:22:31.721
Find out what it wants
and where it's going next.

173
00:22:32.689 --> 00:22:33.590
No.

174
00:22:35.391 --> 00:22:36.994
I'm sorry?

175
00:22:37.027 --> 00:22:39.429
I said, "No."

176
00:22:39.462 --> 00:22:41.598
-I can't do it.
-Can't, or won't?

177
00:22:41.631 --> 00:22:44.634
You don't know what happened
at Saint Carta.

178
00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:46.402
I was lucky
to make it out alive.

179
00:22:46.436 --> 00:22:49.405
You're right. I don't know
what you faced back there.

180
00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:53.576
But in that abbey, Sister,
you performed a miracle.

181
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.545
The Church needs another.

182
00:23:15.532 --> 00:23:17.034
- Here you are.
- Sister?

183
00:23:17.067 --> 00:23:19.369
Was afraid I almost hopped
on the wrong train.

184
00:23:19.402 --> 00:23:20.805
What are you doing here?

185
00:23:20.838 --> 00:23:22.639
Looking after you.

186
00:23:22.672 --> 00:23:24.909
-Someone's gotta.
-Sister, you could be expelled.

187
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:26.977
Why are you here?

188
00:23:35.718 --> 00:23:36.686
My mama.

189
00:23:38.122 --> 00:23:40.024
She died in the fire.

190
00:23:40.057 --> 00:23:41.691
She was my church.

191
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.729
I want to believe in miracles.

192
00:23:46.763 --> 00:23:48.464
But when I see
the priest stand up

193
00:23:48.498 --> 00:23:51.035
and say he turned the wine
into the blood of Christ,

194
00:23:51.068 --> 00:23:53.536
I mean,
it's kind of hard to believe.

195
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.939
It's an act of faith.

196
00:23:54.972 --> 00:23:57.373
He just says a bunch
of words to wine.

197
00:23:57.407 --> 00:24:01.578
The wine becomes the blood
of Christ because we believe.

198
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:03.446
The most extraordinary
parts of our faith

199
00:24:03.479 --> 00:24:05.615
are only real
because we believe in them.

200
00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:08.751
I guess so.

201
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.688
You're not ready.

202
00:24:12.455 --> 00:24:13.924
Why?

203
00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:16.994
An entire convent of nuns died
facing this thing.

204
00:24:17.027 --> 00:24:19.930
Women who dedicated
their lives to their faith.

205
00:24:19.964 --> 00:24:21.564
Then sacrificed their lives

206
00:24:21.598 --> 00:24:22.833
because they believed
in something greater.

207
00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:25.635
You need me.

208
00:24:29.639 --> 00:24:32.076
I just hope you can find
your faith when the time comes.

209
00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:50.560
"Why, get you gone.
Who is't that hinders you?"

210
00:24:50.593 --> 00:24:52.595
"A foolish heart
that I leave here behind."

211
00:24:52.629 --> 00:24:54.131
"What, with Lysander?"

212
00:24:54.164 --> 00:24:55.866
"With Demetrius."

213
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.836
"Be not afraid. She shall not
harm thee, Helena."

214
00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:02.572
"No, sir, she shall not,
though you take her part."

215
00:25:02.605 --> 00:25:06.676
"O, when she is angry,
she is keen and shrewd.

216
00:25:06.709 --> 00:25:09.013
She was a vixen
when she went to school.

217
00:25:09.046 --> 00:25:12.448
And though she be but little,
she is fierce."

218
00:25:12.482 --> 00:25:14.051
"Little again!

219
00:25:14.084 --> 00:25:18.055
Nothing but low and little!
Why will you suffer her--"

220
00:25:18.088 --> 00:25:20.824
Uh, let's take a break.
Fifteen minutes.

221
00:25:20.858 --> 00:25:22.893
I was just getting
into character.

222
00:25:22.927 --> 00:25:25.829
Yeah,
an awful character.

223
00:25:25.863 --> 00:25:27.697
All right, girls.
Slowly, now.

224
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.966
Girls.

225
00:25:28.999 --> 00:25:30.968
Sweetheart,
take these to the office.

226
00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:38.042
You're the best.

227
00:25:42.112 --> 00:25:44.480
I heard there was
a faulty cabinet in the area?

228
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.818
The latch won't open.

229
00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:49.186
-May I?
-Oh, please.

230
00:25:56.093 --> 00:25:57.861
Yeah. It's stuck.

231
00:25:57.895 --> 00:26:01.065
Can you just, please,
put a little pressure here?

232
00:26:01.098 --> 00:26:03.100
Yeah. Just here.

233
00:26:04.168 --> 00:26:05.768
All right. Thanks.

234
00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:11.175
Looks like we share
the latest fashion.

235
00:26:14.011 --> 00:26:14.979
I guess we do.

236
00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:16.779
Okay.

237
00:26:22.618 --> 00:26:23.653
Oh!

238
00:26:25.189 --> 00:26:26.689
Voila!

239
00:26:26.723 --> 00:26:28.092
Thanks a many.

240
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:29.193
All right.

241
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:31.962
Okay.

242
00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:39.003
She's a great kid.
You must be proud.

243
00:26:40.237 --> 00:26:41.504
I am.

244
00:27:00.024 --> 00:27:01.025
Need some help?

245
00:27:02.893 --> 00:27:04.928
No, I'm okay.

246
00:27:04.962 --> 00:27:07.931
Relax, Sophie.
We're not going to do anything.

247
00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:10.533
Cross my heart.

248
00:27:13.103 --> 00:27:16.706
That was pretty mean
of us earlier.

249
00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:18.842
I was a bitch.

250
00:27:22.046 --> 00:27:22.980
It's okay.

251
00:27:24.148 --> 00:27:25.983
What are you doing after this?

252
00:27:26.016 --> 00:27:27.985
We have to go back to class.

253
00:27:28.018 --> 00:27:29.953
Not for another ten minutes.

254
00:27:29.987 --> 00:27:31.754
Do you want to have some fun?

255
00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:45.235
Madame says
the chapel is off limits.

256
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:46.303
I know.

257
00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:02.913
-What are we doing here?
-Playing a game.

258
00:29:02.946 --> 00:29:05.983
It's called "Defy the Devil."

259
00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:11.088
I don't see any devil.

260
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:14.690
The devil is always here.

261
00:29:14.724 --> 00:29:17.094
You're just not looking
carefully enough.

262
00:29:20.864 --> 00:29:26.203
It depends on where you stand
and when you look.

263
00:29:28.105 --> 00:29:30.874
At the right time of day...

264
00:29:30.908 --> 00:29:36.013
the sun hits the glass
at just the right angle.

265
00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:38.415
And if you're watching
carefully,

266
00:29:38.448 --> 00:29:40.250
he looks right at you.

267
00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:44.922
The rumor is, if you look away,

268
00:29:44.955 --> 00:29:49.960
the devil will appear in
the form of a monstrous goat.

269
00:29:56.066 --> 00:29:58.802
See?
He's watching you.

270
00:30:01.071 --> 00:30:02.906
Whatever you do,

271
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.342
whatever you hear,

272
00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:07.277
don't look away.

273
00:31:17.547 --> 00:31:19.082
Let me out!

274
00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:59.256
Sophie? What's going on?
What happened?

275
00:32:02.426 --> 00:32:04.928
Hey, hey. It's okay.

276
00:32:06.363 --> 00:32:07.397
What happened?

277
00:32:09.232 --> 00:32:10.634
What happened?

278
00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:13.136
Of course, her boyfriend comes
to her rescue.

279
00:32:16.606 --> 00:32:18.175
Do you think it's funny?

280
00:32:21.044 --> 00:32:22.079
Do you?

281
00:32:31.688 --> 00:32:34.858
It's okay. It's over.

282
00:32:37.694 --> 00:32:39.196
What happened in there?

283
00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.932
You can tell me.

284
00:32:45.268 --> 00:32:46.870
- Nothing.
- Sophie?

285
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.908
Why aren't you in class?

286
00:32:51.942 --> 00:32:53.510
Oh, this isn't her fault.

287
00:32:53.543 --> 00:32:55.212
The older girls
were playing some--

288
00:32:55.245 --> 00:32:56.446
I'm sorry, Mom.

289
00:32:58.281 --> 00:32:59.349
Excuse us.

290
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.918
Sure.

291
00:33:01.952 --> 00:33:03.086
Are you all right?

292
00:33:19.002 --> 00:33:20.270
Sister Astrid?

293
00:33:20.303 --> 00:33:21.338
Welcome to Tarascon.

294
00:33:21.371 --> 00:33:23.673
Please come in.

295
00:33:23.707 --> 00:33:27.310
We still have mass,
but no one comes.

296
00:33:27.344 --> 00:33:29.679
People believe
it was the devil.

297
00:33:29.713 --> 00:33:34.418
They say our church is cursed,
that God has abandoned us.

298
00:33:48.532 --> 00:33:50.000
This is where we found him.

299
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.140
Sister?

300
00:35:08.278 --> 00:35:09.412
Are you okay?

301
00:35:12.115 --> 00:35:13.149
I'm fine.

302
00:35:17.654 --> 00:35:19.656
Can we see
Father Noiret's room, please?

303
00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:22.459
Of course.

304
00:35:31.468 --> 00:35:32.369
Creepy.

305
00:35:33.703 --> 00:35:35.105
Saint Lucy.

306
00:35:35.138 --> 00:35:37.207
Patron Saint of the blind.

307
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.642
She was murdered by pagans.

308
00:35:38.675 --> 00:35:40.644
They lit her on fire,
but she wouldn't burn.

309
00:35:40.677 --> 00:35:43.146
Before killing her,
they gouged out her eyes.

310
00:35:44.614 --> 00:35:47.150
Found them. Please.

311
00:36:00.163 --> 00:36:02.666
There was a boy that night?
A witness?

312
00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:05.302
Yes. Jacques.
He saw everything.

313
00:36:06.403 --> 00:36:07.771
Where can we find him?

314
00:36:07.805 --> 00:36:10.240
His mother doesn't want him
talking about it.

315
00:36:11.675 --> 00:36:14.644
But you might find him
playing football in town.

316
00:36:14.678 --> 00:36:16.746
Was there anyone else
in the church?

317
00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.381
We had a handyman.

318
00:36:18.415 --> 00:36:20.517
He left the day
after it happened.

319
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.419
Do you know where he went?

320
00:36:22.452 --> 00:36:24.554
I don't know.

321
00:36:24.588 --> 00:36:28.191
But he was a world traveler.
He came from Romania.

322
00:36:28.224 --> 00:36:29.894
That is where he got
his nickname.

323
00:36:29.927 --> 00:36:32.429
They used to call him...

324
00:36:32.462 --> 00:36:33.831
-"Frenchie."
-Frenchie.

325
00:36:36.232 --> 00:36:37.835
Where are you
headed next?

326
00:36:37.868 --> 00:36:40.503
Well, I have enough money
to get me to Hungary,

327
00:36:40.537 --> 00:36:42.706
and from there,
the world is my oyster.

328
00:36:44.174 --> 00:36:46.176
At least Hungary is.

329
00:36:46.209 --> 00:36:49.379
-You saved my life.
-That? That was nothing.

330
00:36:49.412 --> 00:36:52.883
No, you've just fell into a...
what do you call it? Um...

331
00:36:52.917 --> 00:36:54.317
a life debt.

332
00:36:54.885 --> 00:36:56.586
It's very simple.

333
00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.824
You and I will be bound
together for all eternity.

334
00:37:05.195 --> 00:37:06.563
I almost forgot.

335
00:37:06.596 --> 00:37:09.432
It's nothing, just a thank you.

336
00:37:13.403 --> 00:37:15.806
Tomato seeds. Thank you.

337
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.208
You said you wanted a farm
some day.

338
00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:19.476
You have to start somewhere.

339
00:37:21.778 --> 00:37:24.614
I'll miss you, Irene.

340
00:37:39.562 --> 00:37:40.530
Irene?

341
00:37:42.532 --> 00:37:44.234
Who is this Frenchie guy?

342
00:37:46.302 --> 00:37:48.571
His name is Maurice.

343
00:37:48.605 --> 00:37:50.841
Back at Saint Carta,
he was our guide.

344
00:37:50.875 --> 00:37:55.211
When I faced the demon,
he came back for me.

345
00:37:58.281 --> 00:37:59.449
<i>He saved my life.</i>

346
00:38:02.252 --> 00:38:04.721
That's when
it happened.

347
00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:11.962
It's how the demon escaped.

348
00:38:11.996 --> 00:38:15.265
That's how it's moving,
doing these things.

349
00:38:15.298 --> 00:38:17.500
So, he's... possessed.

350
00:38:28.311 --> 00:38:28.979
Maurice.

351
00:38:30.547 --> 00:38:32.749
Hi. Hello again.

352
00:38:34.484 --> 00:38:37.021
I realized
I never said thank you.

353
00:38:37.054 --> 00:38:39.622
-Sophie told me what you did.
-Oh. No.

354
00:38:39.656 --> 00:38:42.459
Those girls
are little monsters.

355
00:38:42.492 --> 00:38:45.595
They're not all bad. Just some.

356
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.871
Look... the chapel, why does
Madame keep it locked up?

357
00:38:53.904 --> 00:38:56.606
Uh, it's dangerous.

358
00:38:56.639 --> 00:38:59.442
Her son was killed inside
during the bombings.

359
00:39:00.811 --> 00:39:03.013
Cedric. He was an altar boy.

360
00:39:04.447 --> 00:39:06.050
I didn't know she had a son.

361
00:39:06.083 --> 00:39:07.885
She doesn't talk about it.

362
00:39:07.918 --> 00:39:11.822
Madame is a hard woman,
but she's been very good to us.

363
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:21.631
Ah. I should get back
to the children.

364
00:39:21.664 --> 00:39:24.300
Sure, yes. And I should
get back to my work.

365
00:39:45.022 --> 00:39:46.322
Caught you!

366
00:39:47.124 --> 00:39:49.392
What were you doing?

367
00:39:49.425 --> 00:39:51.795
-Nothing.
-You were spying.

368
00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:55.833
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

369
00:39:55.866 --> 00:39:58.635
Maybe, probably,
absolutely definitely.

370
00:40:00.871 --> 00:40:03.941
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

371
00:40:05.375 --> 00:40:07.744
It was something.
He was making you laugh.

372
00:40:08.946 --> 00:40:10.747
That is none of your business.

373
00:40:12.382 --> 00:40:15.518
Now, let's go. No more spying.

374
00:40:21.558 --> 00:40:22.827
Hey!

375
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:34.872
Sophie?

376
00:40:40.777 --> 00:40:41.778
Mom?

377
00:40:56.492 --> 00:40:57.360
Mom?

378
00:41:17.714 --> 00:41:18.681
Mom?

379
00:41:45.976 --> 00:41:47.111
Mom?

380
00:42:35.792 --> 00:42:38.195
Come on now, girls. Quick.
Quickly.

381
00:42:38.228 --> 00:42:39.662
<i>Vite! Vite!</i>

382
00:42:42.866 --> 00:42:44.667
Sophie!

383
00:42:44.701 --> 00:42:46.536
Where did you run off to?

384
00:42:46.569 --> 00:42:48.671
-I've been looking for you.
-Mom?

385
00:42:50.107 --> 00:42:50.975
Quick.

386
00:42:54.144 --> 00:42:57.014
What's next?
Is this just a big dead end?

387
00:42:58.849 --> 00:43:00.750
No. There's something here.

388
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.589
What? You...
You sense something?

389
00:43:08.258 --> 00:43:09.492
Something like that.

390
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.962
My Sisters.

391
00:43:11.996 --> 00:43:12.930
I have
a reservation,

392
00:43:12.963 --> 00:43:14.231
under Irene Palmer.

393
00:43:14.264 --> 00:43:15.665
Palmer?

394
00:43:16.967 --> 00:43:19.970
Hm. I'm afraid I can't find it.

395
00:43:20.004 --> 00:43:23.506
What? That's not possible.
I have a reservation.

396
00:43:24.674 --> 00:43:26.542
Madam, it's not here.

397
00:43:26.576 --> 00:43:28.045
Let me just take care of it.

398
00:43:28.078 --> 00:43:30.613
Um, sir, can we please speak
to a manager?

399
00:43:31.949 --> 00:43:33.250
- Certainly, madam.
- Thank you.

400
00:43:37.321 --> 00:43:39.756
<i>Vite! Vite!</i>

401
00:43:58.342 --> 00:43:59.209
Jacques?

402
00:44:09.053 --> 00:44:10.120
You're the boy.

403
00:44:13.157 --> 00:44:15.192
Don't be scared.
My name's Irene.

404
00:44:15.225 --> 00:44:16.759
The Church sent me to help.

405
00:44:16.793 --> 00:44:18.694
I know you were there
that night.

406
00:44:19.662 --> 00:44:20.797
You saw it.

407
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.744
That night,
did you have a rosary?

408
00:44:34.777 --> 00:44:37.347
No. It was Father Noiret's.

409
00:44:37.381 --> 00:44:39.983
-What?
-I took it.

410
00:44:40.017 --> 00:44:41.285
I'm sorry, I was scared.

411
00:44:53.197 --> 00:44:55.099
Jacques! Wait!

412
00:45:25.996 --> 00:45:27.030
Jacques?

413
00:49:21.465 --> 00:49:22.999
Irene?

414
00:49:24.935 --> 00:49:25.902
Irene!

415
00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:32.376
Irene! Irene!

416
00:49:32.409 --> 00:49:35.212
Irene, wake up!
Oh, my God. Wake up.

417
00:49:35.245 --> 00:49:37.981
- We need a doctor.
- Help! Help!

418
00:49:38.014 --> 00:49:40.951
Somebody help! I need a doctor!

419
00:49:42.185 --> 00:49:43.186
Irene.

420
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.355
Somebody help!

421
00:49:59.102 --> 00:50:02.372
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

422
00:50:02.406 --> 00:50:04.274
Blessed are thou among women--

423
00:51:08.438 --> 00:51:09.439
Maurice?

424
00:51:30.193 --> 00:51:31.261
Maurice.

425
00:51:41.538 --> 00:51:42.572
Madame Laurent?

426
00:51:43.573 --> 00:51:45.509
What are you doing?

427
00:51:45.542 --> 00:51:47.377
I don't know.
I don't know.

428
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.646
-I don't know.
-Go back to your room.

429
00:51:49.679 --> 00:51:50.447
Yes.

430
00:51:52.516 --> 00:51:55.185
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

431
00:51:55.218 --> 00:51:56.753
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

432
00:51:56.786 --> 00:51:59.456
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

433
00:52:08.833 --> 00:52:10.133
Mama!

434
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:22.172
Who is in here?

435
00:54:00.377 --> 00:54:01.511
Cedric?

436
00:55:12.415 --> 00:55:13.717
Cedric.

437
00:55:27.965 --> 00:55:28.966
Stop!

438
00:55:56.493 --> 00:55:58.963
There she is,
back from the dead.

439
00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:03.000
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome, Sister.

440
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:09.874
What happened last night?

441
00:56:18.581 --> 00:56:20.851
We're close.

442
00:56:20.885 --> 00:56:23.954
I had a vision.
I saw what the demon wants.

443
00:56:25.755 --> 00:56:28.358
It's powerful.

444
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:31.294
Some coveted prize,
some ancient relic.

445
00:56:34.464 --> 00:56:36.033
It's been using Maurice
to get it.

446
00:56:38.434 --> 00:56:39.702
<i>Driving him.</i>

447
00:56:40.938 --> 00:56:43.573
<i>Draining him.</i>

448
00:56:43.606 --> 00:56:46.877
<i>Keeping him alive</i>
<i>just to find this thing.</i>

449
00:56:48.678 --> 00:56:50.580
It's going to kill him
when it's done.

450
00:56:55.585 --> 00:56:58.022
The altar boy.

451
00:56:58.055 --> 00:57:00.523
I-I forgot to tell you,
I found him.

452
00:57:00.557 --> 00:57:02.525
-What?
-Well, he found me.

453
00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:05.062
He came by when you were out.
He gave me this.

454
00:57:16.739 --> 00:57:17.975
Father Noiret's rosary.

455
00:57:21.544 --> 00:57:22.947
The symbol, it...

456
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:27.450
it seems so familiar,
but I can't place it.

457
00:57:27.483 --> 00:57:29.452
I can. The photos.

458
00:57:33.824 --> 00:57:35.692
I think I saw that
on one of the victims.

459
00:57:36.426 --> 00:57:37.427
Look.

460
00:57:38.128 --> 00:57:39.596
It's a connection.

461
00:57:47.637 --> 00:57:49.073
If we find out what this means,

462
00:57:49.106 --> 00:57:50.941
we might be able to find out
where it's headed.

463
00:57:50.975 --> 00:57:52.742
How are we gonna do that?

464
00:57:54.178 --> 00:57:56.180
I have a friend
in the Catholic archives.

465
00:59:02.813 --> 00:59:05.581
I can't find Sophie.
Have you seen her?

466
00:59:06.749 --> 00:59:08.852
No, I...

467
00:59:08.886 --> 00:59:12.056
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry. She can't be far.

468
00:59:12.089 --> 00:59:13.523
I'll find her, all right?

469
00:59:14.757 --> 00:59:15.792
Sophie!

470
00:59:28.005 --> 00:59:29.173
Sophie!

471
00:59:54.064 --> 00:59:55.132
Sophie.

472
00:59:58.735 --> 00:59:59.736
Hey.

473
01:00:05.742 --> 01:00:07.978
This is quite
a spot you've got.

474
01:00:08.012 --> 01:00:09.079
May I join you?

475
01:00:10.981 --> 01:00:12.116
What for?

476
01:00:13.716 --> 01:00:14.784
Just to talk.

477
01:00:26.363 --> 01:00:28.631
Madame never went
into the chapel.

478
01:00:30.234 --> 01:00:32.602
I don't know why
she went in there last night.

479
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.008
There's something wrong
with this school.

480
01:00:39.776 --> 01:00:42.112
There's something
that doesn't feel right.

481
01:00:44.915 --> 01:00:46.749
It's like
there's something here...

482
01:00:48.684 --> 01:00:50.154
that's not meant to be.

483
01:00:52.823 --> 01:00:53.824
Sophie?

484
01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.593
What happened?

485
01:00:58.795 --> 01:01:00.998
Did you see something?
Anything?

486
01:01:01.932 --> 01:01:03.033
N-no.

487
01:01:05.735 --> 01:01:07.137
It's just a feeling.

488
01:01:09.139 --> 01:01:12.142
Hey, it's okay to be scared.

489
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:16.046
I'm scared, too.

490
01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.781
There's been times in my life

491
01:01:18.816 --> 01:01:21.218
where fear has
made me do things

492
01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:22.986
I never thought possible.

493
01:01:27.124 --> 01:01:29.326
You kept my bracelet.

494
01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:32.728
Yeah, well, I tried to sell it.
No one would buy it.

495
01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:38.668
Come on,
we should head back down.

496
01:01:38.701 --> 01:01:40.736
Your mother is worried, okay?

497
01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:43.739
She's always worried.

498
01:01:43.773 --> 01:01:46.376
Don't know why.
Maybe she loves you?

499
01:01:48.744 --> 01:01:51.849
Come on. I just hope
she doesn't ground you.

500
01:02:10.766 --> 01:02:13.403
-Excuse us.
-I'm so sorry. God bless you.

501
01:02:28.784 --> 01:02:29.953
<i>Where did</i>
<i>you find it?</i>

502
01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:31.754
<i>Tarascon.</i>

503
01:02:31.787 --> 01:02:34.057
-This belonged to the priest?
-Yes, how did you know?

504
01:02:34.091 --> 01:02:35.859
I've been speaking
to the Vatican.

505
01:02:35.893 --> 01:02:38.862
They tell me the demon
of Saint Carta has returned.

506
01:02:40.264 --> 01:02:41.965
It's a family crest.

507
01:02:41.999 --> 01:02:43.066
Whose family?

508
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:49.306
Saint Lucy of Syracuse.

509
01:02:49.339 --> 01:02:52.209
These victims
must be her descendants.

510
01:02:52.242 --> 01:02:53.243
Saint Lucy?

511
01:02:59.983 --> 01:03:01.318
I think I know what it wants.

512
01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.687
What?

513
01:03:05.788 --> 01:03:07.257
The eyes.

514
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:10.327
The eyes? W-What eyes?

515
01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.864
When Lucy was murdered
by pagans, her family escaped.

516
01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:15.165
They were hunted.

517
01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:19.436
Scattered across the globe.

518
01:03:19.469 --> 01:03:22.172
All this time, they've been
protecting a secret.

519
01:03:22.206 --> 01:03:23.240
A holy relic.

520
01:03:24.408 --> 01:03:26.343
The eyes of Saint Lucy.

521
01:03:29.213 --> 01:03:34.952
So, the demon
is after a... pair of eyes?

522
01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:38.488
-Why would it want that?
-It's a demon.

523
01:03:38.522 --> 01:03:42.059
I'm just a glorified librarian,
I couldn't begin to guess.

524
01:03:43.327 --> 01:03:47.264
But, if we're
sharing theories...

525
01:03:47.297 --> 01:03:52.202
you might like to consider that
this demon was once an angel.

526
01:03:56.206 --> 01:03:57.474
Rejected by God.

527
01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:00.277
Stripped of his holy power

528
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:03.046
that God so casually
gave to His saints.

529
01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.982
It wants that power back.

530
01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:06.850
Demons are infinite.

531
01:04:06.883 --> 01:04:08.352
It was there with Saint Lucy

532
01:04:08.385 --> 01:04:11.021
and it's been hunting
the bloodline ever since.

533
01:04:11.054 --> 01:04:14.157
This relic is an item
of great power.

534
01:04:14.191 --> 01:04:17.194
In the hands of a demon,
it would be unthinkable.

535
01:04:17.227 --> 01:04:19.863
But in your hands,
it could be a weapon.

536
01:04:19.896 --> 01:04:23.333
Just as you used the blood
of Christ at Saint Carta.

537
01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:25.035
This is the way you do it.

538
01:04:26.837 --> 01:04:30.874
This is the way you send
that thing back to hell.

539
01:04:34.478 --> 01:04:36.013
We just don't know where it is.

540
01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:38.949
I might.

541
01:04:40.384 --> 01:04:42.052
We've been
cataloguing these relics,

542
01:04:42.085 --> 01:04:43.987
chasing down rumors and so on,

543
01:04:44.021 --> 01:04:45.555
and if my memory
serves me correct,

544
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:47.891
this one found its way
to a monk.

545
01:04:49.593 --> 01:04:51.528
Jean-Paul Redar.

546
01:04:51.561 --> 01:04:54.231
According to letters
that he wrote to the Vatican,

547
01:04:54.264 --> 01:04:57.434
he buried the eyes
somewhere within his monastery.

548
01:04:57.467 --> 01:05:01.371
Saint Mary's, Aix-en-Provence.

549
01:05:01.405 --> 01:05:05.008
-It's about an hour from here.
-Is it still a monastery?

550
01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:10.013
No, it was sold to a winery
and now...

551
01:05:13.283 --> 01:05:14.584
it's a boarding school.

552
01:05:27.264 --> 01:05:31.968
Irene, wait. Whatever happens
tonight, don't hesitate.

553
01:05:32.002 --> 01:05:34.471
We don't really know
what this relic can do.

554
01:05:34.504 --> 01:05:36.606
The same goes for the demon.

555
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.009
<i>It will take any form,</i>

556
01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:42.212
<i>and it will choose its form</i>
<i>to prey on your fears,</i>

557
01:05:42.245 --> 01:05:44.948
<i>and the fears</i>
<i>of those around you.</i>

558
01:05:44.981 --> 01:05:48.585
<i>You must be prepared</i>
<i>to stop it, at all costs.</i>

559
01:06:00.397 --> 01:06:03.266
-What are you making?
-It's called feijoada.

560
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.036
-It's a Portuguese stew.
-What's in it?

561
01:06:09.072 --> 01:06:10.073
Slugs.

562
01:06:11.675 --> 01:06:12.876
And snails.

563
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:27.057
I lied to you.

564
01:06:28.392 --> 01:06:29.693
About what?

565
01:06:29.726 --> 01:06:31.595
I said I didn't remember
my mother.

566
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:34.531
But I do.

567
01:06:37.467 --> 01:06:39.269
I remember everything
about her.

568
01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:43.473
<i>She was deeply religious.</i>

569
01:06:43.507 --> 01:06:45.709
<i>She said that God</i>
<i>spoke directly to her,</i>

570
01:06:45.742 --> 01:06:47.611
<i>that He showed her things.</i>

571
01:06:47.644 --> 01:06:48.612
<i>Visions.</i>

572
01:06:50.347 --> 01:06:51.214
Like me.

573
01:06:52.516 --> 01:06:54.551
My father didn't believe her.

574
01:06:54.584 --> 01:06:56.153
He said she was insane.

575
01:06:58.221 --> 01:06:59.356
Heretical.

576
01:06:59.389 --> 01:07:01.024
What happened to her?

577
01:07:02.292 --> 01:07:04.127
My father brought her
to a doctor.

578
01:07:06.263 --> 01:07:08.198
Then they came back
and took her away.

579
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:10.600
I will always be with you.

580
01:07:15.138 --> 01:07:16.440
I never saw her again.

581
01:07:29.252 --> 01:07:30.320
Wow!

582
01:07:32.322 --> 01:07:34.057
You always turn, make me turn.

583
01:07:41.264 --> 01:07:42.165
My lady.

584
01:07:45.268 --> 01:07:46.970
Mom, it's your turn.

585
01:07:49.339 --> 01:07:51.041
No, I shouldn't.

586
01:07:51.074 --> 01:07:52.142
Please?

587
01:07:56.646 --> 01:07:57.581
Please?

588
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:01.651
All right.

589
01:09:00.143 --> 01:09:01.278
Are you all right?

590
01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.750
Yeah. It's... It's nothing.

591
01:09:06.783 --> 01:09:08.418
-Okay.
-It's nothing.

592
01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:13.390
Maurice!

593
01:09:35.312 --> 01:09:37.380
There's
something under your skin.

594
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:55.131
Oh, no.

595
01:09:59.269 --> 01:10:01.839
Come on! Come on!
We've gotta go! Come on!

596
01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.616
This way! This way! Come on!

597
01:10:17.888 --> 01:10:19.789
God! Sister.

598
01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:21.191
Maurice!

599
01:10:22.459 --> 01:10:24.694
It's back. It's here.

600
01:10:24.728 --> 01:10:26.596
- Maurice, I need you to--
- Kate, this is Irene.

601
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:28.866
-No, Maurice, no, you need to--
-She's my friend.

602
01:10:28.899 --> 01:10:31.201
- We've got to go.
- Get away from them!

603
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:34.337
What?

604
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.274
We need to go, now!

605
01:10:38.308 --> 01:10:41.478
- It's you.
- What?

606
01:10:43.346 --> 01:10:44.849
It's inside of you.

607
01:10:47.918 --> 01:10:49.786
No.

608
01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.822
- No.
- It's my fault.

609
01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:54.190
Because you came back for me,
that's when it happened.

610
01:10:56.393 --> 01:10:59.295
Oh, god! No!

611
01:11:01.765 --> 01:11:04.802
-Maurice, what's happening?
-We can stop it.

612
01:11:31.394 --> 01:11:32.930
Hello, Sister.

613
01:11:45.742 --> 01:11:46.776
Maurice?

614
01:11:54.551 --> 01:11:56.586
Irene, are you okay?

615
01:11:56.619 --> 01:11:57.654
Stop him.

616
01:12:14.537 --> 01:12:16.439
Out, demon!

617
01:12:17.942 --> 01:12:20.543
In the name of God
and the Holy Spirit,

618
01:12:20.577 --> 01:12:22.746
I command you, leave this man!

619
01:12:28.485 --> 01:12:29.753
Let him be!

620
01:12:55.445 --> 01:12:56.646
You think that'll hold him?

621
01:13:00.818 --> 01:13:01.718
Let's work quick.

622
01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:09.860
- Are you two okay?
- What was that?

623
01:13:09.894 --> 01:13:12.362
- What's wrong with him?
- He's... sick.

624
01:13:12.395 --> 01:13:14.832
We're going to help him,
but we need your help.

625
01:13:14.865 --> 01:13:16.666
He was headed
in that direction.

626
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.601
What's in there?

627
01:13:19.804 --> 01:13:20.838
That's the chapel.

628
01:13:25.742 --> 01:13:27.544
What are you
looking for?

629
01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:28.946
It's an ancient relic

630
01:13:28.979 --> 01:13:32.116
left here by a monk
named Jean-Paul Redar.

631
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:34.885
- Ring any bells?
- I'm just a teacher.

632
01:13:34.919 --> 01:13:36.821
No one's even allowed in here.

633
01:13:36.854 --> 01:13:39.857
Redar would have left some way
for the descendants to find it.

634
01:13:44.427 --> 01:13:45.628
What are you looking at?

635
01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:54.771
The goat.

636
01:13:56.506 --> 01:13:57.674
It's the devil.

637
01:13:59.609 --> 01:14:02.079
It's just a game the kids play.

638
01:14:02.112 --> 01:14:03.713
What kind of game?

639
01:14:03.746 --> 01:14:05.615
The sun shines
through the window,

640
01:14:05.648 --> 01:14:07.483
and it makes the goat's eyes
glow red.

641
01:14:10.553 --> 01:14:12.890
It's the devil. It watches you.

642
01:14:30.707 --> 01:14:31.774
Just there.

643
01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.858
Anything?

644
01:14:47.892 --> 01:14:49.759
No, not yet.

645
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.797
You're a little high.
Can you go lower?

646
01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.837
Wait. Wait, wait!

647
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.437
Go back up slowly.

648
01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:06.676
Stop!

649
01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:12.782
That's it.

650
01:15:35.738 --> 01:15:36.606
We got it.

651
01:15:37.875 --> 01:15:38.943
We got it!

652
01:16:16.013 --> 01:16:16.880
Sophie?

653
01:16:43.639 --> 01:16:45.275
Sophie?

654
01:17:06.096 --> 01:17:08.832
Celeste,
did you hear that?

655
01:17:13.871 --> 01:17:15.305
There's someone upstairs.

656
01:17:19.276 --> 01:17:20.177
Go take a look.

657
01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:10.760
Wait.

658
01:18:10.793 --> 01:18:11.895
Wait!

659
01:18:39.289 --> 01:18:40.756
The eyes of Saint Lucy.

660
01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:18.428
-Hi.
-Who are you?

661
01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:20.197
It's okay,
I'm a friend of Kate's.

662
01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:24.734
I think
there's someone upstairs.

663
01:19:49.126 --> 01:19:50.194
What the hell?

664
01:20:13.150 --> 01:20:14.218
What are you doing?

665
01:20:14.251 --> 01:20:15.219
Who's that?

666
01:20:21.058 --> 01:20:22.392
What is that thing?

667
01:20:26.063 --> 01:20:27.231
It's the devil.

668
01:20:57.461 --> 01:20:58.362
The girls!

669
01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:08.771
Mom! Mom!

670
01:24:24.401 --> 01:24:25.635
What's she doing?

671
01:24:28.205 --> 01:24:29.539
It's Madame Laurent.

672
01:24:29.573 --> 01:24:31.408
What?

673
01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:33.743
She's standing in her room.

674
01:24:41.585 --> 01:24:43.353
No! No!

675
01:25:27.797 --> 01:25:28.732
Sophie?

676
01:25:32.569 --> 01:25:35.605
Sophie, it's me, Maurice.

677
01:25:38.475 --> 01:25:41.111
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.

678
01:25:50.754 --> 01:25:53.590
Sophie! Sophie!

679
01:26:02.198 --> 01:26:03.801
Sophie.

680
01:26:13.143 --> 01:26:17.080
I would never hurt you.

681
01:26:17.882 --> 01:26:20.283
Remember, Captain?

682
01:26:53.683 --> 01:26:54.651
The eyes.

683
01:29:22.099 --> 01:29:24.300
Sophie!

684
01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.976
Sophie!

685
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:47.791
-Sophie!
-Irene!

686
01:29:49.492 --> 01:29:50.794
Are you okay?

687
01:29:50.828 --> 01:29:51.929
I have it.

688
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:01.771
Demon!

689
01:30:05.642 --> 01:30:06.776
Irene!

690
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:14.751
Be gone!

691
01:30:19.123 --> 01:30:20.623
You're hurting him!

692
01:30:24.962 --> 01:30:26.462
Sister, please.

693
01:30:27.564 --> 01:30:28.665
It's killing me.

694
01:30:37.607 --> 01:30:39.442
No!

695
01:30:48.919 --> 01:30:50.453
No!

696
01:32:02.725 --> 01:32:03.793
Where's Sophie?

697
01:32:44.902 --> 01:32:45.936
Stay close.

698
01:33:26.642 --> 01:33:27.811
Up, up!

699
01:33:29.346 --> 01:33:31.514
Go, go!

700
01:33:32.682 --> 01:33:34.151
The doors! The doors!

701
01:33:39.923 --> 01:33:41.791
Save me, oh God, by thy name.

702
01:33:43.327 --> 01:33:44.962
No!

703
01:34:18.761 --> 01:34:20.763
Get that plank!

704
01:34:38.714 --> 01:34:41.385
Get back in the chapel!
Simone, come with me.

705
01:34:53.964 --> 01:34:55.866
Stay behind me.

706
01:35:23.894 --> 01:35:24.794
No!

707
01:35:36.373 --> 01:35:38.175
<i>I will always</i>
<i>be with you.</i>

708
01:35:44.915 --> 01:35:46.049
<i>Look at me.</i>

709
01:36:13.243 --> 01:36:15.045
Are you okay?

710
01:36:15.078 --> 01:36:17.214
-Yes.
-That was a miracle.

711
01:36:24.454 --> 01:36:25.455
The wine.

712
01:36:30.894 --> 01:36:33.463
Sophie! Sophie!

713
01:36:42.139 --> 01:36:46.143
-Irene!
-No. No, Maurice, no!

714
01:36:49.479 --> 01:36:50.347
No!

715
01:36:52.883 --> 01:36:55.751
Maurice, no! No!

716
01:36:57.221 --> 01:36:58.822
Help me!

717
01:36:58.855 --> 01:37:01.791
Stop!

718
01:37:01.825 --> 01:37:02.893
Sister.

719
01:37:04.294 --> 01:37:05.462
Pray with me.

720
01:37:15.539 --> 01:37:18.275
This is the cup
of my blood.

721
01:37:18.308 --> 01:37:19.843
<i>When Lucy was murdered,</i>

722
01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:21.445
<i>her family escaped.</i>

723
01:37:21.478 --> 01:37:24.548
<i>They were hunted,</i>
<i>scattered across the globe.</i>

724
01:37:24.581 --> 01:37:28.185
The blood of the new
and everlasting covenant.

725
01:37:28.218 --> 01:37:30.354
That will be shed for you
and for all

726
01:37:30.387 --> 01:37:33.789
so that your sins
may be forgiven.

727
01:37:33.824 --> 01:37:35.158
<i>I said</i>
<i>I didn't remember my mother,</i>

728
01:37:35.192 --> 01:37:36.493
<i>but I do.</i>

729
01:37:36.526 --> 01:37:38.895
Saint Lucy,
Patron Saint of the blind.

730
01:37:38.929 --> 01:37:40.831
<i>They lit her on fire,</i>
<i>but she wouldn't burn.</i>

731
01:37:40.864 --> 01:37:43.533
Do this in memory of me.

732
01:37:43.567 --> 01:37:45.836
<i>These victims</i>
<i>must be her descendants.</i>

733
01:37:48.572 --> 01:37:49.973
You have my eyes.

734
01:37:56.947 --> 01:37:58.348
Amen.

735
01:39:32.542 --> 01:39:34.010
Sister...

736
01:39:37.247 --> 01:39:38.648
you saved me.

737
01:41:00.797 --> 01:41:02.032
Maurice.

738
01:41:23.653 --> 01:41:25.555
I'm sorry.

739
01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:29.059
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

740
01:41:31.595 --> 01:41:32.496
I'm sorry.

741
01:44:30.373 --> 01:44:32.542
<i>Mr. Warren?</i>

742
01:44:32.575 --> 01:44:33.677
<i>Mr. Warren?</i>

743
01:44:34.678 --> 01:44:35.880
<i>It's Father Gordon.</i>

744
01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:39.215
He says it's an emergency.

745
01:44:46.289 --> 01:44:47.390
Yes, Father.

746
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:49.592
How can we help?
