00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.721
If anyone finds this...

2
00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:19.016
...it means my plan...
<i>- Check that one across the hall.</i>

3
00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:21.018
...didn't work...

4
00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:23.896
...and I'm already dead.

5
00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.815
<i>- Evan?
- I think he's in here.</i>

6
00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:31.028
But if I can somehow
go back to the beginning...

7
00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:33.822
...of all of this, I might be able...
<i>- Evan!</i>

8
00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.327
...to save her.

9
00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:40.162
<i>Evan!</i>

10
00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:28.378
Evan!

11
00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.218
We're gonna be late again.

12
00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:37.596
When did you ever care about
getting to school on time?

13
00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:40.141
We're putting up pictures for parents' night.

14
00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:43.144
Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time.

15
00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:46.772
Is Dad gonna come?

16
00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.649
You know the answer to that.

17
00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:50.985
Can't he just come out for one day?

18
00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:52.862
We've been over this a hundred times.

19
00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:54.905
It's too dangerous for him.

20
00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:57.158
But Lenny said his dad's coming...

21
00:02:57.324 --> 00:02:59.160
...and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad-

22
00:02:59.368 --> 00:03:01.871
Okay, I get the point.

23
00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:04.540
But I'm not so bad, am I?

24
00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:06.542
No.

25
00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:21.141
Okay, have a great day.

26
00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:24.811
I love you. I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.

27
00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:27.981
Bye.

28
00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:31.318
Bye!

29
00:03:34.988 --> 00:03:36.823
Mrs. Treborn, I need to speak with you.

30
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.076
Can it wait till tonight? I'm late for work-

31
00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:41.745
I think you really need to see this.

32
00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:45.415
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.

33
00:03:45.582 --> 00:03:48.752
Don't make me send you
to Mr. Voytek's office.

34
00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:53.381
I was gonna show this to the principal,
but I thought I should talk to you first.

35
00:03:53.548 --> 00:03:54.591
What is it?

36
00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:58.345
I had all the children make drawings of
what they wanted to be when they grew up.

37
00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:02.141
Most of them made drawings
of what their parents did, but this...

38
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:13.486
I don't understand.

39
00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:17.114
Evan did this?

40
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.494
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.

41
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.955
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs. Treborn...

42
00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:26.874
- ...I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?

43
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.085
When I asked Evan about the drawing...

44
00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:33.047
...well, he couldn't remember doing it.

45
00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.143
I don't wanna go.

46
00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:46.854
I don't like this place, Mom.

47
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.106
I think it's creepy.

48
00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:52.818
I promise I won't make
any bad pictures. I promise.

49
00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:54.695
You're gonna be fine, okay?

50
00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:57.531
He just wants to do
a couple tests, that's all.

51
00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:00.033
- Oh...
- You'll like him.

52
00:05:03.328 --> 00:05:05.789
That's good. You're doing great.

53
00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:09.042
Just tell me he hasn't inherited
his father's illness.

54
00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.670
I'm sure the test results
will come back negative.

55
00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:14.172
But there's something else you can do
to monitor his memory.

56
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:17.050
- Anything.
- A journal.

57
00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.428
Just have him write down
everything that he does.

58
00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:22.306
- And what will that do?
- It <i>could</i> help jog his memory.

59
00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:25.893
See if he remembers
anything new the next day.

60
00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.062
These test results
will come back in a few days...

61
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:29.814
- ...and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.

62
00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:34.444
<i>Today Mommy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.</i>

63
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.572
<i>I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.</i>

64
00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.702
Great, see you soon.

65
00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:56.174
Evan.

66
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:59.344
Evan, what are you doing
with that knife?

67
00:06:07.852 --> 00:06:09.687
What happened?

68
00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:11.607
Honey...

69
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.360
...what were you doing with that knife?

70
00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:18.280
I don't remember.

71
00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:32.211
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.

72
00:06:32.378 --> 00:06:33.837
Hello, little man.

73
00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:36.590
Watch your step.

74
00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:42.429
Uh, thanks, George.

75
00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:45.349
- Not a problem.
- Here's my number at the hospital...

76
00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:47.184
...in case there are any problems.

77
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:50.688
And, urn, please, um,
keep an eye on him because...

78
00:06:50.896 --> 00:06:53.607
Are you kidding? We're gonna have
a great time today, right, sport?

79
00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:57.153
Okay, be good, kiddo. I love you.

80
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.155
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.

81
00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:03.994
Go long. Go on.
Right in the back yard. Here it comes.

82
00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:09.416
Evan, Evan, guess what.
Dad got a new video camera...

83
00:07:09.582 --> 00:07:11.126
...and we're all gonna be in a movie.

84
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:13.253
That's right, Evan.

85
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.631
And you get to be the star.

86
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.676
- I thought I was the star.
- Hey, what did I tell you?

87
00:07:21.678 --> 00:07:22.804
Now, Evan...

88
00:07:23.013 --> 00:07:25.015
...you have to promise...

89
00:07:25.181 --> 00:07:28.893
...your bestest, super-duper promise...

90
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.188
...that this will be our little secret.

91
00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:34.566
- Think you can do that?
- Uh-huh.

92
00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:37.193
I'm r-

93
00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:46.579
Where am I? Where did we all go?

94
00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:50.708
- Calm down, kid, stand still.
- I was just somewhere else.

95
00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:52.335
How did I get here?

96
00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:55.421
Quit acting like some damn retard,
or I'll call your mother...

97
00:07:55.588 --> 00:07:58.007
...and tell her what a naughty
little shit you've been.

98
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:02.136
Kayleigh.

99
00:08:03.054 --> 00:08:04.347
Kayleigh.

100
00:08:05.514 --> 00:08:06.807
What happened?

101
00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:19.528
The good news is the results are negative.

102
00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:22.949
I found no evidence of lesions,
hemorrhaging, tumors.

103
00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:25.285
But you must have
something you can go on.

104
00:08:25.452 --> 00:08:28.413
If I was to guess, I'd say
the blackouts are stress-related.

105
00:08:28.914 --> 00:08:30.499
But he's 7 years old.

106
00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:33.251
What kind of stress
can a 7-year-old have?

107
00:08:33.418 --> 00:08:35.796
Plenty. Maybe he has
severe coping problems...

108
00:08:35.962 --> 00:08:37.464
...about not having a father.

109
00:08:38.256 --> 00:08:40.258
You said the last time
the blackouts occurred...

110
00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:42.135
...he was visiting his friend's dad.

111
00:08:44.012 --> 00:08:47.224
Well, he has been pushing me
to meet his father...

112
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:51.103
- ...and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.

113
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:53.438
We can arrange a controlled meeting.

114
00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:56.942
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security...

115
00:08:57.109 --> 00:08:59.027
...Evan comes in for a quick visit...

116
00:08:59.194 --> 00:09:00.612
...and with a little luck...

117
00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:03.782
...no more missing father complex.

118
00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:09.163
<i>April 15th.</i>

119
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.416
<i>Today I get to meet my father.</i>

120
00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:14.418
<i>His name is Jason and he's crazy.</i>

121
00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:16.712
<i>I hope he lets me call him Dad.</i>

122
00:09:19.674 --> 00:09:24.262
- You mean Dad lives here?
- Not in this wing, actually, no.

123
00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:26.055
Now, if your dad seems a little sleepy...

124
00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:29.350
- ...it's because of the medicine, okay?
- Okay.

125
00:09:32.353 --> 00:09:34.772
It'll just be a moment, okay?

126
00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:07.639
It's okay. I won't bite.

127
00:10:09.224 --> 00:10:10.851
You've seen pictures of me, right?

128
00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:14.771
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your smile...

129
00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:17.232
...and your hair...

130
00:10:17.524 --> 00:10:19.610
I love...

131
00:10:19.776 --> 00:10:21.862
- No!
- ...you!

132
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:25.324
Unh! He has to die! It's the only way!

133
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.868
- Jason, stop!
- Unh!

134
00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:30.120
No!

135
00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:34.292
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

136
00:10:34.584 --> 00:10:37.754
Yeah, man, he's hurt bad. Get a stretcher.

137
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.798
- Let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

138
00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:45.386
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life...

139
00:10:45.553 --> 00:10:49.098
...we commend to Almighty God,
our brother Jason.

140
00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:51.392
The Lord bless him and keep him...

141
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:54.187
...the Lord make his face
to shine upon him...

142
00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:56.147
...and be gracious unto him...

143
00:10:56.314 --> 00:11:00.068
...and give him peace. Amen.

144
00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:41.819
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.

145
00:11:41.986 --> 00:11:44.363
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here.
What's up already?

146
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.864
What are you looking for?

147
00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:49.743
Shut up, lard ass.
And you, hold your fucking horses.

148
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.745
You know, it's here somewhere.

149
00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:54.331
We should go soon.

150
00:11:54.873 --> 00:11:56.834
If Dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

151
00:11:57.376 --> 00:11:59.253
So let's go.

152
00:12:01.798 --> 00:12:04.259
I knew Dad had
a blockbuster down here!

153
00:12:04.426 --> 00:12:06.219
Let's blow the shit out of something.

154
00:12:16.396 --> 00:12:17.981
Here you go, buddy.

155
00:12:18.606 --> 00:12:19.649
What? No frigging way.

156
00:12:19.816 --> 00:12:22.652
- I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

157
00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:25.238
Any of us does it and you're gonna
puss out and narc for sure.

158
00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:28.325
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.

159
00:12:28.491 --> 00:12:30.785
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

160
00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:36.166
There you go.

161
00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:39.002
It should buy you two minutes at least.

162
00:12:39.169 --> 00:12:40.462
Gee, thanks, friend.

163
00:12:49.847 --> 00:12:53.726
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.

164
00:13:04.362 --> 00:13:07.740
- Thanks.
- You got balls, man.

165
00:13:07.907 --> 00:13:09.283
Shit took you long enough.

166
00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:39.272
What the hell? Come on!

167
00:13:39.439 --> 00:13:41.108
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up!

168
00:13:41.274 --> 00:13:43.318
Evan, get your ass back here
and help me get him up.

169
00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:45.237
What the hell happened?
Where are we?

170
00:13:45.445 --> 00:13:47.322
Oh, my God. What did we do?

171
00:13:47.489 --> 00:13:49.991
Evan, come on. Help me. Unh.

172
00:13:50.617 --> 00:13:51.952
Oh, my God, how could we?

173
00:13:52.119 --> 00:13:54.621
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?

174
00:13:54.913 --> 00:13:58.583
He's fine. He's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

175
00:13:59.042 --> 00:14:00.877
What's wrong? Why isn't he speaking?

176
00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:02.421
He's in shock, ma'am.

177
00:14:06.967 --> 00:14:08.969
What is it? What happened?

178
00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:11.097
We were just in the woods building a fort...

179
00:14:11.264 --> 00:14:13.474
...when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay...

180
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:15.726
...and then he just froze up. Right, guys?

181
00:14:15.935 --> 00:14:17.937
What happened, Evan? The truth.

182
00:14:18.104 --> 00:14:20.189
I don't know. I don't remember.

183
00:14:20.398 --> 00:14:22.734
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.

184
00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:25.778
I blacked it out.

185
00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:29.323
Don't try to use your blackouts
to get out of this one.

186
00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:36.622
You're not making it up?

187
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:46.674
<i>I don't know.</i>

188
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:49.802
<i>They're keeping him
overnight for observation.</i>

189
00:14:49.969 --> 00:14:54.390
<i>Uh-huh. I just don't know
what to do with him.</i>

190
00:14:58.812 --> 00:15:00.981
<i>The last thing
I remember before the blackout...</i>

191
00:15:01.148 --> 00:15:03.942
<i>...was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.</i>

192
00:15:04.109 --> 00:15:08.655
<i>I think I was more focused on her hands
on mine than the mailbox across the street.</i>

193
00:15:08.822 --> 00:15:12.659
<i>Mom thinks that hypnosis might be
a good way to remember.</i>

194
00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:28.842
Damn it.

195
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.590
My father was crazy too?

196
00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:32.408
<i>Breathe in and breathe out. And relax.</i>

197
00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:35.494
You are completely asleep.

198
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.621
Relaxed.

199
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:42.835
I want you to take me to the time
you were in the woods with Lenny.

200
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.254
Think of it like a movie.

201
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.173
You can pause, rewind...

202
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.052
...or slow down any details you wish.

203
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:54.555
Understand?

204
00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.765
Yes.

205
00:16:56.932 --> 00:16:59.101
Where are you now?

206
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:02.104
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.

207
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.732
<i>My hands are over her ears.</i>

208
00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:06.359
Are you hurting her?

209
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.696
No, I'm protecting her.

210
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.742
Okay. Now let's move forward in time.

211
00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.036
What do you see?

212
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.249
I see a car.

213
00:17:22.626 --> 00:17:25.837
Yes, Evan, tell me about the car.

214
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.757
Go on.

215
00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:31.301
Nothing can hurt you.

216
00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:37.015
Remember, it's only a movie.
You're completely safe.

217
00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:39.017
I can't-

218
00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.227
The car vanishes and all of a sudden...

219
00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.188
...I'm on the ground in the woods.

220
00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:44.648
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.

221
00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:47.776
The movie in your head
is broken, that's all.

222
00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.737
Now, tell me about the car.

223
00:17:49.904 --> 00:17:52.448
I can't! It's coming-

224
00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:56.285
Fight it, Evan, hurry.

225
00:17:56.452 --> 00:17:58.454
It's coming!

226
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:00.581
- Oh, my God!
- On the count of 10...

227
00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:03.542
- ...you'll wake up feeling refreshed...
- What are you doing?

228
00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:05.044
...and remembering everything.

229
00:18:05.211 --> 00:18:08.839
- What is happening? Make it stop!
- One, you're feeling awake.

230
00:18:09.006 --> 00:18:11.175
Two, your eyes are not feeling as heavy.

231
00:18:11.342 --> 00:18:12.426
- Five, six.
- Wake up!

232
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.596
- Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10.
- Wake him up!

233
00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:19.809
Oh, God.

234
00:18:22.812 --> 00:18:24.563
What happened?

235
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.691
Did it work?

236
00:18:33.532 --> 00:18:35.617
All right, thanks, Mom. See you later.

237
00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:47.921
Wipe that sad-ass look off your face
before you get us busted.

238
00:18:48.088 --> 00:18:50.298
Did you see the way
Evan's mom was looking at you?

239
00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:52.300
Sorry.

240
00:18:55.971 --> 00:19:00.517
All right, will someone tell me already
what the hell happened with the mailbox?

241
00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:04.646
Don't you ever
bring that shit up again.

242
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.023
Not ever!

243
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:14.197
Let's go.

244
00:19:17.577 --> 00:19:19.579
Are you okay?

245
00:19:33.342 --> 00:19:34.719
Holy shit!

246
00:19:34.886 --> 00:19:36.929
Look at that fat fuck!

247
00:19:37.096 --> 00:19:39.182
He's got bigger titties
than Lenny's mom.

248
00:19:39.348 --> 00:19:42.185
- Shh!
- Shut up, faggot.

249
00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:43.394
No one's talking to you.

250
00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:11.423
I'm sorry, Kayleigh, this was a bad idea.

251
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.843
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

252
00:20:15.844 --> 00:20:17.971
You're so lucky.

253
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.225
Look, everything's gonna be okay.
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.

254
00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:25.395
Sorry.

255
00:20:25.562 --> 00:20:28.190
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called Dad...

256
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:30.609
...and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.

257
00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:32.027
Your dad did that?

258
00:20:32.986 --> 00:20:36.115
- I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?

259
00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:40.452
What you deserve is a better father and brother.
All they do is make you feel like shit.

260
00:20:43.872 --> 00:20:46.000
You really have no clue
how beautiful you are, do you?

261
00:20:57.554 --> 00:20:59.389
What the fuck are you doing?!

262
00:20:59.556 --> 00:21:02.225
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?

263
00:21:02.392 --> 00:21:05.562
- Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.

264
00:21:05.728 --> 00:21:08.565
- He's a little punk.
- Why do you have to be such a dick?

265
00:21:08.731 --> 00:21:11.151
Who the fuck cares?

266
00:21:12.527 --> 00:21:15.947
- Ha, ha. Did you see how far he fell?
- I can't believe you just did that.

267
00:21:16.156 --> 00:21:18.741
- Look, it's just carpet.
- Ha-ha-ha.

268
00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:22.829
Stop it!

269
00:21:22.996 --> 00:21:24.247
Stop hitting him!

270
00:21:24.873 --> 00:21:27.417
What's wrong with you?!

271
00:21:29.169 --> 00:21:30.754
Somebody, please help us.

272
00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:33.674
All right, that's it, kid. You're out of here.

273
00:21:36.927 --> 00:21:39.471
Get him away!

274
00:21:39.638 --> 00:21:40.973
Get him away!

275
00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:44.435
<i>Now, in another story,
the peaceful town of Briarville...</i>

276
00:21:44.602 --> 00:21:48.772
<i>...was rocked this afternoon
in the wake of a horrible act of vandalism.</i>

277
00:21:48.939 --> 00:21:50.774
<i>While police officials in upstate New York...</i>

278
00:21:50.941 --> 00:21:54.320
<i>...believe this was a simple act
of criminal mischief gone awry...</i>

279
00:21:54.486 --> 00:21:57.615
<i>...the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.</i>

280
00:21:57.781 --> 00:22:01.076
<i>Now, this was the grisly aftermath
of a powerful explosion...</i>

281
00:22:01.243 --> 00:22:04.955
<i>...believed to have been caused
by an unknown quantity of dynamite.</i>

282
00:22:05.122 --> 00:22:09.877
<i>The police have no leads,
no suspects and no motive for the...</i>

283
00:22:26.811 --> 00:22:28.813
Good night.

284
00:22:38.281 --> 00:22:39.366
We're moving.

285
00:22:58.052 --> 00:23:00.262
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me.

286
00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:02.723
He knows I'm moving away, right?

287
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.934
He's been acting real strange lately.

288
00:23:05.101 --> 00:23:07.728
He won't even look me
in the eyes any more.

289
00:23:08.562 --> 00:23:09.730
Duck, here they come.

290
00:23:15.528 --> 00:23:18.364
Did your mom say if Lenny was okay?

291
00:23:20.324 --> 00:23:24.161
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

292
00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:49.104
Welcome home.

293
00:23:49.563 --> 00:23:51.773
I thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.

294
00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.986
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

295
00:24:06.038 --> 00:24:08.248
So, what'd you do in there?

296
00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:10.250
It was awful. You can't sleep...

297
00:24:10.417 --> 00:24:14.087
...because everybody's
screaming all night long.

298
00:24:14.254 --> 00:24:16.548
I never wanna go back.

299
00:24:16.715 --> 00:24:18.133
Do you see that?

300
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.886
Yeah, what's up with the smoke?

301
00:24:43.534 --> 00:24:47.080
Crockett!
What are you doing with my dog?!

302
00:24:52.335 --> 00:24:54.837
- Look what you made me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?!

303
00:25:09.686 --> 00:25:13.190
Kayleigh. Oh, God,
come on, please wake up.

304
00:25:13.357 --> 00:25:16.151
Wake up, please! Wake up!

305
00:25:16.318 --> 00:25:18.695
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

306
00:25:34.795 --> 00:25:36.964
How long was I out?

307
00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:41.176
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

308
00:25:45.764 --> 00:25:47.474
Oh, shit.

309
00:26:39.528 --> 00:26:41.739
I'm sorry.

310
00:27:09.683 --> 00:27:10.726
Aced it.

311
00:27:10.893 --> 00:27:13.354
And time. Put your pencils down...

312
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.359
...and place your blue books
on my desk before you leave.

313
00:27:17.526 --> 00:27:20.403
You too, Mr. Nelson.
We're all in the same time zone here.

314
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.781
- Fuck you.
- So how'd you do, Evan?

315
00:27:22.948 --> 00:27:26.409
I don't know. I might have got
some of the stories mixed up.

316
00:27:26.576 --> 00:27:29.287
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

317
00:27:31.498 --> 00:27:34.417
Typical psych major, a complete wise-ass.

318
00:27:34.584 --> 00:27:37.337
How's your project coming?
Are you still planning to change the way...

319
00:27:37.504 --> 00:27:40.549
...we humble scientists
view memory assimilation?

320
00:27:40.715 --> 00:27:42.842
Don't really have a choice.

321
00:28:00.068 --> 00:28:04.740
<i>I don't wanna hear one excuse
For what's been done to me</i>

322
00:28:05.992 --> 00:28:11.497
<i>You try to stand there and tell me I'm wrong</i>

323
00:28:11.664 --> 00:28:14.542
Oh, jeez, it smells like
patchouli and ass in here.

324
00:28:14.709 --> 00:28:18.004
Cricket, this is my
well-mannered roommate Evan.

325
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.799
Yeah. You're the one
that fucked up the bell curve...

326
00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:24.051
...on my anthropology final.

327
00:28:24.218 --> 00:28:25.928
- Later, Thumper.
- Bye.

328
00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:28.598
Fucking dick.

329
00:28:28.764 --> 00:28:31.142
- Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro.

330
00:28:32.435 --> 00:28:34.228
- Oh, you sick fuck.
- Ha-ha-ha.

331
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.358
All right, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

332
00:28:39.525 --> 00:28:41.944
Why, what'd you do,
ace another midterm?

333
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:43.863
No.

334
00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:48.702
Better than that.
Seven years, no blackouts.

335
00:28:49.369 --> 00:28:53.248
- Fuck, yeah, bro, let's do this! Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

336
00:28:53.415 --> 00:28:56.752
Come and get it. Aah, be gentle with me!
Be gentle! I'm postcoital.

337
00:28:56.918 --> 00:28:59.755
- I'm tender. There's chafing.
- Did she cradle the balls, work the shaft?

338
00:29:04.926 --> 00:29:05.969
Nice.

339
00:29:08.764 --> 00:29:10.265
This fucking guy.

340
00:29:11.808 --> 00:29:13.185
Get the fuck out of my bar.

341
00:29:13.352 --> 00:29:16.355
So, which one of you has the pet worm?

342
00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:18.649
Worms, plural!

343
00:29:18.815 --> 00:29:21.902
Ah. That's so gross.

344
00:29:22.069 --> 00:29:24.821
Talk to him about it. He's got the fetish.

345
00:29:25.322 --> 00:29:27.491
Watch it. It's a psych project actually.

346
00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:29.911
It's a study on memory loss.

347
00:29:30.078 --> 00:29:33.539
Better explain before all this
excitement gives me a heart attack.

348
00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:37.210
Ten bucks says he eats it off the floor.

349
00:29:38.169 --> 00:29:40.546
Well, if I can figure out...

350
00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:43.174
...how the memories
of a simple worm function...

351
00:29:43.341 --> 00:29:45.718
...it should help me to understand
the complexities...

352
00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.847
...of the human brain.

353
00:29:51.182 --> 00:29:53.309
Let me get this shot.

354
00:30:00.316 --> 00:30:01.901
- What the fuck, weirdo?!
- Fuck this!

355
00:30:09.951 --> 00:30:13.247
Well, I guess that's your game.

356
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:16.083
- Go, you go.
- Ha-ha-ha.

357
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.960
MAN 1 ;
What have you got there?

358
00:30:20.796 --> 00:30:23.757
No, no!

359
00:30:24.883 --> 00:30:26.718
It smells like sex in here.

360
00:30:26.885 --> 00:30:31.140
Yeah, ha, ha.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.

361
00:30:31.765 --> 00:30:34.184
You're kidding? He's so big.

362
00:30:35.644 --> 00:30:41.066
Yeah? Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

363
00:30:42.234 --> 00:30:44.862
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

364
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.284
You got any incense
or scented candles or something?

365
00:30:50.492 --> 00:30:52.161
Okay.

366
00:30:53.537 --> 00:30:56.124
Whoa, no.

367
00:30:56.958 --> 00:30:59.127
Let me put this away.

368
00:30:59.294 --> 00:31:01.504
Most guys usually tuck porn
under their bed.

369
00:31:01.671 --> 00:31:04.799
- All you've got are comp books?
- Yeah, they're my journals.

370
00:31:04.966 --> 00:31:07.635
I've been keeping them since I was 7.

371
00:31:07.802 --> 00:31:10.764
Wow. Hmm.

372
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:14.767
- Read me something.
- Uh...

373
00:31:14.934 --> 00:31:18.730
I ought to be getting something out of this.
That's all I gotta say.

374
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:23.151
Here we go. Ha, ha.

375
00:31:23.318 --> 00:31:27.405
"It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing."

376
00:31:30.116 --> 00:31:31.868
Uh...

377
00:31:32.035 --> 00:31:35.830
"Hearing Crockett
make those awful screams..."

378
00:31:41.212 --> 00:31:45.674
Uh... "Just writing about it
gives me the shivers."

379
00:31:47.134 --> 00:31:50.221
Come on. Go on.

380
00:31:53.682 --> 00:31:58.687
"It was like Tommy
was possessed or something.

381
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:02.024
There was a hate in his eyes that..."

382
00:32:08.405 --> 00:32:09.824
Are you okay?

383
00:32:16.997 --> 00:32:19.041
Where am I?

384
00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:22.127
What the hell's going on?

385
00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:34.766
I can't get it open!

386
00:32:34.933 --> 00:32:36.560
Drop it...

387
00:32:36.726 --> 00:32:39.521
...or I'll slit your mother's throat
in her sleep.

388
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:46.111
Unh! I got him, Lenny. Save Crockett!

389
00:32:54.286 --> 00:32:56.454
Listen to me, Evan,
and you listen to me good.

390
00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:58.540
There's a million
other sisters in the world...

391
00:32:58.707 --> 00:33:01.376
...so why'd you have to fuck with mine?

392
00:33:05.755 --> 00:33:08.509
It's okay. It was just a dream.

393
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.220
Uh-uh.

394
00:33:11.387 --> 00:33:15.433
- It didn't feel like a dream.
- Maybe because they never do.

395
00:33:16.517 --> 00:33:19.812
So, Don Juan, you pass out
on all your dates?

396
00:33:55.932 --> 00:33:58.644
Lenny? Hey, I've got a surprise for you.

397
00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.771
- You're never gonna guess who's here.
- Hey.

398
00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:04.441
It's me. Evan.

399
00:34:40.353 --> 00:34:43.231
What are you working on there?
A model?

400
00:34:46.234 --> 00:34:47.694
Look, uh...

401
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.487
...I can see that you're busy...

402
00:34:49.696 --> 00:34:51.864
...so I'll try to make this quick.

403
00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:54.450
Remember, uh...

404
00:34:54.617 --> 00:34:56.786
...that day at the junkyard...

405
00:34:56.995 --> 00:34:59.163
...when we were kids?

406
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.292
Well, I was just hoping
you could help me remember.

407
00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:09.757
Like, just any details about it or...

408
00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:13.803
I couldn't cut the rope.

409
00:35:14.971 --> 00:35:16.597
Yeah.

410
00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:19.977
That's good. Urn...

411
00:35:20.978 --> 00:35:22.021
Anything else?

412
00:35:26.483 --> 00:35:29.403
"Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep!"

413
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.700
Urn...

414
00:35:39.455 --> 00:35:41.415
Jesus Christ.

415
00:35:44.001 --> 00:35:46.670
It really happened.

416
00:35:46.837 --> 00:35:49.506
Wow, uh...

417
00:35:49.673 --> 00:35:51.383
Wow, Lenny, I-

418
00:35:54.178 --> 00:35:56.096
"Make one peep...

419
00:35:56.263 --> 00:36:00.727
...and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker."

420
00:36:34.636 --> 00:36:36.554
"The last thing I remember
before the blackout...

421
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:39.140
...was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

422
00:36:39.307 --> 00:36:43.103
I think I was more
focused on her hands on mine...

423
00:36:43.269 --> 00:36:45.940
...than on the mailbox...

424
00:36:46.315 --> 00:36:48.692
...across the street."

425
00:37:01.122 --> 00:37:03.165
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?

426
00:37:03.332 --> 00:37:04.834
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

427
00:37:14.552 --> 00:37:17.847
You make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

428
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.229
Unh! Fuck.

429
00:37:30.902 --> 00:37:34.447
What's this? Huh? What's this?

430
00:37:39.703 --> 00:37:42.664
How's my sweet girl?

431
00:37:42.831 --> 00:37:44.457
How's my sweet girl?

432
00:37:44.624 --> 00:37:47.169
You need a change, don't you, honey?

433
00:37:47.335 --> 00:37:48.962
You wanna open it?

434
00:37:49.129 --> 00:37:50.338
You wanna open it?

435
00:37:54.259 --> 00:37:57.345
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Holy shit! Run!

436
00:37:57.679 --> 00:38:00.056
Fuck, Lenny, come on!

437
00:38:00.223 --> 00:38:01.683
Lenny, come on!

438
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.102
Come on, Lenny, let's go!

439
00:38:11.401 --> 00:38:13.279
Come up here, bitch.

440
00:38:19.327 --> 00:38:23.664
Christ, man, fucking brutal.

441
00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:27.209
What the-?

442
00:38:30.338 --> 00:38:33.049
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, who is this?</i>

443
00:38:33.215 --> 00:38:36.385
Mrs. Kagan, um, it's Evan Treborn.

444
00:38:36.552 --> 00:38:39.305
<i>I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.</i>

445
00:38:39.472 --> 00:38:43.017
Yeah, I'm... Look, I'm really
sorry about that. It's-

446
00:38:43.184 --> 00:38:45.728
<i>It took me over an hour
to clean up the mess you made.</i>

447
00:38:45.895 --> 00:38:48.105
Can I just talk to Lenny?

448
00:38:48.272 --> 00:38:49.315
<i>Don't call here.</i>

449
00:38:57.783 --> 00:38:59.493
Mom.

450
00:39:00.994 --> 00:39:03.121
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you.

451
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.375
Hey, did, uh~? Did Da-

452
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:09.169
Did Jason get good grades?

453
00:39:09.336 --> 00:39:12.047
Please, he got straight A's
without ever touching a book.

454
00:39:12.214 --> 00:39:15.092
It was the one area
his memory never failed him.

455
00:39:15.258 --> 00:39:17.344
Did he ever say that he, like...

456
00:39:17.511 --> 00:39:20.722
...figured out a way to recall
his lost memories...

457
00:39:20.889 --> 00:39:24.685
...like, years after he blacked them out
in the first place?

458
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:27.980
- Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being...

459
00:39:28.146 --> 00:39:29.648
...you know, such a brain and all...

460
00:39:29.815 --> 00:39:34.111
...it's like, you would think that he would figure
out a way to remember stuff that he forgot.

461
00:39:35.195 --> 00:39:37.322
Well, when he was your age...

462
00:39:37.489 --> 00:39:39.534
...almost exactly your age,
come to think of it...

463
00:39:40.368 --> 00:39:43.454
...he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

464
00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:45.415
I couldn't tell if they were
real memories...

465
00:39:45.581 --> 00:39:47.625
...or just his imagination.

466
00:39:47.792 --> 00:39:53.047
Then, just before it got so bad he, uh...

467
00:39:53.464 --> 00:39:55.633
...had to be institutionalized...

468
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.553
...he said he could...

469
00:39:59.887 --> 00:40:01.723
What?

470
00:40:01.889 --> 00:40:03.683
What?

471
00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:08.813
- What could he do?
- Forget it.

472
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.525
It's nothing. He was far too sick by then.

473
00:40:17.697 --> 00:40:20.992
Come on, Mom,
what'd he say that he could do?

474
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.872
What do you say, as a goof?

475
00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:26.373
No, Mom, come on.

476
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.376
"Come on" yourself. It'll be fun.

477
00:40:30.085 --> 00:40:32.254
All right, it's your dime.

478
00:40:42.556 --> 00:40:43.766
Give me your hand, young man.

479
00:40:43.932 --> 00:40:46.352
- This is supposed to be your trick.
- Uh-uh.

480
00:40:48.896 --> 00:40:50.230
No!

481
00:40:54.068 --> 00:40:56.195
Have you ever had
your palm read before?

482
00:40:56.695 --> 00:41:00.157
No, this is the first time,
so be gentle, please.

483
00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:01.366
- What?
- Ha-ha-ha.

484
00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.410
You have no lifeline.

485
00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.748
You don't belong here.

486
00:41:08.458 --> 00:41:11.795
For an extra 5 bucks
she'll spit in your face, Mom.

487
00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:13.880
No, really, what's his future?

488
00:41:14.255 --> 00:41:15.715
He has no soul.

489
00:41:18.218 --> 00:41:19.719
You were never meant to be.

490
00:41:25.016 --> 00:41:26.935
Psychic, huh?

491
00:41:27.102 --> 00:41:29.896
This won't come as much
of a shock to you.

492
00:41:39.447 --> 00:41:42.367
- Thank you.
- No problem.

493
00:41:48.832 --> 00:41:50.126
When'd you start smoking again?

494
00:41:50.292 --> 00:41:52.336
Lay off, Evan.

495
00:41:55.464 --> 00:41:57.341
Hey.

496
00:41:57.758 --> 00:41:59.468
What-?

497
00:42:00.553 --> 00:42:04.640
You're not gonna let that old hag
ruin the rest of our time together?

498
00:42:04.807 --> 00:42:06.517
She's nuts, she's a lunatic.

499
00:42:06.684 --> 00:42:08.310
They-That's like an act.

500
00:42:08.477 --> 00:42:10.688
- They just do that-
- I know.

501
00:42:10.855 --> 00:42:13.858
I'm sorry, she just hit a nerve.

502
00:42:16.902 --> 00:42:20.573
Well, why?

503
00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:23.075
I don't get it.

504
00:42:23.576 --> 00:42:25.661
Before you were born,
I was pregnant twice...

505
00:42:25.828 --> 00:42:28.038
...and they were both stillbirths.

506
00:42:35.422 --> 00:42:37.883
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

507
00:42:41.052 --> 00:42:44.347
It's not something I like to remember.

508
00:42:44.806 --> 00:42:47.851
And then when I was
pregnant with you...

509
00:42:48.393 --> 00:42:49.728
...I was terrified.

510
00:42:49.895 --> 00:42:52.564
I had to expect the worst.

511
00:42:55.817 --> 00:42:57.194
And?

512
00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.905
And you came out fine.

513
00:43:00.947 --> 00:43:05.327
And ever since then, I've considered you
my little miracle baby.

514
00:43:13.502 --> 00:43:15.128
Don't cry.

515
00:43:15.295 --> 00:43:17.965
Come on, let's go. It's late.

516
00:43:28.726 --> 00:43:31.729
"I never wanted
to be in the movie, anyway.

517
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.775
I was cold, so I wanted to wear my clothes.

518
00:43:36.108 --> 00:43:37.568
Mr. Miller took my shirt off."

519
00:43:37.735 --> 00:43:42.490
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Shh, I need quiet for this.

520
00:43:42.657 --> 00:43:44.659
Are you stupid or what, man?

521
00:43:45.368 --> 00:43:47.245
Maybe there's a reason
you repressed the day...

522
00:43:47.411 --> 00:43:50.581
...some pervert had you
in your tighty-whities.

523
00:43:53.125 --> 00:43:55.086
Hey, man, I'd think twice
about what you're doing.

524
00:43:55.253 --> 00:43:57.630
You could wake up a lot more
fucked-up than you are now.

525
00:43:57.797 --> 00:43:59.924
- More fucked-up than I already am?
- No, I'm-

526
00:44:00.091 --> 00:44:02.386
You think you know me? I don't know me.

527
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.676
Whoa!

528
00:44:43.135 --> 00:44:44.554
Oh, shit. Sorry.

529
00:44:45.179 --> 00:44:47.181
No, it's my fault.

530
00:44:47.348 --> 00:44:49.017
Can we get through one damn day...

531
00:44:49.183 --> 00:44:50.810
...without you breaking something?

532
00:45:18.338 --> 00:45:20.048
Hey.

533
00:45:23.885 --> 00:45:24.927
Evan.

534
00:45:26.638 --> 00:45:30.726
Oh, my God. It's been a long time.

535
00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:36.023
- How you been?
- Same old, same old, you know?

536
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.693
No, I don't know. Fill me in.

537
00:45:40.027 --> 00:45:44.073
Uh, well, I'm going to State now.

538
00:45:44.239 --> 00:45:47.117
It's going good. My mom's good.

539
00:45:48.452 --> 00:45:50.204
You want a smoke?

540
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:52.623
- No, not since we were kids.
- Yeah?

541
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:56.335
- I've quit, like, 100 times.
- Ha-ha-ha.

542
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:01.799
- Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.

543
00:46:01.965 --> 00:46:05.469
- Can I walk you?
- Sure. Heh.

544
00:46:07.221 --> 00:46:10.182
- Oh, my God.
- So...

545
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:14.854
...how's Tommy?

546
00:46:16.898 --> 00:46:20.402
Well, they kept him
in juvie for a few years...

547
00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:22.779
...but now he's working
over at Dale's Auto Body.

548
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.698
That's good.

549
00:46:27.575 --> 00:46:29.119
Still living with your dad?

550
00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.246
No.

551
00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:34.249
I emancipated myself at 15.

552
00:46:36.209 --> 00:46:38.545
Must've taken a lot of courage.

553
00:46:38.711 --> 00:46:41.172
Not if you remember my dad.

554
00:46:44.467 --> 00:46:47.053
Well, couldn't you have just
moved in with your mom?

555
00:46:48.179 --> 00:46:49.681
No, she had a new family.

556
00:46:49.848 --> 00:46:53.643
Wasn't enough room. Whatever.

557
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.107
Well, look, the reason I came back
to town was to talk to you.

558
00:46:58.274 --> 00:47:01.193
To me? Why?

559
00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:05.197
Ahem. Well... Heh. Heh.

560
00:47:05.364 --> 00:47:09.660
Remember when we were kids
and I used to have those blackouts?

561
00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:12.079
Yeah, of course.

562
00:47:12.288 --> 00:47:15.374
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

563
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:18.794
And I just-I wanted to talk to you...

564
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:20.588
...about one of them in particular.

565
00:47:20.796 --> 00:47:23.132
Well, I'll try to remember.

566
00:47:27.303 --> 00:47:29.305
When we were kids, uh...

567
00:47:29.472 --> 00:47:31.724
...your dad was making a movie...

568
00:47:31.891 --> 00:47:35.269
...about Robin Hood, something.

569
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:37.188
What do you wanna know, Evan?

570
00:47:41.193 --> 00:47:42.861
Is-? Did he-?

571
00:47:44.654 --> 00:47:47.574
What happened in the basement?

572
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:49.659
Look, it was a long time ago.

573
00:47:51.787 --> 00:47:53.371
I know.

574
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.249
Is that why you came
all the way back here?

575
00:47:56.416 --> 00:47:58.835
To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?

576
00:47:59.002 --> 00:48:01.379
No, I-

577
00:48:02.047 --> 00:48:05.217
I just think that something really bad
might have happened.

578
00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:07.511
Is there a point to any of this?

579
00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:11.598
Look, whatever happened,
it wasn't our fault.

580
00:48:12.224 --> 00:48:15.227
We were kids. I mean, there was
nothing that we could do to deserve-

581
00:48:15.477 --> 00:48:17.562
Just shut up, Evan!

582
00:48:17.729 --> 00:48:19.648
You're wasting your breath.

583
00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:22.568
You can't hate yourself
because your dad's a twisted freak.

584
00:48:23.236 --> 00:48:26.322
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?

585
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:28.574
You come all the way
back here to stir up my shit...

586
00:48:28.741 --> 00:48:31.369
...just because you have
a bad memory?

587
00:48:31.536 --> 00:48:33.579
What, do you want me
to just cry on your shoulder...

588
00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:35.998
...and tell you everything's
all better now?

589
00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:38.209
Well, fuck you, Evan!

590
00:48:38.626 --> 00:48:40.336
Nothing's all better, okay?

591
00:48:40.503 --> 00:48:43.422
Nothing ever gets better!

592
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.886
You know, if I was so wonderful, Evan...

593
00:48:49.053 --> 00:48:50.763
...why didn't you call me?

594
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.808
Why did you just leave me here to rot?

595
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.296
Some dude left a message for you.

596
00:49:22.462 --> 00:49:25.215
You can smell that
all the way in the bathroom.

597
00:49:28.093 --> 00:49:29.803
<i>Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.</i>

598
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.055
<i>I just wondered why you didn't
hand in your essay.</i>

599
00:49:32.222 --> 00:49:36.351
<i>I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.</i>

600
00:49:39.605 --> 00:49:42.065
<i>What'd you say to my sister, motherfucker?</i>

601
00:49:42.232 --> 00:49:45.444
<i>Last night she cried on the phone
for over an hour to me.</i>

602
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:48.280
<i>She said you came
and saw her last night.</i>

603
00:49:48.447 --> 00:49:50.199
<i>She-</i>

604
00:49:50.366 --> 00:49:53.328
<i>She fucking killed herself tonight.</i>

605
00:49:53.494 --> 00:49:55.538
<i>She's dead.</i>

606
00:49:55.705 --> 00:49:57.040
<i>And so are you.</i>

607
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:20.125
<i>If the scar on my stomach
didn't just come out of nowhere...</i>

608
00:51:20.291 --> 00:51:23.962
<i>...maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as everyone thought.</i>

609
00:51:25.046 --> 00:51:29.342
<i>If I can make scars,
do I have the power to heal them?</i>

610
00:51:30.927 --> 00:51:33.638
<i>What about Kayleigh's scars?</i>

611
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.688
"I never wanted to be in the movie, anyway.

612
00:51:42.063 --> 00:51:46.776
It was cold,
so I wanted to wear my clothes.

613
00:51:48.528 --> 00:51:53.116
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off."

614
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.006
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.

615
00:52:07.173 --> 00:52:09.175
It'll look more like a dungeon down there.

616
00:52:11.719 --> 00:52:15.556
A little light here. Huh?

617
00:52:17.933 --> 00:52:21.061
Hey, now, what did I tell you
about keeping that door shut?

618
00:52:21.228 --> 00:52:22.354
But I wanna see.

619
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:26.734
You'll see the back of my fist in about
two seconds if you don't do what I tell you.

620
00:52:29.236 --> 00:52:31.822
Now, in this part of the story...

621
00:52:31.989 --> 00:52:35.618
...Robin Hood has just married
Maid Marian...

622
00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:40.539
...and they have to kiss and stuff,
like the grown-ups do.

623
00:52:41.207 --> 00:52:43.167
So take off your clothes, Kayleigh.

624
00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:49.174
Come on, just like when we take a bath.

625
00:52:49.341 --> 00:52:51.676
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.

626
00:52:53.553 --> 00:52:57.349
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.

627
00:52:57.516 --> 00:52:59.976
Put your hands on your ears.

628
00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:04.523
What time is it?

629
00:53:04.689 --> 00:53:08.902
It's time for you to do what I tell you to do.

630
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:11.029
Wrong answer, fuckbag!

631
00:53:11.446 --> 00:53:13.865
This is the very moment
of your reckoning.

632
00:53:14.032 --> 00:53:17.744
In the next 30 seconds, you're gonna
open up one of two doors.

633
00:53:17.953 --> 00:53:20.872
The first door will forever traumatize
your own flesh and blood.

634
00:53:21.039 --> 00:53:24.501
What-? What-? What's happening?

635
00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:25.919
How are you doing this?

636
00:53:26.127 --> 00:53:30.091
It'll change your daughter
from a beautiful child...

637
00:53:30.258 --> 00:53:34.137
...into an empty shell
whose only concept of trust...

638
00:53:34.303 --> 00:53:37.974
...was betrayed by her own
sick pedophile father!

639
00:53:38.141 --> 00:53:41.269
Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide.

640
00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:44.438
- Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?

641
00:53:44.605 --> 00:53:47.942
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George.

642
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:51.445
Your other option is to treat Kayleigh like-

643
00:53:51.612 --> 00:53:53.698
Say like a loving father treats his daughter.

644
00:53:55.032 --> 00:53:57.118
Sound okay to you, Papa?

645
00:53:58.369 --> 00:54:01.122
- Yes.
- Listen close then, fuckbag.

646
00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:04.041
You screw this up again...

647
00:54:04.709 --> 00:54:07.378
...I'll flat-out castrate you.

648
00:54:08.421 --> 00:54:11.465
What you need to do
is discipline your son Tommy...

649
00:54:11.633 --> 00:54:14.553
...because the kid is one sadistic pup.

650
00:54:15.971 --> 00:54:17.139
One last thing.

651
00:54:24.438 --> 00:54:26.315
Don't ever touch me again!

652
00:54:28.275 --> 00:54:29.776
I- I won't.

653
00:54:56.095 --> 00:54:58.139
Crockett!

654
00:54:59.307 --> 00:55:01.601
Kayleigh, I can't believe you came.

655
00:55:02.393 --> 00:55:04.312
Hey, you got one.

656
00:55:04.479 --> 00:55:06.314
Check out our new house.

657
00:55:07.774 --> 00:55:08.900
Hell or high water.

658
00:55:14.656 --> 00:55:16.115
Honey, are you all right?

659
00:55:19.285 --> 00:55:21.496
Oh, my God, Evan, you're bleeding.

660
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:24.165
Kayleigh, you're st~ You.

661
00:55:24.582 --> 00:55:25.792
The-

662
00:55:27.919 --> 00:55:29.254
Incredible.

663
00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.424
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up
and come back to bed.

664
00:55:34.592 --> 00:55:37.971
Unh. Where are my clothes?

665
00:55:38.137 --> 00:55:39.682
Those are your clothes, silly.

666
00:55:48.274 --> 00:55:50.317
The bathroom's-

667
00:55:54.113 --> 00:55:57.491
Hurry up.
I want a quickie before school.

668
00:55:57.658 --> 00:56:00.619
<i>C-H-I-P-H-I-B-E-T-A</i>

669
00:56:00.786 --> 00:56:02.663
<i>We're the Chi Phi Beta bitches</i>

670
00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:04.540
<i>We've come to play, meow</i>

671
00:56:04.707 --> 00:56:07.710
<i>We'll astound you with our beauty
Leave you nothing to say</i>

672
00:56:07.876 --> 00:56:12.131
<i>C-H-I-P-H-I-B-E-T-A, meow</i>

673
00:56:12.297 --> 00:56:15.092
<i>- C-H-I-P-H-I-B-E-T-A</i>
- Call me back in 45 minutes.

674
00:56:15.259 --> 00:56:19.513
<i>We're the Chi Phi Beta bitches
We've come to play, meow</i>

675
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.324
What?

676
00:56:39.117 --> 00:56:42.871
Un-fucking-believable. All right.

677
00:56:43.038 --> 00:56:46.249
I wish I could get
as excited over a nosebleed.

678
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:50.962
Sorry, uh, I didn't see you.

679
00:56:53.256 --> 00:56:54.466
What?

680
00:56:54.632 --> 00:56:57.719
You're the girl
that was with those assholes...

681
00:56:57.886 --> 00:57:00.430
...throwing the popcorn at Thumper.

682
00:57:00.597 --> 00:57:02.057
What?

683
00:57:02.223 --> 00:57:06.729
And your name is Gwen. I know you.

684
00:57:08.439 --> 00:57:11.442
Seriously, Evan, lay off the blow.

685
00:57:15.488 --> 00:57:17.573
- Hi.
- Hi.

686
00:57:22.953 --> 00:57:25.373
Hey, um, ahem...

687
00:57:25.539 --> 00:57:28.292
...don't freak out
when I ask you this...

688
00:57:29.001 --> 00:57:32.213
...but do you remember when
your dad got that video camera?

689
00:57:32.379 --> 00:57:34.507
What's up, man?

690
00:57:34.673 --> 00:57:36.592
Yeah, um...

691
00:57:36.759 --> 00:57:38.803
...I think he had it like the first day...

692
00:57:38.969 --> 00:57:41.180
...and then he gave it away or something.

693
00:57:41.347 --> 00:57:43.557
Why would that freak me out?

694
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:46.852
I don't know.

695
00:57:47.019 --> 00:57:51.650
- Just being weird. Heh.
- You are such a goofus.

696
00:57:53.777 --> 00:57:57.406
- So I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

697
00:58:00.659 --> 00:58:03.620
- Hey, guys. Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey.

698
00:58:18.385 --> 00:58:19.469
Come on, Mom.

699
00:58:19.636 --> 00:58:20.637
<i>- Andrea.
- Evan.</i>

700
00:58:20.804 --> 00:58:22.472
<i>- And Chuck.
- Aren't home right now.</i>

701
00:58:22.639 --> 00:58:24.015
<i>You know what to do.</i>

702
00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:27.185
Uh, hey, Mom.

703
00:58:27.352 --> 00:58:30.230
It's me. And hey, Chuck.

704
00:58:30.397 --> 00:58:33.400
Uh, I'm just calling to say hi, I guess.

705
00:58:33.568 --> 00:58:35.444
Give me a call back.

706
00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:42.243
Hey, Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

707
00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:45.246
What's the matter, you lost your Rolex?

708
00:58:45.413 --> 00:58:47.832
Fuck you, frat boy!

709
00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:53.087
Remember, everyone,
there's only two more weeks...

710
00:58:53.254 --> 00:58:55.756
...until your psych projects are due.

711
00:58:55.923 --> 00:58:58.718
Uh, about that essay I missed last week...

712
00:58:58.885 --> 00:59:01.387
...we're still okay with the extension, right?

713
00:59:01.554 --> 00:59:03.139
And you are?

714
00:59:03.306 --> 00:59:06.017
Evan Treborn.

715
00:59:06.184 --> 00:59:07.643
Well, the answer's no, Mr. Treborn.

716
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:11.147
Now, please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.

717
00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.613
All right, settle down, everyone.

718
00:59:17.779 --> 00:59:21.325
The exam will begin in one minute.

719
00:59:25.787 --> 00:59:26.914
Get off me, asshole.

720
00:59:27.414 --> 00:59:29.750
You guys started that shit.

721
00:59:29.917 --> 00:59:32.169
Evan, you're hysterical.

722
00:59:34.296 --> 00:59:36.298
Did you study for this?

723
00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:39.843
Oh, uh...

724
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:41.637
...we'll find out, huh?

725
00:59:41.803 --> 00:59:44.181
Ha-ha-ha. Me neither.

726
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:58.904
- Holy shit. Are these the answers?
- Damn, Evan, keep it on the DL.

727
01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:07.622
Hey, uh...

728
01:00:08.414 --> 01:00:11.042
...I wanna do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night.

729
01:00:11.209 --> 01:00:14.796
Uh, so if I said that I needed...

730
01:00:14.963 --> 01:00:17.298
...some help from you and the brothers...

731
01:00:18.216 --> 01:00:19.884
I'd say "Blow me."

732
01:00:21.636 --> 01:00:22.804
Get the pledges to do it.

733
01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:26.766
- Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.

734
01:00:26.933 --> 01:00:29.936
You may begin now.

735
01:00:46.578 --> 01:00:49.873
Oh, that was so good.

736
01:00:50.207 --> 01:00:52.626
Oh, my God.

737
01:00:53.335 --> 01:00:56.213
Where'd you learn those new tricks?

738
01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:59.508
Why?

739
01:00:59.675 --> 01:01:02.386
It wasn't weird, was it?

740
01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:06.807
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.

741
01:01:16.108 --> 01:01:17.693
Hello?

742
01:01:19.778 --> 01:01:21.822
- Fuck them.
- Hello?

743
01:01:27.536 --> 01:01:29.873
Oh.

744
01:01:33.168 --> 01:01:35.795
What do you think it is about us...

745
01:01:35.962 --> 01:01:40.342
...that makes us so perfect?

746
01:01:42.052 --> 01:01:43.970
I mean...

747
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.599
...why did you sneak out...

748
01:01:47.766 --> 01:01:50.560
...to visit me after I moved away?

749
01:01:50.852 --> 01:01:52.729
Because I missed you.

750
01:01:55.357 --> 01:01:58.693
What, do you think my dad could have
stopped me from seeing you?

751
01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.821
What's he gonna do? Ha-ha-ha.

752
01:02:03.281 --> 01:02:05.450
Oh, my gosh. My toes are numb.

753
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:09.496
Do you think that we'll be together forever?

754
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.921
That is the plan, isn't it?

755
01:02:18.464 --> 01:02:21.342
- "Hell or high water"?
- Yeah.

756
01:02:22.551 --> 01:02:23.969
Yeah, that's-

757
01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:27.723
I was just making sure. Yup.

758
01:02:28.974 --> 01:02:32.603
Yeah, that's the plan! Heh.

759
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:44.740
All right, uh...

760
01:02:45.199 --> 01:02:48.828
...all you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

761
01:02:48.994 --> 01:02:50.746
Pledges. Uh...

762
01:02:50.913 --> 01:02:52.748
We're-We're pledges, sir.

763
01:02:53.165 --> 01:02:55.710
Uh, brother Evan, sir.

764
01:02:55.877 --> 01:02:59.256
Ha-ha-ha. Are you kidding me?

765
01:03:03.176 --> 01:03:05.262
What? What'd you say to me?

766
01:03:05.429 --> 01:03:07.806
You know what, give me
the Greek alphabet. Give it to me!

767
01:03:07.973 --> 01:03:09.266
- Uh, uh~
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

768
01:03:09.433 --> 01:03:11.143
- Alpha, beta-
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta...

769
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:15.522
...zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu,
xi, sigma, tau, upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, sir!

770
01:03:15.689 --> 01:03:19.443
Maybe that's what it is!
Don't fucking look at me, look down.

771
01:03:24.406 --> 01:03:25.907
Uh...

772
01:03:27.409 --> 01:03:29.619
All right, um...

773
01:03:31.455 --> 01:03:33.957
So you pledges...

774
01:03:34.124 --> 01:03:36.168
...you guys know
what you need to do for me.

775
01:03:36.334 --> 01:03:39.964
And, um, you guys take a shower.
And if anyone gives you any trouble...

776
01:03:40.131 --> 01:03:42.800
...you tell them I said it was okay.

777
01:03:46.596 --> 01:03:49.140
- What?
- Yo, what's up?

778
01:03:52.101 --> 01:03:54.103
- Shower that, bitch.
- Ha-ha-ha.

779
01:03:58.608 --> 01:04:00.985
I don't understand. Where are you taking me?

780
01:04:01.569 --> 01:04:03.404
I'm not telling.

781
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:14.916
Oh, my God!

782
01:04:21.005 --> 01:04:24.551
Wow, it's beautiful.

783
01:04:25.177 --> 01:04:26.887
Go on, sit down.

784
01:04:27.596 --> 01:04:29.515
Thank you.

785
01:04:30.015 --> 01:04:33.685
<i>You gave us some place to go</i>

786
01:04:35.145 --> 01:04:39.066
<i>I never said thank you for that</i>

787
01:04:40.025 --> 01:04:41.568
Why are you doing this for me?

788
01:04:43.237 --> 01:04:45.697
When I woke up this morning...

789
01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:49.535
...I saw your smile.

790
01:04:49.826 --> 01:04:54.289
That smile. And I knew...

791
01:04:54.748 --> 01:04:59.378
...that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you.

792
01:05:01.713 --> 01:05:03.799
<i>Now I'll never have a chance</i>

793
01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:08.429
<i>May angels lead you in</i>

794
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.894
I've been looking all over for you, man.

795
01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:16.354
Someone trashed your car.

796
01:05:24.028 --> 01:05:25.947
What the-?

797
01:05:27.031 --> 01:05:29.158
Who did this?

798
01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.702
Who did it?

799
01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:33.329
It was probably those Beta fuckers.

800
01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:36.332
No, no, no.

801
01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:40.044
How did somebody get away with this
right in front of the frat house?

802
01:05:42.463 --> 01:05:45.466
- MAN 1; Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

803
01:05:45.633 --> 01:05:47.886
Someone's gonna get their ass kicked.

804
01:05:48.094 --> 01:05:50.139
Don't.

805
01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.017
He might be watching.

806
01:05:54.018 --> 01:05:55.519
It's my fault.

807
01:05:55.686 --> 01:05:57.896
I should have told you
he was released a few weeks ago.

808
01:05:58.063 --> 01:06:00.566
Yeah, it might have been nice.

809
01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.946
God.

810
01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:13.746
Like this is gonna do any good.

811
01:06:13.912 --> 01:06:15.831
Maybe one of the frat guys
has got a gun.

812
01:06:15.998 --> 01:06:18.208
Evan, don't even joke!

813
01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:19.668
He's not gonna hurt you, okay?

814
01:06:19.835 --> 01:06:21.837
He's just trying
to scare you away from me.

815
01:06:22.463 --> 01:06:24.298
He killed my dog.

816
01:06:24.465 --> 01:06:27.384
- You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

817
01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.970
You know how bad he had it
when we were kids.

818
01:06:30.137 --> 01:06:33.892
Oh, no, don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

819
01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:35.477
You turned out just fine.

820
01:06:35.644 --> 01:06:37.812
My father never laid a hand on me.

821
01:06:38.521 --> 01:06:41.691
It's like that prick saved it all up
for Tommy.

822
01:06:46.237 --> 01:06:51.076
Okay. All right. Uh...

823
01:06:52.619 --> 01:06:56.122
We'll let campus security deal with it. Okay?

824
01:06:57.624 --> 01:07:00.335
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.

825
01:07:02.045 --> 01:07:04.839
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

826
01:07:05.006 --> 01:07:08.551
Evan, I just-I don't want Tommy
to see us together right now.

827
01:07:08.927 --> 01:07:11.972
No, I lost you once
and I'm not losing you again.

828
01:07:12.138 --> 01:07:13.640
What do you mean,
you lost me once?

829
01:07:13.807 --> 01:07:17.143
Evan, you never lost me.
What are you talking about?

830
01:07:17.311 --> 01:07:20.356
God, you've been acting so weird lately.

831
01:07:20.898 --> 01:07:24.485
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.

832
01:07:24.652 --> 01:07:26.237
I know that, but...

833
01:07:26.404 --> 01:07:29.532
...your accent's changed.
You don't even walk the same.

834
01:07:29.699 --> 01:07:31.200
What, I walk differently?

835
01:07:31.367 --> 01:07:32.868
I mean, that dinner tonight...

836
01:07:33.035 --> 01:07:34.995
...it was so beautiful. It was gorgeous.

837
01:07:35.162 --> 01:07:37.415
But it just wasn't you.

838
01:07:37.915 --> 01:07:41.002
I can't do something nice for you?
I mean, it's...

839
01:07:41.335 --> 01:07:44.505
Wait. Isn't that your jacket?

840
01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:57.268
Tommy!

841
01:07:58.561 --> 01:08:00.479
You stay away from us, you sick fuck.

842
01:08:00.855 --> 01:08:03.066
Oh, get this "us" shit.

843
01:08:03.233 --> 01:08:05.777
Like I'd ever lay a hand on my own sister.

844
01:08:05.944 --> 01:08:07.904
You're doing real nice for yourself, Evan.

845
01:08:08.071 --> 01:08:10.198
You've got a nice life...

846
01:08:10.699 --> 01:08:11.908
...you got nice friends...

847
01:08:12.075 --> 01:08:14.536
...not to mention you're fucking my sister.

848
01:08:14.703 --> 01:08:16.913
Not a bad piece of ass, if I say so myself.

849
01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.916
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.

850
01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:22.085
All right, what are you doing, man?
What the fuck?

851
01:08:22.252 --> 01:08:25.088
Oh, it's not good enough that
the whole fucking world loves you?

852
01:08:25.255 --> 01:08:28.884
But you gotta take the only thing on this
earth that doesn't think that I'm a piece of shit?

853
01:08:29.051 --> 01:08:30.135
Tommy, you know I love you.

854
01:08:30.302 --> 01:08:33.013
All right, look, no one thinks
that you're a piece of shit, Tom.

855
01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.349
Oh, yeah, what was it you said?
I think I believe it was, uh, "sick fuck"!

856
01:08:36.516 --> 01:08:39.019
- Don't! Tommy! Aah! Stop!
- Aah! Aah!

857
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:42.022
Oh, God! Oh, God! Stop!

858
01:08:42.606 --> 01:08:44.274
- Aah!
- Stop!

859
01:08:45.276 --> 01:08:48.529
Stop! Oh my God!

860
01:08:48.946 --> 01:08:50.114
Tommy. Unh.

861
01:08:51.073 --> 01:08:54.744
- Stop! Oh my God! Oh!
- Unh!

862
01:08:57.455 --> 01:09:00.625
No, Evan! Stop!

863
01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:04.962
- Stop it! You're gonna kill him!
- He's a fucking maniac!

864
01:09:06.297 --> 01:09:08.424
Don't do this, I'm begging you!

865
01:09:08.591 --> 01:09:09.842
You ruined Lenny's life!

866
01:09:11.761 --> 01:09:13.095
You killed Crockett!

867
01:09:13.262 --> 01:09:15.056
You killed that woman and her baby!

868
01:09:16.432 --> 01:09:18.768
Now you're trying to kill me.

869
01:09:18.935 --> 01:09:21.771
Just trying to fucking kill me!

870
01:09:30.614 --> 01:09:34.034
What did you do? What did you do?

871
01:09:34.201 --> 01:09:36.036
Oh, my God!

872
01:09:36.328 --> 01:09:39.331
Oh, my God! What did you do?

873
01:09:39.498 --> 01:09:42.334
- Oh, my God!
- Drop the bat! Come on!

874
01:10:13.366 --> 01:10:14.742
You right there, faggot!

875
01:10:42.854 --> 01:10:45.064
First time?

876
01:10:45.398 --> 01:10:47.025
Yeah.

877
01:10:48.318 --> 01:10:50.528
You'd better not bitch up, man.

878
01:10:50.695 --> 01:10:53.740
You'll wind up someone's luggage that way.

879
01:10:58.871 --> 01:11:00.497
Can you protect me?

880
01:11:01.749 --> 01:11:05.753
Jesus himself couldn't make me
stand up against the Brotherhood.

881
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.641
Look, man...

882
01:11:19.433 --> 01:11:21.226
...when they come...

883
01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:25.481
...you go some place else
in your head, man.

884
01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:27.858
Be somewhere else.

885
01:11:45.085 --> 01:11:47.254
Back your ass up.

886
01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.381
Move away.

887
01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:01.059
Yo, give me that.

888
01:12:02.394 --> 01:12:04.604
- My shit.
- Yeah, yeah.

889
01:12:05.397 --> 01:12:07.399
What's up?

890
01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:20.787
I spoke to your lawyer.

891
01:12:20.954 --> 01:12:25.001
And, uh, he says he's sure
he can get you off on self-defense.

892
01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:27.211
So if you're just patient...

893
01:12:27.378 --> 01:12:29.171
Mom...

894
01:12:30.298 --> 01:12:34.468
- ...how long am I gonna be in here?
- I don't know.

895
01:12:34.635 --> 01:12:37.304
These things take time.

896
01:12:37.888 --> 01:12:39.056
What about the journals?

897
01:12:39.223 --> 01:12:41.308
Did you bring me the ones
I asked you to bring?

898
01:12:41.475 --> 01:12:44.395
Yeah, I found these two.

899
01:12:44.603 --> 01:12:47.231
The others are still in storage.

900
01:12:47.398 --> 01:12:50.568
Mom! I-

901
01:12:54.739 --> 01:12:57.783
I need them all, all of them.

902
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:59.910
And I'm gonna get them to you...

903
01:13:00.077 --> 01:13:04.081
...but right now, you need to concentrate
on the case.

904
01:13:05.666 --> 01:13:07.169
Uh-

905
01:13:07.711 --> 01:13:09.087
Please.

906
01:13:11.506 --> 01:13:13.675
All right.

907
01:13:13.842 --> 01:13:15.677
You're right.

908
01:13:19.556 --> 01:13:22.059
What about Kayleigh?

909
01:13:22.225 --> 01:13:23.352
Is she all right?

910
01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.776
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

911
01:13:34.112 --> 01:13:35.197
Time's up.

912
01:13:35.364 --> 01:13:37.240
I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo.

913
01:13:37.407 --> 01:13:39.284
Promise me you'll hang on.

914
01:13:54.592 --> 01:13:57.303
Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.

915
01:14:06.187 --> 01:14:07.480
They're mine.

916
01:14:21.619 --> 01:14:22.995
Come on!

917
01:14:25.832 --> 01:14:28.543
- Back the fuck off!
- Pfft.

918
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:30.211
Show's over, ladies!

919
01:14:33.339 --> 01:14:34.883
Put this maggot back in his cell.

920
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:37.845
Move it! Come on, let's go! Come on!

921
01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:57.197
We'll be seeing you later on tonight,
little sister.

922
01:15:10.919 --> 01:15:12.921
Ow.

923
01:15:47.749 --> 01:15:52.420
"Today, I found
my grandfather's death certificate.

924
01:15:52.587 --> 01:15:55.590
He died in a nuthouse just like my father.

925
01:15:55.757 --> 01:16:00.470
Mom denies it, but she thinks
I'm going to end up the same way."

926
01:16:00.637 --> 01:16:03.224
Boo-hoo-hoo!

927
01:16:11.607 --> 01:16:13.234
- Mine!
- Short!

928
01:16:14.902 --> 01:16:17.196
Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go!

929
01:16:18.614 --> 01:16:19.657
Come on, Reese.

930
01:16:26.038 --> 01:16:27.706
You're religious, Carlos.

931
01:16:28.082 --> 01:16:32.002
You believe in that whole bit,
the Lord works in mysterious ways?

932
01:16:33.462 --> 01:16:34.588
Straight up, man.

933
01:16:35.422 --> 01:16:38.842
Because I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

934
01:16:39.885 --> 01:16:40.928
For you to help me.

935
01:16:42.805 --> 01:16:45.100
Shit.

936
01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.851
I knew you were crazy, man.

937
01:16:47.018 --> 01:16:48.436
I ain't bullshitting you.

938
01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.480
Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.

939
01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:52.899
Oh, yeah?

940
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:55.819
That's cool. Great.

941
01:16:56.528 --> 01:16:59.572
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.

942
01:17:03.076 --> 01:17:07.497
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

943
01:17:07.664 --> 01:17:09.457
You need to see the prison shrink, man.

944
01:17:10.166 --> 01:17:13.044
Just tell me if you see anything just weird.

945
01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.172
Weirder than this?

946
01:17:16.339 --> 01:17:20.218
It could be marks. It could be scars.
It could be anything, I don't know.

947
01:17:22.345 --> 01:17:25.682
<i>On Wednesday, I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.</i>

948
01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:28.101
<i>Mommy won't let me see it.</i>

949
01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:46.245
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

950
01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:51.625
That's great, everyone.

951
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.502
Just imagine what you wanna be.

952
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.713
There's no limits.

953
01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:07.808
Oh, Mrs. Boswell.

954
01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:13.398
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

955
01:18:13.565 --> 01:18:15.817
Look, the stigmata, man.

956
01:18:15.984 --> 01:18:17.944
What'd you see? What'd it look like?

957
01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:21.531
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.

958
01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:26.036
Man, I thought you were-
I thought you were fucking crazy, man.

959
01:18:27.162 --> 01:18:29.081
So now you believe me.

960
01:18:30.916 --> 01:18:32.376
Straight up, man.

961
01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:46.181
Wanna make a deal?

962
01:18:48.934 --> 01:18:51.395
All right, look. I'm new here...

963
01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:53.313
...but I think I get how things work.

964
01:18:54.815 --> 01:18:57.610
You either join a gang or you're dead.

965
01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:02.448
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up
with no spies or niggers.

966
01:19:04.492 --> 01:19:07.662
And I don't wanna die. So...

967
01:19:12.166 --> 01:19:13.292
...what do I gotta do?

968
01:19:14.502 --> 01:19:18.089
I'm the new guy.
I gotta work my way up, so...

969
01:19:19.257 --> 01:19:21.050
...should I...

970
01:19:21.592 --> 01:19:23.344
...suck your dick now...

971
01:19:24.387 --> 01:19:26.722
...or...?

972
01:19:30.393 --> 01:19:33.312
Is your blood pure?

973
01:19:33.479 --> 01:19:37.024
Well, I ain't no fucking kike,
if that's what you're asking me.

974
01:19:37.191 --> 01:19:40.279
Well, then, let's see what you got, honey.

975
01:19:40.904 --> 01:19:43.365
Watch the fucking teeth
or you'll be leaving without them.

976
01:19:43.532 --> 01:19:45.451
Yes, sir.

977
01:19:53.959 --> 01:19:55.711
Come to Daddy.

978
01:19:59.423 --> 01:20:01.842
- Come on!
- Carlos!

979
01:20:08.557 --> 01:20:11.727
"We took the woods behind the junkyard
to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy.

980
01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:14.605
- We hadn't seen the smoke yet."
- Unh!

981
01:20:14.771 --> 01:20:16.815
Hold them. Hold them!

982
01:20:16.982 --> 01:20:20.319
"We took the woods behind the junkyard just
to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy.

983
01:20:20.486 --> 01:20:22.404
We hadn't seen the smoke yet."

984
01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:29.621
Rot in hell, you fucking animals!

985
01:20:30.788 --> 01:20:33.333
Wait, before we-

986
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.377
We need something
that could open the sack.

987
01:20:47.222 --> 01:20:48.473
I want you to take this, Lenny.

988
01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.475
Today's your day of atonement.

989
01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:53.520
I know how guilty you feel
about that woman and her baby.

990
01:20:53.686 --> 01:20:55.605
Evan, stop it. It's not the time.

991
01:20:55.772 --> 01:20:59.150
Now's the only time! Today you
get a chance to redeem yourself...

992
01:20:59.317 --> 01:21:00.985
...to start all over with a clean slate.

993
01:21:01.152 --> 01:21:03.613
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

994
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:07.660
Please, if you've ever trusted me
before, trust me on this one.

995
01:21:11.121 --> 01:21:12.164
Cut the rope.

996
01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.295
Come on.

997
01:21:20.172 --> 01:21:22.967
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.

998
01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:25.302
You don't want me
to see Kayleigh ever again, fine.

999
01:21:25.469 --> 01:21:28.889
Just let Crockett go.
Besides, if you kill him now...

1000
01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:31.141
...they'll stick you in juvie for sure.

1001
01:21:31.308 --> 01:21:34.186
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

1002
01:21:45.447 --> 01:21:46.574
Lenny, no!

1003
01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:51.371
God.

1004
01:21:53.665 --> 01:21:55.625
Oh, God, Lenny.

1005
01:21:55.792 --> 01:21:58.503
I said, cut the rope.

1006
01:22:21.151 --> 01:22:23.737
It's all backwards.

1007
01:22:29.534 --> 01:22:30.660
Ow.

1008
01:22:35.458 --> 01:22:36.918
Evan...

1009
01:22:37.335 --> 01:22:38.919
Who did it?

1010
01:22:41.088 --> 01:22:42.757
What the fuck?

1011
01:22:47.011 --> 01:22:48.054
Lenny, no!

1012
01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:52.850
Want a ride?

1013
01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.478
Lenny!

1014
01:22:59.315 --> 01:23:01.942
Somebody call 911!

1015
01:23:02.318 --> 01:23:04.779
Evan! Evan! Fuck. Evan!

1016
01:23:11.869 --> 01:23:13.454
Hey, doc.

1017
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.831
What's the damage?

1018
01:23:15.998 --> 01:23:18.251
- How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.

1019
01:23:18.835 --> 01:23:20.253
It's a little complicated.

1020
01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.090
I haven't seen results like these before.

1021
01:23:23.256 --> 01:23:25.384
Not even with my father?

1022
01:23:26.093 --> 01:23:29.763
Well, actually, they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

1023
01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.139
So, what did you find?

1024
01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:33.809
We're finding most of the hemorrhaging
is coming from here...

1025
01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:36.228
...the outer layer of the cerebral cortex.

1026
01:23:36.395 --> 01:23:38.105
That's where the memories
are stored, Mom.

1027
01:23:38.271 --> 01:23:39.564
- Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.

1028
01:23:39.731 --> 01:23:41.108
I've never seen anything like it.

1029
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:43.944
We compared these
to the ones taken last year.

1030
01:23:44.111 --> 01:23:47.114
We found severe hemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

1031
01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.950
- And what does that mean for Evan?
- He's saying I've jammed...

1032
01:23:50.117 --> 01:23:52.619
...40 years worth of memories
into my head in the last year.

1033
01:23:52.786 --> 01:23:55.497
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain.

1034
01:23:55.664 --> 01:23:58.542
- That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.

1035
01:24:02.088 --> 01:24:04.674
All right, I'm gonna go wait in the car.

1036
01:24:04.841 --> 01:24:07.260
The light in here is kind
of bugging my eyes, so...

1037
01:24:07.427 --> 01:24:09.220
It was good seeing you, doc. It really was.

1038
01:24:09.387 --> 01:24:13.016
It was very-Very informative.

1039
01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:16.561
But, you know, I got, uh, people to see...

1040
01:24:16.728 --> 01:24:18.396
...and things to read.

1041
01:24:18.563 --> 01:24:20.815
All right, see you.

1042
01:24:52.222 --> 01:24:53.640
Hey.

1043
01:24:56.268 --> 01:24:57.686
It's me...

1044
01:24:57.853 --> 01:24:59.438
...Evan.

1045
01:25:00.814 --> 01:25:02.816
Can I get you anything?

1046
01:25:05.027 --> 01:25:06.904
What about-?
What about some of those...

1047
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:09.448
...model airplanes you like, huh?

1048
01:25:10.532 --> 01:25:13.952
I bet I can get a shitload of
those model airplanes up in here.

1049
01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.332
Lenny.

1050
01:25:26.256 --> 01:25:28.968
You knew the whole time, didn't you?

1051
01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:36.351
When you put that shard in my hand...

1052
01:25:38.269 --> 01:25:41.981
...you knew something big
was gonna happen.

1053
01:25:42.148 --> 01:25:43.983
Didn't you?

1054
01:25:45.318 --> 01:25:47.612
Yeah.

1055
01:25:47.779 --> 01:25:50.907
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

1056
01:25:54.619 --> 01:25:57.497
You should be...

1057
01:25:57.664 --> 01:25:59.541
...where I am.

1058
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.356
"Today I get to meet my father.

1059
01:26:22.815 --> 01:26:25.109
His name is Jason...

1060
01:26:25.901 --> 01:26:28.028
...and he's crazy.

1061
01:26:29.655 --> 01:26:31.907
I hope he lets me call him Dad."

1062
01:26:33.576 --> 01:26:35.828
You okay? Because you look like...

1063
01:26:35.995 --> 01:26:38.038
...you went somewhere else
there for a second.

1064
01:26:38.205 --> 01:26:39.665
Look, Jason...

1065
01:26:39.832 --> 01:26:43.294
...I need some fast answers from you
if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.

1066
01:26:44.253 --> 01:26:46.630
I was praying this curse
would have ended with me.

1067
01:26:46.797 --> 01:26:48.048
Yeah, but it didn't.

1068
01:26:48.215 --> 01:26:50.718
So now I need information
to make things right again...

1069
01:26:50.885 --> 01:26:52.845
...and you're the only one
that can give it to me.

1070
01:26:53.012 --> 01:26:54.096
There is no right.

1071
01:26:54.930 --> 01:26:57.475
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

1072
01:26:57.642 --> 01:26:59.644
Who says
you can't make things better?

1073
01:26:59.811 --> 01:27:03.481
You can't play God, son.

1074
01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:06.067
It must end with me.

1075
01:27:06.234 --> 01:27:08.403
Just by being here,
you may be killing your mother.

1076
01:27:09.738 --> 01:27:11.615
That's bullshit, you know?

1077
01:27:11.781 --> 01:27:15.452
I'll send you a postcard
when I made everything perfect again.

1078
01:27:16.494 --> 01:27:18.496
Aah! No, no!

1079
01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.207
I love-

1080
01:27:40.186 --> 01:27:42.230
Just get out, did you?

1081
01:27:42.396 --> 01:27:44.357
Hmm?

1082
01:27:44.523 --> 01:27:47.777
Oh, nothing, just that my brother
did a stint in the pen...

1083
01:27:47.944 --> 01:27:49.862
...and he used to eat like that. Heh.

1084
01:27:50.738 --> 01:27:53.282
I come from a big family.

1085
01:27:53.449 --> 01:27:55.952
Well, I meant no offense.

1086
01:27:57.161 --> 01:27:58.287
None taken.

1087
01:27:58.746 --> 01:28:00.539
Hey, uh...

1088
01:28:01.332 --> 01:28:03.668
...does Kayleigh Miller still work here?

1089
01:28:04.835 --> 01:28:06.253
I'm sorry. I never heard of her.

1090
01:28:24.147 --> 01:28:28.402
God! Can't a man get a little
goddamn peace in his own house?!

1091
01:28:32.114 --> 01:28:34.533
- I don't suppose you're here to sell cookies.
- Heh, heh.

1092
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.660
Good guess, fuckbag.

1093
01:28:37.202 --> 01:28:40.205
Unh. Remember me, huh?

1094
01:28:40.372 --> 01:28:43.041
We had a nice chat once when I was 7.

1095
01:28:44.459 --> 01:28:46.295
I got one question for you.

1096
01:28:46.461 --> 01:28:48.630
Where can I find your daughter?

1097
01:29:02.102 --> 01:29:04.146
Goddamn liar!

1098
01:29:04.313 --> 01:29:06.733
Goddamn liar!

1099
01:29:22.373 --> 01:29:24.876
Oh, I thought you were someone else.

1100
01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.216
Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.

1101
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:37.388
Hey. It's good to see you.

1102
01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.641
Can I come in?

1103
01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:44.604
If I knew you were coming, I would have
cleaned the stains off the sheets.

1104
01:29:51.195 --> 01:29:53.572
What do you want?

1105
01:29:53.739 --> 01:29:56.158
- I just needed to see a friendly face.
- Oh.

1106
01:29:56.325 --> 01:30:00.412
Well, time is money, Evan, you know?

1107
01:30:00.913 --> 01:30:02.915
Money.

1108
01:30:03.499 --> 01:30:07.336
I guess I can spare 10 minutes
for an old friend, right?

1109
01:30:07.711 --> 01:30:10.589
So, how's tricks?

1110
01:30:10.756 --> 01:30:12.966
Sorry, occupational humor.

1111
01:30:13.175 --> 01:30:15.427
I got it.

1112
01:30:15.594 --> 01:30:17.930
You can stop now.

1113
01:30:18.097 --> 01:30:20.224
Oh, sorry.

1114
01:30:20.391 --> 01:30:23.852
Does my line of work make you
uncomfortable, precious?

1115
01:30:24.019 --> 01:30:27.856
No, just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

1116
01:30:31.443 --> 01:30:36.616
- I've been where you've been.
- Ha! Where is that?

1117
01:30:38.576 --> 01:30:41.204
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1118
01:30:41.371 --> 01:30:44.791
And I know people always say that,
that you wouldn't believe me...

1119
01:30:44.958 --> 01:30:47.961
...but in this case it's not
even worth trying, so...

1120
01:30:49.254 --> 01:30:51.214
Nothing else mattered.

1121
01:30:51.381 --> 01:30:53.633
I knew I needed to find you.

1122
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.470
So I went over to your dad's
and made him tell me where you were.

1123
01:30:57.637 --> 01:30:59.722
Then I came here, and the rest you know.

1124
01:30:59.889 --> 01:31:02.976
- You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
- I never thought you would.

1125
01:31:04.644 --> 01:31:06.938
That's why I never bothered
to tell a soul until now...

1126
01:31:07.105 --> 01:31:11.401
- ...and I never will again.
- I'm the only person you've told?

1127
01:31:11.943 --> 01:31:14.070
That's a great line.

1128
01:31:14.237 --> 01:31:16.614
Does that make other girls wet?

1129
01:31:16.781 --> 01:31:19.410
Do they actually eat up that bullshit?

1130
01:31:22.079 --> 01:31:26.292
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

1131
01:31:26.459 --> 01:31:29.336
Frankly, I'm too tired to prove it to you-

1132
01:31:29.503 --> 01:31:32.131
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

1133
01:31:33.048 --> 01:31:35.968
How else would I know you have
twin moles on your inner thigh?

1134
01:31:36.135 --> 01:31:38.804
Anyone with 50 bucks could tell you that.

1135
01:31:38.971 --> 01:31:40.681
Okay.

1136
01:31:40.848 --> 01:31:42.933
Forget that.

1137
01:31:43.392 --> 01:31:47.855
How about the fact that you prefer
the smell of skunk to flowers?

1138
01:31:48.022 --> 01:31:50.149
Or that you hate cilantro...

1139
01:31:50.316 --> 01:31:52.026
...because for some reason
unknown to you...

1140
01:31:52.193 --> 01:31:54.570
...it reminds you of your stepsister?

1141
01:31:54.737 --> 01:31:58.324
Or that when you have an orgasm,
your toes go numb?

1142
01:31:58.491 --> 01:32:01.369
I'm sure all of your clientele
are privy to that.

1143
01:32:04.289 --> 01:32:05.790
You know?

1144
01:32:05.957 --> 01:32:07.918
Look, I just thought you should know.

1145
01:32:08.585 --> 01:32:10.003
Know what?

1146
01:32:11.129 --> 01:32:13.340
That you were happy once...

1147
01:32:14.257 --> 01:32:15.467
...with me.

1148
01:32:17.469 --> 01:32:20.305
You know, there's one
major hole in your story.

1149
01:32:20.472 --> 01:32:23.642
There's no fucking way
on this planet or any other...

1150
01:32:23.808 --> 01:32:26.144
...I would ever be
in some fucking sorority!

1151
01:32:30.565 --> 01:32:33.985
- You were happy there.
- Oh, you're crying?

1152
01:32:34.152 --> 01:32:36.321
You sure you don't want your wallet?

1153
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:38.698
No, I don't need it where I'm going.

1154
01:32:38.865 --> 01:32:41.952
What, are you off to change
everyone else's life again? Is that it?

1155
01:32:42.118 --> 01:32:44.621
Maybe next time
you'll pop up in some mansion...

1156
01:32:44.788 --> 01:32:47.291
...while I end up in Tijuana
doing some donkey act.

1157
01:32:47.959 --> 01:32:49.877
You know what? I'm over it.

1158
01:32:50.044 --> 01:32:52.338
Every time I try to help someone...

1159
01:32:52.505 --> 01:32:54.006
...everything just goes to shit.

1160
01:32:54.549 --> 01:32:56.509
Well, don't give up now, Slick.

1161
01:32:56.717 --> 01:32:58.886
Hell, you've already
done so much for me.

1162
01:32:59.053 --> 01:33:00.930
Why don't you go back in time...

1163
01:33:01.097 --> 01:33:04.308
...and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby?

1164
01:33:04.475 --> 01:33:09.188
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family.

1165
01:33:09.397 --> 01:33:11.941
No, go back to when I was 7...

1166
01:33:12.108 --> 01:33:16.696
...and fuck me in front
of my daddy's video camera.

1167
01:33:16.862 --> 01:33:18.781
Straighten me out a bit.

1168
01:33:33.505 --> 01:33:35.799
You're on my bed. Get out!

1169
01:33:35.966 --> 01:33:39.928
Buddy, I thought it'd be okay
what with you being sick and all.

1170
01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.941
I'm not gonna say it again.

1171
01:34:00.115 --> 01:34:02.826
<i>The last thing I remember before
the blackout was holding my hands...</i>

1172
01:34:02.993 --> 01:34:06.788
<i>...over Kayleigh's ears. I think I was
more focused on her hands on mine...</i>

1173
01:34:06.955 --> 01:34:09.124
<i>...than the mailbox across the street.</i>

1174
01:34:15.923 --> 01:34:18.593
Lady, stay back! Don't go near the mailbox!

1175
01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.429
- Idiot!
- I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

1176
01:34:21.638 --> 01:34:23.806
I'll save you, lady!

1177
01:34:29.479 --> 01:34:31.564
Slow down, slow down.

1178
01:34:31.731 --> 01:34:34.651
Goddamn it.
I thought I told you two to get out.

1179
01:34:35.735 --> 01:34:37.612
Oh, sorry, man. Did we wake you?

1180
01:34:40.198 --> 01:34:42.617
No, it's cool.

1181
01:34:42.784 --> 01:34:44.619
Okay.

1182
01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:50.958
It's really cool. Ha-ha-ha.

1183
01:35:09.895 --> 01:35:12.147
What the fuck is this?

1184
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.864
- Please save his arm.
- Can you open up my locker?

1185
01:35:21.031 --> 01:35:23.158
- Happy birthday!
- Where do you wanna go now?

1186
01:35:23.325 --> 01:35:26.662
- Can I come too?
- You want me to hold your popcorn?

1187
01:35:26.829 --> 01:35:29.832
Evan. Evan? Get a towel! Get a towel!

1188
01:35:29.998 --> 01:35:31.834
Evan! Oh, my God.

1189
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.336
Evan! Evan! Evan!

1190
01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:36.922
Hey, where you going?

1191
01:35:37.089 --> 01:35:39.801
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.

1192
01:35:39.968 --> 01:35:41.678
Lenny's the best.

1193
01:35:41.845 --> 01:35:43.888
You guys make a great couple.

1194
01:35:44.055 --> 01:35:45.932
You ever think that I'll find someone?

1195
01:35:47.725 --> 01:35:49.436
Evan!

1196
01:35:52.647 --> 01:35:56.067
- Unh. Where are we going?
- We're taking you to the hospital, Evan.

1197
01:35:56.234 --> 01:35:59.863
- No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mom would kill me.

1198
01:36:01.698 --> 01:36:04.033
- Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny!

1199
01:36:06.369 --> 01:36:08.830
You owe me that much.

1200
01:36:12.542 --> 01:36:14.085
What are you geeks looking at?

1201
01:36:14.252 --> 01:36:16.921
It must be nice to be
so goddamn perfect, huh?!

1202
01:36:17.088 --> 01:36:20.425
You fucking losers! Lenny, help me!

1203
01:36:20.592 --> 01:36:23.011
God. Here, get him over. Get him over.

1204
01:36:24.013 --> 01:36:27.308
Hey, Brian, how's your head feeling, buddy?

1205
01:36:27.475 --> 01:36:29.101
I saw that girl you went home with.

1206
01:36:29.268 --> 01:36:31.228
Did she borrow your razor this morning?

1207
01:36:31.395 --> 01:36:34.064
You're so bad.

1208
01:36:34.231 --> 01:36:37.401
Hey, there's Tommy. Hey, Tommy! Tommy!

1209
01:36:37.985 --> 01:36:40.237
Hey, what's up, guys?

1210
01:36:41.572 --> 01:36:43.491
Hey, man, I did what you said.

1211
01:36:43.657 --> 01:36:45.868
We're pooling our student funds
with the Hillel House...

1212
01:36:46.035 --> 01:36:48.370
- ...and we're having an awareness dance.
- Oh.

1213
01:36:48.537 --> 01:36:50.998
Awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around...

1214
01:36:51.165 --> 01:36:53.375
...to a techno remix of "Hava Nagila"
till I puke.

1215
01:36:55.085 --> 01:36:56.796
Maybe we should be getting to class now.

1216
01:36:56.962 --> 01:36:58.631
What's the point of psych class now?

1217
01:36:58.839 --> 01:37:02.426
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh. Heh.

1218
01:37:02.593 --> 01:37:04.762
Let's go for a stroll.

1219
01:37:05.888 --> 01:37:06.932
Bye, babe.

1220
01:37:07.098 --> 01:37:08.850
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis.

1221
01:37:09.017 --> 01:37:10.435
What's up with him?

1222
01:37:10.602 --> 01:37:13.355
So Tommy's really
into this Jesus freak thing, huh?

1223
01:37:13.522 --> 01:37:15.148
You know how spiritual he's gotten...

1224
01:37:15.315 --> 01:37:18.318
...ever since he saved
Mrs. Halpern and Katie.

1225
01:37:19.444 --> 01:37:21.988
He saved Mrs. Halpern?

1226
01:37:22.155 --> 01:37:24.741
Please. The twisted fuck.

1227
01:37:25.659 --> 01:37:28.537
Here, why don't we sit right here?

1228
01:37:35.710 --> 01:37:37.671
Want a granola bar?

1229
01:37:40.173 --> 01:37:41.716
Here, just-

1230
01:37:45.846 --> 01:37:48.849
Yeah, I gotta fix these things or something.

1231
01:37:51.143 --> 01:37:53.104
Kayleigh...

1232
01:37:53.271 --> 01:37:55.022
...do you ever think about us?

1233
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:57.441
I mean, do you ever wonder...

1234
01:37:57.608 --> 01:38:01.195
...if things might have been
different between us?

1235
01:38:01.362 --> 01:38:03.281
Sure, Evan.

1236
01:38:05.408 --> 01:38:07.910
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

1237
01:38:09.912 --> 01:38:12.373
- I was?
- Yeah.

1238
01:38:13.457 --> 01:38:17.461
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

1239
01:38:18.296 --> 01:38:20.047
I don't get it.

1240
01:38:20.214 --> 01:38:22.300
When my folks split up...

1241
01:38:22.466 --> 01:38:25.428
...they gave me and Tommy a choice
of who we wanted to live with.

1242
01:38:25.595 --> 01:38:28.180
And I couldn't stand my dad.

1243
01:38:28.347 --> 01:38:31.100
But I knew that
if I went to move with my mom...

1244
01:38:31.267 --> 01:38:33.394
...I'd never see you again.

1245
01:38:34.146 --> 01:38:35.856
I didn't know that.

1246
01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:40.652
So you still think about us...

1247
01:38:40.819 --> 01:38:42.821
...together?

1248
01:38:44.156 --> 01:38:47.618
Well, it's crossed my mind
from time to time.

1249
01:38:47.784 --> 01:38:49.828
- And?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1250
01:38:50.329 --> 01:38:52.664
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind, Ev.

1251
01:38:52.831 --> 01:38:55.751
I mean, I could play out
the entire movie of our lives...

1252
01:38:55.917 --> 01:38:59.963
...in one second. Boom, we fall in love,
we get married. We have kids.

1253
01:39:00.130 --> 01:39:03.091
Our kids grow old, as do we.

1254
01:39:03.258 --> 01:39:06.720
Matching burial plots. The whole thing. Heh.

1255
01:39:06.887 --> 01:39:10.223
Plah, it took a lot longer
to spit out than to imagine.

1256
01:39:12.059 --> 01:39:14.603
Things like that usually do.

1257
01:39:16.897 --> 01:39:17.941
So...

1258
01:39:18.733 --> 01:39:20.693
...do you think that it might have worked?

1259
01:39:21.152 --> 01:39:22.987
Yeah.

1260
01:39:24.781 --> 01:39:27.700
I mean, but that's not how things wound up.

1261
01:39:29.285 --> 01:39:30.453
I'm with Lenny.

1262
01:39:32.789 --> 01:39:35.124
Lenny is your friend...

1263
01:39:37.251 --> 01:39:38.962
...and that's where it ends.

1264
01:39:41.714 --> 01:39:43.633
Well...

1265
01:39:44.676 --> 01:39:48.429
...would it make a
difference if I told you that...

1266
01:39:48.596 --> 01:39:51.933
...no one could possibly ever love anyone
as much as I love you?

1267
01:40:00.984 --> 01:40:04.446
You know, I'm not saying that. I don't-

1268
01:40:04.613 --> 01:40:08.367
- Yeah.
- You know. I'm not-I'm just saying it like...

1269
01:40:08.534 --> 01:40:11.203
...if you were a girl,
would that be something...

1270
01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:13.580
...that you would wanna hear?

1271
01:40:16.959 --> 01:40:18.544
Hold on one second. Lenny's calling.

1272
01:40:18.711 --> 01:40:21.046
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

1273
01:40:27.136 --> 01:40:29.096
He's a little down. He'll be all right.

1274
01:40:29.847 --> 01:40:30.889
All right.

1275
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:30.659
Oh, my-You forgot to put
the toaster on the ledge.

1276
01:41:31.702 --> 01:41:34.288
Lenny likes Pop-Tarts.

1277
01:41:35.331 --> 01:41:37.333
You guys are all that matter now.

1278
01:41:39.543 --> 01:41:42.922
Man, I know it's hard, but you can't give up.

1279
01:41:43.089 --> 01:41:45.132
I can't even fucking kill myself.

1280
01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:47.134
Don't talk like that.

1281
01:41:57.102 --> 01:41:59.396
All right, I gotta get you out of here.

1282
01:41:59.563 --> 01:42:02.191
Visiting hours are almost over.

1283
01:42:05.736 --> 01:42:08.155
Did Mom get transferred again?

1284
01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:11.408
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

1285
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.962
Looking... good, kiddo.

1286
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:29.594
What the hell?

1287
01:42:31.805 --> 01:42:32.848
Lung cancer.

1288
01:42:34.975 --> 01:42:37.936
You started chain-smoking
when I blew myself up.

1289
01:42:38.103 --> 01:42:40.522
Sorry, Mrs. T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

1290
01:42:40.689 --> 01:42:43.692
- I think I could fix this.
- Fix?

1291
01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:48.572
I just need the journal entry
about the blockbuster and-

1292
01:42:49.364 --> 01:42:53.535
Shit, no arms. I never wrote it.

1293
01:42:53.702 --> 01:42:58.207
You're... acting different.

1294
01:42:58.374 --> 01:43:01.085
No, he's just going through
tough times right now.

1295
01:43:02.253 --> 01:43:06.465
Mom, you're gonna be okay.
I can change it.

1296
01:43:06.632 --> 01:43:09.677
Um, maybe-
I'm gonna go down to the chapel.

1297
01:43:11.012 --> 01:43:15.099
You're... acting...

1298
01:43:15.266 --> 01:43:18.519
...just like your father.

1299
01:43:18.686 --> 01:43:22.023
Just because he went crazy
when he was my age...

1300
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:25.276
...doesn't mean I'm gonna go crazy, Mom.

1301
01:43:25.943 --> 01:43:29.530
How... did...

1302
01:43:29.697 --> 01:43:32.533
...you... know that?

1303
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:35.119
You told me...

1304
01:43:35.286 --> 01:43:37.538
...on Parents' Weekend, remember?

1305
01:43:42.044 --> 01:43:44.129
It wasn't me.

1306
01:43:44.296 --> 01:43:49.885
- Just... like... Jason.
- Or you.

1307
01:43:50.469 --> 01:43:51.929
You don't worry, Mom.

1308
01:43:52.095 --> 01:43:54.598
I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?

1309
01:43:54.765 --> 01:43:56.433
No.

1310
01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:00.145
You're not gonna hurt any more.
I'm gonna fix it.

1311
01:44:00.312 --> 01:44:01.355
No.

1312
01:44:02.522 --> 01:44:05.400
No, no.

1313
01:44:08.028 --> 01:44:09.529
Are you sure you even packed it?

1314
01:44:09.696 --> 01:44:11.365
My mom packed it.

1315
01:44:11.531 --> 01:44:13.533
I think she sent everything I ever owned.

1316
01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:15.702
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

1317
01:44:15.869 --> 01:44:17.746
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.

1318
01:44:17.913 --> 01:44:19.539
Duly noted.

1319
01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:24.545
Okay, I have to ask you one last favour.

1320
01:44:24.712 --> 01:44:26.673
- What?
- I need you to be quiet.

1321
01:44:27.257 --> 01:44:29.592
I have to concentrate
if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.

1322
01:44:30.176 --> 01:44:33.554
- What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms...

1323
01:44:33.721 --> 01:44:36.516
...my mom would've never
started smoking in the first place.

1324
01:44:36.683 --> 01:44:38.768
- You-
- Never mind. Just open it.

1325
01:44:40.895 --> 01:44:43.439
Turn it. There.

1326
01:44:48.736 --> 01:44:52.573
<i>Today Mommy is taking me to play
with Kayleigh and Tommy.</i>

1327
01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:56.619
<i>I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.</i>

1328
01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.333
Now, how do I destroy the blockbuster?

1329
01:45:16.682 --> 01:45:20.477
Evan, what are you doing with that knife?

1330
01:45:23.856 --> 01:45:28.360
Well, that didn't work. Go on, turn it.

1331
01:45:29.069 --> 01:45:30.779
Turn it. There.

1332
01:45:32.656 --> 01:45:35.034
"I never wanted to be in the movie, anyway.

1333
01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:39.705
And I was cold, so I wanted to wear my clothes.
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off."

1334
01:45:39.872 --> 01:45:41.415
In this part of the story...

1335
01:45:41.582 --> 01:45:45.586
...Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian.

1336
01:45:45.753 --> 01:45:48.589
And they have to kiss and stuff...

1337
01:45:48.756 --> 01:45:50.049
...like grown-ups do.

1338
01:45:50.215 --> 01:45:52.427
Wait, I need my belt.

1339
01:45:59.476 --> 01:46:02.270
Hey, don't even bother about a belt.

1340
01:46:02.771 --> 01:46:05.523
- Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.

1341
01:46:05.690 --> 01:46:09.069
Amazing that word never fails
to make an impression with you.

1342
01:46:09.235 --> 01:46:11.654
Heh. Easy does it, Evan.

1343
01:46:11.821 --> 01:46:14.449
Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell your mother...

1344
01:46:14.616 --> 01:46:16.493
...what a naughty little shit you are.

1345
01:46:16.659 --> 01:46:20.997
And I'll tell Child Protective Services
about your little kiddie porn endeavors.

1346
01:46:21.164 --> 01:46:23.374
One step closer
and I'll shove this up your ass.

1347
01:46:23.541 --> 01:46:25.835
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hands.

1348
01:46:26.002 --> 01:46:28.296
Been there, done that.

1349
01:46:30.548 --> 01:46:31.758
Hey!

1350
01:46:35.721 --> 01:46:37.390
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!

1351
01:46:38.724 --> 01:46:41.018
No! Kayleigh, no!

1352
01:46:48.317 --> 01:46:49.610
Hey, man.

1353
01:46:51.946 --> 01:46:53.239
Good, kiddo.

1354
01:46:53.405 --> 01:46:55.908
I've got no choice but to commit you
to Sunnyvale Institution...

1355
01:46:56.075 --> 01:46:58.702
Evan, you're gonna have
to live somewhere else for a while.

1356
01:46:58.869 --> 01:47:00.371
A squashed butterfly.
Where's my mommy?

1357
01:47:00.538 --> 01:47:01.956
I'm so sick of this!

1358
01:47:02.123 --> 01:47:03.541
Maybe we should up your medication.

1359
01:47:03.707 --> 01:47:05.918
I have my medication.

1360
01:47:33.738 --> 01:47:35.574
- Where are my goddamn books?
- Hey, Evan.

1361
01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:38.743
We're not supposed
to meet for another hour.

1362
01:47:39.327 --> 01:47:41.580
Where are my goddamn books?

1363
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:47.586
- Books?
- My journals. I-I need them.

1364
01:47:47.752 --> 01:47:51.923
So if you'd give them to me, it'd help a lot.

1365
01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:54.593
It really hurts me to go through this again.

1366
01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:57.304
There are no journals.

1367
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:59.389
There never were.

1368
01:47:59.556 --> 01:48:02.101
It's part of the fantasy world
that your mind created...

1369
01:48:02.268 --> 01:48:05.688
...to cope with the guilt
of killing Kayleigh Miller.

1370
01:48:05.855 --> 01:48:08.816
Think, Evan, think.

1371
01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:12.028
You've created a disease
that does not exist...

1372
01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:17.283
...alternate universes with colleges
and prisons and paraplegia.

1373
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:20.077
I want my journals and I want them now!

1374
01:48:20.244 --> 01:48:22.914
And I know that you got them
and you're gonna give them to me!

1375
01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.125
You're not gonna hide them from me!
I want them!

1376
01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:30.254
You're reminding me of your father.

1377
01:48:30.421 --> 01:48:32.173
He was always screaming
for a photo album...

1378
01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:35.009
...even though he never had one.

1379
01:48:35.885 --> 01:48:37.428
I'm so sorry.

1380
01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:39.180
I'm-

1381
01:48:41.766 --> 01:48:43.809
A photo album?

1382
01:48:43.976 --> 01:48:46.855
- Photos.
- Evan?

1383
01:48:50.025 --> 01:48:52.069
The damage is irreparable.

1384
01:48:58.033 --> 01:49:01.703
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

1385
01:49:10.712 --> 01:49:12.965
Mom?

1386
01:49:13.131 --> 01:49:16.134
Um, did you remember to bring...

1387
01:49:16.301 --> 01:49:19.137
...those home movies that we used to make?

1388
01:49:19.846 --> 01:49:21.765
Yeah, they're right here.

1389
01:49:23.058 --> 01:49:27.854
Good, because I'd really like
to watch them.

1390
01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.944
So that's good.

1391
01:49:37.532 --> 01:49:42.036
I think it's best we transfer him
to Belleview first thing in the morning.

1392
01:50:24.163 --> 01:50:27.207
If anyone finds this...

1393
01:50:27.374 --> 01:50:31.670
...it means that my plan didn't work...

1394
01:50:31.837 --> 01:50:34.423
...and I'm already dead.

1395
01:50:36.759 --> 01:50:38.969
He's not in his room. Search the grounds.

1396
01:50:39.136 --> 01:50:41.347
If I can somehow go back...

1397
01:50:41.513 --> 01:50:44.600
- Check that one across the hall,
- ...to the beginning of all of this...

1398
01:50:44.767 --> 01:50:49.521
- Evan!
- ...I might be able to save her.

1399
01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:51.357
Evan!

1400
01:50:52.983 --> 01:50:55.486
- Over here.
- Evan!

1401
01:50:56.321 --> 01:50:57.989
I think he's in here.

1402
01:50:58.365 --> 01:51:00.325
Evan!

1403
01:51:00.492 --> 01:51:01.701
<i>Jason, cut it out.</i>

1404
01:51:02.035 --> 01:51:05.497
<i>- I'm trying to have a baby. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.</i>

1405
01:51:08.958 --> 01:51:10.919
Come out! Come on out!

1406
01:51:15.715 --> 01:51:17.926
<i>Go away.</i>

1407
01:51:31.981 --> 01:51:33.149
Something's wrong!

1408
01:51:33.316 --> 01:51:34.984
It's killing me!

1409
01:51:36.528 --> 01:51:39.572
- Make it stop!
- Cord's entangled.

1410
01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:41.992
Heart rate is decelerating.

1411
01:51:42.159 --> 01:51:43.702
What's happening?

1412
01:51:43.869 --> 01:51:46.038
<i>You have no lifeline, no soul.</i>

1413
01:51:46.205 --> 01:51:47.540
<i>You were never meant to be.</i>

1414
01:51:47.873 --> 01:51:49.041
He's choking himself.

1415
01:51:49.208 --> 01:51:50.835
No!

1416
01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:53.045
Okay, let's do a rapid sequence intubation...

1417
01:51:53.212 --> 01:51:56.382
- ...for a C-section, stat!
- Save him!

1418
01:51:56.966 --> 01:51:59.093
Not getting enough oxygen!
We're losing him.

1419
01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:01.679
- We're losing him!
- No!

1420
01:52:01.846 --> 01:52:03.806
<i>Before you were born...</i>

1421
01:52:03.973 --> 01:52:06.392
<i>...I was pregnant three times...</i>

1422
01:52:06.559 --> 01:52:08.811
<i>...but they were all stillbirths.</i>

1423
01:52:08.978 --> 01:52:12.148
<i>I've kind of thought of you
as my miracle baby ever since.</i>

1424
01:52:14.525 --> 01:52:15.776
Not again!

1425
01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:18.904
No!

1426
01:52:20.573 --> 01:52:22.950
<i>I couldn't stand my dad...</i>

1427
01:52:23.117 --> 01:52:27.038
<i>...but I knew that if I went
to live with my mom...</i>

1428
01:52:27.205 --> 01:52:28.707
<i>...I'd never see you again.</i>

1429
01:52:56.735 --> 01:53:00.989
- Kayleigh, Tommy! Oh, my God!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1430
01:53:01.156 --> 01:53:03.950
<i>I missed you, I missed you.</i>

1431
01:53:04.117 --> 01:53:07.413
<i>I'll never let you guys
out of my sight again.</i>

1432
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:21.427
Yeah!

1433
01:53:24.722 --> 01:53:27.308
True happiness can only be
achieved through sacrifice...

1434
01:53:27.475 --> 01:53:30.186
...like the sacrifices our parents
have made for us to be here today.

1435
01:53:31.312 --> 01:53:34.524
Whoo-hoo! All right, Tommy!
