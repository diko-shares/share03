1
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.149
This spot is beautiful.

2
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.420
Yeah, it really is.

3
00:00:53.494 --> 00:00:56.327
You guys are lucky. I didn't have
a place like this where I grew up.

4
00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:58.831
What are you talking about?
You grew up like half an hour from here.

5
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.528
Whatever. My parents
didn't let me out much.

6
00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:04.196
Yeah, well, it was
really amazing for us.

7
00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.139
In high school we used to sneak out
and come here all the time.

8
00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:09.199
That's right.
Late-night rendezvous. In fact,

9
00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:13.338
we shared our first bottle
of tequila right here at this very spot.

10
00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:16.747
Wow. I am impressed
that you even remember that.

11
00:01:16.818 --> 00:01:19.252
"I am impressed that
you even remember that."

12
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.845
So do you guys feel like
you were the same as you were back then?

13
00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:23.914
Well, I know I'm
exactly the same.

14
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:26.858
I still have absolutely no idea what
I want to do when I grow up.

15
00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:29.692
Well, hey, you used to
work at Foot Locker, and I'm sure

16
00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:31.789
if you went back and asked,
they'd give you the job.

17
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.027
- Very funny.
- What about you, Nick?

18
00:01:34.102 --> 00:01:36.400
- Have you changed much?
- Mmm-mm.

19
00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.099
Although I must say,
Trevor has gotten way hotter.

20
00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:44.008
You know that that is a fact,
my friend, okay?

21
00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:46.546
My jaw is way wider now.
It's striking.

22
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.410
All right, loverboy.
How about you and me

23
00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.645
go get some wood
for this fire, huh?

24
00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:55.686
All right,
take care.

25
00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.919
I got a really good feeling about
the next couple of months.

26
00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:01.154
Yeah? Why is that?

27
00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.823
If we just close a couple
of our own accounts,

28
00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:06.059
you know how huge
that could be for us?

29
00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:11.604
Yeah, I mean, retiring early
would be very nice.

30
00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:13.606
By 30?

31
00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:16.234
Oh, shit.
Look, look.

32
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.436
Gross, dude.

33
00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:19.503
Come here. What, you
afraid of a little crab?

34
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.104
Gross, dude!
Those things are just sick! Don't!

35
00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.673
- Come on. Come on.
- No, don't! Dude, don't! Don't!

36
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:25.275
Fucking pussy.

37
00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:29.119
This is so exciting!

38
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.658
Yeah. Maybe I should
wait till tomorrow.

39
00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:34.627
No, you have to
tell him tonight.

40
00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:36.629
Hey. Took you guys
long enough.

41
00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:38.756
What are you
talking about?

42
00:02:40.902 --> 00:02:42.460
There it goes.
There it goes. Okay, ready?

43
00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.097
Nice. Yeah, I'm ready.

44
00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:47.698
- Happy birthday!
- Oh!

45
00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:50.266
- Oh, they went out. Relight.
- Wait wait.

46
00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:53.177
- All right.
- Okay, now make a wish.

47
00:02:53.247 --> 00:02:55.477
I can't.
Everything's perfect.

48
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.949
- That's lame.
- Oh. Oh, sweetie.

49
00:02:57.018 --> 00:02:58.110
Whatever, dude.

50
00:02:58.186 --> 00:02:59.881
If you need something,
I've got a whole list of things.

51
00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:02.013
- How about a million dollars?
- Blow 'em out, already.

52
00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.250
- Let's do this.
- All right, all right!

53
00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:06.156
- Yay!
- No!

54
00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.957
- Come on. No. I bought 'em.
- It's my birthday cake.

55
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.328
- I want it in the shot.
- In what shot?

56
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.266
- Good idea, okay.
- Behave.

57
00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:15.393
- Okay, everybody.
- Come on, hurry up, I want a cupcake.

58
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.335
I know, just hold your horses
for a minute, all right?

59
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.340
- Art. It's perfection.
- It's kinda ghetto frosting.

60
00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.069
- That's good though.
- That's my favorite.

61
00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:23.474
Yup. Are you ready?

62
00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:25.603
Yes.

63
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.672
- Everybody say "chingas."
- Chingas.

64
00:03:31.352 --> 00:03:33.752
- Good, guys.
- Chingas.

65
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:36.119
Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.021
I brought my own
special kind of birthday candle.

67
00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.185
- All right.
- Drugs!

68
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.853
- You kids have fun.
- That is awesome.

69
00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.830
- Light it up.
- Come here.

70
00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:48.035
- Hey, where are you going?
- Somewhere.

71
00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:50.229
- Really?
- With you.

72
00:03:50.304 --> 00:03:52.602
- Okay.
- Camera, please.

73
00:03:52.673 --> 00:03:54.937
- Yes, sir.
- Put this on.

74
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.603
- All right.
- This is kind of exciting.

75
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.776
- Oh, I will now be blindfolding you.
- Really?

76
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:07.719
- Are you going to take advantage of me?
- Mm, I might.

77
00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:11.087
- All right, hold this.
- Okay.

78
00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:13.820
- And...
- Oh!

79
00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:16.261
- We shall return.
- See you later.

80
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.560
Don't worry
about me.

81
00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:24.870
- Open.
- Oh.

82
00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:29.037
Remember the first time
we came here?

83
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.670
Yeah. What was that,
like three years ago?

84
00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:32.906
Yeah.

85
00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.418
Nick, um,
there's something

86
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.511
that I want to
tell you.

87
00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:42.556
Me first.

88
00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:45.692
Happy birthday.

89
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.422
Nick! Oh!

90
00:04:49.964 --> 00:04:54.094
- It's beautiful.
- Wish it was a diamond, but...

91
00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:57.035
Well, I love it.
I love you.

92
00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:03.137
Here, put it on.

93
00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:09.513
So, tell me again I'm not crazy and I
shouldn't go get my master's.

94
00:05:09.584 --> 00:05:11.984
Oh, no, you should.
You should go pay some

95
00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:14.544
art-school lifer
to grade your pictures.

96
00:05:14.622 --> 00:05:17.557
I don't have to pay them.
I can use my grant money.

97
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.923
You get the point.

98
00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:24.226
And more importantly, it's in New York,
which is 3,000 miles away from me.

99
00:05:24.298 --> 00:05:25.526
I know.

100
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.160
My job is about to blow up.
I promise you.

101
00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:30.601
I'm gonna have the money so we can
open your own gallery.

102
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.401
You can shoot
your own pictures,

103
00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:36.307
just like we
talked about.

104
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:39.540
- Isn't that what you want?
- Of course.

105
00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.820
This is perfect.

106
00:05:47.888 --> 00:05:49.753
- Hey, don't get that, okay?
- Hey. Oh, where is it?

107
00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:51.223
Remember, I wanted to
tell you something.

108
00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:53.852
I know.
Just give me one second.

109
00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.499
It's work.
Hold on.

110
00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.933
Hello?

111
00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:04.471
Yeah.

112
00:06:04.538 --> 00:06:06.506
Oh, okay.

113
00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:11.602
Right. No no no, it's not...
it's not a problem.

114
00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:15.040
All right.
Bye-bye.

115
00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:20.079
It was Bristol.
I have to go to work.

116
00:06:20.154 --> 00:06:23.055
Yeah, and it's my birthday,
so call him back,

117
00:06:23.124 --> 00:06:24.785
tell him you're sick.
You just can't go.

118
00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:28.454
Listen.
If you do this for me,

119
00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:30.588
we will come back
here next year,

120
00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:32.656
and we will stay
the whole weekend,

121
00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:35.065
and we'll get
a hotel room, and...

122
00:06:36.904 --> 00:06:38.872
Baby?

123
00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:43.569
Help me out here. I really need to go
to this meeting.

124
00:06:45.713 --> 00:06:47.681
No, forget it.

125
00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:52.986
I want a week.

126
00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:57.488
- A week?
- That's right.

127
00:06:57.558 --> 00:07:00.959
You and me
and no cell phones.

128
00:07:02.363 --> 00:07:05.093
You can personally

129
00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.760
smash this thing
before we leave.

130
00:07:07.835 --> 00:07:09.894
How's that?

131
00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:13.540
Okay.

132
00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:17.106
Actually, you know what?
Why wait? I say...

133
00:07:17.178 --> 00:07:19.146
we just drown this thing now
to make sure.

134
00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:21.875
Oh! Oh! Oh, that's...
I don't think so.

135
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:27.852
Give us something
to talk about

136
00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:31.358
Take your time...

137
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:40.730
Aw, shit. Baby, did you remember
my sunglasses?

138
00:07:40.801 --> 00:07:42.792
Mm? What would you
do without me?

139
00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:48.798
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

140
00:07:48.876 --> 00:07:51.242
Yeah, a dick who's gonna
get promoted instead of me

141
00:07:51.312 --> 00:07:52.336
if I flake on this meeting.

142
00:07:52.413 --> 00:07:55.940
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays then?
- And Julie's birthday.

143
00:07:56.016 --> 00:07:58.985
If I want to beat 'em,
I have to join 'em.

144
00:07:59.053 --> 00:08:01.283
- Right now!
- Don't.

145
00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:04.813
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
just should blow the whole thing off.

146
00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:07.884
Yeah, you know, you're right.
I don't need this job anyway.

147
00:08:07.962 --> 00:08:10.760
Great idea. And when you get fired
I'm sure Trevor will last

148
00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:13.299
about two weeks
at work without you.

149
00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:15.358
Why do you
have to say that?

150
00:08:15.436 --> 00:08:18.234
Wait, guys.
Hold up, hold up.

151
00:08:20.908 --> 00:08:23.877
Okay.
Nice.

152
00:08:25.646 --> 00:08:27.637
You know what, baby?
You can move to New York with me,

153
00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:29.478
and we could be
starving artists together.

154
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.983
Wouldn't that be perfect, hon?

155
00:08:31.051 --> 00:08:32.780
Sounds like you
have it all worked out.

156
00:08:33.954 --> 00:08:36.149
Shit!
Hold on!

157
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.452
Oh God!

158
00:08:43.264 --> 00:08:46.028
- Is everyone all right?
- You okay? You okay?

159
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.034
- I think so.
- Are you sure?

160
00:08:48.102 --> 00:08:50.593
- Oh! Oh God!
- Oh, shit!

161
00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:54.770
Nick, move! Ah!

162
00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:09.081
Nick.

163
00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:11.413
Oh, Nick.

164
00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:13.419
Shh.

165
00:10:15.222 --> 00:10:17.019
Shh. Shh.

166
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:19.184
Nick, it's okay.

167
00:10:24.164 --> 00:10:27.258
Room 9, we've got a code blue.
He's gone into attack.

168
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:31.464
190 and rising.

169
00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:37.975
Shh, Nick.
Shh.

170
00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:40.036
Nick...

171
00:10:43.284 --> 00:10:45.878
It's okay.

172
00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:54.254
He gets nightmares
sometimes.

173
00:10:55.362 --> 00:10:57.660
He always has.

174
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.860
Nick.

175
00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:33.900
Oh, Nick!

176
00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:50.573
Where's Julie?

177
00:11:50.651 --> 00:11:53.415
Honey, she's...

178
00:11:55.456 --> 00:11:58.254
- Where are they?
- They didn't...

179
00:11:58.325 --> 00:12:00.555
- No. No.
- Nick...

180
00:12:16.744 --> 00:12:18.075
Okay, everybody.

181
00:12:18.145 --> 00:12:20.079
- Just hold your horses for a minute.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

182
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.955
- Yay! Come on!
- No!

183
00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:44.737
You know what? I cannot imagine
my life without you now.

184
00:13:01.255 --> 00:13:03.621
You know, I was thinking...
if you, um...

185
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.853
if you really need a change
of scenery or whatever,

186
00:13:06.927 --> 00:13:09.794
I've got some extra
room at my place.

187
00:13:09.863 --> 00:13:12.263
For what?

188
00:13:12.332 --> 00:13:14.823
You.

189
00:13:14.902 --> 00:13:17.928
I want you
to live with me.

190
00:14:08.655 --> 00:14:10.850
Nick, it's Mom.

191
00:14:10.924 --> 00:14:13.722
How you feeling?
I spoke to the doctor.

192
00:14:13.794 --> 00:14:16.592
He said you canceled
your appointment again.

193
00:14:16.663 --> 00:14:19.257
Nick, you've got to
take care of yourself.

194
00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:22.359
You don't want the headaches
to get any worse.

195
00:14:22.436 --> 00:14:25.371
Please, call me.

196
00:15:17.024 --> 00:15:18.958
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

197
00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:21.654
- Thought you were out sick.
- No.

198
00:15:21.728 --> 00:15:25.459
Bristol's looking for you.
Just a heads up.

199
00:15:25.532 --> 00:15:27.500
Thanks, man.

200
00:15:29.102 --> 00:15:32.037
- You don't pick up your phone?
- Oh, I was in the copy room.

201
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:33.265
I need those spreadsheets.

202
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.501
Yeah, I put 'em on your desk
last night.

203
00:15:35.576 --> 00:15:38.044
I was here until 7:00.

204
00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:40.375
After that.
Did you check your inbox?

205
00:15:40.447 --> 00:15:43.143
Look, I'm telling you
I can't find 'em, so just...

206
00:15:43.217 --> 00:15:45.742
print me up a new report,
spare me the boring fairy tale.

207
00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:47.787
We've got the Rosemont
Equities meeting, one hour.

208
00:15:47.854 --> 00:15:50.015
Wait. What are you
talking about?

209
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:53.125
11:00,
sales presentation...

210
00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:55.718
- I thought that was at 4:00.
- I had to move it, okay?

211
00:15:55.796 --> 00:15:57.923
And you're just
telling me this now?

212
00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:00.262
Look, Nick,

213
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:03.929
80% of all start-ups fail in the first
two years. It is an uphill battle.

214
00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:07.405
Everyone's got to pull
their own weight. No exceptions.

215
00:16:07.474 --> 00:16:11.410
Okay. No problem.
I'll have the spreadsheets.

216
00:16:11.478 --> 00:16:14.106
I can give the pitch myself if you think
you can't handle it.

217
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.876
I said no problem.

218
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.380
Okay.

219
00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:21.421
You keep
your shit together.

220
00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:23.956
Okay? I can't have you pop another
brain fart and fuck this thing up.

221
00:16:25.392 --> 00:16:27.860
Clean up your desk.
It's a mess.

222
00:16:29.663 --> 00:16:32.427
What we're talking about is software
that will enable your handheld

223
00:16:32.499 --> 00:16:35.627
to communicate with
any wireless technology.

224
00:16:35.702 --> 00:16:40.139
Imagine being able to access
all of your technology from here.

225
00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:43.074
Picture it. Say you're in a cab
on your way to a meeting.

226
00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:46.670
You're checking your e-mails,
you're surfing the web, a call comes in.

227
00:16:46.747 --> 00:16:50.308
Well, your new client decides
that they need additional product images

228
00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:53.751
to be included in the presentation
that you're giving in an hour.

229
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.220
You rush over
to the job site

230
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.817
snap a couple of jpegs,
get to your meeting.

231
00:17:00.927 --> 00:17:03.555
And gentlemen,
what you've got

232
00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:07.691
is a slideshow
in your pocket.

233
00:17:15.575 --> 00:17:18.408
Okay, so...

234
00:17:18.478 --> 00:17:21.413
everyone's developing
next-gen software for handhelds,

235
00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:24.416
including the big guys.

236
00:17:24.484 --> 00:17:26.975
Why put money into yours?

237
00:17:27.054 --> 00:17:28.988
Because ours
is ready now.

238
00:17:29.056 --> 00:17:31.115
We, with our partners
at Strike Line, believe

239
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:33.716
we can have this on the market
within the quarter.

240
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.408
- Nick.
- Is he having a seizure or what?

241
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.917
No, he gets headaches.
Nick! Nick!

242
00:18:09.863 --> 00:18:11.888
I'm so sorry.

243
00:18:14.735 --> 00:18:16.794
I swear, if I get
one more S.E.C. notice,

244
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.271
I'm gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

245
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.366
Yeah, the weather's
nice there.

246
00:18:23.443 --> 00:18:25.934
I'm... sorry about
the meeting, sir.

247
00:18:26.012 --> 00:18:29.243
Nick, I shouldn't
have to tell you...

248
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:32.342
80% of all start-ups fail
within the first two years.

249
00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:34.546
We make one mistake,
it affects everything.

250
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:36.282
We can't go back
and do this over again.

251
00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:39.052
You're absolutely
right.

252
00:18:39.126 --> 00:18:42.391
I assure you this will
not happen again.

253
00:18:42.462 --> 00:18:45.590
Dave tells me you've been
having some problems lately

254
00:18:45.665 --> 00:18:47.599
with concentrating
and remembering stuff.

255
00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:50.192
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

256
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.397
Really, it's...
it's not a big deal.

257
00:18:52.472 --> 00:18:53.996
I want you to just go home,

258
00:18:54.074 --> 00:18:56.599
take the rest of the week off
and recharge the batteries.

259
00:18:56.676 --> 00:18:59.474
- Mr. Callahan, really, I can work.
- Nick...

260
00:18:59.546 --> 00:19:01.673
I need to work.

261
00:19:01.748 --> 00:19:05.184
It's done.
Just go home.

262
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.318
We'll see you in a week.

263
00:19:22.302 --> 00:19:25.135
Always searching

264
00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:29.869
Looking for the one
to wrap your soul

265
00:19:29.943 --> 00:19:31.968
Around

266
00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:38.784
Sing the one name
as you let go

267
00:19:38.852 --> 00:19:41.480
The fear of flying

268
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:44.490
You're on your way

269
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:48.187
Endless love

270
00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:00.430
And you say

271
00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:08.712
You're gonna turn
time around...

272
00:20:16.623 --> 00:20:18.784
Oh, man.

273
00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:51.152
Oh, shit. Baby, did you
grab my sunglasses?

274
00:20:51.224 --> 00:20:54.284
Mm? What would you
do without me?

275
00:20:59.232 --> 00:21:01.200
Hmm?

276
00:21:06.306 --> 00:21:09.469
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

277
00:21:09.543 --> 00:21:11.477
Yeah, a dick
who'll get promoted

278
00:21:11.545 --> 00:21:14.309
instead of me if I flake
on this meeting.

279
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:17.873
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays?
- And Julie's birthday.

280
00:21:20.086 --> 00:21:22.486
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
should just blow the whole thing off.

281
00:21:22.556 --> 00:21:26.492
You're right.
I don't really need this job anyway.

282
00:21:27.694 --> 00:21:29.628
Yeah.
Great idea.

283
00:21:29.696 --> 00:21:31.596
I'm sure when you get fired,
Trevor will last

284
00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:33.758
- two weeks at work without you, maybe.
- "Two weeks at work without you."

285
00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:37.132
- Why you got to say that?
- What?

286
00:21:37.203 --> 00:21:39.763
Ooh, guys, wait.
I want to get a picture of this.

287
00:21:45.745 --> 00:21:48.839
Nice. And you
know what, honey?

288
00:21:48.915 --> 00:21:51.850
You can move to New York with me
and we can be starving artists together.

289
00:21:51.918 --> 00:21:54.352
- Isn't that a perfect idea?
- Put your seat belt on.

290
00:21:54.421 --> 00:21:56.855
- What?
- Put it on!

291
00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:00.788
Okay. Shit.

292
00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.980
I think so.

293
00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:56.366
Hey, pumpkin. Hey, do you know
what you're gonna wear?

294
00:24:06.753 --> 00:24:08.948
What's happening?

295
00:24:09.022 --> 00:24:10.990
Are you okay?

296
00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:18.597
Nick?

297
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.284
Oh, Nick,
are you okay?

298
00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:42.253
What's wrong, huh?
Huh?

299
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:48.089
What's the matter?

300
00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:50.152
I think I was
having a nightmare.

301
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.221
Oh, baby!
It's okay.

302
00:24:52.298 --> 00:24:54.789
All right?
It's all over now. It's all over.

303
00:24:56.636 --> 00:24:58.934
Oh, shh.

304
00:25:05.111 --> 00:25:07.602
Oh, God!

305
00:25:09.015 --> 00:25:11.381
Okay?
Now let's get going.

306
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:13.612
We'll celebrate my birthday.
It'll be fun.

307
00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:17.588
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go get ready. All right.

308
00:25:18.625 --> 00:25:21.185
Okay.

309
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:32.768
I know how weird it sounds.
It's just...

310
00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:35.171
I can't explain it.
I...

311
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:38.301
there's this entire
other version

312
00:25:38.378 --> 00:25:40.369
of my life
without you.

313
00:25:40.446 --> 00:25:44.041
I went through
a whole year

314
00:25:44.117 --> 00:25:46.847
believing you were dead.

315
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.879
And then I just...
I just wake up, and there you are.

316
00:25:50.957 --> 00:25:54.415
Okay, it was just
a bad dream, all right?

317
00:25:54.494 --> 00:25:56.223
It wasn't real.

318
00:25:56.296 --> 00:25:59.265
I'm here.
Come on.

319
00:26:01.968 --> 00:26:04.163
I hear you, I do,

320
00:26:04.237 --> 00:26:07.900
but it's just I'm having
a really difficult time believing it.

321
00:26:07.974 --> 00:26:10.408
It's been
a traumatic year

322
00:26:10.476 --> 00:26:12.774
for both of us, okay?

323
00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:16.475
- But we made it.
- It's not that.

324
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:18.380
Hey.

325
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.715
I am here.

326
00:26:25.091 --> 00:26:27.457
And that's all
that matters.

327
00:26:31.297 --> 00:26:34.164
All right.

328
00:26:34.234 --> 00:26:36.964
- You're right.
- I know.

329
00:26:37.036 --> 00:26:40.369
Oh, fuck.
You're right.

330
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.170
Hi.
Sorry we're late.

331
00:26:43.243 --> 00:26:45.177
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

332
00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:47.907
- Happy 25th, old lady.
- Oh!

333
00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:50.916
How's it going, man?

334
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:52.918
Good.

335
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:55.853
It is really
frickin' good!

336
00:26:55.922 --> 00:26:58.823
Oh, it's good to
see you, man!

337
00:26:58.892 --> 00:27:00.723
Yeah, it's good.
Good.

338
00:27:02.762 --> 00:27:06.289
You two,
you look amazing!

339
00:27:06.366 --> 00:27:08.357
Oh, how much has
he had to drink?

340
00:27:08.434 --> 00:27:11.460
Well, it's been
a long night.

341
00:27:11.537 --> 00:27:14.563
Speaking of which,
why don't, uh...

342
00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:16.871
- Yes, let's.
...you and I do the...

343
00:27:16.943 --> 00:27:18.877
- Right.
- Okay.

344
00:27:18.945 --> 00:27:22.312
...and you two...
good. All right.

345
00:27:22.382 --> 00:27:24.748
Hey, how's it goin', man?
Two MGDs,

346
00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:27.411
Jack on the rocks
and a house red, please.

347
00:27:27.487 --> 00:27:29.978
Please tell me that you
locked down the strippers.

348
00:27:31.424 --> 00:27:33.358
The strippers?

349
00:27:33.426 --> 00:27:36.190
For my bachelor party.

350
00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:38.856
Your bachelor party?

351
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.228
Because... you two
are getting married,

352
00:27:44.304 --> 00:27:46.864
and I'm...
the best man.

353
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.932
Which means I would have
locked down the strippers.

354
00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:52.807
Of course I did,
dumb-ass!

355
00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:54.813
- You're scaring me, man.
- Dude, I got the...

356
00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:57.645
10 hottest
strippers ever.

357
00:27:58.818 --> 00:28:01.218
10?

358
00:28:01.287 --> 00:28:04.017
Awesome! Thanks.
Thank you.

359
00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.081
I am...

360
00:28:07.727 --> 00:28:10.924
I am so psyched
for you guys!

361
00:28:10.997 --> 00:28:12.988
Oh. Okay.

362
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.113
Do you still think
you're dreaming?

363
00:29:04.183 --> 00:29:08.313
Baby, what's wrong?
Baby, what's wrong?

364
00:29:08.388 --> 00:29:10.879
Nothing.

365
00:29:43.489 --> 00:29:46.083
- I love you.
- I love you.

366
00:29:52.498 --> 00:29:54.989
- Oh god.
- All right, baby.

367
00:30:44.684 --> 00:30:47.448
"Migraines have been linked
to seizures in recent studies.

368
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.784
Patients with a high frequency
of migraine attacks

369
00:30:49.856 --> 00:30:52.518
are at greater risk
for cerebral strokes.

370
00:30:52.592 --> 00:30:54.890
This progressive brain disease
can lead to

00:30:54.961 --> 00:30:58.761
acute and selected
memory loss.

372
00:30:58.831 --> 00:31:01.425

00:31:01.501 --> 00:31:04.732
delusions, hallucinations, hearing
things that are not actually present..."

00:31:10.376 --> 00:31:14.073
"Schizophrenia refers to
a split between emotion and thought."

375
00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:34.791
"Studies have shown the disease

376
00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:38.064
which in its end stages
can result in suicide."

377
00:32:02.328 --> 00:32:05.126
Hey!
How ya feelin'?

378
00:32:05.198 --> 00:32:07.996
Oh, busted.
Looking at porn. Again.

379
00:32:08.067 --> 00:32:09.364
- Yeah.
- By the way,

380
00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:11.062
you were really
fucked up last night, man.

381
00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:13.264
Yeah, I had
a couple of drinks.

382
00:32:13.339 --> 00:32:15.705
- Yeah, a couple.
- Um...

383
00:32:18.077 --> 00:32:20.978
What?

384
00:32:21.047 --> 00:32:24.312
Hey, guys. Bristol just called
a staff meeting.

385
00:32:24.383 --> 00:32:26.044
Conference room, five minutes.

386
00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:27.745
Oh, God. What does
that prick want now?

387
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.653
I don't know, but he wants to see you
in his office beforehand.

388
00:32:30.723 --> 00:32:34.284
What?
Oh. Oh, guys?

389
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.352
I think I can already
feel his foot up my ass.

390
00:32:38.664 --> 00:32:41.258
All right, people,
let's get right to it.

391
00:32:43.369 --> 00:32:44.893
You've all heard me warn you
about the problems

392
00:32:44.971 --> 00:32:47.064
of the average start-up company.

393
00:32:47.139 --> 00:32:50.506
Well, it seems that we've been on
the losing end this week.

394
00:32:50.576 --> 00:32:52.840
I had five deals
fall through,

395
00:32:52.912 --> 00:32:55.403
including R.S.B.
Financial.

396
00:32:55.481 --> 00:32:57.472
That's...

397
00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.178
That's Trevor's account.
He said it was a sure thing.

398
00:33:00.253 --> 00:33:02.278
Well,
he was wrong.

399
00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.186
And unfortunately,
Mr. Callahan felt

400
00:33:04.257 --> 00:33:06.521
like he had to send
a message on this one.

401
00:33:06.592 --> 00:33:08.685
We've had to let
Trevor go.

402
00:33:11.731 --> 00:33:14.063
So I suggest that we all
get back to work, hmm?

403
00:33:15.868 --> 00:33:18.894
Doesn't that seem
a little harsh?

404
00:33:22.475 --> 00:33:24.466
Yes.

405
00:33:24.543 --> 00:33:27.137
- So what actually happened?
- Excuse me?

406
00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:29.408
Well, if Trevor thought

407
00:33:29.482 --> 00:33:31.814
it was a sure thing,
why'd the deal fall apart?

408
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.715
Come on, Bristol.

409
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:39.155
You had Trevor's job once,

410
00:33:39.225 --> 00:33:41.420
and you know
how hard it is.

411
00:33:41.494 --> 00:33:44.327
Yeah, and I worked my ass off,
I didn't make mistakes

412
00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:46.558
and I got rewarded.

413
00:33:46.632 --> 00:33:48.964
Why? 'Cause
the Strike Line deal

414
00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:51.435
fell on your lap?

415
00:33:51.504 --> 00:33:55.065
You were supposed to close
the R.S.B. deal, not Trevor.

416
00:33:56.542 --> 00:33:58.942
And you think you know
something we don't?

417
00:33:59.011 --> 00:34:01.741
What I know

418
00:34:01.814 --> 00:34:04.146
is Mr. Callahan pays me
to be the judge of you people,

419
00:34:04.216 --> 00:34:06.480
and right now my judgment is telling me
that you'd much rather be

420
00:34:06.552 --> 00:34:08.679
at home watching "Oprah"
with your friend

421
00:34:08.754 --> 00:34:10.585
than working
on this team any longer.

422
00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:12.783
Congratulations, Nick.
You're fired too.

423
00:34:13.893 --> 00:34:15.884
Anyone else?

424
00:34:22.568 --> 00:34:25.401
I love you, man,
but this was not your problem.

425
00:34:25.471 --> 00:34:27.666
Fuck that.

426
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.607
If it wasn't for us, Bristol wouldn't
have been promoted in the first place.

427
00:34:30.676 --> 00:34:32.701
I'm not taking
orders from him.

428
00:34:32.778 --> 00:34:34.211
Nick, you worked your ass
off at this place.

429
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.747
You put your blood
into this place, man.

430
00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:38.283
Yeah, I put my blood into this place,
and Bristol's the one who gets promoted.

431
00:34:38.351 --> 00:34:41.411
Nick, that's business.
You taught me that.

432
00:34:41.487 --> 00:34:44.547
Now, look.
Go tell Bristol you're sorry.

433
00:34:44.623 --> 00:34:47.023
Tell him you're still having
side effects from the accident.

434
00:34:50.196 --> 00:34:53.996
Only side effect I'm having is knowing
life is way too short for this.

435
00:34:56.736 --> 00:34:58.670
What is this,
a guy thing?

436
00:34:58.738 --> 00:35:01.036
Trevor gets canned, so you just jump off
the bridge with him?

437
00:35:01.107 --> 00:35:03.940
Look, I was never gonna move up with
Bristol as my supervisor anyway.

438
00:35:04.009 --> 00:35:05.738
Ever since the guy got promoted,

439
00:35:05.811 --> 00:35:07.938
he's just been looking
for an excuse to fire me.

440
00:35:08.013 --> 00:35:10.607
- Well, you didn't have to give him one.
- You know what? The truth is,

441
00:35:10.683 --> 00:35:12.776
he's the weak link.
He's ruined the whole company,

442
00:35:12.852 --> 00:35:14.911
and everybody knows it.
And you know what?

443
00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:17.455
I am better off
just getting out from under him.

444
00:35:17.523 --> 00:35:19.889
No, Nick.
You're better off with a job.

445
00:35:19.959 --> 00:35:21.984
I told you,
I'll find another one.

446
00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:24.791
A better one.
We'll all be okay.

447
00:35:24.864 --> 00:35:29.130
You also told me to stay here and not go
to New York, because that would be okay.

448
00:35:29.201 --> 00:35:31.135
I'm sorry,

449
00:35:31.203 --> 00:35:34.502
and I just can't
forget what we lost in that accident.

450
00:35:46.385 --> 00:35:48.353
Hon?

451
00:35:52.224 --> 00:35:54.192
Hey.

452
00:35:55.428 --> 00:35:58.727
Hey, it will be.

453
00:35:58.798 --> 00:36:00.993
It just takes time.

454
00:36:01.066 --> 00:36:04.001
Nick, it's been a year.

455
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:08.335
I spend my days cataloguing other
people's photo shoots for minimum wage.

456
00:36:08.407 --> 00:36:11.808
I have half a portfolio
and no time to finish it, and now...

457
00:36:11.877 --> 00:36:14.607
Well, now I have to get
another job so that we can pay our rent.

458
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.648
Excuse me.

459
00:36:23.189 --> 00:36:25.987
Hey. Hey.

460
00:36:26.058 --> 00:36:28.618
Hey.

461
00:36:28.694 --> 00:36:31.959
It's about the big picture.
I finally see it now.

462
00:36:32.031 --> 00:36:35.660
All that other stuff
is just... just stuff.

463
00:36:35.734 --> 00:36:38.032
Look, the only thing
that is important

464
00:36:38.103 --> 00:36:41.095
is that we have
each other.

465
00:36:41.173 --> 00:36:43.733
That's all that counts.

466
00:36:46.979 --> 00:36:49.243
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

467
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.718
Mm. Maybe I'll be
a technical copyeditor.

468
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.704
Is that Bristol?
Jerk.

469
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.166
Come on.

470
00:37:50.743 --> 00:37:52.711
Nick?

471
00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:56.114
Nick.

472
00:38:04.023 --> 00:38:06.218
- Perfect shot.
- Ah! Great.

473
00:38:06.292 --> 00:38:07.850
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

474
00:38:07.927 --> 00:38:09.554
- Isn't that great?
- You look so good.

475
00:38:09.628 --> 00:38:13.223
Nice.
So, what do you think?

476
00:38:13.299 --> 00:38:15.597
- Hmm?
- The ring, honey. Isn't it beautiful?

477
00:38:15.668 --> 00:38:18.296
Can you believe
I picked that thing out myself?

478
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.463
- It's fantastic.
- Ooh.

479
00:38:20.539 --> 00:38:22.598
Yeah.
Sure, it's beautiful.

480
00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:25.166
We're thinking
next October.

481
00:38:25.244 --> 00:38:28.008
Oh, how many people
are you gonna invite?

482
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.641
You know, maybe 50.
Just the important ones.

483
00:38:31.717 --> 00:38:33.480
- Mmm.
- Ah. Right.

484
00:38:33.552 --> 00:38:36.385
- Dave Bristol.
- What?

485
00:38:36.455 --> 00:38:38.446
From your office?

486
00:38:38.524 --> 00:38:42.187
Yeah, right. Like I'd
invite that tool.

487
00:38:42.261 --> 00:38:45.492
Looks like I'm out.
Anyone else need more?

488
00:38:45.564 --> 00:38:47.725
Oh, no, honey.

489
00:38:51.804 --> 00:38:54.068
Bristol,
merry Christmas.

490
00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:56.437
Merry Christmas.

491
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:10.951
Oh, come on, Nick!

492
00:39:11.023 --> 00:39:13.856
- What are you doing?
- Bristol, I'm sorry, man.

493
00:39:13.926 --> 00:39:16.292
What a klutz.
Can I...

494
00:39:16.362 --> 00:39:18.796
Nice.
That's really nice.

495
00:39:18.864 --> 00:39:20.456
Oh, man.

496
00:39:20.532 --> 00:39:22.159
Oh, that's embarrassing,

497
00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:23.633
so embarrassing.

498
00:40:56.895 --> 00:40:58.863
No way.

499
00:42:20.045 --> 00:42:22.206
Hey, Nick.

500
00:42:22.281 --> 00:42:24.272
I know you need
those spreadsheets.

501
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:26.544
I'm just waiting on some numbers
from the clients.

502
00:42:30.088 --> 00:42:32.488
Holy shit.

503
00:42:32.558 --> 00:42:35.083
I'm the vice president.

504
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.994
Uh, yeah, of course.
I'm not trying to make excuses.

505
00:42:39.064 --> 00:42:41.396
I pulled the Strike Line
deal, not you.

506
00:42:41.466 --> 00:42:44.026
I'm sorry.
I'm just not following this.

507
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.404
Where's Trevor?

508
00:42:47.472 --> 00:42:51.408
At some off-site client meeting.
He said you knew about it.

509
00:42:51.476 --> 00:42:55.003
Oh, yeah, right.
Thanks.

510
00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.380
Oh, and Bristol, clean up that desk.
It's a mess.

511
00:43:06.825 --> 00:43:08.884
I swear, if I get
one more S.E.C. notice,

512
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:12.863
I am gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

513
00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:14.865
Well, I hear
the weather's nice there.

514
00:43:14.933 --> 00:43:18.664
Yeah, I guess.
So how you feelin'?

515
00:43:18.737 --> 00:43:22.195
Oh, better than ever.

516
00:43:22.274 --> 00:43:24.538
Listen, I'm having dinner
with a potential investor.

517
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:26.601
He's a big one.
We need him.

518
00:43:26.678 --> 00:43:28.646
You know what they say
about start-ups.

519
00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:31.749
I want you riding shotgun.

520
00:43:31.817 --> 00:43:34.411
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, Mr. Callahan.

521
00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:37.649
"Mr. Callahan."
That's cute.

522
00:44:15.193 --> 00:44:18.219
The weather burns in you

523
00:44:18.297 --> 00:44:21.528
I can't predict the rain

524
00:44:23.835 --> 00:44:25.826
The silence falls...

525
00:44:25.904 --> 00:44:27.997
"Pacific Avenue."

526
00:44:28.073 --> 00:44:30.769
You've reached Julie Miller
Photography.

527
00:44:30.842 --> 00:44:33.072
I can't take your call,
so please leave a message,

528
00:44:33.145 --> 00:44:35.978
including your phone number
and the date you'd like to book.

529
00:44:36.048 --> 00:44:37.982
Thank you.

530
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.019
Well, hello there,
Julie Miller Photography.

531
00:44:41.086 --> 00:44:43.384
It's Nick Larson calling,

532
00:44:43.455 --> 00:44:47.414
and the date I would like to book is for
tonight after my client meeting,

533
00:44:47.492 --> 00:44:49.551
which hopefully won't
last too long.

534
00:44:49.628 --> 00:44:51.425
So why don't you
give me a call back

535
00:44:51.496 --> 00:44:53.760
and let me know if that works
for your schedule?

536
00:44:53.832 --> 00:44:57.324
Unless of course I see you at home
first. All right. I love you, babe.

537
00:45:05.711 --> 00:45:07.679
Honey, I'm home!

538
00:45:12.351 --> 00:45:14.285
No.

539
00:45:23.929 --> 00:45:25.897
What?

540
00:45:40.445 --> 00:45:43.141
Hey, Nick, it's Mom.
I hope you're okay.

541
00:45:43.215 --> 00:45:45.445
I'd say so.

542
00:45:45.517 --> 00:45:48.577
Call me. I haven't seen you for weeks.
I know you're busy,

543
00:45:48.653 --> 00:45:51.281
but let me know
how you are.

544
00:46:07.339 --> 00:46:10.536
A toast... to
successful partnerships.

545
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:12.543
- Salud.
- Salud.

546
00:46:12.611 --> 00:46:15.637
Your daughter is
charming and beautiful.

547
00:46:17.082 --> 00:46:19.550
Thank you.

548
00:46:19.618 --> 00:46:22.712
Mm. And what
about you, Nick?

549
00:46:22.788 --> 00:46:25.154
Do you have
family here?

550
00:46:25.223 --> 00:46:27.384
Uh, just my mom.
Yeah.

551
00:46:27.459 --> 00:46:30.485
My, uh... my father moved away
when I was a kid.

552
00:46:30.562 --> 00:46:32.928
Ah. I am very sorry
to hear that.

553
00:46:34.699 --> 00:46:36.826
Well, it seems that
you turned out all right.

554
00:46:36.902 --> 00:46:39.427
You have certainly made
an impression on your boss.

555
00:46:39.504 --> 00:46:41.028
Oh, well...

556
00:46:41.106 --> 00:46:43.267
Nick's had a bit of
a magic touch lately.

557
00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:47.107
Well, I just try to keep
things simple, you know?

558
00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:49.647
Know what you want
and try to make that happen.

559
00:46:49.714 --> 00:46:52.239
And if that doesn't work out,
you steal the file

560
00:46:52.317 --> 00:46:54.615
from the guy sitting next to you
and hope that one's a winner.

561
00:46:56.254 --> 00:46:59.815
All right, Nick.
Well, let's get serious for a minute

562
00:46:59.891 --> 00:47:03.588
and tell Mr. Fuentes
about the new numbers.

563
00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.299
Now? Oh, we're having
such a good time.

564
00:47:08.366 --> 00:47:10.960
The new numbers,
Nick.

565
00:47:11.036 --> 00:47:14.301
We're about to ask
Mr. Fuentes for a large amount of money.

566
00:47:14.372 --> 00:47:16.897
You have to dazzle
the wallet out of his pocket

567
00:47:16.975 --> 00:47:19.637
and make it dance
on the table.

568
00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:23.112
No, really, Ron, you take the glory.
This is your baby.

569
00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:26.644
The numbers, Nick.

570
00:47:29.387 --> 00:47:32.550
Well, what we're, uh...
we're really talking about

571
00:47:32.624 --> 00:47:35.058
is, uh...

572
00:47:38.763 --> 00:47:41.857
the next generation of
hand-held operating systems.

573
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.305
Our software capitalizes
on optical internet protocol,

574
00:47:48.373 --> 00:47:50.898
using light-wave
architectures for processing

575
00:47:50.976 --> 00:47:53.877
so that it will send and receive data
over multiple wavelengths.

576
00:47:53.945 --> 00:47:56.106
Our system can be commercialized
within six months,

577
00:47:56.181 --> 00:47:58.741
and with a working beta product
and your company's backing,

578
00:47:58.817 --> 00:48:02.344
we can expect to sign one,
maybe two of the incumbents.

579
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.752
Then we'll minimize
our front-end expenditures

580
00:48:04.823 --> 00:48:06.757
by outsourcing to
a flex manufacturer in China.

581
00:48:06.825 --> 00:48:08.986
If we're right,
our product margins will add

582
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.655
500 basis points to your company's
gross margins within 12 months.

583
00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:16.497
Bottom line, if we achieve one-third
of the unit sales forecasted,

584
00:48:16.568 --> 00:48:18.536
we'll double your
company's cash flow.

585
00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:39.757
All right.

586
00:48:43.228 --> 00:48:45.560
Hey.
How's it going?

587
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.996
I'm about to pull out
my hair, I'm so bored.

588
00:48:49.367 --> 00:48:52.359
Yeah, it's, uh...

589
00:48:52.437 --> 00:48:54.769
sorry for all
the technobabble.

590
00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:58.605
Actually, you know,
that's the part that got me hot.

591
00:48:58.677 --> 00:48:59.837
Grace?

592
00:49:00.946 --> 00:49:02.379
Oh Jesus.

593
00:49:02.447 --> 00:49:04.540
What are you doing?

594
00:49:04.616 --> 00:49:06.743
Baby, it's been
a week.

595
00:49:06.818 --> 00:49:08.979
What, you want me
to beg for it?

596
00:49:11.256 --> 00:49:14.919
Whoa. Hey. Hey hey hey.
We're in a restaurant.

597
00:49:16.094 --> 00:49:18.790
When has that ever
stopped you before?

598
00:49:28.173 --> 00:49:30.437
Oh fuck.

599
00:49:30.508 --> 00:49:32.476
Hold up.
Your dad's right outside.

600
00:49:32.544 --> 00:49:34.478
I don't care about that,
and neither does he.

601
00:49:34.546 --> 00:49:37.310
Besides, I'll just tell him
to give you another raise.

602
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.988
Oh, Nick!

603
00:49:53.565 --> 00:49:56.500
- I want you, Nick.
- I hear you.

604
00:50:06.444 --> 00:50:06.671
Yeah.

605
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.861
Yeah!

606
00:50:50.322 --> 00:50:52.187
Oh my God.
What are you doing?

607
00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:54.521
Let's have some fun here.

608
00:50:54.592 --> 00:50:57.288
Smile, baby.

609
00:50:57.362 --> 00:50:59.830
Uh-uh. Hey...

610
00:50:59.898 --> 00:51:02.332
- I'll be in touch.
- You're most welcome.

611
00:51:05.003 --> 00:51:07.938
You did great, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

612
00:51:08.006 --> 00:51:10.497
Yeah, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

613
00:51:19.084 --> 00:51:23.282
Here I am
to let you know

614
00:51:23.355 --> 00:51:27.121
Take it back
and let it slow

615
00:51:27.192 --> 00:51:30.457
Take it back
and let it slow

616
00:51:33.365 --> 00:51:37.495
Lust away from
all that ends

617
00:51:37.569 --> 00:51:41.005
Try to keep
all amends

618
00:51:41.072 --> 00:51:44.530
Try to keep all amends

619
00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:53.007
Your home

620
00:51:53.084 --> 00:51:55.382
You hardly know it...

621
00:52:11.169 --> 00:52:12.761
- Oh! Jesus!
- Where were you?

622
00:52:12.837 --> 00:52:14.304
I was waiting for two hours.

623
00:52:14.372 --> 00:52:16.602
Trevor, settle down, man.
I was at dinner with Callahan.

624
00:52:16.674 --> 00:52:18.608
What? I told you,
we need to talk.

625
00:52:18.676 --> 00:52:21.474
All right.
What's going on?

626
00:52:21.546 --> 00:52:25.209
I've got a problem with
one of my investors.

627
00:52:25.283 --> 00:52:27.843
- Who?
- Malcolm.

628
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:32.447
- "Malcolm"?
- Are you playing with me?

629
00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:36.290
Malcolm, from the club.
We took his money. You closed the deal.

630
00:52:36.361 --> 00:52:38.522
- Is your head fucked? Come on!
- Malcolm, of course.

631
00:52:38.596 --> 00:52:40.029
Yes. What's up?
What's going on?

632
00:52:40.098 --> 00:52:43.556
The money...
h-he-he... he wants it back.

633
00:52:43.635 --> 00:52:46.263
- All right. How much?
- All of it.

634
00:52:46.337 --> 00:52:48.897
- 250 grand.
- "250 grand"?

635
00:52:52.243 --> 00:52:55.940
- Did he do that to you?
- It was one of his guys, as a reminder.

636
00:52:56.014 --> 00:52:58.244
Just listen.
Listen to me, Nick.

637
00:52:58.316 --> 00:53:00.181
You've got to make
this happen, man, okay?

638
00:53:00.251 --> 00:53:01.912
'Cause I can't mess
around with this guy.

639
00:53:01.986 --> 00:53:03.476
I- I- I can't make him
wait anymore.

640
00:53:03.555 --> 00:53:06.319
Hey, Trevor...

641
00:53:06.391 --> 00:53:08.951
I'll talk to Ron.
I'll take care of it.

642
00:53:09.027 --> 00:53:12.121
It's no big deal.
All right?

643
00:53:12.197 --> 00:53:14.859
- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- All right, okay.

644
00:53:14.933 --> 00:53:18.300
- I owe you my life, man.
- No no. Dude.

645
00:53:19.404 --> 00:53:21.429
- It's all right.
- All right.

646
00:53:23.475 --> 00:53:25.739
Hey.

647
00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.802
You, uh... you talk
to Julie lately?

648
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.610
No. Not in a while.
Why?

649
00:53:31.683 --> 00:53:33.844
I'm having a hard time
tracking her down.

650
00:53:33.918 --> 00:53:35.442
Dude.

651
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.318
You told me last time,
you're done with her, right?

652
00:53:41.292 --> 00:53:43.453
See you later.

653
00:54:24.869 --> 00:54:27.099
Ron.
How's it going, man?

654
00:54:27.171 --> 00:54:30.106
For shit.
Fuentes bailed.

655
00:54:30.174 --> 00:54:32.142
What? You got to
be kidding me.

656
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:34.235
After last night
I thought we had him.

657
00:54:34.312 --> 00:54:36.439
Yeah, well, fuck him.
His mistake.

658
00:54:36.514 --> 00:54:38.846
Oh, Jesus!

659
00:54:41.786 --> 00:54:43.811
Listen, I hate to
pile on, man, but, um,

660
00:54:43.888 --> 00:54:46.550
it seems we have a problem
with one of our investors.

661
00:54:46.624 --> 00:54:48.819
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:48.893 --> 00:54:51.589
Guy Trevor brought in back
in July, gave us 250 grand?

663
00:54:51.663 --> 00:54:55.292
Anyway, he says, uh...
he says he wants it back.

664
00:54:57.936 --> 00:55:01.099
- That's it?
- Yeah.

665
00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:03.106
That's pocket change.

666
00:55:03.174 --> 00:55:06.143
Why don't you just go get the checkbook
off my desk and write it yourself?

667
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:10.271
Ron, thank you so much, man.
I knew you'd understand.

668
00:55:10.348 --> 00:55:12.839
Why don't you write
a few more while you're at it?

669
00:55:12.917 --> 00:55:15.442
I mean, just go down to the corner
and pass 'em out with milk and cookies.

670
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.283
I mean, if you really
want to give some money away.

671
00:55:17.355 --> 00:55:19.949
It's not like that, man.

672
00:55:20.024 --> 00:55:22.515
Nick,
we have contracts

673
00:55:22.594 --> 00:55:24.653
that specify how and when
people get paid back.

674
00:55:24.729 --> 00:55:28.165
I know. I understand.
Look, it is a one-time thing.

675
00:55:28.232 --> 00:55:30.427
I'll make it up to you
on the next deal.

676
00:55:32.937 --> 00:55:36.236
I don't get it. Were you asleep for our
entire conversation yesterday?

677
00:55:38.543 --> 00:55:40.534
Which... which one?

678
00:55:40.612 --> 00:55:42.978
The one where
I told you we're broke.

679
00:55:44.916 --> 00:55:48.408
- What?
- Nick, the money is gone.

680
00:55:48.486 --> 00:55:50.716
No matter how many times
we go over it, it is gone.

681
00:55:50.788 --> 00:55:53.780
We've spent it...
everything we had and more.

682
00:55:55.426 --> 00:55:58.486
- Ron, that's not possible.
- You wouldn't think so,

683
00:55:58.563 --> 00:56:01.088
but somehow we managed
to pull it off.

684
00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:05.703
What about
the Strike Line deal?

685
00:56:09.974 --> 00:56:12.943
Nick, you're
a good salesman.

686
00:56:13.011 --> 00:56:15.707
You've done a lot of
great things for my company.

687
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.214
I'm glad I made you V.P.,

688
00:56:18.282 --> 00:56:21.308
but let's face it...
you blew it on that one.

689
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.581
What are you
talking about?

690
00:56:28.826 --> 00:56:30.851
You approached them
during Christmas.

691
00:56:30.928 --> 00:56:32.862
We weren't ready.

692
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:35.626
No matter how you look at it, Nick, you
scared them off. That's the truth.

693
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.395
I didn't make
the Strike Line deal.

694
00:56:41.472 --> 00:56:44.168
Hell, you know,
if... if we had just nailed that deal,

695
00:56:44.242 --> 00:56:46.870
we'd actually probably have some
working software right now

696
00:56:46.944 --> 00:56:49.344
instead of this
pile of garbage.

697
00:56:56.954 --> 00:56:59.684
Hey.

698
00:56:59.757 --> 00:57:02.851
- So what's the story?
- Still working on it.

699
00:57:02.927 --> 00:57:06.920
Nick, come on, man.
I'm meeting Malcolm tonight.

700
00:57:06.998 --> 00:57:10.490
Hey. I'm gonna
take care of it.

701
00:57:13.504 --> 00:57:16.029
Okay.

702
00:57:21.345 --> 00:57:24.109
Julie.
Hey, it's, uh...

703
00:57:24.182 --> 00:57:26.343
it's me, Nick, again.

704
00:57:26.417 --> 00:57:28.510
Um...

705
00:57:28.586 --> 00:57:32.113
listen, I know that
there's some stuff between us,

706
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:35.421
and you're obviously
not calling me back, but...

707
00:57:35.493 --> 00:57:38.462
I'd really like
to talk to you.

708
00:57:38.529 --> 00:57:41.327
Happy belated birthday,
and, uh...

709
00:57:42.934 --> 00:57:44.902
I miss you.

710
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:08.454
- Hello?
- Nick. Finally.

711
00:58:08.526 --> 00:58:10.687
- Oh, hey, Mom.
- How are you?

712
00:58:10.762 --> 00:58:13.492
Fine, uh, what's up?

713
00:58:13.564 --> 00:58:17.091
I've spoken to your father's doctor.
He'd like to see you.

714
00:58:17.168 --> 00:58:19.261
Will you talk to him?

715
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:22.771
Why? What...
what do you mean?

716
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.537
I'm concerned about you.
I really want to come and see you.

717
00:58:26.611 --> 00:58:29.978
- No no, I'm good, Mom. I'm fine.
- No, I really...

718
00:58:30.047 --> 00:58:31.708
Hey, listen, I got to go, okay?
I'll call you later.

719
00:58:31.783 --> 00:58:33.717
- Nick...
- I love you.

720
00:58:33.785 --> 00:58:35.753
Bye.

721
00:58:50.268 --> 00:58:53.203
Let me see.
Oh, looks good, huh?

722
01:00:11.215 --> 01:00:13.183
Julie.

723
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.288
Hey.

724
01:00:18.356 --> 01:00:20.415
Wow, I...

725
01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:22.686
hardly recognized you,
you look so different.

726
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.160
Uh, thanks,
I think.

727
01:00:25.229 --> 01:00:27.993
No, I mean,
you look beautiful.

728
01:00:30.268 --> 01:00:32.736
Um, I left you a bunch of messages.
Did you get 'em?

729
01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:35.328
Yeah, I got 'em.

730
01:00:35.406 --> 01:00:37.397
Okay.

731
01:00:37.475 --> 01:00:39.466
I'm sorry.
I know I...

732
01:00:39.543 --> 01:00:43.001
I got a little carried away.
I just really wanted to talk to you.

733
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.743
Well, I'm standing here,
so go ahead.

734
01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:50.947
Um...
What are you doing?

735
01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:54.287
- I'm working.
- At a club?

736
01:00:54.358 --> 01:00:57.418
Yeah, at a club.
I'm shooting a fashion show.

737
01:00:57.495 --> 01:01:01.363
Well, that's cool.
Who hooked that up?

738
01:01:01.432 --> 01:01:05.425
Christopher. He introduced
me to a few people and it just took off.

739
01:01:05.503 --> 01:01:07.437
Wow.
Who's Christopher?

740
01:01:07.505 --> 01:01:09.200
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

741
01:01:09.273 --> 01:01:11.332
- You call me?
- I did.

742
01:01:11.409 --> 01:01:14.071
- And who's this?
- Oh, uh, Nick.

743
01:01:14.145 --> 01:01:16.306
Old friend.
We're just catching up.

744
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:20.077
Nick, she's the greatest, isn't she?
She's gonna be a star, aren't you, baby?

745
01:01:20.151 --> 01:01:22.085
Listen, I'm gonna
get another drink.

746
01:01:22.153 --> 01:01:23.586
- Can I get you something?
- Sure.

747
01:01:23.654 --> 01:01:25.781
- Nick?
- No, I'm good.

748
01:01:25.856 --> 01:01:27.346
All right

749
01:01:33.164 --> 01:01:35.098
Julie.
Julie.

750
01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:37.532
Listen,

751
01:01:37.601 --> 01:01:39.728
I know some stuff
went wrong with us,

752
01:01:39.804 --> 01:01:43.740
but you have to believe me, I never
meant for it to end up like this.

753
01:01:43.808 --> 01:01:45.799
Oh, cut the shit, Nick.
You know what?

754
01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:47.707
You got everything exactly
the way you wanted it,

755
01:01:47.778 --> 01:01:49.336
so don't start caring
about me now.

756
01:01:49.413 --> 01:01:51.904
I am telling you,
whatever I said,

757
01:01:51.983 --> 01:01:54.076
whatever I did, whatever...
happened between us,

758
01:01:54.151 --> 01:01:56.415
just... just wipe it
out of your head.

759
01:01:56.487 --> 01:02:00.014
Don't you get it?
I already have.

760
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:03.424
You know, and all your talk
about your job

761
01:02:03.494 --> 01:02:05.724
and my career,
the future,

762
01:02:05.796 --> 01:02:08.822
that's all it was,
Nick... talk.

763
01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:10.696
And now
I'm my own boss,

764
01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:14.226
and for the first time
I'm doing exactly what I want to do.

765
01:02:14.305 --> 01:02:16.398
No, you're not.

766
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:20.504
I know what you want,
and it's not this.

767
01:02:21.712 --> 01:02:23.873
- Things change.
- Not us.

768
01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:27.475
Julie, we can
start over.

769
01:02:28.853 --> 01:02:30.411
Just give me a chance.

770
01:02:35.292 --> 01:02:38.455
- That's her, isn't it?
- Who?

771
01:02:41.032 --> 01:02:43.000
Grace.

772
01:02:44.735 --> 01:02:47.226
Julie, no.

773
01:02:47.304 --> 01:02:50.171
You are the only thing
in this world that matters to me.

774
01:02:50.241 --> 01:02:53.108
I don't know how
I lost sight of that.

775
01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:55.304
I can fix this.

776
01:02:55.379 --> 01:02:57.745
I promise you I will.

777
01:02:58.849 --> 01:03:01.249
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

778
01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:07.257
Hey...

779
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.259
Nick.
Oh, thank God.

780
01:03:18.335 --> 01:03:20.269
See, I told you
he'd show.

781
01:03:20.337 --> 01:03:21.804
I'm really glad
you could make it, Nick.

782
01:03:21.872 --> 01:03:23.533
- Malcolm, I assume.
- Yeah,

783
01:03:23.607 --> 01:03:26.599
- good to meet you face to face finally.
- And you.

784
01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:29.237
This is Wayne.
He owns half the club with me.

785
01:03:29.313 --> 01:03:31.907
Wayne?
Nick.

786
01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:33.973
Good luck.

787
01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:38.955
Have a seat.

788
01:03:45.663 --> 01:03:47.631
All right.

789
01:03:50.101 --> 01:03:53.434
Malcolm, this space
is fantastic.

790
01:03:53.504 --> 01:03:55.870
Thank you very much.

791
01:04:00.311 --> 01:04:03.712
Here we go.
A little black tea

792
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:06.306
with ginseng
and mango.

793
01:04:06.383 --> 01:04:08.510
We call it
Chinese rocket fuel.

794
01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:10.520
Keeps you sharp,
mind and body.

795
01:04:10.588 --> 01:04:12.556
It seems to be
working for you.

796
01:04:14.492 --> 01:04:16.426
I know why
you're here.

797
01:04:16.494 --> 01:04:19.122
You want to renegotiate
your contract.

798
01:04:20.164 --> 01:04:21.893
Yes.

799
01:04:21.966 --> 01:04:24.366
Your friend made
a lot of promises.

800
01:04:24.435 --> 01:04:27.131
Said he could get me in on the ground
floor, triple my money with some sort of

801
01:04:27.204 --> 01:04:29.900
turbocharged
super-phone software,

802
01:04:29.974 --> 01:04:32.568
and I'm no expert,
but it sounded pretty good.

803
01:04:32.643 --> 01:04:34.873
And it is, Malcolm.

804
01:04:34.945 --> 01:04:36.879
That's all true.

805
01:04:36.947 --> 01:04:40.383
It is an excellent product. I'm sure
your investment will see a great return.

806
01:04:40.451 --> 01:04:43.579
Malcolm, I'm not sure what
it is you're looking for,

807
01:04:43.654 --> 01:04:46.487
but if you look at your contract, you'll
see we're well within our timeline.

808
01:04:48.025 --> 01:04:50.152
Okay,
but at some time,

809
01:04:50.227 --> 01:04:53.424
I need to feel like there's some sort
of progress going on.

810
01:04:53.497 --> 01:04:57.331
Okay. Well, how can I
help you feel like that?

811
01:04:59.136 --> 01:05:01.104
See, we're part
of an organization.

812
01:05:01.172 --> 01:05:03.902
There's a chain of command.
It's the way things are done.

813
01:05:03.974 --> 01:05:06.306
Which is why we sign
contracts that specify

814
01:05:06.377 --> 01:05:08.504
how and when people
are paid back.

815
01:05:08.579 --> 01:05:12.208
You're a businessman.
You know how the whole thing works.

816
01:05:18.656 --> 01:05:20.886
Have you ever wished you could look
into the future?

817
01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:26.058
The Chinese believe it's possible just
by looking at a pattern of tea leaves.

818
01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:29.293
So... the question is,

819
01:05:30.568 --> 01:05:33.002
do I see a waterfall

820
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:35.538
dripping with all the money
you guys are gonna make me?

821
01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.038
Or, uh,

822
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:41.771
do I see a little bonfire
cooking as everything

823
01:05:41.845 --> 01:05:43.836
- I gave you goes up in smoke?
- That's not it, Malcolm.

824
01:05:43.914 --> 01:05:45.575
Well, I'm dying for you
to prove me otherwise.

825
01:05:46.984 --> 01:05:49.111
I think I can help.

826
01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:51.416
Because of your
relationship with Trevor

827
01:05:51.488 --> 01:05:53.422
and my confidence
in this product,

828
01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:56.084
I've written you
a personal check for 10%.

829
01:06:00.097 --> 01:06:03.828
25 thousand
out of 250?

830
01:06:05.869 --> 01:06:08.099
It's a Band-Aid
until your...

831
01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:10.402
your investment
sees its return.

832
01:06:13.944 --> 01:06:16.412
Band-Aids.
I love Band-Aids.

833
01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.710
Now, you see?
I told you,

834
01:06:18.782 --> 01:06:22.878
Nick's on this now,
and he's gonna take care of everything.

835
01:06:29.593 --> 01:06:31.618
Well, it's better
than nothing,

836
01:06:31.695 --> 01:06:33.686
which is all I've gotten
from you so far.

837
01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:38.657
So, maybe it's time we cut out
the middlemen, right?

838
01:06:45.442 --> 01:06:47.342
No!

839
01:06:53.717 --> 01:06:56.550
Get him out.

840
01:07:07.998 --> 01:07:09.989
Nick?

841
01:07:11.068 --> 01:07:14.299
- No!
- What?

842
01:07:14.371 --> 01:07:16.305
Stay in here, okay?

843
01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:18.534
Come on, move, move!
Get out!

844
01:07:18.609 --> 01:07:21.043
Shit!
Get out! Now!

845
01:07:21.111 --> 01:07:23.671
Fuck! Fuck!

846
01:07:23.747 --> 01:07:25.738
Julie?

847
01:07:28.786 --> 01:07:30.720
Julie?

848
01:07:30.788 --> 01:07:32.756
- Nick?
- No!

849
01:07:34.024 --> 01:07:36.117
No, Julie!
Fuck!

850
01:07:36.193 --> 01:07:38.718
- Oh, Julie! Oh, my God!
- What's happening?

851
01:07:38.796 --> 01:07:40.889
Shh. Shh.
I love you, baby.

852
01:07:40.964 --> 01:07:43.398
I love you.
You're okay, okay?

853
01:07:43.467 --> 01:07:45.833
Here. Don't look.
Here here. Hey, look at me.

854
01:07:45.903 --> 01:07:49.202
Look at me, look at me.
Everything's fine. Okay?

855
01:07:49.273 --> 01:07:51.138
You're okay. Shh.

856
01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:53.233
Breathe.

857
01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:57.340
Come on!

858
01:07:57.414 --> 01:07:59.473
Breathe.
Just breathe.

859
01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:01.347
All right.
All right.

860
01:08:37.287 --> 01:08:39.278
Oh, Grace!

861
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:46.959
Oh, God.

862
01:08:49.833 --> 01:08:51.266
Found something that
would wake you up.

863
01:08:51.335 --> 01:08:53.269
What the fuck?

864
01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:56.306
Relax.
You're enjoying it.

865
01:08:57.875 --> 01:09:00.275
Your shit's on the floor.

866
01:09:08.919 --> 01:09:12.013
You want something
to drink?

867
01:09:19.196 --> 01:09:21.289
Who are you?

868
01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:23.458
Huh?

869
01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:26.594
How did I get here?

870
01:09:29.506 --> 01:09:32.634
You are
so bloody cute.

871
01:09:35.612 --> 01:09:38.706
- Answer the question.
- Get your hands off of me.

872
01:09:42.052 --> 01:09:45.453
You don't remember me?
We met at the club.

873
01:09:45.522 --> 01:09:48.116
Malcolm and I
are partners.

874
01:09:48.192 --> 01:09:51.684
On everything.
Which means I own half your ass.

875
01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:01.196
I understand you
owe us $250,000.

876
01:10:02.272 --> 01:10:04.297
If you hadda behaved yourself,

877
01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:07.468
I could've persuaded Malcolm
into reducing your bill,

878
01:10:07.544 --> 01:10:10.843
but now you're not going anywhere
until he gets here.

879
01:10:10.914 --> 01:10:12.848
Don't you get it?

880
01:10:28.899 --> 01:10:32.062
I'm sure your girlfriend
and Trevor would agree.

881
01:10:32.135 --> 01:10:34.069
Fuck you.

882
01:10:41.211 --> 01:10:43.805
I really screwed things up, Mom.

883
01:10:43.881 --> 01:10:47.476
I tried so hard
to fix everything, to just...

884
01:10:47.551 --> 01:10:50.520
make things right, and every time I do
I make it so much worse.

885
01:10:51.889 --> 01:10:54.050
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

886
01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:56.854
Don't. You remind me
of your father when you talk like that.

887
01:10:56.927 --> 01:11:00.055
- Why?
- You try to control everything.

888
01:11:03.901 --> 01:11:06.495
Mom, I want
to talk to Dad.

889
01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:09.164
No, you can...
you can't, okay?

890
01:11:09.239 --> 01:11:11.969
You don't understand.
It's really important.

891
01:11:12.042 --> 01:11:14.636
- No, you don't understand.
- Mom, you've gotta help me find him.

892
01:11:14.711 --> 01:11:16.406
Nick, he's dead.

893
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:21.945
He committed suicide.

894
01:11:24.888 --> 01:11:26.515
Why would you
keep that from me?

895
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.251
I don't know.

896
01:11:28.325 --> 01:11:30.122
I didn't want you
to remember him like that.

897
01:11:30.193 --> 01:11:33.959
The point is, Nick, it's you
I'm worried about.

898
01:11:35.232 --> 01:11:38.497
You can't do this alone.

899
01:11:38.569 --> 01:11:41.367
You need to see a doctor.

900
01:11:41.438 --> 01:11:44.566
You don't have to
have the same fate as your father.

901
01:11:45.742 --> 01:11:48.677
Nick, you can't
control everything.

902
01:11:48.745 --> 01:11:50.906
You have to let it go.

903
01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.627
Another drink, please.

904
01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:11.323
Thanks.

905
01:12:14.171 --> 01:12:17.106
Nick.
What's going on?

906
01:12:17.174 --> 01:12:19.233
Oh my God.

907
01:12:19.309 --> 01:12:21.174
What happened to you?

908
01:12:27.684 --> 01:12:29.709
Did you bring it?

909
01:12:36.493 --> 01:12:38.222
Where is Trevor?

910
01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.892
I can't believe that
was only a year ago.

911
01:12:42.966 --> 01:12:45.161
I know
something's wrong.

912
01:12:45.235 --> 01:12:47.669
First, Trevor comes home
with a black eye.

913
01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:49.968
Then he says you have
some meeting together,

914
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.667
but he doesn't
come home at all.

915
01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:54.074
And now you want me
to bring you some old picture?

916
01:12:57.881 --> 01:13:00.782
Nick, I'm really scared.

917
01:13:00.851 --> 01:13:02.682
I know.

918
01:13:05.122 --> 01:13:08.148
You know that
I'd do anything for Trevor, don't you?

919
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:13.421
I'd do anything
for all you guys.

920
01:13:15.699 --> 01:13:17.633
Yeah.

921
01:13:19.269 --> 01:13:20.793
Come here.

922
01:13:24.474 --> 01:13:26.533
I know you're scared.

923
01:13:33.016 --> 01:13:35.109
I can't explain it...

924
01:13:36.353 --> 01:13:39.151
but I promise you
that Trevor's okay.

925
01:14:34.611 --> 01:14:36.101
Oh, great, guys.

926
01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:38.010
Check it out...

927
01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:41.278
I brought my own special
birthday candle.

928
01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:42.943
- Yes!
- It's drugs!

929
01:14:43.019 --> 01:14:44.850
Oh! My favorite.

930
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:46.946
Light it!

931
01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:53.356
- Light it.
- Yes yes.

932
01:14:55.132 --> 01:14:57.066
Where are you going?

933
01:14:57.134 --> 01:14:59.762
- Somewhere.
- Oh, really?

934
01:14:59.836 --> 01:15:01.861
With you.

935
01:15:01.938 --> 01:15:03.667
Okay.

936
01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.502
I need to talk
to you alone.

937
01:15:07.577 --> 01:15:09.204
Oh.

938
01:15:11.014 --> 01:15:12.948
Put this on,
it might get cold.

939
01:15:13.016 --> 01:15:15.041
Hmm.

940
01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.791
Ah. This looks exactly
the same as it did

941
01:15:22.859 --> 01:15:24.827
when you first
brought me here.

942
01:15:25.929 --> 01:15:28.489
I can't believe...
when was that?

943
01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:31.193
- Three years ago.
- Three years ago.

944
01:15:31.268 --> 01:15:32.792
Wow.

945
01:15:34.371 --> 01:15:36.862
I can't imagine my life
without you now.

946
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:42.410
Nick, I want
to tell you something.

947
01:15:42.479 --> 01:15:44.140
Me first.

948
01:15:44.214 --> 01:15:45.772
Okay.

949
01:15:46.983 --> 01:15:48.678
You need
to go to New York.

950
01:15:50.654 --> 01:15:52.849
- What?
- I know that it sounds strange,

951
01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.118
but trust me,
it's for the best.

952
01:15:55.192 --> 01:15:56.887
Where is this coming from?

953
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.827
This is your chance
to pursue your art,

954
01:15:59.896 --> 01:16:01.887
to... find out
about yourself,

955
01:16:01.965 --> 01:16:04.763
to not have to worry
about me or us or my job

956
01:16:04.835 --> 01:16:06.962
or all that
other bullshit, just...

957
01:16:07.037 --> 01:16:08.971
- I don't want to be free.
- Listen to me.

958
01:16:09.039 --> 01:16:11.872
This is
your last chance to...

959
01:16:14.511 --> 01:16:17.036
pursue your own path
in life,

960
01:16:17.113 --> 01:16:18.808
one that
I can't fuck up.

961
01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:23.313
Well, I don't want to pursue
my own path. That wasn't the deal.

962
01:16:23.386 --> 01:16:24.876
- Listen.
- We were going to do this together

963
01:16:24.955 --> 01:16:27.446
and we were gonna work it out,
and you promised you would be there.

964
01:16:27.524 --> 01:16:30.084
Just trust me, I know, baby.
I don't think you're getting it.

965
01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.718
Julie...

966
01:16:41.371 --> 01:16:44.363
I just need a little
space myself right now.

967
01:16:47.844 --> 01:16:49.812
I'm sorry.

968
01:16:52.883 --> 01:16:54.851
You're breaking up with me?

969
01:16:56.286 --> 01:16:58.880
- That's it?
- Yeah.

970
01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:04.423
I don't think
there's anything left to be said.

971
01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:18.568
Nick, I'm pregnant.

972
01:17:41.531 --> 01:17:43.396
Trevor.

973
01:17:43.466 --> 01:17:45.730
Where's Julie?

974
01:17:45.802 --> 01:17:47.736
- What happened?
- Yeah, dude, she ran down here,

975
01:17:47.804 --> 01:17:49.965
grabbed your keys
and took off to your car.

976
01:18:01.952 --> 01:18:04.819
No! Oh God!

977
01:18:09.793 --> 01:18:12.284
- All right, here we go.
- Keep going to the point and back.

978
01:18:21.771 --> 01:18:24.433
Hey, man, what are you doing?
That's my car!

979
01:18:51.334 --> 01:18:54.235
Slow down.
Please, slow down.

980
01:18:57.507 --> 01:18:59.634
Oh God.

981
01:19:03.213 --> 01:19:05.408
- Oh, you've got to be kidding.
- Julie!

982
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:23.290
- God!
- Pull over, Julie, please!

983
01:19:23.366 --> 01:19:24.663
Please, pull over.

984
01:19:24.734 --> 01:19:27.225
I'm sorry!
I love you!

985
01:19:27.303 --> 01:19:30.204
I didn't know!
I'm sorry!

986
01:19:30.273 --> 01:19:33.674
Julie, you have to
pull over!

987
01:19:33.743 --> 01:19:36.371
Pull over!
You don't understand!

988
01:19:36.446 --> 01:19:37.777
Please!

989
01:19:43.686 --> 01:19:45.415
Oh my God.

990
01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:49.955
I love you.

991
01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.504
I would do anything
for all you guys.

992
01:20:06.576 --> 01:20:08.908
You know that,
don't you?

993
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:46.549
Hey, Nick.
You're awake.

994
01:20:47.884 --> 01:20:50.148
Come on, baby,
we've got a big day.

995
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.085
I've got class
in a half-hour.

996
01:20:56.159 --> 01:20:58.491
Ah...

997
01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:00.688
That's right,
Nicky, yeah!

998
01:21:00.763 --> 01:21:03.027
Aw...

999
01:21:03.099 --> 01:21:05.363
Mommy has to go to class
in a half an hour.

1000
01:21:05.435 --> 01:21:07.995
That's right. Okay?

1001
01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:10.767
I'm gonna drop you off
at Grandma's. Yeah!
