**

2
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:06.507
* Dick pulls the sheets away

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.743
* Says, Jane, you look the same
as you did yesterday *

4
00:00:09.777 --> 00:00:12.413
* Not the week before

5
00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.282
* Jane where's my head today?

6
00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.750
* Ear left the pillow
and my eyes float away *

7
00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:19.287
* Got a mind to be outdoors

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.323
* And where
should we go? *

9
00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.293
* And where should we go?

10
00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:28.729
* And where
should we go? *

11
00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.233
* (whistling)

12
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.239
* Jane, lose those
training wheels *

13
00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.708
* The thought of leaving
is so surreal *

14
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.277
* Don't leave
this thought alone *

15
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:45.713
* Two wheels and handlebars

16
00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.249
* Can't see for the street signs
and the motor cars *

17
00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:51.085
* Let's find the open road

18
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:54.155
* And where
should we go? *

19
00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:56.790
* And where should we go?

20
00:00:56.824 --> 00:01:00.094
* And where
should we go? *

21
00:01:00.128 --> 00:01:02.163
* (whistling)

22
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.670
* Dick, dear, the sun is low

23
00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:15.276
* I'll lift my feet
and let the wheels roll *

24
00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:16.444
**

25
00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:18.612
(phones ringing)

26
00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.848
(indistinct chatter)

27
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.683
Welcome
to Spontaneous Travel.

28
00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.185
How may I assist you?

29
00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:26.520
I have an overnight delivery
for an Amy Tyler.

30
00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.722
Oh, that'll be
the productivity pod
on your left.

31
00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.258
Thanks.
You're welcome.

32
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.259
(mutters)
Start-ups.

33
00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:32.726
Have a spontaneous day!

34
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.262
(man)
Yes, sir, I can imagine

35
00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:36.197
it's not very fun
in Syria right now,

36
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.767
but traveler's insurance
does not cover political unrest.

37
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.835
Amy Tyler?

38
00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.537
Can you hold on
a mo-mo?

39
00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:44.838
Can I help you?

40
00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:46.840
Yeah, urgent
for Amy Tyler?

41
00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:48.542
I'll sign.

42
00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:51.179
Amy, it's here!

43
00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:52.880
Just in time.

44
00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:55.283
If I'm not careful,
you could replace me.

45
00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:57.818
Oh, I could never
be a ginger. Here.

46
00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:58.819
Oh!

47
00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.522
**

48
00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:05.359
(gasps)
Robert, you are a life saver.

49
00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:07.295
Okay, my turn.
The Wainwrights
are in Sweden?

50
00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:08.662
You mean Syria?

51
00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:09.763
That, and then
there's also a thingy.

52
00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:11.532
A military coup?

53
00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:12.733
I don't know, listening
is not really my thing.

54
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:13.867
What about reading
or watching the news?

55
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:15.303
Oh, gross.

56
00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:17.405
Get Phillipe
at Hotel Plaka on the line.

57
00:02:17.438 --> 00:02:19.273
I'll take care of the rest.

58
00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:20.741
That's why you're gonna
own this place someday.

59
00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.776
No, that's why I'll
sell this place someday.

60
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.480
Mr. Wainwright, it's Amy
from Spontaneous Travel.

61
00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.950
I understand you're having
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

62
00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.886
Let's see if we can't
find you a better one.

63
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.390
Yes, sir, I'm looking
at a direct flight to Athens

64
00:02:36.424 --> 00:02:38.226
that leaves in two hours,

65
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.661
and we will transfer your
hotel reservation at no charge.

66
00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.263
I've got Phillipe
on the other line,

67
00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:43.864
who will take
great care of you.

68
00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.334
Direct Message me if you
need anything after hours.

69
00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:49.570
No, thank you for
choosing Spontaneous Travel,

70
00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:50.904
where we plan...

71
00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:52.840
(all)
...for you to improvise.

72
00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.276
You have every luxury hotel
on speed dial,

73
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.278
and I'm shooting my videos
in an active coffee shop.

74
00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:58.779
Vanilla hemp latte
for Sandra!

75
00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.448
Right here!

76
00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:02.283
You don't spend three years
making travel videos

77
00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:03.884
in Europe without getting
to know a few hotel managers.

78
00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.820
Yeah, and you don't create
a start-up travel agency.

79
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.422
Global Concierge.

80
00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:09.923
Ugh, global concierge,

81
00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.560
without it being
more than a few.

82
00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:13.727
All I'm saying is you
could hook a girl up.

83
00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:15.596
Wait, is that why you called?

84
00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.630
No!
No.

85
00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:18.532
We wanna know if it came.

86
00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:21.269
You mean, this?

87
00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:22.770
(chuckling)
Aaah!

88
00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.738
Yay, what are we celebrating?

89
00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:26.740
Take a bow, Robert.

90
00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:30.278
I'd like to thank the Academy
and my husband, Anderson Cooper.

91
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.446
I still can't believe you got
a passport in less than a week.

92
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.382
Who knew the Department of State
was on Grindr?

93
00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:35.549
Ding-ding goes the trolley.

94
00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:37.251
That makes so much sense.

95
00:03:37.285 --> 00:03:38.852
And Josh
still has no idea?

96
00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:41.489
Nope! I cleared the dates
with his firm,

97
00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.657
booked the flights,
even double-dipped
on a few discounts

98
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.925
because we have
different last names.

99
00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.794
I planned it perfectly.

100
00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:48.396
Except,
you forgot to check

101
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:49.997
if your boyfriend's passport
had expired.

102
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.032
That's why I have Robert.

103
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.034
Did you confirm
the Wainwrights' Athens flight?

104
00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.569
Oh, Ames, that's
so five minutes ago.

105
00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.671
I even got them a Groupon
for the Aeropostale.

106
00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:58.972
You mean
the Acropolis, right?

107
00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.576
Your trip with Josh
is gonna be so amazing!

108
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.011
It's gonna
be perfect, Amy.

109
00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.414
You could just chill out
and focus on seeing

110
00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:07.881
all your favorite places
in the world.

111
00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:09.483
With your favorite man
in the world!

112
00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:10.551
Barf!

113
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:11.852
That sounds so cheesy,

114
00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.288
but so amazing
that I don't care!

115
00:04:14.322 --> 00:04:16.290
And Josh has always
talked about proposing

116
00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:18.759
in front of that fountain
where his grandparents met.

117
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:19.793
I told you about that?

118
00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:21.529
(all)
Only ten times.

119
00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:23.297
I hope he can just
take the hint.

120
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:25.299
Men can be so oblivious.
You're telling me.

121
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:27.635
I reminded him about dinner
tonight, and he tried to pretend

122
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:29.537
he had something
really important planned,

123
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.505
but I am pretty sure
he just forgot.

124
00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.007
Or maybe he's planning
a little surprise of his own.

125
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:35.909
No.

126
00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.711
You think?

127
00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.780
Oh, but he knows
I hate surprises.

128
00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:42.015
Honey, you've cashed in
thousands of dollars

129
00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:43.851
and dozens of favors
for this trip.

130
00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:46.754
In a month, I better see
two carats, or a new man.

131
00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.722
Oh, my gosh, I'd love
to plan your wedding.

132
00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:50.658
Ew, no!
Absolutely not!

133
00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:52.460
All right, all right,
all right.

134
00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:54.628
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

135
00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:57.030
Right now, I just have to focus
on getting to dinner on time.

136
00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:58.566
You mean five minutes ago?

137
00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.100
Crap, yes.
Robert...

138
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.068
Already Uber-ing.

139
00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.110
Oh, sorry I'm late.

140
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.512
Oh, um--

141
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:14.815
I was just finishing up
your surprise.

142
00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:16.750
Amy Tyler,
late for something.

143
00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:18.352
The apocalypse is nigh.

144
00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:20.654
For our anniversary,
grumpy pants.

145
00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:22.423
Yeah, Amy,
about that, um...

146
00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:23.824
Can I just tell you
what your surprise is?

147
00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.025
Well, I think
we really need to--

148
00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.026
And I cannot keep
a secret so--

149
00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.728
Amy! Just...

150
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.399
Yeah, I'm just gonna
give you two a minute.

151
00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:40.107
Amy, you're a great girl,
and we've had a lot of fun...

152
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.809
But this doesn't
sound very fun.

153
00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.744
I just feel like things
are moving too fast.

154
00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:45.546
We've been dating
for two years.

155
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.415
I know.
We live together.

156
00:05:47.448 --> 00:05:48.782
Exactly.

157
00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:50.150
I'm just not ready for
this kind of commitment.

158
00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.453
Well...
I'm not saying

159
00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:53.521
we have to get married
right now.

160
00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:54.788
Oh, thank God.

161
00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:56.990
(chuckling)
Great! Good.

162
00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.092
No, I'm glad we're
on the same page with this,

163
00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.694
because I feel like
you're always making

164
00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:02.896
these big, romantic gestures
and wanting to spend

165
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.598
all this time and money
together.

166
00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:07.901
And I just don't
want to do that anymore.

167
00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:11.972
So...

168
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:13.641
Ahh. Good.

169
00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.809
Whew! Heh.

170
00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:19.580
Uh, that went much better
than I thought it would.

171
00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:20.648
What did you want
to talk about?

172
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.986
I booked us a-- a two-week trip
to Europe for our anniversary.

173
00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:29.056
What? Are you--
Are you crazy?

174
00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.624
I-- I can't
take two weeks off.

175
00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:32.159
No, I cleared it
with your boss.

176
00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:33.594
You talked to Mike
behind my back?

177
00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:35.496
That's how a surprise works.

178
00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.130
What am I gonna do
in Europe for two weeks?

179
00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:39.166
You love Europe.

180
00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.469
You studied abroad
in Amsterdam.

181
00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:42.970
We met dancing in Ibiza.

182
00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:44.672
You've always wanted
to propose at the fountain

183
00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:45.973
where your grandparents met.

184
00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:48.208
Amy, I told you that on,
like, our third date.

185
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.843
I thought
it was romantic.

186
00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:51.479
I thought it would
get me laid.

187
00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:53.981
Just gonna take another lap
around, no rush.

188
00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:58.919
Well, I wish I'd known that
before I fell in love with you.

189
00:06:58.952 --> 00:07:01.589
I wish I'd known that before
we moved in together.

190
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:03.691
And I really wish
I'd known that

191
00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:05.526
before I booked us
a non-refundable

192
00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.061
two-week trip to Europe
for our anniversary.

193
00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.598
Amy, I think a vacation
is a great idea.

194
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:12.600
You know, just maybe...

195
00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:17.605
...from each other.

196
00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:19.172
Are you breaking up
with me?

197
00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:20.474
No!

198
00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:22.676
I mean...

199
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.678
if that's
what you want.

200
00:07:24.712 --> 00:07:26.547
What I want
is to be with someone

201
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.682
who sees a future
with me.

202
00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.183
I'm not a fortune teller,
Amy.

203
00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:35.255
Well, at least
I already started packing.

204
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.157
Amy, wait.

205
00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:40.794
What are you gonna do
with that ticket?

206
00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:43.897
So maybe I can get it
exchanged for another time?

207
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:45.833
(Marcie)
I am gonna taze his ass!

208
00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:47.635
(Sandra)
Amy, you can stay
as long as you need.

209
00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:49.202
Why didn't you
make him move out?

210
00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:50.804
Eff this,
I'm ordering a pizza.

211
00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:52.973
We've earned it.
You've gotta still go, Ames.

212
00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:55.743
I would kill to see Turkey!
Literally murder bodies.

213
00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:56.977
The girl
just got dumped.

214
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.145
What's she gonna do
in Turkey?

215
00:07:58.178 --> 00:07:59.747
Well, we don't know
his name yet.

216
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.214
Marcie's right.

217
00:08:01.248 --> 00:08:02.883
I can't go anywhere
right now.

218
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.218
I don't even have
a place to live.

219
00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:07.688
It was a stupid idea anyway.

220
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.690
Amy, you dropped, like,
thousands on this trip.

221
00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:10.758
Of your own money.

222
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:11.759
At least give me
the tickets.

223
00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.226
You don't understand.

224
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.895
They're nontransferable.

225
00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:17.030
Our names
are on everything.

226
00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:20.601
Plane tickets, hotels, tours,
even dinner reservations.

227
00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:22.002
I can't go without him.

228
00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:24.938
Amy, I am so sorry,

229
00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.540
but we're
your girls, okay?

230
00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:28.308
And we're here for you.
For anything.

231
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.177
Can we do
a gluten-free crust?
I'm on a thing.

232
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.713
The next time that
Josh Merit parks anywhere,

233
00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.882
I'm gonna be there
to turn that meter off

234
00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.283
and ticket his ass.

235
00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:37.951
Wait, you can do that?

236
00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:39.019
But you have to forget
about him, okay?

237
00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.588
Forget about this trip.

238
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.089
(phone alert)
Maybe that's him!

239
00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:44.191
What part of "take her
damn phone away from her"

240
00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:45.659
did you not understand?

241
00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:46.960
Please, she's too sober
to drunk dial.

242
00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.629
Bitch, you are not
a Breathalyzer.

243
00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:50.631
He changed
our relationship status.

244
00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:51.899
What?!
Ouch.

245
00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:53.266
He listed himself
as single,

246
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.036
so now it says
I'm single, too.

247
00:08:57.838 --> 00:08:59.172
I guess it's official.

248
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.273
And it wasn't official
when he turned down

249
00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:02.075
an all-expenses-paid
vacation?

250
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.644
Yeah, he should have at least
led her on for another two weeks

251
00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.979
and gotten a free trip
and vacation sex out of it.

252
00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:07.581
What?
Girl, I'm gon--

253
00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.016
He changed
his profile picture.

254
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.017
Sandra, I need
your computer.

255
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.318
No, Amy, calm down.

256
00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.953
What if it's
with a new girl?

257
00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:14.221
The new picture won't
load on my phone.

258
00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:15.255
Girl,
take the hint!

259
00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.790
Okay!
Okay, grabby.

260
00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:18.091
Pizza's on you, then.

261
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.293
Why can't I
find him on here?

262
00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:22.162
Did he block me?!

263
00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:23.330
Breathe.

264
00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:24.832
It's logged
into my profile.

265
00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:25.999
I am not friends
with the A-hole

266
00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.167
formally known
as your boyfriend.

267
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.836
Okay, just search for him.

268
00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:31.071
And once you're done,
we can go to the club.

269
00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:34.007
He changed his picture, so I
can't tell which one he is.

270
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.944
Whoa, there must be at least
a dozen Josh Merits on here.

271
00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:38.979
Okay, I think
this one's him.

272
00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:41.248
Okay, see?
No new girl.

273
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:42.816
Just a bunch
of douche-nozzles
doing shots.

274
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.952
Wait, no, go back!

275
00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:46.687
No, this is him, Sandra.

276
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.355
We don't need to look
at a bunch of random guys.

277
00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:49.690
Yes, you do!

278
00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:50.924
Huh?
What?

279
00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.027
You need
a new Josh Merit.

280
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:55.629
Now, I know
you're not thinking

281
00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:57.330
what I think
you're thinking.

282
00:09:57.364 --> 00:09:59.833
Honestly, this is the best
idea I've ever had.

283
00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:02.269
(chuckling)
No, no, no.

284
00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:03.403
Absolutely not!

285
00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.672
Come on!

286
00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:05.773
The best way
to get over one guy

287
00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.040
is to get on top
of another one.

288
00:10:07.074 --> 00:10:08.341
This one time,
it's a good plan.

289
00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:09.943
I mean,
think about it.

290
00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:11.712
You've already prepaid
for this two-week

291
00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:14.014
dream vacation
with a Josh Merit.

292
00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:16.349
You can't change the tickets,
but you can change the guy.

293
00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:18.051
This is ridiculous.

294
00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.720
This way, you get
to keep your trip,

295
00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:22.422
your plan, and maybe
even find a rebound.

296
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.725
You'll never have to worry
about saying the wrong name.

297
00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:27.294
I am not taking
a stranger to Europe!

298
00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:28.929
Isn't that what you do
for a living?

299
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.330
Well, what if he's
a total creep? Hmm?

300
00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:32.032
Or a knife-stabber.

301
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:34.301
This is the whole reason
that I stopped making videos

302
00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:36.436
and dealt with
other people's travel.

303
00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.339
People are unpredictable.

304
00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:40.974
Like Josh.

305
00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:42.142
(patrons chattering)

306
00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:43.376
Okay.

307
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.045
Do you wanna make
a pro and con list?

308
00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:46.079
No.

309
00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:47.280
But you love
pro and con lists.

310
00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.349
I do.
Okay.

311
00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.985
You get to relive
Amy's Adventures.

312
00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:53.987
I haven't vlogged
in years.

313
00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:55.889
Meet new people!
I hate people.

314
00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:57.390
Well, we'll run
a background check.

315
00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.892
Make sure you're safe.

316
00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:00.093
You're a parking enforcement
officer.

317
00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:01.428
I still work
for the state.

318
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.096
And we can figure out
where these guys hang out

319
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.898
and go window shopping.

320
00:11:04.932 --> 00:11:07.735
I can't just write a bunch
of random men online.

321
00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.302
What would I even say?

322
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.871
"Hi, we've never met,

323
00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:12.840
"but you've won a free trip
to Europe!

324
00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:14.708
"And also, there's
a Nigerian prince

325
00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:16.343
with an exciting
financial opportunity."

326
00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.311
Who is gonna turn down
a free trip?

327
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.714
Better yet, offer them
a deal on the tickets

328
00:11:20.748 --> 00:11:22.049
and make some
of your money back.

329
00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:23.283
What am I,
Living Social?

330
00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.752
No, you're
"Living Single."

331
00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.086
All you have to do

332
00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:28.288
is write a few
Josh Merits.

333
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.790
We'll take care
of the rest.

334
00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:31.892
Guys, come on.

335
00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:33.126
Do you really expect me

336
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.295
to contact every guy
on the Internet

337
00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:36.429
with my ex's name?

338
00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:37.965
No!

339
00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:40.067
Just the cute ones.

340
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.468
I heard that!

341
00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:47.140
Where do we start?
Yes!

342
00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:48.441
**

343
00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.744
(Marcie)
You don't waste any time.

344
00:11:50.778 --> 00:11:51.979
Yeah, maybe this
was a bad idea.

345
00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:53.146
Uh, d-d-d-- no.

346
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.247
Hold on!
No, no.

347
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:55.783
That's him.

348
00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:57.885
(Marcie)
Who?
Our first Josh Merit.

349
00:11:57.918 --> 00:11:59.787
I posted that I was
looking to book Josh Merit

350
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.122
on my show, the Internet
took care of the rest.

351
00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.523
You can find anyone.

352
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.225
Except a sponsor
for her YouTube channel.

353
00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:06.794
Focus, ladies.

354
00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.228
He's a 30-year-old
musician from Tennessee

355
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:09.529
with a body like Ryan Lochte

356
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.831
and a voice that sounds
like rainbows.

357
00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:13.066
He is the definition
of a rebound,

358
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.367
and he's standing
right over there.

359
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.903
Ladies and ladies,

360
00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:19.039
please welcome our first
contestant, Josh Merit.

361
00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:22.542
How old
is that photo?

362
00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.978
Girl, if you don't
go over there, I will.

363
00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:29.182
I-- I--
I can do it!

364
00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:31.018
OMG! Josh...

365
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.786
Yeah, Abby?
I love you.

366
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.921
Yeah.

367
00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:36.189
Are you gonna play
"Falling" tonight?

368
00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:37.557
Yeah, I think I can
make that happen.

369
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.193
(squeals and laughs)

370
00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:42.029
Can we take
a picture together?

371
00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:43.163
Can you?

372
00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:44.998
Uh...

373
00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:46.333
On three, say,

374
00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.936
"I mistake attention
for love."

375
00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:50.503
(camera clicks)

376
00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:52.039
All right.

377
00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:53.473
I'm your biggest fan.

378
00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:54.474
See you after
the show, Josh.

379
00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.976
Yeah, okay, thanks.

380
00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.313
Sorry about that.
Do you--

381
00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.882
Did you wanna
get a photo?

382
00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:03.050
Oh, God, no, heh.

383
00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:04.517
I'm sorry.
No, okay.

384
00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:06.219
It's-- it's cool.

385
00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:09.222
I personally prefer
to be heard and not seen.

386
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.524
So how long have you
been playing?

387
00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:13.426
Oh, wow, you really
did not come here

388
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.895
to hear me play music,
did you?

389
00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:17.597
No. I'm sorry.

390
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.999
No, no, don't worry
about it.

391
00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:21.534
It's, uh,
it's actually refreshing.

392
00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:23.236
And who knows?

393
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.238
Maybe Josh Merit can make
a fan out of you tonight.

394
00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:28.208
Yeah, you're gonna
have to work really hard

395
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:31.444
to make me a fan
of Josh Merit right now.

396
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.847
You know, um,
I'm usually surrounded

397
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:36.516
by either fans or crazies.

398
00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:40.020
But it's nice to meet,
you know, someone like you.

399
00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:40.787
(chuckles)

400
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.924
You know,
sometimes I just fantasize

401
00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:45.926
about just taking a trip.

402
00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.595
You know, just...
get away from it all.

403
00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:50.497
Well, it-- it's funny
you should mention that

404
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.100
because, um,
this is crazy, actually.

405
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.502
This is, like, the weirdest
thing I've ever done
in my entire life...

406
00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.104
(man)
Put your hands together

407
00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:59.639
for the very talented
Josh Merit!

408
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.208
(cheers and applause)
That is my cue.

409
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:04.277
Um, thank you for
accidentally coming tonight.

410
00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:08.215
And whoever you are actually
looking for is a lucky guy.

411
00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:10.350
Come on, San Francisco!

412
00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:12.552
We can do
better than that!

413
00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:14.621
(cheers and applause)

414
00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.126
Yeah, I didn't get
to ask him yet.

415
00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.894
Uh, but he was nice.
That's good.

416
00:14:20.928 --> 00:14:24.197
...and this is Josh Merit
and the Paper Heart Band.

417
00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:26.299
He's cute.
He's really cute.

418
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:31.504
And this first song
is dedicated to a new fan.

419
00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:35.675
She, uh... just might
not know it yet.

420
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.377
**

421
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.049
* You've got that

422
00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:47.955
* You've got
that beautiful *

423
00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:51.992
(growling)
* Murder face, ah

424
00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:55.462
* Murder face

425
00:14:55.495 --> 00:15:00.633
* Blood in your eyes
and poison in your smile *

426
00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.169
* Kill! Kill!

427
00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:04.637
Dear Josh,
you don't know me,

428
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:09.109
but I am in a weird situation
and need your help.

429
00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.678
**

430
00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:18.185
My ex-boyfriend
is also named Josh Merit.

431
00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:20.087
And before we broke up,

432
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.422
I booked a nonrefundable
vacation under his name.

433
00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:27.294
* For some strange reason
I can't get you off my mind *

434
00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:29.196
**

435
00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:31.731
So, I was curious
if you'd be interested

436
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:34.634
in a no-strings-attached,
platonic trip to Europe

437
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.736
for a fraction
of the ticket price.

438
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.106
* Well, I guess we'll just
chalk this one up *

439
00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:43.110
* To another lovesick fool

440
00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:47.014
* 'Cause nighttime falls

441
00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:51.384
* And I think
you're no good for me *

442
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.320
**

443
00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:58.358
* But I keep falling
for your love in the morning *

444
00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:03.630
* When the sun
burns up the sky *

445
00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:06.966
* I just come crawling

446
00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:13.406
* But I keep falling
for your love in the morning *

447
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.009
If you're interested
and have a valid passport,

448
00:16:16.043 --> 00:16:17.677
write me back as soon
as possible,

449
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.612
and I'll give
you more details.

450
00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.981
Thanks, Amy.

451
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.418
* When the morning comes

452
00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:30.557
* Well, I just keep on falling

453
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.392
(Sandra)
Ugh, where is he?

454
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.693
I thought you said
he'd be here.

455
00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.262
(Amy)
This is exhausting.

456
00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:37.164
Now I actually
need a vacation.

457
00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:39.032
Look, it's been
almost a week, Amy.

458
00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:40.567
We're not looking
for your soul mate,

459
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.203
just a double to get you checked
into airports and hotels.

460
00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:46.739
Okay, this final candidate
is Joshua Merit.

461
00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:49.109
He's originally
from Minnesota.

462
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:50.810
He got his masters
at UCLA,

463
00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.513
taught kindergarten until last
week with the state cutbacks,

464
00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:56.349
has no criminal record
and type O positive blood.

465
00:16:56.383 --> 00:16:57.584
Well, that's a deal breaker.

466
00:16:57.617 --> 00:16:59.252
You know she likes
her men type A.

467
00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.388
How do you find
all this information?

468
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:02.455
You can find anything
on the Internet.

469
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:03.456
Really?
How big is his--

470
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.292
Stop!
I swear you guys

471
00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:07.460
are more invested
in my love life than I am.

472
00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:09.662
Wait, I think
that's him!

473
00:17:11.731 --> 00:17:13.800
He looks so sad.

474
00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.268
Well, he did just
lose his job.

475
00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:17.104
And he drives
a scooter.

476
00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:19.139
(Amy)
I can't really tell
what he looks like.

477
00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:20.373
Well, all I can tell
from here is he's got

478
00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:23.343
the buttocks
of a thoroughbred stallion.

479
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.344
Wait, he's looking
over here!

480
00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:25.778
Oh, okay.

481
00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:27.714
What are you doing?

482
00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:29.849
He doesn't know what
you look like, crazy pants.

483
00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.719
Okay, your flight leaves
in 24 hours, Amy.

484
00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:34.121
You can't afford
to be picky.

485
00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:35.455
Maybe I just
shouldn't go.

486
00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:38.091
No! He wrote back
and said he was interested.

487
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:40.660
We've seen every
Josh Merit in the city.

488
00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:41.828
This Josh'll do.

489
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:43.563
And if it doesn't
work out,

490
00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.165
you can just give him
his return ticket
and then go meet

491
00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:46.599
some mysterious stranger
who doesn't speak English

492
00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:49.602
but makes you orgasm
in five languages.

493
00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:51.704
(sighs)
I worry about you.

494
00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:54.574
Me too.
Okay...

495
00:17:54.607 --> 00:17:57.510
Fifty Shades of Gross here
has got it right.

496
00:17:57.544 --> 00:17:59.612
You need this, Amy.

497
00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:02.182
Besides, whatever Josh
you take with you to Europe

498
00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:03.716
is better than the one
you had.

499
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.686
**

500
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.553
Uh, oh.
Oh, uh, Josh?

501
00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:42.489
I still think you
should have gone with
Personal Trainer Josh.

502
00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:45.158
Well, this is the only one that
said yes to my offer, okay?

503
00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:47.294
Wow, even my standards
are higher than that.

504
00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:49.496
This Josh is single,
drug-free,

505
00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:50.763
and as far as we know,
not a knife-stabber.

506
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.166
Okay?
We're lucky he said yes.

507
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.735
Those are impressive credentials
for any man from the Bay Area,
regardless of name.

508
00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:57.770
I mean,
if the state trusts him
to teach children,

509
00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.239
I'm gonna trust him
with you.

510
00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:01.308
Not to mention,
he has a valid passport.

511
00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:02.375
And a great butt.

512
00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:05.878
What? It's important!

513
00:19:05.912 --> 00:19:08.248
Okay, remember we have
to pretend like we've
never seen him before.

514
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:09.882
So, put the sign back up
and play it up.

515
00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:11.651
And, Sandra,
try not to hit on him.

516
00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:13.953
But how will I resist
his unemployed,

517
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.822
scooter-riding charm?

518
00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:18.391
Regardless of anything,
I just want you to know

519
00:19:18.425 --> 00:19:20.293
I'm really proud of you,
Amy.

520
00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:22.562
I mean, you could've
stayed home sulking

521
00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:25.432
and missed out on a trip of
a lifetime, but you didn't.

522
00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:26.666
I know.

523
00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:29.669
I mean, this is crazy,

524
00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:31.504
but I'm actually
kind of excited about it.

525
00:19:31.538 --> 00:19:33.706
And at least someone's
getting to use the ticket.

526
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.375
He seems like
he really needs it.

527
00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:36.576
You know who
really needs it...

528
00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:37.744
Wait, guys!
I think this is him.

529
00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:38.978
Play it cool.

530
00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.881
** (heavy metal music)

531
00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:44.851
**

532
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.527
(music slows to a stop)

533
00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.531
Hey.
Uh, sorry I'm late.

534
00:19:58.565 --> 00:19:59.532
I'm Joshua.

535
00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:01.234
"Josh."

536
00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:03.002
You couldn't
have shaved?

537
00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.437
Or at least showered?

538
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.772
Uh, sorry.

539
00:20:05.805 --> 00:20:07.774
Thought we were gonna be
on a plane for 12 hours.

540
00:20:07.807 --> 00:20:08.975
Don't worry
about her.

541
00:20:09.008 --> 00:20:10.009
I don't mind
the scruff, heh.

542
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.010
Thank you.

543
00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.879
Uh, Amy, I'm guessing?

544
00:20:12.912 --> 00:20:15.448
No, it's nice to meet you
though, Joshua.

545
00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:17.317
I'm Sandra.

546
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.321
Who will be
staying here, with me.

547
00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:23.456
This is Amy.

548
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.891
Hi, Amy.

549
00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:27.660
I mean... I'm Amy.

550
00:20:27.694 --> 00:20:30.497
Hi, Amy. Uh, Jo--

551
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.764
Uh, we already did that.

552
00:20:31.798 --> 00:20:33.733
Um, can I help you
with your bag?

553
00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:36.469
Uh, do you
have a bag?

554
00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:38.271
Uh, didn't have
much of a heads-up,

555
00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.573
so just threw everything
in a backpack and left.

556
00:20:40.607 --> 00:20:42.475
Have you ever
tried a rolling bag?

557
00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:44.877
Have you ever tried not
micromanaging other people?

558
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.979
Okay, Joshua.

559
00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:48.515
See, the thing is,
Amy here,

560
00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:49.949
she's calling
all the shots.

561
00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:51.418
Except in the bedroom.

562
00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:52.552
Then she likes
a little dominance,

563
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:53.553
and her safe word
is "stop."

564
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:54.821
Guys...

565
00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:56.889
Everything is in both
of your names,

566
00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.858
so if you can't play nice,
you may as well walk away now

567
00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:00.527
or you'll be
limping away later.

568
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.761
You don't have
to play nice
with me.

569
00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:02.929
I like
limping away.

570
00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:04.897
Seriously?
Wow, heh.

571
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:07.767
Maybe I should
get my return ticket now
for safe-keeping, huh?

572
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.968
Sure!

573
00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.403
And if you
wouldn't mind waiting

574
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.938
until at least Sunday
to dump me.

575
00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:12.939
I've already been through
that once this week.

576
00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:15.775
Okay? Everybody happy?

577
00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:17.644
Great.
Here's your boarding pass.

578
00:21:17.677 --> 00:21:19.646
I'm glad you came,
I'll see you on the plane.

579
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.448
Amy...

580
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.350
(indistinct PA announcement)

581
00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:25.552
Is she okay?

582
00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:28.521
Don't worry, she's
much more friendly
at 30,000 feet.

583
00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:30.723
And don't forget--
any funny business,

584
00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:33.059
I won't be afraid
to use this.

585
00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:34.494
Did that say
Parking Enforcement?

586
00:21:34.527 --> 00:21:36.996
Just get on
the damn plane!

587
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:39.866
Okay, folks,
I need two lines!

588
00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:42.001
Okay, have
your documentation out.

589
00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:43.002
I'm not going anywhere.

590
00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.071
Next!

591
00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:46.473
Sir, step up, please.

592
00:21:46.506 --> 00:21:48.007
Sorry.
It's, uh, early for me.

593
00:21:54.013 --> 00:21:55.548
Hmm...

594
00:21:55.582 --> 00:21:56.816
The name
on your boarding pass

595
00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:58.885
doesn't match the name
on your passport.

596
00:21:58.918 --> 00:22:00.319
Uh... let me see.

597
00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:05.057
No. Says right there,
"Josh Merit."

598
00:22:05.091 --> 00:22:08.060
It says
Michael Joshua Merit.

599
00:22:08.094 --> 00:22:10.497
Yeah, so Michael Josh Merit.

600
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.831
That don't fly.

601
00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:13.366
Well I mean, not flying

602
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.402
is not really an option
right now, so...

603
00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:18.137
I won't allow you to board
with the wrong documentation.

604
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.072
Are you serious?

605
00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:22.141
There's nothing wrong
with my documentation.

606
00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:24.143
Do I look
like a terrorist?

607
00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.578
You wanna check up
my butt, see if there's
anything up there?

608
00:22:25.612 --> 00:22:26.579
Oh, I know
something's up there,

609
00:22:26.613 --> 00:22:27.880
but you want me
to find out.

610
00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:29.716
Ah, you must say that
to all the guys.

611
00:22:29.749 --> 00:22:31.684
I'm sorry. Is--
Is there a problem?

612
00:22:31.718 --> 00:22:33.853
Uh, yeah, honey bear.

613
00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:37.089
Uh, you used the wrong name
on the tickets.

614
00:22:37.123 --> 00:22:40.593
That's funny, I thought
Josh Merit was correct.

615
00:22:40.627 --> 00:22:41.894
You two are
traveling together?

616
00:22:41.928 --> 00:22:42.962
She does this
all the time.

617
00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:44.864
I-- What?
Uh...

618
00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:47.099
Josh was my middle name,
pumpkin.
Really?

619
00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:48.401
You don't know
your man's middle name?

620
00:22:48.435 --> 00:22:50.403
She means, really?

621
00:22:50.437 --> 00:22:52.439
That makes
a difference?

622
00:22:52.472 --> 00:22:55.442
I'm gonna have to ask
the two of you to step aside.

623
00:22:55.475 --> 00:22:57.076
I cannot believe
I got talked into this.

624
00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:58.110
What were you thinking?

625
00:22:58.144 --> 00:23:00.413
What were
my parents thinking?

626
00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:03.950
Exactly. Michael
is a terrible name.
Hey, my name's Michael.

627
00:23:03.983 --> 00:23:05.785
Well, don't tell her that.
She'll get all crazy.

628
00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:06.986
I should have gone
with any of the other guys
that I looked at.

629
00:23:07.019 --> 00:23:08.721
Well, that's
just hurtful.

630
00:23:08.755 --> 00:23:10.623
Even the guy who dealt drugs
would have been better than you!

631
00:23:10.657 --> 00:23:12.559
Ma'am, do you have something
that you would like to declare?

632
00:23:12.592 --> 00:23:15.127
Uh, Pookie-bear, let's not
make the nice man upset.

633
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:17.664
I just wanted to take
a nice trip to Europe.

634
00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:20.132
You have ruined everything.
Oh, sure, this
is all my fault.

635
00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:22.201
No matter what I do,
no matter how hard I try,

636
00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.203
nothing goes right!
Nothing goes right for you?

637
00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.972
What about me?
I just lost my job!

638
00:23:26.005 --> 00:23:28.675
I just wanted
to go to Europe!

639
00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:29.742
I just wanted
to help children!

640
00:23:29.776 --> 00:23:31.978
I am gonna
die alone!

641
00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:33.580
It's like you
don't even know me!

642
00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:34.914
Oh, hell. Uhh!

643
00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:36.449
Go on, it's fine.

644
00:23:36.483 --> 00:23:37.650
Really?

645
00:23:37.684 --> 00:23:39.486
Thank you so much.

646
00:23:42.689 --> 00:23:43.990
Y'all crazy.

647
00:23:44.023 --> 00:23:46.092
We're in therapy.

648
00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:58.070
See?
That wasn't so bad.

649
00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:02.875
You were great back there,
by the way.

650
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:05.011
Let's be clear--
I'm not going to let anything

651
00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:07.547
take this trip
away from me, okay?

652
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.849
Okay.

653
00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:12.685
Thank you,
by the way.

654
00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:14.253
For everything.

655
00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:17.624
You have no idea how
badly I needed this.

656
00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:19.992
Well... me, too.

657
00:24:20.026 --> 00:24:22.962
So... thank you.

658
00:24:22.995 --> 00:24:26.132
Uh, before I forget...

659
00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.868
this should cover
my half of the trip.

660
00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:31.738
It was a great deal,
by the way.

661
00:24:31.771 --> 00:24:33.105
You got really lucky.

662
00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:34.807
(scoffs)
It wasn't luck.

663
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:36.843
It took a lot of careful
planning and scheduling.

664
00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:38.077
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

665
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.679
Yes, sir, can I
get you anything?

666
00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:41.213
Could I get a scotch and soda
before takeoff?

667
00:24:41.247 --> 00:24:42.214
Of course, sir.

668
00:24:42.248 --> 00:24:43.282
Thanks.

669
00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:46.586
(sighs and clears throat)

670
00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:48.120
What?

671
00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:49.922
It's a little early,
isn't it?

672
00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:54.226
Um... I thought we were
going on vacation, right?

673
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.763
And did I mention,
free scotch?

674
00:24:56.796 --> 00:25:00.667
See, um, this is really more
of a retreat than a binge.

675
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.669
I'm just having a drink
to calm my nerves.

676
00:25:02.702 --> 00:25:04.103
Well, it would
really calm my nerves

677
00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:06.238
if I knew I wasn't traveling
with an alcoholic.

678
00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:08.174
What are you, Mormon?
It's one drink!

679
00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:10.677
I don't know
anything about you.

680
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.746
Like, apparently, I don't even
know your real name, Michael!

681
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.082
Look, no one's called me
Michael since I was seven.

682
00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:17.950
Uh, Michael?
What?

683
00:25:17.984 --> 00:25:19.619
Uh, your drink.

684
00:25:19.652 --> 00:25:20.887
Thanks. Sorry.

685
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.622
Enjoy.

686
00:25:22.655 --> 00:25:24.691
Lush.

687
00:25:24.724 --> 00:25:26.559
Actually,
you know what, Miss?

688
00:25:26.593 --> 00:25:28.260
Let's make it a double.
Sure thing.

689
00:25:28.294 --> 00:25:29.562
Seriously?

690
00:25:29.596 --> 00:25:30.630
When in Rome.

691
00:25:30.663 --> 00:25:33.199
Look... this is just

692
00:25:33.232 --> 00:25:35.735
a really sensitive time
for me,

693
00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:37.269
and I need to know
you're not a creep.

694
00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:39.772
You approached me
on the Internet!

695
00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:41.540
I thought we were
way past creepy.

696
00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:44.977
You want
your return ticket?

697
00:25:45.011 --> 00:25:47.814
Fine.

698
00:25:47.847 --> 00:25:49.181
When we land,

699
00:25:49.215 --> 00:25:51.884
you can just turn around
and go right back home!

700
00:25:51.918 --> 00:25:53.986
Come on. Seriously?

701
00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:58.891
Fine.

702
00:25:58.925 --> 00:26:00.993
If it will make you
uncomfortable,

703
00:26:01.027 --> 00:26:02.261
I won't drink.

704
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.931
Thank you.

705
00:26:04.964 --> 00:26:06.966
Sorry.
Mom won't let me.

706
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.171
(engines humming)

707
00:26:12.204 --> 00:26:13.205
(ping)

708
00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:14.974
Oh, God.

709
00:26:15.007 --> 00:26:17.744
Okay. Oh, no.

710
00:26:17.777 --> 00:26:19.011
(seatbelt buckle clicking)

711
00:26:19.045 --> 00:26:21.013
Don't be a baby.

712
00:26:21.047 --> 00:26:22.214
(inhales deeply)

713
00:26:22.248 --> 00:26:23.215
(clears throat)

714
00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:24.617
Please stop.

715
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:26.018
Sorry, I can't.

716
00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:27.687
You're freaking me out,
Joshua.

717
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.155
I don't like flying.

718
00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:31.357
You don't like to fly?

719
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.092
I'm scared of flying!

720
00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:34.226
Then why
did you agree to fly

721
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.028
halfway across
the world with me?

722
00:26:36.062 --> 00:26:37.697
How the hell else was I
supposed to get to Europe?

723
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.265
You never fly?

724
00:26:39.298 --> 00:26:41.333
No, I drink, then I fly!

725
00:26:41.367 --> 00:26:42.769
Then why aren't you
drinking now?

726
00:26:42.802 --> 00:26:44.203
You told me not to!

727
00:26:44.236 --> 00:26:45.705
(woman)
Sir! Please calm down.

728
00:26:45.738 --> 00:26:47.006
We're in the middle
of takeoff!

729
00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:49.041
Sorry!
Oh, God, oh, God...

730
00:26:49.075 --> 00:26:50.843
Don't worry, Joshua,
I have got this.

731
00:26:50.877 --> 00:26:52.311
No, no, I'm fine.

732
00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.312
You are gonna
drink this.

733
00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:54.346
No, I'm not.

734
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.315
Yes, yes.
Just gonna sit here.

735
00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:57.850
I can handle it!
Drink.

736
00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:00.152
Drink it!

737
00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:01.353
Drink--
Damn it, drink it!

738
00:27:01.387 --> 00:27:02.354
I don't want it anymore.

739
00:27:02.388 --> 00:27:03.656
Open your mouth.
No...

740
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.991
No, thank you!
Open your mouth.

741
00:27:05.024 --> 00:27:06.826
Open your mouth!

742
00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:07.827
Gah!

743
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.895
Oh, God!

744
00:27:08.928 --> 00:27:10.396
(retches)
Ohh...

745
00:27:10.429 --> 00:27:12.164
(moans)
I'm sorry!

746
00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:13.900
What have you done?!

747
00:27:13.933 --> 00:27:15.735
Oh, I'm sorry!
(vomiting)

748
00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:17.403
There you go.

749
00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:19.271
It's okay.

750
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:20.973
We're fine.

751
00:27:21.007 --> 00:27:24.076
Are you guys all right?
Do you need anything?

752
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.178
Yeah, what's
your white wine?

753
00:27:26.212 --> 00:27:27.413
Ohh.

754
00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:30.883
**

755
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:58.044
Wow!
This is incredible!

756
00:27:58.077 --> 00:28:00.046
You put the room
in Josh's name?

757
00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:01.380
No wonder you needed me.

758
00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:03.482
Working in the travel industry
has its perks.

759
00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.852
With my brilliant master plan,
I doubled up on discounts

760
00:28:05.885 --> 00:28:07.419
by using
two different names.

761
00:28:07.453 --> 00:28:10.056
Clever...

762
00:28:10.089 --> 00:28:13.025
So, in your grand master plan,
how did this work out?

763
00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:14.193
Well...

764
00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:16.428
the couch looks
perfectly comfortable,

765
00:28:16.462 --> 00:28:18.965
and as long as you don't
take your penis out,
we should be fine.

766
00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:20.366
Whoa,
that's not fair.

767
00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:21.934
I mean, I paid
my half of the trip,

768
00:28:21.968 --> 00:28:24.036
and after all,
the room is in my name.

769
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.105
How's unemployment
in California
this time of year?

770
00:28:26.138 --> 00:28:27.373
I can't believe
you're single.

771
00:28:27.406 --> 00:28:29.141
Just try not
to vomit on anything.

772
00:28:29.175 --> 00:28:31.110
Okay, sure.
I'll take a shower.

773
00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:33.045
I smell like scotch
and bad life choices.

774
00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:34.413
So it does
know how to bathe.

775
00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:36.749
I thought the priority
was surname, not hygiene.

776
00:28:36.783 --> 00:28:37.884
(bag unzipping)
Would both kill you?

777
00:28:37.917 --> 00:28:39.218
A couple days
of this might.

778
00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:41.087
Don't bother unpacking,

779
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.955
we're leaving first thing
in the morning.

780
00:28:42.989 --> 00:28:45.825
And hurry up, we have a tour
of the Hagia Sophia in an hour.

781
00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:47.226
We just got here.

782
00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:48.961
I don't think the museum
is going anywhere.

783
00:28:48.995 --> 00:28:50.797
And wear something
nice for dinner.

784
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.299
Oh, no,
I forgot my tuxedo!

785
00:28:53.332 --> 00:28:54.466
Joshua!

786
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.136
Aw, just give me
five minutes.

787
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:59.906
Hey! There's a little sink
next to the toilet!

788
00:28:59.939 --> 00:29:01.007
That's a...

789
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.842
(water running)
Never mind.

790
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:04.443
(computer beeps)

791
00:29:06.045 --> 00:29:08.514
Oh, my God!
What's up, girl?

792
00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:11.784
Joshua, or as it turns out,
Michael Joshua,

793
00:29:11.818 --> 00:29:13.419
just hopped in the shower,
so I thought I'd get on.

794
00:29:13.452 --> 00:29:16.522
If I were you, I'd hop in there
with him and get off.

795
00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:18.090
Ew. Where's Marcie?

796
00:29:18.124 --> 00:29:20.326
Yo, Enforcer!
Let's park it in here.

797
00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:21.493
Ames is on.

798
00:29:21.527 --> 00:29:23.395
Ugh, don't
rush me woman.

799
00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:25.197
I've been peddling
all day.

800
00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:27.399
I just wanted to check in
with you guys and let you know

801
00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:28.868
that we got
to Istanbul safely.

802
00:29:28.901 --> 00:29:30.202
(Sandra)
Don't you mean Constantinople?

803
00:29:30.236 --> 00:29:32.304
Funny.
How's homeboy
holding up?

804
00:29:32.338 --> 00:29:34.173
After take-off,
he was fine.

805
00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:35.808
Oh, you put him
in line.

806
00:29:35.842 --> 00:29:39.045
I think his fear of flying
did all the work for me.

807
00:29:39.078 --> 00:29:40.947
Wait, who takes on
a tour of Europe

808
00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.148
when they're
afraid to fly?

809
00:29:42.181 --> 00:29:43.883
He's harmless.

810
00:29:43.916 --> 00:29:46.118
A total smartass,
but he'll get the job done.

811
00:29:46.152 --> 00:29:48.287
See, aren't you glad
you went now?

812
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.057
I am.
You should see the view.

813
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.825
It's gorgeous here.

814
00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:54.360
We're having dinner tonight
on the Bosporus,

815
00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:55.962
but first we have a tour
of the Hippodrome,

816
00:29:55.995 --> 00:29:58.497
if Joshua ever gets
out of the bathroom.

817
00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.531
Holy crap.
Amy, move!

818
00:29:59.565 --> 00:30:01.200
Move where?
To the right!

819
00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:02.201
No, our right!

820
00:30:02.234 --> 00:30:03.402
(Sandra)
Ow.

821
00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:04.837
Guys, shut up!

822
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:06.172
Tilt the screen!

823
00:30:06.205 --> 00:30:07.139
Who are you talking to?
Nobody!

824
00:30:08.274 --> 00:30:11.343
Hi, Sandra.
Hi, Marcie.

825
00:30:11.377 --> 00:30:13.079
Hi.
Hi.

826
00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:15.414
See? Everybody
made it here safely.

827
00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:17.917
And even though this beautiful
hotel room is in my name,

828
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.219
apparently I'm on the couch
tonight... satisfied?

829
00:30:20.252 --> 00:30:21.387
Hell, yeah.

830
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.454
I'd like to see him
on my couch.

831
00:30:22.488 --> 00:30:24.156
Mm-hmm.
(growls)

832
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.558
All right, I'm gonna go
put some actual clothes on

833
00:30:26.592 --> 00:30:28.627
for dinner,
and then I'm all yours.

834
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.262
Uh-huh.

835
00:30:30.296 --> 00:30:32.264
Perfect.

836
00:30:32.298 --> 00:30:33.565
I mean, yeah.

837
00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:35.634
Great.
Bye, ladies.

838
00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:36.635
Uh...

839
00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.204
Bye.
Bye.

840
00:30:38.237 --> 00:30:39.571
What?

841
00:30:39.605 --> 00:30:41.874
Bon appétit.

842
00:30:41.908 --> 00:30:42.875
(growls)

843
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:45.211
**

844
00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:46.578
Hurry up!
Hey, look!

845
00:30:46.612 --> 00:30:48.347
You can almost see
the obelisks through the trees.

846
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.282
We have dinner reservations.

847
00:30:50.316 --> 00:30:52.251
You realize we've passed,
like, three national landmarks.

848
00:30:52.284 --> 00:30:53.652
I have a plan, Joshua.

849
00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:55.387
Does your plan actually
include enjoying the trip?

850
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:56.956
Almost there.

851
00:30:59.325 --> 00:31:01.493
(Amy)
Merit, party of two at 7:00.

852
00:31:01.527 --> 00:31:03.629
(Joshua)
Or try "Neurotic," party of one.

853
00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:05.031
(Amy)
Shut up, Joshua.

854
00:31:14.974 --> 00:31:17.977
Is this okay, Josh?

855
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.445
Or did you wanna
go back downstairs

856
00:31:19.478 --> 00:31:21.013
for your partial view?

857
00:31:21.047 --> 00:31:22.581
Couldn't have found
anything nicer?

858
00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:24.383
Apology accepted.

859
00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:26.252
(chuckling)
I don't even wanna eat.

860
00:31:26.285 --> 00:31:27.653
I just wanna
look at everything.

861
00:31:29.121 --> 00:31:30.622
Can I get you
anything to drink?

862
00:31:30.656 --> 00:31:32.691
Uh, you'll have to ask her
if we're allowed to drink.

863
00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.526
(chuckling)
Hush!

864
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.695
Do you have a local
Narinje from 2011?

865
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:39.598
Wow, you've already pre-planned
the wine we're drinking?

866
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:40.967
Do you have
a better idea?

867
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.971
Uh, yeah.
Let's ask the real experts.

868
00:31:45.004 --> 00:31:46.538
(speaking Turkish)

869
00:31:46.572 --> 00:31:50.042
(speaking Turkish)

870
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:03.289
What?

871
00:32:03.322 --> 00:32:04.991
You speak Turkish?

872
00:32:05.024 --> 00:32:06.258
Yeah.

873
00:32:06.292 --> 00:32:08.094
Says on my profile I speak
several languages.

874
00:32:08.127 --> 00:32:09.495
There's no way.

875
00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:10.562
I would've
noticed that.

876
00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:12.131
Give me your phone.

877
00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:13.599
I'll prove it.

878
00:32:13.632 --> 00:32:16.435
If I'm wrong,
I'll buy your dinner.

879
00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:18.337
And if you're right?

880
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.006
I get the bed.

881
00:32:24.243 --> 00:32:26.512
Mind if I log in
on here?

882
00:32:26.545 --> 00:32:28.614
You're really gonna
rub this in, aren't you?

883
00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:29.748
Only until we
get back to America

884
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.150
and never speak
to each other again.

885
00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:33.485
(phone chimes)
There.

886
00:32:36.022 --> 00:32:37.389
St. Cloud University,

887
00:32:37.423 --> 00:32:39.992
"Bachelor Studies
in Altaic Languages."

888
00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:42.494
Altaic? Italic?

889
00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:43.762
That doesn't sound
like a real thing.

890
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.397
You sound like my father.

891
00:32:45.431 --> 00:32:47.633
"Speaks English,
Latin, German,

892
00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:49.268
Turkish, Korean,
and Japanese"?

893
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:50.702
What are you,
in the CIA?

894
00:32:50.736 --> 00:32:52.704
I could tell you,
but I'd have to sleep with you.

895
00:32:52.738 --> 00:32:54.406
Yeah, well,
just remember, 007,

896
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.575
you only have a license
to sleep on the couch.

897
00:32:56.608 --> 00:32:58.544
Not tonight.
I won the bet.

898
00:32:58.577 --> 00:33:00.646
We never shook on it,
and this info's
set to private.

899
00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:02.214
(chuckling)
Are you serious?

900
00:33:02.248 --> 00:33:03.782
I think my students
are less sore losers than you.

901
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:05.317
(phone chimes)
You have
a friend request.

902
00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:08.254
Sandra Laser.

903
00:33:08.287 --> 00:33:09.255
Who's that?

904
00:33:09.288 --> 00:33:10.722
Oh, no.

905
00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:12.258
Wait, is that
your Sandra?

906
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:14.193
You don't have
to confirm her.

907
00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:15.561
Oh, yes I do.

908
00:33:15.594 --> 00:33:17.463
This is too good.
Gimme...

909
00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:19.265
Does she have pictures
of you on here?
Joshua!

910
00:33:19.298 --> 00:33:21.767
I think I did more research
on you than you did on me.

911
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.669
Please, you don't know
anything about me.

912
00:33:23.702 --> 00:33:25.504
Amy Elizabeth Tyler.

913
00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:27.506
Smart girl,
graduated from Stanford

914
00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:30.576
before starting a very popular
travel blog called

915
00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:32.444
"Amy's Adventures."
I'm Amy...

916
00:33:32.478 --> 00:33:34.546
Your blog went viral,
and you now do something

917
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.682
involving social media
and travel.

918
00:33:36.715 --> 00:33:40.252
Well, I know your
blood type's O positive.

919
00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:43.689
Wow... creepiness
notwithstanding,

920
00:33:43.722 --> 00:33:46.658
I can't believe you
actually invited a stranger
on your vacation.

921
00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:52.664
Enjoy.

922
00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:53.765
(speaking Turkish)

923
00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:58.637
This table
was the first thing
I booked.

924
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.239
By the time
the food comes,

925
00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:01.540
the sun will have set,

926
00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:03.775
and the entire city
will light up...

927
00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:07.079
and it's going
to be perfect.

928
00:34:07.113 --> 00:34:09.148
Almost perfect.

929
00:34:09.181 --> 00:34:11.150
This trip is really
different than I planned,

930
00:34:11.183 --> 00:34:12.551
and that's hard
to get used to,

931
00:34:12.584 --> 00:34:15.254
but I wasn't gonna
give this up for anything.

932
00:34:15.287 --> 00:34:16.788
Or anyone.

933
00:34:16.822 --> 00:34:19.391
Well, my namesake missed out
on something really special.

934
00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:23.395
To new adventures.

935
00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:27.399
To new adventures.

936
00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:33.705
Can't we just
get ice cream?

937
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.107
I have something
special planned.

938
00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:36.475
Is it hiding
a dead body?

939
00:34:36.508 --> 00:34:37.709
'Cause I think
I found a place.

940
00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:39.245
Trust me.
I do this for a living.

941
00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.646
Yeah, I still
don't get what you do.

942
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.348
You're like a fancy
travel agent, right?

943
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:44.583
I'm not a travel agent,
I'm a global concierge.

944
00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:46.518
Nah, that doesn't sound
like a real thing.

945
00:34:46.552 --> 00:34:48.720
Okay, most millennials
take nine trips a year.

946
00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:50.722
I'm sorry, nine?
Did you say nine?

947
00:34:50.756 --> 00:34:52.358
Consulting,
research, trades.

948
00:34:52.391 --> 00:34:53.759
I should've never
become a teacher.

949
00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:55.161
But you have
your summers, right?

950
00:34:55.194 --> 00:34:56.528
Not to take nine trips!

951
00:34:56.562 --> 00:34:58.664
You're thinking of travel
as an expense

952
00:34:58.697 --> 00:35:00.332
rather than
a simple upgrade.

953
00:35:00.366 --> 00:35:02.201
When our clients get sent
somewhere for work,

954
00:35:02.234 --> 00:35:04.536
we help them maximize
their trip for play.

955
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.439
Yeah, your clients work
much cooler places than I do.

956
00:35:07.473 --> 00:35:09.341
Well, hypothetically,

957
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:10.642
let's say
your work sends you

958
00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:12.344
to a teaching conference
in Austin.

959
00:35:12.378 --> 00:35:14.346
Okay, yeah.
Austin is not Istanbul.

960
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.914
They have teaching conferences
in Istanbul.

961
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.517
Let's stick to hypothetical
Austin for now.

962
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.651
Great.

963
00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:20.852
Having never
been to Texas,

964
00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:22.554
you decide to stay
an extra day,

965
00:35:22.588 --> 00:35:24.856
so you can see more than
the inside of a hotel room.

966
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.759
Trip's already paid for.
You have the sick days
saved up.

967
00:35:27.793 --> 00:35:30.562
And for a small fee,
I can unlock the city

968
00:35:30.596 --> 00:35:32.498
so that you see more
in 24 hours

969
00:35:32.531 --> 00:35:34.733
than most tourists
or locals see in a month,

970
00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:36.535
all tailored
to your tastes.

971
00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:38.770
I'm pretty sure I'd still
find some cool stuff.

972
00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:40.206
We're here.

973
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.411
(bell jingles)

974
00:35:45.444 --> 00:35:47.579
Hi, I tweeted you about--

975
00:35:47.613 --> 00:35:49.481
Ah!
Of course, of course!

976
00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:50.582
Come, come!

977
00:35:50.616 --> 00:35:51.717
Where do you find
these places?

978
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:52.751
Instagram.

979
00:35:52.784 --> 00:35:54.486
(laughs)

980
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.588
You're not joking...

981
00:35:56.622 --> 00:35:58.890
I'm finishing
the first batch
of the day.

982
00:35:58.924 --> 00:36:00.192
You wanna see?

983
00:36:00.226 --> 00:36:01.393
Yes, please.

984
00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:07.533
Perfect!

985
00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:08.800
See?

986
00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:09.901
See what?

987
00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:11.403
You watch.

988
00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:21.813
Gold leaf.

989
00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:25.517
Anise.

990
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.289
Your turn.

991
00:36:30.322 --> 00:36:31.857
(chuckles)

992
00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:35.927
So...

993
00:36:35.961 --> 00:36:38.264
Instagram, huh?

994
00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:40.766
I can search the hashtag,
"Istanbul Bakery."

995
00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:42.901
Sort through photos
that are often geo-tagged,

996
00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.470
find directions
to the actual bakery,

997
00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:45.937
and voila!

998
00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:47.906
A local delicacy
made fresh.

999
00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.641
You came up
with all this?

1000
00:36:49.675 --> 00:36:51.410
Just the impressive part.

1001
00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:53.645
Why is it people like you
always work for smart start-ups

1002
00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:56.782
instead of solving
the debt crisis or world hunger?

1003
00:36:56.815 --> 00:37:00.218
Taste this and tell me
I'm wasting my talents.

1004
00:37:01.487 --> 00:37:02.454
(crunch)

1005
00:37:02.488 --> 00:37:04.890
Mmm!

1006
00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:06.458
Okay.

1007
00:37:06.492 --> 00:37:08.026
Yeah.
Trip's over.

1008
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.295
I live here now.

1009
00:37:09.328 --> 00:37:10.496
(chuckling)

1010
00:37:10.529 --> 00:37:15.501
So... travel agent
or global concierge?

1011
00:37:15.534 --> 00:37:17.669
Global concierge.

1012
00:37:17.703 --> 00:37:19.638
My turn.

1013
00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:22.941
So, Esra, what's
the secret ingredient?

1014
00:37:24.676 --> 00:37:26.312
(glasses clinking)

1015
00:37:26.345 --> 00:37:27.313
Raki.

1016
00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:29.448
What is that?

1017
00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:34.353
That... is their version
of moonshine.

1018
00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:36.455
(chuckling)

1019
00:37:36.488 --> 00:37:39.425
**

1020
00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:47.533
(Amy)
Hurry up!

1021
00:37:47.566 --> 00:37:49.601
Wow...
tipsy Amy walks slower,

1022
00:37:49.635 --> 00:37:51.437
but she still keeps
a tight schedule.

1023
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.904
We have to rest up
for tomorrow!

1024
00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:54.440
Hurry up and relax, huh?

1025
00:37:54.473 --> 00:37:55.841
There's a lot to see.

1026
00:37:55.874 --> 00:37:57.776
I just don't wanna
miss anything.

1027
00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.312
Oh, yeah? Why'd you stop
vlogging about it?

1028
00:38:00.346 --> 00:38:02.013
Do you know how many views
you have to get

1029
00:38:02.047 --> 00:38:03.482
for your videos
to make money?

1030
00:38:03.515 --> 00:38:05.451
Yeah.
That's why I teach.

1031
00:38:05.484 --> 00:38:07.653
I hate children, but
I make so much money

1032
00:38:07.686 --> 00:38:09.455
off the little bastards.

1033
00:38:09.488 --> 00:38:11.657
When I was a kid,
I wanted to live

1034
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.025
out of a suitcase
and travel the world.

1035
00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:16.795
And I did.
It was great.

1036
00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:19.598
But the vacation always
has to come to an end.

1037
00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:22.401
Hey. Says who?

1038
00:38:22.434 --> 00:38:24.570
Said my bank account

1039
00:38:24.603 --> 00:38:26.705
and my parents
and my friends

1040
00:38:26.738 --> 00:38:28.574
and my perfect boyfriend

1041
00:38:28.607 --> 00:38:30.876
who didn't want
a long distance relationship.

1042
00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:32.678
Hey... he dumped you.

1043
00:38:32.711 --> 00:38:34.513
Clearly,
he wasn't that perfect.

1044
00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:36.748
Our life was.

1045
00:38:36.782 --> 00:38:38.950
I finally had security.

1046
00:38:38.984 --> 00:38:40.686
I created a way
to help people

1047
00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:45.391
see the world through my eyes,
and it's a good idea.

1048
00:38:45.424 --> 00:38:48.394
I'm making
travel smarter, safer.

1049
00:38:48.427 --> 00:38:51.563
I reconnected with old friends
like Sandra and Marcie.

1050
00:38:51.597 --> 00:38:52.564
I got rid of my debt.

1051
00:38:52.598 --> 00:38:53.999
And your dreams.

1052
00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:57.369
Josh became my dream.

1053
00:38:57.403 --> 00:38:59.671
All I had to do
is give up my old life

1054
00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:03.675
and my little videos.

1055
00:39:03.709 --> 00:39:05.577
I started
a new kind of journey

1056
00:39:05.611 --> 00:39:09.515
where I planned adventures for
other people instead of myself.

1057
00:39:09.548 --> 00:39:13.552
It was like a vacation
all over again, but...

1058
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.355
The vacation
came to an end.

1059
00:39:25.497 --> 00:39:28.066
Hey, you could
still make your videos
on the side, you know.

1060
00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:31.102
Yeah... maybe
I'll vlog about tonight.

1061
00:39:31.136 --> 00:39:33.739
First I'm on the couch,
now we're making videos.

1062
00:39:33.772 --> 00:39:35.874
What was in that Raki?

1063
00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:37.909
Shut up, you...

1064
00:39:37.943 --> 00:39:42.147
with the muscles
and the wine stuff.

1065
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.817
And the multi-lingual...

1066
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:47.486
lingual-ness?

1067
00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:49.455
Stanford, huh?

1068
00:39:49.488 --> 00:39:52.524
Shut your face.

1069
00:39:52.558 --> 00:39:54.793
All right, drunkie.
Let's get you to bed.

1070
00:39:54.826 --> 00:39:56.127
We have to drive
in the morning.

1071
00:39:56.161 --> 00:39:59.064
I know.

1072
00:39:59.097 --> 00:40:01.967
We have to get up
so early.

1073
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.135
Yeah.
Whose idea was that?

1074
00:40:04.169 --> 00:40:05.437
Hey!

1075
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:06.805
You should be grateful

1076
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:09.074
I'm squeezing the most
out of this trip.

1077
00:40:09.107 --> 00:40:11.610
I'm glad that we flew
12 hours to Istanbul

1078
00:40:11.643 --> 00:40:13.445
just to drive out of it
the next day.

1079
00:40:13.479 --> 00:40:16.081
Hush, grumpy pants.

1080
00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:19.184
With me, you saw
more in 24 hours

1081
00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:22.488
than you ever would have
seen in your life.

1082
00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:24.623
(chuckling)
I will give you that.

1083
00:40:24.656 --> 00:40:25.624
Come on.

1084
00:40:25.657 --> 00:40:26.992
(grunts)

1085
00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:28.059
Whee!

1086
00:40:28.093 --> 00:40:29.160
(faint traffic noise)

1087
00:40:29.194 --> 00:40:31.763
(Amy grunts)

1088
00:40:31.797 --> 00:40:33.064
Ohh.

1089
00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:36.635
Wait, you won the bed.

1090
00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:37.803
Stay here.

1091
00:40:37.836 --> 00:40:39.070
No way.

1092
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:40.238
I'm not missing
my only opportunity

1093
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.673
to couch surf the world.

1094
00:40:41.707 --> 00:40:43.074
Don't go.

1095
00:40:43.108 --> 00:40:44.676
Stay with me.

1096
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.513
That's really
not a good idea.

1097
00:40:47.546 --> 00:40:49.114
But I want you to.

1098
00:40:50.749 --> 00:40:53.184
Kiss me, Josh.

1099
00:40:53.218 --> 00:40:55.020
Please, Josh.

1100
00:40:57.556 --> 00:40:59.224
I'm not Josh.

1101
00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:01.192
Don't leave me.

1102
00:41:01.226 --> 00:41:03.094
My name is Joshua,
not Josh.

1103
00:41:03.128 --> 00:41:05.030
I'm not your boyfriend.

1104
00:41:05.063 --> 00:41:06.197
I'm not your rebound.

1105
00:41:06.231 --> 00:41:07.833
And I certainly
didn't come here

1106
00:41:07.866 --> 00:41:12.638
to be told what to do
every second of every day.

1107
00:41:20.579 --> 00:41:22.848
(sighs)

1108
00:41:25.617 --> 00:41:27.118
Good night, Amy.

1109
00:41:33.258 --> 00:41:36.728
I can't wait to see what
you've got planned tomorrow.

1110
00:41:38.163 --> 00:41:39.598
**

1111
00:41:39.631 --> 00:41:40.899
(Joshua)
Oh, okay, okay.

1112
00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:42.300
Please slow down.

1113
00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.269
I didn't realize
you also got carsick.

1114
00:41:44.302 --> 00:41:46.004
Didn't you read the travel
itinerary I sent you?

1115
00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:47.773
I didn't realize I'd be
riding with Danica Patrick.

1116
00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:50.008
We're late.
Rather be late than dead.

1117
00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:51.710
What are you doing?

1118
00:41:51.743 --> 00:41:53.945
I'm just rolling down the window
to get some fresh air.

1119
00:41:53.979 --> 00:41:55.581
You're supposed
to be navigating.

1120
00:41:55.614 --> 00:41:56.682
Where are the directions?
Will you calm down?

1121
00:41:56.715 --> 00:41:58.784
The directions
are right here.

1122
00:41:58.817 --> 00:42:00.185
Joshua!
Huh?

1123
00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:01.853
What's next?
Uh...

1124
00:42:01.887 --> 00:42:03.221
I think take
the next right.

1125
00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:05.123
You think? What do
the directions say?

1126
00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:06.558
They said right.

1127
00:42:06.592 --> 00:42:07.926
Let me see.
Y-You drive.

1128
00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:09.761
I got this.
Hand it to me!

1129
00:42:09.795 --> 00:42:11.797
Look, maybe we should
just scrap the directions.

1130
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.099
You know, throw 'em
out the window.

1131
00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:15.266
You threw them
out the window.

1132
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.768
They may have flown
out the window.

1133
00:42:16.802 --> 00:42:18.870
That was our only copy!

1134
00:42:18.904 --> 00:42:20.872
I'm surprised of all people
you don't have a backup plan.

1135
00:42:20.906 --> 00:42:22.007
(sighs)

1136
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.174
You're impossible.
Here.

1137
00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:24.610
Whoa, what--
What are you doing?

1138
00:42:24.643 --> 00:42:26.077
No texting!

1139
00:42:26.111 --> 00:42:27.746
I am going to use the GPS
to navigate myself!

1140
00:42:27.779 --> 00:42:29.815
Let me do it.
You've done enough!

1141
00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:31.216
Just... watch the road!

1142
00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:32.918
(tires screech)

1143
00:42:32.951 --> 00:42:34.720
(distant dog barking)

1144
00:42:34.753 --> 00:42:36.655
Your e-mail promised
a vacation,

1145
00:42:36.688 --> 00:42:38.957
not an episode
of "The Amazing Race."

1146
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.992
I took the time
to write out the plan

1147
00:42:41.026 --> 00:42:43.762
step-by-step, and you
threw it out the window!

1148
00:42:43.795 --> 00:42:44.963
I'm sorry, what?

1149
00:42:44.996 --> 00:42:47.899
You wanna go back
and look for it?

1150
00:42:47.933 --> 00:42:49.668
**

1151
00:42:49.701 --> 00:42:51.236
Little help?

1152
00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:53.238
I'm helping
look for a signal.

1153
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:54.906
Yeah, I got
a signal for ya.

1154
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.808
If I can just
figure out where we are,

1155
00:42:56.842 --> 00:42:58.677
I can get us
back on schedule.

1156
00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.378
Well, you wanted lunch
in the countryside.

1157
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:01.913
Looks like we're
right on schedule.

1158
00:43:01.947 --> 00:43:04.149
I had an itinerary.

1159
00:43:04.182 --> 00:43:06.618
I spent time and money
and a lot of work to get here.

1160
00:43:06.652 --> 00:43:08.386
Can I be inside the car
for this conversation?

1161
00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:10.121
I wanted to see
the countryside

1162
00:43:10.155 --> 00:43:13.124
and drink local wine
and eat handmade chocolate.

1163
00:43:13.158 --> 00:43:15.093
You know, I'm sure they have
all those things in every town.

1164
00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:16.261
You can't just
swap everything

1165
00:43:16.294 --> 00:43:17.729
as if it
doesn't matter!

1166
00:43:17.763 --> 00:43:19.130
This is important
to me!

1167
00:43:19.164 --> 00:43:20.932
Look, lady, I'm just trying
to go with the flow.

1168
00:43:20.966 --> 00:43:23.869
I wanted to go with the plan,
not the flow.

1169
00:43:23.902 --> 00:43:25.937
I wanted to drink Nairinjay,
not Chardonnay.

1170
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:27.806
And I wanted to be here
with Josh and not you!

1171
00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.641
Well, I didn't
choose you, either, lady.

1172
00:43:29.675 --> 00:43:31.342
If you're so good at planning,
how'd you get to Europe

1173
00:43:31.376 --> 00:43:33.779
with only half the people
you planned to take?

1174
00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:34.980
(revs engine)

1175
00:43:35.013 --> 00:43:36.381
Whoa!
What are you--

1176
00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:37.816
What are you doing?
Wait!

1177
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:39.317
I'll be
at the coffee place!

1178
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.853
Amy! Wait! Wait!

1179
00:43:43.388 --> 00:43:45.724
Oh, great.
The coffee place.

1180
00:43:45.757 --> 00:43:47.325
You know, the one in Turkey.

1181
00:43:50.929 --> 00:43:52.430
I'll just walk
to the coffee place

1182
00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.365
in the town that I've
never been to.

1183
00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:56.334
(indistinct chatter)

1184
00:44:00.839 --> 00:44:02.708
Well!
The good news is

1185
00:44:02.741 --> 00:44:04.976
there's only seven
coffee places
in this town.

1186
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.678
Don't start.

1187
00:44:08.246 --> 00:44:10.916
Hey, I'm just glad you
didn't do this in Istanbul.

1188
00:44:10.949 --> 00:44:12.350
Got the itinerary.

1189
00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.685
We've already
missed the tour,

1190
00:44:13.719 --> 00:44:15.220
but we can still
make the museum

1191
00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:16.321
and the hot springs
if we push dinner.

1192
00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:17.455
May I?

1193
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:18.757
(crunching)

1194
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:20.191
I don't wanna be here.

1195
00:44:20.225 --> 00:44:22.393
Are you kidding me?

1196
00:44:22.427 --> 00:44:23.762
Look around you.

1197
00:44:23.795 --> 00:44:25.363
Who wouldn't
want to be here?

1198
00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:26.898
Me.
Listen...

1199
00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:29.167
Amy, we may not agree
on many things,

1200
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.336
but we both know you planned
one hell of a vacation.

1201
00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:33.839
You said it yourself.

1202
00:44:33.872 --> 00:44:34.906
I planned half of this trip
for somebody else,

1203
00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.708
and he's not even here.

1204
00:44:36.742 --> 00:44:39.244
So now you don't have to worry
about anyone but yourself.

1205
00:44:39.277 --> 00:44:42.914
(laughing)
How often in life
do we get to say that?

1206
00:44:42.948 --> 00:44:46.718
I miss him so much,
Joshua.

1207
00:44:46.752 --> 00:44:49.387
I know this trip
isn't what you planned.

1208
00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.356
Hell, I'm the last person
who expected to be

1209
00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:53.258
on the other side
of the world right now.

1210
00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:56.361
But it sure beats sitting
at home sulking over my job,

1211
00:44:56.394 --> 00:44:58.363
my love life...

1212
00:44:58.396 --> 00:45:01.366
everything else that's waiting
for me when I get back there.

1213
00:45:01.399 --> 00:45:04.069
You don't wanna
go back home, either?

1214
00:45:04.102 --> 00:45:05.136
Hell, no.

1215
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.072
I, for one,
will never be able

1216
00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:08.506
to afford a trip
like this again.

1217
00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.208
Unless some weirdo
on the Internet finds me.

1218
00:45:10.241 --> 00:45:11.943
It's not that weird!

1219
00:45:11.977 --> 00:45:14.846
It's the weirdest thing
that's ever happened to me.

1220
00:45:16.915 --> 00:45:18.216
Here.

1221
00:45:18.249 --> 00:45:20.051
What is that?

1222
00:45:20.085 --> 00:45:22.453
Literally
an olive branch.

1223
00:45:22.487 --> 00:45:24.055
You're a dork.

1224
00:45:24.089 --> 00:45:25.123
You picked me.

1225
00:45:27.993 --> 00:45:29.060
Come on.

1226
00:45:29.094 --> 00:45:30.128
Hey!

1227
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.069
Amy, tell the people
at home what you see.

1228
00:45:38.103 --> 00:45:39.304
Stop.

1229
00:45:39.337 --> 00:45:40.939
This week on
"Amy's Adventures,"

1230
00:45:40.972 --> 00:45:42.908
we take you to Bademli,

1231
00:45:42.941 --> 00:45:44.475
a small town which
translates to "almond,"

1232
00:45:44.509 --> 00:45:46.812
which is actually known
for its Aegean olive fields

1233
00:45:46.845 --> 00:45:48.179
that we spent the morning
whizzing through.

1234
00:45:48.213 --> 00:45:50.849
How do you know that?
I'm a very smart man.

1235
00:45:50.882 --> 00:45:52.851
You found
the tourism office.

1236
00:45:52.884 --> 00:45:54.385
I may have found
the tourism office,

1237
00:45:54.419 --> 00:45:55.921
but I think that
was a very smart way

1238
00:45:55.954 --> 00:45:58.123
to find all
the coffee places in town.

1239
00:45:58.156 --> 00:46:01.159
The other thing Bademli
is known for is...

1240
00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:04.495
(crowd chattering)

1241
00:46:04.529 --> 00:46:06.164
(Joshua speaking Turkish)

1242
00:46:06.197 --> 00:46:07.165
Ben Joshua.

1243
00:46:07.198 --> 00:46:08.466
Neslihan.

1244
00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.168
(speaking Turkish)

1245
00:46:11.536 --> 00:46:13.138
(speaking Turkish)

1246
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:15.974
Uh, it's a, uh, bracelet
made with blue chalcedony,

1247
00:46:16.007 --> 00:46:18.810
which is a local quartz
with... mythical powers.

1248
00:46:18.844 --> 00:46:20.045
What does it do?

1249
00:46:20.078 --> 00:46:21.847
Absorbs negativity.

1250
00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.981
Is it working?

1251
00:46:23.014 --> 00:46:24.149
Jerk.

1252
00:46:24.182 --> 00:46:25.150
Pick one.

1253
00:46:25.183 --> 00:46:26.451
No, I couldn't.

1254
00:46:26.484 --> 00:46:28.854
Come on, you're
insulting Neslihan.

1255
00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:32.423
(Joshua chuckling)

1256
00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:33.992
(speaking Turkish)

1257
00:46:37.395 --> 00:46:38.930
Help?
Ah.

1258
00:46:43.368 --> 00:46:45.403
Why are you
being so nice to me?

1259
00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:48.239
I'm only a jerk to people
who take me to Hawaii.

1260
00:46:48.273 --> 00:46:50.341
No one's ever bought me
jewelry before.

1261
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:55.013
Well, your ex's
shortcomings aside,
now you can tell people

1262
00:46:55.046 --> 00:46:56.381
about how you
and a complete stranger

1263
00:46:56.414 --> 00:46:58.283
found this adorable
little market,

1264
00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:00.919
and he bought you
a one-of-a-kind
handmade bracelet.

1265
00:47:00.952 --> 00:47:03.221
You think you can just
buy me a bracelet

1266
00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:04.355
and I won't be
upset anymore?

1267
00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:06.424
Is it working?

1268
00:47:06.457 --> 00:47:10.561
Listen, Amy, this trip is not
gonna be what you expected.

1269
00:47:10.595 --> 00:47:13.564
But I'll bet,
if you let it...

1270
00:47:13.598 --> 00:47:15.400
it can be even better.

1271
00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:19.370
So, what's the plan?

1272
00:47:19.404 --> 00:47:21.072
We make it up.

1273
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.609
**

1274
00:48:10.956 --> 00:48:12.423
(blows)

1275
00:49:12.183 --> 00:49:14.285
Hold the boat!
Hurry up, Joshua!

1276
00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.286
We're gonna
miss the ferry!

1277
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.988
Amy, will you calm down?

1278
00:49:17.022 --> 00:49:19.357
Heaven forbid we spend more
than an hour in one location.

1279
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.159
This is the last ferry
today, Joshua.

1280
00:49:21.192 --> 00:49:22.593
Unless you'd
prefer to fly!

1281
00:49:22.627 --> 00:49:24.529
(bell clanging)

1282
00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:26.297
Hold the boat!

1283
00:49:26.331 --> 00:49:27.732
**

1284
00:49:27.765 --> 00:49:29.467
We're gonna make it.
We're not gonna make it.

1285
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.369
We can jump for it.
I'm sorry, what?

1286
00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:32.737
**

1287
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.072
Come on, Joshua!

1288
00:49:34.105 --> 00:49:36.307
You're insane!
Here... we...

1289
00:49:36.341 --> 00:49:40.611
goooooo!

1290
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:49.254
(Amy)
Oh! Oh, my God!

1291
00:49:49.287 --> 00:49:51.422
(Joshua laughing)
Hey! Just wait!

1292
00:49:51.456 --> 00:49:54.025
That was incredible!

1293
00:49:54.059 --> 00:49:55.360
You see, Joshua!

1294
00:49:55.393 --> 00:49:57.195
The rest of the world
follows a schedule!

1295
00:49:57.228 --> 00:49:58.463
You worry too much.

1296
00:49:58.496 --> 00:50:00.398
Says the guy with
the soaking wet backpack.

1297
00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:02.267
Ah, a little water
never hurt anyone.

1298
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.568
You got a phone
in there, right?

1299
00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:05.103
Oh, crap!

1300
00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:07.072
I would suggest
a hard-shelled,

1301
00:50:07.105 --> 00:50:08.373
waterproof rolling bag,

1302
00:50:08.406 --> 00:50:10.741
but I don't wanna
micromanage.

1303
00:50:10.775 --> 00:50:12.710
(man)
You crazy Americans.

1304
00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:15.346
You need a hand,
my friends?

1305
00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.681
Yes, please!

1306
00:50:16.714 --> 00:50:18.083
Oh, don't worry.

1307
00:50:18.116 --> 00:50:20.051
I'll, uh, just
get all the luggage.

1308
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.521
(man grunting)

1309
00:50:28.493 --> 00:50:31.462
I fished a siren
out of the sea.

1310
00:50:31.496 --> 00:50:32.563
Thank you.

1311
00:50:32.597 --> 00:50:34.099
I'm not a very strong
swimmer.

1312
00:50:34.132 --> 00:50:36.234
Good swimmers
are often drowned.

1313
00:50:36.267 --> 00:50:37.235
I'm Amy.

1314
00:50:37.268 --> 00:50:38.469
I'm Kashif.

1315
00:50:38.503 --> 00:50:40.605
Don't worry!
I'm fine.

1316
00:50:40.638 --> 00:50:43.308
This is incredible!

1317
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:45.143
How can we ever
repay you?

1318
00:50:45.176 --> 00:50:47.212
Why, a kiss, of course.

1319
00:50:47.245 --> 00:50:48.679
Oh...

1320
00:50:48.713 --> 00:50:50.715
That's really more
of a figure of speech.

1321
00:50:50.748 --> 00:50:52.783
(grunting)

1322
00:50:52.817 --> 00:50:54.852
A kiss from a face

1323
00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.155
that launched
my single ship.

1324
00:50:58.723 --> 00:51:00.258
(chuckling)

1325
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:01.592
Don't I get a kiss?

1326
00:51:01.626 --> 00:51:04.562
Ah... one is not
enough for two.

1327
00:51:04.595 --> 00:51:06.264
What did you do?

1328
00:51:06.297 --> 00:51:08.799
I nearly drowned fishing
your luggage out of the sea?

1329
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.635
Kashif, is there
a place where we could

1330
00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:12.170
get out of these
wet clothes?

1331
00:51:12.203 --> 00:51:14.472
What man can deny
such an honor?

1332
00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:15.806
Please.

1333
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.708
Help yourself
below deck.

1334
00:51:17.742 --> 00:51:19.177
Thank you.

1335
00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:20.178
I'm fine.

1336
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:21.212
(Kashif grunts)

1337
00:51:22.847 --> 00:51:26.617
Ah, the things
we do for love, no?

1338
00:51:26.651 --> 00:51:28.753
Who says I wasn't jumping
to get away from her?

1339
00:51:28.786 --> 00:51:32.190
Listen, if a woman makes you
want to jump in the ocean,

1340
00:51:32.223 --> 00:51:33.424
you're in love.

1341
00:51:33.458 --> 00:51:35.260
(scoffs)
I'll keep that in mind.

1342
00:51:35.293 --> 00:51:36.727
Where were you headed?

1343
00:51:36.761 --> 00:51:38.496
To Datça.

1344
00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:40.298
You have good taste.

1345
00:51:40.331 --> 00:51:41.366
The lady picked it.

1346
00:51:41.399 --> 00:51:43.368
Again,
you have good taste.

1347
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:45.136
Wait...

1348
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.504
You have a boat.

1349
00:51:46.537 --> 00:51:47.905
You could take us there.

1350
00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.374
It's not my yacht.

1351
00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:51.209
I chartered it
for the owner.

1352
00:51:51.242 --> 00:51:52.810
And, no offense,

1353
00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.212
I don't think
you can afford it.

1354
00:51:54.245 --> 00:51:56.314
You don't know
anything about me.

1355
00:51:56.347 --> 00:51:57.382
I know I don't
fish millionaires

1356
00:51:57.415 --> 00:51:59.217
out of the sea
every day.

1357
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.818
Tell you what.

1358
00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:03.154
You get us to Datça,

1359
00:52:03.188 --> 00:52:04.822
you can tell me
anywhere in the world

1360
00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:05.923
you want to take
a vacation.

1361
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.458
How are you
gonna do that?

1362
00:52:07.492 --> 00:52:08.559
I can't.

1363
00:52:08.593 --> 00:52:10.228
But she can.

1364
00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.531
Huh.

1365
00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:16.667
Welcome aboard.

1366
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:18.536
**

1367
00:52:23.608 --> 00:52:25.543
(seagulls calling)

1368
00:52:27.445 --> 00:52:30.848
**

1369
00:52:37.422 --> 00:52:38.723
Oh! Whoa.

1370
00:52:38.756 --> 00:52:41.192
Not ready to go
in the water again.

1371
00:52:41.226 --> 00:52:43.394
"Oh, look at me.
I'm Joshua.

1372
00:52:43.428 --> 00:52:45.396
"I'm super-manly
and reckless.

1373
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:48.299
"Except on planes.
And cars.

1374
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:49.700
And boats."

1375
00:52:49.734 --> 00:52:51.836
Who are you, and what'd
you do with Amy?

1376
00:52:51.869 --> 00:52:54.672
Being out here
makes me feel like "Old Amy."

1377
00:52:54.705 --> 00:52:56.941
Well, I like Old Amy.

1378
00:52:56.974 --> 00:52:59.444
Gorgeous dresses.

1379
00:52:59.477 --> 00:53:00.811
Jumping off docks.

1380
00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:02.447
Kissing strange men.

1381
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.450
Well, how else are we
supposed to pay Kashif back

1382
00:53:05.483 --> 00:53:07.785
for welcoming us
on this beautiful yacht?

1383
00:53:07.818 --> 00:53:09.754
I told him you'd cover his
travel anywhere in the world.

1384
00:53:09.787 --> 00:53:11.422
You what?
Amy's back.

1385
00:53:11.456 --> 00:53:13.258
Seriously, Joshua?

1386
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:14.992
Just when I think
you've actually gone
and made a real plan,

1387
00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.627
it turns out you expect me
to take care of everything
all over again.

1388
00:53:16.661 --> 00:53:17.962
Hey, Kashif!

1389
00:53:17.995 --> 00:53:19.364
Where do you want
to take that vacation?

1390
00:53:19.397 --> 00:53:22.267
Sunny California.

1391
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.834
He can go anywhere
in the world,

1392
00:53:23.868 --> 00:53:25.270
and he wants
to go to California?

1393
00:53:25.303 --> 00:53:27.405
Yep.
What's in California?

1394
00:53:27.438 --> 00:53:29.474
My white whale.

1395
00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:31.909
She must have
been very special.

1396
00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:35.746
Well, she made me want
to jump into the ocean.

1397
00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.348
(chuckles)

1398
00:53:53.631 --> 00:53:56.834
**

1399
00:54:17.021 --> 00:54:18.823
Well, that wasn't
on the itinerary.

1400
00:54:18.856 --> 00:54:20.391
How would you know?

1401
00:54:20.425 --> 00:54:21.992
You threw the itinerary
out the window.

1402
00:54:22.026 --> 00:54:24.295
I think we've done
pretty okay without it.

1403
00:54:24.329 --> 00:54:26.997
I'd like to think we've done
more than pretty okay.

1404
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:28.933
Well, I don't think
it involved a boat.

1405
00:54:28.966 --> 00:54:31.669
Or... the other thing.

1406
00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:34.038
We'll never know.
(snickers)

1407
00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:36.507
You know, I think people
get so obsessed with planning

1408
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:39.009
these perfect little lives
they're going to have

1409
00:54:39.043 --> 00:54:43.080
instead of committing
to the one that they've got.

1410
00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:45.450
Says the guy who's
afraid of commitment.

1411
00:54:45.483 --> 00:54:47.518
When did I say that?

1412
00:54:47.552 --> 00:54:50.321
You're the least organized
person I've ever met.

1413
00:54:50.355 --> 00:54:53.023
You try organizing a room
full of five-year-olds.

1414
00:54:53.057 --> 00:54:55.826
I'm committed to being
there no matter what happens.

1415
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.629
That's my job.

1416
00:54:58.663 --> 00:55:01.399
Or... it was.

1417
00:55:01.432 --> 00:55:02.600
I'm sorry.

1418
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:03.634
It's okay.

1419
00:55:03.668 --> 00:55:05.336
I had a dog.

1420
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.705
And he got sick.

1421
00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:09.874
Then he got really sick.

1422
00:55:09.907 --> 00:55:11.409
And without a second thought,

1423
00:55:11.442 --> 00:55:14.412
I dropped everything
and stayed home to help him.

1424
00:55:14.445 --> 00:55:17.014
Sounds pretty responsible.

1425
00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:18.949
Except I forgot
to tell the school.

1426
00:55:18.983 --> 00:55:20.685
Surely they understood.

1427
00:55:20.718 --> 00:55:23.688
For a week.
(chuckles)

1428
00:55:23.721 --> 00:55:25.055
After I had to put him down,

1429
00:55:25.089 --> 00:55:28.426
I lost
even more work and...

1430
00:55:28.459 --> 00:55:29.494
they had to let me go.

1431
00:55:29.527 --> 00:55:31.128
That's terrible.

1432
00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:34.899
What can I say?
The more you commit to people,

1433
00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:37.602
the more you have to be
comfortable with uncertainty.

1434
00:55:37.635 --> 00:55:39.570
I think all any of us
want to know is,

1435
00:55:39.604 --> 00:55:43.608
are you gonna
hurt me, too?

1436
00:55:43.641 --> 00:55:46.744
And the answer is,
inevitably, yes.

1437
00:55:46.777 --> 00:55:48.979
I thought I had someone
else figured out, too.

1438
00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:52.450
But people change.

1439
00:55:52.483 --> 00:55:53.484
Not that much.

1440
00:55:53.518 --> 00:55:56.787
We drift.
If you start sailing

1441
00:55:56.821 --> 00:56:00.090
and you only go
a degree off course

1442
00:56:00.124 --> 00:56:02.026
and then you
go for long enough,

1443
00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:04.595
you end up
in the wrong place.

1444
00:56:04.629 --> 00:56:07.465
Not the best metaphor to use
while we're on a boat.

1445
00:56:07.498 --> 00:56:09.934
You know what I mean.
Yeah.

1446
00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:14.071
Well, here's to smooth
sailing from here on out.

1447
00:56:21.145 --> 00:56:22.947
What's up, Percolators?

1448
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.616
Welcome to today's episode
of "Expresso Yourself,"

1449
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:27.485
where things
are getting steamy.

1450
00:56:27.518 --> 00:56:30.721
Caution!
Contents are hot, hot, hot.

1451
00:56:30.755 --> 00:56:33.123
The latest photos of Hank Pitman
hit Tumblr today

1452
00:56:33.157 --> 00:56:35.726
and there are a latte options.

1453
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.664
Here are the Top Ten responses
in order of asterisks and emo--

1454
00:56:39.697 --> 00:56:42.032
Ugh!
Rendering.

1455
00:56:42.066 --> 00:56:43.701
(phone alert)

1456
00:56:50.675 --> 00:56:52.843
(phone line ringing)

1457
00:56:52.877 --> 00:56:54.445
Girl, I'm at work.

1458
00:56:54.479 --> 00:56:56.413
Yeah, we have a problem.

1459
00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:07.692
What do you think
you're doing?

1460
00:57:07.725 --> 00:57:10.861
No. You can't
possibly expect me

1461
00:57:10.895 --> 00:57:12.930
to sleep on the floor
after last night.

1462
00:57:12.963 --> 00:57:14.999
There was nowhere else
to sleep on the yacht.

1463
00:57:15.032 --> 00:57:17.535
I just took pity on you.
Whoa.

1464
00:57:17.568 --> 00:57:21.806
If that was pity, I can't
wait to see interested.

1465
00:57:21.839 --> 00:57:25.610
Watch it, or I won't even let
you have the good pillows.

1466
00:57:25.643 --> 00:57:27.545
You know what?

1467
00:57:27.578 --> 00:57:31.549
Maybe I'll take the bed and
you can sleep on the floor!

1468
00:57:31.582 --> 00:57:33.150
Get down from there!
You're covered in filth!

1469
00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.719
You smell like a pirate!

1470
00:57:34.752 --> 00:57:37.688
Arr! That didn't stop you
from grabbing me booty.

1471
00:57:37.722 --> 00:57:40.257
Go take a shower!
Okay.

1472
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.793
But I'm taking the
good pillows with me.

1473
00:57:42.827 --> 00:57:45.730
This one and this one.

1474
00:57:45.763 --> 00:57:48.032
Hurry up. We have a walking tour
in less than an hour!

1475
00:57:48.065 --> 00:57:51.001
Of course we do.

1476
00:57:59.076 --> 00:58:00.678
(line ringing)

1477
00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:03.113
Joshua, that's how
you get bed bugs.

1478
00:58:03.147 --> 00:58:04.882
Aw, crap.

1479
00:58:09.754 --> 00:58:12.690
(line ringing)

1480
00:58:34.645 --> 00:58:36.847
(call chimes)

1481
00:58:36.881 --> 00:58:39.049
We've been trying to get
a hold of you all weekend!

1482
00:58:39.083 --> 00:58:40.184
Is Joshua there?

1483
00:58:40.217 --> 00:58:41.686
He's in the shower.

1484
00:58:41.719 --> 00:58:44.088
Oh, my God, he has
an engagement ring.

1485
00:58:44.121 --> 00:58:45.222
I mean, he doesn't know
that I know he has a ring.

1486
00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:46.591
Why does he have a ring?

1487
00:58:46.624 --> 00:58:48.058
Amy, calm down.

1488
00:58:48.092 --> 00:58:49.627
It's beautiful.
It's a little snug.

1489
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.796
But I hardly know him!
Amy, please!

1490
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:54.331
He pushes all my buttons, makes
me feel like a crazy person.

1491
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.866
But then on the boat,
we kissed.

1492
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.802
And then we more than kissed.

1493
00:58:57.835 --> 00:58:59.069
And now we're
in the Mediterranean

1494
00:58:59.103 --> 00:59:00.237
and he has this ring!

1495
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.338
Amy!
Amy!

1496
00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.107
He has a girlfriend!

1497
00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:05.175
What?

1498
00:59:05.209 --> 00:59:09.046
That punk is a lying,
cheating, scum-sucking pig!

1499
00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:10.347
You should confront him!

1500
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.082
How could he have
a girlfriend?

1501
00:59:12.116 --> 00:59:14.819
We researched him.
You did a background check.

1502
00:59:14.852 --> 00:59:16.086
Just tell her.

1503
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.055
There's tons of
pictures online

1504
00:59:18.088 --> 00:59:22.059
of him and some
really young pretty
blonde named Tiffany.

1505
00:59:22.092 --> 00:59:23.293
What does she need
that description for?

1506
00:59:23.327 --> 00:59:24.629
This isn't a police report.

1507
00:59:24.662 --> 00:59:26.597
I'm so sorry, Ames!

1508
00:59:26.631 --> 00:59:29.767
There's photo albums
dating back to four
years ago with them.

1509
00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.136
Vacations,
anniversaries.

1510
00:59:32.169 --> 00:59:33.604
Maybe they broke up.

1511
00:59:33.638 --> 00:59:34.905
Yesterday, she wrote
on his wall,

1512
00:59:34.939 --> 00:59:36.273
"Where are you?

1513
00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:38.142
I'm ready to give
you my answer."

1514
00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:41.245
And now I'm wearing
her ring.

1515
00:59:41.278 --> 00:59:43.013
You did nothing
wrong, Ames.

1516
00:59:43.047 --> 00:59:44.615
There's no relationship
status on his profile.

1517
00:59:44.649 --> 00:59:45.916
How could you have known?

1518
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.151
But we had to tell you.

1519
00:59:47.184 --> 00:59:48.285
Guys?

1520
00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.854
Is there anything
we can do?

1521
00:59:49.887 --> 00:59:51.689
Get this ring off me?

1522
00:59:51.722 --> 00:59:53.691
Just take it off!

1523
00:59:53.724 --> 00:59:54.692
I can't, it's stuck.

1524
00:59:54.725 --> 00:59:56.093
Well, it better
get unstuck.

1525
00:59:56.126 --> 00:59:57.695
Amy, you can't be
caught wearing that thing!

1526
00:59:57.728 --> 00:59:58.929
I know that!

1527
00:59:58.963 --> 01:00:00.865
It's like it's glued
to my finger.

1528
01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:02.767
That Tiffany must be
some kind of anorexic bitch.

1529
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.268
Pull it!
Not helping.

1530
01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:05.870
Just twist, okay, twist.
Just pull it!

1531
01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:07.037
Do you have butter?
Just get the butter.

1532
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.038
Where would she get butter?

1533
01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:09.006
I don't know. Oil!

1534
01:00:10.675 --> 01:00:12.943
Oh, my God.
Amy, he's coming!

1535
01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:14.144
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
I'm freaking.

1536
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:20.851
Put it back now.

1537
01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:29.827
You okay? You're doing
the pee-pee dance

1538
01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.161
my students used to do.

1539
01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:36.066
Well, that is
exactly correct.

1540
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.302
Somebody took
forever in the shower

1541
01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:40.070
and you better not have
used up all the hot water

1542
01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.906
because now I'm gonna
take one, too.

1543
01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:44.174
And I need soap.
Lots of soap!

1544
01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:48.045
Good!
Who smells like a pirate now?

1545
01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:50.715
Oh.
Hello, ladies.

1546
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.752
Hurry it up in there!

1547
01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:56.821
The ruins might not be there
if we take too long.

1548
01:01:09.734 --> 01:01:14.104
(tour guide)
The City of Ephesus is known for
housing the Temple of Artemis,

1549
01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:17.708
one of the Seven Wonders
of the Ancient World.

1550
01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:22.346
Right now, we are in
front of the magnificent
Library of Celsus.

1551
01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:26.116
What are you doing?

1552
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.085
What are you doing?

1553
01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.721
...known to store
12,000 scrolls.

1554
01:01:30.755 --> 01:01:33.257
Ow! What was that for?
Shh!

1555
01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.425
You're missing all
the... knowledge.

1556
01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.094
What's on your hand?
Nothing.

1557
01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:39.930
Let me see.
No. Uh, uh, mm...

1558
01:01:39.964 --> 01:01:41.966
Really?

1559
01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:44.234
Uh, Tiberius
Julius Aquila...

1560
01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.437
No!
It's not that big a deal!

1561
01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:48.438
Don't!
Just let--

1562
01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:50.140
I don't like it!

1563
01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:52.076
See what
you made me do?

1564
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:54.411
Listen to the guide!

1565
01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.981
Now we're going to
move on to the Agora.

1566
01:01:57.014 --> 01:02:01.518
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1567
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.822
Oh... Yes!

1568
01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.159
(tour guide)
This was built
by the Antonine family

1569
01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:14.164
during the reign of Marcus
Aurelius around 160 A.D.

1570
01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:15.800
(groaning)

1571
01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:23.808
Oh! Oh, God.
Oh! Uhh!

1572
01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:27.444
(tour guide)
Unfortunately, the water
is not drinkable

1573
01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.947
because the Romans were
known to use lead pipes.

1574
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.384
Thirsty?

1575
01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:42.993
Beautiful stonework.
So old.

1576
01:02:43.027 --> 01:02:45.062
Moving on.

1577
01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:06.216
What's really going on?

1578
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.285
It really is beautiful,
isn't it?

1579
01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:12.356
It's all right.
I'm more of an Obelisk guy.

1580
01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:16.360
I mean, fountains
are cool, too.

1581
01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:19.897
I've dreamt about this
fountain for two years.

1582
01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.598
I made it my screensaver.

1583
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:25.169
I scrapbooked.
I left my

1584
01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:26.904
jewelry on a dresser
every night

1585
01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:30.540
so that he could get my
ring size without asking.

1586
01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:32.877
God, I'm an idiot.

1587
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.912
No, that was actually
really smart.

1588
01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:39.549
I worked so hard and I
sacrificed so much and now

1589
01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:44.855
I'm standing here
alone with nothing.

1590
01:03:44.889 --> 01:03:46.623
No one is ever
gonna propose to me

1591
01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.293
in front of
this stupid fountain.

1592
01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.601
Well, maybe Josh won't.

1593
01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.238
But I can.

1594
01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:04.041
Look, Amy,
I know this is crazy,

1595
01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:05.409
but you have a dream
to be proposed to

1596
01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:08.112
in front of this fountain
and I have a ring.

1597
01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:10.580
How perfect is that?
Joshua.

1598
01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.417
This has been the most amazing
week of my entire life.

1599
01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.119
And I know you feel it, too.

1600
01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:16.286
Please don't do this.

1601
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.288
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

1602
01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:22.559
Amy Elizabeth Tyler,
let's do this.

1603
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:31.201
Ah, crap! No!
No, no! Where is it?

1604
01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:33.870
No!
You mean this?

1605
01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.573
Why do you have my ring?

1606
01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.575
Don't you mean
Tiffany's ring?

1607
01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.610
Okay, that's fair.
I can explain.

1608
01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:42.980
Explain what? That you
have a girlfriend?

1609
01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:45.115
That you have an
engagement ring in your bag?

1610
01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:46.583
That you slept with me
and lied to me?

1611
01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:49.219
Whoa, I never lied to you.

1612
01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.388
You never told me.
That's the same thing!

1613
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.157
You never asked!
All you cared about

1614
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.325
was that my name was Josh Merit
and I had a passport.

1615
01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.460
You didn't even know
I spoke Turkish!

1616
01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:59.063
This is
a little different.

1617
01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:00.998
We both wanted an escape
from our lives

1618
01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:02.332
and we didn't ask questions.

1619
01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.935
I lost everything
in a matter of weeks.

1620
01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:08.172
My world was spiraling out
of control, so I panicked.

1621
01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:11.475
I proposed. And I lost
the one thing I had left.

1622
01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:14.644
Lost her how? She wrote
on your wall yesterday.

1623
01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:16.013
What are you talking about?

1624
01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:18.315
Tiffany said
she needed time and space.

1625
01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:21.018
We lived together!
What does that even mean?

1626
01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:24.554
The next day I got an e-mail
offering me a two week vacation.

1627
01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:27.157
I couldn't be there, so I
packed a bag and came here.

1628
01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:29.960
And jumped into bed with
the first available girl.

1629
01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:31.661
Oh, please. I didn't
expect to sleep with you.

1630
01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.497
On the first day,
I didn't expect to like you.

1631
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:36.366
So, a week later,
you propose to me?

1632
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.735
You can't just
decide things, Joshua.

1633
01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.305
Feelings aren't
something you decide, Amy.

1634
01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:43.740
Or plan.
Or make up.

1635
01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.575
You were crying.
I had a ring.

1636
01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.211
What do you
expect me to do?

1637
01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:49.513
I expect you to tell me
you have a girlfriend!

1638
01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.048
Well, I expect you
to tell me

1639
01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:53.050
that you took a $3,000
ring from my bag.

1640
01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.685
I don't want your ring.
I want an apology!

1641
01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:58.188
Okay, I'm sorry!
Now, give it back.

1642
01:05:58.222 --> 01:06:00.757
It's stuck. You think I want
this piece of crap on me?

1643
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.459
Did you try
soap and water?

1644
01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:04.328
Why do you think I was in
the shower for so long?

1645
01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.395
Because you're a girl!

1646
01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:07.064
So what do we do now?

1647
01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:09.166
I don't know! You're always
the one with the plan!

1648
01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:10.767
Well, you're the one who's
so good at improvising.

1649
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.602
So, improvise!

1650
01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:23.080
Hold still,
you'll hurt the ring.

1651
01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.714
Thank you for
your concern.

1652
01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:27.651
About 1.2 carats.
Nice cut.

1653
01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.786
What kind of grade
is the stone? F?

1654
01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.055
It's E, actually.

1655
01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:32.522
Can we back to--
Ow.

1656
01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:34.791
The ring is too tight
to be removed by hand.

1657
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.494
I think the lack
of circulation is making

1658
01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:38.728
her finger
swell too much.

1659
01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.497
Then we'll cut it off.
My finger?

1660
01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.166
Should fix
the circulation problem.

1661
01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:45.235
You want me to saw
through the band?

1662
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:46.336
Yes.
No.

1663
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:48.038
Easy there,

1664
01:06:48.072 --> 01:06:49.806
jigsaw killer.
It's the only way

1665
01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.375
to cut the platinum
and save the setting.

1666
01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:53.410
Oh, platinum.
Fancy.

1667
01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:55.179
Can't we just wait and see
if her finger falls off?

1668
01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:56.680
Why are you two
even engaged?

1669
01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:58.115
We're not.
We're not.
(speaking Turkish)

1670
01:06:58.148 --> 01:06:59.549
(speaking Turkish)

1671
01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:02.619
It's your ring.
It's your problem.

1672
01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.791
(door opens and closes)

1673
01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.529
All right, hold still.
This will only take a minute.

1674
01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:14.131
Like your decision
to marry me?

1675
01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.100
You're still
wearing the ring.

1676
01:07:20.304 --> 01:07:23.240
(whirring)

1677
01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:35.785
There we go.

1678
01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:38.722
First side,
now the other. See?

1679
01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.224
Nothing to worry about.

1680
01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:42.292
Nothing to worry about?

1681
01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:44.394
Everything's a mess,
Joshua.

1682
01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:47.331
Well, sometimes
life gets messy, Amy.

1683
01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.399
It doesn't follow
your perfect little plan

1684
01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:50.700
and you have to
just go with it.

1685
01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.336
Well, that's convenient,
coming from the guy

1686
01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:53.503
who put me
in this situation.

1687
01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:55.705
You put us here, Amy.

1688
01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.707
You know,
that's your problem.

1689
01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:01.645
This whole trip--
Your plan, Amy. Yours.

1690
01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:02.812
None of this
is what I planned.

1691
01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:04.781
Yeah? Me neither.

1692
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.419
The funny part about being
spontaneous is it means

1693
01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:11.255
you actually have to
commit to your decisions.

1694
01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:14.524
Why don't we ask Tiffany
about your commitment?

1695
01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:17.827
You know, you just
rejected me and now

1696
01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:20.164
I'm destroying the most
valuable thing I own,

1697
01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:22.832
because you're right.
That's what I do.

1698
01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.901
I drop everything
to help you.

1699
01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.903
Help my students.
Help my dog.

1700
01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:29.373
How'd that work out
for you?
Wow.

1701
01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:31.775
I work with kids and
you're the most selfish
person I've ever met.

1702
01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:43.853
You still have
your return ticket?

1703
01:08:43.887 --> 01:08:45.822
Unless you took it
out of my bag.

1704
01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.824
Then I suggest you go home.

1705
01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:50.727
I never should've left.

1706
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.242
(speaking Turkish)

1707
01:09:05.275 --> 01:09:07.344
I need to exchange this ticket
for the next flight.

1708
01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:10.880
Okay.
You'll fly standby.

1709
01:09:10.914 --> 01:09:12.782
It's gate 23 over there.

1710
01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:15.352
What do I do
with this one?
Nothing.

1711
01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:16.853
Useless now.

1712
01:09:48.552 --> 01:09:52.489
(muted audio on video)

1713
01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:05.435
Hey, Tiffany.
Can I come in?

1714
01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.448
It's very lovely.

1715
01:10:18.482 --> 01:10:19.749
Excuse me?

1716
01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:20.850
Your bracelet.

1717
01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:24.321
Oh.
Thank you.

1718
01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:25.755
Boyfriend?

1719
01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:29.859
No.
From a stranger, actually.

1720
01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:32.762
Strangers can sometimes be
more important than we know.

1721
01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:35.965
Not this one.
He's unpredictable.

1722
01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:38.968
And unreliable.

1723
01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:41.338
I organized
the perfect vacation

1724
01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.440
and he couldn't just
relax and enjoy the plan.

1725
01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:47.977
I understand.
My life started
with a plan.

1726
01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:52.482
I was introduced to
a boy named Manish when
I was six years old.

1727
01:10:52.516 --> 01:10:54.818
We were to be married
when he was 18.

1728
01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.821
We were both so young
and so scared.

1729
01:10:57.854 --> 01:11:00.824
We had nothing in common.

1730
01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:05.362
On our wedding day,
we have a ceremony
called Shaka Paula

1731
01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:07.764
where the groom
gives the bride

1732
01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:13.002
a symbol of a long
and lasting marriage.

1733
01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:16.706
A bracelet.
He was just a stranger.

1734
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.076
And with a bracelet,
he became my best friend.

1735
01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.779
Don't the differences
make you crazy?

1736
01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:26.683
Why would I want to
be married to myself?

1737
01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:30.654
With Manish, every day
is an adventure.

1738
01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:32.656
I'm jealous.

1739
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:34.791
You have the security
of knowing your future.

1740
01:11:34.824 --> 01:11:37.794
Nobody knows their future.

1741
01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:41.598
I just knew who I
wanted to spend it with.

1742
01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:48.838
I can't believe this.

1743
01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:50.940
You've gotta be
kidding me. So, you, like,

1744
01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:54.110
just went to Europe for two
weeks without telling me?

1745
01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.945
You said you needed time
and space to think about it.

1746
01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:58.515
Not with another woman!

1747
01:11:58.548 --> 01:11:59.649
You have every right
to be upset.

1748
01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:01.418
Thank you for
your permission.

1749
01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:03.720
Hey, I mean, you clearly
found someone else, too.

1750
01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:05.021
Can I go?

1751
01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.890
Will you leave him
out of this?

1752
01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:08.758
I just wanted to do
the right thing

1753
01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:12.429
and let you know that I
realized we're not in love.

1754
01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:15.732
Of course we're not, Joshua.
We're comfortable.

1755
01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:17.434
I'm not comfortable.

1756
01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:19.569
Wait, but I proposed.

1757
01:12:19.603 --> 01:12:20.870
Well, I didn't say, "Yes."

1758
01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:22.005
Well, you didn't say, "No."

1759
01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:23.573
Well, I didn't
wanna hurt you.

1760
01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:25.008
That's actually
really sweet.

1761
01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.376
Hey, thank you.

1762
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:28.512
Will you just
stay out of it, man?

1763
01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:30.847
Look, I still cared
about you, dude.

1764
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.917
You lost your dog.
And then your job.
That sucked.

1765
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:37.587
But you're always doing crazy
stuff and changing your mind.

1766
01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:43.092
And I didn't wanna be a jerk.
But I didn't wanna marry you.

1767
01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:45.529
And I just figured if
I gave you enough time,

1768
01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:47.931
maybe you'd figure it out.

1769
01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:51.067
I'm sorry.

1770
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.702
Well what was your plan if
you weren't gonna marry me?

1771
01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:57.173
There was no plan.
We were just having fun.

1772
01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.575
And then we changed.

1773
01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:01.445
We didn't change,
we drifted.

1774
01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:04.113
You grew up.
But I don't want to.

1775
01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:07.651
I still wanna be young
and fun and crazy.

1776
01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:09.553
Maybe I'll go
to grad school.

1777
01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:11.555
Maybe I'll go to Europe
with strangers.

1778
01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:13.657
You wanna go
to Europe?
Shh.

1779
01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:15.725
Strangers.

1780
01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:17.461
I just can't be
locked into a plan.

1781
01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:19.463
Maybe a plan is a good thing.

1782
01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:22.432
Wow.
Who's this Joshua?

1783
01:13:22.466 --> 01:13:24.468
You must have had
one hell of a vacation.

1784
01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.803
Yeah, well, it's over now.

1785
01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:30.474
It came to an end.

1786
01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:32.108
Doesn't have to.

1787
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:35.579
Oh, my God.

1788
01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:40.917
You're right!

1789
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.886
Wait, where are
you going?

1790
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.120
I have a plane to catch.

1791
01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:45.855
Wait, can I
have the ring?
No.

1792
01:13:45.889 --> 01:13:47.691
Why would I-- What?

1793
01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.759
(sighing)

1794
01:13:49.793 --> 01:13:51.561
Do you do laundry?

1795
01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:56.500
Oh, come on, Marcie!

1796
01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:01.137
* And where should we go?

1797
01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:04.140
* And where
should we go? *

1798
01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:07.110
* And where should we go?

1799
01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:10.079
* And where
should we go? *

1800
01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:13.016
* And where should we go?

1801
01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:15.952
* And where should we...

1802
01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:17.186
* Go

1803
01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.156
**

1804
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.796
* (whistling)

1805
01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:34.103
Today on "What's Trending,"
we have a Viner named Joshua

1806
01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:37.574
posting pictures and video of
himself jumping into water

1807
01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:42.145
around the world, heartbroken
over a travel vlogger named Amy.

1808
01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:43.913
On all of Josh's
video love letters,

1809
01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:46.049
he writes the message,
hashtag,

1810
01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:48.552
"You Make Me Wanna Jump
Into The Ocean."

1811
01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.019
Some top comments.

1812
01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:53.156
This from
@SupervisorSam who says...

1813
01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:58.161
And @Julia93 writes...

1814
01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:04.300
Now, I don't wanna
jump to any conclusions,

1815
01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.136
but it seems like
Joshua is going viral.

1816
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.672
Some words of advice though.

1817
01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:11.174
Better soak it up
while you can, Joshua.

1818
01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:15.579
I mean, hemp milk is
the new coconut milk.

1819
01:15:15.612 --> 01:15:19.082
Hey, Sandra, did you see
the jumper?
Person or sweater?

1820
01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:21.017
No, this guy is jumping
in bodies of water

1821
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.686
all over the world,
professing his love

1822
01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:24.621
for this travel
vlogger named Amy.

1823
01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:26.623
My Amy?
Who knows?

1824
01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:28.692
But he's got over
4 million followers on Vine.

1825
01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:29.959
Holy sh--

1826
01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:33.697
(line ringing)

1827
01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:34.864
(call chimes)

1828
01:15:34.898 --> 01:15:37.166
Hi! So, remember how
we're best friends

1829
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.335
and I let you crash
on my couch and I
would do anything

1830
01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.204
for you and you would do
anything for me?

1831
01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:42.739
What do you want?

1832
01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:44.107
Have you seen YouTube?

1833
01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.341
In general?

1834
01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.644
Girl you're famous.

1835
01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:50.279
Oh, no, what did you do?
No, it's Joshua.

1836
01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:52.949
He's trying to look for you
and it's going viral!

1837
01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:55.351
He's all over Tumblr.
There's a meme of you.

1838
01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:58.187
It's like this parody song.

1839
01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.723
You should just see it.

1840
01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:02.058
Wait, how did I
become a meme?

1841
01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:03.727
Nobody knows how it works.

1842
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.962
Look, I just need to book
you on my show, today.

1843
01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:09.298
Wait, what?
Did you miss the part where
you're Internet famous?

1844
01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:12.368
"Amy's Adventures" is getting
millions of views out of this!

1845
01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.270
Well, what am I supposed to
talk about on your show?

1846
01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:17.373
I don't care!
Look, Joshua is running

1847
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.708
all over the world,
drowning himself.

1848
01:16:18.742 --> 01:16:19.976
I need to cover this story

1849
01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:22.612
and my best friend
is the exclusive.

1850
01:16:22.646 --> 01:16:26.850
Look you know I would be there
for you as a friend, but...

1851
01:16:26.883 --> 01:16:28.317
Do you need to make
a pro and con list?

1852
01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:30.820
No, it's just...

1853
01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:33.322
I've spent the last three months
trying to forget about Joshua.

1854
01:16:33.356 --> 01:16:34.891
Well, do you think
you could remember him

1855
01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.225
in the next three minutes?

1856
01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:37.994
Three minutes? You can't
give me more than that?

1857
01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:39.663
It's the Internet, Amy.

1858
01:16:39.696 --> 01:16:41.865
15 seconds of fame
literally means 15 seconds.

1859
01:16:41.898 --> 01:16:42.966
Come on, please?

1860
01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:46.836
I'll let you promote
Spontaneous.

1861
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:49.305
What's up, Percolators?
Today's "Expresso Yourself"

1862
01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.307
is served up live
and exclusive.

1863
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.810
My guest proves what
any electrical engineer

1864
01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.813
could've told us-- to break
the Internet, just add water.

1865
01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:58.648
So, Amy, let's dive in.

1866
01:16:58.682 --> 01:17:01.350
Tell the people
why this Joshua person

1867
01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:03.687
is traveling around
the world, looking for you.

1868
01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.421
But you know the story.
Amy!

1869
01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.958
Oh, sorry. Well, I'm
a Global Concierge

1870
01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:10.293
for Spontaneous Travel.

1871
01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:12.161
Thumbs up if you don't
know what that is.

1872
01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:15.431
And, um, three months ago,
I invited a stranger

1873
01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:18.367
from the Internet on a
discount trip across Europe.

1874
01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.904
That sounds like a plot
to a horror film!

1875
01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:24.007
Well, it was at first.
We almost killed each other.

1876
01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.675
Seriously, like, he almost
chopped off her hand.

1877
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:28.211
Finger.
It was complicated.

1878
01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:30.446
Joshua and I
met at a bad time.

1879
01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.849
We were both running
away from something,

1880
01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:35.218
but instead,
we found each other.

1881
01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:38.087
Yet, here you are,
months later,

1882
01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:40.089
being courted by
a guy whose mating call

1883
01:17:40.123 --> 01:17:43.392
is the world's loneliest
wet t-shirt contest.

1884
01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:45.061
So, Amy, what happened?

1885
01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:47.997
Is Joshua the one
that got away?

1886
01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:54.403
Well, the truth is,
I messed up.

1887
01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:59.175
I thought if I was organized
and focused and safe

1888
01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:02.779
that I could control
the future and avoid
getting hurt.

1889
01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:07.016
But life has
a plan of its own.

1890
01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:11.120
Look, I don't know
where Joshua is or why
he's making these GIFs.

1891
01:18:11.154 --> 01:18:12.789
It's pronounced "jiffs."

1892
01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:15.124
We shared this incredible

1893
01:18:15.158 --> 01:18:19.428
life-changing experience
together.

1894
01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:23.432
But it's over now.
It ended.

1895
01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:24.968
Well, you know
what they say.

1896
01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:27.136
Vacation always
comes to--
No!

1897
01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:28.972
Who actually says that?

1898
01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.140
I always thought that
was part of growing up.

1899
01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:33.276
The vacation ends.
The honeymoon is over.

1900
01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:35.344
Death and taxes.
But I searched for it,

1901
01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.914
and it's
not an actual saying.

1902
01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:41.751
Happiness doesn't have to
be temporary or special.

1903
01:18:41.785 --> 01:18:43.820
There's no reason your
whole life can't feel

1904
01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.955
like a vacation if you
find the right person.

1905
01:18:45.989 --> 01:18:48.424
Got him!
Okay.
All right. Thank you.

1906
01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.994
Yeah, I can take it
from here.

1907
01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:53.763
Joshua.

1908
01:18:53.797 --> 01:18:55.231
What are you doing here?

1909
01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:57.066
I didn't pay
my parking tickets.

1910
01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.836
Now would be a good time
to make a speech.

1911
01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:01.070
Okay.

1912
01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:03.139
Uh look, Amy.

1913
01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:07.811
When we got separated, I
couldn't go back to my old life.

1914
01:19:07.844 --> 01:19:09.779
I wanted to fix things.

1915
01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:13.316
Joshua why don't you
come talk about that
over here, on camera?

1916
01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.819
I didn't have your number,
so I couldn't call you.

1917
01:19:15.852 --> 01:19:18.855
I didn't know where you lived,
so I couldn't go to your house.

1918
01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.390
So, I went to the one place I
knew I would find you.

1919
01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:25.228
The Internet.
I filled up every corner

1920
01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.030
that I thought would
get your attention.

1921
01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:30.199
I mean, I showed millions of
people how I feel about you.

1922
01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:31.935
But you didn't
say it to me.

1923
01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:35.104
I tried. I just wanted
to finish the plan.

1924
01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:37.206
Well, sometimes
the plan changes.

1925
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.042
I don't want it to.

1926
01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:41.344
I wanna go back to
the way things were,

1927
01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:43.412
when you grabbed my hand
and jumped in the water

1928
01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.815
and changed my life forever.

1929
01:19:45.849 --> 01:19:48.017
Amy, we didn't
fall in the ocean.

1930
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:50.519
We fell in love.

1931
01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:54.891
And I will keep jumping
and jumping and jumping

1932
01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.026
if it gets me back to you.

1933
01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:03.499
Can someone turn off
the cameras, please?

1934
01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:05.168
On it.

1935
01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:21.150
You think you can give Josh
Merit a third chance?

1936
01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:27.156
No. I'm giving Michael Merit
a shot instead.

1937
01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:28.992
I'm not really a Michael.
I felt that.

1938
01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.126
Okay.

1939
01:20:33.096 --> 01:20:35.231
If you guys could wrap this up,
there's a line.

1940
01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:38.167
What is the hold up?
Come on.

1941
01:20:38.201 --> 01:20:40.169
What is the hold-up?

1942
01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:42.071
I'm gonna show you a hold-up.

1943
01:20:42.105 --> 01:20:45.108
So, what's the plan?

1944
01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:48.077
We make it up.

1945
01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.615
**

1946
01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:51.140
Hey, adventurers.

1947
01:21:51.174 --> 01:21:54.410
Apparently, Joshua has
a little surprise for me.

1948
01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:57.180
I planned us a trip.
You planned.

1949
01:21:57.213 --> 01:21:59.983
I asked Robert to plan,
but it didn't go very well.
Oh, no.

1950
01:22:00.016 --> 01:22:01.350
Where are we going?
This is...
Uh...

1951
01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:03.452
Why don't you find out?

1952
01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:09.525
We're going to--
We're going to--

1953
01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:47.296
* You've got
that beautiful... *

1954
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:50.699
* Murder face

1955
01:22:50.733 --> 01:22:51.700
**

1956
01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:55.304
* Murder face

1957
01:22:55.338 --> 01:23:01.144
* Blood in your eyes
and poison in your smile *

1958
01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:04.780
**

1959
01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.349
* I see your murder face

1960
01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:07.483
**

1961
01:23:07.516 --> 01:23:08.651
* I see your murder face

1962
01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:09.785
**

1963
01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.221
* I see your murder face

1964
01:23:12.255 --> 01:23:14.223
* I see
your murder face *

1965
01:23:14.257 --> 01:23:16.659
* Yeah *
