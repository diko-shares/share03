1
00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.590
Who's there?

2
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.840
Are you all right?

3
00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:31.174
What happened?

4
00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.092
Please...

5
00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.803
I'll go get some help.

6
00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.810
Run!

7
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.192
Are you excited?

8
00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:34.446
Yeah.

9
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:38.075
So you given any more thought
to any clubs or anything?

10
00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:39.785
I don't think I'm gonna do that.

11
00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:43.246
It's a great way to make friends.

12
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.915
I already had friends, Dad.

13
00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:47.626
I needed to get my life
back on track, Riley.

14
00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:48.669
I know.
And for that...

15
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.712
I needed a fresh start.

16
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.089
I know.

17
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.551
Smile...

18
00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.805
Hey.

19
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.265
Thank you.

20
00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.600
Let's go.

21
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.941
Are you coming?

22
00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:13.068
I am, in, like, five minutes.

23
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.736
Don't wanna be that kid, huh?

24
00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.271
Take our picture.

25
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.858
Excuse me?

26
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.693
You're a part of yearbook, right?

27
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.028
How'd you know?

28
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.654
Because your outfit reeks

29
00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.489
of second-hand boredom,

30
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.783
and you're taking pictures of everyone.

31
00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.369
So you're either a stalker,
or a part of yearbook, but...

32
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.747
either wouldn't surprise me.

33
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.125
Oh, my God, just take the photo.

34
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.212
Do we have to say cheese?
Just smile.

35
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.506
Let me fix my hair.

36
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.759
Done.

37
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.973
Hmm. Now that's a piece of
meat worth biting into.

38
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.226
Huh?

39
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.686
Mr. Sumner, new English teacher.

40
00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.563
I give it two days before I have him

41
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.732
wrapped around my little finger.

42
00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.944
All right, let's go.
These themes that we're

43
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.700
talking about, folks,

44
00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.536
these ideas,

45
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.371
they are timeless.

46
00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:51.416
That's why we're still reading this book...

47
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.376
decades later.

48
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.711
May I?

49
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.797
Um, sorry, Mr. Sumner,

50
00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.506
I was just...

51
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.341
checking in on a family emergency.

52
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.136
Right, right, right, right.

53
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:03.720
Well, please tell your
family the comment section

54
00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.555
on a social media post

55
00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.932
isn't the best place to communicate

56
00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.350
during an emergency.

57
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.147
"Looking hot, bitches."

58
00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.442
Very poetic.

59
00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:21.696
You have music on there?
Yeah.

60
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.406
So tell me a song from your playlist.

61
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:26.160
Um... "Shape Of You."

62
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.162
Ah, Ed Sheeran. Not a bad songwriter.

63
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.498
But you can only go so far

64
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.250
lyrically when writing a Top 20 hit.

65
00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:34.668
So, everyone, let's, uh,

66
00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.087
let's pull out our cell phones, please.

67
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.463
Come on, pull 'em out.

68
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.300
Now, pull up your song of the moment.

69
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.219
And let's, uh, let's take a look.

70
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.804
What you got?

71
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.181
Rihanna.

72
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.473
Really?

73
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.017
All right.

74
00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.059
Bruno Mars.

75
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.103
Yeah, I see, I see that.

76
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:55.189
Miss Taylor Swift, yes.

77
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.482
Big Shawn.

78
00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.400
Sorry, I do not know that one.

79
00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:03.113
Thank you for paying attention.

80
00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.785
Ah, yes.

81
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.329
The Beatles.

82
00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.081
One of the best bands ever.

83
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.791
If you can look past the
fact that they stole

84
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.044
from every African-American artist

85
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.254
from Chuck Berry to Bobby Parker.

86
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.839
Uh, I think you're confusing

87
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.758
inspiration for appropriation.

88
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.011
No, they stole from every
band, and you know it.

89
00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:29.973
Uh, and everyone ripped
off the Beatles, and...

90
00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.474
Brahms ripped off Beethoven

91
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.018
and Beethoven ripped off Mozart

92
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.562
and you're ripping off every cool professor

93
00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.231
who's ever stepped foot in this classroom.

94
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.107
Okay, okay, listen.

95
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.650
Take it easy.

96
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.485
Listen, the point I'm
trying to make is this.

97
00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.154
Not to sound too cliche,

98
00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:47.074
but I wanna be someone you can talk to.

99
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.284
About anything.

100
00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.036
Anything?

101
00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:53.080
Yes, anything.

102
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.457
Okay, I wanna broaden your horizons.

103
00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.543
Now, I remember what it's like to be young

104
00:06:58.585 --> 00:06:59.544
and not wanna care. You know what?

105
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.089
That's cool.

106
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.924
But in here...

107
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.133
if we can create a space

108
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:08.803
to just chill... and learn.

109
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.224
And that's what I care about.

110
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:15.643
All right, so I'll be
here every day at 7:30

111
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:19.273
if you need help or if
you, you just wanna talk.

112
00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:22.067
What about... after school?

113
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.484
Sure.

114
00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.615
All right, class, thank you.

115
00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.367
I have a good feeling we're all gonna get

116
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:32.744
quite close this semester.

117
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.458
Have a good day.
Bye.

118
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:40.127
Good day. Thanks, man.

119
00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.133
Have a good day.

120
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.427
Thanks.

121
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.247
I'm sorry...

122
00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:19.374
did you reserve this or something?

123
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.710
No, I'm just... usually
the only person in here.

124
00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.379
Oh.

125
00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.546
Heh. Okay.

126
00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.607
Can I help you?

127
00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.734
I saw you drawing in class.

128
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.029
Is that your stuff?
No.

129
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.657
Uh, my stuff is pretty much just bad.

130
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.534
Is there such a thing as bad art?

131
00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:56.244
I mean... just look at me.

132
00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.955
I'm-I'm sketching Wonder Woman fan art.

133
00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:02.334
And Picasso was making masterful
oil paintings at nine.

134
00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:04.752
But no pressure, right?

135
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.838
Well, age is just a number.

136
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.719
I'm Kyla, by the way.
Uh, I'm Riley.

137
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.637
Hi.
Hi.

138
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.473
So I'm, uh...

139
00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:18.141
I'm guessing you're into art, too.

140
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:21.019
Photography, mostly.

141
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.355
So, uh, when did you move?

142
00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.566
Um, a few weeks ago.

143
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:29.194
Yeah, my dad was looking for a fresh start.

144
00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:30.862
As he likes to put it.

145
00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:34.199
Which means that I got thrown
into a brand new school

146
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:36.159
with a bunch of new people.

147
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:40.163
Well, you met me, so, that's
one fewer new person.

148
00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.622
And really, who else do you need?

149
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.339
I'll see if I can add your
picture to the yearbook.

150
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:50.924
Yeah, sure, go for it.

151
00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.300
Uh, what's your last name?

152
00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.676
For the caption.

153
00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.597
Uh, S-Sumner.

154
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.476
As in...? Please don't say anything.

155
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.478
Having no one know me is so much better

156
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.689
than having everyone know me as Mr.
Sumner's daughter.

157
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.316
My lips are sealed.

158
00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.485
Thanks.

159
00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:14.655
Hey, um, not to take advantage, but, um...

160
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.366
I think I might be needing some extra help

161
00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:18.201
in that class this semester.

162
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.203
Do you think maybe we could study sometime?

163
00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.456
Uh...

164
00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.958
Yeah, sure, why not?

165
00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.960
Cool.

166
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.342
So, how was your first day?

167
00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.801
You look like you survived.

168
00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.095
Well, as good as can be expected.

169
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.518
Did you make any friends?

170
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.604
Yeah, I did, actually.

171
00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:30.482
And she even stuck around
when she found out about you.

172
00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:33.318
Hm, so I'm your dirty little secret.

173
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.861
Who was it?

174
00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.112
Kyla.

175
00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.405
Hm.

176
00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.823
The Beatles expert.

177
00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.534
Mm-hmm.

178
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.701
She's sharp, that one.

179
00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:44.120
I'm a fan.

180
00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.664
Huh! Well, gosh.

181
00:11:45.704 --> 00:11:47.374
Thanks for your approval.

182
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.083
See, I told you it'd get better.

183
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.545
Dad, that was just the first day.

184
00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.254
But a good first day, it seems.

185
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.589
Hmm?

186
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:08.895
Mom?

187
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.115
Mom!

188
00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.493
Hi! Hi, you're late.

189
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.495
I was covering a basketball game.

190
00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:28.081
Come here, give me a hug.

191
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.999
Maybe shower first.

192
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.792
What are you doing in that thing anyways?

193
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.336
You haven't gone on it in years.

194
00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.547
Not years.

195
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:37.756
Okay, one year. Ha-ha-ha!

196
00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:39.050
So, what's the deal?

197
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.678
Hot date?
Yeah, right.

198
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.306
Hey, any envelopes of the large variety?

199
00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:48.351
You know... in the mail?

200
00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.228
Um, nope.

201
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.356
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Maybe
if you would have applied

202
00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.484
to more than one school...

203
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.861
Okay, sorry for only wanting the best.

204
00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.908
New dress?

205
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.202
What's that?

206
00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:09.456
Oh, no. I found that in
the back of my closet.

207
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.750
I'm just gonna see if it still fits.

208
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.586
So, why is the tag still on it?

209
00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:16.463
Uh...

210
00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.923
Who is he?

211
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.384
He's just a guy.

212
00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.595
It's not a big deal.

213
00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:26.514
It's not<i> not</i> a big deal, Mom.

214
00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.683
I was just gonna slip out.

215
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.311
A.K.A. you're hiding this from me.

216
00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:33.688
You can trust me. I'm 18.

217
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.148
I'm going off to college.

218
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.650
Come on, I'm a big girl.

219
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.901
You can tell me if you're dating again.

220
00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.069
All right.

221
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.574
It's just a guy...

222
00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.159
I met at the grocery store.

223
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.035
Is this your first time seeing him?

224
00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:52.248
Mom, details.

225
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.083
You know me.

226
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.586
Good things don't happen to me.

227
00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:59.130
Okay, I will tell you...

228
00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.591
when things become real.

229
00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:02.759
Okay?

230
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.637
Okay.
All right, sweetie.

231
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.643
Ky, are you in your room?

232
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.609
Looks like you really
liked your old school.

233
00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.152
Yeah.

234
00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.279
Looks like you really
liked your friends, too.

235
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.698
Do you miss 'em?

236
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.199
Yeah, every day.

237
00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.118
I mean, we talk on the phone sometimes.

238
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.413
But it's just not the same, you know?

239
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.665
Boyfriend?
Kinda.

240
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:18.710
The start of something maybe, I don't know.

241
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.294
What about you?

242
00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:24.549
The boys here are just... boys.

243
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.384
I don't wanna deal with that.

244
00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.887
If I'm gonna be in a
relationship with someone...

245
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.639
I want it to be someone who's
mature enough to handle it.

246
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.267
Wow, good luck
finding that in high school.

247
00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:35.894
Right?

248
00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:38.354
So...

249
00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.022
What about your dad?

250
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:43.234
What about him?

251
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.445
Well, is there a Mrs. Sumner?

252
00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.531
There... was.

253
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.453
Um... I'm sorry, I shouldn't pry.

254
00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:56.581
It's... the journalist in me,
always asking questions.

255
00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:57.998
No. Just forget I said anything.

256
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.500
No, it's fine, really.

257
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.919
Don't worry about it, it's...

258
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.671
She was, uh...

259
00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.548
She was cheating...

260
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.258
on my dad...

261
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.720
for a really, really long time.

262
00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.555
I feel like I just pressured
you into sharing something

263
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:16.016
you didn't want to.
No, it's, it's fine.

264
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:18.561
Honestly, I...

265
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.396
It's just that sometimes I just...

266
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.816
I get so pissed at Dad

267
00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.484
for making me uproot my life,

268
00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:26.068
but saying it out loud like that

269
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.446
actually helps me remember
that it's not his fault.

270
00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.239
You're really close with him, aren't you?

271
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:34.619
No, I was always closer
with my mom, actually.

272
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:38.456
Now, it's just Dad and me trying to...

273
00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.959
weather the storm together.

274
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.169
Well, I think you're doing a good job.

275
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.879
I mean, at least you guys both care.

276
00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.383
My dad left when I was six, so...

277
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.970
I guess for him that was
enough time to decide

278
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.972
I wasn't worth sticking around for.

279
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.056
Wow.

280
00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:58.643
Well...

281
00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.561
Aren't we a pathetic bunch?

282
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.106
You know, I'm really glad you found me

283
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:05.942
in the corner of that computer room.

284
00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:07.944
I'm really glad I found you, too.

285
00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.321
Yeah, I think we should

286
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.405
actually start working

287
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:12.615
like we said we would.

288
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.534
I guess so.

289
00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:16.410
I'm just gonna go to the
bathroom real quick.

290
00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:17.662
I'll be right back, okay?

291
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.163
Do your thing.

292
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.711
<i>Manhood.</i>

293
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.546
<i>Womanhood.</i>

294
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.297
Right? You hear the term...

295
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.300
What do you feel?

296
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.011
What do you think?

297
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.888
What do you see?

298
00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:20.516
Oh, no, um...

299
00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:21.935
Mr. Sumner?

300
00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.477
Yes, Tricia, go ahead.

301
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.354
My pencil broke.

302
00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:26.773
Could I borrow one of yours?

303
00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:30.150
Oh, hey, you can borrow... Ow! Ahem.

304
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.072
Next time... bring a backup.

305
00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:38.367
I just don't really like
the idea of a backup.

306
00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.287
Why is that?

307
00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:42.705
Because I know what I want.

308
00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:46.250
And I never settle for second place.

309
00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:51.839
Well, that is a good attitude.

310
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.507
But the people who fail to see the value

311
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:56.928
in both preparedness and
the occasional loss...

312
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.597
rarely reach their goals, hm?

313
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:00.932
Anyone else?

314
00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.727
What are you looking at?

315
00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:13.193
Hey, you.

316
00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.572
Hi.
I'm Tricia.

317
00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.992
Although, I'm sure you
probably already know that.

318
00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.660
Yeah.

319
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:23.704
So, you waiting on Dad?

320
00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:27.207
Or should I say Mr. Sumner?

321
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.209
How do you know?
Please.

322
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:30.920
I see you ride home with him every day.

323
00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:33.089
It's kind of obvious.

324
00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.175
But don't worry, your
secret is safe with me.

325
00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:39.971
You know...

326
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.348
you're actually quite pretty.

327
00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:43.641
Maybe you shouldn't hide your face

328
00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.143
from the world so much.

329
00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:48.437
Was there something you needed?

330
00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:50.857
I was just gonna say you probably shouldn't

331
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.900
hang around Kyla so much.

332
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.276
What do you mean?

333
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.903
I've just never seen her hang around

334
00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.697
with a guy before, that's all.

335
00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.448
Kyla and I are just friends.

336
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.700
Good.

337
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:01.909
Then you wouldn't mind being

338
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.577
my shopping buddy tonight?

339
00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:06.580
So?

340
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:08.082
What do you say?

341
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.545
I guess.

342
00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.257
Great. See you later then?

343
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:18.676
Bye.

344
00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.184
What the h...

345
00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.810
You scared the crap out of me.

346
00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.478
What the hell was that?

347
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.313
And you ruined my drawing, thank you.

348
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.982
Why were you talking to Tricia?

349
00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:34.316
What was she saying to you?

350
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.027
Nothing, s-she was just asking me

351
00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.611
if I wanted to go shopping, that's all.

352
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:39.279
I heard her mention my name.

353
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:40.948
Were you spying on me?

354
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.867
No, I was not spying on you, okay?

355
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.160
I came over to say hello,

356
00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:46.079
and I saw you talking to Tricia.

357
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.580
She's dangerous, Riley.

358
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.415
How?

359
00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:50.958
Uh, well, for starters,

360
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.002
she's very clearly obsessed with your dad.

361
00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:56.338
No, I think she's just
like that with everyone.

362
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.132
No, I know her.

363
00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.467
This is different.

364
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.344
Look, she's done this before.

365
00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:05.098
What do you mean?

366
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.307
Last year, Tricia got really attached

367
00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.769
to one of our history teachers.

368
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.106
They started meeting up
after school really often.

369
00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:15.649
Rumors started going around

370
00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:17.443
and they replaced him with a substitute

371
00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:19.528
for the rest of the year.

372
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.405
We never were told why, but...

373
00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:23.783
I'm pretty sure Tricia had
something to do with it.

374
00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.325
I just...

375
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:28.495
I don't want something
like that to happen again.

376
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:30.915
Because I like you, and
it'd be pretty great

377
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.708
if you could stick around.

378
00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:38.089
Thanks for the heads up.
Of course.

379
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.257
That's what friends are for, right?

380
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.591
Yeah.

381
00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:48.682
Hey, friend.

382
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.851
When's your birthday?
Why?

383
00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:52.770
I'm filling out your yearbook profile.

384
00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.606
October 14th.
No way.

385
00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.483
Why? Do you have the same birthday as me?

386
00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:59.068
<i>'Cause that'd be too creepy.</i>

387
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.612
October 18th, but close enough.

388
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.698
Hm. Wow, so you're younger than I am.

389
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.619
Uh, no, actually, I was held
back in elementary school.

390
00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:12.915
Are you gonna have a party?
I don't know.

391
00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:15.459
You have to, it's your 18th birthday.

392
00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:17.086
I went all out on mine.

393
00:22:17.128 --> 00:22:19.130
Can't remember a thing from that night.

394
00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:21.423
It's just that, I don't know anyone.

395
00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:24.010
Well, I could totally make a post

396
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:25.427
for a party at your place.

397
00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.305
What?
Yeah.

398
00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:28.973
Advertise a little get together.

399
00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.725
Well, I thought you
didn't have any friends.

400
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.060
It doesn't matter.

401
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:34.270
Every bozo in our class

402
00:22:34.312 --> 00:22:35.813
will show up if you offer beer.

403
00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:39.066
My dad would never...

404
00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:43.487
You don't actually have to have beer.

405
00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.447
You just tell them you're going to.

406
00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:47.574
<i>Okay, that feels a bit hollow.</i>

407
00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.035
But you know what?

408
00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:50.494
It's kinda perfect too.

409
00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:53.080
I'm full of amazing ideas.

410
00:22:55.916 --> 00:23:00.213
Hey, uh, I just wanted to
apologize again about before.

411
00:23:00.254 --> 00:23:02.631
Oh, that's fine, don't worry about it.

412
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.677
Does stuff like that
happen to your dad a lot?

413
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:08.428
<i>People like Tricia?</i>

414
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:12.474
I don't, I don't think so.

415
00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.268
I mean, he's just not that kinda guy.

416
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.187
<i>You know?</i>

417
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.898
<i>He always goes on to me
about moral high grounds</i>

418
00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:20.524
<i>and blah, blah, blah.</i>

419
00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.069
Also...

420
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.695
Apparently he's seeing someone.

421
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:27.031
That was quick. <i>I know.</i>

422
00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:29.449
<i>Apparently he met her at the grocery store.</i>

423
00:23:33.204 --> 00:23:35.289
Uh, I gotta go. <i>Kyla?</i>

424
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:38.251
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?

425
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.044
Is this him?
Kyla!

426
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.841
Mr. Sumner.

427
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.343
Um, Kyla.

428
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.512
You're here for Jess?

429
00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:52.139
Oh, uh, your mother...

430
00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:53.849
I presume, yes.

431
00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:56.018
Oh, for heaven's sake,
just let the man in. Hi.

432
00:23:57.644 --> 00:24:00.480
Wow, you are radiant.

433
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:01.648
Thank you.

434
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.401
You're gonna make me blush.

435
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:05.403
Oh, I, I doubt that.

436
00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:10.074
Oh, sorry, so you met Kyla.

437
00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:11.867
My daughter.
Yes.

438
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:14.245
Uh, Kyla is in my English class.

439
00:24:14.287 --> 00:24:16.080
Wait...

440
00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:17.415
Is this too weird?

441
00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:19.541
Are you... okay with this?

442
00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:23.129
I'll manage.

443
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.757
All right, um, sorry,
uh, these are for you.

444
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.050
Oh, thank you.

445
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:30.010
They're beautiful, thanks.

446
00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.929
Yeah.

447
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:34.432
Oh, do you wanna get a vase, honey?

448
00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:35.433
Um, yeah.

449
00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:36.850
Okay.

450
00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:43.274
Wow.

451
00:24:43.316 --> 00:24:44.984
You have a, a beautiful home.

452
00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.484
Thanks.

453
00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:47.569
Yeah.

454
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:51.740
What?
Oh, my God.

455
00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:54.034
What's, what's funny?

456
00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:56.996
When you talked about being a teacher,

457
00:24:57.037 --> 00:25:00.416
I just didn't think about you
being a high school teacher.

458
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:03.543
And how is that funny?
Sorry. I don't know.

459
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:07.047
I just, I never had a
handsome English teacher...

460
00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:09.133
like you, when I went to school, so...

461
00:25:09.175 --> 00:25:10.092
Thank you.

462
00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:12.052
Oh.
Oh, Kyla.

463
00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:13.887
Wow.
I'm so sorry.

464
00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:15.597
Kyla!
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

465
00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:17.641
I am... No, don't, don't worry.

466
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.768
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God.
It's, it's, it's just cotton.

467
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.020
It's...

468
00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:22.604
I-I'm sorry.
Oh, uh... Yeah.

469
00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:24.940
I am sorry, I'll get that.
Sorry.

470
00:25:24.982 --> 00:25:27.109
Please...

471
00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:29.527
Oh, man.
Are we late?

472
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:32.614
No, it's fine, I-I just don't
exactly have a, a backup shirt.

473
00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:34.074
So...
I know.

474
00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:35.533
Oh, um...
Gosh, um...

475
00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:36.785
I mean...

476
00:25:36.827 --> 00:25:38.578
You guys could do your date here.

477
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:41.915
Hmm. There is an idea, huh?

478
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:44.626
Yeah, I mean, uh, I could
help you cook something.

479
00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:47.338
Or I could just hang out in my room.

480
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.174
No way, come on. Join us.

481
00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:52.009
That's, I mean... Is that... Yeah?

482
00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:54.387
That's a great idea. I
mean, I can help too.

483
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:57.264
I'm not exactly horrible
with a spatula, you know?

484
00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:59.433
Wonderful, good.
Thanks.

485
00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:01.227
Why don't you just see what
we have in the kitchen?

486
00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.728
Okay? 'Cause I don't know.
Okay.

487
00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:04.938
So, and I have an extra shirt upstairs.

488
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.899
Yeah?
If you wanna...

489
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.402
Sure. Please, lead the way.
Sure.

490
00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:20.246
Then I just read that 80% of fitness

491
00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:22.373
is what comes out of the kitchen, so...

492
00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:24.833
I have decided to cut down on my baking.

493
00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:26.335
Eighty percent?

494
00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:27.503
That seems kinda high.

495
00:26:27.545 --> 00:26:28.962
I mean, you can have a cookie

496
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:30.548
every now and then, right?

497
00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:31.965
Well, I do bake the
meanest white chocolate

498
00:26:33.426 --> 00:26:34.885
macadamia nut cookie

499
00:26:34.927 --> 00:26:36.136
you've ever eaten.

500
00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:38.347
Okay.

501
00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:42.893
Hey. Ky.

502
00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:45.354
Is there something that you
would like to share with us?

503
00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:47.731
Hm?
Hey, that is my line.

504
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:50.943
It is?

505
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:52.152
Sorry.

506
00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:54.488
Hey, how is Frost

507
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.323
stacking up with your old school?

508
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.576
It's great, smart kids...

509
00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.202
teachers are good.

510
00:27:00.244 --> 00:27:02.871
But teaching's been a piece of cake.

511
00:27:02.913 --> 00:27:04.081
I mean, to be honest.

512
00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:06.459
Wow, you are so humble.

513
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.586
No, what I mean is,

514
00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:10.254
uh, teaching's always been like

515
00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:13.173
a hobby compared to
raising Riley on my own.

516
00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:14.592
Oh, that's nice.

517
00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:17.303
A-and I see the same fire in Kyla.

518
00:27:17.344 --> 00:27:20.764
I'm so happy the two of you
are becoming close friends.

519
00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:24.351
So, um, where are you going to school?

520
00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:27.938
Well, I applied to Emerson,
for journalism, technically,

521
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.857
but ideally, I would like to pair that

522
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:32.568
with my passion for photography.

523
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.653
That's right. I always see
you with that camera.

524
00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:37.615
You see me?

525
00:27:37.655 --> 00:27:41.327
Uh, yeah, on campus, taking
pictures of everyone.

526
00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:44.413
That is so
awesome, about Emerson.

527
00:27:44.455 --> 00:27:48.125
Emerson is the only
place that she applied.

528
00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:49.418
Mom.

529
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.586
There's a word

530
00:27:50.628 --> 00:27:52.588
for that kind of overconfidence.

531
00:27:53.671 --> 00:27:55.215
Is that true?

532
00:27:56.883 --> 00:27:58.718
I know what I want.

533
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.762
So it seems.

534
00:28:02.889 --> 00:28:06.226
Uh, Jess, that was terrific.
Mmm.

535
00:28:06.268 --> 00:28:09.021
An impromptu meal
whipped up from scratch?

536
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:10.939
Are you sure you don't
do this professionally?

537
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:13.526
Oh, now you're just flattering me.

538
00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:15.777
I... Plus, I had two excellent sous-chefs.

539
00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:17.154
No, no, don't be modest.

540
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:20.157
I mean, I could eat that... every day.

541
00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:21.699
I'm serious.

542
00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:22.826
Where do you think
these compliments

543
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:24.286
are gonna get you?

544
00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:26.163
I don't know.

545
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:29.416
But I can't wait to find out.

546
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.378
All right, um, I'm gonna
go finish my homework.

547
00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:36.131
Okay, honey.

548
00:28:38.384 --> 00:28:40.344
Okay. Good night.

549
00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:42.137
Good night.
Yeah, um...

550
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:07.120
Kyla, what is wrong?

551
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.788
There's someone outside my window.

552
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.541
Oh, my God. Are you sure?
What?

553
00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:12.959
I was changing, and I saw
someone outside watching me.

554
00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.378
All right, just, just wait here, okay?

555
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.213
I'll be right back. Just... Okay.

556
00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:17.631
Come here, sweetheart.

557
00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:19.799
You're safe, come on.

558
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:21.843
Okay. Are you okay?

559
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:23.512
I'm shaking. I don't know who it was.

560
00:29:23.554 --> 00:29:25.305
I know, so what happened?
I don't know.

561
00:29:25.347 --> 00:29:27.683
I was changing, I saw someone, and...

562
00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:29.727
They were just watching me.
Oh...

563
00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:34.440
Well, whoever it
was, they're gone now.

564
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.858
Did you see who it was? No.
We should call the police.

565
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.611
No. We don't have to do that.
I...

566
00:29:38.652 --> 00:29:40.195
Yeah, I think we should.
Please.

567
00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:42.155
I really don't wanna make
a big deal about this.

568
00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:44.199
Now, this is a big deal, okay?
If someone's spying on you...

569
00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:46.452
There's nothing we can
even tell the police.

570
00:29:46.493 --> 00:29:48.412
I didn't even see who it was.

571
00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:49.747
No, we-we should do something.

572
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.665
I agree.
Uh, maybe...

573
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:54.251
I could just hang out here with you guys.

574
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:58.422
Of course. I mean, I
don't wanna intrude.

575
00:29:58.464 --> 00:30:00.633
No.
Come on, that's nonsense.

576
00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:01.967
Let's sit down.
Okay.

577
00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:03.594
Okay, I'll go make some tea.

578
00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:05.053
Okay.
Okay?

579
00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:11.017
You sure you don't mind?

580
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.312
Yeah. No, I don't mind.

581
00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:14.688
Thank you for checking outside.

582
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.316
Yeah, of course.

583
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.777
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

584
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.987
I wanna stay.

585
00:30:22.028 --> 00:30:23.989
Good. Good.

586
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.325
Besides, Riley, she's out with
her friend tonight, so it's...

587
00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:27.867
Oh, who?

588
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:29.745
Uh, Tricia from school.

589
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.414
Okay, so...

590
00:30:32.456 --> 00:30:34.040
Oh.

591
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:35.375
Cards?

592
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:38.754
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, cards.

593
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.305
Uh...
Oh, um...

594
00:30:48.347 --> 00:30:50.349
Whoa.
Um, sorry.

595
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.184
Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:57.773
Hey, good morning, sweetie.
Hey.

597
00:30:57.815 --> 00:30:59.817
Hey, I told Chris he could use your shower.

598
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:01.109
I hope you don't mind. No, not at all.

599
00:31:02.444 --> 00:31:04.112
Okay.

600
00:31:04.154 --> 00:31:05.905
Did you make him breakfast, too?

601
00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:07.282
Mm-hmm.

602
00:31:07.324 --> 00:31:08.450
You really like him, don't you?

603
00:31:08.492 --> 00:31:10.577
Do you?

604
00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:12.078
Yeah?

605
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.623
Wow, this looks amazing.

606
00:31:14.665 --> 00:31:16.333
What a masterpiece, Chef Jess?

607
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:18.335
Good morning.
Good morning.

608
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:19.919
Mmm. Yeah.
For me?

609
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.339
Mine?
Yes.

610
00:31:22.381 --> 00:31:23.590
Hey, honey, I need to get gas

611
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:24.800
on the way I take you to school.

612
00:31:24.842 --> 00:31:26.468
So, will you eat fast?
Mm-hmm.

613
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.470
Uh, don't be silly, Kyla can ride with me.

614
00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:30.889
I'm going to school, anyway, so...

615
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.140
Right.

616
00:31:49.575 --> 00:31:52.035
So, um, about this morning...

617
00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:54.621
Don't worry about it, okay?

618
00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:57.708
It's not the first time
I've seen a naked man.

619
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.126
I just hope the water
pressure was adequate.

620
00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:06.091
So, um, tell me about, um, photojournalism.

621
00:32:06.132 --> 00:32:08.385
Well, not much to tell, really,

622
00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:10.345
I just, uh...

623
00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:12.013
I love observing people.

624
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:14.266
You can tell a lot about someone

625
00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:16.017
when they think no one's watching.

626
00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:18.144
So, what can you tell about me?

627
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.146
You're assuming that I observe you?

628
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:22.357
Am I assuming too much? Sorry.

629
00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:24.777
Perhaps.

630
00:32:28.154 --> 00:32:30.783
One school, though.

631
00:32:30.824 --> 00:32:32.576
That is a bold move

632
00:32:32.618 --> 00:32:34.327
and, and very risky.

633
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:38.331
I can tell that you're a
great student, but...

634
00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:40.208
finishing high school without
a contingency plan...

635
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.460
I got in.

636
00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:44.463
That's, that's incredible.

637
00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:47.424
And you haven't told your mom yet.

638
00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:50.176
I'm waiting for the right time.

639
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:53.096
She hasn't really dealt with
the idea of me leaving yet.

640
00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:55.307
Being alone.

641
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:59.185
She doesn't see how grown up I've become.

642
00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:02.272
Well, I can see it.

643
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:08.528
Hi.

644
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.905
Hey.

645
00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:15.911
Who died?

646
00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:27.840
Hey.

647
00:33:27.881 --> 00:33:30.216
You weren't that the computer lab.

648
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.177
You okay?
I'm fine.

649
00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:37.641
Are you mad at me, or something?

650
00:33:37.683 --> 00:33:39.142
Why would I be mad at you?

651
00:33:39.184 --> 00:33:40.853
I-I-I don't know.

652
00:33:40.894 --> 00:33:43.229
Oh, how was hanging out with Tricia?

653
00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:45.899
Heard you guys went out.
This is what this is...

654
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:49.695
After I specifically told
you to stay away from her.

655
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:51.571
She's using you, Riley.

656
00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:53.114
Using you to get to Chris.

657
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:55.367
Chris?

658
00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:57.160
You mean Mr. Sumner?

659
00:33:57.202 --> 00:33:58.495
Whatever.

660
00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:00.914
Well, that's interesting, because, uh,

661
00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:02.040
well, she came over last night

662
00:34:02.081 --> 00:34:03.416
to pick me up.

663
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:05.043
And then she said it was you

664
00:34:05.084 --> 00:34:08.046
who was messing around
with that history teacher.

665
00:34:08.087 --> 00:34:09.214
And you believed her?

666
00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:11.800
She had some pretty good points.

667
00:34:11.842 --> 00:34:13.760
One of them being the fact that

668
00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:16.179
she wasn't even in his history class.

669
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:17.806
Well, she's lying to you.

670
00:34:17.848 --> 00:34:19.391
And she says you're lying.

671
00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:21.100
Look, you can pick whatever side you want,

672
00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:23.061
but it's pretty clear
you've made your mind up.

673
00:34:23.102 --> 00:34:24.646
Look, I didn't come here for a fight...

674
00:34:24.688 --> 00:34:26.773
So, why did you come here?

675
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:28.608
Actually, I have a lot of work
to do, so if you don't mind,

676
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.319
you can take your poor
judgment somewhere else.

677
00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:33.196
Well, you've got a mean streak.

678
00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:34.698
Enjoy the dark.

679
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.748
So, what's that scar from on your arm?

680
00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.249
When I was five...

681
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.167
Oh, yeah? What were you doing in the truck?

682
00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:48.045
I was just...

683
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:50.296
Oh, look, it's Miss Yearbook.

684
00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:51.757
Ow!

685
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.592
What's your problem?

686
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:55.677
Stay away from Riley.

687
00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.303
Jealous much?

688
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.305
What, are you afraid I'll
take her away from you

689
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:02.141
and you'll go back to being the
sad, little loner that you are?

690
00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:05.812
I will end you.

691
00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:07.230
Why are you so upset?

692
00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:09.274
I'm the one who should be pissed.

693
00:35:09.315 --> 00:35:11.651
Spreading rumors about me.

694
00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:17.156
Yeah, keep walking, stalker.

695
00:35:59.825 --> 00:36:01.952
Hey, I... Kyla...

696
00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:03.870
If you're here to accuse me of lying again,

697
00:36:03.912 --> 00:36:06.331
I'm really not in the mood, so, just...
leave me alone.

698
00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:08.291
I'm not, I'm...

699
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:09.668
Oh!

700
00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.255
Oh, my God. Kyla, what is this?

701
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:16.008
What... Hey!

702
00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:18.510
What are... What is this? Kyla, what...

703
00:36:21.471 --> 00:36:22.973
Kyla...

704
00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:25.934
Kyla?

705
00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.939
Yeah!

706
00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:38.071
Kyla, what's wrong?

707
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:41.033
I'm so sick of high school
and this petty drama.

708
00:36:41.074 --> 00:36:42.701
Oh, well...

709
00:36:43.994 --> 00:36:46.788
Hey, I'm gonna find who did this, okay?

710
00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:49.582
All right.
Okay.

711
00:36:52.669 --> 00:36:53.920
All right?

712
00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:02.804
Hey.
You know what?

713
00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:04.222
I am going into that school

714
00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:05.932
tomorrow, and I'm gonna demand

715
00:37:05.974 --> 00:37:08.309
that they do an investigation.

716
00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:10.062
They're already looking into it, Mom.

717
00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:13.773
So, you know I'm here for you, right?

718
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:15.316
I mean, for anything.

719
00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:17.360
Everything.

720
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:19.445
I know. I know, Mom.

721
00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:22.949
So, what about those pictures, Kyla?

722
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:26.745
I don't know, they were just...

723
00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:28.747
for me, okay?

724
00:37:30.123 --> 00:37:31.708
I don't know how anyone got a hold of them,

725
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.086
and I don't really wanna think about it.

726
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:36.421
All right.

727
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:40.425
Well, I just wanna make sure

728
00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:42.052
that you are not getting

729
00:37:42.094 --> 00:37:44.345
taken advantage of, okay?

730
00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:46.806
I'm not, trust me.

731
00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:48.558
After that whole thing
that happened last year...

732
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.895
Mom. Mom. Believe me, okay?

733
00:37:51.937 --> 00:37:54.439
No one is taking advantage of me.

734
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.690
You don't have to worry.

735
00:37:55.732 --> 00:37:57.358
Well, that is my job.
Hm.

736
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.861
I worry.
Mm-hmm.

737
00:37:59.903 --> 00:38:02.614
Boy, you're growing up, huh?

738
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:03.907
All right, so how about some good news?

739
00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:05.825
Did we get any mail today?

740
00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:07.953
I got into Emerson.

741
00:38:07.994 --> 00:38:09.495
Oh, my God!

742
00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:12.832
I'm so... Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you!

743
00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:14.542
Oh, my God! You... Come here.

744
00:38:14.584 --> 00:38:16.586
Oh, my...

745
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:18.088
So, you're not sad?

746
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.466
Well, I... Of course I'm gonna be sad.

747
00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:23.384
But you know, you doing what you love,

748
00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:25.053
that's what makes me happy.

749
00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:29.182
Besides, I'm not gonna be totally alone.

750
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.851
I mean, I've got Chris.

751
00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:34.395
Don't you think, maybe you guys

752
00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:35.939
are moving too fast?

753
00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:38.066
I don't know.

754
00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:39.442
Can you just promise me

755
00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:40.819
if anything sketchy comes up,

756
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.570
you won't just ignore it?

757
00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:44.281
Okay.

758
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:45.657
I promise.

759
00:38:45.698 --> 00:38:47.117
Thank you.
Oh, my God.

760
00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:49.119
Congratulations, honey!
Thanks.

761
00:38:53.957 --> 00:38:56.459
Oh, um...

762
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.877
I can go somewhere else.

763
00:38:57.919 --> 00:38:59.629
No, uh, wait.

764
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:02.299
I think I owe you an apology.

765
00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:11.099
Listen, I...

766
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:13.351
I was seeing Tricia...

767
00:39:13.392 --> 00:39:14.686
being so forward with my dad

768
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:16.771
and getting so wrapped up in it

769
00:39:16.813 --> 00:39:18.190
that I just...

770
00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:19.858
I just started getting paranoid, and...

771
00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:21.318
and then I remembered what you were saying

772
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.277
about your own dad, and I just...

773
00:39:22.319 --> 00:39:23.528
Look, I, I'm sorry,

774
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:25.905
I put you in that position.

775
00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:28.533
It's just that, Chris...

776
00:39:28.574 --> 00:39:30.202
Mr. Sumner...

777
00:39:30.243 --> 00:39:32.495
he's the first guy my mom
has dated in ten years

778
00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:34.247
who's been somewhat decent.

779
00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:36.916
He's kind to her, and considerate, and...

780
00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:40.753
It's just not something I'm used to.

781
00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:42.755
And I'm sorry I got so attached to that.

782
00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:44.216
I don't have to be.
No, no.

783
00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:46.384
You shouldn't be apologizing for that.

784
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:49.012
I'm the one who's sorry.

785
00:39:51.514 --> 00:39:53.099
Are we okay?

786
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.600
I think so.

787
00:39:57.812 --> 00:39:59.772
So, um, about those pictures...

788
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:01.816
You don't have to explain.
No.

789
00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:03.193
I want to.

790
00:40:03.235 --> 00:40:04.986
I want you to know.

791
00:40:05.028 --> 00:40:08.073
Last year, with that history teacher,

792
00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:09.699
that was me.

793
00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:12.202
He made me feel special, and...

794
00:40:12.244 --> 00:40:14.162
I took those pictures for him, but...

795
00:40:14.204 --> 00:40:16.706
I realized that it was
wrong, and I reported it.

796
00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:18.416
I just...

797
00:40:18.457 --> 00:40:20.543
I don't know who got a
hold of those pictures.

798
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.254
I mean, my guess would be Tricia...

799
00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:23.922
No one deserves that.

800
00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:27.967
Especially, not you.

801
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.180
I know I've only known you
for a short amount of time,

802
00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:35.892
but I think you might be the
best friend I've ever had.

803
00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:50.823
Hey, Kyla.

804
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:52.533
Hi.
Hey, need a ride?

805
00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:54.911
Yeah, actually. Is Riley coming?

806
00:40:54.953 --> 00:40:56.996
Uh, no, she's got an after-school project,

807
00:40:57.038 --> 00:41:00.166
but I'm heading home, if
you wanna catch a lift.

808
00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:02.710
Yeah, that'd be great.
Great.

809
00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:04.421
All right.

810
00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:05.671
How was school?

811
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:07.840
Um, school, you know...

812
00:41:16.433 --> 00:41:18.143
Oh...
Whoa!

813
00:41:18.184 --> 00:41:20.895
What are you doing?
Just sit still.

814
00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:26.651
For the yearbook.

815
00:41:26.692 --> 00:41:28.736
Oh, poor yearbook.

816
00:41:30.155 --> 00:41:33.574
Well, thank you for the ride, Mr. Sumner.

817
00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:37.287
Uh, please, just call me Chris.
Chris.

818
00:41:37.329 --> 00:41:39.789
So, I will see you later tonight?

819
00:41:40.957 --> 00:41:42.250
Uh, yeah?
Yeah.

820
00:41:42.292 --> 00:41:44.127
I'm seeing your mom later, so...

821
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:46.338
Right.

822
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.425
All right, well, uh, thank you again.

823
00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:51.968
You're welcome.

824
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.719
Please tell your mom I said hello.

825
00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:54.929
I will.

826
00:41:56.055 --> 00:41:57.515
Oh, and, uh, please

827
00:41:57.556 --> 00:41:59.225
finish reading chapter ten.

828
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:00.601
I'm looking forward to it.

829
00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:03.188
I know you are. Ha, ha.

830
00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:04.563
Bye.

831
00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:45.688
Hey, I'm heading out.

832
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.065
Okay.

833
00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:49.984
So, uh...

834
00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:51.569
How is everything, hm?

835
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:52.987
Look, I know I was nervous

836
00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:54.322
about the move and everything.

837
00:42:54.364 --> 00:42:57.158
Nervous? Well...
Okay.

838
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.701
Upset.

839
00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:01.954
But you, uh, you were right.

840
00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:05.166
I was a little resentful and...

841
00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:07.585
It was, it was not fair to you.

842
00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:09.504
You know?

843
00:43:09.546 --> 00:43:10.963
I just want you to know that...

844
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:13.591
I appreciate you.

845
00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:15.468
I know you do.

846
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:22.392
Is Chris here?

847
00:43:22.434 --> 00:43:23.393
In the bathroom.

848
00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:26.854
Is this his?

849
00:43:26.896 --> 00:43:28.356
Uh, yep.

850
00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:32.402
Why is he getting text from Tricia?

851
00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:35.738
Mom, you have to read it.

852
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.116
Mm-mm.
You promised.

853
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.286
Okay, fine, then I will.

854
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:42.995
Okay, fine.

855
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:49.961
"I want you to watch me touch
myself under my desk."

856
00:43:50.002 --> 00:43:53.423
Oh, hey, beautiful, you ready?

857
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:55.550
We should go, we're just, uh...

858
00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:57.676
Whoa. What?

859
00:43:59.596 --> 00:44:00.763
What?

860
00:44:00.805 --> 00:44:02.474
Jess.
What?

861
00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:04.142
What're you even talking about?
I don't know.

862
00:44:04.183 --> 00:44:05.726
What's going on
in your phone here, huh?

863
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:08.146
I've never texted a student in my life.

864
00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:10.106
Okay?
Oh, okay.

865
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:12.108
I don't know how
she got my number.

866
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.110
Is that Tricia Wilson?
Yes.

867
00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:16.695
Wait, she's the
same age as Riley.

868
00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:18.615
Wow, I hope you get fired.

869
00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:20.366
You don't even know what
you're talking about, okay?

870
00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:21.742
Have you actually fooled around

871
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:22.994
with any of your students?

872
00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:24.412
Do you hear yourself?

873
00:44:24.454 --> 00:44:26.164
Asking me these questions?
Do I...

874
00:44:26.205 --> 00:44:27.832
Of course I haven't
fooled around with them.

875
00:44:27.873 --> 00:44:29.542
I've never touched a
student in my life, okay?

876
00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:31.919
Okay, you need to leave,
and you need to leave now.

877
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:33.421
Jess. Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess.
Just go.

878
00:44:33.463 --> 00:44:35.298
No, no, no, I'm done.

879
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:39.927
This is not what you think it is.

880
00:44:39.969 --> 00:44:41.304
Uh-huh.

881
00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.964
So, listen, I'm sorry.

882
00:45:17.006 --> 00:45:18.466
I really wanted this to work,

883
00:45:18.508 --> 00:45:20.051
with your mom.

884
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:22.178
Did you lie?

885
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.096
No, I've never touched Tricia.

886
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:27.099
Has she texted you before?

887
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:28.393
Kyla.

888
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.103
Did you lie?

889
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:33.856
Yeah, okay, she texted
me before, all right?

890
00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:35.816
But I never texted back.

891
00:45:37.527 --> 00:45:39.945
You just felt nice to
be talked to that way?

892
00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:42.948
Kyla.

893
00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:45.951
You spent almost

894
00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:49.205
every minute of the last 18 years...

895
00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:50.206
Kyla.

896
00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:51.874
...being a husband.

897
00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:54.419
Parent.

898
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:57.004
Teacher.

899
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:59.507
When do you get to just be a man?

900
00:45:59.549 --> 00:46:01.133
Kyla, listen...

901
00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.344
Just... Hey, hey, what are you doing?

902
00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:04.929
Just...

903
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.931
When do you get what you want, and...

904
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.477
not have to feel bad about it? Hmm?

905
00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:12.895
We should probably just...

906
00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:19.611
Your mom is...

907
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.453
Listen, you should just, just get off...

908
00:46:28.494 --> 00:46:31.372
Shh. It's okay.

909
00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:49.557
Consider that my thesis statement.

910
00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:22.859
Mr. Sumner.
Yeah.

911
00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:24.652
Mr. Sumner, um...

912
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:27.446
I have a question
on number eight.

913
00:48:27.488 --> 00:48:30.449
I was just really struggling
with number eight.

914
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:31.868
Mm-hmm? I don't know, it's like...

915
00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.369
you're asking here...

916
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:36.455
Well, yeah, that really changes things.

917
00:48:41.878 --> 00:48:44.463
Hey, are you having trouble
with number eight as well?

918
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:47.592
Uh, no, I finished 15 minutes ago.

919
00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:50.969
You left this at my house.

920
00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:17.789
Focus on your test, please.
What's going on?

921
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.457
One of the students
from your class.

922
00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:20.792
Which one?

923
00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:23.252
Tricia?
Is everything okay?

924
00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:24.545
Yeah, okay.

925
00:49:24.587 --> 00:49:25.713
Yeah.

926
00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:31.968
Tricia, I need you to get up, please?

927
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.471
Why?

928
00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:36.014
Just grab your things, and let's go, now.

929
00:49:54.826 --> 00:49:57.119
I don't know
where you're taking me.

930
00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:02.625
Let's get these tests finished.
Focus, please.

931
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.130
Test's over, please, face down.

932
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:09.214
Thank you.

933
00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:11.550
Good luck.

934
00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:16.597
I have no idea.

935
00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:18.891
Um, I'll see you later, okay?

936
00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:20.100
Thanks.

937
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:32.279
Are you okay?

938
00:50:32.321 --> 00:50:34.573
I-I just don't know what to do.

939
00:50:34.615 --> 00:50:36.450
About my mom? Yeah.

940
00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:40.872
Maybe you two just weren't meant to be.

941
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.208
Maybe you found someone better.

942
00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:47.085
What are you doing?

943
00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:08.190
So, I guess they found something on Tricia.

944
00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:09.567
Seems like it.

945
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.986
I wonder what they'll do to her.

946
00:51:12.028 --> 00:51:14.070
It's not our problem anymore, right?

947
00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:18.074
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

948
00:51:18.116 --> 00:51:20.452
See you at the party.
Yeah.

949
00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.456
You're really friends with that turd?

950
00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:26.458
Quentin's not a turd.

951
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.627
Okay, I kinda like those guys too.

952
00:51:28.669 --> 00:51:30.588
You're seriously defending them?

953
00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:31.923
Have you learned nothing?

954
00:51:31.964 --> 00:51:34.132
Oh, my God, Kyla, just let it go.

955
00:51:34.174 --> 00:51:36.677
You're not my only friend, okay?

956
00:51:36.719 --> 00:51:38.387
Okay, sorry.

957
00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.348
Okay.
Bye.

958
00:51:50.775 --> 00:51:52.108
Hey, Mom.

959
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.612
I'm heading off to Riley's party.

960
00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:55.696
It smells good in here.

961
00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:57.406
Yeah, stress-baked

962
00:51:57.448 --> 00:51:58.950
a huge batch of cookies.

963
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:00.785
You wanna take some?
No, thanks.

964
00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:03.079
What happened to the fitness regimen?

965
00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:04.455
I don't know what I'm thinking.

966
00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:06.874
I mean, seriously, a 42-year-old

967
00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:08.667
single, divorced mother.

968
00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:11.837
How can I compare to a Tricia Wilson?

969
00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:13.965
Don't compare yourself to her.

970
00:52:14.006 --> 00:52:16.174
She's disgusting.

971
00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:18.260
Besides, she was hauled
in for sign today, so...

972
00:52:18.302 --> 00:52:20.345
Yeah, do you know why she got in trouble?

973
00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:22.138
I do.

974
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.767
They found a broken phone in her locker.

975
00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:27.645
Those pictures of you were on it.

976
00:52:27.686 --> 00:52:29.647
She did that.

977
00:52:29.688 --> 00:52:30.982
Your principal called me

978
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:33.191
asking me what I wanted to have done.

979
00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:34.735
I was like, "Well, let her have it."

980
00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:36.528
Wow.
Good riddance!

981
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.154
Don't worry about it.

982
00:52:38.196 --> 00:52:40.365
You're gonna find someone
better than him, okay?

983
00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:41.533
I know it.

984
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:43.911
Thank you, sweetie.

985
00:52:43.953 --> 00:52:45.955
Uh, do you want me to stay
and hang out for a while?

986
00:52:45.997 --> 00:52:48.958
No, I do not. You go on,
and have fun with Riley.

987
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.918
Okay. Text me if you need anything.

988
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.503
Okay, sweetie. Love you.
Bye.

989
00:52:52.544 --> 00:52:53.671
Love you.

990
00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:00.385
Hey, guys.
Hey, what's up?

991
00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:02.596
Thanks for coming, enjoy the party.

992
00:53:03.722 --> 00:53:05.808
Hi.

993
00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:06.809
Hey.

994
00:53:06.851 --> 00:53:08.352
Aw, thank you.

995
00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:10.688
You're so sweet.

996
00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:14.274
Now, look who's here.

997
00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:15.442
Wow.

998
00:53:15.484 --> 00:53:16.986
Hi.
Oh, my God.

999
00:53:17.028 --> 00:53:18.654
This is all because of you.
Are you drunk?

1000
00:53:18.696 --> 00:53:20.322
No.

1001
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:22.658
Come on, it's still my dad's place.

1002
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.077
Um, well, here.
What?

1003
00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:26.328
Where did that come from?

1004
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.788
Just open it.

1005
00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.918
Oh, my God, Kyla.

1006
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.838
You shouldn't have.
But I did.

1007
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.339
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1008
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:38.883
That is so sweet.

1009
00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:46.140
Uh... This is for you.

1010
00:53:47.808 --> 00:53:51.269
What? No one should turn 18 sober.

1011
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:52.897
Just, uh, keep it for yourself, okay?

1012
00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:54.815
Oh, yeah, you, uh, you betcha.

1013
00:53:54.857 --> 00:53:56.441
It's my birthday. Mm-hmm.
Oh, okay.

1014
00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:58.152
Uh, I'm gonna go inside for a little bit.

1015
00:53:58.194 --> 00:53:59.987
And I'll see you soon.
All right, see you later.

1016
00:54:00.029 --> 00:54:01.237
Okay.

1017
00:54:25.137 --> 00:54:26.597
Hey.
Hey.

1018
00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:28.306
What are you doing up here?

1019
00:54:28.348 --> 00:54:30.101
Just wanted to say hi.

1020
00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:32.603
You work too hard.

1021
00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:38.776
Yeah, I just want to be alone.

1022
00:54:38.817 --> 00:54:41.779
I'm messing up with your mom.
You didn't mess anything up.

1023
00:54:42.905 --> 00:54:44.322
Yes, I did.

1024
00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:46.450
Not from my point of view.

1025
00:54:47.367 --> 00:54:50.079
Kyla, stop, I just...

1026
00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:52.039
I'm not in a good mood right now.

1027
00:54:52.957 --> 00:54:54.917
Let me make you feel better.

1028
00:54:59.755 --> 00:55:02.216
Don't you want to be
outside with your friends?

1029
00:55:03.341 --> 00:55:05.427
They're not my friends.

1030
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:15.229
My daughter... Is currently preoccupied.

1031
00:55:18.565 --> 00:55:20.358
Look, this is too much, all right?

1032
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.318
You-you-you need to leave.

1033
00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.702
Am I gonna have to repeat myself?

1034
00:55:33.538 --> 00:55:34.957
Mind says no.

1035
00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:51.765
We can't do this.

1036
00:55:51.807 --> 00:55:53.642
No.

1037
00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:55.602
We shouldn't do this.

1038
00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:57.688
There's a difference.

1039
00:56:00.816 --> 00:56:02.026
Be a man.

1040
00:56:41.106 --> 00:56:42.358
Dad?

1041
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:47.363
Are you kidding me?

1042
00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:48.739
Are you f...

1043
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.865
Dad, what the hell?

1044
00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:51.033
Riley.

1045
00:56:51.992 --> 00:56:53.285
Nice. Real nice.

1046
00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:55.329
Riley, wait, hey!

1047
00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:56.830
Riley, wait!

1048
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:03.503
Riley. Riley!

1049
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:06.757
Riley.

1050
00:57:06.798 --> 00:57:08.259
Riley, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1051
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.053
She's the only friend I have, okay?

1052
00:57:11.095 --> 00:57:14.430
Or had. Great. Why her?

1053
00:57:14.472 --> 00:57:16.016
I didn't mean for this to happen, okay?

1054
00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:17.684
But I swear to you, I swear, that's it.

1055
00:57:17.726 --> 00:57:19.061
It is over.

1056
00:57:19.103 --> 00:57:20.687
You were the one who moved me.

1057
00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:22.522
You call this a fresh start?

1058
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:26.026
Have you been drinking?
What?

1059
00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:28.987
Are you drinking? Don't
you dare turn this on me.

1060
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:30.572
There's a big difference between what I did

1061
00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:31.990
and what you're doing, okay?

1062
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:33.658
Riley. Wait!

1063
00:57:39.915 --> 00:57:41.792
Go home!

1064
00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:43.252
Now!

1065
00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:09.486
Where are you going?

1066
00:58:09.527 --> 00:58:11.989
Look, it's fine. She's probably just drunk.

1067
00:58:13.157 --> 00:58:15.117
What?

1068
00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:16.368
I thought you knew.

1069
00:58:17.453 --> 00:58:19.330
You thought I knew what?

1070
00:58:19.371 --> 00:58:21.790
About Riley's drinking problem.

1071
00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:23.583
I've been trying to get her to see someone,

1072
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:25.961
but she just won't listen to me.

1073
00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:28.464
So, she's been doing this for a while?

1074
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:31.216
As long as I've known her.

1075
00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:33.677
I need to find her.
Look, just stay.

1076
00:58:33.718 --> 00:58:35.971
She'll come back.

1077
00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:39.141
In the meantime, we have the
house all to ourselves.

1078
00:58:39.183 --> 00:58:41.393
What do you say, we pick
up where we left off?

1079
00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:43.145
Do you know how insane that sounds?

1080
00:58:43.187 --> 00:58:46.440
You're my student. Oh,
please, you wanted it.

1081
00:58:46.482 --> 00:58:48.066
I'm not letting you go that easy.

1082
00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:49.985
What are you saying? Are
you threatening me?

1083
00:58:50.027 --> 00:58:52.488
Need I remind you who didn't ask my age?

1084
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:57.075
Oh, pick up the jaw, sugar. I'm legal.

1085
00:58:57.993 --> 00:58:59.495
Please.

1086
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:02.247
Stay.
Riley needs me.

1087
00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:04.333
Are you saying she's more
important than I am?

1088
00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:06.251
Of course she's more important than you.

1089
00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:34.405
You are not taking him away from me.

1090
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.934
Riley.

1091
01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.227
Riley, stop, please, just...

1092
01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.771
I have nothing to say to you, okay?

1093
01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:10.190
Are you okay?
Do not touch me.

1094
01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:11.816
Let me explain.
I said no!

1095
01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.485
Get away from me.

1096
01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:20.658
Bradbury further cemented
his literary mastery

1097
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.702
with a series of shorts,

1098
01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:25.205
each one displaying a balanced tone

1099
01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:27.916
of fervent optimism and fear...

1100
01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.460
as you know.

1101
01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:32.754
So, anyone care to share their take

1102
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.924
on any of the approved Bradbury shorts?

1103
01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:40.220
Anyone? Speak.

1104
01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:45.100
Kyla.

1105
01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.852
I read Ray Bradbury's "The Fog Horn."

1106
01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.605
A bit obvious.

1107
01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.566
But first thoughts?

1108
01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:55.819
Well, it's a story about isolation,

1109
01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.779
wonder...

1110
01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.657
forlorn history... lust.

1111
01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:03.494
Well, I'm glad you picked up
on the inherent loneliness...

1112
01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.329
Of course.

1113
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.915
A slick creature looking for one last mate.

1114
01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:11.418
Looking for one...
Sorry.

1115
01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.295
You didn't let me finish.

1116
01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:15.130
I'm glad you picked up on the loneliness.

1117
01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:18.675
Ah, but you're ignoring the
deep themes of mystery

1118
01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:20.802
and unified empathy,

1119
01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:24.389
in order to focus on a shallow, sleek

1120
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.600
and easy interpretation.

1121
01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:29.269
I hope in your next reading,
you're a bit more thorough.

1122
01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.438
Anyone else?

1123
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.441
Come on.

1124
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:43.575
Come on. Someone? Speak.

1125
01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.327
Share. Enlighten.

1126
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.746
All right, today's class,

1127
01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.124
please do your homework.

1128
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.835
Half of your grade is participation, okay?

1129
01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.263
What was that?
Kyla...

1130
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.474
I don't know what you're
trying to do, but you can't...

1131
01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:10.602
Kyla! Get your stuff.

1132
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.063
Now!

1133
01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:14.981
Jess, listen, I just...

1134
01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.157
Now.

1135
01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:39.715
He is your teacher.

1136
01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.216
That's not why you care.

1137
01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.093
You're jealous.

1138
01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:45.845
That is ridiculous.

1139
01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.389
Look, I've scheduled a meeting

1140
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.433
with your principal for this Wednesday.

1141
01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.059
Okay, so tell them.

1142
01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:54.229
I'm 18. So, I'm free to
do what and who I want.

1143
01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.940
What is the matter with you?

1144
01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:58.358
Are you my daughter?

1145
01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.068
We're in love.

1146
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.321
Those pictures... And Tricia? I mean...

1147
01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.658
Was any of that even real?

1148
01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.493
Did you make all of that up?

1149
01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.454
How about you find a new distraction

1150
01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.956
that doesn't interfere
with my personal life?

1151
01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:15.875
Go back to cycling, or baking.

1152
01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:19.837
I don't care. Just stay out of my way.

1153
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.257
I'm still meeting with your principal.

1154
01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.676
Kyla.
Pick up your phone!

1155
01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:51.453
How could you do this?

1156
01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.455
You're ruining your career.

1157
01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.081
Your life.

1158
01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.208
My life.

1159
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.876
Everything.

1160
01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.462
You're right.

1161
01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.841
That's exactly what I did.

1162
01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:09.846
I don't know. There's nothing
that I can do or say...

1163
01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:14.225
to make it up to you right now.

1164
01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:18.021
I was so broken when your mom left.

1165
01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:20.148
I have been so empty.

1166
01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:25.362
So lost.

1167
01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.074
I'm so lost.

1168
01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.162
I let this happen.

1169
01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.959
But it's over, okay?

1170
01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:43.547
And no one is worth losing you over.

1171
01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.883
I should have realized that from the start.

1172
01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:48.719
And that's a mistake I'm
gonna have to live with

1173
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.804
for the rest of my life.

1174
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:58.102
I don't expect you to forgive me, okay?

1175
01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.772
I just want you to know that I'm sorry.

1176
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.360
I'm so sorry.

1177
01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:26.882
I didn't expect you to answer.

1178
01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.551
We need to talk.

1179
01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:35.557
Hm. Stalker.

1180
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.728
Well, I'm here.

1181
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.730
What do you want?
To clear the air.

1182
01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:43.690
I didn't steal those photos of you.

1183
01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.191
Your phone says otherwise.

1184
01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:46.943
You planted them.

1185
01:05:46.984 --> 01:05:49.613
I don't know how you did, but you did.

1186
01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:50.739
You don't have any proof.

1187
01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:51.989
I lost scholarships

1188
01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.617
because of you, you little bitch.

1189
01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:55.702
So, what are you gonna do about it?

1190
01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:57.036
Huh?

1191
01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.082
Gonna take a swing at me?

1192
01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.334
No.

1193
01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:06.797
Come on. Free shot.

1194
01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.423
Here, I'll start out for you.

1195
01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.467
Okay?

1196
01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:11.843
Hey! Stop.

1197
01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.219
What are you doing?

1198
01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.013
Stop.

1199
01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.141
What's wrong? Are you not having fun yet?

1200
01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:20.894
Kyla, stop!

1201
01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:22.854
What the hell!

1202
01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.609
Chris is mine.

1203
01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.862
What the...

1204
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:33.239
What the hell!

1205
01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:39.329
Stay right here.

1206
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.914
Stay right here. Stay right here.

1207
01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:42.666
Kyla, what the hell!

1208
01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.840
Hey, what's going on over here?
Chris!

1209
01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.549
Chris, help! She broke my fingers.

1210
01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.050
What?
Chris!

1211
01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.427
She's crazy.
Chris, help me.

1212
01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:56.053
She broke my fingers.

1213
01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:57.889
What did you do? Huh?
I-I-I didn't do anything.

1214
01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:59.933
Riley. Riley, call 911, okay?
Let me see. Let me see.

1215
01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:01.768
Hold on, wait, wait. Let me see.

1216
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.562
There's been an
assault at Frost High School.

1217
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.405
I knew you'd come to my rescue.

1218
01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.242
Well, the officers
are gonna take you

1219
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.662
to the hospital, okay?

1220
01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.288
Okay.
Here you go.

1221
01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:25.583
Bye.

1222
01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:29.253
Kyla, hi!

1223
01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.797
I'm sorry, I just got the messages.

1224
01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:33.090
I've been in meetings all day.

1225
01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:34.175
Are you okay?

1226
01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.260
It's just my hand, Mom.

1227
01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:37.762
What do you mean just your hand?

1228
01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.015
Well, I'm a little high on pain meds.

1229
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:42.726
Uh, and the doctors said I
might have a concussion,

1230
01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.394
so I have to stay here overnight.

1231
01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.855
So, you were telling the
truth about Tricia.

1232
01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:49.691
Yeah, she's insane.

1233
01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.902
Okay, well, we still do need
to talk about what happened...

1234
01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:55.196
Before you say anything,
I just wanna apologize

1235
01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:56.907
about before.

1236
01:07:56.948 --> 01:08:01.703
I was rude and disrespectful,
and I'm sorry.

1237
01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:05.456
I think, um, you were right about Chris...

1238
01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.668
and everything.

1239
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.211
I want you to promise

1240
01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.297
that you're not gonna see him anymore.

1241
01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:18.970
Maybe, just...
to say goodbye?

1242
01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:24.935
Why don't you rest?
Mom, please.

1243
01:08:24.976 --> 01:08:26.978
Fine.
Thank you.

1244
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.022
Yeah.

1245
01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.786
Look, I don't really know what to say

1246
01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.579
other than I'm sorry.

1247
01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.040
Oh, I didn't come here to forgive you.

1248
01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:49.918
I came here to thank you.

1249
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.544
Um, to thank me?

1250
01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.379
Yeah, his, uh...

1251
01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:56.173
His relationship with you

1252
01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:58.384
helped him see that he needs help.

1253
01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.386
And he's gonna find some.

1254
01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:02.764
I'm gonna help him.

1255
01:09:02.806 --> 01:09:06.101
I didn't do anything wrong.
Yes, you did.

1256
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.352
You-you used me, you seduced my dad.

1257
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.398
And my dad promised me
he'll stay away from you

1258
01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.776
for good, so...

1259
01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:16.069
It's over.

1260
01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:17.278
Is that clear?

1261
01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.824
Yeah.
Okay, good.

1262
01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.283
Look, I know you're upset...

1263
01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.660
Okay, don't even begin to pretend

1264
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.869
you know how I'm feeling, okay?

1265
01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.496
I'm not, I-I'm just...

1266
01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:28.706
I'm trying to apologize.

1267
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:33.377
I understand if you never
want to see me again, but...

1268
01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:36.089
I have to ask a tiny favor of you.

1269
01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:37.340
Are you kidding me?

1270
01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:38.591
I-I know the timing is terrible,

1271
01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:40.510
but... I'm supposed to cover

1272
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.095
the girls' volleyball playoffs,

1273
01:09:42.137 --> 01:09:46.474
and with my hand, I can't
exactly take pictures.

1274
01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:49.477
I know you hate me, but I really
don't wanna let the team down.

1275
01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.897
They'll be devastated if they
don't get coverage on this.

1276
01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.025
You can even use my camera.

1277
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.611
I'll do it for the team.

1278
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.323
Not for you. That's all that I ask.

1279
01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:05.326
Okay, then.

1280
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:07.453
Goodbye.

1281
01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:09.330
Uh, before you go, um...

1282
01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.377
Could I maybe speak to
your dad one last time?

1283
01:10:14.418 --> 01:10:16.796
Just to say goodbye.
Okay.

1284
01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.719
You ready?

1285
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.554
I'm gonna go cover the
volleyball game, okay?

1286
01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:27.306
She, uh...

1287
01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.642
She wants a word with you first.

1288
01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.268
To say goodbye.

1289
01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.355
I can catch a ride with someone else.

1290
01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.191
It's fine. Don't worry.

1291
01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.235
I don't have to go in there.
It's up to you.

1292
01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:40.444
All right, text me when you get there.

1293
01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:41.863
I will.

1294
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:48.452
My hero. Heh.

1295
01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.246
How you doing?

1296
01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.332
A lot better now.

1297
01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:55.585
Good.

1298
01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.963
Listen, Kyla, we...
I did it.

1299
01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:01.465
Did what?

1300
01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.051
I convinced my Mom and Riley

1301
01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:05.636
that there's nothing going on between us.

1302
01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:07.597
That is great.

1303
01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:10.558
I'm so glad that you understand.

1304
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.103
Now, with Tricia completely
out of the picture,

1305
01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:17.107
we can just have our little
secret all to ourselves.

1306
01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:21.194
Kyla, we don't have a little secret.

1307
01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:23.029
We never did.

1308
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.989
This, it is over.

1309
01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:26.741
I thought I made that clear to you.

1310
01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.993
No... Chris, no.

1311
01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.995
This is just the beginning.

1312
01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:32.914
Kyla...
Don't you see?

1313
01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.290
What we have is rare.

1314
01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:36.459
We need to harness it and nurture it.

1315
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.544
Don't just sweep your
feelings under the rug.

1316
01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.296
I don't have feelings for you.

1317
01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:42.132
Don't lie to yourself, baby.

1318
01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:44.217
It's unhealthy.

1319
01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:47.011
You need me... and I need you.

1320
01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:50.056
This is forever.
Stop, okay?

1321
01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:53.226
You're crazy. Fate brought us together.

1322
01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:56.729
Now, we just need to be a
little bit more careful.

1323
01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.815
Kyla, you need help, okay?

1324
01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:00.399
Serious help.

1325
01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:03.527
Just stay away from me.
Stay away from Riley.

1326
01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:06.739
We never wanna see you, ever again.

1327
01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:09.617
Well, you have to see me again, Chris.

1328
01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:12.162
In class, tomorrow,

1329
01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.205
and the day after that,
and the day after that.

1330
01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:15.873
No, no.

1331
01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:19.627
If this is how it's gonna
be, I'm gonna quit.

1332
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.337
You know what, I'm gonna
clean out my desk tonight.

1333
01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:22.880
Uh, no, you can't.

1334
01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:24.465
If that's what it takes to keep you

1335
01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.134
out of our life, then yes.

1336
01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:28.970
You can't.
I have to.

1337
01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.056
And you're clearly not ever gonna stop.

1338
01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.809
Look at me.

1339
01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:35.852
This is it, Kyla.

1340
01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:38.313
We're done, for good.

1341
01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.731
Do not walk away from me.

1342
01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.151
Chris, do not walk away from me!

1343
01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:14.849
Hey, sweetie, it's me.

1344
01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.560
I'm, uh... I'm here.

1345
01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:20.688
I'm actually at the school. Uh...

1346
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.606
Just... Will you meet me in my classroom

1347
01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.525
when you're finished?

1348
01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.903
I'll explain when I see you.

1349
01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.572
Okay, I love you.

1350
01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:32.033
Bye.

1351
01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:47.715
Hey, Ky?

1352
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.432
Kyla?

1353
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.935
Uh...

1354
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.232
Kyla?

1355
01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.490
<i>Hey, sweetie, it's me.
I'm here.</i>

1356
01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.576
<i>I'm actually at the school.</i>

1357
01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.245
<i>Will you meet me in my classroom</i>

1358
01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.080
<i>when you're finished?</i>

1359
01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.171
Hello?

1360
01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.638
My God...

1361
01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:38.349
Hi, friend.

1362
01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:42.853
I'm sorry, but there's only
room for one woman in his life.

1363
01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:53.197
Oh, God.

1364
01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.782
And it's gonna be me.

1365
01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.201
Oh, God...

1366
01:14:58.535 --> 01:15:00.204
Oh, my God.

1367
01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:16.553
A little mood lighting.

1368
01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.056
Kyla, what the
hell are you doing here?

1369
01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.351
What do you think?

1370
01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:23.353
I'm here for round two.

1371
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.980
I hope you're ready.

1372
01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.316
What are you talking about?

1373
01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.445
Why do you have that?

1374
01:15:32.487 --> 01:15:35.906
It's just a little toy to
make things more exciting.

1375
01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.450
Hey! Stop!

1376
01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:40.453
Come closer. Oh, God.
What are you doing?

1377
01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:43.789
Shh! I'm in charge tonight, okay?

1378
01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.749
You can have it next time.

1379
01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.856
Enough! Stop!
I can't.

1380
01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:12.151
You're my everything.

1381
01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:14.111
I had something close last year,

1382
01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:17.532
but he just couldn't cut it.

1383
01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:20.326
He didn't give me everything I needed.

1384
01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:21.869
But you do.

1385
01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.496
I'm not gonna let you go.

1386
01:16:23.538 --> 01:16:26.082
I don't want any part of this.
You know that. Uh!

1387
01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.833
Are you saying you don't want me?

1388
01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:31.462
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Oh, please.

1389
01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:35.632
That night in your office was
the best night of your life.

1390
01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:37.927
They'll all be like that, Chris,

1391
01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.845
from now on.

1392
01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.098
That was a mistake.

1393
01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:45.226
Don't say things like that to me.

1394
01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:48.854
Oh!
It hurts my feelings.

1395
01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.398
If you want it to be better,

1396
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.733
you just have to tell me how you like it.

1397
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.570
Ow-ow-ow! Stop!

1398
01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.989
I think that's enough foreplay for now.

1399
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:01.284
Are you as excited as I am?

1400
01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.411
Kyla, stop it!

1401
01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:05.538
Stop. Stop it!
No!

1402
01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.706
I'm sick of you not listening to me.

1403
01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:18.468
From now on, you're gonna
do things when I say, okay?

1404
01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:21.554
That's how this relationship
is going to work.

1405
01:17:21.596 --> 01:17:23.722
I don't like having to raise my voice,

1406
01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.309
so you're gonna have to listen to me.

1407
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:27.643
Stop!

1408
01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:29.061
Ah!

1409
01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.188
We're gonna start a new family, okay?

1410
01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.150
I'll give you a new Riley.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1411
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:37.069
What'd you do to Riley?
Baby, calm down.

1412
01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:46.621
I'm sorry, I know how
much she meant to you,

1413
01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:48.539
but there just wasn't room for her

1414
01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:50.124
in our future plans.

1415
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.751
Kyla, just stop it.
Baby, calm down.

1416
01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.044
Stop!

1417
01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.720
That hurt, Chris.

1418
01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:06.307
That's too rough.
Where's Riley?

1419
01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:08.267
That's not how this is going to work.

1420
01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.609
Oh, no! Chris!

1421
01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:25.201
Who's there?

1422
01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.026
Are you all right?

1423
01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.236
What happened?

1424
01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.320
Please...

1425
01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:02.988
I'll get help.

1426
01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:15.334
Run!
What?

1427
01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:23.300
Sorry, this event is invite-only.

1428
01:19:35.812 --> 01:19:37.231
You're a monster.

1429
01:19:38.815 --> 01:19:40.901
Where's my dad?

1430
01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.236
He's having a little rest.

1431
01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:44.071
We can't have you disturbing him.

1432
01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:53.497
You can't hide from me!

1433
01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:41.712
Come on, Riley.

1434
01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:44.632
We knew we couldn't both share him.

1435
01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:47.176
We knew this had to happen eventually.

1436
01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:55.892
Just die!

1437
01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.779
I'm not sorry.

1438
01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:08.405
I know.

1439
01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.959
Everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

1440
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.336
Everything's gonna be all right.

1441
01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:26.131
Okay? Okay? You're gonna be fine.

1442
01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:30.845
You son of a...

1443
01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:39.978
I'm scared.
It's over now, okay?

1444
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.438
It's all over now.

1445
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.482
I'm here. No, I'm here.

1446
01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:45.651
I'll be right in there, hold on. Hold on.

1447
01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:22.396
Are you ready for your first day?

1448
01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.522
Oh, hey.

1449
01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.065
Yeah, just, um...

1450
01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.067
putting some finishing
touches on my syllabus.

1451
01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:29.779
Hm.
Then I'm headin' out.

1452
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.115
Well, um, I'm sure it'll be great.

1453
01:22:33.156 --> 01:22:35.367
Just, please don't brag that much

1454
01:22:35.409 --> 01:22:37.994
about your music history
knowledge this time, okay?

1455
01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.247
That is a good teaching tool.

1456
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:45.419
So, um... How about you, hm?

1457
01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.212
You ready for your big first day?

1458
01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:49.632
You know what? I think I am.

1459
01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.967
One good thing about giant
college lecture halls

1460
01:22:52.008 --> 01:22:53.427
is that the professor can't tell

1461
01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.262
if you're drawing or paying attention.

1462
01:22:56.263 --> 01:22:58.474
Riley...
I'm kidding.

1463
01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.350
I'll pay attention, don't worry.

1464
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.102
Good.

1465
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:08.233
The keys?
Oh, the keys.

1466
01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.611
That's right. Um...

1467
01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:14.448
So, be safe on the freeway.

1468
01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:15.866
I will.

1469
01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.368
I'll see you at dinner, okay?

1470
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:19.453
You bet.
