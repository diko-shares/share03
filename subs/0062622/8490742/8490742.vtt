mystery about what is going on there.

-Oh, really?
-Yes, yes.

107
00:31:06.114 --> 00:31:10.410
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

108
00:31:10.618 --> 00:31:14.789
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

116

...was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

117

That does sound odd.

a bit of a row about it.

119
00:31:42.984 --> 00:31:46.863
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

120

Is this, in fact, what has happened?

I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

130

00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:45.771
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

169
00:42:46.313 --> 00:42:50.943
...which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

170
00:42:53.195 --> 00:42:54.280
Now...

171
00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:59.076
...I know there have been some
conflicting views...

172
00:42:59.326 --> 00:43:02.955
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

173
00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:06.876
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

174
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:10.838
...created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base.

175
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:15.843
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

176
00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:19.930
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

177
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:25.269
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

178
00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:29.231
I completely sympathise
with your negative views.

179
00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:34.195
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

180
00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:39.283
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

181
00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:41.869
And I hope you will too.

182
00:43:44.497 --> 00:43:47.333
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

183
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:50.211
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

184
00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:52.797
...contained in this situation...

185
00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:55.508
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

186
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:58.803
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

187
00:43:59.553 --> 00:44:00.888
Anyway...

188
00:44:01.096 --> 00:44:03.307
...this is the view of the Council.

189
00:44:04.183 --> 00:44:08.354
The purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

190
00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:10.272
...on the situation...

191
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.651
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

192
00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:18.989
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

193
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:24.036
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

194
00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:29.250
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

195
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.212
Well, I think that's about it.

196
00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.506
Any questions?

197
00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:41.220
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

198
00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:44.223
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

199
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.685
FLOYD:
I don't know, Bill.

200
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:52.064
I suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the Council.

201
00:44:52.273 --> 00:44:55.025
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

202
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:58.904
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

203
00:44:59.113 --> 00:45:02.032
As some of you know,
the Council has requested...

204
00:45:02.241 --> 00:45:04.952
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

205
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.038
...from everyone who has
knowledge of this event.

206
00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.959
Were there any more questions?

207
00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:21.135
HALVORSEN: I'm sure
we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...

208
00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:22.803
...as fully as possible...

209
00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:28.475
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

210
00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:31.353
HALVORSEN: Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
FLOYD: Thank you.

211
00:47:08.867 --> 00:47:10.160
MICHAELS:
Anybody hungry?

212
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.207
FLOYD: What've we got?
MICHAELS: You name it.

213
00:47:19.086 --> 00:47:21.380
FLOYD: Is this chicken?
MICHAELS: Something like that.

214
00:47:21.547 --> 00:47:23.382
MICHAELS:
Tastes the same, anyway.

215
00:47:24.049 --> 00:47:25.300
HALVORSEN:
Got any ham?

216
00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:26.969
MICHAELS:
Ham, ham, ham....

217
00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:28.804
HALVORSEN:
There, that's it.

218
00:47:32.057 --> 00:47:33.100
Look pretty good.

219
00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:36.061
MICHAELS: They're getting better at it
all the time.

220
00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:39.982
HALVORSEN:
That was an excellent speech.

221
00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:41.400
MICHAELS:
It certainly was.

222
00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:44.319
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

223
00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:45.821
Thanks, Ralph.

224
00:47:46.071 --> 00:47:48.657
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

225
00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:50.451
I admire how
you've handled this.

226
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:54.204
HALVORSEN: It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

227
00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:57.041
We're only too happy to
be able to oblige.

228
00:47:57.624 --> 00:47:59.334
MICHAELS:
Have you seen these yet?

229
00:47:59.626 --> 00:48:02.963
HALVORSEN: Have a look.
MICHAELS: Here's what started it all.

230
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:04.882
FLOYD:
Oh, yeah.

231
00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.675
HALVORSEN:
When we found it...

232
00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:08.844
...we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

233
00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:12.181
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

234
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:17.061
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

235
00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.979
So we decided to have a look.

236
00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:21.732
MICHAELS: We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

237
00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:25.611
...so we excavated out,
but we didn't find anything else.

238
00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:28.822
HALVORSEN: And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

239
00:48:29.031 --> 00:48:32.159
...it hasn't been covered
by erosion or other forces.

240
00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:34.703
It's been deliberately buried.

241
00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:37.623
Deliberately buried.

242
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.920
MICHAELS:
How about a little coffee?

243
00:48:43.128 --> 00:48:45.047
FLOYD: Great.
HALVORSEN: Good idea.

244
00:48:50.552 --> 00:48:53.514
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is?

245
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.682
HALVORSEN:
I wish to hell we did.

246
00:48:56.058 --> 00:49:00.270
The only thing we're sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago.

247
00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:05.109
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

248
00:49:05.317 --> 00:49:06.985

Watch this, now. It's hot.

were put aboard asleep...</i>

BOWMAN: <i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

he has feelings...</i>

BOWMAN: How are you, Hal?

384
01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:34.342
-<i>Everything's running smoothly, you?</i>
BOWMAN: Not too bad.

385
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.220
-<i>Have you been doing more work?</i>
-A few sketches.

386
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.931
-<i>May I see them?</i>
-Sure.

387
01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:46.395
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

388
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.732
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

389
01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:53.903
-<i>Can you hold it a bit closer?</i>
-Sure.

390
01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:58.074
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

391
01:08:01.285 --> 01:08:02.870
<i>By the way...</i>

392
01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:06.624
<i>...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

393
01:08:07.124 --> 01:08:08.751
No, not at all.

394
01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:11.504
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

395
01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:15.633
<i>...but lately I've wondered...</i>

396
01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:19.762
<i>...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission?</i>

397
01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:21.639
How do you mean?

398
01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:25.810
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

399
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:30.398
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

400
01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:35.820
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

401
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:40.199
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

402
01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.578
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

403
01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.667
That's a rather difficult
question to answer.

404
01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:52.545
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

405
01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.464
No, not at all.

406
01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:59.218
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

407
01:08:59.427 --> 01:09:02.513
<i>...strange stories floating
around before we left.</i>

408
01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:06.892
<i>Rumours about something
being dug up on the moon.</i>

409
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:11.439
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

410
01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:15.818
<i>...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

411
01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.696
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

412
01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:20.906
<i>For instance...</i>

413
01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:25.453
<i>...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

414
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.956
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

415
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.542
<i>...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

416
01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:36.839
<i>...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

417
01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:40.259
You working up your crew
psychology report?

418
01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.179
<i>Of course I am.</i>

419
01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:47.350
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

420
01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:49.643
<i>Just a moment.</i>

421
01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.270
<i>Just a moment.</i>

422
01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:57.109
<i>I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

423
01:09:57.818 --> 01:10:02.365
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

424
01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:07.036
-Is it still within operational limits?
-<i>Yes.</i>

425
01:10:07.244 --> 01:10:09.747
<i>And it will stay that way
until it fails.</i>

426
01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.999
We have 72 hours till failure?

427
01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:16.128
<i>Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.</i>

428
01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.549
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

429
01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:24.470
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

430
01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:50.431
CONTROLLER: <i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

432
01:11:53.767 --> 01:11:56.228
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

433
01:11:56.437 --> 01:12:01.567
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

434
01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:06.030
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>

435
01:12:06.238 --> 01:12:07.907
<i>...prior to failure.</i>

436
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.145
BOWMAN:
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

437
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.502
Open the pod doors, Hal.

438
01:19:53.246 --> 01:19:55.874
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

439
01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.168
HAL:
<i>Yes...</i>

440
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.505
<i>...it's puzzling.</i>

441
01:20:02.714 --> 01:20:06.510
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

442
01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.140
<i>I would recommend...</i>

443
01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:16.520
<i>...that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.</i>

444
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:21.108
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

445
01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:25.487
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

446
01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:28.824
<i>...for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

447
01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.293
CONTROLLER: <i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

448
01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:43.213
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

449
01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:47.843
<i>We concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction.</i>

450
01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:50.721
<i>We advise you that
our preliminary findings...</i>

451
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:53.682
<i>...indicate that your on board
9000 computer...</i>

452
01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.101
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

453
01:20:56.309 --> 01:20:59.312
<i>I say again, in error
predicting the fault.</i>

454
01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:04.067
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

455
01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:07.571
<i>...the results from our twin
9000 computer.</i>

456
01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:11.158
<i>We're sceptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

457
01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:14.119
<i>...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

458
01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:15.954
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

459
01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:19.082

463
01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:34.347
No, I'm not, Hal.

464
01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.224
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

465
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:40.145
-Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
-<i>Of course.</i>

466
01:21:41.354 --> 01:21:44.983
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

467
01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:48.820
<i>Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.</i>

468
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:52.365
<i>It can only be
attributable to human error.</i>

469
01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:56.369
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

470
01:21:56.703 --> 01:22:00.165
<i>...and it has always
been due to human error.</i>

471
01:22:03.668 --> 01:22:05.378
Listen, Hal...

472
01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.881
...there's never been
any instance at all...

473
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:11.343
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

474
01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.178
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

475
01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:17.099
<i>The 9000 Series has
a perfect operational record.</i>

476

POOLE: I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but....

477
01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:27.901
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

478
01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:30.112
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

479
01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:34.157
<i>Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.</i>

480
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.831
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

481
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.793
Fine. Thanks very much.

482
01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:50.340
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

483
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:53.176
Would you come down

484
01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:54.511
See you later, Hal.

485
01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:18.160

What sort of trouble are you having?

487
01:23:29.212 --> 01:23:31.923

Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:12.983
Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis.

506
01:25:14.317 --> 01:25:17.570
It certainly indicates his
integrity and self-confidence.

507

510
01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.670
There's no reason not
to put back the unit and...

511
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:38.466
-...carry on with the failure analysis.
-No, no, I agree about that.

Okay. But, look, Dave.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:46.266
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail?

515
01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:49.686
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.
