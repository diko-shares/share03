00:00:06.447 --> 00:00:08.907
(eerie music)

2
00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:26.424
(thunder crashing)

3
00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:31.805
(gargoyle growling)

4
00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:34.683
{\an8}(thunder crashing)

5
00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:41.148
(eerie music)

6
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:49.365
(wind howling)

7
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.002
(metal creaking)

8
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.301
(eerie music)

9
00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.600
(truck rumbling)

10
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:21.146
(gate crashing)

11
00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:24.733
(truck rumbling)

12
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.131
(tense music)

13
00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:52.261
- [Man] We've only got a
few minutes, guys, let's go.

14
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:54.680
(tense music)

15
00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:01.015
(men shouting orders indistinctly)

16
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:03.521
(tense music)

17
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.252
(men shouting orders indistinctly)

18
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:28.797
- Ah!

19
00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:34.970
- Is it bad tonight?

20
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.346
- Oh, bad?

21
00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:39.224
That's one way to describe it.

22
00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:43.103
Uh, insane seems a
little more appropriate.

23
00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.022
It feels like he's
breathing down my neck, man.

24
00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:47.899
It is my professional opinion

25
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.526
we should get the hell out of here.

26
00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:51.028
Now.

27
00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:51.820
- Noted.

28
00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:57.534
Clean this place up and
then locate our guests.

29
00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.038
- Oh!

30
00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:02.539
(pills clattering)

31
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.332
Ah!

32
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.876
I just need to take the edge off.

33
00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:08.628
- You know the routine.

34
00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.131
I need you clearheaded.

35
00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:12.674
First things first.

36
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.219
(tense music)

37
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.596
Now, where is he?

38
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.684
- Uh...

39
00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:24.937
- [Man] Show me where he's hiding.

40
00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:27.397
(tense music)

41
00:03:30.818 --> 00:03:33.445
(man screaming)

42
00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:40.202
- You son of a bitch!

43
00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:41.995
You said he only killed 9 people.

44
00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:43.789
There's 40 victims here!

45
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.457
- 9 when he was alive.

46
00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:46.875
He's added a few since then.

47
00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.836
Now where is he, Dennis?

48
00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.760
(dramatic music)

49
00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:01.098
All teams go to Alpha.

50
00:04:01.098 --> 00:04:02.682
Bring in the cube!

51
00:04:02.683 --> 00:04:05.769
(dramatic music)

52
00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.270
- So how'd this guy get
this name, "The Breaker?"

53
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.773
What is he, a truck driver?

54
00:04:09.773 --> 00:04:11.107
- Simple folklore.

55
00:04:11.108 --> 00:04:14.736
The local color exorcizing its demons.

56
00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:16.196
Or maybe it's because he broke his victims

57
00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:17.071
into as many pieces as possible.

58
00:04:17.072 --> 00:04:17.906
(car crashes)

59
00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:20.910
(Dennis shouting)

60
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.536
I hate being rushed.

61
00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.247
- This one isn't like the others.

62
00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:26.539
- Then I'll give you a bonus.

63
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.333
- You don't have that kind of money.

64
00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.918
- After tonight you'll be surprised.

65
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.087
Now, get to work.

66
00:04:32.087 --> 00:04:34.798
(dramatic music)

67
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.761
Careful, Dennis!

68
00:04:40.971 --> 00:04:42.764
Don't... get too curious.

69
00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:46.560
- No!

70
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.769
Son of a bitch!

71
00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.899
How can you possibly justify
what you're doing, Cyrus?

72
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.483
It's out and out slavery!

73
00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:55.611
- I'll give you this,
Damon, you are persistent.

74
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:57.070
And what about you, Kalina?

75
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:01.241
Still carrying around those
ridiculous quicksilver flares?

76
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:03.326
You still have that quaint magical book?

77
00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:05.412
- These aren't animals you're capturing!

78
00:05:05.412 --> 00:05:07.122
They're human beings!

79
00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:08.790
- They are dead human beings.

80
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.334
Maybe you should join Greenpeace.

81
00:05:10.334 --> 00:05:12.669
Throw blood on old women's furs.

82
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.962
(Cyrus laughs)

83
00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:14.880
(Kalina spits)

84
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.007
- Who are you to play God?

85
00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:19.843
- Playing is for children.

86
00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:21.886
- You'll never pull it off.

87
00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:24.264
Not without the right spells.

88
00:05:24.264 --> 00:05:26.099
That, and the thirteenth ghost.

89
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.392
- The thirteenth ghost?

90
00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.395
- Get them out of my sight!

91
00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:30.396
We've wasted too much time already.

92
00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:31.230
- [Man] All right, let's go!

93
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.397
Move!

94
00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.274
- Why'd he say thirteenth?

95
00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:36.901
- Move the cube into position.

96
00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:39.070
- What's he talking about, 13 ghosts?

97
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.073
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!

98
00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:43.033
The Breaker is 12!

99
00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:44.993
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus!

100
00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.122
- Yes, 12 and then one more.

101
00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:49.414
I thought you were psychic!

102
00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.417
- That's not how it works and you know it!

103
00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:54.211
- There's no time to argue.

104
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:55.921
Release the bait!

105
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:56.796
- What bait?

106
00:05:56.797 --> 00:05:59.508
We never needed bait before!

107
00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:02.219
(truck rumbling)

108
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.931
(dramatic music)

109
00:06:11.895 --> 00:06:13.396
- A truck full of blood?

110
00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:15.899
You've got to be shitting me.

111
00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:18.610
(dramatic music)

112
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.402
Oh, boy!

113
00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:23.323
(blood splashing)

114
00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:26.076
- Now.

115
00:06:27.327 --> 00:06:29.662
Power up the cube.

116
00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:32.290
(switch clicks)

117
00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:38.046
Start transmitting.

118
00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:43.259
(recorded voice chanting)

119
00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:06.784
(dramatic music)

120
00:07:08.535 --> 00:07:09.327
Come.

121
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:11.913
Come.

122
00:07:13.207 --> 00:07:14.791
Come!

123
00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:17.920
(mysterious voice laughing)

124
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.754
(cars crashing)

125
00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:21.131
(man screaming)

126
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:22.340
- Oh, God!

127
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.675
Help me!

128
00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.386
Help me! (screaming)

129
00:07:26.386 --> 00:07:27.428
(door bangs shut)

130
00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:31.474
(mysterious voice whispering
in foreign language)

131
00:07:31.475 --> 00:07:32.350
- Oh, shit!

132
00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:35.353
Ah!

133
00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.146
God!

134
00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:41.568
(bones breaking)

135
00:07:41.568 --> 00:07:43.152
- No!

136
00:07:43.153 --> 00:07:43.987
(cars crashing)

137
00:07:43.987 --> 00:07:47.448
(Dennis shouts)

138
00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:49.909
(man screams)

139
00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:54.080
(car crashes)

140
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.499
(Dennis shouts)

141
00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:59.127
(mysterious voice laughing)

142
00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:04.215
(dramatic music)

143
00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:06.760
(men shouting)

144
00:08:11.932 --> 00:08:13.850
(cars crashing)

145
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:16.395
(men shouting)

146
00:08:19.273 --> 00:08:21.483
(dramatic music)

147
00:08:21.483 --> 00:08:23.860
(man grunts)

148
00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:27.947
- [Man] No!

149
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.827
(man screaming)

150
00:08:36.623 --> 00:08:38.082
- Hey, hey!

151
00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.167
Put him down!

152
00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:39.960
Hey! Hey!

153
00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:44.590
(dramatic music)

154
00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:49.343
Ah! (breathing heavily)

155
00:08:53.807 --> 00:08:55.517
Hey, Cyrus.

156
00:08:55.517 --> 00:08:56.476
I hope you're happy.

157
00:08:56.476 --> 00:08:57.518
You've got your 12 now.

158
00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.311
- Help me!

159
00:08:59.313 --> 00:09:00.188
He's dying!

160
00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:01.982
Hang on, Damon!

161
00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:02.816
Somebody help!

162
00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:04.651
God damn you, Cyrus!

163
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:06.694
Somebody help me, please!

164
00:09:08.322 --> 00:09:09.156
Help me!

165
00:09:09.156 --> 00:09:09.990
Do something!

166
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.782
- Oh.

167
00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:14.327
Oh.

168
00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:16.496
Oh.

169
00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:20.125
Oh, Cyrus.

170
00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.419
Oh, God.

171
00:09:25.547 --> 00:09:26.839
Oh, Cyrus, oh...

172
00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:33.680
- [Child] Swing me!

173
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.889
- [Girl] Come on, Bobby.

174
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.724
- [Bobby] Come on, Kathy!

175
00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:37.225
Faster!

176
00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:39.102
- [Kathy] Here, let me get your arms.

177
00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:40.812
- Come on, Kathy, try to drag me.

178
00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:42.230
- You're the best little brother!

179
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:43.398
{\an8}- Oh, I love you.

180
00:09:43.398 --> 00:09:44.357
{\an8}Come on, let's go!

181
00:09:44.358 --> 00:09:45.650
{\an8}- Come on.

182
00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:46.485
{\an8}- I'm going to get you!

183
00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.029
I'm going to get you! (laughs)

184
00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:50.321
Let's play, come on!

185
00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:51.156
- Kathy!

186
00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:52.365
- [Man] Look at those two.

187
00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:53.200
She's got him on the run now,

188
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.284
but before you know it,

189
00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:55.493
he's going to be picking her up

190
00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:58.246
and throwing her over his shoulder.

191
00:09:58.247 --> 00:10:00.499
- They're perfect.

192
00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:01.333
- Watch, watch them.

193
00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.208
Watch them.

194
00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:04.544
(woman laughs)

195
00:10:04.544 --> 00:10:05.419
- They really love this place.

196
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.964
(man laughing)

197
00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:13.220
(gentle music)

198
00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.306
- I love you, you know that?

199
00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:17.181
- [Group] Surprise!

200
00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:19.976
(man laughing)

201
00:10:19.977 --> 00:10:20.811
{\an8}- [Man] Ah, my heart!

202
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:21.645
{\an8}My heart!

203
00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:22.479
{\an8}- [Kathy] Happy birthday, Dad!

204
00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:23.313
{\an8}- [Bobby] Happy birthday!

205
00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:24.856
{\an8}- [Kathy] Happy birthday!

206
00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:26.732
- [Woman] Happy birthday, Arthur.

207
00:10:26.733 --> 00:10:28.359
- [Bobby] Dad, here's my present.

208
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.944
- [Kathy] We love you! Make a wish!

209
00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:30.779
Blow out the candles.

210
00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:32.906
(woman laughing)

211
00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:34.699
What did you wish for?

212
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.534
- [Woman] I love you.

213
00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:37.118
- [Arthur] Ah, I love you, too.

214
00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:40.163
(fire alarm beeping)

215
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:44.292
- [Woman] What's that?

216
00:10:44.293 --> 00:10:45.669
Why is the smoke alarm on?

217
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:46.586
- [Arthur] It's the fire alarm.

218
00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:48.087
I'll get the kids, you
call the fire department.

219
00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:49.547
- [Bobby] Dad! Help, Mom!

220
00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:50.924
- [Woman] Get the kids.

221
00:10:50.924 --> 00:10:51.966
- [Children] Mom! Dad!

222
00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:53.218
- [Woman] Get the kids!

223
00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:54.052
- [Bobby] Mom!

224
00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:54.886
Dad! Help me!

225
00:10:54.886 --> 00:10:55.720
(blaring sirens approaching)

226
00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:56.555
- [Kathy] Dad, come on!

227
00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:57.514
- [Arthur] Where's your mom?

228
00:10:57.514 --> 00:10:58.348
Where is she?

229
00:10:58.348 --> 00:10:59.932
- [Kathy] I don't know where Mom is!

230
00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:01.809
Bobby, come on, we have to get out!

231
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.852
Oh, my God!

232
00:11:02.853 --> 00:11:03.812
- [Arthur] Jean!

233
00:11:03.812 --> 00:11:04.687
Jean!

234
00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:06.398
- [Kathy] Mom's still in the house.

235
00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:07.899
{\an8}Dad, we can't leave her here!

236
00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:08.733
{\an8}- [Bobby] Mom!

237
00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:09.568
{\an8}- [Arthur] Jean!

238
00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:10.402
{\an8}- [Kathy] Bobby, go outside!

239
00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:11.236
Just wait outside now!

240
00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.153
- [Arthur] Jean!

241
00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:14.030
- [Man] You can't go back in there, sir.

242
00:11:14.031 --> 00:11:17.284
(dramatic music)

243
00:11:17.284 --> 00:11:20.912
(hospital monitors beeping)

244
00:11:21.788 --> 00:11:23.372
- [Man] I'm sorry, sir.

245
00:11:23.373 --> 00:11:25.083
She didn't make it.

246
00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:28.211
- [Arthur] I should have gone back in.

247
00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:32.131
(dramatic music)

248
00:11:32.132 --> 00:11:33.633
{\an8}- [Priest] We are gathered here today

249
00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:36.510
{\an8}to honor the memory and
life's work of Jean Kriticos,

250
00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:37.762
{\an8}(Arthur sobs)

251
00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:40.766
a devoted mother and loving wife

252
00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:44.102
who was too quickly taken from this life.

253
00:11:44.102 --> 00:11:48.602
Jean, you will be forever
missed, but never forgotten.

254
00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:50.358
- [Kathy] I miss you, Mom.

255
00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:52.652
- [Bobby] I miss you, Mom.

256
00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:56.989
- [Kathy] God, why did
you have to leave us?

257
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.741
I can't do this without you.

258
00:11:58.742 --> 00:12:00.535
- [Bobby] I don't want you to go.

259
00:12:00.535 --> 00:12:03.538
- God, Mom, I love you so much.

260
00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:05.248
Please watch over us.

261
00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:09.002
{\an8}I'll love you always.

262
00:12:10.337 --> 00:12:13.048
(dramatic music)

263
00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.305
Dad, it's...

264
00:12:22.099 --> 00:12:24.434
Um, it's almost 8:30.

265
00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:26.978
Shake a leg or you'll
miss your first class.

266
00:12:26.978 --> 00:12:29.021
- Today on "Death in America,"

267
00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:32.942
cancer rates are down,
but suicide is sky-high.

268
00:12:32.943 --> 00:12:34.069
We have a special treat for you today.

269
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:35.070
(kettle whistling)

270
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.239
A body was found this
morning dec-olop-olated.

271
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.449
- Hey, hey, hey.

272
00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:40.408
Decapitated.

273
00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:43.661
- Bobby, honey, find a healthier hobby.

274
00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:46.706
- Leave me alone, you guys, I'm recording.

275
00:12:46.706 --> 00:12:48.249
- 'Morning, everybody.

276
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.961
Mm, something smells interesting.

277
00:12:51.878 --> 00:12:55.089
- Dad they found a guy without
a head behind Dunkin' Donuts.

278
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.383
- Oh, I love Dunkin' Donuts.

279
00:12:59.094 --> 00:12:59.886
- [Kathy] Ow, shit!

280
00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:00.803
- Kathy, Kathy.

281
00:13:00.804 --> 00:13:03.306
Why don't you let Maggie
make the breakfast for once?

282
00:13:03.306 --> 00:13:05.558
Honey, that's why we hired her.

283
00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:07.644
- Dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?

284
00:13:07.644 --> 00:13:09.395
- Well, yeah, just that one time.

285
00:13:09.396 --> 00:13:11.272
- Hey, I heard that.

286
00:13:11.273 --> 00:13:12.107
Hell, I cook better than you.

287
00:13:12.107 --> 00:13:13.316
(tense music)

288
00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:15.609
- [Arthur] Look, we have to
try to get along here, okay?

289
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.944
- [Kathy] (sighs) Okay.

290
00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:18.112
- Dad, will you tell Kathy

291
00:13:18.113 --> 00:13:21.241
that keeping a record of death is healthy?

292
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:22.075
- Kathy...

293
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:23.201
- [Both] Keeping a record
of death is healthy.

294
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:24.410
- Yeah, yeah.

295
00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.079
- Because she's being
a real slut about it.

296
00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:27.663
- Bobby!
(Arthur chokes)

297
00:13:27.664 --> 00:13:29.916
Don't call your sister a slut.

298
00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:31.292
- Thank you, Maggie.

299
00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:33.420
- I prefer the term bitch.

300
00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:36.130
See, sluts are girls with loose sex...

301
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:37.966
- Hey, ho, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,

302
00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:38.800
did you do your homework?

303
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.634
Because Mr. Peterson's been...

304
00:13:39.634 --> 00:13:40.426
Ah!

305
00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:42.345
Damn it!

306
00:13:42.345 --> 00:13:43.512
Bobby that's the third time

307
00:13:43.513 --> 00:13:45.848
I've tripped on that stupid scooter!

308
00:13:45.849 --> 00:13:47.433
- Sorry.

309
00:13:47.434 --> 00:13:48.893
- If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem.

310
00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.563
- Well, we don't have a
big place anymore, do we?

311
00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:53.022
It's the best I can do for now,

312
00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:57.193
so let's just all try and
keep our shit off the floor.

313
00:13:57.194 --> 00:13:58.028
All right?

314
00:13:58.028 --> 00:14:00.655
Now, Bobby, put away
the damn tape recorder.

315
00:14:00.655 --> 00:14:01.739
Can you do that for me?

316
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.950
And get ready for school.

317
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.661
- [Bobby] I'm sorry, Dad.

318
00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:07.787
(knocking at door)

319
00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:09.246
- Ah, God!

320
00:14:09.247 --> 00:14:10.122
Must be the lawyer.

321
00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:10.957
I forgot.

322
00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:12.291
- Lawyer? What lawyer?

323
00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:13.918
I thought our credit was all cleaned up.

324
00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:17.589
- No, no, I don't think it's about that.

325
00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:20.383
- Dad, they won't make
us move again, will they?

326
00:14:20.383 --> 00:14:21.425
- It's gonna be all right.

327
00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:24.303
Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.

328
00:14:25.222 --> 00:14:26.139
- Mr. Kriticos?

329
00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:27.682
- That's right and you're uh?

330
00:14:27.682 --> 00:14:28.724
- I'm Ben Moss.

331
00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:29.559
- Moss.

332
00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:30.393
- How do you do?

333
00:14:30.393 --> 00:14:31.352
- Please, come in.

334
00:14:31.353 --> 00:14:33.313
- Is uh, now a good time, or...

335
00:14:33.313 --> 00:14:35.898
- Ah, as good a time as any.

336
00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:39.360
Please, just give me one minute, will you?

337
00:14:40.278 --> 00:14:41.988
(door creaks)

338
00:14:41.988 --> 00:14:42.822
Okay.

339
00:14:42.822 --> 00:14:44.406
Sorry, I'm ready.

340
00:14:44.407 --> 00:14:48.327
- Uh, I represent the estate
of your uncle, Cyrus Kriticos.

341
00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:50.705
- We have an Uncle Cyrus?

342
00:14:50.705 --> 00:14:51.831
- Uh, had.

343
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:54.750
I uh, only met him a
couple of times as a kid.

344
00:14:54.751 --> 00:14:56.711
He wasn't too popular.

345
00:14:56.711 --> 00:14:59.171
My dad said he squandered
the family fortune.

346
00:14:59.172 --> 00:15:00.923
- We have a family fortune?

347
00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:03.426
- Well, no, Cyrus squandered it.

348
00:15:03.426 --> 00:15:04.844
- Hey, Bobby, isn't that great?

349
00:15:04.844 --> 00:15:06.136
You got a late uncle.

350
00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:07.388
- What is he late for?

351
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:08.390
- His next birthday.

352
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.558
- You mean he's dead?

353
00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:12.143
- [Kathy] Now we get his attention.

354
00:15:12.143 --> 00:15:12.977
- [Arthur] Pipe down.

355
00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:15.063
- Cyrus recorded this
message six weeks ago.

356
00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:16.022
He asked that it be played for you

357
00:15:16.022 --> 00:15:18.649
in the event of his death.

358
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.818
(key clicks)

359
00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:23.279
(tense music)

360
00:15:27.242 --> 00:15:28.034
- Arthur.

361
00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:31.954
It's good to talk to you.

362
00:15:31.955 --> 00:15:33.998
Sadly, if you're watching this now,

363
00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.251
it means I am no longer among the living.

364
00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:39.295
Happily, that makes you and your family

365
00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:41.089
my sole beneficiaries.

366
00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:43.716
I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss,

367
00:15:43.717 --> 00:15:46.302
to deliver the essential elements

368
00:15:46.303 --> 00:15:48.722
in my last will and testament.

369
00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:51.015
Give it to them, Ben.

370
00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:53.476
(tense music)

371
00:15:56.313 --> 00:15:57.814
- A key?

372
00:15:57.814 --> 00:15:59.565
- A key to what?

373
00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:01.276
- A key to your new house.

374
00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:02.068
- What?

375
00:16:03.153 --> 00:16:06.781
- This house is the
fruit of my life's work.

376
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:09.075
- Bathrooms.

377
00:16:09.075 --> 00:16:09.909
Bathrooms!

378
00:16:09.909 --> 00:16:11.410
Everyone gets their own bathrooms!

379
00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:12.495
- Is this for real?

380
00:16:12.495 --> 00:16:15.247
- It is a one of a kind home.

381
00:16:15.248 --> 00:16:17.124
It's my home, actually.

382
00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:19.919
My home.

383
00:16:21.087 --> 00:16:22.671
I have no complaints.

384
00:16:22.672 --> 00:16:24.882
I've led an interesting life.

385
00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.468
I have seen some amazing things.

386
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.972
But the only regret I have

387
00:16:31.973 --> 00:16:35.393
is that I never got to
know my nephew, Arthur,

388
00:16:35.393 --> 00:16:38.562
nor appreciate the love
of a family like you have.

389
00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:39.397
- Dad!

390
00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:43.275
- This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

391
00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:45.278
Enjoy.

392
00:16:48.948 --> 00:16:50.908
Perhaps we'll meet again

393
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.452
in another life.

394
00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:57.874
(computer buzzes)

395
00:16:57.874 --> 00:16:58.708
- Wow!

396
00:16:58.708 --> 00:17:00.042
- When can we see it?

397
00:17:00.043 --> 00:17:02.003
- The house is yours whenever you like.

398
00:17:02.003 --> 00:17:03.379
Actually, I'm heading up there after work.

399
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.423
If you want, you, your
wife, and kids can...

400
00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:06.257
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

401
00:17:06.257 --> 00:17:07.091
Time out.

402
00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.051
I am not the missus here.

403
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:09.761
- Uh, my wife, uh...

404
00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:13.014
(stammering) My wife is...

405
00:17:13.014 --> 00:17:15.016
- Our mom got burned to death in a fire.

406
00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:15.850
- Bobby!

407
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:16.684
- What?

408
00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:18.144
It's true.

409
00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:20.563
- That's enough, Robert.

410
00:17:20.563 --> 00:17:25.063
Mr. Moss, uh, just exactly
where is this place?

411
00:17:25.193 --> 00:17:27.320
- [Moss] Just a couple
hours drive from here.

412
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.239
A town called Willow
Grove, just up the parkway.

413
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.492
It's in a gorgeous area,
but I have to warn you,

414
00:17:32.492 --> 00:17:34.410
your uncle liked his privacy.

415
00:17:34.411 --> 00:17:36.830
There isn't a neighbor for miles.

416
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.081
- [Maggie] Come on, hurry up.

417
00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:39.665
- S-U-F...

418
00:17:41.418 --> 00:17:42.460
Suffocate!

419
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.294
I got it!

420
00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:44.128
I win!

421
00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.380
- Ah, so what, so what?

422
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.339
You think you're so slick.

423
00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:49.633
- Come on, you guys, we're almost there.

424
00:17:51.594 --> 00:17:52.970
- Excited?

425
00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:53.805
- Yeah.

426
00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:55.264
Mom would have freaked over this.

427
00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:56.140
- Oh, yeah.

428
00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:01.104
Looks like things are
starting to get better.

429
00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:02.230
Right?

430
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.022

484
00:19:54.008 --> 00:19:55.384
It's about time somebody showed up.

485
00:19:55.385 --> 00:19:56.219
Is this your place?

486
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:57.053
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:19:57.053 --> 00:19:57.887
Who are you?

488
00:19:57.887 --> 00:19:59.513
- I'm the power guy.

489
00:20:00.723 --> 00:20:02.391
Ah, don't touch.

490
00:20:02.392 --> 00:20:03.643
Look, you probably don't know this,

491
00:20:03.643 --> 00:20:05.144
but your house is knocking out the power

492
00:20:05.144 --> 00:20:06.770
of the whole tri-quad area.

493
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:09.148
I need to get inside
and check the breakers.

494
00:20:09.148 --> 00:20:10.149
- Could you come back tomorrow?

495
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:11.900
Is that maybe a possibility?

496
00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:12.735
- Oh, tomorrow?

497
00:20:12.735 --> 00:20:13.569
- Yeah.

498
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.404
- Let me see.

499
00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:17.573
Oh, there's about 5570 houses
right now without power.

500
00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:19.534
My bosses kind of frown on that, so...

501
00:20:19.534 --> 00:20:23.788
- Right, well, that's not
really our problem, is it?

502
00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:27.708
- Look, buddy, I've been doing
this job about three weeks.

503
00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:30.253
Is there any way you can
give me a break here?

504
00:20:30.253 --> 00:20:31.629
- Sure.

505
00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:32.504
No problem.

506
00:20:34.424 --> 00:20:36.801
- (loudly) Thank you!

507
00:20:36.801 --> 00:20:38.052
Mr.?

508
00:20:38.052 --> 00:20:40.345
- Kriticos, Arthur Kriticos.

509
00:20:41.973 --> 00:20:43.808
- It's quite a place you got.

510
00:20:43.808 --> 00:20:44.642
- Yeah.

511
00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:45.476
- Yeah!

512
00:20:45.476 --> 00:20:47.060
We're moving in.

513
00:20:47.061 --> 00:20:49.271
- Well, one step at a time.

514
00:20:51.774 --> 00:20:54.193
(lock clicks)

515
00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.575
(mechanism starts ticking)

516
00:21:07.081 --> 00:21:07.998
- [Kathy] That's odd.

517
00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.084
- Dad, you broke it.

518
00:21:10.084 --> 00:21:12.336
- Bobby, give it a rest.

519
00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:15.631
(mechanism clicking on)

520
00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:17.591
- Hello.

521
00:21:18.885 --> 00:21:22.013
- [Bobby] Wow, you can
see right through it.

522
00:21:22.013 --> 00:21:22.847
- Huh.

523
00:21:22.847 --> 00:21:24.932
You guys couldn't afford any walls?

524
00:21:24.933 --> 00:21:26.643
- How weird.

525
00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:30.521
- Guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't
too keen on privacy.

526
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:34.316
- I sure hope the
bathroom's in the basement.

527
00:21:34.317 --> 00:21:37.361
(mechanism cranking)

528
00:21:41.658 --> 00:21:45.161
(dramatic music)

529
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:45.953
- Oho!

530
00:21:48.498 --> 00:21:51.209
(dramatic music)

531
00:22:15.108 --> 00:22:17.693
- [Bobby] It's like a fun house.

532
00:22:18.987 --> 00:22:20.029
- It's Latin.

533
00:22:22.782 --> 00:22:25.493
(dramatic music)

534
00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:33.709
- Everything's so beautiful.

535
00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:37.380
- Uh, family, just so we all clear,

536
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.132
Miss Maggie does not do windows, okay?

537
00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:40.925
- Wow!

538
00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:44.345
(gentle music)

539
00:22:47.807 --> 00:22:51.185
- What an incredible wealth of knowledge.

540
00:22:53.646 --> 00:22:55.189
- [Bobby] A samurai sword!

541
00:22:55.189 --> 00:22:56.356
- Bobby,

542
00:22:56.357 --> 00:22:57.983
in your dreams, pal.

543
00:23:01.362 --> 00:23:03.781
- Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.

544
00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:06.492
- Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

545
00:23:07.368 --> 00:23:09.828
(tense music)

546
00:23:15.084 --> 00:23:16.043
- Oh, Cyrus.

547
00:23:17.253 --> 00:23:21.048
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?

548
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:23.509
(tense music)

549
00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:38.940
- Goodness.

550
00:23:38.941 --> 00:23:40.734
It's like a cathedral.

551
00:23:42.111 --> 00:23:45.739
- All right, first rule:
No throwing stones.

552
00:23:46.741 --> 00:23:50.035
- It's marvelous, though, isn't it?

553
00:23:50.036 --> 00:23:51.746
A living work of art.

554
00:23:56.918 --> 00:23:59.045
- The sooner you show me
where you hid the basement,

555
00:23:59.045 --> 00:24:02.757
the sooner I can get 
my ass out of here.

556
00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:04.383
- I believe it's down the hall.

557
00:24:04.383 --> 00:24:06.676
It's two doors on the right.

558
00:24:09.972 --> 00:24:11.682
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

559
00:24:16.062 --> 00:24:19.273
- [Arthur] The construction is amazing.

560
00:24:21.442 --> 00:24:23.735
- I'm getting dizzy.

561
00:24:23.736 --> 00:24:26.155
(tense music)

562
00:24:27.073 --> 00:24:28.282
- Bobby!

563
00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:29.992
Don't touch anything.

564
00:24:31.452 --> 00:24:32.244
Okay?

565
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.041
At least until we get
some property insurance.

566
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:39.501
- Arthur, we've got some
papers to sign in the library.

567
00:24:39.502 --> 00:24:40.878
After that, I would love
to take you and your family

568
00:24:40.878 --> 00:24:42.379
on a tour of the house.

569
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.339
- Great, great.

570
00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:46.592
I don't want you guys
to move from this spot.

571
00:24:46.592 --> 00:24:47.759
We'll be right back.

572
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.471
- Dad, you're being
paranoid and overprotective.

573
00:24:50.471 --> 00:24:53.098
- Yeah, of all this stuff.

574
00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:54.725
I know you guys too well.

575
00:24:54.725 --> 00:24:56.017
Stay right here.

576
00:24:58.396 --> 00:24:59.146
I mean it.

577
00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:02.149
(Kathy stomps)

578
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.942
Huh?

579
00:25:03.985 --> 00:25:06.779
(Kathy whistling)

580
00:25:12.034 --> 00:25:14.453
(tense music)

581
00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:24.087
- What the...

582
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.550
(eerie music)

583
00:25:42.523 --> 00:25:45.567
Where'd you hide your money, old man?

584
00:25:46.777 --> 00:25:49.237
(eerie music)

585
00:25:54.202 --> 00:25:56.996
(Dennis groaning)

586
00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:00.416
Oh, shit!

587
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:03.877
What the hell was that?

588
00:26:06.255 --> 00:26:07.047
Oh!

589
00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:11.427
Oh, no.

590
00:26:13.387 --> 00:26:14.179
Oh, Cyrus.

591
00:26:16.265 --> 00:26:17.766
- Oh!

592
00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:20.770
All right, now I know I'm dreaming.

593
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:21.562
Okay.

594
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.731
Was Cyrus a hunter?

595
00:26:24.732 --> 00:26:26.483
- You could say that.

596
00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:30.984
Oh, your uncle was quite a
collector of many things, he...

597
00:26:31.197 --> 00:26:33.741
(tense music)

598
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:34.575
- Oh!

599
00:26:34.575 --> 00:26:35.701
(tense music)

600
00:26:35.701 --> 00:26:38.495
(Dennis groans)

601
00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:40.623
- I've marked where you're
supposed to sign, Arthur.

602
00:26:40.623 --> 00:26:41.457
Right here would be great.

603
00:26:41.457 --> 00:26:43.000
- Okay, look, uh...

604
00:26:44.168 --> 00:26:46.253
I didn't want to bring this
up in front of the kids,

605
00:26:46.254 --> 00:26:47.046
But uh...

606
00:26:48.965 --> 00:26:51.842
Well, this place is beyond amazing.

607
00:26:52.969 --> 00:26:55.763
(Dennis groaning)

608
00:26:58.266 --> 00:27:01.102
- I'm just a math teacher and uh,

609
00:27:01.102 --> 00:27:03.562
the taxes alone must be...

610
00:27:03.562 --> 00:27:06.356
I have nothing set aside and uh...

611
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.071
Well, to be honest, a
fire took away everything.

612
00:27:12.071 --> 00:27:15.074
- Arthur, you don't need to worry.

613
00:27:15.074 --> 00:27:18.202
Cyrus was a genius when
it came to finances.

614
00:27:18.202 --> 00:27:20.621
Basically, you and your
family don't ever have to

615
00:27:20.621 --> 00:27:22.497
worry about money again.

616
00:27:22.498 --> 00:27:25.292
(Dennis groaning)

617
00:27:26.627 --> 00:27:27.961
- You son of a bitch.

618
00:27:27.962 --> 00:27:30.422
(eerie music)

619
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.891
(Dennis groaning)

620
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:43.810
(eerie music)

621
00:27:43.811 --> 00:27:46.605
(Dennis groaning)

622
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:51.151
(eerie music)

623
00:28:01.704 --> 00:28:04.498
(Dennis shouting)

624
00:28:11.797 --> 00:28:14.591
(ghosts laughing)

625
00:28:15.801 --> 00:28:18.512
(Dennis screams)

626
00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:24.351
- Oho!

627
00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:26.353
Lookie here.

628
00:28:26.354 --> 00:28:27.313
Look, y'all!

629
00:28:28.272 --> 00:28:30.649
Look, look, look, look, look!

630
00:28:32.693 --> 00:28:34.027
- [Bobby] Whoa!

631
00:28:34.028 --> 00:28:35.487
- [Maggie] Whoa, Bobby!

632
00:28:35.488 --> 00:28:38.240
(gentle music)

633
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.032
- Sign.

634
00:28:41.452 --> 00:28:42.870
- Arthur?

635
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:43.662
Arthur?

636
00:28:44.663 --> 00:28:46.831
Arthur, we gotta...

637
00:28:46.832 --> 00:28:49.042
Arthur, we have to talk.

638
00:28:49.043 --> 00:28:51.045
- What is the deal with the breakers?

639
00:28:51.045 --> 00:28:52.046
- There's nothing wrong with the breakers.

640
00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:54.131
I'm not the power guy.

641
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:55.549
My name is Dennis Rafkin.

642
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:56.591
- [Moss] You're Dennis Rafkin?

643
00:28:56.592 --> 00:28:57.593
- Who's Dennis Rafkin?

644
00:28:57.593 --> 00:28:59.511
- My office warned me
about this guy, Arthur...

645
00:28:59.512 --> 00:29:00.346
- I know that it's gonna
sound completely whacked,

646
00:29:00.346 --> 00:29:02.556
all right, but just stay with me.

647
00:29:02.556 --> 00:29:07.056
I used to hunt displaced spiritual
energies with your uncle.

648
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.354
- I'm sorry?

649
00:29:08.354 --> 00:29:10.397
- Uh, uh, PK agents.

650
00:29:10.398 --> 00:29:13.067
Revenants, uh, like, wraiths.

651
00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:13.901
Wraiths.

652
00:29:13.901 --> 00:29:15.152
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

653
00:29:15.152 --> 00:29:17.279
- Uh. (laughs nervously)

654
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:18.488
- That's okay, that's okay.

655
00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:20.574
I'll do this the easy way: ghosts.

656
00:29:20.574 --> 00:29:22.826
Arthur, I used to...

657
00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:26.455
I used to hunt ghosts
with your Uncle Cyrus.

658
00:29:27.998 --> 00:29:28.873
- Goats?

659
00:29:28.874 --> 00:29:29.791
- Ghosts!

660
00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:30.959
Ghosts, goddamn it!

661
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.378
Listen to me!

662
00:29:32.378 --> 00:29:33.962
- Race you to the end of the hall.

663
00:29:33.963 --> 00:29:37.132
- Uh-uh, Bobby, I don't
think this is the place for...

664
00:29:37.133 --> 00:29:38.551
Come on, slowpoke, what you doing?

665
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:40.094
I know that ain't the best you got, man.

666
00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:41.512
My grandma scoot better than that.

667
00:29:41.512 --> 00:29:42.679
You're like a girl.

668
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.224
- Ghosts as in, as in,

669
00:29:45.224 --> 00:29:47.100
as in disgruntled
spirits trapped on Earth.

670
00:29:47.101 --> 00:29:47.935
Ghosts, you know?

671
00:29:47.935 --> 00:29:48.769
- Ghosts right.

672
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:49.686
- As in Halloween. Boo!

673
00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:51.605
As in Demi Moore and
"Unchained Melody," right?

674
00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:52.439
Ghosts.

675
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.232
- Ghosts. Right.

676
00:29:53.232 --> 00:29:54.107
Okay, I get it.

677
00:29:54.108 --> 00:29:54.942
I get it, I'm scared.

678
00:29:54.942 --> 00:29:56.276
(Moss laughing)
I'm scared.

679
00:29:56.277 --> 00:29:57.111
- Don't laugh at me.

680
00:29:57.111 --> 00:29:58.070
Don't laugh.

681
00:29:59.488 --> 00:30:01.323
Look, I'll explain everything
as soon as you get you

682
00:30:01.323 --> 00:30:03.450
and your children outside.

683
00:30:05.161 --> 00:30:05.995
- [Maggie] What's taking you so long?

684
00:30:05.995 --> 00:30:06.829
- [Bobby] Out of my way.

685
00:30:06.829 --> 00:30:07.663
- [Maggie] I don't think
scouting is your game, boy.

686
00:30:07.663 --> 00:30:08.955
- [Bobby] Come on, Maggie.

687
00:30:08.956 --> 00:30:09.790
- [Maggie] I won.

688
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:10.624
- Oh, you cheated!

689
00:30:10.624 --> 00:30:12.709
That wasn't fair, I didn't get a start.

690
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.336
- Got to be on your toes, man.

691
00:30:14.336 --> 00:30:16.296
- This has to be my room!

692
00:30:16.297 --> 00:30:18.424
There are toys everywhere.

693
00:30:18.424 --> 00:30:19.758
- Wonder what my room's gonna look like.

694
00:30:19.758 --> 00:30:22.260
- [Bobby] I'm now entering
the coolest room in the house.

695
00:30:22.261 --> 00:30:25.305
(mechanism whirring)

696
00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:30.936
- I'll be in here. (laughs)

697
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.360
(Kathy sighs)

698
00:30:40.613 --> 00:30:41.905
(dramatic music)

699
00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:42.698
Wow.

700
00:30:43.866 --> 00:30:45.659
This place is awesome!

701
00:30:47.703 --> 00:30:51.039
- Look, Cyrus has containment
cubes all over the basement

702
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.374
and I don't know why they're here,

703
00:30:52.374 --> 00:30:53.958
I don't know why he brought 'em here

704
00:30:53.959 --> 00:30:56.503
and I am not staying around to find out!

705
00:30:56.504 --> 00:30:57.588
So if I were you...

706
00:30:57.588 --> 00:30:59.423
- Well, he isn't you.

707
00:30:59.423 --> 00:31:01.299
This guy has been harassing my office

708
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.926
since your uncle died, okay?

709
00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.887
I see this all the time, Arthur.

710
00:31:04.887 --> 00:31:06.471
Some rich guy passes away

711
00:31:06.472 --> 00:31:09.349
and then all the nuts come out!

712
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.267
The next thing you know he'll be claiming

713
00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:11.935
that Cyrus owed him money or...

714
00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:12.811
- He did owe me money!

715
00:31:12.811 --> 00:31:15.563
He owed me a shitload of money!

716
00:31:15.564 --> 00:31:19.317
- These are some funky looking specs here.

717
00:31:19.318 --> 00:31:20.319
Hmm.

718
00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:21.153
What do you think?

719
00:31:21.153 --> 00:31:22.320
I look cool or what?

720
00:31:22.321 --> 00:31:23.280
- Let me see!

721
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.155
- Ah! Not so fast.

722
00:31:24.156 --> 00:31:25.824
You gotta cater to my ego first.

723
00:31:25.824 --> 00:31:27.700
Maggie is the best
babysitter you've ever had.

724
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:28.660
- Come on!

725
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:29.495
- [Maggie] All right.

726
00:31:29.495 --> 00:31:32.664
- I'm getting my ass out
of the big glass house!

727
00:31:32.665 --> 00:31:36.126
Grab your children, do the same!

728
00:31:36.126 --> 00:31:36.960
(Dennis groans)

729
00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:37.920
- Are you all right?

730
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.631
(dramatic music)

731
00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:43.216
(Jean screaming)

732
00:31:43.217 --> 00:31:45.677
(eerie music)

733
00:31:46.887 --> 00:31:49.264
(Jean screaming)

734
00:31:49.265 --> 00:31:50.099
Jean!

735
00:31:50.099 --> 00:31:50.933
Jean!

736
00:31:50.933 --> 00:31:51.767
Jean!

737
00:31:51.767 --> 00:31:52.559
- No!

738
00:31:54.228 --> 00:31:56.230
- We're gonna get you some help, okay?

739
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.397
We're gonna get you some help.

740
00:31:57.398 --> 00:31:59.024
- Don't touch me.

741
00:31:59.024 --> 00:32:01.735
(dramatic music)

742
00:32:06.115 --> 00:32:07.699
(Kathy gasps)

743
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.742
- Oh, my God!

744
00:32:17.334 --> 00:32:18.752
(sniffs) Mm!

745
00:32:18.752 --> 00:32:20.378
We have struck gold.

746
00:32:21.463 --> 00:32:22.297
- [Arthur] Easy.

747
00:32:22.298 --> 00:32:23.090
- Don't.

748
00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:33.142
- Okay.

749
00:32:33.142 --> 00:32:34.434
How's your head?

750
00:32:35.644 --> 00:32:36.519
- Not good.

751
00:32:39.106 --> 00:32:40.857
Where's the suit?

752
00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:43.318
(eerie music)

753
00:32:52.369 --> 00:32:53.912
- Power guy.

754
00:32:53.912 --> 00:32:54.704
Idiot.

755
00:32:55.914 --> 00:32:56.956
- Whoa, cool!

756
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.086
- Better have a pair of those in my room.

757
00:33:01.086 --> 00:33:02.921
Hey, Bobby, where you going?

758
00:33:02.921 --> 00:33:05.381
(eerie music)

759
00:33:07.134 --> 00:33:08.260
- What are you staring at?

760
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.012
(eerie music)

761
00:33:11.013 --> 00:33:11.888
Hey, kiddo.

762
00:33:13.724 --> 00:33:15.684
He thinks I'm gonna duck.

763
00:33:15.684 --> 00:33:16.643
Hey.

764
00:33:16.644 --> 00:33:17.519
Nice tits.

765
00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.770
(scary music)

766
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:20.063
Oh, geez!

767
00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:21.398
You!

768
00:33:21.398 --> 00:33:22.816
What's the matter, honey?

769
00:33:22.816 --> 00:33:24.359
Bad representation?

770
00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:26.236
(button clicks)

771
00:33:26.236 --> 00:33:29.280
(mechanism whirring)

772
00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:38.040
(dramatic music)

773
00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.544
(lever bangs)

774
00:33:42.544 --> 00:33:45.004
(tense music)

775
00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:52.054
Hello!

776
00:33:52.054 --> 00:33:53.889
Not bad for an hourly wage.

777
00:33:53.889 --> 00:33:56.933
(mechanism whirring)

778
00:33:58.686 --> 00:34:01.397
(tense music)

779
00:34:01.397 --> 00:34:04.817
(windows shuttering)

780
00:34:04.817 --> 00:34:06.652
- It's time to leave.

781
00:34:06.652 --> 00:34:09.821
- I'll take your word for it.

782
00:34:09.822 --> 00:34:10.656
(mechanism whirring)

783
00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:12.157
Kathy?

784
00:34:12.157 --> 00:34:16.035
(mechanism whirring)

785
00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:19.122
(tense music)

786
00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:20.624
- Come on, this way.

787
00:34:20.624 --> 00:34:23.084
(tense music)

788
00:34:24.336 --> 00:34:25.170
Shit!

789
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.379
What the hell?

790
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.172
Kathy!

791
00:34:28.465 --> 00:34:29.257
Maggie!

792
00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.301
Bobby!

793
00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:32.719
(doors thudding shut)

794
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.180
(tense music)

795
00:34:38.058 --> 00:34:41.102
(mechanism whirring)

796
00:34:44.189 --> 00:34:46.649
(eerie music)

797
00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:56.075
- Hey.

798
00:34:56.076 --> 00:34:57.744
I uh...

799
00:34:57.745 --> 00:35:00.748
(eerie music)

800
00:35:00.748 --> 00:35:02.875
I was just kidding before.

801
00:35:04.209 --> 00:35:06.044
Little lawyer humor.

802
00:35:06.044 --> 00:35:08.129
(eerie music)

803
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:08.964
(Moss chuckles)

804
00:35:08.964 --> 00:35:11.341
(walls slam)

805
00:35:16.889 --> 00:35:19.349
(eerie music)

806
00:35:21.935 --> 00:35:25.521
(glasses clatter)

807
00:35:25.522 --> 00:35:27.982
(eerie music)

808
00:35:29.735 --> 00:35:32.529
(glass squeaking)

809
00:35:41.705 --> 00:35:43.206
- [Arthur] Kathy?

810
00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:44.082
Hey, Bobby!

811
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.042
Kathy?

812
00:35:48.504 --> 00:35:50.088
I don't believe it.

813
00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:51.297
- Believe what?

814
00:35:52.466 --> 00:35:53.550
- Bob...

815
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.511
I told them not to leave this spot.

816
00:35:56.512 --> 00:35:57.679
- They're kids, what do you expect?

817
00:35:57.679 --> 00:35:58.513
- Yeah.

818
00:35:58.514 --> 00:35:59.348
Yeah, thank you, Dr. Phil.

819
00:35:59.348 --> 00:36:01.683
You check downstairs, I'll look up.

820
00:36:01.683 --> 00:36:02.684
Bobby, come on!

821
00:36:02.684 --> 00:36:04.268
It's time to go!

822
00:36:04.269 --> 00:36:06.729
(tense music)

823
00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:13.362
Kathy?

824
00:36:13.362 --> 00:36:14.821
Where are you guys?

825
00:36:14.822 --> 00:36:15.614
Bobby!

826
00:36:16.615 --> 00:36:19.534
(tense music)

827
00:36:19.535 --> 00:36:21.995
- [Mysterious Voice] Bobby.

828
00:36:21.995 --> 00:36:24.455
(Kathy sighs)

829
00:36:27.793 --> 00:36:30.253
(tense music)

830
00:37:00.993 --> 00:37:04.037
(mechanism whirring)

831
00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:16.883
(windows shuttering)

832
00:37:16.884 --> 00:37:19.344
(tense music)

833
00:37:35.193 --> 00:37:37.612
(shower curtain whooshing)

834
00:37:37.613 --> 00:37:40.240
(Kathy giggles)

835
00:37:41.658 --> 00:37:44.118
(eerie music)

836
00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:52.335
(water running)

837
00:37:56.381 --> 00:37:58.841
(eerie music)

838
00:38:30.082 --> 00:38:31.166
(ghost screams)
(pounding at door)

839
00:38:31.166 --> 00:38:31.958
- Kathy!

840
00:38:33.585 --> 00:38:35.211
What are you doing up here?

841
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:37.130
I told you to wait downstairs.

842
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.506
- Yeah, but Dad, come on.

843
00:38:38.507 --> 00:38:40.509
This bathroom's unbelievable!
- Yes.

844
00:38:40.509 --> 00:38:42.219
Yes, great house, beautiful bathroom.

845
00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.763
Now, where is your brother?

846
00:38:44.763 --> 00:38:46.848
- He's with Maggie, I don't...

847
00:38:46.848 --> 00:38:48.850
- Uh, was with Maggie.

848
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.977
We were racing and we
saw all the glass and...

849
00:38:50.978 --> 00:38:52.104
- Oh, that's good.

850
00:38:52.104 --> 00:38:53.563
No, you're supposed to watch him.

851
00:38:53.563 --> 00:38:56.107
See, that's what I pay you for.

852
00:38:57.317 --> 00:38:59.777
(tense music)

853
00:39:01.279 --> 00:39:03.489
(lever clanks)

854
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.700
(mechanism whirring)

855
00:39:05.701 --> 00:39:07.661
- [Ghostly Voice] Bobby.

856
00:39:11.164 --> 00:39:11.956
Down here.

857
00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:14.459
- Maggie?

858
00:39:15.752 --> 00:39:18.004
- [Ghostly Voice] Come on down and play.

859
00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:18.964
- Is that you?

860
00:39:18.964 --> 00:39:21.549
(eerie music)

861
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.093
Maggie!

862
00:39:23.093 --> 00:39:24.636
Stop playing games.

863
00:39:24.636 --> 00:39:25.470
- [Ghostly Voice] Bobby?

864
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:27.847
I have something for you.

865
00:39:27.848 --> 00:39:31.059
We'll have lots of fun, Bobby.

866
00:39:31.059 --> 00:39:33.978
- [Woman's Voice] Don't come down, Bobby.

867
00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:35.188
Stay upstairs.

868
00:39:35.188 --> 00:39:37.940
(woman laughing maniacally)

869
00:39:37.941 --> 00:39:39.317
Don't follow her.

870
00:39:41.486 --> 00:39:44.363
- [Ghostly Voice] Down here, Bobby.

871
00:39:46.033 --> 00:39:49.911
- [Woman's Voice] Bobby,
don't come down, Bobby.

872
00:39:49.911 --> 00:39:51.495
- [Ghostly Voice] Bobby?

873
00:39:51.496 --> 00:39:52.955
Around the corner.

874
00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:56.459
- [Woman's Voice] Don't come down here!

875
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.961
- [Ghostly Voice] That's it, Bobby.

876
00:39:57.961 --> 00:40:01.005
- You guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!

877
00:40:01.006 --> 00:40:02.590
- [Maggie] Bobby!

878
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:03.967
- [Arthur] Bobby!

879
00:40:05.052 --> 00:40:08.180
Okay, I'll find Bobby, but
I want you both out of here.

880
00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.014
- But Dad...

881
00:40:09.014 --> 00:40:09.848
- No buts!

882
00:40:09.848 --> 00:40:11.391
- I want you both to wait in the car

883
00:40:11.391 --> 00:40:13.142
and I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.

884
00:40:13.143 --> 00:40:14.394
- Why are you freaking out?

885
00:40:14.394 --> 00:40:18.064
- Kathy, just this once,
don't argue with me.

886
00:40:19.441 --> 00:40:20.608
- What happened to the door?

887
00:40:20.609 --> 00:40:21.443
- What's going on?

888
00:40:21.443 --> 00:40:22.277
I thought there was a door here.

889
00:40:22.277 --> 00:40:23.861
- Son of a bitch!

890
00:40:23.862 --> 00:40:25.655
I cannot believe this!

891
00:40:25.655 --> 00:40:27.031
I'm going to have to break it down.

892
00:40:27.032 --> 00:40:28.992
All right, back away!

893
00:40:28.992 --> 00:40:31.369
(chair slamming glass)

894
00:40:31.369 --> 00:40:33.621
(chair shattering)

895
00:40:33.622 --> 00:40:34.414
Ah!

896
00:40:35.457 --> 00:40:37.500
- That's quite dramatic,

897
00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:40.545
but you're wasting your
time, it's all sealed up.

898
00:40:40.545 --> 00:40:41.671
- Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?

899
00:40:41.671 --> 00:40:43.214
- Don't go there.

900
00:40:43.215 --> 00:40:45.258
What do you mean, it's all sealed up?

901
00:40:45.258 --> 00:40:48.135
- What part of that code are
you having trouble cracking?

902
00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:50.513
The entire house is sealed up.

903
00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.140
- Well, there must be another way out.

904
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.974
- I've looked.

905
00:40:52.974 --> 00:40:55.476
- Well, we're gonna look again,
right after we find my son.

906
00:40:55.477 --> 00:40:56.311
Now, get up.

907
00:40:56.311 --> 00:40:57.437
- That's all right, I'll wait right here.

908
00:40:57.437 --> 00:40:58.229
- Listen,

909
00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:01.482
I don't know what the
hell is going on here.

910
00:41:01.483 --> 00:41:04.652
I really don't know who the hell you are.

911
00:41:04.653 --> 00:41:06.279
And my son is missing.

912
00:41:06.279 --> 00:41:08.322
So until those questions are answered,

913
00:41:08.323 --> 00:41:10.575
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

914
00:41:10.575 --> 00:41:11.534
Now, get up!

915
00:41:13.078 --> 00:41:14.496
- All right.

916
00:41:14.496 --> 00:41:15.288
Breathe.

917
00:41:20.127 --> 00:41:21.336
- Did the lawyer split?

918
00:41:21.336 --> 00:41:24.380
(mechanism whirring)

919
00:41:29.803 --> 00:41:32.013
- [Ghostly Voice] Bobby.

920
00:41:32.013 --> 00:41:32.805
Bobby.

921
00:41:34.766 --> 00:41:37.685
(woman laughing)

922
00:41:37.686 --> 00:41:40.146
(eerie music)

923
00:41:41.356 --> 00:41:42.148
Bobby.

924
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:45.985
(levers clanking)

925
00:41:50.115 --> 00:41:52.033
(scary music)

926
00:41:52.033 --> 00:41:52.825
Bobby.

927
00:41:54.661 --> 00:41:57.205
(lever clanks)

928
00:42:00.876 --> 00:42:03.336
(tense music)

929
00:42:36.077 --> 00:42:38.454
- Come on, guys, stop hiding!

930
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.296
(eerie music)

931
00:42:46.296 --> 00:42:47.130
- [Maggie] Bobby!

932
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.256
- Come on out now, pal!

933
00:42:48.256 --> 00:42:49.507
- Robert, stop screwing around!

934
00:42:49.507 --> 00:42:52.343
- Hey, glass family Robinson,
you're wasting your breath.

935
00:42:52.344 --> 00:42:53.803
This is Ectobar glass.

936
00:42:53.803 --> 00:42:54.637
He's not gonna hear you.

937
00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:57.432
See, this is shatterproof and soundproof.

938
00:42:57.432 --> 00:42:58.724
- So what are these?

939
00:42:58.725 --> 00:43:01.144
- That's a little harder to explain.

940
00:43:01.144 --> 00:43:02.895
Uh, they're containment spells.

941
00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:04.772
See, ghosts can't cross those.

942
00:43:04.773 --> 00:43:06.316
- Ghosts?

943
00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:07.442
- Yes, ghosts.

944
00:43:08.777 --> 00:43:11.237
- See, the supernatural realm
has its own set of laws.

945
00:43:11.238 --> 00:43:13.365
(Kathy laughs)
For ghosts, it's spells.

946
00:43:13.365 --> 00:43:14.449
Either written or spoken,

947
00:43:14.449 --> 00:43:17.493
ghosts have to obey
whatever the spells say.

948
00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:19.954
(tense music)

949
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:26.711
- [Ghostly Voice] Bobby.

950
00:43:28.588 --> 00:43:31.048
(scary music)

951
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.138
(Bobby screaming)

952
00:43:37.138 --> 00:43:39.807
- [Dennis] The entire basement
is filled with ghosts.

953
00:43:39.808 --> 00:43:41.810
- In this basement?

954
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.144
- Of course, in this basement.

955
00:43:43.144 --> 00:43:43.978
What is it with you people?

956
00:43:43.979 --> 00:43:46.356
If it was next door, I
wouldn't give a shit!

957
00:43:46.356 --> 00:43:48.232
(Bobby screaming)

958
00:43:48.233 --> 00:43:49.359
- [Bobby] Dad!

959
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.444
- I can prove it.

960
00:43:51.444 --> 00:43:52.903
- Hey, I gave a pair of those to Bobby.

961
00:43:52.904 --> 00:43:55.364
(scary music)

962
00:43:58.076 --> 00:43:59.285
- Spectral viewers.

963
00:43:59.286 --> 00:44:00.745
You can see the ghosts with these.

964
00:44:00.745 --> 00:44:02.079
- [Kathy] Bobby, come on.

965
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.914
- [Arthur] Hey, Bobby!

966
00:44:02.914 --> 00:44:03.748
- I don't see any ghosts.

967
00:44:03.748 --> 00:44:05.499
- Because they're locked downstairs.

968
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.710
- (screaming) Dad!

969
00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:10.380
- There's more of this crazy
spell shit on the floor.

970
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.297
- Dad!

971
00:44:11.298 --> 00:44:12.132
- [Kathy] Bobby!

972
00:44:12.132 --> 00:44:13.842
- Let me see those.

973
00:44:13.842 --> 00:44:16.177
(woman laughing maniacally)

974
00:44:16.177 --> 00:44:19.555
(Bobby slams into glass)

975
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:22.142
- Bobby!

976
00:44:22.142 --> 00:44:23.518
Come on out, pal!

977
00:44:24.853 --> 00:44:25.770
- Oh, hidden barrier spells?

978
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:26.854
You gotta be kidding me.

979
00:44:26.855 --> 00:44:27.689
- [Arthur] Bobby!

980
00:44:27.689 --> 00:44:28.648
- Why would he need more protection?

981
00:44:28.648 --> 00:44:30.107
- All right, that's enough.

982
00:44:30.108 --> 00:44:31.818
This is not helping.

983
00:44:31.818 --> 00:44:32.902
I want you to do me a favor

984
00:44:32.902 --> 00:44:35.571
and stop with all the
haunted house nonsense, okay?

985
00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:39.075
At least until we find the kid
and figure a way out of here.

986
00:44:39.075 --> 00:44:40.868
- [Kathy] Bobby, come on.

987
00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:42.078
- [Maggie] I don't know where he could be.

988
00:44:42.078 --> 00:44:45.039
- Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

989
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.832
Wait! No!

990
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.584
What are you doing?

991
00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:48.626
What did I just say?

992
00:44:48.626 --> 00:44:51.003
Did I just say there was
a petting zoo downstairs?

993
00:44:51.004 --> 00:44:52.338
No!

994
00:44:52.339 --> 00:44:54.841
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.

995
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:56.759
- Right, right, right right.

996
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:01.260
But you also said that
they're all locked up.

997
00:45:01.306 --> 00:45:02.098
Right?

998
00:45:03.224 --> 00:45:04.183
- No. No way.

999
00:45:04.184 --> 00:45:05.018
- Now, come here!

1000
00:45:05.018 --> 00:45:05.893
Wait, wait.

1001
00:45:06.853 --> 00:45:07.645
Listen.

1002
00:45:09.272 --> 00:45:12.483
I'll uh, I'll make a deal with you.

1003
00:45:12.484 --> 00:45:15.862
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you

1004
00:45:15.862 --> 00:45:17.405
if you just help me

1005
00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:20.742
find my son.

1006
00:45:22.869 --> 00:45:25.329
(tense music)

1007
00:45:32.212 --> 00:45:35.673
- (scoffs) Unbelievable.

1008
00:45:35.673 --> 00:45:37.508
Get out of my way.

1009
00:45:37.509 --> 00:45:38.301
- Okay.

1010
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.889
(mechanism ticking)

1011
00:45:44.933 --> 00:45:46.893
- [Woman's Voice] Bobby.

1012
00:45:50.063 --> 00:45:51.981
- [Ghostly Voice] Bobby.

1013
00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:56.236
(eerie music)

1014
00:46:02.992 --> 00:46:05.452
- [Woman's Voice] Bobby.

1015
00:46:05.453 --> 00:46:07.621
Get out of the basement.

1016
00:46:07.622 --> 00:46:09.707
You need to go upstairs.

1017
00:46:09.707 --> 00:46:13.001
(eerie music)

1018
00:46:13.002 --> 00:46:15.421
You need to put on those glasses.

1019
00:46:15.422 --> 00:46:17.882
(eerie music)

1020
00:46:18.883 --> 00:46:20.509
- [Ghostly Voice] Bobby.

1021
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.053
- That's it.

1022
00:46:22.053 --> 00:46:23.387
That's a good boy.

1023
00:46:23.388 --> 00:46:25.848
(eerie music)

1024
00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:28.559
Bobby.

1025
00:46:31.938 --> 00:46:32.730
Bobby.

1026
00:46:34.149 --> 00:46:37.485
Go upstairs and find your father.

1027
00:46:37.485 --> 00:46:38.569
- [Bobby] Mom?

1028
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:39.779
- [Jean] Go on!

1029
00:46:41.197 --> 00:46:42.156
Go upstairs!

1030
00:46:46.161 --> 00:46:47.287
Go find Kathy.

1031
00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:49.538
Watch out.

1032
00:46:52.834 --> 00:46:53.668
Watch out.

1033
00:46:53.668 --> 00:46:54.502
(ghost shouts)

1034
00:46:54.502 --> 00:46:55.336
(Bobby screams)

1035
00:46:55.336 --> 00:46:56.170
- [Kathy] Bobby, come on!

1036
00:46:56.171 --> 00:46:57.005
- [Arthur] Bobby!

1037
00:46:57.005 --> 00:46:58.381
- [Maggie] Bobby!

1038
00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:03.010
- You don't have to scream, all right?

1039
00:47:03.011 --> 00:47:03.886
Just chill.

1040
00:47:06.097 --> 00:47:08.557
(tense music)

1041
00:47:23.573 --> 00:47:24.949
Uh, this way.

1042
00:47:24.949 --> 00:47:25.783
- Hold on.

1043
00:47:25.783 --> 00:47:27.576
Hold on, listen to me.

1044
00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:29.745
This is gonna take forever.

1045
00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:32.457
This place is just too big.

1046
00:47:32.457 --> 00:47:34.000
Okay.

1047
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.752
Kathy and I'll head up this way.

1048
00:47:36.753 --> 00:47:37.879
You two check down there.

1049
00:47:37.879 --> 00:47:39.046
- No, I don't think we should split up.

1050
00:47:39.047 --> 00:47:39.964
We should stay together.
- It's okay.

1051
00:47:39.964 --> 00:47:40.756
It's okay.

1052
00:47:41.674 --> 00:47:43.717
Just go in a straight line, turn around.

1053
00:47:43.718 --> 00:47:45.886
We'll meet back here in five.

1054
00:47:45.887 --> 00:47:47.054
- Five.

1055
00:47:47.055 --> 00:47:47.889
- Five minutes.

1056
00:47:47.889 --> 00:47:48.723
- Back here.

1057
00:47:48.723 --> 00:47:49.557
- Okay, go ahead.

1058
00:47:49.557 --> 00:47:50.391
- [Dennis] And don't touch anything!

1059
00:47:50.391 --> 00:47:51.225
- (quietly) I don't want to go with him.

1060
00:47:51.226 --> 00:47:52.101
- Go ahead.

1061
00:47:55.063 --> 00:47:58.107
(mechanism whirring)

1062
00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:04.363
- [Maggie] Wait a second, let's
go back to the ghost thingy.

1063
00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:05.406
- [Dennis] There are
ghosts in the basement.

1064
00:48:05.406 --> 00:48:08.575
If you don't believe me, go
ahead and look for yourself.

1065
00:48:08.576 --> 00:48:10.703
- I told you, I can't see any ghosts.

1066
00:48:10.703 --> 00:48:11.912
- What the hell?

1067
00:48:11.913 --> 00:48:12.872
Give me those.

1068
00:48:12.872 --> 00:48:14.164
Let me see.

1069
00:48:14.165 --> 00:48:16.208
Why are these open?

1070
00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:17.126
I was down here before.

1071
00:48:17.126 --> 00:48:18.919
They weren't open.

1072
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.754
(scary music)

1073
00:48:19.754 --> 00:48:20.796
(Dennis screams)

1074
00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:22.131
Oh, God!

1075
00:48:22.131 --> 00:48:23.674
I hate it when they do that!

1076
00:48:23.675 --> 00:48:24.759
- Do what?

1077
00:48:24.759 --> 00:48:26.177
- They wait for you to stick your face

1078
00:48:26.177 --> 00:48:28.304
right up against the glass

1079
00:48:28.304 --> 00:48:29.888
and then give you a big fat boo!

1080
00:48:29.889 --> 00:48:31.515
(Maggie exclaims)

1081
00:48:31.516 --> 00:48:33.226
- Don't do that!

1082
00:48:33.226 --> 00:48:36.729
(Dennis panting)

1083
00:48:36.729 --> 00:48:37.563
(Maggie gasps)

1084
00:48:37.564 --> 00:48:39.065
- God!

1085
00:48:39.065 --> 00:48:40.983
- You see it?

1086
00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:41.818
- It's, it's...

1087
00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:42.652
- A ghost!

1088
00:48:42.652 --> 00:48:43.486
It's a ghost!

1089
00:48:43.486 --> 00:48:44.487
Just like I've been saying all night!

1090
00:48:44.487 --> 00:48:45.613
Finally, a believer!

1091
00:48:45.613 --> 00:48:47.615
Thank you, oh Lord Jesus.

1092
00:48:47.615 --> 00:48:49.408
There are ghosts around us all the time.

1093
00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:50.785
Most of them, they can't hurt us.

1094
00:48:50.785 --> 00:48:52.161
Most of them don't even want to hurt us.

1095
00:48:52.161 --> 00:48:55.122
A little ghost here, a little
ghost there, no one cares.

1096
00:48:55.123 --> 00:48:57.917
But there are exceptions,
like this bad-ass behind me.

1097
00:48:57.917 --> 00:49:00.920
The ones who die a violent
death stay in a tortured realm

1098
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.130
and so violence is all they know.

1099
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:04.841
- What is he doing?

1100
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:05.925
- I don't know.

1101
00:49:05.925 --> 00:49:06.759
I can't see.

1102
00:49:06.759 --> 00:49:08.761
I don't have the glasses.

1103
00:49:08.761 --> 00:49:11.221
(Dennis screams)

1104
00:49:11.222 --> 00:49:12.431
- Okay, I've had it with this.

1105
00:49:12.432 --> 00:49:13.641
It's time to go now.

1106
00:49:13.641 --> 00:49:14.475
Now!

1107
00:49:14.475 --> 00:49:15.309
- Don't touch me.
- Please!

1108
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:16.144
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.

1109
00:49:16.144 --> 00:49:16.978
- Come on.

1110
00:49:16.978 --> 00:49:17.812
Let's go!

1111
00:49:17.812 --> 00:49:18.813
Will you come on?

1112
00:49:18.813 --> 00:49:21.273
(tense music)

1113
00:49:24.777 --> 00:49:26.653
Come on, ghost boy, move your ass!

1114
00:49:26.654 --> 00:49:27.946
It's time to go!

1115
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.284
- [Kathy] Dad, slow down.

1116
00:49:31.284 --> 00:49:32.118
- [Arthur] Bobby?

1117
00:49:32.118 --> 00:49:34.120
- We're going to get lost.

1118
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.580
(tense music)

1119
00:49:45.423 --> 00:49:48.717
(tape player rewinding)

1120
00:49:52.221 --> 00:49:53.055
(tape player clicks on)

1121
00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:54.849
(Bobby screaming)

1122
00:49:54.849 --> 00:49:57.434
(tape player clicks off)

1123
00:49:57.435 --> 00:49:59.854
(tense music)

1124
00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.608
Dad.

1125
00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:05.651
Listen to me.

1126
00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:08.446
He's gonna be okay.

1127
00:50:09.822 --> 00:50:11.532
We're gonna find him.

1128
00:50:12.492 --> 00:50:14.827
- So ready to leave this place.

1129
00:50:14.827 --> 00:50:15.953
- Oh.

1130
00:50:15.953 --> 00:50:16.870
Oh, boy.

1131
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:17.746
- What?

1132
00:50:17.747 --> 00:50:20.416
- Uh, that's the symbol of The Jackal.

1133
00:50:20.416 --> 00:50:21.708
- [Maggie] What's The Jackal?

1134
00:50:21.709 --> 00:50:23.711
- The Jackal is the
Charlie Manson of ghosts.

1135
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:26.088
And if The Jackal's out, screw the kid.

1136
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:28.841
We've got to get out of this basement.

1137
00:50:28.841 --> 00:50:30.801
- Maybe Rafkin was right.

1138
00:50:30.802 --> 00:50:31.677
I mean, maybe there really are...

1139
00:50:31.678 --> 00:50:32.470
- Kathy!

1140
00:50:34.013 --> 00:50:36.557
Think about what you're saying.

1141
00:50:37.725 --> 00:50:40.352
There's no such thing as ghosts.

1142
00:50:41.354 --> 00:50:43.606
(tense music)

1143
00:50:43.606 --> 00:50:46.400
(Kathy screaming)

1144
00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:53.657
- Kathy!

1145
00:50:53.658 --> 00:50:55.117
(Kathy screaming)

1146
00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:55.910
Kathy!

1147
00:50:57.203 --> 00:50:59.997
(Kathy screaming)

1148
00:51:10.341 --> 00:51:11.175
What is it?

1149
00:51:11.175 --> 00:51:12.050
I can't see it!

1150
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:13.052
Tell me where it is!

1151
00:51:13.052 --> 00:51:14.511
(Kathy screaming)

1152
00:51:14.512 --> 00:51:15.346
Get off!

1153
00:51:15.346 --> 00:51:18.140
(Kathy screaming)

1154
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:18.975
Hold on!

1155
00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:19.892
Stay with me!

1156
00:51:19.892 --> 00:51:22.686
(Kathy screaming)

1157
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.274
- [Kathy] Get off me!

1158
00:51:26.274 --> 00:51:29.277
Get off me! (sobbing)

1159
00:51:29.277 --> 00:51:31.153
(Kathy screaming)

1160
00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:31.988
- Come on, pull!

1161
00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.072
- Who the hell are you?

1162
00:51:33.072 --> 00:51:36.033
- Never mind, just pull, goddammit!

1163
00:51:36.033 --> 00:51:37.367
- Oh, shit!

1164
00:51:37.368 --> 00:51:38.577
Don't, don't speak.

1165
00:51:38.578 --> 00:51:40.121
- Why?
- Don't move.

1166
00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:41.998
- What?

1167
00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:45.376
- Somehow we got behind enemy lines.

1168
00:51:45.376 --> 00:51:47.836
(eerie music)

1169
00:51:50.381 --> 00:51:51.215
(ghost cackling)

1170
00:51:51.215 --> 00:51:52.799
- Oh my God!

1171
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.592
Hurry!

1172
00:51:54.927 --> 00:51:56.303
Please, hurry!

1173
00:51:56.304 --> 00:51:57.680
Please, hurry!

1174
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.640
(ghost cackling)

1175
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.850
- Hey, little guy.

1176
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:02.685
How?

1177
00:52:02.685 --> 00:52:03.894
- I don't think you should
be teasing the ghosts.

1178
00:52:03.895 --> 00:52:04.687
- Will you shut up?

1179
00:52:04.687 --> 00:52:05.521
- You shut up!

1180
00:52:05.521 --> 00:52:08.065
You're the one who keeps pissing 'em off!

1181
00:52:08.065 --> 00:52:09.107
- Go.

1182
00:52:09.108 --> 00:52:10.234
Go, go!

1183
00:52:10.234 --> 00:52:11.068
Go!

1184
00:52:11.068 --> 00:52:13.820
(Kathy screaming)

1185
00:52:15.573 --> 00:52:16.407
Maggie!

1186
00:52:16.407 --> 00:52:17.241
- What?

1187
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:18.700
(eerie music)

1188
00:52:18.701 --> 00:52:19.535
(Kathy crying)

1189
00:52:19.535 --> 00:52:20.744
- Honey?

1190
00:52:20.745 --> 00:52:22.663
- I don't know, just stop it!

1191
00:52:22.663 --> 00:52:23.622
- Where?

1192
00:52:23.623 --> 00:52:26.542
I can't see shit without
the glasses, idiot!

1193
00:52:26.542 --> 00:52:28.043
- Well, I can see

1194
00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:31.255
and I think you should go this way!

1195
00:52:31.255 --> 00:52:32.381
Go, go, go, go, go!

1196
00:52:32.381 --> 00:52:33.590
(Kathy crying)

1197
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:34.383
- Shh.

1198
00:52:35.843 --> 00:52:36.760
It's all right.

1199
00:52:36.761 --> 00:52:38.888
It's all right now, I've got you.

1200
00:52:38.888 --> 00:52:40.222
(Kathy crying)

1201
00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:41.724
Look at me.

1202
00:52:41.724 --> 00:52:43.183
- (crying) Daddy.

1203
00:52:43.184 --> 00:52:44.143
- Okay.

1204
00:52:44.143 --> 00:52:44.935
It's okay.

1205
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.812
All right.

1206
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.148
All right.

1207
00:52:49.148 --> 00:52:49.940
All right.

1208
00:52:51.901 --> 00:52:54.528
(Kathy sobbing)

1209
00:52:55.822 --> 00:52:58.199
Who the hell are you

1210
00:52:58.199 --> 00:53:01.160
and what the hell was that?

1211
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.036
- My name's Kalina Oretzia.

1212
00:53:03.037 --> 00:53:04.913
I'm in the spirit reclamation business.

1213
00:53:04.914 --> 00:53:05.998
- What?

1214
00:53:05.998 --> 00:53:07.457
- I free trapped souls.

1215
00:53:07.458 --> 00:53:08.292
Cyrus has been...

1216
00:53:08.292 --> 00:53:11.712
- Forget Cyrus and trapped
souls for a goddamn second.

1217
00:53:11.712 --> 00:53:14.214
What are you doing here?

1218
00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:17.176
- Looks to me like I'm saving your ass.

1219
00:53:17.176 --> 00:53:18.093
(eerie music)

1220
00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.261
- Oh, my God!

1221
00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.888
It's over there!

1222
00:53:20.888 --> 00:53:21.889
It's still there!

1223
00:53:21.889 --> 00:53:23.849
- Give him your glasses.

1224
00:53:24.809 --> 00:53:25.810
Come on!

1225
00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.521
(Kathy sniffles)

1226
00:53:34.652 --> 00:53:37.112
(eerie music)

1227
00:53:40.199 --> 00:53:41.241
- Oh, my God.

1228
00:53:42.159 --> 00:53:44.286
(eerie music)

1229
00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:46.038
Unbelievable.

1230
00:53:46.038 --> 00:53:48.915
- Another one of Cyrus's victims.

1231
00:53:48.916 --> 00:53:52.044
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.

1232
00:53:53.212 --> 00:53:54.671
- Victims?

1233
00:53:54.672 --> 00:53:57.174
- Cyrus had a nasty
habit of enslaving souls.

1234
00:53:57.174 --> 00:53:58.008
That's why I'm here.

1235
00:53:58.009 --> 00:54:00.344
I intend to set them all free.

1236
00:54:00.344 --> 00:54:02.220
- Listen to me.

1237
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:05.098
I need to know how you got in here.

1238
00:54:06.934 --> 00:54:09.895
- I slipped through an opening
in the house when it shifted.

1239
00:54:09.896 --> 00:54:10.730
- An opening where?

1240
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:11.939
- Don't get your hopes
up, it's closed now.

1241
00:54:11.939 --> 00:54:14.191
It's not gonna happen again.

1242
00:54:14.191 --> 00:54:15.901
Let me show you.

1243
00:54:15.902 --> 00:54:17.486
This is the Arcanum.

1244
00:54:17.486 --> 00:54:19.779
Many people died in the
quest for this book.

1245
00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.947
It was written in the 15th Century

1246
00:54:20.948 --> 00:54:23.158
by an astrologer named Basileus.

1247
00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:26.287
In it, he describes the
making of a certain machine,

1248
00:54:26.287 --> 00:54:28.789
one that can see into the future.

1249
00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:31.875
He wrote it while he was
under demonic possession.

1250
00:54:31.876 --> 00:54:34.128
I can't believe Cyrus built it.

1251
00:54:34.128 --> 00:54:35.629
- [Arthur] Built what?

1252
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:37.715
What are you talking about?

1253
00:54:37.715 --> 00:54:39.466
- Basileus's device.

1254
00:54:39.467 --> 00:54:42.553
We're in the middle of a
machine designed by the devil

1255
00:54:42.553 --> 00:54:44.846
and powered by the dead.

1256
00:54:44.847 --> 00:54:46.056
- Listen to me.

1257
00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:50.478
I don't really give a
shit about any machine

1258
00:54:50.478 --> 00:54:53.814
or devil or Basileus or anything

1259
00:54:53.814 --> 00:54:57.651
except getting my family
the hell out of this place.

1260
00:54:57.652 --> 00:55:01.614
- I came here to set the
souls in this house free.

1261
00:55:01.614 --> 00:55:04.825
You want help, you gotta help me first.

1262
00:55:06.285 --> 00:55:08.578
- Kathy, can you walk?

1263
00:55:08.579 --> 00:55:09.496
Kathy!

1264
00:55:09.497 --> 00:55:10.873
Kathy?

1265
00:55:10.873 --> 00:55:12.749
Kathy! Oh, no!

1266
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.209
This can't be happening!

1267
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.252
- Come on, we've got to get out of here.

1268
00:55:15.252 --> 00:55:17.087
- I'm not going anywhere without my kids.

1269
00:55:17.088 --> 00:55:19.131
- Try telling him that.

1270
00:55:19.131 --> 00:55:21.591
(eerie music)

1271
00:55:25.846 --> 00:55:26.638
Come on.

1272
00:55:27.765 --> 00:55:31.059
(eerie music)

1273
00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.104
(mechanism whirring)

1274
00:55:35.523 --> 00:55:37.983
(windows shuttering)

1275
00:55:37.984 --> 00:55:38.943
- This way.

1276
00:55:38.943 --> 00:55:42.404
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1277
00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:43.948
Stairs!

1278
00:55:43.948 --> 00:55:44.740
Let's go.

1279
00:55:45.616 --> 00:55:46.450
Come on!

1280
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:47.284
Go, go, go!

1281
00:55:47.284 --> 00:55:49.995
You go, go, go, go, go!

1282
00:55:49.996 --> 00:55:50.830
(Maggie exclaims)

1283
00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:51.664
- No, don't touch me!

1284
00:55:51.664 --> 00:55:52.498
(glasses clatter)

1285
00:55:52.498 --> 00:55:54.082
The glasses, quick, the glasses!

1286
00:55:54.083 --> 00:55:54.917
You'll need these!

1287
00:55:54.917 --> 00:55:55.709
Catch!

1288
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.004
(Dennis grunts)

1289
00:55:59.005 --> 00:56:01.465
(mechanism whirring)

1290
00:56:01.465 --> 00:56:03.925
(tense music)

1291
00:56:06.303 --> 00:56:07.512
Good job.

1292
00:56:07.513 --> 00:56:08.889
- Sorry.

1293
00:56:08.889 --> 00:56:10.807
(mechanism whirring)

1294
00:56:10.808 --> 00:56:13.769
(window shuttering)

1295
00:56:15.896 --> 00:56:18.315
- Oh, perfect, another dead end.

1296
00:56:18.315 --> 00:56:20.233
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.

1297
00:56:20.234 --> 00:56:21.235
How do we get to them?

1298
00:56:21.235 --> 00:56:22.444
- (quietly) Get away.

1299
00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:23.279
- What?

1300
00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.113
What do we do now?

1301
00:56:24.113 --> 00:56:24.947
- Get away.

1302
00:56:24.947 --> 00:56:25.781
Get away from the glass.

1303
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:26.615
- Why?

1304
00:56:26.615 --> 00:56:27.449
- Just do it.

1305
00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:30.411
(suspenseful music)

1306
00:56:36.083 --> 00:56:39.461
(ghost growling)

1307
00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.172
(ghost cackling)

1308
00:56:41.172 --> 00:56:43.632
(scary music)

1309
00:56:46.343 --> 00:56:49.137
(Dennis groaning)

1310
00:56:51.724 --> 00:56:52.725
- The glasses.

1311
00:56:52.725 --> 00:56:54.476
(Dennis groaning)

1312
00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:55.728
(tense music)

1313
00:56:55.728 --> 00:56:56.729
(Dennis groaning)

1314
00:56:56.729 --> 00:56:57.521
- No!

1315
00:56:58.773 --> 00:57:00.024
Duck!

1316
00:57:00.024 --> 00:57:00.858
- What?

1317
00:57:00.858 --> 00:57:01.692
- Move!
- Where?

1318
00:57:01.692 --> 00:57:02.526
- [Maggie] Go left!

1319
00:57:02.526 --> 00:57:03.818
- Do something, for Christ's sake!

1320
00:57:03.819 --> 00:57:05.779
We're running out of corridors here!

1321
00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.572
- Duck!

1322
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:08.365
All right, move!

1323
00:57:08.365 --> 00:57:09.199
(Dennis shouting)

1324
00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.910
(mechanism whirring)

1325
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.286
It's there, move!

1326
00:57:13.954 --> 00:57:17.374
(glass slamming)

1327
00:57:17.374 --> 00:57:18.291
- Here it is, here it is.

1328
00:57:18.292 --> 00:57:19.251
We've got to get to the library.

1329
00:57:19.251 --> 00:57:21.294
It's got spell protection all around it.

1330
00:57:21.295 --> 00:57:22.129
- Okay.

1331
00:57:22.129 --> 00:57:24.089
Where is that from here?

1332
00:57:26.175 --> 00:57:28.635
(tense music)

1333
00:57:35.935 --> 00:57:38.228
- [Dennis] Come on, come on.

1334
00:57:42.066 --> 00:57:45.069
- Can I rely on you not to get me killed?

1335
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:47.196
- I guarantee nothing.

1336
00:57:47.196 --> 00:57:49.990
(flare crackling)

1337
00:57:52.034 --> 00:57:54.494
(tense music)

1338
00:58:00.668 --> 00:58:01.669
- [Maggie] See anything?

1339
00:58:01.669 --> 00:58:02.461
- Shh.

1340
00:58:06.173 --> 00:58:07.007
- [Maggie] Anything?

1341
00:58:07.007 --> 00:58:08.550
- No.

1342
00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:10.052
- [Maggie] Okay.

1343
00:58:10.052 --> 00:58:10.969
- Come on.

1344
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:11.929
- [Maggie] Okay.

1345
00:58:11.929 --> 00:58:14.890
- You know, I think
they're just downstairs.

1346
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:18.143
(tense music)

1347
00:58:18.144 --> 00:58:18.936
Nothing.

1348
00:58:22.606 --> 00:58:23.815
- Man, if we get out of this alive,

1349
00:58:23.816 --> 00:58:26.109
I've got to get a pay raise.

1350
00:58:27.903 --> 00:58:29.946
- That's a big if.

1351
00:58:29.947 --> 00:58:32.407
(Kalina straining)

1352
00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.284
- Give me the flare.

1353
00:58:34.285 --> 00:58:35.369
- Ah!

1354
00:58:35.369 --> 00:58:36.787
Oh...

1355
00:58:36.787 --> 00:58:38.663
- What's wrong?

1356
00:58:38.664 --> 00:58:40.082
Come on, man, don't
start freaking out now.

1357
00:58:40.082 --> 00:58:40.916
Come on.

1358
00:58:40.916 --> 00:58:43.126
(flare crackling)

1359
00:58:43.127 --> 00:58:43.919
Okay.

1360
00:58:46.088 --> 00:58:48.548
(eerie music)

1361
00:58:49.842 --> 00:58:50.676
What?

1362
00:58:50.676 --> 00:58:51.677
- Shh.

1363
00:58:51.677 --> 00:58:54.554
(eerie music)

1364
00:58:54.555 --> 00:58:55.389
- Okay, what?

1365
00:58:55.389 --> 00:58:57.015
- Shut up.

1366
00:58:57.016 --> 00:58:58.434
- Give me the book.

1367
00:58:58.434 --> 00:59:00.477
(eerie music)

1368
00:59:00.477 --> 00:59:02.061
(Kalina grunts)

1369
00:59:02.062 --> 00:59:05.940
- Just back up. (chuckles nervously)

1370
00:59:05.941 --> 00:59:06.775
Go slow.

1371
00:59:06.775 --> 00:59:07.984
- Okay, okay.

1372
00:59:07.985 --> 00:59:08.819
I'm going slow.

1373
00:59:08.819 --> 00:59:09.611
- Slow.

1374
00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.072
- Go! Go! Go fast!

1375
00:59:15.117 --> 00:59:17.369
(Dennis and Maggie screaming)

1376
00:59:17.369 --> 00:59:18.203
- What the hell?

1377
00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:19.038
- Who the hell?

1378
00:59:19.038 --> 00:59:20.873
- What the hell are you doing here?

1379
00:59:20.873 --> 00:59:24.585
(mechanism whirring)

1380
00:59:24.585 --> 00:59:27.129
(lever clanks)

1381
00:59:28.172 --> 00:59:29.047
- Ah, shit!

1382
00:59:30.925 --> 00:59:33.260
(ghost growling)

1383
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.636
Hey, remember me?

1384
00:59:35.554 --> 00:59:36.388
- Arthur!
- Get him!

1385
00:59:36.388 --> 00:59:38.515
Get him, get him, get him!

1386
00:59:40.684 --> 00:59:42.602
(sparks sizzling)

1387
00:59:42.603 --> 00:59:43.812
Get him up!

1388
00:59:43.812 --> 00:59:45.772
- Thanks for taking your time.

1389
00:59:45.773 --> 00:59:47.149
- We've got to move down the hall.

1390
00:59:47.149 --> 00:59:48.150
We're gonna make a left and then a right.

1391
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.984
- Where are we going?

1392
00:59:48.984 --> 00:59:50.402
- Trust me, okay?

1393
00:59:50.402 --> 00:59:51.236
- Oh, Arthur?

1394
00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:52.154
- Trust her, just trust her.

1395
00:59:52.154 --> 00:59:52.988
- All right, we're going,

1396
00:59:52.988 --> 00:59:54.155
let's go!
- Let's go!

1397
00:59:54.156 --> 00:59:54.990
- Who the hell is she?

1398
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:57.242
- I'll explain her later.

1399
00:59:57.243 --> 01:00:00.204
(mechanism ticking)

1400
01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:05.125
(tense music)

1401
01:00:13.425 --> 01:00:16.219
(ghost shrieking)

1402
01:00:18.597 --> 01:00:21.057
(tense music)

1403
01:00:55.092 --> 01:00:57.886
(flare crackling)

1404
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.893
Arthur, what happened to Kathy?

1405
01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:06.394
- I don't know, she disappeared.

1406
01:01:06.395 --> 01:01:10.690
- How do you lose an entire
family in a glass house?

1407
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:15.320
(Dennis groans)

1408
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:17.781
(scary music)

1409
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.534
(Arthur shouts)

1410
01:01:20.534 --> 01:01:21.326
Arthur!

1411
01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:24.830
(Arthur screaming)

1412
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:25.914
- Kalina, give me the flare!

1413
01:01:25.914 --> 01:01:28.791
(Arthur screaming)

1414
01:01:32.838 --> 01:01:33.797
- [Maggie] Arthur!

1415
01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:34.631
- Get him!

1416
01:01:34.631 --> 01:01:35.465
Go] go! go!

1417
01:01:35.466 --> 01:01:36.425
Arthur, get up!

1418
01:01:36.425 --> 01:01:38.009
This is not the time to be a girl!

1419
01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.928
Run, run, run, run, go!

1420
01:01:39.928 --> 01:01:41.346
Stop dragging your ass!

1421
01:01:41.347 --> 01:01:43.807
(tense music)

1422
01:01:44.892 --> 01:01:46.476
Go, go, go, go!

1423
01:01:46.477 --> 01:01:48.020
Now is not the time to sit around, Arthur!

1424
01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.354
Run!

1425
01:01:49.355 --> 01:01:50.189
Get the door!

1426
01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:51.023
Go, go, go!

1427
01:01:51.023 --> 01:01:53.650
(ghost wailing)

1428
01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.194
(Dennis panting)

1429
01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.989
- [Maggie] Arthur, are you all right?

1430
01:01:58.989 --> 01:02:01.491
God, I don't wanna be here.

1431
01:02:01.492 --> 01:02:02.743
Fucking ghosts!

1432
01:02:02.743 --> 01:02:04.786
- I hate this job.

1433
01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.246
- They don't seem to like you, either.

1434
01:02:06.246 --> 01:02:07.288
I wonder why.

1435
01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:10.792
(glasses clatter)

1436
01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.377
- You got something to say, say it.

1437
01:02:12.378 --> 01:02:13.796
- All right, let's start with

1438
01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.881
this is all your goddamn fault!

1439
01:02:15.881 --> 01:02:16.715
If you hadn't caught them,

1440
01:02:16.715 --> 01:02:18.466
we wouldn't be running
from them now, would we?

1441
01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:20.469
- It's his uncle that
built the damn house!

1442
01:02:20.469 --> 01:02:22.137
- Yeah, but you helped him!

1443
01:02:22.137 --> 01:02:26.637
How could you help him without
knowing what he was doing?

1444
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:30.645
- I had my reasons.

1445
01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:31.772
- Money, you parasite!

1446
01:02:31.772 --> 01:02:34.357
You stole people's souls for money!

1447
01:02:34.358 --> 01:02:35.901
How depraved is that?

1448
01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:39.070
- If you haven't noticed,
I'm a little bit of a freak!

1449
01:02:39.071 --> 01:02:42.365
I come within 10 feet of anything
dead, I go into seizures.

1450
01:02:42.366 --> 01:02:44.785
I touch somebody and a
whole life full of shit

1451
01:02:44.785 --> 01:02:47.662
just flashes in front of my eyes.

1452
01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.414
All right, so yeah, I'm depraved.

1453
01:02:49.415 --> 01:02:52.000
And Cyrus was my friend
and he accepted me, so...

1454
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.459
(Kalina laughs)

1455
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.586
- He didn't accept you.

1456
01:02:54.586 --> 01:02:56.504
You're so pathetic!

1457
01:02:56.505 --> 01:02:57.923
He used you!

1458
01:02:57.923 --> 01:02:59.841
- Shut up, both of you.

1459
01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.510
Cut him some slack, would you?

1460
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.887
What difference does it make?

1461
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.849
- You didn't tell him, did you?

1462
01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:08.684
- Oh, God, what?

1463
01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.519
Tell me what? What now?

1464
01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:12.646
- About the fourth ghost.

1465
01:03:12.646 --> 01:03:14.981
(dramatic music)

1466
01:03:14.982 --> 01:03:15.857
- No, don't do this.

1467
01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:16.692
I didn't tell him.

1468
01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:17.526
Don't do this.

1469
01:03:17.526 --> 01:03:19.528
- He has a right to know!

1470
01:03:21.989 --> 01:03:24.866
- What about the fourth ghost?

1471
01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.535
- St. Luke's Hospital.

1472
01:03:26.535 --> 01:03:27.744
Six months ago.

1473
01:03:29.455 --> 01:03:32.166
(dramatic music)

1474
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.091
- You're saying my wife's spirit

1475
01:03:41.091 --> 01:03:43.134
is trapped in this house?

1476
01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:47.305
- I didn't know you.

1477
01:03:48.474 --> 01:03:49.349
I didn't know her.

1478
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:52.018
I didn't know she had a husband.

1479
01:03:52.019 --> 01:03:55.063
(Arthur shouts)

1480
01:03:55.063 --> 01:03:56.189
- Why?

1481
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.066
In God's name, why?

1482
01:03:58.066 --> 01:03:59.358
Tell me, why her?

1483
01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:00.401
- I don't know why!

1484
01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:02.362
Cyrus handpicked them
all, including your wife.

1485
01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:03.404
When I figured out who you were,

1486
01:04:03.405 --> 01:04:04.906
God, I've been trying to help you.

1487
01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.575
- You call this help?

1488
01:04:06.575 --> 01:04:07.617
She's right!

1489
01:04:07.618 --> 01:04:09.870
This is all your goddamn fault!

1490
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:11.329
Son of a bitch!

1491
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.122
- Arthur.

1492
01:04:13.707 --> 01:04:15.625
You can save her

1493
01:04:15.626 --> 01:04:16.918
and your kids, too.

1494
01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.630
Just listen to me and believe me.

1495
01:04:20.714 --> 01:04:22.841
This house is not a house.

1496
01:04:24.384 --> 01:04:25.676
It is a machine.

1497
01:04:27.721 --> 01:04:30.473
It is a complete and faithful recreation

1498
01:04:30.474 --> 01:04:32.392
of Basileus's design.

1499
01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:33.684
According to this,

1500
01:04:33.685 --> 01:04:36.354
there should be 12 earthbound
spirits trapped inside.

1501
01:04:36.355 --> 01:04:37.898
See these?

1502
01:04:37.898 --> 01:04:39.816
They represent the Black Zodiac.

1503
01:04:39.816 --> 01:04:42.568
They represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

1504
01:04:42.569 --> 01:04:44.153
The Firstborn Son.

1505
01:04:44.154 --> 01:04:47.031
- [Firstborn Son] I want to play.

1506
01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:48.074
- The Torso.

1507
01:04:48.075 --> 01:04:51.161
(ghost screaming)

1508
01:04:51.161 --> 01:04:52.370
The Bound Woman.

1509
01:04:52.371 --> 01:04:55.290
(ghost cackling)

1510
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:56.833
The Withered Lover.

1511
01:04:58.544 --> 01:04:59.336
Jean.

1512
01:05:00.546 --> 01:05:03.006
(tense music)

1513
01:05:06.134 --> 01:05:07.677
- [Jean] Bobby.

1514
01:05:07.678 --> 01:05:08.553
I love you.

1515
01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:12.015
- The Torn Prince.

1516
01:05:12.015 --> 01:05:15.309
(eerie music)

1517
01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:17.061
The Angry Princess.

1518
01:05:17.062 --> 01:05:18.980
(eerie music)

1519
01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.065
The Pilgrimess.

1520
01:05:20.065 --> 01:05:21.941
(eerie music)

1521
01:05:21.942 --> 01:05:24.027
The Great Child and The Dire Mother.

1522
01:05:24.027 --> 01:05:26.279
(eerie music)

1523
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.155
The Hammer.

1524
01:05:28.699 --> 01:05:30.534
(ghost growling)

1525
01:05:30.534 --> 01:05:34.871
And here, the sign of
Hell's Winter: The Jackal.

1526
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:37.206
(ghost shrieking)

1527
01:05:37.207 --> 01:05:38.541
And the Juggernaut.

1528
01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:41.336
(eerie music)

1529
01:05:41.336 --> 01:05:43.796
According to Basileus, the
machine required the energy

1530
01:05:43.797 --> 01:05:46.883
of these specific spirits in
order to bring it to life.

1531
01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:50.136
Once it engages, the spirits
are released one by one.

1532
01:05:50.137 --> 01:05:52.264
The house then draws them to its center.

1533
01:05:52.264 --> 01:05:56.764
Each one adds its energy to
the machine, powering it up.

1534
01:05:57.352 --> 01:05:59.312
- Powering it up for what?

1535
01:05:59.313 --> 01:06:01.315
- To open the Ocularis Infernum.

1536
01:06:01.315 --> 01:06:03.233
- The Ocularis? What's that?

1537
01:06:03.233 --> 01:06:04.734
- It's Latin.

1538
01:06:04.735 --> 01:06:05.527
Ocularis.

1539
01:06:06.486 --> 01:06:07.778
The Eye of Hell?

1540
01:06:08.655 --> 01:06:10.156
(dramatic music)

1541
01:06:10.157 --> 01:06:11.158
- Very good.

1542
01:06:11.158 --> 01:06:12.325
- The Eye of Hell.

1543
01:06:12.326 --> 01:06:14.077
I'm stuck in here in a glass house

1544
01:06:14.077 --> 01:06:14.911
with a bunch of crazy white people.

1545
01:06:14.911 --> 01:06:16.537
- Go on, go on.

1546
01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:18.831
- In Hell there is an
Eye that sees everything,

1547
01:06:18.832 --> 01:06:20.792
the past and the future, Heaven and Earth,

1548
01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:22.710
the blessed and the damned.

1549
01:06:22.711 --> 01:06:24.838
If knowledge is power,

1550
01:06:24.838 --> 01:06:26.256
then the man who controls the Ocularis

1551
01:06:26.256 --> 01:06:30.093
would be the most powerful man on Earth.

1552
01:06:30.093 --> 01:06:31.302
Your uncle.

1553
01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:32.554
- (chuckles) Great!

1554
01:06:32.554 --> 01:06:33.930
- Ah.

1555
01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:37.224
- So how many ghosts have been set free?

1556
01:06:39.603 --> 01:06:40.437
- 11.

1557
01:06:40.437 --> 01:06:41.980
And the house needs 12.

1558
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.231
- No.

1559
01:06:43.231 --> 01:06:46.150
Damon said something about 13.

1560
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:48.111
That there are 13 ghosts.

1561
01:06:48.111 --> 01:06:50.863
- The thirteenth ghost is a fail-safe.

1562
01:06:50.864 --> 01:06:52.198
In order to stop the process,

1563
01:06:52.199 --> 01:06:55.869
the house needs a sacrifice
of life instead of death.

1564
01:06:55.869 --> 01:06:58.079
A willing, human sacrifice.

1565
01:06:59.539 --> 01:07:01.874
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

1566
01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:05.336
The only ghost to be created
out of an act of pure love.

1567
01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:07.797
- You're the thirteenth ghost.

1568
01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:11.843
- The thirteenth spirit
stands before the Eye

1569
01:07:11.843 --> 01:07:13.427
at the final configuration.

1570
01:07:13.428 --> 01:07:16.722
As the Eye opens, the spirit
uses the power of life

1571
01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:19.225
to essentially short circuit the system.

1572
01:07:19.226 --> 01:07:21.978
- Uses the power of life how?

1573
01:07:21.978 --> 01:07:23.813
- By leaping into the Eye.

1574
01:07:23.814 --> 01:07:25.732
- And Arthur's supposed to take this leap?

1575
01:07:25.732 --> 01:07:27.275
No fuckin' way, lady.

1576
01:07:27.275 --> 01:07:28.651
That's suicide, Arthur.

1577
01:07:28.652 --> 01:07:29.944
I'm not gonna let you do it.

1578
01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.237
You need to come with something else.

1579
01:07:31.238 --> 01:07:32.155
That's, mm-mm.

1580
01:07:32.155 --> 01:07:33.030
That's not working.

1581
01:07:33.031 --> 01:07:34.490
No way.

1582
01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:36.993
- Love is the most
powerful energy, Arthur.

1583
01:07:36.993 --> 01:07:37.785
- Meaning?

1584
01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.872
- In order for you to save your children,

1585
01:07:40.872 --> 01:07:44.250
you'd have to trade your life for theirs.

1586
01:07:45.168 --> 01:07:46.210
- No, no, no.

1587
01:07:47.754 --> 01:07:49.839
Let me see this.

1588
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.260
No, there's got to be a better way.

1589
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.886
I don't read Latin!

1590
01:07:54.886 --> 01:07:56.429
- Well, we can try it
the old fashioned way,

1591
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:58.390
my personal favorite.

1592
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:01.017
But nobody's gonna be here
to brag about it afterwards.

1593
01:08:01.017 --> 01:08:02.435
Whatever we decide,
we've got to come up with

1594
01:08:02.436 --> 01:08:04.980
a game plan soon 'cause
time's running out.

1595
01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.940
- [Maggie] You gonna blow the place up?

1596
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.108
- The last ghost is about to be released.

1597
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:11.653
- Look, I know why you feel
you have to do this, Arthur.

1598
01:08:11.653 --> 01:08:12.779
- Get away from me.

1599
01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:14.071
- No, psychics call it a linking.

1600
01:08:14.072 --> 01:08:15.114
We linked earlier.

1601
01:08:15.115 --> 01:08:17.325
I saw everything.

1602
01:08:17.325 --> 01:08:19.452
About Jean, about you.

1603
01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:21.538
- Just shut up.

1604
01:08:21.538 --> 01:08:23.665
I'm not going to listen to this from you.

1605
01:08:23.665 --> 01:08:26.000
- Kalina is talking about suicide.

1606
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.669
- Whatever I have to do to save my kids.

1607
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:28.795
- (sighs) It doesn't add up.

1608
01:08:28.795 --> 01:08:31.380
It doesn't make any sense.

1609
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:32.757
There's got to be a better way.

1610
01:08:32.758 --> 01:08:33.592
- Doesn't add up?

1611
01:08:33.592 --> 01:08:35.552
What doesn't add up here, Dennis?

1612
01:08:35.552 --> 01:08:37.929
How much of this equation
makes any sense at all?

1613
01:08:37.929 --> 01:08:39.680
(quietly) Goddamn it.

1614
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:40.556
Goddamn it.

1615
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.894
All I can think about are my kids.

1616
01:08:46.146 --> 01:08:49.023
I don't even know if they're alive.

1617
01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:53.945
- Then let's go out there and find out.

1618
01:08:53.945 --> 01:08:55.780
One last time, while there's still time.

1619
01:08:55.781 --> 01:08:56.656
You and me.

1620
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:00.201
(tense music)

1621
01:09:08.084 --> 01:09:11.462
- Kalina, no matter what I decide to do

1622
01:09:11.463 --> 01:09:13.548
or what happens to any of us,

1623
01:09:13.548 --> 01:09:16.801
are you sure you can stop that machine?

1624
01:09:16.802 --> 01:09:17.886
- I've got enough explosives

1625
01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:20.847
to blow us back to the 15th Century.

1626
01:09:22.682 --> 01:09:23.474
- Okay.

1627
01:09:25.936 --> 01:09:27.479
How many flares you have left?

1628
01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:28.354
- One. Why?

1629
01:09:29.272 --> 01:09:30.606
- We're going out again.

1630
01:09:30.607 --> 01:09:32.025
- Oh, no fucking way, Arthur!

1631
01:09:32.025 --> 01:09:34.610
You're gonna get yourself killed!

1632
01:09:34.611 --> 01:09:36.029
- Not if we take that.

1633
01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:38.281
(dramatic music)

1634
01:09:38.281 --> 01:09:39.198
- We've got about 10 minutes

1635
01:09:39.199 --> 01:09:42.452
until the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.

1636
01:09:44.955 --> 01:09:45.997
- Go, go, go.

1637
01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:49.751
- [Kalina] We'll go downstairs

1638
01:09:49.751 --> 01:09:51.461
to try and buy you some more time.

1639
01:09:51.461 --> 01:09:54.422
- After you, Captain America.

1640
01:09:54.422 --> 01:09:56.882
(tense music)

1641
01:09:57.926 --> 01:10:00.720
(flare crackling)

1642
01:10:01.638 --> 01:10:04.265
(Kalina grunts)

1643
01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:08.936
- [Maggie] Damn, I just
got my nails done. (grunts)

1644
01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:11.356
- Here, put these on.

1645
01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:12.440
Come on, let's go!

1646
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.691
Come on!

1647
01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:16.152
(eerie music)

1648
01:10:47.684 --> 01:10:49.560
- There's no place like home.

1649
01:10:49.561 --> 01:10:51.396
There's no place like home.

1650
01:10:51.396 --> 01:10:52.897
There's no place like home.

1651
01:10:52.898 --> 01:10:55.358
There's no place like home.

1652
01:10:55.358 --> 01:10:56.734
- Knock it off, Dennis.

1653
01:10:56.735 --> 01:10:58.778
Just keep your eyes open.

1654
01:11:00.405 --> 01:11:03.157
- I sure as hell hope
I don't bleed to death.

1655
01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:05.034
'Cause that would suck.

1656
01:11:07.495 --> 01:11:08.287
Rotate.

1657
01:11:09.205 --> 01:11:11.665
(tense music)

1658
01:11:15.128 --> 01:11:18.089
(flare crackling)

1659
01:11:18.089 --> 01:11:20.674
- (gasps) Is that half the lawyer?

1660
01:11:20.675 --> 01:11:21.967
- Here, take this.

1661
01:11:21.968 --> 01:11:22.802
Move it!

1662
01:11:22.802 --> 01:11:23.636
- [Maggie] Oh, my God.

1663
01:11:23.637 --> 01:11:24.471
- [Kalina] Come on!

1664
01:11:24.471 --> 01:11:25.305
- [Maggie] He's definitely looked better.

1665
01:11:25.305 --> 01:11:27.765
(tense music)

1666
01:11:33.855 --> 01:11:36.524
(ghost growling)

1667
01:11:38.777 --> 01:11:41.821
(mechanism whirring)

1668
01:11:45.825 --> 01:11:49.036
(Kalina gasps)

1669
01:11:49.037 --> 01:11:52.081
(mechanism whirring)

1670
01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:58.671
- Oh, my God.

1671
01:11:58.672 --> 01:11:59.464
Shit.

1672
01:12:01.883 --> 01:12:03.676
Girl, hurry up!

1673
01:12:03.677 --> 01:12:06.137
(eerie music)

1674
01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:16.064
(lever clanks)

1675
01:12:16.064 --> 01:12:19.067
(mechanism whirring)

1676
01:12:20.318 --> 01:12:22.778
(tense music)

1677
01:12:26.658 --> 01:12:28.326
(bat slamming glass)

1678
01:12:28.326 --> 01:12:31.203
(Dennis exclaims)

1679
01:12:31.204 --> 01:12:32.246
- Ram him!

1680
01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:35.208
- He's swinging for the fences!

1681
01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:38.002
(suspenseful music)

1682
01:12:38.003 --> 01:12:39.462
(Maggie screams)

1683
01:12:39.462 --> 01:12:42.423
(suspenseful music)

1684
01:12:44.175 --> 01:12:45.259
- Kalina, get over here!

1685
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.094
This flare shit ain't working!

1686
01:12:46.094 --> 01:12:46.886
Hurry up!

1687
01:12:47.887 --> 01:12:51.515
(suspenseful music)

1688
01:12:51.516 --> 01:12:54.310
(Arthur shouting)

1689
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:59.482
(suspenseful music)

1690
01:12:59.482 --> 01:13:00.649
(Kalina grunting)

1691
01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:03.194
(Maggie thuds)

1692
01:13:04.988 --> 01:13:07.448
(tense music)

1693
01:13:15.415 --> 01:13:18.251
(Cyrus laughs)

1694
01:13:18.251 --> 01:13:19.877
(dramatic music)

1695
01:13:19.878 --> 01:13:20.670
- Oh!

1696
01:13:22.088 --> 01:13:24.090
- Where is it?

1697
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:24.924
Where is it?

1698
01:13:24.924 --> 01:13:25.883
Where is it?

1699
01:13:26.926 --> 01:13:28.552
Kalina?

1700
01:13:28.553 --> 01:13:29.387
- Why?

1701
01:13:29.387 --> 01:13:30.221
Why are you so mad at me?

1702
01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:32.139
I did everything you asked me to do.

1703
01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:32.974
- Kalina.

1704
01:13:32.974 --> 01:13:34.141
- I killed Damon, I stole his spells.

1705
01:13:34.142 --> 01:13:34.976
- Kalina.

1706
01:13:34.976 --> 01:13:36.143
- I even made sure your pathetic nephew

1707
01:13:36.144 --> 01:13:37.728
didn't get himself killed.

1708
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:38.521
- Kalina!

1709
01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:43.109
Where are the spells?

1710
01:13:43.109 --> 01:13:45.569
(tense music)

1711
01:13:48.073 --> 01:13:50.700
- You're not mad at me, are you?

1712
01:13:52.285 --> 01:13:53.577
- Of course not.

1713
01:13:54.829 --> 01:13:55.913
- What is it?

1714
01:13:55.914 --> 01:13:56.748
- Oh shit.

1715
01:13:56.748 --> 01:13:57.540
- Dennis?

1716
01:13:59.793 --> 01:14:02.504
(ghost growling)

1717
01:14:04.714 --> 01:14:06.006
- There's only room for
one of us back there.

1718
01:14:06.007 --> 01:14:06.841
- Hey!

1719
01:14:06.841 --> 01:14:08.425
What the hell are you doing?

1720
01:14:08.426 --> 01:14:09.260
- Don't worry about it, Arthur.

1721
01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.469
I've been looking for
a reason to like myself

1722
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:11.804
for a long time.

1723
01:14:11.805 --> 01:14:13.389
- Don't, Dennis, don't do this!

1724
01:14:13.389 --> 01:14:14.431
- Hey, bro!

1725
01:14:14.432 --> 01:14:16.434
You ain't nothing but a bitch!

1726
01:14:16.434 --> 01:14:18.769
(Dennis screams)

1727
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:20.938
- [Arthur] Dennis, no!

1728
01:14:20.939 --> 01:14:21.814
Oh, no, no!

1729
01:14:24.317 --> 01:14:25.609
(ghost growling)

1730
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:29.113
(mechanism clanks)

1731
01:14:29.114 --> 01:14:32.075
(door banging open)

1732
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:37.538
(Dennis shouting)

1733
01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:38.581
No!

1734
01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:39.790
No!

1735
01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:40.833
- Oh, my God!

1736
01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:43.419
(Dennis screaming)

1737
01:14:43.419 --> 01:14:44.211
- No!

1738
01:14:45.463 --> 01:14:46.338
Dennis!

1739
01:14:46.339 --> 01:14:49.050
(ghost growling)

1740
01:14:51.803 --> 01:14:54.514
(dramatic music)

1741
01:14:57.433 --> 01:15:00.144
(ghost growling)

1742
01:15:00.145 --> 01:15:02.772
(Dennis grunts)

1743
01:15:05.692 --> 01:15:06.484
- Dennis!

1744
01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:08.361
- Ah!

1745
01:15:09.946 --> 01:15:12.365
(scary music)

1746
01:15:12.365 --> 01:15:13.741
- No!

1747
01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:15.325
No!

1748
01:15:15.326 --> 01:15:17.745
(scary music)

1749
01:15:19.914 --> 01:15:22.708
(bones crunching)

1750
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.211
Ah!

1751
01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:27.755
(Dennis thuds)

1752
01:15:29.048 --> 01:15:31.759
(ghost laughing)

1753
01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:34.554
- So what are we gonna do now?

1754
01:15:34.554 --> 01:15:36.264
Your nephew believes
that sacrificing himself

1755
01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:37.723
will save his kids.

1756
01:15:37.724 --> 01:15:39.100
But he won't do it unless he's convinced

1757
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.601
his kids are in jeopardy.

1758
01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:42.645
- [Cyrus] Well, put them in jeopardy.

1759
01:15:42.645 --> 01:15:43.437
- What?

1760
01:15:44.814 --> 01:15:45.648
- Why not?

1761
01:15:45.648 --> 01:15:47.066
- But they're kids.

1762
01:15:47.066 --> 01:15:49.610
- Greatness requires sacrifice.

1763
01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:53.239
Now, I have a job to do.

1764
01:15:54.157 --> 01:15:55.449
And so have you.

1765
01:15:57.994 --> 01:15:59.537
Do it.

1766
01:15:59.537 --> 01:16:00.788
Do it!

1767
01:16:00.788 --> 01:16:03.457
- (quietly) Yes.

1768
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:08.712
- And now to finish this.

1769
01:16:09.923 --> 01:16:13.343
(recorded voice chanting)

1770
01:16:22.435 --> 01:16:23.811
(ghosts growling)

1771
01:16:23.811 --> 01:16:27.272
(recorded voice chanting)

1772
01:16:47.085 --> 01:16:49.712
(Arthur crying)

1773
01:16:55.802 --> 01:16:58.513
(dramatic music)

1774
01:17:05.144 --> 01:17:06.687
- Oh, my God, Jean.

1775
01:17:09.357 --> 01:17:10.983
I loved you so much.

1776
01:17:13.653 --> 01:17:14.528
I miss you.

1777
01:17:17.323 --> 01:17:18.115
Miss you.

1778
01:17:19.993 --> 01:17:22.620
I'm nothing without you.

1779
01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.081
(recorded voice chanting)

1780
01:17:29.168 --> 01:17:29.960
Jean.

1781
01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:32.796
No.

1782
01:17:32.797 --> 01:17:33.589
No, don't.

1783
01:17:34.507 --> 01:17:35.299
Don't go.

1784
01:17:36.426 --> 01:17:39.595
(Crying) Don't go.

1785
01:17:39.595 --> 01:17:42.264
(dramatic music)

1786
01:17:50.648 --> 01:17:52.024
- Fetch the book.

1787
01:17:53.318 --> 01:17:56.029
(dramatic music)

1788
01:17:59.991 --> 01:18:02.743
(lever clanks)

1789
01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.078
- Cyrus!

1790
01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:05.120
Cyrus!

1791
01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:06.038
What are you doing?

1792
01:18:06.039 --> 01:18:08.624
- You just can't teach some people.

1793
01:18:08.624 --> 01:18:12.127
I thought I told you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

1794
01:18:12.128 --> 01:18:15.464
(Kalina screaming)

1795
01:18:15.465 --> 01:18:19.093
(mechanism whirring)

1796
01:18:19.093 --> 01:18:21.804
(suspenseful music)

1797
01:18:21.804 --> 01:18:22.638
- [Bobby] Kathy!

1798
01:18:22.638 --> 01:18:23.472
- Bobby, don't look!

1799
01:18:23.473 --> 01:18:25.349
- I don't want to look!

1800
01:18:27.226 --> 01:18:28.644
(mechanism clanging)

1801
01:18:28.644 --> 01:18:30.103
Kathy, I'm scared!

1802
01:18:31.022 --> 01:18:33.274
(Arthur grunts)

1803
01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:34.441
- Hey!

1804
01:18:34.442 --> 01:18:35.901
Kathy!

1805
01:18:35.902 --> 01:18:36.944
Kathy!

1806
01:18:36.944 --> 01:18:37.861
Bobby!

1807
01:18:37.862 --> 01:18:38.696
Hey!

1808
01:18:38.696 --> 01:18:39.822
Kathy!

1809
01:18:39.822 --> 01:18:40.656
Kathy!

1810
01:18:40.656 --> 01:18:41.657
- Daddy!
- Dad!

1811
01:18:41.657 --> 01:18:42.449
- Bobby!

1812
01:18:44.035 --> 01:18:45.286
- [Bobby] Dad, help!

1813
01:18:45.286 --> 01:18:48.080
(mechanism clanging)

1814
01:18:48.081 --> 01:18:51.084
(dramatic music)

1815
01:18:51.084 --> 01:18:51.959
- Oh, boy.

1816
01:18:51.959 --> 01:18:55.420
(recorded voice chanting)

1817
01:18:57.882 --> 01:18:59.508
- Make it stop, Dad!

1818
01:18:59.509 --> 01:19:01.010
Make it stop!

1819
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:04.471
(recorded voice chanting)

1820
01:19:08.267 --> 01:19:10.686
(tense music)

1821
01:19:17.777 --> 01:19:19.653
- [Kalina] This house is not a house.

1822
01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:20.863
It is a machine

1823
01:19:22.115 --> 01:19:23.866
(thunder crashing)

1824
01:19:23.866 --> 01:19:25.576
designed by the devil

1825
01:19:27.036 --> 01:19:29.371
and powered by the dead.

1826
01:19:29.372 --> 01:19:32.541
(recorded voice chanting)

1827
01:19:32.542 --> 01:19:33.543
According to Basileus,

1828
01:19:33.543 --> 01:19:37.463
there should be 12 earthbound
spirits trapped inside.

1829
01:19:37.463 --> 01:19:39.381
(recorded voice chanting)

1830
01:19:39.382 --> 01:19:41.801
They represent the Black Zodiac.

1831
01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:43.928
(recorded voice chanting)

1832
01:19:43.928 --> 01:19:48.428

And The Juggernaut.

1848
01:20:09.537 --> 01:20:10.329

1849
01:20:12.415 --> 01:20:14.875
(eerie music)

1850
01:20:18.045 --> 01:20:20.505
- You're the thirteenth ghost.

1851
01:20:24.552 --> 01:20:26.679
- If I'm the thirteenth...

1852
01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:30.641
(dramatic music)

1853
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:35.771

(recorded voice chanting)

1856

(thrilling music)

1858

(thrilling music)

1860

1861
01:20:56.667 --> 01:20:58.377
You are nothing, Arthur!

1862
01:20:58.377 --> 01:20:59.503
Do you hear? Nothing!

1863
01:20:59.504 --> 01:21:01.088
You loser!

1864
01:21:01.088 --> 01:21:03.840
I've dedicated my entire life to this.

1865
01:21:03.841 --> 01:21:06.426
Every waking moment for years.

1866
01:21:06.427 --> 01:21:08.595
Have you ever shown
that kind of dedication?

1867
01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:09.471
Have you?

1868
01:21:09.472 --> 01:21:11.056
Have you?

1869
01:21:11.057 --> 01:21:14.560
The world has no time for
little people like you.

1870
01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.729
It needs people who are
willing to do anything!

1871
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:18.772
(Arthur groans)

1872
01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:20.649
Anything for greatness.

1873
01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:29.200
You don't have a choice this time, Arthur.

1874
01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.160
You will make that leap.

1875
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.997
The machine requires a ghost to be created

1876
01:21:35.998 --> 01:21:36.915
out of an act of pure love.

1877
01:21:36.916 --> 01:21:38.667
(Kathy and Bobby laughing)

1878
01:21:38.668 --> 01:21:40.544
That's why I chose you, nephew.

1879
01:21:40.545 --> 01:21:42.255
You and your pathetic family.

1880
01:21:42.255 --> 01:21:43.798
- Make it stop, Dad!

1881
01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:48.298
- Congratulations, you get to
become the thirteenth ghost.

1882
01:21:48.469 --> 01:21:49.428
Now, get on your feet.

(mechanism clanging)

1892
01:22:27.174 --> 01:22:27.966

(mechanism clanging)

1898
01:23:02.168 --> 01:23:05.754
- Trust me, Arthur, it's not over yet.

1899
01:23:05.755 --> 01:23:07.381
You can finish this.

1900
01:23:09.634 --> 01:23:12.887
You still have the power in you.

1901
01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:15.014
It's just a matter of how you use it.

1902
01:23:15.014 --> 01:23:18.142
You go to your kids, they need you.

1903
01:23:18.142 --> 01:23:20.853
(dramatic music)

1904
01:23:26.233 --> 01:23:27.400
- [Bobby] Help, Dad!

1905
01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:28.193
Help!

1906
01:23:29.403 --> 01:23:30.612
- [Kathy] Daddy, don't!

1907
01:23:30.613 --> 01:23:32.031
Don't do it!

1908
01:23:32.031 --> 01:23:34.700
(dramatic music)

1909
01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:35.826

1911
01:23:41.207 --> 01:23:44.251
(mechanism blasting)

1912
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.172

1913
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:51.758
(Kathy and Bobby screaming)

1914
01:23:51.759 --> 01:23:54.803
(windows shattering)

1915
01:23:58.641 --> 01:23:59.475

You okay?

1927
01:25:04.957 --> 01:25:07.417

1928
01:25:08.544 --> 01:25:10.170
- I didn't.

1929
01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:13.674
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.

1930
01:25:13.674 --> 01:25:16.134
I love you both so much.

1931
01:25:16.135 --> 01:25:18.679
(gentle music)

1932
01:25:28.314 --> 01:25:29.106

1934
01:25:32.985 --> 01:25:35.612
