1
00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:52.261
We've only got a
few minutes, guys, let's go.

2
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:28.797
Ah!

3
00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:34.969
Is it bad tonight?

4
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.346
Oh, bad?

5
00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:39.224
That's one way to describe it.

6
00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:43.102
Uh, insane seems a
little more appropriate.

7
00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.022
It feels like he's
breathing down my neck, man.

8
00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:47.899
It is my professional opinion

9
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.526
we should get the hell out of here.

10
00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:51.027
Now.

11
00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:51.820
Noted.

12
00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:57.534
Clean this place up and
then locate our guests.

13
00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.038
Oh!

14
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.332
Ah!

15
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.876
I just need to take the edge off.

16
00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:08.628
You know the routine.

17
00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.130
I need you clearheaded.

18
00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:12.674
First things first.

19
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.596
Now, where is he?

20
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.684
Uh...

21
00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:24.937
Show me where he's hiding.

22
00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:40.201
You son of a bitch!

23
00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:41.995
You said he only killed 9 people.

24
00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:43.788
There's 40 victims here!

25
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.456
9 when he was alive.

26
00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:46.875
He's added a few since then.

27
00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.836
Now where is he, Dennis?

28
00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:01.097
All teams go to Alpha.

29
00:04:01.098 --> 00:04:02.682
Bring in the cube!

30
00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.270
So how'd this guy get
this name, "The Breaker?"

31
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.772
What is he, a truck driver?

32
00:04:09.773 --> 00:04:11.107
Simple folklore.

33
00:04:11.108 --> 00:04:14.736
The local color exorcizing its demons.

34
00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:16.195
Or maybe it's because he broke his victims

35
00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:17.071
into as many pieces as possible.

36
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.536
I hate being rushed.

37
00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.246
This one isn't like the others.

38
00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:26.539
Then I'll give you a bonus.

39
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.333
You don't have that kind of money.

40
00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.918
After tonight you'll be surprised.

41
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.087
Now, get to work.

42
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.761
Careful, Dennis!

43
00:04:40.971 --> 00:04:42.764
Don't... get too curious.

44
00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:46.559
No!

45
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.769
Son of a bitch!

46
00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.898
How can you possibly justify
what you're doing, Cyrus?

47
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.483
It's out and out slavery!

48
00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:55.610
I'll give you this,
Damon, you are persistent.

49
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:57.070
And what about you, Kalina?

50
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:01.240
Still carrying around those
ridiculous quicksilver flares?

51
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:03.326
You still have that quaint magical book?

52
00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:05.411
These aren't animals you're capturing!

53
00:05:05.412 --> 00:05:07.121
They're human beings!

54
00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:08.790
They are dead human beings.

55
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.333
Maybe you should join Greenpeace.

56
00:05:10.334 --> 00:05:12.669
Throw blood on old women's furs.

57
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.007
Who are you to play God?

58
00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:19.842
Playing is for children.

59
00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:21.886
You'll never pull it off.

60
00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:24.263
Not without the right spells.

61
00:05:24.264 --> 00:05:26.099
That, and the thirteenth ghost.

62
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.392
The thirteenth ghost?

63
00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.394
Get them out of my sight!

64
00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:30.395
We've wasted too much time already.

65
00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:31.230
All right, let's go!

66
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:32.397
Move!

67
00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.273
Why'd he say thirteenth?

68
00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:36.901
Move the cube into position.

69
00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:39.070
What's he talking about, 13 ghosts?

70
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.072
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!

71
00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:43.032
The Breaker is 12!

72
00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:44.993
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus!

73
00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.121
Yes, 12 and then one more.

74
00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:49.414
I thought you were psychic!

75
00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.416
That's not how it works and you know it!

76
00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:54.210
There's no time to argue.

77
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:55.920
Release the bait!

78
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:56.796
What bait?

79
00:05:56.797 --> 00:05:59.508
We never needed bait before!

80
00:06:11.895 --> 00:06:13.396
A truck full of blood?

81
00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:15.899
You've got to be shitting me.

82
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.402
Oh, boy!

83
00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:26.076
Now.

84
00:06:27.327 --> 00:06:29.662
Power up the cube.

85
00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:38.046
Start transmitting.

86
00:07:08.535 --> 00:07:09.327
Come.

87
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:11.913
Come.

88
00:07:13.207 --> 00:07:14.791
Come!

89
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:22.340
Oh, God!

90
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.674
Help me!

91
00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.386
Help me!

92
00:07:31.475 --> 00:07:32.350
Oh, shit!

93
00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:35.353
Ah!

94
00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.146
God!

95
00:07:41.568 --> 00:07:43.152
No!

96
00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:27.947
No!

97
00:08:36.623 --> 00:08:38.082
Hey, hey!

98
00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.167
Put him down!

99
00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:39.960
Hey! Hey!

100
00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:49.343
Ah!

101
00:08:53.807 --> 00:08:55.516
Hey, Cyrus.

102
00:08:55.517 --> 00:08:56.476
I hope you're happy.

103
00:08:56.477 --> 00:08:57.518
You've got your 12 now.

104
00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.311
Help me!

105
00:08:59.313 --> 00:09:00.188
He's dying!

106
00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:01.982
Hang on, Damon!

107
00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:02.816
Somebody help!

108
00:09:02.817 --> 00:09:04.650
God damn you, Cyrus!

109
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:06.694
Somebody help me, please!

110
00:09:08.322 --> 00:09:09.156
Help me!

111
00:09:09.156 --> 00:09:09.990
Do something!

112
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.782
Oh.

113
00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:14.327
Oh.

114
00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:16.496
Oh.

115
00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:20.125
Oh, Cyrus.

116
00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.419
Oh, God.

117
00:09:25.547 --> 00:09:26.839
Oh, Cyrus, oh...

118
00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:33.680
Swing me!

119
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:34.889
Come on, Bobby.

120
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.724
Come on, Kathy!

121
00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:37.225
Faster!

122
00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:39.101
Here, let me get your arms.

123
00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:40.811
Come on, Kathy, try to drag me.

124
00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:42.230
You're the best little brother!

125
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:43.397
{\An8}Oh, I love you.

126
00:09:43.398 --> 00:09:44.357
{\An8}Come on, let's go!

127
00:09:44.358 --> 00:09:45.650
{\An8}Come on.

128
00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:46.485
{\An8}I'm going to get you!

129
00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:49.028
I'm going to get you!

130
00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:50.321
Let's play, come on!

131
00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:51.156
Kathy!

132
00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:52.365
Look at those two.

133
00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:53.200
She's got him on the run now,

134
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:54.283
but before you know it,

135
00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:55.493
he's going to be picking her up

136
00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:58.246
and throwing her over his shoulder.

137
00:09:58.247 --> 00:10:00.498
They're perfect.

138
00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:01.333
Watch, watch them.

139
00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.208
Watch them.

140
00:10:04.544 --> 00:10:05.419
They really love this place.

141
00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.305
I love you, you know that?

142
00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:17.181
Surprise!

143
00:10:19.977 --> 00:10:20.811
{\An8}Ah, my heart!

144
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:21.645
{\An8}My heart!

145
00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:22.479
{\An8}Happy birthday, Dad!

146
00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:23.313
{\An8}Happy birthday!

147
00:10:23.314 --> 00:10:24.855
{\An8}Happy birthday!

148
00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:26.732
Happy birthday, Arthur.

149
00:10:26.733 --> 00:10:28.359
Dad, here's my present.

150
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.944
We love you! Make a wish!

151
00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:30.779
Blow out the candles.

152
00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:34.699
What did you wish for?

153
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.534
I love you.

154
00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:37.118
Ah, I love you, too.

155
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:44.292
What's that?

156
00:10:44.293 --> 00:10:45.668
Why is the smoke alarm on?

157
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:46.586
It's the fire alarm.

158
00:10:46.587 --> 00:10:48.087
I'll get the kids, you
call the fire department.

159
00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:49.547
Dad! Help, Mom!

160
00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:50.923
Get the kids.

161
00:10:50.924 --> 00:10:51.966
Mom! Dad!

162
00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:53.217
Get the kids!

163
00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:54.052
Mom!

164
00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:54.886
Dad! Help me!

165
00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:56.555
Dad, come on!

166
00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:57.514
Where's your mom?

167
00:10:57.514 --> 00:10:58.348
Where is she?

168
00:10:58.349 --> 00:10:59.932
I don't know where Mom is!

169
00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:01.809
Bobby, come on, we have to get out!

170
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.852
Oh, my God!

171
00:11:02.853 --> 00:11:03.812
Jean!

172
00:11:03.812 --> 00:11:04.687
Jean!

173
00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:06.397
Mom's still in the house.

174
00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:07.898
{\An8}Dad, we can't leave her here!

175
00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:08.733
{\An8}Mom!

176
00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:09.568
{\An8}Jean!

177
00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:10.402
{\An8}Bobby, go outside!

178
00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:11.236
Just wait outside now!

179
00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.153
Jean!

180
00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:14.030
You can't go back in there, sir.

181
00:11:21.788 --> 00:11:23.372
I'm sorry, sir.

182
00:11:23.373 --> 00:11:25.082
She didn't make it.

183
00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:28.211
I should have gone back in.

184
00:11:32.132 --> 00:11:33.632
{\An8}We are gathered here today

185
00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:36.510
{\an8}to honor the memory and
life's work of Jean Kriticos,

186
00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:40.765
a devoted mother and loving wife

187
00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:44.101
who was too quickly taken from this life.

188
00:11:44.102 --> 00:11:48.602
Jean, you will be forever
missed, but never forgotten.

189
00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:50.358
I miss you, Mom.

190
00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:52.651
I miss you, Mom.

191
00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:56.989
God, why did
you have to leave us?

192
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.741
I can't do this without you.

193
00:11:58.742 --> 00:12:00.534
I don't want you to go.

194
00:12:00.535 --> 00:12:03.537
God, Mom, I love you so much.

195
00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:05.248
Please watch over us.

196
00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:09.002
{\An8}I'll love you always.

197
00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.305
Dad, it's...

198
00:12:22.099 --> 00:12:24.433
Um, it's almost 8:30.

199
00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:26.977
Shake a leg or you'll
miss your first class.

200
00:12:26.978 --> 00:12:29.021
Today on "Death in America,"

201
00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:32.942
cancer rates are down,
but suicide is sky-high.

202
00:12:32.943 --> 00:12:34.069
We have a special treat for you today.

203
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.239
A body was found this
morning dec-olop-olated.

204
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.448
Hey, hey, hey.

205
00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:40.408
Decapitated.

206
00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:43.661
Bobby, honey, find a healthier hobby.

207
00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:46.705
Leave me alone, you guys, I'm recording.

208
00:12:46.706 --> 00:12:48.249
'Morning, everybody.

209
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.961
Mm, something smells interesting.

210
00:12:51.878 --> 00:12:55.089
Dad they found a guy without
a head behind Dunkin' Donuts.

211
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.383
Oh, I love Dunkin' Donuts.

212
00:12:59.094 --> 00:12:59.886
Ow, shit!

213
00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:00.803
Kathy, Kathy.

214
00:13:00.804 --> 00:13:03.305
Why don't you let Maggie
make the breakfast for once?

215
00:13:03.306 --> 00:13:05.558
Honey, that's why we hired her.

216
00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:07.643
Dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?

217
00:13:07.644 --> 00:13:09.395
Well, yeah, just that one time.

218
00:13:09.396 --> 00:13:11.272
Hey, I heard that.

219
00:13:11.273 --> 00:13:12.107
Hell, I cook better than you.

220
00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:15.609
Look, we have to
try to get along here, okay?

221
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.944
Okay.

222
00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:18.112
Dad, will you tell Kathy

223
00:13:18.113 --> 00:13:21.240
that keeping a record of death is healthy?

224
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:22.075
Kathy...

225
00:13:22.076 --> 00:13:23.200
Keeping a record
of death is healthy.

226
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:24.410
Yeah, yeah.

227
00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.078
Because she's being
a real slut about it.

228
00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:27.663
Bobby!

229
00:13:27.664 --> 00:13:29.915
Don't call your sister a slut.

230
00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:31.292
Thank you, Maggie.

231
00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:33.420
I prefer the term bitch.

232
00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:36.130
See, sluts are girls with loose sex...

233
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:37.965
Hey, ho, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,

234
00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:38.800
did you do your homework?

235
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.634
Because Mr. Peterson's been...

236
00:13:39.634 --> 00:13:40.426
Ah!

237
00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:42.345
Damn it!

238
00:13:42.346 --> 00:13:43.512
Bobby that's the third time

239
00:13:43.513 --> 00:13:45.848
I've tripped on that stupid scooter!

240
00:13:45.849 --> 00:13:47.433
Sorry.

241
00:13:47.434 --> 00:13:48.893
If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem.

242
00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.562
Well, we don't have a
big place anymore, do we?

243
00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:53.022
It's the best I can do for now,

244
00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:57.193
so let's just all try and
keep our shit off the floor.

245
00:13:57.194 --> 00:13:58.028
All right?

246
00:13:58.029 --> 00:14:00.654
Now, Bobby, put away
the damn tape recorder.

247
00:14:00.655 --> 00:14:01.739
Can you do that for me?

248
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.949
And get ready for school.

249
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.661
I'm sorry, Dad.

250
00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:09.246
Ah, God!

251
00:14:09.247 --> 00:14:10.122
Must be the lawyer.

252
00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:10.957
I forgot.

253
00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.291
Lawyer? What lawyer?

254
00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:13.918
I thought our credit was all cleaned up.

255
00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:17.588
No, no, I don't think it's about that.

256
00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:20.382
Dad, they won't make
us move again, will they?

257
00:14:20.383 --> 00:14:21.425
It's gonna be all right.

258
00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:24.303
Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.

259
00:14:25.222 --> 00:14:26.139
Mr. Kriticos?

260
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.681
That's right and you're uh?

261
00:14:27.682 --> 00:14:28.724
I'm Ben Moss.

262
00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:29.559
Moss.

263
00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:30.393
How do you do?

264
00:14:30.393 --> 00:14:31.352
Please, come in.

265
00:14:31.353 --> 00:14:33.312
Is uh, now a good time, or...

266
00:14:33.313 --> 00:14:35.898
Ah, as good a time as any.

267
00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:39.360
Please, just give me one minute, will you?

268
00:14:41.988 --> 00:14:42.822
Okay.

269
00:14:42.823 --> 00:14:44.406
Sorry, I'm ready.

270
00:14:44.407 --> 00:14:48.327
Uh, I represent the estate
of your uncle, Cyrus Kriticos.

271
00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:50.704
We have an Uncle Cyrus?

272
00:14:50.705 --> 00:14:51.830
Uh, had.

273
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:54.750
I uh, only met him a
couple of times as a kid.

274
00:14:54.751 --> 00:14:56.710
He wasn't too popular.

275
00:14:56.711 --> 00:14:59.171
My dad said he squandered
the family fortune.

276
00:14:59.172 --> 00:15:00.923
We have a family fortune?

277
00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:03.425
Well, no, Cyrus squandered it.

278
00:15:03.426 --> 00:15:04.843
Hey, Bobby, isn't that great?

279
00:15:04.844 --> 00:15:06.136
You got a late uncle.

280
00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:07.388
What is he late for?

281
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:08.389
His next birthday.

282
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.558
You mean he's dead?

283
00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:12.142
Now we get his attention.

284
00:15:12.143 --> 00:15:12.977
Pipe down.

285
00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:15.062
Cyrus recorded this
message six weeks ago.

286
00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:16.022
He asked that it be played for you

287
00:15:16.023 --> 00:15:18.649
in the event of his death.

288
00:15:27.242 --> 00:15:28.034
Arthur.

289
00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:31.954
It's good to talk to you.

290
00:15:31.955 --> 00:15:33.998
Sadly, if you're watching this now,

291
00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.250
it means I am no longer among the living.

292
00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:39.295
Happily, that makes you and your family

293
00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:41.088
my sole beneficiaries.

294
00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:43.716
I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss,

295
00:15:43.717 --> 00:15:46.302
to deliver the essential elements

296
00:15:46.303 --> 00:15:48.721
in my last will and testament.

297
00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:51.015
Give it to them, Ben.

298
00:15:56.313 --> 00:15:57.813
A key?

299
00:15:57.814 --> 00:15:59.565
A key to what?

300
00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:01.275
A key to your new house.

301
00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:02.068
What?

302
00:16:03.153 --> 00:16:06.781
This house is the
fruit of my life's work.

303
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:09.075
Bathrooms.

304
00:16:09.075 --> 00:16:09.909
Bathrooms!

305
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.410
Everyone gets their own bathrooms!

306
00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:12.494
Is this for real?

307
00:16:12.495 --> 00:16:15.247
It is a one of a kind home.

308
00:16:15.248 --> 00:16:17.124
It's my home, actually.

309
00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:19.919
My home.

310
00:16:21.087 --> 00:16:22.671
I have no complaints.

311
00:16:22.672 --> 00:16:24.882
I've led an interesting life.

312
00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.468
I have seen some amazing things.

313
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.972
But the only regret I have

314
00:16:31.973 --> 00:16:35.392
is that I never got to
know my nephew, Arthur,

315
00:16:35.393 --> 00:16:38.562
nor appreciate the love
of a family like you have.

316
00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:39.397
Dad!

317
00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:43.275
This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

318
00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:45.278
Enjoy.

319
00:16:48.948 --> 00:16:50.908
Perhaps we'll meet again

320
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.452
in another life.

321
00:16:57.874 --> 00:16:58.708
Wow!

322
00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:00.042
When can we see it?

323
00:17:00.043 --> 00:17:02.002
The house is yours whenever you like.

324
00:17:02.003 --> 00:17:03.379
Actually, I'm heading up there after work.

325
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.422
If you want, you, your
wife, and kids can...

326
00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:06.257
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

327
00:17:06.257 --> 00:17:07.091
Time out.

328
00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.051
I am not the missus here.

329
00:17:08.052 --> 00:17:09.761
Uh, my wife, uh...

330
00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:13.013
My wife is...

331
00:17:13.014 --> 00:17:15.015
Our mom got burned to death in a fire.

332
00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:15.850
Bobby!

333
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:16.684
What?

334
00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:18.143
It's true.

335
00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:20.562
That's enough, Robert.

336
00:17:20.563 --> 00:17:25.063
Mr. Moss, uh, just exactly
where is this place?

337
00:17:25.193 --> 00:17:27.319
Just a couple
hours drive from here.

338
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.239
A town called Willow
Grove, just up the parkway.

339
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.491
It's in a gorgeous area,
but I have to warn you,

340
00:17:32.492 --> 00:17:34.410
your uncle liked his privacy.

341
00:17:34.411 --> 00:17:36.829
There isn't a neighbor for miles.

342
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.080
Come on, hurry up.

343
00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:39.665
S-U-F...

344
00:17:41.418 --> 00:17:42.459
Suffocate!

345
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.294
I got it!

346
00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:44.128
I win!

347
00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.379
Ah, so what, so what?

348
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.339
You think you're so slick.

349
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.633
Come on, you guys, we're almost there.

350
00:17:51.594 --> 00:17:52.970
Excited?

351
00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:53.805
Yeah.

352
00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.264
Mom would have freaked over this.

353
00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:56.140
Oh, yeah.

354
00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:01.103
Looks like things are
starting to get better.

355
00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:02.229
Right?

356
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.022

Oh, my God.

401
00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:40.452
I've never seen anything like it.

402
00:19:41.955 --> 00:19:42.747
Cool!

403
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.082
So futur-oic.

404
00:19:53.174 --> 00:19:54.008
Oh, hey!

405
00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:55.384
It's about time somebody showed up.

406
00:19:55.385 --> 00:19:56.219
Is this your place?

407
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:57.053
Mm-hmm.

408
00:19:57.053 --> 00:19:57.887
Who are you?

409
00:19:57.888 --> 00:19:59.513
I'm the power guy.

410
00:20:00.723 --> 00:20:02.391
Ah, don't touch.

411
00:20:02.392 --> 00:20:03.642
Look, you probably don't know this,

412
00:20:03.643 --> 00:20:05.143
but your house is knocking out the power

413
00:20:05.144 --> 00:20:06.770
of the whole tri-quad area.

414
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:09.147
I need to get inside
and check the breakers.

415
00:20:09.148 --> 00:20:10.148
Could you come back tomorrow?

416
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:11.900
Is that maybe a possibility?

417
00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:12.735
Oh, tomorrow?

418
00:20:12.735 --> 00:20:13.569
Yeah.

419
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.404
Let me see.

420
00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:17.573
Oh, there's about 5570 houses
right now without power.

421
00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:19.533
My bosses kind of frown on that, so...

422
00:20:19.534 --> 00:20:23.788
Right, well, that's not
really our problem, is it?

423
00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:27.708
Look, buddy, I've been doing
this job about three weeks.

424
00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:30.252
Is there any way you can
give me a break here?

425
00:20:30.253 --> 00:20:31.628
Sure.

426
00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:32.504
No problem.

427
00:20:34.424 --> 00:20:36.800
Thank you!

428
00:20:36.801 --> 00:20:38.051
Mr?

429
00:20:38.052 --> 00:20:40.345
Kriticos, Arthur Kriticos.

430
00:20:41.973 --> 00:20:43.807
It's quite a place you got.

431
00:20:43.808 --> 00:20:44.642
Yeah.

432
00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:45.476
Yeah!

433
00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:47.060
We're moving in.

434
00:20:47.061 --> 00:20:49.271
Well, one step at a time.

435
00:21:07.081 --> 00:21:07.998
That's odd.

436
00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.083
Dad, you broke it.

437
00:21:10.084 --> 00:21:12.336
Bobby, give it a rest.

438
00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:17.591
Hello.

439
00:21:18.885 --> 00:21:22.012
Wow, you can
see right through it.

440
00:21:22.013 --> 00:21:22.847
Huh.

441
00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:24.932
You guys couldn't afford any walls?

442
00:21:24.933 --> 00:21:26.642
How weird.

443
00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:30.520
Guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't
too keen on privacy.

444
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:34.316
I sure hope the
bathroom's in the basement.

445
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:45.953
Oho!

446
00:22:15.108 --> 00:22:17.693
It's like a fun house.

447
00:22:18.987 --> 00:22:20.029
It's Latin.

448
00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:33.709
Everything's so beautiful.

449
00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:37.379
Uh, family, just so we all clear,

450
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.132
Miss Maggie does not do windows, okay?

451
00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:40.925
Wow!

452
00:22:47.807 --> 00:22:51.185
What an incredible wealth of knowledge.

453
00:22:53.646 --> 00:22:55.188
A samurai sword!

454
00:22:55.189 --> 00:22:56.356
Bobby,

455
00:22:56.357 --> 00:22:57.983
in your dreams, pal.

456
00:23:01.362 --> 00:23:03.780
Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.

457
00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:06.492
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

458
00:23:15.084 --> 00:23:16.043
Oh, Cyrus.

459
00:23:17.253 --> 00:23:21.048
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?

460
00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:38.940
Goodness.

461
00:23:38.941 --> 00:23:40.734
It's like a cathedral.

462
00:23:42.111 --> 00:23:45.739
All right, first rule:
No throwing stones.

463
00:23:46.741 --> 00:23:50.035
It's marvelous, though, isn't it?

464
00:23:50.036 --> 00:23:51.746
A living work of art.

465
00:23:56.918 --> 00:23:59.044
The sooner you show me
where you hid the basement,

466
00:23:59.045 --> 00:24:02.756
the sooner I can get
my ass out of here.

467
00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:04.382
I believe it's down the hall.

468
00:24:04.383 --> 00:24:06.676
It's two doors on the right.

469
00:24:09.972 --> 00:24:11.682
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:24:16.062 --> 00:24:19.273
The construction is amazing.

471
00:24:21.442 --> 00:24:23.735
I'm getting dizzy.

472
00:24:27.073 --> 00:24:28.281
Bobby!

473
00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:29.992
Don't touch anything.

474
00:24:31.452 --> 00:24:32.244
Okay?

475
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.040
At least until we get
some property insurance.

476
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:39.501
Arthur, we've got some
papers to sign in the library.

477
00:24:39.502 --> 00:24:40.877
After that, I would love
to take you and your family

478
00:24:40.878 --> 00:24:42.379
on a tour of the house.

479
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.339
Great, great.

480
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.591
I don't want you guys
to move from this spot.

481
00:24:46.592 --> 00:24:47.759
We'll be right back.

482
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.470
Dad, you're being
paranoid and overprotective.

483
00:24:50.471 --> 00:24:53.098
Yeah, of all this stuff.

484
00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:54.724
I know you guys too well.

485
00:24:54.725 --> 00:24:56.017
Stay right here.

486
00:24:58.396 --> 00:24:59.146
I mean it.

487
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.942
Huh?

488
00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:24.087
What the...

489
00:25:42.523 --> 00:25:45.567
Where'd you hide your money, old man?

490
00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:00.416
Oh, shit!

491
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:03.877
What the hell was that?

492
00:26:06.255 --> 00:26:07.047
Oh!

493
00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:11.427
Oh, no.

494
00:26:13.387 --> 00:26:14.179
Oh, Cyrus.

495
00:26:16.265 --> 00:26:17.766
Oh!

496
00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:20.769
All right, now I know I'm dreaming.

497
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:21.562
Okay.

498
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.731
Was Cyrus a hunter?

499
00:26:24.732 --> 00:26:26.483
You could say that.

500
00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:30.984
Oh, your uncle was quite a
collector of many things, he...

501
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:34.575
Oh!

502
00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:40.622
I've marked where you're
supposed to sign, Arthur.

503
00:26:40.623 --> 00:26:41.457
Right here would be great.

504
00:26:41.458 --> 00:26:43.000
Okay, look, uh...

505
00:26:44.168 --> 00:26:46.253
I didn't want to bring this
up in front of the kids,

506
00:26:46.254 --> 00:26:47.046
But uh...

507
00:26:48.965 --> 00:26:51.842
Well, this place is beyond amazing.

508
00:26:58.266 --> 00:27:01.101
I'm just a math teacher and uh,

509
00:27:01.102 --> 00:27:03.561
the taxes alone must be...

510
00:27:03.562 --> 00:27:06.356
I have nothing set aside and uh...

511
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.070
Well, to be honest, a
fire took away everything.

512
00:27:12.071 --> 00:27:15.073
Arthur, you don't need to worry.

513
00:27:15.074 --> 00:27:18.201
Cyrus was a genius when
it came to finances.

514
00:27:18.202 --> 00:27:20.620
Basically, you and your
family don't ever have to

515
00:27:20.621 --> 00:27:22.497
worry about money again.

516
00:27:26.627 --> 00:27:27.961
You son of a bitch.

517
00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:24.351
Oho!

518
00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:26.353
Lookie here.

519
00:28:26.354 --> 00:28:27.313
Look, y'all!

520
00:28:28.272 --> 00:28:30.649
Look, look, look, look, look!

521
00:28:32.693 --> 00:28:34.027
Whoa!

522
00:28:34.028 --> 00:28:35.487
Whoa, Bobby!

523
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.032
Sign.

524
00:28:41.452 --> 00:28:42.869
Arthur?

525
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:43.662
Arthur?

526
00:28:44.663 --> 00:28:46.831
Arthur, we gotta...

527
00:28:46.832 --> 00:28:49.042
Arthur, we have to talk.

528
00:28:49.043 --> 00:28:51.044
What is the deal with the breakers?

529
00:28:51.045 --> 00:28:52.045
There's nothing wrong with the breakers.

530
00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:54.130
I'm not the power guy.

531
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:55.548
My name is Dennis Rafkin.

532
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:56.591
You're Dennis Rafkin?

533
00:28:56.592 --> 00:28:57.592
Who's Dennis Rafkin?

534
00:28:57.593 --> 00:28:59.511
My office warned me
about this guy, Arthur...

535
00:28:59.512 --> 00:29:00.346
I know that it's gonna
sound completely whacked,

536
00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:02.555
all right, but just stay with me.

537
00:29:02.556 --> 00:29:07.056
I used to hunt displaced spiritual
energies with your uncle.

538
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.354
I'm sorry?

539
00:29:08.355 --> 00:29:10.397
Uh, uh, PK agents.

540
00:29:10.398 --> 00:29:13.066
Revenants, uh, like, wraiths.

541
00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:13.901
Wraiths.

542
00:29:13.902 --> 00:29:15.151
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

543
00:29:15.152 --> 00:29:17.278
Uh.

544
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:18.488
That's okay, that's okay.

545
00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:20.573
Ghosts.

546
00:29:20.574 --> 00:29:22.826
Arthur, I used to...

547
00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:26.455
I used to hunt ghosts
with your Uncle Cyrus.

548
00:29:27.998 --> 00:29:28.873
Goats?

549
00:29:28.874 --> 00:29:29.791
Ghosts!

550
00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:30.959
Ghosts, goddamn it!

551
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.377
Listen to me!

552
00:29:32.378 --> 00:29:33.962
Race you to the end of the hall.

553
00:29:33.963 --> 00:29:37.132
Uh-uh, Bobby, I don't
think this is the place for...

554
00:29:37.133 --> 00:29:38.550
Come on, slowpoke, what you doing?

555
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:40.093
I know that ain't the best you got, man.

556
00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:41.511
My grandma scoot better than that.

557
00:29:41.512 --> 00:29:42.679
You're like a girl.

558
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.223
Ghosts as in, as in,

559
00:29:45.224 --> 00:29:47.100
as in disgruntled
spirits trapped on Earth.

560
00:29:47.101 --> 00:29:47.935
Ghosts, you know?

561
00:29:47.935 --> 00:29:48.769
Ghosts right.

562
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:49.686
As in Halloween. Boo!

563
00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:51.604
As in Demi Moore and
"Unchained Melody," right?

564
00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:52.439
Ghosts.

565
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.232
Ghosts. Right.

566
00:29:53.232 --> 00:29:54.107
Okay, I get it.

567
00:29:54.108 --> 00:29:54.942
I get it, I'm scared.

568
00:29:54.943 --> 00:29:56.276
I'm scared.

569
00:29:56.277 --> 00:29:57.111
Don't laugh at me.

570
00:29:57.111 --> 00:29:58.070
Don't laugh.

571
00:29:59.488 --> 00:30:01.322
Look, I'll explain everything
as soon as you get you

572
00:30:01.323 --> 00:30:03.450
and your children outside.

573
00:30:05.161 --> 00:30:05.995
What's taking you so long?

574
00:30:05.995 --> 00:30:06.829
Out of my way.

575
00:30:06.829 --> 00:30:07.663
I don't think
scouting is your game, boy.

576
00:30:07.664 --> 00:30:08.955
Come on, Maggie.

577
00:30:08.956 --> 00:30:09.790
I won.

578
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:10.624
Oh, you cheated!

579
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:12.709
That wasn't fair, I didn't get a start.

580
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.335
Got to be on your toes, man.

581
00:30:14.336 --> 00:30:16.296
This has to be my room!

582
00:30:16.297 --> 00:30:18.423
There are toys everywhere.

583
00:30:18.424 --> 00:30:19.757
Wonder what my room's gonna look like.

584
00:30:19.758 --> 00:30:22.260
I'm now entering
the coolest room in the house.

585
00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:30.936
I'll be in here.

586
00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:42.698
Wow.

587
00:30:43.866 --> 00:30:45.659
This place is awesome!

588
00:30:47.703 --> 00:30:51.039
Look, Cyrus has containment
cubes all over the basement

589
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.373
and I don't know why they're here,

590
00:30:52.374 --> 00:30:53.958
I don't know why he brought 'em here

591
00:30:53.959 --> 00:30:56.503
and I am not staying around to find out!

592
00:30:56.504 --> 00:30:57.587
So if I were you...

593
00:30:57.588 --> 00:30:59.422
Well, he isn't you.

594
00:30:59.423 --> 00:31:01.299
This guy has been harassing my office

595
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.926
since your uncle died, okay?

596
00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.886
I see this all the time, Arthur.

597
00:31:04.887 --> 00:31:06.471
Some rich guy passes away

598
00:31:06.472 --> 00:31:09.349
and then all the nuts come out!

599
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.267
The next thing you know he'll be claiming

600
00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:11.935
that Cyrus owed him money or...

601
00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:12.811
He did owe me money!

602
00:31:12.812 --> 00:31:15.563
He owed me a shitload of money!

603
00:31:15.564 --> 00:31:19.317
These are some funky looking specs here.

604
00:31:19.318 --> 00:31:20.318
Hmm.

605
00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:21.153
What do you think?

606
00:31:21.154 --> 00:31:22.320
I look cool or what?

607
00:31:22.321 --> 00:31:23.280
Let me see!

608
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.155
Ah! Not so fast.

609
00:31:24.156 --> 00:31:25.823
You gotta cater to my ego first.

610
00:31:25.824 --> 00:31:27.700
Maggie is the best
babysitter you've ever had.

611
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:28.660
Come on!

612
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:29.495
All right.

613
00:31:29.496 --> 00:31:32.664
I'm getting my ass out
of the big glass house!

614
00:31:32.665 --> 00:31:36.126
Grab your children, do the same!

615
00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:37.920
Are you all right?

616
00:31:49.265 --> 00:31:50.099
Jean!

617
00:31:50.099 --> 00:31:50.933
Jean!

618
00:31:50.933 --> 00:31:51.767
Jean!

619
00:31:51.767 --> 00:31:52.559
No!

620
00:31:54.228 --> 00:31:56.229
We're gonna get you some help, okay?

621
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.397
We're gonna get you some help.

622
00:31:57.398 --> 00:31:59.024
Don't touch me.

623
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.742
Oh, my God!

624
00:32:17.334 --> 00:32:18.751
Mm!

625
00:32:18.752 --> 00:32:20.378
We have struck gold.

626
00:32:21.463 --> 00:32:22.297
Easy.

627
00:32:22.298 --> 00:32:23.090
Don't.

628
00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:33.141
Okay.

629
00:32:33.142 --> 00:32:34.434
How's your head?

630
00:32:35.644 --> 00:32:36.519
Not good.

631
00:32:39.106 --> 00:32:40.857
Where's the suit?

632
00:32:52.369 --> 00:32:53.911
Power guy.

633
00:32:53.912 --> 00:32:54.704
Idiot.

634
00:32:55.914 --> 00:32:56.956
Whoa, cool!

635
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.085
Better have a pair of those in my room.

636
00:33:01.086 --> 00:33:02.921
Hey, Bobby, where you going?

637
00:33:07.134 --> 00:33:08.260
What are you staring at?

638
00:33:11.013 --> 00:33:11.888
Hey, kiddo.

639
00:33:13.724 --> 00:33:15.683
He thinks I'm gonna duck.

640
00:33:15.684 --> 00:33:16.643
Hey.

641
00:33:16.644 --> 00:33:17.519
Nice tits.

642
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:20.063
Oh, geez!

643
00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:21.397
You!

644
00:33:21.398 --> 00:33:22.815
What's the matter, honey?

645
00:33:22.816 --> 00:33:24.359
Bad representation?

646
00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:52.053
Hello!

647
00:33:52.054 --> 00:33:53.889
Not bad for an hourly wage.

648
00:34:04.817 --> 00:34:06.651
It's time to leave.

649
00:34:06.652 --> 00:34:09.821
I'll take your word for it.

650
00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:12.157
Kathy?

651
00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:20.624
Come on, this way.

652
00:34:24.336 --> 00:34:25.170
Shit!

653
00:34:25.171 --> 00:34:26.379
What the hell?

654
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.172
Kathy!

655
00:34:28.465 --> 00:34:29.257
Maggie!

656
00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.301
Bobby!

657
00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:56.075
Hey.

658
00:34:56.076 --> 00:34:57.744
I uh...

659
00:35:00.748 --> 00:35:02.875
I was just kidding before.

660
00:35:04.209 --> 00:35:06.044
Little lawyer humor.

661
00:35:41.705 --> 00:35:43.206
Kathy?

662
00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:44.082
Hey, Bobby!

663
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.042
Kathy?

664
00:35:48.504 --> 00:35:50.087
I don't believe it.

665
00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:51.297
Believe what?

666
00:35:52.466 --> 00:35:53.549
Bob...

667
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.511
I told them not to leave this spot.

668
00:35:56.512 --> 00:35:57.678
They're kids, what do you expect?

669
00:35:57.679 --> 00:35:58.513
Yeah.

670
00:35:58.514 --> 00:35:59.348
Yeah, thank you, Dr. Phil.

671
00:35:59.349 --> 00:36:01.682
You check downstairs, I'll look up.

672
00:36:01.683 --> 00:36:02.683
Bobby, come on!

673
00:36:02.684 --> 00:36:04.268
It's time to go!

674
00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:13.361
Kathy?

675
00:36:13.362 --> 00:36:14.821
Where are you guys?

676
00:36:14.822 --> 00:36:15.614
Bobby!

677
00:36:19.535 --> 00:36:21.995
Bobby.

678
00:38:31.166 --> 00:38:31.958
Kathy!

679
00:38:33.585 --> 00:38:35.211
What are you doing up here?

680
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:37.129
I told you to wait downstairs.

681
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.506
Yeah, but Dad, come on.

682
00:38:38.507 --> 00:38:40.508
- This bathroom's unbelievable!
- Yes.

683
00:38:40.509 --> 00:38:42.218
Yes, great house, beautiful bathroom.

684
00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.762
Now, where is your brother?

685
00:38:44.763 --> 00:38:46.847
He's with Maggie, I don't...

686
00:38:46.848 --> 00:38:48.849
Uh, was with Maggie.

687
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.977
We were racing and we
saw all the glass and...

688
00:38:50.978 --> 00:38:52.103
Oh, that's good.

689
00:38:52.104 --> 00:38:53.562
No, you're supposed to watch him.

690
00:38:53.563 --> 00:38:56.107
See, that's what I pay you for.

691
00:39:05.701 --> 00:39:07.661
Bobby.

692
00:39:11.164 --> 00:39:11.956
Down here.

693
00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:14.459
Maggie?

694
00:39:15.752 --> 00:39:18.004
Come on down and play.

695
00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:18.964
Is that you?

696
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.092
Maggie!

697
00:39:23.093 --> 00:39:24.635
Stop playing games.

698
00:39:24.636 --> 00:39:25.470
Bobby?

699
00:39:25.471 --> 00:39:27.847
I have something for you.

700
00:39:27.848 --> 00:39:31.058
We'll have lots of fun, Bobby.

701
00:39:31.059 --> 00:39:33.978
Don't come down, Bobby.

702
00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:35.188
Stay upstairs.

703
00:39:37.941 --> 00:39:39.317
Don't follow her.

704
00:39:41.486 --> 00:39:44.363
Down here, Bobby.

705
00:39:46.033 --> 00:39:49.910
Bobby, don't come down, Bobby.

706
00:39:49.911 --> 00:39:51.495
Bobby?

707
00:39:51.496 --> 00:39:52.955
Around the corner.

708
00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:56.459
Don't come down here!

709
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.960
That's it, Bobby.

710
00:39:57.961 --> 00:40:01.005
You guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!

711
00:40:01.006 --> 00:40:02.590
Bobby!

712
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:03.967
Bobby!

713
00:40:05.052 --> 00:40:08.179
Okay, I'll find Bobby, but
I want you both out of here.

714
00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.014
But Dad...

715
00:40:09.014 --> 00:40:09.848
No buts!

716
00:40:09.849 --> 00:40:11.390
I want you both to wait in the car

717
00:40:11.391 --> 00:40:13.142
and I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.

718
00:40:13.143 --> 00:40:14.393
Why are you freaking out?

719
00:40:14.394 --> 00:40:18.064
Kathy, just this once,
don't argue with me.

720
00:40:19.441 --> 00:40:20.608
What happened to the door?

721
00:40:20.609 --> 00:40:21.443
What's going on?

722
00:40:21.443 --> 00:40:22.277
I thought there was a door here.

723
00:40:22.278 --> 00:40:23.861
Son of a bitch!

724
00:40:23.862 --> 00:40:25.654
I cannot believe this!

725
00:40:25.655 --> 00:40:27.031
I'm going to have to break it down.

726
00:40:27.032 --> 00:40:28.992
All right, back away!

727
00:40:33.622 --> 00:40:34.414
Ah!

728
00:40:35.457 --> 00:40:37.500
That's quite dramatic,

729
00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:40.544
but you're wasting your
time, it's all sealed up.

730
00:40:40.545 --> 00:40:41.670
Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?

731
00:40:41.671 --> 00:40:43.214
Don't go there.

732
00:40:43.215 --> 00:40:45.257
What do you mean, it's all sealed up?

733
00:40:45.258 --> 00:40:48.135
What part of that code are
you having trouble cracking?

734
00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:50.513
The entire house is sealed up.

735
00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.139
Well, there must be another way out.

736
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.974
I've looked.

737
00:40:52.975 --> 00:40:55.476
Well, we're gonna look again,
right after we find my son.

738
00:40:55.477 --> 00:40:56.311
Now, get up.

739
00:40:56.312 --> 00:40:57.436
That's all right, I'll wait right here.

740
00:40:57.437 --> 00:40:58.229
Listen,

741
00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:01.482
I don't know what the
hell is going on here.

742
00:41:01.483 --> 00:41:04.652
I really don't know who the hell you are.

743
00:41:04.653 --> 00:41:06.278
And my son is missing.

744
00:41:06.279 --> 00:41:08.322
So until those questions are answered,

745
00:41:08.323 --> 00:41:10.574
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

746
00:41:10.575 --> 00:41:11.534
Now, get up!

747
00:41:13.078 --> 00:41:14.495
All right.

748
00:41:14.496 --> 00:41:15.288
Breathe.

749
00:41:20.127 --> 00:41:21.336
Did the lawyer split?

750
00:41:29.803 --> 00:41:32.012
Bobby.

751
00:41:32.013 --> 00:41:32.805
Bobby.

752
00:41:41.356 --> 00:41:42.148
Bobby.

753
00:41:52.033 --> 00:41:52.825
Bobby.

754
00:42:36.077 --> 00:42:38.454
Come on, guys, stop hiding!

755
00:42:46.296 --> 00:42:47.130
Bobby!

756
00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.255
Come on out now, pal!

757
00:42:48.256 --> 00:42:49.506
Robert, stop screwing around!

758
00:42:49.507 --> 00:42:52.343
Hey, glass family Robinson,
you're wasting your breath.

759
00:42:52.344 --> 00:42:53.802
This is Ectobar glass.

760
00:42:53.803 --> 00:42:54.637
He's not gonna hear you.

761
00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:57.431
See, this is shatterproof and soundproof.

762
00:42:57.432 --> 00:42:58.724
So what are these?

763
00:42:58.725 --> 00:43:01.143
That's a little harder to explain.

764
00:43:01.144 --> 00:43:02.895
Uh, they're containment spells.

765
00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:04.772
See, ghosts can't cross those.

766
00:43:04.773 --> 00:43:06.315
Ghosts?

767
00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:07.442
Yes, ghosts.

768
00:43:08.777 --> 00:43:11.237
See, the supernatural realm
has its own set of laws.

769
00:43:11.238 --> 00:43:13.364
For ghosts, it's spells.

770
00:43:13.365 --> 00:43:14.448
Either written or spoken,

771
00:43:14.449 --> 00:43:17.493
ghosts have to obey
whatever the spells say.

772
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:26.711
Bobby.

773
00:43:37.138 --> 00:43:39.807
The entire basement
is filled with ghosts.

774
00:43:39.808 --> 00:43:41.809
In this basement?

775
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.143
Of course, in this basement.

776
00:43:43.144 --> 00:43:43.978
What is it with you people?

777
00:43:43.979 --> 00:43:46.356
If it was next door, I
wouldn't give a shit!

778
00:43:48.233 --> 00:43:49.359
Dad!

779
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.444
I can prove it.

780
00:43:51.445 --> 00:43:52.903
Hey, I gave a pair of those to Bobby.

781
00:43:58.076 --> 00:43:59.285
Spectral viewers.

782
00:43:59.286 --> 00:44:00.744
You can see the ghosts with these.

783
00:44:00.745 --> 00:44:02.079
Bobby, come on.

784
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.914
Hey, Bobby!

785
00:44:02.914 --> 00:44:03.748
I don't see any ghosts.

786
00:44:03.749 --> 00:44:05.499
Because they're locked downstairs.

787
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.710
Dad!

788
00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:10.379
There's more of this crazy
spell shit on the floor.

789
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.297
Dad!

790
00:44:11.298 --> 00:44:12.132
Bobby!

791
00:44:12.133 --> 00:44:13.842
Let me see those.

792
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:22.141
Bobby!

793
00:44:22.142 --> 00:44:23.518
Come on out, pal!

794
00:44:24.853 --> 00:44:25.770
Oh, hidden barrier spells?

795
00:44:25.771 --> 00:44:26.854
You gotta be kidding me.

796
00:44:26.855 --> 00:44:27.689
Bobby!

797
00:44:27.689 --> 00:44:28.648
Why would he need more protection?

798
00:44:28.649 --> 00:44:30.107
All right, that's enough.

799
00:44:30.108 --> 00:44:31.817
This is not helping.

800
00:44:31.818 --> 00:44:32.901
I want you to do me a favor

801
00:44:32.902 --> 00:44:35.571
and stop with all the
haunted house nonsense, okay?

802
00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:39.074
At least until we find the kid
and figure a way out of here.

803
00:44:39.075 --> 00:44:40.868
Bobby, come on.

804
00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:42.077
I don't know where he could be.

805
00:44:42.078 --> 00:44:45.039
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

806
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.832
Wait! No!

807
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.584
What are you doing?

808
00:44:47.585 --> 00:44:48.625
What did I just say?

809
00:44:48.626 --> 00:44:51.003
Did I just say there was
a petting zoo downstairs?

810
00:44:51.004 --> 00:44:52.338
No!

811
00:44:52.339 --> 00:44:54.840
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.

812
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:56.759
Right, right, right right.

813
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:01.260
But you also said that
they're all locked up.

814
00:45:01.306 --> 00:45:02.098
Right?

815
00:45:03.224 --> 00:45:04.183
No. No way.

816
00:45:04.184 --> 00:45:05.018
Now, come here!

817
00:45:05.018 --> 00:45:05.893
Wait, wait.

818
00:45:06.853 --> 00:45:07.645
Listen.

819
00:45:09.272 --> 00:45:12.483
I'll uh, I'll make a deal with you.

820
00:45:12.484 --> 00:45:15.861
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you

821
00:45:15.862 --> 00:45:17.405
if you just help me

822
00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:20.742
find my son.

823
00:45:32.212 --> 00:45:35.672
Unbelievable.

824
00:45:35.673 --> 00:45:37.508
Get out of my way.

825
00:45:37.509 --> 00:45:38.301
Okay.

826
00:45:44.933 --> 00:45:46.893
Bobby.

827
00:45:50.063 --> 00:45:51.981
Bobby.

828
00:46:02.992 --> 00:46:05.452
Bobby.

829
00:46:05.453 --> 00:46:07.621
Get out of the basement.

830
00:46:07.622 --> 00:46:09.707
You need to go upstairs.

831
00:46:13.002 --> 00:46:15.421
You need to put on those glasses.

832
00:46:18.883 --> 00:46:20.509
Bobby.

833
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.052
That's it.

834
00:46:22.053 --> 00:46:23.387
That's a good boy.

835
00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:28.559
Bobby.

836
00:46:31.938 --> 00:46:32.730
Bobby.

837
00:46:34.149 --> 00:46:37.484
Go upstairs and find your father.

838
00:46:37.485 --> 00:46:38.569
Mom?

839
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:39.779
Go on!

840
00:46:41.197 --> 00:46:42.156
Go upstairs!

841
00:46:46.161 --> 00:46:47.287
Go find Kathy.

842
00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:49.538
Watch out.

843
00:46:52.834 --> 00:46:53.668
Watch out.

844
00:46:55.336 --> 00:46:56.170
Bobby, come on!

845
00:46:56.171 --> 00:46:57.005
Bobby!

846
00:46:57.006 --> 00:46:58.381
Bobby!

847
00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:03.010
You don't have to scream, all right?

848
00:47:03.011 --> 00:47:03.886
Just chill.

849
00:47:23.573 --> 00:47:24.948
Uh, this way.

850
00:47:24.949 --> 00:47:25.783
Hold on.

851
00:47:25.784 --> 00:47:27.576
Hold on, listen to me.

852
00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:29.745
This is gonna take forever.

853
00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:32.456
This place is just too big.

854
00:47:32.457 --> 00:47:33.999
Okay.

855
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.752
Kathy and I'll head up this way.

856
00:47:36.753 --> 00:47:37.878
You two check down there.

857
00:47:37.879 --> 00:47:39.046
No, I don't think we should split up.

858
00:47:39.047 --> 00:47:39.964
- We should stay together.
- It's okay.

859
00:47:39.964 --> 00:47:40.756
It's okay.

860
00:47:41.674 --> 00:47:43.717
Just go in a straight line, turn around.

861
00:47:43.718 --> 00:47:45.886
We'll meet back here in five.

862
00:47:45.887 --> 00:47:47.054
Five.

863
00:47:47.055 --> 00:47:47.889
Five minutes.

864
00:47:47.889 --> 00:47:48.723
Back here.

865
00:47:48.723 --> 00:47:49.557
Okay, go ahead.

866
00:47:49.557 --> 00:47:50.391
And don't touch anything!

867
00:47:50.391 --> 00:47:51.225
I don't want to go with him.

868
00:47:51.226 --> 00:47:52.101
Go ahead.

869
00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:04.363
Wait a second, let's
go back to the ghost thingy.

870
00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:05.405
There are
ghosts in the basement.

871
00:48:05.406 --> 00:48:08.575
If you don't believe me, go
ahead and look for yourself.

872
00:48:08.576 --> 00:48:10.702
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.

873
00:48:10.703 --> 00:48:11.912
What the hell?

874
00:48:11.913 --> 00:48:12.872
Give me those.

875
00:48:12.873 --> 00:48:14.164
Let me see.

876
00:48:14.165 --> 00:48:16.208
Why are these open?

877
00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:17.126
I was down here before.

878
00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.919
They weren't open.

879
00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:22.130
Oh, God!

880
00:48:22.131 --> 00:48:23.674
I hate it when they do that!

881
00:48:23.675 --> 00:48:24.758
Do what?

882
00:48:24.759 --> 00:48:26.176
They wait for you to stick your face

883
00:48:26.177 --> 00:48:28.303
right up against the glass

884
00:48:28.304 --> 00:48:29.888
and then give you a big fat boo!

885
00:48:31.516 --> 00:48:33.226
Don't do that!

886
00:48:37.564 --> 00:48:39.064
God!

887
00:48:39.065 --> 00:48:40.983
You see it?

888
00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:41.818
It's, it's...

889
00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:42.652
A ghost!

890
00:48:42.652 --> 00:48:43.486
It's a ghost!

891
00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:44.487
Just like I've been saying all night!

892
00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:45.612
Finally, a believer!

893
00:48:45.613 --> 00:48:47.614
Thank you, oh Lord Jesus.

894
00:48:47.615 --> 00:48:49.408
There are ghosts around us all the time.

895
00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:50.784
Most of them, they can't hurt us.

896
00:48:50.785 --> 00:48:52.160
Most of them don't even want to hurt us.

897
00:48:52.161 --> 00:48:55.122
A little ghost here, a little
ghost there, no one cares.

898
00:48:55.123 --> 00:48:57.916
But there are exceptions,
like this bad-ass behind me.

899
00:48:57.917 --> 00:49:00.919
The ones who die a violent
death stay in a tortured realm

900
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.130
and so violence is all they know.

901
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:04.840
What is he doing?

902
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:05.924
I don't know.

903
00:49:05.925 --> 00:49:06.759
I can't see.

904
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.761
I don't have the glasses.

905
00:49:11.222 --> 00:49:12.431
Okay, I've had it with this.

906
00:49:12.432 --> 00:49:13.640
It's time to go now.

907
00:49:13.641 --> 00:49:14.475
Now!

908
00:49:14.475 --> 00:49:15.309
- Don't touch me.
- Please!

909
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:16.144
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

910
00:49:16.144 --> 00:49:16.978
Come on.

911
00:49:16.978 --> 00:49:17.812
Let's go!

912
00:49:17.813 --> 00:49:18.813
Will you come on?

913
00:49:24.777 --> 00:49:26.653
Come on, ghost boy, move your ass!

914
00:49:26.654 --> 00:49:27.946
It's time to go!

915
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.284
Dad, slow down.

916
00:49:31.284 --> 00:49:32.118
Bobby?

917
00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:34.120
We're going to get lost.

918
00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.608
Dad.

919
00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:05.651
Listen to me.

920
00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:08.446
He's gonna be okay.

921
00:50:09.822 --> 00:50:11.532
We're gonna find him.

922
00:50:12.492 --> 00:50:14.826
So ready to leave this place.

923
00:50:14.827 --> 00:50:15.952
Oh.

924
00:50:15.953 --> 00:50:16.870
Oh, boy.

925
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:17.746
What?

926
00:50:17.747 --> 00:50:20.415
Uh, that's the symbol of The Jackal.

927
00:50:20.416 --> 00:50:21.708
What's The Jackal?

928
00:50:21.709 --> 00:50:23.710
The Jackal is the
Charlie Manson of ghosts.

929
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:26.088
And if The Jackal's out, screw the kid.

930
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:28.840
We've got to get out of this basement.

931
00:50:28.841 --> 00:50:30.801
Maybe Rafkin was right.

932
00:50:30.802 --> 00:50:31.677
I mean, maybe there really are...

933
00:50:31.678 --> 00:50:32.470
Kathy!

934
00:50:34.013 --> 00:50:36.557
Think about what you're saying.

935
00:50:37.725 --> 00:50:40.352
There's no such thing as ghosts.

936
00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:53.657
Kathy!

937
00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:55.910
Kathy!

938
00:51:10.341 --> 00:51:11.175
What is it?

939
00:51:11.175 --> 00:51:12.050
I can't see it!

940
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:13.052
Tell me where it is!

941
00:51:14.512 --> 00:51:15.346
Get off!

942
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:18.975
Hold on!

943
00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:19.892
Stay with me!

944
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.274
Get off me!

945
00:51:26.275 --> 00:51:29.277
Get off me!

946
00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:31.988
Come on, pull!

947
00:51:31.989 --> 00:51:33.071
Who the hell are you?

948
00:51:33.072 --> 00:51:36.032
Never mind, just pull, goddammit!

949
00:51:36.033 --> 00:51:37.367
Oh, shit!

950
00:51:37.368 --> 00:51:38.577
Don't, don't speak.

951
00:51:38.578 --> 00:51:40.121
- Why?
- Don't move.

952
00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:41.998
What?

953
00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:45.376
Somehow we got behind enemy lines.

954
00:51:51.215 --> 00:51:52.799
Oh my God!

955
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.592
Hurry!

956
00:51:54.927 --> 00:51:56.303
Please, hurry!

957
00:51:56.304 --> 00:51:57.680
Please, hurry!

958
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.850
Hey, little guy.

959
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:02.685
How?

960
00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:03.894
I don't think you should
be teasing the ghosts.

961
00:52:03.895 --> 00:52:04.687
Will you shut up?

962
00:52:04.687 --> 00:52:05.521
You shut up!

963
00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:08.064
You're the one who keeps pissing 'em off!

964
00:52:08.065 --> 00:52:09.107
Go.

965
00:52:09.108 --> 00:52:10.233
Go, go!

966
00:52:10.234 --> 00:52:11.068
Go!

967
00:52:15.573 --> 00:52:16.407
Maggie!

968
00:52:16.407 --> 00:52:17.241
What?

969
00:52:19.535 --> 00:52:20.744
Honey?

970
00:52:20.745 --> 00:52:22.662
I don't know, just stop it!

971
00:52:22.663 --> 00:52:23.622
Where?

972
00:52:23.623 --> 00:52:26.541
I can't see shit without
the glasses, idiot!

973
00:52:26.542 --> 00:52:28.043
Well, I can see

974
00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:31.254
and I think you should go this way!

975
00:52:31.255 --> 00:52:32.381
Go, go, go, go, go!

976
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:34.383
Shh.

977
00:52:35.843 --> 00:52:36.760
It's all right.

978
00:52:36.761 --> 00:52:38.888
It's all right now, I've got you.

979
00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:41.723
Look at me.

980
00:52:41.724 --> 00:52:43.183
Daddy.

981
00:52:43.184 --> 00:52:44.143
Okay.

982
00:52:44.143 --> 00:52:44.935
It's okay.

983
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.812
All right.

984
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.147
All right.

985
00:52:49.148 --> 00:52:49.940
All right.

986
00:52:55.822 --> 00:52:58.198
Who the hell are you

987
00:52:58.199 --> 00:53:01.159
and what the hell was that?

988
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.036
My name's Kalina Oretzia.

989
00:53:03.037 --> 00:53:04.913
I'm in the spirit reclamation business.

990
00:53:04.914 --> 00:53:05.997
What?

991
00:53:05.998 --> 00:53:07.457
I free trapped souls.

992
00:53:07.458 --> 00:53:08.292
Cyrus has been...

993
00:53:08.293 --> 00:53:11.711
Forget Cyrus and trapped
souls for a goddamn second.

994
00:53:11.712 --> 00:53:14.214
What are you doing here?

995
00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:17.176
Looks to me like I'm saving your ass.

996
00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.261
Oh, my God!

997
00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.887
It's over there!

998
00:53:20.888 --> 00:53:21.888
It's still there!

999
00:53:21.889 --> 00:53:23.849
Give him your glasses.

1000
00:53:24.809 --> 00:53:25.810
Come on!

1001
00:53:40.199 --> 00:53:41.241
Oh, my God.

1002
00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:46.037
Unbelievable.

1003
00:53:46.038 --> 00:53:48.915
Another one of Cyrus's victims.

1004
00:53:48.916 --> 00:53:52.044
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.

1005
00:53:53.212 --> 00:53:54.671
Victims?

1006
00:53:54.672 --> 00:53:57.173
Cyrus had a nasty
habit of enslaving souls.

1007
00:53:57.174 --> 00:53:58.008
That's why I'm here.

1008
00:53:58.009 --> 00:54:00.343
I intend to set them all free.

1009
00:54:00.344 --> 00:54:02.220
Listen to me.

1010
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:05.098
I need to know how you got in here.

1011
00:54:06.934 --> 00:54:09.895
I slipped through an opening
in the house when it shifted.

1012
00:54:09.896 --> 00:54:10.730
An opening where?

1013
00:54:10.731 --> 00:54:11.938
Don't get your hopes
up, it's closed now.

1014
00:54:11.939 --> 00:54:14.190
It's not gonna happen again.

1015
00:54:14.191 --> 00:54:15.901
Let me show you.

1016
00:54:15.902 --> 00:54:17.485
This is the Arcanum.

1017
00:54:17.486 --> 00:54:19.779
Many people died in the
quest for this book.

1018
00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.947
It was written in the 15th Century

1019
00:54:20.948 --> 00:54:23.158
by an astrologer named Basileus.

1020
00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:26.286
In it, he describes the
making of a certain machine,

1021
00:54:26.287 --> 00:54:28.788
one that can see into the future.

1022
00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:31.875
He wrote it while he was
under demonic possession.

1023
00:54:31.876 --> 00:54:34.127
I can't believe Cyrus built it.

1024
00:54:34.128 --> 00:54:35.629
Built what?

1025
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:37.714
What are you talking about?

1026
00:54:37.715 --> 00:54:39.466
Basileus's device.

1027
00:54:39.467 --> 00:54:42.552
We're in the middle of a
machine designed by the devil

1028
00:54:42.553 --> 00:54:44.846
and powered by the dead.

1029
00:54:44.847 --> 00:54:46.056
Listen to me.

1030
00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:50.477
I don't really give a
shit about any machine

1031
00:54:50.478 --> 00:54:53.813
or devil or Basileus or anything

1032
00:54:53.814 --> 00:54:57.651
except getting my family
the hell out of this place.

1033
00:54:57.652 --> 00:55:01.613
I came here to set the
souls in this house free.

1034
00:55:01.614 --> 00:55:04.825
You want help, you gotta help me first.

1035
00:55:06.285 --> 00:55:08.578
Kathy, can you walk?

1036
00:55:08.579 --> 00:55:09.496
Kathy!

1037
00:55:09.497 --> 00:55:10.872
Kathy?

1038
00:55:10.873 --> 00:55:12.749
Kathy! Oh, no!

1039
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.209
This can't be happening!

1040
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.251
Come on, we've got to get out of here.

1041
00:55:15.252 --> 00:55:17.087
I'm not going anywhere without my kids.

1042
00:55:17.088 --> 00:55:19.131
Try telling him that.

1043
00:55:25.846 --> 00:55:26.638
Come on.

1044
00:55:37.984 --> 00:55:38.943
This way.

1045
00:55:38.944 --> 00:55:42.404
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1046
00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:43.947
Stairs!

1047
00:55:43.948 --> 00:55:44.740
Let's go.

1048
00:55:45.616 --> 00:55:46.450
Come on!

1049
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:47.284
Go, go, go!

1050
00:55:47.285 --> 00:55:49.995
You go, go, go, go, go!

1051
00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:51.664
No, don't touch me!

1052
00:55:52.498 --> 00:55:54.082
The glasses, quick, the glasses!

1053
00:55:54.083 --> 00:55:54.917
You'll need these!

1054
00:55:54.917 --> 00:55:55.709
Catch!

1055
00:56:06.303 --> 00:56:07.512
Good job.

1056
00:56:07.513 --> 00:56:08.889
Sorry.

1057
00:56:15.896 --> 00:56:18.314
Oh, perfect, another dead end.

1058
00:56:18.315 --> 00:56:20.233
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.

1059
00:56:20.234 --> 00:56:21.234
How do we get to them?

1060
00:56:21.235 --> 00:56:22.444
Get away.

1061
00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:23.279
What?

1062
00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.113
What do we do now?

1063
00:56:24.113 --> 00:56:24.947
Get away.

1064
00:56:24.947 --> 00:56:25.781
Get away from the glass.

1065
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:26.615
Why?

1066
00:56:26.615 --> 00:56:27.449
Just do it.

1067
00:56:51.724 --> 00:56:52.725
The glasses.

1068
00:56:56.729 --> 00:56:57.521
No!

1069
00:56:58.773 --> 00:57:00.023
Duck!

1070
00:57:00.024 --> 00:57:00.858
What?

1071
00:57:00.858 --> 00:57:01.692
- Move!
- Where?

1072
00:57:01.692 --> 00:57:02.526
Go left!

1073
00:57:02.527 --> 00:57:03.818
Do something, for Christ's sake!

1074
00:57:03.819 --> 00:57:05.779
We're running out of corridors here!

1075
00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.572
Duck!

1076
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:08.365
All right, move!

1077
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.286
It's there, move!

1078
00:57:17.374 --> 00:57:18.291
Here it is, here it is.

1079
00:57:18.292 --> 00:57:19.251
We've got to get to the library.

1080
00:57:19.252 --> 00:57:21.294
It's got spell protection all around it.

1081
00:57:21.295 --> 00:57:22.129
Okay.

1082
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:24.089
Where is that from here?

1083
00:57:35.935 --> 00:57:38.228
Come on, come on.

1084
00:57:42.066 --> 00:57:45.068
Can I rely on you not to get me killed?

1085
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:47.196
I guarantee nothing.

1086
00:58:00.668 --> 00:58:01.668
See anything?

1087
00:58:01.669 --> 00:58:02.461
Shh.

1088
00:58:06.173 --> 00:58:07.007
Anything?

1089
00:58:07.008 --> 00:58:08.550
No.

1090
00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:10.051
Okay.

1091
00:58:10.052 --> 00:58:10.969
Come on.

1092
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:11.929
Okay.

1093
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:14.890
You know, I think
they're just downstairs.

1094
00:58:18.144 --> 00:58:18.936
Nothing.

1095
00:58:22.606 --> 00:58:23.815
Man, if we get out of this alive,

1096
00:58:23.816 --> 00:58:26.109
I've got to get a pay raise.

1097
00:58:27.903 --> 00:58:29.946
That's a big if.

1098
00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.284
Give me the flare.

1099
00:58:34.285 --> 00:58:35.368
Ah!

1100
00:58:35.369 --> 00:58:36.786
Oh...

1101
00:58:36.787 --> 00:58:38.663
What's wrong?

1102
00:58:38.664 --> 00:58:40.081
Come on, man, don't
start freaking out now.

1103
00:58:40.082 --> 00:58:40.916
Come on.

1104
00:58:43.127 --> 00:58:43.919
Okay.

1105
00:58:49.842 --> 00:58:50.676
What?

1106
00:58:50.677 --> 00:58:51.677
Shh.

1107
00:58:54.555 --> 00:58:55.389
Okay, what?

1108
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:57.015
Shut up.

1109
00:58:57.016 --> 00:58:58.434
Give me the book.

1110
00:59:02.062 --> 00:59:05.940
Just back up.

1111
00:59:05.941 --> 00:59:06.775
Go slow.

1112
00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:07.984
Okay, okay.

1113
00:59:07.985 --> 00:59:08.819
I'm going slow.

1114
00:59:08.819 --> 00:59:09.611
Slow.

1115
00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.072
Go! Go! Go fast!

1116
00:59:17.369 --> 00:59:18.203
What the hell?

1117
00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:19.038
Who the hell?

1118
00:59:19.039 --> 00:59:20.873
What the hell are you doing here?

1119
00:59:28.172 --> 00:59:29.047
Ah, shit!

1120
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.636
Hey, remember me?

1121
00:59:35.554 --> 00:59:36.388
- Arthur!
- Get him!

1122
00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:38.515
Get him, get him, get him!

1123
00:59:42.603 --> 00:59:43.811
Get him up!

1124
00:59:43.812 --> 00:59:45.772
Thanks for taking your time.

1125
00:59:45.773 --> 00:59:47.148
We've got to move down the hall.

1126
00:59:47.149 --> 00:59:48.149
We're gonna make a left and then a right.

1127
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.984
Where are we going?

1128
00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:50.401
Trust me, okay?

1129
00:59:50.402 --> 00:59:51.236
Oh, Arthur?

1130
00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:52.154
Trust her, just trust her.

1131
00:59:52.154 --> 00:59:52.988
All right, we're going,

1132
00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:54.155
- let's go!
- Let's go!

1133
00:59:54.156 --> 00:59:54.990
Who the hell is she?

1134
00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:57.242
I'll explain her later.

1135
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.892
Arthur, what happened to Kathy?

1136
01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:06.394
I don't know, she disappeared.

1137
01:01:06.395 --> 01:01:10.690
How do you lose an entire
family in a glass house?

1138
01:01:20.534 --> 01:01:21.326
Arthur!

1139
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:25.914
Kalina, give me the flare!

1140
01:01:32.838 --> 01:01:33.797
Arthur!

1141
01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:34.631
Get him!

1142
01:01:34.631 --> 01:01:35.465
[Go] go! Go!

1143
01:01:35.466 --> 01:01:36.425
Arthur, get up!

1144
01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:38.009
This is not the time to be a girl!

1145
01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.927
Run, run, run, run, go!

1146
01:01:39.928 --> 01:01:41.346
Stop dragging your ass!

1147
01:01:44.892 --> 01:01:46.476
Go, go, go, go!

1148
01:01:46.477 --> 01:01:48.019
Now is not the time to sit around, Arthur!

1149
01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.354
Run!

1150
01:01:49.355 --> 01:01:50.189
Get the door!

1151
01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:51.023
Go, go, go!

1152
01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.988
Arthur, are you all right?

1153
01:01:58.989 --> 01:02:01.491
God, I don't wanna be here.

1154
01:02:01.492 --> 01:02:02.742
Fucking ghosts!

1155
01:02:02.743 --> 01:02:04.786
I hate this job.

1156
01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.245
They don't seem to like you, either.

1157
01:02:06.246 --> 01:02:07.288
I wonder why.

1158
01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.377
You got something to say, say it.

1159
01:02:12.378 --> 01:02:13.795
All right, let's start with

1160
01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.880
this is all your goddamn fault!

1161
01:02:15.881 --> 01:02:16.715
If you hadn't caught them,

1162
01:02:16.716 --> 01:02:18.466
we wouldn't be running
from them now, would we?

1163
01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:20.468
It's his uncle that
built the damn house!

1164
01:02:20.469 --> 01:02:22.136
Yeah, but you helped him!

1165
01:02:22.137 --> 01:02:26.637
How could you help him without
knowing what he was doing?

1166
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:30.645
I had my reasons.

1167
01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:31.771
Money, you parasite!

1168
01:02:31.772 --> 01:02:34.357
You stole people's souls for money!

1169
01:02:34.358 --> 01:02:35.900
How depraved is that?

1170
01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:39.070
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a little bit of a freak!

1171
01:02:39.071 --> 01:02:42.365
I come within 10 feet of anything
dead, I go into seizures.

1172
01:02:42.366 --> 01:02:44.784
I touch somebody and a
whole life full of shit

1173
01:02:44.785 --> 01:02:47.662
just flashes in front of my eyes.

1174
01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.414
All right, so yeah, I'm depraved.

1175
01:02:49.415 --> 01:02:52.000
And Cyrus was my friend
and he accepted me, so...

1176
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.585
He didn't accept you.

1177
01:02:54.586 --> 01:02:56.504
You're so pathetic!

1178
01:02:56.505 --> 01:02:57.922
He used you!

1179
01:02:57.923 --> 01:02:59.841
Shut up, both of you.

1180
01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.509
Cut him some slack, would you?

1181
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.887
What difference does it make?

1182
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.849
You didn't tell him, did you?

1183
01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:08.684
Oh, God, what?

1184
01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:10.518
Tell me what? What now?

1185
01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:12.646
About the fourth ghost.

1186
01:03:14.982 --> 01:03:15.857
No, don't do this.

1187
01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:16.692
I didn't tell him.

1188
01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:17.526
Don't do this.

1189
01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.528
He has a right to know!

1190
01:03:21.989 --> 01:03:24.866
What about the fourth ghost?

1191
01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.534
St. Luke's Hospital.

1192
01:03:26.535 --> 01:03:27.744
Six months ago.

1193
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.090
You're saying my wife's spirit

1194
01:03:41.091 --> 01:03:43.134
is trapped in this house?

1195
01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:47.305
I didn't know you.

1196
01:03:48.474 --> 01:03:49.349
I didn't know her.

1197
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:52.018
I didn't know she had a husband.

1198
01:03:55.063 --> 01:03:56.189
Why?

1199
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.065
In God's name, why?

1200
01:03:58.066 --> 01:03:59.358
Tell me, why her?

1201
01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:00.401
I don't know why!

1202
01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:02.361
Cyrus handpicked them
all, including your wife.

1203
01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:03.404
When I figured out who you were,

1204
01:04:03.405 --> 01:04:04.906
God, I've been trying to help you.

1205
01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.574
You call this help?

1206
01:04:06.575 --> 01:04:07.617
She's right!

1207
01:04:07.618 --> 01:04:09.869
This is all your goddamn fault!

1208
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:11.329
Son of a bitch!

1209
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.122
Arthur.

1210
01:04:13.707 --> 01:04:15.625
You can save her

1211
01:04:15.626 --> 01:04:16.918
and your kids, too.

1212
01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.630
Just listen to me and believe me.

1213
01:04:20.714 --> 01:04:22.841
This house is not a house.

1214
01:04:24.384 --> 01:04:25.676
It is a machine.

1215
01:04:27.721 --> 01:04:30.473
It is a complete and faithful recreation

1216
01:04:30.474 --> 01:04:32.391
of Basileus's design.

1217
01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:33.684
According to this,

1218
01:04:33.685 --> 01:04:36.354
there should be 12 earthbound
spirits trapped inside.

1219
01:04:36.355 --> 01:04:37.897
See these?

1220
01:04:37.898 --> 01:04:39.815
They represent the Black Zodiac.

1221
01:04:39.816 --> 01:04:42.568
They represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

1222
01:04:42.569 --> 01:04:44.153
The Firstborn Son.

1223
01:04:44.154 --> 01:04:47.031
I want to play.

1224
01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:48.074
The Torso.

1225
01:04:51.161 --> 01:04:52.370
The Bound Woman.

1226
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:56.833
The Withered Lover.

1227
01:04:58.544 --> 01:04:59.336
Jean.

1228
01:05:06.134 --> 01:05:07.677
Bobby.

1229
01:05:07.678 --> 01:05:08.553
I love you.

1230
01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:12.015
The Torn Prince.

1231
01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:17.061
The Angry Princess.

1232
01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.065
The Pilgrimess.

1233
01:05:21.942 --> 01:05:24.027
The Great Child and The Dire Mother.

1234
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.155
The Hammer.

1235
01:05:30.534 --> 01:05:34.871
And here, the sign of
The Jackal.

1236
01:05:37.207 --> 01:05:38.541
And the Juggernaut.

1237
01:05:41.336 --> 01:05:43.796
According to Basileus, the
machine required the energy

1238
01:05:43.797 --> 01:05:46.882
of these specific spirits in
order to bring it to life.

1239
01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:50.136
Once it engages, the spirits
are released one by one.

1240
01:05:50.137 --> 01:05:52.263
The house then draws them to its center.

1241
01:05:52.264 --> 01:05:56.764
Each one adds its energy to
the machine, powering it up.

1242
01:05:57.352 --> 01:05:59.312
Powering it up for what?

1243
01:05:59.313 --> 01:06:01.314
To open the Ocularis Infernum.

1244
01:06:01.315 --> 01:06:03.232
The Ocularis? What's that?

1245
01:06:03.233 --> 01:06:04.734
It's Latin.

1246
01:06:04.735 --> 01:06:05.527
Ocularis.

1247
01:06:06.486 --> 01:06:07.778
The Eye of Hell?

1248
01:06:10.157 --> 01:06:11.157
Very good.

1249
01:06:11.158 --> 01:06:12.325
The Eye of Hell.

1250
01:06:12.326 --> 01:06:14.076
I'm stuck in here in a glass house

1251
01:06:14.077 --> 01:06:14.911
with a bunch of crazy white people.

1252
01:06:14.912 --> 01:06:16.537
Go on, go on.

1253
01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:18.831
In Hell there is an
Eye that sees everything,

1254
01:06:18.832 --> 01:06:20.791
the past and the future, Heaven and Earth,

1255
01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:22.710
the blessed and the damned.

1256
01:06:22.711 --> 01:06:24.837
If knowledge is power,

1257
01:06:24.838 --> 01:06:26.255
then the man who controls the Ocularis

1258
01:06:26.256 --> 01:06:30.092
would be the most powerful man on Earth.

1259
01:06:30.093 --> 01:06:31.302
Your uncle.

1260
01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:32.553
Great!

1261
01:06:32.554 --> 01:06:33.929
Ah.

1262
01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:37.224
So how many ghosts have been set free?

1263
01:06:39.603 --> 01:06:40.437
11.

1264
01:06:40.438 --> 01:06:41.979
And the house needs 12.

1265
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.230
No.

1266
01:06:43.231 --> 01:06:46.150
Damon said something about 13.

1267
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:48.110
That there are 13 ghosts.

1268
01:06:48.111 --> 01:06:50.863
The thirteenth ghost is a fail-safe.

1269
01:06:50.864 --> 01:06:52.198
In order to stop the process,

1270
01:06:52.199 --> 01:06:55.868
the house needs a sacrifice
of life instead of death.

1271
01:06:55.869 --> 01:06:58.079
A willing, human sacrifice.

1272
01:06:59.539 --> 01:07:01.874
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

1273
01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:05.336
The only ghost to be created
out of an act of pure love.

1274
01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:07.797
You're the thirteenth ghost.

1275
01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:11.842
The thirteenth spirit
stands before the Eye

1276
01:07:11.843 --> 01:07:13.427
at the final configuration.

1277
01:07:13.428 --> 01:07:16.722
As the Eye opens, the spirit
uses the power of life

1278
01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:19.225
to essentially short circuit the system.

1279
01:07:19.226 --> 01:07:21.977
Uses the power of life how?

1280
01:07:21.978 --> 01:07:23.813
By leaping into the Eye.

1281
01:07:23.814 --> 01:07:25.731
And Arthur's supposed to take this leap?

1282
01:07:25.732 --> 01:07:27.274
No fuckin' way, lady.

1283
01:07:27.275 --> 01:07:28.651
That's suicide, Arthur.

1284
01:07:28.652 --> 01:07:29.944
I'm not gonna let you do it.

1285
01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.237
You need to come with something else.

1286
01:07:31.238 --> 01:07:32.155
That's, mm-mm.

1287
01:07:32.155 --> 01:07:33.030
That's not working.

1288
01:07:33.031 --> 01:07:34.490
No way.

1289
01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:36.992
Love is the most
powerful energy, Arthur.

1290
01:07:36.993 --> 01:07:37.785
Meaning?

1291
01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.871
In order for you to save your children,

1292
01:07:40.872 --> 01:07:44.250
you'd have to trade your life for theirs.

1293
01:07:45.168 --> 01:07:46.210
No, no, no.

1294
01:07:47.754 --> 01:07:49.839
Let me see this.

1295
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.259
No, there's got to be a better way.

1296
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.885
I don't read Latin!

1297
01:07:54.886 --> 01:07:56.429
Well, we can try it
the old fashioned way,

1298
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:58.389
my personal favorite.

1299
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:01.016
But nobody's gonna be here
to brag about it afterwards.

1300
01:08:01.017 --> 01:08:02.435
Whatever we decide,
we've got to come up with

1301
01:08:02.436 --> 01:08:04.979
a game plan soon 'cause
time's running out.

1302
01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.939
You gonna blow the place up?

1303
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.108
The last ghost is about to be released.

1304
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:11.652
Look, I know why you feel
you have to do this, Arthur.

1305
01:08:11.653 --> 01:08:12.778
Get away from me.

1306
01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:14.071
No, psychics call it a linking.

1307
01:08:14.072 --> 01:08:15.114
We linked earlier.

1308
01:08:15.115 --> 01:08:17.324
I saw everything.

1309
01:08:17.325 --> 01:08:19.452
About Jean, about you.

1310
01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:21.537
Just shut up.

1311
01:08:21.538 --> 01:08:23.664
I'm not going to listen to this from you.

1312
01:08:23.665 --> 01:08:26.000
Kalina is talking about suicide.

1313
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.668
Whatever I have to do to save my kids.

1314
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:28.794
It doesn't add up.

1315
01:08:28.795 --> 01:08:31.380
It doesn't make any sense.

1316
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:32.757
There's got to be a better way.

1317
01:08:32.758 --> 01:08:33.592
Doesn't add up?

1318
01:08:33.593 --> 01:08:35.551
What doesn't add up here, Dennis?

1319
01:08:35.552 --> 01:08:37.928
How much of this equation
makes any sense at all?

1320
01:08:37.929 --> 01:08:39.680
Goddamn it.

1321
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:40.556
Goddamn it.

1322
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.894
All I can think about are my kids.

1323
01:08:46.146 --> 01:08:49.023
I don't even know if they're alive.

1324
01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:53.944
Then let's go out there and find out.

1325
01:08:53.945 --> 01:08:55.780
One last time, while there's still time.

1326
01:08:55.781 --> 01:08:56.656
You and me.

1327
01:09:08.084 --> 01:09:11.462
Kalina, no matter what I decide to do

1328
01:09:11.463 --> 01:09:13.547
or what happens to any of us,

1329
01:09:13.548 --> 01:09:16.801
are you sure you can stop that machine?

1330
01:09:16.802 --> 01:09:17.885
I've got enough explosives

1331
01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:20.847
to blow us back to the 15th Century.

1332
01:09:22.682 --> 01:09:23.474
Okay.

1333
01:09:25.936 --> 01:09:27.478
How many flares you have left?

1334
01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:28.354
One. Why?

1335
01:09:29.272 --> 01:09:30.606
We're going out again.

1336
01:09:30.607 --> 01:09:32.024
Oh, no fucking way, Arthur!

1337
01:09:32.025 --> 01:09:34.610
You're gonna get yourself killed!

1338
01:09:34.611 --> 01:09:36.029
Not if we take that.

1339
01:09:38.281 --> 01:09:39.198
We've got about 10 minutes

1340
01:09:39.199 --> 01:09:42.452
until the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.

1341
01:09:44.955 --> 01:09:45.997
Go, go, go.

1342
01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:49.751
We'll go downstairs

1343
01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.460
to try and buy you some more time.

1344
01:09:51.461 --> 01:09:54.422
After you, Captain America.

1345
01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:08.936
Damn, I just got my nails done.

1346
01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:11.355
Here, put these on.

1347
01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:12.439
Come on, let's go!

1348
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.691
Come on!

1349
01:10:47.684 --> 01:10:49.560
There's no place like home.

1350
01:10:49.561 --> 01:10:51.395
There's no place like home.

1351
01:10:51.396 --> 01:10:52.897
There's no place like home.

1352
01:10:52.898 --> 01:10:55.357
There's no place like home.

1353
01:10:55.358 --> 01:10:56.734
Knock it off, Dennis.

1354
01:10:56.735 --> 01:10:58.778
Just keep your eyes open.

1355
01:11:00.405 --> 01:11:03.157
I sure as hell hope
I don't bleed to death.

1356
01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:05.034
'Cause that would suck.

1357
01:11:07.495 --> 01:11:08.287
Rotate.

1358
01:11:18.089 --> 01:11:20.674
Is that half the lawyer?

1359
01:11:20.675 --> 01:11:21.967
Here, take this.

1360
01:11:21.968 --> 01:11:22.802
Move it!

1361
01:11:22.802 --> 01:11:23.636
Oh, my God.

1362
01:11:23.637 --> 01:11:24.471
Come on!

1363
01:11:24.471 --> 01:11:25.305
He's definitely looked better.

1364
01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:58.671
Oh, my God.

1365
01:11:58.672 --> 01:11:59.464
Shit.

1366
01:12:01.883 --> 01:12:03.676
Girl, hurry up!

1367
01:12:31.204 --> 01:12:32.246
Ram him!

1368
01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:35.208
He's swinging for the fences!

1369
01:12:44.175 --> 01:12:45.259
Kalina, get over here!

1370
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.094
This flare shit ain't working!

1371
01:12:46.094 --> 01:12:46.886
Hurry up!

1372
01:13:19.878 --> 01:13:20.670
Oh!

1373
01:13:22.088 --> 01:13:24.089
Where is it?

1374
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:24.924
Where is it?

1375
01:13:24.924 --> 01:13:25.883
Where is it?

1376
01:13:26.926 --> 01:13:28.552
Kalina?

1377
01:13:28.553 --> 01:13:29.387
Why?

1378
01:13:29.387 --> 01:13:30.221
Why are you so mad at me?

1379
01:13:30.222 --> 01:13:32.139
I did everything you asked me to do.

1380
01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:32.974
Kalina.

1381
01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:34.141
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.

1382
01:13:34.142 --> 01:13:34.976
Kalina.

1383
01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.143
I even made sure your pathetic nephew

1384
01:13:36.144 --> 01:13:37.728
didn't get himself killed.

1385
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:38.521
Kalina!

1386
01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:43.109
Where are the spells?

1387
01:13:48.073 --> 01:13:50.700
You're not mad at me, are you?

1388
01:13:52.285 --> 01:13:53.577
Of course not.

1389
01:13:54.829 --> 01:13:55.913
What is it?

1390
01:13:55.914 --> 01:13:56.748
Oh shit.

1391
01:13:56.748 --> 01:13:57.540
Dennis?

1392
01:14:04.714 --> 01:14:06.006
There's only room for
one of us back there.

1393
01:14:06.007 --> 01:14:06.841
Hey!

1394
01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.425
What the hell are you doing?

1395
01:14:08.426 --> 01:14:09.260
Don't worry about it, Arthur.

1396
01:14:09.261 --> 01:14:10.469
I've been looking for
a reason to like myself

1397
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:11.804
for a long time.

1398
01:14:11.805 --> 01:14:13.388
Don't, Dennis, don't do this!

1399
01:14:13.389 --> 01:14:14.431
Hey, bro!

1400
01:14:14.432 --> 01:14:16.434
You ain't nothing but a bitch!

1401
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:20.938
Dennis, no!

1402
01:14:20.939 --> 01:14:21.814
Oh, no, no!

1403
01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:38.580
No!

1404
01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:39.790
No!

1405
01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:40.833
Oh, my God!

1406
01:14:43.419 --> 01:14:44.211
No!

1407
01:14:45.463 --> 01:14:46.338
Dennis!

1408
01:15:05.692 --> 01:15:06.484
Dennis!

1409
01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:08.361
Ah!

1410
01:15:12.365 --> 01:15:13.740
No!

1411
01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:15.325
No!

1412
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.211
Ah!

1413
01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:34.553
So what are we gonna do now?

1414
01:15:34.554 --> 01:15:36.263
Your nephew believes
that sacrificing himself

1415
01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:37.723
will save his kids.

1416
01:15:37.724 --> 01:15:39.099
But he won't do it unless he's convinced

1417
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.601
his kids are in jeopardy.

1418
01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:42.644
Well, put them in jeopardy.

1419
01:15:42.645 --> 01:15:43.437
What?

1420
01:15:44.814 --> 01:15:45.648
Why not?

1421
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:47.065
But they're kids.

1422
01:15:47.066 --> 01:15:49.610
Greatness requires sacrifice.

1423
01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:53.239
Now, I have a job to do.

1424
01:15:54.157 --> 01:15:55.449
And so have you.

1425
01:15:57.994 --> 01:15:59.536
Do it.

1426
01:15:59.537 --> 01:16:00.787
Do it!

1427
01:16:00.788 --> 01:16:03.457
Yes.

1428
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:08.712
And now to finish this.

1429
01:17:05.144 --> 01:17:06.687
Oh, my God, Jean.

1430
01:17:09.357 --> 01:17:10.983
I loved you so much.

1431
01:17:13.653 --> 01:17:14.528
I miss you.

1432
01:17:17.323 --> 01:17:18.115
Miss you.

1433
01:17:19.993 --> 01:17:22.620
I'm nothing without you.

1434
01:17:29.168 --> 01:17:29.960
Jean.

1435
01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:32.796
No.

1436
01:17:32.797 --> 01:17:33.589
No, don't.

1437
01:17:34.507 --> 01:17:35.299
Don't go.

1438
01:17:36.426 --> 01:17:39.595
Don't go.

1439
01:17:50.648 --> 01:17:52.024
Fetch the book.

1440
01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.077
Cyrus!

1441
01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:05.120
Cyrus!

1442
01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:06.038
What are you doing?

1443
01:18:06.039 --> 01:18:08.623
You just can't teach some people.

1444
01:18:08.624 --> 01:18:12.127
I thought I told you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

1445
01:18:21.804 --> 01:18:22.638
Kathy!

1446
01:18:22.638 --> 01:18:23.472
Bobby, don't look!

1447
01:18:23.473 --> 01:18:25.349
I don't want to look!

1448
01:18:28.644 --> 01:18:30.103
Kathy, I'm scared!

1449
01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:34.441
Hey!

1450
01:18:34.442 --> 01:18:35.901
Kathy!

1451
01:18:35.902 --> 01:18:36.943
Kathy!

1452
01:18:36.944 --> 01:18:37.861
Bobby!

1453
01:18:37.862 --> 01:18:38.696
Hey!

1454
01:18:38.697 --> 01:18:39.821
Kathy!

1455
01:18:39.822 --> 01:18:40.656
Kathy!

1456
01:18:40.657 --> 01:18:41.657
- Daddy!
- Dad!

1457
01:18:41.657 --> 01:18:42.449
Bobby!

1458
01:18:44.035 --> 01:18:45.286
Dad, help!

1459
01:18:51.084 --> 01:18:51.959
Oh, boy.

1460
01:18:57.882 --> 01:18:59.508
Make it stop, Dad!

1461
01:18:59.509 --> 01:19:01.010
Make it stop!

1462
01:19:17.777 --> 01:19:19.653
This house is not a house.

1463
01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:20.863
It is a machine

1464
01:19:23.866 --> 01:19:25.576
designed by the devil

1465
01:19:27.036 --> 01:19:29.371
and powered by the dead.

1466
01:19:32.542 --> 01:19:33.542
According to Basileus,

1467
01:19:33.543 --> 01:19:37.463
there should be 12 earthbound
spirits trapped inside.

1468
01:19:39.382 --> 01:19:41.801
They represent the Black Zodiac.

1469
01:19:43.928 --> 01:19:48.428
The represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

1470
01:19:48.516 --> 01:19:49.933
The Firstborn Son.

1471
01:19:49.934 --> 01:19:51.143
One.

1472
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.520
The Torso.

1473
01:19:53.521 --> 01:19:54.396
Two.

1474
01:19:54.397 --> 01:19:55.480
The Bound Woman.

1475
01:19:55.481 --> 01:19:56.315
Three.

1476
01:19:56.316 --> 01:19:57.399
The Withered Lover.

1477
01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.442
Four.

1478
01:19:58.443 --> 01:20:00.360
The Torn Prince.

1479
01:20:00.361 --> 01:20:01.862
The Angry Princess.

1480
01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:02.780
The Pilgrimess.

1481
01:20:02.781 --> 01:20:05.365
The Great Child & the Dire Mother.

1482
01:20:05.366 --> 01:20:06.700
The Hammer.

1483
01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:08.201
The Jackal.

1484
01:20:08.202 --> 01:20:09.536
And The Juggernaut.

1485
01:20:09.537 --> 01:20:10.329
Twelve.

1486
01:20:18.045 --> 01:20:20.505
You're the thirteenth ghost.

1487
01:20:24.552 --> 01:20:26.679
If I'm the thirteenth...

1488
01:20:42.278 --> 01:20:43.821
You son of a bitch!

1489
01:20:48.493 --> 01:20:50.870
Release my kids, you bastard!

1490
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.667
Now hear, you!

1491
01:20:56.668 --> 01:20:58.376
You are nothing, Arthur!

1492
01:20:58.377 --> 01:20:59.503
Do you hear? Nothing!

1493
01:20:59.504 --> 01:21:01.087
You loser!

1494
01:21:01.088 --> 01:21:03.840
I've dedicated my entire life to this.

1495
01:21:03.841 --> 01:21:06.426
Every waking moment for years.

1496
01:21:06.427 --> 01:21:08.595
Have you ever shown
that kind of dedication?

1497
01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:09.471
Have you?

1498
01:21:09.472 --> 01:21:11.056
Have you?

1499
01:21:11.057 --> 01:21:14.559
The world has no time for
little people like you.

1500
01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.729
It needs people who are
willing to do anything!

1501
01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:20.649
Anything for greatness.

1502
01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:29.199
You don't have a choice this time, Arthur.

1503
01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.160
You will make that leap.

1504
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.997
The machine requires a ghost to be created

1505
01:21:35.998 --> 01:21:36.915
out of an act of pure love.

1506
01:21:38.668 --> 01:21:40.544
That's why I chose you, nephew.

1507
01:21:40.545 --> 01:21:42.254
You and your pathetic family.

1508
01:21:42.255 --> 01:21:43.797
Make it stop, Dad!

1509
01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:48.298
Congratulations, you get to
become the thirteenth ghost.

1510
01:21:48.469 --> 01:21:49.428
Now, get on your feet.

1511
01:21:54.225 --> 01:21:55.017
Come on!

1512
01:21:58.479 --> 01:21:59.396
Ah!

1513
01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:22.419
What did I do?

1514
01:22:27.174 --> 01:22:27.966
Ah!

1515
01:23:02.168 --> 01:23:05.754
Trust me, Arthur, it's not over yet.

1516
01:23:05.755 --> 01:23:07.381
You can finish this.

1517
01:23:09.634 --> 01:23:12.886
You still have the power in you.

1518
01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:15.013
It's just a matter of how you use it.

1519
01:23:15.014 --> 01:23:18.142
You go to your kids, they need you.

1520
01:23:26.233 --> 01:23:27.400
Help, Dad!

1521
01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:28.193
Help!

1522
01:23:29.403 --> 01:23:30.612
Daddy, don't!

1523
01:23:30.613 --> 01:23:32.031
Don't do it!

1524
01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:35.826
Dad!

1525
01:23:39.997 --> 01:23:41.206
Oh, fuck!

1526
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.172
Dad!

1527
01:23:58.641 --> 01:23:59.475
Okay, don't move!

1528
01:24:03.813 --> 01:24:05.105
Keep your heads down!

1529
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.401
Hold on tight!

1530
01:24:56.449 --> 01:24:57.658
Everybody okay?

1531
01:25:00.369 --> 01:25:01.161
You okay?

1532
01:25:04.957 --> 01:25:07.417
How'd you know we'd be safe?

1533
01:25:08.544 --> 01:25:10.170
I didn't.

1534
01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:13.673
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.

1535
01:25:13.674 --> 01:25:16.134
I love you both so much.

1536
01:25:28.314 --> 01:25:29.106
Mom?

1537
01:25:32.985 --> 01:25:35.612
I love you guys.

1538
01:25:40.951 --> 01:25:41.826
I love you.

1539
01:25:55.424 --> 01:25:56.758
This is it for me!

1540
01:25:56.759 --> 01:25:59.093
I'm on the first fucking
plane back to Newark.

1541
01:25:59.094 --> 01:25:59.928
Uh-uh.

1542
01:25:59.929 --> 01:26:01.471
I am sorry, family.

1543
01:26:01.472 --> 01:26:04.390
Kathy, Bobby, Uncle, ghosts!

1544
01:26:04.391 --> 01:26:07.227
