1
00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.031
What's that?

2
00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.906
It sounds like the garbagemen.

3
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.118
On Tuesday?

4
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:19.292
Maybe they changed the schedule.

5
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:23.755
Oh, shit.

6
00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:42.778
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Hey, hold it up, you guys.

7
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:53.239
I was afraid you'd miss me.

8
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.872
Don't worry. We won't.

9
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.800
Now, that is American
workmanship.

10
00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:19.706
You think the Japanese invented that?
Bullshit.

11
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:23.440
We did. Oh, for a while there we lost it,
but we got it back.

12
00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.576
- I like Cadillacs.
- You like Cadillacs?

13
00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.199
Well, come right around here 
brother and get in this Cadillac.

14
00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:30.869
You're gonna love it.
This is style and beauty.

15
00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:37.203
Comfy, right? Oh, I know what
you're gonna say. That's vinyl.

16
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.291
But take it from me, 
you don't want leather, brother.

17
00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:41.814
Leather's hot,
it's uncomfortable, it cracks.

18
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.698
Nothing but trouble.
Look at the headroom you got in here.

19
00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:46.400
A guy like you is not 
gonna have any problem.

20
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:49.462
Go ahead. Start it up. 
Listen to that.

21
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.013
That's power. 
That's performance.

22
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.560
- You know what I like best?
- What's that?

23
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.726
- The price.
- Hey! Wait a minute!

24
00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:02.558
You can't drive that car in here!

25
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.214
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

26
00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.420
Working, working.

27
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.754
Daddy. Put me down. 
Put me down.

28
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.550
- I surrender. I surrender.
- Not me.

29
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.705
I love you too.

30
00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.056
Here come the sandwiches.

31
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.728
Now, why don't they 
just call him Girl George?

32
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.772
It would cut down 
all the confusion, I think.

33
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.128
Oh, Dad, that's so old.

34
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.226
Now, when I was a boy...

35
00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:01.385
...and rock and roll
came to East Germany,

36
00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.692
the communists said
it was subversive.

37
00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.617
Maybe they were right.

38
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.994
- What's in this?
- You don't wanna know.

39
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.516
Dad, what's wrong?

40
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.904
What's that Army
helicopter doing here?

41
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.634
You said you wouldn't 
go away again.

42
00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.908
You said you were through.

43
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.334
I'm not going anywhere.

44
00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.409
Promise?

45
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.009
I promise.

46
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:48.965
Jackson. Harris. 
Secure the area.

47
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.510
John?

48
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.097
John, are you in there?

49
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:03.023
John, come on out. 
It's Kirby.

50
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.166
I know.

51
00:10:07.361 --> 00:10:09.975
Silent and smooth,
just like always.

52
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.530
- I better be. You taught me.
- I'm getting a little rusty.

53
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.583
- What's going on?
- Jenny, how are you?

54
00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.706
Hi.

55
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.589
Jenny, I need to talk
to your dad, okay?

56
00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:24.653
Yeah. Got a warrant?

57
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.255
Very funny.

58
00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:28.519
- Jenny.
- Okay.

59
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.512
John, we've got a problem.

60
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.139
Someone's killing your men.

61
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.225
You gave them new identities.

62
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.725
There must have been a leak.

63
00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:43.129
Lawson, Forrestal, Bennett...
They've all been hit.

64
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.610
Who is doing it?

65
00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:47.603
You've made enemies
all over the world, John.

66
00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.871
It could have been the Syrians,
the South Americans,

67
00:10:49.874 --> 00:10:52.343
the Russians,
or a terrorist group...

68
00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.872
They're gonna find you.

69
00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.333
We were going to make
a normal life here.

70
00:11:01.552 --> 00:11:03.271
You will. I promise.

71
00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.957
I'm going into the city to coordinate
with the Federal people.

72
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.589
We'll nail those bastards
before they get close to you.

73
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:12.432
In the meantime, Jackson and Harris
will stay here with you.

74
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.816
Are they any good?

75
00:11:14.818 --> 00:11:17.138
Real good, 
but not as good as you were.

76
00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.251
Is it bad?

77
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.333
I'm not leaving you,
if that's what you mean.

78
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.053
Then it can't be bad.

79
00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:22.079
- How bad are you hit?
- I can make it. I'll be all right.

80
00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:25.207
I've got to get my rifle
from the shed. Keep an eye out.

81
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.004
They'll be coming.

82
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.297
Remember, you're downwind.
The air current may tip them off.

83
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.418
Downwind? You think I can 
smell them coming?

84
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:35.688
I did.

85
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.775
Okay, Jenny. 
You go to your bedroom, okay?

86
00:12:39.931 --> 00:12:42.441
And stay out of sight.
I'll be right back.

87
00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.353
- Where is she?
- Mellow out, man.

88
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:35.937
We can't talk business...

89
00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:38.184
...with you waving guns
in people's faces.

90
00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.256
Your daughter's safe, Colonel.

91
00:13:42.425 --> 00:13:44.523
Whether she stays 
that way is up to you.

92
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.827
My people got 
some business with you.

93
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.537
And if you want your kid back,

94
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.127
then you gotta
cooperate, right?

95
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:53.945
Wrong.

96
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.530
He's coming at us. No brakes.

97
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.180
He's still coming,
the crazy bastard.

98
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280
He's gonna hit us.

99
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.353
Shit!

100
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.845
Don't move, motherfucker.

101
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.408
- Bennett, I thought you were...
- Dead?

102
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.316
You thought wrong.

103
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:22.435
Ever since you had me
thrown out of your unit,

104
00:16:22.653 --> 00:16:24.345
I've waited
to pay you back.

105
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.323
Do you know what today is, Matrix?

106
00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.589
Payday.

107
00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:55.181
Tranquillizers.

108
00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.770
- I wanted to use the real thing!
- Where's Jenny?

109
00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:03.315
Do you remember me, Colonel?

110
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.209
I remember you, scumbag.

111
00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:10.642
Especially the people
you've tortured and killed.

112
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.116
Colonel Matrix,

113
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:18.543
you do not understand
a country like Val Verde.

114
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:22.257
It is a country 
that needs a president...

115
00:17:22.388 --> 00:17:26.029
...who has an understanding 
of discipline.

116
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:29.717
- Why tell me?
- Because you're going to return...

117
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.148
...to Val Verde,

118
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:35.076
and you are going 
to kill the president...

119
00:17:35.101 --> 00:17:37.631
...that you helped 
to overthrow me.

120
00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.506
Why don't you have
Bennett do it?

121
00:17:39.898 --> 00:17:41.836
Sounds like something
he would get off on.

122
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:45.740
Because President Velásquez
trusts you, Colonel.

123
00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:49.160
After all, he made you
the hero of the revolution,

124
00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:53.240
while Captain Bennett left,
shall we say, under a cloud. Yes?

125
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:56.246
Yeah. 'Cause he enjoyed killing
a little too much.

126
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.703
Your training, Matrix.

127
00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:02.290
You can get close 
to President Velásquez.

128
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:03.878
You will kill him.

129
00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:07.278
You know, Colonel, 
we went to a lot of trouble to find you.

130
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.080
We had to pretend Captain
Bennett's death, so that...

131
00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:13.117
...General Kirby would become
agitated and lead us to you.

132
00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:19.854
And now that I have you,
you will do exactly as I tell you.

133
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:22.064
Fuck you.

134
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:36.244
- Daddy.
- Jenny.

135
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.789
Oh, you bastards.

136
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:48.407
Colonel Matrix, if you kill President
Velásquez, I will send her back to you.

137
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:54.218
If you try anything else,
I will mail her to you in pieces.

138
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:07.321
- Any sign of Matrix?
- No, sir. Just those bodies.

139
00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.327
You think there's more, sir?

140
00:19:09.352 --> 00:19:12.730
If he's still alive,
I'd expect a lot more.

141
00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.927
Sully will make sure you get on the plane.

142
00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.931
Henriques will stay with you,
make sure you get off.

143
00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:38.729
I don't hear from 
either one of 'em, she's dead.

144
00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.570
How much are they
paying you, Bennett?

145
00:19:41.937 --> 00:19:44.014
They offered me
a hundred grand.

146
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:45.708
You wanna know something?

147
00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:47.711
When I found out 
I'd get my hands on you,

148
00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.860
I said I'd do it for nothing.

149
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:54.111
- Hey, hold it.
- I'll be back, Bennett.

150
00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:58.997
John.

151
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.708
I'll be ready, John.

152
00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:18.082
We're running late, buddy.

153
00:20:18.107 --> 00:20:20.832
So, you and Bennett 
met in the service, eh?

154
00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:23.562
Now, me and Henriques 
was in the service too.

155
00:20:23.587 --> 00:20:25.847
There's nothing
like old war buddies.

156
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.153
Well, have a nice trip, now.

157
00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.324
Take care. Oh, here.

158
00:20:31.871 --> 00:20:34.054
Have some beers
in Val Verde, Matrix.

159
00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.403
It'll give everyone a little more 
time with your daughter.

160
00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:41.013
You're a funny guy, Sully.
I like you.

161
00:20:41.038 --> 00:20:43.520
That's why I'm going
to kill you last.

162
00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:45.669
Move.

163
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.625
<i>See you later</i>, fellas.

164
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.686
First class, 7A.

165
00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:14.453
And you, 7B, sir.

166
00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:27.954
- Any carry-on luggage?
- Just him.

167
00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:35.175
Open your mouth again
and I'll nail it shut.

168
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:39.223
- You must fasten your seat belt, sir.
- Thank you.

169
00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:41.430
Could I have a blanket
and a pillow, please?

170
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:42.638
Sure.

171
00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:53.445
- There you go.
- Thank you.

172
00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:57.699
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now preparing for departure.

173
00:21:57.782 --> 00:21:59.907
If you'll please make sure 
that all your carry-on luggage...

174
00:21:59.932 --> 00:22:02.243
...is safely stored in
the overhead compartments.

175
00:22:02.245 --> 00:22:04.224
Make sure your 
seat belts are fastened,

176
00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:05.758
and extinguish all cigarettes.

177
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.754
Once we reach 
our cruising altitude...

178
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:10.341
...we're gonna be serving
our complimentary beverages,

179
00:22:10.343 --> 00:22:12.376
and then, a little later on, 
our dinner.

180
00:22:12.378 --> 00:22:14.799
Shortly after that 
we'll be showing our feature film.

181
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:18.129
Your flight attendants 
are Susan and Lance, and I'm Vicki.

182
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:20.681
We're here to make your trip
as comfortable as possible.

183
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.236
Thank you, and have 
a safe and enjoyable flight.

184
00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:38.831
Excuse me.
How long is the flight?

185
00:22:38.856 --> 00:22:41.286
We land in Val Verde
in exactly 11 hours.

186
00:22:41.487 --> 00:22:43.236
Thank you. 
And do me a favor.

187
00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:45.854
Don't disturb my friend.
He's dead tired.

188
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.960
Upright, please. Thank you.

189
00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:57.259
Sir, during takeoff
you must remain seated.

190
00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:58.961
I'm airsick.

191
00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:56.313
Yeah, the bird has flown.
Cargo's aboard.

192
00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.811
Now go to the drop-off point.

193
00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:02.273
Yes. <i>Gracias</i>, Sully.

194
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.698
Well, we are right on schedule.

195
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:09.853
With any good fortune,

196
00:26:09.878 --> 00:26:13.446
today will be 
my last day as a civilian.

197
00:26:16.784 --> 00:26:19.247
Your father seemed
to be cooperating.

198
00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:21.668
You will be together
with him soon.

199
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:24.800
Won't that be nice?

200
00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:27.924
Not nearly as nice
as watching him kick your ass.

201
00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:32.939
Take her below.

202
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:04.211
Yeah, that Cindy.

203
00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:07.197
Well, my 7:40 flight
to Vancouver was canceled.

204
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:10.884
So, how about dinner? 
Yeah.

205
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.683
Well, I could go to bed early too.

206
00:27:22.933 --> 00:27:25.812
- Maybe we should do it another time.
- Sounds like he's mad at you.

207
00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:31.876
Okay. Well, I like you too.

208
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:34.661
All right, then.
Talk to you soon. Bye.

209
00:27:35.082 --> 00:27:37.545
Love and careers.
It's tough, ain't it?

210
00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:39.951
- Sounds like you need a date.
- Well, I don't.

211
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.752
Oh, listen, I bet girls like you 
meet a lot of nice boys at airports.

212
00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:44.922
Listen, you're really bugging me.

213
00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:39.235
Hey, slow down.

214
00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:47.751
You know, I got something
I'd really like to give you.

215
00:28:47.776 --> 00:28:48.878
I'm not interested.

216
00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:50.708
Aw, you don't know
what you're missing.

217
00:28:50.733 --> 00:28:51.903
From here 
it looks like a nightmare.

218
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.999
Would you please 
leave me alone?

219
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:55.906
You fuckin' whore.

220
00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:14.712
Don't move. I'm not going
to hurt you. Step aside.

221
00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:17.173
- You said "Don't move."
- Do it.

222
00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:19.726
Get in the car.

223
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:36.567
Do exactly what I tell you to do.

224
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.882
Listen, I've got a 7:30 advanced
karate class and I can't help you.

225
00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:41.035
You're not gonna make it.

226
00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:49.505
Follow him.

227
00:29:51.331 --> 00:29:53.135
Oh, I knew
you were gonna say that.

228
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:19.549
Don't get offended
by this question, but...

229
00:30:19.574 --> 00:30:21.678
...are you gonna kill me, 
or something?

230
00:30:21.737 --> 00:30:22.954
No.

231
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.871
I suppose you wouldn't
tell me if you were.

232
00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:27.502
- Sure I would.
- Really?

233
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.504
Trust me.

234
00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:36.050
Stay close to him.

235
00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:37.836
Faster.

236
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:43.183
- That's good.
- Would you tell me what this is all about?

237
00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:45.701
Yeah, a guy I trusted
for years wants me dead.

238
00:30:46.776 --> 00:30:48.220
That's understandable.
I've only known you...

239
00:30:48.223 --> 00:30:49.866
...for five minutes 
and I want you dead too.

240
00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.668
I'm Cindy.

241
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:06.835
Do you have a name?

242
00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:11.466
John. John Matrix.

243
00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.010
That's nice.

244
00:31:15.332 --> 00:31:19.428
- What do you do, Matrix?
- I'm a retired colonel in the army.

245
00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:24.509
Retired. Does that mean, 
like my taxes pay your pension?

246
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:27.811
- That's right.
- That figures.

247
00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:28.746
Out. Come on. Hurry up.

248
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:34.680
Listen, if you're
in such a hurry, I can...

249
00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:36.313
I'm almost through with you.

250
00:33:02.063 --> 00:33:05.363
Listen to me. My daughter
has been kidnapped.

251
00:33:05.446 --> 00:33:07.685
He's the only chance
I've got of finding her.

252
00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:10.865
If he sees me or I lose him,
they'll kill her.

253
00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:13.154
What I need you 
to do is follow him,

254
00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:15.147
tell him you're crazy 
about him.

255
00:33:15.202 --> 00:33:17.581
Try to bring him over here
and I will do the rest.

256
00:33:17.583 --> 00:33:19.834
You can go back 
to your normal life. Got it?

257
00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:22.213
- No.
- Please, help me.

258
00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.460
You're the only chance I've got.

259
00:33:24.485 --> 00:33:26.743
She has less than 10 hours left.

260
00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:29.049
Don't you understand?
They are gonna kill her.

261
00:33:29.052 --> 00:33:32.376
Okay. All right.
I'll help you.

262
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:17.890
Listen, there's this
huge guy outside...

263
00:34:17.915 --> 00:34:20.417
...in a green T-shirt, 
and he's a paranoid maniac.

264
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:22.978
And he's kidnapped me,
and I need your help.

265
00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.530
- I'll check it out.
- Thank you.

266
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:30.108
I hear you're a great man 
with transmissions.

267
00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:31.158
That's right.

268
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:54.514
Oh, yeah. These'll work just fine.

269
00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:57.749
Biggs, are you there?

270
00:34:57.774 --> 00:35:00.795
Listen, there's a guy 
over here that may be a wacko.

271
00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:02.717
I don't think 
I can handle him alone.

272
00:35:02.742 --> 00:35:05.346
I'll be right there. 
Wanna see me kick some ass?

273
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.033
- You'd better wait here, Miss.
- Thank you.

274
00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:16.664
Attention all units.
Emergency on the theatre level.

275
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.499
Suspect, 6ft 2, brown hair.

276
00:35:19.524 --> 00:35:22.872
He's one gigantic motherfucker.

277
00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:25.617
This used to be a great place
for hunting slash.

278
00:35:25.642 --> 00:35:27.407
It's got a little crowded now.

279
00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.799
I think I've found something though.

280
00:35:32.714 --> 00:35:34.224
I'll see you.

281
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.127
What are you doing here?

282
00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:04.500
I'm waiting for my...

283
00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:08.688
- Are you lookin' for me?
- You better come with us.

284
00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:17.800
What?

285
00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.224
Matrix.

286
00:36:21.143 --> 00:36:23.598
Gimme a quarter.
Gimme a quarter!

287
00:36:29.114 --> 00:36:30.212
Move it!

288
00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:46.915
Oh, shit!

289
00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:50.045
You son of a bitch!

290
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.979
- Out of my way.
- Freeze!

291
00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:16.192
Come on! Let's go get him!

292
00:37:16.484 --> 00:37:17.952
Come on.

293
00:37:21.114 --> 00:37:23.305
- Stop or I'll shoot!
- No!

294
00:37:37.297 --> 00:37:39.429
Hey, lady! Stop!

295
00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:43.658
Wait! Wait for me!
Don't you go anywhere!

296
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.915
Who in the hell are you?

297
00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:50.329
You steal my car, 
you rip the seat out, you kidnap me,

298
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:52.220
you ask me to help you
find your daughter,

299
00:38:52.226 --> 00:38:53.708
which I very kindly do,

300
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.298
and then you get me involved
in a shoot-out where people are dying,

301
00:38:56.299 --> 00:38:57.833
and there's blood 
spurting all over the place,

302
00:38:57.834 --> 00:38:59.758
and then I watch you rip
a phone booth out of the wall,

303
00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:01.868
swing from the ceiling
like Tarzan,

304
00:39:01.893 --> 00:39:03.742
and then there's a a cop 
who's gonna shoot you...

305
00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:06.818
...and I save you,
and he starts chasing me!

306
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.771
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on or what?

307
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.356
- No.
- No?

308
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:15.441
No? Oh, my God! Watch out!

309
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:44.299
What are you doing?

310
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.477
Oh, look out!

311
00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.774
It's not my day!

312
00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.014
My car!

313
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:57.334
- Are you all right?
- I think I'm dead.

314
00:40:57.413 --> 00:41:00.058
- You're all right. Wait for me.
- Okay.

315
00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:16.808
- Where is she, Sully?
- Kiss my ass.

316
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:17.892
I can't hear you.

317
00:41:17.917 --> 00:41:20.920
I'll say it a little louder, then.
Get fucked.

318
00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.901
Listen, your loyalty
is very touching, but it is not...

319
00:41:23.926 --> 00:41:26.681
...the most important thing
in your life right now.

320
00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:30.113
But what is important is gravity.

321
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:35.293
I have to remind you, Sully,
this is my weak arm.

322
00:41:35.368 --> 00:41:38.668
You can't kill me, Matrix.
You need me to find your daughter.

323
00:41:38.788 --> 00:41:41.758
- Where is she?
- I don't know. But Cooke knows.

324
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:43.718
I'll take you where 
I'm supposed to meet him.

325
00:41:43.743 --> 00:41:44.485
But you won't.

326
00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:47.088
- Why not?
- Because I already know.

327
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.313
Remember, Sully, 
when I promised to kill you last?

328
00:41:52.338 --> 00:41:54.067
That's right, Matrix. 
You did.

329
00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:55.392
I lied.

330
00:42:00.893 --> 00:42:02.574
So now you don't have a car.

331
00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:18.248
Now I do.

332
00:42:25.372 --> 00:42:27.774
- What'd you do with Sully?
- I let him go.

333
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.714
I'm sorry I got you 
involved in this.

334
00:43:07.835 --> 00:43:10.269
Well, why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

335
00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:13.892
- It's about her.
- Is this your daughter?

336
00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:17.019
Yeah. Some people are using her
to force me to do a job.

337
00:43:17.095 --> 00:43:19.877
If I don't get to her soon, 
they'll kill her.

338
00:43:19.902 --> 00:43:21.716
Well, did you do the job?

339
00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:24.736
No. I knew they would
kill her even if I did it.

340
00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:26.679
My only chance now
is that I get to her...

341
00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:28.430
...before they find out
what I'm doing.

342
00:43:28.481 --> 00:43:29.992
What about her mother?

343
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.951
- She died when Jenny was born.
- I'm sorry.

344
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.403
I was in Laos at the time.

345
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.249
So I came back
intending to raise her.

346
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.346
But I was never home.

347
00:43:45.251 --> 00:43:48.327
When she was three,
I was in Lebanon.

348
00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:52.672
When she was in grammar school,
I was in Angola.

349
00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:56.225
When she had the measles,
I was in Pakistan.

350
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:58.550
Now she's been kidnapped
because of me.

351
00:43:58.553 --> 00:44:00.482
Well, why did you have
to do all that traveling?

352
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:05.822
- Special assignments.
- Is that for the Army or something?

353
00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:07.778
Or something.

354
00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:11.108
What did you have to do?

355
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:14.991
Things you don't want to know about.

356
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:19.164
Things that sometimes
I wish I didn't know about.

357
00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:24.084
But that part of my life 
is over with.

358
00:44:25.246 --> 00:44:27.669
All that matters 
to me now is Jenny.

359
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:40.095
Let's go. Out.

360
00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:54.816
Stay put.

361
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.174
- What are you doing?
- Helping you get her back.

362
00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:31.126
- Look through the drawers.
- All right.

363
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.909
It's Cooke. Mess up the bed.

364
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:16.214
Remember you had a good time
with Sully. Open the door.

365
00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:19.470
All right.

366
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:26.430
Yeah?

367
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:30.307
- Where's Sully?
- In the shower.

368
00:47:31.974 --> 00:47:35.066
- Who are you?
- Room service.

369
00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:36.854
Open the door.

370
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:39.738
Move back over there.

371
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.492
Hey, Sully!

372
00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:11.434
You scared, motherfucker?

373
00:48:11.514 --> 00:48:12.557
Well, you should be,

374
00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:15.590
'cause this Green Beret's 
gonna kick your big ass.

375
00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:17.896
I eat Green Berets for breakfast.

376
00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:20.165
And right now I'm very hungry.

377
00:48:20.692 --> 00:48:22.638
I can't believe
this macho bullshit.

378
00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:42.431
Fuck you, asshole.

379
00:48:43.212 --> 00:48:45.400
Fuck you, asshole.

380
00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:51.643
These guys eat
too much red meat.

381
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:11.896
Where is she?

382
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:17.208
Cooke!

383
00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:33.819
Let's go.

384
00:49:40.728 --> 00:49:42.233
This must be Cooke's car.

385
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:46.247
Let's search it.

386
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:04.474
I think I've found something.

387
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:09.455
Look at this.

388
00:50:10.599 --> 00:50:11.726
What is this?

389
00:50:11.768 --> 00:50:14.019
Coastal is a fuel depot
that supplies planes.

390
00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:15.516
To whom? The airlines?

391
00:50:15.596 --> 00:50:18.566
- Usually smaller, private aircraft.
- Are you sure?

392
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:20.164
I'm getting my pilot's license,

393
00:50:20.166 --> 00:50:22.012
and this is where 
my instructor gets his fuel.

394
00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:24.492
There are a lot of warehouses
on Redondo Street.

395
00:50:24.813 --> 00:50:27.817
Arius must be keeping
a plane down there. Let's go.

396
00:50:28.241 --> 00:50:30.946
We'll take Cooke's car.
He won't be needing it.

397
00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:50.782
This is it. Patria Enterprises.

398
00:50:54.802 --> 00:50:57.136
I think this is where
I was this afternoon.

399
00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:15.656
- You go this way and wait for my signal.
- Okay.

400
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:09.896
- Cindy. Come on.
- Yeah.

401
00:53:17.403 --> 00:53:19.326
I've seen all the equipment
they've got,

402
00:53:19.351 --> 00:53:20.522
but there's no airplane.

403
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:23.200
- What about your daughter?
- Arius and Bennett aren't here.

404
00:53:23.283 --> 00:53:25.754
- She is wherever they are.
- Okay.

405
00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:27.421
Look at this.

406
00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:40.011
These coordinates
are somewhere near Santa Barbara.

407
00:53:46.348 --> 00:53:48.055
Longitude.

408
00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:55.942
There's something going on
at this island off the coast north of here.

409
00:53:56.024 --> 00:53:58.416
- This must be where they've taken Jenny.
- Look.

410
00:53:59.319 --> 00:54:01.709
Here's a photo 
of an amphibian airplane.

411
00:54:02.489 --> 00:54:04.065
Maybe they use it
to fly out there.

412
00:54:04.116 --> 00:54:05.973
Yeah. Let's look at that invoice.

413
00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:20.258
All right. 
Type 4 fuel is amphibian.

414
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.412
250 gallons 
is what it would take...

415
00:54:22.437 --> 00:54:24.995
...to fly this plane 
to the island and back.

416
00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:28.115
But it isn't here.
I've seen everything they've got.

417
00:54:28.807 --> 00:54:32.615
It was refueled 
at pump station 32, Pacific Pier.

418
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.086
That's San Pedro.

419
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.464
So how long does it take
to fly to the island?

420
00:54:37.489 --> 00:54:38.554
About two hours.

421
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.715
- Are we going to the plane?
- Not yet.

422
00:54:53.207 --> 00:54:55.976
- Where are we going?
- Shopping.

423
00:54:59.046 --> 00:55:00.219
Shopping?

424
00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:25.595
Come on, come on.

425
00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:51.867
- What's that?
- Rocket launcher.

426
00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:54.168
Go!

427
00:57:13.972 --> 00:57:15.143
Freeze!

428
00:57:15.155 --> 00:57:16.640
Don't even think about it!

429
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:23.207
Stick him in the truck.

430
00:57:23.232 --> 00:57:24.348
Come on. Come on.

431
00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:53.063
If you call General
Franklin Kirby,

432
00:57:53.064 --> 00:57:54.305
he will explain
everything to you.

433
00:57:54.346 --> 00:57:55.360
Kirby, huh?

434
00:57:56.061 --> 00:57:58.093
Yeah, I think we ran him in 
last week, right?

435
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.919
Hooker. Not bad.

436
00:58:32.968 --> 00:58:36.291
- What do you think she's doing?
- I think she's got something for us.

437
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:37.729
I bet she does.

438
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:47.954
Shit!

439
00:58:47.979 --> 00:58:49.626
- What the hell was that?
- God!

440
00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:53.576
Jesus Christ!

441
00:59:18.472 --> 00:59:20.413
Where did you learn
how to do that?

442
00:59:20.438 --> 00:59:22.000
I read the instructions.

443
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:31.330
What time you expect Matrix
to arrive in Val Verde?

444
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:34.033
Just over two hours.

445
00:59:34.112 --> 00:59:37.878
Do you think that he's going
to give us any problems?

446
00:59:38.033 --> 00:59:40.912
He'll do exactly as he's told...

447
00:59:40.994 --> 00:59:43.998
...as long as he thinks
he'll get his daughter back.

448
01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.172
- It's all clear.
- Good.

449
01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:00.537
Did anybody ever tell you
you have a lot of hostility?

450
01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:02.337
Come on. Let's move.

451
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.843
I hope I can fly this plane.

452
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.279
Oh, shit.

453
01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.111
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

454
01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.901
This isn't a plane.
This is a canoe with wings.

455
01:01:31.903 --> 01:01:33.671
Well, then get in
and start paddling.

456
01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:45.073
- Start the engine. Hurry up!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

457
01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:49.610
Oh, my God!

458
01:01:49.635 --> 01:01:51.972
- This plane is older than I am!
- Come on!

459
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.343
Look! 
There's no LED read-out!

460
01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:59.471
- I've only trained on a Cessna!
- Hurry up!

461
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.727
I'm trying!

462
01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.387
Shit!

463
01:02:06.647 --> 01:02:09.814
Come on, you piece of shit!
Fly or die!

464
01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.366
Works every time.

465
01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:35.130
All right. Here we go.

466
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:40.183
- Watch out for the boat.
- Oh, we're not gonna make it!

467
01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:43.010
Yes, we are.

468
01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.697
We did it. We did it.

469
01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:58.525
- Well done.
- Thank you.

470
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.532
Matrix?

471
01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.701
Call the Federal building.

472
01:03:05.726 --> 01:03:08.859
Have them monitor every police, aviation
and marine channel in the area.

473
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.958
- What are you expecting?
- World War III.

474
01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:18.274
Repeat. This is Whiskey
X-ray 448 for General Kirby.

475
01:03:18.299 --> 01:03:19.911
Urgent you respond.

476
01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.076
<i>Attention,
unidentified aircraft.</i>

477
01:03:22.101 --> 01:03:24.547
<i>This is the Coast Guard 
cutter Marauder.</i>

478
01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:27.240
You are flying over 
the San Miguel gunnery range.

479
01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:28.913
This is a highly restricted area.

480
01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.413
<i>You must change course, 
or you will be forced to land.</i>

481
01:03:31.438 --> 01:03:32.267
Acknowledge.

482
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.080
Urgent. Repeat. Urgent.

483
01:03:34.691 --> 01:03:37.339
<i>You must contact 
General Franklin Kirby.</i>

484
01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:40.498
You must first change course
or you risk being shot down.

485
01:03:40.499 --> 01:03:41.606
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

486
01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:45.660
They shoot the shit
out of this area all the time.

487
01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.383
All the flights out of LAX
avoid it like the plague.

488
01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:51.328
- Can you go below radar?
- Not marine radar.

489
01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.107
Maybe if I get us
close enough to the water,

490
01:03:53.132 --> 01:03:54.697
the waves can camouflage us.

491
01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:58.048
- Go down.
- Oh. Okay.

492
01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.003
- Do it.
- Hang on.

493
01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.519
We lost them, sir.

494
01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:53.015
Slitting a little girl's throat...

495
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.178
...is like cutting warm butter.

496
01:04:56.518 --> 01:04:58.107
Put the knife away...

497
01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.981
...and shut your mouth.

498
01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:12.043
I love listening to your little
pissant soldiers trying to talk tough.

499
01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.667
They make me laugh.

500
01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:17.829
If Matrix was here,
he'd laugh too.

501
01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:21.631
Mr. Bennett, 
my soldiers are patriots.

502
01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:23.757
Your soldiers are nothing.

503
01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.850
Matrix and I could kill
every one of them...

504
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.038
...in the blink of an eye.
Remember that.

505
01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:33.390
Are you trying to frighten me?

506
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.423
I don't have to try.

507
01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:37.906
When Matrix finishes the job,

508
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.651
he'll be back for his daughter.

509
01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:44.654
Now, whether she's alive or dead
doesn't matter.

510
01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.783
Then he'll be after you.

511
01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:50.038
Now, the only thing
between Matrix and you...

512
01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:52.991
...is me.

513
01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:58.130
It is you that is afraid, Mr. Bennett.

514
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.550
You are afraid of Matrix.

515
01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:05.675
Of course. I'm smart.

516
01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:08.496
But I have an edge.

517
01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:11.228
I have his daughter.

518
01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:19.025
- Is that it?
- That's the one.

519
01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.247
Land here.

520
01:06:24.444 --> 01:06:26.681
It's the most 
isolated spot we'll find.

521
01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.030
Okay. Here we go.

522
01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.593
Now, you remember the message.

523
01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:23.628
Commando, Kirby,
Code Red, coordinates. Got it.

524
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.842
Don't break radio silence
until they see me.

525
01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.385
How will I know?

526
01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.438
Because all fucking hell
is gonna break loose.

527
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.534
Be careful, Matrix. Good luck.

528
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.151
Thanks.

529
01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.886
He was not on the plane.

530
01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:47.683
Kill her.

531
01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:49.364
Welcome back, John.

532
01:12:49.828 --> 01:12:51.522
So glad you could make it.

533
01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:11.934
You little... bitch!

534
01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.087
My God!

535
01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:13.675
Commando. I say again, Commando.
This is Whiskey X-ray 448.

536
01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:17.492
I have an emergency priority message
for a General Franklin Kirby.

537
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.497
I repeat, General Franklin Kirby.

538
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.635
General Kirby, you'd better get out here.
We have your message on the Teletype.

539
01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:25.354
Jenny!

540
01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.327
Jenny?

541
01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:34.698
Jenny!

542
01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:50.080
Daddy?

543
01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:26.188
Jenny!

544
01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:32.608
Daddy?

545
01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.232
Daddy?

546
01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.117
Jenny!

547
01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:41.067
Daddy?

548
01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:44.986
No. Not Daddy.

549
01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:47.205
Come on!

550
01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.104
Dady?

551
01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.630
John! How's your arm, John?

552
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:07.215
- Come over and find out.
- No, thanks. I think I'll take a pass.

553
01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:10.638
John, stick your head out.

554
01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:13.220
One shot, 
right between the eyes.

555
01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:16.307
I'll make it quick.
Just for old times' sake.

556
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.354
Bennett, stop screwing around
and let the girl go.

557
01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:24.301
It's me that you want.
I have only one arm. You can beat me.

558
01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:30.079
Come on, Bennett.
Throw away that chickenshit gun.

559
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.409
You don't just want 
to pull a trigger.

560
01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:39.058
You want to put a knife in me
and look me in the eye,

561
01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:42.717
and see what's going on in there
when you turn it.

562
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:46.221
- That's what you want to do, right?
- I'll kill you, John.

563
01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:49.344
Let the girl go. 
It's between you and me.

564
01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:51.728
Don't deprive yourself
of some pleasure.

565
01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:55.433
Come on, Bennett. Let's party.

566
01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.813
- I can beat you.
- No.

567
01:22:57.983 --> 01:23:00.062
I don't need the girl.

568
01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.936
I don't need the girl!

569
01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:07.906
I don't need the gun, John.
I can beat you.

570
01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.124
I don't need no gun!

571
01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:14.790
I'm gonna kill you now!

572
01:23:35.385 --> 01:23:37.052
You're getting old, John.

573
01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:40.234
You're getting old.

574
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:21.622
John, I feel good!
Just like old times.

575
01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:24.970
What's it feel like
to be a dying man?

576
01:25:25.255 --> 01:25:27.012
You're a dead man, John!

577
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:28.799
Bullshit!

578
01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:40.144
John, I'm not gonna shoot you
between the eyes!

579
01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:43.097
I'm gonna shoot you
between the balls!

580
01:25:57.778 --> 01:25:59.862
Let off some steam, Bennett.

581
01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:05.251
Daddy.

582
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:48.258
Move out!

583
01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:27.156
- Leave anything for us?
- Just bodies.

584
01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.415
I'd just like you to start up 
your unit again, John.

585
01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.022
All it would take
is your coming back.

586
01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:34.086
This was the last time.

587
01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:46.734
Until the next time.

588
01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.486
No chance.
