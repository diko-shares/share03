2
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.172
That's a nasty habit.

3
00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:50.143
I did things that I swore.

4
00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:55.081
Were never gonna
know in my life.

5
00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:05.158
I won't even see her again.

6
00:06:09.996 --> 00:06:10.830
My

7
00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:14.133
baby was gone.

8
00:06:17.637 --> 00:06:19.304
I had nothing.

9
00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:28.346
I thought about ending it all.

10
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.258
Every morning,

11
00:06:41.594 --> 00:06:43.996
I had to come up with
a reason not to do it.

12
00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:47.233
And then one morning,

13
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.235
bam.

14
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.112
I just couldn't find a reason.

15
00:07:04.684 --> 00:07:06.853
I was just about to do it.

16
00:07:13.025 --> 00:07:13.860
That call.

17
00:07:17.797 --> 00:07:18.631
Bill

18
00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:20.733
then Robbie.

19
00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:30.408
He said he wanted to try again.

20
00:07:30.443 --> 00:07:33.779
It was like a sun
beam shot directly in.

21
00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:42.355
Lit up my heart like
the 4th of July.

22
00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:48.226
You remember when
we used to touch

23
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:50.296
listenin' Sheryl
Crow in the kitchen?

24
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:53.532
You used to dance on my feet,

25
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:57.503
tap out the beat on my hip
with your little fingers.

26
00:08:01.974 --> 00:08:04.076
"Soak Up the
Sun" still my favorite song.

27
00:08:12.518 --> 00:08:15.286
Yeah, I know
I have a problem.

28
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:19.926
I'ma be good now.

29
00:08:21.227 --> 00:08:22.461
If I get clean,

30
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.933
I'm not just asking.

31
00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:31.137
I'm pleading with you now.

32
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:33.406
Please

33
00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.544
just gimme one more chance.

34
00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:42.647
One more chance.

35
00:08:42.682 --> 00:08:44.749
He was the one great
thing I got left.

36
00:09:56.756 --> 00:09:57.590
Hey dad.

37
00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:09.035
I don't know why you
seem so surprised.

38
00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:11.837
Mom tried calling you.

39
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.111
You're drinking again.

40
00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:26.852
I know.

41
00:10:36.562 --> 00:10:39.330
Mom thought this
would be good for us,

42
00:10:39.365 --> 00:10:42.101
for me to come up here before
I go to school in London.

43
00:10:45.137 --> 00:10:47.206
She wouldn't want this.

44
00:10:49.241 --> 00:10:50.042
What?

45
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.830
Yes.

46
00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:13.699
London.

47
00:11:16.436 --> 00:11:17.269
I got in

48
00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:19.539
to the Royal College of Art.

49
00:11:21.407 --> 00:11:23.008
I'm doing my MBA in photography.

50
00:11:25.177 --> 00:11:26.011
Don't.

51
00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:56.942
That erm, that probably
needs changing.

52
00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:03.643
I'm goin' to bed.

00:15:22.482 --> 00:15:26.718

00:15:26.753 --> 00:15:28.720

I need your WiFi code.

58
00:23:13.351 --> 00:23:15.420
Forgot this place is
a fucking dead zone

59
00:23:17.757 --> 00:23:19.158
and it's time for your meds.

60
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:43.950
So how much
of that was true?

61
00:23:48.187 --> 00:23:50.156
Enough for
me to sound convince...

62
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.232
Do you have internet?

63
00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:41.239
What?

64
00:24:41.274 --> 00:24:42.407
Wasn't me.

65
00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:45.578
I mean you are on a
shit ton of painkillers.

66
00:25:13.873 --> 00:25:14.707
Seriously?

67
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:17.777
Can't you fix it?

68
00:25:22.415 --> 00:25:23.249
Fuck.

69
00:25:45.905 --> 00:25:46.739
Fine.

70
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.085
Are we joking?

71
00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:04.322
Well this place has a
backup generator, right?

72
00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:16.736
Great.

73
00:28:30.302 --> 00:28:31.137
Ready?

74
00:28:55.027 --> 00:28:56.727
700.

75
00:28:56.762 --> 00:28:57.597
Pay up.

76
00:29:06.705 --> 00:29:07.673
Drink your dinner.

77
00:29:27.594 --> 00:29:28.428
It's your turn.

78
00:29:42.174 --> 00:29:44.176
And I want you to
drink your dinner.

79
00:30:14.641 --> 00:30:16.576
That's not true.

80
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.260
You know, I really think
you need to eat something.

81
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.361
You're gonna talk about lying?

82
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.131
You?

83
00:31:14.199 --> 00:31:16.701
You wanna talk about lying, dad?

84
00:31:16.736 --> 00:31:17.636
Okay, yeah.

85
00:31:17.671 --> 00:31:18.871
Yeah, let's talk about lying.

86
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.207
Let's talk about how
from the ages of 10 to 18

87
00:31:23.242 --> 00:31:25.175
I didn't see you after 6:00 p.m.

88
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.578
because you were out writing

89
00:31:26.613 --> 00:31:28.413
when really you were
getting shitfaced

90
00:31:28.448 --> 00:31:31.317
and pissin' away all of our
family's money at the casino.

91
00:31:32.686 --> 00:31:34.151
Let's talk about
the burner phones

92
00:31:34.186 --> 00:31:36.854
and all the dating profiles
that you had under fake names

93
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:39.492
so you can communicate to
your dozens of mistresses.

94
00:31:42.429 --> 00:31:44.596
Or how about the
time when you told me

95
00:31:44.631 --> 00:31:46.297
that mom's bruises on her face

96
00:31:46.332 --> 00:31:48.200
were from her falling
down the stairs?

97
00:31:51.904 --> 00:31:52.871
Shall I keep going?

98
00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:55.939
or should I name one of
the thousands of things

99
00:31:55.974 --> 00:31:59.713
that you've done and you never
even once apologized for?

100
00:32:02.749 --> 00:32:03.583
You know,

101
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:08.455
this was an opportunity for
us to make up for lost time.

102
00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:11.922
I'm here because my mom,

103
00:32:11.957 --> 00:32:15.893
the parent who actually
raised me asked me to.

104
00:32:15.928 --> 00:32:16.763
That's it.

105
00:32:26.473 --> 00:32:27.306
Goodnight.

106
00:35:36.863 --> 00:35:39.298
Jesus Christ.

107
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:45.102
Shh!

108
00:35:45.137 --> 00:35:46.338
Preston, shut up.

109
00:35:47.406 --> 00:35:48.675
Jesus Christ.

110
00:35:49.709 --> 00:35:50.508
You're a fucking idiot.

111
00:35:50.543 --> 00:35:51.809
You know that, right?

112
00:35:51.844 --> 00:35:53.913
Yeah, I think we
already knew that.

113
00:35:58.083 --> 00:35:59.316
I'm not laughing.

114
00:35:59.351 --> 00:36:01.285
Baby, you gotta ease up.

115
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.787
And you made us late.

116
00:36:02.822 --> 00:36:04.724
It's not my fault you
looked in the wrong place.

117
00:36:12.532 --> 00:36:13.800
Everything goin' to plan?

118
00:36:15.034 --> 00:36:16.601
I put the pill in his drink,

119
00:36:16.636 --> 00:36:18.203
but I didn't see him drink it.

120
00:36:20.807 --> 00:36:22.307
You didn't see him drink it?

121
00:36:23.476 --> 00:36:24.877
No, but that doesn't
mean he didn't.

122
00:36:29.616 --> 00:36:31.281
Okay.

123
00:36:31.316 --> 00:36:32.817
Okay.

124
00:36:32.852 --> 00:36:35.922
We'll just have to prepare for
the fact that he may not have

125
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.156
and act accordingly.

126
00:36:39.191 --> 00:36:40.026
Fine.

127
00:36:41.661 --> 00:36:42.829
We don't hurt him.

128
00:36:46.966 --> 00:36:48.198
You're not getting
cold feet, are you?

129
00:36:48.233 --> 00:36:49.434
No, I just-

130
00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:50.970
- We've come too far
to get cold feet now.

131
00:36:53.171 --> 00:36:55.608
Does this look like
I'm getting fuckin' cold feet?

132
00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:00.847
- Fine.
- Good.

133
00:37:19.231 --> 00:37:21.134
You're the only thing
that keeps me sane.

134
00:37:25.705 --> 00:37:27.573
I don't know what I'd
do if you ever left me.

135
00:37:31.511 --> 00:37:33.846
You know I love you, right?

136
00:37:35.748 --> 00:37:37.381
- I love you more.
- No.

137
00:37:37.416 --> 00:37:38.483
- Yeah.
- No.

138
00:37:38.518 --> 00:37:40.551
- Yeah.
- Mm-mmm.

139
00:37:40.586 --> 00:37:42.387
Mm-hmm.

140
00:41:13.733 --> 00:41:14.734
Where is he?

141
00:41:25.878 --> 00:41:27.647
Shit.

142
00:42:02.014 --> 00:42:03.182
It's so cute.

143
00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.518
I almost feel bad emptying it.

144
00:42:09.155 --> 00:42:10.056
I said almost.

145
00:42:16.062 --> 00:42:17.495
What are you doing?

146
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.531
I'm trying your birthday.

147
00:42:20.566 --> 00:42:23.334
You really
think that's gonna work?

148
00:42:23.369 --> 00:42:25.938
Well people are a lot less
imaginative for these things.

149
00:42:34.847 --> 00:42:35.681
Shit.

150
00:42:37.817 --> 00:42:38.751
Are we surprised?

151
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.289
He's not here.

152
00:42:45.324 --> 00:42:47.091
'Kay, relax.

153
00:42:47.126 --> 00:42:48.961
It still doesn't mean
that he didn't take it.

154
00:42:52.498 --> 00:42:53.564
I wanna check downstairs.

155
00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:54.400
Hey.

156
00:42:55.868 --> 00:42:56.669
You good?

157
00:42:57.603 --> 00:42:58.502
Yeah.

158
00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:06.493
Dear Em,

159
00:46:10.296 --> 00:46:12.932
it's been years since we've
last had a conversation.

160
00:46:14.568 --> 00:46:17.502
Well a conversation
that lasted longer

161
00:46:17.537 --> 00:46:18.837
than a few words anyway

162
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:26.812
and that's no one
else's fault but my own.

163
00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:32.418
I've failed you

164
00:46:35.354 --> 00:46:36.789
not only as a man

165
00:46:43.563 --> 00:46:44.797
but as a parent

166
00:46:46.232 --> 00:46:47.667
and a role model.

167
00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.519
I wanna make things right.

168
00:47:08.488 --> 00:47:11.458
I will do anything
to make things right.

169
00:47:28.874 --> 00:47:30.477
You have every right to hate me.

170
00:47:34.813 --> 00:47:35.914
I would hate me too.

171
00:47:40.453 --> 00:47:41.287
I hope.

172
00:48:45.918 --> 00:48:47.152
Hi daddy.

173
00:50:04.697 --> 00:50:06.231
Shut the fuck up.

174
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.546
The great Reed Rodney.

175
00:50:21.146 --> 00:50:22.916
Oh by the way, read
"Countdown to Kill".

176
00:50:24.617 --> 00:50:25.817
Really bad.

177
00:50:25.852 --> 00:50:27.319
'Kay, let's just
get this over with.

178
00:50:28.721 --> 00:50:30.622
I understand.

179
00:50:30.657 --> 00:50:33.158
I'd probably be pretty
confused too if I were you.

180
00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:36.128
In your position,

181
00:50:37.464 --> 00:50:39.064
I'd have a crap
ton of questions.

182
00:50:40.132 --> 00:50:40.934
Who am I?

183
00:50:43.937 --> 00:50:46.338
What's your darling baby
girl doing tying you up?

184
00:50:47.941 --> 00:50:50.442
How the hell did
all of this happen?

185
00:50:50.477 --> 00:50:52.579
Right under your nose
without you noticing.

186
00:50:54.279 --> 00:50:56.048
I've seen the safe.

187
00:50:57.517 --> 00:50:58.451
I know you have it.

188
00:51:00.687 --> 00:51:02.020
Let's not go down that road.

189
00:51:05.324 --> 00:51:06.325
What I need from you

190
00:51:08.728 --> 00:51:10.229
is the combination to open it.

191
00:51:11.431 --> 00:51:13.598
We're gonna empty your safe.

192
00:51:13.633 --> 00:51:15.133
We're gonna leave.

193
00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:16.936
Simple.

194
00:51:21.039 --> 00:51:23.541
I'm gonna warn you
right here, right now.

195
00:51:23.576 --> 00:51:25.375
I am not

196
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:26.644
a patient person.

197
00:51:26.679 --> 00:51:29.081
So if you don't do
exactly as I say,

198
00:51:32.485 --> 00:51:34.152
let's just not do that.

199
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.424
If you look at my
girl like that again,

200
00:51:39.459 --> 00:51:41.626
you're gonna need a lot
more than those braces

201
00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:43.295
and elastics you got in there.

202
00:51:49.502 --> 00:51:50.267
Those are my terms.

203
00:51:50.302 --> 00:51:51.736
What do you say?

204
00:52:01.681 --> 00:52:02.515
Reed?

205
00:52:05.885 --> 00:52:07.219
The combination.

206
00:52:14.192 --> 00:52:15.193
Fair enough.

207
00:52:22.035 --> 00:52:23.233
Hey!

208
00:52:23.268 --> 00:52:24.134
The fuck are you doin'?

209
00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:25.603
What'd I say?

210
00:52:25.638 --> 00:52:27.672
- This is fuckin'-
- I'm in control here,

211
00:52:27.707 --> 00:52:28.541
not you.

212
00:52:30.242 --> 00:52:31.343
Relax.

213
00:52:34.647 --> 00:52:35.847
Fine.

214
00:52:55.568 --> 00:52:57.804
This is not how it
was supposed to go.

215
00:52:59.005 --> 00:53:00.673
You were supposed to
drink the syringe.

216
00:53:01.841 --> 00:53:03.708
You were supposed
to be so drugged up

217
00:53:03.743 --> 00:53:06.345
that you wouldn't even
understood what was going on.

218
00:53:07.614 --> 00:53:08.846
By the time you even realize

219
00:53:08.881 --> 00:53:11.148
that you've given
us the combination,

220
00:53:11.183 --> 00:53:12.452
we would've been long gone.

221
00:53:23.429 --> 00:53:24.430
I found your letter.

222
00:53:28.534 --> 00:53:29.535
It was surprisingly

223
00:53:31.236 --> 00:53:32.071
honest.

224
00:53:34.206 --> 00:53:35.707
Em.

225
00:53:35.742 --> 00:53:36.841
Em?

226
00:53:36.876 --> 00:53:39.078
Don't let this fuckhead
manipulate you.

227
00:53:40.513 --> 00:53:42.381
You said you wanted to
make things right with me.

228
00:53:43.348 --> 00:53:44.851
This is your last chance.

229
00:53:47.185 --> 00:53:50.521
Are you actually
falling for this shit?

230
00:53:50.556 --> 00:53:51.889
He doesn't give
a shit about you.

231
00:53:51.924 --> 00:53:53.026
He never has!

232
00:53:57.262 --> 00:53:59.032
Did you really
mean what you said?

233
00:54:03.136 --> 00:54:04.137
Goddammit.

234
00:54:07.907 --> 00:54:08.741
Preston,

235
00:54:09.876 --> 00:54:11.878
where did you get a gun?

236
00:54:13.579 --> 00:54:15.278
He doesn't love you.

237
00:54:15.313 --> 00:54:16.414
Think about what you're doing.

238
00:54:16.449 --> 00:54:18.618
I know exactly what I'm doing.

239
00:54:20.019 --> 00:54:22.386
I'm not gonna let
you ruin this plan

240
00:54:22.421 --> 00:54:25.123
by thinking he's anything
other than a sack of shit.

241
00:54:25.158 --> 00:54:26.526
I'm not ruining anything.

242
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.294
You don't know what
I was thinking.

243
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:32.230
So just put the gun down.

244
00:54:33.766 --> 00:54:34.967
You'll thank me later.

245
00:54:36.602 --> 00:54:38.037
What's the combination, Reed?

246
00:54:39.237 --> 00:54:40.805
If you're tryin' to
prove your love to me,

247
00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.106
this is not how you do it.

248
00:54:42.141 --> 00:54:45.210
I'm gonna count
down from three.

249
00:54:48.047 --> 00:54:49.113
Three.

250
00:54:49.148 --> 00:54:50.016
Preston!

251
00:54:51.918 --> 00:54:53.451
♪ Two ♪

252
00:54:53.486 --> 00:54:55.088
Preston, stop it!

253
00:55:00.026 --> 00:55:02.393
Preston, I need you to calm down

254
00:55:02.428 --> 00:55:04.062
and think about
what you're doing.

255
00:55:04.097 --> 00:55:06.464
Okay, shooting him
complicates everything.

256
00:55:06.499 --> 00:55:07.999
Get out of my way.

257
00:55:08.034 --> 00:55:10.368
Not until you calm down
and see things rationally.

258
00:55:13.439 --> 00:55:14.874
Do you love me?

259
00:55:16.341 --> 00:55:17.675
Do you love me?

260
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:19.444
What are you talking about?

261
00:55:19.479 --> 00:55:21.714
If you love me, prove it.

262
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.718
Get out of the way.

263
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.188
Let me do this right now.

264
00:55:34.927 --> 00:55:35.762
I can't.

265
00:55:56.916 --> 00:55:58.116
I gotta give it to you.

266
00:55:58.151 --> 00:55:58.985
You have

267
00:56:00.186 --> 00:56:02.086
a beautiful home.

268
00:56:02.121 --> 00:56:06.023
I mean the elevator's a
little fuckin' ridiculous.

269
00:56:06.058 --> 00:56:07.527
Sorry for the rude awakening.

270
00:56:09.662 --> 00:56:12.431
Guess I got tired of
waiting.

271
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:14.799
I'll tell you one thing.

272
00:56:14.834 --> 00:56:16.467
Your situation?

273
00:56:16.502 --> 00:56:18.736
Well it's not that great.

274
00:56:19.906 --> 00:56:20.972
Sorry, honeybunch.

275
00:56:21.007 --> 00:56:23.007
Could you repeat that for me?

276
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:25.076
I'm havin' a
hard time hearing you.

277
00:56:25.111 --> 00:56:27.046
One more time?

278
00:56:37.089 --> 00:56:38.758
Take a goddamn chill pill.

279
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.368
Em, Em, Em, Em, Em, Em, Em.

280
00:57:00.378 --> 00:57:01.581
You stabbed me.

281
00:57:03.149 --> 00:57:05.151
You stabbed me in the
shoulder with a pen.

282
00:57:10.122 --> 00:57:11.956
God. You know, I
wasn't even gonna hurt you.

283
00:57:15.027 --> 00:57:17.263
I just wanted you
to fuckin' move!

284
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:24.904
But that ship has

285
00:57:26.205 --> 00:57:27.073
long sailed.

286
00:57:29.609 --> 00:57:31.043
Now you're right there

287
00:57:32.245 --> 00:57:33.378
in with him.

288
00:57:36.282 --> 00:57:37.215
Whore.

289
00:57:50.129 --> 00:57:51.395
What do you want?

290
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:52.563
Yes.

291
00:57:58.137 --> 00:57:59.369
I hate fathers.

292
00:57:59.404 --> 00:58:00.339
Oh god.

293
00:58:02.742 --> 00:58:05.344
They always find a way to
fuck everything up for me.

294
00:58:11.684 --> 00:58:13.651
You wanna know somethin', Reed?

295
00:58:13.686 --> 00:58:15.853
I met your daughter

296
00:58:15.888 --> 00:58:17.321
one year,

297
00:58:17.356 --> 00:58:19.056
263 days

298
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:21.060
and 14 hours ago.

299
00:58:22.428 --> 00:58:24.664
Now I'm not for mushiness
and sentimentality.

300
00:58:26.132 --> 00:58:30.903
But from the moment I met her,
I knew my life had changed.

301
00:58:35.174 --> 00:58:36.676
Remember that first night out?

302
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.544
You remember.

303
00:58:39.545 --> 00:58:41.080
That stupid little bar.

304
00:58:42.248 --> 00:58:46.317
We sat and talked
for what, six hours?

305
00:58:46.352 --> 00:58:49.822
Six hours straight.

306
00:58:52.892 --> 00:58:55.226
I mean I don't think
I've ever sat that still

307
00:58:55.261 --> 00:58:57.363
for that long my entire life.

308
00:58:58.597 --> 00:58:59.765
I don't think I ever would've.

309
00:59:23.322 --> 00:59:24.657
And to be frank,

310
00:59:27.093 --> 00:59:29.095
I think you fell
pretty hard for me too.

311
00:59:42.008 --> 00:59:43.709
I know everything
about you, Reed.

312
00:59:45.544 --> 00:59:46.379
Everything.

313
00:59:48.514 --> 00:59:50.416
You're just like my old man.

314
00:59:52.618 --> 00:59:56.555
Only difference is you got
nicer clothes, fancy car.

315
00:59:59.525 --> 01:00:03.062
And you hit your wife
instead of your kid.

316
01:00:19.612 --> 01:00:22.913
You know what the
kicker to all this is?

317
01:00:22.948 --> 01:00:24.050
This whole thing,

318
01:00:26.252 --> 01:00:27.086
it's her idea.

319
01:00:29.255 --> 01:00:30.089
Mm-hmm.

320
01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.463
Tie you up, robbed blind.

321
01:00:38.998 --> 01:00:41.198
Use it to start a new life.

322
01:00:41.233 --> 01:00:42.635
Ain't that right?

323
01:00:47.873 --> 01:00:50.709
Fresh identities, new
house, the works, you know.

324
01:00:53.712 --> 01:00:56.680
Come to think of it, she
even came up with this lie,

325
01:00:56.715 --> 01:01:00.052
about getting into
school in London.

326
01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:03.222
Yeah.

327
01:01:05.191 --> 01:01:06.792
That was a good one.

328
01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:11.531
Hmm.

329
01:01:13.933 --> 01:01:16.268
Maybe I'm just waitin' for
that absolute right moment.

330
01:01:17.703 --> 01:01:20.306
Now I mean when Em heard
about your little accident,

331
01:01:22.408 --> 01:01:23.943
all systems were go.

332
01:01:33.686 --> 01:01:35.020
Darling, please.

333
01:01:36.956 --> 01:01:38.290
The men are having a drink.

334
01:01:47.266 --> 01:01:48.568
Here's lookin' at you, kid.

335
01:01:59.613 --> 01:02:03.380
Wow, rich alcoholics

336
01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:07.019
really have the
best taste in booze.

337
01:02:08.254 --> 01:02:09.088
Mmm.

338
01:02:11.323 --> 01:02:12.158
It's your turn.

339
01:02:24.904 --> 01:02:28.475
♪ Here comes the choo-choo ♪

340
01:02:52.532 --> 01:02:53.797
That was great.

341
01:02:53.832 --> 01:02:55.266
Really great, guys.

342
01:02:55.301 --> 01:02:56.068
Really good.

343
01:02:57.703 --> 01:03:01.238
The biggest takeaway is
this is 100% your fault.

344
01:03:01.273 --> 01:03:02.541
You made your bed.

345
01:03:02.576 --> 01:03:04.810
Now you're gonna lie in it.

346
01:03:13.052 --> 01:03:14.386
Yeah, it's okay.

347
01:03:15.455 --> 01:03:16.288
How's it feel?

348
01:03:18.257 --> 01:03:19.091
Huh?

349
01:03:21.561 --> 01:03:22.962
How does it feel?

350
01:03:24.096 --> 01:03:26.363
I mean you're such a
worthless piece of shit

351
01:03:26.398 --> 01:03:29.434
that your own daughter
would take you hostage

352
01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:30.437
and rob you.

353
01:03:32.572 --> 01:03:34.740
I mean even
to a guy like me,

354
01:03:36.742 --> 01:03:37.711
that's bad, man.

355
01:03:39.211 --> 01:03:40.211
Yeah.

356
01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:45.751
Gimme the combination, Reed.

357
01:03:49.556 --> 01:03:52.122
Gimme the combination, Reed.

358
01:03:59.932 --> 01:04:02.034
Do you wanna know what
your daughter tasted like?

359
01:04:04.103 --> 01:04:05.869
It wasn't that bad.

360
01:04:11.343 --> 01:04:12.510
That's okay.

361
01:04:12.545 --> 01:04:13.779
I'm gonna let you
use your imagination.

362
01:04:15.682 --> 01:04:17.651
But I will tell you

363
01:04:18.618 --> 01:04:21.653
that she loved getting fucked.

364
01:04:21.688 --> 01:04:23.422
I mean really loved it.

365
01:04:25.659 --> 01:04:26.959
Isn't that right, sweetie?

366
01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:39.136
Yeah.

367
01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:40.005
Mmm, yeah.

368
01:04:57.691 --> 01:05:00.292
All right, let's get
to the good stuff.

369
01:05:05.498 --> 01:05:07.931
You got somethin' to
tell me now, Reed?

370
01:05:07.966 --> 01:05:08.767
Yeah.

371
01:05:08.802 --> 01:05:09.601
Oh.

372
01:05:09.636 --> 01:05:10.470
Yeah, you do.

373
01:05:13.405 --> 01:05:14.539
What is it, buddy?

374
01:05:14.574 --> 01:05:15.407
Let it out.

375
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:18.578
Mm-hmm, that's a three.

376
01:05:22.482 --> 01:05:23.315
14.

377
01:05:34.893 --> 01:05:37.595
That wasn't so hard, was it?

378
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:38.663
Fuck.

379
01:05:43.135 --> 01:05:44.103
Come here, you.

380
01:05:49.942 --> 01:05:51.241
Let me help you, sweetie.

381
01:06:15.802 --> 01:06:16.636
Baby.

382
01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:19.203
Long time no see.

383
01:06:21.006 --> 01:06:24.642
No!

384
01:12:05.383 --> 01:12:06.753
You gonna shoot me, Reed?

385
01:12:17.497 --> 01:12:18.798
You're not gonna shoot me.

386
01:12:21.868 --> 01:12:23.836
I kept a little
souvenir for myself.

387
01:12:28.273 --> 01:12:30.441
It's her wedding ring finger.

388
01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:32.178
Now nobody else can have her.

389
01:12:35.114 --> 01:12:36.582
Now maybe I can
actually find somebody

390
01:12:39.752 --> 01:12:40.720
who appreciates me.

391
01:12:45.658 --> 01:12:47.325
Have you ever
taken a life, Reed?

392
01:12:48.594 --> 01:12:49.896
You know what it feels like,

393
01:12:51.063 --> 01:12:52.832
to stop a beating heart
with your two hands?

394
01:12:57.236 --> 01:12:59.871
Have you ever looked
in a man's eyes?

395
01:12:59.906 --> 01:13:00.907
Look in mine.

396
01:13:03.242 --> 01:13:04.742
And knowin' what it looks like

397
01:13:04.777 --> 01:13:09.414
when it all comes crashing
down like a house of cards.

398
01:13:14.352 --> 01:13:15.188
I have, man.

399
01:13:21.127 --> 01:13:22.393
Hey Reed, lemme tell
you something, man.

400
01:13:33.139 --> 01:13:33.973
Run!

401
01:14:25.157 --> 01:14:26.389
C'mon.

402
01:14:26.424 --> 01:14:27.260
Move!

403
01:14:33.666 --> 01:14:34.465

Dad!

418
01:23:15.655 --> 01:23:18.323
Now you're gonna
watch her cut her throat.

419
01:28:18.991 --> 01:28:23.062
Every day for the
better part of my life,

420
01:28:25.198 --> 01:28:30.036
I've had this burning fire
in the pit of my stomach.

421
01:28:33.206 --> 01:28:36.674
My hatred, my complete
and utter rage for you

422
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:38.511
in everything that
you've ever done,

423
01:28:41.313 --> 01:28:42.314
it never leaves.

424
01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.722
It's created this
hole in my insides.

425
01:28:51.023 --> 01:28:52.190
And it's there when I wake up,

426
01:28:52.225 --> 01:28:53.558
it's there when I go to bed

427
01:28:53.593 --> 01:28:56.361
and it affects everything
I do in my life.

428
01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:07.305
These past few weeks, I've
been doing a lotta thinking

429
01:29:09.075 --> 01:29:11.778
about who I am and
who I wanna be.

430
01:29:16.281 --> 01:29:18.649
And I used to fantasize
about the robbery

431
01:29:18.684 --> 01:29:22.287
and how it would somehow
fill that void.

432
01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:25.124
But I know that

433
01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:30.196
it would've just made
everything so much worse.

434
01:29:34.901 --> 01:29:37.436
More importantly though,
I realized something else.

435
01:29:39.304 --> 01:29:42.542
I am sick and I'm tired
of being so angry.

436
01:29:45.745 --> 01:29:47.880
I don't know if I'll
be able to forgive you

437
01:29:49.048 --> 01:29:50.683
for the things you
did growing up.

438
01:29:56.489 --> 01:30:01.494
If you are serious about
being a different person,

439
01:30:08.935 --> 01:30:09.836
then so am I.

440
01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:17.109
What do you say, dad?

441
01:30:38.865 --> 01:30:39.932
What is this?

442
01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.668
Is this your new book?

443
01:32:34.342 --> 01:32:39.342
