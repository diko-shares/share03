Every day for the
better part of my life,

621
01:28:25.198 --> 01:28:30.036
I've had this burning fire
in the pit of my stomach.

622
01:28:33.206 --> 01:28:36.674
My hatred, my complete
and utter rage for you

623
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:38.511
in everything that
you've ever done,

624
01:28:41.313 --> 01:28:42.314
it never leaves.

625
01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.722
It's created this
hole in my insides.

626
01:28:51.023 --> 01:28:52.190
And it's there when I wake up,

627
01:28:52.225 --> 01:28:53.558
it's there when I go to bed

628
01:28:53.593 --> 01:28:56.361
and it affects everything
I do in my life.

629
01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:07.305
These past few weeks, I've
been doing a lotta thinking

630
01:29:09.075 --> 01:29:11.778
about who I am and
who I wanna be.

631
01:29:16.281 --> 01:29:18.649
And I used to fantasize
about the robbery

632
01:29:18.684 --> 01:29:22.287
and how it would somehow
fill that void. [weeps]

633
01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:25.124
But I know that

634
01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:30.196
it would've just made
everything so much worse.

635
01:29:34.901 --> 01:29:37.436
More importantly though,
I realized something else.

636
01:29:39.304 --> 01:29:42.542
I am sick and I'm tired
of being so angry.

637
01:29:45.745 --> 01:29:47.880
I don't know if I'll
be able to forgive you

638
01:29:49.048 --> 01:29:50.683
for the things you
did growing up.

639
01:29:56.489 --> 01:30:01.494

being a different person,

643
01:30:38.865 --> 01:30:39.932
What is this?

644
01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.668
Is this your new book?
