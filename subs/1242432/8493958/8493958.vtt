00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.193
Hello.

2
00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:19.643
- Hello.
- I'm coming!

3
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.287
I'm coming.

4
00:01:24.607 --> 00:01:25.569
Hi.

5
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.562
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.

6
00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:31.794
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.

7
00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.726
Mockingbird Trail, right?

8
00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:35.142
That is right.

9
00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:40.893
I don't suppose you know how
to get out there.

10
00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:42.899
No, I don't.

11
00:01:47.258 --> 00:01:48.651
Well, listen up.

12
00:01:50.358 --> 00:01:51.767
It's a bit tricky.

13
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.888
- Keys.
- Thank you.

14
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.827
These arrows
will get you through town.

15
00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:00.651
Over here

16
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.728
there are more
dirt roads and woods.

17
00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.936
Your cabin's a real beaut.

18
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.894
But heck, there ain't another
for a good country mile.

19
00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.414
I am looking forward
to the peace and quiet.

20
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.281
I'm actually a novelist
and I'm starting my next book here.

21
00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:15.231
If that's what you're aiming for.

22
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.944
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.873
Howdy, ma'am.

24
00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:34.481
Excuse me.

25
00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:36.487
I didn't mean to frighten you.

26
00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:38.525
No, that is okay.

27
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.343
You know what?
I am actually lost.

28
00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:43.315
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.

29
00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:45.636
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.

30
00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:47.360
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.

31
00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:48.885
It's about 10 miles back.

32
00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.371
It's gonna be
on your left-hand side.

33
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.106
Gonna make a left
after a big red mailbox.

34
00:03:54.387 --> 00:03:56.608
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.

35
00:03:57.122 --> 00:03:59.994
You staying over in that cabin
on Mockingbird?

36
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.039
- Yeah.
- Fancy!

37
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.503
So you know you're running
a little hot.

38
00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:14.545
Maybe I should check up
under your hood for you.

39
00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:20.998
How's that line
working for you?

40
00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:24.164
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?

41
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:34.333
- I got that.
- No, I got it.

42
00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:36.030
No, I got it.

43
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:37.363
Oh shit.

44
00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:41.957
I'm sorry, my bad.

45
00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:44.410
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.464
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

47
00:04:46.563 --> 00:04:48.851
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.

48
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.481
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.

49
00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.635
- Okay.
- All right?

50
00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:57.105
Keep the change.

51
00:05:08.884 --> 00:05:10.906
Got you that time, Johnny.

52
00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.862
Bye-bye.

53
00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:00.500
<i>How's the writing coming?</i>

54
00:08:00.572 --> 00:08:01.911
You kidding me?

55
00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:04.351
I should have come out here
on my first book.

56
00:08:04.572 --> 00:08:05.860
<i>You gonna come back
for Hertz's party?</i>

57
00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:09.680
<i>Jen? Did I lose you?</i>

58
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:11.677
Oh, sorry.
Something just--

59
00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:14.610
<i>Hey.</i>

60
00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.889
<i>- You still there?</i>
- Barb, hold on a second.

61
00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:32.114
<i>- Jen, what's going on?</i>
- Let me call you back.

62
00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:38.412
You've got to be kidding me.

63
00:09:42.258 --> 00:09:44.247
Way to go, Jennifer.

64
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.026
Ugh.

65
00:12:22.678 --> 00:12:23.689
Ew!

66
00:12:36.484 --> 00:12:37.827
No, it won't flush.

67
00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:39.855
<i>Did you check the seal
on the flapper?</i>

68
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.553
I did that already.

69
00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:43.528
<i>- You did?</i>
- Yes.

70
00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:46.959
Look, I'm really in a spot here.

71
00:12:47.341 --> 00:12:49.043
<i>- All right, I'll send somebody.</i>
- Okay okay.

72
00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:50.626
Thank you.
Thank you.

73
00:12:50.864 --> 00:12:52.795
<i>- You'll be there?</i>
- I'm not going anywhere.

74
00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:54.336
<i>All right, I'll send someone.</i>

75
00:13:00.305 --> 00:13:01.664
Aggh!

76
00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:19.051
So is this gonna
take much longer?

77
00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:23.062
Not much.

78
00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:24.935
What's wrong with it?

79
00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.817
Yes!

80
00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:50.663
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.

81
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.005
Sorry. You saved me from having
to bathe in the lake.

82
00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:58.155
Excuse me.
I, uh-- excuse me.

83
00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.905
Wait, I didn't--

84
00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:05.381
Ground rule double.

85
00:14:05.554 --> 00:14:08.595
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.

86
00:14:08.812 --> 00:14:11.082
Fine, maybe a triple.

87
00:14:11.547 --> 00:14:14.165
But you gotta knock its guts clean out
its mouth if you wanna score a run.

88
00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.820
Man, would you turn
that shit off?

89
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:18.107
You're gonna get us in trouble
with that human society.

90
00:14:20.228 --> 00:14:23.046
- It's humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.

91
00:14:23.245 --> 00:14:26.096
I told you, Andy,
this thing's gonna make me a fortune.

92
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:29.112
So you two retards
gonna go fishing or what?

93
00:14:30.024 --> 00:14:32.096
Hey, speaking of retards...

94
00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:34.416
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!

95
00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:41.361
Well, Stanley,
got us all here now.

96
00:14:41.908 --> 00:14:43.831
What's the big show?

97
00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:46.350
The big show

98
00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:48.256
is this.

99
00:14:49.897 --> 00:14:52.317
What did you do this time,
film yourself lighting a fart?

100
00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:56.079
I don't know why I bother
with you dipshits.

101
00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:59.941
I got Matthew's girlfriend here
in a very private moment.

102
00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:01.466
Girlfriend?

103
00:15:02.212 --> 00:15:05.688
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since
he was sucking on his mama's titties.

104
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:09.119
He had that city girl all alone
and he didn't even try to nail her.

105
00:15:10.362 --> 00:15:11.748
What city girl?

106
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.248
You know what girl.

107
00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:15.456
The one from the gas station
the other day.

108
00:15:15.609 --> 00:15:17.224
The one that had you
on your ass.

109
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.649
She had Matt here fixing
her pipes.

110
00:15:22.263 --> 00:15:25.279
She even gave him a kiss
for servicing her.

111
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.771
Bullshit.

112
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.166
No, she-- she-- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.

113
00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.591
Hey, Matthew,

114
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.696
don't you lie to me.

115
00:15:35.591 --> 00:15:38.127
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.

116
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:40.348
Oh shit.

117
00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:45.950
Andy: Hey, that's some good
camerawork, man.

118
00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.816
You dirty dog, man.

119
00:15:49.083 --> 00:15:50.641
How the fuck did you get that?

120
00:15:50.873 --> 00:15:52.613
I've been working nights.

121
00:15:52.777 --> 00:15:54.934
She sure is something
to look at.

122
00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:56.691
Yeah yeah.

123
00:15:57.088 --> 00:16:00.105
And she likes me.

124
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.497
Come on, Matthew.

125
00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:03.751
That girl wouldn't even
give Johnny the time of day.

126
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.023
What?

127
00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:07.426
Shit.

128
00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.432
I can tame that ass
if I want to.

129
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.068
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.

130
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.323
Stuck-up city bitch.

131
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.610
City bitch like that
is ungettable.

132
00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.985
Bullshit. I'll get it.

133
00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:22.262
Let me tell you something:

134
00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:24.876
I had that bitch
creaming her panties.

135
00:16:25.126 --> 00:16:27.612
Yeah, and she had you
shitting in yours.

136
00:16:30.794 --> 00:16:32.535
You don't think I can have that
anytime I want to?

137
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:33.960
Hmm?

138
00:16:42.346 --> 00:16:43.556
Let me tell you something:

139
00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:45.993
Bitch like that,

140
00:16:46.623 --> 00:16:49.042
she come out here for one reason
and one reason only.

141
00:16:50.435 --> 00:16:53.537
Titties flopping in the window
like that for everyone to see.

142
00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:55.758
Come on, you know.

143
00:16:56.073 --> 00:16:57.499
No no.

144
00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:01.676
She's not like that, Johnny.

145
00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:04.158
They're all like that.

146
00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:09.528
Big city cock-teasing whore
is all she is.

147
00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:11.070
Fuckin' A.

148
00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:15.097
Shit, Matthew.

149
00:17:15.386 --> 00:17:18.093
You wouldn't know what to do with
a piece of ass like that if you got it.

150
00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:19.987
No shit.

151
00:17:22.158 --> 00:17:23.285
But you're lucky

152
00:17:24.412 --> 00:17:25.755
'cause I'm your friend.

153
00:17:27.578 --> 00:17:28.954
I'll show you the way.

154
00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:31.878
Hello.

155
00:21:46.158 --> 00:21:47.617
Nice shot, huh?

156
00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:49.808
Evening.

157
00:21:50.053 --> 00:21:53.451
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!

158
00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:55.183
Well now.

159
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.850
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?

160
00:21:57.462 --> 00:21:59.744
Smile real pretty
for the camera, girl.

161
00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:03.266
Mm-mm-mm.

162
00:22:06.722 --> 00:22:10.001
You all better get out
of here right now.

163
00:22:10.647 --> 00:22:11.990
I called the cops.

164
00:22:12.172 --> 00:22:14.261
Oh, she called the cops.

165
00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:19.183
You called the police
or you will call the police?

166
00:22:20.095 --> 00:22:22.850
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.

167
00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.808
What phone did you
do that with?

168
00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:27.721
Matthew told us you dropped
yours in the drain.

169
00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:28.887
Bloop!

170
00:22:32.152 --> 00:22:33.790
Speaking of.
Where the hell is that boy?

171
00:22:34.629 --> 00:22:37.395
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!

172
00:22:37.584 --> 00:22:39.911
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.

173
00:22:40.822 --> 00:22:42.248
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.

174
00:22:42.414 --> 00:22:44.083
It's all right.
Come on now.

175
00:22:44.784 --> 00:22:46.897
Come on, boy.
Come here.

176
00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:52.466
Matthew here says

177
00:22:52.562 --> 00:22:54.522
that you didn't pay him
for fixing your sink.

178
00:22:54.817 --> 00:22:56.113
That's not true.

179
00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:57.704
He ran out.

180
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:00.837
I'll take care of it.

181
00:23:01.168 --> 00:23:02.521
Andy:
He's shy, huh?

182
00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:06.438
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.

183
00:23:07.311 --> 00:23:09.135
Hold up, wait a minute.

184
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.306
Let's not worry
about any of that right now.

185
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:23.210
What's a pretty little thing like you
doing out here all alone?

186
00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:25.444
I'm writing.

187
00:23:27.317 --> 00:23:28.610
I'm a writer.

188
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.764
She's a writer.

189
00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:33.201
My boyfriend will be here soon.

190
00:23:33.383 --> 00:23:35.001
He's coming up
to the cabin.

191
00:23:35.173 --> 00:23:37.974
ls that right?

192
00:23:38.505 --> 00:23:39.214
Oh!

193
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.726
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

194
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:43.623
Boys, now we better
blow on out of here.

195
00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:45.513
We don't wanna interrupt
your date night.

196
00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:49.060
Date night!

197
00:23:49.739 --> 00:23:51.380
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart:

198
00:23:51.678 --> 00:23:55.192
There ain't no man
in his right mind

199
00:23:56.094 --> 00:23:59.359
that leaves a pretty little thing
like you out here

200
00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:01.772
all alone.

201
00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:05.236
He's coming.

202
00:24:06.148 --> 00:24:07.888
Night's almost over.

203
00:24:15.015 --> 00:24:16.391
Oh wow.

204
00:24:25.325 --> 00:24:26.352
Johnny:
Come here.

205
00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:31.126
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.

206
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:35.284
Come here, pretty little thing.

207
00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:38.356
Come here,
have a drink with me.

208
00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:39.974
No.

209
00:24:40.803 --> 00:24:42.606
Oh, there you go.

210
00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:44.356
I don't want to.

211
00:24:44.731 --> 00:24:48.668
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?

212
00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:50.523
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:24:51.154 --> 00:24:52.661
Please, I just don't want to
have a drink.

214
00:24:53.988 --> 00:24:55.198
What is this shit right here?

215
00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.071
'Cause that's already
been opened.

216
00:24:58.298 --> 00:25:00.834
Well shit, boys.
You were right.

217
00:25:01.248 --> 00:25:02.640
She's too good
to have a drink with us.

218
00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:04.045
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:25:05.358 --> 00:25:06.784
What are we to you?

220
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.670
A bunch of dirt?

221
00:25:09.353 --> 00:25:10.646
I didn't say that.

222
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:12.950
Fuckin' A,
this bitch is a writer.

223
00:25:14.292 --> 00:25:16.003
"No one wants a phone call

224
00:25:16.113 --> 00:25:17.583
at 2:00 in the morning.

225
00:25:17.793 --> 00:25:19.845
When you're 15,
it's a prank call.

226
00:25:20.044 --> 00:25:22.868
When you're 21,
it's a drunk boyfriend call.

227
00:25:23.167 --> 00:25:24.808
But after 25,

228
00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:27.609
it's usually really bad news.

229
00:25:28.073 --> 00:25:30.962
That's how I found out
my father died."

230
00:25:32.504 --> 00:25:33.896
Whose daddy died?

231
00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:38.623
Can't you all
just please leave me alone?

232
00:25:38.891 --> 00:25:41.039
No!

233
00:25:43.227 --> 00:25:45.415
Just tell me what you want.

234
00:25:47.338 --> 00:25:50.180
What do you want?
I offered you my money.

235
00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:51.958
Mm-hmm.

236
00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:56.052
Whoa!

237
00:26:04.406 --> 00:26:07.289
Here. Here.

238
00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:10.618
Fine. I'll have a drink.

239
00:26:11.185 --> 00:26:12.493
Then you have to leave.

240
00:26:12.978 --> 00:26:16.592
- All right.
- All right.

241
00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:21.116
That ain't shit.

242
00:26:21.294 --> 00:26:23.785
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.

243
00:26:24.348 --> 00:26:26.205
Now see, I--

244
00:26:27.222 --> 00:26:29.453
I know you can
do better than that.

245
00:26:30.431 --> 00:26:32.685
I'm sure that when you're
out there in the city

246
00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:35.364
with all your hoity-toity
rich friends,

247
00:26:36.242 --> 00:26:37.973
I bet you can throw 'em back
with the best of 'em.

248
00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:39.034
Now can't you?

249
00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:41.785
- I took the drink--
- I said drink that shit!

250
00:26:47.735 --> 00:26:51.310
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!

251
00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:53.732
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.

252
00:26:53.871 --> 00:26:57.064
All right, shit.

253
00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:00.213
See, that's not
so bad now, is it?

254
00:27:01.756 --> 00:27:05.536
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.

255
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.082
But we're even now, right?

256
00:27:10.342 --> 00:27:12.734
Okay?
Just please leave.

257
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.756
Please leave.

258
00:27:15.933 --> 00:27:18.519
Well, that's just not
what this is about no more.

259
00:27:22.543 --> 00:27:24.187
What is it about?

260
00:27:28.631 --> 00:27:31.300
I wanna see your teeth.

261
00:27:34.316 --> 00:27:35.460
What?

262
00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:39.239
You heard me,

263
00:27:39.902 --> 00:27:41.891
pretty little show horse.

264
00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:44.017
I want

265
00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:45.575
to see

266
00:27:46.884 --> 00:27:47.995
your teeth.

267
00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:51.741
That--

268
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:55.138
I don't want to-- no.

269
00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:04.603
Now you're gonna show
them teeth.

270
00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:07.795
You have beautiful teeth.

271
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:09.359
There.

272
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.887
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.

273
00:28:21.606 --> 00:28:23.910
Let's see more.

274
00:28:25.948 --> 00:28:27.075
Put your fingers

275
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.545
on the inside of your mouth
right there.

276
00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:34.086
Now take the other two,
stick 'em on the other side.

277
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:35.595
There you go.

278
00:28:36.705 --> 00:28:37.981
Now pull.

279
00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:41.479
- Okay, please, I'm begging you.
- No!

280
00:28:41.827 --> 00:28:42.985
No.

281
00:28:48.838 --> 00:28:50.114
Again.

282
00:28:54.042 --> 00:28:55.749
Come here.
There it is.

283
00:28:55.932 --> 00:28:57.518
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!

284
00:28:57.866 --> 00:29:01.330
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.

285
00:29:01.529 --> 00:29:04.529
Shh!

286
00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:07.496
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.

287
00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:12.943
You know why I know you
ain't got no boyfriend?

288
00:29:13.761 --> 00:29:15.054
You know why?

289
00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:19.960
'Cause all them
city boys are faggots.

290
00:29:20.209 --> 00:29:21.551
Fuckin' A.

291
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.318
Since you ain't got
no boyfriend,

292
00:29:35.325 --> 00:29:37.297
well, shit, I figured that...

293
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.067
this would be
your man tonight.

294
00:29:45.691 --> 00:29:46.691
Yeah.

295
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.432
No?
Come here.

296
00:29:53.465 --> 00:29:55.110
Come on,
give him a little kiss.

297
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:58.189
Give him a little kiss,
come on.

298
00:29:59.647 --> 00:30:01.222
Give him a little kiss here.

299
00:30:01.504 --> 00:30:03.559
Give him
a little kiss here. Kiss him.

300
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.697
Oh shit, come on now.

301
00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:08.846
Come on now. I ain't talking about no
fucking peck like you gave Matthew.

302
00:30:08.998 --> 00:30:11.415
I want you to give him
a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.

303
00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:13.727
Get up on your knees.

304
00:30:17.933 --> 00:30:19.557
If I don't like
your enthusiasm,

305
00:30:19.723 --> 00:30:22.309
I may come bad.

306
00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.784
Open up. Open up.

307
00:30:30.016 --> 00:30:32.403
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

308
00:30:32.585 --> 00:30:34.110
All right, all right.

309
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.491
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.

310
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.115
Just like it's your
first time again.

311
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:41.890
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.

312
00:30:42.056 --> 00:30:43.498
All right, all right.

313
00:30:43.672 --> 00:30:46.315
Shit!

314
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:51.122
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.

315
00:30:51.582 --> 00:30:54.603
I d-don't want to.

316
00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:55.382
I don't.

317
00:30:55.551 --> 00:30:58.531
What?
What the fuck did you say?

318
00:30:59.243 --> 00:31:02.360
What the hell you mean
you d-d-don't want to?

319
00:31:02.636 --> 00:31:04.680
I don't want to, Johnny.

320
00:31:05.252 --> 00:31:07.315
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.

321
00:31:08.293 --> 00:31:09.337
Listen to me.

322
00:31:10.232 --> 00:31:11.658
Fuck that, man.

323
00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:14.194
- I ain't fucking waiting.
- Aw shit!

324
00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:16.967
She-she likes me.

325
00:31:17.182 --> 00:31:18.376
She likes you, Matthew?

326
00:31:18.873 --> 00:31:19.984
Go ahead.

327
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.464
- Please.
- Suck it, bitch.

328
00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:26.033
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.

329
00:31:26.181 --> 00:31:27.846
Go prove it to me.

330
00:31:28.851 --> 00:31:31.639
Uh-huh.

331
00:31:31.805 --> 00:31:33.761
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!

332
00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:38.687
Come on, boys!

333
00:32:12.072 --> 00:32:13.608
Whoa there.

334
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:15.663
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.

335
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:21.630
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.

336
00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:23.586
I was assaulted.

337
00:32:23.717 --> 00:32:25.460
He came into my cabin
and he had a gun.

338
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:27.630
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.

339
00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:29.280
It was in my mouth.

340
00:32:29.344 --> 00:32:31.093
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.

341
00:32:31.094 --> 00:32:32.453
I know this one.

342
00:32:32.636 --> 00:32:34.922
She rented the place
down on Mockingbird Trail.

343
00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:37.889
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.

344
00:32:38.227 --> 00:32:39.696
I'm a sheriff.

345
00:32:40.906 --> 00:32:42.165
You're safe.

346
00:32:42.563 --> 00:32:44.221
Now tell me what happened.

347
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.221
These four men--

348
00:32:47.369 --> 00:32:49.657
there were four men
and they broke into my cabin.

349
00:32:49.781 --> 00:32:52.238
And they had a gun
and they assaulted me.

350
00:32:53.018 --> 00:32:55.064
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?

351
00:32:55.342 --> 00:32:57.530
Yes, I'd seen them.

352
00:32:58.292 --> 00:33:00.260
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station

353
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.486
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.

354
00:33:02.668 --> 00:33:05.370
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.

355
00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:07.901
Sounds like them boys have
been up to no good again.

356
00:33:08.332 --> 00:33:10.586
All right, Earl,
you head on back.

357
00:33:10.984 --> 00:33:13.387
- Me and Miss--
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.

358
00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.476
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head
on over to the cabin

359
00:33:15.642 --> 00:33:16.984
and straighten things out.

360
00:33:46.189 --> 00:33:47.233
Miller!

361
00:33:48.675 --> 00:33:50.468
Miller, this is the sheriff.

362
00:33:51.161 --> 00:33:54.194
You and your boys are still here,
you come on out right now.

363
00:34:10.172 --> 00:34:14.067
Miller, if you're up there,
you'll be leaving by the window.

364
00:34:16.918 --> 00:34:18.310
Ma'am, stay here.

365
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:55.801
You here alone?

366
00:34:56.564 --> 00:34:57.675
Yes.

367
00:35:06.241 --> 00:35:07.603
With all this?

368
00:35:08.316 --> 00:35:10.222
I didn't plan on drinking it all
right away.

369
00:35:10.307 --> 00:35:12.196
I was gonna be here
for a couple months.

370
00:35:13.122 --> 00:35:14.664
You drink some this evening?

371
00:35:15.156 --> 00:35:16.222
Yes.

372
00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:38.581
One of them went upstairs
and he went through everything.

373
00:35:50.591 --> 00:35:52.073
They do this too?

374
00:35:52.437 --> 00:35:54.957
Please, I really don't care
about any of that.

375
00:35:56.466 --> 00:35:58.006
How long you been here?

376
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.559
Just a couple days.

377
00:36:02.332 --> 00:36:04.586
Anything strange happen
before this?

378
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:08.879
You have a run-in
with any of these guys?

379
00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:11.100
No, not really.

380
00:36:11.515 --> 00:36:13.719
Just stopped for gas
and directions.

381
00:36:19.205 --> 00:36:21.465
Ma'am, is this your
marijuana cigarette?

382
00:36:22.212 --> 00:36:25.090
Um, no.

383
00:36:25.494 --> 00:36:27.798
One of the boys
must have left it.

384
00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:32.501
You mean to tell me one
of them guys is wearing lipstick?

385
00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:37.245
This ain't the big city.

386
00:36:38.306 --> 00:36:39.847
Please, I may have smoked a joint,

387
00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:42.383
but that doesn't mean
that I made any of this up.

388
00:36:44.032 --> 00:36:45.698
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.

389
00:36:45.817 --> 00:36:48.814
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?

390
00:36:49.279 --> 00:36:52.245
What could you possibly
need backup for? I'm the victim.

391
00:36:52.461 --> 00:36:56.472
Ma'am, you've been drinking,
smoking marijuana cigarettes.

392
00:36:57.035 --> 00:37:00.085
You got enough booze in here to put
the whole town three sheets to the wind.

393
00:37:01.063 --> 00:37:03.367
You're running around in your sleeping
garments at the crack of dawn.

394
00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:04.948
You gotta see this
from my point of view.

395
00:37:05.154 --> 00:37:08.734
What? They came in here
and they assaulted me.

396
00:37:08.867 --> 00:37:10.186
You have to believe me.

397
00:37:10.187 --> 00:37:12.501
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to get to the bottom of this.

398
00:37:12.716 --> 00:37:14.103
You're making serious accusations

399
00:37:14.104 --> 00:37:16.329
about boys I've known
since they was kids.

400
00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:20.470
And you haven't been
altogether truthful now, have you?

401
00:37:23.229 --> 00:37:26.503
Now please,
step up against the wall.

402
00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:40.629
Shoulder width apart.

403
00:37:52.215 --> 00:37:54.055
Ma'am, please.

404
00:37:55.132 --> 00:37:56.640
Look right ahead.

405
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.265
Now...

406
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:22.082
I want the whole story.

407
00:38:23.557 --> 00:38:25.364
You tell me the whole thing.

408
00:38:28.104 --> 00:38:30.380
You start by telling me
what those boys did.

409
00:38:30.437 --> 00:38:32.800
Tell the sheriff the truth,
show horse.

410
00:38:37.939 --> 00:38:40.673
Better yet,
why don't you show him?

411
00:38:46.027 --> 00:38:48.032
Show him how that pretty little mouth
of yours couldn't get enough

412
00:38:48.148 --> 00:38:50.767
- as far as I recall.
- ls that right?

413
00:39:10.325 --> 00:39:11.635
They do this?

414
00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:14.618
Nice little tits.

415
00:39:27.463 --> 00:39:29.734
I asked you a question.

416
00:39:33.181 --> 00:39:34.839
Please.

417
00:39:37.093 --> 00:39:39.927
You show the sheriff
your teeth there, show horse.

418
00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:41.880
Come on.

419
00:39:43.292 --> 00:39:45.281
- Come on, move.
- Get!

420
00:39:46.292 --> 00:39:47.717
Move!

421
00:39:57.029 --> 00:39:58.471

422
00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:01.557
I said whinny!

423
00:40:01.707 --> 00:40:04.375
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!

424
00:40:04.955 --> 00:40:08.129
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!

425
00:40:09.944 --> 00:40:12.488
Huh.Huh.

426
00:40:16.765 --> 00:40:19.715
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.

427
00:40:20.378 --> 00:40:22.102
Keep whinnying, show horse.

428
00:40:22.277 --> 00:40:23.958
Here we go.

429
00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.428
Get on your knees.

430
00:40:29.146 --> 00:40:30.472
Keep whinnying!

431
00:40:30.819 --> 00:40:32.428
Oh-ho-ho!

432
00:40:38.428 --> 00:40:40.765
You oughta tame

433
00:40:42.687 --> 00:40:44.361
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.

434
00:40:44.572 --> 00:40:46.731
On your feet or you're not
gonna get your sugar cube.

435
00:40:47.063 --> 00:40:48.696
Matthew,
get your clothes off, boy.

436
00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:50.030
We're gonna get
your cherry popped.

437
00:40:50.196 --> 00:40:51.505
Huh-uh.

438
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.107
Matthew, I ain't
asking you a question.

439
00:40:54.903 --> 00:40:57.057
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.

440
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.068
You wanna talk the talk,
you better walk the walk.

441
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.941
I'm walking.

442
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.001
- Stop, stop.
- Virgin.

443
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.796
Please stop.

444
00:41:12.365 --> 00:41:14.735
You get your clothes off
or I'm gonna slice her

445
00:41:14.851 --> 00:41:16.284

446
00:41:18.306 --> 00:41:20.295

00:41:20.702 --> 00:41:24.090

00:41:28.214 --> 00:41:30.255
- There's Matthew.
- Now he gets it.

449
00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:31.996
Pants off, boy.

450
00:41:32.169 --> 00:41:35.842
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.

451
00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:40.523
Well, it's not totally his fault.

452
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.319
She ain't done much to get
his motor running now, has she?

453
00:41:45.595 --> 00:41:46.871
Dance.

454
00:41:49.258 --> 00:41:49.815
Dance.

This is for you, Matthew.

00:42:33.197 --> 00:42:34.789
Oh yeah!
Oh shit!

471
00:42:34.954 --> 00:42:37.585
Get her up here.
Shut her up.

472
00:42:39.674 --> 00:42:42.177
No!No!No!

473
00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:43.983
Hold her legs!

474
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:45.316
Oh my God.

475
00:42:45.574 --> 00:42:47.585
I'll bash your fucking

476
00:42:48.447 --> 00:42:51.397
- Shut up.
- No no no!

477
00:42:51.596 --> 00:42:53.585
That's for you.
Get your drawers off, Matthew.

478
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.988
- God damn it.
- Okay.

00:42:57.264 --> 00:42:59.353

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.150

00:43:06.887 --> 00:43:08.650
Yeah, get her.

482
00:43:08.651 --> 00:43:10.368
- Damn it, hold her still.
- Come on, retard.

483
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.567
- No! No!
- Hold her down!

484
00:43:13.749 --> 00:43:15.983
- Stick your pee-pee in her.

Come on, Matt, get in here.
Get in there.

00:43:25.078 --> 00:43:26.968
- Yeah, Matthew!
- Oh no!

489
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.529
Look at him go.
There's a gang-banger.

490
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.424
Feels good, don't it, Matthew,
pumping away on her? Get her legs.

491
00:43:34.788 --> 00:43:36.963
Yeah, come on, son.
Come on, boy!

492
00:43:37.192 --> 00:43:39.961
Deep. Get in deep.
Get in deep.

00:43:40.206 --> 00:43:42.945
Deep, deep, deep, deep!

494
00:43:43.144 --> 00:43:45.746
- Deep!
- Yeah, Matthew.

495
00:43:46.206 --> 00:43:48.577
Get over here.

496
00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:51.348
Hey, put that thing down
and get over here.

497
00:43:51.566 --> 00:43:55.077
- Keep her quiet. Fucking gag her.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

498
00:43:55.608 --> 00:43:56.519
Gag her!

499
00:43:56.982 --> 00:43:59.400
Shut her up!

500
00:43:59.482 --> 00:44:03.286
It feels good, don't it, Matthew?
Yeah yeah!

501
00:44:05.093 --> 00:44:06.800
Keep her quiet now!

502
00:44:08.491 --> 00:44:10.856
Hello, angel.

503
00:44:11.225 --> 00:44:12.773
Daddy's on a call.

504
00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:14.540
Daddy, it's Sunday.

505
00:44:14.796 --> 00:44:16.761
You always make breakfast
before church.

506
00:44:16.944 --> 00:44:18.753
I know, I know, sweetheart.

507
00:44:18.923 --> 00:44:21.535
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.

508
00:44:21.817 --> 00:44:23.358
Okay.
Bye, Daddy.

509
00:44:27.982 --> 00:44:30.076
Yeah, Matthew!
Yeah, Matthew!

510
00:44:30.817 --> 00:44:32.424
He fill her up yet?

511
00:44:34.536 --> 00:44:38.192
Damn it. Oh shit!

512
00:44:38.507 --> 00:44:40.231
You're the shit, Matthew.

513
00:44:41.408 --> 00:44:43.828
You're getting your ass beat
by a woman.

514
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.223
Matthew,
you better control that bitch.

515
00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:50.562
Hold her down. Yeah.

516
00:44:50.744 --> 00:44:51.457
Yeah!

517
00:45:20.356 --> 00:45:22.056
Yeah, boy.
Over there.

518
00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.389
Over there.

519
00:45:31.026 --> 00:45:32.998
Ain't that romantic?

520
00:45:34.722 --> 00:45:35.965
You clean that shit up.

521
00:45:36.164 --> 00:45:37.291
Make her do it.

522
00:45:37.523 --> 00:45:39.723
You heard him. Clean it up.

523
00:45:39.978 --> 00:45:43.078
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?

524
00:45:43.266 --> 00:45:45.713
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.

525
00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:49.806
You can thank me later.

526
00:45:49.989 --> 00:45:52.857
You calm down, boy.

527
00:45:52.997 --> 00:45:54.835
You did all right, Matthew.

528
00:47:02.411 --> 00:47:04.652
No, no.

529
00:47:05.083 --> 00:47:06.442
Please.

530
00:47:11.254 --> 00:47:12.376
No.

531
00:47:15.138 --> 00:47:17.111
No, no.

532
00:47:23.962 --> 00:47:26.870
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.

533
00:47:27.251 --> 00:47:30.102
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.

534
00:47:31.527 --> 00:47:33.102
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?

535
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:35.680
Why don't you have a drink?

536
00:47:42.118 --> 00:47:45.350
- Do it again!
- You like that? Let's have another one.

537
00:47:45.897 --> 00:47:47.853
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.

538
00:47:53.914 --> 00:47:56.221
All right, boys,

539
00:47:57.099 --> 00:47:59.155
that filly's got a few more races
to run.

540
00:48:05.092 --> 00:48:06.298
You like that, girl?

541
00:48:06.532 --> 00:48:10.210
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.

542
00:48:11.585 --> 00:48:13.624
You got some fight
left in you, Miss Hills.

543
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.580
I like things rough.

544
00:48:15.742 --> 00:48:19.657
Please. Please.

545
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.884
- Yeah.
- I'm sore.

546
00:48:24.729 --> 00:48:26.453
Please.

547
00:48:27.132 --> 00:48:28.657
I'm sore.

548
00:48:33.052 --> 00:48:34.560
Don't worry now, sweetheart.

549
00:48:37.758 --> 00:48:39.323
I'm an ass man.

550
00:49:29.282 --> 00:49:31.072
No teeth, show horse.

551
00:49:32.241 --> 00:49:33.690
No teeth.

552
00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:41.033
Whoo!

553
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:56.431
God damn, Stanley.

554
00:49:56.553 --> 00:49:59.563
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.

555
00:49:59.746 --> 00:50:01.005
That bitch was too tight.

556
00:50:01.983 --> 00:50:04.305
Don't you know you're supposed
to wait for the lady?

557
00:50:04.817 --> 00:50:06.707
Shit, man, like she cares.

558
00:50:06.972 --> 00:50:08.828
She's laying there
like a dead fish.

559
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:12.038
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.

560
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.900
Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna

561
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.849
be the pussy today, huh?

562
00:50:17.959 --> 00:50:19.716
Don't know what
you're bragging about, Andy.

563
00:50:20.906 --> 00:50:22.696
Clocked you
just over two minutes.

564
00:50:23.263 --> 00:50:24.705
It's been a while, man.

565
00:50:25.053 --> 00:50:26.131
I'm out of practice.

566
00:50:26.369 --> 00:50:28.848
It's been, I don't know,
maybe 10 years.

567
00:50:31.002 --> 00:50:31.910
Where you going?

568
00:50:32.083 --> 00:50:34.251
God damn,
she's got some fight in her.

569
00:52:05.006 --> 00:52:06.671
Come on, let's chase.

570
00:52:07.492 --> 00:52:09.332
Where does she think she's going?

571
00:52:26.101 --> 00:52:30.307
Well, it was fun
while it lasted, Miss Hills.

572
00:52:43.628 --> 00:52:45.203
Shit!

573
00:52:49.122 --> 00:52:50.209
Where is she?

574
00:52:53.747 --> 00:52:56.637
Hell, she's gotta
come up for air sometime.

575
00:52:57.068 --> 00:52:58.410
Shit.

576
00:53:10.099 --> 00:53:13.712
Gators must have
got her by now. Right, Sheriff?

577
00:53:19.182 --> 00:53:20.309
Listen up.

578
00:53:21.664 --> 00:53:24.519
Creek ends about six miles
downstream in Watson.

579
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.602
Between here and there,
we're gonna find her.

580
00:53:28.132 --> 00:53:30.303
We split up.
We check the banks,

581
00:53:30.377 --> 00:53:31.530
in the timber, under rocks.

582
00:53:31.646 --> 00:53:34.265
Hell, you see a hole big enough
for her, I want you in there.

583
00:53:34.994 --> 00:53:38.060
And do not stop till y'all
find me a dead city whore.

584
00:53:55.323 --> 00:53:56.400
Nothing.

585
00:54:00.693 --> 00:54:02.632
Not a goddamn thing.

586
00:54:17.366 --> 00:54:18.476
Now what?

587
00:54:19.719 --> 00:54:22.173
Her body will show up one way
or another.

588
00:54:24.675 --> 00:54:26.680
Every day we're
gonna check the ravine,

589
00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.680
from the bridge
straight down through here and back.

590
00:54:29.956 --> 00:54:31.871
Two shifts a day
till we find something.

591
00:54:32.315 --> 00:54:33.724
For how long?

592
00:54:35.929 --> 00:54:38.663
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?

593
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:44.786
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.

594
00:54:45.207 --> 00:54:47.778
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?

595
00:54:47.906 --> 00:54:48.905
Yes sir.

596
00:54:50.664 --> 00:54:52.353
You get her wheels
down the shop.

597
00:54:52.619 --> 00:54:54.822
Strip it down to its
last goddamn nut.

598
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.728
That's gonna take two weeks.

599
00:55:01.452 --> 00:55:03.501
All right, Sheriff, yeah.

600
00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:05.800
I'll have Andy torch it out

601
00:55:05.876 --> 00:55:07.456
and I'll rub the numbers out.

602
00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:17.358
Asshole!

603
00:55:17.787 --> 00:55:20.805
The fuck you saving that for,
you moron?

604
00:55:21.137 --> 00:55:23.275
It's fucking evidence!

605
00:55:25.497 --> 00:55:28.065
I shit you not!

606
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:46.229
I need you all on point
for this.

607
00:55:46.827 --> 00:55:49.494
And I mean goddamn
fucking point.

608
00:55:49.958 --> 00:55:51.069
We clear?

609
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:56.422
Now pony up!

610
00:55:57.301 --> 00:55:58.892
We got shit to do.

611
00:56:00.002 --> 00:56:01.792
Burn that effing tape.

612
00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:08.364
Well, that's all of it,

613
00:56:08.927 --> 00:56:11.231
right down
to her little titty sling.

614
00:56:20.741 --> 00:56:22.856
Man, this fire's
making me hungry.

615
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:25.395
Well, there's a headline.

616
00:56:26.642 --> 00:56:28.561
We gotta finish this shit.

617
00:56:29.257 --> 00:56:31.246
We gotta get that car
in the garage.

618
00:56:31.624 --> 00:56:34.047
Then you can stuff your face
till you puke.

619
00:56:38.506 --> 00:56:39.798
Where the hell's Matthew at?

620
00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:42.069
He ain't one
to stay behind.

621
00:56:42.871 --> 00:56:46.870
He was looking around the water like
some crazed dog after a bone, man.

622
00:56:48.134 --> 00:56:49.424
You keep an eye on him.

623
00:56:49.766 --> 00:56:52.155
We gotta make sure
he keeps it together, you hear me?

624
00:56:53.199 --> 00:56:55.155
Just at least until
this shit's over.

625
00:57:34.656 --> 00:57:36.098
Gone all day,
I got nervous.

626
00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:39.132
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.

627
00:57:39.297 --> 00:57:42.198
The mess they got on Highway 1
took forever.

628
00:57:42.662 --> 00:57:43.921
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?

629
00:57:44.104 --> 00:57:45.148
Daddy.

630
00:57:45.894 --> 00:57:47.130
Got anything on the stove?

631
00:57:47.568 --> 00:57:50.338
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.

632
00:57:50.846 --> 00:57:52.137
Proud of what?

633
00:57:56.396 --> 00:57:58.949
I was accepted
to the honors program, Daddy.

634
00:58:00.636 --> 00:58:02.635
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.

635
00:58:02.756 --> 00:58:04.750
I expect nothing less
from my angel.

636
00:58:05.277 --> 00:58:07.319
Mommy and I are
proud of you.

637
00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:12.092
I'm gonna shower up.

638
00:58:37.737 --> 00:58:40.449
Every time I come in here
this place gets worse.

639
00:58:40.648 --> 00:58:44.759
Yeah, and business keeps getting
better and better.

640
00:58:55.413 --> 00:58:56.723
Mockingbird Trail.

641
00:58:56.971 --> 00:58:58.148
Miss Hills.

642
00:58:59.176 --> 00:59:00.253
She left?

643
00:59:00.767 --> 00:59:02.320
She did indeed.

644
00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:05.436
I couldn't make head
nor tail of it.

645
00:59:06.149 --> 00:59:08.370
I found empty cases of booze,

646
00:59:08.602 --> 00:59:10.392
marijuana cigarettes.

647
00:59:10.696 --> 00:59:11.945
Crazy wild one.

648
00:59:12.198 --> 00:59:13.657
She'd have made
a preacher cuss.

649
00:59:13.836 --> 00:59:16.701
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?

650
00:59:17.328 --> 00:59:19.284
No refund policy.

651
00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:21.869
Christmas come early.

652
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:23.559
Enjoy it.

653
00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:28.034
Speaking of early,
next month's quail season.

654
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:29.926
I don't know about you,

655
00:59:30.371 --> 00:59:32.821
but I'm getting tired
of shooting squirrels.

656
00:59:33.997 --> 00:59:35.439
Me too.

657
01:00:08.752 --> 01:00:11.148
- Thank you.
- You have a pretty smile.

658
01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.767
Did you just come here
to see me?

659
01:00:14.484 --> 01:00:16.004
Happy hour, boys.

660
01:00:16.454 --> 01:00:19.700
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.

661
01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:27.855
I just want all this bullshit
to be over.

662
01:01:04.897 --> 01:01:05.941
No!

663
01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:42.225
<i>He's the big black guy
in the red drawstring.</i>

664
01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:44.065
<i>You're talking about the garbage man.</i>

665
01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.938
<i>Well, give the man a turkey.</i>

666
01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:52.195
- Hello.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

667
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.334
It's Earl.

668
01:01:56.281 --> 01:01:57.781
- Earl.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

669
01:01:57.961 --> 01:02:00.760
This woman leaves a message
on the machine.

670
01:02:00.901 --> 01:02:02.329
Barbara something or other.

671
01:02:02.981 --> 01:02:04.066
Yeah, so?

672
01:02:04.619 --> 01:02:06.644
She was asking
about that Miss Hills.

673
01:02:07.407 --> 01:02:09.588
Says no one's seen her
in over a month.

674
01:02:09.876 --> 01:02:12.097
Ain't that about the time
she split?

675
01:02:13.158 --> 01:02:14.103
Yeah.

676
01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:17.046
Yeah, and you know the story.

677
01:02:17.219 --> 01:02:19.672
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

678
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.755
I think you should
call her back.

679
01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:25.166
I mean, heck, Sheriff,

680
01:02:25.282 --> 01:02:27.685
you may have been
the last one to see her.

681
01:02:32.087 --> 01:02:33.205
Sheriff?

682
01:02:34.813 --> 01:02:36.122
Okay, I'll call her.

683
01:02:36.367 --> 01:02:38.476
Good.
You want the number?

684
01:02:40.348 --> 01:02:41.592
No, it's late.

685
01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.592
I'll get it from you
in the AM.

686
01:02:47.381 --> 01:02:48.796
We're still on
for tomorrow, right?

687
01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:50.658
Yeah, of course.

688
01:02:53.306 --> 01:02:54.884
Everything all right?

689
01:02:57.768 --> 01:02:59.028
Yeah, just fine.

690
01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.907
It's gone!

691
01:03:08.597 --> 01:03:09.962
Look at that.

692
01:03:10.642 --> 01:03:12.249
Looks like someone
spooked the cattle.

693
01:03:16.343 --> 01:03:18.780
It's gone!

694
01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.326
It's fucking gone!

695
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.680
Jesus, Stanley,
calm the fuck down.

696
01:03:22.895 --> 01:03:24.130
What's got your nuts
in a sling?

697
01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:27.068
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.

698
01:03:27.967 --> 01:03:29.776
Maybe you accidentally ate it.

699
01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:32.276
Fuck off, man,
this is serious!

700
01:03:36.027 --> 01:03:37.386
It had the tape in it.

701
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.485
What are you talking about?

702
01:03:40.482 --> 01:03:41.278
The tape.

703
01:03:42.176 --> 01:03:43.751
The fucking tape.

704
01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:47.840
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?

705
01:03:48.193 --> 01:03:50.265
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.

706
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.178
I replaced it
with a new one.

707
01:03:53.139 --> 01:03:56.040
The Sheriff stomped
on the one that had nothing on it.

708
01:04:00.763 --> 01:04:01.940
You kept that tape, huh?

709
01:04:03.283 --> 01:04:05.106
You kept that tape,
you stupid piece of shit?

710
01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:07.692
Come here.
You kept that tape?

711
01:04:07.867 --> 01:04:10.095
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!

712
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:12.990
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?

713
01:04:13.156 --> 01:04:15.460
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.

714
01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:17.283
Come on.

715
01:04:17.963 --> 01:04:20.034
Gotta stick together
on this one.

716
01:04:21.364 --> 01:04:23.310
You're too dumb to know
how dumb you are.

717
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.194
You know that?

718
01:05:08.228 --> 01:05:09.968
Uh-huh.

719
01:05:10.582 --> 01:05:12.040
Is that right?

720
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:16.996
Is that right?

721
01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.777
I better not find you,
you little fucker.

722
01:05:57.802 --> 01:06:00.914
All right.
All right, let's go.

723
01:06:01.941 --> 01:06:03.632
Come on out, fucker.

724
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:05.671
Come on!

725
01:06:06.798 --> 01:06:08.671
You think this shit's funny?

726
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.510
Andy?

727
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:20.041
Stanley?

728
01:06:24.483 --> 01:06:26.273
Fucking pussies.

729
01:06:28.162 --> 01:06:31.676
All right. All right.

730
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.356
That's it, God damn it.

731
01:07:03.997 --> 01:07:07.246
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!

732
01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:09.749
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!

733
01:07:09.928 --> 01:07:11.793
Come on out, fucker.

734
01:07:15.387 --> 01:07:17.081
Oh shit.

735
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.522
Come on.
Come on.

736
01:07:23.664 --> 01:07:25.478
Come on. Come on.

737
01:07:41.359 --> 01:07:43.208
Son of a bitch.

738
01:07:49.059 --> 01:07:50.137
Sweetheart.

739
01:07:54.567 --> 01:07:56.037
They're beautiful.

740
01:07:58.026 --> 01:07:59.566
I've been so busy.

741
01:07:59.816 --> 01:08:03.330
No need to explain.
You hadn't taken a single day off.

742
01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:05.037
You're only human.

743
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:05.916
I guess.

744
01:08:06.078 --> 01:08:08.750
Maybe you can help me with something
while I put these in water.

745
01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:09.927
Help with what?

746
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:12.993
I got this tape delivered,
but it don't fit our machine.

747
01:08:14.137 --> 01:08:15.280
What tape?

748
01:08:15.481 --> 01:08:18.579
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.

749
01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.160
Chastity see this?

750
01:08:26.607 --> 01:08:29.723
No. Like I said,
we couldn't get it to play.

751
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.063
Where is she?

752
01:08:32.528 --> 01:08:33.917
She's sleeping. Why?

753
01:08:37.957 --> 01:08:39.353
I'm gonna be back.

754
01:08:50.718 --> 01:08:52.130
Where the hell you been?

755
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:56.241
Beauty queen over here
doing his hair for two hours.

756
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:58.909
What's this all about, man?

757
01:09:00.434 --> 01:09:02.257
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?

758
01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.285
Right there.
That's where I got that.

759
01:09:04.478 --> 01:09:06.799
Somebody left me a present
last night on my doorstep.

760
01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:09.276
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!

761
01:09:10.105 --> 01:09:11.978
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.

762
01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:14.630
No one knows where he's at.

763
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.000
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.

764
01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:29.691
What?

765
01:09:30.882 --> 01:09:32.293
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.

766
01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:35.011
You wanna tell me why
this was dropped off to my house?

767
01:09:37.696 --> 01:09:38.906
To my wife!

768
01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.384
What's on the tape?

769
01:09:46.303 --> 01:09:47.460
ls this some kind of fucked up joke?

770
01:09:47.596 --> 01:09:49.271
I smashed the damn thing myself!

771
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:53.063
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.

772
01:09:53.563 --> 01:09:55.396
The one you smashed
ain't got nothing on it.

773
01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.450
- You knew about this?
- No, Sheriff,

774
01:09:58.519 --> 01:10:00.508
I just found out about it myself.

775
01:10:02.482 --> 01:10:04.454
Eat that tape, fat boy!

776
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.070
Fucking tape!

777
01:10:08.714 --> 01:10:10.073
You think it's funny?

778
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:14.896
You screwed up, fat boy.

779
01:10:15.758 --> 01:10:17.449
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.

780
01:10:17.793 --> 01:10:20.175
I mean, dipshit there,
he kept the tape as a souvenir,

781
01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.880
but Matthew's the one
that took it, Sheriff.

782
01:10:22.046 --> 01:10:25.450
Look at this. Silly bastard
left me a present last night.

783
01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:27.655
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.

784
01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.815
I think he even
feels guilty.

785
01:10:33.489 --> 01:10:35.527
You dipshits bring him to me.

786
01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:39.190
I'm gonna cut
his retard pecker off

787
01:10:39.339 --> 01:10:41.056
and use it as a goddamn
hood ornament.

788
01:10:41.311 --> 01:10:43.431
That's before I'm done shoving it
up your dirt hole.

789
01:10:43.632 --> 01:10:45.240
Shit, we've been looking
for him, Sheriff.

790
01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:47.568
Trust me, we've been
everywhere looking for him.

791
01:11:03.307 --> 01:11:05.232
I want him found tonight.

792
01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:08.100
Or I swear to Christ,

793
01:11:08.141 --> 01:11:10.730
I'll bring the wrath of God
down on you.

794
01:11:47.031 --> 01:11:49.350
Can you believe there used
to be a limit on quail?

795
01:11:49.731 --> 01:11:51.902
Goddamn things
are like locusts now.

796
01:11:52.969 --> 01:11:55.085
Much to our good fortune.

797
01:11:57.594 --> 01:11:59.543
I gotta take a break.

798
01:11:59.969 --> 01:12:02.560
My dogs are barking
something fierce.

799
01:12:06.469 --> 01:12:08.470
I remember when you and my old man
chased that buck

800
01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:11.153
out from the hollows
on Stickler Farm before bagging it.

801
01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.799
Aww. Them were
the good old days.

802
01:12:17.639 --> 01:12:18.953
To the good old days.

803
01:12:19.495 --> 01:12:22.396
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?

804
01:12:22.549 --> 01:12:23.788
You just enjoy it.

805
01:12:32.257 --> 01:12:34.180
This is some fine whiskey.

806
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:40.047
Usually you don't get
something like this except at baptisms

807
01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:42.300
and weddings.

808
01:12:42.382 --> 01:12:43.584
And funerals.

809
01:12:52.626 --> 01:12:54.200
Loose ends, Earl.

810
01:12:58.733 --> 01:13:00.113
Loose ends.

811
01:13:19.491 --> 01:13:21.393
<i>Matthew.</i>

812
01:13:24.024 --> 01:13:25.951
<i>I'm over here.</i>

813
01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.478
<i>Matthew!</i>

814
01:13:39.129 --> 01:13:42.241
<i>Matthew.</i>

815
01:14:11.461 --> 01:14:14.875
l-- I knew--
knew you were alive.

816
01:14:17.297 --> 01:14:18.720
I knew it.

817
01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:20.842
How did you know, Matthew?

818
01:14:21.464 --> 01:14:22.682
Huh?

819
01:14:23.345 --> 01:14:25.400
How did you know
I was alive?

820
01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:29.245
Are you sure
you're not dreaming?

821
01:14:32.247 --> 01:14:33.289
Am I?

822
01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:35.527
Am I dreaming?

823
01:14:36.322 --> 01:14:37.483
Come here.

824
01:14:38.577 --> 01:14:39.787
Sit with me.

825
01:14:50.162 --> 01:14:54.161
I need to tell you--

826
01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:56.494
Shh!

827
01:14:59.626 --> 01:15:01.251
I know, Matthew.

828
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:05.345
I know this wasn't your fault.

829
01:15:07.399 --> 01:15:08.958
You tried to help me.

830
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:10.897
I did.

831
01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:14.577
I really really did.

832
01:15:18.455 --> 01:15:19.856
And-- and--

833
01:15:19.927 --> 01:15:21.803
and you're okay.

834
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.783
You're-- you're okay.

835
01:15:27.507 --> 01:15:30.341
Yes, Matthew.

836
01:15:33.623 --> 01:15:34.832
Now come.

837
01:15:40.041 --> 01:15:41.139
Come on.

838
01:15:42.199 --> 01:15:43.658
It's okay.

839
01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.393
It's okay.

840
01:15:48.183 --> 01:15:51.332
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Come on.

841
01:15:52.128 --> 01:15:56.874
I'm so sorry.

842
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:05.508
Oh God!

843
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:14.873
I'm so sorry.

844
01:16:15.287 --> 01:16:16.547
Matthew.

845
01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:22.364
- Matthew.
- Yeah.

846
01:16:23.104 --> 01:16:25.348
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.

847
01:16:29.699 --> 01:16:31.073
Tell me again
how sorry you are.

848
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.973
l'm-- l'm-- I'm sorry.

849
01:16:58.025 --> 01:17:00.581
It's just not good enough!

850
01:17:10.103 --> 01:17:11.744
Matthew!

851
01:17:17.014 --> 01:17:18.473
Matthew!

852
01:17:21.589 --> 01:17:23.412
Matthew!

853
01:17:26.395 --> 01:17:28.070
Matthew!

854
01:17:44.876 --> 01:17:46.335
Matthew!

855
01:17:52.721 --> 01:17:54.594
Come on out, Matthew.

856
01:17:59.201 --> 01:18:00.726
Matthew!

857
01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:19.288
Matthew?

858
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:31.139
You're only making it harder
on yourself, Matt.

859
01:18:41.071 --> 01:18:43.445
Boo!

860
01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.093
Stupid fuck,
what the hell's wrong with you?

861
01:18:46.314 --> 01:18:47.739
Whoo!

862
01:18:54.792 --> 01:18:56.880
Fucker's playing your song.

863
01:19:02.527 --> 01:19:04.526
Your ass is grass, Matthew.

864
01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:06.976
Matthew, you're a dead man.

865
01:19:07.705 --> 01:19:09.130
Whoo!

866
01:19:13.987 --> 01:19:16.523
- Come on, man.
- I'm gonna kill him.

867
01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:18.876
Don't you pass out on me.

868
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:21.628
I'm too tired to drag
your ass back.

869
01:19:29.955 --> 01:19:31.215
What the hell?

870
01:19:33.585 --> 01:19:35.193
Matthew?

871
01:19:38.508 --> 01:19:39.751
Matthew!

872
01:19:40.924 --> 01:19:43.513
God damn it, Matthew,
where are you?

873
01:19:44.703 --> 01:19:46.808
Where are you,
you little fucker?

874
01:19:54.279 --> 01:19:56.806
Andy, he ain't out here.

875
01:20:03.861 --> 01:20:05.801
You little bitch.

876
01:20:14.966 --> 01:20:18.049
Andy! Andy!

877
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:21.483
Andy, help me!

878
01:20:24.417 --> 01:20:25.600
- What the fuck, man?
- My leg!

879
01:20:25.676 --> 01:20:26.357
Ahem.

880
01:20:28.459 --> 01:20:29.755
Andy!

881
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:18.186
Stanley!

882
01:21:22.014 --> 01:21:23.987
Stanley, help me!

883
01:21:25.711 --> 01:21:27.335
Matthew?

884
01:21:28.827 --> 01:21:31.561
Help me!
Please!

885
01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:36.581
Somebody!

886
01:21:37.923 --> 01:21:39.385
Stanley!

887
01:21:42.567 --> 01:21:44.324
Come on, Stanley.

888
01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.622
Matthew, this shit
ain't funny, boy.

889
01:21:52.429 --> 01:21:54.119
Somebody help me!

890
01:21:55.048 --> 01:21:57.037
Jennifer: Smile real pretty
for the camera, boy.

891
01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.937
Please!

892
01:22:03.766 --> 01:22:05.790
I know you like to watch,
don't you?

893
01:22:06.534 --> 01:22:08.275
Don't you, you sick fuck?

894
01:22:09.386 --> 01:22:12.734
Don't worry,
I'll give you quite a show.

895
01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.137
Matthew!

896
01:22:18.104 --> 01:22:19.728
<i>Matthew!</i>

897
01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:25.513
<i>- Stanley!</i>
- Here you go.

898
01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:27.790
You remember this?

899
01:22:28.148 --> 01:22:30.386
<i>- Stanley, help me!</i>

900
01:22:40.179 --> 01:22:42.118
Somebody help me!

901
01:22:43.842 --> 01:22:45.334
<i>Help!</i>

902
01:22:47.008 --> 01:22:48.218
Can't talk, can you?

903
01:22:49.792 --> 01:22:51.765
Maybe it's because
you're hungry.

904
01:22:57.499 --> 01:23:01.046
You know, you gotta eat a lot
of nasty shit out here to stay alive.

905
01:23:05.853 --> 01:23:08.273
Are you hungry?
You hungry?

906
01:23:12.247 --> 01:23:14.120
What's wrong?
You don't like it?

907
01:23:30.035 --> 01:23:31.675
What are you doing?

908
01:23:33.316 --> 01:23:34.559
Some fishing.

909
01:23:36.863 --> 01:23:38.637
I know how you guys
like to fish.

910
01:24:11.699 --> 01:24:12.942
Don't blink.

911
01:24:14.944 --> 01:24:16.403
You okay, Stan?

912
01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:47.191
How's it going?

913
01:25:06.038 --> 01:25:07.480
I'm sorry.

914
01:25:13.696 --> 01:25:14.785
Please!

915
01:25:15.446 --> 01:25:17.525
Please is what I said to you.

916
01:25:19.613 --> 01:25:20.624
You said...

917
01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:23.989
"Suck it, bitch."

918
01:25:28.547 --> 01:25:29.856
Does that ring any bells?

919
01:25:30.456 --> 01:25:31.497
Suck...

920
01:25:32.392 --> 01:25:33.436
it...

921
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.088
bitch!

922
01:25:44.652 --> 01:25:46.077
Be right back.

923
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:51.215
Wait, come back.
Come back here.

924
01:25:52.044 --> 01:25:53.536
<i>Come back here.</i>

925
01:25:56.917 --> 01:25:58.558
<i>Stanley!</i>

926
01:26:01.309 --> 01:26:04.028
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you bitch.</i>

927
01:26:06.806 --> 01:26:08.033
Hi.

928
01:26:10.454 --> 01:26:11.953
You like the show so far?

929
01:26:11.954 --> 01:26:13.578
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

930
01:26:14.646 --> 01:26:15.690
Wait.

931
01:26:16.585 --> 01:26:17.828
It gets better.

932
01:26:18.326 --> 01:26:21.943
Please, my eyes.

933
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:24.446
I can't take it anymore.

934
01:26:26.502 --> 01:26:27.861
Oh, let me help you.

935
01:26:39.454 --> 01:26:40.843
<i>Let me out!</i>

936
01:26:43.727 --> 01:26:44.988
<i>Stanley!</i>

937
01:26:45.401 --> 01:26:46.428
Please.

938
01:26:49.627 --> 01:26:50.705
Please.

939
01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:55.180
Please. Please.

940
01:27:02.198 --> 01:27:03.557
That might feel better.

941
01:27:08.281 --> 01:27:09.640
<i>Help!</i>

942
01:27:16.319 --> 01:27:18.938
Huh-uh-uh,
now don't drown too soon.

943
01:27:31.286 --> 01:27:32.264
Fuck you.

944
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:34.999
Now is that any way
to talk to a lady?

945
01:27:51.587 --> 01:27:52.644
I'm impressed.

946
01:27:53.357 --> 01:27:54.883
You got a lot of fight in you.

947
01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.784
Let's see how you do now.

948
01:27:59.292 --> 01:28:02.126
What's that?

949
01:28:02.805 --> 01:28:05.089
It's just some lye
I found laying around.

950
01:28:08.673 --> 01:28:09.817
No!

951
01:28:13.993 --> 01:28:17.225
Let's see how long you can keep
that pretty little face of yours.

952
01:28:18.618 --> 01:28:20.093
Fuck you!

953
01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:23.971
You already did that.

954
01:28:24.353 --> 01:28:26.242
I didn't enjoy it much.

955
01:28:26.561 --> 01:28:30.087
Now it's my turn
to fuck you.

956
01:28:31.446 --> 01:28:33.319
- Please. Please.
- Oh.

957
01:28:34.844 --> 01:28:35.988
Please.

958
01:30:11.253 --> 01:30:12.960
Pain in the ass.

959
01:30:21.575 --> 01:30:22.619
Good morning.

960
01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:24.907
Whoo.

961
01:30:25.389 --> 01:30:27.687
Hey there.
Can I fill you up?

962
01:31:02.764 --> 01:31:04.488
It's date night.

963
01:31:18.064 --> 01:31:20.136
Your mouth doesn't look
so good.

964
01:31:21.031 --> 01:31:23.318
Maybe you should show me
your teeth.

965
01:31:38.265 --> 01:31:39.674
I'll kill you.

966
01:31:40.602 --> 01:31:41.911
I'll kill you.

967
01:31:47.795 --> 01:31:49.403
Ornery stallion.

968
01:31:51.309 --> 01:31:53.464
Guess I'm gonna
have to tame you.

969
01:32:08.821 --> 01:32:12.263
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.

970
01:32:12.783 --> 01:32:14.722
I'm gonna have to
take care of that.

971
01:32:24.103 --> 01:32:25.594
Huh? Huh?

972
01:32:25.764 --> 01:32:29.241
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!

973
01:32:34.306 --> 01:32:36.510
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races

974
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:38.174
left to run, show horse.

975
01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.813
That is disgusting.

976
01:33:06.449 --> 01:33:09.101
Even your boys
didn't piss themselves.

977
01:33:15.153 --> 01:33:16.493
Look who's here.

978
01:33:18.962 --> 01:33:20.719
It's my boyfriend.

979
01:33:22.675 --> 01:33:24.266
Remember him?

980
01:33:25.874 --> 01:33:27.913
Why don't you give him
a little kiss?

981
01:33:29.288 --> 01:33:31.427
Hmm? Hmm?

982
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:33.900
Let's go, come on.

983
01:33:34.113 --> 01:33:37.063
I don't take orders
from no fucking woman.

984
01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.721
No?

985
01:33:43.809 --> 01:33:45.384
Breathe through your nose.

986
01:33:45.616 --> 01:33:47.787
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.

987
01:33:48.085 --> 01:33:50.273
Just like it was
your first time, remember?

988
01:33:58.731 --> 01:34:00.388
Fuck you!

989
01:34:01.548 --> 01:34:03.239
Fuck you!

990
01:34:04.615 --> 01:34:06.604
Fuck you!

991
01:34:16.797 --> 01:34:18.025
Let me tell you something:

992
01:34:19.101 --> 01:34:20.195
You know,

993
01:34:22.134 --> 01:34:23.900
you weren't even
a good blowjob.

994
01:34:29.922 --> 01:34:31.644
No.

995
01:34:33.388 --> 01:34:36.488
You know what they do to horses
that can't be tamed, Johnny?

996
01:34:41.567 --> 01:34:43.058
You geld them.

997
01:34:49.075 --> 01:34:50.255
No teeth, show horse.

998
01:34:50.964 --> 01:34:52.307
No teeth.

999
01:35:00.716 --> 01:35:01.843
Bitch!

1000
01:35:55.434 --> 01:35:56.825
Hey, sweetheart.

1001
01:35:57.125 --> 01:36:00.755
- Chastity's new teacher's here.
- Storch: <i>Mrs. Novick?</i>

1002
01:36:01.416 --> 01:36:04.380
No, from the honors program.

1003
01:36:04.930 --> 01:36:08.046
<i>- Do you remember anything?</i>
- Oh yeah, that's right.

1004
01:36:09.587 --> 01:36:11.755
<i>- I'm real busy, sweetheart.</i>
- Hey, Daddy.

1005
01:36:13.549 --> 01:36:14.825
Hello, angel.

1006
01:36:15.123 --> 01:36:16.700
Daddy's real busy working.

1007
01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.901
But I really want you
to meet my new teacher.

1008
01:36:20.406 --> 01:36:21.831
She's way cool.

1009
01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:26.409
Here. Just say hi.

1010
01:36:29.509 --> 01:36:30.702
Howdy, Sheriff.

1011
01:36:32.203 --> 01:36:34.747
It's truly an honor
to speak with you, Miss...

1012
01:36:35.045 --> 01:36:37.010
Hills, Jennifer Hills.

1013
01:36:42.453 --> 01:36:43.723
Excuse me?

1014
01:36:43.887 --> 01:36:46.689
I have to tell you it's been
a pleasure meeting your family.

1015
01:36:47.982 --> 01:36:49.261
You have a wonderful daughter

1016
01:36:49.418 --> 01:36:51.741
with a bright
and promising future.

1017
01:36:53.979 --> 01:36:56.325
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1018
01:36:56.531 --> 01:36:58.116
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

1019
01:36:58.355 --> 01:36:59.465
No, wait!

1020
01:37:07.139 --> 01:37:08.150
Shit!

1021
01:37:30.634 --> 01:37:31.910
Chastity, where is she?

1022
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:33.390
She went to Hanson Park
with Miss Hills.

1023
01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:36.250
She wanted to get to know her students
in the program before the year st--

1024
01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:37.727
God damn it!

1025
01:37:38.197 --> 01:37:39.397
Who is she?

1026
01:37:42.369 --> 01:37:43.811
Who is this woman?

1027
01:38:07.255 --> 01:38:08.783
Chastity!

1028
01:38:15.303 --> 01:38:16.828
Chastity!

1029
01:38:19.453 --> 01:38:20.945
Where are you, angel?

1030
01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:31.383
Chastity!

1031
01:39:12.944 --> 01:39:16.013
Oh, no! No!

1032
01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:18.033
Please!

1033
01:39:20.917 --> 01:39:25.431
No.

1034
01:39:29.867 --> 01:39:31.430
Help me, Jesus.

1035
01:39:32.187 --> 01:39:33.763
Does that hurt, Sheriff?

1036
01:39:36.771 --> 01:39:38.992
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.

1037
01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:42.357
Where is she, you bitch?

1038
01:39:45.904 --> 01:39:48.871
I'd be real careful
how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.

1039
01:39:50.478 --> 01:39:52.119
What have you done to her?

1040
01:39:55.706 --> 01:39:58.026
By her, I assume
you mean your daughter?

1041
01:39:59.661 --> 01:40:02.097
She really is lovely, Sheriff.

1042
01:40:05.694 --> 01:40:06.904
So young.

1043
01:40:08.395 --> 01:40:09.705
So sweet.

1044
01:40:11.926 --> 01:40:14.163
So innocent.

1045
01:40:18.291 --> 01:40:20.114
I mean, can you imagine?

1046
01:40:21.572 --> 01:40:22.981
Imagine what?

1047
01:40:28.401 --> 01:40:31.583
Imagine that somebody
had done something

1048
01:40:31.749 --> 01:40:34.103
like this... to her.

1049
01:40:37.339 --> 01:40:39.461
Someone like Andy.

1050
01:40:39.825 --> 01:40:42.411
Or Stanley or Johnny.

1051
01:40:43.223 --> 01:40:44.420
Or more likely you,

1052
01:40:44.521 --> 01:40:47.151
you sick, perverted rapist!

1053
01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:54.991
- Deep, deep, deep!
- Fuck!

1054
01:40:55.179 --> 01:40:57.347
Deep! Deep!

1055
01:40:57.517 --> 01:40:59.308
Deep! Deep! Deep!

1056
01:40:59.896 --> 01:41:02.217
Jesus fucking Jesus.

1057
01:41:08.416 --> 01:41:13.831
Please.

1058
01:41:15.775 --> 01:41:18.957
Ma'am.
Ma'am.

1059
01:41:27.974 --> 01:41:30.178
She's just an innocent girl.

1060
01:41:39.858 --> 01:41:40.968
So was I.

1061
01:41:48.659 --> 01:41:51.626
What are you doing? What?

1062
01:41:56.217 --> 01:41:57.394
Matthew.

1063
01:42:09.084 --> 01:42:11.123
You won't get
a-fucking-way with this.

1064
01:42:13.825 --> 01:42:15.631
You won't get away with this!

1065
01:42:18.515 --> 01:42:20.322
He'll be waking up soon.

1066
01:42:21.797 --> 01:42:23.830
If I were you,
I'd tell him not to move.

1067
01:42:25.029 --> 01:42:27.018
Please, I'm begging you.

1068
01:42:28.294 --> 01:42:30.532
I'm a God-fearing person.

1069
01:42:30.814 --> 01:42:31.758
I got--

1070
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:34.593
I've got a baby coming, please.

1071
01:42:35.753 --> 01:42:38.687
Please, I'm begging you.
We can figure something out.

1072
01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:40.394
Sorry, Sheriff.

1073
01:42:41.852 --> 01:42:43.675
It was fun while it lasted.

1074
01:42:48.542 --> 01:42:51.936
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please.

1075
01:42:52.818 --> 01:42:54.603
I'm begging you to help me.

1076
01:42:55.238 --> 01:42:56.770
Please help me.

1077
01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:59.476
I've got a wife and family.

1078
01:43:00.388 --> 01:43:02.178
Ma'am, please!

1079
01:43:04.183 --> 01:43:06.635
You fuck!
You fuck!

1080
01:43:08.458 --> 01:43:09.561
You fuck!

1081
01:43:10.066 --> 01:43:11.740
Where are you going, you fuck?

1082
01:43:12.807 --> 01:43:14.074
<i>I'll see you in hell!</i>

1083
01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:16.066
<i>I'll rape you in hell!</i>

1084
01:43:17.077 --> 01:43:18.672
<i>You're just a piece of meat.</i>

1085
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:21.022
<i>I'll find you.</i>

1086
01:43:21.237 --> 01:43:23.541
<i>I'll hunt you down in hell,
you bitch!</i>

1087
01:43:26.475 --> 01:43:28.563
- Matthew.
- Sheriff?

1088
01:43:29.408 --> 01:43:31.040
- Matthew, no.
- Sheriff.

1089
01:43:31.132 --> 01:43:35.361
Matthew!
