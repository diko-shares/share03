00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:11.727
(hammering)

3
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.193
Hello.

4
00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:19.643
- Hello.
- Man: I'm coming!

5
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.287
I'm coming.

6
00:01:24.607 --> 00:01:25.569
Hi.

7
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.562
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.

8
00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:31.794
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.

9
00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.726
Mockingbird Trail, right?

10
00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:35.142
That is right.

11
00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:40.893
I don't suppose you know how
to get out there.

12
00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:42.899
No, I don't.

13
00:01:47.258 --> 00:01:48.651
Well, listen up.

14
00:01:50.358 --> 00:01:51.767
It's a bit tricky.

15
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.888
- Keys.
- Thank you.

16
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.827
These arrows
will get you through town.

17
00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:00.651
Over here

18
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.728
there are more
dirt roads and woods.

19
00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.936
Your cabin's a real beaut.

20
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.894
But heck, there ain't another
for a good country mile.

21
00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.414
I am looking forward
to the peace and quiet.

22
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.281
I'm actually a novelist
and I'm starting my next book here.

23
00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:15.231
If that's what you're aiming for.

24
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.944
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.

25
00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:59.452
(Service bell rings)

26
00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:03.356
(impact wrench rattling)

27
00:03:03.544 --> 00:03:08.544
(train whistle blowing)

28
00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:17.990
(playing harmonica)

29
00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.873
Howdy, ma'am.

30
00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:32.840
- (Clears throat)
- (gasps)

31
00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:34.481
Excuse me.

32
00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:36.487
I didn't mean to frighten you.

33
00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:38.525
No, that is okay.

34
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.343
You know what?
I am actually lost.

35
00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:43.315
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.

36
00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:45.636
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.

37
00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:47.360
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.

38
00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:48.885
It's about 10 miles back.

39
00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.371
It's gonna be
on your left-hand side.

40
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.106
Gonna make a left
after a big red mailbox.

41
00:03:54.387 --> 00:03:56.608
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.

42
00:03:57.122 --> 00:03:59.994
You staying over in that cabin
on Mockingbird?

43
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.039
- Yeah.
- Man: Fancy!

44
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:06.470
(Laughs)

45
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.503
So you know you're running
a little hot.

46
00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:14.545
Maybe I should check up
under your hood for you.

47
00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:18.545
(Laughing)

48
00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:20.998
How's that line
working for you?

49
00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:24.164
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?

50
00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:26.319
(dings)

51
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:34.333
- I got that.
- No, I got it.

52
00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:36.030
- No, I got it.
- (car alarm blaring)

53
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:37.363
Oh shit.

54
00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:39.863
(Laughing)

55
00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:41.957
I'm sorry, my bad.

56
00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:44.410
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.464
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

58
00:04:46.563 --> 00:04:48.851
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.

59
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.481
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.

60
00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.635
- Okay.
- All right?

61
00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:57.105
Keep the change.

62
00:04:59.306 --> 00:05:04.306
(Engine starts)

63
00:05:08.884 --> 00:05:10.906
Man:
Got you that time, Johnny.

64
00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.862
Bye-bye.

65
00:06:05.884 --> 00:06:11.639
(Birds chirping)

66
00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:38.227
(rustling)

67
00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:54.883
(birds squawking)

68
00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:00.500
Woman:
<i>How's the writing coming?</i>

69
00:08:00.572 --> 00:08:01.911
You kidding me?

70
00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:04.351
I should have come out here
on my first book.

71
00:08:04.572 --> 00:08:05.860
<i>You gonna come back
for Hertz's party?</i>

72
00:08:05.942 --> 00:08:09.680
- (Door thuds)
<i>- Jen? Did I lose you?</i>

73
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:11.677
Oh, sorry.
Something just--

74
00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:15.224
- Hey.
- (door thuds)

75
00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.889
<i>- You still there?</i>
- Barb, hold on a second.

76
00:08:28.827 --> 00:08:30.059
(loud thud)

77
00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:32.114
<i>- Jen, what's going on?</i>
- Let me call you back.

78
00:08:32.904 --> 00:08:33.904
(Cell phone beeps)

79
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.865
(door thuds)

80
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:24.539
(sighs)

81
00:09:33.404 --> 00:09:34.965
(gasps)

82
00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:38.412
You've got to be kidding me.

83
00:09:42.258 --> 00:09:44.247
Way to go, Jennifer.

84
00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:34.904
(Breathing heavily)

85
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:47.112
(wood creaking)

86
00:11:02.737 --> 00:11:07.737
( house creaking )

87
00:11:32.194 --> 00:11:36.821
( flies buzzing )

88
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.026
- ( Pipes groan )
- Ugh.

89
00:12:22.678 --> 00:12:23.689
Ew!

90
00:12:24.064 --> 00:12:26.407
( Water gurgles )

91
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:35.109
( huffs )

92
00:12:36.484 --> 00:12:37.827
Jennifer:
No, it won't flush.

93
00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:39.855
Man: Did you check the seal
on the flapper?

94
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.553
I did that already.

95
00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:43.528
<i>- You did?</i>
- Yes.

96
00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:46.959
Look, I'm really in a spot here.

97
00:12:47.341 --> 00:12:49.043
<i>- All right, I'll send somebody.</i>
- Okay okay.

98
00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:50.626
Thank you.
Thank you.

99
00:12:50.864 --> 00:12:52.795
<i>- You'll be there?</i>
- I'm not going anywhere.

100
00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:54.336
Man:
<i>All right, I'll send someone.</i>

101
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:55.631
( Phone beeps )

102
00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:57.438
( gasps )

103
00:13:00.305 --> 00:13:01.664
Aggh!

104
00:13:02.725 --> 00:13:07.546
(whirring)

105
00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:16.349
(grunts)

106
00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:19.051
So is this gonna
take much longer?

107
00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:23.062
Not much.

108
00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:24.935
What's wrong with it?

109
00:13:29.403 --> 00:13:33.232
(water running )

110
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:42.292
( toilet flushes )

111
00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.817
Yes!

112
00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:50.663
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.005
Sorry. You saved me from having
to bathe in the lake.

114
00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:58.155
Excuse me.
I, uh-- excuse me.

115
00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.905
Wait, I didn't--

116
00:14:00.143 --> 00:14:01.363
(grunts)

117
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.821
( laughing )

118
00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:05.381
Ground rule double.

119
00:14:05.554 --> 00:14:08.595
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.

120
00:14:08.812 --> 00:14:11.082
Fine, maybe a triple.

121
00:14:11.547 --> 00:14:14.165
But you gotta knock its guts clean out
its mouth if you wanna score a run.

122
00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.820
Man, would you turn
that shit off?

123
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:18.107
You're gonna get us in trouble
with that human society.

124
00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:19.963
( Laughs )

125
00:14:20.228 --> 00:14:23.046
- It's humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.

126
00:14:23.245 --> 00:14:26.096
I told you, Andy,
this thing's gonna make me a fortune.

127
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:29.112
So you two retards
gonna go fishing or what?

128
00:14:30.024 --> 00:14:32.096
Hey, speaking of retards...

129
00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:34.416
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!

130
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.819
( Laughs )

131
00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:41.361
Well, Stanley,
got us all here now.

132
00:14:41.908 --> 00:14:43.831
What's the big show?

133
00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:46.350
The big show

134
00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:48.256
is this.

135
00:14:49.897 --> 00:14:52.317
What did you do this time,
film yourself lighting a fart?

136
00:14:52.406 --> 00:14:53.742
( Laughing )

137
00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:56.079
I don't know why I bother
with you dipshits.

138
00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:59.941
I got Matthew's girlfriend here
in a very private moment.

139
00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:01.466
Andy:
Girlfriend?

140
00:15:02.212 --> 00:15:05.688
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since
he was sucking on his mama's titties.

141
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:09.119
He had that city girl all alone
and he didn't even try to nail her.

142
00:15:10.362 --> 00:15:11.748
What city girl?

143
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.248
You know what girl.

144
00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:15.456
The one from the gas station
the other day.

145
00:15:15.609 --> 00:15:17.224
The one that had you
on your ass.

146
00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:19.561
( Laughing )

147
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.649
She had Matt here fixing
her pipes.

148
00:15:22.263 --> 00:15:25.279
She even gave him a kiss
for servicing her.

149
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.771
Bullshit.

150
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.166
No, she-- she-- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.

151
00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.591
Hey, Matthew,

152
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.696
don't you lie to me.

153
00:15:35.591 --> 00:15:38.127
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.

154
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:40.348
Oh shit.

155
00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:45.950
Andy: Hey, that's some good
camerawork, man.

156
00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.816
You dirty dog, man.

157
00:15:49.083 --> 00:15:50.641
How the fuck did you get that?

158
00:15:50.873 --> 00:15:52.613
I've been working nights.

159
00:15:52.777 --> 00:15:54.934
She sure is something
to look at.

160
00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:56.691
Yeah yeah.

161
00:15:57.088 --> 00:16:00.105
And she likes me.

162
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.497
Come on, Matthew.

163
00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:03.751
That girl wouldn't even
give Johnny the time of day.

164
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.023
What?

165
00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:07.426
Shit.

166
00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.432
I can tame that ass
if I want to.

167
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.068
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.

168
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.323
Stuck-up city bitch.

169
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.610
City bitch like that
is ungettable.

170
00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.985
Bullshit. I'll get it.

171
00:16:19.086 --> 00:16:20.543
( Laughing )

172
00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:22.262
Let me tell you something:

173
00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:24.876
I had that bitch
creaming her panties.

174
00:16:25.126 --> 00:16:27.612
Yeah, and she had you
shitting in yours.

175
00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:30.629
( Laughing )

176
00:16:30.794 --> 00:16:32.535
You don't think I can have that
anytime I want to?

177
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:33.960
Hmm?

178
00:16:42.346 --> 00:16:43.556
Let me tell you something:

179
00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:45.993
Bitch like that,

180
00:16:46.623 --> 00:16:49.042
she come out here for one reason
and one reason only.

181
00:16:50.435 --> 00:16:53.537
Titties flopping in the window
like that for everyone to see.

182
00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:55.758
Come on, you know.

183
00:16:56.073 --> 00:16:57.499
No no.

184
00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:01.676
She's not like that, Johnny.

185
00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:04.158
They're all like that.

186
00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:09.528
Big city cock-teasing whore
is all she is.

187
00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:11.070
Fuckin' A.

188
00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:15.097
Shit, Matthew.

189
00:17:15.386 --> 00:17:18.093
You wouldn't know what to do with
a piece of ass like that if you got it.

190
00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:19.987
No shit.

191
00:17:22.158 --> 00:17:23.285
But you're lucky

192
00:17:24.412 --> 00:17:25.755
'cause I'm your friend.

193
00:17:27.578 --> 00:17:28.954
I'll show you the way.

194
00:17:33.346 --> 00:17:34.821
( Andy laughs )

195
00:17:45.324 --> 00:17:50.032
(pops lips)

196
00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:01.319
( sighs )

197
00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:28.939
( wood creaking )

198
00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:40.777
( moans )

199
00:19:04.694 --> 00:19:06.335
( sighs )

200
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:09.799
(thumping)

201
00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:31.878
Hello.

202
00:19:58.786 --> 00:20:00.444
-( Loud bang )
- ( screams )

203
00:20:35.921 --> 00:20:40.642
( door thumping )

204
00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:41.850
( gasps )

205
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.749
-( bangs )
- ( shrieks )

206
00:21:46.158 --> 00:21:47.617
Nice shot, huh?

207
00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:49.808
Evening.

208
00:21:50.053 --> 00:21:53.451
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!

209
00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:55.183
- Well now.
- ( camcorder beeps )

210
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.850
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?

211
00:21:57.462 --> 00:21:59.744
Smile real pretty
for the camera, girl.

212
00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:03.266
Mm-mm-mm.

213
00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:06.350
( Men laughing )

214
00:22:06.722 --> 00:22:10.001
You all better get out
of here right now.

215
00:22:10.647 --> 00:22:11.990
I called the cops.

216
00:22:12.172 --> 00:22:14.261
Oh, she called the cops.

217
00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:19.183
You called the police
or you will call the police?

218
00:22:20.095 --> 00:22:22.850
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.

219
00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.808
What phone did you
do that with?

220
00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:27.721
Matthew told us you dropped
yours in the drain.

221
00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:28.887
Bloop!

222
00:22:32.152 --> 00:22:33.790
Speaking of.
Where the hell is that boy?

223
00:22:34.629 --> 00:22:37.395
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!

224
00:22:37.584 --> 00:22:39.911
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.

225
00:22:40.822 --> 00:22:42.248
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.

226
00:22:42.414 --> 00:22:44.083
It's all right.
Come on now.

227
00:22:44.784 --> 00:22:46.897
Come on, boy.
Come here.

228
00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:52.466
Matthew here says

229
00:22:52.562 --> 00:22:54.522
that you didn't pay him
for fixing your sink.

230
00:22:54.817 --> 00:22:56.113
That's not true.

231
00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:57.704
He ran out.

232
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:00.837
I'll take care of it.

233
00:23:01.168 --> 00:23:02.521
Andy:
He's shy, huh?

234
00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:06.438
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.

235
00:23:07.311 --> 00:23:09.135
Hold up, wait a minute.

236
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.306
Let's not worry
about any of that right now.

237
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:23.210
What's a pretty little thing like you
doing out here all alone?

238
00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:25.444
I'm writing.

239
00:23:27.317 --> 00:23:28.610
I'm a writer.

240
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.764
She's a writer.

241
00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:33.201
My boyfriend will be here soon.

242
00:23:33.383 --> 00:23:35.001
He's coming up
to the cabin.

243
00:23:35.173 --> 00:23:37.974
( Laughs )
ls that right?

244
00:23:38.505 --> 00:23:39.214
Oh!

245
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.726
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

246
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:43.623
Boys, now we better
blow on out of here.

247
00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:45.513
We don't wanna interrupt
your date night.

248
00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:49.060
-( Iaughing )
- Date night!

249
00:23:49.739 --> 00:23:51.380
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart:

250
00:23:51.678 --> 00:23:55.192
There ain't no man
in his right mind

251
00:23:56.094 --> 00:23:59.359
that leaves a pretty little thing
like you out here

252
00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:01.772
all alone.

253
00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:05.236
He's coming.

254
00:24:06.148 --> 00:24:07.888
Night's almost over.

255
00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:11.800
- ( Whimpers)
- ( men laugh )

256
00:24:12.032 --> 00:24:14.750
( sniffs )

257
00:24:15.015 --> 00:24:16.391
Oh wow.

258
00:24:19.822 --> 00:24:23.153
-( Iaughing )
- ( Johnny coughs )

259
00:24:25.325 --> 00:24:26.352
Johnny:
Come here.

260
00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:31.126
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.

261
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:35.284
Come here, pretty little thing.

262
00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:38.356
Come here,
have a drink with me.

263
00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:39.974
No.

264
00:24:40.803 --> 00:24:42.606
-( Iaughing )
- Oh, there you go.

265
00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:44.356
I don't want to.

266
00:24:44.731 --> 00:24:48.668
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?

267
00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:50.523
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:24:51.154 --> 00:24:52.661
Please, I just don't want to
have a drink.

269
00:24:53.988 --> 00:24:55.198
What is this shit right here?

270
00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.071
'Cause that's already
been opened.

271
00:24:58.298 --> 00:25:00.834
Well shit, boys.
You were right.

272
00:25:01.248 --> 00:25:02.640
She's too good
to have a drink with us.

273
00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:04.045
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:25:05.358 --> 00:25:06.784
What are we to you?

275
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.670
A bunch of dirt?

276
00:25:09.353 --> 00:25:10.646
I didn't say that.

277
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:12.950
Fuckin' A,
this bitch is a writer.

278
00:25:14.292 --> 00:25:16.003
"No one wants a phone call

279
00:25:16.113 --> 00:25:17.583
at 2:00 in the morning.

280
00:25:17.793 --> 00:25:19.845
When you're 15,
it's a prank call.

281
00:25:20.044 --> 00:25:22.868
When you're 21,
it's a drunk boyfriend call.

282
00:25:23.167 --> 00:25:24.808
But after 25,

283
00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:27.609
it's usually really bad news.

284
00:25:28.073 --> 00:25:30.962
That's how I found out
my father died."

285
00:25:32.504 --> 00:25:33.896
Whose daddy died?

286
00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:38.623
(sobbing ) Can't you all
just please leave me alone?

287
00:25:38.891 --> 00:25:41.039
Johnny: No!

288
00:25:43.227 --> 00:25:45.415
Just tell me what you want.

289
00:25:47.338 --> 00:25:50.180
What do you want?
I offered you my money.

290
00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:51.958
Mm-hmm.

291
00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:56.052
Whoa!
( laughing )

292
00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:58.687
( gasps )

293
00:26:04.406 --> 00:26:07.289
Here. Here.

294
00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:10.618
Fine. I'll have a drink.

295
00:26:11.185 --> 00:26:12.493
Then you have to leave.

296
00:26:12.978 --> 00:26:16.592
- Andy: All right.
- Johnny: All right.

297
00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:21.116
That ain't shit.

298
00:26:21.294 --> 00:26:23.785
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.

299
00:26:24.348 --> 00:26:26.205
Now see, I--

300
00:26:27.222 --> 00:26:29.453
I know you can
do better than that.

301
00:26:30.431 --> 00:26:32.685
I'm sure that when you're
out there in the city

302
00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:35.364
with all your hoity-toity
rich friends,

303
00:26:36.242 --> 00:26:37.973
I bet you can throw 'em back
with the best of 'em.

304
00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:39.034
Now can't you?

305
00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:41.785
- I took the drink--
- I said drink that shit!

306
00:26:47.735 --> 00:26:51.310
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!

307
00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:53.732
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.

308
00:26:53.871 --> 00:26:57.064
-(coughs)
- All right, shit.

309
00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:00.213
See, that's not
so bad now, is it?

310
00:27:01.756 --> 00:27:05.536
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.

311
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.082
But we're even now, right?

312
00:27:10.342 --> 00:27:12.734
Okay?
Just please leave.

313
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.756
Please leave.

314
00:27:15.933 --> 00:27:18.519
Well, that's just not
what this is about no more.

315
00:27:22.543 --> 00:27:24.187
What is it about?

316
00:27:28.631 --> 00:27:31.300
I wanna see your teeth.

317
00:27:34.316 --> 00:27:35.460
What?

318
00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:39.239
You heard me,

319
00:27:39.902 --> 00:27:41.891
pretty little show horse.

320
00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:44.017
I want

321
00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:45.575
to see

322
00:27:46.884 --> 00:27:47.995
your teeth.

323
00:27:48.237 --> 00:27:49.818
( Laughing )

324
00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:51.741
That--

325
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:55.138
I don't want to-- no.

326
00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:04.603
Now you're gonna show
them teeth.

327
00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:07.795
You have beautiful teeth.

328
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:09.359
There.

329
00:28:09.465 --> 00:28:15.610
(whimpering )

330
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.887
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.

331
00:28:21.606 --> 00:28:23.910
Let's see more.

332
00:28:25.948 --> 00:28:27.075
Put your fingers

333
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.545
on the inside of your mouth
right there.

334
00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:34.086
Now take the other two,
stick 'em on the other side.

335
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:35.595
There you go.

336
00:28:36.705 --> 00:28:37.981
Now pull.

337
00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:41.479
- Okay, please, I'm begging you.
- No!

338
00:28:41.827 --> 00:28:42.985
No.

339
00:28:43.816 --> 00:28:46.037
(Groans)

340
00:28:48.838 --> 00:28:50.114
Again.

341
00:28:54.042 --> 00:28:55.749
Come here.
There it is.

342
00:28:55.932 --> 00:28:57.518
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!

343
00:28:57.866 --> 00:29:01.330
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.

344
00:29:01.529 --> 00:29:04.529
- (Sobbing)
- Shh!

345
00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:07.496
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.

346
00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:12.943
You know why I know you
ain't got no boyfriend?

347
00:29:13.761 --> 00:29:15.054
You know why?

348
00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:19.960
'Cause all them
city boys are faggots.

349
00:29:20.209 --> 00:29:21.551
Fuckin' A.

350
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.318
Since you ain't got
no boyfriend,

351
00:29:35.325 --> 00:29:37.297
well, shit, I figured that...

352
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.067
this would be
your man tonight.

353
00:29:45.691 --> 00:29:46.691
Yeah.

354
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.432
No?
Come here.

355
00:29:53.465 --> 00:29:55.110
Come on,
give him a little kiss.

356
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:58.189
Give him a little kiss,
come on.

357
00:29:59.647 --> 00:30:01.222
Give him a little kiss here.

358
00:30:01.504 --> 00:30:03.559
Give him
a little kiss here. Kiss him.

359
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.697
Oh shit, come on now.

360
00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:08.846
Come on now. I ain't talking about no
fucking peck like you gave Matthew.

361
00:30:08.998 --> 00:30:11.415
I want you to give him
a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.

362
00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:13.727
Get up on your knees.

363
00:30:17.933 --> 00:30:19.557
If I don't like
your enthusiasm,

364
00:30:19.723 --> 00:30:22.309
- I may come bad.
- ( gun cocks)

365
00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.784
Open up. Open up.

366
00:30:30.016 --> 00:30:32.403
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

367
00:30:32.585 --> 00:30:34.110
All right, all right.

368
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.491
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.

369
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.115
Just like it's your
first time again.

370
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:41.890
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.

371
00:30:42.056 --> 00:30:43.498
All right, all right.

372
00:30:43.672 --> 00:30:46.315
- ( Gagging )
- Shit!

373
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:51.122
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.

374
00:30:51.582 --> 00:30:54.603
( Stammers )
I d-don't want to.

375
00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:55.382
I don't.

376
00:30:55.551 --> 00:30:58.531
What?
What the fuck did you say?

377
00:30:59.243 --> 00:31:02.360
What the hell you mean
you d-d-don't want to?

378
00:31:02.636 --> 00:31:04.680
I don't want to, Johnny.

379
00:31:05.252 --> 00:31:07.315
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.

380
00:31:08.293 --> 00:31:09.337
Listen to me.

381
00:31:10.232 --> 00:31:11.658
Fuck that, man.

382
00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:14.194
- I ain't fucking waiting.
- Aw shit!

383
00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:16.967
Matthew:
She-she likes me.

384
00:31:17.182 --> 00:31:18.376
Johnny:
She likes you, Matthew?

385
00:31:18.873 --> 00:31:19.984
Go ahead.

386
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.464
- Jennifer: Please.
- Suck it, bitch.

387
00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:26.033
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.

388
00:31:26.181 --> 00:31:27.846
Go prove it to me.

389
00:31:28.851 --> 00:31:31.639
Uh-huh.
( laughs)

390
00:31:31.805 --> 00:31:33.761
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!

391
00:31:34.514 --> 00:31:36.513
( Screams )

392
00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:38.687
Johnny:
Come on, boys!

393
00:31:43.014 --> 00:31:48.014
( Sobbing )

394
00:32:12.072 --> 00:32:13.608
Whoa there.

395
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:15.663
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.

396
00:32:15.947 --> 00:32:18.265
(whimpering )

397
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:21.630
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.

398
00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:23.586
I was assaulted.

399
00:32:23.717 --> 00:32:25.460
He came into my cabin
and he had a gun.

400
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:27.630
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.

401
00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:29.280
It was in my mouth.

402
00:32:29.344 --> 00:32:31.093
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.

403
00:32:31.094 --> 00:32:32.453
I know this one.

404
00:32:32.636 --> 00:32:34.922
She rented the place
down on Mockingbird Trail.

405
00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:37.889
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.

406
00:32:38.227 --> 00:32:39.696
I'm a sheriff.

407
00:32:40.906 --> 00:32:42.165
You're safe.

408
00:32:42.563 --> 00:32:44.221
Now tell me what happened.

409
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.221
These four men--

410
00:32:47.369 --> 00:32:49.657
there were four men
and they broke into my cabin.

411
00:32:49.781 --> 00:32:52.238
And they had a gun
and they assaulted me.

412
00:32:53.018 --> 00:32:55.064
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?

413
00:32:55.342 --> 00:32:57.530
Yes, I'd seen them.

414
00:32:58.292 --> 00:33:00.260
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station

415
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.486
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.

416
00:33:02.668 --> 00:33:05.370
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.

417
00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:07.901
Sounds like them boys have
been up to no good again.

418
00:33:08.332 --> 00:33:10.586
All right, Earl,
you head on back.

419
00:33:10.984 --> 00:33:13.387
- Me and Miss--
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.

420
00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.476
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head
on over to the cabin

421
00:33:15.642 --> 00:33:16.984
and straighten things out.

422
00:33:46.189 --> 00:33:47.233
Miller!

423
00:33:48.675 --> 00:33:50.468
Miller, this is the sheriff.

424
00:33:51.161 --> 00:33:54.194
You and your boys are still here,
you come on out right now.

425
00:34:10.172 --> 00:34:14.067
Miller, if you're up there,
you'll be leaving by the window.

426
00:34:16.918 --> 00:34:18.310
Ma'am, stay here.

427
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:55.801
You here alone?

428
00:34:56.564 --> 00:34:57.675
Yes.

429
00:35:06.241 --> 00:35:07.603
With all this?

430
00:35:08.316 --> 00:35:10.222
I didn't plan on drinking it all
right away.

431
00:35:10.307 --> 00:35:12.196
I was gonna be here
for a couple months.

432
00:35:13.122 --> 00:35:14.664
You drink some this evening?

433
00:35:15.156 --> 00:35:16.222
Yes.

434
00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:38.581
One of them went upstairs
and he went through everything.

435
00:35:50.591 --> 00:35:52.073
They do this too?

436
00:35:52.437 --> 00:35:54.957
Please, I really don't care
about any of that.

437
00:35:56.466 --> 00:35:58.006
How long you been here?

438
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.559
Just a couple days.

439
00:36:02.332 --> 00:36:04.586
Anything strange happen
before this?

440
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:08.879
You have a run-in
with any of these guys?

441
00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:11.100
No, not really.

442
00:36:11.515 --> 00:36:13.719
Just stopped for gas
and directions.

443
00:36:16.139 --> 00:36:17.730
( Sniffs )

444
00:36:19.205 --> 00:36:21.465
Ma'am, is this your
marijuana cigarette?

445
00:36:22.212 --> 00:36:25.090
Um, no.

446
00:36:25.494 --> 00:36:27.798
One of the boys
must have left it.

447
00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:32.501
You mean to tell me one
of them guys is wearing lipstick?

448
00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:37.245
This ain't the big city.

449
00:36:38.306 --> 00:36:39.847
Please, I may have smoked a joint,

450
00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:42.383
but that doesn't mean
that I made any of this up.

451
00:36:44.032 --> 00:36:45.698
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.

452
00:36:45.817 --> 00:36:48.814
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?

453
00:36:49.279 --> 00:36:52.245
What could you possibly
need backup for? I'm the victim.

454
00:36:52.461 --> 00:36:56.472
Ma'am, you've been drinking,
smoking marijuana cigarettes.

455
00:36:57.035 --> 00:37:00.085
You got enough booze in here to put
the whole town three sheets to the wind.

456
00:37:01.063 --> 00:37:03.367
You're running around in your sleeping
garments at the crack of dawn.

457
00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:04.948
You gotta see this
from my point of view.

458
00:37:05.154 --> 00:37:08.734
What? They came in here
and they assaulted me.

459
00:37:08.867 --> 00:37:10.186
You have to believe me.

460
00:37:10.187 --> 00:37:12.501
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to get to the bottom of this.

461
00:37:12.716 --> 00:37:14.103
You're making serious accusations

462
00:37:14.104 --> 00:37:16.329
about boys I've known
since they was kids.

463
00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:20.470
And you haven't been
altogether truthful now, have you?

464
00:37:23.229 --> 00:37:26.503
Now please,
step up against the wall.

465
00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:40.629
Shoulder width apart.

466
00:37:52.215 --> 00:37:54.055
Ma'am, please.

467
00:37:55.132 --> 00:37:56.640
Look right ahead.

468
00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.062
( Sniffs )

469
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.392
( gasps )

470
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.265
Now...

471
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:22.082
I want the whole story.

472
00:38:23.557 --> 00:38:25.364
You tell me the whole thing.

473
00:38:28.104 --> 00:38:30.380
You start by telling me
what those boys did.

474
00:38:30.437 --> 00:38:32.800
Tell the sheriff the truth,
show horse.

475
00:38:37.939 --> 00:38:40.673
Better yet,
why don't you show him?

476
00:38:46.027 --> 00:38:48.032
Show him how that pretty little mouth
of yours couldn't get enough

477
00:38:48.148 --> 00:38:50.767
- as far as I recall.
- ls that right?

478
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.171
( Johnny coughs )

479
00:39:10.325 --> 00:39:11.635
They do this?

480
00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:14.618
Nice little tits.

481
00:39:16.756 --> 00:39:20.784
( Sobbing )

482
00:39:25.556 --> 00:39:26.614
(Groans)

483
00:39:27.463 --> 00:39:29.734
I asked you a question.

484
00:39:33.181 --> 00:39:34.839
Please.

485
00:39:37.093 --> 00:39:39.927
Johnny: You show the sheriff
your teeth there, show horse.

486
00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:41.880
( Clicks tongue )
Come on.

487
00:39:43.292 --> 00:39:45.281
- Come on, move.
- Andy: Get!

488
00:39:46.292 --> 00:39:47.717
Move!

489
00:39:57.029 --> 00:39:58.471
Now whinny.

490
00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:01.557
- I said whinny!
- ( whinnying)

491
00:40:01.707 --> 00:40:04.375
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!

492
00:40:04.955 --> 00:40:08.129
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!

493
00:40:08.295 --> 00:40:09.720
(whimpering )

494
00:40:09.944 --> 00:40:12.488
Huh.Huh.

495
00:40:16.765 --> 00:40:19.715
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.

496
00:40:20.378 --> 00:40:22.102
Johnny:
Keep whinnying, show horse.

497
00:40:22.277 --> 00:40:23.958
Stanley:
Here we go.

498
00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.428
Get on your knees.

499
00:40:29.146 --> 00:40:30.472
Keep whinnying!

500
00:40:30.819 --> 00:40:32.428
Oh-ho-ho!

501
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:36.803
( Screams )

502
00:40:38.428 --> 00:40:40.765
You oughta tame
that little mare of yours.

503
00:40:42.687 --> 00:40:44.361
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.

504
00:40:44.572 --> 00:40:46.731
On your feet or you're not
gonna get your sugar cube.

505
00:40:47.063 --> 00:40:48.696
Matthew,
get your clothes off, boy.

506
00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:50.030
We're gonna get
your cherry popped.

507
00:40:50.196 --> 00:40:51.505
Huh-uh.

508
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.107
Matthew, I ain't
asking you a question.

509
00:40:54.903 --> 00:40:57.057
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.

510
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.068
You wanna talk the talk,
you better walk the walk.

511
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.941
I'm walking.

512
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.001
- Jennifer: Stop, stop.
- Virgin.

513
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.796
Please stop.

514
00:41:12.365 --> 00:41:14.735
You get your clothes off
or I'm gonna slice her

515
00:41:14.851 --> 00:41:16.284
from the chin...

516
00:41:18.306 --> 00:41:20.295
- to cunt.
- Oh!

517
00:41:20.702 --> 00:41:24.090

518
00:41:28.214 --> 00:41:30.255
- Johnny: There's Matthew.
- Stanley: Now he gets it.

519
00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:31.996
Johnny:
Pants off, boy.

520
00:41:32.169 --> 00:41:35.842
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.

521
00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:40.523
Well, it's not totally his fault.

522
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.319
She ain't done much to get
his motor running now, has she?

523
00:41:45.595 --> 00:41:46.871
Dance.

524
00:41:49.258 --> 00:41:49.815
Dance.

525
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.463
Come on.

526
00:41:51.645 --> 00:41:53.767
- Come on, baby.
- Move it!

527
00:41:54.214 --> 00:41:57.396
Johnny: Prance for us.
Prance, show horse!

528
00:41:58.225 --> 00:42:01.481
Prance for us now. Come on,

529
00:42:01.482 --> 00:42:03.648
Whoo! Come on!

530
00:42:05.186 --> 00:42:06.148
I want you to watch this,
Matthew.

531
00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:07.805

- Hello, angel.

576
00:44:11.225 --> 00:44:12.773
Daddy's on a call.

577
00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:14.540
Girl:
Daddy, it's Sunday.

578
00:44:14.796 --> 00:44:16.761
You always make breakfast
before church.

579
00:44:16.944 --> 00:44:18.753
I know, I know, sweetheart.

580
00:44:18.923 --> 00:44:21.535
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.

581
00:44:21.817 --> 00:44:23.358
Okay.
Bye, Daddy.

You're the shit, Matthew.

587
00:44:41.408 --> 00:44:43.828
You're getting your ass beat
by a woman.

588
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.223
Johnny: Matthew,
you better control that bitch.

589
00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:50.562

Ain't that romantic?

600
00:45:34.722 --> 00:45:35.965
You clean that shit up.

601
00:45:36.164 --> 00:45:37.291
Make her do it.

602
00:45:37.523 --> 00:45:39.723
Andy:
You heard him. Clean it up.

603
00:45:39.978 --> 00:45:43.078
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?

604
00:45:43.266 --> 00:45:45.713
Stanley:
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.

605
00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:49.806
You can thank me later.

606
00:45:49.989 --> 00:45:52.857
- Andy: You calm down, boy.
- (Matthew coughing)

607
00:45:52.997 --> 00:45:54.835

No.

614

No, no.

615
00:47:23.962 --> 00:47:26.870
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.

616
00:47:27.251 --> 00:47:30.102
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.

617
00:47:31.527 --> 00:47:33.102
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?

618
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:35.680
Why don't you have a drink?

619
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:41.886
(Gasping)

620
00:47:42.118 --> 00:47:45.350
- Do it again!

Hold her down.
Hold her head down.

( Spits )
All right, boys,

623
00:47:57.099 --> 00:47:59.155
that filly's got a few more races
to run.

624
00:48:05.092 --> 00:48:06.298
You like that, girl?

625
00:48:06.532 --> 00:48:10.210
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.

626
00:48:11.585 --> 00:48:13.624
You got some fight
left in you, Miss Hills.

627
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.580
I like things rough.

628
00:48:15.742 --> 00:48:19.657
Please. Please.

629
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.884
- Yeah.

Don't worry now, sweetheart.

( Spits )

635
00:48:37.758 --> 00:48:39.323
I'm an ass man.

( playing blues tune )

640
00:49:29.282 --> 00:49:31.072
No teeth, show horse.

641
00:49:32.241 --> 00:49:33.690
No teeth.

642
00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:41.033
- Whoo!
-( laughing )

643
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:56.431
Andy:
God damn, Stanley.

644
00:49:56.553 --> 00:49:59.563
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.

645
00:49:59.746 --> 00:50:01.005
That bitch was too tight.

646
00:50:01.983 --> 00:50:04.305
Don't you know you're supposed
to wait for the lady?

647
00:50:04.817 --> 00:50:06.707
Stanley:
Shit, man, like she cares.

648
00:50:06.972 --> 00:50:08.828
She's laying there
like a dead fish.

649
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:12.038
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.

650
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.900
Andy: Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna

651
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.849
be the pussy today, huh?

652
00:50:17.959 --> 00:50:19.716
Johnny: Don't know what
you're bragging about, Andy.

653
00:50:20.906 --> 00:50:22.696
Clocked you
just over two minutes.

654
00:50:23.263 --> 00:50:24.705
Andy:
It's been a while, man.

655
00:50:25.053 --> 00:50:26.131
I'm out of practice.

656
00:50:26.369 --> 00:50:28.848
It's been, I don't know,
maybe 10 years.

657
00:50:31.002 --> 00:50:31.910
Where you going?

658
00:50:32.083 --> 00:50:34.251
God damn,
she's got some fight in her.

659
00:50:34.715 --> 00:50:39.506
(whimpering)

660
00:52:05.006 --> 00:52:06.671
Johnny:
Come on, let's chase.

661
00:52:07.492 --> 00:52:09.332
Andy:
Where does she think she's going?

662
00:52:13.193 --> 00:52:15.083
( Laughing )

663
00:52:26.101 --> 00:52:30.307
Well, it was fun
while it lasted, Miss Hills.

664
00:52:30.873 --> 00:52:36.267
( Heart beating )

665
00:52:43.628 --> 00:52:45.203
Johnny: Shit!

666
00:52:49.122 --> 00:52:50.209
Johnny:
Where is she?

667
00:52:53.747 --> 00:52:56.637
Hell, she's gotta
come up for air sometime.

668
00:52:57.068 --> 00:52:58.410
Shit.

669
00:53:10.099 --> 00:53:13.712
Stanley: Gators must have
got her by now. Right, Sheriff?

670
00:53:19.182 --> 00:53:20.309
Listen up.

671
00:53:21.664 --> 00:53:24.519
Creek ends about six miles
downstream in Watson.

672
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.602
Between here and there,
we're gonna find her.

673
00:53:28.132 --> 00:53:30.303
We split up.
We check the banks,

674
00:53:30.377 --> 00:53:31.530
in the timber, under rocks.

675
00:53:31.646 --> 00:53:34.265
Hell, you see a hole big enough
for her, I want you in there.

676
00:53:34.994 --> 00:53:38.060
And do not stop till y'all
find me a dead city whore.

677
00:53:55.323 --> 00:53:56.400
Nothing.

678
00:54:00.693 --> 00:54:02.632
Not a goddamn thing.

679
00:54:17.366 --> 00:54:18.476
Now what?

680
00:54:19.719 --> 00:54:22.173
Her body will show up one way
or another.

681
00:54:24.675 --> 00:54:26.680
Every day we're
gonna check the ravine,

682
00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.680
from the bridge
straight down through here and back.

683
00:54:29.956 --> 00:54:31.871
Two shifts a day
till we find something.

684
00:54:32.315 --> 00:54:33.724
For how long?

685
00:54:35.929 --> 00:54:38.663
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?

686
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:44.786
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.

687
00:54:45.207 --> 00:54:47.778
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?

688
00:54:47.906 --> 00:54:48.905
Yes sir.

689
00:54:50.664 --> 00:54:52.353
You get her wheels
down the shop.

690
00:54:52.619 --> 00:54:54.822
Strip it down to its
last goddamn nut.

691
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.728
That's gonna take two weeks.

692
00:55:01.452 --> 00:55:03.501
All right, Sheriff, yeah.

693
00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:05.800
I'll have Andy torch it out

694
00:55:05.876 --> 00:55:07.456
and I'll rub the numbers out.

695
00:55:07.672 --> 00:55:09.412
( Beeps )

696
00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:17.358
Asshole!

697
00:55:17.787 --> 00:55:20.805
The fuck you saving that for,
you moron?

698
00:55:21.137 --> 00:55:23.275
It's fucking evidence!

699
00:55:25.497 --> 00:55:28.065
I shit you not!

700
00:55:38.921 --> 00:55:43.958
( Breathing heavily )

701
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:46.229
I need you all on point
for this.

702
00:55:46.827 --> 00:55:49.494
And I mean goddamn
fucking point.

703
00:55:49.958 --> 00:55:51.069
We clear?

704
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:56.422
Now pony up!

705
00:55:57.301 --> 00:55:58.892
We got shit to do.

706
00:56:00.002 --> 00:56:01.792
Burn that effing tape.

707
00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:08.364
Andy:
Well, that's all of it,

708
00:56:08.927 --> 00:56:11.231
right down
to her little titty sling.

709
00:56:20.741 --> 00:56:22.856
Man, this fire's
making me hungry.

710
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:25.395
Well, there's a headline.

711
00:56:26.642 --> 00:56:28.561
We gotta finish this shit.

712
00:56:29.257 --> 00:56:31.246
We gotta get that car
in the garage.

713
00:56:31.624 --> 00:56:34.047
Then you can stuff your face
till you puke.

714
00:56:38.506 --> 00:56:39.798
Where the hell's Matthew at?

715
00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:42.069
He ain't one
to stay behind.

716
00:56:42.871 --> 00:56:46.870
He was looking around the water like
some crazed dog after a bone, man.

717
00:56:48.134 --> 00:56:49.424
You keep an eye on him.

718
00:56:49.766 --> 00:56:52.155
We gotta make sure
he keeps it together, you hear me?

719
00:56:53.199 --> 00:56:55.155
Just at least until
this shit's over.

720
00:57:21.993 --> 00:57:23.783
( Sighs )

721
00:57:34.656 --> 00:57:36.098
Gone all day,
I got nervous.

722
00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:39.132
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.

723
00:57:39.297 --> 00:57:42.198
The mess they got on Highway 1
took forever.

724
00:57:42.662 --> 00:57:43.921
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?

725
00:57:44.104 --> 00:57:45.148
Daddy.

726
00:57:45.894 --> 00:57:47.130
Got anything on the stove?

727
00:57:47.568 --> 00:57:50.338
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.

728
00:57:50.846 --> 00:57:52.137
Proud of what?

729
00:57:56.396 --> 00:57:58.949
I was accepted
to the honors program, Daddy.

730
00:58:00.636 --> 00:58:02.635
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.

731
00:58:02.756 --> 00:58:04.750
I expect nothing less
from my angel.

732
00:58:05.277 --> 00:58:07.319
Mommy and I are
proud of you.

733
00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:12.092
I'm gonna shower up.

734
00:58:30.444 --> 00:58:32.295
( Bell rings )

735
00:58:37.737 --> 00:58:40.449
Every time I come in here
this place gets worse.

736
00:58:40.648 --> 00:58:44.759
Yeah, and business keeps getting
better and better.

737
00:58:55.413 --> 00:58:56.723
Mockingbird Trail.

738
00:58:56.971 --> 00:58:58.148
Miss Hills.

739
00:58:59.176 --> 00:59:00.253
She left?

740
00:59:00.767 --> 00:59:02.320
She did indeed.

741
00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:05.436
I couldn't make head
nor tail of it.

742
00:59:06.149 --> 00:59:08.370
I found empty cases of booze,

743
00:59:08.602 --> 00:59:10.392
marijuana cigarettes.

744
00:59:10.696 --> 00:59:11.945
Crazy wild one.

745
00:59:12.198 --> 00:59:13.657
She'd have made
a preacher cuss.

746
00:59:13.836 --> 00:59:16.701
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?

747
00:59:17.328 --> 00:59:19.284
No refund policy.

748
00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:21.869
Christmas come early.

749
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:23.559
Enjoy it.

750
00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:28.034
Speaking of early,
next month's quail season.

751
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:29.926
I don't know about you,

752
00:59:30.371 --> 00:59:32.821
but I'm getting tired
of shooting squirrels.

753
00:59:33.997 --> 00:59:35.439
Me too.

754
00:59:53.002 --> 00:59:56.964
( Screaming )

755
01:00:08.752 --> 01:00:11.148
- Woman: Thank you.
- Johnny: You have a pretty smile.

756
01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.767
Did you just come here
to see me?

757
01:00:14.484 --> 01:00:16.004
Happy hour, boys.

758
01:00:16.454 --> 01:00:19.700
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.

759
01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:27.855
I just want all this bullshit
to be over.

760
01:00:41.707 --> 01:00:44.663
( Screaming )

761
01:00:56.185 --> 01:01:03.455
( rubber band snapping )

762
01:01:04.897 --> 01:01:05.941
No!

763
01:01:06.724 --> 01:01:11.724
(Gasping)

764
01:01:24.497 --> 01:01:31.193
( shouting )

765
01:01:38.766 --> 01:01:39.822
( laughing on TV)

766
01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:42.225
Woman: He's the big black guy
in the red drawstring.

767
01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:44.065
Man:
You're talking about the garbage man.

768
01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.938
Woman:
Well, give the man a turkey.

769
01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:48.632
( Telephone rings )

770
01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:52.195
- Hello.
- Earl: Yeah.

771
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.334
It's Earl.

772
01:01:56.281 --> 01:01:57.781
- Earl.
- Yeah.

773
01:01:57.961 --> 01:02:00.760
This woman leaves a message
on the machine.

774
01:02:00.901 --> 01:02:02.329
Barbara something or other.

775
01:02:02.981 --> 01:02:04.066
Yeah, so?

776
01:02:04.619 --> 01:02:06.644
She was asking
about that Miss Hills.

777
01:02:07.407 --> 01:02:09.588
Says no one's seen her
in over a month.

778
01:02:09.876 --> 01:02:12.097
Ain't that about the time
she split?

779
01:02:13.158 --> 01:02:14.103
Yeah.

780
01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:17.046
Yeah, and you know the story.

781
01:02:17.219 --> 01:02:19.672
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

782
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.755
I think you should
call her back.

783
01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:25.166
I mean, heck, Sheriff,

784
01:02:25.282 --> 01:02:27.685
you may have been
the last one to see her.

785
01:02:32.087 --> 01:02:33.205
Sheriff?

786
01:02:34.813 --> 01:02:36.122
Okay, I'll call her.

787
01:02:36.367 --> 01:02:38.476
Good.
You want the number?

788
01:02:40.348 --> 01:02:41.592
No, it's late.

789
01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.592
I'll get it from you
in the AM.

790
01:02:47.381 --> 01:02:48.796
We're still on
for tomorrow, right?

791
01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:50.658
Yeah, of course.

792
01:02:51.719 --> 01:02:52.547
( Beeps )

793
01:02:53.306 --> 01:02:54.884
Everything all right?

794
01:02:57.768 --> 01:02:59.028
Yeah, just fine.

795
01:02:59.264 --> 01:03:04.264
( Rock music playing )

796
01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.907
It's gone!

797
01:03:08.597 --> 01:03:09.962
Look at that.

798
01:03:10.642 --> 01:03:12.249
Looks like someone
spooked the cattle.

799
01:03:12.411 --> 01:03:14.410
(Andy laughing )

800
01:03:15.266 --> 01:03:16.177
(burps)

801
01:03:16.343 --> 01:03:18.780
( panting )
It's gone!

802
01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.326
It's fucking gone!

803
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.680
Jesus, Stanley,
calm the fuck down.

804
01:03:22.895 --> 01:03:24.130
What's got your nuts
in a sling?

805
01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:27.068
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.

806
01:03:27.967 --> 01:03:29.776
Maybe you accidentally ate it.

807
01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:32.276
Fuck off, man,
this is serious!

808
01:03:36.027 --> 01:03:37.386
It had the tape in it.

809
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.485
What are you talking about?

810
01:03:40.482 --> 01:03:41.278
The tape.

811
01:03:42.176 --> 01:03:43.751
The fucking tape.

812
01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:47.840
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?

813
01:03:48.193 --> 01:03:50.265
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.

814
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.178
I replaced it
with a new one.

815
01:03:53.139 --> 01:03:56.040
The Sheriff stomped
on the one that had nothing on it.

816
01:04:00.763 --> 01:04:01.940
You kept that tape, huh?

817
01:04:03.283 --> 01:04:05.106
You kept that tape,
you stupid piece of shit?

818
01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:07.692
Come here.
You kept that tape?

819
01:04:07.867 --> 01:04:10.095
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!

820
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:12.990
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?

821
01:04:13.156 --> 01:04:15.460
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.

822
01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:17.283
Come on.

823
01:04:17.963 --> 01:04:20.034
Gotta stick together
on this one.

824
01:04:21.364 --> 01:04:23.310
You're too dumb to know
how dumb you are.

825
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.194
- ( Coughing )
- You know that?

826
01:04:28.227 --> 01:04:31.128
( Panting )

827
01:04:31.807 --> 01:04:33.829
(coughs)

828
01:04:34.031 --> 01:04:39.031
(TV playing)

829
01:04:41.106 --> 01:04:42.929
( loud bang )

830
01:05:05.013 --> 01:05:06.952
( laughs )

831
01:05:08.228 --> 01:05:09.968
Uh-huh.

832
01:05:10.582 --> 01:05:12.040
Is that right?

833
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:16.996
Is that right?

834
01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.777
I better not find you,
you little fucker.

835
01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.364
( Loud bang )

836
01:05:57.802 --> 01:06:00.914
All right.
All right, let's go.

837
01:06:01.941 --> 01:06:03.632
Come on out, fucker.

838
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:05.671
Come on!

839
01:06:06.798 --> 01:06:08.671
You think this shit's funny?

840
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.510
Andy?

841
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:20.041
Stanley?

842
01:06:24.483 --> 01:06:26.273
Fucking pussies.

843
01:06:28.162 --> 01:06:31.676
All right. All right.

844
01:06:59.509 --> 01:07:00.699
( Loud bang )

845
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.356
That's it, God damn it.

846
01:07:03.997 --> 01:07:07.246
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!

847
01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:09.749
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!

848
01:07:09.928 --> 01:07:12.599
- Come on out, fucker.
- ( dog barking )

849
01:07:15.387 --> 01:07:19.892
- Oh shit.
- (rustling)

850
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.522
Come on.
Come on.

851
01:07:23.664 --> 01:07:25.478
Come on. Come on.

852
01:07:41.359 --> 01:07:43.208
Son of a bitch.

853
01:07:49.059 --> 01:07:50.137
Sweetheart.

854
01:07:54.567 --> 01:07:56.037
They're beautiful.

855
01:07:58.026 --> 01:07:59.566
I've been so busy.

856
01:07:59.816 --> 01:08:03.330
No need to explain.
You hadn't taken a single day off.

857
01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:05.037
You're only human.

858
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:05.916
I guess.

859
01:08:06.078 --> 01:08:08.750
Maybe you can help me with something
while I put these in water.

860
01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:09.927
Help with what?

861
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:12.993
I got this tape delivered,
but it don't fit our machine.

862
01:08:14.137 --> 01:08:15.280
What tape?

863
01:08:15.481 --> 01:08:18.579
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.

864
01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.160
Chastity see this?

865
01:08:26.607 --> 01:08:29.723
No. Like I said,
we couldn't get it to play.

866
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.063
Where is she?

867
01:08:32.528 --> 01:08:33.917
She's sleeping. Why?

868
01:08:37.957 --> 01:08:39.353
I'm gonna be back.

869
01:08:50.718 --> 01:08:52.130
Where the hell you been?

870
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:56.241
Beauty queen over here
doing his hair for two hours.

871
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:58.909
What's this all about, man?

872
01:09:00.434 --> 01:09:02.257
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?

873
01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.285
Right there.
That's where I got that.

874
01:09:04.478 --> 01:09:06.799
Somebody left me a present
last night on my doorstep.

875
01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:09.276
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!

876
01:09:10.105 --> 01:09:11.978
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.

877
01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.630
- ( Tires screeching )
- No one knows where he's at.

878
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.000
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.

879
01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:29.691
What?

880
01:09:30.882 --> 01:09:32.293
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.

881
01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:35.011
You wanna tell me why
this was dropped off to my house?

882
01:09:37.696 --> 01:09:38.906
To my wife!

883
01:09:39.022 --> 01:09:42.292
(groaning )

884
01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.384
What's on the tape?

885
01:09:46.303 --> 01:09:47.460
ls this some kind of fucked up joke?

886
01:09:47.596 --> 01:09:49.271
I smashed the damn thing myself!

887
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:53.063
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.

888
01:09:53.563 --> 01:09:55.396
The one you smashed
ain't got nothing on it.

889
01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.450
- You knew about this?
- No, Sheriff,

890
01:09:58.519 --> 01:10:00.508
I just found out about it myself.

891
01:10:02.482 --> 01:10:04.454
- Eat that tape, fat boy!
- ( grunting )

892
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:07.454
- Fucking tape!
- ( Andy laughing )

893
01:10:08.714 --> 01:10:10.073
You think it's funny?

894
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:14.896
You screwed up, fat boy.

895
01:10:15.758 --> 01:10:17.449
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.

896
01:10:17.793 --> 01:10:20.175
I mean, dipshit there,
he kept the tape as a souvenir,

897
01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.880
but Matthew's the one
that took it, Sheriff.

898
01:10:22.046 --> 01:10:25.450
Look at this. Silly bastard
left me a present last night.

899
01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:27.655
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.

900
01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.815
I think he even
feels guilty.

901
01:10:33.489 --> 01:10:35.527
You dipshits bring him to me.

902
01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:39.190
I'm gonna cut
his retard pecker off

903
01:10:39.339 --> 01:10:41.056
and use it as a goddamn
hood ornament.

904
01:10:41.311 --> 01:10:43.431
That's before I'm done shoving it
up your dirt hole.

905
01:10:43.632 --> 01:10:45.240
Shit, we've been looking
for him, Sheriff.

906
01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:47.568
Trust me, we've been
everywhere looking for him.

907
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.496
(coughs)

908
01:11:03.307 --> 01:11:05.232
I want him found tonight.

909
01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:08.100
Or I swear to Christ,

910
01:11:08.141 --> 01:11:10.730
I'll bring the wrath of God
down on you.

911
01:11:22.371 --> 01:11:26.709
(Car starts)

912
01:11:42.314 --> 01:11:46.615
(Gunshot)

913
01:11:47.031 --> 01:11:49.350
Can you believe there used
to be a limit on quail?

914
01:11:49.731 --> 01:11:51.902
Goddamn things
are like locusts now.

915
01:11:52.969 --> 01:11:55.085
Much to our good fortune.

916
01:11:57.594 --> 01:11:59.543
I gotta take a break.

917
01:11:59.969 --> 01:12:02.560
My dogs are barking
something fierce.

918
01:12:06.469 --> 01:12:08.470
I remember when you and my old man
chased that buck

919
01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:11.153
out from the hollows
on Stickler Farm before bagging it.

920
01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.799
Aww. Them were
the good old days.

921
01:12:17.639 --> 01:12:18.953
To the good old days.

922
01:12:19.495 --> 01:12:22.396
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?

923
01:12:22.549 --> 01:12:23.788
You just enjoy it.

924
01:12:32.257 --> 01:12:34.180
This is some fine whiskey.

925
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:40.047
Usually you don't get
something like this except at baptisms

926
01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:42.300
- and weddings.
- ( gun cocks )

927
01:12:42.382 --> 01:12:44.554
- And funerals.
- ( gunshot )

928
01:12:45.656 --> 01:12:49.742
(Gurgles)

929
01:12:52.626 --> 01:12:54.200
Loose ends, Earl.

930
01:12:58.733 --> 01:13:00.113
Loose ends.

931
01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:02.827
(Gunshot)

932
01:13:19.491 --> 01:13:21.393
- Jennifer: Matthew.
-(gasps)

933
01:13:24.024 --> 01:13:25.951
I'm over here.

934
01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.478
Jennifer: Matthew!

935
01:13:39.129 --> 01:13:42.241
- Matthew.
- ( gasping )

936
01:14:01.087 --> 01:14:06.087
( wood creaking )

937
01:14:11.461 --> 01:14:14.875
l-- I knew--
knew you were alive.

938
01:14:17.297 --> 01:14:18.720
I knew it.

939
01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:20.842
How did you know, Matthew?

940
01:14:21.464 --> 01:14:22.682
Huh?

941
01:14:23.345 --> 01:14:25.400
How did you know
I was alive?

942
01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:29.245
Are you sure
you're not dreaming?

943
01:14:32.247 --> 01:14:33.289
Am I?

944
01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:35.527
Am I dreaming?

945
01:14:36.322 --> 01:14:37.483
Come here.

946
01:14:38.577 --> 01:14:39.787
Sit with me.

947
01:14:50.162 --> 01:14:54.161
(Stammers)
I need to tell you--

948
01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:56.494
Shh!

949
01:14:59.626 --> 01:15:01.251
I know, Matthew.

950
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:05.345
I know this wasn't your fault.

951
01:15:07.399 --> 01:15:08.958
You tried to help me.

952
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:10.897
I did.

953
01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:14.577
I really really did.

954
01:15:18.455 --> 01:15:19.856
And-- and--

955
01:15:19.927 --> 01:15:21.803
and you're okay.

956
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.783
You're-- you're okay.

957
01:15:27.507 --> 01:15:30.341
Yes, Matthew.

958
01:15:33.623 --> 01:15:34.832
Now come.

959
01:15:40.041 --> 01:15:41.139
Come on.

960
01:15:42.199 --> 01:15:43.658
It's okay.

961
01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.393
It's okay.

962
01:15:48.183 --> 01:15:51.332
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Come on.

963
01:15:52.128 --> 01:15:56.874
I'm so sorry.
(crying )

964
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:05.508
Oh God!

965
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:14.873
I'm so sorry.

966
01:16:15.287 --> 01:16:16.547

967
01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:22.364
- Matthew.
- Yeah.

968
01:16:23.104 --> 01:16:25.348
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.

969
01:16:29.699 --> 01:16:31.073
Tell me again
how sorry you are.

970
01:16:31.134 --> 01:16:36.134
(Choking)

971
01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.176
(gasping)

972
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.973
l'm-- l'm-- I'm sorry.

973
01:16:58.025 --> 01:17:00.581
It's just not good enough!

974
01:17:06.494 --> 01:17:09.340
( Matthew choking )

975
01:17:10.103 --> 01:17:11.744

(Splashes)

983
01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:19.288
Matthew?

984
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:31.139
You're only making it harder
on yourself, Matt.

985
01:18:41.071 --> 01:18:43.445
Boo!
( laughing )

986
01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.093
Stupid fuck,

987

( Harmonica playing )

989
01:18:54.792 --> 01:18:56.880
Fucker's playing your song.

990
01:19:02.527 --> 01:19:04.526
Andy:
Your ass is grass, Matthew.

991
01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:06.976
Stanley:
Matthew, you're a dead man.

992
01:19:07.705 --> 01:19:09.130
Whoo!

994
01:19:13.987 --> 01:19:16.523
- Come on, man.
- (panting) I'm gonna kill him.

995
01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:18.876
Don't you pass out on me.

996
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:21.628
I'm too tired to drag
your ass back.

997

( Coughs, panting )

998

Can't talk, can you?

Maybe it's because
you're hungry.

1039
01:22:57.499 --> 01:23:01.046
You know, you gotta eat a lot
of nasty shit out here to stay alive.

Andy:
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

1073
01:26:14.646 --> 01:26:15.690
Wait.

1074
01:26:16.585 --> 01:26:17.828
It gets better.

1075
01:26:18.326 --> 01:26:21.943
Please, my eyes.

1076
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:24.446
I can't take it anymore.

1077
01:26:26.502 --> 01:26:27.861
Oh, let me help you.

1078
01:26:39.454 --> 01:26:40.843

Please. Please.

(grunting )

1085
01:27:02.198 --> 01:27:03.557
That might feel better.

1086
01:27:04.154 --> 01:27:07.469
( Qroans )

1087
01:27:08.281 --> 01:27:09.640

01:27:16.319 --> 01:27:18.938
Huh-uh-uh,
now don't drown too soon.

1091
01:27:22.846 --> 01:27:27.846
(bubbling)

1092
01:27:31.286 --> 01:27:32.264
Fuck you.

1093
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:34.999
Now is that any way
to talk to a lady?

1094
01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:45.398
(coughing )

1095
01:27:51.587 --> 01:27:52.644
I'm impressed.

1096
01:27:53.357 --> 01:27:54.883
You got a lot of fight in you.

1097
01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.784
Let's see how you do now.

1098
01:27:59.292 --> 01:28:02.126
- ( Sizzling )
- What's that?

1099
01:28:02.805 --> 01:28:05.089
It's just some lye
I found laying around.

1100
01:28:08.673 --> 01:28:09.817
No!

1101
01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.321
(Gasping)

1102
01:28:13.993 --> 01:28:17.225
Let's see how long you can keep
that pretty little face of yours.

1103
01:28:18.618 --> 01:28:20.093
Fuck you!

1104
01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:23.971
You already did that.

1105
01:28:24.353 --> 01:28:26.242
I didn't enjoy it much.

1106
01:28:26.561 --> 01:28:30.087
Now it's my turn
to fuck you.

1107
01:28:31.446 --> 01:28:33.319
- Please. Please.
- Oh.

1108

Pain in the ass.

1119

Good morning.

Whoo.

1121
01:30:25.389 --> 01:30:27.687
Hey there.
Can I fill you up?

1123
01:31:02.764 --> 01:31:04.488

(Sniffing)

1125
01:31:18.064 --> 01:31:20.136
Your mouth doesn't look
so good.

1126
01:31:21.031 --> 01:31:23.318
Maybe you should show me
your teeth.

1127
01:31:23.848 --> 01:31:28.722
(groaning )

1128
01:31:38.265 --> 01:31:39.674
( muffled ) I'll kill you.

1129
01:31:40.602 --> 01:31:41.911
I'll kill you.

1130
01:31:47.795 --> 01:31:49.403
Ornery stallion.

1131
01:31:51.309 --> 01:31:53.464
Guess I'm gonna
have to tame you.

( Screaming )

1133
01:32:08.821 --> 01:32:12.263
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.

1134
01:32:12.783 --> 01:32:14.722
I'm gonna have to
take care of that.

1135

1136
01:32:24.103 --> 01:32:25.594
Huh? Huh?

1137

No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!

1138
01:32:34.306 --> 01:32:36.510
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races

1139
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:38.174
left to run, show horse.

1140

1141
01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.813
That is disgusting.

1142
01:33:06.449 --> 01:33:09.101
Even your boys
didn't piss themselves.

1143
01:33:15.153 --> 01:33:16.493
Look who's here.

1144
01:33:18.962 --> 01:33:20.719
It's my boyfriend.

1145
01:33:22.675 --> 01:33:24.266
Remember him?

1146
01:33:25.874 --> 01:33:27.913
Why don't you give him
a little kiss?

1147
01:33:29.288 --> 01:33:31.427
Hmm? Hmm?

1148
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:33.900
Let's go, come on.

1149
01:33:34.113 --> 01:33:37.063
I don't take orders
from no fucking woman.

1150
01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.721
No?

1151
01:33:40.759 --> 01:33:42.900
(Gagging)

1152
01:33:43.809 --> 01:33:45.384
Breathe through your nose.

1153
01:33:45.616 --> 01:33:47.787
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.

1154
01:33:48.085 --> 01:33:50.273
Just like it was
your first time, remember?

1155
01:33:51.734 --> 01:33:55.108
(Gagging)

1156
01:33:55.316 --> 01:33:58.400

1157
01:33:58.731 --> 01:34:00.388
Fuck you!

Fuck you!

1159
01:34:04.615 --> 01:34:06.604

1161
01:34:16.797 --> 01:34:18.025
Let me tell you something:

1162
01:34:19.101 --> 01:34:20.195
You know,

1163
01:34:22.134 --> 01:34:23.900
you weren't even
a good blowjob.

1164
01:34:24.289 --> 01:34:28.217
(Laughing)

1165
01:34:29.922 --> 01:34:31.644
No.

1166
01:34:33.388 --> 01:34:36.488
You know what they do to horses
that can't be tamed, Johnny?

1167
01:34:41.567 --> 01:34:43.058
- You geld them.
-( blades snap )

1168
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:47.649
( shrieking )

1169
01:34:49.075 --> 01:34:50.255
No teeth, show horse.

1170
01:34:50.964 --> 01:34:52.307
No teeth.

1171

1176
01:35:55.434 --> 01:35:56.825
Hey, sweetheart.

1177
01:35:57.125 --> 01:36:00.755
- Chastity's new teacher's here.
- Storch: <i>Mrs. Novick?</i>

1178
01:36:01.416 --> 01:36:04.380
No, from the honors program.

- Oh yeah, that's right.

1180
01:36:09.587 --> 01:36:11.755
<i>- I'm real busy, sweetheart.</i>
- Hey, Daddy.

1181
01:36:13.549 --> 01:36:14.825
Hello, angel.

1182
01:36:15.123 --> 01:36:16.700
Daddy's real busy working.

1183
01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.901
But I really want you
to meet my new teacher.

1184
01:36:20.406 --> 01:36:21.831
She's way cool.

1185
01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:26.409
Here. Just say hi.

1186
01:36:29.509 --> 01:36:30.702
Howdy, Sheriff.

1187
01:36:32.203 --> 01:36:34.747
It's truly an honor
to speak with you, Miss...

1188
01:36:35.045 --> 01:36:37.010
Hills, Jennifer Hills.

1189

(Tires screech)

1190
01:36:42.453 --> 01:36:43.723
Excuse me?

1191
01:36:43.887 --> 01:36:46.689
I have to tell you it's been
a pleasure meeting your family.

1192
01:36:47.982 --> 01:36:49.261
You have a wonderful daughter

1193
01:36:49.418 --> 01:36:51.741
with a bright
and promising future.

1194
01:36:53.979 --> 01:36:56.325
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1195
01:36:56.531 --> 01:36:58.116
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

1196
01:36:58.355 --> 01:36:59.465
No, wait!

1197
01:37:00.758 --> 01:37:01.869
( Beeps )

1198
01:37:07.139 --> 01:37:08.150
Shit!

1199
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:16.092
(Tires squeal)

1200
01:37:30.634 --> 01:37:31.910
Chastity, where is she?

1201
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:33.390
She went to Hanson Park
with Miss Hills.

1202
01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:36.250
She wanted to get to know her students
in the program before the year st--

1203
01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:37.727
God damn it!

1204
01:37:38.197 --> 01:37:39.397
Who is she?

1205
01:37:42.369 --> 01:37:43.811
Who is this woman?

1206
01:38:07.255 --> 01:38:08.783
Chastity!

1207
01:38:15.303 --> 01:38:16.828
Chastity!

1208
01:38:19.453 --> 01:38:20.945
Where are you, angel?

1209
01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:31.383
Chastity!

1210
01:38:44.402 --> 01:38:47.070
(Horn blaring)

1211
01:38:55.835 --> 01:39:00.409
( gasps )

1212
01:39:00.639 --> 01:39:06.315
(grunting )

1213
01:39:12.944 --> 01:39:16.013
Oh, no! No!

1214
01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:18.033
Please!

1215
01:39:20.917 --> 01:39:25.431
(crying )
No.

1216
01:39:29.867 --> 01:39:31.430
Help me, Jesus.

1217
01:39:32.187 --> 01:39:33.763
Does that hurt, Sheriff?

1218
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:36.221
(grunting )

1219
01:39:36.771 --> 01:39:38.992
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.

1220
01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:42.357
Where is she, you bitch?

1221
01:39:43.764 --> 01:39:45.208
(groaning )

1222
01:39:45.904 --> 01:39:48.871
I'd be real careful
how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.

1223
01:39:50.478 --> 01:39:52.119
What have you done to her?

1224
01:39:55.706 --> 01:39:58.026
By her, I assume
you mean your daughter?

1225
01:39:59.661 --> 01:40:02.097
She really is lovely, Sheriff.

1226
01:40:05.694 --> 01:40:06.904
So young.

1227
01:40:08.395 --> 01:40:09.705
So sweet.

1228
01:40:11.926 --> 01:40:14.163
So innocent.

1229
01:40:18.291 --> 01:40:20.114
I mean, can you imagine?

1230
01:40:21.572 --> 01:40:22.981
Imagine what?

1231
01:40:28.401 --> 01:40:31.583
Imagine that somebody
had done something

1232
01:40:31.749 --> 01:40:34.103
like this... to her.

1233
01:40:34.406 --> 01:40:36.682
(grunting )

1234
01:40:37.339 --> 01:40:39.461
- Someone like Andy.
- ( screams )

1235
01:40:39.825 --> 01:40:42.411
Or Stanley or Johnny.

1236
01:40:43.223 --> 01:40:44.420
Or more likely you,

1237
01:40:44.521 --> 01:40:47.151
you sick, perverted rapist!

1238
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:50.748
(groaning )

1239
01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:54.991
- Deep, deep, deep!
- Fuck!

1240
01:40:55.179 --> 01:40:57.347
Deep! Deep!

1241
01:40:57.517 --> 01:40:59.308
Deep! Deep! Deep!

1242
01:40:59.896 --> 01:41:02.217
Jesus fucking Jesus.

1243
01:41:08.416 --> 01:41:13.831
(crying )
Please.

1244
01:41:15.775 --> 01:41:18.957
Ma'am.
Ma'am.

1245
01:41:27.974 --> 01:41:30.178
She's just an innocent girl.

1246
01:41:39.858 --> 01:41:40.968
So was I.

1247
01:41:48.659 --> 01:41:51.626
What are you doing? What?

1248
01:41:56.217 --> 01:41:57.394
Matthew.

1249
01:42:09.084 --> 01:42:11.123
You won't get
a-fucking-way with this.

1250
01:42:13.825 --> 01:42:15.631
You won't get away with this!

1251
01:42:18.515 --> 01:42:20.322
He'll be waking up soon.

1252
01:42:21.797 --> 01:42:23.830
If I were you,
