1
00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:24.136
There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

2
00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.087
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems

3
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.223
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

4
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.133
Banner, I know
where you're going.

5
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:33.095
But manipulating the immune
system is dangerous and stupid.

6
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:37.023
The president's science advisors
made it absolutely clear,

7
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.106
no human subjects.

8
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.255
Edith: David,
I have wonderful news.

9
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.180
I'm gonna have a baby.

10
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.114
What's it gonna be?

11
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.364
Look at that, Bruce.
Want a dinosaur?

12
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.744
Let's have a little fight.

13
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.489
You don't scare me.

14
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.209
That's a delicious eyeball.

15
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.336
You're big and green
and scary. I'm gonna run away.

16
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.945
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess what...

17
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.026
Bruce, you're hurt!

18
00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.954
Jack hit him with the stick, but
Bruce wouldn't hit him back.

19
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.241
He just stood there, shaking.

20
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.535
It's okay.

21
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.711
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

22
00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.846
Any other kid would've
wailed his head off.

23
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.305
That's Bruce. He's like that.
He's just so bottled up.

24
00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.809
The samples we found in your
lab, they were human blood.

25
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.726
You've ignored protocol.

26
00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.904
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

27
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.069
That's my business.
Wrong, banner.

28
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.194
It's government business,
and you're off the project.

29
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.807
Attention, all personnel!
Fail-safe has been initiated.

30
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.188
Gamma decontamination
will eccur in 30 minutes.

31
00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.645
Evacuate immediately. I repeat,

32
00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.851
evacuate immediately!

33
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:11.164
Edith? David, what's going on?

34
00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.380
I gotta talk to you, Edith.
Edith: Bruce, stay here.

35
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.422
What are you doing?

36
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.257
Edith: What are you doing?

37
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.633
David, please stop it! No!

38
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.218
David, no!

39
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.723
Edith: No! David: Yes!

40
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.809
David! No!

41
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.606
Bruce.

42
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.823
Bruce, wake up, son.

43
00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:23.153
Bruce. Bruce.

44
00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.658
Another nightmare?

45
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.122
I don't know.

46
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.329
I don't remember.

47
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.125
Hi, mom.

48
00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.088
Already off to college.

49
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.682
I'm gonna miss you terribly.
I'll miss you, too.

50
00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.514
Please, come here.

51
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:54.476
Look at you. Soon to be
a great scientist.

52
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.321
I guess. I mean, who knows?
I do.

53
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:03.034
There's something
inside you so special.

54
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.154
Some kind of greatness.

55
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:10.325
I'm sure someday you're gonna
share it with the whole world.

56
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.807
But as far as I'm concerned,
security ought to be...

57
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.468
Good morning, Dr. krenzler.
Good morning.

58
00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.599
Security ought to be
beefed up a lot more.

59
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.890
In a place like this
you can't be too careful.

60
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:18.522
Bruce! Big day. Did you sleep?
I didn't sleep.

61
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.692
I slept okay. Is Betty here?
She's around.

62
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.571
I really gotta say, seeing you
in that styling headwear...

63
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.077
You're implying something
about my helmet?

64
00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.410
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

65
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.328
Can I just ask?

66
00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.664
Were you wearing the helmet
while she dumped you?

67
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.295
See, it protects my very
important brain, Harper.

68
00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.790
Go prep the samples.

69
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.133
Hey. I found you. Betty, hey.

70
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.809
I hate them. Wait, I just got here.
Who do we hate?

71
00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.766
The review board. We have to
make a presentation on Tuesday.

72
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.940
And you're gonna
make it with me.

73
00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:02.562
You think I should? Yeah,
you're great with that stuff.

74
00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.273
You start talking about
microbes and nanomeds,

75
00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.908
you sound almost passionate.

76
00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.949
I'm sorry. That was rude.

77
00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.121
Look, nobody expects
this to be easy,

78
00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:20.289
us working together
after being so close.

79
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.506
We were close?

80
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.919
Look, if I could be more

81
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.465
whatever, you know. I'm just...

82
00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.810
Don't. It's not
your fault, really.

83
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.393
You're just a byproduct
of my inexplicable obsession

84
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.273
with emotionally distant men.

85
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.434
I'll get over us.

86
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:43.902
Good for you.

87
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.439
Anyway, I'm just really
stressed about this review.

88
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.316
If we don't get
impressive results today,

89
00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.860
we're gonna have a really
hard sell come Tuesday.

90
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.831
Well, then,
let's go be impressive.

91
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.410
Harper?

92
00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.421
Ready when you are.
Let's hit it.

93
00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.760
Are we passing inspection?

94
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:54.348
Safeties all going green.
Countdown's started.

95
00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.762
Nanomeds released.

96
00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.478
Four seconds.

97
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.739
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.

98
00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:14.744
Okay, let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

99
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.838
Gamma exposure.

100
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.212
Nanomeds now active.

101
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.557
Harper: Nanomeds
replicating cells on border.

102
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.097
It's working.

103
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:50.063
Harper: Cell copy to disassemble
ratio holding within 1%.

104
00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.997
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

105
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.491
You wanna go to
the review board on Monday

106
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.678
and tell them we've developed a
brand-new method for exploding frogs?

107
00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.685
Yeah, I think maybe
there's a market for it.

108
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:22.720
I mean, what if
there's a plague?

109
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.015
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

110
00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:31.654
I'm just... I'm just saying, you know,
frogs start falling from the sky,

111
00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.989
who do they come to?

112
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:38.365
We'd be world-renowned.
Make any parent proud.

113
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.447
I bet they would be.

114
00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.580
They actually did want me
to be a scientist.

115
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.912
I mean, your birth parents.

116
00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.336
Guess we'll never know.

117
00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:57.763
I don't understand why you don't
want to find out about them.

118
00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.300
They're dead. They died before
I could remember anything.

119
00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.762
Why do you always
come back to this?

120
00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:05.892
Don't know.

121
00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:09.521
I guess I figure there's more
to you than you like to show.

122
00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.937
I guess there
couldn't be any less.

123
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:17.275
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

124
00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.034
Nice work, Betty.

125
00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.167
Betty. <

126
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.420
Glenn. Hey.

127
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.765
What happened to your uniform?

128
00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.517
Oh, I switched over.

129
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.648
I'm still working
with your father, but...

130
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.755
Well, you know, the
military's subcontracting out

131
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:53.644
all the most
interesting work, and...

132
00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:57.072
Can't argue with the paycheck.

133
00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:00.238
I basically run all the labs
on the base now.

134
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.239
Re... hey, you're

135
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:07.913
you're looking good.

136
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.934
Ah, the good old college days.

137
00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.939
So, how's business?

138
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:36.941
What do you want?

139
00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:41.613
All right,
I'll cut to the chase.

140
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.462
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here.

141
00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:48.957
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

142
00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.953
How would you like
to come work for atheon?

143
00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:54.793
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now

144
00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.375
and own a piece of the patents.

145
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.139
You just have to say the word.
Two words, the door.

146
00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:26.821
General? Come in.

147
00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.708
Talbot wanted you
to see this, sir.

148
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:35.334
It's about a lab atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to desert base.

149
00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.336
Why isn't it going through nsc?

150
00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:43.763
It concerns your daughter, sir.

151
00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:53.855
Hi. Sorry.

152
00:19:56.487 --> 00:20:00.071
Hey, what happened to Benny? Is he
not working the night shift anymore?

153
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:03.278
Benny's dead. I'm the new guy.

154
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.075
Oh.

155
00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:09.905
Good to meet you. Same.

156
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.818
Let's try another.
No, stay here.

157
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.860
I look tired anyway.
Yeah, but you look great.

158
00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:47.947
What's the matter?

159
00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:54.493
It's these dreams, doctor. I keep
having them and they're terrible.

160
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.832
Tell me about your dream.

161
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.757
Well, it starts...

162
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.713
It starts with a memory.
I think it's my first memory.

163
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.633
It's this image I have

164
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.639
from when I was maybe
two years old.

165
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.384
Do you think it's just a dream?

166
00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:48.629
No, I think it's something
that happened

167
00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:51.970
when I was living at a
desert base with my father.

168
00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:56.645
Betty. Anyhow, the dream goes on

169
00:21:56.774 --> 00:21:59.561
and suddenly I'm alone.

170
00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.846
That's terrible.
You know I'd never hurt you.

171
00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:17.226
Hey, there.

172
00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.895
What's your name, darling?

173
00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:23.398
What's your name?

174
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:27.899
Okay. It's okay.

175
00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:22.510
David: I gotta talk to you, Edith.
Edith: Bruce, stay here.

176
00:26:43.477 --> 00:26:47.686
C, t, g, a,

177
00:26:51.902 --> 00:26:53.608
Bruce.

178
00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.946
My Bruce.

179
00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:14.170
Morning. Glenn dropped by.

180
00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.549
What's he doing here?
You know, Dr. krenzler,

181
00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:21.011
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

182
00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:24.594
Well, that's because I don't want to get
to know you, properly or improperly.

183
00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.968
So leave.

184
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:30.387
Hey, no worries.

185
00:27:39.616 --> 00:27:41.322
Let me give you
a little heads up.

186
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:46.787
There is a hair's breadth between
friendly offer and hostile takeover.

187
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:51.162
I've done my homework. The work
you're doing here is dynamite.

188
00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:54.002
Think, gls embedded
with technology

189
00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:56.834
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield

190
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:58.957
in our sole possession.

191
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:03.094
That's a hell of a business. Well,
it's not what we're doing here.

192
00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:05.889
We're doing the basic science
for everyone.

193
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:11.766
You know, someday I'm gonna write
a book and I'm gonna call it,

194
00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:15.979
when stupid ideals happen
to smart penniless scientists.

195
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:19.733
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

196
00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:46.338
About Glenn, I...
There's nothing to talk about.

197
00:28:49.853 --> 00:28:51.059
Okay.

198
00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:53.888
I just wanted to say,
don't worry about him.

199
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:55.647
I'll handle it.

200
00:28:58.612 --> 00:29:00.102
How?

201
00:29:01.198 --> 00:29:05.817
I'm gonna call my father, ask
him to exert some pressure.

202
00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:09.369
Last I heard, you and your
father weren't speaking.

203
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.198
Well,

204
00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:16.577
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

205
00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:19.754
Harper: I think this circuit's
kind of fried. I don't know.

206
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.916
Maybe you wanna
come take a look at it

207
00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:53.826
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

208
00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:58.577
Harper, get out!

209
00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:00.454
Get out!

210
00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:30.484
How's Harper? He's all right.

211
00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:32.535
You saved him.

212
00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:36.160
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

213
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:44.669
I don't understand
how this is possible.

214
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:48.001
You should be dead.

215
00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:51.801
They worked,

216
00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:53.682
the nanomeds.

217
00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:56.475
I mean, I feel great.
I feel like...

218
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:58.933
I don't know. They must
have, like, fixed me.

219
00:30:58.982 --> 00:31:02.770
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

220
00:31:05.781 --> 00:31:07.237
Are you sure the doctor checked?

221
00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:08.897
The doctor gave me
the full workup.

222
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.362
He wants to know where he
can get what I'm taking.

223
00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:13.660
I'm 100%.

224
00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:16.280
More.

225
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:20.204
What do you mean?
Remember my bad knee?

226
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:22.953
Well, now it's my good knee.

227
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:26.707
Bruce, this isn't funny.

228
00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.133
I was watching you.

229
00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:32.967
You were gonna die, and I was
gonna have to watch you die.

230
00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:37.851
Betty, I'm sorry.

231
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:41.851
Really.

232
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:45.730
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?

233
00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:47.568
Yeah.

234
00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:50.404
You should get some rest.

235
00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:52.949
And I'm fine, really.

236
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:57.078
I've never felt better.

237
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.729
Your name is not krenzler.
It's banner.

238
00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:11.190
What? Your name, it's banner.

239
00:33:12.282 --> 00:33:13.863
Bruce banner.

240
00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:16.149
Bruce.

241
00:33:18.622 --> 00:33:21.329
How did you get in here?
I work here now.

242
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.957
In the labs. The late shift.

243
00:33:25.212 --> 00:33:27.203
It keeps me close to you.

244
00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:31.381
You always work so late yourself
with your friend miss Ross.

245
00:33:32.761 --> 00:33:35.594
No, no. Please. Please. Let me.

246
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:41.007
You're not well.

247
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.477
You've had a terrible accident.

248
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:48.852
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

249
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:54.730
You're thinking
there's something inside.

250
00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:57.986
Something different,

251
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:01.611
inexplicable.

252
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.743
I can help you understand,
if you'll let me.

253
00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:11.583
If you'll

254
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:14.924
forgive me.

255
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:23.725
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

256
00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:29.064
So perhaps you should
leave now. I'll be fine.

257
00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:30.898
You must know.

258
00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:36.985
You may not want to believe it,
but I can see it in your eyes.

259
00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:40.818
.I!

260
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:44.579
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

261
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:48.575
But then you're something
else, too, aren't you?

262
00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:51.582
My physical son,

263
00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:54.631
but the child of my mind, too.

264
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:58.923
No. You're lying.

265
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:01.595
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

266
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:05.634
No, no, that's not true. That's
what they wanted you to believe.

267
00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:09.145
The experiments, the accident,
all top secret.

268
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:13.604
They put me away
for 30 years. Thirty years!

269
00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:19.231
Away from you.
Away from our work.

270
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.950
But they couldn't
keep me forever.

271
00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:25.362
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

272
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:29.749
You see,

273
00:35:30.045 --> 00:35:33.958
everything
your extraordinary mind

274
00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:37.549
has been seeking
all these years,

275
00:35:38.178 --> 00:35:40.043
it's been inside you.

276
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.216
Now we will understand it.

277
00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:45.381
We will harness it.

278
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.307
No, don't answer it.
It's miss Ross again.

279
00:35:50.357 --> 00:35:53.064
There's something you need
to know about her, Bruce.

280
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:54.732
Something troublesome.

281
00:35:54.944 --> 00:35:56.730
Let me protect you from her.

282
00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.983
No. Get out.

283
00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:01.902
Bruce... get out!

284
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:04.151
Sit!

285
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.013
We're gonna have to watch
that temper of yours.

286
00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:06.421
Betty: You sure you're okay?

287
00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:08.556
Bruce: Yeah,
just glad to be out of bed.

288
00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:14.392
Got a message from my father.
He's coming to see me.

289
00:37:15.191 --> 00:37:16.226
Your father?

290
00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:19.901
When? Lands in about an hour.

291
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:23.397
Betty. The funny thing is,
he called me.

292
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.577
Hi, dad.

293
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:49.430
Waitress: Here, ma'am. Thanks.

294
00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:51.432
You're welcome. Sir? Thank you.

295
00:37:51.478 --> 00:37:52.809
You're welcome.

296
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:07.316
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.
It's about Glenn, isn't it?

297
00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:10.777
He's been snooping
around my lab.

298
00:38:11.164 --> 00:38:15.453
Glenn noticed some things, asked
me to make some inquiries.

299
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.371
Are you here to question me?

300
00:38:21.883 --> 00:38:22.963
No.

301
00:38:23.927 --> 00:38:26.168
We've turned up
some surprising things.

302
00:38:29.224 --> 00:38:31.510
This krenzler you work with,

303
00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:34.141
you know who he really is?

304
00:38:35.355 --> 00:38:37.562
How much do you actually
know about him?

305
00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:43.276
I think the question is, what
is it that you know about him?

306
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:47.635
Well, right now,
I'm not at Liberty...

307
00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:51.072
Not at Liberty to disclose it to me.
Right. Right.

308
00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:56.073
You know, I think I was hoping

309
00:38:56.125 --> 00:39:02.166
that maybe this time you just
honestly wanted to see me again.

310
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.337
You've got this all wrong, Betty.
Do I?

311
00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:10.132
Yes. I do want to see you.

312
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.676
I really wish that
I could believe you.

313
00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:07.520
David: Everything
your extraordinary mind

314
00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:10.484
has been seeking
all these years,

315
00:40:11.284 --> 00:40:13.275
it's been inside you.

316
00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:35.075
Bruce on answering machine:
Hi, you've called dr krenzler

317
00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:37.431
please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.

318
00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:42.011
Betty: Bruce, hey.
Are you there?

319
00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:46.771
Look, I think I screwed up.
My father...

320
00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:50.274
It's like he suspects you
of something. I don't know.

321
00:40:51.074 --> 00:40:53.611
I was so impatient, like always.

322
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.776
I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, I...

323
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:59.821
That they're planning
something with the lab.

324
00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:00.954
So,

325
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.242
call me. Okay? Bye.

326
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.375
Betty?

327
00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:48.725
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!

328
00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:51.232
Send the Berkeley p.D. Now!
Send them now!

329
00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:20.419
Watch out!

330
00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:28.738
David: Edith? Edith:
David, what's going on?

331
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:32.666
I gotta talk to you, Edith.
Bruce, stay here.

332
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:07.322
My Bruce.

333
00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:23.258
Bruce?

334
00:46:00.049 --> 00:46:01.755
There was some
sort of explosion.

335
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:04.167
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

336
00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:08.170
I was worried about you.

337
00:46:09.058 --> 00:46:11.424
Well, I'm okay.

338
00:46:13.354 --> 00:46:15.310
What happened to you last night?

339
00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:19.023
I had the most vivid dream.

340
00:46:21.487 --> 00:46:23.148
It was like being born.

341
00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:27.820
Coming up for air. Light hitting my face.
Screaming.

342
00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:30.818
My heartbeat,

343
00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:34.492
it was like boom,

344
00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:37.165
boom,

345
00:46:39.338 --> 00:46:40.828
boom.

346
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:50.171
Were you at the lab? No.

347
00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:53.299
But something...

348
00:46:56.188 --> 00:47:00.101
And there was that man,
the one with the dogs.

349
00:47:00.693 --> 00:47:02.308
Who?

350
00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.315
That new janitor.

351
00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:08.064
He said he was my father.

352
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.825
I'll get it.

353
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:27.632
My father.

354
00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:38.765
My, my.

355
00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:42.473
So this is the young
Bruce ban...

356
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:46.272
Kre nzle r

357
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:51.199
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

358
00:47:55.456 --> 00:47:59.870
Mitchell, escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.

359
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:03.703
I'd rather stay here.
Now, Betty.

360
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:10.425
It's okay. I'll be fine.

361
00:48:21.524 --> 00:48:23.765
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.

362
00:48:31.784 --> 00:48:34.116
What? Your friend in there,

363
00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:38.371
there's a good chance he's caught
up in some very bad business,

364
00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:40.247
unfinished business.

365
00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:43.416
And I promise you, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

366
00:48:44.004 --> 00:48:46.620
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

367
00:48:46.674 --> 00:48:49.507
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

368
00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:51.918
And for the next
few days at least,

369
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:53.802
you're gonna stay away
from here.

370
00:48:54.056 --> 00:48:55.796
For your own good.

371
00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:07.149
Okay, and that's for the new
guy on the night shift, right?

372
00:49:08.028 --> 00:49:10.110
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

373
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:30.456
Dr. Ross.

374
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.250
How unexpected.

375
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.091
Please come in.

376
00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:44.512
I'm sorry to just show up
at your house like this.

377
00:49:49.528 --> 00:49:51.439
I came to ask you something

378
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:55.073
that I really have
no business asking.

379
00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:59.151
He told you?

380
00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:02.579
He said you talked to him. Oh.

381
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:05.415
Please sit down.

382
00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:16.339
Bruce was at the lab last night.

383
00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:18.253
He said that
you were there, too.

384
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.381
But he can't remember
much about it.

385
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.221
I need to find out
what happened.

386
00:50:23.896 --> 00:50:27.354
So, you want to know
what's wrong with him,

387
00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:30.145
so you can fix him?

388
00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:33.152
Cure him, change him.

389
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.026
My father's with the military.

390
00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:41.406
He seems to think he's involved in some
kind of threat to national security.

391
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:45.538
Your father. Ross.

392
00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:51.003
You brought your father
down upon his head?

393
00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:53.919
How little you understand,
miss Ross,

394
00:50:54.009 --> 00:50:57.376
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

395
00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:01.884
I'm sorry. Don't be sorry.

396
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:06.560
My son is unique.

397
00:51:07.356 --> 00:51:09.347
That's why you can't
relate to him.

398
00:51:10.192 --> 00:51:14.686
And because he is unique, the world
will not tolerate his existence.

399
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.069
Will they?

400
00:51:17.116 --> 00:51:18.777
But you,

401
00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.948
you try, don't you?

402
00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:27.159
Yes.

403
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.213
And a very beautiful
woman like you,

404
00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:37.712
your attentions

405
00:51:38.387 --> 00:51:41.845
can't be completely unwanted.

406
00:51:42.725 --> 00:51:44.261
Can they?

407
00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:46.929
No.

408
00:51:48.147 --> 00:51:51.105
Not with eyes like yours,

409
00:51:52.234 --> 00:51:56.728
watching expectantly, lovingly.

410
00:52:00.242 --> 00:52:03.075
But I'm afraid we're both
too late to help him.

411
00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:07.614
There's nothing I can do
for him or for you.

412
00:52:08.584 --> 00:52:09.915
Besides,

413
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:13.620
he's made it clear he wants
nothing to do with me,

414
00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:15.503
his choice.

415
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:19.508
Now if you'll excuse me, miss
Ross, I got some work to do.

416
00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:22.844
And don't worry about the dogs.

417
00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:26.803
You'll be fine. Just don't
look them in the eyes.

418
00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:31.269
Goodbye.

419
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:37.101
Ross: He gets released, and a month
later your lab is destroyed.

420
00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:38.644
What a coincidence.

421
00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:41.651
So you're just not gonna
tell me where he is, are you?

422
00:52:41.742 --> 00:52:43.607
How many times
do I have to tell you?

423
00:52:43.661 --> 00:52:45.401
I'd like to help you,
but I just don't know.

424
00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:47.536
You know who I am.
Right, banner?

425
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.809
You're Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.

426
00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.164
Let's cut the crap.

427
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.576
I'm the guy who had
your father tossed away,

428
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:54.664
and a lot more like him,

429
00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:57.125
and I'll do the same with you
if I feel so disposed.

430
00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:58.380
You understand?

431
00:52:58.425 --> 00:53:00.962
If you had him tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

432
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.876
I don't remember.

433
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.795
I was always told
my father was dead.

434
00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.429
Don't play with me!

435
00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:09.179
You were four years old
when you saw it.

436
00:53:10.604 --> 00:53:11.844
When I saw what?

437
00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:15.515
You were right there. How could
anyone forget a thing like that?

438
00:53:17.945 --> 00:53:19.276
What?

439
00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:22.317
Oh, some more
repressed memories.

440
00:53:25.828 --> 00:53:27.284
Just tell me.

441
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:31.872
I'm sorry, son.

442
00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:36.497
You're an even more screwed-up
mess than I thought you'd be.

443
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.456
Until we get to
the bottom of this,

444
00:53:40.634 --> 00:53:43.501
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site,

445
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:46.591
and you're not gonna get a security
clearance to get back into it

446
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:50.012
or any other lab that's doing
anything more interesting

447
00:53:50.394 --> 00:53:53.761
than trying to figure out the next
generation of herbal hair gel.

448
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:58.687
One more thing.

449
00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:03.571
If you ever come
within 1,000 yards

450
00:54:03.615 --> 00:54:05.822
of my daughter again,

451
00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:09.239
I'll put you away for
the rest of your natural life.

452
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:25.209
Dogs!

453
00:54:27.681 --> 00:54:30.718
Go! Go get her!

454
00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:33.634
And let nothing stand
in your way!

455
00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:36.098
Gol

456
00:55:40.796 --> 00:55:42.912
Hello? David: Bruce?

457
00:55:43.966 --> 00:55:48.050
So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.

458
00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:59.349
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

459
00:55:59.481 --> 00:56:01.017
I got a visit today.

460
00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:03.478
A very unwelcome visit.

461
00:56:03.986 --> 00:56:06.352
I'm afraid my hand
is being forced.

462
00:56:06.989 --> 00:56:09.526
What did you do to me?

463
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.657
You so much want to know,
don't you?

464
00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:16.866
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well

465
00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:18.788
as the experience.

466
00:56:20.168 --> 00:56:23.752
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

467
00:56:24.506 --> 00:56:27.043
If they'd only let me
work in peace...

468
00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:30.376
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

469
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:33.546
Bruce: So you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?

470
00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:36.381
And passed on to me, what?

471
00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:39.806
An alteration. Genetic.

472
00:56:40.314 --> 00:56:43.397
A deformity. I guess
you could call it that.

473
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:46.483
But an amazing strength, too.

474
00:56:47.112 --> 00:56:50.696
And now, finally unleashed,
I Ean harvest it.

475
00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:52.318
Bruce: No.

476
00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:56.076
You'll do no such thing. I will
isolate it and treat it myself,

477
00:56:56.371 --> 00:56:59.408
I'll remove it, and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

478
00:56:59.708 --> 00:57:02.745
I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

479
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:06.453
But would you really destroy
part of yourself?

480
00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:08.789
I don't think so.

481
00:57:09.885 --> 00:57:11.250
And as for Betty,

482
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:16.179
I'm sending her a surprise visit from
some four-legged friends of mine.

483
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:20.764
You see, I've managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

484
00:57:21.063 --> 00:57:23.054
and the results are tremendous.

485
00:57:23.815 --> 00:57:26.932
They're unstable,
but very powerful.

486
00:57:28.987 --> 00:57:30.602
What about my DNA?

487
00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:35.491
Let's just wait and see what
Betty makes of the results, huh?

488
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:39.119
No. You're crazy.
I won't let you.

489
00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:43.957
Get your hands off of me.

490
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.457
Talbot, what's this... inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.

491
00:57:47.673 --> 00:57:49.834
Listen to me, my father's
going after Betty...

492
00:57:49.883 --> 00:57:51.653
What makes you think
you can go behind my back

493
00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:53.292
and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

494
00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:56.720
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

495
00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:01.137
You pathetic freak.

496
00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:03.552
Betty's in danger. I swear
to you, she'll be killed.

497
00:58:03.605 --> 00:58:05.470
I can state the obvious.

498
00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:07.814
Something tells me you
aren't in much of a position

499
00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:10.316
to be making
stupid threats to anyone.

500
00:58:14.449 --> 00:58:16.485
Talbot. Yeah?

501
00:58:16.618 --> 00:58:18.324
You're making me angry.

502
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:20.160
Oh, am I?

503
00:59:16.303 --> 00:59:18.669
Man: My god, fire! Open fire!

504
01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.498
Bruce?

505
01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:40.493
He sent these dogs, didn't he?

506
01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.571
But I killed them!

507
01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.352
My god.

508
01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:13.609
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

509
01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.692
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

510
01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:18.697
No. Deeper.

511
01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:22.323
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

512
01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.953
Unleashed what?

513
01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:26.948
Me.

514
01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:33.583
It's okay.

515
01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.293
It's okay.

516
01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.002
What were those animals?

517
01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.096
My father sent them.

518
01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:44.723
He is my father.

519
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.726
He wanted me to change.

520
01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:50.855
He wanted me to change
into that mindless hulk.

521
01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.232
Why would he want that?

522
01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.944
Can you remember anything?

523
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:59.948
Is there anything
fromm when you were changed?

524
01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.069
It was like a dream.

525
01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:08.284
About what?

526
01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:11.663
Rage.

527
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.330
Power.

528
01:08:17.552 --> 01:08:19.008
And freedom.

529
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.402
Hello? Sir.

530
01:08:42.744 --> 01:08:44.575
Hello. Dad?

531
01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.612
Betty! Are you all right?

532
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:52.746
I'm scared. I need your help.

533
01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.627
Where are you?

534
01:09:05.266 --> 01:09:06.756
How are you?

535
01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.930
Okay, I guess.

536
01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.973
I think that somehow

537
01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.485
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

538
01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:24.361
How could it? We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

539
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.243
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

540
01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.321
Like what?

541
01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:35.834
Serious trauma.

542
01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.127
Repressed memories.

543
01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:50.517
Your father grilled me about something
that happened to me from early childhood

544
01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:52.847
that I'm supposed to remember.

545
01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:55.680
He did? It sounded bad, but...

546
01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.609
I honestly don't remember.

547
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.776
The thing that worries me

548
01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:11.371
a physical wound is finite,
but with emotions,

549
01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:14.491
what's to say it won't
just go on and on

550
01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.664
and start a chain reaction?

551
01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.716
You know
what scares me the most?

552
01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:27.420
When it happens,

553
01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:32.850
when it comes over me
and I totally lose control,

554
01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:37.347
I like it.

555
01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.746
It's okay. I got you. I'm sorry.

556
01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.750
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

557
01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.664
Target down. Target secure.

558
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.466
I'm going to take you
someplace safe.

559
01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.548
Okay? Bruce?

560
01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.172
Bruce?

561
01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:13.641
Bruce?

562
01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.415
Man: Clear!

563
01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.594
Attention on deck. Carry on.

564
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.021
Betty: We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

565
01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:16.111
How long are you
gonna keep him sedated?

566
01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.446
For the rest of his
natural life, if I have to.

567
01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:21.579
You said I could trust you.
I'm your father.

568
01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:26.288
You can trust me to do what I think is
right, not what you think you want.

569
01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:29.750
He is a human being.
He is also something else.

570
01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.791
Suppose he gets out, has one
of his little mood swings

571
01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:35.175
in a populated area.

572
01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:37.337
Yes, I'm aware of
the potential danger.

573
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.802
I'm also aware that
he saved my life.

574
01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:42.341
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

575
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.306
I'm indebted to him for that.

576
01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:48.974
He also put three men in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walking!

577
01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:54.945
Why is he such a threat to you?

578
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.198
Because I know
what he comes from.

579
01:14:57.243 --> 01:15:01.327
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

580
01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.996
He says he doesn't
know his father,

581
01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:08.501
but he's workin' in the same exact
goddamn field his father did.

582
01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:13.964
So either he's lyin' or it's
somethin' worse, and he's...

583
01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.170
What?

584
01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:19.049
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

585
01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:23.474
I was gonna say "damned."

586
01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.685
Of course you were.

587
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.061
But I'm a scientist.

588
01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:32.441
As a scientist, I believe we can
figure this out and he can be helped.

589
01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:34.982
I know you do.

590
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.197
Whether you know or care,

591
01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:43.865
I've got a lot of pride
in what you've done.

592
01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.413
But this is too big for you.

593
01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:50.873
Look, I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

594
01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:53.287
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

595
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.456
They can probe and prod
all they want,

596
01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:57.750
and in the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

597
01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.294
Nobody knows him
better than I do.

598
01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:06.808
What did David banner do to him?

599
01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.224
Cover left. Clear left.

600
01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:14.357
Cover right!

601
01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.699
What's happening here?

602
01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.031
My hand.

603
01:18:32.499 --> 01:18:35.832
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA

604
01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:41.289
combined with nanomed
reconstruction...

605
01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:47.174
You see, I can partake with
the essences of all things.

606
01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.552
Gonna have to ask you to

607
01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.305
put your hands up, pal, okay?

608
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.725
Nice and easy.

609
01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:08.237
Do you really believe
that I am separate from you?

610
01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:11.823
Whoa!

611
01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:28.798
Where am I?

612
01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.050
You're home.

613
01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:50.653
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

614
01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:55.620
I must have seen you
or known you.

615
01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:58.453
If only I could remember.

616
01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:35.277
This is my old house, isn't it?

617
01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:16.702
Let's go.

618
01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:19.742
Please try.

619
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:17.179
Betty: What is it? Nothing.

620
01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:20.428
Really?

621
01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:24.770
Damn it.

622
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.526
Okay, Betty.

623
01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:35.155
What do you want to know?

624
01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.489
What was in that room?

625
01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:53.165
What are you afraid
that I'll see?

626
01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:01.932
See? There's nothing.

627
01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.393
It's empty.

628
01:23:18.118 --> 01:23:20.359
Betty: What do you mean
I don't have access to him?

629
01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.870
NSA has decided
to turn over study

630
01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:26.243
of the threat to atheon.

631
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:31.332
But you're head of the base.
I thought you were in charge.

632
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:34.839
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

633
01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:41.630
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

634
01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:47.478
Oh, there's a lot of powerful
people that want in on this.

635
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.271
And money to be made,
lots of it.

636
01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.864
You know the worst part
about all this?

637
01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:02.363
When I had David banner locked
up and sent that kid away,

638
01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:06.496
I didn't give that boy a second thought.
He was just collateral damage.

639
01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:09.165
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

640
01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:14.087
What can I do?

641
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.882
You can go home now.

642
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.047
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye,
but I've already been informed

643
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.718
that for now all further contact
is out of the question.

644
01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:29.311
Right.

645
01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:12.104
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin"?
Grub okay in here for ya?

646
01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:16.437
What do you want?
That's a good question.

647
01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:21.655
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

648
01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:25.533
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again,

649
01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.821
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you,

650
01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:32.123
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

651
01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:35.164
Do you mind?

652
01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:38.000
I'll never let you.

653
01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:41.299
I'm not sure you've got
much of a choice.

654
01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:45.762
Come on, Bruce. Aren't you
feeling a little angry?

655
01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:47.489
After all, you've only got
me to play with

656
01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.724
now that Betty's dumped you
and gone back to Berkeley.

657
01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.219
You're lying.

658
01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:55.014
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

659
01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:57.649
You turn green, and all these
guys come in and kill you,

660
01:25:57.694 --> 01:25:59.230
and I perform the autopsy.

661
01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.314
You don't...

662
01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:04.276
And I mop the floor with you

663
01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:07.159
and maybe by accident go
too far and break your neck.

664
01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:11.621
Bad science, maybe,
but personally gratifying.

665
01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:17.540
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

666
01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:20.456
Never.

667
01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:29.340
You know, consciously
you may control it,

668
01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:32.676
but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

669
01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:05.876
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

670
01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.305
Edith: Bruce.

671
01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:35.614
PR ee

672
01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:39.038
there are two guards
right outside.

673
01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:43.421
You don't have to worry. I'm not
angry with you. Not anymore.

674
01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:46.754
What do you want?

675
01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:49.590
It's over for me now.
I know that.

676
01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.930
And soon it'll be
over for Bruce.

677
01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.264
That's why I've come to you

678
01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:59.931
to ask you if you could
persuade your father,

679
01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:03.191
as a man, as a father himself,

680
01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:07.938
that if I turn myself in now,
peacefully

681
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:11.032
and before
he puts me away forever,

682
01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:14.115
that he would let me see my son

683
01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:16.571
for one last time.

684
01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:19.541
Could you do that for me?

685
01:28:22.923 --> 01:28:25.460
It's out of
my father's hands now.

686
01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:33.221
I understand. He's a puppet now.

687
01:28:34.935 --> 01:28:37.472
I don't blame him.
You shouldn't.

688
01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:41.392
You should blame yourself for
what you've done to your son.

689
01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:45.275
And what have I done to my
son, miss Ross? Nothing.

690
01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:49.567
I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

691
01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.236
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

692
01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:58.996
My nature! Knowledge of oneself

693
01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:01.491
it's the only path to the truth

694
01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:10.797
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

695
01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:14.671
All you've given Bruce is fear.

696
01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.599
Fear of life.

697
01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:23.142
Fear?

698
01:29:25.318 --> 01:29:27.104
Perhaps, miss Ross.

699
01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.317
And loneliness, too.

700
01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.440
Yes.

701
01:29:35.245 --> 01:29:36.951
I feel them both.

702
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:44.869
But I have lived
completely once.

703
01:29:47.173 --> 01:29:49.129
David: I was so much in love,

704
01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.876
and she so much wanted a baby.

705
01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:54.548
My baby.

706
01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.643
I could tell
from the moment she conceived

707
01:30:05.775 --> 01:30:08.391
that it wasn't a son
I had given her

708
01:30:08.778 --> 01:30:10.609
but something else.

709
01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.029
A monster, maybe.

710
01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:16.195
I should have put
a stop to it right then,

711
01:30:16.286 --> 01:30:20.279
but I was curious,
and that was my downfall.

712
01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:24.707
And as I walched
this tiny life unfold,

713
01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:28.287
I began to imagine
the horror of it,

714
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:32.003
and my curiosity was replaced

715
01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:34.880
with compassion.

716
01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:40.261
David: But they took away
my chance to cure him.

717
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:42.346
Your father threw me out.

718
01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:46.601
Edith: What are you doing?
I remember that day so well,

719
01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:51.110
every moment, every sensation
walking into the house,

720
01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:54.771
the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.

721
01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.160
I knew I was doing a father's work,
fulfilling a father's mercy.

722
01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:03.113
Edith:
David, please stop it! No!

723
01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.782
David, no! Talk to me! Listen!

724
01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.668
But then she surprised me.

725
01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:13.464
Edith: No! No!

726
01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:15.087
David, no!

727
01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:17.176
David: It was as if

728
01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:20.638
she and the knife

729
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.300
merged.

730
01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:34.731
No!

731
01:31:34.781 --> 01:31:37.147
You cannot imagine

732
01:31:37.784 --> 01:31:40.992
the unbearable finality of it.

733
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.787
And in that one moment

734
01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:48.659
I took everything
that was dear to me

735
01:31:49.713 --> 01:31:53.626
and transformed it
into nothing more

736
01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:55.840
than a memory.

737
01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:14.984
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

738
01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:21.945
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

739
01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:29.249
Sir, negative
on drill penetration.

740
01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:31.376
Damn it, drill him harder!
Give him full rpms.

741
01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.036
Come on, holeman! Come on!

742
01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.636
Should I neutralize? No! I
can't do anything with goop!

743
01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:50.974
Come on!

744
01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:06.411
All right, put him to sleep.

745
01:33:15.882 --> 01:33:17.838
Technician:
It's not stopping him!

746
01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:26.931
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

747
01:33:26.976 --> 01:33:30.218
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

748
01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.227
I must have a sample of him.

749
01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:33.388
Woman: Sir!

750
01:33:36.069 --> 01:33:39.311
Jesus! Hit him with the foam.

751
01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:41.441
Technician:
Deploy containment foam.

752
01:33:42.242 --> 01:33:44.073
Talbot, talk to me.

753
01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:46.989
Cease firel

754
01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:49.370
under control, general. I'll
let you know if we need you.

755
01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:52.282
Unacceptable. Unseat your
asses down there immediately.

756
01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:55.247
I want a full-court evacuation now.
I'm shutting you down.

757
01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:56.502
Lockdown.

758
01:33:56.965 --> 01:34:00.207
Didn't you hear what the general said?
I said lockdown!

759
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.802
Clear! I need a sample of him!

760
01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:10.683
Take it easy there, buddy.

761
01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.477
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

762
01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:29.486
Fall back! Fall back!
Clear your weapon! Clear it!

763
01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:32.906
Give me the m2.
So long, big boy.

764
01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:34.874
Clear!

765
01:34:45.805 --> 01:34:48.717
Lockdown the entire
facility immediately.

766
01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.686
Target's still moving
towards blue level.

767
01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:57.688
Evacuate the main hall.

768
01:35:03.781 --> 01:35:07.273
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

769
01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:09.575
Set firing lines left and right!

770
01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:12.529
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

771
01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:36.894
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.

772
01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.226
Data's on backup power supply.

773
01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:47.522
Incoming!

774
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:58.037
Shut down all power
to the main hall.

775
01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:01.374
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.

776
01:38:11.177 --> 01:38:13.884
Driver, stop. Driver, stop.

777
01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:23.849
Commander: Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!

778
01:39:07.024 --> 01:39:08.980
Clear back! Clear back!

779
01:40:02.955 --> 01:40:06.197
Mr. president,
I have some bad news, sir.

780
01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:08.623
Let's have it, general.

781
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:10.409
I've briefed the president
on angry man.

782
01:40:10.463 --> 01:40:11.999
I assume that's what
this is about.

783
01:40:12.048 --> 01:40:13.333
It is, ma'am.

784
01:40:13.382 --> 01:40:16.624
I'm requesting a national
command authority override.

785
01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:19.089
Angry man is unsecure.

786
01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:24.136
I need everything we have at my
disposal in order to stop his movement.

787
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:27.347
You're expecting
civilian casualties, general?

788
01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:29.603
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

789
01:40:29.774 --> 01:40:32.231
Consider it done.
Keep us posted.

790
01:41:20.866 --> 01:41:22.902
Contact Goodman control.

791
01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:25.076
Ross: Patch data to the assets.

792
01:41:25.413 --> 01:41:26.903
Contact h.Q.

793
01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:31.074
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation

794
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:34.786
in vicinity of
grid coordinates 6-5-15.

795
01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:13.575
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

796
01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:15.289
Confirm area cleared.

797
01:42:15.338 --> 01:42:18.796
Man on radio: H.Q. Confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir,

798
01:42:18.841 --> 01:42:21.127
Ross: Gentlemen,
it's time to dig in.

799
01:42:21.177 --> 01:42:24.214
I want this target
stopped in his tracks.

800
01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:16.520
Jesus.

801
01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:35.243
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

802
01:43:40.923 --> 01:43:44.916
Tango one: Tango four is down.
Have csar respond to our 20 asap.

803
01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.261
Tango four: We're okay, but, damn it, get
him off us before he tears us apart!

804
01:43:49.306 --> 01:43:51.922
Tango one: I've got no shot. Do
you have a clear line of fire?

805
01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:54.217
Ross: Watch it, tango flight.

806
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:56.727
Tango one:
Break left! Break left!

807
01:43:57.857 --> 01:44:00.394
Man: Tango three, pull back and
set up for a hellfire shot

808
01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:02.809
Ross: Hold your fire
till we draw him off

809
01:44:03.028 --> 01:44:05.189
tango one:
Tango one is hot. Gun wazzed.

810
01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:07.525
Tango two. Roger.
Going hot. Guns ready.

811
01:44:13.038 --> 01:44:14.619
Ross: Engage at will.

812
01:44:35.394 --> 01:44:37.976
Tango two: Tango one,
pull back! Clear my line!

813
01:44:38.147 --> 01:44:41.105
Tango three: Tango flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for hellfire.

814
01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:42.560
Roger that.

815
01:44:43.736 --> 01:44:46.102
Tango one clear. Take the shot

816
01:45:04.924 --> 01:45:07.290
Tango three: Tango one, tango three.
I have contact

817
01:45:07.676 --> 01:45:10.042
holy shit! He's got my missile!

818
01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:13.512
Mayday! Mayday!

819
01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:19.644
Mayday! Mayday! We're hit!
We're going down!

820
01:45:23.442 --> 01:45:25.057
Give me a head count.

821
01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:27.647
Tango two: Tango three,
give me a sit rep.

822
01:45:28.197 --> 01:45:31.155
Tango three: Our kite's
busted up, but we're okay.

823
01:45:33.077 --> 01:45:35.568
Ross: Tango flight, do you
have eyes on the target?

824
01:45:36.664 --> 01:45:38.746
Tango one.
I have him in the rocks.

825
01:45:38.791 --> 01:45:41.453
Ross: Salvo all.
Turn it into a parking lot.

826
01:46:02.648 --> 01:46:04.764
Tango one: T-bolt,
your parking lot is ready.

827
01:46:04.817 --> 01:46:07.479
We're bingo
for fuel and ammo. R. T b.

828
01:46:35.014 --> 01:46:36.894
Woman on radio: T-bolt,
this is Goodman control.

829
01:46:36.932 --> 01:46:40.550
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.

830
01:46:40.853 --> 01:46:42.059
Damn!

831
01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:44.019
=7 g p

832
01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.181
it appears he's heading home.

833
01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:51.736
Launch fast movers. Have
them intercept and engage.

834
01:46:54.491 --> 01:46:55.651
Hello?

835
01:46:55.701 --> 01:46:57.692
Betty, Bruce got out.

836
01:46:57.745 --> 01:47:00.908
He's headed your way
and probably right for you.

837
01:47:00.956 --> 01:47:02.947
How far from the base are you?

838
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.163
I'm already here. They're
taking his father in now.

839
01:47:06.754 --> 01:47:09.917
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

840
01:47:24.188 --> 01:47:27.100
Pilot: Legend one rolling in hot.
Legend two breaking off left.

841
01:47:27.775 --> 01:47:30.938
I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.

842
01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:33.940
Ross: Acquire a clear target.
Eire at will.

843
01:47:39.078 --> 01:47:42.366
Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.

844
01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:50.290
Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!

845
01:47:51.924 --> 01:47:54.381
I can't pull up!
I can't pull up!

846
01:48:02.851 --> 01:48:05.968
Okay, you've got him now. Take him
on a ride to the top of the world.

847
01:48:06.021 --> 01:48:08.979
Let's see what the thin air
will do for him.

848
01:48:09.692 --> 01:48:11.648
Pilot: Initiating afterburn.

849
01:48:28.794 --> 01:48:32.457
I'm passing flight level 600.
This is out of my envelope.

850
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:35.080
Ross: Hang in there, legend.

851
01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:38.338
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

852
01:48:38.387 --> 01:48:40.594
He'll lose consciousness
before you.

853
01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:49.429
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!

854
01:49:36.945 --> 01:49:38.731
Puny human.

855
01:49:47.748 --> 01:49:51.081
Pilot: Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.

856
01:49:51.210 --> 01:49:53.201
Ross:
Let's not take any chances.

857
01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:56.120
You are cleared to fire
on target, legend.

858
01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:20.102
Betty: Dad? Betty?

859
01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:22.733
We don't have a choice.

860
01:50:22.783 --> 01:50:24.774
I have to destroy him.

861
01:50:24.868 --> 01:50:26.028
But you can't.

862
01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:29.616
You will only fuel his rage, and
you will make him stronger.

863
01:50:30.332 --> 01:50:33.119
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

864
01:50:35.087 --> 01:50:36.998
Then let me go to him.

865
01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.125
Please.

866
01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:43.633
Just give him a chance
to calm down.

867
01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:07.901
Ross: All aircraft vicinity of San
Francisco, this is t-bolt on guard.

868
01:51:08.287 --> 01:51:11.404
This area has been declared
restricted airspace.

869
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:15.658
All aircraft are ordered to
clear the airspace immediately.

870
01:51:57.836 --> 01:51:59.676
Man on radio: Echo, one-niner.
Weapons are hot.

871
01:51:59.713 --> 01:52:02.204
Target acquired.
Waiting your order to engage.

872
01:52:02.257 --> 01:52:04.964
Repeat,
waiting your orders to engage.

873
01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:08.218
Pilot: Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.

874
01:52:18.315 --> 01:52:20.101
All units, hold your fire.

875
01:52:20.150 --> 01:52:22.086
Technician on radio:
This is t-bolt to all assets.

876
01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:23.588
You have direct orders
to hold your fire.

877
01:52:23.612 --> 01:52:25.898
I repeat, hold your fire.

878
01:52:26.031 --> 01:52:27.817
Pilot: Echo, one-niner.
Roger that.

879
01:52:42.631 --> 01:52:44.542
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

880
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:16.282
Officer: Hold your fire
until my command!

881
01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:22.247
Man on radio: Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.

882
01:54:29.821 --> 01:54:31.357
You found me.

883
01:54:33.825 --> 01:54:36.157
You weren't that hard to find.

884
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:39.740
Yes, I was.

885
01:55:45.897 --> 01:55:47.603
I et's take a walk.

886
01:56:19.598 --> 01:56:22.931
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base

887
01:56:22.976 --> 01:56:26.309
until we get the final word from
c-3 on how to dispose of him.

888
01:56:27.355 --> 01:56:31.439
In the meantime, if he does anything
but sit there in that chair,

889
01:56:33.028 --> 01:56:36.486
we're gonna turn on the juice and
he'll be incinerated immediately.

890
01:56:36.531 --> 01:56:39.318
We've established
a 200-yard perimeter, sir.

891
01:56:39.618 --> 01:56:41.825
If we deploy
the electromagnetic array,

892
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:43.906
there should be
no collateral damage.

893
01:56:43.997 --> 01:56:45.077
Man: Here they come!

894
01:56:52.881 --> 01:56:55.167
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

895
01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:59.464
But one way or another, we're gonna
have to prepare for the worst.

896
01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:50.870
I should have killed you.

897
01:58:51.916 --> 01:58:54.157
And I should have killed you.

898
01:58:55.587 --> 01:58:57.202
I wish you had.

899
01:59:03.261 --> 01:59:05.126
I saw her last night.

900
01:59:07.349 --> 01:59:08.885
Saw her face.

901
01:59:10.226 --> 01:59:11.636
Brown hair.

902
01:59:13.647 --> 01:59:15.103
Brown eyes.

903
01:59:16.441 --> 01:59:18.147
She smiled at me.

904
01:59:19.444 --> 01:59:21.435
She reached down
and kissed my cheek.

905
01:59:24.324 --> 01:59:26.656
I can almost remember a smell.

906
01:59:30.955 --> 01:59:33.162
It was like desert flowers.

907
01:59:35.126 --> 01:59:36.991
Her favorite perfume.

908
01:59:40.256 --> 01:59:44.169
It's my mother, and I
don't even know her name.

909
01:59:52.268 --> 01:59:56.056
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.

910
02:00:03.154 --> 02:00:04.860
Go ahead and cry.

911
02:00:08.993 --> 02:00:11.234
Cry. Crying will do you good.

912
02:00:11.329 --> 02:00:12.910
Don't touch me!

913
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:18.036
Maybe once you were my father,

914
02:00:19.295 --> 02:00:22.128
but you're not now
and you never will be.

915
02:00:22.173 --> 02:00:23.788
Oh, is that so?

916
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:30.220
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

917
02:00:31.182 --> 02:00:33.798
I came here to see my son.

918
02:00:35.145 --> 02:00:36.681
My real son.

919
02:00:37.313 --> 02:00:39.224
The one inside of youl.

920
02:00:40.233 --> 02:00:44.067
You're nothing
but a superficial shell,

921
02:00:44.195 --> 02:00:46.527
a husk of flimsy consciousness

922
02:00:46.698 --> 02:00:49.781
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

923
02:00:49.951 --> 02:00:53.364
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

924
02:00:59.377 --> 02:01:02.619
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

925
02:01:03.548 --> 02:01:04.788
For me.

926
02:01:05.675 --> 02:01:08.087
My cells can transform, too,

927
02:01:08.386 --> 02:01:10.877
absorb enormous
amounts of energy.

928
02:01:11.222 --> 02:01:13.713
But, unlike you,
they're unstable.

929
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:17.433
Son, I need your strength.

930
02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:21.099
I gave you life.

931
02:01:21.483 --> 02:01:24.475
Now you must give it back to me!

932
02:01:25.445 --> 02:01:30.109
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

933
02:01:30.158 --> 02:01:33.525
Stop it. Stop? Stop what?

934
02:01:33.703 --> 02:01:35.785
Stop what?

935
02:01:36.581 --> 02:01:40.620
Think about all those men
out there in their uniforms,

936
02:01:41.336 --> 02:01:44.123
barking and swallowing orders,

937
02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:47.793
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

938
02:01:48.426 --> 02:01:51.008
Think of all the harm
they've done!

939
02:01:51.596 --> 02:01:53.928
To you! To me!

940
02:01:54.557 --> 02:01:56.013
To humanity!

941
02:01:56.935 --> 02:01:59.768
And know this,
that we can make them

942
02:01:59.813 --> 02:02:02.646
and their flags and their
anthems and their governments

943
02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:04.976
disappear in a flash!

944
02:02:05.276 --> 02:02:06.937
You in me.

945
02:02:07.278 --> 02:02:08.859
I'd rather die.

946
02:02:10.573 --> 02:02:12.985
Oh, that's your answer?

947
02:02:14.035 --> 02:02:18.404
Then indeed you shall die
and be reborn

948
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:22.248
a hero of the kind
that walked the earth

949
02:02:22.544 --> 02:02:26.162
long before the pale
religions of civilization

950
02:02:26.381 --> 02:02:28.997
infected humanity's soul!

951
02:02:29.133 --> 02:02:31.124
Gol

952
02:02:46.818 --> 02:02:48.558
Stop your bawling,

953
02:02:49.487 --> 02:02:52.149
you weak little speck
of human trash.

954
02:02:59.122 --> 02:03:01.909
All right. I'll go!

955
02:03:03.626 --> 02:03:06.413
You just watch me go! Hit it.

956
02:03:32.488 --> 02:03:33.728
Hit it again!

957
02:03:33.781 --> 02:03:35.237
We can't, sir. There's no power.

958
02:03:35.283 --> 02:03:37.615
Some kind of
counter-electromagnetic field.

959
02:03:42.707 --> 02:03:45.198
Move in and assault
the target. Move in!

960
02:03:45.376 --> 02:03:47.958
Man: Move, move, move!

961
02:04:37.345 --> 02:04:40.303
Sir, I've located them
on radar. Pear lake.

962
02:04:40.348 --> 02:04:42.304
Call up the task force.

963
02:04:49.732 --> 02:04:50.847
Yes.

964
02:05:56.424 --> 02:05:58.585
David: That's right. Keep fighting.

965
02:05:59.844 --> 02:06:03.177
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

966
02:06:12.023 --> 02:06:15.982
Technician: Strange. We're reading a
phenomenal drop in temperatures there.

967
02:06:16.486 --> 02:06:18.943
Simultaneous
radiological activity.

968
02:06:18.988 --> 02:06:21.855
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

969
02:06:29.499 --> 02:06:31.080
Betty: Relax.

970
02:06:32.001 --> 02:06:34.913
David: Sleep now, Bruce,
and forget forever.

971
02:06:35.713 --> 02:06:40.377
Struggle no more
and give me all of your power.

972
02:06:42.303 --> 02:06:45.420
Bruce: You think you can
live with it? Take it!

973
02:06:46.557 --> 02:06:48.718
Take it all!

974
02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:55.100
David: Oh, yes! Yes!

975
02:07:08.788 --> 02:07:10.324
David: Take it back!

976
02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:15.120
It's not stopping!

977
02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:18.206
Take it back!

978
02:07:34.522 --> 02:07:36.979
Gentlemen, release.

979
02:07:45.116 --> 02:07:46.822
Pilot on radio:
Gamma charge away.

980
02:08:11.976 --> 02:08:13.512
Sweet dreams.

981
02:09:07.448 --> 02:09:09.780
Hello? Ross: Betty, is that you?

982
02:09:09.825 --> 02:09:12.532
Hi, dad. I'm glad I caught you.

983
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:15.156
I'm glad you called. Thanks.

984
02:09:17.541 --> 02:09:21.079
Look, Betty, you and I...

985
02:09:22.213 --> 02:09:26.252
Well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.

986
02:09:26.884 --> 02:09:29.421
But... well, you know...

987
02:09:31.347 --> 02:09:33.929
What is it? Well, you know.

988
02:09:33.975 --> 02:09:37.217
The usual loonies,
seein' things.

989
02:09:37.603 --> 02:09:39.594
Only now everything's green.

990
02:09:41.232 --> 02:09:42.472
Right.

991
02:09:43.401 --> 02:09:44.857
Look...

992
02:09:46.279 --> 02:09:48.941
If by some chance
he did survive,

993
02:09:50.074 --> 02:09:53.817
,

994
02:09:55.288 --> 02:09:57.495
You'd tell me, wouldn't you?

995
02:09:58.541 --> 02:10:01.123
No, I wouldn't.

996
02:10:02.586 --> 02:10:05.828
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

997
02:10:06.048 --> 02:10:09.381
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

998
02:10:09.427 --> 02:10:11.383
I'm under surveillance.

999
02:10:14.015 --> 02:10:15.971
I'll tell you, though,

1000
02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:18.465
that if he were alive,

1001
02:10:21.814 --> 02:10:25.898
because as much as

1002
02:10:27.987 --> 02:10:30.069
I loved him. I...

1003
02:10:33.075 --> 02:10:34.235
Yeah.

1004
02:10:37.538 --> 02:10:39.244
I'm sorry, Betty.

1005
02:10:41.125 --> 02:10:42.661
I am so sorry.

1006
02:10:45.963 --> 02:10:47.544
I know you are.
