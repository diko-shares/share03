1
00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.824
Unit 40 requesting assistance.

2
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:34.426
We have a possible
211 in progress

3
00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:37.096
at the Valley Trust Bank,
Boyle and Kittridge.

4
00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.763
We have shots fired.

5
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.608
All units,
officer needs assistance.

6
00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:42.934
Boyle, north of Kittridge,
at the Valley Trust Bank.

7
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.969
Shots have been fired.

8
00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:46.981
We're going to need some
type of heavy-duty vehicle to do this

9
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.574
because we are all pinned
down by automatic gunfire.

10
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.343
15-L-10, advise.

11
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.012
You need some kind of heavy-duty
machinery to get the officer up.

12
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.656
They've
got automatic weapons.

13
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.482
There's nothing we have
that can stop them.

14
00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.116
Shots being fired!
Shots being fired!

15
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.769
Suspects heavily
armed and wearing body armor.

16
00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:23.708
Officer down!
Officer down!

17
00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.278
Requesting SWAT.
Code 3.

18
00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.079
I'm killing whoever moves!

19
00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:29.881
You move, I'm killing you!

20
00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:32.684
What are you looking at, huh?
What are you looking at?

21
00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:45.697
SWAT's just arrived.

22
00:01:45.764 --> 00:01:47.432
We're 30 seconds out, boys.

23
00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.833
All right.

24
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.838
Let's rock 'n' roll.

25
00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.535
This is a table.

26
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:59.137
We have four cameras
over the tellers.

27
00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:01.172
Do we have a visual?
Almost.

28
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.574
We cut their phones?
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.576
As soon as you get tapped
in, let me have it.

30
00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:25.364
10-David standing by,
position three.

31
00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:49.988
Suspect's trying to get
in the driver-side door.

32
00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.123
Do not let them get mobile.

33
00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:56.295
He's down.

34
00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.797
God damn it!

35
00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.566
Grab somebody. Grab somebody
and bring them up here!

36
00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:02.967
Get up.
No.

37
00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.569
I said get up!
No!

38
00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.996
Let's throw a body out there and
tell them we mean business.

39
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:17.316
Street, 10-David. The
storeroom is clear, almost to the lobby.

40
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:18.617
Shut up!

41
00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:22.954
10-David to Street.
Hold your position.

42
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.956
10-David wants us to hold.

43
00:04:25.023 --> 00:04:26.325
God damn it!
God damn it!

44
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.493
We hold, they die.

45
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:34.098
I guess we're not holding.

46
00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:36.535
I swear to God,
I'm going to kill somebody!

47
00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:16.775
Take a headshot.

48
00:05:23.047 --> 00:05:24.549
They just capped Eddie!

49
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.193
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

50
00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:27.452
Shut up!
I'm thinking!

51
00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:34.459
10-David
to all units.

52
00:05:34.526 --> 00:05:36.395
We are sending in
a secure phone.

53
00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.214
Stop whining! I'll put
a bullet in your head!

54
00:06:00.685 --> 00:06:01.920
Shut up.

55
00:06:03.888 --> 00:06:05.590
What are they doing?

56
00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:11.295
This is Rick from the LAPD.

57
00:06:11.362 --> 00:06:12.631
Can you hear me okay?

58
00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:14.699
10-David to Street.
Hold your position.

59
00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:16.334
CNT has him on the phone.

60
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:18.002
10-David to
the one-four corner.

61
00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.638
Confirm that you
have containment.

62
00:06:19.704 --> 00:06:21.606
Roger, we're holding
on the one-four corner.

63
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.708
10-David
to all units.

64
00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:27.245
Confirm that you're holding.

65
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:28.923
10-David,
we're holding top of stairwell.

66
00:06:28.947 --> 00:06:30.014
Shut up.

67
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.592
Gamble, Street,
where the hell are you?

68
00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:32.884
Why aren't you responding?

69
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:34.453
Let's be cool, now.
Calm down.

70
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.155
I'm controlling this
situation, you understand me?

71
00:06:39.257 --> 00:06:40.459
We need to go!

72
00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:45.163
No, please.

73
00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:51.069
Help me.

74
00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:52.975
Gamble, Street. Why aren't
you responding? Now!

75
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.402
Kill that bitch
and throw her out front!

76
00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:22.601
Get that guy off our fence!

77
00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:23.968
I said
to kill that bitch

78
00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:25.570
and throw her out front!

79
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.405
I'm on TV!

80
00:07:52.497 --> 00:07:54.533
Street, 10-David.
Lobby is clear.

81
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.200
Two suspects are neutralized.

82
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.337
I need an RA unit for a
gunshot wound to a hostage.

83
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.013
You're going to be fine, ma'am.

84
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.515
Ambulance is on the way.

85
00:08:10.582 --> 00:08:12.116
Got them, right?

86
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:17.889
Jimbo?

87
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.525
She'll be okay?

88
00:08:20.592 --> 00:08:21.793
I'm not a doctor.

89
00:08:26.497 --> 00:08:28.800
You're going to be fine.
You're going to be fine.

90
00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:39.277
Mmm-mmm, mmm.

91
00:08:39.343 --> 00:08:41.946
Boss is going to tear you
guys a new one, huh?

92
00:08:42.013 --> 00:08:45.216
Same place he did the last
time, time before that...

93
00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:46.585
Good luck.

94
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.720
I don't care what they say.

95
00:08:48.787 --> 00:08:50.221
You guys were heroes out there.

96
00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:54.826
That was some
cocky shit out there.

97
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.180
You know how
to play this, right?

98
00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:07.872
That woman is alive
because of what we did.

99
00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:10.809
Yeah, alive and suing
the city for millions.

100
00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:12.753
Chief says if he's going to
pay, somebody else does too,

101
00:09:12.777 --> 00:09:14.779
and it sure as hell
isn't going to be me.

102
00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.123
Come on, Fuller.
We get two seconds to make...

103
00:09:16.147 --> 00:09:17.716
Captain Fuller.

104
00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:19.760
Captain Fuller, we get
two seconds to make a decision.

105
00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:22.220
You get two months to sit
there and tear it apart.

106
00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:24.923
SWAT means
"Special Weapons and Tactics."

107
00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:26.858
Where were your
tactics out there?

108
00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:28.960
Saving a woman
from getting shot.

109
00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.528
That's where our tactics were.

110
00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:32.239
Every cop in this department
knows we did the right thing.

111
00:09:32.263 --> 00:09:34.474
Sometimes doing the right thing
isn't doing the right thing.

112
00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:35.658
What the hell does that mean?

113
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.068
Sergeant...

114
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.740
You disobeyed a direct order.
End of story.

115
00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:43.074
You're both off SWAT.

116
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:45.143
Captain... They're two
of our best officers.

117
00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:47.254
Well, I'm not sticking them back in
the field after a stunt like that.

118
00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:49.814
Sorry. I didn't know that saving
lives was a goddamn stunt.

119
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.282
Hey, you've got a big mouth,

120
00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:52.893
and apparently, you're
quick on the trigger,

121
00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:54.986
and that is why
your ass is in a sling.

122
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.964
Captain Fuller, if
you're going to put them off SWAT,

123
00:09:56.988 --> 00:09:58.857
at least keep them
in the division.

124
00:09:58.923 --> 00:10:00.959
Give them a shot
at getting back.

125
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.911
Fine. Stick them in the gun cage.
Get them out of my sight.

126
00:10:10.935 --> 00:10:12.837
Gun cage?

127
00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.005
This is total bullshit.

128
00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.606
What?
I said, "This is bullshit."

129
00:10:15.674 --> 00:10:16.908
Really?
Yeah, really.

130
00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:18.152
You should consider
yourself lucky

131
00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:19.896
Lieutenant Velasquez
is standing up for you.

132
00:10:21.512 --> 00:10:23.490
Yeah, I'm lucky I don't have to
work for an asshole like you...

133
00:10:23.514 --> 00:10:25.149
That's it!
You're out of here, Gamble!

134
00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:27.318
You're gone!

135
00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:28.896
Get out of here. What the
hell's the matter with you?

136
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.288
Street!

137
00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.190
You stay.

138
00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:33.424
Hey...

139
00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:38.329
Give us a minute.

140
00:10:44.535 --> 00:10:46.070
Please, sit down, hmm?

141
00:10:46.137 --> 00:10:47.706
I'll stand.

142
00:10:51.575 --> 00:10:53.277
Look, Jim,

143
00:10:53.344 --> 00:10:55.546
we both know that Gamble
is a bad influence

144
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:56.948
on the rest of the team.

145
00:10:57.015 --> 00:10:59.050
Gamble's a good cop.

146
00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.953
Unlike him, you still have
a chance at a future here.

147
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.055
You go on record
that Gamble acted recklessly

148
00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.066
and that you had no choice
but to follow your partner in

149
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.692
after he disobeyed orders,

150
00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:10.494
and I will make sure that you are
back on SWAT tomorrow morning.

151
00:11:15.566 --> 00:11:17.568
Let's get the hell
out of here, huh?

152
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.803
I need a cocktail.

153
00:11:22.373 --> 00:11:23.541
I'm staying.

154
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.646
You're what? What?

155
00:11:29.714 --> 00:11:31.382
After that?

156
00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:34.185
Couple months, Fuller will find
some new asses to chew out.

157
00:11:34.252 --> 00:11:35.754
We'll be back on the team.

158
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.124
Fuller is the cockroach
of this department, brother.

159
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:42.026
He's not going to give
us any second chance.

160
00:11:42.093 --> 00:11:43.327
What are you going to do, huh?

161
00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:45.296
Piss away all the hard work
you did to get here?

162
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:48.867
Piss what away, Jimmy?

163
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.335
The cage?

164
00:11:51.402 --> 00:11:52.403
Come on, man.

165
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:56.574
We're better than that,
and you know it.

166
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.976
You going to come with me?

167
00:12:04.315 --> 00:12:06.117
Oh.

168
00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.519
A real partner wouldn't
have to ask that, would he?

169
00:12:08.586 --> 00:12:11.389
A real partner would step up
to what he did in the bank.

170
00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.093
Yeah.
I saved the hostage.

171
00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:16.904
You disobeyed the hold.
No, I saved that hostage.

172
00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:18.830
You disobeyed the hold!

173
00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:22.100
You made the decision yourself,

174
00:12:22.166 --> 00:12:23.367
and you shot a hostage.

175
00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:24.668
Jesus, Brian!

176
00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:27.939
Wow.

177
00:12:28.907 --> 00:12:31.409
You sound a lot like Fuller.

178
00:12:31.475 --> 00:12:33.395
Is that what you two were
talking about in there?

179
00:12:35.646 --> 00:12:37.849
Did you rat me out?

180
00:12:37.916 --> 00:12:40.084
Did you cut a deal to get
back on the team, Jimmy?

181
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:41.953
Did I cut a deal?
Yeah, did you?

182
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.540
How many times have I covered up
for one of your goddamn stunts?

183
00:12:46.257 --> 00:12:47.792
That's what a partner's
supposed to do.

184
00:12:50.929 --> 00:12:53.798
You just picked a paycheck
over me, bro.

185
00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:57.001
You just picked yourself
over everything else.

186
00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.570
You want to stay here
and be Fuller's bitch,

187
00:13:00.604 --> 00:13:02.440
you go right ahead.
I can't do it.

188
00:13:03.774 --> 00:13:05.743
Can't do it.

189
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.846
Damn it. God damn it.
God damn it, Jim!

190
00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.881
Partners for five years.

191
00:13:09.948 --> 00:13:11.582
This is how you want to end it.

192
00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:12.984
Oh...

193
00:13:14.485 --> 00:13:16.254
I didn't end it.

194
00:13:19.023 --> 00:13:20.691
You sold me out to the brass.

195
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.163
You know I never realized till
now how full of shit you are.

196
00:13:33.905 --> 00:13:35.373
Fuck you

197
00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:36.841
and SWAT.

198
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.791
* Shattered

199
00:13:55.493 --> 00:13:56.861
* Shattered

200
00:13:56.928 --> 00:13:58.172
* Love and hope
and sex and dreams

201
00:13:58.196 --> 00:13:59.830
* Are still surviving
On the streets

202
00:13:59.898 --> 00:14:03.868
* Look at me I'm in tatters

203
00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:07.705
* I've been shattered

204
00:14:09.107 --> 00:14:10.774
* Shattered

205
00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:13.677
* Friends are so alarming
My lover's never charming

206
00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:16.214
* Life's just a cocktail party
On the street

207
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.882
* Big apple

208
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:20.251
* People dressed in plastic
bags Directing traffic... *

209
00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:38.178
You're a little too
attached to that soda, Gus.

210
00:14:38.202 --> 00:14:39.537
Love that stuff.

211
00:14:39.603 --> 00:14:41.005
The wife would have my behind

212
00:14:41.072 --> 00:14:43.107
if she busted me
sucking that down.

213
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.309
Why, is she
a Mr. Pibb fan?

214
00:14:45.376 --> 00:14:47.078
You know the deal, Jim.

215
00:14:47.145 --> 00:14:49.280
When we got married, I
converted to Mormonism.

216
00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:52.450
We can't consume anything that
alters our state of mind.

217
00:14:53.717 --> 00:14:56.220
We treat our bodies
with respect.

218
00:14:56.287 --> 00:14:59.023
And I treat mine
like an amusement park.

219
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.325
It's the differences
that make this country great.

220
00:15:01.392 --> 00:15:03.627
Need them cleaned
by the morning, boys.

221
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.874
You were supposed to have
your gear in a half-hour ago.

222
00:15:07.898 --> 00:15:10.434
What, your boy going
to report me to the captain?

223
00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:12.379
Just for thinking you look
good in that mustache.

224
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:15.373
Your mom seems
to like it, though.

225
00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:17.341
So does your sister.

226
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.979
Hey, Sarge.
Welcome back!

227
00:15:22.246 --> 00:15:23.381
Look who's back.

228
00:15:23.447 --> 00:15:25.049
Welcome back, Sarge.

229
00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:27.085
What's up, Hondo?

230
00:15:27.151 --> 00:15:28.552
Hey, Sarge.

231
00:15:33.992 --> 00:15:35.126
Howdy.

232
00:15:35.193 --> 00:15:36.995
What do you need?

233
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.796
Sergeant Hondo?
You're back.

234
00:15:38.862 --> 00:15:40.698
Well, you know
what they say, Gus.

235
00:15:40.764 --> 00:15:41.908
You're either SWAT
or you're not.

236
00:15:41.932 --> 00:15:43.534
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?

237
00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:45.036
Oh, just a tune-up,

238
00:15:45.103 --> 00:15:47.605
but please,
don't touch my sights,

239
00:15:47.671 --> 00:15:48.848
and I made some modifications...

240
00:15:48.872 --> 00:15:50.474
To the trigger too.

241
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:51.575
And you are?

242
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.511
Jim Street.

243
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:54.778
Street.

244
00:15:57.181 --> 00:15:58.916
Yeah, we'll leave them intact.

245
00:15:58.983 --> 00:16:00.351
I need that back by tomorrow.

246
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.786
Can do, Sergeant.

247
00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:04.722
Good to see you.
Good seeing you.

248
00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.528
Gosh, Gus, is that a woody?

249
00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:15.033
Heck, yeah. That's Hondo.
He's old-school SWAT.

250
00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:17.268
The gold standard
of ass-kicking.

251
00:16:17.335 --> 00:16:18.936
Sorry, butt-kicking.

252
00:16:19.003 --> 00:16:20.038
I guess he's back.

253
00:16:21.505 --> 00:16:22.873
I guess he is.

254
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.776
A week-long series,
attacking us top to bottom.

255
00:16:25.843 --> 00:16:27.645
And it's all
SWAT's fault, right?

256
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.548
No, the Chief's been pretty
fair about blaming everyone.

257
00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:33.217
He does want these
bad headlines to end.

258
00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.986
He wants the old warhorses
to help restore the luster.

259
00:16:36.054 --> 00:16:37.155
Old?

260
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:39.123
I know
you ain't talking about me.

261
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.368
You've got to shake off that
three-year rust from Rampart,

262
00:16:41.392 --> 00:16:43.203
because I'm throwing you
in the shit right away.

263
00:16:43.227 --> 00:16:44.828
Sooner the better.

264
00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:47.241
I want you to put together a young,
kick-ass element for me, Dan.

265
00:16:47.265 --> 00:16:49.533
You select them. You train them.
You mold them.

266
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

267
00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:52.412
I know you're not talking
about giving me five pups

268
00:16:52.436 --> 00:16:53.547
fresh out of the gate, are you?

269
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:55.115
Because I didn't
come back to wipe noses.

270
00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.507
Hell, no.

271
00:16:56.574 --> 00:16:59.110
Now, you worked with T.J.
and Boxer at Southwest.

272
00:16:59.177 --> 00:17:00.487
You're up for
supervising them here?

273
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:01.545
That's a start.

274
00:17:01.612 --> 00:17:03.681
Now, all you have to do

275
00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:05.816
is find three fresh ones.

276
00:17:05.883 --> 00:17:08.819
Only catch is Fuller has
to approve the three.

277
00:17:08.886 --> 00:17:11.089
What did Captain Fuller
have to say

278
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.666
when he heard the Chief
was bringing me back?

279
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.258
Hasn't stopped swearing since.

280
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.592
What's your brother's
truck doing outside?

281
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:53.531
We're having a garage
sale I don't know about?

282
00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:58.269
You weren't supposed
to be home for an hour.

283
00:17:58.336 --> 00:17:59.637
Sorry to screw up your getaway.

284
00:18:01.772 --> 00:18:03.774
Look, let's not make
this a thing, okay?

285
00:18:05.509 --> 00:18:07.811
We both knew it was coming.

286
00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.952
It's not like we were in
this to get married, right?

287
00:18:19.923 --> 00:18:21.259
And...

288
00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:24.495
You've changed since...

289
00:18:26.497 --> 00:18:28.399
Well, people change.

290
00:18:29.967 --> 00:18:32.670
Look, when it was good,
it was great, right?

291
00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:36.039
That means something.

292
00:18:45.816 --> 00:18:47.285
Yeah, thanks.

293
00:19:04.168 --> 00:19:06.270
Damn it!
Hey! Hey!

294
00:19:06.337 --> 00:19:08.138
I'm going to throw
this thing out.

295
00:19:08.206 --> 00:19:10.474
You do and you die.

296
00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:13.110
Every SWAT team in the world's
going to have one someday.

297
00:19:13.177 --> 00:19:15.446
It's 50 pounds of scrap metal.

298
00:19:16.647 --> 00:19:19.383
All right.

299
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.785
Say you've got some crazy
suspect barricaded in a house.

300
00:19:21.852 --> 00:19:22.920
All right.

301
00:19:22.986 --> 00:19:25.523
Just chain this
to the back of a truck,

302
00:19:25.589 --> 00:19:28.426
shove this end
right through the wall...

303
00:19:28.492 --> 00:19:31.295
These rods spring out
like fishhooks.

304
00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:34.064
Your partner guns the truck,

305
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.866
takes the whole wall with him.

306
00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:38.502
And we waltz right in and
surprise the bad guy, right?

307
00:19:38.569 --> 00:19:39.970
Correct.

308
00:19:40.037 --> 00:19:41.972
I call it
"The Key to the City."

309
00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:43.073
Patent pending.

310
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.375
Is that right?

311
00:19:44.442 --> 00:19:45.709
Right.

312
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.011
Let me get your M4.

313
00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:50.814
And...

314
00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:56.325
You took the rattle
out of the receiver.

315
00:19:56.687 --> 00:19:57.988
Yeah, new buffer,

316
00:19:58.055 --> 00:20:00.224
new gas rings,
cleaned the gas tube.

317
00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:03.093
I'm surprised
you didn't starch the sling.

318
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.638
If you want me to show you
how to shoot it,

319
00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.430
I'm here all week,
9:00 to 5:00.

320
00:20:08.899 --> 00:20:11.735
Shooters, on the line!
Stand by!

321
00:20:11.802 --> 00:20:12.870
Ready!

322
00:20:36.126 --> 00:20:37.461
Put them on safe and holster.

323
00:20:46.737 --> 00:20:47.938
No roll, Hondo?

324
00:20:48.005 --> 00:20:49.507
How do you know I didn't?

325
00:20:49.573 --> 00:20:51.942
You didn't, did you?

326
00:20:52.009 --> 00:20:54.111
They only roll in John Woo
movies, not real life.

327
00:20:54.177 --> 00:20:55.178
All right.

328
00:20:57.348 --> 00:20:58.449
Here's the winner.

329
00:21:00.017 --> 00:21:02.219
There's a few people
that I would like to thank.

330
00:21:03.487 --> 00:21:05.289
My fellow SWAT officers,
all of you,

331
00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:07.767
thank you for believing in me when
the bosses didn't give me a chance.

332
00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:09.960
Oh. Yeah, that's why
you're the marksman,

333
00:21:10.027 --> 00:21:12.262
and I'm the guy who
tells you who to shoot.

334
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.665
Here you go. I've got you
covered since I let you down.

335
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.007
Tell you what.
I've got a hundred here

336
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.876
that says that guy
can kick your ass.

337
00:21:27.511 --> 00:21:30.047
Are you kidding me, Hondo?
Come on. He's our gun bunny.

338
00:21:30.113 --> 00:21:31.515
Oh, well,
let's make it 200, then.

339
00:21:32.282 --> 00:21:33.617
Sure.

340
00:21:33.684 --> 00:21:36.387
A couple more lap dances
for me tonight.

341
00:21:36.454 --> 00:21:37.521
Want a piece of this?

342
00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:38.656
Yeah.

343
00:21:38.722 --> 00:21:40.057
Don't look so worried.

344
00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:49.266
Yo.

345
00:21:50.668 --> 00:21:51.868
Want to make some extra money?

346
00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:58.476
Hey, don't forget
to take your safety off.

347
00:21:58.542 --> 00:22:00.878
Street, you'd better get
your game face on.

348
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.315
Don't beat him so badly I can't
get a rematch, all right?

349
00:22:05.383 --> 00:22:06.517
I won't make any promises.

350
00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:09.453
It's my money, man.

351
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.021
Shooters,
on the line!

352
00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:12.255
Stand by!

353
00:22:12.322 --> 00:22:13.724
Ready!

354
00:22:34.945 --> 00:22:36.614
Put them on safe!
Holster!

355
00:22:46.457 --> 00:22:47.525
Here's your winner.

356
00:22:48.025 --> 00:22:49.292
Ka-ching!

357
00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:51.328
Yee-haw!

358
00:22:51.395 --> 00:22:54.331
I won, baby.
Thoroughbred.

359
00:23:15.018 --> 00:23:17.821
Yeah, yeah.
Passport, please. Sir?

360
00:23:21.425 --> 00:23:22.526
Next.

361
00:23:25.496 --> 00:23:26.730
Bonjour.

362
00:23:39.777 --> 00:23:41.078
Merci beaucoup.

363
00:23:41.144 --> 00:23:42.312
Next.

364
00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.482
You have anything to declare?

365
00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.850
I don't know how you
got this through De Gaulle.

366
00:23:46.917 --> 00:23:49.319
You can't bring this
through the airport.

367
00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:51.922
Qu'est-ce que c'est la knife
avec la suitcase?

368
00:23:55.092 --> 00:23:57.327
Um, for luck, luck.

369
00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.897
Gift from my father.
Not dangerous.

370
00:23:59.963 --> 00:24:01.198
Mail it home.

371
00:24:01.264 --> 00:24:03.734
Okay.
Mail it home.

372
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:05.302
Okay, okay. Merci.
Okay?

373
00:24:34.698 --> 00:24:36.433
Hey, Gus.
Yeah?

374
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.236
Isn't that eternal damnation
you're chowing down there?

375
00:24:39.302 --> 00:24:41.204
You can't tell Michelle.

376
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:43.231
Isn't she going to smell
the fries on your breath?

377
00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:46.610
That's why God
invented mouthwash.

378
00:24:46.677 --> 00:24:48.579
She'll never know.

379
00:24:48.646 --> 00:24:51.782
Gus, you're cheating on
your wife with fast food.

380
00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:54.117
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

381
00:24:54.184 --> 00:24:56.053
Street, you have
a driver's license?

382
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.355
Got a library card.

383
00:24:58.421 --> 00:24:59.757
It's good enough.

384
00:24:59.823 --> 00:25:01.703
So get your uniform on.
You're driving me today.

385
00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:03.293
Come on.

386
00:25:05.195 --> 00:25:07.598
Did you get
my return ticket and papers?

387
00:25:07.665 --> 00:25:08.985
Flight leaves tonight
at midnight.

388
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.134
No one knows I'm here?

389
00:25:11.201 --> 00:25:12.836
Just me.

390
00:25:12.903 --> 00:25:15.272
Where do you want to go?

391
00:25:15.338 --> 00:25:17.140
It's my uncle's birthday.

392
00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:20.010
I want to surprise him.

393
00:25:31.755 --> 00:25:34.424
If you want me to come by
and mow your lawn later,

394
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:36.059
I'm available, Sergeant.

395
00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:40.097
I'll keep that in mind.
Call me Hondo.

396
00:25:40.163 --> 00:25:43.366
I was a Marine, Did two
years in 'Nam, recon unit.

397
00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:45.703
Spent the next four
teaching combat survival.

398
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:46.870
You serve?

399
00:25:46.937 --> 00:25:47.938
Yeah.

400
00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:50.273
Navy SEALs, right?

401
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.242
That's what my file says.

402
00:25:52.309 --> 00:25:54.211
So what did you do for them?

403
00:25:54.277 --> 00:25:57.280
Besides rescue Marines
when they got lost?

404
00:25:57.347 --> 00:26:00.183
You sniper detail,
amphibious assault, what?

405
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.419
My boat-crew leader
always said

406
00:26:02.485 --> 00:26:05.923
if anyone knew what we did,
we'd failed.

407
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.592
That's fair enough.

408
00:26:08.659 --> 00:26:11.862
So where are we going, Hondo?

409
00:26:11.929 --> 00:26:14.665
What say we go see what the weather's
like over in South Central?

410
00:26:17.434 --> 00:26:18.712
Tell us where your boyfriend is.

411
00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:22.539
Look, I don't speak Spanish!

412
00:26:22.606 --> 00:26:24.574
Tell me where your boyfriend is!

413
00:26:24.642 --> 00:26:26.419
You're not helping him any!

414
00:26:26.443 --> 00:26:28.045
You're not...

415
00:26:29.512 --> 00:26:31.381
Somebody here
going to get locked up.

416
00:26:31.448 --> 00:26:33.550
R-61-15 in foot pursuit.

417
00:26:33.617 --> 00:26:36.386
Suspect headed south,
west of Defiance.

418
00:26:36.453 --> 00:26:38.188
One black male in Lakers purple.

419
00:26:41.591 --> 00:26:42.960
Puerco.
Puerco?

420
00:26:45.495 --> 00:26:47.406
Repeat! One black
male in Lakers purple.

421
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.232
That's our guy talking.
Where's he at?

422
00:26:51.368 --> 00:26:52.836
What the hell you doing,
Navy SEAL?

423
00:27:03.013 --> 00:27:04.453
Oh, hell, yeah!
Get on, baby, get on!

424
00:27:04.514 --> 00:27:06.283
Come on!

425
00:27:06.349 --> 00:27:08.051
Yee...
Haw!

426
00:27:43.053 --> 00:27:44.254
Hey, wait!

427
00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:21.859
Damn, that looked like some Oakland
Raiders Jack Tatum action there.

428
00:28:21.925 --> 00:28:23.269
What you know about Jack Tatum?
Get out of here.

429
00:28:23.293 --> 00:28:24.728
Turn your ass over.

430
00:28:24.795 --> 00:28:26.075
Put your hands behind your back.

431
00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:27.264
Name's Hondo.

432
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.775
I don't give a damn
what your name is.

433
00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.100
I could've caught him on my own.

434
00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:32.169
If you like hard work,
long hours,

435
00:28:32.235 --> 00:28:33.771
and getting dirty for low pay,

436
00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:35.114
I got an opening on my SWAT team.
Ooh, man.

437
00:28:35.138 --> 00:28:36.406
Shut up!

438
00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:40.077
I don't mind that at all.

439
00:28:40.143 --> 00:28:42.012
Pack your bags. You're
coming to SWAT school.

440
00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:43.646
SWAT school?

441
00:28:43.713 --> 00:28:46.750
Shut up! Don't talk
too much. Shut up.

442
00:28:46.817 --> 00:28:48.385
Don't y'all got
nothing better to do

443
00:28:48.451 --> 00:28:50.453
than be hauling another
black man off to jail?

444
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.289
Just perpetuating
the cycle, ain't you?

445
00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:54.801
We'll see how liberal you are
when he's breaking in your place.

446
00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:56.659
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh," my ass.

447
00:29:02.332 --> 00:29:04.201
Sure you don't want
to sit in the back?

448
00:29:04.267 --> 00:29:06.569
I could wear a little cap.

449
00:29:06.636 --> 00:29:08.571
I like the view from up here.

450
00:29:08.638 --> 00:29:10.273
The cap thing is
a nice touch, though.

451
00:29:13.043 --> 00:29:15.879
Officer Burress,
Southwest Division.

452
00:29:24.387 --> 00:29:26.023
So your test scores
are off the chart,

453
00:29:26.089 --> 00:29:27.566
and you've got
all the right references.

454
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.792
Thank you, Sergeant.

455
00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:30.460
Can I get a hot dog
with everything

456
00:29:30.527 --> 00:29:32.029
and a ginger ale, please?
Huh?

457
00:29:32.095 --> 00:29:34.364
Hot dog with everything
and ginger ale. Street?

458
00:29:34.431 --> 00:29:35.532
Same.

459
00:29:35.598 --> 00:29:37.367
Well, I will have
a soy dog, please,

460
00:29:37.434 --> 00:29:40.637
on a whole-wheat bun,
plain, and a...

461
00:29:40.703 --> 00:29:42.239
A tomato juice,
if you've got it.

462
00:29:42.806 --> 00:29:44.341
Thank you.

463
00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:45.575
I'm a vegetarian.

464
00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:48.511
I'm a bit curious. Um...

465
00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:49.980
You've been a cop six years,

466
00:29:50.047 --> 00:29:52.182
and you've never had a civilian
complaint against you?

467
00:29:52.249 --> 00:29:53.984
Well, I try to be courteous
and professional

468
00:29:54.051 --> 00:29:55.853
with everyone I encounter.

469
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:58.021
Well, the thing is, Dave...

470
00:29:59.356 --> 00:30:00.924
David.

471
00:30:00.991 --> 00:30:04.661
Right, David.
Um, here's the thing.

472
00:30:04.727 --> 00:30:06.529
There may come a time in SWAT

473
00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:08.674
when you've got to get a little
dirty behind a street bust.

474
00:30:08.698 --> 00:30:10.233
Do you know what I'm saying?

475
00:30:11.001 --> 00:30:12.035
No.

476
00:30:16.673 --> 00:30:18.175
How the hell can I trust a man

477
00:30:18.241 --> 00:30:20.610
who won't eat a good
old-fashioned American hot dog?

478
00:30:21.578 --> 00:30:22.980
And he's a vegetarian.

479
00:30:25.849 --> 00:30:27.489
I'm looking for
an injured officer.

480
00:30:27.517 --> 00:30:29.352
Name is Sanchez, Chris Sanchez.

481
00:30:31.021 --> 00:30:32.189
Room five, in the corner.

482
00:30:32.255 --> 00:30:34.224
Thank you.

483
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:35.725
Hey, what do you need, Sarge?

484
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.360
You're Sanchez's partner?

485
00:30:37.427 --> 00:30:38.996
Mmm-hmm.

486
00:30:39.062 --> 00:30:40.397
Sanchez do that?

487
00:30:41.264 --> 00:30:42.866
Mmm-hmm.

488
00:30:42.933 --> 00:30:44.734
You help?
No, Sarge.

489
00:30:46.103 --> 00:30:47.837
Reminds me of my third divorce.

490
00:30:49.072 --> 00:30:50.207
Bad day, huh?

491
00:30:50.273 --> 00:30:51.875
Kiss my ass, ese.

492
00:30:53.343 --> 00:30:55.578
I'm starting to like
this Sanchez already.

493
00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:57.214
He spent four years in Metro,

494
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.116
passed the SWAT quals
three times,

495
00:30:59.182 --> 00:31:00.951
been rejected by Fuller
three times.

496
00:31:01.018 --> 00:31:02.485
Might be a reason.

497
00:31:02.552 --> 00:31:03.829
He's got a couple of beefs here.

498
00:31:03.853 --> 00:31:05.855
Hmm.

499
00:31:05.923 --> 00:31:08.134
I'm going to get the nurse
to clean and dress your wound.

500
00:31:08.158 --> 00:31:09.626
Sorry, wrong room.

501
00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:12.262
Who you looking for?

502
00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:13.830
Chris Sanchez.

503
00:31:15.232 --> 00:31:16.900
I'm Chris Sanchez.

504
00:31:16.967 --> 00:31:19.136
You're Chris Sanchez?

505
00:31:19.202 --> 00:31:21.038
Look, if you're
Internal Affairs,

506
00:31:21.104 --> 00:31:24.074
that guy had double-edged
razor blades in his mouth.

507
00:31:24.141 --> 00:31:26.043
I had to put him down hard.

508
00:31:26.109 --> 00:31:27.978
I'm sick and tired
of these bullshit complaints

509
00:31:28.045 --> 00:31:30.480
because some vato doesn't like
getting thrown to the pavement

510
00:31:30.547 --> 00:31:32.215
by a woman.

511
00:31:32.282 --> 00:31:33.883
I look like
I.A.D. to you?

512
00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:37.687
Who are you?

513
00:31:37.754 --> 00:31:40.657
Wait, now, that guy had
about 100 pounds on you.

514
00:31:40.723 --> 00:31:41.992
All brawn, no brains.

515
00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:43.426
You didn't answer my question.

516
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.166
So you still want to work SWAT?

517
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:55.472
No, I just enjoy applying
all the time.

518
00:31:56.339 --> 00:31:58.308
Gas it up.
Return it.

519
00:32:01.411 --> 00:32:03.846
Am I looking at another
day of chauffeur duty?

520
00:32:03.913 --> 00:32:05.048
Team's almost filled.

521
00:32:05.115 --> 00:32:07.684
Not that it hasn't been fun.

522
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.120
Well, I do have one more spot.

523
00:32:10.187 --> 00:32:12.755
Can you think of anybody
I might have overlooked?

524
00:32:12.822 --> 00:32:14.824
Is this a game
or a test, Sergeant?

525
00:32:16.793 --> 00:32:18.261
Could be a bit of both.

526
00:32:18.328 --> 00:32:20.063
Yeah, I'm a little
old for games.

527
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.765
All right.

528
00:32:22.832 --> 00:32:24.501
So how'd you like
to be back on SWAT?

529
00:32:27.837 --> 00:32:28.938
It's not going to happen.

530
00:32:29.006 --> 00:32:30.449
So why you hanging
around the cage, then?

531
00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:33.243
It's a job.

532
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.777
And SWAT's a calling.

533
00:32:36.046 --> 00:32:37.547
Anybody around you
for five minutes

534
00:32:37.614 --> 00:32:39.816
can tell you've still
got the bug.

535
00:32:39.882 --> 00:32:41.584
All you've got to do is say yes.

536
00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:47.957
It's not up to me or you.
I've got a history here.

537
00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:50.994
Yeah, let's talk about that.

538
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:56.299
I heard some rumors about
you and your old partner.

539
00:32:56.366 --> 00:32:59.469
Did you give him up
in Fuller's office?

540
00:32:59.536 --> 00:33:01.904
Because, you know, team members
got to trust each other.

541
00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:03.740
Okay.

542
00:33:04.907 --> 00:33:06.543
I'm not on your team...

543
00:33:09.746 --> 00:33:12.515
And no, I didn't give him up.

544
00:33:14.684 --> 00:33:16.153
You've been in that cage
six months,

545
00:33:16.219 --> 00:33:18.021
shining boots
and fixing weapons,

546
00:33:18.088 --> 00:33:19.956
waiting for a second chance.

547
00:33:20.023 --> 00:33:21.424
I've got one,

548
00:33:21.491 --> 00:33:23.393
and I'm offering it to you.

549
00:33:26.163 --> 00:33:28.065
Fuller will never
sign off on it.

550
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:31.201
You let me deal with that
paper-pushing punk.

551
00:33:31.268 --> 00:33:33.136
I want you on my team.

552
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:40.643
Let me tell you.
It's the sauce.

553
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.245
If you don't have
the right sauce,

554
00:33:42.312 --> 00:33:43.646
what do you got?
You know?

555
00:33:43.713 --> 00:33:45.415
Now, my mother,
she used to make sauce.

556
00:33:45.482 --> 00:33:46.916
Now you go into the store,

557
00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:48.851
and you buy it
in a jar or in a can...

558
00:33:48.918 --> 00:33:49.919
Oh!

559
00:33:51.421 --> 00:33:52.555
Alex?

560
00:33:52.622 --> 00:33:54.023
Alex!

561
00:33:54.091 --> 00:33:56.293
Nobody told me you were coming.
When did you get here?

562
00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:57.527
Surprise.

563
00:33:58.661 --> 00:33:59.896
Happy birthday, Uncle.

564
00:33:59.962 --> 00:34:01.664
Come on, sit down.

565
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:03.533
Sit. Bring some
champagne, huh?

566
00:34:04.301 --> 00:34:06.069
Sit, eat.

567
00:34:06.136 --> 00:34:08.205
The chief's making me
take you back.

568
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:10.871
He's concerned about losing all his
best officers to other cities.

569
00:34:10.907 --> 00:34:12.427
He thinks I'm one of
his best officers?

570
00:34:12.475 --> 00:34:15.212
But he's given me
complete oversight,

571
00:34:15.278 --> 00:34:17.680
and trust me, you've got
no room for error.

572
00:34:17.747 --> 00:34:22.985
So I will give you
Boxer, T.J. McCabe,

573
00:34:23.052 --> 00:34:27.157
and this new guy, Deacon Kaye.

574
00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:30.069
I'm going to have to pass
the other two.

575
00:34:30.093 --> 00:34:32.162
Sanchez is a woman,
and Street...

576
00:34:32.229 --> 00:34:33.830
Well, Street's on my shit list.

577
00:34:33.896 --> 00:34:36.833
Hey, I'm on your shit list
too, and I'm the team leader.

578
00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:39.836
You work for me now,
and it's my team to choose.

579
00:34:39.902 --> 00:34:42.004
With all due respect, Captain,

580
00:34:42.071 --> 00:34:44.040
other leaders
get to pick their teams.

581
00:34:44.107 --> 00:34:47.577
And you can too.
Just pick two new people.

582
00:34:47.644 --> 00:34:49.312
Look.

583
00:34:50.313 --> 00:34:52.649
Just give me the team I ask for.

584
00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:55.152
You can even call it
your "shit list team."

585
00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:56.819
That way,
if anything goes wrong,

586
00:34:56.886 --> 00:34:58.921
you can put all the blame on me.

587
00:34:58.988 --> 00:35:00.757
It'd be just like old times.

588
00:35:05.828 --> 00:35:09.432
Okay. Okay,
you've got your team,

589
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.037
but when you fail, and
you probably will fail,

590
00:35:15.104 --> 00:35:16.249
Sanchez goes back to traffic,

591
00:35:16.273 --> 00:35:18.675
and you and your boy
Street are plain gone.

592
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:21.344
No, not just off SWAT,

593
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:24.447
off the force.
You feel me?

594
00:35:25.515 --> 00:35:28.017
Oh, yeah, I feel you.

595
00:35:32.289 --> 00:35:33.490
Okay, I'm leaving now.

596
00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:35.658
No, don't go.

597
00:35:35.725 --> 00:35:38.528
I have wine and cognac
from home. Come on.

598
00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:40.263
I must go.
I have a flight to catch.

599
00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.165
Oh, catch another flight.

600
00:35:42.232 --> 00:35:44.000
Let me introduce you to Monica.

601
00:35:50.507 --> 00:35:52.342
You like this knife?

602
00:35:53.576 --> 00:35:56.379
This is my father's knife.
He gave it to me.

603
00:35:59.249 --> 00:36:02.285
It's a beautiful knife,
and she's a beautiful woman.

604
00:36:02.352 --> 00:36:04.254
Now, why don't you stay,
have a good time,

605
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:05.788
and go back tomorrow?

606
00:36:05.855 --> 00:36:09.292
Listen, I'm running
the business now.

607
00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:10.993
I'm the new boss.

608
00:36:13.696 --> 00:36:15.632
Don't joke with me, Alex,

609
00:36:15.698 --> 00:36:18.701
and don't ever forget, your
father's running the business.

610
00:36:20.303 --> 00:36:21.971
No, I retired him.

611
00:36:22.939 --> 00:36:25.107
He never spoke of that to me.

612
00:36:26.276 --> 00:36:28.478
That's because
he can't speak anymore.

613
00:36:38.054 --> 00:36:39.822
You put your hand
in my father's pocket...

614
00:36:42.692 --> 00:36:44.160
Not in mine.

615
00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:50.300
If you take my money,
I'll take your life.

616
00:36:50.367 --> 00:36:51.568
Understood?

617
00:36:52.302 --> 00:36:53.470
Pas de probleme.

618
00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:04.180
Mail it to me.

619
00:37:19.529 --> 00:37:21.063
* Nothing ever stops
all these thoughts

620
00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.765
* And the pain attached to them

621
00:37:22.832 --> 00:37:25.234
* Sometimes I wonder
why this is happening

622
00:37:25.302 --> 00:37:27.236
* It's like nothing I can do
will distract me

623
00:37:27.304 --> 00:37:28.671
* When I think of how

624
00:37:28.738 --> 00:37:30.139
* I shot myself
in the back again

625
00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:33.643
* It never goes away
It never goes away

626
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:34.911
* And now

627
00:37:34.977 --> 00:37:37.647
* You've become a part of me

628
00:37:37.714 --> 00:37:39.816
* You'll always be right here

629
00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:42.184
* You've become a part of me

630
00:37:43.486 --> 00:37:44.721
* You'll always be my fear

631
00:37:44.787 --> 00:37:47.256
* I can't separate

632
00:37:47.324 --> 00:37:49.626
* Myself from what I've done

633
00:37:49.692 --> 00:37:52.362
* Giving up a part of me

634
00:37:52.429 --> 00:37:55.498
* I've let myself become you

635
00:37:55.565 --> 00:37:57.767
* You, you

636
00:37:57.834 --> 00:37:59.135
Good evening.

637
00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:00.841
Sir, may I see your
license, registration,

638
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.004
and proof of insurance?

639
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.308
I'm a tourist, you know,
I'm visiting the U.S.

640
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:07.444
I have my passport if you want.

641
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.778
Let me see it.

642
00:38:10.813 --> 00:38:12.482
Whose car is this?

643
00:38:12.549 --> 00:38:14.684
It belongs to
my uncle. Why?

644
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:17.420
You've got a left taillight out.

645
00:38:22.959 --> 00:38:24.327
Hi. This is
Bridget the Midget,

646
00:38:24.394 --> 00:38:26.195
and we're out here
in front of the Key Club

647
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:28.698
on Sunset
in beautiful Hollywood.

648
00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:31.167
I just wonder how it is
you can get inside of there.

649
00:38:31.233 --> 00:38:32.935
Anyways,
we're on Sunset Boulevard,

650
00:38:33.002 --> 00:38:35.972
where anything could happen,
especially police harassment.

651
00:38:36.038 --> 00:38:38.475
Hey, you guys, you're all pigs!

652
00:38:42.044 --> 00:38:44.046
Is your uncle's name
Martin Gascoigne?

653
00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:45.582
Yeah, so we're okay?

654
00:38:45.648 --> 00:38:47.517
There's an arrest warrant
in that name,

655
00:38:47.584 --> 00:38:50.252
and I have to detain you until
we can verify who you are.

656
00:38:50.319 --> 00:38:52.755
Sir, please step out
of the vehicle.

657
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.076
You're here awful early.

658
00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:15.912
Traffic was lighter than usual.

659
00:39:15.978 --> 00:39:17.747
Streets must've been
damn near empty.

660
00:39:24.053 --> 00:39:25.722
Ali's his sister.

661
00:39:25.788 --> 00:39:27.557
And I called bottoms
on the last one I won.

662
00:39:27.624 --> 00:39:30.126
Now, you called bottoms, but
that's not what you got.

663
00:39:30.192 --> 00:39:31.872
Yo, dawg, what's up?
What's happening, man?

664
00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:33.730
Jim.

665
00:39:34.263 --> 00:39:35.432
Boxer.

666
00:39:38.234 --> 00:39:41.771
So, what did you do
to my sister?

667
00:39:41.838 --> 00:39:43.172
Nothing.

668
00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:44.874
That's not what I heard.

669
00:39:44.941 --> 00:39:47.376
I mean, that's not the
word on the street.

670
00:39:47.444 --> 00:39:50.379
She's... She's all
broken up over you.

671
00:39:51.481 --> 00:39:54.183
Don't know why.
She left me.

672
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.219
Dumped. A case of the crabs
will do that to a woman.

673
00:39:57.286 --> 00:39:59.689
Is there something about
this team I need to know?

674
00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:01.758
What I want to know is
what an asshole like you

675
00:40:01.824 --> 00:40:04.026
did to my little sister
to make her leave.

676
00:40:05.161 --> 00:40:08.097
She's 28, all right?

677
00:40:08.164 --> 00:40:11.100
And trust me,
she's not so little.

678
00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:12.435
Trust you?
Ooh, no, you didn't.

679
00:40:12.502 --> 00:40:13.870
How's your last partner doing?

680
00:40:13.936 --> 00:40:15.938
Gamble.
He trust you too?

681
00:40:17.306 --> 00:40:18.417
Hey, you want to talk
about this now?

682
00:40:18.441 --> 00:40:19.552
You're going to
tell me about it?

683
00:40:19.576 --> 00:40:20.719
Street, Street, Street, Street.

684
00:40:20.743 --> 00:40:22.579
Hey, Street!

685
00:40:22.645 --> 00:40:24.246
You want to talk about it?

686
00:40:27.116 --> 00:40:28.585
Come here, come here.

687
00:40:28.651 --> 00:40:30.419
Don't talk about
what you don't...

688
00:40:30.487 --> 00:40:32.097
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Street!

689
00:40:32.121 --> 00:40:33.690
It's not worth it.

690
00:40:33.756 --> 00:40:35.458
Who else you going to narc on?

691
00:40:35.525 --> 00:40:37.059
Who are you?

692
00:40:38.194 --> 00:40:39.996
Who the hell are you?

693
00:40:44.133 --> 00:40:47.670
I guess you're not the prettiest
one here anymore, huh, T.J.?

694
00:40:47.737 --> 00:40:50.607
Well, sounds like you've
all gotten acquainted.

695
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.543
Let's get started.

696
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.377
I'll make this simple.

697
00:40:55.444 --> 00:40:58.214
LAPD SWAT is the most
honored, most respected,

698
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.484
and most professional police
division in the world.

699
00:41:12.128 --> 00:41:14.030
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

700
00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.865
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

701
00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:21.037
* You jump
in front of my car when you

702
00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:23.405
* You know all the time that

703
00:41:23.472 --> 00:41:27.409
* Ninety miles an hour, girl,
is the speed I drive

704
00:41:27.476 --> 00:41:29.445
* You tell me it's all right

705
00:41:29.512 --> 00:41:31.380
* You don't mind a little pain

706
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:33.482
Police! Police!

707
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.785
* Take you for a drive

708
00:41:35.852 --> 00:41:37.554
* I'm not the only soul

709
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.889
* Who's accused of hit and run

710
00:41:40.923 --> 00:41:42.191
That ain't going to get it.

711
00:41:42.258 --> 00:41:43.760
* I can see you had your fun

712
00:41:43.826 --> 00:41:45.728
* But, darlin', can't you see

713
00:41:45.795 --> 00:41:48.531
* My signals turn
from green to red

714
00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:50.933
Bang.

715
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.035
Sanchez.

716
00:41:53.102 --> 00:41:55.938
* You're just like
* Crosstown traffic

717
00:41:56.005 --> 00:41:58.708
* So hard to get through to you

718
00:41:58.775 --> 00:42:02.745
* Crosstown traffic * I
don't need to run over you

719
00:42:02.812 --> 00:42:06.983
* Crosstown traffic * All
you do is slow me down

720
00:42:07.049 --> 00:42:08.894
* And I got better things
on the other side of town

721
00:42:08.918 --> 00:42:10.086
Money.

722
00:42:19.228 --> 00:42:21.397
* Yeah, yeah Crosstown traffic *

723
00:42:23.432 --> 00:42:26.135
Oh, oh, man.

724
00:42:27.203 --> 00:42:28.805
Ooh!
That sucked.

725
00:42:28.871 --> 00:42:30.406
What's up, Sanchez?

726
00:42:32.108 --> 00:42:33.351
When you're done
with that one,

727
00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:35.144
I've got another one for you.

728
00:42:40.717 --> 00:42:43.552
T.J.'s sitting on two pair,
looking for the boat.

729
00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:47.757
Got it.

730
00:42:47.824 --> 00:42:50.126
Street, you've got three aces.

731
00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:51.761
Need one
to take T.J. out.

732
00:42:53.696 --> 00:42:56.265
Winner, winner, winner!

733
00:42:56.332 --> 00:42:58.467
All right, Deke. Let's
see what you've got.

734
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.171
10 of spades.

735
00:43:02.238 --> 00:43:04.774
Spade flush.
Not good enough.

736
00:43:04.841 --> 00:43:07.276
Hondo, isn't that
a straight flush?

737
00:43:08.577 --> 00:43:10.379
Hold the phone.

738
00:43:10.446 --> 00:43:13.249
Six, seven, eight, nine,

739
00:43:13.315 --> 00:43:15.618
10 of spades!
Straight flush.

740
00:43:16.352 --> 00:43:17.720
Deke!

741
00:43:17.787 --> 00:43:19.756
Beats four aces
in Compton any day.

742
00:43:19.822 --> 00:43:21.624
I think it works
in Orange County too.

743
00:43:21.691 --> 00:43:24.093
Sure you're right.
Good work, guys.

744
00:43:33.703 --> 00:43:35.371
Police! Police!

745
00:43:40.276 --> 00:43:42.178
Clear?
Clear.

746
00:43:42.244 --> 00:43:43.746
Clear. Let's go.

747
00:43:51.387 --> 00:43:52.789
That's right.

748
00:43:52.855 --> 00:43:57.593
SWAT is a life-saving organization,
not a life-taking one.

749
00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.831
That's why the FBI and Secret
Service come here to train with us.

750
00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:05.802
Smooth, Deke.

751
00:44:05.868 --> 00:44:07.870
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

752
00:44:07.937 --> 00:44:10.673
I guess if I was deaf, I
wouldn't know you were here,

753
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.610
but while you're laughing, there's
lots of people that want us to fail.

754
00:44:14.677 --> 00:44:15.912
Get it right.

755
00:44:26.655 --> 00:44:27.824
Clear.
Clear.

756
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.025
Clear.

757
00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:37.199
Suspect, put your hands on your
head and come out. Come out!

758
00:44:37.266 --> 00:44:38.267
Come out!

759
00:44:38.334 --> 00:44:39.368
Come out now!

760
00:44:39.435 --> 00:44:40.436
Turn around.

761
00:44:40.502 --> 00:44:42.071
Down!
Down, get down.

762
00:44:42.138 --> 00:44:43.272
Down.

763
00:44:43.339 --> 00:44:46.075
Yeah. Outstanding, guys.

764
00:44:46.743 --> 00:44:48.978
Huh? Huh?

765
00:44:49.045 --> 00:44:50.146
You feel that?

766
00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.822
The team's going out
for beers later.

767
00:44:59.889 --> 00:45:01.223
I'm buying.

768
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.993
I'll take mine after we pass.

769
00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.263
Well, Fuller's definitely
going to try and hose us.

770
00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:09.331
Good. I'd hate
to break a sweat

771
00:45:09.398 --> 00:45:10.800
just for a first-round
knockout.

772
00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:15.004
Hey, we've got a big day
tomorrow. Save some.

773
00:45:15.071 --> 00:45:17.774
I've got plenty.

774
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.209
I'm depending on you to get
these guys through this.

775
00:45:22.144 --> 00:45:23.946
I'll cover my end.

776
00:45:25.547 --> 00:45:26.916
Can I ask you something?

777
00:45:26.983 --> 00:45:28.284
Yeah, go for it.

778
00:45:29.351 --> 00:45:30.686
Why'd you pick me?

779
00:45:34.156 --> 00:45:35.691
To piss off the captain.

780
00:46:02.584 --> 00:46:04.453
All right,
here's the scenario.

781
00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.389
There are six hijackers armed
with handguns and knives

782
00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:09.358
in control of that plane.

783
00:46:09.425 --> 00:46:10.735
They've already
killed one hostage

784
00:46:10.759 --> 00:46:12.494
and are threatening
to kill the others

785
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.931
unless they get a pilot
and fuel within the hour.

786
00:46:14.997 --> 00:46:17.233
There'll be SWAT officers
disguised as hostages.

787
00:46:17.299 --> 00:46:20.336
Other SWAT officers will be
playing the roles of terrorists,

788
00:46:20.402 --> 00:46:23.172
and they will be
trying to kill you.

789
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:25.207
Staff sergeants
will be grading us.

790
00:46:25.274 --> 00:46:26.584
Couldn't give us
the bus, huh, Hondo?

791
00:46:26.608 --> 00:46:28.277
They always give us
the goddamn bus.

792
00:46:28.344 --> 00:46:30.022
It sounds like Fuller's
really got it in for us.

793
00:46:30.046 --> 00:46:31.380
You think?

794
00:46:31.447 --> 00:46:32.714
Another thing.

795
00:46:32.781 --> 00:46:34.416
There are two
dynamic entry points.

796
00:46:34.483 --> 00:46:37.053
One here beneath
the front landing gear,

797
00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:39.721
one back here by the
baggage compartment.

798
00:46:39.788 --> 00:46:43.359
I'm sure Fuller's got surprises
at both those entrances.

799
00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:45.995
We get bogged down
anywhere, we fail.

800
00:46:46.628 --> 00:46:48.397
Any ideas?

801
00:46:48.464 --> 00:46:50.066
There's another way in, Hondo.

802
00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:52.845
There's an elevator shaft here

803
00:46:52.869 --> 00:46:54.837
where they bring in
the service carts,

804
00:46:54.904 --> 00:46:58.107
and there's a mechanic's
access right here.

805
00:46:58.174 --> 00:46:59.808
Man, that's going
to be tight as hell.

806
00:46:59.876 --> 00:47:02.244
Yeah. How many men
can we fit in there?

807
00:47:02.311 --> 00:47:04.646
Men? None.

808
00:47:09.919 --> 00:47:12.855
All right.
Work this out.

809
00:47:12.922 --> 00:47:14.623
Get in there and
break Fuller's heart.

810
00:47:17.026 --> 00:47:18.694
Okay.
What do we got?

811
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.896
Toy guns.

812
00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:21.297
Toy guns, sir, toy guns.

813
00:47:21.363 --> 00:47:23.065
Let's do this.
All right.

814
00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:24.972
Shame you're not playing
one of the terrorists.

815
00:47:37.213 --> 00:47:38.814
I'm supposed to
be in first class.

816
00:47:38.881 --> 00:47:40.782
We've got
camera three going up?

817
00:47:42.684 --> 00:47:44.353
Three is set.

818
00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.755
Checked it on the monitor.

819
00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:48.490
Are you ready?
Oh, yeah.

820
00:47:50.092 --> 00:47:51.372
Okay, let's see
what they've got.

821
00:47:51.427 --> 00:47:52.561
Ready on three.

822
00:48:20.189 --> 00:48:21.958
* Gather 'round

823
00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:26.128
* Love, baby, yeah

824
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:29.531
* Gather 'round, come on

825
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:34.070
* Love, baby, yeah

826
00:48:34.136 --> 00:48:37.206
* Listen up,
we got a lot to learn

827
00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:44.813
* Yeah

828
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.284
* Number one Time is running out

829
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.753
* Number two Time is running out

830
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.224
* Number three
Time is running out

831
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:58.727
* Number four
Let it all hang out

832
00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.808
* Check it out

833
00:49:12.874 --> 00:49:14.443
* Stay cool

834
00:49:16.178 --> 00:49:17.413
* Stay fly

835
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.781
* Yeah

836
00:49:19.848 --> 00:49:23.052
* Number one Time is running out

837
00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:26.522
* Number two Time is running out

838
00:49:26.588 --> 00:49:29.992
* Number three
Time is running out

839
00:49:30.059 --> 00:49:33.462
* Number four
Time is running out *

840
00:49:35.264 --> 00:49:37.066
How did you know
about this place?

841
00:49:37.133 --> 00:49:38.600
I've known a few stewardesses.

842
00:49:39.201 --> 00:49:40.636
Just a few?

843
00:50:19.675 --> 00:50:21.277
Stand by.
We've got a device.

844
00:50:21.343 --> 00:50:22.478
Same here.

845
00:50:54.176 --> 00:50:55.244
Disarmed.

846
00:50:57.846 --> 00:50:58.914
Set?

847
00:51:10.526 --> 00:51:11.660
Here we go.

848
00:51:12.394 --> 00:51:13.562
Three,

849
00:51:14.296 --> 00:51:15.364
two,

850
00:51:15.897 --> 00:51:16.965
one.

851
00:51:20.469 --> 00:51:21.503
Boxer, one down.

852
00:51:33.615 --> 00:51:34.883
Down!

853
00:51:37.319 --> 00:51:38.420
Damn.

854
00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:44.126
Deke?
I got one down.

855
00:51:44.193 --> 00:51:45.894
McCabe?
I got one.

856
00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:47.296
Sanchez, one down.

857
00:51:47.363 --> 00:51:48.830
That's five.

858
00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:50.232
There's one more, guys.

859
00:51:50.299 --> 00:51:51.700
There's a sleeper.
Come on.

860
00:51:57.539 --> 00:51:58.640
Come on.

861
00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:07.649
That'll be six.

862
00:52:07.716 --> 00:52:09.751
Clear?
Clear.

863
00:52:09.818 --> 00:52:11.387
Clear.
Clear.

864
00:52:11.453 --> 00:52:15.724
10-David, this is 70-David.
We are Code 4, all clear.

865
00:52:15.791 --> 00:52:17.759
Oh, yeah.

866
00:52:17.826 --> 00:52:20.496
Wow. Is that
a new course record?

867
00:52:28.204 --> 00:52:29.338
Yeah.
All right.

868
00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:31.973
Good job, guys.

869
00:52:34.576 --> 00:52:35.677
Damn.

870
00:52:46.255 --> 00:52:48.224
Please, please, Pop.

871
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.626
Yo, Sanchez.
I'm in SWAT now.

872
00:52:50.692 --> 00:52:52.394
Yo, Deke.

873
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:54.696
Deke, is that you, man?

874
00:52:54.763 --> 00:52:55.831
Oh, my God, Deke.

875
00:52:55.897 --> 00:52:56.898
Tell me that ain't you.

876
00:52:56.965 --> 00:52:58.243
You were a serious
butterball, bro.

877
00:52:58.267 --> 00:53:00.602
That's all in the past.

878
00:53:00.669 --> 00:53:02.804
I ate here every day,
worked here every summer.

879
00:53:02.871 --> 00:53:05.040
I ended up looking
like Fat Albert.

880
00:53:05.106 --> 00:53:08.009
I'm cool. Eating right
has me looking like this.

881
00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:10.979
Man, put that away.

882
00:53:11.046 --> 00:53:13.815
Hey, put that away.

883
00:53:13.882 --> 00:53:15.617
Put another in for me.

884
00:53:15.684 --> 00:53:18.254
Hey, yeah, break out your money.

885
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.488
Give me that change.

886
00:53:19.555 --> 00:53:21.957
Ooh, whoa-oh, hey.

887
00:53:22.023 --> 00:53:24.159
Ah, so you're celebrating
without me, huh?

888
00:53:24.226 --> 00:53:25.527
Mr. Kaye,
you are the master.

889
00:53:25.594 --> 00:53:27.138
Like son,
like father, right, Dad?

890
00:53:27.162 --> 00:53:29.298
That was one kick-ass
display today.

891
00:53:29.365 --> 00:53:30.708
That's what
I'm talking about.

892
00:53:30.732 --> 00:53:33.302
All right, but let's
remember one thing.

893
00:53:33.369 --> 00:53:35.837
If that was a real
operation and not a test,

894
00:53:35.904 --> 00:53:37.673
one of us would be
calling T.J.'s family,

895
00:53:37.739 --> 00:53:40.175
trying to explain
what went wrong today.

896
00:53:42.644 --> 00:53:46.081
One casualty may be acceptable
by department standards,

897
00:53:46.147 --> 00:53:48.149
never acceptable by mine.

898
00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:49.651
We're clear on that?

899
00:53:49.718 --> 00:53:51.520
Got you.

900
00:53:51.587 --> 00:53:53.088
Yes, sir.
Crystal.

901
00:53:53.154 --> 00:53:55.691
All right. Well, let's
continue celebrating tonight,

902
00:53:55.757 --> 00:53:57.826
but tomorrow, we're SWAT.

903
00:53:57.893 --> 00:53:59.227
Nice.

904
00:54:06.435 --> 00:54:08.370
I love you too.

905
00:54:08.437 --> 00:54:11.106
Homeland security, my ass.
They can't keep me like this.

906
00:54:11.172 --> 00:54:13.942
I've been patient,
day after day,

907
00:54:15.311 --> 00:54:17.112
so tell me, what's going on?

908
00:54:17.178 --> 00:54:18.714
This is the problem.

909
00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.949
Your prints
do not match your ID,

910
00:54:21.016 --> 00:54:23.856
so they're running another check right
now through the FBI and Interpol.

911
00:54:23.919 --> 00:54:25.854
Interpol, shit.
Get me out of here.

912
00:54:25.921 --> 00:54:27.289
I'm doing everything I can.

913
00:54:27.356 --> 00:54:30.659
Do more. This is easy.
Who do we have to pay?

914
00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:33.161
You can't solve this problem
by throwing money at it.

915
00:54:33.228 --> 00:54:36.097
Then who do we have to kill?

916
00:54:36.164 --> 00:54:39.167
Come on,
guys, it's only 11:00.

917
00:54:39.234 --> 00:54:42.504
I got a babysitter for the
first time in three months.

918
00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:44.072
We've been up
since 4:00.

919
00:54:44.139 --> 00:54:45.341
That's weak.

920
00:54:45.407 --> 00:54:48.143
If I get home by midnight,
I might get me some.

921
00:54:48.209 --> 00:54:49.678
T.J.?

922
00:54:49.745 --> 00:54:51.323
I get home before midnight,
I'm finding some.

923
00:54:51.347 --> 00:54:53.382
Sorry, babe.

924
00:54:53.449 --> 00:54:55.351
Boxer? Hey, I know I'm
not getting some.

925
00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:57.853
If I don't get home soon,
my wife's gonna freak.

926
00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:00.856
You guys suck.

927
00:55:02.223 --> 00:55:04.926
You know how hard it is
to find a babysitter?

928
00:55:11.299 --> 00:55:12.734
Yo, Street.

929
00:55:13.502 --> 00:55:14.970
Did you pass?

930
00:55:15.537 --> 00:55:16.738
Yeah.

931
00:55:16.805 --> 00:55:19.140
Awesome. This first
round's on the house.

932
00:55:19.207 --> 00:55:21.176
Thanks, darling.

933
00:55:21.242 --> 00:55:23.379
Anything but tequila, please.

934
00:55:23.445 --> 00:55:24.513
No?

935
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.614
No.

936
00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:30.586
We did good today, huh?

937
00:55:31.086 --> 00:55:32.454
Yeah.

938
00:55:34.089 --> 00:55:35.557
What's it like,

939
00:55:36.592 --> 00:55:37.659
the real thing?

940
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.429
It's faster.

941
00:55:40.496 --> 00:55:42.297
It's a lot faster.

942
00:55:49.738 --> 00:55:51.239
You know that guy?

943
00:55:52.207 --> 00:55:54.476
Used to.
Aw, fuck.

944
00:55:56.244 --> 00:55:57.779
Bye.

945
00:55:59.214 --> 00:56:00.449
See you.

946
00:56:01.717 --> 00:56:03.485
It's all yours, man.

947
00:56:08.824 --> 00:56:10.058
Hey.

948
00:56:11.927 --> 00:56:14.062
How you doing?
Oh, man, I am good.

949
00:56:14.963 --> 00:56:16.197
Heard they took you back.

950
00:56:16.264 --> 00:56:17.633
Yeah.

951
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:20.636
This your girlfriend?

952
00:56:20.702 --> 00:56:22.771
No. No, she's SWAT.

953
00:56:23.705 --> 00:56:25.707
She wha... She's...

954
00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:33.048
What... This... This is
what it's come down to?

955
00:56:33.114 --> 00:56:34.282
Busting down doors
with J.Lo?

956
00:56:36.752 --> 00:56:39.287
You know, I didn't know that
they made bulletproof bras.

957
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:42.123
Is it just me, but you
know, I didn't know that.

958
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.292
What they need to make
are bulletproof condoms

959
00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:46.094
big enough to fit your big head.

960
00:56:47.295 --> 00:56:48.564
Oh.

961
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:50.832
Oh, nice.
Good, I like it.

962
00:56:52.067 --> 00:56:54.002
This your girlfriend? Cute.

963
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:55.737
No, but you can be my bitch.

964
00:56:57.272 --> 00:56:58.574
Really?

965
00:57:04.379 --> 00:57:06.882
No, man, leave it alone.

966
00:57:06.948 --> 00:57:08.388
Here we go.
Leave it alone.

967
00:57:08.416 --> 00:57:10.652
Hey, how are you?

968
00:57:10.719 --> 00:57:12.087
I'm good.

969
00:57:12.921 --> 00:57:14.089
Put it on my tab?

970
00:57:14.155 --> 00:57:15.491
Mmm-hmm.

971
00:57:17.959 --> 00:57:21.129
Hey, glad to see all that
butt-kissing's really paid off.

972
00:57:22.197 --> 00:57:24.065
Say hi to Fuller for me.

973
00:57:27.736 --> 00:57:28.970
What?

974
00:57:37.278 --> 00:57:39.481
You should've let me
kick his ass.

975
00:57:40.782 --> 00:57:44.019
I just saved yours.

976
00:57:44.085 --> 00:57:48.023
So you and this guy Gamble
were partners, huh?

977
00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:50.425
So how long you got
the babysitter for?

978
00:57:52.327 --> 00:57:53.895
Just because
I bought you a drink

979
00:57:53.962 --> 00:57:57.432
doesn't mean
you get laid tonight.

980
00:57:57.499 --> 00:58:00.135
So what
does two drinks mean?

981
00:58:02.738 --> 00:58:05.306
Do you want to come
over to my house?

982
00:58:05.373 --> 00:58:07.709
That was easy.

983
00:58:07.776 --> 00:58:10.579
It's my kid's birthday
party tomorrow.

984
00:58:10.646 --> 00:58:12.180
Tomorrow?

985
00:58:13.214 --> 00:58:16.952
Uh, kids, birthday parties...

986
00:58:17.018 --> 00:58:19.020
I'm hosting a Tupperware
party tomorrow.

987
00:58:20.622 --> 00:58:21.790
You, Tupperware?

988
00:58:21.857 --> 00:58:24.025
Yeah, seals in the freshness.

989
00:58:24.092 --> 00:58:26.895
Party's completely booked,
otherwise I'd invite you.

990
00:58:26.962 --> 00:58:28.964
Tomorrow, noon.

991
00:58:35.403 --> 00:58:37.272
Central, open South Sally port.

992
00:58:43.845 --> 00:58:45.681
All right, gentlemen,
take a seat.

993
00:59:15.777 --> 00:59:18.614
You may have won the battle,
but you lost the war!

994
00:59:20.582 --> 00:59:21.726
Dad, can I have
some of this?

995
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:22.884
Yeah, go ahead, get it.

996
00:59:22.951 --> 00:59:24.119
Can I have this too?

997
00:59:24.185 --> 00:59:26.145
Whatever you want. Get it,
get it, get it, get it.

998
00:59:34.195 --> 00:59:35.530
Look at that.

999
00:59:35.597 --> 00:59:37.999
A cop who drinks
French champagne, huh?

1000
00:59:38.667 --> 00:59:40.235
That is just

1001
00:59:40.301 --> 00:59:41.670
impressive.

1002
00:59:42.671 --> 00:59:44.172
I may work in the mud,

1003
00:59:44.239 --> 00:59:46.374
but I certainly like to
play up in the clouds.

1004
00:59:49.377 --> 00:59:51.479
I thought you said
you'd fix the sink.

1005
00:59:53.448 --> 00:59:55.183
This is
Lieutenant Harrelson,

1006
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:56.584
Olympic SWAT commander.

1007
01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:04.736
This is top priority.
Patch me through

1008
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.203
to all black-and-whites
in the area...

1009
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:10.966
I've got to go.

1010
01:00:11.032 --> 01:00:12.977
Kids, come on, come on.
It's time to ruin Mommy's day.

1011
01:00:13.001 --> 01:00:14.069
Okay.

1012
01:00:14.135 --> 01:00:15.737
But you killed
in the soccer game.

1013
01:00:24.345 --> 01:00:26.915
Baby, I have to go play
cops and robbers.

1014
01:00:26.982 --> 01:00:28.049
Okay.

1015
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:30.585
Okay.

1016
01:00:30.652 --> 01:00:32.553
I love you.
You too.

1017
01:00:49.971 --> 01:00:51.606
Hey, guys.

1018
01:00:51.673 --> 01:00:56.411
The reason we are gathered on our
God-given much-needed day of rest

1019
01:00:56.477 --> 01:00:58.847
is we have a Polish hostage.

1020
01:00:58.914 --> 01:01:00.081
So what if he's Polish?

1021
01:01:00.148 --> 01:01:01.750
No, no, no.
Means he's one of those

1022
01:01:01.817 --> 01:01:04.986
"Anybody comes in, I'll blow
my head off" type of guy.

1023
01:01:05.053 --> 01:01:07.588
Negotiations aren't going well.

1024
01:01:07.655 --> 01:01:09.224
They think he's off his meds.

1025
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.625
We've been lobbing gas,

1026
01:01:10.692 --> 01:01:12.169
and this guy's still
smoking cigarettes,

1027
01:01:12.193 --> 01:01:14.730
popping off shotgun rounds
out the front door.

1028
01:01:17.065 --> 01:01:19.935
I want a limo, a 12-pack,

1029
01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:22.403
and clove cigarettes!

1030
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.807
I say we go in the back,
hard, with shields.

1031
01:01:25.874 --> 01:01:28.076
Negative. Guy says
he has all the doors

1032
01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.778
and windows wired
with high explosives.

1033
01:01:29.845 --> 01:01:31.146
Come on, Greg.

1034
01:01:31.212 --> 01:01:33.414
Look, Dan, you wrote the book.
I just read it.

1035
01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.016
Any suggestions?

1036
01:01:38.286 --> 01:01:39.554
I've got an idea.

1037
01:02:02.944 --> 01:02:04.112
Ready?

1038
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.019
It's the damn robot aliens.

1039
01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:24.099
Down! Down!

1040
01:02:24.165 --> 01:02:25.366
Get down!

1041
01:02:25.433 --> 01:02:26.968
Down! Get down!

1042
01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:28.469
Down!

1043
01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.305
Put your hands behind your back.

1044
01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:31.506
Stay down.

1045
01:02:31.572 --> 01:02:34.876
You know what?
I think he might be Polish.

1046
01:02:34.943 --> 01:02:37.212
Unbelievable.

1047
01:02:37.278 --> 01:02:39.447
Like opening
a can of sardines.

1048
01:02:39.514 --> 01:02:40.548
It works.

1049
01:03:08.343 --> 01:03:10.111
Drop Fruit of the Loomski
in the A-car.

1050
01:03:12.313 --> 01:03:15.083
Damn, man. You need to
be selling that shit on eBay.

1051
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:16.517
I only got one.

1052
01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.353
Split the profits
50-50.

1053
01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:21.722
Corner the market. Break
them down like a shotgun.

1054
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:23.624
"The Polish Penetrator."

1055
01:03:24.625 --> 01:03:26.461
Hold on, sports fans.

1056
01:03:26.527 --> 01:03:28.029
I just got a call
from Sheriff's.

1057
01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:30.932
It seems we've been holding
a high-priority international

1058
01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:32.400
and didn't even know it.

1059
01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:33.701
They want us as escorts?

1060
01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:35.770
You're my new favorite crew.

1061
01:03:35.837 --> 01:03:37.572
Just get the prisoner
to the headquarters.

1062
01:03:43.444 --> 01:03:44.745
This is 9-Tom King,

1063
01:03:44.812 --> 01:03:46.547
transporting inmates
to Superior.

1064
01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:49.250
We've got a black-and-white
signaling pullover.

1065
01:03:49.317 --> 01:03:51.152
Roger that.
What's your 10-20?

1066
01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.522
Hollywood and Wilcox.

1067
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:57.658
9-Tom King, stand by while we
identify the black-and-white.

1068
01:03:57.725 --> 01:03:58.894
Roger.

1069
01:04:02.931 --> 01:04:04.265
9-Tom King,
there is a problem

1070
01:04:04.332 --> 01:04:05.967
with one of your transports.

1071
01:04:06.034 --> 01:04:08.503
The unit signaling is probably
providing interception.

1072
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:10.438
Can you read his patrol number?

1073
01:04:10.505 --> 01:04:13.508
Negative. It's an LAPD
black-and-white.

1074
01:04:13.574 --> 01:04:14.809
Stand by while we confirm.

1075
01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.053
9-Tom King,
this is 70-David.

1076
01:04:58.119 --> 01:04:59.320
What's your location?

1077
01:05:00.455 --> 01:05:02.223
9-Tom King, do you copy?

1078
01:05:05.093 --> 01:05:06.427
What about me, boss?

1079
01:05:07.562 --> 01:05:09.364
Let's go.
Get these off.

1080
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:11.666
9-Tom King,
there is a problem.

1081
01:05:11.732 --> 01:05:13.201
9-Tom King, do you copy?

1082
01:05:14.435 --> 01:05:16.271
There it is, on the right.

1083
01:05:16.337 --> 01:05:17.939
9-Tom King,
do you copy?

1084
01:05:18.006 --> 01:05:19.807
This is 70-David.

1085
01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:22.543
We're Code 6 with the bus
at Hollywood and Wilcox.

1086
01:05:24.345 --> 01:05:26.414
114, this is 70-David.

1087
01:05:26.481 --> 01:05:28.083
We're Code 4.

1088
01:05:31.352 --> 01:05:33.554
114, this is 70-David.

1089
01:05:33.621 --> 01:05:36.024
We're Code 6
at Hollywood and Wilcox.

1090
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:04.470
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1091
01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:38.853
Out of the car!
Get out of the car!

1092
01:06:38.919 --> 01:06:40.555
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

1093
01:06:41.322 --> 01:06:42.923
Down! Down!

1094
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:44.868
Get out of the car! HONDO:
Put your hands on your head!

1095
01:06:44.892 --> 01:06:46.761
Freeze! Put your
hands on your head!

1096
01:06:48.429 --> 01:06:49.764
Hands up!

1097
01:06:54.035 --> 01:06:55.570
Hollywood, huh?

1098
01:06:57.972 --> 01:06:59.107
On the ground.

1099
01:06:59.174 --> 01:07:00.508
On the ground!

1100
01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:13.421
Hey! Do not move!

1101
01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:15.090
Do not move!

1102
01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:18.059
Move again.

1103
01:07:21.929 --> 01:07:24.365
Drama in
Hollywood today.

1104
01:07:24.432 --> 01:07:26.667
An explosive and
deadly day in Hollywood

1105
01:07:26.734 --> 01:07:29.437
as a gun battle erupted
between armed suspects

1106
01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:32.840
and members of LAPD's
elite SWAT unit.

1107
01:07:32.907 --> 01:07:34.175
Details are still sketchy,

1108
01:07:34.242 --> 01:07:36.377
but sources tell us
there were fatalities,

1109
01:07:36.444 --> 01:07:39.347
including two Los Angeles
County Sheriff's deputies.

1110
01:07:40.948 --> 01:07:43.351
At approximately 1:45 p.m. today,
a Sheriff's Department bus

1111
01:07:43.418 --> 01:07:46.754
was assaulted by two
suspects armed with AK-47s

1112
01:07:46.821 --> 01:07:49.457
in an attempt to break out
a jailed detainee.

1113
01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:52.127
We are awaiting
the arrival of Alex Montel,

1114
01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.761
the international fugitive

1115
01:07:53.828 --> 01:07:56.030
wanted in over
a dozen countries.

1116
01:07:56.097 --> 01:07:58.099
Montel is wanted on
Interpol warrants

1117
01:07:58.166 --> 01:08:01.369
by more than 10 national
governments, including our own,

1118
01:08:01.436 --> 01:08:03.471
in relationship to
charges of arms dealing,

1119
01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:06.474
drug trafficking, extortion,
smuggling, kidnapping,

1120
01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:08.243
and over two dozen murders.

1121
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:11.246
Domestic and
foreign law enforcement agencies

1122
01:08:11.312 --> 01:08:13.981
are already jockeying
to interrogate the man

1123
01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:18.653
one high-level White House aide
has dubbed simply "The Catch."

1124
01:08:21.589 --> 01:08:24.725
I will give $100 million to
whoever gets me out of here!

1125
01:08:28.296 --> 01:08:29.564
Let's go.

1126
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.803
$100 million!

1127
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:37.381
The family's
legitimate business

1128
01:08:37.405 --> 01:08:39.474
throughout Europe
and the Middle East

1129
01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.852
are rumored to be fronts for their
criminal activity throughout the world.

1130
01:08:41.876 --> 01:08:43.711
The family fortune
is estimated to be

1131
01:08:43.778 --> 01:08:45.513
in the high
hundreds of millions,

1132
01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.548
if not billions, of dollars.

1133
01:08:47.615 --> 01:08:50.685
I will give $100 million to
whoever gets me out of here!

1134
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:52.653
100 million sound good to me.

1135
01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.921
Hell, yeah.

1136
01:09:01.329 --> 01:09:02.997
Are we hot? We rolling?

1137
01:09:03.063 --> 01:09:06.033
We have limited footage of the
dramatic events this afternoon.

1138
01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:10.671
$100 million to whoever
gets me out of here.

1139
01:09:13.741 --> 01:09:16.444
The family's fortune is estimated
in the billions of dollars.

1140
01:09:16.511 --> 01:09:18.879
An offer of $100 million...

1141
01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:20.348
Who does this guy
think he is, huh?

1142
01:09:20.415 --> 01:09:21.749
$100 million...

1143
01:09:28.589 --> 01:09:31.659
Hey, ese, are you for
real or what, homes?

1144
01:09:31.726 --> 01:09:34.462
Huh? Hey, I'm talking
to you, ese.

1145
01:09:36.331 --> 01:09:38.899
We've been looking
for this punk a long time.

1146
01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:42.203
Busted taillight brings him down?
That's amazing.

1147
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:44.071
The plan is to
have you escort him

1148
01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:45.806
to a federal prison
out in the desert.

1149
01:09:45.873 --> 01:09:48.643
You may want to have press
photographers meet us at the facility,

1150
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:50.611
soon as my boys hand him over.

1151
01:09:50.678 --> 01:09:52.280
It's a hell of a story, huh?

1152
01:09:52.347 --> 01:09:54.682
Yeah, we'll pass that request
up the ladder to D.C.

1153
01:09:54.749 --> 01:09:55.916
Good.

1154
01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.185
Gentlemen, at 1300 hours,

1155
01:09:58.253 --> 01:10:01.489
an LAPD helicopter will arrive
to transport the defendant.

1156
01:10:01.556 --> 01:10:05.059
Until we get him inside a federal
facility, he's our baby.

1157
01:10:05.125 --> 01:10:07.161
Sergeant Howard, your
team's got the high ground.

1158
01:10:07.228 --> 01:10:08.529
Yes, sir.

1159
01:10:08.596 --> 01:10:10.898
Sergeant Hondo, your boys
are going to provide

1160
01:10:10.965 --> 01:10:13.601
close-proximity protection
for the prisoner. Copy that.

1161
01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:15.135
Sergeant Yamoto,

1162
01:10:15.202 --> 01:10:16.947
you're going to set up a
perimeter around Parker Center.

1163
01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:17.972
I'm on it.

1164
01:10:18.038 --> 01:10:19.039
Piece of cake.

1165
01:10:28.316 --> 01:10:30.918
Roger, 10-David.
We're coming out.

1166
01:10:33.721 --> 01:10:35.990
Okay, guys, let's get
this frog in the bird.

1167
01:10:38.326 --> 01:10:40.561
What's $100
million six ways, Box?

1168
01:10:40.628 --> 01:10:42.930
Sixteen-something.

1169
01:10:42.997 --> 01:10:45.099
Man, I'd have floor
seats at the Lakers,

1170
01:10:45.165 --> 01:10:46.634
put my kids through college,

1171
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:49.036
hire Halle Berry
as my yoga instructor.

1172
01:11:06.354 --> 01:11:08.356
Match engine power.
RPMs match.

1173
01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:14.929
Gear down now.

1174
01:11:33.848 --> 01:11:35.483
Cover!

1175
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:36.750
We've been hit!
We've been hit!

1176
01:11:39.887 --> 01:11:41.088
Shots fired. Shots fired.

1177
01:11:41.155 --> 01:11:42.395
Anybody see where it came from?

1178
01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:49.430
They hit second engine.
We are going down.

1179
01:11:49.497 --> 01:11:51.932
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
We're going down!

1180
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:56.871
Down!

1181
01:12:18.426 --> 01:12:19.960
Everybody okay?
Yeah.

1182
01:12:20.027 --> 01:12:21.772
T.J., Sanchez, take the suspect.
Move! Move!

1183
01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.431
Let's go! Let's go!

1184
01:12:23.498 --> 01:12:25.966
70-David to 114.
We're coming in.

1185
01:12:30.905 --> 01:12:32.707
Come here.
Hey, hey, hey!

1186
01:12:32.773 --> 01:12:33.941
Jim! Jim! Street!

1187
01:12:34.008 --> 01:12:35.275
Keep it together, buddy.

1188
01:12:35.342 --> 01:12:36.553
Keep it together.
Keep it together.

1189
01:12:36.577 --> 01:12:38.312
Street!

1190
01:12:38.379 --> 01:12:41.181
Knock it off. We don't have
time for your personal shit.

1191
01:12:41.248 --> 01:12:43.283
Move him out.
Let's move!

1192
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:45.085
Let's go. Move!

1193
01:12:51.258 --> 01:12:53.178
You tell them
we're under goddamn attack!

1194
01:12:53.227 --> 01:12:54.862
An LAPD
airship is down.

1195
01:12:54.929 --> 01:12:56.540
How do you want us to
proceed at this point?

1196
01:12:56.564 --> 01:12:57.898
What the hell happened?

1197
01:12:57.965 --> 01:12:59.166
Somebody shot our bird down.

1198
01:12:59.233 --> 01:13:01.402
No shit. How?

1199
01:13:01.469 --> 01:13:04.204
My guess is big-bore rifle,
probably .50 caliber.

1200
01:13:04.271 --> 01:13:05.551
Somebody who knows
how to use it.

1201
01:13:05.606 --> 01:13:06.950
We're at a whole
new level here, Captain.

1202
01:13:06.974 --> 01:13:08.454
So where the hell
is the shooter, huh?

1203
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:12.813
I want this asshole
out of here, now.

1204
01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.357
The best bet's to
keep him on lockdown

1205
01:13:14.381 --> 01:13:15.559
till we figure out
who we're dealing with, sir.

1206
01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:17.084
Captain Fuller?
Yes?

1207
01:13:17.151 --> 01:13:19.111
I've got the chief of police
on the phone for you.

1208
01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:22.122
So now we're talking
about my ass.

1209
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:23.824
You draw up a plan,
you execute it,

1210
01:13:23.891 --> 01:13:25.392
and do not screw this up.

1211
01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.061
Have it transferred
to my office.

1212
01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.004
Can't believe how much grief

1213
01:13:37.071 --> 01:13:39.339
that frog's $100 million
offer's bringing us.

1214
01:13:43.143 --> 01:13:44.688
You guys ready? You know
what you've got to do?

1215
01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:46.046
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir.

1216
01:13:46.113 --> 01:13:47.247
Where's T.J.?

1217
01:13:47.314 --> 01:13:48.683
I'm right here, Hondo.

1218
01:13:48.749 --> 01:13:50.350
Sorry, man.

1219
01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:52.262
Had some bad Thai food last night.
It's not sitting well with me.

1220
01:13:52.286 --> 01:13:54.121
So you
good to go, or what?

1221
01:13:54.188 --> 01:13:55.823
No, I'm good now.

1222
01:13:57.191 --> 01:13:59.460
Let's go make the captain
look like a hero.

1223
01:13:59.527 --> 01:14:00.595
Be safe out there.

1224
01:14:00.661 --> 01:14:02.663
I'm headed to the bird.

1225
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:03.998
All right, we're moving out.

1226
01:14:05.065 --> 01:14:06.667
Let's load them up!

1227
01:14:18.879 --> 01:14:20.047
Time to go.

1228
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.451
Put that on.

1229
01:14:37.297 --> 01:14:38.999
Marry me! Marry me!

1230
01:14:42.737 --> 01:14:45.105
Marry me!

1231
01:15:15.369 --> 01:15:16.503
Hey!

1232
01:15:17.705 --> 01:15:18.806
Come on!

1233
01:15:34.989 --> 01:15:37.958
Hey, come on, now. Get
out of the damn street!

1234
01:15:38.025 --> 01:15:39.359
Wait there.

1235
01:15:39.426 --> 01:15:40.895
Come on, now!

1236
01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:54.101
Alex, let's go!

1237
01:16:56.236 --> 01:16:57.537
Get down!

1238
01:16:57.604 --> 01:16:58.706
Get down now!

1239
01:16:58.773 --> 01:17:00.140
Get on the ground!

1240
01:17:00.207 --> 01:17:01.275
Move!

1241
01:17:24.364 --> 01:17:26.000
I don't know, talk to them.

1242
01:17:26.066 --> 01:17:28.568
Try to make it work.

1243
01:17:28.635 --> 01:17:29.904
Look, I've had enough problems

1244
01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:31.371
for one day, you know?

1245
01:17:33.007 --> 01:17:34.775
Hey, where's Mike?

1246
01:17:34.842 --> 01:17:35.943
Family emergency.

1247
01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:37.812
Just let me know if there's
anything you need.

1248
01:17:37.878 --> 01:17:41.348
All right. Just try to get us
there alive, for starters.

1249
01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:06.974
My sister's dating some new guy.

1250
01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:08.308
Yeah?

1251
01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:10.586
Yeah. I met him for the
first time the other night.

1252
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:12.612
Good for her.

1253
01:18:12.679 --> 01:18:14.199
Not really. He's kind
of a knucklehead.

1254
01:18:15.515 --> 01:18:17.317
You should give her a call.

1255
01:18:17.384 --> 01:18:19.754
You know, if you want.

1256
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.156
All right, yeah.
Maybe I will.

1257
01:18:22.222 --> 01:18:23.657
10-David to 70-David.

1258
01:18:23.724 --> 01:18:25.659
Word our motorcade has been hit.

1259
01:18:25.726 --> 01:18:27.161
Any damage?

1260
01:18:27.227 --> 01:18:29.396
Terry Fargas is dead.
Aw, damn.

1261
01:18:29.463 --> 01:18:30.640
We've got
two patrol officers

1262
01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:31.799
on the table at County.

1263
01:18:31.866 --> 01:18:33.633
What's your
location, 10-David?

1264
01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.435
Right on top of you.

1265
01:18:39.406 --> 01:18:41.341
That's good to know.
Yeah.

1266
01:18:41.408 --> 01:18:42.509
T.J.,

1267
01:18:42.576 --> 01:18:44.011
stay alert back there.

1268
01:18:44.078 --> 01:18:45.512
They're coming
out of the woodwork.

1269
01:18:47.381 --> 01:18:49.416
American greed.

1270
01:18:49.483 --> 01:18:50.650
Shut up.
So reliable.

1271
01:18:50.717 --> 01:18:52.753
Shut up!

1272
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.980
Another officer's dead because
you shot your mouth off.

1273
01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:57.792
That's how I like cops.

1274
01:18:57.858 --> 01:19:00.160
Dead.
Want to join him?

1275
01:19:00.227 --> 01:19:02.096
Huh?

1276
01:19:02.162 --> 01:19:04.298
He knew the dangers, no?

1277
01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:07.234
That's why he signed up
to be a police officer.

1278
01:19:07.301 --> 01:19:09.669
Carry a gun in the Wild West.

1279
01:19:09.736 --> 01:19:12.606
Like you, cowboy.

1280
01:19:12.672 --> 01:19:15.442
Would you be sitting here if
this job wasn't dangerous?

1281
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:17.912
Anyway,

1282
01:19:17.978 --> 01:19:20.647
killing him probably got
you 20 new recruits.

1283
01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:22.682
You should thank me.

1284
01:19:22.749 --> 01:19:24.785
Yeah, you're right.
I should.

1285
01:19:24.852 --> 01:19:26.987
Boxer, thank him
for me, will you?

1286
01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.222
Love to.

1287
01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:37.798
We are coming
up on Checkpoint One.

1288
01:19:37.865 --> 01:19:39.800
Roger, Hondo. I see it.

1289
01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.137
Making the turn
at Checkpoint One.

1290
01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.680
Hardcore, Sanchez.

1291
01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:55.816
I'm watching
everyone's hands.

1292
01:19:55.883 --> 01:20:00.320
Empty hand, no weapon, I'm going
home to my little girl, Deke.

1293
01:20:00.387 --> 01:20:02.189
I'm going home to my brats too.

1294
01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:04.959
We are now
approaching Checkpoint Two.

1295
01:20:05.025 --> 01:20:06.927
T.J., relax, man.

1296
01:20:06.994 --> 01:20:09.263
Hondo transported the President
like this back in '96.

1297
01:20:09.329 --> 01:20:10.397
No one had a clue.

1298
01:20:12.132 --> 01:20:14.768
Hey, my friends.
I can double my offer.

1299
01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:18.105
66 million for each of you.

1300
01:20:18.172 --> 01:20:20.040
All you have to do is
let me go right here,

1301
01:20:20.707 --> 01:20:22.042
and don't worry.

1302
01:20:22.109 --> 01:20:23.177
I'll find my way home.

1303
01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:25.112
You got the cash?

1304
01:20:25.179 --> 01:20:26.480
Because we don't take a check.

1305
01:20:26.546 --> 01:20:28.548
Come on.
Be smart about this.

1306
01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:30.217
What do you make?

1307
01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:32.086
66,000 a year?

1308
01:20:32.152 --> 01:20:34.721
Not
even with overtime.

1309
01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.556
Loser.

1310
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:43.730
Making the turn
at Checkpoint Two.

1311
01:20:47.534 --> 01:20:49.669
My view of Car Two
has been blocked.

1312
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.942
T.J., what's happening?

1313
01:20:55.009 --> 01:20:56.877
I got a pedestrian
in the crosswalk, Hondo.

1314
01:20:56.944 --> 01:20:58.946
I'll be on your tail
in about 10 seconds.

1315
01:20:59.013 --> 01:21:01.415
Roger that.

1316
01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:03.717
Hands where I can see them, guys.
Come on.

1317
01:21:03.783 --> 01:21:05.061
T.J., what the hell
are you doing?

1318
01:21:05.085 --> 01:21:07.021
What the hell does it
look like I'm doing?

1319
01:21:07.087 --> 01:21:08.923
I'm taking Frenchie
here up on his offer.

1320
01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:10.109
Now, you guys just be smart.

1321
01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:11.558
Hands up, Box.
Come on.

1322
01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:13.493
Come on, hands up.
Hands up, Box.

1323
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.171
Let's go. Let me see it.
Hands up! Let's go!

1324
01:21:17.464 --> 01:21:19.566
What the hell was that?

1325
01:21:19.633 --> 01:21:21.011
What the hell
was that, Brian?

1326
01:21:21.035 --> 01:21:22.545
He was going for his piece.
No, he wasn't!

1327
01:21:22.569 --> 01:21:23.837
I had it under control!

1328
01:21:23.904 --> 01:21:25.372
You didn't have to shoot him!

1329
01:21:25.439 --> 01:21:28.175
What do you say, Jimbo?
Want to be a cowboy?

1330
01:21:28.242 --> 01:21:29.944
T.J., Street, Boxer.

1331
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.411
Car Two, respond.

1332
01:21:31.478 --> 01:21:32.622
We're catching up to you, Sarge.

1333
01:21:32.646 --> 01:21:33.890
We'll be there in about...
Officer down!

1334
01:21:33.914 --> 01:21:35.916
Seventh and Hope!

1335
01:21:35.983 --> 01:21:38.018
Flip a bitch.
Flipping a bitch.

1336
01:21:44.524 --> 01:21:45.926
10-David.
Move!

1337
01:21:45.993 --> 01:21:47.494
10-David!

1338
01:21:47.561 --> 01:21:49.839
Do you have a location on car number two?
Move! Move! Move!

1339
01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:52.699
Roger. Car Two is stopped
at Seventh and Hope.

1340
01:21:52.766 --> 01:21:53.968
Do me a favor.

1341
01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.036
Tell Fuller it was me
who pulled this off, yeah?

1342
01:21:56.103 --> 01:21:58.463
I'm not going to let you
get away with this, Gamble.

1343
01:21:58.505 --> 01:22:00.807
Well, you ain't got a
say in the matter, do you?

1344
01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:03.086
Suspects appear to
be wearing tactical clothing

1345
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:04.611
and have automatic weapons.

1346
01:22:06.413 --> 01:22:07.948
T.J., don't do this!

1347
01:22:09.783 --> 01:22:12.652
I got an officer down! Officer down!
Seventh and Hope!

1348
01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:16.423
Suspects are entering the
Pershing Square MTA station.

1349
01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:32.039
Boxer! Boxer, hang in there!
Hang in there.

1350
01:22:32.106 --> 01:22:34.975
You okay? STREET: I'm all right.
Boxer got hit.

1351
01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:36.977
We're going to
need an ambulance!

1352
01:22:37.044 --> 01:22:39.246
Who did this?
It was Gamble.

1353
01:22:39.313 --> 01:22:41.281
Box! Get him up. Get him over!

1354
01:22:41.348 --> 01:22:43.683
It was T.J. and Gamble.
They've gone down the subway.

1355
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.385
Let's go hunting.

1356
01:22:48.522 --> 01:22:49.589
I'm going to get the kit.

1357
01:22:49.656 --> 01:22:50.957
Take care of him.
Yeah.

1358
01:22:51.025 --> 01:22:52.892
Street, let's go!

1359
01:22:52.959 --> 01:22:55.895
This is 73-David.

1360
01:22:55.962 --> 01:22:57.931
I need an RA unit
as soon as possible

1361
01:22:57.998 --> 01:22:59.766
to the corner
of Hope and Seventh.

1362
01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:02.302
Officer down! I
repeat, officer down!

1363
01:23:15.549 --> 01:23:16.816
All right, T.
We're in.

1364
01:23:16.883 --> 01:23:18.218
Let's go.

1365
01:23:19.053 --> 01:23:20.454
Hit the juice, Grandpa.

1366
01:23:23.023 --> 01:23:24.658
Come on, Box.

1367
01:23:24.724 --> 01:23:27.061
Come on, come on, come on!

1368
01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:28.162
What do we got?

1369
01:23:28.228 --> 01:23:29.339
Gunshot wound
to the neck.

1370
01:23:29.363 --> 01:23:30.664
Vitals?
None.

1371
01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:33.600
Come on! Let's go!

1372
01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:52.986
Oh... Oh...

1373
01:23:59.926 --> 01:24:02.729
Always one step behind.

1374
01:24:02.796 --> 01:24:04.664
This is 70-David
at Seventh and Hope.

1375
01:24:04.731 --> 01:24:07.367
Suspects are on eastbound
train number 507,

1376
01:24:07.434 --> 01:24:09.636
headed to Metro Center
at 7th and Figueroa.

1377
01:24:09.703 --> 01:24:11.405
Have the rail unit contact MTA

1378
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:13.307
and shut down that train
at the next station.

1379
01:24:13.373 --> 01:24:15.609
Roger that, 70-David.

1380
01:24:15.675 --> 01:24:18.845
What are they gonna do, take the
subway all the way to Mexico?

1381
01:24:18.912 --> 01:24:20.747
Come on,
check for secondary wounds.

1382
01:24:20.814 --> 01:24:23.517
Sanchez...
Deke, Sanchez.

1383
01:24:23.583 --> 01:24:25.085
Meet that train
at the next station.

1384
01:24:25.152 --> 01:24:26.620
73-David, we copy.

1385
01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:33.026
You'd better be good for it.

1386
01:24:33.093 --> 01:24:35.662
I assure you,
if anyone is, it's me.

1387
01:24:52.646 --> 01:24:54.381
I want you to set
up a perimeter.

1388
01:24:54.448 --> 01:24:55.649
Nobody comes in the station

1389
01:24:55.715 --> 01:24:57.384
and nobody gets off a train.

1390
01:24:57.451 --> 01:24:58.885
Yes, sir. You got it.

1391
01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:06.092
Rail unit,
this is 10-David.

1392
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.195
I've got my men headed
to the Figueroa station.

1393
01:25:08.262 --> 01:25:11.097
Now, are you ready to stop that train?
Yes, sir.

1394
01:25:32.186 --> 01:25:33.306
Where the hell's this train?

1395
01:25:33.353 --> 01:25:35.322
Never made it.
Should've been here by now.

1396
01:25:35.389 --> 01:25:37.891
Sanchez to Hondo. The train
never made it to Figueroa.

1397
01:25:48.202 --> 01:25:50.370
Secure the station.
SWAT's got it.

1398
01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:32.246
Got people.

1399
01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:34.548
Hands up! Let me see your hands!

1400
01:26:34.614 --> 01:26:35.782
Now!

1401
01:26:37.951 --> 01:26:39.586
Hands. Hands!

1402
01:26:42.188 --> 01:26:44.057
Hands. Show me
your hands.

1403
01:26:44.123 --> 01:26:45.292
Hands.

1404
01:26:59.105 --> 01:27:00.607
Where are they?

1405
01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:02.342
They said they were
going to kill me.

1406
01:27:02.409 --> 01:27:04.344
They're not coming back.

1407
01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:06.713
Down the shaft.

1408
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:13.186
Where'd they go?

1409
01:27:17.824 --> 01:27:19.426
10-David, this is 70-David.

1410
01:27:19.493 --> 01:27:22.362
Suspects have entered what
appears to be a storm drain

1411
01:27:22.429 --> 01:27:24.898
approximately a quarter-mile
north of Metro Center.

1412
01:27:24.964 --> 01:27:26.175
Roger that, 70-David.

1413
01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:27.901
We'll deploy above ground
accordingly.

1414
01:27:29.168 --> 01:27:31.070
We're going in after them.

1415
01:27:49.523 --> 01:27:51.725
This shaft intersects
with the storm drain system.

1416
01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:52.968
They could pop
out of any manhole

1417
01:27:52.992 --> 01:27:54.193
within a five-mile radius.

1418
01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:55.771
How many manholes
are we talking about?

1419
01:27:55.795 --> 01:27:56.996
Six thousand.
Six thousand?

1420
01:27:57.063 --> 01:27:59.399
I can't cover 6,000...

1421
01:27:59.466 --> 01:28:00.734
R-Commander,
10-David.

1422
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.977
I want you to put
that airship down

1423
01:28:02.001 --> 01:28:03.903
and give me a command post

1424
01:28:03.970 --> 01:28:06.039
at Sixth and Hope Street,

1425
01:28:06.105 --> 01:28:07.345
and give me a landline, Code 2.

1426
01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:20.954
70-David
to 10-David.

1427
01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.657
70-David to 10-David.

1428
01:28:25.024 --> 01:28:27.260
70-David to 114.
Do you read me?

1429
01:28:29.663 --> 01:28:30.897
70-David to 114.

1430
01:28:30.964 --> 01:28:32.499
Do you read me?

1431
01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.870
We got no reception down here.

1432
01:28:36.936 --> 01:28:39.172
Gamble wants us on an island...

1433
01:28:40.073 --> 01:28:41.441
He's got it.

1434
01:28:41.508 --> 01:28:42.976
Stay alert, guys.

1435
01:28:43.677 --> 01:28:45.412
They went this way.

1436
01:28:53.953 --> 01:28:56.189
We have
ID'd those suspects.

1437
01:28:56.255 --> 01:28:57.691
Great. Who are they?

1438
01:28:57.757 --> 01:29:00.460
Former Officer Gamble
and Officer T.J. McCabe.

1439
01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:04.798
Gamble?

1440
01:29:04.864 --> 01:29:06.800
As in Street's
ex-partner, Gamble?

1441
01:29:06.866 --> 01:29:08.101
Roger.

1442
01:29:09.035 --> 01:29:10.704
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1443
01:29:13.807 --> 01:29:16.175
There is some kind of
plan here, right?

1444
01:29:18.545 --> 01:29:20.580
There's
your plan, Pumpkin.

1445
01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:23.550
We have got two SWAT-trained
guys leading this attack.

1446
01:29:23.617 --> 01:29:25.395
How do we know the rest of
the team isn't in on it?

1447
01:29:25.419 --> 01:29:27.587
Because I can vouch for Hondo.

1448
01:29:27.654 --> 01:29:29.389
You willing to bet
$100 million on that?

1449
01:29:46.773 --> 01:29:47.974
Bingo.

1450
01:30:00.019 --> 01:30:01.179
You've got to be shitting me.

1451
01:30:03.423 --> 01:30:06.359
If they're good, this is only
going to slow them down, T.J.

1452
01:30:06.426 --> 01:30:08.562
This was supposed to be
simple snatch and extract.

1453
01:30:08.628 --> 01:30:09.763
Boxer was a threat, T.J.

1454
01:30:09.829 --> 01:30:11.364
Boxer was my friend!
He was mine too.

1455
01:30:11.431 --> 01:30:12.899
Stop crying. You can
buy new friends.

1456
01:30:15.168 --> 01:30:17.604
Don't give me any more
reason to kill you.

1457
01:30:17.671 --> 01:30:20.173
What are you going
to do, shoot me?

1458
01:30:22.609 --> 01:30:25.244
You should relax
a little bit, my friend.

1459
01:30:25.311 --> 01:30:27.080
I'm the money here.
Don't forget it.

1460
01:30:28.515 --> 01:30:29.795
We don't have time
for this shit.

1461
01:30:30.684 --> 01:30:32.786
Look, you can go ahead.

1462
01:30:32.852 --> 01:30:34.187
I know this sucks.

1463
01:30:34.253 --> 01:30:36.690
Let's worry about it
in paradise, all right?

1464
01:30:36.756 --> 01:30:37.791
Come on.

1465
01:30:45.532 --> 01:30:47.376
Have we re-established
communication with Hondo's team?

1466
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.468
Not yet, sir.

1467
01:30:48.535 --> 01:30:51.605
70-David,
advice your location, please.

1468
01:30:51.671 --> 01:30:53.372
70-David, come in.

1469
01:30:53.439 --> 01:30:54.741
Hondo, where the hell are you?

1470
01:30:59.045 --> 01:31:01.147
Whoa. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1471
01:31:02.081 --> 01:31:03.483
What's that?

1472
01:31:09.288 --> 01:31:11.558
It's phosphorescent paint.
Oh, yeah?

1473
01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:13.960
Keep your eyes
on the wall for more.

1474
01:31:47.627 --> 01:31:48.795
Gas masks?

1475
01:31:48.862 --> 01:31:50.564
It's just smoke.

1476
01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.999
We're going to have
to go in blind.

1477
01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:10.584
What's going on?

1478
01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:12.852
Tripwire.

1479
01:32:12.919 --> 01:32:14.253
Live mine.

1480
01:32:15.021 --> 01:32:16.656
Whoa. Claymore.

1481
01:32:16.723 --> 01:32:17.757
Nasty stuff.

1482
01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:18.992
No shit.

1483
01:32:19.058 --> 01:32:21.094
There's an old Indian saying.

1484
01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.496
"Where there's
one white man..."

1485
01:32:23.563 --> 01:32:24.864
"There's more white men."

1486
01:32:28.234 --> 01:32:30.704
What? Do you hear something?

1487
01:32:32.906 --> 01:32:34.473
No.

1488
01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.275
That's the problem.

1489
01:32:45.118 --> 01:32:47.153
Come on, we've got to move.

1490
01:32:50.389 --> 01:32:51.691
Hey, y'all smell like shit.

1491
01:32:51.758 --> 01:32:52.959
Yeah, that'd be a sewer.

1492
01:32:53.026 --> 01:32:55.328
Where's our air? On
track and on schedule.

1493
01:32:55.394 --> 01:32:56.462
Wonderful.

1494
01:32:57.330 --> 01:32:59.098
T.J., ride with me.

1495
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.402
Come on, guys!
Got to go!

1496
01:33:03.469 --> 01:33:05.781
All units in the
vicinity of the Hawthorne Airport...

1497
01:33:05.805 --> 01:33:08.675
Residents report beacon lights
turned on after closing hours.

1498
01:33:11.645 --> 01:33:13.179
Dispatch,
this is R-Commander.

1499
01:33:13.246 --> 01:33:15.126
Deploy all available units
to Hawthorne Airport.

1500
01:33:15.181 --> 01:33:17.050
Call the FAA for details.

1501
01:33:17.116 --> 01:33:18.327
They're going to fly him out
of the country, God damn it.

1502
01:33:18.351 --> 01:33:19.719
10-David,
this is R-Commander.

1503
01:33:19.786 --> 01:33:21.330
Get you and your men over
there as soon as possible.

1504
01:33:21.354 --> 01:33:22.722
Roger that.

1505
01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:25.992
Unit One, what's your status?

1506
01:33:26.059 --> 01:33:30.129
We are approximately 45 miles
due east of Point Bravo.

1507
01:33:30.196 --> 01:33:31.765
We have begun our descent.

1508
01:33:31.831 --> 01:33:33.532
That's a six-minute ETA.

1509
01:33:33.599 --> 01:33:34.734
Roger that.

1510
01:33:49.783 --> 01:33:51.184
Ain't this a bitch?

1511
01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:53.687
A cold, hard one.

1512
01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:55.030
10-David
to R-Commander.

1513
01:33:55.054 --> 01:33:56.790
We are approaching
Hawthorne Airport.

1514
01:34:01.627 --> 01:34:04.063
Street!
How about the Claymore?

1515
01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:06.232
Shit.
I'll be back. Deke!

1516
01:34:46.505 --> 01:34:47.941
10-David
to R-Commander.

1517
01:34:48.007 --> 01:34:50.443
We have established a
perimeter around the airport.

1518
01:34:50.509 --> 01:34:52.445
Additional SWAT units
are en route.

1519
01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.450
Van One, Van Two, you have
less than five minutes.

1520
01:35:00.787 --> 01:35:03.189
Roger that, 10-David. Any
word from Hondo's team yet?

1521
01:35:03.256 --> 01:35:05.591
70-David is still
out of radio contact.

1522
01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:08.694
Hondo, you son of a bitch.

1523
01:35:08.762 --> 01:35:11.364
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1524
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:14.200
Remember when you asked me what
I used to do in the SEALs?

1525
01:35:14.267 --> 01:35:15.534
Oh, yeah.

1526
01:35:17.636 --> 01:35:19.272
All right, clear.

1527
01:35:33.452 --> 01:35:35.121
Fire in the hole.

1528
01:35:40.827 --> 01:35:43.830
10-David,
this is 70-David.

1529
01:35:43.897 --> 01:35:45.231
70-David, where
the hell are you?

1530
01:35:45.298 --> 01:35:48.367
We are somewhere around
Sixth and Trenton.

1531
01:35:48.434 --> 01:35:51.137
We lost communication in the tunnels.
Where's our backup?

1532
01:35:51.204 --> 01:35:53.082
Everything I have is going
to Hawthorne Airport.

1533
01:35:53.106 --> 01:35:55.942
That's where your friends, Gamble and T.J.
McCabe are headed.

1534
01:35:56.009 --> 01:35:57.449
That's the other
side of town!

1535
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:58.845
Send a couple units
to pick us up.

1536
01:35:58.912 --> 01:36:00.746
Pick you up?

1537
01:36:00.814 --> 01:36:02.581
For all I know,
you're in on this.

1538
01:36:02.648 --> 01:36:04.750
I've got a good mind
to bring you in.

1539
01:36:04.818 --> 01:36:06.419
Like hell.
Come on, let's go.

1540
01:36:11.457 --> 01:36:13.092
Police! Stop the car!

1541
01:36:13.159 --> 01:36:14.627
Stop the car!

1542
01:36:16.495 --> 01:36:17.797
Stop the car!

1543
01:36:17.864 --> 01:36:20.099
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

1544
01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.735
Exit the car, sir!

1545
01:36:22.802 --> 01:36:24.279
You guys are gonna
have to get out of here.

1546
01:36:24.303 --> 01:36:25.614
Police emergency.
We need your vehicle.

1547
01:36:25.638 --> 01:36:27.106
Wait, I just have
kids in the car.

1548
01:36:27.173 --> 01:36:28.707
Well, get them
out of there!

1549
01:36:28.774 --> 01:36:30.719
Look like it's you and me in the
gun cage this time tomorrow.

1550
01:36:30.743 --> 01:36:32.078
You know how it is, Street.

1551
01:36:32.145 --> 01:36:33.355
Sometimes doing the right thing

1552
01:36:33.379 --> 01:36:34.747
ain't doing the right thing.

1553
01:36:48.094 --> 01:36:49.195
Last car through.

1554
01:36:49.262 --> 01:36:51.397
Bridge is locked.
Copy that.

1555
01:36:55.401 --> 01:36:56.511
I thought you couldn't drive.

1556
01:36:56.535 --> 01:36:57.712
I never said I couldn't drive.

1557
01:36:57.736 --> 01:36:59.138
I said I didn't like to.

1558
01:36:59.205 --> 01:37:00.706
Keep getting into accidents.

1559
01:37:02.341 --> 01:37:04.810
Sounds like they're trying to
fly him out of here. Yeah.

1560
01:37:04.878 --> 01:37:07.546
Why would they turn on the landing
lights and warn everybody?

1561
01:37:07.613 --> 01:37:09.916
Shit! Gamble's
smarter than that.

1562
01:37:09.983 --> 01:37:11.226
Look, there's
a full moon out tonight.

1563
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:12.995
Even a rookie pilot could
land on a night like this.

1564
01:37:13.019 --> 01:37:14.720
So why'd they pop up back there?

1565
01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:17.627
I don't know, but I know Fuller's
sending every man we got to Hawthorne.

1566
01:37:29.835 --> 01:37:31.470
Did they build a new
airport in downtown

1567
01:37:31.537 --> 01:37:33.272
in the past couple of days?

1568
01:37:33.339 --> 01:37:35.641
I don't think so,
Sanchez. Why?

1569
01:37:35.708 --> 01:37:37.643
That jet
to your right.

1570
01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:40.146
It's flying pretty low, and
it's only getting lower.

1571
01:37:42.949 --> 01:37:44.389
That's our boy!
That's our boy!

1572
01:37:44.417 --> 01:37:45.457
He's setting down.

1573
01:37:45.518 --> 01:37:46.619
Yeah, but where?

1574
01:37:46.685 --> 01:37:48.321
I don't know,
but follow that jet.

1575
01:38:04.971 --> 01:38:06.705
How wide is the
Sixth Street Bridge?

1576
01:38:06.772 --> 01:38:08.541
It's got to be
four lanes across,

1577
01:38:08.607 --> 01:38:09.842
sidewalks...

1578
01:38:09.909 --> 01:38:11.853
Plane small enough, he might
be able to set it down,

1579
01:38:11.877 --> 01:38:13.012
if he's got the balls.

1580
01:38:28.427 --> 01:38:30.596
Reducing speed.

1581
01:38:30.663 --> 01:38:33.199
This is 70-David. That plane's
not coming to Hawthorne.

1582
01:38:33.266 --> 01:38:36.169
I gave you a direct order
to stand down, Sergeant.

1583
01:38:36.235 --> 01:38:37.636
And I would have, Tom,

1584
01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:40.639
except I saw a Learjet about to
land on the Sixth Street Bridge.

1585
01:38:42.075 --> 01:38:43.176
Give me 40% flaps.

1586
01:38:43.242 --> 01:38:44.877
40% flaps. Check.

1587
01:38:44.944 --> 01:38:49.215
Sir, we have reports of a low-flying
aircraft in the downtown area.

1588
01:38:49.282 --> 01:38:51.050
Where's the nearest backup?

1589
01:38:51.117 --> 01:38:53.052
Five, six minutes.

1590
01:38:53.119 --> 01:38:55.488
I don't think you're
feeling me on this, Tom.

1591
01:38:55.554 --> 01:38:56.689
We're going in.

1592
01:39:08.334 --> 01:39:09.502
Oh...

1593
01:39:09.568 --> 01:39:10.669
Oh, God.

1594
01:39:18.011 --> 01:39:19.891
Reverse thrust. COPILOT: Roger that.
Full brake.

1595
01:39:21.314 --> 01:39:22.982
This guy's worth every penny.

1596
01:39:55.414 --> 01:39:56.682
All right,

1597
01:39:56.749 --> 01:39:58.817
let's turn this plane around.

1598
01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:02.788
10-David,
we just got a report

1599
01:40:02.855 --> 01:40:05.291
a plane has landed
on the Sixth Street Bridge.

1600
01:40:06.359 --> 01:40:08.127
They what?

1601
01:40:08.194 --> 01:40:09.595
Let's mount up!

1602
01:40:09.662 --> 01:40:11.262
All right, give me a
car downstairs, now.

1603
01:40:23.642 --> 01:40:26.011
What... What...
What's going on?

1604
01:40:26.079 --> 01:40:27.780
Just got room for one of you.

1605
01:40:27.846 --> 01:40:29.291
I'm not going
anywhere without my wife.

1606
01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:31.684
Well, then, don't.
No, no, no.

1607
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:33.052
Richard!

1608
01:40:33.886 --> 01:40:35.388
Richard! Richard...

1609
01:40:35.454 --> 01:40:37.623
Richard is gone,
so sit down and shut up.

1610
01:40:37.690 --> 01:40:40.726
20 seconds!
See you in Margaritaville.

1611
01:40:40.793 --> 01:40:41.936
Come on, come on,
come on!

1612
01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.396
Won't you just let me go?

1613
01:40:43.462 --> 01:40:45.698
Please, just let me go!
Shut her up.

1614
01:40:45.764 --> 01:40:47.533
Please, let me go!
Shut the hell up.

1615
01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.667
Get us in the air.

1616
01:40:50.269 --> 01:40:52.705
Yes, sir.
Okay, let's go home.

1617
01:40:52.771 --> 01:40:55.241
Oh, look. They've got
their own airport security.

1618
01:41:08.821 --> 01:41:10.089
You've got company!

1619
01:41:10.156 --> 01:41:11.490
Limo broke containment!

1620
01:41:11.557 --> 01:41:13.037
All right, we've
got you covered, man.

1621
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.568
Just keep coming.

1622
01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:28.741
Boom.

1623
01:41:31.277 --> 01:41:32.811
Son of a bitch!

1624
01:41:42.288 --> 01:41:43.422
Here.

1625
01:41:45.324 --> 01:41:46.625
What's this?

1626
01:41:46.692 --> 01:41:48.361
Well, that'd be a cell phone.

1627
01:41:48.427 --> 01:41:50.639
That's the account number where
I want the money transferred.

1628
01:41:50.663 --> 01:41:53.732
The bank verifies the transfer,
goddamn, if you ain't a free man.

1629
01:41:53.799 --> 01:41:56.001
70-David, be advised
there are hostages on board.

1630
01:41:56.068 --> 01:41:58.070
All right, you heard the man.

1631
01:41:58.137 --> 01:42:00.072
Deke!
Yo!

1632
01:42:00.139 --> 01:42:02.541
They get that plane off the
ground, those hostages are dead.

1633
01:42:02.608 --> 01:42:04.310
I need your
A-game, boys...

1634
01:42:04.377 --> 01:42:05.411
And girl.

1635
01:42:14.853 --> 01:42:17.122
What's going on? Get
them off our asses!

1636
01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:18.591
Just fly the plane.
Open the hatch.

1637
01:42:18.657 --> 01:42:19.792
Open the hatch!
I'm on it!

1638
01:42:31.504 --> 01:42:33.739
Hang on, guys.

1639
01:42:33.806 --> 01:42:36.742
Here's where watching The World's
Most Exciting Police Chases pays off.

1640
01:42:39.878 --> 01:42:41.146
I got no shot!

1641
01:42:45.017 --> 01:42:46.485
Get this thing in the air!

1642
01:42:47.553 --> 01:42:48.687
Shut the door!

1643
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:52.925
Shut that goddamn door!

1644
01:43:27.626 --> 01:43:28.761
Damn it!

1645
01:43:28.827 --> 01:43:31.330
I hope you've got
a plan B, brother.

1646
01:43:31.397 --> 01:43:33.799
You stay there.
You're fine.

1647
01:44:03.228 --> 01:44:04.897
Gamble! Let her go!

1648
01:44:04.963 --> 01:44:06.399
Take a shot, Jimbo!

1649
01:44:13.972 --> 01:44:15.741
Sanchez is down!
Sanchez...

1650
01:44:19.712 --> 01:44:21.714
Go get him.

1651
01:44:24.483 --> 01:44:25.584
Give me more ammo!

1652
01:44:30.389 --> 01:44:31.890
Deke! Frog's running!

1653
01:44:31.957 --> 01:44:34.293
Are you okay?
I'm all right, man.

1654
01:44:46.705 --> 01:44:49.308
Sorry, ma'am. I've got to go, too.
No.

1655
01:45:00.285 --> 01:45:01.620
Tell Daddy how you want it.

1656
01:45:28.246 --> 01:45:29.682
Ahhh!

1657
01:45:29.748 --> 01:45:31.684
You're like a goddamn rash.

1658
01:45:37.623 --> 01:45:39.343
You might wanna
get that looked at, brother.

1659
01:45:56.475 --> 01:45:57.576
How's Boxer?

1660
01:45:57.643 --> 01:45:58.844
What do you care?

1661
01:45:58.911 --> 01:46:00.946
Come on, Hondo.
Just give me that.

1662
01:46:02.214 --> 01:46:03.315
He's going to make it.

1663
01:46:04.717 --> 01:46:05.818
Good.

1664
01:46:06.885 --> 01:46:08.454
Just couldn't resist, could you?

1665
01:46:10.656 --> 01:46:11.857
So what do you want to do?

1666
01:46:16.462 --> 01:46:18.163
God damn it, Sarge.

1667
01:48:11.243 --> 01:48:13.712
There's one
in the chamber, partner.

1668
01:48:16.915 --> 01:48:18.150
Come on.

1669
01:49:09.835 --> 01:49:11.136
So how's Boxer?

1670
01:49:11.203 --> 01:49:13.163
Got word he's going to pull through.
That's great.

1671
01:49:15.708 --> 01:49:17.743
Remind me to buy
some shares in Kevlar.

1672
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:18.877
Good work, Sanchez.

1673
01:49:21.279 --> 01:49:23.115
You look like you
need a Band-Aid.

1674
01:49:23.181 --> 01:49:25.250
Somebody else needs
a body bag downstairs.

1675
01:49:27.285 --> 01:49:28.353
You okay?

1676
01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.755
Yeah. You?

1677
01:49:31.056 --> 01:49:32.524
Nice job.

1678
01:49:32.591 --> 01:49:34.426
Don't sound so happy.

1679
01:49:34.492 --> 01:49:36.494
Still got a problem.

1680
01:49:37.295 --> 01:49:38.897
He's still here.

1681
01:49:44.637 --> 01:49:45.738
Road trip?

1682
01:49:47.906 --> 01:49:49.642
Road trip.
Yeah.

1683
01:49:50.943 --> 01:49:52.344
Road trip.

1684
01:49:52.410 --> 01:49:54.246
Guess you'll have
to fire us later.

1685
01:50:03.656 --> 01:50:05.523
We're here
to transfer custody

1686
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:10.228
of LA Police Department prisoner
number 109672 into federal custody.

1687
01:50:10.295 --> 01:50:13.098
Thank you, sir. I will
accept the transfer.

1688
01:50:20.038 --> 01:50:21.273
Enjoy your new home.

1689
01:50:26.879 --> 01:50:30.115
Try your best to get
to know the guys, huh?

1690
01:50:30.182 --> 01:50:31.516
Yeah, 100 mil ought to buy you

1691
01:50:31.583 --> 01:50:33.285
a nice husband in there.

1692
01:50:50.368 --> 01:50:51.904
Where to, boys?

1693
01:50:53.105 --> 01:50:54.206
Oh...

1694
01:50:55.573 --> 01:50:57.309
Home sounds like a winner.

1695
01:51:01.213 --> 01:51:04.582
Girls like you get
guys like me in trouble.

1696
01:51:04.649 --> 01:51:08.220
You think I should've taken
the 100 million?

1697
01:51:08.286 --> 01:51:10.166
All units, we
have a 211 in progress

1698
01:51:10.222 --> 01:51:12.691
at the Diamond Mart,
43, South Hope Street.

1699
01:51:12.758 --> 01:51:14.126
Shots fired.

1700
01:51:14.192 --> 01:51:16.995
Technically, our watch has
been over for 12 hours.

1701
01:51:17.062 --> 01:51:18.096
So?

1702
01:51:22.735 --> 01:51:23.836
Yeah.

1703
01:51:24.937 --> 01:51:26.705
Well, what the hell.

1704
01:51:27.572 --> 01:51:28.841
Mount up.

1705
01:51:30.242 --> 01:51:31.576

* Fading on the corner
Is a man with a plan

1749
01:54:54.779 --> 01:54:57.349
* People took a stand
'Cause the businessman ran

1750
01:54:57.415 --> 01:55:00.152
* The streets at night
Sound just like...

1751
01:55:00.218 --> 01:55:03.188
* The place where they took
The slaughter to the lamb

1752
01:55:03.255 --> 01:55:05.823
* Mama never wanted me
To be no cop

1753
01:55:05.890 --> 01:55:08.660
* Voted most likely
In high school to drop

1754
01:55:08.726 --> 01:55:11.663
* Now I'm dressed to impress
In a bulletproof vest

1755
01:55:11.729 --> 01:55:14.366
* Back in action
Wearin' SWAT on my chest

1756
01:55:20.305 --> 01:55:22.975
* S-W-A-T

1757
01:55:23.041 --> 01:55:25.543
* T-S-O-L-P-P

1758
01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:56.841
* S-W-A-T

1759
01:55:56.908 --> 01:55:59.411
* T-S-O-L-P-P

1760
01:56:05.383 --> 01:56:07.952
* S-W-A-T

1761
01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:10.588
* T-S-O-L-P-P
