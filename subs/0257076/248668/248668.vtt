1
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.760
I'm killing whoever moves!
You move, I'm killing you!

2
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

3
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.520
- We're 30 seconds out, boys.
- All right.

4
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.480
Let's rock 'n' roll.

5
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.840
This is a table.

6
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.040
We have four cameras
over the tellers.

7
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.160
- Do we have a visual?
- Almost.

8
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.720
- We cut their phones?
- Yes, sir.

9
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.640
Soon as you get tapped in,
let me have it.

10
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.280
Do not let them get mobile.

11
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.680
- He's down.
- Goddamn it! They got Bob!

12
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.080
Grab somebody! Grab somebody
and bring them up here!

13
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.400
- Get up.
- No.

14
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.520
- I said, get up!
- No!

15
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.840
Throw a body out there,
tell them we mean business!

16
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.880
Street, 10-David. Storeroom is clear.

17
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.400
Almost to the lobby.

18
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.080
Shut up!

19
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.640
- 10-David wants us to hold.
- Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

20
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.840
We hold, they die.

21
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.640
I guess we're not holding.

22
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.960
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill somebody!

23
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.360
They just capped E ddie! How the hell
we gonna get out of here?

24
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.200
Shut up, I'm thinking!

25
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.400
Please.

26
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.400
Stop whining! I'll put a bullet
in your head!

27
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.160
Shut up!

28
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.280
What are they doing?

29
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.000
This is Rick from the L.A.P.D.
Can you hear me okay?

30
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.720
10-David to the 1-4 corner.
Confirm that you have containment.

31
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.640
Roger, we're holding
on the 1-4 corner.

32
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.640
- We're holding top of stairwell.
- Shut up.

33
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.480
Gamble, Street, where are you?
Why aren't you responding?

34
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.880
Let's be cool. Calm down.

35
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.240
I'm controlling this situation!
You understand me?

36
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.680
- Please.
- We need to go!

37
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.960
No, please. Somebody...

38
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.840
Help me. Help me.

39
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.680
Gamble, Street, why aren't you
responding? Now!

40
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.520
Oh, God!

41
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.960
Kill that bitch and throw her out front!

42
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.160
Get that guy off our fence!

43
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.320
I said to kill that bitch
and throw her out front!

44
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.160
I'm on TV!

45
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.760
Street, 10-David. Lobby is clear.

46
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.360
Two suspects are neutralized.

47
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.040
I need an RA unit
for a gunshot wound to a hostage.

48
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.080
You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
Ambulance is on the way.

49
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.360
Got them, right?

50
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.760
Jimbo?

51
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.960
- She'll be okay?
- I'm not a doctor.

52
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.680
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

53
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.080
Boss is gonna tear you guys
a new one, huh?

54
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.160
Same place he did the last time,
time before that.

55
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.520
Good luck.

56
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.480
I don't care what they say.

57
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.960
You guys were heroes out there.

58
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.520
That was some cocky shit out there.

59
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.680
You know how to play this, right?

60
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.120
That woman is alive
because of what we did.

61
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.400
Yeah, alive and suing the city
for millions.

62
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.720
Chief says if he pays,
somebody else does too...

63
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.400
...and it sure isn't gonna be me.

64
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.960
- Fuller, we get two seconds to make...
- Capt. Fuller!

65
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.480
Capt. Fuller, we get two seconds
to make a decision.

66
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.760
You get two months to sit there
and tear it apart.

67
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.200
SWAT means "Special Weapons
And Tactics."

68
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.040
Where were your tactics out there?

69
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.880
Saving a woman from getting shot.
That's where they were.

70
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.680
Every cop knows
we did the right thing.

71
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.520
Sometimes doing the right thing
isn't doing the right thing.

72
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.280
- What the hell does that mean?
- Sergeant.

73
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.720
You disobeyed a direct order.
End of story. You're both off SWAT.

74
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.280
They're two of our best officers.

75
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.960
I'm not sticking them in the field
after a stunt like that.

76
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.280
Sorry, I didn't know that saving lives
was a stunt.

77
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.160
You got a big mouth,
and you're quick on the trigger...

78
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.240
...and that is why your ass
is in a sling.

79
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.080
If you're gonna put them off SWAT,
at least keep them in the division.

80
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.880
Give them a shot at getting back.

81
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.560
Stick them in the gun cage.
Get them out of my sight.

82
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.600
- Gun cage?
- This is total bullshit.

83
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.120
- What?
- I said, this is bullshit.

84
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.240
- Really?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.600
You should consider yourself lucky
Lt. Velasquez is standing up for you.

86
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.880
I'm lucky I don't work
for an asshole like you.

87
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.440
That's it! You're out of here, Gamble!
You're gone!

88
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.080
- Control yourself!
- Get out of here!

89
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.400
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Street!

90
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.440
- You stay.
- Hey!

91
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.880
Give us a minute.

92
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.200
Please, sit down.

93
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.960
I'll stand.

94
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.600
Look, Jim...

95
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.440
...we both know that Gamble is a bad
influence on the rest of the team.

96
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.440
Gamble's a good cop.

97
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.240
Unlike him, you still have a chance
at a future here.

98
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.640
You go on record that Gamble
acted recklessly...

99
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.720
...and you had to follow your partner in
after he disobeyed orders...

100
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.880
...and I will make sure that you are
back on SWAT tomorrow morning.

101
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.720
Let's get the hell out of here.

102
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.960
I need a cocktail.

103
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.120
I'm staying.

104
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.080
You're what? What...?

105
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.000
- After that?
- Couple months...

106
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.720
...Fuller will find new asses to
chew out. We'll be back on the team.

107
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.040
Fuller is the cockroach
of this department, brother.

108
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.840
He's not gonna give us
a second chance.

109
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.760
What are you gonna do? Piss away
all the hard work you did to get here?

110
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.960
Piss what away, Jimmy?

111
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.720
The cage?

112
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.000
Come on, man.

113
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.400
We're better than that,
and you know it.

114
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.800
You gonna come with me?

115
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.440
A real partner wouldn't have
to ask that, would he?

116
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.640
A real partner would step up
to what he did in the bank.

117
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.240
- Yeah. I saved the hostage.
- You disobeyed the hold.

118
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.440
- No, I saved that hostage!
- You disobeyed the hold!

119
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.160
You made the decision yourself.

120
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.840
And you shot a hostage.
Jesus, Brian!

121
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.040
You sound a lot like Fuller.

122
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.080
Is that what you two were talking
about in there?

123
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.920
Did you rat me out?

124
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.360
You cut a deal to get back
on the team, Jimmy?

125
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.240
- Did I cut a deal?
- Yeah, did you?

126
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.480
How many times have I covered up
for one of your goddamn stunts?

127
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.840
That's what a partner's
supposed to do.

128
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.560
You just picked a paycheck
over me, bro.

129
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.360
You just picked yourself
over everything else.

130
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.040
You want to stay here
and be Fuller's bitch...

131
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.920
...you go right ahead.
I can't do it.

132
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.840
I can't do it.

133
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.320
Damn it. Goddamn it.
Goddamn it, Jim!

134
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.400
Partners for five years.
This is how you want to end it.

135
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.680
I didn't end it.

136
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.680
You sold me out to the brass.

137
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.840
You know, I never realized till now
how full of shit you are.

138
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.560
Fuck you and SWAT.

139
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.040
- You're too attached to that soda, Gus.
- Love that stuff.

140
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.440
The wife would have my behind
if she busted me sucking that down.

141
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.440
Why, is she a Mr. Pibb fan?

142
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.920
You know the deal, Jim.

143
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.320
When we got married,
I converted to Mormonism.

144
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.560
We can't consume anything
that alters our state of mind.

145
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.960
We treat our bodies with respect.

146
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.680
And I treat mine
like an amusement park.

147
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.160
It's the differences
that make this country great.

148
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.280
Need them cleaned
by the morning, boys.

149
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.280
You were supposed to have
it in a half-hour ago.

150
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.680
What, your boy gonna report me
to the captain?

151
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.520
Just for thinking you look good
in that mustache.

152
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.480
Your mom seems to like it, though.

153
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.480
So does your sister.

154
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.040
Hey, sarge, welcome back.

155
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.720
- Look who's back.
- Welcome back, sarge.

156
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.480
What's up, Hondo?

157
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.640
Hey, sarge.

158
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.080
- Howdy.
- What do you need?

159
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.040
Sgt. Hondo? You're back.

160
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.880
You know what they say, Gus.
You're either SWAT or you're not.

161
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.400
Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

162
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.080
Oh, just a tune-up.

163
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.080
But please, don't touch my sights.

164
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.040
- And I made some modifications...
- To the trigger too.

165
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.080
- And you are?
- Jim Street.

166
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.080
Street.

167
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.360
Yeah, we'll leave them intact.

168
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.600
- I need that back by tomorrow.
- Can do, sergeant.

169
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.840
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.

170
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.360
Gosh, Gus, is that a woody?

171
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.600
Heck, yeah. That's Hondo.

172
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.520
He's old-school SWAT.

173
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.920
The gold standard of ass-kicking.

174
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.520
Sorry, butt-kicking. I guess he's back.

175
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.240
I guess he is.

176
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.120
A weeklong series,
attacking us top to bottom.

177
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.720
And it's all SWAT's fault, right?

178
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.280
No, the chief's been pretty fair
about blaming everyone.

179
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.160
He does want these
bad headlines to end.

180
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.880
He wants the old warhorses to help
restore the luster.

181
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.320
Old? I know you ain't
talking about me.

182
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.800
You gotta shake off
that three-year rust from Rampart.

183
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.360
- I'm throwing you in right away.
- Sooner the better.

184
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.440
I want you to put together a young,
kick-ass element for me, Dan.

185
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.840
You select them, you train them,
you mold them.

186
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.360
I know you're not talking about giving
me five pups fresh out of the gate.

187
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.080
- I didn't come back to wipe noses.
- Hell, no.

188
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.720
Now, you worked with T.J. And Boxer
at Southwest.

189
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.040
- You up for supervising them here?
- That's a start.

190
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.320
Now all you have to do
is find three fresh ones.

191
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.400
Only catch is, Fuller has
to approve the three.

192
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.960
What did Capt. Fuller say when he
heard the chief was bringing me back?

193
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.600
Hasn't stopped swearing since.

194
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.600
What's your brother's truck
doing outside?

195
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.320
We having a garage sale
I don't know about?

196
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.200
You weren't supposed to be home
for an hour.

197
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.200
Sorry to screw up your getaway.

198
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.040
Look, let's not make this
a thing, okay?

199
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.040
We both knew it was coming.

200
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.240
It's not like we were in this
to get married, right?

201
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.400
And you've changed since...

202
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.720
Well, people change.

203
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.400
Look, when it was good
it was great, right?

204
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.280
That means something.

205
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.160
Yeah, thanks.

206
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.720
- Damn it!
- Hey! Hey!

207
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.800
I'm gonna throw this thing out.

208
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.640
Do and you die.

209
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.360
Every SWAT team in the world's
gonna have one someday.

210
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.320
It's 50 pounds of scrap metal.

211
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.880
All right.

212
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.680
Say you got some crazy suspect
barricaded in a house.

213
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.800
- All right.
- Just chain this to the back of a truck...

214
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.920
...shove this end
right through the wall...

215
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.160
...these rods spring out
like fishhooks.

216
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.280
Your partner guns the truck,
takes the whole wall with him.

217
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.760
And we waltz right in
and surprise the bad guy, right?

218
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.240
Correct.

219
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.960
I call it "The Key to the City."

220
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.280
- Patent pending.
- Is that right?

221
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.280
Right.

222
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.000
Let me get your M-4.

223
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.920
And...

224
00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.520
Took the rattle out of the receiver.

225
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.720
Yeah, new buffer, new gas rings.
Cleaned the gas tube.

226
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.800
Surprised you didn't starch the sling.

227
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.680
If you want me to show you how to
shoot it, I'm here all week, 9 to 5.

228
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.400
Shooters, on the line!

229
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.320
Stand by! Ready!

230
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.360
Put them on safe and holster.

231
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.560
No roll, Hondo?

232
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.080
How do you know I didn't?

233
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.080
You didn't, did you?

234
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.280
They only roll in John Woo movies,
not real life.

235
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.000
All right.

236
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.280
Here's the winner.

237
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.120
There's a few people
that I would like to thank.

238
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.240
My fellow SWAT officers, all of you,
thank you for believing in me...

239
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.160
...when the bosses didn't give me
a chance.

240
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.600
That's why you're the marksman and
I'm the guy who tells you who to shoot.

241
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.200
Here you go. I got you covered
since I let you down.

242
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.960
Tell you what...

243
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.840
...I got 100 here says that guy
can kick your ass.

244
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.840
Are you kidding me, Hondo?
Come on. He's our gun bunny.

245
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.040
Oh, well, let's make it 200 then.

246
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.960
Sure. A couple more lap dances
for me tonight.

247
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.960
- Want a piece of this?
- Yeah.

248
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.040
Don't look so worried.

249
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.840
Yo.

250
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.560
Wanna make some extra money?

251
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.880
Hey, don't forget to take
your safety off.

252
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.640
- Street.
- You better get your game face on.

253
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.480
Don't beat him so badly I can't get
a rematch, all right?

254
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.720
I won't make any promises.

255
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.440
It's my money, man.

256
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.320
Shooters, on the line!

257
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.120
Shooters, on the line!

258
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.880
Stand by! Ready!

259
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.240
Put them on safe! Holster!

260
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.960
Here's your winner.

261
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.200
I won, baby.

262
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.200
Thoroughbred!

263
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.880
Yeah, yeah. Passport, please.

264
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.360
Next.

265
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.480
- Next.
- You have anything to declare?

266
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.720
I don't know how you got this
through De Gaulle.

267
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.000
You can't bring this
through the airport.

268
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.640
For luck. Luck.

269
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.600
Gift from my father. Not dangerous.

270
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.360
- Mail it home.
- Okay.

271
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.080
Mail it home.

272
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.360
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay. "Merci."

273
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.240
- Hey, Gus!
- Yeah.

274
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.880
Isn't that eternal damnation
you're chowing down there?

275
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.680
You can't tell Michelle.

276
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.880
Isn't she gonna smell the fries
on your breath?

277
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.040
That's why God invented mouthwash.
She'll never know.

278
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.240
Gus, you're cheating on your wife
with fast food.

279
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.280
You're right. You're absolutely right.

280
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.200
Street, you have a driver's license?

281
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.480
- Got a library card.
- That's good enough.

282
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.000
So get your uniform on.
You're driving me today.

283
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.440
Come on.

284
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.160
Did you get my return ticket
and papers?

285
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.240
Flight leaves tonight at midnight.

286
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.400
- No one knows I'm here?
- Just me.

287
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.400
Where do you wanna go?

288
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.080
It's my uncle's birthday.

289
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.760
I want to surprise him.

290
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.040
If you want me to come by
and mow your lawn later...

291
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.480
...I'm available, sergeant.
- I'll keep that in mind.

292
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.400
Call me Hondo.

293
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.400
I was a Marine. Did two years
in Nam, recon unit.

294
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.960
Spent the next four teaching
combat survival. You serve?

295
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.320
- Yeah.
- Navy SEALs, right?

296
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.800
- That's what my file says.
- So, what did you do for them?

297
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.960
Besides rescue Marines
when they got lost?

298
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.800
You sniper detail,
amphibious assault, what?

299
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.760
My boat-crew leader always said
if anyone knew what we did...

300
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.000
...we'd failed.

301
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.960
That's fair enough.

302
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.800
So where are we going, Hondo?

303
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.760
What say we go see what
the weather's like in South Central?

304
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.760
Tell us where your boyfriend is.

305
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.600
Look, I don't speak Spanish!
Tell me where your boyfriend is!

306
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.640
You're not helping him any!
You're not...

307
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.840
Somebody here gonna get locked up!

308
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.920
R-61-15 in foot pursuit.

309
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.280
Suspect headed south,
west of Defiance.

310
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.360
One black male in Lakers purple.

311
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.680
That's our guy talking.
Where's he at?

312
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.520
What the hell you doing, Navy SEAL?

313
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.960
- Oh, hell yeah! Get on, baby, get on!
- Come on!

314
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.360
Damn! That looked like some Oakland
Raider Jack Tatum action there.

315
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.960
What you know about Jack Tatum?

316
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.000
Turn your ass over!
Put your hands behind your back!

317
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.320
- Name's Hondo.
- I don't give a damn.

318
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.720
I could've caught him myself.

319
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.160
If you like hard work, long hours
and getting dirty for low pay...

320
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.920
...I got an opening
on my SWAT team.

321
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.840
Shut up!

322
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.960
I don't mind that at all.

323
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.640
Pack your bags.
You're coming to SWAT school.

324
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.680
- SWAT school?
- Shut up!

325
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.560
Don't talk too much! Shut up!

326
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.000
Don't y'all got nothing better to do
than be hauling a black man to jail?

327
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.960
Just perpetuating the cycle,
ain't you?

328
00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.160
We'll see how liberal you are
when he's breaking into your place.

329
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.120
"Uh-huh," my ass.

330
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.280
Sure you don't want to sit
in the back?

331
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.400
I could wear a little cap.

332
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.320
I like the view from up here.

333
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.520
The cap thing's a nice touch, though.

334
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.520
Officer Burress, Southwest Division.

335
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.880
Well, your test scores are off the chart,
and you got all the right references.

336
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.960
Thank you, sergeant.

337
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.000
Can I get a hot dog with everything
and a ginger ale, please?

338
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.800
Hot dog with everything,
ginger ale.

339
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.240
- Street?
- Same.

340
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.000
Well, I will have a soy dog,
please...

341
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.880
...on a whole-wheat bun, plain...

342
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.120
...and a tomato juice, if you got it.

343
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.680
Thank you.

344
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.440
I'm a vegetarian.

345
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.840
I'm a bit curious.

346
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.160
You've been a cop six years and
you've never had a civilian complaint?

347
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.440
I try to be courteous and professional
with everyone I encounter.

348
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.280
Well, the thing is, Dave...

349
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.720
- David.
- Right. David.

350
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.200
Here's the thing.

351
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.400
There may come a time in SWAT
when you gotta get a little dirty...

352
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.680
...behind a street bust.
You know what I'm saying?

353
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.920
No.

354
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.120
How the hell can I trust a man...

355
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.320
...won't eat a good old-fashioned
American hot dog?

356
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.040
He's a vegetarian.

357
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:03.680
I'm looking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

358
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.280
I'm looking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

359
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.160
Chris Sanchez.

360
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.480
- Room five. In the corner.
- Thank you.

361
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.120
- What do you need, sarge?
- You Sanchez's partner?

362
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.640
Sanchez do that?

363
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.000
- You help?
- No, sarge.

364
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.800
Reminds me of my third divorce.

365
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.400
- Bad day, huh?
- Kiss my ass, "ése".

366
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.880
I'm starting to like
this Sanchez already.

367
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.240
Spent four years in Metro,
passed the SWAT quals three times.

368
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.240
Been rejected by Fuller three times.

369
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.720
Might be a reason.
He's got a couple of beefs here.

370
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.920
I'm going to get the nurse
to clean and dress your wound.

371
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.840
Sorry. Wrong room.

372
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.960
- Who you looking for?
- Chris Sanchez.

373
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.400
I'm Chris Sanchez.

374
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.280
You're Chris Sanchez?

375
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.800
Look, if you're Internal Affairs...

376
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.120
...that guy had razorblades
in his mouth.

377
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.080
I had to put him down hard.

378
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.160
I'm sick and tired of these bullshit
complaints because some "vato..."

379
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.920
...doesn't like getting thrown
to the pavement by a woman.

380
00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.200
I look like IAD to you?

381
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.400
Who are you?

382
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.240
Wait, now, that guy had about
100 pounds on you.

383
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.240
All brawn, no brains.
You didn't answer my question.

384
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.760
So you still want to work SWAT?

385
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.160
No, I just enjoy applying all the time.

386
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.200
Gas it up. Return it.

387
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.400
Am I looking at another day
of chauffeur duty?

388
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.160
- Team's almost filled.
- Not that it hasn't been fun.

389
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.880
Well, I do have one more spot.

390
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.000
Can you think of anybody
I might've overlooked?

391
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.480
This a game or a test, sergeant?

392
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.520
- Could be a bit of both.
- Yeah, I'm a little old for games.

393
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.320
All right.

394
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.520
So how'd you like to be
back on SWAT?

395
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.520
It's not gonna happen.

396
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.160
So why you hanging
around the cage then?

397
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.480
It's a job.

398
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.960
And SWAT's a calling.

399
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.000
Anybody around you for five minutes
can tell you still got the bug.

400
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.360
All you gotta do is say yes.

401
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.400
It's not up to me or you.

402
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.360
I got a history here.

403
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.560
Yeah, let's talk about that.

404
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.440
I heard some rumors
about you and your old partner.

405
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.800
Did you give him up
in Fuller's office?

406
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.360
Because, you know, team members
gotta trust each other.

407
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.800
I'm not on your team.

408
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.320
And no, I didn't give him up.

409
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.640
You've been in that cage six months,
shining boots and fixing weapons...

410
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.440
...waiting for a second chance.

411
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.000
I got one, and I'm offering it to you.

412
00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.280
Fuller will never sign off on it.

413
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.320
You let me deal
with that paper-pushing punk.

414
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.400
I want you on my team.

415
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.480
Let me tell you, it's the sauce.

416
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.240
If you don't have the right sauce,
what do you got? You know?

417
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.000
My mother, she used to make sauce.

418
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.840
Now you go into the store,
and you buy it in a jar or in a can...

419
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.720
Alex?

420
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.000
Alex! Nobody told me
you were coming.

421
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.360
- When did you get here?
- Surprise.

422
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.160
Happy birthday, Uncle.

423
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.680
Come on, sit down. Sit.
Bring some champagne, huh?

424
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.760
Sit, eat.

425
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.720
The chief's making me take you back.

426
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.120
He's concerned about losing
all his best officers.

427
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.680
- He thinks I'm one of his best officers?
- But...

428
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.440
...he's given me complete oversight.

429
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.000
And trust me,
you got no room for error.

430
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:53.040
So I will give you Boxer, T.J. McCabe
and this new guy...

431
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.240
...Deacon Kaye.

432
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.720
I have to pass on the other two.
Sanchez is a woman, and Street...

433
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.480
Well, Street's on my shitlist.

434
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.240
Hey, I'm on your shitlist too,
and I'm the team leader.

435
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.080
You work for me now,
and it's my team to choose.

436
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.240
With all due respect, captain,
other leaders get to pick their teams.

437
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.640
And you can too.
Just pick two new people.

438
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.320
Look...

439
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.400
...just give me the team I ask for.

440
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.680
You can even call it
your shitlist team.

441
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.160
That way, if anything goes wrong,
you can put all the blame on me.

442
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.080
It'd be just like old times.

443
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.640
Okay.

444
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.320
Okay, you got your team.

445
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.760
But when you fail,
and you probably will fail...

446
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.840
...Sanchez goes back to Traffic,
and you and Street are plain gone.

447
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.840
No, not just off SWAT, off the force.

448
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.520
- You feel me?
- Oh, yeah.

449
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.400
I feel you.

450
00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.480
- Okay, I'm leaving now.
- No, don't go.

451
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.360
I have wine and cognac from home.
Come on.

452
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.920
- I must go. I have a flight to catch.
- Oh, catch another flight.

453
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.440
Let me introduce you to Monica.

454
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.760
You like this knife?

455
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.040
This is my father's knife.
He gave it to me.

456
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.280
It's a beautiful knife,
and she's a beautiful woman.

457
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.640
Now, why don't you stay, have a
good time and go back tomorrow.

458
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.000
Listen, I'm running the business now.

459
00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.040
I'm the new boss.

460
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.920
Don't joke with me, Alex.

461
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.240
And don't ever forget,
your father's running the business.

462
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.680
No, I retired him.

463
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.560
He never spoke of that to me.

464
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.920
That's because
he can't speak anymore.

465
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.760
You put your hand
in my father's pocket.

466
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.720
Not in mine.

467
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.800
If you take my money,
I'll take your life. Understood?

468
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.040
Mail it to me.

469
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.520
- Yeah!
- Smile!

470
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.960
Good evening.

471
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.040
May I see your license,
registration and proof of insurance?

472
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.960
I'm a tourist, you know.
I'm visiting the U.S.

473
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.160
I have my passport if you want.

474
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.920
Let me see it.

475
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.000
Whose car is this?

476
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.760
It belongs to my uncle. Why?

477
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.520
You got a left taillight out.

478
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.680
Hi, this is Bridget the Midget.

479
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.800
We're out here in front of the Key Club
on Sunset in beautiful Hollywood.

480
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.000
I just wonder how you can
get inside of there.

481
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.080
Anyways, we're on Sunset Boulevard,
where anything could happen.

482
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.640
Especially police harassment.

483
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.960
Hey, you guys, you're all pigs!

484
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.280
Is your uncle's name
Martin Gascoigne?

485
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.320
- Yeah. So we're okay?
- There's a warrant in that name...

486
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.520
...and I have to detain you
until we can verify who you are.

487
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.000
Sir, please step out of the vehicle.

488
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.880
- You're here awful early.
- Traffic was lighter than usual.

489
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.920
Streets must've been
damn near empty.

490
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.200
Ali's his sister.

491
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.200
And I called bottoms on the last one.

492
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.440
You called bottoms,
but that's not what you got.

493
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.240
- Yo, dog, what's up?
- What's happening?

494
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.280
- Jim.
- Boxer.

495
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.560
So, what did you do to my sister?

496
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.080
Nothing.

497
00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.560
That's not what I heard.

498
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.840
I mean, that's not the word
on the street.

499
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.280
She's all broken up over you.

500
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.600
- Don't know why. She left me.
- Dumped.

501
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.440
A case of crabs
will do that to a woman.

502
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.800
Is there something about this team
I need to know?

503
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.880
I want to know
what an asshole like you...

504
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.280
...did to my little sister
to make her leave.

505
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.920
She's 28, all right?

506
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.600
And trust me, she's not so little.

507
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.080
- Trust you?
- No, you didn't.

508
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.600
How's your last partner doing?
Gamble. He trust you too?

509
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.880
- You wanna talk about this?
- You gonna tell me?

510
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.600
Been on your chest
for a while, yeah?

511
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.080
Street!

512
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.120
You wanna talk about it?

513
00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.640
Come here.

514
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.560
- Don't talk about what you don't...
- Yo!

515
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.560
Street! It's not worth it.

516
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.160
Who else you gonna narc on?

517
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.240
Who are you?

518
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.000
Who the hell are you?

519
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.880
Guess you're not the prettiest
one here anymore, huh, T.J.?

520
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.080
Well, sounds like you've all
gotten acquainted.

521
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.320
Let's get started.

522
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.240
I'll make this simple.

523
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.120
L.A.P.D. SWAT is the most honored,
most respected...

524
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.320
...and most professional
police division in the world.

525
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.120
Go, go, go!

526
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.520
- Police!
- Police! Police!

527
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.480
That ain't gonna get it.

528
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.560
Bang.

529
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.360
Sanchez.

530
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.040
Money.

531
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.360
Oh, man.

532
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.320
That sucked.

533
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.600
- What's up, Sanchez?
- You all right there?

534
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.320
When you're done with that one,
I got one for you.

535
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.560
T.J.'s sitting on two pair.
Looking for the boat.

536
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.040
Got it.

537
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.280
Street, you got three aces.

538
00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.240
Need one to take T.J. Out.

539
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.600
Got a winner, winner!

540
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.600
All right, Deke.
Let's see what you got.

541
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.360
Ten of spades. Spade flush.
Not good enough.

542
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.320
Hondo, isn't that a straight flush?

543
00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.320
Hold the phone.

544
00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.440
Six, seven...

545
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.360
...eight, nine, ten of spades!
Straight flush.

546
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.720
Deke!

547
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.800
Beats four aces in Compton any day.

548
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.680
I think it works in Orange County too.

549
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.240
Sure you're right.
Good work, guys.

550
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.040
Police! Police!

551
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.560
Clear.

552
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.480
- Clear.
- Clear. Go.

553
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.360
That's right.

554
00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.120
SWAT is a life-saving organization,
not a life-taking one.

555
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.160
Smooth, Deke.

556
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.520
I guess if I was deaf,
I wouldn't know you were here.

557
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.280
But while you're laughing, there's
lots of people that want us to fail.

558
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.160
Get it right.

559
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.240
- Clear.
- Clear.

560
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.800
Clear.

561
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.160
Suspect, put your hands
on your head and come out.

562
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.760
- Come out!
- Come out now!

563
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.440
- Turn around.
- Go!

564
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.760
- Down.
- Get down.

565
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.400
Yeah.

566
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.160
Outstanding, guys.

567
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.120
You feel that?

568
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.000
The team's going out for beers later.
I'm buying.

569
00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.280
I'll take mine after we pass.

570
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.640
Well, Fuller's definitely
gonna try and hose us.

571
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.560
Good. I'd hate to break a sweat
just for a first-round knockout.

572
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.360
Hey, we got a big day tomorrow.
Save some.

573
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.800
I got plenty.

574
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.520
I'm depending on you
to get these guys through this.

575
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.240
I'll cover my end.

576
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.200
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, go for it.

577
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.560
Why'd you pick me?

578
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.480
To piss off the captain.

579
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.480
There are six hijackers
armed with handguns and knives...

580
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.360
...in control of that plane.

581
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.440
They've killed one hostage
and are threatening to kill the others...

582
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.800
...unless they get a pilot and fuel
within the hour.

583
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.200
There'll be SWAT officers
disguised as hostages.

584
00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.960
Other SWAT officers
will be playing the roles of terrorists.

585
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.560
And they will be trying to kill you.

586
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.600
Staff sergeants will be grading us.

587
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.760
Couldn't give us the bus, huh, Hondo?
They always give us the bus.

588
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.280
- Fuller's really got it in for us.
- You think?

589
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.360
Another thing.
There are two dynamic entry points.

590
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.920
One here beneath
the front landing gear...

591
00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.520
...one back here
by the baggage compartment.

592
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.840
I'm sure Fuller's got surprises
at both those entrances.

593
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.880
We get bogged down anywhere,
we fail.

594
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.800
Any ideas?

595
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.040
There's another way in, Hondo.

596
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.840
There's an elevator shaft
where they bring in the service carts.

597
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.040
And there's a mechanic's access
right here.

598
00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.160
- Man, that's gonna be tight as hell.
- Yeah.

599
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.080
How many men can we fit in there?

600
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.840
Men? None.

601
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.240
All right.

602
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.240
Work this out.
Get in there and break Fuller's heart.

603
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.280
- Okay.
- What do we got?

604
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.640
- Toy guns.
- Toy guns, sir. Toy guns.

605
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.040
- Let's do this.
- All right.

606
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.000
Shame you're not playing a terrorist.

607
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.400
I'm supposed to be in first class.

608
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.680
We got camera three going up.

609
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.480
Three is set.
Checked it out on the monitor.

610
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.440
- "Are you ready?"
- Oh, yeah.

611
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.560
Okay, let's see what they got.

612
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.320
- How'd you know about this place?
- I've known a few stewardesses.

613
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.240
Just a few?

614
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.360
- Stand by. We got a device.
- Same here.

615
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.760
Disarmed.

616
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.320
Set.

617
00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.600
Here we go.

618
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.720
One.

619
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.000
Boxer, one down.

620
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.320
Down!

621
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.560
Damn.

622
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.480
- "Deke?"
- I got one down.

623
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.720
- "McCabe?"
- "I got one."

624
00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.520
That's five. There's one more, guys.

625
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.960
There's a sleeper. Come on.

626
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.560
Come on.

627
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.200
That'll be six.

628
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.960
- "Clear."
- Clear.

629
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.400
- Clear.
- Clear.

630
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.720
10-David, this is 70-David.
We are Code Four. All clear.

631
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.840
Oh, yeah.

632
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Wow. Is that a new course record?

633
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.080
- Yeah.
- All right.

634
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.800
Good job, guys.

635
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.280
Damn.

636
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.920
Please, Pop, please.

637
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.320
- Yo, Sanchez.
- I'm in SWAT now.

638
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.000
Yo, Deke. Deke, is that you, man?

639
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.200
Oh, my God, Deke.

640
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.400
- Tell me that ain't you.
- You were a butterball.

641
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.680
That's all in the past.

642
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.000
I ate here every day,
worked here every summer.

643
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.000
I ended up looking like Fat Albert.

644
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.000
I'm cool. Eating right
has me looking like this.

645
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.960
Man, put that away.

646
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.440
Hey, put that away.

647
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.200
Put another in for me.

648
00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.920
Hey, yeah, break out your money.

649
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.160
- Work it, baby.
- I'll give you back change. Watch it.

650
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.640
Hey! So you're celebrating
without me, huh?

651
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.040
- Mr. Kaye, you're the master.
- Like son, like father.

652
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.720
- That was one kick-ass display today.
- That's what I'm talking about.

653
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.120
All right, but let's remember one thing.

654
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.560
If that was a real operation
and not a test...

655
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.640
...one of us would be calling
T.J.'s family...

656
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.120
...trying to explain
what went wrong today.

657
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.120
One casualty may be acceptable
by department standards...

658
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.880
...never acceptable by mine.
We clear on that?

659
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.120
Got you.

660
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.000
- Crystal.
- Yes, sir.

661
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.640
All right. Well, let's continue
celebrating tonight...

662
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.760
...but tomorrow, we're SWAT.

663
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.000
Nice.

664
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.520
I love you too.

665
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.040
Homeland Security, my ass.
They can't keep me like this.

666
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.080
I've been patient, day after day.

667
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.120
So tell me, what's going on?

668
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.760
This is the problem.
Your prints do not match your ID.

669
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.600
So they're running another check
through the FBI and Interpol.

670
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.600
Interpol, shit. Get me out of here.

671
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.840
- I'm doing everything I can.
- Do more.

672
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
This is easy.
Who do we have to pay?

673
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.400
You can't solve this problem
by throwing money at it.

674
00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.800
Then who do we have to kill?

675
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.360
Come on, guys, it's only 11:00.

676
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.520
I got a babysitter for the first time
in three months.

677
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.240
- We've been up since 4:00.
- That's weak.

678
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.920
If I get home by midnight,
I might get me some.

679
00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.040
T.J.?

680
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.560
I get home before midnight,
I'm finding some. Sorry, babe.

681
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.840
- Boxer?
- I know I'm not getting some.

682
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.560
If I don't get home soon,
my wife's gonna freak.

683
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.720
You guys suck.

684
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.400
You know how hard it is
to find a babysitter?

685
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.160
Yo, Street.

686
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.040
Did you pass?

687
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.280
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

688
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.360
- First round's on the house.
- Thanks, darling.

689
00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.680
Anything but tequila, please.

690
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.760
- No?
- No.

691
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.880
- We did good today, huh?
- Yeah.

692
00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.880
What's it like...

693
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.600
...the real thing?

694
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.760
It's faster. It's a lot faster.

695
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.640
You know that guy?

696
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.120
Used to.

697
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.800
Bye.

698
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.600
See you.

699
00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.640
It's all yours, man.

700
00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.560
- How you doing?
- Oh, man, I am good.

701
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.080
- Heard they took you back.
- Yeah.

702
00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.640
This your girlfriend?

703
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.280
No. No, she's SWAT.

704
00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.040
- She wha...?
- She's...

705
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.920
This is what it's come down to,
busting down doors with J. Lo?

706
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.640
You know, I didn't know
that they made bulletproof bras.

707
00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.160
Is it just me?
You know, I didn't know that.

708
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.360
What they need to make
are bulletproof condoms...

709
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.400
...big enough to fit your big head.

710
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.720
Nice. Good, I like it.

711
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.600
This your girlfriend? Cute.

712
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.480
No, but you can be my bitch.

713
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.040
Really?

714
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.960
No, man, leave it alone.

715
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.400
- Here we go.
- Leave it alone.

716
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.360
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm good.

717
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.640
Put it on my tab?

718
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.000
Hey, glad to see all that butt-kissing's
really paid off.

719
00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.760
Say hi to Fuller for me.

720
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.480
What?

721
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.760
You should've let me kick his ass.

722
00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.880
I just saved yours.

723
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.240
So you and this guy Gamble
were partners, huh?

724
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.120
So how long you got
the babysitter for?

725
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.600
Just because I bought you a drink
doesn't mean...

726
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.800
...you get laid tonight.

727
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.760
So, what does two drinks mean?

728
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.960
Do you want to come over
to my house?

729
00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.440
That was easy.

730
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.160
It's my kid's birthday party tomorrow.

731
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.880
Tomorrow?

732
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.840
Kids, birthday parties...

733
00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.000
I'm hosting a Tupperware party
tomorrow.

734
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:53.040
- You, Tupperware?
- Yeah, seals in the freshness.

735
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.680
Party's completely booked,
otherwise I'd invite you.

736
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.760
Tomorrow, noon.

737
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.800
Central, open South Sally port.

738
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.200
All right, gentlemen, take a seat.

739
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.960
You may have won the battle,
but you lost the war!

740
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.600
- Dad, can I have some of this?
- Yeah, go ahead, get it.

741
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.440
- Can I have this too?
- Whatever you want. Get it, get it.

742
00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.200
Look at that. A cop
who drinks French champagne.

743
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.480
That is just impressive.

744
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:12.960
I may work in the mud, but I certainly
like to play up in the clouds.

745
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.120
I thought you said you'd fix the sink.

746
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.240
- I gotta go.
- Kids, come on, come on.

747
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.080
- It's time to ruin Mommy's day.
- Okay.

748
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.600
But you killed in the soccer game!

749
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.200
Come on, don't just stand there!

750
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.280
Baby, I have to go play
cops and robbers.

751
00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.480
Okay.

752
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.240
- Okay.
- I love you.

753
00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.880
Me too.

754
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.960
Hey, guys, the reason
we are gathered on our God-given...

755
00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:21.240
...much-needed day of rest
is we have a Polish hostage.

756
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.080
- So what if he's Polish?
- No, no. Means he's one of those:

757
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.120
"Anybody comes in,
I'll blow my head off" type of guys.

758
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.800
Negotiations aren't going well.

759
00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.360
- They think he's off his meds.
- We've been lobbing gas.

760
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.440
This guy's still smoking cigarettes,
popping off shotgun rounds...

761
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.080
...out the front door.

762
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:44.040
I want a limo, a 12-pack
and clove cigarettes!

763
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.280
I say we go in the back,
hard with shields.

764
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.320
Negative. Guy says he has all
the doors and windows wired...

765
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.480
...with high explosives.
- Come on, Greg!

766
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:56.680
Look, Dan, you wrote the book.
I just read it. Any suggestions?

767
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.560
I got an idea.

768
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.480
Ready?

769
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.160
It's the damn robot aliens.

770
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.960
Down! Down! Down! Down!

771
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.480
- Down!
- Put your hands behind your back.

772
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.640
- Stay down.
- You know what?

773
00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.920
I think he might be Polish.

774
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.240
Unbelievable.

775
00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.720
- Like opening a can of sardines.
- It works.

776
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.640
Drop Fruit of the Loomski
in the A-car.

777
01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.120
Damn, man, you need to be
selling that shit on eBay.

778
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.320
- No, I only got one.
- Split the profits 50-50.

779
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.680
Corner the market.
Break them down like a shotgun.

780
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.160
"The Polish Penetrator."

781
01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.400
Hold on, sports fans. I just got a call
from Sheriff's. It seems we've been...

782
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.880
...holding a high-priority international
and didn't even know it.

783
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.160
- They want us as escorts?
- You're my new favorite crew.

784
01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.960
Just get the prisoner
to headquarters.

785
01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.040
This is 9-Tom King
transporting inmates to Superior.

786
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.840
We've got a black and white
signaling a pullover.

787
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120
Hollywood and Wilcox.

788
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.080
9-Tom King, stand by
while we identify the black and white.

789
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.440
Roger.

790
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.400
The unit signaling is probably
providing interception.

791
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.520
Can you read his patrol number?

792
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.720
Negative.
It's an L.A.P.D. Black and white.

793
01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.640
9-Tom King, this is 70-David.
What's your location?

794
01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.840
"9"- "Tom King, do you copy?"

795
01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.160
What about me, boss?

796
01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.840
Let's go. Get these off.

797
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.080
"9"- "Tom King, there is a problem."

798
01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.680
9-Tom King, do you copy?

799
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.520
There it is, on the right.

800
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.760
- "9"- "Tom King, do you copy?"
- This is 70-David.

801
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.760
We're Code Six with the bus
at Hollywood and Wilcox.

802
01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.560
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

803
01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.880
- Out of the car!
- Get out of the car.

804
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.400
- On the ground now!
- Get out of the car!

805
01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.520
- Down! Down!
- Let's see your hands!

806
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.960
Freeze!
Put your hands on your head!

807
01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.320
Hands up!

808
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.800
Hollywood, huh?

809
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.320
On the ground! On the ground!

810
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.920
Do not move!

811
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.480
Do not move!

812
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.680
Move again! Move again!

813
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.840
At 1:45 p.m. Today, a Sheriff's
Department bus was assaulted...

814
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.960
At 1:45 p.m. Today, a Sheriff's
Department bus was assaulted...

815
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.760
...by two suspects
armed with AK-47 s...

816
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.360
...in an attempt to break
out a jailed detainee.

817
01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.960
We are awaiting the arrival
of Alex Montel...

818
01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.560
...the international fugitive
wanted in over a dozen countries.

819
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.400
Montel is wanted on Interpol
warrants by more than...

820
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.720
...ten national governments,
including our own...

821
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.600
I will give $ 100 million
to whoever gets me out of here!

822
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.400
Let's go!

823
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.600
One hundred million dollars!

824
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.480
- 100 million sound good to me.
- Hell, yeah.

825
01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.840
Are we hot? We rolling?

826
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.680
- "An offer of"...
- "One hundred million dollars..."

827
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.000
- "An offer of $ 100 million."
- Who does this guy think he is?

828
01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.320
Hey, "ése", are you for real
or what, homes?

829
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.280
Hey, I'm talking to you, "ése"!

830
01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.240
We've been looking
for this punk a long time.

831
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.480
Busted taillight brings him down?
That's amazing.

832
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.840
The plan is to have you escort him
to a federal prison out in the desert.

833
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.840
You may want to have press
photographers meet us at the facility...

834
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.880
...soon as my boys hand him over.
It's a hell of a story.

835
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.480
Yeah, we'll pass that request
up the ladder to D.C.

836
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.800
- Good.
- Gentlemen, at 1300 hours...

837
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.880
...an L.A.P.D. Helicopter will arrive
to transport the defendant.

838
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.520
Until we get him inside
a federal facility, he's our baby.

839
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.720
Sgt. Howard, your team's
got the high ground.

840
01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.680
- Yes, sir.
- Sgt. Hondo.

841
01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.920
Your boys are gonna provide close
proximity protection for the prisoner.

842
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.680
- Copy that.
- Sgt. Yamoto.

843
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.200
You're gonna set up a perimeter
around Parker Center.

844
01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.480
- I'm on it.
- Piece of cake.

845
01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.040
Roger, 10-David,
we're coming out.

846
01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.320
Okay, guys, let's get this frog
in the bird.

847
01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.600
What's $ 100 million
six ways, Box?

848
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.720
Sixteen-something.

849
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.280
Man, I'd have floor seats at the Lakers,
put my kids through college...

850
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.920
...hire Halle Berry
as my yoga instructor.

851
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.520
- Match engine power.
- RPMs match.

852
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.360
Gear down now.

853
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.000
Cover!

854
01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.280
We've been hit! We've been hit!

855
01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.760
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Did anybody see where it came from?

856
01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:48.240
- Hit second engine. Going down.
- Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!

857
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.320
Down!

858
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.640
Everybody okay?

859
01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.200
- T.J., Sanchez, take the suspect, go!
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

860
01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.960
70-David to 114!
We're coming in!

861
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.040
- Come here.
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

862
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.240
Jim! Jim! Street! Keep it together,
buddy. Keep it together.

863
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.360
- Keep it together.
- Shut up!

864
01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.120
Knock it off. We don't have time
for your personal shit.

865
01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.320
- Move him out. Let's move!
- Let's go.

866
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.920
Move!

867
01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.560
You tell them we're under attack!

868
01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.800
An L.A.P.D. Airship is down. How do
you want us to proceed at this point?

869
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.560
- What the hell happened?
- Somebody shot our bird down.

870
01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.800
No shit. How?

871
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.520
My guess is big-bore rifle, .50 caliber.
Somebody who knows how to use it.

872
01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.000
- We're at a whole new level here.
- So where the hell is the shooter?

873
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.240
I want this asshole out of here now.

874
01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.320
Best bet's to keep him on lockdown till
we see who we're dealing with.

875
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.800
- Capt. Fuller?
- Yes.

876
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.480
I've got the chief of police
on the phone for you.

877
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.080
So now we're talking about my ass.

878
01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.680
You draw up a plan, you execute it,
and do not screw this up.

879
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.600
Have it transferred to my office.

880
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.240
Can't believe how much grief that
frog's $ 100 million offer's bringing us.

881
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.400
You guys ready?
You know what you gotta do?

882
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.560
- Yes, sir.
- Where's T.J.?

883
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.400
I'm right here, Hondo. Sorry, man.
Had some bad Thai food last night.

884
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.280
- It's not sitting well with me.
- So are you good to go or what?

885
01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.040
No, I'm good now.

886
01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.160
Let's go make the captain
look like a hero.

887
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.280
- Be safe out there.
- Headed to the bird.

888
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.840
All right, we're moving out.

889
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.480
Let's load them up!

890
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.400
Time to go.

891
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.800
Put that on.

892
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.160
Marry me! Marry me, Alex!

893
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.960
Marry me!

894
01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.320
Marry me!

895
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.520
Hey!

896
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680
Come on!

897
01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.000
Oh, shit. Hold it. Hey, come on now,
get out of the damn street!

898
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.040
Wait there. Come on now!

899
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.200
Alex, let's go!

900
01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.040
Get down! Get down now!

901
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.960
- Get on the ground! Move!
- Keep your hands on your head!

902
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.320
- Hands up!
- Don't move!

903
01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.400
I got him!

904
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.280
I don't know, talk to them.
Try to make it work.

905
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.160
Look, I've had enough problems
for one day, you know?

906
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.760
- Hey, where's Mike?
- Family emergency.

907
01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.320
- Let me know if you need anything.
- All right.

908
01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.240
Just try to get us there alive,
for starters.

909
01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.000
- My sister's dating some new guy.
- Yeah?

910
01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.400
Yeah, I met him for the first time
the other night.

911
01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.080
Good for her.

912
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.880
Not really.
He's kind of a knucklehead.

913
01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.280
You should give her a call,
you know, if you want.

914
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.720
All right, yeah. Maybe I will.

915
01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.640
- Word our motorcade has been hit.
- Any damage?

916
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.880
- "Terry Fargas is dead."
- Damn!

917
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.280
- What's your location, 10-David?
- Right on top of you.

918
01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.920
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.

919
01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.040
T.J., stay alert back there.
They're coming out of the woodwork.

920
01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.920
- American greed.
- Shut up.

921
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.360
- So reliable.
- Shut up!

922
01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.600
Another officer's dead
because you shot your mouth off.

923
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.240
- That's how I like cops, dead.
- Want to join him?

924
01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.520
He knew the dangers, no?

925
01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.480
That's why he signed up
to be a police officer.

926
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.000
Carry a gun in the Wild West.
Like you, cowboy.

927
01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.800
Would you be sitting here
if this job wasn't dangerous?

928
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.680
Anyway...

929
01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.440
...killing him probably
got you 20 new recruits.

930
01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.040
You should thank me.

931
01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.280
Yeah, you're right. I should.

932
01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.920
- Boxer, thank him for me, will you?
- Love to.

933
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.120
Roger, Hondo, I see it.

934
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.640
...at checkpoint one.

935
01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:32.040
- Hardcore, Sanchez.
- I'm watching everyone's hands.

936
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.880
Empty hand, no weapon,
I'm going home to my little girl, Deke.

937
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.120
I'm going home to my brats too.

938
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.720
T.J., relax, man.

939
01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.200
Hondo transported the president like
this back in '96. No one had a clue.

940
01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.920
Hey, my friends.
I can double my offer.

941
01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.560
Sixty-six million for each of you.

942
01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.640
All you have to do
is let me go right here.

943
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.600
And don't worry.
I'll find my way home.

944
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.400
You got the cash?
Because we don't take a check.

945
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.000
Come on. Be smart about this.
What do you make?

946
01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.880
Sixty-six thousand a year?

947
01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.080
Not even with overtime.

948
01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.480
Loser.

949
01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.680
Making the turn at checkpoint two.

950
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.040
My view of Car Two
has been blocked.

951
01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.760
T.J., what's happening?

952
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.040
Roger that.

953
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.960
Hands where I can see them, guys.
Come on.

954
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.360
- T.J., what the hell are you doing?
- What the hell does it look like?

955
01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.320
I'm taking Frenchie here
up on his offer.

956
01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.160
Now, you guys just be smart.
Hands up, Box! Come on. Come on.

957
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.560
Hands up! Hands up, Box. Let's go,
let me see it. Hands up! Let's go!

958
01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.240
What the hell was that?

959
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.800
- What was that, Bri?
- He was going for his piece.

960
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.640
No, he wasn't! I had it under control!

961
01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.360
- You didn't have to shoot him!
- What do you say, Jimbo?

962
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.440
- Want to be a cowboy?
- T.J., Street, Boxer!

963
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.000
- "Car Two, respond!"
- We're catching up to you, sarge.

964
01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.200
- We'll be there in about...
- Officer down! 7 th and Hope!

965
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.760
- Flip a bitch!
- Flipping a bitch.

966
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.840
- 10-David!
- Move!

967
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.600
10-David! Do you have a location
on car number two?

968
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.200
- Move! Move! Move!
- Roger.

969
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.480
Car Two is stopped at 7 th and Hope.

970
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.320
Do me a favor. Tell Fuller
it was me who pulled this off, yeah?

971
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.720
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this, Gamble.

972
01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.160
Well, you ain't got a say
in the matter, do you?

973
01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.120
T.J., don't do this!

974
01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.200
I got an officer down! Officer down!
7 th and Hope!

975
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.200
Suspects are entering
the Pershing Square MTA station.

976
01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.520
- Boxer, hang in there! Hang in there.
- You okay?

977
01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.640
I'm all right. Boxer got hit.

978
01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.680
We're gonna need an ambulance!

979
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.880
- Who did this?
- It was Gamble.

980
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.600
- Box!
- Get him up. Get him over!

981
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.000
It was T.J. And Gamble.
They've gone down the subway.

982
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.040
Let's go hunting.

983
01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.600
- I'm gonna get the kit!
- Take care of him.

984
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.880
- Yeah.
- Street, let's go!

985
01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.840
This is 73-David. This is 73-David.
I need an RA unit...

986
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.600
...as soon as possible
to the corner of Hope and 7 th.

987
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.080
Officer down! I repeat, officer down!

988
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.120
All right, T., we're in.

989
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.680
Hit the juice, grandpa.

990
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.640
Come on, Box.

991
01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.800
Come on, come on, come on!

992
01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.880
- What do we got?
- Gunshot wound to the neck.

993
01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.520
- Vitals?
- None.

994
01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.560
Come on! Let's go!

995
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.600
Always one step behind.

996
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.800
This is 70-David at 7 th and Hope.

997
01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.320
Suspects are on eastbound train
number 5-0-7...

998
01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.720
...headed to Metro Center
at 7 th and Figueroa.

999
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.520
...and shut it down at the next station.
- Roger that, 70-David.

1000
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.920
What are they gonna do, take
the subway all the way to Mexico?

1001
01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.440
Come on,
check for secondary wounds.

1002
01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.160
73-David, we copy.

1003
01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.120
You better be good for it.

1004
01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.360
I assure you, if anyone is, it's me.

1005
01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.520
I want you to set up a perimeter.

1006
01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.320
Nobody comes in the station
and nobody gets off a train.

1007
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.160
Yes, sir. You got it.

1008
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.960
- Are you ready to stop that train?
- "Yes, sir."

1009
01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.520
- Where's this train?
- Never made it.

1010
01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:57.920
Should've been here by now.

1011
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.680
Sanchez to Hondo.
The train never made it to Figueroa.

1012
01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.480
Secure the station. SWAT's got it.

1013
01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.280
Got people. Hands up!
Let me see your hands! Now!

1014
01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.840
Hands. Hands!

1015
01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.120
Hands. Show him your hands.
Hands.

1016
01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.640
Where are they?

1017
01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.160
- They said they were gonna kill me.
- They're not coming back.

1018
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.680
Down the shaft.

1019
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.280
Where'd they go?

1020
01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.560
10-David, this is 70-David.

1021
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.320
Suspects have entered
what appears to be a storm drain...

1022
01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.800
...approximately a quarter-mile
north of Metro Center.

1023
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.000
We'll deploy above ground
accordingly.

1024
01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.960
We're going in after them.

1025
01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.560
This shaft intersects
with the storm-drain system.

1026
01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.080
They could pop out of any manhole
in a five-mile radius.

1027
01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.960
- How many manholes are we talking?
- 6000.

1028
01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.920
Six thousand?! I can't cover 6000...

1029
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.560
R-Commander, 10-David.

1030
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.200
...a command post
at Sixth and Hope Street.

1031
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.800
And give me a landline, Code Two.

1032
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.880
70-David to 10-David.

1033
01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.400
70-David to 10-David.

1034
01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.960
70-David to 114.
Do you read me?

1035
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.960
70-David to 114.
Do you read me?

1036
01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.720
We got no reception
down here.

1037
01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.520
Gamble wants us on an island...

1038
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.440
...he's got it.

1039
01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.040
Stay alert, guys.

1040
01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.320
They went this way.

1041
01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.760
- "We have ID'd those suspects."
- Great! Who are they?

1042
01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.280
Former Officer Gamble
and Officer T.J. McCabe.

1043
01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.600
Gamble, as in Street's
ex-partner Gamble?

1044
01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.840
There is some kind
of plan here, right?

1045
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.160
There's your plan, pumpkin.

1046
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.800
We have got two SWAT-trained
guys leading this attack.

1047
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.680
How do we know the rest
aren't in on it?

1048
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.760
Because I can vouch for Hondo.

1049
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.560
Willing to bet $ 100 million on that?

1050
01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.680
Bingo.

1051
01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.680
You gotta be shitting me.

1052
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.640
If they're good, this is only gonna
slow them down, T.J.

1053
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.080
This was supposed to be simple
snatch and extract.

1054
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.880
- Boxer was a threat.
- He was my friend!

1055
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.240
- He was mine too!
- Stop crying, you can buy new friends.

1056
01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.480
Don't give me any more reasons
to kill you.

1057
01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.440
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

1058
01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.920
You should relax a little bit, my friend.
I'm the money here. Don't forget it.

1059
01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.040
We don't have time for this shit.

1060
01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.400
Look, you can go ahead.
I know this sucks.

1061
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.880
Let's worry about it in paradise,
all right?

1062
01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040
Come on.

1063
01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.240
Have we re-established
contact with Hondo?

1064
01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.120
Not yet, sir. 70-David,
advise your location, please.

1065
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.720
70-David, come in.

1066
01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.440
Hondo, where the hell are you?

1067
01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.000
What's that?

1068
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.240
- It's phosphorescent paint.
- Oh, yeah?

1069
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.680
Keep your eyes on the wall
for more.

1070
01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.840
- Gas masks?
- It's just smoke.

1071
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.280
We're gonna have to go in blind.

1072
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.200
What's going on?

1073
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.960
Tripwire. Live mine.

1074
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.960
- Whoa, claymore. Nasty stuff.
- No shit.

1075
01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.680
There's an old Indian saying:

1076
01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.440
Where there's one white man...

1077
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.520
There's more white men.

1078
01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.640
What? Do you hear something?

1079
01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:41.840
No. That's the problem.

1080
01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.960
Come on, we gotta move.

1081
01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.520
- You all smell like shit.
- That would be a sewer.

1082
01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.960
- Where's our air?
- On track and on schedule.

1083
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.680
Wonderful.

1084
01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.920
T.J., ride with me.

1085
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.640
Come on, guys, gotta go!

1086
01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:14.000
Residents report beacon lights
turned on after closing hours.

1087
01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.880
Dispatch, R-Commander.
Deploy all available units...

1088
01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.160
...to Hawthorne Airport.
Call the FAA for details.

1089
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.040
They're gonna fly him
out of the country.

1090
01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.960
10-David, this is R-Commander. Get
your men there as soon as possible.

1091
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.320
Unit One, what's your status?

1092
01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:32.920
We are approximately 45 miles
due east of Point Bravo.

1093
01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.480
We have begun our descent.
That's a six-minute ETA.

1094
01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.880
- Ain't this a bitch?
- A cold, hard one.

1095
01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:09.280
- Street! How about the claymore?
- Shit! I'll be back. Deke!

1096
01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.440
We have established a perimeter
around the airport.

1097
01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.360
Additional SWAT units
are en route.

1098
01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.800
Van One, Van Two, you have
less than five minutes.

1099
01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.480
Roger that, 10-David.
Any word from Hondo's team?

1100
01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:07.800
- 70-David is still out of radio contact.
- Hondo, you son of a bitch!

1101
01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:10.040
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1102
01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.960
Remember when you asked me
what I used to do in the SEALs?

1103
01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.880
Oh, yeah.

1104
01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.320
All right, clear.

1105
01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.360
Fire in the hole.

1106
01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.000
70-David, where the hell are you?

1107
01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.800
We are somewhere around
Sixth and Trenton.

1108
01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.680
We lost communication in the tunnels.
Where's our backup?

1109
01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.840
Hawthorne Airport.
That's where your friends...

1110
01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.600
...Gamble and T.J. McCabe
are headed.

1111
01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.040
That's the other side of town!
Send a couple units to pick us up.

1112
01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:03.400
- "I got a good mind to bring you in."
- Like hell. Come on, let's go.

1113
01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.160
- Police! Stop the car!
- Stop the vehicle!

1114
01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.560
- Stop the car!
- Stop the car!

1115
01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.840
Stop the car!
Exit the car, sir!

1116
01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.800
- You guys have to get out of here.
- Police emergency.

1117
01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.880
- Wait, I just have kids in the car.
- Well, get them out of there!

1118
01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.840
- It's us in the gun cage tomorrow.
- You know how it is, Street.

1119
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.160
Sometimes doing the right thing
ain't doing the right thing.

1120
01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.640
- Last car through. Bridge is locked.
- Copy that.

1121
01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.680
- I thought you couldn't drive.
- I said I didn't like to.

1122
01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.520
Keep getting into accidents.

1123
01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.360
Sounds like they're trying
to fly him out of here.

1124
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.840
Why would they turn on the lights
and warn everybody?

1125
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.080
Shit! Gamble's smarter than that.

1126
01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.880
There's a full moon. A rookie
could land on a night like this.

1127
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.200
- So why'd they pop up back there?
- I don't know.

1128
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.280
But Fuller's sending all we got
to Hawthorne.

1129
01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:26.440
Did they build a new airport in
downtown in the past couple of days?

1130
01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.360
I don't think so, Sanchez.
Why?

1131
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.320
That jet to your right, it's flying
pretty low, and it's only getting lower.

1132
01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.400
- That's our boy! That's our boy!
- He's setting down.

1133
01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.120
- Yeah, but where?
- I don't know, but follow that jet.

1134
01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.360
- How wide is the Sixth Street Bridge?
- It's gotta be four lanes across...

1135
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.240
...sidewalks.
Plane small enough...

1136
01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.880
...he might be able to set it down,
if he's got the balls.

1137
01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.640
Reducing speed.

1138
01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.120
This is 70-David. That plane's
not coming to Hawthorne.

1139
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.760
I gave you a direct order
to stand down, sergeant.

1140
01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:31.320
...except I saw a Learjet about to land
on the Sixth Street Bridge.

1141
01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.160
- Give me 40 percent flaps.
- Forty percent flaps, check.

1142
01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.280
Sir, we have reports of a low-flying
aircraft in the downtown area.

1143
01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.920
- Where's the nearest backup?
- Five, six minutes.

1144
01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.720
I don't think you're feeling me
on this, Tom. We're going in.

1145
01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.080
Oh, God!

1146
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.880
- Reverse thrust.
- Roger that. Full brake.

1147
01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.960
This guy's worth every penny.

1148
01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.120
All right, let's turn this plane around.

1149
01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.920
They what?

1150
01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.320
Let's mount up!

1151
01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.160
All right, give me a car
downstairs now.

1152
01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.560
- What? What's going on?
- Just got room for one of you.

1153
01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:16.320
- I'm not going without my wife!
- Well then, don't.

1154
01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.440
No! No, no, no. Richard!

1155
01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.960
- Jesus Christ!
- Richard! Richard...

1156
01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.440
Richard is gone,
so sit down and shut up!

1157
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.880
Twenty seconds!
See you in Margaritaville.

1158
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.160
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Please, just let me go.

1159
01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.840
- Please, let me go!
- Shut her up!

1160
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.920
- Come on!
- Shut the hell up!

1161
01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.960
Get us in the air.

1162
01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.720
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go home.

1163
01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.480
Oh, look. They've got
their own airport security.

1164
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.880
You've got company!
Limo broke containment!

1165
01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.080
All right, we got you covered, man.

1166
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.400
Just keep coming.

1167
01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:12.960
Boom.

1168
01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.640
Son of a bitch!

1169
01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.960
Here.

1170
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.920
- What's this?
- Well, that'd be a cell phone.

1171
01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:33.440
That's the account where
I want the money transferred.

1172
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.360
The bank verifies the transfer,
goddamn if you ain't a free man.

1173
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.400
All right, you heard the man.

1174
01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.960
- Deke!
- Yo!

1175
01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.680
They get that plane off the ground,
those hostages are dead.

1176
01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:47.640
I need your A-game,
boys and girl.

1177
01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.600
- What's going on?
- Get them off our asses!

1178
01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.320
Just fly the plane. Open the hatch.

1179
01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.440
- Come on!
- Open the hatch!

1180
01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.360
Hang on!
Here's where watching...

1181
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.000
I got no shot!

1182
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.280
Get this thing in the air!

1183
01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:29.680
Come on!

1184
01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:33.360
Shut that goddamn door!

1185
01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.360
- Damn it!
- I hope you got a plan B, brother.

1186
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.080
You stay there. You're fine.

1187
01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.840
- Gamble! Let her go!
- Take a shot, Jimbo!

1188
01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.720
- Sanchez is down!
- Sanchez.

1189
01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.600
Go get him.

1190
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.200
Give me more ammo!

1191
01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.120
Deke! Frog's running!

1192
01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.640
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right, man.

1193
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.960
- Sorry, ma'am. I gotta go too.
- No.

1194
01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.760
Tell Daddy how you want it.

1195
01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.640
You're like a goddamn rash!

1196
01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.680
You might want to
get that looked at, brother.

1197
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.480
- How's Boxer?
- What do you care?

1198
01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.680
Come on, Hondo. Just give me that.

1199
01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:35.960
He's gonna make it.

1200
01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.280
Good.

1201
01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.840
Just couldn't resist, could you?

1202
01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.840
So, what do you want to do?

1203
01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.280
Goddamn it, sarge.

1204
01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.920
There's one in the chamber, partner.

1205
01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.640
Come on.

1206
01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:37.040
- So how's Boxer?
- Got word he's gonna pull through.

1207
01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.800
That's great.

1208
01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:42.320
Remind me to buy
some shares in KEVLAR.

1209
01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.440
Good work, Sanchez.

1210
01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:47.240
You look like you need a Band-Aid.

1211
01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.680
Somebody else
needs a body bag downstairs.

1212
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.880
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1213
01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:55.880
- Good stuff.
- Nice job.

1214
01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.280
Don't sound so happy.

1215
01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.760
Still got a problem.
He's still here.

1216
01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.240
Road trip?

1217
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.920
- Road trip.
- Yeah.

1218
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:17.400
Road trip. Guess you'll
have to fire us later.

1219
01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:29.040
Transferring custody
of L.A. Police Department prisoner...

1220
01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.440
...number 109672
into federal custody.

1221
01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:35.640
Thank you, sir.
I will accept the transfer.

1222
01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.440
Enjoy your new home.

1223
01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.040
Try your best
to get to know the guys.

1224
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.000
Yeah, 100 mil ought to buy you
a nice husband in there.

1225
01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.160
Where to, boys?

1226
01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:17.960
Home sounds like a winner.

1227
01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.280
Girls like you get guys
like me in trouble.

1228
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.400
You think I should've taken
the 100 million?

1229
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.600
Technically, our watch
has been over for 12 hours.

1230
01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.360
So?

1231
01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:43.800
Yeah.

1232
01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.080
What the hell.

1233
01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.440
Mount up!

1234
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
The enD
