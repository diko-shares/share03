- Who is that?

858
00:59:14.971 --> 00:59:16.139
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

he goes way up there, up top.

No, Ice Pick Paul, he's a fucking soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.

JONES: That's Benny the Bishop.

869
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:40.163
That guy is a soldier. This guy's
a lieutenant. No way that guy's on top.

873

Hey, which one of you guys has ever
actually seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

874
00:59:50.131 --> 00:59:51.591
Actually seen it go down?

875
00:59:52.327 --> 00:59:55.705
Yeah, seen it go down.

we can take him off the fucking board.

880

I don't think we got any
solid evidence on anybody on that board.

This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

I'm saying, take it down.
We got to start again from the street.

883

one year's salary, Richie.

I will not be able to get it for you again.

Did a lot of things. He was a friend
and served New York. New York served him.

He taught me a lot of things. He

964
01:05:34.393 --> 01:05:36.645
taught me how to take my time.

965
01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:42.651
Taught me that if I was going to do
something, to do it with care, with love.

966
01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:44.486
Anything else?

967

01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:27.357
Okay, I understand.

1020
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.486
They ask me, I'll tell them what you
want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1021
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.780
No, don't lie. You don't have to lie.

1022
01:08:33.864 --> 01:08:37.033
Just, omit certain details.

1023
01:08:37.742 --> 01:08:39.452
Sure. All right.

1024
01:08:41.746 --> 01:08:43.832
You know, there's something else
I was gonna ask you.

1025
01:08:43.874 --> 01:08:47.669
- Something else.
- You don't have to answer if you don't want.

1026
01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:51.756
Blue Magic. Anything?

1027
01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:58.096
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work, that's all.

1028
01:08:59.431 --> 01:09:00.682
What, your guys?

1029
01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:02.058
Just guys.

1030
01:09:03.518 --> 01:09:06.354
You thinking about where it's coming from?

1031
01:09:06.396 --> 01:09:08.940
Guys down south. That's all I heard.

1032
01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:11.401
- Cubans?
- I don't know.

1033
01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:13.862
Not Mexico.

1034
01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:15.697
I don't know.

1035
01:09:16.114 --> 01:09:18.241
You're telling me,
it's coming in from South America?

1036
01:09:18.366 --> 01:09:19.910
I don't know.

1037
01:09:20.744 --> 01:09:25.707
All'| can tell you is whoever it is, they're
upsetting the natural order of things.

1038
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:27.709

Frank, I want you to meet Mike Sobota.

1043
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.737
- How are you doing, Mr. Sobota?
- How are you?

1044
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.863
What can I get you?

1045
01:11:19.946 --> 01:11:22.032
How about a left-hander?
From what Charlie tells me, your nephew.

1046
01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:25.368
- Oh, this is the... Yankees, yeah. Hey, Steve!
- Yankees.

1047
01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:26.953
- Steve! Come here.
- Excuse me one second.

1048
01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:28.913
This boy's good, okay?
I want you to put him on the Yankees.

1049
01:11:28.997 --> 01:11:30.081
"Cause you good enough, ain't you?

1050
01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:32.333
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on a bad day, Jack.

1051
01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.169
He's good enough on a bad day,

1056
01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:47.474
- Taking your ass in.
- Where are the handcuffs?

1057
01:11:47.515 --> 01:11:49.559

Wait a minute, I got this for you.
You ain't got to arrest nobody.

1064
01:12:04.157 --> 01:12:05.867
Are you bribing me now?

1065
01:12:05.909 --> 01:12:08.536
I'll tell you what, I'm
arresting everybody!

What was that?

1071

- Come on, guys.
- What's the matter with you, man?

1072

- I said, what the hell was that?
- What was what?

1073

- I said what the hell are you doing, man?
- Be cool, man!

1074
01:12:23.927 --> 01:12:25.178
What's your fucking problem?

1075
01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.013
What the hell's wrong with you?

- FRANK: It wasn't no goddamn accident.
- He feels terrible.

1084
01:12:56.793 --> 01:13:00.505
He don't feel shit, 'cause
he's coked up all the motherfucking time!

1085
01:13:00.588 --> 01:13:02.757
He's your driver. Get rid of him.

Come on, man, that's your cousin!

1087
01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:06.052
That ain't shit to me!
He don't mean nothing to me.

- What's he gonna do, go back home?
- I don't give a damn what he does!

Hey! Don't rub on that! You blot that!
You understand? That's alpaca!

1091
01:13:14.561 --> 01:13:18.064
That's $25,000 alpaca! You blot that shit!

1092

You don't rub it! Put
the club soda on there.

Listen, from now on, don't nobody
talk to me directly! You understand?

1095
01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:29.492
You got business with me, you talk to Huey!
Huey, you talk to me! You got it?

1096
01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:32.078
- All right.
- Damn it, never on the phone! You got it?

1097
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.413
- I got it.
- All right!

1098
01:13:33.454 --> 01:13:35.915
And take them goddamn sunglasses off.

1099
01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:37.584
Take the goddamn sunglasses off!

1100
01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:39.252
Damn it, man.

1101
01:13:41.462 --> 01:13:43.840
Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.

1102
01:13:59.314 --> 01:14:01.816
The whole place was imported.

1103
01:14:02.233 --> 01:14:03.818
Brick by brick.

1104

Gloucestershire.

1105

- Who?
- Great Britain.

1106
01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:11.284
Yours.

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:23.379
Pull!

1109
01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:30.678
Come, Eva.

1110
01:14:31.512 --> 01:14:34.807
I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.

1111
01:14:38.311 --> 01:14:40.855
Of course. Excuse me.

1112
01:14:42.023 --> 01:14:45.235
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1113
01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:51.157
What do you think of monopolies?

1114
01:14:52.367 --> 01:14:53.534
You mean like the game?

1115
01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.330
No, I just think monopolies
were made illegal in the country, Frank,

1116
01:14:57.372 --> 01:14:59.666
'cause nobody wants to compete, you know.

1117
01:14:59.707 --> 01:15:02.752
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1118
01:15:02.877 --> 01:15:05.505
I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that,

1119
01:15:05.546 --> 01:15:07.590
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1120
01:15:07.715 --> 01:15:09.217
Just trying to make a living.

1121
01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:13.846
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right. It's America.

1122
01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:18.393
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.

1123
01:15:18.726 --> 01:15:20.853
'Cause then it becomes un-American.

1124
01:15:20.895 --> 01:15:22.939
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1125
01:15:23.022 --> 01:15:24.816
could never represent
the true cost of production

1126
01:15:24.899 --> 01:15:29.404
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1127
01:15:29.487 --> 01:15:32.031
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that I think is fair.

1128
01:15:32.073 --> 01:15:33.408
- I don't think it's fair.
- You don't?

1129
01:15:33.491 --> 01:15:34.993
- I don't think it's fair.
- I think it's fair.

1130
01:15:35.076 --> 01:15:37.078
I mean, I know
your customers are happy, Frank,

1131
01:15:37.161 --> 01:15:39.914
bunch of fucking junkies that they are.

1132
01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:44.544
But we fellow dairy farmers out
here, Frank, are you thinking of us?

1133
01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:47.005
You thinking of them?

1134
01:15:47.088 --> 01:15:49.132
- The dairy farmers?
- Yeah.

1135
01:15:49.215 --> 01:15:54.012
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've ever thought about me.

1136
01:15:54.095 --> 01:15:56.431
I'm just thinking out loud now.

1137
01:15:56.931 --> 01:16:01.269
If you took some of your inventory, Frank,
and you sold it wholesale...

1138
01:16:03.271 --> 01:16:04.314
Sit.

1139
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:08.568
We could work.
We could do some distribution.

1140
01:16:09.944 --> 01:16:11.279
I don't know. I'm pretty good, Dominic.

1141
01:16:11.362 --> 01:16:15.366
You know, I got 110th,
155th, river to river. I'm all right.

1142
01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:18.411
That's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what I'm talking about.

1143
01:16:18.453 --> 01:16:20.121
I mean, let's go at
least bigger than Kmart.

1144
01:16:20.204 --> 01:16:25.126
I'm talking about LA, Chicago, Detroit,
Las Vegas. Let's go nationwide, huh?

1145
01:16:25.543 --> 01:16:29.964
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace
of mind here. You don't want that?

1146
01:16:31.215 --> 01:16:33.176
You're going to need it.

1147
01:16:33.509 --> 01:16:35.178
I don't know how you view me, you know.

1148
01:16:35.261 --> 01:16:37.138
I'm kind of a Renaissance man, Frank.

1149
01:16:37.221 --> 01:16:39.223
You know,
the people I deal with on a daily basis,

1150
01:16:39.307 --> 01:16:41.184
you know, they're not enlightened, Frank.

1151
01:16:41.267 --> 01:16:44.062
You talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.

1152
01:16:44.145 --> 01:16:45.772
They're not open to change.

1153
01:16:45.813 --> 01:16:49.359
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.

1154
01:16:49.567 --> 01:16:52.779
I talk to them,
there's just no misunderstandings.

1155
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.325
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.

1156
01:17:01.954 --> 01:17:04.999
You're paying, what,
$75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

1157
01:17:07.293 --> 01:17:09.462
I'm a Renaissance man, too.

1158
01:17:10.588 --> 01:17:12.465
I'll consider $50,000.

1159
01:17:21.182 --> 01:17:24.435
Why would you trust these people?
And the way they look at you...

1160
01:17:24.519 --> 01:17:26.896
They look at me like
it's Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.

1161
01:17:26.979 --> 01:17:29.524
They look at us like we're the help.

1162
01:17:30.316 --> 01:17:32.193
They work for me now.

02:01:42.178 --> 02:01:43.345
If there was heroin on board,

1840
02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:45.264
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

1841
02:01:45.347 --> 02:01:49.852
Which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

1842
02:01:49.894 --> 02:01:52.313
the military is smuggling narcotics.

1843
02:01:52.354 --> 02:01:55.024
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

1844
02:01:55.107 --> 02:01:56.817
That someone employed by this office

1845
02:01:56.859 --> 02:02:00.446
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

1846
02:02:00.529 --> 02:02:03.908
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the remains of young men

1847
02:02:03.991 --> 02:02:06.911
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

1848
02:02:06.994 --> 02:02:09.538
- There is dope on that plane.
- Shut the fuck up!

1849
02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:14.418
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

1850
02:02:14.502 --> 02:02:16.712
the entire federal narcotics program
IS now in jeopardy

1851
02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:19.799
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically

1852
02:02:19.882 --> 02:02:21.717
as that fucking transport plane?

1853
02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:24.345
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr. Roberts, single-handedly.

1854
02:02:24.386 --> 02:02:26.514
I had good information.

1855
02:02:26.555 --> 02:02:30.101
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

1856
02:02:30.184 --> 02:02:32.103
- And that target is?
- Frank Lucas.

1857
02:02:32.186 --> 02:02:34.313
- Who?
- His name's Frank Lucas.

1858
02:02:34.396 --> 02:02:36.982
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for? Which family?

1859
02:02:37.066 --> 02:02:39.151
He's not Italian. He's black.

1860
02:02:39.235 --> 02:02:40.611
(LAUGHS)

1861
02:02:42.446 --> 02:02:45.366
Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

1862
02:02:45.407 --> 02:02:47.701
You're this close to the end of your career
in law enforcement

1863
02:02:47.743 --> 02:02:50.412
and you're making fucking jokes?

1864
02:02:50.454 --> 02:02:52.790
My investigation indicates

1865
02:02:52.915 --> 02:02:56.335
that Frank Lucas is above the Mafia
in the dope business.

1866
02:02:56.418 --> 02:02:57.962
My investigations also indicate

1867
02:02:58.045 --> 02:03:02.258
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

1868
02:03:02.299 --> 02:03:05.469
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

1869
02:03:05.594 --> 02:03:09.431
and personnel to transport
pure number 4 heroin into the United States

1870
02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:13.602
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

1871
02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:16.605
I have cases against
every member of Frank's organization.

1872
02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:17.815
Frank's organization?

1873
02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:21.735

what the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!
