[MAGGOTT COUGHING]

337
00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:44.923
The all-American hero,
laughing in the face of death.

338
00:23:50.887 --> 00:23:53.598
They're not gonna hang me, major.

339
00:23:55.516 --> 00:23:58.394
I never raped that evil slut...

340
00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:02.523
...or any other creature.

341
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.360
The Lord gave me that woman
and told me to chastise her.

342
00:24:05.568 --> 00:24:07.695
Then he told you to beat her
to death, huh?

343
00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:10.323
I only do what I'm called on to do.

344
00:24:12.283 --> 00:24:17.121
I was in a state of grace.
And that woman...

345
00:24:17.288 --> 00:24:19.040
...she tried to soil my spirit.

346
00:24:19.248 --> 00:24:21.209
Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.

347
00:24:21.417 --> 00:24:24.796
But it seems to me I remember
a quotation that goes like:

348
00:24:25.004 --> 00:24:26.214
Vengeance is mine.

349
00:24:28.257 --> 00:24:32.845
Vengeance is mine.
I will repay, sayeth the Lord.

350
00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:35.848
Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.

351
00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:39.185
Exactly. Now, isn't that
supposed to mean...

352
00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:42.355
...that we leave punishment
of the transgressors to his hands?

353
00:24:42.563 --> 00:24:46.693
That's right, major.
That's exactly what it means.

354
00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:51.197
But it doesn't restrict him to the kind
of tools he would use, now does it?

355
00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:55.451
And like I told you, major,
I only do what I'm called on to do.

356
00:24:56.202 --> 00:24:59.288
You know, Maggott, I don't think
you're going to hang after all.

357
00:25:01.874 --> 00:25:06.504
I think a man like you is destined
for higher things. Guard.

358
00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:16.305
Besides, us Southern boys have
to stick together now, don't we?

359
00:25:22.937 --> 00:25:25.231
POSEY:
I sure didn't mean to kill that fella.

360
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.693
But you do like I say,
and maybe they won't hang you.

361
00:25:28.901 --> 00:25:31.904
Fixing to kill me some other way?

362
00:25:32.113 --> 00:25:33.656
It might not come to that.

363
00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:38.411
I reckon the folks would be a sight
happier if I died like a soldier.

364
00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:43.416
Can't say I would.

think he is?

If you can't find something to do,
I'll find something for you.

Now, move it.

Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.
You know why I'm here.

00:26:04.103 --> 00:26:06.939
Or maybe you think I should've let
those cracker bastards...

00:26:07.106 --> 00:26:08.775
...go right ahead and castrate me?

373

Seeing what those guys
tried to do to you...

374
00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:15.907
...I'd say that you had
considerable justification.

375
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:22.038
Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.
I really do thank you for that.

376
00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:27.835
But the court didn't agree?
So where does that leave you?

377
00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:31.297
I'm offering you an alternative,
which means you can keep fighting.

378
00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:34.217
-Who for, major?
-For yourself, if you want.

379
00:26:34.425 --> 00:26:37.553
But the Krauts,
they're the real master-race merchants.

That's your war, man, not mine.

381
00:26:39.889 --> 00:26:42.892
You don't like the Krauts,
major, you fight them.

00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:46.229

That's your privilege. But you won't
be able to exercise it much longer.

You know, sergeant, going over
the transcript of that man's trial...

389
00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:20.346
...there are a couple of things
I don't get.

390
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.100
Did he ever claim
that he didn't do it?

391
00:27:24.308 --> 00:27:28.146
I beg your pardon, but you haven't been
around prisons very much, have you?

392
00:27:28.354 --> 00:27:32.483
You see, the first thing one learns
in prison, everybody is innocent.

393
00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:36.404
This one, he doesn't say too much
about that one way or another.

394
00:27:36.612 --> 00:27:41.534
He's only disturbed because we don't
allow him to have strings for his guitar.

395
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:43.619
Sergeant, did you ever lose a man...

396
00:27:43.786 --> 00:27:46.080

with a guitar string?

No, sir, I haven't,
and I'm not about to.

You can foul up in training and be sent
back here for execution of sentence...

408

I'll blow your brains out...

in which case you might just get by.

there will be no appeal.

Any breach of either of these conditions
by any one of you...

414

<i>...means you'll all be shipped back
for immediate execution of sentence.</i>

on guard duty will help?

01:22:50.715 --> 01:22:53.301
You're damn right I am!
They might not be pretty...

1158
01:22:53.509 --> 01:22:55.887
...but any one of mine
Is worth 10 of yours.

1159
01:22:56.095 --> 01:22:59.307
-Those comparisons are hardly the point.
-It's precisely the point.

1160
01:22:59.515 --> 01:23:03.186
My contention is that my men are more
than able to handle any job given them.

1161
01:23:03.686 --> 01:23:07.064
Now, you gentlemen set this thing up.
You promised them a chance.

1162
01:23:07.231 --> 01:23:10.067
At least you can let them
show you what they're capable of.

1163
01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:12.570
I shudder to think
what they might be capable of.

1164
01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:16.574
Give them a chance to prove it, then
if they fail, your conscience is clear.

1165
01:23:17.408 --> 01:23:19.035
Tell me, major...

1166
01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:22.330
...just how would you
have your men prove it?

1167
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.126
It can't be done, can it?

1168
01:23:33.674 --> 01:23:36.511
Uh, well, yes. I suppose it could.

1169
01:23:37.553 --> 01:23:39.305
I mean, there might be a way.

1170
01:23:40.431 --> 01:23:42.767
What I mean is,
general, if you recall...

1171
01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:45.686
...next week we've got divisional
maneuvers in Devonshire.

1172
01:23:45.895 --> 01:23:47.063
Yes, yes, yes.

1173
01:23:47.271 --> 01:23:50.566
Colonel Breed's outfit will be
part of that exercise.

1174
01:23:51.067 --> 01:23:53.861
As a matter of fact,
one of his companies...

1175
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:58.115
...has been assigned the defense
of divisional headquarters.

1176
01:23:58.324 --> 01:23:59.367
So?

1177
01:24:00.785 --> 01:24:02.912
Uh, so...

1178
01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:08.042
So you let my 12 men act
as an independent unit...

1179
01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:10.378
...attached to the opposing force.

1180
01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:15.424
And they'll knock out Breed's
headquarters and capture his entire staff.

1181
01:24:17.635 --> 01:24:18.970
That I'd like to see.

1182
01:24:19.262 --> 01:24:21.222
So would I.

1183
01:24:45.288 --> 01:24:48.332
Charlie and Fox Companies will support
the back of the woods.

1184
01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:50.751
They'll need supplies
from the 2nd Battalion.

1185
01:24:50.918 --> 01:24:53.754
Rogers won't like that,
but I don't want to hear about it.

1186
01:24:53.921 --> 01:24:56.173
-Yes, sir.
-How's Johnson's armor?

1187
01:24:56.382 --> 01:24:59.677
They just ran through two minutes ago,
sir. The armor's all set.

1188
01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.103
Hold it!

1189
01:25:11.564 --> 01:25:12.815
Back!

1190
01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:16.944
Change!

1191
01:25:24.827 --> 01:25:26.996
-Go.
JEFFERSON: Move it.

1192
01:25:36.339 --> 01:25:38.507
BRAVOS: You think we're gonna
get away with this?

1193
01:25:38.966 --> 01:25:43.387
FRANKO: Smile, you idiots! If those blue
slobs recognize us, we're in trouble.

1194
01:25:47.558 --> 01:25:49.644
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

1195
01:26:02.365 --> 01:26:05.576
REISMAN: Would you believe it?
They shaved.

1196
01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:07.620
How about that?

1197
01:26:07.995 --> 01:26:10.956
JEFFERSON: Get a load of the major.
He can't believe we made it.

1198
01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:14.418
LEVER: The day go fast, major?
-You're beautiful, but you're late.

1199
01:26:14.627 --> 01:26:16.671
-Got everything you need?
-Absolutely.

1200
01:26:16.879 --> 01:26:18.964
Think you can remember the plan?

1201
01:26:19.423 --> 01:26:21.717
-So where'd you get the vehicle?
-We stole it.

1202
01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:24.345
Like we're gonna steal
everything else.

1203
01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:27.181
We're playing war games, right?
Anything else, sir?

1204
01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:31.018
I guess not. All right, we'll be
with the generals at headquarters.

1205
01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:34.188
From now on, you're on your own.
So take off and good luck.

1206
01:26:34.605 --> 01:26:36.107
Let's move!

1207
01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:40.194
All right, split up into three groups.

1208
01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.293
These two belong to you?

1209
01:27:05.594 --> 01:27:07.054
OFFICER:
Morning, sir.

1210
01:27:12.309 --> 01:27:13.686
Where's General Worden?

1211
01:27:13.894 --> 01:27:16.272
Well, he's gone to check up
in the field, sir.

1212
01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:19.275
REISMAN:
Oh, my God.

1213
01:27:27.324 --> 01:27:30.119
-Well?
-Be with you in a minute, sir.

1214
01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:38.836
-Well, how about this one?
-Yes, sir. I think that's it, sir.

1215
01:27:40.337 --> 01:27:44.091
Oh, that's excellent,
Haskell, excellent!

1216
01:27:44.967 --> 01:27:46.302
Come on, let's go.

1217
01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:06.280
WLADISLAW: We made it.
ARMBRUSTER: Where are the others?

1218
01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:09.366
WLADISLAW: 8:45. Four of them ought
to be coming over that ridge.

1219
01:28:09.575 --> 01:28:12.286
08457 They'd better
be coming fast then.

1220
01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:16.248
The enemy is gonna lay a live barrage on
that ridge at 0850. Did you know that?

1221
01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.875
Yes, sir, I knew that.

1222
01:28:18.083 --> 01:28:21.462
But that's the one direction Colonel
Breed won't be looking for them.

1223
01:28:24.131 --> 01:28:26.717
-Are they all set?
-All set, sir.

1224
01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:30.429
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

1225
01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:34.475
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

1226
01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.227
Batteries one, three and four--

1227
01:28:39.146 --> 01:28:40.815
OFFICER:
Ready!

1228
01:28:41.023 --> 01:28:42.525
Aim!

1229
01:28:42.733 --> 01:28:43.818
Fire!

1230
01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:51.951
Come on!

1231
01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:54.578
JEFFERSON:
Let's go! Come on!

1232
01:29:09.718 --> 01:29:11.345
OFFICER:
Load!

1233
01:29:13.639 --> 01:29:14.682
Now, come on!

1234
01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:17.685
-While they're reloading!
-Let's go!

1235
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.314
-Down! Can't you hear it?!
-Hit it!

1236
01:29:40.374 --> 01:29:41.750
OFFICER:
Secure guards!

1237
01:29:41.959 --> 01:29:44.003
All right, let's go!

1238
01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:52.052
Let's go.

1239
01:29:59.768 --> 01:30:01.979
Now, what the hell were you
guys waiting for?

1240
01:30:02.187 --> 01:30:05.733
What do you m--?
Mean, boy?

1241
01:30:07.359 --> 01:30:10.696
Those lovers were trying
to kill us back there.

1242
01:30:13.032 --> 01:30:14.241
Change.

1243
01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:17.828
ARMBRUSTER:
Change? What do you mean, "change"?

1244
01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:19.663
You can't do that!

1245
01:30:19.872 --> 01:30:23.000
It's all right, major.
We're gonna change back later.

1246
01:30:23.542 --> 01:30:25.502
JIMINEZ:
They can't stop us now.

1247
01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:27.338
Let's go.

1248
01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.590
Come on.

1249
01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:31.675
BRAVOS:
We're on our way.

1250
01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:44.730
WLADISLAW:
We get across this road, take 10.

1251
01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:55.282
What are we waiting here for?

1252
01:30:55.699 --> 01:30:58.327
For a jeep, a heavy machine gun
and four men.

1253
01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.623
Like this one?

1254
01:31:03.415 --> 01:31:04.458
Slow down.

1255
01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:06.627
JEFFERSON:
Ten-hut!

1256
01:31:14.301 --> 01:31:15.844
FRANKO:
Good afternoon, general.

1257
01:31:25.562 --> 01:31:27.314
The Mafia has landed!

1258
01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.858
-What Franko says, Franko does!
WLADISLAW: Machine gun.

1259
01:31:30.025 --> 01:31:31.527
Let's get it out. Move it out.

1260
01:31:31.735 --> 01:31:33.654
BRAVOS: Come on, snap it up.
-Franko, out!

1261
01:31:34.196 --> 01:31:36.156
Out? What do you mean, "out"?

1262
01:31:36.323 --> 01:31:39.326
-Who do you think stole this thing?
-You did, my boy.

1263
01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:44.081
Look, you and Pinkley are the only guys
that Colonel Breed got a good look at.

1264
01:31:44.331 --> 01:31:47.334
This operation is a big enough risk
without you coming along.

1265
01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:49.795
-Out.
-Come on, Franko.

1266
01:31:51.338 --> 01:31:54.258
Jefferson, you have until 0930
to show up with the ambulance.

1267
01:31:54.466 --> 01:31:56.677
You don't make it,
I'll figure you got nailed.

1268
01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.096
-Then we'll take a whack at plan B.
-Right.

1269
01:32:00.222 --> 01:32:01.974
So long, major.

1270
01:32:04.727 --> 01:32:07.021
Hold on, Maggott.
Don't want to lose you now.

1271
01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.567
Attention!

1272
01:32:12.943 --> 01:32:14.486
OFFICER:
Attention.

1273
01:32:16.447 --> 01:32:17.489
OFFICER 2:
Ten-hut!

1274
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.536
-Morning, Breed.
-Morning. Quite a surprise.

1275
01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:25.706
-Everything under control?
- I think you could say that, sir.

1276
01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:28.751
Good, good.
At ease, gentlemen, at ease.

1277
01:32:28.959 --> 01:32:32.254
Just thought I'd drop by to see
how things are shaping up.

1278
01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:35.007
So this is what it looks like, huh?

1279
01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:42.181
POSEY:
Come on, push!

1280
01:32:45.768 --> 01:32:48.395
-Posey, remember, you're hurt.
POSEY: Oh, I'm dying.

1281
01:32:48.604 --> 01:32:49.813
WLADISLAW:
Come on, Maggott.

1282
01:32:52.232 --> 01:32:53.817
Stand back, now.

1283
01:33:03.994 --> 01:33:06.121
SOLDIER: What's that?
SOLDIER 2: Over there!

1284
01:33:08.207 --> 01:33:11.585
-What was that?
-Down the road, sir. See that smoke?

1285
01:33:11.835 --> 01:33:14.713
-Sergeant, have somebody take a look.
-Yes, sir.

1286
01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:18.217
-What are they doing around that ridge?
- I don't know, sir.

1287
01:33:18.425 --> 01:33:21.845
That should've been cleared
half an hour ago.

1288
01:33:22.054 --> 01:33:25.349
Now, colonel, it sure doesn't look like
it's been cleared, does it?

1289
01:33:25.516 --> 01:33:26.558
WLADISLAW:
Let's go.

1290
01:33:31.438 --> 01:33:34.942
-Posey, remember, you're injured.
POSEY: Gilpin, you forgot the ketchup.

1291
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.027
GILPIN: Help!
POSEY: Come on.

1292
01:33:53.252 --> 01:33:54.920
Sir?

1293
01:33:57.631 --> 01:34:00.634
We got a man that's hurt bad.
We'd like to call an ambulance.

1294
01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:02.761
Call an ambulance.
Go see what happened.

1295
01:34:02.928 --> 01:34:05.764
-Yes, sir. Come on, you two.
BREED: Private?

1296
01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.183
-Come here.
-Yes, sir.

1297
01:34:08.392 --> 01:34:10.060
What were you doing on that road?

1298
01:34:10.269 --> 01:34:12.479
Our jeep got a flat tire.
We went into a ditch.

1299
01:34:13.564 --> 01:34:17.484
I didn't ask you that. I asked you
what you were doing on that road.

1300
01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.820
Spotting for the Field Artillery, sir.

1301
01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:25.659
WORDEN:
Let's see that map.

1302
01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.494
BREED:
Move Able, Charlie Company to...

1303
01:34:27.703 --> 01:34:29.580
...the bridge under smoke screen.

1304
01:34:29.788 --> 01:34:34.001
Baker Company bank towards
the ridge at 1420 hours.

1305
01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:37.504
-Private. Come here.
-Yes, sir.

1306
01:34:39.798 --> 01:34:41.216
What's your name and outfit?

1307
01:34:41.425 --> 01:34:42.885
Private Matthew Donald, sir.

1308
01:34:43.093 --> 01:34:48.098
Serial number 726256.
Battery B, 526th Field Artillery, sir.

1309
01:34:48.307 --> 01:34:51.310
-Where are your orders?
-Right here, sir.

1310
01:34:52.936 --> 01:34:55.189
From Captain Thornhill, sir.

1311
01:34:58.192 --> 01:35:01.028
I know most of the men
under my command.

1312
01:35:02.362 --> 01:35:04.281
But I don't recall seeing you before.

1313
01:35:04.656 --> 01:35:07.576
No, sir.
I was transferred in last week, sir.

1314
01:35:11.788 --> 01:35:15.250
We're getting congested at point B.
Two forces have mined the road.

1315
01:35:15.417 --> 01:35:17.586
BREED: Where's Peterson?
SOLDIER: Here it comes!

1316
01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.884
SOLDIER 2:
Clear the way!

1317
01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:26.136
SOLDIER 3:
Looks like somebody got hurt.

Major!

1670
02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:55.282
ARMBRUSTER: Among the many reports
of the raid on the chateau near Rennes...

1671
02:27:55.449 --> 02:27:58.285
...perhaps the most objective
is the one by General Worden...

1672
02:27:58.452 --> 02:27:59.995
...in which he states:

1673
02:28:00.162 --> 02:28:03.082
"We are recommending that those
members of the group known...

1674
02:28:03.248 --> 02:28:05.834
...as 'The Dirty Dozen' who survived
this operation...

1675
02:28:06.001 --> 02:28:08.420
...Should have their records
amended to indicate...

1676
02:28:08.587 --> 02:28:11.965
...that they are being returned
to active duty at their former ranks.

1677
02:28:12.341 --> 02:28:16.220
And that the next of kin of those
prisoners who were killed be advised...

1678
02:28:16.387 --> 02:28:19.890
...that they lost their lives
in the line of duty.”

1679
02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:21.725
You did a fine job, major.

1680
02:28:24.478 --> 02:28:25.729
I'll see you around.

1681
02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:28.524
You did a good job, soldier.

1682
