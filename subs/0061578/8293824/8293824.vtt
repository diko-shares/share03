1
00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.232
Knock it off.

2
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.317
Knock it off!

3
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:31.072
Keep telling them you're innocent.

4
00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:39.997
Don't let them see you're afraid!

5
00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:45.962
It'll be all right.

6
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:53.052
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry!

7
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.098
I didn't... Sir? Sir?

8
00:00:57.765 --> 00:00:58.766
It won't happen again.

9
00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.435
I wanted to...

10
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:24.709
Private James Gardner, you've been
found guilty of the crime of murder.

11
00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:29.130
Your case has been appealed
and reviewed three times.

12
00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:31.757
The verdict of each court-martial
is the same:

13
00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.135
Guilty as charged.

14
00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.680
Do you have anything to say
before the sentence?

15
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.434
I didn't mean it.

16
00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.812
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:51.277
I didn't mean to.

18
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.114
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.337
Open it up.

20
00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.424
Enjoy the show, major?

21
00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.955
I want to see Major Armbruster.

22
00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.625
-Just down the corridor--
- know, I know.

23
00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:52.296
John! Good to see you!

24
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.633
Don't give me that!
We had dinner last night, remember?

25
00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:01.514
Be nice. Take it easy.

26
00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:08.354
This time it's serious, John.
You've got to cooperate!

27
00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.398
Let's go.

28
00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.492
Colonel. The general is waiting, major.

29
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.960
Major Reisman, sir.

30
00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.594
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

31
00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:42.388
-Sit down, major.
-Thank you, sir.

32
00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.648
Well, major, what did you think
of the hanging?

33
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.944
Looked very efficient.
Then again, I'm not an expert.

34
00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.948
I meant, how did you personally
feel about it?

35
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.409
Not the nicest way
to spend an evening.

36
00:04:03.617 --> 00:04:06.662
Yes, but it wasn't staged
for your entertainment.

37
00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.664
I hope Private Gardner knew that.

38
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.957
Private who?

39
00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:13.169
Private Gardner.
He was the object of the exercise.

40
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.088
There was a reason, major.

41
00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.551
I've got your service record
here, major.

42
00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:25.806
Lot of fireworks. Lot of transfers.

43
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.810
One tough scrape after another,
very short on discipline.

44
00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.522
Very short on discipline.

45
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:38.068
I hear you did a good job in Italy.

46
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:42.406
You loused it up by exceeding orders.
And it's not the first time.

47
00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.910
-I didn't write those reports, sir.
-What does that mean?

48
00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:48.621
I don't necessarily agree with
what's in them.

49
00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:52.291
-Maybe you'd like to write your own?
-No, thank you, sir.

50
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:57.129
I'm not very interested in embroidery,
only results.

51
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.593
Now, you hold it right there.

52
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.971
This war was not started
for your private gratification.

53
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.976
And this Army isn't run
for your personal convenience, either.

54
00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:17.858
You've waited for a transfer
for over two months now.

55
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.237
With a record like yours,
you could go on waiting forever.

56
00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:25.491
However, I get orders too.
And right now I've got some...

57
00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.911
...that sound as if they were made
for somebody like you.

58
00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:32.164
Personally, I don't go for this
behind-the-lines nonsense.

59
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:36.252
I think a soldier's job is to wear
his uniform and kill the enemy.

60
00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:38.712
But that's another matter.

61
00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.758
I'll ask General Denton to
read these orders as they came.

62
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.678
After that,
if you have any questions, ask.

63
00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:47.096
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

64
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.269
"Project Amnesty:

65
00:05:53.477 --> 00:05:55.938
You will select 12 prisoners
sentenced to death...

66
00:05:56.105 --> 00:06:00.109
...or long imprisonment for murder,
rape or other violent crimes.

67
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:02.361
Train these prisoners in
the business...

68
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.030
...of behind-the-lines
operations in a brief...

69
00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:06.699
...but unspecified time.

70
00:06:06.907 --> 00:06:09.118
You'll deliver them secretly
to Europe...

71
00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.954
...and prior to the invasion,
destroy the target specified:

72
00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:14.790
Overleaf."

73
00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:17.877
-That's all?
-That's all.

74
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:21.881
What about the target specified,
"overleaf'?

75
00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.883
Doesn't concern you now.

76
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.051
What do you say, major?

77
00:06:26.343 --> 00:06:29.555
It confirms a suspicion I've
had for some time now, sir.

78
00:06:29.763 --> 00:06:31.974
Do you think we might share
that suspicion?

79
00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:33.267
I think you should.

80
00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:36.478
Presuming we're over here
to try to win the war...

81
00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:39.899
...it wouldn't pay to advertise
that one man we're working for...

82
00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.150
...is a lunatic.

83
00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:45.154
That's enough, major. You're here
to be briefed on an operation.

84
00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:47.948
You can ask questions
about that operation.

85
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.701
You don't have permission to make
any comments...

86
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.621
...concerning the officers
responsible for it.

87
00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:54.914
-Is that clear?
-Yes.

88
00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:57.374
Either ask relevant questions,
or shut up.

89
00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.336
Is it relevant to ask
why I'm offered this mission?

90
00:07:00.502 --> 00:07:04.256
It's not, as you say, being "offered."

91
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.841
I'm volunteering.

92
00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.385
Exactly, major.

93
00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.138
I'm glad you look at things
so realistically.

94
00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:15.559
I don't mean to seem unduly cautious,
but if my personal survival...

95
00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:18.479
...depends on the performance
of 12 deadheads...

96
00:07:18.687 --> 00:07:21.482
...it'd help to know
what I'm training them for.

97
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.443
Now, that's a very good question, major.

98
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:28.030
-Armbruster, let's have the outline.
-Yes, sir.

99
00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:33.786
"The Germans are using a chateau
near Rennes in Brittany...

100
00:07:33.994 --> 00:07:37.831
...as a rest center and conference
place for general staff officers."

101
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.292
The target has
no real military value...

102
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:44.421
...but with these conferences
and the like going on all the time...

103
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.549
...there's hardly a day when
there aren't a number...

104
00:07:47.716 --> 00:07:50.052
...of important officers in residence.

105
00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.347
Usually with the benefit
of female companionship.

106
00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:56.892
"Eliminating a number of
senior officers could have...

107
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.687
...the effect of disrupting
their chain of command."

108
00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.731
The idea is that our men
are dropped by parachute.

109
00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:08.070
They enter the chateau and kill as
many senior officers as is possible.

110
00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:13.117
Naturally, the place is fortified
and heavily guarded.

111
00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:15.953
Naturally.
What's the deal with the men?

112
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.413
None whatsoever.

113
00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:21.000
Let's have no misunderstanding.
It's what it says, an amnesty.

114
00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:24.712
A temporary postponement.
You take it or leave it on that basis.

115
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.215
Like you say, sir, let's not
have any misunderstandings.

116
00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:30.259
I don't like it. I think it stinks.

117
00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:32.052
I've had enough insolence!

118
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.763
It's a question of practicality.

119
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:38.350
I'm the one asked to sell
this idea to 12 smiling faces.

120
00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:43.939
They do have an alternative way to go,
you know.

121
00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:48.694
-That's no way for anybody to go.
-The hell you say, major.

122
00:08:48.902 --> 00:08:51.405
I know a lot of people
who should go that way.

123
00:08:55.576 --> 00:09:00.122
That's beside the point.
Come on, what's your basic objection?

124
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.959
These men are incapable of taking
any discipline, authority...

125
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:08.630
...or intense training. If there's no
possibility for sentence remission...

126
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:12.134
...they have no reason
to cooperate, right?

127
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.474
You've got a point.
You've got a point, major.

128
00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:24.146
However, you know I don't have
the power to reverse a court-martial.

129
00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:27.316
You have the power to commute
the sentence of such a court.

130
00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:28.942
-Excuse me, general.
-Yes?

131
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:33.197
You have authority under the Visiting
Forces Act to make such a ruling.

132
00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:36.241
-Visiting Forces Act?
-Yes, sir.

133
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:41.330
All right, you've got a deal.

134
00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:45.125
Let's say if any of these men
distinguish themselves...

135
00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:49.296
...we'll give serious consideration
to commuting their sentences.

136
00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:51.256
That's no deal.

137
00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:55.052
Who's to say whether they
really distinguish themselves?

138
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.513
You can leave that decision to me.

139
00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:01.517
But remember, the other alternative
will apply with equal force.

140
00:10:01.725 --> 00:10:03.310
Any breach of security...

141
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:07.314
...any failure of discipline, those
men go back where they came from.

142
00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:09.108
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

143
00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:11.026
Good. Anything more, gentlemen?

144
00:10:11.568 --> 00:10:14.613
Yes, sir. I noticed
Colonel Breed in the waiting room.

145
00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:17.533
I wondered whether he's
connected with this operation.

146
00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:22.162
-What if he is?
-I'd be very unhappy, sir.

147
00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:25.499
Major...

148
00:10:25.707 --> 00:10:28.085
...Colonel Breed
Is your superior officer.

149
00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:30.879
And you will behave
accordingly, at all times.

150
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:33.549
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

151
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:39.555
Now, it so happens Colonel Breed
IS not concerned with this operation.

152
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:43.308
But he's running the parachute school
where your training will be.

153
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:47.229
| don't want to hear any complaints,
from either of you!

154
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:51.733
Now, you've got a job to do,
mister, so move it.

155
00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:53.360
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:55.028 --> 00:10:56.071
Thank you, gentlemen.

157
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.958
Major Reisman seems to be heading
to his own court-martial.

158
00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:12.838
He's the most ill-mannered officer
I've ever had the displeasure to meet.

159
00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:14.715
You think so, Denton?

160
00:11:14.923 --> 00:11:19.803
You may be right.
But he's sure right about one thing.

161
00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:23.265
Somebody up there must be
a raving lunatic.

162
00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:25.934
Get Colonel Breed in here.

163
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.785
All right, you men,
this is an exercise period.

164
00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:45.579
So exercise!

165
00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:04.306
Major Reisman, Sergeant Bowren, sir.

166
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:08.769
-Have the prisoners fall in.
-Sir.

167
00:12:08.977 --> 00:12:13.857
Prisoners, fall in.
All right, come on now. Get with it!

168
00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:19.655
-Come on, come on.
-Move it!

169
00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:23.242
Come on, move!
Hey, you, move, I said.

170
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:37.422
"Franko, V.R.

171
00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:40.926
Death by hanging.

172
00:12:51.853 --> 00:12:53.855
Vladek, M.

173
00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:56.191
Thirty years hard labor.

174
00:13:04.157 --> 00:13:06.660
Jefferson, R.T.

175
00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:09.454
Death by hanging.

176
00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:19.006
Pinkley, V.L.

177
00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:22.384
Thirty years imprisonment.

178
00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:33.895
Gilpin, S.

179
00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:36.440
Thirty years hard labor.

180
00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.282
Posey, S.

181
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.659
Death by hanging.

182
00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:55.417
Wladislaw, T.

183
00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.627
Death by hanging.

184
00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:02.549
Sawyer, S.K.

185
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.135
Twenty years hard labor.

186
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:12.225
Lever, R.

187
00:14:13.935 --> 00:14:15.854
Twenty years imprisonment.

188
00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:21.860
Bravos, T.R.

189
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:25.072
Twenty years hard labor.

190
00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:32.829
Jiminez, P.

191
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.917
Twenty years hard labor.

192
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.635
Maggott, A.J.

193
00:14:49.304 --> 00:14:51.056
Death by hanging."

194
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:58.397
Have them fall in according
to height, right to left.

195
00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:04.528
According to height, fall in!

196
00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:08.573
Come on, you jokers. Get in there!

197
00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:14.496
-Come on, move!
-Come on.

198
00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:18.333
Come on, here! I said, get in line.

199
00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:25.006
Straighten up your jacket there.

200
00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:29.511
Have them count off.

201
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:32.180
Sir. Count off!

202
00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:43.525
Let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

203
00:15:43.733 --> 00:15:46.862
-Hut, right!
-Right.

204
00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:58.206
Hut, hut, hut, hut.

205
00:15:58.498 --> 00:16:03.712
Two, three, four, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three.

206
00:16:12.762 --> 00:16:14.806
Squad, halt!

207
00:16:18.226 --> 00:16:20.854
About face!

208
00:16:27.652 --> 00:16:28.737
Squad, halt!

209
00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:33.533
Right face! At ease.

210
00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:37.078
What did I say to you?
Or maybe you don't understand English!

211
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.789
What's the matter, 11?

212
00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:41.708
I got a pain.

213
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.922
Where does it hurt?

214
00:16:47.088 --> 00:16:49.090
Well, I'll tell you. It's...

215
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:52.928
I wish you would.
Do it correctly, please.

216
00:16:53.136 --> 00:16:55.597
Oh, I don't have to say, sir.

217
00:16:55.805 --> 00:16:58.016
And I don't have to march, either.

218
00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:00.143
And I know the rules.

219
00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:02.103
Why don't you have to march?

220
00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:05.941
Because condemned men
don't have to drill.

221
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.821
And there's nothing you can
do about it, mister.

222
00:17:12.739 --> 00:17:13.740
What's your name, son?

223
00:17:17.702 --> 00:17:18.995
Eleven.

224
00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.083
His name is Franko, sir.

225
00:17:24.459 --> 00:17:27.504
Franko, come over here a minute.
Come on.

226
00:17:42.143 --> 00:17:46.648
Look, you little bastard, either you march,
or I'll beat your brains out.

227
00:17:46.856 --> 00:17:48.191
Understand?

228
00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:05.000
What'd you see, sergeant?

229
00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:08.795
I saw the major attacked
and forced to defend himself, sir.

230
00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:10.922
Have him taken back to his cell.

231
00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:13.675
Take his head, I'll get his feet.

232
00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:16.469
Now let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

233
00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:18.221
Yes, sir.

234
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.434
Squad, ten-hut!

235
00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:26.062
Right face.

236
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:30.734
Forward, march! Hut.

237
00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:33.778
Squad, halt.

238
00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:37.073
About face!

239
00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:40.201
Forward, march!

240
00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:54.507
General prisoner Franko, Victor, sir.

241
00:19:11.858 --> 00:19:13.276
So how's the jaw?

242
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:18.073
If you're gonna act tough,
learn how to take care of yourself.

243
00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:19.741
You really should.

244
00:19:19.949 --> 00:19:22.118
You're worried about my jaw?

245
00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.748
Franko's pain bothers the major?

246
00:19:27.415 --> 00:19:30.794
You were a big man with
the syndicate back in Chicago?

247
00:19:32.837 --> 00:19:33.838
You've seen my record.

248
00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:36.758
I've seen your record,
so let's knock it off, huh?

249
00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:39.594
What's the first thing
when you hit London?

250
00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:44.557
You get involved in a stickup
and start blasting, kill an old guy?

251
00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.601
And come away with what?

252
00:19:48.436 --> 00:19:50.188
What did you have when they got you?

253
00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:52.107
What did I have? What do you mean?

254
00:19:52.315 --> 00:19:54.859
Come on, big shot.
How much money did you have?

255
00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.778
I had enough.

256
00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:03.493
Two pounds and 10 shilling.
That's almost 10 dollars.

257
00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:07.122
You're gonna get yourself hung
for a lousy 10 bucks.

258
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.708
-What's that to you?
-Nothing.

259
00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:13.128
Then why don't you get off my back?
You didn't come to visit.

260
00:20:13.294 --> 00:20:14.546
What do you want?

261
00:20:14.754 --> 00:20:17.173
I don't care if they hang
you for 10 cents.

262
00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.843
It makes no difference to me.

263
00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:24.931
But it just so happens that
I've got a little pull around here.

264
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.435
I might be able to get you
off the hook, if I wanted to.

265
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.818
Are you a general?

266
00:20:37.026 --> 00:20:40.780
You're not a general, and only
a general can grant my reprieve.

267
00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:42.657
Look, stupid.

268
00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:46.202
I'll make you a proposition.

269
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.663
All I want from you
Is a straight yes or no.

270
00:20:50.915 --> 00:20:53.918
-You talk, I'll listen.
-Okay.

271
00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:58.548
You either can sweat out the two days
you have before the hanging...

272
00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:01.134
...or you join an outfit
I'm putting together.

273
00:21:01.342 --> 00:21:04.846
If you do that, I'll have you
out of here in less than 24 hours.

274
00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:08.475
But you'll work to death.
There's not a beating you won't take.

275
00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:14.731
And then
when I'm satisfied with you...

276
00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:18.443
...you'll go where the Army tells you.
Chances are you'll get killed anyway.

277
00:21:18.651 --> 00:21:20.236
You don't know Victor Franko.

278
00:21:21.404 --> 00:21:22.822
-Guard.
-What's the deal?

279
00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.866
What's the deal if I do stay alive?

280
00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:26.868
-Might get off the hook.
-Count me in.

281
00:21:27.076 --> 00:21:30.872
You foul up once,
anywhere along the line, just once...

282
00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:33.541
...you'll be back here
at the end of a rope.

283
00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:37.295
Hey, wait a minute.
What's the matter with you?

284
00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:39.714
You think I want to die?

285
00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:48.515
If you do,
you don't know Victor Franko.

286
00:21:49.307 --> 00:21:50.558
How come you speak German?

287
00:21:51.684 --> 00:21:53.728
Because my old man was a miner
in Silesia.

288
00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:57.232
If he didn't speak German,
he didn't dig coal and didn't eat.

289
00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.235
That was the language he spoke
when he came to the States?

290
00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:02.237
Pretty tough job in those days.

291
00:22:02.445 --> 00:22:04.364
It still is.

292
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:08.743
I don't like officers,
not any of them, and I never have.

293
00:22:11.162 --> 00:22:12.914
But you were one yourself,
weren't you?

294
00:22:14.332 --> 00:22:16.376
Yeah, three lousy days.

295
00:22:17.168 --> 00:22:19.838
Somebody must have thought
you'd make a good officer.

296
00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:21.589
They made a big mistake.

297
00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:25.593
I thought you claimed
he was going over the hill.

298
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:30.431
What are you talking about, "claimed"?
He was going over the hill.

299
00:22:31.057 --> 00:22:34.102
My outfit was pinned down by
the worst crossfire you ever saw.

300
00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:38.106
Most bleeding to death.
And this lover took off like a rabbit...

301
00:22:38.273 --> 00:22:42.443
...with the medical supplies on his back.
The only way to stop him was to shoot him.

302
00:22:44.153 --> 00:22:45.989
Anyhow, he had it coming.

303
00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:50.451
Yeah. But you only made
one mistake, eh?

304
00:22:52.787 --> 00:22:54.122
Guard.

305
00:22:56.624 --> 00:22:59.043
You let somebody see you do it.

306
00:23:08.511 --> 00:23:11.431
General prisoner Maggott, A.J., sir.

307
00:23:15.643 --> 00:23:18.479
"Maggott, A.J. Death by hanging."

308
00:23:18.646 --> 00:23:19.647
Hey, Midnight.

309
00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:23.610
Be a good boy, and maybe I'll
let you eat with the white folks.

310
00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:38.833
Well, Maggott, I see you've got
a sense of humor.

311
00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:44.881
The all-American hero,
laughing in the face of death.

312
00:23:50.845 --> 00:23:53.556
They're not gonna hang me, major.

313
00:23:55.516 --> 00:23:58.353
I never raped that evil slut...

314
00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:02.565
...or any other creature.

315
00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:05.360
The Lord gave me that woman
to chastise her.

316
00:24:05.526 --> 00:24:07.695
Then he told you to beat her
to death, huh?

317
00:24:07.862 --> 00:24:10.323
I only do what I'm called on to do.

318
00:24:12.283 --> 00:24:17.080
I was in a state of grace.
And that woman...

319
00:24:17.288 --> 00:24:19.040
...she tried to soil my spirit.

320
00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:21.209
Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.

321
00:24:21.376 --> 00:24:24.796
But it seems to me I remember
a quotation that goes like:

322
00:24:25.004 --> 00:24:26.214
"Vengeance is mine."

323
00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:32.845
"Vengeance is mine.
I will repay, sayeth the Lord."

324
00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:35.848
Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.

325
00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:39.185
Exactly. Isn't that
supposed to mean...

326
00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:42.355
...we |leave punishment of
the transgressors to his hands?

327
00:24:42.563 --> 00:24:46.693
That's right, major.
That's exactly what it means.

328
00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:51.197
But it doesn't restrict him to the
kind of tools he would use, does it?

329
00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:55.493
And like I told you, major,
I only do what I'm called on to do.

330
00:24:56.202 --> 00:24:59.330
You know, I don't think you're
going to hang after all.

331
00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:06.421
I think a man like you is destined
for higher things. Guard!

332
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:16.264
Besides, us Southern boys have
to stick together now, don't we?

333
00:25:22.895 --> 00:25:25.189
I sure didn't mean
to kill that fellow.

334
00:25:25.398 --> 00:25:28.609
But you do like I say,
and maybe they won't hang you.

335
00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:31.863
Fixing to kill me some other way?

336
00:25:32.071 --> 00:25:33.614
It might not come to that.

337
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.327
I reckon the folks would be happier
if I died like a soldier.

338
00:25:41.622 --> 00:25:43.332
Can't say I would.

339
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.335
Who does this hotshot major
think he is?

340
00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.671
Making us play wet nurses
to a bunch of scum.

341
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.548
Corporal Morgan.

342
00:25:50.757 --> 00:25:54.802
If you can't find something to do,
I'll find something for you.

343
00:25:56.179 --> 00:25:57.972
Now, move it.

344
00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:03.811
Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.
You know why I'm here.

345
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.733
Or maybe you think I should've let
those cracker bastards castrate me?

346
00:26:09.525 --> 00:26:12.111
Seeing what those guys
tried to do to you...

347
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.823
...I'd say you had
considerable justification.

348
00:26:16.949 --> 00:26:21.996
Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.
I really do thank you for that.

349
00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:27.794
But the court didn't agree, right?
So where does that leave you?

350
00:26:28.002 --> 00:26:31.255
I'm offering an alternative,
meaning you can keep fighting.

351
00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:34.175
-Who for, major?
-For yourself, if you want.

352
00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:37.512
But the Krauts,
they're the real master-race merchants.

353
00:26:37.678 --> 00:26:42.850
That's your war, not mine.
You don't like the Krauts, you fight them.

354
00:26:43.893 --> 00:26:46.187
Me, I'll pick my own enemies.

355
00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:52.151
That's your privilege. But you won't
be able to exercise it much longer.

356
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.489
Because on March 25th,
you have a date with the hangman.

357
00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:02.578
That's just six days from now.

358
00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:12.213
Buenos dias, major.

359
00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:17.969
Sergeant, going over
the transcript of that man's trial...

360
00:27:18.177 --> 00:27:20.304
...there are a couple of things
I don't get.

361
00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:24.058
Did he ever claim
that he didn't do it?

362
00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:28.062
I beg your pardon, but you haven't
been around prisons much, have you?

363
00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:32.400
You see, the first thing one learns
in prison, everybody is innocent.

364
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.362
This one doesn't say too much
about that one way or another.

365
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:41.450
He's only disturbed because we don't
allow him strings for his guitar.

366
00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:46.205
Did you ever lose a man because
he hung himself with a guitar string?

367
00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:48.708
No, sir, I haven't,
and I'm not about to.

368
00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:51.460
If he makes the trip,
see he gets the strings.

369
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:53.004
Yes, sir.

370
00:27:58.926 --> 00:28:00.469
Attention!

371
00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:11.189
-Tell the men to be seated.
-Yes, sir. Take seats!

372
00:28:12.815 --> 00:28:14.192
-Guards out.
-Sir, |-

373
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.611
-Guards out.
-Yes, sir.

374
00:28:16.944 --> 00:28:19.447
You heard him. Guards, out!

375
00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:34.629
My name, for those of you who may have
forgotten, is Reisman.

376
00:28:35.504 --> 00:28:39.842
You've volunteered for a mission that
gives you just three ways to go:

377
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:44.347
Foul up in training and be sent
back here for execution of sentence...

378
00:28:44.555 --> 00:28:45.765
...or foul up in combat...

379
00:28:45.973 --> 00:28:48.476
...in which case
I'll blow your brains out...

380
00:28:48.684 --> 00:28:52.605
...or you can do as you're told,
in which case you might just get by.

381
00:28:52.813 --> 00:28:54.649
You must not attempt to escape.

382
00:28:54.857 --> 00:28:57.193
There will be no excuses, no appeal.

383
00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.445
Any breach of these conditions...

384
00:28:59.654 --> 00:29:01.989
...by any of you means
you'll all be shipped...

385
00:29:02.156 --> 00:29:04.325
...back for immediate
execution of sentence.

386
00:29:05.826 --> 00:29:07.995
You are dependent upon each other.

387
00:29:08.162 --> 00:29:10.831
Any one of you try anything smart...

388
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.876
...and the 12 of you get it
right in the head.

389
00:29:17.129 --> 00:29:19.173
So try to remember that.

390
00:29:20.424 --> 00:29:21.634
Any questions?

391
00:29:26.514 --> 00:29:27.848
Sir?

392
00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.312
Do we have to eat with niggers?

393
00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:41.821
It's all right.
The gentleman from the South...

394
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:45.366
...made inquiries about
the dining arrangements.

395
00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:48.869
They're discussing the place
card settings. All right?

396
00:29:49.036 --> 00:29:51.747
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

397
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.629
Corporal, fellas, let's get with it.
Remember?

398
00:29:58.838 --> 00:30:01.590
Baseball, pitching?
Chicago's always had a pitcher.

399
00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.884
But now, as far as hitting goes...

400
00:30:04.093 --> 00:30:07.471
...my sister can hit
better than half them fellas.

401
00:30:08.764 --> 00:30:10.391
Let's move it out!

402
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.565
Well, what do you think, sergeant?

403
00:30:17.773 --> 00:30:19.567
I think you'll do just fine, sir.

404
00:30:19.734 --> 00:30:22.194
Don't give me that.
I said, what do you think?

405
00:30:25.406 --> 00:30:28.200
I think the first chance
one of them lovers gets...

406
00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:31.746
...he's gonna shoot the major
right in the head, sir.

407
00:30:33.414 --> 00:30:35.541
-Thank you, sergeant.
-Sir.

408
00:30:37.251 --> 00:30:39.587
Okay, Franko. Let's go.

409
00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:44.717
All right, move it out.

410
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.463
Come on.

411
00:31:44.985 --> 00:31:45.986
Over there.

412
00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:56.747
Sergeant, have the men fall in.
Facing me.

413
00:31:56.914 --> 00:32:01.001
Sir. All right, on your feet.
Fall in over here, double quick now!

414
00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:04.672
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up!

415
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.845
Jiminez, get in there!

416
00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:14.306
Ten-hut!

417
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:18.602
All right, Franko,
get rid of that cigarette.

418
00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:21.856
Thank you.

419
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.943
This will be your home
until further notice.

420
00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:28.904
What there is of it
will be built by you...

421
00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:32.032
...but it will not interfere
with your training.

422
00:32:32.199 --> 00:32:36.078
The sooner you get it up, the sooner
you'll sleep in out of the rain.

423
00:32:37.163 --> 00:32:38.873
-Sergeant.
-Sir?

424
00:32:39.331 --> 00:32:43.711
You're in charge. I want this
compound up within the month.

425
00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.463
Thank you.

426
00:34:08.837 --> 00:34:11.632
If this place was on fire,
it'd burn to the ground.

427
00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:13.634
Come on, what are you doing?

428
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:15.803
All right, come on. Let's move.

429
00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:24.103
Hey, Maggott, what are you? German?

430
00:34:36.782 --> 00:34:39.159
What are you trying to do,
break the window?

431
00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:41.495
All right, sergeant, fall them in.

432
00:34:42.454 --> 00:34:44.873
Fall in, in front of the hut.
On the double!

433
00:34:51.046 --> 00:34:52.339
At ease.

434
00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:57.928
All right, that'll be all for today.

435
00:34:58.304 --> 00:35:00.723
How come they got
all the comforts of home?

436
00:35:01.181 --> 00:35:04.893
Why can't we put our floor in?
Why can't we put our windows in?

437
00:35:05.144 --> 00:35:08.272
-Franko's right.
-I'd rather sleep in my cell.

438
00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:12.109
Mr. Franko, with his keen eye
for detail...

439
00:35:12.318 --> 00:35:15.529
...has noted that the prisoners'
quarters are not ready.

440
00:35:16.905 --> 00:35:19.158
The answer to that is simple:

441
00:35:19.366 --> 00:35:22.077
You are not yet ready
to occupy that hut...

442
00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:25.414
...with the degree of comfort
that you would like.

443
00:35:26.332 --> 00:35:29.710
When I think that you've earned
that privilege, I'll let you know.

444
00:35:31.545 --> 00:35:33.839
Reveille is at 0530.

445
00:35:34.048 --> 00:35:35.382
That is all. Sergeant.

446
00:35:36.592 --> 00:35:38.385
You heard the man, chow time!

447
00:35:38.552 --> 00:35:40.054
Dismissed!

448
00:35:42.514 --> 00:35:45.476
That's it, fellas. Speak up, boys.
Speak up.

449
00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:53.776
Wind it up, strike one!

450
00:35:54.777 --> 00:35:58.322
Joseph, is that the way they did it
in the Polish navy?

451
00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.532
You won't win any cigars that way.

452
00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.332
Hey, Franko, number, please.

453
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.417
Ask the operator for my nickel back.

454
00:36:10.584 --> 00:36:13.712
Why don't you guys
just dry up and blow away?

455
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.225
Meanwhile, on the Atlantic wall...

456
00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:29.395
...the German forces
have been preparing...

457
00:36:29.603 --> 00:36:32.272
...a few nice surprises for you,
gentlemen...

458
00:36:32.439 --> 00:36:35.025
...just in case Mr. Churchill...

459
00:36:35.234 --> 00:36:38.612
...is foolish enough
to attempt an invasion.

460
00:36:39.279 --> 00:36:42.366
He may not be
unduly worried about this...

461
00:36:42.574 --> 00:36:46.745
...but then, of course,
he will not be taking part...

462
00:36:46.912 --> 00:36:48.122
...In such an--

463
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.624
What's this guy's name?

464
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:53.168
You ought to know.
You listen to him every night.

465
00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:57.548
-Dumbo, get me a cup of coffee.
-You crazy?

466
00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:02.845
I say shut the guy up.

467
00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:06.724
-Sleepy time.
-Jump through this.

468
00:37:19.278 --> 00:37:21.196
Hey, you. Come here.

469
00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:24.742
You look like an intelligent guy.

470
00:37:26.034 --> 00:37:28.412
-You like it here?
-No.

471
00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:30.622
You gonna stay here?

472
00:37:31.457 --> 00:37:35.169
-Well, I ain't got nowhere else to go.
-Ah, you're an idiot.

473
00:37:40.924 --> 00:37:43.510
Hey, Wladislaw.
You understand German.

474
00:37:43.844 --> 00:37:45.387
Who's that dame singing about?

475
00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:49.683
Well, it's about a very lonely girl...

476
00:37:50.184 --> 00:37:53.228
...who's sick and tired of war
and being left alone.

477
00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:55.355
Waiting for her man.

478
00:37:55.856 --> 00:37:59.026
Keep that cheap, wailing slut quiet!

479
00:38:07.493 --> 00:38:10.078
Let's cut out the community sing.

480
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.373
Get some sleep. You're gonna need it.

481
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.209
Up yours.

482
00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:18.629
Creeps. They're all creeps.
That's what they are.

483
00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:34.561
Hey, where you going?

484
00:38:34.853 --> 00:38:35.854
Going to the can.

485
00:38:36.021 --> 00:38:37.981
-You want me to come?
-You kidding?

486
00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:08.095
They're after Franko.

487
00:39:24.444 --> 00:39:26.154
You trying to get us all hung?

488
00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:29.867
We're all dead anyway. How come
you believe that creep Reisman?

489
00:39:30.075 --> 00:39:33.954
Want that bum to make suckers out
of you? Whose side are you on?

490
00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:41.962
What's with you?

491
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.883
What is this, anyway?
Uncle Tom week?

492
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:48.302
You come with me, we're home free.

493
00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:53.974
He doesn't care about you.

494
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.151
If we go on that mission,
we all get killed. That's what they want!

495
00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:08.447
Those idiots in there are gonna get shot.
Every last one of them.

496
00:40:08.655 --> 00:40:12.659
You, you slob, you slob.
What do you think you've got coming?

497
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.276
-Slipped on a bar of soap, huh?
-Yeah.

498
00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:51.281
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

499
00:40:51.823 --> 00:40:55.160
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

500
00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:57.037
Come on, Jiminez. Move it.

501
00:40:57.245 --> 00:41:01.667
When the time comes, you've got
34 seconds to clear that distance.

502
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:04.211
I can't make it, major.

503
00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:07.464
Oh, come on, Jiminez.
Move it. Don't stop now.

504
00:41:07.673 --> 00:41:09.049
I can't! I can't!

505
00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:12.052
-Come on, Jiminez. Move.
-I really can't.

506
00:41:12.594 --> 00:41:13.929
Can't make it, major.

507
00:41:14.137 --> 00:41:15.305
I can't make it!

508
00:41:15.514 --> 00:41:20.143
You come down that rope,
you're going straight back to prison.

509
00:41:20.352 --> 00:41:21.561
I can't. I can't!

510
00:41:22.187 --> 00:41:23.855
Really, I can't.

511
00:41:24.314 --> 00:41:27.192
Sergeant, give me that weapon.
Take a spin on that rope.

512
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.904
I can't make it. I can't make it!

513
00:41:31.321 --> 00:41:32.739
I can't!

514
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.158
I really can't make it.

515
00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:36.827
I can't!

516
00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:44.918
Boy, look at him go now!

517
00:41:51.091 --> 00:41:52.968
So you couldn't make it, huh?

518
00:41:53.885 --> 00:41:56.304
Posey, let's see that Apache know-how.

519
00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:59.641
Re-thread that pulley
and get another rope down here.

520
00:42:00.642 --> 00:42:03.020
Give these others
a crack at immortality.

521
00:42:03.228 --> 00:42:07.315
You said Mayonnaise was the only
one supposed to get on top of that.

522
00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:12.612
But suppose Jiminez gets killed before
he gets to the top of that chateau?

523
00:42:12.904 --> 00:42:16.450
-Come on, Posey. Move it.
-Come on, get that thing up here.

524
00:42:16.658 --> 00:42:18.952
We'll have it ready in a minute.

525
00:42:21.288 --> 00:42:23.373
All right, Franko, you're next.

526
00:42:33.633 --> 00:42:35.469
So much for hygiene on the field.

527
00:42:36.636 --> 00:42:39.139
Which one of you wants
to stick this in the major?

528
00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:45.353
Well, major, if it's gonna
help the war effort...

529
00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:47.147
You'll get your chance.

530
00:42:48.982 --> 00:42:50.358
Well, let's see...

531
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:52.819
-Posey.
-Me?

532
00:42:52.986 --> 00:42:54.321
Yeah, step out here.

533
00:42:54.529 --> 00:42:55.822
I'd rather not, sir.

534
00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:59.034
Look, Posey, it's just an example.
Come on, now.

535
00:42:59.659 --> 00:43:01.036
Will you hold this knife?

536
00:43:02.537 --> 00:43:05.165
It's got a scabbard.
It can't hurt anybody.

537
00:43:10.629 --> 00:43:13.215
Tell me, Posey,
what'd they lock you up for?

538
00:43:13.423 --> 00:43:15.217
I mean, what did you do?

539
00:43:16.176 --> 00:43:17.511
I already told you, sir.

540
00:43:17.677 --> 00:43:22.682
Tell me again. I'm sure your friends
over here would like to know too.

541
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:25.435
-What'd you do, Posey?
-Yeah, fill him in.

542
00:43:27.562 --> 00:43:30.941
This fella kept pushing me.
I don't like to be pushed. I hit him.

543
00:43:31.316 --> 00:43:34.277
Killed a man with bare hands
because he shoved you?

544
00:43:35.737 --> 00:43:37.489
I only hit him once.

545
00:43:38.198 --> 00:43:40.200
Only hit him once.

546
00:43:40.408 --> 00:43:44.704
Drove his jawbone right through his
brain because he pushed him.

547
00:43:45.038 --> 00:43:48.750
- I didn't mean to kill him.
-You didn't mean to, but you did.

548
00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:52.212
What would you do if you meant
to kill somebody?

549
00:43:54.256 --> 00:43:57.884
If you had to kill somebody with a knife,
do you think you could?

550
00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.928
-Tell me.
-I'd rather not.

551
00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:02.139
I don't care what you'd rather do.

552
00:44:02.347 --> 00:44:05.308
Stick that knife in me.
You can do that. Come on.

553
00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:10.564
-Major, I don't want to do this.
-Just stick it near me, it won't hurt.

554
00:44:10.772 --> 00:44:11.898
Come on.

555
00:44:12.065 --> 00:44:15.026
-I don't want to hurt you.
-You're not. I'm gonna hurt you.

556
00:44:15.235 --> 00:44:17.362
-Stick me.
- I don't want no trouble.

557
00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:20.365
I'll give you all the trouble
you'll ever get.

558
00:44:20.574 --> 00:44:23.743
Come on, now.
Just stick that knife right there.

559
00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:25.245
You're a big boy.

560
00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:27.831
You'd kill a man if he shoved you?

561
00:44:28.039 --> 00:44:30.333
-Come on. Let me have it.
-Stick him!

562
00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:34.337
Give it to me or I'm gonna
shove you right through the wall!

563
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.673
Come on. Give it to him!

564
00:44:36.882 --> 00:44:38.967
-Stab him!
-Get him!

565
00:44:42.512 --> 00:44:45.432
I want that knife.
Why won't you give it to me?

566
00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:47.601
You're being shoved!

567
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.647
-Stick him!
-Knock him down, Posey!

568
00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:54.816
What a name for a guy like you.

569
00:44:55.066 --> 00:44:57.444
-Stop!
-Don't you tell me what to do.

570
00:44:57.611 --> 00:44:58.695
I don't like pushing.

571
00:44:58.862 --> 00:45:00.947
Give it to him good!

572
00:45:01.114 --> 00:45:02.616
I don't like to be shoved.

573
00:45:04.993 --> 00:45:07.120
Stop pushing!

574
00:45:21.635 --> 00:45:24.346
-Yes, sir?
-Are you all right?

575
00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:27.224
Yeah.

576
00:45:27.974 --> 00:45:29.559
All right, now. Relax.

577
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.479
Come on, get up.

578
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.986
You learn how to take care
of that temper of yours...

579
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:42.447
...nobody'll take this knife away.

580
00:45:42.656 --> 00:45:43.949
You're right. I'm sorry.

581
00:45:44.157 --> 00:45:46.201
Okay, major. We're all set.

582
00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:49.621
You go on in and see Captain Kinder.

583
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:52.791
-What's he gonna do?
-He's just gonna talk to you.

584
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.503
-Brush yourself off and go on in.
-Yes, sir.

585
00:45:59.005 --> 00:46:01.591
All right, which
of you gentlemen is next?

586
00:46:01.883 --> 00:46:04.135
Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.

587
00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:08.348
All right, Maggott. You're next.

588
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.644
Speed it up, men.
Come on, speed it up.

589
00:46:17.899 --> 00:46:19.025
They're looking good.

590
00:46:19.192 --> 00:46:23.280
Yes, sir. I hope they don't forget
what they're getting in shape for.

591
00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.910
Kinder figures he can
teach me letters.

592
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.080
My folks'd be proud if I wrote.

593
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.750
That would put you way ahead
of most of the guys here.

594
00:46:36.835 --> 00:46:39.004
Better fall in and join them.

595
00:46:39.379 --> 00:46:41.881
It's true that I've been blessed...

596
00:46:42.048 --> 00:46:45.385
...with an insight into women
that others don't have.

597
00:46:45.552 --> 00:46:49.806
And sometimes...
Sometimes I'm called upon...

598
00:46:50.015 --> 00:46:52.100
...to use it in our
Beloved Master's will.

599
00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:56.313
If women are your special province,
why do you hate Reisman?

600
00:46:59.065 --> 00:47:02.485
There are 11 evil men out there...

601
00:47:05.238 --> 00:47:08.241
...and they must be punished
for their wickedness.

602
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:11.661
Reisman snatched them up
from the brink of the pit...

603
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:14.414
...and he cheated the Master
of his vengeance.

604
00:47:14.622 --> 00:47:17.334
You think that's what God wants?
To punish these men?

605
00:47:18.084 --> 00:47:20.920
Oh, he will, captain. He will.

606
00:47:21.254 --> 00:47:22.297
Major Reisman too.

607
00:47:22.464 --> 00:47:23.590
What does that give you?

608
00:47:24.132 --> 00:47:25.717
It doesn't give me anything.

609
00:47:25.925 --> 00:47:28.553
Along with these other results,
it gives you...

610
00:47:28.762 --> 00:47:32.766
...about the most twisted bunch
of psychopathic deformities ever!

611
00:47:33.224 --> 00:47:36.686
And the worst, the most dangerous
of the bunch is Maggott.

612
00:47:37.228 --> 00:47:38.688
One religious maniac...

613
00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:41.524
...one malignant dwarf,
two near-idiots...

614
00:47:41.983 --> 00:47:44.027
The rest, I don't want to think about.

615
00:47:44.235 --> 00:47:46.529
I can't think of a better way
to fight.

616
00:47:46.738 --> 00:47:51.117
The results of these tests
point to the fact that each man...

617
00:47:51.284 --> 00:47:55.372
...has a built-in resentment against
any kind of authority. Any kind.

618
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:57.248
Don't you?

619
00:47:57.415 --> 00:48:01.419
These guys think the U.S. Army
is their enemy, not the Germans.

620
00:48:01.628 --> 00:48:03.296
They know the U.S. Army.

621
00:48:03.922 --> 00:48:06.257
The Krauts haven't done
anything to them yet.

622
00:48:06.466 --> 00:48:07.926
Very sophisticated.

623
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.806
At least they know the U.S. Army.

624
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:16.476
You can twist it any way you want.
But the point is...

625
00:48:16.726 --> 00:48:21.064
...you are their main enemy.
When the time comes, you'll be a target.

626
00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:23.858
At least it gives them
something in common.

627
00:48:24.025 --> 00:48:25.068
What do you mean?

628
00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:28.696
They've come a long way individually,
further than we thought.

629
00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:31.116
Not as a unit. Not as a group.

630
00:48:31.324 --> 00:48:34.327
They've gotta function as a team.
That's what's lacking.

631
00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:36.663
Putting them on guard duty will help?

632
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.290
It might give them
a sense of participation.

633
00:48:41.167 --> 00:48:44.504
Why don't you let me weed out
the morons? Especially Maggot.

634
00:48:44.712 --> 00:48:48.842
I didn't pick these men, the Army did.
I didn't pick the assignment.

635
00:48:49.008 --> 00:48:52.512
This is one time the Army's going
with a starting lineup.

636
00:48:52.762 --> 00:48:55.890
-Including Maggott?
-Including Maggott. Cheers.

637
00:48:59.352 --> 00:49:00.854
We could get ourselves hurt.

638
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.897
Why don't you shut up, huh?

639
00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.525
You planning to save your mother?

640
00:49:05.733 --> 00:49:06.943
Why don't you lay off?

641
00:49:07.152 --> 00:49:09.070
Want me to show you how to do it?

642
00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:11.239
All right.

643
00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:16.619
Take my arm, put it around your neck.
Very simple, right?

644
00:49:16.828 --> 00:49:19.122
And then it's all in the leverage.

645
00:49:20.623 --> 00:49:23.209
Better learn how to fall.
You'll end up in a wheelchair.

646
00:49:23.376 --> 00:49:28.006
That's what I was trying to tell him.
You just don't know how to fall right.

647
00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:30.758
Slob. Ah, that's a bad attitude.

648
00:49:30.925 --> 00:49:33.720
Kind of rough on the little fella.
Like to try that with me?

649
00:49:44.105 --> 00:49:45.732
This is really quite simple.

650
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.485
I'll say a word,
and you come back at me...

651
00:49:48.693 --> 00:49:50.820
...with whatever comes to your mind.

652
00:49:51.362 --> 00:49:55.158
For instance, if I say "happiness,"
you might say "children."

653
00:49:55.366 --> 00:49:57.076
I wouldn't say that.

654
00:49:58.536 --> 00:50:02.373
That was just an example.
If I said "ambition," what would you say?

655
00:50:03.875 --> 00:50:05.502
I wouldn't say anything.

656
00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:09.589
Well, let's give it a try, okay?

657
00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:14.260
-Weapon.
-Baseball.

658
00:50:14.427 --> 00:50:16.971
-Knife.
-Dodgers.

659
00:50:17.805 --> 00:50:19.807
-Officer.
-Pitcher.

660
00:50:21.476 --> 00:50:25.563
You seem to be thinking about
just one thing, aren't you?

661
00:50:25.772 --> 00:50:28.358
Yeah. What are you thinking about?

662
00:50:30.235 --> 00:50:33.321
Well, I don't want you
to think of just one thing.

663
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.283
I'd like for you to concentrate
on each word I throw at you.

664
00:50:38.785 --> 00:50:40.119
Okay.

665
00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:42.747
Food.

666
00:50:43.164 --> 00:50:44.624
Cincinnati.

667
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:49.170
-Comfort.
-Chicago.

668
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:50.755
What made you say that?

669
00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:53.466
That's what I was thinking about.

670
00:51:04.686 --> 00:51:05.770
The hell with it!

671
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.690
Franko, what is it this time?

672
00:51:08.898 --> 00:51:11.067
How can I shave in cold water?!

673
00:51:11.276 --> 00:51:14.320
You're in the field.
Where are you gonna get hot water?

674
00:51:14.529 --> 00:51:16.614
You and the guards got hot water!

675
00:51:16.864 --> 00:51:18.533
-You're in the field!
-Tough.

676
00:51:18.741 --> 00:51:21.286
How come you guys have hot water
and we don't?

677
00:51:21.494 --> 00:51:23.871
Quiet! You keep your big mouth shut.

678
00:51:24.289 --> 00:51:27.041
-We ain't shaving in cold water!
-Not if you don't.

679
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:30.211
You want us to shave in cold water?
Why don't you?

680
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.713
-That's right.
-Yeah!

681
00:51:31.921 --> 00:51:33.840
Franko means it!

682
00:51:34.048 --> 00:51:36.634
We ain't shaving or washing
in cold water!

683
00:51:36.843 --> 00:51:38.136
-Is that right?
-Right!

684
00:51:38.344 --> 00:51:40.513
The guards got hot, we won't use cold.

685
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.806
You can't make us!

686
00:51:42.015 --> 00:51:44.851
You're gonna get yourself
into hot water, Franko.

687
00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:47.186
So what? You gonna hang us?

688
00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:49.564
What? They can't do nothing!

689
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.567
Now what are you gonna do!?

690
00:51:55.528 --> 00:51:58.823
You know, I think Franko
might be right this time.

691
00:51:59.032 --> 00:52:01.868
Shaving in cold water won't make us
any better soldiers.

692
00:52:02.994 --> 00:52:05.371
Sir, we got some trouble outside.

693
00:52:05.872 --> 00:52:08.249
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear.

694
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:17.800
All right, sergeant. Fall them in.

695
00:52:18.009 --> 00:52:20.219
All right, fall in. On your feet!

696
00:52:20.887 --> 00:52:22.722
Fall in right over here, Posey!

697
00:52:24.182 --> 00:52:26.225
Dress it up there. Get in line!

698
00:52:27.226 --> 00:52:30.438
What's this about shaving?
Who is refusing to shave?

699
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.190
-We are!
-Who is we?

700
00:52:32.357 --> 00:52:33.399
We!

701
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.612
All those refusing to shave,
take one step forward.

702
00:53:00.426 --> 00:53:02.762
So you want to stink, huh?

703
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.473
And maybe itch too?

704
00:53:05.765 --> 00:53:08.810
That's okay with me
because I don't have to smell you.

705
00:53:09.227 --> 00:53:13.481
There will be no further issue of
shaving equipment or the use of soap.

706
00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.942
And there will be no more hot meals.

707
00:53:16.401 --> 00:53:17.443
Just K rations.

708
00:53:18.486 --> 00:53:20.822
Courtesy of Mr. Franko.

709
00:53:27.995 --> 00:53:29.205
At ease.

710
00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:33.084
I think we got something.

711
00:53:33.292 --> 00:53:35.712
Yeah, it's what
the Navy calls "mutiny."

712
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.590
Remember what I was saying
about 12 rugged individualists?

713
00:53:40.967 --> 00:53:44.679
You heard them. It was all
"we ain't gonna do this and that."

714
00:53:44.887 --> 00:53:47.306
When I said to step forward,
even Posey joined.

715
00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:50.643
I bet he's been shaving in cold water
since he was a kid.

716
00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.979
Boy, do I love that Franko.

717
00:53:53.146 --> 00:53:58.359
That means that we are going to have
that much more time for work.

718
00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:04.323
So now, if you...

719
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:08.244
..."dirty dozen" have no objections...

720
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:11.956
...we will get our equipment...

721
00:54:12.498 --> 00:54:16.294
...and we will start in. Right now.

722
00:54:29.724 --> 00:54:31.726
That's very good.

723
00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:35.188
You look just like real soldiers.

724
00:54:36.022 --> 00:54:37.565
Fall out!

725
00:54:38.524 --> 00:54:39.817
Now, move it!

726
00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:45.323
You're still the dirtiest soldiers
in this man's army...

727
00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:48.284
...and you're getting
filthier every day.

728
00:54:48.868 --> 00:54:51.037
But your training is almost over.

729
00:54:52.538 --> 00:54:56.876
Two days from now, you'll be learning
how to jump with a parachute.

730
00:54:57.752 --> 00:55:00.588
This training will take place
at a regular Army base.

731
00:55:00.963 --> 00:55:05.551
And I just want to remind you
that this operation is secret.

732
00:55:05.718 --> 00:55:07.428
Top secret.

733
00:55:08.262 --> 00:55:12.058
You will not be wearing dog tags.
You will not say anything to anyone.

734
00:55:12.225 --> 00:55:14.477
Do you understand? Nothing. Nothing!

735
00:55:15.269 --> 00:55:18.231
One word, one slip
from any one of you...

736
00:55:18.523 --> 00:55:20.733
...and the deal is off!

737
00:55:21.108 --> 00:55:23.069
You all know what that means, right?

738
00:55:26.989 --> 00:55:28.574
All right, serve it up.

739
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:30.451
All right, serve it up!

740
00:55:32.453 --> 00:55:35.456
Colonel Breed won't like this secrecy.
He'll want to know.

741
00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:38.835
-We're still top priority, aren't we?
-You can't ignore--

742
00:55:39.043 --> 00:55:41.212
-Do we have the juice?
-Yes, but--

743
00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.131
Then I don't care
what Colonel Breed likes.

744
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:47.510
Look, you're supposed to be
the liaison officer.

745
00:55:47.718 --> 00:55:52.765
I want orders to the highest echelon,
stating to Colonel Breed...

746
00:55:52.974 --> 00:55:57.061
...that a group, over which he will
have no authority, will be arriving...

747
00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:01.274
...and the identity of the men is secret.
Tell him we got a general...

748
00:56:01.482 --> 00:56:06.279
...or any damn thing, but just get
that West Point bum off of my back.

749
00:56:07.113 --> 00:56:08.614
A general, huh?

750
00:56:09.657 --> 00:56:11.117
I'll see what I can do.

751
00:56:11.784 --> 00:56:12.785
I know you will.

752
00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:14.662
What kind of food is that?

753
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:16.747
Okay, pig face, serve it up!

754
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:18.541
What is it?

755
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:21.961
I don't know.
I never ate anything like this.

756
00:56:22.169 --> 00:56:24.964
I've stepped in it a couple of times,
but I never ate it.

757
00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:26.215
What is it?

758
00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:31.929
Did you ask what general?

759
00:56:32.138 --> 00:56:33.806
Got the same thing again:

760
00:56:33.973 --> 00:56:36.601
No information beyond
what was in the order.

761
00:56:38.352 --> 00:56:39.478
General Denton?

762
00:56:39.645 --> 00:56:43.441
When we first called, his extension
was busy. Now he's not there.

763
00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.165
Not now.

764
00:57:08.341 --> 00:57:10.676
-Well, what about you?
-Nothing, sir.

765
00:57:25.107 --> 00:57:26.692
Not now, you--!

766
00:57:45.252 --> 00:57:46.712
I think they're coming.

767
00:57:46.879 --> 00:57:47.964
Yeah, it's them.

768
00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:54.261
Yes? Sir, they just passed
the checkpoint!

769
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.888
Let's go.

770
00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:01.310
Now. Now!

771
00:58:14.073 --> 00:58:16.367
Sounds like we're running
into a party.

772
00:58:17.326 --> 00:58:19.787
Boy, you don't suppose
it's for us, do you?

773
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:48.566
Present arms!

774
00:58:52.903 --> 00:58:54.613
Major Reisman reporting, sir.

775
00:58:57.366 --> 00:58:58.492
Where's the general?

776
00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:07.043
He's in the truck.
You understand he's traveling incognito.

777
00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:12.798
We thought he might inspect
our number one platoon.

778
00:59:13.132 --> 00:59:16.927
If you give me a moment,
I'll see if he's willing to do that.

779
00:59:17.928 --> 00:59:20.347
Order, halt!

780
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.101
How come the band?

781
00:59:24.602 --> 00:59:27.438
-What the hell are we waiting for?
-Expecting a guest list.

782
00:59:27.646 --> 00:59:30.191
-What guest list?
-What's the matter with you?

783
00:59:33.194 --> 00:59:35.988
Which one of you guys
wants to be a general?

784
00:59:36.989 --> 00:59:38.157
Pinkley.

785
00:59:40.117 --> 00:59:42.161
What? What kind of a general, sir?

786
00:59:42.661 --> 00:59:46.415
Just a plain ordinary, everyday,
home-loving American general.

787
00:59:46.624 --> 00:59:48.334
I'd rather be a civilian, sir.

788
00:59:52.546 --> 00:59:53.714
What do I have to do?

789
00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:57.718
You've seen generals inspecting troops.
Just walk slow and act stupid.

790
00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:01.013
Up one rank, down the other,
and back to the truck.

791
01:00:01.388 --> 01:00:04.809
They're expecting a general.
That's exactly what they'll get.

792
01:00:05.017 --> 01:00:06.393
Let's go.

793
01:00:09.271 --> 01:00:12.149
-Move it. Come on, move it!
-Ten-hut!

794
01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:14.443
Present arms!

795
01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:15.903
Let's go, move it.

796
01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.246
Fall in!

797
01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:31.252
-Pinkley's gonna be a general.
-Why?

798
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.045
-What?
-Shut up and watch.

799
01:00:46.183 --> 01:00:48.853
1st Platoon
waiting for inspection, sir!

800
01:01:18.924 --> 01:01:22.761
They're very pretty, colonel.
Very pretty.

801
01:01:22.928 --> 01:01:25.097
-But can they fight?
-Yes, sir.

802
01:01:25.264 --> 01:01:26.807
I hope you're right.

803
01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:35.191
-Where are you from, son?
-Madison City, Missouri, sir.

804
01:01:37.943 --> 01:01:39.028
Never heard of it.

805
01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:46.660
All right, major, we've got
work to do. Thank you, colonel.

806
01:01:59.423 --> 01:02:00.966
Hold it down. Hold it down.

807
01:02:05.971 --> 01:02:09.308
You pull a stunt like that again,
I'll beat your brains out!

808
01:02:12.519 --> 01:02:15.606
Sergeant, fall them into
a column of twos then move out.

809
01:02:15.814 --> 01:02:20.361
Yes, sir. Fall out. Fall into column
of twos on me. Fall out!

810
01:02:40.881 --> 01:02:41.882
Reisman!

811
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:49.390
Some people may consider you
a first-class officer.

812
01:02:49.848 --> 01:02:54.603
But as far as I'm concerned,
you're a disorganized, undisciplined clown.

813
01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:57.856
I'll make it my business
to run you out of this Army.

814
01:02:58.023 --> 01:03:00.067
I owe you an apology.

815
01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:04.530
I always thought that you were a cold,
unimaginative, tight-lipped officer.

816
01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:09.702
But you're really quite emotional,
aren't you?

817
01:03:15.874 --> 01:03:17.835
Clayton. Blake.

818
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.261
-Hey, watch it.
-Watch out, will you?

819
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:29.388
-Hold this.
-All right, let's go!

820
01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:33.183
-Do you believe this guy?
-Okay, all right, we're coming!

821
01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:36.895
Come on, let's go!

822
01:03:48.907 --> 01:03:50.492
You're in the way.

823
01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:54.413
What's the matter with you guys?

824
01:03:54.621 --> 01:03:56.040
<i>-Listen, buster.
-Hands off!</i>

825
01:03:56.206 --> 01:03:57.249
Now, take it easy.

826
01:03:57.416 --> 01:04:00.461
-Just want to ask you a few questions.
-Questions, huh?

827
01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:07.217
Hold him! Hold him!

828
01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:12.264
You son of a--

829
01:04:12.806 --> 01:04:14.475
In the guts, so it don't show.

830
01:04:16.518 --> 01:04:17.895
That's the way!

831
01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.068
Talk, you bastard.
Who the hell are you?

832
01:04:25.277 --> 01:04:27.196
-Number Nine.
-You crumb.

833
01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.906
-Number Nine.

834
01:04:29.114 --> 01:04:31.784
-You gonna to tell us or not?
-Go to hell.

835
01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:34.078
Hold him.

836
01:04:36.288 --> 01:04:38.290
Where the hell are your dog tags?

837
01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:40.751
I ate them.

838
01:04:40.959 --> 01:04:42.002
You ate them?

839
01:04:43.295 --> 01:04:46.256
-You gonna tell us now?
-Yeah.

840
01:04:46.757 --> 01:04:48.300
Yeah.

841
01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:52.888
-Number Nine!
-Wladislaw!

842
01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:20.791
What happened?

843
01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:25.796
They tried to make me talk.

844
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:38.475
Where have you been?

845
01:05:39.059 --> 01:05:41.770
-What happened?
-He slipped on a bar of soap.

846
01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:43.689
Everybody's slipping on soap.

847
01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:45.732
Of all the miserable--

848
01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:49.236
-Who?
-Who? Reisman.

849
01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.280
He had two paras jump him.

850
01:05:51.488 --> 01:05:53.824
-Major did this?
-Gave him a pretty hard time.

851
01:05:54.032 --> 01:05:55.951
-Well?
-Well, what?

852
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.703
Did he tell them anything?

853
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:59.496
Are you crazy?

854
01:05:59.872 --> 01:06:01.707
Three wise men.

855
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.502
"Trust your major."
I'd rather trust Hitler.

856
01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:10.549
-All right, move it out.
-Come on, move it! Move it!

857
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.559
You'll find this easier
than our jump tower.

858
01:06:21.059 --> 01:06:23.437
Action stations!

859
01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:26.899
<i>Go!</i>

860
01:07:08.398 --> 01:07:09.399
Morgan.

861
01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:11.944
-Yes, sir.
-They should be here soon.

862
01:07:12.152 --> 01:07:14.363
Gather the men.
I'll talk to them first.

863
01:07:14.571 --> 01:07:16.782
-We'll use your hut tonight.
-Our hut?

864
01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:18.033
Your hut.

865
01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.619
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

866
01:07:20.786 --> 01:07:22.287
All right, Ike and Mike.

867
01:07:22.454 --> 01:07:25.958
Come on, get on your feet.
Come on, let's go.

868
01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:27.167
Move it!

869
01:07:27.709 --> 01:07:29.795
What are you, the Gold Dust Twins?

870
01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:35.467
You need a special invitation?

871
01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:36.635
-No, sir.
-No, sir?

872
01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:38.762
-I mean, yes, sir.
-Then move it!

873
01:07:41.807 --> 01:07:45.310
That's TS, Greek.
Why don't you tell it to the chaplain?

874
01:07:46.853 --> 01:07:49.982
All right, you foul-ups, come on!
Get over to the MP hut.

875
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:52.776
The man wants to talk to you.
Come on, move it!

876
01:07:52.985 --> 01:07:54.486
All right.

877
01:07:55.153 --> 01:07:56.196
Stop pushing.

878
01:07:57.489 --> 01:08:00.158
Come on now, let's get going!

879
01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.537
So this is how the other half lives.

880
01:08:03.912 --> 01:08:05.539
Get going!

881
01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:08.208
Hey, we're not going
to the junior prom.

882
01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.378
-Pretty sweet, huh?
-No dancing. Come on, let's go!

883
01:08:14.172 --> 01:08:16.174
-They got electricity.
-Nice to be rich.

884
01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:18.719
Hey, what does he want to see us for?

885
01:08:18.927 --> 01:08:22.472
-A radio.
-Hey, look at those pictures!

886
01:08:22.681 --> 01:08:25.684
-Horny bunch of mothers.
-Wow!

887
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.856
All right, give them
a little air, boys.

888
01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:33.609
Move it, Jiminez.

889
01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.705
Okay, sarge.

890
01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.903
Well, jump school didn't kill you.
Maybe that stuff will.

891
01:09:18.236 --> 01:09:21.406
Your training's about over
and I figure that entitles you...

892
01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:25.994
...to a graduation ball or something.
You have cups and glasses.

893
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:30.332
All right, wheel them in.

894
01:09:45.222 --> 01:09:47.265
Shall I say they're your treat, sir?

895
01:09:47.432 --> 01:09:49.768
Hell, no.
Say it's part of their training.

896
01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:50.936
Yes, sir.

897
01:09:51.144 --> 01:09:52.437
Where are we?

898
01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:55.482
Oh! Somebody in this truck
has a cold nose.

899
01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.442
Get off me foot!

900
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:03.115
-Are you hurt?
-It's a limey barrack!

901
01:10:03.281 --> 01:10:05.534
I'm not one for orgies meself!

902
01:10:05.742 --> 01:10:08.870
-Should've asked for more money.
-Minx.

903
01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:12.082
You sadists!

904
01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:16.044
-Good evening.
-I'm already too worn out to work.

905
01:10:16.753 --> 01:10:19.089
-Right this way, ladies.
-Move along.

906
01:10:19.297 --> 01:10:20.799
Good evening, major.

907
01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:26.972
I only got eight. It's like cops.
If you want one, you can't find one.

908
01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:29.683
-Good evening, ladies.
-Good evening, admiral.

909
01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:37.149
Blimey, they're filthy!

910
01:10:37.315 --> 01:10:40.277
They may be, lady,
but they sure do mean well.

911
01:10:40.485 --> 01:10:42.028
Hey!

912
01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.198
All present and accounted for, major.

913
01:10:48.785 --> 01:10:52.497
You gentlemen will be on duty again
at 0600 hours.

914
01:10:53.039 --> 01:10:57.502
That's the same amount of time these
ladies have allotted to be your guests.

915
01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:03.383
In the meantime, I suggest that
you use that time to get acquainted.

916
01:11:04.134 --> 01:11:06.803
I don't believe that
Mr. Maggott cares to indulge...

917
01:11:07.012 --> 01:11:10.557
...80 I suggest you save some whiskey
for him when he gets off duty.

918
01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:12.684
Good night, gentlemen. Ladies.

919
01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:14.728
Good night, colonel.

920
01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:20.108
-Are you crazy?
-Let's go. We might inhibit them.

921
01:11:20.942 --> 01:11:22.319
You want to bet?

922
01:11:23.737 --> 01:11:26.281
Yes, you, Major Reisman!

923
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:29.201
I saw those filthy strumpets!

924
01:11:29.409 --> 01:11:33.038
You're turning this place
into a bottomless pit of vice!

925
01:11:33.371 --> 01:11:35.916
Comes Judgment Day!

926
01:11:36.124 --> 01:11:38.877
And Judgment Day is coming!

927
01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:44.591
Those men, major, they'll suffer
eternal damnation because of you!

928
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.053
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open!

929
01:11:48.261 --> 01:11:50.472
You're on guard duty, Maggott!

930
01:13:12.637 --> 01:13:13.972
Want to dance?

931
01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:15.891
There's no music.

932
01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:18.143
Try humming.

933
01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:26.568
All right, girls,
you want to lose those wraps?

934
01:13:28.945 --> 01:13:30.196
Make yourself at home.

935
01:13:31.323 --> 01:13:34.284
You think those guys realize
tomorrow's Mother's Day?

936
01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:35.869
Is it?

937
01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:44.502
Now they're doing it to music.

938
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:06.650
-This is a restricted area, sir.
- know that.

939
01:14:06.858 --> 01:14:08.360
Two groups, three ranks in.

940
01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:09.736
Open the gate.

941
01:14:09.903 --> 01:14:11.404
Come on, let's move it!

942
01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:13.323
Open this gate.

943
01:14:13.698 --> 01:14:14.908
Yes, sir.

944
01:14:19.371 --> 01:14:20.705
Hey, look at those guys.

945
01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.583
You can't come in here, sir!

946
01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:26.169
Sergeant, take his weapon.

947
01:14:26.878 --> 01:14:28.296
Take his weapon.

948
01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:33.718
Corporal Morgan. Sergeant,
get that rabble in some kind of order.

949
01:14:33.885 --> 01:14:35.971
Yes, sir. Commander, man to man!

950
01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:38.682
Sir, you are contravening
a direct order.

951
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:40.058
Contravening nothing!

952
01:14:40.517 --> 01:14:43.311
Fall in with the rest.
Speak when you're spoken to.

953
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.981
You heard what the colonel said.
Fall in!

954
01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:47.983
Come on, move it!

955
01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.903
You heard what he said. Fall in!

956
01:14:52.112 --> 01:14:55.031
Come on, come on!
Let's get the lead out.

957
01:14:55.407 --> 01:14:56.908
What's he all upset about?

958
01:14:57.075 --> 01:15:00.078
All right, you bunch of foul-ups.
Grab a formation.

959
01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:03.248
Fall in there!
Come on, you yard birds!

960
01:15:03.456 --> 01:15:05.792
You believe this Army?
We gotta be losing.

961
01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:08.920
Move it! What's wrong with you?
You got lead in them?

962
01:15:09.462 --> 01:15:10.922
Come on, get going!

963
01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:14.592
Hey, ain't those the jokers that
roughed you up in the latrine?

964
01:15:16.636 --> 01:15:17.929
Come on, pick it up!

965
01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:21.766
Yeah, we had Reisman all wrong.

966
01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:24.936
-Come on, move it!
-Not now. Wait for it.

967
01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:28.565
What's going on up there?

968
01:15:28.773 --> 01:15:31.067
Hey, you!
What are you, something special?

969
01:15:31.276 --> 01:15:32.652
We gotta wait all day?

970
01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.446
Come on!

971
01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:39.284
Get in position there!
Let's try and make a straight line.

972
01:15:39.492 --> 01:15:41.119
Let's look like soldiers, huh?

973
01:15:44.622 --> 01:15:48.251
I told you nobody could pass!
Now open the gate. Let's get going!

974
01:15:52.505 --> 01:15:55.842
Those are the two guys
that got Wladislaw.

975
01:15:56.926 --> 01:15:59.971
Those are the two guys that
gave Wladislaw his lumps.

976
01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:03.433
Those are the two guys
that jumped Wladislaw.

977
01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:06.644
Those are the two guys
that banged Wladislaw.

978
01:16:06.811 --> 01:16:09.689
Those two gorillas beat up Wladislaw.

979
01:16:10.815 --> 01:16:12.525
Those are the two guys--

980
01:16:31.336 --> 01:16:32.921
In my opinion...

981
01:16:33.463 --> 01:16:37.300
...the officer in command
of this operation...

982
01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:42.222
...has either disregarded his orders
or is flagrantly disobeying them...

983
01:16:42.722 --> 01:16:44.307
...one way or the other.

984
01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:47.185
And that is what I am here to find out.

985
01:16:49.062 --> 01:16:50.063
All right...

986
01:16:51.856 --> 01:16:55.735
...gentlemen,
let's understand each other.

987
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:59.864
I'm here to find out exactly
what this is all about...

988
01:17:00.073 --> 01:17:03.535
...and I intend to do it
if it takes all day.

989
01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:07.872
You can make it easy or tough
on yourself. That's up to you.

990
01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:14.045
Before I leave, we're going to find
out who's involved in this insanity...

991
01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:17.423
...what you're doing here and why.

992
01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:20.260
Is that understood?

993
01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:24.097
All right, general.

994
01:17:28.768 --> 01:17:32.522
-Your name, rank and serial number.
-You tell him, we've all had it!

995
01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:34.065
Quiet!

996
01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:38.736
What's your name, soldier?

997
01:17:39.487 --> 01:17:41.489
Number Two, sir.

998
01:17:47.453 --> 01:17:49.122
Morgan. Clayton.

999
01:17:49.914 --> 01:17:51.207
Yes, sir?

1000
01:17:51.916 --> 01:17:55.461
Give Clayton his name, rank and
serial number. For all of them.

1001
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:58.715
- I don't know that, sir.
-Then tell him what you do know.

1002
01:17:58.882 --> 01:18:00.508
You fink, tell him nothing!

1003
01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:03.720
-What was that talk down there?
-Nothing, sir.

1004
01:18:05.346 --> 01:18:07.015
Come here, soldier.

1005
01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:24.866
When did you bathe last?

1006
01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:29.162
- I don't remember, sir.
-You're filthy.

1007
01:18:30.121 --> 01:18:32.248
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

1008
01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:34.667
Fredericks, get a razor and water.

1009
01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:38.922
He will demonstrate proper procedure
for shaving and bathing in the field.

1010
01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:41.090
-Yes, sir.
-Right, soldier?

1011
01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:42.759
No, sir!

1012
01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:44.344
No, sir, what?

1013
01:18:44.552 --> 01:18:47.847
No, sir, I am not going to shave, sir!

1014
01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:52.518
Then we'll have to do it the hard way.
Clayton. Blake. Dry-shave him!

1015
01:18:53.561 --> 01:18:54.604
Now!

1016
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.663
-Reisman!
-That's right!

1017
01:19:12.205 --> 01:19:15.166
Have your men dispose
of their weapons!

1018
01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:16.459
Sergeant Bowren!

1019
01:19:18.294 --> 01:19:21.589
Get some special help
and get those weapons!

1020
01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:24.676
Yes, sir.
All right, you heard the man!

1021
01:19:24.884 --> 01:19:26.177
Now get moving!

1022
01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:28.346
Hit them only where it hurts.

1023
01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:32.183
-Turn it loose!
-That's great.

1024
01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:34.686
-Pull them loose.
-I'm sorry, sergeant.

1025
01:19:34.894 --> 01:19:36.479
You Nazi!

1026
01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:58.042
I'm with you, major, all the way!

1027
01:20:05.216 --> 01:20:07.719
Don't call us, we'll call you.

1028
01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:10.513
You must be out of your mind!

1029
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.515
It might seem that way.

1030
01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:20.481
Take it all back, colonel.
They aren't pretty.

1031
01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:21.899
They're all 4-Fs!

1032
01:20:22.066 --> 01:20:25.069
Hey, colonel, I hear they
don't even use parachutes!

1033
01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:32.452
Hey, colonel, you crybaby!

1034
01:20:34.245 --> 01:20:36.205
Don't just stand there, pick it up!

1035
01:20:36.414 --> 01:20:39.000
-Stick around for tea.
-Put some money in there.

1036
01:20:39.208 --> 01:20:40.668
Come again, colonel!

1037
01:20:40.877 --> 01:20:43.421
Stop by any time, bozo.

1038
01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:49.218
I'm sure you look upon your service
record as being highly colorful.

1039
01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:51.429
Well, that's not my view of it.

1040
01:20:52.096 --> 01:20:55.391
You know I was never in favor
of you leading this operation.

1041
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.353
So I can't say I'm disappointed
in your performance.

1042
01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:02.440
The impression you gave me was
very unfavorable in the first place.

1043
01:21:03.316 --> 01:21:05.943
You act as if this
were a personal matter.

1044
01:21:06.527 --> 01:21:08.321
Let me assure you, it isn't.

1045
01:21:08.529 --> 01:21:11.783
What happens to you is something
to which I am indifferent.

1046
01:21:11.949 --> 01:21:14.786
But the nature of the operation
I am running is not.

1047
01:21:15.703 --> 01:21:17.872
Colonel Breed's report
on your achievement...

1048
01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:22.335
...and general behavior at the
parachute training school is negative.

1049
01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:27.006
It would justify my recommendation
that this operation be canceled.

1050
01:21:28.007 --> 01:21:30.426
Your men will be sent back
for execution of sentence.

1051
01:21:32.136 --> 01:21:34.722
Whether you'll be
disciplined personally...

1052
01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:36.766
...is a matter for General Worden.

1053
01:21:37.809 --> 01:21:40.561
Do you deny your responsibility
for the fact that...

1054
01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:44.941
...on the night of April 14-15, a
military establishment of the U.S. Army...

1055
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:46.984
...was the scene of a drunken party...

1056
01:21:47.151 --> 01:21:50.613
...at which no less than seven
female civilians took an active part?

1057
01:21:50.822 --> 01:21:53.616
Oh, yes, sir, they took
an active part all right.

1058
01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.661
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1059
01:21:57.578 --> 01:22:00.957
Can you offer even the remotest
mitigating circumstances?

1060
01:22:01.165 --> 01:22:03.668
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, sergeant, more ice.

1061
01:22:03.876 --> 01:22:05.336
Yes, sir.

1062
01:22:05.628 --> 01:22:06.838
Well?

1063
01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:11.008
The men had a chance to get off
the hook. They've worked hard.

1064
01:22:11.175 --> 01:22:15.138
Now that they're shaping up,
you're gonna say, "The deal's off'?

1065
01:22:15.304 --> 01:22:19.183
You've only yourself to blame.
You brought those women to camp.

1066
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:24.021
So you're gonna Kill five men
and send the rest to prison for life?

1067
01:22:24.188 --> 01:22:26.274
Because if you did that...

1068
01:22:26.482 --> 01:22:30.278
...you'd have to lock up half
the United States Army, officers included.

1069
01:22:30.486 --> 01:22:35.158
Besides, it was my fault.
It doesn't affect their ability as soldiers.

1070
01:22:35.366 --> 01:22:38.953
Yes, well, we've heard about their
abilities from Colonel Breed.

1071
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:40.746
That's his opinion.

1072
01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:44.959
My men have crammed six months of
intensive training into as many weeks.

1073
01:22:45.168 --> 01:22:48.463
As of now, I'd stack them
up against any men in the Army.

1074
01:22:48.921 --> 01:22:50.506
You can't be serious.

1075
01:22:50.715 --> 01:22:53.301
Damn right I am!
They might not be pretty...

1076
01:22:53.509 --> 01:22:55.887
...but any one of mine
Is worth 10 of yours!

1077
01:22:56.095 --> 01:22:59.307
-That's hardly the point.
-It's precisely the point.

1078
01:22:59.515 --> 01:23:03.186
I contend my men are more than able
to handle any job given them.

1079
01:23:03.686 --> 01:23:07.148
You gentlemen set this thing up.
You promised them a chance.

1080
01:23:07.356 --> 01:23:10.067
At least let them show you
their capabilities.

1081
01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:12.570
I shudder to think
what they're capable of.

1082
01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:13.738
Let them prove it!

1083
01:23:13.946 --> 01:23:16.574
If they fail,
your conscience is clear.

1084
01:23:17.408 --> 01:23:19.035
Tell me, major...

1085
01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:22.330
...just how would you
have your men "prove it"?

1086
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.126
It can't be done, can it?

1087
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.511
Well, yes. I suppose it could.

1088
01:23:37.553 --> 01:23:39.305
I mean, there might be a way.

1089
01:23:40.431 --> 01:23:42.808
What I mean is, general, if you recall...

1090
01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:45.728
...we have divisional maneuvers
in Devonshire.

1091
01:23:45.895 --> 01:23:47.104
Yes, yes, yes.

1092
01:23:47.271 --> 01:23:50.566
Colonel Breed's outfit will be
part of that exercise.

1093
01:23:51.067 --> 01:23:53.861
As a matter of fact,
one of his companies...

1094
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:58.115
...has been assigned the defense
of divisional headquarters.

1095
01:23:58.324 --> 01:23:59.325
So?

1096
01:24:01.452 --> 01:24:02.912
So...

1097
01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:08.042
So, you let my 12 men act
as an independent unit...

1098
01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:10.378
...attached to the opposing force.

1099
01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:15.424
They'll knock out Breed's headquarters
and capture his entire staff.

1100
01:24:17.635 --> 01:24:19.053
That I'd like to see!

1101
01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.138
So would 1!

1102
01:24:45.288 --> 01:24:48.332
Charlie and Fox Companies
will support the backwoods.

1103
01:24:48.499 --> 01:24:50.710
They'll be aided
by the 2nd Battalion.

1104
01:24:50.918 --> 01:24:53.713
Rogers won't like it,
but I don't want to hear it.

1105
01:24:53.921 --> 01:24:56.173
-Yes, sir.
-How's Johnson's armor?

1106
01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.677
They just ran through two minutes ago.
The armor's all set.

1107
01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.061
Hold it!

1108
01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:16.902
Change!

1109
01:25:36.589 --> 01:25:38.507
Think we'll get away with this?

1110
01:25:38.966 --> 01:25:43.387
Smile, you idiots! If those blue
slobs recognize us, we're in trouble.

1111
01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.575
Would you believe it? They shaved.

1112
01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:07.578
How about that?

1113
01:26:07.995 --> 01:26:10.915
Get a load of the major.
He can't believe we made it.

1114
01:26:11.123 --> 01:26:14.418
-Day go fast, major?
-Just beautiful. But you're late.

1115
01:26:14.585 --> 01:26:16.712
-Got everything you need?
-Absolutely.

1116
01:26:16.879 --> 01:26:18.923
Think you can remember the plan?

1117
01:26:19.423 --> 01:26:21.717
-Where'd you get the vehicle?
-We stole it.

1118
01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:24.303
Like we're gonna
steal everything else.

1119
01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:27.139
We're playing war games.
Anything else, sir?

1120
01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:31.018
I guess not. All right, we'll be
with the generals at headquarters.

1121
01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:34.146
From now on, you're on your own.
Take off and good luck.

1122
01:26:34.605 --> 01:26:36.107
Let's move!

1123
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:40.194
All right, split up into three groups.

1124
01:26:54.333 --> 01:26:56.293
These two belong to you?

1125
01:27:12.309 --> 01:27:13.644
Where's General Worden?

1126
01:27:13.853 --> 01:27:16.272
He's gone to check up in the field, sir.

1127
01:27:17.523 --> 01:27:19.275
Oh, my God...

1128
01:27:27.324 --> 01:27:30.119
-Well?
-Be with you in a minute, sir.

1129
01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:38.836
-Well, how about this one?
-Yes, sir. I think that's it, sir.

1130
01:27:40.337 --> 01:27:44.091
Oh, that's excellent, Haskell, excellent!

1131
01:27:44.967 --> 01:27:46.302
Come on, let's go.

1132
01:28:04.236 --> 01:28:06.238
-We made it.
-Where are the others?

1133
01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:09.366
845. Four of them should
come over that ridge soon.

1134
01:28:09.533 --> 01:28:12.453
08457 They'd better
be coming fast then.

1135
01:28:12.661 --> 01:28:16.207
Don't you know the enemy's planned
a barrage on that ridge at 08507

1136
01:28:16.415 --> 01:28:17.875
Yes, sir, I know that.

1137
01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:21.045
That's the one place Colonel Breed
won't look for them.

1138
01:28:24.131 --> 01:28:26.717
-Are they all set?
-All set, sir.

1139
01:28:26.884 --> 01:28:30.387
Batteries one, three and four
open fire and continue at will.

1140
01:28:30.596 --> 01:28:34.433
Batteries one, three and four
open fire and continue at will.

1141
01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.227
Batteries one, three and four--

1142
01:28:39.146 --> 01:28:40.815
Ready!

1143
01:28:41.023 --> 01:28:42.525
Aim!

1144
01:28:42.733 --> 01:28:43.818
Fire!

1145
01:28:50.783 --> 01:28:51.909
Come on!

1146
01:28:52.117 --> 01:28:54.578
Let's go! Come on!

1147
01:29:09.718 --> 01:29:11.303
Load!

1148
01:29:13.639 --> 01:29:14.640
Now, come on!

1149
01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:17.643
-While they're reloading!
-Let's go!

1150
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.729
Down!

1151
01:29:40.332 --> 01:29:41.750
Secure guns!

1152
01:29:41.959 --> 01:29:43.961
All right, let's go!

1153
01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:52.011
Let's go.

1154
01:29:59.768 --> 01:30:01.979
What the hell were you
guys waiting for?

1155
01:30:02.146 --> 01:30:05.691
Why, what do you mean, "waiting"?

1156
01:30:07.318 --> 01:30:10.654
Those lovers were trying
to kill us back there!

1157
01:30:13.032 --> 01:30:14.241
Change.

1158
01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:17.828
Change? What do you mean, "change"?

1159
01:30:18.537 --> 01:30:19.663
You can't do that!

1160
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:23.000
It's all right, major.
We're gonna change back later.

1161
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.502
They can't stop us now.

1162
01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:27.338
Let's go.

1163
01:30:27.838 --> 01:30:29.590
Come on.

1164
01:30:30.674 --> 01:30:31.675
We're on our way.

1165
01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:44.688
We get across this road, take 10.

1166
01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:55.282
What are we waiting here for?

1167
01:30:55.699 --> 01:30:58.327
For a jeep, a heavy machine gun,
and four men.

1168
01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.581
Like this one?

1169
01:31:03.415 --> 01:31:04.416
Slow down.

1170
01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:06.627
Ten-hut!

1171
01:31:14.301 --> 01:31:15.844
Good afternoon, general.

1172
01:31:25.562 --> 01:31:27.231
The Mafia has landed!

1173
01:31:27.439 --> 01:31:29.566
Whatever Franko says, Franko does!

1174
01:31:29.775 --> 01:31:31.527
Let's get it out. Move it out.

1175
01:31:31.735 --> 01:31:33.612
-Come on, snap it up.
-Franko, out!

1176
01:31:34.196 --> 01:31:36.115
Out! What do you mean, "out"?

1177
01:31:36.323 --> 01:31:39.326
-Who do you think stole this thing?
-You did, my boy.

1178
01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:44.081
You and Pinkley are the only guys
that Colonel Breed got a good look at!

1179
01:31:44.331 --> 01:31:47.292
This is a big enough risk
without you coming along.

1180
01:31:47.459 --> 01:31:49.753
-Out.
-Come on, Franko.

1181
01:31:51.588 --> 01:31:54.258
Jefferson, show up
with the ambulance by 0930.

1182
01:31:54.425 --> 01:31:56.635
You're late,
I'll figure you got nailed.

1183
01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.096
-Then we'll take a whack at Plan B.
-Right.

1184
01:32:00.222 --> 01:32:01.932
So long, major.

1185
01:32:04.727 --> 01:32:06.979
Hold on, Maggott.
Don't want to lose you now.

1186
01:32:09.481 --> 01:32:11.567
Attention!

1187
01:32:12.943 --> 01:32:14.445
Attention.

1188
01:32:16.447 --> 01:32:17.448
Ten-hut!

1189
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.494
-Morning, Breed.
-Morning. Quite a surprise.

1190
01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:25.664
-Everything under control?
-You could say that, sir.

1191
01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:28.751
Good. At ease, gentlemen, at ease.

1192
01:32:28.959 --> 01:32:32.254
Just thought I'd drop by to see
how things are shaping up.

1193
01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:34.965
So this is what it looks like?

1194
01:32:40.179 --> 01:32:42.139
Come on, push!

1195
01:32:45.768 --> 01:32:48.395
-Posey, remember, you're hurt.
-Oh, I'm dying.

1196
01:32:48.604 --> 01:32:49.772
Come on, Maggott.

1197
01:32:52.191 --> 01:32:53.817
Stand back, now.

1198
01:33:03.994 --> 01:33:06.121
-What's that?
-Over there!

1199
01:33:08.165 --> 01:33:11.585
-What was that?
-Down the road, sir. See that smoke?

1200
01:33:11.835 --> 01:33:14.671
-Sergeant, have somebody take a look.
-Yes, sir.

1201
01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.175
-What are they doing at that ridge?
- I don't know, sir.

1202
01:33:18.383 --> 01:33:21.845
That should've been cleared
half an hour ago.

1203
01:33:22.012 --> 01:33:25.349
Colonel, it sure doesn't look like
it's been cleared, does it?

1204
01:33:25.516 --> 01:33:26.517
Let's go.

1205
01:33:31.396 --> 01:33:33.315
-Remember, you're injured.
-Don't worry.

1206
01:33:33.524 --> 01:33:34.900
You forgot the ketchup.

1207
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.027
-Help!
-Come on.

1208
01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:53.794
Sir?

1209
01:33:57.589 --> 01:34:00.592
We got a man that's hurt bad.
We'd like an ambulance.

1210
01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:02.886
Call an ambulance. See what happened.

1211
01:34:03.053 --> 01:34:04.304
Yes, sir. Come on, you two.

1212
01:34:04.471 --> 01:34:05.722
Private?

1213
01:34:06.098 --> 01:34:08.183
-Come here.
-Yes, sir.

1214
01:34:08.392 --> 01:34:10.060
What were you doing on that road?

1215
01:34:10.227 --> 01:34:12.479
Our jeep got a flat tire.
We went into a ditch.

1216
01:34:13.564 --> 01:34:17.442
I didn't ask you that. I asked you
what you were doing on that road.

1217
01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.820
Spotting for the Field Artillery, sir.

1218
01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.701
Let's see that map.

1219
01:34:25.868 --> 01:34:27.494
Move able Charlie Company to...

1220
01:34:27.703 --> 01:34:29.580
...the bridge under smoke screen.

1221
01:34:29.746 --> 01:34:33.959
Baker Company bank towards
the ridge at 1420 hours.

1222
01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:37.462
-Private? Come here.
-Yes, sir.

1223
01:34:39.756 --> 01:34:41.216
What's your name and outfit?

1224
01:34:41.425 --> 01:34:42.885
Private Matthew Donald, sir.

1225
01:34:43.093 --> 01:34:48.098
Serial number 726256.
Battery B, 526th Field Artillery, sir.

1226
01:34:48.265 --> 01:34:51.268
-Where are your orders?
-Right here, sir.

1227
01:34:52.936 --> 01:34:54.062
From Captain Thornhill.

1228
01:34:58.192 --> 01:35:00.986
I know most of the men
under my command.

1229
01:35:02.362 --> 01:35:04.281
I don't recall seeing you before.

1230
01:35:04.615 --> 01:35:07.576
No, sir.
I was transferred in last week, sir.

1231
01:35:11.788 --> 01:35:15.834
We're getting congested at point B.
Two forces have mined the road.

1232
01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:17.544
-Where's Peterson?
-Here it comes!

1233
01:35:22.174 --> 01:35:23.842
Clear the way!

1234
01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:25.719
Looks like somebody got hurt.

1235
01:35:28.847 --> 01:35:30.474
Watch it there!

1236
01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:34.228
Okay, let's have some help
with this soldier.

1237
01:35:35.812 --> 01:35:38.982
Count of three, lift. One, two, lift.

1238
01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.902
Take it easy now.

1239
01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:47.199
-Where do we put him, sir?
-Put him there.

1240
01:35:49.993 --> 01:35:53.622
-You can stay, but keep out of the way.
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1241
01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:25.529
Sorry, but this is the end
of the line for you.

1242
01:36:25.696 --> 01:36:27.864
But we got a bad accident
down here, sir.

1243
01:36:28.073 --> 01:36:32.035
That's too bad, because you just
became prisoners of war.

1244
01:36:36.039 --> 01:36:37.291
It's the enemy, sir!

1245
01:36:37.541 --> 01:36:39.376
All right, come on, let's go.

1246
01:36:40.752 --> 01:36:42.546
Let's go, let's go.

1247
01:36:44.673 --> 01:36:46.341
They can't do that.

1248
01:36:49.094 --> 01:36:50.721
You're wearing Red Force insignia.

1249
01:36:51.221 --> 01:36:53.724
That's right. We're traitors.

1250
01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:56.310
-Watch my finger.
-These aren't real bullets, idiot!

1251
01:36:56.518 --> 01:36:58.353
Look here, I'm a doctor, major.

1252
01:36:58.562 --> 01:37:00.856
And I'm a major, captain.

1253
01:37:01.064 --> 01:37:02.899
Yes, but we had a radio message.

1254
01:37:03.066 --> 01:37:04.735
There's a man badly hurt down there.

1255
01:37:04.901 --> 01:37:05.902
Hurry it up!

1256
01:37:06.069 --> 01:37:08.822
Here's our permission to cross
all roadblocks.

1257
01:37:09.406 --> 01:37:12.909
Very cute idea, captain.
But it won't work. Get out.

1258
01:37:13.243 --> 01:37:17.039
But it's not a gag, sir.
There's a real casualty there.

1259
01:37:17.247 --> 01:37:18.665
All set back here, Jefferson.

1260
01:37:18.874 --> 01:37:21.209
Sir, will you explain
the rules to him?

1261
01:37:21.376 --> 01:37:22.461
The man may be dying.

1262
01:37:22.627 --> 01:37:25.255
I'm just an observer, captain,
not an umpire.

1263
01:37:25.464 --> 01:37:28.091
I can't interfere or make any rulings.

1264
01:37:28.675 --> 01:37:31.094
Come on, doc,
I've got a sick tree back here.

1265
01:37:31.261 --> 01:37:32.929
Come on, you too.

1266
01:37:33.138 --> 01:37:36.516
She's blond, she's engaged.
Come on, sugar!

1267
01:37:36.725 --> 01:37:40.604
-Got your patient right here, doc.
-What's the matter?

1268
01:37:43.732 --> 01:37:45.442
You're really gonna enjoy this.

1269
01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.030
How about this patient, doc?

1270
01:37:53.283 --> 01:37:54.951
Come on, men. What about 09307

1271
01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.038
Take out the blue bands! Let's go.

1272
01:37:58.246 --> 01:37:59.664
Change to the blue armband!

1273
01:37:59.873 --> 01:38:01.041
What about the prisoners?

1274
01:38:01.249 --> 01:38:03.752
We can't spare men
to look after prisoners.

1275
01:38:05.462 --> 01:38:06.755
You coming?

1276
01:38:25.816 --> 01:38:28.402
-Is he trying to kill us?
-We must be going 120.

1277
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:30.487
He's gonna squash us in this can.

1278
01:38:30.695 --> 01:38:34.866
-You want to be there by 09307
-Yeah.

1279
01:38:35.283 --> 01:38:39.329
Pull them back to map reference 397492.

1280
01:38:39.538 --> 01:38:40.872
Let Blue Force through.

1281
01:38:41.832 --> 01:38:45.001
Call in company orders
and hit them at the crossroads.

1282
01:38:45.168 --> 01:38:46.420
Hello, Able 3.

1283
01:38:46.628 --> 01:38:49.381
Don't worry, Bill.
We called for the ambulance.

1284
01:39:03.353 --> 01:39:06.273
-It's gonna be all right.
-Yes, it will.

1285
01:39:07.732 --> 01:39:09.568
It's gonna be all right.

1286
01:39:09.818 --> 01:39:13.864
I want to strike on Hill 80
between them at 1400 hours.

1287
01:39:14.072 --> 01:39:17.033
Move them up to the hill
with their heads down.

1288
01:39:17.242 --> 01:39:21.913
Well, thanks very much, colonel.
It's been very instructive.

1289
01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:25.333
I think I'll take a ride now
and get the overall picture.

1290
01:39:25.542 --> 01:39:27.252
Yes, sir, thank you.

1291
01:39:37.721 --> 01:39:39.598
Move it over. Give them room.

1292
01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:23.433
Forward observation report.
Blue Force tanks approaching...

1293
01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.477
...airfield at map reference--

1294
01:40:26.728 --> 01:40:28.104
Out of the way!

1295
01:40:37.489 --> 01:40:38.782
Watch out for the ambulance!

1296
01:40:47.999 --> 01:40:50.919
There he is. The old man!

1297
01:40:55.131 --> 01:40:56.716
Come on, observers!

1298
01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:09.479
Major Reisman's compliments, sir.

1299
01:41:18.154 --> 01:41:22.784
Hey, major. What do you think
about that one, major?

1300
01:41:22.993 --> 01:41:24.327
I didn't tell you before...

1301
01:41:24.494 --> 01:41:26.288
...because it might make you nervous.

1302
01:41:26.871 --> 01:41:30.083
After our last party,
the generals were all in favor...

1303
01:41:30.292 --> 01:41:32.586
...of sending you to finish
your sentences.

1304
01:41:32.794 --> 01:41:34.754
Or get hung.

1305
01:41:34.963 --> 01:41:35.964
Or get hung.

1306
01:41:36.464 --> 01:41:38.341
But I made a deal with them.

1307
01:41:38.717 --> 01:41:42.804
Knocking off Breed's headquarters
Is what got you off the hook.

1308
01:41:47.017 --> 01:41:49.019
You weren't really worried,
were you, major?

1309
01:41:49.185 --> 01:41:50.854
No, not much, he wasn't.

1310
01:41:51.062 --> 01:41:53.356
But we still have one operation to go.

1311
01:41:53.523 --> 01:41:58.111
If you guys foul up on this one,
none of us will ever play the violin again.

1312
01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.655
Because up until now,
it's all been a game.

1313
01:42:00.864 --> 01:42:03.366
But as of tomorrow night,
it'll be the real thing.

1314
01:42:03.533 --> 01:42:05.660
If you want to know how real,
I'll tell you.

1315
01:42:05.869 --> 01:42:08.913
It's my guess that a lot of you
won't be coming back.

1316
01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:11.374
But there's no sense in squawking
about that.

1317
01:42:11.541 --> 01:42:13.084
The Army never did love you.

1318
01:42:13.293 --> 01:42:15.170
Besides, you all volunteered, right?

1319
01:42:15.378 --> 01:42:18.131
-Yeah.
-Well, that's more than I did.

1320
01:42:19.049 --> 01:42:20.592
Sergeant Bowren.

1321
01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:24.054
We've been over this a thousand times...

1322
01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.057
...but a lot can go wrong.
We have to be ready to improvise.

1323
01:42:27.223 --> 01:42:30.310
Let's see what happens if everything
goes right. Ready?

1324
01:42:30.518 --> 01:42:33.313
-One.
-At the roadblock we've just begun.

1325
01:42:33.521 --> 01:42:37.025
-One.
-At the roadblock we've just begun.

1326
01:42:37.233 --> 01:42:39.527
-Two.
-The guards are through.

1327
01:42:39.736 --> 01:42:42.864
-Three.
-The major's men are on a spree.

1328
01:42:43.073 --> 01:42:46.201
-Four.
-Major and Wladislaw go through the door.

1329
01:42:46.409 --> 01:42:49.913
-Five.
-Pinkley stays out in the drive.

1330
01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.500
-Six.
-The major gives the rope a fix.

1331
01:42:53.708 --> 01:42:56.920
-Seven.
-Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.

1332
01:42:57.754 --> 01:43:01.174
-Eight.
-Jiminez has got a date.

1333
01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:05.303
-Nine.
-The other guys go up the line.

1334
01:43:06.096 --> 01:43:09.724
-Ten.
-Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.

1335
01:43:09.933 --> 01:43:13.228
-Eleven.
-Posey guards points five and seven.

1336
01:43:13.895 --> 01:43:17.816
-Twelve.
-Wladislaw and major go down to delve.

1337
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.609
And where's Donald Duck?

1338
01:43:20.610 --> 01:43:23.238
Donald Duck's at the crossroads
with a machine gun.

1339
01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:26.408
He'd better not be asleep,
or we'll all be in trouble.

1340
01:43:28.326 --> 01:43:32.038
-Thirteen.
-Franko goes up without being seen.

1341
01:43:32.664 --> 01:43:34.749
-Fourteen.
-Zero hour.

1342
01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:39.754
Mayonnaise cuts the cable,
Franko cuts the phone.

1343
01:43:39.963 --> 01:43:43.216
-Fifteen.
-Franko goes in where the others have been.

1344
01:43:43.633 --> 01:43:47.971
-Sixteen.
-We all come out like it's Halloween.

1345
01:43:49.514 --> 01:43:51.349
And kill every officer in sight.

1346
01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:52.976
Ours or theirs?

1347
01:43:53.143 --> 01:43:54.978
Let's start off with theirs, huh?

1348
01:43:55.186 --> 01:43:57.772
Take it again from the top,
without the ad libs.

1349
01:43:57.981 --> 01:44:01.609
-One.
-Down the roadblock, we've just begun.

1350
01:44:01.818 --> 01:44:04.696
-Two.
-The guards are through.

1351
01:44:04.904 --> 01:44:08.241
-Three.
-The major's men are on a spree.

1352
01:44:09.033 --> 01:44:11.077
-Fourteen.
-Zero hour.

1353
01:44:11.286 --> 01:44:14.164
-And?
-Mayonnaise cuts the cable...

1354
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:16.040
...Franko cuts the phone.

1355
01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:19.961
-Fifteen.
-Franko goes in where the others have been.

1356
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:24.632
-Sixteen.
-We all come out like it's Halloween.

1357
01:44:24.841 --> 01:44:26.718
Seventeen?

1358
01:44:26.926 --> 01:44:29.721
Seventeen. D-day.

1359
01:44:30.305 --> 01:44:33.141
We get out as best we can
and make our way to the coast.

1360
01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:37.604
And hope the entire invasion
hasn't been a total disaster.

1361
01:44:37.812 --> 01:44:40.106
Otherwise, we've got a long swim home.

1362
01:44:40.690 --> 01:44:42.400
How much longer, major?

1363
01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:44.027
I'll ask the driver.

1364
01:44:51.034 --> 01:44:53.703
You're not worried about jumping
at night, are you?

1365
01:44:56.372 --> 01:44:57.874
Getting back.

1366
01:45:05.548 --> 01:45:06.549
Ready.

1367
01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:12.764
Cargo...

1368
01:45:24.192 --> 01:45:25.193
Go.

1369
01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:42.168
Where have you been? We're late.

1370
01:45:42.585 --> 01:45:43.920
Looking for Jiminez.

1371
01:45:45.004 --> 01:45:47.257
We found him hung up in an apple tree.

1372
01:45:47.465 --> 01:45:50.260
-His neck's broken.
-You mean he's dead?

1373
01:45:50.426 --> 01:45:52.720
That's exactly what I mean.

1374
01:45:54.973 --> 01:45:56.266
-This far.
-Yeah.

1375
01:45:59.185 --> 01:46:02.522
Franko, now you know why we
all checked out on that rope.

1376
01:46:06.442 --> 01:46:08.027
Gilpin, number eight.

1377
01:46:08.236 --> 01:46:10.321
Gilpin, did you hear me?

1378
01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:13.116
-Eight.
-Gilpin's got a date?

1379
01:46:16.286 --> 01:46:18.371
-Fourteen.
-Zero hour.

1380
01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.790
-And?
-Gilpin cuts the cables...

1381
01:46:20.999 --> 01:46:23.418
-...Franko cuts the phone.
-Let's go.

1382
01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:35.930
-What a great way to start out, huh?
-Yeah.

1383
01:47:44.123 --> 01:47:46.000
So far, so good, major.

1384
01:48:50.314 --> 01:48:52.191
Where are those guys?

1385
01:48:54.652 --> 01:48:56.112
Here they come.

1386
01:48:58.656 --> 01:49:00.158
Let's go.

1387
01:49:17.008 --> 01:49:18.968
Come on, Pinkley, let's go.

1388
01:49:54.295 --> 01:49:57.131
It's just like the major
said it would be.

1389
01:49:57.548 --> 01:50:01.052
Yeah, really some spread, ain't it?

1390
01:50:02.887 --> 01:50:04.347
There they go.

1391
01:50:24.826 --> 01:50:27.745
-No blackout?
-Think they're expecting us?

1392
01:50:27.954 --> 01:50:29.622
Hey, the silencer!

1393
01:51:44.113 --> 01:51:45.323
Let's go.

1394
01:52:42.505 --> 01:52:44.215
"Radio room."

1395
01:53:03.693 --> 01:53:06.362
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

1396
01:53:09.657 --> 01:53:11.617
I don't know how many we'll kill...

1397
01:53:11.826 --> 01:53:14.036
...but we'll make
an awful lot of noise.

1398
01:53:15.705 --> 01:53:18.040
Hey, do you believe
in stuff like that?

1399
01:53:19.333 --> 01:53:21.377
I don't know, can't hurt nothing.

1400
01:53:22.545 --> 01:53:24.797
I don't think I believe
in stuff like that.

1401
01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:26.484
-So how's your German holding up?
-Oh, man, I don't know.

1402
01:54:26.692 --> 01:54:29.111
You know those two guys at the stairs?

1403
01:54:29.278 --> 01:54:30.946
I couldn't understand a word.

1404
01:54:31.155 --> 01:54:34.283
-Just act mean and grunt, huh?
-Yeah.

1405
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:37.745
Okay, Room 11.

1406
01:55:06.357 --> 01:55:07.566
So?

1407
01:55:08.567 --> 01:55:11.112
You go first, I'll carry the bags.

1408
01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.808
We'll set it up here.

1409
01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:28.564
-They should've been here by now.
-Yeah.

1410
01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:12.107
Guard.

1411
01:57:31.293 --> 01:57:33.337
I left the rope.

1412
01:58:34.857 --> 01:58:36.358
Hold it.

1413
01:58:50.289 --> 01:58:51.874
Idiot.

1414
01:58:54.793 --> 01:58:57.129
-Stupid Polack.
-Shut up.

1415
01:59:01.717 --> 01:59:03.093
Hurry up!

1416
01:59:42.591 --> 01:59:43.967
Now.

1417
01:59:46.261 --> 01:59:47.721
Now.

1418
02:00:01.443 --> 02:00:03.112
Ready for the turkey shoot?

1419
02:01:09.052 --> 02:01:11.597
I wish I could read this.
Think it's dirty?

1420
02:02:56.118 --> 02:02:57.953
Hey! What are you doing?

1421
02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:01.623
Franko and the others
are still down there. Come on!

1422
02:03:41.663 --> 02:03:42.831
Hey, Maggott.

1423
02:03:42.998 --> 02:03:45.417
What are you doing?
Get out of sight.

1424
02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.133
Wolfgang?

1425
02:05:17.968 --> 02:05:18.969
Wolfgang?

1426
02:05:22.514 --> 02:05:23.515
Wolfgang?

1427
02:06:56.525 --> 02:06:59.361
Scream, you bitch.

1428
02:07:01.905 --> 02:07:03.323
Scream.

1429
02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:07.410
Scream, you slut.

1430
02:07:07.702 --> 02:07:09.830
Sprechen, you harlot.

1431
02:07:10.122 --> 02:07:11.414
Scream.

1432
02:07:35.397 --> 02:07:36.690
Radio room.

1433
02:08:53.183 --> 02:08:54.226
Blow it!

1434
02:08:54.434 --> 02:08:55.977
Blow it!

1435
02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:45.360
-Hey, what's going on?
-Shut up.

1436
02:11:00.101 --> 02:11:02.645
It's judgment day, you sinners.

1437
02:11:03.271 --> 02:11:04.689
Come out.

1438
02:11:05.315 --> 02:11:07.275
Come out, wherever you are.

1439
02:11:14.866 --> 02:11:16.201
Come out.

1440
02:12:58.386 --> 02:12:59.387
Now!

1441
02:13:17.197 --> 02:13:20.074
-You didn't think about that, did you?
-They gotta breathe.

1442
02:13:51.439 --> 02:13:52.941
You got the grenades?

1443
02:13:54.067 --> 02:13:55.360
Right, sir.

1444
02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:57.612
We got enough to blow up the world.

1445
02:14:15.505 --> 02:14:16.756
What do we do about them?

1446
02:14:18.967 --> 02:14:21.177
Feed the French and kill the Germans.

1447
02:14:23.721 --> 02:14:26.391
-Franko, cover that corner.
-What happened?

1448
02:14:26.558 --> 02:14:30.436
They're in the bunker.
There's gotta be air vents. Take a look.

1449
02:14:30.645 --> 02:14:32.814
All right, bring your grenades!
Over here!

1450
02:14:32.981 --> 02:14:34.524
I'll take them.

1451
02:14:45.326 --> 02:14:46.744
Here they are.

1452
02:14:52.959 --> 02:14:54.502
Take it down there.

1453
02:14:56.379 --> 02:14:58.006
Get Vladek out here.

1454
02:15:01.009 --> 02:15:02.719
Where's that coming from?

1455
02:15:10.018 --> 02:15:11.477
Vladek, we need you.

1456
02:15:12.812 --> 02:15:14.480
Come on, come on.

1457
02:15:19.569 --> 02:15:21.904
Get over here and start a truck!

1458
02:15:40.381 --> 02:15:44.260
Wladislaw, Jefferson.
Get the lids off those other ventilators.

1459
02:15:49.474 --> 02:15:51.601
You know what you gotta do, so do it.

1460
02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:06.282
All right, you Frenchies, beat it.

1461
02:16:27.679 --> 02:16:29.764
No, it's all right. Go on.

1462
02:16:36.604 --> 02:16:38.564
Get up there and cover that bridge!

1463
02:16:41.109 --> 02:16:42.443
Move it!

1464
02:16:50.326 --> 02:16:51.619
Help Bowren!

1465
02:17:16.352 --> 02:17:17.812
There they are!

1466
02:17:37.665 --> 02:17:39.667
Hurry it up. Posey's got trouble!

1467
02:17:45.506 --> 02:17:47.884
Get one of those trucks started!

1468
02:17:57.685 --> 02:18:01.147
No, no, no. Leave the pins in.
The pins in,

1469
02:18:28.508 --> 02:18:30.718
Bowren, get some gasoline.

1470
02:18:31.594 --> 02:18:33.221
Some gasoline?

1471
02:18:33.721 --> 02:18:34.722
Are you sure?

1472
02:18:35.306 --> 02:18:37.892
You want to ask Pinkley and Vladek?
Get going!

1473
02:18:40.353 --> 02:18:41.479
Yes, sir.

1474
02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.890
Sawyer, Lever, cover that bridge!

1475
02:19:18.391 --> 02:19:20.893
Do you believe it?
They keep these locked.

1476
02:19:21.102 --> 02:19:22.603
Keep looking!

1477
02:19:30.486 --> 02:19:31.863
The other road!

1478
02:20:23.831 --> 02:20:26.250
Come on, baby.
Where are you, baby?

1479
02:20:44.226 --> 02:20:45.645
Let's go!

1480
02:20:50.608 --> 02:20:52.234
Move over.

1481
02:20:53.027 --> 02:20:54.487
Wladislaw...

1482
02:20:54.695 --> 02:20:56.822
...get Vladek out of there, huh?

1483
02:21:33.818 --> 02:21:35.194
Another flare!

1484
02:21:46.455 --> 02:21:47.832
Come on, you--

1485
02:21:50.543 --> 02:21:55.047
When I give the signal, set them off
and get the hell out of there.

1486
02:21:55.256 --> 02:21:57.091
We'll wait for you at the bridge.

1487
02:21:57.299 --> 02:21:58.676
-Right?
-Right.

1488
02:22:02.805 --> 02:22:03.931
Let's go!

1489
02:22:13.607 --> 02:22:16.110
Come on, let's go. Hurry up!

1490
02:22:40.134 --> 02:22:41.469
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1491
02:22:41.635 --> 02:22:43.846
Jefferson, set them off!

1492
02:22:44.221 --> 02:22:47.016
Get that thing out of here
or we'll all go up!

1493
02:23:12.708 --> 02:23:14.043
Let's go.

1494
02:23:19.256 --> 02:23:20.883
They're not gonna make it.

1495
02:23:22.259 --> 02:23:25.096
We'll get a boat
and get out at the other side.

1496
02:24:02.758 --> 02:24:04.802
All right, blow it!

1497
02:24:07.221 --> 02:24:10.558
Remember, Jefferson, 20 seconds!

1498
02:24:18.399 --> 02:24:20.109
-Faster, faster.
-Come on!

1499
02:24:20.401 --> 02:24:24.989
Jefferson faster.
Come on, Jefferson. Run!

1500
02:24:25.197 --> 02:24:26.282
-Go!
-Hurry up!

1501
02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:29.285
-Come on, move!
-Come on, come on.

1502
02:24:30.744 --> 02:24:33.372
-It's gonna blow!
-Come on!

1503
02:24:33.581 --> 02:24:35.249
Come on, Jefferson!

1504
02:25:30.804 --> 02:25:32.097
Come on, start.

1505
02:25:33.432 --> 02:25:36.518
It won't start.
The bastard won't start!

1506
02:25:50.783 --> 02:25:52.034
All right, get in.

1507
02:26:41.709 --> 02:26:44.253
Shift! Shift it, shift it!

1508
02:27:28.589 --> 02:27:29.965
We made it!

1509
02:27:30.174 --> 02:27:33.385
We made it. Those stupid bastards,
we made it!

1510
02:27:33.594 --> 02:27:34.845
Keep shooting!

1511
02:27:45.522 --> 02:27:46.774
Major!

1512
02:27:52.279 --> 02:27:55.157
Among the many reports
of the raid on the chateau...

1513
02:27:55.366 --> 02:27:58.577
...perhaps the most objective
is the one by General Worden...

1514
02:27:58.786 --> 02:27:59.995
...in which he states:

1515
02:28:00.204 --> 02:28:04.458
"We are recommending that members
of the group 'The Dirty Dozen'...

1516
02:28:04.625 --> 02:28:08.337
...who survived should have their
records amended to indicate...

1517
02:28:08.545 --> 02:28:11.965
...that they are being returned
to active duty at their former ranks.

1518
02:28:12.299 --> 02:28:16.595
And that the next of kin of those
who were killed be advised...

1519
02:28:16.804 --> 02:28:19.848
...that they lost their lives
in the line of duty.”

1520
02:28:20.182 --> 02:28:21.683
You did a fine job, major.

1521
