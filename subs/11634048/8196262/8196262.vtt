Williams: Midnight.

8
00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:53.546
We don't want to be involved.

9
00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:59.506
Madam, a woman was just killed.

10
00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:02.718
We're going to see this
investigation through

We actually didn't have

14

15

Carl: You laying
bricks out here, man.

19
00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:27.038
- You building a house?
- It was the wind.

20
00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.414
The wind messed up
your layups, too?

21
00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:29.916
- Heh.
- Ha ha ha!

22
00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:32.711

believe it's been 5 years.

25

So where you taking
here for your big 5?

26

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:44.934
- OK. Yes.
- So I was thinking maybe

29
00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:47.145
a 5-star restaurant
like Mr. Chow's,

30
00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:48.604
you know what I'm saying?

31
00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:50.149
Come on, bro.

32
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.984
It's your big 5.

33
00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.821
Listen. Me and Vivian, we
went to Italy last year.

34
00:01:54.822 --> 00:01:56.865
It was amazing!

35
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.993
I don't like to
travel. You know that.

36

Mission still messing with you?

37
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:08.420
Those trips never
happened, Carl, right?

38

Carl: Past in the past.

39

never left the country before.

40
00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:16.804
Carl: What? Are you serious?

41
00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.807
Look. I got one for you.

42
00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:20.392
Oh! Here we go!

43
00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:22.644
If you make it...

44
00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:25.106
you can take Zena to
whatever Chinese restaurant

45
00:02:25.107 --> 00:02:26.566
you want to take her to...

46
00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:28.610
Jimmy Choo's, Gyu-Kaku...

47

- Mr. Chow's, man!
- Mr. Chow's. Mr. Chow's.

48
00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:32.364
- Don't disrespect Mr. Chow, OK?
- Oh, all right, all right.

49
00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.533
All right. Mr. Chow's,

50
00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:37.412
but if you miss it,

51
00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:39.831
you got to take her
somewhere exotic.

52
00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:41.583
Sounds expensive. You paying?

53
00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:43.419
Carl: Come on, bro. There's
a lot of good deals.

54
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.505
You could take her to Thailand,

55
00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:48.675
Bali, the Philippines.

56

- You can shoot from anywhere

59
00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.566
because you been bricking,
so it doesn't matter.

Can't tell by the look of it.

180
00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:22.093
I guess we seat ourselves.

181
00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:29.726
- Right there.
- I think that's reserved.

182
00:09:29.727 --> 00:09:32.271
How did they know
we were coming?

183
00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:34.900
Best seat in the house.

184
00:09:40.323 --> 00:09:41.532
Look at that view.

185
00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:44.994
- Hello.
- Hi, sir. Hi, ma'am.

186
00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:48.039
I'm so sorry, but
table is reserved.

187
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.708
Zena: Oh. Floyd:
Oh. We figured

188
00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:51.168
that since there was
basically no one here

189
00:09:51.169 --> 00:09:52.628
that we could sit wherever.

190
00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:53.962
Waitress: Sorry.
You can't sit here.

191
00:09:53.963 --> 00:09:55.715
Any other table is fine.

192
00:09:55.716 --> 00:09:57.217
I'm just as confused as to why.

193
00:09:57.218 --> 00:09:59.177
This is for a VIP, sir.

194
00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:01.305
- Who is this VIP?
- Floyd, let's just move,

195
00:10:01.306 --> 00:10:03.183
Man: I would be this VIP.

196
00:10:05.685 --> 00:10:07.145
- Hello.
- So sorry, sir.

197
00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:08.396
I tired to tell them.

198
00:10:08.397 --> 00:10:09.606
It's all right, it's all right.

199
00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:12.108
It's not a big deal.

200
00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:14.070
Floyd: Hey, man. My bad.
We can... we can move.

201
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.696
Man: No, no, no, no. Don't.
Please, please, please.

202
00:10:15.697 --> 00:10:17.365
Sit, sit. As long
as you don't mind us

203
00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:18.617
sitting with you.

204
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.870
- It's your table.
- Heh heh.

205
00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:26.918
Start them out.

206
00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.169
Waitress: Can I get
something for you to drink?

207
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.340
Man: Let me guess... Mai Tai.

208
00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:33.133
- How'd you know?
- Heh!

209
00:10:33.134 --> 00:10:36.388
Popular island drink, but
if I might be so bold,

210
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:39.140
the Mestizo are to die for here.

211
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:42.645
Oh. Well, done.
I'll have a Mestizo.

212
00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:44.438
Oh. I'll have a
shot of Hennessey.

213
00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:46.524
Waitress: I'm sorry, sir,
but don't have Hennessey.

214
00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:49.820
Man: Ha ha ha! Well,
that settles it then.

215
00:10:49.821 --> 00:10:51.488
4 Mestizos, please,
and make sure

216
00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:53.073
this goes on my tab.

217
00:10:53.074 --> 00:10:54.742
Off you go.

218
00:10:54.743 --> 00:10:56.995
Thank you.

219
00:10:56.996 --> 00:10:59.163
Man: So what's the story?

220
00:10:59.164 --> 00:11:01.125
Globetrotters I reckon.

221
00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:04.169
Actually, this is my first
time out the country.

222
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.046
Are you serious?

223
00:11:06.047 --> 00:11:08.216
Well, welcome to Cebu.

224
00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:09.968
Where are you guys from?

225
00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:12.972
- Los Angeles.
- Ah. L.A.

226
00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:15.349
Not really a fan to
tell you the truth.

227
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.101
All that traffic.

228
00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:18.896
Venice Beach. My God.

229
00:11:18.897 --> 00:11:20.856
I've never seen so many
drug dealers in one place.

230
00:11:20.857 --> 00:11:22.608
Floyd: Nobody from L.A.
goes to Venice Beach.

231
00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:24.319
Man: And if you
give up your car,

232
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.154
you'll never be stuck in
the traffic. Ha ha ha!

233
00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:28.323
Sorry. Uh, what's your name?

234
00:11:28.324 --> 00:11:29.616
I'm sorry. I've been so rude.

235
00:11:29.617 --> 00:11:30.785
I'm Kane.

236
00:11:34.581 --> 00:11:36.583
Floyd.

237
00:11:36.584 --> 00:11:38.168
This is my wife Zena.

238
00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:41.046
Kane: Zena.

239
00:11:41.047 --> 00:11:43.424
What a beautiful name?

240
00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:45.092
Ha ha ha!

241
00:11:45.093 --> 00:11:48.388
And I'm good at this. Wait.

242
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:50.307
Honeymoon.

243
00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:51.850
- Anniversary.
- Aw!

244
00:11:51.851 --> 00:11:54.145
I was close, though. So close.

245
00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:56.814
Congratulations are
still in order, though.

246
00:11:56.815 --> 00:11:58.358
Thanks.

247
00:11:58.359 --> 00:11:59.609
And you are?

248
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.153
Kane: Oh, this is Nihla.

249
00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:02.821
She doesn't speak
English, I'm afraid,

250
00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.615
so you don't have to
pretend to be polite,

251
00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:07.869
but, my God, she's
pretty to look at.

252
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.205
Hi, Nihla. Nice to meet you.

253
00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:12.124
Kane: Heh heh heh.

254
00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:13.584
So you're a regular here?

255
00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:15.419
Kane: Same time every day.

256
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.964
This place has the best
pasta on the whole island.

257
00:12:17.965 --> 00:12:20.092
Tell me have you ever had
that street food out there,

258
00:12:20.093 --> 00:12:21.551
that balut?

259
00:12:21.552 --> 00:12:23.553
Do yourself a favor. Don't.

260
00:12:23.554 --> 00:12:25.056
It's disgusting.

261
00:12:25.057 --> 00:12:26.891
Well, apart from that, though,

262
00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:29.352
you guys picked a beautiful
spot for your anniversary.

263
00:12:29.353 --> 00:12:31.105
Floyd: We plan to
see the whole city.

264
00:12:31.106 --> 00:12:32.940
Well, of course you are
because you just happen

265
00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:34.942
to be so lucky as to run
into the best tour guide

266
00:12:34.943 --> 00:12:36.444
on the island.

267
00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:37.904
You are not short
of confidence, huh?

268
00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:39.614
Kane: I don't need to be.

269
00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:41.491
We picked up this tourist guide.

270
00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:43.786
It's a map from the, uh, hotel.

271
00:12:43.787 --> 00:12:45.247
Kane: Ooh. Let me see.

272
00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:49.126
Ha ha ha!

273
00:12:49.127 --> 00:12:51.753
You look like a tourist,
Floyd. You want to avoid that.

274
00:12:51.754 --> 00:12:55.174
You'll get charged 3 times
as much for everything.

275
00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:57.594
You know what you guys need?

276
00:12:57.595 --> 00:13:00.306
A trip on a boat, my boat.

277
00:13:00.307 --> 00:13:01.724
Zena: You have a boat?

278
00:13:01.725 --> 00:13:03.183
Kane: I sure do.
I have several.

279
00:13:03.184 --> 00:13:05.436
My baby, my real
baby is my yacht,

280
00:13:05.437 --> 00:13:08.607
but she's on the southside
of the island in Moalboal,

281
00:13:08.608 --> 00:13:10.275
but I happen to
have a bangka boat

282
00:13:10.276 --> 00:13:11.860
right here at the marina.

283
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:13.321
It's yours.

284
00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:14.655
Floyd: Thanks for
the offer, man,

285
00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:16.240
but we actually have plans.

286
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.950
We do?

287
00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:20.662
You wanted to see the
Lapulapu statute, right?

288
00:13:20.663 --> 00:13:22.289
Oh, we can do that anytime.

289
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.832
Kane: Right? Zena: Yeah.

290
00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:25.710
Kane: Come on,
Floyd. Live a little.

291
00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:27.295
You're on your anniversary.

292
00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:29.839
What's... what's the
worst that could happen?

293
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.133
Come on, Floyd.

294
00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:32.968
Kane: Oh, I see it.

295
00:13:32.969 --> 00:13:34.803
He wants to say yes.

296
00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:36.932
He wants to say it. I can
see it your eyes, Floyd!

297
00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:38.475
You want to say it.
Zena, make him say it.

298
00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:40.310
Zena: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

299
00:13:40.311 --> 00:13:41.645
Kane: Yes, yes,
yes, yes! Say it.

300
00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:43.814
Floyd: Yes! Zena: Yeah!

301
00:13:43.815 --> 00:13:47.818
Kane: Well, I'm gonna propose
a toast to new friends.

302
00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:49.363
Floyd: To new friends.

303
00:13:49.364 --> 00:13:51.115
Cheers!

304
00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:06.299
Is this what you do every day?

305
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.221
Kane: Nope. Twice
a day. Ha ha ha!

306
00:14:11.222 --> 00:14:13.557
I love the water, Floyd.

307
00:14:13.558 --> 00:14:15.059
Fucking can't get enough of it.

308
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.102
It's part of the
reason I came here.

309
00:14:16.103 --> 00:14:17.271
Floyd: Hmm.

310
00:14:19.148 --> 00:14:21.900
I could get used to this.

311
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:23.944
You wouldn't.

312
00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:25.863
That's the great
thing about it, Floyd.

313
00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.783
It's fucking amazing every day.

314
00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.202
I love it.

315
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.871
How long have you lived here?

316
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:36.209
I'm on a kind of, uh,
extended vacation.

317
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.586
You know? Stay here
as long as I want,

318
00:14:38.587 --> 00:14:42.133
as long as I like
it, until I don't.

319
00:14:42.134 --> 00:14:44.928
I don't blame you. Hmm.

320
00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:51.476
Kane: That Zena there,
she's a beauty, Floyd.

321
00:14:51.477 --> 00:14:54.314
Tough as nails,
as well, I'll bet.

322
00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:56.065
Tougher.

323
00:14:56.066 --> 00:14:57.900
Heh heh heh.

324
00:14:57.901 --> 00:15:00.697
It takes a strong man to
keep a woman like that happy.

325
00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:05.701
Heh heh heh. I'm just
messing with you.

326
00:15:05.702 --> 00:15:07.330
Ha ha ha!

327
00:15:09.332 --> 00:15:10.749
Floyd: What about Nihla?

328
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.460
How did you two meet,

329
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:14.795
being that she
doesn't speak English.

330
00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:16.964
Right. Well, I picked
up some Cebuano

331
00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:18.425
from my time on the island.

332
00:15:18.426 --> 00:15:19.926
You pick up phrases
here or there.

333
00:15:19.927 --> 00:15:21.387
It's enough.

334
00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:26.726
Floyd: You must have
done well for yourself,

335
00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:28.728
being able to
afford all of this.

336
00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:30.814
Yeah, I did all right.

337
00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:32.524
What exactly do you do?

338
00:15:32.525 --> 00:15:35.861
Ha ha! Floyd, let's not
ruin a beautiful day

339
00:15:35.862 --> 00:15:38.698
by talking about boring work.

340
00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:42.203
Besides, it's
complicated, you know?

341
00:15:42.204 --> 00:15:44.705
Zena: Hey, babe.
Check out the island.

342
00:15:44.706 --> 00:15:46.540
It's beautiful.

343
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:48.501
Kane: Oh, yeah. Whoa, whoa.
This is where we stop!

344
00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.674
Why here?

345
00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:55.468
- See the island ahead of us?
- Yeah.

346
00:15:55.469 --> 00:15:57.762
It's actually got a
military base on it.

347
00:15:57.763 --> 00:16:01.642
A couple hundred more feet,
and we'd be in their waters.

348
00:16:01.643 --> 00:16:03.352
Don't think anyone wants
to spend the afternoon

349
00:16:03.353 --> 00:16:06.064
staring down the
barrel of an AR-15.

350
00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.066
Yeah. Let's just stop here.

351
00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.776
Good idea.

352
00:16:09.777 --> 00:16:11.152
Floyd, voice-over: I'm

They're always happy to listen.

527
00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:56.042
Zena: And I bet if
they could talk back

528
00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:57.377
they'd tell you to leave
them the hell alone.

529
00:22:57.378 --> 00:22:58.920
Kane: What's the matter?

530
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:00.547
You not a nature
person or something?

531
00:23:00.548 --> 00:23:02.466
Eh, you know what?
I'm just not too keen

532
00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:04.051
on buddying up with anything
that can swallow me whole.

533
00:23:04.052 --> 00:23:05.386
Kane: Ha ha ha!

534
00:23:05.387 --> 00:23:06.931
Fair enough.

535
00:23:08.557 --> 00:23:10.934
Well, how about we
return the favor?

536
00:23:10.935 --> 00:23:14.480
- Seafood anyone?
- I'm down.

537
00:23:14.481 --> 00:23:16.399
Mackeehan: ♪ Don't want to
stop, don't want to stop ♪

538
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.860
♪ Till the evening's done ♪

539
00:23:18.861 --> 00:23:20.779
♪ Till the evening's done ♪

540
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.616
Floyd: OK, OK. I
get it. I'm sold.

541
00:23:23.617 --> 00:23:25.284
I understand why you
don't want to leave.

542
00:23:25.285 --> 00:23:26.953
Kane: Heh heh heh.

543
00:23:26.954 --> 00:23:28.746
I told you this place
is paradise, right?

544
00:23:28.747 --> 00:23:30.916
Look at it. Look
at me sat here like

545
00:23:30.917 --> 00:23:33.043
the king of the
hill. Heh heh heh.

546
00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:35.462
I get to stroke my dick
whatever time I want.

547
00:23:35.463 --> 00:23:37.549
To each his own.

548
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.259
Kane: What did you say you
did for a living, Floyd?

549
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.720
Construction.

550
00:23:42.639 --> 00:23:45.558
When it's slow, I help my
friend out at his car shop.

551
00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:49.104
Hmm. So a builder
and a mechanic.

552
00:23:49.105 --> 00:23:51.148
I figure there's more to you,

553
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:52.649
but you're a modest
fella, so you're not

554
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.652
gonna say, are you,
Floyd? Ha ha ha!

555
00:23:54.653 --> 00:23:56.154
Floyd: Well, I don't
have the padded accounts

556
00:23:56.155 --> 00:23:58.448
like you do, but
we do all right.

557
00:23:58.449 --> 00:24:00.325
What are you
talking about, mate?

558
00:24:00.326 --> 00:24:02.786
A little goes a long way
here, like a very long way.

559
00:24:02.787 --> 00:24:04.913
You and Zena move here, you
could live like royalty,

560
00:24:04.914 --> 00:24:06.207
you know that?

561
00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:07.625
Floyd: Well, tell me, Kane,

562
00:24:07.626 --> 00:24:09.961
how do you make your money?

563
00:24:09.962 --> 00:24:11.630
I could...

564
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:13.341
but then I'd have to kill you.

565
00:24:15.761 --> 00:24:17.637
Ha ha ha!

566
00:24:17.638 --> 00:24:19.222
Heh heh heh.

567
00:24:19.223 --> 00:24:20.807
Zena: What are you
guys talking about?

568
00:24:20.808 --> 00:24:22.851
Oh, hey. Uh, Kane
was just telling me

569
00:24:22.852 --> 00:24:24.395
how lucky I was to
have you as my wife.

570
00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:26.356
Zena: Mmm. Smart man.

571
00:24:30.195 --> 00:24:31.779
I have an idea.

572
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.406
I think we should
hit the city tonight.

573
00:24:34.407 --> 00:24:35.825
Floyd: No. Zena: No, no.

574
00:24:35.826 --> 00:24:37.410
I'm way too tired for that.

575
00:24:37.411 --> 00:24:39.204
This jetlag is
catching up with me,

576
00:24:39.205 --> 00:24:40.747
and I... I need to
get my 10 hours.

577
00:24:40.748 --> 00:24:42.500
Kane: I don't think
I sold this right.

578
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:45.086
Guys, you're here probably
for another week, right?

579
00:24:45.087 --> 00:24:47.506
This is Friday
night in Cebu City.

580
00:24:47.507 --> 00:24:49.132
I guarantee you there's
nothing else like it

581
00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:50.634
in the whole world.

582
00:24:50.635 --> 00:24:52.302
You need to check it out.

583
00:24:52.303 --> 00:24:54.722
Come on. YOLO. You
only live once, right?

584
00:24:54.723 --> 00:24:57.683
The kids say that,
right? Am I right?

585
00:24:57.684 --> 00:24:59.478
Floyd: No. No, no. We're done.

586
00:24:59.479 --> 00:25:00.979
Kane: Ahh. Floyd: No. Listen.

587
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.856
We appreciate the
hospitality, the boat.

588
00:25:02.857 --> 00:25:04.817
Everything has been amazing.

589
00:25:04.818 --> 00:25:06.653
We're just too tired.

590
00:25:06.654 --> 00:25:08.906
Zena, I can't twist your arm?

591
00:25:12.452 --> 00:25:16.956
Shoot. Heh heh. I had to try.

592
00:25:16.957 --> 00:25:19.251
And you guys got to forgive me.

593
00:25:19.252 --> 00:25:21.670
I sit here, and I'm... happy,

594
00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:23.338
I'm having my cigar,

595
00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:26.467
but Nihla doesn't
speak any English,

596
00:25:26.468 --> 00:25:28.511
and then I finally
find two people

597
00:25:28.512 --> 00:25:30.180
who not only speak the language

598
00:25:30.181 --> 00:25:31.932
but I can actually
shoot the shit with?

599
00:25:31.933 --> 00:25:33.892
I get a little excited,
I get carried away,

600
00:25:33.893 --> 00:25:36.062
and I want to soak you
up for as long as I can,

601
00:25:36.063 --> 00:25:40.233
and normally it's about
this time of night I realize

602
00:25:40.234 --> 00:25:44.447
I hadn't spoken to
anybody all day.

603
00:25:44.448 --> 00:25:46.908
Like, an entire day without
talking to anybody...

604
00:25:50.204 --> 00:25:51.872
but I get it. I get it.

605
00:25:51.873 --> 00:25:53.416
You're on your honeymoon...

606
00:25:53.417 --> 00:25:55.126
Your... your anniversary,
I mean, you know?

607
00:25:55.127 --> 00:25:57.295
You need to reconnect,
rekindle the romance.

608
00:25:57.296 --> 00:25:59.088
You're young. Heh heh.

609
00:25:59.089 --> 00:26:02.259
I get it. Don't you
worry about Kane.

610
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.095
Kane's OK. Look at him.
He's living his best life.

611
00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:07.265
Ha ha ha!

612
00:26:07.266 --> 00:26:09.685
Ain't nobody got to
worry about Kane.

613
00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:15.483
Floyd, you should go.

614
00:26:15.484 --> 00:26:18.028
- No.
- Make it a fellas' night.

615
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:21.156
- Uh. Are you sure?
- Don't worry about me

616
00:26:21.157 --> 00:26:22.699
I will be fine.

617
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.035
Just take me to the hotel,

618
00:26:24.036 --> 00:26:25.745
and I'll rest up for tomorrow.

619
00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:27.622
Wait.

620
00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:30.209
Is this... is this happening?

621
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.877
Floyd?

622
00:26:31.878 --> 00:26:33.087
OK.

623
00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:35.089
- Yes!
- One drink.

624
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.883
One quiet drink.

625
00:26:36.884 --> 00:26:38.885
- Then I'm done.
- You have my word.

626
00:26:38.886 --> 00:26:41.472
Floyd: I'll take Zena
back, and I'll freshen up.

627
00:26:41.473 --> 00:26:43.974
Zena: And I'll gas
up the motorbikes.

628
00:26:43.975 --> 00:26:45.518
Motorbikes?

629
00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:47.729
Floyd, we're gonna
have some fun tonight

630
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.191
[Thunder]

631
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:04.248
Floyd, voice-over: I don't
know why I let him talk me

632
00:27:04.249 --> 00:27:06.292
into going out.

633
00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:08.336
I should have taken
the storm as a sign

634
00:27:08.337 --> 00:27:10.088
and stayed my ass at the hotel.

635
00:27:10.089 --> 00:27:11.465
Kane: Floyd, this
is a quiet drink.

636
00:27:11.466 --> 00:27:12.591
Floyd, voice-over:
The bikini bar's

637
00:27:12.592 --> 00:27:13.718
where everything changed.

638
00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:15.177
Far from a quiet drink.

639
00:27:15.178 --> 00:27:17.221
[Dance music playing]

640
00:27:17.222 --> 00:27:18.724
Kane: Ha ha ha!

641
00:27:18.725 --> 00:27:21.184
Ladies, go easy on him.

642
00:27:21.185 --> 00:27:23.980
I've only got him on
loan for the night.

643
00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:25.648
What are we drinking, Floyd?

644
00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:26.899
Floyd: Feeling adventurous.

645
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.609
I'll try your, uh, Mestizo.

646
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.571
Kane: No, no, no. Here, boy,

647
00:27:30.572 --> 00:27:32.072
here we drink champagne.

648
00:27:32.073 --> 00:27:33.699
Oh. Champagne it is.

649
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.744
Kane: Champagne,
sweetheart, on my account.

650
00:27:35.745 --> 00:27:37.162
Dancer: Want a dance?

651
00:27:37.163 --> 00:27:38.580
No. I'm... I'm good.

652
00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:39.873
Dancer: You don't
think I'm sexy?

653
00:27:39.874 --> 00:27:41.082
Floyd: No. You're beautiful.

654
00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:42.460
I'm here with my friend.

655
00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:43.919
Give us a minute.

656
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.713
He's just easing
into it, all right?

657
00:27:45.714 --> 00:27:49.509
Go on. Off you go,
sweetheart. Go on. Off you go.

658
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.679
- You're a wild boy.
- Ha ha ha!

659
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.683
Hey. Yeah, yeah.

660
00:27:55.684 --> 00:27:58.770
Everything's OK.

661
00:27:58.771 --> 00:28:00.273
Hey, Jinx!

662
00:28:03.026 --> 00:28:06.446
Make sure that gets to
the people that need it.

663
00:28:06.447 --> 00:28:08.281
Heh heh heh.

664
00:28:08.282 --> 00:28:11.034
- Who was that?
- Oh, he runs the place,

665
00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:13.287
but he comes over to the
house to play a bit of poker.

666
00:28:13.288 --> 00:28:14.997
I lost, so I owe him some money.

667
00:28:14.998 --> 00:28:17.959
- Ah.
- Ha ha ha!

668
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.961
What's up with you and security?

669
00:28:19.962 --> 00:28:22.506
You can never be
too careful, Floyd.

670
00:28:22.507 --> 00:28:24.092
No. I'm just trying to make
sure nobody's running up in here

671
00:28:24.093 --> 00:28:25.676
looking for you,

672
00:28:25.677 --> 00:28:27.720
and by you, I mean
me. Kane: Ha ha ha!

673
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:29.013
Come on. Surely a guy
with a gun doesn't

674
00:28:29.014 --> 00:28:31.850
scare you people.

675
00:28:31.851 --> 00:28:34.603
"You people"?

676
00:28:34.604 --> 00:28:37.065
Americans.

677
00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:39.943
Ha! Relax, Floyd. Please.

678
00:28:39.944 --> 00:28:41.278
You're having a drink
with one of the most

679
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.030
respected men on the island,

680
00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:44.407
and I'm trying to stay
humble when I do that,

681
00:28:44.408 --> 00:28:45.908
but I can't! I am!

682
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:48.328
They fucking love me here!

683
00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:50.415
You put this on my tab, OK?

684
00:28:53.877 --> 00:28:55.962
Let's unwrap her.

685
00:28:55.963 --> 00:28:57.672
Ahh.

686
00:28:57.673 --> 00:29:02.010
- Ohh!
- Whoa! Ha ha ha!

687
00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:04.763
- The good kind.
- The best.

688
00:29:04.764 --> 00:29:06.767
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers.

689
00:29:09.186 --> 00:29:11.104
Floyd: So why us? I
mean, the hospitality,

690
00:29:11.105 --> 00:29:13.566
you know, showing us around.

691
00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:16.318
Because we're friends, right?

692
00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:17.863
Heh heh heh!

693
00:29:17.864 --> 00:29:19.322
Floyd, I remember
what it's like landing

694
00:29:19.323 --> 00:29:20.532
on the island for
the first time.

695
00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:21.992
It's electrifying,

696
00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.786
but you need to know
the right people,

697
00:29:23.787 --> 00:29:25.872
somebody to show you
around all the best places.

698
00:29:25.873 --> 00:29:27.999
That's me. I'm
paying it forward

699
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.501
because you were the

to steal my fucking table!

701
00:29:31.963 --> 00:29:33.589
I like that.

702
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.508
It reminds me of me
as a young man...

703
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:38.428
Ballsy, you know?

704
00:29:38.429 --> 00:29:40.096
You're gonna be all right here.

705
00:29:40.097 --> 00:29:41.515
In fact, I'm gonna
show you a great time.

706

sweet ass down here!

Floyd: Oh, no, no.
Kane: Yeah, yeah.

709
00:29:49.066 --> 00:29:51.359
I told you I was gonna
show you a good time,

710
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.778
and I am.

711
00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:54.155
Flower, sweetheart,

712
00:29:54.156 --> 00:29:55.698
give my buddy Floyd a dance.

713
00:29:55.699 --> 00:29:57.408
Hey. Do whatever he
wants, all right?

714
00:29:57.409 --> 00:30:00.621
Show him a good time.
That's a good girl.

715
00:30:00.622 --> 00:30:03.415
Go on, Floyd. Relax.
You're on holiday.

716
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:05.125
Look. She's not gonna bite you.

717
00:30:05.126 --> 00:30:07.128
I didn't pay her
enough money bite you.

718
00:30:07.129 --> 00:30:11.425
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

721
00:30:35.955 --> 00:30:37.664
Y-you don't have to dance.

722
00:30:37.665 --> 00:30:40.166
I'll dance for you,
sir, as Mr. Kane said.

723
00:30:40.167 --> 00:30:42.002
How do you know his name?

724
00:30:42.003 --> 00:30:44.089
Everyone knows his name. Heh.

725
00:30:46.883 --> 00:30:51.596
Who is he really?

726
00:30:51.597 --> 00:30:53.474
I can't say any more.

727
00:30:53.475 --> 00:30:55.768
Just... just relax.

728
00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:58.896
You don't have to
worry about that. Heh.

729
00:30:58.897 --> 00:31:01.651
Floyd: Look. I...
I won't tell him.

730
00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:19.212
I'm afraid Mr. Kane is
gonna get angry at me.

731
00:31:19.213 --> 00:31:21.048
Why are you so scared of him?

732
00:31:29.684 --> 00:31:33.730
Mr. Kane... he used to
come here many, many times.

733
00:31:35.566 --> 00:31:38.109
That's where he met
Nihla, my cousin.

734
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.986
Nihla's your cousin?

735
00:31:39.987 --> 00:31:41.572
She used to dance here?

736
00:31:41.573 --> 00:31:44.241
Yes. A long time ago.

737
00:31:44.242 --> 00:31:46.368
Top dancer, too.

738
00:31:46.369 --> 00:31:48.371
He keeps Nihla away
from her family,

739
00:31:48.372 --> 00:31:50.791
and every time she
tries to leave,

740
00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:55.046
he threatens to kill her.

741
00:31:55.047 --> 00:31:57.965
She's very afraid of him.

742
00:31:57.966 --> 00:32:01.011
That's why she pretends
to not understand English.

743
00:32:01.012 --> 00:32:03.514
She speaks English?

744
00:32:03.515 --> 00:32:09.104
Yes. She used to teach me.

745
00:32:09.105 --> 00:32:14.735
Sir, Nihla knows the
truth about Mr. Kane.

746
00:32:14.736 --> 00:32:17.615
Just ask her yourself.
I'm not lying.

747
00:32:25.874 --> 00:32:28.042
Oh, no. That's
too much. It's OK.

748
00:32:28.043 --> 00:32:33.549
No. Take it. Help your family.

Oh, shit! I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

Am I gonna get you in trouble?

757

No, no, no. I'll be all right.

- Yeah.

That stripper... I don't know
what she said to you, man.

I don't mean to get awkward,

766

but these girls, you know,

767
00:33:40.002 --> 00:33:42.588
they don't know what the fuck
they're talking about sometimes.

768
00:33:42.589 --> 00:33:45.925
They're coked up half the
time they're here at work.

769
00:33:45.926 --> 00:33:47.594
Always. It's just
kind of their job,

770
00:33:47.595 --> 00:33:49.387
but it does mean that
they talk a lot of shit.

771
00:33:49.388 --> 00:33:51.097
Floyd: Mmm. No, no, no.
She was just giving me

772

some recommendations on
some local street food.

- Yeah.

the street food?

- It was shit.
- Shit!

- Yes.
- That's right, mate.

you take a cab home?

1050
00:47:26.049 --> 00:47:28.927
didn't understand each other.

1051
00:47:28.928 --> 00:47:31.139
Please. I really have to go.

1052
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:44.737
Mmm. All cleaned up?

1053
00:47:44.738 --> 00:47:47.449
Hey, Floyd. You think we can
head back to the room for a bit?

1054
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.950
I'm not feeling well.

1055
00:47:48.951 --> 00:47:50.994
Aw, but you just got here.

1056
00:47:50.995 --> 00:47:52.538
Let me at least buy you a drink.

1057
00:47:52.539 --> 00:47:56.167
Floyd: No. No more
Mestizos for us,

1058
00:47:56.168 --> 00:47:58.169

Kane: Anytime, Floyd.

1060
00:47:59.672 --> 00:48:02.508
Floyd, be careful out there.

1061
00:48:06.263 --> 00:48:09.891
Because this place
is paradise...

1062
00:48:09.892 --> 00:48:11.728
until it's not.

1063
00:48:27.788 --> 00:48:29.331
Floyd: 15 minutes, please.

1064

dog eating contest

1075

- Is that him?

1082
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.332

1086
00:49:50.968 --> 00:49:53.054
We have to do it, Floyd,

1087
00:49:53.055 --> 00:49:54.555
not only because of the money,

1088
00:49:54.556 --> 00:49:56.140
but it's the right thing to do.

1089
00:49:56.141 --> 00:49:57.391
I don't know, Zena.

1090
00:49:57.392 --> 00:49:58.935
This is getting out of hand.

1091

You wanted to help Nihla.

1092
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:02.689
This is the only
way we can do it.

1093
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.818
We can't trust the police here.

1094
00:50:05.819 --> 00:50:08.071
Well, there's a
e-mail on the screen.

1095
00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:11.200
We can send a message
to the British MI6,

1096
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:13.161
and our work is done.

head to the embassy.

I don't know what you want,

1229
00:58:40.086 --> 00:58:41.628

I'm a gentleman.

I'm not gonna hurt Zena.

1233
00:58:47.428 --> 00:58:50.180
I mean, I do have to
fucking slit her throat

1234
00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:52.141
but only after I
get the information

1235
00:58:52.142 --> 00:58:55.352
on exactly who you two have
been talking to about me.

1236

about you, man.

time has been and gone,

1240

I did for you.

1241

Heh. We were friends,
Floyd, and you turned on me.

1243
00:59:14.667 --> 00:59:18.046

liked you both.

away with this, man.

Floyd... you know
who I really am,

1248
00:59:28.976 --> 00:59:32.438

of duty in Iraq.

your fucking pay

him in like a fish.

to leave this island.

for the both of us.

Your dangerously violent

1580
01:25:24.457 --> 01:25:26.835
almost impossible
for me to defend you.

Zena: Did they tell you
Kane and his dirty-ass cops

1582
01:25:28.379 --> 01:25:29.546
tried to kill us?

1584
01:25:31.382 --> 01:25:33.175

be a complete investigation

1585
01:25:33.176 --> 01:25:35.011

but because you're Americans,
I felt I needed to step in.

1593
01:25:54.409 --> 01:25:57.412
Seems Mr. Kane was
involved in a series

1594
01:25:57.413 --> 01:25:59.956
of bank robberies in London,

1595
01:25:59.957 --> 01:26:03.127

responsible for drug trafficking

1596
