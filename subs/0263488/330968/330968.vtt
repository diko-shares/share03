01:02:09.461 --> 01:02:10.795
Mom!

681
01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:18.261
I understand that, Mother. I'm just
trying to tell you where we are.

682
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:21.973
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both okay.

(SIGHS)

684
01:02:24.517 --> 01:02:28.812
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station,
about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.

685
01:02:30.148 --> 01:02:32.483
Because we'll be home
before you could get here.

686
01:02:34.152 --> 01:02:37.989
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.

687
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:41.201
Mom, just let us get home, okay?

688
01:02:42.118 --> 01:02:44.620
We don't wanna be out here
any more than you do.

689
01:02:44.996 --> 01:02:46.205
Me, too.

690
01:02:47.499 --> 01:02:49.751
I'll talk to you in a few hours.

691

692
01:02:56.508 --> 01:02:58.051
- Thought I wrecked the car?
- Mm-hmm.

693
01:02:58.551 --> 01:02:59.969
DARRY: She's trailer trash.

694
01:03:00.136 --> 01:03:01.762
- TRISHA: Pig fucker.
- Booger eater.

695
01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:02.931
Trisha?

696
01:03:05.684 --> 01:03:09.145
- Trisha and Darry, right?
- Jez, what are you doing here?

697
01:03:09.312 --> 01:03:11.856
Excuse me, Jezelle?

698
01:03:12.649 --> 01:03:13.775
Darry.

699
01:03:14.359 --> 01:03:16.361
Darry Jenner.

700
01:03:16.528 --> 01:03:20.073
- Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
- Come on. They've been through a lot.

701
01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.574
- Trisha?
- Goddamnit, Jez.

702
01:03:21.741 --> 01:03:25.035
I really need to talk to you,
if you could just spare me a minute.

703
01:03:25.203 --> 01:03:27.413
Jezelle likes to think she's
the resident psychic here.

704
01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.206
- She helped us on a missing persons...

705
01:03:29.374 --> 01:03:31.667
Do you think I could just
talk to these kids by myself?

706
01:03:31.835 --> 01:03:34.504
You go home, turn off that
police scanner, and go to bed.

707
01:03:34.671 --> 01:03:37.215
You got missing persons
and a fire in the next county.

708
01:03:37.382 --> 01:03:38.758
Go do something useful.

709
01:03:38.925 --> 01:03:41.636
- I mean it, now, leave them alone.
- (RINGING CONTINUES)

710

You don't have to believe I'm psychic.

711

You don't have to believe a word I say.

712
01:03:47.058 --> 01:03:49.477
But I've come a very long way to see you.

713
01:03:49.644 --> 01:03:53.814
You know, I'm not sure we should be
talking to anybody right now.

714
01:03:53.982 --> 01:03:54.941
Let's go.

715
01:03:55.108 --> 01:03:57.318
You found all those bodies...

716
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:59.945
down in that cellar.

717
01:04:01.573 --> 01:04:02.907
I saw them, too.

718
01:04:05.243 --> 01:04:06.244
How?

719
01:04:07.078 --> 01:04:08.454
Dreamed it.

720
01:04:09.247 --> 01:04:11.499
I dream a lot of things.

721
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.585
You see the cats yet?

722
01:04:16.796 --> 01:04:19.381
I saw you with all those cats, too.

723
01:04:20.216 --> 01:04:23.886
The diner. That was you. You called us.

724
01:04:25.013 --> 01:04:27.181
Will you excuse me for a second?

725
01:04:27.932 --> 01:04:31.518
- Darry, I need to talk...
- I need you to listen and not talk, okay?

726
01:04:31.895 --> 01:04:35.857
Truth be, I'd be lying if I said I knew
that telling you this would do any good.

727
01:04:36.608 --> 01:04:39.569
Any good? What does that mean?

728
01:04:40.362 --> 01:04:42.447
Every 23rd spring...

729
01:04:43.615 --> 01:04:45.950
for 23 days...

730
01:04:47.327 --> 01:04:50.788
it gets to... eat.

731
01:04:55.627 --> 01:04:56.794
Eat?

732
01:04:56.961 --> 01:05:00.047
You know what it eats,
and don't you make me tell you.

733
01:05:01.216 --> 01:05:04.385
You think I like having this in my head?

734
01:05:04.552 --> 01:05:05.970
Well, I don't.

735
01:05:06.137 --> 01:05:09.598
I don't like knowing this,
and not knowing why I do.

736
01:05:09.766 --> 01:05:11.642
You said it eats?

737
01:05:13.812 --> 01:05:16.689
Only certain things...

738
01:05:18.691 --> 01:05:21.068
- ...from certain people.
- Just get away from her.

739
01:05:21.236 --> 01:05:24.322
It eats lungs so it can breathe...

740
01:05:27.075 --> 01:05:30.620
and eyes so it can see.

741
01:05:32.539 --> 01:05:35.333
It all becomes a part of it.

742
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:40.000
Whatever it eats... becomes a part of it.

743
01:05:43.466 --> 01:05:45.718
It dresses like a man...

744
01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:50.681

You've got something it likes, one of you.

01:06:24.841 --> 01:06:29.262
And it's not gonna stop chasing you
till it knows which one.

752
01:06:31.347 --> 01:06:34.058
- How?
- Never mind how.

753
01:06:34.225 --> 01:06:36.894
How does it find out,
by running people off the road?

754
01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:39.229
It needs to scare you.

755
01:06:39.397 --> 01:06:43.067
There's something in fear,
something it can smell.

756
01:06:43.234 --> 01:06:47.029
Something that tells it
if there's anything inside someone

757
01:06:47.197 --> 01:06:51.075
that it might... like.

You're telling us this thing
is out driving down the highway

759
01:06:56.247 --> 01:06:58.749
trying to freak people out
so it can smell them?

760
01:06:58.917 --> 01:07:01.544

Why are we standing here with her?

766

We ran it over till
there was nothing left.

01:07:17.977 --> 01:07:20.938

have we got emergency lights or what?
