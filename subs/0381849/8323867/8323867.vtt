1
00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:39.115
Dan...

2
00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:45.071
Maybe it's the wind.

3
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:55.973
No!

4
00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:01.003
No!

5
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.797
Please! Stop!

6
00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:06.134
Tucker!

7
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.807
You have a week, Evans.
Then we burn the house.

8
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:17.237
William?

9
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.522
Hey! William!

10
00:02:23.568 --> 00:02:25.153
Out. Out!

11
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.232
William!

12
00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:41.444
God damn it, William!
William!

13
00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:44.614
God damn it!
Put that down!

14
00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.340
- Come here!
- No!

15
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.750
Let go!

16
00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.182
It's the last feed we got!

17
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.203
I'll take care of this.

18
00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.333
No, you won't.

19
00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:54.867
Herd's over the ridge, by now.

20
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:58.020
You go get cleaned up.

21
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.048
You lied to me, Dan.

22
00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:13.678
You told me we made payments to Hollander.

23
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:16.597
We did...some.

24
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.883
How do you think
we bought feed, Alice?

25
00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:20.501
And three months water?

26
00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:23.212
Medicine for Mark?

27
00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:26.941
I had a choice between
our family and paying it down.

28
00:04:27.224 --> 00:04:29.435
We're supposed to make
decisions, together.

29
00:04:29.918 --> 00:04:31.671
Would you have made it any different?

30
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:39.245
Alice, we can't make it rain, together.

31
00:04:39.628 --> 00:04:42.873
Or turn the... dust into grass.

32
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.686
Can't stop Hollander from selling
our land to the railroad, either.

33
00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.050
It's too bad the doctors at Essex
saved so much of my leg.

34
00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:56.345
I read that the Pension Act
pays by the pound now.

35
00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.934
Stop looking at me like that.

36
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.437
You gonna tell the Marshal
what those men did?

37
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.230
Marshal ain't doing shit.

38
00:05:06.314 --> 00:05:09.191
- William.
- First thing, Mark,

39
00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.194
I'm gonna take you boys, and
we're gonna round up the herd,

40
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:13.446
and then I'm goin' into town.

41
00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:14.530
What are you gonna do in town?

42
00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.692
I'm gonna tell Hollander to make this right.

43
00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:20.119
I'm gonna tell him...

44
00:05:20.202 --> 00:05:21.621
to pay for a new barn.

45
00:05:23.247 --> 00:05:25.666
Maybe we should
just shoot him, like Will says.

46
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.406
Coach is headed for Bisbee, Boss.

47
00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.035
Girded with iron, Pinks on top,

48
00:06:01.118 --> 00:06:03.204
double shotguns,

49
00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:05.206
and a Gatling.

50
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.506
You shoulda let me save the feed.

51
00:06:59.343 --> 00:07:01.395
You gonna hock that?

52
00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:04.390
Someday, William...

53
00:07:04.473 --> 00:07:06.726
you walk in my shoes,
you might understand.

54
00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:09.920
I ain't ever walkin' in your shoes.

55
00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:11.480
Tracks over here.

56
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:27.423
Here we go.

57
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:32.102
Kenny, here we go.
Here they come.

58
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:03.701
Pull up!

59
00:09:05.102 --> 00:09:06.320
I got him!

60
00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.205
Use the gun.
Don't let 'em get it.

61
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.399
Mark, stay near.

62
00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:01.609
Mark!

63
00:10:07.698 --> 00:10:08.699
God damn!
Giddyap!

64
00:10:18.992 --> 00:10:20.110
Get down. Now!

65
00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:21.912
I got more!
Here I come!

66
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.284
Knock on 'em, Nonnie.
Knock on 'em.

67
00:10:44.368 --> 00:10:45.269
Keep 'em goin'.

68
00:10:55.696 --> 00:10:57.648
Pull up. Pull up.

69
00:10:57.831 --> 00:10:59.208
Pull up!

70
00:11:54.738 --> 00:11:56.448
Mornin', Pinkerton.

71
00:11:58.392 --> 00:11:59.852
Name's Charlie Prince.

72
00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:02.229
I expect you heard of me.

73
00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:06.775
Well, I heard of a...

74
00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:08.944
balled-up whore named...

75
00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:11.655
Charlie Princess.

76
00:12:12.339 --> 00:12:14.207
That you, missy?

77
00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:20.998
I hate Pinkertons.

78
00:12:21.081 --> 00:12:22.750
Byron McElroy.

79
00:12:24.585 --> 00:12:26.295
When did your hair
turn all gray, Byron?

80
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:30.215
Go to hell, Ben Wade.

81
00:12:33.635 --> 00:12:35.028
Well, would you look at all this?

82
00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:37.965
Y'all spared no expense this time, Byron.

83
00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.326
I gotta say, though,
it's probably cheaper

84
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.620
just to let me rob the damn thing.

85
00:12:49.242 --> 00:12:51.320
If you're gonna kill me,

86
00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:52.821
just as soon get to it.

87
00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:57.701
I ain't gonna kill you.

88
00:12:57.885 --> 00:12:58.886
Not like this.

89
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.333
Won't change a thing, lettin' me live.

90
00:13:06.627 --> 00:13:08.045
I'll come for you.

91
00:13:09.713 --> 00:13:11.715
I'd be disappointed, if you didn't.

92
00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:16.086
- She's lit!
- She's lit!

93
00:13:56.193 --> 00:13:58.028
- Yeah...
- All right, boys.

94
00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:06.019
There you go.
It's full.

95
00:14:23.979 --> 00:14:25.747
All right. There you go.

96
00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:28.083
Come on, give me one.
One more. One more.

97
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.505
I'll ask you
to put down the money.

98
00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:35.340
You step back!
You men step back!

99
00:14:35.424 --> 00:14:38.177
All of you step back right now,
or this man dies!

100
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.345
Not a smart move, friend.

101
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.023
Shit.

102
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.839
He's fast.

103
00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:11.376
Well, Tommy...

104
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.879
it seems that
there was a Pinkerton...

105
00:15:13.962 --> 00:15:16.381
inside that coach
that wasn't quite dead, yet.

106
00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:19.843
Now, I know Charlie told you,

107
00:15:19.927 --> 00:15:21.345
because...

108
00:15:21.428 --> 00:15:24.890
we done got but a few rules in this outfit.

109
00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:27.559
And this is what happens
when you put us all at risk.

110
00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:36.652
Mark, look at me.
Look at me.

111
00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.278
Keep lookin' at me.
Back up quietly.

112
00:15:38.362 --> 00:15:39.738
Back— William!

113
00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:42.199
William, look at me.
Back up.

114
00:15:42.482 --> 00:15:44.151
William, look at me.

115
00:16:07.432 --> 00:16:08.558
Mornin'.

116
00:16:11.478 --> 00:16:13.313
Those are my cattle.

117
00:16:13.397 --> 00:16:14.398
I want 'em back.

118
00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.696
Careful, rancher,
that's Ben Wade you're talking to.

119
00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.035
Well, I need 'em back.

120
00:16:28.412 --> 00:16:29.621
They're all I got.

121
00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:34.334
I don't need your cattle.

122
00:16:34.418 --> 00:16:36.837
But I will be needin' them horses.

123
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.233
So you don't go doing nothin'... foolish.

124
00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:04.823
Campos.

125
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.834
Find them on the road to Bisbee.

126
00:17:15.917 --> 00:17:17.169
Boys.

127
00:17:30.807 --> 00:17:34.311
They're probably
just running late, Mr. Butterfield.

128
00:17:34.894 --> 00:17:36.713
Pinkertons don't run late.

129
00:17:36.897 --> 00:17:39.066
That's why they're paid $18 a day.

130
00:18:42.729 --> 00:18:43.663
Get me on my feet.

131
00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:45.590
I think you're in pretty bad shape, mister.

132
00:18:45.674 --> 00:18:47.401
- You should just—
- Just get me on my damn feet!

133
00:19:00.063 --> 00:19:02.774
Mark, William, get me some of them boards.

134
00:19:26.856 --> 00:19:27.841
Can I help you?

135
00:19:29.025 --> 00:19:30.610
I think maybe...

136
00:19:30.694 --> 00:19:32.479
a coach headed for here got itself held up

137
00:19:32.562 --> 00:19:34.255
in the canyon about 10 miles back...

138
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:35.715
God damn it.

139
00:19:36.516 --> 00:19:38.518
...by Mr. Ben Wade, himself.

140
00:19:38.702 --> 00:19:40.062
How did you know it was Wade?

141
00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:42.623
It's been him the last 21 times, Marshal.

142
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:45.133
I saw a Mexican sharpshooter
and an Apache.

143
00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.360
- God damn it. Jesus Christ.
- And I've been told—

144
00:19:47.944 --> 00:19:49.112
Did you see The Hand of God?

145
00:19:49.196 --> 00:19:50.906
- What's that?
- His pistol.

146
00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:52.632
Why the hell didn't
you do something?

147
00:19:54.618 --> 00:19:57.304
They had a lot of weapons, mister...

148
00:19:57.787 --> 00:19:59.748
and they was shootin' bullets.

149
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.277
Let's go. We're wasting time.

150
00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:15.847
Where you from, anyway?

151
00:20:20.902 --> 00:20:23.204
Tom Conrad bought
a thousand head in Mexico.

152
00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:24.998
Hired us to drive 'em in.

153
00:20:27.475 --> 00:20:29.436
Let's go.
Come on, boys.

154
00:20:43.908 --> 00:20:46.119
Something's going on
with the railroad man.

155
00:21:37.971 --> 00:21:41.349
Ma'am? Some whiskey for my friends.

156
00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.646
Let's go.

157
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.231
- The bar's closed.
- Already?

158
00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:15.300
Here's to the four we lost in battle.

159
00:22:17.385 --> 00:22:18.553
And here's to the boss,

160
00:22:19.637 --> 00:22:20.497
who...

161
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.600
had to say good-bye
to Tommy Darden, today.

162
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:26.811
And that's too bad.

163
00:22:26.995 --> 00:22:28.913
Proverbs 13:3.

164
00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:32.400
<i>"He that keepeth his mouth,</i>

165
00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.486
<i>"keepeth his life.</i>

166
00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:35.987
<i>"He that opens his lips too wide</i>

167
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:37.405
<i>shall bring on his own destruction."</i>

168
00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:38.865
Amen.

169
00:22:39.048 --> 00:22:40.784
Tommy was weak.

170
00:22:40.967 --> 00:22:42.702
Tommy was stupid.

171
00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:44.371
Tommy is dead.

172
00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:48.875
I'd drink to that.

173
00:22:54.923 --> 00:22:56.424
Sutherland.

174
00:22:57.692 --> 00:22:58.635
Jorgensen.

175
00:23:03.564 --> 00:23:04.607
Campos.

176
00:23:07.894 --> 00:23:09.229
Jackson.

177
00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.649
Kinter.

178
00:23:30.792 --> 00:23:32.252
Marshal's only half-stupid.

179
00:23:32.335 --> 00:23:34.045
He's gonna be back soon.

180
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.609
They're going across the border.

181
00:23:40.735 --> 00:23:42.278
I won't be far.

182
00:23:43.805 --> 00:23:45.098
I'll wait for you.

183
00:23:46.182 --> 00:23:47.517
All right, Charlie.

184
00:24:01.197 --> 00:24:02.991
I've seen you someplace, before.

185
00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:06.161
Have you?

186
00:24:10.373 --> 00:24:13.084
You ever work for
a blind Irishman in Leadyville?

187
00:24:16.287 --> 00:24:17.297
I was a singer.

188
00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:23.261
The best time I ever had
in my whole life.

189
00:24:25.138 --> 00:24:26.347
What made you quit?

190
00:24:28.308 --> 00:24:30.018
Got to coughing.

191
00:24:30.301 --> 00:24:32.896
Doctor said I should find a drier climate.

192
00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:41.488
You know, I spent more money
in that joint than I could tell you.

193
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:45.483
Do you remember a girl?

194
00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:48.369
Her name was Velvet.

195
00:24:51.372 --> 00:24:53.291
Nobody forgets Velvet.

196
00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.967
You look kinda skinny.

197
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:10.225
I feel skinny.

198
00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:13.269
That's all right.

199
00:25:15.605 --> 00:25:17.273
I don't mind skinny girls.

200
00:25:19.192 --> 00:25:21.778
Long as they got green eyes
to make up for it.

201
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:26.115
Have you got green eyes?

202
00:25:38.545 --> 00:25:40.630
That's all right.

203
00:25:40.713 --> 00:25:42.173
They don't have to be green.

204
00:25:52.934 --> 00:25:54.836
Do you think they lied?

205
00:25:55.219 --> 00:25:57.438
Do you think they stole our horses?

206
00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:58.840
They don't need our shit horses.

207
00:25:58.923 --> 00:26:00.467
Watch your mouth.

208
00:26:13.246 --> 00:26:15.456
I'll take him into town on my own.

209
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.700
You boys go round up the herd.

210
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.402
Don't push them too hard.
I can't afford any more dropping.

211
00:26:21.762 --> 00:26:25.142
Mister, we're gonna have to lift you up
to get you on top of that horse.

212
00:26:26.425 --> 00:26:27.377
Here comes the Cavalry.

213
00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:34.275
Do as I said.

214
00:26:40.973 --> 00:26:42.059
Is he from the coach?

215
00:26:43.142 --> 00:26:44.302
Only one who made it.

216
00:26:44.485 --> 00:26:46.487
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?

217
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.947
It was Ben Wade.

218
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:49.991
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?

219
00:26:50.074 --> 00:26:51.200
Mr. Mc—

220
00:26:51.684 --> 00:26:52.945
This man needs attention.

221
00:26:53.828 --> 00:26:55.496
You see which way he rode, Evans?

222
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.299
Looked like they were headed to Bisbee.

223
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.135
You know...

224
00:27:51.219 --> 00:27:53.888
there's a little town
just south of the border...

225
00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:58.518
pretty little pueblucho,
down by the river.

226
00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:03.539
Folks would pay good money
to hear a white woman sing.

227
00:28:06.225 --> 00:28:07.360
Yeah...

228
00:28:07.443 --> 00:28:09.604
Imagine me shinning
on down to Mexico

229
00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:11.564
with Ben Wade on my arm.

230
00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:15.451
I'm not wanted in Mexico.

231
00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:20.790
Jump out that back window with me, now.

232
00:28:25.712 --> 00:28:27.588
You're crazy.

233
00:28:31.968 --> 00:28:33.011
You the doctor?

234
00:28:33.294 --> 00:28:34.220
Yes.

235
00:28:34.303 --> 00:28:35.513
Coach got held up.

236
00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:37.148
Get him on the table.

237
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.317
- What's his name?
- Byron McElroy.

238
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.978
He's a bounty hunter
under contract with the Pinkertons.

239
00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:01.289
You've lost a lot of blood, Mr. McElroy.

240
00:29:08.145 --> 00:29:09.130
That bullet's still in there.

241
00:29:09.413 --> 00:29:11.190
Well, get it out.

242
00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:22.661
All right.

243
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:25.772
Now, what I'm about to do
is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch.

244
00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:28.566
Ain't the first time I've been shot.

245
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.777
Hold him, please.

246
00:29:34.238 --> 00:29:35.656
Don't touch me!

247
00:29:39.827 --> 00:29:41.412
All right.

248
00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:18.366
What the fuck kind
of doctor are you, anyway?

249
00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:21.119
It's nice to have a conversation
with a patient for a change.

250
00:30:23.011 --> 00:30:24.497
You see anything down there?

251
00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:30.837
Marshal.
Wade's horse.

252
00:30:32.755 --> 00:30:35.341
Take the back.
We'll take the front.

253
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.649
What the hell are they looking for?

254
00:30:53.943 --> 00:30:55.695
Ben Wade.

255
00:30:55.778 --> 00:30:57.405
He held up the payroll coach.

256
00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:01.117
I want to talk, Mr. Hollander.

257
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.827
Ben Wade in Bisbee.

258
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:04.036
Shit.

259
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.872
We're movin' up.

260
00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:07.331
Mr. Hollander?

261
00:31:07.615 --> 00:31:09.083
Tucker, go on to the saloon.

262
00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:11.127
You got no right,
to do what you done.

263
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.253
You hear me?

264
00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:14.005
That's my land.

265
00:31:14.088 --> 00:31:15.798
Come next week it's not, Evans.

266
00:31:16.082 --> 00:31:18.526
You borrowed a good deal of money
and I got rights to recompense.

267
00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:21.220
But you dammed up my creek.
You shut off my water.

268
00:31:21.304 --> 00:31:23.306
How'd you expect me to
pay off my debts if you can't let—

269
00:31:25.132 --> 00:31:26.367
Before the water touches your land,

270
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.619
it resides and flows on mine.

271
00:31:28.903 --> 00:31:31.239
And as such, I can do with it
as I fuckin' please.

272
00:31:31.647 --> 00:31:33.065
Go home and pack up.

273
00:31:34.817 --> 00:31:35.943
Can you—

274
00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.820
Can you just
let me get to spring?

275
00:31:42.742 --> 00:31:44.577
I can turn the corner.

276
00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:50.074
Sometimes, a man has to be
big enough to see how small he is.

277
00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:53.793
Railroad's coming, Dan.

278
00:31:55.588 --> 00:31:57.423
Your land's worth more with you off it.

279
00:32:35.127 --> 00:32:36.337
Hollander!

280
00:32:48.849 --> 00:32:50.434
You look a little bent, rancher.

281
00:32:51.811 --> 00:32:53.354
You come to wake some snakes?

282
00:32:54.438 --> 00:32:56.565
Dan, would you like a drink?

283
00:32:56.749 --> 00:32:57.950
No, thanks.

284
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.827
You got your horses back, didn't you?
And your cattle?

285
00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.024
Yeah, I got my horses back.

286
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.244
But you killed two of my herd.

287
00:33:08.427 --> 00:33:10.679
Well, they died for a good cause.

288
00:33:13.749 --> 00:33:15.626
You know...

289
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.254
them beeves of yours,

290
00:33:18.537 --> 00:33:20.539
they wouldn't even have fed a hungry dog.

291
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.593
I tell you what.

292
00:33:25.594 --> 00:33:27.388
That should cover it.

293
00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.893
How much you get for a day's work?

294
00:33:33.477 --> 00:33:34.970
$2 when I hire out.

295
00:33:35.254 --> 00:33:37.005
Well, there are $2 for a half a day.

296
00:33:42.778 --> 00:33:45.281
You took up my boys' time, too.

297
00:33:49.785 --> 00:33:51.996
You're right, I did.

298
00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:04.133
Anything else you wanna get paid for, Dan?

299
00:34:07.403 --> 00:34:09.572
You can give me $5 extra.

300
00:34:11.574 --> 00:34:12.609
And what's that for?

301
00:34:13.492 --> 00:34:15.353
For making me nervous.

302
00:34:17.063 --> 00:34:19.248
Hands up, Ben Wade.

303
00:34:19.532 --> 00:34:21.809
Boss! Boss!

304
00:34:22.492 --> 00:34:23.352
Hey, Boss!

305
00:34:26.655 --> 00:34:28.282
Gimme your hands, Mr. Wade.

306
00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.701
- Tucker, take his gun.
- Gimme that.

307
00:34:33.245 --> 00:34:34.705
Ben Wade...

308
00:34:37.933 --> 00:34:39.310
captured in Bisbee.

309
00:34:40.753 --> 00:34:44.090
Be careful with that thing.
That gun's got a curse on it.

310
00:34:47.326 --> 00:34:50.838
- Laugh while you can.
- Crawley, go get the wagon.

311
00:34:50.921 --> 00:34:53.557
Make sure every weapon we got
is shoot-ready.

312
00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:55.518
I'll meet you out front of the office.

313
00:34:55.601 --> 00:34:57.144
We gotta get him outta here.

314
00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:58.729
Sure thing.

315
00:34:58.813 --> 00:35:01.023
I think we should shoot him, right now.

316
00:35:02.566 --> 00:35:04.735
Put a bullet right in his noggin.

317
00:35:04.919 --> 00:35:05.903
Do that...

318
00:35:05.986 --> 00:35:07.938
everybody in this
shit-piss little town

319
00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:09.982
will be dead by morning.

320
00:35:16.038 --> 00:35:18.499
22 robberies.

321
00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:23.011
Over $400,000 in losses.

322
00:35:23.595 --> 00:35:25.256
More in delays.

323
00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:31.053
The Southern Pacific will have Ben Wade
convicted in a Federal Court.

324
00:35:31.337 --> 00:35:34.890
Hanged. In public.

325
00:35:35.074 --> 00:35:37.284
An example made.

326
00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:39.854
And we will pay to make it happen.

327
00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:42.648
Y'all notice he didn't mention
any of the lives I've taken.

328
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.469
I need three more men.

329
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.893
You can have Tucker.

330
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:46.861
Good.

331
00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:49.071
I'm coming.
You only need one.

332
00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:51.615
You're wounded, Mr. McElroy.

333
00:35:51.699 --> 00:35:54.694
I rode in here.
Sure as hell can ride out.

334
00:35:54.777 --> 00:35:56.470
He goes, Potter's coming.

335
00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:57.855
What?

336
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.375
Doc can't shoot shit.

337
00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.919
I was best shot in my regiment.

338
00:36:04.603 --> 00:36:06.063
I'll come...

339
00:36:08.448 --> 00:36:10.401
for $200.

340
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.280
You fight for the North or the South?

341
00:36:15.864 --> 00:36:17.100
North.

342
00:36:17.683 --> 00:36:19.518
We're Southern in name,

343
00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:21.061
but Chicago-owned.

344
00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:23.289
Fine. $200.

345
00:36:24.306 --> 00:36:25.766
Let's go.

346
00:36:37.052 --> 00:36:39.680
- Thank you.
- Thank me when it's done.

347
00:36:48.163 --> 00:36:49.381
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

348
00:37:16.742 --> 00:37:18.493
This town's gonna burn!

349
00:37:23.598 --> 00:37:24.742
- Let's get him, Mark!
- Cover me!

350
00:37:24.866 --> 00:37:26.466
Doc! Kane's down!

351
00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:29.497
Shoot!

352
00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:33.767
Get him!

353
00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:37.179
Get in the coach.

354
00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.693
God damn it.

355
00:37:51.193 --> 00:37:54.989
Evans, Crawley, Tucker,
you need to mount up, now.

356
00:37:55.172 --> 00:37:56.699
Head for Evans' Ranch.

357
00:37:56.782 --> 00:37:58.409
I'll meet you there with the coach.

358
00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:16.852
How long does he have to be here?

359
00:38:17.236 --> 00:38:18.929
An hour...

360
00:38:19.313 --> 00:38:21.815
to make sure his outfit takes the bait.

361
00:38:51.078 --> 00:38:52.212
Hello, there!

362
00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:55.374
Evans! Can you give me a hand with this?

363
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:06.977
Whatever your wife's cooking in there,

364
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:08.804
it smells good, Evans.

365
00:39:26.446 --> 00:39:27.573
Let's go.

366
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.160
Good driving, Marshal.

367
00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.560
Remind me not to play poker
in this town.

368
00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.814
All right, Marshal.

369
00:39:52.397 --> 00:39:53.465
Give us a count.

370
00:39:53.649 --> 00:39:56.402
One, two, three.

371
00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.089
Good luck.

372
00:40:17.872 --> 00:40:19.525
You're gonna check on my family
when you come back, right?

373
00:40:19.708 --> 00:40:20.509
First thing.

374
00:40:20.592 --> 00:40:21.593
Let's go.

375
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:47.802
Ma'am.

376
00:40:50.455 --> 00:40:51.173
Byron...

377
00:40:51.256 --> 00:40:53.050
what an unpleasant surprise.

378
00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:57.705
What happens if they
catch the wagon?

379
00:40:58.288 --> 00:40:59.089
Well...

380
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.858
you saw where his man was.

381
00:41:01.124 --> 00:41:02.426
He's still gotta go fetch the outfit.

382
00:41:02.609 --> 00:41:03.844
Marshal's got a fast rig.

383
00:41:03.927 --> 00:41:06.013
They should reach
the fort before dawn.

384
00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:09.224
His gang can't do anything
in front of the whole 6th Cavalry.

385
00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:26.241
Did you have something
to do with that?

386
00:41:29.469 --> 00:41:31.397
I hope you're proud of yourself.

387
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:37.044
Just doin' my job, Doc.

388
00:41:40.663 --> 00:41:41.640
Thanks, son.

389
00:42:01.509 --> 00:42:02.945
We always wait to say grace.

390
00:42:04.128 --> 00:42:06.314
And we don't presume to teach
other people manners.

391
00:42:06.398 --> 00:42:08.283
Aren't we supposed to say
grace for murderers, too?

392
00:42:09.267 --> 00:42:10.561
Grace is for everyone, dear.

393
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.760
- Then why don't we say it?
- Mark.

394
00:42:13.588 --> 00:42:14.648
I'd like to hear it.

395
00:42:21.296 --> 00:42:24.466
God our Father, Lord, and Savior,
thank You for Your love and favor.

396
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.344
Please bless this drink
and food, we pray.

397
00:42:28.127 --> 00:42:30.730
Bless all who shares with us today.

398
00:42:30.914 --> 00:42:31.915
Amen.

399
00:42:31.998 --> 00:42:33.075
Amen.

400
00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.177
Amen.

401
00:42:35.727 --> 00:42:38.146
If my Pa wants to, he could shoot you dead.

402
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.858
He can shoot a jackrabbit at 50 yards.

403
00:42:42.434 --> 00:42:43.694
Shooting an animal's a lot different

404
00:42:43.777 --> 00:42:46.546
than, uh, shooting a man, son.

405
00:42:46.929 --> 00:42:48.281
No, it isn't.

406
00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:51.785
Not in my opinion.

407
00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:54.580
We could ask Byron, here.

408
00:42:54.863 --> 00:42:58.208
Now, Byron, he's killed dozens of people:

409
00:42:58.992 --> 00:43:01.011
men and women and children,

410
00:43:01.095 --> 00:43:02.179
miners, Apache.

411
00:43:02.962 --> 00:43:05.957
Not a soul taken
didn't deserve what it got.

412
00:43:07.526 --> 00:43:12.156
<i>"Every way of man is right
in his own eyes,"</i> Byron.

413
00:43:13.139 --> 00:43:14.682
<i>"The Lord ponders the heart."</i>

414
00:43:17.502 --> 00:43:18.620
Proverbs 21.

415
00:43:34.844 --> 00:43:35.645
Dan.

416
00:43:42.127 --> 00:43:44.163
You eat more when you're
nervous, Mr. Butterfield?

417
00:43:46.114 --> 00:43:47.541
Oh, why, thank you, Dan.

418
00:43:48.424 --> 00:43:49.576
Pleasant and kind of you.

419
00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:50.744
Much appreciated.

420
00:43:51.127 --> 00:43:52.839
You can cut that up for me.

421
00:43:54.022 --> 00:43:55.182
Oh, can you cut the fat off there?

422
00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:56.808
I don't particularly like the fat at all.

423
00:43:56.892 --> 00:43:58.685
I just...

424
00:44:00.729 --> 00:44:02.397
And the—

425
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.608
And the gristle.

426
00:44:04.691 --> 00:44:06.693
I don't like the gristle.

427
00:44:12.331 --> 00:44:14.910
You mind if I ask you how you got
that hitch in your step, Dan?

428
00:44:14.993 --> 00:44:17.329
Don't tell him nothing, Mr. Evans.

429
00:44:21.407 --> 00:44:23.268
Where were you stationed?

430
00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:29.307
Second Company Sharpshooters
out of Lynnfield, Massachusetts.

431
00:44:34.095 --> 00:44:37.749
My father was defending the U.S. Capitol,
in the District of Columbia.

432
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.993
Is that so?

433
00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:40.594
Well, Dan,

434
00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:43.013
tell me the story
of how you lost your leg.

435
00:44:43.697 --> 00:44:46.049
Did it get shot off, cut off?

436
00:44:46.933 --> 00:44:48.568
The Indians steal it?

437
00:45:00.113 --> 00:45:02.657
There's something moving
out there in the grass.

438
00:45:11.199 --> 00:45:12.518
There ain't nothing.

439
00:45:17.305 --> 00:45:19.808
<i>I think I saw something, over the ridge.</i>

440
00:45:21.143 --> 00:45:22.561
<i>What if they caught the coach, already?</i>

441
00:45:22.644 --> 00:45:24.980
<i>What if they already know it's Crawley inside?</i>

442
00:45:29.467 --> 00:45:32.003
You ever been to San Francisco?

443
00:45:34.197 --> 00:45:35.924
If it's all right by you, Mr. Wade,

444
00:45:36.007 --> 00:45:38.326
I'd rather we not talk.

445
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.697
So you've never been to San Francisco.

446
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.923
No.

447
00:45:47.852 --> 00:45:49.087
I knew a girl, there.

448
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:51.840
She was the daughter
of a sea captain.

449
00:45:52.523 --> 00:45:55.227
She had the most
beautiful green eyes,

450
00:45:56.911 --> 00:45:59.072
about the greenest eyes I ever saw.

451
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.272
Like yours.

452
00:46:11.092 --> 00:46:12.194
And I'd stare deep into them,

453
00:46:12.477 --> 00:46:14.646
and they'd just change color in front of me.

454
00:46:15.329 --> 00:46:16.798
All the colors of the sea.

455
00:46:26.474 --> 00:46:27.918
What'd you say your name was, again?

456
00:46:29.301 --> 00:46:30.320
Alice?

457
00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:36.093
Alice.

458
00:46:44.033 --> 00:46:45.185
For God's sake.

459
00:46:45.268 --> 00:46:47.145
He's killed more men
than the drought.

460
00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:49.231
He's not what I expected.
He's—

461
00:46:49.414 --> 00:46:50.749
He's dangerous.

462
00:46:51.232 --> 00:46:52.859
Dangerous is what he is, Alice.

463
00:46:53.643 --> 00:46:55.703
I don't want you or the boys talking to him.

464
00:46:58.564 --> 00:47:00.325
You can change your mind, Dan.

465
00:47:01.208 --> 00:47:03.153
No one will think less of you.

466
00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:07.032
No one <i>can</i> think less of me.

467
00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:11.169
Six months from now,

468
00:47:11.752 --> 00:47:13.130
everything's gonna be green.

469
00:47:14.013 --> 00:47:16.007
Cows are gonna be fat.

470
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.395
We might even see the steam
from the train coming over the ridge.

471
00:47:21.504 --> 00:47:23.440
We'll be all right.

472
00:47:24.558 --> 00:47:27.352
But we won't make it
through the next six days...

473
00:47:28.135 --> 00:47:29.988
if I don't do this.

474
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.318
Sorry, Dan.

475
00:47:35.802 --> 00:47:37.228
McElroy says five minutes.

476
00:47:49.707 --> 00:47:51.576
You think he's too much for me?

477
00:47:53.828 --> 00:47:55.806
He's a killer, Daniel.

478
00:47:57.082 --> 00:47:59.501
Then someone ought
to have the decency

479
00:47:59.684 --> 00:48:01.027
to bring him to justice.

480
00:48:06.899 --> 00:48:08.268
What are you thinking?

481
00:48:09.903 --> 00:48:11.571
I'm not out there alone.

482
00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.431
You know, have a little faith in me.

483
00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.418
Ben Wade has a gang,

484
00:48:16.701 --> 00:48:18.762
and they're out there, tonight, somewhere.

485
00:48:19.445 --> 00:48:22.449
If I don't go, we got
to pack up and leave,

486
00:48:22.932 --> 00:48:23.825
and God knows where,

487
00:48:23.909 --> 00:48:25.202
without a prayer, dirt-poor.

488
00:48:25.485 --> 00:48:26.828
Now, I'm tired, Alice.

489
00:48:27.112 --> 00:48:30.031
I am tired of watching
my boys go hungry.

490
00:48:30.315 --> 00:48:32.200
I'm tired of the way
that they look at me.

491
00:48:32.383 --> 00:48:35.012
I'm tired of the way that you don't.

492
00:48:35.595 --> 00:48:39.182
I've been standing, on one leg,

493
00:48:39.465 --> 00:48:41.084
for three damn years,

494
00:48:41.167 --> 00:48:43.286
waiting for God to do me a favor.

495
00:48:45.864 --> 00:48:47.907
And He ain't listenin'.

496
00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.461
<i>Mr. Evans.</i>

497
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.524
Oh, no, no, no, no.

498
00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:07.235
This is my horse, now.

499
00:49:10.955 --> 00:49:12.240
Come on over here.

500
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.334
Come on.

501
00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:22.167
Don't you be any trouble, Mark.

502
00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.243
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

503
00:49:27.572 --> 00:49:28.598
William.

504
00:49:29.382 --> 00:49:30.225
I want to come with you.

505
00:49:30.308 --> 00:49:31.276
Well, you can't.

506
00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:32.527
I could help.

507
00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:34.145
You're 14 years old.

508
00:49:34.629 --> 00:49:36.556
Look, I can ride faster and shoot better

509
00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:37.983
than any one of them.

510
00:49:38.566 --> 00:49:40.585
The Pinkerton's hurt,
Potter's no good,

511
00:49:40.668 --> 00:49:42.462
that railroad man's dead weight,

512
00:49:42.545 --> 00:49:43.513
and that other bastard—

513
00:49:43.697 --> 00:49:44.739
William.

514
00:49:44.823 --> 00:49:46.199
I don't have time to argue.

515
00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:48.994
I need you here.
That's that.

516
00:49:49.477 --> 00:49:51.020
That's that.

517
00:49:56.401 --> 00:49:58.753
So, boys, where are we headed?

518
00:49:58.837 --> 00:50:00.964
Ain't none of your business
where we're headed, Wade.

519
00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.727
You're a prisoner.

520
00:50:02.957 --> 00:50:06.002
You don't speak,
you don't piss,

521
00:50:06.285 --> 00:50:09.414
you don't goddamn breathe
unless we say so.

522
00:50:09.697 --> 00:50:10.949
You understand that?

523
00:50:14.669 --> 00:50:16.721
We're taking you to Contention.

524
00:50:17.004 --> 00:50:20.341
Putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma,
day after tomorrow.

525
00:50:20.625 --> 00:50:22.260
You shouldn't have told him that.

526
00:50:23.403 --> 00:50:25.030
Relax, friend.

527
00:50:25.513 --> 00:50:27.866
Now if we get separated,
I know where to meet up.

528
00:50:32.353 --> 00:50:34.564
I'd like to thank you
for your hospitality, ma'am.

529
00:50:35.047 --> 00:50:37.300
I hope I can send
your husband back all right.

530
00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:14.204
What did Ben Wade mean
about sending Pa back all right?

531
00:51:14.687 --> 00:51:16.247
Was he saying he was gonna Kill him?

532
00:51:16.331 --> 00:51:18.500
Ben Wade don't have to lift a finger.

533
00:51:18.983 --> 00:51:21.060
His gang will do it for him.

534
00:51:23.838 --> 00:51:26.291
Your father can take care of himself.

535
00:52:11.636 --> 00:52:13.263
So...

536
00:52:13.346 --> 00:52:16.558
were you conscripted
into Lincoln's army, Mr. Evans,

537
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.076
or did you volunteer?

538
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:20.361
Neither.

539
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:23.448
Maybe both.

540
00:52:23.631 --> 00:52:25.592
Now, what does that mean?

541
00:52:26.075 --> 00:52:28.161
Means I was a volunteer...

542
00:52:28.544 --> 00:52:30.404
in the Massachusetts State Guard.

543
00:52:30.788 --> 00:52:32.473
Then, in '62,

544
00:52:32.557 --> 00:52:34.367
the Federal Government
was running low on men,

545
00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.494
so they called in the state militias

546
00:52:36.778 --> 00:52:38.830
to, uh... protect Washington.

547
00:52:39.213 --> 00:52:40.999
And that's when you got hurt.

548
00:52:45.361 --> 00:52:47.655
What are you doing out here, Dan?

549
00:52:48.539 --> 00:52:51.092
You got a family to protect.

550
00:52:51.876 --> 00:52:52.752
You're not a lawman.

551
00:52:52.835 --> 00:52:53.812
You don't work for the railroad

552
00:52:53.895 --> 00:52:55.981
like Mr. Shiny Shoes, over there.

553
00:52:56.464 --> 00:52:57.932
You're not a Pinkerton.

554
00:52:59.216 --> 00:53:02.912
Maybe I don't like the idea
of men like you on the loose.

555
00:53:04.197 --> 00:53:06.949
It's man's nature
to take what he wants, Dan.

556
00:53:07.433 --> 00:53:08.676
That's how we're born.

557
00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.072
Well, I make an honest living.

558
00:53:13.756 --> 00:53:16.784
It might be honest,
but I don't think it's much of a livin'.

559
00:53:17.168 --> 00:53:19.712
You must be hurtin' bad
for money to take this job.

560
00:53:22.348 --> 00:53:23.900
Go to sleep.

561
00:53:28.045 --> 00:53:30.565
I imagine debt puts
a lot of pressure on a marriage.

562
00:53:30.848 --> 00:53:32.767
You imagine?

563
00:53:33.518 --> 00:53:35.670
What would you know about marriage?

564
00:53:36.453 --> 00:53:39.115
We can't all be cutthroats and thieves.

565
00:53:39.698 --> 00:53:41.943
Well, I know if I was lucky enough
to have a wife like Alice,

566
00:53:42.027 --> 00:53:44.571
I'd treat her a whole lot
better than you do, Dan.

567
00:53:45.054 --> 00:53:48.307
I'd feed her better,
buy her pretty dresses,

568
00:53:48.591 --> 00:53:51.002
wouldn't make her work so hard.

569
00:53:53.379 --> 00:53:56.190
Yeah, I'll bet Alice was a <i>real</i> pretty girl
before she married you—

570
00:53:56.374 --> 00:53:58.101
You shut up about my wife!

571
00:53:58.584 --> 00:54:00.053
You shut up about her.

572
00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.404
You say one more word,

573
00:54:02.187 --> 00:54:04.165
and I'll cut you down, right here.

574
00:54:04.249 --> 00:54:05.500
Right here.

575
00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:09.254
I like this side of you, Dan.

576
00:54:09.437 --> 00:54:11.356
Mr. Evans.

577
00:54:14.968 --> 00:54:16.219
Okay.

578
00:54:18.546 --> 00:54:20.673
It's my watch, now.

579
00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:56.401
<i>They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'</i>

580
00:54:57.668 --> 00:55:00.046
<i>Before the night is done</i>

581
00:55:01.647 --> 00:55:04.317
<i>They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'</i>

582
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.486
<i>I'll never see the sun</i>

583
00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.915
I suppose it's too much
to ask for a little quiet.

584
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.068
The way I figured it,

585
00:55:14.552 --> 00:55:16.587
is I'd be asleep
in my own bed right now,

586
00:55:16.671 --> 00:55:18.715
if it weren't for you.

587
00:55:19.098 --> 00:55:20.125
So if I got to be up,

588
00:55:20.208 --> 00:55:23.628
well, then, you're damn well
gonna be up with me, too,

589
00:55:24.311 --> 00:55:27.064
Ben Wade.

590
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.613
<i>They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'</i>

591
00:55:34.697 --> 00:55:37.408
<i>Before the night is done</i>

592
00:55:39.552 --> 00:55:41.595
<i>Hang me in the mornin'</i>

593
00:55:41.679 --> 00:55:45.150
<i>I'll never see the sun</i>

594
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:01.666
Son of a bitch!

595
00:56:17.081 --> 00:56:18.241
Enough.

596
00:56:22.303 --> 00:56:23.554
Enough!

597
00:56:23.738 --> 00:56:25.448
That's enough, McElroy.

598
00:56:38.219 --> 00:56:39.796
We have to bury him.

599
00:56:41.188 --> 00:56:44.634
Take the time... to dig one grave,

600
00:56:44.817 --> 00:56:47.486
might as well dig one for yourself.

601
00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.582
Let's go.

602
00:56:51.766 --> 00:56:53.084
Mount up.

603
00:56:53.167 --> 00:56:57.880
<i>Gonna hang me in the mornin'</i>

604
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:06.055
<i>I'll never see the sun</i>

605
00:58:21.739 --> 00:58:22.715
Don't you worry there, Boss.

606
00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:24.717
We're gonna get you
outta there in a second.

607
00:58:30.014 --> 00:58:31.032
Charlie!

608
00:58:39.824 --> 00:58:40.825
Wait! Wait!

609
00:58:44.195 --> 00:58:45.446
Sutherland.

610
00:58:50.034 --> 00:58:50.835
Jackson.

611
00:58:54.997 --> 00:58:55.965
No...

612
00:59:00.135 --> 00:59:01.053
No!

613
00:59:01.136 --> 00:59:02.387
Don't do this.

614
00:59:03.005 --> 00:59:04.051
Don't do this.

615
00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.375
Don't do this.

616
00:59:07.927 --> 00:59:10.054
- Where is he?
- Open the door.

617
00:59:10.137 --> 00:59:11.989
Open the door.
Let me outta here, God damn it.

618
00:59:12.073 --> 00:59:14.867
- Where did they take him?
- I don't know!

619
00:59:19.129 --> 00:59:20.273
Mister...

620
00:59:20.457 --> 00:59:21.624
you better tell me...

621
00:59:22.108 --> 00:59:24.527
where they took him...

622
00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:26.028
or you will burn.

623
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:33.836
Contention!
All right?!

624
00:59:34.219 --> 00:59:36.047
They're going to Contention!

625
00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:39.384
They're gonna put him
on the 3:10, to Yuma Prison, tomorrow!

626
00:59:44.088 --> 00:59:45.590
Let me outta here!

627
00:59:48.801 --> 00:59:51.387
Contention is...

628
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:54.473
80 miles back, the other way.

629
00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.893
We'd have to about kill our horses.

630
00:59:56.976 --> 00:59:58.269
So we'll buy new ones.

631
00:59:58.352 --> 00:59:59.645
Charlie...

632
00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.939
it's his own fault he got caught.

633
01:00:02.023 --> 01:00:03.524
He made a mistake.

634
01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:08.154
You think you could do
a better job leading this crew?

635
01:00:08.837 --> 01:00:09.838
Maybe.

636
01:00:15.995 --> 01:00:18.623
You forgotten what he done for us.

637
01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:27.281
We're going to Contention!

638
01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.395
Can't say I didn't warn you.

639
01:00:44.706 --> 01:00:46.625
There's a shortcut we could take.

640
01:00:47.551 --> 01:00:48.561
Shortcut?

641
01:00:48.944 --> 01:00:50.204
Through the pass.

642
01:00:50.287 --> 01:00:51.764
Takes you right through to Contention.

643
01:00:51.847 --> 01:00:53.666
Why didn't you say something, before?

644
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:55.660
That's Apache country.

645
01:00:55.743 --> 01:00:57.662
I thought the government <i>gave</i> them land.

646
01:00:57.745 --> 01:00:58.955
These are the ones refused to go.

647
01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.781
I wouldn't take that pass.

648
01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:02.333
Oh, you'd like us to take the long way?

649
01:01:02.616 --> 01:01:04.952
- That's right.
- And let your boys catch us?

650
01:01:07.229 --> 01:01:10.466
Mr. Butterfield, the Apache
that live in that pass

651
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:12.009
are the ones that stayed to fight.

652
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.095
They enjoy killing.

653
01:01:15.378 --> 01:01:17.181
You ain't gonna make it.

654
01:01:20.434 --> 01:01:22.144
We'll take our chances.

655
01:01:50.756 --> 01:01:52.633
Something on your mind, Dan?

656
01:01:54.301 --> 01:01:56.429
Why'd you kill Tucker?

657
01:01:57.012 --> 01:01:58.464
Why not me?

658
01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:00.016
Or Butterfield?

659
01:02:00.099 --> 01:02:02.018
Well, Tucker took my horse.

660
01:02:04.603 --> 01:02:06.272
Did you like him, Dan?

661
01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.399
No.

662
01:02:08.482 --> 01:02:10.317
He told me he burnt down your barn.

663
01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:13.279
He was an asshole...

664
01:02:15.114 --> 01:02:16.741
but wishing him dead and killing him

665
01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:18.909
are two different things.

666
01:02:18.993 --> 01:02:20.911
Your conscience is sensitive, Dan.

667
01:02:21.495 --> 01:02:23.055
I don't think it's my favorite part of you.

668
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:26.333
Button it up, Mr. Wade.

669
01:02:26.417 --> 01:02:30.254
You wanna talk to somebody,
talk to me.

670
01:02:30.337 --> 01:02:31.672
I don't like talking to you, Byron.

671
01:02:32.456 --> 01:02:33.582
Not when I have the gun.

672
01:02:33.766 --> 01:02:35.059
No, that ain't it.

673
01:02:35.742 --> 01:02:37.194
I just don't find you that interesting.

674
01:02:38.562 --> 01:02:39.738
Laugh it up, Doc,

675
01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.540
'till he guts you like a fish.

676
01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.993
Byron's like a song with one note.

677
01:02:44.276 --> 01:02:45.770
You ever read another book
in your life, Byron,

678
01:02:45.853 --> 01:02:47.063
besides the Bible?

679
01:02:47.146 --> 01:02:48.773
No need.

680
01:02:49.857 --> 01:02:51.984
Byron acts pious.

681
01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:55.571
Few years ago, when he was
under contract to Central,

682
01:02:55.854 --> 01:02:58.607
I seen him and a bunch of other Pinks

683
01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:01.360
mow down thirty-two Apache
women and children.

684
01:03:02.043 --> 01:03:03.037
Renegades...

685
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.456
gunning down railroad men
and their families.

686
01:03:05.539 --> 01:03:07.833
Picking 'em off the road, one by one.

687
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:08.938
Scalping 'em.

688
01:03:09.168 --> 01:03:11.462
There was young ones runnin'
around cryin' and screamin'.

689
01:03:11.545 --> 01:03:14.173
No more than three years old.

690
01:03:14.256 --> 01:03:17.176
And his boys shot 'em all,
then pushed 'em into a ditch.

691
01:03:17.259 --> 01:03:18.886
Some of them was still cryin'.

692
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:25.091
But I guess Byron figured
that... Jesus wouldn't mind.

693
01:03:27.019 --> 01:03:28.687
Apparently Jesus don't like the Apache.

694
01:03:30.764 --> 01:03:32.967
Keep on talkin'...

695
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:34.652
all the way to Yuma,

696
01:03:34.735 --> 01:03:36.487
right up them steps,

697
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:37.947
to the rope,

698
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:39.365
straight to Hell.

699
01:03:40.866 --> 01:03:42.910
Day I die, Byron,

700
01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:44.745
I'm gettin' sprung from Hell.

701
01:03:45.229 --> 01:03:46.380
I might feel the same,

702
01:03:46.563 --> 01:03:47.640
if I come from the seed

703
01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.750
of a drunk gravedigger

704
01:03:49.834 --> 01:03:52.211
and the rancid womb of a whore.

705
01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:06.392
Drop it, Dan Evans!

706
01:04:06.575 --> 01:04:07.668
Drop it.

707
01:04:07.952 --> 01:04:10.329
Toss that to the ground, Doc.

708
01:04:10.512 --> 01:04:12.348
Mr. Butterfield.

709
01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:17.361
Now I believe, Dan,

710
01:04:17.444 --> 01:04:19.196
you're carrying a pistol, as well.

711
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.781
I'd appreciate it if you take that out,

712
01:04:20.865 --> 01:04:23.117
and drop it on the ground.
Thank you.

713
01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:31.041
Now, I always liked you, Byron.

714
01:04:32.626 --> 01:04:34.295
But you never knew
when to shut up.

715
01:04:38.482 --> 01:04:40.493
Even bad men love their mamas.

716
01:04:46.265 --> 01:04:49.035
Now I think it's time
for everybody to go home.

717
01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.604
Don't you move, Mr. Wade.

718
01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:54.315
Let go of that shotgun.

719
01:04:54.998 --> 01:04:56.400
William...

720
01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:58.176
what the hell
are you doing here?

721
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.245
Now, I don't think
you gonna shoot a man

722
01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.997
you admire in the back
of the head, boy.

723
01:05:03.757 --> 01:05:06.852
Dan, tell your boy it's over.

724
01:05:07.736 --> 01:05:10.331
You think you can keep
your gun on him, William?

725
01:05:11.314 --> 01:05:13.083
I'm doing a damn sight
better than you did.

726
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.866
You ever been to Dodge City?

727
01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:07.137
No.

728
01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.808
Stop talking to him.

729
01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:16.280
The way you're shuffling those cards,

730
01:06:16.363 --> 01:06:17.840
I took you for a pro.

731
01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:20.601
I practice a lot.

732
01:06:20.784 --> 01:06:21.969
I can tell.

733
01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:31.403
You ever been to Dodge?

734
01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.529
Yes, indeed.

735
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.816
Meanest, most beautiful
dirty city there ever was.

736
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.168
Saloon was just overflowin'

737
01:06:38.252 --> 01:06:39.878
with cattle drivers, and road agents,

738
01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.563
prospectors, gunslingers,

739
01:06:41.647 --> 01:06:43.357
gamblers, and women.

740
01:06:46.093 --> 01:06:49.221
Women who'll do things to you,
you'll never forget.

741
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.235
They'll give you a disease you'll never forget.

742
01:06:52.433 --> 01:06:54.018
Money in your pocket in Dodge City,

743
01:06:54.101 --> 01:06:56.520
you can have everything
a man ever wished for.

744
01:06:58.772 --> 01:07:00.566
Everything a man comes to need.

745
01:07:03.902 --> 01:07:07.948
I got there on my own as a boy
not much bigger than you.

746
01:07:08.032 --> 01:07:10.993
And how many men
you killed since then, Wade?

747
01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.748
How many families you destroyed?

748
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.795
Quite a few.

749
01:07:24.423 --> 01:07:25.924
Is it true that you dynamited

750
01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:30.304
a wagon full of prospectors
in the Western Territories, last spring?

751
01:07:30.387 --> 01:07:31.889
No, that's a lie.

752
01:07:32.572 --> 01:07:34.483
It was a train full.

753
01:07:43.317 --> 01:07:45.611
Well, Dan...

754
01:07:47.946 --> 01:07:49.448
I gotta take a piss.

755
01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.619
You know, I thought
he was gonna shoot me,

756
01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:54.953
back at the ravine.

757
01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:57.956
I really thought
he was gonna do it.

758
01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.958
You know, there's
a wildness in his eyes.

759
01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.378
- It reminds me of—
- He's gonna be nothing like you, Wade.

760
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.920
William's got a head start
on the path of decency.

761
01:08:13.514 --> 01:08:15.015
Yeah, that's why I don't mess around

762
01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.996
with doing anything good, Dan.

763
01:08:21.288 --> 01:08:24.216
You do one good deed
for somebody...

764
01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.360
I imagine it's habit-forming.

765
01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:30.114
Something decent.

766
01:08:30.197 --> 01:08:32.116
See that grateful look in their eyes,

767
01:08:32.199 --> 01:08:34.159
imagine it makes you feel
like Christ Hisself.

768
01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.412
All right, I had enough
of this, Wade.

769
01:08:36.495 --> 01:08:38.163
Come on, let's go.

770
01:09:07.284 --> 01:09:08.085
William!

771
01:09:32.876 --> 01:09:34.169
- There's three of 'em.
- Yours?

772
01:09:34.852 --> 01:09:36.980
If they were mine, you'd be dead.

773
01:09:39.633 --> 01:09:41.343
Give me that gun, Wade.

774
01:09:42.936 --> 01:09:44.229
Wade?

775
01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:45.355
Wade!

776
01:10:31.777 --> 01:10:33.904
I told you not to come this way.

777
01:10:33.987 --> 01:10:35.447
It was McElroy's decision.

778
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.785
I told you there'd be trouble.

779
01:10:42.996 --> 01:10:45.123
Give me the keys to the handcuffs.

780
01:11:09.147 --> 01:11:10.649
Easy...

781
01:11:12.025 --> 01:11:13.277
Easy, now.

782
01:11:14.361 --> 01:11:15.362
Where is he?

783
01:11:16.245 --> 01:11:17.923
He's gone.

784
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:23.553
He took the horses with him.
I found this in the grass.

785
01:11:29.042 --> 01:11:30.919
What's the quickest way
out of the pass?

786
01:11:31.903 --> 01:11:35.440
He'll be looking for help getting his cuffs off.

787
01:11:36.174 --> 01:11:38.435
We're going after him?

788
01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:39.695
Well, there ain't no reward

789
01:11:39.778 --> 01:11:41.864
for getting him halfway
to that train, is there?

790
01:12:56.462 --> 01:12:57.547
I got to be honest with y'all.

791
01:12:57.631 --> 01:12:59.508
I like some of their food.

792
01:12:59.691 --> 01:13:01.927
As for wanting $40 a month, now,

793
01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.845
like them Irish up north—

794
01:13:05.906 --> 01:13:07.416
Goddamn Coolies.

795
01:13:07.599 --> 01:13:10.227
They'll work just fine
with my left boot up their ass.

796
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:12.771
Well, if could teach
a monkey to lay track—

797
01:13:13.054 --> 01:13:15.299
Well, what we need
is some Negroes

798
01:13:15.582 --> 01:13:17.076
brung in here, Mr. Boles.

799
01:13:17.118 --> 01:13:19.161
Show these Chinamen
what real work is.

800
01:13:27.802 --> 01:13:29.779
Holy Christ.

801
01:13:31.164 --> 01:13:34.418
- Who's that?
- That's him!

802
01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:39.673
You, help me with the handcuffs.

803
01:13:42.683 --> 01:13:43.301
Break the chain.

804
01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.396
Use the hammer.
Break the chain.

805
01:13:48.473 --> 01:13:51.852
<i>I got five guns on you
out here, Ben Wade!</i>

806
01:13:52.035 --> 01:13:53.478
<i>Best come on out!</i>

807
01:14:12.622 --> 01:14:13.790
Our horses...

808
01:14:36.813 --> 01:14:39.024
What in the hell's going on, here?

809
01:14:41.159 --> 01:14:44.570
Mr. Butterfield, all finished in Bisbee?

810
01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:46.339
Mr. Boles.

811
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.542
Better hurry. We're making the last blasts
through the mountains, this week.

812
01:14:57.826 --> 01:14:59.077
That's my prisoner.

813
01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.122
I'm taking him to Contention,
putting him on the prison train to Yuma.

814
01:15:03.681 --> 01:15:05.117
What prisoner?

815
01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:07.335
Come, now, Mr. Boles,

816
01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:08.878
that's Ben Wade you have there.

817
01:15:09.862 --> 01:15:12.798
Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother

818
01:15:12.982 --> 01:15:14.158
in front of me

819
01:15:14.242 --> 01:15:16.061
six years ago, in Abilene.

820
01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:18.730
Your brother was a lyin', bilkin' card shark.

821
01:15:22.359 --> 01:15:25.028
That is, if he's the asshole I remember.

822
01:15:25.111 --> 01:15:27.864
Could, of course, been some other
asshole I killed that I forgot about.

823
01:15:43.046 --> 01:15:44.589
You can't do that.
That's immoral.

824
01:15:47.968 --> 01:15:49.928
"Moral" ain't got a damn thing to do with it.

825
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:58.770
I was expecting to collect
a $200 reward for that man.

826
01:16:00.647 --> 01:16:02.816
I'm delivering him to Contention.

827
01:16:03.299 --> 01:16:04.751
I need that money.

828
01:16:04.934 --> 01:16:06.720
Need it bad enough to die?

829
01:16:17.038 --> 01:16:19.800
Well, at least let us take our horses.

830
01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:22.794
I got no problem with that...

831
01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:25.522
as long as you ride away, mister.

832
01:16:26.405 --> 01:16:28.149
Nice knowing you, Dan.

833
01:17:09.215 --> 01:17:11.635
Did you see me get that one
with the shovel?

834
01:17:13.053 --> 01:17:14.054
Doc! Dammit!

835
01:17:14.137 --> 01:17:15.221
Doc!

836
01:17:29.076 --> 01:17:30.036
Dan!

837
01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.298
Goddammit!

838
01:18:05.338 --> 01:18:07.757
Did we make it?

839
01:18:08.241 --> 01:18:10.026
Did we get away?

840
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:11.152
Yeah, Doc.

841
01:18:12.195 --> 01:18:13.530
We did.

842
01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:15.899
Thanks to you.

843
01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.892
We need a place to lay low.

844
01:18:43.176 --> 01:18:45.470
Keep him outta sight
'till the train comes.

845
01:18:46.813 --> 01:18:48.898
There's a hotel up here.

846
01:18:49.282 --> 01:18:50.834
I'll check us in.
You ride around back.

847
01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:52.652
All right.
Follow me.

848
01:18:57.949 --> 01:18:59.367
Hello, gentlemen.

849
01:19:00.952 --> 01:19:03.288
Hey, William, you go keep
a watch at the railhead.

850
01:19:04.471 --> 01:19:05.489
If you see them coming—

851
01:19:05.573 --> 01:19:06.674
I'll let you know.

852
01:19:08.067 --> 01:19:09.068
And William?

853
01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:29.213
There's a Can-Can on the hour,
if you're interested.

854
01:19:47.999 --> 01:19:50.001
It's the bridal suite.

855
01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:52.087
Hope you don't mind.
It's all they had.

856
01:20:06.726 --> 01:20:08.186
Well, well...

857
01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:11.815
That looks like rain clouds over Bisbee.

858
01:20:12.899 --> 01:20:14.984
You still need that $200, Dan?

859
01:20:15.068 --> 01:20:16.569
Shut up.

860
01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:22.742
Mr. Evans, you continue
to give me great confidence.

861
01:20:22.826 --> 01:20:24.953
Well, it ain't 3:10 yet.

862
01:20:25.236 --> 01:20:27.080
I'm gonna go see about the Marshal.

863
01:20:31.192 --> 01:20:32.936
Come on, move.
Let's go.

864
01:20:45.598 --> 01:20:48.685
We're looking for a group escorting an outlaw

865
01:20:48.768 --> 01:20:50.603
by the name of Ben Wade.

866
01:20:50.687 --> 01:20:53.106
Yeah, we been chasing him
through these tunnels.

867
01:20:59.253 --> 01:21:00.463
Who are you?

868
01:21:00.646 --> 01:21:01.898
What's it to you?

869
01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:05.451
Ben Wade... killed my brother.

870
01:21:05.535 --> 01:21:07.871
Then your brother... must be famous.

871
01:21:09.289 --> 01:21:13.835
You boys... some kinda... posse?

872
01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:28.541
I hate posses.

873
01:21:36.774 --> 01:21:39.494
So this is the bridal suite.

874
01:21:39.777 --> 01:21:42.322
Now, I wonder how many brides...

875
01:21:42.405 --> 01:21:43.573
have taken in this view.

876
01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:50.079
What are you gonna do
with your $200 now, Dan?

877
01:21:50.163 --> 01:21:51.456
Now that the rains are coming?

878
01:21:52.724 --> 01:21:54.934
I owe people money, Wade.

879
01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:57.078
That drought left me in the hole.

880
01:21:59.839 --> 01:22:01.799
Well, what do you think
about double that amount?

881
01:22:03.384 --> 01:22:05.470
You could pay your debts,

882
01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:08.056
buy a hundred more cows,

883
01:22:08.139 --> 01:22:09.641
build a new barn.

884
01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.643
How you reckon
I'm gonna do that?

885
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:16.189
Just lay down your gun
and let me walk out the door.

886
01:22:16.272 --> 01:22:17.982
It's worth $400 to me.

887
01:22:19.943 --> 01:22:21.653
Is that what you reckon my price is?

888
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.589
No.

889
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:28.701
No, I reckon it's a thousand.

890
01:22:28.885 --> 01:22:30.854
$1,000.

891
01:22:31.037 --> 01:22:33.456
Now, there's 10 times that amount
in Butterfield's coach.

892
01:22:33.739 --> 01:22:34.582
Oh, yeah?

893
01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:36.334
You want my cut, Dan?

894
01:22:36.817 --> 01:22:38.486
It's all yours.

895
01:22:39.195 --> 01:22:41.547
Isn't that kind of reckless of you, Wade?

896
01:22:41.631 --> 01:22:43.258
Seeing as, uh...

897
01:22:43.341 --> 01:22:44.842
you're so sure that, uh,

898
01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:47.136
your crew's coming to get you?

899
01:22:48.137 --> 01:22:49.639
Oh, they're coming, Dan.

900
01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.810
Sure as God's vengeance,
they're coming.

901
01:22:56.646 --> 01:22:58.356
But I just like to do things easy.

902
01:23:00.984 --> 01:23:04.028
Imagine what you could do
with a thousand dollars, Dan.

903
01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.530
You could hire
a couple of ranch hands.

904
01:23:05.713 --> 01:23:07.715
Your boys could go to school,
grow up smart.

905
01:23:09.133 --> 01:23:11.144
What about Alice?

906
01:23:11.327 --> 01:23:14.914
She would be the proud wife
of a bona fide Arizona rancher.

907
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:20.666
All you got to do is say yes.

908
01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:27.260
Well...

909
01:23:28.428 --> 01:23:30.463
Would you give me a bank note, Wade?

910
01:23:30.546 --> 01:23:33.933
Or... maybe you'd be kind enough
to make a deposit for me.

911
01:23:34.317 --> 01:23:35.693
Cash.

912
01:23:40.523 --> 01:23:41.916
Well, you— you tell me, Wade.

913
01:23:41.999 --> 01:23:44.819
How would I account for—

914
01:23:44.902 --> 01:23:47.530
For that amount of money?

915
01:23:47.613 --> 01:23:50.867
And what would I tell people
when I spend it?

916
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:52.785
That, uh—

917
01:23:52.869 --> 01:23:54.203
That you got the jump on me,

918
01:23:54.287 --> 01:23:58.249
you escaped, and somehow, I got a fortune?

919
01:24:00.793 --> 01:24:03.087
No. How dumb do you think people are?

920
01:24:04.071 --> 01:24:06.174
Nobody needs to know.

921
01:24:09.969 --> 01:24:10.970
You know what?

922
01:24:11.154 --> 01:24:13.030
Would you do me a favor?

923
01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.975
Don't talk to me for a while.

924
01:24:16.559 --> 01:24:18.353
You mean we're still not friends?

925
01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:20.579
No.

926
01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.050
No, we're not.

927
01:24:25.133 --> 01:24:26.210
Come five minutes to three,

928
01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:28.880
we're gonna be a hell
of a lot closer than you think.

929
01:24:37.663 --> 01:24:40.249
<i>They're gonna hang me</i>

930
01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:42.293
<i>In the mornin'</i>

931
01:24:44.003 --> 01:24:45.963
<i>Before the night is done</i>

932
01:24:47.632 --> 01:24:50.426
<i>They're gonna hang me</i>

933
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:52.470
<i>In the mornin'</i>

934
01:24:54.263 --> 01:24:56.724
<i>I'll never see the sun</i>

935
01:25:12.648 --> 01:25:13.491
Who is it?

936
01:25:13.574 --> 01:25:15.284
<i>It's me, Dan.</i>

937
01:25:15.368 --> 01:25:17.286
<i>I brought help.</i>

938
01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:20.665
You been gone a long time,
Mr. Butterfield.

939
01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:24.877
How do I know somebody
ain't got a gun on you, out there?

940
01:25:39.308 --> 01:25:42.603
Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane.

941
01:25:42.687 --> 01:25:44.856
- Marshal.
- Mr. Evans.

942
01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:50.862
Two of my finest men:
Harvey Pell...

943
01:25:53.039 --> 01:25:54.791
Sam Fuller.

944
01:25:55.274 --> 01:25:56.993
I'm sorry about all that, Marshal.

945
01:25:57.076 --> 01:25:59.120
- I really am grateful for the help.
- Don't mention it.

946
01:25:59.303 --> 01:26:02.056
So, you fellas really gonna
help put me on this train?

947
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:06.961
It may not seem like it, Mr. Wade,

948
01:26:07.044 --> 01:26:09.422
but we got law and order in this town,
just like any other.

949
01:26:09.705 --> 01:26:12.166
Well, that's <i>very</i> reassuring, Marshal.

950
01:26:13.526 --> 01:26:14.944
How much is Butterfield paying you?

951
01:26:15.327 --> 01:26:17.329
That's none of your business.

952
01:26:18.197 --> 01:26:19.448
You gonna come with us?

953
01:26:20.032 --> 01:26:22.534
Oh, I'll be walking with you...

954
01:26:22.618 --> 01:26:24.787
every step of the way.

955
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.369
You have my word on that, Dan.

956
01:26:27.598 --> 01:26:30.184
So there's five of us.
Five is good.

957
01:26:33.653 --> 01:26:35.147
It ain't enough.

958
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:37.958
It ain't <i>nearly</i> enough.

959
01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:03.017
- <i>Pa!</i>
- That's my boy.

960
01:27:06.145 --> 01:27:07.146
They're coming.

961
01:27:09.648 --> 01:27:10.775
They're coming this way.
I seen 'em.

962
01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:13.486
- Where?
- About a mile out. Same way we come.

963
01:27:13.569 --> 01:27:16.155
- How many are there?
- Seven. Eight.

964
01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:17.484
Which is it, boy?
Seven or eight?

965
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:22.111
Seven.

966
01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:34.740
Folks, sorry to bother you,

967
01:27:34.824 --> 01:27:36.701
but I'm gonna need you all
to move outside,

968
01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.094
as quickly as possible.

969
01:27:38.377 --> 01:27:39.595
That's it, folks.

970
01:27:39.979 --> 01:27:41.280
Thank you, very much.

971
01:27:41.364 --> 01:27:42.748
That's it.
Move along, folks.

972
01:27:42.832 --> 01:27:43.675
Move along.

973
01:27:46.769 --> 01:27:47.436
Come on, now!

974
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.854
- Hey! 
- Get out of the way!

975
01:27:51.565 --> 01:27:52.700
Right there.

976
01:28:11.385 --> 01:28:13.012
There sure are a lot of 'em.

977
01:28:13.646 --> 01:28:15.965
I didn't figure on it
being the whole gang.

978
01:28:41.357 --> 01:28:42.258
Boss.

979
01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:44.327
Boss?

980
01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:47.530
Boss, you in there?

981
01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:50.692
What do you want me to tell him?

982
01:28:52.076 --> 01:28:54.854
You tell him you'll write him
a letter every day from Yuma.

983
01:29:03.503 --> 01:29:04.797
You be careful, Wade.

984
01:29:10.269 --> 01:29:11.979
Charlie. Boys.

985
01:29:12.163 --> 01:29:14.081
- Hey, Boss.
- Yeah?

986
01:29:14.665 --> 01:29:16.383
Charlie, why don't you take the boys

987
01:29:16.466 --> 01:29:18.001
down to the saloon and buy 'em a drink.

988
01:29:20.196 --> 01:29:21.430
You okay?

989
01:29:22.214 --> 01:29:25.001
Oh, I'm fine. I'm just sittin' up here
with my four new friends—

990
01:29:25.084 --> 01:29:26.085
Hey...

991
01:29:28.087 --> 01:29:29.472
That's enough.

992
01:29:34.693 --> 01:29:37.112
Thank you, Charlie. Boys.

993
01:29:56.515 --> 01:29:58.433
Listen up!

994
01:29:58.517 --> 01:30:00.227
Listen up!

995
01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:04.490
That's Ben Wade
they have, up there!

996
01:30:04.973 --> 01:30:06.892
Ben...Wade!

997
01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:13.207
Now...

998
01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:16.752
The Railroad... <i>intends</i>...

999
01:30:18.587 --> 01:30:22.425
to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma...

1000
01:30:22.508 --> 01:30:24.260
and hang him.

1001
01:30:24.743 --> 01:30:25.861
What is he doin'?

1002
01:30:32.184 --> 01:30:36.981
We will give you... 200 cash dollars

1003
01:30:37.464 --> 01:30:40.776
to any man... who shoots
any one of his captors.

1004
01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.861
<i>How much?</i>

1005
01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:48.159
<i>200... cash dollars... guaranteed!</i>

1006
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.624
$200 guaranteed!

1007
01:30:58.711 --> 01:31:00.254
- Right here. You got me.
- Hand it over.

1008
01:31:00.337 --> 01:31:01.505
I'll tell you now, mister.

1009
01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:03.299
I'll take 200.
Gimme the money.

1010
01:31:03.482 --> 01:31:04.717
Well, you gotta shoot 'em, first.

1011
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:13.918
There's gotta be 30, 40
more guns out there, now.

1012
01:31:16.061 --> 01:31:17.672
Oh, to hell with this.

1013
01:31:20.131 --> 01:31:22.151
- Now just a minute, Marshal.
- Look, look.

1014
01:31:22.234 --> 01:31:23.527
If it's a fair fight, well, sure.

1015
01:31:24.311 --> 01:31:25.404
I'd stay for that.

1016
01:31:25.488 --> 01:31:26.489
A fair fight, that—

1017
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.327
That's a man's duty, but...

1018
01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:33.970
there's only five of us.

1019
01:31:35.831 --> 01:31:37.157
I'm sorry, mister...

1020
01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:39.593
But I'm not gonna die here, today.

1021
01:31:42.338 --> 01:31:43.506
And neither are my men.

1022
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:45.399
Marshal...

1023
01:31:48.168 --> 01:31:49.253
Forgot this.

1024
01:31:55.483 --> 01:31:56.868
Marshal—

1025
01:31:57.336 --> 01:31:59.755
<i>Marshal!
Marshal, what's the—</i>

1026
01:32:02.691 --> 01:32:04.902
Now, you see, Dan...

1027
01:32:04.985 --> 01:32:09.865
generally, pretty much
everyone... wants to live.

1028
01:32:09.949 --> 01:32:12.743
- I'll double your money.
- Let's go, boys.

1029
01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:15.788
Please. Do you wanna see us
shot down in the street?

1030
01:32:15.871 --> 01:32:17.373
This thing happened in Bisbee.

1031
01:32:17.456 --> 01:32:19.250
That means Butterfield, too.

1032
01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.985
Why bring your troubles to Contention?

1033
01:32:21.001 --> 01:32:23.838
We've got families.
Every one of us is a family man.

1034
01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.465
I'm a family man, too.

1035
01:32:26.489 --> 01:32:28.425
He's gonna walk out on you.

1036
01:32:29.909 --> 01:32:33.537
Then you best get out,
like the rest of us.

1037
01:32:36.392 --> 01:32:39.311
<i>He's gonna come back up here,</i>

1038
01:32:39.395 --> 01:32:41.355
<i>and he's gonna walk out on you.</i>

1039
01:32:41.538 --> 01:32:44.875
<i>Now, what you gotta figure
is why you and your boy</i>

1040
01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:47.252
are gonna die.

1041
01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:52.941
Because Butterfield's railroad
lost some money?

1042
01:33:23.155 --> 01:33:24.632
Is that all of 'em?

1043
01:33:24.815 --> 01:33:26.483
<i>- Get him inside!
- Get a doctor!</i>

1044
01:33:29.645 --> 01:33:30.546
Almost.

1045
01:33:33.324 --> 01:33:34.491
Your move, General.

1046
01:33:39.463 --> 01:33:40.998
What do you expect him to say?

1047
01:33:41.381 --> 01:33:43.383
I expect him to say something
that makes sense.

1048
01:33:44.043 --> 01:33:45.961
Something that might
save the two of you.

1049
01:33:46.045 --> 01:33:47.212
Take a look, Dan.

1050
01:33:49.214 --> 01:33:50.591
What's the matter?
You don't wanna see?

1051
01:33:51.574 --> 01:33:53.093
I'll see 'em soon enough.

1052
01:33:53.677 --> 01:33:54.837
What about you, kid?
You wanna look?

1053
01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.688
You stay away from
the window, William.

1054
01:33:56.872 --> 01:33:59.241
Go on, take a look.

1055
01:33:59.624 --> 01:34:01.560
Animals, all of 'em.

1056
01:34:01.744 --> 01:34:04.663
Campos, stand guard.
Jackson, back door.

1057
01:34:07.399 --> 01:34:08.943
They're gonna kill you
and your father, William.

1058
01:34:12.637 --> 01:34:14.949
They're gonna laugh while they do it.

1059
01:34:15.032 --> 01:34:16.241
I think you know that.

1060
01:34:16.925 --> 01:34:18.260
Call 'em off.

1061
01:34:20.179 --> 01:34:21.464
Why should I?

1062
01:34:21.747 --> 01:34:23.582
Because you're not all bad.

1063
01:34:28.337 --> 01:34:30.005
Yes, I am.

1064
01:34:30.089 --> 01:34:31.423
You saved us from those Indians.

1065
01:34:31.507 --> 01:34:33.175
I saved myself.

1066
01:34:33.258 --> 01:34:34.343
You got us through the tunnels.

1067
01:34:34.426 --> 01:34:35.928
You helped us get away.

1068
01:34:36.211 --> 01:34:38.973
If I'd had a gun in them tunnels,

1069
01:34:39.056 --> 01:34:41.016
I woulda used it on you.

1070
01:34:45.037 --> 01:34:46.246
I don't believe you.

1071
01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:50.025
Kid, I wouldn't last five minutes
leading an outfit like that

1072
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:51.694
if I wasn't as rotten as hell.

1073
01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:13.716
Dan?

1074
01:35:22.758 --> 01:35:24.460
I can't do it, Dan.

1075
01:35:24.743 --> 01:35:27.454
And if I can't do it,
you shouldn't do it, either.

1076
01:35:29.372 --> 01:35:31.608
Yup. They say discretion
is the better part of valor.

1077
01:35:31.692 --> 01:35:33.785
If... you think you have
an obligation to me,

1078
01:35:33.869 --> 01:35:35.395
or to the Railroad,

1079
01:35:35.479 --> 01:35:38.407
I assure you, you do not.
I'm releasing you.

1080
01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:40.492
It's just you left, Dan.

1081
01:35:40.776 --> 01:35:42.611
Just you and your boy.

1082
01:35:42.694 --> 01:35:45.572
Maybe he's right, Pa.
Maybe we should go home.

1083
01:35:53.839 --> 01:35:57.384
Well, what did Doc Potter
give his life for, William?

1084
01:35:57.568 --> 01:35:58.802
And McElroy?

1085
01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:00.888
Little red ants on a hill.

1086
01:36:00.971 --> 01:36:03.474
I'll pay you the 200, Dan, right now,

1087
01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:04.683
and you can walk away.

1088
01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:12.524
You know, this whole ride,

1089
01:36:12.608 --> 01:36:14.401
that's been nagging on me.

1090
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:19.114
That's what the Government
gave me, for my leg.

1091
01:36:20.699 --> 01:36:22.759
$198.36.

1092
01:36:22.843 --> 01:36:25.345
And the funny thing is that...

1093
01:36:25.429 --> 01:36:28.749
when you think about it,
which I have been lately,

1094
01:36:28.832 --> 01:36:31.960
was they weren't paying me,

1095
01:36:33.045 --> 01:36:35.798
They were paying me
so they could walk away.

1096
01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.168
Don't muddy the past
and the present, Dan.

1097
01:36:40.352 --> 01:36:41.278
No, no, no, Wade.

1098
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:44.148
I'm seeing the world the way it is.

1099
01:36:44.523 --> 01:36:47.184
If you take him to the train, Pa,
I'm going with you.

1100
01:36:47.267 --> 01:36:50.729
No, Mr. Butterfield's
gonna take you home.

1101
01:36:51.213 --> 01:36:52.815
- No, I'm not going anywhere with him.
- Yes, you are.

1102
01:36:52.898 --> 01:36:54.817
I'm staying here, with you.

1103
01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.244
You're gonna hold up
in a room across the hall.

1104
01:36:57.328 --> 01:36:58.996
You're gonna wait until we leave.

1105
01:36:59.279 --> 01:37:01.573
I'll get him to Bisbee, Dan.
I promise you.

1106
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:04.422
Oh, you're gonna promise me
a lot more than that, Butterfield.

1107
01:37:04.793 --> 01:37:08.255
I want guarantees... that Hollander

1108
01:37:08.638 --> 01:37:09.906
and his boys

1109
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:12.960
will never set foot
on my land again,

1110
01:37:13.043 --> 01:37:14.419
and that my water's gonna flow.

1111
01:37:15.103 --> 01:37:19.091
And I expect you to hand my wife
1,000 cash dollars when you see her.

1112
01:37:19.174 --> 01:37:20.801
You got money to spare.

1113
01:37:21.484 --> 01:37:23.137
I can deliver that.

1114
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.721
Just get him on the train.

1115
01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:27.991
You heard him?

1116
01:37:28.675 --> 01:37:29.818
I heard him.

1117
01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.358
William, I want you
to give this back to your mother.

1118
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:43.699
I want you to tell her that it helped me
find what was right.

1119
01:37:47.569 --> 01:37:48.779
Pa...

1120
01:37:50.289 --> 01:37:52.332
I can't...

1121
01:37:52.416 --> 01:37:53.792
I can't just leave you.

1122
01:37:54.076 --> 01:37:56.787
I'm gonna be a day
behind you, William.

1123
01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:59.339
Unless something happens,
and if it does,

1124
01:37:59.423 --> 01:38:02.384
I need a man at the ranch
to run things,

1125
01:38:02.567 --> 01:38:04.553
protect our family, and I know
that you can do that

1126
01:38:04.636 --> 01:38:07.389
because you've become
a fine man, William.

1127
01:38:07.472 --> 01:38:09.933
You've become a fine man.
You got all the best parts of me.

1128
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:12.519
What few there are.

1129
01:38:17.649 --> 01:38:21.361
And you just remember...
that your old man...

1130
01:38:21.445 --> 01:38:23.197
walked Ben Wade to that station...

1131
01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.657
when nobody else would.

1132
01:39:21.296 --> 01:39:24.466
You know, squeezing that watch
won't stop time.

1133
01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:34.643
Don't get so scared.
You might back a bad move.

1134
01:39:42.985 --> 01:39:44.361
You ever read the Bible, Dan?

1135
01:39:47.197 --> 01:39:49.074
I read it one time.

1136
01:39:49.557 --> 01:39:50.884
I was eight years of old.

1137
01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:54.579
My daddy just got hisself
killed over a shot of whiskey,

1138
01:39:54.663 --> 01:39:57.124
and my mama said,
<i>"We're going back East to start over."</i>

1139
01:39:59.042 --> 01:40:01.586
So she gave me a Bible,

1140
01:40:01.670 --> 01:40:03.880
sat me down in the train station,
told me to read it.

1141
01:40:07.217 --> 01:40:09.386
She was gonna get our tickets.

1142
01:40:11.413 --> 01:40:13.299
Well, I did what she said.

1143
01:40:14.683 --> 01:40:16.935
I read that Bible
from cover to cover.

1144
01:40:17.119 --> 01:40:18.745
It took me three days.

1145
01:40:21.773 --> 01:40:23.191
She never came back.

1146
01:40:49.701 --> 01:40:51.078
It's time.

1147
01:41:08.111 --> 01:41:10.781
It's a half-mile
to the station from here, Dan.

1148
01:41:14.409 --> 01:41:15.744
I guess we're walkin'.

1149
01:41:37.807 --> 01:41:38.817
There he is!

1150
01:41:44.739 --> 01:41:46.825
<i>Go and flush him out!</i>

1151
01:41:49.828 --> 01:41:50.963
<i>Let's get to it!</i>

1152
01:41:55.024 --> 01:41:56.234
Lucky.

1153
01:41:59.721 --> 01:42:00.763
Dan...

1154
01:42:03.383 --> 01:42:04.584
Thanks.

1155
01:42:04.668 --> 01:42:05.752
Move!

1156
01:42:30.852 --> 01:42:32.070
Come on!

1157
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.174
You might not get a chance
to use those Scofields, Charlie.

1158
01:42:38.476 --> 01:42:41.563
Perhaps you can explain to me
the next portion of your plan, Dan.

1159
01:42:59.481 --> 01:43:00.899
<i>By God, I got him!</i>

1160
01:43:05.812 --> 01:43:08.106
Hey.
Hey!

1161
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:10.066
Not the black hat!

1162
01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.710
The rancher,
you dumb-shits!

1163
01:43:12.493 --> 01:43:15.246
The rancher!
The ranch—

1164
01:43:26.441 --> 01:43:27.734
Charlie!

1165
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:32.722
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

1166
01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:39.855
Boss?

1167
01:43:40.964 --> 01:43:42.006
Boss!

1168
01:43:44.434 --> 01:43:45.977
Let's go.

1169
01:43:46.061 --> 01:43:47.479
The white door.
Move it!

1170
01:44:08.667 --> 01:44:09.834
All right.

1171
01:44:11.419 --> 01:44:12.796
I ain't doing this
no more, Dan.

1172
01:44:18.134 --> 01:44:19.377
I'm getting you
on that train, Wade.

1173
01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:21.388
Your son went back!

1174
01:44:21.471 --> 01:44:22.973
The boy's gone, hero.

1175
01:44:23.456 --> 01:44:25.475
Ain't nobody watchin' no more.

1176
01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:26.768
You still got that one good leg.

1177
01:44:26.851 --> 01:44:29.154
Why don't you use it
to get on home?

1178
01:44:29.937 --> 01:44:31.773
Charlie!

1179
01:44:32.556 --> 01:44:33.508
Charlie Prince!

1180
01:44:33.692 --> 01:44:34.693
<i>Yeah, Boss?!</i>

1181
01:44:34.776 --> 01:44:36.194
Hold your fire!

1182
01:44:36.278 --> 01:44:38.188
- I'm walking out!
- <i>Hold your fire!</i>

1183
01:45:03.346 --> 01:45:06.141
I ain't never been no hero, Wade.

1184
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:12.022
The only battle I seen,
we was in retreat.

1185
01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:14.566
My foot got shot off
by one of my own men.

1186
01:45:16.568 --> 01:45:20.113
You try telling that story... to your boy.

1187
01:45:20.196 --> 01:45:22.407
See how he looks at you, then.

1188
01:45:36.421 --> 01:45:39.507
<i>Boss! Boss?!</i>

1189
01:45:43.819 --> 01:45:44.987
Okay, Dan.

1190
01:45:56.173 --> 01:45:56.841
Son.

1191
01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:00.628
They're on the roofs!

1192
01:46:01.446 --> 01:46:02.456
They're on the roofs!

1193
01:46:03.998 --> 01:46:04.966
Boss!

1194
01:46:33.853 --> 01:46:35.814
Boss! Drop!

1195
01:46:40.819 --> 01:46:42.195
- Can you make this?
- Yeah.

1196
01:46:55.124 --> 01:46:55.950
Come on.

1197
01:46:56.434 --> 01:46:57.652
Come on!

1198
01:47:16.688 --> 01:47:18.857
<i>Go! Run!</i>

1199
01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:48.653
Spread out!

1200
01:48:01.416 --> 01:48:02.667
What time is it?

1201
01:48:03.927 --> 01:48:05.512
About 10 past 3.

1202
01:48:05.695 --> 01:48:07.655
Where's the 3:10 to Yuma?

1203
01:48:07.739 --> 01:48:09.032
Runnin' late, I suppose.

1204
01:48:09.215 --> 01:48:10.216
How late?!

1205
01:48:11.517 --> 01:48:12.694
Beats me.

1206
01:48:12.877 --> 01:48:13.953
Gets here when it gets here.

1207
01:48:14.337 --> 01:48:17.090
Goddamn trains.
Never can rely on 'em, huh?

1208
01:48:25.507 --> 01:48:26.716
<i>By the window!</i>

1209
01:48:55.937 --> 01:48:57.147
You know...

1210
01:48:59.899 --> 01:49:01.276
I ain't stubborn.

1211
01:49:03.477 --> 01:49:04.737
Excuse me?

1212
01:49:06.088 --> 01:49:07.790
You said I was stubborn...

1213
01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:10.243
for keeping my family
on a dyin' ranch.

1214
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:14.055
It's my son, Mark.

1215
01:49:14.638 --> 01:49:16.140
The young one?

1216
01:49:16.424 --> 01:49:20.261
He got tuberculosis... when he was two.

1217
01:49:20.644 --> 01:49:22.588
The doctor said he'd die,

1218
01:49:22.672 --> 01:49:24.357
if he didn't have a dry climate, so—

1219
01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.984
Why are you telling me this?

1220
01:49:28.427 --> 01:49:29.988
I don't know.

1221
01:49:30.571 --> 01:49:32.240
I guess I just...

1222
01:49:32.623 --> 01:49:37.670
wanted you to know
that... I ain't stubborn, is all.

1223
01:50:12.614 --> 01:50:15.450
<i>Well, as long as we're
making confessions—</i>

1224
01:50:15.833 --> 01:50:16.676
<i>Yeah?</i>

1225
01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:19.120
I've been to Yuma Prison, before.

1226
01:50:21.823 --> 01:50:22.832
Twice.

1227
01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:24.626
Escaped twice, too.

1228
01:51:30.966 --> 01:51:32.844
First car, sliding door.

1229
01:51:45.715 --> 01:51:46.808
They'll be comin'!

1230
01:52:09.764 --> 01:52:10.665
Yeah!

1231
01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:28.249
I got a prisoner to go to Yuma!

1232
01:52:35.239 --> 01:52:36.758
Well, you did it, Dan.

1233
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:39.318
No!

1234
01:52:50.638 --> 01:52:51.856
Pa.

1235
01:53:20.192 --> 01:53:23.020
For a one-leg rancher...

1236
01:53:26.131 --> 01:53:28.676
he's one tough son of a bitch.

1237
01:53:30.686 --> 01:53:31.921
Yeah.

1238
01:54:35.426 --> 01:54:36.969
You done it, Pa.

1239
01:54:39.963 --> 01:54:41.465
You done it.

1240
01:54:43.659 --> 01:54:45.869
You got him on the train.

1241
01:55:41.917 --> 01:55:43.544
Pa.
