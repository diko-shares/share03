1
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.807
Dan...

2
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.063
Maybe it's the wind.

3
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:56.866
No!

4
00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:01.996
Stop!

5
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.790
Please! Stop!

6
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.126
Tucker!

7
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.800
You have a week, Evans.
Then we burn the house.

8
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.429
William?

9
00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:20.515
Hey! William!

10
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.145
Out. Out!

11
00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.025
William!

12
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.537
God damn it, William!
William!

13
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.706
God damn it!
Put that down!

14
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.333
- Come here!
- Let go!

15
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.543
Let go!

16
00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:55.174
It's the last feed we got!

17
00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.195
I'll take care of this.

18
00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:21.325
No, you won't.

19
00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.860
Herd's over the ridge by now.

20
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.613
You go get cleaned up.

21
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.041
You lied to me, Dan.

22
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:14.670
You told me we made payments to Hollander.

23
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:17.590
We did... some.

24
00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:20.176
How do you think
we bought feed, Alice?

25
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.594
Three months water?

26
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.804
Medicine for Mark?

27
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.934
I had a choice between
our family and paying it down.

28
00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.227
We're supposed to make
decisions together.

29
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.563
Would you have made it any different?

30
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:40.237
Alice, we can't make it rain together.

31
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:43.866
Or turn the dust into grass.

32
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.535
Can't stop Hollander from selling
our land to the railroad, either.

33
00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:54.043
It's too bad the doctors at Essex
saved so much of my leg.

34
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:57.338
I read that the pension act
pays by the pound now.

35
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.927
Stop looking at me like that.

36
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.429
You gonna tell the marshal
what those men did?

37
00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.223
Marshal ain't doing shit.

38
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.184
- William.
- First thing, Mark,

39
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.187
I'm gonna take you boys, and
we're gonna round up the herd,

40
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.438
and then I'm goin' into town.

41
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:15.523
What are you gonna do in town?

42
00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.985
I'm gonna tell Hollander to make this right.

43
00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.112
I'm gonna tell him...

44
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.613
to pay for a new barn.

45
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.659
Maybe we should
just shoot him like Will says.

46
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.399
Coach is headed for Bisbee, Boss.

47
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.028
Girded with iron, Pinks on top,

48
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.196
double shotguns,

49
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.198
and a Gatling.

50
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.499
You shoulda let me save the feed.

51
00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.588
You gonna hock that?

52
00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.382
Someday, William...

53
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.718
you walk in my shoes,
you might understand.

54
00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:11.013
I ain't ever walking in your shoes.

55
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.473
Tracks over here.

56
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.215
Here we go.

57
00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:32.595
- Kenny, here we go.
- Here they come.

58
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.793
Pull that way!

59
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.213
Now that one!

60
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.997
Use the gun.
Don't let 'em get it.

61
00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:01.392
Mark, stay near.

62
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.601
Mark!

63
00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:09.692
God damn!
Giddyap!

64
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.203
Get down. Now!

65
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:22.705
I got more!
Here I come!

66
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.977
Knock on 'em, Nonnie.
Knock on 'em.

67
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.061
Keep 'em goin'.

68
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.741
Pull up. Pull up.

69
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.701
Pull up!

70
00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.341
Morning, Pinkerton.

71
00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.844
Name's Charlie Prince.

72
00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.721
I expect you heard of me.

73
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.768
Well, I heard of a...

74
00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.937
balled-up whore named...

75
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.648
Charlie Princess.

76
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.900
That you, missy?

77
00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.990
I hate Pinkertons.

78
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.742
Byron McElroy.

79
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.287
When did your hair
turn all gray, Byron?

80
00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:31.208
Go to hell, Ben Wade.

81
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:35.921
Well, would you look at all this?

82
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.757
Y'all spared no expense this time, Byron.

83
00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:42.219
I gotta say, though,
it's probably cheaper

84
00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.513
just to let me rob the damn thing.

85
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.312
If you're gonna kill me,

86
00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.814
just as soon get to it.

87
00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.694
I ain't gonna kill you.

88
00:12:58.778 --> 00:12:59.778
Not like this.

89
00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:05.325
Won't change a thing, lettin' me live.

90
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.037
I'll come for you.

91
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.708
I'd be disappointed if you didn't.

92
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.879
- She's lit!
- She's lit!

93
00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:58.921
All right, boys.

94
00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:07.012
There you go.
It's full.

95
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.740
All right. There you go.

96
00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.076
Come on, give me one.
One more.

97
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.498
I'll ask you
to put down the money.

98
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.333
You step back!
You men step back!

99
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.169
All of you step back right now,
or this man dies!

100
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.338
Not a smart move, friend.

101
00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:51.890
Shit.

102
00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.731
He's fast.

103
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.369
Well, Tommy...

104
00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:14.871
it seems that
there was a Pinkerton...

105
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.374
inside that coach
that wasn't quite dead yet.

106
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.836
Now, I know Charlie told you,

107
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.337
because...

108
00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.882
we done got but a few rules in this outfit.

109
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:28.552
And this is what happens
when you put us all at risk.

110
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.644
Mark, look at me.
Look at me.

111
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.271
Keep lookin' at me.
Back up quietly.

112
00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:40.731
Back... William!

113
00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.191
William, look at me.
Back up.

114
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.943
William, look at me.

115
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.551
Morning.

116
00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.306
Those are my cattle.

117
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.390
I want 'em back.

118
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.688
Careful, rancher,
that's Ben Wade you're talking to.

119
00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.028
Well, I need 'em back.

120
00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:30.614
They're all I got.

121
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.327
I don't need your cattle.

122
00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:37.829
But I will be needin' them horses.

123
00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:42.626
So you don't go doing nothing... foolish.

124
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:05.816
Campos.

125
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.827
You'll find them on the road to Bisbee.

126
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.161
Boys.

127
00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:35.303
They're probably
just running late, Mr. Butterfield.

128
00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.806
Pinkertons don't run late.

129
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.058
That's why they're paid $18 a day.

130
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.456
Get me on my feet.

131
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.583
I think you're in pretty bad shape, mister.

132
00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.794
- You should...
- Just get me on my damn feet.

133
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.767
Mark, William, get me some of them boards.

134
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.834
Can I help you?

135
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.503
I think maybe...

136
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.171
a coach headed for here got itself held up

137
00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.048
in the canyon about 10 miles back...

138
00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:36.508
God damn it.

139
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.511
by Mr. Ben Wade himself.

140
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.555
How did you know it was Wade?

141
00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.015
It's been him the last 21 times, Marshal.

142
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.226
I saw a Mexican sharpshooter
and an Apache.

143
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.353
- God damn it. Jesus Christ.
- And I've been told...

144
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:50.105
Did you see The Hand of God?

145
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:51.898
- What's that?
- His pistol.

146
00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.525
Why the hell didn't
you do something?

147
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:58.697
They had a lot of weapons, mister...

148
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:00.740
and they were shootin' bullets.

149
00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.701
Let's go. We're wasting time.

150
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:16.840
Where you from, anyway?

151
00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:24.097
Tom Conrad bought
a thousand head in Mexico.

152
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:25.891
Hired us to drive 'em in.

153
00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.228
Let's go.
Come on, boys.

154
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.912
Something's going on
with the railroad man.

155
00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:42.342
Ma'am? Some whiskey for my friends.

156
00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.639
Let's go.

157
00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.224
- The bar's closed.
- Already?

158
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.292
Here's to the four we lost in battle.

159
00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:19.546
And here's to the boss,

160
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.589
who...

161
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:24.592
had to say good-bye
to Tommy Darden today.

162
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.804
And that's too bad.

163
00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:29.806
Proverbs 13:3.

164
00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.393
"He that keepeth his mouth,

165
00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:35.478
"keepeth his life.

166
00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:36.980
"He that opens his lips too wide

167
00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:38.398
shall bring on his own destruction."

168
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:39.858
Amen.

169
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:41.776
Tommy was weak.

170
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.695
Tommy was stupid.

171
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.363
Tommy is dead.

172
00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:49.868
I'd drink to that.

173
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:57.417
Sutherland.

174
00:22:58.586 --> 00:22:59.627
Jorgensen.

175
00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:05.300
Campos.

176
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:10.221
Jackson.

177
00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:13.641
Kinter.

178
00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:33.244
Marshal's only half stupid.

179
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:35.038
He's gonna be back soon.

180
00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:40.502
They're going across the border.

181
00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:43.171
I won't be far.

182
00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.091
I'll wait for you.

183
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.510
All right, Charlie.

184
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:03.983
I've seen you someplace before.

185
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.153
Have you?

186
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:14.077
You ever work for
a blind Irishman in Leadville?

187
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:18.289
I was a singer.

188
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:24.254
The best time I ever had
in my whole life.

189
00:24:26.132 --> 00:24:27.340
What made you quit?

190
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.010
Got to coughing.

191
00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:33.888
Doctor said I should find a drier climate.

192
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:42.480
You know, I spent more money
in that joint than I could tell you.

193
00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:46.276
Do you remember a girl?

194
00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:49.362
Her name was Velvet.

195
00:24:52.366 --> 00:24:54.284
Nobody forgets Velvet.

196
00:25:02.126 --> 00:25:03.960
You look kinda skinny.

197
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:11.217
I feel skinny.

198
00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:14.262
That's all right.

199
00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:18.266
I don't mind skinny girls.

200
00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:22.770
Long as they got green eyes
to make up for it.

201
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.108
Have you got green eyes?

202
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.623
That's all right.

203
00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:43.166
They don't have to be green.

204
00:25:53.928 --> 00:25:55.929
Do you think they lied?

205
00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:58.431
Do you think they stole our horses?

206
00:25:58.515 --> 00:25:59.933
They don't need our shit horses.

207
00:26:00.017 --> 00:26:01.559
Watch your mouth.

208
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.449
I'll take him into town on my own.

209
00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:18.493
You boys go round up the herd.

210
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.372
Don't push them too hard.
I can't afford any more dropping.

211
00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:26.834
Mister, we're gonna have to lift you up
to get you on top of that horse.

212
00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:28.670
Here comes the Cavalry.

213
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:34.968
Do as I said.

214
00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:43.851
Is he from the coach?

215
00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:45.395
Only one who made it.

216
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:47.480
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?

217
00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:48.940
It was Ben Wade.

218
00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:50.984
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?

219
00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:52.193
Mr. Mc...

220
00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:54.737
This man needs attention.

221
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:56.489
You see which way he rode, Evans?

222
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:58.992
Looked like they were headed to Bisbee.

223
00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:52.128
You know...

224
00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:54.881
there's a little town
just south of the border...

225
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.510
pretty little pueblucho
down by the river.

226
00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:04.432
Folks would pay good money
to hear a white woman sing.

227
00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:08.353
Yeah.

228
00:28:08.437 --> 00:28:10.396
Imagine me shinning
on down to Mexico

229
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:12.357
with Ben Wade on my arm.

230
00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:16.444
I'm not wanted in Mexico.

231
00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:21.783
Jump out that back window with me now.

232
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.581
You're crazy.

233
00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:34.003
You the doctor?

234
00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:35.213
Yes.

235
00:28:35.297 --> 00:28:36.506
Coach got held up.

236
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.341
Get him on the table.

237
00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:49.310
- What's his name?
- Byron McElroy.

238
00:28:49.395 --> 00:28:51.771
He's a bounty hunter
under contract with the Pinkertons.

239
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:02.281
You've lost a lot of blood, Mr. McElroy.

240
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:10.123
That bullet's still in there.

241
00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:12.083
Well, get it out.

242
00:29:22.386 --> 00:29:24.053
All right.

243
00:29:24.138 --> 00:29:26.764
Now, what I'm about to do
is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch.

244
00:29:26.849 --> 00:29:29.559
Ain't the first time I been shot.

245
00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:31.769
Hold him, please.

246
00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:36.649
Don't touch me.

247
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:42.405
All right.

248
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:19.358
What the fuck kind
of doctor are you, anyway?

249
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:22.111
It's nice to have a conversation
with a patient for a change.

250
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:25.490
You see anything down there?

251
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.829
Marshal.
Wade's horse.

252
00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:35.833
Take the back.
We'll take the front.

253
00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.642
What the hell are they looking for?

254
00:30:54.937 --> 00:30:56.687
Ben Wade.

255
00:30:56.772 --> 00:30:58.397
He held up the payroll coach.

256
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.109
I want to talk, Mr. Hollander.

257
00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:03.819
Ben Wade in Bisbee.

258
00:31:03.904 --> 00:31:05.029
Shit.

259
00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:06.864
We're movin' up.

260
00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:08.324
Mr. Hollander?

261
00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:10.076
Tucker, go on to the saloon.

262
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.119
You got no right
to do what you done.

263
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:13.246
You hear me?

264
00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:14.997
That's my land.

265
00:31:15.082 --> 00:31:16.791
Come next week it's not, Evans.

266
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:19.418
You borrowed a good deal of money
and I got rights to recompense.

267
00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:22.213
But you dammed up my creek.
You shut off my water.

268
00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:24.298
How'd you expect me
to pay off my debts if you can't...

269
00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:27.260
Before the water touches your land,

270
00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:29.512
it resides and flows on mine.

271
00:31:29.596 --> 00:31:32.431
And as such, I can do with it
as I fuckin' please.

272
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:34.058
Go home and pack up.

273
00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:36.936
Can you...

274
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.813
Can you just
let me get to spring?

275
00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.570
I can turn the corner.

276
00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:50.866
Sometimes a man has to be
big enough to see how small he is.

277
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.620
Railroad's coming, Dan.

278
00:31:56.582 --> 00:31:58.416
Your land's worth more with you off it.

279
00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:37.330
Hollander!

280
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:51.427
You look a little bent, rancher.

281
00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.347
You come to wake some snakes?

282
00:32:55.432 --> 00:32:57.558
Dan, would you like a drink?

283
00:32:57.643 --> 00:32:59.143
No, thanks.

284
00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:01.854
You got your horses back, didn't you?
And your cattle?

285
00:33:04.274 --> 00:33:05.816
Yeah, I got my horses back.

286
00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:09.236
But you killed two of my herd.

287
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.572
Well, they died for a good cause.

288
00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:16.619
You know...

289
00:33:16.703 --> 00:33:19.246
them beeves of yours,

290
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.332
they wouldn't even have fed a hungry dog.

291
00:33:23.794 --> 00:33:25.586
I tell you what.

292
00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:28.381
That should cover it.

293
00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.886
How much you get for a day's work?

294
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.763
$2 when I hire out.

295
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.598
Well, there are $2 for a half a day.

296
00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:46.273
You took up my boys' time, too.

297
00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.988
You're right, I did.

298
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:05.126
Anything else you wanna get paid for, Dan?

299
00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:10.464
You can give me $5 extra.

300
00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:14.301
And what's that for?

301
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:16.345
For making me nervous.

302
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.641
Hands up, Ben Wade.

303
00:34:20.726 --> 00:34:22.601
Boss! Boss!

304
00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:24.145
Hey, Boss!

305
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:29.275
Gimme your hands, Mr. Wade.

306
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.694
- Tucker, take his gun.
- Gimme that.

307
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.197
Ben Wade...

308
00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:40.202
captured in Bisbee.

309
00:34:41.747 --> 00:34:45.082
Be careful with that thing.
That gun's got a curse on it.

310
00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:51.630
- Laugh while you can.
- Crawley, go get the wagon.

311
00:34:51.715 --> 00:34:54.550
Make sure every weapon we got
is shoot-ready.

312
00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:56.510
I'll meet you out front of the office.

313
00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:58.137
We gotta get him outta here.

314
00:34:58.221 --> 00:34:59.722
Sure thing.

315
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:02.016
I think we should shoot him right now.

316
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.728
Put a bullet right in his noggin.

317
00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:06.896
Do that...

318
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.731
everybody in this
shit-piss little town

319
00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:10.775
will be dead by morning.

320
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:19.492
22 robberies.

321
00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.704
Over $400,000 in losses.

322
00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:26.248
More in delays.

323
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:32.046
The Southern Pacific will have Ben Wade
convicted in a federal court.

324
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.883
Hanged in public.

325
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:38.177
An example made.

326
00:35:38.261 --> 00:35:40.846
And we will pay to make it happen.

327
00:35:40.931 --> 00:35:43.641
Y'all notice he didn't mention
any of the lives I've taken.

328
00:35:43.725 --> 00:35:45.392
I need three more men.

329
00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:46.769
You can have Tucker.

330
00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:47.853
Good.

331
00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:50.064
I'm coming.
You only need one.

332
00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:52.608
You're wounded, Mr. McElroy.

333
00:35:52.692 --> 00:35:55.986
I rode in here.
Sure as hell can ride out.

334
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.363
He goes, Potter's coming.

335
00:35:57.447 --> 00:35:58.948
What?

336
00:36:00.534 --> 00:36:02.368
Doc can't shoot shit.

337
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:04.912
I was best shot in my regiment.

338
00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.455
I'll come...

339
00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:11.293
for $200.

340
00:36:13.463 --> 00:36:15.172
You fight for the North or the South?

341
00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:18.592
North.

342
00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:20.511
We're Southern in name,

343
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:22.054
but Chicago owned.

344
00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:24.181
Fine. $200.

345
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.559
Let's go.

346
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:40.573
- Thank you.
- Thank me when it's done.

347
00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:50.374
What's goin' on?

348
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.986
This town's gonna burn!

349
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:26.035
- Let's get him, Mark!
- Cover me!

350
00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:30.789
Shoot!

351
00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:34.460
Get him!

352
00:37:36.379 --> 00:37:38.172
Get in the coach.

353
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.685
God damn it.

354
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:55.981
Evans, Crawley, Tucker,
you need to mount up now.

355
00:37:56.066 --> 00:37:57.691
Head for Evans Ranch.

356
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:59.401
I'll meet you there with the coach.

357
00:38:15.835 --> 00:38:18.045
How long does he have to be here?

358
00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.922
An hour...

359
00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:22.508
to make sure his outfit takes the bait.

360
00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:53.205
Hello, there!

361
00:38:53.289 --> 00:38:56.166
Evans! Can you give me a hand with this?

362
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:07.970
Whatever your wife's cooking in there,

363
00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:09.596
it smells good, Evans.

364
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.365
Let's go.

365
00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:32.953
Good driving, Marshal.

366
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.553
Remind me not to play poker
in this town.

367
00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:52.806
All right, Marshal.

368
00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:54.558
Give us a count.

369
00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:57.394
One, two, three.

370
00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:18.082
Good luck.

371
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:20.417
You're gonna check on my family
when you come back, right?

372
00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:21.502
First thing.

373
00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:22.586
Let's go.

374
00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:48.195
Ma'am.

375
00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:51.865
Byron...

376
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.742
what an unpleasant surprise.

377
00:40:56.246 --> 00:40:58.997
What happens if they
catch the wagon?

378
00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:00.082
Well...

379
00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:01.834
you saw where his man was.

380
00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:03.418
He's still gotta go fetch the outfit.

381
00:41:03.503 --> 00:41:04.837
Marshal's got a fast rig.

382
00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:07.005
They should reach
the fort before dawn.

383
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.217
His gang can't do anything
in front of the whole 6th Cavalry.

384
00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:27.234
Did you have something
to do with that?

385
00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:32.489
I hope you're proud of yourself.

386
00:41:35.577 --> 00:41:38.036
Just doin' my job, Doc.

387
00:41:40.957 --> 00:41:42.833
Thanks, son.

388
00:42:02.103 --> 00:42:03.937
We always wait to say grace.

389
00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:07.107
We don't presume to teach
other people manners.

390
00:42:07.192 --> 00:42:09.276
Aren't we supposed to say
grace for murderers, too?

391
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.653
Grace is for everyone, dear.

392
00:42:11.738 --> 00:42:13.697
- Then why don't we say it?
- Mark.

393
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.741
I'd like to hear it.

394
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.459
God our Father, Lord, and Savior,
thank You for Your love and favor.

395
00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:28.337
Please bless this drink
and food, we pray.

396
00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:31.423
Bless all who shares with us today.

397
00:42:31.507 --> 00:42:35.969
Amen.

398
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:39.139
If my pa wants to, he could shoot you dead.

399
00:42:39.224 --> 00:42:41.850
He can shoot a jackrabbit at 50 yards.

400
00:42:43.228 --> 00:42:44.686
Shooting an animal's a lot different

401
00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:46.939
than, uh, shooting a man, son.

402
00:42:47.023 --> 00:42:48.774
No, it isn't.

403
00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:52.778
Not in my opinion.

404
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.572
We could ask Byron here.

405
00:42:55.657 --> 00:42:59.201
Now, Byron, he's killed dozens of people:

406
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:02.204
Men and women and children,

407
00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:03.372
miners, Apache.

408
00:43:03.456 --> 00:43:06.750
Not a soul taken
didn't deserve what it got.

409
00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:13.548
Every way of man is right
in his own eyes, Byron.

410
00:43:13.633 --> 00:43:15.175
The Lord ponders the heart.

411
00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:19.513
Proverbs 21.

412
00:43:35.238 --> 00:43:36.238
Dan.

413
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.455
You eat more when you're
nervous, Mr. Butterfield?

414
00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:48.333
Oh, why, thank you, Dan.

415
00:43:48.418 --> 00:43:50.168
That would be pleasant
and kind of you.

416
00:43:50.253 --> 00:43:51.336
Much appreciated.

417
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:54.631
You can cut that up for me.

418
00:43:54.716 --> 00:43:56.174
Oh, can you cut the fat off there?

419
00:43:56.259 --> 00:43:57.801
I don't particularly like the fat at all.

420
00:43:57.885 --> 00:43:59.678
I just...

421
00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:03.390
And the...

422
00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:05.600
And the gristle.

423
00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:07.686
I don't like the gristle.

424
00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:15.902
You mind if I ask you how you got
that hitch in your step, Dan?

425
00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:18.322
Don't tell him nothing, Mr. Evans.

426
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:24.161
Where were you stationed?

427
00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:30.000
Second Company Sharpshooters
out of Lynnfield, Massachusetts.

428
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:38.842
My father was defending the U.S. Capitol
in the District of Columbia.

429
00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:39.968
Is that so?

430
00:44:40.053 --> 00:44:41.887
Well, Dan,

431
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:44.306
tell me the story
of how you lost your leg.

432
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:47.142
Did it get shot off, cut off?

433
00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:49.561
The Indians steal it?

434
00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:02.949
There's something moving
out there in the grass.

435
00:45:11.793 --> 00:45:13.710
There ain't nothing.

436
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:20.801
I think I saw something over the ridge.

437
00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:23.553
What if they caught
the coach already?

438
00:45:23.638 --> 00:45:25.972
What if they already know
it's Crawley inside?

439
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.896
You ever been to San Francisco?

440
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.817
If it's all right by you, Mr. Wade,

441
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:39.319
I'd rather we not talk.

442
00:45:39.404 --> 00:45:42.989
So you've never been to San Francisco.

443
00:45:43.074 --> 00:45:44.616
No.

444
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.080
I knew a girl there.

445
00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:52.833
She was the daughter
of a sea captain.

446
00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:56.920
She had the most
beautiful green eyes,

447
00:45:57.004 --> 00:45:59.965
about the greenest eyes I ever saw.

448
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:08.265
Like yours.

449
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:13.186
And I'd stare deep into them.

450
00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:15.439
They'd just change color in front of me.

451
00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:17.691
All the colors of the sea.

452
00:46:26.868 --> 00:46:28.910
What did you say your name was again?

453
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:30.912
Alice?

454
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:37.085
Alice.

455
00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:46.178
For God's sake.

456
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:48.138
He's killed more men
than the drought.

457
00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:50.223
He's not what I expected.
He's...

458
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:51.641
He's dangerous.

459
00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:53.852
Dangerous is what he is, Alice.

460
00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:56.396
I don't want you or the boys talking to him.

461
00:46:58.858 --> 00:47:01.318
You can change your mind, Dan.

462
00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:03.945
No one will think less of you.

463
00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:07.824
No one can think less of me.

464
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:11.661
Six months from now,

465
00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:14.122
everything's going to be green.

466
00:47:14.207 --> 00:47:16.500
The cows are going to be fat.

467
00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:21.588
We might even see the steam
from the train coming over the ridge.

468
00:47:22.298 --> 00:47:24.633
We'll be all right.

469
00:47:25.551 --> 00:47:28.345
But we won't make it
through the next six days

470
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:30.680
if I don't do this.

471
00:47:34.894 --> 00:47:36.311
Sorry, Dan.

472
00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:38.021
McElroy says five minutes.

473
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:52.369
You think he's too much for me?

474
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:56.998
He's a killer, Daniel.

475
00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:00.293
Then someone ought
to have the decency

476
00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:01.920
to bring him to justice.

477
00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:09.261
What are you thinking?

478
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.764
I'm not out there alone, you know.

479
00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:14.224
Have a little faith in me.

480
00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:17.310
Ben Wade has a gang,

481
00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:19.854
and they're out there tonight somewhere.

482
00:48:19.939 --> 00:48:23.441
If I don't go, we got
to pack up and leave,

483
00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:24.818
and God knows where,

484
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.194
without a prayer, dirt-poor.

485
00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:27.821
Now I'm tired, Alice.

486
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:30.824
I am tired of watching
my boys go hungry.

487
00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:32.993
I'm tired of the way
that they look at me.

488
00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:36.204
I'm tired of the way that you don't.

489
00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:39.874
I've been standing on one leg

490
00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:41.876
for three damn years,

491
00:48:41.961 --> 00:48:43.878
waiting for God to do me a favor.

492
00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.800
And He ain't listening.

493
00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:52.053
Mr. Evans.

494
00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.317
Oh, no, no, no, no.

495
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.028
This is my horse now.

496
00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:13.033
Come on over here.

497
00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:15.827
Come on.

498
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.959
Don't you be any trouble, Mark.

499
00:49:23.044 --> 00:49:24.836
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

500
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:29.591
William.

501
00:49:29.675 --> 00:49:31.217
I want to come with you.

502
00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:32.469
Well, you can't.

503
00:49:32.553 --> 00:49:33.720
I could help.

504
00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.138
You're 14 years old.

505
00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:37.349
Look, I can ride faster and shoot better

506
00:49:37.433 --> 00:49:38.975
than any one of them.

507
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.478
The Pinkerton's hurt,
Potter's no good,

508
00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:43.355
that railroad man's dead weight,

509
00:49:43.439 --> 00:49:44.606
and that other bastard...

510
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:45.732
William.

511
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.192
I don't have time to argue.

512
00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:49.986
I need you here.
That's that.

513
00:49:50.071 --> 00:49:51.613
That's that.

514
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.746
So, boys, where are we headed?

515
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.956
Ain't none of your business
where we're headed, Wade.

516
00:50:02.041 --> 00:50:03.667
You're a prisoner.

517
00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:06.795
You don't speak,
you don't piss,

518
00:50:06.879 --> 00:50:10.006
you don't goddamn breathe
unless we say so.

519
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:11.841
You understand that?

520
00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.514
We're taking you to Contention.

521
00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:20.934
Putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma
day after tomorrow.

522
00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:22.852
You shouldn't have told him that.

523
00:50:24.397 --> 00:50:26.022
Relax, friend.

524
00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:28.858
Now if we get separated,
I know where to meet up.

525
00:50:32.446 --> 00:50:35.156
I'd like to thank you
for your hospitality, ma'am.

526
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:37.992
Hope I can send
your husband back all right.

527
00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:15.196
What did Ben Wade mean
about sending Pa back all right?

528
00:51:15.281 --> 00:51:17.240
Was he saying he was gonna kill him?

529
00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:19.492
Ben Wade don't have to lift a finger.

530
00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:21.953
His gang will do it for him.

531
00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:27.083
Your father can take care of himself.

532
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.255
So...

533
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.550
were you conscripted
into Lincoln's army, Mr. Evans,

534
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.010
or did you volunteer?

535
00:52:19.094 --> 00:52:20.553
Neither.

536
00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:24.140
Maybe both.

537
00:52:24.225 --> 00:52:26.684
What does that mean?

538
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:28.853
Means I was a volunteer

539
00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:30.897
in the Massachusetts State Guard.

540
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:33.066
Then, in '62,

541
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.360
the federal government
was running low on men,

542
00:52:35.444 --> 00:52:37.487
so they called in the state militias

543
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:39.823
to protect Washington.

544
00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:41.991
And that's when you got hurt.

545
00:52:45.955 --> 00:52:48.748
What are you doing out here, Dan?

546
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:52.085
You got a family to protect.

547
00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:53.545
You're not a lawman.

548
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:55.004
You don't work for the railroad

549
00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:57.173
like Mr. Shiny Shoes over there.

550
00:52:57.258 --> 00:52:58.925
You're not a Pinkerton.

551
00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:03.805
Maybe I don't like the idea
of men like you on the loose.

552
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.642
It's man's nature
to take what he wants, Dan.

553
00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:09.769
That's how we're born.

554
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.065
Well, I make an honest living.

555
00:53:14.149 --> 00:53:17.777
It might be honest,
but I don't think it's much of a living.

556
00:53:17.862 --> 00:53:20.405
You must be hurting bad
for money to take this job.

557
00:53:22.741 --> 00:53:24.492
Go to sleep.

558
00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:31.457
I imagine debt puts
a lot of pressure on a marriage.

559
00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:33.459
You imagine?

560
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:36.462
What would you know about marriage?

561
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:40.008
We can't all be cutthroats and thieves.

562
00:53:40.092 --> 00:53:43.136
I know if I was lucky enough
to have a wife like Alice,

563
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.763
I'd treat her a whole lot
better than you do, Dan.

564
00:53:45.848 --> 00:53:49.100
I'd feed her better,
buy her pretty dresses,

565
00:53:49.184 --> 00:53:51.895
wouldn't make her work so hard.

566
00:53:53.772 --> 00:53:56.983
Yeah, I'll bet Alice was a real pretty girl
before she married you.

567
00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.193
Shut up about my wife.

568
00:53:59.278 --> 00:54:00.945
You shut up about her.

569
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.196
You say one more word,

570
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.158
and I'll cut you down right here.

571
00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:06.492
Right here.

572
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.246
I like this side of you, Dan.

573
00:54:10.331 --> 00:54:12.248
Mr. Evans.

574
00:54:15.961 --> 00:54:17.211
Okay.

575
00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.466
It's my watch now.

576
00:54:54.416 --> 00:54:57.293
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'

577
00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:00.838
Before the night is done

578
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:05.009
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'

579
00:55:05.094 --> 00:55:08.179
I'll never see the sun

580
00:55:08.263 --> 00:55:11.808
I suppose it's too much
to ask for a little quiet.

581
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.061
The way I figured it

582
00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.480
is I'd be asleep
in my own bed right now

583
00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:19.607
if it weren't for you.

584
00:55:19.692 --> 00:55:21.317
So if I got to be up,

585
00:55:21.402 --> 00:55:24.821
well, then, you're damn well
gonna be up with me, too,

586
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:27.657
Ben Wade.

587
00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:35.206
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'

588
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.001
Before the night is done

589
00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:42.088
Hang me in the mornin'

590
00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:46.342
I'll never see the sun

591
00:56:00.024 --> 00:56:02.358
Son of a bitch!

592
00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.333
Enough.

593
00:56:23.297 --> 00:56:24.547
Enough!

594
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:26.340
That's enough, McElroy.

595
00:56:38.812 --> 00:56:40.688
We have to bury him.

596
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:45.526
Take the time to dig one grave,

597
00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:48.279
might as well dig one for yourself.

598
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.575
Let's go.

599
00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:54.077
Mount up.

600
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:58.873
Gonna hang me in the mornin'

601
00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:07.048
I'll never see the sun

602
00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:23.708
Don't you worry there, Boss.

603
00:58:23.792 --> 00:58:25.710
We're gonna get you
outta there in a second.

604
00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:31.924
Charlie!

605
00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:41.517
Wait! Wait!

606
00:58:45.189 --> 00:58:46.439
Sutherland.

607
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:51.527
Jackson.

608
00:58:55.490 --> 00:59:01.245
No.

609
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:08.044
Don't do this.

610
00:59:08.921 --> 00:59:11.047
- Where is he?
- Open the door.

611
00:59:11.131 --> 00:59:12.882
Open the door.
Let me outta here, God damn it.

612
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:15.760
- Where did they take him?
- I don't know.

613
00:59:19.223 --> 00:59:21.766
Mister...

614
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.017
you better tell me...

615
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:25.519
where they took him...

616
00:59:25.604 --> 00:59:27.021
or you will burn.

617
00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:34.528
Contention.
All right?

618
00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:37.240
They're going to Contention.

619
00:59:37.324 --> 00:59:40.576
They're gonna put him
on the 3:10 to Yuma Prison tomorrow.

620
00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:46.582
Let me outta here!

621
00:59:49.795 --> 00:59:52.380
Contention is...

622
00:59:52.464 --> 00:59:55.466
80 miles back the other way.

623
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.885
We'd have to about kill our horses.

624
00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.262
So we'll buy new ones.

625
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:00.638
Charlie...

626
01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.932
it's his own fault he got caught.

627
01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.517
He made a mistake.

628
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:09.146
You think you could do
a better job leading this crew?

629
01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:10.231
Maybe.

630
01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:19.615
You forgotten what he done for us.

631
01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.374
We're going to Contention.

632
01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.388
Can't say I didn't warn you.

633
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.018
There's a shortcut we could take.

634
01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.353
Shortcut?

635
01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:50.896
Through the pass.

636
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.356
Takes you right through to Contention.

637
01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:54.358
Why didn't you say something before?

638
01:00:54.443 --> 01:00:56.652
That's Apache country.

639
01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.654
I thought the government gave them land.

640
01:00:58.739 --> 01:00:59.947
These are the ones refused to go.

641
01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:01.574
I wouldn't take that pass.

642
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.326
Oh, you'd like us to take the long way?

643
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.745
- That's right.
- And let your boys catch us?

644
01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:11.459
Mr. Butterfield, the Apache
that live in that pass

645
01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:13.002
are the ones that stayed to fight.

646
01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.087
They enjoy killing.

647
01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.673
You ain't gonna make it.

648
01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:23.137
We'll take our chances.

649
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.626
Something on your mind, Dan?

650
01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:57.421
Why'd you kill Tucker?

651
01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.256
Why not me?

652
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.008
Or Butterfield?

653
01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:03.010
Well, Tucker took my horse.

654
01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:07.264
Did you like him, Dan?

655
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:09.392
No.

656
01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.310
He told me he burnt down your barn.

657
01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:14.271
He was an asshole...

658
01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:17.733
but wishing him dead and killing him

659
01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:19.902
are two different things.

660
01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:21.904
Your conscience is sensitive, Dan.

661
01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.948
I don't think it's my favorite part of you.

662
01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.326
Button it up, Mr. Wade.

663
01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:31.247
You wanna talk to somebody,
talk to me.

664
01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.665
I don't like talking to you, Byron.

665
01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.375
Not when I have the gun.

666
01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:35.751
No, that ain't it.

667
01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.087
I just don't find you that interesting.

668
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.631
Laugh it up, Doc,

669
01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.633
till he guts you like a fish.

670
01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.885
Byron's like a song with one note.

671
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.762
You ever read another book
in your life, Byron,

672
01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:48.055
besides the Bible?

673
01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.765
No need.

674
01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:52.977
Byron acts pious.

675
01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:56.564
Few years ago, when he was
under contract to Central,

676
01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:59.400
I seen him and a bunch of other Pinks

677
01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:02.153
mow down 32 Apache
women and children.

678
01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:04.029
Renegades...

679
01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.449
gunning down railroad men
and their families.

680
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.826
Picking 'em off the road one by one.

681
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.077
Scalping 'em.

682
01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:12.455
There was young ones running
around crying and screaming.

683
01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.166
No more than three years old.

684
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.169
And his boys shot 'em all
then pushed 'em into a ditch.

685
01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:19.879
Some of them was still crying.

686
01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:25.384
But I guess Byron figured
that Jesus wouldn't mind.

687
01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.680
Apparently Jesus don't like the Apache.

688
01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:34.059
Keep on talking...

689
01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:35.644
all the way to Yuma,

690
01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.480
right up them steps,

691
01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:38.939
to the rope,

692
01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:40.357
straight to Hell.

693
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.903
Day I die, Byron,

694
01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.738
I'm getting sprung from Hell.

695
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.072
I might feel the same,

696
01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.532
if I come from the seed

697
01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.743
of a drunk gravedigger

698
01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.204
and the rancid womb of a whore.

699
01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:07.384
Drop it, Dan Evans.

700
01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:08.761
Drop it.

701
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.222
Toss that to the ground, Doc.

702
01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:13.140
Mr. Butterfield.

703
01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:18.354
Now I believe, Dan,

704
01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:20.189
you're carrying a pistol as well.

705
01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.774
I'd appreciate it if you take that out

706
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:24.109
and drop it on the ground.
Thank you.

707
01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.034
Now, I always liked you, Byron.

708
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.287
But you never knew
when to shut up.

709
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.585
Even bad men love their mamas.

710
01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:50.427
Now I think it's time
for everybody to go home.

711
01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:52.596
Don't you move, Mr. Wade.

712
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:55.307
Let go of that shotgun.

713
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.892
William...

714
01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:58.769
what the hell
are you doing here?

715
01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.938
Now, I don't think
you gonna shoot a man

716
01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.690
you admire in the back
of the head, boy.

717
01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.945
Dan, tell your boy it's over.

718
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:11.323
You think you can keep
your gun on him, William?

719
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:14.076
I'm doing a damn sight
better than you did.

720
01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.958
You ever been to Dodge City?

721
01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.130
No.

722
01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:11.800
Stop talking to him.

723
01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:16.972
The way you're shuffling those cards,

724
01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:18.932
I took you for a pro.

725
01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.393
I practice a lot.

726
01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.562
I can tell.

727
01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.196
You ever been to Dodge?

728
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.322
Yes, indeed.

729
01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:36.909
Meanest, most beautiful
dirty city there ever was.

730
01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.161
Saloon was just overflowing

731
01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.871
with cattle drivers, and road agents,

732
01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.456
prospectors, gunslingers,

733
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.249
gamblers, and women.

734
01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:50.214
Women who'll do things to you
you'll never forget.

735
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.342
They'll give you a disease you'll never forget.

736
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.010
Money in your pocket in Dodge City,

737
01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:57.513
you can have everything
a man ever wished for.

738
01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.558
Everything a man comes to need.

739
01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:08.941
I got there on my own as a boy
not much bigger than you.

740
01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.985
And how many men
you killed since then, Wade?

741
01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:16.740
How many families you destroyed?

742
01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:22.788
Quite a few.

743
01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:26.917
Is it true that you dynamited

744
01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:31.296
a wagon full of prospectors
in the Western Territories last spring?

745
01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.881
No, that's a lie.

746
01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:35.175
It was a train full.

747
01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.603
Well, Dan...

748
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.441
I gotta take a piss.

749
01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.611
You know, I thought
he was gonna shoot me

750
01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:55.946
back at the ravine.

751
01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:58.949
I really thought
he was gonna do it.

752
01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.951
You know, there's
a wildness in his eyes.

753
01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:03.370
- It reminds me of...
- He's gonna be nothing like you, Wade.

754
01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:12.212
William's got a head start
on the path of decency.

755
01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.008
Yeah, that's why I don't mess around

756
01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:17.968
with doing anything good, Dan.

757
01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:25.309
You do one good deed
for somebody...

758
01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.352
I imagine it's habit-forming.

759
01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:31.106
Something decent.

760
01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:33.108
See that grateful look in their eyes,

761
01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.152
imagine it makes you feel
like Christ Hisself.

762
01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:37.404
All right, I had enough
of this, Wade.

763
01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:39.156
Come on, let's go.

764
01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:08.977
William!

765
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.962
- There's three of 'em.
- Yours?

766
01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:37.172
If they were mine, you'd be dead.

767
01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.135
Give me that gun, Wade.

768
01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.222
Wade?

769
01:09:45.306 --> 01:09:46.348
Wade!

770
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.897
I told you not to come this way.

771
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:36.440
It was McElroy's decision.

772
01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:39.109
I told you there'd be trouble.

773
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.116
Give me the keys to the handcuffs.

774
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.642
Easy...

775
01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:14.269
Easy now.

776
01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:16.355
Where is he?

777
01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.815
He's gone.

778
01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:24.571
He took the horses with him.
I found this in the grass.

779
01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.912
What's the quickest way
out of the pass?

780
01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:35.832
He'll be looking for help getting his cuffs off.

781
01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:39.628
We're going after him?

782
01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.088
Well, there ain't no reward

783
01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:43.256
for getting him halfway
to that train, is there?

784
01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.540
I got to be honest with y'all.

785
01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.500
I like some of their food.

786
01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:02.919
As for wanting $40 a month, now,

787
01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:04.838
like them Irish up north...

788
01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:08.508
Goddamn Coolies.

789
01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.219
They'll work just fine
with my left boot up their ass.

790
01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.764
Well, if could teach
a monkey to lay track...

791
01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:16.391
Well, what we need
is some Negroes

792
01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:18.560
brung in here, Mr. Boles.

793
01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.354
Show these Chinamen
what real work is.

794
01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:30.572
Holy Christ.

795
01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.410
- Who's that?
- That's him.

796
01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:40.665
You, help me with the handcuffs.

797
01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.294
Break the chain.

798
01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:47.089
Use the hammer.
Break the chain.

799
01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:52.844
I got five guns on you
out here, Ben Wade!

800
01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.471
Best come on out!

801
01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:14.783
Our horses.

802
01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.016
What in the hell's going on here?

803
01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:45.063
Mr. Butterfield, all finished in Bisbee?

804
01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.232
Mr. Boles.

805
01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:58.535
Better hurry. We're making the last blasts
through the mountains this week.

806
01:14:58.619 --> 01:14:59.870
That's my prisoner.

807
01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.914
I'm taking him to Contention,
putting him on the prison train to Yuma.

808
01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.209
What prisoner?

809
01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:08.128
Come now, Mr. Boles,

810
01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:09.671
that's Ben Wade you have there.

811
01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:13.091
Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother

812
01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:14.551
in front of me

813
01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.053
six years ago in Abilene.

814
01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:19.723
Your brother was a lyin', bilkin' card sharp.

815
01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.021
That is, if he's the asshole I remember.

816
01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.857
Could, of course, been some other
asshole I killed that I forgot about.

817
01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.582
You can't do that.
That's immoral.

818
01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.921
Moral ain't got a damn thing to do with it.

819
01:15:56.344 --> 01:15:59.763
I was expecting to collect
a $200 reward for that man.

820
01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:03.808
I'm delivering him to Contention.

821
01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.644
I need that money.

822
01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.812
Need it bad enough to die?

823
01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:21.493
Well, at least let us take our horses.

824
01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.787
I got no problem with that...

825
01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:26.414
as long as you ride away, mister.

826
01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.541
Nice knowing you, Dan.

827
01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:12.627
Did you see me get that one
with the shovel?

828
01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.046
Doc.

829
01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:16.214
Doc!

830
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.729
Dan!

831
01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.291
God damn it!

832
01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:08.850
Did we make it?

833
01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:11.019
Did we get away?

834
01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:12.145
Yeah, Doc.

835
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.522
We did.

836
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:16.691
Thanks to you.

837
01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:43.885
We need a place to lay low.

838
01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.262
Keep him outta sight
till the train comes.

839
01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:49.891
There's a hotel up here.

840
01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.726
I'll check us in.
You ride around back.

841
01:18:51.811 --> 01:18:53.645
All right.
Follow me.

842
01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:00.360
Hello, gentlemen.

843
01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:04.280
Hey, William, you go keep
a watch at the railhead.

844
01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.782
If you see them coming...

845
01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.367
I'll let you know.

846
01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:09.661
And William?

847
01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.806
There's a Can-Can on the hour
if you're interested.

848
01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.994
It's the bridal suite.

849
01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:53.079
Hope you don't mind.
It's all they had.

850
01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.179
Well, well.

851
01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:12.807
That looks like rain clouds over Bisbee.

852
01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:15.977
You still need that $200, Dan?

853
01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:17.562
Shut up.

854
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.735
Mr. Evans, you continue
to give me great confidence.

855
01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.945
Well, it ain't 3:10 yet.

856
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:28.072
I'm gonna go see about the marshal.

857
01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:33.828
Come on, move.
Let's go.

858
01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:49.677
We're looking for a group escorting an outlaw

859
01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.596
by the name of Ben Wade.

860
01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.098
Yeah, we been chasing him
through these tunnels.

861
01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:01.356
Who are you?

862
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.690
What's it to you?

863
01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.444
Ben Wade killed my brother.

864
01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:08.863
Then your brother must be famous.

865
01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:14.827
You boys some kind of posse?

866
01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:29.634
I hate posses.

867
01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:40.687
So this is the bridal suite.

868
01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.314
Now, I wonder how many brides

869
01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:44.566
have taken in this view.

870
01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:51.072
What are you gonna do
with your $200 now, Dan?

871
01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:52.448
Now that the rains are coming?

872
01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:55.827
I owe people money, Wade.

873
01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.870
That drought left me in the hole.

874
01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.792
Well, what do you think
about double that amount?

875
01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:06.462
You could pay your debts,

876
01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:09.048
buy a hundred more cows,

877
01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.633
build a new barn.

878
01:22:10.718 --> 01:22:12.635
How you reckon
I'm gonna do that?

879
01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.181
Just lay down your gun
and let me walk out the door.

880
01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:18.975
It's worth $400 to me.

881
01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.645
Is that what you reckon my price is?

882
01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:25.481
No.

883
01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:29.694
No, I reckon it's a thousand.

884
01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.946
$1,000.

885
01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:34.449
Now, there's 10 times that amount
in Butterfield's coach.

886
01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:35.575
Oh, yeah?

887
01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:37.327
You want my cut, Dan?

888
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:39.078
It's all yours.

889
01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:42.540
Isn't that kind of reckless of you, Wade?

890
01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.250
Seeing as, uh...

891
01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:45.835
you're so sure that, uh,

892
01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:48.129
your crew's coming to get you?

893
01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.632
Oh, they're coming, Dan.

894
01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.802
Sure as God's vengeance,
they're coming.

895
01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.349
But I just like to do things easy.

896
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:05.021
Imagine what you could do
with a thousand dollars, Dan.

897
01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:06.522
You could hire
a couple of ranch hands.

898
01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.608
Your boys could go to school,
grow up smart.

899
01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:12.236
What about Alice?

900
01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:15.907
She would be the proud wife
of a bona fide Arizona rancher.

901
01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:21.621
All you got to do is say yes.

902
01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:28.252
Well...

903
01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:31.255
would you give me a bank note, Wade?

904
01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.926
Or maybe you'd be kind enough
to make a deposit for me.

905
01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.386
Cash.

906
01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:42.809
Well, you... you tell me, Wade.

907
01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:45.812
How would I account for...

908
01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:48.523
for that amount of money?

909
01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:51.859
And what would I tell people
when I spend it?

910
01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.778
That, uh...

911
01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.196
That you got the jump on me,

912
01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.242
you escaped, and somehow I got a fortune?

913
01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:04.080
No. How dumb do you think people are?

914
01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:07.166
Nobody needs to know.

915
01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:11.963
You know what?

916
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.923
Would you do me a favor?

917
01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.968
Don't talk to me for a while.

918
01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:19.345
You mean we're still not friends?

919
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:20.972
No.

920
01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:25.143
No, we're not.

921
01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.103
Come five minutes to three,

922
01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:29.772
we're gonna be a hell
of a lot closer than you think.

923
01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:41.242
They're gonna hang me

924
01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.286
In the mornin'

925
01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.956
Before the night is done

926
01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:51.419
They're gonna hang me

927
01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.463
In the mornin'

928
01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:57.717
I'll never see the sun

929
01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:14.484
Who is it?

930
01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.277
It's me, Dan.

931
01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:18.279
I brought help.

932
01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:21.657
You been gone a long time,
Mr. Butterfield.

933
01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:25.870
How do I know somebody
ain't got a gun on you out there?

934
01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:43.596
Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane.

935
01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.848
- Marshal.
- Mr. Evans.

936
01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:51.854
Two of my finest men:
Harvey Pell...

937
01:25:54.233 --> 01:25:55.983
Sam Fuller.

938
01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:57.985
I'm sorry about all that, Marshal.

939
01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.112
- I really am grateful for the help.
- Don't mention it.

940
01:26:00.197 --> 01:26:02.949
So you fellas really gonna
help put me on this train?

941
01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:07.954
It may not seem like it, Mr. Wade,

942
01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:10.414
but we got law and order in this town,
just like any other.

943
01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:12.959
Well, that's very reassuring, Marshal.

944
01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:15.837
How much is Butterfield paying you?

945
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:17.922
That's none of your business.

946
01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:20.341
You gonna come with us?

947
01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:22.927
Oh, I'll be walking with you...

948
01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.179
every step of the way.

949
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.307
You have my word on that, Dan.

950
01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:30.977
So there's five of us.
Five is good.

951
01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.439
It ain't enough.

952
01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:38.651
It ain't nearly enough.

953
01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.010
- Pa!
- That's my boy.

954
01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.139
They're coming.

955
01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:11.767
They're coming this way.
I seen 'em.

956
01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:14.478
- Where?
- About a mile out. Same way we come.

957
01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:17.148
- How many are there?
- Seven. Eight.

958
01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:18.816
Which is it, boy?
Seven or eight?

959
01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:22.904
Seven.

960
01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:35.833
Folks, sorry to bother you,

961
01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:37.793
but I'm gonna need you all
to move outside

962
01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.086
as quickly as possible.

963
01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:40.588
That's it, folks.

964
01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:42.173
Thank you very much.

965
01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:43.841
That's it.
Move along, folks.

966
01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:44.967
Move along.

967
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.429
Come on, now!

968
01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:49.847
Hey! Get out of my way!

969
01:27:52.059 --> 01:27:53.392
Right there.

970
01:28:12.079 --> 01:28:13.704
There sure are a lot of 'em.

971
01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:16.958
I didn't figure on it
being the whole gang.

972
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.150
Boss.

973
01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:45.319
Boss?

974
01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:48.823
Boss, you in there?

975
01:28:50.117 --> 01:28:52.785
What do you want me to tell him?

976
01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:55.746
You tell him you'll write him
a letter every day from Yuma.

977
01:29:03.797 --> 01:29:06.090
You be careful, Wade.

978
01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:12.972
Charlie. Boys.

979
01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:14.974
- Hey, Boss.
- Yeah?

980
01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.475
Charlie, why don't you take the boys

981
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.394
down to the saloon
and buy 'em a drink.

982
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.523
You okay?

983
01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:26.193
Oh, I'm fine. I'm just sittin' up here
with my four new friends.

984
01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:27.278
Hey...

985
01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.364
That's enough.

986
01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:37.705
Thank you, Charlie. Boys.

987
01:29:56.808 --> 01:30:00.519
Listen up!

988
01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:05.483
That's Ben Wade
they have up there.

989
01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.485
Ben... Wade!

990
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.200
Now...

991
01:30:14.284 --> 01:30:17.745
the Railroad intends...

992
01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:23.417
to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma...

993
01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:25.252
and hang him.

994
01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:26.754
What's he doing?

995
01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:37.973
We will give you 200 cash dollars

996
01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:41.769
to any man who shoots
any one of his captors.

997
01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:42.853
How much?

998
01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:49.151
200 cash dollars guaranteed!

999
01:30:53.573 --> 01:30:56.617
$200 guaranteed!

1000
01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.247
- Right here. You got me.
- Hand it over.

1001
01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:02.498
I'll tell you now, mister.

1002
01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:04.291
I'll take 200.
Give me the money.

1003
01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:05.709
Well, you gotta shoot 'em first.

1004
01:31:12.384 --> 01:31:15.010
There's gotta be 30, 40
more guns out there now.

1005
01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:18.764
Oh, to hell with this.

1006
01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:23.144
- Now just a minute, Marshal.
- Look, look.

1007
01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:24.520
If it's a fair fight, well, sure.

1008
01:31:24.604 --> 01:31:26.397
I'd stay for that.

1009
01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:27.481
A fair fight, that...

1010
01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:32.319
That's a man's duty, but...

1011
01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:34.363
there's only five of us.

1012
01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:37.449
I'm sorry, mister,

1013
01:31:37.534 --> 01:31:39.785
but I'm not gonna die here today.

1014
01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:44.498
And neither are my men.

1015
01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:45.791
Marshal...

1016
01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:50.045
forgot this.

1017
01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:57.261
Marshal...

1018
01:31:57.929 --> 01:32:00.347
Marshal!
Marshal, what's the...

1019
01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.895
Now, you see, Dan...

1020
01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:10.858
generally, pretty much
everyone wants to live.

1021
01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:13.736
- I'll double your money.
- Let's go, boys.

1022
01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.780
Please. Do you wanna see us
shot down in the street?

1023
01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:18.365
This thing happened in Bisbee.

1024
01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:20.242
That means Butterfield, too.

1025
01:32:20.327 --> 01:32:21.911
Why bring your troubles to Contention?

1026
01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:24.830
We've got families.
Every one of us is a family man.

1027
01:32:24.915 --> 01:32:26.498
I'm a family man, too.

1028
01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:29.418
He's gonna walk out on you.

1029
01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:33.130
Then you best get out
like the rest of us.

1030
01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:40.304
He's gonna come back up here,

1031
01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:42.348
and he's gonna walk out on you.

1032
01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:45.768
Now what you gotta figure
is why you and your boy

1033
01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:48.145
are gonna die.

1034
01:32:51.107 --> 01:32:53.734
Because Butterfield's railroad
lost some money?

1035
01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:25.724
Is that all of 'em?

1036
01:33:25.809 --> 01:33:27.476
- Get inside!
- Get a doctor!

1037
01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.438
Almost.

1038
01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:35.484
Your move, General.

1039
01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:41.991
What do you expect him to say?

1040
01:33:42.075 --> 01:33:44.076
I expect him to say something
that makes sense.

1041
01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:46.954
Something that might
save the two of you.

1042
01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:48.205
Take a look, Dan.

1043
01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:51.583
What's the matter?
You don't wanna see?

1044
01:33:51.668 --> 01:33:54.086
I'll see 'em soon enough.

1045
01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:55.629
What about you, kid?
You wanna look?

1046
01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:57.381
You stay away from
the window, William.

1047
01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.134
Go on, take a look.

1048
01:34:00.218 --> 01:34:02.553
Animals, all of 'em.

1049
01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:05.556
Campos, stand guard.
Jackson, back door.

1050
01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:09.935
They're gonna kill you
and your father, William.

1051
01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:15.941
They're gonna laugh while they do it.

1052
01:34:16.026 --> 01:34:17.234
I think you know that.

1053
01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:19.153
Call 'em off.

1054
01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:22.656
Why should I?

1055
01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:24.575
Because you're not all bad.

1056
01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:30.998
Yes, I am.

1057
01:34:31.082 --> 01:34:32.416
You saved us from those Indians.

1058
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.168
I saved myself.

1059
01:34:34.252 --> 01:34:35.336
You got us through the tunnels.

1060
01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.920
You helped us get away.

1061
01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:39.965
If I'd had a gun in them tunnels,

1062
01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:42.009
I would have used it on you.

1063
01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:47.139
I don't believe you.

1064
01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:51.018
Kid, I wouldn't last five minutes
leading an outfit like that

1065
01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:52.686
if I wasn't as rotten as hell.

1066
01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:14.708
Dan?

1067
01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:25.552
I can't do it, Dan.

1068
01:35:25.637 --> 01:35:28.347
And if I can't do it,
you shouldn't do it, either.

1069
01:35:29.766 --> 01:35:32.601
They say discretion
is the better part of valor.

1070
01:35:32.685 --> 01:35:34.478
If you think you have
an obligation to me

1071
01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.188
or to the Railroad,

1072
01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:39.400
I assure you, you do not.
I'm releasing you.

1073
01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:41.485
It's just you left, Dan.

1074
01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.404
Just you and your boy.

1075
01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:46.365
Maybe he's right, Pa.
Maybe we should go home.

1076
01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:58.377
Well, what did Doc Potter
give his life for, William?

1077
01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.795
And McElroy?

1078
01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:01.880
Little red ants on a hill.

1079
01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:04.466
I'll pay you the 200, Dan, right now,

1080
01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:05.676
and you can walk away.

1081
01:36:11.057 --> 01:36:13.517
You know, this whole ride,

1082
01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:15.394
that's been nagging on me.

1083
01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:20.107
That's what the government
gave me for my leg.

1084
01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:23.652
$198.36.

1085
01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:26.238
And the funny thing is that...

1086
01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:29.741
when you think about it,
which I have been lately,

1087
01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:32.953
was they weren't paying me
to walk away.

1088
01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:36.790
They were paying me
so they could walk away.

1089
01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:40.961
Don't muddy the past
and the present, Dan.

1090
01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:42.171
No, no, no, Wade.

1091
01:36:42.255 --> 01:36:45.132
I'm seeing the world the way it is.

1092
01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:48.177
If you take him to the train, Pa,
I'm going with you.

1093
01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:51.722
No, Mr. Butterfield's
gonna take you home.

1094
01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:53.807
- No, I'm not going anywhere with him.
- Yes, you are.

1095
01:36:53.892 --> 01:36:55.809
I'm staying here with you.

1096
01:36:55.894 --> 01:36:58.437
You're gonna hold up
in a room across the hall.

1097
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.189
You're gonna wait until we leave.

1098
01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:02.566
I'll get him to Bisbee, Dan.
I promise you.

1099
01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:05.402
Oh, you're gonna promise me
a lot more than that, Butterfield.

1100
01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:08.947
I want guarantees that Hollander

1101
01:37:09.032 --> 01:37:10.699
and his boys

1102
01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:13.952
will never set foot
on my land again,

1103
01:37:14.037 --> 01:37:15.412
and that my water's gonna flow.

1104
01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:20.083
And I expect you to hand my wife
1,000 cash dollars when you see her.

1105
01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:21.793
You got money to spare.

1106
01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:24.129
I can deliver that.

1107
01:37:24.214 --> 01:37:25.714
Just get him on the train.

1108
01:37:27.884 --> 01:37:28.884
You heard him?

1109
01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:31.011
I heard him.

1110
01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:37.351
William, I want you
to give this back to your mother.

1111
01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:44.691
I want you to tell her that it helped me
find what was right.

1112
01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:49.571
Pa...

1113
01:37:51.282 --> 01:37:53.325
I can't.

1114
01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:54.785
I can't just leave you.

1115
01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:57.579
I'm gonna be a day
behind you, William.

1116
01:37:58.665 --> 01:38:00.332
Unless something happens,
and if it does,

1117
01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:03.377
I need a man at the ranch
to run things,

1118
01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.546
protect our family, and I know
that you can do that

1119
01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:08.382
because you've become
a fine man, William.

1120
01:38:08.466 --> 01:38:10.926
You've become a fine man.
You got all the best parts of me.

1121
01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:13.512
What few there are.

1122
01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:22.354
And you just remember
that your old man

1123
01:38:22.438 --> 01:38:24.189
walked Ben Wade to that station

1124
01:38:24.274 --> 01:38:26.650
when nobody else would.

1125
01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:25.459
You know, squeezing that watch
won't stop time.

1126
01:39:32.592 --> 01:39:35.636
Don't get so scared.
You might back a bad move.

1127
01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:45.354
You ever read the Bible, Dan?

1128
01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:50.067
I read it one time.

1129
01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:51.777
I was eight years old.

1130
01:39:53.112 --> 01:39:55.572
My daddy just got hisself
killed over a shot of whiskey,

1131
01:39:55.657 --> 01:39:58.116
and my mama said,
"We're going back East to start over."

1132
01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:02.579
So she gave me a Bible,

1133
01:40:02.664 --> 01:40:04.873
sat me down in the train station,
told me to read it.

1134
01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:10.379
She was gonna get our tickets.

1135
01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:15.592
Well, I did what she said.

1136
01:40:15.677 --> 01:40:17.928
I read that Bible
from cover to cover.

1137
01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:19.638
It took me three days.

1138
01:40:22.767 --> 01:40:24.184
She never came back.

1139
01:40:50.795 --> 01:40:52.170
It's time.

1140
01:41:09.105 --> 01:41:11.773
It's a half mile
to the station from here, Dan.

1141
01:41:15.403 --> 01:41:16.737
I guess we're walking.

1142
01:41:38.301 --> 01:41:39.509
There he is!

1143
01:41:45.433 --> 01:41:47.517
Go and flush him out!

1144
01:41:50.521 --> 01:41:52.355
Let's get to it.

1145
01:41:55.318 --> 01:41:56.526
Lucky.

1146
01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:01.156
Dan.

1147
01:42:04.076 --> 01:42:05.577
Thanks.

1148
01:42:05.661 --> 01:42:06.745
Move.

1149
01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:32.562
Come on!

1150
01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:37.067
Might not get a chance
to use those Scofields, Charlie.

1151
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:42.155
Perhaps you can explain to me
the next portion of your plan, Dan.

1152
01:43:00.174 --> 01:43:01.591
I think I got him!

1153
01:43:06.806 --> 01:43:09.099
Hey.
Hey!

1154
01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.059
Not the black hat!

1155
01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:12.602
The rancher,
you dumb-shits!

1156
01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:15.438
The rancher!
The ranch...

1157
01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:28.326
Charlie!

1158
01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:33.415
Get back! Get back!

1159
01:43:39.714 --> 01:43:41.047
Boss.

1160
01:43:41.757 --> 01:43:42.799
Boss!

1161
01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:46.970
Let's go.

1162
01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.471
The white door.
Move it!

1163
01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:10.827
All right.

1164
01:44:12.413 --> 01:44:13.788
I ain't doing this
no more, Dan.

1165
01:44:18.628 --> 01:44:20.170
I'm getting you
on that train, Wade.

1166
01:44:20.254 --> 01:44:22.380
Your son went back!

1167
01:44:22.465 --> 01:44:23.965
The boy's gone, hero.

1168
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:26.468
Ain't nobody watching no more.

1169
01:44:26.552 --> 01:44:27.761
You still got that one good leg.

1170
01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:30.347
Why don't you use it
to get on home?

1171
01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:32.766
Charlie!

1172
01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:34.601
Charlie Prince!

1173
01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:35.685
Yeah, Boss!

1174
01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:37.187
Hold your fire.

1175
01:44:37.271 --> 01:44:39.481
- I'm walking out.
- Hold your fire!

1176
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:07.133
I ain't never been no hero, Wade.

1177
01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:13.014
The only battle I seen,
we was in retreat.

1178
01:45:13.099 --> 01:45:15.558
My foot got shot off
by one of my own men.

1179
01:45:17.561 --> 01:45:21.106
You try telling that story to your boy.

1180
01:45:21.190 --> 01:45:23.400
See how he looks at you then.

1181
01:45:37.415 --> 01:45:40.500
Boss! Boss!

1182
01:45:44.213 --> 01:45:45.380
Okay, Dan.

1183
01:45:56.267 --> 01:45:57.434
Son.

1184
01:46:00.146 --> 01:46:03.648
They're on the roofs!

1185
01:46:04.692 --> 01:46:05.859
Boss!

1186
01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:36.806
Boss! Drop!

1187
01:46:41.812 --> 01:46:43.188
- Can you make this?
- Yeah.

1188
01:46:55.618 --> 01:46:56.743
Come on.

1189
01:46:56.827 --> 01:46:58.745
Come on!

1190
01:47:17.681 --> 01:47:19.849
Go! Run!

1191
01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:49.546
Spread out!

1192
01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:03.560
What time is it?

1193
01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:06.604
About 10 past 3.

1194
01:48:06.689 --> 01:48:08.648
Where's the 3:10 to Yuma?

1195
01:48:08.732 --> 01:48:10.024
Running late, I suppose.

1196
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:11.109
How late?

1197
01:48:12.111 --> 01:48:13.486
Beats me.

1198
01:48:13.571 --> 01:48:14.946
Gets here when it gets here.

1199
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:17.782
Goddamn trains.
Never can rely on 'em, huh?

1200
01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.709
By the window!

1201
01:48:57.031 --> 01:48:58.239
You know...

1202
01:49:00.492 --> 01:49:02.368
I ain't stubborn.

1203
01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:05.330
Excuse me?

1204
01:49:06.582 --> 01:49:08.583
You said I was stubborn

1205
01:49:08.667 --> 01:49:10.835
for keeping my family
on a dying ranch.

1206
01:49:12.963 --> 01:49:15.048
It's my son Mark.

1207
01:49:15.132 --> 01:49:17.133
The young one?

1208
01:49:17.218 --> 01:49:21.054
He got tuberculosis when he was 2.

1209
01:49:21.138 --> 01:49:23.181
The doctor said he'd die

1210
01:49:23.265 --> 01:49:25.350
if he didn't have a dry climate, so...

1211
01:49:25.434 --> 01:49:26.976
Why are you telling me this?

1212
01:49:29.021 --> 01:49:30.980
I don't know.

1213
01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:33.233
I guess I just...

1214
01:49:33.317 --> 01:49:38.363
wanted you to know
that I ain't stubborn is all.

1215
01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:16.442
Well, as long as we're
making confessions...

1216
01:50:16.527 --> 01:50:18.069
Yeah?

1217
01:50:18.153 --> 01:50:20.113
I've been to Yuma Prison before.

1218
01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:23.825
Twice.

1219
01:50:23.909 --> 01:50:25.618
Escaped twice, too.

1220
01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.936
First car, sliding door.

1221
01:51:46.408 --> 01:51:47.700
They'll be coming!

1222
01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:11.557
Yeah!

1223
01:52:27.324 --> 01:52:29.242
I got a prisoner to go to Yuma!

1224
01:52:35.833 --> 01:52:37.750
Well, you did it, Dan.

1225
01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:40.211
No!

1226
01:52:51.432 --> 01:52:53.349
Pa.

1227
01:53:20.586 --> 01:53:23.713
For a one-leg rancher...

1228
01:53:26.425 --> 01:53:29.969
he's one tough son of a bitch.

1229
01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:32.513
Yeah.

1230
01:54:36.119 --> 01:54:37.662
You done it, Pa.

1231
01:54:40.457 --> 01:54:41.958
You done it.

1232
01:54:44.253 --> 01:54:46.462
You got him on the train.

1233
01:55:42.811 --> 01:55:44.437
Pa.
