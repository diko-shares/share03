1
00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:54.513
What are you going to cook?

2
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.056
Your favorite.

3
00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.641
What, again?

4
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.198
Well, this is the last one.

5
00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:16.451
What, you mean my tomatoes?

6
00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.955
Can never have enough
tins of tomatoes, eh?

7
00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.916
Instead...

8
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.376
we've five tons of chick peas.

9
00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.419
Ooh.

10
00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.212
That should last
at least five year, eh?

11
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.175
Fancy a glass of wine?

12
00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.052
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

13
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:37.681
Hey;

14
00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:42.561
You're in luck.

15
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.732
Drinkable.

16
00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.460
You all right, sweetheart?

17
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.961
Yeah, I'm fine.

18
00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.843
Well, I'm not fine.
lt's all fucked, isn't it?

19
00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.054
Our children are safe, aren't they?

20
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.680
Totally, yeah.

21
00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:20.307
Thank God we paid
for that school trip.

22
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.184
Can you imagine if we
hadn't have done that?

23
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.685
No, I can't...
I can't imagine.

24
00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.812
I can't imagine.

25
00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:27.648
And I don't want you to imagine it.

26
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:30.275
Listen, they're
far, far away,

27
00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.070
and they're safe and sound.

28
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.072
Okay?

29
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.114
Yeah.

30
00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:37.658
Yeah.

31
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:38.825
Okay.

32
00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.496
Don't worry...

33
00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.581
Gorgeous.

34
00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:00.472
Not interrupting, am I?

35
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.852
No.

36
00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:08.438
I found this in the cellar.

37
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.107
I'd forgotten all about it.

38
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.900
I thought we could have them
after dinner.

39
00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.195
Yeah.

40
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:33.171
Mmm! It smells wonderful.

41
00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:35.257
And is that a bottle of wine, Don?

42
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.259
Yes, indeed, Geoff.

43
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.927
Ah, thank you.

44
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.304
There's chocolate for after.

45
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.764
Courtesy of your good lady wife.

46
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:43.974
What have we here?

47
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:50.021
I get blackberries, vanilla,
notes of autumn.

48
00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.652
Karen...

49
00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.493
He'll be hungry.

50
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.081
He'll be hungry when he gets back.

51
00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:09.624
He'll want something to eat.

52
00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.459
Here we go again.

53
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.085
Jacob, no.

54
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.129
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart.

55
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.047
It's been five days since
your boyfriend run out on us.

56
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.800
If he's breathing, it won't
be pasta he's interested in.

57
00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:19.634
Jacob!

58
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:21.970
It'll be your fucking neck!

59
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.722
D-D-Don't say that.

60
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:24.806
Out of orde , Jacob.

61
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.100
Why? We all know it's true.

62
00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:29.436
The sooner she faces it, the better.

63
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.438
There are no survivors.

64
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.149
It's just us in here
and them out there.

65
00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.280
- Sam...!
- Quiet!

66
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.990
Let me in!
- lt's a boy.

67
00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.159
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

68
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.494
Don't know who's out there.

69
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.120
Please, let me in!

70
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:48.997
Don, it's a kid!

71
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.248
Help! Let me in!

72
00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.002
Bloody hell.

73
00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.966
Please, please let me in!

74
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.510
L'm coming, I'm coming...

75
00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:02.928
Let me in!

76
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.474
Please! Help me!

77
00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:08.892
Please!

78
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:10.894
Get in, get in.

79
00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.188
Come on, get in!
Come on!

80
00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.079
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

81
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.205
Yeah.

82
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.296
Where have you come from?

83
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.631
Sanford.

84
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.967
Sanford's upriver a few miles.

85
00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.928
How did you get here?

86
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.847
They were chasing me.

87
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.348
Screaming.

88
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.059
I was scared.
I ran.

89
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.103
I tried...
I tried other houses.

90
00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.521
They were empty.

91
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:58.024
I came through the woods...

92
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.903
Who were chasing you?

93
00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:04.322
My mum, my dad...

94
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.992
They're trying to kill me.

95
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.745
There's others, too.

96
00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.330
How many?

97
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.417
Loads

98
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.626
Sam.

99
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.342
lt's got my arm!

100
00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.344
Help me!

101
00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.494
Come on! Get out of here!

102
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.537
Don!

103
00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:55.457
Everybody go! Go!

104
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.917
Geoff, I can't see!

105
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.501
Hold onto my hand!

106
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.755
Get back!

107
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.684
Come back!

108
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.480
Oh, God.

109
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.276
Follow Jacob.

110
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.778
Keep going.
Darling, there's no time!

111
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.696
Come on!
Come on!

112
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.406
For God's sake, go!

113
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.166
Fuck!

114
00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:40.877
Where are you!?

115
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:45.215
Alice! Alice, no!
Alice!

116
00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.056
Geoff, come on!
Come on!

117
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:55.850
Geoff!

118
00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.688
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand, Sally!

119
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:03.191
Geoff! No! No!

120
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:04.859
Help me!

121
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.787
Alice! Alice!

122
00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.876
Where are you!?

123
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.669
Just leave him.

124
00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:23.670
Just leave him.

125
00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:24.671
I see him!

126
00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.048
- Leave him!
- Let go!

127
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.430
Don! Help us!

128
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.602
Don!

129
00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.898
Help us!

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.627
Don!

Don!

132
00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.927

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:56.698
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

140
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.783

144
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.387
Welcome to London.

145
00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.933
Hey, Doyle,
you having fun down there?

146
00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:49.435
You can kiss my ass.

147
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.396
This is the worst combat I ever saw.

148
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:52.605
Where's the fucking combat?

149
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:53.815
Yeah, I hear you.

150
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.275
Give me something to shoot.

151
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.567
Too easy.

152
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.944
PILOT;
Northeastern Med Center,

153
00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.153
20th floor, three windows in.

154
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.281
Fat guy jerking off in the toilet.

155
00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.616
Oh, bug nuts-
him again- I saw him yesterday.

156
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.951
I don't see him.

157
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.077
Where is Fester Fuck Nut?

158
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.495
Oh, your boyfriend?

159
00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.164
There he is, with his dick
in his hand on the 20th floor.

160
00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.499
Yeah, next to the fire exit, man.

161
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.001
Oh, shit.

162
00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.460
I think he needs
a jerk-off extender.

163
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.129
Hey, Doyle, you're the expert
in hand-to-hand combat.

164
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.297
- Man-to-man combat.
- Shut up.

165
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.173
I think it might be your dad, Doyle.

166
00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:22.010
- Ooh!
- You got him.

167
00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:52.540
Shit.

168
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.209
Colonel Phillips here.

169
00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.836
What is your current status?

170
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.171
Good morning, Colonel.

171
00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.340
Morning.

172
00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:03.092
Colonel, I'm watching
the new arrivals disembark.

173
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.927
Yes, Major.

174
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.346
It'll take all morning
to process them.

175
00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.348
Copy.

176
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.516
No one told me that we're
now admitting children.

177
00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:26.574
just follow around to your right.

178
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.589
<i>$4'</i>

179
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.852
Green and brown.

180
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.062
Interesting iris variation.

181
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.523
It's usually hereditary.

182
00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.274
Do one of your parents
have the same?

183
00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.653
My mother, she did.

184
00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.244
How old are you, Andy?

185
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.495
Twelve.

186
00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.957
I think that makes you
the youngest person

187
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.750
in the entire country.

188
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.837
Well, your blood
pressure is A-OK

189
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.257
and you're negative on any
serious diseases or afflictions.

190
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.050
I think you're okay to come in.

191
00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.344
Welcome back to Britain.

192
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:55.580
<i>$4'</i>

193
00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.115
We are headed

194
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.493
for the green zone,
our area of security

195
00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:37.163
and reconstruction,
designated as District One.

196
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:40.249
District One is located
on the Isle of Dogs.

197
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.376
Although the Isle of Dogs
is completely safe,

198
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.964
the surrounding area of London
is not.

199
00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:50.092
There are a large number of
bodies still left to be cleared

200
00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.178
from the original outbreak
of infection.

201
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:56.807
Rats and wild dogs
are prevalent, as is disease.

202
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:59.352
New arrivals are reminded,
for their own safety,

203
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:01.437
it is absolutely forbidden

204
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.357
to cross the river
and leave the security zone.

205
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.944
You will be joining
15,000 civilians

206
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.613
who are already resident
in District One.

207
00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.990
As we approach your new home,

208
00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:16.869
you will notice a dramatically
increased military presence.

209
00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.789
The U.S. Army is responsible
for your safety.

210
00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.208
We will do everything we can do

211
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.503
to make your repatriation
as easy as possible.

212
00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:27.046
Inside District One, however,

213
00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:29.340
we believe you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

214
00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.592
We have hot and cold
running water,

215
00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:36.097
24-hour electricity,
a medical center, a supermarket

216
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.223
and even a pub.

217
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.310
That sounds good.

218
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.480
We're nearly home.

219
00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.492

220
00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:02.415

221
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.048
- Dad!
- lt's Dad!

222
00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.675
- Dad!
- Dad! Come on.

223
00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.367
- I'm excited.
- Yeah.

224
00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.410
You excited?

225
00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.203
Hey!

226
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:45.583
Oh!

227
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.336
I missed you so much.

228
00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:51.547
You all right?
You all right?

229
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.845
I never thought I'd see you
again, you know that?

230
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.784
<i>WOMAN'.
I am the chief medical officer.</i>

231
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:21.869
<i>I should have been notified
before children were brought in.</i>

232
00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:24.789
<i>We've not even established
the protocol for minors.</i>

233
00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:27.625
<i>We have issues of disease
and sanitation,</i>

234
00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:30.795
not to mention, we don't fully
understand the virus yet.

235
00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:33.381
We understand that it did not
manage to go across species.

236
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:34.548
- Yes.
- That it did not

237
00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.633
manage to go airborne,

238
00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:36.967
and that the last infected human

239
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.345
died six months ago.

240
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:41.180
We weren't here six months ago.

241
00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:42.264
Major...

242
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.188
What are you afraid of?

243
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:50.564
What if it comes back?

244
00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.191
It won't come back.

245
00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.359
What if it does?

246
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.695
If it comes back, we kill it.

247
00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:58.155
Code Red.

248
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:09.333
Come on, guys.

249
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.253
What about this place, then, Andy?

250
00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:14.255
Eh?

251
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.382
Yeah, it's pretty good, Dad.

252
00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.977
Look at the camera.

253
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.937
This way.
That's good.

254
00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:33.566
There's 25 floors.

255
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.067
We get the penthouse up there.

256
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.068
- Really?
- Really.

257
00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:37.695
L.D., sir.

258
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:40.239
- Thank you.
- So what do you do here, Dad?

259
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:41.323
What do I do?

260
00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:42.575
L'm a section officer.

261
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.118
I keep the lights on,

262
00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.828
the water running, the heat running.

263
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.414
See, that's what this says.

264
00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:51.751
Triple A- “access all areas.”
That's me.

265
00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.586
I basically run the place, you know?

266
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:55.755
Well, you're the caretaker,
really, aren't you?

267
00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:02.595
No, I run the place.

268
00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.020
Wow!

269
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.605
Like it?

270
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:13.689
It's amazing.

271
00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.733
What? Even better than sunny Spain?

272
00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:17.818
You ought to have seen
the refugee camps, Dad.

273
00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.696
There were 20 of us in each
tent and chemical toilets.

274
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.948
<i>Oh.</i>

275
00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:24.784
- Everything smelled of piss.
- Nice.

276
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:29.079
We'll be moving to
our new house soon,

277
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:32.124
a couple of months, in fact.

278
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.501
A new house?

279
00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:35.711
Yeah.

280
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:41.383
Listen, I hope you guys
understand, urn...

281
00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:45.387
we're not going to be able
to go back to our old house.

282
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:47.431
It's outside the security zone,

283
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.892
and anyway, I don't think
I'd want to go back there,

284
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.937
even if I could.

285
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.398
What happened, Dad- to Mum?

286
00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.652
Yeah.

287
00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:05.282
Yeah.

288
00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:08.994
Do you want to sit down and
I'll tell you all about it?

289
00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:26.303
Your mum and I were
hiding in a house.

290
00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:30.182
A wee cottage.

291
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:39.775
There was an old couple that...
owned it.

292
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.236
And they were there, too.

293
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.948
Three other people.

294
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:50.077
And we were, uh...

295
00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:54.498
...just trying to
stay alive, I suppose.

296
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.751
We were doing okay for a while.

297
00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.795
And then we were attacked.

298
00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:07.177
They came in
through the kitchen window.

299
00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:10.306
They were really fast, you know?

300
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.019
Chased us.

301
00:23:16.854 --> 00:23:18.814
Chased your mum.

302
00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.943
And we were trapped.

303
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.071
Trapped in the bedroom.

304
00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:27.907
Don!

305
00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:32.036
I s...

306
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:35.998
I seen them...

307
00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:39.501
biting...

308
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:43.339
I couldn't do anything.

309
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.639
I tried to go back.

310
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:56.727
She was already gone.

311
00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.902
She was already gone.

312
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.864
Was there nothing you could do?

313
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.243
No, there was nothing I could do.

314
00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:20.042
I managed to get away.

315
00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:25.923
Just running, running and running.

316
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.931
I got to this military camp.

317
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.644
And you know the rest, you know,
I've been in quarantine,

318
00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:41.230
waiting for you guys to come back.

319
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:50.572
We're just happy you're still alive.

320
00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:08.757

Sunday afternoon, clear blue skies.

332
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:20.746
I'm laying in bed with
my wife and... now I'm back

00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:21.747

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:15.647
We have two strays that just
slipped out the north gate.

372
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.025
- Stray dogs?
- No, puppies.

Yeah!

Yeah, if it had keys.

I apologize for these precautions.

412
00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:14.334
It's standard protocol when
dealing with any survivors.

413
00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:16.294
Though we haven't had
to do it for a while.

414
00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:17.670
The last survivor
we came across

415
00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:20.006
was over two months ago.

416
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:24.803
Can you tell me
anything about

417
00:38:24.886 --> 00:38:28.264
how you managed to...
keep... alive

418
00:38:28.348 --> 00:38:30.558
while you were gone so long?

419
00:38:34.854 --> 00:38:36.856
Do you know of any other survivors?

420
00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:41.945
Okay.

421
00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:46.825
Just going to take a blood sample.

422
00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:48.117
It won't hurt.

423
00:38:58.503 --> 00:39:01.005
Have you come
into direct contact

424
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:02.966
with the infected?

425
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:13.768
Okay.

426
00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.114
I want to see my children.

427
00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:34.038
Of course. Of course.

428
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:54.517
Mr. Harris.

429
00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:56.769
- Yeah.
- We found your kids.

430
00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:58.563
Oh, thank God, thank God.
Thank you so much.

431
00:39:58.646 --> 00:40:01.024
We found your wife, too.

432
00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:14.871
Can they hear me?

433
00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:17.123
So what did you two think
you were playing at?

434
00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:19.000
You said you saw her die.

435
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.627
What?

436
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.503
You said you saw her die!

437
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:26.591
I didn't say that.

438
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.760
You did, you said
you saw her die, you did.

439
00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.094
Baby, I didn't use those words.

440
00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:31.471
This is...

441
00:40:31.554 --> 00:40:34.599
I don't know, I mean,
it's confusing, you know?

442
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:38.436
It's very hard for you
to imagine, you know?

443
00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:39.729
It's-it's too hard to explain.

444
00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:42.565
Well, try to explain it, Dad, try!

445
00:40:42.649 --> 00:40:44.567
Try? What do you want me to say?
I thought I saw Mom...

446
00:40:46.402 --> 00:40:47.362
die.

447
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.489
I wouldn't have told you that...

448
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:51.115
I was sure.

449
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:56.329
Guys, I'm not sure
what's happening here,

450
00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:58.623
but it's good.

451
00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:01.960
Okay? That's the point.

452
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:03.127
Morn is alive.

453
00:41:03.211 --> 00:41:04.379

There's no question, sir.

456
00:41:45.128 --> 00:41:47.422
She has the virus.
She's infected.

457
00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:52.677
Why isn't she showing any symptoms?

458
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.845
I don't know.

459
00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:54.846
Speculate.

460
00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:01.686
<i>A genetic abnormality which acts</i>

461
00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:03.604
as some sort of natural immunity.

462
00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:05.356
<i>But the virus
is still in her blood</i>

463
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.691
and saliva, <i>so...</i>

464
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:09.360
technically, she's not immune.

465
00:42:09.444 --> 00:42:11.112
She's a carrier.

466
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.449
Are you saying she has
the ability to infect others?

467
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:15.908
Yes, sir.

468
00:42:15.992 --> 00:42:17.118
Absolutely.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.041
If this woman has
natural immunity,

470
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:24.709
she is incredibly valuable.

471
00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:27.462
Her blood could contain the
key to a vaccine, even a cure.

472
00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:40.099

473
00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:46.230

Please forgive me.

479
00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:10.046
Please, sir, we need
some time to study her.

480
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:11.422
We need to run some tests.

00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.474
- All snipers in position.
- Roger that.

556
00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:22.144
Ground forces to med center.
Ground force to med center.

557
00:50:24.063 --> 00:50:26.982
- Sector One covered.
- Where's my spotter?

558
00:50:33.072 --> 00:50:34.615
Girls, stay calm.

559
00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:58.097
Dad.

560
00:51:17.157 --> 00:51:19.994
My dad! My dad!

561
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:21.996
He's in here!

562
00:52:30.898 --> 00:52:32.358
<i>No.1.!</i>

563
00:52:45.913 --> 00:52:48.415
No!

564
00:53:01.387 --> 00:53:04.598
Confirm: Only target infected.

565
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:06.183
Roger that.
Only target infected.

566
00:53:14.775 --> 00:53:16.944
Targeting right.
I got two down.

567
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:22.533
Watch out for the friendlies.

568
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:23.951
Watch out for the friendlies.

569
00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:25.452
I can't get a shot.

570
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:30.833
Oh, man, this is FUBAR.

571
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:35.045
We got a group
there at twelve o'clock.

572
00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:37.381
L've got three on the ground.

573
00:53:37.464 --> 00:53:39.383
Got four on the ground.
Got four.

574
00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:43.721
16 down.

575
00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:49.309
I got two by the jeep.

576
00:53:53.105 --> 00:53:54.940
Jesus!

577
00:53:55.023 --> 00:53:56.442
I don't see who's a target.

578
00:54:00.404 --> 00:54:02.614
On the move! On the move!
On the move!

579
00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:04.575
Move it right! Move it right!

580
00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:06.994
I can't find
another damn target here.

581
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:10.998
I can't get a shot.

582
00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:13.417
Whiskey Three,
why have you stopped firing?

583
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.793
Come in, Whiskey Three.

584
00:54:15.878 --> 00:54:17.838
Abandon selective targeting.

585
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.506
Shoot everything.
Targets are now free.

586
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.091
I cannot contain spreading.

587
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:23.677
We've lost control.

588
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:30.058
All units, all units,

589
00:54:30.142 --> 00:54:32.978
this is Medical Commanding
Officer Sierra Lima.

590
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:39.526
Please be on the lookout for
a young boy, age 12, name Andy.

591
00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:45.532
If he is located, he must
be immediately evacuated

592
00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:46.867
from the containment zone.

593
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.286
We have to find Andy.

594
00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:51.038
We have to find him!

595
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:53.499
It's okay. lt's okay.
We're gonna find him.

596
00:54:53.582 --> 00:54:55.292
L'm gonna find him, I promise.

597
00:54:55.375 --> 00:54:57.127
L'm gonna get him out of here.

598
00:54:57.211 --> 00:54:59.129
L'm gonna get you both out of here.

599
00:54:59.213 --> 00:55:01.465
Trust me.

600
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:23.654
Which shot?

601
00:55:23.737 --> 00:55:24.988
Abandon selective targeting.

602
00:55:25.072 --> 00:55:26.865
All targets are now free.

603
00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:29.076
What? Confirm order.

604
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.954
Rooftop units,
target everyone at ground level.

605
00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:33.664
No exceptions.

606
00:55:33.747 --> 00:55:35.999
Repeat: no exceptions.

607
00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:45.425
Run!

608
00:56:02.818 --> 00:56:04.903
Three down!
One of ours down there!

609
00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:06.864
Three o'clock!

610
00:56:19.835 --> 00:56:21.378
Taking 'em down,
taking 'em down.

611
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:22.838
That's it, at three o'clock!

612
00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:30.095
Kid! Over here!

613
00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:32.681
Kid! Over here!

614
00:56:46.528 --> 00:56:48.739
Take 'em out! Take 'em out!

615
00:56:48.822 --> 00:56:51.950
I got two fuckers on me.
Doyle, I got two fuckers on me!

616
00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.205
Fuck.

617
00:57:10.636 --> 00:57:12.137
Fuck!

618
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.542
<i>$4'</i>

619
00:58:02.604 --> 00:58:05.816
Shh, shh, shh.

620
00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:08.026
It's all right. lt's all right.

621
00:58:09.236 --> 00:58:11.238
Shh, shh, shh.

622
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.212
Tam?

623
00:58:27.295 --> 00:58:30.716
<i>$4'</i>

624
00:58:35.554 --> 00:58:37.764
<i>$4'</i>

625
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.027
This is madness.

626
00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:52.571
What's happening?

627
00:58:52.654 --> 00:58:53.905
They're shooting everybody.

628
00:58:53.989 --> 00:58:55.323
Why?

629
00:58:55.407 --> 00:58:56.992
It makes no sense.

630
00:58:57.075 --> 00:58:58.952
It makes perfect sense.

631
00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:02.330
It's Code Red.

632
00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:04.875
<i>$4'</i>

633
00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:16.803
I saw Dad.

634
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:19.347
Where?

635
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:21.475
He's one of them.

636
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:26.646
SCARLET;
Step one: kill the infected.

637
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.108
Step two: containment.

638
00:59:30.192 --> 00:59:33.612
If containment fails...

639
00:59:33.695 --> 00:59:37.282
step three: extermination.

640
00:59:37.365 --> 00:59:40.077
And now they won't stop
until everyone is dead.

641
00:59:41.286 --> 00:59:43.872
So what do we do?

642
00:59:43.955 --> 00:59:49.419
I mean, I'm not sitting around
hereto get exterminated.

643
00:59:49.503 --> 00:59:51.129
We've got to get out of here.

644
00:59:51.213 --> 00:59:53.840
If we take one step
out of that door,

645
00:59:53.924 --> 00:59:57.260
if the infected don't get us,
the snipers will.

646
00:59:57.344 --> 01:00:00.430
Well, you don't have
a choice, my friend.

647
01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.349
Right now it's dark out there.

648
01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:06.061
The snipers can see through
their night scopes, but...

649
01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.939
at least you have some limited
cover from the infected.

650
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.609
But, you know,
ifyou want to wait till sunup,

651
01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.486
then you're as good as dead.

652
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:18.031
Who are you?

653
01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.742
Sergeant Doyle, Delta, Rooftop Unit.

654
01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:22.536
Why aren't you at your post?

655
01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:25.372
<i>Why EVENT you?</i>

656
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.794
Look, you guys do
what you want, but, uh...

657
01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.630
I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.

658
01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:35.632
You coming?

659
01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:44.141
'Kay, come on.

660
01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.152
There's less shooting.

661
01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.904
Maybe they've got it under control.

662
01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.406
Or less shooters.

663
01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.117
All right, listen,
I need you guys

664
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.828
to look at me and only me, okay?

665
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.163
You run when I run.

666
01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:07.998
Be my shadow, that's it, right?

667
01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.249
Get around back.

668
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.043
Watch her.

669
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:13.670
Ready?

670
01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.422
Let's go.

671
01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:26.725
Stay.

672
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.398
Doyle, come in.

673
01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:39.988
Then go.

674
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:41.573
Doyle, where the fuck are you, man?

675
01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.578
Ground level,

676
01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:47.662
District One.

677
01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:49.497
Shit! Closed frequency.

678
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:50.582
Copy that.

679
01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:56.087
What the fuck are you doing there?

680
01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:58.798
Listen to me, you've got some
serious shit coming your way.

681
01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.926
We've already got some serious shit.

682
01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:02.344
No. I'm not fucking playing;
this is worse.

683
01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:04.012
The air cav,
theyjust got their orders.

684
01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.055
They're firebombing

685
01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.264
all of District One.

686
01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.683
That was fast.

687
01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.685
Outbreak is out of control.
They're taking no chances.

688
01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.437
So unless you are
out of the target zone,

689
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.398
you are getting cooked, you got me?

690
01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:16.441
How long we got?

691
01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:17.442
They're already on their way.

692
01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:18.443
You got four minutes, tops.

693
01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:19.611
But listen, I got some

694
01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:21.112
clear landing ground
at Regents Park.

695
01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:23.114
That's the pickup point.
Got it?

696
01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:24.950
L'll be back in touch.

697
01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:29.120
Hey, Doyle, you fuckin' better be.

698
01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:31.164
All right, look, guys,
we got to run, okay?

699
01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.582
Just stay low and stay fast.

700
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.501
Okay? After me.
Let's go.

701
01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.218
Sniper!

702
01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.636
- Back! Back! Back!
- Get down! Sniper!

703
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:47.722
Get back! Get back!

704
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.560
- Back!
- Andy, get in!

705
01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:58.775
lt's okay.

706
01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:01.444
It'sjust a flesh wound.

707
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.871
All right.

708
01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:18.628
Multiple shots, one hit.

709
01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:22.007
He's panicked, and no marksman.

710
01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.471
All right.

711
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.267
- What's your name?
- Sam.

712
01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.602
Hey, Sam. Get close.

713
01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.313
You see that doorway?

714
01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.273
I need you to run
as fast as you can

715
01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.566
in a zigzag like this, okay?

716
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.277
And don't stop for anything, okay?

717
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.445
You want me to be bait.

718
01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:44.529
No, no.
Look, he's gonna

719
01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:45.905
take shots at you, all right?

720
01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.991
But he's gonna miss.

721
01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.326
All right? He's gonna
expose his position.

722
01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:51.536
It means I get a shot at
him, and I won't miss.

723
01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.288
You're out of your fucking mind.

724
01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.206
- There's no way I'm going out there.
- Stay back.

725
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.917
Two minutes, we're all gonna die.

726
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:00.837
You want that?

727
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.839
' No!

728
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:04.966
Fuck!

729
01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.786
Good work, kid.

730
01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:41.127
The fence!
Watch it, watch it!

731
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.170
Behind me.

732
01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:43.755
Go! Go!

733
01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:44.506
Go!

734
01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:48.176
Come on.

735
01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.761
Come on, come on.

736
01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:50.970

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.824
This is Red Fox One pouring whiskey.

738
01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:15.954
Keep going.
We'll be safe under the river.

Come on! Come on!

746
01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.508
Bring in bio-soldier units.

747
01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.885
Fan out to the
predesignated positions.

748
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:39.180
Bio units, copy.

749
01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:41.182
Use of chemical weapons authorized.

750
01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:42.350
Repeat: all units,

751
01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:44.435
chemical weapons are authorized.

Stay close.

759
01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.090
They left us again.

760
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.221
Do you think Mum's still alive?

761
01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.268
Not this time.

762
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.428
You look a little pale.

763
01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:48.971
Blood makes me nauseous.

764
01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.474
You never answered my question.

765
01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:54.936
About why you left your post.

766
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:58.189
I got that boy in my sights.

767
01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.904
He's not a target anymore.

768
01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:12.370
When we were separated...

769
01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:15.581
I thought I'd lost you, too.

770
01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.545
We won't get separated again.

771
01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:23.089
We'll stay together,
whatever happens.

772
01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:26.968
Whatever happens.

773
01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.053
It's all fucked.

774
01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:34.934
You hear it all over
the radios- fucked.

775
01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:45.695
Anyway...
what about you?

776
01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.738
Why the hell are you here?

777
01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:50.616
Their mother...

778
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.245
had very special blood.

779
01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:57.331
Natural kind of immunity
to the virus.

780
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.131
Not all genetic traits
are passed on, you know.

781
01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:09.135
They can skip a generation
or vanish altogether, but...

782
01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.137
But they might have it.

783
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.181
It's a possibility.

784
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:20.897
So their lives are
far more valuable than mine.

785
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.651
Or yours.

786
01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:30.072
I got it.

787
01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:33.075
Doyle!

788
01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:36.662
DOyle!

789
01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:37.914
Flynn, go.

790
01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:39.874
You made it.

791
01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.167
I knew you'd do it, buddy.

792
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.835
Listen, I am coming
to you right now,

793
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.629
but keep a lookout, okay?

794
01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:46.297
There's confirmed sightings
of infected

795
01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.174
that have escaped the fire bombings.

796
01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.258
Give me an ETA.

797
01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:50.885
About 60.

798
01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:51.886
Minutes?

799
01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.220
No.

800
01:13:53.304 --> 01:13:54.388
Seconds.

801
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.558
Kids, come on!

802
01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:03.940
Get down.

803
01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.525
Get down! Get down.

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:28.547

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.257
Coming in!

807
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.510
Jesus, Doyle,
you got people with you.

808
01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:33.970
Who the fuck are those people?!

809
01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:49.777
DOyle!

810
01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.238
Who the fuck are those people?!

811
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.572
I can't take them!

812
01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.075
We will get shot out of
the sky if I try to land...

813
01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.285
No, no, don't take them to base!

814
01:14:58.369 --> 01:14:59.412
Take them over the channel!

815
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:00.746
What?!

816
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.790
You got to get these kids
out of here, Flynn!

817
01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:05.001
Get the fuck in, Doyle!
I'm not taking them!

818
01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:07.044
- L'm not leaving them!
- Get me out of here!

819
01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:11.132
Hey! Get him off of there!

820
01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:12.508
Get the fuck off...!

821
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.927
Okay.

822
01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:19.890
- Stop!
- Come on!

823
01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:36.407
Flynn, we're gonna fucking

824
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.658
die down here!
Do something!

825
01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:44.498
Come on, you fuckers.

826
01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.259
Get up, get up, get up!

827
01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:56.469
Run! Move it!

828
01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.574
Don't look back!

829
01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:19.658
Keep going!

830
01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:23.162
Keep going.

831
01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.296
Fuck you.

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:51.357
Doyle, come in!

833
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.443
Doyle! You need to get
to safe ground!

834
01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:55.444
Get to the stadium!

835
01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:56.445
Ditch those people!

836
01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:57.696

838
01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.338
Flynn, goddamn it,
I know you can hear me.

839
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.382
Fuck the Code Red.
Fuck the chain of command.

840
01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.342
L'm stuck out here and need
an extraction, goddamn it.

841
01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:20.803
Better fucking be there,
because we will be.

842

843
01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:23.973
Yeah?

844
01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.307
Bet you're tired, huh?

845
01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:26.350
Me, too.

846

Look, I need you to help me, okay?

847
01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.061
Help me with your sister.

All right, pop the clutch

You're doing great.
just hold, hold the rail.

It's okay!
lt's okay!

It's okay, all right?

917
01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:16.426
Grab ahold of
the other railing, okay?

918
01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:18.887
Scarlet, I can't see anything!

919
01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.389
Okay, go to your right.

920
01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:22.391
Go to your right.

921
01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:23.809
All right, try and skip...

922
01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.770
just-just put your leg
far out in front of you, okay?

923
01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:28.522
Good girl.
Hold onto the rail.

924
01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:30.482
Careful!

925
01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:38.407
Andy! Where are you?!

926
01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:46.790
Andy! Where are you, Andy?!

927
01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.000

929
01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:56.842
Tammy!

930
01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.804

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:03.640
Tammy, I'm coming!

933
01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:04.808
Scarlet, I've lost Andy.

934
01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:06.602
It's okay. lt's okay.
I'm right here.

935
01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:07.603
L've lost Andy.

936
01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:09.104
It's okay.

937
01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.480
There you go.

938
01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:12.691
Just slowly, towards me...

939
01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.109
I lost Andy.

940
01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.697
We'll find Andy.

941
01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:28.165

943
01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:42.846
Where are you?!

944
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.075
Scarlet.

945
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.507
Tammy?

946
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.758
Tammy?!

947
01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:23.220
Scarlet?!

948
01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:51.832
No!

949
01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:56.503
Don't!

We stay together,

951
01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:57.731
whatever happens.

952
01:27:57.814 --> 01:27:59.399
No!

953
01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:00.942

954
01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.111
Andy, no!

955
01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:04.529
No, Andy!

956
01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:11.036
Andy! Andy!

957
01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:13.079
