1
00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.514
What are you going to cook?

2
00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:56.057
Your favorite.

3
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.643
What, again?

4
00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.199
Well, this is the last one.

5
00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:16.453
What, you mean my tomatoes?

6
00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:19.956
Can never have enough
tins of tomatoes, eh?

7
00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.917
Instead...

8
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.377
we've five tons of chick peas.

9
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:25.420
Ooh.

10
00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:27.213
That should last
at least five year, eh?

11
00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:32.177
Fancy a glass of wine?

12
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.053
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

13
00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:37.682
Hey, hey.

14
00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:42.562
You're in luck.

15
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.733
Drinkable.

16
00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:06.461
You all right, sweetheart?

17
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:07.962
Yeah, I'm fine.

18
00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:14.844
Well, I'm not fine.
It's all fucked, isn't it?

19
00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:17.055
Our children are safe, aren't they?

20
00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:18.681
Totally, yeah.

21
00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:20.308
Thank God we paid
for that school trip.

22
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:22.185
Can you imagine if we
hadn't have done that?

23
00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:23.686
No, I can't...
I can't imagine.

24
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.814
I can't imagine.

25
00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:27.649
And I don't want you to imagine it.

26
00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:30.276
Listen, they're
far, far away,

27
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.071
and they're safe and sound.

28
00:02:33.154 --> 00:02:35.073
Okay?

29
00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:36.115
Yeah.

30
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.659
Yeah.

31
00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:38.826
Okay.

32
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.497
Don't worry...

33
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.582
Gorgeous.

34
00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:00.473
Not interrupting, am I?

35
00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:05.853
No.

36
00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:08.439
I found this in the cellar.

37
00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:10.108
I'd forgotten all about it.

38
00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:11.901
I thought we could have them
after dinner.

39
00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:15.197
Yeah.

40
00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:33.173
Mmm! It smells wonderful.

41
00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:35.258
And is that a bottle of wine, Don?

42
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:37.260
Yes, indeed, Geoff.

43
00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:38.928
Ah, thank you.

44
00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:41.306
There's chocolate for after.

45
00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.765
Courtesy of your good lady wife.

46
00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:43.975
What have we here?

47
00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:50.023
I get blackberries, vanilla,
notes of autumn.

48
00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:55.653
Karen...

49
00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:03.495
He'll be hungry.

50
00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:08.082
He'll be hungry when he gets back.

51
00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:09.626
He'll want something to eat.

52
00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.460
Here we go again.

53
00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:12.086
Jacob, no.

54
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.130
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart.

55
00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:16.049
It's been five days since
your boyfriend run out on us.

56
00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:18.801
If he's breathing, it won't
be pasta he's interested in.

57
00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:19.636
Jacob!

58
00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:21.971
It'll be your fucking neck!

59
00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:23.723
D-D-Don't say that.

60
00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:24.807
Out of order, Jacob.

61
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.101
Why? We all know it's true.

62
00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:29.437
The sooner she faces it, the better.

63
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.439
There are no survivors.

64
00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:34.150
It's just us in here
and them out there.

65
00:04:38.738 --> 00:04:40.281
- Sam...!
- Quiet!

66
00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:41.992
- Let me in!
- It's a boy.

67
00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:44.160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

68
00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:45.495
Don't know who's out there.

69
00:04:45.578 --> 00:04:47.121
Please, let me in!

70
00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:48.998
Don, it's a kid!

71
00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:50.250
Help! Let me in!

72
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.003
Bloody hell.

73
00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:59.968
Please, please let me in!

74
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:01.511
I'm coming, I'm coming...

75
00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:02.929
Let me in!

76
00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:07.475
Please! Help me!

77
00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:08.893
Please!

78
00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:10.895
Get in, get in.

79
00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.189
Come on, get in!
Come on!

80
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.080
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

81
00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.206
Yeah.

82
00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.297
Where have you come from?

83
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:39.632
Sanford.

84
00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:41.968
Sanford's upriver a few miles.

85
00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.929
How did you get here?

86
00:05:45.013 --> 00:05:46.848
They were chasing me.

87
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.349
Screaming.

88
00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:51.061
I was scared.
I ran.

89
00:05:51.144 --> 00:05:53.104
I tried...
I tried other houses.

90
00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:54.522
They were empty.

91
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:58.025
I came through the woods...

92
00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:01.904
Who were chasing you?

93
00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:04.324
My mum, my dad...

94
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.993
They're trying to kill me.

95
00:06:09.287 --> 00:06:10.747
There's others, too.

96
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.332
How many?

97
00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:15.418
Loads.

98
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.627
Sam.

99
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.343
It's got my arm!

100
00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:26.346
Help me!

101
00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:51.495
Come on! Get out of here!

102
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:52.538
Don!

103
00:06:52.622 --> 00:06:55.458
Everybody go! Go!

104
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:56.917
Geoff, I can't see!

105
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:58.503
Hold onto my hand!

106
00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:01.756
Get back!

107
00:07:13.184 --> 00:07:14.686
Come back!

108
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.481
Oh, God.

109
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:23.277
Follow Jacob.

110
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.779
Keep going.
Darling, there's no time!

111
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:26.697
Come on!
Come on!

112
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.408
For God's sake, <i>go!</i>

113
00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:38.167
Fuck!

114
00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:40.879
Where are you!?

115
00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:45.216
Alice! Alice, no!
Alice!

116
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.057
Geoff, come on!
Come on!

117
00:07:54.892 --> 00:07:55.851
Geoff!

118
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.689
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand, Sally!

119
00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:03.192
Geoff! No! No!

120
00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:04.861
Help me!

121
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:15.788
Alice! Alice!

122
00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:21.878
Where are you!?

123
00:08:21.961 --> 00:08:22.670
Just leave him.

124
00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:23.671
Just leave him.

125
00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:24.672
I see him!

126
00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:27.049
- Leave him!
- Let go!

127
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.431
Don! Help us!

128
00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:39.603
Don!

129
00:08:42.106 --> 00:08:43.899
Help us!

130
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.628
Don!

131
00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:08.258
Don!

132
00:09:10.843 --> 00:09:12.928
Don!

133
00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:49.715
Jacob!

134
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.094
Go on!

135
00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:09.318
- Jacob!
- Don!

136
00:10:17.576 --> 00:10:18.577
Don!

137
00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:26.836
Jacob.

138
00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:56.699
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

139
00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:58.784
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

140
00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:42.388
Welcome to London.

141
00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.934
Hey, Doyle,
you having fun down there?

142
00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.436
You can kiss my ass.

143
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.397
This is the worst combat I ever saw.

144
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.606
Where's the fucking combat?

145
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.816
Yeah, I hear you.

146
00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:55.276
Give me something to shoot.

147
00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:56.569
Too easy.

148
00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:57.945
Northeastern Med Center,

149
00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.154
20th floor, three windows in.

150
00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:01.282
Fat guy jerking off in the toilet.

151
00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:03.617
Oh, bug nuts...
him again... I saw him yesterday.

152
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:04.952
I don't see him.

153
00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:06.078
Where is Fester Fuck Nut?

154
00:13:06.162 --> 00:13:07.497
Oh, your boyfriend?

155
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.166
There he is, with his dick
in his hand on the 20th floor.

156
00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:11.500
Yeah, next to the fire exit, man.

157
00:13:11.584 --> 00:13:13.002
Oh, shit.

158
00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:14.461
I think he needs
a jerk-off extender.

159
00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:16.130
Hey, Doyle, you're the expert
in hand-to-hand combat.

160
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:17.297
- Man-to-man combat.
- Shut up.

161
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:19.175
I think it might be your dad, Doyle.

162
00:13:19.258 --> 00:13:22.011
- Ooh!
- You got him.

163
00:13:51.123 --> 00:13:52.541
Shit.

164
00:13:54.043 --> 00:13:55.211
Colonel Phillips here.

165
00:13:55.294 --> 00:13:56.837
What is your current status?

166
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:58.172
Good morning, Colonel.

167
00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:00.340
Morning.

168
00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:03.093
Colonel, I'm watching
the new arrivals disembark.

169
00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:04.929
Yes, Major.

170
00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:06.347
It'll take all morning
to process them.

171
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.349
Copy.

172
00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:10.518
No one told me that we're
now admitting children.

173
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.575
Just follow around to your right.

174
00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:54.853
Green and brown.

175
00:14:54.937 --> 00:14:56.063
Interesting iris variation.

176
00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.523
It's usually hereditary.

177
00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:00.276
Do one of your parents
have the same?

178
00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:03.654
My mother, she did.

179
00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:11.245
How old are you, Andy?

180
00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:12.496
Twelve.

181
00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:15.958
I think that makes you
the youngest person

182
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.751
in the entire country.

183
00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:20.838
Well, your blood
pressure is A-OK

184
00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:24.258
and you're negative on any
serious diseases or afflictions.

185
00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.051
I think you're okay to come in.

186
00:15:26.135 --> 00:15:28.346
Welcome back to Britain.

187
00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:31.116
We are headed

188
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.494
for the green zone,
our area of security

189
00:16:33.577 --> 00:16:37.164
and reconstruction,
designated as District One.

190
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:40.250
District One is located
on the Isle of Dogs.

191
00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:42.378
Although the Isle of Dogs
is completely safe,

192
00:16:42.461 --> 00:16:46.966
the surrounding area of London
is not.

193
00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:50.094
There are a large number of
bodies still left to be cleared

194
00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:52.179
from the original outbreak
of infection.

195
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:56.809
Rats and wild dogs
are prevalent, as is disease.

196
00:16:56.892 --> 00:16:59.353
New arrivals are reminded,
for their own safety,

197
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.438
it is absolutely forbidden

198
00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:04.358
to cross the river
and leave the security zone.

199
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:07.945
You will be joining
15,000 civilians

200
00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:10.614
who are already resident
in District One.

201
00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:12.992
As we approach your new home,

202
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:16.870
you will notice a dramatically
increased military presence.

203
00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:19.790
The U.S. Army is responsible
for your safety.

204
00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.209
We will do everything we can do

205
00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:25.504
to make your repatriation
as easy as possible.

206
00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.047
Inside District One, however,

207
00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:29.342
we believe you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

208
00:17:29.425 --> 00:17:31.594
We have hot and cold
running water,

209
00:17:31.677 --> 00:17:36.098
24-hour electricity,
a medical center, a supermarket

210
00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:37.224
and even a pub.

211
00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:41.311
That sounds good.

212
00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.481
We're nearly home.

213
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.050
- Dad!
- It's Dad!

214
00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.676
- Dad!
- Dad! Come on.

215
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.368
- I'm excited.
- Yeah.

216
00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:39.411
You excited?

217
00:18:39.495 --> 00:18:41.205
Hey!

218
00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:45.584
Oh!

219
00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.336
I missed you so much.

220
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.548
You all right?
You all right?

221
00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:57.846
I never thought I'd see you
again, you know that?

222
00:19:17.533 --> 00:19:19.785
<i>I am the chief medical officer.</i>

223
00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.870
<i>I should have been notified
before children were brought in.</i>

224
00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:24.790
<i>We've not even established
the protocol for minors.</i>

225
00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.626
<i>We have issues of disease
and sanitation,</i>

226
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:30.795
not to mention, we don't fully
understand the virus yet.

227
00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:33.382
We understand that it did not
manage to go across species.

228
00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:34.549
- Yes.
- That it did not

229
00:19:34.633 --> 00:19:35.634
manage to go airborne,

230
00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:36.968
and that the last infected human

231
00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.346
died six months ago.

232
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.181
We weren't here six months ago.

233
00:19:41.265 --> 00:19:42.266
Major...

234
00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:49.190
What are you afraid of?

235
00:19:49.273 --> 00:19:50.566
What if it comes back?

236
00:19:50.649 --> 00:19:52.192
It won't come back.

237
00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:53.360
What if it does?

238
00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.696
If it comes back, we kill it.

239
00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.156
Code Red.

240
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.334
Come on, guys.

241
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:12.254
What about this place, then, Andy?

242
00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:14.256
Eh?

243
00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.383
Yeah, it's pretty good, Dad.

244
00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:27.978
Look at the camera.

245
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.938
This way.
That's good.

246
00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.567
There's 25 floors.

247
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.068
We get the penthouse up there.

248
00:20:35.152 --> 00:20:36.070
- Really?
- Really.

249
00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:37.696
I.D., sir.

250
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.240
- Thank you.
- So what do you do here, Dad?

251
00:20:40.324 --> 00:20:41.325
What do I do?

252
00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:42.576
I'm a section officer.

253
00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:44.119
I keep the lights on,

254
00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:45.829
the water running, the heat running.

255
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:48.416
See, that's what this says.

256
00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:51.751
Triple A... "access all areas."
That's me.

257
00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.587
I basically run the place, you know?

258
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.756
Well, you're the caretaker,
really, aren't you?

259
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.596
No, I run the place.

260
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.021
Wow!

261
00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:12.606
Like it?

262
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:13.690
It's amazing.

263
00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:15.734
What? Even better than sunny Spain?

264
00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.819
You ought to have seen
the refugee camps, Dad.

265
00:21:17.903 --> 00:21:20.697
There were 20 of us in each
tent and chemical toilets.

266
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:22.950
Oh.

267
00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:24.785
- Everything smelled of piss.
- Nice.

268
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.081
We'll be moving to
our new house soon,

269
00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:32.125
a couple of months, in fact.

270
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:33.502
A new house?

271
00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.712
Yeah.

272
00:21:38.215 --> 00:21:41.385
Listen, I hope you guys
understand, um...

273
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:45.389
we're not going to be able
to go back to our old house.

274
00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.432
It's outside the security zone,

275
00:21:47.516 --> 00:21:49.893
and anyway, I don't think
I'd want to go back there,

276
00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:52.938
even if I could.

277
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:56.399
What happened, Dad... to Mum?

278
00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.653
Yeah.

279
00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.283
Yeah.

280
00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:08.996
Do you want to sit down and
I'll tell you all about it?

281
00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:26.304
Your mum and I were
hiding in a house.

282
00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:30.184
A wee cottage.

283
00:22:34.563 --> 00:22:39.777
There was an old couple that...
owned it.

284
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.237
And they were there, too.

285
00:22:43.822 --> 00:22:45.949
Three other people.

286
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:50.078
And we were, uh...

287
00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:54.500
...just trying to
stay alive, I suppose.

288
00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:57.753
We were doing okay for a while.

289
00:22:57.836 --> 00:22:59.796
And then we were attacked.

290
00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:07.179
They came in
through the kitchen window.

291
00:23:07.262 --> 00:23:10.307
They were really fast, you know?

292
00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:15.020
Chased us.

293
00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:18.815
Chased your mum.

294
00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:22.944
And we were trapped.

295
00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:26.073
Trapped in the bedroom.

296
00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:27.908
Don!

297
00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:32.037
I s...

298
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.999
I seen them...

299
00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:39.502
biting...

300
00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:43.340
I couldn't do anything.

301
00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:51.640
I tried to go back.

302
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.728
She was already gone.

303
00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:04.903
She was already gone.

304
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:08.865
Was there nothing you could do?

305
00:24:10.951 --> 00:24:13.245
No, there was nothing I could do.

306
00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:20.043
I managed to get away.

307
00:24:22.254 --> 00:24:25.924
Just running, running and running.

308
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:33.932
I got to this military camp.

309
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.645
And you know the rest, you know,
I've been in quarantine,

310
00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:41.231
waiting for you guys to come back.

311
00:24:47.362 --> 00:24:50.574
We're just happy you're still alive.

312
00:25:06.715 --> 00:25:08.759
I'm sorry.

313
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.104
Doyle...

314
00:26:03.188 --> 00:26:06.024
Doyle, you bastard.

315
00:26:06.107 --> 00:26:07.901
Boy, I've never seen
you get so white.

316
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:09.360
- Come on.
- Oh, dude...

317
00:26:09.444 --> 00:26:10.695
Good morning.

318
00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:13.156
Get the fuck out of here, man.
I'm having all good dreams.

319
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.158
Yeah?

320
00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:17.411
Sunday afternoon, clear blue skies.

321
00:26:17.494 --> 00:26:20.747
I'm laying in bed with
my wife and... now I'm back

322
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.748
in this shit hole...

323
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:22.749
I know, man.

324
00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:24.334
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:26.419
I had that same dream
about your wife.

326
00:26:27.837 --> 00:26:28.921
Fucking with me.

327
00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:30.173
Get on out of here, cowboy.

328
00:26:30.257 --> 00:26:31.175
Yeah, all right.

329
00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:32.676
Next time I'm gonna
shoot you, though.

330
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:34.761
All right, see you later,
family man.

331
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:43.019
I told you I'm gonna shoot you.

332
00:27:15.343 --> 00:27:16.886
What's on the TV tonight?

333
00:28:42.263 --> 00:28:43.890
You okay?

334
00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:46.559
Bad dream?

335
00:28:49.646 --> 00:28:51.189
Hey...

336
00:28:51.272 --> 00:28:54.275
I get worried I'm going to
forget what she looks like.

337
00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:57.362
You won't forget.

338
00:28:57.445 --> 00:29:01.408
I don't even have a picture of her.

339
00:29:01.491 --> 00:29:03.910
You won't forget.

340
00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:10.000
Promise?

341
00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:11.793
Yeah.

342
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.762
<i>Andy, we agreed.</i>

343
00:29:22.846 --> 00:29:25.766
<i>You heard what they said: it's
only dogs and rats out there.</i>

344
00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:28.560
<i>We'll go home, we'll get what
we want and come back again.</i>

345
00:29:28.643 --> 00:29:30.103
<i>We should have told Dad.</i>

346
00:29:30.186 --> 00:29:31.562
<i>It's fine. Trust me.</i>

347
00:29:31.646 --> 00:29:33.648
<i>He won't even know we're gone.</i>

348
00:30:05.889 --> 00:30:08.016
Where are you going?

349
00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:11.978
Base, come in.

350
00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:13.271
Go.

351
00:30:13.354 --> 00:30:15.648
We have two strays that just
slipped out the north gate.

352
00:30:15.732 --> 00:30:18.026
- Stray dogs?
- No, puppies.

353
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.028
Yeah!

354
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:21.487
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

355
00:30:21.571 --> 00:30:23.198
- Yes!
- Yes!

356
00:30:24.282 --> 00:30:25.575
Whoo!

357
00:30:30.288 --> 00:30:31.915
Whoa...

358
00:30:36.878 --> 00:30:38.588
That's what we need.

359
00:30:40.423 --> 00:30:42.926
Yeah, if it had keys.

360
00:30:44.719 --> 00:30:46.429
Wait here.

361
00:32:03.506 --> 00:32:04.841
Let's go.

362
00:34:03.543 --> 00:34:05.545
There you go.

363
00:34:46.544 --> 00:34:48.337
Tam!

364
00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:53.843
Tam!

365
00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:58.264
Tam?

366
00:35:04.562 --> 00:35:06.481
Tam, are you there?

367
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.363
Tam?

368
00:35:13.446 --> 00:35:14.906
Tammy?

369
00:35:14.989 --> 00:35:16.866
Tammy?

370
00:35:54.403 --> 00:35:55.779
Tammy, this is stupid.

371
00:35:55.863 --> 00:35:57.073
You're not being funny.

372
00:36:22.765 --> 00:36:25.559
I knew it.

373
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:47.999
You're hurting me!

374
00:37:03.431 --> 00:37:05.767
No, don't go! No!

375
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.143
No!

376
00:37:20.323 --> 00:37:22.909
Doyle...

377
00:37:22.992 --> 00:37:25.870
I got your puppies.

378
00:37:41.969 --> 00:37:44.805
No!

379
00:37:49.352 --> 00:37:52.188
Get off me!

380
00:38:07.286 --> 00:38:10.539
I apologize for these precautions.

381
00:38:10.623 --> 00:38:14.335
It's standard protocol when
dealing with any survivors.

382
00:38:14.418 --> 00:38:16.295
Though we haven't had
to do it for a while.

383
00:38:16.379 --> 00:38:17.672
The last survivor
we came across

384
00:38:17.755 --> 00:38:20.007
was over two months ago.

385
00:38:21.926 --> 00:38:24.804
Can you tell me
anything about

386
00:38:24.887 --> 00:38:28.265
how you managed to...
keep... alive

387
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:30.560
while you were gone so long?

388
00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:36.857
Do you know of any other survivors?

389
00:38:40.903 --> 00:38:41.946
Okay.

390
00:38:43.447 --> 00:38:46.826
Just going to take a blood sample.

391
00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:48.119
It won't hurt.

392
00:38:58.504 --> 00:39:01.007
Have you come
into direct contact

393
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.967
with the infected?

394
00:39:12.852 --> 00:39:13.770
Okay.

395
00:39:24.196 --> 00:39:26.115
I want to see my children.

396
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.040
Of course. Of course.

397
00:39:53.434 --> 00:39:54.518
Mr. Harris.

398
00:39:54.602 --> 00:39:56.771
- Yeah.
- We found your kids.

399
00:39:56.854 --> 00:39:58.564
Oh, thank God, thank God.
Thank you so much.

400
00:39:58.647 --> 00:40:01.024
We found your wife, too.

401
00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:14.872
Can they hear me?

402
00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:17.124
So what did you two think
you were playing at?

403
00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:19.001
You said you saw her die.

404
00:40:19.085 --> 00:40:20.628
What?

405
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.504
You said you saw her die!

406
00:40:25.132 --> 00:40:26.592
I didn't say that.

407
00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:28.761
You did, you said
you saw her die, you did.

408
00:40:28.844 --> 00:40:30.096
Baby, I didn't use those words.

409
00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:31.472
This is...

410
00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:34.600
I don't know, I mean,
it's confusing, you know?

411
00:40:34.683 --> 00:40:38.437
It's very hard for you
to imagine, you know?

412
00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:39.731
It's-it's too hard to explain.

413
00:40:39.814 --> 00:40:42.566
Well, try to explain it, Dad, try!

414
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.569
Try? What do you want me to say?
I thought I saw Mom...

415
00:40:46.403 --> 00:40:47.362
die.

416
00:40:47.446 --> 00:40:49.490
I wouldn't have told you that...

417
00:40:49.573 --> 00:40:51.116
I was sure.

418
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.330
Guys, I'm not sure
what's happening here,

419
00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:58.624
but it's good.

420
00:40:58.707 --> 00:41:01.960
Okay? That's the point.

421
00:41:02.044 --> 00:41:03.128
Mom is alive.

422
00:41:03.212 --> 00:41:04.380
I want to see her!

423
00:41:42.334 --> 00:41:45.045
There's no question, sir.

424
00:41:45.129 --> 00:41:47.423
She has the virus.
She's infected.

425
00:41:50.009 --> 00:41:52.678
Why isn't she showing any symptoms?

426
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:53.845
I don't know.

427
00:41:53.929 --> 00:41:54.847
Speculate.

428
00:41:59.059 --> 00:42:01.687
<i>A genetic abnormality which acts</i>

429
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.605
as some sort of natural immunity.

430
00:42:03.689 --> 00:42:05.357
<i>But the virus
is still in her blood</i>

431
00:42:05.441 --> 00:42:06.692
and saliva, so...

432
00:42:06.775 --> 00:42:09.361
technically, she's not immune.

433
00:42:09.445 --> 00:42:11.113
She's a carrier.

434
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.450
Are you saying she has
the ability to infect others?

435
00:42:14.533 --> 00:42:15.909
Yes, sir.

436
00:42:15.993 --> 00:42:17.119
Absolutely.

437
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:23.042
If this woman has
natural immunity,

438
00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:24.710
she is incredibly valuable.

439
00:42:24.793 --> 00:42:27.463
Her blood could contain the
key to a vaccine, even a cure.

440
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.101
Alice?

441
00:42:43.562 --> 00:42:46.231
Hey, baby.

442
00:42:50.152 --> 00:42:51.528
Oh, I'm so sorry.

443
00:42:51.612 --> 00:42:53.364
I was scared.

444
00:42:56.659 --> 00:42:59.203
I shouldn't have run away.

445
00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:02.498
I was scared.

446
00:43:04.291 --> 00:43:07.669
Please forgive me.

447
00:43:07.753 --> 00:43:10.047
Please, sir, we need
some time to study her.

448
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:11.423
We need to run some tests.

449
00:43:11.507 --> 00:43:13.259
Run tests on her corpse, Major.

450
00:43:17.638 --> 00:43:21.183
I love you, Don.

451
00:43:26.438 --> 00:43:28.774
Yeah.

452
00:43:28.857 --> 00:43:32.861
Oh, God, I love you, too.

453
00:44:48.103 --> 00:44:49.479
Don!

454
00:45:06.789 --> 00:45:07.790
Help...

455
00:45:13.295 --> 00:45:15.005
Help me!

456
00:45:17.007 --> 00:45:20.385
Help me!

457
00:46:07.641 --> 00:46:10.686
Clear channels to control room.

458
00:46:10.769 --> 00:46:12.980
Control room,
this is General Stone.

459
00:46:13.063 --> 00:46:15.023
All forces under my control

460
00:46:15.107 --> 00:46:17.610
prepare to execute
Code Red on my command.

461
00:46:17.693 --> 00:46:18.902
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

462
00:46:18.986 --> 00:46:21.321
Break, break, break, all stations.

463
00:46:21.405 --> 00:46:23.324
Sunray in 30 seconds.

464
00:46:23.407 --> 00:46:24.450
We have an outbreak

465
00:46:24.533 --> 00:46:25.909
of the infection
in the medical center.

466
00:46:25.993 --> 00:46:27.328
All units safeties off.

467
00:46:27.411 --> 00:46:28.495
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

468
00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:29.621
Open air cap, transmission.

469
00:46:29.705 --> 00:46:31.331
Prepare designated
containment areas.

470
00:46:31.415 --> 00:46:32.333
Affirmative.

471
00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:35.085
Move civilians to containment areas.

472
00:46:35.169 --> 00:46:36.253
All command personnel
secure a bunker.

473
00:46:36.336 --> 00:46:38.380
Confirm order to lock down.

474
00:46:38.464 --> 00:46:40.549
Lock down confirmed.

475
00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:43.051
Execute Code Red.

476
00:46:48.182 --> 00:46:51.102
Flynn, come in.

477
00:46:51.185 --> 00:46:53.771
Flynn, did you hear that Code
Red or am I losing my shit?

478
00:46:53.854 --> 00:46:56.565
Just about to ask you
the same thing.

479
00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:00.069
Ten hut!

480
00:47:21.381 --> 00:47:22.799
Everything's fine.

481
00:47:22.883 --> 00:47:24.927
Don't worry.
I'll be back in a moment.

482
00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:29.848
It's probably nothing.

483
00:47:29.932 --> 00:47:31.600
Tam, it didn't sound like nothing.

484
00:47:31.683 --> 00:47:34.603
He said he'd be back in a moment.

485
00:48:08.971 --> 00:48:10.139
You okay?

486
00:48:10.222 --> 00:48:11.682
Let's go.

487
00:48:14.476 --> 00:48:15.477
Come on.

488
00:48:18.355 --> 00:48:20.357
Move, move, move!
Let's go! Let's go!

489
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.109
Andy, keep hold of my hand!

490
00:48:22.192 --> 00:48:24.486
Okay, come on, keep it going.
Keep it moving.

491
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.572
Come on, people. Come on,
people. Come on, now.

492
00:48:26.655 --> 00:48:28.574
Don't push.
No pushing.

493
00:48:28.657 --> 00:48:30.033
Sir, all civilians
into the containment area.

494
00:48:30.117 --> 00:48:31.452
- No, these kids are with me.
- Sir...

495
00:48:31.535 --> 00:48:33.787
It's incredibly important
that they are kept protected.

496
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.123
I need to get them out
of here immediately.

497
00:48:36.206 --> 00:48:37.290
Sir, no exceptions.

498
00:48:37.374 --> 00:48:38.584
- It's a Code Red.
- I know what it is.

499
00:48:38.667 --> 00:48:39.751
These kids are with me.
My name is...

500
00:48:39.835 --> 00:48:42.463
- Andy!
- Scarlet!

501
00:48:42.546 --> 00:48:44.965
- Andy!
- Tammy!

502
00:48:45.048 --> 00:48:46.508
- Andy!
- Andy, wait!

503
00:48:46.592 --> 00:48:48.260
- Scarlet!
- Just wait, Andy!

504
00:48:48.343 --> 00:48:50.428
- We're coming!
- Calm down. Calm down, now!

505
00:48:59.271 --> 00:49:02.107
Move down, move down the room.
Keep moving.

506
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.067
Go, go, go. Come on.

507
00:49:08.655 --> 00:49:10.115
Keep moving. That's it.

508
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:13.035
Hey, why are you
shutting us inside here?

509
00:49:13.118 --> 00:49:14.494
For your own protection!

510
00:49:14.578 --> 00:49:16.955
Well, just close the door!
You don't need to lock it!

511
00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:18.790
It's for your own protection!

512
00:49:18.874 --> 00:49:20.125
We've got to find Andy.

513
00:49:20.208 --> 00:49:21.543
It's okay.
We'll find him.

514
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.945
Shut down civilian areas.

515
00:49:48.028 --> 00:49:49.613
Sector One locked down.

516
00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:51.031
Sector Eight locked down.

517
00:49:51.114 --> 00:49:53.742
Sector Three locked down.

518
00:50:10.092 --> 00:50:12.761
Switch to emergency lighting.

519
00:50:12.844 --> 00:50:16.389
Use of non-lethal force authorized.

520
00:50:16.473 --> 00:50:18.475
- All snipers in position.
- Roger that.

521
00:50:18.558 --> 00:50:22.145
Ground forces to med center.
Ground force to med center.

522
00:50:24.064 --> 00:50:26.984
- Sector One covered.
- Where's my spotter?

523
00:50:33.073 --> 00:50:34.616
Girls, stay calm.

524
00:50:57.264 --> 00:50:58.098
Dad.

525
00:51:17.159 --> 00:51:19.995
My dad! My dad!

526
00:51:20.078 --> 00:51:21.997
He's in here!

527
00:52:30.899 --> 00:52:32.359
No...!

528
00:52:45.914 --> 00:52:48.417
No!

529
00:53:01.388 --> 00:53:04.600
Confirm: Only target infected.

530
00:53:04.683 --> 00:53:06.184
Roger that.
Only target infected.

531
00:53:14.776 --> 00:53:16.945
Targeting right.
I got two down.

532
00:53:21.283 --> 00:53:22.534
Watch out for the friendlies.

533
00:53:22.617 --> 00:53:23.952
Watch out for the friendlies.

534
00:53:24.035 --> 00:53:25.453
I can't get a shot.

535
00:53:28.123 --> 00:53:30.834
Oh, man, this is FUBAR.

536
00:53:32.168 --> 00:53:35.046
We got a group
there at twelve o'clock.

537
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:37.382
I've got three on the ground.

538
00:53:37.465 --> 00:53:39.384
Got four on the ground.
Got four.

539
00:53:42.554 --> 00:53:43.722
16 down.

540
00:53:47.142 --> 00:53:49.311
I got two by the jeep.

541
00:53:53.106 --> 00:53:54.941
Jesus!

542
00:53:55.025 --> 00:53:56.443
I don't see who's a target.

543
00:54:00.405 --> 00:54:02.616
On the move! On the move!
On the move!

544
00:54:02.699 --> 00:54:04.576
Move it right! Move it right!

545
00:54:04.659 --> 00:54:06.995
I can't find
another damn target here.

546
00:54:09.414 --> 00:54:10.999
I can't get a shot.

547
00:54:11.082 --> 00:54:13.418
Whiskey Three,
why have you stopped firing?

548
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:14.794
Come in, Whiskey Three.

549
00:54:15.879 --> 00:54:17.839
Abandon selective targeting.

550
00:54:17.923 --> 00:54:19.507
Shoot everything.
Targets are now free.

551
00:54:19.591 --> 00:54:21.092
I cannot contain spreading.

552
00:54:21.176 --> 00:54:23.679
We've lost control.

553
00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:30.060
All units, all units,

554
00:54:30.143 --> 00:54:32.979
this is Medical Commanding
Officer Sierra Lima.

555
00:54:35.106 --> 00:54:39.527
Please be on the lookout for
a young boy, age 12, name Andy.

556
00:54:41.613 --> 00:54:45.534
If he is located, he must
be immediately evacuated

557
00:54:45.617 --> 00:54:46.868
from the containment zone.

558
00:54:46.952 --> 00:54:49.288
We have to find Andy.

559
00:54:49.371 --> 00:54:51.039
We have to find him!

560
00:54:51.122 --> 00:54:53.500
It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna find him.

561
00:54:53.583 --> 00:54:55.293
I'm gonna find him, I promise.

562
00:54:55.377 --> 00:54:57.128
I'm gonna get him out of here.

563
00:54:57.212 --> 00:54:59.130
I'm gonna get you both out of here.

564
00:54:59.214 --> 00:55:01.466
Trust me.

565
00:55:22.612 --> 00:55:23.655
Which shot?

566
00:55:23.738 --> 00:55:24.990
Abandon selective targeting.

567
00:55:25.073 --> 00:55:26.866
All targets are now free.

568
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:29.077
What? Confirm order.

569
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.955
Rooftop units,
target everyone at ground level.

570
00:55:32.038 --> 00:55:33.665
No exceptions.

571
00:55:33.748 --> 00:55:36.000
Repeat: no exceptions.

572
00:55:44.217 --> 00:55:45.427
Run!

573
00:56:02.819 --> 00:56:04.904
Three down!
One of ours down there!

574
00:56:04.988 --> 00:56:06.865
Three o'clock!

575
00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:21.379
Taking 'em down,
taking 'em down.

576
00:56:21.463 --> 00:56:22.839
That's it, at three o'clock!

577
00:56:27.635 --> 00:56:30.096
Kid! Over here!

578
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.683
Kid! Over here!

579
00:56:46.529 --> 00:56:48.740
Take 'em out! Take 'em out!

580
00:56:48.823 --> 00:56:51.951
I got two fuckers on me.
Doyle, I got two fuckers on me!

581
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.207
Fuck.

582
00:57:10.637 --> 00:57:12.139
Fuck!

583
00:58:02.605 --> 00:58:05.817
Shh, shh, shh.

584
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.027
It's all right. It's all right.

585
00:58:09.237 --> 00:58:11.239
Shh, shh, shh.

586
00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:27.213
Tam?

587
00:58:46.941 --> 00:58:50.027
This is madness.

588
00:58:51.154 --> 00:58:52.572
What's happening?

589
00:58:52.655 --> 00:58:53.907
They're shooting everybody.

590
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.325
Why?

591
00:58:55.408 --> 00:58:56.993
It makes no sense.

592
00:58:57.076 --> 00:58:58.953
It makes perfect sense.

593
00:58:59.996 --> 00:59:02.332
It's Code Red.

594
00:59:14.719 --> 00:59:16.804
I saw Dad.

595
00:59:16.888 --> 00:59:19.349
Where?

596
00:59:19.432 --> 00:59:21.476
He's one of them.

597
00:59:22.852 --> 00:59:26.647
Step one: kill the infected.

598
00:59:26.731 --> 00:59:30.109
Step two: containment.

599
00:59:30.193 --> 00:59:33.613
If containment fails...

600
00:59:33.696 --> 00:59:37.283
step three: extermination.

601
00:59:37.367 --> 00:59:40.078
And now they won't stop
until everyone is dead.

602
00:59:41.287 --> 00:59:43.873
So what do we do?

603
00:59:43.957 --> 00:59:49.420
I mean, I'm not sitting around
hereto get exterminated.

604
00:59:49.504 --> 00:59:51.130
We've got to get out of here.

605
00:59:51.214 --> 00:59:53.842
If we take one step
out of that door,

606
00:59:53.925 --> 00:59:57.262
if the infected don't get us,
the snipers will.

607
00:59:57.345 --> 01:00:00.431
Well, you don't have
a choice, my friend.

608
01:00:00.515 --> 01:00:02.350
Right now it's dark out there.

609
01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:06.062
The snipers can see through
their night scopes, but...

610
01:00:06.145 --> 01:00:08.939
at least you have some limited
cover from the infected.

611
01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:12.610
But, you know,
if you want to wait till sunup,

612
01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:14.487
then you're as good as dead.

613
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:18.032
Who are you?

614
01:00:18.116 --> 01:00:20.744
Sergeant Doyle, Delta, Rooftop Unit.

615
01:00:20.827 --> 01:00:22.537
Why aren't you at your post?

616
01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.372
Why aren't you?

617
01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:30.795
Look, you guys do
what you want, but, uh...

618
01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:33.631
I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.

619
01:00:33.715 --> 01:00:35.634
You coming?

620
01:00:41.848 --> 01:00:44.142
'Kay, come on.

621
01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:55.152
There's less shooting.

622
01:00:55.236 --> 01:00:57.905
Maybe they've got it under control.

623
01:00:57.989 --> 01:00:59.407
Or less shooters.

624
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.118
All right, listen,
I need you guys

625
01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:04.829
to look at me and only me, okay?

626
01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:06.163
You run when I run.

627
01:01:06.247 --> 01:01:07.999
Be my shadow, that's it, right?

628
01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:09.250
Get around back.

629
01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:12.045
Watch her.

630
01:01:12.128 --> 01:01:13.671
Ready?

631
01:01:13.755 --> 01:01:15.423
Let's go.

632
01:01:24.474 --> 01:01:26.726
Stay.

633
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:33.399
Doyle, come in.

634
01:01:38.237 --> 01:01:39.989
Then go.

635
01:01:40.073 --> 01:01:41.574
Doyle, where the fuck are you, man?

636
01:01:44.035 --> 01:01:46.579
Ground level,

637
01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:47.663
District One.

638
01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:49.499
Shit! Closed frequency.

639
01:01:49.582 --> 01:01:50.583
Copy that.

640
01:01:53.169 --> 01:01:56.089
What the fuck are you doing there?

641
01:01:56.172 --> 01:01:58.800
Listen to me, you've got some
serious shit coming your way.

642
01:01:58.883 --> 01:02:00.927
We've already got some serious shit.

643
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.345
No. I'm not fucking playing;
this is worse.

644
01:02:02.428 --> 01:02:04.013
The air cav,
they just got their orders.

645
01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:05.056
They're firebombing

646
01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.265
all of District One.

647
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:08.685
That was fast.

648
01:02:08.768 --> 01:02:10.686
Outbreak is out of control.
They're taking no chances.

649
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.438
So unless you are
out of the target zone,

650
01:02:12.522 --> 01:02:15.400
you are getting cooked, you got me?

651
01:02:15.483 --> 01:02:16.442
How long we got?

652
01:02:16.526 --> 01:02:17.444
They're already on their way.

653
01:02:17.527 --> 01:02:18.444
You got four minutes, tops.

654
01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:19.612
But listen, I got some

655
01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:21.113
clear landing ground
at Regents Park.

656
01:02:21.197 --> 01:02:23.116
That's the pickup point.
Got it?

657
01:02:23.199 --> 01:02:24.951
I'll be back in touch.

658
01:02:25.034 --> 01:02:29.121
Hey, Doyle, you fuckin' better be.

659
01:02:29.205 --> 01:02:31.165
All right, look, guys,
we got to run, okay?

660
01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:32.583
Just stay low and stay fast.

661
01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.502
Okay? After me.
Let's go.

662
01:02:42.218 --> 01:02:43.219
Sniper!

663
01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:44.637
- Back! Back! Back!
- Get down! Sniper!

664
01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:47.724
Get back! Get back!

665
01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:52.562
- Back!
- Andy, get in!

666
01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:58.776
It's okay.

667
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.446
It's just a flesh wound.

668
01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:11.873
All right.

669
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:18.630
Multiple shots, one hit.

670
01:03:18.713 --> 01:03:22.008
He's panicked, and no marksman.

671
01:03:27.096 --> 01:03:28.472
All right.

672
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:32.268
- What's your name?
- Sam.

673
01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:34.603
Hey, Sam. Get close.

674
01:03:34.687 --> 01:03:36.314
You see that doorway?

675
01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:38.274
I need you to run
as fast as you can

676
01:03:38.357 --> 01:03:39.567
in a zigzag like this, okay?

677
01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:42.278
And don't stop for anything, okay?

678
01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:43.445
You want me to be bait.

679
01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:44.530
No, no.
Look, he's gonna

680
01:03:44.614 --> 01:03:45.907
take shots at you, all right?

681
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:47.992
But he's gonna miss.

682
01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.327
All right? He's gonna
expose his position.

683
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:51.537
It means I get a shot at
him, and I won't miss.

684
01:03:51.621 --> 01:03:53.289
You're out of your fucking mind.

685
01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:55.208
- There's no way I'm going out there.
- Stay back.

686
01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:57.919
Two minutes, we're all gonna die.

687
01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.838
You want that?

688
01:04:00.922 --> 01:04:02.841
- No!
- Andy!

689
01:04:03.925 --> 01:04:04.968
Fuck!

690
01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:32.787
Good work, kid.

691
01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:41.128
The fence!
Watch it, watch it!

692
01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:42.171
Behind me.

693
01:04:42.255 --> 01:04:43.757
Go! Go!

694
01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:44.506
Go!

695
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.178
Come on.

696
01:04:48.261 --> 01:04:49.763
Come on, come on.

697
01:04:49.845 --> 01:04:50.971
Jump!

698
01:05:08.823 --> 01:05:10.825
This is Red Fox One pouring whiskey.

699
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.955
Keep going.
We'll be safe under the river.

700
01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:03.646
Go! Go!

701
01:07:06.607 --> 01:07:08.442
Come on! Come on!

702
01:07:14.949 --> 01:07:17.285
Run! Run!

703
01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:33.509
Bring in bio-soldier units.

704
01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:35.886
Fan out to the
predesignated positions.

705
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:39.182
Bio units, copy.

706
01:07:39.265 --> 01:07:41.184
Use of chemical weapons authorized.

707
01:07:41.267 --> 01:07:42.351
Repeat: all units,

708
01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:44.437
chemical weapons are authorized.

709
01:10:38.527 --> 01:10:40.529
Stay close.

710
01:10:58.964 --> 01:11:01.091
They left us again.

711
01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:07.222
Do you think Mum's still alive?

712
01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:12.269
Not this time.

713
01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:47.429
You look a little pale.

714
01:11:47.513 --> 01:11:48.973
Blood makes me nauseous.

715
01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:51.475
You never answered my question.

716
01:11:53.477 --> 01:11:54.937
About why you left your post.

717
01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:58.190
I got that boy in my sights.

718
01:12:01.819 --> 01:12:04.905
He's not a target anymore.

719
01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:12.370
When we were separated...

720
01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:15.582
I thought I'd lost you, too.

721
01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:20.546
We won't get separated again.

722
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:23.090
We'll stay together,
whatever happens.

723
01:12:25.134 --> 01:12:26.969
Whatever happens.

724
01:12:27.052 --> 01:12:29.054
It's all fucked.

725
01:12:32.933 --> 01:12:34.935
You hear it all over
the radios... fucked.

726
01:12:42.276 --> 01:12:45.696
Anyway...
what about you?

727
01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:47.740
Why the hell are you here?

728
01:12:47.823 --> 01:12:50.617
Their mother...

729
01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:54.246
had very special blood.

730
01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:57.332
Natural kind of immunity
to the virus.

731
01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:05.132
Not all genetic traits
are passed on, you know.

732
01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:09.136
They can skip a generation
or vanish altogether, but...

733
01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.138
But they might have it.

734
01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:14.182
It's a possibility.

735
01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:20.898
So their lives are
far more valuable than mine.

736
01:13:24.151 --> 01:13:25.653
Or yours.

737
01:13:28.655 --> 01:13:30.073
I got it.

738
01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:33.077
Doyle!

739
01:13:35.704 --> 01:13:36.663
Doyle!

740
01:13:36.747 --> 01:13:37.915
Flynn, go.

741
01:13:37.998 --> 01:13:39.875
You made it.

742
01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.168
I knew you'd do it, buddy.

743
01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.836
Listen, I am coming
to you right now,

744
01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.630
but keep a lookout, okay?

745
01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:46.298
There's confirmed sightings
of infected

746
01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:48.174
that have escaped the fire bombings.

747
01:13:48.258 --> 01:13:49.259
Give me an ETA.

748
01:13:49.343 --> 01:13:50.886
About 60.

749
01:13:50.969 --> 01:13:51.887
Minutes?

750
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:53.221
No.

751
01:13:53.305 --> 01:13:54.389
Seconds.

752
01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:57.559
Kids, come on!

753
01:14:02.815 --> 01:14:03.941
Get down.

754
01:14:04.024 --> 01:14:06.527
Get down! Get down.

755
01:14:27.047 --> 01:14:28.549
I see you!

756
01:14:28.632 --> 01:14:30.259
Coming in!

757
01:14:30.342 --> 01:14:32.511
Jesus, Doyle,
you got people with you.

758
01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:33.971
Who the fuck are those people?!

759
01:14:48.902 --> 01:14:49.778
Doyle!

760
01:14:49.862 --> 01:14:52.239
Who the fuck are those people?!

761
01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:53.573
I can't take them!

762
01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:56.076
We will get shot out of
the sky if I try to land...

763
01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.287
No, no, don't take them to base!

764
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:59.413
Take them over the channel!

765
01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:00.747
What?!

766
01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.791
You got to get these kids
out of here, Flynn!

767
01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:05.002
Get the fuck in, Doyle!
I'm not taking them!

768
01:15:05.085 --> 01:15:07.045
- I'm not leaving them!
- Get me out of here!

769
01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:11.133
Hey! Get him off of there!

770
01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:12.509
Get the fuck off...!

771
01:15:13.302 --> 01:15:14.929
Okay.

772
01:15:16.388 --> 01:15:19.892
- Stop!
- Come on!

773
01:15:35.407 --> 01:15:36.408
Flynn, we're gonna fucking

774
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:37.659
die down here!
Do something!

775
01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:44.500
Come on, you fuckers.

776
01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:55.260
Get up, get up, get up!

777
01:15:55.344 --> 01:15:56.470
Run! Move it!

778
01:16:17.157 --> 01:16:18.575
Don't look back!

779
01:16:18.659 --> 01:16:19.660
Keep going!

780
01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:23.163
Keep going.

781
01:16:30.796 --> 01:16:32.298
Fuck you.

782
01:16:50.274 --> 01:16:51.358
Doyle, come in!

783
01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:54.444
Doyle! You need to get
to safe ground!

784
01:16:54.528 --> 01:16:55.446
Get to the stadium!

785
01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:56.447
Ditch those people!

786
01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:57.698
I'm not taking them.

787
01:17:10.836 --> 01:17:12.588
Flynn, come in.

788
01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:14.339
Flynn, goddamn it,
I know you can hear me.

789
01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:16.383
Fuck the Code Red.
Fuck the chain of command.

790
01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:18.343
I'm stuck out here and need
an extraction, goddamn it.

791
01:17:18.427 --> 01:17:20.804
Better fucking be there,
because we will be.

792
01:17:20.887 --> 01:17:22.472
Hey, you okay?

793
01:17:22.556 --> 01:17:23.974
Yeah?

794
01:17:24.057 --> 01:17:25.308
Bet you're tired, huh?

795
01:17:25.392 --> 01:17:26.351
Me, too.

796
01:17:26.435 --> 01:17:27.978
Look, I need you to help me, okay?

797
01:17:28.061 --> 01:17:29.062
Help me with your sister.

798
01:17:29.146 --> 01:17:30.064
You got that?

799
01:17:31.398 --> 01:17:32.357
Come on, got to go.

800
01:17:32.441 --> 01:17:34.860
Got to go.
Go, go, go, go, go!

801
01:18:02.262 --> 01:18:03.847
Gas! Get back!

802
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.515
Get back! Come on!

803
01:18:05.599 --> 01:18:06.683
It's gas!

804
01:18:06.767 --> 01:18:07.810
- Get in the car!
- Run!

805
01:18:07.893 --> 01:18:09.353
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

806
01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:11.688
Get in the car!
Get in the car! Hurry up!

807
01:18:11.772 --> 01:18:14.566
Come on, come on, get in, get in!

808
01:18:16.068 --> 01:18:18.696
Get in!

809
01:18:18.779 --> 01:18:20.489
Go, go, go!

810
01:18:28.914 --> 01:18:30.582
Get the vents! Get the vents!

811
01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:13.917
It won't start!

812
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.585
We're gonna be fine, all right?

813
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:16.753
Just keep trying.

814
01:19:16.837 --> 01:19:18.505
- Keep trying!
- It won't start!

815
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:28.056
Come on. Come on! Come on!

816
01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.933
Keep trying! Keep trying!

817
01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.267
It won't start!

818
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:33.061
- It won't fucking start!
- Fuck me.

819
01:19:36.356 --> 01:19:38.233
It won't start.

820
01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:39.484
Put your foot on the clutch.

821
01:19:41.653 --> 01:19:43.947
All right, pop the clutch
when I tell you, okay?

822
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.157
You get them to the stadium.

823
01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.284
Okay?

824
01:19:51.496 --> 01:19:52.872
Keep your head down.

825
01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:00.380
I'll meet you there.

826
01:20:06.761 --> 01:20:08.888
Doyle!

827
01:20:21.067 --> 01:20:23.361
Pop it!

828
01:20:23.445 --> 01:20:25.072
Pop it!

829
01:20:26.406 --> 01:20:27.198
Go!

830
01:20:30.285 --> 01:20:31.620
Go...!

831
01:20:48.762 --> 01:20:51.807
Oh, my God!

832
01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:14.120
Okay.

833
01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:52.826
Scarlet!

834
01:21:57.581 --> 01:21:59.541
They're shooting at us!

835
01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:32.865
Okay, let's go!

836
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.045
Go on through here, guys.

837
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:04.230
Just hold onto the rails.

838
01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.862
Careful, guys.

839
01:23:14.574 --> 01:23:15.825
Okay.

840
01:23:17.869 --> 01:23:19.412
It's okay. I can see.
I can see.

841
01:23:19.496 --> 01:23:22.165
Just keep going down.

842
01:23:28.797 --> 01:23:30.674
Okay.

843
01:23:30.757 --> 01:23:34.302
Keep walking
straight, guys,

844
01:23:34.386 --> 01:23:35.971
holding against the wall.

845
01:23:36.054 --> 01:23:37.722
You're doing really well.

846
01:23:37.806 --> 01:23:38.849
You're doing great.

847
01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:41.017
Okay, get back, get back!

848
01:23:41.101 --> 01:23:43.020
Against the wall!

849
01:23:43.103 --> 01:23:44.146
Okay, good.

850
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:46.648
Just stay close.

851
01:23:46.731 --> 01:23:50.151
Slightly to the right, Andy.

852
01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:51.153
It's okay.

853
01:23:51.236 --> 01:23:52.863
I know... I can see.
It's okay.

854
01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:54.155
I've got the night sight on.

855
01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:56.199
You're doing great.
Just hold, hold the rail.

856
01:23:56.282 --> 01:23:59.077
Nice and slow down the stairs, okay?

857
01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.495
Stop, stop, stop!

858
01:24:00.578 --> 01:24:02.163
Right now!

859
01:24:02.247 --> 01:24:03.623
Okay, Tammy, to your left.

860
01:24:03.707 --> 01:24:05.542
Good. Okay.

861
01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:06.626
Good girl, just straight...

862
01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:08.628
Now, nice and slow.
Slower.

863
01:24:08.712 --> 01:24:10.339
Stop! Stop! Stop, honey!

864
01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:12.174
It's okay!
It's okay!

865
01:24:12.257 --> 01:24:13.633
It's okay, all right?

866
01:24:13.717 --> 01:24:16.428
Grab ahold of
the other railing, okay?

867
01:24:17.679 --> 01:24:18.888
Scarlet, I can't see anything!

868
01:24:18.972 --> 01:24:20.390
Okay, go to your right.

869
01:24:20.473 --> 01:24:22.392
Go to your right.

870
01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:23.810
All right, try and skip...

871
01:24:23.893 --> 01:24:26.771
Just-just put your leg
far out in front of you, okay?

872
01:24:26.855 --> 01:24:28.523
Good girl.
Hold onto the rail.

873
01:24:28.606 --> 01:24:30.483
Careful!

874
01:24:35.155 --> 01:24:38.408
Andy! Where are you?!

875
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:46.791
Andy! Where are you, Andy?!

876
01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:48.001
Answer me!

877
01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:50.962
Where are you?!

878
01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:56.843
Tammy!

879
01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:00.805
Where are you?!

880
01:25:00.889 --> 01:25:02.057
Scarlet!

881
01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.641
Tammy, I'm coming!
I'm right here!

882
01:25:03.725 --> 01:25:04.809
Scarlet, I've lost Andy.

883
01:25:04.893 --> 01:25:06.603
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm right here.

884
01:25:06.686 --> 01:25:07.604
I've lost Andy.

885
01:25:07.687 --> 01:25:09.105
It's okay.

886
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:10.482
There you go.

887
01:25:10.565 --> 01:25:12.692
Just slowly, towards me...

888
01:25:12.776 --> 01:25:14.111
I lost Andy.

889
01:25:15.862 --> 01:25:18.698
We'll find Andy.

890
01:25:26.623 --> 01:25:28.166
Scarlet!

891
01:25:39.636 --> 01:25:41.263
Andy!

892
01:25:41.346 --> 01:25:42.848
Where are you?!

893
01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:03.075
Scarlet.

894
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:18.508
Tammy?

895
01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:19.759
Tammy?!

896
01:26:19.843 --> 01:26:23.221
Scarlet?!

897
01:26:49.747 --> 01:26:51.832
No!

898
01:26:55.336 --> 01:26:56.504
Don't!

899
01:27:55.104 --> 01:27:56.480
We stay together,

900
01:27:56.564 --> 01:27:57.732
whatever happens.

901
01:27:57.815 --> 01:27:59.400
No!

902
01:27:59.484 --> 01:28:00.944
Andy!

903
01:28:01.027 --> 01:28:03.112
Andy, no!

904
01:28:03.196 --> 01:28:04.531
No, Andy!

905
01:28:08.534 --> 01:28:11.037
Andy! Andy!

906
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.080
No!

907
01:28:13.164 --> 01:28:14.916
No!

908
01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:17.585
Andy!

909
01:28:47.448 --> 01:28:49.450
Tammy, am I one of them?

910
01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.922
No.

911
01:29:07.385 --> 01:29:09.304
No, you're not.

912
01:30:12.283 --> 01:30:14.285
Stop!

913
01:30:16.621 --> 01:30:18.206
Where's Doyle?

914
01:30:21.626 --> 01:30:22.877
Where's Doyle?!

915
01:30:30.676 --> 01:30:32.344
It's just us.

916
01:30:47.193 --> 01:30:49.779
Come on.

917
01:30:49.862 --> 01:30:50.988
Get in.

918
01:30:51.072 --> 01:30:52.031
Come on!

919
01:32:57.031 --> 01:32:59.033
We need your help.
