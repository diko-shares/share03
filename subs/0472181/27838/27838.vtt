1
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:03,358
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,296
For 5 years I was stranded on
an island with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:10,064
to survive.

4
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,565
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,101
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,287
to use the list of names
he left me

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,439
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,576
To do this,
I must become someone else.

9
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:26,413
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:27,965
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:30,117
The company Mrs. Queen
invested in doesn't exist.

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,086
Tempest purchased
a warehouse in Starling City.

13
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:35,189
Oliver, this is
my daughter, Helena.

14
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:37,240
The Starling City
vigilante comes and goes

15
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:38,560
as he pleases, doesn't he?

16
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,727
How did you know?

17
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:43,096
The minute I saw your eyes.

18
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:44,398
It's your fault
Michael's dead.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,765
Not your father
for ordering the hit

20
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,472
or me for carrying it out.

21
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:48,787
That island changed you
in ways that

22
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:50,438
only someone like me
can understand.

23
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,457
I know it feels like
justice, but it's not.

24
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:54,942
Revenge is justice.

25
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:57,777
You feel the same as I do.
I know it.

26
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:31,471
Take your hands off me!

27
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:32,806
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

28
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,041
That man was the leader
of the Triad.

29
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,895
My father blames them
for the recent hits against his men.

30
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:39,379
These are men you killed.

31
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,814
That's right.

32
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:43,350
I take out Zhishan
and the Triad retaliates.

33
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:45,819
I have weakened my father's
organization to the point

34
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:48,155
where there is no way that
he can survive their onslaught.

35
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,691
What, and then you'll
have your revenge?

36
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:52,910
Then I have justice,

37
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,612
for what he did
to Michael and me.

38
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,564
It's not justice.

39
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,783
And what you do is?

40
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:02,035
Would you let me show you?

41
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:09,710
Get you anything else?

42
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,461
No, thank you, Carly.

43
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,846
Where's my brother-in-law?

44
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:14,715
It's late and this
is the Glades.

45
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,049
Shouldn't he
be keeping you safe?

46
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,418
She is tougher
than she looks.

47
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:26,593
I haven't been on a second
date in a while.

48
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:28,445
It feels good so far.

49
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:31,882
Look, um, we slept together,

50
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:34,451
and it was really nice.

51
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:37,604
And I needed it.
But I'm not looking for anything.

52
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:39,606
Right. Because you have
everything figured out.

53
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,058
I don't think
you're one to judge.

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,492
I saw you kill people,
remember?

55
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:43,794
I only kill people

56
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:46,246
when it is
absolutely necessary.

57
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:47,547
It's not
my opening move.

58
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:48,882
And the way
that you're going,

59
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:50,550
you're gonna get
somebody hurt,

60
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:51,902
like my mother
or yourself.

61
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:53,620
I'm sorry about your mother.

62
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,255
That was an accident.

63
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:56,890
How many more accidents
have to happen

64
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:59,509
before you're done
getting back at your father?

65
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:01,595
Hopefully none.

66
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:03,847
I am not getting back
at him.

67
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,755
I--I am stripping away

68
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,235
everything that
has meaning to him,

69
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:09,302
just like he did to me
when he had Michael killed.

70
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:10,954
What if I could show you
another way,

71
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:13,640
a way you could take down
your father's organization

72
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:17,444
without putting innocent
people at risk?

73
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:22,282
Thank you

74
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:24,334
for the coffee...

75
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:25,819
and the sex.

76
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:28,488
But I'm not interested.

77
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:35,829
I don't know where
the next Olympics are at,

78
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:39,132
but you might want
to think about signing yourself up.

79
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:43,020
So, you want to talk
about last night?

80
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:46,773
Okay. Last time
you and I spoke,

81
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,925
you were on your way
to stop Helena Bertinelli

82
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,344
from her one-woman war
against the Mafia.

83
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:52,896
How'd that work out
for you?

84
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,649
Nick Salvati,
Frank Bertinelli's right hand,

85
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,350
was found
with his neck snapped

86
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,185
along with a few
of his thugs.

87
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:00,787
Was that her or you?

88
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:03,356
I was with Helena
when somebody jumped us.

89
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:05,042
We didn't have a choice.

90
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,159
We?

91
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,828
She knows, Diggle,
about me.

92
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,529
It was my secret
or her life.

93
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:12,699
It's not just your secret
anymore, Oliver.

94
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,634
This woman is a killer. She's been
dropping bodies all over the city.

95
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:16,703
Diggle, she's not
what you think she is.

96
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:19,339
3 years ago she was gonna
turn her father in to the FBI.

97
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,508
She put everything
she had on him on a laptop.

98
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,261
Her father found it,
thought it belonged to her fiance,

99
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:26,063
and had him murdered.

100
00:05:28,232 --> 00:05:30,984
All right, listen,
that's a heavy thing, man.

101
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:33,553
But it doesn't change
the fact that she is dangerous.

102
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:36,189
And if Bertinelli
retaliates against the Triad

103
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:39,392
or is perceived to, the Triad
is gonna rain down hell

104
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:41,394
and innocent people
are gonna be killed.

105
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:43,363
She's lost, Diggle,

106
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:47,066
and whether she
knows it or not, I can save her,

107
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:49,252
stop her from
doing anything reckless.

108
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:50,921
That's just it.
You can't save her, okay?

109
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:52,255
Some people don't change.

110
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:53,623
I can.

111
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,958
I can help her.

112
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,676
All right.

113
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:59,212
Maybe you think you're more
persuasive than you are,

114
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:01,848
or maybe she thinks
she's fine the way she is

115
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,266
on her mission
of righteous fury.

116
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:04,851
Whatever it is,
either way,

117
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:07,771
all of this,
it ends badly.

118
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:09,773
Either way...

119
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,614
I got to try.

120

121
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,640
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

122
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:32,101
Where are you off to so early?
You just got home.

123
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:33,953
The trouble with traveling
overseas for a few weeks

124
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,938
is that a few weeks' worth
of work is piling up on my desk.

125
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,407
I just want to start digging
my way out from underneath it.

126
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,792
Of course.

127
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:46,666
What is it?

128
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,255
We haven't spoken
since you left.

129
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:54,974
Really spoken.

130
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,425
I know.

131
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:59,228
Well, I can imagine
finding out

132
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,963
that I had Robert's
yacht salvaged

133
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:05,634
and that he was murdered,
it was a lot for you to take in.

134
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,438
Yes, it was.

135
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,020
I just don't want you

136
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:13,101
to feel that you can't
trust me anymore.

137
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:17,246
I wasn't lying to--
to hurt you,

138
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:19,048
but to keep you safe.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,201
I haven't changed,
Walter.

140
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:26,655
I'm still the woman
you fell in love with and married.

141
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:28,841
Do you see that?

142
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,293
Yeah.

143
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,794
Of course I do.

144
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,217
I just want us to agree

145
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:38,217
to be honest with
one another, moving forward.

146
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,186
Okay.
Yes, of course.

147
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:42,939
Walter.

148
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:45,674
Will you give me
a lift to school?

149
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:47,860
I like to mix it up sometimes
and actually be on time.

150
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:51,531
That would be
my parental privilege.

151
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,866
Or, you know, you could just
buy me a convertible

152
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,618
and then we could avoid this.

153
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,321
What, and miss out on all
those wonderful conversations

154
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:01,874
we have in the car?
I don't think so.

155
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:05,861
I'm so sorry, Frank.
The last thing you need

156
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,863
is me crying on your
shoulder all night.

157
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:10,866
I just can't believe
that Nick is gone.

158
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,169
Dina, look, you and Nicky,

159
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,337
you're like family
to me, okay?

160
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:15,471
And in my family,

161
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:17,890
we take care
of our own. Okay?

162
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:19,875
Okay.

163
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:21,394
I'm sorry for your loss.

164
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:24,897
Nick was like
a brother to me.

165
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:27,683
Hey now, come on.

166
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:32,188
We'll talk to you
soon. Okay.

167
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:38,494
I'm gonna find
the son of a bitch who did this.

168
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,530
And on my life,
I'm gonna make him pay.

169
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:48,754
You know, that girl's
always forgetting something.

170
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:51,540
Frank.

171
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:52,541
Oh.

172
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:53,909
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

173
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,378
No, no, no, come on in.
It's all right.

174
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,963
Come on in. Um...

175
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:00,349
Look, I know, uh,
I know we've been working

176
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:01,378
on that construction deal,

177
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:03,582
and I'm sorry for
my dropping the ball.

178
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,254
We've had a death
in the family.

179
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,555
I'm terribly sorry
to hear that.

180
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:07,756
Thank you.

181
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,442
Actually, though,
I'm not here

182
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:11,427
to discuss business.

183
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,098
Oh. Okay.

184
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,566
Heh.

185
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:19,368
Well, this is, uh...

186
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,655
this is one merger
I won't stand in the way of.

187
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:25,274
Excuse me, sweetie.

188
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:27,293
A father knows
when he's not needed.

189
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:33,132
Was I not clear

190
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:37,403
that I wasn't interested
in talking?

191
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:39,755
You don't have to talk.

192
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:55,137
Who was she?

193
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,841
Somebody I knew a long time ago.

194
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:03,446
I--I was dating
her sister,

195
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:05,081
and it was getting serious.

196
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,501
But back then,
I did not do serious well.

197
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:11,454
But I was excellent
at screwing things up.

198
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:18,577
I started sleeping
with Sara.

199
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,798
I started sleeping with
my girlfriend's sister.

200
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:29,055
I brought her on the yacht
and she died.

201
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,609
Right in front of me.

202
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:36,212
And I hurt--
I hurt her family...

203
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:41,834
I just didn't care.

204
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,173
Before the island,
I wasn't a good person.

205
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:47,898
I was...

206
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,825
Selfish and thoughtless

207
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:56,916
and awful, and it affected--
really affected people.

208
00:10:56,918 --> 00:11:00,219
People I loved.

209
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:03,923
'Cause, Helena...

210
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:06,258
You're on an island, too.

211
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,895
Oliver, I...

212
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:12,214
I want to let you in.

213
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:18,237
But...Michael was
the last man I opened up to.

214
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:21,890
I can't be hurt again.

215
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:24,026
I'd never hurt you.

216
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:29,198
I would never hurt you.

217
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,417
I promise.

218
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,128
Uh-uh. Relax.

219
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,495
Relax, relax, relax.

220
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:44,901
Now, pull back gently.

221
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,557
You need all 3 fingers

222
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,039
to come off the bowstring
at the same time.

223
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,325
Relax. Breathe.

224
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,179
And release.

225
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,166
This is a waste of time.

226
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,801
I'm trying
to teach you something.

227
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:03,753
What, the least effective way
to shoot people?

228
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,505
No. Control.

229
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,957
To use a bow and arrow

230
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:13,563
requires patience
and discipline.

231
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,410
I can do this all day.

232
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:45,762
It's kind of fun.

233
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,180
I love a man with stamina.

234
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:51,017
Our crusades have
something in common.

235
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,053
Mine started
with my father, too.

236
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:57,089
He left me with a list.

237
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:59,058
People who need to be reminded

238
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,427
that Starling City isn't
theirs for the taking.

239
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,813
Anthony Venza is in here.

240
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,448
He works for my dad.

241
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,451
He deals illegal
prescription pills.

242
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,437
Diggle, this is Helena.

243
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:14,657
Diggle's my, uh...

244
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,042
Associate.

245
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:18,461
Well, any associate
of Oliver's is--

246
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,097
Absolutely nothing
to you, ma'am.

247
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,803
I'll leave you two
"associates"...

248
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,160
She knows my name.

249
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:35,678
That's lovely.

250
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,313
You can trust her.

251
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,066
Except I don't.

252
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:42,068
You sleeping
with this girl, Oliver?

253
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,653
Well, I don't think that's
any of your business, Diggle.

254
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,689
It became my business when
you brought me into this.

255
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,880
And when I signed on,
I told you I was gonna

256
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:49,827
keep your head straight.

257
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,812
Well, Oliver, you're lonely.
Lonelier than you want to admit.

258
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:54,480
And that's why you think
you can change this girl,

259
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,149
because you
need to think you can.

260
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,617
You're like a dope fiend
who thinks

261
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,085
he can deal with
his own addiction

262
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,120
by making another addict
go straight.

263
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:03,106
Oliver, what you do
is dangerous.

264
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,175
And getting confused about
who's good and who's bad

265
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,043
is a good way
to get yourself dead.

266
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:10,296
You done?

267
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:14,350
Yeah, I'm done.

268
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:15,969
With this.

269
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,605
Everything else, I don't know.

270
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,307
I don't know, Oliver.
You tell me.

271
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,519
I hope you don't have
plans tomorrow night,

272
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,187
because I just got us a rez
at that new restaurant,

273
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:36,706
Table Salt, opening night.

274
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,992
Isn't that place
ridiculously expensive?

275
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:41,077
Everywhere worth going is.

276
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,863
Ah, you have the cutest crinkle
in your forehead when you're worried.

277
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:45,665
Tommy, stop.
This is serious.

278
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,917
I thought you were going
to live more frugally.

279
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,503
Yeah, I know. Everybody
is grown up except for me.

280
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:54,140
Even Oliver has a job.
He's working on that new night club.

281
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:56,726
You have thinky face.
Why do you have thinky face?

282
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,761
Have you ever thought about
asking Oliver for a job?

283
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,346
Not even once.

284
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,315
This isn't a quality
that I love most about you,

285
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,984
but you do know the club scene
and how to have fun.

286
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:06,903
You make some
very valid points.

287
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,888
Look, I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to Ollie later

288
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,740
and we'll see
what he thinks.

289
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,693
He is gonna think
it is a great idea.

290
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:17,196
How was your trip
to Australia?

291
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,198
I've always wanted to go.

292
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,733
Down under. It's just--

293
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,585
I have this thing
about kangaroos.

294
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,203
More of a phobia.
They wig me out.

295
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,172
They look evil, and I'm
sure their picture's up

296
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:27,840
on like everything
everywhere in that country.

297
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,143
You had something
important to tell me, Ms. Smoak?

298
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,911
Yes, I did.

299
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:36,182
It's about Tempest.
Your wife's mysterious LLC,

300
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,551
the one she diverted
company funds to.

301
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:40,770
I appreciate your
diligence on this, but, uh,

302
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:43,056
it was a simple misunderstanding
between my wife and I.

303
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:44,274
Everything's been resolved.

304
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,758
No. See, it hasn't.

305
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,927
There was something
about the money transfer

306
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:50,313
that felt hinky to me.
The money your wife

307
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:53,399
withdrew from the company,
I wasn't the only one who tracked it.

308
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:54,717
She was being shadowed
by another entity,

309
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,402
and whoever it is,
they're good.

310
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:57,737
NSA good.

311
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,122
But, as you know,

312
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:01,374
I'm good, too.

313
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,709
So even though they
left almost no trace

314
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:05,411
of their presence
in our system,

315
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,546
I did manage
to find one thing.

316
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:10,099
Well, one image.

317
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:13,119
Does that symbol mean
something to you, sir?

318
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:17,106
No.

319
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:18,474
What means something to me

320
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:20,443
is one of my employees

321
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,478
prying into my wife's
private business

322
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,929
without authorization.

323
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:26,065
And should it happen again,

324
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,150
I'll have you suspended.

325
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:29,485
Is that clear?

326
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,455
Crystal.

327
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:52,224
Where's your friend?

328
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:54,977
Just the two of us
tonight.

329
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,729
Oh, really?

330
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,797
And what did you
have in mind?

331
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,399
An object lesson.

332
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,768
We're going after
Anthony Venza?

333
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,438
Yes. But we're doing it
on my terms.

334
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,406
Your father loses a piece
of his organization,

335
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:11,193
but no innocent people
get hurt in the process.

336
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,578
What is it?

337
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,979
I explained to you
that guns

338
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:15,814
were weapons of emotion
and unpredictability,

339
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,783
but since you are far
from an expert at archery,

340
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:21,454
this will have to do,
for now.

341
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,125
I like it.

342
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,160
You can't go out
like that.

343
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:31,213
Why? You got a spare hood?

344
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,220
Does it come in purple?

345
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:44,360
I like purple.

346
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,395
This isn't crack.

347
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:47,813
Anyone can sell crack.

348
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,616
All you need's a street
corner and a hoodie.

349
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:54,203
This is pharmaceutical
grade Oxycodone.

350
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:57,490
It is caviar.
It is champagne.

351
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:00,876
And you sell this
with fancy houses,

352
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:04,547
at parties with rich kids
have got money to burn.

353
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,700
Check it out!

354
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,601
Whoever you are,

355
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,521
you really think you're gonna
get out of here in one piece?

356
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:31,390
I was thinking
the same thing.

357
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:34,059
Anthony Venza...

358
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:40,282
You have failed this city.

359
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,543
Aah!

360
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:55,464
Uhh! The door!

361
00:18:56,767 --> 00:19:00,919
Please...just don't hurt me.

362
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:02,555
Aww...

363
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:06,925
How about just a little?

364
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,284
Millions of dollars' worth
of illegal drugs confiscated,

365
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:18,120
a massive blow to your
father's criminal proceeds,

366
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,938
and nobody had to die.

367
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,292
Justice.

368
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:25,578
What do you think?

369
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,083
I think this feels good.

370
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:35,754
And not just
the justice part.

371
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:50,026
Anthony Venza
was arrested last night.

372
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:51,292
The police confiscated
a warehouse

373
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,160
full of illegal
prescription drugs

374
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:55,195
with a street value
estimated in the millions.

375
00:19:55,197 --> 00:19:57,531
Several unconfirmed
witnesses reported seeing

376
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,835
the Starling City vigilante
leaving the scene

377
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:02,136
with another
unknown accomplice...

378
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,671
possibly a woman.

379
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:08,876
Bad year?

380
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,378
The scotch, I mean.

381
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,348
Yeah. Sorry.

382
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,718
Another business setback.

383
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,504
Wow.

384
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:22,506
You look beautiful.

385
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:25,376
Oliver Queen?

386
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:31,248
Oh...It's nice
to see you happy again.

387
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,234
It's been too long.

388
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,925
Yeah.

389
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:45,546
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about Venza.

390
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:48,582
Yeah, I know where
that leaves us!

391
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:55,523
I'm sorry to rush out.

392
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,192
I have this impromptu
Board of Directors meeting

393
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:00,928
with the Starling City
Modern Art museum.

394
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,114
I don't know much about art,

395
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:04,598
but I do know
how to pay for it.

396
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,951
No worries.
Whip them into shape.

397
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:11,122
Yes, sir. I'll see you
when I get back.

398
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:48,302
Well, it's only been 30 minutes.

399
00:22:48,304 --> 00:22:50,421
That's not too bad
for an opening.

400
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:52,611
If they don't seat us soon,

401
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:54,593
I'm going to write
a horrible review online.

402
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:57,511
Let me see what I can do.

403
00:22:57,513 --> 00:23:00,731
Hey. I'm loving the Cavalli.

404
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:02,382
Uh, look, I'm Tommy Merlyn.

405
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:05,069
Is there any way that we can go
to the head of the class?

406
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:07,488
Is there?

407
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,108
Let us know
when our table's ready, okay?

408
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,527
Maybe you can eat

409
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,197
some of those fancy peanuts
from behind the bar.

410
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,065
Hey!

411
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,086
Hi. It's the two of you.

412
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:24,905
Tommy, Laurel,
this is Helena.

413
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:27,258
Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

414
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,093
Likewise.

415
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:30,244
You look beautiful.

416
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:31,745
Thank you.

417
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:33,747
Mr. Queen,
your table is ready.

418
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,249
When is our table
gonna be ready?

419
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:36,350
When it is.

420
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:37,851
Why don't you both
join us?

421
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:39,253
No, no, we're just
gonna have a drink and--

422
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:41,105
We'd love to.
Are you sure?

423
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:43,924
I'm sure I'm hungry.

424
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:45,976
That--

425
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:48,112
That'll be great.
That sounds great.

426
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:50,147
There you go.

427
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:55,619
I had forgotten that you filled
your parents' pool with beer.

428
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:57,738
How many cases did that take?

429
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,790
Roughly a thousand or so.

430
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:02,376
You know, his father
was so pissed,

431
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:04,128
I thought he was actually
going to drown you in it.

432
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,546
Yeah, well, death by beer,

433
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:07,281
there's worse ways to go.
Right, Helena?

434
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:09,466
Well, there are
no good ways to die.

435
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:13,053
So, uh, how did you
and Tommy meet?

436
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,623
Actually, we've all known
each other since--

437
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,409
We've all known each other
forever.

438
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:20,961
You 3 have
a lot of history.

439
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:22,513
Sometimes a little too much.

440
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:23,931
Hmm.

441
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:26,233
So, how's the night club
coming along?

442
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,986
Slower than I expected
it to. I've, uh, I've been busy.

443
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:31,138
Well, then you must be happy
to have the extra help, then.

444
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,324
Laurel, I'm sure
that Oliver what do you mean?

445
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:35,025
Doesn't want to talk
about work right know.

446
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,093
You didn't ask him?

447
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,611
Ask me what?

448
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:40,914
Tommy wanted--Tommy said
that he was gonna talk to you

449
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,517
about working for you
at your night club.

450
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:47,454
Really?

451
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:48,872
Sorry. I didn't think
that you wanted

452
00:24:48,874 --> 00:24:50,324
any responsibility at all.

453
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:52,226
Oh, yeah,
who'd believe that?

454
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:53,811
You've always wanted
to get into business with Tommy.

455
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:56,013
I mean, don't you remember
when we went to Aspen

456
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:57,798
and you wanted
to open a ski lodge?

457
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,499
The only thing
that I remember from Aspen

458
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:02,803
was your father being furious
we shared a room with one bed.

459
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:06,767
Wait, um...

460
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:09,302
So you two
were together...

461
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:11,772
And now you're dating
his best friend?

462
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:15,142
Yeah, we're just prime for
a reality show, aren't we?

463
00:25:17,962 --> 00:25:22,666
Tommy, you working for me,
that could be fun.

464
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:25,502
I don't feel so good.
I'm gonna step outside.

465
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:29,089
I should probably
go check on him.

466
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:31,708
Helena, it was very nice
to meet you.

467
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:40,434
Tommy, why are you so upset?

468
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:42,686
Why did you have to say
something to Oliver about the job?

469
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:44,054
You were supposed
to talk to him.

470
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:45,639
Well, I hadn't.

471
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,274
Okay, I didn't realize.
I was only trying to help.

472
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:49,309
No, you were trying
to get Oliver to help.

473
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:52,212
It's typical Laurel.
Always running to a white knight.

474
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:54,798
It's Oliver and Laurel.

475
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,850
It always has been.

476
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:59,153
That's not gonna change.

477
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:01,121
Oliver and I are over.

478
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:03,824
Oh, really? Because you seemed
awfully bothered by his new girlfriend.

479
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:05,492
What, am I supposed
to like her?

480
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,661
I do not want to be
Oliver's charity case, okay?

481
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:09,997
To every day be reminded

482
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:13,884
that I can't give you
everything he could?

483
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:15,535
You know, losing a fortune

484
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,504
I think is going to be
easier than losing you,

485
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:19,539
so why don't we
just stop now.

486
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:27,481
Hey. I'm sorry.

487
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:30,067
How am I supposed to know
it's gonna get so weird in there?

488
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:34,354
No, I'm sorry.
Sorry I ever listened to you.

489
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:35,555
Helena, what--

490
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:37,324
you know what
I've been through.

491
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:39,893
I told you I couldn't
be hurt again.

492
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,995
I'm not trying
to hurt you.

493
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:44,915
So, making me have dinner
with the love of your life

494
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:46,667
is what, Oliver?

495
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:49,402
Laurel was the girl things
were getting too serious with,

496
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:53,240
the girl whose sister's grave
you used to manipulate me.

497
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:54,541
I saw the way
you looked at her.

498
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:56,593
That kind of love
doesn't die.

499
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,879
You still love her.

500
00:26:58,881 --> 00:26:59,930
I don't.

501
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:04,384
Don't.
Hey.

502
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:05,418
Don't touch me.

503
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,472
I am done talking.

504
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:30,624
I came to apologize.

505
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:34,762
I know you were
just trying to help.

506
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:38,015
I guess I wasn't ready
to face reality.

507
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:40,584
This is just so new,
you and me,

508
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:43,303
and I didn't
want you to see...

509
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:45,920
I'm scared.

510
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:50,291
I'm almost 30 years old
and I've never been given

511
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,010
an ounce of responsibility
in my life.

512
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:56,380
You, you are driven
and intelligent.

513
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:58,699
You're a million times
too good for me,

514
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:00,751
even before I was broke.

515
00:28:00,753 --> 00:28:04,255
And now I have absolutely
nothing to bring to whatever this is.

516
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,724
I never cared
about the money.

517
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,327
And truth be told,
billionaire

518
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,296
was your least
attractive quality.

519
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:17,118
I am so sorry if I pushed you
too hard on the job with Oliver.

520
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,670
I just--I thought you working
for him was a good idea

521
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:22,106
because
he's your friend.

522
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:24,759
And it's okay to ask
a friend for help.

523
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:27,294
You won't lose
your street cred.

524
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:29,897
I'm happy to lose
my street cred.

525
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:33,234
I just don't want
to lose you.

526
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:36,604
Well...

527
00:28:36,606 --> 00:28:41,508
I'm not saying that
it's gonna be easy...

528
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,154
But I'm here for you

529
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,665
if you need someone
to lean on.

530
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:48,799
That's what people do
when they're together.

531
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:52,853
Together like
boyfriend-girlfriend?

532
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:56,857
Mm. Do not ruin
this moment.

533
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,377
It was going so well
for you.

534
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:13,507
Didn't expect to hear
from you tonight.

535
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:16,427
Something happen?

536
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,430
I think you were right.

537
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:23,684
Okay. About which part?

538
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:25,186
All of it.

539
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,008
I should have listened to you.

540
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:36,163
Oliver, you said you wanted
to help her change.

541
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:40,418
The thing is,
she already did change.

542
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,670
When her father
killed her fiance,

543
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:45,306
she changed into something
dark and twisted.

544
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:47,241
You see that now, don't you?

545
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,576
It's not that I--it's not
that I couldn't see it, Diggle.

546
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:52,763
I didn't--I didn't want to.

547
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:55,766
I'm living a double life,
and to do that,

548
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:57,685
I'm taking all these people
that I love

549
00:29:57,687 --> 00:29:59,253
and I'm putting them
at arm's length.

550
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,588
I'm giving up a lot,
so maybe--

551
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,275
maybe I thought
the universe owed me one.

552
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:08,095
But I looked in
her eyes tonight,

553
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,449
and I can't stop her
from going over the edge.

554
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:14,401
She's--she's already past it.

555
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:39,927
Aah!

556
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:43,013
Aah! Aah!

557
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:51,906
I don't speak Chinese,

558
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:55,826
so I'm just gonna assume
you said good-bye.

559
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:09,507
Tell your mistress
Frank Bertinelli sends his regards.

560
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:22,937
Ahem.

561
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:24,522
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Steele?

562
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:27,174
Did I mention,
it's almost Christmas,

563
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,526
and many of the suicides
this time of year

564
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:31,412
are due to sudden
and unexpected joblessness?

565
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:37,701
I want you to find out
all you can about that notebook.

566
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:39,418
Where it was made,
how it was purchased.

567
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,132
And what it could mean.
Yes, sir.

568
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,116
Felicity...

569
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:45,419
I asked Josiah Hudson,
our head of security,

570
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,755
to look into
the same subject matter.

571
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:53,260
He died the next day
under questionable circumstances.

572
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,213
What I may be asking of you,

573
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,998
this mystery,

574
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,434
are you sure
you want to do this?

575
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,336
I hate mysteries.

576
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,488
They bug me.

577
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,940
They need to be solved.

578
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,952
It's Dig.

579
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,021
What's the situation?

580
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,923
War.

581
00:32:44,454 --> 00:32:47,051
Boss, we just got word--
somebody hit Zhishan.

582
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:48,441
He's dead.

583
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,095
All right. Then we know
what's coming next.

584
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,998
Tell everyone
to strap up.

585
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,175
Uhh!

586
00:33:13,183 --> 00:33:16,518
Ricco's not answering
his walkie. Check it out.

587
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:00,863
Frank Bertinelli--

588
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,364
this is for Zhishan.

589
00:34:04,284 --> 00:34:05,901
Uhh!

590
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:09,288
Run.

591
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,310
Aah!

592
00:34:31,312 --> 00:34:33,395
Ohh! Oh!

593
00:34:38,024 --> 00:34:40,809
Oh--Helena.

594
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:41,810
What is this?

595
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:44,980
Payback for Michael.

596
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,816
I know you had him killed.
Salvati told me.

597
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:49,768
I did that to protect
the family!

598
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,820
I had to take everything
away from you

599
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:55,207
because you took
everything away from me.

600
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,995
You finally know
what it feels like

601
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,863
to find out, your own blood
is responsible

602
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:05,584
for the death
of your entire world.

603
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:41,587
No!

604
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:49,712
Helena?

605
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:52,798
Helena.

606
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:25,241
Helena, easy. Easy.

607
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:28,044
You were lucky.

608
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:30,630
Am I supposed
to be grateful?

609
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:31,914
Helena--

610
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:33,099
He's a monster.

611
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:36,019
A criminal.
Why would you save him?

612
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:39,422
I didn't save him.
I saved you.

613
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:41,441
You think that because
you've killed,

614
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:44,060
you understand what it's like
to have blood on your hands.

615
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:45,678
You don't understand.
You don't understand

616
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,031
the toll
that it takes on you,

617
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,783
especially
when it's your father.

618
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:52,051
I'm not going to stop.

619
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:54,070
The police
have him in custody.

620
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:56,439
He's going to jail
and then on to prison.

621
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:57,991
They don't have
any evidence on him.

622
00:36:57,993 --> 00:36:59,492
They do now.

623
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:02,445
The laptop.

624
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:03,897
He's going away, Helena,

625
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,082
for the rest of his life.

626
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:08,951
This...is justice.

627
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:10,720
Then I guess you were right.

628
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:12,672
I'm more interested
in revenge.

629
00:37:12,674 --> 00:37:14,924
Stay out of my way, Oliver,

630
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:18,678
or I'll make sure your secret
doesn't stay secret.

631
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,097
Helena.

632
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:26,936
What I did,

633
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:29,072
everything that I've done,

634
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:32,492
I've done because
I care about you.

635
00:37:32,494 --> 00:37:38,114
Too bad I can't say
the same.

636
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:51,544
Hey, you.

637
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:52,845
Thanks for the call.

638
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:55,515
What are
ex-sisters-in-law for?

639
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:57,800
Mm.

640
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:05,725
Chili cheese fries
with jalapenos. Hmm.

641
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,863
That's a cry for help
if I've ever seen one.

642
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:12,148
Ahh...

643
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,950
I don't know what hurts worse,

644
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:18,037
this or getting shot
with a curare-laced bullet.

645
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,707
Been there, done that.
Definitely the bullet.

646
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,525
Ah...

647
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,098
You know, Oliver, I'm
no expert at this, but...

648
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,536
I don't think love is about
changing or saving a person.

649
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:35,555
I think it's about
finding the person

650
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:37,340
who's already the right fit.

651
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,345
One day you will.

652
00:38:42,347 --> 00:38:46,549
I think I burnt
that particular bridge.

653
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,651
Napalmed it, actually.

654
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,886
So things didn't work out
exactly as you planned.

655
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:52,355
You did save
Frank Bertinelli's life.

656
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:54,107
He'll be doing time
for a while.

657
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:56,159
Justice wins out.

658
00:38:56,161 --> 00:39:00,563
Helena
doesn't see it that way.

659
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:04,233
You opened up,
took a risk with your heart.

660
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:06,736
The Oliver I met
a few months ago

661
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:10,072
would not have been
able to do that.

662
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:12,608
And when you meet
the right person,

663
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,744
you'll be ready for her.

664
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:31,194
What are you doing?

665
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:33,279
It needs to be dark in here
for me to do this.

666
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:35,565
If I had had more time
to think of that sentence

667
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,617
it wouldn't have sounded
so dirty.

668
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,101
Look.

669
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:46,292
I don't see anything.

670
00:39:46,294 --> 00:39:47,877
I got these
from applied sciences.

671
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,629
They're able to pick up
the subvisible variations

672
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:51,664
in the UV spectrum.

673
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,751
Now look at the book again.

674
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,993
Hi.

675
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:22,912
Now, look,

676
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:24,664
I'm sorry about last night.

677
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,816
It just--I let it
get too far

678
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:29,168
sitting at the same table.
That was...

679
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,453
that was stupid.

680
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:34,257
No. I was stupid.

681
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:38,494
I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

682
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,131
My dad cut me off.

683
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:43,966
He froze all my funds.

684
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:47,303
I am living on fumes.

685
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:48,805
Really?

686
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,507
Why didn't you
say anything?

687
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,276
Embarrassment,
shame, jealousy,

688
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:56,779
probably a few other emotions
I'm not used to feeling.

689
00:40:56,781 --> 00:40:59,198
Tommy, my trust fund
is your trust fund.

690
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:01,901
No.

691
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:04,153
That is the easy answer.

692
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:08,374
And believe me,
I have loved easy answers.

693
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:10,376
What I need is a job.

694
00:41:12,529 --> 00:41:14,213
I'm trying to change.

695
00:41:14,215 --> 00:41:18,200
Not sure into what yet,
but...

696
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:21,254
I don't want to be
what I was anymore.

697
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,340
It just so happens
that I have

698
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:26,041
a general manager
position

699
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:28,377
that is available.

700
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:31,514
You're probably
the guy for the job.

701
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:33,516
Will I be getting dental?
This smile wasn't cheap.

702
00:41:33,518 --> 00:41:36,602
I'll look into that.
Thank you.

703
00:41:36,604 --> 00:41:38,070
Thank you.

704
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:40,022
You're welcome.

705
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:46,078
You okay?

706
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,414
I will be.

707
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,116
