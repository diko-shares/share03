PRESENTER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

3
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:18,277
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

4
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,645
<i>Y</i>es!

5
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:27,395
Come on!

6
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,761
It's the last night of the tour!

7
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:32,562
<i>Y</i>es!

8
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,445
Right, let's start with a joke.
Why did the chicken cross the road?

9
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:40,758
'Cause his house is being bombed by the
Russians. Leave him alone, he's only a chicken!

10
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:42,360
<i>Y</i>eah, you don't like the politics, do you?

11
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:43,721
Do you know what it's like to walk down the street

12
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:46,560
with everything you own in a plastic bag
whilst your house is being bombed?

13
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,639
No, you don't. Leave that chicken alone.

14
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:52,685
Is this on? Leave him alone, he's a chicken.

15
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,997
Sorry, not chicken. Chechen.

16
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:01,116
I messed that right up, didn't I?

17
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:04,438
<i>Y</i>ou gotta get the beginning bit right.
That's why I came on to Franz Ferdinand.

18
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:05,846
'Cause I wanted a big impact when I came on.

19
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,077
-They're great Franz Ferdinand, aren't they?
-AUDIENCE: <i>Y</i>eah.

20
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,044
Named after the Archduke Franz Ferdinand

21
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,436
who was assassinated in 1 91 4,
which led to the First World War

22
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:15,439
and the death of 1 5 million people,
which in itself led to the Second World War

23
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:18,644
and the rise of Hitler and fascism
and the death of a further 55 million people,

24
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,479
including six million innocent Jews.

25
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,795
<i>Y</i>eah, let's hear you.

26
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:23,764
# I say don't you know

27
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:25,883
# <i>Y</i>ou say you don't know

# I say

00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,721
# Take me out #

30
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,638
Tough crowd.

31
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:33,683
I could come on like Robbie Williams
as well, right?

32
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:38,841
I wish someone would tell Robbie Williams
that this doesn't constitute entertainment.

33
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:42,998
Look at me, smug as f***.

34
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:48,125
Come on, Glastonbury, you know this one.

35
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,602
<i>Y</i>eah, we know it, Robbie.
It was 1 50 quid to get in.

36
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:54,201
Any chance you could sing it for us?

37
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,406
Imagine if I came on like that.

38
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,206
I'll tell you something, a funny thing happened
to me on the way here tonight.

39
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:07,323
I think you know this one.

40
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:11,158
Lee Mack, smug as f***.

41
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,004
I could also start like the gymnast starts,

42
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:19,557
try and get your attention by doing this,
couldn't I?

43
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:24,038
I love the way they do that.
As if something amazing is about to happen.

44
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:27,723
In case there's any doubt,
they throw one of these in.

45
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:32,755
That's just to let the world know
that this could be amazing.

46
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:36,122
<i>B</i>e great if they messed that up now and again.

47
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:39,165
''Here's the favourite from <i>B</i>ulgaria.
If she gets a perfect 1 0, she wins the gold.

48
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,442
''Let's see if she can do it.''

49
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:45,281
''S***!

50
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:50,000
''Three years concentrating on me triple-axle,
I forgot about the tippy-toes.''

51
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,317
I love gymnastics. It's the one event,
when it's on every four years,

52
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,045
that the whole of the <i>B</i>ritish public just watches it

53
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,004
and doesn't understand
anything that's happening.

54
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,645
Every four years, everyone just goes...

55
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:00,366
(IMITATING SOUND OF G<i>Y</i>MNAST'S ROUTINE)

56
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,799
Was that any good?

57
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,679
It dawned on me recently

58
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,520
there's only two things
you need to know about any gymnastics event.

59
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,006
That's good.

60
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,519
That's s***. That's all you got to know, isn't it?

61
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,246
Forget all that tumbling-around business. <i>B</i>rilliant.

62
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:19,840
Get off, you're rubbish.

63
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:23,317
I like the people that mess it up
and then try and incorporate it.

64
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:27,765
''I meant to do that. That bit.

65
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,156
''<i>Y</i>eah. Hell, yeah.

66
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,477
''I've been practising that for four years,
that little thing...

67
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:35,365
''2.4, you Polish t***! I meant to do that.''

68
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,957
I could also come on
like the New Zealand rugby team.

69
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:42,756
I love the fact they do this
to try and scare the opposition.

70
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,317
''Oh, that's terrifying, don't.
We're s******* ourselves.''

71
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,922
I always think, give them a little hat,
a little cane, go on.

72
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:52,477
# Pardon me, sir
Is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo? #

73
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:55,480
I went to college with loads of rugby people

74
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,922
and I'm telling you,
at my college they wouldn't have found that scary.

75
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:01,283
The only thing they found scary at my college
was gay people.

76
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,164
They're very homophobic, the rugby community.

77
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,478
I think it would be far better suited
if New Zealand just came out and went,

78
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,320
''One, two, three, four. Kick, two, three, four.

79
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:11,875
''One, two, three. Kick, two, three, four.

80
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,720
''Hands, hands and walk, two, three, four.

81
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,237
''Two, three, four... Nice shoes.''

82
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:20,637
# I am what I am
I am my own... #

83
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,160
''Catch, Tony.''

84
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:27,637
All the English players are going,
''F*** this! We're going home! Come on!

85
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,002
''That's it! Drag your knuckles.''

86
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,157
Hello, sir, in the front row there, you all right?

87
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,521
-I'm all right.
-Nice glasses.

88
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,201
-Thank you.
-<i>Y</i>eah, you're welcome. What's your name?

89
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:40,436
-Nev.
-Nev?

00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,245
-<i>Y</i>eah.
-<i>Y</i>ou remind me of my driving instructor.

91
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:45,285
Lend me those glasses for a second.
What do you do, Nev?

92
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,039
-I'm a lawyer.
-<i>Y</i>ou're a lawyer?

93
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,561
-Oh, hello. How old are you?
-Twenty-nine.

94
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,603
Twenty-nine? What kind of law is it?

95
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:53,962
F****** hell! <i>Y</i>ou sure you're not a welder?

(IMITATING WELDING TORCH)

97
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,205
I just turn into Eric Morecambe
when I've got these sort of glasses on, sorry.

98
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,925
''Hey, how long...

99
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,720
''have you...''

MAN: <i>Y</i>ou've no idea how funny that is.

101
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:27,047
That's the weirdest heckle
anyone's ever given me.

102
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:31,166
A bloke at the front just went,
''<i>Y</i>ou've no idea how funny that is.''

103
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,562
I think you'll find I know exactly how funny it is.

104
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:39,435
That's why I'm stood up here in the West End,
you daft t***.

105
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,087
I'm not up here going, ''Why are you all laughing?
These are true stories! Stop laughing! Stop it!

106
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,921
''<i>Y</i>ou're laughing at me! These are facts! My life!''

107
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,359
I'll tell you how funny they are.

108
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,642
In a minute when I say,
''Knock, knock,'' just say, ''Who's there?''

109
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:57,037
Don't go, ''That'll be someone at the door.
Oh, it's real! It's real!

110
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:59,595
''<i>Y</i>ou don't know how funny this is!''

111
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,563
Do you do that when you're watching drama?
Stand up and go,

112
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:07,117
''<i>Y</i>ou don't know how sad this is!
<i>Y</i>ou're making me cry!''

113
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:12,559
''<i>Y</i>ou are...''

114
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:14,883
My driving instructor wore glasses like this.

115
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:18,164
<i>Y</i>ou're not a driving instructor, you're a lawyer.
We've just been through that.

116
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,522
He was driving down the road and he said,
''What I'm gonna do,

117
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:23,360
''I'm gonna slap my hand on the dashboard
and I want you to make an emergency stop

<i>B</i>efore he could put his belt on,
I whizzed me brakes on like that,

120

on the window like this.

(SPEAKING IN SLOW MOTION)
<i>Y</i>ou've no idea how funny that is.

This bit particularly.

123
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:21,358
He didn't do all this bit, I'm just showing off now.

124
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:24,166
He said, ''Why didn't you wait
till I slapped me hand on the dashboard?''

125
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:29,367
I said, ''There is a child's life at stake here.
I haven't got time to f*** about with games.''

126
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:36,356
Sorry, Nev, you didn't see any of that, did you?
Sorry, mate.

127
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:41,243
He was sat there going,
''What's he doing? What's that noise?

128
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,283
''Has he got a kind face?

00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,204
''Is <i>B</i>etty still sat?''

130
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:53,158
I'd like to see you doing your court of law thing.

00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:56,205
''<i>Y</i>es, and I'll tell you why he's innocent.''
''Cashier number 5, please.''

00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:58,005
''Sorry. Sorry.''

133
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:08,716
I'll tell you a bit about myself.
I'm in a relationship at the moment. Sorry, girls.

It's gonna have to be your place.

135
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,366
She's a lovely girl, my wife. She's...

136
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:23,117
She works in a laboratory
testing cosmetics on animals.

137
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,526
Nice girl.

138
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:28,638
She hates my job
'cause I'm always trying me jokes out on her.

139
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:32,083
Fair enough.
She's always rubbing shampoo in me eyes.

140
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,641
She hates it when I do this job,

141
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:39,366
it gets very obsessive, this job.
I'm always thinking about comedy.

142
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,244
I went home the other day
for a break from the tour,

143
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:45,525
it was about a three-week break, actually.
It's not going great.

144
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,485
I realised how obsessed I was becoming

145
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,603
'cause I was in Habitat
and she was looking at this cupboard

146
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,598
going, ''Can we afford that cupboard?

147
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:54,996
''Will it fit in the house? Is it the right shape?''

148
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:58,159
I realised after 1 5 minutes,
I hadn't listened to a word she'd said.

149
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,717
I'd spent the whole 1 5 minutes just thinking,

150
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,004
''Wouldn't it be funny if I got in that cupboard?''

151
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:09,362
It'd be great, wouldn't it,
when people are looking round.

152
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,005
''Hello.

153
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,603
''I think Narnia's closed.''

154
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:22,482
It's going very well at the moment, though.
She's carrying our first child.

155
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:25,035
He's eight, the lazy little f*****.

156
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:30,805
It's going very well. In fact, we've had the baby.
I just don't want to drop the joke.

157
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,037
I'd rather drop the baby.

158
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:34,879
<i>B</i>ut, no, it's going very well.
I'm glad we had the baby.

159
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,844
We had lots of rows about the whole baby thing.

160
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:41,637
I wanted to have the baby for about five years,
but she wants to keep it for ever, you know.

161
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:45,886
This is a true story.

162
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:49,198
I got told by the doctor that I was infertile
and I couldn't have children. <i>Y</i>eah.

163
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:52,484
Three weeks after he told me that,
my girlfriend was pregnant.

164
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,159
Who's the daddy?

165
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:02,318
Anyway, forget that bit. Um...

166
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,957
Why have you turned up with cut-out...
There's somebody there with cut-outs of animals.

167
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:09,277
-Why have you done that?
-It's a giraffe!

168
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,959
I'm not interested in the type of animals.

169
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,436
I'm interested in the lunacy
of bringing a cut-out animal.

170
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:17,486
I'm not sitting here going,
''<i>Y</i>eah, animals is fine, but what are they?''

171
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:22,163
''Is it a rhinoceros? I hope it is.
That would be appropriate for a comedy gig.''

172
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,397
-What's your name with the lion, sir?
-Dan.

173
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,762
Dan and... Daniel and the lion.

174
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,047
-And what's your name with the crocodile?
-Robert.

175
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:34,405
That doesn't work, that one, does it?
And the penguin, what's your name?

176
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,284
-<i>B</i>en.
-<i>B</i>e great if you had a stutter.

177
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,801
<i>B-B-B-B-B-B</i>en.

178
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,407
Some older people getting that joke.
The rest of you looking at me going,

179
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:45,240
''Wouldn't be great, it'd be an affliction,
and that's wrong.''

180
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,124
Wouldn't it be great if he was in wheelchair?

181
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:50,404
''No, it wouldn't.
That wouldn't be funny at all, Lee, no.''

182
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:51,966
How would he get up there?

183
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,083
I know that's what you're thinking,
that's what I'm thinking.

184
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,601
How did you get up there, you liar?
There's nothing wrong with you.

185
00:10:56,687 --> 00:11:00,521
Sitting in your wheelchair...
Oh, you make me sick, people like you.

186
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:04,202
It's great being here. I knew it was
gonna be good. I got recognised today.

187
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,279
In Dixons. I did.
A member of staff came up to me and went,

188
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,722
''Hey, you're that mad bloke off the telly.''
I went, ''That's me.''

189
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:13,402
Then he went, ''No, you're that mad bloke.
Off the telly.''

190
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,756
<i>Y</i>ou've no idea how funny that is.

191
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,364
I knew this was gonna be a good gig

192
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,563
'cause I came in...
I have been on telly, by the way.

193
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:26,320
I've proper been on telly.
I was on <i>Blind Date</i> 1 4 years ago.

194
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:27,806
That was my first TV experience.

195
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,764
I don't know if you remember me,
but I was the one that went on

196
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:31,724
and decided to ask me own questions, right.

197
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,798
I was supposed to go on
and say something rubbish like,

198
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,037
''Contestant number one,
if you could be any type of fruit,

199
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,606
''what type of fruit would you be?''

200
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,325
And I thought, ''That's rubbish.''
So I went on and said,

201
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,240
''Contestant number one,
do you agree, in principle, to federalism

202
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,319
''encompassing a single European currency?''

203
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,558
And this woman said, ''<i>Y</i>es, if I was an apple,

204
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,797
''you could pick me out of the tree
any time you like.

205
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:53,560
''This doesn't make sense now, Cilla.''
I said, ''That's great, love.

206
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,126
''Now, contestant number two,

207
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:59,485
''Cubism is a corruption
of the Impressionist ideology. Discuss.''

208
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:04,316
She said, ''<i>Y</i>es, if I could have any job
in the world, I'd be a forklift truck driver.

209
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:08,878
''Then I'd come straight round to your house
and show you my t***.''

210
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:12,321
Or something like that.
I can't remember exactly what she said.

211
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,477
That was the gist, right?

212
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,603
Now, at this point, obviously,
I'd lost faith with women.

213
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,245
<i>B</i>ut it didn't matter
'cause then I heard number three.

214
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,079
She was perfect. She said, ''<i>Y</i>es,

215
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,237
''Cubism is a corruption
of the Impressionist ideology

216
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:26,036
''but it's also based on early 20th century
German Dadaism and Neorealism.''

217
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:27,606
And I went,

218
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,598
''I'll take number two.''

219
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,479
So this is good, innit? The <i>B</i>loomsbury Theatre.

220
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:38,639
I knew this was gonna be nice when I walked in
'cause I went to the toilets, right?

221
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:41,924
Do you ever check the toilets out first?
Make sure it's gonna be all right?

222
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,963
What they haven't got here, which I like,
is they haven't got

223
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,242
the bloke in the corner with the dish of money.
Hate that.

224
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:49,444
<i>Y</i>ou know, in the toilet?
<i>B</i>eggars, that's the word I'm looking for.

225
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,762
I hate the fact that I always think
I won't give him any money

226
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,519
but they always get me in the end.
That's what annoys me.

227
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,279
I think, ''Don't give him eye contact,
you'll be fine.''

228
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:59,838
I walk out the cubicle and they go, ''Aftershave?''
''I don't think so.''

229
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:02,236
''Towel?''
''Mmm-mmm, no, no, no.''

230
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:06,117
''Soap?''
''I really can manage.''

231
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:10,080
''Chupa chup?''

232
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:16,515
''Chupa chup? Well, why didn't you say?''
''And only a pound.'' ''Eh?''

233
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:20,644
Food in the toilet. What could possibly go wrong?

234
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,959
''Any sausages?''

235
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,647
<i>Y</i>ou haven't got bouncers here
with the walkie-talkies, which I like.

236
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,126
I love the world ''walkie-talkies''.

237
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:30,959
It's fantastic, innit?
I'd love to have been at the meeting

238
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,322
when they came up with that word.
It's me new favourite word.

239
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:36,763
''Well, we got this wireless communication system.
All we need now is a name. Any ideas?''

240
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,725
''I know!''
''Oh, it's Derek. Hello, Derek.''

241
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:44,437
''Well, think about it, right?
<i>Y</i>ou can walk with it and you can talk with it.''

242
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:48,156
''<i>Y</i>es, you can, can't you?''
''<i>Y</i>es, walkie-talkie.''

243
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:52,157
''We'll deal with this.'' ''Outie-shoutie.''
''No, honestly, it's not gonna work.''

244
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:56,240
''Reachy-speechy, satty-chatty.''
''Shut up, and eat your chicken leg.''

245
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:59,876
''There's a good lad.
Or, as you call them, eatie-feeties.''

246
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,002
I'm obsessed with words at the moment.
It's like in Scrabble.

247
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:05,840
I found out recently, do you know what
the most amount of points you can get

248
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:08,919
in your very first go at Scrabble is?
Does anyone know? Hmm? 1 4 3 points.

249
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:12,920
''Pause, let us answer, Lee!'' 1 4 3 points.
Now, do you know what the word is?

250
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,235
It is ''squeezy''.

251
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:17,285
<i>Y</i>ou get more points for ''squeezy''
on your first go than any other word.

252
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,086
I know this 'cause my mate got it, first go.
I was devastated.

253
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,236
<i>B</i>ut I had the last laugh.

254
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,602
In the next three goes
I had the letters that made up the words

255
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:25,917
''easy'', ''peasy'' and ''lemon''.

256
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,039
I know what you're thinking.
''Lee, that's impossible

257
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,482
''to get all those letters in a straight line
at a game of Scrabble.''

258
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:33,639
<i>Y</i>eah? Well, I'll tell you what I told him.

259
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,242
''It's my f****** house. I'll do what I like.''

260
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,675
What do you mean in Cluedo you can't have

261
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,361
<i>B</i>arbara Windsor in the airing cupboard
with a Stanley knife?

262
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:47,325
If you don't like it, get out of the house.

263
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,716
Nice audience.
Ah, you with your hat on there, sir. Hello.

264
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,925
Feel free to take it off
at any point you like, that's fine.

265
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:58,805
We've actually got something special here
for people like you.

266
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,605
It's called a roof.

267
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:05,083
Where you going? Where you going?
What you doing? What you doing?

268
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,442
Where you going? Where you going?
What you doing? What you doing?

269
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:10,087
Eh? There's a poster out there that says
no filming in the auditorium.

270
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:13,204
She's really stretching that rule, isn't she?

271
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,526
She's not filming it, f****** mental.

272
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,324
Lend me your cap for a second, sir.
That's fantastic. What's your name, mate?

273
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,398
-Simon.
-Pick it up.

274
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,286
Simon. What do you do, Simon?

275
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:34,835
-Photographer.
-Photographer? Fantastic.

276
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,758
Who do you photograph?
Are you, like, fashion or are you...

277
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:38,599
-No, people.
-People?

278
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:42,242
What kind of fashion photographers
are you looking at?

279
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:45,000
That's generally people, innit?
Unless you're into really sordid stuff.

280
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:46,440
(GROWLING)

281
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,126
Sorry about doing that with your hat
to prove a point. Sorry about that.

282
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,641
A bit horrible, innit? See, you look good in this.

283
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,446
<i>Y</i>ou've got that sort of...
Look at it. I mean, it's got that sort of...

284
00:15:57,527 --> 00:16:00,280
slightly chequered sort of...
<i>Y</i>ou're London, aren't you?

285
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,403
So it works. It's ironic but it's cool.

286
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:06,162
Me, I'd just look like a f******
chimney sweep, wouldn't I?

287
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:11,724
<i>B</i>e honest, I look like one of those kids

288
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:15,800
that's gonna get a free trip to Disneyland
any day now, don't I?

289
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:19,404
Hello, my name is Lee Mack. Every day's a bonus.

290
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:29,197
Hey, I can still move it with the kids, though.
Touch me, go on, touch me.

291
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:32,836
Touch me! Touch me, you crack w****! Touch me.

292
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:37,882
It says on her T-shirt ''crack w****'',
just so you know that's why I said that.

293
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:42,040
Are you a crack w****?
Why have you got it on your T-shirt, then?

294
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:44,557
What's it say? ''C'' is for crack w****?

295
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:47,207
So it's not really a thing?
It's just to remind you about spelling, is it?

296
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:50,245
Is that how you do your alphabet?
''C'' is for crack w****.

297
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:53,683
I must remember this. It's like a dirty version
of <i>Sesame Street.</i> It's f****** fantastic.

298
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,520
Today has been brought to you
by the letter ''C'' for crack w****.

299
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,121
And ''<i>B</i>'' for big b*******.

300
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:02,483
(IMITATING ERNIE FROM <i>SESAME STREET)</i>
''Hey, <i>B</i>ert, that's rude.''

301
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,035
I'm sorry, I forgot.
I've had that on for a while, haven't I?

302
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,880
Pick it up. It's not my responsibility, mate.

303
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,798
Not my responsibility.

304
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,444
Crack w****. Are you...

305
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,325
Why would you wear a T-shirt
saying ''crack w****''?

306
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:20,760
I mean, you don't look like the type of person
who takes crack.

307
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:27,076
Well, you've got to be very careful
what you say on stage nowadays.

308
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,397
Look what happened to <i>B</i>ernard Manning.
Read about that?

309
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,159
He did all this anti-Muslim material.

310
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:34,319
Someone emailed him,
threatened to put a fatwa on him. Huh?

311
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:39,276
To be fair, I think they were typing ''fat w*****''
and pressed enter a bit early.

312
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:44,006
<i>Y</i>ou gotta be careful, though.
<i>Y</i>ou gotta be very politically correct nowadays.

313
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:48,205
And I mean proper politically correct, right?
Not like Stevie Wonder. Hypocrite.

314
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,596
''Ebony and ivory
live together in perfect harmony.''

315
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:54,680
Oh, that's great, Stevie. What about the Chinese?
Don't they get a look in?

316
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:59,318
At least meet me halfway.
Play <i>Chopsticks</i> halfway through. I mean, come on.

317
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,962
<i>Y</i>ou gotta be very careful what you say,
you really have.

318
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:04,685
I don't like it when people are
over-politically correct.

319
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:05,961
<i>Y</i>ou know like on <i>Big Brother?</i>

320
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:09,084
Is it my imagination or is that getting
camper and camper with every series?

321
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,920
In fact, if you listen carefully,
it's getting so camp that with every series,

322
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,486
you know the Geordie bloke
that does the announcing?

323
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:17,003
He's getting more Geordie every series
just to balance the whole thing up, isn't he?

324
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:19,647
It's like...

Unless you're into auto-asphyxiation erotica. Ew!

335
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,355
They want stringing up, don't they?

336
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:01,840
I've got loads of gay friends
and there's two things they say they hate.

337
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,724
The two biggest stereotypes when you're gay.

338
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,116
One, ''Ooh, they're very good at interior design.''

339
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:10,280
And two, ''Oh, aren't they well-dressed?''
How patronising is that, right?

340
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,562
My mates that are gay,
none of them are good at interior design.

341
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,480
They'll be the first to admit,
the inside of their houses are a downright mess.

342
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,684
And as for well-dressed,
they're some of the scruffiest people I know.

343
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:22,555
So can we stop these ridiculous 1 970s
bigoted stereotypes?

344
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:26,879
And just all say, as one,
gay people are disgusting.

345
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,839
Everything is getting camp, isn't it?
Even the police sirens are getting camp.

346
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,565
<i>Y</i>ou remember the good old days
when they used to go...

347
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,558
''Nee-nee, nee-nee, nee-nee.''

348
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,719
Nowadays, it's ''Mmmmm!

349
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,718
''Listen to her.

00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,640
''Ooh, robbing a bank and look at his nails.''

351

What's your name? Just scratching
your eye, ''I'm not f****** looking at you.''

352
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:55,961
-Richard's my name.
-Richard My Name?

353
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:57,366
Hello, Richard My Name.

354
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,483
-What do you do, Richard?
-Painting and decorating.

00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,046
-Painting and decorating.
-<i>Y</i>eah.

''<i>Y</i>eah, no more than half a day, that.''

358
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,756
Painter and decorator, that's fantastic.
Whereabouts do you do that?

359
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:19,045
-All over really.
-All over? <i>Y</i>ou're not trying to sell to me.

''F*** me.''

377
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:22,444
I haven't always done this job.
I used to be a freelance journalist.

378
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:24,119
<i>Y</i>eah, I was crap.

00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:26,198
Lance is still in prison.

Christ, some of you needed
a bit of a delay on that one, didn't you?

381
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:36,124
That's the kind of joke that some of you
will wake up at 4:00 in the morning and go,

382
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,004
''Oh, yeah.''

383
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:41,844

''No, still don't get it.''

385
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:46,364
Half of you laughed at that.
The other half just went,

''What time's the meat raffle?''

387
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:50,043
That's fine, all right.

388
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:52,758
I've had lots of jobs, me.
I used to be a doctor as well.

389
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:56,078
I got sacked 'cause I used to have my own
little unique way of telling people the news.

390
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,680
I remember one Thursday afternoon,
this bloke came in.

391
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,520
He said, ''Has my wife had the baby?''
I said, ''<i>Y</i>es.'' He said, ''What's the news?''

392
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:04,077
I said, ''Monday's child is fair of face.
Tuesday's child is full of grace.

393
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,759
''Wednesday's child is full of woe.

394
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:08,042
''Thursday's child, club foot.''

395
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:15,281
<i>Y</i>ou've got to have a laugh if you've got a job.
Is it a good laugh being a painter and decorator?

00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,562
-Good bits and bad bits.
-<i>Y</i>eah?

397
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:21,162
Does it have its medium bits?
Is it all very extreme?

398
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,723
Is it all, ''I f****** love skirting boards.

00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,640
''I love 'em, I love 'em.

<i>Y</i>ou gotta have a laugh

403
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:40,639
If I was the last hangman in <i>B</i>ritain,
I reckon it'd still have been a laugh.

404
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,924
If I'd been the last hangman in <i>B</i>ritain,
there'd be nothing set up in the courtyard.

405
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:47,158
Just me. <i>B</i>loke would come in, I'd say,

00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:49,886
''What we got to do to you. Very sad day.

-Are you a painter and decorator, the missus?
-No.

415
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh, his phone's going off.

416
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,682
His phone's going off?
Probably a job, you better get it.

417
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:24,165
Or a complaint.

418
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:29,719
See, you're very attractive.
<i>Y</i>ou're like me, actually. <i>Y</i>ou're a horse face.

419
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:33,322
<i>Y</i>ou know, you're... No, it's not rude. Hang on.

420
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:36,399
No, I don't mean a face like a horse. No.

421
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:39,797
What I mean is,
there's two types of women's faces, right?

422
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:43,436
<i>Y</i>ou've got like the long face,
which is the horse face, right,

423
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:45,757
and then you've got the round face,
which is the plate face.

424
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:48,122
And there's only ever two types of women's faces.

425
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:51,438
If you need me, I'll be over here digging a hole.

426
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:56,046
<i>B</i>asically, what I'm trying to say is...
<i>Y</i>ou're fantastic looking, right,

427
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,197
the one who's not even bothering looking at me.
<i>Y</i>es, you, madam.

428
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:01,120
<i>Y</i>ou're a horse face, right?
<i>Y</i>ou're a plate 'cause it's round,

429
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:04,279
but it's still an attractive face. Attractive horse.

430
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,723
<i>Y</i>ou can't win. Look at your faces.
If you say ''horse'', women think you mean ugly.

431
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:10,196
If you say ''plate'', they think you mean fat, right?

432
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:13,757
I've honestly got a good mind to stop
even trying to entertain people on trains.

433
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,042
It doesn't mean that, right? It's not rude.

434
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:19,278
Name a famous actress
that's supposed to be beautiful, right?

435
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,961
Some beautiful actress or a supermodel,
anyone you like.

436
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,402
And I'll prove that anyone
can be categorised as a horse or a plate.

437
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:26,955
Not just the women in the front row tonight.
Anyone you like?

438
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,197
-Nicole Kidman.
-Nicole Kidman.

439
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:32,315
That's a tough one. She's gorgeous.

440
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:36,078
Nicole Kidman. Oh, no.

441
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:39,724
Actually, do you know what?
It's not everyone, is it?

442
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:41,399
Now that I've heard you explain it properly,

443
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:44,638
I realise what an absolute
bunch of m****** we've got in tonight.

444
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:48,003
<i>Y</i>ou've explained it so clearly. She's got a point.

445
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:53,238
So, all right, let's play a different game.
What about the pet game? Have you got any pets?

446
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,079
I read a book recently, <i>The Psychology of Pets.</i>

447
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,158
The kind of pet you've got
determines the type of person you are.

448
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,807
I don't know if you knew that.
<i>Y</i>ou tell me the pet, I'll tell you the person.

449
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:01,957
-A cat.
-Cat. Do you know what that means?

450
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:06,165
A very loving person, very honest and very open.

451
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,440
And as a result you're very popular
with the opposite sex.

452
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:11,483
<i>Y</i>ou're very good in bed.

453
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,720
I've got a cat.

454
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:18,643
-So what's your cat called?
-She-Ra?

455
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:22,640
-She-Ra? How old is She-Ra?
-Six.

456
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:26,800
Six, with a big question mark at the end.
''Six? Two? I dunno, I'm not bothered any more.

457
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:29,401
''I can't find it.
He painted the room black and white once,

458
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,559
''never f****** seen him since.''

459
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:34,638
Cats are great.
<i>Y</i>ou ever watched a cat clean itself?

460
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:37,639
They're fantastic. They're so in control.
''I'm a cat, I'm in control.

461
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:39,843
''I can clean any part of my body I like. Test me.

462
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:42,805
''The ears, the head, the tail, the legs.
<i>Y</i>ou test me, I'll clean it.

463
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:45,481
'''Cause I'm a cat, and I'm in control.''

464
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:51,563
And then it all goes t***-up
when they clean that bit just under the neck.

465
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,479
''I can't do this bit!''

466
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:59,721
I like getting cat food
and just tickling him under the chin.

467
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:05,483
At what point in cat evolution
will they work out that if they can do this,

468
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,400
all right, that they can probably do this?

469
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,480
''F****** hell!

470
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:16,523
''Three million years, look. It's just that.''

471
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:20,879
I love speaking to people in the front row.
<i>Y</i>ou never quite know what's gonna happen.

472
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:24,323
The worst hecklers, by the way,
are not the hecklers, they're the whisperers.

473
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,477
If you hear people whispering on the front row,
it gets to me.

474
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,161
I'm so paranoid. I'm so paranoid,
you know the man on the news that says,

475
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:31,158
''If you don't wanna know the results,
look away now.''

476
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:34,683
I'm always convinced he's going,
''<i>Y</i>ou f****** w*****.

477
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,764
''Here's the weather.''

478
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,759
I said to some bloke...
It was brilliant, the other day.

479
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:45,999
I said to him, ''What do you do for a living?''
He went, ''S***!''

480
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:49,523
I said, ''What, you s*** for a living?''
He went, ''No, you, you're s***!''

481
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,677
I said, ''Do you think you're hard?''
And he went, ''<i>Y</i>eah, I do.''

482
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,520
I said, ''How hard do you think you are?''
He said, ''I'm a black belt in judo.''

483
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:56,518
And I said, ''<i>Y</i>ou might think
that's the best form of defence.

484
00:26:56,607 --> 00:27:00,361
''How often do you get attacked
by a man in a dressing gown?''

485
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:04,405
And he said, ''I work in a mental hospital.''

486
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:09,321
<i>Y</i>ou couldn't write stuff like that, could you? Eh?

487
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:11,523
Of course you could. I did.

488
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:16,759
<i>Y</i>ou always get asked this in this job,
''Did you always want to do stand-up?''

489
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:19,315
I'll be honest, I got involved in stand-up
'cause I thought,

490
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:22,285
''Stand-up comedy, sex, drugs, rock and roll.''

491
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:28,046
If I'm gonna be honest, it's ended up being
w******, cough mixture and <i>B</i>illy Ray Cyrus.

492
00:27:28,127 --> 00:27:31,164
Everyone wants to know how you got started.
I got started at school.

493
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:34,319
I was always the one that would argue
with the teachers. I was always cheeky.

494
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:35,920
I remember once this teacher said to us,

495
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:39,283
''There's an easy way to remember
how to spell possesses, a little rhyme.

496
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,437
''Possesses, possesses, five S's.''

497
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,564
''Possesses, possesses, five S's.''
She was so pleased with herself.

498
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,558
I stood up and went,
''<i>Y</i>eah, that's a lovely little rhyme, miss,

499
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:50,162
''but there's one word in the rhyme
that doesn't rhyme. And that's 'five'.

500
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,807
''It could be anything, couldn't it?
Possesses, possesses, four S's.

501
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:55,321
''Possesses, possesses, three S's.''

502
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:59,525
She went, ''<i>Y</i>eah, that's a good point, Lee.

503
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:03,395
''<i>B</i>ut the trick with the rhyme
is to remember that it's five.''

504
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:10,160
I said, ''If I could remember that bit, miss,
I wouldn't need the f****** rhyme, would I?''

505
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:14,796
The PE teachers are the worst.
They're hypocrites, aren't they, the PE teachers.

506
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:19,119
<i>Y</i>ou'd be doing your best in cross country running,
wouldn't you? Going...

507
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:22,642
Then suddenly the PE teacher would jump
out from the bushes and go,

508
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:25,924
''Hey! Don't walk! Run!''

509
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,115
<i>Y</i>et the same bloke, two hours later,
when you were going for your dinner,

510
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:33,678
running down the corridor, he'd jump out and go,
''Oi! Don't run! Walk!''

511
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,800
And yet the same bloke, two hours later.
<i>Y</i>ou'd be in detention, wouldn't you?

512
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:40,684
And he'd go, ''Oi! Don't just sit there!

513
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,883
''Come here now
and pull down your little blue panties.''

514
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:47,119
Forget this joke. It's none of your business.
The point I'm trying to make is...

515
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:50,005
They used to hit us as well.
Did you ever get hit from the teachers at school?

516
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:51,600
Whack us like that, really hard.

517
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:53,962
Table tennis bats,
that's what they used to love doing.

518
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:56,038
I remember once, right, he hit us so hard.
It used to be agony.

519
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,278
<i>B</i>ut then about three weeks later, we got
this supply teacher in and he was brilliant.

520
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:00,925
He was Chinese, right.

521
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,679
So, what he used to do,
instead of hitting us really hard,

522
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:06,043
he used to just come in at funny angles like that.

523
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:14,283
We thought it was brilliant.
This doesn't hurt. It's just...

524
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,801
What we didn't realise
was he was putting lots of spin on, right?

525
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:19,196
So we thought it didn't hurt,
but when we sat down...

526
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:23,280
Whizzed off our seats, banged our f****** heads.
He was a genius.

527
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,157
<i>Y</i>ou do get asked the same questions in this job.

528
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:32,206
Two blokes came backstage,
asked me the classic question the other day.

529
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,243
''Do you do refunds?''
''No.''

530
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:38,959
They said, ''Listen, Lee, you're a comedian, right.

531
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:42,244
''In fact, you're a great comedian.
In fact, you're a genius.

532
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:44,966
''The way you tell jokes
that make us think differently about the world.

533
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:46,321
''It makes us want to be better people, too.

534
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:48,841
''We don't know how you do it
and you're not a bad looking fellow, either.''

535
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:50,883
''Tell us this,'' they said.

536
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:54,004
''Who inspires you?''

537
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,802
Do you know what I said to these two blokes?

538
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:59,718
I said, ''Nelson Mandela.''

539
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:02,558
I said, ''Stephen Hawking.''

540
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:07,645
''The pair of you, get out of my dressing room.
Stop asking me stupid questions.''

541
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,878
''We're only trying to make polite conversation.''

542
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:14,845
''<i>Y</i>es, you f****** rude t***.''

543
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:18,681
I'm not very good at the Stephen Hawking thing.
I can do the voice but I can't get rid of the accent.

544
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,565
Do you wanna know about
life, the universe and everything? Do you?

545
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:24,036
Tough s***. Me day off. F*** off.

546
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:29,202
<i>B</i>ut, you know, this is the truth, right.
This is the truth.

547
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,235
Do you know who really inspires me?

548
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:35,923
Do you know who really inspires me? I'll tell you.

549
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,201
My dad.

550
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:39,156
AUDIENCE: Aw.

551
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:42,922
I know what you're thinking.
''Come on, Lee, you don't know who your dad is.''

552
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:47,398
<i>B</i>ut I do. My dad's the most...
He's the funniest man in the world, my dad.

553
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:50,957
Kind of bloke that could read out
a telephone directory and it'd be funny.

554
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:54,517
I mean, to be fair,
he used to do it with his c*** out.

555
00:30:56,847 --> 00:31:01,523
<i>B</i>ut it wasn't quite as funny
when he started phoning people, let me tell you.

556
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,122
He's great my dad. Very old-fashioned man.

557
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:07,801
He was so old-fashioned
that when my sister had her menstrual cycle,

558
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:10,845
he made her go and live in the shed,
claiming she was the evil seed of Satan.

559
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:13,236
''That's a bit old-fashioned, Dad.''

560
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,319
Very sad. Actually my sister died very young.

561
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:19,680
She drowned.

562
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:22,563
<i>B</i>ut, you know, like my dad said,
''Look on the bright side.

563
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:27,198
''If she'd have floated,
we would have had to set fire to her anyway.'' So...

564
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:31,401
I actually left home when I was 34.

565
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,205
It's me mum, she was ill.

566
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:36,199
<i>Y</i>eah, you're not laughing now, are you?

567
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:37,879
It's very sad actually.

568
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:41,277
My mum actually got to the point where
she couldn't look after herself.

569
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,039
She couldn't cook.

570
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:44,765
She couldn't wash.

571
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:46,565
She couldn't clean.

572
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:49,641
It was at that point, I thought,
''Well, there's nothing in it for me.''

573
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:51,285
F***** right off.

574
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,560
She's great my mum. She used to always
support me... This is a true story.

575
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,684
I got picked on at school
'cause I had frostbite and I lost most of me toes.

576
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,042
<i>B</i>ut my mum was always still there for me.

577
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,083
At night she'd still sing those little songs.

578
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,601
''This little piggy went to market.

579
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,519
''Good night, love.''

580
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:13,116
I used to get teased a lot by me brother,
said I was adopted.

581
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,243
Did you ever get that at school? ''<i>Y</i>ou're adopted!''

582
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:17,158
My brother used to say it all the time
in the playground.

583
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:18,521
I used to cry. Honestly, I was so upset.

584
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:21,838
I cried so hard once, me dad come up to me...
He was brilliant, my dad.

585
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:24,395
He put his arm round me like that,
and do you know what he said?

586
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:27,320
(IN CHINESE ACCENT) ''<i>Y</i>ou don't listen to him!
He bad boy! He lie! <i>Y</i>ou my son!

587
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:29,363
''He very bad lie-boy.

588
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:34,202
''<i>Y</i>ou go loom, no lies! Very bad lie-boy.
<i>Y</i>ou my son.''

589
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,119
I'm obsessed with the Chinese accent.

590
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,801
See, Chinese, it's the most difficult language
in the world to learn.

591
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:44,766
In fact, I think it is so difficult to learn Chinese,
I don't even think Chinese understand it.

592
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:47,566
'Cause if you go to China,
they repeat it in English at the train stations

593
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,319
after they've announced it in Chinese.

594
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:52,240
That's not for our benefit.
I don't even think it's for their benefit.

595
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,557
I think the bloke announcing it
has just given up halfway.

596
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:56,080
I think he's just going...

597
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,840
(SPEAKING MOCK CHINESE)

598
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:04,237
''Next train leave in 1 0 minutes.
I can't f****** do this. It too difficult.

599
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,045
''Why can't we use the alphabet?

600
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:10,723
''All these squiggly line. It very hard.
Don't like it. <i>B</i>ye, Mr Wangtong.''

601
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:14,766
Hello, madam, with the thing going on.

602
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:19,206
<i>Y</i>ou there, with the... Not you, mate.
I'm not looking at you, am I? F*** me.

603
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:20,879
Most people don't mention the lazy eye.

604
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:24,084
<i>Y</i>ou all right? <i>Y</i>es, you at the back, in the top.

606
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,523
Ooh, that hurt, that.

607
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,519
<i>Y</i>ou with the thing on.
And the going on thing with the glasses.

608
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:34,676
-Hello.
-Hello.

609
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:35,995
-How are you doing?
-Very well.

610
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:37,725
-Are you in a relationship?
-No.

611
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,446
Me neither. I was lying before. Hello.

612
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:43,519
The wise man said, ''If you love somebody,
you've got to let them go.''

613
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,246
Actually, they didn't say that, they said,
''If you love her, let her go!

614
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:49,285
''Then come out with your hands on your head!''

615
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:55,559
-And what's your name, madam?
-Gemma.

616
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,922
Gemma. Can I call you Gem?

617
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:59,725
'Cause I'm Lee, so you don't... It's great being Lee.

618
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,718
<i>Y</i>ou don't any get nicknames
in the playground, which was good.

619
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:05,277
Apart from ''Lee-Lee, stinks of wee''.
That never bothered me.

620
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:07,005
And if I'm gonna be honest,
my middle name's Gordon.

621
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,920
So, I used to get...
# Gordon is a moron #

622
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,522
So I'd get,
# Lee, Lee, sticks of wee and he is a moron

623
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:14,835
# Mack #

624
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,078
<i>B</i>ut they're not laughing now, are they?
They were over 35 quid, these shoes.

625
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:21,000
And if I'm gonna be honest,
my surname's not really Mack, it's MacKillop.

626
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,122
So I used to get,

627
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,846
# Lee MacKillop, silly little pillock
He's a little moron, stinks of wee wee

628
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:28,556
# 36 years old, get out of our playground
you dirty old pervert #

629
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,957
Just a little thing that they used to sing.
I never really got it.

630
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:35,403
See, names are very important, aren't they?
That's why we won the Rugby World Cup.

631
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:38,240
'Cause of one name, Jonny Wilkinson.

632
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:41,364
What a great name that is, isn't it? Jonny...
Got rugby fans in?

633
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,199
I'm not a big rugby fan
but doesn't it move your spirit

634
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:45,881
when they all start singing
<i>Swing Low Sweet Chariot?</i>

635
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:49,039
Nothing moves my spirit more than hearing
35,000 white middle-class people

636
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:51,436
singing a black slave song. Gets you right...

637
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:53,995
Don't be embarrassed, mate.
The black slaves were just as bad.

638
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:58,046
They used to sing Dire Straits numbers,
so it's swings and roundabouts.

639
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:04,399
<i>B</i>ut, Jonny, how much of a proper rugby name
is that? Jonny Wilkinson.

640
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,205
What a macho rugby name that is.

641
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:09,643
Named after the two most macho products
you can get on the <i>B</i>ritish market.

642
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:12,446
The rubber condom and the triple-headed razor.

643
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,803
What was the Australian flyhalf called?
Elton Flatley.

644
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:20,563
That's not quite as hard, is it, when you're
named after the two campest men in showbiz.

645
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:23,480
Jonny Wilkinson's got all these moves going on
and their bloke's just going...

646
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,159
# Rocket man

647
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:27,078
# Daniel, my brother #

648
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,883
That's my vague attempt at <i>Riverdance</i>
in case you're wondering what that is, by the way.

649
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:34,276
It's very easy to do <i>Riverdance.</i>
<i>Y</i>ou just gotta stand there going,

650
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:36,927
(IN IRISH ACCENT) ''Can you smell dog s***?
Seamus, can you smell dog s***?

651
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:39,840
''Who stood in dog s***? Is it you? Is it me?
Is it me? It's f****** me.

652
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:42,680
''I stood in dog s*** again. I hate that s***.

653
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,359
''I hate that.''

654
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,195
Don't make the mistake I made.

655
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,243
If you ever go and see <i>Riverdance,</i>
never buy the cheap tickets.

656
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:51,885
I went to see <i>Riverdance,</i> 1 0 quid to get in.

657
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:54,083
I remember thinking that's very cheap,
big West End show.

658
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:56,442
The reason why is you end up sitting
at the back of the room,

659
00:35:56,527 --> 00:35:59,166
and the seats at the back are lower down
than the ones in the front.

660
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:01,681
I'm trying to watch the show,
I've got all these big heads in front of me

661
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:04,406
and I could only see the dancers
from the waist up.

662
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:08,196
Now, I'm a big fan of Irish dancing,
don't get me wrong,

663
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:11,359
but it's not exactly known
for that upper body enthusiasm, is it?

664
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:14,405
I spent two hours watching Michael Flatley
going like this.

665
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:25,322
These are sound effects, by the way,
that's not his c***.

666
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:27,883
I managed to see that.

667
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:33,439
I thought that was it.
I thought that's how you impress Irish people.

668
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:38,078
<i>Y</i>ou can imagine my embarrassment
on the dance floor a few weeks later in Dublin.

669
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:41,125
I met this girl. I was chatting her up
in my usual classy, Northern way.

670
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:43,721
''All right, love. Are you an electrician?''

671
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:47,197
She went, ''Why?'' I said, ''When you came in
the room tonight, you gave off a certain spark

672
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:50,279
''that sent a current racing through my body.''

673
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:53,805
And she said, ''Are you a fishmonger?''
I said, ''Why?''

674
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:56,685
And she said, '''Cause you f****** stink.''

675
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:02,402
<i>B</i>ut it didn't put me off, I said,
''Come on, let's dance. This will impress you.''

676
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,686
-Have we got any Irish people in, by the way?
-<i>Y</i>eah!

677
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,405
Whereabouts in Ireland? Here's one for you.

678
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,399
How many Protestants does it take
to change a light bulb? One. They're brilliant.

679
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:13,478
<i>B</i>ut how many Catholics does it take
to change a light bulb?

680
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:17,799
One. They're brilliant, too.
Hello. Please don't hurt me. Good night.

681
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:20,882
-Whereabouts in Ireland are you from?
-Cork.

682
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,844
-<i>Y</i>ou're from Cone?
-Cork.

683
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:24,201
-Cold?
-Cork.

684
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:25,766
-Court?
-Cork.

685
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,565
Cork. Oh, right!

686
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:30,923
F*** me, you really are Cockney, aren't you? Cork!

687
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:35,606
(IN COCKNE<i>Y</i> ACCENT) Oh, f****** started again.
F***! Cork. Cork.

688
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:39,521
Oh, f***. I've gone... I've f****** gone Cork.
Cork. F***.

689
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:43,236
Help me. I'm melting, Dorothy, I'm melting.
Cork. Cork!

690
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,835
Cork, you silly Cockney c***. Cork.

691
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,284
I'm gonna have to work
on me catchphrases, aren't I?

692
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:55,517
Wouldn't it be great
if <i>B</i>ruce Forsyth chatted to people like this?

693
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,279
''Where you from? Where you from?

694
00:37:57,367 --> 00:38:00,359
''Cork, you silly Cockney c***. My God.

695
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,962
''I'll tell you, you can't f****** do anything. C****!

696
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:07,403
''F*** me. I don't know.
Haven't got all f****** day.''

697
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,315
Ireland.

698
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,880
Ireland's brilliant. Ireland's the best place
in the world to do gigs.

699
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:14,923
I'm used to living in London,
you know what that's like.

700
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:16,076
''Hello, have you got the right time?''

701
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:21,082
''F*** off! I ain't got time for anything.
Especially you, you c***. <i>Y</i>ou f****** c***.''

702
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:26,006
I don't know why I keep doing that. I've been
watching lots of Tommy Steele films recently.

703
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,486
I love Tommy Steele films.

704
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,603
They just sing about anything
for no apparent reason.

705
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:32,076
''Oh, look, Tommy's dropped his pencil
on the floor.'' ''He's done what?''

706
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:34,283
''He's dropped his pencil on the floor.''
''He's done what?''

707
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:37,598
# He's dropped his bloomin' pencil on the floor

708
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:40,997
# Oh, Tommy's dropped his pencil on the... #

709
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:44,446
When I first went to London,
I thought that's all Cockneys did.

710
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:46,563
I just got off the train thinking,
''Wow, this is London.''

711
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:49,081
People were coming up to me going,
''Have you got the time?'' I was going,

712
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,680
# Have I got the time? Have I got the time?

713
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:54,077
# I'll tell you the f****** time
It's after three #

714
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:56,084
''F*** off, you Northern c***.''

715
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,805
# Oh, he called me a c***

716
00:38:57,887 --> 00:39:01,084
# He don't mean no harm
He's just having a laugh #

717
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,280
(GROANING)

718
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:11,883
# Oh, I'm bleeding to death
Phone the ambulance #

719
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:19,596
Got into a fight with him, ended up in court.

720
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:21,882
(ENUNCIATING) Sorry, ''court''.

721
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,436
It's different in Ireland.
It's, ''Have you got the right time?''

722
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:26,562
(IN IRISH ACCENT) ''Oh, yes, I do.

723
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:28,558
''And I've also got
a lovely roast chicken in the oven at home.

724
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:30,399
''Would you come back, meet the wife,

725
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:33,638
''you can sleep with her if you like,
we're all f****** friendly.''

726
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:37,003
I say it's friendly.
I actually got mugged in Limerick.

727
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:40,238
That's the place, by the way, not the style.

728
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:42,401
I don't mean someone came up to me and went,

729
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:44,443
''Hello, my name is Pete
I'm standing in the street

730
00:39:44,527 --> 00:39:46,597
''Don't be rash, give me your cash
Or I'll boot you in the teeth''

731
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:49,155
''Hello there, Officer
Is that the police?

732
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:51,442
''Hello, my name is Lee
A man is mugging me

733
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:54,041
''<i>B</i>ring your stick and hit him quick
Come on, he's getting free''

734
00:39:56,247 --> 00:40:00,798
I don't do a lot of travelling.
I'll be honest, I'm a bit of an Anglophile.

735
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:04,038
That's not the same as a paedophile, by the way.

736
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:07,436
I only touch up fishermen's kids.

737
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:12,317
That's a very odd reaction.

738
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,477
Half of you outraged
by the concept of paedophilia,

739
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:18,320
the other half going, ''Please, no puns.''

740
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,846
Tell you who annoy me at the moment, the French.

741
00:40:21,927 --> 00:40:24,282
Do you remember what they said
about our Olympic bid?

742
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:27,484
''Oh, you can't have the Olympics in England.''
''Why is that?''

743
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,719
''<i>B</i>ecause your food's crap.''
''Oh, is that right, Mr Froggy Cousteau?

744
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:35,561
''I don't care what you think about...''

745
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:39,322
If there's any French people in the audience
tonight, laugh all you like about our crappy food.

746
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:42,604
<i>Y</i>ou lot will never have the pleasure
of coming home as a 1 4-year-old boy

747
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:46,566
thinking you're only getting beans on toast
and then going, ''Oh, hello.

748
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:49,115
''There's little sausages in there.''

749
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:55,717
<i>Y</i>ou can't win with the French.
I went to a French restaurant recently,

750
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:57,559
I thought, ''I'll make the effort,
I'll order in French.''

751
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:59,160
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

752
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:03,877
Me dad taught me that just before he was jailed
in Italy for killing 20,000 Christians.

753
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,720
This waiter came in
and I was trying to order the egg custard.

754
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:11,323
And I said, ''Have you got, <i>le creme d'oeuf?''</i>

755
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:16,435
And this waiter went, ''It's not <i>le creme d'oeuf.</i>

756
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:20,877
''It's <i>la creme d'oeuf.</i>

757
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,759
''It's feminine.''

758
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,995
I said, ''It's not feminine, is it?

759
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:35,883
''It's an egg custard.

760
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,683
''What do I need to know the sex
of an egg custard for?

761
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:49,319
''I want to eat it.

00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,046
''Not f*** it.

763
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:57,679
''Excuse the French.''

764
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:01,561
I shouldn't swear in my act.

765
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,241
My nan used to say, ''Don't swear in your act.
Don't even say God. Say gosh.

766
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:05,601
''Only say God if you want to talk to him.

767
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:08,155
''Otherwise you'll distract him
from helping the poor.''

768
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:09,885
I used to say, ''It's a good point, Nan.

769
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:13,960
''<i>B</i>ut put some clothes on and
get out of the f****** wheelbarrow.''

770
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:17,883
I remember the last thing she said to me
just before she died.

771
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:20,083
She said, ''What are you doing in here
with that hammer?''

772
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:21,885
No. Do you know what she said?

773
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:24,242
She was mental. I had to do it.

774
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,523
She used to say things like,
''Here's ?5, don't tell your mother.''

775
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:30,724
I'd say, ''Why not?'' And she'd say, ''It's hers.''

776
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:37,759
She was great. She used to say things like,
''Red sky at night, Angel Delight.

777
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:42,600
''Red sky in the morning, Angel Delight.''

778
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:46,484
She was obsessed with Angel Delight.
''Stop it, Nan, we can't afford the milk.''

779
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,239
''F*** you, I'll snort it.''

780
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:51,522
All right?

781
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:54,797
She was great, my nan.

782
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:57,117
She had a great way with words.
It was very sad once.

783
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:00,563
My grandad went into this home.
Very sad, wasn't his home.

784
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:04,196
''Go on, Grandad, get us a telly.''
No, it was very sad.

785
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:08,684
He went into this home, right.
And we rang up. Very, very sad.

786
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:12,720
I said, ''How is he getting on in the home?''
She went, ''Oh, he's like a fish out of water.''

787
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:14,923
I said, ''Is he finding it hard to adjust?''

788
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:17,077
She said, ''No, he's dead.''

789
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:21,681
She was mental.

790
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,679
I once found the worst possible thing to find
under a grandmother's bed.

791
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,962
Do you know what I found? Wacky backy.

792
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:30,483
<i>Y</i>eah. It wasn't the drug,
the Sri Lankan wicketkeeper.

793
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:36,839
My favourite one of all was,
''Find a penny, pick it up.

794
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:38,724
''And all day long,

795
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:40,445
''Angel Delight!''

796
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:43,084
<i>B</i>ut do you know what?

797
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:46,561
That's not how I remember the old wizened w****.

798
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:50,196
I remember I went to see her as a little boy.

799
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:53,520
I said, ''Don't dress as a little boy, Nan.
It's not you.''

800
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:55,837
I went to see her as a little...
''I love the Krankies.''

801
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:58,236
''I don't care. It's actually humiliating.''

802
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:01,558
I went to see her as a little boy.
She was great. She always used to give me advice.

803
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:03,763
I remember once she taught me
that there was a very fine line

804
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:06,407
between the Heimlich manoeuvre and sodomy.

805
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,561
To be fair, it wasn't just her.
The magistrate told me that as well.

806
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,161
What was it he said again?
''<i>Y</i>ou can only use it on strangers in the public

807
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:16,363
''if they are choking on a solid object
or a piece of food.''

808
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:19,564
And not, apparently,
if they're just stood alone at a bus stop,

809
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:22,525
looking coy but strangely available, eh?

810
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:23,835
Come on!

811
00:44:24,647 --> 00:44:27,878
<i>B</i>ut I did ask for some advice once.

812
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:32,516
I remember saying to her, ''Nan, it's a crazy world.

813
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:35,400
''What is love?''

814
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:38,965
My nan told me something I'll never forget.

815
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:45,762
She said, ''<i>Y</i>ou know, I've always thought of it
as something very natural and very organic.

816
00:44:46,327 --> 00:44:49,763
''Oh, yes! On the outside, it's tough.

817
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:54,164
''And it's ugly and it's hard.

818
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:59,526
''<i>B</i>ut let it grow naturally and look inside.

819
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:02,678
''And you'll see it's soft

820
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:05,839
''and it's gentle.''

821
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:10,795
And I said, ''That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

822
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,567
''Do you really believe that's what love is?''

823
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,444
And she said, ''Love?

824
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:19,040
''I'm sorry. I thought you said a melon.''

825
00:45:24,527 --> 00:45:25,801
Did you ever do that thing when you were a kid

826
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,447
where you try and swear in front of your nan
to try and impress your mates?

827
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:31,041
How many swear words can you get in
without Nan noticing?

828
00:45:31,127 --> 00:45:33,436
<i>B</i>e like, ''Anyone for coffee? Anyone f*** off-ee?

829
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:36,166
''Is it half a cup? Ha-f*** up, is it?

830
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:38,638
''What time is it?'' ''Tampax two.''
''Tampax two?''

831
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:40,797
''Durex expect me to believe that?''
''It's jolly well possible.''

832
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:42,923
''Anyone f*** off-ee, Nan?''

833
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:46,919
The last time we tried it
we were in a Chinese restaurant.

834
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:49,521
''Oh, Nan, there's no fork and knife.
What we gonna do?

835
00:45:49,607 --> 00:45:53,520
''Nan, there's no fork and knife.
Nan, there's no fork and knife.

836
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:55,359
''What we gonna do?'' She went, ''I don't know.

837
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:59,998
''Try and use the fork and chopsticks,
you patronising pair of little c****.''

838
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:05,358
That was her attitude. If you can't beat them,
what's the point in having kids?

839
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:08,637
I'm obsessed with swearing.
I'm absolutely obsessed with it.

840
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:12,436
On TV you can't swear till 9:30.
Then after that you can do what you want. Why?

841
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:15,166
I think the <i>BB</i>C think, as a nation,
we're all just stood round going,

842
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:20,367
''Oh, Marjorie, could you possibly pass me
the bread sauce? This fish is simply divine.''

843
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,883
''Why, certainly, Kenneth.
It really is a tasty salmon.

844
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:26,722
''Tell me, my darling, are you aware of the time?''

845
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:30,197
''Why, allow me to check on
my small, pocket, antique, silver wristwatch

846
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,075
''left for me by Grandpapa
all of these years ago in his will.

847
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:38,481
''Why, I believe it has just gone the hour of 9:30.

848
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:42,480
''Thank f*** for that. Let's get c*****
and s*** on the Christmas tree, you dirty b****.''

849
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:46,162
# F*** your auntie up the w********
S***, b****, f****, f*** #

850
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:50,642
Look out for this song.
I'm bringing it out at Christmas.

851
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:56,438
My favourite swear word at the moment,
right, my favourite is ''motherf*****''.

852
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,040
Great swear word, that, innit? Motherf*****.

853
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:00,641
I particularly like ''bad motherf*****''.

854
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:03,366
What a great phrase that is. <i>B</i>ad motherf*****.

855
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:07,440
If ever there was a reason not to use the word
''bad'', it's before the word ''motherf*****''.

856
00:47:07,527 --> 00:47:10,439
<i>Y</i>ou see, I can't help thinking,
if you f*** your mum, right,

857
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,997
it doesn't really matter
how good or bad you are at it.

858
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:17,167
I can't imagine anyone being
swayed by the adjective, can you?

859
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,680
''See that bloke over there?''
''<i>Y</i>eah.''

860
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:20,200
''He f**** his mum.''
''So?''

861
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,039
''Wait, there's more.

862
00:47:23,327 --> 00:47:25,966
''He's really bad at it.''
''Oh! Well, that is a disgrace!''

863
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:28,925
''Make an effort if you're gonna f*** your mum.
Put some candles round the bath.

864
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:32,124
''Come on! Have some self-respect,
you bad motherf*****, eh?

865
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:33,640
''West Side.''

866
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:37,846
The swearing in London's worse.

867
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:39,724
I went to a cocktail bar the other day with my wife

868
00:47:39,807 --> 00:47:42,196
and I could not believe the names
they've got for cocktails down here.

869
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:46,599
Shocked, right?
They had one called Sex on a <i>B</i>each.

870
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,006
Oh, hello.

871
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:52,882
They had one called
a Slow Comfortable Screw. <i>Y</i>es.

872
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:58,365
They even had one called an Orgasm.

873
00:47:58,447 --> 00:47:59,766
(GASPING)

874
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:04,085
We couldn't make our minds up what to have.

875
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:10,235
In the end, my wife went for something called
a Fist-F*** off a Waiter Named Tony.

876
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:17,602
And I had... What did I have?
Half a mild. Lovely night.

877
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:26,723
I do like drinking, though.
Not too much, you know,

878
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:29,605
just till the screaming in me head stops.

879
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:35,119
I do it for the taste and the aroma.

880
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:37,202
Mmm.

881
00:48:37,807 --> 00:48:40,196
I'm getting p*****.

882
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:46,519
I've got a confession to make, actually.
I'm drinking and driving tonight.

883
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:48,199
<i>Y</i>eah. F*** them.

884
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,517
There's an advertising campaign
you won't see this Christmas.

885
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:55,165
Everyone says it's wrong, drinking and driving.

886
00:48:55,247 --> 00:48:57,966
I can tell you two things that are more dangerous
than drinking and driving.

887
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:01,722
One, drinking. Two, driving.

888
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:03,843
Do you know how many people
were killed last year in <i>B</i>ritain

889
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:06,839
as a direct result of alcohol abuse? 35,000.

890
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:10,681
Do you know how many people were killed
as a direct result of driving a car? 22,000.

891
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:15,921
Do you know how many people were killed
as direct result of drinking and driving? 500.

892
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:21,355
I'm not taking any f****** chances.

893
00:49:25,887 --> 00:49:27,798
Do you know how many people
were killed last year in <i>B</i>ritain

894
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:31,323
as direct result of drinking
and driving and juggling?

895
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:35,562
Two. <i>Y</i>eah, I'm not saying it's completely safe.

896
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:42,318
I'm not telling you how to live your lives.
I'm just here to give you the statistics.

897
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:45,683
<i>Y</i>ou make your own minds up. All I will say is,
if you're drinking and driving tonight,

898
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:48,281
three tennis balls in the glove box.

899
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:52,685
''<i>B</i>een drinking, have we, sir?''
''A little bit. I went to see Lee Mack

900
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:56,282
''and everything appears to be
under control, thank you.

901
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:58,802
''Ooh!

902
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:00,764
''Dropped one, cheeky.

903
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:04,404
''Don't you run away.''

904
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:08,881
Actually, I'm not condoning it.
It's wrong to drink and drive. It is for me.

905
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,435
I haven't got a licence. It is wrong, isn't it?

906
00:50:11,527 --> 00:50:13,643
Can anyone answer this question?
I was on me driving test,

907
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,605
and this is why I failed,
I was driving along and suddenly...

908
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:20,236
If an animal runs out in front of the car,
what are you supposed to do in your test?

909
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:22,363
-Does anyone know the right answer?
-Hit it.

910
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:27,396
Hit it. It's actually run it over,
but give it that violent edge, why don't you?

911
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:29,921
The correct answer is
you got to continue to drive and run it over

912
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:32,043
'cause anything else
is a danger to other road users.

913
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:37,485
I'm on my test, everything is going great,
suddenly this goat ran out in front of the car,

914
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,446
so I remembered what he said, and I kept driving.

915
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:44,963
Few seconds later, I look in the rear-view mirror.

916
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:50,724
The goat is fine. I've missed him by millimetres.

917
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:55,884
Now, obviously, I didn't want to fail me test.

918
00:50:56,927 --> 00:50:59,521
So I slapped it in reverse, like that.
I must have been chasing him

919
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:03,282
through that field for 45 minutes
before I ran over his head, and he still failed me.

920
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:05,517
Where's the justice in that?

921
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:08,726
I don't know anything about cars, really.
I have passed me test now.

922
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:13,039
In fact, all I know about cars
is the bigger the car, the smaller your willy.

923
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:17,006
I've got a mini. So I have to drive a really big car.

924
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:22,885
I've never understood cars. I never know
what Jeremy Clarkson's going on about.

925
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,685
Every time I turn the TV on,
he's just looking at me going,

926
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:28,919
''If I said to you, 'Shetak Fertango,'
you'd say, 'Excessive rear-end flange injection

927
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:31,282
'''and overly-keen knocking valves.'''

928
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:35,679
No, Jeremy, I'd say, ''Has it got a cup holder?
Will it make birds touch me c***?''

929
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:39,237
The day I buy a brand-new car is when
they've got the honesty to just do a real advert

930
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:41,966
and just say,
''The new Audi Doody. It's quicker than walking

931
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:45,517
''and you won't have to
sit next to a pikey on the bus.''

932
00:51:49,487 --> 00:51:51,000
Do you do that thing as well?
When you're driving along,

933
00:51:51,127 --> 00:51:53,163
I shove the phone between my legs,
I don't know if you do this.

934
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:56,284
I'm texting away... My girlfriend says
I shouldn't do that 'cause of the radiation.

935
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:59,359
I just think, ''F*** it, the phone's insured.''

936
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:02,440
I'm trying to do this thing
where I'm trying to turn off predictive texting.

937
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:04,165
Why have we got predictive texting?

938
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:07,319
Why do we need it? We're not predictive talking,
why do we need predictive writing?

939
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:09,716
It'd be great if we did have predictive talking.
That'd be brilliant.

940
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,286
''Where'd you go today?''
''Today? Me?

941
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:14,484
''I wallabyed, I w*****, I washed, I walked.
I can't turn it off.

942
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:18,879
''Tip, top, to!
I walked to the Sharon's, the ships, the shops!

943
00:52:19,007 --> 00:52:23,080
''I walked to the shops.
I can't turn it off. Predictive thinking.''

944
00:52:24,287 --> 00:52:26,198
I reckon that's what Tourette's is.

945
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:29,438
Tourette's is just predictive talking
that people can't turn off.

946
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:31,836
''What'd you have for your dinner?''
''F*** off... Fish and chips.

947
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:35,522
''And mushy c***... Peas! Mushy peas!
I can't turn it off!''

948
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,681
Did I really say ''mushy c****'', then?

949
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:47,764
Sit down! Sit down now, you hoody freak.
Get back. Get back.

950
00:52:47,847 --> 00:52:51,203
Get back now. P*** on the seat
and do what the others have done.

951
00:52:51,287 --> 00:52:54,120
<i>Y</i>ou thought I didn't f****** notice.
<i>Y</i>ou're like, ''Should I go? Should I go?

952
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:58,166
''Should I go? Should I go?
He's mid-joke. He'll never get me now.

953
00:52:58,247 --> 00:52:59,600
''Oh, s***.''

954
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:05,564
F****** great. I got to wait now. He's paid.

955
00:53:06,887 --> 00:53:09,162
-Part of the rules. I gotta wait.
-Time him.

956
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,206
What? Time him? Very competitive bloke response.

957
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:14,925
''Time him. Go on, time him.

958
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:19,046
''I'll see if I can beat him
and we'll have a mini-league. Time him.''

959
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:24,999
<i>B</i>et you're f****** great fun to be at home with.
''I'm just gonna go for a p***.''

960
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:29,000
''Oh, great, I'll time you.
See if you can beat your personal record.

961
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:31,157
''Poo or p***, poo or p***?''

962
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:34,923
''<i>B</i>oth.''
''<i>B</i>oth, both, brilliant! We haven't done both!''

963
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:41,998
F****** time him. What a weirdo.
How is that gonna help the situation?

964
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:46,596
Three and a half minutes of silence
and no jokes as we wait.

965
00:53:46,687 --> 00:53:51,841
No laughs, but look on the bright side. We know
he was exactly three minutes and 45 seconds.

966
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:54,798
What's your name, sir?

967
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:59,202
Who said, ''Time him''?
Give me a wave if you said, ''Time him.''

968
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:02,597
-MAN: This man here.
-Oh, he's up there! F***. All right, mate?

969
00:54:02,687 --> 00:54:05,201

00:54:14,247 --> 00:54:15,839
-What's your name?
-Shane.

973
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:19,044
-Shane. And what do you do, Shane?
-Nothing.

974
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:22,722
Nothing.
What's your fastest you've ever done that?

975
00:54:27,127 --> 00:54:29,960
God bless you for trying to work that out.

976
00:54:30,407 --> 00:54:32,363
''Is that a trick question?''

977
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,836
-And how old are you?
-Seventeen.

978
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:37,680
Seventeen. Looking forward to Christmas?

979
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:45,155
Seventeen. <i>B</i>less your cotton socks.
It's quite a young-looking crowd in tonight.

980
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,717
How old are you there? Eighteen?
Am I in the right gig?

981
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:52,286
Were you expecting a clown? Is that...

982
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,879
That's what's happened. I've stumbled in...
That's why it's so brightly coloured.

983
00:54:56,967 --> 00:54:58,639
I've turned up on the wrong set.

984
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:02,197
There's probably another theatre next door.
Some clown's dying on his a***.

985
00:55:02,287 --> 00:55:05,245
''<i>B</i>igger? <i>B</i>igger?''

986
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:07,800
''F*** off, you're s***!''

987
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,196
''There's no need for that.
I'll take me custard pies and go home.''

988

(HONKING)

989
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:17,637
How'd you get back there?
How the hell did you do that?

990
00:55:18,207 --> 00:55:20,004
He was timing you, the freak.

991
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:22,237
He waits outside your bathroom
and he knows your personal best

992
00:55:22,327 --> 00:55:24,921
is three and a half minutes to have a big poo.
How f****** mental is he?

993
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:27,396
Do you know what he does? Nothing. Lazy s***.

994
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,557
-What do you do?
-I work in IT.

995

Talking of record attempts,
what's the longest you've gone in a day

998
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:43,286

1001
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:51,725
That is so immature. I'm so sorry.

1002
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,162
What's the... I won't do it again. That's childish.

1003
00:55:54,247 --> 00:55:57,956
What's the... What position are you in? Are you...

1004
00:55:58,047 --> 00:56:00,515
Wind the window down. Wind it down.

1005
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,123
Radio 4. Lots of fan.

1006
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:07,399
Do you ever do that thing when you fall...
I always do this.

1007
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:09,239

1010
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:17,160
Just as he's waking up, keep your right eye
on the road, just close your left eye.

''Watch the f****** road!''
''Are we there? Are we there?

00:56:27,607 --> 00:56:29,677

1016
00:56:42,087 --> 00:56:44,647
I knew it was gonna be a good day
this morning when I woke up.

1017
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:49,926
No, I was... I got a very good review this morning.
''Prompt and efficient payer,'' e<i>B</i>ay.

1018
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:55,117
I might not be the best comedian
you'll ever see in the world,

1019
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:56,686
but there's one thing you can guarantee from me.

1020
00:56:56,767 --> 00:57:00,123
If you buy a Haynes manual for
a 1 982 Ford Capri you know it's gonna be,

1021
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:02,482
and I quote, ''Nicely packaged.''

1022
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:06,518
I also got a phone call off the HS<i>B</i>C this morning.

1023
00:57:06,607 --> 00:57:08,086
They said,
''When you gonna pay off this overdraft?''

1024
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:10,044
I said, ''<i>Y</i>ou know what?
In some parts of Southeast Asia

1025
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:14,086
''it's considered rude
to ring people up and ask them for money.''

1026
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:19,163
He said, ''What are you talking about?''
I said, ''I don't know. <i>Y</i>ou started it.''

1027
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:22,637
My favourite adverts are those ones when you
come in at night and turn the television on,

1028
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:26,083
some bloke's just shouting at you going,
''Are you in debt? Are you in lots of debt?

1029
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,486
''Do you need to get out of debt?

1030
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:29,842
''Why not consolidate
all of your debt into one simple, easy debt?''

1031
00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:32,043
And how the f*** is that gonna help?

1032
00:57:32,127 --> 00:57:33,879
<i>Y</i>ou don't do that with
any of your other problems, do you?

''Three naughty kids? Get rid of them.
Get one, big, fat f***** and consolidate it.

''What are you on about?''
''Sign it!''

1037
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:50,800
The best adverts are the Australian ones.

1038
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:53,162
They've all gone for the mentally ill theme
for some reason.

1039
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:56,717
Go to Australia and turn the television on,
I guarantee some bloke will be shouting at you,

And I said, ''Get it right, for God's sake, Dad.''

1084
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,760
And he says,

''F*** off, you're adopted anyway.''
