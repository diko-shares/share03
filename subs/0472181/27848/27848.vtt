- Previously on
"Just Add Magic"...

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,543
- What is it?
- It's a cookbook.

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,544
My grandma's.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,514
I need you to trust
your instincts.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,515
Trust your--

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,916
Grandma.

7
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,786
I just know that
whatever is going on
with Grandma

8
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,854
has something to do
 with the book.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,290
She's under a spell.

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,992
We need to keep cooking.

11
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,660
We have to save
 my grandma.

12
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,864
You take flour alone,
it's tasteless,

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,434
and you sure wouldn't want to
eat a stick of butter.

14
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,602
[laughs]

15
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,637
But when you
blend them all together

16
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,306
in just the right way,

17
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:41,675
that's when
the magic happens.

18
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,744
Mm. And...

19
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:47,848
chocolates, Madam?

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,450
[laughs]

21
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,918
Mmm.

22
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:54,021
Wait. Don't we need these
for the cookies?

23
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:58,192
Oh, rule number one
of baking:

24
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,393
extra chocolate.

25
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,328
[laughs]

26
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:03,131
Extra chocolate.
Extra chocolate.

27
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:08,469
**

28
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,485
Hi, Grandma.

29
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:28,656
What'd the doctor say?

30
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,591
Well, all of Grandma's tests
came back normal.

31
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,427
Forget the tests.
She's obviously not okay.

32
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,197
We know, sweetie.
It's... a mystery.

33
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,598
But don't worry.
We won't give up.

34
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,966
We just need to
keep looking for

35
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:39,967
the right doctor
to help her.

36
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,702
Yeah.

37
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,670
Okay?

38
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,185
Extra chocolate.

39
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,887
Extra chocolate.

40
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,189
[laughs]

41
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,392
Do you remember when
we made these cookies?

42
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,196
It was only
four months ago.

43
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,901
I know you're in there,
Grandma.

44
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,237
I promise you...

45
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,871
I'm gonna
figure this out.

46
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,810
**

47
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,379
I can't believe
it's only 10 a.m.

48
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,215
and I already
need a nap.

49
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:30,584
Did you stay up to watch the
little league championship
from Tokyo, too?

50
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:31,952
Mm, no.
I was up all night

51
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,754
looking through
the cookbook.

52
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,323
[sighs] It never ends.

53
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,024
That's how I felt about
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

54
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,326
No, I'm serious.

55
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,928
The book literally
never ends.

56
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,299
I just kept
 flipping through the pages,

57
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,435
and more just
 kept appearing.

58
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,904
Darbie: Whoa.

59
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,973
I mean, whoa.

60
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,243
Did you find out
anything about
Cedronian vanilla?

61
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,610
It doesn't exist.

62
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,446
But I did learn
a lot about cedar closets,

63
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,281
vanilla and
Vietnamese monkeys,

64
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,783
which, FYI, have
the tiniest noses ever.

65
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,519
How many times
have I told you to
stay off wikipedia?

66
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,821
Well, I can't
hang out after school.

67
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,524
Mr. Taneburg
caught three people
texting in class,

68
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,494
and now I have a test on
the American Revolution
tomorrow.

69
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,962
Why are you worried?

70
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,530
You're good in History.

71
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,799
Actually, you're good
in every class.

72
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,568
I know,
but it's not fair.

73
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,002
My phone was on silent

74
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,805
because I actually read
the student handbook.

75
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,007
You always freak out
and you always do fine.

76
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,776
Come over after school
and we'll help you study.

77
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,143
On one condition.

78
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,280
You have to buy me
a granola bar.

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,448
I forgot my money.

80
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,984
Oh, that must be
the new exchange student.

81
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,786
She's from Barcelona.

82
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,455
I heard she doesn't speak
a word of English.

83
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,557
Of course.
That's why she's here.

84
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,559
- To learn.
- [giggling]

85
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,162
Hola.
 Me llamo Darbie.

86
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,364
Habla EspaÃ±ol?

87
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,333
Vale. Me llamo
 Carmela de la Paz.

88
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,934
[speaks Spanish]

89
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,471
Me llamo Darbie.

90
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,542
I wish I knew more than
 me llamo Darbie.

91
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,176
You know what I wish?
That I could learn history

92
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,546
without spending hours
that I don't have studying.

93
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,180
Ooh, can I have
a second wish?

94
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,482
'Cause I wish
I could teleport.

95
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,650
I wish I could
read minds,

96
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,319
and I'd start
with Grandma.

97
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,590
If only we had
a magical cookbook
to help us.

98
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,527
I don't know
about this, guys.

99
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,329
We said that we would
only use the cookbook

100
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,963
if it was
absolutely necessary.

101
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,899
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hi, Mrs. Quinn.

102
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,867
What's up?

103
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,239
[sighs] This is
absolutely necessary.

104
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,342
"Jumping Jack
Flapjacks."

105
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,510
"Slow Caramel Turtles."

106
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,878
How do we know
which spell to use?

107
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:41,048
Maybe if we concentrate,
the book will show us.

108
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,253
- [sighs]
- Well, that was a bust.

109
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,988
Maybe it's broken.

110
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,092
"Brain Boosting Bolognese"

111
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,827
Brain boosting?

112
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,398
Yes!
Now I can definitely
pass my test.

113
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,132
Sorry for
doubting you.

114
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,034
I love Bolognese.

115
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,102
I think.

116
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,270
What is it?

117
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,372
It's an Italian
red sauce,

118
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,039
and it's amazing.

119
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,842
Perfect. You know
I read that we only use
10 percent of our brain.

120
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,678
Imagine if we use
the other 90 percent.

121
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,446
I can't.
I'm only using 10.

122
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,247
[laughing]

123
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,485
Garlic, onions,
tomato paste.

124
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:21,755
We need Livonian sage
and Taurian thyme.

125
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,391
Hm. I've never
heard of those.

126
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,858
Neither has Wikipedia.

127
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,627
But there is a lot
on the thymus,

128
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,396
which is an organ
in your immune system.

129
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,698
- It says here that--
- Focus.

130
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,401
Clearly, these are
magical ingredients.

131
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,136
Which means another trip
to Mama P's.

132
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,505
No way.

133
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,039
I mean, I get it.

134
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,411
She's sweet and kind
and always super nice.

135
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,413
And her cookies are
totally amazing.

136
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,547
But she gives me
the creeps.

137
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,616
Good point.
Nobody is that awesome.

138
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,117
But look at her shop.

139
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,620
She's the only one who has
all the ingredients.

140
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,822
Better point.
We have to go.

141
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,923
No, we don't.

142
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,691
We haven't even checked
the grocery store.

143
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,026
Let me ask you
a question.

144
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,428
What year was
the battle of Bunker Hill?

145
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,862
- I don't know.
- Neither do I,

146
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,131
but it's gonna be
on the test. Let's go.

147
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,433
Oh.

148
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,801
[bell jingles]

149
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,476
Hey, guys.
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

150
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:19,680
Okay, I just came up with
the greatest business idea
of all time.

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,081
- You know how there--
- That's great.

152
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,516
Maybe later.

153
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,717
We need--

154
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,187
[whispering]
We need Livonian sage,

155
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,188
and Taurian thyme.

156
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,322
Why are you whispering?

157
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,724
[whispering]
I'm not whispering.

158
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,526
- Livonian what?
- Shh!

159
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,061
I've never
heard of those.

160
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,029
Are you sure
you got it right?

161
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,631
Yes.

162
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,836
Look here.

163
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,237
L-I-V--

164
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,474
Hey, Mama P,
you ever heard of
Livonian sage?

165
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,751
Well, I've never seen
a cookbook like that before.

166
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,186
It's my grandmother's.

167
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,622
Really?

168
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,557
I bet it has some
great recipes.

169
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,758
It looks like
a very old book.

170
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,894
Well, her grandmother is
a very old lady.

171
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,566
So, you're looking for
Livonian sage, huh?

172
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,801
What are you girls
making this time?

173
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:14,768
Nothing!

174
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,305
You know.

175
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,640
Nothing.

176
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,575
They're also looking for
Taurus something--

177
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,776
Taurian thyme?

178
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,047
I have some in the back.
Wait here.

179
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,883
You guys okay?

180

[sighs]

181
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,385
Yeah, yeah,
we're fine.

182
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,188
So, you were
telling us about
your new business.

183
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,423
Oh, right.

184
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,526
Okay, so you know
about food trucks.

185
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,560
Right?

186
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,995
I'm gonna open up
a food bike.

187
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,034
- Huh?
- You know, like
a food truck.

188
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:47,968
But a bike.

189
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,402
You know,
just for a few years

190
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,838
until I'm old enough
to get my license.

191
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,072
That's a great idea, Jake.

192
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,173
Mama P: Here you go.

193
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,815
That'll be $10,
please.

194
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,717
Sorry, guys.
I forgot my money.

195
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,619
You always forget
your money.

196
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,887
Uh, can I please
get a receipt.

197
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,056
I like to
keep track of my spending.

198
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,626
Remember,
time is precious.

199
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,762
Use it wisely.

200
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:17,164
We will.
Thanks.

201
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,036
Do you think she was
talking about time or...

202
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,037
thyme?

203
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,172
Does it matter?

204
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,608
Either way,
it's creepy.

205
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,309

207
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,158
The moment of truth.

208
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:49,162
Add one-fourth teaspoon
of Livonian sage.

209
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,599
I don't get how this will
boost our brains.

210
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,601
Pasta usually just
makes me sleepy.

211
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,703
Sage is another word
for smart person.

212
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,738
Add another pinch.
We need to be sage-er.

213
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,775
And now for
Taurian thyme.

214
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,444
But it doesn't say
how much.

215
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:08,315
Maybe thyme
equals actual time.

216
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,417
But who's gonna
pay the price?

217
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,619
I don't think anyone.

218
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,788
Each spice has
its own rule.

219
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,189
Look, there's a rhyme.

220
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,291
[reading]

Let's play it safe.

223
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,903
Who knows how powerful
this stuff is.

224
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,274
Well,
let's boost our brains.

[bubbling]

226
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,188
Well, I'm not feeling
any boost yet.

227
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,757
Maybe it takes time
to work.

228
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,358
Well, I hope it
kicks in soon,

229
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,362
'cause this telenovela
makes no sense.

230
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,699
What are you doing?

231
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,167
While we wait,

232
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,870
we'll write down things
we know about magic.

233
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,256
So we know nothing.

234
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,418
Clearly,
this isn't working.

235
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,754
Unless you meant to
draw a chicken,

236
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,122
then it's really good.

237
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,525
It's not a chicken.
It's a hawk.

238
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,093
I better get going.

239
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,495
Looks like I have
a long night of studying
ahead of me.

240
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,964
Bye.

241
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,633
Hasta maÃ±ana, Kell.

242
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,968
That's all I got.

00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:38,899
I can't believe
how much we missed.

248
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,233
The book is filled
with clues.

249
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,572
I counted up how many times
Cedronian vanilla was used
in the book,

250
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,474
and so far I've come to
36 mentions,

251
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,676
which, if you take
the square root of that,
is six.

252
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,144
Wow, what does that mean?

253
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,313
I don't know yet,
but it is definitely
something.

254
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,516
Hey, guys.
So, who wants to
test me on history?

255
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,985
I'm guessing
the spell worked
for you, too.

256
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,887
I'm an expert on
the American Revolution.

257
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,156
And I'm not talking
the white-washed drivel
in our textbooks.

258
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,525
Do you know what
it was all about?

259
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,827
Freedom?

260
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,796
Ha! That's what they
want you to believe.

261
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,463
But it was actually
about power.

262
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,833
One man was responsible
for it all.

263
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,134
The Earl of Butte.

264
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,136
He formed a secret cabinet
in England,

265
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,171
and was the real
puppet master.

266
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,007
Wow. You got this all
last night?

267
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,010
How long does it take?
Connect the dots.

268
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,044
Hola, Carmela.

Wow. That's a lot more
than me llamo Darbie.

271
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:35,923
I'm fluent.

272
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,724
You sounded
so sophisticated.

273
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,926
What did you say?

274
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,627
I told her it was
pork chop day.

275
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,962
We're having lunch together.

276
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,530
This is the
best spell ever.

277
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,640
Hi, there.
I'm Ida Perez.

278
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,142
I own Mama P's
down the block.

279
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,410
Right.
The competition.

280
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,445
Oh, nonsense.

281
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,981
There's plenty of coffee
to go around.

282
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,216
I just wanted to
welcome you to
the neighborhood.

283
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,485
I hope you will be here
for a long, long time.

284
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,354
Thanks. Me, too.

285
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,622
For some reason
there's been a lot of
turnover in this spot.

286
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,258
Oh, well, don't worry
about that.

287
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,125
[laughs]

288
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,927
I have a good feeling
about you.

289
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,967
Ida.

290
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,871
I saw the book.

291
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,906
Becky's granddaughter
has it.

292
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,240
Leave that girl alone.

293
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,877
Don't tell me what to do.

294
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,744
I'm going to
get that book back.

295
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,147
These are
terrific cookies.

296
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,949
I'm so glad
you like them.

297
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,120
Enjoy your tea.

298
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,290
This place will be closed
before you know it.

301
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,482
Thanks for coming down here
on such short notice.

302
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,719
I thought this was something
you should really see.

303
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,322
What did Buddy do now?

304
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,724
- This.
- Is that the White House?

305
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,359
Made of popsicle sticks.

306
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,494
Have you ever
thought about putting Buddy
in the gifted class?

307
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,342
Teacher: The answer
to number three.

Kelly?

309
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,845
Kelly.

310
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,948
- Kelly!
- Huh?

311
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,049
I mean, yes?

312
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,383
[laughter]

313
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,453
The answer,
if 3x and 4y
equal--

314
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,089
Great idea.
I should apply algebra.

315
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,623
Finally a use for it.

316
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,059
[laughter]

317
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,493
Kelly,
this isn't like you.

318
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,461
Pay attention, please.

319
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,564
Of course.
Sorry, just tired.

320
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,300
Adam, number three.

321
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,105
Yes, Hannah.

322
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,373
Can I have
more paper, please?

323
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,740
If you need more space
for your answer,

324
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,775
just use the back.

325
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,477
I already have.

326
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,251
Better make it two.

327
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,086
Or four.

328
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,620
"The Great Gatsby."

329
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,155
"El Gran Gatsby."

330
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,856
Is a cautionary tale--

00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,792
[speaking Spanish]

332
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,496

of the American dream.

335
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,802
I think it's very sweet
that you're translating.

336
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,371
But, number one,
Carmela's here to
learn English.

337
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,441
And, number two,
it's disrupting the class.

338
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,809
Oh, okay.

339
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,677
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,626
Kelly. This is not
a private school.

You can't just
write on the walls.

343
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,030
Clean up this mess.

344
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,331
You've got detention.

345
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,171
This is a deeply
layered question

346
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,340
that you expect me to answer
in the allotted time

347
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,375
is the reason
this country's
educational system

348
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,943
is failing our youth.

349
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,179
I've heard enough.
Detention.

351
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,616
- [giggling]
- Darbie.

352
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,186
For the last time,
you have to stop
speaking Spanish

353
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,554
in my English class.

354
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,688
But it's so cool.

355
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,090
I've never known
a secret language

356
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,358
that no one
understands.

357
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,060
Then speak it after class.

[speaking Spanish]

359
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,167
I'm not lonely.

360
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,303
I only have three cats.

361
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,339
And, by the way,
I speak Spanish.

362
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,209
You have detenciÃ³n.

363
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,278
So, this is
detention, huh?

364
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,945
Well, I guess there's a
first time for everything.

365
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:53,980
I've never noticed

366
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,715
how inferior
our library is.

367
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,152
This is like mi casa
away from casa.

368
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,187
What are those?

369
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,654
Detention snacks.

370
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,857
The secret to survival
is fuel and hydration.

371
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,359
Chewy fruit?

372
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,196
Doesn't snacking
normally get you
sent to detention?

373
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,197
It's a vicious cycle.

374
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,431
I don't get it.

375
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,233
My brain is going
a million miles an hour,

376
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,336
but I still haven't had
a breakthrough.

377
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,439
What are you doing?

378
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,908
[groans] I'm getting
out of here.

379
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,510
Notice the air vent?

380
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,613
As we all know,
buildings constructed
after 1960

381
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:30,350
must have air ducts
connecting to exterior
ventilation.

382
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,452
We take the duct
leading to the gym,

383
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,255
then we drop down in
the girls locker room.

384
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,723
Are you nuts?

385
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,191
Trust me,
it's simple.

386
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,127
Using secret tunnels
as a mode of escape

387
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,628
goes back to
the days of--

388
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:48,801
Uh--
What was I saying?

389
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,005
Oh, no. The spell
just wore off.

390
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,407
Mine did, too.

391
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,376
Looks like a crazy person
wrote this.

392
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,145
Carmela texted me.

393
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,781
[speaking Spanish]

394
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,418
Yeah, I have no idea
what that means.

395
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,386
"Xoxo."

396
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,389
What a waste of a spell.

397
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,059
All boosting our brains did
was get us in trouble.

398
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,361
I let Grandma down.

399
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,762
Don't say that.

400
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,798
Look, we're gonna
figure this out. Okay?

401
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,634
Thanks.

402
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,836
Come on. Let's put
these boxes back.

403
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,310
Great. Now we have
more stuff to clean up.

404
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,182
Cool.
Old year books.

405
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:38,785
Hey, look.
1964.

406
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,453
My grandma was here then.

407
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,196
Is that your grandma?

408
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,897
I don't believe it.

409
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,332
It's from 7th grade.

410
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,267
Look, there's a caption
under the photo.

411
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,068
"The Three Musketeers."

412
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,907
Rebecca Patterson,
Gina Silvers...

413
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,842
and Ida Perez.

414
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,314
That must be Mama P.

415
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,316
They were friends?

416
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,351
I had no idea.

417
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,320
Grandma never
mentioned her.

418
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,121
She barely even said
hello to Mama P

419
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,223
when we passed her
in town.

420
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,858
Um, guys.

421
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,694
Look what's
sticking out of
Mama P's bag.

422
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,431
The cookbook.

423
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:27,367
But she acted like she's
never even seen it before.

424
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,340
[camera shutter clicking]

425
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,342
Why would Mama P lie?

426
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,518
I'm confused.

427
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,321
How did you come up with
this math equation?

428
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,357
And what does
the W stand for?

429
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,392
Whipped cream?

430
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,160
This whole thing
makes no sense.

431
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,028
That spell was
really strong.

432
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,364
Tell me about it.

433
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,699
I just got an invitation
to speak at Oxford.

434
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,435
They liked
my dissertation

435
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,737
on the myths of the
American Revolution.

436
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,805
You wrote that?

437
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:06,706
Apparently.

438
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,541
It turns out
the magic worked,

439
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,244
just not in the way
we thought it would.

440
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:14,146
It led us to
the library.

441
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,214
I also found
a clue.

442
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,416
When I re-read my notes,

443
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,919
I found one thing
that made sense.

444
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,390
"Oigan twigen meiotic"?

445
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,491
That made sense?

446
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,058
It means
"blend two pints of milk."

447
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,827
In what language?

448
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,796
It's not Spanish.

449
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,564
- Is it?
- It's old English.

450
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,199
It's a recipe for posset,

451
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,468
which is a hot drink
using spices,

452
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,437
and curdled goats milk.

453
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,005
Oh, that sounds
disgusting.

454
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,408
Well, it was very popular.

455
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,978
In the Middle Ages.

456
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,815
Wait a minute.

457
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,117
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

458
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,353
Yes.

459
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:56,556
This cookbook is at least
500 years old.

460
00:20:56,556 --> 00:21:00,760
So your grandma
didn't create the book.

461
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,329
[sighs] No.

462
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,397
It's way bigger than her.

463
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,335
We're not gonna
figure this out tonight.

464
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,570
Like Grandma always says,

465
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,339
there are no shortcuts.

466
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,210
Speaking of, I have
a chemistry test tomorrow.

467
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,779
I was so focused
on history

468
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,748
that I ignored
my other subjects

469
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,083
I'm good at chemistry.
We can help you study.

470
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,085
Yeah, I have
the perfect recipe

471
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,220
to insure you ace it.

472
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,489
No!

473
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,123
Kelly,
no more spells.

474
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,359
Banana bread.

475
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,961
Relax.
My mom bought this
at the market.

476
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,631
[giggling]

477
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,700
I told you
Buddy had a gift.

478
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,502
We just needed to be
patient to find it.

479
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,804
Wait 'til that
Doreen Nagle
hears about this.

480
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,207
Bet it wipes that smug look
right off her face.

481
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,709
Not that that matters.

482
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,877
[laughs]

483
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:54,581
[growling] I am
the underwear monster.

484
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:00,387
And I am crushing
the Eiffel Tower!

485
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,254
[roaring]

486
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,289
Oh!

487
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,391
Uh--

488
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,658
[roaring]

489
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,196
[roaring]

490
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,432
Hmm.

491
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,000
[roaring]

492
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,002
Maybe we should put a pin
in this gifted thing.

493
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,639
Good idea.

494
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,774
[dog barking]

495
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:36,723
[sighs]

496
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,630
[bell jingles]

497
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,098
I'm just getting
a coffee, Mom.

498
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,700
Okay. Come on in.

499
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,936
I'll be really quick.

500
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,572
Hi, Scott.

501
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,306
How are you, Becky?

502
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,576
We're on our way
to the doctor for
more tests.

503
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,244
How's she doing?

504
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,079
No change,
unfortunately.

505
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,449
Well, don't worry.

506
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,616
I'm sending
good thoughts.

507
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,984
That's very sweet,
Mama P.

508
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,786
Go get your coffee,
I'll watch her.

509
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,888
Oh, thanks.
I'll be right back.

510
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,303
I see you didn't
get rid of the book.

511
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:28,140
One way or another,
I'm going to get it back.

512
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,481
