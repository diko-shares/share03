And you're trapped

until there's a blue moon...
Very good.

654
00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:42.784
And you like to use
the extremely

655
00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:45.047
for just about everything.
Smurfxactly.

656
00:30:47.379 --> 00:30:50.121
And you're all named
after your personalities?

657
00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:52.091
Do you get your names
when you're born,

658
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.754
or after you've exhibited
certain traits?

659

Yep.

660
00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:56.326

00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:04.167

664
00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:05.999

667
00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:17.409

doesn't appear to be blue."

671
00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.456

(GASPS) Not blue?

No cause for alarm,
my little Smurfs.

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:31.361
If we're to open
the portal home,

675
00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.299
I'll just have to
smurf us a potion

676
00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:34.769
to invoke the blue moon.

677
00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.169
You hear that, honey?

678
00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:38.673
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

679
00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:42.309
Which could happen if
the little blue Santa man
makes a magic potion,

680
00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:45.109
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

681
00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.843
Want a bite?
No, thank you.

682
00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:50.647
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

683
00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:55.124
And when that might be
is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

684
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.127
Mmm. Master Winslow,
might I borrow
your stargazer?

685
00:31:58.183 --> 00:31:59.287
My what-whatzer?

686
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:02.188
Uh-oh. He doesn't have
a stargazer. Do you?

687
00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:03.698
This is all my fault.

688
00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:05.062
We're all gonna die.

689
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.966
We're all gonna die!
Smurf out of it,
scaredy-brains!

690
00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.505
One Panicky Smurf is enough!
Hey!

691
00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:13.672
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything
turns out smurfy.

692
00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.173
Right, Papa?

693
00:32:17.636 --> 00:32:21.516
(STAMMERS) Yes, yes.
It all turns out just fine.

694
00:32:25.744 --> 00:32:29.920
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

695
00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:32.017
If I were a Smurf,
where would I go?

696
00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:33.990
You there, you there.
Fancy pants.

697
00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.531
Have you seen any
little blue men?

698
00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:36.895
Absolutely. What price
are we talking about?

699
00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:38.092
You're selling them?

700
00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:40.328
Have you looked
in the drawer, sweetie?
Wait, what drawer?

701
00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:42.895
In the kitchen, Lilly.
Who is this Lilly?

702
00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:45.406
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl
in my department.

703
00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:47.704
Please, please.
Please, young woodsman.

704
00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:52.215
What does the temperature
of this Lilly have to do
with the finding of Smurfs?

705
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.876
Take your meds, man.
What?

706
00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:58.881
Is everyone in this realm
completely insane?

707
00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:03.883
Thank the gods,
a local wizard.
Excellent.

708
00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:06.126
Pardon me, wise sir?

709
00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:08.458
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

710
00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.761
They're everywhere!
(LAUGHS)

711
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.934
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you
we were close, AzraeI.

712
00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.598
I know.

713
00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:19.135
Now, just take one, everybody.

714
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.642
We have to make sure
our smurfberries last.

715
00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.077
Great. We're gonna
be here how long?

716
00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:26.638
Not long. First,
we have to get a stargazer.

717
00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:29.980
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

718
00:33:30.075 --> 00:33:33.488
and we're home.
Very simple,
my little Smurfs.

719
00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:35.216
Bye, Elway.

720
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.590
Someone looks smurfalish!

721
00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:39.822
Why you wearing a leash?
It's a tie.

722
00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:42.159
Does it keep your neck warm?
No.

723
00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:45.960
Clearly, it functions
as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.

724
00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:48.264
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

725
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.462
What are you,
you pasty giant?

726
00:33:50.562 --> 00:33:54.738
I try to get people
to buy things by analyzing
market trend predictions.

727
00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:58.576
Predictions! A-ha!
He's a fortune teller.

728
00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:01.174
Look, I would love
to explain but I am
super late. I gotta go.

729
00:34:01.272 --> 00:34:03.343
I really don't have
time for this.
(GASPS) What?

730
00:34:03.742 --> 00:34:05.153
You had one outfit on,

731
00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:08.247
and now
you're wearing something
completely different.

732
00:34:08.313 --> 00:34:09.621
Yeah. It...
Now, Smurfette,

733
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:11.820
she probably got
the other one dirty.

734
00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.759
Let's not embarrass her.
Sorry.

735
00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:16.196
Thanks for letting us stay
in your mushroom, Miss Grace.

736
00:34:16.287 --> 00:34:17.527
It's really nice.

737
00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:20.193
Aw! Well, thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

738
00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:22.703
I like our little
mushroom, too.

739
00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:25.001
(WHISPERS)
But you know, somebody
wants a bigger mushroom.

740
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.936
But, then you'd be
further apart.

741
00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:31.205
You said it, sister.
Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

742
00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:32.975
I've got a baby
on the way, so...

743
00:34:33.038 --> 00:34:36.383
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone,
without an adult.

744
00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:39.717
(LAUGHS) I'm 546 years old.

745
00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:41.313
Of course you are.

746
00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:42.982
They'll be fine.
They'll be fine.
All right.

747
00:34:43.048 --> 00:34:45.221
Love you.
Okay.

748
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.193
Bye. Bye.
SMURFETTE:
Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

749
00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:49.629
By the way, I wouldn't go
anywhere if I were you.

750
00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:51.026
Why not?

751
00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:55.561
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other
places.

752
00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.367
I mean, look what
happened to E.T.

753
00:34:58.363 --> 00:35:00.866
It's a movie.
A moving picture.

754
00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:03.371
Book. Just stay, okay?

755
00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:07.647
Great. He's gone
and we still don't
have a stargazer.

756
00:35:07.706 --> 00:35:11.882
Wait a smurf.
If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

757
00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:15.253
Ergo, it's at his
place of business.

758
00:35:15.547 --> 00:35:17.083
Excellent work, Brainy.

759
00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:19.162
What are we waiting for?
Let's ride.

760
00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:21.060
CLUMSY: Yeah, come on, guys.
Hey, stop it.

761
00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:23.223
Come on, Smurfs!
Let's go get that stargazer.

762
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.356
Whoo-hoo!

763
00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:27.395
GUTSY: Surprise, surprise.
GROUCHY: Oh, no.

764
00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:31.167
Clumsy, I think
it might be best

765
00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:33.334
if you stay here.
You know?

766
00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:35.271
Smurf an eye
on the mushroom.

767
00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.401
Oh.

768
00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.403
(WHISTLING)

769
00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.708
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

770
00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.346
This way, Smurfs!
Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

771
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.016
Well, I can smurf an eye
on the mushroom.

772
00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.285
Smurf away!

773
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.054
Whoo! Let's smurf this joint.
BRAINY: Is he down there?

774
00:35:52.117 --> 00:35:53.357
Taxi!
Can you see him?

775
00:35:53.418 --> 00:35:55.864
GUTSY: Look, he's getting
into the mechanical wagon.

776
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.422
Oh, no.
Clearly that distance
is too great...

777
00:35:57.522 --> 00:36:00.196
Off you go!
No! Gutsy!

778
00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:02.204
Come on, Smurfs!
Smurfabunga!

779
00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:04.068
Goodbye, blue world.

780
00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:05.870
Use your hat, you ninny!

781
00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:09.044
GROUCHY: Couldn't we just
have taken the stairs?

782
00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:11.307
There we go.
Not funny, Gutsy.

783
00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:12.472
Oh!

784
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.607
It was a little funny.
PAPA: Shh! Smurfs.

785
00:36:15.707 --> 00:36:17.744
PAPA: We're stopping.
Hold on tight.

786
00:36:17.809 --> 00:36:19.152
SMURFETTE: Not to me, Grouchy.

787
00:36:19.244 --> 00:36:21.747
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.

788
00:36:21.813 --> 00:36:23.918
Keep the change.
Thanks, man.

789
00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.627
Master Winslow,
we really need your help.

790
00:36:26.718 --> 00:36:27.822
Yoo-hoo! Hey.
Right here.

791
00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.091
What are you doing here?

792
00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:32.966
What part of "we need
a stargazer" don't you
understand, you numptie?

793
00:36:33.158 --> 00:36:35.399
You can't be out in public.

794
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.734
Who are you talking to?

795
00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:40.240
If we could just have
a quick look around
in your predicting parlor...

796
00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:42.335
We really wanna go home.
DRIVER: Come on, man,
I gotta go.

797
00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:44.606
Fine. Just come here,
come here.
SMURFETTE: Please, please.

798
00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.312
All of you. Trust me.

799
00:36:46.638 --> 00:36:48.117
GUTSY: Careful. Hey,
watch the smurfberries.

800
00:36:48.173 --> 00:36:50.619
I'm not going... Hey!

801
00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.814
Be quiet.
BRAINY: It's dark in here.

802
00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:54.254
GROUCHY: All right,
who smurfed?

803
00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:57.122
GUTSY: Hey! Get your hand
out of my kilt.

804
00:36:57.182 --> 00:36:58.684
BRAINY: Um,
that's not my hand.

805
00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:00.023
PATRICK: Hey, ticklish.

806
00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:05.098
Morning. Morning.
RECEPTIONIST: Good morning,
Mr. Winslow.

807
00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:07.158
Congratulations on
your promotion.
Thank you.

808
00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:09.329
I hope you guys
like desk drawers,
because that's where...

809
00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.634
You're late.
Odile!

810
00:37:11.763 --> 00:37:13.538
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
You were in my office.

811
00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:16.641
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.

812
00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:19.875
The launch for Jouvenel
is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?

813
00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:22.815
Close. I had
a crazy morning.
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

814
00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:25.017
What are you doing?

815
00:37:25.143 --> 00:37:29.387
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about
all the concept ideas.

816
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.293
And hungry. Sorry.
Hungry for its success.

817
00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:35.890
Nervous energy.

818
00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:38.024
Nervous energy's what's
going on up in here.

819
00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.328
I like it.
Yep.

820
00:37:39.524 --> 00:37:42.130
The fear of failure is
a fabulous motivator.

821
00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.331
True that.

822
00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:45.664
SMURFETTE: Hey! Stop it.

823
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.506
Henri.
Make it work.

824
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.507
You have no idea.

825
00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.872
SMURFETTE: What is this?
GUTSY: Why did I
get the armpit?

826
00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:56.542
Stop pushing me.
GROUCHY: Go easy on
the cologne tomorrow.

827
00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.518
Are you crazy?

828
00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:00.487
You're gonna get me fired.
My hair!

829
00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:01.751
GUTSY: I couldn't even
breathe in there.

830
00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.826
It smelled like the business
end of a sheep.

831

I don't see a stargazer.
How you doing?

Master Winslow, but we badly
need to borrow your stargazer.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.029
I don't have
a stargazer, okay?

834
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:17.665
It's not something people
of this century just have,
especially here.

835
00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:18.901
Not happy.

836
00:38:18.997 --> 00:38:21.705
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to work.

837
00:38:22.267 --> 00:38:25.271
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.

838
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.681

we'll get the stargazer.
