00:45:08.564 --> 00:45:13.060
You are the only one in the village who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

653
00:45:13.235 --> 00:45:15.940
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

654
00:45:16.238 --> 00:45:21.066
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:

655
00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:23.825
Can the living marry the dead?

656
00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:26.867
What on earth are you speaking about?

657
00:45:27.041 --> 00:45:29.995
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

658
00:45:30.419 --> 00:45:32.661
He has a corpse bride!

659
00:45:32.838 --> 00:45:36.539
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

660
00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:38.712
Hmm.

661
00:45:38.928 --> 00:45:41.928
I believe I know the thing to do.

662
00:45:42.598 --> 00:45:43.926
Come with me.

663
00:45:46.769 --> 00:45:49.260
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

664
00:45:49.438 --> 00:45:53.103
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

665
00:45:53.275 --> 00:45:55.564
Her mind has come undone, I fear.

666
00:45:55.736 --> 00:45:57.859
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

667
00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:02.739
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

668
00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:04.697
Take her to her room!

669
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.278
No, I'm telling the truth.

670
00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:09.330
Victor needs my help.

671
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.742
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

672
00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:14.836
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

673
00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:19.466
...and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.

Oh, let me go! Let me go!

It will be years before we can show
ourselves in public again.

678
00:46:33.232 --> 00:46:36.850
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

679
00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:39.316
- Victor.
- Whatever.

680
00:46:39.488 --> 00:46:44.197
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman like Victoria...

681
00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:46.407
...it's positively criminal.

682
00:46:46.578 --> 00:46:50.790
Why, if I had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

683
00:46:50.958 --> 00:46:55.536
...I would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

684
00:46:55.713 --> 00:46:59.378
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

685
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.420
Alas, I am not married.

686
00:47:02.594 --> 00:47:04.468
I was betrothed some years ago...

687
00:47:04.638 --> 00:47:08.553
...but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

688
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:12.807
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

689
00:47:14.148 --> 00:47:15.808
Oh.

690
00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:24.819
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

691
00:47:24.992 --> 00:47:26.272
You found him?

692
00:47:26.452 --> 00:47:29.903
Make haste, my dear,
our relatives will arrive at any moment.

693
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.532

for Lord Barkis.

696
00:47:37.004 --> 00:47:38.546
He will make a fine husband.

697
00:47:38.714 --> 00:47:42.047
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events
indeed.

698
00:47:42.217 --> 00:47:44.459
A far better prospect this time.

699
00:47:44.636 --> 00:47:48.337
But I do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

700
00:47:48.515 --> 00:47:51.386
- We must.
- Please, I beg of you.

701
00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.971
There must be another way.

702
00:47:53.145 --> 00:47:55.054
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

703
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:57.721
...we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

Oh, how touching.

988
01:07:49.924 --> 01:07:52.711
I always cry at weddings.

989
01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:58.341
Our young lovers together at last.

990
01:07:58.516 --> 01:08:02.466
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

991
01:08:03.521 --> 01:08:05.145
But you forget...

992
01:08:05.356 --> 01:08:07.432
...she's still my wife!

993
01:08:07.608 --> 01:08:10.278
I'll not leave here empty-handed!

994
01:08:11.612 --> 01:08:12.775
You?

995
01:08:15.783 --> 01:08:17.194
Emily?

996
01:08:17.368 --> 01:08:18.566
You!

997
01:08:18.744 --> 01:08:21.745
But... But... I left you.

998
01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:23.911
<font color="#839fcf">[WHISPERS]</font>
For dead.

1002
01:08:34.969 --> 01:08:38.254
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

1003
01:08:38.431 --> 01:08:40.803
Take your hands off her.

1004
01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:44.596
Do I have to kill you too?

1008
01:08:51.652 --> 01:08:53.146
Sorry.

Get out.

Oh, I'm leaving.

Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

1021
01:10:11.899 --> 01:10:13.559
Tell me, my dear...

1022
01:10:13.734 --> 01:10:18.610
...can a heart still break
once it's stopped beating? Hm?

Let me at him! Let me at him!

1025
01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:24.029
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

1026
01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:27.909
We must abide by their rules.

We are amongst the living.

1028

Well said.

Oh, Victor,
I never thought I'd see you again.

Wait.

1039
01:11:31.312 --> 01:11:33.554
I made a promise.

1040
01:11:36.275 --> 01:11:38.848
You kept your promise.

1041
01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.652
You set me free.

1042
