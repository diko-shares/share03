1
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.940
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.700
Here ye, here ye, 10 minutes to go
till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.

3
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.380
Watch it!

4
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.640
<i>- It's a beautiful day
- It's a rather nice day</i>

5
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.970
<i>A day for a glorious wedding</i>

6
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.900
<i>A rehearsal, my dear
To be perfectly clear</i>

7
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.490
<i>A rehearsal for a glorious wedding</i>

8
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.570
<i>Assuming nothing happens
That we don't really know</i>

9
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.160
<i>That nothing unexpected
Interferes with the show</i>

10
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.830
<i>And that's why everything
Every last little thing</i>

11
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.580
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go</i>

12
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.790
<i>- According to plan
- Our son will be married</i>

13
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.091
<i>- According to plan
- Our family carried</i>

14
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:01.181
<i>Elevated to the heights of society</i>

15
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.851
<i>- To the costume balls
- In the hallowed halls</i>

16
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.181
<i>Rubbing elbows with the finest</i>

17
00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:08.811
<i>Having crumpets with Her Highness</i>

18
00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:11.941
<i>We'll be there, we'll be seen
Having tea with the queen</i>

19
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:16.491
<i>We'll forget everything
That we've ever, ever been</i>

20
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:21.111
- Blimey! It's my dress is caught.
- Begging your pardon, ma'am.

21
00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:24.621
- Come on, dear.
- It's not me. It's my dress is caught.

22
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:27.621
Where is Victor? We might be late.

23
00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:34.501
Fish merchants.

24
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.801
<i>- It's a terrible day
- Now, don't be that way</i>

25
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.511
<i>It's a terrible day for a wedding</i>

26
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:43.681
<i>It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in</i>

27
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:47.061
<i>That has led to this ominous wedding</i>

28
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:49.721
<i>How could our family have come to this?</i>

29
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:52.561
<i>To marry off our daughter
To the nouveau riche</i>

30
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:54.231
<i>- They're so common
- So coarse</i>

31
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:58.191
<i>- Oh, it couldn't be worse
- Couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree</i>

32
00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:01.231
<i>They could be land-rich,
Bankrupt aristocracy</i>

33
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:02.611
<i>Without a penny to their name</i>

34
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:06.161
<i>Just like you and me</i>

35
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.951
Oh, dear.

36
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.581
<i>And that's why everything
Every last little thing</i>

37
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:16.731
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go</i>

38
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:21.761
<i>- According to plan
- Our daughter will wed</i>

39
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.841
<i>- According to plan
- Our family led</i>

40
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:29.841
<i>From the depths of deepest poverty</i>

41
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:33.731
<i>- To the noble realm
- Of our ancestry</i>

42
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.731
<i>And who would have guessed
In a million years</i>

43
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:40.111
<i>- That our daughter with a face
- Of an otter in disgrace</i>

44
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:44.951
<i>Would provide our ticket
To a rightful place</i>

45
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:52.541
Oh, Hildegarde.

46
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:56.331
What if Victor and I
don't like each other?

47
00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:59.961
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.

48
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.761
Do you suppose your father and I
like each other?

49
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:06.171
Surely you must a little?

50
00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:07.552
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

51
00:05:07.722 --> 00:05:09.852
Get those corsets laced properly.

52
00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:12.722
I can hear you speak without gasping.

53
00:05:19.062 --> 00:05:21.572
You've certainly hooked a winner
this time, Victor.

54
00:05:21.572 --> 00:05:25.492
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.
- I'm already reeling, Mother.

55
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.782
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot
be marrying a lord or something?

56
00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:32.292
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the Everglots.

57
00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:36.832
I always knew I deserved better
than a fish merchant's life.

58
00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:39.292
But I've never even spoken to her.

59
00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:42.422
Well, at least we have that
in our favor.

60
00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:46.592
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.

61
00:05:51.512 --> 00:05:55.602
Marriage is a partnership,
a little tit for tat.

62
00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:58.192
You'd think a lifetime watching us...

63
00:05:58.192 --> 00:06:01.062
<i>Might have taught her that</i>

64
00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:04.342
<i>- Might have taught her that
- Everything must be perfect</i>

65
00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:07.362
<i>- Everything must be perfect
- Everything must be perfect</i>

66
00:06:07.362 --> 00:06:09.202
<i>Perfect
That's why everything</i>

67
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.782
<i>Every last little thing</i>

68
00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:15.122
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go</i>

69
00:06:15.122 --> 00:06:19.582
<i>According to plan</i>

70
00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:22.962
Look at the way you're standing.

71
00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:25.992
You look like you got rickets
or something...

72
00:06:33.722 --> 00:06:39.642
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccable taste!

73
00:06:39.642 --> 00:06:41.652
Oh, beautiful, innit?

74
00:06:43.652 --> 00:06:45.772
It's not as big as our place, dear.

75
00:06:48.782 --> 00:06:51.322
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?
- Shut up.

76
00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:54.242
Lord and Lady Everglot...

77
00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:58.082
...Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort.

78
00:06:58.082 --> 00:07:00.982
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

79
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:05.502
Yes, I must say, you don't look a day
over 20. No. Oh, yes.

80
00:07:06.502 --> 00:07:09.662
Smile, darling, smile.

81
00:07:13.852 --> 00:07:18.693
Well, hello. What a pleasure.
Welcome to our home.

82
00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:20.353
Thank you.

83
00:07:20.353 --> 00:07:23.993
We'll be taking tea
in the west drawing room.

84
00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.863
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.

85
00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:32.283
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
Who is your decorator?

86
00:07:32.283 --> 00:07:34.493
Nice tiles, shame about the drapes.

87
00:07:34.493 --> 00:07:38.393
My husband says such foolish things.
Ignore him.

88
00:07:38.493 --> 00:07:40.883
Yes, it's usually best.

89
00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:12.763
- Do forgive me.
- You play beautifully.

90
00:09:12.763 --> 00:09:18.513
I... I... I do apologize, Miss Everglot.
How rude of me to... Well...

91
00:09:18.763 --> 00:09:20.563
Excuse me.

92
00:09:22.183 --> 00:09:24.474
Mother won't let me near the piano.

93
00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:28.154
Music is improper for a young lady.

94
00:09:28.154 --> 00:09:29.864
Too passionate, she says.

95
00:09:29.864 --> 00:09:34.824
If I may ask, Miss Everglot...

96
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.354
...where is your chaperon?

97
00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:42.494
Perhaps, in...
In view of the circumstances...

98
00:09:42.584 --> 00:09:45.634
...you could call me Victoria.

99
00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:47.804
Yes, of course. Well...

100
00:09:48.294 --> 00:09:51.914
- Victoria...
- Yes, Victor.

101
00:09:52.964 --> 00:09:55.634
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

102
00:09:57.224 --> 00:09:58.554
M... M...

103
00:09:59.014 --> 00:10:03.744
- Married.
- Yes. Married.

104
00:10:04.564 --> 00:10:09.144
Since I was a child, I've...
I've dreamt of my wedding day.

105
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.594
I always hoped to find someone
I was deeply in love with.

106
00:10:12.694 --> 00:10:15.934
Someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

107
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.994
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yes, silly.

108
00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:22.774
No. No, not at all, no.

109
00:10:22.994 --> 00:10:25.544
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

110
00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.304
What impropriety is this?

111
00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:36.464
You shouldn't be alone together.

112
00:10:36.464 --> 00:10:41.184
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsal.

113
00:10:41.184 --> 00:10:45.944
Pastor Galswells is waiting.
Come at once.

114
00:10:48.354 --> 00:10:51.404
<i>Master Van Dort,
from the beginning. Again.</i>

115
00:10:51.404 --> 00:10:56.994
"With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

116
00:10:57.034 --> 00:11:03.074
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

117
00:11:03.074 --> 00:11:09.254
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

118
00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:14.734
With this ring, I ask you to be mine."

119
00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:19.094
- Let's try it again.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

120
00:11:19.094 --> 00:11:21.514
With this candle...

121
00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.764
This candle...

122
00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:28.854
This candle.

123
00:11:29.684 --> 00:11:33.655
- Shall I get up there and do it for him?
- Don't get all aflutter, dear.

124
00:11:39.445 --> 00:11:41.615
With this candle...

125
00:11:43.455 --> 00:11:44.705
Continue!

126
00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:48.955
Get the door, Emil.

127
00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:53.965
Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.

128
00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.295
A Lord Barkis, sir.

129
00:12:01.635 --> 00:12:04.185
I haven't a head for dates.

130
00:12:04.185 --> 00:12:07.395
Apparently,
I'm a day early for the ceremony.

131
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:12.645
- Is he from your side of the family?
- I can't recall.

132
00:12:12.645 --> 00:12:15.315
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

133
00:12:20.745 --> 00:12:23.155
Do carry on.

134
00:12:23.155 --> 00:12:28.205
Let's try it again, shall we,
Master Van Dort?

135
00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:32.585
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Right.

136
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.675
Right. Oh, right!

137
00:12:35.675 --> 00:12:40.005
- With this... This...
- Hand.

138
00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:43.055
With this hand...

139
00:12:43.055 --> 00:12:44.725
...I... With...

140
00:12:44.725 --> 00:12:47.185
Three steps, three!

141
00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:51.815
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?

142
00:12:51.815 --> 00:12:53.685
- No! No.
- You do not?

143
00:12:53.685 --> 00:12:57.865
No! I meant, no,
I do not not wish to be married.

144
00:12:57.865 --> 00:13:00.405
That is, I want very much to...

145
00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:04.865
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?

146
00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:07.495
The ring? Yes. Of course.

147
00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:13.455
- Dropping the ring.
- Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

148
00:13:13.455 --> 00:13:17.515
- This boy doesn't want to get married.
- How disgraceful!

149
00:13:17.585 --> 00:13:19.555
Excuse me. Got it!

150
00:13:22.925 --> 00:13:25.475
Out of the way, you ninny.

151
00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:30.975
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a
woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

152
00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:36.935
- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.
- Stop fanning it, you fool.

153
00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:44.906
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.
- I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

154
00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:58.986
Enough! This wedding cannot take place
until he is properly prepared.

155
00:14:00.216 --> 00:14:06.966
Young man, learn your vows.

156
00:14:20.106 --> 00:14:24.446
Well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?

157
00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:40.876
Oh, Victoria.

158
00:14:41.336 --> 00:14:45.766
She must think I'm such a fool.
This day couldn't get any worse.

159
00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:52.646
Hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins
as Van Dort boy causes chaos!

160
00:14:52.646 --> 00:14:56.816
Fishy fiancé could be canned!

161
00:14:56.816 --> 00:15:02.886
Everglots all fired up
as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

162
00:15:04.066 --> 00:15:06.726
It really shouldn't be all that difficult.

163
00:15:06.826 --> 00:15:09.156
It's just a few simple vows.

164
00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:13.376
With this hand, I will take your wine.

165
00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:14.786
No.

166
00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:17.876
With this hand...

167
00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.546
...I will cup your...

168
00:15:19.716 --> 00:15:21.296
Oh, goodness, no.

169
00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:27.596
With this...

170
00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:30.176
With this candle, I will...

171
00:15:31.886 --> 00:15:33.436
I will...

172
00:15:34.096 --> 00:15:36.226
I will set your mother on fire.

173
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.856
Oh, it's no use.

174
00:15:52.407 --> 00:15:57.207
With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

175
00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:01.877
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

176
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:04.837
Mrs. Everglot.

177
00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:07.717
You look ravishing this evening.

178
00:16:08.557 --> 00:16:13.807
What's that, Mr. Everglot?
Call you "Dad"? If you insist, sir.

179
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:18.507
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

180
00:16:18.817 --> 00:16:20.477
With this ring...

181
00:16:21.237 --> 00:16:24.857
...I ask you to be mine.

182
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:19.497
I do.

183
00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:51.178
You may kiss the bride.

184
00:18:58.178 --> 00:19:01.518
- A new arrival.
- He must've fainted.

185
00:19:01.518 --> 00:19:04.478
- Are you all right?
- What...? What happened?

186
00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:07.768
By Jove, man. Looks like
we've got ourselves a breather.

187
00:19:07.988 --> 00:19:10.858
- Does he have a dead brother?
- He's still soft.

188
00:19:13.868 --> 00:19:15.488
A toast, then.

189
00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:22.958
To the newlyweds.

190
00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.208
Newlyweds?

191
00:19:25.168 --> 00:19:29.418
In the woods,
you said your vows so perfectly.

192
00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.218
I did?

193
00:19:31.218 --> 00:19:32.798
I did.

194
00:19:32.798 --> 00:19:35.348
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

195
00:19:37.098 --> 00:19:40.268
Coming through, coming through.

196
00:19:40.268 --> 00:19:43.438
My name is Paul, I am the head waiter.

197
00:19:44.228 --> 00:19:47.468
I will be creating your wedding feast.

198
00:19:47.518 --> 00:19:49.898
Wedding feast! I'm salivating.

199
00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:52.108
Maggots.

200
00:19:54.988 --> 00:19:56.618
Keep away!

201
00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:05.418
I've got a...
I've got a dwarf.

202
00:20:05.418 --> 00:20:08.879
And I'm not afraid to use him.
I want some questions. Now!

203
00:20:08.879 --> 00:20:13.009
- Answers. I think you mean "answers."
- Thank you, yes, answers.

204
00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:16.799
I need answers.
What's going on here? Where am I?

205
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.099
Who are you?

206
00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:21.769
Well, that's kind of a long story.

207
00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:24.389
What a story it is.

208
00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:28.149
A tragic tale of romance, passion...

209
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:30.109
...and murder most foul.

210
00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:31.689
This is gonna be good.

211
00:20:33.819 --> 00:20:35.489
Hit it, boys.

212
00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:49.879
<i>Hey, give me a listen
You corpses of cheer</i>

213
00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:52.799
<i>At least those of you
Who still got an ear</i>

214
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:55.759
<i>I'll tell you a story
Make a skeleton cry</i>

215
00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:59.429
<i>Of our own jubiliciously
Lovely Corpse Bride</i>

216
00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:02.019
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

217
00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:04.939
<i>But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay</i>

218
00:21:04.939 --> 00:21:07.649
<i>You might try and hide
And you might try and pray</i>

219
00:21:07.649 --> 00:21:10.979
<i>But we all end up
The remains of the day</i>

220
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.319
That's right.

221
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:19.829
<i>Well, our girl was a beauty
Known for miles around</i>

222
00:21:19.829 --> 00:21:22.909
<i>When a mysterious stranger
Came into town</i>

223
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:25.709
<i>He was plenty good-looking
But down on his cash</i>

224
00:21:25.709 --> 00:21:28.789
<i>And our poor little baby
She fell hard and fast</i>

225
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:31.799
<i>When her daddy said no
She just couldn't cope</i>

226
00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:34.579
<i>So our lovers came up
With a plan to elope</i>

227
00:21:35.049 --> 00:21:37.679
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

228
00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:40.929
<i>But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay</i>

229
00:21:40.929 --> 00:21:43.639
<i>You might try and hide
And you might try and pray</i>

230
00:21:43.639 --> 00:21:46.989
<i>But we all end up
The remains of the day</i>

231
00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:05.079
That's right.

232
00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:09.329
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up.

233
00:22:10.209 --> 00:22:13.419
Yeah. Like it.

234
00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:15.590
Okay, Chancy, take it.

235
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.840
Yeah.

236
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.060
Yeah!

237
00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.900
That's nice.

238
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.660
<i>So they conjured up a plan
To meet late at night</i>

239
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.200
<i>They told not a soul
Kept the whole thing tight</i>

240
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.910
<i>Now, her mother's wedding dress
Fit like a glove</i>

241
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.620
<i>You don't need much
When you're really in love</i>

242
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.120
<i>Except for a few things
Or so I'm told</i>

243
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.920
<i>Like the family jewels
And a satchel of gold</i>

244
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.590
<i>Then next to the graveyard
By the old oak tree</i>

245
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.010
<i>On a dark foggy night
At a quarter to 3</i>

246
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.470
<i>She was ready to go
But where was he?</i>

247
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.720
<i>And then?</i>

248
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.720
<i>- She waited
- And then?</i>

249
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.770
<i>- There in the shadows, was it her man?
- And then?</i>

250
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.590
<i>- Her little heart beat so loud
- And then?</i>

251
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.780
<i>And then, baby, everything went black</i>

252
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.150
<i>Now, when she opened her eyes
She was dead as dust</i>

253
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.200
<i>Her jewels were missing
And her heart was bust</i>

254
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.950
<i>So she made a vow
Lying under that tree</i>

255
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.910
<i>That she'd wait for her true love
To come set her free</i>

256
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.280
<i>Always waiting for someone
To ask for her hand</i>

257
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.420
<i>Then out of the blue
Comes this groovy young man</i>

258
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.340
<i>Who vows forever
To be by her side</i>

259
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.340
<i>And that's the story
Of our Corpse Bride</i>

260
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.260
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

261
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.180
<i>But don't wear a frown,
Because it's really okay</i>

262
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.180
<i>You might try and hide
And you might try and pray</i>

263
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:56.970
<i>But we all end up
The remains of the day</i>

264
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.520
Yeah.

265
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.870
Victoria, come away from the window.

266
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.380
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.

267
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.710
He's terrified of the dark.
In fact, when he was a boy...

268
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.970
...he used to wet his combinations
regularly, didn't he, William?

269
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.180
Enter.

270
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:33.311
Lord Barkis.
I trust the room is to your liking.

271
00:24:33.311 --> 00:24:37.061
Thank you,
you are a most gracious hostess.

272
00:24:37.061 --> 00:24:43.321
Which is why it pains me
to be the bearer of such bad news.

273
00:24:47.321 --> 00:24:51.121
Would you care
to repeat tonight's headline for us?

274
00:24:51.121 --> 00:24:53.311
Hear ye, hear ye!

275
00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:58.081
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the
bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!

276
00:24:58.081 --> 00:25:02.711
The dark-haired temptress and Master
Van Dort slipped away into the night!

277
00:25:02.711 --> 00:25:04.761
And now, the weather.
Scattered showers...

278
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:07.221
Enough! That will be all.

279
00:25:10.181 --> 00:25:13.891
Mystery woman?
He doesn't even know any women!

280
00:25:13.891 --> 00:25:15.941
Or so you thought.

281
00:25:16.811 --> 00:25:19.231
Do call for me
if you need my assistance...

282
00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:22.441
...in any way.

283
00:25:23.941 --> 00:25:27.071
Good heavens, Finis,
what should we do?

284
00:25:27.071 --> 00:25:28.741
Fetch me musket.

285
00:25:28.741 --> 00:25:30.331
William, do something.

286
00:25:30.331 --> 00:25:33.041
The town crier
probably just had a slow news day.

287
00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:36.001
You know how it is,
you need a little something to cry about.

288
00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:40.671
Regardless, we are one groom short
for the wedding tomorrow.

289
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:44.011
Not to mention
the financial implications.

290
00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:47.171
A most scandalous embarrassment
for us all.

291
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:50.601
Oh, give us a chance to find him,
we beg of you.

292
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:54.431
- Just give us until dawn.
- Very well. Till dawn.

293
00:25:55.141 --> 00:25:58.601
Victor, darling, where are you?

294
00:25:59.021 --> 00:26:02.861
<i>If you ask me,
your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.</i>

295
00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:05.441
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.

296
00:26:05.441 --> 00:26:07.861
Victor, where have you gone?

297
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:09.911
I'll keep an eye out for him.

298
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:11.371
Victor?

299
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:18.791
There he goes, there he goes!
He's... He's getting away!

300
00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:21.001
Quick, quick, after him!

301
00:26:21.001 --> 00:26:22.251
Victor.

302
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:28.921
Thank you.

303
00:26:29.261 --> 00:26:30.681
Victor!

304
00:26:31.181 --> 00:26:33.181
Where are you?

305
00:26:35.182 --> 00:26:36.722
Victor?

306
00:26:37.392 --> 00:26:39.742
Where have you gone?

307
00:26:39.982 --> 00:26:42.692
Married, huh? I'm a widow.

308
00:26:42.692 --> 00:26:45.522
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

309
00:26:47.192 --> 00:26:48.902
Victor.

310
00:26:50.202 --> 00:26:51.952
Victor, darling.

311
00:26:53.492 --> 00:26:57.202
Please. There's been a mistake.
I'm not dead.

312
00:27:00.872 --> 00:27:03.712
Excuse me. Excuse me.

313
00:27:04.632 --> 00:27:05.752
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

314
00:27:06.302 --> 00:27:07.842
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

315
00:27:08.632 --> 00:27:10.092
Victor.

316
00:27:12.052 --> 00:27:15.342
- Dead end.
- Victor!

317
00:27:15.432 --> 00:27:16.892
Hello!

318
00:27:25.442 --> 00:27:27.982
Could have used the stairs, silly.

319
00:27:30.452 --> 00:27:34.662
Isn't the view beautiful?
It takes my breath away.

320
00:27:35.872 --> 00:27:38.122
Well, it would if I had any.

321
00:27:39.792 --> 00:27:42.002
Isn't it romantic?

322
00:27:49.422 --> 00:27:53.042
Look, I am terribly sorry
about what's happened to you...

323
00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:56.302
...and I'd like to help,
but I really need to get home.

324
00:27:56.302 --> 00:27:59.642
- This is your home now.
- But I don't even know your name.

325
00:27:59.642 --> 00:28:03.272
<i>Well, that's a great way
to start a marriage.</i>

326
00:28:03.272 --> 00:28:04.692
Shut up!

327
00:28:06.692 --> 00:28:09.732
- It's Emily.
- Emily.

328
00:28:09.732 --> 00:28:13.572
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

329
00:28:14.532 --> 00:28:16.632
It's a wedding present.

330
00:28:29.632 --> 00:28:30.962
Thank you.

331
00:28:52.863 --> 00:28:54.153
Scraps?

332
00:28:56.533 --> 00:28:57.993
Scraps!

333
00:28:58.533 --> 00:29:00.123
My dog, Scraps!

334
00:29:02.623 --> 00:29:05.753
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

335
00:29:05.753 --> 00:29:08.083
I knew you'd be happy to see him.

336
00:29:08.083 --> 00:29:12.463
Who's my good boy?
Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.

337
00:29:12.463 --> 00:29:15.883
Good boy, Scraps.
Roll over. Roll over.

338
00:29:15.883 --> 00:29:18.803
Good boy, Scraps.
Play dead.

339
00:29:20.563 --> 00:29:21.973
Sorry.

340
00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:24.183
Oh, what a cutie.

341
00:29:24.183 --> 00:29:26.273
You should have seen him with fur.

342
00:29:27.103 --> 00:29:30.153
Mother never approved
of Scraps jumping up like this.

343
00:29:30.153 --> 00:29:33.573
But then again,
she never approved of anything.

344
00:29:34.073 --> 00:29:36.773
Do you think
she would have approved of me?

345
00:29:36.863 --> 00:29:39.483
You're lucky
you'll never have to meet her.

346
00:29:41.533 --> 00:29:42.833
Well, actually...

347
00:29:44.253 --> 00:29:48.183
...now that you mention it,
I think you should.

348
00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:51.303
In fact, since we're, you know...

349
00:29:52.303 --> 00:29:55.313
...married,
you should definitely meet her.

350
00:29:55.383 --> 00:29:58.343
And my father too. We should go
and see them right now.

351
00:29:58.343 --> 00:30:01.093
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?

352
00:30:03.013 --> 00:30:06.353
- What? What is it?
- They're not from around here.

353
00:30:06.353 --> 00:30:07.893
Where are they?

354
00:30:08.813 --> 00:30:10.693
Oh, they're still alive.

355
00:30:10.693 --> 00:30:12.983
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, that is a problem.

356
00:30:12.983 --> 00:30:14.363
What's that, Scraps?

357
00:30:15.693 --> 00:30:17.653
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

358
00:30:19.573 --> 00:30:23.633
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.
- What?

359
00:30:23.663 --> 00:30:25.743
Elder Gutknecht.

360
00:30:34.673 --> 00:30:35.843
Scraps.

361
00:30:35.843 --> 00:30:38.373
Elder Gutknecht...

362
00:30:38.593 --> 00:30:40.093
...are you there?

363
00:30:43.103 --> 00:30:46.063
Hello? Is anyone home?

364
00:30:46.933 --> 00:30:48.393
Hello?

365
00:30:59.784 --> 00:31:01.494
There you are!

366
00:31:02.164 --> 00:31:04.744
Oh, my dear. There you are.

367
00:31:04.744 --> 00:31:07.334
I've brought my husband, Victor.

368
00:31:07.334 --> 00:31:10.324
What's that? Husband?

369
00:31:10.504 --> 00:31:12.754
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

370
00:31:13.544 --> 00:31:18.134
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the land of the living.

371
00:31:18.134 --> 00:31:20.384
Land of the living?

372
00:31:23.184 --> 00:31:24.604
Oh, my dear.

373
00:31:24.604 --> 00:31:26.564
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

374
00:31:26.564 --> 00:31:30.564
Now, why go up there, when
people are dying to get down here?

375
00:31:30.564 --> 00:31:33.654
Sir, I beg you to help.
It means so much to me...

376
00:31:34.774 --> 00:31:39.034
- Us.
- I don't know, it's just not natural.

377
00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:41.114
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

378
00:31:41.114 --> 00:31:43.744
Surely there must be something
you can do.

379
00:31:45.704 --> 00:31:48.534
Let me see what I can do.

380
00:31:48.664 --> 00:31:51.544
Where did I put that book?

381
00:31:58.214 --> 00:32:00.464
I left it here somewhere.

382
00:32:03.844 --> 00:32:05.974
There's the one.

383
00:32:19.694 --> 00:32:21.284
I have it.

384
00:32:21.694 --> 00:32:26.674
A Ukrainian haunting spell.
Just the thing for these quick trips.

385
00:32:26.994 --> 00:32:30.744
- So glad you thought of this.
- Me too.

386
00:32:54.354 --> 00:32:55.734
Now, then...

387
00:32:56.944 --> 00:32:58.364
...where were we?

388
00:32:59.574 --> 00:33:01.654
The Ukrainian haunting spell?

389
00:33:10.835 --> 00:33:13.915
Here we have it. Ready?

390
00:33:13.915 --> 00:33:18.005
Just remember, when you
want to come back, say "Hopscotch."

391
00:33:18.005 --> 00:33:20.755
- Hopscotch?
- That's it.

392
00:33:37.275 --> 00:33:39.655
I spent so long in the darkness...

393
00:33:39.655 --> 00:33:44.365
...I'd almost forgotten how beautiful
the moonlight is.

394
00:34:11.645 --> 00:34:13.935
Hey, I think you dropped something.

395
00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.665
Hold on, hold on.

396
00:34:36.665 --> 00:34:41.605
I think I should prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.

397
00:34:42.715 --> 00:34:44.975
I'll go ahead and you...

398
00:34:45.515 --> 00:34:47.465
...wait here.

399
00:34:47.555 --> 00:34:50.485
- Perfect.
- I won't be long.

400
00:34:51.015 --> 00:34:54.105
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

401
00:34:54.105 --> 00:34:55.685
Okay.

402
00:34:56.395 --> 00:34:58.105
No peeking.

403
00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:20.466
If ever I see that Van Dort boy...

404
00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:23.886
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.

405
00:35:23.886 --> 00:35:28.216
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.

406
00:35:28.216 --> 00:35:30.596
You'll have to use a rope.

407
00:35:40.486 --> 00:35:45.486
<i>This is the voice of your conscience.
Listen to what I say.</i>

408
00:35:45.486 --> 00:35:49.786
<i>I have a bad feeling about that boy.
You know he is no...</i>

409
00:35:51.786 --> 00:35:54.326
Go chew someone else's ear for a while.

410
00:35:54.326 --> 00:35:58.086
Victor has gone to see his parents,
just like he said.

411
00:35:58.706 --> 00:36:02.756
If I hadn't just been sitting in it,
I would say that you had lost your mind!

412
00:36:02.756 --> 00:36:07.386
I'm sure he has a perfectly
good reason for taking so long.

413
00:36:07.386 --> 00:36:10.766
I am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?

414
00:36:10.766 --> 00:36:11.976
All right, I will.

415
00:36:11.976 --> 00:36:16.556
After all, he couldn't get far
with those cold feet.

416
00:36:55.016 --> 00:36:59.186
- Victoria.
- Victor? I'm so happy to see you.

417
00:36:59.186 --> 00:37:03.386
Come by the fire. Where have you been?
Are you all right?

418
00:37:03.736 --> 00:37:05.396
I... I...

419
00:37:05.606 --> 00:37:06.946
Oh, dear.

420
00:37:07.776 --> 00:37:11.366
You're as cold as death.
What's happened to you?

421
00:37:11.536 --> 00:37:13.406
Your coat.

422
00:37:14.206 --> 00:37:17.316
Victoria, I confess.

423
00:37:18.326 --> 00:37:21.997
This morning
I was terrified of marriage.

424
00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:27.877
But then, on meeting you,
I felt I should be with you always...

425
00:37:27.877 --> 00:37:31.887
...and that our wedding
could not come soon enough.

426
00:37:34.847 --> 00:37:38.307
Victor, I feel the same.

427
00:37:43.187 --> 00:37:46.027
Victoria, I se... I se...

428
00:37:46.027 --> 00:37:48.737
I seem to find myself married.

429
00:37:48.737 --> 00:37:51.487
And you should know it's unexpected.

430
00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:57.657
My darling,
I just wanted to meet...

431
00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:03.247
Darling? Who's this?

432
00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:06.717
- Who is she?
- I'm his wife.

433
00:38:08.127 --> 00:38:10.677
- Victor?
- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

434
00:38:11.137 --> 00:38:13.387
She's dead. Look.

435
00:38:17.057 --> 00:38:18.347
Hopscotch.

436
00:38:21.227 --> 00:38:24.017
No! No! Victoria!

437
00:38:28.897 --> 00:38:31.027
You lied to me!

438
00:38:31.027 --> 00:38:33.697
Just to get back to that other woman.

439
00:38:33.697 --> 00:38:36.787
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.

440
00:38:36.787 --> 00:38:41.327
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.

441
00:38:44.957 --> 00:38:46.757
She's got a point.

442
00:38:47.417 --> 00:38:52.587
And I thought... I thought
this was all going so well.

443
00:39:01.437 --> 00:39:04.897
Look, I'm sorry, but...

444
00:39:04.897 --> 00:39:06.527
...this just can't work.

445
00:39:06.527 --> 00:39:08.437
Why not?

446
00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.817
It's my eye, isn't it?

447
00:39:11.817 --> 00:39:13.617
No. Your eye is...

448
00:39:14.617 --> 00:39:15.907
...lovely.

449
00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:21.317
Listen, under different circumstances,
well, who knows?

450
00:39:21.537 --> 00:39:26.087
But we're just too different.
I mean, you're dead.

451
00:39:26.087 --> 00:39:29.298
You should've thought about that
before you asked me to marry you.

452
00:39:29.298 --> 00:39:33.098
Why can't you understand? It was
a mistake. I would never marry you.

453
00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:05.918
Roses for eternal love.

454
00:40:06.998 --> 00:40:09.378
Lilies for sweetness.

455
00:40:12.168 --> 00:40:13.718
Baby's breath.

456
00:40:19.518 --> 00:40:21.308
Why so blue?

457
00:40:21.308 --> 00:40:24.518
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.

458
00:40:24.518 --> 00:40:27.148
<i>Maybe he should
have his head examined.</i>

459
00:40:28.688 --> 00:40:30.648
I could do it.

460
00:40:30.648 --> 00:40:34.318
Or perhaps he does belong with her.
Little Miss Living.

461
00:40:34.318 --> 00:40:37.698
With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

462
00:40:38.198 --> 00:40:42.538
Oh, those girls are ten a penny.
You've got so much more.

463
00:40:42.538 --> 00:40:45.038
You've got... You've got...

464
00:40:45.038 --> 00:40:47.538
You've got a wonderful personality.

465
00:40:54.588 --> 00:40:59.218
<i>What does that wispy little brat have
That you don't have double?</i>

466
00:40:59.218 --> 00:41:03.018
<i>She can't hold a candle
To the beauty of your smile</i>

467
00:41:03.018 --> 00:41:04.438
How about a pulse?

468
00:41:04.438 --> 00:41:05.938
<i>Overrated by a mile</i>

469
00:41:05.938 --> 00:41:07.438
<i>- Overvalued
- Overblown</i>

470
00:41:07.438 --> 00:41:11.228
<i>If he only knew
The you that we know</i>

471
00:41:12.528 --> 00:41:15.848
<i>And that silly little creature
Isn't wearing his ring</i>

472
00:41:15.848 --> 00:41:19.238
<i>And she doesn't play piano
Or dance, or sing</i>

473
00:41:19.238 --> 00:41:21.158
<i>No, she doesn't compare</i>

474
00:41:21.158 --> 00:41:23.578
<i>- But she still breathes air
- Who cares?</i>

475
00:41:23.578 --> 00:41:25.038
<i>- Unimportant
- Overrated</i>

476
00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:27.418
<i>- Overblown
- lf only he could see</i>

477
00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:29.208
<i>How special you can be</i>

478
00:41:29.208 --> 00:41:33.748
<i>If he only knew
The you that we know</i>

479
00:41:39.089 --> 00:41:44.519
<i>If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain</i>

480
00:41:44.769 --> 00:41:48.979
<i>If you cut me with a knife
It's still the same</i>

481
00:41:50.229 --> 00:41:53.689
<i>And I know her heart is beating</i>

482
00:41:53.729 --> 00:41:56.509
<i>And I know that I am dead</i>

483
00:41:56.609 --> 00:41:59.449
<i>Yet the pain here that I feel</i>

484
00:41:59.619 --> 00:42:02.699
<i>Try and tell me it's not real</i>

485
00:42:02.789 --> 00:42:07.649
<i>And it seems that I still have
A tear to shed</i>

486
00:42:11.709 --> 00:42:15.129
<i>The sole redeeming feature
From that little creature</i>

487
00:42:15.129 --> 00:42:16.669
<i>Is that she's alive</i>

488
00:42:16.669 --> 00:42:18.469
<i>- Overrated
- Overblown</i>

489
00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.679
<i>Everybody knows
That's just a temporary state</i>

490
00:42:21.679 --> 00:42:25.059
<i>Which is cured very quickly
When we meet our fate</i>

491
00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:26.769
<i>- Who cares?
- Unimportant</i>

492
00:42:26.769 --> 00:42:28.309
<i>- Overrated
- Overblown</i>

493
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:31.729
<i>If only he could see
How special you can be</i>

494
00:42:31.729 --> 00:42:36.189
<i>If he only knew
The you that we know</i>

495
00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:47.199
<i>If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain</i>

496
00:42:47.199 --> 00:42:51.249
<i>In the ice or in the sun
It's all the same</i>

497
00:42:52.999 --> 00:42:55.969
<i>Yet I feel my heart is aching</i>

498
00:42:56.169 --> 00:42:59.169
<i>Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking</i>

499
00:42:59.169 --> 00:43:01.979
<i>And the pain here that I feel</i>

500
00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:04.889
<i>Try and tell me it's not real</i>

501
00:43:05.179 --> 00:43:08.349
<i>I know that I am dead</i>

502
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:13.769
<i>Yet it seems that I still have
Some tears to shed</i>

503
00:43:22.359 --> 00:43:24.489
It's true, Mother!

504
00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:27.409
Victor is married to a dead woman.

505
00:43:27.409 --> 00:43:32.369
I saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.

506
00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:34.079
Victor was in your room?

507
00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:35.629
I have to help him.

508
00:43:35.629 --> 00:43:37.339
The scandal!

509
00:43:37.339 --> 00:43:41.339
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking like a leaf.

510
00:43:41.339 --> 00:43:43.549
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

511
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:47.100
Fetch her a strait jacket!
She's completely mad!

512
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.970
Come, Hildegarde.

513
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.180
Finis, come to bed at once.

514
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:48.910
What in heaven's name?

515
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.500
Who could that be at this hour?

516
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.290
Miss Everglot.

517
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.170
What are you doing here? You should be
at home, prostrate with grief.

518
00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:05.050
Pastor Galswells,
I have to ask you something.

519
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.640
- This is most irregular.
- Please, I beg of you.

520
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.310
You are the only one in the village who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

521
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.310
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

522
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:21.150
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:

523
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.150
Can the living marry the dead?

524
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.110
What on earth are you speaking about?

525
00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.370
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

526
00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.910
He has a corpse bride!

527
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.620
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

528
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.500
I believe I know the thing to do.

529
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.010
Come with me.

530
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.510
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

531
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:53.350
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

532
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.811
Her mind has come undone, I fear.

533
00:45:55.811 --> 00:45:58.101
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

534
00:45:58.101 --> 00:46:02.821
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

535
00:46:03.441 --> 00:46:04.941
Take her to her room!

536
00:46:04.941 --> 00:46:07.531
No, I'm telling the truth.

537
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.571
Victor needs my help.

538
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:11.991
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

539
00:46:11.991 --> 00:46:15.081
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

540
00:46:15.081 --> 00:46:19.541
...and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.

541
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:24.301
He needs our help! Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

542
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:28.511
Will the mortification never cease?

543
00:46:28.511 --> 00:46:31.891
It will be years before we can show
ourselves in public again.

544
00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:33.311
What shall we do?

545
00:46:33.311 --> 00:46:37.101
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

546
00:46:37.101 --> 00:46:39.561
- Victor.
- Whatever.

547
00:46:39.561 --> 00:46:44.441
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman like Victoria...

548
00:46:44.441 --> 00:46:46.651
...it's positively criminal.

549
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:51.031
Why, if I had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

550
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:55.791
...I would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

551
00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:59.621
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

552
00:46:59.621 --> 00:47:02.671
Alas, I am not married.

553
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:04.711
I was betrothed some years ago...

554
00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:08.881
...but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

555
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:13.491
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

556
00:47:20.981 --> 00:47:24.901
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

557
00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:26.531
You found him?

558
00:47:26.531 --> 00:47:30.151
Make haste, my dear,
our relatives will arrive at any moment.

559
00:47:30.151 --> 00:47:33.951
We must have you looking presentable
for Lord Barkis.

560
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:36.911
Lord Barkis?

561
00:47:37.081 --> 00:47:38.791
He will make a fine husband.

562
00:47:38.791 --> 00:47:42.291
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.

563
00:47:42.291 --> 00:47:44.711
A far better prospect this time.

564
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:48.591
But I do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

565
00:47:48.591 --> 00:47:51.571
- We must.
- Please, I beg of you.

566
00:47:51.631 --> 00:47:53.221
There must be another way.

567
00:47:53.221 --> 00:47:55.301
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

568
00:47:55.301 --> 00:47:57.971
...we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

569
00:47:57.971 --> 00:47:59.831
We are destitute.

570
00:47:59.851 --> 00:48:01.661
But Victor...

571
00:48:01.731 --> 00:48:04.441
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

572
00:48:04.441 --> 00:48:07.482
You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.

573
00:48:10.192 --> 00:48:12.902
- According to plan.
- According to plan.

574
00:48:41.142 --> 00:48:44.982
Oh, my dear.
Oh, don't look at me that way.

575
00:48:44.982 --> 00:48:49.522
You have only to suffer this union
until death do us part.

576
00:48:49.652 --> 00:48:53.822
And that will come sooner
than you think.

577
00:48:56.622 --> 00:48:58.742
Oh, it's almost dawn!
Where could he be?

578
00:48:58.742 --> 00:49:02.002
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!

579
00:49:02.002 --> 00:49:05.872
Heartbroken bride to wed
wealthy newcomer!

580
00:49:05.872 --> 00:49:08.712
Wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.

581
00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.562
Did he say corpse?

582
00:49:10.632 --> 00:49:14.632
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse
would marry our Victor?

583
00:49:14.632 --> 00:49:20.642
Oh, Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

584
00:49:37.202 --> 00:49:39.952
Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?

585
00:49:39.952 --> 00:49:42.412
I think he's trying to kill us.

586
00:50:21.413 --> 00:50:22.743
I...

587
00:50:23.953 --> 00:50:25.793
...think you dropped this.

588
00:50:34.923 --> 00:50:36.263
I'm sorry.

589
00:50:36.673 --> 00:50:40.383
I'm sorry I lied to you
about wanting to see my parents.

590
00:50:40.683 --> 00:50:44.893
It's just this whole day
hasn't gone quite, well...

591
00:50:47.523 --> 00:50:49.193
...according to plan.

592
00:51:54.753 --> 00:51:56.683
Pardon my enthusiasm.

593
00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.753
I like your enthusiasm.

594
00:52:03.393 --> 00:52:07.393
- New arrival! New arrival!
- Lights up!

595
00:52:10.353 --> 00:52:11.733
Hurry up, boys!

596
00:52:14.693 --> 00:52:16.483
Drinks for everyone.

597
00:52:16.483 --> 00:52:17.733
Another pint, sir?

598
00:52:17.733 --> 00:52:19.783
- No, no. Just a half.
- No, no. Just a half.

599
00:52:25.034 --> 00:52:27.874
It is impossible
to get good help anymore.

600
00:52:27.874 --> 00:52:30.754
Welcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!

601
00:52:30.754 --> 00:52:35.584
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
- Mayhew?

602
00:52:37.094 --> 00:52:39.504
Mayhew! How nice to see...

603
00:52:41.764 --> 00:52:43.094
I'm so sorry.

604
00:52:43.094 --> 00:52:47.474
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.

605
00:52:49.564 --> 00:52:53.434
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see
the gentleman is parched?

606
00:52:54.354 --> 00:52:57.444
Mayhew, I have to get back.

607
00:52:57.444 --> 00:53:00.354
They all must be worried sick.
How is everyone?

608
00:53:00.354 --> 00:53:04.284
Well, they're still wondering
where you slipped off to.

609
00:53:04.284 --> 00:53:06.664
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

610
00:53:06.664 --> 00:53:08.414
Yes? Yes, how is she?

611
00:53:08.414 --> 00:53:11.494
Well, she's getting married
this evening.

612
00:53:11.494 --> 00:53:13.664
What? Married to who?

613
00:53:13.664 --> 00:53:17.504
Some newcomer,
Lord Somebody-or-Other.

614
00:53:17.504 --> 00:53:19.004
But that's impossible!

615
00:53:19.004 --> 00:53:21.344
Yeah, with you gone and all...

616
00:53:21.344 --> 00:53:24.724
I guess they didn't wanna
waste the cake.

617
00:53:26.594 --> 00:53:28.174
But how could she?

618
00:53:28.174 --> 00:53:31.214
Women, you can't live with them.

619
00:53:31.214 --> 00:53:33.314
You can't live with...

620
00:53:35.274 --> 00:53:40.864
Time to pick up the pieces and...
You know, and move on, I suppose.

621
00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:43.614
Speaking of picking up the pieces?

622
00:53:47.034 --> 00:53:50.324
Victor? Where are you going?

623
00:53:53.504 --> 00:53:58.334
Miss Victoria, we must leave
for the church now.

624
00:53:58.714 --> 00:54:02.384
Yesterday I thought my wedding
would be happy.

625
00:54:02.384 --> 00:54:06.554
Now I feel like I'm caught
in the tide, pulled out to sea.

626
00:54:06.554 --> 00:54:10.264
The sea leads to many places, dearie.

627
00:54:11.184 --> 00:54:14.684
Maybe you'll land somewhere better.

628
00:54:20.524 --> 00:54:25.074
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

629
00:54:31.124 --> 00:54:36.795
With this ring,
I ask you to be mine.

630
00:54:40.585 --> 00:54:45.215
I now pronounce you man and wife.

631
00:54:45.805 --> 00:54:47.765
Oh, oh, dear.

632
00:55:03.735 --> 00:55:05.655
I'm too late.

633
00:55:09.905 --> 00:55:12.575
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?

634
00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:17.155
He just walked off without saying
a word. Are all men like this?

635
00:55:17.155 --> 00:55:20.005
Well, I'm afraid none of them
are very bright.

636
00:55:20.005 --> 00:55:22.085
They get something stuck
in their heads...

637
00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:24.635
...and you can't do a thing with them.

638
00:55:25.635 --> 00:55:28.265
My dear, we have to talk.

639
00:55:28.265 --> 00:55:32.765
- Let me tell her, please. Let me tell her.
- What?

640
00:55:32.765 --> 00:55:35.805
There is a complication
with your marriage.

641
00:55:36.315 --> 00:55:37.975
I don't understand.

642
00:55:37.975 --> 00:55:42.445
The vows are binding
only until death do you part.

643
00:55:42.815 --> 00:55:44.105
What are you saying?

644
00:55:44.815 --> 00:55:47.975
Death has already parted you.

645
00:55:48.785 --> 00:55:50.785
If he finds out, he'll leave.

646
00:55:50.785 --> 00:55:52.995
There must be something you can do.

647
00:55:52.995 --> 00:55:55.955
Well, there is one way.

648
00:55:55.955 --> 00:55:57.995
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.

649
00:55:57.995 --> 00:56:01.045
It requires the greatest sacrifice.

650
00:56:01.625 --> 00:56:05.175
- Go on, get to the good part.
- What is it?

651
00:56:05.175 --> 00:56:08.055
- We have to kill him!
- What?

652
00:56:08.055 --> 00:56:13.185
Victor would have to give up
the life he had forever.

653
00:56:13.185 --> 00:56:17.185
He would need to repeat his vows
in the land of the living...

654
00:56:17.185 --> 00:56:20.475
...and drink from the wine of ages.

655
00:56:21.315 --> 00:56:22.565
Poison!

656
00:56:22.815 --> 00:56:26.355
This would stop his heart forever.

657
00:56:26.355 --> 00:56:29.905
Only then would he be free
to give it to you.

658
00:56:32.495 --> 00:56:35.035
I could never ask him.

659
00:56:37.495 --> 00:56:39.335
You don't have to.

660
00:56:41.836 --> 00:56:43.426
I'll do it.

661
00:56:43.546 --> 00:56:46.676
My boy, if you choose this path...

662
00:56:46.676 --> 00:56:49.676
...you may never return
to the world above.

663
00:56:49.676 --> 00:56:51.266
Do you understand?

664
00:56:54.686 --> 00:56:56.686
I do.

665
00:56:57.016 --> 00:56:59.896
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.

666
00:57:03.646 --> 00:57:06.356
We've decided to do this thing properly.

667
00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:08.946
So grab what you can and follow us.

668
00:57:08.946 --> 00:57:11.696
We're moving this wedding party upstairs.

669
00:57:11.696 --> 00:57:16.036
Upstairs? I didn't know
we had an upstairs.

670
00:57:16.036 --> 00:57:18.576
- Sounds creepy.
- Let's go!

671
00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:22.086
<i>A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have a wedding</i>

672
00:57:24.756 --> 00:57:26.996
Hold on, Victor.

673
00:57:27.086 --> 00:57:30.466
You can't get married looking like that.

674
00:57:30.466 --> 00:57:33.926
<i>The spiders think you're very cute
But goodness knows you need a suit</i>

675
00:57:33.926 --> 00:57:37.976
<i>But have no fears, we're quite adept
We'll have you looking lovely, lovely, lovely</i>

676
00:57:37.976 --> 00:57:40.356
<i>Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely yet</i>

677
00:57:41.186 --> 00:57:44.526
<i>A little stitch, a little tuck
Some tender loving care</i>

678
00:57:44.526 --> 00:57:47.816
<i>A little thread will fix you up
And we've got plenty as you see</i>

679
00:57:47.816 --> 00:57:51.366
<i>And personally guarantee
Our quality repairs</i>

680
00:57:51.366 --> 00:57:54.946
<i>A little here, I'll fix the mess
We're going to do our very best</i>

681
00:57:54.946 --> 00:57:57.746
<i>When everybody sees you
They will all be quite impressed</i>

682
00:57:57.746 --> 00:58:01.786
<i>They will all be quite impressed</i>

683
00:58:01.786 --> 00:58:03.665
<i>A wedding, we're going to have</i>

684
00:58:03.665 --> 00:58:06.926
<i>A wedding cake is no mistake
It must be quite sublime</i>

685
00:58:06.926 --> 00:58:08.836
<i>- We're missing something
- Try some dust</i>

686
00:58:08.836 --> 00:58:10.346
<i>I wish I had more time</i>

687
00:58:10.346 --> 00:58:13.426
<i>Perhaps there's something I can do
These bones might help a bit</i>

688
00:58:13.426 --> 00:58:15.426
- Oh, my nose.
- Sorry.

689
00:58:15.426 --> 00:58:16.846
<i>Wait a minute, that's it</i>

690
00:58:16.846 --> 00:58:18.436
<i>- A little of that
- A little of this</i>

691
00:58:18.436 --> 00:58:20.306
<i>The perfect cake is hard to miss</i>

692
00:58:20.306 --> 00:58:22.766
<i>A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have</i>

693
00:58:22.766 --> 00:58:24.226
<i>A wedding</i>

694
00:58:24.226 --> 00:58:26.026
<i>Huzzah, huzzah</i>

695
00:58:26.026 --> 00:58:28.566
<i>We're going to have a wedding
A wedding</i>

696
00:58:29.196 --> 00:58:34.986
<i>Let's all give out a cheer
'Cause the bride is getting married today</i>

697
00:58:36.286 --> 00:58:39.366
<i>One thing you can surely say
Is we will stand beside</i>

698
00:58:39.366 --> 00:58:42.456
<i>Until the end we will defend
Our one and only bride</i>

699
00:58:42.456 --> 00:58:45.796
<i>Our bride-to-be, our bride-to-be
Our lovely Corpse Bride</i>

700
00:58:45.796 --> 00:58:47.796
<i>Huzzah! Hooray! Huzzah! Hooray!</i>

701
00:58:47.796 --> 00:58:52.177
<i>Our bride is getting married today</i>

702
00:58:52.177 --> 00:58:54.437
- Oh, there she is.
- Here she comes.

703
00:58:59.437 --> 00:59:03.267
<i>Oh, oh, the bride is here</i>

704
00:59:03.267 --> 00:59:07.237
<i>She's waited for this day
For many a year</i>

705
00:59:07.237 --> 00:59:11.567
<i>For this day, for this day
Our hopes and our pride</i>

706
00:59:11.567 --> 00:59:17.997
<i>The bride is here
Here comes the bride</i>

707
00:59:17.997 --> 00:59:21.957
<i>Here comes the bride
Here comes the bride</i>

708
00:59:22.167 --> 00:59:26.297
<i>For this day, for this day
Will last forever</i>

709
00:59:26.297 --> 00:59:30.257
<i>And all of her friends
Will work together</i>

710
00:59:30.257 --> 00:59:34.137
<i>To make it the perfect day
She's always dreamed</i>

711
00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:41.347
<i>Our hopes and our pride
Our bride, our lovely bride</i>

712
00:59:42.017 --> 00:59:44.937
<i>We're going to have a party
Like nobody's ever seen</i>

713
00:59:44.937 --> 00:59:48.817
<i>The living in the land above
Will not know where they've been</i>

714
00:59:48.817 --> 00:59:55.447
<i>The land above
The party of the bride</i>

715
00:59:56.277 --> 01:00:02.247
<i>Here comes the bride
On this glorious day of days</i>

716
01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:07.167
<i>Up to the land of the living</i>

717
01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:14.967
<i>To celebrate</i>

718
01:00:17.387 --> 01:00:19.887
Oh, dear.

719
01:00:31.357 --> 01:00:34.737
Quiet down now, everyone.

720
01:00:39.237 --> 01:00:40.737
Thank you.

721
01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:46.247
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

722
01:00:46.917 --> 01:00:49.837
Victoria has found a husband...

723
01:00:49.837 --> 01:00:54.177
...with all these qualities and more.

724
01:00:54.177 --> 01:00:56.927
Serendipity brought us together...

725
01:00:56.927 --> 01:01:02.268
...and no force on earth
could tear us apart.

726
01:01:22.788 --> 01:01:25.118
There's an eye in me soup.

727
01:01:34.628 --> 01:01:35.628
Oh, sorry.

728
01:01:42.678 --> 01:01:43.888
Fetch me musket!

729
01:01:44.058 --> 01:01:46.178
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!

730
01:01:46.348 --> 01:01:48.598
Coming through. Coming through.

731
01:01:51.858 --> 01:01:56.998
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but I used to live in your dead mother.

732
01:01:57.908 --> 01:01:59.528
Hey, hold on there.

733
01:02:00.028 --> 01:02:03.578
I love a woman with meat on her bones.

734
01:02:04.828 --> 01:02:07.368
Finis, who invited these people?

735
01:02:08.328 --> 01:02:10.628
They must be from your side
of the family.

736
01:02:10.628 --> 01:02:12.038
Certainly not.

737
01:02:12.038 --> 01:02:16.168
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

738
01:02:16.168 --> 01:02:18.128
Finis.

739
01:02:19.638 --> 01:02:21.848
Where do you keep the spirits?

740
01:02:30.688 --> 01:02:34.858
In other news, the dead walk the earth!

741
01:02:39.568 --> 01:02:43.448
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!

742
01:02:43.448 --> 01:02:44.908
Get back!

743
01:02:46.288 --> 01:02:48.118
I'll give you such a wallop.

744
01:02:59.678 --> 01:03:00.928
No.

745
01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:02.468
Yeah.

746
01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:18.739
Grandpa?

747
01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:23.909
- Bounder!
- Sweetie pie.

748
01:03:24.079 --> 01:03:25.489
- Monster.
- Buttercup.

749
01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:27.449
- Cad!
- Gertrude!

750
01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:29.449
Alfred?

751
01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:34.209
You've been dead for 15 years.

752
01:03:34.209 --> 01:03:38.259
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

753
01:03:38.259 --> 01:03:40.009
Ethel!

754
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:52.139
Wait. That's it.

755
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:55.899
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.

756
01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:58.479
Money? What money?

757
01:03:58.479 --> 01:04:01.029
Your dowry. It's my right!

758
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:03.199
But my parents don't have any money.

759
01:04:03.199 --> 01:04:08.079
It's my marriage to you that will
save them from the poorhouse.

760
01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:10.159
Th... The poorhouse?

761
01:04:10.619 --> 01:04:14.629
You're lying. It isn't true.
Tell me that you're lying!

762
01:04:14.629 --> 01:04:18.629
Did things not go according
to your plan, Lord Barkis?

763
01:04:18.629 --> 01:04:23.429
Well, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectly matched.

764
01:04:42.239 --> 01:04:45.199
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

765
01:04:45.199 --> 01:04:49.449
Back to the void
from whence you came!

766
01:04:49.449 --> 01:04:51.409
You shall not enter here.

767
01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:54.169
Back, back!

768
01:04:54.169 --> 01:04:56.539
Keep it down, we're in a church.

769
01:04:56.539 --> 01:04:58.459
Evening.

770
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.420
Dearly beloved and departed...

771
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:43.130
...we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.

772
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:48.430
Victor?

773
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:51.890
Living first.

774
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:55.520
With this hand...

775
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:58.770
...I will lift your sorrows.

776
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.650
Your cup will never empty...

777
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.190
...for I will be your wine.

778
01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.360
Now you.

779
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.580
With this hand...

780
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.080
...I will lift your sorrows.

781
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.750
Your cup will never empty.

782
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.550
For I will be...

783
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.850
I will be...

784
01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:36.390
Go on, my dear.

785
01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.770
Your cup...

786
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.520
...will never empty...

787
01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.650
...for I will be...

788
01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.990
I will be your wine.

789
01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.240
She's having second thoughts.

790
01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:00.460
I can't.

791
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.790
What's wrong?

792
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.920
This is wrong.

793
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.260
I was a bride.

794
01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.300
My dreams were taken from me.

795
01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.760
Well, now...

796
01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.310
Now I've stolen them
from someone else.

797
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.560
I love you, Victor.

798
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.231
But you're not mine.

799
01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:31.861
Victoria!

800
01:07:46.671 --> 01:07:49.841
Oh, how touching.

801
01:07:50.011 --> 01:07:53.501
I always cry at weddings.

802
01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:58.601
Our young lovers together at last.

803
01:07:58.601 --> 01:08:03.201
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

804
01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:05.441
But you forget...

805
01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:07.691
...she's still my wife!

806
01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:10.861
I'll not leave here empty-handed!

807
01:08:11.701 --> 01:08:13.361
You?

808
01:08:15.871 --> 01:08:17.281
Emily?

809
01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:18.661
You!

810
01:08:18.831 --> 01:08:21.831
But... But... I left you.

811
01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:24.711
For dead.

812
01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:27.881
This woman is obviously delusional!

813
01:08:35.051 --> 01:08:38.511
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

814
01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:40.891
Take your hands off her.

815
01:08:41.891 --> 01:08:44.691
Do I have to kill you too?

816
01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:51.071
Victor, catch!

817
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:53.241
Sorry.

818
01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:10.211
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.

819
01:09:52.052 --> 01:09:53.962
Touché, my dear.

820
01:09:54.552 --> 01:09:55.882
Get out.

821
01:09:56.632 --> 01:09:59.432
Oh, I'm leaving.

822
01:10:03.932 --> 01:10:07.102
But first a toast. To Emily.

823
01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:11.522
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

824
01:10:11.982 --> 01:10:13.822
Tell me, my dear...

825
01:10:13.822 --> 01:10:17.902
...can a heart still break
once it's stopped beating?

826
01:10:20.912 --> 01:10:22.532
Let me at him! Let me at him!

827
01:10:22.532 --> 01:10:24.122
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

828
01:10:25.372 --> 01:10:28.172
We must abide by their rules.

829
01:10:28.172 --> 01:10:31.382
We are amongst the living.

830
01:10:31.542 --> 01:10:33.422
Well said.

831
01:10:49.352 --> 01:10:51.312
Not anymore.

832
01:10:54.862 --> 01:10:57.742
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.

833
01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.172
New arrival.

834
01:11:17.842 --> 01:11:21.802
Oh, Victor,
I never thought I'd see you again.

835
01:11:29.142 --> 01:11:30.642
Wait.

836
01:11:31.402 --> 01:11:33.652
I made a promise.

837
01:11:36.362 --> 01:11:38.942
You kept your promise.

838
01:11:39.782 --> 01:11:41.742
You set me free.

839
01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:55.633
Now I can do the same for you.
