1
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.886
I want to be a light,
but it feels so dark.

2
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.326
It's like...

3
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.881
I have a heavy heart
and this burden on my back.

4
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.004
There's something in me
that makes me want to cry...

5
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.971
...and I don't even know what it is.

6
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.602
America and the world mourns,

7
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.087
as the biggest school shooting
in U.S. history

8
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.806
took place today at Columbine High School.

9
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.002
According to reports,

10
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.285
two gunmen came in shooting, and began
working their way through the school.

11
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.091
What police and everyone else
are looking for now is a reason

12
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.248
for the violence
that tore this quiet school

13
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.569
and suburban neighborhood apart
just weeks before graduation.

14
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.770
Rach, it's okay.

15
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.929
Just try and get some sleep.

16
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.686
Are they getting a divorce?

17
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.681
Mom? Can you pay for my car insurance?

18
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.848
- You said you would.
- Um...

19
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.200
Yeah, I don't know yet.

20
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.800
It's really expensive, Bethanie.

21
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.321
Unbelievable. This is so lame.

22
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.847
Oh, you know what? I picked up
some extra houses to clean,

23
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.008
so I'm gonna need your help
with the kids tomorrow.

24
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.605
I'm not their mother.

25
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.609
Okay, guys, now that your dad
doesn't live here anymore,

26
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.564
we're not going to have
as much as we used to.

27
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.163
So each morning, we're going
to pray for what we need. Okay?

28
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.169
Okay.

29
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.403
Dear Jesus, thank you
for these precious children.

30
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.246
You tell us to come to you
for the things that we need.

31
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.849
So, Lord, I pray for gas money
to get to work.

32
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.123
I pray for cute clothes for school.

33
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.521
And car insurance for Bethanie.

34
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.927
And lots of stuffed animals.

35
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.204
Amen.

36
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.489
Congratulations!

37
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.409
- I saw you got the lead!
- Thank you! I did!

38
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.170
Congrats!

39
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.442
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
I'm excited, honestly.

40
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.688
- It only took me three years, so...
- Yeah.

41
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.203
This just proves that no one notices me.

42
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.243
Everybody treats me like I'm 14.

43
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.806
So you didn't get the lead
in the school play.

44
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.809
Who cares? You're just a sophomore.

45
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.686
Uh, Alex was a sophomore when
he got his first lead role.

46
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.041
- It's true.
- I know. He doesn't even know my name.

47
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.648
And Mrs. Diaz said she's gonna
let him write the play next year.

48
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.082
Well... I know Alex a little.

49
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.289
I mean, he was the only boy in
my dance class when we were kids.

50
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.686
He's pretty hot. Mm-hmm.

51
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.280
- For a drama guy.
- Not exactly my type.

52
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.289
We both love acting.

53
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.243
He would be perfect for me.

54
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.327
I could see that.

55
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.920
I just want a real boyfriend.

56
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.691
You know, guys never think of me that way.

57
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.766
Well, let's change that.

58
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.325
I'll get him to notice you.

59
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.124
But first, you have
to stop wearing these hats

60
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.730
that you've been wearing
since the fourth grade.

61
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.410
- Look at me.
- Thank you.

62
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.040
He probably wouldn't like me anyway, so...

63
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.366
Don't say that.

64
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.165
Now, just let me work my magic,

65
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.807
and I'll see if I can arrange
for something this weekend.

66
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.524
You're the best, Maddy.

67
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.562
- Don't call me that.
- Ooh...!

68
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.921
Stop it! I hate it! God!

69
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.202
Now, I'm gonna do the best that I can do,

70
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.048
but I need you to make sure that he
doesn't just see you as a friend,

71
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.242
- if you know what I mean.
- Got it.

72
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.407
Totally.

73
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.921
- Don't ever do that in front of him.
- I was kidding.

74
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.122
- Ever.
- That was bad.

75
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.641
Come on, the guys are already there.

76
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.965
Unless your mom has a crystal ball,
no one's gonna find out.

77
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.401
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.

78
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.483
- We've got liquid courage.
- Rachel!

79
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.170
Come on.

80
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.760
Rachel.

81
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.450
I can hear them from my room.

82
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.766
You know Mom's gonna bust you.

83
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.882
Well, don't say anything.

84
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.606
I'm not gonna lie for you again.

85
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.768
Come on, Dana.

86
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.245
Don't be such a goody-goody.

87
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.242
This night could be huge for me.

88
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.046
Fine.

89
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.004
Thanks. I owe you one. Seriously.

90
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.361
- Rachel!
- It's gonna be kind of weird

91
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.084
hanging out with drama guys.

92
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.090
# In the aftermath #

93
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.168
# My music in my... #

94
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.328
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

95
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.923
Well, that's what he asked me to do.

96
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.530
I think it's kind of cool.

97
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.085
Thank you.

98
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.645
Welcome, ladies.

99
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.411
The pool is open exclusively

100
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.602
- for our personal guests.
- Don't get too nutty,

101
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.200
'cause we're not technically
supposed to be here.

102
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.290
Well, this is Celine,
and this is Gabby, and Rachel.

103
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.051
Alex, you two
should get to know each other.

104
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.525
Have we met before?

105
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.449
I think she tried out for the play.

106
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.767
- Villager number four.
- That's it, yeah.

107
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.844
Well, come on in. The water's warm, and...

108
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.201
- we have drinks.
- So do we.

109
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.922
# La, la, la, la-la... #

110
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.209
I think I'm gonna go check on Gabby
before she pukes in the pool.

111
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.926
- We'll miss you.
- But, hey, you should show Rachel

112
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.884
your ballet moves from the fourth grade.

113
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.490
You know, that's tempting.

114
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.921
I just might.

115
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.167
I'm not like my friends.

116
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.531
What do you mean?

117
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.120
I can't really be fake.

118
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.651
And they are?

119
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.211
No.

120
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.288
No, I didn't mean it like that.

121
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.846
We've been best friends
since elementary school.

122
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.121
It's just...

123
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.571
I mean, look at them.

124
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.170
All the guys want them.

125
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.651
But I want the guy I want
to want what I am and...

126
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.285
not the fake version of what I think

127
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.920
I want to think that they want
to think that I am.

128
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.843
Interesting.

129
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.566
I'm not a social plastic person.

130
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.810
Just wanted to get that out there.

131
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.286
That's cool. What is it?

132
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.284
I don't know, really.

133
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.528
Sometimes I just draw what I feel.

134
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.051
You're an artist?

135
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.764
I'm all right.

136
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.928
I actually write more than I draw.

137
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.724
Oh, I act what I write.

138
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.208
You know, people like us,
we have stories to tell.

139
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.526
You know, and acting, it...

140
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.202
really brings those words to life
so people can really feel it, you know?

141
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.850
Yeah.

142
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.086
That's why all the world's a stage...

143
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.242
And all the men and women merely players.

144
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.170
They have their exits and their entrances.

145
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.850
You like Shakespeare?

146
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.041
Yeah. Course.

147
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.964
I want to write plays, too.

148
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.242
Well, I can help you out,
you know, show you what I know.

149
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.761
- My process.
- That'd be cool.

150
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.321
I can take a look at your
writing, too, if you want.

151
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.329
I connect through writing.

152
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.807
Words are the window to the heart.

153
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.809
Yeah.

154
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.327
You're, like. deep.

155
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.408
Are you spiritual or something?

156
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.767
No.

157
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.281
Not... no, not really.

158
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.968
Really? 'Cause, you know...

159
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.208
I'm a spiritual guy myself.

160
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.565
You know, I like to take in the energy
around me for my art.

161
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.411
Yeah. Guess I'm like that, too.

162
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.760
Mm.

163
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.601
Hey, you guys are too dry! Come in!

164
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.131
No, we're good.

165
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.129
Come on! Come on!

166
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.402
Well... if that's what you want.

167
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.565
You know, I want what you want.

168
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.290
But just in case you wanted to know,

169
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.971
I want you to want
to come in the pool. Just...

170
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.844
wanted to get that out there.

171
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.721
# Here I am #

172
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.684
# Just waiting, and the world #

173
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.167
# Is passing by #

174
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.203
Girl, come here!

175
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.728
# All alone in my sanctuary #

176
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.649
- Oh!
- Careful.

177
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.922
# Coming back to life #

178
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.725
# I wait #

179
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.650
# In the aftermath #

180
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.684
# My music in my mind... #

181
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.605
Bye.

182
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.848
Rachel Joy.

183
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.327
I prayed over pillows tonight.
Where have you been?

184
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.044
Out with the girls.

185
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.924
Why is your hair all wet?

186
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.565
We went swimming.

187
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.842
What if something had happened?

188
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.008
I need to know where my children are.

189
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.849
Sorry, Mom.

190
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.645
You smell like smoke.

191
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.808
And... booze.

192
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.570
Are you buzzing?

193
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.449
Mom, nobody says that.

194
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.167
Oh. Okay, well, you're grounded
till you go to your Aunt Bea's.

195
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.726
What? Mom, that's, like, the whole summer!

196
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.207
Exactly. This kind of behavior
will not be tolerated

197
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.369
- under this roof.
- I told you.

198
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.051
Shut up, Dana.

199
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.842
Rachel, we're gonna have a long
chat about this in the morning.

200
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.930
You're better than this, Rachel Joy.

201
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.486
I can't even control them.

202
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.206
Larry went from no kids
to five kids overnight.

203
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.964
He's still getting used to everything.

204
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.082
I'm so scared that he's gonna regret it.

205
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.527
- Beth, don't say that.
- I think it'll be good

206
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.642
for Rachel to get away
from her friends for a bit.

207
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.522
I'll be. Sometimes I don't know
what I'm gonna do with that girl.

208
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.531
Being at the farm with her cousins
is gonna be good for her.

209
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.207
We have been looking all over for you.

210
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.970
Here I am.

211
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.610
Rach...

212
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.563
you're kind of different this summer.

213
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.251
I just wanted to be alone.

214
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.569
For four hours?

215
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.921
Rachel...

216
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.684
what's really going on?

217
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.080
I just want to help.

218
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.601
Well, you can't.

219
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.768
You would never understand.
Your family's perfect.

220
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.809
No, we're not.

221
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.809
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.922
It wasn't supposed to be like that.

223
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.530
Sometimes I don't know who I am.

224
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.325
It's not like I'm trying
to do the wrong thing.

225
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.482
I just can't help it.

226
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.884
I used to try so hard
to get it all together,

227
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.401
but... none of that worked.

228
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.364
I had to let God in.

229
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.811
I've done the whole church thing.

230
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.651
I know about Jesus.

231
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.047
I know it sounds crazy,
and it's really hard

232
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.210
to explain, but... it's about
truly living a life for Jesus.

233
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.211
And when you do that, you'll
have this sense of peace.

234
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.049
I don't know.

235
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.563
That's just what worked for me.

236
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.363
Rachel, life can be really hard,
but listen to me,

237
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.927
God does not waste anything,
not even the bad things.

238
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.768
# And everybody's got
a wound to be healed #

239
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.962
# I want to believe #

240
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.890
# There's beauty here #

241
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.962
# How many times
have you heard me cry out #

242
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.085
# "God, please take this"? #

243
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.720
# How many times
have you given me strength #

244
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.926
# To just keep breathing? #

245
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.402
Lord, I'm sorry for everything
that I've done.

246
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.204
Jesus, I ask, forgive me,

247
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.722
and I ask you to come into my life.

248
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.680
Father, use me to be a light to the world.

249
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.282
# Oh, I need you #

250
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:43.602
# God, I need you now #

251
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.731
# I need you now #

252
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.562
# I need you now. #

253
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.767
Rach, why do you always draw
the same flower?

254
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.009
Why, are you mad
I haven't drawn it for you yet?

255
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.248
I actually am, thank you.

256
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.806
Rachel, I know you've been thinking about
a lot of things, and sometimes it helps

257
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.884
to just write down your thoughts,
so I wanted to give you this.

258
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.324
Thanks, Aunt Bea.

259
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.681
- You're welcome.
- Love it.

260
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.120
God, I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

261
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.607
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

262
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.249
You know what you're doing,
and you know what's best for me.

263
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.850
From now on,

264
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.204
I put all of my faith
and all of my trust in you.

265
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.166
Hey, Austin.

266
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.089
Oh. Uh, hey, Rachel.

267
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.168
- What a retard.
- Right.

268
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.126
Rachel's got a new... ba-ba-ba-boyfriend.

269
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.645
Not exactly, Sean.

270
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.125
- Ooh...
- Are you jealous, Dylan?

271
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.806
No.

272
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.565
First day of school sucks.

273
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.284
Hey.

274
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.129
- At least the guys have a tan.
- Mm.

275
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.605
Hey, look at these fly girls!

276
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.370
- Brian Riggs!
- What's up?

277
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.721
- Hey! How's football going?
- Hey.

278
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.046
- We're gonna rock this year.
- Well, we'll finally

279
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.924
have something to cheer for, then.

280
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.201
Ha-ha-ha.

281
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.083
Oh, uh, dude, Shep's parents are gone
all semester, so we're gonna have

282
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.009
mad ragers, like, every weekend.

283
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.610
You guys got to come.

284
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.643
- Oh, we'll be there.
- Let us know when.

285
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.046
Yeah, most def.

286
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.003
Hey, uh, this is K.J.

287
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.009
Uh, he just came from California.

288
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.565
Plays linebacker. K.J.,
this is Gabby and Madison.

289
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.045
- Hey.
- What's up?

290
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.487
- Welcome to Columbine.
- Good to meet you.

291
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.886
Let's bounce.

292
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.849
See you around.

293
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.004
See what I mean? Guys don't even see me.

294
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.645
Hey, we're working on it.

295
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.250
Have you talked to Alex yet?

296
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.409
No. But I have drama class
with him sixth period.

297
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.727
Good. This is the time to strike.

298
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.729
- You've got to stay on his radar.
- Totally.

299
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.207
Okay. But I'm not going to be fake.

300
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.721
Girl, you couldn't be fake if you tried.

301
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.122
Dude, you sound like a hyena.

302
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.331
- He looks like a hyena.
- Yeah, seriously, you sound like an idiot.

303
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.489
Let's go! Come on! Get him!

304
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.001
Yo! It's time for dork bowling!

305
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.929
Come on!

306
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.450
Oh!

307
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.686
Strike!

308
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.810
Yes!

309
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.445
I'll kill you, Riggs.

310
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.164
- Oh, I'm so scared.
- Ooh...

311
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.484
Don't look at me.

312
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.211
You got something on your back, yo!

313
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.971
Dude, every time, every time.

314
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.690
I hate those guys.

315
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.609
Just another day at Columbine.

316
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.643
Why does it always have
to be so cliquey here?

317
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.081
I thought it was gonna be
different this year.

318
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.489
One of Hitler's central themes in his writing
is that it was a Nazi's responsibility

319
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.646
to aid evolution by exterminating
less evolved people groups.

320
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.003
In his opinion, that was those
who had different-colored skin,

321
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.202
were religious or were handicapped.

322
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.044
Hitler thought natural selection
should be actively aided.

323
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.843
Come on, dude.

324
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.167
You're never gonna change
what's happening in there.

325
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.250
That's just the way the world is.

326
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.249
Well, I want to change the world.

327
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.091
Okay. Good luck. What's your plan?

328
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.248
Don't know yet.

329
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.483
Do you ever feel like
you can't see your future?

330
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.568
You know, feel like...

331
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.967
like it might be your last year?

332
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.286
No.

333
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.402
Super morbid.

334
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.123
It's not, though.

335
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.202
It's more like...

336
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.810
something big's gonna happen.

337
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.607
Like a chain reaction.

338
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.480
Not sure what that means,
but I'm here for you.

339
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.608
I never made it to class.

340
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.165
Of course you didn't.

341
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.969
Alex Dickerson?

342
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.241
- Really?
- Maybe.

343
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.050
If I work the radar.

344
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.083
Am I gonna lose you
as my prom date already?

345
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.924
I thought that was only
if we couldn't find anyone.

346
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.565
Yeah, well, neither of us have
in three years.

347
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.445
You'll find someone.

348
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.369
Welcome to Advanced Drama.

349
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.643
In this class, you will get
the privilege of creating,

350
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.127
producing and performing the spring play.

351
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.766
Mr. Alex Dickerson here
will be our playwright.

352
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.365
I've got something for you. Hold on.

353
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.084
You know when you meet someone,
and in, like,

354
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.850
the first few minutes
they're, like, a soul mate?

355
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.246
No.

356
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.044
Alex is like that.

357
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.491
He gets me.

358
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.483
It's like he was made for me.

359
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.291
Miss Scott, is there something
that you'd like to share

360
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.482
- with all of us?
- No, not really.

361
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.206
Very nice, Miss Scott.

362
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.203
But this isn't art class.

363
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.964
Uh, theater is one of the six classic
art forms, so I'd argue that...

364
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.009
this is art class.

365
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.446
Brownnoser.

366
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.324
Well, I stand corrected, Mr. Dickerson.

367
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.010
Okay, all of you underclassmen will be
paired with a senior mentor. And...

368
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.930
these papers I just handed you
are your pairings.

369
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.929
I know.

370
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.290
Okay, so, is he still, like, your mentor

371
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.084
- or whatever you call it?
- Yes!

372
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.567
Hey, spazzes. One of you
had better won the lottery.

373
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.330
Alex and Rachel are going to be doing

374
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.727
- drama geek stuff together.
- Oh, this is so perfect.

375
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.842
Okay, he told me that he's gonna be at Shep's
party tomorrow, we have to be there.

376
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.041
Okay.

377
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.606
- Okay! Party!
- Whoo!

378
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.764
Um, can you go get us
some drinks or something?

379
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.640
- Who is that?
- I can't remember his name,

380
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.491
and I feel like it would be
way too awkward to ask now.

381
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.045
Celine...

382
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.562
- you have to be careful. Like, what...
- I'm fine.

383
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.200
- What if he...
- Seriously, I'm fine.

384
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.530
Okay.

385
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.522
Now go do whatever it is you do.

386
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.688
That whole non-fake thing.

387
00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.287
- You can do this.
- Okay.

388
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.611
Hey, mentor.

389
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.406
Hey.

390
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.285
Did you have something to do
with us getting paired up?

391
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.801
Must have been the theater gods.

392
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.241
They might have known that I
missed seeing you this summer.

393
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.523
Yeah, I... got grounded
for most of it, so...

394
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.048
You know, there's a lot
going on behind those eyes.

395
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.766
You should try out
for the female lead in my play.

396
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.362
I'd need a good mentor to help
me prepare for the audition.

397
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.165
Bummer. You're out of luck there.

398
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.845
Alex?

399
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.531
- Hey! How are you?
- Hi. Good. How are you?

400
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.641
I'm great.

401
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.762
- I heard you're writing a play?
- Yeah.

402
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.769
I'll see you in class.

403
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.211
Yeah.

404
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.209
See you Monday.

405
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.288
- How are you?
- I'm doing well. How are you?

406
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.371
- I'm great.
- So, like, what was your inspiration?

407
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.121
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey, Rachel.

408
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.441
You know, that old Acura's
getting pretty lonely.

409
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.090
I don't want to talk right now.

410
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.329
You sure? You should think
about letting me use it.

411
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.526
I just got home from work... I don't
want to have to think about anything.

412
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.562
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, honey.

413
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.489
Are you tired from...

414
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.728
filing debit and credit reports?

415
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.490
And punching the calculator?

416
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.206
- I am, actually.
- Oh. Exhausted.

417
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.288
- Mom, when's Dad coming to get us?
- I don't know.

418
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.402
Uh, he was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

419
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.205
Son, do you have to play
that thing right here?

420
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.810
Son?

421
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.610
I am not your son.

422
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.449
You know, and there's
a logical reason to this,

423
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.525
if you let me drive the car, I could
drive myself to work, and Mom

424
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.005
- wouldn't have to.
- Beth...

425
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.451
- Right?
- make her stop.

426
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.847
Rachel, he's not used to all this.

427
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.406
You're gonna have to give him
some time to decompress.

428
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.971
Why don't you help me with dinner?

429
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.287
Queens hate to cook, Mom.
Come on, Larry, please?

430
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.611
The car needs a new catalytic converter,
and foreign parts are expensive.

431
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.529
You could even teach me
how to drive my car.

432
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.165
No, it's my car, and I said no.

433
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.481
He said no, Rachel.

434
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.487
For now.

435
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.489
Come on, Larry.

436
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.840
I need my chariot.

437
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.008
- Not gonna happen.
- Fine.

438
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.481
But I at least need a smile
before I let go.

439
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.086
Mm-hmm. Come on.

440
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.361
More than that.

441
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.211
Get those pearly whites out there.

442
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.846
My work here is done.

443
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.883
Thank you.

444
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.321
Oh.

445
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.402
Yeah?

446
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.601
Okay.

447
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.006
Bye.

448
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.409
Your dad has to work, so he
can't have you this weekend.

449
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.882
But he wants you to know

450
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.651
that he loves you and he misses you...

451
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.081
He will talk to you soon.

452
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.645
Thank you.

453
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.964
If the lady doesn't get
anything, she can't stay.

454
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.401
I don't want crazy people in here.

455
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.284
Can you go ask her to leave?

456
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.765
You want me to?

457
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.370
I'm busy.

458
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.570
Hey.

459
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.844
Hey.

460
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.243
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

461
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.361
Excuse me.

462
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.407
Uh, my friend here would like a...

463
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.606
A coffee.

464
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.524
A French press.

465
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.648
And... a bagel.

466
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.285
With cream cheese.

467
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.004
Perfect.

468
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.804
Thank you very much.

469
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.569
Okay.

470
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.125
May I?

471
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.083
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

472
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.123
So, where are you from?

473
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.850
She paid.

474
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.283
- That would be wonderful. It's not far.
- Oh, good.

475
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.243
"Not far" is on my way.

476
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.567
- I couldn't impose.
- Oh, no, you're not.

477
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.205
It's not a problem.

478
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.171
I don't understand why having
a walk with God is so hard for me.

479
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.964
I'm so weak.

480
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.326
At school, with friends, at work.

481
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.523
Today it was like I let a wonderful flame

482
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.689
pass by me and into the hands of another.

483
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.486
Those gloves have become
the gloves of conviction to me.

484
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.444
I'm not going to miss another opportunity.

485
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.404
From now on, when I have
those little nudges inside,

486
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.330
I'm going to listen.

487
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.208
Remember, living for Jesus

488
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.130
is not always easy, but it's always right.

489
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.526
Hey, thanks for coming to Break Thru.

490
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.005
See you here next week,
same time, same place.

491
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.531
Don't forget, we have pizza in the back.

492
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.211
- Yeah!
- Pizza! Sweet!

493
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.084
You're the best, Amy.

494
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.486
See you at cell group on Wednesday?

495
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.090
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Okay. Bye.

496
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.282
Bye.

497
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.488
Have you seen him before?

498
00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.162
No. But he's not exactly the type
you'd want to take home to Mom, so...

499
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.163
- Let's go.
- I'll be right back.

500
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.004
Okay. Hurry. I want to go.

501
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.521
Hi.

502
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.727
I'm Rachel.

503
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.683
Uh...

504
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.006
Hey.

505
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.168
Uh, see you.

506
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.128
Um... I just wanted to
welcome you to Break Thru.

507
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.131
Hey.

508
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.367
You never told me your name.

509
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.488
What are you doing here?

510
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.763
Kind of rude for you
to just walk off like that.

511
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.407
I don't... really like church.

512
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.766
Why'd you come?

513
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.609
For the food.

514
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.451
Look, you should probably
go get in your daddy's car

515
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.961
- and go home.
- I don't have my own car.

516
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.724
Or my own dad at home.

517
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.251
I walked.

518
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.683
Fine. I'll walk you back, then.

519
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.643
This really isn't a place
for a girl like you.

520
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.722
- What does that mean?
- It means

521
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.120
you don't really fit in around here.

522
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.164
I don't care. Hey...

523
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.567
Can I help you?

524
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.688
No. Okay? I don't...

525
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.600
I don't need some dumb little
sister I got to look out for.

526
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.722
I've never had a big brother before.

527
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.645
Come on, you must need something.

528
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.041
You're not just gonna get rid of me.

529
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.528
I'm not leaving until you
tell me something you need.

530
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.721
Shh. Okay?

531
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.525
That's not helping.

532
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.960
What are you doing?

533
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.287
What does it look like?

534
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.364
Would you please just go?

535
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.404
I don't need a dumb big brother.

536
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.931
I'll buy it for you.

537
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.088
I just got my paycheck.
What else do you need?

538
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.371
You don't have to do this.

539
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.443
Okay? I can take care of myself.

540
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.211
I'm not so sure.

541
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.761
You can't even buy your own food.

542
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.288
It's not for me.

543
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.602
So, who's the food for?

544
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.489
My mom.

545
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.329
What's her deal?

546
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.205
Hm. She's really sick.

547
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.482
It's... it's her own fault, though.

548
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.841
She's barely eating anymore.

549
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.041
Oh.

550
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.606
She used to like pizza.

551
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.842
So, where do you live?

552
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.610
Oh, she lost the apartment
a few weeks ago,

553
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.609
so I've just been sleeping wherever.

554
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.643
Are you gonna be okay?

555
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.641
Yeah, I'll be fine.

556
00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.888
We have our cell group
at the church on Wednesday.

557
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.404
What's that? Is it,
like, prison or something?

558
00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.490
Yeah, that's totally confusing.

559
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.489
It's just a group of friends.

560
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.046
We hang out,
and we're there for each other.

561
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.130
- Yeah, that's cool.
- I want you to come.

562
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.368
No. That's-that's not for me.

563
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.527
If you don't, I'll come find you.

564
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.210
Rach!

565
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.402
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for forever.

566
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.971
Oh, crap! That's my sister.

567
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.764
Got to go.

568
00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.451
Wednesday. Don't forget.

569
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.605
Hey.

570
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.001
Nathan Ballard.

571
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.768
Good to meet you, Nate.

572
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.323
Seriously, what have you been doing?

573
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.202
Are you seriously copying
Brian's homework?

574
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.243
He's got a 2.0.

575
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.011
- Hey.
- Hey.

576
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.851
Alert. Thrift store shopper.

577
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.122
Ew. Who would wear that?

578
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.969
Nothing wrong with vintage.

579
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.082
I guess.

580
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.482
You okay, Celine?

581
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.405
Yeah, I'm fine.

582
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.529
Is there anything
I can pray for you about?

583
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.843
I will be so glad when you get
over this whole Jesus freak phase.

584
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.691
Oh, definitely don't do that with Alex.

585
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.610
I think he likes my spiritual side.

586
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.722
Trust me, it is a really big turnoff.

587
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.168
I'd get rid of all the fat,
retarded, crippled,

588
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.090
stupid, ignorant,

589
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.806
rich, worthless people of this world.

590
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.162
Yeah.

591
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.286
No one is worthy of this planet.

592
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.011
Only me and who I choose.

593
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.442
Everyone should be sent out into space,

594
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.610
and only the people I say
should be left behind.

595
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.365
Yo!

596
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.811
Look at these fartknockers!

597
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.763
What's up, four-eyes?

598
00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.726
Hey, yeah, help your buddy out, guys.

599
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.803
Good teamwork.

600
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.324
Yo, give me some.

601
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.565
Boom! Whoo!

602
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.002
If only this was Columbine.

603
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.725
Bam!

604
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.003
Maybe it could be.

605
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.649
You're sick, man.

606
00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.127
You're the one who brought it up.

607
00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.208
I wasn't serious.

608
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.169
Hey. Hey, guys.

609
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.884
Let's get started, okay?

610
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.161
I'll be right back.

611
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.809
Hey.

612
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.365
I'm right here.

613
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.210
- You scared me.
- Now you know how it feels.

614
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.924
What are you doing?

615
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.004
Oh, I'm just making sure my dumb little
sister doesn't walk these streets by herself.

616
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.244
I brought some food for you to take home.

617
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.805
Or wherever.

618
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.365
Thanks.

619
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.920
You want to come inside?

620
00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.200
No.

621
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.522
I-I don't.

622
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.890
I'll go play in traffic if you don't.

623
00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.446
It's been such a stressful week.

624
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.450
I've got this huge test
coming up in physics.

625
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.608
And I hate physics.

626
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.688
Okay, well, we will pray for that.

627
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.329
I know it's your first time, but...

628
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.727
if you want to share
about how your week has been...

629
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.320
- Yes, he does.
- No, I don't.

630
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.681
It's okay.

631
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.245
Um...

632
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.526
well...

633
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.563
my week kind of...

634
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.330
sucked.

635
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.205
It's... well, my dad's in jail,

636
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.970
and, uh...

637
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.045
my mom, sh... uh, she's a...
she's a heroin addict,

638
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.130
so she's... she's not eating anymore.

639
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.969
You know, it's, like...

640
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.209
She's staying in this house
that's full of junkies,

641
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.171
so I've been living in an alley
near here the past couple weeks.

642
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.486
And, uh...

643
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.331
it's just really hard to get a job,

644
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.489
you know, without an address.

645
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.963
Are you okay?

646
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.129
Where are you going?

647
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.083
What was I supposed to say?

648
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.166
- That's exactly what you should have said.
- No.

649
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.965
I'm not like them. And I'm...
definitely not like you.

650
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.082
How do you know?

651
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.931
You haven't even bothered
to get to know any of them.

652
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.365
Listen...

653
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.488
I get it.

654
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.043
- You've had it rough.
- Hey, Nate.

655
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.845
It's Nathan.

656
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.007
Nathan.

657
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.168
Sorry. Um...

658
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.964
it's not much, but...

659
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.525
if you want, um, you could stay
at my place until you figure things out.

660
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.085
We got a couch in the basement.

661
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.488
If that doesn't work, um, I think...
some of the other guys

662
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.001
are checking with their parents, too.

663
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.281
Thanks, man.

664
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.528
That's...

665
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.208
You can call me Nate.

666
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.163
It's cool.

667
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.651
Tony.

668
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.523
- Eric?
- Why are you still at home?

669
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.371
You're three minutes late.

670
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.960
Oh, man. I slept in.

671
00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.651
You slept in again? What,
you don't own an alarm clock?

672
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.371
I'm running late. So what?
Ride the bus, Eric.

673
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.289
I'm not gonna ride the bus
with those idiots!

674
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.243
Look, man, I'm not
your personal taxi service.

675
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.966
If you're not here
in five minutes, you're dead.

676
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.003
I know where you sleep.

677
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.966
- Hey, yo, R.J.!
- Hey.

678
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.445
- Got a date to prom yet?
- No.

679
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.607
He never asked me.

680
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.245
What?

681
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.850
- Want to bet on that?
- Shut up.

682
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.200
Mm!

683
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.084
Sorry, R.J., this is Dave.

684
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.531
Just moved here from the Springs.

685
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.721
- Hey.
- Hey.

686
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.205
You like it here so far?

687
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.004
It's all right.

688
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.009
I don't really know many people yet.

689
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.690
Why'd you move?

690
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.524
Parents separated.

691
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.730
I've been through that.

692
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.811
Mom took us up here
and we moved in with my aunt.

693
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.241
Well, they're not divorced yet.

694
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.089
Maybe there's some hope.

695
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.611
Maybe.

696
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.769
Hey, I got to run,
but if you ever want to talk,

697
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.961
let me know.

698
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.844
All right.

699
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.166
Thanks.

700
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.970
I'm going to meet with my mentor.

701
00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.122
- Ooh, zee mentor.
- The mentor.

702
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.162
Ow! Ow!

703
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.328
Get that part!

704
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.365
I just lost my date to prom.

705
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.727
I've never been in here all alone.

706
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.725
Well, I figure if we practice in here,

707
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.524
then when you audition,
it won't be such a big deal.

708
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.688
You'll be comfortable with the space.

709
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.609
Good idea.

710
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.200
Even though all the world's my stage.

711
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.885
And Alex and Rachel merely players.

712
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.767
They have their exits and their entrances.

713
00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.360
Oh, bravo.

714
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.927
You know, that's a poem read
by a depressed guy about death.

715
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.445
Or life.

716
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.767
Depending on how you look at it.

717
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.890
Step on up here, my muse. This...

718
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.765
is where it all begins.

719
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.801
You are so full of it, Jason!

720
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.651
I'm done. I'm never talking to you again!

721
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.728
I know you can do better.

722
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.650
I just don't really believe you yet.

723
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.809
It's okay. Just close your eyes, okay?

724
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.400
And imagine how she feels.

725
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.602
Okay, the passion.

726
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.802
The anger.

727
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.321
The attraction.

728
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.761
- I'm going to play practice.
- Again?

729
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.086
Honey, that's every night this week.

730
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.646
Mom, you know how important this is to me.

731
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.091
Yes, I know, but don't be late.

732
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.281
You have homework to get done.

733
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.686
And I expect you to stay up as late

734
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.643
- as you need to to get it done!
- Okay!

735
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.929
You know, my... my parents,
they weren't really there for me.

736
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.206
My dad just up and left when I was a kid.

737
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.403
My mom was left with nothing.

738
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.531
I haven't talked to him in years.

739
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.609
It leaves a hole inside, doesn't it?

740
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.485
Yeah.

741
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.085
- Whoa...
- Oh, wow.

742
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.010
Madison didn't tell me
you were that good at ballet.

743
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.485
- I have many secret talents.
- Mm.

744
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.125
I'm about to fail this geometry test.

745
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.446
Thank God I'm an artist.

746
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.482
You need a mentor?

747
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.365
Oh, only if it's you.

748
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.081
You're welcome.

749
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.406
I take complete credit for this.

750
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.760
- You look so cute together!
- What happened?

751
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.325
Tell me!

752
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.327
- I'll see you guys.
- See you.

753
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.169
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

754
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.089
How's the play going?

755
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.247
So good.

756
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.850
I think this senior guy likes me,

757
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.169
and we totally connect in so many ways.

758
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.760
Well, it better not be in every way.

759
00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.609
Don't worry, he's great.

760
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.040
Hey!

761
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.083
- Hey, don't read that!
- I want to be in the mind

762
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.641
of Rachel Joy, to know
everything about you.

763
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.364
I've pretty much told you.

764
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.845
"Oh, God, give me strength.

765
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.048
"Help me choose a path
we both know is right.

766
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.969
The path that leads to you."

767
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.923
What's that all about?

768
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.805
Just some stuff I wrote a while ago.

769
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.770
Wouldn't just call it "stuff."

770
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.531
That's really good.

771
00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.211
Don't you think it's weird
how similar our families are?

772
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.285
Yeah.

773
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.930
Yeah, we're like...

774
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.805
I think we were meant to find each other.

775
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.287
We both know the same pain.

776
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.846
Yeah.

777
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.931
But it's okay, you know,
'cause pain, it...

778
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.368
it gives us an energy that
we can channel for our art.

779
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.844
I mean, sometimes you need
the darkness to bring the light.

780
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.809
Yeah.

781
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.041
Now, use the pain!

782
00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.162
You are so full of it, Jason. I'm done.

783
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.408
I'm never talking to you again.

784
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.171
Well, that's just it.

785
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.009
We can't be done.

786
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.963
I love you.

787
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.682
Was that acting, or was it real?

788
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.404
Well, aren't they the same?

789
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.488
You were brilliant.

790
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.648
My acting or the kiss?

791
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.208
You're ready.

792
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.603
I'm Rachel Joy Scott,
and I'm auditioning for the role of Andi

793
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.087
in "The Chance of Possibility."

794
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.129
Thank you, God.

795
00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.162
Yes!

796
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.282
# I got the role, I got the role #

797
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.362
# I got the role #

798
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.403
# Got the role, got the role #

799
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.369
# Role... #

800
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.488
Hey.

801
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.762
So?

802
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.802
Yeah, I got the lead role!

803
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.291
- Oh!
- Congratulations, girl!

804
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.504
The drama queen finally has her crown.

805
00:46:19.605 --> 00:46:22.129
Hey, I heard Alex is gonna
rewrite the play for you.

806
00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.480
How'd you know?

807
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.489
He told me... how great you were.

808
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.170
He kissed me, too.

809
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.611
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

810
00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.125
You got the part and the boy.

811
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.651
Everything you wanted.
Your life is complete.

812
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.888
It's nice to be wanted for once.

813
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.809
- Yeah.
- Maddy?

814
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.968
- Thanks.
- Oh...

815
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.003
- You're a great friend.
- Don't get all mushy on me.

816
00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.963
- It's not a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

817
00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.411
- It's, like, her first one.
- So cute.

818
00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.727
- Maybe we'll go to prom together.
- Oh!

819
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.287
Easy, tiger, let's see if we can
make it past Christmas first.

820
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.368
I hate this school.

821
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.528
Yeah... me, too.

822
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.891
We'll get our revenge.

823
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.289
Kick natural selection up a few notches.

824
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.291
This is Jesus's blood shed for you.

825
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.006
Do this in remembrance of him.

826
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.726
This is Christ's body.

827
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.605
Do this in remembrance of him.

828
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.609
This is Jesus's blood shed for you.

829
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.846
Do this in...

830
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.770
- Hey.
- Hey.

831
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.365
Did you get the job?

832
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.323
Yeah.

833
00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.600
I mean, I mean, I finally had an address
I could put on that application.

834
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.171
Thanks.

835
00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.647
For everything.
I don't... know where I'd be.

836
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.127
Hey, it's what little sisters do.

837
00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.890
You want to come sit?

838
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.404
Oh, I'm staying with Clay's family
till I save up for first month's rent.

839
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.487
That's awesome.

840
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.202
I meant to ask you...
what's with the dog tags?

841
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.486
Oh.

842
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.682
These are my grandfather's.

843
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.882
He fought in World War II.

844
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.729
Were you close to your grandpa?

845
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.961
Yeah.

846
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.361
I... I mean, I lived
with him until he died.

847
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.289
He pretty much raised me as a kid.

848
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.765
Wow.

849
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.126
I love it.

850
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.890
Super vintage.

851
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.570
So, I got you something.

852
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.564
Yeah... close your eyes.

853
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.641
Huh.

854
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.127
Merry Christmas.

855
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.490
Uh, what is it?

856
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.965
It's a journal.

857
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.804
So you can write down your thoughts
or poems or songs or whatever.

858
00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.930
And then any time you have a thought
or we want to tell each other something,

859
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.768
you just put it in there
and we can trade it back and forth.

860
00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.006
All right.

861
00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.321
It's cool.

862
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.169
Uh...

863
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.566
how's the play going?

864
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.045
So good.

865
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.527
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

866
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.483
When do I get to meet Alex?

867
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.726
I don't know.

868
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.405
Sometime.

869
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.285
Uh, why don't you just
invite him to cell group?

870
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.482
I don't know if it's his thing.

871
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.847
Well, it wasn't my thing, either.

872
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.803
Uh, hey, you... thanks for this.

873
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.967
It's... cool. I mean, most people
wouldn't give a freak like me a journal.

874
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.242
I'm glad you like it.

875
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.647
I'm gonna draw a lot of pictures.

876
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.081
Good.

877
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.204
- Thank you, guys.
- Yay!

878
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.685
- Did you make a wish?
- I bet she forgot.

879
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.767
Yes, of course.

880
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.567
Happy birthday.

881
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.524
Well, this box isn't
big enough for an Acura.

882
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.647
Exactly.

883
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.366
But it is big enough for the key.

884
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.245
- Oh, my... Thank you!
- You're welcome.

885
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.811
Thanks, Mom!

886
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.570
Now, your mom and I can trust you,
right... not to do something

887
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.125
stupid or illegal with the car?

888
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.241
Yes.

889
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.481
We just want you to be safe.

890
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.523
Pinky promise.

891
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.971
That doesn't even mean anything.

892
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.570
Yes, it does.

893
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.366
Thank you.

894
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.811
You're welcome.

895
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.690
# Your eyes... #

896
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.402
You know, prom's coming up.

897
00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.443
Oh, yeah, it is.

898
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.086
What, in like two months?

899
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.804
More like a month.

900
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.809
Hmm.

901
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.564
So where do you think,
like, we are right now?

902
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.364
- In the woods?
- No.

903
00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.524
Like... like, in our relationship,
like, where do you think we are?

904
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.926
Oh.

905
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.490
Well, I don't know, I mean,
I feel like what we have is so good,

906
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.247
I-I don't want to mess it up
by putting a title on it, you know?

907
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.210
Yeah.

908
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.368
No, I like it, too.

909
00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.484
Just... sometimes it's kind of nice
to know if something's official.

910
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.846
Hmm.

911
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.042
Yeah, I just...

912
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.931
I just don't think you can always
define things with words, you know?

913
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.805
I feel like what we have
is so much stronger

914
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.605
than human constructs like language.

915
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.607
Yeah.

916
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.803
I think we should just
let it be what it is.

917
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.168
And what's that?

918
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.601
A heart connection.

919
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.521
But are we, like, exclusive?

920
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.210
I mean, I know I am.

921
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.080
No, I... I can't imagine connecting
with anyone like we have.

922
00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.405
I think I'm ready to take it
to the next level.

923
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.410
A toast.

924
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.484
To the famous actors.

925
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.245
That was so awesome you invited
those kids to Break Thru.

926
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.365
Yeah, they're good kids.

927
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.403
Saw them on the streets every day.

928
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.524
You would've done the same thing.

929
00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.449
I wish you had your own phone line.

930
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.245
Pray I won't drink this weekend.

931
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.364
I don't know how to describe it.

932
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.369
I feel numb.

933
00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.642
Distant from God.

934
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.171
I don't know why.

935
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.965
I have nothing to complain about.

936
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.730
Everything's going great.

937
00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.648
I wish you could tell me
what's going on with you,

938
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.003
'cause I want to try to make it better.

939
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.126
I'm gonna do a lot of praying for you
this week, 'cause, uh, I think you need it.

940
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.001
My passion has sunk to a new low.

941
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.650
I want more.

942
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.521
I ask for a bigger desire
of it, but it's like I'm stuck.

943
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.120
I want to tap into something higher.

944
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.846
I hope you understand what I'm saying,

945
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.485
'cause I don't know how else to say it.

946
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.169
You know, we seek
for answers in a world of lies.

947
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.807
Just don't believe
the lies Satan will tell you.

948
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.969
You feel like God's not watching.

949
00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.928
But you're number one in his sight,
'cause believe me,

950
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.044
when you're stuck and you feel
like you can't go any further,

951
00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.447
he still believes in you.

952
00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.291
Sorry, I got to go to bed now.

953
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.049
Pain, pain, go away.

954
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.931
Come again another day.

955
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.968
Because of you, I'm led astray.

956
00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.484
I'm sorry, but it wasn't mine.

957
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.803
Either way, it's not exactly legal to
drive around minors who are drinking.

958
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.166
We trusted you.

959
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.163
Mom, I wasn't drinking.

960
00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.970
Maybe you should just quit the play.

961
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.650
Mom, you can't do that.

962
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.884
We're a few days away, and that's
not fair to everybody involved.

963
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.480
You come in smelling like smoke.

964
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.807
Dana says you're not even
going to Break Thru anymore.

965
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.849
What's going on?

966
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.491
I'm fine.

967
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.046
I don't like you going to these parties.

968
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.527
That's where people are
that need light the most.

969
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.449
I'm trying to make an impact.

970
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:53.129
I think they're impacting you
more than you're impacting them.

971
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.568
I'm gonna take away your keys until
your mom says you can have them back.

972
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.648
Are you serious?

973
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.525
Guys, I didn't do anything.

974
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.611
Don't forget to recycle.

975
00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.405
Hey, stranger.

976
00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.686
Hey.

977
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.161
I... miss seeing you around.

978
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.850
I know. I'm sorry.

979
00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.566
Just been really busy
with the play and stuff.

980
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.888
- Yeah.
- But, hey, opening night's this week.

981
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.525
Are you gonna come?

982
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.846
I wouldn't miss it.

983
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.681
And I got you an Easter present.

984
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.410
Easter?

985
00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.921
- Is that not a thing?
- No.

986
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.405
But I'll take it.

987
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.126
Nate...

988
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.561
are you sure?

989
00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.286
If it weren't for you and my grandpa,

990
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.323
I don't know where I'd be.

991
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.205
You accepted me for who I am, and...

992
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.448
I want you... I want you to have them.

993
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.201
So sweet.

994
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.163
I love it.

995
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.123
Really.

996
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.122
What's up with the hemp necklace?

997
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.241
It's not really your style.

998
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.811
Alex gave it to me.

999
00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.763
Yeah, why don't you bring him around?

1000
00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.690
I just don't know where I stand
with him right now exactly.

1001
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.041
What does he say?

1002
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.165
Just that we're gonna finish the play,
and then we'll figure things out.

1003
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.285
I mean, is he kissing you
while he figures things out?

1004
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.721
Sort of.

1005
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.001
"Sort of"?

1006
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.485
But most of it's for the play.

1007
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.926
Well, is he a Christian?

1008
00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.566
He's really spiritual.

1009
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.647
I thought you said you wanted
a Christian boyfriend.

1010
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.649
He really respects my faith.

1011
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.649
He just believes in a lot
of things right now.

1012
00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.761
I don't know why you
mess around with that guy.

1013
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.490
You know, out of all people,
I didn't think you would judge him.

1014
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.364
I'm-I'm not judging. I'm just...

1015
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.086
Uh, Rachel, I think you're being stupid.

1016
00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.528
You know, I thought I could
talk to you about this.

1017
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.971
Well, you can.

1018
00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.722
For the first time,
someone really wants me.

1019
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.731
He makes me feel like I am somebody.

1020
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.885
Rach, I think you really
deserve someone better.

1021
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.002
He is better.

1022
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.729
Places, everyone.

1023
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.126
What if we lived in a world
with endless possibilities?

1024
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.050
But is that even possible?

1025
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.084
- Gosh, Andi, don't be so impossible.
- I'm not!

1026
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.565
I'm full of possibilities.

1027
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.041
I don't know what you want me to say.

1028
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.811
Why not give possibility a chance? Right?

1029
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.121
Is there still a chance
we can give this a possibility?

1030
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.683
You are so full of it, Jason! I'm done!

1031
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.768
I'm never talking to you again!

1032
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.325
But that's just it.

1033
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.965
We can't be done.

1034
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.971
I love you.

1035
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.130
Aw...

1036
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.929
- Awesome.
- Thank you, Austin.

1037
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.805
That means a lot.

1038
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.809
Hey, I'm gonna go, but you did awesome.

1039
00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.041
Bye.

1040
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.361
Hey.

1041
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.606
Hey, Rach.

1042
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.404
Uh...

1043
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.681
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1044
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.290
You...

1045
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.324
yeah, you were real good, you know?

1046
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.681
Some of those lines
were a little weird, though.

1047
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.246
- Thank you.
- Who's the critic?

1048
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.124
Nice suit.

1049
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.129
You must be Alex.

1050
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.288
Um, Alex, this is Nathan.

1051
00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.243
Alex wrote the play.

1052
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.442
So, what'd you think?

1053
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.763
I liked everything about it... except you.

1054
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.247
Let's get out of here, Rach.
We're going to Shep's.

1055
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.640
Bye, Nate.

1056
00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.006
Hey.

1057
00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.406
You better take care of her.

1058
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.650
I think Rachel can take care of herself.

1059
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.603
I don't know what she needs you for.

1060
01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.527
Nate, stop it!

1061
01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.688
What are you doing?

1062
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.250
He's like a white hat alumni,
and he can't even dress himself.

1063
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.489
I'm so sorry. I...
I've never seen him like that.

1064
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.968
I'm not gonna let any negative
energy intrude tonight.

1065
01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.969
It's time to celebrate.

1066
01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.402
Let's party, guys!

1067
01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.526
Now that the play's over, I really
want to figure things out with Alex.

1068
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.405
What's there to figure out?
You guys are a thing.

1069
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.845
It doesn't totally feel like it.

1070
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.806
You missed a button.

1071
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.648
Celine, I...

1072
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.004
I worry about you
with always having a new...

1073
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.571
What?

1074
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.160
Leave me alone. I'm just having fun.

1075
01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.408
You should have some fun, too.

1076
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.484
Okay.

1077
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.810
Oh, hey-hey, look who we have here.

1078
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.803
You know, Madison might have been
the best ballet dancer in the fourth grade,

1079
01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.922
but Rachel is by far the best actress

1080
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.442
- in the school.
- Alex, you're such a spaz.

1081
01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.090
We produced a hit play!

1082
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.529
You look ravishing tonight.

1083
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.167
Part of me is glad the play's over.

1084
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.286
It's loud. Do you want to...
go somewhere we can be alone?

1085
01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.962
- I can't do this.
- It's okay. Just trust me.

1086
01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.445
There's dog food in here.

1087
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.847
We can go somewhere else.

1088
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.169
No. That's not what I'm saying.

1089
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.648
Well, I thought you wanted
to take it to the next level.

1090
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.643
No, not like this.

1091
01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.603
I meant a commitment.

1092
01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.610
I don't even know what we are.

1093
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.484
You don't?

1094
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.887
After all that we've felt together?

1095
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.291
I mean...

1096
01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.731
just...

1097
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.810
be in the moment
and go with those feelings.

1098
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.045
Trust me, I... I want what you want.

1099
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.491
I'm not so sure.

1100
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.887
- I need some space.
- Rachel...

1101
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.570
Have you seen Alex?

1102
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.011
I thought he was with you.

1103
01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.724
No, we were making out...

1104
01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.762
TMI, girl.

1105
01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.211
I think you should just chill.

1106
01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.482
No, I have to find him
before things get weird.

1107
01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.531
Madison?

1108
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.563
- Rach...
- What?

1109
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.569
- It just happened.
- How could you do that?

1110
01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.205
You were being kind of high-maintenance.

1111
01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.051
I just wanted to explain...

1112
01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.243
why I left and...

1113
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.044
what I believe in and...

1114
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.491
I don't really respond
to limitations, Rachel.

1115
01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.322
I told you that this Jesus
freak thing would be an issue.

1116
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.568
Wait, are you...? Are you, like, a...

1117
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.284
serious Christian?

1118
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.767
What, you didn't know that?

1119
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.607
Looks like you needed a better boyfriend.

1120
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.882
He wasn't my boyfriend.

1121
01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.407
Then you needed a better mentor.

1122
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.967
You don't like me much, do you?

1123
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.529
People like you are just
intolerant, self-righteous hypocrites.

1124
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.089
That's a pretty intolerant stereotype
to put on millions of Christians.

1125
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:02.046
God's just some outdated
cultural construct.

1126
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.763
How can you really believe in some being
up in the sky that you can't even see?

1127
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.963
Sometimes you have to see with your heart.

1128
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.002
Is this when you try and convert me?

1129
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.009
I'm not like that.

1130
01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.007
I just want to live my life for Jesus

1131
01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.766
and let people take
whatever they want from that.

1132
01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.124
That's cool.

1133
01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.527
You sound more like
a Buddhist than a Christian.

1134
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.163
Maybe you should get to know one.

1135
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.086
It's second period.

1136
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.487
Where's Celine going?

1137
01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.768
I don't know.

1138
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.006
She's a big girl.

1139
01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.121
Who cares?

1140
01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.924
I care.

1141
01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.689
What do you want?

1142
01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.290
Why aren't you at school?

1143
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.811
Just didn't feel like it.

1144
01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.524
What are you... my parole officer?

1145
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.846
No.

1146
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.246
Celine, I just wanted to talk.

1147
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.726
Who is that?

1148
01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.009
Look, now's not the best time, okay?

1149
01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.360
I'll call you later.

1150
01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.644
Celine... I am sick of ignoring it all
and pretending like

1151
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.211
everything's okay with you.

1152
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.970
Oh, please, Little Miss Perfect.

1153
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.845
How could you possibly understand?

1154
01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.247
I know what it's like to be in pain.

1155
01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.725
You don't know anything.

1156
01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.171
You think you make a difference here?

1157
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.566
Well, you don't.

1158
01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.205
Celine, I'm not trying to fix anything.

1159
01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.727
You change nothing.

1160
01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.846
Nate, I wish you were here right now.

1161
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.002
I wish I could be numb to the pain,

1162
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.250
instead of numb to God
and you and everyone else.

1163
01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.523
I feel like I'm fading away.

1164
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.530
Like I'm beyond repair.

1165
01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.524
I don't even want
to live through the night.

1166
01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.684
Things are coming at me

1167
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.043
from all different directions,
and they can't be blocked.

1168
01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.528
There's nothing you can say or do to help.

1169
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.927
I know that's hard to hear.

1170
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.645
I put this face on as a strong
Christian to everyone but you.

1171
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.762
But I'm not like that on the inside.

1172
01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.928
I'm just not as strong as you.

1173
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.886
Words don't seem to help anymore.

1174
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.490
Maybe we shouldn't write.

1175
01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.090
I'm worthless.

1176
01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.921
I make no difference.

1177
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.041
No one notices.

1178
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.208
No one understands.

1179
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.164
No one cares.

1180
01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.531
Not even God.

1181
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.203
I'm drowning in my own wake of despair.

1182
01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.006
Choking, my hands
are wrapped around my neck.

1183
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.809
I'm dying.

1184
01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.049
Quickly my soul leaves.

1185
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.561
It isn't suicide.

1186
01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.923
I consider it homicide.

1187
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.090
The world you have created
has led to my death.

1188
01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.966
Hey.

1189
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.765
Hey, no, I'm-I'm so sorry.

1190
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.882
I don't... I don't know
what's gotten into me lately.

1191
01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.563
You know, and I... I did not mean
to lose it on that guy, just, I... I was

1192
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.091
really just trying to look out for you.

1193
01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.725
No, no... You were right.

1194
01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.962
I should've listened to you.

1195
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.121
Are you okay?

1196
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.209
You kind of saved my life today.

1197
01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.401
I did?

1198
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.046
Yeah.

1199
01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.804
I wasn't in a good place,
and I just wanted it all to end.

1200
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.082
And I thought it was the only way out.

1201
01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.931
But then I saw your dog tags.

1202
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.965
And I was like, "If-if I die,
he's gonna think it's all his fault."

1203
01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.960
And I didn't want you going through life
thinking it had been all your fault.

1204
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.082
'Cause that fight we had.

1205
01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.208
Okay, you...

1206
01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.891
I'm-I'm glad you're here.

1207
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.804
Me, too.

1208
01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.485
If you need to talk, you know,
you can... you can talk to me.

1209
01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.601
I miss my big brother.

1210
01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.485
Do you want to go inside? I mean,

1211
01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.086
everyone's gonna be
really excited to see you.

1212
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.601
- Okay.
- Okay?

1213
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.969
Dear Heavenly Father, Lord,
we just thank you right now.

1214
01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.684
God, we just ask for your...

1215
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.928
for your strength over Rachel, Lord.

1216
01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.088
We just want her to feel
your presence, Lord,

1217
01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.526
and experience some peace.

1218
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.246
God, I just thank you for loving her...

1219
01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.289
I am not going to apologize

1220
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.528
for speaking the name of Jesus.

1221
01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.122
And I'm not going to hide the light
that God has put in me.

1222
01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.487
If I have to sacrifice everything...

1223
01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.122
...I will.

1224
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.208
I will take it.

1225
01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.802
I lost most of my friends at school.

1226
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.490
That's kind of weird.

1227
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.250
She's spending time
with Jesus or whatever.

1228
01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.765
What does that even mean?

1229
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.929
Now that I've begun to walk
my talk, they make fun of me.

1230
01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.290
But you know what?

1231
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.721
It's all worth it to me.

1232
01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.088
So, how's everything else going with you?

1233
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.530
You know, being betrayed
by your best friend sucks.

1234
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.445
But the worst part was that he
didn't know I was a Christian.

1235
01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.682
Rach, you just got to be you.

1236
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.404
I know.

1237
01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.324
I wasn't being real.

1238
01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.323
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

1239
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.444
Check this out.

1240
01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.490
Okay.

1241
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.286
So, you're not gonna be a...

1242
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.849
beer-chuggin', pot-trippin',
cigar-puffin', drug-dealin' Christian?

1243
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.161
- No, I'm a God-lovin'...
- Huh?

1244
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.325
Satan-slammin', Jesus-freakin',
world-changin' Christian.

1245
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.647
Warrior for Christ.

1246
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.609
Oh, that's-that's tight.

1247
01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.606
Well, people aren't gonna
accept us for our faith.

1248
01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.125
But it's okay.

1249
01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.890
We have to love and serve them anyways.

1250
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.083
And I'm talking compassion, forgiveness.

1251
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.771
I mean, if we don't,
what's gonna attract them to God?

1252
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.886
So...

1253
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.525
what about Madison?

1254
01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.049
Well, maybe not her.

1255
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.491
Come on, Rach!

1256
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.684
Oh, the angry ex is coming over.

1257
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.365
Madison, can we talk?

1258
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.050
What for?

1259
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.642
Oh, my gosh.
Would you look at her clothes?

1260
01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.524
Talk about your thrift store special.

1261
01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.529
Like, someone else's B.O. is in that.

1262
01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.881
Madison, when can we talk?

1263
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.731
I don't see any real reason to, Rachel.

1264
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.330
It is what it is.

1265
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.250
I can't help what happened, so...

1266
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.647
just... go, all right?

1267
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.528
Hey. I'm Rachel.

1268
01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.284
Wow.

1269
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.525
Is that vintage?

1270
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.324
Looks great on you.

1271
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.204
It's a little too pastel for my taste.

1272
01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.446
Hi. I'm Celine.

1273
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.961
Reagan.

1274
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.367
Hey, Rach, look, about the other day,

1275
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.211
it's just my mom and her drunk boyfriend.

1276
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.527
They're all messed up.

1277
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.120
I just didn't want anyone to know.

1278
01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.767
Celine, I wouldn't tell anybody.

1279
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.360
I just worry about you.

1280
01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.160
Why? I'm, like, the most perfect kid.

1281
01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.001
You know, my mom would
totally let you stay with us.

1282
01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.562
We should probably stop ignoring her.

1283
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.483
It's gonna be like Oklahoma City,
the L.A. riots and World War II

1284
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.887
- all mixed into one.
- Yeah.

1285
01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.769
Like a video game.

1286
01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.922
I-I want to leave a lasting
impression on this stupid world.

1287
01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.202
- Start a chain reaction.
- Yeah.

1288
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.361
- Boom!
- Bah!

1289
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.651
I've always been drawn to hands.

1290
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.526
I think it's because it's
the way that we touch people.

1291
01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.210
Compassion is the greatest form
of love that humans have to offer.

1292
01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.840
I have this theory that if one person

1293
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.884
can go out of their way
to show compassion,

1294
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.162
it could start a chain reaction.

1295
01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.687
How do you know that trust and beauty

1296
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.202
and compassion won't make the
world a better place to be in?

1297
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.369
Tomorrow's not a promise...

1298
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.845
but it's a chance.

1299
01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.486
You just might start a chain reaction.

1300
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.962
And what's behind all of this is my faith.

1301
01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.969
I'm a Christian.

1302
01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.721
And... I'm not trying to be weird,

1303
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.207
or convert anybody or anything like that.

1304
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.689
I just wanted to be real with you guys
and let you know who I am.

1305
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.766
Jesus gave his life for me...

1306
01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.366
and I'll give my life to him.

1307
01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.682
Just wanted to get that out there.

1308
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.608
Thank you, Rachel.

1309
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.010
Okay, up next...

1310
01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.124
we have Eric and Dylan.

1311
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.602
Let's watch their video
on how they would change the world.

1312
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.089
Those bullies are always picking on me,

1313
01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.202
and I don't like it.

1314
01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.690
- Can you help?
- Yeah. You know we...

1315
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.842
can't have weapons on school grounds.

1316
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.440
But if you can get them away,
we'll take them out.

1317
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.370
For $2,000, we'll get rid of them.

1318
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.369
Permanently.

1319
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.489
Do we have to watch this?

1320
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.685
No, we don't.

1321
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.610
Okay, I think we've seen enough.

1322
01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.008
That... would make the world
a better place.

1323
01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.246
Yo. It's... it's Rachel, right?

1324
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.842
Yeah. We've only been
in class together all semester.

1325
01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.850
I know. I'm bad with names.

1326
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.803
Hey, I didn't know you were a Christian.

1327
01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.365
Now you do.

1328
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.891
Now everybody does.

1329
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:57.967
Was it too much?

1330
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.481
No. That was dope.

1331
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.042
I've been a Christian for a while now.

1332
01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.844
Just started going to FCA, though.

1333
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.803
I had no idea.

1334
01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.730
It took me a little while
to find my place around here,

1335
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.003
being the new guy and all,
but... I'm all good now.

1336
01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.606
I've been here my whole life,
and I'm still working on it.

1337
01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.929
But what you said
back there was really cool.

1338
01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.451
You inspired me.

1339
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.649
Hey.

1340
01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.009
Look out for my friend Austin
when I'm not around.

1341
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.640
All right.

1342
01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.125
Got it.

1343
01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.366
Later, Rachel.

1344
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.448
- Later.
- Ah.

1345
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.840
I remembered.

1346
01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.929
What's your problem?

1347
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.520
- What?
- I know you did that.

1348
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.484
- Did what?
- I didn't stop your stupid Jesus speech.

1349
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.285
- You think you're better than us?
- No. No,

1350
01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.609
- I'm not better than anybody.
- Oh, I know you're not.

1351
01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.966
I got to get to class.

1352
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.162
You're just like all the others.

1353
01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:09.602
Compassion. Yeah, that'll work.

1354
01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.249
So, you gonna go?

1355
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.169
Hey, R.J.

1356
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.524
So, has, uh...

1357
01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.688
Alex begged you to take him back yet?

1358
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.929
No. He's into Madison's aura now.

1359
01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.485
Well, good, because...

1360
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.727
Look, we always said that
if we never find anyone else,

1361
01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.922
then... we would go.

1362
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.082
I'd be honored.

1363
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.690
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1364
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.564
- May I have this dance, mademoiselle?
- Yes, you may.

1365
01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.011
Bethanie!

1366
01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.645
- Oh! Thanks for coming.
- I wouldn't miss

1367
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.802
- helping you get ready for prom.
- Aah!

1368
01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.809
Look at that dress!

1369
01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.002
- Oh, it's perfect!
- Let's get you ready.

1370
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.164
# Oh, oh, oh... #

1371
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.961
# Oh, oh, oh #

1372
01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.809
# Whoa, oh #

1373
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.445
# Oh, oh, oh #

1374
01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.006
# Whoa, oh #

1375
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.248
# Oh, oh, oh #

1376
01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.850
# Whoa, oh #

1377
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.327
# Whoa, oh, oh #

1378
01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.408
# Whoa, oh, oh... #

1379
01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.726
# I saw it in your eyes #

1380
01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.649
# Tonight #

1381
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.645
# The disappointment that #

1382
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.923
# You tried to hide #

1383
01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.406
# Wondering if the world you... #

1384
01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.401
So, I hear you and Kevin
are writing next year's play.

1385
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.806
Yeah.

1386
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.803
Mrs. Diaz asked us.

1387
01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.291
You'll do great.

1388
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.289
Let me know if you need any help.

1389
01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.846
Technically, I'm still your mentor.

1390
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.088
Always the generous one.

1391
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.170
Oh, look.

1392
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.362
They're playing our song.

1393
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.363
We don't have a song.

1394
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.889
I know.

1395
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.367
I wish we would have, though.

1396
01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.165
This one would have been a good one.

1397
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.608
# The night is young,
you are mine tonight... #

1398
01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.290
Hey.

1399
01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.846
I wish it didn't go down like that.

1400
01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.244
You know, I... I never meant
to be drawn to her energy.

1401
01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.646
I couldn't help it.

1402
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.564
# Sparkling, sparkling... #

1403
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.923
Well, it hurt.

1404
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.769
A lot.

1405
01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.166
I'm trying to forgive you.

1406
01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.164
I don't know, I...

1407
01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.449
I think we just view life differently.

1408
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.800
Yeah.

1409
01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.891
Although we can agree on one thing.

1410
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.048
All the world's a stage.

1411
01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.248
And the men and women merely players.

1412
01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.249
They have their entrances...

1413
01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.725
and their exits.

1414
01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.808
Bye, Alex.

1415
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.962
Let's get out of here.

1416
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.481
- All right.
- Hey, Maddy?

1417
01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.010
I miss you.

1418
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.329
# Shimmering and shining #

1419
01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.602
# Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh. #

1420
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.326
Hey, C. Having fun?

1421
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.205
How can you stand talking to her?

1422
01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.527
I would have made
a voodoo doll or something.

1423
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.684
I don't know.

1424
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.644
It's... it's hard.

1425
01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.445
But...

1426
01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.211
I think forgiveness is one of those things

1427
01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.322
that can change the world.

1428
01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.046
Always trying to change the world.

1429
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.362
I'm so tired, Rachel.

1430
01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.649
Of all of this.

1431
01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:36.603
Of my life.

1432
01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.645
I don't even know why I'm here.

1433
01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.371
Well... usually, you come to these things

1434
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.448
to make out with guys, so...

1435
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.126
I just want something like you have.

1436
01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.202
You can handle the pain.

1437
01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.168
Come over next week,
when we don't have, like,

1438
01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.647
people dancing around us...

1439
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.330
and we'll talk.

1440
01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.562
We'll talk all about it.

1441
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.041
Yeah.

1442
01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.448
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1443
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.565
But maybe I'll even do
that whole breakdown,

1444
01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.604
breakout, break dancing that you do.

1445
01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.564
- Break Thru?
- Yeah. Whatever.

1446
01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.210
Why can't I see my future?

1447
01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.803
I can't picture myself going to college...

1448
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.481
getting married.

1449
01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.602
Any of it.

1450
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.930
Nate...

1451
01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.691
if God loves me so much,

1452
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.202
why does he put me through so much pain?

1453
01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.362
I mean...

1454
01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.488
I don't know.

1455
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.809
Life's gonna be hard sometimes.

1456
01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.002
But...

1457
01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.724
he's there.

1458
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.410
You know?

1459
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.284
And, uh...

1460
01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.325
as hard as that is to grasp...

1461
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.647
he's in control.

1462
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.721
Hey, Austin.

1463
01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.447
- How's it going?
- Going to chemistry.

1464
01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.803
You want to do something this weekend?

1465
01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.002
Uh, with who?

1466
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.521
With me. We can go, like,

1467
01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.688
- see a movie or something Friday.
- We...

1468
01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.446
we go on a-a real date?

1469
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.608
Yeah. Sure.

1470
01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.603
Have you ever been on one?

1471
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.569
Oh, yeah. Lots of them.

1472
01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.370
I didn't know you were such a player.

1473
01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.766
With my mom.

1474
01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.120
Got it.

1475
01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.208
Well, sorry I'm not your mom.

1476
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.367
You're prettier.

1477
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.608
You are a player!

1478
01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.087
See you Friday, Austin.

1479
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.850
Yes!

1480
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.361
Yo, at least a nine.

1481
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.006
I hear you, bro.
Yeah, I see you. I see you.

1482
01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.650
Got that 2.0, baby!

1483
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.921
Yo.

1484
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.891
Look, I mean, you keep throwing,
you keep hitting like you do, bro...

1485
01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.451
Hey, man, just trying to be more like you.

1486
01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.005
Just make it... make it do
what it do, bro.

1487
01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.566
Hey-hey-hey, hold up. Is it...

1488
01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.286
- Andrew?
- Au-Austin.

1489
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.290
Right. Austin.

1490
01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.447
I suck with names.

1491
01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.686
Give it here, man.

1492
01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.006
Yeah.

1493
01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.407
Check this freak out.

1494
01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.927
Yo, you got a problem?

1495
01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:46.564
- Let's bounce.
- Come with?

1496
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.567
Sure.

1497
01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.967
Are you sure about this?

1498
01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.481
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- All right.

1499
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.525
- Here, buddy.
- Yeah.

1500
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.725
When the bombs blow up,
it's gonna be awesome.

1501
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.405
Boom!

1502
01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.770
The library will fall on the cafeteria,
and when they all run out,

1503
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.962
we'll be waiting outside to take 'em out.

1504
01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.969
Time for a kick start!

1505
01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.289
Finally, we are gonna make things right.

1506
01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.368
We'll be heroes.

1507
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.726
Heil Hitler.

1508
01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.524
I can hear 'em now.

1509
01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.361
If... only we would
have reached them sooner,

1510
01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.881
or-or found this tape!

1511
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.844
Oh, if only we would
have searched their rooms.

1512
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.930
If only we would have asked
the right questions!

1513
01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.683
Too late.

1514
01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.322
Am I the only one who sees?

1515
01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.889
Am I the only one who craves your glory?

1516
01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:56.248
All I want is for someone to walk
with me through these halls of tragedy.

1517
01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.360
There's something in me
that makes me want to cry...

1518
01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:07.169
...and I don't even know what it is.

1519
01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.571
Good morning.

1520
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.763
It's Tuesday, April the 20th, 1999.

1521
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.441
We have a clear, sunny spring morning
in the Denver metro.

1522
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:21.484
On this day 110 years ago,

1523
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.602
Adolf Hitler was born.

1524
01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.610
- Creepy.
- Also on this day in hist...

1525
01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.041
Rachel! You're going to be late.

1526
01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.605
- Love you, Mom. Bye.
- Mm.

1527
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.131
Craig! Come on, let's go!

1528
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.208
I love you, too.

1529
01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.205
Come on!

1530
01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.446
I'm coming.

1531
01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.045
Finally. How's your hair?

1532
01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.128
Perfect.

1533
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.250
No spots.

1534
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.402
Now we have to park
across the street again.

1535
01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.806
Sorry.

1536
01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.763
Why do you wear this anyway?

1537
01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.326
- Those white hats are bullies.
- Well, I'm not one.

1538
01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.920
I know. I just don't want
people to think you are.

1539
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:06.169
- It's just what the team wears.
- Hey. Well, think about it.

1540
01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.487
Is that what you want to be known for?

1541
01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.483
Later, lame-o.

1542
01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.808
Dylan, give me the list.

1543
01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.124
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey.

1544
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.449
Hey, um... do you think
we could talk at lunch?

1545
01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.289
Is it your parents again?

1546
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.526
Yeah. Yeah, let's talk outside.

1547
01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.170
No one will bother us out there.

1548
01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.725
Cool. Thanks.

1549
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.887
- Yeah.
- See you.

1550
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.804
And I want a cute dress.

1551
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.809
Oh, I need to get my nails redone.

1552
01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.126
- These are already chipped.
- I'll go with you.

1553
01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.287
- You want to go after school?
- Yeah.

1554
01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.885
Read this. Okay?

1555
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.480
Yeah. Okay.

1556
01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.764
What is this?

1557
01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.530
I have no idea?

1558
01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.722
Rachel, that's amazing.

1559
01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.167
What is it?

1560
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.568
Just something I was inspired to draw.

1561
01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.484
It's not finished.

1562
01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.722
It's my tears.

1563
01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.924
13 tears.

1564
01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.008
Why 13?

1565
01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.890
I don't know yet.

1566
01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.804
Rachel, I see a bright future
ahead for you.

1567
01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.167
I'm gonna make a difference in the world.

1568
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.369
Somehow.

1569
01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.925
Rachel...

1570
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.407
I have no doubt you will.

1571
01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:29.608
Hold on. Hey, Rach.

1572
01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.449
Hey.

1573
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.681
I, uh...

1574
01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.131
read your letter.

1575
01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.129
Good.

1576
01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.401
Uh...

1577
01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.010
we're going to lunch.

1578
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.600
Want to come? It's just me and Gabby.

1579
01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.405
Thanks, but I already told Dave
Rogers I'd eat with him, so...

1580
01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.522
- Do you even know him?
- No.

1581
01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.971
No, not really, but...

1582
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.731
he says he needs to talk, so...

1583
01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.251
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1584
01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.408
But hey, uh, tomorrow, maybe?

1585
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.681
- Yeah.
- Meet at lunch?

1586
01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:56.847
- Totally. Okay.
- Yeah?

1587
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.047
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

1588
01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.685
- Okay.
- See ya.

1589
01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.404
- Bye.
- Bye.

1590
01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.241
Hey.

1591
01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.203
Hey. How are you?

1592
01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.163
I'm good. You ready?

1593
01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.725
Yeah.

1594
01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.400
They're going through with the divorce.

1595
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.128
It just sucks.

1596
01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.686
Well, you know.

1597
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.165
Yeah.

1598
01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.281
It's been ten years,
and it's still tough on me.

1599
01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.880
Look who it is.

1600
01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.924
It's past the time.

1601
01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.646
It should have went off already.

1602
01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.689
Plan B.

1603
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.926
How'd you get through it?

1604
01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.361
- I don't know.
- Mm.

1605
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.448
There's no easy answer.

1606
01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.807
But I don't think that God
wastes anything.

1607
01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.288
Not even the bad stuff.

1608
01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.765
- Is this some kind of prank?
- Go! Go!

1609
01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.243
Well, Rachel...

1610
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.930
where's your God now?

1611
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.804
What would Jesus do?

1612
01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:40.090
Do you still believe in God?

1613
01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.967
You know I do.

1614
01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.648
Then go be with him.

1615
01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.530
Here at Columbine High School,

1616
01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.041
eyewitnesses say that
two gunmen came in shooting

1617
01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.403
and began working their way
through the school.

1618
01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.444
At first, many students
dismissed it as a prank,

1619
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.363
until teachers raced ahead to classrooms,
yelling for students to run.

1620
01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.921
And then he came into the cafeteria,

1621
01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.804
and you could hear, like,

1622
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.161
bombs and shotguns going off.

1623
01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.924
And then he came into the library...

1624
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.327
and he was gonna kill us
if we were of color,

1625
01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.171
and... if we had a hat.

1626
01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.521
People were getting shot all around me.

1627
01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.849
12 students and one teacher were killed,

1628
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.731
and more than 25 seriously injured

1629
01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:50.090
before the two teenage shooters
took their own lives.

1630
01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.965
To the people of the community
of Littleton...

1631
01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:58.245
I can only say tonight that the prayers
of the American people are with you.

1632
01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.811
I'm sorry, Rach.

1633
01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.810
I just wish those weren't
my last words to you.

1634
01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:50.080
If I... if I had that moment again,
I would have told you I love you.

1635
01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.170
I don't know why they killed her.

1636
01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.965
Rachel never judged.

1637
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.289
She was what a Christian ought to be.

1638
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.722
Hey, Rach.

1639
01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.925
It's me, Maddy.

1640
01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.008
I miss you.

1641
01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:48.646
And I just wanted you to know that
you taught me about forgiveness.

1642
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.442
I love you.

1643
01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.206
I think you'd find it really ironic

1644
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.210
that I'm meeting with Amy,
that cell chick leader.

1645
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.606
Thank you for never giving up on me.

1646
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.610
What, uh...

1647
01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.968
...what happened to her...

1648
01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.486
I haven't lived the best life.

1649
01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:41.571
And, uh, people always
saw me as a problem,

1650
01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.490
and I... I prayed that...

1651
01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.207
God would send me somebody to love me,

1652
01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.926
to make me feel wanted.

1653
01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.091
I just thank God for sending me an angel.

1654
01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.646
She was, and, uh...

1655
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.964
she made me feel special when I
didn't even know what that was.

1656
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.248
And, uh...

1657
01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.611
...she...

1658
01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.006
I know you're in Heaven, Rachel, and...

1659
01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.646
I want you to know that I will love you

1660
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.001
until I see you there one day.

1661
01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.081
These hands belong to Rachel Joy Scott...

1662
01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.562
And will someday touch
millions of people's hearts.
