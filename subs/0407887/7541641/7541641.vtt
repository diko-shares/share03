00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:19.468
BlLLY:
How I feel.

837
00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.554
How I feel.

838
00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:44.118
-Fuck.
-Brian, stop it.

839
00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:52.251
No. PIease. No.

840
00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:53.461
Ain't gonna hurt you.

841
00:52:53.628 --> 00:52:55.379
[GUNSHOT]

842
00:52:57.799 --> 00:52:59.133
You sit there...

843
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:01.552
...with a mass murderer.

844
00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:03.512
A mass murderer.

845
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.891
Your heart rate is jacked.

846
00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:09.685
And your hand...

847
00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:12.772
...steady.

848
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:19.445
That's one thing I figured out
about myself in prison. My hand...

849
00:53:19.613 --> 00:53:21.822
...does not shake.

850
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:24.116
Ever.

851
00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:35.127
Wake the fuck up.

852
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:39.590
There was a cop leaving
when I came in.

853
00:53:39.966 --> 00:53:41.967
How did you know he was a cop?

854
00:53:42.135 --> 00:53:46.931
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

855
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:49.266
-Do you see cops?
-That's part of what I do.

856
00:53:49.434 --> 00:53:52.645
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

857
00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:56.023
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

858
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.567
Should I?

859
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.196
So do they all come in here...

860
00:54:02.364 --> 00:54:04.615
...and cry, your cops?

861
00:54:05.117 --> 00:54:08.077
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

862
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:11.455
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons--

863
00:54:11.623 --> 00:54:13.749
Use their weapons?

864
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:15.751
Let me tell you something.

865
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.212
They signed up to use their weapons.

866
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.840
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

867
00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:23.926
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

868
00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:27.138
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

869
00:54:27.305 --> 00:54:29.098
Except for a cop on TV.

870
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:38.441
MADOLYN:
I looked at your file.

871
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:42.153
I see
that you have a record of assault.

872
00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.863
Yeah.

873
00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:46.157
MADOLYN:
So what was it like for you in jail?

874
00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:50.786
You wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

875
00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:52.788
Did something happen to you?

876
00:54:53.165 --> 00:54:54.582
No.

877
00:54:56.793 --> 00:55:01.255
-Let's do this. Come on, spread them.
-Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

878
00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:04.842
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

879
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.887
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

880
00:55:08.054 --> 00:55:10.431
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

881
00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:12.224
It's been a year. l've had enough!

882
00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:15.519
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

883
00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:18.814
-Well, l'm not them. l'm not them, okay?
-Exactly.

884
00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:21.358
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

885
00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:25.070
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

886
00:55:25.238 --> 00:55:27.281
How about
we just erase your file, huh?

887
00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:29.241
How about we erase your file...

888
00:55:29.409 --> 00:55:31.827
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

889
00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:35.247
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

890
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:39.001
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

891
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.295
-That was a joke. Come on.
-That wasn't a joke.

892
00:55:41.463 --> 00:55:43.714
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

893
00:55:43.882 --> 00:55:46.425
...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!

894
00:55:46.593 --> 00:55:49.261
QUEENAN:
Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

895
00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:53.307
-Fuck you, motherfucker!
-Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

896
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.185
For chrissake, be smart.

897
00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:59.647
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

898
00:55:59.814 --> 00:56:01.398
Come on, get in the car.

899
00:56:01.566 --> 00:56:03.943
Both of you, get in the car.

900
00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:07.905
When are you gonna take Costello?

901
00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:10.199
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

902
00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:13.661
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or l've seen him do?

903
00:56:13.828 --> 00:56:15.538
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

904
00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:18.624
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

905
00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:22.503
What are you waiting for? You want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

906
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:24.380
-That what you want?
-That'd stick.

907
00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:26.298
Will you shut up?

908
00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:28.842
We are building a case
and it takes time.

909
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.261
You know that.

910
00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:33.430
Something's wrong.

911
00:56:34.182 --> 00:56:36.016
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

912
00:56:38.019 --> 00:56:39.645
Yeah, maybe.

913
00:56:40.188 --> 00:56:42.940
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

914
00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:45.109
No bullshit.

915
00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:48.821
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

916
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.242
You serious?

917
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.202
I'm afraid so.

918
00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:01.792
Have you heard anything like that?

919
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.627
Jesus Christ.

920
00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:07.673
Hang tight for me, kid.

921
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:09.633
Just a little while longer.

922
00:57:09.801 --> 00:57:12.094
We are this close:

923
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.889
All right?

924
00:57:17.183 --> 00:57:18.934
MADOLYN:
What do you expect coming in here?

925
00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.895
-I have to come here.
-I know you have to come here.

926
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.024
But now that you're here...

927
00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.067
...what do you want?

928
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:28.902
You want the truth?

929
00:57:31.197 --> 00:57:32.781
Valium.

930
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:36.243
If you lied, you would have an easier
time getting what you wanted.

931
00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:39.830
-What's that say about what you do?
-We should have a few more meetings...

932
00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:43.709
-...before we talk about prescriptions.
-Look, I'm having panic attacks.

933
00:57:43.877 --> 00:57:46.295
Other night,
I thought I was having a heart attack.

934
00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:48.213
I puked in a barrel on the way over.

935
00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:49.965
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

936
00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:51.675
-Is that true?
-Yeah, that's true.

937
00:57:51.843 --> 00:57:54.553
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

938
00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:56.555
...and you're gonna close my file?

939
00:57:56.723 --> 00:58:00.351
-I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I--
-I thought I was supposed to tell...

940
00:58:00.518 --> 00:58:03.103
-...the truth here, if only fucking here.
-You are! Yes.

941
00:58:03.271 --> 00:58:07.399
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

942
00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:08.609
...and what do you do?

943
00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:12.821
What do you do? You send him off on
the street to score smack? ls that what?

944
00:58:13.365 --> 00:58:15.741
You're fucking ridiculous.

945
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.292
Two pills?

946
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:28.337
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

947
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:30.673
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

948
00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.842
-We done with this psychiatry bullshit?
-You can leave!

949
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.428
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

950
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:41.016
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

951
00:58:42.394 --> 00:58:44.019
Fuck.

952
00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:55.406
MADOLYN: Why is the last patient
of the day always the hardest one?

953
00:58:55.573 --> 00:58:57.366
BlLLY:
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

954
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.451
-It's not supernatural.
-Listen.

955
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:04.707
Listen. l'm not just somebody that
you have to see or they put you in jail.

956
00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:07.751
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

957
00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:11.338
What's this?

958
00:59:11.798 --> 00:59:14.633
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

959
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:16.385
Yeah?

960
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:18.178
Is it enough to commit suicide?

961
00:59:18.763 --> 00:59:21.265
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

962
00:59:21.433 --> 00:59:23.600
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

963
00:59:23.768 --> 00:59:27.479
Because according to my standards, you
fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

964
00:59:27.647 --> 00:59:31.316
You know, and too damn bad if
you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

965
00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:32.735
Thank you.

966
00:59:33.987 --> 00:59:36.530
I'm transferring you
to another counselor.

967
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.699
-Good.
-Okay.

968
00:59:40.326 --> 00:59:42.453
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

969
00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:52.171
ELLERBY: Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

970
00:59:52.338 --> 00:59:53.672
Come on in.

971
00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:58.802
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

972
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.554
Yes, those.

973
01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:04.475
I don't know what they are, you
don't know. Who gives a fuck? Cash.

974
01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:07.186
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

975
01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.605
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

976
01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:13.358
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

977
01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:15.402
-You guys know anything about this?
-No.

978
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.655
Sullivan's team will lD the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

979
01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:20.199
Our unit will not take action.

980
01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:24.703
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

981
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.039
...verifies the transaction.
Are we clear?

982
01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:31.210
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

983
01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:34.963
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

984
01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.674
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

985
01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:40.594
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

986
01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:43.096
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

987
01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:45.307
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

988
01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:50.062
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One
of those fitness freaks? Fuck yourself.

989
01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.856
[PHONE RINGING]

990
01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:57.277
-Hi, Dad?
-Yes.

991
01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.613
Yeah, something big came up at work.

992
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:02.282
-I'm not gonna be home for supper.
-Too bad.

993
01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:05.035
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

994
01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:08.705
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

995
01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:11.041
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

996
01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.339
So we'll just-- I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

997
01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:20.008
Your mother will be proud.

998
01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.052
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

999
01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.847
The readiness is all.

1000
01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:29.476
You know the players. Call the game.

1001
01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.437
Thank you.

1002
01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.607
