00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.545
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:40.938 --> 00:00:46.121
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:51.365
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:55.969
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.323
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.595
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:06.021
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:07.363
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.952
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:16.258
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:20.386
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.719
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:27.973
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:30.178
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:32.167
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:56.357
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.910
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.092
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:07.264
You should be proud.

20
00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:22.014
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:39.399
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:44.355
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:48.706
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:51.327
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:55.871
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.581
You do good in school?

27
00:03:00.744 --> 00:03:04.518
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.167
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:12.067
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:21.438
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:24.193
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.919
Good.

33
00:03:26.087 --> 00:03:28.508
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:34.209
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:36.284
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:39.455
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:41.826
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.445
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:47.964
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:50.207
A man makes his own way.

41
00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.902
No one gives it to you.

42
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.859
You have to take it.

43
00:03:55.782 --> 00:03:58.116
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.642
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.392
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:07.170
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:11.171
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.245
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:26.435
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:29.762
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:33.057
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:37.564
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:40.384
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:40.549 --> 00:04:43.964
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:04:45.798 --> 00:04:47.936
...what's the difference?

56
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:52.706
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:55.872
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:04:56.037 --> 00:04:58.623
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.756
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:05.405
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:08.322
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:08.485 --> 00:05:11.519
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:12.764
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:16.228
<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.804
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:29.466
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:29.636 --> 00:05:33.281
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:36.990
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:39.833
Pencils.

70
00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:46.590
Begin.

71
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.929
What are you looking at?

72
00:05:58.596 --> 00:05:59.970
Forget it.

73
00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:03.612
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:06.372 --> 00:06:09.633
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:11.517
They are.

76
00:06:11.684 --> 00:06:15.099
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:20.483
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:23.360
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:24.505
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.945
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:29.562
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:32.863
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:36.383
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:36.547 --> 00:06:39.515
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:06:39.683 --> 00:06:43.295
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:48.609
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.626
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:06:50.787 --> 00:06:53.754
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:07.387
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:07.554 --> 00:07:11.166
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:19.682 --> 00:07:21.657
School's out.

92
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.218
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:26.935
You earned it.

94
00:07:27.106 --> 00:07:30.041
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:33.590
All right.

96
00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:35.223
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:35.394 --> 00:07:37.216
<i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

98
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.417
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:42.171
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.646
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:46.111
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:07:46.274 --> 00:07:49.209
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:52.411
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:02.977 --> 00:08:05.759
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:09.270
- ... to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.191
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:12.353 --> 00:08:16.029
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:17.856 --> 00:08:20.507
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:20.673 --> 00:08:22.582
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:24.097 --> 00:08:26.617
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:29.054
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:08:35.104 --> 00:08:38.072
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:42.678
You can go in there now.

114
00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:50.265
You can sit.

115
00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:56.670
So...

116
00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:00.446
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:02.624 --> 00:09:05.209
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:05.408 --> 00:09:07.001
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:07.168 --> 00:09:09.557
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:10.144 --> 00:09:13.493
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:13.664 --> 00:09:15.125
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:17.238
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:17.408 --> 00:09:19.709
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:19.872 --> 00:09:22.686
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:27.126
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:29.717
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:36.254
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:40.538
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:09:40.703 --> 00:09:44.281
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:09:46.463 --> 00:09:48.219
That's right.

131
00:09:48.703 --> 00:09:50.677
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:52.985
Closed casket?

133
00:09:54.591 --> 00:09:56.282
That's right.

134
00:09:56.831 --> 00:09:58.719
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:01.879
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:04.348
...you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:10.046
I got a question.

138
00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:12.181
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:23.038 --> 00:10:25.046
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:31.192
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:35.965
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:39.927
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:43.093
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:10:43.262 --> 00:10:45.815
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:10:46.301 --> 00:10:50.524
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:52.696
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:10:52.862 --> 00:10:55.579
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:10:57.725 --> 00:11:00.376
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:03.771
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:03.933 --> 00:11:06.835
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:07.006 --> 00:11:10.202
- ... from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:12.056
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:19.098
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:22.676
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:25.812
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:30.072
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:11:30.237 --> 00:11:32.212
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.999
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:37.815
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:40.054
And we will do it.

161
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.537
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:45.909
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:11:46.076 --> 00:11:48.051
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:50.071
Last known photograph.

165
00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:53.555
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:11:53.724 --> 00:11:57.107
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:11:57.277 --> 00:11:59.862
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:02.035
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:02.204 --> 00:12:06.001
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:06.172 --> 00:12:08.791
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:11.029
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:14.196
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:14.364 --> 00:12:16.055
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:16.252 --> 00:12:18.423
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:18.588 --> 00:12:21.435
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:23.962
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:12:24.123 --> 00:12:26.490
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.361
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:33.306
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:35.671
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:39.545
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:41.846
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:12:42.523 --> 00:12:44.825
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:48.118
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:12:48.283 --> 00:12:51.130
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:53.680
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:57.461
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:12:57.979 --> 00:13:00.400
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:03.670
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:03.835 --> 00:13:06.682
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:10.192
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:10.363 --> 00:13:15.218
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:16.187 --> 00:13:19.536
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:22.227
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:26.511
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:13:29.498 --> 00:13:31.637
We have a question.

197
00:13:32.763 --> 00:13:37.235
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:13:37.402 --> 00:13:38.646
It's an honest question.

199
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.323
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.010
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:47.861
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:13:48.026 --> 00:13:50.198
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:51.409
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:13:51.578 --> 00:13:53.465
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:13:53.626 --> 00:13:54.935
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:13:55.098 --> 00:13:58.393
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:13:58.553 --> 00:14:00.441
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:04.945
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:05.114 --> 00:14:07.831
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:07.994 --> 00:14:10.711
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:10.874 --> 00:14:14.322
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:17.041
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:18.257
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:14:20.474 --> 00:14:24.881
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:14:26.713 --> 00:14:28.818
You don't have much family.

216
00:14:29.273 --> 00:14:31.378
I don't have any family.

217
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:40.023
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:42.999
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:14:43.161 --> 00:14:46.423
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:50.262
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:14:50.425 --> 00:14:55.214
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:14:56.185 --> 00:14:58.487
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:02.511
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.266
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:09.939
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:10.104 --> 00:15:14.676
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:15:18.712 --> 00:15:21.527
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:15:23.864 --> 00:15:27.312
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:15:27.832 --> 00:15:32.687
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:15:32.856 --> 00:15:35.376
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:15:35.544 --> 00:15:38.643
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:15:38.808 --> 00:15:42.604
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:46.039
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:15:46.1000 --> 00:15:50.578
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:15:50.744 --> 00:15:52.500
A state-police detective.

236
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.862
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:57.462
No.

238
00:15:58.359 --> 00:16:00.912
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:03.021
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:07.693
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:10.067
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:12.593
Sure.

243
00:16:13.047 --> 00:16:17.683
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:20.268
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:23.505
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:16:23.671 --> 00:16:26.737
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:16:27.895 --> 00:16:29.586
Amen.

248
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.052
So what do I do?

249
00:16:52.374 --> 00:16:56.018
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.190
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:16:58.774 --> 00:17:00.596
Tax-free.

252
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.260
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:06.422 --> 00:17:09.1000
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:11.181
Given your nature.

255
00:17:11.382 --> 00:17:14.229
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:17:14.389 --> 00:17:16.811
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:17:16.982 --> 00:17:18.607
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:17:20.022 --> 00:17:22.924
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:17:23.893 --> 00:17:25.355
We need you, pal.

260
00:17:25.526 --> 00:17:28.275
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:17:28.437 --> 00:17:32.234
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:35.601
Do it again.

263
00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:38.318
For me.

264
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:14.036
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:18:14.197 --> 00:18:16.979
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.336
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.053
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.136
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.114
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:47.145
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:18:48.148 --> 00:18:51.312
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:53.647
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:18:53.812 --> 00:18:55.951
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:18:57.715 --> 00:18:59.341
So you know.

275
00:18:59.508 --> 00:19:02.225
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.075
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:05.236 --> 00:19:08.236
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.925
My mother's dead.

279
00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:15.306
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:17.931
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:19:18.676 --> 00:19:20.977
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.227
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:27.468
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:19:29.395 --> 00:19:30.824
I got, like...

285
00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:34.312
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:37.134
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:39.852
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:43.564
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:19:45.202 --> 00:19:46.958
You know what you...

290
00:19:47.122 --> 00:19:49.359
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:53.451
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:57.361
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:19:57.523 --> 00:19:59.083
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:02.706 --> 00:20:05.521
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:20:06.034 --> 00:20:09.678
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:13.481
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.025
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:20:18.194 --> 00:20:21.577
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:20:21.778 --> 00:20:25.073
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:20:25.234 --> 00:20:28.201
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.217
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.671
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:38.150
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:39.696
This side of Worcester.

305
00:20:40.402 --> 00:20:43.435
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:20:43.602 --> 00:20:45.511
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:47.438
...concerned.

308
00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:53.232
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:20:53.393 --> 00:20:55.662
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:20:55.825 --> 00:20:58.476
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:20:58.641 --> 00:21:01.008
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:01.297 --> 00:21:03.784
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:21:03.953 --> 00:21:06.342
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:21:06.513 --> 00:21:08.400
Fucking guineas.

315
00:21:08.657 --> 00:21:10.959
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:21:12.177 --> 00:21:14.086
Cranberry juice.

317
00:21:15.729 --> 00:21:17.289
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:21:17.457 --> 00:21:20.523
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:21:21.297 --> 00:21:23.501
What, do you got your period?

320
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.871
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:21:32.817 --> 00:21:36.395
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:39.335
Do you know me?

323
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.291
No. No.

324
00:21:42.736 --> 00:21:45.485
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:47.558
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:21:47.728 --> 00:21:49.637
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:51.979
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:54.697
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:21:54.864 --> 00:21:57.766
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:22:00.463 --> 00:22:02.919
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:22:04.368 --> 00:22:07.815
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:09.863
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:22:10.032 --> 00:22:12.749
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.073
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:19.207
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:22:20.816 --> 00:22:23.914
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:22:25.743 --> 00:22:27.205
What are you drinking?

338
00:22:33.775 --> 00:22:35.815
A cranberry juice.

339
00:22:37.103 --> 00:22:39.143
What is it, your period?

340
00:22:42.063 --> 00:22:45.162
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:22:51.438 --> 00:22:53.380
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:22:54.926 --> 00:22:57.065
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:23:00.719 --> 00:23:01.995
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:03.758
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:06.733
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:23:06.895 --> 00:23:08.422
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.729
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:23:10.894 --> 00:23:13.033
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:23:13.199 --> 00:23:15.654
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:23:15.822 --> 00:23:18.157
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:23:18.318 --> 00:23:21.035
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:23:21.198 --> 00:23:24.012
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:23:24.175 --> 00:23:26.346
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.681
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:23:29.198 --> 00:23:30.605
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:23:30.766 --> 00:23:32.588
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:23:33.742 --> 00:23:36.906
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.525
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:41.865
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.746
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.665
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:23:46.829 --> 00:23:49.546
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:23:49.709 --> 00:23:52.165
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:55.148
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:57.284
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:23:57.454 --> 00:23:59.723
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:01.958
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:03.619
Southie projects.

369
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.343
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.412
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.239
- ... which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:24:11.405 --> 00:24:14.340
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:24:14.509 --> 00:24:17.575
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:22.276
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:23.819
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:24:23.981 --> 00:24:25.388
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:27.971
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:24:28.141 --> 00:24:30.508
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:32.971
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:36.428
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:40.166
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:24:40.621 --> 00:24:42.825
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:44.614
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.017
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:49.003
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:24:49.164 --> 00:24:50.724
You girls have a good day.

387
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.013
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.002
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:24:59.948 --> 00:25:02.982
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:04.807
I knew Myles.

391
00:25:04.972 --> 00:25:07.689
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:25:07.852 --> 00:25:09.925
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:12.961
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:25:13.132 --> 00:25:15.849
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.769
Allegedly.

396
00:25:18.668 --> 00:25:19.846
Allegedly.

397
00:25:20.012 --> 00:25:22.379
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.427
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:25:24.587 --> 00:25:26.562
He did something else wrong?

400
00:25:28.748 --> 00:25:31.650
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.525
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.467
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:25:39.628 --> 00:25:42.923
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:25:44.363 --> 00:25:45.770
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:25:58.955 --> 00:26:01.126
You making a house call?

406
00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:03.648
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:26:03.819 --> 00:26:07.168
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:10.851
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:26:11.018 --> 00:26:14.466
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:26:14.635 --> 00:26:18.312
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:26:18.475 --> 00:26:20.068
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:26:20.234 --> 00:26:23.551
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:26:23.722 --> 00:26:25.730
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:27.906
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:26:28.074 --> 00:26:31.074
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:26:31.242 --> 00:26:32.486
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.399
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:26:35.563 --> 00:26:38.911
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:26:39.082 --> 00:26:41.733
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:26:41.898 --> 00:26:44.451
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:26:44.618 --> 00:26:47.301
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:26:47.466 --> 00:26:52.354
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:26:52.522 --> 00:26:54.660
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:26:54.825 --> 00:26:57.727
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:26:57.898 --> 00:26:59.327
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:27:08.842 --> 00:27:12.387
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:27:12.553 --> 00:27:15.270
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:18.433
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:21.601
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:23.013
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:27:24.233 --> 00:27:25.891
Cut him here.

432
00:27:26.633 --> 00:27:28.040
Bye-bye.

433
00:27:32.105 --> 00:27:33.087
Jerk-ass!

434
00:27:33.257 --> 00:27:35.810
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:27:35.977 --> 00:27:39.359
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:42.377
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:27:42.537 --> 00:27:44.926
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.998
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:49.347
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:27:49.513 --> 00:27:52.808
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:27:52.969 --> 00:27:56.285
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:27:56.457 --> 00:27:59.773
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:02.662
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:28:02.825 --> 00:28:05.159
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.070
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:28:08.232 --> 00:28:10.370
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:28:10.536 --> 00:28:12.675
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.807
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:17.437
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:19.583
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:28:19.752 --> 00:28:22.173
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:28:31.624 --> 00:28:34.658
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:28:35.367 --> 00:28:36.512
Fuck!

454
00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:39.713
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.694
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:28:53.063 --> 00:28:56.609
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:28:56.776 --> 00:29:00.670
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:08.966
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:29:09.127 --> 00:29:10.621
Was your meal okay?

460
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.285
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:29:12.455 --> 00:29:15.716
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.914
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:25.893
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:29:26.054 --> 00:29:27.363
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:29:34.375 --> 00:29:37.058
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:29:37.222 --> 00:29:39.011
...in your office all day long?

467
00:29:39.175 --> 00:29:41.695
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:29:42.982 --> 00:29:45.251
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:29:45.414 --> 00:29:46.756
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:49.154
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.575
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:29:52.742 --> 00:29:54.084
Yeah, I do.

473
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.281
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:29:58.214 --> 00:30:00.931
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:30:04.645 --> 00:30:06.336
Don't you?

476
00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:09.828
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.364
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:30:12.038 --> 00:30:13.980
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:18.241
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:30:19.174 --> 00:30:21.410
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:30:21.573 --> 00:30:24.606
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:30:24.773 --> 00:30:26.683
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:30:26.853 --> 00:30:28.926
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:30:30.085 --> 00:30:32.125
Some people do get better.

485
00:30:35.013 --> 00:30:36.289
Fair enough.

486
00:30:36.453 --> 00:30:39.999
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:30:40.933 --> 00:30:42.111
Including the criminals?

488
00:30:42.277 --> 00:30:44.449
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:30:45.189 --> 00:30:48.189
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:52.029
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:30:52.197 --> 00:30:54.204
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:30:55.365 --> 00:30:57.187
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:30:57.733 --> 00:31:01.115
...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:31:02.373 --> 00:31:04.195
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:31:04.357 --> 00:31:08.219
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:31:10.788 --> 00:31:13.090
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:31:15.684 --> 00:31:16.960
Schuyler.

498
00:31:30.084 --> 00:31:32.287
Do you know who I am?

499
00:31:35.396 --> 00:31:36.857
No.

500
00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:44.864
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:31:54.595 --> 00:31:57.017
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:31:59.811 --> 00:32:01.404
No.

503
00:32:04.867 --> 00:32:06.755
Come with me.

504
00:32:11.107 --> 00:32:15.198
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:21.595
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:32:21.763 --> 00:32:25.473
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:32:31.266 --> 00:32:34.016
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:36.251
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:32:37.698 --> 00:32:39.040
What they're gonna do...

510
00:32:39.202 --> 00:32:42.650
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:45.721
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.192
Unless I stop them.

513
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.337
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:55.484
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:32:59.203 --> 00:33:00.926
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.294
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:06.076
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:33:06.626 --> 00:33:08.033
Shoes.

519
00:33:14.402 --> 00:33:15.831
I knew your father.

520
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.883
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:33:22.722 --> 00:33:25.569
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:29.240
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.028
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:33:32.642 --> 00:33:33.951
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:33:36.161 --> 00:33:38.583
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:33:39.841 --> 00:33:42.078
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:33:42.242 --> 00:33:44.543
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:33:44.705 --> 00:33:48.000
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:33:48.162 --> 00:33:49.950
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:33:50.113 --> 00:33:51.323
Yeah, come on.

531
00:33:51.489 --> 00:33:52.951
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:56.317
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:34:02.849 --> 00:34:06.231
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:34:07.905 --> 00:34:09.181
He's clean.

535
00:34:09.344 --> 00:34:12.476
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:34:12.641 --> 00:34:16.285
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:21.206
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:34:21.376 --> 00:34:25.500
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:34:26.209 --> 00:34:28.478
I just can't know.

540
00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.955
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:34:34.208 --> 00:34:37.175
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:34:37.696 --> 00:34:40.543
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:43.421
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.022
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:34:49.184 --> 00:34:52.184
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:55.256
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:34:55.424 --> 00:34:58.107
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:34:58.624 --> 00:35:01.373
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:06.774
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:11.479
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:35:12.288 --> 00:35:14.971
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:35:17.407 --> 00:35:20.254
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:35:25.824 --> 00:35:27.547
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:35:28.447 --> 00:35:29.854
She's on her way out.

555
00:35:30.015 --> 00:35:32.950
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:35:33.247 --> 00:35:35.386
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:37.623
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:35:37.791 --> 00:35:40.758
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:35:41.598 --> 00:35:44.119
Do you trust him?

560
00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:45.912
Well, these days...

561
00:35:46.623 --> 00:35:48.117
...who's reliable?

562
00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:50.526
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:35:51.198 --> 00:35:55.475
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:36:00.127 --> 00:36:01.850
I'm reliable.

565
00:36:02.622 --> 00:36:05.917
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:36:06.078 --> 00:36:08.631
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:36:10.495 --> 00:36:13.080
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:36:15.486 --> 00:36:16.981
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:36:18.398 --> 00:36:20.121
She wasn't.

570
00:36:22.334 --> 00:36:24.122
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:29.044
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:36:30.174 --> 00:36:32.116
Another county heard from.

573
00:36:32.286 --> 00:36:33.944
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.117
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:36:56.093 --> 00:36:59.508
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:36:59.677 --> 00:37:03.223
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.040
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:37:06.205 --> 00:37:07.612
Thanks.

579
00:37:09.501 --> 00:37:13.844
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:37:14.013 --> 00:37:15.736
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:17.111
All right, see you then.

582
00:37:21.373 --> 00:37:23.064
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:37:23.229 --> 00:37:25.946
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:37:33.757 --> 00:37:37.685
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:37:37.853 --> 00:37:39.511
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:37:39.676 --> 00:37:43.800
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:37:43.965 --> 00:37:46.070
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:37:47.324 --> 00:37:49.266
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:37:54.364 --> 00:37:56.885
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:37:57.053 --> 00:37:58.296
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:38:04.252 --> 00:38:06.194
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:38:13.596 --> 00:38:15.930
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:38:16.988 --> 00:38:19.922
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:38:22.364 --> 00:38:24.404
Lennon said:

595
00:38:25.115 --> 00:38:26.741
"I'm an artist.

596
00:38:26.908 --> 00:38:31.130
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:38:35.227 --> 00:38:36.504
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:39.798
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:38:46.971 --> 00:38:49.175
Smart-mouth.

600
00:38:50.075 --> 00:38:51.897
Too bad.

601
00:38:53.051 --> 00:38:55.255
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:38:57.082 --> 00:38:58.031
Now what?

603
00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:01.369
Choir practice.

604
00:39:02.363 --> 00:39:03.639
Choir practice...

605
00:39:08.283 --> 00:39:10.617
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:39:11.707 --> 00:39:15.318
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:39:15.515 --> 00:39:17.075
...and make something out of it.

608
00:39:17.242 --> 00:39:18.649
For instance...

609
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.112
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.312
What could I use you for?

611
00:39:26.554 --> 00:39:28.147
Get rid of this.

612
00:39:28.314 --> 00:39:29.743
French.

613
00:39:29.915 --> 00:39:32.281
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:39:32.443 --> 00:39:34.068
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:39:34.874 --> 00:39:38.037
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:39:38.202 --> 00:39:40.090
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.389
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:39:43.002 --> 00:39:44.409
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:39:45.754 --> 00:39:48.088
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:39:55.866 --> 00:39:58.516
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:39:59.289 --> 00:40:01.264
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:40:01.434 --> 00:40:03.605
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.072
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:40:06.234 --> 00:40:08.437
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:40:08.601 --> 00:40:11.351
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:40:11.513 --> 00:40:14.328
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:16.791
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:40:16.954 --> 00:40:19.125
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:40:19.289 --> 00:40:20.237
...you let us know.

630
00:40:24.057 --> 00:40:26.162
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:40:27.033 --> 00:40:28.724
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:30.798
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:40:32.025 --> 00:40:34.130
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:36.532
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:40:36.697 --> 00:40:39.763
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:40:39.929 --> 00:40:41.685
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:40:42.905 --> 00:40:44.759
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:40:46.232 --> 00:40:47.793
It's a fucking result.

639
00:40:47.961 --> 00:40:51.092
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:40:51.257 --> 00:40:54.159
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:40:56.472 --> 00:40:59.189
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:41:00.824 --> 00:41:02.384
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:05.367
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:41:05.528 --> 00:41:08.528
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:41:08.696 --> 00:41:11.957
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.542
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:41:14.712 --> 00:41:16.566
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.175
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:41:24.344 --> 00:41:25.326
Hey.

650
00:41:27.224 --> 00:41:28.468
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:41:32.472 --> 00:41:35.090
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:41:36.183 --> 00:41:37.776
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:41:37.944 --> 00:41:39.667
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:41.653
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:41:41.815 --> 00:41:44.979
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:41:45.143 --> 00:41:47.664
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:41:47.831 --> 00:41:49.839
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.429
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:41:52.631 --> 00:41:55.598
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:41:55.767 --> 00:41:58.517
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:02.737
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:42:03.511 --> 00:42:04.559
Hi, Captain.

663
00:42:04.727 --> 00:42:05.872
This crazy fuck...

664
00:42:06.039 --> 00:42:08.079
- ... knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:42:08.247 --> 00:42:10.254
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:42:10.423 --> 00:42:13.140
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:42:13.303 --> 00:42:14.513
He reached into his coat.

668
00:42:14.679 --> 00:42:16.818
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:42:16.983 --> 00:42:19.317
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:42:19.479 --> 00:42:21.454
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:23.794
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:25.235
...which is the right thing.

673
00:42:25.398 --> 00:42:27.918
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:42:28.407 --> 00:42:30.229
Bottom line...

675
00:42:30.391 --> 00:42:32.398
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:42:32.567 --> 00:42:35.316
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:42:36.918 --> 00:42:39.220
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:42:39.383 --> 00:42:41.586
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.238
No, no, not presently.

680
00:42:44.406 --> 00:42:45.780
But I'm working on that.

681
00:42:45.942 --> 00:42:47.982
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.111
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:42:52.278 --> 00:42:55.626
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:42:55.894 --> 00:42:58.577
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:42:58.741 --> 00:43:00.334
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:43:00.502 --> 00:43:03.317
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:43:03.478 --> 00:43:05.038
Good.

688
00:43:06.485 --> 00:43:08.274
Hi, Dad.

689
00:43:08.949 --> 00:43:11.120
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:43:27.957 --> 00:43:29.844
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:43:30.901 --> 00:43:32.625
You know...

692
00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:36.114
...if your father were alive...

693
00:43:36.277 --> 00:43:38.252
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:43:38.421 --> 00:43:40.592
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:43:40.757 --> 00:43:43.440
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:43:43.605 --> 00:43:45.744
And he could do it...

697
00:43:46.325 --> 00:43:50.035
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:43:54.613 --> 00:43:59.021
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:43:59.188 --> 00:44:02.537
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:44:02.708 --> 00:44:04.912
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.500
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:44:07.668 --> 00:44:12.240
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:44:14.165 --> 00:44:16.652
And I think about this.

704
00:44:22.324 --> 00:44:24.909
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:44:25.684 --> 00:44:28.466
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:44:28.628 --> 00:44:30.570
School?

707
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.118
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:44:35.284 --> 00:44:37.291
...school is out.

709
00:44:38.004 --> 00:44:40.655
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:43.598
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:44:44.755 --> 00:44:47.603
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:44:47.764 --> 00:44:50.317
You recall our chat?

713
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:52.618
Little boys...

714
00:44:53.043 --> 00:44:57.037
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.921
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:45:01.907 --> 00:45:07.025
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:45:07.187 --> 00:45:11.049
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:45:13.459 --> 00:45:16.306
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:45:16.467 --> 00:45:19.729
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:45:20.499 --> 00:45:22.572
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:45:22.738 --> 00:45:24.364
Pay them.

722
00:45:25.587 --> 00:45:28.554
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:45:35.091 --> 00:45:38.090
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:45:38.258 --> 00:45:40.527
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.545
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:45.161
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.883
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.570
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:45:51.283 --> 00:45:52.624
Beeper number.

730
00:45:53.299 --> 00:45:55.502
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.734
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:05.169
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:07.369
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:46:07.857 --> 00:46:10.825
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:46:10.993 --> 00:46:12.968
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:46:13.138 --> 00:46:14.348
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:46:14.514 --> 00:46:17.067
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:46:17.361 --> 00:46:19.466
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:46:19.633 --> 00:46:22.950
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:25.991
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:27.754
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:46:29.745 --> 00:46:32.265
I beeped you.

743
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:35.432
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:46:35.601 --> 00:46:38.863
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:46:41.937 --> 00:46:43.312
You need to call your mother...

746
00:46:43.474 --> 00:46:45.677
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:46:50.193 --> 00:46:53.576
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:46:56.721 --> 00:46:59.917
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:47:00.145 --> 00:47:03.528
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:47:05.456 --> 00:47:06.918
So make the call.

751
00:47:11.376 --> 00:47:14.693
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:47:16.049 --> 00:47:18.602
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:47:34.704 --> 00:47:39.014
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:47:39.184 --> 00:47:41.039
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:47:42.512 --> 00:47:45.327
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.419
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:47:49.584 --> 00:47:51.274
Bye.

758
00:47:51.472 --> 00:47:54.538
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:48:10.959 --> 00:48:12.137
Thank you.

760
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:14.766
So who are you?

761
00:48:14.927 --> 00:48:18.222
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:48:18.383 --> 00:48:19.976
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:48:20.143 --> 00:48:23.339
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:48:23.503 --> 00:48:26.089
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:48:26.255 --> 00:48:28.262
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:48:28.431 --> 00:48:31.660
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:48:42.318 --> 00:48:44.107
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:48:48.879 --> 00:48:51.399
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:48:57.774 --> 00:49:01.156
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:49:06.511 --> 00:49:08.365
It's actually quite common.

771
00:49:08.526 --> 00:49:10.053
I gotta go to work.

772
00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:20.649
Do you lie?

773
00:49:21.998 --> 00:49:24.387
Why? Do you?

774
00:49:24.557 --> 00:49:26.183
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:29.516
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:49:29.678 --> 00:49:31.685
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:49:31.854 --> 00:49:32.966
You lie.

778
00:49:33.262 --> 00:49:35.683
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:49:35.854 --> 00:49:37.828
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:49:38.445 --> 00:49:43.202
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:49:46.509 --> 00:49:48.419
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:49:52.141 --> 00:49:53.799
Did you?

783
00:49:53.965 --> 00:49:55.525
No.

784
00:49:57.742 --> 00:49:59.432
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:02.085
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:06.025
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:50:06.189 --> 00:50:08.011
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:29.670
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:37.547
No. Please. No.

790
00:50:37.709 --> 00:50:39.432
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:50:42.796 --> 00:50:44.073
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:50:44.236 --> 00:50:46.374
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:50:46.604 --> 00:50:48.262
A mass murderer.

794
00:50:48.428 --> 00:50:51.494
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:50:52.524 --> 00:50:54.182
And your hand...

796
00:50:55.788 --> 00:50:57.130
...steady.

797
00:50:59.436 --> 00:51:03.560
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:51:03.724 --> 00:51:05.829
...does not shake.

799
00:51:06.604 --> 00:51:08.033
Ever.

800
00:51:16.523 --> 00:51:18.563
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:51:20.939 --> 00:51:22.849
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:51:23.243 --> 00:51:25.130
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:51:25.292 --> 00:51:29.896
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:51:30.059 --> 00:51:32.131
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:51:32.299 --> 00:51:35.365
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:51:35.531 --> 00:51:38.630
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:51:39.467 --> 00:51:41.060
Should I?

808
00:51:41.355 --> 00:51:44.552
So do they all come in here...

809
00:51:44.715 --> 00:51:46.853
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:51:47.338 --> 00:51:50.186
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:51:50.347 --> 00:51:53.413
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:51:53.579 --> 00:51:55.619
Use their weapons?

813
00:51:56.138 --> 00:51:57.545
Let me tell you something.

814
00:51:57.706 --> 00:51:59.910
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:52:00.074 --> 00:52:02.441
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:52:02.602 --> 00:52:05.384
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:52:05.546 --> 00:52:08.448
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:52:08.618 --> 00:52:10.342
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:52:17.482 --> 00:52:19.305
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:52:20.874 --> 00:52:22.849
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:52:23.018 --> 00:52:24.479
Yeah.

822
00:52:24.746 --> 00:52:26.688
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:52:27.082 --> 00:52:31.141
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:52:31.306 --> 00:52:33.062
Did something happen to you?

825
00:52:33.417 --> 00:52:34.792
No.

826
00:52:36.905 --> 00:52:41.183
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:52:41.353 --> 00:52:44.615
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:52:44.778 --> 00:52:47.560
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:49.990
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:52:50.153 --> 00:52:51.680
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.850
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:52:55.018 --> 00:52:58.017
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:52:58.185 --> 00:53:00.454
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:53:00.617 --> 00:53:04.032
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:53:04.201 --> 00:53:06.143
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:53:06.313 --> 00:53:08.004
How about we erase your file...

837
00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:10.504
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:53:10.665 --> 00:53:13.764
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:53:13.929 --> 00:53:17.377
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:53:17.545 --> 00:53:19.585
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:53:19.753 --> 00:53:21.891
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:53:22.057 --> 00:53:27.207
- ... you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:53:27.369 --> 00:53:31.111
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:33.856
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:53:34.025 --> 00:53:37.189
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:53:37.353 --> 00:53:38.847
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:53:39.016 --> 00:53:41.286
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:53:43.464 --> 00:53:45.090
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:53:45.257 --> 00:53:47.297
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:53:47.464 --> 00:53:50.628
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:52.418
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:53:52.585 --> 00:53:55.399
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:53:55.561 --> 00:53:59.106
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:53:59.272 --> 00:54:00.897
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:54:01.064 --> 00:54:02.755
Will you shut up?

856
00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.189
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:54:05.352 --> 00:54:06.530
You know that.

858
00:54:07.784 --> 00:54:09.573
Something's wrong.

859
00:54:10.312 --> 00:54:12.068
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:54:13.992 --> 00:54:15.519
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:54:16.072 --> 00:54:18.690
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:54:19.112 --> 00:54:20.770
No bullshit.

863
00:54:21.287 --> 00:54:24.321
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:54:27.111 --> 00:54:28.573
You serious?

865
00:54:28.744 --> 00:54:30.467
I'm afraid so.

866
00:54:34.312 --> 00:54:36.767
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:54:36.936 --> 00:54:38.529
Jesus Christ.

868
00:54:40.647 --> 00:54:42.403
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:54:42.567 --> 00:54:44.290
Just a little while longer.

870
00:54:44.455 --> 00:54:46.659
We are this close:

871
00:54:48.647 --> 00:54:50.305
All right?

872
00:54:51.559 --> 00:54:53.217
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:54:53.383 --> 00:54:56.066
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:54:56.615 --> 00:54:59.036
But now that you're here...

875
00:54:59.303 --> 00:55:01.026
...what do you want?

876
00:55:01.415 --> 00:55:02.789
You want the truth?

877
00:55:04.998 --> 00:55:06.493
Valium.

878
00:55:06.823 --> 00:55:09.822
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:13.253
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:55:13.415 --> 00:55:16.960
- ... before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:55:17.126 --> 00:55:21.283
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:55:21.447 --> 00:55:22.973
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:55:23.142 --> 00:55:24.604
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:55:24.774 --> 00:55:27.360
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:55:27.526 --> 00:55:29.282
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:55:29.446 --> 00:55:32.926
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:55:33.094 --> 00:55:35.582
- ... the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:39.711
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:55:39.878 --> 00:55:40.827
...and what do you do?

890
00:55:40.998 --> 00:55:44.893
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:55:45.414 --> 00:55:47.683
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:56.865
Two pills?

893
00:55:57.701 --> 00:55:59.774
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:55:59.942 --> 00:56:02.014
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:56:02.182 --> 00:56:05.051
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:07.523
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:56:07.686 --> 00:56:11.941
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:56:13.253 --> 00:56:14.813
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:56:23.173 --> 00:56:25.726
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:56:25.893 --> 00:56:27.616
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:56:27.781 --> 00:56:29.603
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:56:29.765 --> 00:56:34.654
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:56:34.821 --> 00:56:37.571
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:56:39.524 --> 00:56:41.019
What's this?

905
00:56:41.477 --> 00:56:44.194
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:56:44.357 --> 00:56:45.851
Yeah?

907
00:56:46.021 --> 00:56:47.581
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:56:48.133 --> 00:56:50.521
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:56:50.692 --> 00:56:52.765
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:56:52.932 --> 00:56:56.511
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:56:56.676 --> 00:57:00.157
You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:57:00.325 --> 00:57:01.535
Thank you.

913
00:57:02.724 --> 00:57:05.179
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:57:05.348 --> 00:57:07.257
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:57:08.836 --> 00:57:10.843
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:57:17.412 --> 00:57:20.162
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:57:20.324 --> 00:57:21.633
Come on in.

918
00:57:22.692 --> 00:57:26.521
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:57:26.692 --> 00:57:28.219
Yes, those.

920
00:57:28.387 --> 00:57:31.966
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
00:57:32.131 --> 00:57:34.553
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
00:57:34.724 --> 00:57:36.895
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
00:57:37.092 --> 00:57:40.507
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
00:57:40.675 --> 00:57:42.464
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
00:57:42.628 --> 00:57:45.563
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:47.040
Our unit will not take action.

927
00:57:47.651 --> 00:57:51.361
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
00:57:51.523 --> 00:57:53.628
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
00:57:53.795 --> 00:57:57.592
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
00:57:58.403 --> 00:58:01.218
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
00:58:01.379 --> 00:58:03.800
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
00:58:03.971 --> 00:58:06.622
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
00:58:06.787 --> 00:58:09.023
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
00:58:09.187 --> 00:58:11.129
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
00:58:11.299 --> 00:58:15.674
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
00:58:20.578 --> 00:58:22.618
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
00:58:22.787 --> 00:58:24.859
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
00:58:25.026 --> 00:58:27.415
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

939
00:58:28.227 --> 00:58:30.049
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
00:58:30.338 --> 00:58:33.567
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:35.803
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
00:58:39.138 --> 00:58:41.855
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
00:58:42.722 --> 00:58:44.413
Your mother will be proud.

944
00:58:44.578 --> 00:58:46.366
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
00:58:46.658 --> 00:58:49.047
The readiness is all.

946
00:58:49.794 --> 00:58:53.503
You know the players. Call the game.

947
00:58:55.202 --> 00:58:56.314
Thank you.

948
00:58:57.506 --> 00:58:59.361
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
00:58:59.522 --> 00:59:02.556
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
00:59:02.722 --> 00:59:05.340
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
00:59:05.506 --> 00:59:08.320
A confessional seal, these days...

952
00:59:08.481 --> 00:59:10.042
...I'm not so sure.

953
00:59:14.818 --> 00:59:17.436
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
00:59:17.858 --> 00:59:19.996
All cellphone signals
are under surveillance...

955
00:59:20.161 --> 00:59:22.812
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
00:59:25.217 --> 00:59:28.862
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
00:59:31.937 --> 00:59:33.050
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:00:06.817 --> 01:00:08.955
All right, here we go.

959
01:00:11.521 --> 01:00:13.725
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.643
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.756
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:00:24.064 --> 01:00:26.431
Time is 10:46.

963
01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.390
All right, turn off your cellphones.

964
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.430
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:00:55.264 --> 01:00:58.166
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:00:58.335 --> 01:01:00.158
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.938
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:01:03.104 --> 01:01:06.038
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:01:12.511 --> 01:01:15.031
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:01:15.423 --> 01:01:18.904
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.485
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:01:34.911 --> 01:01:37.660
Government man. Scared.

973
01:01:38.047 --> 01:01:41.592
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:01:41.759 --> 01:01:45.021
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:47.001
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:01:53.566 --> 01:01:56.414
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:01:56.574 --> 01:01:59.094
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:01:59.262 --> 01:02:02.426
Because here, in this country...

979
01:02:02.846 --> 01:02:05.267
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:02:05.438 --> 01:02:07.543
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:02:22.942 --> 01:02:27.612
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:02:27.774 --> 01:02:29.846
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.

983
01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:32.438
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:02:32.605 --> 01:02:34.907
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:36.476
Then narrow the area.

986
01:02:36.637 --> 01:02:39.092
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:02:39.262 --> 01:02:41.084
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:02:41.245 --> 01:02:44.092
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.562
The buyers are there.

990
01:03:01.085 --> 01:03:04.314
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:05.905
Not to my guy.

992
01:03:06.429 --> 01:03:09.047
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:03:09.405 --> 01:03:10.615
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:03:11.133 --> 01:03:14.133
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:03:17.149 --> 01:03:20.345
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:03:20.508 --> 01:03:24.600
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:03:29.533 --> 01:03:32.828
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:03:33.373 --> 01:03:35.031
...is one guy...

999
01:03:35.324 --> 01:03:37.299
...brings the items...

1000
01:03:37.468 --> 01:03:39.672
...and the other guy...

1001
01:03:39.964 --> 01:03:41.208
...pays him.

1002
01:03:44.796 --> 01:03:46.770
No "tickee"...

1003
01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.495
...no laundry.

1004
01:03:57.596 --> 01:03:59.603
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:17.936
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:04:19.579 --> 01:04:21.554
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:26.579
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:04:30.971 --> 01:04:33.786
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:04:39.387 --> 01:04:41.525
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:04:43.163 --> 01:04:45.301
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:04:47.546 --> 01:04:49.685
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.952
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:04:52.123 --> 01:04:55.254
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:04:55.419 --> 01:04:58.550
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:04:58.874 --> 01:05:00.979
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:05:01.146 --> 01:05:03.285
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1017
01:05:03.451 --> 01:05:06.320
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:05:06.491 --> 01:05:08.433
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:05:08.602 --> 01:05:11.123
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:05:11.291 --> 01:05:14.008
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:05:14.171 --> 01:05:15.577
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1022
01:05:15.739 --> 01:05:18.673
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:05:18.842 --> 01:05:21.875
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:05:22.042 --> 01:05:25.904
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:05:26.074 --> 01:05:29.456
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:33.903
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:05:34.074 --> 01:05:36.441
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:05:36.602 --> 01:05:38.391
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:05:38.554 --> 01:05:41.488
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1030
01:05:41.658 --> 01:05:44.625
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:05:50.394 --> 01:05:53.427
...changing your life radically.

1032
01:05:53.593 --> 01:05:55.895
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:05:56.058 --> 01:05:57.1000
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:06:00.793 --> 01:06:03.062
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:06:03.865 --> 01:06:06.385
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:06:08.985 --> 01:06:12.051
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:06:12.217 --> 01:06:13.679
Do you love him?

1038
01:06:15.769 --> 01:06:18.135
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:06:18.296 --> 01:06:19.606
It's very serious.

1040
01:06:19.769 --> 01:06:23.314
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.839
No more than I am.

1042
01:06:26.457 --> 01:06:28.366
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.123
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:33.525
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:06:33.976 --> 01:06:37.489
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.732
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:06:48.536 --> 01:06:51.765
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:06:51.928 --> 01:06:55.311
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.487
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:07:02.808 --> 01:07:04.695
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.182
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:07:07.672 --> 01:07:09.079
Yeah.

1053
01:07:10.456 --> 01:07:11.982
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:13.553
Sure.

1055
01:07:16.088 --> 01:07:18.608
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:20.848
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.710
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:24.944
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:07:25.111 --> 01:07:26.638
We might have company.

1060
01:07:26.807 --> 01:07:28.716
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:07:29.431 --> 01:07:32.693
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:07:32.856 --> 01:07:36.401
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:07:36.759 --> 01:07:37.707
Yeah?

1064
01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:40.694
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:07:40.855 --> 01:07:44.237
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:07:45.943 --> 01:07:49.172
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:07:49.911 --> 01:07:52.278
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:07:52.983 --> 01:07:55.438
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:07:55.606 --> 01:07:57.232
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:07:57.399 --> 01:07:58.806
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:07:59.063 --> 01:08:01.103
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:03.375
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:06.929
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1074
01:08:07.095 --> 01:08:09.778
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1075
01:08:10.231 --> 01:08:11.474
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:08:11.638 --> 01:08:13.100
What?

1077
01:08:13.558 --> 01:08:15.598
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:08:15.766 --> 01:08:19.595
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:08:19.766 --> 01:08:22.799
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:08:24.566 --> 01:08:25.875
Something for work.

1081
01:08:26.038 --> 01:08:29.748
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:08:29.942 --> 01:08:32.113
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:08:32.278 --> 01:08:34.799
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:36.591
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1085
01:08:36.758 --> 01:08:40.336
- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:08:40.502 --> 01:08:42.258
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:08:42.422 --> 01:08:45.684
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:08:45.846 --> 01:08:49.424
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:08:52.022 --> 01:08:53.331
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:08:53.494 --> 01:08:55.054
So earn it.

1091
01:08:55.893 --> 01:08:57.868
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:08:58.038 --> 01:08:59.860
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:02.451
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:09:02.613 --> 01:09:05.297
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:09:05.462 --> 01:09:06.509
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1096
01:09:06.678 --> 01:09:10.125
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:09:10.293 --> 01:09:11.438
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1098
01:09:11.605 --> 01:09:14.355
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:16.012
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:09:16.181 --> 01:09:19.891
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:09:20.053 --> 01:09:23.369
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1102
01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:25.396
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:09:25.557 --> 01:09:29.550
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:09:29.717 --> 01:09:32.848
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:09:33.013 --> 01:09:36.079
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:09:36.245 --> 01:09:40.588
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:09:40.756 --> 01:09:42.480
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1108
01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:44.979
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.245
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:09:47.413 --> 01:09:49.071
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1111
01:09:49.236 --> 01:09:52.269
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1112
01:09:52.436 --> 01:09:55.600
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:09:55.764 --> 01:09:58.153
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:10:04.693 --> 01:10:06.962
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:10:11.924 --> 01:10:15.273
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:18.128
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:20.844
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:10:21.012 --> 01:10:24.842
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:27.051
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:30.962
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:10:31.123 --> 01:10:33.033
You're lying to me.

1122
01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.049
Not exactly.

1123
01:10:36.212 --> 01:10:39.528
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:10:39.956 --> 01:10:42.541
Microprocessors.

1125
01:10:43.028 --> 01:10:44.205
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:47.405
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:50.768
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1128
01:10:52.403 --> 01:10:55.120
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:10:55.763 --> 01:10:58.316
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:10:58.483 --> 01:11:02.280
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:11:02.643 --> 01:11:07.215
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:11:07.379 --> 01:11:09.321
...or your life.

1133
01:11:10.259 --> 01:11:13.128
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:11:13.747 --> 01:11:15.405
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.717
All right, I will.

1136
01:11:19.327 --> 01:11:21.400
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:23.258
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:11:24.192 --> 01:11:26.264
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:11:26.432 --> 01:11:29.912
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:11:30.336 --> 01:11:32.223
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:36.092
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:11:36.352 --> 01:11:39.767
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:11:39.936 --> 01:11:44.126
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:11:51.839 --> 01:11:52.788
<i>Frankie.</i>

1145
01:11:53.695 --> 01:11:55.102
<i>Frankie!</i>

1146
01:11:55.935 --> 01:11:57.942
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1147
01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:04.315
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:12:04.479 --> 01:12:06.421
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:12:06.591 --> 01:12:09.308
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:12:09.471 --> 01:12:13.693
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:12:13.855 --> 01:12:16.243
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:12:19.551 --> 01:12:21.013
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:12:21.182 --> 01:12:23.255
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:25.277
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:12:25.918 --> 01:12:28.307
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:12:28.479 --> 01:12:32.090
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:34.423
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:38.333
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:12:39.134 --> 01:12:40.083
Fuck!

1160
01:12:40.254 --> 01:12:43.418
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:12:43.582 --> 01:12:47.379
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:49.939
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:12:50.302 --> 01:12:52.888
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:12:53.054 --> 01:12:56.021
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:59.059
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:08.408
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:13:08.573 --> 01:13:10.810
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:13:12.925 --> 01:13:15.576
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:13:15.741 --> 01:13:19.865
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:22.299
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:13:22.461 --> 01:13:26.520
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:13:27.645 --> 01:13:30.166
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:13:33.725 --> 01:13:36.954
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:43.446
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:13:43.741 --> 01:13:46.741
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:13:46.909 --> 01:13:50.138
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.729
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:13:51.901 --> 01:13:55.349
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:13:55.517 --> 01:13:57.077
Come on.

1180
01:14:31.164 --> 01:14:32.342
You want some coke?

1181
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.482
There it is.

1182
01:14:40.092 --> 01:14:42.481
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:14:56.891 --> 01:14:58.746
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:15:00.987 --> 01:15:02.743
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:15:03.419 --> 01:15:06.288
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:15:06.459 --> 01:15:08.466
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:15:08.635 --> 01:15:11.701
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:15:11.867 --> 01:15:15.642
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1189
01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.559
Then we wait here.

1190
01:15:18.363 --> 01:15:20.981
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:15:31.899 --> 01:15:33.939
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:15:37.307 --> 01:15:39.576
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:15:39.738 --> 01:15:42.291
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:15:42.778 --> 01:15:45.145
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:15:49.914 --> 01:15:51.824
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:15:51.994 --> 01:15:54.067
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:15:54.234 --> 01:15:55.444
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:56.854
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:15:57.594 --> 01:15:59.504
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:01.111
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:16:01.466 --> 01:16:03.887
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:16:04.058 --> 01:16:05.367
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:09.523
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:16:28.057 --> 01:16:29.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:33.936
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:16:40.569 --> 01:16:42.357
Look...

1207
01:16:42.521 --> 01:16:44.212
- ... if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1208
01:16:44.377 --> 01:16:46.897
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:51.512
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:16:52.249 --> 01:16:54.321
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:17:03.129 --> 01:17:04.722
That's me.

1212
01:17:07.673 --> 01:17:09.102
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:17:14.936 --> 01:17:18.482
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.182
You have to choose.

1215
01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.897
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:17:23.064 --> 01:17:26.326
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:17:26.489 --> 01:17:28.660
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:17:28.824 --> 01:17:31.312
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:17:32.216 --> 01:17:34.998
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:17:45.368 --> 01:17:50.387
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:17:55.384 --> 01:17:56.977
Is it real?

1222
01:18:00.728 --> 01:18:02.386
I think so.

1223
01:18:08.056 --> 01:18:09.844
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:18:10.007 --> 01:18:11.501
No.

1225
01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:14.130
I like that.

1226
01:19:23.478 --> 01:19:24.623
I don't get it.

1227
01:19:27.414 --> 01:19:29.934
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:19:30.102 --> 01:19:33.135
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:37.361
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:19:37.525 --> 01:19:41.519
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:19:41.686 --> 01:19:44.817
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:19:44.982 --> 01:19:48.178
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:19:48.341 --> 01:19:49.748
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:19:50.965 --> 01:19:52.754
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:19:52.917 --> 01:19:55.251
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:19:55.765 --> 01:19:58.067
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:19:58.229 --> 01:20:00.269
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:20:00.437 --> 01:20:03.220
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.934
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:09.996
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:13.107
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:20:13.525 --> 01:20:16.143
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:05.773
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.965
Yeah...

1245
01:21:14.964 --> 01:21:17.582
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:21:18.419 --> 01:21:21.321
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:21:21.491 --> 01:21:24.273
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:21:24.435 --> 01:21:28.330
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:21:28.691 --> 01:21:30.317
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.674
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:21:33.843 --> 01:21:35.665
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:21:35.827 --> 01:21:38.861
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:21:39.443 --> 01:21:41.036
I own the place.

1254
01:21:43.251 --> 01:21:45.739
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:50.605
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:21:51.283 --> 01:21:52.690
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:21:52.851 --> 01:21:55.055
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:21:55.219 --> 01:21:58.634
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:21:58.803 --> 01:22:00.329
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:22:00.914 --> 01:22:03.216
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:22:03.923 --> 01:22:07.403
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:09.545
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:22:09.714 --> 01:22:13.970
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:22:14.131 --> 01:22:15.887
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:22:16.051 --> 01:22:18.352
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:22:18.514 --> 01:22:21.067
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:22:21.234 --> 01:22:23.373
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:25.065
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:22:30.002 --> 01:22:32.685
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:34.443
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:38.057
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:42.571
Okay.

1273
01:22:46.258 --> 01:22:49.007
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:53.032
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:57.260
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:00.550
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:23:00.721 --> 01:23:05.674
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:23:05.841 --> 01:23:08.175
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:10.959
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:23:12.145 --> 01:23:16.520
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:23:16.689 --> 01:23:18.282
Right?

1282
01:23:18.449 --> 01:23:20.970
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:23:21.137 --> 01:23:25.577
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:23:31.825 --> 01:23:33.319
Christ.

1285
01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.799
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:23:38.545 --> 01:23:43.018
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:27.343
Shit!

1288
01:25:04.655 --> 01:25:06.030
Fuck.

1289
01:26:20.973 --> 01:26:22.402
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:26:22.573 --> 01:26:24.645
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:26:28.653 --> 01:26:30.442
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:26:30.605 --> 01:26:32.230
Have a good one.

1293
01:26:54.412 --> 01:26:56.485
I smell a rat.

1294
01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.038
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:27:05.068 --> 01:27:06.595
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.053
No.

1297
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.195
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:27:13.868 --> 01:27:15.177
It depends.

1299
01:27:17.292 --> 01:27:20.772
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:27:21.356 --> 01:27:24.356
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:27:25.292 --> 01:27:26.470
Cop.

1302
01:27:26.635 --> 01:27:31.687
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:27:31.852 --> 01:27:33.924
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:27:35.468 --> 01:27:37.988
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:27:39.404 --> 01:27:42.153
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:27:43.148 --> 01:27:45.003
Ex-wife.

1307
01:27:46.251 --> 01:27:48.226
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:27:49.547 --> 01:27:51.402
Or stupid.

1309
01:27:52.523 --> 01:27:55.752
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:27:55.915 --> 01:27:57.541
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:27:58.187 --> 01:28:00.009
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:28:04.075 --> 01:28:09.225
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:28:09.931 --> 01:28:12.266
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:28:12.714 --> 01:28:14.918
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:28:15.083 --> 01:28:17.091
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:28:17.866 --> 01:28:20.681
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:28:21.323 --> 01:28:24.356
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:28:26.347 --> 01:28:29.380
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:28:30.827 --> 01:28:32.769
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:28:33.482 --> 01:28:35.719
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:28:36.234 --> 01:28:38.820
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:28:39.562 --> 01:28:43.872
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:45.318
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:48.712
...I quit.

1325
01:28:49.291 --> 01:28:53.513
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:28:53.674 --> 01:28:56.489
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:29:07.177 --> 01:29:10.690
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:29:12.745 --> 01:29:16.607
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:29:17.449 --> 01:29:19.653
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:29:19.817 --> 01:29:22.054
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:29:22.218 --> 01:29:24.421
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:29:24.585 --> 01:29:28.033
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:30.241
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:34.370
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:29:34.537 --> 01:29:37.668
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:29:39.081 --> 01:29:40.837
But I like it.

1337
01:29:41.961 --> 01:29:44.612
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:29:44.777 --> 01:29:47.494
...I got this rat...

1339
01:29:47.657 --> 01:29:51.780
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:29:51.944 --> 01:29:54.246
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:29:54.409 --> 01:29:58.238
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:29:59.432 --> 01:30:01.188
Girlfriend...

1343
01:30:02.953 --> 01:30:07.622
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:10.914
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:30:11.081 --> 01:30:13.895
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:30:14.057 --> 01:30:16.740
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:30:16.904 --> 01:30:19.206
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:30:19.369 --> 01:30:21.223
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:30:21.384 --> 01:30:24.548
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:30:24.712 --> 01:30:26.054
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:30:27.112 --> 01:30:29.348
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:31.678
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:30:31.848 --> 01:30:35.231
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.407
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:30:37.576 --> 01:30:41.885
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:30:46.696 --> 01:30:48.157
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:30:48.328 --> 01:30:50.630
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:30:50.792 --> 01:30:53.639
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:30:53.799 --> 01:30:56.647
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:30:56.808 --> 01:31:00.190
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:31:00.1000 --> 01:31:05.310
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:31:06.215 --> 01:31:09.248
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:31:10.471 --> 01:31:13.766
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:31:16.168 --> 01:31:18.110
You wanna be me?

1365
01:31:21.671 --> 01:31:24.224
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:25.820
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:31:27.079 --> 01:31:30.014
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:31:30.183 --> 01:31:32.354
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:31:33.319 --> 01:31:38.053
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:39.909
Yeah.

1371
01:31:40.711 --> 01:31:43.078
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:31:43.239 --> 01:31:47.167
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:31:49.574 --> 01:31:52.324
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:31:52.487 --> 01:31:54.275
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:58.501
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:32:00.646 --> 01:32:02.882
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:32:03.814 --> 01:32:06.531
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:32:06.694 --> 01:32:09.727
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:32:13.734 --> 01:32:18.752
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:32:19.558 --> 01:32:21.729
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:32:24.006 --> 01:32:25.500
Excuse me...

1382
01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:28.223
- ... French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:29.338
...cigarette.

1384
01:32:32.198 --> 01:32:34.434
Eat something.

1385
01:32:42.725 --> 01:32:43.673
Problem?

1386
01:32:43.845 --> 01:32:47.228
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:32:47.397 --> 01:32:49.634
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:51.837
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:32:52.005 --> 01:32:55.388
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:32:55.557 --> 01:32:58.972
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:32:59.141 --> 01:33:00.089
Fucking prick.

1392
01:33:00.485 --> 01:33:03.354
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:33:03.525 --> 01:33:05.762
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:33:06.085 --> 01:33:09.281
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:33:10.021 --> 01:33:12.508
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:33:12.965 --> 01:33:16.859
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:33:18.533 --> 01:33:21.315
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:26.687
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:33:26.852 --> 01:33:29.503
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:33:29.668 --> 01:33:30.846
No.

1401
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:36.002
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:40.285
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:33:40.452 --> 01:33:42.241
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.209
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:56.060
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1406
01:33:56.260 --> 01:34:00.318
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1407
01:34:00.483 --> 01:34:05.088
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1408
01:34:06.468 --> 01:34:08.377
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1409
01:34:11.203 --> 01:34:14.302
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1410
01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:17.730
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:34:18.308 --> 01:34:20.380
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:34:21.636 --> 01:34:23.458
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:34:27.587 --> 01:34:30.304
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:34:31.491 --> 01:34:33.150
Another city.

1415
01:34:33.379 --> 01:34:35.615
Another city, huh?

1416
01:34:37.059 --> 01:34:40.058
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:34:40.579 --> 01:34:43.710
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1418
01:34:45.954 --> 01:34:47.678
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:34:47.843 --> 01:34:52.120
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:34:53.378 --> 01:34:57.535
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:35:05.955 --> 01:35:09.632
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1422
01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:29.788
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:35:29.954 --> 01:35:32.856
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:35:33.026 --> 01:35:36.157
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:35:36.322 --> 01:35:37.271
Yeah.

1426
01:35:37.441 --> 01:35:40.987
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:44.318
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:35:50.017 --> 01:35:51.904
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:35:54.369 --> 01:35:56.987
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:35:58.689 --> 01:36:00.926
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:03.293
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:36:14.337 --> 01:36:18.199
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:36:19.873 --> 01:36:24.314
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.506
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:36:29.249 --> 01:36:31.704
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:36:32.672 --> 01:36:34.680
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:36:34.848 --> 01:36:37.052
- ... and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:36:39.361 --> 01:36:40.921
You're a cop.

1439
01:36:41.376 --> 01:36:42.653
What?

1440
01:36:42.816 --> 01:36:44.856
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:36:45.856 --> 01:36:49.434
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1442
01:36:50.816 --> 01:36:53.816
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:36:53.984 --> 01:36:55.838
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.335
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:37:05.503 --> 01:37:08.569
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:37:08.735 --> 01:37:11.899
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:37:12.064 --> 01:37:13.438
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1448
01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.869
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1449
01:37:16.032 --> 01:37:19.348
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.131
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:37:24.927 --> 01:37:26.488
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:37:26.656 --> 01:37:28.346
No way, he says.

1453
01:37:40.351 --> 01:37:42.620
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:37:42.783 --> 01:37:44.245
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:37:44.415 --> 01:37:48.637
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:37:49.631 --> 01:37:51.256
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:37:53.983 --> 01:37:57.758
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:37:57.919 --> 01:37:59.741
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:37:59.903 --> 01:38:02.936
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:38:03.102 --> 01:38:06.714
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:38:06.879 --> 01:38:08.788
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:38:08.959 --> 01:38:12.341
<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1463
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:15.128
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:38:15.294 --> 01:38:17.498
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:38:20.702 --> 01:38:23.452
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:38:58.429 --> 01:38:59.607
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:38:59.774 --> 01:39:01.661
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1468
01:39:03.006 --> 01:39:05.372
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1469
01:39:05.534 --> 01:39:07.322
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:39:07.806 --> 01:39:09.147
No.

1471
01:39:10.717 --> 01:39:13.434
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:39:14.717 --> 01:39:18.197
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:39:18.365 --> 01:39:20.537
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:39:55.005 --> 01:39:58.071
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:39:58.237 --> 01:40:00.658
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:40:04.668 --> 01:40:06.228
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:13.173
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.783
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:40:18.588 --> 01:40:20.017
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:40:20.188 --> 01:40:21.267
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:40:21.436 --> 01:40:23.858
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:40:30.172 --> 01:40:32.506
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:40:33.115 --> 01:40:35.963
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:40:36.124 --> 01:40:39.506
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:40:39.676 --> 01:40:41.912
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:51.322
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:40:51.483 --> 01:40:53.109
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:40:53.275 --> 01:40:55.958
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:40:56.123 --> 01:40:59.254
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:41:00.283 --> 01:41:01.298
Yeah?

1491
01:41:01.467 --> 01:41:04.052
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:41:04.219 --> 01:41:06.456
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:41:06.619 --> 01:41:07.993
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:41:11.866 --> 01:41:12.979
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1495
01:41:13.147 --> 01:41:15.351
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:41:15.802 --> 01:41:17.712
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1497
01:41:17.882 --> 01:41:20.370
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:41:20.539 --> 01:41:21.913
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:41:22.426 --> 01:41:23.604
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:41:23.771 --> 01:41:25.297
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:41:25.466 --> 01:41:26.841
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:41:27.003 --> 01:41:29.621
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:41:30.555 --> 01:41:32.016
Come on!

1504
01:41:38.394 --> 01:41:40.761
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:41:41.819 --> 01:41:44.535
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:41:45.402 --> 01:41:47.737
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:41:47.898 --> 01:41:51.062
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1508
01:41:55.802 --> 01:41:58.519
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:42:02.426 --> 01:42:04.149
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:42:04.313 --> 01:42:06.069
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:42:06.233 --> 01:42:09.135
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:42:26.041 --> 01:42:28.496
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:42:28.665 --> 01:42:31.567
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:42:31.738 --> 01:42:33.745
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.856
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:42:51.513 --> 01:42:54.382
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:42:58.553 --> 01:43:00.495
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:43:01.272 --> 01:43:03.247
What the fuck?

1519
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.148
Fuck.

1520
01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.142
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:43:09.304 --> 01:43:11.890
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:43:20.248 --> 01:43:22.070
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:43:22.232 --> 01:43:24.883
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:43:25.464 --> 01:43:26.893
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:43:27.064 --> 01:43:28.788
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:43:28.952 --> 01:43:30.261
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:43:30.424 --> 01:43:32.017
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:43:32.184 --> 01:43:33.645
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:43:33.816 --> 01:43:36.631
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:43:36.792 --> 01:43:38.766
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:43:38.936 --> 01:43:40.976
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:43:41.144 --> 01:43:42.453
What came off the roof?

1533
01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:44.045
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:43:44.216 --> 01:43:45.906
Fuck this.

1535
01:43:53.655 --> 01:43:55.215
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:43:56.664 --> 01:43:59.478
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:43:59.639 --> 01:44:01.200
All right. I got him.

1538
01:44:07.384 --> 01:44:09.489
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:44:09.655 --> 01:44:12.917
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1540
01:44:13.079 --> 01:44:15.021
<i>Send some back...</i>

1541
01:44:31.671 --> 01:44:34.704
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:44:34.871 --> 01:44:36.627
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:38.863
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:41.648
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:44:41.814 --> 01:44:44.116
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:44:44.982 --> 01:44:46.575
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:44:46.743 --> 01:44:48.172
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:44:48.342 --> 01:44:49.651
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:44:49.814 --> 01:44:52.848
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:44:53.014 --> 01:44:55.086
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:44:55.254 --> 01:44:57.393
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:44:57.558 --> 01:45:00.819
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:45:00.982 --> 01:45:02.030
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:45:02.198 --> 01:45:05.613
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:45:05.782 --> 01:45:07.309
I need access to those files.

1556
01:45:07.478 --> 01:45:10.380
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:45:10.549 --> 01:45:12.589
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:45:12.758 --> 01:45:15.441
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:45:15.605 --> 01:45:18.355
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:45:18.518 --> 01:45:21.333
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:45:21.494 --> 01:45:23.763
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:45:23.926 --> 01:45:27.188
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:28.756
Good.

1564
01:45:30.517 --> 01:45:32.044
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:45:33.909 --> 01:45:35.665
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:37.869
You want those codes.

1567
01:45:40.854 --> 01:45:42.512
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:45:44.117 --> 01:45:46.572
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:45:46.741 --> 01:45:50.767
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:45:50.933 --> 01:45:52.340
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:45:52.917 --> 01:45:55.699
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:45:55.861 --> 01:45:57.771
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:00.842
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:46:01.013 --> 01:46:02.988
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:46:09.108 --> 01:46:10.570
Yeah?

1576
01:46:12.692 --> 01:46:14.602
Yeah?

1577
01:46:15.061 --> 01:46:17.133
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:46:18.868 --> 01:46:20.494
What's that?

1579
01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:24.777
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:46:28.116 --> 01:46:29.425
Yeah?

1581
01:46:30.421 --> 01:46:34.065
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:46:35.892 --> 01:46:38.030
When I called you...

1583
01:46:38.196 --> 01:46:40.335
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:44.144
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:46:44.308 --> 01:46:47.985
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:46:48.436 --> 01:46:50.258
...didn't you?

1587
01:46:51.476 --> 01:46:53.931
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:46:55.156 --> 01:46:56.432
Tell me why.

1589
01:47:18.387 --> 01:47:21.649
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:23.534
He's dead.

1591
01:47:23.699 --> 01:47:25.259
I'm going home.

1592
01:47:25.427 --> 01:47:28.111
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1593
01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:30.217
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:47:30.387 --> 01:47:31.794
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:47:31.955 --> 01:47:35.021
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:47:35.187 --> 01:47:37.740
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1597
01:47:37.907 --> 01:47:39.314
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1598
01:47:39.475 --> 01:47:43.369
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:47:43.538 --> 01:47:44.913
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1600
01:47:45.075 --> 01:47:48.588
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:47:48.754 --> 01:47:50.729
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1602
01:47:50.899 --> 01:47:54.412
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:47:56.018 --> 01:47:57.611
Sweetheart.

1604
01:47:57.779 --> 01:47:59.884
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:48:00.466 --> 01:48:01.808
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:48:02.290 --> 01:48:05.421
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:48:05.874 --> 01:48:07.783
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:48:07.954 --> 01:48:10.288
No. You watch it.

1609
01:48:10.962 --> 01:48:13.166
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:48:20.754 --> 01:48:23.504
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:48:26.578 --> 01:48:28.269
I know.

1612
01:48:53.585 --> 01:48:57.327
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:49:02.257 --> 01:49:04.079
I'm sorry.

1614
01:49:10.288 --> 01:49:11.947
Yeah...

1615
01:49:16.337 --> 01:49:17.897
...I know.

1616
01:51:21.262 --> 01:51:22.691
Yeah.

1617
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:26.568
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:28.484
Who are you?

1619
01:51:28.718 --> 01:51:30.890
So it is you.

1620
01:51:32.046 --> 01:51:34.916
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:37.830
Who are you?

1622
01:51:38.702 --> 01:51:40.644
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:51:40.814 --> 01:51:42.504
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:51:43.181 --> 01:51:45.123
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:51:45.294 --> 01:51:46.571
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1626
01:51:46.734 --> 01:51:49.800
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:51:49.965 --> 01:51:52.071
We're all very upset.

1628
01:51:52.685 --> 01:51:55.336
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1629
01:51:56.269 --> 01:51:59.051
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:52:00.461 --> 01:52:01.409
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1631
01:52:38.989 --> 01:52:41.193
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1632
01:52:41.357 --> 01:52:43.244
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1633
01:52:43.404 --> 01:52:46.273
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1634
01:52:46.444 --> 01:52:48.833
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1635
01:52:49.005 --> 01:52:51.852
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1636
01:52:52.012 --> 01:52:53.506
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1637
01:52:53.676 --> 01:52:55.978
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1638
01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:59.456
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:52:59.692 --> 01:53:03.008
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:05.035
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:53:05.196 --> 01:53:07.716
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:53:07.884 --> 01:53:09.956
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:53:10.124 --> 01:53:12.164
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:53:12.332 --> 01:53:14.471
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:53:14.827 --> 01:53:16.071
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:53:16.716 --> 01:53:19.269
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:53:19.435 --> 01:53:23.778
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:53:24.139 --> 01:53:26.244
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:29.028
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:53:29.195 --> 01:53:33.952
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:53:34.124 --> 01:53:36.939
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:53:37.931 --> 01:53:41.095
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:53:41.259 --> 01:53:43.266
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:53:44.011 --> 01:53:46.084
Don't laugh!

1655
01:53:46.891 --> 01:53:49.673
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:53:53.451 --> 01:53:55.142
Proceed.

1657
01:54:16.682 --> 01:54:18.089
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:54:18.250 --> 01:54:20.901
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:54:21.066 --> 01:54:24.481
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:54:24.651 --> 01:54:25.731
So get rid of them.

1661
01:54:25.898 --> 01:54:28.866
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:54:29.034 --> 01:54:31.173
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:54:35.914 --> 01:54:37.409
All right.

1664
01:54:43.466 --> 01:54:46.532
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:54:46.698 --> 01:54:49.381
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
01:55:05.033 --> 01:55:08.230
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
01:55:08.394 --> 01:55:10.663
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
01:55:10.826 --> 01:55:13.379
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
01:55:13.577 --> 01:55:14.886
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1670
01:55:15.049 --> 01:55:17.602
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
01:55:17.769 --> 01:55:20.584
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
01:55:20.777 --> 01:55:23.144
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
01:55:23.305 --> 01:55:25.378
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
01:55:25.545 --> 01:55:27.879
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
01:55:28.041 --> 01:55:30.911
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
01:55:50.441 --> 01:55:52.416
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
01:55:52.584 --> 01:55:55.072
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
01:56:18.376 --> 01:56:19.838
Load it.

1679
01:56:27.528 --> 01:56:29.732
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
01:56:30.952 --> 01:56:32.839
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
01:56:32.999 --> 01:56:35.934
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
01:56:39.015 --> 01:56:40.739
Load.

1683
01:56:48.007 --> 01:56:49.763
Go, go!

1684
01:56:52.103 --> 01:56:53.597
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
01:56:55.591 --> 01:56:57.631
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
01:56:57.799 --> 01:57:01.115
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
01:57:09.767 --> 01:57:12.102
Cocksuckers.

1688
01:57:17.862 --> 01:57:20.318
Motherfucking shit!

1689
01:57:23.622 --> 01:57:25.215
Motherfucking...!

1690
01:57:28.486 --> 01:57:30.658
Back the fuck up!

1691
01:57:30.823 --> 01:57:32.830
They fucking shot me.

1692
01:57:36.391 --> 01:57:37.471
Get down!

1693
01:57:40.358 --> 01:57:41.852
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
01:57:59.814 --> 01:58:01.221
Fuck it.

1695
01:58:39.046 --> 01:58:42.657
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
01:58:44.005 --> 01:58:46.492
You're an FBI informant?

1697
01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:48.766
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
01:58:50.181 --> 01:58:51.806
Grow up.

1699
01:58:52.485 --> 01:58:55.300
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:56.890
Do they know who I am?

1701
01:58:58.756 --> 01:59:02.946
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
01:59:03.941 --> 01:59:06.275
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
01:59:07.812 --> 01:59:09.241
Frank.

1704
01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:12.323
Frank. Frank.

1705
01:59:12.485 --> 01:59:14.394
Do they know about me?

1706
01:59:16.036 --> 01:59:18.457
I know about you, Collie.

1707
01:59:18.628 --> 01:59:21.345
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
01:59:22.052 --> 01:59:24.703
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
01:59:25.572 --> 01:59:28.801
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
01:59:29.732 --> 01:59:33.888
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
01:59:55.011 --> 01:59:57.346
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:00:18.051 --> 02:00:19.578
<i>Frank?</i>

1713
02:00:19.747 --> 02:00:21.176
Yeah?

1714
02:00:22.851 --> 02:00:24.029
Who's this?

1715
02:00:25.858 --> 02:00:27.419
Gwen?

1716
02:00:28.515 --> 02:00:30.522
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:00:31.555 --> 02:00:33.278
Frank got shot.

1718
02:00:36.003 --> 02:00:38.305
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:00:46.338 --> 02:00:47.899
I got him!

1720
02:00:48.066 --> 02:00:50.401
I got Costello here!

1721
02:00:54.370 --> 02:00:56.759
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:00:57.506 --> 02:00:59.000
No, it's...

1723
02:01:00.354 --> 02:01:01.881
For you.

1724
02:01:02.914 --> 02:01:05.849
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:01:09.218 --> 02:01:12.316
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:01:12.514 --> 02:01:14.848
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:01:15.010 --> 02:01:17.693
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:01:18.626 --> 02:01:19.935
You know that guy?

1729
02:01:20.098 --> 02:01:22.847
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:01:29.985 --> 02:01:31.578
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:01:31.745 --> 02:01:34.298
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:01:34.466 --> 02:01:35.960
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:01:37.442 --> 02:01:39.132
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:01:39.297 --> 02:01:41.119
Long time.

1735
02:01:41.282 --> 02:01:43.038
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:01:43.425 --> 02:01:48.160
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:01:50.881 --> 02:01:54.078
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:01:54.241 --> 02:01:55.866
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:01:56.769 --> 02:01:59.038
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:02:00.993 --> 02:02:02.717
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:02:02.881 --> 02:02:05.564
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:02:05.729 --> 02:02:07.638
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:02:07.809 --> 02:02:10.591
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:02:10.752 --> 02:02:14.200
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:02:14.465 --> 02:02:17.312
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:02:17.472 --> 02:02:21.269
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:02:23.808 --> 02:02:26.012
How's that working for you?

1748
02:02:26.176 --> 02:02:27.834
Is it helpful?

1749
02:02:28.544 --> 02:02:31.195
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:02:33.696 --> 02:02:36.795
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:39.802
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:02:39.968 --> 02:02:43.001
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:02:43.168 --> 02:02:46.845
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:02:47.008 --> 02:02:49.496
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:02:49.664 --> 02:02:52.119
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:02:52.287 --> 02:02:54.360
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:02:54.528 --> 02:02:56.829
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:02:56.991 --> 02:02:58.333
Fair enough.

1759
02:02:58.911 --> 02:03:03.189
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:03:05.279 --> 02:03:06.261
It's my name.

1761
02:03:07.039 --> 02:03:09.308
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:03:09.471 --> 02:03:12.602
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:03:13.151 --> 02:03:15.006
It's your name.

1764
02:03:17.024 --> 02:03:18.365
All right.

1765
02:03:18.527 --> 02:03:21.113
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.418
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:03:23.583 --> 02:03:25.754
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:03:25.919 --> 02:03:29.531
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:04:59.037 --> 02:05:02.714
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:05:32.412 --> 02:05:34.103
I know.

1771
02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:37.969
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:05:38.237 --> 02:05:39.763
I'm not.

1773
02:05:41.885 --> 02:05:45.016
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:47.514
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:05:47.676 --> 02:05:49.203
For me.

1776
02:05:51.389 --> 02:05:52.915
Okay?

1777
02:05:56.380 --> 02:06:00.504
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:06:00.668 --> 02:06:04.465
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:06:04.635 --> 02:06:07.091
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:06:08.636 --> 02:06:10.162
Please.

1781
02:06:13.564 --> 02:06:15.866
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:06:16.028 --> 02:06:18.613
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:06:18.779 --> 02:06:21.910
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:06:23.291 --> 02:06:25.364
There's no one else.

1785
02:06:26.107 --> 02:06:28.725
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:06:29.307 --> 02:06:31.195
You know, I have...

1787
02:06:31.356 --> 02:06:33.690
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:06:33.851 --> 02:06:35.956
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:06:36.123 --> 02:06:39.505
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:07:08.058 --> 02:07:09.913
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:07:11.226 --> 02:07:15.252
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:07:16.154 --> 02:07:19.253
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:07:27.738 --> 02:07:30.291
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:32.697
Really?

1795
02:07:33.338 --> 02:07:34.800
Yeah.

1796
02:07:34.970 --> 02:07:38.385
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:07:38.554 --> 02:07:40.659
...is a penis.

1798
02:07:43.802 --> 02:07:45.591
It's a boy.

1799
02:07:45.754 --> 02:07:48.437
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:07:49.881 --> 02:07:51.791
Can you still...?

1801
02:08:40.281 --> 02:08:42.190
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1802
02:08:42.361 --> 02:08:46.387
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1803
02:08:46.553 --> 02:08:50.066
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1804
02:08:50.233 --> 02:08:52.949
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1805
02:08:53.112 --> 02:08:58.197
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1806
02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.426
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1807
02:09:01.592 --> 02:09:03.861
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1808
02:09:04.024 --> 02:09:07.286
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1809
02:09:07.448 --> 02:09:11.157
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1810
02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.174
What?

1811
02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:21.069
What?

1812
02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:25.492
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1813
02:09:25.656 --> 02:09:29.453
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1814
02:09:29.623 --> 02:09:30.900
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1815
02:09:31.064 --> 02:09:34.511
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1816
02:09:34.679 --> 02:09:39.054
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1817
02:09:39.223 --> 02:09:42.038
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:09:46.999 --> 02:09:48.941
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:09:49.112 --> 02:09:53.487
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:09:53.655 --> 02:09:55.084
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:09:55.255 --> 02:09:56.946
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:09:57.111 --> 02:09:59.020
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1823
02:09:59.671 --> 02:10:02.737
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:10:03.223 --> 02:10:05.710
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:10:05.879 --> 02:10:07.821
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:10:08.118 --> 02:10:11.795
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:10:11.958 --> 02:10:13.813
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:10:25.431 --> 02:10:27.121
Open the door.

1829
02:10:30.966 --> 02:10:34.796
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1830
02:10:35.926 --> 02:10:37.999
This is my job.

1831
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:04.139
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:11:04.309 --> 02:11:05.771
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:11:05.942 --> 02:11:09.040
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:11:09.205 --> 02:11:10.699
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:11:10.869 --> 02:11:12.811
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:11:12.982 --> 02:11:16.430
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:11:16.597 --> 02:11:19.445
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:11:19.605 --> 02:11:22.954
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:11:23.125 --> 02:11:25.035
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:11:25.206 --> 02:11:26.994
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:11:27.157 --> 02:11:29.459
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:11:29.621 --> 02:11:32.338
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:11:32.501 --> 02:11:34.323
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:11:34.485 --> 02:11:37.616
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:11:37.781 --> 02:11:40.781
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:11:40.949 --> 02:11:43.502
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:46.035
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:11:46.197 --> 02:11:48.782
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:11:48.949 --> 02:11:53.226
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:11:53.397 --> 02:11:56.048
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:11:58.676 --> 02:12:00.815
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:12:00.981 --> 02:12:02.606
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:12:03.028 --> 02:12:04.851
Get up.

1854
02:12:05.973 --> 02:12:08.875
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:12:09.044 --> 02:12:11.466
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:12:11.637 --> 02:12:14.866
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:12:15.029 --> 02:12:17.876
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:12:18.036 --> 02:12:20.076
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:12:20.244 --> 02:12:22.382
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:12:22.548 --> 02:12:26.094
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:30.733
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:12:33.044 --> 02:12:34.899
Maybe you do.

1863
02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:37.100
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:12:37.267 --> 02:12:40.115
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:12:40.276 --> 02:12:43.123
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:12:43.283 --> 02:12:45.291
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:12:45.459 --> 02:12:47.564
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.496
You know who I am.

1869
02:13:16.595 --> 02:13:18.383
Shut up.

1870
02:13:19.379 --> 02:13:22.281
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:13:22.451 --> 02:13:23.596
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:13:23.763 --> 02:13:26.184
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:13:36.882 --> 02:13:39.086
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:13:40.626 --> 02:13:42.698
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:13:44.882 --> 02:13:46.857
I am killing you.

1876
02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:24.204
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:14:24.433 --> 02:14:26.637
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:14:26.801 --> 02:14:28.427
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:31.343
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:14:44.401 --> 02:14:45.928
Give me that.

1881
02:15:00.721 --> 02:15:03.950
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1882
02:15:11.824 --> 02:15:13.929
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1883
02:15:14.096 --> 02:15:18.439
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1884
02:15:18.608 --> 02:15:20.681
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1885
02:15:20.849 --> 02:15:23.183
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1886
02:15:23.344 --> 02:15:25.449
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1887
02:15:25.616 --> 02:15:28.649
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:15:31.696 --> 02:15:33.867
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:15:34.576 --> 02:15:38.373
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:15:48.911 --> 02:15:51.148
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:15:51.312 --> 02:15:54.094
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:15:54.256 --> 02:15:56.939
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:15:57.103 --> 02:15:59.340
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:15:59.504 --> 02:16:04.141
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:16:04.304 --> 02:16:05.830
Amen.

1896
02:16:34.063 --> 02:16:36.202
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:16:37.518 --> 02:16:39.428
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:16:39.663 --> 02:16:41.223
Fire.

1899
02:16:41.391 --> 02:16:43.780
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:16:44.655 --> 02:16:47.557
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:16:47.982 --> 02:16:51.146
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:17:04.014 --> 02:17:06.283
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:17:13.262 --> 02:17:15.018
What about the baby?

1904
02:17:32.014 --> 02:17:33.574
Hi, pup.

1905
02:18:03.821 --> 02:18:05.381
Okay.
