- Ma'am.

700
00:57:56.975 --> 00:57:59.936
Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

701
00:58:00.019 --> 00:58:03.523
I want you to know my entire police force
is at your disposal.

702
00:58:04.273 --> 00:58:05.692
Well, that could
be very useful.

703
00:58:05.775 --> 00:58:09.028
You know, there are people in this country
spending half their paycheck

704
00:58:09.112 --> 00:58:10.613
just to get
clean water.

705
00:58:10.697 --> 00:58:11.739
What do you
think of that?

706
00:58:11.823 --> 00:58:13.908
The Bolivian government
is the problem.

707
00:58:13.992 --> 00:58:15.660
They cut down the trees,

708
00:58:15.743 --> 00:58:19.872
then act surprised when the water and
the soil wash out to sea.

709
00:58:19.956 --> 00:58:23.459
I couldn't agree more.
I hope this figure is to your liking.

710
00:58:23.543 --> 00:58:25.920
<i>Chéri,</i> you
shouldn't tease.

711
00:58:26.004 --> 00:58:30.049
Why don't you tell them about all the land
you bought up outside Potosí?

712
00:58:30.133 --> 00:58:32.343
It's been a pleasure.
Will you excuse me?

713
00:58:32.427 --> 00:58:33.761
Of course.

714
00:58:33.845 --> 00:58:35.013
CAMILLE: Somehow
the logging rights

715
00:58:35.096 --> 00:58:38.516
went to a multinational
corporation that cut down the forests,

716
00:58:39.267 --> 00:58:43.354
but only after our last government sold the
land to Greene Planet.

718
00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.275

my facts crossed?

719
00:58:47.358 --> 00:58:49.277
(CHUCKING) Yes,
I think you did.

720
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:51.362
You'll excuse us?

721
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.990
What a wonderful night.

722
00:58:58.036 --> 00:59:00.621
You just cost me quite a bit of money,
darling.

723
00:59:00.705 --> 00:59:02.498
You can't put a price on integrity.

724
00:59:03.499 --> 00:59:04.542
I can try.

725
00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:05.626
Oh!

726
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:11.883
Thank you.

727
00:59:11.966 --> 00:59:15.928
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

728
00:59:16.012 --> 00:59:19.474
Or are you still after
this General's head for your mantel?

729
00:59:20.016 --> 00:59:21.559
A little of both.

730
00:59:21.642 --> 00:59:25.396
Tell me where Medrano is and maybe
you won't lose any more investors.

731

732

734
00:59:35.823 --> 00:59:36.991
Are you going
to throw me over?

735
00:59:37.617 --> 00:59:39.243
No. You've
been drinking,

736
00:59:39.327 --> 00:59:40.369
so maybe you slipped.

737
00:59:40.453 --> 00:59:44.832
(POUTS) Oh. Just think
how much you'd miss me.

There you are.

741
00:59:54.675 --> 00:59:55.885
Would you
excuse me?

742
00:59:56.719 --> 00:59:58.054
Mr. Bond.

743
00:59:59.097 --> 01:00:00.264
What a pleasure.

744
01:00:02.892 --> 01:00:05.103
Well, careful with this one.
She won't go to bed with you

745
01:00:05.186 --> 01:00:07.313
unless you give her something
she really wants.

746
01:00:07.939 --> 01:00:10.108
It's a shame because
she's really quite stunning

747
01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:12.318

on her back.

748

How much do you know
about Bond, Camille?

753
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:27.125
Because he's rather
a tragic case.

754
01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:30.128
As MI6 says, he's
difficult to control.

755
01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:34.841

he touches seems to wither and die.
