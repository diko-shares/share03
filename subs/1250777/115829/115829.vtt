1
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.948
<i>Guardian of the universe.</i>

2
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.780
<i>Protecting us against the forces of evil.</i>

3
00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.035
<i>The superpowers of this man...</i>

4
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.412
<i>He can catch a bullet,
mount a speeding train.</i>

5
00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:35.915
<i>And leap tall buildings in a single bound.</i>

6
00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:38.213
<i>- Up in the sky...
- It's a bird.</i>

7
00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.540
<i>A mailman by day...</i>

8
00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:41.170
<i>City's guardian by night.</i>

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.379
<i>Defending the citizens
of New York from the forces of evil.</i>

10
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.715
<i>The world has been protected
by a group of extraordinary men and women</i>

11
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.766
<i>who have dedicated themselves
to fighting crime.</i>

12
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.889
<i>Mysterious traveler from another dimension.</i>

13
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.145
<i>He has powers far beyond
the capabilities of mere earthlings.</i>

14
00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:10.280
<i>I always wondered
why nobody did it before me.</i>

15
00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.664
<i>I mean, all those comic books,
movies, TV shows,</i>

16
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.502
<i>you'd think that one eccentric loner
would have made himself a costume.</i>

17
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.006
<i>I mean, is everyday life really so exciting?</i>

18
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:27.092
<i>Are schools and offices so thrilling</i>

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.389
<i>that I'm the only one
who ever fantasized about this?</i>

20
00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.101
<i>Come on, be honest with yourself.</i>

21
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.974
<i>At some point in our lives,
we all wanted to be a superhero.</i>

22
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.204
<i>That's not me, by the way.</i>

23
00:01:56.617 --> 00:02:00.713
<i>That's some Armenian guy
with a history of mental health problems.</i>

24
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.545
<i>Who am I? I'm Kick-Ass.</i>

25
00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:18.223
<i>That's me,
back before any of this crazy shit happened.</i>

26
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.394
<i>I guess I was the last person
you'd expect to become a superhero.</i>

27
00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.151
<i>I'm not saying
there was anything wrong with me,</i>

28
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.733
<i>but there was nothing special, either.</i>

29
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.160
- Asshole.
<i>- I wasn't into sports.</i>

30
00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.738
<i>I wasn't a mathlete or a hardcore gamer.</i>

31
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:40.749
<i>I didn't have a piercing or an eating disorder
or 3,000 friends on MySpace.</i>

32
00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.589
<i>My only superpower
was being invisible to girls.</i>

33
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:49.086
<i>And out of my friends, man,
I wasn't even the funny one.</i>

34
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.464
<i>Like most people my age, I just existed.</i>

35
00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.110
Good morning, class.

36
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.610
Please open your books to Act 2, Scene 2.

37
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.069
<i>Kick in my bedroom door,
and you'd probably find me watching TV</i>

38
00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.408
<i>or talking to my friend Todd on Skype...</i>

39
00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.115
<i>- Are you watching</i> Family Guy?
- Nope.

40
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:22.078
<i>Me, either. Check out nippleslip.com.
It's good.</i>

41
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.550
<i>...or jerking off,
mostly to my English teacher.</i>

42
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.587
Dave Lizewski.

43
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.391
Don't think I haven't noticed
you looking at my tits, Dave.

44
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.436
I want your hands all over me, Dave.

45
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.225
Please.

46
00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:45.063
<i>Sure, a lot of what got me
through the average school day</i>

47
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:48.612
<i>was making deposits
in the whack-off warehouse for later.</i>

48
00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.530
<i>Though to be honest,</i>

49
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.448
<i>it didn't take much to set me off.</i>

50
00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.491
<i>I swear, when my hormones balance out,</i>

51
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.823
<i>shares in Kleenex
are gonna take a dive, man.</i>

52
00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:06.664
Dave Lizewski, shouldn't you be looking
at <i>Hamlet</i> right now?

53
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.332
Yes, Mrs. Zane.

54
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.794
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.549
<i>But don't get me wrong.
I like girls my own age, too.</i>

56
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.426
<i>Especially Katie Deauxma.</i>

57
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.510
Hey, gorgeous.

58
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.353
Hey.

59
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.934
Oh, no.

60
00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.109
Uh... Uh...

61
00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:32.361
You meant Erika. Uh, I know. I knew that.

62
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.108
I was just kidding.

63
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.155
Okay, cool.

64
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.195
Oh, my God.

65
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.367
Hey. Look, I'm Todd's mom.

66
00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.955
Oh, that's funny. This is your dad.

67
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.291
No, that's still my mom, actually.

68
00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.303
What the fuck!

69
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.430
<i>I was just a regular guy.</i>

70
00:04:57.506 --> 00:05:02.307
<i>No radioactive spiders, no refugee status
from a doomed alien world.</i>

71
00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.814
You know what?
Todd said they do still make Count Chocula.

72
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.813
They just don't sell it at the store anymore.

73
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:12.650
<i>My mother was killed
by an aneurism in the kitchen...</i>

74
00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.482
- Mom?
<i>- ...as opposed to a gunman in the alley.</i>

75
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.691
<i>So if you were hoping for any...</i>

76
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:20.029
"I will avenge you, Mother!"

77
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.328
<i>...you're out of luck.</i>

78
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.657
<i>In the 18 months since my mother died,</i>

79
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.335
<i>the only epiphany I had
was realizing that life just goes on.</i>

80
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.754
Did they change the bee's face?

81
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:31.878
No.

82
00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.551
How come nobody's ever tried
to be a superhero?

83
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:43.726
Boy, I don't know.

84
00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.896
Probably 'cause it's fucking impossible,
dipshit.

85
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.191
What, putting on a mask and
helping people? How's that impossible?

86
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.360
That's not superhero, though.
How is that super?

87
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.984
Super's like being stronger than everybody
and flying and shit. That's just hero.

88
00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.406
No, it's not even hero.

89
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.483
- It's just fucking psycho.
- Hmm.

90
00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:01.537
Hello? Bruce Wayne?
He didn't have any powers.

91
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.034
Yes, but he had all the expensive shit
that doesn't exist.

92
00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:06.208
I thought you meant, like,
"How come nobody does it in real life?"

93
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.705
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

94
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.412
Dude, if anybody did it in real life,
they'd get their ass kicked.

95
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.589
- They'd be dead in, like, a day.
- A day.

96
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.462
Yeah, okay, I'm not saying they should do it.

97
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.293
I just can't figure out why nobody does.

98
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:20.506
Seriously, out of all the millions of people
who love superheroes,

99
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.762
you'd think one would give it a try.

100
00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.720
Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?

101
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.520
Why thousands of people
wanna be Paris Hilton

102
00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:28.939
and nobody wants to be Spider-Man?

103
00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.938
Yeah, what's with that?
She has, like, no tits at all.

104
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.520
Maybe it's the porn tape.
He doesn't have a porn tape.

105
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:36.150
You guys never saw
<i>One Night in Spider-Man?</i>

106
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.071
Guess who?

107
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:47.200
Is it me or do you kind of feel sorry
for Chris D'Amico?

108
00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.494
Yeah, it must be terrible
to have a rich dad and everything you want.

109
00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:51.919
I wish you wouldn't have said anything

110
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.339
- 'cause I feel like I'm gonna start crying.
- Right.

111
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.008
The fact that he's always on his own?

112
00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:02.927
We should, like, talk to him.
See if he wants to hang out with us.

113
00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.849
I didn't say we should talk to him. I just...

114
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.427
Think about it. Come on, it'd be awesome.

115
00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.479
If he was our friend,
no one would ever fuck with us again.

116
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.771
Well, go on then, Todd. You wanna...

117
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:11.894
- I can get up.
- No, no...

118
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.351
- You wanna go talk to him? I can move.
- Dave... Dave should go.

119
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.653
- Dave should go.
- Why?

120
00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.230
- Dave, you should totally go.
- Go.

121
00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.940
- You're a dick.
- Don't be afraid, Dave.

122
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.445
You're a pussy.

123
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.616
Fuck off.

124
00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.123
Did you spray anything over there?

125
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:40.336
Yeah, I think
I might have just shat in my pants a little.

126
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.553
- See you later.
- God, see you.

127
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.473
If that guy would have spoken to me
like that, I would have kicked his ass.

128
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.801
Todd, when have you ever
kicked anyone's ass?

129
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.478
Whatever, man.
I would have just gone for his knees.

130
00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.056
- You're not making sense.
- What I'm saying is the centrifugal force

131
00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.143
of Batman's batarang would undoubtedly
penetrate the Joker's force field,

132
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.695
- leaving him totally vulnerable to the...
- All right...

133
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.522
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pussy patrol.
- Fuck.

134
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.693
- Phones, money.
- Dude, not again, come on.

135
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.245
- Phone.
- I don't have one.

136
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.073
- Someone else jacked it last week.
- Pussy.

137
00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.876
- Give me the bag.
- It's just comics.

138
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.248
Yo, you want to get cut?

139
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.512
<i>Look at this asshole just watching.</i>

140
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.640
<i>Come on, be honest with yourself.</i>

141
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.938
<i>Would you do anything differently?</i>

142
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.822
<i>We see someone in trouble
and we wish we could help,</i>

143
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.365
<i>but we don't.</i>

144
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:52.620
<i>The world I lived in,
heroes only existed in comic books.</i>

145
00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:58.497
<i>And I guess that would have been okay
if bad guys were make-believe, too.</i>

146
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.878
<i>But they're not.</i>

147
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.132
Frankie, I'm telling you, man,
I swear I'm not making this up.

148
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:10.051
This fucking guy comes out of nowhere,
kicks our asses,

149
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.101
and steals all the coke.

150
00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.975
This would be the guy
that looks like Batman?

151
00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.772
I didn't say he looked like Batman.

152
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.691
You did, Tre.
You said the guy looked like Batman.

153
00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.815
- He said like a mask and stuff.
- And a cape.

154
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.067
- Yeah, like Batman.
- I didn't say "Like Batman."

155
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.739
I never said "Batman."

156
00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:25.906
Okay.

157
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.953
Let me tell you the problem
I got with that, Tre.

158
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:33.783
Our mole with the Russians
tells things a little different.

159
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:39.045
According to him, you sold him my coke
and you took the money.

160
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.963
That's a fucking lie!

161
00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:45.506
I can't believe that you would believe
this shit from a fucking Russian, man!

162
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.589
Let me see, Tre.
Hey, what's more likely, huh?

163
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:53.852
That you're a greedy little cocksucker
or all my coke was stolen by Superman?

164
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.804
- Batman.
- I never said Batman!

165
00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.104
Enough!

166
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:03.611
Now my son is waiting out there
in the car to go to the movies,

167
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:05.029
and I ain't gonna disappoint him.

168
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.400
Joe, you're in charge.

169
00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.031
- Frank... Frankie!
- That's gotta be the worst fucking excuse

170
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.613
I ever heard, Tre.

171
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:23.127
- Sorry you had to wait, buddy.
- The movie is starting in 10 minutes.

172
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:26.506
It's okay. We're cool.
We're only gonna miss the trailers.

173
00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.507
Yeah. But I want to get some popcorn.

174
00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.463
When we get in there,
get Chris some popcorn.

175
00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.766
- Okay?
- You fucking motherfuckers!

176
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.184
What do you want to drink?
You want a Pepsi?

177
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:37.604
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Get him a Pepsi, and I'll have an Icee.

178
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.851
Mixed.

179
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.229
Like when they mix
the red one and the blue one.

180
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.486
And a pack of Twizzlers.

181
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.044
<i>The comic books had it wrong.</i>

182
00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:14.099
<i>It didn't take a trauma or cosmic rays
or a power ring to make a superhero.</i>

183
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:19.479
<i>Just the perfect combination
of optimism and naivety.</i>

184
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.095
You are fucking awesome.

185
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.933
Come on then, bring it on!

186
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.298
Daddy, I'm scared.

187
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.842
Come on, Mindy, honey.

188
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.004
Be a big girl now.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

189
00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.098
- Is it gonna hurt bad?
- Oh, child.

190
00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.426
Only for a second, sugar.

191
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.604
A handgun bullet travels at... More than?

192
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.148
- 700 miles an hour.
- 700 miles an hour.

193
00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:49.353
So at close range like this, the force
is gonna take you off your feet for sure,

194
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.530
but it's really no more painful
than a punch in the chest.

195
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.358
I hate getting punched in the chest.

196
00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.280
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

197
00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.754
How was that? Not so bad.

198
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:11.250
Kind of fun, huh?
Now you know how it feels.

199
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.882
You won't be scared
when some junkie asshole pulls a Glock.

200
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.760
- I wouldn't have been scared anyways.
- That's my girl.

201
00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:22.185
All right, up you get. Come on.
Two more rounds and then home.

202
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.054
- Again?
- Uh-huh.

203
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.523
Look, only if we can go
by the bowling alley on the way back.

204
00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.521
The bowling alley?

205
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.986
Yeah. And ice cream after.

206
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.521
Huh.

207
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.699
Okay. Two more rounds.

208
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:42.243
No wincing, no whining,
and you got yourself a deal, young lady.

209
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.166
Yeah! I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.

210
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.118
Good call, baby doll.

211
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:54.005
So, have you thought a little more about
what you might want for your birthday?

212
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.173
Can I get a puppy?

213
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.922
You wanna get a dog?

214
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.011
Yeah, a cuddly, fluffy one.

215
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.559
And a Bratz Movie Star Makeover Sasha.

216
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.517
I'm just fucking with you, Daddy.

217
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.319
Look, I'd love
a Benchmade Model 42 butterfly knife.

218
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.567
Oh, child.

219
00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:17.531
You always knock me for a loop.

220
00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.324
- You know what?
- What?

221
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.368
- I'm gonna get you two.
- Two?

222
00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.493
One balisong. Two balisong.
That's what you get.

223
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.220
"The glass of fashion and the mold of form

224
00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.932
"The observed of all observers
quite, quite down!

225
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:53.147
"And I, of ladies
most deject and wretched..."

226
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.487
<i>I'll be honest,</i>

227
00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:04.662
<i>there wasn't a whole lot
of crime-fighting in those first few weeks.</i>

228
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.911
<i>But even so,
my new vocation kept me plenty busy.</i>

229
00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.205
Shit.

230
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.256
<i>I called it preparation.</i>

231
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:24.132
<i>But if you called it fantasizing,
it would have been hard to argue.</i>

232
00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:28.224
<i>All I knew was
I'd never felt so good about myself.</i>

233
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.453
Fuck!

234
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.704
<i>Okay, maybe I was still
in the beta-testing phase,</i>

235
00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.043
<i>but it was a start.</i>

236
00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:11.725
What the fuck are you looking at?

237
00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.895
- Nothing.
- Get the fuck out of here.

238
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:22.198
<i>Like every serial killer already knew,</i>

239
00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.903
<i>eventually, fantasizing
just doesn't do it for you anymore.</i>

240
00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.279
<i>It was time to engage.</i>

241
00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:31.620
Hurry up, man.

242
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.329
What the fuck?

243
00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.927
What the fuck you looking at?

244
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.598
I said, what the fuck are you looking at?

245
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.934
Two cheap-shit losers screwing with a car

246
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:01.442
that someone probably
worked their ass off to pay for.

247
00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.532
- Say what?
- Leave it be, man.

248
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.449
This motherfucker is obviously high.

249
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:10.621
I'm not high.

250
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.533
I just think it sucks
you guys think you can do what you want.

251
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.625
Just walk away from the car
and we can forget about this.

252
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.258
You're crazy, man.

253
00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.127
Fuck this shit.

254
00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.481
- Shit!
- Let's get out of here!

255
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.982
<i>I came around for just long enough
to beg the medic</i>

256
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.689
<i>not to tell anybody about the costume.</i>

257
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.074
<i>He promised he wouldn't.</i>

258
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.158
<i>All I knew was my dad was gonna kill me.</i>

259
00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:51.005
Why can't I have a gun?
I'm a security guard.

260
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.466
You're a doorman now.
You don't get a gun no more.

261
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.892
Look at me. I look like a putz.

262
00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.972
You look sharp. Look at all them buttons.
Do your job. Open the fucking door.

263
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:03.559
Have a nice day.

264
00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:34.264
- Good morning, Frank.
- Hey, Joe, how you doing?

265
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.308
- Great.
- Want some coffee?

266
00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.265
Maybe later. Morning, Ange.

267
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.853
- Good morning.
- Chris.

268
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.602
Good morning, Joe.

269
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.141
Frank, we got a thing.

270
00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.903
It's a big thing, Frank.

271
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.066
Okay.

272
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.651
Sorry, hon.

273
00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:55.994
Do what you got to do.

274
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.497
Chris, where do you think you're going?

275
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.829
- I got to talk to Dad.
- Christopher.

276
00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.380
Frank, honey!

277
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.210
Where do you think you're going?

278
00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.294
I don't...
I don't mind you talking business, Dad.

279
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.384
I was just gonna sit in there quietly.

280
00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.886
I mean, I should probably
start learning this stuff anyway, right?

281
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.680
Hey, go finish your oatmeal.

282
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:22.684
God damn it! I'm gonna be 18
in eight months, for Christ's sakes.

283
00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.019
Fuck.

284
00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:27.310
Take a seat.

285
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:33.233
- So what's the problem?
- Our Russian says that Tre just sold him

286
00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.784
another five keys at half price.

287
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.158
Which Tre? Tre Tre?

288
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.864
Right. Dead Tre.

289
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.241
So now I'm getting fucked
in the ass by a ghost?

290
00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.168
Or Tre was telling the truth.

291
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:49.583
What, this is my choice,
I gotta believe in ghosts or superheroes?

292
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.005
Well, not the part about
the superhero, Frankie,

293
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.429
but just that he might have
really been gaffled by somebody.

294
00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:03.097
I think we'd better invite
our Russian over for a friendly chat,

295
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.233
see what's really going on.

296
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:23.915
Hey, early birdie.

297
00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:27.287
Aw! You beat me to it.
I wanted to get you breakfast this morning.

298
00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:30.456
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

299
00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.467
Check this out.

300
00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:44.224
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

301
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:45.725
Oh, my gosh.

302
00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.188
Dad.

303
00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:51.439
Wow.

304
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.146
Watch, Dad.

305
00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.148
Okay, pop quiz.

306
00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:56.858
What's the proper name for one of those?

307
00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.490
Easy, balisong.
It's Filipino. Ask me another.

308
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:00.740
Excellent, good.

309
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:06.668
The AR-15 was a lighter,
smaller caliber version of what design?

310
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:09.791
Uh, Eugene Stoner's AR-10.
Now give me a hard one.

311
00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:11.914
The name of

312
00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:16.586
John Woo's first full-length feature?

313
00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:19.217
<i>Tie Han rou qing, The Young Dragons.</i>

314
00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:20.965
Daddy, look.

315
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:23.680
Hey, come on, you're not looking.

316
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:29.065
The point is,
some fucker is killing our guys.

317
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.651
Until we find out who that is,
I don't wanna see

318
00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:34.353
any of you bitches sitting around
on your asses, all right?

319
00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:36.109
What the fuck do you...

320
00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:37.611
Hello?

321
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.692
Hey, Joe, yeah.

322
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:42.115
No, he's just training right now.

323
00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:43.491
One second.

324
00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.869
Dad, phone!

325
00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:50.040
- Dad, the phone's for you.
- Who is it?

326
00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:51.624
It's Joe.

327
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:57.426
- What's the problem?
<i>- Yeah, Frank,</i>

328
00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.469
turns out we ain't got the vise here no more.

329
00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:00.797
<i>- Really?</i>
- Uh-uh.

330
00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.932
But we do got
a brand-new industrial microwave.

331
00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:05.180
They use it for treating the lumber.

332
00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:06.977
Well, that is neat.

333
00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:09.388
I think you must be confusing me
with someone

334
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.519
<i>who gives a shit about the fucking lumber!</i>

335
00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:13.897
Yeah, okay, all right, Frank.
All right, I'm sorry.

336
00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:15.444
- I'm sorry, okay?
<i>- ...get the information.</i>

337
00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:17.146
All right, okay!

338
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.652
All right, come on. Go ahead.

339
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.444
Hey, look, the guys tell me
he's Tre Fernandez. What do I know, huh?

340
00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.279
- Shut up.
- Now you say Fernandez is dead.

341
00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:27.330
- Get inside. Shut up!
- Okay, no, he lied!

342
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.829
- He lie about...
- Fucking mamaluke.

343
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.164
He lied!

344
00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:33.879
Does this work like
a regular microwave or what?

345
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.833
Fuck do I know? We're not making
a fucking Hungry-Man dinner here.

346
00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.509
Just turn it on.

347
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:42.504
Here we go.

348
00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:45.341
Okay, I wanna know who sold you our coke.

349
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:48.936
And don't tell me somebody
who's dead this time.

350
00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:55.276
Can he hear you?
I don't think he can hear you.

351
00:23:56.769 --> 00:24:00.319
I said, who really sold you our coke?

352
00:24:04.193 --> 00:24:05.365
Who

353
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.867
sold you

354
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.453
our coke?

355
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.003
Shit. Shit.

356
00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:23.967
This is awesome!
I look like fricking Wolverine.

357
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.508
They still have
that metal detector at your school?

358
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:29.969
Yeah, it's gonna have a meltdown.

359
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:34.894
Dave, I need to ask you something.

360
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:37.893
Okay.

361
00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:39.820
The police report,

362
00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:41.192
they found you naked.

363
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:43.694
You said you didn't remember why.

364
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.444
The muggers, they didn't...

365
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:48.862
What?

366
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.992
No! Jesus.

367
00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:55.665
No, I... I wasn't even...

368
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:58.956
In the ambulance,
they threw my clothes away

369
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.586
- 'cause of the blood.
- Right.

370
00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:02.794
Okay, okay.

371
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.383
Dad. Dad.

372
00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:11.177
<i>Seemed like no time at all
before I was back on my feet.</i>

373
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.479
- Dave's what?
- Shh. Not now.

374
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.515
<i>Apart from some messed up nerve endings,</i>

375
00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:19.693
<i>the doctors had managed
to fix me up pretty good.</i>

376
00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:21.361
- Did you feel that?
- No.

377
00:25:21.437 --> 00:25:23.940
You're like fucking Jason Bourne
or something, man. That owns.

378
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.859
- How about that?
- No, Marty!

379
00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:28.869
Give it a fucking rest, man.

380
00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:30.287
I've only been back half a day,

381
00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:32.285
and you're already
making me miss the hospital.

382
00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:35.208
He's right. I'm sorry.
I'm acting totally childish.

383
00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:37.207
- Stop with the fork.
- I apologize.

384
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:49.923
Hey.

385
00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:53.385
Dave, hey.

386
00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:56.388
Oh. Hey.

387
00:25:57.806 --> 00:25:59.934
How are you? You look better.

388
00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:03.646
I'm good. Yeah, much better.

389
00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:05.572
Hey, you're into comic books, aren't you?

390
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:09.031
Well, me and Erika
sometimes hang out after school

391
00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:10.986
at this really great store Atomic Comics.

392
00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:14.452
They make the best
white chocolate mocha latte.

393
00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:15.657
Yeah?

394
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:21.248
Well, I could buy you one sometime
if you, you know, like,

395
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.298
need someone to talk to.

396
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.048
Sure. Thank you.

397
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.846
Okay, sweet. Well, I'll see you later.

398
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:31.299
Mmm.

399
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:35.094
- Man, did you see that?
- Yeah.

400
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:37.350
Katie Deauxma just offered to buy me coffee.

401
00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.228
Yeah. You know,
I really don't think that's what it looks like.

402
00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:43.026
- What are you talking about?
- The point is,

403
00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.854
Katie Deauxma's all about the lame ducks.

404
00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:47.151
What's this got to do with me?

405
00:26:47.231 --> 00:26:49.734
I've been trying to figure out
how to tell you this.

406
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.112
- There's a rumor going around...
- Right.

407
00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:54.697
- ...that you...
- What?

408
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.657
- ...are gay.
- Gay?

409
00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:58.204
What kind of rumor is that?

410
00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:59.580
Well, you know, I mean, getting mugged...

411
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.083
- You guys have been mugged!
- Yeah, I know, but,

412
00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:04.756
you know, we didn't get beat up
and have all our clothes taken off.

413
00:27:04.832 --> 00:27:07.711
That's not even true.
The medic threw my clothes away.

414
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.963
You know, don't worry about it.
Rumors don't mean shit.

415
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.969
- We know the truth. Yeah.
- Right?

416
00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:15.471
And who knows, buddy,
this might even get you laid.

417
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:18.805
No, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd.
You fucking retard.

418
00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:20.685
Thanks, Marty,
this is really fucking helping me.

419
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:21.890
I'm just being honest!

420
00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:28.025
<i>I was getting back to my old self.</i>

421
00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:32.568
<i>I should have quit, of course,
but you can't just reprogram yourself.</i>

422
00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:36.447
<i>What you want, who you are,
your purpose in life.</i>

423
00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:38.992
Oh, no, I'm just standing around, you know.

424
00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:41.335
No, I'm not!

425
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.502
<i>It is what it is.</i>

426
00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:44.455
How about that, huh?

427
00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:48.964
Oh, yeah. Didn't see that, did you?

428
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:50.885
I think it's best that you just walk away.

429
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:52.258
Well, maybe you shouldn't do that.

430
00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:55.512
What? Huh? Are you looking at me?
Well, this is my business.

431
00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:10.606
<i>Me? My hardware was fixed now.</i>

432
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:14.485
<i>I was back and running Kick-Ass version 2.0.</i>

433
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:26.121
Excuse me, have you seen this cat?

434
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.503
- No.
- No? Okay, thank you.

435
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.589
Excuse me, ma'am. Have you seen this cat?

436
00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:36.173
I'm sorry. Did you see this cat?

437
00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:38.763
No? Okay.

438
00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:01.164
Oh, great.

439
00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:05.498
Here, kitty. Here, Mr. Bitey.

440
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.797
Come on... No, no, no, no, no!

441
00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:14.674
No, no, no. Mr. Bitey, come on.

442
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.719
Back here, come on.
Let's get you home. Come on.

443
00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:32.529
Fuck you, Mr. Bitey!

444
00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:39.365
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry, man.
- You fucking green...

445
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.744
Get up. Get him up.

446
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:45.538
- Get up.
- Thanks, freak.

447
00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:51.798
- Hey, leave him alone!
- Fuck off, man. It's none of your business!

448
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.087
Yes, it is.

449
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:25.991
Hey! Call 911!

450
00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.295

dressed like a superhero out there

452
00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:41.552
It's fucking awesome!

453
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.286
Leave him alone!

454
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:19.670
Give it up, man. Just walk away.

455
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.088
No. Never.

456
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:24.808
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

457
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:29.183
You'd rather die for some piece of shit
that you don't even fucking know?

458
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:31.393
And three assholes

459
00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:33.521
laying into one guy
while everybody else watches,

460
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:37.191
and you want to know what's wrong with me?

461
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:41.821
Yeah, I'd rather die.

462
00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:43.944
So bring it on!

463
00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:49.282
You're fucking crazy, kid.

464
00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:54.579
Fuck.

465

466

He was actually pretty good.

498
00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:43.814
Good at getting his ass kicked.

499
00:33:43.897 --> 00:33:47.367
He should call himself
Ass-Kick instead.

500
00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:48.659

I got 100 guys who can fix a problem,

506
00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:03.459
you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?

507
00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:06.842
Well, I wouldn't wanna get in the way
of your business, where I'm not wanted.

508
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.423
<i>Please, I know
you have mistaken me for Kick-Ass,</i>

509
00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.474
<i>but I am not Kick-Ass.</i>

510
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.080
- So you don't actually read comics?
- Yeah, I just started.

511
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:34.701
I got recommended some.

512
00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:37.830
Like <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> and <i>Shojo Beat,</i>
that kind of thing.

513
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.788
I'm not really into
the whole superhero thing, though.

514
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:45.171
So I guess you're not gonna line up
for that new Kick-Ass comic then?

515
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.297
I guess not.

516
00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:49.630
But you know what?
I was seriously thinking of mailing his site.

517
00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:52.136
I mean, I could really use some help
from a guy like that right now.

518
00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:54.843
Help? Really? What with?

519
00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.770
You know I volunteer at the needle exchange.

520
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.056
No, I didn't.

521
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.735
Well, there's this one guy Rasul,
and I felt so sorry for him.

522
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:07.860
And the more I found out
about his upbringing and stuff, I just...

523
00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:13.696
Wow, that's weird.
I'm usually the one playing therapist.

524
00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:18.542
Can I make a confession?

525
00:35:19.242 --> 00:35:23.042
Ever since I was little,
I've always wanted a friend

526
00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.298
like you.

527
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.800
- Is it okay to say that?
- Yeah.

528
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:29.503
I mean, that's not homophobic, is it?

529
00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:34.098
I mean, I don't think
you're all the same or anything.

530
00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:46.687
- Of course not, no.
- Thank you.

531
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.951
<i>I don't know if I was everything Katie
had always dreamed her gay BFF would be,</i>

532
00:35:56.029 --> 00:35:57.702
<i>but I tried my best.</i>

533
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:01.411
<i>But more importantly,
I talked her into mailing Kick-Ass.</i>

534
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:06.502
<i>Long story short,
this particular lame duck of hers</i>

535
00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:09.255
<i>turned out to be more of a lame cobra.</i>

536
00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:12.132
<i>She didn't want the money back
that she'd given him</i>

537
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:15.466
<i>or an apology for the black eye
he'd given her.</i>

538
00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:17.676
<i>She just wanted him
to get that they were through</i>

539
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:19.352
<i>and leave her alone.</i>

540
00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:23.773
<i>And let's be real, no other request
could have given me more pleasure.</i>

541
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.460
Who the fuck are you supposed to be,
the Green Condom?

542
00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:48.210
You know it ain't Halloween
for another few months, kid?

543
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.461
I'm here to see Rasul.

544
00:36:51.668 --> 00:36:53.511
Who the fuck are you?

545
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:56.089
I'm... I'm a friend of Katie's.

546
00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:04.272
Kids nowadays in their tights.

547
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:21.665
So, which one of you guys is Rasul?

548
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:32.671
I'm Rasul. Can't you tell by my big titties?

549
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.507
What is this? Trick or treat or something?

550
00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:41.806
Fuck! Now I'm dead.

551
00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:46.519
Uh, I have a message for Rasul
about Katie Deauxma.

552
00:37:50.018 --> 00:37:52.316
- Katie?
- Oh, you're Rasul?

553
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:56.821
Okay. You gotta stay away from Katie now.
It's over.

554
00:37:57.192 --> 00:38:00.696
So if you just leave her alone,
everything will be fine.

555
00:38:01.362 --> 00:38:02.534
What?

556
00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:07.707
Yo, kid, who the hell are you?
And what is this?

557
00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:11.001
I'm Kick-Ass. Look me up.

558
00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:13.796
And this is me giving you a message.

559
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:15.923
Leave Katie alone.

560
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:29.773
Or what?

561
00:38:34.229 --> 00:38:36.573
Or I'll come back

562
00:38:38.107 --> 00:38:39.905
and break your fucking legs.

563
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:46.575
I'm right here now, baby. What's up?

564
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.287
Oh, fuck!

565
00:38:57.418 --> 00:38:58.670
Hold him.

566
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.558
You are so fucking dead, man.

567
00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:26.118
Okay, you cunts,
let's see what you can do now.

568
00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:31.454
Eeny, meeny, miny, Moe.

569
00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:42.547
Oh, shit!

570
00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.270
What the fuck?

571
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.470
Hey, I got one of those.

572
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:41.738
Come on.

573
00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:43.649
So you want to play.

574
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:01.918
What the fuck?

575
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:08.425
Oh, dude, that is one gay-looking Taser.

576
00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:13.809
Relax, we're on the same team.

577
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:16.399
- Hey, get up.
- No...

578
00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:26.033
Now, Hit Girl,
we always keep our backs where?

579
00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:28.570
To the wall, Daddy. I know.

580
00:41:28.778 --> 00:41:30.872
Um, it won't happen again.

581
00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:34.333
<i>- Nice shot, by the way.</i>
- Thank you.

582
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:53.470
Let's go.

583
00:41:54.887 --> 00:41:58.107
Hey, hey, asshole.
Can't use the front door now.

584
00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:14.457
Wait, wait, wait!

585
00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:16.496
What?

586
00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:18.624
Who are you?

587
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:20.209
Me?

588
00:42:21.122 --> 00:42:22.624
I'm Hit Girl.

589
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.176
And that's Big Daddy.

590
00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:34.184
Come on.

591
00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:40.145
Come on!

592
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:20.348
<i>Hit Girl and Big Daddy,
they were the real deal.</i>

593
00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:24.276
<i>Me?</i>

594
00:43:24.894 --> 00:43:27.647
<i>I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.</i>

595
00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:44.877
What is this? What am I looking at here?

596
00:43:45.665 --> 00:43:48.965
It was Sal's phone.
They found it in his hand.

597
00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:51.171
He must have taken that right before he died.

598
00:43:51.671 --> 00:43:55.847
I know this sounds fucked up, Frankie,
but that guy in the picture,

599
00:43:56.342 --> 00:43:59.437
I think it's that superhero nutjob from the TV.

600
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.721
Who?

601
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:02.894
Kick-Ass?

602
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:04.893
One guy?

603
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:08.191
Hold on, you're telling me
one guy killed eight of my men tonight?

604
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:17.201
Eight at Sal's place, four at that kid Rasul's.

605
00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:21.000
We have no merchandise on the street at all?

606
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:22.247
Right.

607
00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:27.085
- One guy?
- I think.

608
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:31.465
Man, if you're right, we're gonna look like
the biggest bunch of pussies in New York.

609
00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:33.471
What do you want me to do?

610
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:39.261
I want Kick-Ass's fucking head
on a stick, and I want it now.

611
00:44:49.103 --> 00:44:51.151
I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.

612
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.155
Good move, Ass-Kick. Let's keep it that way.

613
00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:57.994
You know what this is?

614
00:44:59.113 --> 00:45:02.663
It's all the cartridge crap that comes out
of your gay little Taser when you fire it.

615
00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:05.962
You do know the police could have traced
this right back to you if they'd found it?

616
00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:09.211
But lucky for you, I picked it up.

617
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:11.876
Thank you.

618
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.885
Let's call it insurance.
Makes it easier for us to take your word.

619
00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:20.138
See, we like you, but we don't trust you.

620
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:24.143
Don't take it personal, though.
We don't trust anybody.

621
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:30.275
I rerouted your IP address.
Finding you was way too easy.

622
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.274
Oh, shit. Shit, I hadn't thought...

623
00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:37.239
My God, I... I owe you.

624
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.160
You know what? I'm thinking of
just shutting my site down anyway.

625
00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:43.583
Quitting. I mean, this is...

626
00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:47.545
It's fucking insane. I'm in way over my head.

627
00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:50.081
It's a shame. You have potential.

628
00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:53.168
Your call,
but you know we're around if you need us.

629
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:56.553
How do I get a hold of you?

630
00:45:56.629 --> 00:46:00.884
You just contact the mayor's office.
He has a special signal he shines in the sky.

631
00:46:00.967 --> 00:46:02.514
It's in the shape of a giant cock.

632
00:46:03.886 --> 00:46:06.309
You need us, put on your website
that you're on vacation.

633
00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:09.518
We'll find you.
Hit Girl, back to headquarters.

634
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.687
Sweet dreams.

635
00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:20.324
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

636
00:46:20.403 --> 00:46:21.905
<i>No. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's up?</i>

637
00:46:21.988 --> 00:46:23.114
What's up?

638
00:46:23.531 --> 00:46:27.206
Kick-Ass is killing my men, Gigante,
that's what's up.

639
00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:28.958
<i>My condolences, Frank.</i>

640
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:32.461
But I'm afraid
I can't help you out on this one.

641
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.417
Little bit outside my jurisdiction.

642
00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:36.260
<i>Outside your jurisdiction?</i>

643
00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:38.546
You're a fucking cop,
and he's breaking the law.

644
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.883
That's so inside your jurisdiction,
it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass.

645
00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:46.058
Listen, cops pay me to nail the bad guys,
you pay me not to.

646
00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.184
<i>Everything else is in the gray area.</i>

647
00:46:48.264 --> 00:46:50.687
Yeah. Fuck you very much, Vic.
Just do it, okay?

648
00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:54.570
Un-fucking-believable.

649
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:57.944
Where's Cody? He's late.

650
00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:02.612
Thank you, Cody.
We appreciate your co-operation.

651
00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:06.582
Let me out now?
I gave you all them names and addresses.

652
00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:08.997
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

653
00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:11.625
You and your crazy midget friend
can go bash whoever you want...

654
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:14.378
Hey, come on.
Hey, I know some very bad people uptown,

655
00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:17.552
really nasty individuals.
Let me go. Hey, come on!

656
00:47:18.044 --> 00:47:20.046
Hey, don't do this!
You don't need to do this!

657
00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:21.722
Come on. Oh, shit...

658
00:47:21.797 --> 00:47:23.765
Please! Hey! God!

659
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:27.849
Don't do this, man!

660
00:47:28.971 --> 00:47:31.941
No, no, no, no. No, please don't do this!

661
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:47.740
What a douche.

662
00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:04.053
You have done self tan before, right?

663
00:48:04.465 --> 00:48:06.809
Yeah, like, I do it all the time.

664
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:11.097
<i>Murder, superheroes
breaking into my bedroom,</i>

665
00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:14.150
<i>my life had turned into some
fucked-up dream I couldn't wake up from.</i>

666
00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:18.820
<i>Even the good parts were totally surreal.</i>

667
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.865
Oh, hey, I read those old
Ditko <i>Spider-Mans</i> you gave me.

668
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:24.319
They're actually pretty good.

669
00:48:24.402 --> 00:48:25.449
Yeah, they are.

670
00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:30.916
And it's been a whole week
since I've heard from Rasul.

671
00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.837
That's great.

672
00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:34.890
<i>Once upon a time, there were
two supercops, called Daddy and Marcus,</i>

673
00:49:35.514 --> 00:49:38.859
<i>who were very good at getting bad guys.</i>

674
00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:42.109
<i>Frank D'Amico
was the baddest guy of them all,</i>

675
00:49:42.188 --> 00:49:45.192
<i>and he came up with a plan
to get rid of Daddy.</i>

676
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:52.331
<i>Being framed as a drug dealer
was the worst possible thing</i>

677
00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:54.784
<i>that could have happened to Daddy.</i>

678
00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.290
<i>Prison was not his natural habitat.</i>

679
00:50:00.372 --> 00:50:02.090
<i>He was very upset.</i>

680
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:09.261
<i>With Daddy in prison,
his pregnant wife was all alone</i>

681
00:50:10.966 --> 00:50:12.718
<i>and could not cope.</i>

682
00:50:15.387 --> 00:50:18.937
<i>But all clouds have a silver lining,
and out of her death,</i>

683
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.988
<i>Mindy was born!</i>

684
00:50:25.606 --> 00:50:28.405
<i>Marcus became the child's guardian,</i>

685
00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:31.454
<i>and Daddy started a plan of his very own.</i>

686
00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:37.623
<i>Five years later, he left prison,
and he was ready.</i>

687
00:50:41.497 --> 00:50:44.967
<i>Now, it was time for Mindy to get ready, too.</i>

688
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.768
How'd you find me, Marcus?

689
00:50:55.344 --> 00:50:57.972
One of us is still a cop, remember?

690
00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:08.403
Is this how you brainwashed Mindy?

691
00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:10.985
You say brainwashed.
I say made it into a game.

692
00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:13.161
You call this playing, Damon?

693
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.324
Vigilante justice, mass murder.
Come on, partner.

694
00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.244
So where is she?

695
00:51:20.786 --> 00:51:22.459
- She's safe.
- Can I see her?

696
00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:25.674
I miss her.

697
00:51:27.459 --> 00:51:29.052
I miss you both.

698
00:51:29.837 --> 00:51:33.341
I appreciate your concern.
But you need to go now.

699
00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:43.063
I should warn you, that asshole Gigante
is looking for Kick-Ass.

700
00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:45.193
He got something to do with you, Damon?

701
00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:48.443
You started some kind of
fucked-up superhero club?

702
00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:52.117
- Never heard of him.
- Okay, well, heads up, all right?

703
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:54.244
You keep carrying on
like you've been carrying on,

704
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.449
it's only a matter of time
before Gigante is looking for you.

705
00:51:57.531 --> 00:52:01.126
He's been on Frank D'Amico's payroll
ever since you passed up the opportunity.

706
00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:04.546
You know I'm not gonna stop.

707
00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:08.967
Not until D'Amico
and his whole damn operation

708
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:12.880
are burnt to ashes and buried.

709
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.558
It ain't gonna bring her back, Damon.

710
00:52:17.843 --> 00:52:20.221
This is not the life for Mindy.

711
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.234
You owe that kid a childhood.

712
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.062
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood!

713
00:52:29.021 --> 00:52:30.694
Frank D'Amico!

714
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.343
Holy shit.

715
00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:56.260
I don't fucking believe it.

716
00:52:59.593 --> 00:53:01.220
Follow him, around the corner.

717
00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:03.689
Not too fast.

718
00:53:06.809 --> 00:53:08.561
What's with the high-fives?

719
00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:11.897
I'll give you a motherfucking high-five.

720
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:15.534
High-fiving bullshit. Keep going, keep going.

721
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.112
Not too close.

722
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:24.414
He's going in the alley.

723
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.836
He's going in the alley.

724
00:53:27.371 --> 00:53:31.126
Okay, when I tell you, stop the car. Ready?

725
00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:36.885
Hey, Kick-Ass.

726
00:53:37.715 --> 00:53:39.183
How you doing?

727
00:53:41.135 --> 00:53:42.478
Kill my men, huh?

728
00:53:42.803 --> 00:53:44.726
Take my fucking coke?

729
00:53:44.805 --> 00:53:46.648
Whoa! Whoa! Boss, what are you doing?

730
00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:48.897
- Boss, we gotta go, man. Come on, let's go.
- Fucking scumbag!

731
00:53:48.976 --> 00:53:51.229
Frank, Frank, Frank, come on,
he's had enough. Come on.

732
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:53.279
He's had enough. Come on.

733
00:53:53.814 --> 00:53:56.363
What the fuck
are you looking at? Huh?

734
00:53:58.277 --> 00:53:59.449
Frank.

735
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:11.465
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, let's go. We gotta go.

736
00:54:12.499 --> 00:54:15.048
Shit. Come on, come on, get in.

737
00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:25.312
<i>He was so young.
No one should have to die that way.</i>

738
00:54:25.387 --> 00:54:28.687
I mean, I just can't believe he's dead,
that's all.

739
00:54:30.392 --> 00:54:33.066
Oh, I know. But, Katie,

740
00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:37.783
guys like Rasul, they get mixed up in stuff...

741
00:54:38.192 --> 00:54:41.571
No, I know, I know.
But what if it was my fault?

742
00:54:41.653 --> 00:54:42.700
What if Kick-Ass did it?

743
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.748
I mean, I feel like
I should call the cops or something.

744
00:54:44.823 --> 00:54:46.621
What? You're talking crazy.

745
00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:49.833
There's no way.
He probably didn't even read your e-mail yet.

746
00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:52.210
- Yeah.
- You've got nothing to worry about.

747
00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:55.793
I'm so glad you're here.

748
00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:57.548
I was such a mess.

749
00:54:58.253 --> 00:54:59.630
That's okay.

750
00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:02.967
- No problem.
- You're the best.

751
00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:09.394
I hope it's okay to say this, but...
It so sucks that you're gay.

752
00:55:13.352 --> 00:55:15.571
I don't fucking believe this.

753
00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:21.823
What kind of
children's enter-fucking-tainer is that?

754
00:55:21.902 --> 00:55:22.903
Huh?

755
00:55:23.111 --> 00:55:28.333
What kind of kid has a... A Spider-Man
party, sure, but a fucking Kick-Ass party?

756
00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:31.127
What, are they selling paper plates
and napkins down at the store now?

757
00:55:31.203 --> 00:55:33.581
Frank, you're scaring me. You're losing it.

758
00:55:33.956 --> 00:55:36.926
Since when did you start getting
your hands dirty again? And in public!

759
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.378
Since when I ask you fucks
to deliver me Kick-Ass,

760
00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:42.840
- and you don't deliver, that's when.
- Hey, give me a break. It's been a week.

761
00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:46.268
We e-mailed him. We got half the crew out
doing petty crimes as bait.

762
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:48.057
We're busting our asses here.

763
00:55:49.137 --> 00:55:51.231
What the hell are you doing?

764
00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:53.058
You're back on the powder now, as well?

765
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:56.020
"Mommy, I want a Kick-Ass party."

766
00:55:56.103 --> 00:55:57.150
Dumb little fucks.

767
00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:01.025
- I know a way you can get him.
- Oh, shit.

768
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:02.701
Chris, how long you been there?

769
00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:04.153
What the hell are you doing?
Get the hell out.

770
00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:05.579
Do you want to hear it or not?

771
00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:08.866
- Hear what?
- Okay, look,

772
00:56:08.949 --> 00:56:11.919
you're a superhero and you're lonely,
but you can't trust anyone

773
00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:13.667
'cause either
they'll expose your secret identity...

774
00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:15.998
Comic books this kid reads
all fucking day long.

775
00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:19.927
The point is there's only one way
a superhero can trust a stranger.

776
00:56:20.002 --> 00:56:23.347
And I can be that stranger.
You just gotta give me a chance.

777
00:56:23.422 --> 00:56:25.470
I know I can do it. I just need a few things.

778
00:56:27.593 --> 00:56:28.640
Like what?

779
00:56:30.637 --> 00:56:32.605
I need these things.

780
00:56:36.685 --> 00:56:38.528
What, are you fucking kidding me?
What the hell is this?

781
00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:40.447
It's everything I need.

782
00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:42.820
And you might have to screw
someone over, like Louie, or something.

783
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.949
- Louie? Oh, hey, Chris.
- Or somebody. It doesn't have to be Louie.

784
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.197
- Tony!
- Tony.

785
00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:50.536
- Tony?
- I hate Tony.

786
00:56:50.616 --> 00:56:52.209
Yeah, fuck Tony. He's a scumbag.

787
00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:55.788
I swear, Dad, if you let me do this,
it's gonna work.

788
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:01.626
Tony.

789
00:57:02.044 --> 00:57:05.264
<i>Tony Romita, one of America's
most-wanted crime kingpins,</i>

790
00:57:05.339 --> 00:57:07.137
<i>was arrested in Queens today</i>

791
00:57:07.215 --> 00:57:10.094
<i>after a 911 call from someone
claiming to be a superhero...</i>

792
00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:12.680
So, how are things going with Katie?

793
00:57:13.847 --> 00:57:15.064
Oh, just peachy.

794
00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:17.317
We had a sleepover
and spent the whole night

795
00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:20.737
watching the entire <i>Ugly Betty</i> box set
and did pedicures.

796
00:57:21.313 --> 00:57:24.192
I'm telling you, the longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

797
00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:28.287
I know. I was gonna tell her.
It's just, she seems so happy.

798
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:30.581
- I don't know when's the right time.
- Now's your chance.

799
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:34.376
- She didn't see that, did she?
- Hey, guys.

800
00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.870
- Hi!
- Hi, sweetie.

801
00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:39.957
Oh, did you watch the TV?
The new superhero guy?

802
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.917
- How cool is that?
- What?

803
00:57:42.084 --> 00:57:44.587
- Hey, look.
- Oh, could you turn it up, please?

804
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:46.092
- Check this out.
<i>- ...dressed as Kick-Ass.</i>

805
00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:51.052
<i>But it seems that far from being put off,
this individual, who calls himself Red Mist,</i>

806
00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.307
<i>has decided to take
crime-fighting to a new level,</i>

807
00:57:53.387 --> 00:57:56.311
<i>as his actions last night proved.
Red Mist, how do you see it?</i>

808
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.314
<i>Well, I guess folks have just
had enough of living in fear, you know,</i>

809
00:57:59.393 --> 00:58:02.192
<i>and Kick-Ass really proved that
one individual can make a difference.</i>

810
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.150
<i>So if anyone out there needs help,
I'll be fighting crime 25/8.</i>

811
00:58:06.274 --> 00:58:09.198
<i>And I'm just one click away. Redmist.org.</i>

812
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:14.367
Can we turn that off now?
What's so special about that guy?

813
00:58:14.449 --> 00:58:17.202
He caught, like, a drug dealer,
some most-wanted guy.

814
00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:19.254
You saw him bringing out like a ton of stuff.

815
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:20.876
That's pretty cool.

816
00:58:21.248 --> 00:58:23.592
He's got a way better costume
than Kick-Ass, too.

817
00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:25.135
- He's got a cape.
- Yeah.

818
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.463
- Capes rock.
- Yeah, I'm kind of feeling the cape.

819
00:58:27.546 --> 00:58:29.264
He looks good.

820
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:32.517
What, better than Kick-Ass?

821
00:58:32.592 --> 00:58:35.516
I mean, they're both kind of hot.
I just think Red Mist has a better body.

822
00:58:35.971 --> 00:58:37.564
Don't you think, Dave?

823
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.563
- Uh...
- Yeah, Dave, what do you think?

824
00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:44.109
Is he the kind of guy you'd go for,
with all that leather?

825
00:58:45.397 --> 00:58:48.617
No, Marty. No, he's not really my type.

826
00:59:42.454 --> 00:59:43.501
Kick-Ass!

827
00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:45.920
Red Mist.

828
00:59:47.459 --> 00:59:49.803
Oh, shit! Fuck me, that kind of hurt.

829
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:53.632
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm cool.

830
00:59:53.799 --> 00:59:56.928
I can't believe you're here, man.
Like, you're my hero.

831
00:59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.347
You inspired me. No Kick-Ass, no Red Mist.

832
01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.357
- Seriously.
- Wow.

833
01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:06.437
- Hey, really?
- Straight up. And listen, if you...

834
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.364
I don't know, if you wanted me
to be your sidekick or something...

835
01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.529
You wanna be my sidekick?

836
01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:15.237
Yeah, man!
You and me together, we would own!

837
01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.739
You wanna go fight some crime?

838
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:19.620
No, I mean, like, right now?

839
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.329
Yeah, man, come on.
I got something I wanna show you.

840
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:25.379
Uh, I mean, like, to be honest with you,

841
01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.254
I only ever fight crime
between like 9:00 and 2:00, weekdays.

842
01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.926
So I'm gonna need to get back pretty soon.

843
01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:31.548
Mmm-hmm.

844
01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.133
Sweet!

845
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.354
- Is that yours?
- Meet the Mist Mobile.

846
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.483
SatNav. Got my iPhone,
so I can check the websites

847
01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.945
for emergencies when I'm driving around.

848
01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:58.906
Got a little bit of mood lighting right there.

849
01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.162
Rearview camera, no big deal.

850
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.585
Check this, you're gonna fucking love this.

851
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.291
The mist.

852
01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:13.969
Hey.

853
01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.930
That's right, we're superheroes. Love us.

854
01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:23.806
- Smoke?
- No.

855
01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:26.688
I feel a little weed takes the edge off things
when I'm on patrol, you know?

856
01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:30.771
Going up against a crowd
can get kind of scary, don't you think?

857
01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.527
Something wrong?

858
01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:38.328
Yeah. You're so not how I expected.

859
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.203
Oh, I got this e-mail from this chick.

860
01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.005
She said this guy's
been following her home from work.

861
01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:52.718
I got her address and stuff.
You wanna check it out?

862
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.965
- Sure, why not?
- Cool.

863
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.558
So we're sitting there
totally naked, right?

864
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.270
I told her, "Sit on my lap, we'll talk about
the first thing that comes up."

865
01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:20.495
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Just got the text. He's on his way.

866
01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.409
<i>You did very good.</i>

867
01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.701
- Don't kill him till I get there.
<i>- Right.</i>

868
01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:34.300
Looks like reading all them comics
paid off, huh?

869
01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.837
Your boy did good, Frankie.

870
01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.595
He's his father's son.

871
01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:53.528
I forgot.

872
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.557
What the fuck?

873
01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.229
Shit.

874
01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:36.275
- Hey, what are you doing?
- There are people in there.

875
01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.823
Yeah. Shouldn't we call the fire...

876
01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:41.734
Shit!

877
01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:01.342
Mikey.

878
01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.258
Fuck.

879
01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.431
- Shit. Fuck.
- Red Mist!

880
01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.936
Red Mist! Red Mist!

881
01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:21.525
Hey. Hey, man, can you hear me? Hey.

882
01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:26.989
Jesus Christ!

883
01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:37.458
Red Mist! Red Mist!

884
01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.047
Where the fuck are you?

885
01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:18.586
We gotta get the hell out of here.
Dude, move your fucking ass!

886
01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:38.940
Holy shit!

887
01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:42.238
- Did you see those bodies?
- Yeah, man.

888
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.865
- Why'd you save the teddy?
- What?

889
01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:50.656
I don't know, man. Come on.

890
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:04.882
Come.

891
01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:07.138
What the hell are you doing, Frank?

892
01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.181
You know I can't be here.
What if somebody saw...

893
01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:11.510
That motherfucker Kick-Ass
burnt down my warehouse

894
01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:13.345
and killed my men, Gigante.

895
01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:15.396
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Kick-Ass?

896
01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.474
- Are you sure?
- You gotta help me, Vic.

897
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.022
My son was there, and he's still missing.

898
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.025
They're all dead!

899
01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:24.947
Everybody in the warehouse is dead.

900
01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.701
Put the gun down, Vic. It's Chris.

901
01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:30.533
Chris is Red Mist?

902
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:33.248
It's not Red Mist you gotta worry about.
It's Kick-Ass.

903
01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:36.167
No, no, no, it's not.
Kick-Ass is just some geek, Dad.

904
01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:39.917
You don't have to worry about him.
You need to watch this.

905
01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:44.005
- Why, what does it do?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

906
01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.711
- What?
- God damn it, just sit down.

907
01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:53.726
What are you doing?
What the hell is that thing?

908
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:56.725
You bought this to spy on the nanny
when I was a kid. Don't you remember?

909
01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:00.108
- What, and you put it in the warehouse?
- Yeah, I thought it'd be cool

910
01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:03.357
to put the unmasking of Kick-Ass
on the Internet, okay?

911
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:04.688
Watch.

912
01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:13.364
<i>I told her, "Sit on my lap, we'll talk about
the first thing that comes up."</i>

913
01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:18.785
<i>- Yeah?
- Just got the text. He's on his way.</i>

914
01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:20.704
<i>You did very good.</i>

915
01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.789
<i>- Don't kill him till I get there.
- Right.</i>

916
01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.540
Who the hell is this guy?

917
01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:41.998
I don't know, Dad.

918
01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:45.330
But Kick-Ass told me
we're not the only superheroes in town.

919
01:08:45.413 --> 01:08:47.290
Maybe he knows who this guy is.

920
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:51.461
I want this place locked down.

921
01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:54.594
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out.

922
01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.176
Not until somebody finds this cocksucker

923
01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:01.388
and pulls his fucking lungs out
through his ass.

924
01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:07.148
<i>Listen, they're on to you.</i>

925
01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:09.604
<i>Do you hear me? They're on to you.</i>

926
01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:12.315
I thought they were looking for Kick-Ass.

927
01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:15.993
<i>Not anymore. Gigante just put on
a little movie-show for us.</i>

928
01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:20.700
Different superhero in a warehouse,
killing a whole bunch of D'Amico's guys.

929
01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:22.875
I'm gonna take a wild guess that was you.

930
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.459
- I killed all the cameras.
<i>- Apparently not.</i>

931
01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:29.586
Look, bro, you need to get ghost.
Hide yourself quick.

932
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:31.467
Appreciate it.

933
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.052
Mindy,

934
01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.426
no more homework, baby doll.

935
01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:43.184
It's time for Frank D'Amico to go bye-bye.

936
01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:56.284
<i>X-Men, the Fantastic Four,
right now, I envy the crap out of them.</i>

937
01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:01.577
<i>Everything was out of control.
I didn't know what the hell to do.</i>

938
01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:06.002
You okay, buddy? You look tired.
Early night tonight, maybe?

939
01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:07.920
<i>And there was no one I could talk to about it.</i>

940
01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:09.793
Dave? Hello?

941
01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.083
Yeah, you bet I will.

942
01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.137
<i>I'd never felt more alone.</i>

943
01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:25.473
<i>I'd always dreamed of being a superhero,
but this was a nightmare.</i>

944
01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:33.105
<i>It was time to stop wearing
this stupid costume.</i>

945
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.653
<i>But there was one last thing I needed it for.</i>

946
01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:45.493
<i>What's the difference between
Spider-Man and Peter Parker?</i>

947
01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:48.669
<i>Spider-Man gets the girl.</i>

948
01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:58.596
Hey, I'm Kick-Ass.

949
01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.432
I'm Kick-Ass. You mail me?

950
01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.018
Wait...

951
01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:11.146
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

952
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:14.445
Fucking freak in a mask!
Get out of my house!

953
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.363
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

954
01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.316
No, no, no! It's me, it's me!

955
01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:21.073
All right?
I was only trying to surprise you. I'm...

956
01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:23.530
- Dave? What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

957
01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.537
- Why are you dressed as Kick-Ass?
- Because I am Kick-Ass.

958
01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:30.708
- What are you talking about?
- And I'm also not Gay.

959
01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.332
- Fuck!
- And I'm an idiot and a shit friend.

960
01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:36.008
I lied to you, I know.

961
01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.506
- Oh, my God.
- I know. If it makes you feel any better,

962
01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:42.716
I don't think you can hate me any more
right now than I hate myself.

963
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.972
Please, I'm...

964
01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:48.271
Look, I'm really, really sorry.

965
01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:56.154
I've never met anyone who's as beautiful
and as kind and lovely as you.

966
01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.235
You deserve better.

967
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.672
- Dave.
- Yes?

968
01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:26.013
My mom has the burglar alarm on downstairs,

969
01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.766
so you should probably use the window.

970
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.476
Or...

971
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:41.858
Or you could just stay.

972
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.618
Stay?

973
01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:46.905
What, like when we have a sleepover?

974
01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.627
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

975
01:12:58.708 --> 01:12:59.834
Wow.

976
01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:31.408
We gotta get over it,

977
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:35.336
on top of it, and then into it,
right in the middle of it.

978
01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.254
Daddy, I think I found one.

979
01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.675
It's perfect,
and they can deliver it in three days.

980
01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:44.219
Uh, it's 300,000 bucks.

981
01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:46.343
Can you think of anything else
you'd rather spend it on?

982
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.675
Oh, my gosh!

983
01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:52.182
- That is cool.
- Yeah.

984
01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.314
Add to shopping cart.

985
01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:56.773
Okay.

986
01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:02.564
Out of Kick-Ass and Red Mist,
who do you think would win in a fight?

987
01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:06.068
Why are they fighting? That seems stupid.

988
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.279
- What do you think?
- I don't know, but I think Kick-Ass is cuter.

989
01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.364
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

990
01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:15.998
I, for one, would definitely
fuck his brains out if I got the chance.

991
01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:19.167
You would?

992
01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:20.372
Definitely.

993
01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:24.215
Do you feel like checking out
that new Kate Hudson movie

994
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.045
where she's like a shoe designer,
can't get a guy?

995
01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.675
- I think we could make the next showing.
- Hell, yeah.

996
01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.765
I guess we're not invited.

997
01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:36.435
All right. You know what? Come here.

998
01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:39.393
I'm going to convert you
to a comics reader right now.

999
01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:43.985
<i>Suddenly, I understood why
superheroes only existed in comic books.</i>

1000
01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:47.408
<i>I got why people didn't risk their lives
for strangers.</i>

1001
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.827
<i>Because for the first time in my life,</i>

1002
01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.325
<i>I had something worth living for,</i>

1003
01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.078
<i>something to lose.</i>

1004
01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:58.161
<i>Katie worried about me getting hurt,</i>

1005
01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:00.963
<i>so I promised her
my Kick-Ass days were over.</i>

1006
01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:04.087
<i>And the truth was I hardly missed it at all.</i>

1007
01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:07.216
<i>I hadn't even checked
the website for, like, a week.</i>

1008
01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.683
- Okay, I'm off then.
- Mmm-hmm.

1009
01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:15.929
- No Katie tonight?
- Tomorrow.

1010
01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:19.432
Wednesdays, she's got
one of those volunteer things.

1011
01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:22.314
You seem like a different guy,
you know that?

1012
01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:26.523
Your mom would have been so happy
to see you out of your shell like this.

1013
01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.278
Have a good night.

1014
01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:41.541
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Hey, what's going on?</i>

1015
01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:43.790
I gotta do a Kick-Ass thing.

1016
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.588
What? I thought you were done with that.

1017
01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.840
<i>This is the last time. I totally swear.</i>

1018
01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:51.256
I worry about you.

1019
01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:54.467
Well, I wish you wouldn't worry.

1020
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.302
<i>I can't help it. I do because I...</i>

1021
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.564
I care about you a lot.

1022
01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.774
I care about you a lot, too.

1023
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.185
This better be pretty serious, dude,

1024
01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.683
'cause I promised my girlfriend
that I'm done with all this shit.

1025
01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:43.357
How about both of us being dead?
Is that serious enough for you?

1026
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.360
Dead? How?

1027
01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.775
It turns out
those dead guys from the warehouse

1028
01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:52.279
had some bad motherfuckers for friends,
and they think we did that shit.

1029
01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.406
There's a price on our heads, man.

1030
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:56.738
A price on our heads?
What is this, the Wild West?

1031
01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:59.620
I'm not messing with you, dude.
They found out where I lived.

1032
01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.416
They trashed my place. I'm fucking screwed.

1033
01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:04.166
- And you're gonna be next, okay?
- All right. What?

1034
01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:08.499
Shit.

1035
01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.089
What do we do?

1036
01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:16.924
Remember you mentioned
that there are other superheroes?

1037
01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:18.384
Yeah?

1038
01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:21.061
Well, do you think they can help us?

1039
01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.430
Uh...

1040
01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.819
Hot chocolate, extra marshmallows.

1041
01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:39.330
Man, that looks even cooler
than it did in the picture.

1042
01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:43.751
Child, you know, that's because
in the picture, it didn't have Gatling guns.

1043
01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:45.328
Nice job.

1044
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.254
I'm gonna take mine to bed, okay?

1045
01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:49.707
Okay, baby doll. Sleep tight.

1046
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.339
Thanks. Kick-Ass?

1047
01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:53.670
Mmm-hmm.

1048
01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:56.346
You go get dressed.
I'll tell him to meet us at Safe House B.

1049
01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.595
We'll have our hot chocolate
when we get back.

1050
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.551
- Okay, Daddy.
- Come on.

1051
01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.316
- There you go.
- All right.

1052
01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.023
- Do you know where that is?
- No, but I'll just put it in the GPS.

1053
01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:16.655
- It's what it's for.
- All right, let's go.

1054
01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:18.994
Shit.

1055
01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.584
Okay, okay, okay.

1056
01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:09.059
Well, here you are and Red Mist, too.

1057
01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.983
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you, sir.

1058
01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:18.564
Please, come in.

1059
01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.033
After you.

1060
01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.238
Hit Girl, manners, honey.

1061
01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.660
Hi, I'm Hit Girl.

1062
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.662
No!

1063
01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:37.632
No!

1064
01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.674
Your ass is mine! Come on.

1065
01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:43.176
No, he's with me. He's okay.

1066
01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:45.724
Shut the fuck up, kid.
Your daddy's the boss. You go home.

1067
01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:49.099
Are you shitting me? No, he's fine.
He's with me.

1068
01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:50.433
Let him go.

1069
01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.264
Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

1070
01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.191
Hot damn. I always wanted one of these.

1071
01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.984
- You're seriously gonna take that?
- Yes.

1072
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.107
Come on, sweet cheeks.

1073
01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.280
If you don't get your
wannabe superhero ass in the car...

1074
01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:04.861
- That's funny.
- ...you're gonna have a lot of trouble

1075
01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:06.820
- on your hands.
- That's really funny. You're so fired.

1076
01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:09.453
- Kick-Ass...
- Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

1077
01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.784
- Get him in the van.
- Let go of me. Put me down.

1078
01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.460
Kick-Ass, I'm sorry!

1079
01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.171
- Get in the car.
- Get in there!

1080
01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:31.061
You better fire this asshole.

1081
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:32.763
Ignore him...

1082
01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:34.598
A bazooka?

1083
01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:39.737
- Okay.
- We had a deal, Dad.

1084
01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:42.486
We had a fucking deal
that I would get you the guy who did it,

1085
01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:46.239
and all I'm asking is you let Kick-Ass go.
He didn't do anything wrong.

1086
01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:49.948
Chris, you got to look at this
from my point of view. Okay?

1087
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.704
I gotta send a public service message
to the people out there

1088
01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:55.752
that being a superhero is bad for your health.

1089
01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:58.456
And the big motherfucker?
Nobody knows who he is.

1090
01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:02.089
- Yeah, but that's not fair!
- Yeah, life's not fair, kid. Get over it.

1091
01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.544
What are you gonna do to them?

1092
01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.759
You really wanna be a part of my business?

1093
01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:10.555
Yeah.

1094
01:22:10.634 --> 01:22:13.808
Then sit down, shut up and watch.

1095
01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:25.908
<i>Frank, we're ready. Enjoy the show.</i>

1096
01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:28.111
- Are you controlling this right now?
- I sure am.

1097
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.537
<i>Big Brother</i>, watch and learn.

1098
01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:32.618
<i>Welcome back. Breaking News.</i>

1099
01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:35.372
<i>A worldwide web broadcast
of the New York superhero</i>

1100
01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.796
<i>who calls himself Kick-Ass
is about to be shown live.</i>

1101
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:41.715
<i>Rumors have it that
this will be Kick-Ass's farewell appearance,</i>

1102
01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:44.210
<i>that he will announce
his retirement from crime fighting.</i>

1103
01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:46.758
<i>But as word of mouth continues to spread,</i>

1104
01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.305
<i>Internet providers are predicting that</i>

1105
01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:52.010
<i>it could be one of the most widely-viewed
live events in web history.</i>

1106
01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:53.643
Wait, where's Dave?

1107
01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:55.687
<i>There are no clues as yet
as to the exact nature...</i>

1108
01:22:55.762 --> 01:22:58.641
- Holy shit. Have you guys noticed...
- He's with Katie.

1109
01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.852
- Obviously.
<i>- ...come to a standstill to watch.</i>

1110
01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:02.527
Why else would I be here?

1111
01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:05.982
<i>There's no idea as to who is behind
the broadcast of this show,</i>

1112
01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:08.613
<i>but we could see
widespread server crashes...</i>

1113
01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:11.570
Dave, why didn't you tell me
this is what you were doing?

1114
01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.530
You're on the news. Call me.

1115
01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:17.084
<i>We go now over live to the countdown
clock as we are moments away.</i>

1116
01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:30.840
Show time.

1117
01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:34.802
<i>Hello, boys and girls.</i>

1118
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.762
<i>Now, this...</i>

1119
01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:39.473
<i>Well, you know who this guy is.</i>

1120
01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:42.400
<i>And this guy here is Big Daddy.</i>

1121
01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:45.191
And these are my friends.

1122
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:47.364
Come on in, guys, say hello.

1123
01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.784
Yeah, yeah, there they are. Hello, hello.

1124
01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:54.454
Now Big Daddy and Kick-Ass
are gonna help us

1125
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:59.081
<i>show you why being a hero is a bad idea.</i>

1126
01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:00.961
<i>You know what a silent "K" is?</i>

1127
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.376
That's when "K" is
at the beginning of the word,

1128
01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.254
but you don't pronounce it.
Like in the word "Knuckleduster."

1129
01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:08.882
Show them what a knuckleduster can do, guy.

1130
01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:10.717
<i>Oh, that must have hurt!</i>

1131
01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.048
Let's see that again from the other side.

1132
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.508
Go on. Yeah, I think it did.

1133
01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:19.017
<i>Now in France, they say the word "stick"</i>
<i>like this</i>, bâton.

1134
01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.981
We got some of Kick-Ass's <i>bâtons.</i>

1135
01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.605
We're gonna show you what they can do.
Go ahead, boys.

1136
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:30.403
<i>In America, we say "stick" like this.
Baseball bat.</i>

1137
01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:35.658
Which is very good
for hitting knees and stomachs.

1138
01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:38.286
It's also good for hitting balls.

1139
01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:41.327
<i>Know what else we do?
We don't do them individually.</i>

1140
01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:45.373
We do them all together. Gentlemen, please.

1141
01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:48.504
Yeah. Oh, this looks very painful.

1142
01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:54.257
<i>Due to
the distressing nature of the images,</i>

1143
01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:58.094
<i>we are unable to broadcast the events
currently streaming live on the Internet.</i>

1144
01:24:58.176 --> 01:25:00.395
- Fuck.
- No. No, no, no.

1145
01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:04.061
<i>Despite initial speculation</i>

1146
01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:06.690
<i>that this may be
some kind of hoax or publicity stunt,</i>

1147
01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:10.022
<i>it is now clear that the hostages
are in genuine danger,</i>

1148
01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:14.531
<i>that all signs point to the intention to stage
a live execution in the next few minutes.</i>

1149
01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:32.212
<i>Even with my metal plates
and my fucked-up nerve endings,</i>

1150
01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:34.968
<i>I got to tell you, that hurt.</i>

1151
01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:38.843
<i>The kerosene.</i>

1152
01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:40.678
<i>Yes, the silent killer.</i>

1153
01:25:40.761 --> 01:25:44.641
<i>But not half as much as the idea
of leaving everything behind.</i>

1154
01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:46.441
<i>Katie,</i>

1155
01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:47.813
<i>my dad,</i>

1156
01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:49.812
<i>Todd and Marty.</i>

1157
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:54.400
<i>And all the things I'd never do,
like learn to drive,</i>

1158
01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:57.661
<i>or see what me and Katie's kids
would look like</i>

1159
01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.659
<i>or find out what happened on</i> Lost.

1160
01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:00.830
Spicy, spicy.

1161
01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:02.499
<i>And if you're reassuring yourself</i>

1162
01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:05.748
<i>that I'm gonna make it through this
since I'm talking to you now,</i>

1163
01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.421
<i>quit being such a smartass.</i>

1164
01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:14.591
<i>Hell, dude, you never seen</i> Sin City,
Sunset Blvd., American Beauty?

1165
01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:18.594
And this, for all you cavemen out there,

1166
01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:21.263
is fire.

1167
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.432
No.

1168
01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:30.439
I know.

1169
01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:32.570
<i>Fire. Fire is good.</i>

1170
01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:36.154
Fire is our friend.

1171
01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:38.444
Yeah, yeah.

1172
01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:45.788
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

1173
01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.497
time to die.

1174
01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:56.466
What the...

1175
01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:04.974
What the fuck just happened?
Hey, hey. Somebody find the lights.

1176
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:06.642
Hello!

1177
01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:09.148
Jimmy.

1178
01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:19.326
Jesus Christ.

1179
01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:22.321
Bobby? Bobby?

1180
01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:57.189
Get the lighter!

1181
01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.655
It's on the floor
right over there. Find the lighter.

1182
01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:07.700
I got it.

1183
01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:24.716
- No!
- Take cover, child.

1184
01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:33.977
Now switch to Kryptonite.

1185
01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:35.769
Kryptonite.

1186
01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:09.103
Go to Robin's Revenge!

1187
01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:10.929
Robin, Robin.

1188
01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.604
<i>Show's over, motherfuckers.</i>

1189
01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:05.780
Yeah! I think I'm in love with her, dude.

1190
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.620
She looks like she's about 11 years old, but...

1191
01:30:08.695 --> 01:30:12.040
I can wait!
I solemnly vow to save myself for her.

1192
01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:16.248
That should be really difficult for you.
Are you okay?

1193
01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:18.584
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

1194
01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.437
Good job.

1195
01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:49.369
I'm so proud of you, baby doll.

1196
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:53.532
Are you okay?

1197
01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:58.287
Uh-huh.

1198
01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:02.549
But getting shot, Daddy,
it hurt a lot more than when you did it.

1199
01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:08.172
That's 'cause I used
low velocity rounds, child.

1200
01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:14.891
You're the kindest daddy in the whole world.

1201
01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:16.975
No, I just...

1202
01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:21.393
I love you.

1203
01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:28.025
I love you, too, Daddy.

1204
01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:38.084
I love you, too, Daddy.

1205
01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:41.041
Sleep tight.

1206
01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:01.517
What's your name?

1207
01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.273
I mean your real name.

1208
01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:07.238
A superhero never reveals his true identity.

1209
01:32:07.313 --> 01:32:09.941
What? Look, you can't go on...

1210
01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:13.741
However you lived before,

1211
01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:18.449
it's over.

1212
01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:23.748
Is there anybody else? Your family or...

1213
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:26.174
Look, I can take care of myself.

1214
01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:28.668
I saved your sorry ass.

1215
01:32:29.586 --> 01:32:33.557
What about money, huh?
All right, 'cause you got to think long term.

1216
01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:36.259
I've got $3 million in a suitcase.

1217
01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:39.763
That "long term" enough for you?

1218
01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:44.734
It's not all about the money.

1219
01:32:46.019 --> 01:32:47.362
I owe you.

1220
01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:51.241
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead.

1221
01:32:52.275 --> 01:32:54.323
And if it wasn't for you,

1222
01:32:55.779 --> 01:32:56.996
my dad wouldn't be.

1223
01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:15.598
Look,

1224
01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:20.224
pack up whatever you need
and we'll go back to my place.

1225
01:33:21.638 --> 01:33:23.686
I just need to clean my...

1226
01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:25.479
Just go.

1227
01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:23.624
Whoa! I meant like pajamas
and clothes and stuff.

1228
01:34:23.867 --> 01:34:25.369
You can't take that stuff to my house.

1229
01:34:25.577 --> 01:34:27.250
You know what my dad
really would have wanted?

1230
01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:35.842
He would have wanted me
to finish what we started.

1231
01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:38.715
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1232
01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:58.360
Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

1233
01:34:59.027 --> 01:35:00.700
All that security?

1234
01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:02.618
Are you crazy?

1235
01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.249
My mom already died for nothing.

1236
01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:09.041
So I'm sure as hell
not gonna let my dad die for nothing, too.

1237
01:35:11.414 --> 01:35:12.916
You can't do this on your own.

1238
01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:16.257
Exactly.

1239
01:35:19.339 --> 01:35:20.966
Do you wanna deal with owing my dad?

1240
01:35:23.092 --> 01:35:25.311
Then shut the hell up and pick your weapon.

1241
01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:35.981
Is that what I think it is?

1242
01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:38.950
Damn straight.

1243
01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:41.574
And you better start reading the instructions,

1244
01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:45.078
'cause you're gonna be
using it in about five minutes.

1245
01:35:52.247 --> 01:35:55.501
Yo, listen up. We got five minutes,
then I want you back on your posts.

1246
01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:57.335
And don't leave a mess.

1247
01:36:12.058 --> 01:36:14.982
- Everything okay?
- Everything's all right, boss.

1248
01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:18.648
I can't believe I got my gun back.
Look at that.

1249
01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:20.988
You know, it's not the...

1250
01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:26.539
Let her in.

1251
01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:32.378
It's a little kid. What's the matter with you?

1252
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.843
You okay, sweetheart?

1253
01:36:39.002 --> 01:36:40.049
I...

1254
01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:42.589
I lost my mommy and daddy.

1255
01:36:43.339 --> 01:36:44.886
She lost her mommy and daddy.

1256
01:36:46.342 --> 01:36:48.561
You want to use my cell phone?

1257
01:36:49.554 --> 01:36:51.898
Now can you remember the number?

1258
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:02.241
Help!

1259
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.978
<i>Had I ever been a real superhero?</i>

1260
01:37:38.936 --> 01:37:41.530
<i>The most I'd ever had to offer the world
was good intentions</i>

1261
01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:44.906
<i>and a slightly elevated capacity
to take a kicking.</i>

1262
01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:50.240
<i>With no power comes no responsibility.</i>

1263
01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:54.749
<i>Except that wasn't true.</i>

1264
01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:44.134
- You hear that?
- Holy shit.

1265
01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:45.837
Take cover, please.

1266
01:40:11.088 --> 01:40:12.305
Shit.

1267
01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:14.304
No.

1268
01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:17.477
Shit.

1269
01:40:20.598 --> 01:40:22.100
What the fuck?

1270
01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:27.772
Get in here. Help me out!

1271
01:40:33.736 --> 01:40:36.330
Holy fuck, Fashion, everybody's dead.

1272
01:40:38.533 --> 01:40:40.501
She's behind the counter.
She's out of ammo, okay?

1273
01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:58.387
Do you think they got them?

1274
01:40:58.469 --> 01:40:59.516
If they didn't, he will.

1275
01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:02.814
Get out there.

1276
01:41:03.015 --> 01:41:04.062
Now?

1277
01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:05.647
Yeah, now.

1278
01:41:16.487 --> 01:41:17.739
What the fuck is going on?

1279
01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:19.495
We got her trapped. She's unarmed.

1280
01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:21.042
So what in the hell are you guys waiting for?

1281
01:41:22.118 --> 01:41:23.745
- Go get her.
- Go on, man.

1282
01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:25.705
- Go get her.
- I ain't got no fucking gun.

1283
01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:27.415
I'm not going in.

1284
01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:30.460
You do now.

1285
01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:32.754
Now move.

1286
01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:55.660
Fuck this shit. I'm getting the bazooka.

1287
01:41:58.029 --> 01:41:59.076
Bazooka?

1288
01:41:59.697 --> 01:42:00.789
Bazooka?

1289
01:42:02.241 --> 01:42:04.744
It's only me, boss.
Everything's under control.

1290
01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:21.386
Under control? You're grabbing
a fucking bazooka, you dumbass.

1291
01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:24.101
Sir?

1292
01:42:26.474 --> 01:42:27.646
Do it.

1293
01:42:49.038 --> 01:42:50.255
I always wanted to say this.

1294
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.549
Say hello to my little friend!

1295
01:43:27.076 --> 01:43:28.498
Dirty motherfuckers!

1296
01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:55.988
Holy shit.

1297
01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:06.908
That is one weird-sounding bazooka.

1298
01:44:06.991 --> 01:44:08.083
Stu!

1299
01:44:13.664 --> 01:44:14.790
Fuck!

1300
01:44:24.884 --> 01:44:26.136
Get him.

1301
01:44:35.394 --> 01:44:36.646
Playtime's over, kid.

1302
01:44:38.397 --> 01:44:40.024
I never play.

1303
01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:42.026
Oh, really?

1304
01:46:00.437 --> 01:46:01.780
Ruin my business, huh?

1305
01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:06.615
Kill every single fucking guy on my payroll?

1306
01:46:36.557 --> 01:46:38.605
God, I wish I had a son like you.

1307
01:46:45.524 --> 01:46:47.572
Time for a family reunion.

1308
01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.362
Hey.

1309
01:46:51.113 --> 01:46:54.037
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

1310
01:47:13.218 --> 01:47:15.220
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1311
01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:18.186
Time to go home.

1312
01:48:55.237 --> 01:48:56.534
Thanks, Kick-Ass.

1313
01:48:57.072 --> 01:48:58.449
My daddy,

1314
01:49:01.035 --> 01:49:03.129
he would have been proud of both of us.

1315
01:49:13.672 --> 01:49:14.719
Dave.

1316
01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.267
Dave Lizewski.

1317
01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:18.931
I know that, dumbass.

1318
01:49:30.314 --> 01:49:31.486
Mindy.

1319
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.652
Mindy Macready.

1320
01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:53.003
- Have a good day. Bye.
- Bye.

1321
01:49:55.756 --> 01:49:58.805
<i>Mindy moved in with Marcus,
and he enrolled her at my school.</i>

1322
01:49:58.884 --> 01:50:00.511
- Bye.
- Good luck.

1323
01:50:01.553 --> 01:50:05.433
<i>First school she'd ever been to,
on the promise that I'd look out for her.</i>

1324
01:50:06.683 --> 01:50:07.650
Hey.

1325
01:50:07.726 --> 01:50:09.228
<i>Not that she needed me to.</i>

1326
01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:10.779
Hey, new kid.

1327
01:50:11.105 --> 01:50:12.197
Hi.

1328
01:50:12.689 --> 01:50:14.111
Lunch money.

1329
01:50:14.691 --> 01:50:15.783
Now.

1330
01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.294
<i>Kick-Ass was gone, but not forgotten.</i>

1331
01:50:27.412 --> 01:50:30.586
<i>And my world was much safer
with all the new superheroes.</i>

1332
01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:34.048
<i>They said I was their inspiration,</i>

1333
01:50:34.545 --> 01:50:37.298
<i>but all I did was make a door
into a world I'd dreamed about</i>

1334
01:50:37.381 --> 01:50:39.349
<i>since I was a little kid.</i>

1335
01:50:40.008 --> 01:50:42.431
A world full of superheroes, huh?

1336
01:50:44.805 --> 01:50:46.853
As a great man once said,

1337
01:50:49.726 --> 01:50:52.149
"Wait till they get a load of me."
