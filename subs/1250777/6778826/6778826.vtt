MAN 2: Protecting us
against the forces of evil.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.390
MAN 3: The superpowers
of this man...

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.460
MAN 4: He can
catch a bullet,

5
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.890
halt a speeding train.

6
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.290
MAN 5: And leap tall
buildings in a single bound.

7
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.560
Up in the sky...

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.560
MAN 6: Is it a bird?

MAN 12: He has powers
far beyond the capabilities
of mere earthlings.

16
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
NARRATOR: I always
wondered why nobody
did it before me.

17
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520
I mean, all those
comic books, movies,
TV shows,

18
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050
you'd think that
one eccentric loner

19
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.890
would have made
himself a costume.

20
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.660
I mean, is everyday life
really so exciting?

21
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.480
Are schools and offices
so thrilling

22
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.960
that I'm the only one
who ever fantasized
about this?

23
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.640
Come on,
be honest with yourself.

24
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.390
At some point in our lives,
we all wanted to
be a superhero.

25
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.800
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

26
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.910
That's not me, by the way.

27
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.050
That's some Armenian guy
with a history of
mental health problems.

28
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.780
Who am I? I'm Kick-Ass.

29
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.710
That's me,
back before any of
this crazy shit happened.

30
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.420
I guess I was
the last person you'd expect
to become a superhero.

31
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.520
I'm not saying
there was anything
wrong with me,

32
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.310
but there was
nothing special, either.

33
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.440
GIRL: Asshole.

34
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.440
I wasn't into sports.

35
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.930
I wasn't a mathlete
or a hardcore gamer.

36
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.850
I didn't have a piercing
or an eating disorder

37
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.590
or 3,000 friends on MySpace.

38
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.860
My only superpower
was being invisible
to girls.

39
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.030
And out of my friends, man,
I wasn't even the funny one.

40
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.860
Like most people my age,
I just existed.

41
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.530
Good morning,
class.

42
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.150
Please open
your books to
Act 2, Scene 2.

43
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.020
DAVE: Kick in
my bedroom door, and you'd
probably find me watching TV

44
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.040
or talking to
my friend Todd
on Skype...

45
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.660
Are you watching
Family Guy?

46
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.660
Nope.

47
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.480
Me, either.
Check out nippleslip.com.
It's good.

48
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.850
DAVE: ...or jerking off,
mostly to my English teacher.

49
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.940
Dave Lizewski.

50
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.730
Don't think I haven't
noticed you looking
at my tits, Dave.

51
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.830
(MOANS) I want
your hands
all over me, Dave.

52
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.950
Please.

53
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.500
DAVE: Sure, a lot of
what got me through
the average school day

54
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.040
was making deposits
in the whack-off
warehouse for later.

55
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.960
Though to be honest,

56
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.020
it didn't take
much to set me off.

57
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.890
I swear,
when my hormones
balance out,

58
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.250
shares in Kleenex
are gonna take
a dive, man.

59
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.590
Dave Lizewski,
shouldn't you be looking
at Hamlet right now?

60
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.820
Yes, Mrs. Zane.

61
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.280
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.960
DAVE: But don't
get me wrong.

63
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.750
I like girls
my own age, too.

64
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.850
Especially Katie Deauxma.

65
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920
Hey, gorgeous.

66
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.820
Hey.

67
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.340
(CHUCKLES)

68
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.380
Oh, no.

69
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.930
You meant Erika.
I know. I knew that.

70
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.130
I was just kidding.

71
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.530
Okay, cool.

72
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.540
Oh, my God.

73
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.660
(BOTH GIGGLING)

74
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.780
Hey. Look,
I'm Todd's mom.

75
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.280
(CHUCKLES)

76
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.830
That's funny.
This is your dad.

77
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.650
No, that's still
my mom, actually.

78
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.930
(LAUGHS)

79
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.070
What the fuck!

80
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.310
DAVE: I was just
a regular guy.

81
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.940
No radioactive spiders,
no refugee status
from a doomed alien world.

82
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.210
You know what?
Todd said they do still
make Count Chocula.

83
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.580
They just don't sell it
at the store anymore.

84
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.090
DAVE: My mother was
killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen...

85
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.960
Mom?

86
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.960
...as opposed to
a gunman in the alley.

87
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.040
So if you were
hoping for any,

88
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.500
"I will avenge you,
Mother!"

89
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.880
you're out of luck.

90
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.770
In the 18 months
since my mother died,

91
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.140
the only epiphany I had

92
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.140
Did they change
the bee's face?

93
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.270
No.

94
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.980
How come nobody's
ever tried to be
a superhero?

95
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.370
MARTY: Boy,
I don't know.

96
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.420
Probably 'cause it's
fucking impossible, dipshit.

97
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.570
What, putting on a mask
and helping people?
How's that impossible?

98
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.010
That's not
superhero, though.
How is that super?

99
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.560
Super's like
being stronger
than everybody

100
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.430
and flying and shit.
That's just hero.

101
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.420
No, it's not even hero.
It's just fucking psycho.

102
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.650
Mmm.

103
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.950
Hello? Bruce Wayne?
He didn't have any powers.

104
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.420
Yes, but he had all
the expensive shit
that doesn't exist.

105
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.730
I thought you meant,
like, "How come nobody
does it in real life?"

106
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.390
Yeah, Todd,
that's what I meant.

107
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.850
Dude, if anybody
did it in real life,
they'd get their ass kicked.

108
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.010
They'd be dead in,
like, a day.

109
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.010
A day.

110
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.870
Yeah, okay,
I'm not saying
they should do it.

111
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.270
I just can't figure out
why nobody does.

112
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.920
Seriously, out of all
the millions of people
who love superheroes,

113
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.830
you'd think one
would give it a try.

114
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.030
Jesus, guys,
does it not bug you?

115
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.180
Why thousands of people
wanna be Paris Hilton

116
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.630
and nobody wants
to be Spider-Man?

117
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.270
Yeah, what's with that?
She has, like,
no tits at all.

118
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.940
Maybe it's the porn tape.
He doesn't have
a porn tape.

119
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.710
You guys never saw
One Night in Spider-Man?

120
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.110
(LAUGHING)

121
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.580
(EXCLAIMS)
Guess who?

122
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.350
Is it me or do you
kind of feel sorry
for Chris D'Amico?

123
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.300
Yeah, it must be terrible
to have a rich dad
and everything you want.

124
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.300
I wish you wouldn't
have said anything

125
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.640
cause I feel like
I'm gonna start crying.

126
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.970
Right.

127
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.580
The fact that he's
always on his own?

128
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.350
We should, like, talk
to him. See if he wants
to hang out with us.

129
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.270
I didn't say we should
talk to him. I just...

130
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.170
Think about it.
Come on, it'd
be awesome.

131
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.890
If he was our friend,
no one would ever
fuck with us again.

132
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.270
Well, go on then,
Todd. You wanna...

133
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.590
I can get up.

134
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.590
No, no...

135
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.390
You wanna go
talk to him?
I can move.

136
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.760
Dave...
Dave should go.

137
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.240
Dave should go.

138
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.240
Why?

139
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.650
Dave, you should
totally go.

140
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.650
Go.

141
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.500
You're a dick.

142
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.500
Don't be afraid, Dave.

143
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.130
You're a pussy.

144
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.490
Fuck off.

145
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.460
(BOTH LAUGHING)

146
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.900
MARTY: Did you spray
anything over there?

147
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.070
Yeah, I think
I might have just shat
in my pants a little.

148
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.200
See you later.

149
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.200
God, see you.

150
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.840
If that guy would
have spoken to me

151
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.110
like that,
I would have
kicked his ass.

152
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.210
Todd, when have you ever
kicked anyone's ass?

153
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.010
Whatever, man.
I would have just
gone for his knees.

154
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.130
You're not
making sense.

155
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.560
What I'm saying is
the centrifugal force

156
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.070
of Batman's batarang
would undoubtedly

157
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.800
penetrate the Joker's
force field,

158
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.140
leaving him totally
vulnerable to the...

159
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.140
All right...

160
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.250
THUG: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

161
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.390
Pussy patrol.

162
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.390
Fuck.

163
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.770
Phones, money.

164
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.130
Dude, not again,
come on.

165
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.900
Phone.

166
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.900
TODD: I don't have one.

167
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.510
Someone else
jacked it last week.

168
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.770
Pussy.

169
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.970
Give me the bag.

170
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.330
It's just comics.

171
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.250
Yo, you want
to get cut?

asshole just watching.

173
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.890
Come on, be honest
with yourself.

174
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.080
Would you do
anything differently?

175
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.180
We see someone in trouble
and we wish we could help,

176
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.800
but we don't.

177
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.410
The world I lived in,
heroes only existed
in comic books.

178
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.730
And I guess that
would have been okay

179
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.930
if bad guys
were make-believe, too.

180
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.270
But they're not.

181
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.600
TRE: Frankie,
I'm telling you, man,

182
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.170
I swear I'm not
making this up.

183
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.490
This fucking guy
comes out of nowhere,
kicks our asses,

184
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.560
and steals
all the coke.

185
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.460
FRANK: This would be
the guy that looks
like Batman?

186
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.210
I didn't say he
looked like Batman.

187
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.130
You did, Tre.
You said the guy
looked like Batman.

188
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.270
He said like
a mask and stuff.

189
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.270
And a cape.

190
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.500
Yeah, like Batman.

191
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.500
TRE: I didn't say
"Like Batman."

192
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.220
I never said "Batman."

193
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.380
Okay.

194
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.410
Let me tell you
the problem I got
with that, Tre.

195
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.130
Our mole with the Russians
tells things
a little different.

196
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.490
According to him,
you sold him my coke
and you took the money.

197
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.820
That's a fucking lie!

198
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.730
I can't believe
that you would believe

199
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.960
this shit from
a fucking Russian, man!

200
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.360
Let me see, Tre.
Hey, what's more
likely, huh?

201
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.480
That you're
a greedy little
cocksucker

202
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.650
or all my coke was
stolen by Superman?

203
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.190
Batman.

204
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.190
I never said Batman!

205
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.540
Enough!

206
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.340
Now my son is
waiting out there

207
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.050
in the car to
go to the movies,

208
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.960
and I ain't gonna
disappoint him.

209
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.280
Joe, you're in charge.

210
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.490

wait, buddy.

216

The movie is
starting in 10 minutes.

217
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.950
It's okay. We're cool.
We're only gonna
miss the trailers.

218
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.920
Yeah. But I want to
get some popcorn.

219
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.890
When we get in there,
get Chris some popcorn.

220
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.190
Okay?

221
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.190
TRE: You fucking
motherfuckers!

222
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.730
What do you want to drink?
You want a Pepsi?

223
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.030
Yeah, that's fine.

224
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.030
Get him a Pepsi,
and I'll have an Icee.

225
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.930
Mixed.

226
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.700

the red one
and the blue one.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.120
or a power ring to
make a superhero.

232

Come on, Mindy, honey.

Be a big girl now.
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

Is it gonna hurt bad?

700 miles an hour.

245
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.710
So at close range
like this,

246
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.360
the force is
gonna take you off
your feet for sure,

247
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.650
but it's really
no more painful than
a punch in the chest.

248
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.070
I hate getting
punched in the chest.

Kind of fun, huh?
Now you know how it feels.

been scared anyways.

go by the bowling alley
on the way back.

what you might want
for your birthday?

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.320
JOE: Chris.

348
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.960
Good morning, Joe.

349
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.780
Frank, we got a thing.

350
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.350
It's a big thing, Frank.

351
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.500
Okay.

352
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.100
Sorry, hon.

353
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.550
Do what you got to do.

354
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.880
Chris, where do you
think you're going?

355
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.400
I got to talk to Dad.

356
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.400

FRANK: Where do you
think you're going?

359
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.540
I don't...
I don't mind you
talking business, Dad.

360
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.420
I was just gonna
sit in there quietly.

361
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.760
I mean, I should probably
start learning this
stuff anyway, right?

362
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.180
Hey, go finish
your oatmeal.

363
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.210

be 18 in eight months,
for Christ's sakes.

364

365

Take a seat.

366
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.870
So what's the problem?

367
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.990
Our Russian says
that Tre just sold him

368
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.640
another five keys
at half price.

369
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.630
Which Tre?
Tre Tre?

370
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.000
Right. Dead Tre.

371
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.050
So now I'm getting
fucked in the ass
by a ghost?

372
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.120
Or Tre was
telling the truth.

373
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:50.560
What, this is my choice,
I gotta believe in
ghosts or superheroes?

374
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.490
Well, not the part about
the superhero, Frankie,

375
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.030
but just that
he might have really been
gaffled by somebody.

376
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.570
I think we'd better
invite our Russian over
for a friendly chat,

377
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.690
see what's
really going on.

It's Filipino.

Excellent, good.

The AR-15 was a lighter,
smaller caliber version
of what design?

killing our guys.

out who that is,

Right?

528
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.980
And who knows,
buddy, this might
even get you laid.

529
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.350
No, not if she
thinks he's gay, Todd.
You fucking retard.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.210
Thanks, Marty,
this is really
fucking helping me.

No, I'm not!

It is what it is.

540
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.900
How about that, huh?

541
00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.460
Oh, yeah.
Didn't see that,
did you?

542
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.440
I think it's best
that you just walk away.

543
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.150
Well, maybe you
shouldn't do that.

Excuse me, ma'am.
Have you seen this cat?

552
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.690
I'm sorry.
Did you see
this cat?

the latest corruption scandal.
And coming up after the hour,

a costumed vigilante
has become the latest
Internet phenomenon

602
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.060
after a Hamilton Park resident
filmed the man's
remarkable intervention

603

in a gang-related
attack last week.

How far would you go
to help your fellow man?

608
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.950
This colorful individual
has been all over
the news this week

609
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.950
after a video of
his intervention
of street-gang violence

610
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.990

on the Internet.

and I was loving it.

614

NEWSCASTER: And finally,
we want to know
who is this man?

615
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.450
Does anyone have
any idea who this
wetsuit crusader is?

616
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.920

someone's brother,

someone's
next-door neighbor.

This guy happened.

for America, everybody.

623
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.900
Yeah, everybody's
favorite superhero
right now, Kick-Ass, right?

624
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:30.030
Kick-Ass! Yeah!

625
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.390
I like Kick-Ass!
His costume is crappy.

626
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.060
He looks like
a transvestite...

627
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.260
You know what?
Everyone likes Kick-Ass.

628
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.660
Did you see the clip?
He was actually pretty good.

629
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.330
Good at getting
his ass kicked.

630
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.900
He should call
himself Ass-Kick
instead. (LAUGHS)

631
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.100
That doesn't even
make sense.

632
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.210
CRAIG: ...transvestite
that is Kick-Ass
will take you down, I say!

633
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.140
That guy's gonna
end up dead,
that's what I think.

634
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.510
Are you serious?
The guy owns.

635
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.310
I'd e-mail his site
if I had a problem
worth fixing.

636
00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.550
What? Are you kidding me?
I got 100 guys
who can fix a problem,

637
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.020
you'd hire some
putz in pantyhose?

638
00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.150
Well, I wouldn't
wanna get in the way

639
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.390
of your business,
where I'm not wanted.

640
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.960
CRAIG: Please, I know
you have mistaken me
for Kick-Ass,

641
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.990
but I am not Kick-Ass.

642
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.530
You don't actually
read comics?

643
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.630
Yeah, I just started.

644
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.230
I got recommended some.

645
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.370
Like Scott Pilgrim
and Shojo Beat,
that kind of thing.

646
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.070
I'm not really
into the whole
superhero thing, though.

647
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.240
So I guess you're
not gonna line up

648
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.710
for that new
Kick-Ass comic then?

649
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.510
I guess not.

650
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.200
But you know what?
I was seriously thinking
of mailing his site.

651
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.400
I mean, I could really
use some help

652
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:52.980
from a guy like
that right now.

653
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.420
Help? Really?
What with?

654
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.350
You know I volunteer
at the needle exchange.

655
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.170
No, I didn't.

656
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.280
Well, there's this
one guy Rasul,
and I felt so sorry for him.

657
00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:08.420
And the more I found out
about his upbringing
and stuff, I just...

658
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.320
Wow, that's weird.
I'm usually the one
playing therapist.

659
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.730
Can I make
a confession?

660
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.560
Ever since I was little,
I've always wanted a friend

661
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.570
like you.

662
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.380
Is it okay
to say that?

663
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.380
Yeah.

664
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.200
I mean, that's not
homophobic, is it?

665
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.760
I mean, I don't think
you're all the same
or anything.

667
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:45.420
Of course not, no.

668
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:48.340
Thank you.

669
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.380
DAVE: I don't know if
I was everything

670
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.500
Katie had always dreamed
her gay BFF would be,

671
00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.360
but I tried my best.

672
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:02.990
But more importantly,
I talked her into
mailing Kick-Ass.

673
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.070
Long story short,
this particular
lame duck of hers

674
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.330
turned out to be
more of a lame cobra.

675
00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.880
She didn't want
the money back
that she'd given him

676
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.080
or an apology
for the black eye
he'd given her.

677
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.280
She just wanted him
to get that
they were through

678
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.850
and leave her alone.

679
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.610
And let's be real,
no other request

680
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.770
could have given me
more pleasure.

681
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.670
(LAUGHS)

682
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.730
Who the fuck are
you supposed to be,
the Green Condom?

683
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.760
You know it ain't
Halloween for another
few months, kid?

684
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.000
I'm here to see Rasul.

685
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.100
Who the fuck
are you?

686
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.620
I'm... I'm a
friend of Katie's.

687
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.780
Kids nowadays
in their tights.

688
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.270
So, which one of
you guys is Rasul?

689
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:33.180
I'm Rasul. Can't you
tell by my big titties?

690
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.070
What is this?
Trick or treat
or something?

691
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.620
Fuck! Now I'm dead.

692
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:47.160
I have a message
for Rasul about
Katie Deauxma.

693

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.240
I miss her.

866
00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.230
I miss you both.

867
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.950
I appreciate your concern.
But you need to go now.

868
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.990
I should warn you,
that asshole Gigante
is looking for Kick-Ass.

869
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.780
He got something to
do with you, Damon?

870
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.430
You started some kind of
fucked-up superhero club?

871
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.730
Never heard of him.

872
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.070
Okay, well,
heads up, all right?

873
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.750
You keep carrying on
like you've been carrying on,

874
00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.020
it's only a matter of time
before Gigante is
looking for you.

875
00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.590
He's been on Frank
D'Amico's payroll

876
00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:01.690
ever since you
passed up
the opportunity.

877
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.000
You know
I'm not gonna stop.

878
00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:10.200
Not until D'Amico
and his whole
damn operation

879
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:13.470
are burnt to ashes
and buried.

880
00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.140
It ain't gonna
bring her back, Damon.

881
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.760
This is not
the life for Mindy.

882
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.840
You owe that kid
a childhood.

883
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.670
I'll tell you who
owes her a childhood!

884
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:31.260
Frank D'Amico!

885
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:52.080
Holy shit.

886
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.820
I don't fucking
believe it.

887
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.820
Follow him,
around the corner.

888
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.260
Not too fast.

889
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.860
What's with
the high-fives?

890
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.220
I'll give you
a motherfucking high-five.

891
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.100
High-fiving bullshit.
Keep going, keep going.

892
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.700
Not too close.

893
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:25.560
He's going in the alley.

894
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.860
He's going in the alley.

895
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:31.800
Okay, when I tell you,
stop the car. Ready?

896
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:37.610
Hey, Kick-Ass.

897
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.910
How you doing?

898
00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.510
Kill my men, huh?

899
00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.410
Take my
fucking coke?

900
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.280
Whoa! Whoa! Boss,
what are you doing?

901
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:49.480
Boss, we gotta go, man.
Come on, let's go.

902
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:49.480
Fucking scumbag!

903
00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:51.790
Frank, Frank, Frank,
come on, he's
had enough. Come on.

904
00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.370
He's had enough.
Come on.

905
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.060
FRANK: What the fuck
are you looking at? Huh?

906
00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:00.100
Frank.

907
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.020
Come on, come on,
come on, come on,
let's go. We gotta go.

908
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:15.630
Shit. Come on,
come on, get in.

909
00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.940
KATIE: (CRYING) He was
so young. No one should
have to die that way.

910
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:29.220
I mean, I just
can't believe he's dead,
that's all.

911
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.630
DAVE: Oh, I know.
But, Katie,

912
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:38.720
guys like Rasul,
they get mixed up
in stuff...

913
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:42.100
No, I know, I know.
But what if it
was my fault?

914
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:43.670
What if Kick-Ass did it?

915
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.240
I mean, I feel like
I should call
the cops or something.

916
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.780
What? You're talking crazy.

917
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.730
There's no way.
He probably didn't even
read your e-mail yet.

918
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.810
Yeah.

919
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.810
You've got
nothing to worry about.

920
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.370
I'm so glad
you're here.

921
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:58.240
I was such a mess.

922
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.190
That's okay.

923
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.210
No problem.

924
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.840
You're the best.

925
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:10.270
I hope it's okay to
say this, but... It so
sucks that you're gay.

926
00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.170
FRANK: I don't fucking
believe this.

927
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.410
What kind of children's
enter-fucking-tainer
is that?

928
00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.780
Huh?

929
00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:27.000
What kind of kid has a...
A Spider-Man party,

930
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.850
sure, but a fucking
Kick-Ass party?

931
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.190
What, are they
selling paper plates

932
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:31.720
and napkins down
at the store now?

933
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.590
Frank, you're scaring me.
You're losing it.

934
00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.740
Since when did
you start getting

935
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:37.640
your hands dirty again?
And in public!

936
00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.010
Since when I ask
you fucks to
deliver me Kick-Ass,

937
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.410
and you don't deliver,
that's when.

938
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.430
Hey, give me a break.
It's been a week.

939
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.900
We e-mailed him.
We got half the crew out
doing petty crimes as bait.

940
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:48.670
We're busting
our asses here.

941
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.860
What the hell
are you doing?

942
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.860
You're back on
the powder now,
as well?

943
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:58.000
"Mommy, I want
a Kick-Ass party."
Dumb little fucks.

944
00:55:58.070 --> 00:55:59.150
(FRANK SNORTING COCAINE)

945
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.630
I know a way
you can get him.

946
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.630
Oh, shit

947
00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.330
Chris, how long
you been there?

948
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.800
What the hell
are you doing?
Get the hell out.

949
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.320
(STAMMERING)
Do you want to
hear it or not?

950
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.040
Hear what?

951
00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.590
Okay, look,

952
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.630
you're a superhero
and you're lonely,
but you can't trust anyone

953
00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.260
cause either
they'll expose your
secret identity...

954
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.560
Comic books this kid reads
all fucking day long.

955
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.270
The point is
there's only one way

956
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.550
a superhero can
trust a stranger.

957
00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.960
And I can be that stranger.
You just gotta
give me a chance.

958
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.360
I know I can do it.
I just need a few things.

959
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.380
Like what?

960
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.380
I need these things.

961
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:39.040
What, are you
fucking kidding me?
What the hell is this?

962
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.060
It's everything
I need.

963
00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.430
And you might have
to screw someone over,
like Louie, or something.

964
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.690
Louie? (EXCLAIMS)
Hey, Chris.

965
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.250
Or somebody.
It doesn't have
to be Louie.

966
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:48.930
Tony.

967
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:48.930
Tony!

968
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.050
Tony?

969
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.050
I hate Tony.

970
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.930
Yeah, fuck Tony.
He's a scumbag.

971
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.390
I swear, Dad,
if you let me do this,
it's gonna work.

972
00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.040
Tony.

973
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.900
Tony Romita, one of
America's most-wanted
crime kingpins,

974
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:07.870
was arrested
in Queens today

975
00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.720
after a 911 call
from someone claiming
to be a superhero...

976
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:13.290
TODD: So, how are things
going with Katie?

977
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.390
Oh, just peachy.

978
00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.080
We had a sleepover
and spent the whole night

979
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:21.760
watching the entire
Ugly Betty box set
and did pedicures.

980
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:25.280
I'm telling you,
the longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

981
00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.800
I know. I was gonna
tell her. It's just,
she seems so happy.

982
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:30.290
I don't know
when's the right time.

983
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.440
Now's your chance.

984
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:33.610
She didn't see that,
did she?

985
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.780
Hey, guys.

986
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:38.110
Hi!

987
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:38.110
Hi, sweetie.

988
00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.600
Oh, did you watch the TV?
The new superhero guy?

989
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:42.770
How cool is that?

990
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:42.770
What?

991
00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.670
Hey, look.

992
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.290
Oh? Could you
turn it up, please?

993
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.710
...dressed as Kick-Ass.

994
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.710
KATIE: Check this out.

995
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.610
But it seems that
far from being put off,

996
00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.680
this individual,
who calls himself
Red Mist,

997
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:53.910
has decided to
take crime-fighting
to a new level,

998
00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.220
as his actions last night
proved. Red Mist,
how do you see it?

999
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:59.820
Well, I guess folks have
just had enough of
living in fear, you know,

1000
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.420
and Kick-Ass
really proved that

1001
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.870
one individual can
make a difference.

1002
00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.810
So if anyone out there
needs help, I'll be
fighting crime 25/8.

1003
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.830
And I'm just
one click away.
Redmist.org.

1004
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:15.000
Can we turn that
off now? What's so
special about that guy?

1005
00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:18.100
He caught, like,
a drug dealer,
some most-wanted guy.

1006
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:19.870
You saw him
bringing out like
a ton of stuff.

1007
00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:21.770
That's pretty cool.

1008
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.190
He's got a way
better costume
than Kick-Ass, too.

1009
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.730
He's got a cape.

1010
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.730
Yeah.

1011
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.930
Capes rock.

1012
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.060
Yeah, I'm kind of
feeling the cape.

1013
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.470
He looks good.

1014
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.140
What, better
than Kick-Ass?

1015
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.400
I mean, they're
both kind of hot.

1016
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.670
I just think Red Mist
has a better body.

1017
00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.210
Don't you think, Dave?

1018
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.620
Uh...

1019
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:41.910
Yeah, Dave,
what do you think?

1020
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.910
Is he the kind of guy
you'd go for,
with all that leather?

1021
00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:50.420
No, Marty.
No, he's not
really my type.

1022
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.920
(THIS TOWN AIN'T BIG ENOUGH
FOR THE BOTH OF US PLAYING)

1023
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.590
(CLATTERING)

1024
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:44.560
Kick-Ass!

1025
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:46.860
Red Mist.

1026
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:50.610
Oh, shit! Fuck me,
that kind of hurt.

1027
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.400
Are you okay?

1028
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.400
Yeah, no, I'm cool.

1029
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:58.120
I can't believe
you're here, man.
Like, you're my hero.

1030
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:01.140
You inspired me.
No Kick-Ass, no Red Mist.

1031
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.460
Seriously.

1032
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.460

And I'm an idiot
and a shit friend.

1204
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.630
I lied to you, I know.

1205
01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:37.990
Oh, my God.

1206
01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.840
I know. If it makes
you feel any better,

1207
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:43.840
I don't think you can
hate me any more right now
than I hate myself.

1208
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:46.510
Please, I'm...

really sorry.

1210
01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:53.750
I've never met anyone
who's as beautiful

1211
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.740
and as kind and
lovely as you.

1212
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.010
You deserve better.

Yes?

1215
01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.780
My mom has
the burglar alarm
on downstairs,

1216
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:29.390
so you should probably
use the window.

1217
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.080
Or...

1218
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.500
Or you could just stay.

1219
01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.920
Stay?

1220
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:47.720
What, like when
we have a sleepover?

1221
01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.250
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to
scare you.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.450

get over it,

1224
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.950
on top of it,
and then into it,
right in the middle of it.

I found one.

they can deliver it
in three days.

of anything else
you'd rather spend it on?

1230
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.100

TODD: Out of Kick-Ass and
Red Mist, who do you think
would win in a fight?

1235
01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.670
Why are they fighting?
That seems stupid.

1236
01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.000
What do
you think?

1237
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:10.670
I don't know,
but I think
Kick-Ass is cuter.

out if I got the chance.

checking out that
new Kate Hudson movie

1244

where she's like
a shoe designer,
can't get a guy?

make the next showing.

you to a comics
reader right now.

DAVE: Suddenly, I understood
why superheroes only
existed in comic books.

1251
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.180
I got why people
didn't risk their lives
for strangers.

1252
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.410
Because for
the first time in my life,

1253
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.860
I had something
worth living for,

1254

1255
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:58.800
Katie worried
about me getting hurt,

1256
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:01.570
so I promised her
my Kick-Ass days were over.

1257
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.980
And the truth was
I hardly missed it at all.

I hadn't even checked
the website for,
like, a week.

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.650
Are you controlling
this right now?

1374
01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.650
I sure am.

1375
01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.770
Big Brother,
watch and learn.

1376
01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.240
Welcome back.
Breaking News.

1377
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:36.010
A worldwide web broadcast
of the New York superhero

1378
01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.410
who calls himself Kick-Ass
is about to be shown live.

1379
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.670
Rumors have it that
this will be Kick-Ass's
farewell appearance,

1380
01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.390
that he will announce
his retirement
from crime fighting.

1381
01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.400
But as word of mouth
continues to spread,

1382
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:49.270
Internet providers
are predicting that

1383
01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:53.090
it could be one of
the most widely-viewed
live events in web history.

1384
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.690
Wait, where's Dave?

1385
01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.330
There are no clues as yet
as to the exact nature...

1386
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.900
Holy shit.
Have you guys
noticed...

1387
01:22:57.970 --> 01:22:59.270
He's with Katie.

1388
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.530
Obviously.

1389
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.500
...come to
a standstill to watch.

1390
01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:03.470
Why else
would I be here?

1391
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:06.670
There's no idea
as to who is behind
the broadcast of this show,

1392
01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:10.030
but we could see
widespread server crashes...

1393
01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.150
Dave, why didn't
you tell me this is
what you were doing?

1394
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.100
You're on the news.
Call me.

1395
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.530
We go now over live
to the countdown clock
as we are moments away.

1396
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:31.630
Show time.

1397
01:23:33.570 --> 01:23:35.840
Hello, boys and girls.

1398
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.440
Now, this...

1399
01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.070
Well, you know
who this guy is.

1400
01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.490
And this guy
here is Big Daddy.

1401
01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.000
And these
are my friends.

1402
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:47.980
Come on in, guys,
say hello.

1403
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:51.590
Yeah, yeah,
there they are.
Hello, hello.

1404
01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:55.050
Now Big Daddy
and Kick-Ass are
gonna help us

1405
01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.130
show you why being
a hero is a bad idea.

1406
01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.200
You know what
a silent "K" is?

1407
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:04.000
That's when "K"
is at the beginning
of the word,

1408
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:06.920
but you don't pronounce it.
Like in the word
"Knuckleduster."

1409
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:10.400
Show them what
a knuckleduster
can do, guy.

(GASPS)

1411
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:11.760
JOE: That must have hurt!

1412
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:12.970
Let's see that again
from the other side.

1413
01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.140
Go on. Yeah,
I think it did.

1414
01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:20.000
Now in France,
they say the word "stick"
like this, bâton.

1415
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:21.550
We got some of
Kick-Ass's bâtons.

1416
01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:24.100
We're gonna show
you what they can do.
Go ahead, boys.

(ALL GASPING)

1419
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.720
In America,
we say "stick" like this.
Baseball bat.

1420
01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:32.790
(LAUGHING)

1421
01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:36.230
Which is very good
for hitting
knees and stomachs.

1422
01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.850
It's also good
for hitting balls.

1423
01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.170
Know what else we do?
We don't do them
individually.

1424
01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.970
We do them all together.
Gentlemen, please.

1425
01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.110
Yeah. Oh, this
looks very painful.

1426
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:52.680
(PAUSING VIDEO)

1427
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:54.900
NEWSCASTER: Due to
the distressing nature
of the images,

1428
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:56.750
we are unable to
broadcast the events

1429
01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.650
currently streaming
live on the Internet.

1430
01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.200
Fuck.

1431
01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.200
No. No, no, no.

1432
01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.510
NEWSCASTER: Despite
initial speculation
that this may be

1433
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:07.340
some kind of hoax
or publicity stunt,

1434
01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:10.680
it is now clear
that the hostages
are in genuine danger,

1435
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:12.930
that all signs point to
the intention to stage

1436
01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.270
a live execution in
the next few minutes.

1437
01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.990
DAVE: Even with my
metal plates and my
fucked-up nerve endings,

1438
01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:35.610
I got to tell you,
that hurt.

1439
01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.640
JOE: The kerosene.

1440
01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:41.930
Yes, the silent killer.

1441
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.270
DAVE: But not half as much
as the idea of leaving
everything behind.

1442
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.280
Katie,

1443
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.540
my dad,

1444
01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.750
Todd and Marty.

1445
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:55.680
And all the things
I'd never do,
like learn to drive,

1446
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:58.280
or see what
me and Katie's kids
would look like

1447
01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:00.280
or find out
what happened on Lost.

1448
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:01.500
Spicy, spicy.

1449
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.580
And if you're
reassuring yourself

1450
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:06.320
that I'm gonna make it
through this since
I'm talking to you now,

1451
01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.520

1452

you cavemen out there,

is fire.

Yeah! I think I'm in
love with her, dude.

she's about 11
years old, but...

I can wait!
I solemnly vow to
save myself for her.

Yeah.

Uh-huh.

1498
01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:03.170
But getting shot, Daddy,
it hurt a lot more
than when you did it.

1499
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:08.800
That's 'cause I used
low velocity rounds, child.

about the money.

would have wanted?

wanted me to finish
what we started.

what I'm gonna do.

Are you crazy?

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.480
My mom already
died for nothing.

1537
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:09.800
So I'm sure as hell
not gonna let my dad
die for nothing, too.

1538
01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:13.630
You can't do this
on your own.

1539
01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:17.340
Exactly.

1540
01:35:20.130 --> 01:35:21.790
Do you wanna deal
with owing my dad?

1541
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:26.130
Then shut the hell up
and pick your weapon.

Is that
what I think it is?
