00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:36,152
Hello, Mr. Shantanu.
-Arjun Singh, sir.

2
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:37,487
Please have a seat, sir.

3
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,734
l thought l'd see you
tomorrow morning.

4
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,503
Then my PA told me about
your tight schedule.

5
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,842
Thank you, Ajay. -Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,870
l shall come straight to
the point, Mr. Damani.

7
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,648
Two days ago we received..

8
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,707
..your draft for two crores
and this contract.

9
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:02,179
We've studied it,
and we can work on it.

10
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,717
Well, then l guess it's a deal.

11
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,548
Sir, there's a small problem.

12
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,118
You've given us 5%
service charge..

13
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,857
..and we were expecting 7%.

14
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:14,428
Before we discuss that
l'd like to see..

15
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,527
..the security arrangements and
facilities of your firm.

16
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:21,296
Sure. -But for that, we'll have
to go to the third floor.

17
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,769
And we can discuss on the way.

18
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:24,672
Yeah sure. -Please, follow me.

19
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,908
Mr. Shantanu, we've 32 diamond
mines in South Africa.

20
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,278
Come.

21
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,852
We send almost 50% of
the rough diamonds..

22
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,514
..from our mine to Jaipur,
for cutting and polishing.

23
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,587
But they're not very professional.

24
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,126
That's the reason why we want
to try out your firm.

25
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:44,823
Excuse me, we're here.

26
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:46,631
Sir. -Come.

27
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,832
This week, we'll be sending you..

28
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:52,997
..500 karat diamonds
from South Africa.

29
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:57,034
lf we get quality as well
as on-time delivery..

30
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,743
..we'll increase our quota.

31
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:01,245
That's great.
-So, before taking any decision..

32
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,646
..please look at the bigger
picture, Mr. Shantanu. -Sure.

33
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,919
Sir.
-This is our state-of-the-art..

34
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,358
..cutting and polishing section.

35
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,259
The workers' shift ends
at 6 other'clock.

36
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,854
That's why the room is
empty at the moment.

37
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,331
Excuse me, Mr. Singh.
-Yes, please.

38
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,565
ln this unit the polished
diamonds are matched..

39
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:29,903
..sorted and checked.

40
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,534
Excuse me for a minute. -Sure.

41
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,005
Yes, Mr. Jethmalani.

42
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,446
Yes, l've reached Mumbai.

43
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:39,911
No, sorry, l won't be able
to come to your office.

44
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,078
lt's already seven.

45
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,090
Yes,
l suggest l'll send my secretary..

46
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:48,093
..Mr. Arjun Singh to your office.
He'll collect the papers.

47
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:49,817
Yes, of course.

48
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,561
We'll meet at the
minister's party.

49
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:52,829
Okay.

50
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,059
Arjun Singh. -Yes.

51
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,634
Go to Mr. Jethmalani's office
and collect the papers.

52
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:57,829
Ok. -And come to the hotel.

53
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,364
You won't have any
problem going out.

54
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,063
The doors are open by them self.
-Fine.

55
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,840
There's a fixed paneling
of 12-inches..

56
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,470
..on every wall of this floor.

57
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,072
This is the most secure
place in this building.

58
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,318
lt's impossible to get in here.

59
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:16,488
The diamonds are sorted in
this windowed section.

60
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:20,158
And as you know,
natural light is very necessary.

61
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,888
Hi. Punch in your code. -Okay.

62
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,710
The grills outside these windows..

63
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,146
..are made of 3-inches
thick stainless steel.

64
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,380
Mike brother, where are you?

65
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,077
Hello.

66
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,515
Just to let you know, l'm in.

67
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,053
lt's time to win.

68
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,556
At 8 other'clock in the night
when we shut down..

69
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:01,224
..440 volts of current
run through them.

70
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,299
Coming in contact with them will
be hundred percent fatal.

71
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,711
This grill can't be
blast open either.

72
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,104
l'm impressed.

73
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,212
This is a pretty good setup.

74
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,145
Shall we leave? -Please, come.

75
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,256
And by the way,
the entire building is monitored..

76
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,302
..24-hours by close-circuit
cameras.

77
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:37,859
This place is like a fortress.

78
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:49,772
l'm happy we're in safe hands.

79
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,079
lt'll be a pleasure doing
business with you.

80
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,241
Thank you, Mr. Damani.

81
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,850
l assure you, there has never
been a theft here..

82
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,317
..and there will never be one.

83
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,785
You won't have any complaints
from us.

84
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:19,061
Mike, all set? -Yes.

85
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,397
Good.

86
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,798
So, we're ready to play.
-Yes, we're in position.

87
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,734
lt's show time.

88
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:26,903
We're on.

89
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,386
Let's go up. Something's wrong.

90
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,960
Prince. -Mike, what's up?

91
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,661
Prince, the guards are coming up.
What should we do?

92
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,330
Should we abort? -No way.

93
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,603
Mike, plan B.

94
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,577
lt's plan B.

95
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,366
$Oh no. Call for back up. -Yes.

96
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:39,296
Alert! Alert! Alert!

97
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:41,129
$Come on, come on. Let's go.

98
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,338
$That way. Hurry up.

99
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:56,246
$Come on, quickly.

100
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,542
$Sir, target has stopped.

101
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,778
Put your hands up in the air!

102
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:32,424
Don't move, don't move!

103
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,420
l said, don't move!

104
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:39,925
Or we'll fire!

105
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:41,558
$Watch out.

106
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:45,969
lt's show time.

107
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:47,862
$Oh no, he has jumped.

108
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,473
$Target has jumped off the roof.

109
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,804
$l repeat,
target has jumped off the roof.

110
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:48,759
$Darn.

111
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:54,431
$As you can see,
we're standing right outside..

112
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,100
The office of Diamond Corporation
of lndia..

113
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,507
..where the biggest theft
of the millennium..

114
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:00,978
..has been committed. -We've
learnt from reliable sources..

115
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,672
..that this theft has been
committed last night.

116
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,682
This is the biggest heist
ever reported.

117
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,012
Yes,
the biggest heist ever report..

118
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,245
Yes,
let's watch what happens next.

119
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,049
The CBl is reaching
in a short while.

120
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:14,782
Excuse me, sir. Sir.

121
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,391
Sir. -Sir, one question please.

122
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,394
Sir, this is the job
of the local police.

123
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,691
Sir, one question please.
-No comments.

124
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,527
Sir, the thief was successful
in pulling off the heist..

125
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,798
..inspite of such foolproof
arrangements.

126
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,304
-Thought DCOl kept the..

127
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,272
Why are you glorifying him?

128
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,404
He's just a thief and not God.

129
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,967
Sir, don't you wonder
how he could commit..

130
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,775
..the robbery inspite of
such tight security?

131
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,839
Security is only for
the white-collared.

132
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,540
So, sir, what's for the thieves?
-Please.

133
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,050
Prison. Only prison.
-Sir, one more question please.

134
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,060
This thief was very smart. -Okay.

135
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,752
All the recorded evidence we'd..

136
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,764
..in our video cameras,
he's erased everything.

137
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,629
Completely wiped them out, clean.
-Okay.

138
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,233
Did you find anything? -No.

139
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,759
Good morning, sir.

140
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:01,505
You're a very positive man.

141
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,002
l see you at every crime scene..

142
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,775
..and you wish me 'Good morning,
sir'.

143
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,407
lf anyone dies,
'Good morning, sir'.

144
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,606
lf there's a bomb blast,
even then 'Good morning, sir'.

145
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,110
Sir, you're my senior.

146
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,881
And.. it's my duty to wish
you good morning.

147
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:19,181
Your duty is to catch
the criminal.

148
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,426
Any clues? -No, sir.

149
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,124
We only got the staffs
fingerprints.

150
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,422
And no one else's.

151
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:27,798
Mark this. -Yes.

152
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,958
He's a very cunning thief.

153
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:32,369
Notjust one or two, but he has
stolen kilos of diamonds.

154
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:34,703
And from this little hole.

155
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,675
Sir, l don't understand
how this is possible.

156
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,669
Wherever he goes anything
is possible.

157
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,313
Who's that, sir?

158
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:46,943
Prince.

159
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,833
Come to me, darling.

160
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,836
ln your arms..

161
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,310
Come to me, darling.

ln your arms..

163
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:22,447
Rock this party tonight.

164
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,563
God.

165
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,267
Rock this party tonight.

166
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:47,073
Oh my Lord.

167
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:49,078
l've lost my heart.

168
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:52,582
l've lost contact with
both the worlds.

169
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,649
Oh my Lord.

170
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,754
l've lost my heart.

171
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:00,416
l don't know when this happened.

172
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,387
Oh my Lord.

173
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:23,439
l'll inhibit your dreams.

174
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,946
l'll dwell in your eyes.

175
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:31,014
My image will dwell
in your memory.

176
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:34,985
No one will ever find me.

177
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,819
Oh my Lord.

178
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:38,690
l've lost my heart.

179
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:42,595
l've lost contact with
both the worlds.

180
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,665
Oh my Lord.

181
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,498
l've lost my heart.

182
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:52,803
l don't know when this happened.

183
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,656
Come to me, my darling.

184
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,492
Don't torment me like this.

185
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,067
l'll surrender myself
in your arms.

186
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,031
Come to me, my darling.

187
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:21,105
Don't torment me like this.

188
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,199
l'll surrender myself
in your arms.

189
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,312
We'll meet during lonely nights.

190
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:32,346
We'll talk the night away.

191
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:36,080
Everything seems different.

192
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,054
Since my world has changed.

193
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,154
Oh my Lord.

194
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:44,088
l've lost my heart.

195
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,822
l've lost contact with
both the worlds.

196
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,959
Oh my Lord.

197
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,036
l've lost my heart.

198
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:56,434
l don't know when this happened.

199
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:08,272
Who are you? -PK.

200
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,314
Your servant, sir.

201
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,250
Your servant.

202
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:16,914
Who are you?

203
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:18,680
Your servant, sir.

204
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,289
Your servant.

205
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,332
Who..who am l?

206
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,027
Sir.

207
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:45,867
So you really don't remember
anything, sir?

208
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:51,776
Who.. What is my name?

209
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:54,278
Your name..your name is that, sir.
-What's that?

210
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,655
Prince. -Your name is Prince, sir.

211
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:57,620
Prince?

212
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:01,081
Prince!

213
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:06,787
This..this house?
-lt's your house, sir.

214
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,061
Sir,
you've another house in the city.

215
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,702
You often come here for weekends.

216
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,871
Three days ago you phoned me from
your house in the city..

217
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,964
..and called me there.

218
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,675
l'd just reached the
building compound..

219
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,768
..when your that arrived.
-What's that?

220
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,369
Your car, sir.

221
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,581
Your arm was bleeding.

222
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,273
l asked you how you got hurt.

223
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,510
But you scolded me, sir.

224
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:28,682
On the way l asked you again..

225
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:30,949
..whether we should go see a
doctor. --But you scolded again.

226
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,123
Sir, you kept yelling at me all
the way till we came here.

227
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,293
And..l hadn't lost my memory then?

228
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,287
No sir! You remembered everything.

229
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,593
You said to me, Get that
from the bedroom drawer.

230
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,598
First-aid box!

231
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:45,660
l got it. l even bandaged you.
-But you fell unconscious.

232
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,262
-And when you regained
consciousness..

233
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:48,465
..you started strangling me.

234
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,568
And before l could free myself
and say something..

235
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:53,702
..you fainted.

236
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,770
l couldn't tell you anything
about your condition..

237
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,282
..or the condition of your car.

238
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,275
The condition of my car?

239
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,477
lt's in a bad shape, sir.

240
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,318
Look..bullet holes.

241
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:04,582
Here..and another one here.

242
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:05,714
Two.

243
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:09,021
Sir, l feel someone followed
you and tried to kill you.

244
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:10,887
Sir, between you and me..

245
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,521
..there are only two types of
people who fire bullets.

246
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,496
First are goons,
and second are them.

247
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,692
The police.

248
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,434
So, no doctor, no police.
Right, sir?

249
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,796
'Sir,
you've another house in the city.'

250
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,371
'Your name..your name is that,
sir. -What's that?'

251
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,768
'Prince.'

252
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:29,343
'Sir, l think someone followed
you and tried to kill you.'

253
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,287
Sir,
can l get anything else for you.

254
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,516
Fine, sir.

255
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:47,025
PK..what..what do l do?
-You shift things around.

256
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,464
l mean, sir, you work at
an import-export firm.

257
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,292
Sir, l've your card as well.

258
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,132
l'll show it to you right now.

259
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:54,930
Here.

260
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,053
'We're right outside the Wolf
lnternational building.'

261
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,214
'l'm reporting live..'

262
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,723
'..from the headquarters
of Wolf lnternational.'

263
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,156
'As you can see behind me..'

264
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,222
'..a serious crime has obviously
been committed here.'

265
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:23,300
'But the police are refusing to
give out any information.'

266
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:28,068
You said that l've an apartment
in the city.

267
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,076
Yes, sir.
lt's close-by. -Which way?

268
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:34,174
Left from the high-way.

269
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:35,635
Let's go, sir.

270
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,316
Keep going, sir.
Our building is ahead.

271
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,050
Police. -Police?

272
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,288
No, sir. Everyone dressed
in blue isn't the police.

273
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,652
They're in orange jackets.

274
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:50,794
The municipality.

275
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,562
They must've come to
clear the garbage.

276
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,662
They aren't the police. -Yes.

277
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,135
They're much more dangerous
than the police.

278
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:09,071
Sir..sir, can l go home? -Go.

279
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:10,572
Thank you, sir.

280
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:12,540
Wait!

281
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:19,612
lf l don't come back home
within 24 hours..

282
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,153
..inform the police.

283
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,320
Okay, sir.

284
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,492
Who are you?

285
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,423
Prince.

286
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:34,765
These are your MRl scans.

287
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,438
They're all clear.

288
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,440
Your nervous system is
in perfect order.

289
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:49,582
There are no marks of internal
injury in your skull.

290
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:52,782
All your blood tests are
absolutely clear.

291
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:54,552
You also remember everything..

292
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,025
..that occurred for
the past two days.

293
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:57,359
Names of people..

294
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,896
..addresses, how to drive
a car, how to come here.

295
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:04,600
You can do all daily chores.

296
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:11,332
Then why did l..suddenly
suffer this memory loss?

297
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:15,643
The human brain is still a big
mystery to medical science.

298
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:18,306
Your case is strange, Mr. Prince.

299
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:21,047
But trust me, l'll try my best.

300
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,817
But it will take time.

301
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:24,787
You'll have to be patient.

302
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:11,591
Prince.

303
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,630
l heard that you're very fast.

304
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,202
Today l saw it for myself.

305
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:20,576
l'm impressed.

306
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:24,515
So am l.

307
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,579
l don't like wasting bullets.

308
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:32,684
So, it's better you don't
make any smart moves.

309
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:36,025
Who are you?

310
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:38,696
And what do you want?

311
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,627
You'll soon know what we want.

312
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,094
Now, come on.

313
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:48,026
Good work, Roy.

314
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:51,125
And welcome to l-Grip, Prince.

315
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,264
lndian Government Research and
lntelligence Portfolio.

316
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,638
You might've never heard
about this unit of ours.

317
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,848
You're talking to Colonel Khanna,
Bureau Chief.

318
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,781
Let me come straight to the point,
Prince.

319
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,581
Where is that coin? -Coin?

320
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:16,860
Which coin?
-The same antique gold coin..

321
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,953
..for which you struck
a deal with..

322
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,793
..Sarang for 500 million rupees.

323
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,025
Yes, we know.

324
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,670
There are many ways of extracting
information.

325
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,334
So it's better that you
tell us quickly.

326
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:32,105
Where is that coin?

327
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,040
l don't know about any gold coin.

328
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:40,579
So, you want to act tough?

329
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:45,889
Now get up, come on.

330
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,297
Start the brain-mapper.

331
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:19,416
Let's load his memory.

332
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,191
Take note of it.

333
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,173
This is unbelievable, Colonel.

334
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:48,047
He has only a day's memory.

335
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,217
Sir, how can it be possible.

336
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:51,784
Try once more.

337
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,181
Okay, try once again.

338
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,782
Sir, this isn't possible
in medical science.

339
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,349
But you know, Colonel, all the
other information is missing.

340
00:31:56,428 --> 00:31:58,521
And it seems like he has..
-Like, he has..

341
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:01,498
..used the coin..on himself.

342
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:02,924
Sir, it's not working sir.

343
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:04,499
l know that. But you keep trying.

344
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:07,497
There are many people who
are after this coin.

345
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:10,773
We came all the way from
lndia for this coin.

346
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:12,901
lt's very difficult
to hide this coin.

347
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:14,702
Sir, he has just a day's memory.

348
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,107
l know, even l can see that.

349
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,148
But, try once again.

350
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,045
Sir, we should keep a
strict watch on him.

351
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:21,819
Maybe,
he might remember something.

352
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:25,953
Gradually, when his life and
memory become normal..

353
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:28,389
Normal? He's Prince, Roy.

354
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:33,931
His life was never normal,
and it'll never be.

355
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:36,894
Take him.

356
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:48,072
You've lost your memory and
the reason is that coin.

357
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:51,741
So let me tell you a few
important things.

358
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:57,447
Sarang wanted to give you 500
million for that coin.

359
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,222
You need to remember
just one thing.

360
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:05,786
You'd that coin in your hands..

361
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:08,559
..and you'll soon have it again.

362
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,231
Because,
you aren't doing this job alone.

363
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:12,462
There's someone with you.

364
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:18,802
Your partner. -Partner?

365
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:24,604
When your partner contacts you,
you tell him that..

366
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:28,208
..that coin is worth much
more than you thought.

367
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,754
Sarang was offering you 500.

368
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,585
We'll give you 1000.

369
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:35,853
Do you understand?

370
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:38,952
That coin is like God for you.

371
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,759
And only that can save your life.

372
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,660
But you've only four days.

373
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,240
No one can save you
after four days.

374
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,605
Not even God.

375
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,010
Take him.

376
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,266
Candy Club, 9pm.

377
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:23,205
Maya.

378
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,589
Sir, that's Mr. Sarang.

379
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:41,590
Your boss.

380
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:51,396
Have you ever felt that l'm
not into import-export.

381
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:55,405
But something illegal?
-Never, sir. Not at all.

382
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:56,633
You're a very nice man.

383
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:59,239
Actually,
sir, once l was in need of money.

384
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,870
You gave me double
of what l needed.

385
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,712
Do you know of any
girl called Maya?

386
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,080
Not any girl,
sir, she's your girlfriend.

387
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,848
She works with you.

388
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:12,079
ln fact, you also said..

389
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:13,622
..that you're going to marry her.

390
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:18,486
Do you've Maya's number?

391
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:19,790
How can l've her number, sir?

392
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,330
lt must be saved in your mobile.

393
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,294
But it was lost that night.

394
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,327
Maya.

395
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:48,655
You dwell in my eyes.

396
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:52,693
You inhibit my breath.

397
00:35:56,935 --> 00:36:00,666
All day and all night.

398
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:04,099
The restless heart says.

399
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:08,040
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

400
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:12,010
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

401
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:15,946
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

402
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:40,309
Let me come closer to you.

403
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,207
There are burning desires.

404
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:51,955
lt's difficult to spend these
restless nights without you.

405
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,554
Let me come closer to you.

406
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:00,861
There are burning desires.

407
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:07,905
lt's difficult to spend these
restless nights without you.

408
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:12,201
Life and death are meaningless
without you.

409
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:16,345
My heart..for you baby, now.

410
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:20,448
My heart..for you baby, now.

411
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:24,452
My heart..for you baby, now.

412
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:28,624
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

413
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:46,911
Excuse me.

414
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:48,870
ls there a Maya..

415
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,534
Maya. -Prince.

416
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:14,863
l missed you so much.

417
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:22,038
l thought..
l thought l'd lost you forever.

418
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:27,446
Oh, God. l was.. l was so scared.

419
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:30,181
l was so scared.

420
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,083
How is your arm now?

421
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:38,519
Are you seeing your Maya
for the first time?

422
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,354
Prince, l'm.. -l am..

423
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,493
l'm sorry.

424
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:48,705
Honestly, l don't recognise you.

425
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:51,706
Maya.

426
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,010
You've lost your memory.

427
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,146
But not my love.

428
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:06,118
l'll remind you of our story.

429
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,056
Those beautiful moments
we spent together.

430
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,759
'But, someone jinxed your love.'

431
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:18,829
'Sarang.'

432
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:21,803
'The biggest white-collar
criminal of Durban.'

433
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:26,906
'But you were Sarang's
real power.'

434
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:28,701
'His number one man.'

435
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,514
'Only a few were fated
to play with Sarang.'

436
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:36,252
'But no one could
win against him.'

437
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:41,982
'We wanted to start a new life.'

438
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:45,819
'A life that belonged only to us.'

439
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:48,621
'And weren't moments
stolen from Sarang.'

440
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,865
'You knew everything
about Sarang.'

441
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,563
'And only death could
separate someone..'

442
00:39:55,973 --> 00:39:57,941
'..from Sarang who knew
so much about him.'

443
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:00,268
'But you were never
scared of death.'

444
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,681
Maya, l'm going to steal
Sarang's coin. -Coin?

445
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,517
Yes, Sarang's coin.

446
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:08,984
lt was no ordinary coin.

447
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:12,254
lt was made in Sri Lanka,
3000 years ago.

448
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:14,119
And it's said that the gold
it was created from..

449
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:15,887
..came from Ravan's chariot.

450
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:20,029
And it's also said that
it has magical powers.

451
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:22,290
You made a plan that after
stealing the coin..

452
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,994
..you'd come home and pick me up.

453
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,398
But that night,
when l was waiting for you..

454
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:31,602
Hello. -Maya.

455
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,671
Prince, where are you?

456
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,940
Maya, l've been shot. -What?

457
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,747
Relax, l'll be fine. Listen to me.

458
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,480
l've stolen Sarang's coin.

459
00:40:40,752 --> 00:40:42,151
But his men are following me.

460
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:44,950
Prince, are you fine?

461
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,348
l'm fine, Maya.

462
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:47,884
But you aren't safe there.

463
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:49,486
Get out of there immediately.

464
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:50,887
Go somewhere safe.

465
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:52,561
l'll contact you later, okay.
-But..

466
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:55,394
Maya, l love you.

467
00:40:58,102 --> 00:40:59,000
l love you too.

468
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,002
Prince.

469
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,768
l couldn't do anything
else but wait.

470
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,010
Forget about Sarang,
his coin and the money.

471
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,340
You know, Ruby knows a bar
owner in Cape Town.

472
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:15,411
l'll get a job there.

473
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:18,120
Please.

474
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:20,318
Please return Sarang his coin.

475
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,054
So he can leave us alone.

476
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:23,992
Right.

477
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:25,988
l don't have that coin.

478
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:31,597
You said you've hidden
that coin somewhere.

479
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:34,631
Only the coin can save us
from Sarang, Prince.

480
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:40,133
l.. l've forgotten everything.

481
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:43,011
And.. until l find that coin..

482
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:46,349
..you'll have to stay with Ruby.

483
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:50,082
There are many people after
me for that coin.

484
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:52,620
l'm not safe.

485
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:57,557
l'll contact you myself after
l find the coin, okay?

486
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:01,359
Okay, but..

487
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,466
But,
where will you look for the coin?

488
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:12,006
'Sarang wanted to give you 500
million for that coin.'

489
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,511
'There's someone with you.'

490
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:25,187
'That coin is like God for you.'

491
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:26,984
'And only that can
save your life.'

492
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,331
'But you've only four days.'

493
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,733
'No one can save you
after four days.'

494
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:37,893
'Not even God.'

495
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,077
Hello, Prince.
This is Maya speaking. -Maya?

496
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,507
Yes, Maya. -But l told you..

497
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,446
Look, meet me immediately
at the boat club.

498
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:53,483
Are you fine? -Yes.

499
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:55,410
l'm waiting for you
at pier number 4.

500
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,147
Come as soon as possible.
Okay. -Maya! Maya!

501
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:04,161
Pier number 4?

502
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:21,407
Prince. Prince.

503
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:25,106
Thank God you're okay.

504
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,376
l was so worried.

505
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,278
How is your arm now?

506
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:30,383
l've been trying to contact
you for the past two days.

507
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:32,319
But l couldn't get through
to your mobile.

508
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,017
And you didn't contact me either.

509
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,422
Finally l spoke to Sarang..

510
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,723
..and have taken 24 hours time.

511
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:40,530
Anyway, we'll need that much time.
-Who are you?

512
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:44,962
What's wrong with you, Prince?

513
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:49,737
l'm Maya.

514
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:57,672
Prince.. -You aren't Maya.

515
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:00,573
But you know that l've
lost my memory.

516
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,610
And you're trying to take
advantage of it.

517
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,678
Why? Who are you?

518
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:07,087
What are you saying, Prince?

519
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,322
What's wrong with your memory?

520
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:11,318
l'm Maya.

521
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,121
CBl officer Maya Malhotra.

522
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:15,895
You're Maya?

523
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:22,871
Prince.

524
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,139
Prince! What's wrong?

525
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:32,407
Prince!

526
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:54,135
Your gun.

527
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:00,711
Your lD.

528
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,042
CBl officer Prince.

529
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:06,881
CBl?

530
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,885
And this is your partner.
l mean, mine.

531
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:13,722
Officer Maya Malhotra.

532
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:17,158
We're working with the CBl chief,
officer Khan.

533
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,662
Now do you believe me?

534
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,827
These.. these id's could be fake!!

535
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,099
Fake?

536
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,464
Do you know what this is?

537
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:30,338
The map of Sarang's house.

538
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,939
And this is Sarang's case file..

539
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,770
..lt has all his details.

540
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:40,512
We came here to get
Sarang arrested.

541
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,544
Operation 'Durban Under Cover'.

542
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:45,912
Stage one,
winning Sarang's trust..

543
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,925
..and working with him.

544
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:52,423
Stage two,
collecting evidence against him..

545
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,930
..and arresting him red-handed.

546
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,531
But it wasn't so easy
to get to Sarang.

547
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:00,695
Because Sarang is South Africa's..

548
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:03,339
..biggest white-collar criminal.

549
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:06,341
And no one can lay a hand on him.

550
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,918
That's why we posed as
thieves ourselves.

551
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,616
And committed three high-profile
robberies.

552
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:26,090
Paris, Jakarta, and the Diamond
Corporation of lndia.

553
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:30,165
And after that Sarang noticed us.

554
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,431
He contacted us..

555
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:34,494
..and gave us a proposal
to join him.

556
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,767
Then he gave us the job..

557
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:42,938
..of stealing an antique coin
from the Cape Town Museum.

558
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,611
Our plan was that..

559
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:47,616
..after we steal the coin and
deliver it to Sarang..

560
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:51,313
..Officer Khan would arrest
him red-handed.

561
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:53,546
The Durban police was after us.

562
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:56,256
Because they didn't know
that we were undercover.

563
00:46:57,161 --> 00:47:00,096
We parted that day,
and met only today.

564
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,597
We still have a lot left to do,
Prince.

565
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,190
And l can't do it alone.
l need you.

566
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:06,494
One more thing.

567
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,507
We aren'tjust partners at CBl.

568
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,071
We're life-partners as well.

569
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,840
Here's the coffee.

570
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,441
Without sugar and milk for sir.

571
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:24,384
And for madam'am,
sugar and milk are separate.

572
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:25,689
Right.

573
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:30,288
You remember everything other
than names, isn't it?

574
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,294
What's in the name, Maya madam?

575
00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:34,288
Thankfully sir met you.

576
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:37,531
Otherwise, l was going on
answering his questions.

577
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:38,693
Mad. -PK!

578
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:40,034
Okay, sir.

579
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:44,074
That foolish servant
of mine says that..

580
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,741
..l work for Sarang's company,
Wolf lnternational.

581
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:49,804
An unknown girl says that..

582
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,674
..Sarang is a gangster and
l'm his right-hand man.

583
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:54,081
And now you.

584
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:56,517
You say that l'm an undercover
agent for CBl.

585
00:47:56,587 --> 00:47:58,350
And l was gathering evidence
against Sarang.. -Prince!

586
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:00,756
Sarang isn't an ordinary gangster.

587
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,683
He has offices all over the world.

588
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,322
He operates from Durban.

589
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:07,226
But he has connections with
international cartels.

590
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:10,694
l don't know about the lie
that girl has told you.

591
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:14,863
All l know is that your
life is in danger.

592
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:19,609
Because Sarang has contacts from
the ministry to the media.

593
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,504
Sarang can go to any limits
to wipe out his enemy.

594
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,381
Regardless of what price
he has to pay for it.

595
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:33,485
Sarang gets everything he wants.

596
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:36,422
And now his sights
are on that coin.

597
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:39,061
And it's very important for
us to find it, Prince.

598
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,857
You don't know how dangerous
Sarang is.

599
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:11,457
Any news? -No, sir, nothing yet.

600
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:13,520
Contact SERENA.

601
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:16,264
Find out where Prince
and his Maya are.

602
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:36,179
That girl who was dancing
here yesterday..

603
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:37,845
..hasn't she come?

604
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:40,850
There are many such girls
who come here everyday.

605
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:43,687
Do you know her address?

606
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:46,792
l don't know her address.

607
00:49:53,837 --> 00:49:54,826
Your drink.

608
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:55,997
This is my number.

609
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:00,201
And this is yours.

610
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:05,214
Call me if you find her address.

611
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:13,421
Hello.

612
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,684
Your lover was here.

613
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:18,889
He was asking for your address.
-What?

614
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:21,489
He has offered me 25,000.

615
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:25,124
Send 50 before the club
closes down. -Okay.

616
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:29,304
'Hello.
Welcome to News One. l'm Pragya.'

617
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,407
Rahul Singh, son of lnfrastructure
Minister Vinod Singh..

618
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:34,410
'..passed away in a
plane accident.'

619
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:36,070
'We've learnt from reliable
sources..'

620
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:39,272
'..that Rahul Singh was testing
his new private jet.' -Sir.

621
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:43,716
'Rahul Singh's close friend
and business associate..'

622
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:46,287
'..has expressed his condolences.'
-Mike. -Sorry, sir.

623
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:49,324
We've still not found out the
reason behind this accident.

624
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:56,928
For God's sake,
Priya, you know l'm with Sarang.

625
00:50:57,034 --> 00:50:58,001
Shut up, Mike.

626
00:50:58,102 --> 00:50:59,399
This is an emergency, okay.

627
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:01,303
We're in trouble.

628
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:04,800
Prince came back to Candy Club.
-Oh, my God.

629
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:07,406
Why.. why did he come there?

630
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:09,403
Tomorrow he'll come here
looking for me.

631
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,845
Priya, l'd told you before..
-Send 50,000 today to Tony..

632
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:14,679
..before the club closes, okay?

633
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:16,584
Forget the coin, Priya.

634
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:20,853
lt isn't easy to deceive
Sarang or Prince.

635
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:25,657
Mike. You know l'm doing
all this for us.

636
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:28,830
You know l love you.

637
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,168
Come here.

638
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:20,476
What are you thinking about?
-About the coin.

639
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:25,845
l've found my Prince.

640
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,475
So Prince will find
his coin as well.

641
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:33,885
l don't want to leave.

642
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,723
But l need to contact
the department.

643
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:43,893
They suspect you.

644
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:51,397
And l need to ask Sarang
for some more time.

645
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:56,736
But don't worry.

646
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:01,180
l know,
you'll surely find the coin.

647
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:03,884
Okay.

648
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:10,891
Khan.

649
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:16,596
l didn't know you'd be waiting
here to welcome me.

650
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:18,560
lt's such a happy occasion.

651
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:20,125
The CBl was involved
in the coin robbery.

652
00:54:20,203 --> 00:54:21,568
And you didn't tell us that.

653
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:23,534
Sir, l didn't know that l-GRlP..

654
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,107
..was interested in
the coin as well.

655
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:27,837
lt's clearly written in
1st August's circular..

656
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:29,936
..that l-GRlP is the
highest authority.

657
00:54:30,948 --> 00:54:32,108
Higher than CBl.

658
00:54:32,783 --> 00:54:34,683
l'm sorry, sir, but l didn't
read that circular.

659
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,150
What happened in the
coin robbery case?

660
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:40,657
Maya has located Prince.

661
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:44,284
And we're almost ready
to nab Sarang.

662
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:46,957
We don't have anything
to do with Sarang.

663
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,228
We just want the coin, Khan.

664
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:53,100
At any cost. -Fine, sir.

665
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:57,501
The coin will be yours.
But Sarang will be ours.

666
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:01,209
Okay.

667
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:07,281
You'll have to keep me informed
about whatever you do.

668
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:11,216
Why just you,
we should inform Sarang as well..

669
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:13,315
..about the plan we've
hatched to nab him.

670
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,452
Actually,
why don't we publish a newspaper?

671
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:18,152
Times of Crime.

672
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:20,253
Khan, don't act smart.

673
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:24,061
Roy, l'm smart.

674
00:55:36,246 --> 00:55:40,808
PK, try to remember.

675
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:43,609
l want to know.

676
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:47,047
The other night,
did we stop anywhere?

677
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,088
Anywhere? -No,
sir, l've told you so many times.

678
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,094
That night,
once we left from that house..

679
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:54,695
..we stopped only after we
got here, that's all.

680
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:03,967
Car.

681
00:59:26,943 --> 00:59:29,878
Hi, baby. -Maya, guess what.

682
00:59:31,147 --> 00:59:32,341
l found the coin.

683
00:59:33,016 --> 00:59:36,144
That's amazing, Prince.
-Yes, l know it's amazing.

684
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,311
Okay,
tell me what we need to do next.

685
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,087
Sarang is at his farm house at
the moment, Santa Cabana.

686
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:45,684
l'll contact him and arrange
for the coin's delivery.

687
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:48,627
Sarang will come with his men.

688
00:59:48,732 --> 00:59:53,066
And officer Khan will be ready
with his men to nab him.

689
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,301
There's a place amidst
the mountains..

690
00:59:55,572 --> 00:59:57,904
..where Sarang can't hide.

691
00:59:58,241 --> 01:00:00,573
lt's called Wild Extreme.

692
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:20,288
Everything is set.

693
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:23,031
Khan is reaching with his team.

694
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:31,933
Where did you find the coin?

695
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,468
ln the heel of my shoe.

696
01:00:39,382 --> 01:00:40,576
Sarang.

697
01:01:19,356 --> 01:01:21,517
Prince, my number one man.

698
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:24,859
l heard that you were shot.

699
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:27,689
l was worried.

700
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:32,095
Where's the coin?
-Where's our money?

701
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:48,309
Coin.

702
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:09,531
Sarang!

703
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:27,247
No!

704
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:57,912
Leave me!

705
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,764
There's something wrong, isn't it?

706
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:23,337
How can everything end so easily,
isn't it?

707
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:26,942
Yes. Now l remember.

708
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:31,181
Where's your CBl team, Prince?

709
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:33,689
They haven't arrived
yet to arrest me.

710
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:40,018
What was the name of that officer?
-Khan.

711
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:46,693
CBl officer, Ali Khan.

712
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:49,396
He hasn't arrived. -PK.

713
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:51,764
The police should've arrived
on time, sir.

714
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,699
After all,
how long can we criminals wait?

715
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:54,810
Right, boss.

716
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:56,811
You've run enough, Prince.

717
01:03:58,348 --> 01:03:59,975
Who will save you now?

718
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:01,107
Boss, wait.

719
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,345
Wait please, this is a fake coin.

720
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:04,484
lt's a copy.

721
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:17,992
Give back the gun, Prince.

722
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:31,809
What are you thinking, darling?

723
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:36,547
That how can Maya kill you?

724
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:41,421
But Serena can.

725
01:04:42,425 --> 01:04:43,585
Yes, Serena.

726
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:46,486
Your Serena.

727
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,788
WHO could've done
anything for you.

728
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:54,665
Give me the real coin, Prince.

729
01:04:55,438 --> 01:04:57,565
Or l'll kill you, l promise.

730
01:04:58,341 --> 01:04:59,740
Where is the real coin?

731
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:21,621
Sarang.

732
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:40,308
Come on, move.

733
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:00,661
Watch out!

734
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:23,520
Get them, l want them alive.

735
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,025
l want them alive.

736
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:28,122
Move, move

737
01:06:28,264 --> 01:06:29,492
Get into the car, quick.

738
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:09,498
Overtake him, catch them.

739
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,971
Come on, Prince, you can do it.

740
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:21,033
lt's show time.

741
01:09:26,242 --> 01:09:27,174
Who are you?

742
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:28,740
Maya.

743
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:33,180
Another Maya.

744
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:35,044
Another story.

745
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:39,782
So, what do you've to say?

746
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:46,319
All l want to say,
Prince, is that l love you.

747
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,327
More than my life.

748
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:52,461
l won't tell you any story.

749
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:54,769
l'll tell you the truth.

750
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:57,762
Neither are you Sarang's
right hand..

751
01:09:58,174 --> 01:10:00,165
..nor are you a CBl officer.

752
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:02,936
You and l are professional
thieves.

753
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,707
We've been working with
Sarang for many years.

754
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,175
The same old story.

755
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:12,586
New twist. lnteresting.

756
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:16,021
Go on.

757
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,826
Few months ago we decided that
we'll leave this profession.

758
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,564
And settle down.

759
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:29,835
But..it was very difficult
to do that.

760
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:33,475
Sarang's organization
is a one way street.

761
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:36,067
And there's no u-turn.

762
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:40,781
We'd only two options.

763
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:44,146
Either we kill Sarang.

764
01:10:45,354 --> 01:10:47,686
Or..get him arrested.

765
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:49,949
We chose the second option.

766
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:54,193
We contacted CBl Officer Khan.

767
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:56,893
We offered him a deal..

768
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:59,058
..that we can get Sarang arrested.

769
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:04,534
But in return we want all our past
criminal records wiped out.

770
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,603
Khan agreed.

771
01:11:08,577 --> 01:11:11,546
A few days later Sarang
gave us a job..

772
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:14,014
..of stealing an antique
gold coin.

773
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:17,777
We got the opportunity
we were waiting for.

774
01:11:18,354 --> 01:11:20,618
Attention all units,
the package is moving.

775
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,621
Be alert, l repeat, be alert.
-Copy that.

776
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:27,056
Send a request clearance
at West and Aliwell.

777
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:28,255
The plan was that..

778
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:31,800
..when we deliver the coin to
Sarang after stealing it.

779
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:35,202
..then Officer Khan would
arrest him red-handed.

780
01:11:35,538 --> 01:11:37,335
The plan was foolproof..

781
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:38,805
..as well as difficult.

782
01:11:41,977 --> 01:11:43,376
Eagle team to Alpha team.

783
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:45,008
All seems clear up here.

784
01:11:53,989 --> 01:11:55,581
Unknown elements on the bridge.

785
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:58,349
Eagle team to Alpha team.
Unknown elements on the bridge.

786
01:11:58,627 --> 01:12:00,993
Copy that.
All ground units full alert.

787
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:02,628
l repeat full alert.

788
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:07,860
Hold the convoy.

789
01:12:08,037 --> 01:12:08,935
Hold the convoy.

790
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:10,800
Alpha team, clear the bridge now.

791
01:12:11,173 --> 01:12:12,265
Move out! Move out!

792
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:13,568
Move! Move! Move!

793
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:17,642
Hey you, put your hands up
in the air right now.

794
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:19,305
Leader to Eagle One and Two.

795
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,008
Take position. Take position.

796
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,617
Eagle One coming into position.

797
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:27,213
Eagle Two coming into position.

798
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:28,515
l've a clear shot.

799
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,952
All units move up.

800
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,391
Blue team, stay with the package.

801
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:34,858
l repeat, stay with the package.

802
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:36,158
-Put your hands up in the air.

803
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:37,525
This is your final warning.

804
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,625
lt's a hologram.

805
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,199
Code red! Code red!

806
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:52,070
Eagle One and Two do
you see anything?

807
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:55,013
Speed boat approaching,
look down, under the bridge.

808
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:56,816
Copy that, take position.

809
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:58,553
Go! Go! Go! Go! -Move left!

810
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:05,754
Move! Move! Move! Take position!

811
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:28,145
The package is down!
The package is down!

812
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,151
They're getting away.
Fire at will.

813
01:13:56,912 --> 01:13:59,540
Eagle one, do you've a visual?
-Negative! Negative!

814
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,578
Do you see anything?

815
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,395
'We were successful.'

816
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:18,032
'But we didn't know
that the coin and..

817
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:21,635
..robbery will change
our lives forever.'

818
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:27,206
Go on.

819
01:14:27,276 --> 01:14:29,210
l won't tell you anything else,
Prince.

820
01:14:30,312 --> 01:14:33,907
CBl Officer Khan will tell
you the rest of the story.

821
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,595
You should've let me kill him,
Sarang.

822
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:51,026
Why did you stop me?

823
01:14:52,401 --> 01:14:55,529
Serena, don't make it
personal..ever again.

824
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:58,630
Until we don't find
the real coin..

825
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:00,470
..he has to stay alive.

826
01:15:00,843 --> 01:15:02,538
He'll to die.

827
01:15:03,145 --> 01:15:04,612
You've loved him for two years.

828
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:06,741
So hate him for a few days.

829
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:10,517
You've just heard him sigh.

830
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:13,847
He still has to bear
a lot of pain .

831
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:16,351
Lose a lot of blood.

832
01:15:29,104 --> 01:15:30,867
Okay, Charlie, let's discuss
this in private.

833
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,031
Let's discuss this in the
common room. -Okay.

834
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,106
Hello, Prince.

835
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:45,045
l feel l'll have to introduce
myself again.

836
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:47,452
Khan, Ali Khan.

837
01:15:52,227 --> 01:15:53,854
Actually, we're very old enemies..

838
01:15:53,996 --> 01:15:55,987
..or shall l say friends.

839
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:00,627
But this isn't the time
to rake up the past.

840
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:04,335
Seeing your condition
l'm assured..

841
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:07,865
..that Sarang has used
the coin on you.

842
01:16:13,816 --> 01:16:14,714
Just one question.

843
01:16:17,753 --> 01:16:19,220
What the bloody hell is this coin?

844
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:22,547
l'll tell you. Come.

845
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,251
Lights.

846
01:16:29,264 --> 01:16:31,357
The biography of this coin
starts from here.

847
01:16:32,401 --> 01:16:35,529
Date, 24th August, 2001 .

848
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:39,471
Place, Gwalior's Defence
Research Laboratory.

849
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:43,942
Characters, a team of chosen
scientists from the country..

850
01:16:44,613 --> 01:16:47,639
..who were secretly carrying out
research on Nano technology.

851
01:16:47,783 --> 01:16:50,752
And the most proficient amongst
them was him, Mr. Ram.

852
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,912
After 8 years, Mr. Ram attained
success in his mission.

853
01:16:55,557 --> 01:16:56,854
The mission belonged
to the l-GRlP.

854
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:59,953
l-GRlP had spent millions on it.

855
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:02,293
What was Mr. Ram working on?

856
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:05,326
Mr. Ram was making a path
breaking memory chip.

857
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:08,064
Through this chip human memory..

858
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,297
..can be extracted on
a computer disk.

859
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:14,471
lt can be altered and
re-implanted in human brain again.

860
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,702
Putting it in simple terms..

861
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,409
..it means that through
this chip..

862
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,540
..you can change a man's thinking.

863
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:24,618
The memory of enemies
can be altered..

864
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:26,855
..and compel him to believe that..

865
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:29,523
..he's our friend and not enemy.

866
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:31,759
The memory of a super
intelligent person..

867
01:17:31,827 --> 01:17:33,624
..can be implanted into thousands
of other people..

868
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:36,027
..and they all can be made
super-intelligent.

869
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:37,996
A criminal's memory
can be altered..

870
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,567
..and he can be turned
into a nice man.

871
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,468
The possibilities were immense.

872
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,663
And also for the country's
defense.

873
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:50,376
How..how can that happen?
-lt has happened, Prince.

874
01:17:51,346 --> 01:17:52,278
With you.

875
01:17:54,516 --> 01:17:55,847
Two weeks ago when Mr. Ram..

876
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:58,614
..was to make a presentation
of this chip to l-GRlP..

877
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:01,948
..but instead his dead
body was found.

878
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:04,321
And the chip and its software
were missing.

879
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,256
According to the team's
investigation..

880
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,153
..this was the job
of his assistant.

881
01:18:09,698 --> 01:18:11,666
He stole the chip and had
fled to South Africa.

882
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:14,602
l-GRlP's intelligence found out..

883
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:19,697
..that he has struck a deal
with someone called Sherry.

884
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:21,772
Sherry is a famous
antique dealer..

885
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:23,242
..who operates from Cape Town.

886
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:26,240
And Sarang's biggest
rival as well.

887
01:18:27,483 --> 01:18:30,316
He deals in defence secrets
and arms-smuggling.

888
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,979
Sherry knew what this
chip was worth.

889
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,680
He sent word to his international
buyers..

890
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:36,348
..about this chip.

891
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:39,527
And made an intelligent
plan to sell it.

892
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:40,892
Sherry would often sell
defence secrets..

893
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:41,861
..covertly in his priceless
antiques..

894
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,160
..through auctions in Durban.

895
01:18:44,733 --> 01:18:49,568
And that's why he.. -He hid this
chip in a antique coin.

896
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:50,570
Exactly.

897
01:18:51,073 --> 01:18:53,200
The plan was that chip
was to be sold..

898
01:18:53,408 --> 01:18:55,933
..in Durban's auction.

899
01:18:56,178 --> 01:18:57,509
So that the deal is official and..

900
01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:00,514
..the buyers can easily take
the chip out of the country.

901
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,417
Sherry arranged to send the coin..

902
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:05,714
..from Cape Town to Durban along
with his other antiques..

903
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:08,551
..under the protection
of the local police.

904
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:10,653
Sherry's plan was good..

905
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:15,489
..but he didn't have one thing
which his biggest rival had.

906
01:19:19,234 --> 01:19:20,326
You two.

907
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:24,261
The most cunning and professional
thieves in the world.

908
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:26,673
When we stole the coin
we didn't know..

909
01:19:26,742 --> 01:19:29,006
..what was inside it.

910
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:31,772
The coin was in our hands..

911
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:36,779
..and Serena was standing
before us.

912
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:40,488
Either Sarang grew
suspicious of us..

913
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:43,390
..or he didn't want to take
any chance with the coin.

914
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,050
That was the reason..

915
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,794
..why we couldn't contact
Officer Khan.

916
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:53,794
We didn't know that fate will
play a cruel game with us..

917
01:19:54,536 --> 01:20:00,475
..that will change our past,
present and our future.

918
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:06,607
You should only play the
games you can win.

919
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:10,677
Whatever the game..

920
01:20:11,587 --> 01:20:12,747
..you should know how to win.

921
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,494
Let's shake hands.

922
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:33,598
The coin is in my hand,
the cash is in yours.

923
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:42,742
At the moment,
everything is in my hands.

924
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:46,979
Coin.

925
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:09,539
Prince, my number one man.

926
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:14,105
What deal has officer
Khan offered you..

927
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:15,308
..to get me arrested?

928
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,054
l want to shoot you right now.

929
01:21:22,557 --> 01:21:24,252
But when a weapon becomes rusty..

930
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:29,330
..we don't break the weapon,
we clean it.

931
01:21:30,365 --> 01:21:32,094
You've done a greatjob for me,
Prince..

932
01:21:32,968 --> 01:21:34,128
..by stealing this chip.

933
01:21:36,505 --> 01:21:37,597
You know what this chip is?

934
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:42,602
l can make the entire world bow
at my feet with this chip.

935
01:21:42,711 --> 01:21:44,941
l can rewrite lives with it.

936
01:21:45,347 --> 01:21:46,405
Starting with you.

937
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:48,508
Mike.

938
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:05,523
Today l'll clear the
rust in your head.

939
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:09,894
Erase all of Maya's memory
from his mind.

940
01:22:11,373 --> 01:22:13,136
Don't leave anything, Mike.

941
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:19,845
l want a Prince that lives
only for Sarang.

942
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:23,743
Every step he takes is for me!

943
01:22:24,619 --> 01:22:28,282
l want Prince..my number one man,.

944
01:22:42,938 --> 01:22:43,996
Mike, don't!

945
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:47,775
Don't do this,
Sarang, you'll regret it.

946
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:50,269
Relax, Maya.

947
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:55,815
lt's my turn to say to
you lts show time.

948
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,982
We..we're ready, sir.

949
01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:34,813
Take a look, Maya.

950
01:23:35,223 --> 01:23:38,920
Prince has lost all
memories of you.

951
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,621
Next time when he wakes up..

952
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:50,161
..you won't be part of his
memory or his world.

953
01:23:57,712 --> 01:23:58,906
Stop!

954
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,174
Nobody moves.

955
01:24:00,816 --> 01:24:02,283
Give me the chip, Prince.

956
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:05,343
You're making a big mistake.

957
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,217
You're making the mistake, Sarang.

958
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,057
Maya was right.

959
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:12,219
You'll regret it.

960
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,294
Move.

961
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:31,363
Come on, move ahead.

962
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:03,831
Move ahead.

963
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:10,339
Keep moving. Keep moving.

964
01:26:15,216 --> 01:26:16,308
Go.

965
01:26:29,864 --> 01:26:31,126
No!

966
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:41,842
Prince!

967
01:26:55,056 --> 01:26:56,523
Before we separated..

968
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:59,954
..we'd decided that we'll
meet at the beach house.

969
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:03,754
But when l reached
there l saw that..

970
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:06,223
..P.K was already there.

971
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:09,829
l understood that Sarang has
still not found the coin.

972
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,801
They were still looking
for that coin.

973
01:27:13,608 --> 01:27:14,870
l kept observing you slyly..

974
01:27:14,976 --> 01:27:18,343
..so that you aren't in
danger from Sarang.

975
01:27:19,047 --> 01:27:22,073
And waited for the right
moment to contact you.

976
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,386
That means l remembered
everything..

977
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:29,514
..even after we separated.

978
01:27:30,759 --> 01:27:34,627
But..Mike had erased my memory
with the help of that chip.

979
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:38,063
Just like after deleting software
from a computer..

980
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:42,868
..we need to restart the computer
to clear all the traces.

981
01:27:44,072 --> 01:27:44,970
Similarly..

982
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:49,172
..you'd an image of your memory
in your brain at that time.

983
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:52,570
When you slept at night and
woke up in the morning..

984
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:57,013
..all the images were cleared.

985
01:27:57,519 --> 01:27:59,350
lts notjust the question
of that coin any longer..

986
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:01,789
..its also concerns the national
security now, Prince.

987
01:28:01,856 --> 01:28:03,585
And now you're a part
of it as well.

988
01:28:08,763 --> 01:28:11,561
Do you think he has met Khan?

989
01:28:13,368 --> 01:28:15,063
l know he has met Khan.

990
01:28:17,572 --> 01:28:19,802
Then he must've found
out everything.

991
01:28:22,143 --> 01:28:23,405
lf he knew everything..

992
01:28:23,478 --> 01:28:25,241
..he would've come running to me.

993
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:29,444
Because if he doesn't
come see me..

994
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:34,485
..then tomorrow will be
Prince's the last day.

995
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,030
Prince.

996
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:49,500
There's something l didn't
tell Officer Khan.

997
01:28:51,072 --> 01:28:54,064
That day you sent me a voice mail.

998
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,275
Maya. l'm safe.

999
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:01,942
l've hidden the coin.

1000
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:03,941
Gandhiji's looking after it.

1001
01:29:04,185 --> 01:29:06,380
Maya, remember the letters.

1002
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:09,184
But.. what does it mean?

1003
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:16,430
l sent this message
from some landline.

1004
01:29:17,599 --> 01:29:19,123
lt must be a payphone.

1005
01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:21,225
We should track it down.

1006
01:29:21,302 --> 01:29:22,701
l've already tracked it down.

1007
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:24,868
This phone booth is
on Osborne Road.

1008
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:26,597
Let's go.

1009
01:29:43,658 --> 01:29:46,650
Maya, in the message l said..

1010
01:29:48,396 --> 01:29:50,489
..l've handed over the
coin to Gandhiji.

1011
01:29:52,233 --> 01:29:54,030
Nelson Mandela is considered..

1012
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:56,093
..the Mahatma Gandhi
of South Africa.

1013
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:57,899
Right?

1014
01:29:58,706 --> 01:30:00,173
Maybe the coin is inside this.

1015
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:04,436
Okay, l suggest that you
go out and keep a watch.

1016
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,508
l'll open this.

1017
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:25,758
The coin isn't in these.

1018
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:35,642
This is our arms room.

1019
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:39,411
And this is where we've planned
all our high-tech robberies.

1020
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:43,046
Thank God you didn't
tell P.K about this.

1021
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:52,424
Prince. That's no ordinary lC.

1022
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:56,028
They're high-power
tracking devices.

1023
01:30:59,467 --> 01:31:03,096
And this is the.. receiver.

1024
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:13,072
Come on, move.
-Jack, check in the kitchen.

1025
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:14,239
One guy go inside.

1026
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,487
Yes. -Boss, you were right.

1027
01:31:20,989 --> 01:31:22,479
Maya and Prince were coming here.

1028
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:24,615
We followed them as well, but..
-But you lost them.

1029
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:26,057
Right, boss.

1030
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:28,095
lf you don't find
them by morning..

1031
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,288
..then you'll be missing as well.

1032
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:34,466
Come on, guys, let's go find them.

1033
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:35,660
Come on, move it.

1034
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:48,110
There's a small thing hidden
in this big city.

1035
01:31:49,484 --> 01:31:50,644
And everyone's after it.

1036
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:56,216
You'll.. find it.

1037
01:31:57,225 --> 01:31:58,123
Okay.

1038
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:03,720
What does this coin look like?

1039
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:05,633
How does it look?

1040
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,059
Just like the fake one.

1041
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:11,800
Which you gave Sarang. -Right.

1042
01:32:15,443 --> 01:32:19,243
But, why did l hide that
fake coin in my shoes?

1043
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:21,012
Not you, l did.

1044
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:23,410
l kept that fake coin there.

1045
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:26,244
You?

1046
01:32:26,888 --> 01:32:29,288
Serena had weaved her web
of deceit all around you!

1047
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:32,426
You believed that she was Maya.

1048
01:32:33,394 --> 01:32:35,453
You would've have never
believed me..

1049
01:32:36,497 --> 01:32:38,590
..if l'd contacted you
at that moment.

1050
01:32:39,767 --> 01:32:42,429
That's why l hid that fake
coin in your shoe.

1051
01:32:45,273 --> 01:32:46,831
But it was late.

1052
01:32:49,377 --> 01:32:50,674
Too late.

1053
01:33:08,629 --> 01:33:09,857
l promise you, Maya.

1054
01:33:12,367 --> 01:33:13,800
l'll find that coin.

1055
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:17,869
For you.

1056
01:33:20,074 --> 01:33:21,234
Good morning, Prince.

1057
01:33:32,186 --> 01:33:33,619
Don't be so surprised.

1058
01:33:35,423 --> 01:33:38,915
l was waiting for you to get up.

1059
01:33:39,394 --> 01:33:40,418
How do you say this?

1060
01:33:40,795 --> 01:33:41,727
Life is too short.

1061
01:33:42,397 --> 01:33:45,264
You must know everything about
the brain-mapper now.

1062
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:46,856
Everything.

1063
01:33:47,602 --> 01:33:49,627
But there's one defect
that still remains.

1064
01:33:50,004 --> 01:33:51,494
And the effect of that defect is..

1065
01:33:51,773 --> 01:33:54,071
..that your memory
is erased each..

1066
01:33:54,175 --> 01:33:56,541
..time you wake up
from your sleep.

1067
01:33:58,046 --> 01:33:59,570
And the symptoms of this
memory erasure are..

1068
01:33:59,647 --> 01:34:02,741
..nausea,
temporary blindness and headache.

1069
01:34:03,017 --> 01:34:05,850
And if your memory isn't
reloaded in your brain..

1070
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,788
..then your brain will keep
crashing like this.

1071
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:11,551
lt can lead to brain hemorrhage.

1072
01:34:11,626 --> 01:34:12,684
Sudden death.

1073
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,418
ln this condition you could
live for six days.

1074
01:34:15,963 --> 01:34:17,260
Today is the sixth day.

1075
01:34:17,565 --> 01:34:20,659
ln fact,
you've only eight hours left now.

1076
01:34:22,437 --> 01:34:23,404
Find the coin..

1077
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:25,402
And take your memory back from me.

1078
01:34:26,707 --> 01:34:27,935
l'll not kill you, Prince,

1079
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:30,107
Just give me the coin.

1080
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,113
Prince. l don't you want to die.

1081
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:43,652
At least,
you not without your memories.

1082
01:34:58,072 --> 01:34:59,403
What are you doing, Prince?

1083
01:35:01,676 --> 01:35:03,735
Mahatma Gandhi Post Office.

1084
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:05,668
Osborne Road.

1085
01:35:06,614 --> 01:35:07,945
lt's on the same road.

1086
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:12,920
Mahatma Gandhi Post Office,
in Durban?

1087
01:35:13,187 --> 01:35:15,883
Maya, l think this could be it.

1088
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:18,550
We should go check it out.

1089
01:35:36,611 --> 01:35:40,012
Maya.
All the safe-deposit lockers..

1090
01:35:40,114 --> 01:35:41,604
..have six digit numbers on them.

1091
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:43,914
Every locker has six numbers.

1092
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:48,050
l said in my message that
Ghandhiji's looking after it.

1093
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:52,417
And Remembers the letters.

1094
01:35:52,627 --> 01:35:53,821
Right? -Right.

1095
01:35:54,495 --> 01:35:59,455
Gandhi. Six letters.

1096
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:02,260
Give me your phone.

1097
01:36:02,436 --> 01:36:03,562
Quick.

1098
01:36:08,509 --> 01:36:13,879
Gandhi.

1099
01:36:17,218 --> 01:36:18,617
426344.

1100
01:36:19,554 --> 01:36:22,352
We're looking for 426344.

1101

Come, let's go.

1115
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:09,790

heart, just for you.

Don't ever leave me.

1126

The imbued night.

1127

ln your company,
l feel intoxicated.

1128
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:25,765
Let's erase these distances.

1129
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,809
Come closer to me.

1130
01:39:29,543 --> 01:39:32,637
Touch me slowly.

1131
01:39:33,114 --> 01:39:36,743
Let me be forlorn in your love.

1132
01:39:36,951 --> 01:39:40,284

Your fragrance is all around.

ln my search for life.

1139
01:40:13,654 --> 01:40:20,617
Every moment.. l felt you close.

1140
01:40:20,961 --> 01:40:28,060
My dreams gestured me..

1141
01:40:28,836 --> 01:40:32,169
l'll feel relieved.

1142
01:40:32,573 --> 01:40:35,667

1143
01:40:39,647 --> 01:40:41,046

With tearful eyes and heavy
heart, just for you.

1153
01:41:28,629 --> 01:41:29,596
Prince.

1154
01:41:33,801 --> 01:41:34,825
Sweet.

1155
01:41:37,605 --> 01:41:39,197
The road ends here, Prince.

1156
01:41:43,143 --> 01:41:46,544
The coin, please.

1157
01:42:08,035 --> 01:42:09,002
Prince.

1158
01:42:09,336 --> 01:42:11,065
Prince. Prince. Prince.

1159
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:13,368
Sarang did a terrible
thing with you.

1160
01:42:13,741 --> 01:42:17,472
lf it had been me.. lt would've
been far worse for you.

1161
01:42:21,715 --> 01:42:23,410
Sherry. -Good.

1162
01:42:24,618 --> 01:42:26,916
Now l don't have to
tell Prince that..

1163
01:42:27,021 --> 01:42:29,615
..you stole that coin from me.

1164
01:42:30,824 --> 01:42:32,985
Come on, Prince, be a good boy.

1165
01:42:33,894 --> 01:42:35,623
And give me my coin back.

1166
01:42:37,998 --> 01:42:42,401
One arrow and two targets.

1167
01:42:44,438 --> 01:42:45,496
Maya.

1168
01:42:47,241 --> 01:42:48,299
Guys, get ready.

1169
01:43:20,674 --> 01:43:21,732
Maya!

1170
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:23,168
Maya!

1171
01:43:24,812 --> 01:43:26,439
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1172
01:44:07,721 --> 01:44:08,745
Come on, move.

1173
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:11,581
Come on, hurry up.

1174
01:44:56,103 --> 01:44:58,094
Hurry up, come on, move, move.

1175
01:47:46,273 --> 01:47:47,365
No!

1176
01:47:48,408 --> 01:47:49,466
Prince!

1177
01:48:34,087 --> 01:48:35,179
Darn.

1178
01:49:03,717 --> 01:49:05,685
Bloody hell. -What happened?

1179
01:49:06,086 --> 01:49:07,246
He doesn't have the coin.

1180
01:49:08,655 --> 01:49:10,748
We didn't find the coin and
abducted Prince as well.

1181
01:49:12,192 --> 01:49:13,454
lf he doesn't have the coin..

1182
01:49:14,194 --> 01:49:15,456
..then Maya must have it.

1183
01:49:15,929 --> 01:49:18,898
And Maya will give us the
coin to save her Prince.

1184
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:21,590
Yes, she'll give the coin.

1185
01:49:21,768 --> 01:49:23,861
And one day, she and Prince
together will kill us.

1186
01:49:25,505 --> 01:49:26,563
Will you shut up?

1187
01:49:27,107 --> 01:49:29,371
Sherry was going to pay us
100 million for that coin.

1188
01:49:29,476 --> 01:49:31,307
Sherry. Sherry is dead. -So what?

1189
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:32,503
Now Sarang will pay us.

1190
01:49:54,468 --> 01:49:57,835
Serena, where are they?
-They fled.

1191
01:49:58,271 --> 01:49:59,329
Let's go.

1192
01:50:08,648 --> 01:50:09,945
Mike.

1193
01:50:10,617 --> 01:50:11,584
Hello, Mike.

1194
01:50:11,718 --> 01:50:15,347
No, Priya. l know you've the coin.

1195
01:50:15,989 --> 01:50:17,547
But before you go to Sarang..

1196
01:50:18,258 --> 01:50:21,159
..you'll have to come to me.

1197
01:50:21,261 --> 01:50:22,558
Sarang has the brain-mapper.

1198
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:24,720
What do you've? -Me?

1199
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,333
l've Prince.

1200
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:40,168
Maya, where are you?

1201
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:42,510
Officer Khan,
l've found their location.

1202
01:50:43,283 --> 01:50:44,477
Maya, we need the coin.

1203
01:50:44,551 --> 01:50:45,677
You'll get it.

1204
01:50:45,752 --> 01:50:47,117
But first l need to save Prince.

1205
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:50,253
The location is.. -Just a second.

1206
01:50:50,657 --> 01:50:52,648
Okay. -Yes, tell me.

1207
01:50:52,726 --> 01:50:54,353
Ushaka Sea World. Sea Point.

1208
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:55,519
Two of them.

1209
01:50:55,595 --> 01:50:57,119
Okay,
Maya, we'll be there in a while.

1210
01:50:57,330 --> 01:50:58,456
You just hold fort, okay.

1211
01:51:00,133 --> 01:51:02,397
Found them. Let's go.

1212
01:51:37,037 --> 01:51:39,471
The coin. And your gun.

1213
01:51:39,906 --> 01:51:43,000
First tell me how you can
save Prince's life?

1214
01:51:43,376 --> 01:51:45,401
l've a copy of the brain-mapper
software.

1215
01:51:45,612 --> 01:51:47,807
Which l took from Sarang's laptop.

1216
01:51:47,948 --> 01:51:49,677
lt's the question
of Prince's life.

1217
01:51:51,551 --> 01:51:52,677
How can l trust you?

1218
01:51:52,752 --> 01:51:54,344
You've to, Maya. You've to.

1219
01:51:54,621 --> 01:51:56,350
Sarang wanted to kill Prince..

1220
01:51:56,423 --> 01:51:57,890
..as soon as he got the coin.

1221
01:51:58,492 --> 01:52:00,858
l made this copy to
save Prince's life.

1222
01:52:01,661 --> 01:52:03,060
Please, Maya, believe me.

1223
01:52:03,396 --> 01:52:04,920
Prince has very little time.

1224
01:52:10,737 --> 01:52:11,795
Gun.

1225
01:52:18,178 --> 01:52:19,110
Let me see, darling.

1226
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:24,047
The coin that's responsible for
all this, how does it look?

1227
01:52:25,519 --> 01:52:27,510
Priya.
Prince has very little time.

1228
01:52:27,787 --> 01:52:30,813
Please, Baby, l just..l
just want to see it.

1229
01:52:38,565 --> 01:52:39,657
Thank you.

1230
01:52:43,603 --> 01:52:44,729
What are you doing, Priya?

1231
01:52:44,804 --> 01:52:45,998
Give me back the coin, Priya..

1232
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:49,538
You're so stupid, Mike.

1233
01:52:50,644 --> 01:52:51,770
What did you think..

1234
01:52:52,646 --> 01:52:55,740
..a girl like me can fall in
love with an idiot like you?

1235
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:04,016
There's just one idiot
in this room.

1236
01:53:05,358 --> 01:53:06,825
And that's not me.

1237
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,021
l'll shoot if l've to.

1238
01:53:09,629 --> 01:53:10,721
Bye, loser.

1239
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,766
Priya was right.

1240
01:53:22,142 --> 01:53:23,370
You're a loser, Mike.

1241
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:26,806
Don't worry, Maya, Prince
will be absolutely fine.

1242
01:53:27,847 --> 01:53:30,839
l'm not a loser,
l've the real coin.

1243
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,423
l'd learnt about Priya's
greed long time back.

1244
01:53:39,192 --> 01:53:40,591
So, which coin was that?

1245
01:53:40,961 --> 01:53:43,156
The same duplicate coin
that you gave Prince..

1246
01:53:43,396 --> 01:53:44,556
..and Prince gave to Sarang.

1247
01:53:45,899 --> 01:53:48,891
lf l can steal the entire
brain-mapper software..

1248
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,128
..from Sarang's laptop,
can't l steal a coin?

1249
01:53:56,309 --> 01:53:57,401
Okay.

1250
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:01,438
This is it.

1251
01:54:01,948 --> 01:54:03,006
Here goes.

1252
01:54:18,598 --> 01:54:21,158
You're incomplete without
your memory, Prince.

1253
01:54:21,735 --> 01:54:23,100
And l'm incomplete without you.

1254
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:25,494
Come back, Prince.

1255
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:30,205
Or else..or else,
we'll lose this battle.

1256
01:54:33,813 --> 01:54:35,440
Come back, Prince.

1257
01:54:36,616 --> 01:54:37,708
Please.

1258
01:54:38,518 --> 01:54:39,610
Come back, Prince.

1259
01:54:41,554 --> 01:54:42,612
Come on.

1260
01:54:57,737 --> 01:54:58,829
Come on, Prince.

1261
01:54:59,739 --> 01:55:00,797
Come back.

1262
01:55:06,346 --> 01:55:14,253
Maya. -Please. Come back.

1263
01:55:20,694 --> 01:55:23,686
Mike. Save me.

1264
01:55:26,933 --> 01:55:27,991
Priya!

1265
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:41,438
No!

1266
01:55:44,017 --> 01:55:45,211
Maya, no. Maya.

1267
01:55:51,958 --> 01:55:53,152
No!

1268
01:55:59,532 --> 01:56:01,295
You'd one chance to live.

1269
01:56:02,268 --> 01:56:04,930
But,
maybe, you're in a hurry to die.

1270
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:14,068
Serena.

1271
01:56:57,457 --> 01:56:59,948
Sarang, we know you're here.

1272
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,651
But there's no escape
for you this time.

1273
01:57:03,396 --> 01:57:04,294
Do you hear me?

1274
01:57:04,631 --> 01:57:06,155
No escape Sarang.

1275
01:57:07,066 --> 01:57:08,158
Put your hands up.

1276
01:57:09,135 --> 01:57:10,466
And come out, one by one.

1277
01:57:23,817 --> 01:57:24,909
Go, go.

1278
01:57:29,556 --> 01:57:30,420
Wait.

1279
01:57:48,074 --> 01:57:49,200
Prince.

1280
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:53,574
Prince..l..l..

1281
01:57:54,981 --> 01:57:56,141
l'm sorry.

1282
01:58:00,987 --> 01:58:02,147
Sarang, Prince.

1283
01:58:04,757 --> 01:58:05,655
Let him go.

1284
01:58:05,992 --> 01:58:07,152
We've the coin.

1285
01:58:07,727 --> 01:58:08,625
Go.

1286
01:58:31,551 --> 01:58:32,848
They've reduced firing.

1287
01:58:33,786 --> 01:58:35,777
Looks like they're running
out of bullets

1288
01:58:35,922 --> 01:58:36,911
No, Sarang is fleeing.

1289
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:38,116
From behind.

1290
01:59:19,265 --> 01:59:20,527
Don't worry, Prince.

1291
01:59:22,035 --> 01:59:24,435
We'll soon find out
Sarang's location.

1292
01:59:25,838 --> 01:59:27,328
Colonel Khanna has gone after him.

1293
01:59:29,309 --> 01:59:33,302
Colonel Khanna didn't go after
him. He went with him.

1294
01:59:35,315 --> 01:59:36,441
What the..

1295
01:59:38,451 --> 01:59:39,440
Blanks.

1296
01:59:40,553 --> 01:59:43,545
There were no bullets in
any of l-GRlPs' guns.

1297
02:00:37,377 --> 02:00:39,436
That means we were wrong.

1298
02:00:39,545 --> 02:00:40,739
We were wrong the whole time.

1299
02:00:43,016 --> 02:00:44,881
Sarang had already bribed Khanna.

1300
02:00:45,718 --> 02:00:47,515
He'd all the details.

1301
02:00:48,154 --> 02:00:49,621
He knew bloody everything.

1302
02:00:51,891 --> 02:00:54,155
And now..now we've lost him.

1303
02:00:54,894 --> 02:00:58,261
Trust us, Officer Khan,
we'll find him. -How?

1304
02:01:00,033 --> 02:01:01,864
We just won't be able
to find him now.

1305
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:06,297
We'll.

1306
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:12,509
Wherever Sarang has gone,
he must have worn his shoes.

1307
02:01:30,596 --> 02:01:33,224
l'm sorry, but sometimes..

1308
02:01:33,332 --> 02:01:35,425
..good news comes to those
who wait for it.

1309
02:01:36,669 --> 02:01:37,829
Do you've the coin? -Yes.

1310
02:01:38,204 --> 02:01:40,399
And very soon you shall have it.

1311
02:01:57,824 --> 02:01:58,882
Sarang. -Yes.

1312
02:01:59,592 --> 02:02:00,854
Where are we going?

1313
02:02:02,395 --> 02:02:03,453
ls it safe?

1314
02:02:03,963 --> 02:02:07,831
l'm safe.
Don't know about you. -What?

1315
02:02:08,101 --> 02:02:09,125
Just kidding.

1316
02:02:12,572 --> 02:02:14,005
Look outside, Khanna.

1317
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:15,566
This is Sharakiya.

1318
02:02:15,808 --> 02:02:18,504
The point between the border of
Pakistan and Afghanistan..

1319
02:02:18,945 --> 02:02:21,038
..which is no-man's land..
But belongs to everyone..

1320
02:02:21,614 --> 02:02:24,606
..there's a base-camp located
seven kilometres from here.

1321
02:02:28,788 --> 02:02:30,050
Here you can find every weapon..

1322
02:02:30,123 --> 02:02:31,590
..from every country.

1323
02:02:32,191 --> 02:02:33,886
But no weapon of any country..

1324
02:02:34,026 --> 02:02:36,620
..can locate us here.

1325
02:02:41,434 --> 02:02:43,834
Tell Khanna that Prince can
locate you anywhere.

1326
02:02:44,137 --> 02:02:46,605
How did you find out
about my location?

1327
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:52,041
Ask your shoe, Sarang. -Shoe?

1328
02:02:58,217 --> 02:02:59,616
lt's show time.

1329
02:03:58,511 --> 02:03:59,569
Rogue.

1330
02:04:00,246 --> 02:04:03,807
Sarang, coin.

1331
02:06:08,774 --> 02:06:10,708
Captain, down, down.

1332
02:06:33,799 --> 02:06:35,426
Prince!
