00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:27.582
Okay, game point. 15-14.
This team serves.

2
00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:29.582
Let's go. Service!

3
00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:31.582
Come on! Come on!

4
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:38.582
Keep it up! Let's go!
Teamwork! Keep playing!

5
00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:45.249
Hit it to Carrie!
She'll blow it!

6
00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:47.082
Don't blow it, Carrie! Hit it!

7
00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:51.582
- Carrie...!
- She blew it again!

8
00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:53.582
We almost had the game!

9
00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:56.582
We can't win a game
with her on the team.

10
00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:58.832
Look at her!
Just standing there!

11
00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:01.416
You eat shit!

12
00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:31.582
Help me! Help me!

13
00:04:31.582 --> 00:04:33.582
Help me!

14
00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:35.166
Aah!

15
00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:37.582
Help me! Help me!

16
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.582
Have a Tampax!

17
00:04:39.957 --> 00:04:41.082
Help me!

18
00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:43.582
Hey Norma,
Carrie's got her period!

19
00:04:45.582 --> 00:04:47.582
Help me! Help me!

20
00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:51.249
Help me!

21
00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:54.916
Gross! Gross!

22
00:04:56.874 --> 00:05:00.582
Carrie! Here!
Plug it up! Plug it up!

23
00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:04.582
Plug it up! Plug it up!

24
00:05:04.582 --> 00:05:06.624
Plug it up! Plug it up!

25
00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:09.124
Plug it up! Plug it up!

26
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:10.707
Plug it up! Plug it up!

27
00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:12.916
Plug it up! Plug it up!

28
00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:14.749
Plug it up! Plug it up!

29
00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:17.582
What is going on? This isn't
a pep rally. What's happening?

30
00:05:17.582 --> 00:05:19.457
Plug it up! Plug it up!

31
00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:21.124
Plug it up! Plug it up!

32
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:23.124
Plug it up! Plug it up!

33
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.291
Plug it up!

34
00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.582
Sue! What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

35
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.582
Carrie...
she just got her period!

36
00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:30.957
- Who's got her period?
- Carrie.

37
00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:32.582
What are you doing?!

38
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.582
Plug it up! Plug it up!

39
00:05:34.582 --> 00:05:36.582
Plug it up! Plug it up!

40
00:05:36.582 --> 00:05:38.374
Plug it up! Plug it up!

41
00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:41.041
Carrie! Come on, Carrie!
Jesus, Carrie!

42
00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.291
Carrie, sweetheart!
Jesus! Come on!

43
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:47.916
Stop it! Now relax! Calm down.
Listen to me. Listen.

44
00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:49.582
I it's okay. It's okay.
Now you're just going to

45
00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.874
stand up and take care
of yourself. Now, come on. Come on.

46
00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:53.916
Grow up. Stand up and take care
of yourself.

47
00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:55.582
Come on, do it. Do it.

48
00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:56.582
- Do it!
- Aah!

49
00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:00.582
Did you see that?

50
00:06:00.582 --> 00:06:02.582
No...!

51
00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:06.916
Get out of here.
Go on. Right now. Move!

52
00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.166
Carrie...

53
00:06:16.582 --> 00:06:21.582
Carrie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know, okay? I'm sorry.

54
00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:24.207
Baby, come on, now.
Don't you know?

55
00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:26.041
Listen. Listen.

56
00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.582
I'm gonna talk to you about it, now, okay?
Now just calm down. Just relax.

57
00:06:30.582 --> 00:06:33.582
See? They're all gone. They're all gone.

58
00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.582
Now, listen.
It's gonna be okay.

59
00:06:50.374 --> 00:06:54.582
- Isn't she a bit old for her, uh...
- Her first period.

60
00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:56.582
Um... yes.

61
00:06:58.582 --> 00:07:03.291
Morty, until a half-hour ago, I don't even
think she knew there was such a thing.

62
00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:09.124
It's really... hard to believe
in this day and age

63
00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:10.749
a girl in high school
wouldn't know something.

64
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.957
Uh, facts...

65
00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:14.624
Well, she didn't.

66
00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:18.582
But I don't know why that should surprise us,
I mean, knowing that mother of hers.

67
00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:23.166
- We can't interfere with people's beliefs.
- I know, I know.

68
00:07:23.624 --> 00:07:26.582
- As for the girls...
- Carrie's always been their scapegoat.

69
00:07:26.582 --> 00:07:28.374
- You've got to do something.
- I will.

70
00:07:30.207 --> 00:07:33.291
But see, the thing is, Morty, that, um...

71
00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:35.082
I knew how they felt.

72
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:39.041
See, the whole thing just made me
wanna take her and shake her, too.

73
00:07:39.832 --> 00:07:41.166
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

74
00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:45.499
- It was just her period, for God's sake!
- Well, we'll send her home.

75
00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:48.707
Miss Finch,
will you send in Cassie Wright?

76
00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:49.916
It's Carrie White.

77
00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:56.916
Come in, Cassie.

78
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:58.291
Carrie.

79
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:01.874
Miss Finch, would you
bring in a dismissal slip?

80
00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.916
I thought you might take
the rest of the day

81
00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:08.916
and go home,
take care of yourself, Cassie.

82
00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:16.332
We're all very sorry
about this incident.

83
00:08:23.207 --> 00:08:24.207
It's Carrie.

84
00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:28.999
Thank you.

85
00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:34.916
Would you like
to go to the infirmary?

86
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:38.291
- Lie down for a while?
- I think Carrie can go home.

87
00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:46.916
Would you like a ride?
We could call you a cab.

88
00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:48.916
I'm sure she can walk home.

89
00:08:49.582 --> 00:08:53.916
And, Carrie, you're dismissed from gym
for a week. Just take study hall instead, okay?

90
00:08:56.499 --> 00:08:58.916
We're all sorry
about this incident, Cassie.

91
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:00.041
It's Carrie!

92
00:09:28.832 --> 00:09:31.207
Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie!
Ha-ha!

93
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:32.916
Ohh!

94
00:09:33.332 --> 00:09:35.291
Ohh! Ohh...

95
00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:52.457
<i>Were you in Chicago two years ago?</i>

96
00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:53.374
<i>Chicago?</i>

97
00:09:54.207 --> 00:09:56.541
<i>Yes, Bill. Chicago.</i>

98
00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.916
<i>Why, yes, I was living in Chicago.</i>

99
00:09:59.957 --> 00:10:01.916
<i>You knew that, didn't you?
I told you that, didn't I</i>

100
00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:03.916
<i>No, you didn't.
I found out.</i>

101
00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:06.916
<i>You're looking at me so, uh, strangely...</i>

102
00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:09.416
Oh, Mrs. White.

103
00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:11.916
- How have you been, Mrs. Snell?
- Fine.

104
00:10:12.249 --> 00:10:14.582
- And the doctor?
- Fine.

105
00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:18.374
- And your daughter?
- Sue is fine.

106
00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:23.582
- Won't you come in, Mrs. White?
- Oh, how kind of you.

107
00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:31.916
- I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
- Yes.

108
00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:37.291
- Perhaps sometime she might like to visit.
- I'm here on the Lord's work, Mrs. Snell.

109
00:10:37.916 --> 00:10:41.916
Spread in" the gospel of God's salvation
through Christ's blood.

110
00:10:42.582 --> 00:10:43.499
Yes, of course.

111
00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:47.249
I have something here I know is gonna
interest the doctor and you.

112
00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:51.791
The teenager's path to salvation
through the cross of Jesus.

113
00:10:51.916 --> 00:10:53.916
I don't think Sue
would be very interested.

114
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:58.249
The children are wandering through the
wilderness of sin these days, Mrs. Snell.

115
00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:00.582
My Sue is a good girl.

116
00:11:00.874 --> 00:11:02.749
These are godless times,
Mrs. Snell.

117
00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:04.499
I'll drink to that!

118
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.416
We'll... all read these.

119
00:11:08.749 --> 00:11:10.916
Excuse me.
Please sit down, Mrs. White.

120
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:14.707
Hello?

121
00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:19.124
Betty, can I call you back?
Margaret White is here.

122
00:11:20.582 --> 00:11:21.916
Are you accusing me...

123
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:22.916
White.

124
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.916
Just let me get rid of her
and I'll call you back.

125
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.916
And now... I'm going to kill you!

126
00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:36.624
I have something here, Mrs. Snell,
that I think you might profit from.

127
00:11:36.916 --> 00:11:41.124
- Look, Mrs. White, I'd like to contribute 5...
- Exodus.

128
00:11:41.832 --> 00:11:42.957
$10.

129
00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:46.832
I see.

130
00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:04.916
I pray you find Jesus.

131
00:12:12.124 --> 00:12:15.916
- Wasn't that Carrie White's mother?
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

132
00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:17.666
What did she want?

133
00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:01.916
Yes?

134
00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:05.916
Yes?

135
00:13:23.916 --> 00:13:24.916
Thank you.

136
00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:33.249
I know you're listening.

137
00:13:34.332 --> 00:13:35.624
Come on downstairs.

138
00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:54.832
Mama?

139
00:13:55.499 --> 00:13:57.916
Who was that? Who called?

140
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:08.916
You're a woman now.

141
00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.916
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

142
00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:13.457
Aah!

143
00:14:16.249 --> 00:14:18.749
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam

144
00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.916
and Eve was weak and
loosed the raven on the world.

145
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:25.916
And the raven
was called sin. Say it.

146
00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:27.916
- The raven was called sin.
- Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

147
00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:29.916
- Say it.

148
00:14:29.916 --> 00:14:31.249
The raven was called sin.

149
00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:34.166
No, Mama...
And the raven was called sin!

150
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.041
And first sin was intercourse.

151
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.291
First sin was intercourse.

152
00:14:39.624 --> 00:14:40.791
I didn't sin, Mama.

153
00:14:40.916 --> 00:14:43.624
- Say it!
- I didn't sin, Mama!

154
00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:44.916
The first sin was intercourse.

155
00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:45.916
First sin was intercourse.

156
00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:46.916
First sin was intercourse.

157
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:48.916
And the first sin
was intercourse!

158
00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:51.374
Mama, I was so scared,
I thought I was dyin'.

159
00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:53.916
And the girls,
they all laughed at me, Mama.

160
00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:56.166
- And Eve was weak. Say it.
- No, Mama!

161
00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:57.624
- Eve was weak.
- No!

162
00:14:57.624 --> 00:14:59.249
- Eve was weak.
- No!

163
00:14:59.249 --> 00:15:01.916
- Eve was weak. Say it, woman.
- No, Mama!

164
00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:02.916
Say it!

165
00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:04.249
Eve was weak!

166
00:15:04.249 --> 00:15:05.791
Eve was weak!

167
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:08.624
And the Lord visited Eve
with a curse.

168
00:15:08.832 --> 00:15:10.957
And the curse was
the curse of blood!

169
00:15:11.249 --> 00:15:15.666
You should have told me, Mama!
You should have told me!

170
00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:16.916
O Lord!

171
00:15:17.707 --> 00:15:21.207
Help the sinning woman
see the sin of her days and ways.

172
00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:26.916
Show her that if she had remained sinless
the curse of blood would never have come on her.

173
00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:28.541
She may have been tempted
by the Antichrist.

174
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:30.916
She may have completed
the sin of lustful thoughts...

175
00:15:31.082 --> 00:15:32.207
No, Mama!

176
00:15:32.207 --> 00:15:35.374
Don't lie to me, Carrietta!
Don't you know by now I can see inside you?

177
00:15:35.374 --> 00:15:37.082
I can see the sin as surely as God can!

178
00:15:37.082 --> 00:15:39.291
- Let me go, Mama. You're hurting me.
- We'll pray!

179
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.916
- No! No!
- We'll pray, woman!

180
00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:44.749
Pray to Jesus for all the lustful,
sinning souls.

181
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:45.916
No!

182
00:15:45.916 --> 00:15:49.916
God visited Eve with the curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood.

183
00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:50.916
No, Mama!

184
00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:54.291
And he visited Eve with the second curse.
And this was the curse of childbearing.

185
00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:56.916
And Eve brought forth Cain
in sweat and blood.

186
00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.041
Genesis 3:16!

187
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.416
Mama! Let me out!

188
00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:03.666
Mama, please! Let me out!

189
00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.541
Mama, please!

190
00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:08.166
Let me out, Mama! God...!

191
00:16:26.207 --> 00:16:28.457
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

192
00:16:28.457 --> 00:16:29.457
Thy kingdom...

193
00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:55.541
Thank you, Mama.

194
00:17:01.874 --> 00:17:03.082
You can go to bed now.

195
00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:43.916
There is power, power,
wonder-working power in the blood

196
00:17:44.082 --> 00:17:45.624
of the lamb...

197
00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:54.124
Carrie?

198
00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:56.707
Carrie?

199
00:18:01.707 --> 00:18:02.707
Carrie?

200
00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:09.707
Carrie?

201
00:18:09.707 --> 00:18:11.041
Carrie?

202
00:18:11.707 --> 00:18:13.041
Open the door.

203
00:18:13.707 --> 00:18:14.707
It's open, Mama.

204
00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:26.707
What was that noise?

205
00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:29.707
What noise?

206
00:18:34.624 --> 00:18:35.582
Go to bed.

207
00:18:36.499 --> 00:18:38.582
Yes, ma'am. Saying my prayers...

208
00:18:57.624 --> 00:19:02.624
"What are you going to leave
for us, you people in your big cars,

209
00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.624
spewing pollution into the air?"

210
00:19:08.124 --> 00:19:10.624
"You people with heavy feet,

211
00:19:11.207 --> 00:19:13.624
trampling down the wilderness."

212
00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:19.624
"You people who peer into
the back seats of our cars,

213
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:24.666
hours after you come out
of the back doors of your motels."

214
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:31.166
"Soon all we will have is each other."

215
00:19:31.707 --> 00:19:33.707
"And that could be enough."

216
00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:37.624
"If you will let us have room enough

217
00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:39.582
and air enough

218
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:41.749
and peace enough

219
00:19:42.624 --> 00:19:44.291
to love each other

220
00:19:45.624 --> 00:19:47.249
as you never could."

221
00:19:49.124 --> 00:19:50.124
Hm.

222
00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:53.624
I... I really must say...
I must confess

223
00:19:53.624 --> 00:19:57.624
this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.

224
00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:05.624
Talent extraordinary for you,
Tommy Ross.

225
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:08.624
You know, Tommy,

226
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:12.874
this is slightly different from running
touchdowns and hitting home runs.

227
00:20:15.624 --> 00:20:17.291
Well, class,

228
00:20:17.624 --> 00:20:19.416
any criticisms?

229
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:24.791
Anyone?

230
00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:28.624
It's beautiful.

231
00:20:33.624 --> 00:20:35.416
Carrie White!

232
00:20:36.416 --> 00:20:37.416
Beautiful.

233
00:20:38.457 --> 00:20:39.457
Beautiful.

234
00:20:41.457 --> 00:20:43.457
Beautiful!

235
00:20:45.749 --> 00:20:48.457
"Oh, beautiful for
spacious skies,

236
00:20:48.457 --> 00:20:51.457
for amber waves of grain!"

237
00:20:51.457 --> 00:20:55.457
Is that the beautiful you mean?
Is it, Carrie, hmm?

238
00:20:56.457 --> 00:20:59.457
Well, I'm afraid, Carrie,
this is hardly a criticism.

239
00:20:59.999 --> 00:21:01.374
You suck.

240
00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:06.082
Tommy?
Did you say something, Tommy?

241
00:21:06.457 --> 00:21:08.916
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

242
00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:10.457
I said, "Aw, shucks."

243
00:21:20.457 --> 00:21:21.666
Blake.

244
00:21:21.666 --> 00:21:22.457
Present.

245
00:21:22.457 --> 00:21:23.457
- Borne.
- Here.

246
00:21:23.457 --> 00:21:25.166
- Gogin.
- Present.

247
00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:26.457
- Grace.
- Here.

248
00:21:26.457 --> 00:21:27.666
- Hargenson.
- Here.

249
00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:29.457
- Litton.
- Yeah.

250
00:21:29.457 --> 00:21:31.041
- MacDermit.
- Present.

251
00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:32.457
- O'Shea.
- Present.

252
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.041
- Pollock.
- Here.

253
00:21:34.166 --> 00:21:35.457
- Shires.
- Present.

254
00:21:35.457 --> 00:21:36.791
- Snell.
- Here.

255
00:21:37.124 --> 00:21:38.457
- Watson.
- Present.

256
00:21:38.457 --> 00:21:40.249
- And the Wilsons.
- We're here.

257
00:21:40.457 --> 00:21:41.457
Okay, line up.

258
00:21:43.374 --> 00:21:44.374
Line up!

259
00:21:46.332 --> 00:21:47.332
Move it!

260
00:21:49.457 --> 00:21:52.791
On your feet right now!
Two lines!

261
00:21:55.457 --> 00:21:58.457
Alice and Mary, eyes front.

262
00:21:59.124 --> 00:22:00.457
Katie...

263
00:22:03.832 --> 00:22:04.916
You, too, Chris.

264
00:22:06.457 --> 00:22:07.707
And spit out that gum.

265
00:22:08.249 --> 00:22:11.457
- Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?
- You can choke on it for all I care.

266
00:22:11.457 --> 00:22:13.207
Just get it out of your mouth.

267
00:22:25.749 --> 00:22:28.041
Wipe that smirk
off your face, Norma.

268
00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:37.457
Okay. Now I want you all to know that
you did a really shitty thing yesterday,

269
00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:39.082
a really shitty thing.

270
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:47.457
Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?

271
00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:53.374
Do any of you
ever stop to think?

272
00:22:56.707 --> 00:23:00.457
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates

273
00:23:00.457 --> 00:23:02.416
and the prom.

274
00:23:05.249 --> 00:23:09.749
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?

275
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:11.457
Billy Nolan.

276
00:23:11.457 --> 00:23:14.457
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.

277
00:23:14.457 --> 00:23:17.041
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Could you speak up?
- Billy Nolan.

278
00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:19.249
Well, isn't he the lucky one!

279
00:23:26.791 --> 00:23:28.041
What about you, Sue?

280
00:23:29.499 --> 00:23:31.457
Who's taking you?

281
00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:33.082
Tommy Ross.

282
00:23:34.457 --> 00:23:35.457
Right.

283
00:23:42.457 --> 00:23:48.457
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled
was three days' suspension

284
00:23:48.457 --> 00:23:50.582
and refusal of
your prom tickets.

285
00:23:50.832 --> 00:23:51.999
Oh!

286
00:23:52.957 --> 00:23:53.957
What...?

287
00:23:54.957 --> 00:23:56.457
God!

288
00:23:58.249 --> 00:24:00.249
That'd get you where you live,
wouldn't it?

289
00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:02.166
And you'd deserve it.

290
00:24:04.457 --> 00:24:09.749
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.

291
00:24:12.457 --> 00:24:16.957
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.

292
00:24:22.457 --> 00:24:24.457
Still, there's one little catch.

293
00:24:25.457 --> 00:24:27.207
It's to be my detention.

294
00:24:28.457 --> 00:24:29.916
That's 50 minutes

295
00:24:30.457 --> 00:24:31.457
every day

296
00:24:31.457 --> 00:24:33.291
starting today

297
00:24:33.457 --> 00:24:35.457
on the athletic field.

298
00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:36.457
Get the picture?

299
00:24:36.457 --> 00:24:37.749
I'm not coming.

300
00:24:44.207 --> 00:24:45.374
That's up to you, Chris.

301
00:24:47.207 --> 00:24:49.207
That's up to all of you.

302
00:24:50.916 --> 00:24:53.207
Punishment for
skipping detention

303
00:24:53.207 --> 00:24:55.207
is three days' suspension

304
00:24:56.207 --> 00:24:58.207
and refusal of your prom tickets.

305
00:25:01.207 --> 00:25:02.207
Any other thoughts?

306
00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:07.207
Good. Now change up.

307
00:25:10.207 --> 00:25:11.207
Where are you going?

308
00:25:12.457 --> 00:25:15.207
- Where you going?
- Come on. Are you gonna come?

309
00:25:15.207 --> 00:25:17.207
- I'm not coming.
- You're really not gonna come?

310
00:25:17.207 --> 00:25:18.207
You're gonna miss out
on the prom for this?

311
00:25:18.207 --> 00:25:21.207
- I'm not coming.
- Well, I'm not gonna miss the prom for this.

312
00:25:22.707 --> 00:25:23.707
Fuck!

313
00:25:23.874 --> 00:25:26.207
And... 1, 2, 3, 4.

314
00:25:26.707 --> 00:25:28.541
2, 2, 3, 4

315
00:25:29.207 --> 00:25:30.749
3, 2, 3, 4.

316
00:25:31.207 --> 00:25:32.416
4, 2, 3, 4.

317
00:25:33.082 --> 00:25:33.249
5, 2...

318
00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:35.749
Energy, Norma! Come on!
Come on!

319
00:25:36.207 --> 00:25:37.207
8, 2, 3, 4

320
00:25:37.582 --> 00:25:40.207
1, 2, 3, 4.

321
00:25:40.207 --> 00:25:42.124
2, 2, 3, 4

322
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.624
3, 2, 3, 4.

323
00:25:44.207 --> 00:25:46.207
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

324
00:25:46.207 --> 00:25:48.207
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

325
00:25:48.207 --> 00:25:49.457
Stretch, Norma, stretch!

326
00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:52.207
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

327
00:25:52.207 --> 00:25:53.207
1, 2,

328
00:25:53.207 --> 00:25:55.207
bend, up.

329
00:25:55.207 --> 00:25:56.207
Bend, up.

330
00:25:56.207 --> 00:25:57.499
1, 2.

331
00:25:58.207 --> 00:25:59.207
1, 2.

332
00:25:59.207 --> 00:26:00.041
1, 2.

333
00:26:00.207 --> 00:26:01.207
Faster.

334
00:26:01.207 --> 00:26:02.207
And 1, 2.

335
00:26:02.207 --> 00:26:03.207
1, 2.

336
00:26:03.207 --> 00:26:05.207
1, 2, 1,

337
00:26:05.207 --> 00:26:07.207
and 2

338
00:26:07.374 --> 00:26:09.749
and 3

339
00:26:10.207 --> 00:26:10.749
Uhh!

340
00:26:11.207 --> 00:26:12.916
...and 4

341
00:26:13.207 --> 00:26:15.582
and 5

342
00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:18.207
and 6

343
00:26:18.207 --> 00:26:21.207
and 7

344
00:26:21.207 --> 00:26:23.624
and 8

345
00:26:24.207 --> 00:26:26.207
and 9

346
00:26:26.207 --> 00:26:28.207
and 10

347
00:26:28.207 --> 00:26:30.207
and 11

348
00:26:30.207 --> 00:26:32.207
and 12

349
00:26:32.207 --> 00:26:34.207
and 13

350
00:26:34.207 --> 00:26:36.207
and 14

351
00:26:36.207 --> 00:26:38.207
and 15.

352
00:27:11.541 --> 00:27:15.207
And...
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,

353
00:27:15.207 --> 00:27:16.207
1, 2, 1, 2,

354
00:27:16.207 --> 00:27:17.832

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:31.999
Now that's a pretty girl.

537
00:38:32.332 --> 00:38:33.332
Look at your eyes!

538
00:38:34.332 --> 00:38:37.332
Little mascara to bring it out?
Little?

539
00:38:37.332 --> 00:38:41.499
Your lips. Try some lipstick.
You have nice, pretty lips.

540
00:38:42.207 --> 00:38:43.332
And your cheekbones.

541
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:49.332
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair. You
could just put it up a little, maybe add a little curl.

542
00:38:49.332 --> 00:38:51.332
What do you think?

543
00:38:51.332 --> 00:38:52.332
Yeah!

544
00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:54.832
Well?

545
00:38:56.916 --> 00:38:58.332
Well, what do you wanna know?

546
00:38:58.332 --> 00:38:59.332
Why'd Tommy ask her to the prom?

547
00:39:03.332 --> 00:39:05.332
- Well?
- I asked him to.

548
00:39:07.332 --> 00:39:08.332
Why?

549
00:39:09.332 --> 00:39:11.332
What for?

550
00:39:12.832 --> 00:39:14.332
What could you possibly
have had in mind?

551
00:39:14.499 --> 00:39:17.332
I thought it would be
a good thing for Carrie,

552
00:39:17.332 --> 00:39:21.332
to get her to join in with
a few things and be with people...

553
00:39:21.332 --> 00:39:23.707
- Make her a part of things?
- Right.

554
00:39:24.332 --> 00:39:25.332
Come on, Sue.

555
00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:28.332
We're not that stupid.

556
00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:32.332
- Neither is Carrie.
- Maybe not... I don't know.

557
00:39:33.332 --> 00:39:34.874
You mean you're not gonna go?

558
00:39:34.916 --> 00:39:37.332
You're just gonna stay home
and miss your own senior prom?

559
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:40.332
Come in.

560
00:39:41.166 --> 00:39:44.332
- What is it?
- Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

561
00:39:44.332 --> 00:39:46.332
Thank you. You know you
can't go without a date.

562
00:39:51.332 --> 00:39:52.332
Is there anything else, Norma?

563
00:39:52.332 --> 00:39:54.332
- No, Miss Collins.
- Thank you, Norma.

564
00:40:00.332 --> 00:40:01.332
Which brings us to you.

565
00:40:01.874 --> 00:40:04.707
- Miss Collins, I have to get to practice.
- Well, that's too bad, isn't it?

566
00:40:05.332 --> 00:40:09.332
- If you don't mind, it's between Sue and I.
- But I do mind... unless, of course,

567
00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:12.332
you'd like to continue this little
discussion in Mr. Morton's office.

568
00:40:14.332 --> 00:40:16.332
What is the big deal?!

569
00:40:16.332 --> 00:40:20.332
Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.

570
00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:22.582
Well, she already
said no, anyway.

571
00:40:22.582 --> 00:40:26.332
- Yeah, well, with a little effort you can change that.
- Don't count your chickens.

572
00:40:26.332 --> 00:40:29.332
- Just don't try...
- Fine. I won't try.

573
00:40:29.332 --> 00:40:32.332
Wait a second! It's not fine!

574
00:40:33.332 --> 00:40:36.332
You can't order someone
not to take someone to the prom!

575
00:40:36.332 --> 00:40:39.999
You know, I can make sure
you don't hurt Carrie White anymore.

576
00:40:40.332 --> 00:40:43.332
We're not trying to hurt her, Miss Collins.
We're trying to help her!

577
00:40:43.332 --> 00:40:44.332
How?!

578
00:40:51.707 --> 00:40:56.332
Hey, Tommy, um... Don't you think
you're just gonna look a little ridiculous

579
00:40:56.332 --> 00:40:58.541
when you walk in the prom
with Carrie White?

580
00:40:58.832 --> 00:41:00.416
We don't care how we look.

581
00:41:02.332 --> 00:41:04.124
Do we?

582
00:41:10.041 --> 00:41:11.499
What?

583
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:13.041
I...

584
00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:10.041
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi.

585
00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:12.874
So this is where you live, huh?

586
00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:16.082
- What are you doing here?
- You gonna ask me in?

587
00:42:17.791 --> 00:42:18.791
Why not?

588
00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:24.041
Mama's resting.

589
00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:29.124
- What do you want?
- God, right to the point. Um...

590
00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:32.041
- About the prom, again...
- I already told you.

591
00:42:32.332 --> 00:42:35.041
Well, I know, but there's nothing to say
you can't change your mind.

592
00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:37.041
- Girls do it all the time.
- Why are you doing this?

593
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:39.041
- 'Cause I want to.
- No, you're not.

594
00:42:39.041 --> 00:42:41.041
Carrie, now, come on.
I don't do anything I don't want.

595
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:43.374
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

596
00:42:43.374 --> 00:42:44.374
Carrie!

597
00:42:45.624 --> 00:42:48.041
- You'd better go.
- Not till you say yes.

598
00:42:48.041 --> 00:42:50.582
- No. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

599
00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:52.582
I said I can't.

600
00:42:52.749 --> 00:42:53.749
Carrie!

601
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.041
Yes, you can.

602
00:42:57.041 --> 00:43:00.041
- Will you please go?
- Not till you say yes.

603
00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:02.457
Why is this so important to you?

604
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:08.041
I don't know. Maybe because, um...
you liked my poem.

605
00:43:08.749 --> 00:43:10.041
Carrie!

606
00:43:13.332 --> 00:43:18.041
- Okay, okay, I'll go.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.

607
00:43:19.332 --> 00:43:20.541
Okay.

608
00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:26.541
What's the matter, Willie?

609
00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:29.916
We gonna wake up the
little piggies? Oink, oink!

610
00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:33.707
You know, this is a hell of a
risk for a joke, uh, Bill.

611
00:43:33.874 --> 00:43:38.582
- You want out?
- No, no. It's a good joke. It's a good joke.

612
00:43:39.041 --> 00:43:41.041
Look at this!

613
00:43:41.457 --> 00:43:43.749
- What?
- All these pigs!

614
00:43:44.041 --> 00:43:45.041
What are you talking about?

615
00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:47.041
These painted pigs!

616
00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:50.832
Stupid old man Hanky's nitwit cousin
painted them.

617
00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:52.041
Shh!

618
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:56.041
<i>Bo 21 I went out with the girl that posed
for 'em. She was a real pig!</i>

619
00:43:56.041 --> 00:43:59.041
- Will you shut up?!
- Will you let me up there?

620
00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:01.041
You're gonna
kill that pig, right?

621
00:44:03.499 --> 00:44:05.541
Piggy!
Ha-ha!

622
00:44:05.874 --> 00:44:07.041
Here, piggy!

623
00:44:07.499 --> 00:44:10.041
I'm gonna bash
your little heads in,

624
00:44:10.207 --> 00:44:14.041
and you don't have to worry
about the bomb no more.

625
00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:18.041
Come here, little piggies!
Come here, you little sucker!

626
00:44:18.082 --> 00:44:20.041
Here's one right here.

627
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:23.041
- Will you shut up and do it, already?
- We gotta give it a chance to burn!

628
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:25.041
- Oh, yeah?
- Come here, you little sucker. Come here, piggy!

629
00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:29.041
You can't do it standin' out here.
Get 'er done, man, get 'er done.

630
00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:33.041
- I can't. I can't. You.
- Oh, I knew this would happen!

631
00:44:33.041 --> 00:44:37.041
- Just... hold it there, you pig. You fuck-up!
- Do it, Billy!

632
00:44:37.332 --> 00:44:39.166
- And you shut up!
- Just do it!

633
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:45.041
All right, move it out, move it out!
That's it! That's it! Come on! Move it out!

634
00:44:46.041 --> 00:44:48.041
Yeah, that's my baby!
Yeah! Yeah!

635
00:44:48.332 --> 00:44:50.041
Do it! Do it!

636
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:51.041
Do it!

637
00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:07.791
Carrie, you haven't touched
your apple cake.

638
00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:10.041
Gives me pimples, Mama.

639
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.041
Pimples are the Lord's way
of chastising you.

640
00:45:15.041 --> 00:45:17.041
- Mama?
- Yeah?

641
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:21.041
Mama, please see that I've gotta start to
try and get along with people better.

642
00:45:21.666 --> 00:45:24.041
What are you going on
about, Carrie?

643
00:45:25.041 --> 00:45:27.041
I've been invited to the prom.

644
00:45:29.207 --> 00:45:30.207
The prom?

645
00:45:31.874 --> 00:45:35.041
Yeah, the senior prom,
you know. Everybody's goin'.

646
00:45:35.749 --> 00:45:38.041
It's that teacher that called...
wasn't it?

647
00:45:38.582 --> 00:45:41.041
Please see that
I'm not like you, Mama.

648
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:44.041
I'm funny. I mean,
all the kids think I'm funny.

649
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:45.249
I don't wanna be.
I wanna be normal.

650
00:45:45.374 --> 00:45:49.582
I wanna start to try and be a whole person
before it's too late for me to...

651
00:45:52.457 --> 00:45:54.041
His name is Tommy Ross.

652
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:56.041
- He's a very nice boy, Mama.
- No.

653
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:59.041
- He promised to stop in and meet you.
- I said no.

654
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:02.041
- Mama, I've accepted. I've accepted.
- I said no. No, no, no!

655
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:03.166
I've accepted!

656
00:46:03.832 --> 00:46:06.041
- Come to your closet.
- No.

657
00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:09.166
- After all you've been taught...
- Everyone isn't bad, Mama!

658
00:46:09.374 --> 00:46:11.041
Everything isn't a sin!

659
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:14.041
Come to your closet and pray.
Ask to be forgiven.

660
00:46:14.874 --> 00:46:18.749
He's a nice boy, Mama. You'll like him.
You'll really like him, Mama.

661
00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:20.749
Boys.

662
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:26.582
The boys! The boys!
Yes, the boys...

663
00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:30.041
After the blood
come the boys...

664
00:46:30.041 --> 00:46:32.041
- Mama...
- Like sniffing dogs,

665
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:36.041
grinning and slobbering and trying
to find out where that smell comes from.

666
00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:38.041
Where the smell is.
That smell.

667
00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:42.041
Listen, I know where they take them
in their cars, I've seen it all!

668
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:45.041
- Well, you're not going.
- Already said I would.

669
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:49.041
Tell that boy you're not going,
or we're gonna move from here!

670
00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:50.041
No.

671
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:53.041
We'll move from here
and never see that boy again!

672
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:57.207
- Mama, please say that Tommy and me...
- The rain's coming in. I'm gonna close the window.

673
00:46:57.916 --> 00:47:00.041
Mama, please sit and talk to me!

674
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:12.041
I'm goin', Mama.

675
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:15.874
And things are gonna change
around here.

676
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:19.041
Witch.

677
00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:22.499
Got Satan's power.

678
00:47:23.541 --> 00:47:25.666
It's nothin' to do
with Satan, Mama.

679
00:47:25.666 --> 00:47:28.041
It's me. Me.

680
00:47:28.041 --> 00:47:31.291
If I concentrate hard enough,
I can move things.

681
00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:34.207
- Satan is clever.
- No, Mama.

682
00:47:35.374 --> 00:47:37.374
I'm not the only one.

683
00:47:38.082 --> 00:47:40.707
Other people can do it.
I read about it.

684
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:44.041
You poor child. Don't you know?

685
00:47:44.749 --> 00:47:47.041
He doesn't let you know
he's working through you.

686
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:50.041
Mama... I know.

687
00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:52.041
He entered your father
and carried him off!

688
00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:57.041
- He ran away, Mama.
- The devil tempted him!

689
00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.416
He ran away with a woman, Mama.

690
00:47:59.916 --> 00:48:02.041
Everybody knows that.

691
00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:06.041
You must renounce this power.
You must give it up. You must never use it.

692
00:48:08.499 --> 00:48:10.041
I'm goin', Mama.

693
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:14.041
You can't stop me.

694
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:16.499
And I don't wanna
talk about it any more.

695
00:48:33.499 --> 00:48:37.041
- You keep that damn light straight.
- Hurry up!

696
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:40.624
Watch it, you stupid shit!
You're getting blood all over the place!

697
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:45.041
Who you calling a stupid shit?

698
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.707
I mean, you can't even keep
that fuckin' light straight.

699
00:48:47.707 --> 00:48:49.041
Just hurry up.

700
00:48:50.041 --> 00:48:54.541
Yes, ma'am! We's doin' the bes' we can!
We really are, boss!

701
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:57.041
Hurry up. I wanna go home.

702
00:49:01.707 --> 00:49:04.249
Just... keep your tits on.

703
00:49:04.707 --> 00:49:07.707
And I'll let you pull the rope
when the time comes.

704
00:49:08.707 --> 00:49:09.707
I plan to.

705
00:49:10.249 --> 00:49:11.707
I know.

706
00:49:30.707 --> 00:49:34.166
Ernest, listen tonight's prom night
and everything, right?

707
00:49:34.707 --> 00:49:38.707
- I didn't know you were interested in going.
- What do you mean? I'm a student here, ain't 1?

708
00:49:38.874 --> 00:49:42.707
- I don't know. Are you?
- Sure I am. I got so much spirit in this school,

709
00:49:42.707 --> 00:49:44.041
I wanna be on the committee.

710
00:49:44.207 --> 00:49:47.707
You're a little late, Freddy. I could've used you
a week ago on the decorating committee.

711
00:49:48.082 --> 00:49:52.707
No, I'm not late, Ernest. I'm right on time, pal.
You know, I wanna collect the ballots. You know,

712
00:49:52.707 --> 00:49:55.916
for the king and queen and the voting,
and the, you know?

713
00:49:56.624 --> 00:50:00.707
- Think we could arrange that?
- Okay. Can you be here at 6:307

714
00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:02.957
No. No, I can't be here at 6:30.

715
00:50:03.666 --> 00:50:05.707
I'll be here at 8. How's 8?

716
00:50:05.707 --> 00:50:08.707
- Yeah, that'll do. Okay.
- 8's fine with me. Okay, well, we'll see you then.

717
00:50:08.707 --> 00:50:12.249
- Yeah, see you Freddy. Take it easy.
- I'll take it any way I can get it, pal.

718
00:50:12.249 --> 00:50:13.707
Hey, Helen.

719
00:50:13.999 --> 00:50:15.707
Helen!

720
00:50:15.707 --> 00:50:16.541
Helen!

721
00:50:16.707 --> 00:50:18.707
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

722
00:50:19.207 --> 00:50:22.291
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

723
00:50:22.457 --> 00:50:25.707
- What?
- He's taking Carrie White to the prom.

724
00:50:25.707 --> 00:50:27.707
- No!
- Yeah!

725
00:50:29.707 --> 00:50:32.499
When did that happen? He can't do that!

726
00:50:32.499 --> 00:50:34.082
- Where's Sue?
- Yes, he can. He asked her.

727
00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:36.707
- What's she gonna wear?
- Who, Carrie?

728
00:50:36.707 --> 00:50:39.707
A sackcloth?!

729
00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:43.707
- Sweetie, keep those stars coming faster.
- They're coming.

730
00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:47.707
What's this I hear about Tommy
taking Carrie to the prom?

731
00:50:47.707 --> 00:50:49.707
Whatever you heard,
it's true.

732
00:50:50.999 --> 00:50:53.999
Why is he doing it?
Everybody is talking about it.

733
00:50:54.707 --> 00:50:57.707
I asked him to
cause I thought I owed it to Carrie.

734
00:50:57.707 --> 00:51:01.041
- Where's that put everybody else?
- They gotta deal with it in their own way.

735
00:51:01.207 --> 00:51:03.707
- What do you mean?
- Oh... just something.

736
00:51:03.707 --> 00:51:07.707
- Well, you're not going to the prom.
- Oh, I'll be here.

737
00:51:07.707 --> 00:51:09.166
- You'll be here?
- I sure will.

738
00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.707
What do you mean, you're going to the prom?

739
00:51:10.707 --> 00:51:13.707
Shut up. I will tell you later.
You're gonna be in on it, don't worry about a thing.

740
00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:15.916
I'm gonna be in on it? What?

741
00:51:15.916 --> 00:51:17.707
I'll tell you later!

742
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:22.624
- I want to know now, Chris. You can't give me a hint?
- Just wait.

743
00:51:22.707 --> 00:51:28.707
I won't tell anybody, I promise. I won't say
a word. I promise, I'm your best friend. Come on.

744
00:51:28.707 --> 00:51:29.707
Okay.

745
00:52:03.707 --> 00:52:08.707
- You gotta rent yourself a tuxedo for the prom.
- I know, I only got 10 bucks, though.

746
00:52:08.707 --> 00:52:10.707
You can rent yourself a tuxedo!
You don't have to look great!

747
00:52:10.707 --> 00:52:11.707
Hey.

748
00:52:12.707 --> 00:52:14.332
Does this look nice?

749
00:52:14.332 --> 00:52:17.707
He looks beautiful. You can look good.
Make a good impression for once in your life.

750
00:52:17.707 --> 00:52:19.707
- Would you go out with me?
- Not with ruffles.

751
00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:23.707
You don't have to get ruffles for yourself.
You always gotta make a joke, right?

752
00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:26.707
- I don't like ruffles...
- You don't have to get ruffles!

753
00:52:26.707 --> 00:52:28.707
Alright, now look at me, Beak.
Don't I look sharp?

754
00:52:28.707 --> 00:52:32.582
It looks good on you,
but I don't look right in a tuxedo.

755
00:52:32.707 --> 00:52:34.874
- How do you know? Have you ever put on a tuxedo?
- I don't have a tuxedo body.

756
00:52:38.707 --> 00:52:42.707
- I know they have tuxedos here for you.
- But I wouldn't look right in it.

757
00:52:42.707 --> 00:52:44.707
Wait a second.
I know just the tuxedo for him.

758
00:52:44.707 --> 00:52:49.707
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it. I think it's terrific.

759
00:52:49.707 --> 00:52:51.707
Look at that. No ruffles at all!

760
00:53:02.332 --> 00:53:05.707
Red. I might've known it would be red.

761
00:53:06.707 --> 00:53:08.541
It's pink, Mama.

762
00:53:10.582 --> 00:53:12.582
Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.

763
00:53:12.582 --> 00:53:14.457
Aren't they beautiful?

764
00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:22.582
I can see your dirty pillows.

765
00:53:23.582 --> 00:53:24.582
Everyone will.

766
00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:27.582
Breasts, Mama.

767
00:53:27.582 --> 00:53:29.582
They're called breasts.

768
00:53:29.582 --> 00:53:31.582
And every woman has them.

769
00:53:36.582 --> 00:53:38.582
Take off that dress.

770
00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:39.582
No.

771
00:53:39.582 --> 00:53:43.582
- We'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness.
- No, Mama.

772
00:53:57.332 --> 00:53:58.582
Well, he's not coming.

773
00:53:58.582 --> 00:54:01.957
He is coming, Mama.
Now stop it. I'm nervous enough.

774
00:54:07.999 --> 00:54:09.582
No, he's not coming.

775
00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:13.541
He's not gonna come.

776
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:20.874
Go away!

777
00:54:22.541 --> 00:54:23.707
Stop it, Mama!

778
00:54:24.416 --> 00:54:26.582
- Stop hurting yourself, Mama!
- I'm not!

779
00:54:27.582 --> 00:54:30.957
He's gonna laugh at you!
They're all gonna laugh at you!

780
00:54:31.124 --> 00:54:34.166
- They're not gonna laugh at me!
- It's not too late. You can stay here with me.

781
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:36.082
I don't wanna stay with you, Mama!

782
00:54:36.207 --> 00:54:38.582
Look, I'll answer the door.
I'll tell him you're sick!

783
00:54:38.957 --> 00:54:41.082
- I'll tell him you changed your mind!
- Be quiet.

784
00:54:41.082 --> 00:54:43.582
Sit down! Be quiet!

785
00:54:55.582 --> 00:54:57.166
Carrie, look. I'll tell him
you changed your mind!

786
00:54:57.166 --> 00:54:59.041
Sit down!

787
00:55:00.582 --> 00:55:05.582
Just sit there, Mama,
and don't say a word until I'm gone.

788
00:55:07.582 --> 00:55:09.582
I'll be home early.

789
00:55:12.582 --> 00:55:14.582
I love you, Mama.

790
00:55:17.582 --> 00:55:19.749
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

791
00:55:45.582 --> 00:55:47.582
Tommy,

792
00:55:48.582 --> 00:55:50.582
could we wait here
just a minute?

793
00:56:00.291 --> 00:56:01.291
Are you scared?

794
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.291
Mm-hmm.

795
00:56:09.041 --> 00:56:10.291
Maybe this was a mistake.

796
00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:14.291
Oh, no.
It's not gonna be that bad.

797
00:56:15.707 --> 00:56:17.707
They're a good crowd. Really.

798
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:20.707
Really.

799
00:56:21.291 --> 00:56:23.291
Don't be so nervous.

800
00:56:24.291 --> 00:56:27.749
Besides, I'd look awfully stupid
dancing by myself, wouldn't 1?

801
00:56:28.291 --> 00:56:29.291
Now come on.

Ross, if I knew you'd look this sharp,
I would've taken you instead of, uh...

838
00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:01.291
What's her name?

839
00:58:01.291 --> 00:58:04.041
Don't bother about them.
If they self-destruct,

840
00:58:04.041 --> 00:58:05.291
I'll dance with you.

841
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:11.291
Hey, where did you buy that dress?
I love it!

842
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:13.874
- Oh, I made it.
- Made it?!

843
00:58:14.832 --> 00:58:17.291
The decorations...
don't they look great?

844
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:18.291
Yeah...

845
00:58:18.291 --> 00:58:22.291
- I'm so nervous.
- It's okay. You can sit with us.

846
00:58:22.707 --> 00:58:25.291
- Hey, what time is it?
- 8 o'clock.

847
00:58:25.707 --> 00:58:26.916
Gotta go.

848
00:58:26.916 --> 00:58:28.291
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

849
00:58:30.291 --> 00:58:31.291
See you later.

850
00:58:31.291 --> 00:58:32.291
Sue!

851
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:48.707
- Would you like to dance?
- Could we just sit here for a minute?

852
00:58:48.916 --> 00:58:49.957
Oh, sure.

853
00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:52.291
Sure. Anything you want.

854
00:58:58.749 --> 00:58:59.832
Carrie.

855
00:59:00.374 --> 00:59:02.291
Hi, Miss Collins.

856
00:59:02.541 --> 00:59:04.291
You look so pretty!

857
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:06.291
You, too. You look beautiful.

858
00:59:07.291 --> 00:59:11.291
Thank you! |I know I don't, not really,
but thank you, anyway.

859
00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:12.416
May I sit down?

860
00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.291
- Yeah. Chair...
- Thank you.

861
00:59:17.291 --> 00:59:19.291
I'm gonna go
and talk to some people.

<i>♪ Born to want too much</i>

864
00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:42.874
I remember my prom.
I had a date with the, uh...

865
00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:45.291
...the captain
of the basketball team.

866
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:49.291
And he was 6 feet,
7 inches tall, so

867
00:59:49.291 --> 00:59:54.916
I bought a pair of 3-inch spike heels
so that our kiss goodnight would be, um...

868
00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:59.291
...less awkward.
Anyway, we went in his pick-up truck,

869
00:59:59.291 --> 01:00:04.291
which of course broke down, and we
had to walk the last half-mile to the prom.

870
01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:08.291
By the time I got there, my feet were
so blistered that all I could do was

871
01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:14.291
just sit there. I couldn't dance.
So we just sat there and, uh... just talked.

872
01:00:14.999 --> 01:00:16.291
And, uh,

873
01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:20.291
it was... magic. Is it like that for you?

874
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:22.332
It's, um...

875
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:26.291
it's nice.

876
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:29.291
- Just nice?
- No...! It's...

877
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.291
It's like, uh...

878
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:37.291
- It's like being on Mars.
- You'll never forget it.

879
01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:40.291
I don't think I will.

880
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:43.291
Thank you.

881
01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:45.457
Hey, what's goin' on here?

882
01:00:47.291 --> 01:00:49.291
What are you doing with my date?

883
01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:51.291
- Oh, we're just talking, you know.
- Yeah?

884
01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:54.291
Have a lovely time, okay?

885
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:55.499
And you, too!

886
01:00:57.291 --> 01:00:58.666
Bye.

887
01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.291
Don't let me catch you
hugging any guys like that.

888
01:01:04.874 --> 01:01:06.291
I won't.

889
01:01:06.874 --> 01:01:08.291
Better not.

890
01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:09.291
I won't.

891
01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:19.291
Do you really have to be
home so early?

892
01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:23.291
Yeah, I promised.

893
01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:24.291
Okay.

894
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:29.291
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

895
01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:34.457
Some of the kids are going
over to Nolston's after the prom.

896
01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:36.291
That's okay.

897
01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:38.291
What?

898
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:41.291
If you wanna go with your friends,
I don't wanna spoil anything.

899
01:01:41.332 --> 01:01:43.291
Would you just let me finish?

900
01:01:43.291 --> 01:01:47.291
What I was gonna say is that,
if you'd like to,

901
01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:50.291
we could stop in at The Beehive
for a couple minutes.

902
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.291
- I've never been there.
- No?

903
01:01:53.291 --> 01:01:56.291
Good! Well, then, let's go!

904
01:01:56.291 --> 01:01:57.582
- Okay.
- Okay?

905
01:01:58.249 --> 01:02:00.291
For sure. Great.

906
01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:05.291
Are you ready to dance?

907
01:02:07.416 --> 01:02:08.416
Tommy, ...

908
01:02:08.582 --> 01:02:09.749
Come on.

909
01:02:09.749 --> 01:02:12.957
I don't know how.
I can't, Tommy. I can't.

910
01:02:12.957 --> 01:02:14.291
Sure you can.

anyone else out here.

- Yeah, you can.

935
01:03:36.291 --> 01:03:40.041
I can't dance. I can't even...
I don't know.

936
01:04:03.291 --> 01:04:05.291
- Tommy?
- Yeah?

937
01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:07.291
Why...

938
01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:10.957
- Why what?
- Why am I here?

939
01:04:12.624 --> 01:04:14.291
Because it's the prom.

940
01:04:14.832 --> 01:04:16.291
Why am I here with you?

941
01:04:19.124 --> 01:04:21.832
Because I asked you.

942
01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:24.707
Why'd you ask me?

943
01:04:25.041 --> 01:04:26.499
Because I wanted to.

944
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:30.291
Why'd you want to?

945
01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:33.291
Because you liked my poem.

946
01:04:35.082 --> 01:04:37.082
Only, I didn't write it.
Somebody else did.

947
01:04:38.624 --> 01:04:39.624
Oh.

948
01:04:40.791 --> 01:04:43.082
Carrie, we're here

949
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:45.791
and we're together

950
01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:47.791
and I like it.

951
01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:50.791

All right, ladies and gentlemen!

957
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:35.791
Ladies and gentlemen...

958
01:05:35.791 --> 01:05:38.791
And you two
behave yourselves, okay?

959
01:05:40.791 --> 01:05:44.791
Take your seats, please. We've gotta vote
for the king and the queen.

960
01:05:53.541 --> 01:05:54.791
Tommy,

961
01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:56.207
we're on here.

962
01:05:56.374 --> 01:05:57.791
I know.

963
01:05:59.457 --> 01:06:00.791
Do you wanna decline?

964
01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:03.749
Do you?

965
01:06:04.916 --> 01:06:09.791
Hell, no. If you win, all they do is put you
up there for a school song and a dance.

966
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:11.791
And then some guy takes
your picture for the yearbook,

967
01:06:12.082 --> 01:06:14.791
SO everyone can see
we look like a couple of idiots.

968
01:06:16.791 --> 01:06:18.791
Anyway, it's the last year.
Why not?

969
01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:20.791
It's so beautiful!

970
01:06:24.957 --> 01:06:26.207
Hey...

971
01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:28.332
You're beautiful.

972
01:06:34.999 --> 01:06:39.791
Well, who should we vote for?
They're more your crowd than mine.

973
01:06:40.791 --> 01:06:41.791
I don't even have a crowd.

974
01:06:44.124 --> 01:06:45.791
Let's vote for ourselves.

975
01:06:47.416 --> 01:06:48.416
No.

976
01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:49.791
Why not?

977
01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:52.791
Please don't vote for ourselves.

978
01:06:55.791 --> 01:06:56.916
Carrie...

979
01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:08.957
Come on.
To the devil with false modesty.

980
01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:12.291
The devil!

981
01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:49.416
Billy! Shut up!

982
01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:51.416
Will you close that
a little bit?

983
01:07:51.957 --> 01:07:54.124
Jesus, you wanna get caught?

984
01:07:54.416 --> 01:07:57.624
- That Carrie White, she sure is cute.
- Shut up.

985
01:07:59.416 --> 01:08:04.416
- Thought you said they were gonna win.
- They will. Won't even be close.

986
01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:06.416
I called in a few favors.

987
01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:08.416
] Can I have your ballot, please?

988
01:08:14.374 --> 01:08:16.416

Help! Help!

1029
01:18:21.749 --> 01:18:23.249
Look at him!

1030
01:18:48.082 --> 01:18:49.416
Have these students calm down!

1031
01:18:52.082 --> 01:18:53.249

Mama?

1036
01:26:03.207 --> 01:26:06.999
Mama? Mama, it was bad, Mama.

1037
01:26:06.999 --> 01:26:08.999
They laughed at me.

1038
01:26:08.999 --> 01:26:11.999
Mama, hold me.

1039
01:26:11.999 --> 01:26:14.999

Please, hold me!

1042
01:26:29.374 --> 01:26:32.374
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

1043
01:26:34.082 --> 01:26:36.374
After the first time,
before we were married.

1044
01:26:36.916 --> 01:26:38.416
Ralph promised never again.

1045
01:26:41.374 --> 01:26:44.374
He promised, and I believed him.

1046
01:26:47.374 --> 01:26:49.374
But sin never dies.

1047
01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:53.374
Sin never dies.

1048
01:26:54.624 --> 01:26:56.457
At first it was all right.

1049
01:26:57.166 --> 01:26:58.374
We lived sinlessly.

1050
01:26:59.374 --> 01:27:02.374
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

1051
01:27:04.374 --> 01:27:08.374
And then, that night,

1052
01:27:10.374 --> 01:27:13.374
I saw him looking down
at me that way.

1053
01:27:17.374 --> 01:27:20.582
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

1054
01:27:22.582 --> 01:27:25.374
I smelled the whisky
on his breath.

1055
01:27:27.582 --> 01:27:31.374
And he took me... he took me.

1056
01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:38.374
With the stink of the filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

1057
01:27:38.374 --> 01:27:40.374
And I liked it.

1058
01:27:41.374 --> 01:27:42.374
I liked it!

1059
01:27:45.374 --> 01:27:49.374
Well, all that dirty touching
of his hands all over me...

1060
01:27:50.374 --> 01:27:53.374
I should have given you to God
when you were born.

1061
01:27:54.374 --> 01:27:57.374
But I was weak and backsliding.

1062
01:28:01.374 --> 01:28:04.374
But now the devil has come home.

1063
01:28:05.374 --> 01:28:06.374
Oh!

1064
01:28:09.374 --> 01:28:10.374
We'll pray.

1065
01:28:10.374 --> 01:28:11.416
Yes.

1066
01:28:12.374 --> 01:28:14.124
We'll pray.

1067
01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:16.957
We'll pray.

1068
01:28:18.374 --> 01:28:19.374
We'll pray.

1069
01:28:20.374 --> 01:28:21.457
For the last time,

1070
01:28:22.374 --> 01:28:23.832
we'll pray.

1071
01:28:29.374 --> 01:28:33.374
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1072
01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:36.374
Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done...

1073
01:29:27.374 --> 01:29:28.374
Aghh!

1074
01:29:30.374 --> 01:29:31.374
Aah!

1075
01:29:34.374 --> 01:29:35.374
Ohh!

1076
01:29:36.707 --> 01:29:37.374
Aghh!

1077
01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:39.374
Aaghhh...!

1078
01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.374
Aaghh!

1079
01:29:42.374 --> 01:29:45.374
Aaaah!

1080
01:33:57.707 --> 01:33:58.707
Hello?

1081
01:33:59.749 --> 01:34:01.916
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.

1082
01:34:01.916 --> 01:34:04.916
I don't think I could have
handled one more reporter.

1083
01:34:06.916 --> 01:34:10.916
Yeah, well,
we're all a little edgy.

1084
01:34:12.916 --> 01:34:16.916
She's better. Well, uh,
sleeping too much, I guess,

1085
01:34:16.916 --> 01:34:21.457
but Dr. Schnieder said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

1086
01:34:23.499 --> 01:34:28.916
Well, he said that she's young enough,
so that she'll forget all about it in time.

1087
01:34:28.916 --> 01:34:34.916
No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals,
with Tommy and all the others gone.

1088
01:34:34.916 --> 01:34:37.374
It's best we just
go away for a while.

1089
01:36:10.416 --> 01:36:11.916
It's all right!

1090
01:36:17.916 --> 01:36:22.624
It's all right. I'm here.
It's all right.

1091
01:36:23.916 --> 01:36:25.666
It's all right. I'm here.

1092
01:36:25.916 --> 01:36:27.499
It's all right.
