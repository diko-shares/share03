[girl] Hit it to Carrie!
She'll blow it!

9
00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:47.082
[girl 2] Don't blow it, Carrie! Hit it!

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:48.582
[whistle blowing]

11
00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:51.582
- [girl 2] Carrie...!
- [girl 3] She blew it again!

12
00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:53.582
[girl 4] We almost had the game!

13
00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:56.582
[girl 5] We can't win a game
with her on the team.

14
00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:58.832
Look at her!
Just standing there!

15
00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:01.416
You eat shit!

- Carrie.

49
00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:32.582

Stop it! Now relax! Calm down.
Listen to me. Listen.

56
00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:49.582
I it's okay. It's okay.
Now you're just going to

57
00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.874
stand up and take care
of yourself. Now, come on. Come on.

58
00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:53.916
Grow up. Stand up and take care
of yourself.

59
00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:55.582
Come on, do it. Do it.

60
00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:56.582

00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:57.582
[suspenseful music]
[glass breaking]

62
00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:00.582
Did you see that?

63
00:06:00.582 --> 00:06:02.582
No...!

64
00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.916
[girls laughing]

65
00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:06.916
Get out of here.
Go on. Right now. Move!

66
00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.166
Carrie...

67
00:06:16.582 --> 00:06:21.582
Carrie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know, okay? I'm sorry.

68
00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:24.207
Baby, come on, now.
Don't you know?

69
00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:26.041
Listen. Listen.

70
00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.582
I'm gonna talk to you about it, now, okay?
Now just calm down. Just relax.

71
00:06:30.582 --> 00:06:33.582
See? They're all gone. They're all gone.

72
00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.582
Now, listen.
It's gonna be okay.

73
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:44.582
[voices murmuring]

74
00:06:47.624 --> 00:06:49.874
[soft music playing]

75
00:06:50.374 --> 00:06:54.582
- Isn't she a bit old for her, uh...
- Her first period.

76
00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:56.582
Um... yes.

77
00:06:58.582 --> 00:07:03.291
Morty, until a half-hour ago, I don't even
think she knew there was such a thing.

78
00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:09.124
It's really... hard to believe
in this day and age

79
00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:10.749
a girl in high school
wouldn't know something.

80
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.957
Uh, facts...

81
00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:14.624
Well, she didn't.

82
00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:18.582
But I don't know why that should surprise us,
I mean, knowing that mother of hers.

83
00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:23.166
- We can't interfere with people's beliefs.
- I know, I know.

84
00:07:23.624 --> 00:07:26.582
- As for the girls...
- Carrie's always been their scapegoat.

85
00:07:26.582 --> 00:07:28.374
- You've got to do something.
- I will.

86
00:07:30.207 --> 00:07:33.291
But see, the thing is, Morty, that, um...

87
00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:35.082
I knew how they felt.

88
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:39.041
See, the whole thing just made me
wanna take her and shake her, too.

89
00:07:39.832 --> 00:07:41.166
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:45.499
- It was just her period, for God's sake!
- Well, we'll send her home.

91
00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:48.707
Miss Finch,
will you send in Cassie Wright?

92
00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:49.916
It's Carrie White.

93
00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:56.916
Come in, Cassie.

94
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:58.291
Carrie.

95
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:01.874
Miss Finch, would you
bring in a dismissal slip?

96
00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.916
I thought you might take
the rest of the day

97
00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:08.916
and go home,
take care of yourself, Cassie.

98
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:12.916
[dramatic music]

99
00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:16.332
We're all very sorry
about this incident.

100
00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:18.499
[dramatic music continues]

101
00:08:23.207 --> 00:08:24.207
It's Carrie.

102
00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:28.999
[principal] Thank you.

103
00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:34.916
Would you like
to go to the infirmary?

104
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:38.291
- Lie down for a while?
- I think Carrie can go home.

105
00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:46.916
Would you like a ride?
We could call you a cab.

106
00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:48.916
I'm sure she can walk home.

107
00:08:49.582 --> 00:08:53.916
And, Carrie, you're dismissed from gym
for a week. Just take study hall instead, okay?

108
00:08:56.499 --> 00:08:58.916
We're all sorry
about this incident, Cassie.

109
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:00.041
It's Carrie!

Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie!
Ha-ha!

[suspenseful music]

115
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:32.916
Ohh!

116
00:09:33.332 --> 00:09:35.291
Ohh! Ohh...

[woman on TV]
<i>Were you in Chicago two years ago?</i>

118
00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:53.374
[man on TV] <i>Chicago?</i>

119
00:09:54.207 --> 00:09:56.541
- [woman on TV] <i>Yes, Bill. Chicago.</i>
- [doorbell rings]

120
00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.916
[man on TV]
<i>Why, yes, I was living in Chicago.</i>

121
00:09:59.957 --> 00:10:01.916
<i>You knew that, didn't you?
I told you that, didn't I</i>

122
00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:03.916
[woman on TV] <i>No, you didn't.
I found out.</i>

123
00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:06.916
[man on TV]
<i>You're looking at me so, uh, strangely...</i>

124
00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:09.416
Oh, Mrs. White.

125
00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:11.916
- How have you been, Mrs. Snell?
- Fine.

126
00:10:12.249 --> 00:10:14.582
- And the doctor?
- Fine.

127
00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:18.374
- And your daughter?
- Sue is fine.

128
00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:23.582
- Won't you come in, Mrs. White?
- Oh, how kind of you.

129
00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:31.916
- I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
- Yes.

130
00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:37.291
- Perhaps sometime she might like to visit.
- I'm here on the Lord's work, Mrs. Snell.

131
00:10:37.916 --> 00:10:41.916
Spread in" the gospel of God's salvation
through Christ's blood.

132
00:10:42.582 --> 00:10:43.499
Yes, of course.

133
00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:47.249
I have something here I know is gonna
interest the doctor and you.

134
00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:51.791
The teenager's path to salvation
through the cross of Jesus.

135
00:10:51.916 --> 00:10:53.916
I don't think Sue
would be very interested.

136
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:58.249
The children are wandering through the
wilderness of sin these days, Mrs. Snell.

137
00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:00.582
My Sue is a good girl.

138
00:11:00.874 --> 00:11:02.749
These are godless times,
Mrs. Snell.

139
00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:04.499
I'll drink to that!

140
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.416
We'll... all read these.

[telephone ringing]

142
00:11:08.749 --> 00:11:10.916
Excuse me.
Please sit down, Mrs. White.

143

[telephone ringing]

144
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:14.707
Hello?

145
00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:19.124
Betty, can I call you back?
Margaret White is here.

146
00:11:20.582 --> 00:11:21.916
[man on TV] Are you accusing me...

147
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:22.916
White.

148
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.916
Just let me get rid of her
and I'll call you back.

149
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.916
[woman on TV]
And now... I'm going to kill you!

150
00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:36.624
I have something here, Mrs. Snell,
that I think you might profit from.

151
00:11:36.916 --> 00:11:41.124
- Look, Mrs. White, I'd like to contribute 5...
- Exodus.

152
00:11:41.832 --> 00:11:42.957
$10.

153
00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:46.832
I see.

154
00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:04.916
I pray you find Jesus.

155
00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:11.916
[door closes]

156
00:12:12.124 --> 00:12:15.916
- Wasn't that Carrie White's mother?
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

157
00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:17.666
What did she want?

158
00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:20.207

Yes?

[dramatic music playing]

165
00:13:23.916 --> 00:13:24.916
Thank you.

166
00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:33.249
I know you're listening.

167
00:13:34.332 --> 00:13:35.624
Come on downstairs.

168

[dramatic music continues]

169
00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:54.832
Mama?

170
00:13:55.499 --> 00:13:57.916
Who was that? Who called?

171
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:03.916
[dramatic music continues]

172
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:08.916
You're a woman now.

173
00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.916
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

174
00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:13.457
Aah!

175
00:14:16.249 --> 00:14:18.749
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam

00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.916
and Eve was weak and
loosed the raven on the world.

177
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:25.916
And the raven
was called sin. Say it.

178
00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:27.916
- The raven was called sin.
- Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

179
00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:29.916
- Say it.

180
00:14:29.916 --> 00:14:31.249
The raven was called sin.

181
00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:34.166
No, Mama...
And the raven was called sin!

182
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.041
And first sin was intercourse.

183
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.291
First sin was intercourse.

184
00:14:39.624 --> 00:14:40.791
I didn't sin, Mama.

185
00:14:40.916 --> 00:14:43.624
- Say it!
- I didn't sin, Mama!

186
00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:44.916
The first sin was intercourse.

187
00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:45.916
First sin was intercourse.

188
00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:46.916
First sin was intercourse.

189
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:48.916
And the first sin
was intercourse!

190
00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:51.374
Mama, I was so scared,
I thought I was dyin'.

191
00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:53.916
And the girls,
they all laughed at me, Mama.

192
00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:56.166
- And Eve was weak. Say it.
- No, Mama!

193
00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:57.624
- Eve was weak.
- No!

194
00:14:57.624 --> 00:14:59.249
- Eve was weak.
- No!

195
00:14:59.249 --> 00:15:01.916
- Eve was weak. Say it, woman.
- No, Mama!

196
00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:02.916
Say it!

197
00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:04.249
Eve was weak!

198
00:15:04.249 --> 00:15:05.791
Eve was weak!

199
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:08.624
And the Lord visited Eve
with a curse.

200
00:15:08.832 --> 00:15:10.957
And the curse was
the curse of blood!

201
00:15:11.249 --> 00:15:15.666
You should have told me, Mama!
You should have told me!

202
00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:16.916
O Lord!

203
00:15:17.707 --> 00:15:21.207
Help the sinning woman
see the sin of her days and ways.

204
00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:26.916
Show her that if she had remained sinless
the curse of blood would never have come on her.

205
00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:28.541
She may have been tempted
by the Antichrist.

206
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:30.916
She may have completed
the sin of lustful thoughts...

207
00:15:31.082 --> 00:15:32.207
No, Mama!

208
00:15:32.207 --> 00:15:35.374
Don't lie to me, Carrietta!
Don't you know by now I can see inside you?

209
00:15:35.374 --> 00:15:37.082
I can see the sin as surely as God can!

210
00:15:37.082 --> 00:15:39.291
- Let me go, Mama. You're hurting me.
- We'll pray!

211
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.916
- No! No!
- We'll pray, woman!

212
00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:44.749
Pray to Jesus for all the lustful,
sinning souls.

213
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:45.916
No!
[screaming]

214
00:15:45.916 --> 00:15:49.916
God visited Eve with the curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood.

215
00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:50.916
No, Mama!
[screaming]

216
00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:54.291
And he visited Eve with the second curse.
And this was the curse of childbearing.

217
00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:56.916
And Eve brought forth Cain
in sweat and blood.

218
00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.041
Genesis 3:16!

219
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.416
Mama! Let me out!

220
00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:03.666
Mama, please! Let me out!

221
00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.541
Mama, please!

222
00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:08.166
Let me out, Mama! God...!

223
00:16:08.207 --> 00:16:10.707
[dramatic music]

224
00:16:26.207 --> 00:16:28.457
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

225
00:16:28.457 --> 00:16:29.457
Thy kingdom...

226
00:16:34.916 --> 00:16:36.916
[sewing machine whirring]

227
00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:47.916
[door closes]

228
00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:55.541
Thank you, Mama.

229
00:17:01.874 --> 00:17:03.082
You can go to bed now.

230
00:17:03.374 --> 00:17:05.249
[dramatic music]

231
00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:29.416
[crying]

232
00:17:37.916 --> 00:17:38.916
[suspenseful music]

233
00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:43.916
There is power, power,
wonder-working power in the blood

234
00:17:44.082 --> 00:17:45.624
of the lamb...

235
00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:49.499
[suspenseful music]

236
00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:50.916
[glass breaking]

237
00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:54.124
Carrie?

238
00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:56.707
Carrie?

239
00:18:01.707 --> 00:18:02.707
Carrie?

240
00:18:06.707 --> 00:18:07.791
[doorknob rattling]

241
00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:09.707
Carrie?

242
00:18:09.707 --> 00:18:11.041
Carrie?

243
00:18:11.707 --> 00:18:13.041
Open the door.

244
00:18:13.707 --> 00:18:14.707
It's open, Mama.

245
00:18:15.499 --> 00:18:16.707
[door opens]

246
00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:26.707
What was that noise?

247
00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:29.707
What noise?

248
00:18:34.624 --> 00:18:35.582
Go to bed.

249
00:18:36.499 --> 00:18:38.582
Yes, ma'am. Saying my prayers...

250
00:18:42.374 --> 00:18:47.624
- [dramatic music]
- [footsteps retreating]

251
00:18:57.624 --> 00:19:02.624
[teacher] "What are you going to leave
for us, you people in your big cars,

252
00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.624
spewing pollution into the air?"

253
00:19:08.124 --> 00:19:10.624
"You people with heavy feet,

254
00:19:11.207 --> 00:19:13.624
trampling down the wilderness."

255
00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:19.624
"You people who peer into
the back seats of our cars,

256
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:24.666
hours after you come out
of the back doors of your motels."

257
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:31.166
"Soon all we will have is each other."

258
00:19:31.707 --> 00:19:33.707
"And that could be enough."

259
00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:37.624
"If you will let us have room enough

260
00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:39.582
and air enough

261
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:41.749
and peace enough

262
00:19:42.624 --> 00:19:44.291
to love each other

263
00:19:45.624 --> 00:19:47.249
as you never could."

264
00:19:49.124 --> 00:19:50.124
Hm.

265
00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:53.624
I... I really must say...
I must confess

266
00:19:53.624 --> 00:19:57.624
this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.

267
00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:05.624
Talent extraordinary for you,
Tommy Ross.

268
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:08.624
You know, Tommy,

269
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:12.874
this is slightly different from running
touchdowns and hitting home runs.

270
00:20:12.957 --> 00:20:14.707
[laughing]

271
00:20:15.624 --> 00:20:17.291
Well, class,

272
00:20:17.624 --> 00:20:19.416
any criticisms?

273
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:24.791
Anyone?

274
00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:28.624
It's beautiful.

275
00:20:29.207 --> 00:20:31.624
[laughing]

276
00:20:33.624 --> 00:20:35.416
Carrie White!

277
00:20:36.416 --> 00:20:37.416
Beautiful.

278
00:20:38.457 --> 00:20:39.457
Beautiful.

279
00:20:41.457 --> 00:20:43.457
Beautiful!

280
00:20:43.457 --> 00:20:45.374
[students laughing]

281
00:20:45.749 --> 00:20:48.457
"Oh, beautiful for
spacious skies,

282
00:20:48.457 --> 00:20:51.457
for amber waves of grain!"

283
00:20:51.457 --> 00:20:55.457
Is that the beautiful you mean?
Is it, Carrie, hmm?

284
00:20:56.457 --> 00:20:59.457
Well, I'm afraid, Carrie,
this is hardly a criticism.

285
00:20:59.999 --> 00:21:01.374
You suck.

286
00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:06.082
Tommy?
Did you say something, Tommy?

287
00:21:06.457 --> 00:21:08.916
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

288
00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:10.457
I said, "Aw, shucks."

289
00:21:10.457 --> 00:21:11.999
[students laughing]

290
00:21:20.457 --> 00:21:21.666
Roll call: Blake.

291
00:21:21.666 --> 00:21:22.457
Present.

292
00:21:22.457 --> 00:21:23.457

00:21:38.457 --> 00:21:40.249
- And the Wilsons.
- We're here.

304
00:21:40.457 --> 00:21:41.457
Okay, line up.

305
00:21:43.374 --> 00:21:44.374
Line up!

306
00:21:46.332 --> 00:21:47.332
Move it!

307
00:21:49.457 --> 00:21:52.791
On your feet right now!
Two lines!

308
00:21:55.457 --> 00:21:58.457
Alice and Mary, eyes front.

309
00:21:59.124 --> 00:22:00.457
Katie...

310
00:22:03.832 --> 00:22:04.916
You, too, Chris.

311
00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:06.457
[bubble pops]

312
00:22:06.457 --> 00:22:07.707
[teacher] And spit out that gum.

313
00:22:08.249 --> 00:22:11.457
- Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?
- You can choke on it for all I care.

314
00:22:11.457 --> 00:22:13.207
Just get it out of your mouth.

315
00:22:14.374 --> 00:22:15.541
[paper ripping]

316
00:22:25.749 --> 00:22:28.041
Wipe that smirk
off your face, Norma.

317
00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:37.457
Okay. Now I want you all to know that
you did a really shitty thing yesterday,

318
00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:39.082
a really shitty thing.

319
00:22:39.082 --> 00:22:40.457
[girls laughing]

320
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:47.457
Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?

321
00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:53.374
Do any of you
ever stop to think?

322
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:54.457
[scoffs]

323
00:22:56.707 --> 00:23:00.457
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates

324
00:23:00.457 --> 00:23:02.416
and the prom.

325
00:23:05.249 --> 00:23:09.749
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?

326
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:11.457
Billy Nolan.

327
00:23:11.457 --> 00:23:14.457
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.

328
00:23:14.457 --> 00:23:17.041
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Could you speak up?
- Billy Nolan.

329
00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:19.249
Well, isn't he the lucky one!

330
00:23:26.791 --> 00:23:28.041
What about you, Sue?

331
00:23:29.499 --> 00:23:31.457
Who's taking you?

332
00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:33.082
Tommy Ross.

333
00:23:34.457 --> 00:23:35.457
Right.

334
00:23:42.457 --> 00:23:48.457
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled
was three days' suspension

335
00:23:48.457 --> 00:23:50.582
and refusal of
your prom tickets.

336
00:23:50.832 --> 00:23:51.999
Oh!

337
00:23:52.957 --> 00:23:53.957
What...?

338
00:23:54.957 --> 00:23:56.457
God!

339
00:23:58.249 --> 00:24:00.249
That'd get you where you live,
wouldn't it?

340
00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:02.166
And you'd deserve it.

341
00:24:04.457 --> 00:24:09.749
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.

342
00:24:12.457 --> 00:24:16.957
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.

343
00:24:17.457 --> 00:24:18.457
[sighs]

344
00:24:22.457 --> 00:24:24.457
Still, there's one little catch.

345
00:24:25.457 --> 00:24:27.207
It's to be my detention.

346
00:24:28.457 --> 00:24:29.916
That's 50 minutes

347
00:24:30.457 --> 00:24:31.457
every day

348
00:24:31.457 --> 00:24:33.291
starting today

349
00:24:33.457 --> 00:24:35.457
on the athletic field.

350
00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:36.457
Get the picture?

351
00:24:36.457 --> 00:24:37.749
I'm not coming.

352
00:24:44.207 --> 00:24:45.374
That's up to you, Chris.

353
00:24:47.207 --> 00:24:49.207

[boy laughing]

708
00:44:03.499 --> 00:44:05.541
Piggy!
Ha-ha!

709
00:44:05.874 --> 00:44:07.041
Here, piggy!

710
00:44:07.499 --> 00:44:10.041
I'm gonna bash
your little heads in,

711
00:44:10.207 --> 00:44:14.041
and you don't have to worry
about the bomb no more.

712
00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:18.041
Come here, little piggies!
Come here, you little sucker!

713
00:44:18.082 --> 00:44:20.041
Here's one right here.

714
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:23.041
- [Billy] Will you shut up and do it, already?
- [boy] We gotta give it a chance to burn!

715
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:25.041
- Oh, yeah?
- Come here, you little sucker. Come here, piggy!

716
00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:29.041
You can't do it standin' out here.
Get 'er done, man, get 'er done.

717
00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:33.041
- I can't. I can't. You.
- Oh, I knew this would happen!

718
00:44:33.041 --> 00:44:37.041
- Just... hold it there, you pig. You fuck-up!
- Do it, Billy!

719
00:44:37.332 --> 00:44:39.166
- And you shut up!
- Just do it!

720
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:45.041
[Billy] All right, move it out, move it out!
That's it! That's it! Come on! Move it out!

721
00:44:45.041 --> 00:44:46.041
[pigs squealing]

722
00:44:46.041 --> 00:44:48.041
Yeah, that's my baby!
Yeah! Yeah!

723
00:44:48.332 --> 00:44:50.041
Do it! Do it!

724
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:51.041
Do it!

725
00:44:51.207 --> 00:44:53.041
[dramatic music playing]

726
00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:07.791
Carrie, you haven't touched
your apple cake.

727
00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:10.041
Gives me pimples, Mama.

728
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.041
Pimples are the Lord's way
of chastising you.

729
00:45:15.041 --> 00:45:17.041
- Mama?
- Yeah?

730
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:21.041
Mama, please see that I've gotta start to
try and get along with people better.

731
00:45:21.666 --> 00:45:24.041
What are you going on
about, Carrie?

732
00:45:25.041 --> 00:45:27.041
I've been invited to the prom.

733
00:45:29.207 --> 00:45:30.207
The prom?

734
00:45:30.499 --> 00:45:31.874
[thunder crashes]

735
00:45:31.874 --> 00:45:35.041
[Carrie] Yeah, the senior prom,
you know. Everybody's goin'.

736
00:45:35.749 --> 00:45:38.041
It's that teacher that called...
wasn't it?

737
00:45:38.582 --> 00:45:41.041
Please see that
I'm not like you, Mama.

738
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:44.041
I'm funny. I mean,
all the kids think I'm funny.

739
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:45.249
I don't wanna be.
I wanna be normal.

740
00:45:45.374 --> 00:45:49.582
I wanna start to try and be a whole person
before it's too late for me to...

741
00:45:52.457 --> 00:45:54.041
His name is Tommy Ross.

742
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:56.041
- He's a very nice boy, Mama.
- No.

743
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:59.041
- He promised to stop in and meet you.
- I said no.

744
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:02.041
- Mama, I've accepted. I've accepted.
- I said no. No, no, no!

745
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:03.166
I've accepted!

746
00:46:03.832 --> 00:46:06.041
- Come to your closet.
- No.

747
00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:09.166
- After all you've been taught...
- Everyone isn't bad, Mama!

748
00:46:09.374 --> 00:46:11.041
Everything isn't a sin!

749
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:14.041
Come to your closet and pray.
Ask to be forgiven.

750
00:46:14.874 --> 00:46:18.749
He's a nice boy, Mama. You'll like him.
You'll really like him, Mama.

751
00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:20.749
Boys.

752
00:46:21.749 --> 00:46:23.041
[laughs]

753
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:26.582
The boys! The boys!
Yes, the boys...

754
00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:30.041
After the blood
come the boys...

755
00:46:30.041 --> 00:46:32.041
- Mama...
- Like sniffing dogs,

756
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:36.041
grinning and slobbering and trying
to find out where that smell comes from.

757
00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:38.041
Where the smell is.
That smell.

758
00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:42.041
Listen, I know where they take them
in their cars, I've seen it all!

759
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:45.041
- Well, you're not going.
- Already said I would.

760
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:49.041
Tell that boy you're not going,
or we're gonna move from here!

761
00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:50.041
No.

762
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:53.041
We'll move from here
and never see that boy again!

763
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:57.207
- Mama, please say that Tommy and me...
- The rain's coming in. I'm gonna close the window.

764
00:46:57.916 --> 00:47:00.041
Mama, please sit and talk to me!

765
00:47:00.041 --> 00:47:03.041
- [suspenseful music]
- [windows slamming shut]

766
00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:05.041
[thunder crashing]

767
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:12.041
I'm goin', Mama.

768
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:15.874
And things are gonna change
around here.

769
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:19.041
Witch.

770
00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:22.499
Got Satan's power.

771
00:47:23.541 --> 00:47:25.666
It's nothin' to do
with Satan, Mama.

772
00:47:25.666 --> 00:47:28.041
It's me. Me.

773
00:47:28.041 --> 00:47:31.291
If I concentrate hard enough,
I can move things.

774
00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:34.207
- Satan is clever.
- No, Mama.

775
00:47:35.374 --> 00:47:37.374
I'm not the only one.

776
00:47:38.082 --> 00:47:40.707
Other people can do it.
I read about it.

777
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:44.041
You poor child. Don't you know?

778
00:47:44.749 --> 00:47:47.041
He doesn't let you know
he's working through you.

779
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:50.041
Mama... I know.

780
00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:52.041
He entered your father
and carried him off!

781
00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:57.041
- He ran away, Mama.
- The devil tempted him!

782
00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.416
He ran away with a woman, Mama.

783
00:47:59.916 --> 00:48:02.041
Everybody knows that.

784
00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:06.041
You must renounce this power.
You must give it up. You must never use it.

785
00:48:08.499 --> 00:48:10.041
I'm goin', Mama.

786
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:14.041
You can't stop me.

787
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:16.499
And I don't wanna
talk about it any more.

788
00:48:17.041 --> 00:48:20.041
[dramatic music playing]

789
00:48:33.499 --> 00:48:37.041
- [Billy] You keep that damn light straight.
- [Chris] Hurry up!

790
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:40.624
Watch it, you stupid shit!
You're getting blood all over the place!

791
00:48:40.624 --> 00:48:41.624
[Billy scoffs]

792
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:45.041
Who you calling a stupid shit?

793
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.707
I mean, you can't even keep
that fuckin' light straight.

794
00:48:47.707 --> 00:48:49.041
[Chris] Just hurry up.

795
00:48:49.041 --> 00:48:50.041
[liquid pouring]

796
00:48:50.041 --> 00:48:54.541
Yes, ma'am! We's doin' the bes' we can!
We really are, boss!

797
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:57.041
Hurry up. I wanna go home.

798
00:48:57.041 --> 00:48:59.041
[liquid continues pouring]

799
00:48:59.041 --> 00:49:00.041
[thud]

800
00:49:01.707 --> 00:49:04.249
Just... keep your tits on.

801
00:49:04.707 --> 00:49:07.707
And I'll let you pull the rope
when the time comes.

802
00:49:08.707 --> 00:49:09.707
I plan to.

803
00:49:10.249 --> 00:49:11.707
I know.

804
00:49:13.707 --> 00:49:15.457
[dramatic music]

805
00:49:30.707 --> 00:49:34.166
Ernest, listen tonight's prom night
and everything, right?

806
00:49:34.707 --> 00:49:38.707
- I didn't know you were interested in going.
- What do you mean? I'm a student here, ain't 1?

807
00:49:38.874 --> 00:49:42.707
- I don't know. Are you?
- Sure I am. I got so much spirit in this school,

808
00:49:42.707 --> 00:49:44.041
I wanna be on the committee.

809
00:49:44.207 --> 00:49:47.707
You're a little late, Freddy. I could've used you
a week ago on the decorating committee.

810
00:49:48.082 --> 00:49:52.707
No, I'm not late, Ernest. I'm right on time, pal.
You know, I wanna collect the ballots. You know,

811
00:49:52.707 --> 00:49:55.916
for the king and queen and the voting,
and the, you know?

812
00:49:56.624 --> 00:50:00.707
- Think we could arrange that?
- Okay. Can you be here at 6:307

813
00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:02.957
No. No, I can't be here at 6:30.

814
00:50:03.666 --> 00:50:05.707
I'll be here at 8. How's 8?

815
00:50:05.707 --> 00:50:08.707
- Yeah, that'll do. Okay.
- 8's fine with me. Okay, well, we'll see you then.

816
00:50:08.707 --> 00:50:12.249
- Yeah, see you Freddy. Take it easy.
- I'll take it any way I can get it, pal.

817
00:50:12.249 --> 00:50:13.707
Hey, Helen.

818
00:50:13.999 --> 00:50:15.707
Helen!

819
00:50:15.707 --> 00:50:16.541
Helen!

820
00:50:16.707 --> 00:50:18.707
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

821
00:50:19.207 --> 00:50:22.291
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

822
00:50:22.457 --> 00:50:25.707
- What?
- He's taking Carrie White to the prom.

823
00:50:25.707 --> 00:50:27.707
- No!
- Yeah!

824
00:50:27.707 --> 00:50:29.707
[laughing]

825
00:50:29.707 --> 00:50:32.499
[Helen] When did that happen? He can't do that!

826
00:50:32.499 --> 00:50:34.082
- Where's Sue?
- [girl] Yes, he can. He asked her.

827
00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:36.707
- [Helen] What's she gonna wear?
- [girl] Who, Carrie?

828
00:50:36.707 --> 00:50:39.707
- [Helen] A sackcloth?!
- [girls laughing]

829
00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:43.707
- [Sue] Sweetie, keep those stars coming faster.
- They're coming.

830
00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:47.707
What's this I hear about Tommy
taking Carrie to the prom?

831
00:50:47.707 --> 00:50:49.707
[Sue] Whatever you heard,
it's true.

832
00:50:49.707 --> 00:50:50.707
[scoffs]

833
00:50:50.999 --> 00:50:53.999
Why is he doing it?
Everybody is talking about it.

834
00:50:54.707 --> 00:50:57.707
I asked him to
cause I thought I owed it to Carrie.

835
00:50:57.707 --> 00:51:01.041
- Where's that put everybody else?
- They gotta deal with it in their own way.

836
00:51:01.207 --> 00:51:03.707
- What do you mean?
- Oh... just something.

837
00:51:03.707 --> 00:51:07.707
- Well, you're not going to the prom.
- Oh, I'll be here.

838
00:51:07.707 --> 00:51:09.166
- You'll be here?
- I sure will.

839
00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.707
What do you mean, you're going to the prom?

840
00:51:10.707 --> 00:51:13.707
Shut up. I will tell you later.
You're gonna be in on it, don't worry about a thing.

841
00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:15.916
I'm gonna be in on it? What?

842
00:51:15.916 --> 00:51:17.707
I'll tell you later!

843
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:22.624
- I want to know now, Chris. You can't give me a hint?
- Just wait.

844
00:51:22.707 --> 00:51:28.707
I won't tell anybody, I promise. I won't say
a word. I promise, I'm your best friend. Come on.

845
00:51:28.707 --> 00:51:29.707
Okay.

846
00:51:30.707 --> 00:51:32.707
[funk music playing]

847
00:51:33.707 --> 00:51:34.832
[no audible dialogue]

848
00:52:03.707 --> 00:52:08.707
- You gotta rent yourself a tuxedo for the prom.
- I know, I only got 10 bucks, though.

849
00:52:08.707 --> 00:52:10.707
You can rent yourself a tuxedo!
You don't have to look great!

850
00:52:10.707 --> 00:52:11.707
Hey.

851
00:52:11.707 --> 00:52:12.707
[whistles]

852
00:52:12.707 --> 00:52:14.332
Does this look nice?

853
00:52:14.332 --> 00:52:17.707
He looks beautiful. You can look good.
Make a good impression for once in your life.

854
00:52:17.707 --> 00:52:19.707
- Would you go out with me?
- Not with ruffles.

855
00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:23.707
You don't have to get ruffles for yourself.
You always gotta make a joke, right?

856
00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:26.707
- I don't like ruffles...
- You don't have to get ruffles!

857
00:52:26.707 --> 00:52:28.707
Alright, now look at me, Beak.
Don't I look sharp?

858
00:52:28.707 --> 00:52:32.582
It looks good on you,
but I don't look right in a tuxedo.

859
00:52:32.707 --> 00:52:34.874
- How do you know? Have you ever put on a tuxedo?
- I don't have a tuxedo body.

860
00:52:34.999 --> 00:52:36.707
[conversation speeds up]

861
00:52:38.707 --> 00:52:42.707
- I know they have tuxedos here for you.
- But I wouldn't look right in it.

862
00:52:42.707 --> 00:52:44.707
Wait a second.
I know just the tuxedo for him.

863
00:52:44.707 --> 00:52:49.707
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it. I think it's terrific.

864
00:52:49.707 --> 00:52:51.707
Look at that. No ruffles at all!

865
00:53:02.332 --> 00:53:05.707
[Mrs. White]
Red. I might've known it would be red.

866
00:53:06.707 --> 00:53:08.541
It's pink, Mama.

867
00:53:10.582 --> 00:53:12.582
Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.

868
00:53:12.582 --> 00:53:14.457

Mama?

1263
01:26:03.207 --> 01:26:06.999
Mama? Mama, it was bad, Mama.

1264
01:26:06.999 --> 01:26:08.999
They laughed at me.

1265
01:26:08.999 --> 01:26:11.999
Mama, hold me.

1266
01:26:11.999 --> 01:26:14.999
Mama, please, hold me.

1268

Hold me, Mama.

1269
01:26:24.874 --> 01:26:26.874
Please, hold me!

1270
01:26:29.374 --> 01:26:32.374
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

1271
01:26:34.082 --> 01:26:36.374
After the first time,
before we were married.

1272
01:26:36.916 --> 01:26:38.416
Ralph promised never again.

1273
01:26:41.374 --> 01:26:44.374
He promised, and I believed him.

1274
01:26:47.374 --> 01:26:49.374
But sin never dies.

1275
01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:53.374
Sin never dies.

1276
01:26:54.624 --> 01:26:56.457
At first it was all right.

1277
01:26:57.166 --> 01:26:58.374
We lived sinlessly.

1278
01:26:59.374 --> 01:27:02.374
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

1279
01:27:04.374 --> 01:27:08.374
And then, that night,

1280
01:27:10.374 --> 01:27:13.374
I saw him looking down
at me that way.

1281
01:27:17.374 --> 01:27:20.582
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

1282
01:27:22.582 --> 01:27:25.374
I smelled the whisky
on his breath.

1283
01:27:27.582 --> 01:27:31.374
And he took me... he took me.

1284
01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:38.374
With the stink of the filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

1285
01:27:38.374 --> 01:27:40.374
And I liked it.

1286
01:27:41.374 --> 01:27:42.374
I liked it!

1287
01:27:45.374 --> 01:27:49.374
Well, all that dirty touching
of his hands all over me...

1288
01:27:50.374 --> 01:27:53.374
I should have given you to God
when you were born.

1289
01:27:54.374 --> 01:27:57.374
But I was weak and backsliding.

1290
01:28:01.374 --> 01:28:04.374
But now the devil has come home.

1291
01:28:05.374 --> 01:28:06.374
Oh!

1292
01:28:09.374 --> 01:28:10.374
We'll pray.

1293
01:28:10.374 --> 01:28:11.416
Yes.

1294
01:28:12.374 --> 01:28:14.124
We'll pray.

1295
01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:16.957
We'll pray.

1296
01:28:18.374 --> 01:28:19.374
We'll pray.

1297
01:28:20.374 --> 01:28:21.457
For the last time,

1298
01:28:22.374 --> 01:28:23.832
we'll pray.

1300

Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:36.374
Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done...

Hello?

1343
01:33:59.749 --> 01:34:01.916
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.

1344
01:34:01.916 --> 01:34:04.916
I don't think I could have
handled one more reporter.

1345
01:34:06.916 --> 01:34:10.916
Yeah, well,
we're all a little edgy.

1346
01:34:12.916 --> 01:34:16.916
She's better. Well, uh,
sleeping too much, I guess,

1347
01:34:16.916 --> 01:34:21.457
but Dr. Schnieder said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

1348
01:34:23.499 --> 01:34:28.916
Well, he said that she's young enough,
so that she'll forget all about it in time.

1349
01:34:28.916 --> 01:34:34.916
No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals,
with Tommy and all the others gone.

1350
01:34:34.916 --> 01:34:37.374
It's best we just
go away for a while.
