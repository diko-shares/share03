00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:57.892
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1
00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:15.820
I'm gonna be a dad!

2
00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:19.240
I just talked to my wife.
My baby's gonna be delivered any minute.

3
00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:22.167
- Hey, get out of the way.
- Hey, I'm gonna be a dad.

4
00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:24.122
Congratulate me.

5
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.547
Good for you, Herb.

6
00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:32.426
Don't even think about it.

7
00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:34.465
Hey!

8
00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.018
Sorry. How are you?
Nice to see you. I'm gonna be a dad!

9
00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:40.804
Congrats!

10
00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.936
Hey, Mr. Nuts,
did you hear the news?

11
00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:45.766
- Yeah.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

12
00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:49.776
I'm here. I'm here.

13
00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:53.197
- I'm here.
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.157
You missed the delivery.

15
00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:01.154
It's okay.
Making the baby's the fun part.

16
00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:22.724
Honey, I think
you've got the wrong...

17
00:02:23.437 --> 00:02:26.438
No, I don't need to see the directions.

18
00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:43.622
Push, push.

19
00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.410
Push!

20
00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:00.422
Twelve hours of labor.

21
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.433
Oh, but it was worth it.

22
00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:04.808
Look at him. Look at him.

23
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.393
Rodney Copperbottom.

24
00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:10.062
He's got your mom's eyes
and my dad's nose.

25
00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:12.559
I knew we were smart
to save those parts.

26
00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:15.987
This Copperbottom will do great things
for the world, I can feel it.

27
00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:17.485
- Honey?
- What?

28
00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:19.734
What's that extra piece?

29
00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:23.281
Oh, no, they always put in an extra...

30
00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:26.199
We did want a boy, right?

31
00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:31.334
This won't hurt a bit, son.

32
00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:40.845
Got your nose. Got your nose.

33
00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:42.717
Got your...

34
00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:06.078
- Hi, son.
- Are those my big-boy parts?

35
00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.873
They sure are.

36
00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:12.454
They're not shiny.

37
00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:16.337
Well, they're not brand-new.
They're preowned. So...

38
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.216
They're hand-me-downs
from your cousin Jeffrey.

39
00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:21.972
And they're only for a year.

40
00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:50.659
Hey, Dad, who's that?

41
00:04:50.835 --> 00:04:53.160
That, Rodney, is Bigweld.

42
00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.502
The greatest robot in the world.

43
00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:58.632
I thought you were
the greatest robot in the world.

44
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:00.426
No, besides me.

45
00:05:00.595 --> 00:05:02.421
He's the head of Bigweld Industries.

46
00:05:02.638 --> 00:05:05.758
He invents things
that make everyone's life better.

47
00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:08.976
- Could I meet him?
- Sure, maybe someday.

48
00:05:09.186 --> 00:05:10.515
- Dad?
- Yeah?

49
00:05:10.688 --> 00:05:14.472
- What do you do?
- Me? I work in a big, fancy restaurant.

50
00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:17.017
I'm a dishwasher.

51
00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.817
<i>And now, live from Robot City,</i>
<i>it's</i> The Bigweld Show.

52
00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:29.413
Oh, yeah!

53
00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:32.619
Come on, Dad, you're missing it.

54
00:05:32.793 --> 00:05:35.284
All right, Rodney.
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

55
00:05:35.463 --> 00:05:37.835
I had to bring work home
with me again, I'm sorry.

56
00:05:38.007 --> 00:05:39.964
Mr. Gunk has really been piling it on.

57
00:05:40.134 --> 00:05:44.084
<i>And now, the host of our show,</i>
<i>Bigweld</i>.

58
00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:48.759
<i>Welcome. This week I thought you'd like</i>
<i>to take a look around Bigweld Industries</i>.

59
00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:52.926
<i>This here is the front gate.
Kind of cute, ain't it?</i>

60
00:05:54.982 --> 00:05:58.232
- Good morning, Tim.
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.

61
00:05:58.444 --> 00:06:00.484
Tim, who closed the front gate?

62
00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:02.938
Well, I just thought since...

63
00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:06.023
We never shut the gate, Tim.

64
00:06:06.244 --> 00:06:09.410
Shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas.

65
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.202
See, every day, robots come here
from hither and yon...

66
00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:14.581
...bringing us new ideas.

67
00:06:15.753 --> 00:06:18.873
And I listen to
every single one of them.

68
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:28.760
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

69
00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:31.685
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

70
00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:33.934
He's talking to me, Dad.

71
00:06:34.105 --> 00:06:36.975
He sure is, son. He sure is.

72
00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:40.565
<i>Okay, folks, let's get to inventing</i>.

73
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.532
<i>You know, I love to tinker</i>...

74
00:06:46.742 --> 00:06:51.819
<i>...but all the tinkering in the world isn't</i>
<i>useful unless it starts with a good idea</i>.

75
00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:59.414
So look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need.

76
00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:03.289
One idea will lead to another,
and before you know it...

77
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:08.712
...you've done it.
See a need, fill a need.

78
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:12.383
That's it, Dad. I have to look for...

79
00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:16.640
...a need.

80
00:07:29.493 --> 00:07:30.822
Easy, now.

81
00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:49.422
- Hey there, sport.
- Oh, hi.

82
00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.556
These are your 12-year-old parts.
They're...

83
00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:55.388
Hand-me-downs. I know, Dad.

84
00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:58.645
- I don't mind.
- They are from your cousin...

85
00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:00.267
...Veronica.

86
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:03.062
You know how popular she is.

87
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:30.671
Thanks.

88
00:08:44.402 --> 00:08:45.777
Oh, hey. Hey.

89
00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:50.818
Soon as you reach the age where your
warranty expires, you start falling apart.

90
00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:53.524
Pretty soon there's gonna be
more duct tape than me.

91
00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:57.072
- Can I try it now, Dad?
- Oh, Rodney...

92
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.287
- Have you worked all the kinks out of it?
- This is gonna make your job easy.

93
00:09:01.502 --> 00:09:03.495
I invented it for you.

94
00:09:06.382 --> 00:09:08.209
Okay. Let's try it.

95
00:09:08.426 --> 00:09:11.130
Great. Okay, this is it.

96
00:09:11.304 --> 00:09:14.838
Wonderbot, go to work.

97
00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:30.189
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:41.114
Hey!

99
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:11.613
Copperbottom!

100
00:10:11.822 --> 00:10:13.151
- Mr. Gunk.
- What is that?

101
00:10:13.324 --> 00:10:16.194
- Oh, that. My son made it.
- What's it doing?

102
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.360
Mr. Gunk, please,
you're making it nervous.

103
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:22.870
It's wrecking my kitchen!

104
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:26.575
- I'll stop it.
- No!

105
00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:31.628
Your son, huh?

106
00:10:31.842 --> 00:10:34.215
It wasn't his fault.
He had nothing to do with it.

107
00:10:34.387 --> 00:10:36.878
Yes, sir, he's a brilliant boy.
An inventor.

108
00:10:37.098 --> 00:10:41.095
You, clean up this mess.
And, you, get out.

109
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.639
Inventor.

110
00:10:42.812 --> 00:10:46.560
You're the hand-me-down son of a
dishwasher, and that's all you'll ever be.

111
00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:51.275
Somebody scrape this crud off of me.
And serve it to the customers.

112
00:10:52.405 --> 00:10:53.733
<i>Round-trip or one-way?</i>

113
00:10:53.948 --> 00:10:55.822
One-way.

114
00:10:58.577 --> 00:11:02.077
There you are. I told you I'd find him.

115
00:11:02.248 --> 00:11:05.831
- It's a mother's instinct.
- Instinct? He left us a note:

116
00:11:06.002 --> 00:11:08.457
"I'm leaving.
I'll be at the train station."

117
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:11.292
Never mind. Pick up that suitcase.
You're coming home.

118
00:11:11.507 --> 00:11:15.754
No, Mom. I have to do this.
I'm going to Robot City tonight.

119
00:11:15.928 --> 00:11:18.846
I'm gonna get a job and I'm gonna
help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.

120
00:11:19.056 --> 00:11:20.385
Talk to him.

121
00:11:20.558 --> 00:11:23.393
- Ro...
- Robot City? You're just a kid.

122
00:11:23.603 --> 00:11:25.679
I'm never gonna be someone here.

123
00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:28.560
I wanna be an inventor.
I wanna meet Bigweld.

124
00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:30.143
I wanna be somebody.

125
00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:31.818
You are somebody.

126
00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:34.311
Somebody who's not
getting on that train.

127
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.065
- Yes, I am.
- Talk to him.

128
00:11:40.911 --> 00:11:43.747
- One ticket for Robot City.
- Where are you going?

129
00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:47.076
- Not me. Him.
- But...

130
00:11:47.293 --> 00:11:51.919
Rodney, did you know that when I was
your age, I wanted to be a musician?

131
00:11:52.423 --> 00:11:54.629
I played pretty well too...

132
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.801
...but my dad was worried
I wouldn't be able to make a living.

133
00:11:58.012 --> 00:12:01.926
So I got refitted to be a dishwasher.
Now, I'm not complaining.

134
00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:05.136
But I've always said to myself...

135
00:12:05.811 --> 00:12:10.520
...if I could do it over again,
I would follow my dream.

136
00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:13.815
You've got greatness in you, Rodney.

137
00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.528
Never doubt it.

138
00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:17.612
You go to Robot City.

139
00:12:17.782 --> 00:12:22.111
You go meet Bigweld,
and you show him your big ideas.

140
00:12:22.286 --> 00:12:23.615
And, Rodney...

141
00:12:23.788 --> 00:12:27.620
...never, never give up.

142
00:12:42.932 --> 00:12:45.637
All aboard.

143
00:12:49.313 --> 00:12:51.057
Mom.

144
00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:05.401
I won't let you down, Dad.

145
00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:06.990
I'll make you proud.

146
00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:12.078
I know you will.

147
00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:05.304
Excuse me, I wonder if...

148
00:14:05.473 --> 00:14:07.300
- Gave at the office.
- I wonder if you...

149
00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:09.551
Could you direct me
to Bigweld Indust...?

150
00:14:09.727 --> 00:14:12.099
- What?
- Perfect. That will be 50 bucks.

151
00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:13.552
Fifty bucks? For what?

152
00:14:13.731 --> 00:14:16.352
A beautiful picture
of your first moment in Robot City.

153
00:14:16.525 --> 00:14:18.684
There. Your second moment.
That's another $50.

154
00:14:18.903 --> 00:14:20.694
Are you keeping track?

155
00:14:21.364 --> 00:14:24.400
Come on, work with me, work with me.
More pout, less pose.

156
00:14:24.617 --> 00:14:27.534
Great. Inside of you is a fashion model
waiting to throw up.

157
00:14:27.745 --> 00:14:31.079
Give me those eyes. Big eyes, big eyes.
Give me big animé eyes.

158
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:35.577
- Yeah! Loving it, loving it, loving it!
- I don't want any pictures.

159
00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:37.170
- You don't?
- No.

160
00:14:37.338 --> 00:14:41.205
That's all right. There's no film.
Would you like a map to the stars' homes?

161
00:14:41.384 --> 00:14:43.092
Where did he go?

162
00:15:01.862 --> 00:15:06.192
- Buddy, wanna buy a watch?
- Don't buy us, we're fakes.

163
00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:08.069
Next.

164
00:15:17.753 --> 00:15:20.327
Excuse me, how do I get
to Bigweld Industries?

165
00:15:20.506 --> 00:15:21.834
Oh, great...

166
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.761
Never mind.

167
00:15:39.442 --> 00:15:42.692
Hi, excuse me.
How do I get to Bigweld Industries?

168
00:15:46.198 --> 00:15:47.574
What?

169
00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:53.120
Yeah, thanks.

170
00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:55.614

<i>to Foundry District</i>...

171
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:58.662
<i>...with stops at Bigweld Industries</i>
<i>and Battery Park only</i>.

172
00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:03.875
<i>Please tighten all spools, nuts, bolts</i>
<i>and detachable appendages</i>.

173
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:08.130
<i>Riders with high oil pressure</i>

174
00:16:08.304 --> 00:16:11.221
<i>Thank you, and have a nice day</i>.

175
00:16:23.277 --> 00:16:25.566
No, no.

176
00:16:32.662 --> 00:16:35.153
- Say, are you following me?
- No.

177
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:38.166
- First time on the cross-town express?
- Well, actually, I...

178
00:16:38.334 --> 00:16:39.662
Oh, boy.

179
00:16:39.877 --> 00:16:43.460
Good luck in the big city. If you can
make it here, you can make it anywhere.

180
00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:47.421
And if you can't make it here,
welcome to the club.

181
00:16:56.394 --> 00:16:57.639
- Oh, no.
- What? What is it?

182
00:16:57.853 --> 00:16:59.727
We're going off the track.
We're gonna crash!

183
00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:02.311
- What?
- I don't wanna die.

184
00:17:12.618 --> 00:17:16.367
I was just kidding.
Just put your head between your legs.

185
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:24.879
Yeah!

186
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.673
There goes my stop.

187
00:17:50.531 --> 00:17:53.485
I tell you, the things that fall off me...
It's embarrassing.

188
00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:15.090
Sorry.

189
00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:31.693
You know, it used to be a lot worse.
They had this giant hammer...

190
00:18:31.864 --> 00:18:33.489
Oh, they brought it back.

191
00:18:57.306 --> 00:18:59.465
Stick with me. I know this town
like the back of my hand.

192
00:18:59.642 --> 00:19:01.967
Hey, that's new.

193
00:19:23.916 --> 00:19:26.372
Excuse me. Can I help you?

194
00:19:26.585 --> 00:19:28.245
Sorry, I...

195
00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:33.420
- Hey, you're Tim from the TV show.
- That's me.

196
00:19:33.634 --> 00:19:34.963
Well, hey, Tim.

197
00:19:35.136 --> 00:19:38.006
Who closed the gate?
It's never supposed to be...

198
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.556
Yeah, okay, what do you want?

199
00:19:41.225 --> 00:19:43.514
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

200
00:19:43.686 --> 00:19:46.438
I'm an inventor.

201
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.181
Oh, why didn't you say so?

202
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:52.477
Stand back.

203
00:20:10.046 --> 00:20:11.837
Thanks.

204
00:20:12.048 --> 00:20:13.542
What?

205
00:20:13.841 --> 00:20:17.210
I got you. You see, because you were
all excited and then, boom!

206
00:20:18.971 --> 00:20:21.972
All right, I had my laugh. Go on in.

207
00:20:27.396 --> 00:20:29.056
Now, that's funny.

208
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:32.017
The second time.

209
00:20:32.193 --> 00:20:36.606
You really think I'm gonna let you in.
But I'm not.

210
00:20:36.822 --> 00:20:39.658
Sorry, kid, nobody gets in.
Company rules.

211
00:20:39.867 --> 00:20:43.034
Company ru...? Well, then
how do they hire new inventors?

212
00:20:43.245 --> 00:20:45.571
They don't. Those days are over.

213
00:20:45.748 --> 00:20:49.959
My advice: Come back two years ago.
Then the job is yours.

214
00:21:03.349 --> 00:21:08.390
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

215
00:21:08.604 --> 00:21:10.929
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

216
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:15.642
My goodness,
what a remarkable legacy.

217
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.737
Concern for the common robot.

218
00:21:18.948 --> 00:21:23.242
You don't come across old-fashioned
values like that anymore, friends.

219
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:24.953
And for good reason.

220
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:27.030
There's no money in it!

221
00:21:27.206 --> 00:21:31.038
Hello? Memo to Bigweld:
We're not a charity.

222
00:21:31.252 --> 00:21:34.336
That's why old fat face
no longer sits in the big chair.

223
00:21:34.505 --> 00:21:35.999
He's a relic.

224
00:21:36.215 --> 00:21:40.462
So I don't wanna hear another,
"Where's Bigweld?"

225
00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:46.470
We'll see him next month at the
Bigweld Ball. He always goes to that.

226
00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:52.811
Now, let's get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny...

227
00:21:52.982 --> 00:21:55.983
...out of
Mr. And Mrs. Average-Knucklehead.

228
00:21:56.569 --> 00:21:57.897
What's our big-ticket item?

229
00:22:04.994 --> 00:22:07.283
Upgrades, people. Upgrades.

230
00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:09.032
That's how we make the dough.

231
00:22:09.206 --> 00:22:13.999
Now, if we're telling robots that no matter
what they're made of, they're "fine"...

232
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.621
...how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves...

233
00:22:17.798 --> 00:22:20.420
...to buy our upgrades
and make themselves look better?

234
00:22:20.635 --> 00:22:24.086
Therefore, I've come up
with a new slogan.

235
00:22:24.305 --> 00:22:27.888
"Why be you when you can be new?"

236
00:22:30.645 --> 00:22:33.349
I gotta tell you, I think it's brilliant...

237
00:22:33.522 --> 00:22:39.608
...but, honestly, I'd like to hear
what you employees think about this.

238
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:42.900
- Hear, hear.
- Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.

239
00:22:48.788 --> 00:22:50.412
Just don't look down.

240
00:23:01.592 --> 00:23:02.623
Hey.

241
00:23:04.512 --> 00:23:06.172
Get off.

242
00:23:06.764 --> 00:23:08.424
Go on, get off.

243
00:23:10.268 --> 00:23:11.927
Get off of...

244
00:23:12.144 --> 00:23:14.814
Cappy, you haven't said a word.

245
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:18.848
- It gave me chills.
- Thank you, thank you.

246
00:23:19.068 --> 00:23:20.977
- But...
- But?

247
00:23:21.195 --> 00:23:25.145
I'm just wondering,
why would robots buy new upgrades...

248
00:23:25.324 --> 00:23:27.994
...if parts are so much cheaper?

249
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.449
Oh, right. Well, that's easy.

250
00:23:30.621 --> 00:23:35.616
Because as of today,
we are no longer making spare parts.

251
00:23:35.835 --> 00:23:39.963
Do you know what I call robots
who can't afford upgrades? Scrap metal.

252
00:23:40.131 --> 00:23:43.334
You see them on the streets,
misshapen and rust-covered.

253
00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:48.260
They turn your insides out.
You wanna run home and scrub yourself.

254
00:23:48.431 --> 00:23:51.385
Now, Cappy, I want your department
to push our new slogan.

255
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.436
In fact, I'm moving you
into the office right next to mine.

256
00:23:54.604 --> 00:23:58.138
We'll be working very,
very closely together on this one.

257
00:23:58.316 --> 00:24:00.392
- Won't that be fun?
- Oodles.

258
00:24:12.371 --> 00:24:14.697
- Oh, so sorry, I...
- What the...?

259
00:24:14.915 --> 00:24:21.250
Sir, I am a young inventor, and it has
been my dream to come to Robot City...

260
00:24:21.464 --> 00:24:24.833
...and to present my ideas
to Mr. Bigweld.

261
00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:26.669
Who doesn't seem to be here.

262
00:24:27.094 --> 00:24:31.424
Gee, no, no. But while he's away,
he left me in charge.

263
00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:34.392
Oh, well, then let me show you
what this can do.

264
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:40.268
I have a better idea. Why don't you
let me show you what it can do.

265
00:24:40.441 --> 00:24:41.769
It can do this!

266
00:25:03.923 --> 00:25:05.465
So how did it go?

267
00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:11.920
What the heck
is going on around here?

268
00:25:12.098 --> 00:25:16.676
Some highly polished jerk
is sitting in Bigweld's chair.

269
00:25:17.478 --> 00:25:21.428
And you're sitting
on the sidewalk, magnetized.

270
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:25.860
Listen, I'll be back,
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

271
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.106
When you pick a lost cause,
you really commit.

272
00:25:29.282 --> 00:25:32.982
Where do they make dreamers like you?
Get lost, freak!

273
00:27:40.288 --> 00:27:42.446
All right, break time.

274
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.749
All right, break time's over.

275
00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.712
Chop-chop.

276
00:27:52.091 --> 00:27:53.669
Look who's here.

277
00:27:53.884 --> 00:27:57.716
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie. How's my boy?

278
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:02.224
Great. I did just what you told me.
No more spare parts.

279
00:28:02.393 --> 00:28:06.521
In a couple of weeks, those broken-down
losers out there will be scrap metal.

280
00:28:06.731 --> 00:28:09.566
You will be up to your bloomers
in broken-elbow junk.

281
00:28:09.775 --> 00:28:11.483
Such a good boy.

282
00:28:11.652 --> 00:28:13.312
And after you finish off Bigweld...

283
00:28:13.487 --> 00:28:15.646
...there will be nobody
out there to fix them.

284
00:28:15.865 --> 00:28:17.857
Exactly!

285
00:28:18.075 --> 00:28:20.068
You wanna swing that one
by me again?

286
00:28:20.286 --> 00:28:23.571
Idiot! Those outmodes look up to him.

287
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:27.324
- Suppose he decides to come back?
- Oh, come on, Mom.

288
00:28:27.543 --> 00:28:30.912
- He's not gonna be trouble where he is.
- What are you afraid of?

289
00:28:31.088 --> 00:28:32.417
Grow some bolts.

290
00:28:32.632 --> 00:28:35.087
Or do you want to end up
like your father?

291
00:28:35.384 --> 00:28:37.673
Hey, son. Good to see you.

292
00:28:37.887 --> 00:28:39.346
Think what it would mean.

293
00:28:39.513 --> 00:28:44.389
Not Bigweld Industries,
Ratchet Industries.

294
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.889
Keep talking.

295
00:28:46.062 --> 00:28:48.683
Ratchet City!

296
00:28:48.856 --> 00:28:51.892
Yes, everything shiny.

297
00:28:52.068 --> 00:28:56.017
No more Bigweld, no more outmode.

298
00:28:56.197 --> 00:28:58.024
Let's do it!

299
00:28:58.199 --> 00:29:00.275
That's my boy!

300
00:29:08.334 --> 00:29:10.373
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something?

301
00:29:10.544 --> 00:29:14.459
- You look thin.
- No, no, no, Mom. I gotta go. Bye.

302
00:29:14.632 --> 00:29:15.794
Bye, Pop.

303
00:29:16.008 --> 00:29:19.009
So long, son.
Good luck with your dastardly plans.

304
00:29:43.202 --> 00:29:44.910
Hey.

305
00:29:45.538 --> 00:29:47.162
Hi there.

306
00:29:47.331 --> 00:29:53.334
Listen, if I seem to be getting smaller,
it's because I'm leaving.

307
00:29:53.796 --> 00:29:55.255
Foot, don't fail me now.

308
00:29:55.464 --> 00:29:58.465
Stop! Hey, you got my foot!

309
00:30:41.802 --> 00:30:44.554
Oh, great. Happy now?

310
00:30:44.764 --> 00:30:47.967
Not until you give me back
my foot, you mugger.

311
00:30:48.184 --> 00:30:51.932
I am not a mugger. I happen to be...

312
00:30:52.104 --> 00:30:53.184
...a scrounger.

313
00:30:53.397 --> 00:30:55.723
I didn't know you were
at the end of that foot.

314
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.225
Here, let me help you with that.

315
00:30:58.444 --> 00:30:59.938
No, no, no, I'll do it myself.

316
00:31:00.112 --> 00:31:02.235
I have my pride, you know. Over here.

317
00:31:02.406 --> 00:31:05.941
Oh, no. No, not that close.
Hold on, hold on.

318
00:31:06.118 --> 00:31:07.826
No. No, no.

319
00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:13.583
What's the use? There's nothing left.

320
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:17.416
Hey, Diesel, I found you a voice box.

321
00:31:27.056 --> 00:31:28.384
Here's another one.

322
00:31:30.267 --> 00:31:32.307
That's no good. Give me that.

323
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.229
I can never find parts in my size.

324
00:31:41.028 --> 00:31:43.068
What is it, boy?

325
00:31:43.906 --> 00:31:46.314
Hey, Fender, have you lost weight?

326
00:31:46.492 --> 00:31:48.532
Lost weight?

327
00:31:48.703 --> 00:31:52.072
Look at where you're looking.
He's a head in a basket.

328
00:31:52.248 --> 00:31:54.490
We're doomed, I knew it.
We're doomed.

329
00:31:54.709 --> 00:31:58.706
Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic nut?
Why, I'd smack you if I had a hand.

330
00:32:00.506 --> 00:32:02.415
Wow, speak of the devil, here I come.

331
00:32:03.718 --> 00:32:04.749
Dang!

332
00:32:06.178 --> 00:32:07.507
Check this out.

333
00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:11.340
Who would throw away
such a cute little doodad?

334
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.352
- Don't be scared.
- Hey, that's mine.

335
00:32:14.812 --> 00:32:17.932
That's him. That's the guy.
I would know that face.

336
00:32:18.107 --> 00:32:20.978
I know that face,
and I know that foot.

337
00:32:21.652 --> 00:32:23.230
He's over there, moron.

338
00:32:23.404 --> 00:32:25.729
That's the perpetrator.
He knocked my head off.

339
00:32:25.906 --> 00:32:28.658
- You want another piece of me?
- All right, buster.

340
00:32:28.826 --> 00:32:32.824
If you think you can mess with my
big brother, you're... You're kind of cute.

341
00:32:33.331 --> 00:32:35.619
Piper, would you behave yourself.

342
00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:38.579
Now, come on,
let's get Fender fixed. Again.

343
00:32:38.878 --> 00:32:41.285
Here's your thingamabob.

344
00:32:41.464 --> 00:32:43.706
By the way, the name's Piper.

345
00:32:43.883 --> 00:32:46.041
Rhymes with "viper."

346
00:32:47.303 --> 00:32:49.011
See you around.

347
00:32:53.809 --> 00:32:55.968
We've told you a hundred times:

348
00:32:56.145 --> 00:32:58.351
"Don't talk to strange men."
Thank you, Manuel.

349
00:32:58.564 --> 00:33:01.648
I talk to you.
Who's stranger than that?

350
00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:11.985
I got good news, and I got bad news.

351
00:33:12.203 --> 00:33:14.575
- What's the bad news?
- I checked the stock book.

352
00:33:14.747 --> 00:33:18.081
And as of today, they are no longer
making parts for your model.

353
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.872
You have been officially outmoded.

354
00:33:21.087 --> 00:33:22.629
Outmoded? Well, that's fine.

355
00:33:22.797 --> 00:33:24.374
What's the good news?!

356
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:29.382
Well, when we had your parts,
they were on sale.

357
00:33:34.475 --> 00:33:38.687
How could this happen to me?
I'm practically a kid.

358
00:33:38.896 --> 00:33:42.810
Look, pull yourself together.
All you need is an upgrade.

359
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.029
That new-upgrade smell.

360
00:33:47.238 --> 00:33:49.811
Just came in, fully loaded. Look.

361
00:33:50.032 --> 00:33:52.025
It's got cup-holders, standard.

362
00:33:52.243 --> 00:33:53.654
Does it come in plus sizes?

363
00:33:53.828 --> 00:33:58.490
Sure, take a look at the new
Bigweld spring collection.

364
00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:04.414
I can't afford that fancy stuff.
All I need is one stinking neck joint.

365
00:34:04.588 --> 00:34:07.874
No. Why did this happen to me?

366
00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:12.884
I'm hurting me. Idiot.

367
00:34:13.097 --> 00:34:16.596
Sorry, pal, it's either upgrade
or the chop shop for you.

368
00:34:16.809 --> 00:34:18.517
The chop shop?

369
00:34:19.312 --> 00:34:22.431
I'm fine, I'm fine. Look, no hands.

370
00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:28.809
Ta-da! I'm back. Miss me?

371
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.734
- No one's going to the chop shop.
- That's right.

372
00:34:31.907 --> 00:34:33.817
What do you think
we can get for him?

373
00:34:33.993 --> 00:34:36.448
Will you stop? Listen, shiny pants...

374
00:34:36.662 --> 00:34:39.153
...you get back there
and find a part for my brother.

375
00:34:39.332 --> 00:34:43.828
We are not junk, we are not scrap,
and we will not be treated this way.

376
00:34:45.713 --> 00:34:47.504
I'm sorry. I don't have the parts.

377
00:34:47.673 --> 00:34:50.758
Well, do you have two washers,
an S-spring and some Fastweld?

378
00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:52.421
I can fix you easy.

379
00:34:54.805 --> 00:34:57.972
The Force is strong with this one.

380
00:35:09.236 --> 00:35:10.944
When was the last time
you got oiled?

381
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.569
I can't answer that
with my kid sister here.

382
00:35:13.741 --> 00:35:15.069
Can it, Fender.

383
00:35:15.284 --> 00:35:17.656
Hold still. This might tickle.

384
00:35:17.828 --> 00:35:19.786
We haven't been properly introduced.

385
00:35:19.997 --> 00:35:21.954
I'm Fender. Used to be Bumper...

386
00:35:22.124 --> 00:35:24.615
...but had to change it
when we came in to the country.

387
00:35:24.794 --> 00:35:26.454
Copperbottom, Rodney Copperbottom.

388
00:35:26.671 --> 00:35:29.755
Riddle me this:
Why did I meet you among the garbage?

389
00:35:29.966 --> 00:35:32.503
Well, today I tried
to get in to see Bigweld.

390
00:35:33.552 --> 00:35:37.420
Well, if you find him, tell him
we really need him to come back.

391
00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.348
He cared about bots like us.

392
00:35:39.558 --> 00:35:42.762
I heard they've done him in
and left the rest of us to fall apart.

393
00:35:43.437 --> 00:35:45.644
Well, that ought to do it.

394
00:35:45.815 --> 00:35:49.480
Look at that! And he fixed my neck.

395
00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:51.561
- Sweeper!
- Sweeper?

396
00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:54.272
Make yourself scarce.

397
00:36:00.454 --> 00:36:01.735
What's the big deal?

398
00:36:01.914 --> 00:36:05.782
- Well, if you're an outmode like Fender...
- Hey.

399
00:36:06.002 --> 00:36:08.290
They sweep you up
and take you to the chop shop.

400
00:36:08.462 --> 00:36:13.089
Where they melt you down
and turn you into something else.

401
00:36:13.259 --> 00:36:15.050
You mean...?

402
00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.250
Yep.

403
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.805
Sweepers. Sweepers.

404
00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:22.718
Help. Here's one outmode
you're not gonna get.

405
00:36:30.318 --> 00:36:32.227
Fender, run!

406
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.944
That was close.

407
00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:42.657
When in Robot City,
guests of the Rusties... That's us.

408
00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.582
- Stay at Aunt Fanny's boarding house,
where our motto is:

409
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.205
"Beats rusting outside."

410
00:36:48.586 --> 00:36:52.630
Let me just let her know you're here.
Aunt Fanny!

411
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.413
- We brought someone.
- I'm in the kitchen.

412
00:36:55.593 --> 00:36:58.629
- Are you sure your aunt won't mind?
- Relax, she's not my aunt.

413
00:36:58.804 --> 00:37:02.754
She just takes in bots who are broke.
Bless her little heart.

414
00:37:02.975 --> 00:37:05.015
Well, then why is she called
Aunt Fanny?

415
00:37:05.186 --> 00:37:06.810
We couldn't call her Aunt Booty.

416
00:37:10.524 --> 00:37:12.019
Oh, crap.

417
00:37:12.193 --> 00:37:13.853
She's a little artsy-fartsy.

418
00:37:14.028 --> 00:37:16.982
The artsy's okay,
but when she gets fartsy...

419
00:37:17.156 --> 00:37:19.729
Look at... Oh, right on my shoes.

420
00:37:19.909 --> 00:37:21.451
I'm so clumsy.

421
00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:24.703
Well, hello there. What's your name?

422
00:37:24.914 --> 00:37:26.159
I'm Rodney Bigbottom...

423
00:37:26.332 --> 00:37:29.416
No, I'm Rodney Copperbottom.
Copperbottom.

424
00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:33.246
That's a wonderful name, Bigbottom.

425
00:37:35.466 --> 00:37:36.960
Well, I just...

426
00:37:37.134 --> 00:37:39.922
- What happened to your friend?
- He's been rear-ended.

427
00:37:41.931 --> 00:37:44.054
Oh, there you are.

428
00:37:45.101 --> 00:37:47.770
Aunt Fanny, he needs a place to stay.

429
00:37:47.937 --> 00:37:50.558
Well, just make yourself at home.

430
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:52.771
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

431
00:37:52.942 --> 00:37:54.353
My pleasure.

432
00:37:54.652 --> 00:37:56.229
See a need, fill a need.

433
00:37:56.445 --> 00:37:58.023
Hey, just like Bigweld.

434
00:37:58.239 --> 00:38:01.359
Bigweld. That's a lot of robot.

435
00:38:04.245 --> 00:38:06.368
Come on. You can bunk with me.

436
00:38:06.539 --> 00:38:08.412
We'll ignore the gossip.

437
00:38:14.797 --> 00:38:16.624
You missed a spot.

438
00:38:16.841 --> 00:38:18.917
Fender, get out of my room!

439
00:38:19.135 --> 00:38:20.463
I'm not in your room.

440
00:38:20.636 --> 00:38:22.843
I am now. Now I'm not.
I am. Not. Am...

441
00:38:23.014 --> 00:38:25.006
Get out of my room.

442
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.643
Oh, man, this is my third oil change
today. Something's wrong with me.

443
00:38:32.648 --> 00:38:34.059
Sorry.

444
00:38:35.026 --> 00:38:38.062
Here we are. Home sweet home.

445
00:38:38.237 --> 00:38:40.609
What's mine is yours.

446
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:42.359
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get them.

447
00:38:42.533 --> 00:38:44.442
Look at that.
Now they're arm-wrestling.

448
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.329
Could you separate them?
Hurry, my backside itches.

449
00:39:15.608 --> 00:39:19.606
I know that sounds bad,
but I'm just doing musical arm farts.

450
00:39:21.489 --> 00:39:22.864
You know how to do those?

451
00:39:23.074 --> 00:39:26.443
They're hard to do, because we're metal,
but that's where the skill comes in.

452
00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:28.410
I'm real close. Listen.

453
00:39:28.579 --> 00:39:30.204
No, wait.

454
00:39:30.373 --> 00:39:32.164
No, wait, wait.

455
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.167
You can't tell me that didn't sound like a...
Like an old man.

456
00:39:37.254 --> 00:39:40.588
You know, I'm a little tired.
Maybe tomorrow.

457
00:39:40.758 --> 00:39:42.834
Kind of a rough day, huh?

458
00:39:43.052 --> 00:39:45.721
Kind of. My dad's probably
sitting by the phone...

459
00:39:45.888 --> 00:39:47.928
...waiting for his brilliant son
to call...

460
00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:51.515
...and tell him what a big success
my first day was.

461
00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:53.478
I know it's not your problem.

462
00:39:53.646 --> 00:39:56.018
If you burden your friends,
you won't have any.

463
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.850
What are you, a fortune cookie?

464
00:39:58.025 --> 00:40:00.730
"That's what friends..."

465
00:40:01.028 --> 00:40:02.357
You consider me a friend?

466
00:40:02.571 --> 00:40:04.481
Sure, what else would I consider you?

467
00:40:04.657 --> 00:40:07.362
An embarrassment,
a way to rebel against your parents...

468
00:40:07.535 --> 00:40:09.860
...a desperate cry for help.
The list is endless.

469
00:40:10.204 --> 00:40:11.746
Let's just stick with friend.

470
00:40:11.914 --> 00:40:14.832
You know, even though you had
a discouraging day, remember...

471
00:40:15.001 --> 00:40:16.874
...there's another one
coming tomorrow.

472
00:40:17.044 --> 00:40:19.879
You know, my last roommate
jumped out that window.

473
00:40:20.548 --> 00:40:22.540
Hey, Fender.

474
00:40:24.677 --> 00:40:27.797
Yeah, baby. Let it rip!

475
00:40:31.767 --> 00:40:33.677
Guys, come on,
what are you, 3 years old?

476
00:40:33.853 --> 00:40:35.845
This is how a man does it.

477
00:40:36.022 --> 00:40:38.098
You guys are so gross.

478
00:40:38.274 --> 00:40:41.310
Besides, this is how you do it.

479
00:40:41.902 --> 00:40:44.654
Hey, kids, get a load of this.

480
00:40:49.243 --> 00:40:51.152
Aunt Fanny...

481
00:40:51.329 --> 00:40:53.405
...we were using our arms.

482
00:40:53.581 --> 00:40:56.202
Oh, excuse me.

483
00:40:56.375 --> 00:40:59.246
Lady, please...

484
00:40:59.712 --> 00:41:01.918
...see a doctor.

485
00:41:13.476 --> 00:41:14.934
Breakfast.

486
00:41:15.144 --> 00:41:16.603
This will perk everyone up.

487
00:41:16.771 --> 00:41:19.096
Some of Aunt Fanny's
fresh-brewed grease.

488
00:41:19.273 --> 00:41:20.648
Yummy!

489
00:41:20.858 --> 00:41:23.266
Careful, it's hot.

490
00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:31.901
So, what are you guys doing today?

491
00:41:32.495 --> 00:41:34.653
- We're doing it.
- What about you?

492
00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.788
Bigweld's disappeared,
and you're sitting here.

493
00:41:36.957 --> 00:41:38.701
That's already been established.

494
00:41:38.918 --> 00:41:42.038
- I gotta find out what happened to him.
- Hey, you want my advice?

495
00:41:42.213 --> 00:41:44.040
- Sure.
- Forget it.

496
00:41:44.215 --> 00:41:47.750
"Never try, never fail."
Those are the words I live by.

497
00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:51.005
Crank, the idol of millions is gone,
and no one seems to care.

498
00:41:51.222 --> 00:41:53.511
There should be an angry mob
out there.

499
00:41:53.683 --> 00:41:55.260
What the...?

500
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:00.513
Wow, that was great, psychic friend.

501
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.141
Now say, "Money should be
falling from the sky."

502
00:42:04.318 --> 00:42:06.809
Say it. Say it.

503
00:42:08.656 --> 00:42:10.898
Sorry, folks, all sold out.

504
00:42:11.075 --> 00:42:13.400
Nothing but upgrades from here on in.

505
00:42:13.577 --> 00:42:16.329
But I like myself just the way I am.

506
00:42:16.497 --> 00:42:18.988
- We can't afford upgrades!
- Let's get him!

507
00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:22.203
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Don't throw me.

508
00:42:23.129 --> 00:42:25.205
Isn't that the guy
that fixed Fender's neck?

509
00:42:25.381 --> 00:42:27.041
Yeah, that guy fixes bots.

510
00:42:27.216 --> 00:42:29.043
Yeah, that kid can help you.

511
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.466
Brace yourself.
You're about to get popular.

512
00:42:32.722 --> 00:42:34.430
Only those with insurance.

513
00:42:34.598 --> 00:42:37.599
Oh, I forgot. Everybody, come on.

514
00:42:38.144 --> 00:42:40.432
Parts, man. I need parts.

515
00:42:40.604 --> 00:42:43.356
You don't look that... bad.

516
00:42:44.734 --> 00:42:47.106
- Hey, everybody, spare parts!
- Yeah!

517
00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.523
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's wrong with you robots?

518
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.946
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

519
00:42:53.117 --> 00:42:54.611
Why do you have two noses?

520
00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:57.905
One's for showing, one's for blowing.

521
00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.449
- Sorry.
- Hey, could you look at my arm?

522
00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:04.076
- Nice grip.
- Like iron.

523
00:43:04.295 --> 00:43:07.415
- I can't get rid of this spare tire.
- I am losing my mind.

524
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.584
Back off, back off.

525
00:43:09.759 --> 00:43:12.463
He's got his own dreams
that won't come true.

526
00:43:17.725 --> 00:43:20.560
See a need, fill a need.

527
00:43:20.936 --> 00:43:22.514
Wait.

528
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:25.354
Who wants to get fixed?

529
00:44:07.817 --> 00:44:10.818
Thanks, Rodney. You're number one.

530
00:44:27.253 --> 00:44:30.669
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

531
00:44:39.724 --> 00:44:41.467
Oh, yeah.

532
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:44.887
I have never felt so relaxed.

533
00:44:45.062 --> 00:44:49.392
Say, do you mind giving me a little
scratch between the shoulder blades?

534
00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:52.610
There you... Easy, tiger.

535
00:44:52.778 --> 00:44:54.438
Hey! Take it easy.

536
00:44:54.613 --> 00:44:56.986
Hey, what are you trying to do,
kill me?

537
00:44:57.158 --> 00:44:59.862
Relax. It's me, your mommy.

538
00:45:00.036 --> 00:45:02.823
- How did you get in here?
- I came up the air shaft.

539
00:45:02.997 --> 00:45:05.666
I know you don't like
anybody here to see me.

540
00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:08.668
- Well, what do you want?
- Someone's fixing them.

541
00:45:08.878 --> 00:45:11.914
- What?
- Someone is repairing outmodes...

542
00:45:12.089 --> 00:45:14.759
...and they are laughing at you.
- Who?

543
00:45:14.925 --> 00:45:17.416
And are you sure they're not
laughing with me?

544
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:19.173
Yes.

545
00:45:19.347 --> 00:45:23.214
So what if one crazy fanatic repairs
a few outmodes? Who cares?

546
00:45:23.392 --> 00:45:26.975
Think. Use those brains
I stole for you. Today, it's one.

547
00:45:27.146 --> 00:45:30.147
What about tomorrow, when
everybody gets the idea this is okay?

548
00:45:30.316 --> 00:45:33.103
"We can fix ourselves.
We don't need upgrades.

549
00:45:33.277 --> 00:45:34.688
We want Bigweld."

550
00:45:34.862 --> 00:45:36.855
Then what happens to you?

551
00:45:37.073 --> 00:45:38.982
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

552
00:45:39.158 --> 00:45:42.159
We've got to find out
who this is and stop him.

553
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:46.070
Not stop him, crush him, destroy him.

554
00:45:46.248 --> 00:45:50.495
And by the way, I brought you
a little something for your desk.

555
00:45:58.219 --> 00:46:01.173
- Is there anyone else waiting?
- Let me look.

556
00:46:03.182 --> 00:46:05.340
- A few.
- "A few"?

557
00:46:05.518 --> 00:46:08.638
What did you expect, Rodney?
Bigweld was gone.

558
00:46:08.813 --> 00:46:13.475
Sweepers were on the loose,
but then came Copperbottom.

559
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:16.142
I'm getting all static-y
just thinking about it.

560
00:46:16.362 --> 00:46:19.149
I'm not Bigweld.
These robots need parts.

561
00:46:19.323 --> 00:46:22.028
Mail call. Mail call.

562
00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:24.573
Copperbottom,
this one's from your mom.

563
00:46:24.745 --> 00:46:26.821
Oh, is there anything for me?

564
00:46:26.998 --> 00:46:29.749
Oh, I got something for you.

565
00:46:29.917 --> 00:46:31.661
That's from my sister.

566
00:46:31.836 --> 00:46:33.330
I recognize the handwriting.

567
00:46:33.963 --> 00:46:35.623
Is anything wrong?

568
00:46:35.798 --> 00:46:39.249
I'll say. His father's got
one foot in the junkyard...

569
00:46:39.427 --> 00:46:43.092
...and if they can't find new parts
for him, he's only got a few miles left.

570
00:46:43.597 --> 00:46:46.349
Rodney, are you really worried
about your dad?

571
00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:48.136
Do you wanna go home?

572
00:46:48.352 --> 00:46:50.345
Well, if I go home,
I still can't help him.

573
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:53.094
We're out of parts.
We've gotta get to Bigweld.

574
00:46:53.274 --> 00:46:56.358
He's the only one that can fix this.

575
00:46:58.529 --> 00:47:01.815
He's trying to tell us something.
What is it, boy? What's wrong?

576
00:47:02.325 --> 00:47:05.325
Bigweld is going...

577
00:47:05.494 --> 00:47:06.823
...dancing.

578
00:47:06.996 --> 00:47:10.032
Of course, the Bigweld Ball.

579
00:47:10.333 --> 00:47:13.168
You can't have the Bigweld Ball
without Bigweld.

580
00:47:13.377 --> 00:47:16.047
Well, that's it, then.
I'm going to the Bigweld Ball.

581
00:47:16.213 --> 00:47:18.372
What? That's the fanciest party
of the year.

582
00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:20.209
You'll never get past the gate.

583
00:47:31.145 --> 00:47:34.181
- Can I help you?
- I think maybe you can.

584
00:47:34.357 --> 00:47:37.560
This is Count Roderick
von Brokenzipper.

585
00:47:37.735 --> 00:47:39.774
Formerly Count Velcro.

586
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.322
Where are the trumpets?

587
00:47:42.531 --> 00:47:45.319
We were promised trumpets
to announce the count's arrival.

588
00:47:45.493 --> 00:47:48.743
Sorry, Your Grace.
Beat me until you're happy.

589
00:47:48.913 --> 00:47:52.329
He's happy. And I'm not feeling
too bad myself.

590
00:47:52.917 --> 00:47:56.368
- Let me... You're not on the list.
- We're what?

591
00:47:56.545 --> 00:47:58.455
Once again.

592
00:47:59.048 --> 00:48:02.298
Thank you. Fine, we will go.

593
00:48:02.468 --> 00:48:04.128
You'll explain to your superiors...

594
00:48:04.303 --> 00:48:08.597
...why we were not able to attend your
little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.

595
00:48:08.808 --> 00:48:10.884
But we're leaving in a huff.

596
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.812
No, no. No. Please, go right in.

597
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.016
In fact, would the count
like to hit me?

598
00:48:17.233 --> 00:48:20.234
The count hit you?
The arrogance of some people.

599
00:48:20.403 --> 00:48:23.357
I will hit you on his behalf.

600
00:48:24.323 --> 00:48:25.817
Thank you, Your Grace.

601
00:48:28.828 --> 00:48:30.370
Okay, let's split up.

602
00:48:30.538 --> 00:48:33.373
If you see Bigweld, come and find me.

603
00:48:33.833 --> 00:48:36.371
If anything goes wrong,
we'll signal each other.

604
00:48:36.544 --> 00:48:40.126
What kind of signal do you want?
You want something kind of subtle, like:

605
00:48:41.173 --> 00:48:42.549
Or:

606
00:48:43.759 --> 00:48:45.253
Oh, how about this:

607
00:48:50.266 --> 00:48:53.551
Ricola!

608
00:48:53.936 --> 00:48:56.308
Subtle. Let's get to work.

609
00:48:56.814 --> 00:48:59.566
A screwdriver, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

610
00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:01.192
Yes, sir.

611
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.079
I'll have what he's having.

612
00:49:22.465 --> 00:49:26.593
You know, Cappy, it's nice that you
can see me like this, away from work.

613
00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:30.841
See my more casual, fun-loving side.

614
00:49:34.143 --> 00:49:36.551
Now, where were we?

615
00:49:36.771 --> 00:49:40.187
Well, there are never any
interesting men at these parties.

616
00:49:40.358 --> 00:49:43.394
Hello, ladies.
Fender von Fender at your service.

617
00:49:43.736 --> 00:49:46.025
Hi, I'm Loretta...

618
00:49:46.197 --> 00:49:47.477
...Geargrinder.

619
00:49:47.657 --> 00:49:52.153
Anyone dressed as badly as you are
must be an eccentric billionaire.

620
00:49:53.746 --> 00:49:56.617
Ladies and gentlebots,
now coming to the stage...

621
00:49:56.791 --> 00:49:58.867
...the top bot, the big bolt...

622
00:49:59.043 --> 00:50:02.791
...who's your daddy?
Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.

623
00:50:03.047 --> 00:50:06.214
Thank you. We now come
to the point of the evening...

624
00:50:06.384 --> 00:50:09.799
...where I have the tremendous honor
of introducing...

625
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:13.137
- Excuse me. Sorry.
...our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...

626
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:15.887
...who, unfortunately,
is unable to attend.

627
00:50:17.103 --> 00:50:19.772
- What?
- He sends his apologies...

628
00:50:19.939 --> 00:50:22.512
...his love and a small box
of assorted cookies.

629
00:50:22.733 --> 00:50:25.734
- Not coming?
- And what are you doing here?

630
00:50:25.903 --> 00:50:27.647
What have you done with Bigweld?

631
00:50:29.657 --> 00:50:31.899
How come we don't see him
anymore, huh?

632
00:50:32.118 --> 00:50:35.237
Okay. Security,
we have a party-crasher.

633
00:50:35.413 --> 00:50:39.660
Yeah, that's right, and I had to put
all this junk on in order to get in here...

634
00:50:39.834 --> 00:50:44.163
...so that I could tell Bigweld
that you are outmoding millions of bots.

635
00:50:44.714 --> 00:50:47.584
And I know because
I spend all day fixing them.

636
00:50:48.009 --> 00:50:49.289
You.

637
00:51:09.613 --> 00:51:13.065
Oh, my darling, that is the cry
of the deep-doo-doo bird.

638
00:51:13.242 --> 00:51:15.116
I must fly.

639
00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:17.990
Take him for a drive...

640
00:51:18.164 --> 00:51:22.161
...and bring me back
his exact weight in paper clips.

641
00:51:23.586 --> 00:51:25.828
- No!
- No?

642
00:51:26.756 --> 00:51:28.582
I'll escort him out.

643
00:51:29.008 --> 00:51:31.713
You don't wanna look bad
in front of your people, do you?

644
00:51:31.886 --> 00:51:33.380
- Good point.
- When I get back...

645
00:51:33.554 --> 00:51:35.630
...I'll show you my casual,
fun-loving side.

646
00:51:35.806 --> 00:51:37.466
Oh, you.

647
00:51:37.683 --> 00:51:39.925
- Get moving.
- What? What are you doing?

648
00:51:40.102 --> 00:51:42.011
Saving your life.

649
00:51:42.897 --> 00:51:44.806
- Come on.
- Let him go.

650
00:51:44.982 --> 00:51:46.642
Let him go. Let him go.

651
00:51:46.817 --> 00:51:49.024
- Get out of here, you idiot.
- Get him!

652
00:51:49.236 --> 00:51:51.028
- Fender, let's go.
- You know him?

653
00:51:51.197 --> 00:51:52.857
Fender, wait for me.

654
00:51:53.366 --> 00:51:55.074
Wonderbot.

655
00:51:57.078 --> 00:51:58.869
Get out of my way!

656
00:52:00.122 --> 00:52:02.198
Hey, Tim,
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

657
00:52:02.416 --> 00:52:04.456
Oh, you again.

658
00:52:08.214 --> 00:52:09.874
Oh, that was amazing.

659
00:52:10.049 --> 00:52:13.465
- So where do we go now?
- I'm taking you to the train station.

660
00:52:13.678 --> 00:52:16.881
- What? No way.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

661
00:52:17.056 --> 00:52:19.381
Ratchet will use your head
for a hood ornament.

662
00:52:19.558 --> 00:52:22.049
I'm not leaving until I find Bigweld.

663
00:52:22.228 --> 00:52:24.101
- That's not...
- Can't you take me to him?

664
00:52:26.524 --> 00:52:28.730
I must be out of my mind.

665
00:52:39.412 --> 00:52:41.700
<i>Au réservoir</i>, my darling.

666
00:52:42.873 --> 00:52:46.289
- Thanks for walking me home.
- Thanks for carrying me up that hill.

667
00:52:46.502 --> 00:52:49.538
- Until tomorrow?
- I shall count the seconds.

668
00:52:49.964 --> 00:52:51.921
So far, I'm up to four.

669
00:52:52.925 --> 00:52:55.131
You crazy nut boy.

670
00:52:55.344 --> 00:52:57.551
Crazy about you.

671
00:53:09.817 --> 00:53:13.518
<i>I'm singing in the oil.</i>

672
00:53:13.696 --> 00:53:16.981
<i>I'm singing in the oil.</i>

673
00:53:17.158 --> 00:53:19.993
<i>After all that work and toil.</i>

674
00:53:20.161 --> 00:53:24.028
<i>I'm just slipping in the oil.</i>

675
00:53:24.206 --> 00:53:27.575
<i>I know where I've been sent.</i>

676
00:53:27.752 --> 00:53:31.203
<i>I'm covered in lubricant.</i>

677
00:53:31.422 --> 00:53:33.461
My life has turned around.

678
00:53:33.632 --> 00:53:37.582
From now on, I'm a winner!

679
00:53:38.012 --> 00:53:40.966
Stop, you've made a mistake.
I'm alive. You can't do this.

680
00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.634
Help.

681
00:53:51.567 --> 00:53:53.524
Okay, we tried. Let's get out of here.

682
00:53:53.694 --> 00:53:55.236
No, no, no. Something's up.

683
00:53:55.404 --> 00:53:57.397
Look at all these newspapers
and this mail.

684
00:53:57.573 --> 00:54:00.408
Come on. They probably
stopped delivering these years ago.

685
00:54:00.576 --> 00:54:02.201
Paper.

686
00:54:04.121 --> 00:54:06.078
Late edition.

687
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:09.291
- You say something?
- Nice one of you.

688
00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.295
Come on.
We gotta get you out of here.

689
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:23.255
Big, creaky door.

690
00:54:23.432 --> 00:54:24.595
Perfect.

691
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:51.994
Look at this.

692
00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:54.245
This is Bigweld's actual workshop.

693
00:54:54.422 --> 00:54:56.414
I recognize it from his old TV show.

694
00:54:56.590 --> 00:55:00.125
Could you keep it down?
We're not supposed to be here.

695
00:55:02.304 --> 00:55:03.763
Do you know what these are?

696
00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:06.636
These are Bigweld's
original invention designs.

697
00:55:06.809 --> 00:55:09.893
- That's his own writing.
- This is strange.

698
00:55:10.062 --> 00:55:12.387
How come it just stops in the middle?

699
00:55:12.565 --> 00:55:14.604
Look at this.

700
00:55:14.775 --> 00:55:18.393
Remember, he used to have
these on his show?

701
00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:20.943
Rodney, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

702
00:55:21.115 --> 00:55:23.238
Why are they so dusty?

703
00:55:23.409 --> 00:55:25.318
Wait, don't.

704
00:55:51.354 --> 00:55:54.308
This is much more elaborate
than the ones on his show.

705
00:56:29.975 --> 00:56:31.635
Rodney, what do we do?

706
00:56:31.811 --> 00:56:35.476
I don't know.
This is kind of a first for me.

707
00:56:41.278 --> 00:56:43.900
- Yeah!
- It's him.

708
00:56:53.374 --> 00:56:56.291
- Who's the king of the beach?
- Are you all right?

709
00:56:56.502 --> 00:57:00.582
Well, considering I'm an old fat guy
who just crashed to the floor...

710
00:57:00.756 --> 00:57:03.508
...I'm fantastic.
Now, who the heck are you?

711
00:57:03.676 --> 00:57:04.956
I'm Rodney.

712
00:57:05.136 --> 00:57:08.090
Oh, I thought you were
the dominoes delivery boy.

713
00:57:08.305 --> 00:57:11.093
Come on, let's set them up again,
only bigger.

714
00:57:11.308 --> 00:57:14.226
Sir, is this what you've
been working on?

715
00:57:14.437 --> 00:57:17.307
This is why no one sees you?

716
00:57:17.898 --> 00:57:20.734
Young man,
nobody likes a chatterbox.

717
00:57:20.943 --> 00:57:22.936
But there's a terrible crisis,
Mr. Bigweld.

718
00:57:23.237 --> 00:57:25.443
We need to talk.

719
00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:30.737
Son, I've gotta tell you,
you're making a lousy first impression.

720
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:35.241
Please, sir, he is your biggest fan.
In fact, he's an inventor just like you.

721
00:57:35.416 --> 00:57:37.455
- Well...
- Show him that thing you made.

722
00:57:37.793 --> 00:57:39.952
A device? A doohickey?
A thingamajig?

723
00:57:41.922 --> 00:57:45.872
Now, don't be scared.
Show Mr. Bigweld what you can do.

724
00:57:46.052 --> 00:57:48.340
Go on. It's okay.

725
00:57:51.682 --> 00:57:55.098
Is that what it's supposed to do?

726
00:57:56.812 --> 00:57:58.390
It gets nervous under pressure...

727
00:57:58.606 --> 00:58:01.144
Son, let me give you
a good piece of advice.

728
00:58:01.317 --> 00:58:03.191
- Yes?
- Give up.

729
00:58:03.361 --> 00:58:06.030
What? You're telling me to quit?

730
00:58:06.238 --> 00:58:09.442
I said "give up,"
but "quit" works just as good.

731
00:58:11.535 --> 00:58:13.575
Is that what you did?
Is that why you're sitting here...

732
00:58:13.746 --> 00:58:16.996
...letting Ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes?

733
00:58:17.166 --> 00:58:20.084
Kid, sometimes you just gotta know
when you're licked.

734
00:58:20.252 --> 00:58:23.787
But you're Bigweld.
You can fix anything.

735
00:58:23.964 --> 00:58:25.459
I used to think so.

736
00:58:25.675 --> 00:58:28.960
To me, having the company
was all about making life better.

737
00:58:29.178 --> 00:58:32.262
With Ratchet, it was making money
that came first.

738
00:58:32.431 --> 00:58:36.559
I became old-fashioned, an outmode.

739
00:58:36.936 --> 00:58:40.519
Go home, kid.
If he beat me, he's gonna beat you.

740
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:44.023
The world you're looking for
no longer exists. You missed it.

741
00:58:44.193 --> 00:58:46.020
Find some other foolish dream.

742
00:58:46.237 --> 00:58:48.906
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very, very...

743
00:58:49.073 --> 00:58:51.990
...very busy.

744
00:58:53.035 --> 00:58:54.827
Yeah, I can see that.

745
00:58:56.956 --> 00:59:00.325
All I ever wanted
was to grow up to be like him.

746
00:59:11.554 --> 00:59:13.511
Help. Open the door.

747
00:59:13.681 --> 00:59:15.757
Open the door.

748
00:59:17.393 --> 00:59:19.302
Close the door. Close the door!

749
00:59:29.405 --> 00:59:32.240
Wow, look at all these parts.
It's a smorgasbord.

750
00:59:32.408 --> 00:59:35.362
Look at that. So many things
I've wanted all my life.

751
00:59:35.578 --> 00:59:37.037
Oh, that's pretty.

752
00:59:54.305 --> 00:59:56.594
Okay, Mother, this way.

753
00:59:56.807 --> 00:59:58.764
Let me look, please. I can't bear it.

754
00:59:59.185 --> 01:00:01.391
No peeking, now. It's a surprise.

755
01:00:01.604 --> 01:00:02.932
Oh, you are a wicked boy.

756
01:00:03.105 --> 01:00:04.564
And look.

757
01:00:05.232 --> 01:00:08.020
- For me?
- It's got a full tank of gas.

758
01:00:08.194 --> 01:00:10.186
If you're ready to mow,
she's ready to go.

759
01:00:10.363 --> 01:00:13.447
Has any mother ever had a better son?

760
01:00:13.616 --> 01:00:16.321
By the way, I found out
who's been fixing those outmodes.

761
01:00:16.494 --> 01:00:17.952
So tomorrow, these babies...

762
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.694
...are gonna chop him up
along with all his buddies...

763
01:00:20.873 --> 01:00:24.242
...and every other walking pile of junk
I'm sick of looking at.

764
01:00:25.836 --> 01:00:27.247
What's that?

765
01:00:57.743 --> 01:00:59.902
This is so wrong. This is so wrong.

766
01:01:00.496 --> 01:01:03.201
Help. Help!

767
01:01:11.007 --> 01:01:13.414
Rivet Town, please. One-way.

768
01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:19.294
Hi, Mom.

769
01:01:19.473 --> 01:01:22.677
Oh, I'm doing fine. How are you?

770
01:01:22.852 --> 01:01:26.636
- <i>And Dad?</i>
- He's right here. I'll put him on.

771
01:01:26.814 --> 01:01:29.352
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

772
01:01:29.567 --> 01:01:31.394
Hey, Dad. How are you feeling?

773
01:01:31.569 --> 01:01:34.819
Oh, fine, fine. I...

774
01:01:35.781 --> 01:01:37.857
I've just been a little
under the weather.

775
01:01:38.034 --> 01:01:40.073
No, we're just having a little trouble...

776
01:01:40.244 --> 01:01:43.328
...finding your old man
a replacement part, that's all.

777
01:01:43.539 --> 01:01:46.291
But let's talk about you.
What kind of work are you doing?

778
01:01:46.459 --> 01:01:48.250
What's Bigweld like?
Did you meet him?

779
01:01:48.627 --> 01:01:51.249
Yeah, I met him, but...

780
01:01:52.298 --> 01:01:53.757
What's wrong, son?

781
01:01:53.966 --> 01:01:57.465
It's not how we thought it was, Dad.

782
01:01:57.636 --> 01:02:00.472
It's not... I can't...

783
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:02.766
I see.

784
01:02:02.975 --> 01:02:05.264
- I'm really sorry I let you down.
- No, no, no.

785
01:02:05.436 --> 01:02:08.223
You could never let me down, Rodney.

786
01:02:10.775 --> 01:02:13.645
Listen, I know it isn't easy, Rodney...

787
01:02:13.819 --> 01:02:16.357
...but a dream
that you don't fight for...

788
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:20.113
...can haunt you
for the rest of your life.

789
01:02:21.619 --> 01:02:22.994
Yeah, Dad.

790
01:02:23.162 --> 01:02:25.404
<i>It's up to you, son</i>.

791
01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:32.245
- Your father loves you very much.
- I know.

792
01:02:32.421 --> 01:02:36.371
With our Friends and Family plan, you
can talk to him 500 minutes a month.

793
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.128
Free nights and weekends.

794
01:02:38.302 --> 01:02:40.710
Yoo-hoo, Rodney!

795
01:02:40.888 --> 01:02:42.548
Wait.

796
01:02:43.391 --> 01:02:46.345
- Your suitcase.
- Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I'm...

797
01:02:46.519 --> 01:02:49.140
The others wanted to come
and see you off too.

798
01:02:49.313 --> 01:02:50.772
Well, why didn't they?

799
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:53.857
Oh, they did.

800
01:02:56.028 --> 01:02:57.439
Next time, let's split a cab.

801
01:03:00.199 --> 01:03:02.239
Who the heck is she?

802
01:03:02.451 --> 01:03:05.488
I used to have a figure like that.

803
01:03:05.663 --> 01:03:07.952
Hurry, come on.
One ticket to anywhere.

804
01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:09.833
Fender?

805
01:03:10.001 --> 01:03:11.792
I have a sister.

806
01:03:12.378 --> 01:03:14.252
An ugly sister.

807
01:03:14.463 --> 01:03:17.133
Hey, guess what. It's the sweepers.

808
01:03:17.299 --> 01:03:20.882
They're rounding up outmodes
and taking them... What "them"? Us.

809
01:03:21.053 --> 01:03:22.880
- To Madame Gasket's chop shop.

810
01:03:23.055 --> 01:03:25.807
- And guess who's really behind it all.
- Ratchet.

811
01:03:26.017 --> 01:03:28.508
You don't wanna guess?
I ran all this way in heels.

812
01:03:28.686 --> 01:03:30.228
- Come on, take a stab.
- Ratchet.

813
01:03:30.438 --> 01:03:33.392
Ratchet! Listen to me. Listen to me.

814
01:03:33.566 --> 01:03:37.231
- We won't last a week.
- Okay, okay. Settle down. I got a plan.

815
01:03:37.403 --> 01:03:39.775
- Let's all get on that train.
- Come on.

816
01:03:39.989 --> 01:03:42.527
Hey, wait a minute.
You're all giving up?

817
01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.692
- You started it.
- Well, I'm ending it.

818
01:03:44.869 --> 01:03:47.739
My mistake was hoping that Bigweld
would fight our battles.

819
01:03:47.913 --> 01:03:49.989
Well, he won't. It's up to us.

820
01:03:50.207 --> 01:03:52.877
If we don't do something
about Ratchet, no one will.

821
01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:54.793
Come on, let's fight back.

822
01:03:55.004 --> 01:03:56.961
Fighting never solved anything.

823
01:03:57.173 --> 01:03:59.794
Quitting isn't so productive either.
I gotta tell you.

824
01:04:00.009 --> 01:04:01.918
It's the big boy.

825
01:04:02.136 --> 01:04:04.176
Oh, be still, my pump.

826
01:04:04.388 --> 01:04:07.175
Kid, if you're gonna fight,
I'm going in with you.

827
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.725
You... You are?

828
01:04:08.893 --> 01:04:12.013
Hey, who's the dame
with the sweet keister?

829
01:04:12.188 --> 01:04:13.682
- But why?
- I don't know.

830
01:04:13.856 --> 01:04:15.932
I'm a big guy,
and I like women with large...

831
01:04:16.108 --> 01:04:18.730
No, no, no.
Why are you gonna help us?

832
01:04:18.903 --> 01:04:22.236
Because I wanna grow up
to be like you.

833
01:04:26.369 --> 01:04:27.911
Then let's do it.

834
01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:33.281
Come on, gang. Let's give
that Ratchet an old-school fix-it!

835
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:37.877
Oh, what a man.

836
01:04:38.923 --> 01:04:40.085
Someone get a crane.

837
01:04:47.682 --> 01:04:49.389
Mother, I'm an adult, okay?

838
01:04:49.558 --> 01:04:52.643
So stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.
I'm doing it today...

839
01:04:52.812 --> 01:04:56.975
...how I want, where I want
and with whatever I want.

840
01:05:01.028 --> 01:05:03.946
Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes.
I want you both there.

841
01:05:04.115 --> 01:05:06.570
Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?

842
01:05:06.784 --> 01:05:08.907
No, no. You stay here...

843
01:05:09.078 --> 01:05:12.114
...and watch Daddy's limo.
- Yes, sir.

844
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:14.158
I'm going inside to kick some booty.

845
01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:16.540
Hey, you know,
your boyfriend here is a genius.

846
01:05:16.752 --> 01:05:18.377
- What?
- Oh, he's not my... He is?

847
01:05:18.546 --> 01:05:20.254
I am?

848
01:05:21.257 --> 01:05:23.712
Thanks for still believing in me.

849
01:05:24.885 --> 01:05:28.089
It's good to be home. Toodley-oodley!

850
01:05:36.939 --> 01:05:40.308
I use the Brazilian wax. It makes me
feel like every day's a fiesta.

851
01:05:40.484 --> 01:05:42.477
Tell Mr. Ratchet his 10:00 is here.

852
01:05:42.653 --> 01:05:44.064
I'm all over it. Yes, sir.

853
01:05:51.245 --> 01:05:52.656
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

854
01:05:53.372 --> 01:05:55.329
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

855
01:05:59.545 --> 01:06:01.372
Oh, Mr. Bigweld.

856
01:06:02.298 --> 01:06:04.207
No, no. Tell him I'm not here.

857
01:06:04.383 --> 01:06:07.170
- Tell him anything, just don't let him in.
- Ratchet!

858
01:06:09.722 --> 01:06:11.631
- I'll cut to the point.
- What happened?

859
01:06:11.807 --> 01:06:13.681
Run out of dominoes?
I'll send you more.

860
01:06:13.893 --> 01:06:16.384
- You're fired!
- Fired? On what grounds?

861
01:06:16.562 --> 01:06:18.685
This company's
never been more profitable.

862
01:06:18.898 --> 01:06:20.689
Profit, schmofit. Now, get out.

863
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.854
No, wait, please listen to me.
You can't do this to me.

864
01:06:24.028 --> 01:06:26.945
This job is my life.
It means everything to me.

865
01:06:27.114 --> 01:06:29.190
You don't know
what I've done to get here.

866
01:06:29.408 --> 01:06:34.117
The lies I've told. The lives I've ruined.
This isn't helping me.

867
01:06:34.663 --> 01:06:36.905
- Get me security.
- Wait, please.

868
01:06:37.124 --> 01:06:39.794
Can't I just make
one more heartfelt plea?

869
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.787
Okay, what did you wanna say?

870
01:06:41.962 --> 01:06:43.540
That.

871
01:06:44.006 --> 01:06:47.422
Oh, my gosh.
I'm as crazy as my mother.

872
01:06:56.268 --> 01:07:00.266
Take that fish to the chop shop
and put my name on his parking space.

873
01:07:00.481 --> 01:07:01.940
Let go of him.

874
01:07:03.025 --> 01:07:06.062
Sure. Listen, kid, it's over. You lost.

875
01:07:06.278 --> 01:07:09.529
Bigweld is gonna be melted down
into next season's upgrades...

876
01:07:09.699 --> 01:07:13.743
...along with you,
your moronic coffeepot and Cappy.

877
01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:16.822
Such a waste.

878
01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:53.942
Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?

879
01:07:54.118 --> 01:07:56.905
I'm the prettiest girl
at the Harvest Moon Ball.

880
01:07:57.121 --> 01:07:59.410
I'll take that as a "no."

881
01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:14.386
Out of the way!

882
01:08:16.807 --> 01:08:18.183
Rodney.

883
01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.984
<i>Road trip! Road trip! Road trip!</i>

884
01:08:33.157 --> 01:08:34.782
You guys are so embarrassing.

885
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:38.661
Oh, that's Rodney.
He's in some kind of trouble.

886
01:08:39.038 --> 01:08:40.662
I've gotta repair him.

887
01:08:40.831 --> 01:08:43.239
Okay, I got your back.

888
01:08:48.964 --> 01:08:52.001
Come on, we've gotta help Rodney.

889
01:08:53.886 --> 01:08:56.555
- No, Piper, you stay here.
- No way.

890
01:08:56.722 --> 01:08:59.807
Let's be honest. We're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

891
01:08:59.975 --> 01:09:02.217
Whatever happens to us,
make something of yourself.

892
01:09:02.812 --> 01:09:05.978
You're the only thing
I've got to leave behind. Goodbye!

893
01:09:06.148 --> 01:09:07.607
He's right, Piper.

894
01:09:07.775 --> 01:09:10.064
They're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

895
01:09:42.601 --> 01:09:44.345
Okay, got it!

896
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.477
Rodney, what's going on?
Where are we?

897
01:09:46.647 --> 01:09:48.391
It's okay. You're all right.

898
01:10:09.045 --> 01:10:11.417
Okay, boys, we got them
right where they want us.

899
01:10:11.589 --> 01:10:13.048
Boost me up.

900
01:10:14.342 --> 01:10:15.966
Watch your hands down there.

901
01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:20.212
Rodney! We're here to save you!

902
01:10:28.439 --> 01:10:30.147
How do you think it's going so far?

903
01:10:39.033 --> 01:10:40.112
The plug.

904
01:10:40.326 --> 01:10:43.362
Hold on, guys!
I gotta get to the other side.

905
01:11:13.984 --> 01:11:16.226
We're out of here!

906
01:11:36.173 --> 01:11:37.833
The chop shop.

907
01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:41.633
- That's it. Game over.
- The game is not over.

908
01:11:42.263 --> 01:11:44.006
This is our moment to shine.

909
01:11:44.181 --> 01:11:47.182
This is where you show
what you're really made of.

910
01:11:49.145 --> 01:11:52.229
In my case, it's a rare metal.
It's called "afraidium."

911
01:11:52.398 --> 01:11:54.806
It's yellow. It tastes like chicken.

912
01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:58.354
I didn't know I could do that.

913
01:11:58.571 --> 01:11:59.946
Rodney's right.

914
01:12:00.114 --> 01:12:05.488
I am tired of just complaining
and never doing anything.

915
01:12:05.661 --> 01:12:07.239
I... I...

916
01:12:07.872 --> 01:12:09.663
I wanna try.

917
01:12:09.874 --> 01:12:11.284
No. Forget it. I'm sorry. No.

918
01:12:11.459 --> 01:12:14.744
Yes! I want to try.

919
01:12:14.962 --> 01:12:16.836
Then you're first.

920
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:20.508
First for what?

921
01:12:20.718 --> 01:12:24.846
They want us to upgrade?
Then let's upgrade.

922
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:34.020
Gasket, you're a sick, twisted,
evil robot.

923
01:12:34.315 --> 01:12:35.477
I try.

924
01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.467
Oh, good.

925
01:13:09.642 --> 01:13:11.350
Company.

926
01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:16.311
So you're the little glob of tin
who's been making all the trouble.

927
01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:18.232
Who are these losers?

928
01:13:18.442 --> 01:13:20.518
- We, sir...
- I'm a woman.

929
01:13:20.736 --> 01:13:22.195
Ouch.

930
01:13:22.363 --> 01:13:25.068
We've come to rescue our friend,
you evil bag of bolts.

931
01:13:25.241 --> 01:13:28.361
And you will be defeated
by the very outmodes...

932
01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:31.786
...that you scorned and defaced.

933
01:13:31.997 --> 01:13:35.580
Yeah, because there's seven of us
and only one of you.

934
01:13:40.423 --> 01:13:42.996
There's seven of us and... Eight, nine...

935
01:13:43.175 --> 01:13:45.132
- Did you count that one?
- I think so.

936
01:13:45.344 --> 01:13:48.179
Could you all stop moving around?!
It's so frustrating!

937
01:13:48.347 --> 01:13:50.139
I think I counted one of you twice!

938
01:13:50.349 --> 01:13:53.552
While you're at it, count these.

939
01:13:58.649 --> 01:14:02.647
As soon as we're done with you,
these hit the streets.

940
01:14:03.529 --> 01:14:07.741
This is the last day
any outmode will ever see.

941
01:14:16.959 --> 01:14:18.703
Did I miss the butt-whupping?

942
01:14:20.463 --> 01:14:22.870
- No.
- Matter of fact, you're a little bit early.

943
01:14:27.511 --> 01:14:32.220
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

944
01:14:32.391 --> 01:14:35.476
- Well, let's get started.
- Testify, sister!

945
01:14:36.729 --> 01:14:39.184
- Charge!
- Charge!

946
01:15:02.421 --> 01:15:04.912
<i>Oh, no! He's got a steel chair</i>.

947
01:15:06.926 --> 01:15:10.626
<i>But he's back up into a neck-breaker</i>.

948
01:15:10.846 --> 01:15:12.804
<i>He's up to the top rope</i>.

949
01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:16.633
<i>- Look at the hang time!</i>
<i>- That's sure gonna leave a dent</i>.

950
01:15:53.848 --> 01:15:56.173
Say hello to my dimpled friend.

951
01:17:20.351 --> 01:17:22.390
This is gonna get greasy!

952
01:17:26.732 --> 01:17:30.730
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I sure am.

953
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:47.704
See a need, fill a need!

954
01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.996
This isn't what I was thinking at all.

955
01:18:02.935 --> 01:18:05.604
What are you doing? Get off me.

956
01:18:07.023 --> 01:18:10.308
Let me go! Do as I say. Get off!

957
01:18:16.532 --> 01:18:17.777
Ma!

958
01:18:20.369 --> 01:18:21.698
My upgrades!

959
01:18:45.478 --> 01:18:49.012
It's all right, son.
You can shine no matter what you...

960
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:52.025
No! Just stop!

961
01:18:52.234 --> 01:18:53.515
Come on, Rodney.

962
01:18:53.694 --> 01:18:56.565
Let's open the gates
of Bigweld Industries forever.

963
01:18:56.739 --> 01:19:00.439
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I need to do first.

964
01:19:04.163 --> 01:19:05.574
Herb!

965
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:07.663
- Herb!
- Honey, what are you doing here?

966
01:19:07.833 --> 01:19:10.289
- It's Rodney, honey.
- Rodney? Is he all right?

967
01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:12.003
Come outside. Hurry.

968
01:19:12.171 --> 01:19:14.377
Copperbottom, where are you going?

969
01:19:14.548 --> 01:19:16.208
What about the dishes?

970
01:19:19.553 --> 01:19:20.882
Hey, get back here!

971
01:19:21.055 --> 01:19:23.807
You'll never wash in this town again.

972
01:19:26.977 --> 01:19:29.729
What is all this?
The whole town is out here.

973
01:19:31.065 --> 01:19:33.472
- Rodney?
- Dad!

974
01:19:33.693 --> 01:19:35.436
There's someone I want you to meet.

975
01:19:35.778 --> 01:19:37.901
- Is that...?
- That's Bigweld, Dad...

976
01:19:38.072 --> 01:19:40.278
...the greatest robot in the world.

977
01:19:40.491 --> 01:19:42.116
Besides you.

978
01:19:42.326 --> 01:19:46.703
- I understand you need a few parts.
- Well, I'm not one to complain.

979
01:19:46.872 --> 01:19:51.333
Well, then don't. I've brought
enough parts to make two of you.

980
01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:55.496
Ladies and gentlebots...

981
01:19:55.673 --> 01:19:58.425
...I came all this way...

982
01:19:58.592 --> 01:20:00.918
Would you cut that out?
It's very distracting.

983
01:20:01.095 --> 01:20:02.589
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

984
01:20:02.805 --> 01:20:04.133
Where was I?

985
01:20:04.306 --> 01:20:07.925
Mr. And Mrs. Copperbottom,
I came all this way...

986
01:20:08.102 --> 01:20:11.685
...to tell you in person
that your son, Rodney...

987
01:20:11.897 --> 01:20:15.480
...the man who got me
off my big titanium <i>toochis</i>...

988
01:20:15.693 --> 01:20:20.734
...is now my right-hand bot
and my eventual successor.

989
01:20:23.868 --> 01:20:25.113
Way to go, Rodney!

990
01:20:27.538 --> 01:20:29.946
Oh, Mom.

991
01:20:31.208 --> 01:20:32.751
Son.

992
01:20:34.503 --> 01:20:37.374
Dad, I know you kind of felt bad
when I was growing up...

993
01:20:37.548 --> 01:20:40.466
...that you couldn't give me
a lot of stuff.

994
01:20:40.676 --> 01:20:42.752
But you gave me
the most important thing:

995
01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:44.844
You believed in me.

996
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:47.257
From the second you were born.

997
01:20:48.225 --> 01:20:51.310
Well, Dad, now I want your dream
to come true.

998
01:20:52.772 --> 01:20:55.227
Dad, you always wanted to be
a musician.

999
01:20:55.441 --> 01:20:58.358
Now be one, for everyone to hear.

1000
01:21:08.829 --> 01:21:11.747
Good for you, Herb!
You did good!

1001
01:21:11.957 --> 01:21:13.500
- Good job!
- Way to go.

1002
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:16.580
Now I'm sure I've got a heart,
because it's aching.

1003
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:19.753
You'll have to forgive me.

1004
01:21:19.965 --> 01:21:22.338
I'm a little rusty.

1005
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.480
Well, there goes our happy ending.

1006
01:21:38.651 --> 01:21:41.605
No. It's a fusion of jazz and funk.

1007
01:21:41.779 --> 01:21:43.273
It's called "junk."

1008
01:21:58.045 --> 01:22:00.252
I love you, Herb!

1009
01:23:21.837 --> 01:23:25.123
- Fender!
- Loretta, my darling.

1010
01:23:26.675 --> 01:23:27.755
Sorry.

1011
01:23:32.723 --> 01:23:34.265
I was on the list!

1012
01:23:36.435 --> 01:23:38.309
Don't you know who I am? Wait!
