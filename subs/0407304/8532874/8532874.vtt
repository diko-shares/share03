00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:28.422
<i>No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21st century</i>

2
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:35.596
<i>that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own.</i>

3
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:42.519
<i>That as men busied themselves
about their various concerns,</i>

4
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.648
<i>they observed and studied</i>

5
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:52.279
<i>the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinise the creatures</i>

6
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:56.325
<i>that swarm and multiply
in a drop of water.</i>

7
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:03.457
<i>With infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe,</i>

8
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:08.545
<i>confident of our empire over this world.</i>

9
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.925
<i>Yet, across the gulf of space,</i>

10
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.889
<i>intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic</i>

11
00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:23.477
<i>regarded our planet with envious eyes</i>

12
00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.648
<i>and slowly and surely</i>

13
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:31.318
<i>drew their plans against us.</i>

14
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.958
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

15
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.085
It's on its way.

16
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.224
Ray.

17
00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:46.643
Ferrier. Whoa.

18
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.772
I need you back in four instead of 12.
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

19
00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:54.109
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

20
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.571
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

21
00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.865
I got to have somebody
who can do double picks.

22
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.493
I wish I could help you, Sal.
It's the goddamn union regulations.

23
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.871
Come on. I'm in a position here, Ray.

24
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.374
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

25
00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.585
You know what your problem is?

26
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:15.255
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

27
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.280
8:30? Did we say that?

28
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.324
We said 8:00.

29
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.453
Hey, this is...

30
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.706
This is one safe-looking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

31
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.167
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

32
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.254
8:00?

33
00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.884
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

34
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.888
There he is.

35
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.975
Get a hug?

36
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.522
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?

37
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.649
The door's locked.

38
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.984
Still working on those manners?

39
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.655
Hello, Dad.

40
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.282
Hello, Rachel.

41
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.747
Yo, Stan, hurry up.
We got to get to work.

42
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:40.090
Here, honey. Let me
give you a hand getting that inside.

43
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.013
-The door's locked.
-Sweetheart, let me get it.

44
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.512
-I don't mind. I don't mind.
-Hey, she said she could get it.

45
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.031
-It's heavy.
-She said she could get it.

46
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.932
It's got rollers. Just roll it, roll it.

47
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.601
Yeah, but we can't roll it
up the stairs, can we?

48
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.062
Really, I got it from here, okay?

49
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.279
It's a 302 V8. It's...

50
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.323
It's gonna be out of here next week.

51
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:10.161
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

52
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.290
You're out of milk.

53
00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.542
And everything else.

54
00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.378
Yeah.
Could you close the door, please?

55
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.214
Because that's my refrigerator.

56
00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.050
I'm gonna go wait outside.

57
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.055
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll see you in a few days.

58
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.099
Bye, Tim.

59
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.228
-I better get this upstairs.
-Let me... Let me get...

60
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.564
-Mom, Mom, Mom.
-Mary Ann...

61
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.358
-Okay, okay.
-Mom, Mom.

62
00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.664
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

63
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:58.001
-I don't hear any complaints.
-No, I do.

64
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.386
Robbie's got a paper on the French
occupation of Algeria due Monday,

65
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.347
which he's yet to begin.

66
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.641
It would be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

67
00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.602
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

68
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.437
-I just gotta type it up.
-No.

69
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.191
-You just got to start writing it first.
-I love you, Mom.

70
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.984
I love you.

71
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.446
Listen to your father.

72
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.033
No shoes on the bed.

73
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.370
We'll be at my parents' house
in Boston,

74
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.455
but don't call the house line,
you know, they...

75
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.099
Well, the point is,
I've got my cell phone,

76
00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.960
so if anything comes up
or you have any questions, just call me.

77
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:41.962
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

78
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.589
-I'll leave the phone on.
-Mary Ann.

79
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.884
It's a good look for you.

80
00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.429
You think?

81
00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.349
Yeah.

82
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.561
Take care of our kids.

83
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.314
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

84
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:05.568
Listen, you tell your mom that
Ray sends his love and kisses.

85
00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:10.198
Right. She'll love that.

86
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.501
<i>The Ukraine,
a country of some 52 million people,</i>

87
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.670
{\an8}<i>is in almost total blackness tonight</i>

88
00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.089
{\an8}<i>in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms</i>

89
00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.966
{\an8}<i>of catastrophic proportion,</i>

90
00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.885
{\an8}<i>which struck the country at
approximately 4:00 a. m. local time.</i>

91
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.684
<i>...EMP, or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a temporary interruption</i>

92
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.478
<i>of all electrical current within its field.</i>

93
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:43.898
<i>As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the EMP here</i>

94
00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:47.402
<i>was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,</i>

95
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.697
<i>measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.
This...</i>

96
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.288
-Baseball season's over.
-Five minutes. It's not gonna kill you.

97
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.791
There he is.

98
00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.006
Boston?

99
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.217
That's how it is?

100
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.722
Is that how it's gonna be?

101
00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:20.894
-Careful with that throw.
-Whatever, Ray.

102
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.039
Mom says you got
a report due on Monday,

103
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.023
so you're gonna work on that
when we're done here.

104
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.734
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just got to type it up.

105
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.486
Yeah, bullshit.

106
00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.573
Yeah? What do you know, Ray?

107
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.659
Everything. Haven't you heard?
Between me and my brother,

108
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.536
we know everything.

109
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.290
What's the capital of Australia?

110
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.751
That's one my brother knows.

111
00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:50.673
Okay with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

112
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:54.552
Just do your report.

113
00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.430
We don't send you to school
so you can flunk out.

114
00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.183
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

115
00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.024
That's half what I've got.

116
00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:11.027
You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

117
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.196
That why you act like such a dick?

118
00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:30.630
What?

119
00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.800
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

120
00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:38.221
-If you want him to listen to you...
-What are you, your mother or mine?

121
00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.308
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to sleep.

122
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.185
I work for a living.

123
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.898
-What are we supposed to eat?
-You know, order.

124
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.092
<i>Three and two...</i>

125
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.321
<i>-Electromagnetic storm...
-The storms were tracked...</i>

126
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:23.725
<i>And I'll have my own little secret.
Good idea, hey, Gary?</i>

127
00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.102
<i>-No.
-What do you know?</i>

128
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.937
<i>You're a snail.</i>

129
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.240
What's the matter?

130
00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.992
Got a splinter.

131
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.997
Where'd you get it? Come here.

132
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.832
On your porch railing.

133
00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.628
Do you need me to... What?
To do what? You want me to...

134
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.132
-You want me to take that out?
-Absolutely not.

135
00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.636
Come here. Let me see it. Let me see.

136
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.137
Dad.

137
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.139
-Just look. Don't touch it. Dad.
-Rach.

138
00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:07.143
-I can't. You're moving it around.
-Okay, but don't touch it. Just look at it.

139
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.729
It's gonna get infected.

140
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.572
-No, it won't.
-Yes, it's gonna get infected.

141
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.566
No, it won't.

142
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.320
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

143
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.657
-Push it out, huh?
-I read that.

144
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.870
You should get TiVo.

145
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.581
-Tim got it for my room.
-TiVo?

146
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.083
It's awesome.

147
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.711
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

148
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.715
Yeah, I'll just put it on my platinum card.

149
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.260
Robbie? Robbie.

150
00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.766
What is that?

151
00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:49.602
Hummus.

152
00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:53.314
-Hummus?
-From the health-food place.

153
00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.775
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

154
00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.030
You said order.

155
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.866
I meant order food.

156
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.577
Where is Robbie?

157
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.122
-He went out.
-Out where?

158
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.625
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

159
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.169
<i>Who said that? Who's there?</i>

160
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.088
<i>It's the clam burglar.</i>

161
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.409
Steven, look at this.

162
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.911
-What's up?
-Check it out!

163
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.251
You ever see something like that?

164
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.962
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

165
00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:01.257
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

166
00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.031
You got to come see this!

167
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.961
-That is so weird.
-What?

168
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.881
The wind is blowing toward the storm.

169
00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:44.092
That is weird.

170
00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.052
Hey, watch it!

171
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.515
Rachel, you wanna see something cool?

172
00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.925
It's okay.

173
00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:28.219
-I wanna go inside.
-It's okay.

174
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.138
I wanna go inside.

175
00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.515
Okay, you go ahead.

176
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.853
That's enough weather for me.

177
00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:39.564
Don't wanna go by myself.

178
00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:47.029
-It's kind of fun, isn't it?
-No.

179
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:50.116
-Come on, like the Fourth of July.
-No, it's not.

180
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.993
<i>Oh, say can...</i>

181
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.547
It's okay. You're fine.

182
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.175
-It hit right behind our house.
-Yeah, well, it's...

183
00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.968
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

184
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.804
because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place.

185
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.139
Shit!

186
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.396
Where's Robbie?

187
00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.399
I don't know.

188
00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:26.736
Is Robbie okay?

189
00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.823
Are you okay?

190
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.867
Where's the thunder?

191
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:35.077
Why won't it stop?

192
00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:50.885
Is it over?

193
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.568
Where are you going?

194
00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:11.781
Just... I'm just checking things out.
Just wait. Wait there.

195
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.575
-Are we gonna be okay?
-I don't know.

196
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.827
-You don't know?
-No, I meant, I just...

197
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.663
Rachel, please.

198
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:22.124
Just stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

199
00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.290
Turn everything off.

200
00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:04.208
Everything is off.

201
00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.670
I can't get one freaking thing to turn on.

202
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:12.633
You believe this, Ray? Every single car.

203
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.554
Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

204
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.347
-The car just stopped, and...
-You're okay?

205
00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.242
-Are you okay? You all right?
-The lightning started to hit

206
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.660
about a block away,
over and over again.

207
00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.787
-And me and this other guy...
-Where the hell did you go?

208
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:26.397
-Over on Lincoln Avenue.
-Lincoln Avenue?

209
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.833
-By the church.
-You see it? You saw the lightning?

210
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.459
-Were you near it?
-Yeah, 26 times we counted,

211
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:30.484
over and over again.

212
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:33.171
The lightning started to hit.
It opened up this hole or something...

213
00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:34.256
-I don't know.
-Twenty-six times?

214
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.740
-Yeah.
-Okay.

215
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:37.950
-You're okay?
-Yeah.

216
00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.077
Good. All right, well,
your sister is in the house,

217
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:43.497
and I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

218
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:47.710
The next time you take my car with
no driver's licence and no permission,

219
00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.378
I call the cops.

220
00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.549
You better be there when I get back.

221
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.469
-Yeah.
-Robbie.

222
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.644
Manny, Manny. Manny, what is it, dead?

223
00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:07.396
All of them. Everything. Look at this.

224
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.732
-The starter's fried.
-Lightning hit it?

225
00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.276
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

226
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.820
-You got any idea what's going on?
-I'm on my way to find out.

227
00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.031
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

228
00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:19.575
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

229
00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:25.039
Hey, they're saying all the lightning
struck down by the church.

230
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:37.927
What the hell is going on around here?

231
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.805
-Let us through.
-Hey.

232
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:42.181
-Let us through here.
-Hey, hey.

233
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.100
What up, Ray?

234
00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.893
I should've known
you two were behind this.

235
00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:48.016
Hey, God's pissed off
at the neighbourhood, Raymond.

236
00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:49.122
-I'll tell you that much.
-Can you blame him?

237
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.147
-You see it?
-Yeah.

238
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.650
-You got power where you are?
-Nope. Nothing.

239
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:54.252
It's the cars, though.
You know, that's the thing.

240
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.362
Solar flare.
That's what this guy told me he heard.

241
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.090
-A solar flare?
-Yeah, he says the sun shoots off

242
00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.633
-these big blobs of plasma.
-Let me tell you something.

243
00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.201
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

244
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.429
-all the electronic stuff like that.
-Can I tell you something?

245
00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:05.931
The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

246
00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.391
Bro, I'm just telling you
what that guy said he heard.

247
00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.095
Okay, I understand, but it just
sounds dumb when you're saying that.

248
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.229
I've never seen anything like this before.

249
00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.720
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

250
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:22.447
-Is this the only place?
-Come on, put that down.

251
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.057
-You wanna step back, please?
-Step back.

252
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.393
-You're gonna fall in.
-Get back.

253
00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.982
Back up, people.
People, back up back there.

254
00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.944
Move back. Everybody back up.

255
00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:38.738
Move back.

256
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.489
Move back.

257
00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:45.661
Is it hot?

258
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.580
No.

259
00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:49.915
-It's freezing.
-What is that?

260
00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:51.751
Hey, move. You feel that?

261
00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:54.962
-I feel that.
-Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

262
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:56.797
-You feel that?
-Feel that?

263
00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.674
-Yeah, I feel that.
-What is it, the subway?

264
00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.093
-There's no subway here.
-F train, maybe?

265
00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:02.595
That can't be the water main.

266
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.013
There's nothing else down there.

267
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.824
-Water main doesn't run through here.
-Feel that?

268
00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:07.848
Well, there's something down there
and it's moving.

269
00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.232
Everybody, move back.

270
00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.526
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

271
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.695
Let's go.

272
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:23.157
Come on, folks. Back up. Get back.

273
00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:33.834
Help me out here. Get back.

274
00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:40.382
-Go! Move!
-Everybody, get out of the way!

275
00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:43.344
Everyone, back up!
Everyone, clear the intersection!

276
00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:47.515
Get out of the way! Back up! Back up!
Get out of the way!

277
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:08.369
-Forget it! Get back!
-Get the hell out of the street!

278
00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.715
Move away!

279
00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:25.427
Come on,
we've got to clear this area now!

280
00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:17.646
That's my car!

281
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:21.567
Go, go.

282
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.819
Get the hell out of here!

283
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:49.970
Oh, my God!

284
00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:52.181
Come on, people! Let's go!

285
00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.016
Come on, back up!

286
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:56.685
Please! Move back!

287
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:20.602
Watch it!

288
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.940
Oh, my God.

289
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.610
Ray, no. Stay, man.

290
00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:39.246
Just stay.

291
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:43.625
-Just stay back here. Stay back!
-Wow.

292
00:25:59.308 --> 00:26:00.642
Come on.

293
00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.945
What happened?

294
00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:20.741
What's going on?

295
00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:23.619
Dad, what's the matter?

296
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.955
What's all that stuff all over you?

297
00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:32.377
-Ray.
-What's all this stuff?

298
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.837
Hello?

299
00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:36.048
Ray?

300
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:12.417
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

301
00:29:12.501 --> 00:29:13.811
What? Why?
I have no idea what's going on.

302
00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:16.481
You're responsible for all the food
from the refrigerator and the cupboard,

303
00:29:16.505 --> 00:29:17.815
-and put it in here.
-What's going on?

304
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.841
-Just tell me.
-Just do it.

305
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.761
-Rachel, sweetheart...
-Dad, you're really scaring me.

306
00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:25.264
-... I need you to get your suitcase...
-Dad.

307
00:29:25.347 --> 00:29:27.933
...the one that you brought,
bring it to me, okay?

308
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:31.144
Can you just do that for me, darling?
Okay?

309
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:47.661
I don't think it's a fire.

310
00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.082
-See? That looks like smoke to me.
-What's happening?

311
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:56.128
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about another minute.

312
00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:03.969
Please.

313
00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:05.721
Please.

314
00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:14.146
-Just keep it down.
-Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

315
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.440
Can you please answer me?

316
00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:20.527
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

317
00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:26.825
-Whose car is this?
-Just get in.

318
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.744
Whose car is this?

319
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:33.999
Hey. Hey, Ray.
You were absolutely right.

320
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:36.626
That is exact... I had to change the...

321
00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:39.755
Ray? Hey.

322
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.215
Hey, Ray? Ray.

323
00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:44.760
Ray.

324
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:49.222
What? Come on, open up.
Open the door, come on.

325
00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:52.142
-Open the door, Ray. What are you...
-Get in, Manny.

326
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:53.536
That's funny.
You got to get out of the car.

327
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.413
-Manny, get in the car.
-It's not my car. It's not your car.

328
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:56.521
Manny, listen to me, pal.

329
00:30:56.605 --> 00:30:58.416
-Manny, Manny, shut up.
-Kids, Daddy's acting crazy.

330
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.418
You can't do this. Guy's gonna
come back, he's not gonna...

331
00:31:00.442 --> 00:31:02.122
Manny. Manny,
I don't have time to explain.

332
00:31:02.152 --> 00:31:03.755
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

333
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:05.298
-Manny, listen to me.
-No, Ray. Get out of the...

334
00:31:05.322 --> 00:31:07.824
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

335
00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:09.659
-What do you mean?
-Okay.

336
00:31:11.286 --> 00:31:12.847
All right, get out of the truck.
I'm not kidding now.

337
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.623
Get out of the car, Ray.

338
00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.541
I'm not gonna get in. I'm not getting in.

339
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:19.378
-Manny, get in with us.
-I'm not gonna get in trouble.

340
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:22.798
-Look, I'm not fooling around...
-Close the door. Close it.

341
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.219
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.
It's not my car.

342
00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:34.559
Get down! Get down, get down!
Get down!

343
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:35.894
Is it the terrorists?

344
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:38.939
-Just get down. Get down! Get down!
-Holy shit!

345
00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:13.265
-Where are we going?
-We got to go.

346
00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:15.326
We got, maybe, like,
the only working car around here.

347
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.437
-I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
-Clear of what?

348
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.997
-We got to go.
-What the hell is going on?

349
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:22.524
-Look, you saw, we're under attack!
-By who?

350
00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:23.942
Who is attacking us?

351
00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:26.820
Rachel?
Rachel, you've got to keep it down.

352
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:28.947
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

353
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.118
-You're freaking her out!
-Look, I'm driving! Do something!

354
00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:35.620
Okay, put them up, Rach.
Make the arms.

355
00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:38.540
This space right here, this is yours.
This belongs to you, right?

356
00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.041
-Yes.
-You're safe in your space.

357
00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:41.644
-I'm safe in my space.
-You're safe in your space.

358
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:43.295
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

359
00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:44.421
-Okay.
-I'm really scared.

360
00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:46.065
I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

361
00:32:46.089 --> 00:32:47.409
-No.
-I'll be two feet away. Okay?

362
00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:48.967
-Okay.
-Will you hold my hand?

363
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.177
-Will you hold my hand?
-Yes.

364
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.095
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yes.

365
00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:56.266
I wanna know everything you know.

366
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.477
This...

367
00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.496
This thing, this machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

368
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.982
started torching everything.
It was killing everybody.

369
00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:06.776
What is it? Is it terrorists?

370
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.654
No, this came from someplace else.

371
00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:13.533
-What do you mean, like Europe?
-No, Robbie, not like Europe!

372
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:28.298
That machine, it was already buried.

373
00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:31.551
Maybe it...

374
00:33:31.635 --> 00:33:34.763
It came down in the lightning storm.

375
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.850
-They came down in the lightning storm.
-What do you mean "came down"?

376
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:41.895
-You just said it was buried.
-No, the machine I'm talking about

377
00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:46.107
was buried, but what came down
in the lightning storm,

378
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:50.695
what operates it, that's the... You know.

379
00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.155
-The what?
-That's the...

380
00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:54.783
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

381
00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:57.536
-It's the what?
-Hey, Rach. How you doing there, girl?

382
00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:58.954
-How is she doing?
-How you doing?

383
00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.163
-Fine.
-She's good.

384
00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:02.624
Yeah? Good.
What was that thing you did with her?

385
00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:03.976
Works sometimes.
She gets claustrophobic.

386
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.418
Yeah? Hey, Rachel? Hey.

387
00:34:05.502 --> 00:34:07.379
-I want Mom.
-Yeah, I know. You feel better?

388
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:10.674
-I want Mom.
-Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?

389
00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:12.235
-Take me to Mom's.
-Listen, what I need you to do is,

390
00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:14.511
is I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?

391
00:34:14.594 --> 00:34:15.845
I want Mom!

392
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.282
When you start screaming like that,
you know, I can't really drive...

393
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:19.808
-Take me to Mom's!
-I know that.

394
00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:21.393
That's where we're going right now.

395
00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:22.811
-Rachel...
-Take me to Mom's!

396
00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.479
I know!

397
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:42.330
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

398
00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.256
Robbie, get the door.

399
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:54.759
Mom!

400
00:34:54.843 --> 00:34:56.595
-Mom!
-Mom!

401
00:34:56.678 --> 00:34:58.513
Mom!

402
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.850
Mom? Tim?

403
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:06.688
Mom? Tim?

404
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.860
-Mom?
-Mom?

405
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.613
-Tim?
-Tim?

406
00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:18.033
Tim?

407
00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.035
Mom?

408
00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:23.705
They're gone.

409
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.915
Is she dead?

410
00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:27.834
She's not dead. All right?

411
00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:29.586
She's just not here, okay?

412
00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:32.047
-They were never here.
-How do you know?

413
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.382
Because they're on their way to Boston.

414
00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:37.510
And so they just
kept on going up to Boston.

415
00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:39.363
They're probably
at your grandma's house by now.

416
00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:40.639
I'm gonna call her.

417
00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:43.600
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

418
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:46.645
Because nothing bad happened here.
Okay?

419
00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:49.064
So we're safe here. All right?

420
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.316
Okay, Rachel? This is your area.

421
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.778
-Okay, you are safe...
-Dad, that's not how it goes.

422
00:35:54.861 --> 00:35:57.656
Okay. Well, are you hungry?
I'll get you some food.

423
00:35:57.739 --> 00:36:00.909
I'm gonna feed you.
Get something to eat.

424
00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.303
-What do we have? We have...
-Busy signal.

425
00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:04.221
-It's one of the fast ones.
-What is this? Ketchup, mustard...

426
00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:07.374
-You think all the circuits are down?
-Tabasco, barbecue sauce.

427
00:36:07.457 --> 00:36:10.177
You know, this is really good, Robbie.
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

428
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:13.338
-What the hell is this?
-That's all that was in your kitchen.

429
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:16.049
Okay. That's all right.

430
00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.177
All right. Okay.

431
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.683
Food. Bread.

432
00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:28.269
Okay. We're gonna have...

433
00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:31.272
Let's get some sandwiches.

434
00:36:33.983 --> 00:36:35.568
Wanna see me deal?

435
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:38.113
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

436
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:40.824
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

437
00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:42.992
There's two for me, one for the house.

438
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:47.706
Okay.

439
00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:50.625
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

440
00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:53.545
Teach you how to play some poker?
A little five-card stud?

441
00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:56.756
-Maybe a little blackjack.
-I'm allergic to peanut butter.

442
00:36:57.549 --> 00:36:59.259
Since when?

443
00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:00.635
Birth.

444
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:06.099
Okay, well, here.

445
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:08.226
You can eat the bread. Okay?

446
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.769
I'm not hungry.

447
00:37:11.312 --> 00:37:13.064
Okay, well,

448
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:15.483
Robbie and I are gonna be eating
peanut butter sandwiches.

449
00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.653
-Want jelly on this sandwich?
-I'm not hungry either.

450
00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:22.031
You're not hungry either? Okay.

451
00:37:22.115 --> 00:37:24.409
Okay, that's fine.

452
00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:35.503
Everybody just relax, okay?

453
00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:39.090
Because we're here now.
We're safe, and we're gonna stay.

454
00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:41.384
And in the morning,
your mom and Tim are gonna be here.

455
00:37:41.468 --> 00:37:43.094
And everything's gonna be fine.

456
00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:44.637
Okay?

457
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.515
Okay.

458
00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:54.022
If everything's fine, why do we
have to sleep in the basement?

459
00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:57.442
-We've got perfectly good beds.
-Hey, it's like a slumber party.

460
00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:59.086
What are you afraid
is gonna happen to us?

461
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.695
Nice basement.

462
00:38:00.779 --> 00:38:04.032
I wanna sleep in my bed.
I've got back problems.

463
00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:07.410
Okay. Well...

464
00:38:07.494 --> 00:38:10.121
You know on the weather channel
when there's a tornado,

465
00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:12.892
and they tell you to go down
to the basement for safety? It's like that.

466
00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:14.959
-There's gonna be tornadoes?
-Okay, Rachel.

467
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:17.670
Hey, no more talking, okay?

468
00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:19.774
-Could you be a little nicer to me?
-No more talking.

469
00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:21.090
God.

470
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.055
-Wanna stay here?
-Yeah.

471
00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.723
-Good.
-Good night. Love you.

472
00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:30.558
Love you, Rach.

473
00:39:45.008 --> 00:39:46.968
Is the lightning back?

474
00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:50.471
No, this is something else.

475
00:40:10.158 --> 00:40:12.744
-What's that sound?
-I've never heard that before!

476
00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:14.245
Is it them? Is it them?

477
00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:17.498
We got to go.

478
00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:19.459
Where do we go?
Robbie, this is your house.

479
00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:21.085
Where do we go?

480
00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:33.765
No, no, no, wait!

481
00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:55.244
Are we still alive?

482
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.692
Down here.

483
00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:55.907
Were you on this plane?

484
00:42:57.116 --> 00:42:59.368
Are you... Are you a passenger?

485
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:09.212
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

486
00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:13.591
Are you a passenger?

487
00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.468
He's deaf.

488
00:43:15.551 --> 00:43:19.263
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

489
00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:20.807
You hear that, Max?

490
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.684
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

491
00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:26.187
Where were you?

492
00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:29.398
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

493
00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:31.442
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

494
00:43:31.526 --> 00:43:33.111
The 83rd Mechanised.

495
00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:35.488
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

496
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:37.291
They've got some kind of shield
around them.

497
00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:40.118
You can't see it, but everything
we fire at them detonates too early,

498
00:43:40.201 --> 00:43:43.454
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

499
00:43:43.538 --> 00:43:47.333
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

500
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.211
There's more than one?

501
00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:52.964
You got to be kidding me, right?

502
00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:56.634
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

503
00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:59.178
So we patched over to DC,
they went down.

504
00:43:59.262 --> 00:44:02.098
LA, Chicago, uplinked to London.

505
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:05.434
Even called the affiliates
to try to get them to catch the feed,

506
00:44:05.518 --> 00:44:08.354
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

507
00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:12.358
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

508
00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:25.163
My God.

509
00:44:26.247 --> 00:44:28.207
You ain't seen nothing yet.

510
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:34.338
I saw that storm.
I was right in the middle of one of those.

511
00:44:34.422 --> 00:44:36.132
Well, you didn't see it like this.

512
00:44:36.215 --> 00:44:38.676
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

513
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:41.762
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

514
00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:46.058
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

515
00:44:46.142 --> 00:44:47.852
Watch it.

516
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:50.730
Watch the lightning.

517
00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:53.065
Keep watching the lightning.

518
00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:58.779
What is that?

519
00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:03.201
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

520
00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:06.245
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

521
00:45:09.207 --> 00:45:11.209
You hear that?

522
00:45:11.292 --> 00:45:13.711
We're getting the hell out of here.

523
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:18.883
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

524
00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:23.554
Hey, were you on that plane?

525
00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:28.935
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

526
00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:32.813
Look at me. Look at me.

527
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.233
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

528
00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:37.276
-Okay.
-Don't look down. Don't look around me.

529
00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:41.113
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna want to look around.

530
00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:42.907
But you're not going to.

531
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.533
-Are you?
-No.

532
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:48.329
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

533
00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:49.705
I'm going right to Boston.

534
00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:52.124
-We're gonna see your mom.
-I'm not gonna look, Dad.

535
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:54.293
That's a girl. That's my girl. Now listen.

536
00:45:54.377 --> 00:45:56.212
-I want you to close your eyes, okay?
-Okay.

537
00:45:56.295 --> 00:45:58.756
Got them closed? There you go.

538
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:01.175
-Keep them closed for me.
-Okay.

539
00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:08.015
Robbie, get in.

540
00:46:09.725 --> 00:46:11.519
-Robbie, get in!
-Why are you yelling?

541
00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:13.104
It's okay.

542
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.191
Get in.

543
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.232
-Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
-Because I don't want everybody

544
00:46:40.256 --> 00:46:42.800
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

545
00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:46.220
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

546
00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:50.558
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

547
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:53.561
-Where is everybody?
-I don't know, running, hiding.

548
00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:55.914
-Hiding in their basements.
-If we had any balls, we'd go back there

549
00:46:55.938 --> 00:46:59.608
-and find one of those things and kill it.
-Right. Yeah, good.

550
00:46:59.692 --> 00:47:01.837
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions, okay?

551
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:03.446
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

552
00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:05.048
-Never's about your speed.
-Stop it, Robbie.

553
00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:07.116
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

554
00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:08.617
-It's "Dad," "sir"...
-Don't fight!

555
00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:10.828
...or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."

556
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:14.206
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

557
00:47:14.749 --> 00:47:17.585
-Dad?
-Yes, Rachel.

558
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:22.173
I've got to go to the bathroom.

559
00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:24.592
Really?

560
00:47:31.098 --> 00:47:33.434
-I got to go.
-Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

561
00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:35.478
There's two things
we got to watch out for.

562
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.147
And the second is people
who might want our car.

563
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.983
-There's nobody around.
-Yeah. I got to go.

564
00:47:48.657 --> 00:47:51.494
All right. Rachel?
Rachel, it's good right there.

565
00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:53.871
I'm not going in front of you guys.

566
00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:56.374
All right,
then just go where I can see you.

567
00:47:56.457 --> 00:47:57.958
Are you crazy?

568
00:47:58.042 --> 00:48:00.044
-Don't look!
-Well, I'm not gonna look.

569
00:48:00.127 --> 00:48:02.963
-Just stay in sight!
-That's looking!

570
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:07.259
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

571
00:48:07.343 --> 00:48:10.638
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

572
00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:13.849
Making a list.

573
00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:59.603
-I told you to stay where I could see you.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

574
00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:15.953
Stop! Don't go!

575
00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:18.289
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

576
00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:20.708
Let me on! Give me a hand!

577
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.376
Wait! Stop!

578
00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:24.295
-Stop! Give me a hand!
-Hey, watch it, kid,

579
00:49:24.378 --> 00:49:25.480
you're gonna get yourself run over!

580
00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:28.466
-Give me a hand! You have room!
-Robbie!

581
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:31.552
-Robbie, you wanna go in that direction?
-Stop! Stop! Wait!

582
00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:34.430
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

583
00:49:34.513 --> 00:49:36.891
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

584
00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:39.226
-You never gave a shit!
-Okay, hard-ass,

585
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.604
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

586
00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:43.248
You tell me what we're doing.
What do we do?

587
00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:45.709
We catch up with these soldiers!
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,

588
00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:47.193
and we get back at them.

589
00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:50.738
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

590
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:55.159
Now let's try one that doesn't involve
your 10-year-old sister joining the Army.

591
00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:57.554
-You have anything like that?
-Why don't you just tell us the truth?

592
00:49:57.578 --> 00:49:59.806
-Wanna try something like that?
-You have no idea which way to go.

593
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.434
-You have anything like that?
-You wanna come off all wise and shit!

594
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:05.169
You only chose Boston
because you hoped Mom was there.

595
00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:07.671
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

596
00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:11.425
You can dump us on her, and then
you'll only have to care about yourself,

597
00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:14.512
which is exactly the way you like it.

598
00:50:16.055 --> 00:50:19.850
Robbie! Where are you trying to go?

599
00:50:19.934 --> 00:50:22.394
What are you trying to do?

600
00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:26.398
Who's gonna take care of me if you go?

601
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:47.461
<i>This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.</i>

602
00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:50.506
<i>If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages</i>

603
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:54.593
<i>from federal, state or local authorities
would have followed the alert tone.</i>

604
00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:57.680
<i>This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert...</i>

605
00:50:59.265 --> 00:51:02.393
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit?

606
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.145
I don't have a licence.

607
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.607
Since when has that stopped you?

608
00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:40.973
Ray.

609
00:51:42.975 --> 00:51:45.311
Ray! Dad!

610
00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.482
You think you could...

611
00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:53.277
You think you could...
Do you think you could...

612
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:55.529
Don't stop.

613
00:51:55.613 --> 00:51:57.781
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

614
00:51:57.865 --> 00:52:00.951
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

615
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:03.912
-Where is everybody going?
-I don't know, Rach.

616
00:52:03.996 --> 00:52:06.123
But we do, right?

617
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:08.125
Yeah, we do.

618
00:52:19.887 --> 00:52:21.555
Why did he do that?

619
00:52:23.724 --> 00:52:25.809
-Why is he doing that?
-He wants a ride, Rach.

620
00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:29.146
-Everybody just wants a ride.
-Can we give him one?

621
00:52:29.229 --> 00:52:32.858
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

622
00:52:32.941 --> 00:52:34.902
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

623
00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:40.074
-Be careful.
-How'd you fix this?

624
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.409
-How'd you fix the car?
-Please!

625
00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:47.498
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

626
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:49.458
Please, get away from the car.

627
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.418
Hey! Stop the car.

628
00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:54.254
-Stop the car!
-Get off the car!

629
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.383
You could carry 20 people in there!

630
00:52:57.466 --> 00:52:59.843
-Stop the car!
-Get off the car!

631
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:01.595
Stop the car!

632
00:53:05.557 --> 00:53:07.184
Hold on.

633
00:53:07.267 --> 00:53:08.852
-Wait, wait.
-Look out. Look out.

634
00:53:08.936 --> 00:53:10.521
Look out! Hold on!

635
00:53:19.405 --> 00:53:20.656
Are you okay?

636
00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:31.792
Stop!

637
00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:33.293
-Ray!
-Robbie!

638
00:53:34.086 --> 00:53:35.629
No, wait! Wait!

639
00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:38.716
No! No, just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

640
00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:40.801
-Just stop!
-Daddy!

641
00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.428
Rachel!

642
00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.805
Get out of there!

643
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.975
Robbie!

644
00:53:55.149 --> 00:53:57.276
Daddy!

645
00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:59.820
-Ray!
-Get in the car!

646
00:54:04.825 --> 00:54:07.619
-Help!
-Rachel! Get out of the car!

647
00:54:07.703 --> 00:54:09.830
Rachel, get... Get out of the car.

648
00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:12.082
-Get out!
-Daddy!

649
00:54:19.798 --> 00:54:21.925
-Take it easy!
-Get off the car! Get off the car!

650
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:27.097
Get off! Get off the car. Move! Move!

651
00:54:27.181 --> 00:54:28.182
Where's my son?

652
00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:29.325
You don't need that, man.
Put the gun down.

653
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:31.810
-Where's my son? Robbie!
-Cool down, man.

654
00:54:31.894 --> 00:54:33.187
-Put the gun down, man.
-Robbie!

655
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.855
Put it down.

656
00:54:39.902 --> 00:54:41.528
Dad!

657
00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:45.115
Okay, man, now, listen.

658
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:48.327
-Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
-My daughter's in the car.

659
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.597
-Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
-Please. All I want...

660
00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:53.290
-Put down the goddamn gun!
-All I want is my daughter.

661
00:54:53.373 --> 00:54:55.918
-I'm taking the car, man.
-Please, I just want my daughter.

662
00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:58.021
Please, let me...
Let me just take my daughter. Can I...

663
00:54:58.045 --> 00:54:59.647
-All I want is my daughter.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:00.982
-Go ahead, man. Take her.
-Take my daughter?

665
00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:02.006
Take her. Yeah. Yeah.

666
00:55:02.049 --> 00:55:03.675
Robbie.

667
00:55:13.101 --> 00:55:14.895
Take me with you.

668
00:56:16.498 --> 00:56:18.542
Have you seen this girl?
This is my daughter.

669
00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:21.378
He needs his medicine.

670
00:56:32.306 --> 00:56:34.224
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

671
00:56:34.308 --> 00:56:37.394
The US, mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

672
00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:39.187
There's nothing going on in Europe.

673
00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:41.982
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

674
00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:44.625
-Completely wiped out some of it.
-I don't give a shit who it is.

675
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:47.112
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

676
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:49.072
If they're all over the place, we're dead.

677
00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:52.034
-Looks like the power's still on here.
-Yeah.

678
00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:54.161
Yeah, power's still on.

679
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:57.247
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

680
00:56:57.331 --> 00:57:00.667
-Hold on. Hold on, move back.
-Watch out there, lady.

681
00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:03.170
I said, move back.

682
00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:43.919
<i>Unless you are O-positive
and Rh-negative, thank you very much,</i>

683
00:57:44.002 --> 00:57:47.005
<i>but we already have
more blood than we can use.</i>

684
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:50.592
<i>Again, if you are O-positive,</i>

685
00:57:50.676 --> 00:57:54.221
<i>Rh-negative, identify yourselves.</i>

686
00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.431
<i>If you are not, thank you very much.</i>

687
00:57:56.515 --> 00:57:59.559
<i>We already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.</i>

688
00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:01.728
Let's go, folks.

689
00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:04.731
This way. This way. Keep it moving.

690
00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:09.027
Keep it moving. This way.
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

691
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:13.365
Please move forward calmly.
The boat can make more than one trip.

692
00:58:13.448 --> 00:58:17.744
Please move forward calmly.
Take your time. Don't rush.

693
00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:20.122
Ray! Ray! Ray!

694
00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:22.666
-Sheryl?
-Yeah. Hey.

695
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:24.459
Oh, my gosh, is this your...

696
00:58:24.543 --> 00:58:25.937
-Are these your kids?
-This is Rachel.

697
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:28.672
Hi, I'm Sheryl. How are you?
This is my daughter, Nora.

698
00:58:28.755 --> 00:58:31.174
-Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
-Hi.

699
00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:34.177
-This is my son, Robbie.
-Just like Dad.

700
00:58:49.067 --> 00:58:52.237
-It's good to see you as well.
-Trees are funny.

701
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.742
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

702
00:58:57.868 --> 00:58:59.870
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

703
00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:02.914
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

704
00:59:03.498 --> 00:59:06.460
-We got sick people here. Let us on.
-Let us on, for Christ's sake.

705
00:59:40.327 --> 00:59:44.206
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

706
00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:47.417
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

707
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:48.752
Cast off.

708
00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:51.797
No more people. No more people.
We're taking the ramp up.

709
01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:20.951
Stay close. Stay close.

710
01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.787
Everybody, stop. Everybody, stop.

711
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:27.207
-Wait, wait, wait. Just...
-Back up. Back up.

712
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.490
-There's room.
-Just stay back.

713
01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.186
There's no more room.
There's no more room.

714
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.795
Just listen to me. There's three of us.

715
01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:34.673
-Five. There's only five of us.
-There's no more room.

716
01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.133
Okay, man, just don't push me.

717
01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.468
-Sir, there's no more room.
-There is plenty of room.

718
01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:41.012
-There's room for hundreds more.
-Sir...

719
01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.222
-Everybody, wait.
-Hold on.

720
01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.682
-You just stay with me.
-Okay.

721
01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:45.100
Grab my jacket.

722
01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:46.768
Everybody, back up.

723
01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:47.978
Back up.

724
01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:49.646
I got you, Ferrier.

725
01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.481
-Oh, Jesus.
-You okay?

726
01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:52.607
-Yeah.
-Come on. Come.

727
01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:55.235
-Okay. Jesus. Oh, my God.
-Come on. Come on.

728
01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.237
Watch out.

729
01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.579
Come on.

730
01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.540
-Move. Move. Move.
-Ray.

731
01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:10.458
Ray!

732
01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.753
-Come on. Come on. Come on.
-Move it! Get out of here!

733
01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.382
Go. I can go with him.

734
01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:18.967
Sheryl?

735
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.303
-Stay back.
-Go with them. Go.

736
01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:22.470
-Ray.
-Sheryl?

737
01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.306
-Everybody...
-Sheryl?

738
01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:27.184
-There's room on the boat.
-Let us through, God damn it.

739
01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.352
-There's still room on the boat.
-She's a child.

740
01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:31.146
-Robbie.
-There's room on the...

741
01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:33.469
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

742
01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.566
Up there!

743
01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.406
-Robbie.
-Just stay with me.

744
01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:43.533
Stay with me, Robbie.

745
01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:48.788
Robbie!

746
01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.066
-Robbie. Robbie.
-Robbie.

747
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.151
Robbie!

748
01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:24.074
-Robbie.
-Come on.

749
01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:26.576
Here. Grab my hand.

750
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.536
Here. Hold on.

751
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.914
I got you. Hold on.

752
01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.832
Take my hand.

753
01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.085
Take it. Take my hand.

754
01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:36.586
Here!

755
01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.526
Oh, my God.

756
01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:19.379
Robbie!

757
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.675
Swim. Swim this way.

758
01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:15.560
-Robbie!
-Robbie!

759
01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:02.273
-Help me. Help me with her.
-Here, Rach.

760
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.654
Don't stop. Don't stop.

761
01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.656
Don't stop.

762
01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.591
Oh, my God.

763
01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:33.114
Robbie, slow down.

764
01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:44.834
Robbie, slow down.

765
01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.893
-Robbie.
-We gotta stay together, Robbie.

766
01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.563
Robbie?

767
01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.148
Stay together.

768
01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:08.816
Robbie!

769
01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.322
Get back here!

770
01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:20.411
Robbie!

771
01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:23.665
No, Robbie! Come back!

772
01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.091
Robbie.

773
01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.134
Don't move. Don't move.

774
01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:38.137
Now, for God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

775
01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.056
-Robbie!
-Stop those people.

776
01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:42.141
-Turn around. Turn around.
-Robbie.

777
01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:44.561
Robbie.

778
01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:45.937
Robbie.

779
01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.355
What the hell?

780
01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.482
Why are you doing this?

781
01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:56.364
Pull back.
Five hundred metres to my 10 o'clock.

782
01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.535
Jekyll, no effect on target. No effect.

783
01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.078
Roger. No effect.

784
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.872
Our mission, Lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

785
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:08.293
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

786
01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.880
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

787
01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.093
Listen to me.

788
01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:18.636
Go back down the hill.

789
01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.014
All of you, just turn around.

790
01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:35.612
-Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
-I wanna be here.

791
01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:37.590
-I need to see this.
-I know it seems like you have to,

792
01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:40.700
-but you don't. You don't.
-Please, let me go.

793
01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.202
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

794
01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.288
What are you doing here all by yourself?

795
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.932
Look, sweetie,
you gotta come with us, please.

796
01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.018
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

797
01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.311
-You can't stay here.
-We gotta go.

798
01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.961
-I'm not gonna leave her alone.
-Leave.

799
01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:54.380
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

800
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.400
-You can hate me. But I love you.
-Let me go. Please.

801
01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.224
-Let me go. Dad.
-I'm not letting you do this.

802
01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.887
I can't. No. Please. Please don't pull me.

803
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.473
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe...

804
01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:05.683
Please, let me stay here. Please.
I can't go with you.

805
01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.310
-My dad's right there.
-Please, come.

806
01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.371
-Please, my dad's right there.
-Will you just listen to me?

807
01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.190
I need to be here. I want to see this.

808
01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:14.776
Wait. Wait. Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

809
01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:18.404
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

810
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.135
All right. Okay. All right.
You're coming with us.

811
01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:24.327
-We gotta go! Now!
-Dad.

812
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.329
-We're going now.
-No, no, you don't understand.

813
01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.872
Dad!

814
01:09:31.793 --> 01:09:33.211
Dad!

815
01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:36.214
Dad!

816
01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:44.347
Let me go! Dad!

817
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.811
Guide on. Guide on. Black Six.
Attack. Attack. Attack.

818
01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.773
Stop.

819
01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:57.026
-That's my dad.
-I'm her father. I'm her father.

820
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.861
-We're so sorry.
-We thought she was alone.

821
01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:01.781
-She was standing by the tree...
-She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

822
01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:07.286
Robbie.

823
01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.924
Robbie!

824
01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.444
Over here.

825
01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:40.987
Over here!

826
01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.325
Hurry.

827
01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.555
Are you all right?

828
01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.348
Hey.

829
01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.352
What about you, huh?

830
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.035
There you go.

831
01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.580
Is that comfortable?

832
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.126
I need you to close your eyes
now, okay?

833
01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.045
You need some sleep.

834
01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:42.924
Dad?

835
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.717
He's gonna meet us.

836
01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:48.137
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

837
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.681
In Boston, at your grandma's.

838
01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:53.935
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

839
01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.520
Mom?

840
01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.940
Boston. She's waiting.

841
01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:02.860
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

842
01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:06.322
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,
and she's...

843
01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:11.077
She's making that awful tea she makes.

844
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.037
And they're all just...

845
01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:17.083
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

846
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.213
What is this? What is this?

847
01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.508
-I won.
-You won?

848
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.885
The walk, trot and canter.

849
01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.012
Third place.

850
01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:41.065
Sing me <i>Lullaby and Goodnight.</i>

851
01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:47.113
I don't know that one.

852
01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.199
Sing me <i>Hushabye Mountain.</i>

853
01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:57.206
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...
I don't know that one either.

854
01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:21.772
<i>I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down</i>

855
01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:25.526
<i>'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town</i>

856
01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.821
<i>Something comes up to me
They don't even try</i>

857
01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:33.993
<i>'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly</i>

858
01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:36.829
<i>She's my little deuce coupe</i>

859
01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.166
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

860
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.753
<i>Just my little deuce coupe</i>

861
01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.507
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

862
01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.517
Peach schnapps.

863
01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:02.188
Disgusting, I know it.
Found a whole case of this shit.

864
01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.072
Thank you.

865
01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.329
I'm sorry about your son.

866
01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.997
We got separated. He's...

867
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:23.209
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

868
01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.217
Did you...

869
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.721
Did you lose anybody?

870
01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:39.558
All of them.

871
01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.897
Harlan Ogilvy.

872
01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:47.233
Ray Ferrier.

873
01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.985
I got water.

874
01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.571
Food enough for weeks.

875
01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:56.158
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

876
01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.035
I'm sorry.

877
01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:01.122
I'm gonna get some sleep.

878
01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:07.837
Those machines,
those Tripods they got,

879
01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.882
they buried them.

880
01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.677
Right under our feet.

881
01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.180
Since before there...

882
01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:20.766
There were even people here.

883
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.437
They've been planning this
for a million years.

884
01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.275
-We're beat to shit.
-Please.

885
01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.652
-My daughter...
-Think about it.

886
01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:38.242
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

887
01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:40.536
Walked right over us.

888
01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:43.831
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

889
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.167
This is not a war

890
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.503
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

891
01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.964
This is an extermination.

892
01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:03.976
You afraid?

893
01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.938
Of course I am.

894
01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:12.735
I been around death plenty.

895
01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:15.821
I drive an ambulance in the city...

896
01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.365
Drove an ambulance in the city.

897
01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:20.701
That's all over now, huh?

898
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.957
You know the people that make it, Ray?

899
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:30.753
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

900
01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.925
It's the ones that keep their eyes open.

901
01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.512
That keep looking at you. Keep thinking.

902
01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.598
They're the ones that survive.

903
01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:46.435
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

904
01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:49.688
Running.

905
01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.399
That's what'll kill you.

906
01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.695
And I'm dead set on living.

907
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:04.328
Dead set on living...

908
01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:09.208
Thank you for taking us in.

909
01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:18.467
Not gonna be exterminated.

910
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:37.486
It's okay. Come on.
I wanna show you something.

911
01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:41.824
We're gonna fight them, Ray.
They got to have a weakness.

912
01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.576
Come. Take a look.

913
01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.920
Somehow they killed a few of these
things in Osaka. That's what I heard.

914
01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.756
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

915
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.341
We can do this, Ray.

916
01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.302
We can do it. We can get them.

917
01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.262
We can figure it out.

918
01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.598
Stay right there.

919
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.869
I have a daughter.

920
01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:28.370
Why did you bring us here?

921
01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:31.290
To fight them together, Ray.

922
01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.877
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

923
01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.422
When the time is right,

924
01:18:38.505 --> 01:18:41.717
take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

925
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.053
Take them by surprise.

926
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.680
We're right under their feet, Ray.

927
01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:49.642
Right here. Under their feet.

928
01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.192
You miss your mommy?

929
01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:42.778
I had a little girl.

930
01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:45.197
Nearly your age.

931
01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:50.786
You know, if anything happens
to your daddy, I'll take care of you.

932
01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.079
Rachel.

933
01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:04.216
You don't have anything to say to her.
Do you understand?

934
01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.635
If you wanna talk to somebody,

935
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.387
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

936
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.973
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

937
01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:13.976
I know what I'm gonna do.
How about you?

938
01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:17.229
You gonna sit here?
Wait for them to come get you?

939
01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.398
Is that your plan?

940
01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.277
Maybe you want to get caught.

941
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:27.156
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

942
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.799
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

943
01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.413
Listen.

944
01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.625
-It stopped.
-Maybe you'll be okay.

945
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:41.587
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and they'll train you as their pet.

946
01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:44.715
You know, feed you,
train you how to do tricks.

947
01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.800
Will you shut up and listen?

948
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:51.967
No.

949
01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.774
Give me that.

950
01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:53.078
You and me,

951
01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:57.374
I don't think we're on the same page.

952
01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:36.496
Ray. Ray.

953
01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:39.416
Ray. Ray. Ray!

954
01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:41.042
Ray!

955
01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:44.212
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

956
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:28.340
Not my blood. Not my blood.

957
01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:33.219
Not my blood.

958
01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:36.264
Not my...

959
01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:38.099
Not

960
01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:40.518
my...

961
01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:44.648
Not my blood.

962
01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:46.733
Not my blood.

963
01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.485
Not my blood.

964
01:30:48.568 --> 01:30:50.195
Not my blood.

965
01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:51.947
Not my blood.

966
01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:53.782
-Not my blood.
-Stop it.

967
01:30:53.865 --> 01:30:54.908
-Stop it.
-Not my blood.

968
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.701
-Stop it.
-Not my blood.

969
01:30:56.785 --> 01:30:58.411
You gotta be quiet.

970
01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:00.622
-You want them to hear you?
-They drink us.

971
01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.624
-Please, they'll hear you.
-They drink us.

972
01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:05.794
Then they spray us, like fertiliser.

973
01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:07.128
You gotta be quiet.

974
01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:10.048
-Drink us, and...
-They're gonna come back down here.

975
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:13.301
Then they spit us out all over
the goddamn red weeds.

976
01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:15.220
Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do?

977
01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:17.305
I can't let my daughter die
because of you.

978
01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:19.432
This tunnel will get us to the city.

979
01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:21.243
We'll have our own tunnels there.
Ready-made.

980
01:31:21.267 --> 01:31:22.787
-Stop it.
-Subway. See what I'm saying?

981
01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:24.372
-We can hide a whole army down there.
-Stop it.

982
01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.156
We'll go underground.
Sneak attacks at night.

983
01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:29.651
Stop. Stop. You stop it!

984
01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:32.988
We're the resistance, Ray.
They can't occupy this country.

985
01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:34.531
Occupations always fail.

986
01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:36.783
History's taught us that
a thousand times.

987
01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:39.077
This is our land.

988
01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.622
We eat it, we breathe it,
only we can live on it.

989
01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:45.500
They can't survive here, Ray.
They weren't built for it.

990
01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:49.379
-They're gonna kill you, brother, not me!
-What are you doing?

991
01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:51.381
-Not my blood!
-What are you doing, Dad?

992
01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:54.676
Whatever you hear, don't take this off.

993
01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.428
-Dad?
-Rach?

994
01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:58.972
-Dad?
-What was that song?

995
01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:02.684
-That lullaby that I didn't know?
-Not my blood!

996
01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:04.853
<i>-"Hushabye Mountain"?</i>
-Yeah, sing it.

997
01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:07.689
-They can take you!
-Please, Rach, sing it.

998
01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:09.190
They can take you!

999
01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:10.775
<i>A gentle breeze</i>

1000
01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:13.486
-Your daughter! Not me!
-Don't stop.

1001
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.488
<i>On Hushabye Mountain</i>

1002
01:32:15.572 --> 01:32:17.091
-They're gonna kill you!
-That's my girl.

1003
01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:21.786
<i>Softly blows over Lullaby Bay</i>

1004
01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:23.997
Forget it! Tunnel!

1005
01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.083
<i>It fills the sails</i>

1006
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:30.378
<i>Of boats that are waiting</i>

1007
01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:36.968
<i>Waiting to sail your worries away</i>

1008
01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:42.265
<i>So close your eyes</i>

1009
01:32:42.932 --> 01:32:46.561
<i>On Hushabye Mountain</i>

1010
01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:51.483
<i>Wave goodbye to cares of the day</i>

1011
01:32:52.192 --> 01:32:57.405
<i>And watch your boat
From Hushabye Mountain</i>

1012
01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:03.661
<i>Sail far away
From Lullaby Bay</i>

1013
01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.650
Rachel?

1014
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:59.777
Rachel?

1015
01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:02.405
Oh, my God, no.

1016
01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:06.826
Rachel? Rachel?

1017
01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:09.120
Rachel? Rachel?

1018
01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.967
Rachel? Make some noise, baby.

1019
01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:24.427
Rachel?

1020
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:27.805
Rachel?

1021
01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:34.979
Rachel? Just talk to me, baby. Come on.

1022
01:35:38.733 --> 01:35:40.735
Rachel?

1023
01:35:43.446 --> 01:35:45.573
Rachel?

1024
01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.172
Rachel!

1025
01:36:01.339 --> 01:36:03.174
Rachel!

1026
01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:12.827
No, no, no! No!

1027
01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.402
Hey!

1028
01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:27.402
Help!

1029
01:38:29.529 --> 01:38:32.407
What is happening?

1030
01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:35.993
Rachel!

1031
01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:09.777
Rachel.

1032
01:39:09.861 --> 01:39:12.488
Rachel. Rachel.

1033
01:39:13.489 --> 01:39:15.450
Rachel.

1034
01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:18.619
Rachel.

1035
01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:21.289
Rachel.

1036
01:39:22.165 --> 01:39:23.374
Dad.

1037
01:39:50.526 --> 01:39:53.446
No! No!

1038
01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:56.115
-Pull me! Pull me!
-No!

1039
01:40:02.622 --> 01:40:05.333
Pull! Pull!

1040
01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:08.044
-Pull me.
-Come on, pull!

1041
01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:13.591
-Dad!
-One, two, three...

1042
01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:15.384
-We got him!
-We got you.

1043
01:40:15.468 --> 01:40:17.053
Keep pulling!

1044
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.188
Everybody down!

1045
01:41:19.448 --> 01:41:21.325
Keep it moving, folks.

1046
01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:26.330
Keep going, sir. Keep moving.

1047
01:41:26.664 --> 01:41:29.208
-Oh, God.
-I don't know what's going on.

1048
01:41:31.002 --> 01:41:32.962
Hold Grandma's hand.

1049
01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:38.551
Let's go, folks. Keep moving forward.

1050
01:41:48.644 --> 01:41:50.438
Put that down.

1051
01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:55.776
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way. Thank you.

1052
01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:06.912
To the left, there, ma'am,
just to your left. Thank you.

1053
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.167
What happened to it?

1054
01:42:15.046 --> 01:42:16.631
It's dying.

1055
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:20.801
Keep moving forward.

1056
01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.064
Keep moving. It's all right.

1057
01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:34.732
You can pass on through. Move along.

1058
01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:35.959
-What happened here?
-I don't know.

1059
01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.985
Something's happening to them.
Please, keep moving.

1060
01:42:38.069 --> 01:42:39.612
-Let's go, move out.
-Let's go, people.

1061
01:42:40.112 --> 01:42:43.240
-Something's happening to them.
-Go. Go, just keep moving, sir.

1062
01:42:43.366 --> 01:42:44.408
Let's go, sir. Let's go.

1063
01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:46.011
Do not stop. Keep moving. Keep moving.

1064
01:42:46.035 --> 01:42:47.429
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's happened here?

1065
01:42:47.453 --> 01:42:50.053
-Did you guys take it down?
-No, sir, it was behaving erratically,

1066
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:52.792
walking in circles, then it went down
on its own about an hour ago.

1067
01:42:52.875 --> 01:42:56.003
Now, please, let's go. Let's go.
Keep moving. Come on. Don't stop.

1068
01:42:56.087 --> 01:42:58.172
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

1069
01:42:59.674 --> 01:43:01.592
How is it dead all by itself?

1070
01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:04.387
-Rachel, I'm not sure.
-Coming through.

1071
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:07.556
Coming through. Make a hole.
Coming through.

1072
01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:29.495
Calm down.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1073
01:43:29.578 --> 01:43:31.223
Calm down and get in the tunnel.
Calm down.

1074
01:43:31.247 --> 01:43:33.124
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1075
01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:48.139
Everybody, calm down.
Get in the tunnel.

1076
01:43:48.222 --> 01:43:51.142
Everybody, on the other side
of the tracks!

1077
01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:55.938
Look at the birds!

1078
01:43:56.021 --> 01:43:57.565
I can't hear you!

1079
01:43:57.648 --> 01:44:00.484
Look at the goddamn birds!

1080
01:44:03.487 --> 01:44:05.698
-No shield!
-I can't hear!

1081
01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:07.616
No shield!

1082
01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:13.998
The Javelin's the key!

1083
01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:16.876
Load the Gustav!
It's gonna be a tough kill!

1084
01:44:17.042 --> 01:44:18.586
Let's go!

1085
01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:21.589
It's safer in here.

1086
01:44:21.672 --> 01:44:23.632
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1087
01:44:23.716 --> 01:44:25.342
Bring out the Javelin!

1088
01:44:34.143 --> 01:44:36.479
Clear! Go from behind! Clear!

1089
01:44:45.529 --> 01:44:48.115
-Let me know when you're tracking!
-Tracking!

1090
01:44:48.199 --> 01:44:49.742
-You got a lock?
-I got a lock!

1091
01:44:49.825 --> 01:44:51.535
Fire the Javelin!

1092
01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:00.628
-I got a lock!
-Fire the Javelin!

1093
01:45:03.798 --> 01:45:05.257
Fire!

1094
01:45:19.855 --> 01:45:21.649
It's okay.

1095
01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:24.735
I love you.

1096
01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:27.238
-It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
-Let's go!

1097
01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:31.158
Keep those civilians out of there.

1098
01:45:31.242 --> 01:45:35.079
Back. Stay back!
Come on, folks, back up!

1099
01:45:39.917 --> 01:45:43.337
Come on, guys, get on the line.
Get up there now.

1100
01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:46.340
-Stay back. Stay right here, huh?
-Hold on right there.

1101
01:45:52.596 --> 01:45:55.391
-It's opening.
-It's opening. Keep them back.

1102
01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.265
Clear!

1103
01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:39.768
No, keep them back. Keep them back.
Come on, stay back.

1104
01:47:15.346 --> 01:47:16.847
Mom!

1105
01:47:44.083 --> 01:47:46.001
Thank you.

1106
01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.151
-Robbie?
-Robbie?

1107
01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:19.201
Hi, Dad.

1108
01:48:20.202 --> 01:48:21.912
Hi, Dad.

1109
01:48:22.621 --> 01:48:24.331
Hi, Dad.

1110
01:48:58.657 --> 01:49:01.035
<i>From the moment the invaders arrived,</i>

1111
01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:04.705
<i>breathed our air, ate and drank,</i>

1112
01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:06.457
<i>they were doomed.</i>

1113
01:49:07.499 --> 01:49:10.711
<i>They were undone, destroyed,</i>

1114
01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:14.089
<i>after all of man's weapons
and devices had failed,</i>

1115
01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:19.386
<i>by the tiniest creatures that God
in his wisdom put upon this Earth.</i>

1116
01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:24.183
<i>By the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity,</i>

1117
01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:28.854
<i>his right to survive among
this planet's infinite organisms.</i>

1118
01:49:29.938 --> 01:49:33.650
<i>And that right is ours
against all challenges,</i>

1119
01:49:33.984 --> 01:49:38.906
<i>for neither do men live, nor die, in vain.</i>
