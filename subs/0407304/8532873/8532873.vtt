01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.056
-Robbie!
-SOLDIER 1: Stop those people.

847
01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:42.141
-SOLDIER 2: Turn around. Turn around.
-Robbie.

848
01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:44.561
Robbie.

849
01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:45.937
Robbie.

850
01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.355
What the hell?

851
01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.482
Why are you doing this?

852
01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:56.364
Pull back.
Five hundred metres to my 10 o'clock.

853
01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.535
Jekyll, no effect on target. No effect.

854
01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.078
Roger. No effect.

855
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.872
Our mission, Lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

856
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:08.293
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

857
01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.880
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

858
01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.093
Listen to me.

859
01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:18.636
SOLDIER 3: Go back down the hill.

860
01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.014
SOLDIER 4: All of you, just turn around.

861
01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:35.612
-Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
-I wanna be here.

862
01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:37.590
-I need to see this.
-I know it seems like you have to,

863
01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:40.700
-but you don't. You don't.
-Please, let me go.

864
01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.202
WOMAN: Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

865
01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.288
What are you doing here all by yourself?

866
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.932
Look, sweetie,
you gotta come with us, please.

867
01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.018
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

868
01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.311
-You can't stay here.
-We gotta go.

869
01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.961
-I'm not gonna leave her alone.
-Leave.

870
01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:54.380
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

871
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.400
-You can hate me. But I love you.
-Let me go. Please.

872
01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.224
-Let me go. Dad.
-I'm not letting you do this.

873
01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.887
RACHEL: I can't. No.
Please. Please don't pull me.

874
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.473
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe...

875
01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:05.683
Please, let me stay here. Please.
I can't go with you.

876
01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.310
-My dad's right there.
-Please, come.

877
01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.371
-Please, my dad's right there.
-Will you just listen to me?

878
01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.190
I need to be here. I want to see this.

879
01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:14.776
Wait. Wait. Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

880
01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:18.404
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

881
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.385
WOMAN: All right. Okay. All right.
You're coming with us.

882
01:09:23.409 --> 01:09:24.637
-MAN: We gotta go! Now!
-RACHEL: Dad.

883
01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.555
-WOMAN: We're going now.
-RACHEL: No, no, you don't understand.

884
01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:28.039
Dad!

885
01:09:31.793 --> 01:09:33.211
Dad!

886
01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:36.214
Dad!

887
01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:44.347
Let me go! Dad!

888
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.811
Guide on. Guide on. Black Six.
Attack. Attack. Attack.

889
01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.773
Stop.

890
01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:57.026
-That's my dad.
-I'm her father. I'm her father.

891
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.861
-We're so sorry.
-We thought she was alone.

892
01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:01.781
-She was standing by the tree...
-She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

893
01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:07.286
Robbie.

894
01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.924
Robbie!

895
01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.444
Over here.

896
01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:40.987
Over here!

897
01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.325
Hurry.

898
01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.555
Are you all right?

899
01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.348
Hey.

900
01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.352
What about you, huh?

901
01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.688
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

902
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.035
RAY: There you go.

903
01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.580
Is that comfortable?

904
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.126
I need you to close your eyes
now, okay?

905
01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.045
You need some sleep.

906
01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:42.924
Dad?

907
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.717
He's gonna meet us.

908
01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:48.137
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

909
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.681
In Boston, at your grandma's.

910
01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:53.935
RACHEL: What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

911
01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.520
RAY: Mom?

912
01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.940
Boston. She's waiting.

913
01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:02.860
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

914
01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:06.322
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,
and she's...

915
01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:11.077
She's making that awful tea she makes.

916
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.037
And they're all just...

917
01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:17.083
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

918
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.213
What is this? What is this?

919
01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.508
-I won.
-You won?

920
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.885
The walk, trot and canter.

921
01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.012
Third place.

922
01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:41.065
Sing me <i>Lullaby and Goodnight.</i>

923
01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:47.113
I don't know that one.

924
01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.199
Sing me <i>Hushabye Mountain.</i>

925
01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:57.206
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...
I don't know that one either.

926
01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:21.772
(SINGING) <i>I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down</i>

927
01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:25.526
<i>'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town</i>

928
01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.821
<i>Something comes up to me
They don't even try</i>

929
01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:33.993
<i>'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly</i>

930
01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:36.829
<i>She's my little deuce coupe</i>

931
01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.166
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

932
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.753
<i>Just my little deuce coupe</i>

933
01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.507
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

934
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.097
(GLASS CLINKING)

935
01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.517
Peach schnapps.

936
01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:02.188
Disgusting, I know it.
Found a whole case of this shit.

937
01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.072
Thank you.

938
01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.329
I'm sorry about your son.

939
01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.997
We got separated. He's...

940
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:23.209
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

941
01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.217
Did you...

942
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.721
Did you lose anybody?

943
01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:39.558
All of them.

944
01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.897
Harlan Ogilvy.

945
01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:47.233
Ray Ferrier.

946
01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.985
I got water.

947
01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.571
Food enough for weeks.

948
01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:56.158
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

949
01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.035
I'm sorry.

950
01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:01.122
I'm gonna get some sleep.

951
01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:07.837
Those machines,
those Tripods they got,

952
01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.882
they buried them.

953
01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.677
Right under our feet.

954
01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.180
Since before there...

955
01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:20.766
There were even people here.

956
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.437
They've been planning this
for a million years.

957
01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.275
-We're beat to shit.
-Please.

958
01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.652
-My daughter...
-Think about it.

959
01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:38.242
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

960
01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:40.536
Walked right over us.

961
01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:43.831
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

962
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.167
This is not a war

963
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.503
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

964
01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.964
This is an extermination.

965
01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:03.976
You afraid?

966
01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.938
Of course I am.

967
01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:12.735
I been around death plenty.

968
01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:15.821
I drive an ambulance in the city...

969
01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.365
Drove an ambulance in the city.

970
01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:20.701
That's all over now, huh?

971
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.957
You know the people that make it, Ray?

972
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:30.753
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

973
01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.925
It's the ones that keep their eyes open.

974
01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.512
That keep looking at you. Keep thinking.

975
01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.598
They're the ones that survive.

976
01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:46.435
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

977
01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:49.688
Running.

978
01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.399
That's what'll kill you.

979
01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.695
And I'm dead set on living.

980
01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.366
(LAUGHS)

981
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:04.328
Dead set on living...

982
01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:09.208
Thank you for taking us in.

983
01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:18.467
OGILVY: Not gonna be exterminated.

984
01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:20.511
(RUMBLING)

985
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:37.486
It's okay. Come on.
I wanna show you something.

986
01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:41.824
We're gonna fight them, Ray.
They got to have a weakness.

987
01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.576
Come. Take a look.

988
01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.920
Somehow they killed a few of these
things in Osaka. That's what I heard.

989
01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.756
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

990
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.341
We can do this, Ray.

991
01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.302
We can do it. We can get them.

992
01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.262
We can figure it out.

993
01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.598
Stay right there.

994
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.869
I have a daughter.

995
01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:28.370
Why did you bring us here?

996
01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:31.290
To fight them together, Ray.

997
01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.877
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

998
01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.422
When the time is right,

999
01:18:38.505 --> 01:18:41.717
take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

1000
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.053
Take them by surprise.

1001
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.680
We're right under their feet, Ray.

1002
01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:49.642
Right here. Under their feet.

1003
01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.192
OGILVY: You miss your mommy?

1004
01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:42.778
I had a little girl.

1005
01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:45.197
Nearly your age.

1006
01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:50.786
You know, if anything happens
to your daddy, I'll take care of you.

1007
01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.079
RAY: Rachel.

1008
01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:04.216
You don't have anything to say to her.
Do you understand?

1009
01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.635
If you wanna talk to somebody,

1010
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.387
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

1011
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.973
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

1012
01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:13.976
I know what I'm gonna do.
How about you?

1013
01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:17.229
You gonna sit here?
Wait for them to come get you?

1014
01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.398
Is that your plan?

1015
01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.277
Maybe you want to get caught.

1016
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:27.156
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

1017
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.799
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

1018
01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.413

NARRATOR: <i>From the moment
the invaders arrived,</i>

01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:04.705
<i>breathed our air, ate and drank,</i>

1217
01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:06.457
<i>they were doomed.</i>

1218
01:49:07.499 --> 01:49:10.711
<i>They were undone, destroyed,</i>

1219
01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:14.089
<i>after all of man's weapons
and devices had failed,</i>

1220
01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:19.386
<i>by the tiniest creatures that God
in his wisdom put upon this Earth.</i>

1221
01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:24.183
<i>By the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity,</i>

1222
01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:28.854
<i>his right to survive among
this planet's infinite organisms.</i>

1223
01:49:29.938 --> 01:49:33.650
<i>And that right is ours
against all challenges,</i>

1224
01:49:33.984 --> 01:49:38.906
<i>for neither do men live, nor die, in vain.</i>
