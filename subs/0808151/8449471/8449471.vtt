You pulled us off
the power grid, Philippe.

34
00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:23.410
Because you're scaring the hell
out of everyone.

35
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:27.113
The collider was never intended
to generate antimatter.

36
00:04:27.114 --> 00:04:30.617
All three canisters are stored
under every possible safeguard.

37
00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:33.370
I'm only asking you
to wait.

38
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:34.988
We can't wait.

39
00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:37.657
The bulk of the antimatter
is generated at start-up.

40
00:04:37.658 --> 00:04:39.176
Put us back online.

41
00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:43.013

They're terrified.

<i>He wants us to wait.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

54
00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:19.383
<i>I think if we don't harvest</i>

55
00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:22.168

00:07:19.837 --> 00:07:22.472
It's on a scale
never seen before.

86
00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:25.858
That's a crate of beer on the way.

00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:16.853
Help!

94
00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:21.384
A swim might help your jet lag.

95
00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:22.669
I beg your pardon?

96
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.237
You got bags under your eyes.

97
00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.056
It's 5 in the morning.

98
00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:28.007
And you're from the Vatican.

99
00:10:29.944 --> 00:10:31.561
Crossed keys
under the triregnum.

100
00:10:31.562 --> 00:10:33.946
It's a papal symbol.

101
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:40.737
Claudio Vincenzi, Corpo Della
Gendarmeria vaticano.

102
00:10:40.738 --> 00:10:43.256
Vatican police?

103
00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:46.526
I was expecting another letter.

104
00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:52.231
My request for access
to your archives.

105
00:10:52.232 --> 00:10:54.167
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

106
00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:56.386
A kind of busy time
for you guys, isn't it?

107
00:10:56.387 --> 00:10:59.939
In fact, I was in new York,
detailed to the U.N.

108
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.074
I receive a phone call
in the middle of the night:

109
00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:04.811
"find professor Robert Langdon.

110
00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:07.681
A matter of great urgency."

111
00:11:07.682 --> 00:11:11.968
They said to show you this.

112
00:11:21.529 --> 00:11:24.330
The illuminati? They disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

113
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:26.333
Did they? Look at that again.

114
00:11:26.334 --> 00:11:27.517
It's an ambigram.

115
00:11:27.518 --> 00:11:29.719
It's the same image
forward and backward.

116
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.488
Now, that's common for a symbol,

117
00:11:31.489 --> 00:11:33.106
Like a yin and yang
or a swastika,

118
00:11:33.107 --> 00:11:34.457
But that's a word.

119
00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:36.759
That illuminati
ambigramatic symbol

120
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.629
Has been considered a myth
for 400 years.

121
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.397
Supposedly,
in the 16th century,

122
00:11:41.398 --> 00:11:42.999
Some artist created it
as a tribute

123
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.568
To Galileos
love of symmetry.

124
00:11:45.569 --> 00:11:47.203
It was only
gonna be revealed

125
00:11:47.204 --> 00:11:49.639
When the illuminati
had amassed enough power

126
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.008
To resurface and carry out
their final goal.

127
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:53.409
I wrote a book about it.

128
00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:55.895
Which is why you're here.

129
00:11:55.896 --> 00:11:58.197
<i>The art of the illuminati</i>
<i>by Robert Langdon.</i>

130
00:11:58.198 --> 00:11:59.766
Part one.

131
00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:01.568
Haven't been able
to finish part two

132
00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:04.971
Because I'm not allowed
access to your archives.

133
00:12:09.944 --> 00:12:12.545
It's remarkable. Singular.

134
00:12:12.546 --> 00:12:14.547
Someone is trying
to make you believe

135
00:12:14.548 --> 00:12:16.783
The illuminati themselves
have returned to Rome.

136
00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:18.685
Right after the death
of a pope.

137
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.341
Four cardinals were kidnapped
from their quarters

138
00:12:25.342 --> 00:12:26.476
Inside the Vatican

139
00:12:26.477 --> 00:12:29.429
Sometime between
3 and 5 A.M. This morning.

140
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.130
Shortly afterward,

141
00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:34.234
That document was sent to the
office of the Swiss guard,

142
00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:35.835
Along with the threat

143
00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:38.037
The cardinals will be
publicly executed

144
00:12:38.038 --> 00:12:41.874
One per hour, beginning
at 8 P.M. Tonight in Rome.

145
00:12:52.653 --> 00:12:54.004
Conclave.

146
00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:54.988
Was to begin today.

147
00:12:54.989 --> 00:12:56.923
We've postponed its start
for a few hours,

148
00:12:56.924 --> 00:12:58.324
A story of illness.

149
00:12:58.325 --> 00:13:01.561
There are no suspicions yet.

150
00:13:01.562 --> 00:13:04.046
What do you want from me?

151
00:13:04.047 --> 00:13:07.834
These criminals
who sent this ambigram,

152
00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:10.837
Meant it as a taunt,
a provocation.

153
00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:12.639
But Captain Olivetti think

154
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.674
If you can use it
to learn their identity,

155
00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:18.210
Perhaps we can stop
this abomination.

156
00:13:21.782 --> 00:13:23.450
Why me?

157
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:25.502
Your expertise.

158
00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:27.287
Your erudition.

159
00:13:27.288 --> 00:13:29.355
Your recent involvement

160
00:13:29.356 --> 00:13:32.042
With certain church,
shall we say...

161
00:13:32.043 --> 00:13:33.910
Mysteries.

162
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:36.112
I wasn't under the impression

163
00:13:36.113 --> 00:13:39.165
That episode had endeared
me to the Vatican.

164
00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:40.417
Oh, it didn't.

165
00:13:40.418 --> 00:13:42.886
But it did make you--

166
00:13:42.887 --> 00:13:45.672
What's the word?
<i>Forma-- formidabile.</i>

167
00:13:45.673 --> 00:13:47.674
Formidable.

168
00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:51.661
A Vatican jet is standing by
20 minutes from here.

169
00:13:51.662 --> 00:13:52.929
Will you come with me?

170
00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:03.640
"Professore" Langdon,
you've spent your life

171
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.226
Searching for symbols like the
one you now hold in your hand.

172
00:14:07.227 --> 00:14:09.161
How much longer
are we going to pretend

173
00:14:09.162 --> 00:14:11.564
You have not already
decided to come?

174
00:14:18.255 --> 00:14:20.373
If the illuminati have returned

175
00:14:20.374 --> 00:14:23.009
And are in Rome,
we will hunt them down

176
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.895
And kill them.

177
00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:28.313
The illuminati
did not become violent

178
00:14:28.314 --> 00:14:29.616
Until the 17th century.

179
00:14:29.617 --> 00:14:31.518
Their name means
"the enlightened ones."

180
00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:34.253
They were physicists
and mathematicians, astronomers.

181
00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:37.773
They were concerned with the
church's inaccurate teaching,

182
00:14:37.774 --> 00:14:39.893
And they were dedicated
to scientific truth.

183
00:14:39.894 --> 00:14:41.411
But the Vatican
didn't like that.

184
00:14:41.412 --> 00:14:43.562
So the church began to--
how did you say it?

185
00:14:43.563 --> 00:14:46.916
Oh, "hunt them down
and kill them."

186
00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:48.684
Drove them underground.

187
00:14:49.886 --> 00:14:52.489
Into a secret society.

188
00:15:42.455 --> 00:15:44.374
Professor Langdon.
Yes.

189
00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:47.176
Welcome to Vatican city.

190
00:15:47.177 --> 00:15:48.444
Ernesto Olivetti,

191
00:15:48.445 --> 00:15:50.680
Inspector general
of the Vatican police force.

192
00:15:50.681 --> 00:15:52.815
My pleasure.
This way, please.

193
00:15:52.816 --> 00:15:55.884
We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss guard.

194
00:15:55.885 --> 00:15:57.953
I thought
you were Swiss guard.

195
00:15:57.954 --> 00:15:59.888
No, la gendarmeria.

196
00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:01.790
We are responsible
for everything

197
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:03.526
Inside the Vatican walls,

198
00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:07.096
With the exception of
the security of his holiness,

199
00:16:07.097 --> 00:16:08.897
Yeah.
And the apostolic palace.

200
00:16:08.898 --> 00:16:10.700
That is Swiss guard.

201
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:14.470
The Roman Carabinieri are here
as well in an advisory capacity.

202
00:16:14.471 --> 00:16:16.372
So jurisdictionally,
this is--

203
00:16:16.373 --> 00:16:18.491
A goddamn nightmare.

204
00:16:25.132 --> 00:16:28.384
Oh, yes, Pope Pies IX's
great castration.

205
00:16:28.385 --> 00:16:29.719
I beg your pardon?

206
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.821
1857, Pope Pius IX
felt the male form

207
00:16:32.822 --> 00:16:34.974
Would inspire lust.

208
00:16:34.975 --> 00:16:36.776
So he took a hammer
and chisel

209
00:16:36.777 --> 00:16:39.596
And unmanned hundreds
of these statues.

210
00:16:39.597 --> 00:16:43.466
The plaster fig leaves
were added later.

211
00:16:45.436 --> 00:16:49.305
Are you anti-catholic,
professor Langdon?

212
00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:52.709
No.
I'm anti-vandalism.

213
00:16:56.096 --> 00:16:59.198
I urge you to guard
your tone here.

214
00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:03.453
The Swiss guard is a calling,
not a profession,

215
00:17:03.454 --> 00:17:08.257
And it encourages
a certain zealotry.

216
00:17:08.258 --> 00:17:10.426
Commander Richter,
the head of the guard,

217
00:17:10.427 --> 00:17:12.261
Is a deeply spiritual man,

218
00:17:12.262 --> 00:17:14.963
And he was close
to the late pope. Understood?

219
00:17:14.964 --> 00:17:16.565
Look,
I don't study symbols

220
00:17:16.566 --> 00:17:18.267
Because I consider them
unimportant.

221
00:17:18.268 --> 00:17:20.770
Ceremony, traditions,
it's how we Mark our lives.

222
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:22.772
I just--
I just hope I can help.

223
00:17:22.773 --> 00:17:24.574
So do I.

224
00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:26.976
You were my idea.

225
00:17:38.321 --> 00:17:40.889
Wait here. Please.

226
00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:44.560
Commander?

227
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:46.329
Commander Richter?

228
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.731
Professor Langdon
is here.

229
00:17:48.732 --> 00:17:51.433
Well, we have bigger problems
than that now.

230
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.255
Dr. Vetra?

231
00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:59.092
I'm commander Richter,
<i>Comandante principale</i>

232
00:17:59.093 --> 00:18:01.177
Of the Swiss guard.
Thank you for coming.

233
00:18:01.178 --> 00:18:02.328
Hello.

234
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.848
Professor Langdon.
Yes.

235
00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:08.651
What a relief,
the symbologist is here.

236
00:18:08.652 --> 00:18:11.854
This way, please,
Miss Vetra.

237
00:18:11.855 --> 00:18:14.373
The situation
has changed.

238
00:18:14.374 --> 00:18:17.910
We received another threat
from the kidnapper.

239
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:21.080
The canister was stolen from
our lab around noon yesterday.

240
00:18:21.081 --> 00:18:24.533
The intruder killed my research
partner, Silvano Bentivoglio,

241
00:18:24.534 --> 00:18:27.937
And mutilated him
in order to bypass security.

242
00:18:27.938 --> 00:18:30.123
We use retinal scanners.

243
00:18:30.124 --> 00:18:32.792
They cut out his eye.

244
00:18:32.793 --> 00:18:37.013
Is that your stolen canister,
Miss Vetra?

245
00:18:37.014 --> 00:18:38.798
Where is that camera,
number 86?

246
00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.383
It's wireless.

247
00:18:40.384 --> 00:18:42.769
It too was stolen. It could be
anywhere inside the Vatican.

248
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.036
That canister contains

249
00:18:44.037 --> 00:18:46.505
An extremely combustible
substance called antimatter.

250
00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:49.108
We need to locate it immediately
or evacuate Vatican city.

251
00:18:49.109 --> 00:18:51.777
I'm quite familiar
with incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

252
00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:54.313
I've never heard of antimatter
being used as such.

253
00:18:54.314 --> 00:18:55.598
Well, it's never
been generated

254
00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:57.533
In significant quantities
before.

255
00:18:57.534 --> 00:19:00.219
It's a way of studying
the origins of the universe,

256
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.322
To try to isolate what some
people call "the God particle."

257
00:19:03.323 --> 00:19:05.891
But there are implications
for energy research--

258
00:19:05.892 --> 00:19:07.710
"the God particle"?

259
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:10.630
What we call it
isn't important.

260
00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:12.381
It's what gives
all matter mass.

261
00:19:12.382 --> 00:19:14.467
The thing without which
we could not exist.

262
00:19:14.468 --> 00:19:17.336
You're talking about
the moment of creation.

263
00:19:17.337 --> 00:19:19.989
Yes. In a way, I am.

264
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.508
The antimatter
is suspended there

265
00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:24.010
In an airtight
nanocomposite shell

266
00:19:24.011 --> 00:19:25.678
With electromagnets in each end.

267
00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:27.964
But if it were to fall
out of suspension

268
00:19:27.965 --> 00:19:29.465
And come in contact
with matter,

269
00:19:29.466 --> 00:19:31.567
Say, the bottom of the canister,

270
00:19:31.568 --> 00:19:32.618
The two opposing forces

271
00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:34.821
Would annihilate one another
violently.

272
00:19:34.822 --> 00:19:37.106
What might cause it
to fall out of suspension?

273
00:19:37.107 --> 00:19:38.858
The battery going dead.

274
00:19:38.859 --> 00:19:41.694
Which it will,
just before midnight.

275
00:19:41.695 --> 00:19:43.413
What kind of annihilation?
How violent?

276
00:19:43.414 --> 00:19:45.281
A cataclysmic event.

277
00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:50.169
A blinding explosion equivalent
to about five kilotons.

278
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.189
Vatican city
will be consumed by light.

279
00:19:55.592 --> 00:19:58.544
Those are the exact words
the kidnapper used.

280
00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:02.681
<i>We will destroy your four pillars.</i>

281
00:20:02.682 --> 00:20:05.017
<i>We will brand your preferiti,</i>

282
00:20:05.018 --> 00:20:08.471
<i>And sacrifice them</i>
<i>on the altars of science,</i>

283
00:20:08.472 --> 00:20:11.808
<i>Then bring your church down</i>
<i>upon you.</i>

284
00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:15.160
<i>Vatican city</i>
<i>will be consumed by light.</i>

285
00:20:15.161 --> 00:20:19.515
<i>A shining star at the end</i>
<i>of the path of illumination.</i>

286
00:20:25.122 --> 00:20:27.123
It's the ancient
illuminati threat.

287
00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:29.291
Destruction of Vatican city
through light.

288
00:20:30.393 --> 00:20:34.063
Four pillars, there's your
kidnapped cardinals.

289
00:20:34.064 --> 00:20:36.132
You didn't tell me
they were the "preferiti",

290
00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:39.435
The favorites,
to be named the next pope.

291
00:20:41.154 --> 00:20:42.255
Play it again.

292
00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:52.464
<i>We will destroy your four pillars.</i>

293
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.153
<i>We will brand your preferiti--</i>
wait, stop it. Stop it.

294
00:20:59.106 --> 00:21:01.807
"brand" them.

295
00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:05.978
That's another
illuminati legend.

296
00:21:05.979 --> 00:21:08.197
This one says that there are

297
00:21:08.198 --> 00:21:11.567
A set of five brands,

298
00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:12.935
Each one an ambigram.

299
00:21:12.936 --> 00:21:15.637
The first four are the
fundamental elements of science:

300
00:21:15.638 --> 00:21:18.040
Earth, air, fire and water.

301
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:20.709
The fifth, it's a mystery.

302
00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:24.797
Maybe it's this.

303
00:21:24.798 --> 00:21:27.099
He said they'd be killed
publicly.

304
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.768
Yes.

305
00:21:28.769 --> 00:21:31.687
Revenge for <i>la purga.</i>

306
00:21:31.688 --> 00:21:33.438
<i>"la purga"?</i>

307
00:21:34.907 --> 00:21:38.410
Oh, jeez, you guys don't even
read your own history, do you?

308
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:41.813
1668, the church kidnapped

309
00:21:41.814 --> 00:21:43.983
Four illuminati scientists

310
00:21:43.984 --> 00:21:45.851
And branded each one
of them on the chest

311
00:21:45.852 --> 00:21:47.987
With the symbol
of the cross

312
00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:50.755
To purge them of their sins,
and they executed them.

313
00:21:50.756 --> 00:21:53.758
Threw their bodies into the
street as a warning to others

314
00:21:53.759 --> 00:21:56.862
To stop questioning church
rulings on scientific matters.

315
00:21:56.863 --> 00:21:58.297
They radicalized them.

316
00:21:58.298 --> 00:22:01.433
The "purga" created a darker,
more violent illuminati,

317
00:22:01.434 --> 00:22:04.303
One bent on retribution.

318
00:22:04.304 --> 00:22:06.806
And look how they intend
to finally get it:

319
00:22:06.807 --> 00:22:10.242
Using antimatter, technology,
to destroy the church.

320
00:22:10.243 --> 00:22:12.711
Science obliterates religion.

321
00:22:13.913 --> 00:22:15.447
Is there any more?

322
00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:20.653
<i>--And sacrifice them on the altars of science,</i>

323
00:22:20.654 --> 00:22:23.689
<i>Then bring your church down</i>
<i>upon you.</i>

324
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.326
<i>Vatican city</i>
<i>will be consumed by light.</i>

325
00:22:27.327 --> 00:22:31.546
<i>A shining star at the end</i>
<i>of the path of illumination.</i>

326
00:22:31.547 --> 00:22:34.650
"path of illumination."

327
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.505
I need access
to the Vatican archives.

328
00:22:41.274 --> 00:22:44.010
Professor, I don't think
this is the appropriate--

329
00:22:44.011 --> 00:22:46.796
Your petition has been denied
seven times.

330
00:22:46.797 --> 00:22:48.564
No, no. This has nothing
to do with my work.

331
00:22:48.565 --> 00:22:50.599
The path of illumination
is a trail through Rome

332
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.751
That leads to the church
of the illumination,

333
00:22:52.752 --> 00:22:55.838
The place where the illuminati
would meet in secret.

334
00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:58.474
If I can find the <i>segno,</i>
the sign

335
00:22:58.475 --> 00:23:01.644
That marks the beginning
of that path,

336
00:23:01.645 --> 00:23:03.112
The four churches along it

337
00:23:03.113 --> 00:23:05.564
May be where he intends
to murder your cardinals.

338
00:23:05.565 --> 00:23:09.084
One every hour
at 8, 9, 10 and 11.

339
00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:11.904
Then the device explodes
at midnight.

340
00:23:11.905 --> 00:23:14.256
If we can figure out
the first church

341
00:23:14.257 --> 00:23:16.825
And get there before he does
maybe we can stop it.

342
00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:19.128
But I can't find
the start of the path

343
00:23:19.129 --> 00:23:21.080
Until I get into the archives.

344
00:23:21.081 --> 00:23:23.749
Even if I wanted to help you,

345
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.318
Access to the archives
is only by written decree

346
00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:29.472
By the curator and the
board of Vatican librarians.

347
00:23:29.473 --> 00:23:31.924
Or by papal mandate.

348
00:23:31.925 --> 00:23:33.459
Yes, but as you no doubt
have heard,

349
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.344
The holy father is dead.

350
00:23:35.345 --> 00:23:37.596
What about "il camerlengo"?

351
00:23:37.597 --> 00:23:39.231
The camerlengo
is just a priest here,

352
00:23:39.232 --> 00:23:40.900
The former pope's
chamberlain.

353
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:43.269
Doesn't the power
of the holy see rest in him

354
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.237
During <i>tempe sede vacante?</i>

355
00:23:52.846 --> 00:23:55.948
Fellas,
you called me.

356
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.034
<i>His holiness once told me</i>

357
00:23:59.035 --> 00:24:03.005
<i>A pope was a man torn between</i>
<i>the real world and the divine.</i>

358
00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:06.992
It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.

359
00:24:06.993 --> 00:24:08.994
I'm familiar
with illuminati lore

360
00:24:08.995 --> 00:24:10.796
And the legend
of the brandings.

361
00:24:10.797 --> 00:24:14.366
"La purga" is a dark stain
on this church's history.

362
00:24:14.367 --> 00:24:16.669
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

363
00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:21.056
<i>Comandante,</i>

364
00:24:21.057 --> 00:24:23.392
Have you begun the search
for this explosive device?

365
00:24:23.393 --> 00:24:25.194
Of course,
but it could be anywhere.

366
00:24:25.195 --> 00:24:28.097
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

367
00:24:28.098 --> 00:24:30.432
The Sistine chapel
is a fortress.

368
00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:32.268
As long as the cardinals
are in conclave,

369
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:34.569
Your security concerns
are at a minimum.

370
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.071
Devote as many of your
resources--

371
00:24:36.072 --> 00:24:38.407
If you're about to suggest
a naked-eye search

372
00:24:38.408 --> 00:24:39.775
Of the entire
Vatican city,

373
00:24:39.776 --> 00:24:41.810
I will tell you we do not
have the people.

374
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:45.180
Though I am not his holiness,
when you are addressing me,

375
00:24:45.181 --> 00:24:47.716
You are addressing this office.
Do you understand?

376
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.137
Yes, father.

377
00:24:51.138 --> 00:24:53.506
Good.

378
00:24:53.507 --> 00:24:55.608
Now, you said the image
on the screen

379
00:24:55.609 --> 00:24:58.360
Was illuminated
by artificial light.

380
00:24:58.361 --> 00:25:00.662
Might I suggest
methodically cutting power

381
00:25:00.663 --> 00:25:02.831
To various sections
of the city.

382
00:25:02.832 --> 00:25:05.534
When the image goes dark,
you'll have a specific idea

383
00:25:05.535 --> 00:25:07.869
Of the camera's location.

384
00:25:11.141 --> 00:25:14.743
Dr. Vetra, besides yourself
and your research partner,

385
00:25:14.744 --> 00:25:18.497
Who else knew about this
antimatter project?

386
00:25:18.498 --> 00:25:20.849
No one
but the research team.

387
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.135
This project was strictly
confidential.

388
00:25:23.136 --> 00:25:25.304
But Silvano kept detailed
journals.

389
00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:26.956
If he told anyone else

390
00:25:26.957 --> 00:25:29.875
About what we were doing,
he would have made a note of it.

391
00:25:29.876 --> 00:25:31.677
Do you have
these journals?

392
00:25:31.678 --> 00:25:33.846
I can have them flown here
from Geneva in an hour.

393
00:25:33.847 --> 00:25:34.946
Please.

394
00:25:37.267 --> 00:25:38.601
Professor Langdon.

395
00:25:49.562 --> 00:25:51.663
Mr. Langdon,

396
00:25:51.664 --> 00:25:55.634
You are correct that I may Grant
you access to the archives.

397
00:25:57.437 --> 00:25:59.405
Thank you, padre.

398
00:25:59.406 --> 00:26:04.243
I said that you were correct
that I may, not that I will.

399
00:26:04.244 --> 00:26:07.529
Christianity's most sacred
codices are in that archive.

400
00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:12.418
Given your recent entanglement
with the church,

401
00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:14.286
There is a question
I'd like to ask you first,

402
00:26:14.287 --> 00:26:17.322
Here, in the office
of his holiness.

403
00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:26.982
Do you believe in God, sir?

404
00:26:30.553 --> 00:26:34.189
Father, I simply believe
that religion--

405
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.776
I did not ask if you believe
what man says about God.

406
00:26:37.777 --> 00:26:39.978
I asked if you believe in God.

407
00:26:42.498 --> 00:26:45.400
I'm an academic.

408
00:26:45.401 --> 00:26:48.603
My mind tells me
I will never

409
00:26:48.604 --> 00:26:50.972
Understand God.

410
00:26:50.973 --> 00:26:52.991
And your heart?

411
00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:57.862
Tells me I'm not meant to.

412
00:26:59.265 --> 00:27:01.199
Faith is a gift

413
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.435
That I have yet to receive.

414
00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:13.229
Be delicate with our treasures.

415
00:27:18.685 --> 00:27:20.169
The archives are this way.

416
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.953
Professor Langdon.

417
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.508
If this path really leads
to the church of illumination,

418
00:27:26.509 --> 00:27:28.643
That may be where they've hidden
the antimatter.

419
00:27:28.644 --> 00:27:31.046
"a shining star at the end
of the path." I thought so too.

420
00:27:31.047 --> 00:27:34.300
Follow the path, and we may find
the canister at the end of it.

421
00:27:34.301 --> 00:27:36.819
Can you deactivate the device?
I can change the batteries,

422
00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.021
As long as we have
more than five minutes of life.

423
00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:41.173
That would give us
another 24 hours

424
00:27:41.174 --> 00:27:43.759
To get it safely
back to Cern.

425
00:27:45.478 --> 00:27:46.595
Robert Langdon.

426
00:27:46.596 --> 00:27:48.464
Vittoria ventral.

427
00:27:48.465 --> 00:27:52.234
Are you really a symbologist,
or was he mocking you?

428
00:27:52.235 --> 00:27:54.536
Well, both.
You're a physicist?

429
00:27:54.537 --> 00:27:56.171
Bio-entanglement
physics.

430
00:27:56.172 --> 00:27:57.906
Interconnectivity
of life systems.

431
00:27:57.907 --> 00:27:59.375
Okay.

432
00:27:59.376 --> 00:28:02.695
Your project, it was geared
towards energy research?

433
00:28:02.696 --> 00:28:03.879
Eventually, yes.

434
00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.380
One speck of antimatter

435
00:28:05.381 --> 00:28:08.116
Could power an entire city
for a month.

436
00:28:08.117 --> 00:28:10.869
Or tonight,
I guess, destroy one.

437
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.923
What are we looking for in the archives?

438
00:28:13.924 --> 00:28:15.507
A bound volume
written by Galileo.

439
00:28:15.508 --> 00:28:17.176
Galileo
was illuminati?

440
00:28:17.177 --> 00:28:19.544
Yeah.
And an obedient catholic,

441
00:28:19.545 --> 00:28:22.347
Who didn't think that church
and science were enemies,

442
00:28:22.348 --> 00:28:24.850
But just a different language
telling the same story.

443
00:28:24.851 --> 00:28:27.485
He wanted like minds to find
the church of illumination,

444
00:28:27.486 --> 00:28:29.688
But he couldn't exactly
advertise its location

445
00:28:29.689 --> 00:28:31.656
So he created
a coded path.

446
00:28:33.143 --> 00:28:36.378
Richter has started to turn off
the power of various grids.

447
00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:37.613
It'll be back on in a minute.

448
00:28:39.015 --> 00:28:43.018
Then some unknown illuminati
master sculpted four statues.

449
00:28:43.019 --> 00:28:46.187
Each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements,

450
00:28:46.188 --> 00:28:48.156
Earth, air, fire, water,

451
00:28:48.157 --> 00:28:50.042
And placed the statues
out in public

452
00:28:50.043 --> 00:28:51.643
In churches
throughout Rome.

453
00:28:51.644 --> 00:28:54.479
Each statue held a clue
pointing to the next.

454
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.115
At the end of the path
was the church of illumination.

455
00:28:57.116 --> 00:29:00.386
If you could find that,
you were one of them.

456
00:29:00.387 --> 00:29:01.754
What makes you think
he'll murder

457
00:29:01.755 --> 00:29:03.255
The cardinals
in the churches?

458
00:29:03.256 --> 00:29:05.591
The illuminati called
those four churches

459
00:29:05.592 --> 00:29:09.728
By the special name,
<i>L'altare Della Scienza.</i>

460
00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:12.831
"sacrifice them on the altars
of science," he said.

461
00:29:12.832 --> 00:29:14.683
Exactly.

462
00:29:17.103 --> 00:29:20.805
Oh, wow. Look at this.

463
00:29:45.882 --> 00:29:48.083
Excuse me, <i>signore.</i>

464
00:29:49.618 --> 00:29:52.620
Cardinal Strauss, you've been
informed of the situation?

465
00:29:52.621 --> 00:29:54.273
Yeah.

466
00:29:54.274 --> 00:29:58.477
My belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave.

467
00:29:58.478 --> 00:30:02.180
At this late hour?
That would be highly unorthodox.

468
00:30:02.181 --> 00:30:03.815
And yet within
church law.

469
00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:05.784
It's in my power.
I am great elector.

470
00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:08.203
The cruelest honor
in Christendom.

471
00:30:08.204 --> 00:30:11.623
I have no personal ambitions,
Patrick.

472
00:30:11.624 --> 00:30:13.992
Only those I hold
for my church,

473
00:30:13.993 --> 00:30:15.661
St. Peter's church,

474
00:30:15.662 --> 00:30:18.730
Which is under attack
at its most vulnerable moment.

475
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:20.231
And this is not
a coincidence.

476
00:30:20.232 --> 00:30:21.850
The church will not
fall in a day.

477
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:23.802
We must evacuate
Vatican city.

478
00:30:23.803 --> 00:30:26.921
Oh, that is exactly
what they want.

479
00:30:26.922 --> 00:30:28.690
Publicity and panic.

480
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:32.794
No, we must not give them oxygen
for the media fire.

481
00:30:32.795 --> 00:30:35.314
But the people
in St. Peter's square--

482
00:30:35.315 --> 00:30:39.467
Care deeply about
their church, as we do.

483
00:30:39.468 --> 00:30:42.187
Their Faith
will sustain them.

484
00:30:42.188 --> 00:30:44.990
Their Faith will not
protect them from an explosion.

485
00:30:44.991 --> 00:30:46.525
Well...

486
00:30:46.526 --> 00:30:49.111
We all are bound
for Heaven eventually,

487
00:30:49.112 --> 00:30:51.179
Are we not?

488
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.215
Spoken like one who has enjoyed
the blessings

489
00:30:53.216 --> 00:30:54.682
Of a long and full life.

490
00:30:54.683 --> 00:30:56.418
Patrick,

491
00:30:56.419 --> 00:30:57.852
Do not confuse the power

492
00:30:57.853 --> 00:30:59.888
Of the office
you temporarily hold

493
00:30:59.889 --> 00:31:03.008
With your true place
here in the Vatican.

494
00:31:04.594 --> 00:31:07.379
You were a favorite
of his holiness,

495
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.166
But his holiness
is with his father now.

496
00:31:13.636 --> 00:31:15.187
<i>Mea culpa.</i>

497
00:31:15.188 --> 00:31:17.221
Seal the doors.

498
00:31:31.371 --> 00:31:34.322
<i>Extra omnes.</i>

499
00:32:26.943 --> 00:32:29.761
Hello. This way, please.

500
00:32:29.762 --> 00:32:32.664
Oh, beautiful.

501
00:32:36.502 --> 00:32:38.804
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

502
00:32:38.805 --> 00:32:41.089
Oxygen is kept
at lowest possible levels.

503
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.026
It's a partial vacuum inside.

504
00:32:44.027 --> 00:32:46.211
So extended stays
are not recommended.

505
00:32:46.212 --> 00:32:49.647
So don't panic if you feel
light-headed at first.

506
00:33:01.443 --> 00:33:03.378
I'll be just
outside the door.

507
00:33:03.379 --> 00:33:06.331
Watching you, Mr. Langdon.

508
00:33:55.548 --> 00:33:57.766
Conclave will go on without us.

509
00:33:57.767 --> 00:34:01.887
It must, now of all times.

510
00:34:01.888 --> 00:34:04.522
May God forgive you
for what you've done.

511
00:34:12.298 --> 00:34:14.533
Father, if God has issues,

512
00:34:14.534 --> 00:34:18.704
They won't be
with what I've done.

513
00:34:18.705 --> 00:34:22.457
They will be
with what I'm about to do.

514
00:34:42.862 --> 00:34:45.447
It was confiscated
from the Netherlands

515
00:34:45.448 --> 00:34:48.533
By the Vatican
just after Galileo died.

516
00:34:48.534 --> 00:34:51.253
I've been petitioning to see it
for about 10 years,

517
00:34:51.254 --> 00:34:54.156
Ever since I realized wh--
what was in it.

518
00:34:54.157 --> 00:34:56.408
What makes you so sure
that the "Segnos" there?

519
00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:57.693
The number 503.

520
00:34:57.694 --> 00:35:01.813
I kept seeing it over and over
again in illuminati letters,

521
00:35:01.814 --> 00:35:05.751
Scribbled in the margins,
sometimes just signed "503."

522
00:35:05.752 --> 00:35:07.685
It's a numeric clue.
But to what?

523
00:35:07.686 --> 00:35:10.722
Five? Well, that's a meaningful
number to the illuminati.

524
00:35:10.723 --> 00:35:12.490
There's the pentagram,
pythagoras,

525
00:35:12.491 --> 00:35:14.176
Dozens of other examples
in science.

526
00:35:14.177 --> 00:35:15.544
But what about three?

527
00:35:15.545 --> 00:35:16.961
Didn't make sense
until I thought,

528
00:35:16.962 --> 00:35:18.847
"what if it's Roman numerals?"

529
00:35:18.848 --> 00:35:21.183
D-III.
D-three.

530
00:35:21.184 --> 00:35:22.717
Galileo's third text.

531
00:35:22.718 --> 00:35:27.255
<i>"dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma."</i>

532
00:35:31.644 --> 00:35:33.161
Oh.

533
00:35:33.162 --> 00:35:34.746
Yeah.

534
00:35:38.735 --> 00:35:40.385
Just a few days with this,

535
00:35:40.386 --> 00:35:42.603
And I could have
actually finished my book

536
00:35:42.604 --> 00:35:46.408
And sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

537
00:35:46.409 --> 00:35:48.960
<i>"il diagramma veritatis."</i>

538
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:51.163
<i>Diagram of truth.</i>

539
00:35:51.164 --> 00:35:53.965
I know about
"dialogo" and "discorsi".

540
00:35:53.966 --> 00:35:55.867
Galileo laid out
his theories

541
00:35:55.868 --> 00:35:57.735
About the earth revolving
around the sun.

542
00:35:57.736 --> 00:36:00.839
Yeah, and said the earth was not
the center of some universe

543
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.340
With Heaven above,
hell below,

544
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:03.608
As the church
had said it was.

545
00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:05.727
So they forced him to
recant in the second book.

546
00:36:05.728 --> 00:36:07.679
But what was this one?

547
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.147
This is how he
got the word out.

548
00:36:09.148 --> 00:36:12.017
This is the truth, not what the
Vatican forced him to write.

549
00:36:12.018 --> 00:36:15.537
Smuggled out of Rome, printed
in Holland on sedge papyrus.

550
00:36:15.538 --> 00:36:18.139
That way any scientist caught
that was with a copy

551
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.441
Could just
throw it in water,

552
00:36:19.442 --> 00:36:22.194
And Galileos heresy
would dissolve, disappear.

553
00:36:22.195 --> 00:36:25.563
And between that
and Vatican burnings,

554
00:36:25.564 --> 00:36:28.950
It's possible that this
is the only copy that remains.

555
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:31.286
And if I'm correct,

556
00:36:31.287 --> 00:36:35.807
The "segno" is hidden
on page number--

557
00:36:35.808 --> 00:36:37.542
Five.

558
00:36:37.543 --> 00:36:39.177
Yeah.

559
00:36:45.668 --> 00:36:47.585
Do you need help
with the Latin?

560
00:36:48.554 --> 00:36:49.787
Sure.

561
00:36:56.729 --> 00:37:00.482
Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits,

562
00:37:00.483 --> 00:37:02.517
Heliocentricity.

563
00:37:04.653 --> 00:37:06.437
Sorry, I don't think
there's anything

564
00:37:06.438 --> 00:37:08.173
That could be
interpreted as a--

565
00:37:08.174 --> 00:37:09.624
Wait, wait, wait.

566
00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:11.959
Do that again.

567
00:37:13.245 --> 00:37:14.578
What is that?

568
00:37:17.416 --> 00:37:20.719
Wait a minute, it's a watermark.
And there's a line of text.

569
00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.753
Go back.

570
00:37:23.973 --> 00:37:25.340
It's in English.

571
00:37:25.341 --> 00:37:28.727
English?
Why English?

572
00:37:28.728 --> 00:37:31.796
English wasn't used in the
Vatican. It was too polluted.

573
00:37:31.797 --> 00:37:34.632
It was free-thinking.
It was a language of radicals

574
00:37:34.633 --> 00:37:37.268
Like Shakespeare
and Chaucer.

575
00:37:37.269 --> 00:37:38.603
Here's another one.

576
00:37:38.604 --> 00:37:41.973
"the path of light
is laid, the sacred test--"

577
00:37:41.974 --> 00:37:43.558
Will you write
this down as I dictate?

578
00:37:43.559 --> 00:37:46.311
Sorry, professor, no time.

579
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.336
Yeah, yeah,
what the hell. Yeah.

580
00:38:09.518 --> 00:38:10.936
Twenty minutes till 8.

581
00:38:10.937 --> 00:38:12.904
Where are we headed?
Hold on, hold on.

582
00:38:12.905 --> 00:38:15.773
I'll tell you in a minute.
Let me see that page again.

583
00:38:21.947 --> 00:38:23.615
Where did you
get that paper?

584
00:38:23.616 --> 00:38:25.450
We borrowed it.

585
00:38:25.451 --> 00:38:28.937
"from Santi's earthly tomb
with demon's hole."

586
00:38:28.938 --> 00:38:30.205
Are you insane?

587
00:38:30.206 --> 00:38:34.075
"'cross Rome the
mystic elements unfold.

588
00:38:34.076 --> 00:38:37.028
"the path of light is
laid, the sacred test.

589
00:38:37.029 --> 00:38:41.249
Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

590
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.170
You removed a document
from the Vatican archives?

591
00:38:45.171 --> 00:38:46.621
She did.

592
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.395
"from Santis
earthly tomb."

593
00:38:53.396 --> 00:38:55.263
The first marker
is at Santis tomb.

594
00:38:55.264 --> 00:38:56.848
Yeah.

595
00:38:56.849 --> 00:38:59.134
But-- but who's Santi?
Raphael.

596
00:38:59.135 --> 00:39:02.153
Il raffaello, the sculptor?
Yeah, Santi was his last name.

597
00:39:02.154 --> 00:39:04.072
So the path starts
at Raphael's tomb.

598
00:39:04.073 --> 00:39:06.441
Raphael's buried
at the pantheon.

599
00:39:06.442 --> 00:39:08.159
Isn't the pantheon
a church?

600
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.778
Oldest Catholic Church
in Rome.

601
00:39:29.715 --> 00:39:33.034
I just pulled a dozen
of our best men for this.

602
00:39:33.035 --> 00:39:34.435
You better be right.

603
00:39:34.436 --> 00:39:36.554
This is one of the busiest spots
in all of Rome.

604
00:39:36.555 --> 00:39:38.490
He'd never get away with it.
It's impossible.

605
00:39:38.491 --> 00:39:41.893
The poem implies--
"the poem"? Unbelievable.

606
00:39:41.894 --> 00:39:44.645
I'm basing this operation on
an American's interpretation

607
00:39:44.646 --> 00:39:47.198
Of a 400-year-old poem.

608
00:39:47.199 --> 00:39:49.967
The information we have clearly
refers to Raphael's tomb.

609
00:39:49.968 --> 00:39:51.953
And Raphael's tomb
is inside that building.

610
00:39:51.954 --> 00:39:54.723
Because the Vatican destroyed
all of the pagan statues

611
00:39:54.724 --> 00:39:57.626
In the late-1800s,
if this is the first marker,

612
00:39:57.627 --> 00:39:59.894
Whatever clues were here
to lead us are gone now.

613
00:39:59.895 --> 00:40:03.331
The path is dead. So this
is it, your only Chance.

614
00:40:05.217 --> 00:40:07.002
Separate approaches.

615
00:40:07.003 --> 00:40:10.755
No closer than two blocks
and no uniforms. Three minutes.

616
00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:12.823
And I need
a set of eyes inside.

617
00:40:16.562 --> 00:40:18.213
Excuse me?

618
00:40:18.214 --> 00:40:20.748
Two weightlifters in matching
black suits and earpieces?

619
00:40:20.749 --> 00:40:22.083
They're hardly disguised.

620
00:40:22.084 --> 00:40:24.085
Well, it's what I have.
Well, fine, I'll go in.

621
00:40:24.086 --> 00:40:27.272
You don't have communication.
You can't carry a walkie-talkie.

622
00:40:27.273 --> 00:40:29.541
Tourists have cell phones.
No, no.

623
00:40:29.542 --> 00:40:31.776
You can't send her
in there alone.

624
00:40:32.778 --> 00:40:34.679
All right, I won't.

625
00:40:46.075 --> 00:40:48.993
Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.

626
00:40:50.546 --> 00:40:52.797
Well, maybe we're not
getting along today.

627
00:40:54.916 --> 00:40:57.652
Hold my hand.

628
00:40:57.653 --> 00:40:59.654
But don't crush it.

629
00:40:59.655 --> 00:41:02.640
Sorry.
A nervous newlywed.

630
00:41:05.427 --> 00:41:08.980
Oh, look.
Look, honey, the oculus.

631
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:10.881
That could be the
"demon's hole" in the poem.

632
00:41:10.882 --> 00:41:12.917
Why are the tombs at an angle?

633
00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:15.620
They're facing east
to worship the rising sun.

634
00:41:15.621 --> 00:41:17.105
But this is a
Christian church.

635
00:41:17.106 --> 00:41:20.208
New religions often adopt the
existing customs and holidays

636
00:41:20.209 --> 00:41:23.027
To make conversion
less of a shock.

637
00:41:23.028 --> 00:41:25.246
Like the
25th of December?

638
00:41:25.247 --> 00:41:27.748
It's the pagan celebration
of the unconquered sun,

639
00:41:27.749 --> 00:41:30.585
And also makes a handy
date for the birth of Christ.

640
00:41:30.586 --> 00:41:32.454
Let's check the recesses.
Okay.

641
00:41:32.455 --> 00:41:35.690
I'll go to the right.
I'll meet you at 180 degrees.

642
00:41:37.726 --> 00:41:39.710
Follow me, please.

643
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:43.364
Now, the pantheon, which means
"temple of all gods",

644
00:41:43.365 --> 00:41:45.900
Was originally
built as a temple

645
00:41:45.901 --> 00:41:48.069
To all the gods of ancient Rome

646
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.355
In 27 B.C.

647
00:41:50.356 --> 00:41:52.524
Although the design
of the building

648
00:41:52.525 --> 00:41:56.194
Is usually credited
to Apollodorus of Damascus...

649
00:41:57.346 --> 00:41:58.929
Robert!

650
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.500
Robert.

651
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:07.037
It's Raphael's tomb.

652
00:42:07.038 --> 00:42:08.673
But it's
the wrong one.

653
00:42:08.674 --> 00:42:11.375
What are you talking about?
He was moved here in 1759,

654
00:42:11.376 --> 00:42:14.212
A century after
"diagramma" was published.

655
00:42:14.213 --> 00:42:15.930
Where was he
originally buried?

656
00:42:15.931 --> 00:42:16.914
Uh... Uh...

657
00:42:16.915 --> 00:42:19.250
Urbino, I think.
"Santis earthly tomb."

658
00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:21.736
What could it possibly be?
"Santis earthly tomb."

659
00:42:23.772 --> 00:42:26.741
Damn it. Santi's tomb.

660
00:42:26.742 --> 00:42:29.060
It must mean
a chapel that he built.

661
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:31.128
He's not buried in it,
he designed it.

662
00:42:31.129 --> 00:42:33.231
The "demon's hole,"
it's not that oculus.

663
00:42:33.232 --> 00:42:35.633
It's an undercroft.
It's a crypt.

664
00:42:35.634 --> 00:42:39.237
- Are there any questions?
- Yes. Yes.

665
00:42:39.238 --> 00:42:42.190
Did Raphael Santi
ever design a chapel

666
00:42:42.191 --> 00:42:44.159
With an ossuary annex
and an Angel figure

667
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.060
Commissioned by
the catholic church?

668
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.964
I'm sorry,
I-I can only think of one.

669
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.468
One is good.

670
00:42:53.469 --> 00:42:56.036
Wrong? What do you mean?
It's the Chigi chapel

671
00:42:56.037 --> 00:42:58.272
In the church of the
Santa Maria del Popolo.

672
00:42:58.273 --> 00:43:00.274
It was once called
the canella della terra,

673
00:43:00.275 --> 00:43:01.709
The chapel of the earth.

674
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:04.078
Earth, the first element.
That's it.

675
00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:05.680
You were certain
about the pantheon.

676
00:43:05.681 --> 00:43:06.981
We have four minutes.

677
00:43:10.686 --> 00:43:12.153
Back to the Vatican?
You can't.

678
00:43:12.154 --> 00:43:14.622
If you care at all about your
church, you'll listen to me.

679
00:43:14.623 --> 00:43:16.707
My church?

680
00:43:17.926 --> 00:43:20.544
My church comforts
the sick and dying.

681
00:43:20.545 --> 00:43:22.113
My church
feeds the hungry.

682
00:43:22.114 --> 00:43:25.849
What does your church do,
Mr. Langdon?

683
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:28.536
That's right,
you don't have one.

684
00:43:29.788 --> 00:43:32.673
Take him if you want.
I'm done with him.

685
00:43:44.854 --> 00:43:46.036
All right,
this makes sense.

686
00:43:46.037 --> 00:43:47.639
Look,
right in front of the church.

687
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.857
An obelisk,
a lofty pyramid.

688
00:43:49.858 --> 00:43:52.944
Egyptian symbol
adopted by the illuminati.

689
00:43:52.945 --> 00:43:56.064
If he's going to kill him,
he'll do it here.

690
00:44:11.997 --> 00:44:13.697
Eight o'clock.

691
00:44:22.424 --> 00:44:24.408
Robert.

692
00:44:43.245 --> 00:44:45.779
No, no, here.
It's an annulus.

693
00:45:13.759 --> 00:45:16.026
Which one
is the Chigi chapel?

694
00:45:16.027 --> 00:45:17.695
It's in one
of these apses.

695
00:45:47.843 --> 00:45:50.611
[man speaking in Italian
over walkie-talkie]

696
00:46:24.263 --> 00:46:27.465
Pyramids
in a Catholic Church.

697
00:46:27.466 --> 00:46:31.402
This is it.
This is the Chigi chapel.

698
00:46:49.271 --> 00:46:50.671
The demon's hole.

699
00:46:54.827 --> 00:46:56.343
But it's askew.

700
00:46:56.344 --> 00:46:58.212
Come here.

701
00:47:03.585 --> 00:47:07.087
Hand me
your flashlight.

702
00:47:07.088 --> 00:47:08.706
What's that?

703
00:48:04.947 --> 00:48:08.766
I call as my witness Christ the Lord,

704
00:48:08.767 --> 00:48:11.819
Who will be my judge,
that my vote is given

705
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.789
To the one before God
I think should be elected.

706
00:48:38.713 --> 00:48:43.784
I elect as the most high
pontiff, Dominic Scolamiero.

707
00:48:54.613 --> 00:48:57.047
I elect as the most
high pontiff,

708
00:48:57.048 --> 00:49:00.284
Edoardo Rossi.

709
00:49:00.285 --> 00:49:03.588
They are voting for themselves
to prevent a majority.

710
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:07.458
They are waiting for the
"preferiti" to be rescued.

711
00:49:07.459 --> 00:49:11.712
Perhaps we should
as well, yes?

712
00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:31.832
Not until the smoke is white

713
00:49:31.833 --> 00:49:35.385
Will the college of cardinals
have chosen a new holy father.

714
00:49:35.386 --> 00:49:39.690
For now, the Vatican seat of
ultimate power remains vacant.

715
00:49:45.329 --> 00:49:48.816
Get the body out of there, and
search the rest of the building.

716
00:49:48.817 --> 00:49:50.651
Chartrand!
Sir?

717
00:49:50.652 --> 00:49:53.588
Outside, a perimeter.
Secure but invisible.

718
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:55.089
No lights, no guns,
nobody knows.

719
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.224
Understand?
Yes, sir.

720
00:49:56.225 --> 00:49:58.275
I'm calling all off-duty.

721
00:49:58.276 --> 00:50:00.861
No information.

722
00:50:00.862 --> 00:50:03.330
Is it Raphael?

723
00:50:03.331 --> 00:50:05.866
The chapel is Raphael.

724
00:50:05.867 --> 00:50:08.585
But the sculptures
are Bernini.

725
00:50:11.206 --> 00:50:15.309
The unknown
illuminati master...

726
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:16.544
Bernini?

727
00:50:17.812 --> 00:50:19.547
He worked
for the church.

728
00:50:19.548 --> 00:50:22.199
Almost exclusively.

729
00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.503
But the illuminati
were infiltrators.

730
00:50:25.504 --> 00:50:27.838
There wasn't
a powerful organization

731
00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:29.339
On earth they
didn't penetrate,

732
00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.692
Including the Vatican
by hiding in plain sight.

733
00:50:36.548 --> 00:50:39.716
<i>Habakkuk and the Angel.</i>

734
00:50:39.717 --> 00:50:42.887
He's the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the earth.

735
00:50:42.888 --> 00:50:47.090
"let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

736
00:50:50.711 --> 00:50:52.847
This is the first marker.

737
00:50:52.848 --> 00:50:54.732
The path is alive.

738
00:51:07.445 --> 00:51:09.330
Southwest.

739
00:51:09.331 --> 00:51:11.365
It was pointing southwest.

740
00:51:11.366 --> 00:51:15.102
Earth, air, fire, water. We're
looking for a Bernini sculpture

741
00:51:15.103 --> 00:51:16.437
Having to do with air.

742
00:51:16.438 --> 00:51:19.373
The second church is
somewhere southwest of here.

743
00:51:19.374 --> 00:51:21.092
You're sure
this time?

744
00:51:21.093 --> 00:51:24.444
I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.

745
00:51:27.449 --> 00:51:29.734
I could use it now.

746
00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:07.120
All right, the purple areas
with these black crosses

747
00:52:07.121 --> 00:52:08.556
Represent
the churches.

748
00:52:08.557 --> 00:52:11.458
But nothing intersects
the line until it hits--

749
00:52:11.459 --> 00:52:12.977
Until it hits St. Peter's.

750
00:52:12.978 --> 00:52:15.445
Michelangelo designed
St. Peter's. Not Bernini.

751
00:52:15.446 --> 00:52:17.398
Michelangelo designed
the basilica.

752
00:52:17.399 --> 00:52:19.200
Bernini designed
St. Peter's square.

753
00:52:19.201 --> 00:52:22.453
The second marker must be
a statue in St. Peter's square.

754
00:52:28.243 --> 00:52:30.494
It's 10 minutes till 9.
Can you go any faster?

755
00:52:30.495 --> 00:52:33.363
Not unless you want the full
attention of the world press.

756
00:52:42.124 --> 00:52:45.992
<i>There was no consensus</i>
<i>after the first ballot,</i>

757
00:52:45.993 --> 00:52:47.694
But Cardinal Baggia,
the Italian,

758
00:52:47.695 --> 00:52:50.430
Is the odds-on
favorite...

759
00:52:50.431 --> 00:52:54.084
there is no new pope,
but it is possible

760
00:52:54.085 --> 00:52:55.853
That Cardinal Guidera,
the Spaniard,

761
00:52:55.854 --> 00:52:58.572
Is the most probable...

762
00:52:58.573 --> 00:53:02.960
it is possible that Cardinal Ebner,
from Germany,

763
00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:06.329
Is the favorite...

764
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:09.533
Stem cell research is murder!

765
00:53:09.534 --> 00:53:12.586
You're condemning
sick people to die.

766
00:53:12.587 --> 00:53:14.455
Man is not God.

767
00:53:26.868 --> 00:53:28.702
There, another obelisk.

768
00:53:28.703 --> 00:53:32.006
Check the crowd. It's almost 9.
He's gotta be here already.

769
00:54:07.142 --> 00:54:09.844
There must be
100 statues up there.

770
00:54:09.845 --> 00:54:13.097
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

771
00:54:13.098 --> 00:54:15.165
How in God's name
would anyone create

772
00:54:15.166 --> 00:54:17.734
A sculpture about air?

773
00:54:25.243 --> 00:54:28.645
Bas-relief. Of course.
It's still a sculpture.

774
00:54:28.646 --> 00:54:31.582
Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.

775
00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:34.451
Look for another having
something to do with air.

776
00:54:54.856 --> 00:54:58.142
"west ponente." west wind.

777
00:54:58.143 --> 00:54:59.894
Vittoria!

778
00:54:59.895 --> 00:55:02.646
Here it is.

779
00:55:02.647 --> 00:55:05.733
West wind. An Angel
blowing out five streaks of air.

780
00:55:05.734 --> 00:55:07.234
This is it.

781
00:56:10.181 --> 00:56:13.067
Get the police!

782
00:56:14.052 --> 00:56:15.785
Call an ambulance!

783
00:56:25.379 --> 00:56:26.680
He's still alive.

784
00:56:41.129 --> 00:56:44.832
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

785
00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.315
Clear the square.

786
00:58:04.345 --> 00:58:06.130
"--from within your walls

787
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:07.731
To squeeze life
from the bishop."

788
00:58:07.732 --> 00:58:09.299
He's actually claiming
responsibility

789
00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.168
For the death
of his holiness.

790
00:58:11.169 --> 00:58:13.604
That's ridiculous.
He died of a stroke.

791
00:58:13.605 --> 00:58:15.422
It implies the
illuminati murdered him

792
00:58:15.423 --> 00:58:16.990
With his
own medication.

793
00:58:16.991 --> 00:58:19.309
What?

794
00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:20.477
Down here.

795
00:58:20.478 --> 00:58:24.264
"with man's solution
we stilled his heart.

796
00:58:24.265 --> 00:58:28.051
With his own needle did
we Pierce his unholy veil."

797
00:58:28.052 --> 00:58:30.920
Did the holy father take
any kind of medication

798
00:58:30.921 --> 00:58:31.988
By injection?

799
00:58:31.989 --> 00:58:33.907
Tinzaparin.

800
00:58:33.908 --> 00:58:35.743
He had
thrombophlebitis.

801
00:58:35.744 --> 00:58:39.163
He took an injection every day.
But no one knew that.

802
00:58:39.164 --> 00:58:40.531
Someone knew.

803
00:58:40.532 --> 00:58:43.917
Well, he had health
concerns and seizures as well.

804
00:58:43.918 --> 00:58:47.587
But he took steps to make sure
he was watched, for safety.

805
00:58:47.588 --> 00:58:50.791
He didn't want it made public so
we have no reason to discuss it.

806
00:58:50.792 --> 00:58:53.360
Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.

807
00:58:53.361 --> 00:58:56.129
An overdose could cause
massive internal bleeding

808
00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:57.381
And brain hemorrhages.

809
00:58:57.382 --> 00:58:59.349
It might look like
a stroke at first,

810
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:01.301
But in a few days his
body would show signs.

811
00:59:01.302 --> 00:59:02.953
This could easily
be examined.

812
00:59:02.954 --> 00:59:04.805
Miss Vetra, in case you're
not aware of it,

813
00:59:04.806 --> 00:59:08.358
Papal autopsy is
prohibited by Vatican law.

814
00:59:08.359 --> 00:59:10.811
We're not going to defile
his holiness's body

815
00:59:10.812 --> 00:59:12.646
Just because his
enemies claim--

816
00:59:12.647 --> 00:59:14.164
Why would they
send this letter now?

817
00:59:14.165 --> 00:59:15.899
Well, to cause panic.

818
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.301
"the sun will blind
at midnight,

819
00:59:18.302 --> 00:59:21.155
And neither police nor
professors can stop it."

820
00:59:21.156 --> 00:59:22.906
He knows I'm here.

821
00:59:22.907 --> 00:59:26.209
Obviously they were hoping
this letter would become public.

822
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.328
We might be wise
to pre-empt their next attempt

823
00:59:28.329 --> 00:59:31.665
By making an announcement of our
own to refute this absurd claim.

824
00:59:31.666 --> 00:59:33.367
That's out
of the question.

825
00:59:33.368 --> 00:59:34.734
Cardinal Strauss
has insisted

826
00:59:34.735 --> 00:59:36.670
This entire matter
be kept internal.

827
00:59:36.671 --> 00:59:39.056
He shouldn't even be aware
of it. He's in conclave.

828
00:59:39.057 --> 00:59:40.223
His final instructions

829
00:59:40.224 --> 00:59:43.177
Before sealing the doors
were very clear.

830
00:59:43.178 --> 00:59:46.396
Cardinal Strauss does not
dictate Vatican protocols.

831
00:59:46.397 --> 00:59:48.599
As you say,
yet, technically,

832
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.584
Now that
conclave has begun,

833
00:59:50.585 --> 00:59:53.854
It's his privilege and duty
to control public announcements.

834
00:59:53.855 --> 00:59:56.706
I've drafted a release about
the incident in the piazza,

835
00:59:56.707 --> 01:00:00.577
But any other statements
are specifically prohibited.

836
01:00:00.578 --> 01:00:02.629
For that, cardinal has asked me

837
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:05.232
To remind you we have a chimney.

838
01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:11.588
Commander Richter,
the search for the device?

839
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:14.307
Well, we've turned
the power on and off

840
01:00:14.308 --> 01:00:15.959
To about 20 percent
of Vatican city.

841
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.594
Nothing on the video yet.
We're running out of options.

842
01:00:18.595 --> 01:00:20.848
How long would you
need to evacuate everyone?

843
01:00:20.849 --> 01:00:24.017
If I pull all my men from the
search for the bomb, 30 minutes.

844
01:00:25.803 --> 01:00:28.355
Mr. Langdon. You have been
right so far about the path.

845
01:00:28.356 --> 01:00:30.140
It's now 9:15.

846
01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:32.442
How quickly can you
find the next church?

847
01:00:32.443 --> 01:00:36.046
The lines on the carving pointed
east, away from Vatican city.

848
01:00:36.047 --> 01:00:38.598
But there were five of them,
so there's room for error.

849
01:00:38.599 --> 01:00:41.151
About 20 churches
intersect those lines.

850
01:00:41.152 --> 01:00:43.704
None of them have names
that invoke fire.

851
01:00:43.705 --> 01:00:46.055
So a Bernini sculpture must be
inside one of them that does.

852
01:00:46.056 --> 01:00:48.191
We'll need to get into
the archives to find it.

853
01:00:48.192 --> 01:00:51.194
Would you escort Mr. Langdon?
Yes, father.

854
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:55.082
Silvano's
journals.

855
01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:57.834
The killer's name could
be in here. May I stay?

856
01:00:57.835 --> 01:00:59.986
Please.
Fine, of course.

857
01:01:01.289 --> 01:01:04.224
Professor.

858
01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:07.894
Would it surprise you to
find those clothes suit you?

859
01:01:07.895 --> 01:01:10.380
It would surprise
the hell out of me.

860
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:27.464
the Vatican is expressing sympathy

861
01:01:27.465 --> 01:01:30.900
For the mugging victim

862
01:01:30.901 --> 01:01:35.322
A Dusseldorf tourist,
now confirmed dead...

863
01:01:35.323 --> 01:01:40.009
the Vatican police have
a suspect in custody...

864
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:45.015
the Vatican will allow the crowd

865
01:01:45.016 --> 01:01:47.167
Back into St. Peter's square,

866
01:01:47.168 --> 01:01:48.802
Where security
will be doubled...

867
01:01:48.803 --> 01:01:51.571
the Vatican did admit
that where there are crowds,

868
01:01:51.572 --> 01:01:53.607
So often follows crime.

869
01:01:53.608 --> 01:01:56.393
We're trying now to get the
name of the tourist who was--

870
01:01:56.394 --> 01:01:59.095
Oh, wait.

871
01:01:59.096 --> 01:02:01.281
We're getting
word now of smoke.

872
01:02:01.282 --> 01:02:03.767
<i>Smoke from the</i>
<i>Sistine chapel chimney.</i>

873
01:02:03.768 --> 01:02:06.203
<i>Apparently there's</i>
<i>been another vote.</i>

874
01:02:06.204 --> 01:02:08.054
<i>The smoke is black.</i>

875
01:02:08.055 --> 01:02:10.923
<i>Once again, the cardinals have</i>
<i>failed to reach consensus,</i>

876
01:02:10.924 --> 01:02:13.527
<i>And the catholic church</i>
<i>remains without a leader.</i>

877
01:02:22.019 --> 01:02:24.855
What are you
looking for now?

878
01:02:24.856 --> 01:02:26.623
Church assets.

879
01:02:26.624 --> 01:02:28.324
I beg your pardon?

880
01:02:28.325 --> 01:02:30.460
Artwork.
It's valuable.

881
01:02:30.461 --> 01:02:33.764
Corporations tend to keep
track of their holdings.

882
01:02:33.765 --> 01:02:37.734
The catholic church is not
a corporation, it's a beacon.

883
01:02:37.735 --> 01:02:39.218
A source
of inspiration

884
01:02:39.219 --> 01:02:41.354
For one billion lost
and frightened souls.

885
01:02:41.355 --> 01:02:44.390
Sure, I get that.
It's also a bank.

886
01:02:54.768 --> 01:02:56.536
Commander Olivetti
said I was not to

887
01:02:56.537 --> 01:02:58.505
Leave your
side this time.

888
01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:02.141
It wasn't me,
it was her.

889
01:03:20.611 --> 01:03:22.946
power is now cut to zone 73.

890
01:03:22.947 --> 01:03:25.348
No light reaction
on the monitor.

891
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:29.018
Restore power
and move on to 74.

892
01:03:39.363 --> 01:03:40.664
What sort of signs?

893
01:03:42.232 --> 01:03:43.950
I'm sorry?

894
01:03:47.338 --> 01:03:52.142
If the holy father was given
an overdose of tinzaparin,

895
01:03:52.143 --> 01:03:54.177
What signs would
his body bear?

896
01:03:55.963 --> 01:03:57.981
Bleeding of
the oral mucosa.

897
01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.901
His tongue.

898
01:04:00.902 --> 01:04:02.852
Post-mortem,
the blood congeals

899
01:04:02.853 --> 01:04:04.988
And turns the inside
of the mouth black.

900
01:04:07.191 --> 01:04:09.409
Even after 14 days?

901
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:12.495
It wouldn't show up until
at least a week after his death.

902
01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:20.871
He was very important to me.

903
01:04:20.872 --> 01:04:23.990
Yeah,
I understand.

904
01:04:28.395 --> 01:04:29.963
Will you come with me,
please?

905
01:04:37.388 --> 01:04:40.640
"Signore", would you
organize a security team

906
01:04:40.641 --> 01:04:42.625
To escort Miss Vetra and myself
down to the crypt?

907
01:04:42.626 --> 01:04:45.711
Yes, sir.
We'll be leaving straightaway.

908
01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:05.582
Do you smoke?

909
01:05:07.401 --> 01:05:09.436
A little bit.

910
01:05:09.437 --> 01:05:12.388
Then you better sit down
before you keel over.

911
01:05:15.226 --> 01:05:17.176
And what's all that right there?

912
01:05:18.546 --> 01:05:21.314
What does this say
in Italian right here,

913
01:05:21.315 --> 01:05:23.816
Next to the <i>ecstasy of saint</i>
<i>Teresa? Right there.</i>

914
01:05:26.604 --> 01:05:29.889
"moved at suggestion
of the artist."

915
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:33.660
"moved"? To another church.
At the suggestion of Bernini?

916
01:05:33.661 --> 01:05:35.762
I don't know.

917
01:05:37.164 --> 01:05:40.333
Here. Translate
all of this for me,

918
01:05:40.334 --> 01:05:42.035
And I'll buy you
a pack of smokes.

919
01:05:42.036 --> 01:05:44.421
I'm looking for
a reference to fire.

920
01:05:44.422 --> 01:05:46.188
Fires.

921
01:05:47.408 --> 01:05:49.643
"seraphim," meaning
"the fiery one."

922
01:05:49.644 --> 01:05:51.761
Right.

923
01:05:51.762 --> 01:05:54.864
his great, golden spear,

924
01:05:54.865 --> 01:05:56.666
A point of fire."

925
01:05:58.553 --> 01:06:02.471
Then "woman left
completely afire."

926
01:06:02.472 --> 01:06:06.977
<i>Ecstasy of saint Teresa.</i>
Saint Teresa on fire.

927
01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:08.761
So this sculpture
was moved to this church?

928
01:06:11.148 --> 01:06:12.882
Why did they shut down the system?

929
01:06:12.883 --> 01:06:14.667
They know we're down here.

930
01:06:14.668 --> 01:06:19.005
If there's no power,
there's no oxygen.

931
01:06:19.006 --> 01:06:22.358
Can we get out?
The door is electronic.

932
01:06:23.294 --> 01:06:25.278
Oh, God.

933
01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:27.213
Well, that's disappointing.

934
01:06:28.815 --> 01:06:30.182
Where are we going?

935
01:06:30.183 --> 01:06:32.385
To see my father.

936
01:06:32.386 --> 01:06:33.670
I don't understand.

937
01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:36.756
I was orphaned when
I was 9 years of age.

938
01:06:36.757 --> 01:06:38.058
A bombing in Ulster.

939
01:06:38.059 --> 01:06:41.461
The UVF protesting the visit
of a catholic archbishop.

940
01:06:41.462 --> 01:06:43.563
The archbishop felt responsible,

941
01:06:43.564 --> 01:06:46.315
And he adopted me
the following day.

942
01:06:46.316 --> 01:06:49.585
I was raised by him
and by the church.

943
01:06:49.586 --> 01:06:52.321
He was the wisest
man I ever met.

944
01:06:52.322 --> 01:06:54.356
Even when I was
young and stubborn,

945
01:06:54.357 --> 01:06:56.192
I wanted to be ordained.

946
01:06:56.193 --> 01:06:57.593
But I was brought up in Italy,

947
01:06:57.594 --> 01:07:00.029
So I also wanted to
do my military service.

948
01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:01.998
I wanted to fight.

949
01:07:01.999 --> 01:07:05.551
He told me,
"learn to fly."

950
01:07:05.552 --> 01:07:07.920
So I joined the
<i>aeronautica militare,</i>

951
01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:11.857
Flew helicopters, bringing
the wounded back to hospital.

952
01:07:11.858 --> 01:07:13.260
He was a great man.

953
01:07:13.261 --> 01:07:16.229
Your father died?

954
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:19.215
Fourteen days ago.

955
01:07:19.216 --> 01:07:21.350
command, do you read me?

956
01:07:21.351 --> 01:07:24.521
Power is off.
Oxygen is very low.

957
01:07:24.522 --> 01:07:26.573
Come in.
Can you read me?

958
01:07:26.574 --> 01:07:27.840
Can you get anything?

959
01:07:27.841 --> 01:07:32.111
No. The walls are lead-lined.
There's no signal.

960
01:10:54.715 --> 01:10:56.415
This way.

961
01:11:04.692 --> 01:11:09.028
If the holy father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

962
01:11:09.029 --> 01:11:11.530
Vatican security is impenetrable.

963
01:11:11.531 --> 01:11:14.567
No one from the outside could
have got anywhere near him.

964
01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:16.435
It was someone on the inside.

965
01:11:16.436 --> 01:11:19.572
And we can trust no one.

966
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:24.344
No light reaction on zone 97.

967
01:11:24.345 --> 01:11:28.664
Based on the rate the battery
is using power,

968
01:11:28.665 --> 01:11:31.784
The device will detonate
just before midnight.

969
01:11:53.774 --> 01:11:56.409
Holy father...

970
01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:57.844
When I was young, you told me

971
01:11:57.845 --> 01:12:00.330
The voice in my
heart was God's voice.

972
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:03.550
You said I should follow it,
no matter how painful.

973
01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:06.135
Forgive me.

974
01:12:06.136 --> 01:12:07.353
Please.

975
01:12:07.354 --> 01:12:09.389
Give me strength.

976
01:12:10.524 --> 01:12:12.358
What I do,

977
01:12:12.359 --> 01:12:15.694
I do in the name
of everything you believe.

978
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:09.448
God help us.

979
01:13:22.329 --> 01:13:25.314
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

980
01:13:25.315 --> 01:13:28.650
Yes, I do.
It's the next church.

981
01:13:44.685 --> 01:13:46.903
I think someone
just tried to kill me.

982
01:13:46.904 --> 01:13:49.588
I promise you we had no idea--
he knows I'm here.

983
01:13:49.589 --> 01:13:51.290
Yes.
You heard me ask permission.

984
01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:53.158
You gave me an escort.
Yes, but we had no idea

985
01:13:53.159 --> 01:13:54.676
That portions
of our white zones

986
01:13:54.677 --> 01:13:57.780
Were cross-wired
with that building.

987
01:13:57.781 --> 01:13:59.582
Commander Richter
was extending the search.

988
01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:01.534
If he had known the archives
were on that grid,,

989
01:14:01.535 --> 01:14:04.353
He never would have
killed the power.

990
01:14:04.354 --> 01:14:06.822
Or there is the
other possibility.

991
01:14:06.823 --> 01:14:10.259
Is it conceivable
the illuminati...

992
01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.428
Have infiltrated
the Swiss guard?

993
01:14:15.682 --> 01:14:17.783
Perhaps.

994
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:28.961
The journals.
Where are they?

995
01:14:31.949 --> 01:14:34.466
Who took the journals
from this desk?

996
01:14:41.959 --> 01:14:44.409
- Someone is here?
- What is this?

997
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.547
<i>Signore,</i>
this is unacceptable.

998
01:14:47.548 --> 01:14:49.715
For a camerlengo
to enter the chapel

999
01:14:49.716 --> 01:14:51.316
Once conclave
has begun...

1000
01:14:51.317 --> 01:14:54.637
Forgive me.
There's been a development.

1001
01:15:05.232 --> 01:15:07.967
his holiness Celestine V
was murdered.

1002
01:15:07.968 --> 01:15:12.054
Is it so hard to believe
it could happen again?

1003
01:15:12.055 --> 01:15:14.273
<i>Signori,</i>
please a moment.

1004
01:15:14.274 --> 01:15:17.676
Please, <i>signori.</i>

1005
01:15:17.677 --> 01:15:21.814
Our church is at war.

1006
01:15:21.815 --> 01:15:25.451
We are under attack
from an old enemy.

1007
01:15:25.452 --> 01:15:27.753
The illuminati.

1008
01:15:27.754 --> 01:15:29.872
They have struck us from within.

1009
01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:32.592
Murdering our holy father.

1010
01:15:32.593 --> 01:15:34.543
And threatening us
all with destruction

1011
01:15:34.544 --> 01:15:37.597
At the hands
of their new God, science.

1012
01:15:37.598 --> 01:15:40.883
They call it retribution.
They think it justified.

1013
01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:43.920
Because of the church's attacks
on men of science in the past.

1014
01:15:43.921 --> 01:15:45.888
And it's true.

1015
01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:47.606
Since the days of Galileo

1016
01:15:47.607 --> 01:15:49.976
This church has tried
to slow the relentless

1017
01:15:49.977 --> 01:15:51.577
March of progress,

1018
01:15:51.578 --> 01:15:54.046
Sometimes with misguided means.

1019
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:59.185
But science and religion
are not enemies.

1020
01:15:59.186 --> 01:16:01.020
There are simply some things

1021
01:16:01.021 --> 01:16:04.240
That science is just too young
to understand.

1022
01:16:04.241 --> 01:16:06.959
So the church pleads, "stop.

1023
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.662
Slow down. Think. Wait."

1024
01:16:09.663 --> 01:16:12.915
And for this they call us backward.

1025
01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:15.201
But who is more ignorant,

1026
01:16:15.202 --> 01:16:17.670
The man who cannot
define lightning,

1027
01:16:17.671 --> 01:16:19.021
Or the man who does not respect

1028
01:16:19.022 --> 01:16:21.891
Its natural awesome power?

1029
01:16:21.892 --> 01:16:24.977
The battle is well underway,
<i>signori.</i>

1030
01:16:24.978 --> 01:16:27.162
We must defend ourselves.

1031
01:16:27.163 --> 01:16:30.566
But what if this time we fight
their stealth with openness?

1032
01:16:30.567 --> 01:16:33.236
Combat their wicked scheme
with simple truth,

1033
01:16:33.237 --> 01:16:36.188
And end this brutish
battle once and for all.

1034
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:39.575
If the outside world could
see this church as I do,

1035
01:16:39.576 --> 01:16:41.811
Looking beyond the ritual
of these walls,

1036
01:16:41.812 --> 01:16:45.448
They would see a modern Miracle.

1037
01:16:45.449 --> 01:16:48.784
A brotherhood of imperfect,
simple souls,

1038
01:16:48.785 --> 01:16:51.420
Who want nothing more than
to be voices of compassion

1039
01:16:51.421 --> 01:16:54.857
In a world spinning out of control.

1040
01:16:55.993 --> 01:17:00.362
"Signori", I ask...

1041
01:17:00.363 --> 01:17:02.698
I pray...

1042
01:17:02.699 --> 01:17:05.434
That you break this conclave.

1043
01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:08.353
Open the doors,

1044
01:17:08.354 --> 01:17:10.956
Evacuate St. Peter's square,

1045
01:17:10.957 --> 01:17:14.059
And tell the world the truth.

1046
01:17:47.577 --> 01:17:49.478
oh, my God.

1047
01:17:49.479 --> 01:17:50.713
Get him down!

1048
01:17:52.933 --> 01:17:55.217
No!

1049
01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:05.477
There, there, that chain.
On that pulley.

1050
01:18:05.478 --> 01:18:08.397
This bench. Get this pew
up here. Make a ladder.

1051
01:18:08.398 --> 01:18:11.500


1052
01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:35.401
<i>Gendarmeria vaticana.</i>

1053
01:19:44.177 --> 01:19:45.661
Oh!

1054
01:20:39.849 --> 01:20:41.216
My son...

1055
01:20:42.602 --> 01:20:46.688
God answers all prayers, but...

1056
01:20:46.689 --> 01:20:48.823
Sometimes his answer is no.

1057
01:20:50.777 --> 01:20:53.612
The college will
not break conclave.

1058
01:20:54.748 --> 01:20:56.248
May I suggest

1059
01:20:56.249 --> 01:20:58.366
You direct your energies

1060
01:20:58.367 --> 01:21:02.505
To helping the Swiss guard
find this explosive device,

1061
01:21:02.506 --> 01:21:05.690
If it exists.

1062
01:21:05.691 --> 01:21:07.492
And leave
church leadership...

1063
01:21:09.762 --> 01:21:11.663
To its leaders.

1064
01:21:24.527 --> 01:21:25.994
Eminence.

1065
01:21:28.482 --> 01:21:32.952
There is a growing fear
that without the four <i>preferiti,</i>

1066
01:21:32.953 --> 01:21:36.621
A two-thirds majority
for any candidate

1067
01:21:36.622 --> 01:21:38.657
Will not be possible.

1068
01:21:38.658 --> 01:21:42.528
Unless--
speak plainly.

1069
01:21:42.529 --> 01:21:44.479
It is the recommendation of many

1070
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.982
That you ask to be
removed from your post

1071
01:21:46.983 --> 01:21:49.034
As great elector,

1072
01:21:49.035 --> 01:21:52.854
Thereby making
yourself eligible

1073
01:21:52.855 --> 01:21:57.058
To wear the
ring of the fisherman.

1074
01:21:57.059 --> 01:21:59.127
Well...

1075
01:21:59.128 --> 01:22:01.796
If it is God's will...

1076
01:22:08.688 --> 01:22:10.723
May His will be done.

1077
01:22:38.702 --> 01:22:41.203
<i>Signore,</i>
Are you okay?

1078
01:23:05.745 --> 01:23:07.646
Those journals are
private property.

1079
01:23:07.647 --> 01:23:09.381
I demand that you
return them to me.

1080
01:23:09.382 --> 01:23:13.518
They're material evidence
in a Vatican investigation.

1081
01:23:14.887 --> 01:23:17.322
I am an Italian citizen.
My rights do not end

1082
01:23:17.323 --> 01:23:18.957
Just because I
crossed to the other--

1083
01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:20.342
This is not Italy.

1084
01:23:20.343 --> 01:23:22.260
It's not even Rome,
it's the Vatican.

1085
01:23:22.261 --> 01:23:24.379
A country of its own
with its own laws.

1086
01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.414
And when those journals
passed the border,

1087
01:23:26.415 --> 01:23:27.883
They became my property.

1088
01:23:27.884 --> 01:23:29.852
I will give them back to you

1089
01:23:29.853 --> 01:23:32.087
When I've decided they
contain nothing of value

1090
01:23:32.088 --> 01:23:33.489
To the investigation.

1091
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:35.991
Do you have something
to hide, "comandante" Richter?

1092
01:23:38.912 --> 01:23:41.346
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

1093
01:24:02.519 --> 01:24:05.870
Were it up to me,
it would not be this way.

1094
01:24:07.473 --> 01:24:10.776
It's a sin to kill with pain.

1095
01:24:10.777 --> 01:24:13.378
It's a sin to kill without reason.

1096
01:24:16.966 --> 01:24:19.067
Father...

1097
01:24:20.153 --> 01:24:21.904
They make me a sinner.

1098
01:24:41.458 --> 01:24:44.376
Saint Teresa on fire.

1099
01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.914
Professor Langdon?

1100
01:24:50.016 --> 01:24:52.318
What direction is that?
West, I think.

1101
01:24:52.319 --> 01:24:56.021
"'cross Rome the mystic
elements unfold."

1102
01:24:56.022 --> 01:24:58.824
Piazza Barberini is here.

1103
01:24:58.825 --> 01:25:02.111
Saint Teresa is here.

1104
01:25:02.112 --> 01:25:04.863
Where is the Santa Maria del
popolo, first altar of science?

1105
01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:08.383
Santa Maria del popolo?
Yes.

1106
01:25:08.384 --> 01:25:10.602
Thank you.

1107
01:25:10.603 --> 01:25:12.938
St. Peter's is here.

1108
01:25:12.939 --> 01:25:15.324
We are here.

1109
01:25:16.626 --> 01:25:18.460
A church with water...

1110
01:25:20.413 --> 01:25:23.182
Wait, wait, wait.

1111
01:25:23.183 --> 01:25:24.399
"'cross Rome."

1112
01:25:26.135 --> 01:25:28.420
The poem must mean it
literally, cross Rome.

1113
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:30.889
Professor, commander
Richter has ordered me

1114
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:32.307
To escort you to the Vatican.

1115
01:25:32.308 --> 01:25:34.143
Piazza navona.

1116
01:25:34.144 --> 01:25:37.896
Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

1117
01:25:37.897 --> 01:25:40.065
Cross Rome.

1118
01:25:40.066 --> 01:25:43.035
Bernini's <i>four rivers.</i>

1119
01:25:43.036 --> 01:25:45.153
Professor Langdon,
the Vatican insists

1120
01:25:45.154 --> 01:25:46.405
That I have to take you back.

1121
01:25:46.406 --> 01:25:47.639
The Vatican is about to see

1122
01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.424
Its fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

1123
01:25:49.425 --> 01:25:53.028
Now, look.
You can do as they say

1124
01:25:53.029 --> 01:25:54.913
And force me back to the Vatican,

1125
01:25:54.914 --> 01:25:56.965
Where we can all mourn
his death together.

1126
01:25:56.966 --> 01:25:59.518
Or you can show
how real cops act,

1127
01:25:59.519 --> 01:26:01.136
And take me to the
piazza navona,

1128
01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:04.339
Where we still might
be able to stop it.

1129
01:26:07.343 --> 01:26:10.179
Oh, by all means,
let's talk it over.

1130
01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:12.781
In 14 minutes,
he's gonna be dead.

1131
01:26:18.621 --> 01:26:19.922
This way,
professor.

1132
01:26:27.747 --> 01:26:30.582
Yes, padre?

1133
01:26:30.583 --> 01:26:34.369
At 11:15, if the church
is still in peril,

1134
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:37.756
Give the order
to evacuate the cardinals.

1135
01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:40.041
But with dignity.

1136
01:26:40.042 --> 01:26:42.010
Let them walk out into
St. Peter's square

1137
01:26:42.011 --> 01:26:44.212
With their heads held high.

1138
01:26:44.213 --> 01:26:46.248
I don't want the last image
of this church to be

1139
01:26:46.249 --> 01:26:49.468
Of frightened old men
sneaking out the back door.

1140
01:27:06.418 --> 01:27:08.386
"let angels guide thee..."

1141
01:27:13.409 --> 01:27:15.543
There it is.

1142
01:27:15.544 --> 01:27:17.863
There it is.
Professor, I know this fountain.

1143
01:27:17.864 --> 01:27:21.449
There is no Angel on it.
The dove. The Angel of peace.

1144
01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:23.785
And it's looking in what direction?

1145
01:27:23.786 --> 01:27:26.487
Uh, east, I think.

1146
01:27:37.199 --> 01:27:38.684
Professor,
just wait here.

1147
01:27:38.685 --> 01:27:40.868
Stay put.

1148
01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:19.775
good evening. Can you help me?

1149
01:28:19.776 --> 01:28:22.311
I'm waiting for a doctor.

1150
01:28:38.627 --> 01:28:40.612
come here.

1151
01:28:43.248 --> 01:28:46.484
Stay calm.
Don't shoot.

1152
01:29:23.373 --> 01:29:24.472
Hey!

1153
01:29:39.054 --> 01:29:40.689
Help!

1154
01:29:40.690 --> 01:29:41.923
Somebody help!

1155
01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:22.881
Help, somebody!

1156
01:31:36.923 --> 01:31:38.573
Cardinal Baggia?

1157
01:31:38.574 --> 01:31:40.041
Cardinal Baggia.

1158
01:31:41.928 --> 01:31:44.429
Where was he hiding you?

1159
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:46.765
The church of illumination,
where is it?

1160
01:31:46.766 --> 01:31:50.518
Castel-- Castel sant'angelo.

1161
01:31:51.971 --> 01:31:53.538
Castle of the Angel.

1162
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:19.765
Sir, there's news
about cardinal Baggia.

1163
01:32:19.766 --> 01:32:21.767
The cardinal told Langdon
he was being held

1164
01:32:21.768 --> 01:32:23.601
In Castel sant'angelo.

1165
01:32:23.602 --> 01:32:26.571
If Langdons right,
that's where the bomb is.

1166
01:32:26.572 --> 01:32:28.056
Send everyone we can spare.

1167
01:32:28.057 --> 01:32:29.891
And you?

1168
01:32:29.892 --> 01:32:31.692
I'm staying here.

1169
01:32:44.807 --> 01:32:47.325
Vittoria.

1170
01:32:47.326 --> 01:32:48.860
You're all right.
I'm all right.

1171
01:32:48.861 --> 01:32:50.779
What about you?
I just heard about Olivetti.

1172
01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:52.380
I'm all right,
I'm okay.

1173
01:32:58.054 --> 01:33:01.639
Robert, we can't trust Richter.
He took Silvanos journals.

1174
01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.226
There must be something in
there he doesn't want us to see.

1175
01:33:04.227 --> 01:33:07.562
The head of the Swiss guard.

1176
01:33:07.563 --> 01:33:09.815
Castel sant'angelo,
it's close enough,

1177
01:33:09.816 --> 01:33:11.382
So the wireless signal
from that camera

1178
01:33:11.383 --> 01:33:13.018
Could still
reach the Vatican.

1179
01:33:14.904 --> 01:33:17.856
The church of illumination
is somewhere here.

1180
01:33:17.857 --> 01:33:20.475
Your canister is inside it.

1181
01:33:40.546 --> 01:33:41.863
Come with me.

1182
01:33:45.734 --> 01:33:47.919
For 400 years,
the illuminati met

1183
01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.855
Right under the church's nose.

1184
01:33:49.856 --> 01:33:51.106
The Vatican used
this as a hideout

1185
01:33:51.107 --> 01:33:53.475
And as a prison for their enemies.

1186
01:33:53.476 --> 01:33:55.777
If the explosion happens here,

1187
01:33:55.778 --> 01:33:58.313
Would the blast radius
take out the Vatican?

1188
01:33:58.314 --> 01:34:00.214
And part of Rome along with it.

1189
01:34:02.434 --> 01:34:04.635
Go on.

1190
01:34:18.467 --> 01:34:20.785
They're pointing to it.
The angels.

1191
01:34:20.786 --> 01:34:23.438
The canister must be down there.
Come on.

1192
01:35:10.603 --> 01:35:13.555
Where are they going?
To search the outer castle.

1193
01:35:13.556 --> 01:35:15.957
No, no. It has to be here!

1194
01:35:21.147 --> 01:35:22.914
Robert, it's a dead end.

1195
01:35:22.915 --> 01:35:25.150
No, it's not.

1196
01:35:25.151 --> 01:35:27.568
See if you can find a flashlight.

1197
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.005
All of these stones
are rectangular granite.

1198
01:35:47.006 --> 01:35:49.958
Except right here.
What is this?

1199
01:35:53.596 --> 01:35:55.246
It's a pentagram.

1200
01:35:55.247 --> 01:35:57.248
An eye...

1201
01:35:57.249 --> 01:35:58.999
That leads to...

1202
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.735
Nowhere.

1203
01:36:09.829 --> 01:36:10.928
Robert?

1204
01:36:12.798 --> 01:36:15.600
These walls overlap and there's
a passageway back here.

1205
01:36:15.601 --> 01:36:17.101
Here, let me
have the flashlight.

1206
01:36:40.842 --> 01:36:44.111
It's a passageway
that leads to the Vatican.

1207
01:36:44.112 --> 01:36:45.747
An ancient escape route.

1208
01:36:48.434 --> 01:36:49.583
My God.

1209
01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.320
Here.

1210
01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:57.825
Look.

1211
01:37:19.849 --> 01:37:22.517
<i>This would be the perfect</i>
<i>place for the illuminati</i>

1212
01:37:22.518 --> 01:37:24.285
<i>To blow the</i>
<i>whole building up.</i>

1213
01:37:30.443 --> 01:37:33.328
Get on the radio.
Get the word out.

1214
01:37:33.329 --> 01:37:34.896
Conclave remains sealed.

1215
01:37:34.897 --> 01:37:37.498
But the camerlengo gave
the order for evacuation at--

1216
01:37:37.499 --> 01:37:39.433
I'm countermanding it.

1217
01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:46.974
This is it.
This is their church.

1218
01:37:49.427 --> 01:37:52.530
The canister should be
lit by artificial light.

1219
01:38:15.771 --> 01:38:17.538
It's not here, Robert.

1220
01:38:17.539 --> 01:38:20.241
"a shining star at the end
of the path." it has to be.

1221
01:38:20.242 --> 01:38:22.544
It's not here.

1222
01:38:22.545 --> 01:38:24.245
What did the poem say?
Nothing.

1223
01:38:24.246 --> 01:38:25.829
Nothing, it's all over.

1224
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:29.968
It was just the four lines,
each one describing the--

1225
01:38:39.244 --> 01:38:40.762
There's a fifth brand.

1226
01:38:40.763 --> 01:38:43.514
It's not an ambigram,
it's just two crossed keys.

1227
01:38:43.515 --> 01:38:47.135
The symbol for the Vatican.
No.

1228
01:38:47.136 --> 01:38:48.736
No, the papacy.

1229
01:38:48.737 --> 01:38:50.305
They intend to kill him.

1230
01:38:50.306 --> 01:38:53.341
Before they destroy the Vatican,
they're gonna kill

1231
01:38:53.342 --> 01:38:55.910
And brand the pope himself.
There is no pope.

1232
01:38:55.911 --> 01:38:57.745
<i>Tempe sede vacante.</i>

1233
01:38:57.746 --> 01:38:59.747
"Il camerlengo".

1234
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:05.420
We have to warn him.
Take a step back, please.

1235
01:39:05.421 --> 01:39:08.339
Take your cell phone
from your pocket.

1236
01:39:11.276 --> 01:39:12.844
Throw it in the fire.

1237
01:39:23.656 --> 01:39:25.489
Murderer.

1238
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:28.226
You know, when they call me...

1239
01:39:28.227 --> 01:39:29.827
And they all call me...

1240
01:39:29.828 --> 01:39:33.031
It is so important
to them that I know

1241
01:39:33.032 --> 01:39:35.833
That what they ask
is the Lord's will.

1242
01:39:35.834 --> 01:39:38.803
Or Allahs,
or Yahwehs.

1243
01:39:40.205 --> 01:39:42.040
And I suppose they're right.

1244
01:39:46.445 --> 01:39:50.314
Because if he was not vengeful,
I would not exist, now would I?

1245
01:39:50.315 --> 01:39:53.718
I've had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

1246
01:39:53.719 --> 01:39:55.954
You're still alive
because you have no weapon,

1247
01:39:55.955 --> 01:39:57.555
And they didn't
ask me to kill you,

1248
01:39:57.556 --> 01:39:59.356
But if you pursue me,

1249
01:39:59.357 --> 01:40:01.492
It is another matter.

1250
01:40:08.166 --> 01:40:09.968
Be careful.

1251
01:40:09.969 --> 01:40:12.136
These are men of God.

1252
01:40:24.549 --> 01:40:26.484
The camerlengo.

1253
01:40:34.293 --> 01:40:37.011
Have you come to make me
a martyr?

1254
01:40:44.136 --> 01:40:46.704
Here. Here. Here.

1255
01:42:13.475 --> 01:42:15.743
I need to see the camerlengo.
He is not available.

1256
01:42:15.744 --> 01:42:19.680
I demand to see the camerlengo!
He is not available.

1257
01:42:19.681 --> 01:42:21.949
We'll see about that.

1258
01:42:30.825 --> 01:42:34.078
All locked up. <i>Senza chiave,</i>
it's a one-way portal.

1259
01:42:34.079 --> 01:42:36.381
The only entrance
is on the other side.

1260
01:42:36.382 --> 01:42:39.300
No! Hey!

1261
01:42:39.301 --> 01:42:41.602
I don't care who he talks to.

1262
01:42:41.603 --> 01:42:44.472
He doesn't go into that room.

1263
01:42:46.508 --> 01:42:49.610
This is Robert Langdon
and Dr. Vetra! Open the door!

1264
01:42:51.579 --> 01:42:52.946
Open up!

1265
01:42:56.701 --> 01:42:58.319
<i>Open the door!</i>

1266
01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.187
Hey!

1267
01:43:02.341 --> 01:43:05.176
The camerlengo is in danger.

1268
01:43:19.174 --> 01:43:21.092
He's the one!
He's got a gun!

1269
01:43:25.297 --> 01:43:27.131
Illuminatus!
You bastard.

1270
01:43:27.132 --> 01:43:30.718
Illuminatus!
Sanctimonious bastard!

1271
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:39.443
Padre.

1272
01:43:39.444 --> 01:43:41.145
Order the evacuation.

1273
01:43:41.146 --> 01:43:42.930
We only have 19 minutes.

1274
01:43:47.135 --> 01:43:49.070
Here, he's--

1275
01:43:49.071 --> 01:43:51.305
And get the helicopter
for the older cardinals.

1276
01:43:51.306 --> 01:43:52.757
Yes, sir.

1277
01:44:05.587 --> 01:44:06.904
Robert?

1278
01:44:06.905 --> 01:44:09.440
The brand, the symbol,
could it have another meaning?

1279
01:44:16.315 --> 01:44:19.517
Crossed keys.
But those are upside down.

1280
01:44:19.518 --> 01:44:21.602
St. Peter.

1281
01:44:22.588 --> 01:44:25.222
The first pope...

1282
01:44:25.223 --> 01:44:26.924
Was crucified upside down.

1283
01:44:26.925 --> 01:44:29.861
On Vatican hill.
A few hundred feet below us.

1284
01:44:29.862 --> 01:44:31.645
Necropolis,
city of the dead.

1285
01:44:31.646 --> 01:44:33.830
"upon this rock
I will build my church."

1286
01:44:33.831 --> 01:44:36.917
Or bring it down upon itself.

1287
01:44:36.918 --> 01:44:40.838
The bomb is in St. Peter's tomb.

1288
01:44:55.737 --> 01:44:57.438
The grid is still cycling.

1289
01:44:57.439 --> 01:45:00.107
The power to this
section must be down.

1290
01:45:47.322 --> 01:45:50.324
It must be here.
It must be.

1291
01:46:01.286 --> 01:46:03.621
Don't touch it.

1292
01:46:03.622 --> 01:46:04.905
We have seven minutes.

1293
01:46:11.046 --> 01:46:14.048
Robert, hold this.

1294
01:46:54.973 --> 01:46:57.425
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1295
01:46:57.426 --> 01:46:59.126
What's wrong?

1296
01:46:59.127 --> 01:47:01.628
Cold decreases battery life.

1297
01:47:03.664 --> 01:47:05.733
We may have less
than five minutes.

1298
01:47:05.734 --> 01:47:07.685
So?

1299
01:47:07.686 --> 01:47:10.454
If I pull the power with
less than five minutes,

1300
01:47:10.455 --> 01:47:13.057
The residual charge
won't hold suspension.

1301
01:47:14.875 --> 01:47:18.011
We should leave it here
and get clear if we can.

1302
01:47:18.012 --> 01:47:20.547
At least down here, the damage--
No!

1303
01:47:20.548 --> 01:47:22.649
- No, wait!
- Father!

1304
01:47:25.037 --> 01:47:27.054
We are live here at St. Peter's square,

1305
01:47:27.055 --> 01:47:30.757
Where despite a bomb threat
and an order of evacuation,

1306
01:47:30.758 --> 01:47:33.294
The crowd is actually
growing in size,

1307
01:47:33.295 --> 01:47:35.212
As we await an
official announcement

1308
01:47:35.213 --> 01:47:37.014
From the Vatican spokesman

1309
01:47:37.015 --> 01:47:38.666
As to the exact nature
of the threat

1310
01:47:38.667 --> 01:47:40.367
And whether or not
they are treating it

1311
01:47:40.368 --> 01:47:41.669
As a credible danger.

1312
01:47:49.895 --> 01:47:51.161
This way.

1313
01:48:24.011 --> 01:48:25.829
A bomb?

1314
01:48:30.534 --> 01:48:34.488
Roberto, there's an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

1315
01:48:38.527 --> 01:48:40.894
He's got clearance.

1316
01:49:05.203 --> 01:49:07.570
Oh, my God.

1317
01:51:08.993 --> 01:51:10.961
Get down!

1318
01:54:03.134 --> 01:54:05.602
Cardinal Strauss?

1319
01:54:05.603 --> 01:54:09.740
it was the camerlengo.
He saved us all!

1320
01:54:09.741 --> 01:54:14.377
He saved the church
and he is alive.

1321
01:54:14.378 --> 01:54:16.396
Praise God.
Praise God.

1322
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:23.470
He is alive.

1323
01:54:23.471 --> 01:54:27.206
He sacrificed himself
for all of us.

1324
01:54:33.981 --> 01:54:36.216
It's so incredible.
He survived.

1325
01:54:54.235 --> 01:54:59.206
You know, the worst thing
we thought would happen

1326
01:54:59.207 --> 01:55:01.374
Was that our work
would fall into the hands

1327
01:55:01.375 --> 01:55:03.409
Of the energy companies.

1328
01:55:05.363 --> 01:55:08.164
We thought we
could change the world.

1329
01:55:08.165 --> 01:55:09.566
So naive.

1330
01:55:09.567 --> 01:55:13.337
No, no. Not naive.

1331
01:55:13.338 --> 01:55:15.439
Innocent, maybe.

1332
01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.741
But that's not a crime.

1333
01:55:19.043 --> 01:55:21.244
I'm not so sure.

1334
01:55:22.747 --> 01:55:26.115
Go back to work.

1335
01:55:26.116 --> 01:55:28.602
Change the world.

1336
01:55:47.121 --> 01:55:50.457
A gift. Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1337
01:55:50.458 --> 01:55:53.460
For Catholics, for everyone.

1338
01:55:53.461 --> 01:55:57.197
Camerlengo's age
shouldn't be an obstacle.

1339
01:55:57.198 --> 01:55:59.732
<i>Signori,</i>
you are no doubt aware

1340
01:55:59.733 --> 01:56:01.668
That by holy law
the man is ineligible

1341
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:03.437
For election to the papacy.

1342
01:56:03.438 --> 01:56:05.639
He is not a cardinal,
he is a priest.

1343
01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.357
He is of
insufficient age.

1344
01:56:07.358 --> 01:56:08.408
Well, maybe there's a way

1345
01:56:08.409 --> 01:56:10.526
We could consider the possibilities.

1346
01:56:10.527 --> 01:56:12.996
I am sorry.
The protocols of conclave

1347
01:56:12.997 --> 01:56:15.414
Are not subject
to modification.

1348
01:56:15.415 --> 01:56:17.416
I will not call
a ballot on this matter.

1349
01:56:17.417 --> 01:56:20.520
But, "signore", you would
not call the ballot.

1350
01:56:20.521 --> 01:56:22.039
Surely you remember.

1351
01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:24.858
You gave up your
post as great elector.

1352
01:56:24.859 --> 01:56:27.377
They are singing in St. Peter's square.

1353
01:56:27.378 --> 01:56:30.163
And what happened here
tonight transcends our laws.

1354
01:56:30.164 --> 01:56:31.598
Does it?

1355
01:56:31.599 --> 01:56:34.668
Is it God's will that we give
ourselves over to frenzy?

1356
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:36.503
Discard the rules of the church?

1357
01:56:36.504 --> 01:56:39.756
Perhaps we need
not discard them.

1358
01:56:39.757 --> 01:56:44.611
"Signore", I am thinking now
of "Romano pontifici eligendo",

1359
01:56:44.612 --> 01:56:45.728
<i>Numero sessanta--</i>

1360
01:56:45.729 --> 01:56:47.981
Acclamation by adoration.

1361
01:56:49.651 --> 01:56:52.302
If the holy spirit
speaks through us,

1362
01:56:52.303 --> 01:56:54.787
And we call
a man's name out loud--

1363
01:56:54.788 --> 01:56:57.908
That is election by adoration.

1364
01:56:57.909 --> 01:57:00.444
He's God's choice.
Yes.

1365
01:57:00.445 --> 01:57:02.479
And the candidate need only be

1366
01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:05.482
An ordained member
of the clergy

1367
01:57:05.483 --> 01:57:08.318
Present in the Sistine chapel

1368
01:57:08.319 --> 01:57:10.454
At the moment of his election.

1369
01:57:18.263 --> 01:57:19.913
I think we have it settled.

1370
01:57:43.387 --> 01:57:44.871
"Signore" camerlengo.

1371
01:57:44.872 --> 01:57:46.305
Yes?

1372
01:57:46.306 --> 01:57:48.007
The cardinals ask
you to join them

1373
01:57:48.008 --> 01:57:50.576
In conclave as
soon as possible.

1374
01:57:50.577 --> 01:57:51.978
Me?

1375
01:57:51.979 --> 01:57:54.080
Yes, padre.

1376
01:58:16.587 --> 01:58:18.155
What are you doing?

1377
01:58:18.156 --> 01:58:21.758
Silvano's journals.
I want them back.

1378
01:58:45.466 --> 01:58:47.517
Richter said...

1379
01:58:48.702 --> 01:58:50.971
His holiness suffered
from seizures,

1380
01:58:50.972 --> 01:58:54.174
But steps were taken...

1381
01:58:54.175 --> 01:58:56.726
For safety.

1382
01:58:59.781 --> 01:59:03.183
"made sure he was watched,"
he said.

1383
01:59:04.652 --> 01:59:09.373
What if he was trying
to give me this key?

1384
01:59:09.374 --> 01:59:11.641
That's the papal office.

1385
01:59:11.642 --> 01:59:13.643
If the pope was worried
about seizures,

1386
01:59:13.644 --> 01:59:15.579
He must have had
Richter install cameras

1387
01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:16.930
Without telling anyone.

1388
01:59:16.931 --> 01:59:19.833
To keep an eye on him.
For safety.

1389
01:59:21.486 --> 01:59:23.587
Maybe it records.

1390
01:59:34.265 --> 01:59:36.265
<i>I read the journals,</i>
<i>Patrick.</i>

1391
01:59:36.266 --> 01:59:38.869
<i>The scientist kept journals.</i>
<i>So?</i>

1392
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:40.904
<i>Well, you figure</i>
<i>prominently" <i>in them.</i>

1393
01:59:40.905 --> 01:59:42.555
<i>Really?</i>

1394
01:59:42.556 --> 01:59:45.058
<i>Bentivoglio wasn't</i>
<i>just a physicist,</i>

1395
01:59:45.059 --> 01:59:47.194
<i>He was also</i>
<i>a catholic priest.</i>

1396
01:59:47.195 --> 01:59:50.563
And as such,
he was deeply conflicted

1397
01:59:50.564 --> 01:59:52.232
About the implications of his work

1398
01:59:52.233 --> 01:59:54.618
And in need
of spiritual guidance.

1399
01:59:54.619 --> 01:59:57.186
Like Galileo.

1400
01:59:57.187 --> 02:00:00.723
About a month ago, he requested
an audience with the pope,

1401
02:00:00.724 --> 02:00:02.525
But you know that.

1402
02:00:02.526 --> 02:00:04.193
Because you granted
the audience,

1403
02:00:04.194 --> 02:00:05.895
And you were also
present during it.

1404
02:00:05.896 --> 02:00:09.299
The God particle. To actually
claim an act of creation.

1405
02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:11.101
The blasphemy.
The arrogance.

1406
02:00:11.102 --> 02:00:13.836
The holy father didn't
see it like that.

1407
02:00:13.837 --> 02:00:16.022
He urged him to go public.

1408
02:00:16.023 --> 02:00:17.874
His holiness thought
that the discovery

1409
02:00:17.875 --> 02:00:19.876
Could actually
scientifically prove

1410
02:00:19.877 --> 02:00:22.395
The existence
of a divine power,

1411
02:00:22.396 --> 02:00:25.398
And begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

1412
02:00:25.399 --> 02:00:28.285
His work was not religious,
it was sacrilegious.

1413
02:00:28.286 --> 02:00:29.852
But you--

1414
02:00:29.853 --> 02:00:33.390
You saw the pope's position
as a softening of church law.

1415
02:00:33.391 --> 02:00:36.243
As an old man's weakness.

1416
02:00:36.244 --> 02:00:37.744
Your father's weakness.

1417
02:00:37.745 --> 02:00:40.163
You murdered the vicar of Christ.

1418
02:00:40.164 --> 02:00:44.133
He raised me to protect
this church, even from within.

1419
02:00:44.134 --> 02:00:48.371
And then-- then you conjured up
an old enemy from the past.

1420
02:00:48.372 --> 02:00:50.290
The illuminati.

1421
02:00:50.291 --> 02:00:52.609
You found the ancient brands
in the papal vaults,

1422
02:00:52.610 --> 02:00:54.611
And put them to use.

1423
02:00:54.612 --> 02:00:55.846
To spread fear.

1424
02:00:55.847 --> 02:00:58.414
The cardinals are
men of belief.

1425
02:00:58.415 --> 02:01:02.118
Right now, their belief
in evil is uniting them.

1426
02:01:02.119 --> 02:01:05.454
The entire catholic world
will be united by this attack.

1427
02:01:05.455 --> 02:01:08.290
There is no attack.

1428
02:01:08.291 --> 02:01:11.427
You're trying to convince
the cardinals they're in a war

1429
02:01:11.428 --> 02:01:13.530
So they will choose
a warrior to lead them.

1430
02:01:13.531 --> 02:01:14.831
We are at war.

1431
02:01:14.832 --> 02:01:17.033
We're weak when
we should be strong.

1432
02:01:17.034 --> 02:01:20.970
If science is allowed to claim
the power of creation,

1433
02:01:20.971 --> 02:01:22.956
What is left for God?

1434
02:01:22.957 --> 02:01:24.607
It didn't work, Patrick.

1435
02:01:26.043 --> 02:01:29.412
It isn't finished.
Oh, yes, it's finished.

1436
02:01:30.715 --> 02:01:33.499
It's finished.

1437
02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:36.553
I've shown the journals
to Father Simeon.

1438
02:01:36.554 --> 02:01:39.055
The moment the doors
to the conclave open

1439
02:01:39.056 --> 02:01:42.325
He will tell the cardinals
what you've done.

1440
02:01:42.326 --> 02:01:44.861
I was planning on
doing this alone.

1441
02:01:47.365 --> 02:01:49.516
Put it down.

1442
02:01:51.953 --> 02:01:55.038
But perhaps it's better
that you're here.

1443
02:01:55.039 --> 02:01:56.205
Put it down.

1444
02:01:57.824 --> 02:01:59.692
Put it away.

1445
02:02:11.972 --> 02:02:15.225
Help! He's the one!
He's got a gun!

1446
02:02:19.013 --> 02:02:21.314
Illuminatus!
You bastard.

1447
02:02:21.315 --> 02:02:23.299
Illuminatus!
Sanctimonious bastard!

1448
02:02:38.949 --> 02:02:42.451
<i>And get the helicopter</i>
<i>for the older cardinals, right?</i>

1449
02:02:45.806 --> 02:02:47.173
<i>Robert?</i>

1450
02:02:47.174 --> 02:02:49.842
<i>The brand, the symbol,</i>
<i>could it have another meaning?</i>

1451
02:03:33.421 --> 02:03:36.656
I've been summoned by
the college of cardinals.

1452
02:04:49.730 --> 02:04:51.297
Gently...

1453
02:04:51.298 --> 02:04:53.032
But within our walls.

1454
02:05:56.697 --> 02:06:00.400
Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit.

1455
02:06:51.035 --> 02:06:53.052
Church sources now confirm

1456
02:06:53.053 --> 02:06:55.554
That camerlengo
father Patrick Mckenna

1457
02:06:55.555 --> 02:07:00.293
Has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall.

1458
02:07:00.294 --> 02:07:02.761
Crowds of the faithful are calling for

1459
02:07:02.762 --> 02:07:06.499
The camerlengo's immediate
canonization and sainthood.

1460
02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.300
The Vatican also
announced the death

1461
02:07:08.301 --> 02:07:10.536
Of three of its cardinals

1462
02:07:10.537 --> 02:07:13.139
In the fire
at Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1463
02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:15.575
<i>--As we await the appearance</i>
<i>of the new holy father</i>

1464
02:07:15.576 --> 02:07:17.643
<i>Cardinal Baggia of Italy,</i>

1465
02:07:17.644 --> 02:07:19.945
<i>One of the four</i>
<i>original preferiti,</i>

1466
02:07:19.946 --> 02:07:22.381
Who, despite terrorist
attempts at disruption,

1467
02:07:22.382 --> 02:07:23.816
Seems to have been selected

1468
02:07:23.817 --> 02:07:26.352
In one of the swiftest
and smoothest conclaves

1469
02:07:26.353 --> 02:07:28.254
In modern church history.

1470
02:07:35.045 --> 02:07:37.146
Professor Langdon?
Please.

1471
02:07:54.364 --> 02:07:57.934
A token of thanks
from his holiness,

1472
02:07:57.935 --> 02:08:02.021
And from his
new camerlengo.

1473
02:08:02.022 --> 02:08:05.174
We are grateful
you saved his life.

1474
02:08:05.175 --> 02:08:08.611
And it's our understanding
that you require this text

1475
02:08:08.612 --> 02:08:10.829
To complete
your scholarly work.

1476
02:08:12.666 --> 02:08:16.002
We ask only that in your last
will and testament

1477
02:08:16.003 --> 02:08:18.554
You ensure...

1478
02:08:18.555 --> 02:08:20.490
It finds its way home.

1479
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:24.460
Of course.

1480
02:08:24.461 --> 02:08:26.846
And when you write of us,

1481
02:08:26.847 --> 02:08:29.732
And you will write of us,

1482
02:08:29.733 --> 02:08:32.201
May I ask one thing?

1483
02:08:32.202 --> 02:08:34.036
Do so gently.

1484
02:08:36.206 --> 02:08:37.974
I'll try.

1485
02:08:37.975 --> 02:08:40.509
Religion is flawed,

1486
02:08:40.510 --> 02:08:43.479
But only because
man is flawed.

1487
02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.882
All men,
including this one.

1488
02:09:01.665 --> 02:09:03.399
He chose the name Luke.

1489
02:09:05.803 --> 02:09:09.221
There's been many
marks and johns...

1490
02:09:10.641 --> 02:09:12.942
Never a Luke.

1491
02:09:12.943 --> 02:09:15.644
It's said he was a doctor.

1492
02:09:15.645 --> 02:09:19.782
It's quite a message,
science and Faith all in one.

1493
02:09:19.783 --> 02:09:21.717
The world is in need of both.

1494
02:09:24.438 --> 02:09:27.023
You will counsel him wisely.

1495
02:09:27.024 --> 02:09:30.559
I am an old man.
I will counsel him briefly.

1496
02:09:36.249 --> 02:09:38.584
Mr. Langdon...

1497
02:09:43.423 --> 02:09:48.194
Thanks be to God for sending
someone to protect his church.

1498
02:09:52.332 --> 02:09:55.218
I don't believe he sent me,
father.

1499
02:09:55.219 --> 02:09:57.619
Oh, my son,

1500
02:09:57.620 --> 02:09:59.922
Of course he did.
