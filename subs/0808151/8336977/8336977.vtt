the origins of the universe,

we could not exist.

out of suspension

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.472
say, the bottom of the canister,

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:32.740
the two opposing forces

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:34.809

violently.

to fall out of suspension?

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.482

How violent?

00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:45.219

the place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.

350
00:22:55.873 --> 00:22:58.209
If I can find the <i>segno,</i>
the sign

351
00:22:58.342 --> 00:23:01.546
that marks the beginning
of that path,

352
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:03.080
the four churches along it

353
00:23:03.214 --> 00:23:05.483
may be where he intends
to murder your cardinals.

354
00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:09.120
One every hour
at 8, 9, 10 and 11.

355
00:23:09.253 --> 00:23:11.756
Then the device explodes
at midnight.

356
00:23:11.889 --> 00:23:14.225
If we can figure out
the first church

357
00:23:14.358 --> 00:23:16.761
and get there before he does
maybe we can stop it.

358
00:23:16.894 --> 00:23:19.063
But I can't find
the start of the path

359
00:23:19.196 --> 00:23:20.998
until I get into the archives.

360
00:23:21.132 --> 00:23:23.701
Even if I wanted to help you,

361
00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:26.270
access to the archives
is only by written decree

362
00:23:26.403 --> 00:23:29.373
by the curator and the
Board of Vatican Librarians.

363
00:23:29.507 --> 00:23:31.875
Or by papal mandate.

364
00:23:32.008 --> 00:23:33.409
Yes, but as you no doubt
have heard,

365
00:23:33.544 --> 00:23:35.211
the Holy Father is dead.

366
00:23:35.345 --> 00:23:37.347
What about <i>il</i> camerlengo?

367
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.149
The camerlengo
is just a priest here,

368
00:23:39.282 --> 00:23:40.817
the former pope's chamberlain.

369
00:23:40.951 --> 00:23:43.186
Doesn't the power
of the Holy See rest in him

370
00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:44.988

371
00:23:52.896 --> 00:23:55.999

CAMERLENGO:
<i>His Holiness once told me</i>

373
00:23:59.069 --> 00:24:02.773
<i>a pope was a man torn between
the real world and the divine.</i>

374
00:24:02.906 --> 00:24:06.977
It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.

375
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.979
I'm familiar
with Illuminati lore

376
00:24:09.112 --> 00:24:10.781
and the legend of the brandings.

377
00:24:10.914 --> 00:24:14.317
<i>La purga</i> is a dark stain
on this Church's history.

378
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.753
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

<i>Comandante,</i>

380
00:24:21.257 --> 00:24:23.359
have you begun the search
for this explosive device?

381
00:24:23.493 --> 00:24:25.128
Of course,
but it could be anywhere.

382
00:24:25.261 --> 00:24:28.031
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

383
00:24:28.164 --> 00:24:30.366
The Sistine Chapel
is a fortress.

384
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.202
As long as the cardinals
are in conclave,

385
00:24:32.335 --> 00:24:34.504
your security concerns
are at a minimum.

a naked-eye search

00:24:39.843 --> 00:24:41.744
I will tell you we do not
have the people.

390
00:24:41.877 --> 00:24:45.114
Though I am not His Holiness,
when you are addressing me,

391
00:24:45.247 --> 00:24:47.683
you are addressing this office.
Do you understand?

392
00:24:49.852 --> 00:24:50.953
Yes, Father.

393
00:24:51.086 --> 00:24:53.322
CAMERLENGO:
Good.

394
00:24:53.455 --> 00:24:55.591
Now, you said the image
on the screen

395
00:24:55.725 --> 00:24:58.260
was illuminated
by artificial light.

396
00:24:58.393 --> 00:25:00.562
Might I suggest
methodically cutting power

397
00:25:00.696 --> 00:25:02.798
to various sections of the city.

398
00:25:02.932 --> 00:25:05.500
When the image goes dark,
you'll have a specific idea

399
00:25:05.635 --> 00:25:07.903
of the camera's location.

Dr. Vetra, besides yourself
and your research partner,

00:25:14.844 --> 00:25:18.480
who else knew about this
antimatter project?

402
00:25:18.614 --> 00:25:20.783
No one but the research team.

403
00:25:20.916 --> 00:25:23.085
This project was strictly
confidential.

404
00:25:23.218 --> 00:25:25.254
But Silvano kept detailed
journals.

405
00:25:25.387 --> 00:25:26.722
If he told anyone else

406
00:25:26.856 --> 00:25:29.792
about what we were doing,
he would have made a note of it.

407
00:25:29.925 --> 00:25:31.393
Do you have these journals?

408
00:25:31.526 --> 00:25:33.663
I can have them flown here
from Geneva in an hour.

409
00:25:33.796 --> 00:25:34.830

Mr. Langdon,

412
00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:55.717
you are correct that I may grant
you access to the archives.

413
00:25:57.485 --> 00:25:59.287
Thank you, Padre.

414
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.225
I said that you were correct
that I may, not that I will.

415
00:26:04.358 --> 00:26:07.461
Christianity's most sacred
codices are in that archive.

416
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:12.366
Given your recent entanglement
with the Church,

417
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.268
there is a question
I'd like to ask you first,

418
00:26:14.402 --> 00:26:17.438
here, in the office
of His Holiness.

419
00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:27.015
Do you believe in God, sir?

420
00:26:30.618 --> 00:26:34.122
Father, I simply believe
that religion...

421
00:26:34.255 --> 00:26:37.726
I did not ask if you believe
what man says about God.

422
00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:39.828
I asked if you believe in God.

423
00:26:42.563 --> 00:26:45.333
I'm an academic.

424
00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:48.536
My mind tells me I will never

425
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:51.005
understand God.

426
00:26:51.139 --> 00:26:52.907
And your heart?

427
00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:57.946
Tells me I'm not meant to.

428
00:26:59.312 --> 00:27:01.114

429
00:27:01.248 --> 00:27:03.550

that may be where they've hidden
the antimatter.

"A shining star at the end
of the path." I thought so too.

437
00:27:31.144 --> 00:27:34.147
Follow the path, and we may find
the canister at the end of it.

438

Can you deactivate the device?
I can change the batteries,

as long as we have
more than five minutes of life.

440
00:27:39.186 --> 00:27:41.121

that the <i>segno's</i> there?

00:34:56.217 --> 00:34:57.618
The number 503.

538
00:34:57.751 --> 00:35:01.721
I kept seeing it over and over
again in Illuminati letters,

539

scribbled in the margins,
sometimes just signed "503."

540
00:35:05.858 --> 00:35:07.660
It's a numeric clue.
But to what?

541
00:35:07.793 --> 00:35:10.696
Five? Well, that's a meaningful
number to the Illuminati.

542
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.465
There's the pentagram,
Pythagoras,

about the Earth revolving
around the sun.

560

recant in the second book.

would dissolve, disappear.
