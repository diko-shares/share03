00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:52.242
Help! Help!

2
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.542
- Am I dead?
- You're not dead.

3
00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:57.811
You've been taken against your will.

4
00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:58.977
Kobe?

5
00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:00.952
Who is that?

6
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.827
Dr. Phil? What the hell's going on?

7
00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:12.855
I don't know. I was doing a show
on teens with abandonment issues

8
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.128
and suddenly I woke up here.

9
00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:17.636
Man, those kids are gonna be pissed.

10
00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:23.139
Hello, gentlemen.
You don't know me but I know you.

11
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.509
You both play games
with other people for a living.

12
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.447
But today,
you play a game for your lives.

13
00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:32.714
Right now you are both breathing in
a deadly nerve gas.

14
00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:36.415
You have 120 seconds
to reach the antidote

15
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.855
or you die.

16
00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:39.893
Oh, my God! I've gotta get out of here.

17
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.825
Let the game begin.

18
00:01:44.598 --> 00:01:46.088
There.

19
00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:54.204
Hit the metal arm with something.

20
00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.274
There.

21
00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:08.744
Dammit!

22
00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:12.114
- Sorry.
- Shaquille,

23
00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:17.627
I'm not angry at you
but we are one minute away from death.

24
00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:20.064
Just shut out the "no" voice.

25
00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:21.658
Own your success.

26
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.978
Just make the damn basket.

27
00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:38.351
- What the hell was that for?
- You hurt my feelings.

28
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.721
Your feelings? To hell with your
feelings. Everybody with their feelings.

29
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:46.783
"I'm obese." "My kid's a brat."
"Help me, help me."

30
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.524
Just shut up! Why can't I fix anyone?
I'm so dumb and worthless.

31
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.763
- Momma was right.
- Hey, hey.

32
00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:58.532
Pull yourself together.
You're a brilliant doctor.

33
00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:01.641
- Not exactly.
- What?

34
00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:04.808
I just tell people to "get real".

35
00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:07.312
I'm not even a psychologist.

36
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:09.144
I'm an electrician.

37
00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:13.150
I failed you, Shaq. I failed you.

38
00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:23.487
- Boo ya!
- Yes!

39
00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:29.163
30 seconds left.

40
00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.674
- This'll never work.
- Of course,

41
00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:36.937
he wants us to cut through our feet.

42
00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:40.039
You go first.

43
00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:42.105
Bullshit.

44
00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:46.443
Yeah. You're probably not man enough.

45
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.920
I guess your momma was right.

46
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:54.788
Never. Who's the coward now, Momma?

47
00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:57.464
Candy from a baby.

48
00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:04.626
- Oh, my God!
- I did it! We're saved.

49
00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.299
- What's wrong?
- Wrong foot.

50
00:04:11.478 --> 00:04:12.672
Motherf...

51
00:04:25.726 --> 00:04:30.095
No one believed, in the early years
of the 21st century,

52
00:04:30.164 --> 00:04:32.359
that our world was being watched.

53
00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:34.492
The way a man with a microscope

54
00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:37.503
might scrutinize the creatures
in a drop of water.

55
00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:01.388
Yet across the gulf of space,

56
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.362
a terrible evil
prepared to unleash itself

57
00:05:05.432 --> 00:05:08.560
upon an unsuspecting human race.

58
00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:25.347
You're up early. Come back to bed.

59
00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:28.387
Come on.

60
00:05:30.424 --> 00:05:31.721
Please.

61
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.248
Hello? Hello?

62
00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:58.141
Tom!

63
00:06:00.287 --> 00:06:04.747
I know you missed me. I missed you, too.
God, you look great.

64
00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:08.761
I wanted to come by to thank you for
setting up that job interview for me.

65
00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:10.353
This isn't a good time.

66
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.764
I just need something to keep me busy
now Cody's out of the house.

67
00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:17.235
He just turned 11. I enrolled him
in military school last year.

68
00:06:18.272 --> 00:06:20.331
It's supposed to be a great program.

69
00:06:20.407 --> 00:06:23.399
Boy, kids, you know,
they just grow up so fast.

70
00:06:23.477 --> 00:06:25.377
So I heard you were dating again.

71
00:06:25.446 --> 00:06:27.641
Knowing you, I bet she's brainy.

72
00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:30.478
- "Quixotic".
- 90 points!

73
00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:37.457
Your work with the elderly
really inspired me, Tom.

74
00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:43.122
I mean, they have so much to teach us
and we have so much to teach them.

75
00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:48.658
You know, ultimately they really are
just like us. Only older.

76
00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:52.569
Anyway, I'm hoping
that a new career

77
00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.200
will help keep
my mind off of bad memories.

78
00:06:56.276 --> 00:07:00.474
I'm sure you have memories too. He's
the kind of person you never forget.

79
00:07:00.547 --> 00:07:03.516
Sometimes I wake up in the night
wondering where he is.

80
00:07:03.584 --> 00:07:05.347
And then I remember.

81
00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.856
I know you miss him too
but it's really been hardest on me.

82
00:07:09.923 --> 00:07:13.757
I'm rattling on,
but if you don't vent your emotions

83
00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:18.230
they just well up and burst out. The
harder you try, the harder it all gets.

84
00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.493
Until you just can't shake it off
anymore.

85
00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:24.904
It's like you're carrying around
this enormous burden.

86
00:07:24.972 --> 00:07:29.432
Sometimes your problems get so big
you can't wrap your head around them.

87
00:07:29.943 --> 00:07:32.434
- And then what do you say to yourself?
- Jesus!

88
00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:36.108
Yes, you can turn to religion,
or family and friends,

89
00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:38.481
but in the end, you're still in agony.

90
00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:41.947
Maybe that's why I want
to become a nurse.

91
00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:45.185
I'm so in tune
with everyone's emotions.

92
00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:47.784
I guess I've always had a knack
for being...

93
00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:20.289
Ryan, go home.
You've been working 16 straight hours.

94
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.760
Come on, I need the overtime.

95
00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:26.321
Don't worry, OK. I'm wide...

96
00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:31.966
Ryan, what are you doing?

97
00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:37.672
That was gold bullion.

98
00:08:40.414 --> 00:08:41.813
Not the monkeys!

99
00:08:53.527 --> 00:08:56.189
Dammit, Tom, what the hell
happened back there?

100
00:08:56.263 --> 00:08:58.595
Come on, Ed,
that coulda happened to anyone.

101
00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:00.963
Oh, yeah?
You know what your problem is?

102
00:09:01.034 --> 00:09:04.094
As soon as the going gets tough,
you give up.

103
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:07.538
- You're right. I quit.
- Ah, you don't get it, do you?

104
00:09:08.241 --> 00:09:11.335
You could be the best,
if only you'd see things through.

105
00:09:11.411 --> 00:09:13.845
- I don't know.
- Give me a break.

106
00:09:13.914 --> 00:09:16.974
What can I tell you, Ed?
I guess I'm no good.

107
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.018
Maybe I just don't have what it takes.

108
00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:22.817
What are you talking about?
You secured that tricky H-500 unit.

109
00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:25.414
Oh, come on, that was easy.

110
00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:36.026
Tom Ryan. Haven't seen you in a while.

111
00:09:36.103 --> 00:09:39.630
Well, I spend every waking minute
of my life operating a crane.

112
00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:41.867
God, I hate my job.

113
00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:48.472
Yo, Tom! Where you been?

114
00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:51.642
- Mahalik.
- C.J., this is my boy Tom Ryan.

115
00:09:51.718 --> 00:09:53.948
We used to work together
down at the docks.

116
00:09:54.988 --> 00:09:58.151
- Tom, how's the family, man?
- You remember Marilyn?

117
00:09:58.225 --> 00:10:00.785
- Your wife. How could I forget?
- She dumped me.

118
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.762
Yeah, I know.
I slept with her a few times.

119
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.263
- What?
- Me too.

120
00:10:05.332 --> 00:10:07.926
You guys talking about Marilyn?
Great lay.

121
00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:10.231
My pops introduced me to her.

122
00:10:10.303 --> 00:10:12.965
Since the divorce
it's like my life has no purpose.

123
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.373
- Half the time, I feel like a zombie.
- Don't joke about zombies.

124
00:10:16.443 --> 00:10:19.606
- That shit is real.
- Yo, you know LaShanda on 120th Street?

125
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.669
Yeah.

126
00:10:20.747 --> 00:10:23.580
She told me she heard a zombie
going through her trash.

127
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.982
The next morning, she turned up missing.

128
00:10:26.053 --> 00:10:29.181
What? OK, back up.
How in the hell do you turn up missing?

129
00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:32.350
Nobody knows where you are
when they realize you ain't there.

130
00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:35.122
- Guys, I'm trying to...
- Whoa, so you're telling me

131
00:10:35.195 --> 00:10:37.493
you can appear and disappear
at the same time?

132
00:10:37.564 --> 00:10:39.555
No, you can't do both at the same time.

133
00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:42.124
- The bitch ain't David Copperfield.
- Guys...

134
00:10:42.202 --> 00:10:46.036
No, but you can be gone from one place
and show up somewhere else.

135
00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:50.065
When you turn up, you're never missing.
When you're missing, you never turn up.

136
00:10:50.143 --> 00:10:52.611
Unless you a zombie.

137
00:10:53.814 --> 00:10:57.306
Damn! That's some plausible shit!
You should blog about that.

138
00:10:57.384 --> 00:11:00.012
- I'm gonna put that on MySpace.
- You do it then.

139
00:11:01.688 --> 00:11:05.124
Tom, what you need to do, man,
you need to get away from all this.

140
00:11:05.192 --> 00:11:08.025
- You need to take a break.
- I don't know.

141
00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:11.531
No, he's right, man. You should
come fishing with us one weekend.

142
00:11:11.598 --> 00:11:14.192
Me and Mahalik found this great spot
last summer.

143
00:11:14.267 --> 00:11:16.758
Yeah. Great spot.

144
00:11:24.311 --> 00:11:25.573
Hey.

145
00:11:25.645 --> 00:11:27.476
You cold?

146
00:11:28.615 --> 00:11:30.606
A little bit.

147
00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:42.755
Hey, look, man, I'm not on the down low
or nothing, all right?

148
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.094
Oh, that's cool, man. Me neither.

149
00:11:49.836 --> 00:11:50.962
Hey, what you doing?

150
00:11:51.037 --> 00:11:53.267
Relax.
I'm just trying to grab some nuts.

151
00:12:05.418 --> 00:12:08.387
I've been alone with you

152
00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:11.424
Inside my mind

153
00:12:11.491 --> 00:12:14.460
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips

154
00:12:15.962 --> 00:12:17.827
A thousand times

155
00:12:19.466 --> 00:12:25.029
I sometimes see you pass
outside my door

156
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.971
Hello

157
00:12:29.609 --> 00:12:33.067
Is it me you're looking for?

158
00:12:33.814 --> 00:12:35.907
I can see it in your eyes

159
00:12:37.284 --> 00:12:39.718
I can see it in your smile

160
00:12:40.587 --> 00:12:43.385
You're all I ever wanted

161
00:12:43.924 --> 00:12:46.392
And my arms are open wide

162
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.658
'Cause you know just what to say

163
00:12:49.729 --> 00:12:51.890
Ooh, baby.

164
00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:54.695
And you know just what to do

165
00:12:54.768 --> 00:12:58.329
And I want to tell you so much

166
00:13:01.374 --> 00:13:04.036
I love you

167
00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:12.084
- Yeah. We caught a lot of fish.
- Yeah.

168
00:13:14.154 --> 00:13:16.054
Black cod.

169
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.058
- Damn.
- Tom, I don't want you thinking...

170
00:13:21.127 --> 00:13:23.061
I hope this won't affect your opin...

171
00:13:23.129 --> 00:13:25.495
Why do that when
it's the first time we've met?

172
00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:42.042
- Late again, Tom.
- Hey, Marilyn.

173
00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:45.278
- I thought you were moving.
- It's all I can afford right now.

174
00:13:45.352 --> 00:13:47.252
You took everything except my name.

175
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.584
No, the judge granted me that yesterday.

176
00:13:49.656 --> 00:13:51.988
You're now officially
Horace P. McTitties.

177
00:13:53.927 --> 00:13:56.088
I'm sure your new husband is pleased.

178
00:13:56.162 --> 00:13:58.858
He's a good man. A provider, unlike you.

179
00:13:58.932 --> 00:14:02.868
- You never cared about our children.
- That's not true, I'm a great dad.

180
00:14:03.503 --> 00:14:04.902
Kids.

181
00:14:05.572 --> 00:14:06.971
Dad?

182
00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:15.013
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Rachel.

183
00:14:15.081 --> 00:14:17.481
How's it going there, Princess?

184
00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:21.376
It's locked.

185
00:14:24.224 --> 00:14:26.192
- Let me help you.
- I should do that.

186
00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:27.954
- It's no problem.
- I don't mind.

187
00:14:28.028 --> 00:14:29.825
- Neither do I.
- Fine, you take it.

188
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:33.022
I'll see you on Tuesday.

189
00:14:33.099 --> 00:14:34.862
Hey, Marilyn.

190
00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:38.227
It's a good look for you,
being pregnant.

191
00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:41.664
I'm not pregnant.

192
00:14:43.109 --> 00:14:44.576
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

193
00:14:44.644 --> 00:14:47.477
If you wanna make things right,
start with our kids.

194
00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:50.641
You're right.
Those kids are all I have in this world.

195
00:14:50.717 --> 00:14:53.550
Well, the kids and my car.

196
00:14:59.492 --> 00:15:02.859
Mr. Koji. Looks like we need someone new
for the Norris account.

197
00:15:02.929 --> 00:15:07.662
Again? Every day we don't have someone
looking after this woman, I lose money.

198
00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:11.295
- What happened to last girl?
- Yoko. Take a look.

199
00:15:12.439 --> 00:15:16.637
Holy shit! Someone put a towel under her
or something. Christ.

200
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.544
It's the Norris house, Mr. Koji.
They say it's cursed.

201
00:15:20.613 --> 00:15:22.444
There's no such thing as a curse.

202
00:15:22.515 --> 00:15:26.611
Don't be ridiculous.
Those just old wives' tales.

203
00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:30.281
I need someone there today
or I'm in big trouble.

204
00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:37.719
Hello. I'm Cindy Campbell, I'm looking
for a job in home healthcare.

205
00:15:39.165 --> 00:15:43.397
I was recommended by a family friend,
but unfortunately he... Oh, my God!

206
00:15:44.137 --> 00:15:46.503
Don't mind her. She slip and fall.

207
00:15:46.573 --> 00:15:48.632
You my new best employee.

208
00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:51.973
- Ready to start today?
- It's so fast. I don't know.

209
00:15:52.045 --> 00:15:54.411
Trust me, you're gonna love this job.

210
00:15:54.481 --> 00:15:56.847
I show you.
We can be there in ten minutes.

211
00:16:08.895 --> 00:16:10.487
Come. Come.

212
00:16:21.775 --> 00:16:23.538
Mr. Koji?

213
00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:28.274
Hello?

214
00:16:39.492 --> 00:16:40.754
Oh, my God!

215
00:16:42.095 --> 00:16:44.996
OK. Let's get you up and...

216
00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:49.394
Here we go. Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:16:49.469 --> 00:16:52.870
There you are. I see you've met
Mrs. Norris. She catatonic.

218
00:16:52.939 --> 00:16:55.635
Yes, I was just trying to get her
back up on the bed.

219
00:16:55.708 --> 00:16:57.539
I was afraid she'd be hurt.

220
00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.771
I just saw her lying here on the floor.

221
00:16:59.846 --> 00:17:02.576
Of course. I help.
You grab her legs, I grab her arms.

222
00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:05.311
Mrs. Norris,
I'm here to take care of you.

223
00:17:06.286 --> 00:17:08.811
Yes, I'm very happy to meet you too.

224
00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:13.617
See, this job perfect for you.
Let me show you rest of house.

225
00:17:14.194 --> 00:17:16.094
Right this way.

226
00:17:16.162 --> 00:17:18.130
So, what do you think?

227
00:17:18.198 --> 00:17:23.500
I don't know. There's something strange
about his house.

228
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.696
A presence.

229
00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:28.207
A presence? Don't be silly.
Nothing wrong with this house.

230
00:17:28.274 --> 00:17:32.233
It's funny. I always dreamt I'd live in
a house like this with my husband.

231
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:34.405
But I guess that's just all in the...

232
00:17:37.117 --> 00:17:38.482
past.

233
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:40.041
Who wants to see upstairs?

234
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.978
It's a nice neighborhood,
close to schools and shopping.

235
00:17:44.057 --> 00:17:47.493
Hardwood floors throughout.
Passed almost every inspection.

236
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.324
Big back garden. Goes back 100 feet.

237
00:17:51.131 --> 00:17:53.190
There's a garden on the other side...

238
00:17:57.036 --> 00:18:00.164
And in here is the bathroom.
Very big, very...

239
00:18:02.942 --> 00:18:04.273
nice.

240
00:18:04.344 --> 00:18:07.711
It is nice. It seems like it'd be
a great place to work.

241
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.341
I just can't shake this feeling of evil.

242
00:18:11.417 --> 00:18:13.044
Evil? That's crazy talk.

243
00:18:18.158 --> 00:18:20.718
Do you know about
the people who used to live here?

244
00:18:20.793 --> 00:18:25.196
People? No, nothing about people.
I don't remember anything.

245
00:18:25.265 --> 00:18:27.927
Did something strange happen
in this house?

246
00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:31.562
Strange? Don't be silly.
This house perfectly normal.

247
00:18:31.638 --> 00:18:36.098
I'm sure you're right. And yet
it's as if someone's watching us.

248
00:18:39.412 --> 00:18:41.676
- Mr. Koji?
- That was me.

249
00:18:41.748 --> 00:18:43.841
Just excited about hiring you.

250
00:18:43.917 --> 00:18:46.886
Very, very enthusiastic.

251
00:18:46.953 --> 00:18:52.482
We offer medical and dental,
and two weeks' paid vacation.

252
00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.528
I am hoping you can start today.

253
00:18:56.296 --> 00:19:00.130
Maybe get in a whole week.
You perfect for this job.

254
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.395
It a wonderful opportunity for you.

255
00:19:02.468 --> 00:19:05.869
Mr. Koji, is there something
you're not telling me about this?

256
00:19:11.678 --> 00:19:14.203
I was dirty.

257
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:16.607
So...

258
00:19:18.084 --> 00:19:19.711
the job?

259
00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:22.521
I'll take it.

260
00:19:26.893 --> 00:19:28.986
Get your glove, I'm in the backyard.

261
00:19:29.862 --> 00:19:31.955
Robbie, come on. Let's go.

262
00:19:32.832 --> 00:19:35.300
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

263
00:19:35.368 --> 00:19:38.997
Look, Rach, this is guy stuff.
You gotta trust me.

264
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.737
All right, Robbie, you ready
for the Tom Ryan express?

265
00:19:54.354 --> 00:19:57.790
Yeah. Maybe one day
I can grow up to be just like you.

266
00:19:57.857 --> 00:20:00.587
All right, I know I let you kids down

267
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.128
but you have no idea
how hard it is to be a father.

268
00:20:03.763 --> 00:20:06.755
When you start, let me know.

269
00:20:16.809 --> 00:20:20.040
- Are you OK?
- My eyes. My eyes.

270
00:20:23.783 --> 00:20:25.546
Oh, much...

271
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.020
better.

272
00:20:29.088 --> 00:20:31.022
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it's OK.

273
00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.388
I've taken balls to the face before.

274
00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:36.656
Hi, I'm Cindy Campbell,
your new neighbor.

275
00:20:36.729 --> 00:20:40.495
I'm Tom Ryan.
Do you live here all by yourself?

276
00:20:40.566 --> 00:20:42.796
Well, I'm taking care of Mrs. Norris,

277
00:20:42.869 --> 00:20:46.703
but, yes, for the first time in my life
I'm on my own.

278
00:20:46.773 --> 00:20:49.765
- I know that feeling.
- It looks like we have a lot in...

279
00:20:49.842 --> 00:20:51.503
Common.

280
00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:54.712
- We already finish each other's...
- Dinner.

281
00:20:56.616 --> 00:20:58.311
...sentences.

282
00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:03.779
Well, maybe all we really need
is a friend.

283
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.356
I'd like that. Well, I'd better get back
to Mrs. Norris.

284
00:21:08.928 --> 00:21:11.055
It's time to put her catheter in

285
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.156
and then I've got to scrub
in between her fat folds.

286
00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:17.794
I've got to lance her boils.
I've got to open her up and...

287
00:21:48.968 --> 00:21:52.028
...colostomy bag and mop up the drool.

288
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.605
That's wonderful.

289
00:21:55.675 --> 00:21:57.905
- I'll see you around.
- Definitely.

290
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.574
OK, Mrs. Norris, time to dig out
that doody bubble.

291
00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:32.362
Mrs. Norris, have you noticed
anything strange about this house?

292
00:23:32.972 --> 00:23:34.530
Yes. Yes.

293
00:23:34.607 --> 00:23:36.370
- No?
- Yes!

294
00:23:36.442 --> 00:23:39.275
You're probably right.
I guess I'm just being silly.

295
00:23:41.447 --> 00:23:43.278
Just relax.

296
00:23:43.349 --> 00:23:45.374
Here we go. OK.

297
00:23:46.152 --> 00:23:49.383
Oh, you poor thing,
you don't have to be scared.

298
00:23:49.455 --> 00:23:51.582
I'm here to take care of you.

299
00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:55.890
You know, I think you and I
are going to be wonderful friends.

300
00:23:56.629 --> 00:23:58.688
I do. That's right.

301
00:23:58.764 --> 00:24:01.995
Just relax. Let's get in those ears.

302
00:24:02.435 --> 00:24:04.733
OK. All right.

303
00:24:04.804 --> 00:24:06.533
That's right.

304
00:24:06.606 --> 00:24:08.471
That feels good.

305
00:24:11.177 --> 00:24:12.337
OK.

306
00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:16.009
You love this, don't you?

307
00:24:16.082 --> 00:24:19.518
It's nice and warm.
Feels good, doesn't it?

308
00:24:20.052 --> 00:24:21.519
Oh, my God!

309
00:24:22.822 --> 00:24:23.914
I'm so sorry.

310
00:25:45.371 --> 00:25:46.895
Robbie.

311
00:25:47.807 --> 00:25:49.297
Come on.

312
00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:51.366
Let's toss the old pigskin.

313
00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:03.513
I'm so sorry, I didn't see you there.
Are you all right?

314
00:26:04.123 --> 00:26:07.058
- It's OK, my throat cushioned the blow.
- Thank God.

315
00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:09.424
I lost my temper. My son's...

316
00:26:10.296 --> 00:26:13.424
- What's wrong? You look scared.
- Nothing, it's just...

317
00:26:14.767 --> 00:26:17.133
There's something going on
in this house.

318
00:26:17.203 --> 00:26:20.229
- Last night I saw a face.
- Did it have a nose?

319
00:26:20.306 --> 00:26:21.432
Yes.

320
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:24.168
That does sound like a face.

321
00:26:24.877 --> 00:26:27.209
Then there was this weird hand
in the shower,

322
00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:29.338
and this horrible thing on the stairs.

323
00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.508
I can't go through this all again.

324
00:26:31.584 --> 00:26:34.678
Oh, I get it. There's some other guy.

325
00:26:34.754 --> 00:26:37.985
You still love him, don't you?
I wish you both the best.

326
00:26:38.557 --> 00:26:39.956
Wait.

327
00:26:40.026 --> 00:26:43.393
You don't understand.
It's painful to talk about, but...

328
00:26:43.462 --> 00:26:45.623
you deserve to know.

329
00:26:46.866 --> 00:26:49.061
I was married once.

330
00:26:49.135 --> 00:26:52.298
- Get out the way, bitch.
- Don't call me no bitch.

331
00:26:52.371 --> 00:26:55.499
- You ain't shit.
- Shut your ass up, Snow Ho.

332
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:01.175
Well, actually married twice.

333
00:27:03.449 --> 00:27:05.610
My husband and I were living our dream.

334
00:27:05.685 --> 00:27:09.451
Ladies and gentlemen,
your challenger, Cindy Campbell.

335
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.423
Stay loose, Cindy.
Remember your training, keep your focus.

336
00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:18.886
Always think
"Where's the next punch coming..."

337
00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:21.956
After 20 fights, I was undefeated.

338
00:27:22.034 --> 00:27:24.502
Only one fighter stood between me
and the belt.

339
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.561
We got this chick. She's nothing.

340
00:27:26.639 --> 00:27:28.766
Tiffany Stone.

341
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.379
Cindy, listen to me. I know
you're scared but I believe in you.

342
00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:38.747
You can win this.

343
00:27:39.752 --> 00:27:41.447
Let's go.

344
00:27:48.761 --> 00:27:52.754
Whoa, you do that one more time,
I'm taking a point off. You hear me?

345
00:27:55.034 --> 00:27:57.935
I've got it, I've got it.
Dude, check it out.

346
00:28:05.244 --> 00:28:06.768
I can't take it anymore.

347
00:28:18.057 --> 00:28:20.116
And that's when I lost my cool

348
00:28:20.192 --> 00:28:22.353
and made the biggest mistake of my life.

349
00:28:23.195 --> 00:28:24.594
Cindy, no!

350
00:28:25.898 --> 00:28:27.627
Look, a nickel.

351
00:29:19.885 --> 00:29:22.820
George! No!

352
00:29:25.758 --> 00:29:29.216
If I hadn't have thrown that punch,
none of it would have happened.

353
00:29:29.295 --> 00:29:32.560
- I blame myself for it all.
- As well you should.

354
00:29:32.631 --> 00:29:35.429
But, Cindy, the past is the past.

355
00:29:36.368 --> 00:29:38.598
Maybe you oughta think
about your future.

356
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:43.108
If I'm ever going to love again, it has
to be somebody who'll be there for me.

357
00:29:43.175 --> 00:29:46.542
I don't have a great track record
in that department. Ask my son.

358
00:29:46.612 --> 00:29:49.080
I have. What's an ass-clown?

359
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:55.252
That's not important. What matters
is I've let a lot of people down.

360
00:29:57.957 --> 00:30:00.050
- I should go.
- Wait.

361
00:30:02.328 --> 00:30:05.559
Maybe I'm just not meant to be happy.

362
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.901
But something about you
makes me wanna try.

363
00:30:29.455 --> 00:30:31.650
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

364
00:30:34.927 --> 00:30:36.952
Why is the sky so dark?

365
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:39.520
Why's the wind moving towards the storm?

366
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:43.495
Why don't any of us have dryers?

367
00:30:44.303 --> 00:30:46.771
I've never seen clouds like that before.

368
00:30:55.648 --> 00:30:57.548
- You OK?
- Yeah.

369
00:30:57.616 --> 00:31:01.017
Can you believe that thunder?
That storm is so fierce.

370
00:31:01.086 --> 00:31:03.850
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Me either.

371
00:31:03.923 --> 00:31:05.618
Imagine being out there.

372
00:31:07.326 --> 00:31:09.226
That last one sounded really close.

373
00:31:09.295 --> 00:31:12.458
Don't worry, lightning never strikes
the same place twice.

374
00:31:14.099 --> 00:31:16.829
- Where's Rachel?
- I thought she was with you.

375
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.198
Oh, there you are.

376
00:31:30.916 --> 00:31:33.908
OK. That's it. We're fine.

377
00:31:33.986 --> 00:31:36.511
That last bolt of lightning
smelled like a...

378
00:31:36.588 --> 00:31:38.579
Giant turd.

379
00:31:39.658 --> 00:31:41.649
Yes, the lightning.

380
00:31:42.928 --> 00:31:44.987
I'll go look for Robbie.

381
00:31:49.468 --> 00:31:51.561
Turn it in again, see if it'll start.

382
00:31:51.637 --> 00:31:54.572
What's going on?
The car's just not working.

383
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.368
Start.

384
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.808
My bowels have stopped moving.

385
00:32:04.316 --> 00:32:06.250
- Why?
- How's it going, Marvin?

386
00:32:06.318 --> 00:32:08.218
Car was just working, now it's dead.

387
00:32:08.287 --> 00:32:10.687
- Try changing the solenoid.
- Good idea.

388
00:32:11.991 --> 00:32:13.356
Death to America!

389
00:32:14.994 --> 00:32:15.983
Aw, shit.

390
00:32:18.864 --> 00:32:20.354
Kill him!

391
00:32:38.083 --> 00:32:39.209
Run!

392
00:33:29.068 --> 00:33:30.831
Beautiful outfit.

393
00:33:32.104 --> 00:33:33.594
Thanks.

394
00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:37.834
- Move your ass, G.
- Where y'all going?

395
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.991
Hello.

396
00:33:58.297 --> 00:33:59.525
Harroh?

397
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.063
Hibachi Benihana teriyaki?

398
00:34:04.036 --> 00:34:06.596
Nagasaki Okinawa Hokkaido Yokohama.

399
00:34:08.273 --> 00:34:10.537
Karate judo sumo samurai?

400
00:34:11.276 --> 00:34:14.609
Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Subaru.

401
00:34:15.948 --> 00:34:18.508
Hara-kiri tsunami. Kamikaze banzai.

402
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:22.717
Yamaha Nikon. Casio Aiwa.

403
00:34:24.156 --> 00:34:27.956
Minolta Hitachi Seiko Toshiba.

404
00:34:28.794 --> 00:34:30.523
Buddha! Shiitake kimono!

405
00:34:31.296 --> 00:34:34.754
Tempura sushi sashimi...

406
00:34:36.235 --> 00:34:37.259
Fujitsu!

407
00:34:44.176 --> 00:34:46.406
I can't read that.

408
00:34:47.446 --> 00:34:49.311
That's better.

409
00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:59.016
Robbie, Dad's home.

410
00:35:03.362 --> 00:35:05.353
What is it? What's going on?

411
00:35:19.211 --> 00:35:21.076
Talk to me. What's happening?

412
00:35:21.146 --> 00:35:24.081
- There's no time to explain.
- Alien attack!

413
00:35:24.149 --> 00:35:26.777
Well, actually, that about sums it up.

414
00:35:26.852 --> 00:35:29.582
Fill this up with food.
We're leaving in 60 seconds.

415
00:35:34.026 --> 00:35:35.357
My ass.

416
00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.724
Penis.

417
00:35:40.566 --> 00:35:41.794
We gotta go.

418
00:35:47.472 --> 00:35:49.201
- Cindy.
- Tom.

419
00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:52.741
- Where are you going?
- Someone's out there.

420
00:35:52.811 --> 00:35:56.178
Someone who knows a way to stop this.
You wouldn't understand.

421
00:35:56.248 --> 00:35:58.773
- I understand.
- Come with me.

422
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.841
I'd like to, but my kids...

423
00:36:00.919 --> 00:36:03.114
I guess this is goodbye.

424
00:36:03.188 --> 00:36:05.952
When this is all over,
promise me you'll find me.

425
00:36:06.024 --> 00:36:07.548
That you'll never forget me.

426
00:36:07.626 --> 00:36:10.186
That you won't give up
until I'm back in your arms.

427
00:36:10.262 --> 00:36:11.991
Alive?

428
00:36:12.064 --> 00:36:14.294
- Yes.
- I promise.

429
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:19.798
Goodbye, Cindy.

430
00:36:24.343 --> 00:36:26.573
Hey, wait.

431
00:36:27.446 --> 00:36:30.176
A solenoid. For luck.

432
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.551
Marvin, did you put a solenoid in?

433
00:36:43.629 --> 00:36:45.859
Yeah, I got one from that crackhead.

434
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:47.228
- Get in.
- Why should we?

435
00:36:47.299 --> 00:36:51.599
Because you're my responsibility now
and like it or not, I'm all you've got.

436
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.707
Hey.

437
00:36:58.443 --> 00:37:00.070
Hey, what are you doing?

438
00:37:00.145 --> 00:37:03.080
- Get in the car, Marvin.
- Tom, stop joking around.

439
00:37:03.148 --> 00:37:05.616
Get in the car, Marvin,
or you're gonna die.

440
00:37:06.652 --> 00:37:08.017
OK, fine.

441
00:37:10.555 --> 00:37:12.022
No, wait for me to...

442
00:37:13.058 --> 00:37:15.526
- Still locked.
- Why are you reaching for the...

443
00:37:15.594 --> 00:37:17.687
- What do you mean?
- All right, on three.

444
00:37:17.763 --> 00:37:19.594
- All right.
- One, two...

445
00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:22.563
- Why did you do it on three?
- You said three.

446
00:37:22.634 --> 00:37:24.795
One, two, three, open the door.

447
00:37:26.038 --> 00:37:28.302
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm trying to get in!

448
00:37:28.373 --> 00:37:30.068
One, two...

449
00:37:30.142 --> 00:37:32.610
Please don't do that.
Listen, you go on three.

450
00:37:32.678 --> 00:37:34.646
That's what I've been doing!

451
00:37:34.713 --> 00:37:36.305
Don't reach when I reach!

452
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:38.815
- OK, do I still go on four?
- When I say three.

453
00:37:38.884 --> 00:37:42.047
You don't worry about four.
You got all the time in the world.

454
00:37:43.722 --> 00:37:46.691
Fine. I'll take the next one.
That work for you?

455
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.989
- Jesus.
- Attitude.

456
00:37:51.897 --> 00:37:53.888
Seriously, I'd rather be dead.

457
00:37:56.368 --> 00:37:58.529
"A girl had a pet duck."

458
00:37:58.603 --> 00:38:01.197
"She fed and took care of her pet duck."

459
00:38:01.273 --> 00:38:04.504
"But one day, the duck got loose
and ran away from the girl."

460
00:38:05.477 --> 00:38:08.071
"The duck ran down the road
and kept running,

461
00:38:08.146 --> 00:38:09.704
until he found a pond."

462
00:38:10.449 --> 00:38:15.716
Mr. President, we've just received word
the planet is under attack by aliens.

463
00:38:15.787 --> 00:38:17.277
Uh-huh. OK.

464
00:38:19.124 --> 00:38:22.355
Sir, they've already wiped out
some of our cities.

465
00:38:22.427 --> 00:38:24.691
If nothing is done, they'll kill us all.

466
00:38:24.763 --> 00:38:26.993
I see. I'll handle that in a minute,

467
00:38:27.065 --> 00:38:30.466
but right now, I need to find out
what's happening with the duck.

468
00:38:30.535 --> 00:38:34.471
Sir, with each passing moment,
more people will die.

469
00:38:34.539 --> 00:38:39.203
The people are gonna die regardless, but
this duck still has a fighting chance.

470
00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:43.876
I've read the story before,
Mr. President.

471
00:38:44.549 --> 00:38:46.278
The duck dies.

472
00:38:48.353 --> 00:38:50.514
My God! That's horrible.

473
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:53.615
Mr. President, the aliens.
We're under attack.

474
00:38:53.692 --> 00:38:56.559
You mean all of these
children's parents could be dead?

475
00:38:59.398 --> 00:39:02.333
Let's go on to another story,
Rumpleforeskin.

476
00:39:02.734 --> 00:39:05.498
Stiltskin, sir. We have to get you
to the White House.

477
00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:08.767
I just don't get kids.
Remind me to sign that abortion bill.

478
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.307
Yes, sir.

479
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:25.353
You may leave
through the forward exit doors

480
00:39:25.424 --> 00:39:27.824
or the gaping hole
in the side of the plane.

481
00:39:27.893 --> 00:39:32.193
We appreciate you flying with
Southern Coast Air. Thank you.

482
00:39:32.264 --> 00:39:33.595
Hello?

483
00:39:36.868 --> 00:39:39.462
Hey, that's mine. I found it.

484
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.938
- Cindy?
- Brenda?

485
00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:47.570
Oh, my God. It's been so long.

486
00:39:47.646 --> 00:39:49.807
Yeah. Too long.

487
00:39:49.881 --> 00:39:53.647
- I thought you were dead.
- Oh, I thought you were dead too.

488
00:39:54.753 --> 00:39:56.482
Were you on this plane?

489
00:39:56.555 --> 00:40:00.582
No, I'm trying to get a good story. I'm
a reporter now, I work for local news.

490
00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:03.093
Wow, you're really doing well
for yourself.

491
00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:05.925
I was on assignment.
Take a look at this.

492
00:40:06.765 --> 00:40:08.460
Here's Detroit.

493
00:40:09.835 --> 00:40:11.803
And here's Detroit after the attack.

494
00:40:15.474 --> 00:40:17.135
Oh, my God.

495
00:40:18.043 --> 00:40:20.034
The attack was devastating.

496
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:22.705
It's over, Cindy,
humanity has lost the war.

497
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:24.874
No, no, there's still hope.

498
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.851
I have reason to believe someone here
has the answers.

499
00:40:27.919 --> 00:40:29.910
Even a way for us to fight back.

500
00:40:31.156 --> 00:40:33.624
Come on. It'll make a great story.

501
00:40:34.526 --> 00:40:38.257
Maybe. But how are we supposed
to get there? None of these cars work.

502
00:40:38.692 --> 00:40:40.660
Wait, see if this works.

503
00:40:43.663 --> 00:40:46.962
Hey, I got the last running car
in New York!

504
00:40:47.033 --> 00:40:49.763
This is how I roll, bitches!

505
00:40:55.108 --> 00:40:57.633
You're right, Cindy,
that worked pretty well.

506
00:41:08.822 --> 00:41:10.687
Look at all the injured.

507
00:41:10.757 --> 00:41:12.384
It's so sad.

508
00:41:13.193 --> 00:41:14.922
...big-ass rat, man.

509
00:41:16.162 --> 00:41:19.928
- That sewer took forever to fix.
- I'm gonna need a hot bath after all...

510
00:41:21.234 --> 00:41:23.327
What the hell happened here?

511
00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:29.470
- Zombies!
- Damn!

512
00:41:31.378 --> 00:41:32.811
Let's go.

513
00:41:34.247 --> 00:41:35.714
Don't let 'em bite you!

514
00:41:35.782 --> 00:41:38.774
Good news:
They can still feel electricity.

515
00:41:38.852 --> 00:41:41.980
Grandma?
The zombies have got my grandma!

516
00:41:42.055 --> 00:41:44.455
Die, Grandma! Die! Die!

517
00:41:44.524 --> 00:41:46.515
I loved you!

518
00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.549
Mahalik?

519
00:41:48.628 --> 00:41:50.960
Look what they did to my grandmama!

520
00:41:55.902 --> 00:41:57.870
That woman raised me from birth.

521
00:42:05.745 --> 00:42:08.043
Hey, he's got a car. He's got a car.

522
00:42:09.416 --> 00:42:11.213
The car! Get the keys!

523
00:42:11.284 --> 00:42:15.311
This isn't my car. I would, but I can't.
It's not my car. It's not my car.

524
00:42:16.055 --> 00:42:19.786
Don't worry, kids, the doors are locked,
there's no way they can...

525
00:42:19.859 --> 00:42:24.091
build a robot out of chocolate, but
that's just common sense. Oh, waiter.

526
00:42:25.098 --> 00:42:27.032
- Daddy!
- Kids!

527
00:42:35.942 --> 00:42:37.204
Why?

528
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:40.570
Well... Get back!

529
00:42:41.514 --> 00:42:42.708
Get back.

530
00:42:46.519 --> 00:42:48.544
Give me the gun, I'm taking the car.

531
00:42:49.389 --> 00:42:51.380
What do I do about him?

532
00:42:51.458 --> 00:42:53.756
I don't want the car, I just need a gun.

533
00:42:53.827 --> 00:42:56.022
No way I'm giving up the gun.
I want the car.

534
00:42:56.663 --> 00:43:00.190
So you need a gun and you want a car.

535
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.462
- What do you want?
- Well, I've never owned a knife.

536
00:43:04.337 --> 00:43:06.202
OK, let's all switch on three.

537
00:43:06.272 --> 00:43:08.706
One, two, three.

538
00:43:12.245 --> 00:43:14.611
- Is this right?
- I don't think so.

539
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.810
Dad, they're taking the car.

540
00:43:21.688 --> 00:43:24.350
Yes, well, let's keep going.

541
00:43:25.058 --> 00:43:27.788
What? That's it? You're giving up?

542
00:43:27.861 --> 00:43:32.628
Yeah, that's right. You want a hero,
you go find something else.

543
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.733
Why?

544
00:43:37.303 --> 00:43:38.964
Let's go.

545
00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:41.534
Now, let me get this straight.

546
00:43:41.608 --> 00:43:45.100
The girl hugged the duck
and then it dies?

547
00:43:45.745 --> 00:43:48.213
Mr. President,
the nation is under attack.

548
00:43:48.281 --> 00:43:49.976
Get me Homer Landskirty.

549
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.084
You mean Homeland Security?

550
00:43:53.152 --> 00:43:56.781
Sir, this woman was an eyewitness
to one of the attacks.

551
00:43:56.856 --> 00:43:59.450
- What can you tell us?
- They're indestructible.

552
00:43:59.526 --> 00:44:02.086
The clothing was burned off
everyone's bodies.

553
00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:04.459
There were naked people everywhere.

554
00:44:04.998 --> 00:44:07.432
- Were you naked?
- No.

555
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.526
Thank God, some good news at last.
Get her a souvenir.

556
00:44:31.157 --> 00:44:34.615
Lil' Kim. Lil' Kim got my sandwich.

557
00:44:35.795 --> 00:44:37.956
Look out, Russell Crowe's got a phone!

558
00:44:39.699 --> 00:44:41.667
R. Kelly, don't pee on me.

559
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:44.900
My lovely lady lumps!

560
00:44:46.072 --> 00:44:48.267
- Where are we?
- I'm not sure.

561
00:44:48.908 --> 00:44:52.469
I think we're close.
It's supposed to be near Mile 62.

562
00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.113
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's just...

563
00:44:58.017 --> 00:45:00.212
I met this guy.

564
00:45:00.286 --> 00:45:03.380
And I wonder if he's safe.
Oh, you'd love him, Brenda.

565
00:45:03.456 --> 00:45:06.118
What's his name?
I might have already loved him.

566
00:45:07.293 --> 00:45:09.887
- Tom Ryan.
- Yep, did him.

567
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.693
- Big, fat Chinese guy?
- No. No.

568
00:45:14.834 --> 00:45:18.235
But he is the kind of guy I'd like
to share the rest of my life with.

569
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.302
Cindy! Look!

570
00:45:33.786 --> 00:45:36.016
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

571
00:45:36.089 --> 00:45:39.547
But the boy's father's in there.
We'll have to sneak our way in.

572
00:45:39.626 --> 00:45:41.753
We won't blend in dressed like this.

573
00:45:41.828 --> 00:45:43.090
Brenda, look.

574
00:45:43.162 --> 00:45:45.722
- He's a wonderful boy, isn't he?
- Yes.

575
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.958
Ezekiel? Ezekiel, where are you?

576
00:46:23.936 --> 00:46:26.496
Ezekiel, shall we have a foot race?

577
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.032
No cheating.

578
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:53.789
That's him.

579
00:46:53.866 --> 00:46:55.527
He's cute.

580
00:46:58.538 --> 00:47:00.403
Friends. Friends.

581
00:47:00.473 --> 00:47:03.965
Do not fear the noise of Those Of Whom
We Do Not Speak.

582
00:47:04.043 --> 00:47:06.238
There is a gentle truce
between our village

583
00:47:06.312 --> 00:47:08.837
and the creatures beyond our borders.

584
00:47:08.915 --> 00:47:11.315
Now, who would like to say grace?

585
00:47:13.753 --> 00:47:15.220
Ezekiel.

586
00:47:15.822 --> 00:47:17.255
Pee-pee.

587
00:47:17.957 --> 00:47:19.948
Pee-pee and vagina!

588
00:47:24.197 --> 00:47:26.028
Amen.

589
00:47:34.574 --> 00:47:36.667
- Father?
- Holly.

590
00:47:38.644 --> 00:47:43.081
For what purpose do you interrupt
the celebration of the...

591
00:47:43.149 --> 00:47:47.609
domestic partnership
of Mordecai and Hoss?

592
00:47:47.687 --> 00:47:50.212
The guards caught two outsiders
near the cabin.

593
00:47:56.963 --> 00:48:00.626
The question of the outsiders
is now at hand.

594
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.295
But first, Martha,
have you some tidings?

595
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:08.568
Nathaniel Winston and Alice Smith
have informed me of their intentions.

596
00:48:09.342 --> 00:48:12.072
He intends to have sex with her
as soon as possible.

597
00:48:12.145 --> 00:48:15.740
She intends to put up a mild fight
and then give in.

598
00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:24.650
Silence.

599
00:48:24.724 --> 00:48:26.954
We have more important matters
to discuss.

600
00:48:27.026 --> 00:48:30.086
I fear that the presence
of the outsiders

601
00:48:30.163 --> 00:48:33.462
will attract Those Of Whom
We Do Not Speak.

602
00:48:34.967 --> 00:48:38.061
If you talk about Those Of Whom
We Do Not Speak,

603
00:48:38.137 --> 00:48:41.072
have you not spoken about that
of which we do not talk?

604
00:48:42.241 --> 00:48:47.645
Do not speak of that of about which
we talk of not speaking...

605
00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:49.470
about.

606
00:48:58.724 --> 00:49:02.421
Elder Hale, we should welcome
the outsiders among us.

607
00:49:02.495 --> 00:49:05.953
Jeremiah, ought not your tongue be held?

608
00:49:06.032 --> 00:49:07.966
I am sorry, Elder Hale,

609
00:49:08.868 --> 00:49:12.998
but sometimes my tongue wiggles
beyond my ability to control it.

610
00:49:15.608 --> 00:49:18.600
This is a problem with which I have had
much experience.

611
00:49:18.678 --> 00:49:21.841
Maybe I could help him in a room
in which there are no others.

612
00:49:23.249 --> 00:49:25.444
Or you can all watch,
I don't give a shit.

613
00:49:26.552 --> 00:49:28.452
Silence.

614
00:49:28.521 --> 00:49:30.489
The elders will consult.

615
00:49:41.267 --> 00:49:43.098
Much better.

616
00:50:15.801 --> 00:50:18.770
I'm not in my house, am I?

617
00:50:20.172 --> 00:50:21.161
No.

618
00:50:24.543 --> 00:50:28.809
Outsiders, we have decided
to let you stay with us.

619
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:33.909
But now that you are a part
of our village, understand this:

620
00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:36.544
You may never leave.

621
00:50:37.189 --> 00:50:38.816
No! No!

622
00:50:39.692 --> 00:50:42.957
How did your son die?
The world is at stake!

623
00:50:43.029 --> 00:50:45.896
- You know what to do.
- Was it you? Did you kill him?

624
00:50:45.965 --> 00:50:48.399
This is some shit
up with which we will not put!

625
00:50:52.638 --> 00:50:55.004
This village isn't what it used to be.

626
00:50:57.743 --> 00:51:00.678
Just hours after the devastating
alien attack,

627
00:51:00.746 --> 00:51:03.613
world leaders have gathered
at the United Nations.

628
00:51:04.317 --> 00:51:06.877
In this, Mankind's darkest hour,

629
00:51:06.953 --> 00:51:11.117
the human race has turned as one
to the wisdom and leadership

630
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.920
of the President of the United States.

631
00:51:13.993 --> 00:51:17.053
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

632
00:51:17.997 --> 00:51:21.797
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- They mean you, sir.

633
00:51:21.867 --> 00:51:23.494
Oh, yes, of course.

634
00:51:32.845 --> 00:51:37.111
So, an Indian, a Frenchman and the Pope
are all on a plane.

635
00:51:37.183 --> 00:51:41.085
The pilot says
"Hey, are any of you not circumcised?"

636
00:51:41.153 --> 00:51:45.249
So the Pope lifts up his robe and says
"Shut up, stupid,

637
00:51:45.324 --> 00:51:47.690
you don't even speak English."

638
00:51:48.127 --> 00:51:51.062
The Israeli asked the Japanese guy
to open his eyes,

639
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:55.123
but the man says "I'm not squinting, you
crazy Jew. You sold me cheap glasses."

640
00:51:56.002 --> 00:51:59.494
What's the difference between a Belgian
and a lump of dog shit?

641
00:51:59.572 --> 00:52:03.133
The Belgian drinks wine
but the dog shit smells good.

642
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:13.111
On a serious note,
I'm here today at the... un,

643
00:52:13.185 --> 00:52:14.982
because Earth has been attacked.

644
00:52:15.054 --> 00:52:17.921
I'm happy to report we may have found
a way to fight back.

645
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.290
My military advisors at the Pentagram
have managed to do the impossible.

646
00:52:22.361 --> 00:52:25.558
They have captured
one of the alien heat-ray guns.

647
00:52:25.631 --> 00:52:29.897
The heat ray destroys the body,
leaving behind nothing but clothes.

648
00:52:29.969 --> 00:52:33.632
Our engineers have managed to reverse
the polarity of the weapon

649
00:52:33.706 --> 00:52:38.040
in the hopes that it can now be
turned against the alien invaders.

650
00:52:44.617 --> 00:52:46.482
Now, where were we?

651
00:52:46.552 --> 00:52:50.147
Ah, yes. We expect the alien shields
will be vulnerable

652
00:52:50.222 --> 00:52:52.281
to this reconfigured weapon.

653
00:52:53.492 --> 00:52:55.426
People, please.

654
00:52:56.595 --> 00:52:58.688
Please, please.

655
00:52:58.764 --> 00:53:03.030
People. Now, I know that this new
technology might seem frightening,

656
00:53:03.102 --> 00:53:07.971
but I believe that deep down inside,
this heat cannon is our best chance.

657
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.167
Let me give you a demonstration.

658
00:53:11.343 --> 00:53:13.311
Let's see if this thing is plugged in.

659
00:53:16.515 --> 00:53:20.349
It's not a very pretty sight.
Everything's loose and flapping around.

660
00:53:20.419 --> 00:53:22.353
Look at this little pink thing.

661
00:53:29.428 --> 00:53:32.625
Someone get some lubricant.
We'll slather it around in here.

662
00:53:47.746 --> 00:53:50.909
Harper.
Good God, these people are all naked.

663
00:53:50.983 --> 00:53:53.417
Have you no shame?
Have you no decency?

664
00:53:54.153 --> 00:53:55.381
Sir, you're naked too.

665
00:53:55.454 --> 00:53:58.389
I am? I thought this was
a wrinkly leather coat.

666
00:53:58.457 --> 00:54:00.220
- Sir!
- These aren't buttons?

667
00:54:00.292 --> 00:54:03.318
- No.
- I've been pulling this like a zipper.

668
00:54:03.395 --> 00:54:04.953
Mr. President, please.

669
00:54:05.664 --> 00:54:07.633
There goes that duck again.

670
00:54:13.572 --> 00:54:15.540
Yo, man, you see this red weed?

671
00:54:16.075 --> 00:54:17.542
No.

672
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:20.272
- Dad, how much further till Mom's?
- I don't know.

673
00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.110
I'm not sure how much longer
I can carry your sister.

674
00:54:24.183 --> 00:54:26.777
I've been walking this entire time.

675
00:54:27.386 --> 00:54:30.253
- Then who the hell is...
- I'll pay you.

676
00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:33.988
- Stay close, Rachel.
- Dad, look!

677
00:54:36.495 --> 00:54:38.895
Hey, hey, you guys! I want to help.

678
00:54:38.964 --> 00:54:40.158
Robbie!

679
00:54:40.232 --> 00:54:41.290
Oh, no.

680
00:54:42.768 --> 00:54:46.295
Don't move. Stay right there.
I'll be right back.

681
00:54:46.372 --> 00:54:48.738
Hey! Hey, you guys! I want to help.

682
00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.834
Awesome!

683
00:54:53.512 --> 00:54:54.501
Wait!

684
00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.380
- Are you crazy?
- No, they'll pay for half my college.

685
00:54:59.752 --> 00:55:01.583
Kick-ass!

686
00:55:01.654 --> 00:55:03.349
Robbie.

687
00:55:03.422 --> 00:55:05.515
- Yes!
- What's the matter with you?

688
00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:08.822
Hey, look at that guy.
This is so cool!

689
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.219
Robbie!

690
00:55:12.831 --> 00:55:14.298
Robbie!

691
00:55:20.272 --> 00:55:22.604
Rachel!

692
00:55:23.209 --> 00:55:25.040
Little girl, are you alone?

693
00:55:25.945 --> 00:55:29.278
You need to come with me.
I'll keep you safe. Right, kids?

694
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:32.943
- Do you have a little brother?
- Get away from her.

695
00:55:36.956 --> 00:55:38.856
Run away, kids!

696
00:55:38.924 --> 00:55:41.290
Toward the tripod if you have to!

697
00:55:44.563 --> 00:55:46.155
Over here.

698
00:55:46.832 --> 00:55:48.823
Follow me to safety.

699
00:55:51.103 --> 00:55:52.502
Follow me to safety.

700
00:55:52.571 --> 00:55:56.302
- I don't know about this.
- I'm an excellent judge of character.

701
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:27.395
That's it. Oh, Brenda.

702
00:56:28.607 --> 00:56:30.541
You did it!

703
00:56:30.609 --> 00:56:33.908
You have learned quickly
and produced splendid butter.

704
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.880
Are you sure you've not churned before?

705
00:56:36.949 --> 00:56:39.440
We don't call it churning
where I come from.

706
00:56:43.389 --> 00:56:45.823
The scourge is upon us.

707
00:56:47.159 --> 00:56:48.626
Pee-pee! Vagina!

708
00:57:25.064 --> 00:57:26.156
Hey!

709
00:57:27.132 --> 00:57:29.293
You're not monsters.

710
00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:32.393
Old Lady Henderson?

711
00:57:33.138 --> 00:57:34.833
And Pigface Joe.

712
00:57:41.046 --> 00:57:43.514
- What happened?
- It is Henry.

713
00:57:43.582 --> 00:57:45.573
He has suffered a heart attack.

714
00:57:46.218 --> 00:57:48.186
Brought on by this knife.

715
00:57:50.522 --> 00:57:53.491
- Who did this?
- It was Ezekiel.

716
00:57:55.394 --> 00:57:57.453
Henry, you need a hospital.

717
00:57:57.529 --> 00:57:59.497
It's not too late, we can help you.

718
00:57:59.965 --> 00:58:03.059
Perhaps you could start
by not leaning on the knife.

719
00:58:06.238 --> 00:58:10.174
Please, leave me alone with Cindy
and Brenda. I have much to tell them.

720
00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:15.143
Listen carefully to me.

721
00:58:15.214 --> 00:58:17.205
I am not long for this world.

722
00:58:17.282 --> 00:58:19.113
- Pussy.
- Brenda.

723
00:58:19.184 --> 00:58:23.143
What? 50 Cent got shot nine times,
he's still walking around.

724
00:58:23.222 --> 00:58:26.248
Tell me, Henry, who killed the boy?
Was it you?

725
00:58:26.325 --> 00:58:30.193
No. I loved him
and his mother very much.

726
00:58:30.262 --> 00:58:33.163
I should have been with him
when he died.

727
00:58:33.232 --> 00:58:36.759
- It was horrible.
- What happened? You must tell me.

728
00:58:36.835 --> 00:58:39.099
They went to a boxing match.

729
00:58:39.171 --> 00:58:42.231
It was a Women's Championship
title fight.

730
00:58:43.075 --> 00:58:45.236
And there was a terrible accident.

731
00:58:45.878 --> 00:58:47.743
Oh, my God!

732
00:58:58.857 --> 00:59:00.882
Only in America!

733
00:59:05.431 --> 00:59:08.195
All this time
I've been searching for his killer,

734
00:59:08.267 --> 00:59:10.258
when it was me, Brenda.

735
00:59:10.335 --> 00:59:12.235
It was all my fault.

736
00:59:12.304 --> 00:59:14.966
Henry, your son told me
that if I found his killer

737
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.065
I would know how to defeat the aliens.

738
00:59:17.142 --> 00:59:20.077
And he was right. Don't you see?

739
00:59:20.145 --> 00:59:22.045
All you have to do is...

740
00:59:26.552 --> 00:59:28.645
Who the hell let his ass out of jail?

741
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:31.188
His brother, the sheriff.

742
00:59:34.626 --> 00:59:36.423
Freakin' A.

743
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:45.432
- There you go, sweetie.
- We're gonna die, aren't we?

744
00:59:45.504 --> 00:59:48.132
Hey, nothing's gonna happen to you.

745
00:59:48.207 --> 00:59:51.608
- I haven't lost anyone yet.
- You've lost Robbie.

746
00:59:52.277 --> 00:59:53.744
Except Robbie.

747
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.177
None of that matters now.
What's important is I'm here with you.

748
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.480
Try and get some sleep, OK?

749
01:00:01.086 --> 01:00:02.986
Sing me Lullaby And Goodnight.

750
01:00:05.023 --> 01:00:06.650
I don't know that one.

751
01:00:06.725 --> 01:00:09.285
Sing me Hushabye Mountain.

752
01:00:09.361 --> 01:00:12.421
I'm sorry, I don't know that one either.

753
01:00:23.175 --> 01:00:25.075
If you want this money

754
01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:27.509
Then you gotta be a Badd bitch

755
01:00:29.281 --> 01:00:32.182
Shake that ass for a tip
if you a Badd bitch

756
01:00:32.918 --> 01:00:36.012
Drop down to the floor
if you a Badd bitch

757
01:00:36.855 --> 01:00:38.948
Oh, no, she ain't no ho

758
01:00:39.024 --> 01:00:41.584
She a Badd bitch...

759
01:00:49.067 --> 01:00:51.501
Hey. Come on in.

760
01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:53.561
Have a seat.

761
01:00:54.306 --> 01:00:56.900
- My name's Oliver.
- Tom Ryan.

762
01:00:57.676 --> 01:00:59.769
- Are you afraid?
- Of course I'm afraid.

763
01:00:59.845 --> 01:01:02.143
I'm not. I've been around death plenty.

764
01:01:02.214 --> 01:01:04.648
But this is different. This is a war.

765
01:01:04.716 --> 01:01:07.014
No, it's an extermination.

766
01:01:07.085 --> 01:01:10.384
It's no more of a war than there's a war
between men and maggots,

767
01:01:10.455 --> 01:01:12.480
or dragons and wolves,

768
01:01:12.558 --> 01:01:16.324
or men riding dragons
throwing wolves at maggots.

769
01:01:17.529 --> 01:01:20.362
Tom, can't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

770
01:01:20.432 --> 01:01:22.457
These aliens must have a weakness.

771
01:01:22.534 --> 01:01:26.163
I heard that the Japs
killed a few of them over in Kikkoman.

772
01:01:26.238 --> 01:01:30.004
- Kikkoman. That's a soy sauce.
- Right, yeah. Low sodium.

773
01:01:30.075 --> 01:01:33.909
What I'm trying to say is you and I
should be fighting these things.

774
01:01:33.979 --> 01:01:36.504
We should be coming up
from under the ground.

775
01:01:36.582 --> 01:01:39.949
We'll build our own tripods.
Ours will have four legs.

776
01:01:49.895 --> 01:01:51.886
Dad.

777
01:02:16.288 --> 01:02:17.346
Daddy!

778
01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:20.223
Rachel!

779
01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:24.353
Rachel!

780
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:26.420
Rachel!

781
01:02:36.108 --> 01:02:38.770
What's the secret, Brenda?
What am I missing?

782
01:02:41.246 --> 01:02:43.942
Please! More fake monsters?

783
01:03:10.509 --> 01:03:12.568
Help! Help!

784
01:03:15.981 --> 01:03:18.211
I promised I'd find you, didn't I?

785
01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:35.727
Where are we? What is this?

786
01:03:35.801 --> 01:03:38.736
Some kind of basket
attached to the tripod.

787
01:03:39.104 --> 01:03:40.332
Jesus!

788
01:03:40.405 --> 01:03:42.396
I know. It's horrible.

789
01:03:42.474 --> 01:03:45.466
Why? What are the aliens gonna do to us?

790
01:03:45.544 --> 01:03:49.139
I don't know, but they're taking
everyone. Young, old, rich, poor.

791
01:03:49.214 --> 01:03:50.203
Chingy.

792
01:04:02.394 --> 01:04:04.555
- Rachel!
- No!

793
01:04:20.078 --> 01:04:22.706
- Am I dead?
- You're not dead.

794
01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:35.016
- Brenda!
- Cindy!

795
01:04:35.961 --> 01:04:38.623
Hey. Could be worse.

796
01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.697
Do you wanna switch?

797
01:04:43.769 --> 01:04:44.758
OK.

798
01:04:45.504 --> 01:04:47.699
Brenda, look!

799
01:04:47.773 --> 01:04:51.265
I don't believe it.
The aliens killed a dinosaur!

800
01:04:55.514 --> 01:05:00.383
Hello, humans. Welcome to the inside
of the command tripod.

801
01:05:00.452 --> 01:05:03.148
Where's Rachel?
What have you done with my daughter?

802
01:05:03.221 --> 01:05:06.850
All in good time, Tom.
But first, I want to play a game.

803
01:05:07.559 --> 01:05:10.756
The devices you wear
will trigger in 60 seconds.

804
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:14.758
The switch on the wall behind Cindy
will disable them.

805
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.827
But where is the key?
I'll give you a hint, Cindy.

806
01:05:20.272 --> 01:05:22.001
Let the game begin.

807
01:05:24.176 --> 01:05:25.803
I don't get it.

808
01:05:25.877 --> 01:05:30.405
OK. Maybe this will help you "see".

809
01:05:37.656 --> 01:05:39.487
You want me to...

810
01:05:39.558 --> 01:05:41.116
...cut something?

811
01:05:41.193 --> 01:05:43.855
That should be obvious, yes.

812
01:05:46.832 --> 01:05:47.958
No.

813
01:05:50.068 --> 01:05:53.128
No. The key is behind your eye, OK?

814
01:05:59.077 --> 01:06:01.705
Zoltar, get in here.
This one's gonna do it.

815
01:06:06.451 --> 01:06:08.442
Fake eye.

816
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.954
Bad bar fight, '96.

817
01:06:21.466 --> 01:06:23.491
I hope this doesn't come between us.

818
01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:26.493
Of course not.

819
01:06:32.277 --> 01:06:34.575
Is it too late for me to try this on?

820
01:06:34.646 --> 01:06:36.876
Silence. The game is not yet over.

821
01:06:39.651 --> 01:06:41.016
- Rachel!
- Daddy!

822
01:06:41.086 --> 01:06:42.713
Robbie.

823
01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:51.694
The only thing keeping
your children alive, Tom, is you.

824
01:06:52.297 --> 01:06:54.288
Well, we had a good run.

825
01:06:59.137 --> 01:07:02.231
- You weren't expecting that, were you?
- On the contrary,

826
01:07:02.307 --> 01:07:04.298
I was counting on it.

827
01:07:09.381 --> 01:07:12.077
I call it the Nutcracker.

828
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:14.079
Why?

829
01:07:15.854 --> 01:07:16.878
Of course.

830
01:07:22.861 --> 01:07:26.024
Tempura sushi sashimi...

831
01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:35.003
Oh, my gosh. Of course.

832
01:07:35.073 --> 01:07:37.598
Follow the blood. Henry was his stepdad.

833
01:07:37.676 --> 01:07:39.871
You're the little boy's real father.

834
01:07:39.945 --> 01:07:41.810
Where did you even meet her?

835
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.247
It was Spring Break in Cabo.
So what? I blended in.

836
01:07:45.317 --> 01:07:47.114
Seriously, who gives a crap?

837
01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:49.109
What's this?

838
01:07:50.956 --> 01:07:53.356
Enjoy your purple nurple, Tom.

839
01:07:56.561 --> 01:07:58.256
Your son wouldn't want this.

840
01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:01.493
His soul walks the Earth
because of the pain you're causing.

841
01:08:01.566 --> 01:08:03.932
No. I have crossed
a galaxy for revenge.

842
01:08:04.002 --> 01:08:06.163
But it's my fault. Let the others go.

843
01:08:06.237 --> 01:08:09.434
Oh, I don't think so.
Look upon him as he writhes...

844
01:08:09.507 --> 01:08:12.340
Hey, Cindy! Look, I'm on TV, y'all!

845
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:15.106
Check it out. I wanna give a shout
out to all my peeps.

846
01:08:17.515 --> 01:08:19.210
Have you lost your mind?

847
01:08:19.284 --> 01:08:21.718
No one... pimp-slaps... Brenda.

848
01:08:22.721 --> 01:08:24.655
Zoltar, help.

849
01:08:24.723 --> 01:08:26.714
This is some bullshit.

850
01:08:27.492 --> 01:08:30.928
I know you hold a grudge against
humanity for your son's death...

851
01:08:32.063 --> 01:08:33.360
A wet willy!

852
01:08:34.566 --> 01:08:36.625
...killing us won't bring your boy back.

853
01:08:36.701 --> 01:08:39.329
No, you will all pay
for what you have done.

854
01:08:39.404 --> 01:08:41.736
Besides, I've already built this thing.

855
01:08:43.842 --> 01:08:46.970
When the trap closes on you,
it will lock the chain in place.

856
01:08:47.045 --> 01:08:51.004
Your children will be saved,
but you will suffer a terrible death.

857
01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:53.676
Can you hang on to the ones you love?

858
01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:55.913
You have 60 seconds.

859
01:08:57.455 --> 01:09:00.015
- No.
- Don't worry, kids.

860
01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:02.082
I won't quit on you.

861
01:09:02.694 --> 01:09:07.256
It's OK to let go, Dad. All you ever had
to do was show that you loved me.

862
01:09:08.533 --> 01:09:10.797
And show me what it means to be a man.

863
01:09:10.869 --> 01:09:13.167
And show me that I could love again.

864
01:09:14.572 --> 01:09:16.335
We forgive you, Dad.

865
01:09:27.452 --> 01:09:29.386
The spikes, they stopped!

866
01:09:32.857 --> 01:09:34.722
- Kids.
- Daddy!

867
01:09:39.864 --> 01:09:42.856
Are you sparing our lives?

868
01:09:42.934 --> 01:09:47.337
Anyone can hold a grudge,
but it takes real courage to forgive.

869
01:09:47.405 --> 01:09:48.895
The invasion is over.

870
01:09:50.442 --> 01:09:54.378
- And?
- And I guess I'm sorry or something.

871
01:09:54.446 --> 01:09:56.107
Like you mean it.

872
01:09:57.048 --> 01:10:00.745
OK, I'm sorry for killing
millions of people. Whatever.

873
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.447
Wait! Where's Brenda?

874
01:10:07.192 --> 01:10:10.161
What? We're at peace now,
I was just sealing the deal.

875
01:10:11.996 --> 01:10:13.987
Come on, Brenda, let's go.

876
01:10:14.933 --> 01:10:17.993
Bye, Zoltar! Don't lose my number!

877
01:10:20.839 --> 01:10:22.932
Tell me you didn't catch something.

878
01:10:23.007 --> 01:10:25.635
Nah, it's cool.
She said she was a virgin.

879
01:10:28.046 --> 01:10:30.071
We are so fucked.

880
01:10:45.563 --> 01:10:46.996
Mommy!

881
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.167
Thank you.

882
01:10:56.074 --> 01:10:57.837
Hey, look, kids, Grandpa.

883
01:10:59.811 --> 01:11:01.540
No, that's my new husband.

884
01:11:08.753 --> 01:11:10.744
I think it's romantic.

885
01:11:10.822 --> 01:11:13.017
The way love can find anyone.

886
01:11:16.694 --> 01:11:20.152
And so love triumphed in the end

887
01:11:20.231 --> 01:11:22.461
and the invaders were destroyed.

888
01:11:22.534 --> 01:11:25.230
For this world, our world,

889
01:11:25.303 --> 01:11:27.533
is the world of Men.

890
01:11:27.605 --> 01:11:30.438
We have earned the right to live here.

891
01:11:30.508 --> 01:11:34.569
And as long as we love,
humanity will prevail.

892
01:11:34.646 --> 01:11:38.605
Each of our enemies
has failed in their quest to defeat us.

893
01:11:38.683 --> 01:11:43.211
Each has been undone
by their own nefarious plans.

894
01:11:43.955 --> 01:11:47.288
Among all worlds, across all galaxies,

895
01:11:47.358 --> 01:11:50.725
we stand above, we stand alone.

896
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:55.825
None can threaten our existence,
none can challenge our spirit.

897
01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:00.394
And why? Of all the qualities
that make us unique,

898
01:12:01.406 --> 01:12:03.897
it is love that is
our greatest strength.

899
01:12:03.975 --> 01:12:06.136
And because of love, Mankind...

900
01:12:10.515 --> 01:12:13.848
Thank you.
Hello and welcome to the show.

901
01:12:13.918 --> 01:12:17.615
We have got a very special man
with some very special news.

902
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:20.988
That's right, he's in the building.
The man who saved the world.

903
01:12:21.059 --> 01:12:24.358
Put your hands together for Tom Ryan!

904
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:27.489
Yes!

905
01:12:27.565 --> 01:12:29.556
My best friend.

906
01:12:44.716 --> 01:12:46.240
Wow.

907
01:12:46.317 --> 01:12:48.444
That's it? OK.

908
01:12:53.124 --> 01:12:55.820
- So, you're in love.
- I am. I'm in love.

909
01:13:02.533 --> 01:13:04.501
He's lost it. The boy's lost it.

910
01:13:12.844 --> 01:13:15.438
- You are adorable when you are in love.
- Thank you.

911
01:13:15.513 --> 01:13:17.777
- Tell us all about her.
- She's great.

912
01:13:17.849 --> 01:13:20.249
She's really terrific.
So it's complicated.

913
01:13:20.318 --> 01:13:22.650
You were saying that she's complex,
I guess.

914
01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.914
Shut up.

915
01:13:34.599 --> 01:13:36.829
You're insane. Tom Ryan is insane!

916
01:13:36.901 --> 01:13:38.493
I'm insane!

917
01:13:42.206 --> 01:13:43.537
Shoe.

918
01:13:48.613 --> 01:13:52.242
I love Cindy Campbell!
And I can jump on things!

919
01:13:58.856 --> 01:14:00.847
Yeah! Wowee! Wowee!

920
01:14:11.502 --> 01:14:13.629
OK, Tom, isn't Cindy here?

921
01:14:13.705 --> 01:14:16.469
I know she's here.
Cindy, I know you're in the building.

922
01:14:16.541 --> 01:14:18.532
Cindy! Cindy!

923
01:14:18.609 --> 01:14:20.600
Yeah, let's bring her out right now.

924
01:14:20.678 --> 01:14:23.306
I love this woman! I love this woman!
