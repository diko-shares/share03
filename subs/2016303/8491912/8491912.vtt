1
00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.372
I'm alone,
just as we agreed.

2
00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:41.406
Of course you are.

3
00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:43.442
You're very ambitious...

4
00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.010
and you know this story is gold.

5
00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:51.183
Did you bring it?

6
00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.318
You're no fan of
US intelligence.

7
00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:56.254
You're a little short
on the details.

8
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:57.988
It's a good thing we met.

9
00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:15.240
-How did you...
-Does it matter? They're real.

10
00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:19.311
No, you can't have them.

11
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:22.980
Yes, you can take photos.

12
00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:39.297
This type of scandal could
destroy the US.

13
00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:41.066
Yes.

14
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.702
Many will die.

15
00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.016
But you called me.

16
00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:02.387
You want this story out there.

17
00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:03.388
I do.

18
00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:05.457
But unfortunately for you...

19
00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:08.426
I want to be the one
to do the telling.

20
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.999
Is the CIA murdering
journalists?

21
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:19.937
German journalist Greta Becker
was found dead in a Greek hotel.

22
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.307
Sparking protests across Europe.

23
00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:24.442
The third such murder
in a month.

24
00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:29.347
Miss Becker was an
outspoken critic
of US intelligence
activities abroad.

25
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.284
Greek Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs...

26
00:02:32.517 --> 00:02:36.421
Kostas Leontaris,
pulled no punches
when asked about the incident.

27
00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:40.758
For decades, the United States
has shown zero regard

28
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:44.129
for the sovereignty
of other nations.

29
00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:49.301
But the days of the
CIA treating Europe
like the Wild West are over.

30
00:03:09.354 --> 00:03:10.288
Hey.

31
00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:11.722
It's nice of you to show up.

32
00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:13.458
I like to work at night.

33
00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:15.560
Because you have no life?

34
00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:17.662
Because it's easier to focus.

35
00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.097
What have you got for me?

36
00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:19.997
Jack and shit.

37
00:03:20.298 --> 00:03:23.435
The hotel Greta Becker
was staying at has no CCTV

38
00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:27.138
so I've scanned the
streets around
and the train station opposite.

39
00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.005
Nothing.

40
00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:31.109
I did see a nun
traveling with a full drum kit.

41
00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:32.843
That was a new one.

42
00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:35.946
Hey, I said I already
checked those.

43
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.882
I know.
But I might see something
you didn't.

44
00:04:19.957 --> 00:04:21.859
Holy shit.

45
00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:29.434
Sir, I've been trying
to reach you.

46
00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:30.934
Check your email.

47
00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:32.570
I'm in the middle of breakfast.

48
00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:33.538
This is urgent.

49
00:04:43.648 --> 00:04:44.783
What am I looking at?

50
00:04:44.848 --> 00:04:45.883
Security footage.

51
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:48.386
Thessaloniki train station,
two days ago.

52
00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:49.953
Our guys already combed this.

53
00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:51.523
Why are you wasting my time?

54
00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.058
Because they missed this.

55
00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.293
Victor Radek.

56
00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.962
Have you told Thessaloniki?

57
00:04:58.996 --> 00:05:00.332
I haven't told anyone.

58
00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.666
What do you know about him?

59
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.201
Most of his files were redacted.

60
00:05:03.234 --> 00:05:05.670
Civilian born in Greece
but grew up all over.

61
00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:08.139
Died eighteen months ago.

62
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.442
But they never did
find his body.

63
00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:12.444
He was a covert CIA operative

64
00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:15.846
working as an intermediary
between
the Russian and Greek Mafias.

65
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:17.881
Who ran him for us over there?

66
00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:53.284
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:55.353
Yeah, we're on it.

68
00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:56.354
We're on it.

69
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.457
Yeah, well, if we had more guys,
it would help.

70
00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:01.659
Yeah, I...

71
00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:03.294
Yeah, hold on a sec.

72
00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:05.830
Can I help you?

73
00:06:05.996 --> 00:06:07.298
Steve Vail.

74
00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.299
So?

75
00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.136
I'm the bricklayer.

76
00:06:46.304 --> 00:06:48.373
He'll have
the number five with

77
00:06:48.406 --> 00:06:51.042
provolone and some of
that fancy aioli.

78
00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:54.646
But hold the peppers.
It aggravates his indigestion.

79
00:06:55.814 --> 00:06:56.748
What do you want?

80
00:06:57.248 --> 00:06:59.517
Can't an old friend stop
by to say hello?

81
00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:01.619
Is that what we are?

82
00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:03.455
Friends, enemies.

83
00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:06.090
In our business, there's
no distinction.

84
00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:10.462
Someone's trying to
blackmail the CIA.

85
00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:13.097
They're sending messages
with bodies attached.

86
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:15.867
All journalists who have made
careers going after U.S

87
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.535
intelligence abroad.

88
00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:20.238
They're trying to make it look
like the CIA is doing
the killing.

89
00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:23.575
Whoever's doing the blackmailing
possesses classified information

90
00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:26.144
that could bring down
our entire global network.

91
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.046
We think it's Victor Radek.

92
00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:32.050
Radek's one of the most
dangerous men I've ever known

93
00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:33.651
but he never killed innocents.

94
00:07:33.718 --> 00:07:35.186
I watched him die.

95
00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:37.222
None of this tracks.

96
00:07:39.724 --> 00:07:41.559
Recognize this pretty face?

97
00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:43.294
Boris Popov.

98
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:45.263
Russian smuggler, bad breath.

99
00:07:45.563 --> 00:07:48.199
Two years ago, Popov died
in a boating accident

100
00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.835
outside of the port
of Thessaloniki.

101
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:52.036
Accident.

102
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.971
Right.

103
00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:54.305
Popov was a hit

104
00:07:54.806 --> 00:07:56.107
performed by Radek

105
00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:57.742
commissioned by the CIA.

106
00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:04.649
This photo of Popov was found
at the scene of Greta
Becker's murder.

107
00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:06.784
You know what this
means, don't you?

108
00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:08.520
It means Radek is back...

109
00:08:09.287 --> 00:08:10.688
And he's got secrets to tell.

110
00:08:10.722 --> 00:08:13.191
This is no longer
just a cursory fact-finding.

111
00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:14.859
We need to bring him in.

112
00:08:15.025 --> 00:08:18.263
That's why I want you
to go to Greece with her.

113
00:08:18.363 --> 00:08:19.264
What?

114
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.030
Sir-

115
00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:21.165
You're joking.

116
00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:23.701
You know his habits,
contacts, networks.

117
00:08:23.768 --> 00:08:25.069
I can brief someone else.

118
00:08:25.436 --> 00:08:27.205
Someone with more experience.

119
00:08:27.405 --> 00:08:29.140
We don't know who's compromised.

120
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.443
Right now, only the three of us
know that Radek is alive.

121
00:08:32.477 --> 00:08:33.444
It stays that way.

122
00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:35.780
Look I'm persona non grata
with the agency

123
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.715
I can't even enter
Greece legally.

124
00:08:37.749 --> 00:08:39.117
This isn't sanctioned, Vail.

125
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.952
We're doing it off the books.

126
00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:44.389
You'll be working
around the Greeks
and Interpol as well
as our own people.

127
00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:46.691
Sir, I really think that
you should reconsider

128
00:08:46.724 --> 00:08:49.394
sending someone
a little bit more credentialed.

129
00:08:49.427 --> 00:08:50.194
I agree.

130
00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:53.064
She wouldn't last 24
hours on the ground.

131
00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:54.499
I was talking about you.

132
00:08:54.532 --> 00:08:55.466
Enough.

133
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.635
This is your fuck up Vail

134
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:58.970
and you need to fix it.

135
00:08:59.003 --> 00:09:01.072
Before he starts coming for you.

136
00:09:04.442 --> 00:09:07.412
Unless, of course,
you want to do it
for your country.

137
00:09:09.414 --> 00:09:11.215
I'm done with my country.

138
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.319
Fix your own fucking mess.

139
00:09:44.582 --> 00:09:46.017
Uncle Vail!

140
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:47.719
Careful, Sylvie!

141
00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:50.521
This is called a trowel.

142
00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:53.891
This is a bricklayer's
most important tool.

143
00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:55.460
She's a natural.

144
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:02.000
Wait, wait,
let's take a photo.

145
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.201
Alright.

146
00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:10.401
What?

147
00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:44.989
Who do you work for?

148
00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:47.625
Radek sends his regards!

149
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.847
Surprised you changed your mind.

150
00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.784
Cut yourself shaving?

151
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:22.987
Had a visit from some
old friends.

152
00:15:23.821 --> 00:15:25.357
Oh, you brought your tools.

153
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.758
Can you at least pretend
to take this seriously?

154
00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:29.593
I never do a job without
my tools.

155
00:15:29.694 --> 00:15:31.430
That makes zero sense.

156
00:15:31.729 --> 00:15:34.799
We're going on a manhunt,
not building a chimney.

157
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.601
If you understood
everything I said

158
00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:39.104
you'd be me.

159
00:15:41.306 --> 00:15:42.540
Miles Davis.

160
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.245
Greatest jazz musician
of all time.

161
00:15:48.012 --> 00:15:49.214
I don't listen to music.

162
00:15:49.947 --> 00:15:50.982
You're joking.

163
00:15:51.582 --> 00:15:53.218
It's a big assignment for you.

164
00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:54.785
First time in the field.

165
00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:56.887
No supervisors.

166
00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.258
I'm the supervisor.

167
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.029
Listen.

168
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.733
I'm here to find Radek.
I'll give you reports every day.

169
00:16:08.766 --> 00:16:10.501
Just give me space
to do my thing.

170
00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:13.171
Everything goes right,
you just might end promoted.

171
00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:14.373
It's really funny.

172
00:16:14.538 --> 00:16:17.842
I'll likely get blacklisted
working with you.

173
00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:19.311
Why are you here?

174
00:16:19.344 --> 00:16:21.146
Because I believe in
what we're doing.

175
00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:22.347
Of course you do.

176
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.349
Everybody wants to be a spy.

177
00:16:24.582 --> 00:16:26.251
Until they realize the cost.

178
00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:27.452
Lost years.

179
00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:31.156
No time for friends, family,
relationships

180
00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:32.790
pets.

181
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.192
Not an issue for me.

182
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.130
All right.

183
00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.866
Let's go over the operations
briefing on our way over.

184
00:16:41.932 --> 00:16:43.768
Looks like we're
landing at 04...

185
00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:50.668
Time to wake up.

186
00:18:13.724 --> 00:18:15.726
Still Miles Davis.

187
00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:18.829
We're landing.

188
00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:34.645
You drive.

189
00:18:49.727 --> 00:18:51.096
Take the next exit.

190
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.665
The GPS says to stay
on this road.

191
00:18:54.698 --> 00:18:56.867
Yeah, well I gotta take a

192
00:18:57.235 --> 00:18:58.869
a gentlemen's break.

193
00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:07.546
Pull inside.

194
00:19:07.678 --> 00:19:09.680
-What?
-Before they shoot us.

195
00:19:11.082 --> 00:19:13.151
Where the fuck are
you taking us?

196
00:19:21.892 --> 00:19:24.162
How do you like my pop-up?

197
00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:32.937
Good to see you kid!

198
00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.872
You too, old man.

199
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.874
What is going on here?

200
00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:38.476
You're looking good.

201
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.478
Yeah, lots of hot yoga.

202
00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.483
Lovely to
meet you, Kate.

203
00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.818
Vail has told me nothing
about you.

204
00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:50.488
He's told me nothing
about you either.

205
00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.157
Patricio is my outfitter.

206
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.692
He's with the agency?

207
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:55.726
He's family. We served together.

208
00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:57.195
So you're American?

209
00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.164
Only when I need to be.

210
00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:02.967
Oh, bless you, sweet man.

211
00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:07.606
What is that? Drugs?
You brought drugs on
the CIA transport?

212
00:20:07.672 --> 00:20:09.974
No, you don't understand.

213
00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:12.177
You can't get this
shit in Europe.

214
00:20:13.744 --> 00:20:15.380
New kind of cancer treatment.

215
00:20:16.147 --> 00:20:18.450
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

216
00:20:21.686 --> 00:20:22.654
Here we go.

217
00:20:22.753 --> 00:20:24.021
Come on, baby.

218
00:20:24.922 --> 00:20:27.058
Hey, baby, there you are.

219
00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.660
How you doing, girl?

220
00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:31.795
She loves to hide
under the office.

221
00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:33.265
Must be the rats.

222
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:34.099
Here you go.

223
00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:37.469
The dog. The drugs
are for the dog.

224
00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:38.403
Vail?

225
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.174
This wasn't authorized.

226
00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:46.077
-This entire op, isn't
authorized.
-You know what I mean.

227
00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:48.146
You can't just switch it
up on me like this.

228
00:20:48.179 --> 00:20:50.248
Wanna fly under the radar,
this is how you fly.

229
00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:53.652
-You can't make that decision
on your own.
-You wanna find Radek?

230
00:20:53.718 --> 00:20:55.353
We need to do it the right way.

231
00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:56.655
You mean your way.

232
00:20:56.721 --> 00:20:59.190
You called me. This
is how I work.

233
00:20:59.857 --> 00:21:02.360
Can you reset us? Top to bottom?

234
00:21:02.727 --> 00:21:03.961
Let's go.

235
00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:05.463
What is this?

236
00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.965
You got a new look.

237
00:21:09.967 --> 00:21:11.969
Am I to sell Louis Vuittons?

238
00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:15.774
This is way too high-end
for middle-class tourists.

239
00:21:15.806 --> 00:21:17.309
We're losing those covers.

240
00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:20.445
My name's Torrance.
I'm a shipping magnate.
You're my wife.

241
00:21:20.478 --> 00:21:22.147
So now we're married?

242
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.616
That's the only way to sell it.
You're too old to
be my girlfriend.

243
00:21:24.649 --> 00:21:28.819
Cell phones, passports,
credit cards, driver's licenses.

244
00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:31.822
I even put an iTunes gift
card in there for you.

245
00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:33.824
She doesn't like music.

246
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.796
Very romantic. Thank you.

247
00:21:37.828 --> 00:21:40.465
Glock 45 full size.

248
00:21:40.498 --> 00:21:41.800
Serial numbers wiped.

249
00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:42.866
19 round mags.

250
00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:44.935
I'll take two, please.

251
00:21:45.403 --> 00:21:48.506
How about you?
Or is this not authorized
either?

252
00:21:49.973 --> 00:21:51.842
This one won't bite too hard.

253
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.017
I'll take this one.

254
00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:14.299
Here.

255
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.370
Oh, a little less cologne
next time.

256
00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:20.638
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:23.074
And for the final touch.

258
00:22:23.874 --> 00:22:25.243
Hey, Rabbit.

259
00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.179
Bring in the rosebud.

260
00:22:30.648 --> 00:22:34.885
Mercedes CLS AMG V8
biturbo engine.

261
00:22:35.286 --> 00:22:40.091
I bored it out to
seven point two
liters, adding 550 horsepower.

262
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:43.061
Beefed up brakes and
suspension...

263
00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:45.730
reinforced the front
and rear fascia.

264
00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.932
Added auxiliary fuel tank
and radar detector.

265
00:22:49.667 --> 00:22:51.269
There's no airbags.

266
00:22:51.469 --> 00:22:52.604
So drive safe.

267
00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.339
No promises.

268
00:22:56.474 --> 00:22:57.742
Thank you, Patricio.

269
00:22:57.975 --> 00:22:59.511
Have a great trip.

270
00:22:59.977 --> 00:23:02.147
You know how to reach
me if you need me.

271
00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:22.300
What you don't like dogs either?

272
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.572
Don't wipe your hands
on the car.

273
00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:13.952
Who's paying for all this?

274
00:24:15.986 --> 00:24:18.089
Your favorite uncle, Sam.

275
00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.192
I'm not going to even ask.

276
00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:22.827
That's probably best.

277
00:24:23.561 --> 00:24:26.464
Why don't you go clean
up and we'll regroup?

278
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.166
Clean up?

279
00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.635
Yeah, we've been traveling
for 15 hours.

280
00:24:30.668 --> 00:24:33.404
And we need to look our
best for where we're heading.

281
00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.707
Thought you might want
to take a shower.

282
00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.276
I was being considerate.

283
00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:41.679
Thanks.

284
00:24:44.782 --> 00:24:46.618
I guess I could use a shower.

285
00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:50.989
I'll order some food.

286
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:52.390
Make it quick.

287
00:25:04.702 --> 00:25:06.804
Yes, you got fries.

288
00:25:11.876 --> 00:25:13.044
Vail?

289
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.549
Vail?

290
00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:30.221
This came today, and
its a good package.

291
00:26:38.529 --> 00:26:42.900
For your collection.
It's my favorite.
I listen to it all the time.

292
00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:46.738
I brought you something, too.

293
00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:52.044
Grizzly Pines, Montana.

294
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.612
Possible resettlement location.

295
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:56.414
Is it oceanfront?

296
00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:57.715
Adjacent.

297
00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.209
Sorry to interrupt.

298
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.547
There is a Hellenistic
Revival piece
over here you absolutely
must see.

299
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:06.517
The world thinks
the CIA is killing journalists.

300
00:28:06.584 --> 00:28:09.687
You're out hobnobbing.
Damn irresponsible,
don't you think?

301
00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:11.789
Its called networking.

302
00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.859
What are you doing here?

303
00:28:14.892 --> 00:28:16.294
I miss Greece.

304
00:28:16.627 --> 00:28:18.896
You don't look happy
to see me, Tye.

305
00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:21.066
The police are still
looking for you.

306
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.502
Oh I don't think I'm
in any danger
of being outed in this crowd.

307
00:28:24.635 --> 00:28:26.171
Unless you want to turn me in.

308
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:29.440
You know, Kostas
already suspects
the US is running among here.

309
00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:32.044
One call to him, they'd
name an island after me.

310
00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:34.946
Wow. Foreign minister
on speed dial.

311
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.716
You've certainly moved up
in the world since
I last saw you.

312
00:28:38.816 --> 00:28:42.820
I'm sure the agency
would be interested
to know you're back in town.

313
00:28:43.387 --> 00:28:46.290
Well, I got a bigger
trophy for them.

314
00:28:47.658 --> 00:28:48.960
Victor Radek.

315
00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.762
Radek is dead.

316
00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:55.833
Not anymore. The agency
believes he's
the one behind its current
PR problem.

317
00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.169
O'Malley sent you.

318
00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.803
Mhm.

319
00:28:58.836 --> 00:29:01.339
-Why aren't they sharing
their intel?
-They think there's a mole.

320
00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:05.343
Radek's supposedly
in possession of some
doomsday intel.

321
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.080
You know what it is?

322
00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:10.182
Well, you seem to know
a lot more than I do.

323
00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:14.052
Which is pretty frustrating,
considering I'm head
of fucking station.

324
00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:17.989
I heard. Congrats.

325
00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:24.163
Look, I'm here because
need your help.

326
00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:27.065
Radek and I used to throw
cash to an off-shoot gang

327
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:28.800
when we needed dirty work done.

328
00:29:28.966 --> 00:29:30.868
We dealt with a guy called Sten.

329
00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:32.603
You've been gone too long.

330
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.906
Sten is now Denis Stefanopoulos.

331
00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:35.773
He got clean?

332
00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:40.478
No, he got smart.
He runs the Boheme Club
out on the beach.

333
00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:44.382
That's quite the jump
for him, too.

334
00:29:44.982 --> 00:29:48.287
Seems I should have
stuck around.
I might be president.

335
00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:49.954
So long Tye.

336
00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:52.490
Wait.

337
00:29:54.725 --> 00:29:58.197
If Kostas finds out you're here,
he'll make an example of you.

338
00:29:58.462 --> 00:30:02.767
He's running his own
investigation,
just wait until I get
his next brief.

339
00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.636
We can crack this together.

340
00:30:06.904 --> 00:30:09.640
You don't get to ask
me to wait anymore.

341
00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.110
I did it once.

342
00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:56.888
Torrance.

343
00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:00.259
Look at you, Sten.

344
00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:03.628
Hey, got yourself one of these.

345
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:06.064
It's Mr. Stefanopoulos now.

346
00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:10.068
And yes, I've been
very fortunate.

347
00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:12.770
Some gambles have paid off.

348
00:31:12.803 --> 00:31:14.972
A lot has changed since
you disappeared.

349
00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:16.308
Oh, I didn't disappear.

350
00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.709
I just had other appointments
to keep.

351
00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:19.911
Where'd you go?

352
00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:21.712
Didn't you hear I got married?

353
00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:24.182
Spent the last six months
on honeymoon.

354
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:26.184
First Malaysia, then
the Galapagos.

355
00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:28.986
Even did a few weeks in
Jawbone, Kentucky.

356
00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:36.661
Well, congratulations
are in order then.

357
00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:40.665
Come on. Come on in. Come on,
sit down, have a drink.

358
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.471
I'm looking for Radek.

359
00:31:50.042 --> 00:31:52.677
Radek's dead. You know that.

360
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.013
Sure. You know what
they say about Balkan men.

361
00:31:56.181 --> 00:31:59.051
They never really die,
they just smell that way.

362
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.091
Business looks good. Too good
for you to be doing
this all alone.

363
00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:09.493
There's gotta be a partner
somewhere behind those
velour ropes.

364
00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:11.963
Just want to talk to
him, that's all.

365
00:32:12.663 --> 00:32:14.932
I told you what you
already know.

366
00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:16.901
He's dead.

367
00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.602
Stick with that, then.

368
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:22.374
I'm not some small-time punk you
can just push around anymore.

369
00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:25.543
I'm a respected businessman.

370
00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:27.478
My word means something.

371
00:32:27.511 --> 00:32:29.114
Yeah, you look the part.

372
00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:32.583
Except your suit jacket's
about two sizes too big.

373
00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:35.886
And I still see prison ink
on half your boys here.

374
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:38.622
Here's a tip, guys.

375
00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:43.228
You don't leave the top
four buttons open
you might as well not
wear the shirt.

376
00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:47.165
Judging by the cigar
smoke, you still
don't know a Cohiba
from a Don Tomas.

377
00:32:47.232 --> 00:32:48.899
You know what all that tells me?

378
00:32:50.534 --> 00:32:52.803
You're nothing more than
an up-jumped thug

379
00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:54.805
playing dress-up.

380
00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:56.774
While daddy's at work.

381
00:32:56.907 --> 00:32:59.510
You should have stayed
where you were.

382
00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:01.712
Cause now that you're back

383
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.283
it's gonna be hard for
you to leave again.

384
00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:18.029
You might as well have
that drink now.

385
00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:22.566
Since I have no choice.

386
00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:44.882
Shit.

387
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:57.262
You're dead!

388
00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:59.131
You're fucking dead!

389
00:34:59.231 --> 00:35:00.132
Get him!

390
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.342
Get in!

391
00:35:19.717 --> 00:35:21.086
What the hell, Vail?

392
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.120
This is a rental!

393
00:35:22.154 --> 00:35:24.422
You couldn't have splurged
for a mid-size?

394
00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:25.624
Who was that back there?

395
00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:26.690
Some local thugs.

396
00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:29.161
You are the worst spy ever.

397
00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:32.497
There are protocols. You can't
just leave me in the dust.

398
00:35:32.531 --> 00:35:34.566
Trust me, it's for your
own protection.

399
00:35:34.633 --> 00:35:36.468
Oh, please. You're lucky
that I was there.

400
00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.836
We need to swing by the hotel
for my tools give me your phone.

401
00:35:38.869 --> 00:35:41.239
-Why?
-That's how you're tracking
me, right?

402
00:35:41.273 --> 00:35:42.873
-No.
-I found your bug.

403
00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.510
In my shirt collar. Alright,
give it to me

404
00:35:45.709 --> 00:35:48.280
I put it on someone who
could lead us to Radek.

405
00:35:50.282 --> 00:35:51.283
Nice.

406
00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:53.385
Hey.

407
00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:55.487
Look, if I'm gonna help you...

408
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.522
you're gonna need
to help me too.

409
00:35:57.821 --> 00:35:59.157
Fill in the blanks.

410
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.326
The file says that
Radek went rogue.

411
00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.826
What happened?

412
00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.197
Radek was a go-between
with the Greek and
Russian mafias.

413
00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.299
But in reality, he was...

414
00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:09.767
he was performing assignments.

415
00:36:10.435 --> 00:36:11.336
For us.

416
00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.505
Assignments? Like...

417
00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.473
like that hit on Boris Popov?

418
00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:17.275
The guy from the picture?

419
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:20.145
That's right. He joined
the CIA to
get asylum for his
wife and daughter

420
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:23.415
but his cover got blown and
the Russians killed his family.

421
00:36:23.914 --> 00:36:25.283
I saw the photos.

422
00:36:25.317 --> 00:36:26.685
Radek became unhinged.

423
00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.386
He went on revenge tour...

424
00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.289
slaughtering Russians
all over Greece,
anyone he thought was involved.

425
00:36:31.323 --> 00:36:33.924
So that's when the CIA ordered
you to take him out?

426
00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:36.760
I was asked to track
him down and neutralize him.

427
00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:38.296
I thought I did.

428
00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:41.999
Anything else?

429
00:36:42.933 --> 00:36:43.635
No.

430
00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:49.507
Actually, yes. How the fuck
did you know that I was
allergic to dogs?

431
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:51.976
Single woman, your age, no pets.

432
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.145
How did you know I was single?

433
00:36:54.346 --> 00:36:55.779
Lucky guess.

434
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:13.598
Oh my...

435
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.335
Torture, genocide.

436
00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:19.537
Civilians murdered.

437
00:37:19.803 --> 00:37:22.674
Governments toppled through
violent insurrection.

438
00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:25.443
Crimes committed not
by your enemies,

439
00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:27.778
but by the US itself.

440
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:34.219
For decades the world has turned
a blind eye out of
fear and profit.

441
00:37:34.653 --> 00:37:38.757
but what happens when
your allies learn
that you've been doing
the same to them?

442
00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:44.828
To prevent this I
demand payment of
one hundred million US
dollars in Bitcoin.

443
00:37:44.995 --> 00:37:46.964
Hard wallet delivery.

444
00:37:47.931 --> 00:37:50.235
Stand by for instructions.

445
00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:58.043
He's going.

446
00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:01.011
And there's our bug.

447
00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:06.685
You're sure this guy
is working with Radek?

448
00:38:07.185 --> 00:38:09.254
He can't be doing
this all alone.

449
00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:20.298
Shouldn't we be following him?

450
00:38:20.565 --> 00:38:23.668
Radek would never be dumb enough
to meet Sten in public.

451
00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:27.105
But Sten wouldn't be dumb
enough to leave behind evidence.

452
00:38:27.172 --> 00:38:31.476
Okay. Let's toss this place up
and see what we can work with.

453
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.248
I'll take the office.

454
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.963
Anything?

455
00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:59.371
I've got photos and a map
of Emporiou Square downtown.

456
00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:25.063
How's the workmanship?

457
00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:29.067
It's sloppy. But recent.

458
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.766
This is Greta Becker's phone.

459
00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.636
The journalist that was murdered
in Thessaloniki.

460
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.205
Alekos Melas.

461
00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:10.208
"Why the US should
just go home."

462
00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:15.213
The next target.

463
00:40:18.216 --> 00:40:19.150
Come on!

464
00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:49.107
Hey, asshole.

465
00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:50.675
On the ground.

466
00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:51.709
Now.

467
00:41:57.715 --> 00:41:59.083
We just talk.

468
00:42:42.427 --> 00:42:43.361
Ha!

469
00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:08.720
Fuck!

470
00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:43.755
Kate?

471
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:47.592
Kate? You okay?

472
00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.402
Did you take your medicine?

473
00:44:06.411 --> 00:44:10.348
Three hundred hours
of field training.

474
00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.284
It's never happened
to me before.

475
00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:14.752
What, the sneeze?

476
00:44:15.087 --> 00:44:19.957
What? No. That wasn't
my fault. He must
have had a dog.

477
00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:22.694
I didn't see one.

478
00:44:24.796 --> 00:44:26.431
I froze.

479
00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:31.269
Vail, you... you could
have been killed.

480
00:44:32.804 --> 00:44:34.472
Wouldn't be the first time.

481
00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.676
Don't beat yourself up about it.

482
00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:39.811
It happens.

483
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.722
Do you ever get desensitized
by it all?

484
00:44:52.457 --> 00:44:53.491
Yes.

485
00:45:06.071 --> 00:45:07.538
It's Patricio.

486
00:45:08.473 --> 00:45:11.210
He found out where
Alekos Melas will be later.

487
00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.744
The next target.

488
00:45:13.212 --> 00:45:14.312
Where?

489
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.681
I'll give you one guess.

490
00:45:45.009 --> 00:45:46.477
Did a quick perimeter check.

491
00:45:46.878 --> 00:45:50.115
Two fat security guards
and a cop asleep in his car.

492
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:51.849
No sign of Radek.

493
00:45:53.518 --> 00:45:55.254
Shouldn't we warn Melas?

494
00:45:55.353 --> 00:45:56.754
He could be in danger.

495
00:45:57.522 --> 00:46:00.658
Kate, no. We don't want
to spook Radek.

496
00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:03.461
Patricio, you got him, yeah?

497
00:46:05.696 --> 00:46:08.966
So close I can smell
his indigestion.

498
00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:11.335
Four espressos already.

499
00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:13.304
Seems a bit nervous.

500
00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:34.193
Twelve Apostle Church
always was your favorite
drop spot.

501
00:46:34.259 --> 00:46:36.327
I love the frescoes.

502
00:46:36.594 --> 00:46:39.198
Even had dinner with
some of the monks

503
00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:41.432
we made Clams Kokkinisto.

504
00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:43.367
That goes against protocol.

505
00:46:43.768 --> 00:46:46.205
Something we were always
very good at.

506
00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:48.240
I meant for the monks.

507
00:46:48.307 --> 00:46:49.208
Oh.

508
00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:51.576
They shouldn't be eating
past midday.

509
00:46:51.943 --> 00:46:53.312
You must be surprised

510
00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.780
seeing as I'm supposed
to be dead and all.

511
00:46:56.414 --> 00:46:58.616
Surprised isn't the
word I'd use.

512
00:46:59.151 --> 00:47:00.052
Angry.

513
00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:01.786
More like confused, Victor.

514
00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:05.590
We had a deal. I let
you go, you disappear.

515
00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:06.958
Forever.

516
00:47:25.244 --> 00:47:27.445
Vail, I'm blind.
What do you see?

517
00:47:31.983 --> 00:47:32.950
Vail?

518
00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:35.486
Vail!

519
00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:40.458
I did go away.

520
00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:43.661
But I couldn't help but feel

521
00:47:44.196 --> 00:47:45.630
what's the word you used?

522
00:47:46.397 --> 00:47:50.235
Confused. You see,
we never did find out

523
00:47:50.269 --> 00:47:52.204
who blew my cover.

524
00:47:52.337 --> 00:47:54.039
And I hate mysteries.

525
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.176
It's an itch I've needed
to scratch.

526
00:47:58.377 --> 00:48:01.812
They say old wounds
are best left unscratched.

527
00:48:02.747 --> 00:48:04.882
These don't feel old to me.

528
00:48:08.019 --> 00:48:09.420
Patricio!

529
00:48:15.193 --> 00:48:17.262
You know how efficient I can be.

530
00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:21.632
It didn't take long before
all fingers pointed
in one direction.

531
00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:22.700
Putin?

532
00:48:22.767 --> 00:48:24.136
The agency.

533
00:48:25.436 --> 00:48:27.272
That's not possible.

534
00:48:27.406 --> 00:48:29.006
I would have known about it.

535
00:48:29.041 --> 00:48:30.608
Maybe you did.

536
00:48:30.675 --> 00:48:33.711
Maybe that's why I
sent some friends
to come and see you
in Philadelphia.

537
00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:36.013
Why would the agency
blow your cover?

538
00:48:36.248 --> 00:48:37.481
You know why.

539
00:48:37.715 --> 00:48:41.018
One little assignment
left incomplete.

540
00:48:41.053 --> 00:48:42.887
Even if that's true, Victor

541
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:44.822
what you're doing isn't right.

542
00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:48.526
Blackmail. Killing journalists.

543
00:48:49.227 --> 00:48:51.829
It's not just extreme,
it's fucking crazy, Victor.

544
00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.698
I'm only going to warn you once.

545
00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:59.037
Stay out of the way. If not for
yourself, then do it for her.

546
00:48:59.237 --> 00:49:00.172
Who her?

547
00:49:01.239 --> 00:49:02.374
Your partner.

548
00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:05.310
You weren't able to
protect my family.

549
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:08.713
You really think you'll be
able to protect her?

550
00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:22.553
Anything?

551
00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:26.023
It's a tablet.

552
00:50:26.158 --> 00:50:27.725
The screen is cracked.

553
00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:31.962
We should still be able to
access the hard drive.

554
00:50:42.174 --> 00:50:43.175
What?

555
00:50:43.208 --> 00:50:44.209
I warned you.

556
00:50:44.575 --> 00:50:46.944
This rope-a-dope
cowboy shit got Melas killed.

557
00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:48.579
This is why we have protocols.

558
00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:50.781
This is why you got
fired once already.

559
00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:52.284
I didn't get fired, I quit.

560
00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:54.219
A man is dead, Vale.

561
00:50:54.652 --> 00:50:56.088
A civilian!

562
00:50:56.555 --> 00:50:58.856
The agency is going to
get heat for this.

563
00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:01.093
Okay, so which one
are we sad about?

564
00:51:01.393 --> 00:51:03.228
The civilian or the agency?

565
00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:05.896
Tell me.

566
00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:10.368
The photo that Radek left
at the scene of the crime.

567
00:51:10.402 --> 00:51:11.635
Who was it?

568
00:51:12.537 --> 00:51:16.308
Luis Del Gato.
Cuban ambassador to the UN.

569
00:51:16.674 --> 00:51:18.176
Del Gato? But he's...

570
00:51:18.243 --> 00:51:22.114
Alive. Which means Radek
doesn't just have a list
of past CIA hits

571
00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:26.218
-he has a list of active
targets as well.
-We need to call this
into O'Malley.

572
00:51:26.251 --> 00:51:29.019
Kate, don't you get it?

573
00:51:30.388 --> 00:51:31.856
O'Malley already knows.

574
00:51:32.224 --> 00:51:34.226
Then why is it just us here?

575
00:51:34.392 --> 00:51:35.659
If this list gets out

576
00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.196
it's going to unite the
entire world against us.

577
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.698
Now you're starting to
ask the right questions.

578
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.534
I can think of two reasons.

579
00:51:42.601 --> 00:51:45.070
One: O'Malley is covering
his own ass.

580
00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.671
He was station chief
when I was here.

581
00:51:47.705 --> 00:51:49.341
Radek happened under his watch.

582
00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:50.841
Okay, and two?

583
00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:52.110
Think about it, Kate.

584
00:51:52.144 --> 00:51:55.147
Somebody has to be leaking
the info to Radek.

585
00:51:57.482 --> 00:52:00.252
You think O'Malley is the mole?

586
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.123
I don't trust anybody
at the agency.

587
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:06.857
And you shouldn't either.

588
00:52:07.658 --> 00:52:09.660
But you trust Tye Delson.

589
00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:11.429
You read her in, didn't you?

590
00:52:11.496 --> 00:52:12.897
At the art gallery.

591
00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:15.433
Don't look so surprised.

592
00:52:15.467 --> 00:52:16.934
You knew that I was
tracking you.

593
00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:19.237
You didn't think
I would check the guest list.

594
00:52:19.271 --> 00:52:21.473
See, you do have
the necessary trust issues.

595
00:52:21.506 --> 00:52:24.242
So why won't you direct
them toward the right people?

596
00:52:24.276 --> 00:52:29.581
Because I'm trying to make two
and two equal four
with you, Vail.

597
00:52:30.014 --> 00:52:32.317
You keep saying that
we can't trust the agency...

598
00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:34.852
and then you go and read
in the head of station.

599
00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.354
None of this makes sense.

600
00:52:36.421 --> 00:52:37.888
Tye is...

601
00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:42.194
She's an old friend.

602
00:52:43.295 --> 00:52:45.063
You're a hypocrite.

603
00:52:47.065 --> 00:52:48.066
Don't answer it.

604
00:52:48.766 --> 00:52:50.135
Fuck you.

605
00:52:50.302 --> 00:52:51.169
Yes, sir.

606
00:52:51.436 --> 00:52:53.704
Kate. Don't tell them.

607
00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.973
You really are paranoid,
aren't you?

608
00:52:57.342 --> 00:52:59.411
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

609
00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:04.882
If the CIA is responsible
for these murders

610
00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:07.485
the whole United States
will be held accountable.

611
00:53:07.519 --> 00:53:11.356
Mr. Melas paid the
ultimate price,
but his death

612
00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:13.525
his sacrifice

613
00:53:13.558 --> 00:53:16.026
won't be in vain. Thank you.

614
00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:29.140
Christ, Vail.

615
00:53:29.541 --> 00:53:31.142
I'm here for my records.

616
00:53:49.494 --> 00:53:51.429
To my paid vacation.

617
00:53:53.764 --> 00:53:55.300
Kostas suspended all US

618
00:53:55.533 --> 00:53:59.903
intelligence activity in Greece.
He's holding a big press
conference Friday

619
00:53:59.937 --> 00:54:02.340
to announce the findings
of his investigation.

620
00:54:02.374 --> 00:54:03.541
Does he have anything?

621
00:54:03.575 --> 00:54:04.942
O'Malley doesn't think so.

622
00:54:05.243 --> 00:54:08.812
But after the hit today
at the market,
it doesn't look good for us.

623
00:54:09.648 --> 00:54:11.082
Did you see what happened?

624
00:54:11.815 --> 00:54:13.017
Front and center.

625
00:54:13.451 --> 00:54:14.452
You were there?

626
00:54:15.754 --> 00:54:17.855
I saw Radek. Spoke to him.

627
00:54:18.256 --> 00:54:19.291
And?

628
00:54:22.793 --> 00:54:24.862
Did you know that the agency

629
00:54:25.196 --> 00:54:26.464
blew his cover?

630
00:54:28.266 --> 00:54:31.102
I was briefed when I took
over as head of station.

631
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:33.338
They said it was a
necessary evil.

632
00:54:33.405 --> 00:54:36.408
It was a crime, committed by
the CIA against one
of their own.

633
00:54:36.474 --> 00:54:39.009
From what I understand,
the Russians
were responsible
for the killing.

634
00:54:39.044 --> 00:54:42.280
Don't you dare let the agency
wash its hands of this.

635
00:54:42.347 --> 00:54:43.881
Look,

636
00:54:44.115 --> 00:54:47.485
Radek made a deal. And
then one day, he
refused to hold up his
end of the bargain.

637
00:54:47.552 --> 00:54:51.690
You know damn well
what they asked us
to do, and you know why
we couldn't do it.

638
00:54:51.756 --> 00:54:53.591
I'm not defending them, Vale.

639
00:54:53.625 --> 00:54:55.393
I'm just telling it like it is.

640
00:54:55.427 --> 00:54:56.927
The agency felt betrayed.

641
00:54:58.028 --> 00:54:59.863
Well, I know how that feels.

642
00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.336
I waited for you.

643
00:55:05.637 --> 00:55:06.604
I know.

644
00:55:06.638 --> 00:55:07.706
Trains came and went.

645
00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:09.474
I sat on my suitcase
and I waited.

646
00:55:09.507 --> 00:55:11.008
Vail.

647
00:55:11.042 --> 00:55:13.078
I glimpsed faces in the crowd
I kept thinking, they were you.

648
00:55:13.111 --> 00:55:15.113
Oh, here she comes.
There she is.

649
00:55:15.447 --> 00:55:16.914
That must be her.

650
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.049
They never were.

651
00:55:18.083 --> 00:55:18.849
Stop.

652
00:55:19.317 --> 00:55:21.319
You and I were supposed
to get out.

653
00:55:21.386 --> 00:55:23.020
I just... Please.

654
00:55:24.422 --> 00:55:25.623
Why didn't you come?

655
00:55:28.493 --> 00:55:29.960
I... I just

656
00:55:31.429 --> 00:55:32.530
I was scared.

657
00:55:34.432 --> 00:55:37.102
Twenty years I've been
working at this.

658
00:55:37.635 --> 00:55:40.739
This life and all the death
that comes with it.

659
00:55:41.239 --> 00:55:46.344
And it is shitty and
lonely and dreary.

660
00:55:46.444 --> 00:55:47.878
But it's all I know.

661
00:55:49.848 --> 00:55:52.550
When O'Malley called
and offered me the job

662
00:55:53.718 --> 00:55:55.886
it may have been the
wrong choice...

663
00:55:58.189 --> 00:56:00.325
but I have to live with it.

664
00:56:22.347 --> 00:56:24.382
You know, sometimes
the easiest choices

665
00:56:24.449 --> 00:56:27.152
are the ones you don't
have to make by yourself.

666
00:57:13.898 --> 00:57:15.966
When is your meeting
with O'Malley?

667
00:57:17.302 --> 00:57:18.001
Tomorrow.

668
00:57:18.403 --> 00:57:20.538
He's gonna want to know
about the job.

669
00:57:21.506 --> 00:57:22.474
He will.

670
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:24.642
I can't do it.

671
00:57:25.443 --> 00:57:27.946
The gangsters and the
business freaks, that's

672
00:57:27.978 --> 00:57:30.181
that's one thing, but
the politicians?

673
00:57:30.215 --> 00:57:31.649
I didn't even sign up for this.

674
00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:37.155
I hear you, Victor.
But you have an agreement
with the agency.

675
00:57:38.423 --> 00:57:40.225
If you refuse

676
00:57:41.426 --> 00:57:43.094
you're a dead man.

677
00:57:45.597 --> 00:57:48.466
They can rescind
their offer to relocate
your family.

678
00:57:48.967 --> 00:57:50.768
We've been here for six months.

679
00:57:51.169 --> 00:57:54.372
If the agency cared about my
family, they'd be gone already.

680
00:57:59.777 --> 00:58:01.179
This puts me in a tough spot.

681
00:58:01.212 --> 00:58:03.448
Not necessarily. This

682
00:58:04.682 --> 00:58:07.118
This could be the out
you've been looking for.

683
00:58:07.185 --> 00:58:08.786
I can't just walk away.

684
00:58:09.053 --> 00:58:11.256
What if you didn't have
to do this alone?

685
00:58:11.656 --> 00:58:12.857
I mean, think about it.

686
00:58:13.091 --> 00:58:15.460
You, me, the girls.

687
00:58:19.597 --> 00:58:21.199
I'll get them out.

688
00:58:21.666 --> 00:58:23.401
No matter what it takes.

689
00:58:26.671 --> 00:58:28.473
I'll see you in Grizzly Pines.

690
00:58:29.173 --> 00:58:30.608
Grizzly Pines.

691
00:58:50.328 --> 00:58:51.963
Yep, I just received it.

692
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.698
I'll be going through them now.

693
00:58:53.898 --> 00:58:54.832
Okay.

694
00:58:54.866 --> 00:58:55.833
Thank you.

695
00:58:57.468 --> 00:58:58.269
Sleeping in?

696
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:03.841
Yeah. Got the shit
kicked out of me yesterday.

697
00:59:03.875 --> 00:59:05.310
Body needed a reset.

698
00:59:05.877 --> 00:59:07.111
Aren't you on vacation?

699
00:59:07.345 --> 00:59:09.113
I like to think of it
as work from home.

700
00:59:09.147 --> 00:59:12.650
My team was able to trace
the IP address from
the ransom video.

701
00:59:12.684 --> 00:59:13.818
Oh wow.

702
00:59:13.885 --> 00:59:16.154
Sent from an abandoned
rail yard rig outside the city.

703
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.689
-I
-What, what?

704
00:59:17.722 --> 00:59:20.291
Forgot to tell you.
Patricio has Radek's
tablet computer.

705
00:59:20.325 --> 00:59:21.993
-Vale...
-He's going through it.

706
00:59:22.061 --> 00:59:23.695
He'll let us know if
he finds anything

707
00:59:23.728 --> 00:59:26.531
Patricio couldn't find
flies on a horse's ass.

708
00:59:26.698 --> 00:59:27.932
I need that tablet.

709
00:59:27.966 --> 00:59:30.935
Could have critical information
about Radek's next moves.

710
00:59:30.969 --> 00:59:32.170
My career is on the line.

711
00:59:32.236 --> 00:59:33.571
Oh, your career?

712
00:59:33.871 --> 00:59:35.206
Changes everything.

713
00:59:37.508 --> 00:59:38.476
Vail.

714
00:59:40.345 --> 00:59:42.013
Maybe you should just go home.

715
00:59:42.714 --> 00:59:45.084
Look, if Kostas finds
out you're here...

716
00:59:45.116 --> 00:59:46.951
it'll just prove he was right.

717
00:59:47.318 --> 00:59:48.987
There's too much at stake, I...

718
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.556
Let me send some people
down there.

719
00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:53.291
How are you going to do that?

720
00:59:53.324 --> 00:59:55.360
Your station is suspended,
remember?

721
00:59:56.928 --> 00:59:57.895
Look.

722
00:59:58.262 --> 01:00:00.365
This is something I have to do.

723
01:00:01.933 --> 01:00:03.601
Radek was my friend.

724
01:00:04.103 --> 01:00:06.738
I wasn't able to save his family

725
01:00:07.739 --> 01:00:09.374
maybe I can still save him.

726
01:00:11.009 --> 01:00:12.343
Be careful.

727
01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:40.139
Let me guess.

728
01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:43.341
O'Malley wants me
on the first flight out of here.

729
01:00:43.608 --> 01:00:46.611
I didn't tell him what
happened at the market.

730
01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:50.648
Might not be good
for your career.

731
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.752
Look, it's clear to me that
Radek isn't doing this
for the money.

732
01:00:55.453 --> 01:00:57.789
Killing journalists,
the frame jobs.

733
01:00:57.822 --> 01:00:59.557
He wants to punish the CIA.

734
01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:03.861
The money must be
for someone else.
But then, then I started
to think.

735
01:01:06.597 --> 01:01:08.666
If O'Malley's working
with Radek,

736
01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:11.269
why would he send you?

737
01:01:13.172 --> 01:01:14.872
And that's when I realized.

738
01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:19.777
He wouldn't.

739
01:01:21.579 --> 01:01:25.483
So I went through your
bag and I found
a receipt for two burner phones.

740
01:01:35.827 --> 01:01:37.261
One incoming call.

741
01:01:38.097 --> 01:01:39.831
I'm gonna guess that's Radek.

742
01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:43.701
I killed Radek.

743
01:01:45.204 --> 01:01:47.106
Why would I work with him now?

744
01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:50.708
For all I know, you
never killed him.

745
01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:53.711
Maybe you let him go.

746
01:01:58.816 --> 01:01:59.917
Not bad at all.

747
01:02:16.601 --> 01:02:19.303
Come on. We've got to get going.

748
01:02:23.108 --> 01:02:25.043
I am in contact with Radek.

749
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.379
But not for the reasons
you think.

750
01:02:30.615 --> 01:02:32.683
I'll explain all on the way.

751
01:02:38.257 --> 01:02:41.325
Hi, this is Patricio.
Leave a message.

752
01:02:48.566 --> 01:02:50.735
Patricio doesn't miss calls.

753
01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.541
Come on.

754
01:04:14.719 --> 01:04:15.620
Stop!

755
01:04:17.189 --> 01:04:18.357
He's bait.

756
01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:22.026
It's a trap.

757
01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:25.163
You de-rig the platform.

758
01:05:08.506 --> 01:05:11.076
Spread yourselves.
No one gets out.

759
01:05:14.112 --> 01:05:15.613
Come on, come on!

760
01:05:16.447 --> 01:05:17.949
We have to get out of here!

761
01:05:20.218 --> 01:05:21.086
Vail!

762
01:05:21.519 --> 01:05:23.288
We need to get out of here.

763
01:05:23.454 --> 01:05:24.722
They're inside.

764
01:05:34.132 --> 01:05:35.866
Kate, get down.

765
01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.081
Wait!

766
01:05:49.348 --> 01:05:50.514
Get back! Back!

767
01:05:59.091 --> 01:06:00.058
Kate, back up!

768
01:08:20.298 --> 01:08:21.665
Game over, Torrance.

769
01:08:23.301 --> 01:08:24.702
I give you two options.

770
01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:29.074
One, chuck your weapon
and come in for a chat.

771
01:08:30.242 --> 01:08:32.077
Two, drop dead right now.

772
01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:34.146
I'll take number two,

773
01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:35.413
with you any day.

774
01:08:37.582 --> 01:08:39.050
I knew you'd say that.

775
01:08:40.118 --> 01:08:41.052
Come on.

776
01:08:43.488 --> 01:08:46.258
Release the girl, then
I'll walk over.

777
01:08:46.424 --> 01:08:47.292
No, Vail!

778
01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:51.862
You got ten seconds to come out.

779
01:09:07.312 --> 01:09:09.114
She meets me halfway!

780
01:09:13.518 --> 01:09:14.653
The girl can go,

781
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.756
say your goodbyes, and then
you and I can have
a little talk.

782
01:09:19.324 --> 01:09:20.891
I'm sorry, Vail.

783
01:09:20.925 --> 01:09:21.992
Hey,

784
01:09:22.627 --> 01:09:24.329
crying is dying, kid.

785
01:09:24.762 --> 01:09:26.331
We ain't dead yet.

786
01:09:27.566 --> 01:09:29.167
I'm not leaving!

787
01:09:29.234 --> 01:09:30.569
Shut up and listen.

788
01:09:30.635 --> 01:09:32.870
Take the rear door, get
the car and leave.

789
01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:35.739
-No, I'm not leaving you.
-I will meet you at the hotel.

790
01:09:35.773 --> 01:09:37.676
-Don't do this, Vail, please.
-Kate,

791
01:09:37.708 --> 01:09:40.811
go now, or we're both dead.

792
01:10:02.267 --> 01:10:03.368
I tried to tell you.

793
01:10:04.269 --> 01:10:05.303
I'm somebody now.

794
01:10:05.537 --> 01:10:08.973
Yeah. Enjoy it. While it lasts!

795
01:10:43.541 --> 01:10:45.477
I told you to meet
me at the hotel.

796
01:11:03.361 --> 01:11:04.828
I knew Radek was unwell.

797
01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:08.799
I knew the deaths of his family
would be hard on him,

798
01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.702
but I never thought
he'd go this far.

799
01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:13.871
What happened to Radek
and the CIA?

800
01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:16.441
How did it get to this?

801
01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:19.210
Radek was too good at his job.

802
01:11:20.811 --> 01:11:22.614
The agency wanted
to promote him.

803
01:11:23.214 --> 01:11:25.617
No more small-timers,
punks, gangsters.

804
01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:28.286
They wanted him to kill
a political rival.

805
01:11:28.653 --> 01:11:29.587
Who?

806
01:11:30.088 --> 01:11:34.892
Kostas. Neither of us
could go through with it,

807
01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.529
so we agreed to walk away.

808
01:11:37.595 --> 01:11:42.600
We underestimated how vindictive
the agency could be.

809
01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:47.238
I'm sorry.

810
01:11:48.606 --> 01:11:50.275
I'm sorry about Patricio.

811
01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:57.014
My fault. I never
should have gotten him involved.

812
01:11:59.484 --> 01:12:01.252
So what now?

813
01:12:02.853 --> 01:12:04.322
What's our next move?

814
01:12:04.389 --> 01:12:05.290
Radek's gone.

815
01:12:06.524 --> 01:12:07.858
He's beyond saving.

816
01:12:09.127 --> 01:12:10.695
No one is beyond saving.

817
01:12:10.795 --> 01:12:12.364
You saw what he did.

818
01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:18.169
I have to find him and end this,

819
01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:20.638
once and for all.

820
01:12:31.549 --> 01:12:32.784
It's O'Malley.

821
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:35.320
They've agreed to pay
the hundred million.

822
01:12:36.688 --> 01:12:41.292
Good. Radek won't be
able to resist.

823
01:12:55.573 --> 01:13:01.346
US embassies across
Europe have begun
evacuating due to
safety concerns,

824
01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:06.151
with widespread riots predicted
if Minister Kostas Leontaris

825
01:13:06.184 --> 01:13:09.953
is able to prove a link
between the CIA and
these killings.

826
01:13:10.588 --> 01:13:15.293
Tune in here for the
live coverage
of the press conference
later today.

827
01:13:29.808 --> 01:13:30.909
Vail?

828
01:13:31.476 --> 01:13:34.945
Oh, cut the crap. I was born
on a Tuesday, but
not last Tuesday.

829
01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:36.581
I knew you'd run right to her.

830
01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:39.117
You must enjoy this
part of your job.

831
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:40.752
Secret meetings in back rooms?

832
01:13:40.919 --> 01:13:42.153
Anything for my country.

833
01:13:43.121 --> 01:13:48.526
All right, listen up.
Radek has asked
for somebody by name
to make the drop.

834
01:13:48.793 --> 01:13:50.595
Anyone else and it's off.

835
01:13:51.329 --> 01:13:52.564
Our rising star,

836
01:13:53.531 --> 01:13:54.399
Bannon.

837
01:13:54.566 --> 01:13:56.601
What?! You can't go.

838
01:13:56.901 --> 01:13:58.470
We have no choice.

839
01:13:58.536 --> 01:14:01.139
Come on, O'Malley.
You know Radek
only asked for her to get to me.

840
01:14:01.172 --> 01:14:04.042
You're done, Vail.
Thank you for your service.

841
01:14:04.342 --> 01:14:05.443
Excuse me?

842
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:09.347
I think it's safe to
say you've done
enough damage across this city.

843
01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.281
You're out.

844
01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.928
O'Malley,

845
01:14:24.562 --> 01:14:28.500
you might be the dumbest
son of a bitch
to ever cash a government
paycheck

846
01:14:29.067 --> 01:14:30.635
and that's saying something.

847
01:14:46.985 --> 01:14:48.052
Bannon.

848
01:14:50.488 --> 01:14:51.422
You got this?

849
01:14:52.056 --> 01:14:53.525
That's what I'm here for.

850
01:14:53.825 --> 01:14:54.859
He knows our faces.

851
01:14:55.393 --> 01:14:57.195
So, we can't get too
close to you,

852
01:14:57.228 --> 01:14:59.797
but we'll be tracking you
every step of the way.

853
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:00.899
We've got your back.

854
01:15:00.965 --> 01:15:02.467
Remind me how that usually goes?

855
01:15:02.767 --> 01:15:06.237
It helps to remember
we're the good guys Bannon.

856
01:15:08.573 --> 01:15:09.841
I know who I am, sir.

857
01:15:10.008 --> 01:15:12.110
The bitcoin is loaded
onto the flash drive.

858
01:15:12.277 --> 01:15:16.347
Once Radek takes possession,
we'll grab him, bring him in.

859
01:15:45.109 --> 01:15:46.844
Three stops, correct?

860
01:15:47.412 --> 01:15:48.313
Affirmative.

861
01:15:49.847 --> 01:15:51.149
Copy that.

862
01:16:18.643 --> 01:16:19.877
I have the package.

863
01:16:29.687 --> 01:16:30.755
Bingo.

864
01:16:36.961 --> 01:16:38.429
I found the tavern.

865
01:18:46.257 --> 01:18:49.161
This is why nobody does
business with the CIA.

866
01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.096
They cannot follow directions.

867
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:53.631
That was a low blow, Victor.

868
01:18:53.731 --> 01:18:54.832
Asking for Bannon?

869
01:18:55.266 --> 01:18:56.968
I thought it was kind of funny.

870
01:18:57.034 --> 01:18:59.637
No. Killing my friend.

871
01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:02.373
I warned you to not
get involved.

872
01:19:03.075 --> 01:19:06.911
Seems like anyone who gets
close to you ends
up in the dirt.

873
01:19:07.079 --> 01:19:09.047
So why don't you come down,

874
01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:10.548
collect your money?

875
01:19:10.615 --> 01:19:12.583
You and I can get real close.

876
01:19:13.085 --> 01:19:14.585
Even as we speak.

877
01:19:16.121 --> 01:19:17.922
You can't hide from me, Victor.

878
01:19:18.523 --> 01:19:21.160
I'll never, ever stop coming.

879
01:19:21.492 --> 01:19:23.494
I'm not going anywhere.

880
01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:25.463
I'm tired, Vail.

881
01:19:26.231 --> 01:19:27.865
And I want to make peace.

882
01:19:28.699 --> 01:19:31.103
This sure is a fucked
up way of showing it

883
01:19:31.136 --> 01:19:33.004
There's only one
final hit to do.

884
01:19:33.938 --> 01:19:34.939
One assignment.

885
01:19:36.874 --> 01:19:37.775
Kostas?

886
01:19:37.909 --> 01:19:38.810
That's right.

887
01:19:39.077 --> 01:19:40.578
A list is nothing.

888
01:19:40.978 --> 01:19:43.014
They're just words on paper.

889
01:19:43.481 --> 01:19:46.218
But seeing, that is believing.

890
01:19:46.484 --> 01:19:48.753
I'm going to broadcast
to the whole world

891
01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.956
what the CIA has been
doing in the shadows

892
01:19:52.124 --> 01:19:53.024
Victor,

893
01:19:54.358 --> 01:19:55.726
you kill him,

894
01:19:56.494 --> 01:19:58.396
countries will go to war,

895
01:19:59.131 --> 01:20:01.399
millions of lives will be lost.

896
01:20:02.333 --> 01:20:05.336
Sadly, as it must be,

897
01:20:06.737 --> 01:20:09.107
I cannot suffer alone
any longer.

898
01:20:12.343 --> 01:20:13.511
Goodbye, Vail.

899
01:20:14.146 --> 01:20:19.951
Please, please tell
the girls I'll be
seeing them soon.

900
01:21:00.192 --> 01:21:05.029
Kate, Radek is close by.
He got the payoff
he's going to assassinate
Kostas.

901
01:21:05.396 --> 01:21:09.500
Get to the back alley.
This place
is rigged to blow in
about three seconds.

902
01:21:46.837 --> 01:21:47.705
Move over.

903
01:22:43.761 --> 01:22:44.729
Fuck.

904
01:22:57.442 --> 01:22:58.743
We're gonna lose him!

905
01:23:00.479 --> 01:23:01.912
-Brace yourself.
-What?

906
01:23:01.946 --> 01:23:02.880
Brace!

907
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:06.318
Oh shit!

908
01:23:06.351 --> 01:23:07.285
Come on!

909
01:23:34.812 --> 01:23:37.581
Kate, hey, you alright?

910
01:24:11.349 --> 01:24:12.683
Radek!

911
01:24:38.376 --> 01:24:39.777
As many of you know,

912
01:24:40.145 --> 01:24:46.951
my office has been aggressively
investigating the murders
of Greta Becker

913
01:24:47.552 --> 01:24:49.254
and Alekos Melas,

914
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.191
journalists slain on Greek soil.

915
01:25:01.399 --> 01:25:07.872
Many more innocent
civilians gunned
down mere weeks after
publishing articles

916
01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:14.246
condemning the United
States and its
foreign intelligence
activities abroad.

917
01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:23.288
Based on our findings,
I can confidently conclude

918
01:25:25.856 --> 01:25:29.060
the Central Intelligence Agency

919
01:25:50.848 --> 01:25:52.083
It's over, Victor.

920
01:25:53.485 --> 01:25:55.253
Do you hear me? It's over.

921
01:25:56.687 --> 01:25:58.756
Maybe for me,

922
01:26:00.258 --> 01:26:01.759
not for you.

923
01:26:04.862 --> 01:26:07.199
You have to relive
this nightmare

924
01:26:08.166 --> 01:26:09.134
forever.

925
01:26:10.734 --> 01:26:12.870
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect them.

926
01:26:17.708 --> 01:26:18.876
Me too, Vail.

927
01:26:23.682 --> 01:26:26.284
I'll see you in Grizzly Pines.

928
01:27:18.203 --> 01:27:19.237
Tye.

929
01:27:21.839 --> 01:27:26.411
No. It's Kate.

930
01:27:32.584 --> 01:27:34.419
Someone shot me.

931
01:27:34.785 --> 01:27:36.554
That would be the Greeks.

932
01:27:36.588 --> 01:27:40.791
But given all the trouble you've
caused them, I'd call
you guys square.

933
01:27:44.729 --> 01:27:45.996
You okay?

934
01:27:49.167 --> 01:27:51.503
We found Radek's laptop
in the van.

935
01:27:51.869 --> 01:27:53.571
The Bitcoin wallet wasn't there.

936
01:27:54.972 --> 01:27:56.974
Sounds like there's one
last mystery to solve.

937
01:27:57.007 --> 01:28:01.112
We don't care about the money.
That's what it's there
for, to plug holes.

938
01:28:01.613 --> 01:28:04.882
Notice we're watching cartoons
instead of World War III?

939
01:28:05.015 --> 01:28:07.918
That's because Kostas thinks
the CIA saved him.

940
01:28:08.253 --> 01:28:10.854
We took the liberty of
claiming you as our own.

941
01:28:10.988 --> 01:28:12.090
That must have hurt.

942
01:28:12.223 --> 01:28:15.360
We found Radek's
manifesto inside of his van,

943
01:28:15.493 --> 01:28:18.630
claiming he was killing Kostas
on behalf of the CIA.

944
01:28:19.097 --> 01:28:22.467
Plus the entire hit list,
past, present, and future.

945
01:28:22.634 --> 01:28:24.336
So just the truth then, huh?

946
01:28:24.602 --> 01:28:26.104
Truth is subjective.

947
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:29.407
Thankfully, we found
it before anyone else.

948
01:28:29.774 --> 01:28:32.544
Radek is dead. The
list is secure.

949
01:28:33.244 --> 01:28:37.716
But you did interfere
after we told you
to take a hike.

950
01:28:37.782 --> 01:28:39.950
So, all in all,

951
01:28:40.452 --> 01:28:43.488
a job done.

952
01:28:45.457 --> 01:28:47.058
I do have one question.

953
01:28:47.826 --> 01:28:49.227
Why bricklaying?

954
01:28:50.295 --> 01:28:52.297
It's what I know.

955
01:28:53.665 --> 01:28:54.833
Paid for college.

956
01:28:54.865 --> 01:28:56.735
Oh, come on.

957
01:28:56.867 --> 01:29:00.171
You could be making
a killing out there
consulting, but you're
laying brick. Why?

958
01:29:00.405 --> 01:29:03.074
Because when I hold
a brick in my hand,

959
01:29:03.675 --> 01:29:05.543
I know exactly what it is

960
01:29:06.044 --> 01:29:07.312
and what it will do.

961
01:29:07.878 --> 01:29:09.247
Every single time.

962
01:29:10.048 --> 01:29:12.650
Its form is its function.

963
01:29:13.852 --> 01:29:15.120
That gives me peace.

964
01:29:15.687 --> 01:29:20.525
I don't know what
the fuck any of
that means, but it sounds good.

965
01:29:21.059 --> 01:29:22.893
I didn't expect you would.

966
01:29:31.503 --> 01:29:33.138
The money. I mean,

967
01:29:33.171 --> 01:29:36.207
we can't just let him
get away with it.

968
01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:37.941
O'Malley must have it.

969
01:29:37.975 --> 01:29:39.677
He needs to be held accountable.

970
01:29:39.711 --> 01:29:41.979
O'Malley will get what's
coming to him.

971
01:29:43.481 --> 01:29:45.116
Not from us.

972
01:29:45.316 --> 01:29:46.351
So that's it?

973
01:29:46.584 --> 01:29:47.519
We just...

974
01:29:49.387 --> 01:29:50.488
We just let it go?

975
01:29:50.522 --> 01:29:51.489
Kate,

976
01:29:53.525 --> 01:29:54.992
Radek was a complicated man.

977
01:29:55.093 --> 01:29:56.494
But I knew what drove him.

978
01:29:56.528 --> 01:29:58.296
I knew his weaknesses.

979
01:29:58.530 --> 01:29:59.898
Guys like O'Malley,

980
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:01.399
they live for the politics.

981
01:30:01.766 --> 01:30:05.703
They'll sign a death sentence
as casually as signing
a lunch bill.

982
01:30:06.304 --> 01:30:09.006
That's something I'll
never understand.

983
01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:10.508
Kate,

984
01:30:10.742 --> 01:30:12.410
I can't fight an enemy,

985
01:30:13.144 --> 01:30:15.246
I don't understand.

986
01:30:31.763 --> 01:30:34.332
Well, so long, bricklayer.

987
01:30:35.633 --> 01:30:37.435
See you around, kid.

988
01:30:58.823 --> 01:30:59.791
Oh.

989
01:31:00.391 --> 01:31:03.561
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be
at the hospital.

990
01:31:03.595 --> 01:31:04.863
Checked out early.

991
01:31:05.363 --> 01:31:08.031
I was just coming
to see you right before I...

992
01:31:10.134 --> 01:31:12.070
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

993
01:31:12.437 --> 01:31:15.073
I thought I'd get out
of town for a while.

994
01:31:15.773 --> 01:31:17.509
Why don't I get you a drink?

995
01:31:17.976 --> 01:31:21.779
Sure. Still a little
doped up on painkillers.

996
01:31:22.947 --> 01:31:25.283
Should be a good combination.

997
01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:28.453
Where are you going?

998
01:31:29.019 --> 01:31:30.188
Maldives.

999
01:31:31.021 --> 01:31:35.193
Maldives, sounds exotic.

1000
01:31:37.862 --> 01:31:39.197
Never been.

1001
01:31:50.241 --> 01:31:53.211
It's my favorite.
I listen to it all the time.

1002
01:32:26.678 --> 01:32:27.679
Great record.

1003
01:32:28.947 --> 01:32:31.082
Well, it is your collection.

1004
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:33.384
Yeah.

1005
01:32:36.821 --> 01:32:40.525
That's why I'm here, actually.
I'd like to start
boxing them up.

1006
01:32:42.393 --> 01:32:46.464
If you wouldn't mind
lending me a hand.

1007
01:32:50.435 --> 01:32:52.337
Why don't you come with me?

1008
01:32:53.838 --> 01:32:55.406
You want me to go with you?

1009
01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.608
Yeah.

1010
01:32:57.042 --> 01:32:58.676
Get out for good this time.

1011
01:32:58.943 --> 01:33:00.945
Like we always planned.

1012
01:33:04.682 --> 01:33:06.384
That sounds good, Tye, but

1013
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.488
you sent me to die.

1014
01:33:13.191 --> 01:33:15.326
It's kind of a deal
breaker for me.

1015
01:33:34.946 --> 01:33:36.848
I think your uber is here.

1016
01:33:38.816 --> 01:33:40.652
They're not here for me.

1017
01:33:41.686 --> 01:33:43.154
Really?

1018
01:33:44.155 --> 01:33:45.757
So you

1019
01:33:47.558 --> 01:33:48.793
and Radek,

1020
01:33:48.993 --> 01:33:50.328
you gave him the list.

1021
01:33:50.395 --> 01:33:52.997
He came to me. He knew about us.

1022
01:33:53.031 --> 01:33:54.532
I didn't have a choice.

1023
01:33:58.536 --> 01:34:01.539
So the hundred million
was just for shits and giggles.

1024
01:34:01.939 --> 01:34:03.341
You've already donated it to,

1025
01:34:03.374 --> 01:34:05.543
what's that charity you like?

1026
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:07.245
Childhood obesity?

1027
01:34:08.179 --> 01:34:10.214
I should have left with you.

1028
01:34:10.815 --> 01:34:11.749
But I didn't.

1029
01:34:12.784 --> 01:34:14.385
And now...

1030
01:34:15.253 --> 01:34:17.789
I'm not the same person anymore.

1031
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:20.358
Clearly.

1032
01:34:21.559 --> 01:34:23.428
Goodbye, Vail.

1033
01:37:36.721 --> 01:37:38.422
You okay?

1034
01:37:38.789 --> 01:37:40.491
You're welcome.

1035
01:37:58.009 --> 01:38:00.578
I can't believe you thought
I was dirty.

1036
01:38:00.845 --> 01:38:01.779
I may be a prick,

1037
01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:05.350
but I'm a patriot. I believe
in what we're doing here.

1038
01:38:05.616 --> 01:38:07.818
How did you know Delson
was dirty?

1039
01:38:08.019 --> 01:38:09.820
Something Vail said to me.

1040
01:38:10.155 --> 01:38:12.124
About knowing your enemy.

1041
01:38:12.190 --> 01:38:14.059
I knew Tye. She...

1042
01:38:14.393 --> 01:38:15.526
She was me.

1043
01:38:15.593 --> 01:38:18.930
Still the hell of a clean
up we had to do.

1044
01:38:19.630 --> 01:38:21.933
Your persona non grata
in Greece now.

1045
01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:27.638
And I'm sorry to say that you're
no longer welcome
in this division.

1046
01:38:27.672 --> 01:38:30.409
-Sir, I...
-I don't want to hear
anything else.

1047
01:38:30.441 --> 01:38:31.742
Pack your things.

1048
01:38:32.576 --> 01:38:34.212
I'm moving you upstairs.

1049
01:38:35.513 --> 01:38:36.914
You're not dismissing me?

1050
01:38:37.215 --> 01:38:38.449
You're moving up a floor.

1051
01:38:38.482 --> 01:38:40.017
I'm promoting you.

1052
01:38:40.584 --> 01:38:43.121
You think I don't know
what a prick Vail is?

1053
01:38:43.188 --> 01:38:44.655
You did a great job over there.

1054
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:47.125
You're going to be running
your own cases now.

1055
01:38:48.459 --> 01:38:50.761
I'm sorry, but I...

1056
01:38:51.529 --> 01:38:52.730
can't accept.

1057
01:38:53.432 --> 01:38:54.498
You're kidding me.

1058
01:38:54.532 --> 01:38:56.168
I appreciate that, sir, I do.

1059
01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.703
And I do want to serve
my country, just...

1060
01:38:59.503 --> 01:39:00.838
not here.

1061
01:39:01.806 --> 01:39:02.974
Thank you.

1062
01:39:24.129 --> 01:39:25.496
Hey

1063
01:39:26.365 --> 01:39:29.700
Come on. Come on.

1064
01:39:30.668 --> 01:39:32.536
Alright, let's go.

1065
01:39:33.438 --> 01:39:36.475
I thought you said
you were allergic to dogs.

1066
01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:39.478
If you understood everything
I said,

1067
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:40.911
you'd be me.

1068
01:39:42.114 --> 01:39:43.014
Bye.
