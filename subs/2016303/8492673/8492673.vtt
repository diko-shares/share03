1
00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:40.241
I'm alone, just as we agreed.

2
00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:41.374
Of course you are.

3
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.311
You're very ambitious...

4
00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:45.879
and you know this story is gold.

5
00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.052
Did you bring it?

6
00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:53.187
You're no fan of
US intelligence.

7
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.123
You're a little short
on the details.

8
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.857
It's a good thing we met.

9
00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.109
- How did you...
- Does it matter? They're real.

10
00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.180
No, you can't have them.

11
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.849
Yes, you can take photos.

12
00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.166
This type of scandal could
destroy the US.

13
00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:40.967
Yes.

14
00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:44.571
Many will die.

15
00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:58.885
But you called me.

16
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.256
You want this story out there.

17
00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:03.356
I do.

18
00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.326
But unfortunately for you...

19
00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:08.295
I want to be the one
to do the telling.

20
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.868
Is the CIA murdering
journalists?

21
00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:19.806
German journalist Greta Becker
was found dead in a Greek hotel.

22
00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.176
Sparking protests across Europe.

23
00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.311
The third such murder
in a month.

24
00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:29.216
Miss Becker was an outspoken critic
of US intelligence activities abroad.

25
00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.153
Greek Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs...

26
00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:36.290
Kostas Leontaris, pulled no punches
when asked about the incident.

27
00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.627
For decades, the United States
has shown zero regard

28
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.998
for the sovereignty
of other nations.

29
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:49.170
But the days of the CIA treating
Europe like the Wild West are over.

30
00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:10.157
Hey.

31
00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.591
It's nice of you to show up.

32
00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.327
I like to work at night.

33
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.429
Because you have no life?

34
00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.531
Because it's easier to focus.

35
00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:18.966
What have you got for me?

36
00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:20.033
Jack and shit.

37
00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.304
The hotel Greta Becker
was staying at has no CCTV

38
00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:27.007
so I've scanned the streets
around and the train station opposite.

39
00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.074
Nothing.

40
00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:30.978
I did see a nun
traveling with a full drum kit.

41
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:32.712
That was a new one.

42
00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:35.815
Hey, I said I already
checked those.

43
00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.751
I know. But I might see
something you didn't.

44
00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.728
Holy shit.

45
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.303
Sir, I've been trying
to reach you.

46
00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:30.803
Check your email.

47
00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.439
I'm in the middle of breakfast.

48
00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:33.506
This is urgent.

49
00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:44.652
What am I looking at?

50
00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:45.752
Security footage.

51
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.255
Thessaloniki train station,
two days ago.

52
00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:49.822
Our guys already combed this.

53
00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.392
Why are you wasting my time?

54
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.927
Because they missed this.

55
00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:55.162
Victor Radek.

56
00:04:57.398 --> 00:04:58.831
Have you told Thessaloniki?

57
00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.201
I haven't told anyone.

58
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:01.535
What do you know about him?

59
00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.070
Most of his files were redacted.

60
00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:05.539
Civilian born in Greece
but grew up all over.

61
00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:08.008
Died eighteen months ago.

62
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.311
But they never did
find his body.

63
00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:12.313
He was a covert CIA operative

64
00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:15.715
working as an intermediary between
the Russian and Greek Mafias.

65
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.750
Who ran him for us over there?

66
00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.222
Yeah, we're on it.

68
00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:56.322
We're on it.

69
00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.326
Yeah, well, if we had more guys,
it would help.

70
00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:01.528
Yeah, I...

71
00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:03.163
Yeah, hold on a sec.

72
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.699
Can I help you?

73
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.167
Steve Vail.

74
00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:08.268
So?

75
00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:11.005
I'm the bricklayer.

76
00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.242
He'll have the number five with

77
00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:50.911
provolone and some of
that fancy aioli.

78
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:54.515
But hold the peppers.
It aggravates his indigestion.

79
00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:56.683
What do you want?

80
00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:59.386
Can't an old friend stop
by to say hello?

81
00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:01.488
Is that what we are?

82
00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.324
Friends, enemies.

83
00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:05.959
In our business, there's
no distinction.

84
00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:10.331
Someone's trying to
blackmail the CIA.

85
00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:12.966
They're sending messages
with bodies attached.

86
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.736
All journalists who have made
careers going after U.S

87
00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.404
intelligence abroad.

88
00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:20.107
They're trying to make it look
like the CIA is doing the killing.

89
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.444
Whoever's doing the blackmailing
possesses classified information

90
00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:26.013
that could bring down
our entire global network.

91
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.915
We think it's Victor Radek.

92
00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:31.919
Radek's one of the most
dangerous men I've ever known

93
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.520
but he never killed innocents.

94
00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:35.055
I watched him die.

95
00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:37.091
None of this tracks.

96
00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:41.428
Recognize this pretty face?

97
00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:43.296
Boris Popov.

98
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.132
Russian smuggler, bad breath.

99
00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:48.068
Two years ago, Popov died
in a boating accident

100
00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.704
outside of the port
of Thessaloniki.

101
00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:51.905
Accident.

102
00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:52.840
Right.

103
00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:54.174
Popov was a hit

104
00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:55.976
performed by Radek

105
00:07:56.477 --> 00:07:57.611
commissioned by the CIA.

106
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:04.518
This photo of Popov was found at
the scene of Greta Becker's murder.

107
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.653
You know what this
means, don't you?

108
00:08:06.954 --> 00:08:08.389
It means Radek is back...

109
00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.557
And he's got secrets to tell.

110
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:13.060
This is no longer
just a cursory fact-finding.

111
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.728
We need to bring him in.

112
00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:18.132
That's why I want you
to go to Greece with her.

113
00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:19.133
What?

114
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:19.899
Sir-

115
00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:21.034
You're joking.

116
00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:23.570
You know his habits,
contacts, networks.

117
00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:24.938
I can brief someone else.

118
00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:27.074
Someone with more experience.

119
00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:29.009
We don't know who's compromised.

120
00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:32.312
Right now, only the three of us
know that Radek is alive.

121
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.313
It stays that way.

122
00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:35.649
Look I'm persona non grata
with the agency

123
00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:37.584
I can't even enter
Greece legally.

124
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:38.986
This isn't sanctioned, Vail.

125
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.821
We're doing it off the books.

126
00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:44.258
You'll be working around the Greeks
and Interpol as well as our own people.

127
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.560
Sir, I really think that
you should reconsider

128
00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:49.263
sending someone
a little bit more credentialed.

129
00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:50.296
I agree.

130
00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:52.933
She wouldn't last 24
hours on the ground.

131
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.368
I was talking about you.

132
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.401
Enough.

133
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.504
This is your fuck up Vail

134
00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:58.839
and you need to fix it.

135
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.941
Before he starts coming for you.

136
00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:07.281
Unless, of course, you
want to do it for your country.

137
00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:11.084
I'm done with my country.

138
00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.188
Fix your own fucking mess.

139
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:45.886
Uncle Vail!

140
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.588
Careful, Sylvie!

141
00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:50.390
This is called a trowel.

142
00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:53.760
This is a bricklayer's
most important tool.

143
00:09:53.928 --> 00:09:55.329
She's a natural.

144
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.869
Wait, wait, let's take a photo.

145
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.070
Alright.

146
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.270
What?

147
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:44.858
Who do you work for?

148
00:13:45.093 --> 00:13:47.494
Radek sends his regards!

149
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:16.716
Surprised you changed your mind.

150
00:15:18.286 --> 00:15:19.653
Cut yourself shaving?

151
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.856
Had a visit from some
old friends.

152
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.226
Oh, you brought your tools.

153
00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:27.627
Can you at least pretend
to take this seriously?

154
00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:29.462
I never do a job without
my tools.

155
00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:31.299
That makes zero sense.

156
00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:34.668
We're going on a manhunt,
not building a chimney.

157
00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:37.470
If you understood
everything I said

158
00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:39.005
you'd be me.

159
00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:42.409
Miles Davis.

160
00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:47.114
Greatest jazz musician
of all time.

161
00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:49.083
I don't listen to music.

162
00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:50.851
You're joking.

163
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.087
It's a big assignment for you.

164
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.654
First time in the field.

165
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.756
No supervisors.

166
00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:00.127
I'm the supervisor.

167
00:16:03.998 --> 00:16:04.998
Listen.

168
00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:08.602
I'm here to find Radek.
I'll give you reports every day.

169
00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.370
Just give me space
to do my thing.

170
00:16:10.403 --> 00:16:13.040
Everything goes right,
you just might end promoted.

171
00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:14.242
It's really funny.

172
00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:17.711
I'll likely get blacklisted
working with you.

173
00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:19.180
Why are you here?

174
00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:21.015
Because I believe in
what we're doing.

175
00:16:21.115 --> 00:16:22.216
Of course you do.

176
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.218
Everybody wants to be a spy.

177
00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:26.120
Until they realize the cost.

178
00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:27.453
Lost years.

179
00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:31.025
No time for friends, family,
relationships

180
00:16:31.758 --> 00:16:32.758
pets.

181
00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:34.061
Not an issue for me.

182
00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:37.999
All right.

183
00:16:38.933 --> 00:16:41.735
Let's go over the operations
briefing on our way over.

184
00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:43.637
Looks like we're
landing at 04...

185
00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:50.537
Time to wake up.

186
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.595
Still Miles Davis.

187
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:18.698
We're landing.

188
00:18:33.147 --> 00:18:34.514
You drive.

189
00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:50.965
Take the next exit.

190
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.534
The GPS says to stay
on this road.

191
00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:56.736
Yeah, well I gotta take a

192
00:18:57.104 --> 00:18:58.738
a gentlemen's break.

193
00:19:06.347 --> 00:19:07.415
Pull inside.

194
00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:09.549
- What?
- Before they shoot us.

195
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:13.020
Where the fuck are
you taking us?

196
00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:24.031
How do you like my pop-up?

197
00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:32.806
Good to see you kid!

198
00:19:33.174 --> 00:19:34.741
You too, old man.

199
00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:36.743
What is going on here?

200
00:19:37.178 --> 00:19:38.345
You're looking good.

201
00:19:38.379 --> 00:19:40.347
Yeah, lots of hot yoga.

202
00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:45.352
Lovely to meet you, Kate.

203
00:19:45.386 --> 00:19:47.687
Vail has told me nothing
about you.

204
00:19:47.988 --> 00:19:50.357
He's told me nothing
about you either.

205
00:19:50.391 --> 00:19:52.026
Patricio is my outfitter.

206
00:19:52.393 --> 00:19:53.561
He's with the agency?

207
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.595
He's family. We served together.

208
00:19:55.628 --> 00:19:57.064
So you're American?

209
00:19:57.565 --> 00:19:59.033
Only when I need to be.

210
00:20:00.234 --> 00:20:02.836
Oh, bless you, sweet man.

211
00:20:03.603 --> 00:20:07.475
What is that? Drugs? You
brought drugs on the CIA transport?

212
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:09.843
No, you don't understand.

213
00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:12.046
You can't get this
shit in Europe.

214
00:20:13.613 --> 00:20:15.249
New kind of cancer treatment.

215
00:20:16.016 --> 00:20:18.319
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

216
00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:22.555
Here we go.

217
00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:23.890
Come on, baby.

218
00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:26.927
Hey, baby, there you are.

219
00:20:27.228 --> 00:20:28.529
How you doing, girl?

220
00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:31.664
She loves to hide
under the office.

221
00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:33.134
Must be the rats.

222
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.968
Here you go.

223
00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:37.338
The dog. The drugs
are for the dog.

224
00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:38.371
Vail?

225
00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:43.043
This wasn't authorized.

226
00:20:43.077 --> 00:20:45.946
- This entire op, isn't authorized.
- You know what I mean.

227
00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:48.015
You can't just switch it
up on me like this.

228
00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:50.117
Wanna fly under the radar,
this is how you fly.

229
00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:53.521
- You can't make that decision on your own.
- You wanna find Radek?

230
00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:55.222
We need to do it the right way.

231
00:20:55.256 --> 00:20:56.524
You mean your way.

232
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.059
You called me. This
is how I work.

233
00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:02.229
Can you reset us? Top to bottom?

234
00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:03.830
Let's go.

235
00:21:04.298 --> 00:21:05.332
What is this?

236
00:21:06.267 --> 00:21:07.834
You got a new look.

237
00:21:09.836 --> 00:21:11.838
Am I to sell Louis Vuittons?

238
00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:15.643
This is way too high-end
for middle-class tourists.

239
00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:17.178
We're losing those covers.

240
00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:20.314
My name's Torrance. I'm a
shipping magnate. You're my wife.

241
00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:22.016
So now we're married?

242
00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:24.494
That's the only way to sell it.
You're too old to be my girlfriend.

243
00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:28.688
Cell phones, passports,
credit cards, driver's licenses.

244
00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:31.691
I even put an iTunes gift
card in there for you.

245
00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:33.693
She doesn't like music.

246
00:21:35.429 --> 00:21:37.665
Very romantic. Thank you.

247
00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:40.334
Glock 45 full size.

248
00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:41.669
Serial numbers wiped.

249
00:21:41.701 --> 00:21:42.735
19 round mags.

250
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.804
I'll take two, please.

251
00:21:45.272 --> 00:21:48.375
How about you? Or is
this not authorized either?

252
00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:51.711
This one won't bite too hard.

253
00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:59.886
I'll take this one.

254
00:22:13.267 --> 00:22:14.267
Here.

255
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:18.239
Oh, a little less cologne
next time.

256
00:22:19.473 --> 00:22:20.507
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:22:20.773 --> 00:22:22.943
And for the final touch.

258
00:22:23.743 --> 00:22:25.112
Hey, Rabbit.

259
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.048
Bring in the rosebud.

260
00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:34.754
Mercedes CLS AMG V8
biturbo engine.

261
00:22:35.155 --> 00:22:39.960
I bored it out to seven point
two liters, adding 550 horsepower.

262
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.930
Beefed up brakes and
suspension...

263
00:22:42.963 --> 00:22:45.599
reinforced the front
and rear fascia.

264
00:22:45.733 --> 00:22:48.801
Added auxiliary fuel tank
and radar detector.

265
00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:51.138
There's no airbags.

266
00:22:51.338 --> 00:22:52.473
So drive safe.

267
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.208
No promises.

268
00:22:56.343 --> 00:22:57.611
Thank you, Patricio.

269
00:22:57.844 --> 00:22:59.380
Have a great trip.

270
00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:02.016
You know how to reach
me if you need me.

271
00:23:20.434 --> 00:23:22.169
What you don't like dogs either?

272
00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:27.441
Don't wipe your hands
on the car.

273
00:24:12.086 --> 00:24:13.821
Who's paying for all this?

274
00:24:15.855 --> 00:24:17.958
Your favorite uncle, Sam.

275
00:24:19.493 --> 00:24:21.061
I'm not going to even ask.

276
00:24:21.095 --> 00:24:22.696
That's probably best.

277
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.333
Why don't you go clean
up and we'll regroup?

278
00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:28.035
Clean up?

279
00:24:28.736 --> 00:24:30.504
Yeah, we've been traveling
for 15 hours.

280
00:24:30.537 --> 00:24:33.273
And we need to look our
best for where we're heading.

281
00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:35.576
Thought you might want
to take a shower.

282
00:24:36.677 --> 00:24:38.145
I was being considerate.

283
00:24:40.314 --> 00:24:41.548
Thanks.

284
00:24:44.651 --> 00:24:46.487
I guess I could use a shower.

285
00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:50.858
I'll order some food.

286
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.259
Make it quick.

287
00:25:04.571 --> 00:25:06.673
Yes, you got fries.

288
00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:12.913
Vail?

289
00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:17.418
Vail?

290
00:26:26.587 --> 00:26:30.090
This came today, and
its a good package.

291
00:26:38.398 --> 00:26:42.769
For your collection. It's my
favorite. I listen to it all the time.

292
00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:46.607
I brought you something, too.

293
00:26:49.944 --> 00:26:51.913
Grizzly Pines, Montana.

294
00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:54.481
Possible resettlement location.

295
00:26:54.983 --> 00:26:56.283
Is it oceanfront?

296
00:26:56.617 --> 00:26:57.617
Adjacent.

297
00:27:56.877 --> 00:27:58.078
Sorry to interrupt.

298
00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:02.416
There is a Hellenistic Revival piece
over here you absolutely must see.

299
00:28:04.018 --> 00:28:06.386
The world thinks
the CIA is killing journalists.

300
00:28:06.453 --> 00:28:09.556
You're out hobnobbing. Damn
irresponsible, don't you think?

301
00:28:09.623 --> 00:28:11.658
Its called networking.

302
00:28:13.093 --> 00:28:14.728
What are you doing here?

303
00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:16.163
I miss Greece.

304
00:28:16.496 --> 00:28:18.765
You don't look happy
to see me, Tye.

305
00:28:19.033 --> 00:28:20.935
The police are still
looking for you.

306
00:28:20.969 --> 00:28:24.371
Oh I don't think I'm in any
danger of being outed in this crowd.

307
00:28:24.504 --> 00:28:26.040
Unless you want to turn me in.

308
00:28:26.074 --> 00:28:29.309
You know, Kostas already suspects
the US is running among here.

309
00:28:29.343 --> 00:28:31.913
One call to him, they'd
name an island after me.

310
00:28:31.946 --> 00:28:34.815
Wow. Foreign minister
on speed dial.

311
00:28:35.649 --> 00:28:38.585
You've certainly moved up in
the world since I last saw you.

312
00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:42.689
I'm sure the agency would be
interested to know you're back in town.

313
00:28:43.256 --> 00:28:46.159
Well, I got a bigger
trophy for them.

314
00:28:47.527 --> 00:28:48.829
Victor Radek.

315
00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:50.631
Radek is dead.

316
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:55.702
Not anymore. The agency believes
he's the one behind its current PR problem.

317
00:28:55.736 --> 00:28:57.038
O'Malley sent you.

318
00:28:57.071 --> 00:28:58.672
Mhm.

319
00:28:58.705 --> 00:29:01.345
- Why aren't they sharing their intel?
- They think there's a mole.

320
00:29:01.742 --> 00:29:05.212
Radek's supposedly in
possession of some doomsday intel.

321
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.949
You know what it is?

322
00:29:08.082 --> 00:29:10.051
Well, you seem to know
a lot more than I do.

323
00:29:10.118 --> 00:29:13.921
Which is pretty frustrating,
considering I'm head of fucking station.

324
00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:17.858
I heard. Congrats.

325
00:29:21.996 --> 00:29:24.032
Look, I'm here because
need your help.

326
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:26.934
Radek and I used to throw
cash to an off-shoot gang

327
00:29:26.968 --> 00:29:28.669
when we needed dirty work done.

328
00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:30.737
We dealt with a guy called Sten.

329
00:29:30.938 --> 00:29:32.472
You've been gone too long.

330
00:29:32.974 --> 00:29:34.775
Sten is now Denis Stefanopoulos.

331
00:29:34.808 --> 00:29:35.808
He got clean?

332
00:29:36.176 --> 00:29:40.347
No, he got smart. He runs the
Boheme Club out on the beach.

333
00:29:42.182 --> 00:29:44.251
That's quite the jump
for him, too.

334
00:29:44.851 --> 00:29:48.156
Seems I should have stuck
around. I might be president.

335
00:29:48.588 --> 00:29:49.823
So long Tye.

336
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:52.359
Wait.

337
00:29:54.594 --> 00:29:58.066
If Kostas finds out you're here,
he'll make an example of you.

338
00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:02.636
He's running his own investigation,
just wait until I get his next brief.

339
00:30:03.837 --> 00:30:05.505
We can crack this together.

340
00:30:06.773 --> 00:30:09.509
You don't get to ask
me to wait anymore.

341
00:30:10.577 --> 00:30:11.979
I did it once.

342
00:30:55.856 --> 00:30:56.856
Torrance.

343
00:30:58.458 --> 00:31:00.128
Look at you, Sten.

344
00:31:00.194 --> 00:31:03.497
Hey, got yourself one of these.

345
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.933
It's Mr. Stefanopoulos now.

346
00:31:07.267 --> 00:31:09.937
And yes, I've been
very fortunate.

347
00:31:10.537 --> 00:31:12.639
Some gambles have paid off.

348
00:31:12.672 --> 00:31:14.841
A lot has changed since
you disappeared.

349
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:16.177
Oh, I didn't disappear.

350
00:31:16.276 --> 00:31:18.578
I just had other appointments
to keep.

351
00:31:18.812 --> 00:31:19.812
Where'd you go?

352
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:21.581
Didn't you hear I got married?

353
00:31:21.815 --> 00:31:24.051
Spent the last six months
on honeymoon.

354
00:31:24.085 --> 00:31:26.053
First Malaysia, then
the Galapagos.

355
00:31:26.553 --> 00:31:28.855
Even did a few weeks in
Jawbone, Kentucky.

356
00:31:33.627 --> 00:31:36.530
Well, congratulations
are in order then.

357
00:31:36.897 --> 00:31:40.534
Come on. Come on in. Come on,
sit down, have a drink.

358
00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:47.340
I'm looking for Radek.

359
00:31:49.911 --> 00:31:52.546
Radek's dead. You know that.

360
00:31:52.579 --> 00:31:55.882
Sure. You know what
they say about Balkan men.

361
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.920
They never really die,
they just smell that way.

362
00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:05.960
Business looks good. Too good
for you to be doing this all alone.

363
00:32:05.993 --> 00:32:09.362
There's gotta be a partner
somewhere behind those velour ropes.

364
00:32:09.763 --> 00:32:11.832
Just want to talk to
him, that's all.

365
00:32:12.532 --> 00:32:14.801
I told you what you
already know.

366
00:32:15.735 --> 00:32:16.770
He's dead.

367
00:32:17.004 --> 00:32:18.471
Stick with that, then.

368
00:32:18.538 --> 00:32:22.243
I'm not some small-time punk you
can just push around anymore.

369
00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:25.412
I'm a respected businessman.

370
00:32:25.913 --> 00:32:27.347
My word means something.

371
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.983
Yeah, you look the part.

372
00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:32.452
Except your suit jacket's
about two sizes too big.

373
00:32:32.987 --> 00:32:35.755
And I still see prison ink
on half your boys here.

374
00:32:37.325 --> 00:32:38.491
Here's a tip, guys.

375
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.097
You don't leave the top four buttons
open you might as well not wear the shirt.

376
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:47.034
Judging by the cigar smoke, you still
don't know a Cohiba from a Don Tomas.

377
00:32:47.101 --> 00:32:48.768
You know what all that tells me?

378
00:32:50.403 --> 00:32:52.672
You're nothing more than
an up-jumped thug

379
00:32:53.174 --> 00:32:54.674
playing dress-up.

380
00:32:55.176 --> 00:32:56.643
While daddy's at work.

381
00:32:56.776 --> 00:32:59.379
You should have stayed
where you were.

382
00:32:59.646 --> 00:33:01.581
Cause now that you're back

383
00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:05.152
it's gonna be hard for
you to leave again.

384
00:33:15.562 --> 00:33:17.898
You might as well have
that drink now.

385
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.435
Since I have no choice.

386
00:34:43.483 --> 00:34:44.751
Shit.

387
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.131
You're dead!

388
00:34:57.465 --> 00:34:59.000
You're fucking dead!

389
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.100
Get him!

390
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.310
Get in!

391
00:35:19.586 --> 00:35:20.955
What the hell, Vail?

392
00:35:20.988 --> 00:35:21.989
This is a rental!

393
00:35:22.023 --> 00:35:24.291
You couldn't have splurged
for a mid-size?

394
00:35:24.325 --> 00:35:25.493
Who was that back there?

395
00:35:25.525 --> 00:35:26.559
Some local thugs.

396
00:35:26.893 --> 00:35:29.030
You are the worst spy ever.

397
00:35:29.096 --> 00:35:32.366
There are protocols. You can't
just leave me in the dust.

398
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.435
Trust me, it's for your
own protection.

399
00:35:34.502 --> 00:35:36.337
Oh, please. You're lucky
that I was there.

400
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.714
We need to swing by the hotel
for my tools give me your phone.

401
00:35:38.738 --> 00:35:41.108
- Why?
- That's how you're tracking me, right?

402
00:35:41.142 --> 00:35:42.742
- No.
- I found your bug.

403
00:35:42.776 --> 00:35:45.379
In my shirt collar. Alright,
give it to me

404
00:35:45.578 --> 00:35:48.149
I put it on someone who
could lead us to Radek.

405
00:35:50.151 --> 00:35:51.152
Nice.

406
00:35:52.353 --> 00:35:53.254
Hey.

407
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.356
Look, if I'm gonna help you...

408
00:35:55.389 --> 00:35:57.391
you're gonna need
to help me too.

409
00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.026
Fill in the blanks.

410
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.195
The file says that
Radek went rogue.

411
00:36:01.228 --> 00:36:02.695
What happened?

412
00:36:02.729 --> 00:36:05.066
Radek was a go-between with
the Greek and Russian mafias.

413
00:36:05.132 --> 00:36:07.168
But in reality, he was...

414
00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:09.636
he was performing assignments.

415
00:36:10.304 --> 00:36:11.304
For us.

416
00:36:11.505 --> 00:36:13.374
Assignments? Like...

417
00:36:13.573 --> 00:36:15.342
like that hit on Boris Popov?

418
00:36:15.376 --> 00:36:17.144
The guy from the picture?

419
00:36:17.178 --> 00:36:20.014
That's right. He joined the CIA to
get asylum for his wife and daughter

420
00:36:20.047 --> 00:36:23.284
but his cover got blown and
the Russians killed his family.

421
00:36:23.783 --> 00:36:25.152
I saw the photos.

422
00:36:25.186 --> 00:36:26.554
Radek became unhinged.

423
00:36:26.586 --> 00:36:28.255
He went on revenge tour...

424
00:36:28.289 --> 00:36:31.158
slaughtering Russians all over
Greece, anyone he thought was involved.

425
00:36:31.192 --> 00:36:33.793
So that's when the CIA ordered
you to take him out?

426
00:36:33.827 --> 00:36:36.629
I was asked to track
him down and neutralize him.

427
00:36:36.964 --> 00:36:38.165
I thought I did.

428
00:36:40.434 --> 00:36:41.868
Anything else?

429
00:36:42.802 --> 00:36:43.802
No.

430
00:36:44.604 --> 00:36:49.376
Actually, yes. How the fuck did
you know that I was allergic to dogs?

431
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.845
Single woman, your age, no pets.

432
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:54.014
How did you know I was single?

433
00:36:54.215 --> 00:36:55.648
Lucky guess.

434
00:37:12.433 --> 00:37:13.467
Oh my...

435
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:17.204
Torture, genocide.

436
00:37:17.471 --> 00:37:19.406
Civilians murdered.

437
00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:22.543
Governments toppled through
violent insurrection.

438
00:37:22.675 --> 00:37:25.312
Crimes committed not
by your enemies,

439
00:37:25.412 --> 00:37:27.647
but by the US itself.

440
00:37:29.649 --> 00:37:34.088
For decades the world has turned
a blind eye out of fear and profit.

441
00:37:34.522 --> 00:37:38.626
But what happens when your allies learn
that you've been doing the same to them?

442
00:37:38.658 --> 00:37:44.697
To prevent this I demand payment of
one hundred million US dollars in Bitcoin.

443
00:37:44.864 --> 00:37:46.833
Hard wallet delivery.

444
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.104
Stand by for instructions.

445
00:37:57.011 --> 00:37:58.011
He's going.

446
00:37:59.446 --> 00:38:00.880
And there's our bug.

447
00:38:03.918 --> 00:38:06.554
You're sure this guy
is working with Radek?

448
00:38:07.054 --> 00:38:09.123
He can't be doing
this all alone.

449
00:38:18.765 --> 00:38:20.167
Shouldn't we be following him?

450
00:38:20.434 --> 00:38:23.537
Radek would never be dumb enough
to meet Sten in public.

451
00:38:24.071 --> 00:38:26.974
But Sten wouldn't be dumb
enough to leave behind evidence.

452
00:38:27.041 --> 00:38:31.345
Okay. Let's toss this place up
and see what we can work with.

453
00:38:35.649 --> 00:38:37.117
I'll take the office.

454
00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.832
Anything?

455
00:38:55.336 --> 00:38:59.240
I've got photos and a map
of Emporiou Square downtown.

456
00:39:23.697 --> 00:39:24.932
How's the workmanship?

457
00:39:24.965 --> 00:39:28.936
It's sloppy. But recent.

458
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.635
This is Greta Becker's phone.

459
00:40:01.935 --> 00:40:04.505
The journalist that was murdered
in Thessaloniki.

460
00:40:05.439 --> 00:40:07.074
Alekos Melas.

461
00:40:07.574 --> 00:40:10.077
"Why the US should
just go home."

462
00:40:13.681 --> 00:40:15.082
The next target.

463
00:40:18.085 --> 00:40:19.085
Come on!

464
00:41:47.775 --> 00:41:48.976
Hey, asshole.

465
00:41:49.576 --> 00:41:50.576
On the ground.

466
00:41:50.644 --> 00:41:51.644
Now.

467
00:41:57.584 --> 00:41:58.952
We just talk.

468
00:42:42.296 --> 00:42:43.296
Ha!

469
00:43:07.654 --> 00:43:08.654
Fuck!

470
00:43:42.823 --> 00:43:43.823
Kate?

471
00:43:44.491 --> 00:43:47.461
Kate? You okay?

472
00:43:55.702 --> 00:43:57.271
Did you take your medicine?

473
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.217
Three hundred hours
of field training.

474
00:44:11.251 --> 00:44:13.153
It's never happened
to me before.

475
00:44:13.654 --> 00:44:14.654
What, the sneeze?

476
00:44:14.956 --> 00:44:19.826
What? No. That wasn't my
fault. He must have had a dog.

477
00:44:21.128 --> 00:44:22.563
I didn't see one.

478
00:44:24.665 --> 00:44:26.300
I froze.

479
00:44:28.435 --> 00:44:31.138
Vail, you... you could
have been killed.

480
00:44:32.673 --> 00:44:34.341
Wouldn't be the first time.

481
00:44:36.843 --> 00:44:38.545
Don't beat yourself up about it.

482
00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:39.680
It happens.

483
00:44:46.219 --> 00:44:50.591
Do you ever get desensitized
by it all?

484
00:44:52.326 --> 00:44:53.360
Yes.

485
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.407
It's Patricio.

486
00:45:08.342 --> 00:45:11.079
He found out where
Alekos Melas will be later.

487
00:45:11.244 --> 00:45:12.613
The next target.

488
00:45:13.081 --> 00:45:14.181
Where?

489
00:45:14.949 --> 00:45:16.550
I'll give you one guess.

490
00:45:44.878 --> 00:45:46.346
Did a quick perimeter check.

491
00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:49.984
Two fat security guards
and a cop asleep in his car.

492
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.718
No sign of Radek.

493
00:45:53.387 --> 00:45:55.123
Shouldn't we warn Melas?

494
00:45:55.222 --> 00:45:56.623
He could be in danger.

495
00:45:57.391 --> 00:46:00.527
Kate, no. We don't want
to spook Radek.

496
00:46:01.528 --> 00:46:03.330
Patricio, you got him, yeah?

497
00:46:05.565 --> 00:46:08.835
So close I can smell
his indigestion.

498
00:46:09.436 --> 00:46:11.204
Four espressos already.

499
00:46:11.338 --> 00:46:13.173
Seems a bit nervous.

500
00:46:30.824 --> 00:46:34.062
Twelve Apostle Church always
was your favorite drop spot.

501
00:46:34.128 --> 00:46:36.196
I love the frescoes.

502
00:46:36.463 --> 00:46:39.067
Even had dinner with
some of the monks

503
00:46:39.332 --> 00:46:41.301
we made Clams Kokkinisto.

504
00:46:41.535 --> 00:46:43.236
That goes against protocol.

505
00:46:43.637 --> 00:46:46.074
Something we were always
very good at.

506
00:46:46.273 --> 00:46:48.109
I meant for the monks.

507
00:46:48.176 --> 00:46:49.176
Oh.

508
00:46:49.276 --> 00:46:51.445
They shouldn't be eating
past midday.

509
00:46:51.812 --> 00:46:53.181
You must be surprised

510
00:46:53.346 --> 00:46:55.649
seeing as I'm supposed
to be dead and all.

511
00:46:56.283 --> 00:46:58.485
Surprised isn't the
word I'd use.

512
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.020
Angry.

513
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.655
More like confused, Victor.

514
00:47:01.688 --> 00:47:05.459
We had a deal. I let
you go, you disappear.

515
00:47:05.792 --> 00:47:06.827
Forever.

516
00:47:25.113 --> 00:47:27.314
Vail, I'm blind.
What do you see?

517
00:47:31.852 --> 00:47:32.852
Vail?

518
00:47:34.254 --> 00:47:35.355
Vail!

519
00:47:38.892 --> 00:47:40.327
I did go away.

520
00:47:41.628 --> 00:47:43.530
But I couldn't help but feel

521
00:47:44.065 --> 00:47:45.499
what's the word you used?

522
00:47:46.266 --> 00:47:50.104
Confused. You see,
we never did find out

523
00:47:50.138 --> 00:47:52.073
who blew my cover.

524
00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:53.908
And I hate mysteries.

525
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:58.045
It's an itch I've needed
to scratch.

526
00:47:58.246 --> 00:48:01.681
They say old wounds
are best left unscratched.

527
00:48:02.616 --> 00:48:04.751
These don't feel old to me.

528
00:48:07.888 --> 00:48:09.289
Patricio!

529
00:48:15.062 --> 00:48:17.131
You know how efficient I can be.

530
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:21.501
It didn't take long before all
fingers pointed in one direction.

531
00:48:21.535 --> 00:48:22.569
Putin?

532
00:48:22.636 --> 00:48:24.005
The agency.

533
00:48:25.305 --> 00:48:27.141
That's not possible.

534
00:48:27.275 --> 00:48:28.875
I would have known about it.

535
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:30.477
Maybe you did.

536
00:48:30.544 --> 00:48:33.580
Maybe that's why I sent some friends
to come and see you in Philadelphia.

537
00:48:33.713 --> 00:48:35.882
Why would the agency
blow your cover?

538
00:48:36.117 --> 00:48:37.350
You know why.

539
00:48:37.584 --> 00:48:40.887
One little assignment
left incomplete.

540
00:48:40.922 --> 00:48:42.756
Even if that's true, Victor

541
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.691
what you're doing isn't right.

542
00:48:44.724 --> 00:48:48.395
Blackmail. Killing journalists.

543
00:48:49.096 --> 00:48:51.698
It's not just extreme,
it's fucking crazy, Victor.

544
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:53.567
I'm only going to warn you once.

545
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:58.906
Stay out of the way. If not for
yourself, then do it for her.

546
00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:00.106
Who her?

547
00:49:01.108 --> 00:49:02.243
Your partner.

548
00:49:02.742 --> 00:49:05.179
You weren't able to
protect my family.

549
00:49:05.812 --> 00:49:08.582
You really think you'll be
able to protect her?

550
00:50:21.088 --> 00:50:22.422
Anything?

551
00:50:24.457 --> 00:50:25.892
It's a tablet.

552
00:50:26.027 --> 00:50:27.594
The screen is cracked.

553
00:50:28.695 --> 00:50:31.831
We should still be able to
access the hard drive.

554
00:50:42.043 --> 00:50:43.044
What?

555
00:50:43.077 --> 00:50:44.078
I warned you.

556
00:50:44.444 --> 00:50:46.813
This rope-a-dope
cowboy shit got Melas killed.

557
00:50:46.846 --> 00:50:48.448
This is why we have protocols.

558
00:50:48.481 --> 00:50:50.650
This is why you got
fired once already.

559
00:50:50.684 --> 00:50:52.153
I didn't get fired, I quit.

560
00:50:52.219 --> 00:50:54.088
A man is dead, Vale.

561
00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:55.957
A civilian!

562
00:50:56.424 --> 00:50:58.725
The agency is going to
get heat for this.

563
00:50:58.792 --> 00:51:00.962
Okay, so which one
are we sad about?

564
00:51:01.262 --> 00:51:03.097
The civilian or the agency?

565
00:51:04.798 --> 00:51:05.798
Tell me.

566
00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.237
The photo that Radek left
at the scene of the crime.

567
00:51:10.271 --> 00:51:11.504
Who was it?

568
00:51:12.406 --> 00:51:16.177
Luis Del Gato.
Cuban ambassador to the UN.

569
00:51:16.543 --> 00:51:18.045
Del Gato? But he's...

570
00:51:18.112 --> 00:51:21.983
Alive. Which means Radek
doesn't just have a list of past CIA hits

571
00:51:22.049 --> 00:51:26.087
- he has a list of active targets as well.
- We need to call this into O'Malley.

572
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.888
Kate, don't you get it?

573
00:51:30.257 --> 00:51:31.725
O'Malley already knows.

574
00:51:32.093 --> 00:51:34.095
Then why is it just us here?

575
00:51:34.261 --> 00:51:35.528
If this list gets out

576
00:51:35.562 --> 00:51:38.065
it's going to unite the
entire world against us.

577
00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:40.567
Now you're starting to
ask the right questions.

578
00:51:40.633 --> 00:51:42.403
I can think of two reasons.

579
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:44.939
One: O'Malley is covering
his own ass.

580
00:51:45.538 --> 00:51:47.540
He was station chief
when I was here.

581
00:51:47.574 --> 00:51:49.210
Radek happened under his watch.

582
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:50.710
Okay, and two?

583
00:51:50.744 --> 00:51:51.979
Think about it, Kate.

584
00:51:52.013 --> 00:51:55.016
Somebody has to be leaking
the info to Radek.

585
00:51:57.351 --> 00:52:00.121
You think O'Malley is the mole?

586
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:04.992
I don't trust anybody
at the agency.

587
00:52:05.259 --> 00:52:06.726
And you shouldn't either.

588
00:52:07.527 --> 00:52:09.529
But you trust Tye Delson.

589
00:52:09.596 --> 00:52:11.298
You read her in, didn't you?

590
00:52:11.365 --> 00:52:12.766
At the art gallery.

591
00:52:13.566 --> 00:52:15.302
Don't look so surprised.

592
00:52:15.336 --> 00:52:16.803
You knew that I was
tracking you.

593
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.106
You didn't think
I would check the guest list.

594
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.342
See, you do have
the necessary trust issues.

595
00:52:21.375 --> 00:52:24.111
So why won't you direct
them toward the right people?

596
00:52:24.145 --> 00:52:29.450
Because I'm trying to make two
and two equal four with you, Vail.

597
00:52:29.883 --> 00:52:32.186
You keep saying that
we can't trust the agency...

598
00:52:32.219 --> 00:52:34.721
and then you go and read
in the head of station.

599
00:52:34.754 --> 00:52:36.223
None of this makes sense.

600
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.757
Tye is...

601
00:52:40.327 --> 00:52:42.063
She's an old friend.

602
00:52:43.164 --> 00:52:44.932
You're a hypocrite.

603
00:52:46.934 --> 00:52:47.935
Don't answer it.

604
00:52:48.635 --> 00:52:50.004
Fuck you.

605
00:52:50.171 --> 00:52:51.171
Yes, sir.

606
00:52:51.305 --> 00:52:53.573
Kate. Don't tell them.

607
00:52:53.773 --> 00:52:55.842
You really are paranoid,
aren't you?

608
00:52:57.211 --> 00:52:59.280
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

609
00:53:01.781 --> 00:53:04.751
If the CIA is responsible
for these murders

610
00:53:04.784 --> 00:53:07.354
the whole United States
will be held accountable.

611
00:53:07.388 --> 00:53:11.225
Mr. Melas paid the
ultimate price, but his death

612
00:53:11.591 --> 00:53:13.394
his sacrifice

613
00:53:13.427 --> 00:53:15.895
won't be in vain. Thank you.

614
00:53:27.408 --> 00:53:29.009
Christ, Vail.

615
00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.011
I'm here for my records.

616
00:53:49.363 --> 00:53:51.298
To my paid vacation.

617
00:53:53.633 --> 00:53:55.169
Kostas suspended all US

618
00:53:55.402 --> 00:53:59.772
intelligence activity in Greece. He's
holding a big press conference Friday

619
00:53:59.806 --> 00:54:02.209
to announce the findings
of his investigation.

620
00:54:02.243 --> 00:54:03.410
Does he have anything?

621
00:54:03.444 --> 00:54:04.811
O'Malley doesn't think so.

622
00:54:05.112 --> 00:54:08.681
But after the hit today at the
market, it doesn't look good for us.

623
00:54:09.517 --> 00:54:10.951
Did you see what happened?

624
00:54:11.684 --> 00:54:12.886
Front and center.

625
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.321
You were there?

626
00:54:15.623 --> 00:54:17.724
I saw Radek. Spoke to him.

627
00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:19.160
And?

628
00:54:22.662 --> 00:54:24.731
Did you know that the agency

629
00:54:25.065 --> 00:54:26.333
blew his cover?

630
00:54:28.135 --> 00:54:30.971
I was briefed when I took
over as head of station.

631
00:54:31.639 --> 00:54:33.207
They said it was a
necessary evil.

632
00:54:33.274 --> 00:54:36.277
It was a crime, committed by
the CIA against one of their own.

633
00:54:36.343 --> 00:54:38.889
From what I understand, the
Russians were responsible for the killing.

634
00:54:38.913 --> 00:54:42.149
Don't you dare let the agency
wash its hands of this.

635
00:54:42.216 --> 00:54:43.750
Look,

636
00:54:43.984 --> 00:54:47.354
Radek made a deal. And then one day, he
refused to hold up his end of the bargain.

637
00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:51.559
You know damn well what they asked us
to do, and you know why we couldn't do it.

638
00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:53.460
I'm not defending them, Vale.

639
00:54:53.494 --> 00:54:55.262
I'm just telling it like it is.

640
00:54:55.296 --> 00:54:56.796
The agency felt betrayed.

641
00:54:57.897 --> 00:54:59.732
Well, I know how that feels.

642
00:55:02.769 --> 00:55:04.205
I waited for you.

643
00:55:05.506 --> 00:55:06.473
I know.

644
00:55:06.507 --> 00:55:07.575
Trains came and went.

645
00:55:07.608 --> 00:55:09.343
I sat on my suitcase
and I waited.

646
00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:10.877
Vail.

647
00:55:10.911 --> 00:55:12.956
I glimpsed faces in the crowd
I kept thinking, they were you.

648
00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.982
Oh, here she comes.
There she is.

649
00:55:15.316 --> 00:55:16.783
That must be her.

650
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:17.918
They never were.

651
00:55:17.952 --> 00:55:18.952
Stop.

652
00:55:19.186 --> 00:55:21.188
You and I were supposed
to get out.

653
00:55:21.255 --> 00:55:22.889
I just... Please.

654
00:55:24.291 --> 00:55:25.492
Why didn't you come?

655
00:55:28.362 --> 00:55:29.829
I... I just

656
00:55:31.298 --> 00:55:32.399
I was scared.

657
00:55:34.301 --> 00:55:36.971
Twenty years I've been
working at this.

658
00:55:37.504 --> 00:55:40.608
This life and all the death
that comes with it.

659
00:55:41.108 --> 00:55:46.213
And it is shitty and
lonely and dreary.

660
00:55:46.313 --> 00:55:47.747
But it's all I know.

661
00:55:49.717 --> 00:55:52.419
When O'Malley called
and offered me the job

662
00:55:53.587 --> 00:55:55.755
it may have been the
wrong choice...

663
00:55:58.058 --> 00:56:00.194
but I have to live with it.

664
00:56:22.216 --> 00:56:24.251
You know, sometimes
the easiest choices

665
00:56:24.318 --> 00:56:27.021
are the ones you don't
have to make by yourself.

666
00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:15.835
When is your meeting
with O'Malley?

667
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:18.171
Tomorrow.

668
00:57:18.272 --> 00:57:20.407
He's gonna want to know
about the job.

669
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:22.375
He will.

670
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:24.511
I can't do it.

671
00:57:25.312 --> 00:57:27.815
The gangsters and the
business freaks, that's

672
00:57:27.847 --> 00:57:30.050
that's one thing, but
the politicians?

673
00:57:30.084 --> 00:57:31.518
I didn't even sign up for this.

674
00:57:31.884 --> 00:57:37.024
I hear you, Victor. But you have
an agreement with the agency.

675
00:57:38.292 --> 00:57:40.094
If you refuse

676
00:57:41.295 --> 00:57:42.963
you're a dead man.

677
00:57:45.466 --> 00:57:48.335
They can rescind their
offer to relocate your family.

678
00:57:48.836 --> 00:57:50.637
We've been here for six months.

679
00:57:51.038 --> 00:57:54.241
If the agency cared about my
family, they'd be gone already.

680
00:57:59.646 --> 00:58:01.048
This puts me in a tough spot.

681
00:58:01.081 --> 00:58:03.317
Not necessarily. This

682
00:58:04.551 --> 00:58:06.987
This could be the out
you've been looking for.

683
00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:08.655
I can't just walk away.

684
00:58:08.922 --> 00:58:11.125
What if you didn't have
to do this alone?

685
00:58:11.525 --> 00:58:12.726
I mean, think about it.

686
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.329
You, me, the girls.

687
00:58:19.466 --> 00:58:21.068
I'll get them out.

688
00:58:21.535 --> 00:58:23.270
No matter what it takes.

689
00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.342
I'll see you in Grizzly Pines.

690
00:58:29.042 --> 00:58:30.477
Grizzly Pines.

691
00:58:50.197 --> 00:58:51.832
Yep, I just received it.

692
00:58:51.899 --> 00:58:53.567
I'll be going through them now.

693
00:58:53.767 --> 00:58:54.701
Okay.

694
00:58:54.735 --> 00:58:55.735
Thank you.

695
00:58:57.337 --> 00:58:58.337
Sleeping in?

696
00:58:58.439 --> 00:59:03.710
Yeah. Got the shit
kicked out of me yesterday.

697
00:59:03.744 --> 00:59:05.179
Body needed a reset.

698
00:59:05.746 --> 00:59:06.980
Aren't you on vacation?

699
00:59:07.214 --> 00:59:08.982
I like to think of it
as work from home.

700
00:59:09.016 --> 00:59:12.519
My team was able to trace the
IP address from the ransom video.

701
00:59:12.553 --> 00:59:13.687
Oh wow.

702
00:59:13.754 --> 00:59:16.023
Sent from an abandoned
rail yard rig outside the city.

703
00:59:16.089 --> 00:59:17.558
-I
-What, what?

704
00:59:17.591 --> 00:59:20.160
Forgot to tell you. Patricio
has Radek's tablet computer.

705
00:59:20.194 --> 00:59:21.862
- Vale...
- He's going through it.

706
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:23.564
He'll let us know if
he finds anything

707
00:59:23.597 --> 00:59:26.400
Patricio couldn't find
flies on a horse's ass.

708
00:59:26.567 --> 00:59:27.801
I need that tablet.

709
00:59:27.835 --> 00:59:30.804
Could have critical information
about Radek's next moves.

710
00:59:30.838 --> 00:59:32.039
My career is on the line.

711
00:59:32.105 --> 00:59:33.440
Oh, your career?

712
00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.075
Changes everything.

713
00:59:37.377 --> 00:59:38.377
Vail.

714
00:59:40.214 --> 00:59:41.882
Maybe you should just go home.

715
00:59:42.583 --> 00:59:44.953
Look, if Kostas finds
out you're here...

716
00:59:44.985 --> 00:59:46.820
it'll just prove he was right.

717
00:59:47.187 --> 00:59:48.856
There's too much at stake, I...

718
00:59:49.389 --> 00:59:51.425
Let me send some people
down there.

719
00:59:51.658 --> 00:59:53.160
How are you going to do that?

720
00:59:53.193 --> 00:59:55.229
Your station is suspended,
remember?

721
00:59:56.797 --> 00:59:57.797
Look.

722
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:00.234
This is something I have to do.

723
01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:03.470
Radek was my friend.

724
01:00:03.972 --> 01:00:06.607
I wasn't able to save his family

725
01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:09.243
maybe I can still save him.

726
01:00:10.878 --> 01:00:12.212
Be careful.

727
01:00:39.072 --> 01:00:40.072
Let me guess.

728
01:00:40.607 --> 01:00:43.210
O'Malley wants me
on the first flight out of here.

729
01:00:43.477 --> 01:00:46.480
I didn't tell him what
happened at the market.

730
01:00:48.448 --> 01:00:50.517
Might not be good
for your career.

731
01:00:50.919 --> 01:00:54.621
Look, it's clear to me that Radek
isn't doing this for the money.

732
01:00:55.322 --> 01:00:57.658
Killing journalists,
the frame jobs.

733
01:00:57.691 --> 01:00:59.426
He wants to punish the CIA.

734
01:00:59.693 --> 01:01:03.730
The money must be for someone
else. But then, then I started to think.

735
01:01:06.466 --> 01:01:08.535
If O'Malley's working
with Radek,

736
01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:11.138
why would he send you?

737
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:14.741
And that's when I realized.

738
01:01:18.478 --> 01:01:19.646
He wouldn't.

739
01:01:21.448 --> 01:01:25.352
So I went through your bag and I
found a receipt for two burner phones.

740
01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:37.130
One incoming call.

741
01:01:37.966 --> 01:01:39.700
I'm gonna guess that's Radek.

742
01:01:42.135 --> 01:01:43.570
I killed Radek.

743
01:01:45.073 --> 01:01:46.975
Why would I work with him now?

744
01:01:47.674 --> 01:01:50.577
For all I know, you
never killed him.

745
01:01:51.878 --> 01:01:53.580
Maybe you let him go.

746
01:01:58.685 --> 01:01:59.786
Not bad at all.

747
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:19.172
Come on. We've got to get going.

748
01:02:22.977 --> 01:02:24.912
I am in contact with Radek.

749
01:02:26.279 --> 01:02:28.248
But not for the reasons
you think.

750
01:02:30.484 --> 01:02:32.552
I'll explain all on the way.

751
01:02:38.126 --> 01:02:41.194
Hi, this is Patricio.
Leave a message.

752
01:02:48.435 --> 01:02:50.604
Patricio doesn't miss calls.

753
01:02:55.509 --> 01:02:56.509
Come on.

754
01:04:14.588 --> 01:04:15.588
Stop!

755
01:04:17.058 --> 01:04:18.226
He's bait.

756
01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.895
It's a trap.

757
01:04:23.296 --> 01:04:25.032
You de-rig the platform.

758
01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.945
Spread yourselves.
No one gets out.

759
01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:15.482
Come on, come on!

760
01:05:16.316 --> 01:05:17.818
We have to get out of here!

761
01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:21.087
Vail!

762
01:05:21.388 --> 01:05:23.157
We need to get out of here.

763
01:05:23.323 --> 01:05:24.591
They're inside.

764
01:05:34.001 --> 01:05:35.735
Kate, get down.

765
01:05:47.949 --> 01:05:48.950
Wait!

766
01:05:49.217 --> 01:05:50.383
Get back! Back!

767
01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960
Kate, back up!

768
01:08:20.167 --> 01:08:21.534
Game over, Torrance.

769
01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:24.571
I give you two options.

770
01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:28.943
One, chuck your weapon
and come in for a chat.

771
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:31.946
Two, drop dead right now.

772
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.015
I'll take number two,

773
01:08:34.115 --> 01:08:35.282
with you any day.

774
01:08:37.451 --> 01:08:38.919
I knew you'd say that.

775
01:08:39.987 --> 01:08:40.987
Come on.

776
01:08:43.357 --> 01:08:46.127
Release the girl, then
I'll walk over.

777
01:08:46.293 --> 01:08:47.293
No, Vail!

778
01:08:49.562 --> 01:08:51.731
You got ten seconds to come out.

779
01:09:07.181 --> 01:09:08.983
She meets me halfway!

780
01:09:13.387 --> 01:09:14.522
The girl can go,

781
01:09:14.989 --> 01:09:18.625
say your goodbyes, and then
you and I can have a little talk.

782
01:09:19.193 --> 01:09:20.760
I'm sorry, Vail.

783
01:09:20.794 --> 01:09:21.861
Hey,

784
01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:24.198
crying is dying, kid.

785
01:09:24.631 --> 01:09:26.200
We ain't dead yet.

786
01:09:27.435 --> 01:09:29.036
I'm not leaving!

787
01:09:29.103 --> 01:09:30.438
Shut up and listen.

788
01:09:30.504 --> 01:09:32.739
Take the rear door, get
the car and leave.

789
01:09:32.772 --> 01:09:35.608
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- I will meet you at the hotel.

790
01:09:35.642 --> 01:09:37.545
- Don't do this, Vail, please.
- Kate,

791
01:09:37.577 --> 01:09:40.680
go now, or we're both dead.

792
01:10:02.136 --> 01:10:03.237
I tried to tell you.

793
01:10:04.138 --> 01:10:05.172
I'm somebody now.

794
01:10:05.406 --> 01:10:08.842
Yeah. Enjoy it. While it lasts!

795
01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.346
I told you to meet
me at the hotel.

796
01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:04.697
I knew Radek was unwell.

797
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.668
I knew the deaths of his family
would be hard on him,

798
01:11:08.701 --> 01:11:10.571
but I never thought
he'd go this far.

799
01:11:11.005 --> 01:11:13.740
What happened to Radek
and the CIA?

800
01:11:14.707 --> 01:11:16.310
How did it get to this?

801
01:11:16.911 --> 01:11:19.079
Radek was too good at his job.

802
01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.483
The agency wanted
to promote him.

803
01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:25.486
No more small-timers,
punks, gangsters.

804
01:11:25.818 --> 01:11:28.155
They wanted him to kill
a political rival.

805
01:11:28.522 --> 01:11:29.522
Who?

806
01:11:29.957 --> 01:11:34.761
Kostas. Neither of us
could go through with it,

807
01:11:34.827 --> 01:11:37.398
so we agreed to walk away.

808
01:11:37.464 --> 01:11:42.469
We underestimated how vindictive
the agency could be.

809
01:11:45.738 --> 01:11:47.107
I'm sorry.

810
01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:50.144
I'm sorry about Patricio.

811
01:11:52.845 --> 01:11:56.883
My fault. I never
should have gotten him involved.

812
01:11:59.353 --> 01:12:01.121
So what now?

813
01:12:02.722 --> 01:12:04.191
What's our next move?

814
01:12:04.258 --> 01:12:05.258
Radek's gone.

815
01:12:06.393 --> 01:12:07.727
He's beyond saving.

816
01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:10.564
No one is beyond saving.

817
01:12:10.664 --> 01:12:12.233
You saw what he did.

818
01:12:15.768 --> 01:12:18.038
I have to find him and end this,

819
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.507
once and for all.

820
01:12:31.418 --> 01:12:32.653
It's O'Malley.

821
01:12:32.819 --> 01:12:35.189
They've agreed to pay
the hundred million.

822
01:12:36.557 --> 01:12:41.161
Good. Radek won't be
able to resist.

823
01:12:55.442 --> 01:13:01.215
US embassies across Europe have
begun evacuating due to safety concerns,

824
01:13:01.649 --> 01:13:06.020
with widespread riots predicted
if Minister Kostas Leontaris

825
01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:09.822
is able to prove a link between
the CIA and these killings.

826
01:13:10.457 --> 01:13:15.162
Tune in here for the live coverage
of the press conference later today.

827
01:13:29.677 --> 01:13:30.778
Vail?

828
01:13:31.345 --> 01:13:34.814
Oh, cut the crap. I was born on
a Tuesday, but not last Tuesday.

829
01:13:34.847 --> 01:13:36.450
I knew you'd run right to her.

830
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:38.986
You must enjoy this
part of your job.

831
01:13:39.019 --> 01:13:40.621
Secret meetings in back rooms?

832
01:13:40.788 --> 01:13:42.022
Anything for my country.

833
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:48.395
All right, listen up. Radek has asked
for somebody by name to make the drop.

834
01:13:48.662 --> 01:13:50.464
Anyone else and it's off.

835
01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:52.433
Our rising star,

836
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.400
Bannon.

837
01:13:54.435 --> 01:13:56.470
What?! You can't go.

838
01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:58.339
We have no choice.

839
01:13:58.405 --> 01:14:01.008
Come on, O'Malley. You know
Radek only asked for her to get to me.

840
01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:03.911
You're done, Vail.
Thank you for your service.

841
01:14:04.211 --> 01:14:05.312
Excuse me?

842
01:14:05.679 --> 01:14:09.216
I think it's safe to say you've done
enough damage across this city.

843
01:14:09.249 --> 01:14:10.249
You're out.

844
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:23.797
O'Malley,

845
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:28.369
you might be the dumbest son of a
bitch to ever cash a government paycheck

846
01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:30.504
and that's saying something.

847
01:14:46.854 --> 01:14:47.921
Bannon.

848
01:14:50.357 --> 01:14:51.357
You got this?

849
01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:53.394
That's what I'm here for.

850
01:14:53.694 --> 01:14:54.728
He knows our faces.

851
01:14:55.262 --> 01:14:57.064
So, we can't get too
close to you,

852
01:14:57.097 --> 01:14:59.666
but we'll be tracking you
every step of the way.

853
01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:00.768
We've got your back.

854
01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:02.336
Remind me how that usually goes?

855
01:15:02.636 --> 01:15:06.106
It helps to remember
we're the good guys Bannon.

856
01:15:08.442 --> 01:15:09.710
I know who I am, sir.

857
01:15:09.877 --> 01:15:11.979
The Bitcoin is loaded
onto the flash drive.

858
01:15:12.146 --> 01:15:16.216
Once Radek takes possession,
we'll grab him, bring him in.

859
01:15:44.978 --> 01:15:46.713
Three stops, correct?

860
01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:48.281
Affirmative.

861
01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:51.018
Copy that.

862
01:16:18.512 --> 01:16:19.746
I have the package.

863
01:16:29.556 --> 01:16:30.624
Bingo.

864
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:38.298
I found the tavern.

865
01:18:46.126 --> 01:18:49.030
This is why nobody does
business with the CIA.

866
01:18:49.329 --> 01:18:50.965
They cannot follow directions.

867
01:18:51.498 --> 01:18:53.500
That was a low blow, Victor.

868
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.701
Asking for Bannon?

869
01:18:55.135 --> 01:18:56.837
I thought it was kind of funny.

870
01:18:56.903 --> 01:18:59.506
No. Killing my friend.

871
01:18:59.539 --> 01:19:02.242
I warned you to not
get involved.

872
01:19:02.944 --> 01:19:06.780
Seems like anyone who gets
close to you ends up in the dirt.

873
01:19:06.948 --> 01:19:08.916
So why don't you come down,

874
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:10.417
collect your money?

875
01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:12.452
You and I can get real close.

876
01:19:12.954 --> 01:19:14.454
Even as we speak.

877
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:17.791
You can't hide from me, Victor.

878
01:19:18.392 --> 01:19:21.029
I'll never, ever stop coming.

879
01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:23.363
I'm not going anywhere.

880
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:25.332
I'm tired, Vail.

881
01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.734
And I want to make peace.

882
01:19:28.568 --> 01:19:30.972
This sure is a fucked
up way of showing it

883
01:19:31.005 --> 01:19:32.873
There's only one
final hit to do.

884
01:19:33.807 --> 01:19:34.808
One assignment.

885
01:19:36.743 --> 01:19:37.743
Kostas?

886
01:19:37.778 --> 01:19:38.778
That's right.

887
01:19:38.946 --> 01:19:40.447
A list is nothing.

888
01:19:40.847 --> 01:19:42.883
They're just words on paper.

889
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:46.087
But seeing, that is believing.

890
01:19:46.353 --> 01:19:48.622
I'm going to broadcast
to the whole world

891
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:51.825
what the CIA has been
doing in the shadows

892
01:19:51.993 --> 01:19:52.993
Victor,

893
01:19:54.227 --> 01:19:55.595
you kill him,

894
01:19:56.363 --> 01:19:58.265
countries will go to war,

895
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.268
millions of lives will be lost.

896
01:20:02.202 --> 01:20:05.205
Sadly, as it must be,

897
01:20:06.606 --> 01:20:08.976
I cannot suffer alone
any longer.

898
01:20:12.212 --> 01:20:13.380
Goodbye, Vail.

899
01:20:14.015 --> 01:20:19.820
Please, please tell the
girls I'll be seeing them soon.

900
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:04.898
Kate, Radek is close by. He got the
payoff he's going to assassinate Kostas.

901
01:21:05.265 --> 01:21:09.369
Get to the back alley. This place is
rigged to blow in about three seconds.

902
01:21:46.706 --> 01:21:47.706
Move over.

903
01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:44.630
Fuck.

904
01:22:57.311 --> 01:22:58.612
We're gonna lose him!

905
01:23:00.348 --> 01:23:01.781
- Brace yourself.
- What?

906
01:23:01.815 --> 01:23:02.815
Brace!

907
01:23:05.319 --> 01:23:06.187
Oh shit!

908
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.220
Come on!

909
01:23:34.681 --> 01:23:37.450
Kate, hey, you alright?

910
01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:12.552
Radek!

911
01:24:38.245 --> 01:24:39.646
As many of you know,

912
01:24:40.014 --> 01:24:46.820
my office has been aggressively
investigating the murders of Greta Becker

913
01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:49.123
and Alekos Melas,

914
01:24:49.489 --> 01:24:53.060
journalists slain on Greek soil.

915
01:25:01.268 --> 01:25:07.741
Many more innocent civilians gunned
down mere weeks after publishing articles

916
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:14.115
condemning the United States and
its foreign intelligence activities abroad.

917
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:23.157
Based on our findings,
I can confidently conclude

918
01:25:25.725 --> 01:25:28.929
the Central Intelligence Agency

919
01:25:50.717 --> 01:25:51.952
It's over, Victor.

920
01:25:53.354 --> 01:25:55.122
Do you hear me? It's over.

921
01:25:56.556 --> 01:25:58.625
Maybe for me,

922
01:26:00.127 --> 01:26:01.628
not for you.

923
01:26:04.731 --> 01:26:07.068
You have to relive
this nightmare

924
01:26:08.035 --> 01:26:09.035
forever.

925
01:26:10.603 --> 01:26:12.739
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect them.

926
01:26:17.577 --> 01:26:18.745
Me too, Vail.

927
01:26:23.551 --> 01:26:26.153
I'll see you in Grizzly Pines.

928
01:27:18.072 --> 01:27:19.106
Tye.

929
01:27:21.708 --> 01:27:26.280
No. It's Kate.

930
01:27:32.453 --> 01:27:34.288
Someone shot me.

931
01:27:34.654 --> 01:27:36.423
That would be the Greeks.

932
01:27:36.457 --> 01:27:40.660
But given all the trouble you've
caused them, I'd call you guys square.

933
01:27:44.598 --> 01:27:45.865
You okay?

934
01:27:49.036 --> 01:27:51.372
We found Radek's laptop
in the van.

935
01:27:51.738 --> 01:27:53.440
The Bitcoin wallet wasn't there.

936
01:27:54.841 --> 01:27:56.843
Sounds like there's one
last mystery to solve.

937
01:27:56.876 --> 01:28:00.981
We don't care about the money.
That's what it's there for, to plug holes.

938
01:28:01.482 --> 01:28:04.751
Notice we're watching cartoons
instead of World War III?

939
01:28:04.884 --> 01:28:07.787
That's because Kostas thinks
the CIA saved him.

940
01:28:08.122 --> 01:28:10.723
We took the liberty of
claiming you as our own.

941
01:28:10.857 --> 01:28:11.959
That must have hurt.

942
01:28:12.092 --> 01:28:15.229
We found Radek's
manifesto inside of his van,

943
01:28:15.362 --> 01:28:18.499
claiming he was killing Kostas
on behalf of the CIA.

944
01:28:18.966 --> 01:28:22.336
Plus the entire hit list,
past, present, and future.

945
01:28:22.503 --> 01:28:24.205
So just the truth then, huh?

946
01:28:24.471 --> 01:28:25.973
Truth is subjective.

947
01:28:26.739 --> 01:28:29.276
Thankfully, we found
it before anyone else.

948
01:28:29.643 --> 01:28:32.413
Radek is dead. The
list is secure.

949
01:28:33.113 --> 01:28:37.585
But you did interfere after
we told you to take a hike.

950
01:28:37.651 --> 01:28:39.819
So, all in all,

951
01:28:40.321 --> 01:28:43.357
a job done.

952
01:28:45.326 --> 01:28:46.927
I do have one question.

953
01:28:47.695 --> 01:28:49.096
Why bricklaying?

954
01:28:50.164 --> 01:28:52.166
It's what I know.

955
01:28:53.534 --> 01:28:54.702
Paid for college.

956
01:28:54.734 --> 01:28:56.604
Oh, come on.

957
01:28:56.736 --> 01:29:00.040
You could be making a killing out there
consulting, but you're laying brick. Why?

958
01:29:00.274 --> 01:29:02.943
Because when I hold
a brick in my hand,

959
01:29:03.544 --> 01:29:05.412
I know exactly what it is

960
01:29:05.913 --> 01:29:07.181
and what it will do.

961
01:29:07.747 --> 01:29:09.116
Every single time.

962
01:29:09.917 --> 01:29:12.519
Its form is its function.

963
01:29:13.721 --> 01:29:14.989
That gives me peace.

964
01:29:15.556 --> 01:29:20.394
I don't know what the fuck any
of that means, but it sounds good.

965
01:29:20.928 --> 01:29:22.762
I didn't expect you would.

966
01:29:31.372 --> 01:29:33.007
The money. I mean,

967
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.076
we can't just let him
get away with it.

968
01:29:36.744 --> 01:29:37.810
O'Malley must have it.

969
01:29:37.844 --> 01:29:39.546
He needs to be held accountable.

970
01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.848
O'Malley will get what's
coming to him.

971
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:44.985
Not from us.

972
01:29:45.185 --> 01:29:46.220
So that's it?

973
01:29:46.453 --> 01:29:47.453
We just...

974
01:29:49.256 --> 01:29:50.357
We just let it go?

975
01:29:50.391 --> 01:29:51.391
Kate,

976
01:29:53.394 --> 01:29:54.861
Radek was a complicated man.

977
01:29:54.962 --> 01:29:56.363
But I knew what drove him.

978
01:29:56.397 --> 01:29:58.165
I knew his weaknesses.

979
01:29:58.399 --> 01:29:59.767
Guys like O'Malley,

980
01:29:59.799 --> 01:30:01.268
they live for the politics.

981
01:30:01.635 --> 01:30:05.572
They'll sign a death sentence
as casually as signing a lunch bill.

982
01:30:06.173 --> 01:30:08.875
That's something I'll
never understand.

983
01:30:09.209 --> 01:30:10.377
Kate,

984
01:30:10.611 --> 01:30:12.279
I can't fight an enemy,

985
01:30:13.013 --> 01:30:15.115
I don't understand.

986
01:30:31.632 --> 01:30:34.201
Well, so long, bricklayer.

987
01:30:35.502 --> 01:30:37.304
See you around, kid.

988
01:30:58.692 --> 01:30:59.692
Oh.

989
01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:03.430
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be at the hospital.

990
01:31:03.464 --> 01:31:04.732
Checked out early.

991
01:31:05.232 --> 01:31:07.900
I was just coming
to see you right before I...

992
01:31:10.003 --> 01:31:11.939
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

993
01:31:12.306 --> 01:31:14.942
I thought I'd get out
of town for a while.

994
01:31:15.642 --> 01:31:17.378
Why don't I get you a drink?

995
01:31:17.845 --> 01:31:21.648
Sure. Still a little
doped up on painkillers.

996
01:31:22.816 --> 01:31:25.152
Should be a good combination.

997
01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:28.322
Where are you going?

998
01:31:28.888 --> 01:31:30.057
Maldives.

999
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:35.062
Maldives, sounds exotic.

1000
01:31:37.731 --> 01:31:39.066
Never been.

1001
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:53.080

Really?

1028
01:33:44.024 --> 01:33:45.626
So you

1029
01:33:47.427 --> 01:33:48.662
and Radek,

1030
01:33:48.862 --> 01:33:50.197
you gave him the list.

1031
01:33:50.264 --> 01:33:52.866
He came to me. He knew about us.

1032
01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:54.401
I didn't have a choice.

1033
01:33:58.405 --> 01:34:01.408
So the hundred million
was just for shits and giggles.

1034

You've already donated it to,

1035
01:34:03.243 --> 01:34:05.412
what's that charity you like?

1036
01:34:05.779 --> 01:34:07.114
Childhood obesity?

1037
01:34:08.048 --> 01:34:10.083
I should have left with you.

1038
01:34:10.684 --> 01:34:11.684
But I didn't.

1039
01:34:12.653 --> 01:34:14.254
And now...

1040
01:34:15.122 --> 01:34:17.658
I'm not the same person anymore.

1041
01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:20.227
Clearly.

1042
01:34:21.428 --> 01:34:23.297
Goodbye, Vail.

1043
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:38.291
You okay?

1044
01:37:38.658 --> 01:37:40.360
You're welcome.

1045
01:37:57.878 --> 01:38:00.447
I can't believe you thought
I was dirty.

1046
01:38:00.714 --> 01:38:01.714
I may be a prick,

1047
01:38:01.949 --> 01:38:05.219
but I'm a patriot. I believe
in what we're doing here.

1048
01:38:05.485 --> 01:38:07.687
How did you know Delson
was dirty?

1049
01:38:07.888 --> 01:38:09.689
Something Vail said to me.

1050
01:38:10.024 --> 01:38:11.993
About knowing your enemy.

1051
01:38:12.059 --> 01:38:13.928
I knew Tye. She...

1052
01:38:14.262 --> 01:38:15.395
She was me.

1053
01:38:15.462 --> 01:38:18.799
Still the hell of a clean
up we had to do.

1054
01:38:19.499 --> 01:38:21.802
Your persona non grata
in Greece now.

1055
01:38:22.702 --> 01:38:27.507
And I'm sorry to say that you're
no longer welcome in this division.

1056
01:38:27.541 --> 01:38:30.278
- Sir, I...
- I don't want to hear anything else.

1057
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:31.611
Pack your things.

1058
01:38:32.445 --> 01:38:34.081
I'm moving you upstairs.

1059
01:38:35.382 --> 01:38:36.783
You're not dismissing me?

1060
01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:38.318
You're moving up a floor.

1061
01:38:38.351 --> 01:38:39.886
I'm promoting you.

1062
01:38:40.453 --> 01:38:42.990
You think I don't know
what a prick Vail is?

1063
01:38:43.057 --> 01:38:44.524
You did a great job over there.

1064
01:38:44.558 --> 01:38:46.994
You're going to be running
your own cases now.

1065
01:38:48.328 --> 01:38:50.630
I'm sorry, but I...

1066
01:38:51.398 --> 01:38:52.599
can't accept.

1067
01:38:53.301 --> 01:38:54.367
You're kidding me.

1068
01:38:54.401 --> 01:38:56.037
I appreciate that, sir, I do.

1069
01:38:56.369 --> 01:38:58.572
And I do want to serve
my country, just...

1070
01:38:59.372 --> 01:39:00.707
not here.

1071
01:39:01.675 --> 01:39:02.843
Thank you.

1072
01:39:23.998 --> 01:39:25.365
Hey

1073
01:39:26.234 --> 01:39:29.569
Come on. Come on.

1074
01:39:30.537 --> 01:39:32.405
Alright, let's go.
