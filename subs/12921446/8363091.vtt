You all right?

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.636
What's going on?

47
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.222
I met this woman today

who gave me the most beautiful

49
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.812

Hmm.

55
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.837
Jesus, cover this place
with your love.

56
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.131
God.

57
00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.800
(grunts) Whew.

58
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.428
(Victor sighs)

59
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.180
You think they'll let me
go up in the bell tower

60
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.098
and take a shot of the whole city?
Mm.

61
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.600
What you think?

62
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.059
- Go for it.
- Let's go.

63
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.895
No, baby, my feet hurt.

64
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:32.814
(Victor sighs)

65
00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.441
We should go back.

66
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.193
No, you go ahead,
go get the shot.

67
00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.111
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.321
All right. I love you.

Sorenne!

83
00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:29.681

Protect her.

84
00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.980

You don't... I-I...
I speak English.

89
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.756
He's saying that your wife has
serious injuries.

90
00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:08.052
Anything we do to keep her
alive will endanger your child.

91
00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.928
Your baby.

92
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.807
- I don't understand.
- (speaking Haitian Creole)

93
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.684
It's a difficult choice.

94
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.021
We cannot save them both.

95
00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.524
DOCTOR:
We are so sorry.

96
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.754

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.831
VICTOR:
Angela?

100
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.833
Got to get a move on.

101
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.752
Ange.

102
00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.214
20 minutes.

103
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.467
All right.

104
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.886
Hurry up
and finish your breakfast.

105
00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:35.180
- Slept in past my alarm.
- You can have it.

106
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.182
You eat it.
I'm not eating meat anymore.

107
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.642
Talking about?

108
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.018
Oh, it's that documentary
you watched, right?

109
00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.645
Gave you bad dreams
like I told you it would?

110
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.230
Poor little piggies.
I mean, think about it.

111
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.566
You're just enjoying your day
chilling in a mud bath,

112
00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.359
and then...
(makes buzzing sound)

113
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.986
And then...
(makes slashing sound)

114
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:51.739
All 'cause some farmer
got sick of eating oatmeal.

115
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.615
So, ice cream for breakfast.

116
00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.992
Fine with me.

117
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.785
You got that math thing today, right?

118
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.203
Math Champ Challenge.
It's tomorrow.

119
00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.539
Don't bite your nails.

120
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.249
Um, I was wondering

121
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.710
if I could do homework
at Katherine's today?

122
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.670
Like, go home with her?
Her dad can bring me home.

123
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.672
Well, I was thinking that

124
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.382
we could just do
what we always do.

125
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.301
You know, I come get you after
school, you come to the studio,

126
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.094
do your homework, we spend time together...
Yeah, I know.

127
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.596
- That's-that's what I'm asking.
- Which we never do.

128
00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.847
That's what I'm saying.

129
00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.807
I mean, I do have friends,
you know.

130
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.225
Yeah, I know you have friends.

131
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.728
You know, b-but what I'm saying
is, like...

132
00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.231
- Poor little piggies!
- I'm your friend.

133
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.733
Angela,
we don't have time for this.

134
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.067
(dishes clatter)

135
00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.737
Very sweet.

136
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.572
Very funny.

137
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.575
- Somebody sees one documentary.
- (door slams)

138
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.911
(Victor laughing)

139
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.164
You know, it's very mature.

140
00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.084
Angela.

141
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.419
Damn it.

142
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.088
Ange.

143
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.342
(door creaks open)

144
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.761
Okay.

145
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.972
We're doing this.

146
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.726
Angela RenÃ©e Fielding.

147
00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.270
This is not a game.

148
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.481
It's time to go now.

149
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.275
Right now.

150
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.157
- (Victor shouts)
- (Angela screams, laughs)

151
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.076
Aha! Yeah, yeah!

152
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:19.953
Stop. Fine, fine.

153
00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:21.787
- The master!
- Yeah, eat this.

154
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.205
Enjoy the taste of your poor,
defenseless little animal.

155
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.915
- Please. Please.
- I will. I will enjoy the taste

156
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.292
of this poor, defenseless animal.
(Angela laughs)

157
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.919
STUART:
Hey, Angela!

158
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.463
Tell your dad
I'll meet him at the gym.

159
00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.548
ANGELA:
You got it, Mr. Mullen.

160
00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.633
You can tell him yourself.

161
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.468
Hey, what's up?

162
00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.554
- Hey.
- What?

163
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.305
- Where'd you get this?
- Oh, I, um,

164
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.766
got it at the store
with my allowance.

165
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.561
Don't lie to me now.

166
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.145
I found it with Mom's stuff.

167
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.897
- Just thought it was nice.
- Your mom's stuff?

168
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.899
Or through your dad's stuff?
'Cause I think I remember

169
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.235
- where I put it.
- ANN: Hey, Mr. Fielding.

170
00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.945
Mr. Fielding,
you're going to leave

171
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.239
your trash cans
out here all week?

172
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.491
You just take the cans,

173
00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.159
and you drag 'em
down your driveway.

174
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.579
- Nice to see you, too.
- Try being a neighbor.

175
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.372
Forgot to bring 'em in, huh?

176
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:06.832
It was your turn.

177
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.085
I do first and third Tues...

178
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.920
(chuckling):
I'm-I'm sorry, okay?

179
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.672
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, leave 'em.

180
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.050
- She could use the excitement.
- (engine starts)

181
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.308
(both blow raspberries)

182
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.229
- (tires screech)
- (horn honks)

183
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:32.816
KATHERINE:
Shut up, okay?

184
00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.028
TONY:
Do not park... Oh, my gosh.

185
00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.362
- (horn honking)
- VICTOR: One sec.

186
00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.281
TONY: Can't park there. That's a bus lane.
- One second.

187
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.366
Come on! -HANNAH: Katherine's
wearing flip-flops to school?

188
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.701
Give that back!

189
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.077
- Hey, that's mine!
- MIRANDA: Flip-flops?

190
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.621
Katherine, what happened
to your new shoes?

191
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:46.872
Tyler colored on them
with Magic Marker.

192
00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.332
TONY:
Not today, guys. Not today.

193
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.167
You said they gave you blisters.
Shut up!

194
00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.044
Don't tell your sister to shut up.
Okay, I got to go.

195
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.962
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. -She's got
something on her lips. Hey.

196
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.380
HANNAH: You're stepping on my
backpack! Hands off! Get off!

197
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.007
- TONY: I want it off.
- You're embarrassing me.

198
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.717
You call us when you get
to Deshannah's. -I will.

199
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.469
- Promise me. Promise me.
- I will!

200
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.387
- Promise.
- (horn honking)

201
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.139
I shouldn't have snapped at you.
Can't park there!

202
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.849
- One sec. One second.
- That...

203
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.310
- It's a fire lane.
- One sec. Hey.

204
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.395
It's just, you know,
Mom's stuff is...

205
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.357
It's precious.

206
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.319
You be home by dinner,
all right?

207
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.114
- Thank you! (laughs)
- (horn honking)

208
00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:22.658
- I love you.
- I love you.

209
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.743
- Bye.
- Hey, you.

210
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.328
Dinner.

211
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.121
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.873
- Love you.
- Good morning, Mr. Fielding.

213
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.041
Morning, Katherine.

214
00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.085
"For the rare and radiant maiden

215
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.461
whom the angels name Lenore..."

216
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.837
(Angela and Deshannah
whispering indistinctly)

217
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.089
"Nameless here for evermore..."

218
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.590
DESHANNAH:
A sÃ©ance?

219
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.008
Just tell them that we're
doing homework, all right?

220
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.927
My dad agreed,
so don't worry about it.

221
00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.929
I don't think he's gonna call Miranda.
STUDENT: Shh!

222
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.389
(whispering continues
indistinctly)

223
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.516
Quiet!

224
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.934
What if he calls?

225
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.227
(over TV): "to still
the beating of my heart,

226
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.145
"I stood repeating
"Tis some visitor

227
00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.022
"'entreating entrance
at my chamber door...

228
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.941
- (indistinct whispering)
- "'Some late visitor

229
00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.068
"'entreating entrance
at my chamber door;...

230
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.736
- This it is and nothing more.'"
- Shh!

231
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.322
What if they call?

232
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.199
They're not gonna.

233
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.159
What if they do?

234
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.786
Tell them we were just
doing homework,

235
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.454
and then we, like,
just left for home.

236
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.580
Okay? Say, "For home."

237
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.083
What did I say?!

238
00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.294
STUART:
One, two! One, one, two!

239
00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.338
One, one, two!

240
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.548
One, two!

241
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.049
You got to suck the air
out of your teeth.

242
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.342
It's a thing, right?

243
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.302
One, two! One, one, two!

244
00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.638
What you got going on
this weekend?

245
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.474
Angie's got a soccer thing
all day Saturday. You?

246
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.310
My church is having
a pancake lunch on Sunday.

247
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.645
You can both come.

248
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.938
Some of us get
a little freaked out

249
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.566
when people start
speaking in tongues.

250
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.153
(school bell rings)

251
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.696
Okay. Exactly.

252
00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.949
And so, my dad's not gonna call
'cause he's going to the, um...

253
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.161
(engine idling)

254
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.168
KATHERINE:
What are we doing? (laughs)

255
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.836
ANGELA: "What are we doing?"
This is your idea.

256
00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.963
KATHERINE:
You know something's out there.

257
00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.175
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

258
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.597
ANGELA:
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

259
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.432
KATHERINE: We light the candle
and hold the pendulum

260
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.726
and ask the spirit
yes-or-no questions

261
00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.187
about angels and demons
and devils

262
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.272
and pastors and saints.

263
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.191
ANGELA: And lions and tigers
and bears and...

264
00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.734
- KATHERINE: Shut up.
- (laughing)

265
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.277
Watch this.

266
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.696
Uh... (laughing): Okay,
what are you, insane?

267
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.364
- Whoo!
- Excuse you.

268
00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.949
(laughter)

269
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.868
You can light your own candles.

270
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.120
Get your sticks
and rub them together

271
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.082
like you did at camp.

272
00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.170
(birds chirping)

273
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.552
- Boo! (laughs)
- (screams)

274
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.222
DAD:
It's been a while. Yeah.

275
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.640
- All right, here we go.
- MOM: Nice and tall. Whoo!

276
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.100
- DAD: Come on, buddy.
- VICTOR: That's not bad.

277
00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.351
- DAD: Let's smile.
- VICTOR: Okay.

278
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.228
That's not bad at all.
Ah, there we go.

279
00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.854
MOM:
I like this, but I also think

280
00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.231
have the kids in the middle...

281
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.982
Do you want...
Do you want her and then him?

282
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.234
Let's get you guys
closer together.

283
00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.735
Can we get...
get a little closer?

284
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.028
- MOM: Come on, honey.
- DAD: Come on.

285
00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.321
VICTOR:
Get you right in the front.

286
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.281
- Hang you upside down?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.324
(laughing)

288
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.867
VICTOR:
Where's Dad? Everybody!

289
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.077
- Come right here.
- Come back.

290
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.079
- DAD: Smile.
- I am!

291
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.288
- (crying)
- (camera clicks)

292
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.581
DAD: I'm gonna teach you
how to be a man.

293
00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.749
I-I'm getting good stuff.

294
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.251
- (laughing)
- (snarling)

295
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.710
I'm gonna count to three.

296
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.420
One, two...

297
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.631
(yelling)

298
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.967
(birds cawing)

299
00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.301
(girls laughing)

300
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.262
KATHERINE:
You light a candle

301
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:34.058
and just clear your mind.

302
00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.187
Just start speaking
what she says to you.

303
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.071
Okay.

304
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.907
(raspy):
Angela.

305
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.784
- Angela.
- (raspy): Katherine.

306
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.954
- (laughing)
- That's so creepy.

307
00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.628
(chuckles softly)

308
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.673
(electrical buzzing)

309
00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.075
(crickets chirping)

310
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.720
Come on.

311
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.681
(sighs)

312
00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.230
(door closes)

313
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.399
Ange?

314
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.027
You asleep?

315
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.040
Ange?

316
00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.174
ANGELA (recorded):
Hey, it's Angela.

317
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.968
I don't check this, so text me.

318
00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.470
Bye.

319
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.315
(drawer closes)

320
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.566
MIRANDA:
Hello?

321
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.110
VICTOR:
Hi. Hey. This is, um...

322
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.653
This is Victor Fielding,
Angela's dad.

323
00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.738
She said she was coming over
to Katherine's house

324
00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.824
to do homework this afternoon.

325
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.742
- I was just... was looking...
- MIRANDA (over phone): No.

326
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.494
- Are they still...
- Uh, Katherine told me

327
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:02.205
she was going over to study
at Deshannah's house.

328
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.540
I'm sorry, who is that?

329
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.208
Deshannah Young?
A friend of Katherine's.

330
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.085
She told me they were gonna go
over there and study.

331
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.461
- They're there?
- Maybe Angela's with them?

332
00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.505
The girls are at
Deshannah's house?

333
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.965
Yeah, you know, maybe
they're studying together.

334
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.591
Let me give her mom a try.

335
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.261
Okay, give me a call back
if you... if you don't mind.

336
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.264
- Yep.
- Thanks.

337
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.313
Hold on just a second.
It's Deshannah.

338
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.606
Do you know where
they were going?

339
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.859
DESHANNAH: I don't know
where they were going.

340
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.110
They just wanted me to say

341
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.903
they were here
in case anyone called.

342
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:37.282
Well, did you see them together
or did you see where they went?

343
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.284
This is, uh... this is Tony.
I'm Katherine's father.

344
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.495
Did-did you see them
get in a car with anybody?

345
00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.289
DESHANNAH:
They were just walking.

346
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.625
Walked away,
walked into the woods.

347
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.461
TONY:
I'm getting my coat.

348
00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.464
â™ª â™ª

349
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.467
- Katherine!
- Katherine!

350
00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.136
Angela!

351
00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.642
Katherine!

352
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.272
Where are the police?

353
00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:10.482
They said they'd be here soon.

354
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.318
- Katherine!
- Katherine!

355
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.696
- Angela!
- MIRANDA: Katherine!

356
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:19.032
(panting)

357
00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.784
- TONY: Why did...
- (distant sirens)

358
00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.160
All right, they're on
their way. See, that's them.

359
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.412
- They're getting here.
- Okay.

360
00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.671
TONY:
Honey, it's Mom and Dad!

361
00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.845
Katherine!

362
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.436
MIRANDA:
Katherine!

363
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.773
VICTOR:
Angela?

364
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:53.859
TONY:
Katherine!

365
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.041
Tony!

366
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.001
- Katherine!
- TONY: Miranda!

367
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.545
MIRANDA:
They've been here.

368
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.965
They've been here.
She's been here.

369
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.481
- (hissing)
- (grunts)

370
00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:51.834
â™ª â™ª

371
00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.924
(muffled, distorted laughter)

372
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.762
(siren wailing)

373
00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:05.681
(tires screeching)

374
00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.517
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

375
00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.772
DETECTIVE KONIK:
And here are your daughters.

376
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.108
Angela and Katherine.

377
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.110
They depart campus after school.

378
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:22.405
They proceed at 2:45.

379
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.616
That's about seven hours ago.

380
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.701
And that's the last
information we have.

381
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:29.287
- We found their shoes...
- No, we found their shoes.

382
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.663
- But no footprints.
- (Miranda sighs)

383
00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.957
TONY: What about that
homeless camp out there?

384
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.626
Someone...

385
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.294
Somebody is living out there.
There are people out there.

386
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.837
MIRANDA: There's got to be
somebody that knows.

387
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:39.464
KONIK: I understand. There is
a transient community...

388
00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:40.882
- TONY: Transient community?
- KONIK: Yes.

389
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.342
Is that what you call
a bunch of fucking bums?

390
00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:44.427
KONIK: So far,
the interviews with them

391
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.095
do not indicate
any connection...

392
00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.639
That's shocking. Shocking.

393
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.349
Is there anything else going on
with your daughter...

394
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.476
KONIK: We are looking
into every option.

395
00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.061
That we should know?

396
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.312
Pardon me?

397
00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.813
VICTOR:
That you haven't told us?

398
00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.398
To be honest with you, sir,
I didn't even know

399
00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:58.900
our daughter was friends
with your daughter.

400
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.610
Katherine is a free spirit.
She is a popular kid.

401
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.153
- She is well liked.
- If I did, this would not be

402
00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.988
the first time we were meeting,
I promise you that.

403
00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.657
She is a-a youth group leader
at our church, ma'am.

404
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.659
VICTOR: No, 'cause...
'cause what I'm saying is,

405
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.413
my daughter and I are...
we're connected, close.

406
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.249
She doesn't do
all the activities

407
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.042
like the free spirit,
so I don't know.

408
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.752
I'm just saying sometimes
there's things we don't know.

409
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.212
TONY: Well, I don't know you,
you know?

410
00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:20.672
VICTOR:
Sometimes there's things,

411
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.340
as parents, we don't know.

412
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.883
- We don't know you!
- What you know about me

413
00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.677
is that the only thing
that's ever mattered

414
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.387
is protecting my kid.
That's what you know about me.

415
00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:28.680
Well, then, where are they?

416
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.348
- (Tony shouts)
- Okay.

417
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.891
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

418
00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.518
- MIRANDA: Where could they be?
- Hey. Listen up. Okay.

419
00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.061
MIRANDA: That's what
we need to worry about.

420
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.355
I know you're all upset.

421
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.481
(Tony groans)

422
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:40.733
I know you're all stressed.

423
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.694
The good news is
they left together.

424
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:46.281
Statistically, it's likely your
girls are just out being girls.

425
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:50.702
We need to recognize that
we all have a common goal here.

426
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.539
Let's get your girls home safe.

427
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:57.126
Let's do that. Right now.

428
00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:12.599
KONIK:
All the surrounding counties

429
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.850
- should be looped in.
- MAN: Excuse me, Mr. Officer.

430
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:15.727
Don't act like
you don't know me.

431
00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:17.520
KONIK: See if they can increase
their patrols in the area...

432
00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:19.606
MAN: My name is Mark Garbage.
Mr. Garbage. (laughs)

433
00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.149
Don't steal my stuff.

434
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.900
OFFICER: We're just asking
questions, all right?

435
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.736
Asking if you've seen anything,

436
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.654
trying to figure out
who might have seen something.

437
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.406
You don't know nothing.

438
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.866
We weren't looking or nothing.

439
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:32.119
- Just out here doing nothing.
- (sniffing)

440
00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:41.753
DESHANNAH:
"The jaws that bite,

441
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.421

457
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.999
REPORTER: I'm joined now
by the pastor of the church

458
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.502
and the mother of one
of the missing girls.

459
00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:24.629
How are you holding up?

460
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.548
If she's out there
and she can hear this,

461
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:29.550
please come home.

462
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:32.720
We're praying for Katherine
and her friend Angela.

463
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.640
And Angela's father,
who's suffering along...

464
00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.768
(busy chatter)

465
00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:42.980
(scraping loudly)

466
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.774
VICTOR: I know you said
you didn't see her,

467
00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.735
but did you see any other kids
out there in the woods?

468
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:49.445
(chuckles) There's kids.

469
00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:51.656
VICTOR:
Yeah, that's what I'm...

470
00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:54.450
- Tell me about them.
- (chuckling)

471
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:56.035
MARK:
Kids come out there.

472
00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:59.832
You know, the ones, uh,
that got no place to be.

473
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.503
- There's other kids, too.
- (man laughs)

474
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:08.715
Kids that don't want to be
told what to do.

475
00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:11.592
Kids that don't want to go home,

476
00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:14.554
even though they got good ones.

477
00:25:14.555 --> 00:25:16.472
Run off looking for things.

478
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:18.182
Doing things ought not be done.

479
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.519
No, no, that's not...
that's not my kid.

480
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.731
Maybe a kid like that,
she don't find her mama.

481
00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:26.524
(laughs) Mommy. Mommy.

482
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:29.110
Mommy! (laughs)

483
00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:31.696
Maybe, uh, find
something else instead.

484
00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.699
Mommy. Mommy.

485
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.300
(engine shuts off)

486
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.953
(objects rattling)

487
00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:24.583
- (object clinking)
- (zipper zipping)

488
00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:27.961
Hello?

489
00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.177
(match strikes)

490
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:48.272
Hey, Victor.
Oh, good, you're home.

491
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.608
This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.

492
00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:54.279
(chanting, speaking Yoruba)

493
00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.865
STUART: It's okay. It's...
Uh, they're-they're with me.

494
00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:59.617
It's the...
This is a good thing.

495
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.619
- This is...
- VICTOR: Is Angela here?

496
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.162
No, she's not here.
This is Dr. Beehibe.

497
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:04.956
- Is Angela here?
- No, no, she's not here.

498
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:06.207
- This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.
- We're doing a blessing.

499
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.458
We are bringing her back.

500
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:08.960
We want to bring her back protected.

501
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.628
- This is... This is okay.
- We want her to come back.

502
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.004
STUART: She's doing
a blessing on her room.

503
00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.298
That-that's all,
just-just to keep Angela safe.

504
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.967
I need you to get everybody out.

505
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:17.468
STUART:
Uh, ladies, come on.

506
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.220
- VICTOR: Faster, Stu.
- Come on.

507
00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.014
Come on.

508
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:25.017
Hey, pal, I was just
trying to help.

509
00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:27.187
- Get the fuck out.
- Okay.

510
00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:54.339
- (door slams)
- (thunder rumbling)

511
00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:04.057
STUART:
When my sister was sick...

512
00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:07.227
and we did all we could...

513
00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.938
for her to find relief,

514
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:13.858
she had to go outside

515
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.652
of her belief system,
outside of my beliefs.

516
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.404
(sighs softly)

517
00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:19.780
We're your neighbors.

518
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:22.533
And we just want
to be there for you

519
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.120
and-and do anything that we can.

520
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:27.705
(sharp inhale)

521
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.790
(thunder rumbling)

522
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:32.376
She doesn't have her raincoat.

523
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.004
FARMER'S SON:
Dad, Dad, she has the fever!

524
00:28:35.005 --> 00:28:36.756
I just come out
and she went down!

525
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:39.008
Hurry and get the kit.
I'll call Dr. Bethero.

526
00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:41.552
The tub and the mat.
Bring me the whole thing.

527
00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.763
- Okay. Okay.
- Hurry and get the kit.

528
00:28:43.764 --> 00:28:45.514
- Bring a blanket.
- Yeah.

529
00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:46.682
Bring a blanket, too.

530
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:48.060
Blanket.

531
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.990
(goats bleating)

532
00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:22.761
(frantic rummaging)

533
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:28.308
(animallike squealing)

534
00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:44.449
Dad?

535
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.701
Where are we?

536
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:48.536
Dad!

537
00:29:48.537 --> 00:29:50.997
(horn honking)

538
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:54.459
- (tires squealing)
- (horns honking)

539
00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.135
Hey. (panting)

540
00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:05.678
- Where is she? She's this way?
- She's just admitted.

541
00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:07.014
Come here.

542
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:11.142
TONY: You are not...
You are not in trouble.

543
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.643
MIRANDA:
You're not in trouble.

544
00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.353
- TONY: You're not grounded.
- MIRANDA: Mommy and Daddy

545
00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:16.314
- aren't gonna be mad at you.
- But you have to...

546
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.607
Angela.

547
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:19.985
Okay, okay, sir...

548
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.990
VICTOR (crying):
Hey.

549
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:30.911
- Are you hurt?
- Are you mad at me?

550
00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:33.706
No, I'm not mad at you. Uh-uh.

551
00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:36.042
I'm so sorry.
I lost track of time.

552
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.169
- Angela.
- Don't worry about that.

553
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.671
Can you tell your dad
how long you've been gone?

554
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.131
How long?

555
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:43.716
Why do you keep asking me that?

556
00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:45.092
- It's important.
- Why do you keep asking?

557
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:46.469
It sounds like she wants to...

558
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.012
Angela.

559
00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:50.389
Just tell your father
the same thing you told me.

560
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.349
How long do you think
you were gone?

561
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.603
I don't know, uh...

562
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:59.191
A few hours?

563
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:05.530
No.

564
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:10.035
Baby, you've been gone
three days.

565
00:31:14.748 --> 00:31:16.707
(quiet chatter)

566
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.042
DR. LOWELL:
I'm Dr. Lowell.

567
00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:20.044
It's very nice
to meet you today.

568
00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:22.463
Can you tell us anything
that you remember?

569
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.923
We were just walking.

570
00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:25.216
And then it started raining.

571
00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:28.552
And we went into
that barn and...

572
00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.929
That's all I remember.

573
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.222
She don't remember
too much, um...

574
00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:33.099
DR. LOWELL:
Okay. Okay.

575
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.267
But, um, her-her feet.

576
00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:37.228
Her feet look really bad.

577
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:39.980
DR. JAFFREE: Well, in order for
us to kind of get a better idea

578
00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:43.067
of what has been going on
over the past three days,

579
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:44.568
we need to examine you.

580
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.237
DR. LOWELL: Sometimes when
children deal with either

581
00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:48.489
significant psychological
or traumatic injuries,

582
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.407
they can maybe have some
retrograde amnesia

583
00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.827
where they may not remember
events that might have happened.

584
00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:54.411
DR. TAJ:
How are you feeling, honey?

585
00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.538
Are you in pain?

586
00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:57.081
I don't know.

587
00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.833
- DR. JAFFREE: Okay. Very good.
- (camera clicking)

588
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:00.751
DR. LOWELL: Has she ever been
treated with hypnosis? -No.

589
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.753
- Ah.
- Anybody in the family have

590
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.421
any, um, psychiatric illnesses?

591
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.257
No. She's healthy.
She's real strong.

592
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:07.925
DR. JAFFREE: So I'm gonna
take down the buttons, okay?

593
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.760
DR. CARR: Dad, if you have any
questions at any time, just...

594
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.262
DR. LOWELL: Does she have
access to any medications

595
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:12.596
- around the house?
- VICTOR: No.

596
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.432
- (camera clicks)
- Okay.

597
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:17.601
- What's going on here?
- TONY: Hi, honey.

598
00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.270
Um, this is Dr. Lowell.

599
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.938
- Hi, ma'am. I'm Dr. Lowell.
- Why didn't you wait on me?

600
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.439
DR. CARR:
Feel free to stand next to her.

601
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.191
DR. JAFFREE: Okay,
we'll start again from the top.

602
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.818
I'm just gonna touch you
right here, okay? Gonna just...

603
00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:28.070
She's not complaining of any
pain, but she's disoriented,

604
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:30.948
which can happen
with head trauma.

605
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.408
We're just gonna
take a look over here.

606
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:34.118
DR. JAFFREE: Okay, very good.
Thank you, Joe.

607
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.954
Now we have to do one last
portion of the exam.

608
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.372
It's a little bit uncomfortable.

609
00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:40.291
These here,
these are called stirrups.

610
00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:41.750
And, Dad, if you're okay, this
is the more sensitive part.

611
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.460
Just gonna change my gloves.

612
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:44.962
Hey, babe, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna see you

613
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.255
in a few minutes, okay?

614
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:47.756
If at any point
you feel discomfort,

615
00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:49.091
please let me know.

616
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.467
You're gonna feel
a little bit of cold jelly

617
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:53.804
and lots of pressure,
but no pain, okay?

618
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.472
Just a little bit
of pressure, okay?

619
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:58.767
I'm just gonna be
taking a few samples.

620
00:32:58.768 --> 00:32:59.977
DR. JAFFREE:
I'm looking to see

621
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:01.395
if your hymenal ring
is still intact.

622
00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:04.648
Sometimes when people are
touched inappropriately,

623
00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.234
those things can be damaged.

624
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:09.195
- DR. TAJ: We are all done.
- DR. JAFFREE: Here you go.

625
00:33:09.196 --> 00:33:11.323
Yeah, you got it. Good girl.

626
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.203
KONIK: We conducted
rigorous physical exams

627
00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:18.787
and cognitive interviews.

628
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:20.206
There's no sign of distress,

629
00:33:20.207 --> 00:33:22.416
no evidence of sexual assault.

630
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.419
Toxicology is normal.
Their stories are consistent.

631
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.838
They both say they just went
to hang out in the woods,

632
00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:30.174
they got lost on the way back,
and they were afraid

633
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:32.176
of getting in trouble,
so they just kept walking.

634
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.011
Three days later, they end up
30 miles down the road

635
00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:36.847
in some farmer's barn with no
concept of time having passed.

636
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.307
They met someone out there.

637
00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:39.683
There has to be something
they're not telling us.

638
00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:41.310
I don't understand,
no concept of time...

639
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:42.561
KONIK: Our heads go
to complicated places

640
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.188
when we're faced
with undefined anomalies.

641
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:45.773
KATHERINE:
Mommy.

642
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.358
KONIK: But you guys should
consider yourselves lucky.

643
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.276
Sure, girls keep secrets,

644
00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:52.530
but every test is clean.

645
00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:55.532
Everything is perfectly normal.

646
00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.368
Can I go home now?

647
00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:59.245
(hand squeaking on glass)

648
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:00.621
ANN:
Normally, I hate it

649
00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.581
when someone I know
turns up here,

650
00:34:02.582 --> 00:34:06.168
but I got to tell you,
I just about died of happiness

651
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:08.671
when I saw your name
on the intake board.

652
00:34:08.672 --> 00:34:11.131
- (baby crying loudly)
- Now, don't you worry.

653
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:15.594
Gonna have you out of here
in no time at all.

654
00:34:15.595 --> 00:34:18.889
I had been praying for you
night and day.

655
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.558
(crying stops)

656
00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:23.561
(hand squeaking on glass)

657
00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:27.565
Can I go home now?

658
00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.570
VICTOR:
Okay.

659
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.119
You know that I love you, right?

660
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:42.747
You know
you can tell me anything.

661
00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:46.583
What were you and Katherine
doing out there in those woods?

662
00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.876
I don't know.

663
00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:50.421
I wanted to find the...

664
00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:52.424
(sighs)

665
00:34:53.883 --> 00:34:56.553
I wanted to talk to Mama.

666
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.431
Sometimes I hear her voice.

667
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.433
She talks to me.

668
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:05.687
Yeah, baby, sometimes
I hear her voice, too.

669
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.356
- It doesn't mean...
- I wanted Katherine to hear.

670
00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.942
She reads the Bible.
She goes to church.

671
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.777
I wanted to tell if I was crazy.

672
00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.448
- If it was really her.
- You're not crazy.

673
00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.204
You light a candle.

674
00:35:24.205 --> 00:35:26.290
(laughter)

675
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.083
Clear your mind.

676
00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:30.294
- (distorted screams)
- Drip, drop...

677
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:34.298
You stand in the trees holding
something that you love

678
00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:36.633
that gives you connection.

679
00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:40.095
You just start speaking
what the spirit says to you.

680
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:42.557
What did the spirit say to you?

681
00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:46.811
(distorted laughter)

682
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.822
She wasn't there.

683
00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.658
No one was.

684
00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:04.454
We took the scarf.
That was my connection.

685
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:08.375
Okay.

686
00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:17.509
Leave me alone now.

687
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.307
Yeah, of course.

688
00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:28.853
Yeah.

689
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.283
(door opens, closes)

690
00:36:43.284 --> 00:36:45.537
(soft squeaking)

691
00:36:47.539 --> 00:36:49.541
(clicking)

692
00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:53.710
(clicking)

693
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:56.505
(squeaking)

694
00:36:56.506 --> 00:36:59.384
â™ª â™ª

695
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.850
- Hey, baby.
- (gasps)

696
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.687
Go ahead and brush your teeth.

878
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.204

879
00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:38.206
The body and the blood!
The body and the blood!

880
00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:39.833
- The body and the blood!

The body and the blood!

TONY:
What about the neurologist?

885
00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:01.938
Didn't he say that hormones,
stress, they can...

886
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:04.315
they can bring on, like,
a trancelike state?

887
00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:06.109
Maybe that's why
they're not talking

888
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.111
and not... they're not
making any sense, they can't...

889
00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:09.863
They take off their shoes.

890
00:49:09.864 --> 00:49:11.906
They walk 30 miles.

891
00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:14.784
You think that's hormones, puberty?

892
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.453
MIRANDA:
No.

893
00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.039
No, I don't.

894

TONY:
Miranda, please. Not now.

895
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.917
Katherine was supposed
to be baptized a week ago.

896
00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:24.377
He doesn't even understand.

897
00:49:24.378 --> 00:49:26.129
- In our church...
- MIRANDA: Okay? And I pushed it

898
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.006
because I wanted her grandma
to be there.

899
00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:29.465
- It was selfish.
- It's not your fault.

900
00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.925
In our church, we don't
baptize them as infants.

901
00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:32.218
We wait until they're old enough

902
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:33.303
to understand
Christian discipline.

903
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:34.679
Something they did out there

904
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.473
opened them up
for an unholy spirit to enter.

905
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:40.311
That's how
demonic possession works.

906
00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:44.814
Do you know where Jesus went

907
00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.150
after he died on the cross, Victor?
TONY: Miranda.

908
00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:51.821
He went to hell to declare
his authority over the devil.

909
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:54.658
And he reappeared
three days later.

910
00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:59.245
Three days, just like our girls.

911
00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:01.999
You think they went to hell?

912
00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:06.419
Burned their feet in hell?

913
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.173
Got possessed by the devil?

914
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:14.802
TONY: Uh, pagan activity
or-or-or talking to the dead.

915
00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:16.262
Wherever those girls went,

916
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:18.349
they brought something back
with them.

917
00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:22.061
Y'all need to get some sleep.

(in deep, demonic voice):
Sister Mary Xavier.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.767
Scraped out she was,

925
00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:06.396
like a rotten pumpkin.

In an attempt to meet
this basic desire,

935
00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:37.468
we can acquire dysfunctional

You asked me if I've ever seen
anything like this before.

No.

956
00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:33.317
But there are people out there
who have.

957
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:36.277
I read this in college.

I don't believe in the question.

You know, you religious types

Something bad happens,
must be the devil.

Something good happens,
must be God.

966
00:52:57.007 --> 00:53:00.510
It is a myth made up by people

967
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:05.014
to explain things
they will never understand.

968
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.267
I already did this.

969
00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:10.144
I learned the Lord's Prayer.

970
00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:11.729
I learned the Apostles' Creed.

971
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.231
What'd I get?

972
00:53:13.232 --> 00:53:16.025
I got to watch my wife die.

973
00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:18.194
Watch them cut my baby girl
out of her stomach.

974
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.322

975
00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:24.617
Mr. Fielding, the way I see it,

976
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:27.371
that makes your daughter
a miracle.

00:53:28.414 --> 00:53:30.456
Well, I got to go
check my miracle

978
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.041
into the mental institution.

979
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.709

983
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:50.268
When I was younger,
I was going to become a nun,

984
00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:52.312
if you can believe it.

985
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.649
I thought I was ready
to give my life to the Lord,

986
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.609
but I wasn't.

987
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:02.823
And I broke
my personal commitment.

988
00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:06.285
Right before I took my vows.

989
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:12.957
I got pregnant...

990
00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:14.751
and I chose not to keep it.

991
00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.337
All novitiates choose a new name

992
00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:20.590
before they enter the convent.

993
00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:24.051
They change their name
to mark the transformation

994
00:54:24.052 --> 00:54:26.512
from their old life.

995
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:29.515
I never got to use my name,

996
00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:31.768
but your daughter just did.

997
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.646
"Sister Mary Xavier," she said.

998
00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:37.941
And she knew
what happened to my baby.

999
00:54:38.859 --> 00:54:42.571
I never told anyone
what name I had chosen.

1000
00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:46.199
Or about my pregnancy.

1001
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.118
Not then, not since.

1002
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:52.539
Not a single living soul.

I guess you could say that.

1008
00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:55.101
So did you just walk into
the Catholic church one day

1009

and say, "I want to sign up
for exorcist school"?

1010

Well, for starters,
I'm not an exorcist.

I leave that
to the professionals.

1012

driven by
my love for my daughter,

1014

The Rite of Exorcism is

one of the oldest human rituals.

for as far back as history
has been recorded,

1036
00:56:46.653 --> 00:56:49.488

negative energies

1037

and to journey toward healing.

1038
00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:54.327
From the Muslim rites
to the Hebrew dybbuks,

1039
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:56.454
to the Zoroastrian texts.

1040

There are even some incantations
for exorcism

but is demonic possession real?

I think the right question is:

1045
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.426
Are the people that I visit...

1046
00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:12.595
Is their suffering real?

00:57:24.524 --> 00:57:26.485
Father Maddox?

1050
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.907
Someone I know is suffering
and needs help.

1051
00:57:32.908 --> 00:57:34.951
â™ª â™ª

1052
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.334
- (car door closes)
- (barking)

1053
00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:45.127
VICTOR:
Look, look. Yeah.

1054
00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.879
Okay. All right.

1055
00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.006
- Good dog.
- (barking stops)

1056
00:57:49.007 --> 00:57:51.717
Where's your mommy?
Your mama home?

1057
00:57:51.718 --> 00:57:53.220
Huh?

1058
00:57:58.266 --> 00:58:00.851
VICTOR: Do you believe any
of this stuff is actually real?

1059
00:58:00.852 --> 00:58:03.312
CHRIS:
Placebos are real.

1060
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:05.690
The power of suggestion is real.

1061
00:58:05.691 --> 00:58:07.316
Belief is real.

1062
00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:10.486
I think what you're asking me is...

1063
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:15.074
if I believe any of this stuff
will really help your daughter.

1064
00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:20.371
But what you should be asking
is if you believe it.

1065
00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:22.289
Hmm. Skeptic.

1066
00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:24.166
That's good.

1067
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:26.919
But that'll only get you so far.

1068
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.172
After that, you got to come up
with some real answers.

1069
00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.675
I know some spiritual
counselors that...

1070
00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:35.594
No, no.
No, that's not what we need.

1071
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:38.013
I want to talk about Regan.

1072
00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.975
About her exorcism.

1073
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:48.691
I didn't actually witness it,
you know, the exorcism.

1074
00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:51.069
- They wouldn't let me.
- Why not?

1075
00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:53.446
My opinion,

1076
00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:55.865
it's 'cause I'm not a member
of their damn patriarchy.

1077
00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:57.533
(chuckles)

1078
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.618
I may not have
witnessed the exorcism,

1079
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:03.039
but I sure as all hell
witnessed the possession.

1080
00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:07.209
I spent the next ten years
trying to understand

1081
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.044
what I saw with my own eyes.

1082
00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:12.131
I studied every culture,
every religion,

1083
00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:14.175
every ritual for it
I could find.

1084
00:59:14.176 --> 00:59:18.137
I just learned so much
about all this stuff.

1085
00:59:18.138 --> 00:59:22.516
I wanted people to understand
that it's possible to survive

1086
00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:24.643
the most traumatic experiences

1087
00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:27.898
and not only survive but thrive.

1088
00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:31.609
VICTOR:
Is this her? Is this Regan?

1089
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:32.985
CHRIS:
Yeah.

1090
00:59:32.986 --> 00:59:34.613
That's her.

1091
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:38.616
But then the book came out.

1092
00:59:38.617 --> 00:59:41.744
It was such a huge success.

1093
00:59:41.745 --> 00:59:42.995
She hated it.

1094
00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:45.831
She never forgave me
for writing it.

1095
00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:47.541
I never forgave myself.

1096
00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:49.585
She went into hiding.

1097
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:51.003
She moved away.

1098
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:53.589
Even now, I don't know
where she is.

1099
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.675
She won't tell me.

1100
00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.931
There are many dark forces
in this world, Mr. Fielding.

1101
01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:04.309
Not all of them
are supernatural.

1102
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.603
I wake up every morning

1103
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.147
wondering where my daughter is.

1104
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.775
Praying that
I'll see her sweet face again

1105
01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.277
one of these days.

1106
01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.613
There's something
I saw in your book

1107
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.615
that made me come here today.

1108
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.785
They took some photos
in the hospital.

1109
01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:28.958
I want to help my daughter
like you helped yours.

1110
01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.127
Like you helped Regan.

1111
01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:36.925
(indistinct whispering)

1112
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.637
(praying quietly)

1113
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.808
Oh, thank God.

1114
01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:49.812
Father Maddox,
Victor, Angela's father.

1115
01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.188
And Chris MacNeil,

1116
01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.857
- the woman I told you about.
- Of course.

1117
01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:55.276
Thank you so much
for joining us.

1118
01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.987
I assume you're familiar with
our sanctioned procedures, yes?

1119
01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.196
I am.

1120
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.698
Where is she?

1121
01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.993
(door beeps, buzzes)

1122
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:10.333
(heavy, raspy breathing)

1123
01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:19.885
She knows who I am.

1124
01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.679
Where's the other girl?

1125
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.806
Taking care of her at home.

1126
01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.018
That's not a good idea.

1127
01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:35.984
(demonic voice):
She's waiting for you.

1128
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.450
(line ringing)

1129
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.703
(knocking)

1130
01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.496
There's no one home.

1131
01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:51.498
(line continues ringing)

1132
01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.125
CHRIS:
Yes, there is.

1133
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.877
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your call has been forwarded

1134
01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:56.796
to an automated...

1135
01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:02.217
â™ª â™ª

1136
01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.677
Tony?

1137
01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:05.804
Miranda.

1138
01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.182
Hey, Tony.

1139
01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.895
Miranda?

1140
01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:22.072
TONY:
Oh, my gosh.

1141
01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.576
Where did she go?

1142
01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.869
They were looking for spirits.

1143
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.120
CHRIS:
I'm Chris MacNeil.

1144
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.373
- She came home.
- I'm here to help.

1145
01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.292
Tony? Hey.

1146
01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:36.585
This is my friend Chris.

1147
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.545
She's gonna do
everything she can

1148
01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:38.463
to help our daughters.

1149
01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:39.755
We've all sinned.

1150
01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.548
We've all fallen short.

1151
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.009
But my sin has weakened me.

1152
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.053
God is punishing us.

1153
01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.471
- (Tony breathing shakily)
- Come on.

1154
01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:49.766
â™ª â™ª

1155
01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.486
Katherine?

1156
01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.793
MIRANDA: Protect our
little girl from this evil.

1157
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.462
Comfort her with your spirit.

1158
01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:24.592
Hide her from this evil realm
with your power, Lord.

1159
01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:28.137
Lord, you are the light
in the darkness.

1160
01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.473
- Surround her...
- VICTOR: Where's Katherine?

1161
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:34.310
Let's get you out of here,
all right?

1162
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.823
I know who you are.

1163
01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.784
And you know who I am.

1164
01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.495
We've met before.

1165
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.289
But I'm not talking to you now.

1166
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.460
(demonic voice):
Are you looking for Regan?

1167
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.670
Are you looking for Regan?

1168
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.922
Are you looking for Regan?!

1169
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.842
(normal voice):
Don't be scared.

1170
01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.053
We're here to help you.

1171
01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:11.472
We can tell you where she is.

1172
01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.932
All you have to do is ask.

1173
01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:16.351
I ask nothing of you.

1174
01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.771
I renounce you.

1175
01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:21.690
I come here to return life
to this child

1176
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.860
from whom it is
unwillingly taken.

1177
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.279
You don't know
what happened to her,

1178
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.989
but we do.

1179
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.617
(demonic voice):
She burns in hell!

1180
01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.495
(cackling)

1181
01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.872
(screaming)

1182
01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:39.917
(normal voice):
Mom! Help! Mother, please!

1183
01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.002
Mother, please make it stop!
It's hurting!

1184
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:45.005
In the name of all holy beings,

1185
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:49.760
in the name of
my beloved daughter Regan,

1186
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.095
- release this child.
- (screaming)

1187
01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.138
Release this child.

1188
01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.934
- Release this child!
- (groaning)

1189
01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:12.075
(Chris sighs, whimpers)

1190
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.917
Katherine.

1191
01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.096
I am no devil.

1192
01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:36.723
There is none.

1193
01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.684
â™ª â™ª

1194
01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.146
(both screaming)

1195
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.273
(screams, cries)

1196
01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.024
(demonic voice):
You want to see your beloved,

1197
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.651
cunting daughter?

1198
01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.903
(groans) Help. I...

1199
01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:51.655
Open your eyes.

1200
01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.158
Chris.

1201
01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:57.786
Sorenne!

1202
01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:01.290
(whispers):
Protect her.

1203
01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.749
Sorenne!

1204
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.627
(Chris whimpering)

1205
01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.464
(groaning)

1206
01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:12.634
- What did you do?
- Victor, no.

1207
01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.387
VICTOR:
What did you do?!

1208
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.642
(indistinct radio chatter)

1209
01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:24.147
(siren blaring)

1210
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:31.696
Tony? Tony.

1211
01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.664
I feel them. I feel those girls.

1212
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.124
I feel them.

1213
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:49.130
Mommy, why can't you make it
stop hurting?

1214
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.259
â™ª â™ª

1215
01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.304
(bell tolling)

1216
01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:12.361
FATHER MADDOX:
Most Reverend Fathers,

1217
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.363
after consideration
of all of the evidence

1218
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.281
and possible outcomes

1219
01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.742
and what I have seen
with mine own eyes,

1220
01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.161
we ask your support
in approaching the bishop

1221
01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:22.537
to sanction the exorcism.

1222
01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:24.581
Well, Father,
we are here to support you.

1223
01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.501
We want to be here for you
in-in any circumstances.

1224
01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:28.877
This is
a very dangerous situation.

1225
01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.128
Dangerous for you, Father.

1226
01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.505
Dangerous for
the Catholic church.

1227
01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:34.967
Please understand,
I have prayed with her

1228
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.593
and observed her actions.

1229
01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.429
When I... when I rest...
when I rested my hand

1230
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.224
upon her head,
I felt nothing but pain.

1231
01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:46.186
There is a-a spirit that
is present alongside of them.

1232
01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.814
We must move forward
as soon as possible

1233
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.232
with this ritual,

1234
01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.651
with the help of all of you,

1235
01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:57.531
lest the lives of two of our
Lord's young children be lost.

1236
01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:00.243
â™ª â™ª

1237
01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.123
Who's that?

1238
01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.416
- VICTOR: It's Victor.
- (door closes)

1239
01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.585
I'm so sorry
I brought you back into this.

1240
01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.421
This is my fault.

1241
01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.299
Do you know what that thing
said to me when I...

1242
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.301
I was in the room with it?

1243
01:08:17.302 --> 01:08:21.848
It tried to convince me
that Regan is dead.

1244
01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.599
What do you believe?

1245
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.769
Oh, well, I don't think that,
I'll tell you.

1246
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.439
Hope is what keeps me alive.

1247
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.233
And that's what you're gonna
have to find to do this.

1248
01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:37.112
What happened in there
wasn't your fault.

1249
01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.949
Something inside our girls
called out for help.

1250
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.951
It brought you to me.

1251
01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.494
It put me in that room.

1252
01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:47.456
Those girls are connected now.

1253
01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.374
Their families are connected.

1254
01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:52.127
I have studied
the Rite of Exorcism

1255
01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:54.505
in every culture
that I could find.

1256
01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.799
They all have
different ceremonies,

1257
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.844
but the one thing
they all have in common,

1258
01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:06.183
the most important thing
of all, is people.

1259
01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:08.518
We go to church
in times of trouble

1260
01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:11.438
because we believe
it's the house of God.

1261
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:15.859
But also, there are people
there, other people...

1262
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:19.488
Whether it's family
or neighbors or strangers.

1263
01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:23.158
Yes, they're all there
to affirm their faith in God,

1264
01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:24.743
but they're also there

1265
01:09:24.744 --> 01:09:27.829
to affirm their faith
in each other.

1266
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.623
It's not over.

1267
01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:34.336
Maybe Regan is gone, but you
can bring your daughter back.

1268
01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:38.298
You've got to bring everyone together.

1269
01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:41.386
That's what will make this work.

1270
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:45.306
â™ª â™ª

1271
01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.362
Hey, pal. Listen.

1272
01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.280
I need to get in touch
with the woman

1273
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:06.202
you had come over the house
and do the blessing.

1274
01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.538
What was her name again?

1275
01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.133
This your family?

1276
01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:22.717
No.

1277
01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:26.221
Just asking
to borrow some earth.

1278
01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.390
Now, when you take something,

1279
01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.060
you have to give something
in return.

1280
01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:34.146
How much do you know
about what I do, Mr. Fielding?

1281
01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.148
About root work?

1282
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.482
Not enough.

1283
01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:40.402
Enslaved people
that were brought here,

1284
01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.737
they relied on
traditional beliefs

1285
01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.698
about spirit
brought from Africa.

1286
01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:48.368
They combined that with native
tools to protect themselves,

1287
01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.829
and they balanced it
with the herbs and roots

1288
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:54.916
that are growing in the earth
that they're forced to till

1289
01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.461
or the shells of the ocean

1290
01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.629
that carried them
from their homes.

1291
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.506
When I had my oncology practice,

1292
01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:05.093
I didn't put much credence
in traditional healing rituals,

1293
01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:09.389
but I learned that sometimes,

1294
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:12.560
to go forward,
you have to go back.

1295
01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:16.564
Which way are you headed?

1296
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:20.735
â™ª â™ª

1297
01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.621
DR. BEEHIBE:
The beginning and the end.

1298
01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.414
This is the eternal space.

1299
01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:38.293
This is the ancestral space,
the realm of mysteries.

1300
01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.129
And what we want to do
is open up a channel

1301
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.672
to this realm

1302
01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:45.967
to give us what we need
here on earth.

1303
01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.887
And that's what
we're going to do tonight.

1304
01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.431
You need to break through
this watery realm

1305
01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.309
that is separating
these two dimensions.

1306
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:58.980
We want them to come through.
We want them to come through.

1307
01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.982
(screaming, growling)

1308
01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.609
ORDERLY:
Ready? (grunts)

1309
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.321
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

1310
01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.912
TONY:
Daddy's got you. Come on.

1311
01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:15.330
(Katherine groaning)

1312
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.999
Miranda, I'm going in.

1313
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.960
Get the door.

1314
01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.629
It's okay, baby.

1315
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.926
(bathwater running)

1316
01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.024
(liquid pouring)

1317
01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.318
(grunting)

1318
01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.530
(straining):
Down. All right.

1319
01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:50.449
- Okay.
- All right.

1320
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.828
If this doesn't work

1321
01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:57.414
and something else goes wrong
and they take her from us,

1322
01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:59.291
- I don't know what I'm...
- Miranda. Shh, shh.

1323
01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.875
Hey.

1324
01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.377
It's going to work.

1325
01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:05.255
The priest is on his way. Shh.

1326
01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:07.049
It has to work.

1327
01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.847
- Here you go, man.
- Thanks.

1328
01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.725
Check if they're even.

1329
01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.770
(drill whirring)

1330
01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:25.066
All right, we got it.

1331
01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.901
It's good, Stu.

1332
01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.487
Thanks.

1333
01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.498
Hello, Father.

1334
01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:43.168
We're almost ready.
Everyone is gathering inside.

1335
01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.421
Ann, I, um...

1336
01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.798
I spoke to the diocese,

1337
01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:51.718
and they have determined that...

1338
01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:54.721
given the circumstances,
the well-being of these girls

1339
01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:58.434
would best be helped through
psychiatric intervention.

1340
01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.603
But you...

1341
01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.605
- you know it's more than that.
- I...

1342
01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.273
- I-I am sorry.
- (sighs)

1343
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.651
Okay, but it doesn't matter.

1344
01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:09.778
I cannot be a part of this.

1345
01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.238
Please understand,
people have died

1346
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.782
on both sides of possession.

1347
01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.534
What you're doing here
is dangerous,

1348
01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.119
and it is religious interference.

1349
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.329
No.

1350
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.123
We're doing it.

1351
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.710
- With or without you, Father.
- (Maddox sighs)

1352
01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.712
- I-I...
- With or without you.

1353
01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:29.297
MADDOX:
I'm sorry, Ann.

1354
01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.634
- I just... I cannot.
- With all due respect, Father,

1355
01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.053
what do you expect us to do?

1356
01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:38.474
Sit there and watch
those children suffer?

1357
01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.105
(sighs)

1358
01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.736
Here.

1359
01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:53.571
Hold on tight.

1360
01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:56.658
You keep your distance
from them,

1361
01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:59.369
you follow
the Rule of Saint Benedict,

1362
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.870
and you stand up
to this creature

1363
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.831
with deprecatory prayer,
do you understand?

1364
01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.833
When Jesus called
his 12 together...

1365
01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.042
(sniffles)

1366
01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.837
he granted them the power
and authority

1367
01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.464
to cast out all demons,

1368
01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:13.675
- to cure all diseases.
- Yes.

1369
01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.593
And then he sent them
out into the world

1370
01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.680
to proclaim the kingdom of God
and to heal, Ann.

1371
01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.515
- Yes.
- To heal the sick.

1372
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.518
Yes.

1373
01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:31.193
The power of Christ works
through all of us.

1374
01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.865
"In my name
they shall cast out devils,

1375
01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.700
"they shall speak
with new tongues,

1376
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.201
"they shall take up serpents,
they shall

1377
01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:43.455
lay hands on the sick,
and they shall recover."

1378
01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:45.081
The girls are sleeping.

1379
01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.541
They're ready.

1380
01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.585
Has Father Maddox arrived?

1381
01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:50.170
VICTOR:
He's not gonna be joining us.

1382
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.796
TONY: What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1383
01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.798
He's not coming?
This was the entire point.

1384
01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.550
Something about the church
wouldn't let him.

1385
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.385
Miranda, this isn't
what we talked about.

1386
01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.554
(overlapping arguing)

1387
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.223
ANN:
I live...

1388
01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.934
in the name of Jesus.

1389
01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.940
Here, we are asking God

1390
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:14.652
to free these children
from infestation.

1391
01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:18.072
We are asking God to intervene.

1392
01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.992
I'm not denying the grace
of a holy priest,

1393
01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:24.622
but I can give it
everything I've got.

1394
01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:28.625
I am meant to do it.

1395
01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:30.294
I can do it.

1396
01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:35.131
I can perform the Roman Rite.

1397
01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.509
I see now

1398
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.095
why the Lord took me out

1399
01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.768
I see now why he put me
in the house next door.

1400
01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:49.897
To be here with you tonight.

1401
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.150
It's going to take all of us.

1402
01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:58.823
I like it.

1403
01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:01.282
It takes all kinds.

1404
01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.617
VICTOR:
We're here.

1405
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.786
We're together.

1406
01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.287
This can work. It'll work.

1407
01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.956
- I hope you're sure.
- VICTOR: Yeah, I'm sure.

1408
01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.542
You better be, too,
before you step in that room.

1409
01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:13.838
We all better be. Anybody else
want to leave, leave now.

1410
01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:16.966
Once we start,
we're not stopping.

1411
01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:20.928
That's it.

1412
01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.681
After you.

1413

VICTOR:
Smell got worse.

1418
01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.025
Is that Katherine's heartbeat?

1419
01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.235
They're beating in sync.

1420
01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:22.990

ANN:
Shall we begin?

1422
01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:39.256
DR. BEEHIBE:
Their vibrations are strong.

1423
01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:44.427
I call on you
to put your hands on us

1424
01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:48.390
that we might keep safe the
heart of these dear children.

1425
01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:52.268
STUART:
It's gris-gris, for protection.

1426
01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.687
DR. BEEHIBE:
Once we get started,

1427
01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:57.066
try not to touch the children.

1428
01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.406
Okay.

DR. BEEHIBE:
Put the bowls at their side.

healing in atonement
for our sisters."

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.280
DR. BEEHIBE:
It was the hyssop branch

1517
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:58.366
that was raised
to quench the lips

1518
01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.034

What are you doing?

1520

DR. BEEHIBE:
Vinegar offered in jest

1521
01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.664

DR. BEEHIBE: And when they cut
the flesh of the lamb,

It's vapor from inside.
