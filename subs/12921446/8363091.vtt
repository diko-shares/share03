Her dad can bring me home.

what we always do.

Yeah, I know you have friends.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.728
You know, b-but what I'm saying
is, like...

132
00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.231

- Try being a neighbor.

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:32.816
KATHERINE:
Shut up, okay?

184
00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.028
TONY:
Do not park... Oh, my gosh.

- VICTOR: One sec.

186
00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.281
TONY: Can't park there. That's a bus lane.
- One second.

187
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.366
Come on! -HANNAH: Katherine's
wearing flip-flops to school?

188
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.701
Give that back!

189
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.077
- Hey, that's mine!
- MIRANDA: Flip-flops?

190
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.621
Katherine, what happened
to your new shoes?

191
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:46.872
Tyler colored on them
with Magic Marker.

192
00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.332
TONY:
Not today, guys. Not today.

193
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.167
You said they gave you blisters.
Shut up!

194
00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.044
Don't tell your sister to shut up.
Okay, I got to go.

195
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.962
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. -She's got
something on her lips. Hey.

196
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.380
HANNAH: You're stepping on my
backpack! Hands off! Get off!

197
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.007
- TONY: I want it off.
- You're embarrassing me.

198
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.717
You call us when you get
to Deshannah's. -I will.

199
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.469
- Promise me. Promise me.
- I will!

200
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.387
- Promise.
- (horn honking)

201
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.139
I shouldn't have snapped at you.
Can't park there!

202
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.849
- One sec. One second.
- That...

203
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.310
- It's a fire lane.
- One sec. Hey.

204
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.395
It's just, you know,
Mom's stuff is...

205
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.357
It's precious.

206
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.319
You be home by dinner,
all right?

207
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.114
- Thank you! (laughs)
- (horn honking)

208
00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:22.658

212
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.873
- Love you.
- Good morning, Mr. Fielding.

213
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.041
Morning, Katherine.

214
00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.085
"For the rare and radiant maiden

215
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.461
whom the angels name Lenore..."

216
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.837
(Angela and Deshannah
whispering indistinctly)

217
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.089
"Nameless here for evermore..."

218
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.590
DESHANNAH:
A séance?

219
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.008
Just tell them that we're
doing homework, all right?

220
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.927
My dad agreed,
so don't worry about it.

221
00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.929
I don't think he's gonna call Miranda.
STUDENT: Shh!

222
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.389
(whispering continues
indistinctly)

223
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.516
Quiet!

224
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.934
What if he calls?

225
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.227
(over TV): "to still
the beating of my heart,

226
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.145
"I stood repeating
"Tis some visitor

227
00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.022
"'entreating entrance
at my chamber door...

- "'Some late visitor

"'entreating entrance

- This it is and nothing more.'"
- Shh!

231
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.322
What if they call?

232
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.199
They're not gonna.

233
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.159
What if they do?

234
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.786
Tell them we were just
doing homework,

235
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.454
and then we, like,
just left for home.

236
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.580
Okay? Say, "For home."

237
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.083
What did I say?!

238
00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.294
STUART:
One, two! One, one, two!

239
00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.338
One, one, two!

240
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.548
One, two!

241
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.049
You got to suck the air
out of your teeth.

242
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.342
It's a thing, right?

243
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.302
One, two! One, one, two!

244
00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.638
What you got going on
this weekend?

245
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.474
Angie's got a soccer thing
all day Saturday. You?

246
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.310
My church is having
a pancake lunch on Sunday.

247
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.645
You can both come.

248
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.938
Some of us get
a little freaked out

249
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.566
when people start
speaking in tongues.

250
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.153
(school bell rings)

251
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.696
Okay. Exactly.

252
00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.949
And so, my dad's not gonna call
'cause he's going to the, um...

253
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.161
(engine idling)

254
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.168
KATHERINE:
What are we doing? (laughs)

255
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.836
ANGELA: "What are we doing?"
This is your idea.

256
00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.963
KATHERINE:
You know something's out there.

257
00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.175
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

258
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.597
ANGELA:
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

259
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.432
KATHERINE: We light the candle
and hold the pendulum

260
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.726
and ask the spirit
yes-or-no questions

261
00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.187
about angels and demons
and devils

262
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.272
and pastors and saints.

263
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.191
ANGELA: And lions and tigers
and bears and...

264
00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.734
- KATHERINE: Shut up.
- (laughing)

265
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.277
Watch this.

266
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.696
Uh... (laughing): Okay,
what are you, insane?

267
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.364
- Whoo!
- Excuse you.

268
00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.949
(laughter)

269
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.868
You can light your own candles.

270
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.120
Get your sticks
and rub them together

271
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.082
like you did at camp.

272
00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.170
(birds chirping)

273
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.552
- Boo! (laughs)
- (screams)

274
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.222
DAD:
It's been a while. Yeah.

275
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.640
- All right, here we go.
- MOM: Nice and tall. Whoo!

276
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.100
- DAD: Come on, buddy.
- VICTOR: That's not bad.

277
00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.351
- DAD: Let's smile.
- VICTOR: Okay.

278
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.228
That's not bad at all.
Ah, there we go.

279
00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.854
MOM:
I like this, but I also think

280
00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.231
have the kids in the middle...

281
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.982
Do you want...
Do you want her and then him?

282
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.234
Let's get you guys
closer together.

283
00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.735
Can we get...
get a little closer?

284
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.028
- MOM: Come on, honey.
- DAD: Come on.

285
00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.321
VICTOR:
Get you right in the front.

286
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.281
- Hang you upside down?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.324
(laughing)

288
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.867
VICTOR:
Where's Dad? Everybody!

289
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.077
- Come right here.
- Come back.

290
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.079
- DAD: Smile.
- I am!

291
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.288
- (crying)
- (camera clicks)

292
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.581
DAD: I'm gonna teach you
how to be a man.

293
00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.749
I-I'm getting good stuff.

294
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.251
- (laughing)
- (snarling)

295
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.710
I'm gonna count to three.

296
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.420
One, two...

297
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.631
(yelling)

298
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.967
(birds cawing)

299
00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.301
(girls laughing)

300
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.262
KATHERINE:
You light a candle

301
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:34.058
and just clear your mind.

302
00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.187
Just start speaking
what she says to you.

303
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.071
Okay.

304
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.907
(raspy):
Angela.

305
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.784
- Angela.
- (raspy): Katherine.

306
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.954

- That's so creepy.

307

308
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.673

309
00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.075
(crickets chirping)

310
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.720
Come on.

311
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.681
(sighs)

312
00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.230
(door closes)

313
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.399
Ange?

314
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.027
You asleep?

315
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.040
Ange?

316
00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.174
ANGELA (recorded):
Hey, it's Angela.

317
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.968
I don't check this, so text me.

318
00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.470
Bye.

319

MIRANDA:
Hello?

321
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.110
VICTOR:
Hi. Hey. This is, um...

322
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.653
This is Victor Fielding,
Angela's dad.

323
00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.738
She said she was coming over
to Katherine's house

324
00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.824
to do homework this afternoon.

325
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.742
- I was just... was looking...
- MIRANDA (over phone): No.

326
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.494
- Are they still...
- Uh, Katherine told me

327
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:02.205
she was going over to study
at Deshannah's house.

328
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.540
I'm sorry, who is that?

329
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.208
Deshannah Young?
A friend of Katherine's.

330
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.085
She told me they were gonna go
over there and study.

331
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.461
- They're there?
- Maybe Angela's with them?

332
00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.505
The girls are at
Deshannah's house?

333
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.965
Yeah, you know, maybe
they're studying together.

334
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.591
Let me give her mom a try.

335
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.261
Okay, give me a call back
if you... if you don't mind.

336
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.264
- Yep.
- Thanks.

337
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.313
Hold on just a second.
It's Deshannah.

338
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.606
Do you know where
they were going?

339
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.859
DESHANNAH: I don't know
where they were going.

340
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.110
They just wanted me to say

341
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.903
they were here
in case anyone called.

342
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:37.282
Well, did you see them together
or did you see where they went?

343
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.284
This is, uh... this is Tony.
I'm Katherine's father.

344
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.495
Did-did you see them
get in a car with anybody?

345
00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.289
DESHANNAH:
They were just walking.

346
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.625
Walked away,
walked into the woods.

347
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.461
TONY:
I'm getting my coat.

All right, they're on
their way. See, that's them.

Angela and Katherine.

They depart campus after school.

They proceed at 2:45.

Somebody is living out there.
There are people out there.

MIRANDA: There's got to be
somebody that knows.

KONIK: I understand. There is
a transient community...

- TONY: Transient community?
- KONIK: Yes.

389
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.342
Is that what you call
a bunch of fucking bums?

390
00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:44.427
KONIK: So far,
the interviews with them

391
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.095
do not indicate
any connection...

392
00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.639
That's shocking. Shocking.

393
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.349
Is there anything else going on
with your daughter...

394
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.476
KONIK: We are looking
into every option.

395
00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.061
That we should know?

396
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.312
Pardon me?

VICTOR:
That you haven't told us?

398
00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.398
To be honest with you, sir,
I didn't even know

399
00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:58.900
our daughter was friends
with your daughter.

400
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.610
Katherine is a free spirit.
She is a popular kid.

401
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.153
- She is well liked.
- If I did, this would not be

402
00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.988
the first time we were meeting,
I promise you that.

403
00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.657
She is a-a youth group leader
at our church, ma'am.

404
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.659
VICTOR: No, 'cause...
'cause what I'm saying is,

405
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.413
my daughter and I are...
we're connected, close.

406
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.249
She doesn't do
all the activities

407
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.042
like the free spirit,
so I don't know.

408
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.752
I'm just saying sometimes
there's things we don't know.

409
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.212
TONY: Well, I don't know you,
you know?

410
00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:20.672
VICTOR:
Sometimes there's things,

411
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.340
as parents, we don't know.

412
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.883
- We don't know you!
- What you know about me

413
00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.677
is that the only thing
that's ever mattered

414
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.387
is protecting my kid.
That's what you know about me.

415
00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:28.680
Well, then, where are they?

416
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.348
- (Tony shouts)
- Okay.

417
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.891
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

418
00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.518
- MIRANDA: Where could they be?
- Hey. Listen up. Okay.

419
00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.061
MIRANDA: That's what
we need to worry about.

420
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.355
I know you're all upset.

421
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.481
(Tony groans)

422
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:40.733
I know you're all stressed.

423
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.694
The good news is
they left together.

424
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:46.281
Statistically, it's likely your
girls are just out being girls.

425
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:50.702
We need to recognize that
we all have a common goal here.

426
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.539
Let's get your girls home safe.

427
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:57.126
Let's do that. Right now.

questions, all right?

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.736
Asking if you've seen anything,

436
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.654
trying to figure out
who might have seen something.

437
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.406
You don't know nothing.

438
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.866
We weren't looking or nothing.

Kids that don't want to be
told what to do.

475
00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:11.592
Kids that don't want to go home,

476

even though they got good ones.

477
00:25:14.555 --> 00:25:16.472
Run off looking for things.

No, no, that's not...
that's not my kid.

she don't find her mama.

something else instead.

Hey, Victor.
Oh, good, you're home.

491
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.608
This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.

492

This is a good thing.

No, she's not here.
This is Dr. Beehibe.

497

- Is Angela here?
- No, no, she's not here.

498
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:06.207
- This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.
- We're doing a blessing.

499
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.458
We are bringing her back.

500
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:08.960
We want to bring her back protected.

501
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.628
- This is... This is okay.
- We want her to come back.

502
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.004
STUART: She's doing
a blessing on her room.

503
00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.298
That-that's all,
just-just to keep Angela safe.

504
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.967
I need you to get everybody out.

505
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:17.468
STUART:
Uh, ladies, come on.

506
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.220
- VICTOR: Faster, Stu.
- Come on.

507
00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.014
Come on.

508
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:25.017
Hey, pal, I was just
trying to help.

509
00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:27.187
- Get the fuck out.
- Okay.

510
00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:54.339
- (door slams)
- (thunder rumbling)

511
00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:04.057
STUART:
When my sister was sick...

512
00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:07.227
and we did all we could...

513
00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.938
for her to find relief,

514
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:13.858
she had to go outside

515
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.652
of her belief system,
outside of my beliefs.

516
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.404
(sighs softly)

517
00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:19.780
We're your neighbors.

518
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:22.533
And we just want
to be there for you

519
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.120
and-and do anything that we can.

520
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:27.705
(sharp inhale)

521
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.790
(thunder rumbling)

522
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:32.376
She doesn't have her raincoat.

523
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.004
FARMER'S SON:
Dad, Dad, she has the fever!

524
00:28:35.005 --> 00:28:36.756
I just come out
and she went down!

525
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:39.008
Hurry and get the kit.
I'll call Dr. Bethero.

526
00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:41.552
The tub and the mat.
Bring me the whole thing.

527
00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.763
- Okay. Okay.
- Hurry and get the kit.

528
00:28:43.764 --> 00:28:45.514
- Bring a blanket.
- Yeah.

529
00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:46.682
Bring a blanket, too.

530
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:48.060
Blanket.

531
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.990
(goats bleating)

532
00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:22.761
(frantic rummaging)

533
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:28.308
(animallike squealing)

534
00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:44.449
Dad?

535
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.701
Where are we?

536
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:48.536
Dad!

537
00:29:48.537 --> 00:29:50.997
(horn honking)

538
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:54.459
- (tires squealing)
- (horns honking)

539
00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.135
Hey. (panting)

540
00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:05.678
- Where is she? She's this way?
- She's just admitted.

541
00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:07.014
Come here.

542
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:11.142
TONY: You are not...
You are not in trouble.

543
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.643
MIRANDA:
You're not in trouble.

544
00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.353
- TONY: You're not grounded.
- MIRANDA: Mommy and Daddy

545
00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:16.314
- aren't gonna be mad at you.
- But you have to...

546
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.607
Angela.

547
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:19.985
Okay, okay, sir...

548
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.990
VICTOR (crying):
Hey.

549
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:30.911
- Are you hurt?
- Are you mad at me?

550
00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:33.706
No, I'm not mad at you. Uh-uh.

551
00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:36.042
I'm so sorry.
I lost track of time.

552
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.169
- Angela.
- Don't worry about that.

553
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.671
Can you tell your dad
how long you've been gone?

554
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.131
How long?

555
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:43.716
Why do you keep asking me that?

556
00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:45.092
- It's important.
- Why do you keep asking?

557
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:46.469
It sounds like she wants to...

558
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.012
Angela.

559
00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:50.389
Just tell your father
the same thing you told me.

560
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.349
How long do you think
you were gone?

561
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.603
I don't know, uh...

562
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:59.191
A few hours?

563
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:05.530
No.

564
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:10.035
Baby, you've been gone
three days.

565
00:31:14.748 --> 00:31:16.707
(quiet chatter)

566
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.042
DR. LOWELL:
I'm Dr. Lowell.

567
00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:20.044
It's very nice
to meet you today.

568
00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:22.463
Can you tell us anything
that you remember?

569
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.923
We were just walking.

570
00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:25.216
And then it started raining.

571
00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:28.552
And we went into
that barn and...

572
00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.929
That's all I remember.

573
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.222
She don't remember
too much, um...

574
00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:33.099
DR. LOWELL:
Okay. Okay.

575
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.267
But, um, her-her feet.

576
00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:37.228
Her feet look really bad.

577
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:39.980
DR. JAFFREE: Well, in order for
us to kind of get a better idea

578
00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:43.067
of what has been going on
over the past three days,

579
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:44.568
we need to examine you.

580
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.237
DR. LOWELL: Sometimes when
children deal with either

581
00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:48.489
significant psychological
or traumatic injuries,

582
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.407
they can maybe have some
retrograde amnesia

583
00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.827
where they may not remember
events that might have happened.

584
00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:54.411
DR. TAJ:
How are you feeling, honey?

585
00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.538
Are you in pain?

586
00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:57.081
I don't know.

587
00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.833
- DR. JAFFREE: Okay. Very good.
- (camera clicking)

588
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:00.751
DR. LOWELL: Has she ever been
treated with hypnosis? -No.

589
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.753
- Ah.
- Anybody in the family have

590
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.421
any, um, psychiatric illnesses?

591
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.257
No. She's healthy.
She's real strong.

592
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:07.925
DR. JAFFREE: So I'm gonna
take down the buttons, okay?

593
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.760
DR. CARR: Dad, if you have any
questions at any time, just...

594
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.262
DR. LOWELL: Does she have
access to any medications

595
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:12.596
- around the house?
- VICTOR: No.

596
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.432
- (camera clicks)
- Okay.

597
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:17.601
- What's going on here?
- TONY: Hi, honey.

598
00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.270
Um, this is Dr. Lowell.

599
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.938
- Hi, ma'am. I'm Dr. Lowell.
- Why didn't you wait on me?

600
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.439
DR. CARR:
Feel free to stand next to her.

601
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.191
DR. JAFFREE: Okay,
we'll start again from the top.

602
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.818
I'm just gonna touch you
right here, okay? Gonna just...

603
00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:28.070
She's not complaining of any
pain, but she's disoriented,

604
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:30.948
which can happen
with head trauma.

605
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.408
We're just gonna
take a look over here.

606
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:34.118
DR. JAFFREE: Okay, very good.
Thank you, Joe.

607
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.954
Now we have to do one last
portion of the exam.

608
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.372
It's a little bit uncomfortable.

609
00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:40.291
These here,
these are called stirrups.

610
00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:41.750
And, Dad, if you're okay, this
is the more sensitive part.

611
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.460
Just gonna change my gloves.

612
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:44.962
Hey, babe, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna see you

613
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.255
in a few minutes, okay?

614
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:47.756
If at any point
you feel discomfort,

615
00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:49.091
please let me know.

616
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.467
You're gonna feel
a little bit of cold jelly

617
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:53.804
and lots of pressure,
but no pain, okay?

618
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.472
Just a little bit
of pressure, okay?

619
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:58.767
I'm just gonna be
taking a few samples.

620
00:32:58.768 --> 00:32:59.977
DR. JAFFREE:
I'm looking to see

621
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:01.395
if your hymenal ring
is still intact.

622
00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:04.648
Sometimes when people are
touched inappropriately,

623
00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.234
those things can be damaged.

624
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:09.195
- DR. TAJ: We are all done.
- DR. JAFFREE: Here you go.

625
00:33:09.196 --> 00:33:11.323
Yeah, you got it. Good girl.

626
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.203
KONIK: We conducted
rigorous physical exams

627
00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:18.787
and cognitive interviews.

628
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:20.206
There's no sign of distress,

629
00:33:20.207 --> 00:33:22.416
no evidence of sexual assault.

630
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.419
Toxicology is normal.
Their stories are consistent.

631
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.838
They both say they just went
to hang out in the woods,

632
00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:30.174
they got lost on the way back,
and they were afraid

633
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:32.176
of getting in trouble,
so they just kept walking.

634
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.011
Three days later, they end up
30 miles down the road

635
00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:36.847
in some farmer's barn with no
concept of time having passed.

636
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.307
They met someone out there.

637
00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:39.683
There has to be something
they're not telling us.

638
00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:41.310
I don't understand,
no concept of time...

639
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:42.561
KONIK: Our heads go
to complicated places

640
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.188
when we're faced
with undefined anomalies.

641
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:45.773
KATHERINE:
Mommy.

642
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.358
KONIK: But you guys should
consider yourselves lucky.

643
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.276
Sure, girls keep secrets,

644
00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:52.530
but every test is clean.

645
00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:55.532
Everything is perfectly normal.

646
00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.368
Can I go home now?

647
00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:59.245

Normally, I hate it

649
00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.581
when someone I know
turns up here,

650
00:34:02.582 --> 00:34:06.168
but I got to tell you,
I just about died of happiness

651
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:08.671

on the intake board.

652
00:34:08.672 --> 00:34:11.131
- (baby crying loudly)
- Now, don't you worry.

653
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:15.594
Gonna have you out of here
in no time at all.

654
00:34:15.595 --> 00:34:18.889
I had been praying for you
night and day.

VICTOR:
Okay.

659
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.119
You know that I love you, right?

660
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:42.747
You know
you can tell me anything.

661
00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:46.583
What were you and Katherine
doing out there in those woods?

662
00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.876
I don't know.

663
00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:50.421
I wanted to find the...

(sighs)

665
00:34:53.883 --> 00:34:56.553
I wanted to talk to Mama.

666
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.431
Sometimes I hear her voice.

667
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.433
She talks to me.

668
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:05.687
Yeah, baby, sometimes
I hear her voice, too.

669
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.356
- It doesn't mean...
- I wanted Katherine to hear.

670
00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.942
She reads the Bible.
She goes to church.

671
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.777
I wanted to tell if I was crazy.

672
00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.448
- If it was really her.
- You're not crazy.

673
00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.204
You light a candle.

Clear your mind.

- (distorted screams)
- Drip, drop...

677
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:34.298
You stand in the trees holding
something that you love

678
00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:36.633
that gives you connection.

679
00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:40.095
You just start speaking
what the spirit says to you.

680
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:42.557
What did the spirit say to you?

(distorted laughter)

682
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.822
She wasn't there.

683
00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.658
No one was.

684
00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:04.454
We took the scarf.
That was my connection.

685
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:08.375
Okay.

00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:17.509
Leave me alone now.
