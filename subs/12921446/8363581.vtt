Shut up, okay?

TONY:
Do not park... Oh, my gosh.

- VICTOR: One sec.

188
00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:38.409

That's a bus lane. -One second.

189
00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:40.411
-Come on! -HANNAH: Katherine's
wearing flip-flops to school?

190
00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:41.599
Give that back!

191
00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:43.183
- Hey, that's mine!
- MIRANDA: Flip-flops?

192
00:11:43.207 --> 00:11:44.580
Katherine, what happened
to your new shoes?

193
00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:46.087
Tyler colored on them
with Magic Marker.

194
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:47.539
TONY:
Not today, guys. Not today.

195
00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.409
-You said they gave you
blisters. -Shut up!

196
00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:51.356
-Don't tell your sister
to shut up. -Okay, I got to go.

197
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.292
-Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. -She's got
something on her lips. Hey.

198
00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:54.931
HANNAH: You're stepping on my
backpack! Hands off! Get off!

199
00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:56.361
- TONY: I want it off.
- You're embarrassing me.

200
00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:57.725
-You call us when you get
to Deshannah's. -I will.

201
00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.320
- Promise me. Promise me.
- I will!

202
00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:01.421
- Promise.

203
00:12:01.456 --> 00:12:03.203
-I shouldn't have snapped
at you. -Can't park there!

204
00:12:03.227 --> 00:12:04.897
- One sec. One second.
- That...

205
00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:07.361
- It's a fire lane.
- One sec. Hey.

206
00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:09.396
It's just, you know,
Mom's stuff is...

207
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:11.398
It's precious.

208
00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:15.369
You be home by dinner,
all right?

209
00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:20.176
- Thank you! (laughs)

- Good morning, Mr. Fielding.

215
00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.186
Morning, Katherine.

"For the rare and radiant maiden

217
00:12:32.157 --> 00:12:33.552

name Lenore..."

218
00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:34.905
(Angela and Deshannah
whispering indistinctly)

219
00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:36.104
"Nameless here for evermore..."

220
00:12:36.128 --> 00:12:37.622
DESHANNAH:
A séance?

221
00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:39.140
Just tell them that we're
doing homework, all right?

222
00:12:39.164 --> 00:12:40.757
My dad agreed,
so don't worry about it.

223
00:12:40.792 --> 00:12:42.968
-I don't think he's gonna
call Miranda. -STUDENT: Shh!

224
00:12:43.003 --> 00:12:44.431
(whispering continues
indistinctly)

225
00:12:44.466 --> 00:12:46.532
Quiet!

226
00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:48.006
What if he calls?

227
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:49.348
(over TV): "to still
the beating of my heart,

228
00:12:49.372 --> 00:12:51.174
"I stood repeating
"Tis some visitor

229
00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:53.077
entreating entrance
at my chamber door... '"

-Shh!

233
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.184
What if they call?

234
00:13:01.219 --> 00:13:03.054
They're not gonna.

235
00:13:03.089 --> 00:13:05.188
What if they do?

236
00:13:05.223 --> 00:13:06.662
Tell them we were just
doing homework,

237
00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.488
and then we, like,
just left for home.

238
00:13:08.523 --> 00:13:09.588
Okay? Say, "For home."

239
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:12.129
What did I say?!

240
00:13:12.164 --> 00:13:15.132
STUART:
One, two! One, one, two!

241
00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.365
One, one, two!

242
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.597
One, two!

243
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:20.115
You got to suck the air
out of your teeth.

244
00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:21.171
It's a thing, right?

245
00:13:21.206 --> 00:13:23.338
One, two! One, one, two!

246
00:13:23.373 --> 00:13:25.637
What you got going on
this weekend?

247
00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:28.508
Angie's got a soccer thing
all day Saturday. You?

248
00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:31.181
My church is having
a pancake lunch on Sunday.

249
00:13:31.216 --> 00:13:32.479
You can both come.

250
00:13:32.514 --> 00:13:34.118
Some of us get
a little freaked out

251
00:13:34.153 --> 00:13:35.633
when people start
speaking in tongues.

252
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:39.222
(school bell rings)

253
00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:41.785
Okay. Exactly.

254
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.964
So, my dad's not gonna call
'cause he's going to the, um...

255
00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:47.230
(engine idling)

256
00:13:53.601 --> 00:13:55.271
KATHERINE:
What are we doing? (laughs)

257
00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:56.712
ANGELA: "What are we doing?"
This is your idea.

258
00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.978
KATHERINE:
You know something's out there.

259
00:13:59.013 --> 00:14:01.244
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

260
00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:07.679
ANGELA:
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

261
00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:09.494
KATHERINE: We light the candle
and hold the pendulum

262
00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:11.584
and ask the spirit
yes-or-no questions

263
00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:14.224
about angels and demons
and devils

264
00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:16.325
and pastors and saints.

265
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.261
ANGELA: And lions and tigers
and bears and...

266
00:14:18.296 --> 00:14:19.757
- KATHERINE: Shut up.
- (laughing)

267
00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.330
Watch this.

268
00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:23.761
Uh... (laughing): Okay,
what are you, insane?

269
00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.400
- Whoo!
- Excuse you.

270
00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:26.973
(laughter)

271
00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:28.700
You can light your own candles.

272
00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:31.175
Get your sticks
and rub them together

273
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.144
like you did at camp.

274
00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:38.215
(birds chirping)

275
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.618
- Boo! (laughs)
- (screams)

276
00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:49.160
DAD:
It's been a while. Yeah.

277
00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:50.700
- Here we go.
- MOM: Nice and tall. Whoo!

278
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.174
- DAD: Come on, buddy.
- VICTOR: That's not bad.

279
00:14:52.198 --> 00:14:53.472
- DAD: Let's smile.
- VICTOR: Okay.

280
00:14:53.496 --> 00:14:55.265
That's not bad at all.
Ah, there we go.

281
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.827
MOM:
I like this, but I also think

282
00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.301
have the kids in the middle...

283
00:14:58.336 --> 00:15:00.017
Do you want...
Do you want her and then him?

284
00:15:00.041 --> 00:15:01.117
Let's get you guys
closer together.

285
00:15:01.141 --> 00:15:02.602
Can we get a little closer?

286
00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:04.142
- MOM: Come on, honey.
- DAD: Come on.

287
00:15:04.177 --> 00:15:05.385
VICTOR:
Get you right in the front.

288
00:15:05.409 --> 00:15:07.145
- Hang you upside down?
- Yeah.

289
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.410
(laughing)

290
00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:09.873
VICTOR:
Where's Dad? Everybody!

291
00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.149
- Come right here.
- Come back.

292
00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:13.118
- DAD: Smile.
- I am!

293
00:15:13.153 --> 00:15:14.383
- (crying)
- (camera clicks)

294
00:15:14.418 --> 00:15:15.384
DAD: I'm gonna teach you
how to be a man.

295
00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:16.781
I-I'm getting good stuff.

296
00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:18.288
- (laughing)
- (snarling)

297
00:15:18.323 --> 00:15:19.718
I'm gonna count to three.

298
00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.456
One, two...

299
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:22.688
(yelling)

300
00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:25.999

301
00:15:26.034 --> 00:15:27.363
(girls laughing)

302
00:15:27.398 --> 00:15:29.266
KATHERINE:
You light a candle

303
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:33.072
and just clear your mind.

304
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.241
Just start speaking
what she says to you.

305
00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:46.118
Okay.

306
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.913

Angela.

307
00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:51.585
- Angela.
- (raspy): Katherine.

308
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.027

(crickets chirping)

312
00:16:50.646 --> 00:16:52.745
Come on.

313
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.747
(sighs)

314
00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:01.292
(door closes)

315
00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:04.460
Ange?

316
00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:07.100
You asleep?

317
00:17:18.278 --> 00:17:20.113
Ange?

318
00:17:28.651 --> 00:17:30.189
ANGELA (recorded):
Hey, it's Angela.

319
00:17:30.224 --> 00:17:32.015
I don't check this, so text me.

320
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.522
Bye.

VICTOR:
<i>Hi. Hey. This is, um...</i>

324
00:17:49.243 --> 00:17:50.737
This is Victor Fielding,
Angela's dad.

325
00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:52.618
She said she was coming over
to Katherine's house

326
00:17:52.642 --> 00:17:54.873
to do homework this afternoon.

327
00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.787
- I was just... was looking...
- MIRANDA (over phone):<i> No.</i>

328
00:17:56.811 --> 00:17:58.679
- Are they still...
- <i>Uh, Katherine told me</i>

329
00:17:58.714 --> 00:18:01.253
<i>she was going over to study
at Deshannah's house.</i>

330
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:02.650
I'm sorry, who is that?

331
00:18:02.685 --> 00:18:04.520
<i>Deshannah Young?
A friend of Katherine's.</i>

332
00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:06.060
<i>She told me they were gonna
go over there and study.</i>

333
00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:07.534
- They're there?
- <i>Maybe Angela's with them?</i>

334
00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:09.525
The girls are at
Deshannah's house?

335
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.999
<i>Yeah, you know, maybe
they're studying together.</i>

336
00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:12.627
<i>Let me give her mom a try.</i>

337
00:18:12.662 --> 00:18:15.300
Okay, give me a call back
if you... if you don't mind.

338
00:18:15.335 --> 00:18:17.302
- <i>Yep.</i>
- Thanks.

339
00:18:22.804 --> 00:18:25.376
Hold on just a second.
It's Deshannah.

340
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:27.642
Do you know where
they were going?

341
00:18:27.677 --> 00:18:29.677
DESHANNAH: <i>I don't know
where they were going.</i>

342
00:18:29.712 --> 00:18:31.349
<i>They just wanted me to say</i>

343
00:18:31.384 --> 00:18:33.142
<i>they were here
in case anyone called.</i>

344
00:18:33.177 --> 00:18:36.112
Well, did you see them together
or did you see where they went?

345
00:18:36.147 --> 00:18:38.356
This is, uh... this is Tony.
I'm Katherine's father.

346
00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:41.557
Did-did you see them
get in a car with anybody?

347
00:18:41.592 --> 00:18:43.328
DESHANNAH:
<i>They were just walking.</i>

348
00:18:43.363 --> 00:18:45.660
<i>Walked away,
walked into the woods.</i>

All right, they're on

Angela and Katherine.

They depart campus after school.

They proceed at 2:45.

Somebody is living out there.
There are people out there.

somebody that knows.

a transient community...

- TONY: Transient community?
- KONIK: Yes.

391

Is that what you call
a bunch of fucking bums?

392
00:21:41.574 --> 00:21:43.475
KONIK: So far,
the interviews with them

do not indicate
any connection...

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.006
That's shocking. Shocking.

395
00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:48.689
Is there anything else going on
with your daughter...

396
00:21:48.713 --> 00:21:50.548
KONIK: We are looking
into every option.

397
00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:52.110
That we should know?

398
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.419
Pardon me?

VICTOR:
That you haven't told us?

400
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.532
To be honest with you, sir,
I didn't even know

401
00:21:56.556 --> 00:21:58.094
our daughter was friends
with your daughter.

402
00:21:58.118 --> 00:21:59.832
Katherine is a free spirit.
She is a popular kid.

403
00:21:59.856 --> 00:22:01.438
- She is well liked.
- If I did, this would not be

404
00:22:01.462 --> 00:22:03.198
the first time we were meeting,
I promise you that.

405
00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:04.936
She is a youth group leader
at our church, ma'am.

406
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.740
VICTOR: No, 'cause...
'cause what I'm saying is,

407
00:22:06.764 --> 00:22:11.437
my daughter and I are...
we're connected, close.

408
00:22:11.472 --> 00:22:13.098
She doesn't do
all the activities

409
00:22:13.133 --> 00:22:15.100
like the free spirit,
so I don't know.

410
00:22:15.135 --> 00:22:16.816
I'm just saying sometimes
there's things we don't know.

411
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.081
TONY: Well, I don't know you,
you know?

VICTOR:
Sometimes there's things,

413
00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:21.172
as parents, we don't know.

414
00:22:21.207 --> 00:22:22.954
- We don't know you!
- What you know about me

415
00:22:22.978 --> 00:22:24.747
is that the only thing
that's ever mattered

416
00:22:24.782 --> 00:22:26.430
is protecting my kid.
That's what you know about me.

417
00:22:26.454 --> 00:22:27.684
Well, then, where are they?

418
00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:29.378
- (Tony shouts)
- Okay.

419
00:22:29.413 --> 00:22:30.984
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

420
00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:32.667
- MIRANDA: Where could they be?
- Hey. Listen up. Okay.

421
00:22:32.691 --> 00:22:34.130
MIRANDA: That's what
we need to worry about.

422
00:22:34.154 --> 00:22:36.385
I know you're all upset.

423
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.529

424
00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:39.795
I know you're all stressed.

425
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.929
The good news is
they left together.

426
00:22:41.964 --> 00:22:45.328
Statistically, it's likely your
girls are just out being girls.

427
00:22:45.363 --> 00:22:49.739
We need to recognize that
we all have a common goal here.

428
00:22:49.774 --> 00:22:52.577
Let's get your girls home safe.

429
00:22:53.514 --> 00:22:56.174
Let's do that. Right now.

questions, all right?

00:23:21.938 --> 00:23:23.773
Asking if you've seen anything,

438
00:23:23.808 --> 00:23:25.687
trying to figure out
who might have seen something.

439
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:27.480
You don't know nothing.

440
00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:28.910
We weren't looking or nothing.

Kids that don't want to be
told what to do.

Kids that don't want to go home,

even though they got good ones.

479

that's not my kid.

Hey, Victor.
Oh, good, you're home.

494
00:26:47.143 --> 00:26:49.638
This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.

This is a good thing.

No, she's not here.
This is Dr. Beehibe.

500

- No, no, she's not here.

501
00:27:04.061 --> 00:27:05.027
- This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.
- We're doing a blessing.

502
00:27:05.062 --> 00:27:06.358
We are bringing her back.

503
00:27:06.393 --> 00:27:08.030
We want to bring her back
protected.

504
00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:09.900
- This is okay.
- We want her to come back.

505
00:27:09.935 --> 00:27:11.407
STUART: She's doing
a blessing on her room.

506
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:13.101
That's all,
just to keep Angela safe.

507
00:27:13.136 --> 00:27:15.004
I need you to get everybody out.

508
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.335
STUART:
Uh, ladies, come on.

509
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.271
- VICTOR: Faster, Stu.
- Come on.

510
00:27:18.306 --> 00:27:20.075
Come on.

511
00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:24.079
Hey, pal, I was just
trying to help.

512
00:27:24.114 --> 00:27:26.246
- Get the fuck out.
- Okay.

513
00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:53.372
- (door slams)
- (thunder rumbling)

514
00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:03.118
STUART:
<i>When my sister was sick...</i>

515
00:28:04.055 --> 00:28:06.286
and we did all we could...

516
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:09.993
for her to find relief,

517
00:28:10.028 --> 00:28:12.897
she had to go outside

518
00:28:12.932 --> 00:28:15.658
of her belief system,
outside of my beliefs.

519
00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:17.462
(sighs softly)

520
00:28:17.497 --> 00:28:18.804
We're your neighbors.

521
00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:21.598
And we just want
to be there for you

522
00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:24.172
and do anything that we can.

523
00:28:25.472 --> 00:28:26.779

524
00:28:26.814 --> 00:28:28.814
(thunder rumbling)

525
00:28:28.849 --> 00:28:31.410
She doesn't have her raincoat.

526
00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:34.050
FARMER'S SON:
Dad, Dad, she has the fever!

527
00:28:34.085 --> 00:28:35.612
I just come out
and she went down!

528
00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:38.054
Hurry and get the kit.
I'll call Dr. Bethero.

529
00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:40.419
The tub and the mat.
Bring me the whole thing.

530
00:28:40.454 --> 00:28:42.828
- Okay. Okay.
- Hurry and get the kit.

531
00:28:42.863 --> 00:28:44.522
- Bring a blanket.
- Yeah.

532
00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:45.688
Bring a blanket, too.

533
00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:47.129
Blanket.

534
00:28:58.802 --> 00:29:01.044
(goats bleating)

535
00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:21.801
(frantic rummaging)

536
00:29:25.136 --> 00:29:27.367
(animallike squealing)

537
00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.515
Dad?

538
00:29:44.518 --> 00:29:45.748
Where are we?

539
00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:47.552
Dad!

540
00:29:47.587 --> 00:29:50.060
(horn honking)

541
00:29:50.095 --> 00:29:53.492
- (tires squealing)
- (horns honking)

542
00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:03.238
Hey. (panting)

543
00:30:03.273 --> 00:30:04.745
- Where is she? She's this way?
- She's just admitted.

544
00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.076
Come here.

545
00:30:08.344 --> 00:30:10.179
TONY: You are not...
You are not in trouble.

546
00:30:10.214 --> 00:30:11.741
MIRANDA:
You're not in trouble.

547
00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:13.490
- TONY: You're not grounded.
- MIRANDA: Mommy and Daddy

548
00:30:13.514 --> 00:30:15.474
- aren't gonna be mad at you.
- But you have to...

549
00:30:16.451 --> 00:30:17.648
Angela.

550
00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:19.023
Okay, okay, sir...

551
00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:24.028
VICTOR (crying):
Hey.

552
00:30:27.363 --> 00:30:29.968
- Are you hurt?
- Are you mad at me?

553
00:30:30.003 --> 00:30:32.564
No, I'm not mad at you. Uh-uh.

554
00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:35.072
I'm so sorry.
I lost track of time.

555
00:30:35.107 --> 00:30:37.239
- Angela.
- Don't worry about that.

556
00:30:37.274 --> 00:30:39.703
Can you tell your dad
how long you've been gone?

557
00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:41.177
How long?

558
00:30:41.212 --> 00:30:42.574
Why do you keep asking me that?

559
00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:44.158
- It's important.
- Why do you keep asking?

560
00:30:44.182 --> 00:30:45.511
It sounds like she wants to...

561
00:30:45.546 --> 00:30:46.875
Angela.

562
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.449
Just tell your father
the same thing you told me.

563
00:30:49.484 --> 00:30:51.220
How long do you think
you were gone?

564
00:30:51.255 --> 00:30:53.651
I don't know, uh...

565
00:30:56.656 --> 00:30:58.227
A few hours?

566
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.596
No.

567
00:31:06.204 --> 00:31:09.106
Baby, you've been gone
three days.

568
00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.574
(quiet chatter)

569
00:31:15.609 --> 00:31:17.114
DR. LOWELL:
I'm Dr. Lowell.

570
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:19.116
It's very nice
to meet you today.

571
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:21.316
Can you tell us anything
that you remember?

572
00:31:21.351 --> 00:31:22.988
We were just walking.

573
00:31:23.023 --> 00:31:24.253
And then it started raining.

574
00:31:24.288 --> 00:31:27.355
And we went into
that barn and...

575
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.994
That's all I remember.

576
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:30.270
She don't remember
too much, um...

577
00:31:30.294 --> 00:31:32.162
DR. LOWELL:
Okay. Okay.

578
00:31:32.197 --> 00:31:34.329
But, um, her-her feet.

579
00:31:34.364 --> 00:31:36.133
<i>Her feet look really bad.</i>

580
00:31:36.168 --> 00:31:38.828
DR. JAFFREE: Well, in order for
us to kind of get a better idea

581
00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:42.106
of what has been going on
over the past three days,

582
00:31:42.141 --> 00:31:43.635
we need to examine you.

583
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.318
DR. LOWELL: Sometimes when
children deal with either

584
00:31:45.342 --> 00:31:47.540
significant psychological
or traumatic injuries,

585
00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:49.443
they can maybe have some
retrograde amnesia

586
00:31:49.478 --> 00:31:50.983
<i>where they may not remember</i>

587
00:31:51.018 --> 00:31:52.325
<i>events that might have happened.</i>

588
00:31:52.349 --> 00:31:53.216
DR. TAJ:
<i>How are you feeling, honey?</i>

589
00:31:53.251 --> 00:31:54.580
<i>Are you in pain?</i>

590
00:31:54.615 --> 00:31:55.911
I don't know.

591
00:31:55.946 --> 00:31:57.946
- DR. JAFFREE: Okay. Very good.
- (camera clicking)

592
00:31:57.981 --> 00:31:59.629
-DR. LOWELL: <i>Has she ever been
treated with hypnosis? -No.</i>

593
00:31:59.653 --> 00:32:01.554
- Ah.
- Anybody in the family have

594
00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:03.424
any, um, psychiatric illnesses?

595
00:32:03.459 --> 00:32:05.294
No. She's healthy.
She's real strong.

596
00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:07.043
DR. JAFFREE: So I'm gonna
take down the buttons, okay?

597
00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:08.836
DR. CARR: Dad, if you have any
questions at any time, just...

598
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.409
DR. LOWELL: <i>Does she have
access to any medications</i>

599
00:32:10.433 --> 00:32:11.476
<i>- around the house?</i>
- VICTOR:<i> No.</i>

600
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.467
- (camera clicks)
- Okay.

601
00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:16.437
- What's going on here?
- TONY: Hi, honey.

602
00:32:16.472 --> 00:32:18.109
Um, this is Dr. Lowell.

603
00:32:18.144 --> 00:32:19.880
- Hi, ma'am. I'm Dr. Lowell.
- Why didn't you wait on me?

604
00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.607
DR. CARR: <i>Feel free
to stand next to her.</i>

605
00:32:21.642 --> 00:32:23.510
DR. JAFFREE: <i>We'll start
again from the top.</i>

606
00:32:23.545 --> 00:32:25.391
I'm just gonna touch you here.
Get a sample of hair, okay?

607
00:32:25.415 --> 00:32:27.129
She's not complaining of any
pain, but she's disoriented,

608
00:32:27.153 --> 00:32:29.978
<i>which can happen
with head trauma.</i>

609
00:32:30.013 --> 00:32:31.496
We're just gonna
take a look over here.

610
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.201
DR. JAFFREE: Okay, very good.
Thank you, Joe.

611
00:32:33.225 --> 00:32:35.951
Now we have to do one last
portion of the exam.

612
00:32:35.986 --> 00:32:37.425
It's a little bit uncomfortable.

613
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.130
These here,
these are called stirrups.

614
00:32:39.165 --> 00:32:40.802
And, Dad, if you're okay, this
is the more sensitive part.

615
00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:42.496
Just gonna change my gloves.

616
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:44.003
Hey, babe, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna see you

617
00:32:44.027 --> 00:32:45.334
in a few minutes, okay?

618
00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:46.769
If at any point
you feel discomfort,

619
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.172
please let me know.

620
00:32:48.207 --> 00:32:49.580
You're gonna feel
a little bit of cold jelly

621
00:32:49.604 --> 00:32:52.671
and lots of pressure,
but no pain, okay?

622
00:32:52.706 --> 00:32:54.541
Just a little bit
of pressure, okay?

623
00:32:54.576 --> 00:32:57.610
I'm just gonna be
taking a few samples.

624
00:32:57.645 --> 00:32:59.084
DR. JAFFREE:
<i>I'm looking to see</i>

625
00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:00.525
if your hymenal ring
is still intact.

626
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:03.451
Sometimes when people are
touched inappropriately,

627
00:33:03.486 --> 00:33:06.091
those things can be damaged.

628
00:33:06.126 --> 00:33:08.269
- DR. TAJ: We are all done.
- DR. JAFFREE:<i> Here you go.</i>

629
00:33:08.293 --> 00:33:10.392
Yeah, you got it. Good girl.

630
00:33:14.266 --> 00:33:16.233
KONIK: We conducted
rigorous physical exams

631
00:33:16.268 --> 00:33:17.795
and cognitive interviews.

632
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.236
There's no sign of distress,

633
00:33:19.271 --> 00:33:21.469
no evidence of sexual assault.

634
00:33:21.504 --> 00:33:24.439
Toxicology is normal.
Their stories are consistent.

635
00:33:24.474 --> 00:33:26.837
They both say they just went
to hang out in the woods,

636
00:33:26.872 --> 00:33:29.037
they got lost on the way back,
and they were afraid

637
00:33:29.072 --> 00:33:31.039
of getting in trouble,
so they just kept walking.

638
00:33:31.074 --> 00:33:33.052
Three days later, they end up
30 miles down the road

639
00:33:33.076 --> 00:33:36.011
in some farmer's barn with no
concept of time having passed.

640
00:33:36.046 --> 00:33:37.518
They met someone out there.

641
00:33:37.553 --> 00:33:38.959
There has to be something
they're not telling us.

642
00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:40.587
I don't understand,
no concept of time...

643
00:33:40.622 --> 00:33:42.105
KONIK: Our heads go
to complicated places

644
00:33:42.129 --> 00:33:43.271
when we're faced
with undefined anomalies.

645
00:33:43.295 --> 00:33:44.855
KATHERINE:
Mommy.

646
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.373
KONIK: But you guys should
consider yourselves lucky.

647
00:33:46.397 --> 00:33:48.331
Sure, girls keep secrets,

648
00:33:48.366 --> 00:33:51.565
but every test is clean.

649
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.370
Everything is perfectly normal.

650
00:33:54.405 --> 00:33:56.372
Can I go home now?

651
00:33:56.407 --> 00:33:58.308
(hand squeaking on glass)

652
00:33:58.343 --> 00:33:59.672
ANN:
Normally, I hate it

653
00:33:59.707 --> 00:34:01.641
when someone I know
turns up here,

654
00:34:01.676 --> 00:34:05.216
but I got to tell you,
I just about died of happiness

655
00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:07.713
when I saw your name
on the intake board.

656
00:34:07.748 --> 00:34:09.979
- (baby crying loudly)
- Now, don't you worry.

657
00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:14.654
Gonna have you out of here
in no time at all.

658
00:34:14.689 --> 00:34:17.888
I had been praying for you
night and day.

659
00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:19.593
(crying stops)

660
00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:22.629
(hand squeaking on glass)

661
00:34:24.732 --> 00:34:26.633
Can I go home now?

662
00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:31.638
VICTOR:
Okay.

663
00:34:35.776 --> 00:34:38.183
You know that I love you, right?

664
00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:41.846
You know
you can tell me anything.

665
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:45.388
What were you and Katherine
doing out there in those woods?

666
00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:46.917
I don't know.

667
00:34:46.952 --> 00:34:49.227
I wanted to find the...

668
00:34:49.262 --> 00:34:51.493
(sighs)

669
00:34:52.925 --> 00:34:55.596
I wanted to talk to Mama.

670
00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:58.500
Sometimes I hear her voice.

671
00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:01.470
She talks to me.

672
00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:04.638
Yeah, baby, sometimes
I hear her voice, too.

673
00:35:05.773 --> 00:35:08.378
- It doesn't mean...
- I wanted Katherine to hear.

674
00:35:08.413 --> 00:35:10.941
She reads the Bible.
She goes to church.

675
00:35:10.976 --> 00:35:12.844
I wanted to tell if I was crazy.

676
00:35:12.879 --> 00:35:15.517
- If it was really her.
- You're not crazy.

677
00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:23.261
You light a candle.

678
00:35:23.296 --> 00:35:25.296
(laughter)

679
00:35:25.331 --> 00:35:26.924
Clear your mind.

680
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:29.124
- (distorted screams)
- Drip, drop...

681
00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:33.370
You stand in the trees holding
something that you love

682
00:35:33.405 --> 00:35:35.669
that gives you connection.

683
00:35:35.704 --> 00:35:39.101
You just start speaking
what the spirit says to you.

684
00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:41.609
What did the spirit say to you?

685
00:35:43.613 --> 00:35:45.844
(distorted laughter)

686
00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:57.856
She wasn't there.

687
00:35:57.891 --> 00:35:59.726
No one was.

688
00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:03.499
You took the scarf.
That was my connection.

689
00:36:05.767 --> 00:36:07.437
Okay.

690
00:36:14.347 --> 00:36:16.578
Leave me alone now.

691
00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:23.354
Yeah, of course.

692
00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:27.886
Yeah.

693
00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:42.340
(door opens, closes)

694
00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:44.606
(soft squeaking)

695
00:36:46.379 --> 00:36:48.610
(clicking)

696
00:36:50.812 --> 00:36:52.515

I see now why he put me
in the house next door.
