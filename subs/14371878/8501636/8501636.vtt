00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:29.541
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

2
00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:31.875
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

3
00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:34.958
Excuse me. Catalog, please.

4
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.333
<i>Signore,</i> welcome to Venice.

5
00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:40.791
- Thank you.
<i>- Prego.</i>

6
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.125
It feels good to be back.

7
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.291
<i>How we doing, team?</i>

8
00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.958
{\an8}The champagne's on ice,
so let's wrap this up.

9
00:01:58.416 --> 00:01:59.750
{\an8}Ah, no, <i>grazie.</i>

10
00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:03.125
Oh, you must.
You know, they're quite exquisite.

11
00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:04.208
No, thank you.

12
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.833
{\an8}<i>- How does it feel in the hall?</i>
- Nineteen million!

13
00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:10.583
- Rich.
<i>- My favorite feeling.</i>

14
00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.833
{\an8}Nineteen million in London.

15
00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:15.666
{\an8}Going once.

16
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.333
Going twice.

17
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:19.791
{\an8}Sold!

18
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.166
{\an8}Thank you. Thank you.

19
00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:33.625
{\an8}Please, let's now turn
our attention to the next item.

20
00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:38.666
<i>Item number 235
is a painting by Kehinde Wiley</i>

21
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.791
<i>titled</i> The Prelude.

22
00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:42.500
Do I have seven million?

23
00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:44.041
In position, London?

24
00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:45.750
Checking in from the Thames.

25
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.916
Just taking position
near the drop site now.

26
00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:52.125
{\an8}Are you part of Uber Boats now?

27
00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:53.458
{\an8}<i>Stay focused, mate.</i>

28
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.416
{\an8}Going once.

29
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.875
{\an8}All right, then. Let's show them
what true artistry looks like.

30
00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:03.375
{\an8}Sold for 11 million
to Mr. Mollsen in Venice.

31
00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.750
{\an8}Ah great. Tech boy's got a new toy.

32
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:16.125
<i>The Kehinde Wiley
sets another record</i>

33
00:03:16.208 --> 00:03:19.250
{\an8}<i>joining the Hirst and the Franz Marc.</i>

34
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:20.333
{\an8}Ross!

35
00:03:24.541 --> 00:03:27.250
Police.
Cultural Heritage Unit.

36
00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:29.458
<i>Stefano, are you there?</i>

37
00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:30.541
Yes, we're here.

38
00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:32.541
Local police are in position.

39
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.625
If Cyrus tries to swipe anything,
he's in for a surprise.

40
00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:41.208
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to introduce you to N8.

41
00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.166
As you know,
the digital artist

42
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.708
has remained anonymous
throughout his career.

43
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:59.791
But today he's here to auction off
a single-edition NFT...

44
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:02.958
There he is, among the bidders.

45
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.458
He's not even wearing a mask.

46
00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:09.125
He's like, "Here I am."

47
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.166
What's it gonna be, Cyrus?

48
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.666
The Wiley's too hard to transport,
the Warhols are a little tired.

49
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.125
At least we know he won't lift the NFT.

50
00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:19.833
Nothing to lift.

51
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:27.250
And now, it's my honor to present
<i>Self Importrait</i> by N8.

52
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.458
Comprised of 482 cameras,

53
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:35.333
this mask will create the NFT.

54
00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:37.791
Inspired by Vincent van Gogh,

55
00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:42.916
the digital art piece will be generated
from a live 30-second feed.

56
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.625
Once complete, the NFT will
have captured the moment of its sale,

57
00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:50.208
which will include the buyer.

58
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.583
Do we have an opening bid?

59
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.458
Twelve million.

60
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:56.333
What?

61
00:04:56.416 --> 00:04:58.125
Quick. Look up paddle 1305.

62
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:02.583
Uh, registered to John Bratby.

63
00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.583
Shit. He knows we're here.

64
00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:06.541
How'd you know?

65
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:10.625
John Bratby, British, mid-century,
painted scenes of domestic life.

66
00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:13.708
And that gives us away, uh, how?

67
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.833
I'm living in his old studio.

68
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:20.583
<i>Twelve million.</i>

69
00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:23.166
<i>Twelve million is the standing bid.</i>

70
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958
<i>Thirteen million in London.</i>

71
00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:32.041
Fifteen. We have 15 here in Venice.

72
00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:35.375
- 16.5.
- 16.5.

73
00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:39.583
Seventeen million.

74
00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:41.333
Seventeen and a half.

75
00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.791
Welcome to the bidding,
Mr. Sage.

76
00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:46.208
Eighteen million!

77
00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:49.875
Nineteen.

78
00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:53.625
Twenty million.

79
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.458
Twenty million dollars in Venice.

80
00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:02.750
Going once.

81
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.583
Going twice.

82
00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.958
Ready?

83
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:09.041
<i>Ready.</i>

84
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.125
Sold.

85
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.000
Lift.

86
00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:28.125
He's making a move. We need to go in. Go!

87
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:29.291
Go, go!

88
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:31.208
<i>Stefano, let's go!</i>

89
00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:35.666
<i>Leave immediately by the nearest exit.</i>

90
00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.166
Thank you, Stewart.

91
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.583
N8, I'm so sorry for the confusion, sir.
I can escort you out.

92
00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:56.458
Hold on. I just spent $20 million.
I want my NFT.

93
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.458
Perhaps we can make the transfer
at our offices.

94
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:00.083
Or how about my yacht?

95
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.291
Yeah, okay.

96
00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:03.250
Follow me.

97
00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.458
Interpol.
Cultural Heritage Unit.

98
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:19.791
Your auction is being robbed.

99
00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:23.458
- What?
- You need to lock everything down. Now!

100
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.083
Gotcha.

101
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:34.083
Where's the yacht?

102
00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:36.458
This is the boat
that takes us to the yacht.

103
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.166
Ross, what if Cyrus is
making a play for the NFT?

104
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.500
<i>I thought he bought it?</i>

105
00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:46.541
For 20 million?
No way he has that. It's a con.

106
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.250
<i>But the only way to steal an NFT...</i>

107
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:53.250
Is to steal the access code, and the only
way to do that... is to steal the artist.

108
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:26.125
Stefano,
I need a boat at the pier.

109
00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:27.458
<i>Yes, right away.</i>

110
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.500
Just keep them in sight.

111
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.125
Time to play.

112
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:01.625
Stop!

113
00:09:10.541 --> 00:09:12.181
Looks like we've got a tail.

114
00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.041
- What?
- Fans of yours?

115
00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:17.500
Let's go!

116
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.583
Are you sure this is safe?

117
00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:14.291
Go faster!

118
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:25.541
No! No! No! No! No! Right! Right!

119
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.250
Go! Go! Go!

120
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:04.750
Nicely done, team.

121
00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:10.791

It was on a loop,
so all we have is the last 30 seconds.

148
00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:36.833
Here's one angle.

149
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:42.708
Stop. Go back a few seconds.

150

00:12:56.666 --> 00:12:58.125
Again.

155
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:01.875
That limp is an act.

Holy shit. You guys kidnapped me.

168
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:56.625
- Come on!
- Do you feel kidnapped?

No.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.833
So you're thieves?

179
00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:23.625
We rescue works of art
from undeserving owners.

180
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:26.333
And while I took Interpol on a tour...

181
00:14:26.416 --> 00:14:29.291
The rest of our team was in London,
rescuing a Van Gogh.

182
00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:31.500
But you bought my NFT, right?
I mean, I saw...

183
00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:33.208
A legit transaction.

184
00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:37.666
We presold the Van Gogh
on the black market for $20 million.

185
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.375
Enough to cover your NFT.

186
00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:42.250
Then why did you fake my kidnapping?

187
00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:43.333
Borrowing.

188
00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.166
A human.

189
00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:50.000
Leonardo da Vinci sold
<i>The Mona Lisa</i> for $25,000,

190
00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:53.375
and nobody gave a shit about it
for 400 years until someone stole it.

191
00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:58.458
That smile is now worth $860 million
because there's a crazy story behind it.

192
00:14:58.541 --> 00:15:00.208
Just like the one of us borrowing you.

193
00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:04.583
And thanks to Interpol
and all the free publicity, well,

194
00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:07.458
the whole world now thinks
that you've been kidnapped,

195
00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:10.583
which only drove the price
of the NFT through the roof.

196
00:15:10.666 --> 00:15:13.625
- How much did we sell it for?
- We just closed, uh...

197
00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:17.458
Eighty-nine million.

198
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:18.375
What?!

199
00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:19.500
Eighty-nine million.

200
00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:20.750
What?

201
00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:22.666
Eighty-nine million dollars.

202
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.083
I... I beat Van Gogh?

203
00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:28.166
If my calculations are correct,

204
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.083
we made $42 million
and you made 27 million.

205
00:15:33.083 --> 00:15:33.958
Boom!

206
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.208
Let's make a toast.

207
00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:39.916
- All right.
- To the world's first heist of an NFT!

208
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
- Hey!
- Cheers!

209
00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:44.166
<i>Cheers! Hey! Whoo!</i>

210
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.958
<i>Whoo, whoo, whoo!</i>

211
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:49.125
Round of drinks on Luke, guys!
Everyone! Round of drinks!

212
00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:50.291
- No!
- Yes!

213
00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:53.916
Where's Denton?

214
00:15:54.416 --> 00:15:59.333
Forgery, fraud, fraud,
money laundering, impersonation, fraud.

215
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:01.541
Hmm. Grand theft auto?

216
00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:02.625
Yes.

217
00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:05.916
It was a 1967 Ferrari Spider.

218
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.833
- What color?
- Silver.

219
00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:10.500
Walnut dash, cream leather interior.

220
00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:12.916
And you crashed it into a canal?

221
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.625
Okay, I did.

222
00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.375
You know, easy come, easy go.

223
00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:23.916
So... you two go back to Chicago, huh?

224
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:31.083
I've never met this man before in my life.

225
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.041
Oliver might know who he is, though.

226
00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:38.333
Who's Oliver?

227
00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:39.958
Oliver! Oliver!

228
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:43.083
Oliver?

229
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.125
Oliver!

230
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:53.333
Oliver would have never crashed
the Ferrari.

231
00:16:53.416 --> 00:16:54.750
He's too responsible.

232
00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:57.500
Can I talk to Oliver?

233
00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:58.583
No.

234
00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:01.875
Okay, then. Let's talk about RICO.

235
00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:04.166
Thanks to your mess-up with the cane,

236
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.166
we've got you placing a bid you didn't
have the funds to cover, which is fraud.

237
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.875
And because it was over $10 million,
you're eligible for extradition to the US,

238
00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.458
where you're facing 20 years to life.

239
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:16.541
Twenty years <i>is</i> life.

240
00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:18.625
And your friends
are looking at kidnapping,

241
00:17:18.708 --> 00:17:22.166
wire fraud, identity fraud,
and transportation of stolen property.

242
00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:25.000
Did I leave anything out?

243
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:27.208
A little joy, maybe.

244
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:30.666
Boss. Got something.

245
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:34.750
This just came for you.

246
00:17:50.291 --> 00:17:51.583
We're going back to London.

247
00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.458
And we're taking him with us.

248
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:55.875
Yay.

249
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:13.833
Is Denton still in holding?

250
00:18:13.916 --> 00:18:16.750
- You mean Oliver?
- For real?

251
00:18:16.833 --> 00:18:19.125
This Oliver, he is a real pain in the ass.

252
00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:22.375
Gladwell. Come with me, please.

253
00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:25.833
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Right. Wasn't a request.

254
00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:36.583
Everything okay?

255
00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:38.375
If it were, we'd be out of a job.

256
00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:42.375
Listen, I, uh...
I need to borrow your friend Cyrus.

257
00:18:42.458 --> 00:18:45.208
He's not my friend.
And what do you mean, "borrow"?

258
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.125
Well, in the same way
that he would borrow a Picasso.

259
00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:51.125
- I'm gonna offer him a deal.
- What?

260
00:18:51.208 --> 00:18:52.625
- No.
- Yeah.

261
00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:55.083
No, no! You do not get to do this.

262
00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:57.267
You think the art division
is a third-rate department.

263
00:18:57.291 --> 00:18:58.125
It is.

264
00:18:58.208 --> 00:19:01.333
But you do not get to wipe out
a year of my work.

265
00:19:01.416 --> 00:19:04.416
That's literally what I'm doing,
so take a seat and let it sink in.

266
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.000
What do you know about Lars Jorgensen?

267
00:19:15.083 --> 00:19:18.708
- He owns a hell of a lot of stolen art.
- He's done a lot worse than that.

268
00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:21.333
He started as a banker who was legit,

269
00:19:21.416 --> 00:19:23.541
then began putting
his money in terror groups,

270
00:19:23.625 --> 00:19:27.458
bankrolling attacks, then shorting
irrelevant stocks and making a fortune.

271
00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:31.416
He doesn't care how many people die,
just how much ends up in his bank account.

272
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.250
Remember the New Zealand plane
that went down? 183 dead.

273
00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:37.166
Airline stock plummeted
just like those poor souls.

274
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.875
And guess who made a fortune
off shorting that stock?

275
00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.375
So why haven't you arrested him?

276
00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:44.708
It's what I've been trying to do
for years, but nothing can stick.

277
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:46.166
Everyone's scared of him.

278
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.208
Except that now,
I have someone on the inside.

279
00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:49.291
This guy.

280
00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:51.458
Arthur Tigue.

281
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.083
Now, Jorgensen's been paying Tigue
to work on something new.

282
00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:56.458
I caught him,
I turned him, and I got him to talk.

283
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:58.541
According to this weasel,

284
00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.750
Jorgensen's been chatting
with the hacker group Leviathan.

285
00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:02.750
Leviathan?

286
00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:05.333
They're planning some kind
of massive strike on water.

287
00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:08.166
Utilities, dams, it's all on the grid now.

288
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.041
They could flood a city.

289
00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.833
Dry up a whole country if they wanted.

290
00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:14.291
Millions could die.

291
00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:16.833
And Jorgensen would make billions off it.

292
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.333
He's been shorting stocks and utilities.

293
00:20:19.416 --> 00:20:21.375
We don't know when
or where he's gonna strike.

294
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:25.166
But what we do know is that
Leviathan want their payment in gold.

295
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.083
Half a billion dollars in gold,
to be precise.

296
00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:29.375
And Jorgensen is gonna move it

297
00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:32.500
from his vault
in London to Zurich in 17 days.

298
00:20:32.583 --> 00:20:35.833
- You can't intercept it because it's...
- Totally legal...

299
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:37.625
To move your own gold.

300
00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:44.958
No.

301
00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.541
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

302
00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:50.583
- You don't know what I'll ask.
- I do.

303
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.666
- You don't.
- You want Cyrus to nick the gold.

304
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.875
Well, I wouldn't have used
the word "nick," but...

305
00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:58.416
You want to rely on Cyrus Whitaker
for an operation of this scale?

306
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.791
Trust him with
half a billion dollars worth of gold?

307
00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:03.375
Yeah, why not?

308
00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:06.000
He's a thief,
a con man, a professional liar.

309
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:07.625
You cannot possibly trust him.

310
00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:09.833
I work in a building
with intelligence agents,

311
00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:12.500
and I don't trust any of them.
'Cause we're all liars. All of us.

312
00:21:12.583 --> 00:21:14.708
- What's another one?
- It is not the same thing.

313
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:17.791
Our job is to do things we don't like
and make calls we don't want,

314
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.375
so the rest of the world
can just carry on.

315
00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:23.791
What if he says no?

316
00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:26.208
It's your job to make sure
that doesn't happen.

317
00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:01.000
Took you long enough.

318
00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:08.541
Can I get you a drink?

319
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:11.791
What is it? Tequila during the day,
vodka by night, right?

320
00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:14.333
I'll get it.

321
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:16.416
All the good stuff is in the back.

322
00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:21.000
Yeah. But we wouldn't want you to take
all year to find it. Let me help you.

323
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.750
You look good.

324
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:33.125
You know, it is pretty funny
that the thing that got you busted

325
00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:34.208
was an NFT.

326
00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:38.333
A little tacky.

327
00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:42.291
Sometimes, you gotta roll with the times.
And stop, we didn't steal anything.

328
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:45.000
That NFT was
a completely legitimate transaction.

329
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.500
Right. Of course.

330
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:51.000
- Am I in trouble?
- For stealing a Van Gogh?

331
00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:52.875
We caught your buyer.

332
00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:55.416
He gave up Denton, Luke, and Magnus.

333
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.541
That was real cute, by the way,
nicking the painting that was in the NFT.

334
00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:01.666
Thought you'd appreciate
the artistry involved.

335
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.750
You stole art, Cyrus. You didn't make it.

336
00:23:07.041 --> 00:23:08.750
Are you still pissed about Paris?

337
00:23:10.791 --> 00:23:13.000
- I'm not going to discuss that with you.
- No?

338
00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:15.375
- No.
- I was kind of hoping we could.

339
00:23:15.458 --> 00:23:19.375
- It was a mistake, okay? An accident.
- An accident? For a full week?

340
00:23:19.458 --> 00:23:21.541
It was five days, not a week!

341
00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:22.833
A business week.

342
00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:25.833
And if I'd have known
who you were, what you did,

343
00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:27.416
it would never have happened.

344
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.500
So, what about you?

345
00:23:28.583 --> 00:23:31.500
I mean, I thought I was going to dinner
with the curator of the Gagosian.

346
00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:33.125
- I was undercover.
- So was I.

347
00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:34.916
- Not the same.
- Agree to disagree.

348
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.875
We fell for the cover. That's it.

349
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:40.583
That's all it was.

350
00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.083
Okay, so what is this?

351
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.666
- Are you here to arrest me, Abby?
- Agent Gladwell.

352
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.583
Agent?

353
00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:49.708
And no.

354
00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:54.875
I have been ordered to offer you a deal.

355
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.291
Wow.

356
00:23:59.791 --> 00:24:01.583
That's gotta sting, huh?

357
00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:03.166
Is that why you're so pissed?

358
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:04.958
What kind of deal?

359
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.000
We need you to steal something.

360
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:12.708
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Do me a favor. Say it again.

361
00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:16.875
- But slower. Say it slower this time.
- Gold. A lot of gold.

362
00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.875
Half a billion dollars' worth.

363
00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:22.625
What's the catch?

364
00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:26.250
The owner of the gold
is a man named Lars Jorgensen.

365
00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:28.875
You know him?

366
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.375
By reputation, yeah.

367
00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:35.083
There's some people you steal from,

368
00:24:35.166 --> 00:24:37.126
and there's some people
that you don't steal from.

369
00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:39.041
Lars Jorgensen kills both.

370
00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:41.375
It's a hard pass for me.

371
00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:46.416
We have you on the Van Gogh, Cyrus.

372
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.958
Denton will die in jail.

373
00:24:50.041 --> 00:24:54.416
If you do this,
it's full immunity for you and your crew.

374
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.541
All felonies wiped clean,
past and present.

375
00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:00.583
Camila hasn't seen
her family in eight years.

376
00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:03.208
Mi-Sun has a grandmother
who doesn't have long to live.

377
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:05.166
Luke gets to see his poodle again.

378
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.625
Magnus gets to go
to the Cajun Stage at Jazz Fest.

379
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:11.083
Denton gets to go home, and you...

380
00:25:11.791 --> 00:25:13.833
You get to do

381
00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:15.708
whatever it is you do

382
00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:19.416
without looking over
your shoulder all the time.

383
00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:23.375
- Where are you at in all this?
- What do you mean?

384
00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:25.041
What's your role in the operation?

385
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:27.166
This is my role.
I make you the offer, that's it.

386
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.416
No, no. If we're signing up for this,
then so are you.

387
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.875
Look, I know how these things work.
If Interpol's involved,

388
00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:36.041
that means as soon as things hit the fan
that we're left hung out to dry.

389
00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:38.750
But if you're with us,
then they can't do that.

390
00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:39.666
With you?

391
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.875
On the team.

392
00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.750
- Interpol would never allow it.
- So then ask them.

393
00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:46.708
No you, no deal.

394
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:49.291
You got 24 hours to respond,
Agent Gladwell.

395
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:01.333
No.

396
00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:02.583
She's Interpol.

397
00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:06.375
- Are you crazy?
- Absolutely not. No disrespect, yeah?

398
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:07.875
- But no.
- It's a setup.

399
00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:10.500
It's a half a billion in gold.

400
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:13.541
- That we don't get to keep.
- Yeah, but we get to see it.

401
00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.958
What do you want me to say?

402
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:18.375
If we don't do this, we go to jail.
She has us on the Van Gogh.

403
00:26:18.458 --> 00:26:22.000
Plus, and not that this should sway
anyone, but it's about saving lives.

404
00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:24.250
- Saving lives. Lovely.
- Don't lead with that.

405
00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:27.041
- Boo!
- Oh no, no. No, no.

406
00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:28.541
Uh-uh.

407
00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:31.541
I don't appreciate
the emotional blackmail, Cyrus.

408
00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:35.958
This is not emotional blackmail.
This is <i>blackmail</i> blackmail.

409
00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:39.750
I just want to say
that I am liking the vibes here.

410
00:26:39.833 --> 00:26:42.250
I think they're good.
I think it's fun. I'm on board.

411
00:26:42.333 --> 00:26:44.250
Yeah. Of course you are.
Because you're crazy.

412
00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:45.625
We gotta stay positive.

413
00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:49.583
- Come on, you don't have to throw a no...
- Take a moment. Don't escalate it.

414
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:52.166
- Get out of here!
- You get outta here!

415
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.333
Tiny!

416
00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:55.833
Hey! It's Oliver!

417
00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.333
Oliver!

418
00:26:58.125 --> 00:26:59.541
I love Oliver!

419
00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:05.208
Agent Gladwell,
I just wanted to introduce you to Oliver.

420
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:08.875
Wow, I have heard a lot about you.

421
00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:11.543
- Oliver's my favorite.
- Steve?

422
00:27:11.583 --> 00:27:12.416
Scary.

423
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.541
All right, Agent Gladwell has the floor.
Let's give our attention.

424
00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:18.750
- Why should we?
- Because she caught us.

425
00:27:21.375 --> 00:27:23.791
She knows what she's doing. Go ahead.

426
00:27:24.791 --> 00:27:25.791
Thank you.

427
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:28.458
Okay.

428
00:27:30.791 --> 00:27:34.291
So, 17 days from now,
Lars Jorgensen is moving

429
00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:38.208
half a billion dollars in gold bars
from his bank in London to Zurich.

430
00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:39.291
Nice.

431
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:42.625
The bars will be packed
in a single four-foot square crate,

432
00:27:42.708 --> 00:27:44.916
total weight, ten tons,

433
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.416
then delivered by truck from the bank
to Heathrow under heavy guard

434
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.958
and loaded onto
a Sky Suisse passenger plane to Zurich.

435
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:55.958
So, somewhere between the Bank of London

436
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:59.958
and the runway in Zurich,
the gold needs to disappear.

437
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:03.458
Gold needs to disappear. Great.

438
00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:05.083
That gave me chills.

439
00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:10.000
Well, it's an exciting story. It's...

440
00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.250
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible.

441
00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:13.458
Oh, this is.

442
00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:16.208
Stay positive. We can do this.
Try it with me.

443
00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:18.291
What I can do is beat your ass.

444
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:19.375
Want your ass beat?

445
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:21.583
I can understand what you're saying.

446
00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:24.208
Come on. Stop.
Camila, I'm with you.

447
00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:25.708
I don't know if it's possible.

448
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:30.541
I don't like it any more than any of you,
but we know the rules to our game.

449
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:33.541
- When you're beat, what do you do?
- Accept defeat gracefully?

450
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:35.625
AKA you go to jail or...

451
00:28:35.708 --> 00:28:37.208
Look for the nearest exit.

452
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:40.958
That's right! This is it. So we do it,
we do it well, and we get out.

453
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:42.833
Let's treat it like any other lift.

454
00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:45.000
Examine it from top to bottom,
find a weakness.

455
00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:47.041
If there's a way to do it, we find it.

456
00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:49.375
None of us want to go to jail.

457
00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:52.291
And we damn sure
don't want to piss off Lars Jorgensen.

458
00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.333
Morning, Arthur.

459
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.791
So you didn't make it home
from the pub last night, then, eh?

460
00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:17.375
Okay! Okay!

461
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:20.291
Stop!

462
00:29:21.416 --> 00:29:22.500
Hey, Jorgensen,

463
00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:24.208
<i>you remember Arthur Tigue.</i>

464
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.375
He used to work for us.

465
00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:28.625
Yes. Mr. Tigue.

466
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.708
{\an8}I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person.

467
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:34.000
{\an8}I just arrived at my villa.

468
00:29:34.083 --> 00:29:35.583
<i>Please, sir! I'm sorry!</i>

469
00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:38.416
Stop begging. It'll just make him
more inclined to violence.

470
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.458
You were arrested last month
on smuggling charges.

471
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:45.958
And yet, here you are, a free man.

472
00:29:46.041 --> 00:29:46.875
It's odd.

473
00:29:46.958 --> 00:29:48.083
Very odd.

474
00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:50.458
<i>Interpol only knows half the story!</i>

475
00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:52.666
What about the other half?

476
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.625
<i>You should have kept your mouth shut.</i>

477
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:56.791
<i>Now we are going to shut it for you.</i>

478
00:29:56.875 --> 00:29:59.291
- No!
<i>- Cormac, feed the dog.</i>

479
00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:02.958
No! Cormac, please!

480
00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:19.458
What are you doing?

481
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:21.666
I hope you know your team
have been working all night

482
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.041
and half the day
trying to figure this out.

483
00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:27.958
The teachers hated you, didn't they?

484
00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:29.921
What? No. I was top of the class.
They loved me.

485
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.041
No. They had to pretend
to like students like you

486
00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:34.916
because, technically, you followed
all the rules and got good grades.

487
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.458
What's wrong with that?

488
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:37.541
It's boring.

489
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.208
Anybody can do what they're told.
Anybody can memorize facts.

490
00:30:42.291 --> 00:30:44.125
Anybody can shine an apple on their ass.

491
00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:47.375
And what were you like?
Class clown? Wiseass?

492
00:30:47.458 --> 00:30:48.583
I was the opposite.

493
00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:50.291
I was silent.

494
00:30:50.875 --> 00:30:53.000
I was watching the kids
look at the blackboard,

495
00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:55.875
answering the questions
where they thought they should answer.

496
00:30:55.958 --> 00:30:57.541
I never looked at the blackboard.

497
00:30:58.375 --> 00:31:01.083
I was looking at the questions
that weren't being asked.

498
00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:02.875
To cool for school, huh?

499
00:31:04.208 --> 00:31:06.541
I saw the path
that they were being marched down,

500
00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.833
and I also saw a different path,
a better one for me.

501
00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:10.791
So I took it.

502
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.000
By breaking the rules?

503
00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:14.625
The rules were already broken
for someone like me.

504
00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:17.833
And if I can remember correctly,
you broke a few rules that week in Paris.

505
00:31:17.916 --> 00:31:20.166
Five days! And yes, I did.

506
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.916
I broke the rules
for the first time in my life

507
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.666
and look what good it did me.

508
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.958
- Why do you care about 'em?
- About what?

509
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:29.583
The rules. Why do you care
so much about the rules?

510
00:31:33.666 --> 00:31:34.666
Okay.

511
00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:41.208
Okay, when I was a kid,

512
00:31:42.083 --> 00:31:44.000
my mom was headmistress at my school.

513
00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:47.416
It was kind of a shithole,
but it had this picture,

514
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.291
a Hockney print that had been given
to the school in the '70s,

515
00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:53.750
and my mum refused to sell it.

516
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.166
Because she wanted us to know
that we deserved beautiful things.

517
00:32:00.541 --> 00:32:04.500
That our school was just as important
as some swanky art gallery.

518
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.416
That we should all dream big.

519
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:13.041
And then someone stole it.

520
00:32:13.875 --> 00:32:15.125
Middle of the night.

521
00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:16.791
And I thought,

522
00:32:16.875 --> 00:32:18.416
"When I grow up

523
00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:21.333
I'm going to find out who did that

524
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:23.666
and bring them down."

525
00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:26.125
And did you?

526
00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:29.333
No.

527
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.291
But I did the next best thing.

528
00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:36.208
Interpol.

529
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.166
Dream big.

530
00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:42.291
I admire that.

531
00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:48.750
Oh no.

532
00:32:49.708 --> 00:32:53.500
- No, no, no. I'm not doing this.
- Doing what? What are you talking about?

533
00:32:53.583 --> 00:32:56.208
Getting sucked in
to a conversation with you.

534
00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:59.017
- Conversation. Is that dangerous?
- How did you put it with your team?

535
00:32:59.041 --> 00:33:01.833
"Find the weakness,
do the job, and get out"?

536
00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:06.916
- Is that what you think I did?
- I know it is.

537
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.083
I would never lift from anyone
that doesn't deserve to lose it.

538
00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:12.958
And if I do my job well,

539
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.208
well, the thing I took,
they'll never know was missing.

540
00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:18.708
So you're saying we need to take the gold

541
00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:21.458
in a way that Jorgensen
never knows it's missing.

542
00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:23.083
We're not taking the gold.

543
00:33:23.583 --> 00:33:27.541
That's the problem on the blackboard.
We're looking at a different problem.

544
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:29.666
We are taking the plane?

545
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.625
Nice!

546
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:33.291
- The whole plane?
- It's kind of hard to take half a plane.

547
00:33:33.375 --> 00:33:35.041
With 250 people on board?

548
00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:38.083
We're not hijacking a plane, Cyrus.
It's not the '70s.

549
00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:40.166
We're not hijacking anything, Camila.

550
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.208
Don't ever use that word.

551
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:44.833
- We're borrowing it.
- Love it. Love it.

552
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:46.000
But how?

553
00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:48.208
To take a plane, you gotta fake a plane.

554
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:51.083
- All you need is a private jet.
- Oh, just like that?

555
00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:54.583
Yeah. If you can get
the planes close enough together,

556
00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:56.500
you can swap the radar signature.

557
00:33:56.583 --> 00:33:59.208
- I like it.
- Pulling up the flight logs now.

558
00:33:59.291 --> 00:34:01.125
See if we know anyone on the sheets.

559
00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:06.916
Drake's Boeing is at Farnborough.
He must have a gig in London.

560
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Too big.

561
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:10.958
The King's Hawker is at Northolt.

562
00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:12.083
Too small.

563
00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:13.875
Hmm.

564
00:34:13.958 --> 00:34:16.875
- Oh.
- You're gonna like this.

565
00:34:19.958 --> 00:34:21.666
You want me to give you my jet?

566
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.708
No, I want to rent it.

567
00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:25.666
But there are apps for that, man.

568
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.416
Or I can get my guy N8 to make
an NFT specifically for you.

569
00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:35.458
I don't know. My jet is priceless.

570
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:38.833
It's a one-off concept model. NASA R&D.

571
00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:42.541
Hell, technically, it's not even legal
with the mods.

572
00:34:43.375 --> 00:34:44.958
Especially with the glass roof.

573
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.875
I'm not supposed to fly
in American airspace.

574
00:34:47.958 --> 00:34:48.958
I do, though.

575
00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:53.833
It's worth it too, to watch the stars
while, you know, you get your groove on.

576
00:34:53.916 --> 00:34:55.083
- Here's the thing...
- Yeah?

577
00:34:55.166 --> 00:34:58.333
You told an officer at Interpol you've
been illegally flying in US airspace.

578
00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:00.458
- But, he...
- So how about this?

579
00:35:00.541 --> 00:35:03.666
We take the plane,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

580
00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:08.541
Everything is remote-controlled.

581
00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:11.833
Doors, lights. Amazing, right?

582
00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:15.333
That is a word that you could use.

583
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.041
Leave it. No, don't sit down.

584
00:35:20.125 --> 00:35:22.416
- Why not?
- Because I don't know what that stain is.

585
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.541
Ugh.

586
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.666
<i>- ♪ Bitch, I'm a big dude ♪

587

Oh, stripper pole.

589
00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:39.333
Oh, oh! And the best part of this baby
is the whole of the underneath

590
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:44.416
is a huge LED screen, which we can program

591
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.125
to say whatever

592
00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:48.500
we want.

593
00:35:53.208 --> 00:35:54.875
Gucci life.

594
00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.916
Ball so hard. Ball so hard. Ball so hard.

595
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.166
- You don't have to do that.
- Ball so hard.

596
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.291
We get it.

597
00:36:05.375 --> 00:36:06.750
- Ball so...
- We understand.

598
00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:09.375
Come on.

599
00:36:26.625 --> 00:36:28.791
So this is the best Interpol could do?

600
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.375
You work for the government now, Cyrus.

601
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.250
Doesn't it make you feel
all warm and fuzzy?

602
00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:37.750
No. Not one bit.

603
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:44.250
So, let's break it down.

604
00:36:45.125 --> 00:36:47.666
We gotta make
that jet invisible to radar,

605
00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:52.500
<i>find a way to get it close
to an A380 to swap signals,</i>

606
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:55.500
<i>then crack a safe at 30,000 feet.</i>

607
00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:57.333
<i>Piece of cake.</i>

608
00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:00.625
Cyrus.

609
00:37:00.708 --> 00:37:02.916
- Yeah?
- All right, you gotta see this.

610
00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:12.041
<i>♪ Wake up, wake up
Grab a brush and put a little makeup... ♪</i>

611
00:37:12.125 --> 00:37:14.416
The sound waves
mimic the turbulence of the plane!

612
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.300
<i>♪ Why'd you leave the keys

613
00:37:16.375 --> 00:37:18.250

00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:20.434
<i>♪ Grab a brush and put a little makeup

615
00:37:20.458 --> 00:37:22.138

<i>♪ You wanted to ♪</i>

618
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.250
With this laser, I could crack this vault

619
00:37:27.333 --> 00:37:30.625
anywhere on earth in ten minutes flat,
but it's gotta be on earth.

620
00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:33.875
Up in the plane, the turbulence
is going to shake the laser.

621
00:37:33.958 --> 00:37:35.666
If I'm a millimeter off in any direction,

622
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.625
this... this vault turns into
an impenetrable steel box.

623
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:42.000
So you need a stabilizer.

624
00:37:44.208 --> 00:37:45.583
Stewart platform?

625
00:37:47.625 --> 00:37:49.250
Stewart platform. That's it.

626
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:54.541
Stewart platform! Genius!
Someone give me a hug!

627
00:37:55.375 --> 00:37:56.750
- A lot of caffeine.
- Mm.

628
00:38:06.375 --> 00:38:08.083
<i>Descend! Descend!</i>

629
00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:11.750
<i>Descend!</i>

630
00:38:11.833 --> 00:38:14.458
I keep getting caught
in the A380's wake.

631
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:16.916
Stop it. I've seen you handle much worse.

632
00:38:17.416 --> 00:38:19.041
You remember Corsica, don't you?

633
00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:22.916
Okay.

634
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.958
Camila needs help
staying out of the A380's wake.

635
00:38:28.708 --> 00:38:31.208
Can you work N8's cameras
into your stealth mods

636
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:33.291
to give her full visibility
around the plane?

637
00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:37.625
I mean, at those speeds,
it just hasn't been done before.

638
00:38:37.708 --> 00:38:38.916
First time for everything.

639
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.791
- I mean, if anybody can do it, you can.
- Yeah.

640
00:38:42.708 --> 00:38:43.708
Right?

641
00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.500
I got it.

642
00:38:50.666 --> 00:38:51.708
My guy.

643
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:55.458
Mi-Sun, I'm gonna need a hand.

644
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:58.125
Hey, uh, too much? Or...

645
00:38:58.208 --> 00:39:01.458
Are you going for, like,
Gandalf the Grey? Or Moses?

646
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:03.416
- No.
- Then, yeah, that's too much.

647
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.875
Um...

648
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.708
- Am I crazy?
- Yes.

649
00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:12.958
- You think I should call it off?
- No, of course not.

650
00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:14.791
I don't know.

651
00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:17.875
You're uncertain?
I don't think I've seen that before.

652
00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:19.916
I just don't like that it's her who asked.

653
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.083
- You know the history there, right?
- No.

654
00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:26.041
Met a year ago in Paris at the Biennale,

655
00:39:26.625 --> 00:39:29.083
but neither of us were honest
about our circumstances, so...

656
00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.041
I see.

657
00:39:30.125 --> 00:39:33.458
But it was nothing. It was a week.
A business week, not even a full week.

658
00:39:33.541 --> 00:39:35.291
Right. I understand.

659
00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:37.708
Why you say it like that?
What does that mean?

660
00:39:37.791 --> 00:39:40.083
Well, it's just, you know,
the way you look at her.

661
00:39:40.166 --> 00:39:41.916
The way I look at her?
How do I look at her?

662
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:51.541
- What are you doing?
- This is what...

663
00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:52.750
You saying I make that face?

664
00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:54.513
- I've never made a face like that.
- This?

665
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.875
Nobody makes that face.
All right, how about you stop?

666
00:39:57.958 --> 00:39:59.458
Let's stop. You're being stupid.

667
00:39:59.541 --> 00:40:01.750
- Grow up, you're being childish.
- Look at me.

668
00:40:01.833 --> 00:40:03.916
- I'm looking at you!
- Now look at her.

669
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.458
- You want me to look?
- Yeah.

670
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.708
Look like a damn creep. Proud of yourself?

671
00:40:17.791 --> 00:40:20.250
- Yes.
- It doesn't matter, right?

672
00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:23.708
I mean, what we're talking about,
this thing like that, it'll never happen.

673
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:25.875
- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

674
00:40:25.958 --> 00:40:28.833
- Yeah?
- The same reason none of us are married.

675
00:40:28.916 --> 00:40:31.583
Why we don't have kids,
why you don't have a personal life.

676
00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:34.125
The game we're in
is not compatible with love.

677
00:40:34.208 --> 00:40:36.375
- That's a little lonely, no?
- Lonely?

678
00:40:36.458 --> 00:40:38.958
How about when we partied
for New Year's Eve, Taj Mahal?

679
00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:43.791
I'm saying there's respect
and there's admiration and friendships,

680
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.791
but is there closeness? Is there intimacy?

681
00:40:47.375 --> 00:40:49.708
I just told you. That's not what it is.

682
00:40:49.791 --> 00:40:51.500
- Right, it's nothing.
- It's not...

683
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:54.250
I know. I heard you.
You said that. Nothing.

684
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.375
- Think about it.
- Thanks, boss.

685
00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:06.750
So Luke is working on making
the private jet invisible to GPS,

686
00:41:06.833 --> 00:41:10.583
but to do the same for the A380,
we need a PSID.

687
00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:11.500
What's that?

688
00:41:11.583 --> 00:41:13.666
Portable Signal Interference Device.

689
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:18.125
It blocks all GPS transmissions
from the A380 to air traffic control.

690
00:41:18.208 --> 00:41:20.625
But I'm already working on getting
the parts.

691
00:41:20.708 --> 00:41:21.916
They'll be here tomorrow.

692
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.500
Okay, so what's the problem?

693
00:41:25.375 --> 00:41:30.291
The chance of us turning on the PSID and
the transponder at the exact same moment

694
00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:33.875
in two different planes,
both moving over 700 miles per hour,

695
00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:35.666
is next to impossible.

696
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.250
So if air traffic control suddenly see
two planes with the same signal

697
00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:41.541
or if the A380 suddenly disappears...

698
00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:43.000
It's over.

699
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.166
If you can't hack the tech,
you gotta hack the people.

700
00:41:48.625 --> 00:41:51.375
- We need someone in air traffic control.
- In Brussels.

701
00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:52.291
Why Brussels?

702
00:41:52.375 --> 00:41:54.625
The minute the plane
crosses the English Channel,

703
00:41:54.708 --> 00:41:56.708
that's who'll be tracking it till Zurich.

704
00:41:56.791 --> 00:41:58.750
Do we know someone in Brussels?

705
00:42:01.416 --> 00:42:02.875
I know someone.

706
00:42:03.708 --> 00:42:06.291
He's a piece of shit, but I know someone.

707
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:33.541
Well, I don't know what this is,
but it's not a cappuccino, Claude.

708
00:42:33.625 --> 00:42:34.958
Screw you, Harry.

709
00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:37.333
Hey! I'm trying to help you.
I'm being honest.

710
00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:38.791
People won't stand for that.

711
00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:41.041
Starbucks'll come along,
and you'll be done.

712
00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:42.791
I'm not going to pay for it.

713
00:42:42.875 --> 00:42:44.041
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

714
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:45.791
I'll drink it.

715
00:42:45.875 --> 00:42:47.541
I'm just not going to pay for it.

716
00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:49.833
Sort your life out, yeah?

717
00:42:54.666 --> 00:42:55.750
Free coffee?

718
00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:01.875
You know this guy, how?

719
00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:03.750
Harry is an informant.

720
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.875
We had to relocate him to Belgium,
because so many people wanted him dead.

721
00:43:10.791 --> 00:43:12.833
Thought you were here to ask me a favor.

722
00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:15.875
We are. We need help
with air traffic control in Brussels.

723
00:43:15.958 --> 00:43:17.678
Someone who can
communicate with the pilots,

724
00:43:17.708 --> 00:43:19.500
overlook any potential glitches.

725
00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:20.791
Glitches.

726
00:43:20.875 --> 00:43:23.333
Sounds nefarious. Is this official?

727
00:43:24.041 --> 00:43:25.041
Yes and no.

728
00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:27.875
Then I could lose my job.
I could go to jail.

729
00:43:27.958 --> 00:43:31.041
They could pin a terrorism charge on me,
so thanks, but no thanks.

730
00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:32.458
Interpol will protect you.

731
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:35.875
I really,
really want to say yes, but...

732
00:43:37.416 --> 00:43:38.791
You'll be saving lives.

733
00:43:41.708 --> 00:43:43.125
We'll pay you a million dollars.

734
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.541
Happy to be in business with you.

735
00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:51.250
- Cyrus. We don't have that kind of money.
- I do.

736
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.833
- You'd do that?
- Yeah, it's about saving lives, isn't it?

737
00:43:55.916 --> 00:43:57.541
Listen to the man! Listen to him.

738
00:43:59.583 --> 00:44:03.541
You wouldn't happen to know anyone
who can load cargo off an A380, would you?

739
00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:05.291
I might know a few people, yeah.

740
00:44:05.791 --> 00:44:08.208
It's Huxley. He wants to see us.

741
00:44:14.083 --> 00:44:15.125
Hey.

742
00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:18.916
Commander Dennis Huxley,
London Metropolitan Police Service,

743
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.041
seconded to Interpol Anti-Terrorism.

744
00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:22.958
Is that your full name?

745
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.958
Why don't we take a seat?
This'll be quick.

746
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.500
Really?

747
00:44:34.083 --> 00:44:36.833
Okay, big dog.

748
00:44:38.666 --> 00:44:43.166
So, Arthur Tigue washed up
on the Irish coast in six grocery bags.

749
00:44:44.291 --> 00:44:46.333
- What?
- Who's Arthur Tigue?

750
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.458
You didn't tell him?

751
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:52.625
Arthur Tigue was an employee of Jorgensen.

752
00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:53.583
And he was found dead?

753
00:44:53.666 --> 00:44:57.250
Yeah, and it's why we think the bank's
brought the transfer to ten days from now.

754
00:44:57.333 --> 00:44:58.333
Ten days?

755
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
That's not enough time.
I'm sorry, Abby, I'm out.

756
00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:03.208
Cyrus, it's...

757
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:06.208
You're out? I didn't realize
this was an opt-in situation.

758
00:45:06.291 --> 00:45:08.375
- It was when I opted in.
- Uh-huh.

759
00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:10.916
And unlike Arthur Tigue,
I'm smart enough to walk away.

760
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.416
You're smart or you're scared?

761
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.958
'Cause you're worried that
you're going to get killed? Don't worry.

762
00:45:16.041 --> 00:45:18.208
You're from the art world,
and you're small-time.

763
00:45:18.291 --> 00:45:19.708
Made you a brilliant choice.

764
00:45:19.791 --> 00:45:21.750
No one's expecting anything
from Cyrus Whitaker.

765
00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:24.416
And if you don't do this,
I will take away your immunity,

766
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.916
and I'll bring the power of international
law down on you and your misfits.

767
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.208
<i>Comprende,</i> homeboy?

768
00:45:30.958 --> 00:45:32.458
- Better get your boy.
- Guys!

769
00:45:32.541 --> 00:45:34.916
Guys, innocent people's lives
are on the line.

770
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.666
I will talk to my team,

771
00:45:45.166 --> 00:45:48.083
but understand that if we do this,
we're doing it for you.

772
00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:50.291
It's not for him.

773
00:45:55.583 --> 00:45:56.958
See you back in London.

774
00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:03.958
Don't say it.

775
00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:06.125
"Homeboy?"

776
00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:16.291
<i>...saying his cabinet
will meet tomorrow morning,</i>

777
00:46:16.375 --> 00:46:18.833
<i>in order to declare a state of alarm.</i>

778
00:46:18.916 --> 00:46:19.791
- Luke?
- Yeah?

779
00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:20.708
Turn that up.

780
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:22.708
{\an8}<i>Once again, chaos in Madrid tonight</i>

781
00:46:22.791 --> 00:46:26.375
{\an8}<i>with reports that cyberterrorists have
targeted the city's main water grid.</i>

782
00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:29.500
<i>Reports of widespread flooding
in the streets and subways,</i>

783
00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:32.208
<i>and pipes bursting
in homes across the city.</i>

784
00:46:32.291 --> 00:46:37.083
<i>The death toll currently stands at 13,
but that number is expected to rise.</i>

785
00:46:37.166 --> 00:46:38.958
Is this him? Jorgensen?

786
00:46:39.041 --> 00:46:40.333
Looks like it.

787
00:46:40.916 --> 00:46:41.916
Oh my God.

788
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.375
{\an8}Why would anyone
do something like this?

789
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.958
{\an8}He'll sacrifice anyone
to make a profit.

790
00:46:48.041 --> 00:46:51.250
And these are just the starters.
The main course is in ten days.

791
00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:52.333
Ten days?

792
00:46:53.666 --> 00:46:54.875
You're kidding, right?

793
00:46:54.958 --> 00:46:56.166
No, I'm not kidding.

794
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.291
I'm pulling it. This is no longer our job.

795
00:46:58.375 --> 00:47:00.750
- What? Cyrus, you said...
- I said I would.

796
00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:02.583
The deal was me.

797
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.250
I told you when you joined the crew

798
00:47:06.333 --> 00:47:08.541
I'd never let you walk
into certain danger.

799
00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:10.250
I'm telling you all to walk away.

800
00:47:12.291 --> 00:47:15.125
And what's your plan without us?

801
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:18.500
I'll figure it out.
It's not your problem, not anymore.

802
00:47:19.125 --> 00:47:21.375
- You're serious?
- I am.

803
00:47:21.458 --> 00:47:25.750
You just expect us to walk away
and let you have all the fun? No.

804
00:47:25.833 --> 00:47:27.541
- That look like fun?
- Not that.

805
00:47:27.625 --> 00:47:30.583
We're dealing with a guy willing
to kill whatever gets in his way.

806
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.333
I'm sorry, it's too much of a risk.

807
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.583
You know how much I like risk.

808
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.166
It's not just about us.

809
00:47:51.166 --> 00:47:52.166
I'm in.

810
00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:55.166
Me too.

811
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:57.833
- Denton...
- Cyrus, I'm in.

812
00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:59.500
Yeah, me too.

813
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:02.625
I can't leave you with... this.

814
00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:07.833
Count me in too.

815
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:16.791
Yeah, me too, I... I guess.

816
00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:20.291
You can't do this without us.

817
00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:31.166
Let's work.

818
00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:37.000
They really love you.

819
00:48:40.416 --> 00:48:42.416
I mean, what's not to love?

820
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.500
- What did it take you? Like a week?
- Oh my God.

821
00:48:47.083 --> 00:48:50.166
You are really, really easy to hate.

822
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.750
Agree to disagree.

823
00:48:53.375 --> 00:48:55.333
Five days.

824
00:48:57.958 --> 00:48:59.166
I'm impressed.

825
00:49:00.416 --> 00:49:02.416
My portfolio thanks you.

826
00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:06.541
<i>You wanted proof.
Leviathan always delivers.</i>

827
00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:09.833
You can end
your little demonstration now.

828
00:49:09.916 --> 00:49:11.791
<i>Just have our gold ready.</i>

829
00:49:11.875 --> 00:49:12.916
I will.

830
00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:17.041
Hmm.

831
00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:24.916
I built the PSID so we can make
the A380 disappear from radar,

832
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.416
but there's one small issue.

833
00:49:30.583 --> 00:49:31.750
It looks like a bomb.

834
00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:35.375
- Yeah.
- Is that <i>not</i> a bomb?

835
00:49:35.458 --> 00:49:38.458
- Definitely looks like a bomb.
- Yeah.

836
00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:41.083
Does it separate into parts?

837
00:49:41.166 --> 00:49:42.500
In theory.

838
00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:46.708
So, could you hide those parts
and then give each of us pieces?

839
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.583
Then we reassemble it on the plane.

840
00:49:52.416 --> 00:49:54.541
Hmm. Possible.

Okay, guys, listen up.

850
00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:25.416
We need to intercept the gold
before it gets to Jorgensen

851
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.875
so he can't pay the hackers.

852
00:50:29.625 --> 00:50:32.958
A little more to the left.
Just checking the LED screen now.

853
00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:38.083
- We get the pilot we wanted?
- Yes.

854
00:50:38.166 --> 00:50:40.500
With experience landing in Afghanistan.

855
00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:43.750
That's good. He can handle
the short, snowy runway in the Alps.

856
00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:49.041
Camila, that's when you deploy the drone
to Zurich, and you follow us to Cortina.

857
00:50:50.666 --> 00:50:53.000
<i>Magnus, need you
to keep an eye on the clock.</i>

858
00:50:53.666 --> 00:50:55.833
<i>You got ten minutes
once you start on that safe.</i>

859
00:50:55.916 --> 00:50:57.750
- 11:55!
- So close!

860
00:50:58.375 --> 00:51:00.458
When we land,
Harry's guys'll be on the ground

861
00:51:00.541 --> 00:51:03.000
<i>to offload the gold
onto a train by the landing strip.</i>

862
00:51:03.083 --> 00:51:05.000
<i>At the next station,</i>

863
00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:09.291
<i>Interpol will be waiting
to receive our half billion in gold.</i>

864
00:51:09.375 --> 00:51:10.458
Boo.

865
00:51:13.666 --> 00:51:15.625
I like this one.

881
00:51:49.958 --> 00:51:51.416
Oh my God!

882
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.333
If it was in a movie, it would go like,
"Hey, let's steal a plane!"

883
00:51:54.416 --> 00:51:56.642
You'd put your hand in,
and people would be like... "Ah!"

884
00:51:56.666 --> 00:51:58.208
Stop doing that!

885
00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:00.708
- Honestly, it's just awkward.
- It felt like the moment.

886
00:52:00.791 --> 00:52:01.916
Read the room.

887
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.375
So how stealth is it, exactly?

888
00:52:04.458 --> 00:52:05.875
To a radar,

889
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.000
it will be like a small bird.

890
00:52:09.083 --> 00:52:10.958
Practically undetectable.

891
00:52:11.041 --> 00:52:13.875
I don't think I want
Mollsen to have that capability.

892
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:19.416
- So you think you can fly it?
- I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

893
00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:24.500
Rest up.
Tomorrow's the biggest lift of our lives.

894
00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:45.375
This is the outfit you chose?

895
00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:48.666
This is what I'm wearing
for this incredibly serious operation?

896
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:51.208
Jorgensen is gonna have guys on the plane.

897
00:52:52.666 --> 00:52:55.458
Sometimes the best way
to blend in is to stand out.

898
00:52:55.541 --> 00:52:58.125
Nobody's gonna suspect
the rich douche and his trophy wife

899
00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:00.333
sitting in first class, sipping champagne.

900
00:53:00.416 --> 00:53:02.666
Oh, is calling me a trophy wife
your idea of flattery?

901
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:03.750
No.

902
00:53:04.375 --> 00:53:06.000
Calling you my wife was.

Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard Sky Suisse flight 1412

915
00:54:16.958 --> 00:54:19.125
with service
to Zurich International Airport

916
00:54:19.208 --> 00:54:20.625
continuing to Melbourne.

917
00:54:20.708 --> 00:54:24.000
- All carry-on items should now be stowed...
- You nervous?

918
00:54:25.041 --> 00:54:26.958
Right now? Very much so.

919
00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:30.208
- You?
- No.

920
00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:32.041
I love every second of this.

921
00:54:33.583 --> 00:54:35.041
Is everybody in position?

922
00:54:36.166 --> 00:54:37.291
I'm all set.

923
00:54:37.375 --> 00:54:40.208
Never better.

924
00:54:43.041 --> 00:54:44.083
Good to go.

925
00:54:44.166 --> 00:54:45.625
Luke, what about you?

926
00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:49.291
Luke?

927
00:54:50.708 --> 00:54:52.916
Did anybody see Luke get on the plane?

928
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.666
Luke, where are you, buddy?

929
00:55:03.875 --> 00:55:05.291
I'm sorry. I, uh...

930
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.208
I couldn't do it.

931
00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:10.041
<i>It's just not worth the risk.</i>

932
00:55:10.625 --> 00:55:11.625
We lost Luke.

933
00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:15.250
All good. I'll see you on the other side.

934
00:55:16.791 --> 00:55:17.833
Sorry, boss.

935
00:55:17.916 --> 00:55:20.041
No worries.

936
00:55:24.041 --> 00:55:26.041
Mi-Sun, how bad is this gonna hurt us?

937
00:55:26.625 --> 00:55:28.500
Luke had the signal booster,

938
00:55:28.583 --> 00:55:32.583
so the PSID will still work,
but only if it's close to the cockpit.

939
00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:33.541
How close?

940
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:35.166
Mm, thirty feet?

941
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.833
Someone has to go to the coach bathroom,
where the pieces are,

942
00:55:37.916 --> 00:55:39.833
and take 'em to the first-class bathroom?

943
00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:40.916
<i>Yeah.</i>

944
00:55:41.625 --> 00:55:42.625
I'll do it.

945
00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:46.125
Are you sure you want to take this on?

946
00:55:46.916 --> 00:55:47.916
Yeah.

947
00:55:49.291 --> 00:55:51.833
All right, Mi-Sun,
Abby's gonna handle the PSID.

948
00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:53.666
You just gotta tell her how it works.

949
00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:13.458
Okay.

950
00:56:24.875 --> 00:56:27.166
Guys, we've got eyes on us.

951
00:56:28.333 --> 00:56:30.458
Two in first class.

952
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.833
Three in economy.

953
00:56:39.833 --> 00:56:43.375
<i>Copy that. Keep your eyes open
in case they make a move.</i>

954
00:57:05.125 --> 00:57:08.208
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have reached cruising altitude.</i>

955
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:10.333
<i>You are free to move about the cabin.</i>

956
00:57:22.166 --> 00:57:23.208
Game on.

957
00:57:26.708 --> 00:57:27.583
Just in time.

958
00:57:27.666 --> 00:57:29.708
We should be over the English Channel now.

959
00:57:33.041 --> 00:57:37.000
{\an8}Victor Sierra 14-12,
Brussels, continue at 34,000,

960
00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:40.416
and expect slight turbulence going
over the top of the mountains.

961
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.291
There's a low-pressure system forming.

962
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.166
Copy that, control.

963
00:58:05.708 --> 00:58:06.833
Here you are.

964
00:58:12.375 --> 00:58:14.125
Abby, you're up.

965
00:58:15.208 --> 00:58:17.708
Ten minutes till we rendezvous
with Camila.

966
00:58:17.791 --> 00:58:19.666
- You sure you're up for this?
- Yeah.

967
00:58:20.333 --> 00:58:21.333
I'm going in.

968
00:58:36.125 --> 00:58:39.875
<i>This is the captain speaking.
We're approaching a low-pressure system.</i>

969
00:58:39.958 --> 00:58:42.083
<i>Could give us
a little turbulence up ahead.</i>

970
00:58:42.166 --> 00:58:45.291
<i>For your safety, I've turned on
the fasten seatbelt sign.</i>

971
00:59:14.458 --> 00:59:15.625
Shit!

972
00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:17.166
No, no! No, no, no!

973
00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:25.125
Here we go.

974
00:59:32.583 --> 00:59:34.250
Abby, it's me.

975
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.083
Baby, I need your help in here.

976
00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:43.125
What did you do?

977
00:59:43.208 --> 00:59:47.583
- Tell me you know how to help me fix this!
- Shit! I don't know. I think so.

978
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.833
<i>Abby, what's going on?</i>

979
00:59:49.916 --> 00:59:53.666
We're running out of time.
Camila's almost on our tail.

980
00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:57.708
Hurry up, eh? Come on.

981
01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:02.375
Um...

982
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.916
Oh yeah, baby!

983
01:00:09.791 --> 01:00:11.041
Oh yeah!

984
01:00:13.625 --> 01:00:16.958
<i>Traffic!
Traffic! Traffic! Traffic!</i>

985
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.666
<i>Traffic!</i>

986
01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:37.208
Keep going!

987
01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:41.416
- All right, how long until the switch?
- A minute, 30 seconds.

988
01:00:41.916 --> 01:00:44.791
<i>Descend! Descend!</i>

989
01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:47.291
Come on.

990
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.583
<i>Descend!
Descend!</i>

991
01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:05.333
<i>Descend!</i>

992
01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:17.916
<i>Descend! Descend!</i>

993
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.750
<i>Descend! Descend!</i>

994
01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:25.750
<i>Descend! Descend!</i>

995
01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:29.250
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no...

996
01:01:45.041 --> 01:01:47.291
Oh shit. Come on. Come on.

997
01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:50.625
Almost there. Almost there, baby.
Don't stop!

998
01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.750
<i>Pardon,</i> Harry,
are you seeing this?

999
01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:55.083
What?

1000
01:01:55.166 --> 01:01:58.208
The... the board
is showing <i>two</i> Victor Sierra 14-12s.

1001
01:01:58.291 --> 01:02:01.208
Oh, it's probably just a glitch.
Happens every now and then.

1002
01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:03.083
I have never seen this before.

1003
01:02:04.708 --> 01:02:06.500
Are you going to notify Jean-Pierre?

1004
01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:08.583
Sandra, I'm gonna have
to start reporting this

1005
01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:10.666
relentless undermining behavior to HR.

1006
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:13.958
- What?
- You think I'm unable to do my job.

1007
01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:15.458
Is it 'cause of the chair?

1008
01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:17.541
What? No!

1009
01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:19.875
'Cause your constant challenging
of my decision-making,

1010
01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:24.750
it... it makes me feel attacked
and... and, frankly, unsafe.

1011
01:02:27.791 --> 01:02:29.208
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1012
01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:32.708
There. See?

1013
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
You really should look

1014
01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:41.500
at your unexamined prejudices,
Sandra, yeah?

1015
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.541
- Okay.
- Course. Off you pop.

1016
01:02:53.083 --> 01:02:54.458
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1017
01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:04.375
Now it's real.

1018
01:03:09.125 --> 01:03:10.166
Excuse me.

1019
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:11.250
Wow.

1020
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:14.916
- All yours, big guy.
- Mm.

1021
01:03:21.416 --> 01:03:24.625
Harry, I just wanted to say
I'm so sorry about before.

1022
01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:27.125
- Were you getting a coffee?
- No. But I could!

1023
01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:29.458
Cappuccino, please. From the good place.

1024
01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:32.226
- Where is the good place?
- Kind of busy, Sandra.

1025
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.291
Oh, okay.

1026
01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.291
Victor Sierra, 14-12. Control.

1027
01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:44.333
<i>This is Victor Sierra, 14-12.</i>

1028
01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:50.625
We have an AWOS warning
coming out of Zurich.

1029
01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:54.166
High winds, extreme weather,
low visibility and falling.

1030
01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:55.458
Flooding on the runway.

1031
01:03:55.541 --> 01:04:00.125
<i>Zurich tower is diverting all
inbound traffic to the nearest airport.</i>

1032
01:04:00.208 --> 01:04:02.458
Copy that, control.
Yeah. We just felt a few bumps.

1033
01:04:02.541 --> 01:04:03.833
Which airport would that be?

1034
01:04:06.416 --> 01:04:09.208
Please proceed to Charlie Delta Foxtrot.

1035
01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:12.833
Short runway, but it shouldn't be
too challenging for a pilot of your skill.

1036
01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:19.041
<i>Copy that, control.</i>

1037
01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:20.916
<i>Proceeding as directed.</i>

1038
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.583
<i>Victor Sierra 14-12.</i>

1039
01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:25.416
Set course to Cortina.

1040
01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:29.250
Control to Victor Sierra 14-12.

1041
01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.000
VS 14-12, go ahead.

1042
01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:34.500
You are clear for deployment.

1043
01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:35.583
<i>Roger that.</i>

1044
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.500
<i>Okay, boss.</i>

1045
01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:51.208
<i>The drone is heading to Zurich.</i>

1046
01:04:51.291 --> 01:04:52.541
<i>See you in Cortina.</i>

1047
01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:56.541
<i>Victor Sierra 14-12,</i>

1048
01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:58.833
<i>confirming your approach
to Zurich is on course.</i>

1049
01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:07.958
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

1050
01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:12.041
<i>Unfortunately, the weather in Zurich
has taken a severe turn.</i>

1051
01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:15.958
<i>We've been instructed to land
in Cortina, the nearest airport.</i>

1052
01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:29.083
Denton, Magnus, it's vault time.

1053
01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:32.250
<i>Our friends are getting restless,
but we gotta stick to the clock.</i>

1054
01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:37.333
Miss!

1055
01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.208
I was wondering if you could...

1056
01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:43.000
Well, I'm having trouble
with the flight entertainment.

1057
01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:45.500
Of course, sir.
It's a bit tricky, isn't it?

1058
01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:47.250
I was wondering if it's this button.

1059
01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:49.958
- Yes. This button, right here.
- Course.

1060
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:51.750
This button here?

1061
01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:54.125
There you go.
Then you just pick and choose...

1062
01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:55.208
There you go!

1063
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.166
Is that okay?

1064
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.333
This is wonderful.

1065
01:05:57.416 --> 01:05:59.416
I think I'll watch me a movie
or something.

1066
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.500
Wonderful!

1067
01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:08.458
<i>All right, Mi-Sun, you're up.</i>

1068
01:06:08.541 --> 01:06:11.000
- Okay.
<i>- Lock down outside communications.</i>

1069
01:06:11.958 --> 01:06:14.291
Cutting off the Wi-Fi now.

1070
01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:25.958
Excuse me,
there's no vaping on the flight.

1071
01:06:26.041 --> 01:06:29.208
Look at that. You caught me.
I wouldn't dream of it.

1072
01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:34.083
I'll take these.

1073
01:06:34.875 --> 01:06:35.875
Thank you.

1074
01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:49.125
<i>We apologize
for the interruption with the Wi-Fi.</i>

1075
01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:50.916
<i>We are working to correct the problem.</i>

1076
01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:14.750
Mi-Sun, how's the door sensor?

1077
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:17.166
You're good to go.

1078
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.333
<i>Just be careful of that pressure variance.</i>

1079
01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:21.333
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mom.

1080
01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:31.791
Showtime.

1081
01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:38.625
Showtime?

1082
01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.458
It's supposed to be cool. Showtime!

1083
01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:44.458
Show...

1084
01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:11.083
Shit.

1085
01:08:36.375 --> 01:08:38.375
I'm sorry, sir,
but you'll have to take your seat.

1086
01:08:38.458 --> 01:08:39.750
<i>Sláinte.</i>

1087
01:08:39.833 --> 01:08:40.958
Sir!

1088
01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:44.958
We're landing in Zurich.

1089
01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:49.083
All right, page the captain.

1090
01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:51.541
Tell him we got a medical emergency. Oi?

1091
01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:52.875
They won't open the door.

1092
01:08:52.958 --> 01:08:55.833
They will when they know
you're the one with the emergency.

1093
01:08:55.916 --> 01:08:57.083
Trying to get in the cockpit.

1094
01:09:01.833 --> 01:09:04.083
We gotta buy Magnus some time.

1095
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.666
Cyrus!

1096
01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:08.750
Come on!

1097
01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:16.416
Shit!

1098
01:10:26.416 --> 01:10:27.416
Yes!

1099
01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:49.833
Come on. We gotta go check on Magnus.

1100
01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:56.041
Gear down.

1101
01:11:00.583 --> 01:11:02.791
<i>Flight attendants,
get everyone to their seats.</i>

1102
01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:07.458
About to check on the gold, were we?

1103
01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:26.375
Ah!

1104
01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:17.416
Okay. Yes.

1105
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.708
- They got the vault open, but that's it.
- Did you check it?

1106
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:23.458
Cyrus, I was so close. I'm sorry.

1107
01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:24.791
You did good, buddy.

1108
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.750
See, Cormac. We did you proud!

1109
01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:31.916
Oh, you think that, do you?

1110
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.375
You think Jorgensen's gonna be proud
of this?!

1111
01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.250
Yes, sir?

1112
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Cormac, I've just had a phone call
from my men at Zurich airport.

1113
01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.333
And you know what they told me?

1114
01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:49.375
<i>A drone landed in Zurich.</i>

1115
01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:51.666
It's under control, sir.

1116
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:54.791
Team of thieves tried to jack the payload,
but we took 'em down.

1117
01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:57.083
- The gold's all here.
- Where is "here"?

1118
01:12:57.166 --> 01:12:58.958
<i>It's a small airstrip in the Alps.</i>

1119
01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:01.166
These amateurs provided a second plane.

1120
01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:03.958
Who are they?

1121
01:13:04.041 --> 01:13:07.541
<i>Just some small-time crooks
trying to make a name for themselves.</i>

1122
01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.750
Then I can help them.

1123
01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:13.166
<i>Bring the thieves and the gold to me here.</i>

1124
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:14.500
You have an hour.

1125
01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:18.976
- Come!
- All right.

1126
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.760
- No, no, no...
- Let's go.

1127
01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:26.000
What happened?

1128
01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:28.666
You're working for me now.
We're flying to Tuscany.

1129
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:32.000
- It's just a little detour. That's all.
- Shut up. You're coming with me.

1130
01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:34.250
- It's not a smart move.
- Interpol knows where we are.

1131
01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:36.291
- They'll follow us.
- Not if they can't see us.

1132
01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:39.708
We were tracking the Airbus the whole way,
and we didn't see this jet.

1133
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.791
So neither will your friends.

1134
01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.125
Get the gold on board.

1135
01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:48.291
Wait. Wait, no.
The jet can't take that much weight.

1136
01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:50.083
That's why we got the trains.

1137
01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:52.583
It's at the end of the runway.
Look, if you don't believe us,

1138
01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:54.416
send one of your guys so they can see.

1139
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.458
Well, I'll take my chances with the jet,
but we'll lighten the load.

1140
01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:59.375
Dispose of him.

1141
01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:03.500
- No. Wait. Wait. Hey! Hey! Hey!
- You two, let's go.

1142
01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:04.583
Let's go!

1143
01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:09.333
{\an8}Sir! Sir?

1144
01:14:09.416 --> 01:14:10.416
Huh?

1145
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.833
- We just got word from Brussels.
- Uh-huh?

1146
01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:16.291
There was an attempt
to breach the plane's cockpit.

1147
01:14:16.833 --> 01:14:18.208
Okay, go on.

1148
01:14:18.291 --> 01:14:19.791
Passengers intervened,

1149
01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:23.916
then they forced a couple passengers
onto a private jet.

1150
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.250
- Well, where's the jet now?
- We are having trouble tracking it, sir.

1151
01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:29.916
Then what are you doing standing here?
Go find it!

1152
01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:49.000
You strapped in tight?

1153
01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:53.791
Yes.

1154
01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:55.583
Good.

1155
01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:12.208
What the hell was that?

1156
01:15:12.291 --> 01:15:14.375
- Answer him.
- It's the gold!

1157
01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:16.750
It's throwing us off balance. I told you.

1158
01:15:16.833 --> 01:15:18.250
She's not done.

1159
01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:26.583
She's shaking off the stealth mods,
isn't she?

1160
01:15:26.666 --> 01:15:27.666
She sure is.

1161
01:15:49.833 --> 01:15:50.750
<i>Keep it moving!</i>

1162
01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:53.309
Yeah. I'm just not really a gun guy,
so I get a little nervous.

1163
01:15:53.333 --> 01:15:55.684
I mean, you can have
your Second Amendment rights. Do you...

1164
01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:56.809
- Stop talking!
- Okay.

1165
01:15:56.833 --> 01:15:59.583
- Stop talking. Just keep walking.
- Okay. That is a cool gun.

1166
01:15:59.666 --> 01:16:02.083
I'm guessing the barrel
is carbon nanofiber

1167
01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:04.250
harvested from a vape pen
with liquid propellant.

1168
01:16:04.333 --> 01:16:05.250
That is awesome.

1169
01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:07.833
- Turn around!
- Okay! Okay. Okay.

1170
01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:11.000
Jesus!

1171
01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:14.000
I don't do guns!

1172
01:16:16.916 --> 01:16:19.142
I'm sorry about the nose,
but we're cool, right?

1173
01:16:19.166 --> 01:16:20.666
I'll go my way, you go yours.

1174
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:22.833
Okay. I'm good.

1175
01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:31.583
Oh!

1176
01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:32.666
That's...

1177
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:33.583
Okay.

1178
01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:35.625
You should probably call a doctor!

1179
01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:38.875
We have located the jet, sir.
It's headed toward Italy.

1180
01:16:38.958 --> 01:16:40.758
Doesn't Jorgensen
have property here?

1181
01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:43.833
Yes, there's a villa
under a shell company in Tuscany.

1182
01:16:43.916 --> 01:16:45.625
Should we send in the Carabinieri?

1183
01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:47.708
We don't have
hard evidence on him yet.

1184
01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:52.041
Get me a line to NATO.
I'll tell them we have an unidentified jet

1185
01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:54.791
that's a terrorist threat,
and we need to shoot them down.

1186
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:57.708
But Agent Gladwell could be on it.

1187
01:16:57.791 --> 01:17:00.375
We can't risk
Jorgensen getting that gold.

1188
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:02.791
Get me NATO.

1189
01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:19.666
{\an8}Copy. NFR 180, proceed
to waypoint to confirm visual.

1190
01:17:24.041 --> 01:17:28.208
Oh, Leviathan. Welcome.
Nice to meet some of you in person.

1191
01:17:28.916 --> 01:17:30.125
Where is the gold?

1192
01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:32.625
Ah.

1193
01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:38.500
Leviathan didn't send me here
for small talk.

1194
01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:42.208
My colleague in Zurich
says your plane did not land.

1195
01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:45.791
That was our plan
to distract the authorities.

1196
01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:47.750
The gold will arrive here.

1197
01:17:47.833 --> 01:17:51.541
Well, I hope so. We don't want
to have to empty all your bank accounts.

1198
01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.458
What do you mean?

1199
01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:58.333
The Caymans, Monaco, Panama,
Switzerland, Singapore, and the Maldives.

1200
01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:00.125
We know where your money is.

1201
01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:03.750
And we can make it
all disappear in seconds.

1202
01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.208
That's why we only deal in gold.

1203
01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:08.625
Unhackable,

1204
01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:10.541
untraceable.

1205
01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.333
It will be here within an hour.

1206
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.250
Oh shit.

1207
01:18:26.666 --> 01:18:27.958
Get me NATO.

1208
01:18:38.791 --> 01:18:40.791
<i>This is NATO First Response.</i>

1209
01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:43.791
<i>I say again, this is NATO First Response.</i>

1210
01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:48.375
<i>You are in direct violation
of civilian aviation regulations.</i>

1211
01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:50.833
<i>Identify, or we will engage with force.</i>

1212
01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:53.208
<i>- Civilian aircraft...</i>
- Don't answer.

1213
01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:54.291
<i>I say again,</i>

1214
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.250
<i>you are in direct violation
of civilian aviation regulations.</i>

1215
01:18:59.333 --> 01:19:01.583
<i>Establish radio contact immediately,</i>

1216
01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:04.916
or you will be fired upon
with live ordnance.

1217
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.708
November Foxtrot Romeo 180,
please be advised,

1218
01:19:07.791 --> 01:19:09.500
you're tracking a private aircraft.

1219
01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:13.250
<i>There are civilians on board.
Repeat, there are civilians on board.</i>

1220
01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:16.291
<i>NFR to Commander Huxley.</i>

1221
01:19:16.375 --> 01:19:19.750
<i>We have unconfirmed reports
of civilians on board.</i>

1222
01:19:19.833 --> 01:19:20.833
Say again.

1223
01:19:20.916 --> 01:19:24.333
Unconfirmed from Brussels ATC,
civilians on the aircraft.

1224
01:19:24.416 --> 01:19:27.500
<i>Repeated attempts to contact
have been met with radio silence.</i>

1225
01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:28.708
<i>Please advise.</i>

1226
01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:31.750
Look, we don't know
if they're on that plane.

1227
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.083
If that plane makes it,
then people <i>are</i> gonna die.

1228
01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:37.083
<i>We can't let Leviathan get that gold.
Do you hear me?</i>

1229
01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:39.559
Whatever they're planning
is bigger and deadlier than Madrid,

1230
01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:40.916
and we can't risk it.

1231
01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:43.666
<i>What's your order,
Commander?</i>

1232
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.708
Shoot it down.

1233
01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:51.875
<i>Copy.
NFR 180, continue to attempt contact.</i>

1234
01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:54.916
<i>If unresponsive, commence
60-second warning on aircraft.</i>

1235
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.666
Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit.

1236
01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:00.000
- They're gonna shoot us down.
- They're bluffing!

1237
01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:01.291
Systems armed.

1238
01:20:06.375 --> 01:20:07.791
Weapons hot.

1239
01:20:07.875 --> 01:20:10.375
<i>Unidentified aircraft, be advised.</i>

1240
01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:17.333
<i>You have 60 seconds
to establish radio contact on 132.175.</i>

1241
01:20:30.833 --> 01:20:32.833
Abby! "Ball so hard!"

1242
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:40.791
<i>Twenty seconds!</i>

1243
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.083
<i>Ten seconds!</i>

1244
01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:58.458
Oh my God!

1245
01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:07.000
Control, we have contact.
Civilian hostages on board.

1246
01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:08.791
That's what I've been saying!

1247
01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:10.083
<i>Please advise.</i>

1248
01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:13.583
NFR 180, stand down. Repeat, stand down.

1249
01:21:13.666 --> 01:21:17.125
<i>Commander Huxley, we have confirmation
of civilians on board.</i>

1250
01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:18.408
We're tracking the flight now,

1251
01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:21.416
and we'll notify the local authorities
upon its descent and landing.

1252
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:23.250
Copy.

1253
01:21:25.333 --> 01:21:27.208
<i>Stand down and break off.</i>

1254
01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:29.791
<i>Repeat, standing down and breaking off.</i>

1255
01:21:30.333 --> 01:21:32.125
Yes! Yes!

1256
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.041
Make sure she lands the damn plane!

1257
01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:58.291
Right the plane!

1258
01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:07.125
Sorry about that.

1259
01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:24.833
- Take it down! Now!
- Okay! I'm sorry.

1260
01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:38.291
Get the remote!

1261
01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:48.583
Hit it now!

1262
01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:56.375
Bang-bang.

1263
01:22:57.125 --> 01:22:58.791
We gotta get to the cockpit!

1264
01:23:03.958 --> 01:23:06.833
Grab him! I can't fly.

1265
01:23:06.916 --> 01:23:07.791
My wrist!

1266
01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:11.208
Okay, switch. Switch. Switch.

1267
01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:13.333
Camila, tell us what to do!

1268
01:23:13.416 --> 01:23:16.250
Pull up! Pull up!
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!

1269
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.625
Okay. You okay?

1270
01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:30.708
I'm loving every second
of this.

1271
01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:36.708
What was that? What just happened?

1272
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:43.166
<i>- No!
- What happened?</i>

1273
01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:46.208
- Camila!
- What just happened?

1274
01:23:46.958 --> 01:23:49.458
- We lost the hydraulic pump!
- What does that mean?

1275
01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:51.291
Steering is almost impossible.

1276
01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:54.541
<i>We've got to land now,
or we'll lose control!</i>

1277
01:23:56.375 --> 01:23:59.875
I'm gonna try to steer us
using the engines. Yeah!

1278
01:24:03.375 --> 01:24:05.041
That's Jorgensen's compound.

1279
01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:09.041
No, no, no. We're coming in too fast!
We can't make the landing strip!

1280
01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:10.791
We're gonna have to use the road.

1281
01:24:12.291 --> 01:24:15.333
There's your gold, right on time.

1282
01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:19.000
We're coming in hot!

1283
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:26.083
Pull up! Give it everything you have!
Pull up! Pull up!

1284
01:24:59.708 --> 01:25:01.458
I can't believe it.

1285
01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:03.250
We did it.

1286
01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:05.458
<i>We did it.</i>

1287
01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:06.541
Yeah.

1288
01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:11.250
We successfully landed the gold
on Jorgensen's estate.

1289
01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:15.750
Ah.

1290
01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:19.458
Out!

1291
01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:24.458
Let's go!

1292
01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:30.416
Remember Venice?

1293
01:25:31.375 --> 01:25:32.416
Of course.

1294
01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:36.208
<i>Why are you bringing up Venice now, Cyrus?</i>

1295
01:25:40.458 --> 01:25:42.833
God, I really loved that NFT.

1296
01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:44.750
Yeah.

1297
01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:47.208
Now, Mi-Sun, you know what we need to do.

1298
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.750
<i>- Follow Cyrus's lead.</i>
- I'm on it.

1299
01:25:51.541 --> 01:25:55.958
Cormac? Where is Cormac?

1300
01:25:56.666 --> 01:25:57.916
Cormac didn't make it.

1301
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:00.333
Who the hell are you?

1302
01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:05.041
- Get the boats ready.
- It's, uh, Leviathan, right?

1303
01:26:06.916 --> 01:26:11.250
- What is going on?
- I assure you, all is under control.

1304
01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:13.666
I'm not gonna ask you again.

1305
01:26:14.416 --> 01:26:16.375
- Who are you?
- Interpol.

1306
01:26:16.458 --> 01:26:19.000
Just got this. One of them is Interpol!

1307
01:26:23.041 --> 01:26:25.291
This is over. We're out.

1308
01:26:27.666 --> 01:26:31.666
That was a clean shot through your leg
so you can still type on your computer.

1309
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:33.916
Next shot, no more typing.

1310
01:26:34.666 --> 01:26:36.375
Do we still have a deal?

1311
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:46.166
As you can see,
I don't like to repeat myself, so...

1312
01:26:46.708 --> 01:26:49.083
Which one of you is Interpol?

1313
01:26:56.333 --> 01:26:57.333
It's me.

1314
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:01.208
It's me. I'm Interpol.

1315
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.583
Agent Gladwell.

1316
01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:08.541
These are just civilians that your guys
took hostage. You can let them go.

1317
01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:12.250
Say goodbye, Agent Gladwell.

1318
01:27:13.833 --> 01:27:16.000
Huh?

1319
01:27:22.166 --> 01:27:25.583
Hands up, guns down!

1320
01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:28.625
Hands up!

1321
01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:31.041
Agent Gladwell, Interpol.

1322
01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:35.666
She's been shot!

1323
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.250
It was him!

1324
01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:42.416
These people are intruders.

1325
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.333
I was defending my property.

1326
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:47.291
Now, hold on.

1327
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.750
You collect art, right?

1328
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:53.250
NFTs.

1329
01:27:53.333 --> 01:27:56.000
You know, some people
say that they're a passing fad.

1330
01:27:57.375 --> 01:28:00.125
I say that all art
just depends on the artist.

1331
01:28:05.333 --> 01:28:06.333
Mi-Sun, play it.

1332
01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:07.916
My pleasure.

1333
01:28:30.208 --> 01:28:31.708
Enjoy prison.

1334
01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:33.892
- Let's go.
- Move!

1335
01:28:33.916 --> 01:28:35.041
Wait!

1336
01:28:39.458 --> 01:28:41.583
Well done, Mi-Sun.

1337
01:28:42.916 --> 01:28:44.500
Bloody hell!

1338
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:57.125
Agent Gladwell!

1339
01:29:06.833 --> 01:29:08.250
Agent Gladwell.

1340
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:10.833
I guess we're done.

1341
01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:21.375
Thanks for the backup, Stefano.

1342
01:29:24.166 --> 01:29:26.041
Listen to me. Do you understand?

1343
01:29:29.166 --> 01:29:33.208
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't sure you were going to make it.

1344
01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:35.083
Neither was I.

1345
01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.708
Abby, the NATO jets
were this close.

1346
01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:42.041
Let's go.

1347
01:29:44.416 --> 01:29:45.416
Yeah.

1348
01:29:45.958 --> 01:29:47.416
Thank God Huxley stopped them.

1349
01:29:51.583 --> 01:29:54.583
It <i>was</i> Huxley that stopped them, right?

1350
01:29:58.416 --> 01:29:59.500
Stefano?

1351
01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:08.625
Abby, let me explain.

1352
01:30:11.375 --> 01:30:12.375
No need.

1353
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.208
I quit.

1354
01:30:39.791 --> 01:30:40.916
You need a lift?

1355
01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:50.416
<i>♪ So you come a long way ♪</i>

1356
01:30:52.583 --> 01:30:55.458

1360
01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:06.625
Where are we?

1361
01:31:07.541 --> 01:31:08.916
You'll see.

1362
01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.791
You know, I didn't trust Huxley.

1363
01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:16.625
You were obviously right about that.

1364
01:31:16.708 --> 01:31:18.083
But I've always trusted you.

1365
01:31:18.916 --> 01:31:20.333
That was never in question.

1366
01:31:22.583 --> 01:31:25.583
You know, in Paris,
our first week...

1367
01:31:25.666 --> 01:31:28.041
...I didn't fall in love with the cover.

1368
01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:32.000
I fell in love with the way
you looked at the art,

1369
01:31:32.083 --> 01:31:35.208
the way that you cared about
something that wasn't even yours.

1370
01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:40.541
Losing you during that week
was the stupidest thing I've ever done

1371
01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:43.166
in a lifetime full of stupid things.

1372
01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.833
I don't want to lose you again.

1373
01:31:49.583 --> 01:31:52.208
So, I got you something.

1374
01:31:54.250 --> 01:31:55.458
Mm.

1375
01:32:01.708 --> 01:32:02.958
"Liam Dower"?

1376
01:32:04.291 --> 01:32:07.291
Liam Dower stole
your mother's Hockney print.

1377
01:32:08.208 --> 01:32:09.208
What?

1378
01:32:10.416 --> 01:32:12.583
- How did you...
- I asked around.

1379
01:32:13.083 --> 01:32:15.958
I found him, found out
who he sold it to, and I bought it.

1380
01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:20.208
You bought it?

1381
01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:22.125
For your school.

1382
01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:31.000
Now, I want you
to hold on to that feeling.

1383
01:32:31.083 --> 01:32:32.958
Like, hold it. Because there's more.

1384
01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:35.333
Another little thing.

1385
01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:38.458
A little something.
There's a little more. Um...

1386
01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:40.916
We stole the gold.

1387
01:32:41.875 --> 01:32:43.500
- What?
- Yeah.

1388
01:32:43.583 --> 01:32:46.583
- How?
- Okay, the first part, you knew about.

1389
01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:50.250
<i>The part of the plan
you didn't know about,</i>

1390
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.541
<i>while we recruited Harry in Brussels,</i>

1391
01:32:53.625 --> 01:32:56.333
<i>Magnus dipped hundreds
of iron bars in gold paint</i>

1392
01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:00.625
<i>which we sent
on our own crates via Sky Suisse cargo.</i>

1393
01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:04.166
On the plane,
while we were distracting the guys up top,

1394
01:33:06.541 --> 01:33:08.666
<i>Magnus waited
until the plane was on approach,</i>

1395
01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.041
<i>he swapped the crates.</i>

1396
01:33:13.208 --> 01:33:15.750
<i>We just had to guide
the real gold out the door.</i>

1397
01:33:18.666 --> 01:33:21.041
<i>And Luke?</i>

1398
01:33:21.125 --> 01:33:22.791
<i>He was never out.</i>

1399
01:33:22.875 --> 01:33:24.583
<i>He just had a different gig.</i>

1400
01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:28.583
And all he had to do
was guide it in for the safe landing.

1401
01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:30.541
So what did Huxley end up with?

1402
01:33:33.083 --> 01:33:34.083
<i>Homeboy?</i>

1403
01:33:35.708 --> 01:33:37.083
<i>He got nothing.</i>

1404
01:33:45.916 --> 01:33:48.250
Come on. Let's go meet the team.

1405
01:33:48.333 --> 01:33:50.500
Yeah!

1406
01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:52.291
Hey, hey, hey! Come here!

1407
01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:54.541
We did it!

1408
01:33:54.625 --> 01:33:56.666
Oh! Our little fighter pilot!

1409
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:58.875
- That's me!
- Hey, you did it!

1410
01:33:58.958 --> 01:34:00.250
No, <i>we.</i> We did it.

1411
01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:02.208
- Luke!
- 'Sup!

1412
01:34:06.833 --> 01:34:08.625
Do you want to do the honors?

1413
01:34:17.416 --> 01:34:20.083
Oh no, no.
I... I shouldn't even be here.

1414
01:34:20.166 --> 01:34:21.500
- Come on.
- You should.

1415
01:34:21.583 --> 01:34:23.434
- Come on.
- Do it. I'll do it.

1416
01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:24.666
Do it.

1417
01:34:27.041 --> 01:34:28.833
- Yeah!
- Right there.

1418
01:34:28.916 --> 01:34:31.583
Yeah.

1419
01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.083
Whoo.

1420
01:34:46.458 --> 01:34:48.666
Here it is!

1421
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:50.500
Oh.

1422
01:34:50.583 --> 01:34:52.125
It worked. It worked.

1423
01:34:52.708 --> 01:34:54.458
Does it always feel this good?

1424
01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:58.291
It's never been this good.

1425
01:35:04.083 --> 01:35:05.708
Magnus, stop.

1426
01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:10.583
Welcome to the team, Agent Gladwell.

1427
01:35:12.125 --> 01:35:13.125
Oh please.

1428
01:35:13.916 --> 01:35:14.916
Call me Abby.

1429
01:35:17.083 --> 01:35:18.375
- Hey!
- Hey!

1430
01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:20.739
- Welcome, Abby.
- That's a good job, guys!

1431
01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:22.208
- Come on.
- All right.

1432
01:35:24.125 --> 01:35:26.375
- You get one. Just one.
- Yeah!

1433
01:35:26.958 --> 01:35:28.750
Oh!

1434
01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.625
Good. Can we get our gold?

1435
01:35:32.708 --> 01:35:34.500
- Yes!
- Let's get our gold!

1436
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.125
