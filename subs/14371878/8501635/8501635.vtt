348
00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:51.458
Arthur Tigue.

349
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.083
Now, Jorgensen's been paying Tigue
to work on something new.

350
00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:56.458
I caught him,
I turned him, and I got him to talk.

351
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:58.541
According to this weasel,

352
00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.750
Jorgensen's been chatting
with the hacker group Leviathan.

353
00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:02.750
Leviathan?

354
00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:05.333
[Huxley] They're planning some kind
of massive strike on water.

355
00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:08.166
Utilities, dams, it's all on the grid now.

356
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.041
They could flood a city.

357
00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.833
Dry up a whole country if they wanted.

358
00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:14.291
Millions could die.

359
00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:16.833
And Jorgensen would make billions off it.

360
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.333
He's been shorting stocks and utilities.

361
00:20:19.416 --> 00:20:21.375
We don't know when
or where he's gonna strike.

362
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:25.166
But what we do know is that
Leviathan want their payment in gold.

363
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.083
Half a billion dollars in gold,
to be precise.

364
00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:29.375
And Jorgensen is gonna move it

365
00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:32.500
from his vault
in London to Zurich in 17 days.

366
00:20:32.583 --> 00:20:35.833
- You can't intercept it because it's...
- Totally legal...

367
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:37.625
To move your own gold.

368
00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:44.958
No.

369
00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.541
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

370
00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:50.583
- [Huxley] You don't know what I'll ask.
- I do.

371
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.666
- You don't.
- You want Cyrus to nick the gold.

372
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.875
Well, I wouldn't have used
the word "nick," but...

373
00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:58.416
You want to rely on Cyrus Whitaker
for an operation of this scale?

374
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.791
Trust him with
half a billion dollars worth of gold?

375
00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:03.375
Yeah, why not?

376
00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:06.000
He's a thief,
a con man, a professional liar.

377
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:07.625
You cannot possibly trust him.

378
00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:09.833
I work in a building
with intelligence agents,

379
00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:12.500
and I don't trust any of them.
'Cause we're all liars. All of us.

380
00:21:12.583 --> 00:21:14.708
- What's another one?
- It is not the same thing.

381
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:17.791
Our job is to do things we don't like
and make calls we don't want,

382
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.375
so the rest of the world
can just carry on.

383
00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:23.791
What if he says no?

384
00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:26.208
It's your job to make sure
that doesn't happen.

385
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.250
[bright, energetic music playing]

386
00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:57.083
[exhales]

387
00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:01.000
Took you long enough.

388
00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:04.583
[elevator bell dings]

389
00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:06.791
[pop music playing on stereo]

390
00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:08.541
Can I get you a drink?

391
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:11.791
What is it? Tequila during the day,
vodka by night, right?

392
00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:14.333
- I'll get it.
- [chuckles]

393
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:16.416
All the good stuff is in the back.

394
00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:21.000
Yeah. But we wouldn't want you to take
all year to find it. Let me help you.

395
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.750
You look good.

396
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:27.541
[Abby clears throat]

397
00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:29.208
[chuckles]

398
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:33.125
You know, it is pretty funny
that the thing that got you busted

399
00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:34.208
was an NFT.

400
00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:38.333
A little tacky.

401
00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:42.291
Sometimes, you gotta roll with the times.
And stop, we didn't steal anything.

402
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:45.000
That NFT was
a completely legitimate transaction.

403
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.500
Right. Of course.

404
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:51.000
- [takes a deep breath] Am I in trouble?
- For stealing a Van Gogh?

405
00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:52.875
We caught your buyer.

406
00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:55.416
He gave up Denton, Luke, and Magnus.

407
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.541
That was real cute, by the way,
nicking the painting that was in the NFT.

408
00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:01.666
Thought you'd appreciate
the artistry involved.

409
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.750
You stole art, Cyrus. You didn't make it.

410
00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:04.916
[Cyrus grunts softly]

411
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.958
[takes a deep breath]

412
00:23:07.041 --> 00:23:08.750
Are you still pissed about Paris?

413
00:23:10.791 --> 00:23:13.000
- I'm not going to discuss that with you.
- No?

414
00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:15.375
- No.
- I was kind of hoping we could.

415
00:23:15.458 --> 00:23:19.375
- It was a mistake, okay? An accident.
- An accident? For a full week?

416
00:23:19.458 --> 00:23:21.541
It was five days, not a week!

417
00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:22.833
A business week.

418
00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:25.833
And if I'd have known
who you were, what you did,

419
00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:27.416
it would never have happened.

420
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.500
So, what about you?

421
00:23:28.583 --> 00:23:31.500
I mean, I thought I was going to dinner
with the curator of the Gagosian.

422
00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:33.125
- I was undercover.
- So was I.

423
00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:34.916
- Not the same.
- Agree to disagree.

424
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.875
We fell for the cover. That's it.

425
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:40.583
That's all it was.

426
00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.083
Okay, so what is this?

427
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.666
- Are you here to arrest me, Abby?
- Agent Gladwell.

428
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.583
Agent? [scoffs]

429
00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:49.708
And no.

430
00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:54.875
I have been ordered to offer you a deal.

431
00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:58.000
[laughs]

432
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.291
Wow.

433
00:23:59.791 --> 00:24:01.583
- That's gotta sting, huh?
- [sighs]

434
00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:03.166
Is that why you're so pissed?

435
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:04.958
What kind of deal?

436
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.000
We need you to steal something.

437
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:12.708
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Do me a favor. Say it again.

438
00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:16.875
- But slower. Say it slower this time.
- Gold. A lot of gold.

439
00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.875
Half a billion dollars' worth.

440
00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:22.625
What's the catch?

441
00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:26.250
The owner of the gold
is a man named Lars Jorgensen.

442
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.375
[Cyrus scoffs]

443
00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:28.875
You know him?

444
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.375
By reputation, yeah.

445
00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:35.083
There's some people you steal from,

446
00:24:35.166 --> 00:24:37.126
and there's some people
that you don't steal from.

447
00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:39.041
Lars Jorgensen kills both.

448
00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:41.375
It's a hard pass for me.

449
00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:46.416
We have you on the Van Gogh, Cyrus.

450
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.958
Denton will die in jail.

451
00:24:50.041 --> 00:24:54.416
If you do this,
it's full immunity for you and your crew.

452
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.541
All felonies wiped clean,
past and present.

453
00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:00.583
Camila hasn't seen
her family in eight years.

454
00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:03.208
Mi-Sun has a grandmother
who doesn't have long to live.

455
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:05.166
Luke gets to see his poodle again.

456
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.625
Magnus gets to go
to the Cajun Stage at Jazz Fest.

457
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:11.083
Denton gets to go home, and you...

458
00:25:11.791 --> 00:25:13.833
You get to do

459
00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:15.708
whatever it is you do

460
00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:19.416
without looking over
your shoulder all the time.

461
00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:23.375
- Where are you at in all this?
- What do you mean?

462
00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:25.041
What's your role in the operation?

463
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:27.166
This is my role.
I make you the offer, that's it.

464
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.416
No, no. If we're signing up for this,
then so are you.

465
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.875
Look, I know how these things work.
If Interpol's involved,

466
00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:36.041
that means as soon as things hit the fan
that we're left hung out to dry.

467
00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:38.750
But if you're with us,
then they can't do that.

468
00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:39.666
With you?

469
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.875
On the team.

470
00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.750
- Interpol would never allow it.
- So then ask them.

471
00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:46.708
No you, no deal.

472
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:49.291
You got 24 hours to respond,
Agent Gladwell.

473
00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:54.833
[smacks lips, sighs]

474
00:25:58.416 --> 00:26:00.208
[music fades]

475
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:01.333
[Camila] No.

476
00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:02.583
She's Interpol.

477
00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:06.375
- Are you crazy?
- Absolutely not. No disrespect, yeah?

478
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:07.875
- But no.
- It's a setup.

479
00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:10.500
It's a half a billion in gold.

480
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:13.541
- That we don't get to keep.
- Yeah, but we get to see it.

481
00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.958
What do you want me to say?

482
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:18.375
If we don't do this, we go to jail.
She has us on the Van Gogh.

483
00:26:18.458 --> 00:26:22.000
Plus, and not that this should sway
anyone, but it's about saving lives.

484
00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:24.250
- Saving lives. Lovely.
- Don't lead with that.

485
00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:27.041
- [Magnus] Boo!
- Oh no, no. No, no.

486
00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:28.541
[tuts] Uh-uh.

487
00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:31.541
I don't appreciate
the emotional blackmail, Cyrus.

488
00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:35.958
[tuts] This is not emotional blackmail.
This is <i>blackmail</i> blackmail.

489
00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:39.750
I just want to say
that I am liking the vibes here.

490
00:26:39.833 --> 00:26:42.250
I think they're good.
I think it's fun. I'm on board.

491
00:26:42.333 --> 00:26:44.250
Yeah. Of course you are.
Because you're crazy.

492
00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:45.625
[Magnus] We gotta stay positive.

493
00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:49.583
- Come on, you don't have to throw a no...
- Take a moment. Don't escalate it.

494
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:52.166
- Get out of here!
- [Magnus] You get outta here!

495
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.333
Tiny!

496
00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:55.833
- Hey! It's Oliver!
- [group laughs]

497
00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.333
Oliver!

498
00:26:58.125 --> 00:26:59.541
I love Oliver!

499
00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:05.208
Agent Gladwell,
I just wanted to introduce you to Oliver.

500
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:08.875
Wow, I have heard a lot about you.

501
00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:11.543
- [Magnus] Oliver's my favorite.
- [Mi-Sun] Steve?

502
00:27:11.583 --> 00:27:12.416
[Magnus] Scary.

503
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.541
All right, Agent Gladwell has the floor.
Let's give our attention.

504
00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:18.750
- [sighs] Why should we?
- Because she caught us.

505
00:27:21.375 --> 00:27:23.791
She knows what she's doing. Go ahead.

506
00:27:24.791 --> 00:27:25.791
Thank you.

507
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:28.458
Okay.

508
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:30.708
[screen whirs]

509
00:27:30.791 --> 00:27:34.291
So, 17 days from now,
Lars Jorgensen is moving

510
00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:38.208
half a billion dollars in gold bars
from his bank in London to Zurich.

511
00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:39.291
Nice.

512
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:42.625
[Abby] The bars will be packed
in a single four-foot square crate,

513
00:27:42.708 --> 00:27:44.916
total weight, ten tons,

514
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.416
then delivered by truck from the bank
to Heathrow under heavy guard

515
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.958
and loaded onto
a Sky Suisse passenger plane to Zurich.

516
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:55.958
So, somewhere between the Bank of London

517
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:59.958
and the runway in Zurich,
the gold needs to disappear.

518
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:03.458
Gold needs to disappear. Great.

519
00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:05.083
That gave me chills.

520
00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:10.000
Well, it's an exciting story. It's...

521
00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.250
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible.

522
00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:13.458
Oh, this is.

523
00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:16.208
Stay positive. We can do this.
Try it with me.

524
00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:18.291
[in Spanish]
What I can do is beat your ass.

525
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:19.375
Want your ass beat?

526
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:21.583
I can understand what you're saying.

527
00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:24.208
[in English] Come on. Stop.
Camila, I'm with you.

528
00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:25.708
I don't know if it's possible.

529
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:30.541
I don't like it any more than any of you,
but we know the rules to our game.

530
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:33.541
- When you're beat, what do you do?
- Accept defeat gracefully?

531
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:35.625
AKA you go to jail or...

532
00:28:35.708 --> 00:28:37.208
[group] Look for the nearest exit.

533
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:40.958
That's right! This is it. So we do it,
we do it well, and we get out.

534
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:42.833
Let's treat it like any other lift.

535
00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:45.000
Examine it from top to bottom,
find a weakness.

536
00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:47.041
If there's a way to do it, we find it.

537
00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:49.375
None of us want to go to jail.

538
00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:52.291
And we damn sure
don't want to piss off Lars Jorgensen.

540

541
00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:00.083
[tense music playing]

542
00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.333
Morning, Arthur.

543
00:29:01.916 --> 00:29:03.416
[Arthur groans]

544
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.791
So you didn't make it home
from the pub last night, then, eh?

545
00:29:06.875 --> 00:29:08.625

548
00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:17.375

00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:19.208
[dog growls]

550
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:20.291
[Arthur] Stop!

551
00:29:21.416 --> 00:29:22.500
[Cormac] Hey, Jorgensen,

552
00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:24.208
<i>you remember Arthur Tigue.</i>

553
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.375
He used to work for us.

554
00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:28.625
Yes. Mr. Tigue.

555
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.708
{\an8}I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person.

556
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:34.000
{\an8}I just arrived at my villa.

557
00:29:34.083 --> 00:29:35.583
<i>Please, sir! I'm sorry!</i>

558
00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:38.416
Stop begging. It'll just make him
more inclined to violence.

559
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.458
You were arrested last month
on smuggling charges.

560
00:29:42.541 --> 00:29:43.458
[dog barks]

561
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:45.958
And yet, here you are, a free man.

562
00:29:46.041 --> 00:29:46.875
It's odd.

563
00:29:46.958 --> 00:29:48.083
Very odd.

564
00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:50.458
<i>Interpol only knows half the story!</i>

565
00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:52.666
What about the other half?

566
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.625
<i>You should have kept your mouth shut.</i>

567
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:56.791
<i>Now we are going to shut it for you.</i>

568
00:29:56.875 --> 00:29:59.291
- [Arthur] No!
<i>- Cormac, feed the dog.</i>

569
00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:02.958
- [Arthur] No! Cormac, please!
- [barking and snarling]

570
00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:10.208
[mellow R&B playing on headphones]

571
00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:19.458
What are you doing?

572
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:21.666
I hope you know your team
have been working all night

573
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.041
and half the day
trying to figure this out.

574
00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:26.291
[Cyrus chuckles]

575
00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:27.958
The teachers hated you, didn't they?

576
00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:29.921
What? No. I was top of the class.
They loved me.

577
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.041
No. They had to pretend
to like students like you

578
00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:34.916
because, technically, you followed
all the rules and got good grades.

579
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.458
What's wrong with that?

580
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:37.541
It's boring.

581
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.208
Anybody can do what they're told.
Anybody can memorize facts.

582
00:30:42.291 --> 00:30:44.125
Anybody can shine an apple on their ass.

583
00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:47.375
And what were you like?
Class clown? Wiseass?

584
00:30:47.458 --> 00:30:48.583
I was the opposite.

585
00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:50.291
I was silent.

586
00:30:50.875 --> 00:30:53.000
I was watching the kids
look at the blackboard,

587
00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:55.875
answering the questions
where they thought they should answer.

588
00:30:55.958 --> 00:30:57.541
I never looked at the blackboard.

589
00:30:58.375 --> 00:31:01.083
I was looking at the questions
that weren't being asked.

590
00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:02.875
To cool for school, huh?

591
00:31:04.208 --> 00:31:06.541
I saw the path
that they were being marched down,

592
00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.833
and I also saw a different path,
a better one for me.

593
00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:10.791
So I took it.

594
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.000
By breaking the rules?

595
00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:14.625
The rules were already broken
for someone like me.

596
00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:17.833
And if I can remember correctly,
you broke a few rules that week in Paris.

597
00:31:17.916 --> 00:31:20.166
Five days! And yes, I did.

598
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.916
I broke the rules
for the first time in my life

599
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.666
and look what good it did me.

600
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.958
- Why do you care about 'em?
- About what?

601
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:29.583
The rules. Why do you care
so much about the rules?

602
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:32.291
[sighs]

603
00:31:33.666 --> 00:31:34.666
Okay.

604
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.375
[exhales]

605
00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:41.208
Okay, when I was a kid,

606
00:31:42.083 --> 00:31:44.000
my mom was headmistress at my school.

607
00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:47.416
It was kind of a shithole,
but it had this picture,

608
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.291
a Hockney print that had been given
to the school in the '70s,

609
00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:53.750
and my mum refused to sell it.

610
00:31:53.833 --> 00:31:54.916
[Cyrus chuckles]

611
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.166
Because she wanted us to know
that we deserved beautiful things.

612
00:32:00.541 --> 00:32:04.500
That our school was just as important
as some swanky art gallery.

613
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.416
That we should all dream big.

614
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:13.041
And then someone stole it.

615
00:32:13.875 --> 00:32:15.125
Middle of the night.

616
00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:16.791
And I thought,

617
00:32:16.875 --> 00:32:18.416
"When I grow up

618
00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:21.333
I'm going to find out who did that

619
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:23.666
and bring them down."

620
00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:26.125
And did you?

621
00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:29.333
No.

622
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.291
But I did the next best thing.

623
00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:36.208
Interpol.

624
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.166
- Dream big.
- [chuckles]

625
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:41.083
[sighs]

626
00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:42.291
I admire that.

627
00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:48.750
Oh no.

628
00:32:49.708 --> 00:32:53.500
- No, no, no. I'm not doing this.
- Doing what? What are you talking about?

629
00:32:53.583 --> 00:32:56.208
Getting sucked in
to a conversation with you.

630
00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:59.017
- Conversation. Is that dangerous?
- How did you put it with your team?

631
00:32:59.041 --> 00:33:01.833
"Find the weakness,
do the job, and get out"?

632
00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:03.125
[Cyrus sighs]

633
00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:06.916
- Is that what you think I did?
- I know it is.

634
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.083
I would never lift from anyone
that doesn't deserve to lose it.

635
00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:12.958
And if I do my job well,

636
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.208
well, the thing I took,
they'll never know was missing.

637
00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:18.708
So you're saying we need to take the gold

638
00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:21.458
in a way that Jorgensen
never knows it's missing.

639
00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:23.083
We're not taking the gold.

640
00:33:23.583 --> 00:33:27.541
That's the problem on the blackboard.
We're looking at a different problem.

641
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:29.666
We are taking the plane?

642
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.625
Nice!

643
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:33.291
- The whole plane?
- It's kind of hard to take half a plane.

644
00:33:33.375 --> 00:33:35.041
With 250 people on board?

645
00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:38.083
We're not hijacking a plane, Cyrus.
It's not the '70s.

646
00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:40.166
We're not hijacking anything, Camila.

647
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.208
Don't ever use that word.

648
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:44.833
- We're borrowing it.
- Love it. Love it.

649
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:46.000
But how?

650
00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:48.208
To take a plane, you gotta fake a plane.

651
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:51.083
- All you need is a private jet.
- Oh, just like that?

652
00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:54.583
Yeah. If you can get
the planes close enough together,

653
00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:56.500
you can swap the radar signature.

654
00:33:56.583 --> 00:33:59.208
- I like it.
- Pulling up the flight logs now.

655

663
00:34:19.958 --> 00:34:21.666
You want me to give you my jet?

664
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.708
No, I want to rent it.

665
00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:25.666
But there are apps for that, man.

666
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.416
Or I can get my guy N8 to make
an NFT specifically for you.

667
00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:35.458

Hell, technically, it's not even legal
with the mods.

670
00:34:43.375 --> 00:34:44.958
Especially with the glass roof.

671
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.875
I'm not supposed to fly
in American airspace.

672
00:34:47.958 --> 00:34:48.958
[quietly] I do, though.

673

It's worth it too, to watch the stars
while, you know, you get your groove on.

674
00:34:53.916 --> 00:34:55.083
- Here's the thing...
- Yeah?

675
00:34:55.166 --> 00:34:58.333
You told an officer at Interpol you've
been illegally flying in US airspace.

676
00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:00.458
- But, he...
- [Abby] So how about this?

677
00:35:00.541 --> 00:35:03.666
We take the plane,

Leave it. No, don't sit down.

- Why not?
- Because I don't know what that stain is.

Arthur Tigue was an employee of Jorgensen.

1198
01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:32.226
- Where is the good place?
- Kind of busy, Sandra.

1199
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.291
Oh, okay.

1200
01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.291

[pilot] <i>This is Victor Sierra, 14-12.</i>

Copy that, control.
Yeah. We just felt a few bumps.

1207
01:04:02.541 --> 01:04:03.833
Which airport would that be?

1208
01:04:06.416 --> 01:04:09.208
Please proceed to Charlie Delta Foxtrot.

1209
01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:12.833
Short runway, but it shouldn't be
too challenging for a pilot of your skill.

1210
01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:19.041
<i>Copy that, control.</i>

1211

1234
01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.208
[grunts] I was wondering if you could...

1235
01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:43.000
[sniffles] Well, I'm having trouble
with the flight entertainment.

1236
01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:45.500
Of course, sir.
It's a bit tricky, isn't it?

1237
01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:47.250
I was wondering if it's this button.

1238
01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:49.958
- [attendant] Yes. This button, right here.
- [Denton] Course.

1239
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:51.750
This button here?

1240
01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:54.125
[attendant] There you go.
Then you just pick and choose...

1241

[Denton] There you go!

1242
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.166
Is that okay?

1243
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.333
This is wonderful.

1244
01:05:57.416 --> 01:05:59.416
I think I'll watch me a movie
or something.

1245
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.500

Excuse me,
there's no vaping on the flight.

1250
01:06:26.041 --> 01:06:29.208
Look at that. You caught me.
I wouldn't dream of it.

1251

They won't open the door.

Who are they?

We're flying to Tuscany.

- Shut up. You're coming with me.

- It's not a smart move.
- Interpol knows where we are.

- They'll follow us.
- Not if they can't see us.

1353
01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:39.708
We were tracking the Airbus the whole way,
and we didn't see this jet.

1354
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.791
So neither will your friends.

1355
01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.125
Get the gold on board.

1356
01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:48.291
Wait. Wait, no.
The jet can't take that much weight.

1357
01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:50.083
[Cyrus] That's why we got the trains.

1358
01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:52.583
It's at the end of the runway.
Look, if you don't believe us,

1359
01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:54.416
send one of your guys so they can see.

1360
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.458
Well, I'll take my chances with the jet,
but we'll lighten the load.

1361
01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:59.375
Dispose of him.

1371
01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:23.916
then they forced a couple passengers
onto a private jet.

1372
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.250
- Well, where's the jet now?
- We are having trouble tracking it, sir.

1373
01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:29.916

Go find it!

Yes.

- Answer him.
- It's the gold!

1383
01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:16.750
It's throwing us off balance. I told you.

- [goon] Stop talking!
- Okay.

1397
01:15:56.833 --> 01:15:59.583
- Stop talking. Just keep walking.
- Okay. That is a cool gun.

1398
01:15:59.666 --> 01:16:02.083
I'm guessing the barrel
is carbon nanofiber

1399

That's...

1413
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:33.583
Okay.

1414
01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:35.625
You should probably call a doctor!

1415
01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:38.875
We have located the jet, sir.
It's headed toward Italy.

1416
01:16:38.958 --> 01:16:40.758
[Huxley] Doesn't Jorgensen
have property here?

1417
01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:43.833
Yes, there's a villa
under a shell company in Tuscany.

1418
01:16:43.916 --> 01:16:45.625
Should we send in the Carabinieri?

1419
01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:47.708
[Huxley] We don't have
hard evidence on him yet.

1420
01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:52.041
Get me a line to NATO.
I'll tell them we have an unidentified jet

1421
01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:54.791
that's a terrorist threat,
and we need to shoot them down.

1422
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:57.708
But Agent Gladwell could be on it.

1423
01:16:57.791 --> 01:17:00.375
[Huxley] We can't risk
Jorgensen getting that gold.

1424
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:02.791
Get me NATO.

Oh, Leviathan. Welcome.
Nice to meet some of you in person.

1430

Where is the gold?

1431
01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:32.625
Ah.

1432
01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:38.500
Leviathan didn't send me here
for small talk.

1433
01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:42.208
[leader] My colleague in Zurich
says your plane did not land.

1434
01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:45.791
That was our plan
to distract the authorities.

1435
01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:47.750
The gold will arrive here.

1436
01:17:47.833 --> 01:17:51.541
Well, I hope so. We don't want
to have to empty all your bank accounts.

1437
01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.458
What do you mean?

1438
01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:58.333
The Caymans, Monaco, Panama,
Switzerland, Singapore, and the Maldives.

1439
01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:00.125
We know where your money is.

1440
01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:03.750
And we can make it
all disappear in seconds.

1441
01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.208
That's why we only deal in gold.

1442

Unhackable,

1443
01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:10.541

1444
01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.333
