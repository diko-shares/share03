1
00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:19.168
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:29.095
We're in
Moscow in the Soviet Union,

3
00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.182
and this promises to be the most
watched event in boxing history.

4
00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:44.319
I must break you.

5
00:00:49.074 --> 00:00:50.116
Throw your right!

6
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.285
He just will not
let him out of that corner.

7
00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:53.578
Rocky!

8
00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.374
Rocky Balboa is
in serious trouble.

9
00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:59.834
He's getting
killed out there.

10
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.715
Drago continuing to
punish Rocky Balboa.

11
00:01:08.677 --> 00:01:09.969
- No pain!
- No pain.

12
00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:11.304
No pain!
No pain.

13
00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.224
Rocky's been hit with bombs.

14
00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:16.851
Rocky's hurt!

15
00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:22.940
Right hand from Drago sends Rocky
Balboa 15 feet across the ring.

16
00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:24.359
And his head's down.

17
00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:26.694
Come on, get up!

18
00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:32.533
It's been
a one-sided fight so far.

19
00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.330
And Drago throws a hard right
hand that stuns Rocky Balboa.

20
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.169
They might have to stop this
one before somebody gets killed.

21
00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:51.594
Rocky taking punishment.
He is completely exhausted.

22
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.943
And Balboa goes down again
from a right hand.

23
00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.494
Taking punch after punch.

24
00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:17.912
Amazing willpower.

25
00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.212
Rocky Balboa's taking Ivan
Drago's best punches so far.

26
00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.381
He's cut
and he's bleeding.

27
00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:30.091
All right,
what's happening out there?

28
00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:31.676
I see three of him
out there.

29
00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:34.011
Hit the one in the middle.
Right!

30
00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:35.179
Hit the one in the middle.

31
00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:37.890
The Russian's cut!

32
00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:39.183
Hit him!

33
00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:46.232
Whoa! Get him! Yeah!
Go!

34
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:56.200
Hits the ground
like a wrestler.

35
00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:57.660
It's a gutter war!

36
00:02:57.745 --> 00:02:59.537
No holds barred in Moscow.

37
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:03.082
All your strength, all your
power, everything you've got!

38
00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.417
Now, this is your
whole life here.

39
00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:08.087
And a big right hand
by Rocky Balboa!

40
00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.887
Rocky Balboa has
done the impossible!

41
00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:18.306
Yeah!

42
00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:23.144
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

43
00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:25.605
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

44
00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:42.622
Man. I never saw nothing like it!

45
00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:44.707
Came through like
the champ you are.

46
00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.213
You did yourself and everybody
proud, especially Apollo.

47
00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.422
Yo, Tony.

48
00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:53.883
Yeah, what is it, baby?
What do you need?

49
00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.718
Get Adrian.

50
00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:09.398
Rocky?

51
00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:12.485
How's everybody
doing out there?

52
00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.321
Everybody...
Everything's okay.

53
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.115
What's wrong?

54
00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:21.661
What's wrong?

55
00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:27.083
Remember when Mick said
when he was fighting,

56
00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:31.587
sometimes he'd fight so hard
that he was thinking that

57
00:04:32.047 --> 00:04:37.426
he broke something inside,
and he was gonna die,

58
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.431
and that's what he said, that's
when the angels was pulling on him.

59
00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:46.102
Rocky, you're scaring me.
I don't know...

60
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:47.228
What's wrong?

61
00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:49.522
Adrian, I can't...

62
00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:50.773
Can't what?

63
00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:55.486
I can't stop my
hands from shaking.

64
00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:01.200
I never felt this thing.

65
00:05:01.285 --> 00:05:02.577
You gotta see a doctor.

66
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:04.161
No, I...
Right away. Yeah!

67
00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:06.330
No, I just wanna go home.
No.

68
00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:07.832
No.
You can see a doctor.

69
00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:09.208
I'm just tired.

70
00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:13.713
I just wanna go home, Mick.

71
00:05:13.797 --> 00:05:14.839
And I'm just tired.
I just...

72
00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:15.882
Okay.

73
00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.342
I just... I just wanna go home, okay?

74
00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:19.427
Okay.

75
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.722
Okay.

76
00:05:41.658 --> 00:05:43.242
Adrian, where's the kid?

77
00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:44.827
I don't know.

78
00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:49.624
I don't see the kid. Where's
the kid? Ain't he here?

79
00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.667
Dad! Dad!

80
00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:53.252
There he is! There he is!

81
00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:55.796
Hey, slugger, how you doing?

82
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:57.673
Say hi to your mom over there. Hi, Mom!

83
00:05:57.758 --> 00:05:58.799
Then I'm forgotten now?

84
00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:00.968
Hi, Uncle Paulie.
Dad, how you feeling?

85
00:06:01.053 --> 00:06:02.970
Well, I got a few new dents.
How you doing in school?

86
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:05.014
I made the honor roll.
You're beautiful! Home team!

87
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.682
Hi, I'm Sheila Downes, airport security. Hi.

88
00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.059
Welcome home.
If you'll follow me

89
00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:09.310
there's a press
reception inside.

90
00:06:10.812 --> 00:06:13.856
Rocky, how did you feel about
the Russian people in general?

91
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:16.025
You know, it was very
good. They was great people.

92
00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.945
I mean, I didn't understand what
they was speaking all the time,

93
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.155
but I think I understood what
they was meaning, you know?

94
00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:23.199
Mrs. Balboa, did you learn any Russian?

95
00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:24.575
Did I learn...

96
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.452
Yeah, yeah,
she got fluent in vodka.

97
00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:27.536
Hey, yo, Paulie...

98
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:28.663
Paulie.

99
00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:31.958
Rocky, there are rumors of physical
complications after the fight.

100
00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:33.125
Complications?

101
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.294
No, no,
those were rumors.

102
00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.339
He's in perfect
physical condition.

103
00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.092
Rocky. Rocky,
a question.

104
00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:43.970
Recently the American Medical
Association recommended

105
00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:45.346
that boxing be banned.

106
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.430
Yeah?

107
00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:47.640
Do you agree
with the doctors?

108
00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:49.725
Yeah, you know, absolutely.

109
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.727
I think that doctors
should never fight. No.

110
00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:54.355
That was a beautiful
answer, champ. That's right.

111
00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:56.190
Doctors should
stay out of the ring.

112
00:06:56.274 --> 00:06:57.650
Doctors should never fight.

113
00:06:57.734 --> 00:06:59.485
They should stay out
of the ring forever.

114
00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.154
Rocky Balboa,
the funniest champion ever.

115
00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:05.324
America's own Rocky Balboa.
How are ya? How are ya?

116
00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:06.951
George Washington Duke here,

117
00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:10.663
promoter extraordinaire,
welcoming back Rocky Balboa,

118
00:07:10.747 --> 00:07:13.582
champion of all the Americans
and all of the Russians.

119
00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.460
Now, I would like to digress
from the questions a bit

120
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:19.255
and pose an interesting
proposition to the media.

121
00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.174
Everyone in this city,
certainly in the world of sports,

122
00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:24.135
knows my reputation
for promoting

123
00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:25.344
some of
the finest extravaganzas...

124
00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:26.512
I... What...

125
00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:28.097
...in this country.

126
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.516
Well now,
with the press present,

127
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.476
I'd like to ask you,
Rocky Balboa...

128
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:33.561
Yeah?

129
00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:38.024
...to be the flamboyant, rambunctious
sportsman we know you can be,

130
00:07:38.108 --> 00:07:40.484
and give this man
here, Union Cane,

131
00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:44.196
a chance to challenge you for the
heavyweight championship of the world.

132
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:47.199
Balboa, I want the opportunity
to take what you got.

133
00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:50.578
Isn't this bad timing to
present a challenger, Duke?

134
00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:52.163
The man just
got off the plane.

135
00:07:52.247 --> 00:07:55.499
Timing is the essence of
life, gentlemen and ladies.

136
00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:59.086
Now, what I have on this
paper is the largest guarantee

137
00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:02.298
ever offered to
a champion on this planet!

138
00:08:02.466 --> 00:08:06.218
I'm talking about a fantastic
international extravaganza,

139
00:08:06.303 --> 00:08:10.139
to be held in Japan, called
"Letting It Go in Tokyo."

140
00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:13.350
People, ain't it incredible
that only in America

141
00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:15.269
could people like us
rise from oppression,

142
00:08:15.353 --> 00:08:19.607
rise from poverty, to join hands
in this international event?

143
00:08:19.691 --> 00:08:20.775
Only in America!

144
00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:21.942
Excuse me!

145
00:08:23.153 --> 00:08:26.238
Excuse me.
My husband is retired.

146
00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:28.908
He has nothing... He has
nothing more to prove.

147
00:08:28.992 --> 00:08:30.284
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

148
00:08:30.368 --> 00:08:33.412
Hey, Rocky, don't you consider
this a public responsibility

149
00:08:33.497 --> 00:08:35.790
to respond now
rather than later?

150
00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:37.291
Respond to the people.

151
00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:39.502
I mean, isn't this a
question of professionalism?

152
00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:41.545
To talk about it now,
not later.

153
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.089
Mind if I heal first?

154
00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:45.508
The whipping you got ain't nothing
like what I got here for you.

155
00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:46.967
So, what in the hell
does this all mean?

156
00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:50.054
No, that isn't enough.
We gotta hear about this now.

157
00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:52.014
Gotta think about that.
So, anyway,

158
00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:56.644
I wanna tell everybody that
the flight over was really nice.

159
00:08:57.479 --> 00:08:58.771
Come on, guys.
We need more!

160
00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:00.815
Adrian, you know,
if you weren't with me,

161
00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:02.483
I never would
have done as good.

162
00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:04.610
You're my Adrian... You're
always there, you know?

163
00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:09.156
And my kid, having you is
like being born all over again.

164
00:09:09.324 --> 00:09:12.159
Come on, what do you say?
Are you gonna retire or not?

165
00:09:12.244 --> 00:09:15.454
Anyway, I'd like... Excuse
me. I'd like to go home now.

166
00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:16.914
Are you gonna give us
something to write?

167
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.958
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- What do you say?

168
00:09:19.376 --> 00:09:20.459
No.

169
00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:27.967
Don't worry. You'll get him. You'll get him.

170
00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.573
I know.
Really, it's great.

171
00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:55.035
Yo, look at this place.

172
00:09:55.954 --> 00:09:57.997
I swear, I ain't never
leaving this place again,

173
00:09:58.081 --> 00:09:59.081
you know that?

174
00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:02.501
I swear... Hey, would you like to dance?

175
00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:04.503
How about a homecoming
dance with your old man?

176
00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:06.005
No, don't be silly.
It's cold.

177
00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:08.007
Come on. I'll warm you up, young lady.

178
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:10.676
Come on, have a dance. Hurry
up, the music's almost over.

179
00:10:12.888 --> 00:10:13.971
Do you like the song?

180
00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:15.431
You should rest.

181
00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:17.057
Yeah, I know.
I'm tired. Come on.

182
00:10:17.142 --> 00:10:18.684
Yeah? Well, maybe I'll take you upstairs

183
00:10:18.768 --> 00:10:20.853
and violate you
like a parking meter.

184
00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:22.688
It'll cost you
a quarter.

185
00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:24.231
Yo, Adrian!

186
00:10:24.316 --> 00:10:26.442
Where'd you learn to
talk dirty like that?

187
00:10:29.404 --> 00:10:33.073
Hey, Uncle Paulie, you notice
something strange about Dad?

188
00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:36.160
He just took
a few hard shots.

189
00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:39.496
I think you tell better jokes than me,
Adrian.

190
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:45.794
Yo, did I hear somebody
call for their old man?

191
00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.213
Did you do this?

192
00:10:47.297 --> 00:10:49.465
Hey, it's sleep time,
kid, okay?

193
00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:51.967
Dad, did you know that your
bones grow three times as fast

194
00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:53.177
during the night?

195
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:55.930
No, I didn't know that, but I
heard something like that once.

196
00:10:56.014 --> 00:10:57.097
Is that me?
Excellent!

197
00:10:57.182 --> 00:10:59.016
Yeah,
that's you.

198
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.351
Now, is that me?
Yeah.

199
00:11:00.435 --> 00:11:02.228
When we was fishing, right?
Yeah, that's when...

200
00:11:02.312 --> 00:11:04.730
That's beautiful.
Look at the tent.

201
00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:08.400
You know, the fish was a
lot bigger, if I recall.

202
00:11:08.485 --> 00:11:11.779
Well, actually, that was a lot smaller.

203
00:11:11.863 --> 00:11:14.073
Now, anyway, come on.
Hit the bed.

204
00:11:14.157 --> 00:11:16.200
It's time for you to get
healthy and everything.

205
00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:17.451
This is great,
how you do this.

206
00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:19.370
I don't know where
you learned this.

207
00:11:19.454 --> 00:11:22.498
It is something, how this
thing comes out of your fingers.

208
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:24.708
Oh, my God.

209
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.461
Oh, my God.

210
00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:31.465
Who's this?

211
00:11:33.176 --> 00:11:36.512
That's Madame Dupont,
my French teacher.

212
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.180
Really?

213
00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:43.435
Yeah, she looks French, sure.

214
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.854
I wouldn't show this
to your mother,

215
00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:48.440
'cause she don't understand French too good.

216
00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:51.610
God. Better cover
that one up.

217
00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:53.529
Well, champ,
it's bedtime.

218
00:11:54.364 --> 00:11:56.865
Hey, you know what?
I know some French talk.

219
00:11:57.325 --> 00:11:58.450
Knock, knock.

220
00:11:58.535 --> 00:11:59.535
Who's there?

221
00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:00.786
Madame.

222
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.954
Madame who?

223
00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:03.789
My damn foot's
caught in the door.

224
00:12:03.873 --> 00:12:05.124
That's an old joke.

225
00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:07.835
What do you want from me?
I'm trying. You know?

226
00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:09.878
I don't know all the good things, you know?

227
00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:12.423
Hey, what's this?

228
00:12:12.507 --> 00:12:13.590
What?

229
00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.218
Look what I
found in your ear.

230
00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:18.679
Russian money.
Money ears!

231
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:22.558
All right. Anyway, listen,
kid, you gotta get some sleep.

232
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:24.018
Dad?
Yeah?

233
00:12:24.394 --> 00:12:27.271
Today when you said having me
was like being born again...

234
00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:29.273
Yeah?
What did you mean?

235
00:12:30.025 --> 00:12:34.403
Well, you know, when you come
up like I did, and you got like

236
00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:39.533
three square meals of zero
a day, you know what I mean?

237
00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:41.827
You got the A side of life
and the B side of life.

238
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:45.664
I'm, like, on the B side, but
you, you got all the breaks.

239
00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:50.002
So, when I see you having all
these things that I didn't have,

240
00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:53.255
I, like,
live through your eyes.

241
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.423
I enjoy it a little bit.

242
00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:57.885
It's like having
it all over again.

243
00:12:57.969 --> 00:12:59.261
That's nice.

244
00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.639
Hey, look at my face.

245
00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:04.141
Do I look like a raccoon?

246
00:13:05.143 --> 00:13:06.143
A little bit.

247
00:13:06.227 --> 00:13:08.228
Yeah, like Rocky Raccoon?
Yeah, a little bit.

248
00:13:08.313 --> 00:13:10.272
No!
Yeah, you do a little.

249
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.398
Really?

250
00:13:11.483 --> 00:13:15.402
Hey, if you think I look bad, you
ought to see the other guy's knuckles.

251
00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:19.990
Anyway, yo, good night.

252
00:13:20.075 --> 00:13:21.283
Okay, kid?
Night.

253
00:13:23.578 --> 00:13:24.953
Dad?
Yo.

254
00:13:26.498 --> 00:13:27.790
Glad you're home.

255
00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.084
Thanks. I appreciate it.

256
00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:32.419
And we'll play tomorrow,
okay?

257
00:13:33.171 --> 00:13:34.838
Maybe you can show me
your English teacher.

258
00:13:34.923 --> 00:13:36.215
She's pretty hot, too.

259
00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:37.883
Nah!
Yeah.

260
00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:39.385
Good night, kid.

261
00:13:39.469 --> 00:13:41.303
You deserve the
worst for what you did.

262
00:13:42.472 --> 00:13:44.556
Paulie, it wasn't your
money. It was Rocky's money.

263
00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:46.392
You gonna be hysterical?
You cost us everything.

264
00:13:46.476 --> 00:13:48.394
That's what I need.
It was a mistake.

265
00:13:48.478 --> 00:13:51.230
You think I thought this
all was gonna happen?

266
00:13:51.314 --> 00:13:52.981
Don't you walk
away from me.

267
00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:55.692
You just gave up
our life!

268
00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:58.487
And you think it's
like some stupid thing?

269
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.240
Paulie! Paulie, do you know what you did?

270
00:14:01.324 --> 00:14:02.783
Do you know the seriousness of what you did?

271
00:14:02.867 --> 00:14:03.909
I understand it!

272
00:14:03.993 --> 00:14:05.327
Do you?
Then answer me!

273
00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:07.287
I understand
the whole freaking thing!

274
00:14:07.372 --> 00:14:10.749
I understand it! Your
accountant's the crook, not me!

275
00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:12.543
I did what I
thought was right.

276
00:14:12.627 --> 00:14:14.044
So, now, don't blame me for nothing.

277
00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:16.505
I want to murder the bum
worse than anybody.

278
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.590
Hey, Adrian,
what's wrong?

279
00:14:18.675 --> 00:14:20.259
Look what you done now.

280
00:14:20.343 --> 00:14:21.427
She's dumping
everything on me.

281
00:14:21.511 --> 00:14:23.262
Come on, Paulie.
Don't turn this around on me.

282
00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:24.555
Come on, what'd you do, Paulie?

283
00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:26.098
He gave power...

284
00:14:26.182 --> 00:14:28.142
Power of attorney to our accountant. What?

285
00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:32.062
Gave... I just didn't gave
anything to nobody, huh?

286
00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:33.230
He sent a letter!

287
00:14:33.314 --> 00:14:35.732
He says we're gonna be in Russia
a couple of months. He says,

288
00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:38.277
"And I need Rocky
to sign a tax extension!"

289
00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:42.114
Not an extension! That was
a power of attorney, Paulie!

290
00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:44.700
He's the thief!
I need alcohol.

291
00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:48.203
Rocky, on my eyes, I never
stole a freaking dime.

292
00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:51.373
Adrian,
what's happening here?

293
00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:52.958
It's gone.

294
00:14:53.042 --> 00:14:54.168
What's gone?

295
00:14:54.252 --> 00:14:55.878
The money.
The money.

296
00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:57.838
Everything.
It's all gone.

297
00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:00.132
The piece of paper
Paulie had you sign

298
00:15:00.216 --> 00:15:02.968
wasn't a request for an
extension on your tax returns.

299
00:15:03.052 --> 00:15:07.055
It was a blanket power of attorney
in favor of the accountant,

300
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.142
who was involved in some very
high-priced commercial real estate.

301
00:15:10.226 --> 00:15:12.311
He thought he could flip
it quick, take his profit,

302
00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:14.438
have your money back
before you knew it was gone.

303
00:15:14.522 --> 00:15:17.316
And unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room,

304
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.152
his deals fell through
because the market dried up.

305
00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:21.778
And you lost millions.

306
00:15:21.863 --> 00:15:23.655
So, what are you saying? There
ain't nothing I can do about it?

307
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.241
I'm doing plenty. I've filed
eight criminal acts against him,

308
00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:29.077
but you've got tremendous debt
payment on this property, Rocky.

309
00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:31.330
You didn't pay your tax returns in six years,

310
00:15:31.414 --> 00:15:33.624
and the mortgage on your house
hasn't been paid in months.

311
00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:37.169
Wait, we didn't have a mortgage.
Our house was fully paid for.

312
00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:38.712
Don't take it from me.
Ask him.

313
00:15:38.796 --> 00:15:42.508
Apparently not. There's nearly
$400,000 still outstanding.

314
00:15:42.592 --> 00:15:44.384
The only thing you have
that's not encumbered

315
00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:46.428
is a gymnasium that was
willed to your son

316
00:15:46.513 --> 00:15:49.515
by a Mickey Goldmill
in 1982.

317
00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:52.184
You can sell some things.
Remember those commercials you did?

318
00:15:52.268 --> 00:15:54.645
You know, Paulie, I ain't
no commercial kind of guy.

319
00:15:54.729 --> 00:15:56.563
I'm a fighter.
It's what I do for a living.

320
00:15:56.648 --> 00:15:59.149
Nah, it's just as well.
We couldn't get any sponsors.

321
00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:01.193
With the investigation
of the accountant,

322
00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:03.487
out pops a criminal record
of Rocky's for assault

323
00:16:03.571 --> 00:16:05.113
in connection
with loan sharking.

324
00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:07.491
But that was a long time
ago. He didn't know what...

325
00:16:07.575 --> 00:16:09.076
Why not a couple more fights?

326
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.369
With your
popularity right now,

327
00:16:10.453 --> 00:16:11.912
you could be out of
this thing in no time.

328
00:16:11.996 --> 00:16:13.038
No, he's retiring.

329
00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:14.540
Rocko, fighting's the ticket.

330
00:16:14.624 --> 00:16:16.542
I said he's retired!

331
00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:18.460
Paulie, we're here
because of you!

332
00:16:19.087 --> 00:16:21.338
I'm not taking
the heat for all this.

333
00:16:21.422 --> 00:16:23.048
I thought I was
doing smart business.

334
00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:25.133
You thought you
did smart business?

335
00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:26.176
Hey, you...
Me?

336
00:16:26.302 --> 00:16:28.178
What are you talking about me?
The accountant was your choice!

337
00:16:28.304 --> 00:16:29.596
My choice? You should
have known he was a thief,

338
00:16:29.681 --> 00:16:30.681
but you're never awake

339
00:16:30.765 --> 00:16:33.350
because you live in this fairy-tale
world where the air don't move.

340
00:16:33.476 --> 00:16:35.310
Paulie... You're like a
season that don't change!

341
00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:36.728
Hey, you don't
talk to her like this.

342
00:16:36.813 --> 00:16:38.438
I'm not no tomato
can you kick around!

343
00:16:38.523 --> 00:16:39.856
Paulie, no!
Yeah!

344
00:16:39.983 --> 00:16:42.317
You call Duke. You tell him I'll fight Cane.

345
00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:44.069
I don't care,
anywhere, anytime.

346
00:16:44.195 --> 00:16:45.362
- No, Rocky.
- If that's what you want,

347
00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:46.572
I'll get on it right away.

348
00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:47.739
No. No.

349
00:16:47.824 --> 00:16:48.824
Rocky, Rocky, please.

350
00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:51.702
We can't go down like this. A couple
of fights, we're out of trouble, Adrian.

351
00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:52.911
Yeah, but you said you wouldn't.

352
00:16:52.996 --> 00:16:54.121
No, I didn't say anything.

353
00:16:54.205 --> 00:16:55.455
Look, did we come
this far to lose it?

354
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.124
Well, you know, you have to see a doctor.

355
00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:58.584
Adrian, I don't need to see no doctor.

356
00:16:58.668 --> 00:16:59.710
I need to get
a promoter.

357
00:16:59.794 --> 00:17:00.877
Hey, you know, you gotta see a doctor.

358
00:17:01.004 --> 00:17:02.796
If he says it's all right, I'll
support anything you wanna do.

359
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.047
I gotta fight, okay?

360
00:17:04.132 --> 00:17:05.591
I got problems.
I gotta fight.

361
00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:08.218
Will you do it for me?

362
00:17:10.513 --> 00:17:12.139
All right, for you.

363
00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.101
Because of the continuous
violent blows to the head,

364
00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:18.353
you've developed a condition
particular to boxers

365
00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:20.772
called cavum
septum pellucidum,

366
00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:24.276
which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles.

367
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.155
The brain's surface neurons in this
area have also been traumatized.

368
00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:30.741
Excuse me, Doctor.
Simply stated, Mr. Balboa,

369
00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:33.952
it means that you've suffered
some damage to the brain.

370
00:17:34.037 --> 00:17:35.954
How long until he recovers?

371
00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:37.664
The effects
are irreversible.

372
00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:42.628
I... Rocky,
you have to retire.

373
00:17:42.712 --> 00:17:44.046
Adrian,
I don't want to retire.

374
00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.756
You know, this ain't
the time to retire.

375
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.425
No, not in here,
not in no office.

376
00:17:49.052 --> 00:17:52.804
I just fought the best fight of
my life. I just did that, you know,

377
00:17:54.265 --> 00:17:56.808
and all I need
is a couple more.

378
00:17:56.893 --> 00:17:59.353
No, Rocky, you suffered severe brain trauma.

379
00:17:59.437 --> 00:18:01.146
Well, he could be wrong.
Anybody could be wrong.

380
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.230
I don't think he is.

381
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:04.483
He ain't God. Look, Adrian,
only God ain't wrong.

382
00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:06.860
Hey, Rocky,
this is what's good for you.

383
00:18:06.944 --> 00:18:08.654
All I need is
a couple easy ones, right?

384
00:18:08.738 --> 00:18:11.114
Not with the way it is. You
can't get licensed in any state.

385
00:18:11.199 --> 00:18:13.575
He can't get
licensed anyway, Doctor?

386
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.785
That is correct.

387
00:18:15.411 --> 00:18:17.871
Rocky,
do you love me?

388
00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:22.000
Yeah, I love you.
Why you ask that?

389
00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:24.670
Because if you
love somebody,

390
00:18:24.754 --> 00:18:26.838
you live with them,
you live for them.

391
00:18:26.923 --> 00:18:28.965
You don't gamble
with a life.

392
00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.010
Rocky, I don't care about the money.
It's you.

393
00:18:33.137 --> 00:18:34.930
That's all that matters.

394
00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:40.602
Please. We'll be okay. We'll be fine.

395
00:18:44.524 --> 00:18:45.774
No one's gotta know...

396
00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:48.944
Uh...

397
00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:53.156
No one has to know,
doctor, right?

398
00:18:53.241 --> 00:18:55.117
It'll be
strictly confidential.

399
00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:01.206
Thank you.

400
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.729
May we hear
our next bid, please?

401
00:19:23.813 --> 00:19:25.063
Are you done?

402
00:19:26.274 --> 00:19:27.399
Sold.

403
00:19:30.653 --> 00:19:33.780
Moving along, ladies and
gentlemen, item number 46.

404
00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:36.158
Hey, kid.
Bike's been sold.

405
00:19:36.993 --> 00:19:39.578
Hey, bike's been sold.
Get off the bike. Come on.

406
00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:47.669
We have an opening bid.
$25,000 is the bid.

407
00:19:49.213 --> 00:19:51.465
Don't worry about it.
We've been down before.

408
00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:53.133
I'll get it all back.

409
00:19:53.217 --> 00:19:55.343
We just gotta stick together,
all right?

410
00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:56.762
Home team.

411
00:19:56.846 --> 00:19:57.846
Yeah, right.

412
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.055
Sold.

413
00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:01.683
Come on, you know,
Mickey used to say

414
00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:04.144
a fight ain't over
till you heard the bell.

415
00:20:04.228 --> 00:20:05.937
We ain't heard
a bell yet, have we?

416
00:20:06.022 --> 00:20:09.983
Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves
from his first heavyweight fight.

417
00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:28.960
Rocky?

418
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.005
Hey, it still fits.

419
00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:37.552
Why you wearing
those clothes?

420
00:20:37.637 --> 00:20:40.639
I was just going through some of
the stuff up there, and I found 'em,

421
00:20:40.723 --> 00:20:43.016
and they feel kind of
comfortable, you know?

422
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.269
Well, I was looking all
over for you downstairs.

423
00:20:46.354 --> 00:20:47.312
It's kind of
depressing.

424
00:20:47.396 --> 00:20:50.106
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

425
00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:53.318
What's this
doing in your ear?

426
00:20:53.402 --> 00:20:54.528
What? Oh, God.

427
00:20:54.612 --> 00:20:56.112
Remember these?

428
00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.657
I... Yeah.

429
00:20:58.741 --> 00:21:00.492
Go ahead.
You...

430
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:01.701
I remember when
you took them off.

431
00:21:01.786 --> 00:21:02.828
That's right.

432
00:21:02.912 --> 00:21:05.747
First time I ever
kissed you, remember?

433
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.249
Kiss me.

434
00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:12.838
Adrian, I want to go out
for a little bit, you know?

435
00:21:12.922 --> 00:21:14.673
Just take a little walk.

436
00:21:14.757 --> 00:21:16.341
I just wanna
feel better, but...

437
00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:19.302
Hey, could you talk to the kid?
'Cause he's...

438
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720
He's really taking
this hard, you know?

439
00:21:20.805 --> 00:21:21.888
Sure.

440
00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.014
Okay?

441
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:24.933
Where you going?

442
00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:26.810
I thought I'd go to Andy's.

443
00:22:11.772 --> 00:22:13.690
How you doing, Mick?

444
00:23:24.428 --> 00:23:25.804
Slip the jab.

445
00:23:27.765 --> 00:23:29.224
Slip the jab.
Slip the jab.

446
00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:30.725
Slip the jab,
will ya?

447
00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:33.395
Slip the jab!

448
00:23:36.315 --> 00:23:38.441
That's right.
That's it.

449
00:23:38.526 --> 00:23:40.276
Hey, I didn't
hear no bell!

450
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:41.569
Okay.

451
00:23:42.405 --> 00:23:43.822
All right. That's right.

452
00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:47.492
Slip the jab.
That's it. Mentalize.

453
00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:49.703
See that bum
in front of you.

454
00:23:49.787 --> 00:23:52.914
You see yourself doing right,
and you do right.

455
00:23:54.041 --> 00:23:56.001
That's pretty.
That's very pretty.

456
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.336
Time!

457
00:23:58.421 --> 00:24:01.840
Come here, Rock. My God,
you're ready, ain't you?

458
00:24:01.924 --> 00:24:03.466
And Apollo won't
know what hit him.

459
00:24:03.551 --> 00:24:07.721
You're gonna roll over him like
a bulldozer, an Italian bulldozer.

460
00:24:08.389 --> 00:24:10.181
You know, kid,
I know how you feel

461
00:24:10.266 --> 00:24:12.267
about this fight
that's coming up.

462
00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:15.020
Because
I was young once, too.

463
00:24:16.063 --> 00:24:17.522
And I tell you something.

464
00:24:18.816 --> 00:24:24.320
Well, if you wasn't here, I
probably wouldn't be alive today.

465
00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:26.948
The fact that you're here

466
00:24:27.033 --> 00:24:29.868
and doing as well
as you're doing gives me,

467
00:24:29.952 --> 00:24:33.621
what do you call it, a
motivization to stay alive?

468
00:24:34.248 --> 00:24:36.833
'Cause I think that
people die sometimes

469
00:24:36.917 --> 00:24:38.460
when they don't
wanna live no more.

470
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:41.129
"Nature's smarter
than people think."

471
00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:43.548
And nature is smarter
than people think.

472
00:24:43.632 --> 00:24:46.801
Little by little, we lose our
friends, we lose everything.

473
00:24:46.886 --> 00:24:49.971
We keep losing and
losing till we say,

474
00:24:50.973 --> 00:24:53.058
you know, "What the hell
am I living around here for?

475
00:24:53.142 --> 00:24:55.226
"I got no reason to go on."

476
00:24:56.645 --> 00:25:01.107
But with you, kid, boy,
I got a reason to go on,

477
00:25:01.901 --> 00:25:05.904
and I'm gonna stay alive, and
I will watch you make good.

478
00:25:06.322 --> 00:25:07.405
"And I'll never leave you."

479
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:08.782
And I'll never leave you

480
00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:10.325
until that happens.

481
00:25:10.826 --> 00:25:14.996
'Cause when I leave you, you'll
not only know how to fight,

482
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:19.084
you'll be able to take care of
yourself outside the ring, too.

483
00:25:19.168 --> 00:25:20.251
Is that okay?

484
00:25:20.336 --> 00:25:21.336
It's okay.

485
00:25:22.171 --> 00:25:23.880
Okay.

486
00:25:23.964 --> 00:25:25.465
Now, I got
a little gift for you.

487
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:27.425
Mick, you... Now, wait a
minute. Wait a minute now.

488
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.468
Wait a minute.

489
00:25:28.552 --> 00:25:29.719
Really, I don't
need nothing.

490
00:25:29.804 --> 00:25:32.347
Look at this. See that?

491
00:25:32.515 --> 00:25:35.141
This is the favorite thing
that I have on this Earth,

492
00:25:36.435 --> 00:25:38.937
and Rocky Marciano
give me that.

493
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.815
You know what it was?
His cufflink.

494
00:25:43.526 --> 00:25:45.652
And now I'm
giving it to you.

495
00:25:46.904 --> 00:25:49.405
And it is gonna be
like a...

496
00:25:50.366 --> 00:25:53.034
Like an angel on
your shoulder, see?

497
00:25:53.828 --> 00:25:58.540
If you ever get hurt, and you
feel that you're going down,

498
00:25:59.458 --> 00:26:02.585
this little angel is
gonna whisper in your ear.

499
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.506
He's gonna say, "Get up, you son of a bitch,

500
00:26:07.925 --> 00:26:09.509
"'cause Mickey loves you."

501
00:26:10.219 --> 00:26:11.302
Okay?

502
00:26:12.972 --> 00:26:14.264
Thanks, Mick.
All right.

503
00:26:14.348 --> 00:26:16.432
I love you, too.

504
00:26:17.351 --> 00:26:18.726
Go after 'em, kid.

505
00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:21.521
Go after 'em.
Thanks.

506
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.902
You was the angel.

507
00:26:28.988 --> 00:26:30.238
There it is.

508
00:26:30.698 --> 00:26:32.157
What happened to
his other cufflink?

509
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:34.325
I don't know.
He only give me one.

510
00:26:35.244 --> 00:26:37.078
He gave it to some bum.

511
00:27:27.755 --> 00:27:29.214
Don't worry about these.

512
00:27:29.298 --> 00:27:30.965
All right.
Let's go, Paulie.

513
00:27:31.926 --> 00:27:33.801
I really can't believe it.
This kid's taking this too good.

514
00:27:33.928 --> 00:27:35.553
Need a hand, champ?
No, I got it.

515
00:27:35.638 --> 00:27:38.181
Hey, Rock. It's good I
kept the place, right?

516
00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:39.724
How you doing?
It saves money.

517
00:27:39.808 --> 00:27:41.559
Yeah.
Hey, get back.

518
00:27:41.644 --> 00:27:42.644
Right?

519
00:27:43.145 --> 00:27:46.731
A little aluminum on the
front, hey, it's a winner.

520
00:27:50.277 --> 00:27:51.361
Thank you.

521
00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:55.823
Welcome back, Rocky!
We missed ya!

522
00:27:57.368 --> 00:27:59.661
It's only... It's only temporary, you know?

523
00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:01.955
Come on inside.

524
00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:05.333
Thanks.

525
00:28:13.008 --> 00:28:14.801
- Hello?
- Mrs. Balboa?

526
00:28:14.885 --> 00:28:16.594
George Washington Duke here.

527
00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:17.762
Yes?

528
00:28:17.846 --> 00:28:19.639
Mrs. Balboa, can you hear it?

529
00:28:19.723 --> 00:28:21.933
Listen close,
you must be able to hear it.

530
00:28:23.143 --> 00:28:24.143
Hear what?

531
00:28:24.228 --> 00:28:25.770
The sound of
the parade going by,

532
00:28:25.854 --> 00:28:27.981
of opportunity knocking.

533
00:28:28.065 --> 00:28:30.149
I mean, what's it gonna take
to get you people to realize

534
00:28:30.234 --> 00:28:33.611
I'm giving you a chance to
pull yourselves together again?

535
00:28:33.696 --> 00:28:36.030
Let me handle your husband's
career and the money will pour in.

536
00:28:36.115 --> 00:28:38.574
You can start living
like human beings again.

537
00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:41.577
Listen, Mr. Duke, we're
living like human beings.

538
00:28:41.662 --> 00:28:43.288
You ought to
try it sometime.

539
00:28:44.832 --> 00:28:46.624
You leave my husband alone.

540
00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:51.504
Women.

541
00:28:58.721 --> 00:29:00.430
When'd you
start that?

542
00:29:01.056 --> 00:29:03.433
I don't know. It's like a
bad habit that comes back.

543
00:29:03.517 --> 00:29:04.934
But, hey, listen.

544
00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:08.146
We ain't talking about me,
we're talking about you, right?

545
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.272
Hey, Rocky,
how you doing, man?

546
00:29:09.356 --> 00:29:10.315
Yo. How you doing?

547
00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:11.733
Good to see you back
in the neighborhood.

548
00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:13.109
Yeah. Thank you.
It's great to be back.

549
00:29:13.193 --> 00:29:14.777
You know, you're
real smart in school,

550
00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:17.030
but you gotta be smart
on the street, too, see?

551
00:29:17.114 --> 00:29:18.323
How do you mean?

552
00:29:18.407 --> 00:29:20.116
Well, you gotta know
who the players are

553
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.035
and, like, who you're talking to around here.

554
00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:24.495
Watch out for the scammers.
Everybody's gonna try to scam.

555
00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.497
What's a scam?
Ask your father.

556
00:29:26.582 --> 00:29:29.042
Well, a scam is
like a hustle.

557
00:29:29.543 --> 00:29:30.501
He don't get it.

558
00:29:30.586 --> 00:29:32.003
Well, you know, like
a hustle's related to...

559
00:29:32.087 --> 00:29:33.212
Rocky?
Yeah?

560
00:29:33.297 --> 00:29:35.006
Rocky, remember me?
I'm Bubba's mother.

561
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.090
Yeah.

562
00:29:36.175 --> 00:29:37.842
You used to use his head for a punching bag.

563
00:29:37.926 --> 00:29:38.926
Yeah, he had
a nice head.

564
00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:40.178
Welcome back.

565
00:29:41.096 --> 00:29:43.723
So, anyway, like a hustle's
related to a con, you know?

566
00:29:43.807 --> 00:29:45.808
- He don't get it.
- A deception.

567
00:29:45.934 --> 00:29:46.934
Excuse me?

568
00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:48.102
You're saying
beware of deceptions.

569
00:29:48.187 --> 00:29:50.229
Yeah, that's good.
Absolutely.

570
00:29:50.314 --> 00:29:51.647
You're very smart,
you know?

571
00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:56.402
Hey, ain't this where the
Atomic Hoagie shop used to be?

572
00:29:56.487 --> 00:29:58.321
I'm new here,
Dad.

573
00:29:58.614 --> 00:30:00.907
This neighborhood's coming
down with tooth decay.

574
00:30:00.991 --> 00:30:02.408
It's called
urban blight.

575
00:30:02.493 --> 00:30:03.534
Yeah?

576
00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:07.288
I'll tell you something, this
place is blight new, you know?

577
00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:09.665
I think a little aluminum
siding and some paint,

578
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.918
this place could be okay
again. What do you think?

579
00:30:12.002 --> 00:30:13.878
I don't know. Anyway, we're
gonna be late for school. Come on.

580
00:30:13.962 --> 00:30:16.881
Hey, Paulie, I wanna talk to
the kid private, like, you know,

581
00:30:16.965 --> 00:30:18.007
man to smaller man,
all right?

582
00:30:18.092 --> 00:30:19.300
Right.
Like I got no feelings.

583
00:30:19.385 --> 00:30:20.385
Come on, Paulie.

584
00:30:20.469 --> 00:30:21.594
That's how wars start.

585
00:30:21.678 --> 00:30:23.179
Relax, would you?

586
00:30:23.263 --> 00:30:25.181
So, anyway, you know, everybody's
got an angle, you know?

587
00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:27.225
Yo, tough break, Rock.
Yeah.

588
00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:29.060
Everybody's got
a hustle, you know?

589
00:30:29.144 --> 00:30:30.269
See, like these kids around here,

590
00:30:30.354 --> 00:30:31.938
they got street brains,
you see?

591
00:30:32.022 --> 00:30:33.064
That's how they live.

592
00:30:33.148 --> 00:30:34.607
These kids ain't like...
Listen to me.

593
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:37.652
They ain't like no personalities
that you growed up with.

594
00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:40.363
So you gotta stay very,
very sharp around here.

595
00:30:40.447 --> 00:30:42.031
I intend to.

596
00:30:42.116 --> 00:30:45.660
"Intend." You know, sometimes
you make me feel very stupid.

597
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:47.912
Why?
Why?

598
00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:49.914
'Cause you're smarter
than me, and that's a fact.

599
00:30:49.998 --> 00:30:51.582
No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

600
00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:53.751
It's like every day
you learn something new,

601
00:30:53.836 --> 00:30:55.753
and every day I
forget something new,

602
00:30:55.838 --> 00:30:57.588
but listen.
Listen to me.

603
00:30:57.673 --> 00:31:00.299
We're in this thing together,
so if you can figure out any way

604
00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:02.760
on how to fix things up,
don't be afraid to tell me,

605
00:31:02.845 --> 00:31:05.805
'cause we gotta stick
together, 'cause what are we?

606
00:31:05.889 --> 00:31:07.598
What?

607
00:31:07.683 --> 00:31:08.850
What are we?

608
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:10.852
Oh, oh...
Home team.

609
00:31:10.936 --> 00:31:12.687
Home team! You know, you got that right.

610
00:31:12.771 --> 00:31:14.439
You know, I used to go to
this school when I was a kid.

611
00:31:14.523 --> 00:31:15.523
You know. Nice bricks.

612
00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:17.608
Used to have good milk
at lunch and everything.

613
00:31:17.693 --> 00:31:18.776
It was real tough then,

614
00:31:18.861 --> 00:31:21.487
but I think you can
handle it, don't you think?

615
00:31:21.572 --> 00:31:24.657
No way, you don't even
know what you're talking about.

616
00:31:24.741 --> 00:31:26.659
If you went here,
I can go here.

617
00:31:27.744 --> 00:31:30.079
I'm not scared, really.

618
00:31:30.164 --> 00:31:31.289
Really?

619
00:31:32.374 --> 00:31:34.792
Well, I guess
I'm a little scared.

620
00:31:34.877 --> 00:31:36.252
But that's normal,
don't you think?

621
00:31:36.336 --> 00:31:38.463
Yeah. You know,
I had 72 fights coming up,

622
00:31:38.547 --> 00:31:40.131
and every one of 'em
I was scared.

623
00:31:40.215 --> 00:31:43.634
So, yeah, you know,
that's real, real normal.

624
00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:47.638
I'll see ya later.

625
00:31:47.723 --> 00:31:48.806
Okay, kid.

626
00:31:48.891 --> 00:31:50.308
Here's the front door.

627
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.728
Okay. Hey, wait!
What's this?

628
00:31:53.812 --> 00:31:54.812
What's...

629
00:31:56.064 --> 00:31:57.106
Goodness gracious.

630
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:58.649
Where'd this come from?

631
00:31:58.734 --> 00:32:01.861
It's a strange place to stash
your lunch money, don't you think?

632
00:32:01.945 --> 00:32:04.155
It's just a lunch joke, you know?

633
00:32:04.239 --> 00:32:05.281
Thanks, Dad.

634
00:32:05.365 --> 00:32:07.283
Okay, listen.
I'll see you later.

635
00:32:08.076 --> 00:32:10.453
Remember, Daddy loves you.
You're number one.

636
00:32:10.537 --> 00:32:11.662
Home team!

637
00:32:11.747 --> 00:32:14.165
Just be nice, right?
You'll be okay.

638
00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:17.835
And don't mess with
nobody's girlfriend.

639
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.462
They don't like
that around here.

640
00:32:26.386 --> 00:32:28.513
You know, Paulie, I'm
really worried about the kid.

641
00:32:28.597 --> 00:32:30.348
You know, he ain't
used to living like this.

642
00:32:30.432 --> 00:32:32.183
He don't know
the streets or nothing.

643
00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:34.852
And that school, I know
exactly what's gonna happen.

644
00:32:34.937 --> 00:32:37.897
Some wise guy's gonna come
up to him 'cause he's my kid.

645
00:32:37.981 --> 00:32:40.024
He's just gonna come out
and try to bang him out,

646
00:32:40.108 --> 00:32:43.027
give him a cheap shot,
you know? I mean... Jeez.

647
00:32:43.111 --> 00:32:44.195
Mr. Balboa?
Yeah?

648
00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:45.404
How you doing?
My name's Tommy Gunn.

649
00:32:45.489 --> 00:32:46.572
Yeah, how
you doing?

650
00:32:46.657 --> 00:32:48.491
Well, with a name like that,
you better be tough.

651
00:32:48.575 --> 00:32:50.201
Yeah, very true.
It ain't easy.

652
00:32:50.285 --> 00:32:51.661
Anyway, I come
from Oklahoma.

653
00:32:51.745 --> 00:32:52.745
Welcome.

654
00:32:52.829 --> 00:32:54.038
I have an amateur's
record of 45-to-one.

655
00:32:54.122 --> 00:32:56.123
And I turned pro at 18,
and I had eight fights.

656
00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:58.000
You're a fighter?
Yeah, I'm a fighter.

657
00:32:58.085 --> 00:33:00.962
And now that I'm 20, I'd just
like to show you what I got.

658
00:33:01.088 --> 00:33:02.880
Well, I... I mean, I've
saved up about 400 bucks.

659
00:33:02.965 --> 00:33:04.382
Mr. Rocky Balboa. I could
pay you for training.

660
00:33:04.466 --> 00:33:05.508
Yeah... What?

661
00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:07.301
Excuse me, young man,
I have some business here.

662
00:33:07.386 --> 00:33:08.553
What, is he lost or what?
Thank you.

663
00:33:08.637 --> 00:33:09.845
Good to see you again, friend. How you doing?

664
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:10.888
Yeah. How you doing?

665
00:33:10.973 --> 00:33:12.557
My health is fine.
What more could a man ask for?

666
00:33:12.641 --> 00:33:13.599
Money and hair.

667
00:33:13.684 --> 00:33:14.892
Listen, I gotta
go to work now.

668
00:33:14.977 --> 00:33:16.060
What? Where? Here? In a sweatbox?

669
00:33:16.144 --> 00:33:17.144
Yeah.

670
00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:18.354
Can't be good
for the image.

671
00:33:18.438 --> 00:33:19.855
Urban light.
What are you gonna do?

672
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.399
Hey, Rocky, Rocky...
What'd you say?

673
00:33:21.483 --> 00:33:23.484
Urban light. It's "blight." Urban blight.

674
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:24.735
Rock, George would
like you to consider

675
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.153
putting on those
damn gloves again.

676
00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:27.905
It's a hell of
a payday.

677
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.407
Well, you know,
I'm officially expired.

678
00:33:29.491 --> 00:33:30.866
No, you do have
marquee value.

679
00:33:30.951 --> 00:33:32.743
You put butts in the
buckets, asses in the seats.

680
00:33:32.828 --> 00:33:34.412
A businessman with
any sort of brain

681
00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:36.747
don't retire when he can
still pull in the bread, baby.

682
00:33:36.832 --> 00:33:38.958
'Cause only in America do we
get these kind of opportunities.

683
00:33:39.042 --> 00:33:41.377
Union Cane's going for the title on the 14th.

684
00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:43.087
Yeah, here's some tickets. Be our guests.

685
00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:44.297
We have a strong
feeling about this one.

686
00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:45.506
Think he's gonna take it.

687
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:46.757
That's the time
to challenge.

688
00:33:46.842 --> 00:33:48.884
Because people
love comebacks,

689
00:33:48.969 --> 00:33:51.262
and there's nothing in the
boxing business more commercial

690
00:33:51.346 --> 00:33:52.597
than a long-shot comeback

691
00:33:52.681 --> 00:33:55.057
of a down-on-his-luck,
pure snow-white underdog.

692
00:33:55.142 --> 00:33:56.767
Now, like your
Mark Twain once said,

693
00:33:56.852 --> 00:33:59.312
"Virtue has never been
as respectable as money."

694
00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.855
Who's Twain?
He was a painter.

695
00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:03.566
Look, simply put,
you're the great white hope.

696
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:04.692
You mean great white dope.
No, forget it.

697
00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:05.776
No, no,
Rock, Rock...

698
00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:06.944
I ain't emotionally
involved in boxing...

699
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:08.863
Hey, hold it.
Hold the bullshit.

700
00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:10.948
I know what the problem is.
You think I was born yesterday?

701
00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:12.325
Merlin, show him
the paper.

702
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.118
What paper? Now, this is your medical report.

703
00:34:14.202 --> 00:34:16.245
It's not so good, but we can work around it.

704
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.288
Where'd you get this?

705
00:34:17.372 --> 00:34:18.623
It really doesn't matter,
does it, Rock?

706
00:34:18.707 --> 00:34:20.625
You agree to fight Cane,
and George here can guarantee

707
00:34:20.709 --> 00:34:22.168
you get licensed in any
country around the world.

708
00:34:22.252 --> 00:34:23.878
Guaranteed.
You can do this?

709
00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:24.962
No problem.

710
00:34:25.047 --> 00:34:26.922
His comeback's in the bag
and worth millions.

711
00:34:27.007 --> 00:34:29.383
The time is hot, the deal is hot. Caliente!

712
00:34:29.468 --> 00:34:31.260
We could use one more payday. I agree!

713
00:34:31.345 --> 00:34:32.595
Adrian, where'd
you come from?

714
00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.846
What do you
think you're going?

715
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:36.098
Mrs. Balboa just appeared.
This woman is magic.

716
00:34:36.183 --> 00:34:37.642
Look, I don't think
you're very funny.

717
00:34:37.726 --> 00:34:39.602
Are you trying to talk my
husband into fighting again?

718
00:34:39.686 --> 00:34:41.228
We're talking business,
now, darling.

719
00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:43.230
Do you like feeling hard up?

720
00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:45.941
Do you like reaching in your
pocket and only feeling your leg?

721
00:34:46.026 --> 00:34:47.985
Well, do you?
I didn't think so.

722
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.196
I'm offering you your last golden opportunity

723
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.572
to dump this loser image.

724
00:34:51.657 --> 00:34:52.865
Who you talking to?

725
00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.241
Hey, Adrian, you weren't working across...

726
00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:57.453
Hey, what the hell are you
two people talking about?

727
00:34:57.537 --> 00:34:59.038
This is
a tremendous opportunity.

728
00:34:59.122 --> 00:35:00.581
Opportunity for who?

729
00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:03.209
For you to make money?
For him to be disabled?

730
00:35:03.293 --> 00:35:05.711
What would you do if the
choices were reversed?

731
00:35:06.129 --> 00:35:07.922
You have to
think about that.

732
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.925
Rocky, they don't
care about you.

733
00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:14.011
You want to get serious?
Let's get serious.

734
00:35:14.096 --> 00:35:16.681
You represent the dreams of the
long shots, the little people.

735
00:35:16.765 --> 00:35:18.307
The never-wills
identify with you,

736
00:35:18.392 --> 00:35:20.351
and identification is
the key to public success.

737
00:35:20.435 --> 00:35:23.354
You're a true champion, a true
product of the people. Now sell it.

738
00:35:23.438 --> 00:35:25.231
Sell it while
there are still buyers.

739
00:35:25.315 --> 00:35:26.315
They ain't
gonna last forever.

740
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.483
You say you're a fighter?
Then fight!

741
00:35:27.567 --> 00:35:29.485
You say you want a champion's do, then do it

742
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:32.196
and I'll make you so much
money you could swim in it!

743
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.906
You can swim,
can't you, darling?

744
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:35.574
What do you say?
Come on. Put it there.

745
00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:37.368
It's time to put some hustle
behind this muscle.

746
00:35:37.452 --> 00:35:40.371
He's done!
He's done fighting!

747
00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:49.797
You're a damn fool.

748
00:35:51.258 --> 00:35:54.218
Maybe we ought to sign Mrs.
Balboa to fight Cane, huh?

749
00:35:54.302 --> 00:35:57.346
Looks like she's the one with
the cojones in the family.

750
00:35:59.975 --> 00:36:03.102
Yo, you don't talk like that
in front of my wife, you know?

751
00:36:03.186 --> 00:36:05.104
That ain't no
park bench, boy.

752
00:36:09.192 --> 00:36:10.526
I'll get him.

753
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.987
Rocky, I'm really sorry.
I didn't wanna...

754
00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:14.989
Hey, you guys
want privacy now?

755
00:36:15.073 --> 00:36:16.198
I'll be upstairs.

756
00:36:20.203 --> 00:36:21.287
Rocky...

757
00:36:22.664 --> 00:36:24.832
Rocky, I'm sorry.
I... I...

758
00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.377
But, you know, it just takes one
bad hit, and you could be an invalid.

759
00:36:28.462 --> 00:36:30.337
Well, I feel like
an invalid already, Adrian.

760
00:36:30.422 --> 00:36:31.589
Why'd you gotta
come back here?

761
00:36:31.673 --> 00:36:33.382
You're too smart
for this place here.

762
00:36:33.467 --> 00:36:35.092
I got nothing to do.

763
00:36:35.177 --> 00:36:36.927
Gloria. I called Gloria.

764
00:36:37.012 --> 00:36:39.597
She said, you know, she
could use some part-time help.

765
00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:41.182
Yeah, but why do you
wanna do this, Adrian?

766
00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:43.392
Why do you wanna go back to
the same place you started from?

767
00:36:43.477 --> 00:36:45.478
I gotta do it,
but you don't gotta do it!

768
00:36:45.562 --> 00:36:49.023
I wanted to be there so
I could be close to you.

769
00:36:58.408 --> 00:36:59.950
All right. Yeah.

770
00:37:00.035 --> 00:37:02.203
You know, it's getting a
little cold out here. Maybe...

771
00:37:02.287 --> 00:37:03.996
Okay. Maybe you
better get inside, okay?

772
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.122
I understand.

773
00:37:05.207 --> 00:37:06.999
Are you all right?
What?

774
00:37:07.083 --> 00:37:08.083
Are you all right?

775
00:37:08.168 --> 00:37:09.794
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm fine.

776
00:37:09.878 --> 00:37:11.629
Hey, it's getting cold, okay?

777
00:37:17.886 --> 00:37:21.680
Yo, Adrian!
Did we ever leave this place?

778
00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:26.227
I don't know!

779
00:37:31.733 --> 00:37:33.526
Hey, mind if I
talk to you now?

780
00:37:34.694 --> 00:37:36.987
My head's
a little busy right now.

781
00:37:48.959 --> 00:37:50.167
George, I don't know
if you're gonna get him.

782
00:37:50.252 --> 00:37:51.961
This guy, Balboa, he don't
think straight anymore.

783
00:37:52.045 --> 00:37:53.963
None of these bums think straight,
but all I need is an angle.

784
00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:55.840
I'll fight Balboa right now. Hey...

785
00:37:55.924 --> 00:37:57.341
I'm better than
Balboa ever was.

786
00:37:57.425 --> 00:37:58.759
Hey, hey!

787
00:38:00.262 --> 00:38:03.222
I own the paper on you, boy.
You will fight who I tell you,

788
00:38:03.306 --> 00:38:06.267
where I tell you, and how
I tell you, you got that?

789
00:38:07.727 --> 00:38:10.271
Don't aggravate the hand that feeds you, huh?

790
00:38:10.438 --> 00:38:11.438
All right?

791
00:38:14.067 --> 00:38:16.110
None of these bums
think straight.

792
00:38:20.782 --> 00:38:22.283
All I need is a hook.

793
00:38:34.129 --> 00:38:36.255
Hey, ain't you Rocky's kid?

794
00:38:36.965 --> 00:38:38.007
Yeah, you're
Rocky's kid.

795
00:38:38.091 --> 00:38:39.258
You're Rocky's
kid, right?

796
00:38:39.342 --> 00:38:40.384
Yeah, how you doing?

797
00:38:40.468 --> 00:38:41.969
Yeah, I seen your
picture in the paper.

798
00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:43.220
And you know what?

799
00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:44.972
Your old man's a punk.
What?

800
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.142
Get off me!

801
00:38:48.226 --> 00:38:50.102
And what are you
wearing my coat for?

802
00:38:50.186 --> 00:38:51.395
Just leave him alone!

803
00:38:51.479 --> 00:38:52.897
You want a beating too?

804
00:38:52.981 --> 00:38:55.232
Give me my coat! I'm not
kidding around anymore!

805
00:38:55.317 --> 00:38:56.984
You better let him have it. No way!

806
00:39:03.617 --> 00:39:05.326
Don't get sick now!

807
00:39:05.952 --> 00:39:08.329
Hope you don't
catch cold, rich boy!

808
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.250
Keep it high.
Slipping and sliding.

809
00:39:13.335 --> 00:39:15.252
Slip the jab.
That's it. Come on.

810
00:39:15.337 --> 00:39:16.503
That don't interest you?
This cup?

811
00:39:16.588 --> 00:39:18.839
Rocky drinks out of it
around the house. Ten bucks.

812
00:39:18.924 --> 00:39:20.716
Well, hey, man. How I
know it's the real thing?

813
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.426
Look at the
lip marks, huh?

814
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.386
All right, five bucks.
Five bucks. No more.

815
00:39:24.471 --> 00:39:25.888
You got a deal.
Okay.

816
00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:27.848
Excuse me.

817
00:39:27.933 --> 00:39:28.933
Tommy Gunn!

818
00:39:29.017 --> 00:39:30.267
Is there
someplace I can change?

819
00:39:30.352 --> 00:39:31.852
In there.
Give me the money.

820
00:39:31.937 --> 00:39:34.980
Time! Hey, Richard, Richard,
good friend, listen to me.

821
00:39:35.065 --> 00:39:37.608
If you wanna survive, you gotta
learn to slip the jab, you know?

822
00:39:37.692 --> 00:39:40.569
Keep it high, and hit
and not get hit, you know?

823
00:39:40.654 --> 00:39:41.862
Okay, take off.

824
00:39:41.947 --> 00:39:43.030
Rocko?
Yeah?

825
00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.949
Remember Tommy Gunn?
Yeah, yeah.

826
00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:47.576
He says he wants to fight.
I told him to get married.

827
00:39:47.661 --> 00:39:48.744
Why?

828
00:39:49.371 --> 00:39:50.913
That's gym humor, Rocko.

829
00:39:50.997 --> 00:39:52.831
That... Okay.

830
00:39:53.249 --> 00:39:55.542
Hey, let's see what
you got there, kid.

831
00:39:56.336 --> 00:39:57.711
Get married, eh?

832
00:39:58.338 --> 00:40:00.631
Benson,
wanna move a little?

833
00:40:00.715 --> 00:40:01.715
Yeah, all right.

834
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.092
Hey, Paulie,

835
00:40:03.176 --> 00:40:04.718
what's a cojones?

836
00:40:05.428 --> 00:40:10.474
Cojones? Cojones is
Latin for Spanish nuts.

837
00:40:10.558 --> 00:40:11.642
Yo, Rock.

838
00:40:11.726 --> 00:40:13.560
- We're ready.
- Wonderful.

839
00:40:15.063 --> 00:40:17.856
Hey kid,
you got the headgear?

840
00:40:17.941 --> 00:40:19.984
Nah, I don't
need one. Nah.

841
00:40:21.528 --> 00:40:23.821
He's gonna get his
cojones knocked out.

842
00:40:24.364 --> 00:40:26.156
Okay. Ready, guy?

843
00:40:26.241 --> 00:40:28.534
Benson, go easy, all right?

844
00:40:28.618 --> 00:40:30.536
Sure. Okay, Rock.
Time.

845
00:40:31.454 --> 00:40:33.914
All right.
Just go easy now.

846
00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:35.666
Slip the jab now.

847
00:40:37.502 --> 00:40:38.502
Go easy.

848
00:40:38.586 --> 00:40:39.670
Hey, kid.
What's his name again?

849
00:40:39.754 --> 00:40:41.338
Tommy Gunn.
Tommy Gunn.

850
00:40:41.423 --> 00:40:44.466
Tommy. Whoa!
It ain't no law to duck.

851
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:45.551
That's it.

852
00:40:45.635 --> 00:40:47.052
Go side to side.
That's it.

853
00:40:47.303 --> 00:40:50.347
Whoa! All right,
that's enough.

854
00:40:50.432 --> 00:40:52.182
Hey, man!
Take it easy, man!

855
00:40:52.267 --> 00:40:53.809
Hey, come on,
you guys, lighten up.

856
00:40:53.893 --> 00:40:55.853
It's called sparring.
Now, go on easy.

857
00:40:55.937 --> 00:40:57.396
Whoa! Hey, hey!

858
00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.023
Okay, okay.

859
00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:01.191
Hey, lighten up!
That's it. Tie him up.

860
00:41:01.276 --> 00:41:02.568
That's it.
You smell that, Rocko?

861
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.486
What's that? That's the odor of opportunity.

862
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:05.988
Hey, that's it.

863
00:41:06.072 --> 00:41:07.865
What'd I tell you?
Hey, hey! Time!

864
00:41:07.949 --> 00:41:09.783
Hey, that's it! Time!

865
00:41:09.868 --> 00:41:11.285
- Chill out, man!
- Call time!

866
00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:13.328
Time!
Hey! Hey, back off!

867
00:41:13.413 --> 00:41:15.873
Hey, that's enough!
What's the matter with you?

868
00:41:15.957 --> 00:41:17.458
Tommy, are you crazy
or something?

869
00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:18.959
Hey, what's
the matter with you, man?

870
00:41:19.044 --> 00:41:20.461
Get out of the ring.
I'm sorry.

871
00:41:20.545 --> 00:41:21.545
Get out of the ring.
Cool off, kid.

872
00:41:21.629 --> 00:41:22.921
All right.
I'm sorry about this.

873
00:41:23.006 --> 00:41:24.965
He stinks of opportunity,
Rocko.

874
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.550
Hey, look.

875
00:41:26.634 --> 00:41:28.886
Going easy don't mean
breaking bones, kid.

876
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.554
Man, I'm sorry.
But what do you think?

877
00:41:30.638 --> 00:41:33.223
What do I think? I don't
think you listen too good.

878
00:41:33.308 --> 00:41:36.060
But you, you fight, you brawl
like you was a street fighter,

879
00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:37.352
and I know
something about that.

880
00:41:37.437 --> 00:41:40.314
But this is called boxing.
This ain't no mugging, you know?

881
00:41:40.398 --> 00:41:42.066
I'm sorry. But I know I can do it all.

882
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.318
Yeah? Well, not
on this date, okay?

883
00:41:45.361 --> 00:41:46.445
That's it?

884
00:41:46.529 --> 00:41:48.447
Hey, yo, I gotta work
with these kids here.

885
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:49.907
You guys get ready.
Come on, one more.

886
00:41:49.991 --> 00:41:51.366
How about you
try to manage me?

887
00:41:51.451 --> 00:41:52.451
Manage?

888
00:41:52.535 --> 00:41:56.163
Yeah, unless you think
I ain't got nothing going.

889
00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.873
Man, got nothing going?

890
00:41:57.957 --> 00:42:00.542
Yeah, all right, you got a lot
going. You got a lot of tools.

891
00:42:00.627 --> 00:42:03.253
But I ain't no manager.
I ain't never been...

892
00:42:03.338 --> 00:42:05.255
You know,
the gentleman that owned this place,

893
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.423
that was a manager.

894
00:42:06.508 --> 00:42:10.511
But, me,
I was always the managed guy.

895
00:42:11.179 --> 00:42:13.514
Hey, look.
Good luck, all right?

896
00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.726
All right, guys.
Let's go.

897
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:19.978
Come on,
move around.

898
00:42:22.023 --> 00:42:23.774
That's it. Nice.

899
00:42:36.746 --> 00:42:38.205
All right, you guys, come on.

900
00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:40.040
No cheap shots.
Move it around.

901
00:42:47.632 --> 00:42:49.133
How you doing?

902
00:42:50.009 --> 00:42:52.553
Cold? You look cold.

903
00:42:53.555 --> 00:42:56.140
I guess it has something
to do with the weather.

904
00:42:57.892 --> 00:42:59.601
Here, take my coat.

905
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.689
No, thanks.
Where's your boyfriend?

906
00:43:04.232 --> 00:43:07.234
Him. Forget it. He ain't got no manners.

907
00:43:08.987 --> 00:43:11.321
I'm Jewel,
if you wanna know.

908
00:43:13.074 --> 00:43:15.159
I'm Robert.

909
00:43:15.243 --> 00:43:16.493
Hi.

910
00:43:17.787 --> 00:43:20.414
Well, I been living here
about six years now.

911
00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:23.625
It ain't Disneyland.

912
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.252
You been to Disneyland?

913
00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.461
Sure.

914
00:43:26.588 --> 00:43:29.131
You make it sound
like everybody has.

915
00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:31.341
I know you can't tell
by the way I look,

916
00:43:31.426 --> 00:43:33.969
but I ain't like the other kids around here.

917
00:43:34.971 --> 00:43:37.764
Why? I mean, what makes you so different?

918
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:38.891
I don't know.

919
00:43:38.975 --> 00:43:40.017
I guess it's
'cause I wanna get out.

920
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:41.894
You know how it is.

921
00:43:43.688 --> 00:43:48.483
You know, for an Italian kid,
you ain't got a bad butt.

922
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:51.612
Shut up, man.
Let's go. Come on.

923
00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:59.870
First money I get,
I'm going to Miami.

924
00:43:59.954 --> 00:44:01.205
Why Miami?

925
00:44:01.289 --> 00:44:03.123
Miami needs
new gigolos.

926
00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:05.375
Yeah, I read
something like that.

927
00:44:05.835 --> 00:44:07.002
Ow.

928
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.130
My back is getting bad.

929
00:44:10.215 --> 00:44:12.174
How come you
don't have arthritis?

930
00:44:12.258 --> 00:44:13.383
Yo, ain't I got enough?

931
00:44:13.468 --> 00:44:15.135
Hey,
watch where you're going.

932
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.012
Adrian's too good for this.

933
00:44:18.264 --> 00:44:20.557
This place is really depressing,
Paulie, you know? It's...

934
00:44:20.642 --> 00:44:21.642
Yo, Rock,
come inside.

935
00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:23.769
Everybody's been asking
for you. You too, Paulie.

936
00:44:23.853 --> 00:44:25.520
Hey, no, thanks.
I'm a little beat.

937
00:44:25.605 --> 00:44:27.147
I'm a little thirsty.

938
00:44:27.232 --> 00:44:28.398
Hey, you go if you want to, Paulie.

939
00:44:28.483 --> 00:44:29.441
Mr. Balboa?

940
00:44:29.525 --> 00:44:31.193
Look at this.
Tommy Gunn.

941
00:44:31.277 --> 00:44:32.861
Yo, why you still
hanging around, kid?

942
00:44:32.946 --> 00:44:34.905
Is there something
I can do for you?

943
00:44:34.989 --> 00:44:37.324
Yeah. I'd like
to try again.

944
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:39.826
Hey, kid, you know,
I'd like to help you out,

945
00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:41.995
but I really don't know
nothing about no managing.

946
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.580
All I'm asking
for is a chance.

947
00:44:43.665 --> 00:44:45.249
Man, if I screw up or do
something you don't like,

948
00:44:45.333 --> 00:44:47.042
man, you don't have to throw
me out. Hell, I'll leave.

949
00:44:47.126 --> 00:44:48.252
What have you
got to lose?

950
00:44:48.336 --> 00:44:50.128
Me? Nothing. I ain't got nothing to lose.

951
00:44:50.213 --> 00:44:51.255
It's what you got to lose.

952
00:44:51.339 --> 00:44:52.714
And I got nothing to lose.

953
00:44:52.799 --> 00:44:53.924
Maybe you do. Like, look,

954
00:44:54.008 --> 00:44:55.384
what if I don't
do good, right?

955
00:44:55.468 --> 00:44:57.302
You know,
and you don't make it?

956
00:44:57.387 --> 00:45:00.555
I don't want you blaming me
for this, kid, you know?

957
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.266
You know,
here's what I would do if I was you.

958
00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:03.350
No, listen to me.

959
00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:05.435
If I was you,
here's what I would do.

960
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.188
I would go home, and I'd
talk to your family people.

961
00:45:08.273 --> 00:45:10.107
Maybe you could come up with
something better, you know?

962
00:45:10.191 --> 00:45:11.608
I got no family people.

963
00:45:11.693 --> 00:45:13.568
Man, all I got is
what you see here.

964
00:45:13.653 --> 00:45:14.820
Man, I know everything about you

965
00:45:14.904 --> 00:45:17.030
from back when you had your
first fight with Apollo Creed.

966
00:45:17.156 --> 00:45:18.782
Yeah. I read how nobody cared about you,

967
00:45:18.866 --> 00:45:20.409
how no one ever
gave you a chance.

968
00:45:20.493 --> 00:45:22.452
And I realize I don't come
from the same streets as you do,

969
00:45:22.537 --> 00:45:24.413
but I'm hungry
like you were.

970
00:45:24.497 --> 00:45:25.747
And ever since
I put on gloves,

971
00:45:25.832 --> 00:45:27.040
I've been
waiting to meet you,

972
00:45:27.125 --> 00:45:30.210
'cause I knew that if anybody
could make me a winner, it was you.

973
00:45:31.129 --> 00:45:34.464
Winner. Hey, Paulie, you
see a winner standing here?

974
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:36.425
Yes! Man,
you beat the best!

975
00:45:36.509 --> 00:45:38.176
Nobody could ever
say any different.

976
00:45:38.261 --> 00:45:40.178
Look, Rock,
you don't know me,

977
00:45:40.263 --> 00:45:42.431
but anything you want me to do, I'll do.

978
00:45:42.515 --> 00:45:45.058
And if I can't,
I'll bust my butt trying.

979
00:45:45.143 --> 00:45:46.518
Man, I'm not
hustling you, man.

980
00:45:46.602 --> 00:45:48.603
All I'm asking
for is a chance.

981
00:45:48.688 --> 00:45:50.147
Man, just one shot.

982
00:46:00.992 --> 00:46:02.576
Are you hungry?

983
00:46:04.746 --> 00:46:06.121
Yeah.

984
00:46:06.205 --> 00:46:07.331
Yeah?

985
00:46:08.082 --> 00:46:09.291
Come on.

986
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:12.294
You're really gonna like the
way Adrian cooks, you know.

987
00:46:12.378 --> 00:46:15.088
She does, like, amazing things with macaroni,

988
00:46:15.173 --> 00:46:16.214
especially tomatoes.

989
00:46:16.299 --> 00:46:17.799
But I gotta warn you.

990
00:46:17.884 --> 00:46:19.926
She can be a little
vicious with the garlic.

991
00:46:22.597 --> 00:46:25.098
So, why'd this kid
smack your face for?

992
00:46:25.183 --> 00:46:26.641
It really doesn't matter, Dad. Sorry.

993
00:46:26.726 --> 00:46:27.726
Hell, sure, it matters.

994
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.394
It does matter.
They took his coat.

995
00:46:29.479 --> 00:46:30.937
No. They... Look, I don't want the coat.

996
00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:32.314
They took the one
with the collar?

997
00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:34.024
I'm gonna go to your
school tomorrow and just...

998
00:46:34.108 --> 00:46:35.817
Yeah, you should. You'll only
make things worse if you go.

999
00:46:35.902 --> 00:46:36.985
Can't I do what
I think is right?

1000
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:38.695
Well, you know, what do you think is right?

1001
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.572
A baseball bat across
the face would be nice.

1002
00:46:40.656 --> 00:46:42.032
Paulie, what are
you telling this kid?

1003
00:46:42.116 --> 00:46:43.241
Adrian, can I have
the plate?

1004
00:46:43.326 --> 00:46:44.534
I'm sorry, yes, Rocky.

1005
00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:46.870
You know, I had trouble one
time when I was in school.

1006
00:46:46.954 --> 00:46:49.164
It seemed like every day
I got chased by this one kid,

1007
00:46:49.248 --> 00:46:51.291
till one day my mother
said to me, she said,

1008
00:46:51.376 --> 00:46:53.126
"Just pretend
the guy's like a balloon."

1009
00:46:53.211 --> 00:46:54.419
Balloon?

1010
00:46:54.504 --> 00:46:57.381
She said if you pop him hard,
these guys just go away.

1011
00:47:00.134 --> 00:47:02.552
Tommy, we're trying to raise our son

1012
00:47:02.637 --> 00:47:05.097
so he can handle
his problems with his mind,

1013
00:47:05.181 --> 00:47:06.473
not his muscles.

1014
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:08.141
Sorry.

1015
00:47:08.226 --> 00:47:09.226
That's why I'm
gonna get mangled.

1016
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.228
No, you ain't gonna
get mangled.

1017
00:47:11.312 --> 00:47:13.063
Dad, will you
teach me how to fight?

1018
00:47:13.147 --> 00:47:14.815
A baseball bat
would be nice.

1019
00:47:14.899 --> 00:47:17.818
Come on. Do you want to grow
up and just use your fists?

1020
00:47:17.902 --> 00:47:20.278
You know, Adrian, I don't
think it would be so bad

1021
00:47:20.363 --> 00:47:24.741
if I taught him how to throw
a few deadly punches, you know.

1022
00:47:24.826 --> 00:47:26.743
Tommy, did your Dad
teach you how to fight?

1023
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.412
No. Not exactly.
I had to...

1024
00:47:28.496 --> 00:47:29.538
What?

1025
00:47:29.622 --> 00:47:30.705
Come on, sweetheart,
don't get personal.

1026
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:31.790
No, it's okay.

1027
00:47:31.874 --> 00:47:35.043
See, my old man, he used
to drink a lot, seriously.

1028
00:47:35.128 --> 00:47:37.421
He'd go out with his
friends and tie one on,

1029
00:47:37.505 --> 00:47:39.089
then he'd come home
and look to punch on me.

1030
00:47:39.173 --> 00:47:41.425
You know, he'd punch on my mother, too.

1031
00:47:41.509 --> 00:47:43.176
He did that
a lot of times.

1032
00:47:43.261 --> 00:47:45.595
You know, so, growing up, I never
really thought about fighting anybody

1033
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.888
but my father.

1034
00:47:46.973 --> 00:47:50.016
You know, when I was 13,
I got in trouble at school.

1035
00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:52.269
He tied me down
and he whipped me so bad

1036
00:47:52.353 --> 00:47:53.645
I couldn't walk for a week.

1037
00:47:53.729 --> 00:47:55.188
Just couldn't do anything.

1038
00:47:56.399 --> 00:47:59.317
But, I tell you, the first guy
I ever knocked out was my father.

1039
00:47:59.402 --> 00:48:02.946
And now when I get in the ring,
it's like all I see is him.

1040
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:05.157
That's kind of sick, huh?

1041
00:48:05.992 --> 00:48:07.659
Hey, yo, Tommy.
At least you had

1042
00:48:07.743 --> 00:48:09.536
an old man to
knock out, you know.

1043
00:48:11.998 --> 00:48:13.165
Yeah.

1044
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.501
Some of us didn't even
have that, you know?

1045
00:48:16.586 --> 00:48:18.336
Yeah, someday you could
punch out your pop.

1046
00:48:18.421 --> 00:48:21.089
Hey, yo, Paulie, what are you
telling the kid things like this?

1047
00:48:21.174 --> 00:48:23.049
Hey, it's fittest
of the survival.

1048
00:48:24.469 --> 00:48:25.760
Hey, Tommy,

1049
00:48:25.845 --> 00:48:27.596
where you staying tonight?
You got a place?

1050
00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.223
I'll find someplace to stay.
I mean...

1051
00:48:30.308 --> 00:48:32.601
No, I tell you, we got
room down in the basement.

1052
00:48:32.685 --> 00:48:33.685
It's not...
It's nice, I don't know.

1053
00:48:33.769 --> 00:48:34.769
What about me?

1054
00:48:34.854 --> 00:48:37.063
Wait, now, sweetheart. Your
son is sleeping down there.

1055
00:48:37.148 --> 00:48:39.858
No, well, he can stay
with his uncle, right?

1056
00:48:39.942 --> 00:48:41.109
What the hell am I?
A pit stop?

1057
00:48:41.235 --> 00:48:43.236
No... Hey, I don't
want to cause any problems.

1058
00:48:43.321 --> 00:48:44.571
I mean, I can find someplace to stay.

1059
00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:46.198
No, it's okay.
You know, it's just

1060
00:48:46.282 --> 00:48:49.451
for a little while,
you know, right?

1061
00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:51.161
No problem at all. You
know, it'll be all right.

1062
00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:53.705
Hey, kid, I appreciate it. Is
that all right? It's cold outside.

1063
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:55.332
Hey, I'm not
changing no sheets.

1064
00:48:55.416 --> 00:48:57.667
Hey, since when
have you ever?

1065
00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:00.128
Hey, Tommy, why don't
you come on down

1066
00:49:00.213 --> 00:49:02.631
and we'll show
you the whole place?

1067
00:49:02.715 --> 00:49:03.924
Sweetheart, why don't you go downstairs,

1068
00:49:04.008 --> 00:49:05.008
show your Father
what you did today?

1069
00:49:05.092 --> 00:49:06.927
Come on. Come on.

1070
00:49:11.557 --> 00:49:14.059
Hey, junior, your plumbing
don't leak, do it?

1071
00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:22.734
You know this guy?

1072
00:49:22.818 --> 00:49:24.402
Yeah. He hits hard.

1073
00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:28.865
You know, Adrian,
man, she can really cook.

1074
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:30.033
Yeah,
she's okay.

1075
00:49:30.117 --> 00:49:31.660
Listen, Tommy,
we ain't had a chance

1076
00:49:31.744 --> 00:49:34.538
to get this place
too nice, so...

1077
00:49:34.622 --> 00:49:36.998
I'll get it together in
a little while, you know.

1078
00:49:38.042 --> 00:49:40.502
Wow, man! This is what it's all about!

1079
00:49:40.586 --> 00:49:41.836
Holy mackerel...
Well, I...

1080
00:49:41.921 --> 00:49:44.130
Why do you keep
this stuff down here?

1081
00:49:44.215 --> 00:49:45.549
When did you get
a chance to do this?

1082
00:49:45.633 --> 00:49:46.800
He took
everything out of a box

1083
00:49:46.884 --> 00:49:48.385
and fixed this up like this.
It's beautiful!

1084
00:49:48.469 --> 00:49:52.097
And you painted! When'd you
get a chance to do this, kid?

1085
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:54.057
After school.
It's no big deal.

1086
00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:56.059
If you don't mind me asking,
where'd you get the glove?

1087
00:49:56.143 --> 00:49:57.143
This?
Yeah.

1088
00:49:57.228 --> 00:49:59.187
Thanks. This is one
of my favorite objects.

1089
00:49:59.272 --> 00:50:02.107
You know, like, Mickey give
me this before he departed.

1090
00:50:02.191 --> 00:50:04.693
It was Rocky Marciano's
cufflink that we had fixed.

1091
00:50:04.777 --> 00:50:06.861
Really? The real Rocky Marciano? Yeah.

1092
00:50:06.946 --> 00:50:08.697
Yeah. You know, you got me
thinking about Mick.

1093
00:50:08.781 --> 00:50:10.282
I wanna show you something.
Come on.

1094
00:50:10.366 --> 00:50:13.994
He told me a long time ago.
He says that,

1095
00:50:15.121 --> 00:50:17.789
fightin' is like,
90% in the skull

1096
00:50:17.873 --> 00:50:19.165
and 10% in the body.

1097
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:20.458
This is what
he says to me.

1098
00:50:20.543 --> 00:50:23.461
Hey, Dad, I met this really
nice girl today. She's great.

1099
00:50:23.546 --> 00:50:24.629
Yeah? Really?
That's wonderful.

1100
00:50:24.714 --> 00:50:26.965
Yeah, she's a lot
better than Sarah.

1101
00:50:27.049 --> 00:50:28.508
Hey,
don't change the station.

1102
00:50:28.593 --> 00:50:29.968
I'll be right back with you.

1103
00:50:30.052 --> 00:50:32.846
I just wanna tell Tommy
a few things, you know? Hey.

1104
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.849
Who was your best
friend back in Orlando?

1105
00:50:35.933 --> 00:50:38.143
That's...
That's Oklahoma.

1106
00:50:38.227 --> 00:50:40.186
Right, well, yeah.
Eric Elder.

1107
00:50:40.271 --> 00:50:44.399
No, no, no. No, your best friend
is a guy named Frankie Fear.

1108
00:50:44.483 --> 00:50:47.152
You see, fear is
a fighter's best friend.

1109
00:50:47.236 --> 00:50:49.195
You know, but it ain't
nothing to be ashamed of.

1110
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.198
See, fear keeps you sharp,
it keeps you awake,

1111
00:50:52.283 --> 00:50:54.326
you know, it makes you want to
survive. You know what I mean?

1112
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:57.787
But the thing is, you gotta learn
how to control it. All right?

1113
00:50:57.872 --> 00:50:59.789
'Cause fear is like
this fire, all right?

1114
00:50:59.874 --> 00:51:01.666
And it's burning deep inside.

1115
00:51:01.751 --> 00:51:05.086
Now, if you control it,
Tommy, it's gonna make you hot.

1116
00:51:05.171 --> 00:51:07.672
But, you see, if this
thing here, it controls you,

1117
00:51:07.757 --> 00:51:10.634
it's gonna burn you and
everything else around you up.

1118
00:51:10.718 --> 00:51:12.010
That's right, you know?

1119
00:51:12.094 --> 00:51:15.597
Anyway, these are the
things that was taught to me,

1120
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:18.558
and if you want,
I'd like to teach to you.

1121
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:21.853
So, this... This mean
you're gonna manage me?

1122
00:51:21.937 --> 00:51:23.938
Absolutely.
Hey, home team! Okay!

1123
00:51:24.023 --> 00:51:25.273
All right! Yeah!

1124
00:51:25.358 --> 00:51:26.650
- Let's go for it.
- Hey, Rock,

1125
00:51:26.734 --> 00:51:28.818
as long as we're down here, do
you mind showing me a few things?

1126
00:51:28.903 --> 00:51:31.237
Sure, Tommy. I'm gonna
show you a lot of things.

1127
00:51:36.494 --> 00:51:39.537
Hey, rich boy, how much you
got in your pocket today?

1128
00:51:39.622 --> 00:51:41.373
Nothing.
Come on, let's have it.

1129
00:51:41.457 --> 00:51:42.832
Nothing. I got nothing.

1130
00:51:42.917 --> 00:51:44.376
Come on. Give me the money.

1131
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.794
Come on!

1132
00:51:45.878 --> 00:51:47.128
Hey, I gotta eat.

1133
00:51:47.213 --> 00:51:50.340
He's hungry. He's gotta eat. Well, eat this!

1134
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.636
I got it. I got it. Go.

1135
00:51:55.596 --> 00:51:58.598
Father Carmine! Yo!

1136
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.934
Father Carmine!

1137
00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:02.018
You know,
maybe he's not home.

1138
00:52:02.103 --> 00:52:03.687
No, priests is always home.

1139
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:05.146
Rocky!

1140
00:52:05.231 --> 00:52:06.356
Yo!

1141
00:52:08.567 --> 00:52:11.361
Well, I didn't want to
disturb you that much, Father.

1142
00:52:13.948 --> 00:52:14.989
Excellent.

1143
00:52:15.074 --> 00:52:16.991
Everything is perfect.
You know...

1144
00:52:17.076 --> 00:52:19.369
Father, this is my new friend, Tommy Gunn.

1145
00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:26.751
Well, I was wondering... You
know, Tommy here is a fighter,

1146
00:52:26.836 --> 00:52:28.586
and I'm supposed to be
his manager, you know?

1147
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:30.422
So I was wondering
if you could do me a favor,

1148
00:52:30.506 --> 00:52:31.715
you know,
if you ain't that busy.

1149
00:52:31.799 --> 00:52:34.134
If you could throw us down
a couple blessings, you know?

1150
00:52:34.218 --> 00:52:36.761
One, that I don't
mess up being a manager,

1151
00:52:36.846 --> 00:52:39.556
and B, that Tommy does as
good as I think he can do.

1152
00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.892
You know, great, and don't get
hurt none. Could you do that?

1153
00:52:51.152 --> 00:52:52.318
I love when he does that.

1154
00:52:52.403 --> 00:52:54.904
Hey, thanks, Father.
I really appreciate this.

1155
00:52:56.115 --> 00:52:57.115
Anytime.

1156
00:52:57.199 --> 00:52:58.992
Okay. Hey, I'll see you
in church!

1157
00:53:01.579 --> 00:53:02.579
Okay.

1158
00:53:02.663 --> 00:53:03.830
Hey, man, what'd you do this for?

1159
00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:06.374
Hey, it don't hurt having an
angel in your corner, you know?

1160
00:53:06.542 --> 00:53:07.584
Come on!

1161
00:53:11.714 --> 00:53:13.423
Hey, Rock,
how's it going?

1162
00:53:13.507 --> 00:53:14.632
Doing great, guys!

1163
00:53:14.717 --> 00:53:16.509
Better slow down, we're
gonna give you a ticket.

1164
00:53:16.594 --> 00:53:18.428
This is Tommy Gunn.
He's gonna be champ, guys.

1165
00:53:18.512 --> 00:53:19.679
How you doing, Tom?

1166
00:53:30.191 --> 00:53:32.984
Break it up. Break! Break! Break it!

1167
00:53:45.331 --> 00:53:46.498
Get off the ropes.

1168
00:53:54.507 --> 00:53:55.548
Just go easy, all right?

1169
00:53:55.633 --> 00:53:56.633
Man, I need more work.

1170
00:53:56.717 --> 00:53:58.301
No, no, no, you're ready.
No, I need more work.

1171
00:53:58.385 --> 00:53:59.511
This guy's killing me.

1172
00:53:59.553 --> 00:54:01.262
Now, listen to me. You're
ready now. He's killing me.

1173
00:54:01.347 --> 00:54:02.847
No, you're perfect,
you understanding me?

1174
00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:04.641
Man, I feel weak. I feel
weak. No, no, no. Listen to me.

1175
00:54:04.725 --> 00:54:05.767
Shut up! Listen to me.

1176
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:07.685
Mick used to say
the only difference

1177
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:10.814
between a hero and a coward is
the hero's willing to go for it.

1178
00:54:10.898 --> 00:54:12.482
All right? He's willing
to take the shot, okay?

1179
00:54:12.566 --> 00:54:13.942
Now, this guy over
here is scared, too.

1180
00:54:14.026 --> 00:54:15.735
You're scared. He's
scared. You're both scared.

1181
00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.987
Remember, in the basement,
when we was talking about fear

1182
00:54:18.072 --> 00:54:19.697
and how it's
like this fire, huh?

1183
00:54:19.782 --> 00:54:22.283
And you gotta control it 'cause
it's like, it'll, like, burn you up

1184
00:54:22.368 --> 00:54:23.660
or it's gonna burn him up.
All right?

1185
00:54:23.744 --> 00:54:25.745
Now, you gotta make it
work for you, Tommy, okay?

1186
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.622
I would never do nothing
that would hurt you.

1187
00:54:27.706 --> 00:54:28.915
You gotta understand
what I'm saying.

1188
00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:30.458
Now, fear is like
this fire, okay?

1189
00:54:30.543 --> 00:54:33.586
Now, let it burn and burn until
it becomes like this volcano,

1190
00:54:33.671 --> 00:54:35.672
and when the time is right,
and you see the opening,

1191
00:54:35.756 --> 00:54:37.340
explode all over
this guy, okay?

1192
00:54:37.424 --> 00:54:38.758
Now, you can take him, okay?

1193
00:54:38.801 --> 00:54:40.260
It's all heart, you understand? Okay. Got it.

1194
00:54:40.344 --> 00:54:42.512
It ain't all muscle, it's
all heart. Heart and fire.

1195
00:54:42.596 --> 00:54:43.847
Heart and fire! Okay.

1196
00:54:43.931 --> 00:54:44.889
Now you do it.

1197
00:54:47.601 --> 00:54:50.270
Remember, I'm like this angel
sitting on your shoulder, okay?

1198
00:54:50.354 --> 00:54:52.105
I ain't gonna let nothing
happen to you, okay?

1199
00:54:52.189 --> 00:54:53.189
Go!
Got it.

1200
00:54:54.525 --> 00:54:55.817
Go for it

1201
00:54:57.736 --> 00:54:59.445
Come on, Tommy, jab!

1202
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.702
Explode! Left, right!

1203
00:55:08.372 --> 00:55:09.497
The body! The body!

1204
00:55:10.624 --> 00:55:11.666
Hook!

1205
00:55:13.294 --> 00:55:14.252
All right!

1206
00:55:40.154 --> 00:55:41.237
Yeah!

1207
00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.453
Time!

1208
00:56:13.646 --> 00:56:15.688
Go to the body, Tommy.
Come on.

1209
00:56:15.773 --> 00:56:17.357
That's it,
that's it!

1210
00:56:18.442 --> 00:56:21.027
Sam, you okay?
Hey, Tommy Gunn.

1211
00:56:21.153 --> 00:56:23.696
You got some guns,
don't you? Paulie!

1212
00:56:23.781 --> 00:56:25.531
'Cause I know
you got the knack

1213
00:56:25.616 --> 00:56:27.450
To go farther than
you've ever been before

1214
00:56:27.534 --> 00:56:28.785
Rocky!

1215
00:56:31.288 --> 00:56:32.372
It's over.

1216
00:56:34.208 --> 00:56:36.209
18, 19.

1217
00:56:39.922 --> 00:56:43.174
Drive through it.
85. Go on, now.

1218
00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:54.477
And 10. Come on,
you can do it. That's it.

1219
00:56:56.814 --> 00:56:58.147
You got it.
Come on, bring it up.

1220
00:56:58.232 --> 00:56:59.524
Yeah!

1221
00:56:59.608 --> 00:57:01.651
I got you.
I got you this time.

1222
00:57:08.325 --> 00:57:09.325
Damn!

1223
00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:14.038
Yeah.

1224
00:57:14.123 --> 00:57:17.250
Tommy, you know, these trunks,
is, like, very special to me, you know?

1225
00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:20.837
Dig, dig, dig!

1226
00:57:24.633 --> 00:57:25.633
Hook!

1227
00:57:26.635 --> 00:57:27.719
Yeah!

1228
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:31.889
Way to go, kid! That was
great! That was great!

1229
00:57:32.224 --> 00:57:34.559
Tommy, Tommy!

1230
00:57:40.441 --> 00:57:41.607
Go for it

1231
00:57:43.944 --> 00:57:44.944
All right, kid.

1232
00:57:52.494 --> 00:57:54.495
Yeah! Whoo!

1233
00:57:55.539 --> 00:57:57.498
I beat the man!
I don't believe it!

1234
00:57:57.583 --> 00:57:59.083
You sure did.

1235
00:57:59.168 --> 00:58:00.918
You're very swift,
Tommy Gunn.

1236
00:58:10.637 --> 00:58:13.306
Yeah, Merlin, listen.
Got an idea.

1237
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.476
I think we can
finally nail Balboa.

1238
00:58:20.689 --> 00:58:22.315
They're waiting again.
Yeah.

1239
00:58:22.399 --> 00:58:24.525
If you don't got enough
money, I got almost a dollar.

1240
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:26.569
Save it.
Slumming again, bimbo?

1241
00:58:26.653 --> 00:58:28.237
Hey, barefoot,
what you got in the bag?

1242
00:58:28.322 --> 00:58:29.280
Shut up.

1243
00:58:29.364 --> 00:58:30.907
Hey, squaw, what? You're not talking to me?

1244
00:58:30.991 --> 00:58:32.992
Take two more steps and I'm
gonna pound your teeth out.

1245
00:58:33.494 --> 00:58:34.911
Go for it!

1246
00:58:34.995 --> 00:58:36.204
What'd he say?

1247
00:58:36.288 --> 00:58:38.706
The punk's losing his mind.
What'd you say?

1248
00:58:38.791 --> 00:58:40.374
- Go for it!
- Do it!

1249
00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:47.215
Kill him!

1250
00:58:57.768 --> 00:59:00.269
Come on! Put up your hands! Come on!

1251
00:59:00.354 --> 00:59:02.772
No way!
I didn't like him anyway!

1252
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:08.111
I think that belongs to me.

1253
00:59:08.195 --> 00:59:12.490
Robert! Robert! Robert!

1254
00:59:12.574 --> 00:59:14.534
If you wanna end this,
let's end it now.

1255
00:59:15.494 --> 00:59:17.662
Yeah, I got no problems with that.

1256
00:59:17.746 --> 00:59:19.330
See you later.
All right.

1257
00:59:20.749 --> 00:59:21.791
I can't believe it.

1258
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:23.376
Well, are you gonna tell your dad?

1259
00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.836
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.

1260
00:59:26.922 --> 00:59:28.881
Good, that's it.
One more time.

1261
00:59:29.883 --> 00:59:31.551
Yeah, yeah, look...
Hey, Tommy, Tommy,

1262
00:59:31.635 --> 00:59:33.302
you're doing
great combinations,

1263
00:59:33.387 --> 00:59:37.140
but you gotta learn to move side
to side, like a windshield wiper,

1264
00:59:37.224 --> 00:59:39.142
so you ain't getting kicked
in the face with his jabs.

1265
00:59:39.226 --> 00:59:40.518
Dad!
Back and forth, you know...

1266
00:59:40.602 --> 00:59:43.688
I got my coat back!
Look, I got my coat!

1267
00:59:43.772 --> 00:59:46.399
That's great, kid.
That's beautiful.

1268
00:59:46.483 --> 00:59:50.403
I trashed this guy. Everybody in
the school went crazy. Everybody!

1269
00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:51.946
Hey, Rock, man, I'm cooling down over here.

1270
00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:53.698
Hey, listen,
I gotta get back with Tommy

1271
00:59:53.782 --> 00:59:55.867
'cause we gotta work out. He's
cooling down and everything, but...

1272
00:59:55.951 --> 00:59:58.119
Listen, go tell your mom. She'd
like to hear things like that.

1273
00:59:58.203 --> 00:59:59.829
That's beautiful, you know.

1274
00:59:59.913 --> 01:00:01.747
Okay, let's go, Tommy.

1275
01:00:02.749 --> 01:00:05.376
Looking good!
Come on, lay it on me.

1276
01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.088
Look at Tommy go!
Look at Tommy go!

1277
01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.223
Union Cane, the new
heavyweight champion of the world...

1278
01:00:19.308 --> 01:00:20.558
You think I have
a chance at that?

1279
01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:21.767
Absolutely. You kidding?

1280
01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:26.230
Hey, Tommy, anybody's got two
fists, right, and a good heartbeat,

1281
01:00:26.315 --> 01:00:27.690
they got a chance, right?

1282
01:00:35.616 --> 01:00:36.657
You're out!

1283
01:00:46.668 --> 01:00:47.752
Go!

1284
01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:52.006
Come on, kid, 49.
Heads up!

1285
01:00:56.261 --> 01:00:57.678
Yeah!

1286
01:01:07.606 --> 01:01:08.689
Boy, you got hands of gold.

1287
01:01:08.774 --> 01:01:10.358
I want to introduce
you to somebody.

1288
01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:25.164
Go, Tommy!

1289
01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:32.004
Yeah!

1290
01:02:08.709 --> 01:02:10.376
- Yeah!
- That's it. It's over!

1291
01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:19.010
Tommy, back him up!

1292
01:02:25.684 --> 01:02:26.976
That's it!
Yeah!

1293
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.311
There's your boat, Rock.

1294
01:02:28.395 --> 01:02:30.313
What boat?
The one that's sinking.

1295
01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.205
Tommy Gunn at the top.

1296
01:02:49.791 --> 01:02:51.292
You come with the Duke,

1297
01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:53.878
you can get
the kind of payday fights

1298
01:02:53.962 --> 01:02:55.588
Balboa could
only dream about.

1299
01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.425
To the victor
goes the spoils.

1300
01:03:08.727 --> 01:03:10.061
Slip the jab, Tommy!

1301
01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:17.026
Yes!

1302
01:03:17.944 --> 01:03:18.986
You're out!

1303
01:03:22.115 --> 01:03:23.199
Yeah!
Great, kid.

1304
01:03:23.283 --> 01:03:24.408
You did it, man!
You did it! You did it!

1305
01:03:24.493 --> 01:03:26.243
Hey, man, now am I gonna
get a shot at the title?

1306
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.371
- Yeah, you're gonna get one real soon.
- Tommy, over here!

1307
01:03:28.497 --> 01:03:30.331
Hey, baby,
how are you?

1308
01:03:30.665 --> 01:03:33.250
The winner, at
two minutes and 10 seconds...

1309
01:03:33.335 --> 01:03:35.711
So, Rocky, when's Tommy
going up against Union Cane?

1310
01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:37.254
We gotta talk about that.

1311
01:03:37.297 --> 01:03:39.048
How does it feel to be a
manager? Get lost, will you?

1312
01:03:39.132 --> 01:03:41.008
Rocko, he ain't
worth it, buddy.

1313
01:03:41.093 --> 01:03:43.094
He fought a great fight,
you know, Paulie?

1314
01:03:43.178 --> 01:03:46.305
Your ship is sunk, Rocko.
It sunk, huh?

1315
01:04:02.614 --> 01:04:04.365
He probably got hung up in traffic, Adrian.

1316
01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:05.574
He should have
been here by now.

1317
01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:07.701
Why? Why? It's Christmas time.

1318
01:04:07.786 --> 01:04:09.245
He should be here
with his family.

1319
01:04:09.329 --> 01:04:11.497
Well, maybe he doesn't
think this is his family.

1320
01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:12.581
Sure it is.

1321
01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:13.666
Yo, Adrian, look.
Look at this.

1322
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.209
What?

1323
01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:18.838
I wanna give
this to him.

1324
01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:20.005
What do you think?

1325
01:04:21.007 --> 01:04:22.508
I think you've given enough.

1326
01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:24.510
Hey, come on, Adrian.

1327
01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.595
He's given us some
things too, you know?

1328
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.764
He's given us, like,
a second shot, right?

1329
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:30.057
Come on, it's Christmas.

1330
01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:35.187
That's right.
Only in America.

1331
01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.523
Having the best,
wearing the best.

1332
01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:39.567
But to keep it up,
you gotta stay on top.

1333
01:04:39.651 --> 01:04:41.110
Nobody remembers
number two, kiddo.

1334
01:04:41.194 --> 01:04:42.278
I sure don't.

1335
01:04:42.362 --> 01:04:45.239
Now, Tommy, I've checked
with the boxing commission.

1336
01:04:45.323 --> 01:04:48.576
It seems there's no formal
contract between you and Balboa.

1337
01:04:49.744 --> 01:04:51.829
No, nothing. Just a... Just a handshake.

1338
01:04:51.913 --> 01:04:55.624
Tommy, this is a complex business
and you got to stay sharp.

1339
01:04:55.709 --> 01:04:57.460
But I don't have to
tell you that, do I?

1340
01:04:57.544 --> 01:05:00.212
'Cause it gotta be damn difficult,
you living in Rocky's shadow,

1341
01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:01.589
people calling
you his puppet.

1342
01:05:01.673 --> 01:05:03.674
I don't know anybody who could
have done it as long as you have.

1343
01:05:03.758 --> 01:05:05.384
Tommy, I'm afraid.

1344
01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:08.137
I'm afraid that if you keep
going the way you're going,

1345
01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:10.389
you're gonna be watching
the parade go by.

1346
01:05:11.266 --> 01:05:12.266
Exactly.

1347
01:05:13.018 --> 01:05:15.144
Tommy, you haven't had
the big payday yet,

1348
01:05:15.228 --> 01:05:17.646
and you won't until you
fight those top contenders.

1349
01:05:17.731 --> 01:05:20.983
And those top contenders,
Tommy boy, I do surely own.

1350
01:05:21.067 --> 01:05:23.486
I got the contracts.

1351
01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:25.029
It's a complex business.

1352
01:05:25.947 --> 01:05:28.782
But if you want the best,
then go with the best.

1353
01:05:28.867 --> 01:05:30.451
Man, what about Rocky?
I mean...

1354
01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:31.660
Rocky can still train you.

1355
01:05:31.745 --> 01:05:33.621
My God,
he's done a wonderful job.

1356
01:05:33.705 --> 01:05:36.499
Now look here,
here's $20,000.

1357
01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:37.875
Take it as an advance.

1358
01:05:40.086 --> 01:05:42.254
Time to put some hustle
behind this muscle.

1359
01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:43.547
Merry Christmas.

1360
01:05:44.758 --> 01:05:46.342
Merry Christmas.

1361
01:05:47.802 --> 01:05:49.345
Whoa,
stop the presses!

1362
01:05:49.429 --> 01:05:52.014
Yo, Adrian, I can't believe
who just come up on the roof.

1363
01:05:52.098 --> 01:05:55.142
You know, hey, you know, he
just landed there and crashed.

1364
01:05:55.227 --> 01:05:56.352
And who do you
think it is?

1365
01:05:56.436 --> 01:05:58.395
Do I hear
reindeer on my roof?

1366
01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:01.023
You know...

1367
01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:02.107
Rantlers.

1368
01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:04.610
Unbelievable.
It's like a billion...

1369
01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:06.195
Whoa! Come on.

1370
01:06:06.279 --> 01:06:08.364
Look who's here!
You know this guy.

1371
01:06:08.448 --> 01:06:10.032
You got a weird family.

1372
01:06:10.116 --> 01:06:11.158
Don't I know.

1373
01:06:11.243 --> 01:06:13.202
It's gonna be next Christmas
before he gets down.

1374
01:06:13.286 --> 01:06:16.580
Hey, let's put it together for Santa! Hey!

1375
01:06:16.665 --> 01:06:18.332
Merry X-mas. Yo, yo, yo.

1376
01:06:18.416 --> 01:06:20.501
Hey, I don't think
you got it right, Santa.

1377
01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:23.629
No, no, no.
It's, "Ho, ho, ho."

1378
01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.755
What's
the freaking difference?

1379
01:06:24.839 --> 01:06:26.590
Where I come from,
it's, "Yo, yo, yo."

1380
01:06:26.675 --> 01:06:29.051
Looks like we got
a 90-proof Santa.

1381
01:06:29.135 --> 01:06:30.928
Hey, Santa,

1382
01:06:31.012 --> 01:06:33.722
tell all the kids what
you got in the bag for them

1383
01:06:33.807 --> 01:06:35.224
that you brought
from the North.

1384
01:06:35.308 --> 01:06:37.059
Yeah, I got my laundry.

1385
01:06:37.143 --> 01:06:38.727
No, you got the wrong bag.

1386
01:06:38.812 --> 01:06:40.813
Come on, chubby, get out
of the way. Yo, watch it.

1387
01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:42.064
Let Santa take a seat.

1388
01:06:42.482 --> 01:06:43.941
Come here, little boy.
You been nice?

1389
01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:46.068
Uncle Paulie! Come over here. Sit down here.

1390
01:06:46.152 --> 01:06:48.654
Hey, kid, why don't you tell
Santa what you need? What you...

1391
01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.072
He's stretching
the clothes, man.

1392
01:06:50.156 --> 01:06:51.407
I don't need nothing.

1393
01:06:51.491 --> 01:06:54.368
Hey, kid, tell Santa what
you really want. Come on.

1394
01:06:54.452 --> 01:06:57.746
That ain't Santa. It's
Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.

1395
01:06:57.831 --> 01:06:58.914
What do you mean,
"Get real"?

1396
01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:00.624
You know,
why you talking like that?

1397
01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:02.626
We're just trying
to have a good time,

1398
01:07:02.711 --> 01:07:04.962
and Santa's here
and everything and...

1399
01:07:05.046 --> 01:07:06.297
It's stupid!

1400
01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.883
Yo, you know, come on. It ain't stupid.

1401
01:07:09.968 --> 01:07:11.885
We're just trying
to pretend here.

1402
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:14.346
But you see,
you're supposed to be pretending.

1403
01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:16.890
It's like this game,
right? You know?

1404
01:07:16.975 --> 01:07:19.476
I don't like pretending. Why
don't you guys talk to Santa?

1405
01:07:19.561 --> 01:07:21.854
Hey, yo, kid, you know,
I ain't talking to them.

1406
01:07:21.938 --> 01:07:23.772
I'm talking with you,
here, you know.

1407
01:07:23.857 --> 01:07:27.276
See, it's very important that
you spend time with the family,

1408
01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.944
you know,
and have a good time and

1409
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:31.030
just getting the spirit going, you know...

1410
01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:32.114
It's good, right?

1411
01:07:32.198 --> 01:07:33.866
Good for what?
Come on, let's go.

1412
01:07:35.702 --> 01:07:38.454
Look, his friends are here.
Maybe he doesn't want to.

1413
01:07:38.538 --> 01:07:40.789
Adrian, I know
what he wants.

1414
01:07:40.874 --> 01:07:42.458
How do you know
what I want?

1415
01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:43.626
'Cause I know you.

1416
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:46.503
You know me?
He thinks he knows me.

1417
01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.424
Look, I ain't
celebrating nothing, okay?

1418
01:07:50.508 --> 01:07:51.842
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, yo, come here.

1419
01:07:51.926 --> 01:07:53.218
What's the matter
with you?

1420
01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:54.845
You know? We always done this before.

1421
01:07:54.929 --> 01:07:56.847
We always had a good time,
Adrian, you know?

1422
01:07:56.931 --> 01:07:58.390
We don't have to
change nothing, never.

1423
01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:00.476
I mean, do you
remember last year

1424
01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.062
when we had fun,
when we had a good time?

1425
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:06.649
It ain't last year, and
you ain't the same either.

1426
01:08:08.735 --> 01:08:09.777
What?

1427
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.741
Adrian, what...
What did I do?

1428
01:08:16.451 --> 01:08:17.576
Go talk to him.

1429
01:08:21.414 --> 01:08:23.832
Even I could've saw
this thing happening.

1430
01:08:23.917 --> 01:08:26.001
I should have went to Miami
when I had the chance.

1431
01:08:27.962 --> 01:08:30.422
You wanna talk,
let's talk.

1432
01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:35.302
You know, I thought we was
supposed to be, like, like,

1433
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.471
you know, be very close.

1434
01:08:37.555 --> 01:08:38.847
Hey, come on, kid.
I love you.

1435
01:08:38.932 --> 01:08:40.182
No, you don't.

1436
01:08:40.934 --> 01:08:43.602
Sure I do, you know? Do you
remember what the deal was?

1437
01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:47.606
We were supposed to be, like,
tight, like crossed fingers.

1438
01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:50.484
No, no, what you want is
you and Tommy to be tight.

1439
01:08:50.568 --> 01:08:51.610
That's who you're
really talking about.

1440
01:08:51.695 --> 01:08:52.695
Don't say that.

1441
01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.029
Why can't I say it?

1442
01:08:54.114 --> 01:08:56.532
Since he's been here, it's
been "Tommy this, Tommy that."

1443
01:08:56.616 --> 01:08:59.451
You don't have no time for
nobody, so I got no time for you.

1444
01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:00.869
Hey, what are you
saying to me, kid?

1445
01:09:00.954 --> 01:09:02.246
You're like another person.

1446
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:04.206
You're the other person!

1447
01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:05.791
You said I would be
number one to you!

1448
01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.042
You said that and you lied!

1449
01:09:07.127 --> 01:09:09.545
You lied to me
and you lied to Mom!

1450
01:09:09.629 --> 01:09:11.672
I never lied to you.

1451
01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:13.298
Tommy needed my help.

1452
01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:14.675
So did I.

1453
01:09:15.427 --> 01:09:18.637
And remember when you said to
watch out for scams and deceptions?

1454
01:09:19.305 --> 01:09:20.389
Yeah?

1455
01:09:20.932 --> 01:09:23.809
You're the one that should have watched out.

1456
01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.568
Where you going?
Out.

1457
01:09:32.652 --> 01:09:34.445
When are you coming back?
Later.

1458
01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:36.029
Later? When?

1459
01:09:36.114 --> 01:09:37.239
Later.

1460
01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:43.704
Season's greetings,
Mrs. Balboa.

1461
01:09:45.331 --> 01:09:46.749
You take care
of these people.

1462
01:09:48.835 --> 01:09:51.754
Behold,
a Santa for all seasons!

1463
01:09:53.506 --> 01:09:54.882
What, are you guys lost?

1464
01:09:55.633 --> 01:09:57.092
Au contraire,
mon ami.

1465
01:09:57.177 --> 01:09:59.011
I know exactly where I am.

1466
01:10:00.638 --> 01:10:02.181
Yo, Rocko!

1467
01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:03.932
Guess what's
coming to dinner?

1468
01:10:04.017 --> 01:10:05.934
Tommy Gunn's
got new friends.

1469
01:10:06.019 --> 01:10:08.061
New friends
for a new year.

1470
01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:12.357
Please. Paulie.

1471
01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:14.985
Nice tree. Charming.

1472
01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:17.821
Hey, Tommy, how you doing?

1473
01:10:17.906 --> 01:10:20.616
Merry Christmas, my lord.
Greetings!

1474
01:10:20.867 --> 01:10:21.825
Yeah, how you doing?

1475
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:24.328
Listen, I don't wanna
take up too much time.

1476
01:10:24.412 --> 01:10:26.413
I just wanted to come by and
give a little season's greetings.

1477
01:10:26.498 --> 01:10:27.456
I don't need no presents.

1478
01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.791
Give them to the neighbors.

1479
01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:31.710
Look, you've done a hell of a
job with the man. Facts are facts.

1480
01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:35.130
I'd have to be blind if I didn't
say a title shot isn't in the cards.

1481
01:10:35.215 --> 01:10:36.298
Title shot?

1482
01:10:36.382 --> 01:10:38.884
That's right, title shot. Now,
we're gonna work beautifully together.

1483
01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.219
No problems.

1484
01:10:40.887 --> 01:10:42.095
No friction.

1485
01:10:42.764 --> 01:10:44.765
Only harmony, huh?

1486
01:10:44.849 --> 01:10:47.142
It's time to put some
hustle behind this muscle.

1487
01:10:47.227 --> 01:10:49.478
Why, our Tommy boy here's got
a little something personal

1488
01:10:49.562 --> 01:10:50.938
to discuss with you.

1489
01:10:51.022 --> 01:10:53.023
So I'm gonna be
saying good night.

1490
01:10:53.107 --> 01:10:54.149
Merry Christmas.

1491
01:10:54.234 --> 01:10:55.359
Merry Christmas to you.

1492
01:10:56.027 --> 01:10:57.736
See you soon, huh?
Bye.

1493
01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:00.614
Sorry I'm late.
I ended up having dinner.

1494
01:11:00.698 --> 01:11:01.865
Let's go.

1495
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.742
Hey, that's okay,
Tommy, you know,

1496
01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:06.703
Adrian cooked something, but
it's probably all cold now.

1497
01:11:06.788 --> 01:11:09.289
What we can do is make
sandwiches. It's no big...

1498
01:11:09.374 --> 01:11:10.874
Rocky, I don't
wanna make sandwiches.

1499
01:11:10.959 --> 01:11:14.211
I don't wanna make... No. Tommy,
why did you bring him here?

1500
01:11:14.295 --> 01:11:15.754
He just wanted to come by.

1501
01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:17.631
Tommy... Rocky, do you mind
if I talk to you outside

1502
01:11:17.715 --> 01:11:19.132
about a few things?

1503
01:11:19.217 --> 01:11:20.759
Yeah, sure.

1504
01:11:21.261 --> 01:11:22.427
It's getting late.

1505
01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:23.679
We have to be
there by 10:00.

1506
01:11:23.763 --> 01:11:24.763
Rocky.

1507
01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:26.181
No, it's okay.

1508
01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:32.271
Hey, Tommy, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

1509
01:11:32.355 --> 01:11:33.355
Isnt it a long drive?

1510
01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:34.523
Yeah.

1511
01:11:34.607 --> 01:11:35.983
So, what do
you think?

1512
01:11:37.277 --> 01:11:38.527
Well, where'd you
get this from?

1513
01:11:38.611 --> 01:11:39.862
Duke gave it
to me.

1514
01:11:39.946 --> 01:11:41.113
Tommy!

1515
01:11:41.656 --> 01:11:42.739
Hey, you know,
maybe you ought to

1516
01:11:42.824 --> 01:11:44.324
give this thing back,
you know, Tom.

1517
01:11:44.409 --> 01:11:46.702
And I knew it.
I knew you were gonna say that.

1518
01:11:46.786 --> 01:11:48.036
Give it back? Why?

1519
01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:49.913
I mean, the guy
likes the way I fight.

1520
01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:51.707
It's almost 10:00.
All right. We'll make it.

1521
01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:55.168
I know, but, you know, you see
what he's doing here, Tommy?

1522
01:11:55.253 --> 01:11:57.504
Hey, don't let him put
nothing between us, okay?

1523
01:11:57.589 --> 01:11:58.630
We got something
good going here.

1524
01:11:58.715 --> 01:11:59.715
Put? Like what?

1525
01:11:59.799 --> 01:12:01.967
I mean, the guy was just
talking about getting a shot...

1526
01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:04.219
But we don't need him,
you know what I mean?

1527
01:12:04.304 --> 01:12:05.762
I mean,
you're gonna get a shot.

1528
01:12:05.847 --> 01:12:08.140
You're gonna be able to buy
10 of these things here.

1529
01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:09.892
Rock, when you
gonna wake up, man?

1530
01:12:09.976 --> 01:12:11.393
We're watching
the parade go by.

1531
01:12:11.477 --> 01:12:13.896
What parade?
What are you talking about?

1532
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.022
- What parade?
- The big time.

1533
01:12:15.106 --> 01:12:16.231
Man, the way I'm going,
I'm not gonna get

1534
01:12:16.316 --> 01:12:17.858
a shot at the title
for a long time.

1535
01:12:17.942 --> 01:12:19.651
- Now, listen, Tommy...
- And I've got a perfect record.

1536
01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:22.404
I'm 22 and 0.
Where's the money? Where?

1537
01:12:22.488 --> 01:12:24.448
Man, we haven't made
any serious money yet.

1538
01:12:24.532 --> 01:12:25.616
And we won't
without the man.

1539
01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.075
I ain't talking
about the money.

1540
01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.535
Look, the money is
gonna be there, but...

1541
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.287
I'm talking about
your rep, Tommy.

1542
01:12:30.371 --> 01:12:32.873
Look, don't sell out. Don't.
We don't need this guy.

1543
01:12:32.957 --> 01:12:35.918
Listen, Duke is a wonderful
man. Put the top up.

1544
01:12:36.002 --> 01:12:37.586
Hey, forget about
the top, would you?

1545
01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:39.296
I'm signing papers
with the man tomorrow.

1546
01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.006
No, listen to me, Tommy,
you sign them papers,

1547
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:42.132
you're like his property.

1548
01:12:42.216 --> 01:12:45.052
You see, you got no control. You
know, this is a dirty business.

1549
01:12:45.136 --> 01:12:47.554
It's full of these thieves
and gangsters, you know,

1550
01:12:47.639 --> 01:12:51.266
and they promise every good
young fighter who comes along...

1551
01:12:51.351 --> 01:12:55.270
They promise them the world,
and then they suck them dry.

1552
01:12:55.355 --> 01:12:56.855
And they leave them when
they ain't worth nothing.

1553
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.607
They leave them in the gutter, broke, Tommy!

1554
01:12:58.691 --> 01:13:00.275
That's the way
this business is run.

1555
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.778
Look, guys like Duke,
you know what he is?

1556
01:13:02.862 --> 01:13:04.738
He's a vampire.

1557
01:13:04.822 --> 01:13:06.615
He's living off
your blood, Tommy.

1558
01:13:06.699 --> 01:13:09.868
You know, the thing I'm trying
to do is what Mick done for me.

1559
01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:13.497
He tried to keep me away from
the dirty part of the business,

1560
01:13:13.581 --> 01:13:15.082
the way I'm trying to
do for you.

1561
01:13:15.166 --> 01:13:17.209
Man, I ain't you!
And you ain't Mick!

1562
01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.794
Man, when are you gonna
understand that?

1563
01:13:18.878 --> 01:13:20.587
When are you gonna understand
that this is a business?

1564
01:13:20.672 --> 01:13:21.672
In a business you need...

1565
01:13:21.756 --> 01:13:22.756
What, brains?

1566
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.132
You said that, not me.

1567
01:13:24.217 --> 01:13:25.884
Is that what you're saying?
You're saying I got no brains?

1568
01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:27.511
Look, Rocky, you took me
as far as you could.

1569
01:13:27.595 --> 01:13:29.304
But Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.

1570
01:13:29.389 --> 01:13:30.931
And if you wanna keep training me,
then do it.

1571
01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:32.140
But if you don't, don't!

1572
01:13:32.225 --> 01:13:33.850
But it's my way or
it's the highway!

1573
01:13:35.395 --> 01:13:36.603
Tommy!

1574
01:13:45.363 --> 01:13:47.990
Rocky,
put on your coat.

1575
01:13:48.074 --> 01:13:49.866
Just put on your coat.

1576
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:52.160
Come on.
It's not worth it.

1577
01:13:52.245 --> 01:13:54.663
Adrian, it is worth it.
He's just confused.

1578
01:13:54.747 --> 01:13:55.956
You don't see what's
happening under your eyes.

1579
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.666
Yeah, I do see!
What... Yeah, he's...

1580
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:59.918
He's twisted around by Duke.
I see what's happening.

1581
01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:02.796
No, come on, it's you, it's not
him. You can't live backwards.

1582
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.381
Come on, you can't
turn back the clocks.

1583
01:14:04.465 --> 01:14:05.590
We live now,
we live here.

1584
01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:06.967
Hey, Adrian,
I know where we live.

1585
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:08.301
What, do you think
I'm stupid?

1586
01:14:08.386 --> 01:14:10.721
I'm not as dumb
as you think I am!

1587
01:14:10.805 --> 01:14:13.098
Look, you don't think
I can smell it?

1588
01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.766
I see where we are.

1589
01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:16.518
Adrian, I don't want
this no more.

1590
01:14:16.602 --> 01:14:17.853
I want something
good for the family.

1591
01:14:17.937 --> 01:14:19.438
I don't want this.

1592
01:14:19.522 --> 01:14:20.897
I don't want this!

1593
01:14:20.982 --> 01:14:22.858
I mean, did I come
back here and get my

1594
01:14:22.942 --> 01:14:24.776
brains beat out for
these guys to say,

1595
01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:26.778
"Hey, there goes Balboa"?

1596
01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:29.281
I'm just another bum
in the neighborhood!

1597
01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:30.699
I didn't want this!

1598
01:14:30.783 --> 01:14:33.493
No, come on.
Nobody says that!

1599
01:14:33.578 --> 01:14:35.620
I'm saying it, Adrian.
I'm saying this.

1600
01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:36.872
I'm saying this.

1601
01:14:37.749 --> 01:14:39.708
When that kid was in the ring,
you know what I was doing?

1602
01:14:39.792 --> 01:14:40.834
I was winning.

1603
01:14:40.918 --> 01:14:42.044
When he was winning,
I was winning.

1604
01:14:42.128 --> 01:14:43.962
You were winning?
Yeah. It was...

1605
01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:45.756
It was like...
It was my last chance

1606
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.382
at getting some
respect for us.

1607
01:14:47.467 --> 01:14:49.217
Do you know that?
Come on, I respect you.

1608
01:14:49.302 --> 01:14:51.511
I respect you. Yes, I do. It's
gone! You can't respect me.

1609
01:14:51.596 --> 01:14:53.180
I don't respect myself.
No, you can't do it!

1610
01:14:53.264 --> 01:14:54.264
I do!
Don't tell me that.

1611
01:14:54.348 --> 01:14:56.725
All those beatings
you took in the ring.

1612
01:14:56.809 --> 01:14:58.435
I took them with you.

1613
01:14:58.978 --> 01:15:00.187
I know how you feel.

1614
01:15:00.271 --> 01:15:03.815
I know when somebody like Tommy
comes along, you feel alive.

1615
01:15:04.484 --> 01:15:06.902
But he's not you. He doesn't have your heart.

1616
01:15:06.986 --> 01:15:11.406
All those fighters you beat, you
beat 'em with heart, not muscle.

1617
01:15:11.491 --> 01:15:12.699
That's what Mickey knew.

1618
01:15:12.784 --> 01:15:14.951
That's why you and
Mickey were special.

1619
01:15:15.036 --> 01:15:16.703
But Mickey's dead!

1620
01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:20.999
If there's something you want to
pass on, pass it on to your son.

1621
01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:24.336
For God's sakes,
your son is lost.

1622
01:15:25.171 --> 01:15:26.463
He needs you!

1623
01:15:27.465 --> 01:15:30.217
I know Tommy
makes you feel great.

1624
01:15:30.301 --> 01:15:33.011
He makes you feel
like you're winning again.

1625
01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:35.514
But you're losing us!

1626
01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:37.974
Rocky, you're losing
your family!

1627
01:15:45.691 --> 01:15:47.025
I'm sorry.

1628
01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:50.278
You know it was
always you and me.

1629
01:15:50.363 --> 01:15:52.322
It was always you and me.

1630
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.368
I'm sorry, Adrian.

1631
01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:01.581
I don't know
about you guys,

1632
01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:04.209
but I gotta get
out of here.

1633
01:16:05.878 --> 01:16:07.796
Hey, what do you say
we go to the shore?

1634
01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.964
Yeah, let's go.

1635
01:16:09.048 --> 01:16:10.632
Yeah, great. How are we gonna get there?

1636
01:16:10.716 --> 01:16:12.008
What do you mean
how we gonna get there?

1637
01:16:12.093 --> 01:16:14.386
We throw our thumbs in
the air. We'll hitchhike.

1638
01:16:15.012 --> 01:16:16.138
Yo.

1639
01:16:16.222 --> 01:16:17.722
What's he want?

1640
01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.182
You want me to
stay with you?

1641
01:16:19.267 --> 01:16:20.308
No.

1642
01:16:20.393 --> 01:16:23.103
Yeah, right. I got enough
problems with my old man. Come on.

1643
01:16:25.231 --> 01:16:26.815
You ain't gonna
hit him, are you?

1644
01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:29.067
No, I ain't gonna
hit him. No.

1645
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.697
Yo, kid,
when you start smoking?

1646
01:16:33.781 --> 01:16:35.866
I don't know.
Didn't you ever smoke?

1647
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:38.285
Yeah, I done a lot of bad things, you know?

1648
01:16:39.787 --> 01:16:40.871
So?

1649
01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:45.542
So, I...
You know, I wised up.

1650
01:16:45.626 --> 01:16:48.545
Okay, so maybe I'll
wise up someday, too.

1651
01:16:50.631 --> 01:16:53.175
Maybe tonight's
a good night for

1652
01:16:53.259 --> 01:16:55.802
both of us to start
this wising-up thing.

1653
01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:57.762
Hey, don't worry about it.

1654
01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:59.222
I gotta worry about it.

1655
01:16:59.307 --> 01:17:01.808
I mean, the deal was we were
supposed to be tight, right?

1656
01:17:01.893 --> 01:17:04.144
What about Tommy?
You tight with him too, huh?

1657
01:17:06.314 --> 01:17:07.480
Tommy.

1658
01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:13.403
Yeah, well.

1659
01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:16.615
That was yesterday,
you know?

1660
01:17:20.912 --> 01:17:22.412
You know, kid,

1661
01:17:23.122 --> 01:17:25.248
you remember you were
telling me a long time ago

1662
01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:26.583
about deceptions,

1663
01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:29.169
and I was talking to you
about scams and...

1664
01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:32.130
I should have listened to
you. I was trying to teach you.

1665
01:17:32.924 --> 01:17:36.718
All right? But you, you were
teaching me and I didn't wise up.

1666
01:17:36.802 --> 01:17:40.805
And I didn't know, and I made
mistakes, and I do things, you know.

1667
01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.392
It bothers me, you know?

1668
01:17:44.477 --> 01:17:45.810
I forget a lot of things.

1669
01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:49.272
I... Just...

1670
01:17:51.484 --> 01:17:52.901
You know, I...

1671
01:17:59.825 --> 01:18:01.243
Hey, kid.

1672
01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:05.997
I know I made a few mistakes,
you know? It's...

1673
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.417
But I would love to
hang out with you again.

1674
01:18:09.877 --> 01:18:11.419
Just you and me.

1675
01:18:15.633 --> 01:18:19.844
I swear to God, it's just
gonna be you and me this time.

1676
01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:24.140
Home team?

1677
01:18:26.477 --> 01:18:29.187
Yeah, home team.

1678
01:18:32.358 --> 01:18:34.150
Hey, kid,
you wanna hear a joke?

1679
01:18:34.235 --> 01:18:35.652
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1680
01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:37.570
Knock, knock.

1681
01:18:37.655 --> 01:18:38.905
Who's there?

1682
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:40.198
Tuna fish.

1683
01:18:40.283 --> 01:18:41.950
Tuna fish who?

1684
01:18:42.034 --> 01:18:45.745
You can tune a piano,
but you cannot tune a fish.

1685
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:47.789
Well,
you're getting better.

1686
01:18:47.873 --> 01:18:49.874
Yeah,
that's a good one.

1687
01:18:56.173 --> 01:18:58.883
All right, folks. Lock
the door and hide the kids.

1688
01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:01.177
It's time to wage war!

1689
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:04.848
Tommy Gunn has been said

1690
01:19:04.932 --> 01:19:07.058
to be such a student
of Rocky Balboa's style,

1691
01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:09.644
he's been nicknamed by
the press the Clone Ranger.

1692
01:19:09.729 --> 01:19:11.521
In the red corner...

1693
01:19:11.605 --> 01:19:14.065
Relax, Rocko. He ain't worth the stress.

1694
01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.985
It ain't him, Paulie.
It ain't him.

1695
01:19:17.069 --> 01:19:18.069
Turbo-charged.

1696
01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:21.906
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

1697
01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:23.241
Tommy Gunn.

1698
01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:30.123
Boy, looks like
the fans are unhappy with Tommy Gunn

1699
01:19:30.207 --> 01:19:32.042
for leaving
Rocky Balboa behind.

1700
01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:35.795
Yeah, of course. He's
nobody's sweetheart, that kid.

1701
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.966
Weighing in at 242
very impressive pounds,

1702
01:19:40.384 --> 01:19:46.765
the present world heavyweight
champion, Union Cane!

1703
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.726
Looks like he's in great
shape, don't he, Paulie?

1704
01:19:49.810 --> 01:19:50.852
Yeah.

1705
01:19:50.936 --> 01:19:52.604
And the
referee, Capaccito, calling

1706
01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:54.314
both fighters to
the center of the ring.

1707
01:19:54.398 --> 01:19:56.524
Whoa, Tommy, you're
looking... He's a little tight.

1708
01:19:56.609 --> 01:19:58.568
He's nervous, you know?

1709
01:19:58.652 --> 01:20:01.529
Like the way I felt when I was
fighting with Apollo, you know?

1710
01:20:01.614 --> 01:20:04.032
Rocko, he ain't you.
Hardly ever was, that kid.

1711
01:20:04.116 --> 01:20:05.658
Hey, come on. Give him a break, would you?

1712
01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.293
All right, come on, Tommy.
Do what you was told.

1713
01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:17.670
In and out, side to side.
Don't eat the jab.

1714
01:20:21.133 --> 01:20:22.675
Get off the ropes!
What are you, blind?

1715
01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:26.846
Well, he's getting hit with
everything but the ring posts.

1716
01:20:26.931 --> 01:20:28.681
Come on, Cane. Let's rumble. Go for it, Cane.

1717
01:20:28.766 --> 01:20:32.185
Come on, Tommy, what's
the matter with you? That's it!

1718
01:20:37.817 --> 01:20:38.942
That's it!

1719
01:20:39.819 --> 01:20:42.362
Slip the jab, move.
Move that, side to side.

1720
01:20:42.446 --> 01:20:43.780
Back and forth,
like a metronome.

1721
01:20:43.864 --> 01:20:45.407
Slip, slide, glide.

1722
01:20:45.491 --> 01:20:46.866
That's it!

1723
01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.205
Jab!

1724
01:21:00.214 --> 01:21:02.841
You see what...
He remembers everything.

1725
01:21:03.717 --> 01:21:05.051
All right.
Come on, Tommy.

1726
01:21:05.136 --> 01:21:06.636
I'm in there, man.
Do what I'm doing.

1727
01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.556
Do what I'm doing. Back and
forth, side to side, that's it!

1728
01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.020
Come on! Come on!

1729
01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:18.273
Come on, kid! Don't let
him up! Don't let him up!

1730
01:21:18.357 --> 01:21:20.150
Roll, roll, roll!

1731
01:21:25.197 --> 01:21:26.531
Dig, dig!

1732
01:21:37.001 --> 01:21:38.710
Got him! He's down!
The heavyweight champion

1733
01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:40.086
Union Cane is down!

1734
01:21:42.923 --> 01:21:46.050
One, two, three,

1735
01:21:46.135 --> 01:21:47.218
four.

1736
01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:48.428
Five.

1737
01:21:48.512 --> 01:21:50.847
Six, seven.
What are you doing?

1738
01:21:50.931 --> 01:21:51.973
Eight.

1739
01:21:52.057 --> 01:21:53.057
Nine!

1740
01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:54.809
Ten! You're out!

1741
01:21:54.894 --> 01:21:55.977
Yeah!

1742
01:21:56.061 --> 01:21:57.562
Yo! Yo!

1743
01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:59.647
The heavyweight champion,
Tommy...

1744
01:22:01.734 --> 01:22:02.775
Yeah!

1745
01:22:04.236 --> 01:22:07.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
by way of a knockout,

1746
01:22:07.364 --> 01:22:12.744
we have a new champion,
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.

1747
01:22:16.749 --> 01:22:19.501
Congratulations.
A sensational upset victory.

1748
01:22:19.585 --> 01:22:22.170
And you're now the champion
of the world. How do you feel?

1749
01:22:22.254 --> 01:22:23.630
Never better.
I mean, I don't know

1750
01:22:23.714 --> 01:22:25.048
what's wrong with
these people, but...

1751
01:22:25.132 --> 01:22:29.177
Because you're not a champion.
You're a crumb bug dirtbag.

1752
01:22:29.261 --> 01:22:30.428
Hey, come on,
Paul, give him a break.

1753
01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:33.723
He did something wonderful.

1754
01:22:33.807 --> 01:22:36.351
Long live the king!
Yes!

1755
01:22:36.435 --> 01:22:37.519
I'd like to say thank you.

1756
01:22:37.603 --> 01:22:40.355
I'd like to thank the
man that made this happen,

1757
01:22:40.439 --> 01:22:42.190
and I'd like to thank the
man who made me believe

1758
01:22:42.274 --> 01:22:43.691
that all this
could happen,

1759
01:22:43.776 --> 01:22:46.027
the man who's been like
an angel on my shoulder,

1760
01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:47.654
Mr. George Washington Duke!

1761
01:22:47.738 --> 01:22:48.780
Yeah!

1762
01:22:50.616 --> 01:22:51.908
And there you have it.

1763
01:22:51.992 --> 01:22:55.787
A new champion of the world,
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.

1764
01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:58.540
Boy, I'll tell you, a big
surprise, at least to me,

1765
01:22:58.624 --> 01:23:00.667
that the new champion
thanked Duke

1766
01:23:00.751 --> 01:23:02.001
instead of the guy
that got him here.

1767
01:23:02.086 --> 01:23:03.044
Yeah.

1768
01:23:03.128 --> 01:23:04.379
This crowd is unhappy.

1769
01:23:04.463 --> 01:23:09.342
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1770
01:23:09.426 --> 01:23:11.261
Rocko, too much TV
is bad for the eyes.

1771
01:23:11.345 --> 01:23:12.929
No, my eyes are okay,
Paulie. Sit.

1772
01:23:13.931 --> 01:23:15.890
Well, too much TV
is bad for my ears.

1773
01:23:15.975 --> 01:23:17.100
Yeah.

1774
01:23:17.685 --> 01:23:19.686
Hey, hi, slugger.
Good fight, huh?

1775
01:23:19.812 --> 01:23:21.104
It's okay, dad.

1776
01:23:21.188 --> 01:23:23.606
You're the real champ around
here. I made this for you.

1777
01:23:23.691 --> 01:23:25.024
Yeah?

1778
01:23:26.068 --> 01:23:27.402
Beautiful.

1779
01:23:28.654 --> 01:23:31.239
Rocko, let's put our teeth
around a few brews, okay?

1780
01:23:31.323 --> 01:23:32.532
I could use the company.

1781
01:23:32.616 --> 01:23:33.992
Sure.
Yeah, good idea.

1782
01:23:36.036 --> 01:23:37.745
Think I should go out
with your uncle Paulie?

1783
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:38.955
If I can watch TV.

1784
01:23:39.039 --> 01:23:41.541
Yeah, hey, okay,
listen.

1785
01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:43.084
Yeah, you can
watch TV, okay?

1786
01:23:43.168 --> 01:23:44.419
But don't stay up too late.

1787
01:23:44.503 --> 01:23:45.837
You gotta get
them bones growing.

1788
01:23:45.921 --> 01:23:47.672
All right.
Okay.

1789
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.217
Wow, what a fight.
That was something.

1790
01:23:51.302 --> 01:23:52.760
Yeah, something.

1791
01:23:52.845 --> 01:23:53.928
Jeez.

1792
01:23:54.013 --> 01:23:55.430
I told you you could
give him everything

1793
01:23:55.514 --> 01:23:57.890
but you can't
give him your heart.

1794
01:23:57.975 --> 01:24:00.143
It's okay, Adrian,
really.

1795
01:24:00.227 --> 01:24:01.227
Yeah?

1796
01:24:01.312 --> 01:24:02.770
Yeah, it's all right.

1797
01:24:04.064 --> 01:24:08.109
It's... Hey, kid, don't
you stay up too late, okay?

1798
01:24:09.361 --> 01:24:10.695
That was some fight.

1799
01:24:12.323 --> 01:24:13.865
Are you okay?

1800
01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:15.199
Sure.

1801
01:24:17.119 --> 01:24:18.870
I won't be out too late.
Okay.

1802
01:24:19.997 --> 01:24:21.289
See you, champ.

1803
01:24:21.373 --> 01:24:24.208
Yeah, yeah. Have a good
time with Uncle Paulie.

1804
01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:25.710
Yeah, sure.

1805
01:24:31.884 --> 01:24:33.843
Ladies and gentlemen, let
me present to you the newest,

1806
01:24:33.927 --> 01:24:36.304
the youngest heavyweight
champion of all time,

1807
01:24:36.388 --> 01:24:38.598
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

1808
01:24:38.682 --> 01:24:40.224
Yeah!

1809
01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:41.976
Do you think
the fight was too easy?

1810
01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:43.895
He hit me a few good shots.
But I was never hurt.

1811
01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:46.105
I mean, I'm just glad
to be the champ. Yeah!

1812
01:24:46.190 --> 01:24:48.024
Tommy, don't you think
that this looked more like

1813
01:24:48.108 --> 01:24:49.817
a Philadelphia
sparring session at times

1814
01:24:49.902 --> 01:24:51.611
instead of
a championship match?

1815
01:24:51.695 --> 01:24:52.945
It didn't look like
you broke a sweat.

1816
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:54.489
Yeah,
you're very observant.

1817
01:24:54.573 --> 01:24:56.616
Union Cane wasn't
feeling that good.

1818
01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.035
But Tommy Gunn would have done the same thing

1819
01:24:59.119 --> 01:25:01.371
if Union was 100%.
Next.

1820
01:25:01.455 --> 01:25:04.832
100%? He fought like he didn't
have a heartbeat. Come on!

1821
01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.876
Everybody knows that Cane
is just a paper champion.

1822
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.336
What does he mean
by "paper champion"?

1823
01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.421
It means Cane's title
was manufactured.

1824
01:25:10.506 --> 01:25:11.673
He never won it from Balboa.

1825
01:25:11.757 --> 01:25:13.966
Gentlemen, give the boy a
break. Union Cane is for real.

1826
01:25:14.051 --> 01:25:15.426
Tommy, you ever think
you're gonna get out

1827
01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:17.011
from underneath
Rocky Balboa's shadow?

1828
01:25:17.096 --> 01:25:18.888
Man, I won the title.
What more do I have to do?

1829
01:25:18.972 --> 01:25:20.473
I'll tell you
what you have to do,

1830
01:25:20.557 --> 01:25:22.475
you've gotta fight some
real opponents, right?

1831
01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:25.019
Balboa fought them all.
But I beat the best tonight.

1832
01:25:25.104 --> 01:25:26.688
The best? The best?
This guy's a bum.

1833
01:25:26.772 --> 01:25:28.564
He doesn't even deserve
a shot at the title.

1834
01:25:28.649 --> 01:25:30.149
Gentlemen,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1835
01:25:30.234 --> 01:25:31.317
We're getting carried away.

1836
01:25:31.402 --> 01:25:34.112
Now, Union Cane was the
recognized champ. Next question.

1837
01:25:34.196 --> 01:25:36.781
We know the rating system
can be manipulated.

1838
01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:39.701
The bottom line is Tommy Gunn
beat a second-rate fighter

1839
01:25:39.785 --> 01:25:42.203
with so much glass in his jaw,
he ought to be a chandelier.

1840
01:25:42.287 --> 01:25:43.371
Say what you want,

1841
01:25:43.455 --> 01:25:46.082
but this man will prove
to be a great champion.

1842
01:25:46.166 --> 01:25:49.293
He might win a few fights, but
a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.

1843
01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:50.753
No, no, no.

1844
01:25:50.838 --> 01:25:52.505
He's no Rocky Balboa.
Let's face it.

1845
01:25:52.589 --> 01:25:53.715
There is only one Balboa.

1846
01:25:53.799 --> 01:25:55.967
Now, Balboa was
a true people's champion.

1847
01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:57.760
But in time,
Tommy Gunn may be

1848
01:25:57.845 --> 01:25:59.887
able to fill his shoes.
Next question.

1849
01:25:59.972 --> 01:26:02.515
Not by fighting
stiffs like Cane, he won't.

1850
01:26:02.599 --> 01:26:04.225
Man, I'll fight anybody anywhere!

1851
01:26:04.309 --> 01:26:07.061
Who? When? When are you
gonna fight a real fighter?

1852
01:26:07.146 --> 01:26:08.771
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
gentlemen, come on.

1853
01:26:08.856 --> 01:26:11.733
We want to thank you for coming
tonight, and we'll look forward...

1854
01:26:11.817 --> 01:26:13.985
Hey, Tommy,
I got something for you.

1855
01:26:14.069 --> 01:26:16.571
For your next fight, why don't you
fight the redhead in the front row?

1856
01:26:16.697 --> 01:26:18.156
I hear she comes
real cheap.

1857
01:26:19.825 --> 01:26:23.494
We look forward to seeing you
at Tommy Gunn's next fight.

1858
01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:26.080
Why the hell did you say
Balboa was better, man?

1859
01:26:26.165 --> 01:26:27.540
Do you believe he's better?
Of course not.

1860
01:26:27.624 --> 01:26:28.833
But we can't
talk in here, huh?

1861
01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.084
You the champ.
You the champ.

1862
01:26:30.169 --> 01:26:32.003
Who are you gonna
fight for the next fight, Tommy?

1863
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.672
Man, what the hell
happened in there?

1864
01:26:34.757 --> 01:26:37.175
I won the damn title, and
these people think I'm a bum!

1865
01:26:37.259 --> 01:26:38.926
Man, why didn't you
take up for me in there?

1866
01:26:39.011 --> 01:26:40.595
Listen to me, when the press
is right, they're right.

1867
01:26:40.679 --> 01:26:42.346
Right? Man, I'm as good
as Balboa ever was.

1868
01:26:42.431 --> 01:26:43.598
I don't give a damn
about what they say.

1869
01:26:43.682 --> 01:26:45.224
And I'm tired of being
called a damn robot, too!

1870
01:26:45.309 --> 01:26:46.893
Listen to me, Tommy Gunn.
You can't fight the press.

1871
01:26:46.977 --> 01:26:47.977
I can't fight the press.

1872
01:26:48.061 --> 01:26:49.103
Oh, God!

1873
01:26:49.188 --> 01:26:52.148
As long as they got Balboa on
the brain, he'll always be champ.

1874
01:26:52.232 --> 01:26:53.274
The man fought
wars in the ring.

1875
01:26:53.358 --> 01:26:54.317
Tommy, face facts.

1876
01:26:54.401 --> 01:26:56.068
You're in his shadow. I don't
know if there's any way out.

1877
01:26:56.153 --> 01:26:57.153
This is your own man talking!

1878
01:26:57.237 --> 01:26:58.404
No, no, no!
Listen to me.

1879
01:26:58.489 --> 01:27:00.406
There's a way for you to
get the respect you deserve,

1880
01:27:00.491 --> 01:27:03.534
but what you've got to do is
challenge Balboa to fight man-to-man.

1881
01:27:03.619 --> 01:27:05.161
That's right. George here
could set this fight up abroad

1882
01:27:05.245 --> 01:27:06.579
in a matter of weeks.

1883
01:27:06.663 --> 01:27:08.080
Yeah, it'd be the greatest fight ever.

1884
01:27:08.165 --> 01:27:09.373
Teacher against student.

1885
01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:11.417
Old lion against young lion.

1886
01:27:11.502 --> 01:27:13.336
And it's the only way you're
ever gonna get peace of mind,

1887
01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.629
'cause believe me
when I tell you

1888
01:27:14.713 --> 01:27:16.923
that press is gonna hound you
with that man's legend

1889
01:27:17.007 --> 01:27:19.217
for as long as you dare
to wear boxing gloves.

1890
01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:21.511
You've got to get him
into that ring, Tommy Gunn,

1891
01:27:21.595 --> 01:27:23.304
or you're gonna be hearing
questions like you heard tonight

1892
01:27:23.388 --> 01:27:24.472
for the rest of your life.

1893
01:27:24.556 --> 01:27:26.974
Then you're gonna start to ask
yourself, "Could I really take him?

1894
01:27:27.059 --> 01:27:28.309
"Am I really good enough?

1895
01:27:28.393 --> 01:27:30.478
"Do people really think
I'm a cheap carbon copy

1896
01:27:30.562 --> 01:27:32.146
"or a second-rate
pretender who only

1897
01:27:32.231 --> 01:27:34.941
"got a shot
because of my skin tone?"

1898
01:27:35.317 --> 01:27:37.693
You've got to challenge that
man to fight, Tommy Gunn.

1899
01:27:37.778 --> 01:27:40.154
And if he refuses,
then you gotta insult him!

1900
01:27:40.239 --> 01:27:42.698
You gotta dog him.
You gotta humiliate him.

1901
01:27:42.783 --> 01:27:44.951
You gotta do whatever you got
to do to get him into that ring,

1902
01:27:45.035 --> 01:27:46.869
but that's what
you got to do.

1903
01:27:52.334 --> 01:27:55.419
Okay, blast off.
Rolling silver.

1904
01:27:55.504 --> 01:27:58.840
And down. Yo, Andy! Andy,
flippers ain't flipping. Yo, Andy.

1905
01:27:58.924 --> 01:28:00.633
Hey, that machine
cost me a fortune.

1906
01:28:00.717 --> 01:28:03.344
Yeah, well, it's costing me
a fortune, too, you know?

1907
01:28:03.428 --> 01:28:05.346
Rocky Balboa.

1908
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:06.389
What the hell
was that?

1909
01:28:06.473 --> 01:28:09.851
Rocky Balboa, there's a man out
here wishing to speak with you.

1910
01:28:09.935 --> 01:28:11.602
Rocky Balboa!

1911
01:28:13.981 --> 01:28:15.523
Rocko, you know who that is?

1912
01:28:15.607 --> 01:28:16.732
Ain't that the Duke?

1913
01:28:16.817 --> 01:28:18.192
Yeah, I know who that is.

1914
01:28:20.863 --> 01:28:22.530
Rocky, you need
some help?

1915
01:28:22.614 --> 01:28:25.366
No, guys, it ain't
no pie-eating contest.

1916
01:28:28.996 --> 01:28:30.663
Look what's
in the street.

1917
01:28:31.206 --> 01:28:32.748
Yo, Tommy,
what are you doing here?

1918
01:28:32.833 --> 01:28:34.709
You ought to be out there
celebrating, right?

1919
01:28:34.793 --> 01:28:36.127
No, I'm challenging you
to a fight.

1920
01:28:36.211 --> 01:28:38.337
Anytime, anyplace,
anywhere.

1921
01:28:38.422 --> 01:28:40.256
- Fight?
- That's right.

1922
01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:42.842
You're coming down here
with these people,

1923
01:28:42.926 --> 01:28:43.926
asking me if I wanna

1924
01:28:44.011 --> 01:28:45.720
throw hands with you?
Is that what this is about?

1925
01:28:45.804 --> 01:28:46.804
Yeah,
that's what it's about.

1926
01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:49.432
And I ain't nobody's robot! Nobody's boy!

1927
01:28:49.516 --> 01:28:51.517
Now, are you accepting the
challenge, or are you yellow?

1928
01:28:53.103 --> 01:28:54.896
He has no class.
Come on, Rock.

1929
01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.356
Hey. He has no class. Come on.

1930
01:28:58.358 --> 01:29:00.026
Let's go inside.
Come on.

1931
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.410
You know, Paulie,
it ain't him, you know?

1932
01:29:09.494 --> 01:29:10.661
You wanna shoot some
eight-ball or something?

1933
01:29:10.746 --> 01:29:13.873
Hey! Man, I ain't through
talking with you yet.

1934
01:29:13.957 --> 01:29:16.751
Hey, look, Tommy, I ain't got
no more to say to you, okay?

1935
01:29:16.835 --> 01:29:18.461
Look, I just wanted good
things for you, all right?

1936
01:29:18.545 --> 01:29:20.421
Hell you did. Man, you were
only in this for the money.

1937
01:29:20.505 --> 01:29:21.505
Money?

1938
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:22.590
Yeah, I'm tired of walking
around in your shadow, man,

1939
01:29:22.674 --> 01:29:23.799
people calling me
your robot.

1940
01:29:23.884 --> 01:29:26.260
You thought I was in this
for the money, Tommy?

1941
01:29:26.345 --> 01:29:28.763
You know, we were supposed
to be like brothers, you know?

1942
01:29:28.847 --> 01:29:29.972
You don't remember that?

1943
01:29:30.057 --> 01:29:32.642
You don't know this, but you
got a deception going here.

1944
01:29:32.726 --> 01:29:35.269
This guy here. He was using you for the bait.

1945
01:29:35.354 --> 01:29:37.104
He wants to get you
and me in the ring.

1946
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:39.148
That's what he wants, us to
fight each other, you know?

1947
01:29:39.232 --> 01:29:40.483
To make the money, right?

1948
01:29:40.567 --> 01:29:42.068
He don't care
about you, Tommy.

1949
01:29:42.152 --> 01:29:44.028
He don't care about me
neither, right?

1950
01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:46.656
Come on, come on. Enough of
the fantasy. Let's talk reality.

1951
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:50.534
Rocky Balboa, are you prepared
to accept Tommy Gunn's challenge?

1952
01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:51.953
- Tommy.
- All right.

1953
01:29:52.037 --> 01:29:53.162
Hey!

1954
01:29:53.205 --> 01:29:55.247
Hey, man, I would've taken you
any time. Come on. Let's go.

1955
01:29:55.332 --> 01:29:57.124
Hey, Tommy, you're a piece
of garbage, you know that?

1956
01:29:57.209 --> 01:29:58.626
This ain't
none of your business!

1957
01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:00.294
Ain't none of my business?
Hey, come on, Paulie.

1958
01:30:00.379 --> 01:30:01.504
Ain't none of my business?

1959
01:30:01.588 --> 01:30:03.547
Paulie, forget about it.
The man spit blood for you,

1960
01:30:03.632 --> 01:30:05.257
put you ahead of
his own family,

1961
01:30:05.342 --> 01:30:09.220
and you bring these rat bums
around here and kill his dignity?

1962
01:30:09.304 --> 01:30:11.806
Rocko made you your shot, you
know that? He's the real champ.

1963
01:30:11.890 --> 01:30:13.474
You're just a goddamn joke.

1964
01:30:13.558 --> 01:30:15.101
Now, just get out of here
before I break your face.

1965
01:30:15.185 --> 01:30:17.103
Tommy! Tommy,
come on!

1966
01:30:17.813 --> 01:30:19.063
Paulie!

1967
01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:21.190
What?

1968
01:30:21.274 --> 01:30:23.109
Break your hand on this bum,
and what are you worth then?

1969
01:30:23.193 --> 01:30:24.777
Paulie, are you okay?

1970
01:30:24.861 --> 01:30:26.904
You should have left him on
the street where you found him.

1971
01:30:26.989 --> 01:30:27.989
Get off me, man!

1972
01:30:28.073 --> 01:30:29.323
Right.
Get him out of here.

1973
01:30:29.408 --> 01:30:30.533
Merlin, Merlin,
get him out of here!

1974
01:30:30.617 --> 01:30:31.659
Merlin!

1975
01:30:31.743 --> 01:30:32.785
- Get off me!
- Get him out of here!

1976
01:30:32.869 --> 01:30:34.412
- Get him out of here! Merlin!
- Tommy!

1977
01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:35.913
Get off me!

1978
01:30:36.915 --> 01:30:40.001
Now you knocked him down. Why
don't you try knocking me down now?

1979
01:30:40.085 --> 01:30:41.502
No, no, in the ring,
in the ring.

1980
01:30:41.586 --> 01:30:43.212
Tommy Gunn only
fights in the ring.

1981
01:30:43.296 --> 01:30:44.422
Come on,
let's get out of here.

1982
01:30:44.506 --> 01:30:45.673
My ring's outside.

1983
01:30:45.757 --> 01:30:48.676
Yeah? Let's do it.
Come on!

1984
01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:49.844
Tommy! Tommy!

1985
01:30:49.928 --> 01:30:51.595
Let's go live!
Go live!

1986
01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.931
Come on, Rocky. Kill
this here punk. He's nothing.

1987
01:30:54.016 --> 01:30:56.017
Tear him down.
You gotta take him down.

1988
01:30:56.643 --> 01:30:57.977
Just take him right down.

1989
01:30:58.061 --> 01:30:59.687
He's a bum, Rocky, I'm telling you.

1990
01:30:59.771 --> 01:31:00.938
Balboa is
a street fighter.

1991
01:31:01.023 --> 01:31:02.148
You a prize fighter.

1992
01:31:02.232 --> 01:31:04.025
Don't be a damn fool!
Hey, you don't own me!

1993
01:31:04.109 --> 01:31:05.776
Take it easy, Tommy!
You don't own me!

1994
01:31:05.861 --> 01:31:07.528
What the hell is wrong with you?
Take it easy!

1995
01:31:07.612 --> 01:31:09.155
Nobody does.

1996
01:31:09.239 --> 01:31:10.531
I want my respect.
Tommy.

1997
01:31:10.615 --> 01:31:12.908
Well, come and get it.
Come on, Tommy.

1998
01:31:13.577 --> 01:31:14.910
Come on, Rocky.

1999
01:31:24.796 --> 01:31:27.548
I loved you, man.
Do you know that?

2000
01:31:27.632 --> 01:31:31.218
You and me were supposed
to be like this, Tommy.

2001
01:31:31.636 --> 01:31:33.095
You blew it!

2002
01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:34.305
You...

2003
01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.311
You're always champ, Rocky.

2004
01:31:43.398 --> 01:31:45.816
Lucky punch. Lucky punch!
But he's a street fighter.

2005
01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:48.110
And I told you never to fight
a street-fighting fight.

2006
01:31:48.195 --> 01:31:49.945
Come on, let's get out
of here. Come on, come on.

2007
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:51.614
You're always the champ,
Rocky. Great.

2008
01:31:52.407 --> 01:31:54.909
Hey! Rock, watch out!

2009
01:32:03.752 --> 01:32:04.752
Somebody...

2010
01:32:06.046 --> 01:32:09.090
Rocky! Come on,
Rock! Rocky, come on!

2011
01:32:09.174 --> 01:32:11.467
Get out of it, Rocky!
Come on!

2012
01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.844
Get him, Rocky!

2013
01:32:16.807 --> 01:32:18.516
Come on, Rocky!

2014
01:32:22.145 --> 01:32:23.979
Rocky, get out of it!

2015
01:32:24.564 --> 01:32:25.856
I got it!

2016
01:32:25.941 --> 01:32:27.608
Rocky!
Come on, Rocky!

2017
01:32:27.692 --> 01:32:29.443
Rock! Get up, Rocky!

2018
01:32:29.528 --> 01:32:31.612
This is great stuff!
This is beautiful!

2019
01:32:31.988 --> 01:32:34.657
Mom! Mom! It's Dad.

2020
01:32:34.741 --> 01:32:35.991
He's on television.
He's fighting.

2021
01:32:36.076 --> 01:32:37.201
What?

2022
01:32:38.203 --> 01:32:41.497
Come on, man! Come on!
Ready to fight me? Come on!

2023

2024
01:32:45.585 --> 01:32:47.128
Come on!

2025
01:32:47.212 --> 01:32:48.671
Get out of it, Rocky!
Get him, Rock!

2026
01:32:52.175 --> 01:32:54.218

2029
01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:07.148
Rocky,

01:33:07.232 --> 01:33:08.315
Come on! Get up!

2031
01:33:14.781 --> 01:33:16.407
Come on.
What's the matter, Rock?

2032
01:33:22.164 --> 01:33:23.372
Rocky!

2033
01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:26.876
You're out!

2034
01:33:29.254 --> 01:33:31.213
And if he dies, he dies.

2035
01:33:31.673 --> 01:33:34.258
You're the champ!
Now get up! One more round.

2036
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:37.136
Come on, Balboa!

2037
01:33:38.096 --> 01:33:40.556
Get up! Don't lay down! Fight this guy hard!

2038
01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.433
Come on! Come on!

2039
01:33:42.976 --> 01:33:45.144
He's no machine.
I didn't hear no bell!

2040
01:33:45.228 --> 01:33:49.064
Get up, you son of a bitch,

I didn't hear no bell.

2044
01:34:08.084 --> 01:34:10.085
Tommy. One more round.

2045
01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:12.338
Tommy, come on. Get back. Get back, boy!

2046
01:34:12.422 --> 01:34:13.631
Tommy,
you don't need this.

2047
01:34:13.715 --> 01:34:15.299
Tommy, you lose,
you're finished!

2048
01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:17.051
I got one more round.
Come on!

2049
01:34:17.969 --> 01:34:19.637
I'm not gonna knock
you out this time.

2050
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:22.223
I'm gonna put you
through the street.

2051
01:34:22.307 --> 01:34:23.432
One more round.

2052
01:34:24.142 --> 01:34:26.810
Come on, Rocky!
Come on, Rock!

2053
01:34:35.654 --> 01:34:36.987
Come on, Tommy.

2054
01:34:42.661 --> 01:34:43.994

Come on, Tommy!
Come on! Come on!

Touch me and I'll sue.

2058
01:35:17.404 --> 01:35:18.862
All right, Rocky.
You've done it.

2059
01:35:20.865 --> 01:35:22.449
What in
the hell are you doing?

2060
01:35:22.534 --> 01:35:24.368
Get up! What in the hell?

2061
01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:28.539
Rocko!
Let's get home.

2062
01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.961
That's it, Rocky!

2063
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.186
Come on, knock the bum out!
He took my room!

2064
01:35:51.271 --> 01:35:52.938
Your right.
Throw your right!

2065
01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:57.568
Jab, jab, come on!

2066
01:35:59.696 --> 01:36:02.197
You're losing everything!
Come on!

2067
01:36:04.075 --> 01:36:05.534
Come on, Dad!
You can beat him!

2068
01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:11.915
Fight back, you bum!
Fight back!

2069
01:36:20.258 --> 01:36:21.425
Stop!

2070
01:36:22.927 --> 01:36:24.136
Rocky!

2071
01:36:25.096 --> 01:36:26.930
Come on, get that...

2072
01:36:27.432 --> 01:36:29.183
Come on, Dad!
Go for it!

2073
01:36:32.395 --> 01:36:34.855
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2074
01:36:34.939 --> 01:36:36.607

2075
01:36:46.743 --> 01:36:48.160
Hit him, Dad, come on!

2076
01:36:49.829 --> 01:36:52.623
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2077
01:36:55.794 --> 01:36:57.127
Go for it!

2078
01:37:11.184 --> 01:37:12.184
Dad!

2079
01:37:12.852 --> 01:37:16.397
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2080
01:37:17.649 --> 01:37:20.484
Hey, Adrian, you were right.
You were right.

2081
01:37:24.739 --> 01:37:26.490
God damn.

2082
01:37:28.868 --> 01:37:30.285
Only in America.

2083
01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.045
Hey, Rock, you outclassed the bum, huh?

2084
01:37:43.508 --> 01:37:45.926
Yeah. Yeah.

2085
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:47.845
Rocky, come on.
Don't.

2086
01:37:47.929 --> 01:37:49.012
Duke.

2087
01:37:50.682 --> 01:37:52.349
Touch me and I'll sue.

2088
01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:55.936
Come on, punk.

2089
01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:58.147
Touch me and I'll sue.

2090
01:38:07.866 --> 01:38:09.366
Sue me for what?

2091
01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.205
Rocky! Rocky!

2092
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:19.084
Hey, yo, father.

2093
01:38:21.045 --> 01:38:22.796
I love it
when he does that.

2094
01:38:24.048 --> 01:38:27.759
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2095
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.316
Come on, Dad.
We're gonna be late.

2096
01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.902
Come on, Speedy Gonzales! Come on!

2097
01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:50.616
Come on, Dad. You can do better than that.

2098
01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.825
No way.

2099
01:38:53.036 --> 01:38:54.495
I don't know.
It's like these steps

2100
01:38:54.579 --> 01:38:56.371
keep growing
taller every year.

2101
01:38:56.456 --> 01:38:57.915
My goodness!

2102
01:38:59.501 --> 01:39:00.834
Look at this thing, kid.

2103
01:39:00.919 --> 01:39:02.419
As long as this
thing is here,

2104
01:39:02.504 --> 01:39:05.172
pigeons is always gonna
have a place to sit, right?

2105
01:39:05.256 --> 01:39:06.548
I can't believe it,
you know?

2106
01:39:06.633 --> 01:39:08.800
And this is where it
all started for me, kid.

2107
01:39:08.885 --> 01:39:10.552
Running up and down
these steps, you know?

2108
01:39:10.637 --> 01:39:11.720
Dad.

2109
01:39:11.804 --> 01:39:13.639
Yeah?
Dad, we're gonna be late.

2110
01:39:13.723 --> 01:39:15.182
Yeah, okay.

2111
01:39:15.266 --> 01:39:17.351
Hey, wait a minute.
What's wrong with your ear?

2112
01:39:17.435 --> 01:39:18.519
What's wrong with it?

2113
01:39:18.603 --> 01:39:21.522
You got something growing in
your ear. You got like a bump.

2114
01:39:21.606 --> 01:39:23.690
What bump?

2115
01:39:23.775 --> 01:39:25.067
This bump.

2116
01:39:29.113 --> 01:39:30.531
Thanks, Dad.

2117
01:39:30.615 --> 01:39:32.032
Hey, you deserve it.

2118
01:39:32.116 --> 01:39:33.784
Thank you for being born.

2119
01:39:34.619 --> 01:39:36.411
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2120
01:39:37.288 --> 01:39:39.498
What do you think?
The new me?

2121
01:39:40.083 --> 01:39:41.708
Well,

2122
01:39:41.793 --> 01:39:43.919
you look like the daughter
that I always wanted.

2123
01:39:44.003 --> 01:39:46.046
What are you talking about?
Yo, yo.

2124
01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:49.216
Hey, now, don't punch me.
I'm getting brittle as it is.

2125
01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.676
Look at this, you know.

2126
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.595
I've been running up and
down these steps for 20 years,

2127
01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.681
and I never knew
there was valuable pictures

2128
01:39:55.765 --> 01:39:57.057
in this building,
you know?

2129
01:39:57.141 --> 01:39:58.725
Well, you're never too
old to learn something new.

2130
01:39:58.810 --> 01:39:59.851
Yeah.

2131
01:39:59.936 --> 01:40:01.562
You're gonna love Picasso.
Yeah?

2132
01:40:01.646 --> 01:40:04.189
Yeah, well,
I love almost everybody.
