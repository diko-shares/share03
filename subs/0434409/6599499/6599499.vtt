00:00:42.878 --> 00:00:45.380
<i>Remember, remember
The 5th of November</i>

2
00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:48.133
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

3
00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:50.635
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

4
00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.679
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

5
00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:57.684
<i>But what of the man?</i>

6
00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:01.229
<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes</i>

7
00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:05.400
<i>and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

8
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.695
<i>But who was he really?</i>

9
00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:10.280
<i>What was he like?</i>

10
00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:20.624
<i>We are told to remember
the idea and not the man.</i>

11
00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:22.334
<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

12
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.505
<i>He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

13
00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.758
<i>But 400 years later</i>

14
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:32.636
<i>an idea can still change the world.</i>

15
00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:37.182
<i>I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.</i>

16
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.101
<i>I've seen people kill
in the name of them...</i>

17
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.647
<i>...and die defending them.</i>

18
00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:47.901
<i>But you cannot kiss an idea</i>

19
00:01:48.318 --> 00:01:51.279
<i>cannot touch it or hold it.</i>

20
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.076
<i>Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.</i>

21
00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.328
<i>They do not love.</i>

22
00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.750
<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

23
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.877
<i>It is a man.</i>

24
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:09.589
<i>A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.</i>

25
00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:11.800
<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

26
00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:30.235
<i>So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies</i>

27
00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:35.448
<i>that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

28
00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:39.035
<i>A gesture, they said, of goodwill.</i>

29
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.079
<i>You wanna know what I think?</i>

30
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.916
<i>Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.</i>

31
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.461
<i>It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.</i>

32
00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:52.882
<i>I think it's payback time for a tea party
they threw for us a few hundred years ago.</i>

33
00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.219
<i>I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap</i>

34
00:02:56.302 --> 00:02:59.723
<i>where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter
of Ass-erica belongs!</i>

35
00:02:59.806 --> 00:03:02.267
<i>Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?</i>

36
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.061
<i>Did you like that?</i>

37
00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:09.399
<i>USA, Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.
I mean, what else can you say?</i>

38
00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:13.153
<i>Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything,</i>

39
00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:15.655
<i>and now, 20 years later, is what?</i>

40
00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.451
<i>The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</i>

41
00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:21.745
<i>Godlessness.</i>

42
00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:23.496
<i>Let me say that again.</i>

43
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.956
<i>Godlessness.</i>

44
00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:28.668
<i>It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

45
00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:31.129
<i>It was Judgment.</i>

46
00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:35.383
<i>No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.</i>

47
00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:38.803
<i>You think he's not up there?</i>

48
00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:41.473
<i>You think he's not watching over
this country?</i>

49
00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:45.852
<i>How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.</i>

50
00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:47.437
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

51
00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.691
<i>Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.</i>

52
00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:54.194
<i>Immigrants, Muslims,</i>

53
00:03:54.527 --> 00:03:57.155
<i>homosexuals, terrorists.</i>

54
00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:01.242
<i>Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go.</i>

55
00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:04.579
<i>Strength through unity.
Unity through faith.</i>

56
00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:08.917
<i>I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it!</i>

57
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.211
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

58
00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:14.672
Oh, shit.

59
00:04:16.883 --> 00:04:20.595
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

60
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:24.140
<i>Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.</i>

61
00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:26.726
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

62
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.188
<i>A yellow-coded curfew
is now in effect.</i>

63
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:33.817
<i>Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.</i>

64
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.360
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

65
00:04:36.903 --> 00:04:39.531
- Whoa! Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

66
00:04:39.614 --> 00:04:41.366
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

67
00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.244
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

68
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:47.956
- Sick uncle? What you think, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

69
00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.126
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

70
00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:54.587
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

71
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:56.923
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

72
00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:59.926
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

73
00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.763
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

74
00:05:03.847 --> 00:05:06.683
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

75
00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:08.476
You know what that means,
don't you?

76
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.354
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

77
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:13.398
And you get to swallow it.

78
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.721
- Oh, God, you're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

79
00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:17.569
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:19.821
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

81
00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:23.324
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

82
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.035
then you'll certainly be the sorest.

83
00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.791
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

84
00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:34.460
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

85
00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:37.881
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

86
00:05:37.964 --> 00:05:39.591
Help me! Someone help!

87
00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:43.094
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

88
00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:46.365
- What the hell?
- Bugger off!

89
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.600
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel

90
00:05:48.683 --> 00:05:50.602
which smoked with bloody execution.

91
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.312
We're Fingermen, pal.

92
00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:14.500
Aha!

93
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:29.265
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

94
00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.517
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

95
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:33.770
...that with devotion's visage
and pious action

96
00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:35.521
we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

97
00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:38.358
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

98
00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:46.032
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

99
00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:47.867
- Who are you?
- Who?

100
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:50.495
Who is but the form
following the function of what

101
00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:52.497
and what I am is a man in a mask.

102
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.666
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

103
00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:57.043
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

104
00:06:57.126 --> 00:07:01.256
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

105
00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:06.094
- Oh. Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights

106
00:07:06.177 --> 00:07:09.555
permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet

107
00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.850
to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

108
00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:15.645
VoilÃ !

109
00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:17.814
In view, a humble
vaudevillian veteran

110
00:07:17.897 --> 00:07:22.151
cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

111
00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:25.029
This visage,
no mere veneer of vanity

112
00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:28.700
is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

113
00:07:28.783 --> 00:07:33.204
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified

114
00:07:33.288 --> 00:07:37.292
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice

115
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:41.045
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

116
00:07:47.218 --> 00:07:50.388
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta

117
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.350
held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such

118
00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:57.687
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

119
00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:04.235
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

120
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:07.322
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you

121
00:08:07.405 --> 00:08:09.157
and you may call me V.

122
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:13.453
Are you, like, a crazy person?

123
00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.663
I am quite sure they will say so.

124
00:08:15.747 --> 00:08:17.749
But to whom, might I ask,
am I speaking?

125
00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:21.836
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

126
00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:24.339
E-vey. Of course you are.

127
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.258
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God,

128
00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:30.636
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

129
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.638
Are you hurt?

130
00:08:32.722 --> 00:08:34.474
No, I'm fine.

131
00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:38.353
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

132
00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:42.231
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

133
00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:44.442
You see, I'm a musician of sorts

134
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.986
and on my way to give
a very special performance.

135
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.696
What kind of musician?

136
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.782
Percussion instruments are my speciality.

137
00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:54.285
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event

138
00:08:54.369 --> 00:08:56.496
and would be honored
if you could join me.

139
00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:58.790
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

140
00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.501
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

141
00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:04.420
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

142
00:09:06.798 --> 00:09:07.840
All right.

143
00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:11.260
It's beautiful up here.

144
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:15.807
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

145
00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:17.517
I don't see any instruments.

146
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.561
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

147
00:09:21.312 --> 00:09:26.025
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto

148
00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:29.487
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts

149
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.658
and in recognition of the impostor
that stands in her stead.

150
00:09:34.534 --> 00:09:37.036
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

151
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.287
Um...

152
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:41.624
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

153
00:09:47.463 --> 00:09:51.050
<i>Remember, remember
The 5th of November</i>

154
00:09:51.134 --> 00:09:54.303
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

155
00:09:54.387 --> 00:09:57.432
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

156
00:09:57.515 --> 00:10:00.101
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

157
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.816
First, the overture.

158
00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:09.861
Yes.

159
00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:12.321
Yes, the strings.

160
00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:15.950
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

161
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.245
Now the brass.

162
00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:21.164
I can hear it!

163
00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:30.214
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

164
00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:37.096
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

165
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.140
Here comes the crescendo!

166
00:10:46.898 --> 00:10:49.233
How beautiful, is it not?

167
00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:05.082
<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

168
00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:08.211
The Bailey area is quarantined.

169
00:11:08.294 --> 00:11:10.630
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

170
00:11:10.713 --> 00:11:12.006
<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

171
00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:16.219
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

172
00:11:16.302 --> 00:11:19.138
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
<i>1812 Overture.</i>

173
00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:21.766
<i>Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that music again.</i>

174
00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.142
Yes, sir.

175
00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:27.063
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance

176
00:11:27.146 --> 00:11:30.816
indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.

177
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.902
<i>Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?</i>

178
00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:35.571
We're calling it
an emergency demolition.

179
00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:38.699
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

180
00:11:38.783 --> 00:11:43.079
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

181
00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:46.207
<i>I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings</i>

182
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.835
<i>and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

183
00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:53.673
<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time</i>

184
00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:56.968
<i>and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

185
00:11:57.176 --> 00:11:58.386
<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

186
00:11:58.469 --> 00:12:01.764
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist

187
00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:05.309
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

188
00:12:05.393 --> 00:12:10.606
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

189
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.109
<i>- Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Not sure yet, sir.

190
00:12:13.192 --> 00:12:15.820
- But we're working on several leads.
<i>- Anything else?</i>

191
00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:17.780
We located the fireworks launch

192
00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:20.825
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

193
00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:26.247
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication

194
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.126
these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals

195
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:32.753
making them very difficult to trace.

196
00:12:34.005 --> 00:12:36.757
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

197
00:12:36.966 --> 00:12:40.344
<i>Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

198
00:12:40.428 --> 00:12:42.221
Apologies, chancellor.

199
00:12:42.305 --> 00:12:44.015
<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

200
00:12:44.098 --> 00:12:46.851
<i>Moments such as these
are matters of faith.</i>

201
00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:50.229
<i>To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe,</i>

202
00:12:50.313 --> 00:12:52.023
<i>everything we have fought for.</i>

203
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:57.153
<i>Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

204
00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:59.864
<i>Gentlemen, I want this
terrorist found</i>

205
00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:04.410
<i>and I want him to understand
what terror really means.</i>

206
00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:05.995
<i>England prevails.</i>

207
00:13:06.454 --> 00:13:08.748
England prevails.

208
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:18.257
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

209
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:20.343
This is the BTN.

210
00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:23.220
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

211
00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:25.890
That's the government's job.

212
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:29.143
On the lighter side of things

213
00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:32.855
seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey

214
00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:37.360
wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

215
00:13:37.443 --> 00:13:40.154
<i>Although the demolition had been
planned for some time</i>

216
00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:43.407
<i>the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief,</i>

217
00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:46.452
<i>- "definitely not on the schedule."
- We'll be right back.</i>

218
00:13:46.535 --> 00:13:50.414
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

219
00:13:50.498 --> 00:13:52.041
I saw it, the whole thing.

220
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.919
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

221
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:58.381
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

222
00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:01.092
Evey, there you are.

223
00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.427
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

224
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:05.930
I need two espressos and three coffees.

225
00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:08.099
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

226
00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:11.560
I don't get it.

227
00:14:11.644 --> 00:14:14.188
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask
and then blow up the Bailey?

228
00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:15.871
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

229
00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:19.944
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

230
00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:22.405
Maybe he's just getting started.

231
00:14:24.115 --> 00:14:25.616
Yeah?

232
00:14:26.117 --> 00:14:28.119
Okay. A lead on the girl.

233
00:14:28.244 --> 00:14:31.205
Look, don't get me wrong,
I love it. A cow getting crucified.

234
00:14:31.622 --> 00:14:34.583
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

235
00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:37.420
You've got to rewrite it, okay? Gotta go.

236
00:14:38.462 --> 00:14:41.257
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

237
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.134
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

238
00:14:43.217 --> 00:14:45.845
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

239
00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:47.638
Gordon...

240
00:14:47.847 --> 00:14:50.766
I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen

241
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.518
and I got scared and went home.

242
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:57.148
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

243
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:16.000
Gotcha.

244
00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:21.380
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

245
00:15:21.464 --> 00:15:23.382
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

246
00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:25.801
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

247
00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:29.305
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

248
00:15:29.388 --> 00:15:31.390
Laser Lass is banging.

249
00:15:45.237 --> 00:15:46.280
What's all that?

250
00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.575
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

251
00:15:49.658 --> 00:15:51.410
Must be Prothero.

252
00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:55.915
I wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain't his playground.

253
00:15:57.875 --> 00:15:59.585
What the hell is this?

254
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.382
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

255
00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:09.887
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

256
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.182
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

257
00:16:13.265 --> 00:16:15.601
Juvenile Reclamation Project

258
00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.977
- for five years.
- Shit.

259
00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:19.563
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

260
00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:21.065
You sure about that, sir?

261
00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.691
I want a chance to talk to her

262
00:16:22.775 --> 00:16:25.402
before she disappears
into one of Creedy's black bags.

263
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.749
Who's that?

264
00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:42.753
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

265
00:16:48.884 --> 00:16:50.094
Fucking hell.

266
00:16:52.972 --> 00:16:54.640
Come on, let's move!

267
00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:17.246
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

268
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.164
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

269
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.461
<i>Will all personnel please
evacuate the building.</i>

270
00:17:25.296 --> 00:17:26.964
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

271
00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:30.175
<i>Will all personnel evacuate the building.</i>

272
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.474
What the hell's going on?

273
00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:39.643
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

274
00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:46.817
Dominic!

275
00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.236
Police! Out of the way!

276
00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:52.531
Get out the way!

277
00:18:00.164 --> 00:18:01.498
Damn it!

278
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.421
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.</i>

279
00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:10.257
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails.</i>

280
00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.054
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

281
00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:18.182
<i>Help, Storm, help!</i>

282
00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:30.819
Don't touch it.

283
00:18:30.903 --> 00:18:33.072
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

284
00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.798
<i>Good evening, London.</i>

285
00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:54.259
<i>- Allow me first to apologize.</i>
- That's the emergency channel!

286
00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:58.597
<i>I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine</i>

287
00:18:58.681 --> 00:19:02.768
<i>the security of the familiar,
the tranquility of repetition.</i>

288
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.061
Bloody hell.

289
00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:08.065
<i>I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration...</i>

290
00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.106
- Who's that, Mum?
- Shh.

291
00:19:09.108 --> 00:19:11.026
<i>...whereby important events
of the past</i>

292
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.237
<i>usually associated
with someone's death</i>

293
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.322
<i>or the end of some awful,
bloody struggle</i>

294
00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:18.033
<i>are celebrated with a nice holiday</i>

295
00:19:18.117 --> 00:19:20.744
<i>I thought we could mark
this November the 5th</i>

296
00:19:20.828 --> 00:19:23.163
<i>a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered</i>

297
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.002
<i>by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat.</i>

298
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:31.130
<i>There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.</i>

299
00:19:31.213 --> 00:19:32.548
Let me think, let me think.

300
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:35.092
<i>Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones</i>

301
00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.594
<i>and men with guns
will soon be on their way.</i>

302
00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:39.596
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

303
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.143
<i>Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation</i>

304
00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:47.104
<i>words will always retain their power.</i>

305
00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.732
<i>Words offer the means to meaning</i>

306
00:19:49.815 --> 00:19:53.110
<i>and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.</i>

307
00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.653
<i>And the truth is</i>

308
00:19:54.737 --> 00:19:58.240
<i>there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?</i>

309
00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:01.785
You designed it, you wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

310
00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:05.581
<i>Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.</i>

311
00:20:05.664 --> 00:20:08.083
<i>And where once
you had the freedom to object</i>

312
00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:10.044
<i>to think and speak as you saw fit</i>

313
00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:13.422
<i>you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity</i>

314
00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:16.508
<i>- and soliciting submission.</i>
- Cameras. We need cameras.

315
00:20:16.592 --> 00:20:19.344
<i>How did this happen?
Who's to blame?</i>

316
00:20:19.762 --> 00:20:22.723
<i>Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.</i>

317
00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:24.808
<i>And they will be held accountable.</i>

318
00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:27.895
<i>But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty</i>

319
00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.773
<i>you need only look into a mirror.</i>

320
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.150
<i>I know why you did it.</i>

321
00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:35.027
<i>I know you were afraid.</i>

322
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.697
<i>Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.</i>

323
00:20:38.781 --> 00:20:41.575
<i>There were a myriad of problems
which conspired</i>

324
00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:45.120
<i>to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.</i>

325
00:20:45.204 --> 00:20:46.872
<i>Fear got the best of you.</i>

326
00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:51.293
<i>And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</i>

327
00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:54.046
<i>He promised you order,
he promised you peace</i>

328
00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:57.925
<i>and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.</i>

329
00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:01.845
- Inspector, they're almost through.
<i>- Last night, I sought to end that silence.</i>

330
00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:04.389
<i>Last night, I destroyed the Old Bailey</i>

331
00:21:04.473 --> 00:21:07.893
<i>to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.</i>

332
00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:13.357
<i>More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November</i>

333
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.983
<i>forever in our memory.</i>

334
00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:18.862
<i>His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom</i>

335
00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:20.989
<i>are more than words.</i>

336
00:21:21.198 --> 00:21:22.783
<i>They are perspectives.</i>

337
00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:24.827
<i>So if you've seen nothing,</i>

338
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.747
<i>if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you,</i>

339
00:21:28.831 --> 00:21:33.210
<i>then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</i>

340
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:36.505
<i>But if you see what I see,</i>

341
00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:41.260
<i>if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek,</i>

342
00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:44.304
<i>then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight</i>

343
00:21:44.388 --> 00:21:46.682
<i>outside the gates of Parliament.</i>

344
00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:49.601
<i>And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November</i>

345
00:21:49.685 --> 00:21:52.855
<i>that shall never, ever be forgot.</i>

346
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:01.238
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

347
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:02.948
Cover the exits.

348
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:05.826
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

349
00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:10.497
Left.

350
00:22:10.581 --> 00:22:12.040
You go right.

351
00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:13.834
Spread out.

352
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.552
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

353
00:22:25.804 --> 00:22:27.389
Hold your fire!

354
00:22:34.021 --> 00:22:35.564
He put masks on all of us.

355
00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:37.024
Jesus.

356
00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:38.650
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

357
00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:40.459
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

358
00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.779
Freeze! Nobody move!

359
00:22:42.863 --> 00:22:45.240
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

360
00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:52.497
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

361
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.251
There's a bomb in the control booth.

362
00:22:56.335 --> 00:22:58.003
Oh, no.

363
00:22:59.087 --> 00:23:02.466
- Get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

364
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:04.927
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

365
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.595
Everyone else, let's go.

366
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.605
Good God.

367
00:23:16.688 --> 00:23:19.107
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

368
00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:29.993
Dascomb.

369
00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:34.039
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

370
00:23:34.122 --> 00:23:36.250
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

371
00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:37.542
Wait, wait!

372
00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:41.213
Don't shoot me, please!
It's him! It's him!

373
00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.883
On your knees! On your knees!

374
00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.479
Please! Please don't hurt me!

375
00:24:14.496 --> 00:24:16.164
Here we go.

376
00:24:21.962 --> 00:24:23.171
I did it.

377
00:24:23.547 --> 00:24:24.798
I did it.

378
00:24:29.636 --> 00:24:31.013
Freeze!

379
00:24:31.096 --> 00:24:33.932
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

380
00:24:35.684 --> 00:24:40.397
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

381
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:44.651
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

382
00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:47.446
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

383
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:48.905
Oh, I don't know about that.

384
00:24:51.074 --> 00:24:52.159
Aah!

385
00:25:03.337 --> 00:25:07.716
<i>We're interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report</i>

386
00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:11.511
<i>of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower
which ended only moments ago.</i>

387
00:25:11.595 --> 00:25:14.931
<i>A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V</i>

388
00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:19.061
<i>attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons</i>

389
00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:23.315
<i>that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate.</i>

390
00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:28.070
<i>We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.</i>

391
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:31.907
<i>Stop!
Stop, stay where you are, or we'll shoot!</i>

392
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.950
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

393
00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:38.455
<i>Now, this is only an initial report</i>

394
00:25:38.955 --> 00:25:42.626
<i>but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid,</i>

395
00:25:42.709 --> 00:25:44.628
<i>the terrorist was shot and killed.</i>

396
00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:46.004
Bollocks.

397
00:25:46.088 --> 00:25:49.674
<i>Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.</i>

398
00:25:49.758 --> 00:25:51.468
<i>The terrorist is dead.</i>

399
00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:58.266
Right there. What's he thinking?

400
00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:00.977
Is he considering leaving her?

401
00:26:02.187 --> 00:26:04.523
After she just saved him?

402
00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:09.778
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

403
00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:11.988
Some part of him's human.

404
00:26:12.781 --> 00:26:16.118
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

405
00:27:43.079 --> 00:27:45.707
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

406
00:27:46.249 --> 00:27:48.835
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

407
00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:51.379
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

408
00:27:51.588 --> 00:27:55.091
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

409
00:27:55.175 --> 00:27:58.178
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

410
00:27:58.261 --> 00:28:01.890
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

411
00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:04.059
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

412
00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:06.102
Stealing implies ownership.

413
00:28:06.186 --> 00:28:09.397
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

414
00:28:09.606 --> 00:28:11.358
God, if they ever find this place.

415
00:28:11.441 --> 00:28:15.487
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

416
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.906
You mean, after what you've done.

417
00:28:18.532 --> 00:28:20.784
God, what have I done?

418
00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:23.078
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

419
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:26.790
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

420
00:28:26.873 --> 00:28:28.917
I must have been out of my mind.

421
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.254
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

422
00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:34.339
I think I should go.

423
00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:36.550
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

424
00:28:36.633 --> 00:28:37.926
They're looking for you.

425
00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:40.679
If they know where you work,
they know where you live.

426
00:28:40.804 --> 00:28:45.684
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

427
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:48.937
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us

428
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.814
but I couldn't see any other way.

429
00:28:50.897 --> 00:28:53.233
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

430
00:28:53.316 --> 00:28:57.612
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

431
00:28:57.696 --> 00:29:01.700
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you

432
00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:03.827
in the pursuit of finding me.

433
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.371
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen

434
00:29:06.454 --> 00:29:10.542
so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

435
00:29:10.625 --> 00:29:12.294
Here, to my home.

436
00:29:12.836 --> 00:29:16.256
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

437
00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:18.883
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

438
00:29:18.967 --> 00:29:21.052
But I don't even know where this is.

439
00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:22.470
You know it's underground.

440
00:29:22.554 --> 00:29:24.180
You know the color of the stone.

441
00:29:24.264 --> 00:29:28.393
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

442
00:29:28.476 --> 00:29:31.938
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.

443
00:29:32.022 --> 00:29:34.065
You mean a year from now?

444
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:35.984
I have to stay here for a year?

445
00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:39.237
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

446
00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:41.031
You should've left me alone.

447
00:29:41.197 --> 00:29:43.491
Why didn't you just leave me alone?

448
00:29:46.328 --> 00:29:49.497
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

449
00:29:49.706 --> 00:29:51.750
They were interned at Belmarsh.

450
00:29:51.833 --> 00:29:53.627
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

451
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.213
She died in a hunger strike. He died
when the military retook the shed.

452
00:29:57.547 --> 00:30:00.634
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

453
00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:03.970
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

454
00:30:04.387 --> 00:30:07.849
So we know her story.
Now we need his.

455
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:30.872
V?

456
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.500
Ah<i>. Bonjour</i>, mademoiselle.

457
00:30:33.583 --> 00:30:37.087
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

458
00:30:37.754 --> 00:30:41.925
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

459
00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:44.469
Your hands.

460
00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:47.430
Yes.

461
00:30:51.643 --> 00:30:53.436
There, that's better.

462
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.689
I hope I didn't put you off
your appetite.

463
00:30:55.772 --> 00:30:59.567
- No, please. It's just... Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

464
00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:01.194
Can I ask what happened?

465
00:31:02.195 --> 00:31:05.323
There was a fire. A long time ago.

466
00:31:05.407 --> 00:31:07.617
Ancient history, for some.

467
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:09.661
Not really very good
table conversation.

468
00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:12.414
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

469
00:31:12.872 --> 00:31:16.209
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

470
00:31:22.298 --> 00:31:23.800
Mmm.

471
00:31:24.175 --> 00:31:26.970
- It's delicious.
- Good.

472
00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:30.223
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

473
00:31:30.306 --> 00:31:31.599
Where did you get it?

474
00:31:31.808 --> 00:31:34.936
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

475
00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:38.815
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

476
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.275
You're insane.

477
00:31:40.358 --> 00:31:44.320
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

478
00:31:44.404 --> 00:31:46.906
<i>- Macbeth.</i>
- Very good.

479
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.993
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me

480
00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:52.454
and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

481
00:31:52.537 --> 00:31:54.998
Be in plays, movies.

482
00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:58.752
When I was 9, I played Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night.</i> Mum was very proud.

483
00:31:58.835 --> 00:32:01.004
Where is your mother now?

484
00:32:01.087 --> 00:32:02.964
She's dead.

485
00:32:03.047 --> 00:32:04.340
I'm sorry.

486
00:32:06.634 --> 00:32:09.137
Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?

487
00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:10.930
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

488
00:32:11.014 --> 00:32:15.059
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

489
00:32:15.143 --> 00:32:17.520
There's no certainty,
only opportunity.

490
00:32:17.604 --> 00:32:20.231
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up,

491
00:32:20.315 --> 00:32:22.275
Creedy'll black-bag
every one of them.

492
00:32:22.567 --> 00:32:25.028
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

493
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:27.071
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

494
00:32:27.155 --> 00:32:29.616
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

495
00:32:30.867 --> 00:32:34.370
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

496
00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:36.247
Symbols are given power by people.

497
00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:40.168
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people,

498
00:32:40.376 --> 00:32:43.004
blowing up a building
can change the world.

499
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.965
I wish I believed that was possible.

500
00:32:46.382 --> 00:32:50.678
Every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

501
00:32:50.887 --> 00:32:53.348
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.</i>

502
00:32:54.974 --> 00:32:56.100
What is he?

503
00:32:56.184 --> 00:32:58.061
<i>A man does not wear a mask.</i>

504
00:32:58.144 --> 00:33:01.439
- What is he?
<i>- A man does not threaten civilians.</i>

505
00:33:01.898 --> 00:33:05.109
<i>He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

506
00:33:05.193 --> 00:33:07.529
<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

507
00:33:10.532 --> 00:33:12.033
There will be no negotiation.

508
00:33:12.116 --> 00:33:14.702
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

509
00:33:14.786 --> 00:33:18.373
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

510
00:33:18.456 --> 00:33:21.209
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

511
00:33:21.334 --> 00:33:24.879
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

512
00:33:24.963 --> 00:33:27.841
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

513
00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:31.219
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

514
00:33:33.763 --> 00:33:35.306
<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

515
00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:37.475
<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

516
00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:39.853
<i>I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.</i>

517
00:33:39.936 --> 00:33:42.397
<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

518
00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:51.030
<i>This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond</i>

519
00:33:51.114 --> 00:33:54.492
<i>neo-demagogues,
spouting their message of hate.</i>

520
00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:59.247
<i>A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

521
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.126
<i>An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

522
00:34:03.209 --> 00:34:06.087
- No mercy!
<i>- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

523
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:08.464
Good guys win, bad guys lose

524
00:34:08.548 --> 00:34:11.968
and, as always, England prevails!

525
00:34:14.012 --> 00:34:15.972
Holy Christ! Jesus!

526
00:34:17.265 --> 00:34:19.225
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

527
00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:21.978
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

528
00:34:22.061 --> 00:34:25.273
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by

529
00:34:25.356 --> 00:34:27.692
any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

530
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:29.611
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

531
00:34:29.986 --> 00:34:34.574
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

532
00:34:34.657 --> 00:34:36.492
You wore a uniform in those days.

533
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:41.205
You.

534
00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:46.127
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

535
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:58.056
- Yeah?
<i>- Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

536
00:34:58.348 --> 00:35:00.934
- Dascomb.
<i>- I've already called the chancellor.</i>

537
00:35:01.017 --> 00:35:04.812
<i>- We have to get control of the situation.</i>
- What situation?

538
00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:10.401
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

539
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:13.154
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London

540
00:35:13.237 --> 00:35:15.323
could be devastating
to our credibility.

541
00:35:16.658 --> 00:35:18.284
Perhaps a stroke?

542
00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:21.245
No, no, it's too horrific.

543
00:35:21.329 --> 00:35:25.124
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

544
00:35:26.376 --> 00:35:29.087
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

545
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:33.758
It's the same M.O. as before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

546
00:35:33.841 --> 00:35:37.261
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

547
00:35:38.888 --> 00:35:40.139
V?

548
00:35:46.354 --> 00:35:48.314
My fat, metal friend.

549
00:36:00.952 --> 00:36:02.870
Mondego.

550
00:36:07.917 --> 00:36:11.587
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

551
00:36:12.088 --> 00:36:15.383
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

552
00:36:15.591 --> 00:36:16.884
My favorite film:

553
00:36:16.968 --> 00:36:21.556
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i>
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

554
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:24.976
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</i>

555
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.687
It gets me every time.

556
00:36:28.104 --> 00:36:29.897
- Never seen it.
- Really?

557
00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:33.317
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

558
00:36:33.651 --> 00:36:35.737
As only celluloid can deliver.

559
00:36:36.112 --> 00:36:37.613
Okay.

560
00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:39.741
Put the sword away.

561
00:36:40.283 --> 00:36:42.201
Forensics just wrapped.

562
00:36:42.744 --> 00:36:46.080
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

563
00:36:46.164 --> 00:36:48.082
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

564
00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:50.334
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

565
00:36:50.418 --> 00:36:52.045
- Interesting.
- Why?

566
00:36:52.128 --> 00:36:55.631
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country

567
00:36:55.715 --> 00:36:57.550
before he was the Voice of London?

568
00:36:57.633 --> 00:37:00.178
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

569
00:37:00.261 --> 00:37:03.139
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

570
00:37:03.222 --> 00:37:07.518
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

571
00:37:07.602 --> 00:37:11.189
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

572
00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:13.691
<i>May we come up?</i>

573
00:37:14.734 --> 00:37:17.403
- <i>You find your own tree.</i>
- You find your own tree.

574
00:37:22.784 --> 00:37:24.911
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

575
00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:28.915
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

576
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:32.919
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

577
00:37:34.796 --> 00:37:37.673
<i>...nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular...</i>

578
00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:39.050
Wait. What's this?

579
00:37:39.133 --> 00:37:41.928
<i>...most awarded stars
in the history of the BTN</i>

580
00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:45.223
<i>a man known to the entire nation
as "The Voice of London"</i>

581
00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:48.184
<i>passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure.</i>

582
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.605
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

583
00:37:52.688 --> 00:37:55.775
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

584
00:37:55.858 --> 00:37:58.111
<i>It came as no surprise
to those who knew him</i>

585
00:37:58.194 --> 00:37:59.987
<i>that his body was at his office</i>

586
00:38:00.071 --> 00:38:03.908
<i>where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home.</i>

587
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:06.577
<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

588
00:38:13.042 --> 00:38:16.295
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

589
00:38:16.379 --> 00:38:18.131
You didn't take it, did you?

590
00:38:18.714 --> 00:38:21.342
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

591
00:38:23.052 --> 00:38:25.304
Did you have anything
to do with that?

592
00:38:25.388 --> 00:38:28.391
- Yes, I killed him.
- You.

593
00:38:28.474 --> 00:38:30.017
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

594
00:38:30.226 --> 00:38:32.687
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

595
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:36.232
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

596
00:38:36.315 --> 00:38:38.860
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

597
00:38:39.235 --> 00:38:41.779
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

598
00:38:44.574 --> 00:38:48.244
Oh, I see.

599
00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:51.247
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

600
00:38:52.665 --> 00:38:54.750
And are you going to kill more people?

601
00:38:56.085 --> 00:38:57.503
Yes.

602
00:38:58.129 --> 00:39:00.006
Take a look at this.

603
00:39:00.089 --> 00:39:02.592
Prothero's military record.

604
00:39:03.509 --> 00:39:04.927
What do you see?

605
00:39:05.845 --> 00:39:12.059
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

606
00:39:12.268 --> 00:39:13.895
- Busy boy.
- But after all that

607
00:39:13.978 --> 00:39:17.732
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

608
00:39:17.815 --> 00:39:20.651
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

609
00:39:21.903 --> 00:39:24.822
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

610
00:39:24.906 --> 00:39:28.826
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

611
00:39:29.202 --> 00:39:33.372
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

612
00:39:33.456 --> 00:39:38.878
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

613
00:39:38.961 --> 00:39:42.423
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

614
00:39:42.506 --> 00:39:46.093
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill

615
00:39:46.302 --> 00:39:48.804
approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

616
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.097
Well, there you have it.

617
00:39:52.058 --> 00:39:54.602
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

618
00:39:54.685 --> 00:39:57.939
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

619
00:39:58.314 --> 00:40:00.483
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

620
00:40:00.566 --> 00:40:03.361
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

621
00:40:03.903 --> 00:40:06.614
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

622
00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:09.742
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

623
00:40:09.825 --> 00:40:13.120
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

624
00:40:13.204 --> 00:40:17.833
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

625
00:40:17.917 --> 00:40:19.919
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

626
00:40:20.002 --> 00:40:23.923
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

627
00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:26.842
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

628
00:40:26.926 --> 00:40:29.595
We all did what we had to do.

629
00:40:29.679 --> 00:40:33.015
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

630
00:40:33.099 --> 00:40:34.976
That's all I have to say about that.

631
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.067
You can do this.

632
00:40:53.202 --> 00:40:54.662
Hi.

633
00:40:55.871 --> 00:40:57.873
I've been thinking.

634
00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:01.168
There's something
I want to ask you

635
00:41:01.252 --> 00:41:05.172
but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

636
00:41:07.508 --> 00:41:10.928
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

637
00:41:11.887 --> 00:41:14.307
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth

638
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.892
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

639
00:41:17.018 --> 00:41:19.186
A man after my own heart.

640
00:41:19.395 --> 00:41:22.023
He always told the best stories.

641
00:41:23.274 --> 00:41:25.526
Until my brother died.

642
00:41:27.945 --> 00:41:29.822
That was when everything changed.

643
00:41:30.698 --> 00:41:34.201
<i>My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.</i>

644
00:41:34.285 --> 00:41:38.164
<i>After he died,
my parents became political.</i>

645
00:41:40.082 --> 00:41:43.711
<i>They protested the war
and the Reclamation.</i>

646
00:41:43.919 --> 00:41:46.213
<i>When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,</i>

647
00:41:46.297 --> 00:41:48.591
<i>they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

648
00:41:48.674 --> 00:41:50.718
<i>I watched on the television,</i>

649
00:41:50.926 --> 00:41:53.304
<i>thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.</i>

650
00:41:53.929 --> 00:41:56.390
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

651
00:41:56.474 --> 00:41:59.894
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.</i>

652
00:41:59.977 --> 00:42:03.105
<i>He said if we ran away,
they would win.</i>

653
00:42:03.189 --> 00:42:05.066
<i>Win, like</i>

654
00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:06.400
<i>it was a game.</i>

655
00:42:09.153 --> 00:42:10.529
Evey, quick, hide!

656
00:42:25.503 --> 00:42:27.463
- Mummy!
- Evey!

657
00:42:27.546 --> 00:42:29.006
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

658
00:42:29.548 --> 00:42:33.344
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

659
00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:35.262
I'm sorry, Evey.

660
00:42:35.471 --> 00:42:38.099
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

661
00:42:38.182 --> 00:42:40.559
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

662
00:42:40.643 --> 00:42:43.687
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

663
00:42:45.064 --> 00:42:46.565
but I'm not.

664
00:42:47.274 --> 00:42:50.486
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

665
00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:53.614
but I am.

666
00:42:53.697 --> 00:42:57.284
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

667
00:42:57.493 --> 00:43:02.289
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right,

668
00:43:03.541 --> 00:43:05.459
please let me know.

669
00:43:05.543 --> 00:43:07.253
If you wish.

670
00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:17.513
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

671
00:43:17.596 --> 00:43:19.140
Worth a shot.

672
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.143
One thing is true of all governments:

673
00:43:22.226 --> 00:43:26.063
The most reliable records are tax records.

674
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:35.906
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

675
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.994
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

676
00:43:40.077 --> 00:43:44.165
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

677
00:43:44.248 --> 00:43:46.584
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

678
00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:49.170
Thanks. This is a great help.

679
00:44:00.598 --> 00:44:04.185
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

680
00:44:04.268 --> 00:44:07.480
- Personal motto?
- From <i>Faust.</i>

681
00:44:07.563 --> 00:44:10.065
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

682
00:44:10.191 --> 00:44:12.359
It is. And speaking of the devil,

683
00:44:12.568 --> 00:44:15.362
I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

684
00:44:15.446 --> 00:44:17.865
- Of course.
- It appears that unforeseen circumstances

685
00:44:17.948 --> 00:44:20.826
have accelerated my original plan.

686
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:24.747
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

687
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.123
I'll do my best.

688
00:44:26.624 --> 00:44:28.375
I believe you will.

689
00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:36.884
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

690
00:44:37.092 --> 00:44:38.969
I don't know, but this is interesting.

691
00:44:39.053 --> 00:44:42.598
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

692
00:44:42.681 --> 00:44:45.893
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

693
00:44:45.976 --> 00:44:49.855
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

694
00:44:50.689 --> 00:44:52.233
Now, that is interesting.

695
00:44:53.734 --> 00:44:56.820
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

696
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:02.243
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

697
00:45:02.326 --> 00:45:04.119
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

698
00:45:04.203 --> 00:45:06.413
I've just received
your InterLink itinerary.

699
00:45:06.497 --> 00:45:09.416
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

700
00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:11.126
You're most diligent, Denis,

701
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:15.256
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

702
00:45:15.339 --> 00:45:17.925
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

703
00:45:18.008 --> 00:45:21.136
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

704
00:45:21.804 --> 00:45:23.597
My last little joy.

705
00:45:23.681 --> 00:45:25.474
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

706
00:45:26.684 --> 00:45:30.020
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

707
00:45:30.104 --> 00:45:33.440
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

708
00:45:33.524 --> 00:45:34.942
Older?

709
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.319
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

710
00:45:37.444 --> 00:45:39.697
That is for Your Grace to decide.

711
00:45:51.834 --> 00:45:54.461
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

712
00:45:56.088 --> 00:46:01.093
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

713
00:46:03.012 --> 00:46:05.723
Mea culpa, my child.

714
00:46:05.806 --> 00:46:07.182
Mea culpa.

715
00:46:12.771 --> 00:46:16.191
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

716
00:46:16.275 --> 00:46:20.362
A confession? I love the confession game.

717
00:46:20.863 --> 00:46:22.489
Tell me your sins.

718
00:46:22.573 --> 00:46:24.491
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

719
00:46:24.575 --> 00:46:26.910
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

720
00:46:27.202 --> 00:46:28.871
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this

721
00:46:28.954 --> 00:46:31.624
because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

722
00:46:31.707 --> 00:46:35.461
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

723
00:46:35.544 --> 00:46:38.756
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

724
00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:40.758
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

725
00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:44.136
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

726
00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:47.556
I'm telling you that, any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

727
00:46:47.765 --> 00:46:51.143
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

728
00:46:51.226 --> 00:46:53.604
Wonderful!

729
00:46:53.687 --> 00:46:56.023
It's a game I've never played!

730
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:58.233
What a delightful mind you have.

731
00:46:58.317 --> 00:47:00.235
I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.

732
00:47:00.319 --> 00:47:03.656
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

733
00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:05.949
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

734
00:47:06.033 --> 00:47:07.493
Stop it! Get off of me!

735
00:47:07.785 --> 00:47:09.828
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

736
00:47:09.912 --> 00:47:12.039
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

737
00:47:12.623 --> 00:47:13.749
Oh!

738
00:47:14.166 --> 00:47:17.127
You little bitch.
You fucking little whore!

739
00:47:20.047 --> 00:47:21.715
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

740
00:47:21.799 --> 00:47:23.550
She wasn't lying. It is you.

741
00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:25.761
I'm sorry.

742
00:47:25.844 --> 00:47:27.680
- I had to.
- Evey!

743
00:47:32.393 --> 00:47:34.561
And thus I clothe my naked villainy

744
00:47:34.645 --> 00:47:37.773
with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ

745
00:47:37.856 --> 00:47:41.068
and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

746
00:47:41.151 --> 00:47:43.153
Oh, please, have mercy.

747
00:47:43.362 --> 00:47:45.280
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

748
00:47:45.406 --> 00:47:47.116
<i>Not tonight.</i>

749
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.745
<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

750
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:53.622
Well, then.
Children's hour at the abbey.

751
00:47:53.706 --> 00:47:55.791
<i>Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.</i>

752
00:47:55.874 --> 00:47:59.294
- What the...?
<i>- I don't want to die!</i>

753
00:48:00.087 --> 00:48:02.631
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

754
00:48:05.342 --> 00:48:09.179
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

755
00:48:09.263 --> 00:48:10.973
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

756
00:48:11.348 --> 00:48:13.726
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

757
00:48:14.476 --> 00:48:17.187
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

758
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.318
Creedy.

759
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.862
What are you doing here?

760
00:48:25.821 --> 00:48:29.950
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

761
00:48:30.033 --> 00:48:34.329
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

762
00:48:34.413 --> 00:48:37.332
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

763
00:48:37.416 --> 00:48:40.502
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

764
00:48:40.586 --> 00:48:43.839
The security of information is paramount.

765
00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:45.883
In these volatile times,

766
00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:48.886
mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated,

767
00:48:48.969 --> 00:48:51.430
if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

768
00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:53.849
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have

769
00:48:53.932 --> 00:48:56.643
a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

770
00:48:56.727 --> 00:48:59.563
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

771
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.316
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

772
00:49:02.399 --> 00:49:04.234
At this time, it would behoove you

773
00:49:04.318 --> 00:49:09.406
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed

774
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.951
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

775
00:49:13.619 --> 00:49:14.953
You mean Larkhill?

776
00:49:15.037 --> 00:49:18.665
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

777
00:49:18.874 --> 00:49:22.085
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

778
00:49:23.295 --> 00:49:26.173
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

779
00:49:26.882 --> 00:49:30.010
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

780
00:49:31.637 --> 00:49:33.931
I've been a party member for 27 years.

781
00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:36.391
If I were you, chief inspector,

782
00:49:36.475 --> 00:49:38.685
I'd find the terrorist

783
00:49:38.894 --> 00:49:40.771
and I'd find him soon.

784
00:49:44.107 --> 00:49:45.692
Please.

785
00:49:49.905 --> 00:49:52.032
Evey? Good God!

786
00:49:52.115 --> 00:49:54.701
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.

787
00:49:56.662 --> 00:49:59.665
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

788
00:50:08.173 --> 00:50:11.051
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

789
00:50:11.134 --> 00:50:13.679
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

790
00:50:13.762 --> 00:50:16.223
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

791
00:50:16.306 --> 00:50:17.933
Evey, listen to me.

792
00:50:18.016 --> 00:50:21.937
If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

793
00:50:26.108 --> 00:50:27.734
You trusted me.

794
00:50:27.943 --> 00:50:30.988
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

795
00:50:44.251 --> 00:50:46.753
Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen.</i>

796
00:50:46.837 --> 00:50:49.631
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

797
00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.927
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

798
00:50:54.011 --> 00:50:56.889
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel,

799
00:50:57.097 --> 00:50:58.849
it always cheers me up.

800
00:51:00.976 --> 00:51:05.063
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

801
00:51:05.147 --> 00:51:07.357
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

802
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:09.610
But why would you keep it?

803
00:51:09.693 --> 00:51:13.030
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful or poetry moving.

804
00:51:13.113 --> 00:51:15.157
Is it worth it? If they found that here...

805
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.576
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

806
00:51:18.201 --> 00:51:20.203
Thank you, Gordon.

807
00:51:20.287 --> 00:51:22.497
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

808
00:51:22.623 --> 00:51:26.168
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

809
00:51:26.251 --> 00:51:28.503
I was on my way here, and...

810
00:51:28.587 --> 00:51:30.172
Ah.

811
00:51:30.255 --> 00:51:31.757
Yes.

812
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.512
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

813
00:51:38.347 --> 00:51:39.806
- But...
- You're wondering why

814
00:51:40.015 --> 00:51:42.559
you were invited here to supper
in the first place

815
00:51:42.643 --> 00:51:46.813
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

816
00:51:46.897 --> 00:51:50.525
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain

817
00:51:50.609 --> 00:51:53.278
young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

818
00:51:53.528 --> 00:51:57.282
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired,

819
00:51:57.366 --> 00:52:01.411
I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.

820
00:52:01.495 --> 00:52:04.539
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

821
00:52:05.832 --> 00:52:07.751
The truth is, after so many years,

822
00:52:07.834 --> 00:52:11.338
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

823
00:52:11.546 --> 00:52:15.509
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

824
00:52:15.676 --> 00:52:21.348
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

825
00:52:21.556 --> 00:52:24.559
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

826
00:52:25.727 --> 00:52:27.270
Thanks, Delia.

827
00:52:28.063 --> 00:52:31.483
Any leads on finding this guy?

828
00:52:31.566 --> 00:52:34.945
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

829
00:52:37.698 --> 00:52:40.742
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

830
00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:44.621
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

831
00:52:46.123 --> 00:52:48.458
They're believed to be extinct.

832
00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.586
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

833
00:52:52.212 --> 00:52:54.423
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

834
00:52:54.631 --> 00:52:57.175
Any information could be helpful.

835
00:52:57.968 --> 00:53:00.804
Of course.

836
00:53:00.887 --> 00:53:02.305
Excuse me.

837
00:53:03.098 --> 00:53:04.307
Yeah?

838
00:53:04.391 --> 00:53:07.352
<i>I just finished
going through the file, inspector.</i>

839
00:53:07.436 --> 00:53:08.770
<i>You better get back here.</i>

840
00:53:08.854 --> 00:53:10.355
Yeah, okay.

841
00:53:12.107 --> 00:53:15.235
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

842
00:53:16.361 --> 00:53:18.905
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

843
00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:21.616
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

844
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:25.287
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

845
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:28.040
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

846
00:53:28.623 --> 00:53:30.125
Running away?

847
00:53:30.208 --> 00:53:34.421
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

848
00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:37.007
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

849
00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:40.260
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

850
00:53:40.343 --> 00:53:43.722
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

851
00:53:56.151 --> 00:53:57.486
What? Are you sure about that?

852
00:53:57.986 --> 00:53:59.404
Okay. Thank you.

853
00:54:00.363 --> 00:54:03.784
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

854
00:54:04.159 --> 00:54:06.203
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

855
00:54:06.995 --> 00:54:08.455
Jesus, I just saw her.

856
00:54:17.506 --> 00:54:19.341
It's you, isn't it?

857
00:54:20.008 --> 00:54:23.095
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

858
00:54:24.554 --> 00:54:26.473
Thank God.

859
00:54:28.558 --> 00:54:31.228
<i>I'm sorry, but I can't get
a response from that number.</i>

860
00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:33.230
<i>There's a problem with the connection.</i>

861
00:54:33.313 --> 00:54:35.190
Jesus Christ.

862
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:37.192
He's there.

863
00:54:38.193 --> 00:54:41.613
After what happened,
after what they did,

864
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:44.116
I thought about killing myself.

865
00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:49.496
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

866
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:52.999
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

867
00:54:53.792 --> 00:54:55.377
I swear to you.

868
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.212
Read my journal.

869
00:54:57.295 --> 00:55:00.590
What they did was only possible
because of you.

870
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.096
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

871
00:55:06.179 --> 00:55:09.057
He changed the entire course
of human history.

872
00:55:10.308 --> 00:55:12.894
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

873
00:55:13.103 --> 00:55:16.273
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

874
00:55:16.356 --> 00:55:18.275
I've come for what you did.

875
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.111
It's funny.

876
00:55:21.194 --> 00:55:24.072
I was given one of your roses today.

877
00:55:25.323 --> 00:55:28.535
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

878
00:55:30.745 --> 00:55:34.374
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

879
00:55:35.458 --> 00:55:38.044
There are no coincidences, Delia.

880
00:55:38.253 --> 00:55:41.256
Only the illusion of coincidence.

881
00:55:41.339 --> 00:55:43.383
I have another rose.

882
00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:46.887
And this one is for you.

883
00:55:52.475 --> 00:55:56.396
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago

884
00:55:57.189 --> 00:55:58.982
while you slept.

885
00:56:00.025 --> 00:56:02.777
- Is there any pain?
- No.

886
00:56:02.986 --> 00:56:04.362
Thank you.

887
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:09.910
Is it meaningless to apologize?

888
00:56:10.327 --> 00:56:11.411
Never.

889
00:56:12.621 --> 00:56:14.581
I'm so sorry.

890
00:56:36.228 --> 00:56:37.938
Damn it.

891
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.318
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

892
00:56:43.401 --> 00:56:47.072
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

893
00:56:47.155 --> 00:56:50.242
<i>Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?</i>

894
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.535
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Has anyone else read it?</i>

895
00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:55.538
- No, sir.
<i>- Then let me make this perfectly clear.</i>

896
00:56:55.747 --> 00:56:59.251
<i>The contents of this document
are a matter of national security</i>

897
00:56:59.334 --> 00:57:03.255
<i>constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members</i>

898
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:06.925
<i>as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

899
00:57:07.008 --> 00:57:10.011
<i>As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified,</i>

900
00:57:10.095 --> 00:57:14.015
<i>it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist</i>

901
00:57:14.099 --> 00:57:17.852
<i>as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member</i>

902
00:57:17.936 --> 00:57:20.146
<i>who resigned for psychological reasons.</i>

903
00:57:20.647 --> 00:57:23.275
<i>Any discussion of this document
or its contents</i>

904
00:57:23.358 --> 00:57:26.361
<i>will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition</i>

905
00:57:26.444 --> 00:57:29.030
<i>if not a willful act of treason.</i>

906
00:57:29.114 --> 00:57:32.534
<i>- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Yes, sir.

907
00:57:32.617 --> 00:57:35.370
<i>You would do well, inspector,</i>

908
00:57:35.453 --> 00:57:37.914
<i>to put it out of your mind.</i>

909
00:57:47.048 --> 00:57:48.883
<i>May 23rd.</i>

910
00:57:50.176 --> 00:57:53.054
<i>My first batch of subjects arrived today</i>

911
00:57:54.097 --> 00:57:56.975
<i>and I have to admit that I'm very excited.</i>

912
00:58:00.103 --> 00:58:02.939
<i>This could be the dawn of a new age.</i>

913
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.900
<i>Nuclear power is meaningless</i>

914
00:58:06.026 --> 00:58:09.070
<i>in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population</i>

915
00:58:09.154 --> 00:58:11.281
<i>and leave its wealth intact.</i>

916
00:58:11.364 --> 00:58:14.534
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

917
00:58:15.035 --> 00:58:17.078
<i>May 27th.</i>

918
00:58:17.162 --> 00:58:20.373
<i>Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman,</i>

919
00:58:20.457 --> 00:58:24.377
<i>who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations.</i>

920
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:28.757
<i>It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

921
00:58:28.965 --> 00:58:30.800
<i>June 2nd.</i>

922
00:58:31.426 --> 00:58:35.221
<i>I keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country,</i>

923
00:58:35.305 --> 00:58:37.724
<i>if they would act any differently.</i>

924
00:58:37.807 --> 00:58:41.811
<i>They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.</i>

925
00:58:41.895 --> 00:58:44.439
<i>I find myself hating them.</i>

926
00:58:47.525 --> 00:58:49.486
<i>August the 18th.</i>

927
00:58:49.569 --> 00:58:53.448
<i>Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased.</i>

928
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:59.162
<i>No controllable pattern has yet emerged.</i>

929
00:59:00.872 --> 00:59:02.707
<i>September the 18th.</i>

930
00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:05.960
<i>There is one case that continues
to give me hope.</i>

931
00:59:06.044 --> 00:59:10.757
<i>He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.</i>

932
00:59:10.965 --> 00:59:15.470
<i>I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.</i>

933
00:59:15.553 --> 00:59:17.472
<i>The mutations seem to have triggered</i>

934
00:59:17.555 --> 00:59:21.601
<i>the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</i>

935
00:59:21.684 --> 00:59:23.937
<i>The subject said
he could no longer remember</i>

936
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.773
<i>who he was or where he was from.</i>

937
00:59:26.981 --> 00:59:30.777
<i>Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream</i>

938
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:34.489
<i>and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain.</i>

939
00:59:35.698 --> 00:59:37.200
<i>November the 5th.</i>

940
00:59:39.661 --> 00:59:42.872
<i>It started last night, around midnight.</i>

941
00:59:42.956 --> 00:59:46.876
<i>The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.</i>

942
00:59:48.086 --> 00:59:50.922
<i>All my work, gone.</i>

943
00:59:51.005 --> 00:59:55.135
<i>I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him.</i>

944
00:59:55.218 --> 00:59:57.512
<i>The man from room 5.</i>

945
00:59:57.595 --> 00:59:58.930
<i>He looked at me.</i>

946
00:59:59.013 --> 01:00:02.517
<i>Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</i>

947
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.186
<i>But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.</i>

948
01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:14.821
<i>Oh, God,</i>

949
01:00:14.904 --> 01:00:16.656
<i>what have I done?</i>

950
01:00:45.894 --> 01:00:48.313
<i>Bonjour</i>, mademoiselle.

951
01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:50.273
What is that you're making?

952
01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:52.984
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

953
01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:54.986
- This is weird.
- What?

954
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:58.615
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

955
01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:01.075
- Really?
- I swear.

956
01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:06.039
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

957
01:01:06.122 --> 01:01:08.082
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

958
01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:10.126
I am V.

959
01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:11.711
At last you know the truth.

960
01:01:12.212 --> 01:01:13.630
You're stunned, I know.

961
01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:17.509
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior,

962
01:01:17.592 --> 01:01:22.805
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

963
01:01:22.889 --> 01:01:24.766
<i>Viva la revoluciÃ³n.</i>

964
01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:26.100
That is not funny, Gordon.

965
01:01:26.184 --> 01:01:28.978
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

966
01:01:29.521 --> 01:01:31.689
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

967
01:01:31.773 --> 01:01:33.775
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

968
01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:37.320
There is something wrong
with this country.

969
01:01:53.336 --> 01:01:54.837
Morning, inspector.

970
01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:58.341
You're at it early.

971
01:01:59.926 --> 01:02:03.638
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

972
01:02:11.854 --> 01:02:14.357
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

973
01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:18.152
I don't care if you answer me or not.

974
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.281
I just wanna say this aloud.

975
01:02:22.532 --> 01:02:26.369
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

976
01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:28.788
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

977
01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:31.291
Because of the terrorist?

978
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.085
No.

979
01:02:35.253 --> 01:02:38.339
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

980
01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:44.679
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's

981
01:02:45.555 --> 01:02:46.931
and Three Waters.

982
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:53.479
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours,

983
01:02:53.688 --> 01:02:56.482
the question I have to ask, is:

984
01:02:57.984 --> 01:03:00.862
What if the worst,

985
01:03:01.571 --> 01:03:05.199
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history

986
01:03:05.283 --> 01:03:09.120
was not the work of religious extremists?

987
01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:12.957
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

988
01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:15.251
And they were executed. I know.

989
01:03:15.335 --> 01:03:18.379
And maybe that's really what happened.

990
01:03:20.715 --> 01:03:23.343
But I see this chain of events...

991
01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:28.306
these coincidences, and I have to ask:

992
01:03:28.389 --> 01:03:30.016
What if that isn't what happened?

993
01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:33.186
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

994
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:37.398
What if someone else
killed all those people?

995
01:03:37.482 --> 01:03:39.859
Would you really wanna know who it was?

996
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.320
Sure.

997
01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:44.781
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

998
01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:48.284
That's my question.

999
01:03:48.743 --> 01:03:51.537
If our own government was responsible

1000
01:03:51.746 --> 01:03:56.000
for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

1001
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.296
if our own government was responsible

1002
01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:04.550
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people,

1003
01:04:07.303 --> 01:04:08.971
would you really wanna know?

1004
01:04:09.347 --> 01:04:11.641
<i>This has to be the bloody
coldest March in years.</i>

1005
01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:14.310
<i>Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.</i>

1006
01:04:14.394 --> 01:04:16.396
<i>They're a pack of lying hypocrites!</i>

1007
01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:18.064
<i>Keep it down, will you?</i>

1008
01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:25.279
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now

1009
01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:28.616
80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

1010
01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:31.577
We're also showing a 12-percent increase

1011
01:04:31.661 --> 01:04:35.248
over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

1012
01:04:35.331 --> 01:04:38.918
<i>- Mr. Creedy?</i>
- We're handling it as best we can.

1013
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.713
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

1014
01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:44.340
<i>I want more than arrests. I want results.</i>

1015
01:04:48.469 --> 01:04:50.805
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

1016
01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:53.099
Celebrating what?

1017
01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:56.352
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

1018
01:04:56.436 --> 01:04:59.313
<i>Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1019
01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:02.692
<i>Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.</i>

1020
01:05:02.984 --> 01:05:06.320
<i>You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</i>

1021
01:05:06.404 --> 01:05:08.990
<i>Will you please give
a very warm welcome</i>

1022
01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:12.577
<i>to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</i>

1023
01:05:16.998 --> 01:05:18.583
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1024
01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:24.046
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1025
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.715
Oh, my God.

1026
01:05:38.227 --> 01:05:40.021
<i>Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor,</i>

1027
01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:43.024
<i>I understand you've been
under tremendous strain lately,</i>

1028
01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:46.360
<i>since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business,</i>

1029
01:05:46.444 --> 01:05:50.615
<i>and we thought it would be a nice idea
to try and help you relax. Girls?</i>

1030
01:05:55.369 --> 01:06:00.041
<i>Ah! Warm milk.
There's nothing better.</i>

1031
01:06:00.124 --> 01:06:03.252
<i>I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.</i>

1032
01:06:03.336 --> 01:06:05.171
<i>Since I was a boy.</i>

1033
01:06:06.255 --> 01:06:07.924
<i>But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</i>

1034
01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:11.844
<i>- The terrorist was never a concern.
- Oh, really?</i>

1035
01:06:11.928 --> 01:06:14.263
<i>- Chancellor, chancellor...</i>
- It's him.

1036
01:06:14.347 --> 01:06:17.642
<i>Are you saying that
he's not still alive and active?</i>

1037
01:06:17.725 --> 01:06:20.478
<i>The terrorist has been neutralized.</i>

1038
01:06:22.063 --> 01:06:24.857
<i>Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!</i>

1039
01:06:24.941 --> 01:06:26.609
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1040
01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:28.694
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1041
01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:32.156
<i>Get him!</i>

1042
01:06:34.575 --> 01:06:36.452
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1043
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.515
<i>At last!</i>

1044
01:06:57.598 --> 01:07:01.561
<i>And now, for all the world to see.</i>

1045
01:07:02.728 --> 01:07:03.980
It's him!

1046
01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:09.193
<i>Unhand me! I am your chancellor!</i>

1047
01:07:09.277 --> 01:07:13.030
<i>How dare you! I am the chancellor!</i>

1048
01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:15.241
<i>Impostor!</i>

1049
01:07:21.706 --> 01:07:24.292
<i>Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!</i>

1050
01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:27.044
<i>- I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar!</i>

1051
01:07:27.128 --> 01:07:28.254
<i>- Faker!
- Fraud!</i>

1052
01:07:28.337 --> 01:07:30.256
<i>- Ready!
- Aim!</i>

1053
01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:31.883
<i>- Fire!
- Fire!</i>

1054
01:07:43.728 --> 01:07:45.813
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1055
01:07:45.897 --> 01:07:49.442
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1056
01:07:49.525 --> 01:07:52.111
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1057
01:07:52.194 --> 01:07:54.155
Protect me.

1058
01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:56.157
I should've hired him to be my mother.

1059
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.076
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1060
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.246
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1061
01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:05.750
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1062
01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:09.003
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1063
01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:14.842
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1064
01:08:21.515 --> 01:08:22.808
Gordon?

1065
01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:27.063
Quick, Evey, hide!

1066
01:08:42.078 --> 01:08:45.373
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1067
01:09:35.798 --> 01:09:37.383
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1068
01:09:50.771 --> 01:09:53.983
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

1069
01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.527
Please.

1070
01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.697
You've been formally charged
with three counts of murder,

1071
01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:03.117
the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism,

1072
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.205
treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1073
01:10:09.415 --> 01:10:14.837
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1074
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.924
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts

1075
01:10:19.133 --> 01:10:21.010
of code name V.

1076
01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:24.305
If your information leads to his capture,

1077
01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:28.267
you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1078
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.020
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1079
01:10:31.103 --> 01:10:34.273
You can return to your life, Miss Hammond.

1080
01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:38.778
All you have to do is cooperate.

1081
01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:44.784
Process her.

1082
01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:53.871
<i>I know there's no way I can convince you</i>

1083
01:12:53.954 --> 01:12:56.832
<i>this is not one of their tricks,
but I don't care.</i>

1084
01:12:56.916 --> 01:12:58.792
<i>I am me.</i>

1085
01:12:58.876 --> 01:13:00.711
<i>My name is Valerie.</i>

1086
01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:05.925
<i>I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life.</i>

1087
01:13:06.008 --> 01:13:10.429
<i>This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God,</i>

1088
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:13.349
<i>I'm writing it on toilet paper.</i>

1089
01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:19.063
<i>I was born in Nottingham in 1985.</i>

1090
01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:21.607
<i>I don't remember much
of those early years</i>

1091
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:24.026
<i>but I do remember the rain.</i>

1092
01:13:24.109 --> 01:13:26.612
<i>My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook</i>

1093
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:29.698
<i>and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain.</i>

1094
01:13:29.782 --> 01:13:32.618
<i>I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar.</i>

1095
01:13:32.826 --> 01:13:35.537
<i>It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.</i>

1096
01:13:35.621 --> 01:13:37.331
<i>Her name was Sarah.</i>

1097
01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:39.500
<i>It was her wrists.</i>

1098
01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:41.335
<i>They were beautiful.</i>

1099
01:13:43.921 --> 01:13:46.215
<i>I thought we would
love each other forever.</i>

1100
01:13:46.924 --> 01:13:49.134
<i>I remember our teacher telling us</i>

1101
01:13:49.218 --> 01:13:52.012
<i>that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.</i>

1102
01:13:52.096 --> 01:13:53.681
<i>Sarah did.</i>

1103
01:13:55.224 --> 01:13:57.059
<i>I didn't.</i>

1104
01:13:57.268 --> 01:14:01.438
<i>In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.</i>

1105
01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:03.107
<i>That year I came out to my parents.</i>

1106
01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:07.653
<i>I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.</i>

1107
01:14:07.736 --> 01:14:11.657
<i>My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.</i>

1108
01:14:13.075 --> 01:14:14.868
<i>My mother said nothing.</i>

1109
01:14:15.703 --> 01:14:19.665
<i>But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?</i>

1110
01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:24.670
<i>Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.</i>

1111
01:14:24.753 --> 01:14:27.006
<i>It is the very last inch of us.</i>

1112
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.758
<i>But within that inch,</i>

1113
01:14:29.842 --> 01:14:31.135
<i>we are free.</i>

1114
01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:35.514
It ends whenever you want it to.

1115
01:14:35.597 --> 01:14:38.225
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1116
01:15:14.803 --> 01:15:17.348
<i>I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life</i>

1117
01:15:17.431 --> 01:15:22.686
<i>and in 2015, I starred in my first film,</i>
The Salt Flats.

1118
01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:27.691
<i>It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career,</i>

1119
01:15:27.775 --> 01:15:29.818
<i>but because that was how I met Ruth.</i>

1120
01:15:32.112 --> 01:15:33.822
<i>The first time we kissed,</i>

1121
01:15:34.448 --> 01:15:38.702
<i>I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.</i>

1122
01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:48.003
<i>We moved to a small flat
in London together.</i>

1123
01:15:48.087 --> 01:15:50.672
<i>She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box</i>

1124
01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:54.468
<i>and our place always smelt of roses.</i>

1125
01:15:56.303 --> 01:15:58.972
<i>Those were the best years of my life.</i>

1126
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:05.104
<i>But America's war grew worse and worse</i>

1127
01:16:05.187 --> 01:16:07.189
<i>and eventually came to London.</i>

1128
01:16:07.272 --> 01:16:10.401
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler

1129
01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:13.487
to close the remaining tube stations
passed with near-universal...

1130
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:16.490
<i>After that, there were no roses anymore.</i>

1131
01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:18.409
<i>Not for anyone.</i>

1132
01:16:18.492 --> 01:16:20.661
You won't last much longer.

1133
01:16:20.744 --> 01:16:22.496
You're gonna die here.

1134
01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:25.707
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1135
01:16:36.552 --> 01:16:39.930
<i>I remember how the meaning
of words began to change.</i>

1136
01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:46.687
<i>How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening,</i>

1137
01:16:47.271 --> 01:16:52.109
<i>while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</i>

1138
01:16:52.526 --> 01:16:56.029
<i>I remember how "different"
became dangerous.</i>

1139
01:16:56.113 --> 01:16:58.699
<i>I still don't understand it,</i>

1140
01:16:58.782 --> 01:17:00.909
<i>why they hate us so much.</i>

1141
01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:09.334
<i>They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.</i>

1142
01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:14.673
<i>I've never cried so hard in my life.</i>

1143
01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:18.427
<i>It wasn't long till they came for me.</i>

1144
01:17:26.226 --> 01:17:30.314
<i>It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.</i>

1145
01:17:30.397 --> 01:17:35.861
<i>But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.</i>

1146
01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:40.324
<i>I shall die here.</i>

1147
01:17:40.407 --> 01:17:44.036
<i>Every inch of me shall perish.</i>

1148
01:17:44.119 --> 01:17:45.871
<i>Every inch</i>

1149
01:17:46.455 --> 01:17:47.706
<i>but one.</i>

1150
01:17:51.877 --> 01:17:53.587
<i>An inch.</i>

1151
01:17:54.296 --> 01:17:56.882
<i>It is small, and it is fragile</i>

1152
01:17:57.090 --> 01:18:00.761
<i>and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.</i>

1153
01:18:00.886 --> 01:18:06.016
<i>We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.</i>

1154
01:18:06.767 --> 01:18:11.188
<i>I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.</i>

1155
01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:14.525
<i>I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.</i>

1156
01:18:16.026 --> 01:18:19.655
<i>But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean</i>

1157
01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:23.033
<i>when I tell you that
even though I do not know you</i>

1158
01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:25.911
<i>and even though
I may never meet you,</i>

1159
01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:29.373
<i>laugh with you, cry with you,</i>

1160
01:18:29.456 --> 01:18:31.416
<i>or kiss you...</i>

1161
01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:33.752
<i>I love you.</i>

1162
01:18:33.835 --> 01:18:36.421
<i>With all my heart,</i>

1163
01:18:36.672 --> 01:18:38.632
<i>I love you.</i>

1164
01:18:40.259 --> 01:18:41.677
<i>Valerie.</i>

1165
01:18:54.398 --> 01:18:56.066
I'm instructed to inform you

1166
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:59.152
that you have been convicted
by special tribunal

1167
01:18:59.236 --> 01:19:02.281
and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation,

1168
01:19:02.364 --> 01:19:04.324
you are to be executed.

1169
01:19:04.408 --> 01:19:08.203
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1170
01:19:09.246 --> 01:19:12.040
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1171
01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:18.171
- No.
- Very well.

1172
01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:22.968
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1173
01:19:24.094 --> 01:19:25.637
Arrange a detail of six men

1174
01:19:25.721 --> 01:19:28.724
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1175
01:19:44.698 --> 01:19:45.991
It's time.

1176
01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:49.077
I'm ready.

1177
01:19:50.787 --> 01:19:53.624
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1178
01:19:53.707 --> 01:19:55.959
Just give them something, anything.

1179
01:19:56.877 --> 01:19:58.378
Thank you,

1180
01:19:58.462 --> 01:20:01.506
but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1181
01:20:01.715 --> 01:20:06.053
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1182
01:20:12.059 --> 01:20:13.310
What?

1183
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:39.062
Hello, Evey.

1184
01:21:40.605 --> 01:21:41.898
You.

1185
01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:46.903
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1186
01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.989
That wasn't real?

1187
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:55.495
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1188
01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.080
I thought they'd arrest him

1189
01:21:57.164 --> 01:22:00.459
but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1190
01:22:01.126 --> 01:22:02.627
Oh, God.

1191
01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:06.882
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?

1192
01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.469
You did this to me?

1193
01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:13.472
You cut my hair?

1194
01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.433
You tortured me?

1195
01:22:17.267 --> 01:22:19.102
You tortured me.

1196
01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:21.855
Why?

1197
01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:27.527
You said you wanted to live without
fear. I wish there'd been an easier way

1198
01:22:27.611 --> 01:22:29.738
- but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

1199
01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:31.782
I know you may never forgive me

1200
01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:35.035
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1201
01:22:35.118 --> 01:22:38.246
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1202
01:22:38.663 --> 01:22:40.874
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1203
01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:44.628
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1204
01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:47.506
You're sick! You're evil!

1205
01:22:48.131 --> 01:22:51.134
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1206
01:22:51.885 --> 01:22:54.262
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1207
01:22:54.471 --> 01:22:58.058
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1208
01:22:58.141 --> 01:23:00.769
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me,

1209
01:23:00.852 --> 01:23:03.438
taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1210
01:23:03.522 --> 01:23:07.192
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1211
01:23:07.275 --> 01:23:09.277
But then something happened.

1212
01:23:09.361 --> 01:23:11.863
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1213
01:23:11.947 --> 01:23:14.908
Shut up! I don't want to hear
your lies!

1214
01:23:14.991 --> 01:23:18.829
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1215
01:23:18.912 --> 01:23:20.705
Yes, I created a lie.

1216
01:23:20.914 --> 01:23:24.668
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1217
01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:28.088
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1218
01:23:28.171 --> 01:23:31.341
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1219
01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:34.094
I can't feel anything anymore!

1220
01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:37.430
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1221
01:23:39.099 --> 01:23:40.934
I can't. Can't breathe.

1222
01:23:41.476 --> 01:23:45.814
Asthma. When I was little...

1223
01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:49.484
Listen to me, Evey.

1224
01:23:50.151 --> 01:23:53.321
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1225
01:23:55.282 --> 01:23:59.744
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1226
01:23:59.828 --> 01:24:02.706
They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take,

1227
01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:04.958
except your life.

1228
01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:08.003
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1229
01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:10.922
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1230
01:24:11.006 --> 01:24:14.759
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1231
01:24:14.843 --> 01:24:18.763
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1232
01:24:18.847 --> 01:24:22.225
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave them what they wanted,

1233
01:24:23.143 --> 01:24:25.270
you told them you'd rather die.

1234
01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:27.355
You faced your death, Evey.

1235
01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:30.525
You were calm. You were still.

1236
01:24:30.609 --> 01:24:33.069
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1237
01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:41.202
Oh, God.

1238
01:24:43.705 --> 01:24:45.040
I felt.

1239
01:24:45.707 --> 01:24:47.125
Yes?

1240
01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:50.962
I'm dizzy.

1241
01:24:51.046 --> 01:24:53.214
I need air.

1242
01:24:53.298 --> 01:24:56.635
Please, I need to be outside.

1243
01:24:56.718 --> 01:24:58.803
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1244
01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:18.865
God is in the rain.

1245
01:26:23.638 --> 01:26:25.098
V.

1246
01:26:26.099 --> 01:26:27.600
I'm leaving.

1247
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.606
There are 872 songs in here.

1248
01:26:34.482 --> 01:26:37.694
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1249
01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:40.989
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1250
01:26:41.072 --> 01:26:42.615
I can't stay here.

1251
01:26:44.117 --> 01:26:45.660
I know.

1252
01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:50.373
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1253
01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:53.543
I thought about keeping this

1254
01:26:53.626 --> 01:26:57.172
but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1255
01:27:03.178 --> 01:27:04.637
I didn't.

1256
01:27:06.765 --> 01:27:08.850
May I show you something before you go?

1257
01:27:19.652 --> 01:27:22.238
- She was real.
- Yes.

1258
01:27:22.322 --> 01:27:24.157
She's beautiful.

1259
01:27:25.241 --> 01:27:27.410
- Did you know her?
- No.

1260
01:27:27.786 --> 01:27:30.288
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1261
01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:33.291
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1262
01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:35.376
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1263
01:27:36.086 --> 01:27:38.671
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1264
01:27:41.257 --> 01:27:43.843
And that's what this is all about.

1265
01:27:43.927 --> 01:27:47.097
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1266
01:27:47.722 --> 01:27:50.975
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1267
01:27:51.059 --> 01:27:53.061
It's a basic principle of the universe

1268
01:27:53.144 --> 01:27:56.189
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1269
01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:57.732
Is that how you see it?

1270
01:27:57.816 --> 01:28:00.360
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1271
01:28:00.485 --> 01:28:02.612
And they created a monster.

1272
01:28:13.206 --> 01:28:16.251
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1273
01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:18.920
That would have scared me before

1274
01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:21.881
but I suppose I should thank you.

1275
01:28:22.215 --> 01:28:23.800
Well.

1276
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:35.019
Thank you.

1277
01:28:37.522 --> 01:28:39.149
Goodbye.

1278
01:28:41.317 --> 01:28:43.027
Evey...

1279
01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:47.031
may I ask you for something?

1280
01:28:47.115 --> 01:28:51.953
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once

1281
01:28:52.162 --> 01:28:53.872
before the 5th.

1282
01:28:56.291 --> 01:28:58.751
- All right.
- Thank you.

1283
01:29:20.982 --> 01:29:23.776
Chancellor, I know no one
seems to want to discuss this

1284
01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.362
but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality,

1285
01:29:26.446 --> 01:29:29.449
then it can't be ignored any longer.

1286
01:29:29.532 --> 01:29:34.078
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1287
01:29:34.162 --> 01:29:35.747
Now, it concludes that

1288
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:38.750
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use

1289
01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:41.878
would be an airborne attack.

1290
01:29:41.961 --> 01:29:43.671
A separate report has been filed

1291
01:29:43.755 --> 01:29:47.675
suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament

1292
01:29:47.759 --> 01:29:49.427
have been sealed shut.

1293
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:51.512
<i>Who filed that report?</i>

1294
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.307
Chief Inspector Finch.

1295
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:57.393
<i>Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</i>

1296
01:29:57.477 --> 01:30:00.104
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1297
01:30:00.188 --> 01:30:02.232
<i>If I am sure of anything, inspector,</i>

1298
01:30:02.315 --> 01:30:06.569
<i>it is that this government won't survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.</i>

1299
01:30:06.653 --> 01:30:09.739
<i>Mr. Dascomb, what we need right now</i>

1300
01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:12.909
<i>is a clear message
to the people of this country.</i>

1301
01:30:12.992 --> 01:30:15.411
<i>This message must be read
in every newspaper,</i>

1302
01:30:15.495 --> 01:30:18.122
<i>heard on every radio,
seen on every television.</i>

1303
01:30:18.206 --> 01:30:22.335
<i>This message must resound
throughout the entire InterLink!</i>

1304
01:30:22.418 --> 01:30:26.005
<i>I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.</i>

1305
01:30:26.089 --> 01:30:30.343
<i>I want every man, woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos.</i>

1306
01:30:30.426 --> 01:30:32.470
<i>I want everyone</i>

1307
01:30:32.553 --> 01:30:36.349
<i>to remember why they need us!</i>

1308
01:30:36.432 --> 01:30:41.062
<i>In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.</i>

1309
01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:45.525
<i>Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.</i>

1310
01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:48.861
<i>Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.</i>

1311
01:30:48.945 --> 01:30:50.947
<i>Police have arrested nine suspects.</i>

1312
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:54.909
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1313
01:30:54.993 --> 01:30:59.038
<i>Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.</i>

1314
01:30:59.497 --> 01:31:03.543
<i>Authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called V</i>

1315
01:31:04.002 --> 01:31:07.964
<i>to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago.</i>

1316
01:31:19.934 --> 01:31:22.562
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1317
01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:24.605
There were three men.

1318
01:31:24.689 --> 01:31:26.566
Covert intel.

1319
01:31:26.649 --> 01:31:29.027
Original black-baggers,
all under Creedy.

1320
01:31:30.028 --> 01:31:33.906
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1321
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:36.159
The day after the St. Mary's outbreak,

1322
01:31:36.242 --> 01:31:39.704
Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1323
01:31:39.787 --> 01:31:41.414
Rookwood goes missing.

1324
01:31:41.497 --> 01:31:44.500
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1325
01:31:44.584 --> 01:31:46.419
Rookwood.

1326
01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:48.421
How do I know that name?

1327
01:31:53.509 --> 01:31:58.681
Holy shit. He must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the Finger.

1328
01:31:58.765 --> 01:32:00.433
But how'd he know it was you?

1329
01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:04.187
What do we do?

1330
01:32:05.438 --> 01:32:08.149
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1331
01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:19.994
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1332
01:32:21.662 --> 01:32:23.289
Still does.

1333
01:32:33.508 --> 01:32:35.551
That's close enough, inspector.

1334
01:32:37.053 --> 01:32:38.346
We're not wired.

1335
01:32:39.389 --> 01:32:42.934
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1336
01:32:43.017 --> 01:32:46.354
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1337
01:32:46.437 --> 01:32:48.606
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1338
01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:51.234
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1339
01:32:51.317 --> 01:32:53.361
A story can be true or false.

1340
01:32:54.028 --> 01:32:57.073
I leave such judgments to you,
inspector.

1341
01:32:57.907 --> 01:33:01.369
Our story begins,
as these stories often do,

1342
01:33:01.452 --> 01:33:04.664
with a young, up-and-coming politician.

1343
01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:08.793
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1344
01:33:09.001 --> 01:33:13.381
<i>He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.</i>

1345
01:33:13.464 --> 01:33:16.717
<i>The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry</i>

1346
01:33:16.801 --> 01:33:19.429
<i>and the more aggressive
his supporters become.</i>

1347
01:33:20.304 --> 01:33:25.518
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.</i>

1348
01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:29.021
<i>At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons</i>

1349
01:33:29.105 --> 01:33:31.983
<i>and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.</i>

1350
01:33:32.066 --> 01:33:35.903
<i>However, the true goal
of this project is power.</i>

1351
01:33:35.987 --> 01:33:38.823
<i>Complete and total hegemonic domination.</i>

1352
01:33:38.906 --> 01:33:41.534
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

1353
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:45.538
<i>But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain</i>

1354
01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:50.751
<i>for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.</i>

1355
01:33:50.835 --> 01:33:54.505
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can

1356
01:33:54.589 --> 01:33:57.717
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1357
01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.805
<i>But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?</i>

1358
01:34:02.889 --> 01:34:06.601
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1359
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:09.228
<i>A man seemingly without a conscience</i>

1360
01:34:09.312 --> 01:34:11.689
<i>for whom the ends
always justify the means.</i>

1361
01:34:11.772 --> 01:34:15.443
<i>And it's he who suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country,</i>

1362
01:34:15.526 --> 01:34:17.487
<i>but rather, the country itself.</i>

1363
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.990
<i>Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:</i>

1364
01:34:21.073 --> 01:34:24.076
<i>A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.</i>

1365
01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.829
<i>Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.</i>

1366
01:34:26.913 --> 01:34:29.373
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1367
01:34:29.457 --> 01:34:32.168
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1368
01:34:32.251 --> 01:34:34.371
...sent a wave of destruction
through the Underground.

1369
01:34:35.087 --> 01:34:38.382
<i>Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly,</i>

1370
01:34:38.466 --> 01:34:41.636
<i>fracturing and dividing
the country until, at last,</i>

1371
01:34:41.761 --> 01:34:43.804
<i>the true goal comes into view.</i>

1372
01:34:43.888 --> 01:34:45.556
Before the St. Mary's crises,

1373
01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.769
no one would've predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1374
01:34:49.852 --> 01:34:54.398
<i>And then not long after the election,
Io and behold, a miracle.</i>

1375
01:34:54.482 --> 01:34:57.109
<i>Some believed it was the work
of God himself.</i>

1376
01:34:57.193 --> 01:35:01.030
<i>But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members</i>

1377
01:35:01.113 --> 01:35:04.492
<i>that made them all obscenely rich.</i>

1378
01:35:04.575 --> 01:35:08.871
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed,

1379
01:35:08.955 --> 01:35:12.208
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1380
01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:18.047
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1381
01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:20.550
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1382
01:35:20.633 --> 01:35:23.344
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed

1383
01:35:23.427 --> 01:35:27.431
to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1384
01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.226
The rest, as they say, is history.

1385
01:35:32.186 --> 01:35:36.274
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1386
01:35:38.859 --> 01:35:42.822
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1387
01:35:42.905 --> 01:35:44.865
I'm sure you would.

1388
01:35:44.949 --> 01:35:49.954
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1389
01:35:50.037 --> 01:35:53.082
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1390
01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:56.127
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing,

1391
01:35:56.210 --> 01:35:57.753
I'll contact you again.

1392
01:35:57.837 --> 01:36:00.172
Till then, cheerio.

1393
01:36:01.799 --> 01:36:03.175
Rookwood...

1394
01:36:04.802 --> 01:36:06.679
why didn't you come forward before?

1395
01:36:07.722 --> 01:36:09.140
What were you waiting for?

1396
01:36:09.223 --> 01:36:11.475
Well, for you, inspector.

1397
01:36:11.684 --> 01:36:13.436
I needed you.

1398
01:36:34.373 --> 01:36:36.500
Shh, shh, shh.

1399
01:36:40.713 --> 01:36:42.840
What's he doing in the dark there?

1400
01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:45.551
Creepy Creedy.
Not sure I wanna know.

1401
01:36:45.635 --> 01:36:49.305
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1402
01:36:49.388 --> 01:36:51.599
And we both know why.

1403
01:36:52.266 --> 01:36:54.685
After I destroy Parliament,

1404
01:36:54.769 --> 01:36:58.731
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1405
01:36:58.814 --> 01:37:00.107
And who will that be?

1406
01:37:00.358 --> 01:37:02.526
You, Mr. Creedy.

1407
01:37:02.735 --> 01:37:06.238
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1408
01:37:06.322 --> 01:37:10.201
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1409
01:37:10.284 --> 01:37:13.537
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1410
01:37:13.621 --> 01:37:16.207
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now,

1411
01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:19.168
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house

1412
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:21.921
- and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.

1413
01:37:22.004 --> 01:37:26.509
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1414
01:37:26.592 --> 01:37:29.637
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1415
01:37:31.263 --> 01:37:33.849
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1416
01:37:33.933 --> 01:37:36.018
You knew that one day, it'd be you or him.

1417
01:37:36.102 --> 01:37:39.522
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1418
01:37:39.605 --> 01:37:42.858
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler,

1419
01:37:42.942 --> 01:37:46.821
men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1420
01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:49.865
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1421
01:37:51.701 --> 01:37:54.870
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1422
01:37:56.997 --> 01:37:58.958
Why should I trust you?

1423
01:37:59.083 --> 01:38:02.294
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1424
01:38:10.177 --> 01:38:13.723
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</i>

1425
01:38:15.516 --> 01:38:16.934
<i>May we come up?</i>

1426
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:20.521
<i>You find your own tree.</i>

1427
01:38:31.615 --> 01:38:34.493
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1428
01:38:35.119 --> 01:38:37.538
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1429
01:38:40.624 --> 01:38:43.127
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1430
01:38:45.755 --> 01:38:47.882
- Yeah.
<i>- Is that Chief Inspector Finch?</i>

1431
01:38:47.965 --> 01:38:49.842
- It is.
<i>- This is Captain Clark</i>

1432
01:38:49.925 --> 01:38:52.011
<i>of the 137th Ward at Southend.</i>

1433
01:38:52.094 --> 01:38:53.387
<i>- We found him.</i>
- Found who?

1434
01:38:53.471 --> 01:38:55.639
<i>William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.</i>

1435
01:38:55.723 --> 01:38:59.602
<i>I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.</i>

1436
01:38:59.685 --> 01:39:01.687
<i>I hooked him. Perfect dental match.</i>

1437
01:39:01.771 --> 01:39:05.775
<i>A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.</i>

1438
01:39:05.858 --> 01:39:09.737
- William Rookwood is dead?
<i>- I'd say so. Twenty years now.</i>

1439
01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:14.492
Goddamn it!

1440
01:39:14.784 --> 01:39:17.119
That son of a bitch sat there

1441
01:39:17.203 --> 01:39:20.998
and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1442
01:39:21.874 --> 01:39:23.834
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1443
01:39:23.918 --> 01:39:26.378
We do what we should
have been doing.

1444
01:39:27.087 --> 01:39:28.422
We find him.

1445
01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:53.072
<i>Every day, gentlemen.</i>

1446
01:39:53.155 --> 01:39:57.284
<i>Every day that brings us closer
to November,</i>

1447
01:39:57.368 --> 01:40:00.162
<i>every day that man remains free</i>

1448
01:40:00.538 --> 01:40:03.082
<i>is one more failure.</i>

1449
01:40:03.165 --> 01:40:05.668
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.</i>

1450
01:40:05.751 --> 01:40:08.337
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven failures!</i>

1451
01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:11.131
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

1452
01:40:11.215 --> 01:40:14.218
<i>We are being buried beneath the avalanche</i>

1453
01:40:14.343 --> 01:40:17.429
<i>of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!</i>

1454
01:40:34.738 --> 01:40:35.990
I'll get it.

1455
01:40:37.283 --> 01:40:39.660
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1456
01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:45.708
Bloody hell.

1457
01:40:47.251 --> 01:40:49.628
How many went out?

1458
01:40:49.712 --> 01:40:51.213
So far we count eight boxcars.

1459
01:40:51.297 --> 01:40:54.008
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1460
01:40:55.509 --> 01:40:59.638
<i>I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!</i>

1461
01:40:59.722 --> 01:41:02.600
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1462
01:41:02.683 --> 01:41:05.769
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1463
01:41:06.478 --> 01:41:08.898
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1464
01:41:08.981 --> 01:41:12.776
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1465
01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:18.198
<i>Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.</i>

1466
01:41:20.534 --> 01:41:24.997
<i>The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.</i>

1467
01:41:26.707 --> 01:41:29.919
That's why I went to Larkhill last night.

1468
01:41:30.002 --> 01:41:33.547
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1469
01:41:35.132 --> 01:41:36.800
<i>There wasn't much left.</i>

1470
01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.971
<i>But when I was there, it was strange.</i>

1471
01:41:41.055 --> 01:41:44.808
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1472
01:41:50.397 --> 01:41:52.107
Like I could see the whole thing.

1473
01:41:52.399 --> 01:41:57.279
<i>One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.</i>

1474
01:41:59.281 --> 01:42:02.701
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1475
01:42:08.791 --> 01:42:10.751
and everything that was going to happen.

1476
01:42:11.377 --> 01:42:12.962
Hey, you!

1477
01:42:15.047 --> 01:42:19.301
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1478
01:42:20.594 --> 01:42:23.180
and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1479
01:42:27.726 --> 01:42:29.603
and all trapped by it.

1480
01:42:36.902 --> 01:42:38.779
So do you know what's gonna happen?

1481
01:42:39.571 --> 01:42:42.658
No. It was a feeling.

1482
01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.286
But I can guess.

1483
01:42:48.247 --> 01:42:51.834
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1484
01:42:56.088 --> 01:42:57.715
<i>And when they do,</i>

1485
01:42:57.798 --> 01:42:59.842
things will turn nasty.

1486
01:43:14.398 --> 01:43:16.191
<i>Rioters were arrested in Brixton.</i>

1487
01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:20.821
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1488
01:43:23.907 --> 01:43:29.329
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1489
01:43:30.497 --> 01:43:31.915
And then.

1490
01:44:36.313 --> 01:44:38.732
Tonight's your big night.

1491
01:44:39.733 --> 01:44:41.443
You ready for it?

1492
01:44:43.695 --> 01:44:45.823
Are we ready for it?

1493
01:45:19.064 --> 01:45:20.774
I missed this song.

1494
01:45:21.608 --> 01:45:23.735
I didn't think you'd come.

1495
01:45:24.736 --> 01:45:27.573
- I said I would.
- Ah.

1496
01:45:30.117 --> 01:45:31.743
You look well.

1497
01:45:31.827 --> 01:45:33.328
Thank you.

1498
01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:39.543
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1499
01:45:39.626 --> 01:45:42.671
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1500
01:45:44.256 --> 01:45:48.218
I must confess, every time
I heard a siren, I worried about you.

1501
01:45:48.302 --> 01:45:51.180
I worried about myself for a while.

1502
01:45:51.805 --> 01:45:54.641
But then, one day, I was at a market

1503
01:45:54.725 --> 01:45:58.854
and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1504
01:46:00.022 --> 01:46:04.193
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1505
01:46:05.444 --> 01:46:07.863
My friend picked it up

1506
01:46:07.946 --> 01:46:09.781
and handed it to me.

1507
01:46:10.782 --> 01:46:13.118
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1508
01:46:14.119 --> 01:46:15.996
didn't recognize me.

1509
01:46:18.332 --> 01:46:21.460
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1510
01:46:27.382 --> 01:46:29.968
I have a gift for you, Evey.

1511
01:46:30.052 --> 01:46:35.098
But before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1512
01:46:35.307 --> 01:46:38.268
Would you dance with me?

1513
01:46:39.311 --> 01:46:42.814
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1514
01:46:42.898 --> 01:46:46.526
Oh, a revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1515
01:46:48.153 --> 01:46:49.363
I'd love to.

1516
01:46:50.697 --> 01:46:53.909
<i>Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people</i>

1517
01:46:53.992 --> 01:46:56.536
<i>and make the situation
perfectly clear to them.</i>

1518
01:46:56.620 --> 01:47:02.251
<i>The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.</i>

1519
01:47:02.334 --> 01:47:06.964
<i>Tonight, any protester,
any instigator or agitator</i>

1520
01:47:07.047 --> 01:47:09.341
<i>will be made example of!</i>

1521
01:47:12.094 --> 01:47:15.097
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1522
01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.099
<i>And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?</i>

1523
01:47:17.182 --> 01:47:19.476
- Should the terrorist succeed...
<i>- He won't.</i>

1524
01:47:19.559 --> 01:47:23.188
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

1525
01:47:23.272 --> 01:47:27.109
<i>If he does, and something happens
to that building,</i>

1526
01:47:27.192 --> 01:47:30.529
<i>the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make</i>

1527
01:47:30.612 --> 01:47:33.448
<i>is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper,</i>

1528
01:47:33.532 --> 01:47:37.452
<i>I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation!</i>

1529
01:47:42.249 --> 01:47:46.461
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1530
01:47:46.545 --> 01:47:50.007
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1531
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:52.551
Hmm, it's nearly time.

1532
01:47:52.634 --> 01:47:55.387
The masks were ingenious.

1533
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:58.390
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1534
01:47:58.515 --> 01:48:01.685
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid

1535
01:48:01.768 --> 01:48:05.314
for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent.

1536
01:48:05.397 --> 01:48:08.191
- <i>Twelfth Night.</i>
- Viola.

1537
01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:11.153
- I don't understand.
- What?

1538
01:48:11.236 --> 01:48:14.740
How you can be one of the most
important things that's happened to me

1539
01:48:14.823 --> 01:48:17.326
and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1540
01:48:17.409 --> 01:48:20.287
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were,

1541
01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:22.914
if you had any brothers or sisters.

1542
01:48:22.998 --> 01:48:26.209
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1543
01:48:26.293 --> 01:48:28.003
Evey, please.

1544
01:48:29.588 --> 01:48:31.840
There is a face beneath this mask,

1545
01:48:31.923 --> 01:48:33.842
but it's not me.

1546
01:48:33.925 --> 01:48:37.387
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it

1547
01:48:37.471 --> 01:48:39.181
or the bones beneath them.

1548
01:48:41.433 --> 01:48:42.642
I understand.

1549
01:48:43.852 --> 01:48:45.437
Thank you.

1550
01:48:46.188 --> 01:48:47.981
There isn't much time.

1551
01:48:48.065 --> 01:48:50.275
I have something I must give you.

1552
01:48:50.734 --> 01:48:52.694
I went by Parliament.

1553
01:48:52.778 --> 01:48:57.657
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1554
01:48:58.533 --> 01:49:01.453
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1555
01:49:03.455 --> 01:49:06.083
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1556
01:49:06.833 --> 01:49:09.461
What usually happens
when people without guns

1557
01:49:09.544 --> 01:49:11.880
stand up to people with guns.

1558
01:49:13.548 --> 01:49:14.633
Pull over here.

1559
01:49:14.716 --> 01:49:18.261
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1560
01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.058
Inspector.

1561
01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:25.727
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1562
01:49:34.528 --> 01:49:38.365
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1563
01:49:38.448 --> 01:49:39.783
They did.

1564
01:49:39.866 --> 01:49:43.703
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.

1565
01:49:45.664 --> 01:49:47.207
Let me show you.

1566
01:50:03.348 --> 01:50:06.935
- These tracks lead to Parliament.
- Yes.

1567
01:50:07.644 --> 01:50:09.688
Then it's really going to happen,
isn't it?

1568
01:50:09.771 --> 01:50:13.150
It will if you want it to.

1569
01:50:13.608 --> 01:50:15.777
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1570
01:50:16.319 --> 01:50:21.825
Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train,

1571
01:50:21.908 --> 01:50:24.953
I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1572
01:50:25.036 --> 01:50:26.538
Is this another trick, V?

1573
01:50:26.621 --> 01:50:31.042
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1574
01:50:31.126 --> 01:50:33.128
Only truth.

1575
01:50:33.211 --> 01:50:36.465
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong,

1576
01:50:36.923 --> 01:50:41.845
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1577
01:50:42.053 --> 01:50:44.848
- Why?
- Because this world,

1578
01:50:44.931 --> 01:50:49.478
the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1579
01:50:50.479 --> 01:50:52.564
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin

1580
01:50:52.647 --> 01:50:57.777
that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1581
01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:02.616
Where are you going?

1582
01:51:02.908 --> 01:51:05.327
The time has come for me
to meet my maker

1583
01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:08.830
and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1584
01:51:08.914 --> 01:51:11.791
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1585
01:51:11.875 --> 01:51:14.503
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1586
01:51:14.586 --> 01:51:17.589
No. You were right about what I am.

1587
01:51:18.089 --> 01:51:20.091
I have no tree waiting for me.

1588
01:51:20.509 --> 01:51:25.055
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1589
01:51:25.138 --> 01:51:26.932
That's not true.

1590
01:51:53.542 --> 01:51:54.918
I can't.

1591
01:52:04.094 --> 01:52:05.637
<i>My fellow Englishmen...</i>

1592
01:52:06.179 --> 01:52:08.223
<i>tonight, our country,</i>

1593
01:52:08.306 --> 01:52:09.933
<i>that which we stand for</i>

1594
01:52:10.016 --> 01:52:11.726
<i>and all that we hold dear,</i>

1595
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:15.689
<i>faces a grave and terrible threat.</i>

1596
01:52:15.772 --> 01:52:17.274
The area's clean, sir.

1597
01:52:17.816 --> 01:52:21.695
<i>This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security</i>

1598
01:52:21.778 --> 01:52:23.613
<i>will not go undefended...</i>

1599
01:52:23.697 --> 01:52:25.073
Where is he?

1600
01:52:25.156 --> 01:52:26.241
<i>...or unpunished.</i>

1601
01:52:26.324 --> 01:52:28.577
Penny for the Guy.

1602
01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:32.706
<i>Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us</i>

1603
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:37.794
<i>and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.</i>

1604
01:52:37.877 --> 01:52:42.048
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1605
01:52:42.132 --> 01:52:43.383
Bring him down.

1606
01:52:43.466 --> 01:52:45.760
<i>Tonight we must remain steadfast.</i>

1607
01:52:46.219 --> 01:52:48.096
<i>We must remain determined.</i>

1608
01:52:48.179 --> 01:52:51.474
<i>But most of all, we must remain united.</i>

1609
01:52:54.728 --> 01:52:58.356
<i>Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew</i>

1610
01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:01.192
<i>will be considered in league
with our enemy</i>

1611
01:53:01.276 --> 01:53:04.613
<i>and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.</i>

1612
01:53:04.696 --> 01:53:06.281
I want to see his face.

1613
01:53:06.364 --> 01:53:09.909
<i>Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow</i>

1614
01:53:09.993 --> 01:53:12.495
<i>thatjustice will be swift,</i>

1615
01:53:12.579 --> 01:53:15.123
<i>it will be righteous,</i>

1616
01:53:15.206 --> 01:53:17.584
<i>and it will be without mercy.</i>

1617
01:53:19.711 --> 01:53:21.880
Oh, God. No.

1618
01:53:21.963 --> 01:53:25.967
At last, we finally meet.

1619
01:53:28.428 --> 01:53:30.847
I have something for you, chancellor.

1620
01:53:31.097 --> 01:53:32.932
A farewell gift.

1621
01:53:33.016 --> 01:53:36.728
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done,

1622
01:53:36.811 --> 01:53:38.855
and for the only thing you have left.

1623
01:53:41.232 --> 01:53:43.151
Goodbye, chancellor.

1624
01:53:44.152 --> 01:53:45.362
Mr. Creedy.

1625
01:53:47.697 --> 01:53:49.616
Disgusting.

1626
01:54:02.253 --> 01:54:04.422
Now that's done with,

1627
01:54:04.506 --> 01:54:08.385
it's time to have a look at your face.

1628
01:54:08.927 --> 01:54:10.470
Take off your mask.

1629
01:54:10.762 --> 01:54:12.013
No.

1630
01:54:27.404 --> 01:54:29.072
Defiant to the end, huh?

1631
01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:34.661
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1632
01:54:34.744 --> 01:54:35.995
You're like me.

1633
01:54:36.079 --> 01:54:38.790
The only thing you and I
have in common, Mr. Creedy,

1634
01:54:38.873 --> 01:54:40.583
is we're both about to die.

1635
01:54:42.168 --> 01:54:44.003
How do you imagine that's gonna happen?

1636
01:54:44.087 --> 01:54:46.464
With my hands around your neck.

1637
01:54:48.675 --> 01:54:49.884
Bollocks.

1638
01:54:50.927 --> 01:54:53.179
What are you gonna do, huh?

1639
01:54:53.263 --> 01:54:55.473
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1640
01:54:55.557 --> 01:55:00.019
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1641
01:55:00.103 --> 01:55:01.771
We have guns.

1642
01:55:01.855 --> 01:55:05.191
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty,

1643
01:55:05.275 --> 01:55:07.444
I'm no longer standing, because if I am,

1644
01:55:08.319 --> 01:55:10.405
you'll all be dead before you've reloaded.

1645
01:55:10.739 --> 01:55:12.907
That's impossible!

1646
01:55:15.326 --> 01:55:16.369
Kill him.

1647
01:55:41.019 --> 01:55:42.145
My turn.

1648
01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:56.010
Die! Die!

1649
01:56:56.928 --> 01:56:59.055
Why won't you die?

1650
01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:01.432
Why won't you die?

1651
01:57:03.226 --> 01:57:06.396
Beneath this mask,
there is more than flesh.

1652
01:57:06.479 --> 01:57:09.399
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1653
01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:12.944
And ideas are bulletproof.

1654
01:58:04.579 --> 01:58:07.749
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1655
01:58:07.832 --> 01:58:09.208
This is General Ackroyd.

1656
01:58:09.542 --> 01:58:11.169
Keep communication tight.

1657
01:58:11.252 --> 01:58:14.589
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1658
01:58:18.509 --> 01:58:19.844
V!

1659
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:27.018
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1660
01:58:27.101 --> 01:58:31.314
Please, don't.
I'm finished and glad of it.

1661
01:58:31.648 --> 01:58:33.274
Don't say that.

1662
01:58:33.775 --> 01:58:36.694
I told you, only truth.

1663
01:58:40.156 --> 01:58:43.660
For 20 years, I sought only this day.

1664
01:58:43.743 --> 01:58:45.912
Nothing else existed...

1665
01:58:48.039 --> 01:58:50.041
until I saw you.

1666
01:58:51.167 --> 01:58:53.419
Then everything changed.

1667
01:58:54.837 --> 01:58:56.756
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1668
01:58:58.341 --> 01:59:01.552
like I no longer believed I could.

1669
01:59:01.636 --> 01:59:04.180
V, I don't want you to die.

1670
01:59:06.933 --> 01:59:10.728
That's the most beautiful thing

1671
01:59:10.812 --> 01:59:13.481
you could have ever given me.

1672
01:59:21.072 --> 01:59:22.490
V?

1673
01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:24.993
V?

1674
01:59:35.712 --> 01:59:38.473
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading towards Trafalgar Square.

1675
01:59:38.548 --> 01:59:40.633
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1676
02:00:12.832 --> 02:00:14.917
Hold it. Stop right there.

1677
02:00:18.337 --> 02:00:19.881
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1678
02:00:27.847 --> 02:00:29.182
Then it's over?

1679
02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:30.850
Almost.

1680
02:00:30.933 --> 02:00:33.478
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1681
02:00:35.772 --> 02:00:36.939
No.

1682
02:00:37.648 --> 02:00:40.068
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1683
02:00:40.151 --> 02:00:42.487
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1684
02:00:43.821 --> 02:00:45.740
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1685
02:00:46.324 --> 02:00:47.700
Or from the high chancellor.

1686
02:00:48.576 --> 02:00:49.869
Why are you doing this?

1687
02:00:50.328 --> 02:00:52.747
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1688
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:57.418
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1689
02:01:02.381 --> 02:01:04.967
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1690
02:01:31.702 --> 02:01:34.163
Jesus bloody Christ.

1691
02:01:59.397 --> 02:02:00.565
It's time.

1692
02:02:21.878 --> 02:02:23.254
Tell me...

1693
02:02:24.255 --> 02:02:26.757
do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1694
02:02:46.319 --> 02:02:48.321
That music?

1695
02:02:48.821 --> 02:02:50.281
Yes.

1696
02:02:50.698 --> 02:02:52.325
His music.

1697
02:03:24.190 --> 02:03:25.816
Who was he?

1698
02:03:27.026 --> 02:03:28.319
He was Edmond Dantes.

1699
02:03:30.446 --> 02:03:32.865
And he was my father

1700
02:03:32.949 --> 02:03:34.951
and my mother.

1701
02:03:35.826 --> 02:03:37.328
My brother.

1702
02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:41.123
My friend.

1703
02:03:42.083 --> 02:03:43.668
He was you...

1704
02:03:46.128 --> 02:03:47.546
and me.

1705
02:03:49.715 --> 02:03:51.634
He was all of us.

1706
02:04:21.038 --> 02:04:23.541
<i>No one will ever forget that night</i>

1707
02:04:23.624 --> 02:04:26.085
<i>and what it meant for this country.</i>

1708
02:04:26.877 --> 02:04:29.297
<i>But I will never forget the man</i>

1709
02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:31.132
<i>and what he meant to me.</i>
