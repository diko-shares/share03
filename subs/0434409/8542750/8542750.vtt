He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.

The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...

...and the more aggressive
his supporters become.

Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.

At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons...

found guilty and executed...

the true genius of the plan, was the fear.
