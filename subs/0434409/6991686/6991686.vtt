Yes.

Yes, the strings.

Listen carefully, can you hear it?

169
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.115
Now the brass.

00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:21.034

The Bailey area is quarantined.

179

All significant witnesses
have been detained.

A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

182
00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:19.008
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's

Yes, sir.

185
00:11:23.096 --> 00:11:26.933
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance

186
00:11:27.016 --> 00:11:30.686
indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.

187
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.772
<i>Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?</i>

188

We're calling it

189
00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:38.569
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

190
00:11:38.653 --> 00:11:42.949
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

191
00:11:43.032 --> 00:11:46.077
<i>I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings</i>

192

<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

196
00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:01.634
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist

197
00:12:01.717 --> 00:12:05.179
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

198
00:12:05.263 --> 00:12:10.476
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

199
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.979
<i>- Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Not sure yet, sir.

200
00:12:13.062 --> 00:12:15.690
- But we're working on several leads.
<i>- Anything else?</i>

201
00:12:15.773 --> 00:12:17.650
We located the fireworks launch

202
00:12:17.733 --> 00:12:20.695
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

203
00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:26.117
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication

204
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.996
these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals

205
00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:32.623
making them very difficult to trace.

342

Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

643
00:39:21.773 --> 00:39:24.692
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

644
00:39:24.776 --> 00:39:28.696
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

645
00:39:29.072 --> 00:39:33.242
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

646
00:39:33.326 --> 00:39:38.748
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

647
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:42.293
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

648
00:39:42.376 --> 00:39:45.963
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill

649
00:39:46.172 --> 00:39:48.674
approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

650
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.967
Well, there you have it.

651
00:39:51.928 --> 00:39:54.472
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

652
00:39:54.555 --> 00:39:57.809
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

653
00:39:58.184 --> 00:40:00.353
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

654
00:40:00.436 --> 00:40:03.231
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

655
00:40:03.773 --> 00:40:06.484
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

656
00:40:06.692 --> 00:40:09.612
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

657
00:40:09.695 --> 00:40:12.990
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

658
00:40:13.074 --> 00:40:17.703
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

659
00:40:17.787 --> 00:40:19.789
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

660
00:40:19.872 --> 00:40:23.793
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

661
00:40:24.418 --> 00:40:26.712
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

662
00:40:26.796 --> 00:40:29.465
We all did what we had to do.

663
00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:32.885
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

664
00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:34.846
That's all I have to say about that.

665
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.937
You can do this.

666
00:40:53.072 --> 00:40:54.532
Hi.

667
00:40:55.741 --> 00:40:57.743
I've been thinking.

668
00:40:59.245 --> 00:41:01.038
There's something
I want to ask you

669
00:41:01.122 --> 00:41:05.042
but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

670
00:41:07.378 --> 00:41:10.798
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

671
00:41:11.757 --> 00:41:14.177
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth

672
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.762
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

675

Until my brother died.

676
00:41:27.815 --> 00:41:29.692
That was when everything changed.

677
00:41:30.568 --> 00:41:34.071
<i>My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.</i>

678
00:41:34.155 --> 00:41:38.034
<i>After he died,
my parents became political.</i>

679
00:41:39.952 --> 00:41:43.581
<i>They protested the war
and the Reclamation.</i>

680
00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:46.083
<i>When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,</i>

681
00:41:46.167 --> 00:41:48.461
<i>they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

682
00:41:48.544 --> 00:41:50.588
<i>I watched on the television,</i>

683
00:41:50.796 --> 00:41:53.174
<i>thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.</i>

684
00:41:53.799 --> 00:41:56.260
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

685
00:41:56.344 --> 00:41:59.764
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.</i>

686
00:41:59.847 --> 00:42:02.975
<i>He said if we ran away,
they would win.</i>

687
00:42:03.059 --> 00:42:04.936
<i>Win, like</i>

688
00:42:05.019 --> 00:42:06.270
<i>it was a game.</i>

I wish I was...

but I'm not.

00:42:47.144 --> 00:42:50.356
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

700
00:42:52.066 --> 00:42:53.484
but I am.

701
00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:57.154
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

702
00:42:57.363 --> 00:43:02.159
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right,

703
00:43:03.411 --> 00:43:05.329
please let me know.

Worth a shot.

707
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.013
One thing is true of all governments:

708
00:43:22.096 --> 00:43:25.933
The most reliable records are tax records.

709
00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.776
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

710
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.864
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

711
00:43:39.947 --> 00:43:44.035
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

712
00:43:44.118 --> 00:43:46.454
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

713
00:43:46.537 --> 00:43:49.040

720
00:44:15.316 --> 00:44:17.735
- Of course.
- It appears that unforeseen circumstances

721

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.617
As a result, I'm in need of someone

I don't know, but this is interesting.

727
00:44:38.923 --> 00:44:42.468
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

729
00:44:45.846 --> 00:44:49.725
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

730
00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:52.103
Now, that is interesting.

731
00:44:53.604 --> 00:44:56.690
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

I've just received
your InterLink itinerary.

735
00:45:06.367 --> 00:45:09.286
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

736
00:45:09.495 --> 00:45:10.996
You're most diligent, Denis,

737
00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:15.126
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

738
00:45:15.209 --> 00:45:17.795
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

739
00:45:17.878 --> 00:45:21.006
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

740
00:45:21.674 --> 00:45:23.467
My last little joy.

741
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:25.344
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

742
00:45:26.554 --> 00:45:29.890
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

743
00:45:29.974 --> 00:45:33.310
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

744
00:45:33.394 --> 00:45:34.812
Older?

745
00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.189
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

746
00:45:37.314 --> 00:45:39.567
That is for Your Grace to decide.

747
00:45:51.704 --> 00:45:54.331
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

748
00:45:55.958 --> 00:46:00.963
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

749
00:46:02.882 --> 00:46:05.593
Mea culpa, my child.

750
00:46:05.676 --> 00:46:07.052
Mea culpa.

751
00:46:12.641 --> 00:46:16.061
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

A confession? I love the confession game.

753
00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:22.359
Tell me your sins.

754
00:46:22.443 --> 00:46:24.361
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

755
00:46:24.445 --> 00:46:26.780
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

756
00:46:27.072 --> 00:46:28.741
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this

757
00:46:28.824 --> 00:46:31.494
because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

758
00:46:31.577 --> 00:46:35.331
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

759
00:46:35.414 --> 00:46:38.626
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

760
00:46:38.709 --> 00:46:40.628
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

806
00:48:53.802 --> 00:48:56.513
a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

807
00:48:56.597 --> 00:48:59.433
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

808
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.186
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

809
00:49:02.269 --> 00:49:04.104
At this time, it would behoove you

810
00:49:04.188 --> 00:49:09.276
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed

811
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.821
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

812
00:49:13.489 --> 00:49:14.823
You mean Larkhill?

813
00:49:14.907 --> 00:49:18.535
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

814
00:49:18.744 --> 00:49:21.955
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

815
00:49:23.165 --> 00:49:26.043
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

816
00:49:26.752 --> 00:49:29.880
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

817
00:49:31.507 --> 00:49:33.801
I've been a party member for 27 years.

818
00:49:33.884 --> 00:49:36.261
If I were you, chief inspector,

819
00:49:36.345 --> 00:49:38.555
I'd find the terrorist

820
00:49:38.764 --> 00:49:40.641

If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

832
00:50:25.978 --> 00:50:27.604
You trusted me.

833
00:50:27.813 --> 00:50:30.858
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen.</i>

835
00:50:46.707 --> 00:50:49.501
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

836
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:53.797
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

837
00:50:53.881 --> 00:50:56.759
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel,

838
00:50:56.967 --> 00:50:58.719
it always cheers me up.

839
00:51:00.846 --> 00:51:04.933
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

840
00:51:05.017 --> 00:51:07.227
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

841
00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.480
But why would you keep it?

842
00:51:09.563 --> 00:51:12.900
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful or poetry moving.

843
00:51:12.983 --> 00:51:15.027
Is it worth it? If they found that here...

844
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:17.446
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

845
00:51:18.071 --> 00:51:20.073
Thank you, Gordon.

846
00:51:20.157 --> 00:51:22.367
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

847
00:51:22.493 --> 00:51:26.038
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

848
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:28.373
I was on my way here, and...

849
00:51:28.457 --> 00:51:30.042
Ah.

850
00:51:30.125 --> 00:51:31.627
Yes.

851
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.382
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

852
00:51:38.217 --> 00:51:39.676
- But...
- You're wondering why

853
00:51:39.885 --> 00:51:42.429
you were invited here to supper
in the first place

854
00:51:42.513 --> 00:51:46.683
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

855
00:51:46.767 --> 00:51:50.395
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain

856
00:51:50.479 --> 00:51:53.148
young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

857
00:51:53.398 --> 00:51:57.152
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired,

858
00:51:57.236 --> 00:52:01.281
I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.

859
00:52:01.365 --> 00:52:04.409
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

860
00:52:05.702 --> 00:52:07.621
The truth is, after so many years,

861
00:52:07.704 --> 00:52:11.208
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

862
00:52:11.416 --> 00:52:15.379
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

863

I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

864

But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

884
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.910

which was denied.

885

Running away?

886
00:53:30.078 --> 00:53:34.291
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

887

- That's what I'm guessing.

but I haven't heard back.

The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours,

1028

1030
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:05.069
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history

1031
01:03:05.153 --> 01:03:08.990
was not the work of religious extremists?

1032
01:03:09.073 --> 01:03:12.827
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

1033
01:03:12.911 --> 01:03:15.121
And they were executed. I know.

1034
01:03:15.205 --> 01:03:18.249

1036

1037
01:03:28.259 --> 01:03:29.886
What if that isn't what happened?

1038
01:03:30.094 --> 01:03:33.056

1039
01:03:33.139 --> 01:03:37.268
What if someone else
killed all those people?

She wrote the letter

You're getting back at them

1343
01:27:47.592 --> 01:27:50.845
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1344
01:27:50.929 --> 01:27:52.931
It's a basic principle of the universe

1345
01:27:53.014 --> 01:27:56.059
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1346
01:27:56.142 --> 01:27:57.602
Is that how you see it?

1347
01:27:57.686 --> 01:28:00.230
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1348
01:28:00.355 --> 01:28:02.482
And they created a monster.

1349
01:28:13.076 --> 01:28:16.121
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1350
01:28:17.163 --> 01:28:18.790
That would have scared me before

1351
01:28:18.873 --> 01:28:21.751

with a young, up-and-coming politician.

1423
01:33:04.617 --> 01:33:08.663
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1424
01:33:08.871 --> 01:33:13.251
<i>He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.</i>

1425
01:33:13.334 --> 01:33:16.587
<i>The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry</i>

1426
01:33:16.671 --> 01:33:19.299
<i>and the more aggressive
his supporters become.</i>

1427
01:33:20.174 --> 01:33:25.388
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.</i>

1428
01:33:25.471 --> 01:33:28.891
<i>At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons</i>

1429
01:33:28.975 --> 01:33:31.853
<i>and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.</i>

1430
01:33:31.936 --> 01:33:35.773
<i>However, the true goal
of this project is power.</i>

1431
01:33:35.857 --> 01:33:38.693
<i>Complete and total hegemonic domination.</i>

1432
01:33:38.776 --> 01:33:41.404
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

1433
01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:45.408
<i>But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain</i>

1434

how best to use such a weapon?</i>

1438

Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

always justify the means.</i>

I thought they closed this all down.

1657

They did.

1658
01:49:39.736 --> 01:49:43.573
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.

Only truth.

1669

And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong,

1670
01:50:36.793 --> 01:50:41.715
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1671
01:50:41.923 --> 01:50:44.718
- Why?
- Because this world,

And tomorrow,

and this choice belongs to them.

Where are you going?

1676
01:51:02.778 --> 01:51:05.197
The time has come for me
to meet my maker

1677
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:08.700
and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1678
01:51:08.784 --> 01:51:11.661
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1679
01:51:11.745 --> 01:51:14.373
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1680
01:51:14.456 --> 01:51:17.459
No. You were right about what I am.

01:58:40.026 --> 01:58:43.530
For 20 years, I sought only this day.

1769
01:58:43.613 --> 01:58:45.782
Nothing else existed...

1770
01:58:47.909 --> 01:58:49.911
until I saw you.

1771
01:58:51.037 --> 01:58:53.289
Then everything changed.

1772
01:58:54.707 --> 01:58:56.626
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1773
01:58:58.211 --> 01:59:01.422
like I no longer believed I could.

1774
01:59:01.506 --> 01:59:04.050
V, I don't want you to die.

1775
01:59:06.803 --> 01:59:10.598
That's the most beautiful thing

1776
01:59:10.682 --> 01:59:13.351
you could have ever given me.

1777
01:59:20.942 --> 01:59:22.360
V?

1778
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:24.863
V?

Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading towards Trafalgar Square.

1781
01:59:38.418 --> 01:59:40.503
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1782
02:00:12.702 --> 02:00:14.787
Hold it. Stop right there.

02:00:18.207 --> 02:00:19.751
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1784
02:00:27.717 --> 02:00:29.052
Then it's over?

1785
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:30.720
Almost.

1786
02:00:30.803 --> 02:00:33.348
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1787
02:00:35.642 --> 02:00:36.809
No.

Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1791

1793

- Because he was right.
- About what?

1794
02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:57.288
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.
