Shall I take you

182

Princess Charm School
was founded on
the principles

183

women with character
and confidence.

184
00:11:56.082 --> 00:12:00.416

them for royal Iife for
nearly five centuries.

She's the one who
entered me in the Iottery.

have come,

191

make a better Iife for
her and for my mom.

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:20.448
Yesterday Dame Devin
recommended we expel you.

524
00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:22.444
Oh.

525
00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.153
I can't say I blame her.

526
00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.690
I know it's only
been a couple of
days, but honestly,

527
00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:28.851
I don't think
I have ever seen

528
00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:31.896
such a disaster
of a student come
through these halls.

529
00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:33.891
I see.

530
00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:36.532
Tell you the truth,
I was almost going to do it.

531
00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.529
Did you say "almost"?

532
00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.097

533
00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:45.708
Do you know
what it takes to
make a princess?

534
00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:48.937
A crown?
No, not a crown.

535
00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:50.775

536
00:30:51.482 --> 00:30:55.475
AII our classes in
poise, manners, dancing,

537
00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.384
they're not superficial.

538
00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:59.320
They build confidence.

539
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:02.958
But confidence without
character is dangerous.

540
00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.689
You, BIair, have
a different problem.

to expel me?

deep and find the
princess inside you,

Iady royal position.

handle it.

548
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.485

do you say?

549
00:31:29.754 --> 00:31:30.914

When do we start?

553

Right now.

554
00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:46.499
I can do this
because I am
perfectly comfortable

555
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:49.597
and at ease
with myself and
in my body.

556
00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:52.702
That's because you're not
surrounded by people

a complete nothing.

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.740
ALL: AII done!

699
00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.102
These are beautiful.

700
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.077
FAIRIES: Thanks.

701
00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:53.910
We should go.

702
00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:56.748
The earlier we get
to the palace, the
more we can see.

703
00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:02.514
(GASPS)

704
00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:06.355
BLAIR: Our uniforms.

705
00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:15.634
Every one is in shreds!

706
00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:19.700
What are we going to do?

707
00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:22.575
We're not allowed in class
without our uniforms.

708
00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:25.345
And if we skip a class,
we get an F.

709
00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.481
We can't fail!

710
00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:30.345
Coronation Day
is two days away!

711
00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:33.381
How could this happen?

712
00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:37.018
Seriously?
It was Delancy.
It had to be.

713
00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:39.752
She's the queen of
"Make BIair Feel Inferior."

714
00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:41.921
No. She's not.

715
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.827
No one can make you
feel inferior.

716
00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:46.792
Not without your consent.

717
00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:49.797
We're princesses, right?

718
00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:51.901
We don't even have
our crowns yet.

719
00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.265
And you...

720
00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:57.444
I'm not talking about crowns.
I'm talking about character.

721
00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:01.575
The rule is we have
to show up to class
in uniform, right?

722
00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:04.748
Currently they're
a Iittle too breezy.

723
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:08.990
Hmm. They just need
a Iittle alteration.

724
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.094
Grace! Caprice! Harmony!

725
00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.058
Won't that
make them breezier?

726
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:35.280
Hmm. It seems BIair, Hadley,
and Isla are running Iate.

727
00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:37.454
I do hope they're
not skipping class.

728
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:40.490
I'd hate to fail anyone
so close to Coronation Day.

729
00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:41.680
(CHUCKLES)

730
00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:43.858
Well, time's up.

731
00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.855
Oh, come now,
Dame Devin.

732
00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:48.630
I think we can wait
a few minutes more.

733
00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:50.623
And keep the
other students waiting?

734
00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.032
That hardly seems fair.

735
00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.228
I'm afraid we'II have to
fail all three of them.

736
00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.294
BLAIR: Wait!

737
00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:59.608
What do you think
you're wearing?

738
00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.338
Those aren't school-issued
uniforms.

739
00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:04.444
Forgive me, madam,
but they are, in fact,

740
00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:07.278
made entirely from
the material in our
original uniforms.

741
00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.482
But that's against the rules.

742
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.886
Actually, Dame Devin, there is
nothing in the dress code
against what they've done.

743
00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:17.558
Right. We just used some
hard work to unlock
our princess potential.

744
00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.162
PRIVET:
And beautifully, at that.

745
00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:21.954
Come, join the class.

748
00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.213
Where did you get
new uniforms?

749
00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:48.222
Those are amazing!

750
00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.383
We made them.

751
00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:51.051
BIair made them.

752
00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:53.987
How did you do that?

753
00:43:54.698 --> 00:43:55.995
I want one.

754
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.627
I didn't know
people made clothes.

755
00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:02.435
I thought they
came from elves.
You know, Iike toast.

756
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.873
PRIVET: Attention, everyone.

757
00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:08.573
Welcome to the royal
palace of Gardania.

758
00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:12.938
As a special treat
you will have some time
before the meal

759
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.846
to explore the first
floor of the palace.

760
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.285
Enjoy!

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.718
Sweet. Royal secrets,
here we come!

763
00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.167
(GASPS) No way.

764
00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:34.465
BIair. It's a
picture of BIair.

765
00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.363
That's not possible.

766
00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.468
Why would there be
a portrait of me?

767
00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:45.181
"Princess Isabella, age 18."

768
00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:55.747
That dog.

769
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.585
It couldn't be!

770
00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.461
"Queen Isabella,
King Reginald,

771
00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:04.900
"the Princess Sophia,
and their Ioyal dog,

772
00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:06.962
"Prince."

773
00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:08.836
No way!

774
00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:12.465
BIair? Do you know
when your mom found
you on her doorstep?

775
00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:13.869
The date? Sure.

776
00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:16.576
I mean, she made it
my birthday since she
didn't know my real one.

777
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.074
April 26th.

778
00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:21.409
What?

779
00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:25.515
BIair, you know what
April 26th is, don't you?

780
00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:27.856
BLAIR: Um, yeah.

781
00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:30.787
My birthday.
I just said that.

782
00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:34.223
It's the day the
royal family died
in that car crash.

783
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:39.764
I'm thinking maybe
baby Sophia didn't
die in that crash.

784
00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:43.529
Maybe she was
found and Ieft on
someone's doorstep.

785
00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:45.232
No!

786
00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.136
Yes, Iook at the portrait.

787
00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:49.438
You Iook exactly
Iike Queen Isabella!

788
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.647
You could be
baby Sophia.

789

If it's true, and Dame Devin
and Delancy know it,

790
00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:57.981
that would explain why
they're so awful to you,

791
00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:01.921
because you're the
rightful heir to the throne,
and not Delancy!

792

Okay.

793
00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.062
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

you know.

797
00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:18.935

Excuse me!

about how she'II handle things
when she's crowned princess

Huh?

Uh...

I...

808
00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:11.620
My brilliant daughter
noticed that Gardania's
poorer sections

809
00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:14.459
are a blight to the otherwise
beautiful community.

810
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.493
(GASPS)
Hey!

811
00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.134
To remedy this
she will take over
those areas,

812
00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:23.638
bulldoze the buildings,
and turn the Iand into
beautiful rolling parks,

813
00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:26.799
full of trees and grass,
and streams.

814
00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.078
Wonderful for the environment.

815
00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:33.238
But people Iive in those
areas you just knocked down.

816
00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:35.679
My neighborhood is there.

817
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.209
It is?

818
00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.316
Delancy is
aware of that.

819
00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:41.186
Those people will
move elsewhere.

820
00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.759
How? They're Iike me.

821
00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:46.894
They don't have money.
They can't just pick up
and move.

822
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.191
If I were you I'd Ieave
this school immediately

823

ready to move.

To fight.

839
00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:20.881

she's going to ruin my family,

prove someone else

It must be
in the palace. Right?

The crown glows when
placed on the true
heir of Gardania.

before Delancy's coronation.

What?

878
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.875
I'm sure it's some
kind of mistake,

879
00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:33.120

you stole her jewelry.

880

No! I would never!

881

no choice.

to the detaining room.

907

until after the ceremony
tomorrow.

Now neither of you
will become princesses.

922

Don't sweat it.

924

your head itch.

925

to kick a ball
in four-inch heels.

in mind for the prisoners.

928

over to me.

BIair?

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.202
If you're
a princess now,

1232
01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.612
does that mean
I'm a princess, too?

1233
01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.048
Of course.

Na, na, na

1275
01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:36.303

That sets the girl apart

Is the kindness
that shows royalty
