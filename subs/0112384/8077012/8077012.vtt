00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.464
<i>The crew's
crossing gantry for capsule ingress.</i>

2
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.383
<i>Roger that.</i>

3
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.843
<i>Inspired by
the late President Kennedy,</i>

4
00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:56.807
<i>in only seven years, America has
risen to the challenge of what he called,</i>

5
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.644
<i>"The most hazardous and
dangerous and greatest adventure</i>

6
00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.480
<i>"on which man
has ever embarked."</i>

7
00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:08.193
<i>After trailing the Russians for
years with our manned space program</i>

8
00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:10.946
<i>and after that sudden
and horrible fire</i>

9
00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.323
<i>on the launch pad
during a routine test</i>

10
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.201
<i>that killed American
astronauts Gus Grissom,</i>

11
00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:18.662
<i>Ed White and Roger Chaffee,</i>

12
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.457
<i>there were serious doubts that we
could beat the Russians to the moon.</i>

13
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.420
<i>But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of</i> Apollo 1,

14
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.674
{\an8}<i>the entire world watched in awe
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin</i>

15
00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.384
<i>landed on the moon.</i>

16
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.012
<i>The big news
came just a moment ago.</i>

17
00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:37.889
<i>Mission Control gave
the spacecraft permission</i>

18
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:41.018
<i>to go for
the extravehicular activity,</i>

19
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.853
<i>that is,
for the walk on the moon</i>

20
00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:47.441
<i>far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time...</i>

21
00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.485
The important thing when
you penetrate the lunar module

22
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.322
is your attitude
and relative speed.

23
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.867
Let's say this is me here in the
command module and this is you...

24
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.702
- All right.
- ...in the LEM.

25
00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:00.829
This thing sticking out here
is called the probe.

26
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.955
Is that true?

27
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.123
Absolutely.

28
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:07.294
Tracey, when you feel that
thing slide in, everything's clicking,

29
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.380
it's like no other
feeling in the world.

30
00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.384
A little liquid propulsion.
What's the big occasion?

31
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.386
How's it going at
Mission Control?

32
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:19.264
It's a nervous time. They're
pacing around and smoking.

33
00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:22.017
Gene Kranz is gonna
have puppies. Jim Lovell.

34
00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.101
This is Tracey.

35
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:25.062
- How do you do, Tracey?
- This is the man.

36
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.397
<i>Gemini 7. Gemini 12.
Apollo 8.</i>

37
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.875
They were the first
around the moon.

38
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.192
This guy did 10 laps.

39
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.070
With one hand on the wheel.
Make yourselves at home.

40
00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.407
This is the last champagne
in the city of Houston.

41
00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.450
Very good.

42
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.576
Everything else all right?

43
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:40.678
Everything's on course.

44
00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.746
- Looks okay. Cadet Lovell.
- Hey, Dad.

45
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.332
Put this on ice.
Make sure it gets cold.

46
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.125
You gonna get
a haircut this week?

47
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.502
I'm on vacation.

48
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.046
Oh, get a haircut.

49
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.973
I wouldn't mind
being up there tonight.

50
00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.725
God, who wouldn't.

51
00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.103
Don't worry.
Our day's coming.

52
00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:10.190
{\an8}They're not gonna cut the
program before number 14.

53
00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.359
You know, my cousin called.

54
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.612
Asked who we bribed to
get on Jim Lovell's crew.

55
00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:18.949
I told him they wanted to
make sure he got the best.

56
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.326
Well, they got that right.

57
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.744
What network do we want?

58
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:25.664
Put on Walter!

59
00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.957
Jules Bergman!

60
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.792
John, turn it up!

61
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.133
I really appreciate

62
00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:40.303
you all coming to this dress
rehearsal party for my <i>Apollo 12</i> landing.

63
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.013
Sit down, Conrad.

64
00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:45.016
I think we should all take
a moment to recognize

65
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.977
the exemplary,

66
00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.813
hell, damn near heroic effort

67
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:54.568
displayed by Neil Armstrong's
backup for this historic moon walk

68
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.694
and, of course, his crew.

69
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:59.489
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,
Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

70
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.373
There he is!
Everybody quiet down!

71
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.167
Hey! Kids!

72
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.253
<i>You got a good picture, huh?</i>

73
00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:18.175
<i>We can verify the position of the
opening I ought to have on the camera.</i>

74
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.389
You think it's too
late for him to abort?

75
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:26.016
He still has time to get out.

76
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.768
He just needs somebody
to wave him off.

77
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.894
Pull up, Neil!

78
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.270
Pull up!

79
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:36.318
<i>Neil, we can see
you coming down the ladder now.</i>

80
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.862
<i>Look at those pictures.</i>

81
00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.406
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

82
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.744
<i>The LEM footpads are only
depressed in the surface about</i>

83
00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.330
<i>one or two inches.</i>

84
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.207
<i>It's almost like a powder.</i>

85
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.875
<i>Armstrong is on the moon.</i>

86
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.337
<i>Neil Armstrong,
38-year-old American</i>

87
00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.215
<i>standing on
the surface of the moon</i>

88
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.886
<i>on this July 20, 1969.</i>

89
00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:05.680
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

90
00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:10.560
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

91
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.814
<i>His quote was,</i>

92
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:18.401
<i>"That's one small step for
man, one giant leap for mankind."</i>

93
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.043
You're drunk, Lovell.

94
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.004
I'm not used to the champagne.

95
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:39.673
Me, neither.

96
00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.137
I can't deal with cleaning
up. Let's sell the house.

97
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.515
All right, let's sell the house.

98
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:53.061
They're back inside
now looking up at us.

99
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.105
Isn't that something?

100
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.317
I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't
get a wink of sleep tonight.

101
00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:03.697
When you were on
the far side on 8, I didn't sleep at all.

102
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.533
I just vacuumed
over and over again.

103
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:10.829
Christopher Columbus, Charles
Lindbergh, and Neil Armstrong.

104
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.625
Neil Armstrong.

105
00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:30.515
From now on, we live in a world
where man has walked on the moon.

106
00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.477
It's not a miracle.

107
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.106
We just decided to go.

108
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.651
On <i>Apollo 8,</i> we were so close,

109
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.654
just 60 nautical miles
down and...

110
00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.118
It was as if I could just

111
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.663
step out and walk
on the face of it.

112
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.421
I want to go back there.

113
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.930
Where's my mountain?

114
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.727
It's right up by the...

115
00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.230
Do you see where
the shadow crosses

116
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.943
the white area there?
That's the Sea of Tranquillity,

117
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.153
and your mountain's
on the edge of that.

118
00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.073
It's your mountain, Marilyn.
Mount Marilyn.

119
00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.617
I don't see it.

120
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.538
Well, you gotta look harder.

121
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.293
You look harder,

122
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.214
while I...

123
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.229
{\an8}<i>The astronaut is the most
visible member of a very large team.</i>

124
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.482
<i>All of us, down to the
guy sweeping the floor</i>

125
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.734
<i>are honored to be a part of it.</i>

126
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.778
<i>What did the man say?
"Give me a lever long enough</i>

127
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.154
<i>"and I'll move the world"?</i>

128
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:11.992
<i>That's what we're doing here.
This is divine inspiration, folks.</i>

129
00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:16.246
<i>It's the best part of each one of us,
the belief that anything is possible.</i>

130
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:20.208
Things like a computer
that can fit into a single room

131
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.628
and hold millions
of pieces of information

132
00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.506
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

133
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.592
This is the actual launch vehicle
that will be taking Alan Shepard

134
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:33.930
and his crew on the first leg
of the <i>Apollo 13</i> mission.

135
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.474
When are you
going up again, Jim?

136
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:41.521
I'm slated to be the commander of
<i>Apollo 14</i> sometime late next year.

137
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.357
If there is an <i>Apollo 14.</i>

138
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:50.113
People in my state have been
asking why we're continuing

139
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:54.117
to fund this program now that we've
beaten the Russians to the moon.

140
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.537
Imagine if Christopher Columbus
had come back from the New World

141
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.539
and no one returned
in his footsteps.

142
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.917
<i>Attention,
all personnel. Clear level 3.</i>

143
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.755
Are there any other questions?

144
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.133
How do you go to
the bathroom in space?

145
00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.761
It's a highly technical process

146
00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.765
of cranking down the window
and looking for a gas station which...

147
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.726
There's Deke Slayton.

148
00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.480
You might be able to answer
this lady's question.

149
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.317
Deke is one of the original <i>Mercury
7</i> astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

150
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.401
Now he's our boss.

151
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.820
He hands out the
astronauts' flight assignments,

152
00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:33.948
so naturally we kick back
part of our salaries to Deke.

153
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.283
How much this month?

154
00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.702
Can I have a minute?
Something's come up.

155
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:38.828
Sure.

156
00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:42.165
Hey!

157
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.379
Anybody home?

158
00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.173
I'm not being
a cheerleader, Mom!

159
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.133
You don't understand!
I worked so hard!

160
00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.885
Maybe I don't understand,

161
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.721
but you are not wearing
that out in this neighborhood.

162
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.349
She's not even wearing a
bra! You can see everything!

163
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.642
Shut up!

164
00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.686
Hey, everybody.
Marilyn, trick or treat.

165
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:07.649
You know that Easter vacation
trip we had planned for Acapulco?

166
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.487
I was thinking there might be
a slight change in destination.

167
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.738
Really?

168
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.575
Maybe, say, the moon.

169
00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.331
Al Shepard's ear
infection has flared up,

170
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:27.335
and we've all been bumped up
to the prime crew of <i>Apollo 13.</i>

171
00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:32.090
Straight to the head of the line
and the Fra Mauro Highlands.

172
00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.717
Six months? You're
moving up six months?

173
00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.886
Dad, can I please wear this?

174
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:38.888
Sure.

175
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.723
No! Absolutely not.

176
00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.437
They're not rushing
things, are they?

177
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.064
You'll be ready in six months?

178
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.149
We'll be ready.

179
00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.026
I wouldn't want to be
around Al Shepard tonight.

180
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:55.405
I gotta get over there and
get up to speed on this.

181
00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.531
Go.

182
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.450
I'm gonna walk on
the moon, Marilyn.

183
00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.619
I know.
I can't believe it.

184
00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.415
Naturally, it's 13.
Why 13?

185
00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.168
It comes after 12, hon.

186
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:15.091
<i>Apollo 13, you
are go for pyro arm and docking.</i>

187
00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:18.803
<i>All systems are nominal
and on the line.</i>

188
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:23.183
<i>S-4B is stable,
SLA panels are drifting free.</i>

189
00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.436
<i>The drogue is clear.
The docking target is clear.</i>

190
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.941
<i>I'm coming up on
that now. Two, one, mark.</i>

191
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.236
Seventy-five feet.
We're coming up on docking.

192
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:39.115
Let's shut down some thrusters
on them. Let's see what he does.

193
00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.952
Whoa! Wait a minute.

194
00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.288
I lost something here.
I can't translate up.

195
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.124
Houston, we are
drifting down and away.

196
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.959
Wanna back off
and take another run?

197
00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.419
No, I got it.

198
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.130
Let me just try
and get it stable here.

199
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:56.633
I'm gonna reset the high gain.

200
00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:59.135
I've got the target
back in the reticle.

201
00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.346
Okay, we're stable.
Recycle the valves.

202
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.014
Forty feet.

203
00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.974
They're all gray.

204
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:08.811
Twenty.

205
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.399
Ten feet.

206
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.153
Capture.

207
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.655
That's it!

208
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.240
That's it.

209
00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.408
Sweet move, Ken.
Beautiful.

210
00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.511
Gentlemen, that is
the way we do that.

211
00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.079
Man, that woke me up.

212
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:30.458
<i>Apollo 13 backup
crew, you're up in the simulator.</i>

213
00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.002
Nice job, gentlemen.

214
00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.462
That's three hours of boredom

215
00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.839
followed by seven
seconds of sheer terror.

216
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:40.218
Good job, guys. You just
won the Christmas turkey.

217
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.345
Nice try, Frank.

218
00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:45.014
You really outfoxed them.

219
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.850
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
Used up too much fuel.

220
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.519
You're above the curve.

221
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.689
Not by much. Listen,
guys, I wanna work it again.

222
00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:58.820
We gotta be up with the dawn
patrol headed for Bethpage at 0700.

223
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.655
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, I know,

224
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.324
but my rate of turn is
still a little slow there.

225
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:06.035
I really think
we should work it again.

226
00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.996
Let's get it right.

227
00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.956
Set it up again, Frank.

228
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.210
<i>Okay, 13
backup crew. It'll have to wait.</i>

229
00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.546
<i>Prime crew's up for another run.</i>

230
00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.718
<i>Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown</i>

231
00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.803
<i>and all systems are nominal.</i>

232
00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.139
<i>Fred, set the S-band omni to B,</i>

233
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.891
<i>and when you get in the LEM,
to forward.</i>

234
00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:30.893
<i>Good shape over here.</i>

235
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:34.939
Hey, we got a problem.

236
00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.567
Cabin depress.
Repeat, cabin depress.

237
00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.736
Ken, get your helmet on!

238
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.404
I can't get it locked!

239
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:45.742
Houston, something ripped a
big hole in us! We got rapid depress!

240
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.243
Oh, God!

241
00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:19.609
I thought the stars
would fall on you.

242
00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:23.029
That's silly.
Stars can't fall on us.

243
00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.822
You're a smarter kid than I was.

244
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.784
How long will it take you
to get to the moon?

245
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.202
Four days.

246
00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.622
But that's pretty fast.

247
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.958
See, this is the
Saturn 4B booster

248
00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.544
and it shoots us
away from the Earth

249
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:42.799
as fast as a bullet from a gun

250
00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:47.762
until the moon's gravity
actually grabs us and pulls us

251
00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:52.350
into a circle around the moon,

252
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.936
which is called
an orbit. All right?

253
00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:59.315
Fred and I float down the
tunnel into the lunar module,

254
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.067
this spidery-looking guy.

255
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.862
Only holds two people, and
it's just for landing on the moon.

256
00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:09.951
And I take the controls,
steer it around and I fly it down,

257
00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:13.830
adjusting it here, the
attitude there, pitch, roll,

258
00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:17.792
for a nice, soft
landing on the moon.

259
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:21.671
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.

260
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:29.762
Did you know the
astronauts in the fire?

261
00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:36.018
Yeah. I knew the astronauts
in the fire. All of them.

262
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.983
Could that happen again?

263
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:46.320
Well, I'll tell you
something about that fire.

264
00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.489
A lot of things went wrong.

265
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.868
The door.

266
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.246
It's called the hatch.

267
00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.874
They couldn't get it open
when they needed to get out.

268
00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.709
That was one thing.

269
00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.714
A lot of things
went wrong in that fire.

270
00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.343
Did they fix it?

271
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.138
Oh, yes, absolutely.
We fixed it.

272
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:15.057
It's not a problem anymore.

273
00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:29.071
I can't believe they still have
you doing public appearances.

274
00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:33.409
Well, Henry Hurt
was all over me.

275
00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:37.246
With a training schedule this
tight, they shouldn't be asking.

276
00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.790
It's the program, Marilyn.
You know, it's NASA.

277
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.293
Hey, you're Jim Lovell,
aren't you?

278
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.921
Hey!
Lucky <i>13!</i>

279
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:46.756
Right on!

280
00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.308
That's the second time
it's done that.

281
00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:10.363
I was looking at the kids'
school schedule coming up.

282
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.615
It's a very busy week.

283
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.620
I'm thinking about
not going to the launch.

284
00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:22.583
Huh.

285
00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.628
The kids need me at home.

286
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:29.006
Marilyn, we've had these kids
for a while now.

287
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.677
They've never kept you from
coming to the other launches.

288
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.304
But your mother
just had this stroke.

289
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.639
Mom's fine.

290
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.975
It's not like I've never
been to a launch.

291
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.561
The other wives
have not done three.

292
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.064
I just don't think I
can go through all that.

293
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.446
I'll just be glad
when this one's over.

294
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.785
You're gonna miss
a hell of a show.

295
00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.838
Hey, guys.
See you in a few weeks.

296
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.465
Take care. Bring
us back a moon rock.

297
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.828
The number 13
doesn't bother you?

298
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.872
Only if it's a Friday, Phil.

299
00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:47.209
<i>Apollo 13,</i> lifting off
at 1300 hours and 13 minutes

300
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.254
and entering the moon's
gravity on April 13?

301
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:54.467
Ken Mattingly here has been
doing some scientific experiments

302
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.469
regarding that very phenomenon.

303
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:59.722
Oh, yes, well, I had a black cat

304
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.476
walk over a broken mirror
under the lunar module ladder.

305
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.144
It didn't seem to be a problem.

306
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.271
We're considering
a letter we got

307
00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.857
which said we ought to take
a pig with us for good luck.

308
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:14.987
Does it bother you that the
public regards this flight as routine?

309
00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.908
There's nothing routine about flying
to the moon. I can vouch for that.

310
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.788
I think that an
astronaut's last mission,

311
00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:27.750
his final flight is
always very special.

312
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.420
Why is this your last, Jim?

313
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:35.049
I'm in command of the best ship

314
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:38.094
with the best crew that
anybody could ask for,

315
00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:41.722
and I'll be walking in a place
where there's 400 degrees difference

316
00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:43.933
between sunlight and shadow.

317
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:48.562
I can't imagine
ever topping that.

318
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.613
We have that scheduled
for 0900 hours tomorrow.

319
00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:58.715
That's not gonna work, Walter.

320
00:19:58.739 --> 00:19:59.949
Why?

321
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.744
Freddo and I are going over the
lunar surface experiments tomorrow,

322
00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.955
and Ken's gonna be
back in the simulator.

323
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.040
We're going over
the flight plan tonight.

324
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:11.627
Gonna pay a visit to this
machine after you're hard down.

325
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.505
Jim, we've got a problem.

326
00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.383
We just got some blood
work back from the lab.

327
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:19.635
Charlie Duke has the measles.

328
00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:22.555
So we need a new backup.

329
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:24.974
You've all been exposed to it.

330
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.475
I've had the measles.

331
00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:28.644
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

332
00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:32.982
You wanna break up my crew
two days before the launch

333
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.192
when we can predict
each other's moves,

334
00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.653
read the tone
of each other's voices?

335
00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:40.072
Ken Mattingly
will get seriously ill

336
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:44.285
precisely when you and Haise will
be ascending from the lunar surface.

337
00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.078
That's a lousy time for a fever.

338
00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.165
Jack Swigert has been
out of the loop for weeks.

339
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.333
He's fully qualified
to fly this mission.

340
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:55.504
He's a fine pilot, but when was
the last time he was in a simulator?

341
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.507
I'm sorry, Jim.
I understand how you feel.

342
00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.509
We can do one of two things.

343
00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.471
We can either scrub Mattingly
and go with Swigert,

344
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:06.807
or we can bump all three
of you to a later mission.

345
00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.190
I've trained for the
Fra Mauro Highlands,

346
00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:18.402
and this is flight
surgeon horseshit, Deke!

347
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:23.157
Jim, if you hold out for Ken,
you will not be on <i>Apollo 13.</i>

348
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.202
It's your decision.

349
00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:31.457
Let it ring.

350
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.584
Listen, I gotta take that.

351
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:34.668
Why?

352
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.378
Because I'm on the backup crew,

353
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.341
and the backup crew has to set up
the guest list and book the hotel rooms.

354
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.718
Yeah.

355
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.474
Yes, sir.

356
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.601
I understand.

357
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:52.895
Thank you, sir.

358
00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.009
Damn.

359
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.392
Medical guys.

360
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:37.356
I had a feeling when they started
doing all the blood tests that...

361
00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:45.823
I mean, I know it's their ass if I get
sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!

362
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:04.675
Swigert, he'll be fine.

363
00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:09.305
He's strong.

364
00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:15.603
It'll be a hell of a mission.
One for the books.

365
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:23.485
You sure about this?
Why don't I talk to Deke?

366
00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:25.779
I'm sure we can work this out.

367
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:29.450
This was my call.

368
00:23:40.294 --> 00:23:42.296
Must've been a tough one.

369
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.262
Look, I don't have the measles.

370
00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.933
I'm not gonna get the measles.

371
00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:00.105
Ken, wait up.

372
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.696
Trajectory is holding steady.
We're right on the line.

373
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.201
We're into
program 64 at .05 G,

374
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.994
so we're feeling
that gravity now.

375
00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:17.790
Houston, we are at 400,000
feet passing entry interface.

376
00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.084
<i>About to lose signal.</i>

377
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:24.129
<i>Re-entry data is
nominal, and we have radio blackout.</i>

378
00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:30.344
What's the story here?

379
00:24:30.928 --> 00:24:34.223
I got a corridor light.
We're coming in too shallow.

380
00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:36.350
I'm going to manual.

381
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.564
Houston, switching to SCS.

382
00:24:42.606 --> 00:24:43.607
<i>Roger,</i> 13.

383
00:24:43.691 --> 00:24:45.651
Okay, we're at three Gs.

384
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:47.736
Five Gs.

385
00:24:49.863 --> 00:24:51.573
We're coming in too steep.

386
00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:55.244
I'm gonna stay in this roll
and see if I can pull us out.

387
00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:57.079
We're at eight Gs.

388
00:24:57.871 --> 00:24:58.956
Nine.

389
00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:00.708
Ten.

390
00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:04.086
We're at 12 Gs.

391
00:25:04.128 --> 00:25:06.088
12 Gs. We're burning up.

392
00:25:07.798 --> 00:25:09.049
Damn it!

393
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:12.177
I gave them a false indicator
light at entry interface.

394
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:14.430
Even Mattingly didn't
get it the first time.

395
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:16.598
How are you feeling, Freddo?

396
00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:18.517
Charbroiled.

397
00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:24.648
What happened?

398
00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:26.942
Came in too steep.
We're dead.

399
00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:29.278
No shit.

400
00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:32.114
We were into program 67 there.

401
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:38.662
We're gonna do
this again, obviously.

402
00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:41.373
<i>Give us a minute
to get our switches reset.</i>

403
00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:43.292
Jim, could we have a word?

404
00:25:46.128 --> 00:25:47.504
Sure, Deke.

405
00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:57.639
<i>We're going to drop offline
and debrief this one on our own.</i>

406
00:26:02.144 --> 00:26:04.480
If I had a dollar every time
they killed me in this thing,

407
00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:06.690
I wouldn't have to
work for you, Deke.

408
00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:15.741
Well, we have two days.
We'll be ready.

409
00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:17.701
Let's do it again.

410
00:26:19.495 --> 00:26:20.537
Do it again.

411
00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:34.176
Get down, Fred!
Stephen, come here!

412
00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:38.388
We can't go across that road.

413
00:26:38.722 --> 00:26:42.518
We don't want Daddy to get our
germs and get sick in outer space.

414
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:46.063
Hey, boys. Not giving your
mom a hard time, are you?

415
00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:49.483
Princess, you look beautiful.

416
00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:13.841
That looks like Marilyn Lovell.

417
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:16.885
But it can't be. She's
not coming to the launch.

418
00:27:16.927 --> 00:27:19.096
I heard it was gonna
be a hell of a show.

419
00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.556
Who told you that?

420
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.224
Some guy I know.

421
00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:28.397
You can't live without me.

422
00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:31.692
Okay, folks.
Let's say goodnight.

423
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:33.610
We got a big day
tomorrow for these guys.

424
00:27:33.694 --> 00:27:35.487
Goodnight!

425
00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:37.281
You hear about Ken?

426
00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:39.032
Yeah.

427
00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:00.721
Stand back, please.

428
00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.850
Guenter Wendt!

429
00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:08.520
I wonder where Guenter went?

430
00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:13.901
You walk on the moon, <i>ja?</i>

431
00:28:13.984 --> 00:28:17.446
<i>Ja, we</i> walk and
we talk on the moon.

432
00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:28.707
How
do you feel? Pretty good?

433
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.919
Might be a little
warmer in here.

434
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.563
- How are you today?
- Good.

435
00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:35.214
- Ready?
- Yeah.

436
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:02.950
God, no.

437
00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:16.022
Okay, we
have the oxygen purge system.

438
00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:17.047
Check.

439
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.316
We have
the helmet restraint ring.

440
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.133
Check.

441
00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:33.855
Communication umbilical on.

442
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.148
- Fred.
- What?

443
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.525
- Gum.
- Sorry.

444
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:40.821
Thanks.

445
00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:45.492
I'm gonna give these
guys a beautiful ride.

446
00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:47.536
I'm sure you will, Jack.

447
00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:03.427
You need more air?

448
00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:20.986
You want some apple?

449
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:25.657
I hate this already.

450
00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:27.409
You're not just about
to pop, are you?

451
00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:31.246
No. I got 30 days
till this blasts off.

452
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:17.542
This is for Gene.

453
00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:23.840
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out
the needle and thread again.

454
00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:26.009
The last one looked like
he bought it off a gypsy.

455
00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:28.678
Well, you can't
argue with tradition.

456
00:31:28.762 --> 00:31:30.263
Copy that.

457
00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:32.599
This is from your wife, Gene.

458
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:34.476
Thank you, Tom.

459
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:36.978
I was starting to get worried.

460
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.648
There we go.

461
00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:43.068
I like that one, Gene.

462
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:44.194
Sharp, Gene.

463
00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:00.460
Jim, you're all set.

464
00:32:09.678 --> 00:32:11.012
Very sharp.

465
00:32:11.847 --> 00:32:14.182
Gene, I guess we can go now.

466
00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:16.476
Save it for splashdown, guys.

467
00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:38.707

That was some little jolt.

Tower jett.

520
00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:09.561
Houston, we've got a center
engine cut-off. Go on the other four.

521
00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:15.316
Roger that, <i>13.</i>
We show the same.

522
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.610
Booster, can you
confirm that cut-off?

523
00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:19.446
Roger. Looks like
we lost it.

524
00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:21.322
FIDO, what'll that do to us?

525
00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:22.657
Stand by, Flight.

526
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.502
I need to know if the IUs are
correcting for the number five shutdown.

527
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.338
Houston, what's the story
on engine five?

528
00:37:40.008 --> 00:37:41.551
We're still go.

529
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:44.345
We'll be all right as long as
we don't lose another one.

530
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:45.430
Roger that.

531
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:47.599
We're not sure
why the inboard was out,

532
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:51.144
but the other engines are go, so
we're gonna burn those engines

533
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.979
a little bit longer.

534
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:55.607
Roger that.
Our gimbals are good.

535
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:57.942
Our trim is good.

536
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:04.532
Looks like we just had
our glitch for this mission.

537
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:16.044
<i>stand by for staging.</i>

538
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:17.545
Roger that.

539
00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:20.423
<i>S-2 shutdown.
S-4B ignition.</i>

540
00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:23.551
<i>Thrust looks good, Flight.</i>

541
00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.305
Flight, S-4B cut-off
in 10 seconds.

542
00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:31.559
<i>13,</i> this is Houston. Predicted
cut-off is 12 plus 34, over.

543
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.730
Coming up on 12 minutes, 34.

544
00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:38.900
And...

545
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:43.530
<i>Shutdown.</i>

546
00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:46.574
<i>And that, gentlemen,
is how we do that.</i>

547
00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:15.770
Oh, boy.
Hope I can sleep.

548
00:39:15.812 --> 00:39:17.772
Mom, that was loud.

549
00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:19.858
Here, hold my hand.

550
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:23.319
I can't believe you
did this four times.

551
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:24.863
The worst part's over.

552
00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:26.322
It is?

553
00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:31.953
Listen, this doesn't stop for me
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

554
00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.247
Well, you just look
so calm about it.

555
00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:38.376
If the flight surgeon had to okay
me for this mission, I'd be grounded.

556
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:39.770
Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!

557
00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:41.713
Can we speak to you?

558
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:44.299
Can we just have a
word with you, please?

559
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.260
Remember, you're proud,
happy, and thrilled.

560
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.470
How're you feeling?

561
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:50.513
Very proud,

562
00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:52.640
and very happy,
and we're thrilled.

563
00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:59.147
<i>Flight, Booster.
I show S-4B shutdown.</i>

564
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:02.525
TLI is on the money.
Looks good, Flight.

565
00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:04.527
Roger, FIDO.

566
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:07.113
Okay, guys.

567
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:09.782
We're going to the moon!

568
00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:12.136
Flight, we have
reacquisition of signal at Hawaii.

569
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.412
Flight, everything looks good.

570
00:40:15.872 --> 00:40:17.874
Okay, Houston.
CMP here.

571
00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:21.502
I've exchanged couches
with Jim. I'm in the pilot's seat.

572
00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:25.924
I'm gonna go ahead and get
set for transposition and docking.

573
00:40:26.007 --> 00:40:28.092
<i>Roger that, Jack.</i>

574
00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:42.774
Freddo, you okay?

575
00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:49.572
<i>Everybody, let's get turned
around and pick up the lunar module.</i>

576
00:40:49.656 --> 00:40:52.992
Odyssey, you're go
for pyro arm and docking,

577
00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:56.037
and we recommend you
secure cabin pressurization.

578
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:58.539
<i>Roger that.</i>

579
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.043
Okay, we're ready
for CSM separation.

580
00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:07.715
Okay, SMRCS isol valves
are all gray.

581
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.969
Okay, Swigert,
command module pilot.

582
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:12.804
She's all yours.

583
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:19.811
<i>Houston,
we've got a good separation.</i>

584
00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:21.270
<i>The S-4B is stable.</i>

585
00:41:21.354 --> 00:41:22.689
<i>Translation looks good.</i>

586
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.148
Reconfirm then, 13.

587
00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:26.067
<i>We're gonna
start to pitch around</i>

588
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.902
<i>to line up with the LEM.</i>

589
00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.530
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman

590
00:41:31.072 --> 00:41:33.408
was upchucking most of the
way to the moon on <i>Apollo 8.</i>

591
00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:37.286
I'm all right. I just ate too
much breakfast. Let's go to work.

592
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.540
And pitching up.

593
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.751
Pitch rate,
2.5 degrees per second.

594
00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:45.920
<i>Roger, Jack.</i>

595
00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:48.131
We see you pitching around.

596
00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:49.674
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

597
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:50.758
Roger that.

598
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.095
If Swigert can't dock this
thing, we don't have a mission.

599
00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:56.764
How's the alignment?

600
00:41:56.806 --> 00:41:58.141
GDC align.

601
00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:05.356
Thrusting forward.

602
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.110
<i>One hundred feet.</i>

603
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:16.284
Watch the alignment now.

604
00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:27.128
Don't worry, guys.
I'm on top of it.

605
00:42:32.341 --> 00:42:34.069
<i>FIDO, let
me know when you're ready.</i>

606
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:36.387
<i>Let's uplink that.</i>

607
00:42:37.513 --> 00:42:39.515
- How we looking?
- We're not there yet.

608
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.975
Forty feet.

609
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.062
<i>Twenty.</i>

610
00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:51.319
Come on, rookie,
park that thing.

611
00:42:57.408 --> 00:42:58.659
Ten feet.

612
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.922
Capture.

613
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:12.840
That's it.

614
00:43:12.882 --> 00:43:14.300
Talk back is barber pole.

615
00:43:14.342 --> 00:43:16.177
Go ahead and retract.

616
00:43:19.555 --> 00:43:21.516
Houston, we have hard dock.

617
00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:24.477
Roger, we
understand. That's a good deal, Jack.

618
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:27.230
Let's start
back up with procedure 17.

619
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:31.234
<i>Houston, we have LEM extraction.</i>

620
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:33.361
We copy that, 13.

621
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.655
<i>Now you're off to
the Fra Mauro Highlands.</i>

622
00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:37.406
I gotta get out of this suit.

623
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.283
Houston, we are ready

624
00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:41.744
for the beginning of the PTC,

625
00:43:41.828 --> 00:43:46.040
and I think once we're in that
barbecue roll, Jack and I will eat.

626
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:47.875
Hey, I'm hungry.

627
00:43:47.917 --> 00:43:49.001
Are you sure?

628
00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:52.004
I could eat the ass
out of a dead rhinoceros.

629
00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:57.176
We got a smooth one?

630
00:43:57.218 --> 00:43:58.427
By the numbers so far.

631
00:43:58.511 --> 00:44:02.056
We just ran a minimum load
test on the cooling system...

632
00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:06.894
- See you
tomorrow. - Take care.

633
00:44:20.116 --> 00:44:23.077
It's too bad we can't
demonstrate this on TV.

634
00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:25.413
What a shame.

635
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:34.213
Overboard dump coming up.

636
00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:39.302
Here it comes,

637
00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:41.345
the constellation Urion.

638
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:47.476
<i>Now, that's a beautiful sight.</i>

639
00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.439
Barbara, we are going
to your father's broadcast.

640
00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.941
No!
I'm never coming out!

641
00:44:54.483 --> 00:44:58.696
I hate Paul! No one else can
ever play their records again!

642
00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:01.908
She's still going on about
the stupid Beatles breaking up?

643
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:04.660
They're not stupid!
You're stupid!

644
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:05.762
I know you're in mourning.

645
00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:08.623
I'm not going, Mom! Dad
won't know if we're there!

646
00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:13.336
The whole world is going to be
watching this broadcast, and so are we.

647
00:45:16.797 --> 00:45:18.799
<i>Good evening, America,</i>

648
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.385
<i>and welcome aboard</i> Apollo 13.

649
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:25.848
<i>I'm Jim Lovell, and we're
broadcasting to you tonight</i>

650
00:45:25.932 --> 00:45:29.894
<i>from an altitude
of almost 200, 000 miles</i>

651
00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:32.480
<i>away from the face of the Earth,</i>

652
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:35.650
<i>and we have a pretty good show
in store for you tonight.</i>

653
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:38.486
<i>We are going to
show you just what</i>

654
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:41.364
<i>life is like for
the three of us here</i>

655
00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:43.866
<i>in the vast expanse
of outer space.</i>

656
00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:47.036
<i>One of the first things
we'd like to do</i>

657
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:50.414
is provide you with the
appropriate background music.

658
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.709
So, hit it there, Freddo.

659
00:46:09.684 --> 00:46:13.562
<i>That was supposed to
be the theme to</i> 2001

660
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:16.274
<i>in honor of our
command module, Odyssey.</i>

661
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:20.069
There seems to have been a
last-minute change in the program.

662
00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:21.988
When I go up on <i>19,</i>
I'm gonna take

663
00:46:22.029 --> 00:46:24.657
my entire collection
of Johnny Cash along.

664
00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:31.372
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where's their broadcast?

665
00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:34.542
All the networks dumped us.

666
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.002
One said we made
going to the moon

667
00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:38.546
as exciting as a
trip to Pittsburgh.

668
00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:43.009
My son's supposed to be on.

669
00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:45.136
He's in outer space.

670
00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:50.224
This is all the channels
we get, Mrs. Lovell.

671
00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:54.312
It's that damn <i>TV Guide</i> again.

672
00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:56.939
<i>Ruthless porters.</i>

673
00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.233
<i>Savage baggage masters...</i>

674
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.082
Do they know
they're not on the air?

675
00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:18.336
We'll tell them
when they get back.

676
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.968
<i>If anyone from
the IRS is watching,</i>

677
00:47:26.052 --> 00:47:29.805
<i>I forgot to file my 1040 return.</i>

678
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:31.932
<i>I meant to do it today...</i>

679
00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:34.518
That's no joke.
They'll jump on him.

680
00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:40.066
Well, folks, let's head on down
to the lunar excursion module.

681
00:47:40.107 --> 00:47:41.442
Follow me.

682
00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:44.278
When we get ready
to land on the moon,

683
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.449
Fred Haise and I will float
through this access tunnel

684
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:50.451
into the lunar module,
leaving...

685
00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:53.621
EECOM, that stir's gonna be

686
00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.957
on both H2 and both
02 tanks, is that correct?

687
00:47:57.249 --> 00:48:00.169
...the spacecraft
will remain connected.

688
00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:04.507
Well, folks,
as you can probably tell,

689
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.927
the Aquarius isn't much bigger
than a couple of telephone booths.

690
00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.679
The skin of the LEM
in some places

691
00:48:10.763 --> 00:48:15.476
is only as thick as
a couple of layers

692
00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:19.146
of tinfoil, and that's all that protects
us from the vacuum of space.

693
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.940
<i>We get away with this
because the LEM</i>

694
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:23.818
is designed only for
flight in outer space.

695
00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.987
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

696
00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:32.493
We'll head back up the tunnel
now and back into the Odyssey.

697
00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:40.793
All right,
we've returned to the...

698
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.296
Stand by one, Houston.

699
00:48:44.964 --> 00:48:46.173
Gotcha!

700
00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:51.220
Houston, that bang you heard was
Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

701
00:48:51.303 --> 00:48:54.515
He gets our hearts going
every time with that one.

702
00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:01.105
We're about to close
out the Aquarius

703
00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:04.275
and return to the Odyssey.

704
00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:09.363
Our next broadcast will be from
Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.

705
00:49:10.865 --> 00:49:13.951
<i>So, this is the crew
of the</i> Apollo 13

706
00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:17.288
<i>wishing everyone back on Earth</i>

707
00:49:19.165 --> 00:49:20.875
<i>a pleasant evening.</i>

708
00:49:24.712 --> 00:49:26.547
All right.

709
00:49:28.674 --> 00:49:30.634
Daddy was funny.

710
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:33.137
They might air a few
minutes on the news tonight.

711
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.722
You'd think so.

712
00:49:36.724 --> 00:49:37.808
Bye.

713
00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:42.313
Well, between Jack's back
taxes and the Fred Haise show,

714
00:49:43.355 --> 00:49:46.275
I'd say that was a pretty
successful broadcast.

715
00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:48.444
<i>That was an excellent show.</i>

716
00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:49.778
Thank you very much, Houston.

717
00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:52.490
We've got a couple of
housekeeping procedures.

718
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:56.869
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

719
00:49:57.244 --> 00:50:00.414
Roger that.
Rolling right, 0-6-0.

720
00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:08.923
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

721
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:11.383
Roger that.

722
00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:46.669
We've got a problem here.

723
00:50:48.128 --> 00:50:49.129
What did you do?

724
00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:50.333
Nothing.
I stirred the tanks.

725
00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:58.556
This is Houston.
Say again, please.

726
00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.182
Houston, we have a problem.

727
00:51:01.976 --> 00:51:04.186
We have a main bus B undervolt.

728
00:51:04.645 --> 00:51:06.039
We've got a lot of
thruster activity.

729
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:07.314
What's with the computer?

730
00:51:07.398 --> 00:51:10.818
It just went off line.
There's another master alarm.

731
00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:12.963
- I'm checking the quad.
- That was no repress valve.

732
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:16.240
Maybe it's in quad C.
I'll reconfigure the RCS.

733
00:51:16.323 --> 00:51:18.200
We've got a ping light.

734
00:51:18.284 --> 00:51:20.494
We've got multiple
caution and warnings.

735
00:51:20.578 --> 00:51:22.162
We've got to reset and restart.

736
00:51:22.204 --> 00:51:23.831
I'm going to SCS.

737
00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:29.753
Flight, their heart rates
are skyrocketing.

738
00:51:29.837 --> 00:51:31.380
EECOM, what's your
data telling you?

739
00:51:31.463 --> 00:51:33.507
02 tank two not reading at all.

740
00:51:33.591 --> 00:51:37.094
Tank one is at
725 psi and falling.

741
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:39.805
Fuel cells one and three are...

742
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:43.225
What's going on? Flight,
let me get back to you.

743
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:46.604
Flight, GNC.
They're all over the place.

744
00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:48.039
They keep going
close to gimbal lock.

745
00:51:48.063 --> 00:51:49.607
I keep losing radio signal.

746
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.609
Their antennae must
be flipped around.

747
00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:53.527
They'll have to do it
manually, if at all.

748
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:55.446
One at a time, people.

749
00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:59.199
Is this an instrumentation
problem or real power loss?

750
00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:02.286
It's reading a quadruple
failure. That can't happen.

751
00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:03.704
It's got to be instrumentation.

752
00:52:04.204 --> 00:52:06.749
Get the hatch plugged. A
meteor may have hit the LEM.

753
00:52:06.832 --> 00:52:10.377
The tunnel's really
torquing with all this movement.

754
00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:14.381
Houston, we had a pretty large
bang associated with a master alarm.

755
00:52:14.423 --> 00:52:16.008
Shit, it's main bus A.

756
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.635
<i>Main bus A undervolt?</i>

757
00:52:17.718 --> 00:52:20.471
Main bus A undervolt down to...

758
00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:25.059
It's reading 25-and-a-half.
Main bus B is reading zip now.

759
00:52:25.351 --> 00:52:27.061
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

760
00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:30.397
These guys are talking
about bangs and shimmies.

761
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:32.232
Doesn't sound like
instrumentation.

762
00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:33.525
<i>You are breaking up.</i>

763
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:34.836
Can't get this hatch to seal.

764
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.365
Just stow it. If we'd been hit by
a meteor, we'd be dead by now.

765
00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:41.217
I'm gonna try to
get us out of this.

766
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:44.078
Houston, did you say
switch to omni bravo?

767
00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:45.537
<i>Roger that,</i> 13.

768
00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:47.247
The signal
strength went way down.

769
00:52:47.331 --> 00:52:49.124
It's fighting me.
What's the story?

770
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:50.876
We keep flirting
with gimbal lock.

771
00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:54.505
<i>We need a
confirmation. What systems are down?</i>

772
00:52:57.216 --> 00:52:59.176
SMRCS, Helium one...

773
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:01.428
A and C are barber pole.

774
00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:04.598
Houston, I'm switching
over Quad C to main A.

775
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:05.766
Roger that, 13.

776
00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:08.936
Okay, Houston, fuel
cell one, fuel cell three.

777
00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:13.899
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

778
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:18.278
What don't we have?
AC bus one, AC bus two.

779
00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:21.990
Command module computer.
02 flow high.

780
00:53:22.324 --> 00:53:24.618
It may be a caution
and warning failure.

781
00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:29.081
Houston, we are venting
something out into space.

782
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:34.002
<i>I can see it outside
window one right now.</i>

783
00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:40.050
<i>It's definitely
a gas of some sort.</i>

784
00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:44.805
It's got to be the oxygen.

785
00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:04.825
Roger, Odyssey.
We copy your venting.

786
00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:05.969
Give me an alignment.

787
00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:08.662
Let's think about
things we can connect.

788
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:11.123
Let's start back
at the beginning.

789
00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:25.846
Listen up.
Quiet down, people.

790
00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:30.434
Quiet down!

791
00:54:30.642 --> 00:54:32.644
Let's stay cool, people.

792
00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:35.564
Procedures, I need another
computer up in the RTCC.

793
00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:38.192
I want everybody to
alert your support teams.

794
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:41.236
Wake up anybody you need
and get them in here.

795
00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:43.530
Let's work the problem, people.

796
00:54:43.572 --> 00:54:45.699
Let's not make things
worse by guessing.

797
00:54:45.783 --> 00:54:46.926
<i>CAPCOM 1:13, this is Houston.</i>

798
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.287
<i>We're going around the room.
We'll get you answers.</i>

799
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:54.166
<i>We keep venting, we're gonna
keep hitting the edge of that deadband.</i>

800
00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:56.710
Take a look
at the 02 on number one.

801
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.217
200 pounds and falling.

802
00:55:04.343 --> 00:55:06.220
02 tank two still zero.

803
00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:08.347
Tank one, 218 psi and falling.

804
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:09.991
<i>Is that what
you're getting? Confirm.</i>

805
00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:12.518
We're seeing the same, 13.

806
00:55:13.227 --> 00:55:14.770
Can we review our status, Sy?

807
00:55:14.853 --> 00:55:19.024
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

808
00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:26.406
What have we got on
the spacecraft that's good?

809
00:55:28.242 --> 00:55:30.244
I'll get back to you, Gene.

810
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.249
We're not gonna have
power much longer.

811
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:37.543
The ship's bleeding to death.

812
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.301
Flight?

813
00:55:46.385 --> 00:55:48.262
<i>Yeah. Go, EECOM.</i>

814
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:52.808
Um, Flight, I recommend we shut
down the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

815
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:56.311
What the hell good
is that gonna do?

816
00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:59.147
If the leak's there,
we can isolate it.

817
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:02.609
We can save what's left in the
tanks, and run on the good cell.

818
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.128
You close them, you
can't open them again.

819
00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:06.905
You can't land on
the moon with one cell.

820
00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:10.450
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

821
00:56:11.285 --> 00:56:14.204
From my chair here,
this is the last option.

822
00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:24.006
Yeah. Okay, Sy.

823
00:56:39.688 --> 00:56:42.900
Capcom, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

824
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:44.735
<i>13,</i> this is Houston.

825
00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:48.614
We want you to close react
valves on cells one and three.

826
00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:50.782
Do you copy?

827
00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.745
Are you saying you
want the whole smash?

828
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:58.248
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shutdown?

829
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:02.461
Shutting down the fuel
cells? Did I hear you right?

830
00:57:03.128 --> 00:57:05.172
Yeah, they heard me right.

831
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.551
Tell them we think that's the
only way they can stop the leak.

832
00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:10.844
Yeah, Jim,

833
00:57:10.928 --> 00:57:14.473
<i>we think that closing the
react valves may stop the leak.</i>

834
00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:25.609
Did he copy that?

835
00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:27.319
Do you copy, Jim?

836
00:57:29.529 --> 00:57:31.365
Yes, Houston, we copy.

837
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.997
We just lost the moon.

838
00:57:48.757 --> 00:57:50.968
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

839
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.972
Let's see what this does.

840
00:58:03.397 --> 00:58:05.190
If this doesn't work,

841
00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:08.735
we're not gonna have
enough power left to get home.

842
00:58:26.086 --> 00:58:27.379
Shit!

843
00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:28.755
God damn it!

844
00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:32.009
Houston, 02 on one
is still falling.

845
00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:37.597
How long does it take
to power up the LEM?

846
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:39.891
Three hours by the checklist.

847
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.561
We don't have that much time.

848
00:58:42.602 --> 00:58:43.729
Shit!

849
00:58:45.814 --> 00:58:48.859
Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here,

850
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:51.028
let's power down everything

851
00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:54.197
so we can save as much
as we can for re-entry.

852
00:58:54.781 --> 00:58:56.616
Fifteen minutes
of oxygen, that's it.

853
00:58:56.658 --> 00:58:58.285
The command module will be dead.

854
00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:01.288
Okay, guys, listen up.
Here's the drill.

855
00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:03.457
We're moving the
astronauts to the LEM.

856
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.250
We've got to get
oxygen up there.

857
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:09.713
TELMU, Control, I want emergency
power procedure. Essential hardware only.

858
00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:13.508
GNC, EECOM, we'll be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

859
00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:16.303
We've to transfer the guidance
system to another computer.

860
00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:19.389
I want those numbers up and
ready when they're in position.

861
00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:22.309
Transfer all data
over the LEM computer

862
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:23.810
before the command module dies.

863
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:26.396
The lunar module
just became a lifeboat.

864
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.358
Odyssey, this is Houston. We
need you to power down immediately.

865
00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:34.237
<i>Power up the LEM at the same
time, so get somebody over there.</i>

866
00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:36.823
We already have
Freddo in the LEM.

867
00:59:36.865 --> 00:59:38.992
<i>We've got serious time pressure.</i>

868
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:41.578
<i>Get the guidance
program transferred</i>

869
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:44.372
<i>before you're out of power
in the command module,</i>

870
00:59:44.456 --> 00:59:47.000
<i>or you're not gonna
be able to navigate.</i>

871
00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:48.877
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

872
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.131
We're looking at less than 15
minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

873
00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.514
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
It's worse than I thought.

874
01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:05.769
<i>Houston, I've moved from the
command module into the LEM.</i>

875
01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:10.649
If Jack can't get that data
transferred before they go dead...

876
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.026
They won't know which
way they're pointed.

877
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.194
That's a bad way to fly.

878
01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.570
I'll be in 210 if you need me.

879
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:21.326
<i>Houston, this is 13.
Are you back with me now?</i>

880
01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.055
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

881
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.498
<i>You now have about
12 minutes to power up.</i>

882
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:31.211
I can't see any stars. Man, there's a
lot of debris floating around out there.

883
01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.132
Houston, I have completed
the steps on Page 15.

884
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.717
I'm ready to
power down the computer.

885
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:40.554
I'm gonna need
your gimbal angles, Jack,

886
01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:43.014
before you shut down
the computer!

887
01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:44.641
Okay, Jim.

888
01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.685
I need this back
before they power down.

889
01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.854
All right, I got it.
Hold on.

890
01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:51.898
Houston, our computer is up.

891
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.984
<i>Roger. Stand by.</i>

892
01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:58.405
<i>Jack, we need to proceed
with steps 12 through 17 quickly.</i>

893
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.950
<i>You're down to about
eight minutes remaining.</i>

894
01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:05.745
Fuel cell pump's off.
02 fans, tank two off.

895
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:09.749
Okay, Houston, check me. I have
completed the gimbal conversions

896
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.128
but I need a double check
of the arithmetic.

897
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.172
Yeah, you can go, Jim.

898
01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:17.591
The roll CAL angle is minus two.

899
01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:21.428
<i>Lunar module roll
is 355.57.</i>

900
01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:25.015
<i>Pitch, 1678, correction.</i>

901
01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:28.101
<i>Pitch, 167.78.</i>

902
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.812
<i>Yaw is 351.87.</i>

903
01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:32.272
Stand by.
We're checking it.

904
01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.816
<i>We've got negative
visibility in our star field,</i>

905
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:39.279
<i>and if this paperwork isn't right, who
knows where we'll end up out here.</i>

906
01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:48.121
Looks good, Flight.

907
01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:49.289
It's all right.

908
01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.373
Good here.

909
01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:51.458
He's good, Andy.

910
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.918
We'll go on those numbers.

911
01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.312
<i>- You're good.</i>
- Log them in, Freddo.

912
01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.963
<i>Turn off
the IMU. Switch to SCS.</i>

913
01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.299
<i>Stand by. Over.</i>

914
01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:03.511
<i>It's a great day in New York.
It's girl watchers' weather.</i>

915
01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:06.389
<i>I like the ingenious girl watchers
who wear Con Edison helmets</i>

916
01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:10.101
<i>and dig trenches in the
street to get a better view.</i>

917
01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:12.520
<i>But speaking of girl watching,</i>

918
01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.982
<i>did you know that our first bachelor
astronaut is on his way to the moon?</i>

919
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.693
<i>Is it Swigert?
Yeah, first bachelor.</i>

920
01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:23.114
<i>They say he's the kind who has a girl
in every port. He has that reputation.</i>

921
01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:25.158
<i>He's sort of
foolishly optimistic,</i>

922
01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:27.327
<i>taking nylons and
Hershey bars to the moon.</i>

923
01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.082
<i>Did you read that
three million...</i>

924
01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.793
<i>What do you say? Less
viewers or fewer viewers?</i>

925
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:38.505
<i>Three million fewer viewers</i>

926
01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:41.508
<i>watched the space shot
than did the last one.</i>

927
01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.391
<i>Here is ABC science
editor Jules Bergman.</i>

928
01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:53.770
<i>The</i> Apollo 13 <i>spacecraft
has lost all electrical power,</i>

929
01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.481
<i>astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert</i>

930
01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:59.234
<i>are making their way
to the lunar module</i>

931
01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:01.861
<i>using it as a lifeboat so
they'll have electrical power</i>

932
01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.863
<i>for their radios
on the command module.</i>

933
01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.866
Apollo 13 <i>is apparently also
losing breathing oxygen...</i>

934
01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:10.412
Slow down. An "electrical failure."
What exactly does that mean?

935
01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:13.290
<i>The emergency has
ruled out any chance of a lunar landing</i>

936
01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:16.126
<i>and could endanger the
lives of the astronauts</i>

937
01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:20.463
<i>if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever
is left of the command module's oxygen</i>

938
01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.841
<i>can't last them until they
can get back to Earth.</i>

939
01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:24.442
What do you mean,
"no immediate danger"?

940
01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.429
I heard they're losing oxygen.
Can they get back?

941
01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:31.224
<i>The LEM's descent rocket
engine will be used in aborting the mission</i>

942
01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:33.810
<i>and getting them
safely back to Earth.</i>

943
01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.478
<i>Recapping what has happened.</i>

944
01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.565
<i>The</i> Apollo 13 <i>astronauts
may be in grave danger.</i>

945
01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.400
No, don't give me
that NASA bullshit!

946
01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.569
I want to know what's
happening with my husband!

947
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.988
<i>We want to switch
control to the Aquarius now.</i>

948
01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.823
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!

949
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.993
<i>You're down
to about five minutes now.</i>

950
01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.579
Be aware our RCS
isn't up here yet.

951
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.914
<i>We have no attitude control
on Aquarius.</i>

952
01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:58.752
They don't have control?
Did we miss a step here?

953
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.754
Control, what the hell happened?

954
01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.505
I don't know.
We need more time.

955
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.927
<i>We're out of whack.</i>

956
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.263
I'm trying to pitch down
but we're yawing to the left.

957
01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.307
Why can't I null this out?

958
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.518
<i>She wasn't designed
to fly attached like this.</i>

959
01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:19.439
It's like flying with a dead
elephant on our back.

960
01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.275
Flight, Guidance. We're
getting close to center here.

961
01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:25.153
Watch that middle gimbal. We
don't want you tumbling off into space.

962
01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:28.448
Inform them I'm well aware
of the goddamn gimbals!

963
01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:30.784
Roger that.

964
01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:31.886
<i>I don't need
to hear the obvious.</i>

965
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.095
<i>I can see the
frapping eight-ball!</i>

966
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.704
Andy, we're on VOX.

967
01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:38.083
Aquarius, this is
Houston. We've got you both on VOX.

968
01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.377
<i>You want us to go to VOX?</i>

969
01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:43.797
<i>You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.</i>

970
01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.215
Sorry, Jim.

971
01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.135
<i>It's only by
a very narrow margin</i>

972
01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:53.139
<i>that we're going to get Lovell,
Haise and Swigert back alive.</i>

973
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.145
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey's calling for you.

974
01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:03.274
<i>...the terseness of
Kraft and the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.</i>

975
01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.151
<i>This has been a very close call.</i>

976
01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.487
<i>We're not out of the woods yet.</i>

977
01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.539
Why are so many people here?

978
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.420
Your dad's flying his mission.

979
01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:29.134
He said he was going
to get me a moon rock.

980
01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.552
Right.

981
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.644
Something broke on
your daddy's spaceship,

982
01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:45.233
and he's gonna have to turn around
before he even gets to the moon.

983
01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:51.072
Was it the door?

984
01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.994
<i>CAPCOM 1:13, we still show
that venting pushing you around.</i>

985
01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.120
<i>How you doing?</i>

986
01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:59.038
<i>Houston, Aquarius.</i>

987
01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:03.543
We've had to learn how to fly all
over again, but we are doing better now.

988
01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.879
Roger that, Aquarius.

989
01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:07.881
Have him close it out.

990
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:11.634
<i>Jack, we can
close out your procedure now.</i>

991
01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:16.598
Do we know for sure that we
can power this thing back up?

992
01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.809
<i>It's gonna get
awfully cold in here.</i>

993
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:24.397
<i>Copy that, Jack.
We'll just have to deal with that later.</i>

994
01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:28.443
Computer off.

995
01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:29.569
We're clear.

996
01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.905
We're going to the LEM.

997
01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.741
We confirm shutdown, Jack.

998
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.951
<i>Lunar module now in control.</i>

999
01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:46.085
<i>Roger that, Houston.
This is Odyssey signing off.</i>

1000
01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:05.104
Freddo, we're gonna have
to execute some sort of burn.

1001
01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:07.273
It's just a matter of when.

1002
01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.571
Did they shut us
all down in there?

1003
01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:14.989
Yeah.

1004
01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:19.035
Didn't think we'd
be back in here so soon.

1005
01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:24.290
Houston, how far off course
do you project we are? Over.

1006
01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.546
Okay, people, listen up!

1007
01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:32.924
Gentlemen, I want you all
to forget the flight plan.

1008
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.178
From this moment on, we
are improvising a new mission.

1009
01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:43.518
Sorry about that.
We'll get somebody to look at that.

1010
01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.812
How do we get our people home?

1011
01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:49.691
They are here.

1012
01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.085
Do we turn them around,
direct abort?

1013
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:52.151
Yes!

1014
01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:59.784
No, sir! We get them on
a free-return trajectory.

1015
01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:02.203
It's the option with the fewest
question marks for safety.

1016
01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:05.415
I agree. We use the moon's
gravity to slingshot them around.

1017
01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:09.168
No, the LEM will not support
three guys for that amount of time.

1018
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.838
I think we've got to
do a direct abort.

1019
01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:14.215
We do an about-face,
bring the guys right home.

1020
01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:15.883
Get them back soon.
Absolutely.

1021
01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:18.261
We don't even know if the
Odyssey's engine's working.

1022
01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.388
If there's been serious
damage to the craft...

1023
01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:21.806
They blow up and they die!

1024
01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:24.392
That is not the argument!
We're talking about time!

1025
01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:25.977
Not whether these guys...

1026
01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:27.687
I'm not gonna
sugarcoat this for you!

1027
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.148
Okay, hold it.
Let's hold it down.

1028
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:33.651
The only engine we've got with
enough power for a direct abort

1029
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.862
is the SPS on
the service module.

1030
01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:38.406
It could have been damaged
in an explosion,

1031
01:08:38.489 --> 01:08:40.283
so let's consider
that engine dead.

1032
01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.368
We light it up, could
blow the whole works.

1033
01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:45.330
Just too risky. We're not
gonna take that chance.

1034
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.790
The only thing the command
module's good for is re-entry.

1035
01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:51.753
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

1036
01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:54.172
Once we get the guys
around the moon,

1037
01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:56.549
we'll fire up the LEM
engine, make a long burn,

1038
01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:59.302
pick up some speed, and get
them home as quick as we can.

1039
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:03.014
Gene, I'm wondering what the
Grumman guys think about this.

1040
01:09:03.222 --> 01:09:05.433
We can't make any guarantees.

1041
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:07.518
We designed the LEM
to land on the moon,

1042
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.729
not fire the engine
for course corrections.

1043
01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:13.608
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

1044
01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.612
I don't care what anything
was designed to do.

1045
01:09:17.695 --> 01:09:19.781
I care about what it can do.

1046
01:09:19.864 --> 01:09:22.784
So let's get to work.
Let's lay it out, okay?

1047
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.996
Capcom, Flight, he says
it will be ready in time.

1048
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:31.167
{\an8}After this burn, we've got to build time
in the flight plan for them to get sleep.

1049
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.919
{\an8}Run it by the FAO.

1050
01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.295
I've run it by the FAO.

1051
01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.065
Do we know how
long we're gonna fire that burn?

1052
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.758
He wanted a quote
from a flight director.

1053
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.051
Who wanted a quote?

1054
01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.761
- The President.
- The President?

1055
01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.846
Nixon.
He wants our odds.

1056
01:09:45.431 --> 01:09:47.517
We are not losing the crew.

1057
01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.244
Gene, I gotta give him odds.

1058
01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:50.770
Five to one against?
Three to one?

1059
01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:51.914
I don't think they're that good.

1060
01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:54.107
We are not losing those men.

1061
01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:02.990
How long are they
gonna have to burn the engine PC + 2?

1062
01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:05.243
Look, tell him three to one.

1063
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:11.165
<i>Expect loss of
signal in less than one minute.</i>

1064
01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:14.335
<i>When we pick you back up we
will have your PC</i> + <i>2 burn data.</i>

1065
01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:15.753
Okay.
Roger that, Houston.

1066
01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:19.090
We'll hear from you again
at acquisition of signal.

1067
01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.553
You wanna look?

1068
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.598
Oh, look at that.

1069
01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:39.318
<i>Aquarius, that's
30 seconds until loss of signal.</i>

1070
01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.324
Mare Tranquillitatis.

1071
01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.537
Neil and Buzz's
old neighborhood.

1072
01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:52.540
Coming up on Mount Marilyn.

1073
01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.418
Jim, you gotta
take a look at this.

1074
01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.629
I've seen it.

1075
01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.512
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1076
01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:10.016
<i>We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.</i>

1077
01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:14.687
<i>So long, Earth.
Catch you on the flip side.</i>

1078
01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.821
<i>When you go into
the shadow of the moon</i>

1079
01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.699
<i>and the moon is
between you and the sun,</i>

1080
01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.660
<i>you see stars that
are more brilliant</i>

1081
01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:30.888
<i>than anything you've ever seen</i>

1082
01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.997
<i>on the clearest nights
here on Earth.</i>

1083
01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:38.127
<i>And then you pass into the lunar
sunrise over the lunar surface.</i>

1084
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.672
<i>It must be
an awe-inspiring sight.</i>

1085
01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.716
<i>I can't wait to see it myself.</i>

1086
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.387
<i>The problem now is not so much a
question of adequate oxygen supply,</i>

1087
01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.389
<i>but it is the rate of
consumption of water</i>

1088
01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:53.559
<i>which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations</i>

1089
01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.895
<i>to maintain the
electronic systems...</i>

1090
01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.602
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

1091
01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.565
I can see our landing site.

1092
01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:47.113
Look at the Tsiolkovsky Crater.

1093
01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:52.159
I can't believe how bright
the ejecta blanket is.

1094
01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:55.121
It's like snow.
It's beautiful.

1095
01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.500
That's Mare Imbrium
to the north.

1096
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.774
<i>13, this is Houston.</i>

1097
01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:08.402
<i>We're reading your telemetry.
It's good to see you again.</i>

1098
01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.322
Good to see you, too, Houston.

1099
01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:15.660
<i>We are picking you up
at a velocity of 7, 062 feet per second,</i>

1100
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:19.372
<i>at a distance from the moon
of 56 nautical miles.</i>

1101
01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:21.958
<i>Stand by for
your PC</i> + <i>2 burn data.</i>

1102
01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:26.212
Got to tell you, I had
an itch to take this baby down,

1103
01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.047
do some prospecting.

1104
01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.800
Damn, we were close.

1105
01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:36.097
Gentlemen, what
are your intentions?

1106
01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.186
I'd like to go home.

1107
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:47.066
We got a burn coming up.

1108
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.903
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1109
01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:54.407
Let's get an idea where we
stand on the consumables.

1110
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.243
Jack, get into the Odyssey

1111
01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:01.038
and bag up all the water you
can before it freezes in there.

1112
01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:04.500
Let's go home.

1113
01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:08.254
<i>Aquarius, we got
some PC + 2 burn data for you fellas.</i>

1114
01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:13.509
So you're telling me you can
only give our guys 45 hours?

1115
01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:16.429
That brings them to about there.

1116
01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:22.768
Gentlemen,
that's not acceptable.

1117
01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.730
Gene, we've
got to talk about power.

1118
01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.274
Guys! Power
is everything!

1119
01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:30.484
Power is everything.

1120
01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:31.986
What do you mean?

1121
01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:34.822
Without it, they don't talk
to us, correct their trajectory,

1122
01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:37.116
they don't turn
the heat shield around.

1123
01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:39.577
We gotta turn
everything off. Now.

1124
01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.746
They're not gonna
make it to re-entry.

1125
01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:42.931
What do you mean, "everything"?

1126
01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:45.499
If everything's on,
the LEM draws 60 amps.

1127
01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:49.128
At that rate, in 16 hours the
batteries are dead, not 45.

1128
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.465
And so is the crew. We gotta
get them down to 12 amps.

1129
01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:54.133
- Twelve amps?
- How many?

1130
01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:56.510
You can't run a vacuum
cleaner on 12 amps, John.

1131
01:15:56.594 --> 01:16:00.514
We gotta turn off
the radars, cabin heater,

1132
01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:02.767
instrument displays,
guidance computer, everything.

1133
01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:05.728
Guidance computer? What if
they need to do another burn?

1134
01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.330
They won't know which
way they're pointed.

1135
01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:09.648
The more time we talk,
the more juice they waste.

1136
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.126
I've looked at data
for the past hour.

1137
01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.151
That's the deal?

1138
01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.819
That's the deal.

1139
01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:23.329
Okay, John. The minute we finish
the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1140
01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.747
All right.

1141
01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.416
Now, in the meantime,

1142
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.294
we're gonna have a frozen
command module up there.

1143
01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:31.837
Soon, we'll have to power it up

1144
01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.315
using nothing but
the re-entry batteries.

1145
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:34.673
That's never been tried before.

1146
01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.301
We've never even
simulated it before.

1147
01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:39.887
Well, we're gonna
have to figure it out.

1148
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:43.349
I want people in our simulators
working re-entry scenarios.

1149
01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.560
I want you to find every engineer
who designed every switch, circuit,

1150
01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.187
transistor and
light bulb up there.

1151
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:52.066
Then, talk to the guy in the assembly
line who actually built the thing.

1152
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:56.487
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1153
01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:01.117
I want this mark all the way
back to Earth with time to spare.

1154
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.744
We never lost an
American in space.

1155
01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.372
We're sure as hell not
gonna lose one on my watch.

1156
01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.040
Failure is not an option.

1157
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.717
What?

1158
01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.553
Good, you're not dead.

1159
01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:23.222
I've been trying to get in
touch with you for 45 minutes.

1160
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.890
Jesus, what're you doing here?

1161
01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:27.143
I gotta get you in the
simulator. We got a ship to land.

1162
01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.227
What?

1163
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.728
There's been an explosion.

1164
01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:33.732
Oxygen tanks are gone, two fuel cells
gone, command module's shut down.

1165
01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:34.900
What about the crew?

1166
01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:35.943
Crew's fine so far.

1167
01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:38.195
Trying to keep them
alive in the LEM.

1168
01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.240
We'll have to shut that
down pretty soon, too.

1169
01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:44.285
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one.

1170
01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:47.079
Nobody's too sure how much
power we'll have for re-entry.

1171
01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:50.708
The command module will be
frozen up pretty good by then.

1172
01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:55.045
If you see this ammeter rise over
20 at any point, power-up is no good.

1173
01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:57.232
If it spikes, that's <i>sayonara</i>
for the guidance computer.

1174
01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:59.216
Our guys can't re-enter, okay?

1175
01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.635
How much power
do we have to play with?

1176
01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.388
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours. Go.

1177
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.182
<i>Ken Mattingly just got here.</i>

1178
01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:07.850
Copy. He's here.

1179
01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:10.978
They've been
losing heat since the accident.

1180
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:13.689
They'll start getting water
condensation on the control panels.

1181
01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:15.774
Glad you're here. You
know what's going on?

1182
01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.234
John's brought me up to speed.

1183
01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.652
What's left in the batteries?

1184
01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:19.778
We don't know.

1185
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.072
We gotta get started on
some shortcuts for power-up.

1186
01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:23.741
You know how short?

1187
01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:27.620
It's all in the sequencing. If we can
skip whatever we don't absolutely need,

1188
01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.222
turn things on in
the right order, maybe...

1189
01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:30.289
I agree.

1190
01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.457
You started on a procedure?

1191
01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.834
Engineers have tried,
but it's your ship.

1192
01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:35.252
We gotta get you in there.

1193
01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:36.545
Okay.

1194
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:39.423
Frank, I need the
sim cold and dark.

1195
01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.842
Give me the exact conditions
they've got in there now.

1196
01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:44.178
I need status of
every instrument.

1197
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.680
- You got it.
- I need a flashlight.

1198
01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:47.991
That's not what
they have up there.

1199
01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:49.934
Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

1200
01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:52.256
Let's get this show on the
road. Put him in space, fellas.

1201
01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:58.692
Okay, Houston, the quad-heater
circuit breakers are open.

1202
01:18:58.776 --> 01:18:59.777
<i>Copy that.</i>

1203
01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:02.404
We'll use the forward omni
when the Earth's in the window,

1204
01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:05.449
and we're switching to aft
omni when we see the moon.

1205
01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:07.159
<i>We copy that,</i> 13.

1206
01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.828
<i>Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.</i>

1207
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.373
<i>The venting may
push you off course.</i>

1208
01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:14.833
Oh, Christ.

1209
01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:15.918
What's up?

1210
01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:19.838
No more waste dumps. We're
just gonna have to store it.

1211
01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:23.175
Jack, we're gonna need
some more urine bags.

1212
01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:27.012
Okay, Houston, that
leaves us with just the computer,

1213
01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.682
which I'm shutting down now.

1214
01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.190
And that's it.

1215
01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:42.111
We just put Sir Isaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1216
01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:49.493
Is it a.m. or p.m.?

1217
01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:52.997
A.m. Very, very a.m.

1218
01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:55.541
Haise is running a temperature,
and no one has slept.

1219
01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:59.545
I can't order these guys to go to
sleep. Could you sleep up there?

1220
01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:02.798
It's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1221
01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:07.344
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1222
01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.805
We got a CO2 filter problem
on the lunar module.

1223
01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:11.223
Five filters on the LEM.

1224
01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:14.226
Meant for two guys for a
day and a half. I told the doc...

1225
01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:15.769
We're up to eight on the gauges.

1226
01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:19.189
Anything over 15 and you get
impaired judgment, blackouts,

1227
01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.983
the beginnings
of brain asphyxia.

1228
01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.627
What about scrubbers
in the command module?

1229
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.712
They take square cartridges.

1230
01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:25.696
The ones on the LEM are round.

1231
01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.700
Tell me this isn't
a government operation.

1232
01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:32.578
This just isn't a contingency
we've remotely looked at.

1233
01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.080
Those CO2
levels will be getting toxic.

1234
01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.623
I suggest you
gentlemen invent a way

1235
01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:39.835
to put a square peg
in a round hole. Rapidly.

1236
01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.424
Okay, people, listen up!

1237
01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:49.970
The people upstairs have handed us
this one, and we gotta come through.

1238
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.224
We gotta find a way to make this

1239
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.144
fit into the hole for this

1240
01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:00.105
using nothing but that.

1241
01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:03.025
Let's get it organized.

1242
01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:04.461
Okay, let's build a filter.

1243
01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:07.112
Better get some
coffee going, too.

1244
01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:10.407
<i>The Haise
family lives in El Lago, Texas.</i>

1245
01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:13.410
<i>His wife, Mary,
is from Biloxi, Mississippi.</i>

1246
01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:15.329
<i>When Fred Haise was
growing up in Biloxi,</i>

1247
01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:17.623
<i>he may have looked
ahead to a fine family,</i>

1248
01:21:17.664 --> 01:21:19.124
<i>but he never dreamt of flying.</i>

1249
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.960
<i>I'd never flown before
I went into the service,</i>

1250
01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:25.672
<i>and I only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission...</i>

1251
01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:27.383
Good morning.

1252
01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:29.593
Henry. Don't you
ever sleep?

1253
01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:32.304
I have a request
from the news people.

1254
01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.389
Uh-huh.

1255
01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:37.851
They're out front here and they want
to put a transmitter up on the lawn.

1256
01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:39.812
Transmitter?

1257
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.065
It's kind of a tower
for a live broadcast.

1258
01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.823
I thought they didn't
care about the mission.

1259
01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:53.158
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1260
01:21:53.659 --> 01:21:56.328
Well, it's more dramatic
now. Suddenly people are...

1261
01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.330
If landing on the moon
wasn't dramatic enough,

1262
01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.707
why should not landing on it be?

1263
01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:04.962
Look, I realize how
hard this is, Marilyn,

1264
01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:07.005
but the whole world
is caught up in it.

1265
01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:08.149
It's the biggest story since...

1266
01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.508
No, Henry.

1267
01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:14.555
Those people don't put one
piece of equipment on my lawn.

1268
01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:18.684
If they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1269
01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.769
He'll be home on Friday.

1270
01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:06.398
Hey, Fred.

1271
01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.984
It's too cold in there.

1272
01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.418
That's a nice one of Mary.

1273
01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:31.548
You don't look too good, Freddo.

1274
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.091
I'll survive.

1275
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.360
There's aspirin
in the medical kit.

1276
01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:36.970
I took some.
Jim, I'm all right.

1277
01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:46.355
It was an accident,
Mary getting pregnant.

1278
01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:51.401
You should have seen the look
on my face when she told me.

1279
01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:55.197
Well, that has
a tendency to happen.

1280
01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:05.123
I wonder if
it's a boy or a girl.

1281
01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.461
You're gonna find out
soon enough.

1282
01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:11.129
Sure.

1283
01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:18.595
I never dreamed I'd ever
get to do something like this.

1284
01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:21.139
Come up here on a real mission.

1285
01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:24.560
Most of the guys I
graduated high school with

1286
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:27.020
never even left home,
and here I am.

1287
01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:28.355
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.358
Here you are.

1289
01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.824
It hurts when I urinate.

1290
01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.219
Well, you're not
getting enough water.

1291
01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.870
I'm drinking my ration
the same as you.

1292
01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:50.168
I think old Swigert
gave me the clap.

1293
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.839
He's been pissing
in my relief tube.

1294
01:24:57.092 --> 01:25:00.804
Well, that will be a hot one at
the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1295
01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:04.850
That's another first for
America's space program.

1296
01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:12.107
Listen, I've been
going over some stuff,

1297
01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:17.362
and I'm a little worried about this
cold affecting our battery efficiency.

1298
01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:22.159
We quit heating the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1299
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.286
It could cost us amp
hours on the back end?

1300
01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:25.746
That's a possibility.

1301
01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.540
I've been going
over the numbers again.

1302
01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:31.311
Have they called up with a re-entry
plan yet? We're coming in too shallow...

1303
01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:33.128
We're working on it.

1304
01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:35.380
I can't remember the
ratio to temperature.

1305
01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.840
We got no references on board.

1306
01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:39.051
Let's see if Houston can
pull up the mil specs...

1307
01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:43.055
Listen, they gave us too much
Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1308
01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:47.476
At this rate we'll skip right out of
the atmosphere, and never get back.

1309
01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:50.562
What are you talking about?
How'd you figure that?

1310
01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:51.980
I can add.

1311
01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.401
Many PhDs are working on this.

1312
01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:57.754
Houston says we're on the money.

1313
01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.280
What if they made a mistake
and there was no way to reverse it?

1314
01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.573
You think they'd tell us?

1315
01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.991
There's no reason to tell us!

1316
01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:04.826
What do you mean?
That's bullshit!

1317
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:07.704
There's 1,000 things that
have to happen in order.

1318
01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:10.290
We are on number eight.

1319
01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:12.918
You're talking about number 692.

1320
01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:15.837
In the meantime, I'm trying to
tell you we're coming in too fast.

1321
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:19.424
I think they know it, and that's
why we don't have a re-entry plan.

1322
01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:21.927
That's duly noted.
Thank you, Jack.

1323
01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:25.055
God damn this piece of shit!

1324
01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.100
This piece of shit's
gonna get you home.

1325
01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:31.728
That's because that's the
only thing we've got left, Jack!

1326
01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:34.231
What are you saying, Fred?

1327
01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:36.608
I think you know
what I'm saying.

1328
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:40.112
Now wait a minute. All I
did was stir those tanks.

1329
01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.964
What was the gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1330
01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:44.116
Don't tell me how to fly the CM!

1331
01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:45.826
They brought me in to do a job!

1332
01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:49.246
They asked me to stir the damn
tanks, and I stirred the tanks!

1333
01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.747
Stop kicking
yourself in the ass.

1334
01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:51.957
This is not my fault!

1335
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.959
No one is saying it is.

1336
01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:57.963
If I'm in the left-hand seat when
the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1337
01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.131
Well, tell him that.

1338
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:02.050
I just asked you what the gauge
was reading, and you don't know!

1339
01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.344
Look, we're not
doing this, gentlemen.

1340
01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:07.222
We're not bouncing off
the walls for 10 minutes

1341
01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:10.350
because we'll just end up
with the same problems!

1342
01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:12.936
Try to figure out
how to stay alive!

1343
01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:15.998
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1344
01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:17.065
Are we on VOX?

1345
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:18.900
No, we're not on VOX.

1346
01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:21.695
Yeah, Houston, this
is Aquarius. Go ahead.

1347
01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:26.283
<i>Yeah, Jim, could
you check your CO2 gauge for us?</i>

1348
01:27:29.453 --> 01:27:31.329
We were just looking at that.

1349
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:35.375
Our CO2 measurement has
jumped four notches in the last hour.

1350
01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:38.670
That can't be right. I went
over those numbers three times.

1351
01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:42.466
<i>Jim, that sounds
about right. We were expecting that.</i>

1352
01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:45.927
That's very comforting to know,
Houston. What do we do about it?

1353
01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:49.806
<i>Jim, we're working
on a procedure down here for you.</i>

1354
01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:53.018
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Oh, Christ.

1355
01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.187
All right, we're standing
by for those procedures.

1356
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.981
Christ, I know why
my numbers are wrong.

1357
01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:01.067
I only figured it
for two people.

1358
01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:07.365
Maybe I should
just hold my breath.

1359
01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:11.203
<i>The deadly CO2 gas
is literally poisoning</i>

1360
01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.163
<i>the astronauts
with every breath in and out.</i>

1361
01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:14.706
Heads up.

1362
01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:18.752
Go.

1363
01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:22.923
Heads up, people.
Look out now.

1364
01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.593
What's this?

1365
01:28:26.676 --> 01:28:28.804
That's what they gotta make.

1366
01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.865
I hope you got
the procedures for me.

1367
01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:31.890
Right here.

1368
01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:33.725
That's it?

1369
01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:38.104
<i>All right,
Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1370
01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:39.981
<i>Do you have
a flight plan up there?</i>

1371
01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:42.984
Affirmative, Andy.
Jack's got one right here.

1372
01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:46.947
Okay, we have an unusual
procedure for you here.

1373
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.115
<i>We need you to
rip the cover off.</i>

1374
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:52.410
He wants you to rip the
cover off the flight plan.

1375
01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.246
With pleasure.

1376
01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:56.164
<i>The other materials you'll need</i>

1377
01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.750
are a lithium
hydroxide canister...

1378
01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:01.586
Two lithium hydroxide
canisters, I'm sorry,

1379
01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:03.088
a roll of gray tape.

1380
01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:04.172
Duct tape.

1381
01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:08.134
<i>Duct tape. You
need an LCG bag... Two LCG bags,</i>

1382
01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:12.180
<i>the red suit hoses, and
you've got the flight plan cover.</i>

1383
01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:20.397
What about their level
of carbon dioxide?

1384
01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:22.065
It's climbing.

1385
01:29:24.317 --> 01:29:26.504
You're saying that they're
almost out of breathable air?

1386
01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:30.615
Wait a second. That's not what
he said. He said we're working on it.

1387
01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:34.578
<i>You want to cut
the duct tape three feet long.</i>

1388
01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:35.745
Tell him to use his arm.

1389
01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:36.788
Just use your arm.

1390
01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:37.873
<i>It's an arm's length.</i>

1391
01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:39.916
Okay, I see what
you're getting at.

1392
01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:43.086
Jack, tear that piece of tape
down the middle lengthwise.

1393
01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:45.755
<i>- All right?</i>
- Hold on, Houston.

1394
01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.302
<i>While the astronauts appear to have
enough oxygen to keep them alive,</i>

1395
01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:53.597
<i>one thing they have too
much of is carbon dioxide.</i>

1396
01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:55.640
<i>With each breath,
the three men expel</i>

1397
01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:58.935
<i>more of the poisonous gas
into the lunar module cockpit,</i>

1398
01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:01.688
<i>and the scrubbers intended to
keep the atmosphere breathable</i>

1399
01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:03.565
<i>are quickly becoming saturated.</i>

1400
01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.486
Oh, shit, I tore it.

1401
01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:16.119
Houston, what do we do if we
ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1402
01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:17.203
They just tore the bag.

1403
01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:18.496
Oh, no.

1404
01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:20.582
Stand by. What should
I tell them to do?

1405
01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.208
They should have
one more bag left.

1406
01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:25.045
<i>But they've still got
a long way to come,</i>

1407
01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:30.133
<i>and are now working on backup
facilities, their emergency facilities.</i>

1408
01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:32.844
<i>The problem is, if
anything more goes wrong,</i>

1409
01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.054
<i>they're in real trouble.</i>

1410
01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:07.545
<i>As most of you are aware, there is
no rescue possible in space flight.</i>

1411
01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:11.800
<i>Any rescue system the space
agency has long since calculated...</i>

1412
01:31:11.883 --> 01:31:15.345
<i>Any rescue system the
space agency calculated...</i>

1413
01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:21.059
One sock.

1414
01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:24.187
<i>Once you have the
sock in place, we're gonna want you...</i>

1415
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:25.230
Work it in.

1416
01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:28.525
<i>...to bungee the entire filter
assembly to the bulkhead,</i>

1417
01:31:28.566 --> 01:31:29.776
<i>right above the LEM canister.</i>

1418
01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:31.569
We're getting close to 15.

1419
01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:37.575
So how does this flight compare to
other emergency situations you've faced?

1420
01:31:38.618 --> 01:31:41.496
I'll have to say that this is
the most serious situation

1421
01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.040
we've ever encountered
in manned space flight.

1422
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:45.750
Houston, filter's in place.

1423
01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:48.169
Cabin gas return to egress.

1424
01:31:48.586 --> 01:31:50.755
Suit circuit relief to close.

1425
01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:53.675
CO2 canister
select to secondary.

1426
01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:55.343
All right.

1427
01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:57.053
Here goes.

1428
01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:00.640
I can hear air moving.

1429
01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:15.613
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1430
01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:20.827
<i>Aquarius,
please advise on CO2 status.</i>

1431
01:32:21.453 --> 01:32:24.664
Houston, we're taking a look
at those numbers now.

1432
01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:31.296
<i>We're still holding
close to 15, Houston.</i>

1433
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:34.049
<i>Roger that.
Standing by.</i>

1434
01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:47.645
Houston, the CO2 level
has dropped to nine

1435
01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:51.316
and it is still falling.

1436
01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:57.989
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1437
01:32:58.031 --> 01:33:00.867
And you, sir, are a
steely-eyed missile man.

1438
01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:08.500
Okay, spacecraft
control to computer.

1439
01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:10.668
Damn!

1440
01:33:16.382 --> 01:33:17.884
We overloaded.

1441
01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:19.511
<i>We used way too much power.</i>

1442
01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:23.848
<i>There must be a sneak circuit
someplace between step seven and 10.</i>

1443
01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:26.893
All right,
which one has the leak?

1444
01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.229
I don't know that yet, John.

1445
01:33:29.312 --> 01:33:31.152
The sequence was wrong.
We just have to go back

1446
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:33.274
and try them one at a time.

1447
01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.152
You need a break, Ken?

1448
01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:38.404
If they don't get one,
I don't get one.

1449
01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:45.537
Well, if it won't
work, get me another one.

1450
01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:47.455
My son's supposed to be on.

1451
01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:48.873
I know,
Mrs. Lovell.

1452
01:33:48.915 --> 01:33:50.291
Hi, Blanch.

1453
01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:53.837
They can't fix a damn
thing in this place.

1454
01:33:54.212 --> 01:33:56.381
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1455
01:33:57.215 --> 01:33:59.050
Hi, Grandma.

1456
01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:01.553
I was gonna see Jimmy.

1457
01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:03.263
I know.

1458
01:34:05.723 --> 01:34:07.892
We came to tell you something.

1459
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:12.272
There's been an accident.
Jimmy's okay, he's all right.

1460
01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:17.944
But he's not gonna get
to walk on the moon.

1461
01:34:18.736 --> 01:34:20.738
Well, they said he was.

1462
01:34:21.364 --> 01:34:23.074
I know.

1463
01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:27.579
That was before.

1464
01:34:27.829 --> 01:34:31.166
Now there's been an
explosion, and they're all okay,

1465
01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:35.086
they're all right. But
now they're just going to

1466
01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:39.507
try to figure out
a way to get them home.

1467
01:34:45.597 --> 01:34:47.932
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1468
01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:50.852
Oh, sweetie.

1469
01:34:54.898 --> 01:34:56.441
Are you scared?

1470
01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.031
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1471
01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:07.076
If they could get
a washing machine to fly,

1472
01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:10.580
my Jimmy could land it.

1473
01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:53.915
<i>Jack, you'll be happy
to hear we contacted President Nixon,</i>

1474
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:57.627
<i>and he's gonna grant you an
extension on your income taxes</i>

1475
01:35:57.669 --> 01:36:01.631
<i>since you are most
decidedly out of the country.</i>

1476
01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:05.843
Roger that, Houston.

1477
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.804
That's wonderful news.

1478
01:36:08.554 --> 01:36:10.139
Tell them they have to sleep.

1479
01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:12.517
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1480
01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:16.354
<i>13</i>, we've got another
request from the flight surgeon

1481
01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:18.481
that you fellas
get some more sleep.

1482
01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:21.192
<i>He doesn't like
his readings down here.</i>

1483
01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:24.070
Let's see how
he feels about this.

1484
01:36:24.153 --> 01:36:27.532
I am sick and tired of
the entire western world

1485
01:36:27.949 --> 01:36:31.119
knowing how my kidneys
are functioning!

1486
01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.709
Flight, I just lost Lovell.

1487
01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.132
<i>13,</i> this is Houston.

1488
01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:48.219
<i>Jim, we just had a dropout
on your bio-med sensors.</i>

1489
01:36:48.803 --> 01:36:51.723
I'm not wearing my
bio-med sensors, Houston.

1490
01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:03.985
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1491
01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:22.211
Now I'm losing
all three of them!

1492
01:37:23.087 --> 01:37:25.715
It's just a little
medical mutiny, Doc.

1493
01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:28.634
I'm sure the guys
are still with us.

1494
01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:30.970
Let's cut them some slack, okay?

1495
01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:46.527
Gene, it's not the velocity,
it's the angle.

1496
01:37:47.236 --> 01:37:49.113
Maybe they're still
venting something

1497
01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:50.716
and that's throwing
off the trajectory,

1498
01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.700
but we are definitely
shallowing again.

1499
01:37:52.784 --> 01:37:54.577
We are up to a 5.9.

1500
01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:55.620
Damn it.

1501
01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:59.290
At this rate, they nick the
atmosphere and bounce off into space.

1502
01:37:59.374 --> 01:38:01.292
We need another burn
to get them back.

1503
01:38:01.334 --> 01:38:02.543
Another burn.

1504
01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:04.063
Fire the engines,
get them on course.

1505
01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:05.129
Copy that.

1506
01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:28.361
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1507
01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:31.030
Houston, Aquarius.

1508
01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:34.784
<i>Jim, we've got
another course correction for you.</i>

1509
01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:36.160
What's up?

1510
01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:38.996
Something about
another course correction.

1511
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.249
We copy, Houston.

1512
01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:44.669
Be advised, it's gonna
take Freddo and I

1513
01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.087
a while to power up the computer

1514
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:49.841
for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

1515
01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:54.178
<i>Negative on that, Jim.
We can't spare power for the computer.</i>

1516
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.098
We gotta do this blind?

1517
01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:01.227
Houston, without the computer,
what do we use for orientation?

1518
01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:04.188
Come on, we gotta be able
to give these guys something.

1519
01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:06.524
Without the power, we
can't give them a reading.

1520
01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:08.359
Not power. I'm talking
about reference.

1521
01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:11.279
No, there's no references.
We have a bunch of debris up there...

1522
01:39:12.196 --> 01:39:14.907
Houston, what's the story
with this burn?

1523
01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:18.202
<i>We're trying to hash
something out down here, Aquarius.</i>

1524
01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:19.537
<i>Stand by.</i>

1525
01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:24.917
Look, Houston, all we need to hold
attitude is one fixed point in space.

1526
01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:27.128
Is that not correct?

1527
01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:29.338
<i>Yeah.
Roger that, Jim.</i>

1528
01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:35.887
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1529
01:39:36.345 --> 01:39:39.140
If we can keep the Earth in
the window, flying manually,

1530
01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:41.851
<i>the crosshairs
right on its terminator,</i>

1531
01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:45.771
<i>all I have to know is, how long
do we need to burn the engine?</i>

1532
01:39:45.855 --> 01:39:47.607
The shorter, the better.

1533
01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:49.108
Roger that, Jim.

1534
01:39:49.192 --> 01:39:51.736
Can they fly it manually
and still shut it down on time

1535
01:39:51.777 --> 01:39:53.571
without the computer?

1536
01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:58.409
I guess that's
the best we can do.

1537
01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.077
We're out of time.

1538
01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:02.246
<i>In order to enter
the atmosphere safely,</i>

1539
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:03.748
<i>the crew must aim for a corridor</i>

1540
01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:05.917
<i>just two-and-a-half
degrees wide.</i>

1541
01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.752
<i>If they're too steep,
they'll incinerate</i>

1542
01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.378
<i>in the steadily thickening air.</i>

1543
01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.797
<i>If they're too shallow, they'll
ricochet off the atmosphere</i>

1544
01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:13.925
<i>like a rock skipping off a pond.</i>

1545
01:40:13.966 --> 01:40:16.219
<i>The re-entry corridor
is, in fact, so narrow</i>

1546
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:18.471
<i>that if this basketball
were the Earth</i>

1547
01:40:18.554 --> 01:40:20.264
<i>and this softball were the moon,</i>

1548
01:40:20.306 --> 01:40:22.725
<i>and the two were
placed 14 feet apart,</i>

1549
01:40:22.934 --> 01:40:24.936
<i>the crew would
have to hit a target</i>

1550
01:40:24.977 --> 01:40:27.104
<i>no thicker than
this piece of paper.</i>

1551
01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:29.649
On your toes. We're
doing this one blind.

1552
01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:32.360
Gene, understand that
we've never tried this before,

1553
01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:36.447
burn, cold soak, burn, cold
soak, burn, manual control.

1554
01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:38.449
Look, it will ignite,
will it not?

1555
01:40:38.533 --> 01:40:42.119
I just want you to know the
engine's never been tried like this.

1556
01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:44.622
That's all I'm
trying to tell you.

1557
01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.832
I know what you're
trying to do. I guarantee

1558
01:40:46.916 --> 01:40:49.001
I won't hold you
personally responsible.

1559
01:40:49.085 --> 01:40:52.338
If it lights, it lights.
Let Lovell do the rest.

1560
01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.298
Okay.

1561
01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:57.134
<i>They'll burn
the engine and steer manually,</i>

1562
01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:59.637
<i>attempting to keep
the Earth in the window.</i>

1563
01:41:07.019 --> 01:41:09.272
Okay, this is gonna
take all three of us.

1564
01:41:10.022 --> 01:41:13.776
Freddo, you handle the pitch.

1565
01:41:14.277 --> 01:41:16.737
Put on the translation
controllers, all backwards,

1566
01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:19.991
so if the Earth
starts drifting down,

1567
01:41:20.074 --> 01:41:23.286
you need to thrust aft,
not forward.

1568
01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:26.289
I'll do the same on mine
with everything else.

1569
01:41:26.455 --> 01:41:27.790
We're going to
burn at 10% thrust

1570
01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:29.834
for 39 seconds.
Jack, you time us.

1571
01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:31.335
Got it.

1572
01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:33.838
Give us a count of
the last 10 seconds up to 39.

1573
01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.339
Let's not miss this.

1574
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:41.012
You up to this, Freddo?

1575
01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:44.390
I'm with you.

1576
01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:48.185
Standing by for
corridor control burn.

1577
01:41:48.227 --> 01:41:50.855
Okay, Jim,
you can fire when ready.

1578
01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:53.357
<i>You are go for the manual burn.</i>

1579
01:41:53.691 --> 01:41:57.069
Okay, X-plus button
at 10 seconds. Mark.

1580
01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:58.380
Come on, baby.
One more burn.

1581
01:41:58.404 --> 01:42:00.114
Nine, eight,

1582
01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:02.617
seven, six, five,

1583
01:42:02.825 --> 01:42:03.909
four, three...

1584
01:42:03.993 --> 01:42:05.036
Ullage is go.

1585
01:42:05.161 --> 01:42:07.705
<i>...two, one,
ignition!</i>

1586
01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:11.208
She's burning!

1587
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.710
Master arm off.

1588
01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:13.878
Okay, here we go.

1589
01:42:13.919 --> 01:42:15.212
<i>Helium regulator on.</i>

1590
01:42:15.254 --> 01:42:17.214
<i>RCS is go, 10% thrust.</i>

1591
01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:19.717
Bring her around, Freddo.

1592
01:42:19.759 --> 01:42:21.844
I'm trying but it's dragging.

1593
01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:23.512
Ten seconds.

1594
01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:24.930
<i>Drop it down, Freddo.</i>

1595
01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:26.700
<i>- We're drifting!
- No, hold what you got.</i>

1596
01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:27.784
<i>I'll roll it.
Back off.</i>

1597
01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:28.934
<i>Can't get it stable.</i>

1598
01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:31.854
She's dancing
all over the place!

1599
01:42:31.896 --> 01:42:33.136
Come to the right a little bit.

1600
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:34.774
Fifteen seconds.

1601
01:42:34.857 --> 01:42:37.109
<i>She's drifting.
I'm losing attitude.</i>

1602
01:42:37.193 --> 01:42:39.612
<i>Hold it right there.
That's it. No, Freddo, back!</i>

1603
01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:40.780
<i>Shit!
I'm losing it!</i>

1604
01:42:40.863 --> 01:42:41.906
<i>Bring the Earth up.</i>

1605
01:42:42.198 --> 01:42:44.533
Thrust forward, Fred.
Come on.

1606
01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:47.995
Shit, I lost it!
Where is it?

1607
01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:50.081
<i>Helium regulator's closed.</i>

1608
01:42:50.748 --> 01:42:52.917
Bring it down, Freddo.
Just nose it down.

1609
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.752
- Okay, I got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1610
01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:56.879
<i>Little farther.
Ease your touch!</i>

1611
01:42:58.172 --> 01:43:01.050
Damn it, that's mine.
That's me. Around.

1612
01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:04.095
A little more.
Come on, baby.

1613
01:43:04.136 --> 01:43:06.013
That's it. Hold it.

1614
01:43:06.097 --> 01:43:07.598
Back! That's it!
Hold it! Steady.

1615
01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.100
...eight, nine!

1616
01:43:09.225 --> 01:43:10.559
Shutdown!

1617
01:43:21.445 --> 01:43:23.197
Houston, we have shutdown.

1618
01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.908
<i>That's close
enough, Jim. Good work.</i>

1619
01:43:27.076 --> 01:43:30.996
I knew it! How about
that LEM! How about it?

1620
01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:33.934
Guess you can keep your job.

1621
01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:35.126
You betcha.

1622
01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:39.130
<i>CAPCOM 2:13, stand by. We're
evaluating our power usage on that burn.</i>

1623
01:43:41.006 --> 01:43:43.342
Let's hope we don't
have to do that again.

1624
01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:01.402
Gentlemen, you've given our
guys enough to survive till re-entry.

1625
01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.196
Well done.

1626
01:44:07.867 --> 01:44:10.995
Now we gotta get them in, so tell
me about the power-up procedures.

1627
01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:13.497
Here's the order
of what I want to do.

1628
01:44:13.664 --> 01:44:17.501
I want to power up guidance,
ECS, communications,

1629
01:44:18.377 --> 01:44:20.546
warm up the pyros
for the parachutes

1630
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:22.506
and the command
module thrusters.

1631
01:44:22.715 --> 01:44:25.468
The thrusters will put
you over budget on amps.

1632
01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:28.429
They've been sitting at
200 below for four days.

1633
01:44:28.512 --> 01:44:29.638
They gotta be heated.

1634
01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.682
Fine. Then trade off
the parachutes.

1635
01:44:32.141 --> 01:44:34.393
If the chutes don't open,
what's the point?

1636
01:44:34.477 --> 01:44:36.020
You're telling me what you need.

1637
01:44:36.145 --> 01:44:39.899
I'm telling you what we have to
work with. I'm not making this stuff up.

1638
01:44:40.024 --> 01:44:41.984
They're going to need
all these systems.

1639
01:44:42.026 --> 01:44:45.529
We do not have the power,
Ken. We just don't have it.

1640
01:44:49.366 --> 01:44:53.078
I'll reorganize the sequencing
again and find more power.

1641
01:44:53.579 --> 01:44:56.540
Let's start from scratch.
Clear the board.

1642
01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:02.171
I don't know where
the hell we'll find it.

1643
01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:06.550
Apollo 13 <i>commander Jim
Lovell has more time in space,</i>

1644
01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:09.553
<i>almost 24 days already,
than any other man,</i>

1645
01:45:09.595 --> 01:45:12.139
<i>and I asked him recently
if he ever was scared.</i>

1646
01:45:12.223 --> 01:45:15.518
<i>I've had an engine flame
out a few times in an aircraft,</i>

1647
01:45:15.559 --> 01:45:18.229
<i>and was curious as to whether
it was going to light up again,</i>

1648
01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:20.481
<i>things of that nature,</i>

1649
01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:22.650
<i>but they seem to work out.</i>

1650
01:45:23.359 --> 01:45:25.736
<i>Ls there an
instance in an airplane emergency</i>

1651
01:45:25.778 --> 01:45:27.863
<i>when you can recall fear?</i>

1652
01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.992
<i>Well, I remember this one time</i>

1653
01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:35.871
<i>in a Banshee at night in combat
conditions, so the carrier has no lights.</i>

1654
01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.707
<i>It was the</i> Shangri-la.
<i>We were in the Sea of Japan.</i>

1655
01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:42.419
<i>My radar had jammed, and
my homing signal was gone</i>

1656
01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:45.881
<i>because somebody in Japan
was using the same frequency,</i>

1657
01:45:46.257 --> 01:45:49.510
<i>and so it was leading me away
from where I was supposed to be.</i>

1658
01:45:49.927 --> 01:45:54.849
<i>I'm looking down at a big, black
ocean, so I flip on my map light.</i>

1659
01:45:55.266 --> 01:45:58.769
<i>Then, suddenly, zap! Everything
shorts out right there in my cockpit.</i>

1660
01:45:58.853 --> 01:46:00.729
<i>All my instruments
and lights are gone,</i>

1661
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:03.065
<i>I can't even tell
what my altitude is.</i>

1662
01:46:04.066 --> 01:46:05.484
<i>I know I'm running out of fuel,</i>

1663
01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:08.612
<i>so I'm thinking about
ditching in the ocean.</i>

1664
01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:12.199
<i>I look down there,
and then in the darkness</i>

1665
01:46:12.283 --> 01:46:14.910
<i>there's this green trail.</i>

1666
01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:18.289
<i>It's like a long carpet that's
just laid out beneath me.</i>

1667
01:46:18.372 --> 01:46:19.415
<i>It was the algae!</i>

1668
01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:21.935
<i>It was that phosphorescent stuff</i>

1669
01:46:21.959 --> 01:46:24.795
<i>that gets churned up
in the wake of a big ship.</i>

1670
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.131
<i>It was just leading me home.</i>

1671
01:46:27.464 --> 01:46:30.551
<i>And if my cockpit lights
hadn't shorted out,</i>

1672
01:46:30.634 --> 01:46:32.928
<i>there's no way I'd have
ever been able to see that.</i>

1673
01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.472
<i>So, you never know</i>

1674
01:46:35.556 --> 01:46:38.976
<i>what events are going to
transpire to get you home.</i>

1675
01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:45.498
<i>Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell,</i>

1676
01:46:45.524 --> 01:46:47.818
<i>no stranger to emergency is he.</i>

1677
01:46:58.996 --> 01:47:00.414
How's it going, Fred?

1678
01:47:00.497 --> 01:47:01.624
I'm okay.

1679
01:47:04.001 --> 01:47:05.753
What the hell was that?

1680
01:47:06.670 --> 01:47:08.964
Let's hope it was
just the burst disk.

1681
01:47:09.006 --> 01:47:11.675
Can you confirm
a burst helium disk?

1682
01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:13.093
<i>We confirm that.</i>

1683
01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:16.931
Houston, is that going to
affect our entry angle at all?

1684
01:47:17.514 --> 01:47:20.768
<i>Negative. Your entry
angle is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.</i>

1685
01:47:21.518 --> 01:47:22.978
Houston,

1686
01:47:24.855 --> 01:47:28.943
we sure could use the
re-entry procedure up here.

1687
01:47:29.735 --> 01:47:31.820
<i>When can we expect that?</i>

1688
01:47:34.323 --> 01:47:36.659
That's coming
real soon, Aquarius.

1689
01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:38.327
Houston, we...

1690
01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:42.373
We just can't throw this
together at the last minute.

1691
01:47:42.414 --> 01:47:44.792
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1692
01:47:45.209 --> 01:47:48.879
You're gonna get the
procedure up to us, whatever it is,

1693
01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:53.217
and we're gonna go over it step
by step, so there's no foul-ups.

1694
01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:57.137
I don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1695
01:47:57.221 --> 01:48:00.015
The world's getting
awfully big in the window.

1696
01:48:00.182 --> 01:48:01.392
Jim, this is Deke.

1697
01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:02.518
It's Deke.

1698
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:05.354
They don't know how to do it.

1699
01:48:05.896 --> 01:48:07.481
Maybe Jack's right.

1700
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:10.943
Hello, Deke.
What's the story?

1701
01:48:11.026 --> 01:48:14.989
We're gonna get that procedure
to you as soon as we possibly can.

1702
01:48:15.072 --> 01:48:18.075
<i>Ken Mattingly's in
the simulator right now.</i>

1703
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:21.245
Ken's working on it?

1704
01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:28.252
Look, I know this
sequence works, John.

1705
01:48:28.377 --> 01:48:31.005
It looks good. We're just
over budget on the amperage.

1706
01:48:31.088 --> 01:48:32.172
<i>By how much?</i>

1707
01:48:32.297 --> 01:48:33.424
Three or four amps.

1708
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:35.759
God damn it, John!
Is it three or four?

1709
01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:37.261
- Four.
- Four!

1710
01:48:39.054 --> 01:48:40.597
Four more amps.

1711
01:48:51.275 --> 01:48:54.069
They have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1712
01:48:54.111 --> 01:48:55.279
<i>Yeah.</i>

1713
01:48:56.697 --> 01:48:58.615
We have an umbilical
that provides power

1714
01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:00.743
from the command module
to the LEM.

1715
01:49:00.784 --> 01:49:03.120
It's backup for the
LEM power supply.

1716
01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:04.496
I'm listening.

1717
01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:07.791
So reverse it.
Reverse the flow

1718
01:49:07.875 --> 01:49:09.376
and see if we can
draw these four amps

1719
01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:12.296
from the LEM before we cut
it loose. Why can't we do that?

1720
01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:15.507
We don't have
a procedure for that?

1721
01:49:15.591 --> 01:49:17.509
You'll lose a lot
in the transfer.

1722
01:49:17.593 --> 01:49:21.055
Yeah. But all we're talking
about here is four amps.

1723
01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:24.933
I want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1724
01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:26.226
Gene, they're already...

1725
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:27.936
Not all, just part.

1726
01:49:27.978 --> 01:49:29.396
We've got to
give them something.

1727
01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:30.939
They're working on it.

1728
01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:32.024
I'll get an estimate.

1729
01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:33.108
God damn it!

1730
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:37.404
I don't want another estimate!
I want the procedures now!

1731
01:49:49.833 --> 01:49:51.251
IMU is up.

1732
01:49:52.503 --> 01:49:54.004
<i>How am I reading?</i>

1733
01:49:54.046 --> 01:49:55.172
Fine, so far.

1734
01:49:55.339 --> 01:49:56.381
<i>Say again.</i>

1735
01:49:56.465 --> 01:49:57.966
You're under the limit.
Keep going.

1736
01:49:58.967 --> 01:50:01.095
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1737
01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:05.516
<i>Okay, I'm
bringing up the guidance.</i>

1738
01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:09.645
Here we go.

1739
01:50:11.188 --> 01:50:12.856
CMC Attitude IMU.

1740
01:50:13.565 --> 01:50:15.025
<i>CMC source.</i>

1741
01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:19.488
CMC mode, auto,
and we're on the computer.

1742
01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:31.875
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1743
01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:33.168
Is your computer on now?

1744
01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:35.879
Up and running.

1745
01:50:36.547 --> 01:50:38.006
How do we look?

1746
01:50:47.516 --> 01:50:49.560
I think we got it, buddy.

1747
01:50:59.528 --> 01:51:03.073
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1748
01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:04.592
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1749
01:51:04.616 --> 01:51:06.577
I was getting
a little blurry there.

1750
01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:11.915
Here's Ken.
Here's John.

1751
01:51:12.749 --> 01:51:14.877
It's good to see you, Ken.

1752
01:51:15.252 --> 01:51:16.545
This is the sequence.

1753
01:51:16.587 --> 01:51:17.647
Was it tried
on the hardware yet?

1754
01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:19.840
We didn't have time.

1755
01:51:20.883 --> 01:51:23.218
Aquarius, Houston.
Do you read?

1756
01:51:24.219 --> 01:51:26.221
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1757
01:51:28.432 --> 01:51:30.893
Are the flowers
blooming in Houston?

1758
01:51:30.934 --> 01:51:34.771
That's a negative, Jim.
I don't have the measles.

1759
01:51:39.443 --> 01:51:41.528
<i>Jim, is Jack in there with you?</i>

1760
01:51:41.945 --> 01:51:44.781
Yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.

1761
01:51:44.907 --> 01:51:46.074
Put those on the table.

1762
01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:47.784
Damn it.
Thanks, Jackie.

1763
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:50.245
I think it would really
help if you could

1764
01:51:50.287 --> 01:51:54.708
just distract her when the
heavy predictions come in.

1765
01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:56.752
We'll give it a shot.

1766
01:51:56.793 --> 01:51:57.878
Thanks.

1767
01:52:00.047 --> 01:52:03.592
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch television with you.

1768
01:52:03.634 --> 01:52:06.011
This is Neil Armstrong,
and this is Buzz.

1769
01:52:06.094 --> 01:52:07.221
Nice to meet you.

1770
01:52:07.304 --> 01:52:08.597
Hi.

1771
01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:11.350
Are you boys in
the space program, too?

1772
01:52:13.227 --> 01:52:16.813
Okay, Jack, give me a
read-back on that last procedure.

1773
01:52:17.147 --> 01:52:18.649
Stand by, Ken.

1774
01:52:22.444 --> 01:52:26.657
Ken, I'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

1775
01:52:26.782 --> 01:52:30.077
I guess I was a little
more tired than I thought.

1776
01:52:35.123 --> 01:52:37.751
Don't worry, Jack.
I'll talk you through it.

1777
01:52:40.504 --> 01:52:43.340
Find the main bus
breakers on panel 11.

1778
01:52:45.842 --> 01:52:47.761
Yeah, main bus breakers.
Got it.

1779
01:52:47.844 --> 01:52:49.304
<i>Close main bus B.</i>

1780
01:52:57.604 --> 01:53:01.358
Ken, there's an awful lot of
condensation on these panels.

1781
01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:04.361
What's the word on
these things shorting out?

1782
01:53:08.699 --> 01:53:11.535
We'll just take that
one at a time, Jack.

1783
01:53:14.037 --> 01:53:17.666
It's like trying to drive a
toaster through a car wash.

1784
01:53:25.215 --> 01:53:27.134
<i>Main bus B is closed.</i>

1785
01:53:27.217 --> 01:53:29.803
<i>13, we're coming up
on entry interface.</i>

1786
01:53:29.886 --> 01:53:33.515
Flight, we're still shallowing
up a bit in the re-entry corridor.

1787
01:53:33.557 --> 01:53:35.726
It's almost like
they're underweight.

1788
01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:37.311
Now how could
they be underweight?

1789
01:53:37.394 --> 01:53:39.187
We didn't land on the moon.

1790
01:53:40.897 --> 01:53:42.858
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1791
01:53:43.859 --> 01:53:47.070
<i>One more thing, Jim. While
Jack's working on the power-up,</i>

1792
01:53:47.112 --> 01:53:48.322
<i>we want you and Freddo</i>

1793
01:53:48.405 --> 01:53:50.907
<i>to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.</i>

1794
01:53:50.991 --> 01:53:52.868
Say again, Houston.
Ballast?

1795
01:53:53.493 --> 01:53:56.371
That's affirm. We got
to get the weight right.

1796
01:53:56.413 --> 01:53:57.956
We were expecting
you to be toting

1797
01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.083
a couple hundred
pounds of moon rocks.

1798
01:54:00.167 --> 01:54:01.418
Right, Houston.

1799
01:54:02.169 --> 01:54:03.170
<i>Now, Jack.</i>

1800
01:54:03.253 --> 01:54:04.338
Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1801
01:54:04.421 --> 01:54:06.715
<i>Okay, now, panel five.</i>

1802
01:54:07.382 --> 01:54:12.179
<i>Circuit breaker caution
and warning main B closed.</i>

1803
01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:13.513
Main B closed.

1804
01:54:15.724 --> 01:54:17.434
Master alarm off.

1805
01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:21.730
Okay, Jack, on panel seven,
b-mag number two, power to warm-up.

1806
01:54:21.938 --> 01:54:24.566
B-mag number two,
power to warm-up. Done.

1807
01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:27.277
<i>Sequential logic one and two on.</i>

1808
01:54:27.611 --> 01:54:30.447
Sequential logic, two on.

1809
01:54:30.781 --> 01:54:33.450
<i>CMRCS pressure, on.</i>

1810
01:54:33.492 --> 01:54:35.285
CMRCS pressurization.

1811
01:54:35.577 --> 01:54:39.081
{\an8}As her husband prepares
to jettison his lunar module lifeboat,

1812
01:54:39.122 --> 01:54:41.875
{\an8}Marilyn Lovell waits with
her children, her neighbors,

1813
01:54:41.958 --> 01:54:44.169
and, we are told,
<i>Apollo 11</i> astronauts

1814
01:54:44.252 --> 01:54:46.421
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1815
01:54:46.922 --> 01:54:49.633
Only the Lovells' eldest
son, Jay, is absent

1816
01:54:49.674 --> 01:54:52.010
as he holds vigil
with his classmates

1817
01:54:52.094 --> 01:54:55.263
at the St. John's Military
Academy in Wisconsin.

1818
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:58.141
<i>ABC News science
editor Jules Bergman.</i>

1819
01:54:58.183 --> 01:54:59.768
<i>With a crippled command module,</i>

1820
01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:02.104
<i>and surviving by using
the LEM's systems,</i>

1821
01:55:02.145 --> 01:55:04.106
<i>there can be no easy maneuver.</i>

1822
01:55:04.147 --> 01:55:07.150
<i>Their LEM lifeboat is doing
things and working longer</i>

1823
01:55:07.234 --> 01:55:09.069
<i>than it was ever intended to.</i>

1824
01:55:09.152 --> 01:55:11.571
<i>It's a race against time
until splashdown...</i>

1825
01:55:11.822 --> 01:55:14.616
<i>We're ready to see
if the computer will accept</i>

1826
01:55:14.658 --> 01:55:16.993
<i>uplink of the re-entry data now.</i>

1827
01:55:18.328 --> 01:55:19.621
Okay, the IMU is up.

1828
01:55:19.663 --> 01:55:20.956
We got our eight-balls back.

1829
01:55:20.997 --> 01:55:22.207
<i>Copy that.</i>

1830
01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:27.003
Okay, Ken, uplink telemetry,
command module to accept, right?

1831
01:55:27.796 --> 01:55:30.340
That's affirm.
Go ahead and try it.

1832
01:55:51.027 --> 01:55:52.779
Uplink completed.

1833
01:55:58.368 --> 01:55:59.661
That's more like it.

1834
01:55:59.703 --> 01:56:01.037
Okay, let's go.

1835
01:56:01.163 --> 01:56:03.331
Take a look at your
amps. How we doing?

1836
01:56:06.293 --> 01:56:08.211
We got her back up, Ken.

1837
01:56:08.962 --> 01:56:10.672
Boy, I wish you
were here to see it.

1838
01:56:10.714 --> 01:56:12.382
I'll bet you do.

1839
01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:17.304
Way to go, Jack.

1840
01:56:22.392 --> 01:56:23.393
Flight, this is RETRO.

1841
01:56:23.477 --> 01:56:24.478
<i>Go, RETRO.</i>

1842
01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:27.355
Flight, we have
a typhoon warning

1843
01:56:27.397 --> 01:56:29.065
<i>on the edge of
the prime recovery zone.</i>

1844
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:30.442
Say again, RETRO.

1845
01:56:30.525 --> 01:56:32.819
<i>We're looking at
a typhoon warning</i>

1846
01:56:32.903 --> 01:56:34.738
on the edge of
the prime recovery area.

1847
01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:37.491
This is just a warning.
It could miss them.

1848
01:56:37.574 --> 01:56:39.743
Only if their luck changes.

1849
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:42.412
Jim, we're ready
for SM jettison!

1850
01:56:43.246 --> 01:56:45.373
All right, Jack, on three!

1851
01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.585
One, two...

1852
01:56:49.252 --> 01:56:50.837
Upward thrust.

1853
01:56:50.921 --> 01:56:51.922
We're loose!

1854
01:56:52.881 --> 01:56:54.549
Reverse thrust!

1855
01:56:54.758 --> 01:56:57.093
<i>We have service module jettison.</i>

1856
01:56:57.177 --> 01:56:59.888
<i>Okay, Houston,
service module is free.</i>

1857
01:57:00.263 --> 01:57:02.349
<i>We'll take a look
at what we have here.</i>

1858
01:57:02.557 --> 01:57:03.934
<i>Copy that.</i>

1859
01:57:08.104 --> 01:57:10.023
There it is.
I see it!

1860
01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:16.947
Houston, we're getting our
first look at the service module now.

1861
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:19.783
One whole side of
the spacecraft is missing.

1862
01:57:21.201 --> 01:57:25.038
<i>Right by the high gain antenna
a whole panel is blown out,</i>

1863
01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:28.291
<i>right up to our heat shield.</i>

1864
01:57:29.751 --> 01:57:31.586
Copy that, Aquarius.

1865
01:57:31.628 --> 01:57:35.131
It looked like it got the engine
bell, too. Can you see that?

1866
01:57:39.052 --> 01:57:41.221
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1867
01:57:44.599 --> 01:57:45.809
The heat shield.

1868
01:57:45.934 --> 01:57:48.144
<i>The heat
will build up to as much</i>

1869
01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:50.564
<i>as 3, 000 or 4, 000
degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

1870
01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:53.900
<i>On a lunar re-entry flight,
the heat...</i>

1871
01:57:53.984 --> 01:57:55.443
So, Blanch?

1872
01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:00.115
Did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?

1873
01:58:00.282 --> 01:58:01.950
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

1874
01:58:01.992 --> 01:58:04.411
<i>If the heat
shield is even slightly cracked</i>

1875
01:58:04.494 --> 01:58:06.955
<i>the extreme cold
could've split it wide open.</i>

1876
01:58:07.247 --> 01:58:10.417
<i>Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics
that control the parachutes</i>

1877
01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.253
<i>have been damaged, the
chutes may not open at all,</i>

1878
01:58:13.336 --> 01:58:15.005
<i>causing the spacecraft
to hit the water</i>

1879
01:58:15.088 --> 01:58:17.173
<i>not at a gentle
20 miles per hour,</i>

1880
01:58:17.465 --> 01:58:19.342
<i>but at a suicidal 300.</i>

1881
01:58:19.801 --> 01:58:21.469
<i>Perhaps never in human history</i>

1882
01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:25.348
<i>has the entire world been
united by such a global drama.</i>

1883
01:58:25.432 --> 01:58:28.059
<i>In New York City, thousands
of people have gathered</i>

1884
01:58:28.143 --> 01:58:30.812
<i>to watch updates of the
mission in Times Square.</i>

1885
01:58:30.854 --> 01:58:33.732
<i>Many countries offered help
and the State Department said</i>

1886
01:58:33.815 --> 01:58:35.900
<i>it would ask for it
if it were needed.</i>

1887
01:58:35.984 --> 01:58:39.279
<i>The House and Senate passed
resolutions calling on the people</i>

1888
01:58:39.362 --> 01:58:41.364
<i>to pray tonight
for the astronauts.</i>

1889
01:58:41.406 --> 01:58:42.866
<i>In Rome, Pope Paul led</i>

1890
01:58:42.907 --> 01:58:47.203
<i>50, 000 people in prayers for
the safe return of the astronauts.</i>

1891
01:58:47.537 --> 01:58:49.956
<i>In Jerusalem, prayers
at the Wailing Wall...</i>

1892
01:58:56.129 --> 01:58:59.049
It's about time to
bail out of this ship.

1893
01:59:06.514 --> 01:59:07.849
You okay?

1894
01:59:09.559 --> 01:59:11.061
I'm freezing.

1895
01:59:13.563 --> 01:59:16.232
Can you hold out
just a little longer?

1896
01:59:16.650 --> 01:59:17.734
Long as I have to.

1897
01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:18.902
Come on.

1898
01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:23.239
It won't be long.
Just a little while longer.

1899
01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:30.580
Just a little while longer. We're
gonna hit that water in the South Pacific.

1900
01:59:31.414 --> 01:59:33.249
Open up that hatch.

1901
01:59:34.501 --> 01:59:36.086
It's 80 degrees out there.

1902
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:37.379
80 degrees.

1903
01:59:40.256 --> 01:59:42.467
You are a mess.

1904
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:43.635
Yeah.

1905
01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:48.431
<i>Odyssey, Houston.
How we doing, guys?</i>

1906
01:59:48.515 --> 01:59:50.767
<i>We're closing in on
lunar module jettison.</i>

1907
01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:53.061
<i>As you know,
that is time critical.</i>

1908
01:59:53.103 --> 01:59:55.730
<i>You should be moving
into the command module.</i>

1909
01:59:55.772 --> 01:59:57.440
<i>Let's get that
hatch buttoned up,</i>

1910
01:59:57.524 --> 02:00:00.276
<i>and when you get a chance,
let us know how you're doing.</i>

1911
02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:01.945
Roger that.

1912
02:00:05.073 --> 02:00:07.409
Let me give you
a hand there, Freddo.

1913
02:00:42.569 --> 02:00:44.988
<i>We're coming up on LEM jettison.</i>

1914
02:00:45.321 --> 02:00:48.074
Ls everyone strapped
in, Ken? We're getting real close.

1915
02:00:48.158 --> 02:00:50.827
Copy that, Flight.
<i>13,</i> Houston.

1916
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.454
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1917
02:00:52.954 --> 02:00:54.289
Stand by.

1918
02:00:55.665 --> 02:00:57.625
<i>Have you got
everybody in the Odyssey?</i>

1919
02:00:57.667 --> 02:01:01.004
Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check those
pyro batteries one more time here.

1920
02:01:02.505 --> 02:01:06.843
The pyro batts look good. I don't
think we have to tie the other batteries.

1921
02:01:19.355 --> 02:01:21.775
Sorry, Jack,
this is an old habit.

1922
02:01:21.858 --> 02:01:25.153
I'm kind of used to the
pilot's seat. She's yours to fly.

1923
02:01:30.533 --> 02:01:33.995
<i>Odyssey, I want to double
check some re-entry procedures</i>

1924
02:01:34.037 --> 02:01:35.997
<i>right after we jettison the LEM,</i>

1925
02:01:36.039 --> 02:01:37.957
<i>which is coming up
in 30 seconds.</i>

1926
02:01:38.875 --> 02:01:40.376
What is that?

1927
02:01:41.878 --> 02:01:43.505
I was getting a little punchy

1928
02:01:43.546 --> 02:01:47.300
and I didn't want to cut the
LEM loose with you guys still in it.

1929
02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.261
That's good thinking.

1930
02:01:52.472 --> 02:01:54.224
Stand by, Houston.

1931
02:01:56.893 --> 02:01:59.229
<i>We have lunar module jettison.</i>

1932
02:02:07.028 --> 02:02:09.072
She sure was a good ship.

1933
02:02:10.532 --> 02:02:13.743
<i>Farewell, Aquarius,
and we thank you.</i>

1934
02:02:24.087 --> 02:02:26.089
It's almost time, honey.

1935
02:02:29.843 --> 02:02:31.928
Flight 966406.

1936
02:02:52.949 --> 02:02:54.117
Let me put it this way.

1937
02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.036
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1938
02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.289
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

1939
02:02:59.372 --> 02:03:01.124
Their heat shield
could be cracked.

1940
02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:04.127
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1941
02:03:04.252 --> 02:03:06.296
Clearly, we have some
obstacles to overcome.

1942
02:03:06.379 --> 02:03:09.465
But now I'm asking you,
when will we know?

1943
02:03:10.508 --> 02:03:11.968
Blackout lasts
for three minutes.

1944
02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:15.179
If they're not back
in four, we'll know.

1945
02:03:16.764 --> 02:03:20.602
Velocity now reading
34,802 feet per second.

1946
02:03:20.727 --> 02:03:22.645
Range to go
2,625 nautical miles.

1947
02:03:22.687 --> 02:03:23.688
Copy that.

1948
02:03:24.647 --> 02:03:27.150
Okay, Ken, we are
aligned for re-entry.

1949
02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:29.360
Jim, we need that
computer re-entry program.

1950
02:03:29.444 --> 02:03:31.112
Fred, how are
the batteries looking?

1951
02:03:31.154 --> 02:03:32.280
Okay.

1952
02:03:33.323 --> 02:03:34.407
Batt A looks good.

1953
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:36.451
<i>Re-entry interface in one minute</i>

1954
02:03:36.492 --> 02:03:37.577
<i>and 30 seconds.</i>

1955
02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:40.163
Batt B, no volts,
the amps are okay.

1956
02:03:41.289 --> 02:03:42.624
Batt C...

1957
02:03:43.666 --> 02:03:45.668
No volts, only two amps.

1958
02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:49.505
It may die before
the main chutes open.

1959
02:03:49.797 --> 02:03:52.634
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1960
02:03:52.675 --> 02:03:56.220
They're still shallowing a bit up
there. Do you want to tell them?

1961
02:03:57.096 --> 02:03:58.490
Is there anything
we can do about it?

1962
02:03:58.514 --> 02:03:59.849
<i>Not now, Flight.</i>

1963
02:03:59.974 --> 02:04:01.201
Then they don't
need to know, do they?

1964
02:04:01.225 --> 02:04:02.393
<i>Copy that.</i>

1965
02:04:02.477 --> 02:04:06.230
RETRO says the typhoon is
still a presence in the splashdown area?

1966
02:04:06.314 --> 02:04:09.192
We got the parachute situation,

1967
02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:11.778
heat shield, angle of
trajectory, and a typhoon.

1968
02:04:11.861 --> 02:04:13.339
There are so many
variables, I'm at a loss...

1969
02:04:13.363 --> 02:04:15.782
I know what the problems are.

1970
02:04:15.865 --> 02:04:18.868
This could be the worst
disaster NASA has experienced.

1971
02:04:18.952 --> 02:04:23.539
With all due respect, sir, I believe
this is going to be our finest hour.

1972
02:04:36.511 --> 02:04:39.138
Expect entry
interface in 45 seconds.

1973
02:04:40.056 --> 02:04:42.183
And on my mark, your velocity

1974
02:04:42.225 --> 02:04:45.478
<i>will be 35,245 feet per second.</i>

1975
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.899
<i>Mark 35 seconds
to entry interface.</i>

1976
02:04:52.694 --> 02:04:54.153
Gentlemen,

1977
02:04:56.739 --> 02:04:59.492
it's been a privilege
flying with you.

1978
02:05:41.451 --> 02:05:43.453
Flight, we have
loss of radio contact.

1979
02:05:43.536 --> 02:05:44.912
Roger that.

1980
02:05:44.954 --> 02:05:47.540
Expect to regain signal
in three minutes.

1981
02:05:51.127 --> 02:05:52.962
It all depends
on the heat shield.

1982
02:06:26.162 --> 02:06:28.831
<i>Back to the Iwo Jima
and our live cameras there.</i>

1983
02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:32.627
<i>The Navy recovery and rescue
helicopters already airborne,</i>

1984
02:06:32.668 --> 02:06:35.505
<i>circling, waiting for
first radar contact.</i>

1985
02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:38.341
<i>Three minutes
until time of drogue deployment.</i>

1986
02:06:39.509 --> 02:06:42.845
<i>Standing by for any
reports of acquisition.</i>

1987
02:06:47.850 --> 02:06:50.978
One minute and 30 seconds
to end of blackout.

1988
02:06:56.275 --> 02:06:58.861
<i>No re-entering
ship has ever taken longer</i>

1989
02:06:58.986 --> 02:07:01.823
<i>than three minutes to
emerge from blackout.</i>

1990
02:07:01.864 --> 02:07:05.284
<i>This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?</i>

1991
02:07:05.701 --> 02:07:09.664
<i>Will the command module
survive the intense heat of re-entry?</i>

1992
02:07:09.997 --> 02:07:12.667
<i>If it doesn't,
there'll only be silence.</i>

1993
02:07:12.792 --> 02:07:14.335
Mommy, you're squishing me.

1994
02:07:14.377 --> 02:07:15.878
Sorry, sweetie.

1995
02:07:16.379 --> 02:07:17.505
It's okay.

1996
02:07:33.855 --> 02:07:35.857
Okay, Flight,
that's three minutes.

1997
02:07:35.898 --> 02:07:37.608
We are standing by
for acquisition.

1998
02:07:37.692 --> 02:07:39.193
Copy that.

1999
02:07:41.028 --> 02:07:43.531

Do you read me?

2000
02:07:46.325 --> 02:07:48.828
<i>Expected time of reacquisition,</i>

<i>the time when the astronauts were

02:07:52.874 --> 02:07:55.543
<i>has come and gone.</i>

2003
02:07:56.586 --> 02:08:00.173
<i>About all any of us can do
now is just listen and hope.</i>

2004

02:09:49.532 --> 02:09:51.492
We're glad to see you.

2017
02:09:52.118 --> 02:09:53.160
Good job, Ken.

2018
02:09:53.202 --> 02:09:54.203
Thank you.

2019
02:10:38.873 --> 02:10:40.374
They made it!

2020
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:26.420
Houston, we're at stable
one. The ship is secure.

2021
02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:29.548
This is <i>Apollo 13</i> signing off.

2022
02:11:29.673 --> 02:11:31.008
Good job.

2023
02:12:23.185 --> 02:12:25.563
<i>Our mission was called
a successful failure</i>

2024
02:12:25.646 --> 02:12:29.400
<i>in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.</i>

2025
02:12:29.608 --> 02:12:31.694
<i>In the following months
it was determined</i>

2026
02:12:31.735 --> 02:12:34.822
<i>that a damaged coil
built inside the oxygen tank</i>

2027
02:12:35.322 --> 02:12:37.533
<i>sparked during
our cryo stir and caused</i>

2028
02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:39.910
<i>the explosion that
crippled the Odyssey.</i>

2029
02:12:40.202 --> 02:12:42.455
<i>It was a minor defect
that occurred two years</i>

2030
02:12:42.538 --> 02:12:44.915
<i>before I was even named
the flight's commander.</i>

2031
02:12:45.708 --> 02:12:49.086
<i>Fred Haise was going back
to the moon on</i> Apollo 18,

2032
02:12:49.170 --> 02:12:51.297
<i>but his mission was
cancelled due to budget cuts.</i>

2033
02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:53.382
<i>He never flew in space again.</i>

2034
02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:56.719
<i>Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the Astronaut Corps</i>

2035
02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:59.889
<i>and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.</i>

2036
02:13:00.055 --> 02:13:02.892
<i>But he died of cancer before
he was able to take office.</i>

2037
02:13:04.351 --> 02:13:05.728
<i>Ken Mattingly orbited the moon</i>

2038
02:13:05.769 --> 02:13:08.230
<i>as command module pilot
of</i> Apollo 16,

2039
02:13:08.314 --> 02:13:12.109
<i>and flew the Space Shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.</i>

2040
02:13:12.776 --> 02:13:15.821
<i>Gene Kranz retired as
Director of Flight Operations</i>

2041
02:13:15.905 --> 02:13:17.239
<i>just not long ago.</i>

2042
02:13:17.531 --> 02:13:20.576
<i>Many members of Mission
Control have gone on to other things,</i>

2043
02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:22.745
<i>but some are still there.</i>

2044
02:13:23.704 --> 02:13:25.164
<i>And as for me,</i>

2045
02:13:25.539 --> 02:13:29.668
<i>the seven extraordinary days of</i>
Apollo 13 <i>were my last in space.</i>

2046
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:34.673
<i>I watched other men walk
on the moon and return safely,</i>

2047
02:13:35.132 --> 02:13:39.386
<i>all from the confines of Mission
Control and our house in Houston.</i>

2048
02:13:40.513 --> 02:13:43.224
<i>I sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon,</i>

2049
02:13:43.307 --> 02:13:46.769
<i>remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage,</i>

2050
02:13:47.019 --> 02:13:48.729
<i>thinking of
the thousands of people</i>

2051
02:13:48.771 --> 02:13:51.106
<i>who worked to bring
the three of us home.</i>

2052
02:13:52.441 --> 02:13:55.027
<i>I look up at the moon and wonder</i>

2053
02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:57.404
<i>when will we be going back</i>

2054
02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.074
<i>and who will that be?</i>
