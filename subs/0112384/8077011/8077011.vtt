actually grabs us and pulls us

the last time he was in a simulator?

and go with Swigert,

358

Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

851
00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:26.406
What have we got on
the spacecraft that's good?

852
00:55:28.242 --> 00:55:30.244
(EXHALES) I'll get
back to you, Gene.

853
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.249
We're not gonna have
power much longer.

854
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:37.543
The ship's bleeding to death.

855
00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:42.339
(SIGHING)

856
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.301
Flight?

857
00:55:46.385 --> 00:55:48.262
GENE:
<i>Yeah. Go, EECOM.</i>

858
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:52.808
Um, Flight, I recommend we shut
down the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

859
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:56.311
What the hell good
is that gonna do?

860
00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:59.147
If the leak's there,
we can isolate it.

861
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:02.609
We can save what's left in the
tanks, and run on the good cell.

862
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.128
You close them, you
can't open them again.

863
00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:06.905
You can't land on
the moon with one cell.

864
00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:10.450
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

865
00:56:11.285 --> 00:56:14.204
From my chair here,
this is the last option.

866
00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:24.006
Yeah. Okay, Sy.

867
00:56:39.688 --> 00:56:42.900
Capcom, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

868
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:44.735
<i>13,</i> this is Houston.

869
00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:48.614
We want you to close react
valves on cells one and three.

870
00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:50.782
Do you copy?

871
00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.745
Are you saying you
want the whole smash?

872
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:58.248
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shutdown?

873
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:02.461
Shutting down the fuel
cells? Did I hear you right?

874
00:57:03.128 --> 00:57:05.172
Yeah, they heard me right.

875
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.551
Tell them we think that's the
only way they can stop the leak.

876
00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:10.844
Yeah, Jim,

877
00:57:10.928 --> 00:57:14.473
<i>we think that closing the
react valves may stop the leak.</i>

878
00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:25.609

880
00:57:29.529 --> 00:57:31.365
Yes, Houston, we copy.

881
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.997
We just lost the moon.

882
00:57:48.757 --> 00:57:50.968
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

883
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.972
Let's see what this does.

884
00:58:03.397 --> 00:58:05.190
If this doesn't work,

885
00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:08.735
we're not gonna have
enough power left to get home.

886
00:58:26.086 --> 00:58:27.379

887
00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:28.755

FRED: Houston, 02 on one
is still falling.

889
00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:37.597
How long does it take
to power up the LEM?

890
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:39.891
Three hours by the checklist.

891
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.561
We don't have that much time.

892
00:58:42.602 --> 00:58:43.729
Shit!

893
00:58:45.814 --> 00:58:48.859
JIM: Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here,

894
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:51.028
let's power down everything

895
00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:54.197
so we can save as much
as we can for re-entry.

896
00:58:54.781 --> 00:58:56.616
Fifteen minutes
of oxygen, that's it.

897
00:58:56.658 --> 00:58:58.285
The command module will be dead.

898
00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:01.288
Okay, guys, listen up.
Here's the drill.

899
00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:03.457
We're moving the
astronauts to the LEM.

900
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.250
We've got to get
oxygen up there.

901
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:09.713
TELMU, Control, I want emergency
power procedure. Essential hardware only.

902
00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:13.508
GNC, EECOM, we'll be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

903
00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:16.303
We've to transfer the guidance
system to another computer.

904
00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:19.389
I want those numbers up and
ready when they're in position.

905
00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:22.309

907
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:26.396
The lunar module
just became a lifeboat.

908
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.358
Odyssey, this is Houston. We
need you to power down immediately.

909
00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:34.237
<i>Power up the LEM at the same
time, so get somebody over there.</i>

910
00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:36.823

915
00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:48.877
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

916
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.131
We're looking at less than 15
minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

917
00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.514
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
It's worse than I thought.

<i>Houston, I've moved from the
command module into the LEM.</i>

919

If Jack can't get that data
transferred before they go dead...

920
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.026
They won't know which
way they're pointed.

921
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.194
That's a bad way to fly.

922
01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.570

931
01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:44.641

932
01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.685

933
01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.854

Yes!

No, sir! We get them on
a free-return trajectory.

1063
01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:02.203
It's the option with the fewest
question marks for safety.

1064
01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:05.415
I agree. We use the moon's
gravity to slingshot them around.

1065
01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:09.168
No, the LEM will not support
three guys for that amount of time.

1066
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.838
I think we've got to
do a direct abort.

1067
01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:14.215
We do an about-face,
bring the guys right home.

1068
01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:15.883
Get them back soon.
Absolutely.

1069
01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:18.261
We don't even know if the
Odyssey's engine's working.

1070
01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.388
If there's been serious
damage to the craft...

1071
01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:21.806
They blow up and they die!

1072
01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:24.392
That is not the argument!
We're talking about time!

1073
01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:25.977
Not whether these guys...

I'm not gonna
sugarcoat this for you!

1075
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.148
Okay, hold it.
Let's hold it down.

1076
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:33.651
The only engine we've got with
enough power for a direct abort

1077
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.862
is the SPS on
the service module.

1078
01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:38.406
It could have been damaged
in an explosion,

1079
01:08:38.489 --> 01:08:40.283
so let's consider
that engine dead.

1080
01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.368
We light it up, could
blow the whole works.

1081
01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:45.330
Just too risky. We're not
gonna take that chance.

1082
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.790
The only thing the command
module's good for is re-entry.

1083
01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:51.753
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

1084
01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:54.172
Once we get the guys
around the moon,

1085
01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:56.549
we'll fire up the LEM
engine, make a long burn,

1086

them home as quick as we can.

Gene, I'm wondering what the
Grumman guys think about this.

1088
01:09:03.222 --> 01:09:05.433
We can't make any guarantees.

1089
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:07.518
We designed the LEM
to land on the moon,

1090
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.729
not fire the engine
for course corrections.

1091
01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:13.608
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

1092
01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.612
I don't care what anything
was designed to do.

1093
01:09:17.695 --> 01:09:19.781

1094
01:09:19.864 --> 01:09:22.784
So let's get to work.
Let's lay it out, okay?

it will be ready in time.

1175
01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.746
They're not gonna
make it to re-entry.

1176
01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:42.931
What do you mean, "everything"?

1177
01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:45.499
If everything's on,
the LEM draws 60 amps.

1178
01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:49.128
At that rate, in 16 hours the
batteries are dead, not 45.

1179
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.465
And so is the crew. We gotta
get them down to 12 amps.

1180
01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:54.133
- Twelve amps?
- ENGINEER: How many?

1181
01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:56.510
You can't run a vacuum
cleaner on 12 amps, John.

1182
01:15:56.594 --> 01:16:00.514
We gotta turn off
the radars, cabin heater,

1183
01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:02.767
instrument displays,
guidance computer, everything.

1184
01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:05.728
Guidance computer? What if
they need to do another burn?

1185
01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.330
They won't know which
way they're pointed.

1186
01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:09.648
The more time we talk,
the more juice they waste.

1187
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.126
I've looked at data
for the past hour.

1188
01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.151
That's the deal?

1189
01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.819
That's the deal.

1190
01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:23.329
Okay, John. The minute we finish
the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1191
01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.747
All right.

1192
01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.416
Now, in the meantime,

1193
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.294
we're gonna have a frozen
command module up there.

1194
01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:31.837
Soon, we'll have to power it up

1195
01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.315
using nothing but
the re-entry batteries.

1196
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:34.673
That's never been tried before.

1197
01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.301
We've never even
simulated it before.

1198
01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:39.887
Well, we're gonna
have to figure it out.

1199
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:43.349
I want people in our simulators
working re-entry scenarios.

1200
01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.560
I want you to find every engineer
who designed every switch, circuit,

1201
01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.187
transistor and
light bulb up there.

1202
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:52.066
Then, talk to the guy in the assembly
line who actually built the thing.

1203
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:56.487
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1204
01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:01.117
I want this mark all the way
back to Earth with time to spare.

1205
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.744
We never lost an
American in space.

1206
01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.372
We're sure as hell not
gonna lose one on my watch.

1207
01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.040
Failure is not an option.

1213
01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:27.143
I gotta get you in the
simulator. We got a ship to land.

1214
01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.227
What?

1215
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.728
There's been an explosion.

1216
01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:33.732
Oxygen tanks are gone, two fuel cells
gone, command module's shut down.

1217
01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:34.900
What about the crew?

1218
01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:35.943
Crew's fine so far.

1219
01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:38.195
Trying to keep them
alive in the LEM.

1220
01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.240
We'll have to shut that
down pretty soon, too.

1221
01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:44.285
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one.

1222
01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:47.079
Nobody's too sure how much
power we'll have for re-entry.

1223
01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:50.708
The command module will be
frozen up pretty good by then.

1224
01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:55.045
If you see this ammeter rise over
20 at any point, power-up is no good.

1225
01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:57.232
If it spikes, that's <i>sayonara</i>
for the guidance computer.

1226
01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:59.216
Our guys can't re-enter, okay?

1227
01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.635
FRANK: How much power
do we have to play with?

1228
01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.388
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours. Go.

losing heat since the accident.

1232
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:13.689
They'll start getting water
condensation on the control panels.

1233

know what's going on?

1234

What's left in the batteries?

1236
01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:19.778
We don't know.

1237
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.072
We gotta get started on
some shortcuts for power-up.

1238
01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:23.741
You know how short?

1239
01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:27.620
It's all in the sequencing. If we can
skip whatever we don't absolutely need,

1240
01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.222
turn things on in
the right order, maybe...

1241
01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:30.289
I agree.

1242
01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.457

- I need a flashlight.

1250

That's not what
they have up there.

1251
01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:49.934
Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

JACK: What's up?

1262
01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:19.838
No more waste dumps. We're
just gonna have to store it.

1263
01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:23.175

leaves us with just the computer,

I never dreamed I'd ever
get to do something like this.

1339
01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:21.139
Come up here on a real mission.

1340
01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:24.560
Most of the guys I
graduated high school with

1341
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:27.020
never even left home,
and here I am.

1342
01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:28.355
Oh, yeah.

1343
01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.358
Here you are.

1344
01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.824
It hurts when I urinate.

1345
01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.219
Well, you're not
getting enough water.

1346
01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.870
I'm drinking my ration
the same as you.

1347
01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:50.168
I think old Swigert
gave me the clap.

1348
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.839
He's been pissing
in my relief tube.

1349
01:24:57.092 --> 01:25:00.804
Well, that will be a hot one at
the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1350
01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:04.850
That's another first for
America's space program.

1351
01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:12.107
Listen, I've been
going over some stuff,

1352
01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:17.362
and I'm a little worried about this
cold affecting our battery efficiency.

1353
01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:22.159
We quit heating the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1354
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.286
JIM: It could cost us amp
hours on the back end?

1355
01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:25.746
FRED:
That's a possibility.

1356
01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.540
I've been going
over the numbers again.

1357
01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:31.311
Have they called up with a re-entry
plan yet? We're coming in too shallow...

1358
01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:33.128
We're working on it.

1359
01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:35.380
I can't remember the
ratio to temperature.

1360
01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.840
We got no references on board.

1361
01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:39.051
Let's see if Houston can
pull up the mil specs...

1362
01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:43.055
Listen, they gave us too much
Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1363
01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:47.476
At this rate we'll skip right out of
the atmosphere, and never get back.

1364
01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:50.562
What are you talking about?
How'd you figure that?

1365
01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:51.980
I can add.

1366
01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.401
Many PhDs are working on this.

1367
01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:57.754
Houston says we're on the money.

1368
01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.280
What if they made a mistake
and there was no way to reverse it?

1369
01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.573
You think they'd tell us?

1370
01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.991
There's no reason to tell us!

1371
01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:04.826
What do you mean?
That's bullshit!

1372
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:07.704
There's 1,000 things that
have to happen in order.

1373
01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:10.290
We are on number eight.

1374
01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:12.918
You're talking about number 692.

1375
01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:15.837
In the meantime, I'm trying to
tell you we're coming in too fast.

1376
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:19.424
I think they know it, and that's
why we don't have a re-entry plan.

1377
01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:21.927
That's duly noted.
Thank you, Jack.

1378
01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:25.055
(YELLS) God damn
this piece of shit!

1379
01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.100
This piece of shit's
gonna get you home.

1380
01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:31.728
That's because that's the
only thing we've got left, Jack!

1381
01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:34.231
What are you saying, Fred?

1382
01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:36.608
FRED: I think you know
what I'm saying.

1383
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:40.112
Now wait a minute. All I
did was stir those tanks.

1384
01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.964
What was the gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1385
01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:44.116
Don't tell me how to fly the CM!

1386
01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:45.826
They brought me in to do a job!

1387
01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:49.246
They asked me to stir the damn
tanks, and I stirred the tanks!

1388
01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.747
Stop kicking
yourself in the ass.

1389
01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:51.957
This is not my fault!

1390
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.959
No one is saying it is.

1391
01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:57.963
If I'm in the left-hand seat when
the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1392
01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.131
Well, tell him that.

1393
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:02.050
I just asked you what the gauge
was reading, and you don't know!

1394
01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.344
Look, we're not
doing this, gentlemen.

1395
01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:07.222
We're not bouncing off
the walls for 10 minutes

1396
01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:10.350
because we'll just end up
with the same problems!

1397

looking at that.

1404
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:35.375

jumped four notches in the last hour.

1405
01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:38.670
That can't be right. I went
over those numbers three times.

you over budget on amps.

1699
01:44:28.512 --> 01:44:29.638

1700

Fine. Then trade off
the parachutes.

it loose. Why can't we do that?

Thanks, Jackie.

1832
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:50.245
I think it would really
help if you could

1833
01:51:50.287 --> 01:51:54.708
just distract her when the
heavy predictions come in.

1834
01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:56.752
We'll give it a shot.

Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch television with you.

1837
01:52:03.634 --> 01:52:06.011

Are you boys in
the space program, too?

1841
01:52:13.227 --> 01:52:16.813
Okay, Jack, give me a
read-back on that last procedure.

1842
01:52:17.147 --> 01:52:18.649
Stand by, Ken.

1843
01:52:22.444 --> 01:52:26.657
Ken, I'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

01:52:26.782 --> 01:52:30.077

more tired than I thought.

1845
01:52:35.123 --> 01:52:37.751
Don't worry, Jack.
I'll talk you through it.

1846

Find the main bus
breakers on panel 11.

1847

they be underweight?

1860

1999
02:01:41.878 --> 02:01:43.505
JACK: I was
getting a little punchy

2000
02:01:43.546 --> 02:01:47.300
and I didn't want to cut the
LEM loose with you guys still in it.

2001
02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.261
That's good thinking.

2002
02:01:50.345 --> 02:01:51.513
(CHUCKLES)

2003
02:01:52.472 --> 02:01:54.224

Flight 966406.

2009
02:02:52.949 --> 02:02:54.117
Let me put it this way.

2010
02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.036
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

2011
02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.289
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

2012
02:02:59.372 --> 02:03:01.124
Their heat shield
could be cracked.

2013
02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:04.127
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

2014
02:03:04.252 --> 02:03:06.296
Clearly, we have some
obstacles to overcome.

2015
02:03:06.379 --> 02:03:09.465
But now I'm asking you,
when will we know?

2016
02:03:10.508 --> 02:03:11.968
Blackout lasts
for three minutes.

2017
02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:15.179
If they're not back
in four, we'll know.

2018
02:03:16.764 --> 02:03:20.602
Velocity now reading
34,802 feet per second.

2019
02:03:20.727 --> 02:03:22.645
Range to go
2,625 nautical miles.

2020
02:03:22.687 --> 02:03:23.688
Copy that.

2021
02:03:24.647 --> 02:03:27.150
Okay, Ken, we are
aligned for re-entry.

2022
02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:29.360
Jim, we need that
computer re-entry program.

2023
02:03:29.444 --> 02:03:31.112
Fred, how are
the batteries looking?

2024
02:03:31.154 --> 02:03:32.280
Okay.

2025
02:03:33.323 --> 02:03:34.407
Batt A looks good.

2026

<i>KEN: Re-entry

<i>and 30 seconds.</i>

2028
02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:40.163
Batt B, no volts,
the amps are okay.

2029
02:03:41.289 --> 02:03:42.624
FRED: Batt C...

2030
02:03:43.666 --> 02:03:45.668
No volts, only two amps.

2031
02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:49.505
It may die before
the main chutes open.

2032
02:03:49.797 --> 02:03:52.634
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

2033
02:03:52.675 --> 02:03:56.220
They're still shallowing a bit up
there. Do you want to tell them?

2034
02:03:57.096 --> 02:03:58.490
Is there anything
we can do about it?

2035
02:03:58.514 --> 02:03:59.849
<i>RETRO: Not now, Flight.</i>

2036
02:03:59.974 --> 02:04:01.201
Then they don't
need to know, do they?

2037
02:04:01.225 --> 02:04:02.393
<i>RETRO: Copy that.</i>

2038
02:04:02.477 --> 02:04:06.230
HENRY: RETRO says the typhoon is
still a presence in the splashdown area?

2039
02:04:06.314 --> 02:04:09.192
We got the parachute situation,

2040
02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:11.778
heat shield, angle of
trajectory, and a typhoon.

2041
02:04:11.861 --> 02:04:13.339
There are so many
variables, I'm at a loss...

2042
02:04:13.363 --> 02:04:15.782
I know what the problems are.

2043
02:04:15.865 --> 02:04:18.868
This could be the worst
disaster NASA has experienced.

2044
02:04:18.952 --> 02:04:23.539
With all due respect, sir, I believe
this is going to be our finest hour.

2045
02:04:36.511 --> 02:04:39.138
Expect entry
interface in 45 seconds.

2046
02:04:40.056 --> 02:04:42.183

2047
02:04:42.225 --> 02:04:45.478

it's been a privilege
flying with you.

2051
02:05:41.451 --> 02:05:43.453
Flight, we have
loss of radio contact.

2052

Roger that.

2053
02:05:44.954 --> 02:05:47.540
Expect to regain signal
in three minutes.

2054
02:05:51.127 --> 02:05:52.962
It all depends
on the heat shield.
