1
00:00:12.805 --> 00:00:16.309
Cinderella.

2
00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:19.854
You're as lovely as your name.

3
00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:23.024
Cinderella.

4
00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:27.654
You're a sunset in a frame.

5
00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:30.532
Though you're dressed in rags.

6
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:35.537
You wear an air of queenly grace.

7
00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:37.997
Anyone can see.

8
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:43.711
A throne would be your proper place.

9
00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:47.048
Cinderella.

10
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.552
If you give your heart a chance.

11
00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:53.680
It will lead you.

12
00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:58.101
To the kingdom of romance.

13
00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:04.399
There you'll see your dreams unfold.

14
00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:09.654
Cinderella.

15
00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:13.032
Cinderella.

16
00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:15.868
In the sweetest story.

17
00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:20.248
Ever told.

18
00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:39.142
Once upon a time,
in a faraway land,

19
00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:41.185
there was a tiny kingdom,

20
00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:47.150
peaceful, prosperous,
and rich in romance and tradition.

21
00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:53.489
Here, in a stately chateau,

22
00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:55.450
there lived a widowed gentleman

23
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.785
and his little daughter, Cinderella.

24
00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:02.540
Although he was
a kind and devoted father,

25
00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:05.793
and gave his beloved child
every luxury and comfort,

26
00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:09.088
still he felt she needed
a mother's care.

27
00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:10.923
And so, he married again,

28
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.594
choosing for his second wife
a woman of good family,

29
00:02:14.677 --> 00:02:17.430
with two daughters
Just Cinderella's age,

30
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:21.184
by name, Anastasia and Drizella.

31
00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:27.065
It was upon the untimely death
of this good man, however,

32
00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:29.984
that the stepmother's
true nature was revealed.

33
00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:32.654
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous

34
00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:34.739
of Cinderella's charm and beauty,

35
00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:37.408
she was grimly determined
to forward the interests

36
00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:39.494
of her own two awkward daughters.

37
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.957
Thus, as time went by,

38
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.210
the chateau fell into disrepair.

39
00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:49.295
For the family fortunes
were squandered

40
00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.756
upon the vain and selfish stepsisters,

41
00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.093
while Cinderella was abused,
humiliated,

42
00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:58.638
and finally forced
to become a servant in her own house.

43
00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.558
And yet, through it all,

44
00:03:02.642 --> 00:03:06.270
Cinderella remained
ever gentle and kind.

45
00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:09.899
For with each dawn,
she found new hope that someday

46
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:12.443
her dreams of happiness
would come true.

47
00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.738
Well, it serves you right,
spoiling people's best dreams.

48
00:03:58.114 --> 00:04:00.491
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning,

49
00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:03.202
but it was a lovely dream, too.

50
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.959
What kind of a dream?

51
00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:12.211
Can't tell.

52
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:18.176
'Cause if you tell a wish,
it won't come true.

53
00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.427
And, after all...

54
00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:24.390
A dream is a wish.

55
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:28.728
Your heart makes.

56
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:34.525
When you're fast asleep.

57
00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:38.696
In dreams you will lose.

58
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.115
Your heartaches.

59
00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:46.704
Whatever you wish for.

60
00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:47.997
You keep.

61
00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:52.585
Have faith.

62
00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:58.508
In your dreams and someday.

63
00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:05.848
Your rainbow
will come smiling through.

64
00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:12.355
No matter how your heart is grieving.

65
00:05:13.523 --> 00:05:17.777
If you keep on believing.

66
00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:22.949
The dream that you wish.

67
00:05:23.032 --> 00:05:28.412
Will come true.

68
00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:31.749
Oh, that clock.

69
00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:34.585
Old killjoy.

70
00:05:35.628 --> 00:05:38.256
I hear you. "Come on, get up," you say.

71
00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:41.676
Time to start another day.

72
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.970
Even he orders me around.

73
00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:47.348
Well, there's one thing.

74
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:50.810
They can't order me to stop dreaming.

75
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:53.729
And perhaps someday...

76
00:05:53.813 --> 00:05:57.650
The dreams that I wish.

77
00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:03.030
Will come true.

78
00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:14.060
No matter how your heart is grieving.

79
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:19.649
If you keep on believing.

80
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.153
The dream that you wish.

81
00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:29.450
Will come true.

82
00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:32.286
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.

83
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.413
Wait a minute.

84
00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:36.207
One at a time, please.

85
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.960
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?

86
00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:40.378
New mouse in the house.

87
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.338
Brand-new. Never saw it before.

88
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:45.007
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.

89
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:47.551
Well, she'll need a dress...

90
00:07:49.053 --> 00:07:51.138
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.

91
00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:53.933
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.

92
00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:57.937
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!

93
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.064
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?

94
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.692
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?

95
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.583
Now, now, calm down, everybody.

96
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:24.422
Oh, the poor little thing's
scared to death.

97
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:27.383
Jag, maybe you better
explain things to him.

98
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:29.802
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.

99
00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:32.555
Now, now. Look, little guy.

100
00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:35.391
Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about.

101
00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:38.144
We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too.

102
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:39.895
She's nice, very nice.

103
00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:43.357
That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk.

104
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:45.401
Zuk, zuk.

105
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:49.905
Well, that's better.

106
00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:55.119
Well, let's just slip it on for size.

107
00:08:57.079 --> 00:09:00.166
It is a little snug.

108
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:02.043
But it'll have to do.

109
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.086
Now, for a name.

110
00:09:04.837 --> 00:09:07.923
I've got one. Octavius.

111
00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:10.426
But for short, we'll call you Gus.

112
00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.012
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?

113
00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:15.097
Gus-Gus.

114
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:18.059
I've got to hurry.
See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq.

115
00:09:18.142 --> 00:09:20.853
And don't forget
to warn him about the cat.

116
00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:23.814
Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat?

117
00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:25.441
Cat, cat?

118
00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:27.818
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.

119
00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.529
Meany, sneaky.

120
00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:32.615
Jump at you. Bite at you.

121
00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:36.368
Big, big. Big as a house.

122
00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:37.870
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?

123
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.247
Lucify, zuk, zuk.

124
00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:13.906
Here, kitty, kitty.

125
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.370
Come, kitty. Come on.

126
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:25.668
Lucifer! Come here!

127
00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:47.314
I'm sorry if Your Highness
objects to an early breakfast.

128
00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:50.776
It's certainly not my idea
to feed you first.

129
00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:54.155
It's orders. Come on.

130
00:10:55.406 --> 00:10:57.908
Lucify. Is that Lucify?

131
00:10:57.992 --> 00:10:59.743
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.

132
00:11:01.287 --> 00:11:06.292
Gus-Gus take the Lucify and look at!

133
00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:07.668
No, Gus-Gus, no.

134
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.962
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.

135
00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.755
Lucify mean.

136
00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:27.479
Bruno.

137
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:30.608
Bruno!

138
00:11:37.573 --> 00:11:39.366
Dreaming again.

139
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.911
Chasing Lucifer?

140
00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:44.872
Catch him this time? That's bad.

141
00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:50.169
Suppose they heard you upstairs.

142
00:11:50.252 --> 00:11:51.837
You know the orders.

143
00:11:52.588 --> 00:11:55.549
So if you don't want
to lose that nice, warm bed,

144
00:11:55.633 --> 00:11:58.177
you'd better get rid of those dreams.

145
00:11:58.761 --> 00:12:00.012
Know how?

146
00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:03.349
Just learn to like cats.

147
00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:09.855
No, I mean it.
Lucifer has his good points, too.

148
00:12:09.939 --> 00:12:11.899
For one thing, he...

149
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.863
Well, sometimes he...

150
00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:22.534
There must be
something good about him.

151
00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:37.883
Bruno!

152
00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:40.052
Oh, Bruno.

153
00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:43.097
Come on, now. Outside.

154
00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.310
I know it isn't easy,

155
00:12:48.394 --> 00:12:51.563
but at least we should try
to get along together.

156
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:56.527
And that includes you, Your Majesty.

157
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.247
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.

158
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.417
Come on, everybody,
breakfast, breakfast.

159
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.752
Come on, let's eat breakfast.

160
00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:17.006
Breakfast? Breakfast!

161
00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:31.228
Lucify. How're we gonna get out?

162
00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:36.108
Let's see.

163
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:39.862
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.

164
00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:43.115
Now, somebody's got to sneak out,

165
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.742
get Lucify to chase him,

166
00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:47.995
run over to the corner
and keep Lucify there.

167
00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:49.830
Then we all run out. Zuk.

168
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.498
Yuk, yuk. Out.

169
00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:55.169
Now we choose the one to do it.
Ibby-dibby hop.

170
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:56.920
- Hop.
- Hop.

171
00:13:57.004 --> 00:13:58.630
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.

172
00:13:58.714 --> 00:13:59.882
Hop.

173
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:03.260
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.

174
00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:05.054
Hop.

175
00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:54.872
Oh, there you are.

176
00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:56.748
I was wondering.

177
00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:59.418
All right. Breakfast is served.

178
00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:14.141
Take it easy, cluck-cluck.

179
00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:19.021
Let go! Let go, now.

180
00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:23.734
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.

181
00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.861
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

182
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:29.198
Poor little Gus.

183
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.033
Here.

184
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.618
Help yourself.

185
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.429
Where's Gus-Gus?

186
00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.472
Well, guess he got away.

187
00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:38.910
Cinderella!

188
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.248
All right, all right. I'm coming.

189
00:18:43.332 --> 00:18:46.168
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.

190
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.503
Cinderella!

191
00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:50.130
Coming, coming.

192
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.185
- Cinderellal!
- I'm coming.

193
00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:15.947
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.

194
00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:19.201
Cinderella!

195
00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:33.882
Cinderella!

196
00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:14.172
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?

197
00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:16.091
As if you care.

198
00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.510
Take that ironing
and have it back in an hour.

199
00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:20.470
One hour, you hear?

200
00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:22.055
Yes, Drizella.

201
00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.565
Good morning, Anastasia.

202
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.650
Well, it's about time.

203
00:20:33.734 --> 00:20:35.902
Don't forget the mending.

204
00:20:35.986 --> 00:20:38.363
Don't be all day getting it done, either.

205
00:20:38.447 --> 00:20:40.741
Yes, Anastasia.

206
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.787
Well, come in, child, come in.

207
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:47.205
Good morning, Stepmother.

208
00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:50.041
Pick up the laundry
and get on with your duties.

209
00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.710
Yes, Stepmother.

210
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:09.895
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!

211
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:12.063
Mother! Mother!

212
00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:14.107
You did it. You did it on purpose.

213
00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:16.568
Mother! Mother! Mother!

214
00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:19.070
Now what did you do?

215
00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.572
She put it there.

216
00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:23.909
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.

217
00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:28.246
All right, Lucifer.
What did you do with him?

218
00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:31.458
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.

219
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.543
We'll just see about this.

220
00:21:33.627 --> 00:21:36.087
Come on. Let him go.

221
00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:38.089
Now the other one.

222
00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:39.424
Come on!

223
00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:42.344
Oh, poor little Gus.

224
00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:50.185
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?

225
00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.937
Cinderella!

226
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.647
Yes, Stepmother.

227
00:21:57.818 --> 00:22:00.070
Are you gonna get it.

228
00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:02.948
Close the door, Cinderella.

229
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:10.997
Come here.

230
00:22:25.345 --> 00:22:28.181
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.

231
00:22:29.558 --> 00:22:30.725
Now,

232
00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:35.397
it seems we have time on our hands.

233
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.649
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!

234
00:22:40.861 --> 00:22:43.196
Time for vicious practical jokes.

235
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:47.325
Perhaps we can put it to better use.

236
00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:49.077
Now, let me see...

237
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:53.373
There's the large carpet
in the main hall.

238
00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:55.375
Clean it!

239
00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:58.503
And the windows, upstairs and down.

240
00:22:58.587 --> 00:23:00.005
Wash them!

241
00:23:01.256 --> 00:23:05.010
Oh, yes.
And the tapestries and the draperies.

242
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:07.596
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!

243
00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:10.432
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.

244
00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:13.351
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.

245
00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:17.480
And, of course, there's the mending and
the sewing and the laundry.

246
00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:23.778
Oh, yes. And one more thing.

247
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.490
See that Lucifer gets his bath.

248
00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.472
My son has been avoiding his
responsibilities long enough.

249
00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:53.850
It's high time he married
and settled down.

250
00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:56.436
Of course, Your Majesty.

251
00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.229
But we must be patient.

252
00:23:58.313 --> 00:24:00.523
I am patient!

253
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.279
But I'm not getting any younger,
you know.

254
00:24:06.363 --> 00:24:09.574
I want to see my grandchildren
before I go.

255
00:24:09.658 --> 00:24:12.410
- I understand, Sire.
- No.

256
00:24:12.494 --> 00:24:16.831
No, you don't know
what it means to see your only child

257
00:24:16.915 --> 00:24:21.795
grow farther, farther,
and farther away from you.

258
00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:24.297
I'm...

259
00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:27.509
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.

260
00:24:27.592 --> 00:24:29.761
I... I want to hear

261
00:24:29.844 --> 00:24:33.348
the pitter-patter of little feet again.

262
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:36.518
Now, now, Your Majesty.

263
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:41.356
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?

264
00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:45.318
With his silly romantic ideas?

265
00:24:45.402 --> 00:24:48.279
But, Sire, in matters of love...

266
00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:49.990
Love.

267
00:24:50.073 --> 00:24:54.619
Just a boy meeting a girl
under the right conditions.

268
00:24:54.703 --> 00:24:57.497
So, we're arranging the conditions.

269
00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.375
But, Your Majesty,
if the Prince should suspect.

270
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:02.252
Suspect!

271
00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:05.088
Look, the boy's coming home today,
isn't he?

272
00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:06.171
Yes, Sire.

273
00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:10.343
Well, what could be more natural than a
ball to celebrate his return?

274
00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:12.303
Nothing, Sire.

275
00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:16.349
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just

276
00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:19.728
happened to be there,

277
00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:24.065
why, he's bound to show interest
in one of them, isn't he?

278
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:25.817
Isn't he?

279
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.485
Yes, Sire.

280
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.070
The moment he does...

281
00:25:29.988 --> 00:25:32.407
Soft lights.

282
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.076
Romantic music.

283
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.579
All the trimmings!

284
00:25:38.496 --> 00:25:40.415
It can't possibly fail.

285
00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:43.043
Can it?

286
00:25:43.668 --> 00:25:45.628
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!

287
00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:48.006
Very well, Sire.

288
00:25:48.089 --> 00:25:49.758
I shall arrange the ball for...

289
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:52.385
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!

290
00:25:52.469 --> 00:25:54.095
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!

291
00:25:54.179 --> 00:25:57.640
And see that every
eligible maid is there.

292
00:25:57.724 --> 00:26:00.185
Understand?

293
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.105
Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:08.109
The pear-shaped toad.

295
00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:14.157
Sing, sweet nightingale.

296
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.827
Sing, sweet nightingale.

297
00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:20.955
High.

298
00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:23.875
Above me.

299
00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:28.046
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale.

300
00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:31.299
Sing, sweet nightingale.

301
00:26:31.382 --> 00:26:35.303
High.

302
00:26:35.386 --> 00:26:39.390
Above.

303
00:26:39.474 --> 00:26:42.894
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale.

304
00:26:42.977 --> 00:26:46.773
Sing, sweet nightingale.

305
00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:52.153
High.

306
00:26:54.322 --> 00:26:58.243
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale.

307
00:26:58.326 --> 00:27:01.788
Sing, sweet.

308
00:27:01.871 --> 00:27:05.583
Nightingale.

309
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:10.630
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale.

310
00:27:10.713 --> 00:27:15.009
Sing, sweet.

311
00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:19.305
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale.

312
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:22.058
Sing.

313
00:27:23.852 --> 00:27:28.106
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale.

314
00:27:28.189 --> 00:27:33.194
Oh, sing, sweet.

315
00:27:37.073 --> 00:27:40.326
Sing

316
00:27:41.286 --> 00:27:43.621
Lucifer!

317
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:48.251
You mean old thing.

318
00:27:50.545 --> 00:27:52.380
I'm just going to have to
teach you a lesson.

319
00:27:54.257 --> 00:27:56.384
Open in the name of the King.

320
00:27:57.969 --> 00:28:00.597
An urgent message
from His Imperial Majesty.

321
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.349
- Thank you.
- From the King!

322
00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:05.560
What's it say, Cinderelly?

323
00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:06.936
What's it say, huh?

324
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.479
I don't know.

325
00:28:08.563 --> 00:28:10.690
He said it's urgent.

326
00:28:12.817 --> 00:28:15.445
Maybe I should interrupt
the music lesson.

327
00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:18.406
Sing, sweet nightingale.

328
00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:21.618
Sing, sweet nightingale.

329
00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:24.829
High.

330
00:28:24.913 --> 00:28:27.081
High.

331
00:28:28.583 --> 00:28:30.919
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.

332
00:28:31.294 --> 00:28:34.756
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember,

333
00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:37.091
above all, self-control.

334
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:40.345
Yes!

335
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:44.515
Cinderella!
I've warned you never to interrupt...

336
00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:47.477
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!

337
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.062
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.

338
00:28:50.104 --> 00:28:51.481
I'll read it.

339
00:28:52.148 --> 00:28:54.734
Well, there's to be a ball.

340
00:28:54.817 --> 00:28:57.487
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.

341
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.988
Oh, the Prince!

342
00:28:59.072 --> 00:29:01.282
And, by royal command,

343
00:29:01.366 --> 00:29:04.369
every eligible maiden is to attend.

344
00:29:04.452 --> 00:29:06.871
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.

345
00:29:09.249 --> 00:29:11.709
That means I can go, too.

346
00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:14.837
Her, dancing with the Prince.

347
00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:17.090
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.

348
00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:19.926
Would you mind holding my broom?

349
00:29:23.304 --> 00:29:25.306
Well, why not?

350
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:29.435
After all, I'm still a
member of the family.

351
00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:32.397
And it says, "By royal command,

352
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.191
"every eligible maiden is to attend."

353
00:29:35.275 --> 00:29:38.027
Yes, so it does.

354
00:29:39.737 --> 00:29:42.907
Well, I see no reason why you can't go.

355
00:29:42.991 --> 00:29:45.326
If you get all your work done.

356
00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.203
Oh, I will. I promise.

357
00:29:47.287 --> 00:29:50.873
And if you can find
something suitable to wear.

358
00:29:50.957 --> 00:29:54.294
I'm sure I can.
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.

359
00:29:54.377 --> 00:29:57.922
Mother, do you realise
what you just said?

360
00:29:58.006 --> 00:29:59.674
Of course.

361
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:02.510
I said "if."

362
00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:05.305
Oh. "If."

363
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.940
Isn't it lovely?

364
00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:18.693
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.

365
00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:23.364
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned,
but I'll fix that.

366
00:30:23.448 --> 00:30:26.326
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.

367
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:29.620
There ought to be
some good ideas in here.

368
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:32.332
This one.

369
00:30:32.415 --> 00:30:33.750
Oh, very nice. Nice.

370
00:30:33.833 --> 00:30:35.585
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.

371
00:30:35.668 --> 00:30:38.629
I'll have to shorten the sleeves,
I'll need a sash,

372
00:30:38.713 --> 00:30:41.591
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!

373
00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:44.010
Oh, now what do they want?

374
00:30:44.093 --> 00:30:45.428
Cinderella!

375
00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:47.972
Oh, well.

376
00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:50.016
I guess my dress will just have to wait.

377
00:30:50.099 --> 00:30:51.726
Cinderella!

378
00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:53.394
Cinderella!

379
00:30:53.478 --> 00:30:55.938
All right, all right. I'm coming.

380
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:01.319
Poor Cinderelly.

381
00:31:01.402 --> 00:31:05.073
Every time she finds a minute,
that's the time when they begin it.

382
00:31:05.156 --> 00:31:07.075
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.

383
00:31:07.158 --> 00:31:08.951
Cinderella!

384
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:13.998
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly.

385
00:31:14.082 --> 00:31:16.042
Make the fire Fix the breakfast.

386
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:17.919
Wash the dishes Do the moppin'

387
00:31:18.002 --> 00:31:19.962
And the sweepin' and the Dustin'

388
00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:21.756
They always keep her hoppin'

389
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:23.299
She'd go around in circles.

390
00:31:23.383 --> 00:31:25.218
Till she's very, very dizzy.

391
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:29.764
- Still they holler.
- Keep her busy, Cinderelly.

392
00:31:29.847 --> 00:31:31.933
Yeah. Keep her busy.

393
00:31:34.769 --> 00:31:36.437
You know what?

394
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:39.607
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?

395
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.442
- Not go?
- What did you say?

396
00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:45.613
You'll see. They'll fix her.

397
00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:51.119
Work, work, work.
She'll never get her dress done.

398
00:31:51.702 --> 00:31:53.830
Poor Cinderelly.

399
00:31:55.665 --> 00:31:57.625
Hey! We can do it!

400
00:31:57.708 --> 00:31:59.794
We can do it We can do it.

401
00:31:59.877 --> 00:32:03.381
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make the dress so pretty.

402
00:32:03.464 --> 00:32:05.216
There's nothing to it, really.

403
00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:09.053
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it.

404
00:32:09.137 --> 00:32:12.557
When dancing at the ball
she'll be more beautiful than all.

405
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.269
In the lovely dress
we make for Cinderelly.

406
00:32:16.394 --> 00:32:17.979
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

407
00:32:18.062 --> 00:32:19.814
Gonna help our Cinderelly.

408
00:32:19.897 --> 00:32:21.649
Got no time to dilly-dally.

409
00:32:21.732 --> 00:32:23.568
We got to get it goin'

410
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:25.528
I'll cut it with the scissors.

411
00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:27.196
And I can do the sewing.

412
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.323
Leave the sewing to the women.

413
00:32:29.407 --> 00:32:30.908
You go get some trimmin'.

414
00:32:30.992 --> 00:32:34.912
And we'll make
a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo.

415
00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:37.748
We'll make a lovely dress
for Cinderelly.

416
00:32:37.832 --> 00:32:40.126
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.

417
00:32:40.209 --> 00:32:42.628
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.

418
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.590
Cinderelly will be surprised.

419
00:32:45.673 --> 00:32:47.925
Surprised, surprised. Very surprised.

420
00:32:56.309 --> 00:32:58.978
And this, too, my slippers.
Don't forget...

421
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:01.439
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.

422
00:33:01.522 --> 00:33:04.859
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?

423
00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:06.736
- Yes?
- When you're through,

424
00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:09.614
and before you begin
your regular chores,

425
00:33:09.697 --> 00:33:11.449
I have a few little things.

426
00:33:11.532 --> 00:33:12.783
Very well.

427
00:33:12.867 --> 00:33:16.287
I don't see why everyone else
has nice things to wear,

428
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.456
and I always end up in these old rags.

429
00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:21.459
This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it.

430
00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:23.794
You should talk. These beads!

431
00:33:23.878 --> 00:33:25.213
I am sick of looking at them.

432
00:33:25.713 --> 00:33:27.924
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.

433
00:33:31.594 --> 00:33:33.638
Come on and be careful.

434
00:33:33.721 --> 00:33:37.058
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.

435
00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:49.028
We can use that, Gus-Gus.

436
00:33:49.403 --> 00:33:51.155
Pretty, pretty.

437
00:33:51.239 --> 00:33:53.449
Look out. Lucify!

438
00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:41.872
Beads!

439
00:34:41.956 --> 00:34:44.417
Very pretty beads!

440
00:36:48.541 --> 00:36:52.169
A dream is a wish your heart makes.

441
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:56.173
When you're fast asleep.

442
00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:59.885
In dreams you will lose
your heartaches.

443
00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:03.264
Whatever you wish for You keep.

444
00:37:13.441 --> 00:37:15.943
No matter how your heart is grieving.

445
00:37:16.152 --> 00:37:17.862
If you keep on believing.

446
00:37:17.945 --> 00:37:20.906
The dream that you wish will come true.

447
00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:36.422
Okay. One, two, three, four,

448
00:37:36.505 --> 00:37:38.424
five, six, seven, eight.

449
00:37:40.176 --> 00:37:43.596
Whatever you wish for you keep.

450
00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:46.849
All right.

451
00:37:49.185 --> 00:37:51.228
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.

452
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:52.688
Heave, ho.

453
00:37:55.983 --> 00:37:59.111
The dream that you wish will come true.

454
00:37:59.195 --> 00:38:01.489
Will come true.

455
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:04.176
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.

456
00:39:05.928 --> 00:39:07.555
Why, Cinderella,

457
00:39:07.638 --> 00:39:10.391
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.

458
00:39:10.474 --> 00:39:13.978
Not going? Oh, what a shame.

459
00:39:14.812 --> 00:39:17.398
But, of course, there will be other times.

460
00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:19.108
Yes. Good night.

461
00:39:30.035 --> 00:39:31.996
Oh, well.

462
00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:33.914
What's a royal ball?

463
00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:38.919
After all, I suppose
it would be frightfully dull,

464
00:39:39.003 --> 00:39:42.506
and boring, and completely...

465
00:39:43.257 --> 00:39:45.217
Completely wonderful.

466
00:39:53.434 --> 00:39:55.394
- It's my...
- Surprise!

467
00:39:55.477 --> 00:39:57.313
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

468
00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:00.858
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!

469
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:03.360
Well, I never dreamed it.

470
00:40:03.444 --> 00:40:06.030
It's such a surprise.

471
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.617
Oh, how can I ever...

472
00:40:10.326 --> 00:40:12.745
Oh, thank you so much.

473
00:40:19.793 --> 00:40:22.379
Remember, when you're
presented to His Highness,

474
00:40:22.463 --> 00:40:24.131
- be sure...
- Wait!

475
00:40:25.132 --> 00:40:26.926
Please, wait for me.

476
00:40:27.801 --> 00:40:31.055
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?

477
00:40:31.138 --> 00:40:33.015
Do you think it will do?

478
00:40:35.059 --> 00:40:36.769
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.

479
00:40:36.852 --> 00:40:39.021
- Oh, no.
- You can't!

480
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:40.522
Girls, please.

481
00:40:42.024 --> 00:40:44.526
After all, we did make a bargain.

482
00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:46.487
Didn't we, Cinderella?

483
00:40:48.322 --> 00:40:51.825
And I never go back on my word.

484
00:40:53.369 --> 00:40:55.579
How very clever.

485
00:40:55.663 --> 00:40:57.414
These beads,

486
00:40:57.498 --> 00:41:00.459
they give it just the right touch.

487
00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:03.087
Don't you think so, Drizella?

488
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.506
No, I don't. I think she's...

489
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:08.175
Why, you little thief!

490
00:41:08.926 --> 00:41:11.261
They're my beads. Give them here.

491
00:41:11.345 --> 00:41:12.763
Oh, no.

492
00:41:12.846 --> 00:41:14.974
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.

493
00:41:15.057 --> 00:41:17.851
- Mine!
- Oh, please.

494
00:41:17.935 --> 00:41:20.104
Please, no.

495
00:41:20.187 --> 00:41:21.689
Thief!

496
00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:25.859
Girls, girls.

497
00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:29.655
That's quite enough.
Hurry along now, both of you.

498
00:41:30.197 --> 00:41:32.825
I won't have you upsetting yourselves.

499
00:41:37.538 --> 00:41:38.914
Good night.

500
00:42:18.495 --> 00:42:23.792
You will lose your heartache.

501
00:42:23.876 --> 00:42:27.880
Whatever you wish for
You'll keep.

502
00:42:27.963 --> 00:42:30.674
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.

503
00:42:30.758 --> 00:42:35.095
Have faith in your dreams
and someday.

504
00:42:35.179 --> 00:42:37.389
It's just no use.

505
00:42:37.473 --> 00:42:39.975
Your rainbow
will come smiling through.

506
00:42:40.059 --> 00:42:41.810
No use at all.

507
00:42:42.853 --> 00:42:47.274
No matter how your heart is grieving.

508
00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:49.943
If you keep on believing

509
00:42:50.027 --> 00:42:53.030
I can't believe. Not any more.

510
00:42:53.113 --> 00:42:55.157
The dream that you wish.

511
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.367
Will come true.

512
00:42:57.451 --> 00:42:59.870
There's nothing left to believe in.

513
00:42:59.953 --> 00:43:01.205
Nothing.

514
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.791
Nothing, my dear?

515
00:43:03.874 --> 00:43:07.294
- Oh, now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.

516
00:43:07.377 --> 00:43:09.213
Nonsense, child!

517
00:43:09.296 --> 00:43:12.633
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.

518
00:43:12.716 --> 00:43:14.343
And here I am.

519
00:43:14.635 --> 00:43:18.097
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.

520
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.307
You can't go to the ball looking like that.

521
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.433
The ball?

522
00:43:21.517 --> 00:43:23.936
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.

523
00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:25.395
But we have to hurry,

524
00:43:25.479 --> 00:43:27.731
because even miracles take a little time.

525
00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:31.318
- Miracles?
- Watch.

526
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:34.363
What in the world did I do
with that magic wand? I was sure...

527
00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:35.614
Magic wand?

528
00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:37.282
That's strange.

529
00:43:37.366 --> 00:43:40.077
- I always...
- Then you must be...

530
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.288
Your fairy godmother? Of course.

531
00:43:43.372 --> 00:43:45.749
Where is that wand? I...

532
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:48.418
Oh! I forgot.

533
00:43:48.502 --> 00:43:50.003
I put it away.

534
00:43:52.673 --> 00:43:54.216
Look at what she did.

535
00:43:54.299 --> 00:43:55.759
How'd she do it?

536
00:43:55.843 --> 00:43:58.887
Now, let's see.

537
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:02.141
I'd say the first thing you need is

538
00:44:02.224 --> 00:44:04.560
- a pumpkin.
- A pumpkin?

539
00:44:04.643 --> 00:44:08.188
Now the magic words.

540
00:44:13.193 --> 00:44:18.115
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

541
00:44:18.198 --> 00:44:20.284
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

542
00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:22.411
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

543
00:44:22.494 --> 00:44:26.957
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

544
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.293
It'll do magic Believe it or not.

545
00:44:29.376 --> 00:44:31.461
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

546
00:44:31.545 --> 00:44:35.966
Now Sala-gadoola means
Menchika-boolaroo.

547
00:44:36.049 --> 00:44:38.468
But the thing-a-ma-bob
that does the job.

548
00:44:38.552 --> 00:44:41.180
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

549
00:44:41.263 --> 00:44:45.809
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

550
00:44:45.893 --> 00:44:47.978
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

551
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:51.940
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

552
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.693
Oh, looky.

553
00:44:54.776 --> 00:44:56.570
Isn't it wonderful?

554
00:44:57.404 --> 00:44:59.698
Oh, it's beautiful.

555
00:44:59.781 --> 00:45:02.201
Yes, isn't it?

556
00:45:02.284 --> 00:45:04.703
With an elegant coach like that,
of course,

557
00:45:04.786 --> 00:45:07.581
we'll simply have to have

558
00:45:07.915 --> 00:45:10.459
- mice!
- Mice?

559
00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:13.003
On, this really is nice.

560
00:45:13.086 --> 00:45:16.173
Why, we'll have a coach
and four when we're through.

561
00:45:16.256 --> 00:45:19.718
Just a wave of my stick
and to finish the trick,

562
00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:22.721
bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

563
00:45:22.804 --> 00:45:24.848
Gracious, what did I do?

564
00:45:24.932 --> 00:45:28.727
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.

565
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.812
There you are.

566
00:45:32.189 --> 00:45:34.316
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

567
00:45:44.618 --> 00:45:46.828
Oh, poor Lucifer.

568
00:45:46.912 --> 00:45:49.206
Serves him right, I'd say. Now...

569
00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:52.209
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.

570
00:45:52.292 --> 00:45:54.836
You can't go to the ball without

571
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.380
a horse.

572
00:45:56.463 --> 00:45:57.965
Another one?

573
00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:02.135
But tonight, for a change,
you will handle the reins,

574
00:46:02.219 --> 00:46:04.638
and sit in the driver's seat, too.

575
00:46:05.097 --> 00:46:08.684
For instead of a horse,
you're the coachman, of course.

576
00:46:08.767 --> 00:46:10.686
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

577
00:46:14.773 --> 00:46:18.235
That does it, I guess, except for...
Oh, yes!

578
00:46:18.318 --> 00:46:21.446
The finishing touch. And, that's you.

579
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:25.325
Yes, Bruno, that's right,
you'll be footman tonight.

580
00:46:25.659 --> 00:46:27.995
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

581
00:46:29.538 --> 00:46:31.999
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.

582
00:46:32.082 --> 00:46:34.793
- But...
- No, don't try to thank me.

583
00:46:34.876 --> 00:46:38.547
Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but...

584
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.299
But, don't you think my dress...

585
00:46:40.382 --> 00:46:43.218
Yes, it's lovely, dear.

586
00:46:43.302 --> 00:46:47.222
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!

587
00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:51.101
Now, let's see, dear.

588
00:46:51.184 --> 00:46:55.439
Your size and the shade of your eyes.

589
00:46:55.522 --> 00:46:58.650
Something simple, but daring, too.

590
00:46:58.734 --> 00:47:02.487
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.

591
00:47:02.946 --> 00:47:05.198
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.

592
00:47:05.282 --> 00:47:07.617
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

593
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.081
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.

594
00:47:13.165 --> 00:47:16.376
Did you ever see
such a beautiful dress?

595
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.212
And, look, glass slippers.

596
00:47:20.964 --> 00:47:23.133
Why, it's like a dream.

597
00:47:23.216 --> 00:47:26.136
A wonderful dream come true.

598
00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:27.804
Yes, my child.

599
00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:29.556
But, like all dreams,

600
00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:32.434
well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.

601
00:47:32.517 --> 00:47:34.561
You'll have only till midnight, and then...

602
00:47:34.644 --> 00:47:36.229
Midnight? Thank you.

603
00:47:36.313 --> 00:47:39.691
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear,

604
00:47:39.775 --> 00:47:42.986
on the stroke of 12:00
the spell will be broken,

605
00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.655
and everything will be as it was before.

606
00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:47.991
Oh, I understand, but

607
00:47:48.075 --> 00:47:50.744
it's more than I ever hoped for.

608
00:47:50.827 --> 00:47:52.537
Bless you, my child.

609
00:47:52.621 --> 00:47:55.123
I... Goodness me!

610
00:47:55.207 --> 00:47:58.460
It's getting late.
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.

611
00:47:58.585 --> 00:48:00.879
Have a good time.
Dance, be gay.

612
00:48:00.962 --> 00:48:03.131
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.

613
00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:05.509
With a bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi.

614
00:48:05.592 --> 00:48:07.260
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

615
00:48:35.163 --> 00:48:38.917
Princess Frederic a
Eugenie de la Fontain.

616
00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:46.091
Mademoiselle Augustina Dubois.

617
00:48:46.174 --> 00:48:49.594
Daughter of General Pierre Dubois.

618
00:49:00.147 --> 00:49:02.983
The boy isn't cooperating.

619
00:49:03.817 --> 00:49:07.946
Mademoiselle Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.

620
00:49:08.029 --> 00:49:12.451
Daughter of Colonel
and Madame de la Tour.

621
00:49:18.999 --> 00:49:21.501
I can't understand it.

622
00:49:21.585 --> 00:49:24.629
There must be at least one
who'd make a suitable mother.

623
00:49:24.713 --> 00:49:26.590
Sire.

624
00:49:26.673 --> 00:49:29.134
A suitable wife.

625
00:49:48.236 --> 00:49:53.783
Mademoiselles
Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine.

626
00:49:53.867 --> 00:49:56.536
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.

627
00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:06.338
I give up.
Even I couldn't expect the boy to...

628
00:50:06.421 --> 00:50:09.966
Well, if I may say so,
Your Majesty, I did try to warn you,

629
00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:13.887
but you, Sire, are incurably romantic.

630
00:50:14.346 --> 00:50:18.934
No doubt you saw
the whole pretty picture in detail.

631
00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:23.355
The young Prince
bowing to the assembly.

632
00:50:24.147 --> 00:50:27.234
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.

633
00:50:27.317 --> 00:50:30.862
For, lo, there she stands.

634
00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:33.240
The girl of his dreams.

635
00:50:34.991 --> 00:50:36.910
Who she is or whence she came,

636
00:50:37.494 --> 00:50:39.829
he knows not, nor does he care,

637
00:50:39.913 --> 00:50:42.707
for his heart tells him that here,

638
00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:47.837
here is the maid
predestined to be his bride.

639
00:50:49.673 --> 00:50:52.342
A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire.

640
00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:54.553
But in real life, oh, no.

641
00:50:54.636 --> 00:50:57.931
No! It was foredoomed to failure.

642
00:50:58.265 --> 00:51:00.809
Failure, en?

643
00:51:00.892 --> 00:51:04.062
Take a look at that,
you pompous windbag.

644
00:51:05.355 --> 00:51:06.690
Who is she?

645
00:51:06.773 --> 00:51:08.858
- You know her?
- No, Sire.

646
00:51:08.942 --> 00:51:11.027
I've never seen her before.

647
00:51:11.111 --> 00:51:13.405
That's one thing in her favour.

648
00:51:13.488 --> 00:51:15.448
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!

649
00:51:19.244 --> 00:51:22.330
Lights. The lights.

650
00:51:41.308 --> 00:51:43.727
Failure, en?

651
00:51:47.606 --> 00:51:51.067
Well... Now for a good night's sleep.

652
00:51:51.151 --> 00:51:53.862
Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too...

653
00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:56.698
You will stay right here.

654
00:51:56.781 --> 00:52:00.410
See they're not disturbed,
and when the boy proposes,

655
00:52:00.493 --> 00:52:03.580
notify me immediately.

656
00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:05.123
Notify me immediately.

657
00:52:05.206 --> 00:52:06.916
And remember,

658
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.502
if anything goes wrong...

659
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.396
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?

660
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.940
Well, the Prince certainly seems to.

661
00:52:31.024 --> 00:52:33.109
I know I've never seen her.

662
00:52:33.193 --> 00:52:34.527
Nor I.

663
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:37.614
But she certainly is... Wait.

664
00:52:38.365 --> 00:52:40.950
There is something familiar about her.

665
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:06.476
So this is love.

666
00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:10.980
So this is love.

667
00:53:11.064 --> 00:53:14.984
So this is what makes life.

668
00:53:15.068 --> 00:53:18.196
Divine

669
00:53:18.279 --> 00:53:21.783
I'm all aglow.

670
00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:26.204
- And now I know.
- And now I know.

671
00:53:26.287 --> 00:53:30.792
The key to all Heaven.

672
00:53:30.875 --> 00:53:34.337
Is mine.

673
00:53:34.421 --> 00:53:38.425
My heart has wings.

674
00:53:38.508 --> 00:53:42.512
And I can fly

675
00:53:42.595 --> 00:53:46.433
I'll touch every star.

676
00:53:46.516 --> 00:53:49.769
In the sky.

677
00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:55.900
So this is the miracle.

678
00:53:55.984 --> 00:54:01.781
That I've been dreaming of.

679
00:54:10.832 --> 00:54:13.251
So this.

680
00:54:13.334 --> 00:54:15.962
Is.

681
00:54:16.045 --> 00:54:19.466
Love.

682
00:54:22.886 --> 00:54:24.471
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

683
00:54:24.554 --> 00:54:26.306
What's the matter?

684
00:54:26.389 --> 00:54:27.640
It's midnight.

685
00:54:27.724 --> 00:54:29.726
Yes, so it is. But why...

686
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:32.103
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.

687
00:54:32.187 --> 00:54:34.898
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.

688
00:54:34.981 --> 00:54:36.608
- Please, I must.
- But why?

689
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:38.943
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,

690
00:54:39.027 --> 00:54:40.487
I haven't met the Prince.

691
00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:41.905
The Prince?

692
00:54:41.988 --> 00:54:43.114
But didn't you know...

693
00:54:44.407 --> 00:54:46.576
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.

694
00:54:46.659 --> 00:54:48.953
Come back. Please come back.

695
00:54:49.287 --> 00:54:51.873
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?

696
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:53.500
Wait! Please wait.

697
00:54:54.626 --> 00:54:55.960
Goodbye.

698
00:54:56.544 --> 00:54:58.797
Oh, I say. Young lady.

699
00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.091
- Wait!
- The Prince!

700
00:55:11.768 --> 00:55:12.852
Just a moment.

701
00:55:13.895 --> 00:55:16.606
Guard! Guard!

702
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:21.194
Stop that coach! Close those gates!

703
00:55:24.197 --> 00:55:26.115
Follow that coach!

704
00:55:26.199 --> 00:55:28.576
Open those gates!

705
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.739
I'm sorry.

706
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.743
I guess I forgot about everything.

707
00:56:11.703 --> 00:56:13.496
Even the time, but...

708
00:56:14.956 --> 00:56:17.709
But it was so wonderful.

709
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:20.670
And he was so handsome,

710
00:56:20.753 --> 00:56:23.172
and when we danced...

711
00:56:23.256 --> 00:56:26.885
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince
himself couldn't have been more...

712
00:56:26.968 --> 00:56:28.177
More...

713
00:56:29.345 --> 00:56:32.015
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.

714
00:56:32.098 --> 00:56:34.100
Look, look! The slippers!

715
00:56:34.225 --> 00:56:35.310
Yeah, your slipper.

716
00:56:35.393 --> 00:56:37.604
Your slipper, Cinderelly.

717
00:56:41.733 --> 00:56:43.067
Thank you.

718
00:56:43.776 --> 00:56:46.696
Thank you so much, for everything.

719
00:56:56.539 --> 00:57:00.919
Your Majesty,
I see no point in beating about the bush.

720
00:57:01.002 --> 00:57:02.962
I regret to inform you, Sire,

721
00:57:03.046 --> 00:57:05.214
that the young lady has disappeared,

722
00:57:05.298 --> 00:57:08.092
leaving behind only this glass slipper.

723
00:57:08.176 --> 00:57:09.969
Yes. I'll do it.

724
00:57:12.138 --> 00:57:15.308
No. I just can't.

725
00:57:43.962 --> 00:57:45.630
Well, come in.

726
00:57:46.172 --> 00:57:47.757
Come in!

727
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.052
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?

728
00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:52.595
- Tell me about it.
- Well...

729
00:57:52.679 --> 00:57:55.098
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...

730
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:57.809
No matter. We've more
important things to discuss.

731
00:57:57.892 --> 00:57:59.560
Arrangements for the wedding,

732
00:57:59.644 --> 00:58:02.271
invitations, a national holiday.

733
00:58:02.981 --> 00:58:05.233
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...

734
00:58:05.316 --> 00:58:07.986
Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more.

735
00:58:08.528 --> 00:58:09.570
But...

736
00:58:09.654 --> 00:58:12.448
Better practise passing these out, eh?

737
00:58:12.532 --> 00:58:15.785
But, if you'd only listen.

738
00:58:15.868 --> 00:58:17.620
And for you, my friend.

739
00:58:17.704 --> 00:58:21.457
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.

740
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:24.043
I hereby dub you Sir...

741
00:58:25.336 --> 00:58:27.922
By the way, what title would you like?

742
00:58:28.423 --> 00:58:31.467
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?

743
00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:33.720
A peculiar title, but if that's what you...

744
00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:37.390
She what? Why, you...

745
00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:39.642
You... You traitor!

746
00:58:39.726 --> 00:58:42.645
Now, Sire.
Remember, your blood pressure.

747
00:58:42.729 --> 00:58:44.605
Treason!

748
00:58:47.442 --> 00:58:48.985
No, Sire. No!

749
00:58:49.068 --> 00:58:51.446
Sabotage!

750
00:58:52.405 --> 00:58:54.323
You were in league with the Prince.

751
00:58:54.407 --> 00:58:56.451
I tried to stop her,

752
00:58:56.534 --> 00:58:58.411
but she vanished into thin air.

753
00:58:58.494 --> 00:59:00.246
A likely story.

754
00:59:00.329 --> 00:59:03.666
But it's true, Sire.
All we could find was this glass slipper.

755
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:06.252
The whole thing was a plot!

756
00:59:07.086 --> 00:59:09.839
But, Sire, he loves her.

757
00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:11.841
He won't rest till he finds her.

758
00:59:11.924 --> 00:59:13.843
He's determined to marry her.

759
00:59:15.219 --> 00:59:18.181
What? What did you say?

760
00:59:18.556 --> 00:59:21.142
The Prince, Sire,
swears he'll marry none

761
00:59:21.225 --> 00:59:23.352
but the girl who fits this slipper.

762
00:59:23.436 --> 00:59:25.229
He said that, did he?

763
00:59:26.272 --> 00:59:28.858
We've got him!

764
00:59:33.946 --> 00:59:37.366
But, Sire, this slipper
may fit one of any number of girls.

765
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.328
That's his problem. He's given his word.

766
00:59:40.411 --> 00:59:43.539
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.

767
00:59:43.623 --> 00:59:45.625
I'll have nothing to do with it.

768
00:59:45.708 --> 00:59:48.419
You'll try this
on every maid in my kingdom.

769
00:59:48.503 --> 00:59:49.754
And if the shoe fits,

770
00:59:51.339 --> 00:59:53.216
bring her in.

771
00:59:53.299 --> 00:59:56.094
Yes, Your Majesty.

772
01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:12.193
Cinderella? Cinderella?

773
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:15.363
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?

774
01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:16.781
Here I am.

775
01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:18.741
My daughters, where are they?

776
01:00:18.825 --> 01:00:20.326
I think they're still in bed.

777
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:25.832
Don't just stand there!
Bring up the breakfast trays at once.

778
01:00:25.915 --> 01:00:27.125
And hurry!

779
01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:30.336
Wow. I wonder what's the matter.

780
01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:32.130
What's the matter with her?

781
01:00:32.213 --> 01:00:34.423
I don't know. Let's find out. Come on.

782
01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.433
Drizella. Drizella!

783
01:00:44.517 --> 01:00:46.644
What?

784
01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:48.688
Get up. Quick. This instant.

785
01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:50.648
We haven't a moment to lose.

786
01:00:51.858 --> 01:00:53.693
Anastasia.

787
01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:54.986
Anastasia.

788
01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:58.990
Get up, Anastasia.

789
01:01:00.116 --> 01:01:02.326
What for? Why?

790
01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:05.246
Everyone's talking about it,
the whole kingdom.

791
01:01:05.538 --> 01:01:07.832
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?

792
01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:10.960
The Grand Duke.
He's been hunting all night.

793
01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:13.129
- Hunting?
- For that girl.

794
01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.756
The one who lost
her slipper at the ball last night.

795
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.800
They say he's madly in love with her.

796
01:01:17.884 --> 01:01:21.512
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!

797
01:01:21.596 --> 01:01:23.848
The Prince!

798
01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.768
You clumsy little fool.

799
01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:31.147
Clean that up,
then help my daughters dress.

800
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:32.481
What for?

801
01:01:32.565 --> 01:01:34.650
If he's in love with that girl,

802
01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:36.485
why should we even bother?

803
01:01:36.569 --> 01:01:39.363
Now, you two, listen to me.

804
01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:42.491
There is still a chance
that one of you can get it.

805
01:01:42.575 --> 01:01:45.912
One of us?
Why, Mother, what do you mean?

806
01:01:45.995 --> 01:01:47.663
Just this:

807
01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:51.334
No one, not even the Prince,
knows who that girl is.

808
01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:54.170
We know! We know! Cinderelly!

809
01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:56.797
The glass slipper is their only clue.

810
01:01:56.881 --> 01:01:59.383
The Duke has been ordered to try it on

811
01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:00.843
every girl in the kingdom.

812
01:02:00.927 --> 01:02:04.055
And if one can be found
whom the slipper fits,

813
01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:06.515
then, by the King's command,

814
01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:09.101
that girl shall be the Prince's bride.

815
01:02:09.185 --> 01:02:12.021
- His bride.
- His bride!

816
01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:14.440
Cinderella, get my things together.

817
01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:16.442
Never mind her. Get mine right away.

818
01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:26.369
What's the matter with her?

819
01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:29.914
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.

820
01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:33.376
Dressed. Oh, yes.

821
01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:35.127
Oh, we must get dressed.

822
01:02:35.211 --> 01:02:37.505
It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me...

823
01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:39.257
Mother, did you see what she did?

824
01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.801
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!

825
01:02:43.552 --> 01:02:46.555
So this is love.

826
01:02:59.986 --> 01:03:01.445
What's she gonna do?

827
01:03:01.529 --> 01:03:03.155
I don't know. Gotta watch.

828
01:03:03.239 --> 01:03:04.490
Come on.

829
01:03:29.307 --> 01:03:31.017
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!

830
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.186
So this is the miracle.

831
01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:36.355
That I've been dreaming of.

832
01:03:40.735 --> 01:03:42.361
What?

833
01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:45.448
Oh, no!

834
01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:47.491
No, please!

835
01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:50.161
Oh, you can't, you just can't.

836
01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:53.122
Let me out! You must let me out!

837
01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:56.208
You can't keep me in here!

838
01:03:56.292 --> 01:03:59.128
Oh, please.

839
01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:02.340
No, no. She can't do it.
She can't lock up Cinderelly.

840
01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:03.841
I'm gonna...

841
01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:06.135
Please. Please.

842
01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:09.847
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.

843
01:04:21.776 --> 01:04:23.986
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.

844
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:27.114
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.

845
01:04:27.198 --> 01:04:28.366
We gotta get that key quick.

846
01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:30.368
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.

847
01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:35.581
Oh, Mother, Mother,
he's here, he's here.

848
01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.708
- The Grand Duke.
- Do I look all right?

849
01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:40.920
- I'm so excited, I don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.

850
01:04:41.003 --> 01:04:44.423
Now, remember,
this is your last chance. Don't fail me.

851
01:04:49.345 --> 01:04:53.015
Announcing
His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke.

852
01:04:53.099 --> 01:04:55.893
You honour our humble home.

853
01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.019
Quite so.

854
01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.855
May I present my daughters,

855
01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:02.733
Drizella, Anastasia.

856
01:05:02.817 --> 01:05:04.193
Your Grace.

857
01:05:06.112 --> 01:05:07.988
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.

858
01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:11.450
His Grace will read
the royal proclamation.

859
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.997
"All loyal subjects
of His Imperial Majesty

860
01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:20.376
"are hereby notified by royal
proclamation in regard to a certain

861
01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:23.921
"glass slipper.

862
01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:26.090
"It is decreed..."

863
01:05:26.173 --> 01:05:29.093
Why, that's my slipper!

864
01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:32.346
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!

865
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.724
No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper!

866
01:05:35.808 --> 01:05:38.727
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.

867
01:05:38.811 --> 01:05:40.312
Your manners.

868
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:43.899
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.

869
01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.526
Please continue.

870
01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:46.944
Yes, quite so.

871
01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:50.698
Oh, yes.
"It is upon this day decreed

872
01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:53.993
"that a quest be instituted throughout...

873
01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:57.830
"The sole and express

"That every maid throughout the

875
01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:05.588

"and should one be found upon whose

"such maiden shall be

878

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.050
"So be it."

889
01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:56.138
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.

890
01:06:56.222 --> 01:06:58.641
May we offer you some tea?

891
01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:01.310
What? Tea?

892
01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:03.687
Thank you, madam, no.

893
01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:06.357
We must proceed with the fitting.

894
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.817
Of course. Anastasia, dear.

895
01:07:13.072 --> 01:07:15.866
There. I knew it was my slipper.

896
01:07:16.492 --> 01:07:17.993
Exactly my size.

897
01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:19.912
I always wear the same size.

898
01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:21.872
As soon as I saw it, I said...

899
01:07:21.956 --> 01:07:23.832
Oh, well...

900
01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:26.669
It may be a trifle snug today.

901
01:07:26.752 --> 01:07:29.338
You know how it is, dancing all night.

902
01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:31.298
I can't understand why.

903
01:07:31.382 --> 01:07:33.425
It's always fit perfectly before.

904
01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:35.719
I don't think you're half trying.

905
01:07:36.512 --> 01:07:38.847
Mother, can you...

906
01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:42.226
Quiet, my dear.
We mustn't disturb His Grace.

907
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:45.854
Young man, are you sure
you're trying it on the right foot?

908
01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:51.360
On, it's the right foot, but...

909
01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:53.195
These glass shoes
aren't always reliable.

910
01:07:53.279 --> 01:07:55.197
Come on, hurry.

911
01:07:55.281 --> 01:07:57.157
Up the stairs, up the stairs!

912
01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:00.995
Lucify, Lucify.

913
01:08:04.373 --> 01:08:06.792
Up, up, up with it.

914
01:08:16.802 --> 01:08:17.970
Here.

915
01:08:33.986 --> 01:08:35.904
Why can't you hold still a minute?

916
01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:39.033
My word. Enough of this!

917
01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:43.746
The next young lady, please.

918
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:45.456
Did you hear that, Gus?

919
01:08:45.539 --> 01:08:47.583
- “Yup.
- Gotta hurry.

920
01:08:53.339 --> 01:08:55.341
Come on, come on, hurry.

921
01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:05.851
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.

922
01:09:05.934 --> 01:09:08.771
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.

923
01:09:17.655 --> 01:09:19.823
Us is coming, Cinderelly.

924
01:09:19.907 --> 01:09:22.493
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!

925
01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:25.496
How did you ever manage to...

926
01:09:25.579 --> 01:09:27.164
Lucifer!

927
01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:29.541
Let him go, Lucifer.

928
01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:32.169
Please, let him go.

929
01:09:32.795 --> 01:09:34.755
- Let him go.
- Let him go!

930
01:09:34.838 --> 01:09:37.299
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?

931
01:09:37.383 --> 01:09:39.134
Lucify, you...

932
01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:20.592
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!

933
01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:23.804
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!

934
01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:47.286
Of all the stupid little idiots.

935
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.955
I'll do it myself.

936
01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:51.749
Get away from me.

937
01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:54.877
I'll make it fit.

938
01:10:55.461 --> 01:10:57.296
- There.
- It fits.

939
01:10:57.379 --> 01:10:58.630
It fits?

940
01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:02.843
No!

941
01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:11.602
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

942
01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:13.520
It shan't happen again.

943
01:11:13.604 --> 01:11:15.063
Precisely, madam.

944
01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:44.343
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.

945
01:11:44.885 --> 01:11:46.845
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

946
01:11:47.513 --> 01:11:49.473
Let go, let go.

947
01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:57.189
You are the only ladies
in the household I hope... I presume.

948
01:11:57.272 --> 01:11:59.983
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.

949
01:12:00.067 --> 01:12:02.653
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?

950
01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:05.781
Your Grace, please, wait.

951
01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:07.991
May I try it on?

952
01:12:08.075 --> 01:12:10.911
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.

953
01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:12.871
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.

954
01:12:12.955 --> 01:12:14.998
She's out of her mind.

955
01:12:15.082 --> 01:12:17.000
Just an imaginative child.

956
01:12:17.084 --> 01:12:20.087
Madam,
my orders were "every maiden."

957
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:23.173
Come, my child.

958
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.107
Oh, no.

959
01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.651
No, no, no. Oh, no!

960
01:12:42.734 --> 01:12:44.778
Oh, this is terrible.

961
01:12:44.862 --> 01:12:47.072
The King, what will he say?

962
01:12:47.865 --> 01:12:49.324
What will he do?

963
01:12:49.408 --> 01:12:50.951
Perhaps, if it would help...

964
01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:54.454
No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing.

965
01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.540
But, you see, I have the other slipper.

966
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:37.623
Have faith in dreams.

967
01:13:37.706 --> 01:13:40.417
And someday.

968
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:46.048
Your rainbow
will come smiling through.

969
01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:50.928
No matter how your heart is grieving.

970
01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:55.182
If you keep on believing.

971
01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:58.518
The dream that you wish.

972
01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:02.606
Will come true
