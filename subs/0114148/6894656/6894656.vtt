I've got a crew assembled,
and they're ready to go.

349
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.520
About the natives...

350
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.160
I'm counting on you
to make sure those
filthy heathens

351
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.720
don't disrupt
our mission.

352
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.680
Well, if they're anything
like the savages
I've fought before,

353
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.320
it's nothing
I can't handle.

354
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.440
Right.
That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

355
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.840
See ya, Percy.
[growling]

356
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.840
The men like Smith,
don't they?

357
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880
[growling]

358
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.360
I've never been
a popular man.
I like you.

359
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.360
Don't think I don't know
what those backstabbers
at court say about me.

360
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.880
Oh, yes, all that talk
about being a pathetic
social climber

361
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.040
who's failed
at everything...

362
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.640
I'm very well aware
that this is

363
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.240
my last chance for glory.
But mark my words, Wiggins,

364
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.920
when King James sees the gold
these peasants unearth,

365
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.720
success will be mine,
at last.

366
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.880
[man] Wake up! Shake a leg!
Two of you up
on the yardarm!

367
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.640
It's incredible.

368
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.240
And it's all ours.
I've never seen
anything like it.

369
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.480
It can look like
Ratcliffe's knickers
for all I care,

370
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.440
just as long as
I get off this
stinking boat!

371
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.800
Come on, men.
We didn't come all this
way just to look at it.

372
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.720
[men call]
[birds chirp]

373
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.520
[wilderness sounds]

374
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.920
[man] Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut! Steady!
Steady!

375
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.800
[man 2] Hold up!
That's far enough!

376
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.440
All right now...
tie her off!

377
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.320
Here, John,
tie off this end.

378
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.720
John? John?

379
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.480
What are you
doing up there?

380
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.920
Getting a better look.

381
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.360
[squeaking]

382
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.920

384
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.640
Hey!

[cooing]

388
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.840
Well... you're
a strange looking fellow.

389
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.600
You hungry?

390
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.920
Here you go.
It's a biscuit.

391
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.680
It's food.
Well, sort of.

392
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.520
You like it, eh?
[purring]

393
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.440
Well, try eating it
for four months straight.

394
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.960
[chittering]
You got a friend
back there?

395
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.000
[angry squeaking]
Hey... what the...
What...? Watch out.

396
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.440
No... get that...
Look out!
[purring, chirping]

397
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.720
[trumpet sounds]
John, you better
get down here!

398
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.560
The governor's
coming ashore.

399
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.640
[angry squeaking]
All right. I'm leaving.

400
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.600
[chirping]

401
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.560
[murmuring]

402
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.880
[man] Did you see
their skin?

403
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.960
[man 2]
Pale and sickly.

404
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.560
They have hair
on their faces
like dogs.

405
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.880
My brothers, we must know
more about these visitors.

406
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.880
Kekata, what do you see?

407
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.080
[chanting]

408
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.440
[speaking Algonquian]

409
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.440
[rattling, howling]

410
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.600
These are not
men like us...

411
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.640
...but strange beasts
with bodies that shine
like the sun,

412
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.800
and weapons that
spout fire and thunder.

413
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.600
They prowl the earth
like ravenous wolves,

414
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.880
consuming everything
in their path.

415
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.480
Great Powhatan, I will lead
our warriors to the river
and attack.

416
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.480
We will destroy
these invaders the way we
destroyed the Massawomecks.

417
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.880
Kocoum, in that battle
we knew how to fight
our enemy,

418
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.560
but these pale visitors
are strange to us.

419
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.960
Take some men
to the river
to observe them.

420
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.760
Let us hope
they do not
intend to stay.

421
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.880
[military drumroll]

422
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.720
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches

423
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.120
in the name of His Majesty,
King James the First,

424
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.680
and do so name this
settlement Jamestown.

425
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.840
[men cheer]
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir!

426
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.160
Hurry now, Percy.

427
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.000
We must be all
squeaky clean
for the New World.

428
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.000
[sighing]

429
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
[gulping]

430
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.240
[purring]

431
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.000
[growling]

432
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.640
[purring]

433
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.960
[snarling]

434
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.840
[yelping]

435

[yipping]

440
00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.840
[growling, moaning]

441
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.880
Captain Smith,
it appears I've selected
the perfect location.

442
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.200
Not a savage in sight.

443
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.040
Just because we don't
see them doesn't mean
they're not out there.

444
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.240
Then perhaps you should
venture forth and determine
their whereabouts, hm?

445
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.880
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

446
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.720
Now, gentlemen, to work.

447
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.640
You men,
get the ship unloaded,
you men build the fort.

448
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.680
The rest of you...
break out the shovels!

449
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.600
It's time to
start digging!
Digging?

450
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.920
Well, of course!
Let's not forget
what the Spanish found

451
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.080
when they came
to the New World.

452
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.080
Gold! Mountains of it.

453
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.880
Why, for years,
they've been ravaging
the New World

454
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.880
of its most
precious resources.

455
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.800
But now...

456
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.240

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.240
The warriors are here.

855
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.160
[chattering]

856
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.600
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing
with one of them?

857
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.360
There you are!
Kocoum!

858
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.320
Look at them! Now we have
enough warriors to destroy
those white demons!

859
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.560
Now that we are
joined by our brothers,
we will defeat this enemy.

860
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.080
Father, I need to
speak with you.

861
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.680
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.

862
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.280
We don't have to fight them.
There must be a better way.

863
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.120
Sometimes our paths
are chosen for us.

864
00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.680
But maybe we should try
talking to them.

865
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.440
They do not
want to talk.

866
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.440
But if one of them
did want to talk,

867
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.240
you would listen to him,
wouldn't you?

868
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.320
Pocahontas...
Wouldn't you?

869
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.560
Of course I would,
but it is not that simple.

870
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.240
Nothing is
simple anymore.

871
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.680
[twigs snap]

872
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.320
[whimpering]

873
00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.440
[barking]

874
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.240
[growling]
[chittering]

875
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.160
[barking, growling]

876
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.480
[purring]

877
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.520
[howling]

878
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.280
[coyote howls]

879
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.360
[gasping]

880
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.320
Easy, Thomas, it's me.

881
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.920
Oh, John!
I could've killed you.

882
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.880
Not aiming like that,
you couldn't.

883
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.960
Keep both eyes open
when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.

884
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.280
Smith! There you are.

885
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.920
We were looking
all over for you.

886
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.400
Smith! Where have you been?

887
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.920
I was out scouting
the terrain, sir.

888
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.560
Excellent.
Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

889
00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.640
We'll need that
information for
the battle.

890
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.160
What battle?
We will eliminate
these savages

891
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.560
once and for all.

892
00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.840
No! You can't do that!

893
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.880
Oh, can't I?

894
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.560
Look. We don't
have to fight them.

895
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.600
John, what's
gotten into you?
I met one of them.

896
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.880
You what?
A savage?

897
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.760
They're not savages.
They can help us.

898
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:21.800
They know the land.
They know how to
navigate the rivers.

899
00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.560
And look. It's food.
What is it?

900
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.800
It's better than hardtack
and gruel, that's for sure.

901
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.920
I like gruel.

902
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.720
They don't want to feed us,
you ninnies!

903
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.240
They want to kill us!
All of us!

904
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.400
They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything
to keep it!

905
00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.400
But there is no gold.

906
00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.720
No gold?

907
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.280
And I suppose your
little Indian friend
told you this?

908
00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.680
Yes.

909
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.480
Lies. Lies! All of it!
Murderous thieves.

910
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.640
There's no room
for their kind in
civilized society.

911
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.240
But this is their land!

912
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.560
This is my land!
I make the laws here.

913
00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.840
And I say anyone
who so much as
looks at an Indian

914
00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:06.360
without killing him
on sight will be tried
for treason and hanged.

915
00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.280
[coyotes howl]
[panting]

916
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.720
[Nakoma] Pocahontas!

917
00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.600
Nakoma.
Don't go out there.

918
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.920
I lied for you once,
don't ask me to do it again.

919
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.600
I have to do this.

920
00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.760
He's one of them!
You don't know him.

921
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.720
If you go out there,
you'll be turning your
back on your own people.

922
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.320
I'm trying to
help my people.

923
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.520
Pocahontas, please,
you're my best friend.

924
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.360
I don't want you
to get hurt.

925
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.560
I won't.
I know what I'm doing.

926
00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.320
Pocahontas, no!

927
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.760
[Ben] Ratcliffe wouldn't
take us halfway around
the world for nothing.

928
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.320
[man] But what if Smith
is right? What if there
is no gold?

929
00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.560
If you ask me,
Ratcliffe's been lying
to us since we left London.

930
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.560
Listen to you,
you bunch of idiots.

931
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.960
Those savages didn't
attack us for nothing.

932
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.760
They're
hiding something.

933
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.360
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have
to fight them.

934
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.880
Not me. I'm not
risking my neck...
Either too hot or too cold.

935
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.560
I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.

936
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.120
[man] Me, too.
I'm itching a lot.

937
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.080
[gasping]

938
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.720
Follow him.
Yes, Governor.

939
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.320
I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.

940
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.360
Yes, sir.
If you happen to
see any Indians...

941
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.800
...shoot them.

942
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.360
Oh, and, Thomas,
you've been
a slipshod sailor

943
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.800
and a poor excuse
for a soldier.

944
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.080
Don't disappoint me again.

945
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.320
Kocoum.
What is it?

946
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.720
It's Pocahontas.

947
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.080
What's wrong?
Is she all right?

948
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.080
I think she's in trouble.

949
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.840
The earth is
trembling, child.
What's happened?

950
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.400
The warriors are here.

951
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.600
Pocahontas.
John!

952
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:17.520
Listen to me.
My men are planning
to attack your people.

953
00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.640
You've got to warn them.

954
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.880
Maybe it's not too late
to stop this.

955
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.040
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

956
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.800
Pocahontas, talking
isn't going to do any good.

957
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.680
I already tried
talking to my men,

958
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.760
but everything
about this land
has them spooked.

959
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.520
[howling, moaning]

960
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.920
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen!

961
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.080
[yowling, whining]

962
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.640
Percy?

963
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.960
[chittering]
[snarling, barking]

964
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.480
Easy, Percy! Come here!

965
00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.760
Meeko, come back!

966
00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.640
You see what I mean?
Once two sides want to fight,
nothing can stop them.

967
00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.960
Come here, both of you!
It's all right.
He's a friend.

968
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.400
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!
[barking]

969
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.600
[squeaking]

970
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.040
[Pocahontas]
What are you doing?
Meeko!

971
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.600
[John]
Percy, get back here!

972
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.280
What are you doing?
Stop that!

973
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.120
All right,
that's enough!

974
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.760
[whimpering]

975
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.120
[whining]

976
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.800
It's enough to make
your sap boil.

977
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.600
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look!

978
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.920
The ripples.
What about them?

979
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.600
So small at first,
then look how they grow.

980
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.600
But someone
has to start them.

981
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.840
They're not going
to listen to us.

982
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.160
Young man, sometimes
the right path is not
the easiest one.

983
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.000
Don't you see?

984
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.520
Only when the fighting stops
can you be together.

985
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.000
All right.
Let's go talk
to your father.

986
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.080
[purring]

987
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.840
[squeaking]

988
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.840

[grunting]

991
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.720
Kocoum, no!

992
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.160
[straining]

993
00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.240
Kocoum!

994
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.720
Leave him alone!

995
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.720
[grunting, gasping]

996
00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.720
[straining, grunting]

997
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.760
Kocoum, stop!

998
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.600
Both eyes open.

999
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.960
[blasting]
[groaning]

1000
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.200
[gasping]

1001
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.160
Thomas!
Is he...

1002
00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.120
You killed him.

1003
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.120
I thought that...
Get away from him!

1004
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.280
Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...

1005
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.360
He killed him!

1006
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.920
[man]
Get all the wagons...

1007
00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.600
Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!

1008
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.120
[war whooping]
[whimpering]

1009
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.280

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.720
[crowd gasps, weeps]

1014
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.800
Who did this?

1015
01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.880
Pocahontas was out
in the woods.

1016
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.880
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man
attacked them.

1017
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.840
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger
is stronger.

1018
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.520
At sunrise,
he'll be the first to die!

1019
01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.920
But, Father!

1020
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.960
I told you to stay
in the village.

1021
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.960
You disobeyed me.

1022
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.920
You have shamed
your father!

1023
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.800
I was only
trying to help.

1024
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.880
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

1025
01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.760
Take him away!

1026
01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.440
Kocoum was just coming
to protect me.

1027
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.440
Pocahontas...
I sent Kocoum after you.

1028
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.720
I was worried about you.

1029
01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.960
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

1030
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.960
All this happened
because of me.

1031
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.080
And now I'll never see
John Smith again.

1032
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.720
Come with me.

1033
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.240
[tribal drums, chanting]

1034
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.760
Pocahontas wants to look
into the eyes of the man
who killed Kocoum.

1035
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.960
Be quick.

1036
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.040
Pocahontas.

1037
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.600
I'm so sorry.

1038
01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.080
For what? This?

1039
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.440
I've gotten out of
worse scrapes than this.

1040
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.160
Can't think of any
right now, but...

1041
01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.360
It would've been better
if we'd never met.

1042
01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.440
None of this
would've happened.

1043
01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.440
Pocahontas, look at me.

1044
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:44.320
I'd rather die tomorrow
than live a hundred years
without knowing you.

1045
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.480
Pocahontas.

1046
01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.480
I can't leave you.

1047
01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.160
You never will.

1048
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.000
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you.
Forever.

1049
01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.320
[Thomas] Help!
Somebody help! Help!

1050
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.160
Help!
Easy, lad. What is it?

1051
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.880
It's Smith!
They got him!

1052
01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.520
Who got him?
The savages!

1053
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.040
Savages?
They captured him!
Dragged him off!

1054
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.880
Where'd they take him?
They headed north.

1055
01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.000
[man]
How many were there?

1056
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.120
[Thomas] I don't know.
At least a dozen.

1057
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.320
[Ben] Filthy beasts!

1058
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.280
It's perfect, Wiggins!
I couldn't have planned
this better myself.

1059
01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.320
The gold is
as good as mine.

1060
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.200
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same
for any of us.

1061
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.560
Thomas is right!
We've got to do something.

1062
01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.440
And so we shall.
I told you those savages
couldn't be trusted.

1063
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.200
Smith tried to
befriend them,

1064
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.880
and look what
they've done to him!

1065
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.920
But now I say
it's time to rescue
our courageous comrade.

1066

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.840
Going back is
his only chance.

1192
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.280
He'll die
if he stays here.

1193
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.680
Here.

1194
01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.120
It's from
Grandmother Willow's bark.

1195
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.120
It'll help with the pain.

1196
01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.560
What pain? I've had
worse pain than this.

1197
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.080
Can't think of
any right now, but...

1198
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.880
You are always welcome
among our people.

1199
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.920
Thank you, my brother.

1200
01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.040
I thought you
didn't like strangers.
[chirps]

1201
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.240
My mother's necklace.

1202
01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.600
[whimpering]
See ya, Percy.

1203
01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.840
[sneezing]

1204
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.240
Come with me?

1205
01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.200
You must choose
your own path.

1206
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.760
I'm needed here.

1207
01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.840
Then... I'll stay with you.

1208
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.880
No. You have to go back.

1209
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.280
But I can't leave you.

1210
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.760
You never will.

1211
01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.000
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you...

1212
01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.440
...forever.

1213
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.000
Good luck, lad.
Godspeed, John.

1214
01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.840
[man] The crew a-ready?
[man 2] Aye, sir!

1215
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.840
Set the mainsails.

1216
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.440
[man] Weigh anchor!

1217
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.520
[man 2] Let go
of the topgallants!

1218
01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.200
[panting]

1219
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.480
[wind singing]
