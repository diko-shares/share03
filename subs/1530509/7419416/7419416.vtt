Could you just calm down?

3
00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:15.052
- He did not know
I took the car.

4
00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:16.777
He will be
absolutely fucking furious.

5
00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.180
- Your dad
doesn't have to find out.

6
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:19.580
We can come back
and get it tomorrow

7
00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:20.937

8

that car, mate.

11
00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:47.982
So get out of my face.

12
00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:58.741
What are you fucking looking at?

13
00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:01.978
Stop looking at
my girlfriend, midget!

14
00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.541

15
00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:04.697
- You want to fucky-fucky her?

16
00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:06.293
No way in hell,
'cause let me tell you,

17
00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:07.697

Don't!

25
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.654
Ian!

26
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:13.635
- Hey, I hope you're not
time wasting, you.

27
00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:16.235
I've got a dozen people
waiting to look at this place,

28
00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:18.115
most of them paying cash

29
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.235
You got cash?

30
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.395
Right, the light switch is
somewhere here I think.

31
00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:51.632
- Hey, come on, let's get
this fucking lease signed, hey?

You swine.

46
00:13:29.673 --> 00:13:31.593
I've called Dr. Sebring,

Get up!

48
00:15:38.264 --> 00:15:40.151
Hello, Martin.

49
00:16:33.341 --> 00:16:34.464
Mmm.

50
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.063
Martin...

51
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.583
come and join us.

52
00:17:17.297 --> 00:17:20.821
Well..

53
00:17:20.977 --> 00:17:24.424
Martin, I have your Ventolin.

54
00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:35.700
Martin, I'm here today

55
00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.617
because your mother is
very worried about you.

56
00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:40.980
- He keeps on talking
about a centipede

57
00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:42.935
with 12 people.

58
00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:46.423
What does that mean?

59
00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.096
- Now, let's see.

60
00:17:56.135 --> 00:17:59.255
A centipede can be considered
a phallic symbol.

61
00:17:59.414 --> 00:18:01.738
Centipedes are
very aggressive creatures.

62
00:18:01.894 --> 00:18:04.502
Their bite can be very painful.

63
00:18:04.654 --> 00:18:09.575
Maybe he is connecting the pain
that a centipede inflicts

64
00:18:09.734 --> 00:18:11.261
with the pain inflicted on him

65
00:18:11.414 --> 00:18:15.942
through years of psychological
and sexual abuse by his father.

66
00:18:18.413 --> 00:18:20.574
- I miss my husband.

67
00:18:25.612 --> 00:18:30.937
And it's your fault
that he's in prison!

68
00:18:31.092 --> 00:18:35.097
- Sometimes people
that are mentally challenged

69
00:18:35.252 --> 00:18:42.333
and have a history
of sexual abuse...

70
00:18:42.491 --> 00:18:46.016
mutilate
their own sexual organs.

71
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.098
I'm sorry.
I going to have to go.

72
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.411
There's nothing to worry about.

73
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.818
I'm sure it's just
a passing phase.

74
00:19:03.969 --> 00:19:05.694
Hmm?

75
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.050
Martin.

76
00:19:12.209 --> 00:19:16.137
Ah.
You're a good boy.

77
00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.176
Mrs. Lomax.

78
00:19:37.928 --> 00:19:42.095
- I've decided to kill us both.

79
00:19:48.966 --> 00:19:52.251
This music is driving me crazy!

80
00:19:55.886 --> 00:19:57.850
I can't stand this any more!

81
00:20:28.924 --> 00:20:31.531
He can't stand it any more!

82
00:20:33.923 --> 00:20:35.767
Come on, tell him.

83
00:20:36.323 --> 00:20:40.852
Be a man like your father.

84
00:20:41.003 --> 00:20:43.731
- Stop fucking bothering me,
you retard.

85
00:20:43.883 --> 00:20:47.407
I play my fucking music
as loud as I fucking want, okay?

86
00:20:47.563 --> 00:20:49.843
- Kill us both.
I'm begging you.

87
00:20:50.002 --> 00:20:52.883
- Shut your fucking mouth,
you old cunt.

88
00:20:53.042 --> 00:20:56.370
What the fuck?

89
00:20:59.602 --> 00:21:01.326
- I will play my music
so fucking loud,

90
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:02.965
it's going to make
your fucking ears bleed,

91
00:21:03.121 --> 00:21:04.125
you cock-sucking dwarf.

92
00:21:04.281 --> 00:21:05.962
Next time,
you batter that fucking ceiling,

93
00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:10.049
I'm gonna come down
and break your fucking neck,

94
00:21:10.201 --> 00:21:11.248
Fuck!

95
00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:13.168
Fucking little cocksucker.

96
00:21:13.321 --> 00:21:15.569
Don't fucking bang
that fucking ceiling

97
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.881
any-fucking-more, okay?

98
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:20.889
You cock-sucking retard!

up the arse, darling?

183
00:41:44.515 --> 00:41:49.043
- For you, darling, 50.

184
00:41:58.953 --> 00:42:00.120
- Jesus.

185
00:42:00.273 --> 00:42:01.921
Who the fuck are you?

186
00:42:03.473 --> 00:42:06.998
What the fuck have you done
to yourself?

187
00:42:09.673 --> 00:42:11.757
That's right.
Have a good stare.

188
00:42:11.912 --> 00:42:15.240
Have a good fucking stare,
you little fucking pervert!

189
00:42:15.392 --> 00:42:16.953
Fuck off now

190
00:42:17.112 --> 00:42:19.873
before I get out of this car
and smash your fucking face in!

191
00:42:20.032 --> 00:42:20.872
Don't!

192
00:42:32.191 --> 00:42:34.711
- No, please.
Please!

193
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:54.278
- Martin?

194
00:42:58.669 --> 00:43:03.873
Martin, it's me,
Dr. Sebring.

195
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:08.909
So...

196
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:10.236
this is where you work.

197
00:43:14.148 --> 00:43:15.992
This isn't right, Martin.

198
00:43:16.148 --> 00:43:18.189
What you're doing,

199
00:43:18.348 --> 00:43:22.428
it's wrong.

200
00:43:22.588 --> 00:43:25.828
Martin, I can help you,

201
00:43:25.987 --> 00:43:30.952
but you have to put
the gun down.

202
00:43:31.107 --> 00:43:33.507
Imagine what your father
would say if..

203
00:43:39.986 --> 00:43:43.347
Martin, Martin, no, Martin!

204
00:44:49.862 --> 00:44:52.426
Please.

205
00:44:52.582 --> 00:44:54.349
I'll do anything you want.

206
00:44:54.501 --> 00:44:56.585
Please!

207
00:44:56.741 --> 00:44:59.948
I won't tell...
I won't tell no one nothing.

208
00:45:00.101 --> 00:45:01.105
You fucking...

209
00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:08.225
Someone help me!

210
00:45:57.017 --> 00:45:59.505
<i>- Hi, Martin, this is Arianne,
Miss Yennie's manager.</i>

211
00:45:59.657 --> 00:46:01.577
<i>I wanted to confirm
that Miss Yennie is not delayed</i>

212
00:46:01.736 --> 00:46:03.144
<i>and will be landing
this morning</i>

213
00:46:03.296 --> 00:46:05.861
<i>on London's Heathrow Airport
at 6:00 a.m. your time.</i>

214
00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:07.936
<i>I understand your driver
will be picking her up.</i>

215
00:46:08.096 --> 00:46:09.340
<i>I hope she does
a great audition.</i>

216
00:46:09.496 --> 00:46:11.896
<i>Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye!</i>

217
00:46:37.534 --> 00:46:39.857
- God, I cannot believe
I am here

218
00:46:40.013 --> 00:46:43.221
auditioning for
a Quentin Tarantino film.

219
00:46:43.374 --> 00:46:46.101
My agents are so excited
about this.

220
00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:50.816
I should probably call them,

221
00:46:50.973 --> 00:46:54.333
tell them I landed
and, you know, I'm on my way.

222
00:46:58.652 --> 00:46:59.896
- Have you seen
<i>The Human Centipede?</i>

223
00:47:03.293 --> 00:47:04.580
- I was really drawn
to the film

224
00:47:04.732 --> 00:47:06.172
because of
the medical aspect of it.

225
00:47:06.332 --> 00:47:07.575
If you were a surgeon,

226
00:47:07.732 --> 00:47:10.012
you could actually perform
that surgery.

227
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:12.495
It's just so scary.

228
00:47:15.371 --> 00:47:17.379
It was so grueling
being on all fours,

229
00:47:17.531 --> 00:47:19.976
so I demanded in my contract
that I had to have

230
00:47:20.131 --> 00:47:21.691
an hour... long massage
every night.

231
00:47:21.851 --> 00:47:24.458
I mean, why would I not
demand that in my contract?

232
00:47:24.611 --> 00:47:26.335
Oh, and the rest of the cast,

233
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.771
we all took showers before we
shot the centipede stuff,

234
00:47:28.931 --> 00:47:31.418
because I mean, you're close
to someone's butt,

235
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.611
and you don't want to smell
anything and...

236
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.330
or, you know, whatever.

237
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:36.811
I'm kind of a germaphobe.

238
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.814
Um...

239
00:47:52.568 --> 00:47:55.733
Oh, that must be Quentin's car.

240
00:48:04.887 --> 00:48:06.371
Do you have an umbrella?

241
00:48:06.527 --> 00:48:09.975
Because this rain
will ruin my hair.

242
00:48:11.008 --> 00:48:13.692
Okay.

243
00:48:15.767 --> 00:48:17.654
Oh!

244
01:05:14.896 --> 01:05:18.737
- Please, please.

245
01:05:18.895 --> 01:05:22.223
Please don't hurt me.

246
01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:24.143
Please.

247
01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:26.423
I'll do everything.

248
01:06:48.889 --> 01:06:51.257
<i>- Hello, this Marc from
USA Actors Management again.</i>

249
01:06:51.409 --> 01:06:52.729
<i>Please disregard
my earlier message.</i>

250
01:06:52.889 --> 01:06:54.494
<i>Fortunately, Miss Williams
and Mr. Kitamura</i>

251
01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:55.969
<i>were able to reschedule,</i>

252
01:06:56.129 --> 01:06:58.016
<i>and they're really, really
excited to come to London</i>

253
01:06:58.168 --> 01:06:59.248
<i>for Mr. Tarantino's auditions.</i>

254
01:06:59.408 --> 01:07:00.293
<i>I hope it's still possible.</i>

255
01:07:00.448 --> 01:07:01.572
<i>I'm totally confident</i>

256
01:07:01.728 --> 01:07:03.136
<i>that they're gonna do
very well on this,</i>

257
01:07:03.288 --> 01:07:04.696
<i>so please call me back
as soon as possible</i>

258
01:07:04.848 --> 01:07:05.972
<i>at this number to confirm.</i>

259
01:07:06.128 --> 01:07:07.175
<i>Thanks very, very much.</i>

260
01:07:07.328 --> 01:07:08.888
<i>Talk to you soon.
Good-bye.</i>
