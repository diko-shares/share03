<i>OLIVE: The rumors of my promiscuity
have been greatly exaggerated.</i>

12
00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:10.277
<i>I used to be anonymous,
invisible to the opposite sex.</i>

13
00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.237
<i>If Google Earth were a guy,</i>

14
00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.449
<i>he couldn't find me if I was
dressed up as a 10-story building.</i>

15
00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:19.328
<i>Pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh?
A high school girl feeling anonymous.</i>

16
00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.956
<i>Who am I? What does it all mean?
Why am I here? Blah.</i>

17
00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:26.376
<i>But don't worry,
this isn't one of those tales.</i>

18
00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.504
<i>Though it sure started out that way.</i>

19
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.381
<i>And then it changed pretty quickly
when I started lying,</i>

20
00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.176
<i>about some very personal things.</i>

21
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:38.138
<i>So let the record show that I,
Olive Penderghast,</i>

22
00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:43.060
<i>being of sound mind,
and below-average breast size.</i>

23
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.395
<i>Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,</i>

24
00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:49.501
<i>and nothing but the truth.
Starting now. (Gasps as she's hit)</i>

25
00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.902
<i>And what better way
to share my private thoughts,</i>

26
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.987
<i>than to broadcast them
on the Internet?</i>

27
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.491
So here it is. Part one.

28
00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:02.663
The shudder-inducing and clichéd,
however totally false account

29
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:07.042
of how I lost my virginity
to a guy at a community college.

30
00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:12.047
Let me just begin by saying
that there are two sides to every story.

31
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.134
And this is my side, the right one.

32
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.052
Rhiannon: George is not a sexy name.

33
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.138
George is like what you name
your teddy bear,

34
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.640
Rhiannon: not the name you wanna
scream out during climax.

35
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.560
And by that, I assume you mean?

36
00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.271
The stable and self-perpetuating
end stage

37
00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:29.314
in the evolution
of a plant community.

38
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.150
- Right.
- Why, what were you thinking?

39
00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:35.237
Same, but I don't say it out loud
lest someone get the wrong idea.

40
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.323
I think you know innuendo
is attached to everything these days.

41
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.534
Innuendo? What...,
whatever do you mean?

42
00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:44.204
Rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books.
They don't hit back.

43
00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:48.917
Also, hugs not drugs.
Mess with the bull, get the horns.

44
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.670
And any other clichés
you can come up with.

45
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.298
<i>(Laughs)</i> Bye, Mr. Griffith.

46
00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:55.757
Bye.

47
00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.385
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

48
00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.888
<i>Olive: Mr. Griffith is
my favorite teacher.</i>

49
00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.015
<i>Although,
after all the trouble I caused,</i>

50
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.434
<i>I don't know if I'm still
his favorite student.</i>

51
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.060
You know, these are bad for you.

52
00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:10.731
It leads to unwanted pregnancy,
all sorts of things.

53
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.735
Mismatched tires on your vehicle,
which is nonexistent.

54
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:19.198
<i>And here is where the trouble began.
The lie that started the whole thing.</i>

55
00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:23.243
Please, please, I'm begging you.
I..I will pay you. I'll pay you.

56
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.245
Rhi, I cannot go camping
with you, okay?

57
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.122
I'm sorry, but I have a date.

58
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.917
- Okay? I told you.
- Oh, with who?

59
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.420
- You don't know him.
- And neither do you, you selfish bitch.

60
00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.923
Yes, I do.
He goes to college with my brother.

61
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.674
Okay, what's his name, then?

62
00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:40.677
<i>Olive: Rhiannon is what you'd call
a strong personality.</i>

63
00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.138
<i>A couple weeks ago she asked
me to come camping with her family,</i>

64
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.224
<i>and I don't know why
I didn't wanna go.</i>

65
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:48.602
<i>A little because I didn't really feel like
hanging out with her all weekend.</i>

66
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.105
<i>But mostly because her parents are
the weirdest people I have ever met,</i>

67
00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.566
<i>and I live in California.</i>

68
00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.277
<i>I ate dinner at her house once
and I swore, never again.</i>

69
00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.738
- This is interesting.
- Patchouli burger.

70
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.990
We grew it in our victory garden.

71
00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.617
Rhiannon's Father:
You want some dessert?

72
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.245
No, thank you.
I'm trying to watch my figure.

73
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.205
Rhiannon's Mother: Well, I'm not.

74
00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.166
<i>Olive: So I lied and told her
I couldn't go,</i>

75
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.419
<i>because I had a date with a friend
of my brother's named, George.</i>

76
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.673
Let's just face it, there is no such thing
as a sexy-George. All right.

77
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.258
Yeah, well, mine is,

78
00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.928
so I think we should just
put this conversation to bed.

79
00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.848
Fine, don't go camping with us.
Just know I hate you, bitch.

80
00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.351
Go get your chocolate milk.

81
00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.646
- Do you want one?
- No.

82
00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.440
<i>Olive: And here's how I really spent
the weekend.</i>

83
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:43.109
<i>♪ Gotta pocket, gotta pocket full of sunshine... ♪</i>

84
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.451
Blech!
The worst song ever.

85
00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:51.412
<i>♪ I gotta pocket, gotta pocket
full of sunshine. ♪</i>

86
00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:56.640

87
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.256

88
00:05:00.257 --> 00:05:05.340
<i>♪ Sticks and stones are never

89
00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:10.220

90
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:12.227

<i>(Card stops playing)</i>

95
00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.673
<i>(Crickets chirping)</i>

96
00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:36.543
<i>Olive: But, on Monday.
When Rhi asked how my weekend was.</i>

97
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.212
He was charming, you know?
He was a real gentleman.

98
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.632
And it feels like, like I got a love
and I know that it's all mine.

99
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.552
Okay, okay. Wait, wait.
So are you going to see him again?

100
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.014
No, no, I'll probably not. You know,
it was just one of those weekends.

101
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.766
A whole weekend?

102
00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.434
Yup.

103
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.865
- Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
- What?

104
00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:57.731
- You didn't have...
- No, no, of course not.

105
00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.068
You liar. You totally
lost your V-card to him.

106
00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:02.861
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

107
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.572
- Tell me everything.
- Rhi, I'm not that kind of girl.

108
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.075
Oh really, the kind that does it,
or the kind that does it,

109
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.577
and doesn't have the lady-balls
to tell her best friend?

110
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.412
- What?
- I want every detail.

111
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.914
- Rhi.
- Now, bitch.

112
00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.999
You know, you call me 'bitch' a lot.
Okay?

113
00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:19.294
- It's not really a term of endearment.
- I want every detail. Now, shitface.

114
00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.421
You're not really heading
in the right direction.

115
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.006
Tell me.

116
00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.758
Fine.

117
00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:27.302
We did it.

118
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.595
Yes!

119
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.056
Finally.
Now you're a super slut like me.

120
00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.683
I don't think letting Peter Hedlund
motorboat you,

121
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:36.937
behind a Bed Bath & Beyond
really makes you a super slut.

122
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.399
There were a lot of people walking
past, okay. Someone could've easily seen.

123
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.277
- Mmm hmm.
- Whatever. This isn't about me, this is about you.

124
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:45.487
What'd you let him do?

125
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:50.575
It was normal. You know?
Nothing, uh...freaky.

126
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.994
<i>Olive: I don't know why I did it.</i>

127
00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:55.622
<i>I guess maybe it was because
it was the first time</i>

128
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.250
<i>I had sort of felt superior to, Rhi.</i>

129
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.795
<i>But I just started piling on lie after lie.
It was like setting up Jenga.</i>

130
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.463
Do you like, Glade candles?

131
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.967
Those kind, but they were like,
sexy Glade candles.

132
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.845
He was sweet. He was...

133
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.227
What the hell are you looking at,
Sister Christian?

134
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.771
Just a couple of admitted whores.

135
00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.860
<i>Olive: Marianne Bryant is the secretary
of the student council,</i>

136
00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:27.446
<i>chairman of the Orange Blossom
dance committee,</i>

137
00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.823
<i>and the president of
the Cross Your Heart Club.</i>

138
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.034
<i>A club dedicated to shoving
their beliefs down people's throats.</i>

139
00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:34.661
Obviously they don't care.

140
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.789
<i>Last year's cause celeb was
the changing of the school mascot.</i>

141
00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:42.043
Give it up for your
very own Blue Devils!

142
00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:44.212
Bluuuue!
<i>(Crowd cheers)</i>

143
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.756
Blue Devil!

144
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.677
Yeah.

145
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.680
Yeah!

146
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.767
How can we exhibit school pride
when we're conveyed to others,

147
00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:59.561
as Satan worshippers?

148
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.190
<i>Olive: Now, thankfully,
we're the much less intimidating,</i>

149
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.526
Give it up for the Woodchucks!

150
00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:08.987
Hey! Go, Woodchucks!

151
00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.448
Todd: Woodchucks!

152
00:08:11.832 --> 00:08:14.832
<i>(Gnawing sounds on wood)</i>

153
00:08:15.902 --> 00:08:17.954
WHOOO!

154
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:20.081
I liked Todd much better
when he was topless.

155
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:23.418
Yeah, but even dressed as a
woodchuck, I still fantasize about him.

156
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:25.212
<i>(Crowd cheering)</i>
Woodchucks.

157
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.923
<i>(Crowd gasps)</i>

158
00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.050
<i>Olive: Now Marianne had
a new cause celeb.</i>

159
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:31.718
<i>Me.</i>

160
00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.346
Which brings us to part two.

161
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:38.266
The accelerated velocity
of terminological inexactitude.

162
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:43.104
<i>Which is really just my obnoxious way
of saying that lies travel fast.</i>

163
00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:47.901
<i>And, boy, did my terminological

164
00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.500

<i>♪ I don't know how to love him, ♪</i>

166

<i>♪  So I know, how to love him so. ♪</i>

169
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.103
- She's not a virgin anymore?
- I can't believe it.

170
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.105
- Olive lost her virginity.
- Yeah.

171
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:29.442
Maybe next time a certain somebody
will be a little more careful

172
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.319
what she says in the water closet.

173
00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.614
Yeah, about that? It's, uh,
that's actually not what you think.

174
00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:36.950
Can I, uh talk to you alone
for a second?

175
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:40.245
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

176
00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.165
Bye, Nina.

177
00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:49.170
Uh, what you heard in the bathroom
the other day wasn't true at all.

178
00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:52.799
- Um, it's actually a funny story.
- Olive, that's your name, right?

179
00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:56.303
Yeah, yeah. And you're Marianne.

180
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.847
Uh, we've had nine classes together,
since kindergarten.

181
00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:02.017
Ten, if you count Religion
of Other Cultures, which you didn't,

182
00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:04.144
because you called it
science fiction and refused to go.

183
00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.980
Yeah, listen, I'm not the one
that you have to answer to,

184
00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.565
for your depraved behavior.

185
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.610
There's a higher power
that will judge you for your indecency.

186
00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.653
Tom Cruise?

187
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.239
I hope for your sake
that God has a sense of humor.

188
00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:20.035
Oh, I have 17 years' worth
of anecdotal proof he does.

189
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.120
You've made your bed.

190
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.956
I just hope for your sake
that you've cleaned the sheets.

191
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.668
Did I just get saved?

192
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.547
<i>Olive: So Marianne spread the rumor.</i>

193
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:36.051
<i>For the first time ever, my sexual
exploits were the talk of school.</i>

194
00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:38.678
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm wrong.
It was the second time.</i>

195
00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:40.847
<i>The first time was back
in 8th grade,</i>

196
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:44.684
<i>when all I wanted was a kiss from
this guy I had always had a crush on.</i>

197
00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:48.104
<i>Todd and I were thrown together
in seven minutes of Heaven.</i>

198
00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:54.736
<i>Luckily we had a super romantic
song from our youth to set the mood.

199
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:58.338
I think this is the part where you're
suppose to stick your tongue in my mouth.

200
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.575
That's what I've heard, anyway.

201
00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.100
Just give me a second, okay?
<i>(Nervously laughs)</i>

202
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.872
According to my watch,
you have 382 of them.

203
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.290
- How do you do that?
- What?

204
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.751
Add so fast.
And you also talk like a grown-up.

205
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.213
Don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart
as I think I am.

206
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:19.219
So if we didn't do anything,
could you still tell people we kissed?

207
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:23.515
Absolutely.

208
00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:25.850
- Thanks, Olive.
- Sure, Todd.

209
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.895
<i>Olive: Actually didn't wanna lie that time.</i>

210
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.690
<i>Although when people thought
I'd kissed someone, they didn't really care.</i>

211
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:33.942
<i>But when they thought that
I slept with someone.</i>

212
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.569
Hey, Olive. How's it going?

213
00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:39.406
I'm swell,
Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before.

214
00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:41.491
Thanks for asking.

215
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:46.913
<i>Olive: All I could think to myself was,
"Great, now I'm a tramp".</i>

216
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.082
<i>I'm gonna have to get
a lower-back tattoo,</i>

217
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.543
<i>and pierce something
not on my face.</i>

218
00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.212
Olive: You guys know that
I was here all weekend, right?

219
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.797
- Yeah.
- Yes, you were upstairs.

220
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.507
- Dill: Yeah.
- You would testify to that?

221
00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.634
- Rosemary: Yeah.
- I would take a bullet for you.

222
00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.553
You know that.
Right between the eyes.

223
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.013
Man, I would slit my throat,

224
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.099
rather than say something
to someone,

225
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.935
- that you didn't want me to say.
- That's not necessary, Dad.

226
00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.896
- But that is comforting.
- That's how I am, it's how I roll.

227
00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.815
Dill: That's how I do, as they say.

228
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:17.527
- I like the pants.
- Thank you. They're Costco.

229
00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.571
You can have them when you
get a little taller if you want.

230
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.240
- I'm never gonna go through puberty.
- Rosemary: Course you will, baby.

231
00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.284
But we're a family of late bloomers.

232
00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:27.203
I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive.

233
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:29.289
Why does that matter? I'm adopted.

234
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.168
<i>(Dill pounds fist on wall)</i>
WHAT? Oh, my God. Who told you?

235
00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:36.713
Guys, we were gonna do this
at the right time.

236
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:37.922
Listen to me.

237
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.217
Sometimes, even when a man and
a woman loves each other very much,

238
00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.052
like your mother and I used to.

239
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.930
Their insides just don't cooperate
with each other.

240
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.348
Rosemary: So, what's going on, honey?

241
00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:50.643
Why do you want us to take a bullet
if anyone asks if you were here,
all weekend?

242
00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:53.146
It's nothing. It's just the rumor mill.

243
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.483
What's the rumor mill churning out
these days? Anything interesting?

244
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.694
You know, not really. Not really.
It's a little low on grist.

245
00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.655
Ooo, clever wordplay. I like it very much.
You must be related to me.

246
00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:04.991
- Only by marriage.
- Give it to me.

247
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.494
Olive: So, what we're all gonna
take away from this?

248
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:10.371
- Olive: I was here all weekend, right?
- Dill and Rosemary: Yes, yes, yes.

249
00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:13.833
<i>Olive: Remember how I told you
Google Earth couldn't find me</i>

250
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:16.127
<i>if I was dressed up
as a ten-story building?</i>

251
00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:20.089
<i>Well, the next day it could find me if I
was dressed as a crack on a sidewalk.</i>

252
00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:22.509
<i>That's the beauty of being
a girl in high school.</i>

253
00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:26.179
<i>People hear you had sex once
and bam, you're a bimbo.</i>

254
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.890
<i>I really didn't mean for the lie
to put me on the map,</i>

255
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:32.227
<i>but I gotta admit,
I kind of liked being on the map.</i>

256
00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:36.648
Mr. Griffith: So, clearly
Nathaniel Hawthorne is a complex writer.

257
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.441
Even I had trouble with him.

258
00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.694
I read him originally when I was 5,
but I struggled.

259
00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:44.823
So I'm gonna break it down for you.
I'm gonna throw some rhymes.

260
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.991
Anson, drop me a beat.

261
00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.868
- What?
- Give me a beat.

262
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:50.912
Push it up.

263
00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.666
<i>Raps: Yeah, adultery, vengeance</i>

264
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.168
<i>Crimes of passion</i>

265
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.379
Kill the beat.
I'm not gonna rap for you guys, okay.

266
00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:01.589
It's pandering
and it's been done before,

267
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:04.884
in every bad movie
you've ever seen. Okay.

268
00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:07.679
<i>Olive: Ironically, we were studying
The Scarlet Letter.</i>

269
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.722
<i>Now, isn't that always the way?</i>

270
00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.059
<i>The books you read in class always
seem to have some strong connection</i>

271
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:16.062
<i>with whatever angsty
adolescent drama is going on.</i>

272
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.190
<i>Except for Huckleberry Finn.
'Cause I don't know any teenage boys,</i>

273
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.943
<i>who have ever run away
with a big, hulking black guy.</i>

274
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.571
For those of who haven't read
The Scarlet Letter,

275
00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:28.408
or for those who said you did
but really didn't, here's all
you need to know.

276
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.411
<i>Olive: This girl, Hester Prynne,

<i>is besmirched and made to wear
a red A for 'adulterer'.</i>

<i>A whole bunch

281
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.634
If you have a test on it, rent the movie,
but make sure it's the original.

282
00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:50.430
Not the Demi Moore version where
she talks in a fake British accent,

283
00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.348
and takes a lot of baths.

284
00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:54.958
To say that one was freely adapted
is a...

285
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:57.437
<i>(Bad cockney accent)</i>
Bit o' an understate-mant, guvnor.

286
00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.606
What we have to realize,

287
00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:03.067
is that Hester lived
in an entirely different time.

288
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:09.449
Mr. Griffith: A time when the worst crime
a woman could commit was in fact, adultery.

289

Mr. Griffith: Nina.

290
00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.411
I think Hester Prynne was,

291
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:16.122
excuse my language, a skank.

292
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.750
A skank? So you don't think
she was a victim at all?

293
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.127
Why should I?
She brought it on herself.

294
00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:26.966
Perhaps you should embroider a red A
on your wardrobe, you abominable tramp.

295
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:30.970
Perhaps you should get a wardrobe,
you abominable twat.

<i>Olive: Not my best line,

<i>(Stapler slammed hard)</i>

299
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:47.654

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.366
Seems as if someone's
practicing the mundane activities,

301
00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:53.701
she'll be saddled with
the rest of her pathetic life.

302
00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:56.801
I just hope, for your sake, you at least
had the good sense to use protection.

303
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.289
Why? Your parents didn't.

304

So why am I just meeting you?

311
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.651
Language like this would've
warranted a visit years ago.

312
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:30.863
This is the first time I have done anything
remotely misbehavioral.

313
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:32.156
This is foul.

314
00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:34.575
I know. I am so...
I'm really, really sorry.

315
00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.036
Sorry you said it
or sorry you got caught?

316
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:39.163
Sorry I said it, honestly.

317
00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:42.959
And sorry I got caught a little bit too,
but mostly just sorry I said it.

318
00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:47.046
If you use a word like this again in my
school, it'll be your last. You understand?

319
00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:48.256
Yes, sir. Yes.

320
00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.883
I mean, this isn't one of
those progressive schools,

321
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:53.553
where the teachers are called
by their first names,

322
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:56.347
and students
are partners in learning,

323
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:59.475
and there's a fundraising auction
at the end of the year.

324
00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:02.895
Where the more creative parents
put on musical skits,

325
00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:05.064
about the community garden.

326
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.942
This is public school.

327
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:12.530
If I can keep the girls off the pole and
the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.

328
00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.241
Now, if you're sent to me
one more time,

329
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.786
you're gonna be out on your fantail.
Now, am I making myself clear?

330
00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:20.079
Yes, sir.

331
00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.040
- Good.
- I think so.

332
00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:26.127
I mean, I got a little lost in
the middle, but I found my way back.

333
00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:28.087
Detention after school tomorrow.

334
00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:31.257
Now, 'pffft' out.

335
00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:36.971
<i>Olive: Even though it was my slutty alter ego
that said a bad word in school,</i>

336
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.390
<i>it was my ass that got in trouble.</i>

337
00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:42.560
<i>Which was a place my ass
had never been before.</i>

338
00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.192
Hey, Olive.

339
00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:52.153
Oh, my God. The illusion is shattered.

340
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.782
This is exactly when they put you in the gas chamber
if you take your head off at Disney World.

341
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:58.618
I think they just fire you.
You're thinking of Disneyland.

342
00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.620
- Disney World is much more liberal.
- Oh, yeah.

343
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.664
I always forget Disney World
went blue in the last election.

344
00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:05.708
Are you going to Melody Bostic's party?

345
00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:07.460
I hadn't planned on it.

346
00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:10.671
Hmm, me neither. My cousin's getting
married. It's a rehearsal dinner.

347
00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:13.466
See you. Stay excellent.

348
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:14.967
You too.

349
00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:16.427
- Todd: What's up, kid?
- Kid: Woodchuck.

350
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.931
Please tell me the rumors are true.

351
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.558
Yes. Yes, I am a big, fat slut.

352
00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:26.187
No, no not that one. The one where you got
suspended for calling Nina Howell a dick,

353
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.439
and punching her in the left tit.

354
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:32.110
I worry about the way information
circulates at this school.

355
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.446
Rhi? I need to tell you something.

356
00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:38.491
Like the exact moment
you turned into such a badass?

357
00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.493
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Okay.

358
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:43.329
Please tell me you at least left a mark
on that little scrunched-up face of hers?

359
00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:45.331
- It's not true.
- It wasn't the left tit?

360
00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:48.334
It was the right one.
I always pegged you for a southpaw.

361
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:50.155
Can you listen to me
for one second, please?

362
00:18:50.156 --> 00:18:54.465
-Pow, pow, pow!
-Okay, it didn't happen.

363
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:58.511
Oh, yeah, right. Your secret's safe
with me, you little sex monkey.

364
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.143
I got sent to the principal today.

365
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.395
Did you win a medal or something?

366
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:08.604
Not exactly.

367
00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:13.359
I used inappropriate language
in English class.

368
00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.529
Although we're reading a book
that I personally deem

369
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:20.533
wildly inappropriate for our age group,
so I actually felt it was quite apropos.

370
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:21.951
What did you say?

371
00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.205
Let's just say it was
an inappropriate word.

372
00:19:26.373 --> 00:19:27.707
Well, what did it start with?

373
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.251
A snide comment
from a snotty girl in my class.

374
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:33.796
No, I mean what letter
did the word start with?

375
00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:35.590
- Ah, T.
- Oh, T.

376
00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:40.219
- T? Let us think. T, T, T.
- T. All right, T. Yeah, T.

377
00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:44.724
- T, T, T.
- T, T, T.

378
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:50.207
Both: T, T, T, T, T,
To, toe...

379
00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:55.735
Both: T, T, T, T, T, T...T, T...

380
00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.737
- Guys.
- Noun, adjective or verb?

381
00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:01.032
Noun, it's definitely slang.
Think British.

382
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.075
Tally whacker? Termagant?

383
00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:06.746
Yob, frast, nunt.

384
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:08.831
You're just saying sounds.
Those are sounds.

385
00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.918
- Spell it with your peas.
- Oh yeah, spell it with your peas. Do it.

386
00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:13.753
- I will take that challenge.
- Dill: Do it.

387
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:15.254
I like that, all right.

388
00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:17.715
So does this have anything to do
with the rumor,

389
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.926
that you mentioned the other night?

390
00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:23.387
Dill: Do you need to talk to us
about something, sweetie?

391
00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.514
Chip: What's a twit?

392
00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:27.433
Rosemary: That's an 'A', honey.

393
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:29.852
And it's a word that'll get you sent
to the principal's office.

394
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.187
It's a bad word, sit down.

395
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.898
I guess we're lucky that this
is not a common occurrence.

396
00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.108
What would my punishment
have been otherwise?

397
00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:39.862
- Bed without supper, I guess.
- But I'm already finished.

398
00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:43.282
- No dating. No dating.
- Yeah, no dating.

399
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.451
- Dill: No dating for you, young lady.
- Rosemary: No dating.

400
00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:47.870
I think my complete lack of allure,

401
00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:50.623
already kind of shot that horse in the face.

402
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.960
I wouldn't know how to be grounded
anymore than you know how to ground.

403
00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:56.462
That's right. Love you, come here.

404
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.341
And I bet that girl was acting
like exactly what you called her.

405
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:01.634
Oh, you have no idea.

406
00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:06.305
Chip: I got a B-plus
on my spelling test today.

407
00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:10.059
That's good, honey, but everything
has spell check these days, so...

408
00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:11.394
Just kidding.

409
00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:15.564
Where are you from originally?

410
00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.692
<i>Olive: So the next day
I had detention.</i>

411
00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:21.153
<i>Which, thanks to recent
budget cuts, meant cleaning.</i>

412
00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:23.739
<i>I was looking forward to
getting all this behind me.</i>

413
00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:26.492
<i>I had done the crime.
I was gonna do the time.</i>

414
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.869
<i>And that would be that,
but that...</i>

415
00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:31.831
Aren't there, like,
child labor laws against this?

416
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.124
Not in high school.

417
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:37.461
The principal's like the captain
of the ship in international waters.

418
00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.255
He can even marry people.

419
00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.925
We haven't talked in a while.
How have you been, Brandon?

420
00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:46.762
Fabulous, I'm crushing it.
Everything according to plan.

421
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.931
I wanna be in detention.

422
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.349
Yeah, why are you here?

423
00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.852
Judging from the amount of blood
I saw gushing out of your nose,

424
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.145
I thought you were the bullied.

425
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.523
You think that Principal Gibbons is a homophobe,
which is why I called him a fascist.

426
00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:01.027
- So the rumors are true.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:03.821
I meant about Gibbons being a fascist.

428
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:08.367
Brandon: So, what's with your new look?
Very whore couture.

429
00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:11.871
Oh, haven't you heard?
I'm the new school slut.

430
00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:15.624
You know, I did hear something.
I also heard he was twice your age.

431
00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:18.377
Oh, no, no, no.
No, he was a freshman in college.

432
00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:20.671
I also heard he gave you crabs.

433
00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:23.549
- Eww, people suck.
- Tell me about it.

434
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.136
He's not real.

435
00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:31.891
- What?
- The guy I slept with. I made him up.

436
00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.060
Wait, you started the rumor?

437
00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:36.270
Indirectly, I guess sort of.

438
00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:40.733
Or actually, no.
No, not really. No, I didn't.

439
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.861
Well, but you're perpetuating it.
That's really messed up.

440
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.154
Excuse me?

441
00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:48.407
Well, you're not even a real slut.
You just want people to think you are.

442
00:22:48.575 --> 00:22:50.076
It's pathetic.

443
00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:55.081
Uh, no offense, but uh, you could probably
learn something from me, Brando.

444
00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:59.960
Are you saying that...that I should
act straight so people will like me?

445
00:23:00.128 --> 00:23:03.923
That's groundbreaking. You should
teach a course at 'The Learning Annex'.

446
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:07.176
It could be called "The Painfully
Obvious with Olive Penderghast,

447
00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:08.636
the Fake School Slut".

448
00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:11.931
I was just suggesting that
maybe these kids we call peers,

449
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.767
are onto something.
You know, like Marianne Bryant.

450
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:19.897
Maybe that whole stuck-up,
Jesus-freak thing is an act. You know?

451
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.441
No, I think she's just
a stuck-up Jesus freak.

452
00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:25.861
And there are some of us who are
just trying to blend in, to the crowd.

453
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:29.031
Well, then you've gotta do
everything you can to blend in,

454
00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:30.950
or decide not to care.

455
00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:34.870
I can't decide if you're a genius
or a lunatic.

456
00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:39.041
Well, don't they sort of go
hand in hand?

457
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:43.921
- Rhiannon: So you heard any word from, George?
- Olive: Nope.

458
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:48.801
I told you, that was a one-night stand,
which is now over.

459
00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:51.053
You know, you're being pretty
cavalier about this.

460
00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:53.639
Aren't you supposed to be like,
eternally in love with him, and shit?

461
00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:57.476
Yes, I believe so. If I was "A Gossip Girl
in Sweet Valley with traveling pants".

462
00:23:57.644 --> 00:24:01.981
But Uhh, no, I'm not.
So I could really care less.

463
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:04.316
Okay, so Brandy Carter
was telling Vanessa Hodges,

464
00:24:04.484 --> 00:24:07.319
that you were with three guys
in a Jacuzzi.

465
00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:09.405
Sounds like a lot of work.

466
00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:13.117
Olive: I guess that's still better than
getting it on with some old dude.

467
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.618
Eww, who said that?

468
00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:18.747
Uh, do you know that Brandon kid?
That's what somebody told him.

469
00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:19.999
Isn't he a homo?

470
00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:22.001
Yeah.

471
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.717
<i>♪ (Cell Phone playing
"Pocket full of Sunshine") ♪</i>

472
00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:29.967
Speak of the devil. Hello.

473
00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.845
I was just talking about you
with my friend, Rhiannon.

474
00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:36.432
You know Rhiannon.
She's a perpetually angry.

475
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.684
She curses like a Somali sailor. Bi...

476
00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:41.312
- Yeah. That's the one.
- "Bi..."? "Bi..."? What's "bi-"?

477
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.148
- Okay.
- What's Bi..I wanna know what "bi..." is.

478
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.025
Hello, what's "bi..."? What is "bi..."?

- Bye.

Bedazzling personality?
Beautiful, beautiful soul?

- Big tits.
- That's my identifier?

Yes!

All right, well, that was Brandon. He
needs to talk to me about something.

484
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:03.584
- Probably wants to borrow an outfit.
- Mmm, whatever, Big Tits.

485
00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:05.294
Heck, yeah!

486
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.880
Woo hoo!
Big tits!

487
00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:10.841
The next day,
things took a turn for the scandalous

488
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.968
which brings us to part three.

489
00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:16.889
A lady's choice
and a gentleman's agreement.

490

<i>(Knock, knock)</i>

491
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.905
Hi, is there an Olive here?

492
00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:35.241
There's a whole jar of them
in the fridge.

493
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:37.576
I'm sorry,
I must have the wrong address.

494
00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:39.078
Just kidding. Come on in.

495
00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:43.165
Any friend of Olive's
is a friend of our daughter's.

496
00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:45.334
Olive, sweetie.

497
00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:47.586
There's a young man
here to see you.

498
00:25:47.754 --> 00:25:51.423
<i>(Southern-Belle accent)</i> He said something
about asking for your hand in marriage.

499
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:53.884
<i>(Southern-Belle accent)</i>
Oh, happy day, Mama!

500
00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:56.387
Oh, I thought I was gonna have
to spend my dowry

501
00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:59.390
on booze and pills
to numb the loneliness.

502
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.892
Olive: A gentleman caller, hurray!

503
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.395
- What's that?
- Olive has a boy in her room.

504
00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:05.729
- <i>(gasps)</i> A boy?
- A boy.

505
00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:08.107
- Dill: Wow, a boy.
- Rosemary: A boy.

506
00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:09.942
A boy?

507
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.245
- A boy.
- Wow.

508
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.448
Welcome.
This is where the magic happens.

509
00:26:16.616 --> 00:26:18.284
And as you all know by magic,
I mean nothing.

510
00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:20.077
- Do you wanna go out with me?
- What?

511
00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:22.913
Well, I mean, like,
do you wanna be my girlfriend?

512
00:26:24.044 --> 00:26:28.544
Uh, Brandon, just a couple hours ago
you told me you were 'Kinsey Six' gay.

513
00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:31.463
True, but you said I should
pretend to be straight, so.

514
00:26:31.631 --> 00:26:33.465
Yeah, I didn't mean with me.

515
00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:38.596
I mean, you're a nice guy and all,
but you're not really uh, my type.

516
00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.556
Yeah, you're not really
my type either.

517
00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:43.642
Yeah, I know that. I got that V
where you'd rather see a P.

518
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.477
Do you wanna
have sex with me or not?

519
00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:47.605
Oh, my God, dude.

520
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.231
Wow, you completely missed
the point of that.

521
00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:52.151
- That is not what I was saying at all.
- No, I know what you were saying.

522
00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:54.820
That I should act straight
until I get out of this hellhole.

523
00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:57.156
Then I can be whoever I wanna be.
I get that.

524
00:26:57.324 --> 00:27:00.159
And you know that I didn't reallyh have sex
with a college guy, right?

525
00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:02.077
I just told everybody I did.

526
00:27:02.245 --> 00:27:05.831
Actually, I told one person I did.
And you know how these things work.

527
00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:07.166
It's like wildfire.

528
00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:10.919
So you're saying
I shouldn't really have sex?

529
00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:14.798
I should just say I had sex
with someone. A girl.

530
00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:17.343
Yes, yes.

531
00:27:18.371 --> 00:27:19.371
<i>(Groans)</i>

532
00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:26.352
Oh, no.

533
00:27:26.603 --> 00:27:29.730
- Wai... Just...
- Oh, no, no, no.

534
00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:33.025
- No way! No way!
- Just wait. Wait, wait. Stop it, stop it.

535
00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:35.527
- Absolutely not.
- Think about it. Think about it.

536
00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:37.946
- We could help each other out.
- No.

537
00:27:38.114 --> 00:27:40.699
You wanna maintain
this floozy facade.

538
00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:44.036
I don't wanna get pushed into shit
every day. It's a win-win-win.

539
00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:46.372
How do you know I like
being thought of as a floozy?

540
00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:48.624
Because at least
you're being thought of.

541
00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:51.835
Just one good imaginary bonk.

542
00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:54.546
You are on crack, all right.
And not the good kind.

543
00:27:54.714 --> 00:27:56.048
Look it doesn't have to be a bonk.

544
00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:58.717
It could anything, it could be an imaginary
butterbean, lemon squeeze, cow bells.

545
00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:02.096
- I don't know what any of that means.
- Well that's because you're a virgin.

546
00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:04.390
You know what?
This is not the answer at all.

547
00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:05.934
I'll pay you, I'll pay you whatever you want.

548
00:28:05.935 --> 00:28:07.643
I don't want your money, Brandon.

549
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:09.812
Why don't you just do what I did
and make someone up.

550
00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:13.270
Who's going to believe me?
Hmmm?

551
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.820
Look you don't understand how hard it is,
all right? I'm tormented.

552
00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:22.199
And every day at school
is like I'm being suffocated.

553
00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.743
And sure, we can sit
and fantasize all we want

554
00:28:24.911 --> 00:28:27.371
about how things
are gonna be different one day

555
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.415
but this is today and it sucks.

556
00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:32.793
All right, and there's only one way around it.
You were smart enough to think of it.

557
00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:35.546
So please, just help me.

558
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:39.383
'Cause I can't take another day
of this. I don't know what I'll do.

559
00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:49.768
I don't do anything half-assed.
All right?

560
00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:51.437
It'll have to be a public event.

561
00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:54.022
Melody Bostic is throwing
a party tomorrow night.

562
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:58.110
All of your tormentors will be there.
You and I are going together. All right?

563
00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:02.448
You have to do everything I say and
tell everyone that I am sensational.

564
00:29:02.615 --> 00:29:05.743
- Thank you so much for doing this.
- Just,

565
00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:09.580
you know, make sure you're ready
to live with the consequences.

566
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:10.789
Right.

567
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.710
- What the hell is a lemon squeezed?
- It's like a backwards melon bag.

568
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:17.921
How don't I know any of this?

569
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:22.468
<i>Olive: The next night was the party
at Melody Bostic's house.</i>

570
00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:24.970
<i>She is the most
popular girl in school.</i>

571
00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:27.681
<i>It's partly because she's pretty
and has perfect hair.</i>

572
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:30.768
<i>But mostly because her parents
let her have these huge parties</i>

573
00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:33.395
<i>every time she catches them
doing it in the pool.</i>

574
00:29:33.563 --> 00:29:36.690
<i>Which is every week, apparently.</i>

575
00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:39.818
<i>Brandon and I showed up
when it was in full swing.</i>

576
00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:43.113
<i>I borrowed a dress from my mom,
Brandon borrowed a jacket from me</i>

577
00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.199
<i>and we put on a little show.</i>

578
00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:48.035
Hey, Olive and Brandon.

579
00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.495
Brandon: What's up?

580
00:29:49.662 --> 00:29:53.040
I hope you don't mind, but we had
a few pre-cocktail-party cocktails,

581
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:56.293
like, before the cocktail party
with cocktails.

582
00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:01.131
Listen, here's the sitch,
Melody Bostic.

583
00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:05.928
Brandon was just in the middle
of telling me this really funny thing

584
00:30:06.095 --> 00:30:07.262
which is really funny.

585
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.225
And I was wondering if um, there's,
like, a room where we could go.

586
00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:14.686
Where he could finish telling me
that thing that's funny

587
00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:16.146
If you know what I mean.

588
00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.606
You can use my room.

589
00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.526
Down the hall to the left.

590
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:24.029
Cool.

591
00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:27.282
Is that Olive with Brandon?

592
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.368
I know, what the hell, right?

593
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:31.245
You guys are my buddies.

594
00:30:31.412 --> 00:30:33.038
I'm drunk, bitches. What's up?

595
00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:34.706
I love your room!

596
00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:37.209
Melody: My sheets. Put a towel down.

597
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:41.088
- <i>(Guy from crowd)</i> Olive's gonna do a gay dude.
- Thanks. Close the shades.

598
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.302
- No, no, no. What are you doing?
- Relax.

599
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.139
Jesus, what is with you gays? Are you
really that repulsed by lady parts?

600
00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:53.559
What do you think I have down there,
a gnome?

601
00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:03.652
So nice. What is that, lavender?
It's pretty.

602
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.530
What are you doing? Can you...?
Can you come here, please?

603
00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.866
Jacket off, come on.

604
00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:12.661
All right, come on.
Chop-chop, all right.

605
00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:15.205
Now grunt, grunt and
make it convincing.

<i>(Grunts like horse)</i>

607
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:19.918

Just grunt.

Yeah, yeah!

619
00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:54.446
Uh, you don't have to be
so aggressive about it.

620
00:31:54.447 --> 00:31:56.629
You don't like that?
Oh, you don't like that!

621
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.604
- No, I don't like that.
- No, how about that.

622
00:31:58.605 --> 00:31:59.935
- You like that?
- Uh, a little better.

623

Yeah, you like that.

624
00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:02.794
I like that.

00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:05.923
This guy, he's gay, no?

626
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.592
- Don't stop!
- Keep going.

627
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.969
- Olive: Don't stop.
- Brandon: I'm not gonna stop.

628

I'm not gonna stop.

629
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.972
Now you try. You try.

630
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.310
I'm gonna turn you around
and take you from the back.

631
00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:20.979
That's not gonna make people
think you're straight.

632
00:32:21.147 --> 00:32:25.317
Never mind that gayness
because I'm a straight guy. Roar!

633
00:32:28.821 --> 00:32:31.323
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

634
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:33.659
- That's awesome! That's perfect!
- Yeah!

635
00:32:33.826 --> 00:32:35.452
That's what I'm talking about!

636
00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:39.719
Do you smell that? Do you smell us?
<i>(Slapping)</i> Ow, ow, ow.

637

Did he just say it smelled?
Crowd: Ewwww.

638
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.260
- Isn't it supposed to smell?
- I don't know.

639
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:46.964
But if it does, you're
not suppose to comment on it.

640
00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:51.593
- It doesn't really smell that bad.
- Oh, yeah. Yes, God!

641

- Olive: Don't stop. Yeah!
- Brandon: Don't stop. It's too much fun.

- Yeah. What? <i>(Groans)</i>

- He seems like a nice kid.

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:41.972
He seemed a little incredibly gay.

that boy is.

<i>Olive: I didn't know what they
were so upset about.</i>

821
00:42:35.351 --> 00:42:38.096
<i>I put an A on my wardrobe
just like they asked.</i>

822
00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:41.599
<i>Maybe it was because I was wearing
clothes that were two sizes too small.</i>

823
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:43.101
Todd: Hey, Olive!

824
00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:47.981
You uh, left your glass slipper
at the party the other night.

825
00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:52.080
Yeah, and I got pumpkin all
over my dress too, <i>c'est la vie.</i>

826
00:42:52.081 --> 00:42:54.779
- <i>La vie</i>
- Nice, solid joke.

827
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:57.490
It sucks because we could've
revisited Melody's bedroom.

828
00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:59.742
Oh, my God,
that was Melody Bostic's house.

829
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.620
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you remember that.

830
00:43:02.788 --> 00:43:06.291
Yeah, come on. Who doesn't
remember their first almost-kiss?

831
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:10.420
Evan: Hey, Olive.

832
00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:12.297
Evan, hi, what's rocking?

833
00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:13.965
Can I talk to you for a second?

834
00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:15.842
Yeah, what's up?

835
00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:18.845
Don't get mad, but Brandon told me
what you did for him.

836
00:43:19.013 --> 00:43:22.807
Oh, well, rest assured, it was equally
as thrilling for me. <i>(Purrs)</i>

837
00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:24.767
No, he told me the truth.

838
00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:28.021
I was just hoping that maybe
you could do the same for me?

839
00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:29.939
Goodbye, Evan.

840
00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.900
Wait, wait, I... I can pay you.

841
00:43:33.068 --> 00:43:35.862
I am about six seconds away
from slapping you so hard

842
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.073
- your teeth will bleed.
- Can you do it in front of everyone?

843
00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:43.369
I don't need your permission, you know.

844
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:46.831
What?

845
00:43:46.999 --> 00:43:49.626
I mean, at the rate you're going.

846
00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.961
I just don't see how people
will not believe it.

847
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:54.547
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll give you 100 bucks.

848
00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:56.132
You are repugnant.

849
00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:58.384
Uh, duh! That's the problem.

850
00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:01.012
Evan: Never mind.

851
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:04.182
I'm sorry I asked.

852
00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:13.066
I knew it wouldn't work.

853
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:14.942
I'm just a fat piece of shit.

854
00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.446
Evan: When will high school end already?

855
00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:25.870
Shit.

856
00:44:26.038 --> 00:44:30.500
I want a $100 gift card deposited
into my locker by noon tomorrow.

857
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:33.878
Preferably to the Gap, but I will
also take Amazon.com or OfficeMax.

858
00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:38.049
Actually, make it OfficeMax.
I have my eye on a label maker.

859
00:44:38.217 --> 00:44:40.843
We did not have sex, okay?

860
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.055
I let you fondle my chest,
and it was a glorious moment for you.

861
00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:47.392
Unmatched by anything you've her
to fore experienced, including cake.

862
00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:48.601
Got it?

863
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:51.729
Wait a minute.
A hundred bucks for second base?

864
00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:54.357
- Yeah.
- Doesn't that seem a little steep?

865
00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:58.236
Can we throw in, like, some
butt action or some pants rubbing?

866
00:44:58.404 --> 00:45:00.988
- What are you, 9?
- Whatever, are you in?

867
00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:05.201
- Whatever.
- Deal, then.

868
00:45:05.994 --> 00:45:07.495
Thanks, Olive.

869
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:09.288
You know, the sad thing is, Evan?

870
00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:13.918
If you'd been a gentleman
and maybe asked me on a date,

871
00:45:14.086 --> 00:45:15.294
I might've said yes.

872
00:45:15.462 --> 00:45:18.089
Really?
Do you wanna go out with me?

873
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.622
Not now I don't, shit-dick.

<i>For no apparent reason.</i>

920
00:47:46.488 --> 00:47:51.033
But, no, no.
John Hughes did not direct my life.

921
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:57.373
So instead of all that I
get to save 15 cents,

922
00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:00.376
on a bottle of Juniper Breeze
Antibacterial Gel.

How I, Olive Penderghast,
went from assumed trollop

926

to an actual home-wrecker.

927
00:48:16.768 --> 00:48:20.605
- You wanted to see me?
- I did. Why don't you come in here?

928
00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:29.155
What's going on?

929
00:48:29.948 --> 00:48:32.617
- I'm accessorizing.
- Really?

930
00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:36.329
-Uh huh.
-I think you're taking your reading
assignment a little bit too seriously.

931
00:48:36.496 --> 00:48:39.874
Well, I was really hoping
to get an A. Get it?

932
00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:42.336
- Hee Ha, ha.
- <i>(Olive giggles)</i>

933
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.295
I'm hearing some rumors.

934
00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:47.673
Well, those are true. I am considering
becoming an existentialist.

935
00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:50.426
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Jeez.

936
00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:54.889
When did teachers become
privy to idle adolescent gossip?

937
00:48:55.057 --> 00:49:00.895
That would be when everyone
is putting everything up on Facebook.

938
00:49:01.063 --> 00:49:03.481
I don't know what
your generation's fascination is

939
00:49:03.649 --> 00:49:06.025
with documenting your every thought.

940
00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:09.403
But I can assure you
they're not all diamonds.

941
00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:11.989
"Roman is having an okay day,

942
00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:16.327

at the gas station.

943
00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:17.912

Mr. Griffith: Who gives a rat's ass?

Ah, that Roman, incorrigible.

947
00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:28.047
Listen, whatever this little act
is about, I just... I'm curious.

948
00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:31.133
I really think you should consider
giving me extra credit,

949
00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:33.368
for going the extra mile.
I mean I'm really

950
00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:35.763
attempting to understand
this puritanical ostracism

951
00:49:35.931 --> 00:49:38.975
- That Hawthorne wrote about.
- You are one of the few that read the book.

952
00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:41.811
If I read one more paper
from one of your classmates

953
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:46.607
who talks about how hot she is in
the bathtub, her fake British accent,

954
00:49:46.775 --> 00:49:50.820
or, is she still married to
Ashton Kutcher, I'm gonna kill myself.

955
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:53.656
Why don't people just watch
the original movie like I did?

956
00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.658
I know you read the book.

957
00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:57.868
I did.

958
00:49:58.036 --> 00:50:01.455
Listen, I want to apologize for
sending you to the principal's office.

959
00:50:01.623 --> 00:50:04.125
Truthfully, and I'll deny it
if you say anything,

960
00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:07.044
I wanted to be cheering
with the rest of the students.

961
00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:09.714

962
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:11.632
I hate her.

963
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.842
<i>(Laughs)</i> I won't tell.

964
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.427

00:50:14.594 --> 00:50:16.721
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

966
00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:18.514
Stay golden.

967
00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:22.226
- Hi, Mrs. Griffith.
- Hi, you. How are you?

968
00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:24.729
A is for "Awesome."

969
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:26.439
Uh huh, Yeah.

970
00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:28.774
Okay, I've never seen that
girl before in my life.

971
00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:30.818
That does not surprise me.

972
00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:33.904
I know, but I'm the guidance counselor.
I should know all the students.

973
00:50:34.072 --> 00:50:36.574
Especially the ones
who dress like prostitutes.

974
00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:39.452
- It's good to see you.
- Hey, how are you? Good.

975
00:50:40.245 --> 00:50:43.914
No, stop. We're at school.
There are rules.

976
00:50:44.082 --> 00:50:46.417
- Windows.
- Yeah, yeah.

977
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.753
Do me a favor, though.
Just talk to her.

978
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.713
I think she's going through a phase.

979
00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:53.424
Oh wait is that...that's not the girl
everyone's talking about, is it?

980
00:50:53.592 --> 00:50:54.592
It is.

981
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.386
Oh, okay. Oh, this'll be good.
All right.

982
00:50:57.554 --> 00:51:00.014
You know that snotty, Jesus-freak
office aide I have

983
00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:02.141
has been bitching
about her incessantly.

984
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:06.604
They're all lies, but um, she could use
somebody to talk to anyway.

985
00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:09.356
All right. Hey, what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

986
00:51:09.524 --> 00:51:11.067
- You won't be there?
- Sorry.

987
00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:14.278
I have an after-school session.
Kid brought a knife to school.

988
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:15.738
Well, be careful, all right?

989
00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:18.365
It was a butter knife.
But you know what they say.

990
00:51:18.533 --> 00:51:20.493
You know, it's a gateway knife, so...

991
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.161
- All right, bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

992
00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:25.081
I'm thinking about another gateway.
It's a...

993
00:51:26.397 --> 00:51:27.765
Hey uh! No!

994
00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:28.959
Making spaghetti.

995
00:51:29.127 --> 00:51:31.045
- Mrs. Griffith: That's great.
- With meat.

996
00:51:31.213 --> 00:51:32.546
Mrs. Griffith:
Enjoy eating your meat.

997
00:51:32.714 --> 00:51:35.424
- And balls.
- Mrs. Griffith: Enjoy eating your balls.

998
00:51:35.702 --> 00:51:41.123
<i>♪ Trouble will find you
no matter where you go, oh, oh. ♪</i>

999
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.685
Sharpening your pencils?

1000
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:49.605
Getting them nice and sharp?

1001
00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:54.568
Hm, sharpening them up? Look at you.
Look at you. <i>(gasps)</i> So sharp.

1002
00:51:54.736 --> 00:51:57.029
Oh! Sharpening those pencils.
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

1003
00:51:57.489 --> 00:52:00.324
- Ooo, God, that's sharp. L...
- Hey, Olive. You ready to come in?

1004
00:52:03.328 --> 00:52:04.370
<i>(Mouths)</i> Good job.

1005
00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:07.123
Well, the reason I called you in
was just so we could

1006
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.167
sort of, you know, just chat
about what's going on.

1007
00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:12.962
You know, there is concern
from a few faculty members.

1008
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.630
Your husband.

1009
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:17.299
Olive, you're attempting
to make a statement.

1010
00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:20.678
I'm just a little confused
as to what exactly that is.

1011
00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:22.346
Am I in trouble?

1012
00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:24.974
Because, um, pursuant
to the student code of conduct.

1013
00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:27.810
My hemline has never been
higher than my fingertips.

1014
00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.311
No, you're not in trouble.

1015
00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:31.021
No, I just wanted to make sure you knew

1016
00:52:31.189 --> 00:52:33.566
if there's something
that you wanna talk about,

1017
00:52:33.733 --> 00:52:35.526
you know, you can trust me.

1018
00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:39.655
If I open up to you, do you promise
this stays in confidence?

1019
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:43.075
Yeah. I'm... See?
I'm the guidance counselor.

1020
00:52:43.243 --> 00:52:44.618
That's what I do.

1021
00:52:45.036 --> 00:52:47.037
I mean, I have a reputation to uphold.

1022
00:52:47.205 --> 00:52:48.372
Don't you, though?

1023
00:52:50.876 --> 00:52:54.879
All right, listen, don't tell anyone
I'm doing this, please.

1024
00:52:55.046 --> 00:52:56.172
Here you go.

1025
00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:58.215
- Here you go.
- I really don't need those.

1026
00:52:58.383 --> 00:53:01.760
Oh, you really do. Here you go.

1027
00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:03.512
Here you go. Okay?

1028
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.433
Okay, I just don't want this thing you're
going through to define your life.

1029
00:53:07.601 --> 00:53:09.310
Mrs. Griffith: Olive, do what you gotta do.
Okay?

1030
00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:13.981
Let your freak flag fly. Just make sure
you have an exit strategy.

1031
00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:18.110
Listen, Mrs. Griffith, I really...
I don't need these.

1032
00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:20.696
Well you know what?
The pill is not 100 percent effective.

1033
00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.656
Ask some of your friends' parents.

1034
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.409
Thank you for coming in.

1035
00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:30.132
Can you just send in the next person?

1036
00:53:30.133 --> 00:53:31.999
- Mm hmm.
- Thank you.

1037
00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:37.254
You're up, hoss.

1038
00:53:37.797 --> 00:53:40.341
Okay. Go, it's all right.

1039
00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:44.887
Everything's gonna be okay.

1040
00:53:51.353 --> 00:53:54.897
Don't you think it's a little strange
that your boyfriend is 22 years old

1041
00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:58.192
- and still in high school?
- Not that it's any of your business, trollop,

1042
00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.735
but he is here by choice.

1043
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:03.864
It's his choice that he's a fourth-year senior
that can't pass any test he takes at all?

1044
00:54:04.032 --> 00:54:06.367
His choice. His...His.

1045
00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:07.576
Capital H.

1046
00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:11.247
If God wanted him to graduate, God
would've given him the right answers.

1047

<i>(Stifles laughter)</i>

1048
00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:17.169
I'm sorry.
You gotta be shitting me, woman.

1049
00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:20.089
Okay. So why was he
blubbering like a baby?

1050
00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:24.760
- Is he struggling with his sexuality?
- No, you insensitive rhymes-with-witch.

1051
00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:28.055
His parents are
going through a divorce.

1052
00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:33.269
Okay, um.

1053
00:54:37.557 --> 00:54:39.557
<i>(Quietly sobs)</i>

1054
00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:44.822
You know,
sometimes our boyfriend's parents,

1055
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:46.448
they get divorced, you know?

1056
00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:50.577
And it's important to remember
it's not your fault.

1057
00:54:50.745 --> 00:54:51.787
So I gotta go.

1058
00:54:53.164 --> 00:54:57.710
But they go to our church.
What will people say?

1059
00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:06.343
How long do these embraces usually
last? Because I gotta go, but l...

1060
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:09.179
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, I'm gonna be okay.

1061
00:55:09.347 --> 00:55:11.056
Mrs. Griffith is amazing,

1062
00:55:11.224 --> 00:55:14.977
and she's gonna help Micah,
and everything's gonna be okay.

1063
00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:19.815
Yay! See? All right, that's the spirit.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1064
00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.650
Okay.

1065
00:55:26.072 --> 00:55:28.991
Wait. Why are you even
being so nice to me?

1066
00:55:31.077 --> 00:55:32.995
I did it.

1067
00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:35.922
I got through to you.

1068
00:55:36.954 --> 00:55:38.154
<i>(Squeals)</i> Yeee!

1069
00:55:38.209 --> 00:55:41.128
I'm so sorry about everything I said.
I am so, so sorry.

1070
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:45.507
I mean, I really want us to be friends.
Can we please be friends?

1071
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:47.468
Absolutely.

1072
00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:49.968

Micah is in the hospital.
He is in so much pain.

No.

I said I got it
from Olive Penderghast.

00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:42.040
I know, but what was
I supposed to say?

1104
00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:44.877
You know, and then my mom
tells Marianne's mom.

1105
00:57:45.044 --> 00:57:47.713
I did. I tried to blame it
on their divorce.

1106
00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:50.966
But my mom is not buying it.

1107
00:57:51.509 --> 00:57:53.844
That's it. I have to tell them.

1108
00:57:54.012 --> 00:57:58.015
No, I do not care that you
gave me Chlamydia. I don't!

But I don't think you're supposed to
use that language in front of a student.

Yeah, you know what else you're not
supposed to do, is sleep with them.

have to do with me?

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:30.440
This is legal. It's legal because
he's been here forever, okay?

1137
00:59:30.608 --> 00:59:33.402
He's like, he's not the sharpest
Christian in the Bible, all right?

1138
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:36.780
Mrs. Griffith: And then he finds out
that he has Chlamydia.

1139
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:39.908
And so then he's telling
everybody that it was you.

1140
00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.785
So he has to say, 'cause he didn't want
me to lose my job,

1141
00:59:41.953 --> 00:59:45.372
and he doesn't wanna get in trouble
either, so he said it's you.

1142
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.748
I'm sorry.

1143
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:50.919
But I will- I'm gonna fix it, Olive.
Okay? I'll tell everyone.

1144
00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:54.958
I'm gonna tell everyone that it's me.
Okay? I'll just... I'll lose my job.

1145
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:59.803
And, you know, whatever else I lose,
and then that's okay.

1146
01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:06.560
<i>Olive: Maybe it was becoming a habit
of mine to help the downtrodden.</i>

1147
01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.687
<i>Or maybe I just couldn't stand
to see</i>

1148
01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.772
<i> my favorite teacher's
marriage crumble.</i>

1149
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.150
<i>Either way, I decided to help.</i>

1150
01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.819
I could have Chlamydia.

1151
01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:21.450
I mean, I could have easily given it
to, Micah.

1152
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.493
I mean, who knows?

1153
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.580
Women oftentimes
don't show symptoms.

1154
01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.082
And the whole world knows
I've been whoring around.

1155
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.792
No, you haven't. No, you haven't.

1156
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.298
Because a real whore can't admit it
to herself, much less others. Trust me.

1157
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.594
Call Micah.

1158
01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:44.139
Tell him he is an ass and
he owes me so big for this, but also,

1159
01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:47.142
tell him I confessed
to giving him Chlamydia.

1160
01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:57.194
Getting a lot of hugs today.

1161
01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.322
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- Get out of here!

1162
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.202
<i>Olive: So I guess I shouldn't
be too shocked that these people.</i>

1163
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.120
<i>wanted my diseased ass
out of there.</i>

1164
01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:08.330
<i>(Protesting student)</i>
Save yourself, Olive.

1165
01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.333
<i>Olive: The funny thing is, the whole
time this all was going down,</i>

1166
01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:14.544
<i>I couldn't help but think
I could've come up with better signs.</i>

1167
01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:16.546
<i>Although you gotta love
the Quiznos guy.</i>

1168
01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:19.883
<i>That's the one thing
that trumps religion: Capitalism.</i>

1169
01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:21.468
Why are you doing this?

1170
01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.762
I'm trying to make this school
a better place.

1171
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.223
Can't you just start a petition to get
rid of all the lead paint?

1172
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.724
<i>(Quiznos guy)</i>
New Honey Chicken at Quiznos.

1173
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.143
- Not now, Quiznos.
- You're a slut.

1174
01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:31.478
You're going down, Olive.

1175
01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.981
Rhi, if this is because I'm more popular
than you, then I think what you're-

1176
01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:37.651
Let's not mistake popularity
for infamy.

1177
01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:40.696
- <i>(Student)</i>You don't wanna burn, do you?
- I'll be praying for you.

1178
01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:47.452
Sorry.

1179
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:51.581
- You okay?
- I'm awesome. I'm awesome.

1180
01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.250
Screw all these people, Olive.

1181
01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.585
Haven't you heard?

1182
01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:57.921
I already did.

1183
01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:01.091
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- What you're doing is wrong.

1184
01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.427
<i>(Students)</i> You're going to hell!

1185
01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.434
<i>Olive: So they got Rhiannon.</i>

1186
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:13.854
<i>Never underestimate the power
of extremists like, Marianne.</i>

1187
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:17.774
<i>They sense any weakness,
they pounce like jungle cats.</i>

1188
01:02:17.942 --> 01:02:20.694
<i>And the whack pack
just gets bigger and bigger.</i>

1189
01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.946
<i>But at least they have a pack.</i>

1190
01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.992
<i>I was used to being by myself,
but I had never felt more alone.</i>

1191
01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.620
<i>So I thought I should look into what they
were running around thumping about.</i>

1192
01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:33.081
- Hi, um, do you have a religion section?
- It's right over there.

1193
01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:35.250
- Can I help you with something?
- <i>The Bible.</i>

1194
01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.378
Oh, that's in bestsellers,
right next to <i>Twilight.</i>

1195
01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:42.340
<i>Olive: I didn't have time
to read the whole thing,</i>

1196
01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:44.050
<i>because it's like, 600 pages.</i>

1197
01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.719
<i>Single-spaced.</i>

1198
01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.472
<i>And as every war that's ever
been fought can tell you,</i>

1199
01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:50.640
<i>there are many ways
you can interpret it.</i>

1200
01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:53.769
<i>Except the Civil War.
That was pure racism.</i>

1201
01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.270
<i>So I went to find an expert.</i>

1202
01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:59.816
<i>But really, I just kind of
wanted someone to talk to.</i>

1203
01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.821
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1204
01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.240
I think that's how you're
suppose to start these things.

1205
01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:09.659
I'm just going off
what I've seen in movies.

1206
01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:11.870
Where do I even start?

1207
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.291
I've been pretending to be-

1208
01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.335
What is the Catholic way
of phrasing this?

1209
01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.337
A harlot?

1210
01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:25.175
A harlot, it's not that
I've actually been doing

1211
01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:29.012
the things that people, have
been saying I've been doing.

1212
01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.306
But then again,
I'm not denying them either.

1213
01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.893
So I was just wondering,
is that wrong?

1214
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.023
It's just that a lot of people,
have been asking me to do things,

1215
01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:46.363
and I thought it was okay
because it wasn't real, you know?

1216
01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:50.283
It was make-believe.

1217
01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:52.610
And no one was getting hurt, but-

1218
01:03:56.663 --> 01:03:59.180
a lot of people hate me now.

1219
01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:05.757
I kind of hate me too.

1220
01:04:11.722 --> 01:04:13.932
I might be wrong, but um-

1221
01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:16.726
aren't you supposed to say something?

1222
01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:18.937
Tell me to say 10 Hail Mary’s,
pay a fine,

1223
01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:21.606
advance token to nearest railroad?
Hello?

1224
01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:25.402
<i>Olive: Should've seen that one coming.</i>

1225
01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:35.704
<i>Luckily, I live in a town
with many different places of worship.</i>

1226
01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.415
<i>So I went to find one
with a real live human being.</i>

1227
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:39.875
Woman: Can I help you?

1228
01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.669
Yeah, I was just wondering
if there's a minister around.

1229
01:04:43.337 --> 01:04:45.297
Is it not a minister?

1230
01:04:45.464 --> 01:04:47.507
A Reverend? A wizard?

1231
01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.551
It's a pastor, and he's here.

1232
01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:52.596
How can I help you today?

1233
01:04:52.763 --> 01:04:56.099
Um, I was just wondering what your church's
stance on lying and adultery was.

1234
01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.267
It's not a good thing.

1235
01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:01.771
Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly.
But, then... Now, tell me this.

1236
01:05:01.939 --> 01:05:03.356
Assuming there is a hell.

1237
01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:06.651
Oh, the Christian Church recognizes
the existence of hell.

1238
01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:09.112
Okay, so we'll just say
there's a "hell."

1239
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.406
There is. Just so we're clear.

1240
01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:15.076
- Okay. So for argument's sake...
- No, there's no argument. It's there.

1241
01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:18.830
Right below our feet,
right above the Orient. It's there.

1242
01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:24.753
Then what would be worse,
lying or adultery?

1243
01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:28.698
Or is lying about adultery
just like double whammy? Sorry.
-Come on.

1244
01:05:30.063 --> 01:05:32.063
Olive: Ah...AHH!

1245
01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:34.137
I'm sorry young lady,
what did you say your name was?

1246
01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:38.308
I didn't. I...you know what?
I'm just gonna,

1247
01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:40.810
I'm just gonna go check out
Judaism.

1248
01:05:40.978 --> 01:05:42.979
- God. Two frames, really?
- Sorry.

1249
01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:45.273
The Jews and I have a lot in common.

1250
01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:48.193
- Just fashion-wise and stuff.
- Off you go.

1251
01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:51.404
<i>Olive: Yes, I had unwittingly sought advice
from the father</i>

1252
01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:53.657
<i>of the leader of my lynch mob.</i>

1253
01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:58.954
<i>What other complete and total idiot
can say that's happened to them?</i>

1254
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:05.251
Dill: Okay, I've narrowed it down
to The Other Boleyn Girl,

1255
01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:08.088
or The Bucket List. Huge hit.

1256
01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:11.174
Why can't we watch a movie for kids?
You always get to pick.

1257
01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:15.011
Because the Family Member
of the Week gets to pick the movie.

1258
01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:17.764
Yeah, but you get Family Member
of the Week every week.

1259
01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:19.432
And there's a reason for that.

1260
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.268
Yeah. You pick
Family Member of the Week.

1261
01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:23.937
Are you accusing me of nepotism?

1262
01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:27.649
Okay, it's The Bucket List.
This is it. This is the greatest decision.

1263
01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.944
I'm so happy with this decision.
That's what it's going to be.

1264
01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:34.072
All right, now, honey, after we watch
<i>The Bucket List,</i>

1265
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.785
remember to cross "Watch
<i>The Bucket List</i>" off our bucket list.

1266
01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:39.995
Olive: Guys.

1267
01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:45.291
I just want you to know that if you hear around
town that I have Chlamydia, that is totally false.

1268
01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:47.961
Olive, do we need
to have the talk again?

1269
01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:50.505
No, it's just a thing
that's going around.

1270
01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.550
You know, nothing you're saying
is making me feel any better.

1271
01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:56.386
Not to mention how you've been
dressing the last few days.

1272
01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.430
No judgment, but you kinda
look like a stripper.

1273
01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:01.057
- Mom.
- A high-end stripper.

1274
01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:02.851
For governors or athletes.

1275
01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.352
Dill: But stripper, nonetheless.

1276
01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.188
Oh, my God. I'm just trying
to mix it up a little.

1277
01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.149
And I have no STD's, I promise you.

1278
01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:11.776
Oh, that's great.
Daughter of the Year.

1279
01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:13.737
I'm saying if you hear
anything to the contrary,

1280
01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:16.114
come up with some funny retort
and walk away.

1281
01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:19.075
Honey, you're kind of starting
to worry us a little.

1282
01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.244
Should we be kind of
worried a little?

1283
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.246
I don't think so.

1284
01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:26.374
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1285
01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:29.419
Yeah, I got it all under control.

1286
01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:31.671
- Okay.
- Okay.

1287
01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.007
Then let's Bucket List this bitch.

1288
01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.009
<i>The Bucket List, The Bucket List.</i>

1289
01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.553
To say this whole thing
had taken over my life

1290
01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:41.181
would be a colossal understatement.

1291
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.601
<i>Olive: I actually reread The Scarlet Letter
to see how Hester dealt with it.</i>

1292
01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:49.606
<i>And it turns out she bore
her punishment in humble silence.</i>

1293
01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:52.942
Which are two concepts
I am not comfortable with.

1294
01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.320
<i>Olive: With all the mythical play
I was getting.</i>

1295
01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:58.490
<i>I still actually hadn't been
asked out on a real date.</i>

1296
01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:01.743
<i>People were jumping up and down
to say they'd slept with me,</i>

1297
01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.370
<i>but no one bothered
really trying to sleep with me.</i>

1298
01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:07.457
<i>I was starting to think I actually did
have a gnome down there.</i>

1299
01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.001
<i>- Until finally.
- Anson: Hey, Olive.</i>

1300
01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.378
Hey, Anson. What's up?

1301
01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.672
I was wondering
if you were busy tonight.

1302
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.759
Maybe wanna go out or something?

1303
01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.386
What did you have in mind?

1304
01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:23.264
I was thinking about getting
a hot-air balloon, you know.

1305
01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.141
Bringing along some champagne,

1306
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:28.645
and then possibly reading
some Sylvia Plath.

1307
01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:32.190
Or we could just go
to The Lobster Shack,

1308
01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.400
'cause it's, you know,
a little easier.

1309
01:08:34.568 --> 01:08:37.695
- I love The Lobster Shack.
- Good.

1310
01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:39.322
Okay, it's a date, then.

1311
01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:43.076
- Okay.
- Anson: Okay.

1312
01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.539
Um, so should I still bring
the Sylvia Plath or?

1313
01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:49.666
No, we could stick our heads
in the oven

1314
01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.293
- if we run out of things to talk about.
- Huh.

1315
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.670
That was...
<i>(Dismissive hiss)</i>

1316
01:08:53.838 --> 01:08:55.797
- Cool. All right. Well...
- Cool.

1317
01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:05.974
You look really beautiful.

1318
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.851
Thank you.

1319
01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.729
- You're a real gentleman.
- No.

1320
01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:16.401
Just a guy having dinner with a girl.

1321
01:09:19.995 --> 01:09:21.525
<i>(Polite laugh)</i>

1322
01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.207
Do you believe this whole thing
about lobster being an aphrodisiac?

1323
01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:33.877
I did not know it was.

1324
01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:36.504
Medical science really
has not substantiated claims

1325
01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:39.883
that any particular food increases
sexual desire or performance,

1326
01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:42.886
but guys just spend and spend
to ply women with food

1327
01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:46.556
they think is gonna get them lucky.
Which is funny, because, it's like

1328
01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:49.809
what is sexy about slurping
back oysters? Nothing.

1329
01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:53.563
Okay, did you know some people actually
eat ground-up rhinoceros horn.

1330
01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:56.774
Because it's thought to increase
the size of the male sex organ?

1331
01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.902
That's not true at all.

1332
01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:01.696
Spanish fly, spanish fly.
You've heard of this? Yes?

1333
01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.406
- Yes.
- Okay. That thing?

1334
01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.700
Pulverized blister beetle. What?

1335
01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.412
And it's illegal in the U.S. Because
if you eat just a little bit too much

1336
01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.749
it causes painful urination,
fever and bloody discharge.

1337
01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.292
- Am I talking too much?
- No.

1338
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.170
You're just burning through
a lot of topics, really fast.

1339
01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:20.173
Shouldn't have had coffee
three weeks ago.

1340
01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:21.382
I'm just kidding.

1341
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:24.781

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.681
- Yo, I'm jealous.
- Thank you.

1344
01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.726

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.245
I should start calling him
Lobster Todd.

I said hip, hip a happy,
hip, hip, a happy.

Shit.

- What? What's wrong?

1354
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.755
- Rhiannon's over there.
- So?

1355
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.174
She's been in love with you
since 1st grade.

1356
01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.885
- She's my best friend.
- I thought you two weren't speaking.

1357
01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:08.388
We're not, but that doesn't mean
she's not my best friend.

1358
01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:10.098
Or that I should be out with you.

1359
01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.642
Oh, Rhi and I don't have
anything in common.

1360
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.560
- And you and I do?
- Yeah.

1361
01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:17.814
- Like what?
- Like I hate Marianne Bryant too.

1362
01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:20.817
If that's our magical connection,
I should just date the entire school.

1363
01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.735
Haven't you?

1364
01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.489
No. No, I haven't.

1365

Happy birthday to you.

1366
01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.577
Okay, she can't see us.
Check, check, check.

1367
01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:34.038
Can you just...? Excuse me? Hi.

1368
01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:38.543
- Yo.
- I just remembered I am so allergic to shellfish.

1369
01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:41.004
I always forget that my respiratory
system will collapse and I'll die.

1370
01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:43.423
- I have a gift certificate. Keep the tip.
- Thanks.

1371
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.133
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

1372
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.052
- Go, go. Come on, come on.
- Okay.

1373
01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.804
Olive: Go, go, go.

1374
01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.856
Olive: I'm sorry about that.

1375
01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.569
I've got something for you.

Anson: Two hundred dollars
to The Home Depot.

1377
01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.399
Bam!

1378
01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:16.122
I didn't realize this was a-

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:20.043
I know it sounds kind of lame, but they
really do have some awesome stuff.

1380
01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:22.712
I bought my air compressor there.

1381
01:12:24.214 --> 01:12:26.883
So, what do we do on this date?

1382
01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.634
Whatever 200 bucks gets me.

1383
01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:34.098
- That's not really how it works.
- It's okay.

1384
01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.392
Stop.

1385
01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.228
I'm not really having sex

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:41.575
I'm saying I'm having sex
with people for money,

1387
01:12:41.576 --> 01:12:44.085
but I'm not having sex
with people for money.

1388
01:12:44.086 --> 01:12:45.193
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

1389
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.028
- Stop. No, no.
- What?

1390
01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.446
Stop!

1391
01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.199
Come on, just relax. Come on, babe.
It's all right.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:54.452
God! Asshole!

1393
01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.876
What are you doing? I paid you.

1394
01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.754
Olive: Now you didn't.

1395
01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:09.759
Anson: Come on, this is bullshit.

1396
01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:15.973
Goddamn it.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:22.230
Todd, hi.

1399
01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:30.988
- Hey, you all right?
- I just have something in my eye.

1400
01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:34.534
<i>(Sniffs)</i> Like a twig, you know, or a branch,
or a contact, or something.

- I don't, which is why I was tearing up.

1402
01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:43.835

<i>(Olive sobbing hard)</i>

1404
01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:54.637

<i>(crying)</i>

1406
01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:02.395
What's to say?
Everybody thinks I'm a whore,

1407
01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:05.773
and for the first time,
I'm starting to believe it.

1408
01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:06.983
What?

1409
01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:09.986
Don't act like you don't know
what people are saying about me.

1410
01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.989
I know what people are saying.
Doesn't mean I believe them.

1411
01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.991
- Who told you?
- No one.

1412
01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.411
No one, no one had to tell me. Once upon
a time, there was a scared little kid

1413
01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:22.415
at a party in a dark room
who was not ready for his first kiss.

1414
01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:27.044
And, you know, there was
this amazing girl who lied for him.

1415
01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:30.131
Olive: I still can't believe
you remember that.

1416
01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:36.429
You know, sometimes I pretend
you were my first real kiss.

1417
01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:39.515
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1418
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.352
- Who was?
- It was Rhiannon.

1419
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.229
- What?
- She must have told you.

1420
01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:49.609
Yeah, it was... I think it was, like,
a year after that or something.

1421
01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:52.612
It sucked, by the way.
She was, like:

1422
01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:55.031
That bitch.

1423
01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.909
Oh, my God,
she knew how I felt about you.

1424
01:14:58.076 --> 01:15:00.953
- How do you feel about me?
- And here I am feeling so bad.

1425
01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:02.330
That's just perfect.

1426
01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.874
Wait, hold on a second.
How do you feel about me?

1427
01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.792
"Felt."

1428
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.544
I said "felt."

1429
01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:13.633
Todd: Because I thought I...
I thought I heard "feel."

1430
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.426
It was "felt", all right.

1431
01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:17.637
How do you know where I live?

1432
01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:19.138
We used to carpool.

1433
01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.975
Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you
like a savant for people's addresses?

1434
01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:25.228
Just for people who I think are cool.

1435
01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.064
- You think I'm cool?
- I do.

1436
01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:31.526
And I think you're pretty and smart.

1437
01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:34.612
Did you form this opinion
prior to my little transformation?

1438
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.823
- Way prior.
- Wow.

1439
01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:39.659
Why didn't that rumor spread?

1440
01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:41.869
I like to keep my business to myself.

1441
01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:44.038
Notoriety, for whatever reason,

1442
01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.083
never seems to benefit the noted,
it's only the "notees."

1443
01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:50.419
Where were you two weeks ago?

1444
01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:56.509
Olive.

1445
01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:02.557
If I promise not to tell anyone,
could I kiss you right now?

1446
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.020
No.

1447
01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:12.275
- Okay, Okay, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1448
01:16:12.442 --> 01:16:14.569
I just mean, not like this.

1449
01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:17.613
I don't wanna kiss you with mascara
running down my face

1450
01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:20.283
and some horn dog guy
just having tried

1451
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:23.494
to stick his tongue
down my throat.

1452
01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:27.081
I've wanted to kiss you
since 8th grade,

1453
01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.418
but I want it to be perfect.

1454
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.088
And right now, my life is a mess.

1455
01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:37.842
I need to get my business in order
before I drag you into it.

1456
01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.303
What if I told you
I wanna be dragged into it?

1457
01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.847
I could help, maybe.

1458
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.873
<i>(Turns off car)</i>

1459
01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:12.793
Why now?

1460
01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.963
Why are you all of a sudden
into me now?

1461
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.256
Todd: I don't know.

1462
01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:21.135
I haven't overanalyzed it,
like you're about to.

1463
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.226
- Good night, Olive.
- Good night, Lobster Todd.

1464
01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:34.607
<i>Olive: Now that I knew there were actually
decent and goodhearted people out there</i>

1465
01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:36.359
<i>the lies had to stop.</i>

1466
01:17:36.526 --> 01:17:40.029
<i>I knew there was only one person I
could count on to set the story straight:</i>

1467
01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:41.197
<i>Brandon.</i>

1468
01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:44.617
<i>I'd helped him, and even though
it would destroy his new reputation</i>

1469
01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:47.328
<i>as a straight stud,
I knew he'd help me.</i>

1470
01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.122
Oh, my God. Did you hear that
Brandon ran away from home?

1471
01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.709
Yeah, totally. He left his parents
a note that said, "I'm gay, bitches",

1472
01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:57.046
and then he skipped town
with some big, hulking black guy.

1473
01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.840
My apologies to Mark Twain.

1474
01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:01.092
- Wait, huh?
- What?

1475
01:18:01.259 --> 01:18:03.219
- You said something.
- You said something.

1476
01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:05.262
We were talking and you said something
so then I came back.

1477
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.889
- You're funny. Okay.
- Call me.

1478
01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:10.226
<i>Olive: I went to everyone I'd helped
and begged them to say it wasn't true.</i>

1479
01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:12.561
No way. I gave you money.

1480
01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:16.357
Olive: You gave me a gift card to AutoZone.
I don't even have a car.

1481
01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.317
I thought it'd be aspirational.

1482
01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:22.697
Evan, please do this for me, all right?
I did that for you. Do this for me.

1483
01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:25.783
I don't want people to know
I didn't go to second base with you.

1484
01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.953
Do you know how many girls
I've hooked up with because of that?

1485
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.663
Wow, girls are almost as dumb as boys.

1486
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:34.416
Oh, yes, they are.
<i>(whispers)</i> Cha, ching.

1487
01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.421
<i>Olive: It gets worse.</i>

1488
01:18:38.588 --> 01:18:40.214
Micah: "Honor your father
and your mother."

1489
01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:43.801
<i>Olive: Due to his condition, Micah was
sent on a visit to his grandparents,</i>

1490
01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.428
<i>in Palatka, Florida.</i>

1491
01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:48.764
<i>And if there's one thing worse
than Chlamydia, it's Florida.</i>

1492
01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:50.725
"...be guilty of adultery."

1493
01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.935
Get your hands out
of your berries, boy.

1494
01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:55.104
Mrs. Griffith: Olive, life
is full of choices.

1495
01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:58.524
I made a bad one.
But then, so did you.

1496
01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:02.027
Mrs. Griffith: But I see no other alternative
than to just live with the guilt.

1497
01:19:02.195 --> 01:19:05.531
My guilt stems from my indiscretion
and yours for lying.

1498
01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:09.827
We made our choices.
Now, we just have to let it ride.

1499
01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:14.290
Or I could just tell everyone the truth
and get you fired and put in jail.

1500
01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:17.084
First of all, he is of age, okay?

1501
01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.462
It's perfectly legal
in the state of California.

1502
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:22.214
I checked. He is 21 in eight months.

1503
01:19:22.382 --> 01:19:25.301
And secondly, let's play the Who
Would You Believe game, okay?

1504
01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:28.846
Why don't you ask yourself, if you
were an adult, who would you believe, huh?

1505
01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:31.098
Who would you believe?
Who would you believe?

1506
01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.434
<i>(Shouts)</i> Who would you believe? Who?

1507
01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.357
Thank you for coming in.

1508
01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:48.073
<i>Olive: Yeah, Mrs. Griffith was pure evil, but
I still shouldn't have done what I did.</i>

1509
01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:51.035
Your wife has Chlamydia,
and she's sleeping with a student,

1510
01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.829
and she gave it to him,
and she's trying to blame me.

1511
01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:56.707
What?

1512
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:06.509
I'm sorry.

1513
01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.762
Olive: Mr. Griffith,
if you ever see this,

1514
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:15.851
just know that I was wrong
to tell you that in that way. At all.

1515
01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:18.062
I shouldn't have done it.

1516
01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:21.190
<i>Olive: And I don't even feel bad
for lying for your wife.</i>

1517
01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:26.862
<i>But I hate myself for telling you
the truth. I am so sorry.</i>

1518
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:31.158
<i>With my words, even though
they were true, I ended a marriage.</i>

1519
01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:35.788
<i>Looking back, that's the thing
I regret the most.</i>

1520
01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:47.633
Olive: So now everyone that knows the truth
is either gone or they won't fess up.

1521
01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:52.805
And Marianne Bryant and her
disciples are demanding my head.

1522
01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:56.559
The messed-up thing is I would not put
it past Principal Gibbons to expel me.

1523
01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.894
I had a similar situation
when I was your age.

1524
01:20:59.062 --> 01:21:00.729
What? Everyone called you a slut?

1525
01:21:00.897 --> 01:21:03.983
I had a horrible reputation and
people said awful things about me.

1526
01:21:04.484 --> 01:21:06.402
- Why?
- Because I was a slut.

1527
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:10.990
I slept with a whole bunch of people.
A slew, a heap, a peck. Mostly guys.

1528
01:21:11.157 --> 01:21:13.450
- Mom.
- Sorry, I got around.

1529
01:21:13.618 --> 01:21:16.620
Before I met Dad,
I had incredibly low self-worth.

1530
01:21:16.788 --> 01:21:20.374
Do me a favor and just stuff this down
my throat until I asphyxiate to death.

1531
01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.043
- It's true. It is.
- I want to die. <i>(Gags)</i>

1532
01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:25.546
It's true.
I was quite the contortionist.

1533
01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.757
I could do this thing. I could go...
I mean, my leg all the way...

1534
01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:31.218
Stop. Can you stop?
Don't show me.

1535
01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:34.471
- Can you not see that I'm a mess?
- No, you're not, Olive.

1536
01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.390
You're wonderful.

1537
01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:39.101
And you'll handle this
the same way I did.

1538
01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.729
With an incontrovertible
sense of humor.

1539
01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:45.441
But you're much smarter than I am.

1540
01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.694
So you'll come out of this
much better than I did.

1541
01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:52.615
Thank you, Mom.

1542
01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:58.454
- Rosemary: I could get my leg so far back.
- Olive: No, no, no. Stop it.

1543
01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:01.457
<i>Olive: So it was time to put an end
to all this once and for all.</i>

1544
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.250
<i>By telling my side of the story.</i>

1545
01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.544
<i>And that's why I decided
to do this web cast.</i>

1546
01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:09.218
So here we go.
<i>(Clears throat)</i>

1547
01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.300
Part five.

1548
01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.594
Not with a fizzle, but with a bang.

young lady? Get to my office right now.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:28.687
You know, I can't, because I have a date with
the guy I like and the rest of the school.

1581
01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:32.066
I think that before you expel me,
you might wanna talk to Mrs. Griffith,

1582
01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.943

talk you into letting me stay.

enough of you. Figuratively speaking.

1602
01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.382
I know. I spent a minute on it.

1603
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.551
I'll be right down.

- Chip: Hmm?

I don't know when it'll happen.

1608
01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:59.361
You know, it might be five minutes
from now or tonight,

1609
01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:03.448
or six months from now
or maybe on our wedding night.

1610
01:26:03.616 --> 01:26:08.495
But the really amazing thing is,
it is nobody's goddamn business.

1611
01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:12.249
Come on, where's she going?

1612
01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.626
