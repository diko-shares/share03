00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:55.815
<i>The rumors of my promiscuity</i>
<i>have been greatly exaggerated.</i>

2
00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:59.777
<i>I used to be anonymous,</i>
<i>invisible to the opposite sex.</i>

3
00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:01.737
<i>If Google Earth were a guy...</i>

4
00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:04.949
<i>... he couldn't find me if I was</i>
<i>dressed up as a 10-story building.</i>

5
00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:08.828
<i>Pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh?</i>
<i>A high school girl feeling anonymous.</i>

6
00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:12.456
<i>Who am I? What does it all mean?</i>
<i>Why am I here? Blah.</i>

7
00:01:12.624 --> 00:01:15.876
<i>But don't worry,</i>
<i>this isn't one of those tales.</i>

8
00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:18.004
<i>Though it sure started out that way.</i>

9
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:20.881
<i>And then it changed pretty quickly</i>
<i>when I started lying...</i>

10
00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.676
<i>... about some very personal things.</i>

11
00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:27.638
<i>So let the record show that I,</i>
<i>Olive Penderghast...</i>

12
00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:32.560
<i>... being of sound mind,</i>
<i>and below-average breast size...</i>

13
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.895
<i>... swear to tell the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth...</i>

14
00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:38.149
<i>... and nothing but the truth.</i>
<i>Starting now.</i>

15
00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:41.402
<i>And what better way</i>
<i>to share my private thoughts...</i>

16
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.487
<i>... than to broadcast them</i>
<i>on the Internet?</i>

17
00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.991
So here it is. Part one.

18
00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:52.163
The shudder-inducing and cliched,
however totally false account...

19
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:56.542
...of how I lost my virginity
to a guy at a community college.

20
00:01:57.085 --> 00:02:01.547
Let me just begin by saying
that there are two sides to every story.

21
00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:04.634
And this is my side, the right one.

22
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:06.552
George is not a sexy name.

23
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.638
George is what you name
your teddy bear...

24
00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:11.140
...not the name you wanna
scream out during climax.

25
00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:14.060
And by that, I assume you mean?

26
00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:16.771
The stable and self-perpetuating
end stage...

27
00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:18.814
...in the evolution
of a plant community.

28
00:02:18.982 --> 00:02:20.650
- Right.
- Why, what were you thinking?

29
00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:24.737
The same. But I don't say it out loud
lest someone get the wrong idea.

30
00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:27.823
I think you know innuendo
is attached to everything these days.

31
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.034
Innuendo? What...?
Whatever do you mean?

32
00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:33.704
Rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books.
They don't hit back.

33
00:02:33.872 --> 00:02:38.417
Also, hugs not drugs.
Mess with the bull, get the horns.

34
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:41.170
And any other cliches
you can come up with.

35
00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.798
Bye, Mr. Griffith.

36
00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:45.257
Bye.

37
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:47.885
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

38
00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.388
<i>Mr. Griffith is my favorite teacher.</i>

39
00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.515
<i>Although,</i>
<i>after all the trouble I caused...</i>

40
00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:54.934
<i>... I don't know if I'm still</i>
<i>his favorite student.</i>

41
00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:56.560
You know, these are bad for you.

42
00:02:56.728 --> 00:03:00.231
It leads to unwanted pregnancy,
all sorts of things.

43
00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:04.235
Mismatched tires on your vehicle,
which is nonexistent.

44
00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:08.698
<i>And here is where the trouble began.</i>
<i>The lie that started the whole thing.</i>

45
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:12.743
Please, please, I'm begging you.
I will pay you. I'll pay you.

46
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.745
Rhi, I cannot go camping
with you, okay?

47
00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:16.622
I'm sorry, but I have a date.

48
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.417
- Okay? I told you.
- With who?

49
00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:22.920
- You don't know him.
- And neither do you, you selfish bitch.

50
00:03:23.088 --> 00:03:25.423
Yes, I do.
He goes to college with my brother.

51
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.174
Okay. What's his name, then?

52
00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.177
<i>Rhiannon is what you'd call</i>
<i>a strong personality.</i>

53
00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:32.638
<i>She asked me to come camping</i>
<i>with her family...</i>

54
00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:34.724
<i>... and I don't know why</i>
<i>I didn't wanna go.</i>

55
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:38.102
<i>A little because I didn't feel like</i>
<i>hanging out with her all weekend.</i>

56
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.605
<i>But mostly because her parents are</i>
<i>the weirdest people I have ever met...</i>

57
00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:44.066
<i>... and I live in California.</i>

58
00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:46.777
<i>I ate dinner at her house once</i>
<i>and I swore, never again.</i>

59
00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:49.238
- This is interesting.
- Patchouli burger.

60
00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:51.490
We grew it in our victory garden.

61
00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:53.117
You want some dessert?

62
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:55.745
No, thank you.
I'm trying to watch my figure.

63
00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.705
Well, I'm not.

64
00:03:58.832 --> 00:04:00.666
<i>So I lied and told her I couldn't go...</i>

65
00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.919
<i>... because I had a date with a friend</i>
<i>of my brother's named George.</i>

66
00:04:04.087 --> 00:04:07.173
Let's just face it, there is no such thing
as a sexy George.

67
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.758
Yeah, well, mine is...

68
00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:12.428
...so I think we should just
put this conversation to bed.

69
00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:16.348
Fine, don't go camping with us.
Just know I hate you, bitch.

70
00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:18.851
Go get your chocolate milk.

71
00:04:19.978 --> 00:04:22.146
- Do you want one?
- No.

72
00:04:22.314 --> 00:04:24.940
<i>And here's how I really spent</i>
<i>the weekend.</i>

73
00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:35.951
That's the worst song ever.

74
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.876
<i>But on Monday, when Rhi asked me</i>
<i>how my weekend was...</i>

75
00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:28.712
He was charming, you know?
He was a real gentleman.

76
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.132
And it feels like I got a love
and I know that it's all mine.

77
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.052
Okay, okay. Wait, wait.
So are you going to see him again?

78
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.514
No. No, probably not. You know,
it was just one of those weekends.

79
00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:40.266
A whole weekend?

80
00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:41.934
Yup.

81
00:05:42.394 --> 00:05:45.062
- Wait a minute. You didn't have...?
- What?

82
00:05:45.397 --> 00:05:47.231
No. No, of course not.

83
00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.568
You liar.
You totally lost your V-card to him.

84
00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:52.361
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

85
00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.072
- Tell me everything.
- Rhi, I'm not that kind of girl.

86
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.575
The kind that does it,
or the kind that does it...

87
00:05:57.742 --> 00:06:00.077
...and doesn't have the balls
to tell her friend?

88
00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:01.912
- What?
- I want every detail.

89
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.414
- Rhi.
- Now, bitch.

90
00:06:03.582 --> 00:06:05.499
You know, you call me "bitch" a lot.
Okay?

91
00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:08.794
- It's not a term of endearment.
- I want every detail. Now, shitface.

92
00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:10.921
You're not heading
in the right direction.

93
00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.506
Tell me.

94
00:06:12.674 --> 00:06:14.258
Fine.

95
00:06:15.176 --> 00:06:16.802
We did it.

96
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.095
Yes!

97
00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.556
Finally.
Now you're a super slut like me.

98
00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:23.183
I don't think letting Peter Hedlund
motorboat you...

99
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.437
...behind a Bed Bath & Beyond
really makes you a super slut.

100
00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:29.899
There were a lot of people walking
past. Someone could've easily seen.

101
00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:33.777
Whatever. This isn't about me,
this is about you.

102
00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:34.987
What'd you let him do?

103
00:06:35.697 --> 00:06:40.075
It was normal. You know?
Nothing freaky.

104
00:06:40.243 --> 00:06:42.494
<i>I don't know why I did it.</i>

105
00:06:42.662 --> 00:06:45.122
<i>I guess maybe it was because</i>
<i>it was the first time...</i>

106
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.750
<i>... I had sort of felt superior to Rhi.</i>

107
00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:51.295
<i>But I just started piling on lie after lie.</i>
<i>It was like setting up Jenga.</i>

108
00:06:51.463 --> 00:06:52.963
Do you know, like, Glade candles?

109
00:06:53.131 --> 00:06:56.467
Those kind, but they were, like,
sexy Glade candles.

110
00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:59.345
- He was sweet. He was...
- Of course.

111
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:06.727
What the hell are you looking at,
Sister Christian?

112
00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:09.271
Just a couple of admitted whores.

113
00:07:11.524 --> 00:07:14.360
<i>Marianne Bryant is the secretary</i>
<i>of the student council...</i>

114
00:07:14.527 --> 00:07:16.946
<i>... chairman of the Orange Blossom</i>
<i>dance committee...</i>

115
00:07:17.113 --> 00:07:19.323
<i>... and president of</i>
<i>the Cross Your Heart Club...</i>

116
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.534
<i>... a club dedicated to shoving</i>
<i>their beliefs down people's throats.</i>

117
00:07:22.702 --> 00:07:24.161
Obviously they don't care.

118
00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:27.289
<i>Last year's cause celebre was</i>
<i>the changing of the school mascot.</i>

119
00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:31.543
Give it up for your Blue Devils!

120
00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:33.712
Blue!

121
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.256
Blue Devil!

122
00:07:38.677 --> 00:07:40.177
Yeah.

123
00:07:40.804 --> 00:07:43.180
Yeah!

124
00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:47.267
How can we exhibit school pride
when we're conveyed to others...

125
00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:49.061
...as Satan worshippers?

126
00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:52.690
<i>Now, thankfully,</i>
<i>we're the much less intimidating...</i>

127
00:07:54.025 --> 00:07:56.026
Give it up for the Woodchucks!

128
00:07:56.194 --> 00:07:58.487
Hey! Go, Woodchucks!

129
00:07:58.655 --> 00:08:00.948
Woodchucks!

130
00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:09.581
I liked Todd much better
when he was topless.

131
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:12.918
Yeah, but even dressed as a
woodchuck, I still fantasize about him.

132
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:14.712
Woodchucks.

133
00:08:17.424 --> 00:08:19.550
<i>Now Marianne had</i>
<i>a new cause celebre.</i>

134
00:08:20.135 --> 00:08:21.218
<i>Me.</i>

135
00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:23.846
Which brings us to part two.

136
00:08:24.014 --> 00:08:27.766
The accelerated velocity
of terminological inexactitude.

137
00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:32.604
<i>Which is really just my obnoxious way</i>
<i>of saying that lies travel fast.</i>

138
00:08:32.772 --> 00:08:37.401
<i>And, boy, did my terminological</i>
<i>inexactitude accelerate with velocity.</i>

139
00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:39.445
Did you hear about Olive?

140
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.134
No way.

141
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.603
- She's not a virgin anymore?
- I can't believe it.

142
00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:14.605
- Olive lost her virginity.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:15.857 --> 00:09:18.942
Maybe next time a certain somebody
will be a little more careful...

144
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.819
...what she says in the water closet.

145
00:09:20.987 --> 00:09:24.114
Yeah, about that? It's...
That's actually not what you think.

146
00:09:24.282 --> 00:09:26.450
Can I talk to you alone
for a second?

147
00:09:26.618 --> 00:09:29.745
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

148
00:09:31.581 --> 00:09:33.665
Bye, Nina.

149
00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:38.670
What you heard in the bathroom
the other day wasn't true at all.

150
00:09:38.838 --> 00:09:42.299
- It's actually a funny story.
- Olive. That's your name, right?

151
00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:45.803
Yeah, yeah. And you're Marianne.

152
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.347
We've had nine classes together
since kindergarten.

153
00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:51.517
Ten, if you count Religion
of Other Cultures, which you didn't...

154
00:09:51.684 --> 00:09:53.644
...because you refused to go.

155
00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:56.480
Yeah. Listen, I'm not the one
that you have to answer to...

156
00:09:56.648 --> 00:09:58.065
...for your depraved behavior.

157
00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:01.110
There's a higher power
that will judge you for your indecency.

158
00:10:01.277 --> 00:10:03.153
Tom Cruise?

159
00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:05.739
I hope for your sake
that God has a sense of humor.

160
00:10:05.907 --> 00:10:09.535
Oh, I have 17 years' worth
of anecdotal proof he does.

161
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.620
You've made your bed.

162
00:10:11.788 --> 00:10:14.456
I just hope for your sake
that you've cleaned the sheets.

163
00:10:16.376 --> 00:10:18.168
- Did I just get saved?
- I missed you.

164
00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:19.503
Oh, you too.

165
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:22.047
<i>So Marianne spread the rumor.</i>

166
00:10:22.215 --> 00:10:25.551
<i>For the first time ever, my sexual</i>
<i>exploits were the talk of the school.</i>

167
00:10:25.718 --> 00:10:28.178
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm wrong.</i>
<i>It was the second time.</i>

168
00:10:28.346 --> 00:10:30.347
<i>The first time was back</i>
<i>in 8th grade...</i>

169
00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:34.184
<i>... when all I wanted was a kiss from</i>
<i>this guy I had always had a crush on.</i>

170
00:10:34.352 --> 00:10:37.604
<i>Todd and I were thrown together</i>
<i>in Seven Minutes of Heaven.</i>

171
00:10:37.772 --> 00:10:42.442
<i>Luckily we had a super romantic</i>
<i>song from our youth to set the mood.</i>

172
00:10:44.237 --> 00:10:45.529
I think this is the part...

173
00:10:45.697 --> 00:10:48.365
...where you're supposed to
stick your tongue in my mouth.

174
00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:50.075
That's what I've heard, anyway.

175
00:10:50.243 --> 00:10:52.452
Just give me a second, okay?

176
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.372
According to my watch,
you have 382 of them.

177
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.790
- How do you do that?
- What?

178
00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.251
Add so fast.
And you also talk like a grown-up.

179
00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:02.713
Don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart
as I think I am.

180
00:11:04.048 --> 00:11:08.719
So if we didn't do anything,
could you still tell people we kissed?

181
00:11:11.556 --> 00:11:13.015
Absolutely.

182
00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:15.350
- Thanks, Olive.
- Sure, Todd.

183
00:11:16.603 --> 00:11:18.395
<i>I actually didn't wanna lie that time.</i>

184
00:11:18.563 --> 00:11:21.190
<i>When people thought</i>
<i>I'd kissed someone, they didn't care.</i>

185
00:11:21.357 --> 00:11:23.442
<i>But when they thought</i>
<i>I slept with someone...</i>

186
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.069
Hey, Olive. How's it going?

187
00:11:26.237 --> 00:11:28.906
I'm swell,
Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before.

188
00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:30.991
Thanks for asking.

189
00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:36.413
<i>All I could think to myself was,</i>
<i>"Great, now I'm a tramp."</i>

190
00:11:36.581 --> 00:11:38.582
<i>I'm gonna have to get</i>
<i>a lower-back tattoo...</i>

191
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.043
<i>... and pierce something</i>
<i>not on my face.</i>

192
00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:43.712
You guys know that
I was here all weekend, right?

193
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.297
- Yeah.
- Yes, you were upstairs.

194
00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:47.007
- Yeah.
- You would testify to that?

195
00:11:47.175 --> 00:11:49.134
- Yeah.
- I would take a bullet for you.

196
00:11:49.302 --> 00:11:51.053
You know that.
Right between the eyes.

197
00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:53.513
Man, I would slit my throat...

198
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:55.599
...rather than say something
to someone...

199
00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:58.435
...that you didn't want me to say.
- That's not necessary.

200
00:11:58.603 --> 00:12:01.396
- But that is comforting.
- That's how I am, how I roll.

201
00:12:01.564 --> 00:12:03.315
That's how I do, as they say.

202
00:12:03.483 --> 00:12:07.027
- I like the pants.
- Thank you. They're Costco.

203
00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:09.071
You can have them
when you get taller.

204
00:12:09.239 --> 00:12:11.740
- I'm never gonna go through puberty.
- Course you will.

205
00:12:11.908 --> 00:12:13.784
But we're a family of late bloomers.

206
00:12:13.952 --> 00:12:16.703
I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive.

207
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:18.789
Why does that matter? I'm adopted.

208
00:12:19.207 --> 00:12:22.668
What? Oh, my God. Who told you?

209
00:12:23.127 --> 00:12:26.213
Guys, we were gonna do this
at the right time.

210
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:27.422
Listen to me.

211
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.717
Sometimes, even when a man and
a woman love each other very much...

212
00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:32.552
...like your mother and I used to...

213
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.430
...their insides just don't cooperate
with each other.

214
00:12:35.598 --> 00:12:36.848
So, what's going on, honey?

215
00:12:37.016 --> 00:12:40.143
Why do you want us to take a bullet
if anyone asks if you were here?

216
00:12:40.311 --> 00:12:42.646
It's nothing. It's just the rumor mill.

217
00:12:42.814 --> 00:12:45.983
What's the rumor mill churning out
these days? Anything interesting?

218
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.194
You know, not really. Not really.
It's a little low on grist.

219
00:12:49.362 --> 00:12:52.155
Clever wordplay. I like it.
You must be related to me.

220
00:12:52.323 --> 00:12:54.491
- Only by marriage.
- Give it to me.

221
00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:56.994
So, what we're all gonna take away
from this:

222
00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:59.871
- I was here all weekend, right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

223
00:13:00.748 --> 00:13:03.333
<i>Remember how I told you</i>
<i>Google Earth couldn't find me...</i>

224
00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:05.627
<i>... if I was dressed up</i>
<i>as a ten-story building?</i>

225
00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:09.589
<i>Well, the next day it could find me if I
<i>was dressed as a crack on a sidewalk.</i>

226
00:13:09.757 --> 00:13:12.009
<i>That's the beauty of being</i>
<i>a girl in high school.</i>

227
00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:15.679
<i>People hear you had sex once</i>
<i>and, bam, you're a bimbo.</i>

228
00:13:15.847 --> 00:13:18.390
<i>I really didn't mean for the lie</i>
<i>to put me on the map...</i>

229
00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:21.727
<i>... but I gotta admit,</i>
<i>I kind of liked being on the map.</i>

230
00:13:21.894 --> 00:13:26.148
So, clearly Nathaniel Hawthorne
is a complex writer.

231
00:13:26.316 --> 00:13:27.941
Even I had trouble with him.

232
00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:31.194
I read him originally when I was 5,
but I struggled.

233
00:13:31.362 --> 00:13:34.323
So I'm gonna break it down for you.
I'm gonna throw some rhymes.

234
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.491
Anson, drop me a beat.

235
00:13:36.659 --> 00:13:38.368
- What?
- Give me a beat.

236
00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:40.412
Push it up.

237
00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.166
<i>Yeah, adultery, vengeance</i>

238
00:13:44.334 --> 00:13:46.668
<i>Crimes of passion</i>

239
00:13:46.836 --> 00:13:48.879
Kill the beat.
I'm not gonna rap for you.

240
00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:51.089
It's pandering
and it's been done before...

241
00:13:51.257 --> 00:13:54.384
...in every bad movie
you've ever seen. Okay.

242
00:13:54.552 --> 00:13:57.179
<i>Ironically, we were studying</i>
The Scarlet Letter.

243
00:13:57.347 --> 00:13:59.222
<i>Now, isn't that always the way?</i>

244
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.559
<i>The books you read in class always</i>
<i>have some strong connection...</i>

245
00:14:02.727 --> 00:14:05.562
<i>... with whatever angsty</i>
<i>adolescent drama is going on.</i>

246
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.690
Except for Huckleberry Finn.
<i>I don't know any teenage boys...</i>

247
00:14:08.858 --> 00:14:11.443
<i>... who have ever run away</i>
<i>with a big, hulking black guy.</i>

248
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:14.071
For those who haven't read
<i>The Scarlet Letter...</i>

249
00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:17.908
...or for those who said you did
but didn't, here's all you need to know.

250
00:14:18.076 --> 00:14:20.911
<i>This girl, Hester Prynne,</i>
<i>has an affair with a minister...</i>

251
00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:24.915
<i>... is besmirched and made to wear</i>
<i>a red A for "adulterer."</i>

252
00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:27.376
<i>The town realizes</i>
<i>she was too harshly judged...</i>

253
00:14:27.543 --> 00:14:30.420
<i>... and she's really a good person,</i>
<i>and she dies a saint.</i>

254
00:14:30.588 --> 00:14:32.422
<i>A whole bunch</i>
<i>of other stuff happens too.</i>

255
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.134
If you have a test on it, rent the movie,
but make sure it's the original...

256
00:14:36.302 --> 00:14:39.930
...not the Demi Moore version where
she talks in a fake British accent...

257
00:14:40.098 --> 00:14:41.848
...and takes a lot of baths.

258
00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:46.937
To say that one was freely adapted
is a bit of an understatement, guvnor.

259
00:14:47.105 --> 00:14:49.106
What we have to realize...

260
00:14:49.273 --> 00:14:52.567
...is that Hester lived
in an entirely different time.

261
00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:58.949
A time when the worst crime a woman
could commit was in fact adultery.

262
00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:00.784
Nina.

263
00:15:00.952 --> 00:15:02.911
I think Hester Prynne was...

264
00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:05.622
Excuse my language... . A skank.

265
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.250
A skank? So you don't think
she was a victim at all?

266
00:15:08.418 --> 00:15:10.627
Why should I?
She brought it on herself.

267
00:15:11.963 --> 00:15:16.466
Perhaps you should embroider a red A
on your wardrobe, abominable tramp.

268
00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:20.470
Perhaps you should get a wardrobe,
you abominable twat.

269
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.641
<i>Not my best line,</i>
<i>but it was provocative enough...</i>

270
00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:27.310
<i>... to land me in the principal's office.</i>

271
00:15:32.859 --> 00:15:37.154
Seems as if someone's
on a downward spiral.

272
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.866
Seems as if someone's
practicing the mundane activities...

273
00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:43.201
...she'll be saddled with
the rest of her life.

274
00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:46.163
I hope you at least had the good sense
to use protection.

275
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.789
Why? Your parents didn't.

276
00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:50.667
- You're going to hell.
- Just as long as you won't be there.

277
00:15:50.835 --> 00:15:52.669
I can assure you I won't.

278
00:15:53.254 --> 00:15:55.172
Good.

279
00:15:59.677 --> 00:16:03.555
I don't care who started it.
Just work it out.

280
00:16:08.144 --> 00:16:09.186
Penderghast.

281
00:16:10.688 --> 00:16:13.398
So why am I just meeting you?

282
00:16:13.566 --> 00:16:16.151
Language like this would've
warranted a visit years ago.

283
00:16:16.319 --> 00:16:20.363
This is the first time I've done anything
remotely misbehavioral.

284
00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:21.656
This is foul.

285
00:16:21.824 --> 00:16:24.075
I know. I am so...
I'm really, really sorry.

286
00:16:24.243 --> 00:16:26.536
Sorry you said it
or sorry you got caught?

287
00:16:26.704 --> 00:16:28.663
Sorry I said it, honestly.

288
00:16:28.831 --> 00:16:32.459
And sorry I got caught a little bit too,
but mostly just sorry I said it.

289
00:16:32.627 --> 00:16:36.546
If you use a word like this again in my
school, it'll be your last. Understand?

290
00:16:36.714 --> 00:16:37.756
Yes, sir. Yes.

291
00:16:37.924 --> 00:16:40.383
I mean, this isn't one of
those progressive schools...

292
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:43.053
...where teachers are called
by their first names...

293
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:45.847
...and students
are partners in learning...

294
00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:48.975
...and there's a fundraising auction
at the end of the year...

295
00:16:49.143 --> 00:16:52.395
...where the more creative parents
put on musical skits...

296
00:16:52.563 --> 00:16:54.564
...about the community garden.

297
00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:57.442
This is public school.

298
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.030
If I can keep the girls off the pole and
the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.

299
00:17:02.198 --> 00:17:04.741
Now, if you're sent to me
one more time...

300
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:08.286
...you're gonna be out on your fantail.
Now, am I making myself clear?

301
00:17:08.454 --> 00:17:09.579
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:11.540
- Good.
- I think so.

303
00:17:11.707 --> 00:17:15.627
I mean, I got a little lost in the middle,
but I found my way back.

304
00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:17.587
Detention after school tomorrow.

305
00:17:17.755 --> 00:17:20.757
Now, out.

306
00:17:22.426 --> 00:17:26.471
<i>Even though it was my slutty alter ego</i>
<i>that said a bad word in school...</i>

307
00:17:26.639 --> 00:17:28.890
<i>... it was my ass that got in trouble...</i>

308
00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:32.060
<i>... which was a place my ass</i>
<i>had never been before.</i>

309
00:17:37.108 --> 00:17:38.692
Hey, Olive.

310
00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:41.653
Oh, my God. The illusion is shattered.

311
00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:45.282
They put you in the gas chamber if you
take your head off at Disney World.

312
00:17:45.449 --> 00:17:48.118
I think they just fire you.
You're thinking of Disneyland.

313
00:17:48.286 --> 00:17:50.120
- Disney World is more liberal.
- Oh, yeah.

314
00:17:50.288 --> 00:17:53.164
I always forget Disney World
went blue in the last election.

315
00:17:53.332 --> 00:17:55.208
Are you going
to Melody Bostic's party?

316
00:17:55.459 --> 00:17:56.960
I hadn't planned on it.

317
00:17:57.128 --> 00:18:00.171
Me neither. My cousin's getting
married. It's a rehearsal dinner.

318
00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:02.966
See you. Stay excellent.

319
00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:04.467
You too.

320
00:18:04.635 --> 00:18:05.927
- What's up, kid?
- Woodchuck.

321
00:18:07.555 --> 00:18:09.431
Please tell me the rumors are true.

322
00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:12.058
Yes. Yes. I am a big, fat slut.

323
00:18:12.226 --> 00:18:15.687
No, the one where you got suspended
for calling Nina Howell a dick...

324
00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:17.939
...and punching her in the left tit.

325
00:18:18.649 --> 00:18:21.610
I worry about the way information
circulates at this school.

326
00:18:22.278 --> 00:18:24.946
Rhi? I need to tell you something.

327
00:18:25.114 --> 00:18:27.991
Like the exact moment
you turned into such a badass?

328
00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:29.993
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Okay.

329
00:18:30.161 --> 00:18:32.829
Tell me you left a mark
on that scrunched-up face of hers?

330
00:18:32.997 --> 00:18:34.831
- It's not true.
- It wasn't the left tit?

331
00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:37.834
It was the right one.
I always pegged you for a southpaw.

332
00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:40.587
Can you listen to me
for one second, please?

333
00:18:40.755 --> 00:18:43.965
Okay. It didn't happen.

334
00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:48.011
Oh, yeah, right. Your secret's safe
with me, you little sex monkey.

335
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.643
I got sent to the principal today.

336
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.895
Did you win a medal or something?

337
00:18:57.063 --> 00:18:58.104
Not exactly.

338
00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:02.859
I used inappropriate language
in English class.

339
00:19:03.027 --> 00:19:06.029
Although we're reading a book
that I personally deem...

340
00:19:06.197 --> 00:19:10.033
...inappropriate for our age group,
so I actually felt it was quite apropos.

341
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:11.451
What did you say?

342
00:19:13.496 --> 00:19:15.705
Let's just say
it was an inappropriate word.

343
00:19:15.873 --> 00:19:17.207
Well, what did it start with?

344
00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:19.751
A snide comment
from a snotty girl in my class.

345
00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:23.296
No, I mean what letter
did the word start with?

346
00:19:23.464 --> 00:19:25.090
<i>- T.</i>
- Oh, T.

347
00:19:25.257 --> 00:19:29.719
- T? Let us think. T, T, T.
- T. All right, T. Yeah, T.

348
00:19:29.887 --> 00:19:34.224
- T, T, T.
- T, T, T.

349
00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:47.237
- Guys.
- Noun, adjective or verb?

350
00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:50.532
Noun. It's definitely slang.
Think British.

351
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.575
Tallywhacker? Termagant?

352
00:19:56.247 --> 00:19:58.331
You're just saying sounds.
Those are sounds.

353
00:19:58.499 --> 00:20:01.418
- Spell it with your peas.
- Yeah, spell it with your peas. Do it.

354
00:20:01.585 --> 00:20:03.253
- I will take that challenge.
- Do it.

355
00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:04.754
I like that. All right.

356
00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:07.215
So does this have anything to do
with the rumor...

357
00:20:07.383 --> 00:20:09.426
...that you mentioned the other night?

358
00:20:09.593 --> 00:20:12.887
Do you need to talk to us
about something, sweetie?

359
00:20:13.055 --> 00:20:15.014
What's a twit?

360
00:20:15.182 --> 00:20:16.933
That's an A, honey.

361
00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:19.352
It'll get you sent
to the principal's office.

362
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.687
Sit down.

363
00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:23.398
We're lucky that this
is not a common occurrence.

364
00:20:23.566 --> 00:20:25.608
What would my punishment
have been otherwise?

365
00:20:25.776 --> 00:20:29.362
- Bed without supper, I guess.
- But I'm already finished.

366
00:20:30.197 --> 00:20:32.782
- No dating. No dating.
- Yeah, no dating.

367
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.951
- No dating for you, young lady.
- No dating.

368
00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:37.370
I think my complete lack of allure...

369
00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:40.123
...already kind of
shot that horse in the face.

370
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:43.460
I wouldn't know how to be grounded
more than you know how to ground.

371
00:20:43.627 --> 00:20:45.962
That's right. Love you. Come here.

372
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.841
And I bet that girl was acting
like exactly what you called her.

373
00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:51.134
Oh, you have no idea.

374
00:20:53.304 --> 00:20:55.805
I got a B-plus
on my spelling test today.

375
00:20:55.973 --> 00:20:59.559
That's good, honey, but everything
has spell check these days, so...

376
00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:00.894
Just kidding.

377
00:21:03.147 --> 00:21:05.064
Where are you from originally?

378
00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:07.192
<i>So the next day I had detention...</i>

379
00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:10.653
<i>... which, thanks to recent budget cuts,</i>
<i>meant cleaning.</i>

380
00:21:10.821 --> 00:21:13.239
<i>I was looking forward to</i>
<i>getting all this behind me.</i>

381
00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:15.992
<i>I had done the crime.</i>
<i>I was gonna do the time.</i>

382
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.369
<i>And that would be that,</i>
<i>but that...</i>

383
00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:21.331
Aren't there, like,
child labor laws against this?

384
00:21:21.499 --> 00:21:22.624
Not in high school.

385
00:21:22.792 --> 00:21:26.961
The principal's like the captain
of the ship in international waters.

386
00:21:27.129 --> 00:21:28.755
He can even marry people.

387
00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:32.425
We haven't talked in a while.
How have you been, Brandon?

388
00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:36.262
Fabulous. I'm crushing it.
Everything according to plan.

389
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.431
I wanna be in detention.

390
00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:39.849
Yeah, why are you here?

391
00:21:40.017 --> 00:21:43.478
From the blood I saw gushing out of
your nose, I thought you were bullied.

392
00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:47.023
Principal Gibbons is a homophobe,
which is why I called him a fascist.

393
00:21:47.191 --> 00:21:50.527
- So the rumors are true.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

394
00:21:50.694 --> 00:21:53.321
I meant about
Gibbons being a fascist.

395
00:21:54.949 --> 00:21:57.867
So, what's with your new look?
Very whore couture.

396
00:21:58.035 --> 00:22:01.371
Oh, haven't you heard?
I'm the new school slut.

397
00:22:01.539 --> 00:22:05.124
You know, I did hear something.
I also heard he was twice your age.

398
00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:07.877
Oh, no, no, no.
No, he was a freshman in college.

399
00:22:08.045 --> 00:22:10.171
I also heard he gave you crabs.

400
00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:13.049
- People suck.
- Tell me about it.

401
00:22:15.511 --> 00:22:16.636
He's not real.

402
00:22:18.138 --> 00:22:21.391
- What?
- The guy I slept with. I made him up.

403
00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:23.560
Wait, you started the rumor?

404
00:22:23.727 --> 00:22:25.770
Indirectly, I guess sort of.

405
00:22:25.938 --> 00:22:30.233
Or actually, no.
No, not really. No, I didn't.

406
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:33.361
Well, but you're perpetuating it.
That's really messed up.

407
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:34.654
Excuse me?

408
00:22:34.822 --> 00:22:37.907
You're not even a real slut.
You just want people to think you are.

409
00:22:38.075 --> 00:22:39.576
It's pathetic.

410
00:22:39.743 --> 00:22:44.581
No offense, but you could probably
learn something from me, Brando.

411
00:22:44.748 --> 00:22:49.460
Are you saying that I should
act straight so people will like me?

412
00:22:49.628 --> 00:22:53.423
That's groundbreaking. You should
teach a course at The Learning Annex.

413
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:56.676
It could be called "The Painfully
Obvious with Olive Penderghast...

414
00:22:56.844 --> 00:22:58.136
...the Fake School Slut."

415
00:22:58.304 --> 00:23:01.431
I was just suggesting that
maybe these kids we call peers...

416
00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:04.267
...are onto something.
You know, like Marianne Bryant.

417
00:23:04.435 --> 00:23:09.397
Maybe that whole stuck-up,
Jesus-freak thing is an act. You know?

418
00:23:09.565 --> 00:23:11.941
No, I think she's just
a stuck-up Jesus freak.

419
00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:15.361
And there are some of us who are
just trying to blend in to the crowd.

420
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:18.531
Well, then you've gotta do
everything you can to blend in...

421
00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:20.450
...or decide not to care.

422
00:23:21.118 --> 00:23:24.370
I can't decide if you're a genius
or a lunatic.

423
00:23:24.538 --> 00:23:28.541
Well, don't they sort of go
hand in hand?

424
00:23:30.336 --> 00:23:33.421
- So you heard any word from George?
- Nope.

425
00:23:33.589 --> 00:23:38.301
I told you, that was a one-night stand,
which is now over.

426
00:23:38.469 --> 00:23:40.553
You're being pretty cavalier
about this.

427
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:43.139
Aren't you supposed to be
eternally in love with him?

428
00:23:43.307 --> 00:23:46.976
Yes, I believe so. If I was a Gossip Girl
in Sweet Valley with traveling pants.

429
00:23:47.144 --> 00:23:51.481
But no, I'm not.
So I could really care less.

430
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:53.816
So Brandy Carter
was telling Vanessa Hodges...

431
00:23:53.984 --> 00:23:56.819
...that you were with three guys
in a Jacuzzi.

432
00:23:57.488 --> 00:23:58.905
Sounds like a lot of work.

433
00:23:59.073 --> 00:24:02.617
I guess that's still better than
getting it on with some old dude.

434
00:24:02.785 --> 00:24:04.118
Who said that?

435
00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:08.247
Do you know that Brandon kid?
That's what somebody told him.

436
00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:09.499
Isn't he a homo?

437
00:24:10.292 --> 00:24:11.501
Yeah.

438
00:24:17.591 --> 00:24:19.467
Speak of the devil. Hello.

439
00:24:19.635 --> 00:24:22.345
I was just talking about you
with my friend, Rhiannon.

440
00:24:22.513 --> 00:24:25.932
You know Rhiannon.
She's perpetually angry.

441
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.184
She curses like a Somali sailor. Bi...

442
00:24:28.352 --> 00:24:30.812
- Yeah. That's the one.
- "Bi..."? "Bi..."? What's "bi-"?

443
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.648
- Okay.
- I wanna know what "bi..." is.

444
00:24:33.816 --> 00:24:35.525
Hello, what's "bi..."? What is "bi..."?

445
00:24:35.693 --> 00:24:37.777
- Bye.
- "Bi..."? What is "bi..."?

446
00:24:37.945 --> 00:24:40.947
Bedazzling personality?
Beautiful, beautiful soul?

447
00:24:41.115 --> 00:24:43.700
- Big tits.
- That's my identifier?

448
00:24:44.618 --> 00:24:46.119
Yes!

449
00:24:46.286 --> 00:24:50.039
All right, well, that was Brandon. He
needs to talk to me about something.

450
00:24:50.207 --> 00:24:53.084
- Probably wants to borrow an outfit.
- Whatever, Big Tits.

451
00:24:53.252 --> 00:24:54.794
Heck, yeah!

452
00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:57.380
Big tits!

453
00:24:57.548 --> 00:25:00.341
The next day,
things took a turn for the scandalous...

454
00:25:00.509 --> 00:25:02.468
...which brings us to part three.

455
00:25:02.636 --> 00:25:06.389
A lady's choice
and a gentleman's agreement.

456
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:22.405
Hi. Is there an Olive here?

457
00:25:22.573 --> 00:25:24.741
There's a whole jar of them
in the fridge.

458
00:25:24.908 --> 00:25:27.076
I'm sorry,
I must have the wrong address.

459
00:25:27.244 --> 00:25:28.578
Just kidding. Come on in.

460
00:25:29.538 --> 00:25:32.665
Any friend of Olive's
is a friend of our daughter's.

461
00:25:33.292 --> 00:25:34.834
Olive, sweetie.

462
00:25:35.002 --> 00:25:37.086
There's a young man
here to see you.

463
00:25:37.254 --> 00:25:40.923
He said something about asking
for your hand in marriage.

464
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:43.384
Oh, happy day, Mama!

465
00:25:43.552 --> 00:25:45.887
Oh, I thought I was gonna have
to spend my dowry...

466
00:25:46.055 --> 00:25:48.890
...on booze and pills
to numb the Ioneliness.

467
00:25:49.058 --> 00:25:51.392
A gentleman caller, hurray!

468
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.895
- What's that?
- Olive has a boy in her room.

469
00:25:54.063 --> 00:25:55.229
- A boy?
- A boy.

470
00:25:55.397 --> 00:25:57.607
- Wow, a boy.
- A boy.

471
00:25:57.775 --> 00:25:59.442
A boy?

472
00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.444
A boy.

473
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:05.948
Welcome.
This is where the magic happens.

474
00:26:06.116 --> 00:26:07.784
And by magic I mean nothing.

475
00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:09.577
- Do you wanna go out with me?
- What?

476
00:26:09.745 --> 00:26:12.413
Well, I mean, like,
do you wanna be my girlfriend?

477
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:18.044
Brandon, just a couple hours ago
you told me you were Kinsey Six gay.

478
00:26:18.212 --> 00:26:20.963
True, but you said I should
pretend to be straight, so...

479
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:22.965
Yeah, I didn't mean with me.

480
00:26:23.133 --> 00:26:28.096
I mean, you're a nice guy and all,
but you're not really my type.

481
00:26:28.263 --> 00:26:30.056
Yeah, you're not really
my type either.

482
00:26:30.224 --> 00:26:33.142
Yeah, I know that. I got that V
where you'd rather see a P.

483
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.977
Do you wanna
have sex with me or not?

484
00:26:35.145 --> 00:26:37.105
Oh, my God, dude.

485
00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:38.731
You completely missed the point.

486
00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:41.651
- That's not what I was saying.
- I know what you were saying.

487
00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:44.320
I should act straight
till I get out of this hellhole.

488
00:26:44.488 --> 00:26:46.656
Then I can be whoever I wanna be.
I get that.

489
00:26:46.824 --> 00:26:49.659
You know that I didn't have sex
with a college guy, right?

490
00:26:49.827 --> 00:26:51.577
I just told everybody I did.

491
00:26:51.745 --> 00:26:55.331
Actually, I told one person I did.
And you know how these things work.

492
00:26:55.499 --> 00:26:56.666
It's like wildfire.

493
00:26:57.209 --> 00:27:00.419
So you're saying
I shouldn't really have sex?

494
00:27:00.587 --> 00:27:04.298
I should just say I had sex
with someone. A girl.

495
00:27:04.466 --> 00:27:06.843
Yes. Yes.

496
00:27:14.268 --> 00:27:15.852
Oh, no.

497
00:27:16.103 --> 00:27:19.230
- Wai... Just...
- Oh, no, no, no.

498
00:27:19.815 --> 00:27:22.525
- No way! No way!
- Just wait. Wait, wait. Stop it, stop it.

499
00:27:22.693 --> 00:27:25.027
- Absolutely not.
- Think about it. Think about it.

500
00:27:25.195 --> 00:27:27.446
- We could help each other out.
- No.

501
00:27:27.614 --> 00:27:30.199
You wanna maintain
this floozy facade.

502
00:27:30.367 --> 00:27:33.536
I don't wanna get pushed into shit
every day. It's a win-win-win.

503
00:27:33.704 --> 00:27:35.872
How do you know I like
being thought of as a floozy?

504
00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:38.124
Because at least
you're being thought of.

505
00:27:38.292 --> 00:27:41.335
Just one good imaginary bonk.

506
00:27:41.503 --> 00:27:44.046
You are on crack. All right?
And not the good kind.

507
00:27:44.214 --> 00:27:45.548
It doesn't have to be a bonk.

508
00:27:45.716 --> 00:27:48.217
It could be an imaginary butterbean,
lemon squeeze...

509
00:27:48.385 --> 00:27:51.596
- I don't know what any of that means.
- That's because you're a virgin.

510
00:27:51.763 --> 00:27:53.890
You know what?
This is not the answer at all.

511
00:27:54.057 --> 00:27:57.143
- I'll pay you whatever you want.
- I don't want your money, Brandon.

512
00:27:57.311 --> 00:27:59.312
Just do what I did
and make someone up.

513
00:27:59.479 --> 00:28:01.355
Who's going to believe me?

514
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.320
You don't understand how hard it is,
all right? I'm tormented.

515
00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:11.699
And every day at school
is like I'm being suffocated.

516
00:28:11.867 --> 00:28:14.243
And sure, we can sit
and fantasize all we want...

517
00:28:14.411 --> 00:28:16.871
...about how things
are gonna be different one day...

518
00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.915
...but this is today and it sucks.

519
00:28:19.082 --> 00:28:22.293
There's only one way around it.
You were smart enough to think of it.

520
00:28:22.461 --> 00:28:25.046
So please, just help me.

521
00:28:25.214 --> 00:28:28.883
Because I can't take another day
of this. I don't know what I'll do.

522
00:28:36.725 --> 00:28:39.268
I don't do anything half-assed.
All right?

523
00:28:39.436 --> 00:28:40.937
It'll have to be a public event.

524
00:28:41.104 --> 00:28:43.522
Melody Bostic is throwing
a party tomorrow night.

525
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.610
All of your tormentors will be there.
You and I are going together. All right?

526
00:28:47.778 --> 00:28:51.948
You have to do everything I say and
tell everyone that I am sensational.

527
00:28:52.115 --> 00:28:55.243
- Thank you so much for doing this.
- Just...

528
00:28:55.869 --> 00:28:59.080
...you know, make sure you're ready
to live with the consequences.

529
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.210
- What the hell is a lemon squeeze?
- It's like a backwards melon bag.

530
00:29:04.378 --> 00:29:07.421
How don't I know any of this?

531
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:11.968
<i>The next night was the party</i>
<i>at Melody Bostic's house.</i>

532
00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:14.470
<i>She is the most popular girl</i>
<i>in school.</i>

533
00:29:14.638 --> 00:29:17.181
<i>It's partly because she's pretty</i>
<i>and has perfect hair...</i>

534
00:29:17.349 --> 00:29:20.268
<i>... but mostly because her parents</i>
<i>let her have these parties...</i>

535
00:29:20.435 --> 00:29:22.895
<i>... every time she catches them</i>
<i>doing it in the pool...</i>

536
00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:26.190
<i>... which is every week, apparently.</i>

537
00:29:26.358 --> 00:29:29.318
<i>Brandon and I showed up</i>
<i>when it was in full swing.</i>

538
00:29:29.486 --> 00:29:32.613
<i>I borrowed a dress from my mom,</i>
<i>Brandon borrowed a jacket from me...</i>

539
00:29:32.781 --> 00:29:34.699
<i>... and we put on a little show.</i>

540
00:29:34.866 --> 00:29:37.535
Hey, Olive and Brandon.

541
00:29:37.703 --> 00:29:38.995
What's up?

542
00:29:39.162 --> 00:29:42.540
I hope you don't mind, but we had
a few pre-cocktail-party cocktails...

543
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:45.793
...like, before the cocktail party
with cocktails.

544
00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:50.631
Listen, here's the sitch,
Melody Bostic.

545
00:29:51.383 --> 00:29:55.428
Brandon was just in the middle
of telling me this really funny thing...

546
00:29:55.595 --> 00:29:56.762
...which is really funny.

547
00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:00.725
And I was wondering if there's,
like, a room where we could go...

548
00:30:00.892 --> 00:30:04.186
...where he could finish telling me
that thing that's funny...

549
00:30:04.354 --> 00:30:05.646
...if you know what I mean.

550
00:30:05.814 --> 00:30:07.106
You can use my room.

551
00:30:08.275 --> 00:30:10.026
Down the hall to the left.

552
00:30:11.278 --> 00:30:13.529
Cool.

553
00:30:14.656 --> 00:30:16.782
Is that Olive with Brandon?

554
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.868
I know. What the hell, right?

555
00:30:19.036 --> 00:30:20.745
You guys are my buddies.

556
00:30:20.912 --> 00:30:22.538
I'm drunk, bitches. What's up?

557
00:30:22.706 --> 00:30:24.206
I love your room!

558
00:30:24.374 --> 00:30:26.709
My sheets. Put a towel down.

559
00:30:26.877 --> 00:30:30.588
- Olive's gonna do a gay dude.
- Thanks. Close the shades.

560
00:30:35.385 --> 00:30:36.802
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

561
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.639
Jesus, what is with you gays? Are you
really that repulsed by lady parts?

562
00:30:40.807 --> 00:30:43.059
What do you think I have down there,
a gnome?

563
00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:53.152
So nice. What is that, lavender?
It's pretty.

564
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.030
What are you doing? Can you...?
Can you come here, please?

565
00:30:56.198 --> 00:30:58.366
Jacket off. Come on.

566
00:30:58.533 --> 00:31:02.161
All right. Come on.
Chop-chop. All right.

567
00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:04.705
Now grunt.
Grunt and make it convincing.

568
00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.418
I said grunt, not whine. Just grunt.

569
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.092
Moan, you know? Like, sex noises.

570
00:31:18.095 --> 00:31:19.261
God, you are pathetic.

571
00:31:27.062 --> 00:31:28.938
Good. Good.

572
00:31:31.274 --> 00:31:33.651
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

573
00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.611
Oh, yeah.

574
00:31:35.779 --> 00:31:38.072
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

575
00:31:42.077 --> 00:31:44.745
- You don't have to be so aggressive.
- You don't like that?

576
00:31:44.913 --> 00:31:46.956
- No, I don't like that.
- You don't like that?

577
00:31:47.124 --> 00:31:48.416
How about that?

578
00:31:48.583 --> 00:31:50.418
- Little better.
- Yeah, you like that.

579
00:31:50.585 --> 00:31:52.294
I like that.

580
00:31:52.462 --> 00:31:55.423
- This guy, he's gay, no?
- I think he's gay.

581
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.092
- Don't stop!
- Keep going.

582
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.469
- Don't stop.
- I'm not gonna stop.

583
00:32:00.637 --> 00:32:01.929
I'm not gonna stop.

584
00:32:02.097 --> 00:32:03.472
Now you try. You try.

585
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.810
I'm gonna turn you around
and take you from the back.

586
00:32:07.978 --> 00:32:10.479
That's not gonna make people
think you're straight.

587
00:32:10.647 --> 00:32:14.817
Never mind that gayness
because I'm a straight guy. Roar!

588
00:32:18.321 --> 00:32:20.823
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

589
00:32:20.991 --> 00:32:23.159
- That's awesome! That's perfect!
- Yeah!

590
00:32:23.326 --> 00:32:24.952
That's what I'm talking about!

591
00:32:25.328 --> 00:32:28.456
Do you smell that?
Do you smell us?

592
00:32:29.332 --> 00:32:31.333
Did he just say it smelled?

593
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:34.503
Isn't it supposed to smell?

594
00:32:34.671 --> 00:32:36.464
You're not supposed
to comment on it.

595
00:32:36.631 --> 00:32:41.093
- It doesn't really smell that bad.
- Oh, yeah. Yes, God!

596
00:32:41.261 --> 00:32:44.305
- Don't stop. Yeah!
- Don't stop. It's too much fun.

597
00:32:44.473 --> 00:32:46.599
- You ready for the grand finale?
- Yeah. What?

598
00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:52.062
Oh, yeah.

599
00:32:52.355 --> 00:32:53.439
Yeah.

600
00:32:57.486 --> 00:32:59.487
Come on.

601
00:32:59.654 --> 00:33:01.322
Oh, my God.

602
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.161
Go forth, my son.
You're a man now.

603
00:33:08.705 --> 00:33:09.830
Hey.

604
00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:12.500
Thank you.

605
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:18.631
Seriously, thanks.

606
00:33:27.307 --> 00:33:28.349
- Here.
- What is this?

607
00:33:28.683 --> 00:33:29.767
Evidence.

608
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.150
What's up?

609
00:33:43.073 --> 00:33:44.698
Hey, man.

610
00:33:45.242 --> 00:33:46.242
How was she?

611
00:33:46.409 --> 00:33:51.497
Well, well, let's just say
I'll be walking funny tomorrow.

612
00:33:51.665 --> 00:33:53.499
What?

613
00:33:54.167 --> 00:33:56.752
- I'm drunk. What's up, bitches?
- Yeah!

614
00:34:08.557 --> 00:34:11.267
- Whoa, hey.
- Todd, hi.

615
00:34:11.434 --> 00:34:13.894
I thought you were at
your cousin's rehearsal dinner.

616
00:34:14.062 --> 00:34:16.772
It was a quick rehearsal.
I only had one line.

617
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.440
That was a joke.

618
00:34:19.484 --> 00:34:21.068
I know.

619
00:34:21.319 --> 00:34:23.362
Yeah, sorry. How's it going?

620
00:34:24.155 --> 00:34:26.282
You know, I'm...

621
00:34:26.825 --> 00:34:28.617
- I'm here.
- Can I get you a beer?

622
00:34:28.785 --> 00:34:31.120
That rhymed. I liked it.

623
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.038
Yeah.

624
00:34:42.382 --> 00:34:44.466
- I'm gonna go.
- You sure?

625
00:34:44.634 --> 00:34:48.637
- Yeah. Bye.
- See you at the salt mines.

626
00:34:48.972 --> 00:34:50.639
<i>Maybe this is gonna sound stupid...</i>

627
00:34:50.807 --> 00:34:54.226
...and, believe me, it's not like
I was expecting, you know, fireworks...

628
00:34:54.394 --> 00:34:56.937
...or a string quartet or anything...

629
00:34:57.856 --> 00:35:00.524
...but I always thought pretending
to lose my virginity...

630
00:35:00.692 --> 00:35:02.443
...would be a little more...

631
00:35:02.611 --> 00:35:04.737
...I don't know, special?

632
00:35:05.822 --> 00:35:08.532
Judy Blume should've
prepared me for that.

633
00:35:16.166 --> 00:35:17.625
That is so beautiful.

634
00:35:17.792 --> 00:35:19.251
Never had one lesson.

635
00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:21.879
That boy from yesterday
just dropped this off for you.

636
00:35:22.047 --> 00:35:26.300
Well, put it in the pile of gifts
from my other suitors.

637
00:35:26.468 --> 00:35:29.261
- Thanks.
- He seems like a nice kid.

638
00:35:29.429 --> 00:35:31.472
He seemed a little incredibly gay.

639
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.099
A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual,
that boy is.

640
00:35:34.267 --> 00:35:37.519
I just want you to know
your father and I are totally supportive.

641
00:35:37.687 --> 00:35:40.064
We love you no matter
what the sexual orientation...

642
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:41.940
...of your opposite-sex sex partner.

643
00:35:42.108 --> 00:35:43.359
We're not dating, Mom.

644
00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:46.320
And don't worry about
not making us grandparents...

645
00:35:46.488 --> 00:35:49.406
...although we were kind of hoping
you'd get knocked up...

646
00:35:49.574 --> 00:35:51.950
...so we'd have a second shot
at raising kids.

647
00:35:52.118 --> 00:35:54.328
Really do it right this time.

648
00:35:54.496 --> 00:35:57.665
- Bye now.
- I dated a homosexual once.

649
00:35:57.832 --> 00:36:01.043
For a long time, actually.
A long time.

650
00:36:01.211 --> 00:36:04.922
Dear God, dear Lord, tell me you did
not marry and have children with him.

651
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.632
No.

652
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.841
No, no, no.

653
00:36:08.009 --> 00:36:10.052
Your father is as straight
as they come.

654
00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.554
A little too straight,
if you know what I mean.

655
00:36:12.722 --> 00:36:15.224
I don't. Can you shut the door, please?

656
00:36:18.353 --> 00:36:20.938
Okay, door's right over there.
Keep going.

657
00:36:21.106 --> 00:36:25.484
- Take it down.
- Go take that out to Dad. Nice.

658
00:36:32.117 --> 00:36:36.245
"Just in case you don't shop at Target.
Then you can go screw yourself.

659
00:36:36.413 --> 00:36:37.996
Brandon."

660
00:36:46.089 --> 00:36:47.131
Hi, Rhi.

661
00:36:47.298 --> 00:36:50.551
Is it true you got with Brandon
at Melody Dipshit's party?

662
00:36:51.302 --> 00:36:53.137
Is that what people
are saying happened?

663
00:36:53.304 --> 00:36:56.265
<i>That's what everyone</i>
<i>is saying happened.</i>

664
00:36:56.433 --> 00:36:59.309
Well, then I guess that...
I guess that's true.

665
00:36:59.477 --> 00:37:02.396
Just because you lost your virginity
doesn't mean you can go...

666
00:37:02.564 --> 00:37:06.275
...throwing your cat at everybody.
- I'm not throwing my cat at everybody.

667
00:37:06.443 --> 00:37:09.445
I had to hear from Jackie Rudetsky.

668
00:37:09.612 --> 00:37:11.280
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>how embarrassing that is?</i>

669
00:37:11.448 --> 00:37:15.784
Finding out you slept with some
gay dude from Jackie Rudetsky?

670
00:37:15.952 --> 00:37:17.327
Must've been embarrassing.

671
00:37:17.495 --> 00:37:19.246
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>you were going?</i>

672
00:37:19.414 --> 00:37:21.415
I would've come with
and held your hair.

673
00:37:21.583 --> 00:37:23.709
Are you really making this
about you right now?

674
00:37:23.877 --> 00:37:27.463
- You're starting to get a reputation.
- You're coming off as a little pious.

675
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.339
You're pissing me off
more than usual.

676
00:37:29.507 --> 00:37:31.467
<i>I think it's a best friend's duty...</i>

677
00:37:31.634 --> 00:37:35.971
...to let her know that everyone, and
I do mean everyone, is calling her...

678
00:37:36.139 --> 00:37:37.723
...a dirty skank.

679
00:37:38.266 --> 00:37:41.643
Well, do you think I'm a dirty skank?

680
00:37:41.811 --> 00:37:44.730
You know, I didn't wanna believe it,
but I guess it's true.

681
00:37:44.898 --> 00:37:47.649
<i>That is your identifier.</i>

682
00:37:47.817 --> 00:37:50.235
And you're a jealous virgin.

683
00:37:50.403 --> 00:37:51.570
So...

684
00:37:53.448 --> 00:37:55.491
<i>People thought I was a dirty skank?</i>

685
00:37:55.658 --> 00:37:58.827
<i>Fine, I'd be the dirtiest skank</i>
<i>they'd ever seen.</i>

686
00:38:21.184 --> 00:38:22.851
Shit.

687
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.943
Is everything all right? It sounds like
you're having sex in here...

688
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.696
...which can't be true, due to the fact
that you have a homosexual boyfriend.

689
00:38:34.864 --> 00:38:37.282
He's not my boyfriend.

690
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.161
Hey, no judgment.
All God's children. It's fine.

691
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:44.039
I was gay once for a while.

692
00:38:44.207 --> 00:38:47.376
No big deal. We all do it. It's okay.

693
00:38:47.544 --> 00:38:49.461
Dad, can you just
shut the door, please?

694
00:38:49.629 --> 00:38:50.712
You all right, buddy?

695
00:38:53.007 --> 00:38:54.550
Yeah.

696
00:38:55.552 --> 00:38:57.135
Give them hell.

697
00:39:42.432 --> 00:39:44.266
- Hey, Anson.
- Hey.

698
00:39:44.434 --> 00:39:49.938
I just realized the funniest thing.
My name is an anagram for "I love."

699
00:39:50.565 --> 00:39:52.941
What's a...? What's an anagram?

700
00:39:53.276 --> 00:39:54.401
Look it up, big boy.

701
00:39:55.612 --> 00:39:56.945
What's your problem?

702
00:39:57.113 --> 00:39:58.697
You wanna know
what my problem is?

703
00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:02.701
No. That was a rhetorical question.
I don't wanna know anything from you.

704
00:40:02.869 --> 00:40:04.870
We are not friends anymore.

705
00:40:05.038 --> 00:40:06.830
We are officially over.

706
00:40:06.998 --> 00:40:08.457
Oh, rats.

707
00:40:08.625 --> 00:40:12.836
I want my Juicy sweatshirt back. It was
too loose around your chest anyway.

708
00:40:13.004 --> 00:40:15.047
Burn.

709
00:40:15.423 --> 00:40:17.132
- Stop.
- What?

710
00:40:36.819 --> 00:40:38.487
What are you doing?

711
00:40:39.656 --> 00:40:41.281
Nothing.

712
00:40:44.953 --> 00:40:47.454
Don't forget, tomorrow's Earth Day.

713
00:40:48.164 --> 00:40:51.833
Guys, we have a problem:
Olive Penderghast.

714
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:53.669
- We need to pray for her.
- Amen.

715
00:40:53.836 --> 00:40:56.421
But we also need to
get her the hell out of here.

716
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:57.631
Amen.

717
00:40:57.799 --> 00:41:00.008
You heard what happened
at Melody Bostic's.

718
00:41:00.176 --> 00:41:03.053
- I was there. I heard the whole thing.
- That's not something...

719
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:06.181
...you need to advertise, Kurt.
- Sorry. But I was.

720
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:10.519
I tried to witness to her, but this girl
is defiant to any type of help.

721
00:41:10.687 --> 00:41:13.355
Anybody here think they can
talk to her, get her to see...

722
00:41:13.523 --> 00:41:15.565
...what she's doing is wrong?

723
00:41:18.194 --> 00:41:21.446
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry, you guys. This is so stupid.

724
00:41:21.614 --> 00:41:24.950
No, it's not, Marianne. It's real.

725
00:41:25.118 --> 00:41:26.201
- It's real.
- Yeah, it is.

726
00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:28.245
Jesus tells us to love everyone.

727
00:41:28.413 --> 00:41:33.000
I mean, even the whores and
the homosexuals, but it's just so hard.

728
00:41:33.167 --> 00:41:37.713
It's so hard because they keep
doing it over and over again.

729
00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.465
Make me a promise.

730
00:41:40.633 --> 00:41:43.218
Make God a promise,
right here and right now...

731
00:41:43.386 --> 00:41:46.346
...that we will remain
pure and chaste until marriage.

732
00:41:46.514 --> 00:41:47.556
We promise.

733
00:41:47.724 --> 00:41:51.059
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

734
00:41:51.227 --> 00:41:55.605
I love you guys. God loves you guys.
Now, let's change lives today.

735
00:41:55.773 --> 00:41:57.816
- Micah?
- Let's do it.

736
00:42:22.383 --> 00:42:24.551
<i>I didn't know what they</i>
<i>were so upset about.</i>

737
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:27.596
<i>I put an A on my wardrobe</i>
<i>just like they asked.</i>

738
00:42:27.764 --> 00:42:31.099
<i>Maybe it was because I was wearing</i>
<i>clothes that were two sizes too small.</i>

739
00:42:31.267 --> 00:42:32.601
Hey, Olive!

740
00:42:34.812 --> 00:42:37.481
You left your glass slipper
at the party the other night.

741
00:42:37.648 --> 00:42:40.901
Yeah, and I got pumpkin
all over my dress too.

742
00:42:41.903 --> 00:42:44.279
Nice. Solid joke.

743
00:42:44.447 --> 00:42:46.990
It sucks because we could've
revisited Melody's bedroom.

744
00:42:47.158 --> 00:42:49.242
Oh, my God,
that was Melody Bostic's house.

745
00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.120
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you remember that.

746
00:42:52.288 --> 00:42:55.791
Well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't
remember their first almost-kiss?

747
00:42:58.461 --> 00:42:59.920
Hey, Olive.

748
00:43:00.088 --> 00:43:01.797
Evan. Hey, what's rocking?

749
00:43:01.964 --> 00:43:03.465
Can I talk to you for a second?

750
00:43:03.633 --> 00:43:05.342
Yeah, what's up?

751
00:43:05.802 --> 00:43:08.345
Don't get mad, but Brandon told me
what you did for him.

752
00:43:08.513 --> 00:43:12.307
Oh, well, rest assured,
it was equally as thrilling for me.

753
00:43:12.475 --> 00:43:14.267
No, he told me the truth.

754
00:43:15.394 --> 00:43:17.521
I was just hoping
you could do the same for me?

755
00:43:18.022 --> 00:43:19.439
Goodbye, Evan.

756
00:43:19.607 --> 00:43:22.400
Wait, wait. I can pay you.

757
00:43:22.568 --> 00:43:25.362
I am about six seconds away
from slapping you so hard...

758
00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.573
...your teeth will bleed.
- Can you do it in front of everyone?

759
00:43:30.368 --> 00:43:32.869
I don't need your permission,
you know.

760
00:43:35.123 --> 00:43:36.331
What?

761
00:43:36.499 --> 00:43:39.126
I mean, at the rate you're going...

762
00:43:39.293 --> 00:43:41.461
...I don't see how people
won't believe it.

763
00:43:41.629 --> 00:43:44.047
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll give you 100 bucks.

764
00:43:44.215 --> 00:43:45.632
You are repugnant.

765
00:43:46.509 --> 00:43:47.884
That's the problem.

766
00:43:49.512 --> 00:43:50.512
Never mind.

767
00:43:51.681 --> 00:43:53.682
I'm sorry I asked.

768
00:44:00.481 --> 00:44:02.566
I knew it wouldn't work.

769
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:04.442
I'm just a fat piece of shit.

770
00:44:05.987 --> 00:44:07.946
When will high school end already?

771
00:44:13.536 --> 00:44:15.370
Shit.

772
00:44:15.538 --> 00:44:20.000
I want a $100 gift card deposited
into my locker by noon tomorrow.

773
00:44:20.168 --> 00:44:23.378
Preferably to the Gap, but I will
also take Amazon.com or OfficeMax.

774
00:44:23.546 --> 00:44:27.549
Actually, make it OfficeMax.
I have my eye on a label maker.

775
00:44:27.717 --> 00:44:30.343
We did not have sex, okay?

776
00:44:30.511 --> 00:44:33.555
I let you fondle my chest,
and it was a glorious moment for you...

777
00:44:33.723 --> 00:44:36.892
...unmatched by anything
you've experienced, including cake.

778
00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:38.101
Got it?

779
00:44:38.811 --> 00:44:41.229
Wait a minute.
A hundred bucks for second base?

780
00:44:41.397 --> 00:44:43.857
- Yeah.
- Doesn't that seem a little steep?

781
00:44:44.025 --> 00:44:47.736
Can we throw in, like, some
butt action or some pants rubbing?

782
00:44:47.904 --> 00:44:50.488
- What are you, 9?
- Whatever. Are you in?

783
00:44:52.533 --> 00:44:54.701
- Whatever.
- Deal, then.

784
00:44:55.494 --> 00:44:56.995
Thanks, Olive.

785
00:44:57.163 --> 00:44:58.788
You know, the sad thing is, Evan...

786
00:44:58.956 --> 00:45:03.418
...if you'd been a gentleman
and maybe asked me on a date...

787
00:45:03.586 --> 00:45:04.794
...I might've said yes.

788
00:45:04.962 --> 00:45:07.589
Really?
Do you wanna go out with me?

789
00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:09.299
Not now I don't, shit-dick.

790
00:45:12.929 --> 00:45:16.598
<i>It should come as no surprise that the</i>
<i>rumor I was soliciting sex for money...</i>

791
00:45:16.766 --> 00:45:19.017
<i>... spread around the school</i>
<i>faster than...</i>

792
00:45:19.185 --> 00:45:22.854
<i>Well, faster than the first rumor</i>
<i>about me spread.</i>

793
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.734
Guys, come over here.

794
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.638
She'll do stuff for money.
Around the world...

795
00:45:56.806 --> 00:45:59.975
<i>But for people who knew the truth,</i>
<i>I was open for business.</i>

796
00:46:00.142 --> 00:46:04.604
<i>And whether I liked it or not,</i>
<i>I had a lot of customers.</i>

797
00:46:05.815 --> 00:46:08.149
<i>Phil Lord gave me</i>
<i>100 bucks from Best Buy...</i>

798
00:46:08.317 --> 00:46:11.820
<i>... so he could tell people</i>
<i>we hooked up behind the library.</i>

799
00:46:11.988 --> 00:46:14.739
<i>I got $50 from T.J. Maxx</i>
<i>so that Eric Ling could say...</i>

800
00:46:14.907 --> 00:46:17.534
<i>... we got it on during Chemistry.</i>

801
00:46:17.868 --> 00:46:21.454
<i>Ninety dollars from Panda Express</i>
<i>so Ryan Dukes could tell people...</i>

802
00:46:21.622 --> 00:46:25.333
<i>... I showed him mine,</i>
<i>but he did not show me his.</i>

803
00:46:25.501 --> 00:46:27.794
<i>Chris Miller,</i>
<i>big spender that he is...</i>

804
00:46:27.962 --> 00:46:31.506
<i>... gave me $40 worth of movie passes</i>
<i>for my pretend cowbell.</i>

805
00:46:31.674 --> 00:46:33.967
<i>They had an expiration date</i>
<i>and were only good...</i>

806
00:46:34.135 --> 00:46:35.969
<i>... at the stupid foreign movie theater.</i>

807
00:46:36.137 --> 00:46:42.142
Hi. One for
<i>Der Scharlachrote Buchstabe.</i>

808
00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.270
<i>But even that is better</i>
<i>than Sanjay Chandrasekhar.</i>

809
00:46:45.438 --> 00:46:49.566
Seriously? A coupon? Twenty percent
off to Bath & Body Works?

810
00:46:49.734 --> 00:46:52.902
Is that how much our imaginary tryst
meant to you?

811
00:46:53.279 --> 00:46:54.863
I fake rocked your world.

812
00:46:55.031 --> 00:46:57.532
- It's all I can afford.
- How's that my problem, amigo?

813
00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.702
<i>I knew he wasn't Latino,</i>
<i>but for some reason all these shady...</i>

814
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.163
<i>... backdoor deals</i>
<i>had me talking like Carlito.</i>

815
00:47:03.539 --> 00:47:05.665
- Beat it, ese.
- Okay.

816
00:47:05.833 --> 00:47:07.792
<i>Whatever happened to chivalry?</i>

817
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.879
Does it only exist in '80s movies?

818
00:47:11.047 --> 00:47:15.133
<i>I want John Cusack holding</i>
<i>a boombox outside my window.</i>

819
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:17.927
<i>I wanna ride off on a lawn mower</i>
<i>with Patrick Dempsey.</i>

820
00:47:18.387 --> 00:47:22.182
I want Jake from Sixteen Candles
<i>waiting outside the church for me.</i>

821
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:25.101
<i>I want Judd Nelson</i>
<i>thrusting his fist into the air...</i>

822
00:47:25.269 --> 00:47:26.728
<i>... because he knows he got me.</i>

823
00:47:26.896 --> 00:47:29.856
<i>Just once, I want my life</i>
<i>to be like an '80s movie.</i>

824
00:47:30.441 --> 00:47:33.234
<i>Preferably one with a really awesome</i>
<i>musical number...</i>

825
00:47:33.402 --> 00:47:35.445
<i>... for no apparent reason.</i>

826
00:47:35.988 --> 00:47:40.533
But, no. No.
John Hughes did not direct my life.

827
00:47:40.701 --> 00:47:43.495
So instead of all that...

828
00:47:43.662 --> 00:47:46.873
...I get to save 15 cents...

829
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:49.876
...on a bottle of Juniper Breeze
Antibacterial Gel.

830
00:47:50.044 --> 00:47:54.339
So if you're still with me,
and I'm hoping that most of you are...

831
00:47:54.507 --> 00:47:57.258
...this brings us to part four.

832
00:47:58.761 --> 00:48:02.097
How I, Olive Penderghast,
went from assumed trollop...

833
00:48:02.264 --> 00:48:03.932
...to an actual home-wrecker.

834
00:48:06.268 --> 00:48:10.105
- You wanted to see me?
- I did. Why don't you come in here?

835
00:48:17.613 --> 00:48:18.655
What's going on?

836
00:48:19.448 --> 00:48:22.117
- I'm accessorizing.
- Really?

837
00:48:22.284 --> 00:48:25.829
I think you're taking your reading
assignment a little bit too seriously.

838
00:48:25.996 --> 00:48:29.374
Well, I was really hoping
to get an A. Get it?

839
00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.795
I'm hearing some rumors.

840
00:48:33.963 --> 00:48:37.173
Well, those are true. I am considering
becoming an existentialist.

841
00:48:37.341 --> 00:48:39.926
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Jeez.

842
00:48:40.094 --> 00:48:44.389
When did teachers become
privy to idle adolescent gossip?

843
00:48:44.557 --> 00:48:50.395
That would be when everyone
is putting everything up on Facebook.

844
00:48:50.563 --> 00:48:52.981
I don't know what
your generation's fascination is...

845
00:48:53.149 --> 00:48:55.525
...with documenting
your every thought...

846
00:48:55.693 --> 00:48:58.903
...but I can assure you
they're not all diamonds.

847
00:48:59.071 --> 00:49:01.489
"Roman is having an okay day...

848
00:49:01.657 --> 00:49:05.827
...and bought a Coke Zero
at the gas station.

849
00:49:05.995 --> 00:49:07.412
Raise the roof."

850
00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.830
Who gives a rat's ass?

851
00:49:08.998 --> 00:49:11.332
He got a Coke Zero again?

852
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.668
That Roman. Incorrigible.

853
00:49:13.836 --> 00:49:17.547
Listen, whatever this little act is about,
I just... I'm curious.

854
00:49:17.715 --> 00:49:20.633
I really think you should consider
giving me extra credit...

855
00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:22.093
...for going the extra mile.

856
00:49:22.261 --> 00:49:25.263
I'm really attempting to understand
this puritanical ostracism...

857
00:49:25.431 --> 00:49:28.475
...Hawthorne wrote about.
- You are one of the few that read it.

858
00:49:28.642 --> 00:49:31.311
If I read one more paper
from one of your classmates...

859
00:49:31.479 --> 00:49:36.107
...who talks about how hot she is in
the bathtub, her fake British accent...

860
00:49:36.275 --> 00:49:40.320
...or, is she still married to
Ashton Kutcher, I'm gonna kill myself.

861
00:49:40.488 --> 00:49:43.156
Why don't people just watch
the original movie like I did?

862
00:49:43.741 --> 00:49:45.158
I know you read the book.

863
00:49:46.202 --> 00:49:47.368
I did.

864
00:49:47.536 --> 00:49:50.955
Listen, I want to apologize for
sending you to the principal's office.

865
00:49:51.123 --> 00:49:53.625
Truthfully, and I'll deny it
if you say anything...

866
00:49:53.792 --> 00:49:56.544
...I wanted to be cheering
with the rest of the students.

867
00:49:56.712 --> 00:49:59.214
I don't know what it is about Nina.

868
00:49:59.507 --> 00:50:01.132
I hate her.

869
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.342
I won't tell.

870
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:03.927
- I'll deny it if you do.
- Okay.

871
00:50:04.094 --> 00:50:06.221
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

872
00:50:06.388 --> 00:50:08.014
Stay golden.

873
00:50:08.182 --> 00:50:11.726
- Hi, Mrs. Griffith.
- Hi, you. How are you?

874
00:50:11.894 --> 00:50:14.229
A is for "awesome."

875
00:50:14.396 --> 00:50:15.939
Yeah.

876
00:50:16.565 --> 00:50:18.274
I've never seen that girl before.

877
00:50:18.442 --> 00:50:20.318
That does not surprise me.

878
00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:23.404
But I'm the guidance counselor.
I should know all the students.

879
00:50:23.572 --> 00:50:26.074
Especially the ones
who dress like prostitutes.

880
00:50:26.242 --> 00:50:28.952
- It's good to see you.
- Hey. How are you? Good.

881
00:50:29.745 --> 00:50:33.414
No, stop. We're at school.
There are rules.

882
00:50:33.582 --> 00:50:35.917
- Windows.
- Yeah, yeah.

883
00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.253
Do me a favor, though.
Just talk to her.

884
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.213
I think she's going through a phase.

885
00:50:40.381 --> 00:50:42.924
That's not the girl
everyone's talking about, is it?

886
00:50:43.092 --> 00:50:44.092
It is.

887
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:46.886
Oh, okay. Oh, this'll be good.
All right.

888
00:50:47.054 --> 00:50:49.514
That snotty, Jesus-freak
office aide I have...

889
00:50:49.682 --> 00:50:51.641
...has been bitching
about her incessantly.

890
00:50:51.809 --> 00:50:56.104
They're all lies, but she could use
somebody to talk to anyway.

891
00:50:56.272 --> 00:50:58.856
All right. Hey, what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

892
00:50:59.024 --> 00:51:00.567
- You won't be there?
- Sorry.

893
00:51:00.734 --> 00:51:03.778
I have an after-school session.
Kid brought a knife to school.

894
00:51:03.946 --> 00:51:05.238
Well, be careful, all right?

895
00:51:05.406 --> 00:51:07.865
It was a butter knife.
But you know what they say.

896
00:51:08.033 --> 00:51:09.993
You know, it's a gateway knife, so...

897
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.661
- All right, bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

898
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:14.581
I'm thinking about another gateway.
It's a...

899
00:51:17.418 --> 00:51:18.459
Making spaghetti.

900
00:51:18.627 --> 00:51:20.545
- That's great.
- With meat.

901
00:51:20.713 --> 00:51:22.046
Enjoy eating your meat.

902
00:51:22.214 --> 00:51:24.924
- And balls.
- Enjoy eating your balls.

903
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.185
Sharpening your pencils?

904
00:51:37.688 --> 00:51:39.105
Getting them nice and sharp?

905
00:51:39.773 --> 00:51:44.068
Sharpening them up? Look at you.
Look at you. So sharp.

906
00:51:44.236 --> 00:51:46.529
Sharpening those pencils.
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

907
00:51:46.989 --> 00:51:49.824
- God, that's sharp. L...
- Hey, Olive. You ready to come in?

908
00:51:52.828 --> 00:51:53.870
Good job.

909
00:51:54.038 --> 00:51:56.623
Well, the reason I called you in
was just so we could...

910
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.667
...sort of, you know, just chat
about what's going on.

911
00:51:59.835 --> 00:52:02.462
You know, there is concern
from a few faculty members.

912
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.130
Your husband.

913
00:52:04.298 --> 00:52:06.799
Olive, you're attempting
to make a statement.

914
00:52:06.967 --> 00:52:10.178
I'm just a little confused
as to what exactly that is.

915
00:52:10.804 --> 00:52:11.846
Am I in trouble?

916
00:52:12.014 --> 00:52:14.474
Because, pursuant
to the student code of conduct...

917
00:52:14.642 --> 00:52:17.310
...my hemline has never been
higher than my fingertips.

918
00:52:17.478 --> 00:52:18.811
No, you're not in trouble.

919
00:52:18.979 --> 00:52:20.521
I wanted to make sure you knew...

920
00:52:20.689 --> 00:52:23.066
...if there's something
that you wanna talk about...

921
00:52:23.233 --> 00:52:25.026
...you know, you can trust me.

922
00:52:25.194 --> 00:52:29.155
If I open up to you, do you promise
this stays in confidence?

923
00:52:30.199 --> 00:52:32.575
Yeah. I'm... See?
I'm the guidance counselor.

924
00:52:32.743 --> 00:52:34.118
That's what I do.

925
00:52:34.536 --> 00:52:36.537
I mean, I have a reputation to uphold.

926
00:52:36.705 --> 00:52:37.872
Don't you, though?

927
00:52:40.376 --> 00:52:44.379
All right, listen, don't tell anyone
I'm doing this, please.

928
00:52:44.546 --> 00:52:45.672
Here you go.

929
00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:47.715
- Here you go.
- I really don't need those.

930
00:52:47.883 --> 00:52:51.260
Oh, you really do. Here you go.

931
00:52:51.428 --> 00:52:53.012
Here you go. Okay?

932
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.933
I just don't want this thing you're
going through to define your life.

933
00:52:57.101 --> 00:52:58.810
Olive, do what you gotta do. Okay?

934
00:52:58.977 --> 00:53:03.481
Let your freak flag fly. Just make sure
you have an exit strategy.

935
00:53:04.233 --> 00:53:07.610
Listen, Mrs. Griffith, I really...
I don't need these.

936
00:53:07.778 --> 00:53:10.196
The pill is not 100 percent effective.

937
00:53:10.364 --> 00:53:12.156
Ask some of your friends' parents.

938
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.909
Thank you for coming in.

939
00:53:18.247 --> 00:53:21.499
Can you just send in the next person?
Thank you.

940
00:53:25.129 --> 00:53:26.754
You're up, hoss.

941
00:53:27.297 --> 00:53:29.841
Okay. Go. It's all right.

942
00:53:32.094 --> 00:53:34.387
Everything's gonna be okay.

943
00:53:40.853 --> 00:53:44.397
Don't you think it's a little strange
that your boyfriend is 22 years old...

944
00:53:44.565 --> 00:53:47.692
...and still in high school?
- Not that it's any of your business...

945
00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.235
...but he is here by choice.

946
00:53:49.403 --> 00:53:53.364
It's his choice he's a fourth-year senior
that can't pass any test he takes?

947
00:53:53.532 --> 00:53:55.867
His choice. His? His?

948
00:53:56.034 --> 00:53:57.076
Capital H?

949
00:53:57.244 --> 00:54:00.747
If God wanted him to graduate, God
would've given him the right answers.

950
00:54:04.126 --> 00:54:06.669
I'm sorry.
You gotta be shitting me, woman.

951
00:54:07.129 --> 00:54:09.589
Okay. So why was he blubbering
like a baby?

952
00:54:10.674 --> 00:54:14.260
- Is he struggling with his sexuality?
- No, you insensitive rhymes-with-witch.

953
00:54:14.428 --> 00:54:17.555
His parents are
going through a divorce.

954
00:54:20.976 --> 00:54:22.769
Okay.

955
00:54:29.568 --> 00:54:34.322
You know,
sometimes our boyfriend's parents...

956
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:35.948
...they get divorced, you know?

957
00:54:36.116 --> 00:54:40.077
And it's important to remember
it's not your fault.

958
00:54:40.245 --> 00:54:41.287
So I gotta go.

959
00:54:42.664 --> 00:54:47.210
But they go to our church.
What will people say?

960
00:54:51.507 --> 00:54:55.843
How long do these embraces usually
last? Because I gotta go, but l...

961
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:58.679
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, I'm gonna be okay.

962
00:54:58.847 --> 00:55:00.556
Mrs. Griffith is amazing...

963
00:55:00.724 --> 00:55:04.477
...and she's gonna help Micah,
and everything's gonna be okay.

964
00:55:05.604 --> 00:55:09.315
See? All right, that's the spirit.
Everything's gonna be okay.

965
00:55:09.483 --> 00:55:11.150
Okay.

966
00:55:15.572 --> 00:55:18.491
Wait. Why are you even
being so nice to me?

967
00:55:20.577 --> 00:55:22.495
I did it.

968
00:55:23.539 --> 00:55:24.622
I got through to you.

969
00:55:27.709 --> 00:55:30.628
I'm so sorry about everything I said.
I am so, so sorry.

970
00:55:30.796 --> 00:55:35.007
I mean, I really want us to be friends.
Can we please be friends?

971
00:55:35.843 --> 00:55:36.968
Absolutely.

972
00:55:40.138 --> 00:55:43.391
<i>And for a day,</i>
<i>we were actually really good friends.</i>

973
00:55:43.559 --> 00:55:46.477
<i>I was kind of starting to think</i>
<i>things were gonna turn around.</i>

974
00:55:46.645 --> 00:55:48.437
Olive!

975
00:55:48.605 --> 00:55:51.023
- Friend.
- Hey, friend.

976
00:55:51.191 --> 00:55:52.900
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you more.

977
00:55:53.068 --> 00:55:56.237
<i>She texted me in first period.</i>

978
00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.330
<i>By second period,</i>
<i>we apparently had private jokes.</i>

979
00:56:06.498 --> 00:56:08.708
Olive. Olive.

980
00:56:12.379 --> 00:56:14.630
<i>Tragedy struck in Wood Shop.</i>

981
00:56:14.798 --> 00:56:16.924
<i>It wasn't because</i>
<i>someone sawed off a thumb...</i>

982
00:56:17.092 --> 00:56:18.593
<i>... which has happened.</i>

983
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.637
Micah is in the hospital.
He is in so much pain.

984
00:56:21.805 --> 00:56:24.932
The nurse didn't know
what was wrong.

985
00:56:25.601 --> 00:56:27.602
There, there.

986
00:56:34.735 --> 00:56:36.986
It hurts so bad, Mommy.

987
00:56:37.154 --> 00:56:39.739
Well, it's just what I thought.
Chlamydia.

988
00:56:40.032 --> 00:56:41.365
No.

989
00:56:41.533 --> 00:56:45.119
Who have you been screwing?
Tell me.

990
00:56:45.287 --> 00:56:49.290
Tell me now
or I will kill you right here.

991
00:56:49.666 --> 00:56:52.793
Olive. Olive Penderghast!

992
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:58.716
Olive. Olive Penderghast.

993
00:56:58.884 --> 00:57:01.218
I have to call you back.
Okay. Bye-bye.

994
00:57:01.386 --> 00:57:03.596
Goddamn it.

995
00:57:05.933 --> 00:57:08.059
Chlamydia?!

996
00:57:10.312 --> 00:57:12.271
That bitch!

997
00:57:14.483 --> 00:57:16.067
- Olive?
- Hey.

998
00:57:18.153 --> 00:57:21.948
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Goddamn it.

999
00:57:24.034 --> 00:57:25.159
<i>I panicked.</i>

1000
00:57:25.327 --> 00:57:28.245
I said I got it
from Olive Penderghast.

1001
00:57:28.413 --> 00:57:31.540
I know, but what was
I supposed to say?

1002
00:57:31.708 --> 00:57:34.377
You know, and then my mom
tells Marianne's mom.

1003
00:57:34.544 --> 00:57:37.213
I did. I tried to blame it
on their divorce...

1004
00:57:37.381 --> 00:57:40.466
...but my mom is not buying it.

1005
00:57:41.009 --> 00:57:43.344
That's it. I have to tell them.

1006
00:57:43.512 --> 00:57:47.515
No, I do not care that you
gave me chlamydia. I don't!

1007
00:57:47.724 --> 00:57:52.228
I love you and I want to be with you,
and nobody can stop us.

1008
00:57:52.396 --> 00:57:56.273
<i>Not my mother, not Marianne,</i>
<i>and not even the school board...</i>

1009
00:57:56.441 --> 00:57:58.776
...or the president of the Americas!

1010
00:57:59.695 --> 00:58:03.364
Oh, God.

1011
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:10.955
What? What do you want?
What do you want?

1012
00:58:11.123 --> 00:58:12.707
Just go.

1013
00:58:15.961 --> 00:58:18.004
Perfect. Just perfect.

1014
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.799
I'm sorry, I just...
I was looking for Marianne.

1015
00:58:21.967 --> 00:58:23.926
Did she say anything
about being mad at me?

1016
00:58:24.094 --> 00:58:25.886
She just smacked
the bejesus out of me.

1017
00:58:26.054 --> 00:58:28.931
No, that's my fault.
I'm so sorry, Olive. I'm sorry.

1018
00:58:29.099 --> 00:58:32.977
But I messed up, okay?
I just goddamn shit...

1019
00:58:33.145 --> 00:58:37.648
...goddamn messed up
really goddamn shit bad.

1020
00:58:37.816 --> 00:58:39.734
Goddamn. Shit, goddamn.

1021
00:58:39.901 --> 00:58:44.030
Okay. Don't get me wrong
because I love it...

1022
00:58:44.197 --> 00:58:47.908
...but I don't think you're supposed to
use that language in front of a student.

1023
00:58:48.076 --> 00:58:51.078
You know what else you're not
supposed to do, is sleep with them.

1024
00:58:51.246 --> 00:58:53.497
But that didn't stop me. Goddamn shit.

1025
00:58:54.249 --> 00:58:57.001
Wait. You... Oh, my God.

1026
00:58:57.169 --> 00:59:00.588
But I'm not... I'm not judging
you or anything, but, oh, my God.

1027
00:59:00.756 --> 00:59:04.675
L... Wait, what does that
have to do with me?

1028
00:59:04.843 --> 00:59:06.927
You should know
that my marriage is not great.

1029
00:59:07.095 --> 00:59:08.763
We haven't slept together
in months.

1030
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:09.972
In months, all right?

1031
00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:14.185
Finally, this great-looking guy comes
in and he's nice to me, you know?

1032
00:59:14.352 --> 00:59:15.561
And he's not a minor.

1033
00:59:15.729 --> 00:59:19.940
This is legal. It's legal
because he's been here forever, okay?

1034
00:59:20.108 --> 00:59:22.902
He's not the sharpest
Christian in the Bible, all right?

1035
00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:26.280
And then he finds out
that he has chlamydia.

1036
00:59:26.448 --> 00:59:29.408
And so then he's telling
everybody that it was you.

1037
00:59:29.576 --> 00:59:31.285
He didn't want me
to lose my job...

1038
00:59:31.453 --> 00:59:34.872
...and he doesn't wanna get in trouble
either, so he said it's you.

1039
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.248
I'm sorry.

1040
00:59:37.459 --> 00:59:40.419
But I'Il... I'm gonna fix it, Olive.
Okay? I'll tell everyone.

1041
00:59:40.587 --> 00:59:45.466
I'm gonna tell everyone that it's me.
Okay? I'll just... I'll lose my job.

1042
00:59:45.967 --> 00:59:49.303
And, you know, whatever else I lose,
and then that's okay.

1043
00:59:52.974 --> 00:59:56.060
<i>Maybe it was becoming a habit</i>
<i>of mine to help the downtrodden...</i>

1044
00:59:56.228 --> 00:59:58.187
<i>... or maybe I just couldn't stand</i>
<i>to see...</i>

1045
00:59:58.355 --> 01:00:00.272
<i>... my favorite teacher's</i>
<i>marriage crumble.</i>

1046
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.650
<i>Either way, I decided to help.</i>

1047
01:00:03.151 --> 01:00:05.319
I could have chlamydia.

1048
01:00:06.863 --> 01:00:10.950
I mean, I could have easily given it
to Micah.

1049
01:00:11.118 --> 01:00:12.993
I mean, who knows?

1050
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:16.080
Women oftentimes
don't show symptoms.

1051
01:00:16.248 --> 01:00:18.582
And the whole world knows
I've been whoring around.

1052
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.292
No, you haven't. No, you haven't.

1053
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:25.798
Because a real whore can't admit it
to herself, much less others. Trust me.

1054
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.094
Call Micah.

1055
01:00:30.262 --> 01:00:33.639
Tell him he is an ass and
he owes me so big for this, but also...

1056
01:00:33.807 --> 01:00:36.642
...tell him I confessed
to giving him chlamydia.

1057
01:00:44.192 --> 01:00:46.694
Getting a lot of hugs today.

1058
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.822
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- Get out of here!

1059
01:00:52.409 --> 01:00:54.702
<i>I guess I shouldn't be too shocked</i>
<i>these people...</i>

1060
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:56.620
<i>... wanted my diseased ass</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

1061
01:00:56.788 --> 01:00:57.830
Save yourself, Olive.

1062
01:00:57.998 --> 01:01:00.833
<i>The funny thing is, the whole time</i>
<i>this all was going down...</i>

1063
01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:04.044
<i>... I couldn't help but think</i>
<i>I could've come up with better signs.</i>

1064
01:01:04.212 --> 01:01:06.046
<i>Although you gotta love</i>
<i>the Quiznos guy.</i>

1065
01:01:06.214 --> 01:01:09.383
<i>That's the one thing</i>
<i>that trumps religion: Capitalism.</i>

1066
01:01:09.551 --> 01:01:10.968
Why are you doing this?

1067
01:01:11.136 --> 01:01:13.262
I'm trying to make this school
a better place.

1068
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.723
Start a petition to get rid
of the lead paint.

1069
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:17.224
New Honey Chicken at Quiznos.

1070
01:01:17.392 --> 01:01:19.643
- Not now, Quiznos.
- You're a slut.

1071
01:01:19.811 --> 01:01:20.978
You're going down, Olive.

1072
01:01:21.146 --> 01:01:24.481
If this is because I'm more popular
than you, then I think what you're...

1073
01:01:24.649 --> 01:01:27.151
Let's not mistake popularity
for infamy.

1074
01:01:27.319 --> 01:01:30.196
- You don't wanna burn, do you?
- I'll be praying for you.

1075
01:01:35.243 --> 01:01:36.952
Sorry.

1076
01:01:37.579 --> 01:01:41.081
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm awesome. I'm awesome.

1077
01:01:41.249 --> 01:01:42.750
Screw all these people, Olive.

1078
01:01:42.918 --> 01:01:45.085
Haven't you heard?

1079
01:01:45.253 --> 01:01:47.421
I already did.

1080
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:50.591
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- What you're doing is wrong.

1081
01:01:50.926 --> 01:01:52.927
You're going to hell!

1082
01:01:57.766 --> 01:01:59.934
<i>So they got Rhiannon.</i>

1083
01:02:00.101 --> 01:02:03.354
<i>Never underestimate the power</i>
<i>of extremists like Marianne.</i>

1084
01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:07.274
<i>They sense any weakness,</i>
<i>they pounce like jungle cats.</i>

1085
01:02:07.442 --> 01:02:10.194
<i>And the whack pack</i>
<i>just gets bigger and bigger.</i>

1086
01:02:10.362 --> 01:02:12.446
<i>But at least they have a pack.</i>

1087
01:02:12.614 --> 01:02:16.492
<i>I was used to being by myself,</i>
<i>but I had never felt more alone.</i>

1088
01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.120
<i>I thought I should look into what they</i>
<i>were running around thumping about.</i>

1089
01:02:20.288 --> 01:02:22.581
- Do you have a religion section?
- It's over there.

1090
01:02:22.749 --> 01:02:24.750
- Can I help you with something?
- The Bible.

1091
01:02:24.918 --> 01:02:27.878
That's in bestsellers,
right next to Twilight.

1092
01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:31.840
<i>I didn't have time</i>
<i>to read the whole thing...</i>

1093
01:02:32.008 --> 01:02:33.550
<i>... because it's, like, 600 pages.</i>

1094
01:02:33.718 --> 01:02:35.219
<i>Single-spaced.</i>

1095
01:02:35.387 --> 01:02:37.972
<i>And as every war</i>
<i>that's ever been fought can tell you...</i>

1096
01:02:38.139 --> 01:02:40.140
<i>... there are many ways</i>
<i>you can interpret it.</i>

1097
01:02:40.308 --> 01:02:43.269
<i>Except the Civil War.</i>
<i>That was pure racism.</i>

1098
01:02:43.436 --> 01:02:44.770
<i>So I went to find an expert.</i>

1099
01:02:45.313 --> 01:02:49.316
<i>But really, I just kind of</i>
<i>wanted someone to talk to.</i>

1100
01:02:50.652 --> 01:02:54.321
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1101
01:02:54.823 --> 01:02:56.740
I think that's how you
start these things.

1102
01:02:56.908 --> 01:02:59.159
I'm just going off
what I've seen in movies.

1103
01:02:59.327 --> 01:03:01.370
Where do I even start?

1104
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.791
I've been pretending to be...

1105
01:03:05.959 --> 01:03:07.835
What is the Catholic way
of phrasing this?

1106
01:03:08.003 --> 01:03:09.837
A harlot?

1107
01:03:11.006 --> 01:03:14.675
A harlot. It's not that
I've actually been doing...

1108
01:03:14.843 --> 01:03:18.512
...the things that people have
been saying I've been doing...

1109
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.806
...but then again,
I'm not denying them either.

1110
01:03:20.974 --> 01:03:24.393
So I was just wondering,
is that wrong?

1111
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:29.523
It's just that a lot of people
have been asking me to do things...

1112
01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:35.863
...and I thought it was okay
because it wasn't real, you know?

1113
01:03:37.615 --> 01:03:39.783
It was make-believe.

1114
01:03:39.951 --> 01:03:42.369
And no one was getting hurt...

1115
01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:49.251
...but a lot of people hate me now.

1116
01:03:52.797 --> 01:03:55.257
I kind of hate me too.

1117
01:04:01.222 --> 01:04:03.432
I might be wrong...

1118
01:04:04.225 --> 01:04:06.226
...but aren't you
supposed to say something?

1119
01:04:06.394 --> 01:04:08.437
Tell me to say 10 Hail Marys,
pay a fine...

1120
01:04:08.605 --> 01:04:11.106
...advance token to nearest railroad?
Hello?

1121
01:04:13.401 --> 01:04:14.902
<i>Should've seen that one coming.</i>

1122
01:04:21.826 --> 01:04:25.204
<i>Luckily, I live in a town</i>
<i>with many different places of worship.</i>

1123
01:04:25.372 --> 01:04:27.915
<i>So I went to find one</i>
<i>with a real live human being.</i>

1124
01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:29.375
Can I help you?

1125
01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:32.169
Yeah, I was just wondering
if there's a minister around.

1126
01:04:32.837 --> 01:04:34.797
Is it not a minister?

1127
01:04:34.964 --> 01:04:37.007
A Reverend? A wizard?

1128
01:04:37.175 --> 01:04:39.051
It's a pastor, and he's here.

1129
01:04:40.678 --> 01:04:42.096
How can I help you today?

1130
01:04:42.263 --> 01:04:45.599
I was wondering what your church's
stance on lying and adultery was.

1131
01:04:45.767 --> 01:04:46.767
It's not a good thing.

1132
01:04:46.935 --> 01:04:51.271
Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly.
But, then... Now, tell me this.

1133
01:04:51.439 --> 01:04:52.856
Assuming there is a hell...

1134
01:04:53.024 --> 01:04:56.151
Oh, the Christian Church recognizes
the existence of hell.

1135
01:04:56.319 --> 01:04:58.612
Okay, so we'II just say
there's a "hell."

1136
01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.906
There is. Just so we're clear.

1137
01:05:01.074 --> 01:05:04.576
- Okay. So for argument's sake...
- No, there's no argument. It's there.

1138
01:05:04.744 --> 01:05:08.330
Right below our feet,
right above the Orient. It's there.

1139
01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:14.253
Then what would be worse,
lying or adultery?

1140
01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:17.131
Or is lying about adultery
just like double whammy? Sorry.

1141
01:05:17.298 --> 01:05:18.799
Come on.

1142
01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:23.637
I'm sorry,
what did you say your name was?

1143
01:05:24.347 --> 01:05:27.808
I didn't. L... You know what?
I'm just gonna...

1144
01:05:27.976 --> 01:05:30.310
I'm just gonna go check out
Judaism because...

1145
01:05:30.478 --> 01:05:32.479
- God. Two frames, really?
- Sorry.

1146
01:05:32.647 --> 01:05:34.773
The Jews and I have a lot in common.

1147
01:05:34.941 --> 01:05:37.693
- Just fashion-wise and stuff.
- Off you go.

1148
01:05:37.861 --> 01:05:40.904
<i>Yes, I had unwittingly sought advice</i>
<i>from the father...</i>

1149
01:05:41.072 --> 01:05:43.157
<i>... of the leader of my lynch mob.</i>

1150
01:05:43.324 --> 01:05:48.454
<i>What other complete and total idiot</i>
<i>can say that's happened to them?</i>

1151
01:05:51.291 --> 01:05:54.751
Okay, I've narrowed it down
<i>to The Other Boleyn Girl...</i>

1152
01:05:54.919 --> 01:05:57.588
...or The Bucket List. Huge hit.

1153
01:05:57.755 --> 01:06:00.674
Why can't we watch a movie for kids?
You always get to pick.

1154
01:06:00.842 --> 01:06:04.511
Because the Family Member
of the Week gets to pick the movie.

1155
01:06:04.679 --> 01:06:07.264
Yeah, but you get Family Member
of the Week every week.

1156
01:06:07.432 --> 01:06:08.932
And there's a reason for that.

1157
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.768
Yeah. You pick
Family Member of the Week.

1158
01:06:11.936 --> 01:06:13.437
Are you accusing me of nepotism?

1159
01:06:13.605 --> 01:06:17.149
Okay, it's The Bucket List.
This is it. This is the greatest decision.

1160
01:06:17.317 --> 01:06:20.444
I'm so happy with this decision.
That's what it's going to be.

1161
01:06:20.612 --> 01:06:23.572
All right, now, honey, after we watch
<i>The Bucket List...</i>

1162
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:28.285
...remember to cross "Watch
The Bucket List" off our bucket list.

1163
01:06:28.453 --> 01:06:29.495
Guys.

1164
01:06:29.662 --> 01:06:34.791
I want you to know that if you hear
I have chlamydia, that is totally false.

1165
01:06:34.959 --> 01:06:37.461
Olive, do we need
to have the talk again?

1166
01:06:37.629 --> 01:06:40.005
No. It's just a thing
that's going around.

1167
01:06:40.173 --> 01:06:43.050
You know, nothing you're saying
is making me feel any better.

1168
01:06:43.218 --> 01:06:45.886
Not to mention how you've been
dressing the last few days.

1169
01:06:46.054 --> 01:06:47.930
No judgment,
but you look like a stripper.

1170
01:06:48.097 --> 01:06:50.557
- Mom.
- A high-end stripper.

1171
01:06:50.725 --> 01:06:52.351
For governors or athletes.

1172
01:06:52.519 --> 01:06:53.852
But stripper, nonetheless.

1173
01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.688
Oh, my God.
I'm just trying to mix it up a little.

1174
01:06:56.856 --> 01:06:58.649
And I have no STDs, I promise you.

1175
01:06:58.816 --> 01:07:01.276
Oh, that's great.
Daughter of the Year.

1176
01:07:01.444 --> 01:07:03.237
If you hear anything
to the contrary...

1177
01:07:03.404 --> 01:07:05.614
...come up with some funny retort
and walk away.

1178
01:07:05.782 --> 01:07:08.575
Honey, you're kind of
starting to worry us a little.

1179
01:07:08.743 --> 01:07:10.744
Should we be kind of
worried a little?

1180
01:07:10.912 --> 01:07:12.746
I don't think so.

1181
01:07:12.914 --> 01:07:15.874
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1182
01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:18.919
Yeah. I got it all under control.

1183
01:07:20.129 --> 01:07:21.171
- Okay.
- Okay.

1184
01:07:21.339 --> 01:07:23.507
Then let's Bucket List this bitch.

1185
01:07:23.675 --> 01:07:25.509
<i>The Bucket List, The Bucket List.</i>

1186
01:07:25.677 --> 01:07:28.053
To say this whole thing
had taken over my life...

1187
01:07:28.221 --> 01:07:30.681
...would be
a colossal understatement.

1188
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:34.101
I actually reread The Scarlet Letter
<i>to see how Hester dealt with it.</i>

1189
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:39.106
<i>And it turns out she bore</i>
<i>her punishment in humble silence...</i>

1190
01:07:39.274 --> 01:07:42.442
...which are two concepts
I am not comfortable with.

1191
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:44.820
<i>With all the mythical play</i>
<i>I was getting...</i>

1192
01:07:44.988 --> 01:07:47.990
<i>... I still actually hadn't been</i>
<i>asked out on a real date.</i>

1193
01:07:48.157 --> 01:07:51.243
<i>People were jumping up and down</i>
<i>to say they'd slept with me...</i>

1194
01:07:51.411 --> 01:07:53.870
<i>... but no one bothered</i>
<i>really trying to sleep with me.</i>

1195
01:07:54.038 --> 01:07:56.957
<i>I was starting to think I actually did</i>
<i>have a gnome down there.</i>

1196
01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:59.501
<i>- Until finally...</i>
- Hey, Olive.

1197
01:08:00.128 --> 01:08:01.878
Hey, Anson. What's up?

1198
01:08:02.046 --> 01:08:04.172
I was wondering
if you were busy tonight.

1199
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.259
Maybe wanna go out or something?

1200
01:08:08.428 --> 01:08:09.886
What did you have in mind?

1201
01:08:10.054 --> 01:08:12.764
I was thinking about getting
a hot-air balloon, you know...

1202
01:08:12.932 --> 01:08:14.641
...bringing along some champagne...

1203
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:18.145
...and then possibly reading
some Sylvia Plath.

1204
01:08:18.313 --> 01:08:21.690
Or we could just go
to The Lobster Shack...

1205
01:08:21.858 --> 01:08:23.900
...because it's, you know,
a little easier.

1206
01:08:24.068 --> 01:08:27.195
- I love The Lobster Shack.
- Good.

1207
01:08:27.363 --> 01:08:28.822
Okay. It's a date, then.

1208
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:32.576
- Okay.
- Okay.

1209
01:08:34.287 --> 01:08:37.039
So should I still bring
the Sylvia Plath or?

1210
01:08:37.206 --> 01:08:39.166
No, we could stick our heads
in the oven...

1211
01:08:39.334 --> 01:08:41.418
...if we run out of things
to talk about.

1212
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:43.170
That was...

1213
01:08:43.338 --> 01:08:45.297
- Cool. All right. Well...
- Cool.

1214
01:08:54.182 --> 01:08:55.474
You look really beautiful.

1215
01:08:55.642 --> 01:08:57.351
Thank you.

1216
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.229
- You're a real gentleman.
- No.

1217
01:09:01.397 --> 01:09:05.901
Just a guy having dinner with a girl.

1218
01:09:17.163 --> 01:09:20.707
Do you believe this whole thing
about lobster being an aphrodisiac?

1219
01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:23.377
I did not know it was.

1220
01:09:23.544 --> 01:09:26.004
Medical science really
has not substantiated claims...

1221
01:09:26.172 --> 01:09:29.383
...that any particular food increases
sexual desire or performance...

1222
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:32.386
...but guys just spend and spend
to ply women with food...

1223
01:09:32.553 --> 01:09:36.056
...they think is gonna get them lucky.
Which is funny, because, it's like...

1224
01:09:36.224 --> 01:09:39.309
...what is sexy about
slurping back oysters? Nothing.

1225
01:09:39.477 --> 01:09:43.063
Did you know some people actually
eat ground-up rhinoceros horn...

1226
01:09:43.231 --> 01:09:46.274
...because it's thought to increase
the size of the male sex organ?

1227
01:09:46.442 --> 01:09:48.402
That's not true at all.

1228
01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:51.196
Spanish fly. Spanish fly.
You've heard of this? Yes?

1229
01:09:51.364 --> 01:09:52.906
- Yes.
- Okay. That thing?

1230
01:09:53.074 --> 01:09:55.200
Pulverized blister beetle. What?

1231
01:09:55.368 --> 01:09:58.912
And it's illegal in the U.S. Because
if you eat just a little bit too much...

1232
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.249
...it causes painful urination,
fever and bloody discharge.

1233
01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:03.792
- Am I talking too much?
- No.

1234
01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.670
You're just burning through
a lot of topics really fast.

1235
01:10:06.838 --> 01:10:09.673
Shouldn't have had coffee
three weeks ago.

1236
01:10:09.841 --> 01:10:10.882
I'm just kidding.

1237
01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:14.886
Your Maine lobster
with crab and seafood stuffing.

1238
01:10:16.264 --> 01:10:18.181
- I'm jealous.
- Thank you.

1239
01:10:18.975 --> 01:10:21.226
Let's dig in. Right?

1240
01:10:25.356 --> 01:10:27.816
I didn't know Woodchuck Todd
worked here.

1241
01:10:35.366 --> 01:10:36.658
He's dressed like a lobster.

1242
01:10:36.826 --> 01:10:39.745
I should start calling him
Lobster Todd.

1243
01:10:45.418 --> 01:10:46.626
Shit.

1244
01:10:46.794 --> 01:10:48.587
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What? What's wrong?

1245
01:10:48.755 --> 01:10:50.255
- Rhiannon's over there.
- So?

1246
01:10:50.423 --> 01:10:52.674
She's been in love with you
since 1 st grade.

1247
01:10:52.842 --> 01:10:55.385
- She's my best friend.
- I thought you weren't speaking.

1248
01:10:55.553 --> 01:10:57.888
But that doesn't mean
she's not my best friend.

1249
01:10:58.055 --> 01:10:59.598
Or that I should be out with you.

1250
01:10:59.766 --> 01:11:02.142
Rhi and I don't have
anything in common.

1251
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.060
- And you and I do?
- Yeah.

1252
01:11:04.228 --> 01:11:07.314
- Like what?
- Like I hate Marianne Bryant too.

1253
01:11:07.482 --> 01:11:10.317
If that's our connection,
I should date the entire school.

1254
01:11:10.485 --> 01:11:12.235
Haven't you?

1255
01:11:13.446 --> 01:11:15.989
No. No, I haven't.

1256
01:11:19.368 --> 01:11:21.077
Okay, she can't see us.
Check. Check.

1257
01:11:21.245 --> 01:11:23.538
Can you just...? Excuse me? Hi.

1258
01:11:24.165 --> 01:11:28.043
I just remembered
I am so allergic to shellfish.

1259
01:11:28.211 --> 01:11:30.504
I forget that my respiratory system
will collapse.

1260
01:11:30.671 --> 01:11:32.923
- I have a gift certificate. Keep the tip.
- Thanks.

1261
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:34.633
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

1262
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:37.552
- Go. Go. Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

1263
01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.304
Go, go, go.

1264
01:11:47.313 --> 01:11:49.356
I'm sorry about that.

1265
01:11:51.651 --> 01:11:54.069
I've got something for you.

1266
01:11:55.446 --> 01:11:57.697
Two hundred dollars
to The Home Depot.

1267
01:12:04.288 --> 01:12:05.622
I didn't realize this was a...

1268
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:09.543
I know it sounds kind of lame, but they
really do have some awesome stuff.

1269
01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:12.212
I bought my air compressor there.

1270
01:12:13.714 --> 01:12:16.383
So, what did we do on this date?

1271
01:12:16.551 --> 01:12:18.134
Whatever 200 bucks gets me.

1272
01:12:20.555 --> 01:12:23.598
- That's not really how it works.
- It's okay.

1273
01:12:24.392 --> 01:12:25.892
Stop.

1274
01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.728
I'm not really having sex with people
for money.

1275
01:12:28.896 --> 01:12:32.858
I'm saying I'm having sex for money,
but I'm not having sex for money.

1276
01:12:33.025 --> 01:12:34.693
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

1277
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:36.528
- Stop. No, no.
- What?

1278
01:12:36.696 --> 01:12:37.946
Stop!

1279
01:12:38.114 --> 01:12:40.699
Come on, just relax. Come on, babe.
It's all right.

1280
01:12:40.867 --> 01:12:43.952
God. Asshole.

1281
01:12:48.124 --> 01:12:51.376
What are you doing? I paid you.

1282
01:12:52.295 --> 01:12:54.254
Now you didn't.

1283
01:12:56.257 --> 01:12:59.259
Come on, this is bullshit.

1284
01:13:03.598 --> 01:13:05.473
Goddamn it.

1285
01:13:06.684 --> 01:13:08.435
Hey, Olive.

1286
01:13:09.854 --> 01:13:11.730
Todd, hi.

1287
01:13:17.111 --> 01:13:20.488
- Hey, you all right?
- I just have something in my eye.

1288
01:13:20.656 --> 01:13:24.034
Like a twig, you know, or a branch,
or a contact, or something.

1289
01:13:24.201 --> 01:13:28.455
- I didn't know you wore contacts.
- I don't, which is why I was tearing up.

1290
01:13:29.206 --> 01:13:33.335
Olive, hey. Let me drive you home.

1291
01:13:41.385 --> 01:13:44.137
Do you wanna talk about it?

1292
01:13:47.642 --> 01:13:51.895
What's to say?
Everybody thinks I'm a whore...

1293
01:13:52.688 --> 01:13:55.273
...and for the first time,
I'm starting to believe it.

1294
01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:56.483
What?

1295
01:13:56.651 --> 01:13:59.486
Don't act like you don't know
what people are saying about me.

1296
01:13:59.654 --> 01:14:02.489
I know what people are saying.
Doesn't mean I believe them.

1297
01:14:02.657 --> 01:14:04.491
- Who told you?
- No one.

1298
01:14:04.659 --> 01:14:07.911
No one had to tell me that once upon
a time, there was a scared kid...

1299
01:14:08.079 --> 01:14:11.915
...at a party in a dark room
who was not ready for his first kiss.

1300
01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:16.544
And, you know, there was
this amazing girl who lied for him.

1301
01:14:16.712 --> 01:14:19.631
I still can't believe
you remember that.

1302
01:14:22.885 --> 01:14:25.929
You know, sometimes I pretend
you were my first real kiss.

1303
01:14:27.348 --> 01:14:29.015
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1304
01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:32.852
- Who was?
- It was Rhiannon.

1305
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.729
- What?
- She must have told you.

1306
01:14:34.897 --> 01:14:39.109
Yeah, it was... I think it was, like,
a year after that or something.

1307
01:14:39.276 --> 01:14:42.112
It sucked, by the way.
She was, like:

1308
01:14:42.279 --> 01:14:44.531
That bitch.

1309
01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:47.409
Oh, my God,
she knew how I felt about you.

1310
01:14:47.576 --> 01:14:50.453
- How do you feel about me?
- And here I am feeling so bad.

1311
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:51.830
That's just perfect.

1312
01:14:51.998 --> 01:14:54.374
Wait, hold on a second.
How do you feel about me?

1313
01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:56.292
"Felt."

1314
01:14:56.669 --> 01:14:58.044
I said "felt."

1315
01:14:59.839 --> 01:15:03.133
Because I thought l...
I thought I heard "feel."

1316
01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.926
- No, it was "felt."
- All right.

1317
01:15:05.094 --> 01:15:07.137
How do you know where I live?

1318
01:15:07.304 --> 01:15:08.638
We used to carpool.

1319
01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.475
Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you
like a savant for people's addresses?

1320
01:15:12.643 --> 01:15:14.728
Just for people who I think are cool.

1321
01:15:15.396 --> 01:15:17.564
- You think I'm cool?
- I do.

1322
01:15:17.732 --> 01:15:21.026
And I think you're pretty and smart.

1323
01:15:21.318 --> 01:15:24.112
Did you form this opinion
prior to my little transformation?

1324
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.947
Way prior.

1325
01:15:27.324 --> 01:15:29.159
Why didn't that rumor spread?

1326
01:15:29.618 --> 01:15:31.369
I like to keep my business to myself.

1327
01:15:31.537 --> 01:15:33.538
Notoriety, for whatever reason...

1328
01:15:33.706 --> 01:15:36.583
...never seems to benefit the noted,
it's only the "notees."

1329
01:15:38.335 --> 01:15:39.919
Where were you two weeks ago?

1330
01:15:44.842 --> 01:15:46.009
Olive.

1331
01:15:47.219 --> 01:15:52.057
If I promise not to tell anyone,
could I kiss you right now?

1332
01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:57.520
No.

1333
01:15:59.565 --> 01:16:01.775
- Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- Oh, no.

1334
01:16:01.942 --> 01:16:04.069
I just mean, not like this.

1335
01:16:04.236 --> 01:16:07.113
I don't wanna kiss you with mascara
running down my face...

1336
01:16:07.281 --> 01:16:09.783
...and some horndog guy
just having tried...

1337
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:12.994
...to stick his tongue
down my throat.

1338
01:16:14.121 --> 01:16:16.581
I've wanted to kiss you
since 8th grade...

1339
01:16:17.583 --> 01:16:19.918
...but I want it to be perfect.

1340
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.588
And right now, my life is a mess.

1341
01:16:24.006 --> 01:16:27.342
I need to get my business in order
before I drag you into it.

1342
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:29.803
What if I told you
I wanna be dragged into it?

1343
01:16:30.763 --> 01:16:32.347
I could help, maybe.

1344
01:17:01.127 --> 01:17:02.293
Why now?

1345
01:17:03.462 --> 01:17:05.463
Why are you all of a sudden
into me now?

1346
01:17:05.631 --> 01:17:06.756
I don't know.

1347
01:17:07.216 --> 01:17:10.635
I haven't overanalyzed it,
like you're about to.

1348
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:18.726
- Good night, Olive.
- Good night, Lobster Todd.

1349
01:17:20.688 --> 01:17:24.107
<i>Now that I knew there were decent</i>
<i>and goodhearted people out there...</i>

1350
01:17:24.275 --> 01:17:25.859
<i>... the lies had to stop.</i>

1351
01:17:26.026 --> 01:17:29.529
<i>I knew there was only one person I
<i>could count on to set the story straight:</i>

1352
01:17:29.697 --> 01:17:30.697
<i>Brandon.</i>

1353
01:17:30.865 --> 01:17:34.117
<i>I'd helped him, and even though</i>
<i>it would destroy his new reputation...</i>

1354
01:17:34.285 --> 01:17:36.828
<i>... as a straight stud,</i>
<i>I knew he'd help me.</i>

1355
01:17:36.996 --> 01:17:39.622
Oh, my God. Did you hear that
Brandon ran away from home?

1356
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:43.209
Yeah, totally. He left his parents
a note that said, "I'm gay, bitches"...

1357
01:17:43.377 --> 01:17:46.546
...and then he skipped town
with some big, hulking black guy.

1358
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.340
My apologies to Mark Twain.

1359
01:17:49.508 --> 01:17:50.592
- Wait, huh?
- What?

1360
01:17:50.759 --> 01:17:52.719
- You said something.
- You said something.

1361
01:17:52.887 --> 01:17:54.762
You said something,
so I came back.

1362
01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:56.389
- You're funny. Okay.
- Call me.

1363
01:17:56.557 --> 01:17:59.726
<i>I went to everyone I'd helped</i>
<i>and begged them to say it wasn't true.</i>

1364
01:17:59.894 --> 01:18:02.061
No way. I gave you money.

1365
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:05.857
You gave me a gift card to AutoZone.
I don't even have a car.

1366
01:18:06.025 --> 01:18:07.817
I thought it'd be aspirational.

1367
01:18:07.985 --> 01:18:12.197
Evan, please do this for me, all right?
I did that for you. Do this for me.

1368
01:18:12.364 --> 01:18:15.283
I don't want people to know
I didn't go to second base with you.

1369
01:18:15.451 --> 01:18:18.453
Do you know how many girls
I've hooked up with because of that?

1370
01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:20.163
Girls are almost as dumb as boys.

1371
01:18:20.331 --> 01:18:23.041
Oh, yes, they are.

1372
01:18:26.545 --> 01:18:27.921
<i>It gets worse.</i>

1373
01:18:28.088 --> 01:18:29.714
"Honor your father
and your mother."

1374
01:18:29.882 --> 01:18:33.301
<i>Due to his condition, Micah was sent</i>
<i>on a visit to his grandparents...</i>

1375
01:18:33.469 --> 01:18:34.928
<i>... in Palatka, Florida.</i>

1376
01:18:35.095 --> 01:18:38.264
<i>And if there's one thing worse</i>
<i>than chlamydia, it's Florida.</i>

1377
01:18:38.432 --> 01:18:40.225
"...be guilty of adultery."

1378
01:18:40.392 --> 01:18:42.435
Get your hands
out of your berries, boy.

1379
01:18:42.603 --> 01:18:44.604
<i>Olive, life is full of choices.</i>

1380
01:18:44.772 --> 01:18:48.024
I made a bad one.
But then, so did you.

1381
01:18:48.192 --> 01:18:51.527
But I see no other alternative
than to just live with the guilt.

1382
01:18:51.695 --> 01:18:55.031
My guilt stems from my indiscretion
and yours for lying.

1383
01:18:55.616 --> 01:18:59.327
We made our choices.
Now, we just have to let it ride.

1384
01:18:59.495 --> 01:19:03.790
Or I could just tell everyone the truth
and get you fired and put in jail.

1385
01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:06.584
Okay, first of all, he is of age, okay?

1386
01:19:06.752 --> 01:19:08.962
It's perfectly legal
in the state of California.

1387
01:19:09.129 --> 01:19:11.714
I checked. He is 21 in eight months.

1388
01:19:11.882 --> 01:19:14.801
And secondly, let's play the Who
Would You Believe game, okay?

1389
01:19:14.969 --> 01:19:18.346
Why don't you ask yourself, if you
were an adult, who would you believe?

1390
01:19:18.514 --> 01:19:20.598
Who would you believe?
Who would you believe?

1391
01:19:20.766 --> 01:19:22.934
Who would you believe? Who?

1392
01:19:27.648 --> 01:19:29.857
Thank you for coming in.

1393
01:19:33.195 --> 01:19:37.573
<i>Yeah, Mrs. Griffith was pure evil, but</i>
<i>I still shouldn't have done what I did.</i>

1394
01:19:37.741 --> 01:19:40.535
Your wife has chlamydia,
and she's sleeping with a student...

1395
01:19:40.703 --> 01:19:43.329
...and she gave it to him,
and she's trying to blame me.

1396
01:19:44.665 --> 01:19:46.207
What?

1397
01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:56.009
I'm sorry.

1398
01:19:56.802 --> 01:19:59.262
Mr. Griffith, if you ever see this...

1399
01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:05.351
...just know that I was wrong
to tell you that in that way. At all.

1400
01:20:05.686 --> 01:20:07.562
I shouldn't have done it.

1401
01:20:08.022 --> 01:20:10.690
<i>And I don't even feel bad</i>
<i>for lying for your wife.</i>

1402
01:20:10.858 --> 01:20:16.362
<i>But I hate myself for telling you</i>
<i>the truth. I am so sorry.</i>

1403
01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:20.658
<i>With my words, even though</i>
<i>they were true, I ended a marriage.</i>

1404
01:20:20.868 --> 01:20:25.288
<i>Looking back, that's the thing</i>
<i>I regret the most.</i>

1405
01:20:31.754 --> 01:20:37.133
So now everyone that knows the truth
is either gone or they won't fess up.

1406
01:20:37.301 --> 01:20:42.305
And Marianne Bryant and her
disciples are demanding my head.

1407
01:20:42.473 --> 01:20:46.059
The messed-up thing is I would not put
it past Principal Gibbons to expel me.

1408
01:20:46.226 --> 01:20:48.394
I had a similar situation
when I was your age.

1409
01:20:48.562 --> 01:20:50.229
What? Everyone called you a slut?

1410
01:20:50.397 --> 01:20:53.483
I had a horrible reputation and
people said awful things about me.

1411
01:20:53.984 --> 01:20:55.902
- Why?
- Because I was a slut.

1412
01:20:56.070 --> 01:21:00.490
I slept with a whole bunch of people.
A slew, a heap, a peck. Mostly guys.

1413
01:21:00.657 --> 01:21:02.950
- Mom.
- Sorry, I got around.

1414
01:21:03.118 --> 01:21:06.120
Before I met Dad,
I had incredibly low self-worth.

1415
01:21:06.288 --> 01:21:09.874
Do me a favor and just stuff this down
my throat until I asphyxiate to death.

1416
01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:12.543
- It's true. It is.
- I want to die.

1417
01:21:12.711 --> 01:21:15.046
It's true.
I was quite the contortionist.

1418
01:21:15.214 --> 01:21:18.257
I could do this thing. I could go...
I mean, my leg all the way...

1419
01:21:18.425 --> 01:21:20.718
Stop. Can you stop?
Don't show me.

1420
01:21:20.886 --> 01:21:23.971
- Can you not see that I'm a mess?
- No, you're not, Olive.

1421
01:21:24.139 --> 01:21:25.890
You're wonderful.

1422
01:21:26.433 --> 01:21:28.601
And you'll handle this
the same way I did.

1423
01:21:28.769 --> 01:21:31.229
With an incontrovertible
sense of humor.

1424
01:21:32.523 --> 01:21:34.941
But you're much smarter than I am...

1425
01:21:35.109 --> 01:21:38.194
...so you'll come out of this
much better than I did.

1426
01:21:40.948 --> 01:21:42.115
Thank you, Mom.

1427
01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:47.954
- I could get my leg so far back.
- No, no, no. Stop it.

1428
01:21:48.122 --> 01:21:50.957
<i>So it was time to put an end</i>
<i>to all this once and for all...</i>

1429
01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:52.750
<i>... by telling my side of the story.</i>

1430
01:21:52.918 --> 01:21:55.044
<i>And that's why I decided</i>
<i>to do this webcast.</i>

1431
01:21:55.212 --> 01:21:57.505
So here we go.

1432
01:21:59.133 --> 01:22:00.800
Part five.

1433
01:22:00.968 --> 01:22:03.094
Not with a fizzle, but with a bang.

1434
01:22:03.262 --> 01:22:07.140
<i>Today we had yet another</i>
<i>one of our ridiculous pep rallies.</i>

1435
01:22:07.307 --> 01:22:10.476
<i>Todd convinced the band to play</i>
<i>the sexiest song in their repertoire.</i>

1436
01:22:10.644 --> 01:22:14.230
<i>I needed to pique everyone's interest</i>
<i>to get them to go home and log on.</i>

1437
01:22:14.398 --> 01:22:17.775
<i>I had one outfit left and I figured</i>
<i>about 30 seconds to do it.</i>

1438
01:22:17.943 --> 01:22:20.695
<i>Plus I really wanted</i>
<i>my own awesome musical number...</i>

1439
01:22:21.321 --> 01:22:23.364
<i>... for no apparent reason.</i>

1440
01:22:28.078 --> 01:22:29.328
Is that Olive?

1441
01:23:53.914 --> 01:23:55.790
This was just a free preview.

1442
01:23:55.958 --> 01:24:01.587
For the main event, log on to
www.FreeOlive.com tonight at 6 p.m.

1443
01:24:01.755 --> 01:24:05.007
And I know it interferes with
the basketball game but, come on...

1444
01:24:05.175 --> 01:24:07.260
...would you rather cheer on
the Woodchucks...

1445
01:24:07.427 --> 01:24:09.637
...or watch me do one?

1446
01:24:11.139 --> 01:24:14.392
What do you think you're doing?
Get to my office right now.

1447
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.187
I can't, because I have a date with the
guy I like and the rest of the school.

1448
01:24:18.355 --> 01:24:21.566
I think before you expel me,
you might wanna talk to Mrs. Griffith...

1449
01:24:21.733 --> 01:24:24.443
...because I think she might
talk you into letting me stay.

1450
01:24:24.611 --> 01:24:27.113
Go, Woodchucks!

1451
01:24:37.082 --> 01:24:39.584
And here you all are...

1452
01:24:39.751 --> 01:24:42.628
...waiting outside the bedroom door
for me to kiss Todd...

1453
01:24:42.796 --> 01:24:45.339
<i>... listening to me pretend</i>
<i>to have sex with Brandon...</i>

1454
01:24:45.507 --> 01:24:47.717
<i>... paying me to lie for you...</i>

1455
01:24:47.884 --> 01:24:49.927
<i>... and calling me</i>
<i>every name in the book.</i>

1456
01:24:50.137 --> 01:24:52.888
<i>You know, it was just like Hester</i>
in The Scarlet Letter.

1457
01:24:53.056 --> 01:24:55.558
<i>Except that's the one thing</i>
<i>the movies don't tell you:</i>

1458
01:24:55.726 --> 01:25:00.938
How shitty it feels to be an outcast.
Warranted or not.

1459
01:25:10.282 --> 01:25:12.199
How did you know I love this song?

1460
01:25:12.367 --> 01:25:13.659
I guessed.

1461
01:25:13.827 --> 01:25:17.246
I see you've been watching my live
webcast. It's still going on, you know.

1462
01:25:17.414 --> 01:25:20.791
Screw them. They've had
enough of you. Figuratively speaking.

1463
01:25:20.959 --> 01:25:23.961
I borrowed my neighbor's mower.
I came right over.

1464
01:25:24.129 --> 01:25:25.171
That almost rhymed.

1465
01:25:25.339 --> 01:25:27.882
I know. I spent a minute on it.

1466
01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:30.051
I'll be right down.

1467
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.512
That's Todd.

1468
01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.643
Not that I owe you guys any more
confessions, but I really like this guy...

1469
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:43.064
<i>... and I might even lose my virginity</i>
<i>to him.</i>

1470
01:25:43.732 --> 01:25:45.650
I don't know when it'II happen.

1471
01:25:45.817 --> 01:25:48.861
You know, it might be five minutes
from now or tonight...

1472
01:25:49.446 --> 01:25:52.948
...or six months from now
or maybe on our wedding night.

1473
01:25:53.116 --> 01:25:57.995
But the really amazing thing is,
it is nobody's goddamn business.

1474
01:26:00.374 --> 01:26:01.749
Come on, where's she going?

1475
01:26:01.917 --> 01:26:04.126
I thought she was going
to take her clothes off.

1476
01:26:04.294 --> 01:26:06.837
Demi Moore took her clothes off.
This is bullshit.

1477
01:26:07.005 --> 01:26:10.466
Come on. Are you kidding me?

1478
01:26:12.427 --> 01:26:15.179
- Piss off.
- Come here, you punk.

1479
01:26:18.225 --> 01:26:19.725
Jack?

1480
01:26:47.504 --> 01:26:49.922
<i>That's a mighty snug little shelter,</i>
<i>Huck.</i>

1481
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:51.549
<i>I judge it's all right.</i>

1482
01:26:51.717 --> 01:26:53.759
<i>Here, Jim, I'll take my turn</i>
<i>at steering now.</i>

1483
01:26:53.927 --> 01:26:56.303
<i>No, that's all right, Huck.</i>
<i>I like steering.</i>

1484
01:27:39.264 --> 01:27:41.140
Blue Devils!
