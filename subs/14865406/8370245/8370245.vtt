the bubbles.

It's not the bubbles, remember,
it's the sound they make.

with a tiger shark!

do you wanna do that all alone,
or with Jackson?

to commit to the man I love?

You should call her back.

That'll just make it worse.

174
00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:28.458
Just text her back,
"Whatever I said,

176
00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:32.250

Jose, remember 20 minutes
and it's dark, okay?

530
00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:43.333
[in Spanish] I know. I know, all right?

531
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.708
-[in English] You stay close to me.

532
00:43:46.792 --> 00:43:49.250

[motorcycle engine roars]

546
00:48:17.917 --> 00:48:19.167
She was frantic when she called.

547
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:22.083
There was definitely someone else
on the boat. She's been in the same place

548
00:48:22.167 --> 00:48:23.750
-for way too long.
-But she just called.

549
00:48:23.833 --> 00:48:25.917
She's alive. This is good.
Just call her back.

550
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.750
The phone is dead. No answer.

551
00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:30.375
Sometimes these satellite phones
are not very reliable.

552
00:48:30.458 --> 00:48:31.583
Especially in this weather.

553
00:48:31.667 --> 00:48:34.250
No, it's not that!
Something is wrong, I know it.

554
00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:36.542
-What do you want me to do?
-Send a search team now!

555
00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:38.625
Naomi's in trouble. Please!

556
00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:41.750
Young man, based on what?
She isn't missing. You just spoke to her.

557
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:44.542
She called because
she's in distress!

558
00:48:44.625 --> 00:48:47.250
And you tell me the reason she stopped
was because she saw survivors?

559
00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:48.917
-floating on debris?
-Yes!

560
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.917
There has been no alerts
for or from any ships in the area.

561
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.958
-[bangs desk]
-You need to do something!

562
00:48:54.042 --> 00:48:55.333
[second officer] Everything okay?

563
00:48:56.875 --> 00:48:59.375
I have a few colleagues
in the surrounding islands.

564
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:02.458
I can make a few phone calls
but that's the best I can do.

565
00:49:02.542 --> 00:49:05.042
Until she's been missing
for more than 24 hours,

566
00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:07.625
I cannot make any kind of
distress classification.

567
00:49:07.708 --> 00:49:09.250
I am sorry, my hands are tied!

568
00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:12.583

Come on!

-[thud]
-Fuck's sake!

600
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.083
What do you mean what happened
to the bags?

601
00:55:13.167 --> 00:55:15.458
Where are the
fucking bags?

602
00:55:15.542 --> 00:55:17.417
On the trawler deck.

603
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.167
The shark bit into the bags

604
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:22.958
and now the shark is probably
high on cocaine.

605
00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:25.583
We go back down
right now. <i>Vamos!</i>

606
00:55:25.667 --> 00:55:27.333
-Forget it. I'm done.
-No, no, no.

607
00:55:27.417 --> 00:55:30.625
Nothing is done till I say it is done!
You get it?

608
00:55:30.708 --> 00:55:33.042
[Naomi] You were underwater
for way too long

609
00:55:33.125 --> 00:55:37.542
and I can only do two dives
at that depth.

610
00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:40.625
I know you don't give a fuck
about me, but you won't survive.

611
00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:41.833
Okay, she's right.

612
00:55:41.917 --> 00:55:43.917
And we need her
to take us to the Keys.

613
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.750
I don't care about
the fucking Keys!

614
00:55:45.833 --> 00:55:47.917
Wait, well I've made
my decision!

615
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.625
You two go back down tomorrow
in the morning.

616
00:55:50.708 --> 00:55:55.167
The crew on your boat.
They were shot.

617
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:58.667
Well, um, it happens
in our business.

618
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:02.208
They got greedy, you know?
They wanted our drugs.

619
00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:05.625
So Tomas and Jose
had to deal with them.

620
00:56:09.167 --> 00:56:11.583
The explosion didn't happen
in the engine room.

621
00:56:11.667 --> 00:56:16.583
[scoffs] What kind of an idiot
brings grenades onto a boat?

622
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:19.708
[Jose] Yeah.
[in Spanish] A fucking dead idiot.

623
00:56:19.792 --> 00:56:21.500
[in English] I need to raise the anchor.

624
00:56:21.583 --> 00:56:23.917
-[Maria] Why?
-[Jose] Why?

625
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.708
‘Cause you cannot be anchored
in a storm.

626
00:56:26.792 --> 00:56:30.625
No! We're not going to fall into
one of your tricks again!

627
00:56:32.292 --> 00:56:33.875
A swell can breach the deck

628
00:56:33.958 --> 00:56:36.208
and the boat will
fill with water!

629
00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:37.708
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. No!

630
00:56:37.792 --> 00:56:40.042
[Jose] We're already tied
up onto that stuff.

631
00:56:40.125 --> 00:56:43.125
The boat stays right here,
next to the trawler.

632
00:56:43.208 --> 00:56:44.625
Do you understand?

633
00:56:45.542 --> 00:56:47.125
Do you understand?

634
00:56:47.208 --> 00:56:50.958
Exactly. The boat
stays right here.

635
00:56:52.333 --> 00:56:54.500

-[woman] What do you want?
-I need to see your husband.

640
00:57:15.167 --> 00:57:17.875
You're gonna have to wait.
He's busy with a potential client.

641
00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:19.833
-It can't wait, it's important.
-No way.

642
00:57:19.917 --> 00:57:22.500
-Come back later.
-I'll be quick. Wait here.

643
00:57:22.583 --> 00:57:23.667
Jack!

644
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.250
We will fly to the South side.

645
00:57:25.333 --> 00:57:28.167
This coast is especially lovely
this time of the year.

646
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:29.917
-[footsteps]
-That's good.

647
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.125
Hey, my friend!
This is Jackson Taylor,

648
00:57:32.208 --> 00:57:34.708
co-owner and operator of the best
sailing yacht in the Caribbean.

649
00:57:34.792 --> 00:57:36.958
Hi. Can I have a word please?

650
00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:39.625
Yes, sure, of course.

651
00:57:39.708 --> 00:57:41.042
Please, sit down.

652
00:57:41.125 --> 00:57:42.625
I want you to watch this video

653
00:57:42.708 --> 00:57:45.042
and picture yourself flying
over the majestic paradise,

654
00:57:45.125 --> 00:57:47.667
while I attend to Mr. Taylor.
Just a moment, yeah?

655
00:57:52.292 --> 00:57:55.500
Jack, I hope this is important. I haven't
had a charter for over two weeks.

656
00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:57.417
Naomi was on her way back here.

657
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.042
She came across a wreckage and survivors
in the sea west of Martinique.

658
00:58:01.125 --> 00:58:04.250
There's a squall heading that way as well.
Something's wrong.

659
00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:06.458
Serenity's been in the same
spot for a very long time.

660
00:58:06.542 --> 00:58:08.458
She's not responding
to her radio.

661
00:58:08.542 --> 00:58:09.958
This isn't like her.

662
00:58:10.042 --> 00:58:12.625
-When did you last hear from Naomi?
-This afternoon.

663
00:58:12.708 --> 00:58:14.042
Have you spoke
to authorities?

664
00:58:14.125 --> 00:58:16.667
They said it was too soon
to report her missing.

665
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.875
Maybe they're right.

666
00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:21.083
I can think of a hundred excuses why Naomi
wouldn't call back.

667
00:58:21.167 --> 00:58:23.250
She's one of the best sailors
in the Caribbean.

668
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.958
I need you to take me her.

669
00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:26.917
-I'm sure she's fine.
-She's not.

670
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.667
I can feel it.

671
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:30.833
I need your help,
Diddle Bay. Please.

672
00:58:30.917 --> 00:58:32.417
Okay. I'll take you there,

673
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.417
but even though I'm saying yes now,
that storm's on its way.

674
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:38.792
It's suicide to go there now.
We have to wait until morning.

675
00:58:38.875 --> 00:58:40.208
I-- I can't wait that long.

676
00:58:40.292 --> 00:58:41.792
There's no faster way of getting there.

677
00:58:41.875 --> 00:58:45.042
Not unless you get your hands on
the fastest boat in Grenada.

678
00:58:45.125 --> 00:58:47.500
[up-tempo music]

679
00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:53.875
Barny... I need you
to give Diddle Bay

680
00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:55.833
Serenity's last coordinates
and in the morning,

681
00:58:55.917 --> 00:58:57.833
you take a flight with him
to look for Naomi.

682
00:58:57.917 --> 00:58:59.083
What you gonna do?

683
00:58:59.167 --> 00:59:00.583
Gonna catch me a marlin.

684
00:59:03.125 --> 00:59:04.708
Good luck.

[Maria] She is asleep.

695

Ah.

696
01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:08.208
How many kilos did we lose?

697
01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:11.208
[in Spanish] I don't know. I didn't see.

698
01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:13.417
[in English] Anything that is missing
is going to come

699
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.750
out of our pockets.
[in Spanish] You get that, right?

700
01:01:15.833 --> 01:01:19.000
[in English] I don't... Maria, hey,
it happens all the time.

701
01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:23.750
People lose loads.
I mean, it wasn't our fault, no?

702
01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:26.500
Do you wanna say that
to <i>el jefe?</i> Hey?

703
01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.375
Seriously, you could also explain him

704
01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:31.792
that you decided to hire
a new crew, huh?

705
01:01:31.875 --> 01:01:34.375
Who wanted to take
all the money from us.

706
01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.042
[in Spanish] Okay, okay, okay,
all right... [in English] My mistake.

707
01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:38.833
My fucking mistake, okay?

708
01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:40.042
[in Spanish] I know!

709
01:01:46.167 --> 01:01:49.125
[in English] We need to get out of this
line of business.

710
01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:53.375
[in Spanish] Mm-hmm. How?

711
01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:57.958
[in English] I want to set up my own
distribution business.

712
01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:03.750
Ah... In America, huh?

713
01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:06.667
Yeah, well, I thought
I had saved enough money

714
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:09.792
to get it off the ground
but then this shit happened...

715
01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:11.750
because of you.

716
01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.500
Maria...

717
01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:24.208
maybe this is our golden opportunity.

718
01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:26.167
[in Spanish] What the fuck
are you talking about?

719
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:27.833
Maria, look.

720
01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:31.125
We pick up the drugs,

721
01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:34.750
we bring them to Florida, we sell them.

722
01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:39.375
[in English] Bang! We have a new business!

723
01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:40.708
[in Spanish] You're an idiot.

724
01:02:40.792 --> 01:02:44.708
[in English] They know who we are!
They know who our families are!

725
01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:46.875
No, no, no, no, no, no. Maybe...

726
01:02:46.958 --> 01:02:49.417
Maybe they're gonna think
I don't know, we...

727
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.875
We're lost... we... we dead!
We're dead in the sea!

728
01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.000
[gasps] Do you really think
they're going to forget

729
01:02:55.083 --> 01:02:58.375
about the one million dollars'
worth of their cocaine?

730
01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:00.208
They will find out!

731
01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:04.833
We will be looking
over our shoulders

732
01:03:04.917 --> 01:03:07.125
for the rest of our lives.

733
01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:11.792
No, Maria, we already are.

Are you okay?
[panting]

744
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.750
Let go, I have to go back.

745
01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:00.750
I have to, darling.

746
01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:02.917
I have to get your mother
to safety too.

747
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.375
[gasps]
I'll be back very soon.

748
01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:06.500
I promise.

Papa! Papa!

Papa!

752
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.625
[Jose] Wake up!

753
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:16.250
Get up.

754
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.083
Come on!

755
01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:22.333
We've got company.

01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:25.708
[boat motor hums]

757
01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:36.917
Who is that?

758
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:43.833
Who did you talk to?

759
01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:53.208
Nobody. I didn't speak
to anybody.

760
01:04:54.292 --> 01:04:55.292
Seriously?

761
01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.250
I couldn't get signal.

762
01:05:00.042 --> 01:05:04.417
Jose, as soon as the boat
is in range... just shoot him.

763
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.542
No! Wait...

764
01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:08.875
So you do know who he is.

765
01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:12.458
[sinister music]

766
01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.375
It's my boyfriend.

767
01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:18.375
He has me logged on his GPS.

768
01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:22.083
We've been here for 24 hours,
he might have thought I'm in trouble.

769
01:05:24.542 --> 01:05:27.042
Your boyfriend drove
through the night

770
01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:30.583
because he thought you
might be in trouble.

771
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.292
He must be very much in love
with you and you with him.

772
01:05:37.042 --> 01:05:39.792
So this is the way
it's going to go.

773
01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:44.042
If you want to live
happily ever after,

774
01:05:44.125 --> 01:05:46.750
you will do exactly as I say.

775
01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:49.750
Now wave.

776
01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:55.250
And smile.

777
01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.625
[boat motor hums]

778
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.958

782
01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.917
-Why didn't you ring?
-I'm so sorry...

783
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.750
What if something
happened to you?

784

786
01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:49.625
[Jackson] What is this?

787
01:06:49.708 --> 01:06:52.583
Um, your friend Naomi
saved our lives

788
01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:55.292
and we are very
grateful for that.

789
01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:59.417
Now she's helping us retrieve our product
from our boat that sank.

790
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.792
Product?

791
01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.208
And once this is over,

792
01:07:02.292 --> 01:07:05.208
you two will take us
to the Florida Keys.

793
01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:08.250
It's deep. I already did
two dives yesterday.

794
01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:09.958
There's sharks
in the water, Jack.

795
01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:11.708
One of them killed
their partner.

796
01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:13.292
-[Jackson] I'll dive.
-No, you won't.

797
01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:14.833
-No, hold on. I...
-[Maria] No!

798
01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:18.875
-[in Spanish] Don't move, asshole!
-[in English] You will stay here with me.

799
01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:22.875
And any funny business
from you and he gets it.

805
01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:04.375
That was very nice of you
to come all this way

806
01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:06.167
to help your girlfriend.

807
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.708
I didn't help much, did I?

808
01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:11.167
Why did you tell Naomi you needed her
to help you get to Florida?

809
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:12.833
I saw you tie that knot.

810
01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:15.750
You know how to sail, don't you?

811
01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:22.625
Jackson, hope is
a great motivator.

812
01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:26.457
Why on earth would she go down,
with a shark in the water,

813
01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:29.332
if she didn't think she was
having a chance to survive?

814
01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:30.500
Huh?

815
01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.667
-What about your brother?
-[laughs]

816
01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:35.500
Are you planning on
killing him too?

817
01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:37.292
[laughs] My brother...

818
01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:40.582
Right now he's
a useful idiot.

819
01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:43.875
I mean, Naomi's down there
saving your lives.

820
01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:47.457
He's saving a few
bricks of cocaine.

821
01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:52.375
I don't think that makes
him the smart one.

I'm always going to be
with you, Naomi.

834
01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:47.167
You should know that.

835

Your mother and I are
so proud of you.

You can't give up now,

you've been through.

You always do.

Please, don't leave me.

I will always be with you.
