00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:29.625
<i>Mayday, mayday...</i>

2
00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:31.875
<i>Do you copy?</i>

3
00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.500
<i>Mayday, this is Tranquility...</i>

4
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:40.875
<i>Do you copy?</i>

5
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.417
<i>This is Nassau Coast Guard.
What's your emergency? Over.</i>

6
00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:48.333
<i>We're sinking!</i>

7
00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:53.667
<i>Okay, sir, remain calm.
We need your coordinates. Over.</i>

8
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.917
<i>Sir, can you repeat that? Over.</i>

9
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.125
<i>Please repeat your coordinates. Over.</i>

10
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.792
{\an8}<i>Tranquility, we need
your coordinates. Over.</i>

11
00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:18.000
<i>How many are you? Over.</i>

12
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.625
<i>Three. My daughter,
Naomi, she... she's eight.</i>

13
00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.792
<i>We're drifting...
Wait, where's Naomi?</i>

14
00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:30.500
<i>Naomi! Naomi!</i>

15
00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.625
Papa!

16
00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:45.333
Papa!

17
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:49.625
Help!

18
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.542
Help!

19
00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.208
Papa!

20
00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:06.917
Papa!

21
00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:01.375
<i>Wow, look at this!</i>

22
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.375
<i>It's spectacular down here,
isn't it?</i>

23
00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.500
<i>Welcome to my happy place.</i>

24
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.792
<i>You take the lead from here.</i>

25
00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.250
<i>Look at this, the shrimp and crabs
all feed on this algae.</i>

26
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:27.250
{\an8}<i>Don't worry,
I'm following, I'm here.</i>

27
00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:44.500
<i>Hey, why don't we take a selfie
for your mom?</i>

28
00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.833
<i>You're a great photographer,
take a photo of me here.</i>

29
00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:55.167
<i>This is amazing.</i>

30
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.042
<i>Hey, sis!</i>

31
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.125
<i>Wish you were here!</i>

32
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:09.875
<i>Okay, it's not going to hurt us.</i>

33
00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.125
<i>The sound of breathing
attracts them, okay?</i>

34
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:20.000
<i>You try this time.
Be firm, but gentle, okay?</i>

35
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:24.167
<i>No sudden movements now.</i>

36
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.667
<i>Ready?</i>

37
00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:36.708
<i>Whoa!</i>

38
00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:39.542
<i>Ha!</i>

39
00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.833
Well, I'm sure we can
accommodate that, Mr. Margisson.

40
00:07:09.917 --> 00:07:11.083
Yes.

41
00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:13.250
Uh-huh.

42
00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.333
Look, why don't I call you back
when I'm with my partner.

43
00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:21.750
Ah, she's not available right now,
but, uh, I'll be with her shortly.

44
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.667
Great, okay.

45
00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.500
Thank you so much.

46
00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:37.583
Whoa!

47
00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:39.958
That was awesome!

48
00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:45.417
Can't wait to tell your mom.
My nephew, the shark wrangler!

49
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.917
That was so cool!
That was a reef shark, right?

50
00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:50.500
Yeah.

51
00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:52.750
And he really loved
the bubbles.

52
00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:56.167
It's not the bubbles, remember,
it's the sound they make.

53
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.750
I wanna see you do that
with a tiger shark!

54
00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.833
You wanna see me end up
as lunch? Huh?

55
00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:04.250
Hmm. Okay!

56
00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:08.417
Right, my two lovelies,
we have a flight to catch.

57
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.292
Can we do one last dive?

58
00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:11.833
Uh-uh. We have to go.

59
00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:14.042
That was the Margissons
on the phone.

60
00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.000
They wanna confirm their booking
for next week.

61
00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:17.042
Oh, cool.

62
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.583
So that gives me four days

63
00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:22.875
to leisurely sail back home
to you guys.

64
00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.083
Also, Naomi, I need to put
a deposit down

65
00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:27.542
on that apartment we looked at.
The one we loved.

66
00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:30.375
Can we delay that?

67
00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.457
I mean... I still need to
think about it.

68
00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:44.042
Come on then, let's get you guys
on that flight.

69
00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:12.250
-Be with you in a sec! I know.
-Come on, man!

70
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.458
I know! One minute.

71
00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:15.125
See you in four days.

72
00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:18.292
Yeah, I'll get the Margissons
from the airport. Please be on time.

73
00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:20.583
When have I ever not
been reliable?

74
00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:22.667
Mwah... I'll see you soon.

75
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.542
Don't have too much fun
without me.

76
00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:27.458
-Never.
-Barny! Hug!

77
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.250
-Love you.
-Love you too.

78
00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:34.333
We have to go now!

79
00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:44.917
You cut it too close my friend.
You're gonna run me out of business.

80
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.500
Next time, I'm gonna charge you.

81
00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:47.958
What happened to island time?

82
00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:50.417
Yeah, get in before
I change my mind!

83
00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:07.625
Cheers.

84
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.083
Hold on, is that what
I think it is?

85
00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:13.042
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:16.125
Oh my god, he finally popped
the question!

87
00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:19.333
He's been asking for a while
and I finally said yes.

88
00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:21.875
I'm so sorry. Condolences.

89
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.208
I remember what it was like
to be young, free and single.

90
00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:27.292
It's not all it's cracked
up to be.

91
00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:30.417
Why are you talking
like an old lady?

92
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.083
As I remember, it had
its moments.

93
00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:43.833
You know, it's not that I wanna
be single again. Um...

94
00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:49.000
So what, you just wanna go sailing
round and round the islands?

95
00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:52.875
I can think of worse ways
to spend the rest of my life.

96
00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958
The real question is,

97
00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:58.250
do you wanna do that all alone,
or with Jackson?

98
00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:00.417
You know you can
trust him, Naomi.

99
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.000
He'll never let you down.

100
00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:12.958
What is wrong with me?

101
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.625
Why is it so hard for me
to commit to the man I love?

102
00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:20.750
Don't sweat it. It took me a while
but that moment of clarity will come

103
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.333
when it's best for you to move
forward with your life.

104
00:13:24.417 --> 00:13:26.208
I hope so.

105
00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.833
No, I'm leaving early tomorrow.
I should get some sleep.

106
00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:34.792
Okay.

107
00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:37.000
Call me as soon as you're back.
Soon as.

108
00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.750
-Love you. Thank you.
-Aww... You're welcome.

109
00:15:22.167 --> 00:15:23.458
Hi.

110
00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:24.583
<i>Hi.</i>

111
00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:26.792
<i>How was your flight?</i>

112
00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:30.500
I mean, it's Diddle Bay Airlines.
As long as you get there in one piece.

113
00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:32.417
Mmm.

114
00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.875
Ah, just so you know,
the Margissons' deposit came in,

115
00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.375
so the charter next week is a go.

116
00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:40.833
Okay.

117
00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:44.417
When are you leaving?

118
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.125
<i>As soon as I've had a coffee.

119
00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:51.125
<i>Is everything alright there?</i>

120
00:15:52.583 --> 00:15:54.708
<i>Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.</i>

121
00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:03.167
Oh...

122
00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:05.875
Christ, I'm an idiot.

123
00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:10.167
It's the anniversary of
the death of both of her parents.

124
00:16:11.542 --> 00:16:12.833
I completely forgot.

125
00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:16.458
Such a dumbass.

126
00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.042
You should call her back.

127
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.333
That'll just make it worse.

128
00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:28.458
Just text her back,
"Whatever I said,

129
00:16:28.542 --> 00:16:29.958
whatever I did,

130
00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:32.250
I didn't mean it.
I want you back for good."

131
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:36.542
Are you trying to help me
with my love life

132
00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:38.292
by quoting "Take That?"

133
00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:43.083
So let me get this straight, you think
Man U are gonna lose this one, right?

134
00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:46.708
I'm telling you. I have a real
feeling about this one.

135
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.250
You're mad.

136
00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:54.792
Jack. Come take a look at this.

137
00:18:57.417 --> 00:18:58.667
There's Naomi's course.

138
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.542
And that's where the weather
system is heading.

139
00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:02.833
Yeah.

140
00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:07.042
I'll call her?

141
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:08.167
Sure.

142
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.000
<i>Serenity, do you copy?</i>

143
00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:19.458
<i>Naomi, do you copy?</i>

144
00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:23.750
This is Serenity. Over.

145
00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:27.625
<i>There's a squall that's moving
West/North-West at 20 knots.</i>

146
00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:32.667
It's predicted to intersect with you
just North of Martinique. Over.

147
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.375
<i>I picked that up too.</i>

148
00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:38.167
Thank you Barny.
I'm changing course to avoid.

149
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.042
You know, maybe you should anchor
at Dominica until it passes. Over.

150
00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:44.917
Yeah, so I could be stuck there
for three or four days.

151
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.458
<i>Do you really wanna babysit
the Margissons?</i>

152
00:19:48.542 --> 00:19:50.417
No, thank you. Over.

153
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.250
<i>I'm heading Lat...</i>

154
00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:58.333
<i>Fourteen... 14.7214, Long 63.0...</i>

155
00:19:58.417 --> 00:20:02.458
...281. I'll keep the squall
North of me.

156
00:20:02.542 --> 00:20:04.667
Uh, hang on, that takes you out
of shipping lanes

157
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.583
<i>and into dead water. Over.</i>

158
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:11.625
I know. But, um,
I've got this Jackson.

159
00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:13.875
I know you do...

160
00:20:16.125 --> 00:20:21.625
Look, I'm sorry I forgot about
the anniversary yesterday. Over.

161
00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:27.583
Yeah, let's not...
talk about this now.

162
00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:30.292
Sorry. Over.

163
00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:35.792
But I appreciate it.
Thank you. Over.

164
00:22:56.208 --> 00:23:00.042
Hey! Help! Aah!

165
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.708
Help us!

166
00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:18.917
Jackson. Come in. Over.

167
00:23:21.208 --> 00:23:23.375
<i>Jackson...
Where are you? Over.</i>

168
00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:24.667
I'm here. Over.

169
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.167
<i>I pulled out of the path of the storm
and I'm currently spotting two people</i>

170
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.500
<i>holding onto wreckage. Over.</i>

171
00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:35.333
No good, Jack.
The storm is going that way.

172
00:23:35.417 --> 00:23:38.208
Naomi, you need to be further South
or you'll definitely

173
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.625
<i>get hit by the tail end
of that squall.</i>

174
00:23:40.708 --> 00:23:43.917
<i>I think you should just
call it in. Over.</i>

175
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.125
By the time anyone reaches location,
it won't be a rescue.

176
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:48.917
<i>It will be a recovery.</i>

177
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.500
<i>Over.</i>

178
00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:54.125
<i>Let me know when you intercept.
I'll lock you in on the GPS.</i>

179
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:56.208
-<i>Over.
</i>-I will. Over.

180
00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:14.917
Help us! <i>Hola!</i>

181
00:24:15.333 --> 00:24:16.667
Over here!

182
00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:20.750
Yes, yes.

183
00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:22.792
-<i>Gracias!
-</i>-<i>Gracias!</i>

184
00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:28.875
Hold tight! I'm gonna come right
up to you.

185
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.750
Yeah!

186
00:24:47.375 --> 00:24:52.875
<i>Gracias</i>. <i>Uh</i>... <i>Gracias</i>.

187
00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:55.125
Oh... Uh!

188
00:24:56.292 --> 00:24:59.708
Ah! Uh... Oh...

189
00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:03.542
<i>Gracias</i>.

190
00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:06.083
Thank you, lady! Thanks!

191
00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:11.000
<i>Gracias</i>.

192
00:25:15.167 --> 00:25:18.125
Listen,
my brother is in the water

193
00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:21.500
in a sunken boat. I need you
to go help him, please.

194
00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:24.083
More slowly, please.
I don't understand.

195
00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:26.833
Maria says her brother
is still down there.

196
00:25:26.917 --> 00:25:28.708
The pipes, they fell on him.

197
00:25:28.792 --> 00:25:30.875
-Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
-I really am.

198
00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:32.500
We had air.

199
00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:34.958
-We had air. We breathe...
-There's an air pocket?

200
00:25:35.042 --> 00:25:37.917
-Yes.
-Okay. I can dive.

201
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.292
Really?

202
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:40.458
-<i>Gracias.
</i>-<i>Gracias.</i>

203
00:25:40.542 --> 00:25:43.000
He... He's stuck down there.

204
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:46.458
-It's only been three hours.
-Three hours?

205
00:25:46.542 --> 00:25:49.292
In three hours it could have
drifted for miles.

206
00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:53.083
No. No, no.
The wreckage we were hanging onto

207
00:25:53.167 --> 00:25:55.333
-is still connected to the boat.
-Okay.

208
00:25:55.417 --> 00:25:57.333
There's a line going
all the way down.

209
00:25:57.417 --> 00:25:59.542
Any other survivors?

210
00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:02.125
I, I don't know. I... uh...

211
00:26:02.208 --> 00:26:06.250
There were, uh, five crew
members and five passengers,

212
00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:08.083
-including us.
-And what happened?

213
00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.875
Something must have gone wrong
with the engine.

214
00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:13.083
-There was an explosion.
-Explosion, explosion.

215
00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:16.583
<i>Sí, sí</i>. Then we went
straight down.

216
00:26:17.792 --> 00:26:22.542
Listen, the odds of anyone
surviving aren't good.

217
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:26.167
She shouldn't get her
hopes up, okay?

218
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.792
Sorry, I... I'm gonna get you
some warm clothes.

219
00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:34.375
Thank you very much.

220
00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:37.583
Do you trust her? What did she say?

221
00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:39.083
He's going to be okay.

222
00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:40.833
Okay.

223
00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:45.542
Serenity, come in. Over.

224
00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:48.875
Serenity, do you copy? Over.

225
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:52.958
Do you copy? Over.

226
00:26:56.333 --> 00:26:57.875
What are you doing?

227
00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.667
I'm calling the
nearest coastguard.

228
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.458
I need to let them know
what's going on.

229
00:27:01.542 --> 00:27:03.208
No, no!
Not the radio, please!

230
00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:05.083
We need to
follow protocol here.

231
00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:06.542
No!

232
00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:08.958
We are... <i>refugiados</i>.

233
00:27:09.042 --> 00:27:10.458
Refugees.

234
00:27:10.542 --> 00:27:13.000
<i>Sí. Sí.</i> Refugees.

235
00:27:13.083 --> 00:27:16.792
We... we gave our money to people
on the boat.

236
00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:20.333
In our country the gangs
and the cartels are in control.

237
00:27:20.417 --> 00:27:21.417
They're ruthless.

238
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.792
If we're sent back there,
we will almost certainly be killed.

239
00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:28.875
I'm so sorry. I just need help,
I don't know what to do.

240
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:29.875
No, please.

241
00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:32.292
But you said he's trapped.
Even with a crowbar,

242
00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:34.417
-I may not manage this alone.
-I can help you.

243
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.667
I worked marine salvage.
I know how to dive.

244
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.083
<i>Sí. Sí.</i>

245
00:27:38.167 --> 00:27:39.625
Please, you must hurry.

246
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:41.875
-He's my brother! My brother!
-I'm so sorry.

247
00:27:41.958 --> 00:27:43.625
He's going to die.
I need help...

248
00:27:43.708 --> 00:27:45.208
Help me! Help me, please!

249
00:27:45.292 --> 00:27:48.333
I promise you...
I'm gonna bring him back, okay?

250
00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:49.500
-Okay.
-I promise you.

251
00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:50.458
-Okay.
-Okay?

252
00:27:58.042 --> 00:28:00.250
<i>Is your earpiece working?
Can you hear me?</i>

253
00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:01.833
<i>Okay. Perfect.</i>

254
00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:20.625
<i>You okay?</i>

255
00:29:50.792 --> 00:29:54.500
<i>Okay. That way. You go first.</i>

256
00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:02.917
Hey! Hey! I'm here! Hey!

257
00:31:05.417 --> 00:31:07.625
Please, help me! Help me!

258
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:11.125
-Do you speak English?
-Are you hurt?

259
00:31:11.208 --> 00:31:14.708
Yeah. No, look, I can't move.

260
00:31:14.792 --> 00:31:18.333
Fucking boat!
I'm stuck and I can't breathe!

261
00:31:18.417 --> 00:31:20.125
I can't breathe.

262
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:22.208
This is gonna give you
some fresh air.

263
00:31:22.292 --> 00:31:23.292
Oh...

264
00:31:23.375 --> 00:31:25.667
Shallow breaths.

265
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.167
Jose, I need to you stay calm.

266
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.292
I'm here with your friend.
We're gonna take you up.

267
00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:34.167
Listen, I can't move this.

268
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.000
We're gonna try with a crowbar.

269
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:40.167
-Promise, I'll be back.
-Okay.

270
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.792
I'm not gonna leave you.

271
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:55.875
<i>Gracias,
gracias, gracias.</i>

272
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.542
Hey, Tomas! Hey!

273
00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:04.792
Hey! Tomas! <i>Gracias.</i>

274
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:12.250
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-More, more, more.

275
00:32:12.333 --> 00:32:13.750
<i>Sí.</i>.. Ah! Uh!

276
00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:17.708
Aah! Uh...

277
00:32:17.792 --> 00:32:21.208
Get out of there!
Go on, go on. Push harder.

278
00:32:22.792 --> 00:32:25.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

279
00:32:28.167 --> 00:32:30.208
Hey! Where did you go?

280
00:32:32.958 --> 00:32:36.500
Here, put this on.

281
00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:41.292
Just breathe calmly, okay?

282
00:32:41.375 --> 00:32:43.708
Stay calm.

283
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.167
Okay.

284
00:32:47.333 --> 00:32:48.542
Let's go.

285
00:32:55.458 --> 00:32:58.042
<i>You okay? Yes?</i>

286
00:32:58.125 --> 00:33:00.250
<i>Okay, let's go. You go first.</i>

287
00:33:33.958 --> 00:33:34.875
<i>Ah!</i>

288
00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:12.208
<i>Do you see him? Do you see him?</i>

289
00:34:17.875 --> 00:34:21.208
<i>Stay... Stay close.</i>

290
00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:38.208
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

291
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.167
<i>We're running out of air.</i>

292
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.792
<i>Okay, we go up.</i>

293
00:34:58.708 --> 00:35:00.875
<i>Stay... Stay calm.</i>

294
00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:11.792
<i>Can you see him?</i>

295
00:35:26.083 --> 00:35:29.250
<i>Okay? Okay. We go up.</i>

296
00:35:58.167 --> 00:36:00.167
<i>No! Ugh...

297
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.625
<i>Calm... Calm, okay?</i>

298
00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:14.250
<i>Calm down, try to
breathe calmly.</i>

299
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:19.208
<i>We're gonna... We're gonna run
out of air.</i>

300
00:36:34.958 --> 00:36:39.375
<i>Jose, calm.
Okay, we're gonna go up.</i>

301
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.250
<i>We should go.</i>

302
00:37:28.917 --> 00:37:30.167
<i>Okay, go up.</i>

303
00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:35.167
<i>Try to stay close.</i>

304
00:37:41.542 --> 00:37:42.667
Let's go.

305
00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:56.417
Jose! Jose!

306
00:37:57.667 --> 00:37:58.875
Jose!

307
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.042
-Uh!
-Oh!

308
00:38:07.417 --> 00:38:08.792
Where's Tomas?

309
00:38:12.542 --> 00:38:13.708
Oh, my God!

310
00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:21.333
Oh...

311
00:38:22.125 --> 00:38:24.917
Oh my God.

312
00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:43.375
Naomi, why aren't you moving?

313
00:39:08.958 --> 00:39:12.667
Maria, can you help me
out please?

314
00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:18.292
Just put anything loose into the cabinets
and just lock the doors tight.

315
00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:20.833
Okay.

316
00:39:22.917 --> 00:39:23.833
But why?

317
00:39:23.917 --> 00:39:25.583
There's a storm coming, you see?

318
00:39:28.542 --> 00:39:32.792
Just carry on with this.
I need to call the authorities.

319
00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:43.792
This is Serenity, come in. Over.

320
00:39:45.542 --> 00:39:47.750
<i>Serenity, this is
Grenada Coastguard. Over.</i>

321
00:39:47.833 --> 00:39:48.708
Hey...

322
00:39:48.792 --> 00:39:54.500
I'm currently, er... Lat 14.7214
Long... 62...

323
00:39:54.583 --> 00:39:56.917
What the fuck?

324
00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:01.500
No radio. Understand?

325
00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:02.917
Jose!

326
00:40:03.792 --> 00:40:08.458
Put your gun down! Now!

327
00:40:13.542 --> 00:40:14.542
Hmm.

328
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.958
Look Naomi, our boat was
carrying valuable product.

329
00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:27.542
We need you to go back down
and bring it up.

330
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:30.542
200 kilos of cocaine.

331
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.875
So, this is how you are
going to do it.

332
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:38.875
Our product is stored
in the front hold.

333
00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:41.667
You are going to transfer it
into those mesh bags

334
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.708
and, um, inflate that thing
to bring it up

335
00:40:44.792 --> 00:40:46.750
to the surface in one go.

336
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.292
Then you are going to take us
to the Florida Keys

337
00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:55.875
in your lovely yacht and, um,
after that we part company.

338
00:40:57.708 --> 00:41:00.167
You'll kill me
as soon as you get your drugs back.

339
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.125
No, no, no.

340
00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:04.792
We have no idea how to sail a boat.

341
00:41:05.708 --> 00:41:07.125
We need you.

342
00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:11.958
There is a shark down there.

343
00:41:12.042 --> 00:41:13.458
I know.

344
00:41:13.542 --> 00:41:15.667
And I've already done a deep dive.

345
00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:21.333
I cannot do this on my own.
It is impossible.

346
00:41:21.417 --> 00:41:24.167
Jose will help you.
He knows how to dive.

347
00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.625
Mmm.

348
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.500
So, you wanna die now...

349
00:41:29.333 --> 00:41:31.292
or you wanna take your chance
with the shark?

350
00:41:33.917 --> 00:41:35.625
Go and get me a wetsuit.

351
00:41:37.417 --> 00:41:38.958
Now!

352
00:41:39.042 --> 00:41:41.958
Come on! Get a move on!

353
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.125
No. You stay in there.

354
00:41:51.083 --> 00:41:52.500
Let's get changed.

355
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.417
Come on! Come on!

356
00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:12.250
Come on! Come on!

357
00:42:23.917 --> 00:42:27.667
Hello? Hello? Naomi?

358
00:42:28.708 --> 00:42:30.125
-<i>Naomi?
</i>-Jack...

359
00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:31.875
You bitch!

360
00:42:31.958 --> 00:42:33.458
-Jose!
-Yeah!

361
00:42:33.542 --> 00:42:35.875
Jose! She's on her phone.

362
00:42:35.958 --> 00:42:37.458
<i>Naomi!</i>

363
00:42:37.542 --> 00:42:39.750
<i>Speak to me!</i>

364
00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:41.083
<i>What's happening?</i>

365
00:42:41.167 --> 00:42:42.375
You fucking bitch!

366
00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:43.833
Naomi...

367
00:42:43.917 --> 00:42:45.333
Naomi!

368
00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:47.292
Stop!

369
00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:50.083
We're gonna need that
when we get to the US. Stop!

370
00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.250
Hey, Jose!

371
00:42:52.583 --> 00:42:56.542
Put on your diving gear.
You're both going down now!

372
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:01.208
Barny, we need to go.

373
00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:03.625
Where are we going?

374
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.875
-Where are we going?
-Hold on tight!

375
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:41.000
Jose, remember 20 minutes
and it's dark, okay?

376
00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:43.333
I know. I know, all right?

377
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.708
You stay close to me.

378
00:43:46.792 --> 00:43:49.250
I know where we're going.

379
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.875
Fuck's sake!

380
00:48:17.917 --> 00:48:19.167
She was frantic when she called.

381
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:22.083
There was definitely someone else
on the boat. She's been in the same place

382
00:48:22.167 --> 00:48:23.750
-for way too long.
-But she just called.

383
00:48:23.833 --> 00:48:25.917
She's alive. This is good.
Just call her back.

384
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.750
The phone is dead. No answer.

385
00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:30.375
Sometimes these satellite phones
are not very reliable.

386
00:48:30.458 --> 00:48:31.583
Especially in this weather.

387
00:48:31.667 --> 00:48:34.250
No, it's not that!
Something is wrong, I know it.

388
00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:36.542
-What do you want me to do?
-Send a search team now!

389
00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:38.625
Naomi's in trouble. Please!

390
00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:41.750
Young man, based on what?
She isn't missing. You just spoke to her.

391
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:44.542
She called because
she's in distress!

392
00:48:44.625 --> 00:48:47.250
And you tell me the reason she stopped
was because she saw survivors?

393
00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:48.917
-floating on debris?
-Yes!

394
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.917
There has been no alerts
for or from any ships in the area.

395
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.958
You need to do something!

396
00:48:54.042 --> 00:48:55.333
Everything okay?

397
00:48:56.875 --> 00:48:59.375
I have a few colleagues
in the surrounding islands.

398
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:02.458
I can make a few phone calls
but that's the best I can do.

399
00:49:02.542 --> 00:49:05.042
Until she's been missing
for more than 24 hours,

400
00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:07.625
I cannot make any kind of
distress classification.

401
00:49:07.708 --> 00:49:09.250
I am sorry, my hands are tied!

402
00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:12.583
Twenty-four hours? Twenty-four hours?!

403
00:52:12.208 --> 00:52:16.625
Jose! Jose!
Jose, where are the bricks?

404
00:52:18.625 --> 00:52:21.042
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

405
00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:28.542
Argh!

406
00:53:32.333 --> 00:53:33.708
Come on!

407
00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:05.792
What happened to the bags?

408
00:55:07.667 --> 00:55:09.292
Fuck's sake!

409
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.083
What do you mean what happened
to the bags?

410
00:55:13.167 --> 00:55:15.458
Where are the
fucking bags?

411
00:55:15.542 --> 00:55:17.417
On the trawler deck.

412
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.167
The shark bit into the bags

413
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:22.958
and now the shark is probably
high on cocaine.

414
00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:25.583
We go back down
right now. <i>Vamos!</i>

415
00:55:25.667 --> 00:55:27.333
-Forget it. I'm done.
-No, no, no.

416
00:55:27.417 --> 00:55:30.625
Nothing is done till I say it is done!
You get it?

417
00:55:30.708 --> 00:55:33.042
You were underwater
for way too long

418
00:55:33.125 --> 00:55:37.542
and I can only do two dives
at that depth.

419
00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:40.625
I know you don't give a fuck
about me, but you won't survive.

420
00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:41.833
Okay, she's right.

421
00:55:41.917 --> 00:55:43.917
And we need her
to take us to the Keys.

422
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.750
I don't care about
the fucking Keys!

423
00:55:45.833 --> 00:55:47.917
Wait, well I've made
my decision!

424
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.625
You two go back down tomorrow
in the morning.

425
00:55:50.708 --> 00:55:55.167
The crew on your boat.
They were shot.

426
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:58.667
Well, um, it happens
in our business.

427
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:02.208
They got greedy, you know?
They wanted our drugs.

428
00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:05.625
So Tomas and Jose
had to deal with them.

429
00:56:09.167 --> 00:56:11.583
The explosion didn't happen
in the engine room.

430
00:56:11.667 --> 00:56:16.583
What kind of an idiot
brings grenades onto a boat?

431
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:19.708
-Yeah.
-A fucking dead idiot.

432
00:56:19.792 --> 00:56:21.500
I need to raise the anchor.

433
00:56:21.583 --> 00:56:23.917
-Why?
-Why?

434
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.708
‘Cause you cannot be anchored
in a storm.

435
00:56:26.792 --> 00:56:30.625
No! We're not going to fall into
one of your tricks again!

436
00:56:32.292 --> 00:56:33.875
A swell can breach the deck

437
00:56:33.958 --> 00:56:36.208
and the boat will
fill with water!

438
00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:37.708
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. No!

439
00:56:37.792 --> 00:56:40.042
We're already tied
up onto that stuff.

440
00:56:40.125 --> 00:56:43.125
The boat stays right here,
next to the trawler.

441
00:56:43.208 --> 00:56:44.625
Do you understand?

442
00:56:45.542 --> 00:56:47.125
Do you understand?

443
00:56:47.208 --> 00:56:50.958
Exactly. The boat
stays right here.

444
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.083
-What do you want?
-I need to see your husband.

445
00:57:15.167 --> 00:57:17.875
You're gonna have to wait.
He's busy with a potential client.

446
00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:19.833
-It can't wait, it's important.
-No way.

447
00:57:19.917 --> 00:57:22.500
-Come back later.
-I'll be quick. Wait here.

448
00:57:22.583 --> 00:57:23.667
Jack!

449
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.250
We will fly to the South side.

450
00:57:25.333 --> 00:57:28.167
This coast is especially lovely
this time of the year.

451
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:29.917
That's good.

452
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.125
Hey, my friend!
This is Jackson Taylor,

453
00:57:32.208 --> 00:57:34.708
co-owner and operator of the best
sailing yacht in the Caribbean.

454
00:57:34.792 --> 00:57:36.958
Hi. Can I have a word please?

455
00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:39.625
Yes, sure, of course.

456
00:57:39.708 --> 00:57:41.042
Please, sit down.

457
00:57:41.125 --> 00:57:42.625
I want you to watch this video

458
00:57:42.708 --> 00:57:45.042
and picture yourself flying
over the majestic paradise,

459
00:57:45.125 --> 00:57:47.667
while I attend to Mr. Taylor.
Just a moment, yeah?

460
00:57:52.292 --> 00:57:55.500
Jack, I hope this is important. I haven't
had a charter for over two weeks.

461
00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:57.417
Naomi was on her way back here.

462
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.042
She came across a wreckage and survivors
in the sea west of Martinique.

463
00:58:01.125 --> 00:58:04.250
There's a squall heading that way as well.
Something's wrong.

464
00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:06.458
Serenity's been in the same
spot for a very long time.

465
00:58:06.542 --> 00:58:08.458
She's not responding
to her radio.

466
00:58:08.542 --> 00:58:09.958
This isn't like her.

467
00:58:10.042 --> 00:58:12.625
-When did you last hear from Naomi?
-This afternoon.

468
00:58:12.708 --> 00:58:14.042
Have you spoke
to authorities?

469
00:58:14.125 --> 00:58:16.667
They said it was too soon
to report her missing.

470
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.875
Maybe they're right.

471
00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:21.083
I can think of a hundred excuses why Naomi
wouldn't call back.

472
00:58:21.167 --> 00:58:23.250
She's one of the best sailors
in the Caribbean.

473
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.958
I need you to take me her.

474
00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:26.917
-I'm sure she's fine.
-She's not.

475
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.667
I can feel it.

476
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:30.833
I need your help,
Diddle Bay. Please.

477
00:58:30.917 --> 00:58:32.417
Okay. I'll take you there,

478
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.417
but even though I'm saying yes now,
that storm's on its way.

479
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:38.792
It's suicide to go there now.
We have to wait until morning.

480
00:58:38.875 --> 00:58:40.208
I-- I can't wait that long.

481
00:58:40.292 --> 00:58:41.792
There's no faster way of getting there.

482
00:58:41.875 --> 00:58:45.042
Not unless you get your hands on
the fastest boat in Grenada.

483
00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:53.875
Barny... I need you
to give Diddle Bay

484
00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:55.833
Serenity's last coordinates
and in the morning,

485
00:58:55.917 --> 00:58:57.833
you take a flight with him
to look for Naomi.

486
00:58:57.917 --> 00:58:59.083
What you gonna do?

487
00:58:59.167 --> 00:59:00.583
Gonna catch me a marlin.

488
00:59:03.125 --> 00:59:04.708
Good luck.

489
01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:00.083
She is asleep.

490
01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:02.917
Ah.

491
01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:08.208
How many kilos did we lose?

492
01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:11.208
I don't know. I didn't see.

493
01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:13.417
Anything that is missing
is going to come

494
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.750
-out of our pockets.
-You get that, right?

495
01:01:15.833 --> 01:01:19.000
I don't... Maria, hey,
it happens all the time.

496
01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:23.750
People lose loads.
I mean, it wasn't our fault, no?

497
01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:26.500
Do you wanna say that
to <i>el jefe?</i> Hey?

498
01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.375
Seriously, you could also explain him

499
01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:31.792
that you decided to hire
a new crew, huh?

500
01:01:31.875 --> 01:01:34.375
Who wanted to take
all the money from us.

501
01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.042
Okay, okay, okay,
all right... My mistake.

502
01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:38.833
My fucking mistake, okay?

503
01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:40.042
I know!

504
01:01:46.167 --> 01:01:49.125
We need to get out of this
line of business.

505
01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:53.375
Mm-hmm. How?

506
01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:57.958
I want to set up my own
distribution business.

507
01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:03.750
Ah... In America, huh?

508
01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:06.667
Yeah, well, I thought
I had saved enough money

509
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:09.792
to get it off the ground
but then this shit happened...

510
01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:11.750
because of you.

511
01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.500
Maria...

512
01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:24.208
maybe this is our golden opportunity.

513
01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:26.167
What the fuck
are you talking about?

514
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:27.833
Maria, look.

515
01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:31.125
We pick up the drugs,

516
01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:34.750
we bring them to Florida, we sell them.

517
01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:39.375
Bang! We have a new business!

518
01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:40.708
You're an idiot.

519
01:02:40.792 --> 01:02:44.708
They know who we are!
They know who our families are!

520
01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:46.875
No, no, no, no, no, no. Maybe...

521
01:02:46.958 --> 01:02:49.417
Maybe they're gonna think
I don't know, we...

522
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.875
We're lost... we... we dead!
We're dead in the sea!

523
01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.000
Do you really think
they're going to forget

524
01:02:55.083 --> 01:02:58.375
about the one million dollars'
worth of their cocaine?

525
01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:00.208
They will find out!

526
01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:04.833
We will be looking
over our shoulders

527
01:03:04.917 --> 01:03:07.125
for the rest of our lives.

528
01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:11.792
No, Maria, we already are.

529
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.125
No... Papa... Papa!

530
01:03:26.417 --> 01:03:27.958
Come... Come back!

531
01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:33.000
No! No, no, no...

532
01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:44.667
No! No!

533
01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.458
Are you okay?

534
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.750
Let go, I have to go back.

535
01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:00.750
I have to, darling.

536
01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:02.917
I have to get your mother
to safety too.

537
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.375
I'll be back very soon.

538
01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:06.500
I promise.

539
01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:09.875
Papa! Papa!

540
01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:11.792
Papa!

541
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.625
Wake up!

542
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:16.250
Get up.

543
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.083
Come on!

544
01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:22.333
We've got company.

545
01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:36.917
Who is that?

546
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:43.833
Who did you talk to?

547
01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:53.208
Nobody. I didn't speak
to anybody.

548
01:04:54.292 --> 01:04:55.292
Seriously?

549
01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.250
I couldn't get signal.

550
01:05:00.042 --> 01:05:04.417
Jose, as soon as the boat
is in range... just shoot him.

551
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.542
No! Wait...

552
01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:08.875
So you do know who he is.

553
01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.375
It's my boyfriend.

554
01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:18.375
He has me logged on his GPS.

555
01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:22.083
We've been here for 24 hours,
he might have thought I'm in trouble.

556
01:05:24.542 --> 01:05:27.042
Your boyfriend drove
through the night

557
01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:30.583
because he thought you
might be in trouble.

558
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.292
He must be very much in love
with you and you with him.

559
01:05:37.042 --> 01:05:39.792
So this is the way
it's going to go.

560
01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:44.042
If you want to live
happily ever after,

561
01:05:44.125 --> 01:05:46.750
you will do exactly as I say.

562
01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:49.750
Now wave.

563
01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:55.250
And smile.

564
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.958
Jose... wave.

565
01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:39.792
What is going on?

566
01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.917
-Why didn't you ring?
-I'm so sorry...

567
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.750
What if something
happened to you?

568
01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:49.625
What is this?

569
01:06:49.708 --> 01:06:52.583
Um, your friend Naomi
saved our lives

570
01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:55.292
and we are very
grateful for that.

571
01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:59.417
Now she's helping us retrieve our product
from our boat that sank.

572
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.792
Product?

573
01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.208
And once this is over,

574
01:07:02.292 --> 01:07:05.208
you two will take us
to the Florida Keys.

575
01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:08.250
It's deep. I already did
two dives yesterday.

576
01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:09.958
There's sharks
in the water, Jack.

577
01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:11.708
One of them killed
their partner.

578
01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:13.292
-I'll dive.
-No, you won't.

579
01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:14.833
-No, hold on. I...
-No!

580
01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:18.875
-Don't move, asshole!
-You will stay here with me.

581
01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:22.875
And any funny business
from you and he gets it.

582
01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:37.375
Come on! Hurry up, huh?

583
01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:04.375
That was very nice of you
to come all this way

584
01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:06.167
to help your girlfriend.

585
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.708
I didn't help much, did I?

586
01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:11.167
Why did you tell Naomi you needed her
to help you get to Florida?

587
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:12.833
I saw you tie that knot.

588
01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:15.750
You know how to sail, don't you?

589
01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:22.625
Jackson, hope is
a great motivator.

590
01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:26.457
Why on earth would she go down,
with a shark in the water,

591
01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:29.332
if she didn't think she was
having a chance to survive?

592
01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:30.500
Huh?

593
01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.667
What about your brother?

594
01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:35.500
Are you planning on
killing him too?

595
01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:37.292
My brother...

596
01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:40.582
Right now he's
a useful idiot.

597
01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:43.875
I mean, Naomi's down there
saving your lives.

598
01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:47.457
He's saving a few
bricks of cocaine.

599
01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:52.375
I don't think that makes
him the smart one.

600
01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:42.792
Papa! I thought you were gone.

601
01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:45.333
I'm always going to be
with you, Naomi.

602
01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:47.167
You should know that.

603
01:11:50.875 --> 01:11:54.042
Your mother and I are
so proud of you.

604
01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:56.667
You can't give up now,

605
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:58.417
not after everything
you've been through.

606
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.125
But I don't know what to do.

607
01:12:01.208 --> 01:12:02.958
You'll figure it out.

608
01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.583
You always do.

609
01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:07.500
Please, don't leave me.

610
01:12:07.583 --> 01:12:10.875
Like I said,
I will always be with you.

611
01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:12.583
No, no!

612
01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:14.375
Father!

613
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:15.208
Maria! Woo!

614
01:13:15.292 --> 01:13:16.250
I got it!

615
01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:23.458
Jose! Jose! Come on, move.

616
01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:25.208
I got all of it!

617
01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:28.750
Goddammit!

618
01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:44.917
Yes!

619
01:13:51.792 --> 01:13:55.833
Following the bubbles.
Dinner time.

620
01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:47.208
Woo!

621
01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:02.833
Oh... Oh... Hey?

622
01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:15.167
Huh... Hey?

623
01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:28.333
Huh... Hey?

624
01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:32.000
Hey!

625
01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:34.625
Hey... Watch out!

626
01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:37.333
Jose! A shark! Go faster!

627
01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.125
Jose, get out of the water!

628
01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.542
Oh...

629
01:15:44.625 --> 01:15:48.042
Jose! Jose, look out!

630
01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:51.667
Oh...

631
01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:02.208
Whoa!

632
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:03.875
No!

633
01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:08.333
Aargh!

634
01:16:18.125 --> 01:16:19.292
No! Ah!

635
01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:23.583
Argh!

636
01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:27.625
No! Oh...

637
01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:29.750
No!

638
01:16:35.042 --> 01:16:36.833
Jose!

639
01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:40.333
Oh, Jose!

640
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.167
Naomi!

641
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:45.417
No!

642
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.583
Jack, look out!
She's got a gun!

643
01:16:47.667 --> 01:16:50.667
Naomi, you fucking bitch!

644
01:16:57.375 --> 01:16:58.625
Naomi, swim!

645
01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:08.000
Come with me... Come here.

646
01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:11.125
I've got you, I've got you.

647
01:17:22.542 --> 01:17:26.375
Serenity... Do you copy?

648
01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:30.625
Naomi, come in. Please come in.

649
01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:34.167
Naomi, please respond.
Come in Serenity.

650
01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:41.417
Serenity, do you copy?

651
01:17:53.917 --> 01:17:55.042
There!

652
01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:59.292
<i>We're all good
down here guys.</i>

653
01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:00.708
<i>I see you, thank you.</i>

654
01:18:00.792 --> 01:18:01.875
<i>We're coming home now.</i>

655
01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:33.792
My father was with me down there.

656
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.042
But it wasn't my usual nightmare.

657
01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:40.000
<i>I was knocked unconscious.</i>

658
01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:44.792
<i>I woke up at the bottom
of a deep dark hole.</i>

659
01:18:44.875 --> 01:18:47.625
<i>I didn't see any way out.</i>

660
01:18:47.708 --> 01:18:50.167
<i>It was easier to just give up.</i>

661
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:53.500
<i>That's when he came back to me.</i>

662
01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:58.292
<i>He told me that he would always
be there for me.</i>

663
01:19:05.042 --> 01:19:07.667
<i>I know it was just a dream.</i>

664
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.792
<i>What he said was true.</i>

665
01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:15.333
<i>All through my life he inspired me
and this time was no different.</i>

666
01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:16.750
I am so proud of you.

667
01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:19.125
<i>He made me want
to get out of there,</i>

668
01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:22.375
to keep going, to keep...
to keep living.

669
01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:27.208
I'm so glad he did.

670
01:19:31.792 --> 01:19:34.917
<i>After that, the tragedy,
the trauma</i>

671
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.875
<i>that has haunted me and kept me
awake at night,</i>

672
01:19:37.958 --> 01:19:41.667
<i>I feel like I can finally
put it behind me.</i>

673
01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:48.625
He gave me the courage to go on...

674
01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:53.125
With you.

675
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.333
Is that a proposal?

676
01:20:00.292 --> 01:20:02.750
As close as it's gonna get.

677
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:14.458
I love you.

678
01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:17.292
I love you too.

679
01:20:18.583 --> 01:20:19.750
Let's go home.

680
01:20:21.042 --> 01:20:22.250
Please.

681
01:20:28.458 --> 01:20:30.125
I'll start her up.

682
01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:02.917
This is for Jose!

683
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.167
Fucking bitch!

684
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.458
Jack!

685
01:21:08.667 --> 01:21:09.708
Jack!

686
01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:16.375
Get off her!

687
01:21:38.917 --> 01:21:40.292
It's okay.
