00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.880
NEWSCASTER: Here in Malaysia,

2
00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:48.090
there is an almost
overwhelming sense of euphoria,

3
00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:50.134
as the newly-elected prime minister

4
00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:52.887
has given this impoverished nation
the gift of hope,

5
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.598
promising to raise
the substandard minimum wage

6
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.725
and end child labour once and for all.

7
00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:59.852
Already considered a living saint,

8
00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:02.355
he has become this small country's
greatest hope,

9
00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:04.315
for a thriving future
in the new millennium.

10
00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:09.237
MAN: (EXCLAIMS) Get closer, Jaco.

11
00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:12.907
This is disgusting.
How could you let this happen?

12
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:16.911
JACO MUGATU: I have
negotiated my butt off, Giorgio.

13
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:20.748
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts.
I even sent him some pet oxen.

14
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:25.378
I mean, they love that crap in Malaysia,
but he won't budge.

15
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:27.505
WOMAN: Listen, 50% of my inventory

16
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.424
is manufactured in sweatshops
on the Malaysian border.

17
00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:32.260
Something has got to be done.

18
00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.887
MAN: If Malaysia goes, what is next?

19
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:37.932
My entire panty line is made in Vietnam.

20
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.809
We'll all go bankrupt within a year.

21
00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:43.020
The Malaysian must be
eliminated, Mugatu.

22
00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:47.525
What? No, I don't have time for this.

23
00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:48.943
WOMAN 2: Perhaps you'd rather go back

24
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:51.737
to turning out novelty neckties
in Hackensack.

25
00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:54.073
But my new fall line is almost due.

26
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.576
And I trust you would like to live
to see your spring line, as well?

27
00:01:57.702 --> 00:01:58.869
(WHIMPERS)

28
00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:02.206
The Malaysian prime minister
visits New York in 14 days.

29
00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:04.292
Do it then.

30
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.837
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week.
It's impossible! I have a show!

31
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.965
It's perfect. Invite him
to be your guest of honor.

32
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:14.010
That's not enough time. It takes
months to train an operative.

33
00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:17.179
What about Fabio? Hmm?

34
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:22.393
Too smart. This is a rush job.
He's got to be extremely dim-witted.

35
00:02:22.727 --> 00:02:26.480
-You know the profile, Jacobim.
-WOMAN: A beautiful, self-absorbed,

36
00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:29.859
simpleton who can be manipulated
and moulded like JeII-O.

37
00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:31.777
Or cookie dough.

38
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.363
-Or Play-Doh.
-Any kind of dough.

39
00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:41.245
The point is, we need an empty vessel,
a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.

40
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.998
And when he's finished,
we'll dispose of him.

41
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.499
But who?

42
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.835
I mean, where in all of God's
green goodness,

43
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:51.339
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

44
00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:56.844
Derek, I just have a few more
questions, if that's okay.

45
00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.012
DEREK: Cool.

46
00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:00.598
So when did you know
you wanted to be a model?

47
00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:02.475
DEREK: I guess it would have to be

48
00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:04.727
the first time
I went through the second grade.

49
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.105
I caught my reflection in a spoon
while I was eating my cereal,

50
00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.275
and I remember thinking,
"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking.

51
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.612
-"Maybe you could do that for a career."
-Do what?

52
00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.615
-Be professionally good-looking.
-Right.

53
00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:20.409
What would you say your
trademark is, if you have one?

54
00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:23.829
DEREK: Well, I guess the look
I'm best known for is Blue Steel.

55
00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:25.373
What's that look like?

56
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.127
That's impressive.

57
00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:33.923
And then there's Ferrari and Le Tigre.

58
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.259
Le Tigre's a lot softer.
It's a bit more of a catalogue look.

59
00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:40.346
-I use it for footwear sometimes.
-Can I see that?

60
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.102
<i>(CALL ME</i> PLAYING)

61
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:53.651
Look, without Derek Zoolander,

62
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.028
male modeling wouldn't be
what it is today.

63
00:03:56.112 --> 00:03:57.738
He is a fashion icon.

64
00:03:57.822 --> 00:04:00.157
So, do you spend a lot of time
working on these looks,

65
00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:01.617
thinking about them?

66
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.996
Sure. I've been working on Magnum
for at least eight or nine years.

67
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.083
"Magnum"? That's intriguing.
Can I see that?

68
00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.420
Are you kidding?
I shouldn't even be talking about it.

69
00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:14.088
It's nowhere near ready.

70
00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:19.260
It's almost like there's a light
around him. He exudes beauty.

71
00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:21.387
I think about Derek
every time I design a collection.

72
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.389
Derek, I don't know if you're familiar

73
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.558
with the belief that
some aboriginal tribes hold.

74
00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:29.603
It's the concept that a photo
might steal a part of your soul.

75
00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:30.813
What are your thoughts on that,

76
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.566
as someone who gets his picture
taken for a living?

77
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:38.195
MAN: <i>That Blue Steel look he does?
Oh, my gosh! The style and the hair.</i>

78
00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:42.616
You know, it's almost like the new afro
for the white man, but it's beautiful.

79
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.036
Well, I guess I would have to answer
your question with another question.

80
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.957
How many "abo-digitals"
do you see modeling?

81
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.334
REPORTER: Ladies and gentlemen,

82
00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:53.794
welcome to the fashion industry's
biggest night,

83
00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:55.045
the VH1 Fashion Awards.

84
00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.470
<i>There he is,
three-time Male Model of the Year,</i>

85
00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:04.221
<i>Derek Zoolander.</i>

86
00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:05.639
He's like music.

87
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:07.099
REPORTER: <i>Proud owner of Blue Steel,</i>

88
00:05:07.183 --> 00:05:09.310
<i>the look that made him
the legend he now is.</i>

89
00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:11.353
He's almost too good-looking.

90
00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:12.605
Hey, Paco!

91
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.402
That would be my main deterrent
in considering a relationship.

92
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:28.954
REPORTER: <i>And that's who</i>

93
00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:30.915
<i>Derek Zoolander is defending
his title against tonight.</i>

94
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.792
<i>Hansel.</i>

95
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.253
-Hansel, right here!
-All right, all right.

96
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.756
<i>The rookie sensation
who has burned his way</i>

97
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.925
<i>into the eye sockets
of the fashion world,</i>

98
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.260
<i>and left them clawing
their faces for more.</i>

99
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.097
Mugatu sucks!
Support the prime minister!

100
00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:50.434
Mugatu uses slave labour!

101
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.938
Down with Mugatu!

102
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.066
REPORTER: You hate to see something
like that at an event like this.

103
00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:59.985
Ugly protesters
bothering beautiful people.

104
00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.781
There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu
has used cheap Malaysian workers

105
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:07.201
to make his, and most
of the garment industry's, clothes.

106
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.496
-Derek! Derek!
-Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

107
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.874
You're going for your fourth straight
Male Model of the Year award tonight.

108
00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.417
Come on. Are you nervous?

109
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.545
Well, there are couple of
little butterflies in my basket,

110
00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:19.129
but I think I'm doing okay.

111
00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.465
We also hear you're working on
a new look. Can you tell us about it?

112
00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:24.969
Actually, I can't, Steve,
because it's not yet perfected.

113
00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.012
But I can tell you
that it's called Magnum and...

114
00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:28.639
Shut, baby, shut!

115
00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.849
If I tell you anything else,
this guy's gonna kill me.

116
00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:32.560
Got that right.
How are you doing, Steven?

117
00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:35.896
-Maury Ballstein, Balls Models.
-A man who needs no introduction.

118
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.400
Maury, you've handled every important
male model for the last 30 years.

119
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:41.735
-Derek's chances tonight?
-Let me tell you something.

120
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.863
Nobody can touch Derek.
Nobody! I gotta get inside.

121
00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:47.992
I'm shvitzing like a shmendrick
with all these lights.

122
00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:59.378
Derek! Derek!
Are you worried about Hansel?

123
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:03.048
Not as much
as I'm worried about Gretel.

124
00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.218
Hey, put that Hansel and Gretel
line in your article.

125
00:07:06.302 --> 00:07:08.012
I want people to know
how funny I can be.

126
00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.806
Oh, believe me, they'll know.
It hits newsstands tomorrow.

127
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.934
Excuse me, Mr. Mugatu.
Mr. Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.

<i>Time</i> magazine.

129

Any comment on Prime Minister
Hassan's wage increases

130
00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:19.982
-for Malaysian garment workers?
-No, he has no comment.

131
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.442
Why don't you let him
speak for himself?

132
00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:24.111
Isn't it true you'd like to see
the prime minister out of power

133
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.238
so you can continue
exploiting cheap Malaysian workers?

134
00:07:26.322 --> 00:07:30.075
Hey, Mugatu! Screw you
and your little dog, too!

135

Yes!

138
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.208
Yes.

139
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:40.044
Wow.

140
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.297
I just can't tell you how much
this means to me,

141
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.883
to be the first recipient
of this beautiful award.

142
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.719
We have a serious problem
on our hands, Maury.

143
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:51.555
This Malaysian thing
is getting out of hand.

144
00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.973
I hear you, Jaco.

145
00:07:53.057 --> 00:07:55.934
What this, the Slashie, mean,

146
00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:59.521
is you consider me
the best actor slash model,

147
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.857
and not the other way around.

148
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.654
His proposed wage increase
could ruin all of us.

149
00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:09.573
I need it taken care of soon.
I have people to answer to.

150
00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:12.993
All right, now to the important stuff.

151
00:08:13.077 --> 00:08:15.537
These ain't no slashes, folks.

152
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.289
These are the pure breeds.

153
00:08:17.748 --> 00:08:21.001
Here are the nominees
for Male Model of the Year.

154
00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:24.004
COMMENTATOR:
<i>Young, hot, brash.</i>

155
00:08:24.088 --> 00:08:27.883
<i>With more covers in his first year
than any rookie model ever</i>

156
00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:31.512
<i>and an attitude that says,
"Who cares? It's only fashion."</i>

157
00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:34.223
That Hansel's so hot right now.

158
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:38.310
HANSEL: <i>I hear a lot of words
like "beauty" and "handsomeness,"</i>

159
00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:40.020
<i>and "incredibly chiseled features."</i>

160
00:08:40.104 --> 00:08:42.981
To me, that's like a vanity,
a self-absorption,

161
00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:45.234
that I try to steer clear of.

162
00:08:45.317 --> 00:08:48.362
<i>I dig the bungee.
For me, it's just the way I live my life.</i>

163
00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.031
I grip it and I rip it.
I live it with a lot of flair.

164
00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:53.909
<i>I live it on the edge, where I gotta be.</i>

165
00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:58.330
<i>I wasn't like every other kid,
who dreams about being an astronaut.</i>

166
00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:03.252
I was always more interested in

With your complexion,

all those LexisNexis searches,

00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:32.811
on the male models who've
appeared in Mugatu campaigns.

605
00:38:32.895 --> 00:38:36.273
It's pretty weird. It seems
like all of Mr. Mugatu's models

606

in freak accidents.

I just need to speak
with Derek Zoolander, please!

612
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.728
I just thought the way you handled
losing that award to Hansel,

613
00:39:14.811 --> 00:39:17.523
and then you sort of laid low for a while,

614
00:39:17.606 --> 00:39:19.650
and then made your comeback...

615
00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:21.568
It was so courageous.

616
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.820

617
00:39:23.904 --> 00:39:26.657
