1
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.128
Way out West
there was this fella.

2
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:45.547
Fella I wanna tell you about.

3
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.092
Fella by the name of
Jeff Lebowski.

4
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.804
Least that was the handle
that his loving parents gave him.

5
00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.932
But he never had
much use for it himself.

6
00:00:56.015 --> 00:01:00.061
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

7
00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:02.230
Now Dude,

8
00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:05.984
that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.

9
00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:11.448
But then there was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,

10
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:14.200
and a lot about
where he lived likewise.

11
00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.121
But then again,

12
00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:21.291
maybe that's why I found the place
so darned interesting.

13
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:30.425
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

14
00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:33.553
I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.

15
00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:37.348
But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.

16
00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:40.101
Course, I can't say
I seen London,

17
00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.437
and I never been to France,

18
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.567
and I ain't never seen no queen
in her damned undies, as the fella says.

19
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.569
But I'll tell you what,

20
00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:54.949
after seeing Los Angeles and this here story
I'm about to unfold,

21
00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.869
well, I guess
I've seen something

22
00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:02.123
every bit as stupefying as you can see
in any of those other places,

23
00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:04.375
and in English too.

24
00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.378
So I can die with
a smile on my face

25
00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:10.256
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

26
00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:13.301
Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold

27
00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:16.387
took place back
in the early '90s,

28
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:21.309
just about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.

29
00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:24.979
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

30
00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:27.106
I won't say a hero.

31
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.234
'Cause what's a hero?

32
00:02:29.317 --> 00:02:31.653
But sometimes there's a man...

33
00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:34.739
And I'm talking about
the Dude here.

34
00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:37.492
Sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:42.163
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

36
00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:44.999
He fits right in there.

37
00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:48.461
And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.

38
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:52.173
And even if he is a lazy man,

39
00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:54.884
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

40
00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:58.721
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

41
00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:02.684
which would place him high in the running
for laziest worldwide.

42
00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:06.729
But sometimes there's a man...

43
00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:09.607
Sometimes there's a man...

44
00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:14.487
Well, I lost my train
of thought here.

45
00:03:14.571 --> 00:03:15.822
But...

46
00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:19.158
Hell, I done introduced him
enough.

47
00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:21.578
With them all
for a collective action...

48
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:23.371
This will not stand.

49
00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:26.958
This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.

50
00:03:57.655 --> 00:03:59.949
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

51
00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:02.243
I want that money,
Lebowski.

52
00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:04.787
Bunny says you're
good for it.

53
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.582
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

54
00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:10.043
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

55
00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:12.670
Where's the fucking money,
shithead?

56
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.884
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

57
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:20.553
Don't fuck with us.

58
00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:24.807
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn,

59
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.769
that means you owe money
to Jackie Treehorn.

60
00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:30.063
Ever thus to deadbeats,
Lebowski.

61
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.732
No, don't do...

62
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:37.153
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?

63
00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:40.573
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

64
00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:43.618
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong guy.

65
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.453
I'm the Dude, man.

66
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:48.289
Your name's Lebowski,
Lebowski.

67
00:04:48.373 --> 00:04:50.166
Your wife is Bunny.

68
00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:53.419
My wife? Bunny?

69
00:04:53.503 --> 00:04:55.463
Do you see a wedding ring
on my finger?

70
00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:57.840
Does this place look like
I'm fucking married?

71
00:04:57.924 --> 00:05:00.093
The toilet seat's up, man!

72
00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:10.019
What the fuck is this?

73
00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:12.313
Obviously you're not a golfer.

74
00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.026
- Woo?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.779
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

76
00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:22.365
Fuck.

77
00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:25.576
Yeah. What do you think?

78
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.954
He looks like
a fucking loser.

79
00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:30.790
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

80
00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:32.583
Fucking time-waster.

81
00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:34.544
Thanks a lot, asshole.

82
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.759
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

83
00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:51.347
I'm telling you, this was a valued rug.
This was a...

84
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.975
Yeah, man. It really tied
the room together.

85
00:07:54.058 --> 00:07:55.685
This was a valued...

86
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.520
- What tied the room together, Dude?
- My rug.

87
00:07:57.603 --> 00:07:59.164
Were you listening
to the Dude's story, Donny?

88
00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:00.273
- What?
- Walter.

89
00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:03.067
- Were you listening to the Dude's story?
- I was bowling.

90
00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:05.403
So you have no frame of
reference here, Donny.

91
00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:08.382
You're like a child who wanders into
the middle of a movie and wants to know...

92
00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:11.826
- Walter, what's the point, man?
- There's no reason, here's my point, Dude.

93
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:13.549
There's no fucking reason
why these two...

94
00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:14.847
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

95
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:16.873
Walter, what is the...

96
00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:19.375
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

97
00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.669
What the fuck
are you talking about?

98
00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:24.463
No, what the fuck are you...
I'm not...

99
00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:27.341
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here, Dude.

100
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:29.153
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- My rug.

101
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:30.970
Forget it, Donny!
You're out of your element!

102
00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:33.639
Walter, the Chinaman
who peed on my rug,

103
00:08:33.723 --> 00:08:35.558
I can't go give him a bill!

104
00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:37.310
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

105
00:08:37.393 --> 00:08:38.579
What the fuck are
you talking about?

106
00:08:38.603 --> 00:08:40.730
The Chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude!

107
00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:43.399
I'm talking about drawing
a line in the sand, Dude.

108
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:45.902
Across this line
you do not...

109
00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:50.072
Also, Dude, Chinaman
is not the preferred nomenclature.

110
00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:51.782
Asian-American, please.

111
00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:55.286
Walter, this isn't a guy who built
the railroads here. This is a guy...

112
00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:56.996
What the fuck are you...

113
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.124
- Walter, he peed on my rug!
- He peed on the Dude's rug.

114
00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:01.751
Donny, you're out
of your element.

115
00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:05.129
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

116
00:09:05.213 --> 00:09:07.632
- So, who...
- Jeff Lebowski.

117
00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:10.843
The other Jeffrey Lebowski.
The millionaire.

118
00:09:10.927 --> 00:09:13.679
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

119
00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:17.725
Plus, he has the wealth, obviously,
and the resources,

120
00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:20.353
so that there's no reason,
there's no fucking reason

121
00:09:20.436 --> 00:09:23.147
why his wife should go out
and owe money all over town,

122
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:25.691
and then they come
and they pee on your fucking rug!

123
00:09:25.775 --> 00:09:27.026
- Am I wrong?
- No.

124
00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:28.653
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah, but...

125
00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:29.779
Okay then.

126
00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:34.617
That rug really tied
the room together, did it not?

127
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.619
- Fucking A.
- And this guy peed on it.

128
00:09:36.702 --> 00:09:38.037
Donny, please.

129
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.348
You know, this is
the fucking guy...

130
00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:41.666
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

131
00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:44.085
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

132
00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:48.464
This is the guy who should
compensate me for the fucking rug.

133
00:09:48.547 --> 00:09:52.176
His wife goes out and owes money
all over town, and they pee on my rug?

134
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.303
They pee on
your fucking rug?

135
00:09:54.387 --> 00:09:57.098
- Peed on my fucking rug.
- That's right, Dude.

136
00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:00.851
They peed on
your fucking rug.

137
00:10:02.478 --> 00:10:04.146
This is the study.

138
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.816
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards...

139
00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:10.820
- Jeffrey Lebowski.
- Citations, honorary degrees, et cetera.

140
00:10:10.903 --> 00:10:14.573
- Very impressive.
- Oh, please feel free to inspect them.

141
00:10:14.657 --> 00:10:17.285
- Oh, no, I'm not really...
- Oh, please. Please.

142
00:10:17.368 --> 00:10:19.287
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

143
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.750
which Mr. Lebowski received two years ago
in recognition of his various civic...

144
00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:29.505
That's the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

145
00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:31.757
which is given...
Oh, not necessarily given every year.

146
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:32.925
Hey, is this...

147
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.319
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

148
00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:35.636
Is this him with Nancy?

149
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.973
Yes, indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski
with the first lady, yes.

150
00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.296
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

151
00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:42.977
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

152
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.813
- Of course. Mr. Lebowski, on the left...
- So he's a...

153
00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:48.482
You know, a handicapped
kind of guy?

154
00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:50.735
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.

155
00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:54.572
This picture was taken when
Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation.

156
00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:55.740
Yes, yes.

157
00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.783
- Not of California.
- Good shot.

158
00:10:57.867 --> 00:11:00.077
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

159
00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:02.961
though, unfortunately, there wasn't
enough time for a photo opportunity.

160
00:11:02.997 --> 00:11:04.957
- Oh, Nancy's pretty good.
- Oh, wonderful woman.

161
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:07.335
- We were very happy to...
- These are...

162
00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:10.087
Oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

163
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:11.422
Different mothers, huh?

164
00:11:11.547 --> 00:11:13.841
- No, they're not...
- Racially, he's pretty cool?

165
00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:17.386
They're not literally
his children.

166
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.722
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

167
00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:22.850
inner city children of promise,
but without the necessary means for...

168
00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:24.935
Necessary means for
a higher education,

169
00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:28.439
so Mr. Lebowski is committed to sending
all of them to college.

170
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:29.857
- Excuse me.
- Oh, geez.

171
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.692
Thank you. Thank you.

172
00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:36.280
- Far out. Think he's got room for one more?
- One...

173
00:11:37.948 --> 00:11:39.158
You never went to college.

174
00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:41.386
- Please, don't touch that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I did,

175
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.704
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

176
00:11:43.788 --> 00:11:46.916
occupying various
administration buildings,

177
00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:48.709
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

178
00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:52.046
breaking into the ROTC
and bowling.

179
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:54.382
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

180
00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:03.349
Okay, sir. You're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski.

181
00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:05.184
That's terrific.

182
00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:08.145
But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

183
00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:10.898
What can I do for you, sir?

184
00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:14.527
Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

185
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.612
It really tied
the room together.

186
00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.407
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

187
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.991
Where do I fit in?

188
00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:24.912
Well, they were looking for you,
these two guys.

189
00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:26.956
- You know, they...
- I'll say it again.

190
00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:30.167
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

191
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:32.294
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

192
00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:35.589
Oh, so you know that
they were trying to piss on your rug.

193
00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:37.883
Did I urinate on your rug?

194
00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:40.219
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

195
00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:42.263
Hello! Do you speak
English, sir?

196
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:44.223
¿Parla usted inglés?

197
00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:47.184
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

198
00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.604
No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

199
00:12:50.688 --> 00:12:52.356
I just want to
understand this, sir.

200
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.360
Every time a rug is micturated
upon in this fair city,

201
00:12:56.444 --> 00:12:58.195
I have to compensate
the person?

202
00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:01.490
Come on, man.
I'm not trying to scam anybody here.

203
00:13:01.574 --> 00:13:03.409
You know, I'm just...

204
00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:07.037
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

205
00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:10.666
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

206
00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:14.086
Wait. Let me explain
something to you.

207
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.005
I am not Mr. Lebowski.

208
00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:19.049
You're Mr. Lebowski.
I'm the Dude.

209
00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:21.635
So that's what you call me.
You know?

210
00:13:21.719 --> 00:13:23.804
That or His Dudeness,

211
00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:26.348
or Duder or, you know,

212
00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:29.477
El Duderino, if you're not
into the whole brevity thing.

213
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.562
Are you employed, sir?

214
00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:34.231
Employed?

215
00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:40.154
You don't go out looking for a job
dressed like that, do you? On a weekday?

216
00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:41.614
Is this a...

217
00:13:41.697 --> 00:13:44.825
- What day is this?
- Well, I do work, sir.

218
00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:49.079
- So, if you don't mind...
- No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

219
00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:50.915
This will not stand, you know.

220
00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:53.501
This aggression
will not stand, man.

221
00:13:53.584 --> 00:13:55.336
I mean,
your wife owes money...

222
00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:58.380
My wife is not
the issue here!

223
00:13:58.464 --> 00:14:01.842
I hope that someday my wife
will learn to live on her allowance,

224
00:14:01.926 --> 00:14:03.344
which is ample.

225
00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:06.263
But if she does not,
that is her problem, not mine,

226
00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:07.973
just as the rug
is your problem.

227
00:14:08.057 --> 00:14:12.019
Just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,

228
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.813
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

229
00:14:14.897 --> 00:14:17.983
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

230
00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:20.528
Some Chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

231
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:23.030
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

232
00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:27.493
I cannot solve your problems, sir.
Only you can.

233
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.039
- Well, fuck it.
- Oh, fuck it.

234
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:35.209
Yes, that's your answer.
That's your answer to everything.

235
00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:37.044
Tattoo it on your forehead!

236
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.588
Your revolution is over,
Mr. Lebowski!

237
00:14:39.672 --> 00:14:42.925
Condolences! The bums lost!

238
00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:46.220
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

239
00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:48.097
Get a job, sir!

240
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.724
The bums will
always lose!

241
00:14:50.808 --> 00:14:52.560
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?

242
00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:55.062
The bums will
always lose.

243
00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:58.607
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

244
00:14:58.691 --> 00:15:00.192
Okay.

245
00:15:00.276 --> 00:15:02.778
The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

246
00:15:03.571 --> 00:15:05.114
Well, enjoy.

247
00:15:05.197 --> 00:15:07.741
And perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

248
00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:08.951
Yeah, sure.

249
00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.912
If I'm in the neighborhood,
you know,

250
00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:15.583
and I need to use the john.

251
00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.387
Blow on them.

252
00:15:28.846 --> 00:15:30.723
Go ahead. Blow.

253
00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:35.853
You want me to blow
on your toes?

254
00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:40.024
I can't blow that far.

255
00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:48.282
Are you sure he won't mind?

256
00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.452
Uli doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

257
00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:53.787
Oh, that must be exhausting.

258
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:55.623
You're not blowing.

259
00:15:55.706 --> 00:15:58.459
Our guest has to be getting along,
Mrs. Lebowski.

260
00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.920
You're Bunny.

261
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.382
I'll suck your cock
for $1,000.

262
00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:11.722
Wonderful woman.

263
00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.932
We're all very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

264
00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:16.727
Brandt can't watch though,
or he has to pay $100.

265
00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.897
That's marvelous.

266
00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:24.902
I'm just gonna go
find a cash machine.

267
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.575
I'm slamming them tonight!

268
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:33.952
You guys are dead
in the water.

269
00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:36.997
All right!
Way to go, Donny!

270
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.417
If you will it,
it is no dream.

271
00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:43.921
Fucking 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

272
00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.006
Theodore Herzl.

273
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.176
State of Israel. If you will it, Dude,
it is no dream.

274
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.136
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

275
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.098
The carrier. What's in
the fucking carrier?

276
00:16:54.223 --> 00:16:57.142
Cynthia's dog.
Think it's a Pomeranian.

277
00:16:57.226 --> 00:16:59.266
Can't leave him home alone
or he eats the furniture.

278
00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:02.064
I'm watching it while Cynthia and Marty
Ackerman are in Hawaii.

279
00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.066
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

280
00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:05.693
What do you mean,
brought it bowling?

281
00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:08.779
I didn't rent it shoes.
I'm not buying it a fucking beer.

282
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.948
He's not taking your
fucking turn, Dude.

283
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.368
Man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me
to take care of her fucking dog

284
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.211
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

285
00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.872
I'd tell her to go fuck herself.
Why can't she board it?

286
00:17:18.956 --> 00:17:20.791
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

287
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:24.044
Secondly, this is a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.

288
00:17:24.128 --> 00:17:26.839
You can't board it.
It gets upset. Its hair falls out.

289
00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:29.258
- Walter...
- Fucking dog has fucking papers.

290
00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:32.010
Over the line!

291
00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:34.430
I'm sorry, Smokey. You were over the line.
That's a foul.

292
00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:36.181
Bullshit. Mark it eight, Dude.

293
00:17:36.265 --> 00:17:39.393
Excuse me. Mark it zero.
Next frame.

294
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.396
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it eight, Dude.

295
00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.065
Smokey, this is not Nam.
This is bowling. There are rules.

296
00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:47.901
Hey, Walter, come on.
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

297
00:17:47.985 --> 00:17:50.154
So his toe slipped over
a little, you know.

298
00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:52.406
- It's just a game, man.
- This is a league game.

299
00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.408
This determines who enters
the next round robin.

300
00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:56.251
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah, but I wasn't...

301
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.871
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah, but I wasn't over.

302
00:17:58.954 --> 00:18:01.665
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an eight.

303
00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:03.500
Smokey, my friend...

304
00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:07.296
- You're entering a world of pain.
- Walter, man.

305
00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:11.091
You mark that frame an eight,
you're entering a world of pain.

306
00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:13.761
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.

307
00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:15.929
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

308
00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:18.390
Has the whole world
gone crazy?

309
00:18:18.474 --> 00:18:21.226
Am I the only one around here
who gives a shit about the rules?

310
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.561
Mark it zero!

311
00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.831
They're calling the cops, man.
Put the piece away.

312
00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:27.900
- Mark it zero!
- Walter, put the piece away.

313
00:18:27.983 --> 00:18:30.194
- Walter.
- You think I'm fucking around here?

314
00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:31.904
Mark it zero!

315
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.954
All right. It's fucking zero.

316
00:18:41.038 --> 00:18:43.123
You happy,
you crazy fuck?

317
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:47.503
It's a league game, Smokey.

318
00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:50.881
You can't do that, man.

319
00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.675
These guys, you know,
they're like me, they're pacifists.

320
00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:56.345
Smokey was a
conscientious objector.

321
00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:59.264
You know, Dude, I myself dabbled
in pacifism at one point.

322
00:18:59.348 --> 00:19:00.641
Not in Nam, of course.

323
00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:04.186
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

324
00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.688
You mean, beyond pacifism?

325
00:19:06.772 --> 00:19:09.483
He's fragile.
He's very fragile.

326
00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.071
I did not know that.

327
00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:17.032
Well, it's all water
under the bridge.

328
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:20.118
And we do enter
the next round robin.

329
00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:22.496
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.

330
00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.331
- Am I wrong?
- You're not wrong, Walter.

331
00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:25.791
You're just an asshole.

332
00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:27.334
Okay then.

333
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.044
Play Quintana and
O'Brien next week.

334
00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.046
They should be pushovers.

335
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:34.675
Man, would you just...

336
00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:36.510
Just take it easy, man.

337
00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:38.887
You know, that's your answer
for everything, Dude.

338
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:41.849
Let me point out something.
Pacifism is not...

339
00:19:41.932 --> 00:19:44.768
Look at our current situation
with that camel fucker in Iraq.

340
00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:46.812
Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.

341
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.273
Just take it easy, man.

342
00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:51.733
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

343
00:19:51.817 --> 00:19:55.279
- Yeah, waving the fucking gun around?
- Calmer than you are.

344
00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.281
Will you just take it easy?

345
00:19:58.115 --> 00:19:59.908
Calmer than you are.

346
00:20:04.246 --> 00:20:05.873
Dude, this is Smokey.

347
00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:07.875
Look, I don't wanna be
a hard-on about this,

348
00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.209
and I know
it wasn't your fault,

349
00:20:09.293 --> 00:20:10.933
but I just thought
it was fair to tell you

350
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:13.171
that Gilbert and I will be
submitting this to the league

351
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:15.465
and asking them
to set aside the round.

352
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:18.218
I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.

353
00:20:18.302 --> 00:20:21.555
So, like I say, just thought,
you know, fair warning.

354
00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:23.098
Tell Walter.

355
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:24.433
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.645
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Brandt at...

357
00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:32.190
Well, at Mr. Lebowski's
office.

358
00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:34.776
Please call us
as soon as it's convenient.

359
00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.572
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Mel Zelnicker

360
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.115
of the Southern Cal
Bowling League.

361
00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:45.454
I just got an informal report that
a member of your team, a Walter Sobchak,

362
00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.789
drew a firearm
during league play.

363
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.517
If this is true, of course,

364
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.311
it contravenes a number of
the league's bylaws

365
00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:53.045
and also article 27
of the league...

366
00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.798
- Dude.
- Hey, Marty.

367
00:20:56.882 --> 00:20:58.634
Dude, I finally got...

368
00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.011
I got the venue I wanted.

369
00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:05.015
I'm performing my dance quintet,
you know, my cycle,

370
00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.851
at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street
Theater on Tuesday night.

371
00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:12.189
And, well, I'd love it if
you came and gave me notes.

372
00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.733
I'll be there, man.

373
00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.905
Dude, tomorrow's
already the tenth.

374
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.532
Far out.

375
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.329
Oh, all right. Okay.

376
00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:30.207
Just slip the rent
under my door.

377
00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:36.421
Serious infraction
and examine your standing.

378
00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:38.006
Thank you.

379
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.219
Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.

380
00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:45.722
Please do call us as soon as
you get in and I'll send the limo.

381
00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:49.393
I hope you're not avoiding
this call because of the rug,

382
00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:52.145
which I assure you
is not a problem.

383
00:21:52.229 --> 00:21:54.856
We need your help, and...

384
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.902
Well, we would very much like
to see you. Thank you. It's Brandt.

385
00:22:00.237 --> 00:22:01.697
We've had some
terrible news.

386
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.991
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion
in the west wing.

387
00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:09.955
Mr. Lebowski.

388
00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.213
Funny.

389
00:22:19.423 --> 00:22:23.218
I can look back on
a life of achievement,

390
00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:25.512
challenges met,

391
00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:27.639
competitors bested,

392
00:22:27.723 --> 00:22:29.433
obstacles overcome.

393
00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:34.396
I've accomplished
more than most men

394
00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:36.773
and without
the use of my legs.

395
00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:44.239
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

396
00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:46.950
Dude.

397
00:22:48.994 --> 00:22:51.663
Oh, I don't know, sir.

398
00:22:51.747 --> 00:22:54.624
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing,

399
00:22:56.752 --> 00:22:58.420
whatever the cost?

400
00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.381
Isn't that what
makes a man?

401
00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:05.010
Sure, that and
a pair of testicles.

402
00:23:05.594 --> 00:23:07.387
You're joking,

403
00:23:09.639 --> 00:23:11.266
but perhaps you're right.

404
00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:13.268
You mind if I do a Jay?

405
00:23:15.187 --> 00:23:16.354
Bunny.

406
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.775
Excuse me?

407
00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:21.651
Bunny Lebowski.

408
00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:24.905
She is the light of my life.

409
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.992
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

410
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.788
Oh, fucking A.

411
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:35.373
Strong men also cry.

412
00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:40.003
Strong men also cry.

413
00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:45.509
I received
this fax this morning.

414
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.099
As you can see,
it is a ransom note.

415
00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:55.102
We have Bunny.

416
00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:59.439
Written by men who were unable to achieve
on a level field of play.

417
00:23:59.523 --> 00:24:02.150
Gather $1 million...

418
00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:05.654
- Cowards!
- In unmarked, nonconsecutive 20s.

419
00:24:05.737 --> 00:24:08.448
- Weaklings!
- Await instructions.

420
00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:10.325
- Bums!
- No funny stuff.

421
00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:13.578
Bummer.

422
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.542
This is a bummer, man.
That's... That's a bummer.

423
00:24:19.334 --> 00:24:22.045
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

424
00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:41.356
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make
a generous offer to you to act as courier

425
00:24:41.439 --> 00:24:43.984
once we get instructions
for the money.

426
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:45.235
Why me, man?

427
00:24:45.318 --> 00:24:50.824
He believes the culprits might be
the very people who soiled your rug

428
00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:55.829
and you are in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm that suspicion.

429
00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:57.664
He thinks the carpet pissers
did this?

430
00:24:57.747 --> 00:24:59.666
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

431
00:26:36.888 --> 00:26:38.765
Fucking Quintana.

432
00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:42.060
That creep can roll, man.

433
00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:45.188
- Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.
- Yeah.

434
00:26:46.147 --> 00:26:49.067
No, he's a sex offender
with a record.

435
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.112
He did six months in Chino for
exposing himself to an eight-year-old.

436
00:26:53.613 --> 00:26:55.549
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door-to-door

437
00:26:55.573 --> 00:26:57.367
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

438
00:26:58.326 --> 00:27:01.830
- What's a pederast, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

439
00:27:04.165 --> 00:27:06.751
So, how much
did he give you?

440
00:27:06.835 --> 00:27:10.088
20 grand, man. And, of course,
I still get to keep the rug.

441
00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:11.607
- Just for making a hand-off?
- Yeah.

442
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:14.009
They gave Dude a beeper.

443
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.804
- So whenever these guys call...
- What if it's during a game?

444
00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:20.515
Oh, I told them if it was during
league play...

445
00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:21.725
What's during league play?

446
00:27:21.808 --> 00:27:24.269
Life does not stop and start
at your convenience,

447
00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:26.271
you miserable piece of shit.

448
00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:28.315
- I figure...
- What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

449
00:27:28.398 --> 00:27:30.900
I figure it's easy money, you know.
It's all pretty harmless.

450
00:27:30.984 --> 00:27:32.819
She probably
kidnapped herself.

451
00:27:33.778 --> 00:27:36.656
- What do you mean, Dude?
- Rug-peers did not do this.

452
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.619
Look at it. A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

453
00:27:41.703 --> 00:27:44.539
She figures he isn't giving
her enough, you know.

454
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:46.374
She owes money
all over town.

455
00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:48.626
That fucking bitch!

456
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.503
It's all a goddamn
fake, man.

457
00:27:50.587 --> 00:27:52.505
It's like Lenin said,

458
00:27:52.589 --> 00:27:57.552
you look for the person
who will benefit and, you know...

459
00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:00.263
- I Am the Walrus?
- You know, you'll...

460
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.970
- You know what I'm trying to say.
- I Am the Walrus.

461
00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:05.810
- That fucking bitch!
- Oh, yeah!

462
00:28:05.894 --> 00:28:07.312
- I Am the Walrus.
- That's...

463
00:28:07.395 --> 00:28:08.897
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

464
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.025
V.I. Lenin, Vladimir
Ilyich Ulyanov!

465
00:28:12.108 --> 00:28:13.336
What the fuck is
he talking about?

466
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.195
Fucking exactly what
happened to those...

467
00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:16.821
That makes me
fucking sick!

468
00:28:16.946 --> 00:28:19.866
- Well, what do you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.

469
00:28:19.949 --> 00:28:21.910
This whole fucking thing.

470
00:28:21.993 --> 00:28:24.746
I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck

471
00:28:24.829 --> 00:28:26.581
so that this
fucking strumpet,

472
00:28:26.664 --> 00:28:27.892
this fucking whore,
could waltz around...

473
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:30.335
I don't see any connection
with Vietnam, man.

474
00:28:30.418 --> 00:28:32.104
Well, there isn't a
literal connection, Dude.

475
00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:34.047
No, Walter, face it,
there isn't any connection.

476
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.590
- Your roll.
- Have it your way.

477
00:28:35.673 --> 00:28:37.008
- Your roll.
- But my point is...

478
00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:39.886
- My point is...
- Are you ready to be fucked, man?

479
00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:44.349
I see you rolled your way
into the semis.

480
00:28:45.392 --> 00:28:47.727
Dios mío, man.

481
00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:50.647
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

482
00:28:51.147 --> 00:28:56.945
Yeah? Well, you know,
that's just like your opinion, man.

483
00:28:58.154 --> 00:29:01.241
Let me tell you
something, pendejo.

484
00:29:01.324 --> 00:29:03.535
You pull any of your
crazy shit with us,

485
00:29:03.618 --> 00:29:06.413
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

486
00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:09.416
I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass

487
00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:12.710
and pull the fucking trigger
till it goes click.

488
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:15.922
Jesus.

489
00:29:16.005 --> 00:29:17.674
You said it, man.

490
00:29:17.757 --> 00:29:20.009
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

491
00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:27.684
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

492
00:31:32.183 --> 00:31:33.744
They called
about 80 minutes ago.

493
00:31:33.768 --> 00:31:36.396
They want you to take the money,
drive north on the 405.

494
00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:37.873
They will call you
on the portable phone

495
00:31:37.897 --> 00:31:39.983
with instructions
in about 40 minutes.

496
00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:41.150
One person only.

497
00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:43.754
They were very clear on that,
or I'd go with you. One person only.

498
00:31:43.778 --> 00:31:46.781
- What happened to your jaw?
- Oh, nothing, man.

499
00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:49.951
Here's the money.

500
00:31:50.785 --> 00:31:52.412
And the phone.

501
00:31:52.495 --> 00:31:55.331
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

502
00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:58.209
- All right.
- Her life is in your hands.

503
00:31:58.293 --> 00:31:59.919
Man, don't say that.

504
00:32:00.003 --> 00:32:02.589
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that,
her life is in your hands.

505
00:32:02.672 --> 00:32:04.007
Oh, shit, man.

506
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.426
Her life is in
your hands, Dude.

507
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:09.178
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

508
00:32:18.688 --> 00:32:22.942
- Where the fuck are you going, man?
- Take the ringer, I'll drive.

509
00:32:23.026 --> 00:32:25.236
- The what?
- The ringer.

510
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.946
The ringer, Dude.

511
00:32:34.704 --> 00:32:36.664
- What the...
- Have they called yet?

512
00:32:36.748 --> 00:32:38.541
What the hell is this?

513
00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.502
My dirty undies, Dude.
The laundry. The whites.

514
00:32:41.586 --> 00:32:45.715
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies, man.

515
00:32:45.798 --> 00:32:47.091
That's right, Dude.
The weight.

516
00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:48.468
The ringer cannot look empty.

517
00:32:48.551 --> 00:32:50.637
Walter, what the fuck
are you thinking, man?

518
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.639
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking.

519
00:32:52.722 --> 00:32:55.558
I got to thinking, why should we settle
for a measly fucking 20 grand...

520
00:32:55.642 --> 00:32:58.853
We? What the fuck, we?
You said you just wanted to come along.

521
00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:01.314
My point, Dude,
is why should we settle for 20 grand

522
00:33:01.397 --> 00:33:04.067
when we can keep the entire million?
Am I wrong?

523
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.236
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a fucking game, man.

524
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.656
Oh, but it is a game.
You said so yourself.

525
00:33:09.739 --> 00:33:11.949
- She kidnapped herself.
- I said I thought...

526
00:33:18.206 --> 00:33:20.286
- Dude, here.
- Who is this?

527
00:33:21.668 --> 00:33:24.629
Dude. The bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

528
00:33:24.712 --> 00:33:25.755
Us?

529
00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:28.466
Shit!

530
00:33:30.385 --> 00:33:33.012
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

531
00:33:33.096 --> 00:33:36.849
I'm not handling the money, driving the car
and talking on the phone all by my...

532
00:33:36.933 --> 00:33:38.184
Shut the fuck up!

533
00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:41.270
- Dude, are you fucking this up?
- Who is that?

534
00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:45.191
That is the driver.
I told you...

535
00:33:46.943 --> 00:33:48.861
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck's going on?

536
00:33:48.945 --> 00:33:50.381
- Walter...
- What the fuck is going on?

537
00:33:50.405 --> 00:33:54.701
He hung up, man.
You fucked it up. You fucked it up!

538
00:33:54.826 --> 00:33:57.370
- Her life was in our hands, man.
- Easy, Dude.

539
00:33:57.453 --> 00:34:01.332
We're screwed now. We don't get shit.
They're gonna kill her.

540
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:04.127
- We're fucked, Walter.
- Nothing is fucked, Dude.

541
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.713
Come on.
You're being very un-Dude.

542
00:34:06.796 --> 00:34:09.215
They'll call back.
Look, she kidnapped...

543
00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:12.385
You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.

544
00:34:12.468 --> 00:34:16.347
Nothing is fucked.
They're a bunch of fucking amateurs.

545
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:18.933
Walter, will you just
shut the fuck up?

546
00:34:19.016 --> 00:34:21.394
Don't say peep while
I'm doing business here, man.

547
00:34:21.477 --> 00:34:23.438
Okay, Dude.
Have it your way.

548
00:34:25.523 --> 00:34:27.984
- But they're amateurs.
- Fuck.

549
00:34:29.569 --> 00:34:30.737
Dude.

550
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.073
Okay, we proceed
but only if there is no funny stuff.

551
00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:35.700
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:37.869
So no funny stuff. Okay?

553
00:34:37.952 --> 00:34:40.538
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

554
00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:46.377
That was the sign, man.

555
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:50.173
So, all we gotta do
is get her back.

556
00:34:50.256 --> 00:34:52.633
No one's in a position
to complain.

557
00:34:52.717 --> 00:34:55.136
- We keep the baksheesh.
- Yeah, terrific, Walter.

558
00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.889
But you haven't told me how we're gonna
get her back. Where is she?

559
00:34:57.972 --> 00:34:59.807
That's the simple part, Dude.

560
00:34:59.891 --> 00:35:04.187
We make the hand-off, I grab one of them
and beat it out of him.

561
00:35:05.313 --> 00:35:07.940
That's a great plan, Walter.

562
00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:10.184
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

563
00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:12.195
It's a Swiss fucking watch.

564
00:35:12.278 --> 00:35:15.406
That's right, Dude.
The beauty of this is its simplicity.

565
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.743
Once a plan gets too complex,
everything can go wrong.

566
00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:20.578
If there's one thing
I learned in Nam...

567
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.625
Dude.

568
00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:27.543
You are coming
to wooden bridge.

569
00:35:27.627 --> 00:35:28.795
When you cross the bridge,

570
00:35:28.878 --> 00:35:32.173
you throw the bag from the left
window of the moving car.

571
00:35:32.256 --> 00:35:33.299
You're being watched.

572
00:35:34.634 --> 00:35:36.969
- Fuck.
- What'd he say? Where's the hand-off?

573
00:35:37.053 --> 00:35:38.721
There is no fucking
hand-off, man.

574
00:35:38.805 --> 00:35:41.474
At the wooden bridge
we throw the money out of the car.

575
00:35:41.557 --> 00:35:44.393
We throw the money
out of the moving car.

576
00:35:44.936 --> 00:35:47.605
We can't do that, Dude.
That fucks up our plan.

577
00:35:47.688 --> 00:35:49.608
Well, call them up
and explain it to them, Walter.

578
00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:50.942
Your plan is
so fucking simple,

579
00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:52.819
I'm sure they'll
fucking understand it.

580
00:35:52.902 --> 00:35:54.028
That's the beauty of it.

581
00:35:54.153 --> 00:35:56.553
- Wooden bridge, huh?
- Throw them the money, Walter.

582
00:35:56.614 --> 00:35:58.157
We're not fucking around, man.

583
00:35:58.241 --> 00:36:00.552
Okay, Dude, the bridge is coming up.
Give me the ringer, chop-chop.

584
00:36:00.576 --> 00:36:02.119
Fuck that.
Walter, I love you,

585
00:36:02.203 --> 00:36:05.289
but sooner or later you're gonna have to
face the fact you're a goddamn moron.

586
00:36:05.373 --> 00:36:07.708
- Okay, Dude. No time to argue.
- Hey, man!

587
00:36:07.792 --> 00:36:10.169
- Here's the bridge.
- Hey, Walter! Hey, Walter!

588
00:36:10.253 --> 00:36:12.964
- Hey, Walter!
- Here goes the ringer!

589
00:36:14.257 --> 00:36:16.467
- What the fuck?
- Okay, Dude, you're wheel.

590
00:36:16.551 --> 00:36:18.719
- Hey, man, what the fuck?
- At 15mph, I roll out.

591
00:36:18.803 --> 00:36:20.781
I double back, grab one of them
and beat it out of him.

592
00:36:20.805 --> 00:36:22.014
- The Uzi.
- Uzi.

593
00:36:22.098 --> 00:36:24.243
You didn't think I was rolling
out of here naked, did you?

594
00:36:24.267 --> 00:36:26.907
- Walter, please!
- Fifteen, Dude! This is it! Let's take that hill!

595
00:36:26.978 --> 00:36:28.271
Walter!

596
00:36:51.085 --> 00:36:53.796
We have it!

597
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.382
We have it!

598
00:36:56.465 --> 00:36:58.426
We have it!

599
00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:14.984
Fuck it, Dude.

600
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:16.652
Let's go bowling.

601
00:37:55.149 --> 00:37:58.444
Aitz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

602
00:37:58.527 --> 00:38:00.321
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

603
00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:03.491
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

604
00:38:03.574 --> 00:38:05.701
Oh, him.

605
00:38:05.785 --> 00:38:08.788
I don't know.
What exactly is the problem?

606
00:38:08.871 --> 00:38:10.706
The problem is...

607
00:38:11.999 --> 00:38:13.751
What do you mean,
what's the...

608
00:38:13.834 --> 00:38:15.378
There was no...

609
00:38:16.212 --> 00:38:17.797
We didn't...

610
00:38:18.881 --> 00:38:21.092
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man!

611
00:38:21.175 --> 00:38:23.010
What the fuck
are you talking about?

612
00:38:23.094 --> 00:38:25.638
The poor woman,
that poor slut kidnapped herself.

613
00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:27.074
Come on, Dude.
You said so yourself.

614
00:38:27.098 --> 00:38:29.392
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

615
00:38:29.475 --> 00:38:31.035
You're the one who's
so fucking certain.

616
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.604
That's right, Dude.
100% certain.

617
00:38:33.688 --> 00:38:35.457
They posted the next round
for the tournament.

618
00:38:35.481 --> 00:38:36.732
Donny, shut the fuck...

619
00:38:36.816 --> 00:38:38.818
- When do we play?
- This Saturday. Quintana and...

620
00:38:38.901 --> 00:38:40.653
Saturday?
Well, they'll have to reschedule.

621
00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:43.072
Walter, what am I gonna
tell Lebowski?

622
00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:46.492
I told that fuck down at the league office.
Who's in charge of scheduling?

623
00:38:46.575 --> 00:38:48.119
- Walter!
- Burkhalter.

624
00:38:48.202 --> 00:38:51.163
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times,
I don't roll on shabbos!

625
00:38:51.247 --> 00:38:52.599
- Walter!
- They already posted it.

626
00:38:52.623 --> 00:38:54.208
Well, they can
fucking un-post it!

627
00:38:54.291 --> 00:38:57.586
Who gives a shit? They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man!

628
00:38:57.712 --> 00:38:59.964
- What am I gonna tell Lebowski?
- Come on, Dude.

629
00:39:00.047 --> 00:39:03.050
Eventually she'll get tired of her little
game and, you know, wander on back.

630
00:39:03.134 --> 00:39:04.736
How come you don't roll
on Saturday, Walter?

631
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.886
I'm shomer shabbos.

632
00:39:06.012 --> 00:39:07.972
- What's that, Walter?
- Yeah, and in the meantime,

633
00:39:08.014 --> 00:39:09.432
what do I tell Lebowski?

634
00:39:09.515 --> 00:39:11.851
Saturday, Donny, is shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

635
00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:14.395
That means I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

636
00:39:14.478 --> 00:39:15.980
I don't fucking
ride in a car,

637
00:39:16.063 --> 00:39:17.898
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven

638
00:39:17.982 --> 00:39:20.109
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

639
00:39:21.027 --> 00:39:22.111
Sheesh.

640
00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:23.738
Shomer shabbos!

641
00:39:25.656 --> 00:39:28.325
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking shabbos!

642
00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:31.704
- Oh, fuck! That's it. I'm out of here.
- Oh, come on, Dude.

643
00:39:33.748 --> 00:39:35.624
Dude! Dude!

644
00:39:37.877 --> 00:39:39.211
You just tell him...

645
00:39:39.295 --> 00:39:41.672
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went, you know...

646
00:39:41.756 --> 00:39:42.798
Oh, yeah.
How'd it go?

647
00:39:42.882 --> 00:39:44.802
Went all right. Dude's car got
a little dinged up.

648
00:39:44.842 --> 00:39:47.219
Walter, we didn't make
the fucking hand-off, man!

649
00:39:47.303 --> 00:39:49.388
They didn't get
the fucking money!

650
00:39:49.472 --> 00:39:50.741
And they're gonna...
they're gonna...

651
00:39:50.765 --> 00:39:52.349
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

652
00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:55.102
They're gonna kill
that poor woman!

653
00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:56.645
Walter, if you can't
ride in a car,

654
00:39:56.729 --> 00:39:58.165
then how do you get
around on shabbos?

655
00:39:58.189 --> 00:40:00.232
Really, Dude,
you surprise me.

656
00:40:00.316 --> 00:40:01.609
They're not gonna
kill shit.

657
00:40:01.692 --> 00:40:02.818
They're not gonna do shit.

658
00:40:02.902 --> 00:40:04.588
What can they do to her?
Bunch of fucking amateurs.

659
00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:06.447
And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.

660
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.783
Who's sitting on a million
fucking dollars?

661
00:40:08.866 --> 00:40:09.992
- Am I wrong?
- Walter.

662
00:40:10.076 --> 00:40:13.120
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars
sitting in the trunk of our car?

663
00:40:13.245 --> 00:40:16.248
- Our car, Walter?
- And what do they got? My dirty undies.

664
00:40:16.332 --> 00:40:18.000
My fucking whites!

665
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.424
Say, Dude?

666
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.219
Where is your car?

667
00:40:28.344 --> 00:40:31.472
- Who's got your undies, Walter?
- Where's your car, Dude?

668
00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:33.682
You don't know, Walter?

669
00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:38.062
It was parked in a handicap zone.
Perhaps they towed it.

670
00:40:38.979 --> 00:40:41.690
You fucking know
it's been stolen.

671
00:40:41.774 --> 00:40:44.693
Well, certainly that's
a possibility, Dude.

672
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.488
Oh, fuck it.

673
00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:53.452
- Where you going, Dude?
- I'm going home, Donny.

674
00:40:53.536 --> 00:40:56.705
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny!

675
00:41:12.388 --> 00:41:13.514
Yeah.

676
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:20.020
Green with some brown,
rust coloration.

677
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.358
And was there anything
of value in the car?

678
00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:25.901
Oh, yeah.

679
00:41:27.278 --> 00:41:31.615
A tape deck, some Creedence
tapes, and there was a...

680
00:41:34.201 --> 00:41:35.744
My briefcase.

681
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.957
In the briefcase?

682
00:41:42.084 --> 00:41:43.252
Papers.

683
00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.588
Just papers.

684
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:49.967
You know, my papers,
business papers.

685
00:41:51.635 --> 00:41:54.972
- And what do you do, sir?
- I'm unemployed.

686
00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:01.270
My rug was also stolen.

687
00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:03.647
Your rug was in the car?

688
00:42:03.731 --> 00:42:05.441
No. Here.

689
00:42:06.108 --> 00:42:07.776
Separate incidents.

690
00:42:09.778 --> 00:42:11.530
The Dude is not in.

691
00:42:11.614 --> 00:42:14.450
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

692
00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:16.869
Sometimes.

693
00:42:17.703 --> 00:42:20.164
Wouldn't hold out much hope
for the tape deck though.

694
00:42:20.247 --> 00:42:21.957
Or the Creedence.

695
00:42:22.124 --> 00:42:26.086
What about the briefcase?

696
00:42:26.629 --> 00:42:28.106
Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

697
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.108
Call when you get home
and I'll send a car for you.

698
00:42:30.132 --> 00:42:33.761
My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.

699
00:42:33.844 --> 00:42:36.931
Well, guess we can close the file
on that one.

700
00:43:28.524 --> 00:43:31.443
I'll be with you in
a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

701
00:43:49.962 --> 00:43:53.382
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

702
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:57.261
- Is that what this is a picture of?
- In a sense, yes.

703
00:43:57.344 --> 00:44:00.014
My art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal,

704
00:44:00.097 --> 00:44:01.181
which bothers some men.

705
00:44:01.265 --> 00:44:04.226
The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.

706
00:44:04.727 --> 00:44:06.812
- Vagina.
- Oh, yeah?

707
00:44:06.895 --> 00:44:09.315
Yes, they don't like hearing it
and find it difficult to say,

708
00:44:09.398 --> 00:44:10.774
whereas without
batting an eye,

709
00:44:10.858 --> 00:44:15.070
a man will refer to his dick,
or his rod or his johnson.

710
00:44:16.322 --> 00:44:17.323
Johnson?

711
00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:20.117
All right, Mr. Lebowski,
let's get down to cases.

712
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.661
My father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug,

713
00:44:22.745 --> 00:44:26.707
but as it was a gift from me to
my late mother, it was not his to give.

714
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.709
Now, your face.

715
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.879
As for this kidnapping.

716
00:44:33.088 --> 00:44:36.508
Yes, I know all about it,
and I know that you acted as courier.

717
00:44:36.592 --> 00:44:39.845
Let me tell you something.
The whole thing stinks to high heaven.

718
00:44:39.928 --> 00:44:44.141
Yeah, right, but let me explain
something about the rug.

719
00:44:44.224 --> 00:44:46.435
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

720
00:44:47.436 --> 00:44:50.689
- Excuse me?
- Sex, the physical act of love. Coitus.

721
00:44:50.814 --> 00:44:54.026
- Do you like it?
- I was talking about my rug.

722
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:56.653
You're not interested in sex?

723
00:44:56.737 --> 00:44:59.031
- You mean coitus?
- I like it too.

724
00:44:59.114 --> 00:45:01.367
It's a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

725
00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.869
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

726
00:45:03.952 --> 00:45:05.371
However, there are
some people,

727
00:45:05.454 --> 00:45:08.374
it is called satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women,

728
00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:11.627
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

729
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:14.713
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

730
00:45:14.797 --> 00:45:18.717
These unfortunate souls cannot love,
in the true sense of the word.

731
00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:22.262
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

732
00:45:22.346 --> 00:45:24.556
Listen, Maude,

733
00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.851
I'm sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho,

734
00:45:27.935 --> 00:45:31.313
but, you know, I don't see
what this has to do with...

735
00:45:31.397 --> 00:45:34.191
- You have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.

736
00:45:37.736 --> 00:45:39.571
Oh, I know that guy.

737
00:45:41.156 --> 00:45:43.367
He's a nihilist.

738
00:45:44.952 --> 00:45:46.662
Karl Hungus.

739
00:46:00.426 --> 00:46:01.844
- Hi.
- Hello.

740
00:46:01.927 --> 00:46:04.888
Mein dispatcher says there is
something wrong with dein Kabel.

741
00:46:04.972 --> 00:46:06.098
Yeah. Come on in.

742
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:08.621
I'm not really sure exactly
what's really wrong with the cable.

743
00:46:08.684 --> 00:46:11.270
That's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

744
00:46:11.353 --> 00:46:12.688
The TV's in here.

745
00:46:12.729 --> 00:46:15.941
- You recognize her, of course.
- Helga, bring my tools.

746
00:46:18.861 --> 00:46:20.612
That's my friend Sherry.

747
00:46:20.696 --> 00:46:22.364
She just came over
to use the shower.

748
00:46:22.448 --> 00:46:24.783
The story is ludicrous.

749
00:46:24.867 --> 00:46:27.828
My name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.

750
00:46:27.911 --> 00:46:29.955
You must be here
to fix the cable.

751
00:46:30.038 --> 00:46:32.916
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

752
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.460
He fixes the cable?

753
00:46:34.543 --> 00:46:36.587
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

754
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.965
Little matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career in pornography,

755
00:46:40.048 --> 00:46:42.676
nor that she has been
banging Jackie Treehorn,

756
00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:44.511
to use the parlance
of our times.

757
00:46:44.595 --> 00:46:48.557
However, I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

758
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.309
the other being my father.

759
00:46:50.392 --> 00:46:52.352
The foundation takes
youngsters from Watts and...

760
00:46:52.436 --> 00:46:53.812
Shit, yeah. The achievers.

761
00:46:53.896 --> 00:46:57.608
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes,
and proud we are of all of them.

762
00:46:57.691 --> 00:47:01.528
I asked my father about his withdrawal
of $1 million from the foundation account,

763
00:47:01.612 --> 00:47:03.447
and he told me
about this abduction,

764
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.157
but I tell you
it is preposterous.

765
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.161
This compulsive fornicator is taking
my father for the proverbial ride.

766
00:47:09.244 --> 00:47:11.163
- Yeah, but my...
- I'm getting to your rug.

767
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:12.998
My father and I don't get along.

768
00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:14.708
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle and,

769
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:16.460
needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

770
00:47:16.543 --> 00:47:20.339
However, I hardly wish to make my father's
embezzlement a police matter.

771
00:47:20.422 --> 00:47:23.300
So I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

772
00:47:23.383 --> 00:47:25.511
from the people
you delivered it to.

773
00:47:25.594 --> 00:47:28.514
Well, I could do that.

774
00:47:28.597 --> 00:47:30.474
If you successfully do so,

775
00:47:30.557 --> 00:47:35.812
I will compensate you to the tune of
10% of the recovered sum.

776
00:47:35.896 --> 00:47:37.898
- A hundred...
- Thousand. Yes.

777
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:40.734
Bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

778
00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:45.072
- Yeah, but what about my...
- Your rug, yes.

779
00:47:45.155 --> 00:47:47.741
Well, with that money
you can buy any number of rugs

780
00:47:47.824 --> 00:47:50.452
that don't have sentimental
value for me.

781
00:47:50.536 --> 00:47:53.038
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

782
00:47:53.121 --> 00:47:55.582
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even...

783
00:47:55.666 --> 00:47:58.266
Here's the name and number of a doctor
who will look at it for you.

784
00:47:58.293 --> 00:47:59.878
You will receive no bill.

785
00:47:59.962 --> 00:48:01.547
He's a good man
and thorough.

786
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.215
That's thoughtful but...

787
00:48:03.298 --> 00:48:06.802
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man and thorough.

788
00:48:08.428 --> 00:48:10.597
Oh, well, all right.

789
00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.267
So he says,
my wife's a pain in the ass.

790
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.769
She's always busting
my frigging agates.

791
00:48:15.852 --> 00:48:19.064
My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.

792
00:48:19.147 --> 00:48:23.026
I got a rash so bad on my ass
I can't even sit down.

793
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.237
But you know me,
I can't complain.

794
00:48:25.404 --> 00:48:27.155
Oh, fucking A, man.

795
00:48:27.239 --> 00:48:29.992
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

796
00:48:31.034 --> 00:48:33.579
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

797
00:48:33.662 --> 00:48:36.790
earlier today I was really
feeling shitty, man.

798
00:48:36.873 --> 00:48:38.792
Really down in the dumps.

799
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:40.252
Lost a little money...

800
00:48:40.335 --> 00:48:43.755
Hey, you know what? Forget about it, huh?
Forget about it.

801
00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:45.090
Yeah, fuck it, man.

802
00:48:45.173 --> 00:48:48.010
You can't be worried about that shit.
Life goes on, man.

803
00:48:48.093 --> 00:48:50.804
Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

804
00:48:53.515 --> 00:48:55.809
Hey, yo. Come here.

805
00:48:55.892 --> 00:48:58.395
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

806
00:49:00.272 --> 00:49:02.482
Yeah.
He followed us here.

807
00:49:02.566 --> 00:49:05.485
When did he start...
What the fuck?

808
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:07.696
Get in the limo, you son of a bitch!
No arguments!

809
00:49:07.779 --> 00:49:10.657
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

810
00:49:12.326 --> 00:49:14.786
Start talking, and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

811
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.764
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

812
00:49:16.788 --> 00:49:19.333
Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?

813
00:49:20.876 --> 00:49:23.587
Well, we... I don't...

814
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.964
They did not receive the money,
you nitwit!

815
00:49:26.048 --> 00:49:27.633
They did not receive the money!

816
00:49:27.716 --> 00:49:30.010
Her life was
in your hands!

817
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:31.637
This is our concern, Dude.

818
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.764
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

819
00:49:33.847 --> 00:49:35.766
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.

820
00:49:35.849 --> 00:49:39.645
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!

821
00:49:39.728 --> 00:49:43.982
Man, come on. Who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

822
00:49:44.066 --> 00:49:45.817
We dropped off the damn money.

823
00:49:45.901 --> 00:49:47.194
We?

824
00:49:48.487 --> 00:49:51.490
I, the royal we.

825
00:49:51.573 --> 00:49:52.908
You know. The editorial...

826
00:49:52.991 --> 00:49:55.035
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

827
00:49:55.118 --> 00:49:58.872
Look, man, I've got certain information.
All right?

828
00:49:58.955 --> 00:50:01.458
Certain things have
come to light and...

829
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:04.169
You know, has it ever
occurred to you

830
00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:09.675
that instead of, you know,
running around, blaming me...

831
00:50:09.758 --> 00:50:11.968
You know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

832
00:50:12.052 --> 00:50:17.891
you know, this could be
a lot more complex...

833
00:50:17.974 --> 00:50:22.938
I mean, it's not just... It might not be
just such a simple... You know?

834
00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:26.525
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

835
00:50:26.608 --> 00:50:28.985
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

836
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:31.029
I've got information, man.

837
00:50:31.113 --> 00:50:32.864
New shit has come to light.

838
00:50:32.948 --> 00:50:34.908
And, shit, man,

839
00:50:36.868 --> 00:50:38.787
she kidnapped herself.

840
00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:44.543
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

841
00:50:44.626 --> 00:50:48.547
A young trophy wife,
in the parlance of our times, you know.

842
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:53.802
She owes money all over town,
including to known pornographers.

843
00:50:55.721 --> 00:50:57.973
And that's cool.
That's cool.

844
00:50:58.849 --> 00:51:02.686
I'm saying
she needs money, man.

845
00:51:02.769 --> 00:51:06.440
And, you know, of course they're gonna
say they didn't get it

846
00:51:07.733 --> 00:51:10.569
because she wants more, man.

847
00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:13.071
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

848
00:51:15.407 --> 00:51:18.493
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

849
00:51:18.577 --> 00:51:19.661
Sir?

850
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:25.208
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.

851
00:51:25.292 --> 00:51:27.502
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

852
00:51:27.586 --> 00:51:29.045
Well, okay, you know?

853
00:51:29.129 --> 00:51:33.633
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so, you know...

854
00:51:33.717 --> 00:51:37.095
But, hey, that's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

855
00:51:39.514 --> 00:51:40.640
Speaking of which,

856
00:51:40.724 --> 00:51:45.061
do you think that you could
give me my $20,000 in cash?

857
00:51:45.145 --> 00:51:48.106
My concern is, and I've gotta
check it with my accountant,

858
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:50.942
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

859
00:51:51.026 --> 00:51:53.612
Brandt, give him
the envelope.

860
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:58.283
Oh, well, if you've already got
the check made out, that's cool.

861
00:51:58.366 --> 00:52:00.368
We received this
this morning.

862
00:52:02.913 --> 00:52:06.291
Since you have
failed to achieve,

863
00:52:06.374 --> 00:52:09.878
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

864
00:52:09.961 --> 00:52:13.131
since you have
stolen my money,

865
00:52:13.215 --> 00:52:16.927
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

866
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:20.972
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

867
00:52:21.056 --> 00:52:23.266
to do whatever is necessary

868
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:27.479
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

869
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:32.818
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

870
00:52:32.901 --> 00:52:36.154
any further harm
visited upon Bunny

871
00:52:36.238 --> 00:52:39.866
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

872
00:52:42.244 --> 00:52:43.703
By God, sir,

873
00:52:44.246 --> 00:52:47.249
I will not abide another toe.

874
00:52:53.338 --> 00:52:55.465
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

875
00:52:57.217 --> 00:53:00.220
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?

876
00:53:00.345 --> 00:53:03.849
- I do know that nothing about it indicates...
- The nail polish, Walter.

877
00:53:03.932 --> 00:53:05.225
Fine, Dude.

878
00:53:05.308 --> 00:53:09.187
As if it's impossible to get some nail
polish, apply it to someone else's toe...

879
00:53:09.271 --> 00:53:10.623
- Someone else...
- Pinking shears.

880
00:53:10.647 --> 00:53:12.047
Where the fuck are
they gonna get...

881
00:53:12.107 --> 00:53:14.860
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

882
00:53:14.943 --> 00:53:16.820
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

883
00:53:16.945 --> 00:53:19.257
- You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
- Yeah, but, Walter...

884
00:53:19.281 --> 00:53:22.701
Hell, I could get you a toe by 3:00
this afternoon with nail polish.

885
00:53:22.784 --> 00:53:24.703
- These fucking amateurs.
- Walter...

886
00:53:24.786 --> 00:53:27.622
They send us a toe, we're supposed to
shit ourselves with fear.

887
00:53:27.706 --> 00:53:29.249
- Jesus Christ!
- Walter...

888
00:53:29.374 --> 00:53:31.459
- The point is...
- They're gonna kill her, Walter,

889
00:53:31.543 --> 00:53:33.211
and then they're
gonna kill me.

890
00:53:33.295 --> 00:53:35.755
Dude, that's...

891
00:53:37.048 --> 00:53:39.217
That's just the
stress talking, man.

892
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:44.347
Now, so far we have what appears to me
to be a series of victimless crimes.

893
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:46.975
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!

894
00:53:47.058 --> 00:53:50.186
Excuse me, sir. Could you please
keep your voices down?

895
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:52.063
This is a family restaurant.

896
00:53:52.147 --> 00:53:54.566
Oh, please! Dear,
for your information,

897
00:53:54.649 --> 00:53:57.444
the Supreme Court has roundly rejected
prior restraint.

898
00:53:57.527 --> 00:53:59.905
Come on. Walter, this is not
a First Amendment thing, man.

899
00:53:59.988 --> 00:54:03.158
Sir, if you don't calm down,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

900
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:06.328
Lady, I got buddies
who died face down in the muck

901
00:54:06.411 --> 00:54:09.080
so that you and I can enjoy
this family restaurant!

902
00:54:09.205 --> 00:54:12.542
- All right, I'm out of here.
- Hey, Dude, don't go away, man.

903
00:54:12.626 --> 00:54:16.588
Come on. This affects all of us, man!
It's our basic freedoms!

904
00:54:21.343 --> 00:54:22.802
I'm staying.

905
00:54:25.013 --> 00:54:27.015
I'm finishing my coffee.

906
00:54:31.853 --> 00:54:33.647
Enjoying my coffee.

907
00:54:49.871 --> 00:54:52.040
The Dude is not in.

908
00:54:52.123 --> 00:54:54.960
Leave a message after the beep.
It takes a minute.

909
00:54:56.169 --> 00:54:59.881
Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer
Rolvaag of the LAPD.

910
00:54:59.965 --> 00:55:01.466
We've recovered
your automobile.

911
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:04.844
It can be claimed at the North Hollywood
Auto Circus there on Victory.

912
00:55:04.928 --> 00:55:06.054
Their hours there are...

913
00:55:06.137 --> 00:55:07.681
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

914
00:55:18.149 --> 00:55:21.528
Hey! This is a private
residence, man.

915
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:31.746
Oh, nice marmot.

916
00:55:41.506 --> 00:55:45.593
Where is the money, Lebowski?
We wants the money, Lebowski!

917
00:55:51.599 --> 00:55:54.811
You think we are kidding or
making with the funny stuff?

918
00:55:54.894 --> 00:55:57.188
We could do things
you haven't dreamed of, Lebowski.

919
00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:01.234
- Ja, we believes in nothing.
- We believes in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing!

920
00:56:01.317 --> 00:56:04.654
And tomorrow we come back
and we cut off your johnson.

921
00:56:04.738 --> 00:56:07.991
- Excuse me?
- I said, we cut off your johnson!

922
00:56:08.074 --> 00:56:10.493
Just think about that,
Lebowski.

923
00:56:10.577 --> 00:56:12.495
Your wiggly penis, Lebowski.

924
00:56:12.579 --> 00:56:14.914
Ja. Maybe we stomp on it
and squish it.

925
00:56:23.882 --> 00:56:28.303
It was discovered last night
Van Nuys lodged against an abutment.

926
00:56:28.386 --> 00:56:30.180
Oh, man. Lodged where?

927
00:56:30.263 --> 00:56:32.557
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

928
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.060
- Oh, man!
- Must've been a joyride situation.

929
00:56:35.143 --> 00:56:37.687
They abandoned the vehicle
once they hit the retaining wall.

930
00:56:37.771 --> 00:56:41.107
Oh, my fucking briefcase, man!
It's not here! Shit!

931
00:56:41.191 --> 00:56:42.901
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

932
00:56:42.984 --> 00:56:44.986
You gotta get in
on the other side.

933
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:49.199
The side view was found
on the road by the car.

934
00:56:50.784 --> 00:56:54.704
You're lucky they left the tape deck
though, and the Creedence.

935
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.707
Oh, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

936
00:56:57.791 --> 00:57:00.835
Yeah. It's probably
a vagrant slept in the car.

937
00:57:00.919 --> 00:57:03.671
Or maybe just used it
as a toilet and moved on.

938
00:57:03.755 --> 00:57:05.006
Hey, man,

939
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:07.967
are you gonna find these guys?

940
00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:12.597
Or, you know, I mean...
You got any promising leads or...

941
00:57:12.889 --> 00:57:14.432
Leads?

942
00:57:14.516 --> 00:57:16.101
Yeah. Sure.

943
00:57:16.184 --> 00:57:19.437
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

944
00:57:19.521 --> 00:57:23.358
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

945
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:25.068
They got us working in shifts!

946
00:57:30.532 --> 00:57:31.699
Leads!

947
00:57:32.534 --> 00:57:34.953
My only hope is that
the big Lebowski kills me

948
00:57:35.036 --> 00:57:36.746
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

949
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:37.956
Leads!

950
00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:39.707
Now, that is just
ridiculous, Dude.

951
00:57:39.791 --> 00:57:41.501
No one's going to
cut your dick off.

952
00:57:41.626 --> 00:57:44.129
- Thank you, Walter.
- Not if I have anything to say about it.

953
00:57:44.212 --> 00:57:45.255
Thank you, Walter.

954
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.382
- That makes me feel very secure.
- Dude?

955
00:57:47.507 --> 00:57:50.426
- That makes me feel very warm inside, man.
- Dude?

956
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:53.263
This whole fucking thing.

957
00:57:53.346 --> 00:57:56.558
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.

958
00:57:56.683 --> 00:57:59.936
- But no, man, I got a, you know...
- Yeah. Fucking Germans.

959
00:58:00.019 --> 00:58:01.187
Nothing changes.

960
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:05.817
- Fucking Nazis.
- They were Nazis, Dude?

961
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.486
Oh, come on, Donny.
They were threatening castration!

962
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:10.405
Are we gonna split hairs here?

963
00:58:10.488 --> 00:58:11.823
- No.
- Am I wrong?

964
00:58:11.906 --> 00:58:15.201
- Well, he didn't...
- Man, they were nihilists, man.

965
00:58:15.285 --> 00:58:17.829
They kept saying they
believed in nothing.

966
00:58:17.912 --> 00:58:19.247
Nihilists.

967
00:58:20.957 --> 00:58:22.250
Fuck me.

968
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.130
I mean, say what you want about
the tenets of national socialism, Dude.

969
00:58:27.213 --> 00:58:29.507
- At least it's an ethos.
- Yeah.

970
00:58:29.591 --> 00:58:32.302
And, also, let's not forget...
Let's not forget, Dude,

971
00:58:32.385 --> 00:58:35.346
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent,

972
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:38.975
for, you know,
domestic...

973
00:58:39.058 --> 00:58:40.810
Within the city...

974
00:58:41.603 --> 00:58:44.689
- That ain't legal, either.
- What are you, a fucking park ranger now?

975
00:58:44.772 --> 00:58:46.357
No! I'm just trying to...

976
00:58:46.441 --> 00:58:49.152
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

977
00:58:49.277 --> 00:58:52.488
- We are sympathizing here, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.

978
00:58:52.572 --> 00:58:56.492
I don't need your fucking sympathy, man.
I need my fucking johnson.

979
00:58:57.452 --> 00:59:00.663
- What do you need that for, Dude?
- You have got to buck up, man!

980
00:59:00.747 --> 00:59:03.541
You cannot drag this negative energy
into the tournament.

981
00:59:03.625 --> 00:59:06.294
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

982
00:59:09.005 --> 00:59:11.007
Fuck the tournament?

983
00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:14.093
Okay, Dude. I can see
you don't want to be cheered up here.

984
00:59:14.177 --> 00:59:16.638
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

985
00:59:21.643 --> 00:59:24.312
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.

986
00:59:26.814 --> 00:59:30.151
- Friends like these, huh, Gary?
- That's right, Dude.

987
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:58.388
- You got a good sarsaparilla?
- Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

988
00:59:58.471 --> 01:00:00.431
Yeah. That's a good one.

989
01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:05.812
How're you doing there, Dude?

990
01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:07.981
Not too good, man.

991
01:00:08.564 --> 01:00:10.984
- One of those days, huh?
- Yeah.

992
01:00:12.193 --> 01:00:16.948
Well, a wiser fellow
than myself once said...

993
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.825
Sometimes you eat
the bear and...

994
01:00:20.368 --> 01:00:22.453
Much obliged.

995
01:00:22.537 --> 01:00:26.374
Sometimes the bear,
well, he eats you.

996
01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:30.795
That some kind of
Eastern thing?

997
01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:32.338
Far from it.

998
01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:41.055
I like your style, Dude.

999
01:00:42.307 --> 01:00:46.311
Oh, well, I dig
your style too, man.

1000
01:00:46.394 --> 01:00:48.688
Got a whole cowboy thing going.

1001
01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:54.527
Thank you.

1002
01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:56.529
There's just one thing, Dude.

1003
01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:58.364
What's that?

1004
01:00:58.448 --> 01:01:01.075
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

1005
01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:06.789
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1006
01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:10.543
Okay, Dude. Have it your way.

1007
01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:15.173
Take her easy, Dude.

1008
01:01:15.256 --> 01:01:16.924
Yeah. Thanks, man.

1009
01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.640
Call for you, Dude.

1010
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:32.065
- Hello?
- Jeffrey, you have not gone to the doctor.

1011
01:01:32.148 --> 01:01:35.234
Oh, yeah, no.
No, I haven't yet.

1012
01:01:35.318 --> 01:01:37.820
I'd like to see you
immediately.

1013
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:55.755
- So, you're Lebowski.
- Yeah.

1014
01:01:58.633 --> 01:02:00.760
Maude has told me
all about you.

1015
01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:03.304
She'll be back in a minute.
Sit down.

1016
01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:06.724
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, sure. White Russian.

1017
01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:09.477
The bar's over there.

1018
01:02:14.315 --> 01:02:18.403
- So, what do you do, Lebowski?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

1019
01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:23.741
- Just a friend of Maudie's.
- Yeah? The friend with the cleft asshole?

1020
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:29.455
- What do you do?
- Oh, nothing much.

1021
01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:32.583
- Hello, Jeffrey.
- Hello.

1022
01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:35.545
Yeah. How are you?
Listen, Maude.

1023
01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:37.839
I got to

1024
01:02:40.174 --> 01:02:42.468
tender my resignation
or whatever

1025
01:02:42.552 --> 01:02:47.557
because looks like your mother really
was kidnapped after all.

1026
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.684
She most certainly was not.

1027
01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:54.814
Hey, man, why don't you
fucking listen occasionally?

1028
01:02:54.897 --> 01:02:57.442
You might learn something.
Now, I got...

1029
01:02:57.608 --> 01:03:00.361
Please don't call her
my mother.

1030
01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:03.281
She's most definitely the perpetrator
and not the victim.

1031
01:03:03.364 --> 01:03:06.200
I'm telling you, I've got
pretty definitive evidence.

1032
01:03:06.284 --> 01:03:09.120
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.

1033
01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:12.540
Uli Kunkel? Her co-star
in the beaver picture?

1034
01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:17.295
You mean vagina?
I mean, you know the guy?

1035
01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:20.214
I might have introduced them,
for all I know.

1036
01:03:20.298 --> 01:03:22.467
Do you remember Uli?

1037
01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:25.303
He's a musician.
Used to have a group, Autobahn.

1038
01:03:25.386 --> 01:03:29.932
Look in my LP's. They released
one album in the late '70s.

1039
01:03:30.016 --> 01:03:32.935
Their music is
sort of a techno pop.

1040
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.481
- So he's pretending to be the abductor?
- Well, yeah.

1041
01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:39.942
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap
someone you're acquainted with.

1042
01:03:40.026 --> 01:03:44.530
The whole idea is that the hostage
can't identify you after you've let them go.

1043
01:03:44.614 --> 01:03:46.324
Well, I know that.

1044
01:03:50.495 --> 01:03:53.164
What the fuck is with this guy?
Who is he?

1045
01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:56.751
Knox Harrington,
the video artist.

1046
01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.753
So, Uli has the money.

1047
01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:03.508
Well, no, not exactly.

1048
01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:06.135
This is a very complicated
case, Maude.

1049
01:04:06.302 --> 01:04:08.363
You know, a lot of ins,
a lot of outs,

1050
01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:09.514
a lot of what-have-yous

1051
01:04:09.597 --> 01:04:12.183
and a lot of strands
to keep in my head, man.

1052
01:04:12.266 --> 01:04:14.727
You know, a lot of strands
in the old Duder's head.

1053
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.020
Hello?

1054
01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.980
If Uli doesn't have it,
then who does?

1055
01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:19.982
It's Sandra
about the Biennale.

1056
01:04:20.066 --> 01:04:23.569
Look. I have to take this.
Do you still have that doctor's number?

1057
01:04:23.653 --> 01:04:27.198
- No, really, it's not even bruised anymore.
- Oh, please, Jeffrey.

1058
01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:30.368
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed aftereffects.

1059
01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:34.539
Aftereffects?

1060
01:05:03.985 --> 01:05:07.280
Could you slide your shorts down,
Mr. Lebowski, please?

1061
01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:10.741
No, no, man.
She hit me right here.

1062
01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:14.495
I understand. Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1063
01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:46.193
Keeping mighty cool.

1064
01:07:47.148 --> 01:07:50.609
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford,
near the In-N-Out Burger.

1065
01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:52.862
No, the In-N-Out Burger's
on Camrose.

1066
01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:55.364
- Near the In-N-Out Burger.
- Those are good burgers, Walter.

1067
01:07:55.448 --> 01:07:58.325
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
The kid is in the ninth grade, Dude.

1068
01:07:58.409 --> 01:08:01.036
And his father is...
Are you ready for this?

1069
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.457
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

1070
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.125
Who the fuck is that?

1071
01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.253
- Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
- Who the...

1072
01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:11.714
Have you ever heard of a little show
called Branded, Dude?

1073
01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:12.840
Yes, yes, I...

1074
01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.925
All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek.

1075
01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:17.261
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

1076
01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:21.390
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1077
01:08:21.474 --> 01:08:23.184
The bulk of the series.

1078
01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:26.937
- Not exactly a lightweight.
- No.

1079
01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:29.356
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1080
01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:33.569
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you.

1081
01:08:33.652 --> 01:08:35.321
We'll brace the kid.
Should be a pushover.

1082
01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:36.673
We'll be near
the In-N-Out Burger.

1083
01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:37.823
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

1084
01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:43.329
We'll go out there, we'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

1085
01:08:43.412 --> 01:08:45.539
We'll get that fucking
million dollars back,

1086
01:08:45.623 --> 01:08:47.750
if he hasn't
spent it already.

1087
01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:49.877
A million fucking clams.

1088
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.631
- And, yes, we'll be near the...
- In-N-Out.

1089
01:08:54.048 --> 01:08:57.468
Some burgers, some beers.
A few laughs.

1090
01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:02.473
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1091
01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:17.947
Oh, fuck me, man.

1092
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:20.825
That kid's already spent
all the money, man.

1093
01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:23.160
New Vette? Hardly, Dude.

1094
01:09:23.244 --> 01:09:28.582
I'd say he still has $960,000,
$970,000 left, depending on the options.

1095
01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:30.292
Wait in the car, Donny.

1096
01:09:34.463 --> 01:09:36.465
- Yes?
- Pilar?

1097
01:09:37.675 --> 01:09:41.804
My name is Walter Sobchak.
This is my associate, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1098
01:09:43.222 --> 01:09:45.516
We came to talk
about little Larry.

1099
01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:47.685
- May we come in?
- Yes, yes.

1100
01:09:47.768 --> 01:09:49.103
Thank you.

1101
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.067
That's him, Dude.

1102
01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:05.077
And a good day
to you, sir!

1103
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.162
Sit down, please.

1104
01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:15.379
Larry, sweetie,
the man is here!

1105
01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:18.299
Is he...
Does he still write?

1106
01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:21.510
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

1107
01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:26.682
Sir, I just want to say

1108
01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:30.144
that we're both,
on a personal level,

1109
01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:33.606
really enormous fans.

1110
01:10:33.689 --> 01:10:36.859
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

1111
01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:39.069
was truly a source
of inspiration.

1112
01:10:39.153 --> 01:10:41.947
Sweetie, sit down.
This man is the police.

1113
01:10:42.031 --> 01:10:45.618
Oh, no, ma'am. We didn't want to give
the impression that we were police, exactly.

1114
01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:48.454
We're hoping it won't be necessary
to call the police.

1115
01:10:48.537 --> 01:10:50.998
But that's up to
little Larry here.

1116
01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.708
Isn't it, Larry?

1117
01:11:03.594 --> 01:11:05.721
Is this your homework, Larry?

1118
01:11:07.181 --> 01:11:09.391
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- Look, man, it...

1119
01:11:09.475 --> 01:11:12.853
Dude. Please?
Is this your homework, Larry?

1120
01:11:12.937 --> 01:11:14.313
Just ask him about
the car, man.

1121
01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:16.732
Is this yours, Larry?
Is this your homework, Larry?

1122
01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.025
Is that your car out front?

1123
01:11:18.067 --> 01:11:21.028
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- We know it's his fucking homework!

1124
01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:23.364
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

1125
01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:26.450
Look, Larry, have you
ever heard of Vietnam?

1126
01:11:26.575 --> 01:11:28.929
- For Christ's sake, Walter.
- You are entering a world of pain, son.

1127
01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:31.622
We know that this is your homework.
We know that you stole the car.

1128
01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:34.249
- And the fucking money.
- And the fucking money!

1129
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:36.001
And we know that
this is your homework!

1130
01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:37.354
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

1131
01:11:37.378 --> 01:11:39.338
You're killing
your father, Larry.

1132
01:11:42.508 --> 01:11:44.593
All right.
This is pointless.

1133
01:11:45.886 --> 01:11:48.555
Okay, time for Plan B.

1134
01:11:50.808 --> 01:11:53.769
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1135
01:11:55.062 --> 01:11:58.440
Son, this is what happens
when you fuck a stranger in the ass!

1136
01:12:00.109 --> 01:12:02.069
A little language
problem here.

1137
01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:04.530
Little prick's
stonewalling me.

1138
01:12:05.406 --> 01:12:06.949
Walter.

1139
01:12:07.658 --> 01:12:09.660
What are you doing, man?

1140
01:12:12.287 --> 01:12:14.081
What are you doing?

1141
01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:17.084
Here you go, Larry.

1142
01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.169
You see what happens?

1143
01:12:19.253 --> 01:12:21.296
You see what happens, Larry?

1144
01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:23.882
- You see what happens?
- Oh, great.

1145
01:12:23.966 --> 01:12:27.553
This is what happens when you fuck
a stranger in the ass, Larry.

1146
01:12:30.597 --> 01:12:32.224
This is what happens, Larry.

1147
01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:34.143
You see what happens, Larry?

1148
01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:36.687
You see what happens when you fuck
a stranger in the ass?

1149
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:38.981
This is what happens!

1150
01:12:39.148 --> 01:12:41.233
You see what happens, Larry?

1151
01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:43.694
You see what happens, Larry?

1152
01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:47.489
Do you see what happens, Larry,
when you fuck a stranger in the ass?

1153
01:12:48.741 --> 01:12:50.284
This is what happens, Larry!

1154
01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:52.036
This is what happens, Larry!

1155
01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:54.872
- My car! My baby!
- This is what happens, Larry!

1156
01:12:54.955 --> 01:12:56.915
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

1157
01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:59.668
What the fuck are you
doing, man? Stop it!

1158
01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:02.254
- Hey, man.
- I just bought that fucking car last week!

1159
01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:05.382
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm sorry!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1160
01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:08.635
- I just bought the fucking car last week!
- Come on, man.

1161
01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:10.554
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1162
01:13:10.637 --> 01:13:12.681
No, no. Hey, hey,
that's not his! Hey!

1163
01:13:12.765 --> 01:13:15.225
- God damn it!
- Oh, no!

1164
01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:17.102
- Fuck you!
- Man. No.

1165
01:13:17.186 --> 01:13:19.688
You like that? Fuck you!

1166
01:13:19.772 --> 01:13:23.233
- I'll kill your fucking car!
- No. No, no. No.

1167
01:13:23.317 --> 01:13:25.235
I'll kill your fucking car!

1168
01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:48.175
I accept your apology.

1169
01:13:49.343 --> 01:13:52.846
No, I just want to handle it
by myself from now on.

1170
01:13:54.056 --> 01:13:56.100
No. No. No!

1171
01:13:56.183 --> 01:13:58.018
That has nothing
to do with it.

1172
01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:02.773
Yes, the car made it home.
You're calling me at home.

1173
01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:09.154
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack!

1174
01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:13.367
Well, that's your perception.

1175
01:14:15.077 --> 01:14:17.746
You know, Walter,
you're right.

1176
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.790
There is an unspoken
message here.

1177
01:14:19.873 --> 01:14:22.292
It's, fuck you!
Leave me the fuck alone!

1178
01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:27.047
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1179
01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:46.483
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

1180
01:14:46.567 --> 01:14:48.318
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

1181
01:14:48.402 --> 01:14:51.280
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.

1182
01:14:51.363 --> 01:14:54.199
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

1183
01:14:54.283 --> 01:14:56.160
You're not dealing
with morons here.

1184
01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:47.211
Hello, Dude.
Thanks for coming.

1185
01:15:47.294 --> 01:15:48.962
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1186
01:15:51.882 --> 01:15:54.593
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1187
01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:56.678
Completely unspoiled.

1188
01:15:56.762 --> 01:15:59.973
- What's your drink, Dude?
- A White Russian. Thanks.

1189
01:16:00.849 --> 01:16:02.142
White Russian.

1190
01:16:02.768 --> 01:16:06.730
- How's the smut business, Jackie?
- I wouldn't know, Dude.

1191
01:16:06.813 --> 01:16:12.236
I deal in publishing,
entertainment, political advocacy.

1192
01:16:12.319 --> 01:16:15.572
- Which one's Logjammin'?
- Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1193
01:16:15.656 --> 01:16:18.492
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1194
01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:20.202
It's video, Dude.

1195
01:16:21.036 --> 01:16:22.871
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1196
01:16:22.955 --> 01:16:26.500
we can't afford to invest
in little extras like story,

1197
01:16:27.334 --> 01:16:30.254
production value, feelings.

1198
01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:37.219
You know, people forget that the brain
is the biggest erogenous zone.

1199
01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:39.429
On you maybe.

1200
01:16:39.513 --> 01:16:41.473
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

1201
01:16:41.515 --> 01:16:44.434
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

1202
01:16:44.518 --> 01:16:47.229
in interactive
erotic software.

1203
01:16:47.312 --> 01:16:51.400
Wave of the future, Dude.
100% electronic.

1204
01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:55.362
Well, I still jerk off
manually.

1205
01:16:57.656 --> 01:17:02.035
Of course you do. I can see
you're anxious for me to get to the point.

1206
01:17:02.119 --> 01:17:04.830
Well, here it is, Dude.

1207
01:17:04.913 --> 01:17:06.498
Where's Bunny?

1208
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.126
- Well, I thought you might know that, man.
- Why would I?

1209
01:17:09.209 --> 01:17:13.463
She only ran off to get away
from that rather sizable debt to me.

1210
01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:15.966
No, she didn't run off.
She's been...

1211
01:17:16.049 --> 01:17:18.135
I heard that kidnapping story,
so save it.

1212
01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:20.220
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude.

1213
01:17:21.847 --> 01:17:24.975
And I don't care what you're trying
to get from the husband.

1214
01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.560
That's your business.

1215
01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:30.480
All I'm saying is I want mine.

1216
01:17:30.564 --> 01:17:31.815
Yeah, right, man.

1217
01:17:31.898 --> 01:17:35.777
I mean, there are a lot of
facets to this,

1218
01:17:35.902 --> 01:17:37.782
a lot of interested parties.

1219
01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:39.531
Excuse me.

1220
01:17:45.245 --> 01:17:46.330
Yeah?

1221
01:17:47.289 --> 01:17:48.457
Oh, yeah?

1222
01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:49.958
Where is that?

1223
01:17:53.587 --> 01:17:55.714
All right. Yeah.

1224
01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:00.052
Excuse me.

1225
01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:39.216
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.

1226
01:18:39.299 --> 01:18:43.637
So, if I can find your money,

1227
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.307
what's in it for the Dude?

1228
01:18:47.391 --> 01:18:50.560
Well, of course, there's that to discuss.
You want a refill?

1229
01:18:50.644 --> 01:18:54.106
- Yeah, does the pope shit in the woods?
- 10% finder's fee.

1230
01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:57.651
- That all right?
- Okay. Done, Jackie.

1231
01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:00.904
I dig the way
you do business, man.

1232
01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:04.616
Your money is being held by a kid
named Larry Sellers.

1233
01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:07.452
He lives in North Hollywood
on Radford,

1234
01:19:08.662 --> 01:19:11.164
by the In-N-Out Burger.

1235
01:19:11.248 --> 01:19:12.290
Fucking brat.

1236
01:19:12.374 --> 01:19:16.586
But I'm sure your goons can get it
off him. I mean, he's 15.

1237
01:19:18.839 --> 01:19:20.799
Flunking social studies.

1238
01:19:24.177 --> 01:19:27.055
So, if you could just

1239
01:19:27.139 --> 01:19:31.435
write me a check for
my 10% of half a million,

1240
01:19:31.518 --> 01:19:34.604
5 grand,
I'll go out and mingle.

1241
01:19:39.067 --> 01:19:41.528
You mix a hell of
a Caucasian, Jackie.

1242
01:19:43.029 --> 01:19:45.115
Fifteen-year-old kid.

1243
01:19:45.866 --> 01:19:49.870
- Is this some sort of a joke?
- No. No joke.

1244
01:19:51.663 --> 01:19:54.791
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

1245
01:19:54.875 --> 01:19:56.042
Hi, fellas.

1246
01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.380
Kid just wanted a car.

1247
01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:07.053
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1248
01:20:07.554 --> 01:20:08.889
Not greedy.

1249
01:20:10.557 --> 01:20:11.933
It really

1250
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.270
tied the room together.

1251
01:20:18.231 --> 01:20:21.401
Darkness washed
over the Dude.

1252
01:20:21.485 --> 01:20:25.989
Darker than a black steer's tokus
on a moonless prairie night.

1253
01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:29.743
There was no bottom.

1254
01:24:10.714 --> 01:24:14.134
He was innocent.

1255
01:24:15.051 --> 01:24:18.680
Not a charge was true.

1256
01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:24.978
And they say
he ran away branded.

1257
01:24:38.366 --> 01:24:40.201
Is this your only ID?

1258
01:24:40.994 --> 01:24:42.912
I know my rights, man.

1259
01:24:45.039 --> 01:24:46.791
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

1260
01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:49.586
I want a fucking lawyer, man.

1261
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:53.840
I want Bill Kunstler, man,

1262
01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:57.051
or Ron Kuby.

1263
01:24:57.135 --> 01:25:00.305
Mr. Treehorn tells us
that he had to eject you

1264
01:25:00.388 --> 01:25:02.390
from his garden party,

1265
01:25:02.849 --> 01:25:04.768
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1266
01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:09.939
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1267
01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.568
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1268
01:25:13.651 --> 01:25:16.029
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1269
01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:18.823
Now, we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1270
01:25:18.907 --> 01:25:21.451
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1271
01:25:21.534 --> 01:25:23.870
So let me make
something plain.

1272
01:25:24.412 --> 01:25:28.500
I don't like you sucking around
bothering our citizens, Lebowski.

1273
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:31.461
I don't like your
jerk-off name.

1274
01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:32.796
I don't like your
jerk-off face.

1275
01:25:32.879 --> 01:25:34.506
I don't like your
jerk-off behavior.

1276
01:25:34.589 --> 01:25:37.550
And I don't like you,
jerk-off.

1277
01:25:41.221 --> 01:25:43.097
Do I make myself clear?

1278
01:25:46.226 --> 01:25:48.228
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1279
01:25:50.855 --> 01:25:52.440
Fucking fascist!

1280
01:25:54.067 --> 01:25:56.236
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski.

1281
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:59.197
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

1282
01:26:00.365 --> 01:26:04.869
Keep your ugly, fucking, gold-bricking
ass out of my beach community.

1283
01:26:17.674 --> 01:26:20.844
Jesus, man. Could you
change the channel?

1284
01:26:20.927 --> 01:26:22.655
Fuck you, man! If you don't like
my fucking music,

1285
01:26:22.679 --> 01:26:24.180
get your own fucking cab!

1286
01:26:24.264 --> 01:26:25.348
I had a really rough...

1287
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.243
I'll pull off to the side
and kick your ass out.

1288
01:26:27.267 --> 01:26:31.980
Man, come on. I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles, man.

1289
01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:42.323
- Out of my fucking cab! Out!
- Man!

1290
01:26:43.783 --> 01:26:45.952
Man! Man! Hey!

1291
01:26:57.130 --> 01:27:01.050
<i>There's a thousand pretty
women waiting out there</i>

1292
01:27:01.134 --> 01:27:04.888
<i>And they're all livin'
devil may care</i>

1293
01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:08.558
<i>And I'm just the devil
with love to spare</i>

1294
01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:12.103
<i>So viva Las Vegas</i>

1295
01:27:12.937 --> 01:27:16.482
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

1296
01:27:28.494 --> 01:27:31.122
Oh, Jesus!

1297
01:27:51.059 --> 01:27:52.310
Jeffrey.

1298
01:27:53.227 --> 01:27:55.104
- Maude?
- Love me.

1299
01:27:57.899 --> 01:27:59.859
That's my robe.

1300
01:28:01.152 --> 01:28:03.071
Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

1301
01:28:03.905 --> 01:28:06.157
Well, not much to tell.

1302
01:28:07.283 --> 01:28:12.914
I was one of the authors
of the Port Huron Statement.

1303
01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.918
The original
Port Huron Statement.

1304
01:28:17.377 --> 01:28:20.922
Not the compromised
second draft.

1305
01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.550
Then I...

1306
01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:28.262
You ever hear of
the Seattle Seven?

1307
01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:29.722
That was me.

1308
01:28:32.976 --> 01:28:35.228
And there were
six other guys.

1309
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:39.983
And then the music
business, briefly.

1310
01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:41.609
Yeah.

1311
01:28:41.693 --> 01:28:43.403
Roadie for Metallica.

1312
01:28:44.612 --> 01:28:46.114
Speed of Sound tour.

1313
01:28:48.324 --> 01:28:49.993
Bunch of assholes.

1314
01:28:51.285 --> 01:28:54.664
And then, you know,
little of this, little of that.

1315
01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.293
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1316
01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:02.505
What do you do
for recreation?

1317
01:29:03.297 --> 01:29:04.757
Well, the usual.

1318
01:29:04.841 --> 01:29:07.635
Bowl, drive around,

1319
01:29:09.095 --> 01:29:11.431
the occasional
acid flashback.

1320
01:29:17.645 --> 01:29:19.731
What happened
to your house?

1321
01:29:19.814 --> 01:29:22.358
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1322
01:29:22.442 --> 01:29:25.361
He thought I had
your father's money.

1323
01:29:25.445 --> 01:29:28.614
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1324
01:29:28.698 --> 01:29:30.825
- Cocktail?
- No, thanks.

1325
01:29:30.908 --> 01:29:33.995
It's not my father's money.
It's the foundation's.

1326
01:29:34.495 --> 01:29:37.790
Why did he think you have it?
Who does?

1327
01:29:37.874 --> 01:29:42.336
Oh, Larry Sellers, this high school kid.
Real fucking brat.

1328
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.965
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1329
01:29:46.049 --> 01:29:48.051
A lot of ins, a lot of outs.

1330
01:29:48.718 --> 01:29:53.264
You know, fortunately, I'm adhering
to a pretty strict, drug regimen

1331
01:29:53.347 --> 01:29:55.600
to keep my mind,
you know, limber,

1332
01:29:55.683 --> 01:29:59.228
and I'm very fucking close
to your father's money.

1333
01:29:59.312 --> 01:30:01.939
I keep telling you,
it's the foundation's money.

1334
01:30:02.023 --> 01:30:03.649
Father doesn't have any.

1335
01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:07.403
What are you talking about?
He's fucking loaded.

1336
01:30:07.487 --> 01:30:09.822
No, no. The wealth
is all Mother's.

1337
01:30:10.615 --> 01:30:12.075
No, he runs stuff.

1338
01:30:12.492 --> 01:30:14.702
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

1339
01:30:14.786 --> 01:30:17.705
- but he didn't do very well at it.
- Oh, he's, you know...

1340
01:30:17.789 --> 01:30:20.166
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

1341
01:30:20.249 --> 01:30:22.877
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1342
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.629
He has no money of his own.

1343
01:30:24.712 --> 01:30:26.422
I know how he likes
to present himself.

1344
01:30:26.506 --> 01:30:29.801
Father's weakness is vanity,
hence the slut.

1345
01:30:32.053 --> 01:30:33.679
Do you think he...

1346
01:30:35.181 --> 01:30:36.516
What is that, yoga?

1347
01:30:36.599 --> 01:30:38.976
It increases the chances
of conception.

1348
01:30:41.938 --> 01:30:44.440
- Increases...
- Well, yes.

1349
01:30:44.524 --> 01:30:47.485
What did you think this was all about?
Fun and games?

1350
01:30:47.568 --> 01:30:49.112
I want a child.

1351
01:30:49.695 --> 01:30:51.531
Okay, yeah, okay.

1352
01:30:51.614 --> 01:30:54.450
But let me... Let me explain
something about the Dude.

1353
01:30:54.534 --> 01:30:57.995
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

1354
01:30:58.079 --> 01:31:01.791
In fact, I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see socially

1355
01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:04.961
or who will have any interest
in raising the child himself.

1356
01:31:06.379 --> 01:31:09.882
- So, that doctor...
- Exactly.

1357
01:31:10.967 --> 01:31:13.845
Now, what happened
to your face?

1358
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:16.597
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?

1359
01:31:16.681 --> 01:31:21.978
No, it was the chief of police of Malibu,
a real reactionary.

1360
01:31:22.061 --> 01:31:23.813
So, your father...

1361
01:31:25.815 --> 01:31:28.734
- Oh, yeah, I get it. Yeah. Yeah.
- What?

1362
01:31:28.818 --> 01:31:33.239
Oh, man. My thinking about this case
has become very uptight.

1363
01:31:33.322 --> 01:31:34.824
Yeah.

1364
01:31:34.907 --> 01:31:36.242
Your father.

1365
01:31:37.243 --> 01:31:40.246
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

1366
01:31:42.248 --> 01:31:43.249
Jeffrey!

1367
01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:46.127
Walter, if you're there,
pick up the fucking phone, man.

1368
01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:48.212
Come on, Walter.

1369
01:31:48.296 --> 01:31:51.507
- Pick it up, man. This is an emergency.
- Dude? Dude?

1370
01:31:51.591 --> 01:31:55.553
Yeah. Listen, Walter. I'm at my place.
I need you to come pick me up.

1371
01:31:55.636 --> 01:31:58.014
- I can't drive, Dude. It's Erev shabbos.
- What?

1372
01:31:58.097 --> 01:31:59.515
- Erev shabbos.
- What?

1373
01:31:59.599 --> 01:32:02.768
- Erev shabbos. I can't drive.
- Man!

1374
01:32:02.852 --> 01:32:05.492
I'm not even supposed to pick up
the phone unless it's an emergency.

1375
01:32:05.563 --> 01:32:08.941
- This is a fucking emergency!
- I understand.

1376
01:32:09.025 --> 01:32:10.610
That's why I picked up
the phone.

1377
01:32:10.693 --> 01:32:13.988
Walter, you fuck.
We gotta go to Pasadena, man.

1378
01:32:14.071 --> 01:32:16.324
Come pick me up or I'm off
the fucking bowling team.

1379
01:32:31.964 --> 01:32:34.425
Get out of that
fucking car, man!

1380
01:32:35.718 --> 01:32:37.762
Get out of that fucking car!

1381
01:32:37.845 --> 01:32:40.139
Get the fuck
out of the car, man.

1382
01:32:42.141 --> 01:32:44.143
Get out of the fucking...

1383
01:32:44.727 --> 01:32:46.562
- Who the fuck are you, man?
- Easy, man!

1384
01:32:46.646 --> 01:32:48.022
Relax, man.

1385
01:32:49.106 --> 01:32:50.775
No physical harm intended.

1386
01:32:50.858 --> 01:32:53.569
Who the fuck are you?
Why you following me around?

1387
01:32:53.694 --> 01:32:56.864
- Come on, fuckhead!
- Relax, man. I'm a brother shamus.

1388
01:32:57.865 --> 01:32:59.408
Brother Shamus?

1389
01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.828
Like an Irish monk?

1390
01:33:02.912 --> 01:33:04.789
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1391
01:33:04.872 --> 01:33:08.834
My name is Da Fino.
I'm a private snoop, like you, man.

1392
01:33:10.127 --> 01:33:12.171
- What?
- A dick, man.

1393
01:33:12.255 --> 01:33:15.383
And let me tell you something,
I dig your work.

1394
01:33:15.466 --> 01:33:18.427
Playing one side against the other,
in bed with everybody.

1395
01:33:18.511 --> 01:33:20.888
- Fabulous stuff, man.
- I'm not...

1396
01:33:20.972 --> 01:33:23.891
Fuck it, man. Just stay away from
my fucking lady friend.

1397
01:33:23.975 --> 01:33:26.519
Hey, I'm not messing
with your special lady.

1398
01:33:26.602 --> 01:33:29.105
She's not my special lady.
She's my fucking lady friend.

1399
01:33:29.230 --> 01:33:31.983
- I'm just helping her conceive, man!
- Hey, man. I'm not...

1400
01:33:32.066 --> 01:33:34.527
Who are you working for?
Lebowski?

1401
01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:36.028
Jackie Treehorn?

1402
01:33:37.863 --> 01:33:39.365
The Kneutsons.

1403
01:33:40.741 --> 01:33:43.369
Who the fuck are
the Kneutsons?

1404
01:33:43.452 --> 01:33:47.039
The Kneutsons,
it's a wandering daughter job.

1405
01:33:48.416 --> 01:33:50.960
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1406
01:33:51.043 --> 01:33:53.838
Her real name is
Fawn Kneutson.

1407
01:33:53.921 --> 01:33:55.881
Her parents
want her back, see?

1408
01:33:57.049 --> 01:33:59.010
Jesus fucking Christ.

1409
01:33:59.093 --> 01:34:02.013
Crazy, huh?
Ran away about a year ago.

1410
01:34:02.096 --> 01:34:05.808
The Kneutsons told me I should show
her this when I found her.

1411
01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:09.437
It's the family farm.
It's outside Moorhead, Minnesota.

1412
01:34:09.562 --> 01:34:12.648
- They think it'll make her homesick.
- Oh, boy.

1413
01:34:12.732 --> 01:34:14.418
How are you gonna keep them
down on the farm

1414
01:34:14.442 --> 01:34:16.402
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

1415
01:34:17.028 --> 01:34:19.530
- She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
- Oh, man.

1416
01:34:19.613 --> 01:34:20.823
Or I don't know.
Maybe not.

1417
01:34:20.906 --> 01:34:22.491
But she's definitely
not around.

1418
01:34:22.575 --> 01:34:26.495
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources,

1419
01:34:26.912 --> 01:34:28.748
trade information.

1420
01:34:28.873 --> 01:34:30.666
Professional courtesy?

1421
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:32.394
Compeers.
You know what I mean?

1422
01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:34.962
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1423
01:34:35.046 --> 01:34:37.173
And stay away
from my special...

1424
01:34:37.256 --> 01:34:40.176
From my fucking
lady friend, man!

1425
01:34:42.762 --> 01:34:44.680
The lingonberry pancake.

1426
01:34:49.185 --> 01:34:51.312
Lingonberry pancakes.

1427
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.776
Three pigs in blanket.

1428
01:35:02.782 --> 01:35:04.658
She has lingonberry pancakes.

1429
01:35:13.417 --> 01:35:16.712
I mean, we totally fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his payoff.

1430
01:35:16.796 --> 01:35:19.006
We got the kidnappers
all pissed off.

1431
01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:21.342
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

1432
01:35:21.425 --> 01:35:23.552
but he didn't do
anything, huh?

1433
01:35:23.677 --> 01:35:25.888
- Well, sometimes it's a cathartic...
- No, no.

1434
01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:28.265
I'm saying that
if he knows I'm a fuckup,

1435
01:35:28.349 --> 01:35:30.726
why does he leave me
in charge of getting his wife back?

1436
01:35:30.810 --> 01:35:34.146
Because he doesn't
fucking want her back, man.

1437
01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:37.400
He's had enough. He no longer digs her.
It's all a show.

1438
01:35:37.483 --> 01:35:41.904
Okay, but then why doesn't he give a shit
about his million bucks?

1439
01:35:41.987 --> 01:35:44.657
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1440
01:35:44.824 --> 01:35:46.885
but he never asked
for it back.

1441
01:35:46.909 --> 01:35:49.995
The million bucks
was never in the briefcase.

1442
01:35:50.663 --> 01:35:53.707
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1443
01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:56.460
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1444
01:35:56.544 --> 01:35:59.088
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1445
01:35:59.171 --> 01:36:02.925
Okay, but how does all this
add up to an emergency?

1446
01:36:03.008 --> 01:36:07.221
I'm saying, I see what you're
getting at, Dude. He kept the money.

1447
01:36:07.304 --> 01:36:09.140
My point is...

1448
01:36:09.223 --> 01:36:12.435
Here we are, it's shabbos,
the Sabbath,

1449
01:36:12.518 --> 01:36:16.564
which I'm allowed to break
only if it's a matter of life or death.

1450
01:36:16.647 --> 01:36:19.984
Will you come off it, Walter?
You're not even fucking Jewish, man.

1451
01:36:20.067 --> 01:36:21.735
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1452
01:36:21.819 --> 01:36:23.219
Man, you're fucking
Polish Catholic!

1453
01:36:23.279 --> 01:36:24.905
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1454
01:36:24.989 --> 01:36:27.116
I converted when I married Cynthia.
Come on, Dude.

1455
01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:29.201
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know this.

1456
01:36:29.285 --> 01:36:31.537
And five fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

1457
01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:33.181
So what are you saying?
When you get divorced,

1458
01:36:33.205 --> 01:36:35.332
you turn in your library card?
You get a new license?

1459
01:36:35.416 --> 01:36:38.502
- You stop being Jewish?
- This is the driveway.

1460
01:36:38.586 --> 01:36:40.629
- Jewish as fucking Tevye.
- Man.

1461
01:36:40.713 --> 01:36:44.967
You know, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

1462
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:48.971
Man, taking care of her fucking dog,
going to her fucking synagogue.

1463
01:36:49.054 --> 01:36:50.890
You're living in
the fucking past.

1464
01:36:50.973 --> 01:36:54.310
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition,
from Moses to Sandy Koufax.

1465
01:36:54.393 --> 01:36:57.354
You're goddamn right
I'm living in the fucking past!

1466
01:36:57.438 --> 01:36:59.565
I've... Jesus.

1467
01:37:00.816 --> 01:37:02.735
What the hell happened?

1468
01:37:15.748 --> 01:37:17.750
Let's go. Fuck it.

1469
01:37:22.087 --> 01:37:23.506
Where was she, man?

1470
01:37:23.589 --> 01:37:25.591
Visiting friends of hers
in Palm Springs.

1471
01:37:25.674 --> 01:37:28.093
She just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

1472
01:37:28.177 --> 01:37:30.679
Well, I guess the fucking nihilists
knew where she was.

1473
01:37:30.763 --> 01:37:32.932
Jesus, Dude. She never
even kidnapped herself.

1474
01:37:33.057 --> 01:37:36.393
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am I? I'm a fucking veteran.

1475
01:37:36.477 --> 01:37:37.686
- Come on!
- That's who I am.

1476
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:40.314
You shouldn't go in there, Dude.
He's very angry.

1477
01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:44.026
So, man.

1478
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:47.905
So? She's back,
no thanks to you.

1479
01:37:47.988 --> 01:37:50.366
Where's the fucking money,
Lebowski?

1480
01:37:50.449 --> 01:37:53.786
A million bucks from fucking, needy,
little Urban Achievers!

1481
01:37:53.869 --> 01:37:55.371
You are scum, man!

1482
01:37:55.454 --> 01:37:57.706
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am I? Who am I?

1483
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:59.434
- Walter.
- I'm the guy that's gonna kick your phony,

1484
01:37:59.458 --> 01:38:00.852
- gold-bricking ass, that's who I am.
- Man.

1485
01:38:00.876 --> 01:38:02.711
We know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

1486
01:38:02.795 --> 01:38:04.838
We know you kept
the million bucks for yourself.

1487
01:38:04.922 --> 01:38:06.507
You have your story,
I have mine.

1488
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:09.885
I say I entrusted the money
to you and you stole it.

1489
01:38:09.969 --> 01:38:13.180
As if we would ever dream of taking
your bullshit money!

1490
01:38:13.264 --> 01:38:15.474
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

1491
01:38:15.558 --> 01:38:17.142
and you were
fucking glad, man.

1492
01:38:17.226 --> 01:38:19.538
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

1493
01:38:19.562 --> 01:38:22.856
All you needed was a sap to pin it on.
You just met me.

1494
01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.859
You... You human paraquat.

1495
01:38:25.943 --> 01:38:29.405
You figured, oh, here's a loser,
you know, a deadbeat.

1496
01:38:29.488 --> 01:38:32.074
Somebody this square community
won't give a shit about.

1497
01:38:32.157 --> 01:38:33.742
Well, aren't you?

1498
01:38:34.994 --> 01:38:38.747
- Well, yeah, but...
- Get out, both of you.

1499
01:38:38.831 --> 01:38:42.084
Look at that fucking phony, Dude,
pretending to be a fucking millionaire.

1500
01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:44.461
Out of this house now,
you bums!

1501
01:38:44.545 --> 01:38:46.130
Let me tell you
something else.

1502
01:38:46.213 --> 01:38:49.967
I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,
and this guy's a fake.

1503
01:38:50.676 --> 01:38:53.846
- A fucking gold-bricker.
- Stay away from me, mister!

1504
01:38:53.929 --> 01:38:55.598
This guy fucking walks.

1505
01:38:55.681 --> 01:38:58.017
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

1506
01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.268
You stay away from me!

1507
01:38:59.351 --> 01:39:01.770
Walter, for Christ's sake, man!
He's a cripple.

1508
01:39:01.854 --> 01:39:03.694
- I said! Get away from me!
- Come on. Come on.

1509
01:39:03.731 --> 01:39:07.192
Walter, put him down, man!

1510
01:39:07.276 --> 01:39:10.946
Yeah, I'll put him down, Dude.
Walk! Achtung, baby!

1511
01:39:28.213 --> 01:39:31.342
Come on, man. Help me
put him back in his chair.

1512
01:39:35.262 --> 01:39:37.324
At least they had the fucking
decency to tell us

1513
01:39:37.348 --> 01:39:39.725
that we were fighting
the communists.

1514
01:39:42.227 --> 01:39:45.648
Whereas this whole fucking thing,
this whole fucking thing

1515
01:39:45.731 --> 01:39:48.567
is nothing about nothing,
about oil,

1516
01:39:48.651 --> 01:39:50.986
which is what I personally
hear, Dude.

1517
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:53.364
Sure you'll see
some tank battles,

1518
01:39:53.447 --> 01:39:56.992
but fighting in desert is very different
from fighting in canopy jungle.

1519
01:39:58.077 --> 01:40:01.497
I mean, Nam was a foot soldier's war,
whereas this thing should...

1520
01:40:02.456 --> 01:40:04.708
You know, should be
a piece of cake.

1521
01:40:04.792 --> 01:40:08.212
I mean, I had an M16, Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1522
01:40:08.337 --> 01:40:11.715
- Me and Charlie, eyeball to eyeball.
- Yeah.

1523
01:40:11.799 --> 01:40:14.134
That's fucking combat.

1524
01:40:14.218 --> 01:40:17.096
The man in the black
pajamas, Dude.

1525
01:40:17.179 --> 01:40:19.056
Worthy fucking adversary.

1526
01:40:19.139 --> 01:40:22.559
- Who's in pajamas, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1527
01:40:22.643 --> 01:40:24.853
Whereas what we have here,

1528
01:40:24.937 --> 01:40:27.106
a bunch of fig eaters
wearing towels on their head,

1529
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:29.358
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1530
01:40:30.234 --> 01:40:32.462
- This is not a worthy fucking adversary.
- Hey!

1531
01:40:32.486 --> 01:40:34.530
What's this
day-of-rest shit?

1532
01:40:34.613 --> 01:40:36.198
What's this bullshit?

1533
01:40:36.281 --> 01:40:39.326
I don't fucking care!
It don't matter to Jesus.

1534
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:40.869
But you not fooling me, man.

1535
01:40:40.953 --> 01:40:43.664
You might fool the fucks
in the league office

1536
01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:46.041
but you don't fool Jesus.

1537
01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:48.919
It's Bush league
psych-out stuff.

1538
01:40:49.002 --> 01:40:50.421
Laughable, man!

1539
01:40:51.588 --> 01:40:54.675
I would've fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1540
01:40:55.426 --> 01:40:58.345
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1541
01:40:59.805 --> 01:41:02.266
You got a date
Wednesday, baby!

1542
01:41:07.146 --> 01:41:08.313
He's cracking.

1543
01:41:08.397 --> 01:41:10.107
The whole concept of age.

1544
01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:12.401
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this

1545
01:41:12.484 --> 01:41:15.320
but in the 14th century,
the Rambam...

1546
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:27.541
Well, they finally did it.

1547
01:41:27.624 --> 01:41:29.752
They killed
my fucking car.

1548
01:41:29.835 --> 01:41:33.422
We want the money,
Lebowski.

1549
01:41:33.505 --> 01:41:36.008
Ja. Otherwise,
we kill the girl.

1550
01:41:36.091 --> 01:41:39.595
Ja. It seems you have forgotten
our little deal, Lebowski.

1551
01:41:39.678 --> 01:41:42.431
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

1552
01:41:42.514 --> 01:41:44.767
We know you never did.

1553
01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:46.435
Are these the Nazis, Walter?

1554
01:41:46.518 --> 01:41:48.228
No, Donny.
These men are nihilists.

1555
01:41:48.312 --> 01:41:49.730
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

1556
01:41:51.398 --> 01:41:52.483
We don't care.

1557
01:41:52.566 --> 01:41:57.029
We still want the money,
Lebowski, or we fuck you up.

1558
01:41:57.112 --> 01:41:59.782
- Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.
- Cool it, Walter.

1559
01:41:59.865 --> 01:42:03.702
No. Without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1560
01:42:03.786 --> 01:42:07.122
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1561
01:42:07.206 --> 01:42:09.541
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

1562
01:42:09.625 --> 01:42:11.960
She thought we could
get $1 million.

1563
01:42:12.044 --> 01:42:14.546
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

1564
01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:18.258
Who's the fucking nihilists around here,
you bunch of fucking crybabies?

1565
01:42:18.342 --> 01:42:20.719
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal.

1566
01:42:20.803 --> 01:42:22.513
There never
was any money.

1567
01:42:22.596 --> 01:42:24.723
The big Lebowski gave me
an empty briefcase,

1568
01:42:24.807 --> 01:42:26.850
so take it up with him, man.

1569
01:42:26.934 --> 01:42:29.478
And I would like
my undies back.

1570
01:42:29.561 --> 01:42:30.830
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

1571
01:42:30.854 --> 01:42:33.315
No, Donny.
These men are cowards.

1572
01:42:33.398 --> 01:42:34.691
Okay!

1573
01:42:34.775 --> 01:42:38.320
So we takes the money you have
on you, and we calls it even.

1574
01:42:39.738 --> 01:42:41.782
- Fuck you.
- Hey, no. Come on, Walter.

1575
01:42:41.865 --> 01:42:43.867
Come on, we're ending
this thing cheap, man.

1576
01:42:43.951 --> 01:42:46.537
- No. What's mine is mine.
- No, come on, Walter.

1577
01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.831
- No funny stuff.
- All right. All right.

1578
01:42:48.914 --> 01:42:53.669
- No funny stuff.
- I got 4 bucks, almost 5.

1579
01:42:53.752 --> 01:42:56.338
- I got $18.
- What's mine is mine.

1580
01:42:56.421 --> 01:42:59.550
We fuck you up, man!
We takes the money!

1581
01:43:00.092 --> 01:43:01.426
Come and get it.

1582
01:43:02.761 --> 01:43:07.015
- We fuck you up!
- Show me what you got, nihilists.

1583
01:43:07.099 --> 01:43:09.560
- I fuck you!
- Walter, come on. He's got a sword.

1584
01:43:09.643 --> 01:43:11.854
Fucking dipshit with
a nine-toed woman!

1585
01:43:11.937 --> 01:43:15.774
I fuck you! Fuck you!
I fuck you!

1586
01:43:21.947 --> 01:43:23.615
- Take it easy, man.
- I fuck you!

1587
01:43:23.699 --> 01:43:25.617
- Take the $4.
- I fuck you!

1588
01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:30.998
I fuck you!

1589
01:43:31.081 --> 01:43:32.958
I'm gonna hit you with
the fucking ball, man.

1590
01:43:37.713 --> 01:43:39.840
- Hey, dickhead!
- Anti-Semite.

1591
01:43:40.799 --> 01:43:43.510
I fuck you in the ass!
I fuck you in the ass!

1592
01:43:43.594 --> 01:43:46.722
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1593
01:43:46.805 --> 01:43:48.807
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1594
01:43:55.063 --> 01:43:57.024
We got a man down, Dude!

1595
01:44:00.736 --> 01:44:01.945
Oh, God. They shot him, man.

1596
01:44:02.029 --> 01:44:04.239
- He's not shot. No, Dude.
- Are you shot, Donny?

1597
01:44:04.364 --> 01:44:06.258
There weren't
any shots fired.

1598
01:44:06.742 --> 01:44:09.995
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.

1599
01:44:10.537 --> 01:44:13.373
I'd go myself, but I'm pumping blood,
might pass out.

1600
01:44:13.457 --> 01:44:16.752
Rest easy, good buddy.
You're doing fine.

1601
01:44:16.835 --> 01:44:19.254
We got help choppering in.

1602
01:44:46.782 --> 01:44:48.450
Hello, gentlemen.

1603
01:44:48.533 --> 01:44:50.786
- You are the bereaved?
- Yeah, man.

1604
01:44:51.453 --> 01:44:54.122
Francis Donnelly,
pleased to meet you.

1605
01:44:54.206 --> 01:44:56.500
- Jeff Lebowski.
- Walter Sobchak.

1606
01:44:56.583 --> 01:44:58.835
The Dude actually is...

1607
01:44:59.878 --> 01:45:01.797
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

1608
01:45:03.632 --> 01:45:08.303
Yes. I understand you're taking
away the remains?

1609
01:45:08.387 --> 01:45:09.554
Yeah.

1610
01:45:10.305 --> 01:45:12.099
We have the urn.

1611
01:45:13.475 --> 01:45:15.686
I assume this is credit card?

1612
01:45:16.895 --> 01:45:17.980
Yeah.

1613
01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:34.079
What's this?

1614
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:36.498
Now, that's for the urn.

1615
01:45:36.581 --> 01:45:38.583
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

1616
01:45:39.376 --> 01:45:42.004
Yes. So we were informed.

1617
01:45:42.087 --> 01:45:45.841
However, we must, of course,
transmit the remains to you

1618
01:45:45.924 --> 01:45:47.509
in a receptacle.

1619
01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.554
That's $180.

1620
01:45:50.887 --> 01:45:54.808
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

1621
01:45:55.142 --> 01:45:57.310
- Well, can't we just...
- $180?

1622
01:45:57.394 --> 01:45:59.396
They range up to $3,000.

1623
01:46:00.188 --> 01:46:03.316
- We're...
- Can't we just rent it from you, you know?

1624
01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.194
Sir, this is a mortuary
not a rental house.

1625
01:46:06.319 --> 01:46:08.655
- We're scattering the fucking ashes!
- Walter, Walter.

1626
01:46:08.739 --> 01:46:11.241
Just because we're bereaved
doesn't make us saps.

1627
01:46:11.324 --> 01:46:13.702
Sir, please lower
your voices.

1628
01:46:13.785 --> 01:46:17.873
Man, don't you have, you know,
something else we can put him in?

1629
01:46:17.956 --> 01:46:18.999
You know?

1630
01:46:19.082 --> 01:46:22.127
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

1631
01:46:22.419 --> 01:46:24.004
God damn it!

1632
01:46:26.131 --> 01:46:27.799
Is there a Ralph's
around here?

1633
01:46:54.826 --> 01:46:57.496
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1634
01:46:58.747 --> 01:47:00.874
He was one of us.

1635
01:47:00.957 --> 01:47:04.878
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

1636
01:47:05.003 --> 01:47:08.757
And as a surfer he explored the beaches
of Southern California

1637
01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.635
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo

1638
01:47:11.718 --> 01:47:14.304
and up to Pismo.

1639
01:47:15.097 --> 01:47:16.348
He died...

1640
01:47:17.349 --> 01:47:21.436
He died as so many young men
of his generation, before his time.

1641
01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:24.689
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him,

1642
01:47:24.815 --> 01:47:28.110
as you took so many bright,
flowering young men

1643
01:47:28.193 --> 01:47:31.029
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

1644
01:47:31.113 --> 01:47:32.864
at Hill 364.

1645
01:47:34.157 --> 01:47:36.535
These young men
gave their lives,

1646
01:47:37.119 --> 01:47:38.578
and so did Donny.

1647
01:47:40.705 --> 01:47:42.707
Donny, who loved bowling.

1648
01:47:45.752 --> 01:47:46.753
And so,

1649
01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:50.757
Theodore Donald Kerabatsos,

1650
01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:57.180
in accordance with what we think
your dying wishes might well have been,

1651
01:47:58.515 --> 01:48:01.309
we commit your final
mortal remains

1652
01:48:02.227 --> 01:48:04.604
to the bosom of
the Pacific Ocean

1653
01:48:06.064 --> 01:48:08.066
which you loved so well.

1654
01:48:10.402 --> 01:48:12.487
Good night, sweet prince.

1655
01:48:27.627 --> 01:48:29.045
Shit.

1656
01:48:30.964 --> 01:48:33.008
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1657
01:48:34.801 --> 01:48:37.929
- Goddamn wind.
- Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

1658
01:48:38.013 --> 01:48:40.307
- You fucking asshole!
- Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1659
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:42.601
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man!

1660
01:48:42.684 --> 01:48:44.269
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

1661
01:48:44.352 --> 01:48:46.855
- What was that shit about Vietnam?
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1662
01:48:46.938 --> 01:48:49.232
What the fuck does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

1663
01:48:49.316 --> 01:48:51.377
- Dude, I'm sorry.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1664
01:48:51.401 --> 01:48:52.986
Dude, I'm sorry.

1665
01:48:55.906 --> 01:48:57.115
Fucking...

1666
01:49:04.122 --> 01:49:05.582
Fuck, Walter.

1667
01:49:07.459 --> 01:49:08.960
Come on, Dude.

1668
01:49:09.794 --> 01:49:11.463
Hey, fuck it, man.

1669
01:49:15.383 --> 01:49:17.010
Let's go bowling.

1670
01:50:11.523 --> 01:50:14.526
- Two oat sodas, Gary.
- Right. Good luck tomorrow.

1671
01:50:14.609 --> 01:50:18.071
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- I was sorry to hear about Donny.

1672
01:50:18.154 --> 01:50:21.032
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1673
01:50:21.866 --> 01:50:25.829
sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes, you know...

1674
01:50:25.912 --> 01:50:27.205
Hey, man.

1675
01:50:27.998 --> 01:50:31.167
- How do you do, Dude?
- I wondered if I'd see you again.

1676
01:50:31.251 --> 01:50:33.295
I wouldn't miss
the semis.

1677
01:50:33.378 --> 01:50:35.005
- Oh, yeah?
- How's things been going?

1678
01:50:35.088 --> 01:50:38.216
Well, you know,
strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

1679
01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:41.011
- Sure. I got you.
- Yeah.

1680
01:50:42.554 --> 01:50:43.596
Thanks, Gary.

1681
01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:46.016
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1682
01:50:46.099 --> 01:50:49.144
- Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
- Oh, yeah.

1683
01:50:49.227 --> 01:50:51.313
I know that you will.

1684
01:50:51.396 --> 01:50:54.733
Yeah. Well,
the Dude abides.

1685
01:50:58.737 --> 01:50:59.946
Walter.

1686
01:51:01.656 --> 01:51:03.616
The Dude abides.

1687
01:51:07.537 --> 01:51:10.874
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1688
01:51:12.167 --> 01:51:14.377
It's good knowing
he's out there,

1689
01:51:14.461 --> 01:51:18.548
the Dude, taking her easy
for all us sinners.

1690
01:51:21.259 --> 01:51:23.428
I sure hope
he makes the finals.

1691
01:51:25.055 --> 01:51:27.182
Well, that about does her.

1692
01:51:27.265 --> 01:51:28.767
Wraps her all up.

1693
01:51:30.352 --> 01:51:33.813
Things seem to have worked out
pretty good for the Dude and Walter.

1694
01:51:34.481 --> 01:51:37.776
And it was a pretty good story,
don't you think?

1695
01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:40.945
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

1696
01:51:41.613 --> 01:51:43.073
Parts anyway.

1697
01:51:44.616 --> 01:51:46.785
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1698
01:51:47.911 --> 01:51:52.957
But then I happen to know that
there's a little Lebowski on the way.

1699
01:51:54.626 --> 01:51:57.962
I guess that's the way
the whole darned human comedy keeps

1700
01:51:58.505 --> 01:52:00.840
perpetuating itself

1701
01:52:00.924 --> 01:52:03.093
down through the generations.

1702
01:52:03.593 --> 01:52:07.847
Westward the wagons,
across the sands of time until we...

1703
01:52:09.057 --> 01:52:12.268
Oh, look at me.
I'm rambling again.

1704
01:52:13.645 --> 01:52:16.147
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1705
01:52:16.648 --> 01:52:18.983
Catch you later on
down the trail.

1706
01:52:20.151 --> 01:52:23.279
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good sarsaparilla?
