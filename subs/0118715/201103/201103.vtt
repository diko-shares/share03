1
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,608
Good day Mam

2
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,443
Good day

3
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,042
Who is she, Mike?

4
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,184
I'm working on it

5
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,683
Fiona Birch

6
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,451
Alias Fiona Nielson
born in London, England, 1978

7
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,357
Wanted for murders in Spain
Brazil and United States

8
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,529
And here you're gonna like this

9
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,733
It says here she was kidnapped from
her parents when she was...

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,058
She was 12 years old

11
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,761
Madame M likes to start them young

12
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,736
I'm in the lobby. Where to now?

13
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,171
Look to your right

14
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,472
Take the VlP elevator up to 12th floor

15
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,709
He's in 1238

16
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,628
Hey guys

17
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,765
What took so long?

18
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,490
Nobody sells take away around here
Cappuccino, right?

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,064
Here you go, Mike

20
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,167
Why don't you cut him some slack
He's new on the job

21
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,699
To be a good agent Jack
you need to think fast

22
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,776
It shouldn't take you twenty minutes
to get a cup of coffee

23
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,905
Sorry, sir. Won't happen again

24
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,329
So why don't we just arrest her?

25
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,328
The point is to let her escape
so she brings us to Madame M

26
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,701
I like her technique

27
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,135
What technique?

28
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,812
You know, like Mata Hari

29
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,580
She uses her incredible body to either
get the secret from the enemy

30
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,341
Or...

31
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,212
Or what?

32
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,384
Or she'd kill you

33
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,223
You wanna take your little picnic outside
Jack?

34
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,394
Sorry, Mike

35
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,725
You got something else to eat?

36
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,968
Um, no

37
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,129
I think I need a sandwich, Jack

38
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:27,702
Now?

39
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,099
Yes now

40
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,278
Alright

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,990
Waiter?

42
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,751
Can I have 2 croissant sandwiches please?

43
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:49,724
Yes, sir

44
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,103
Jill!

45
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,429
Oh, shit!

46
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,313
Oh, shit!

47
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,692
May I join you?

48
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,897
You are an amazing fighter

49
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,274
Would you like to have this?

50
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,841
It's yours if you want it

51
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,180
Go ahead and choose whatever you like

52
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:14,921
I can take you to

53
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,253
where all the best fighters go

54
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,561
You can become one of them

55
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,224
Do you want to come with me?

56
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,331
Oh shit!

57
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:09,375
October 1 1th
Another girl has been reported missing...

58
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,276
...bringing the total to 40

59
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,615
Their ages are all around 13 years of age

60
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,448
Although their nationalities
and family background vary

61
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,655
it is interesting to note that
each of these girls...

62
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,327
...excels in either martial arts or sport

63
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,626
Ever since the Rome incident

64
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,459
Madame M and her organization have not
resurfaced

65
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,467
In the meantime, little girls are
disappearing all over the globe

66
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,533
Could it be... one female assassin dead...

67
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,545
and dozens more being trained to take
her place?

68
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,716
If that's the case, I'm afraid
these girls will be scarred for life...

69
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,283
and can never be helped

70
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,703
This is your new home

71
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,641
And these girls are your sisters

72
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,077
I want to go home

73
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,213
I want my mommy!

74
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,152
For the time being
you can think of me as your mommy

75
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,555
You are not my mommy
You can't tell me what to do

76
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,389
Do you really want to go?

77
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,393
Yes!

78
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,226
I don't like it here and I don't like you!

79
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,829
Alright, you can go now

80
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,537
Go

81
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,715
Girls!

82
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,518
I would love to officially welcome you
to a brand new world

83
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,624
Here every exercise
every meal and every class

84
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,259
will be with one thing in mind...

85
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,328
to create a team of world class fighters

86
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,724
Is that clear?

87
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,528
Yes, sir!

88
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,500
We are two hundred miles away from
the nearest island

89
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,239
And if you try to run away, you'll be shot

90
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,668
Any questions?

91
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,035
No sir!

92
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,337
Hi!

93
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,874
You're the one who came in with me
today right?

94
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:24,939
Yeah

95
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,144
My name is Charlene, what's yours?

96
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,345
Katherine

97
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,640
I like the name, Katherine

98
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,074
Thank you

99
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,546
Everybody, come! Come on!

100
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,649
I say we go now

101
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,455
tonight, as soon as they turn the lights out

102
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,689
There's only one guard in the tower and
one on the pier

103
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,199
If we can just get to that side of the bay
before they see us

104
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,564
there's a boat we can use to make
our escape

105
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,264
We'll have to row, but it's our only chance

106
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,439
I've seen that boat, we can't all fit in it

107
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,808
I didn't think everyone here has the guts
to go

108
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,915
Alright. So who's in?

109
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,880
Raise your hands if you want to go

110
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,822
What are you doing?
I want to go with them

111
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,390
You won't make it

112
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,824
Ready. First ready position!

113
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,560
First!

114
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,293
1, 2...

115
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,000
Change sides

116
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,068
1, 2. OK

117
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,603
1, 2...

118
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,964
1

119
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,177
2

120
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,977
3

121
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,904
4

122
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,749
5

123
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,178
6

124
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,314
I'm too tired, Katt

125
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,822
Don't stop. Keep going, Charlene!

126
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,791
Look, it's Ann-Marie, Renee

127
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:23,893
And Susan

128
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,360
Come on, keep going!

129
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,829
Move your ass. Go!

130
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,467
You people are barbaric. Go! Go! Go!

131
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,183
Move! Move! Go!

132
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,582
Go! Keep going!

133
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,453
Come on! Go! Go!

134
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,685
Come on, move your ass!

135
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,994
Use your legs. Use your arms. Go! Go!

136
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,726
Come on go!

137
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,402
Attack!

138
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,716
The central nervous system

139
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,057
and the delivery of electric pulses
from the brain to the rest of the body

140
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,631
depends almost entirely on your skeleton
network

141
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,496
and in particular the spinal column

142
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,705
Remember what I said about detaching
the C-5 vertebrate

143
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,534
It cuts the nerve cortex

144
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,575
instantly paralyzing your victim

145
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,106
Death by suffocation normally follows

146
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,525
Keep your back straight. Your head still

147
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,032
Wiggle your hip. Now stop here
And you pose

148
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,198
Turn

149
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,344
Stop. And turn

150
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,049
Today's lesson. Working through pain

151
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,945
To be a fighter, to be a killer

152
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,246
you must learn how to work with
the elements

153
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,214
I don't care if you are wet...

154
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,593
or if you are freezing

155
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,422
Your environment is your friend

156
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,424
It's your only friend

157
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,216
The water is so nice

158
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,320
I was sitting at the bottom of the ocean
Katt

159
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,819
So peaceful

160
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,257
Have you ever thought that
we would have to kill someone

161
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,589
That we don't even know?

162
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,467
I don't dare to

163
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:04,166
It's not up to you, this is our fate together

164
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,110
We can't run from it

165
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,603
I know I can't do it

166
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,606
Well...

167
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,714
We'll make a lot of money for our lives
from it

168
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,452
We cannot help to do it

169
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,385
Come on, let's go

170
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,000
This is not an exercise

171
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,708
Today's mission is to kill a group of
enemy soldiers

172
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,405
They are all armed and ready to attack

173
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,512
They will not show any mercy

174
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,408
You have to fight for your survival

175
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,812
Good luck ladies

176
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,628
Let's go! Let's go!

177
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,247
Are you alright?

178
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,385
Look, we knew from the very beginning
what this is all about

179
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,322
And eventually we would have to kill

180
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,095
We're just an experiment to her

181
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:16,103
That's all. Survival of the fittest

182
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,001
Everything we're learning here...

183
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,906
is what we're gonna need out there

184
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,876
I know that. But today...

185
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,815
today just makes me feel worse about
everything

186
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,315
Forget about today

187
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,613
Think about our future

188
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,789
That's what I use to do as a kid

189
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,984
Then Madame showed up and saved me

190
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,899
You were awesome out there hanging
upside down from that tree and shit

191
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,937
Snap. Man, you should teach me that
sometime

192
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,239
Here let me help you

193
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,771
Hey you're tense. You should relax a bit

194
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,377
If there is anything, just ask
I can help you

195
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,832
Man, did you see me today?

196
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,234
That fucker tried to sneak up on me

197
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,703
But I was really for that shit

198
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,603
It felt so good to kill him

199
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,780
Hello?

200
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,081
When I first came here

201
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,582
I had a boyfriend back home

202
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,256
We use to ride our bikes everyday
after school

203
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,529
My first memory is cleaning up around
the boxing ring

204
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,231
I tried to stay away from such a lifestyle

205
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,132
and finally I chose to fight in the ring

206
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,700
You and I are so different, Katt

207
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,738
And yet I can't imagine my life
without you

208
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,349
Listen up. Here is your assignment

209
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,095
Kill the nearest girl and bring her dead
body outside

210
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,193
Anyone who isn't outside in 2 minutes...

211
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,595
will be shot

212
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,941
Wait, this is so stupid

213
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,205
Why are we killing each other?

214
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,413
Because there are ten guys waiting outside
with M16s

215
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,916
If we refuse
there is no way she can kill us all

216
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,782
There isn't time for this
We have our orders

217
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,553
Congratulations ladies
You are the survivors

218
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,287
You show your courage and your strength

219
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,759
in every imaginable situation

220
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,296
Take a good look around you

221
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,127
These girls are not your friends anymore

222
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,370
Only one of you will survive tomorrow's
exercise

223
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,602
Who will that be?

224
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,106
Get some sleep, ladies

225
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,072
Tomorrow is graduation day for
one of you

226
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,258
This is bullshit!

227
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,021
The whole thing was bullshit from day one!

228
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,165
I was wondering when it would come
to this

229
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,335
Tomorrow is just another exercise

230
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,002
That's it

231
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,117
Katt, if we have to face each other

232
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,849
Promise me you won't hold back

233
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,625
Get some rest

234
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:31,284
Today is the day
one of you will earn the right to survive

235
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,585
Some of you may feel that
I have treated you unfairly

236
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,592
In fact, I'm afraid that I might have
protected you...

237
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,732
too much from the harsh reality of
the world outside

238
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,701
All of you will soon be given a number

239
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,067
Girl number 1 enters the cage first

240
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,208
She faces girl number 2 in a fight to death

241
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,611
The survivor must then face two more girls

242
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,819
number 3 and 4

243
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,786
The winner then faces three more girls

244
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,051
Number 5 to 7

245
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,453
But that's not fair!

246
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,559
That's right. Life isn't fair

247
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,199
You're sending us to our death

248
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,794
Maybe, but an assassin knows...

249
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,771
the path to your own mortality is only
a footstep away

250
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,603
What if girl number 1 survives
the first three rounds?

251
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,542
If she survives, she'll have to fight
the last four girls

252
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,010
One on four

253
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,911
The fighting is over when only one of
you remains

254
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,184
Behind you is a box containing numbers

255
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,452
Choose one and accept your fate

256
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,728
I want out of here. I don't want to die!

257
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,434
You have no choice

258
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,068
All you can choose is your weapon

259
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,634
Oh look, we're in the same group!

260
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,773
We can be like a team

261
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,204
I watch your back, you watch mine

262
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,809
It's a win-win situation!

263
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,050
From the moment I realized that
I was an orphan

264
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,816
I knew I didn't have future

265
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:20,257
Charlene, if I die in this cage tonight

266
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,462
you have to remember me

267
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,515
We will always remember each other

268
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,052
Charlene, don't be stupid!

269
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,488
She took my number
I'm supposed to go first!

270
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,191
Ladies, there is only one rule inside
the cage

271
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,362
No matter what method you use to kill
your opponent

272
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,034
you cannot leave, you cannot surrender

273
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,103
You have no friends, no support

274
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,170
All you can believe in is yourself

275
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,613
Today you fight until you die...

276
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,872
or until you are the last survivor

277
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:23,187
It's all very simple, ladies. Live or die

278
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,723
Do not disappoint me

279
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,257
We've been friends for six years

280
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,091
I don't want to kill you

281
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,576
Maybe now you understand survival of
the fittest...

282
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,941
and the need to eliminate the weak

283
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,233
Kill her! Kill her!

284
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,028
Shut up!

285
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:13,930
Get off me!

286
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,261
Charlene, are you alright?

287
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,543
Oh my god!

288
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,589
You have to win

289
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,032
I will for both of us

290
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,162
Don't quit on me

291
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,561
If we join forces, we'll be invincible

292
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,070
Nobody can touch us

293
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,545
I am invincible

294
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,969
You have no chance!

295
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,125
Don't kill her

296
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,254
Please

297
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:37,838
Stop!

298
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,502
That's it!

299
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,307
Bravo, girls!

300
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,141
What a terrific performance

301
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,075
You have exceeded my expectations

302
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,613
I have decided to break my own rules...

303
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,847
and keep all three of you

304
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,918
I'm glad we can finally sit down and
have dinner together

305
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,348
Let's do this more often in the future

306
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,220
To be honest with you ladies
I'm still in shock about the other day

307
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,224
It was never my plan to keep three of you

308
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,759
But I'm glad that I did

309
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,357
Let's have a drink

310
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:38,927
Cheers

311
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,036
Jing, taste your wine...

312
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,835
and tell me the year and the label

313
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,011
Petrus, 1971

314
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,380
Katt, your's?

315
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,755
Vega Sicilia, 1985

316
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,163
Hmmm. Good

317
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,299
Charlene?

318
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,534
It's table wine

319
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,867
Very good

320
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,939
You ladies know your wine

321
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,036
In a month

322
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,443
you'll leave here with new identities

323
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,812
You will be making more than
five million dollars a year

324
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:30,979
Soon

325
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,350
you'll become three of the most
wanted women in this world

326
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:38,621
In five years our contract be over

327
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,796
You can stay working for me or
you can go free

328
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,396
Are you okay?

329
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,869
I feel weak. She poisoned us

330
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,749
Now. I've only given you...

331
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,212
a mild sedative to help you relax

332
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,644
After today
your body no longer belongs to you

333
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,785
It is now your greatest weapon

334
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:14,616
You must be willing...

335
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,158
to do anything to please a man
no matter how vile

336
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,429
Because a man's happiest moment...

337
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,633
is also his weakest

338
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,138
Okay, let's go

339
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,383
This way, this way

340
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,313
He's waiting for you

341
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,554
Yes more... please more

342
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:16,791
More...

343
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,803
Do you know why you are here?

344
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,869
To please you

345
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,571
You are the most unusual young woman

346
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,680
I'm glad you think so

347
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,779
I'm sure my cousin thought the same thing...

348
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,410
before you killed him
