1
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:12,910
What will the moon shine upon tonight?
A thick cloud blankets the sky

2
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,780
ONE

3
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,780
TWO

4
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:25,380
Who is holding you tonight?
Alone in the rain, I cry

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,780
THREE

6
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:51,110
Ashamed at thinking we could understand
each other completely

7
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:55,780
FOUR

8
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:57,740
I go up to the rooftop with a Dazai book
in my hands and grumble about this world

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,740
POISON

10
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:05,630
When I spat into the sky,
it just fell back on me

11
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,780
URAHARA'S SHOP

12
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:12,630
I consider myself a traveler,
but I hate losing my way and making detours

13
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,340
Dear Rukia,

14
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:16,220
Under a roof that protects me from wind and rain,

15
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,340
We'll be waiting

16
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:19,730
I look at the world through Google

17
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:26,860
Words of love that never reach you

18
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,340
at the castle ruins
of East 15.

19
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:34,030
What will the moon shine upon tonight?
A thick cloud blankets the sky

20
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,360
Dear Rukia,

21
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:45,330
Who is holding you tonight?
Alone in the rain, I cry

22
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,360
We'll be waiting

23
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,360
at the castle ruins
 of East 15.

24
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:52,380
My unyielding bluff and pride follows
me into my relationships

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,410
I've completed it.

26
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:59,350
Making it hard to even hold on
to the hand that is letting go

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,780
Who's there?

28
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:06,440
Though I knew I'd never see you again

29
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:13,650
If I can't see the moon tonight,
I'll wait for a break in the clouds

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,700
What is this device?!

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Master Mayuri.

32
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:25,170
When you look up at the sky tonight,
can you see the moon?

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,650
Is there something wrong?

34
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:39,260
I want to go out into the wilderness
and see the angelic light

35
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,040
Who are you?!

36
01:31:53,530 --> 01:32:02,410
I get tired of myself and the way I am

37
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:09,460
I talk big like everything is stupid,
like I know everything

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,210
Master Mayuri?

39
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:16,800
I hide my incapable self and conceal the truth

40
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,130
Stay away! Are you here to apprehend me?!

41
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,130
Sir?

42
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:23,720
All it takes to see the invisible is to close your eyes

43
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:36,240
Even if you're not here,
even if we can't see the moon tonight

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,540
Stay away! Stay away!

45
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:11,440
Hey! Somebody!

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,730
Master Mayuri, wha–?!

47
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:17,110
Why won't anyone come to rescue me?

48
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,730
Let go of me!

49
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:25,660
Ichigo! You haven't forgotten me,
have you?

50
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,290
<i>Abnormal levels of Spiritual Pressure
have been confirmed</i>

51
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:32,700
First Sis, and now you? Dammit!

52
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,580
<i>inside Tower Seven of the Department of Research and Development!</i>

53
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:37,170
Sis! Sis!

54
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,540
<i>Destructive activity has
been detected on the top floor.</i>

55
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:40,840
Sis!

56
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,860
<i>An extremely high density cloud of Reishi
is currently spreading throughout the area!</i>

57
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,430
Don't forget me!

58
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,590
<i>I repeat.</i>

59
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,760
<i>Requesting emergency assistance from all
squad members and the Kido Corps!</i>

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,620
What the hell?

61
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,340
I know.

62
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,780
Retreat!

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,440
What are those things?!

64
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Move quickly!

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,060
What the–?!

66
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,580
Captain Kurotsuchi, please stop!

67
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,040
Don't come near me!

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,480
What're you going to do to me?!

69
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,380
Hey.

70
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,470
So you've finally lost it, eh?

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,130
Huh?!

72
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,570
What is this?!

73
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,940
Damn nuisance.

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,140
What's happening?!

75
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,580
<i>No! You mustn't go.</i>

76
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,540
Who's there?!

77
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,250
We will erase...

78
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,020
your existence!

79
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,260
The Seireitei...

80
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,930
Hurry to high ground!

81
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,660
Serves them right.

82
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,790
I hope every Soul Reaper dies.

83
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,290
All they do is take. All we do is lose.

84
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,670
What was that just now?

85
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,400
What's that you're doing?

86
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,550
Reading the letter Sis left behind.

87
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,370
It's written in a code,
so I don't know what it means.

88
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,830
Huh?

89
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,850
Let me see...
It's just a bunch of gibberish.

90
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,690
"This drawing is your clue"? What the heck?

91
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,260
Don't go trashing her artistic drawing!

92
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,030
This is stupid.

93
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,300
And besides, who's "Sis"?

94
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,410
Huh?

95
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,370
Sis is Sis, of course!

96
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,670
What're you talking about?!

97
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,370
Did you become senile?!

98
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,950
You're the one who's senile.

99
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,330
I'm beat.

100
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm calling it a day.

101
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,130
Hey. We're not done yet, you bastard.

102
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,810
<i>Ichigo!</i>

103
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
<i>Let's go, Ichigo.</i>

104
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,150
<i>Fool!</i>

105
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,570
<i>Idiot!</i>

106
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,470
<i>I'm not going to thank you!</i>

107
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,750
<i>You must become a Soul Reaper.</i>

108
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,760
Rukia...

109
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,160
Hey, Kon!

110
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,010
Wake up!

111
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,350
What is it now?

112
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,400
This drawing that looks like a cockroach
with a watermelon next to it...

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,610
Could it be a rhinoceros beetle?

114
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,190
Which means...

115
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,550
"Returning to the Soul Society for
matters to attend to."

116
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,980
"Will return in a few days,
so be good boys and wait for me, dummies. Rukia."

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
Soul Society...

118
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,300
Please.

119
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,570
Oh, thanks, Ururu.

120
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,040
So... you and... uh...

121
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,320
Rukia Kuchiki!

122
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,820
Ah, yes! Rukia Kuchiki.

123
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,700
And who is that?

124
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,950
What're you talking about?!

125
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,490
It's Rukia, one of your best customers!

126
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,410
One of my best customers?

127
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,870
Oh yes, there is such a name here.

128
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,540
You see?

129
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,090
But... I'm sorry, I really don't recall such a person.

130
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,220
What's going on?

131
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,680
Beats me.

132
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,680
But for a second there,
you also forgot about Sis, remember?!

133
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,560
Did something happen to Rukia?

134
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,290
Uh...

135
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,980
I don't know if this has anything
to do with this Rukia person,

136
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,400
but an unbelievable incident happened
last night at the Seireitei.

137
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,150
Incident?

138
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:19,030
Yes. Squad 12 captain Mayuri Kurotsuchi
lost his mind and destroyed his facility.

139
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,600
One third of the Seireitei apparently is in shambles.

140
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,870
What?!

141
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,210
If these two occurrences are connected,

142
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,440
it could mean that something is
affecting our memories.

143
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,380
Be that as it may, what is your
relationship with this Rukia?

144
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,410
She's...

145
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,580
a close friend!

146
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,890
She's my beloved Sis!

147
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,900
Ichigo! Let's go! To the Soul Society!

148
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,900
Right.

149
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,550
Urahara, I need you to open the Senkaimon.

150
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,730
I see.

151
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,750
It appears the abnormal leakage of Reishi has calmed down.

152
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,650
Each of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads

153
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,590
have begun deploying inside the grounds to determine the cause.

154
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,360
Damn!

155
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,780
Good grief.

156
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,710
I..Ichigo! It's t-terrible.

157
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,270
L..Look at this!

158
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,290
Yeah.

159
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,650
H-Hey...

160
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,470
What kind of joke is this?

161
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,760
It's no joke.

162
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,620
You think everyone's been wiped out?

163
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,600
I don't know about the captains, but...

164
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,680
Where's Sis?

165
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,310
Sis is all right, isn't she? Isn't she?!

166
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,830
Shut up! Keep quiet.

167
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,900
Let's find Rukia.

168
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,040
The gate's closed.

169
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,080
They're in our way.

170
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,630
That's...

171
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,880
You know him?

172
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,320
By face.

173
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,780
Hisagi!

174
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
What the hell happened here?

175
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,180
Do it.

176
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,640
What is that?

177
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,720
It's coming.

178
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,870
Hyapporankan!

179
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,240
What the–?!

180
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,730
Here it comes!

181
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,400
Hey! Don't run, you guys!

182
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,800
This is the path we walk with Rukia.

183
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,510
Let's go.

184
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,890
Hey, what was that just now?

185
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,920
Yeah...

186
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,380
What's with all these people?

187
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,050
Huh?! What's going on?!

188
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,510
That mask... Who are you?!

189
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,030
I-Ichigo, weren't they supposed to be your friends?!

190
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,980
Hisagi, it's me! Ichigo Kurosaki!

191
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,160
Apprehend him!

192
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,870
Yes, sir!

193
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,870
Yes, sir!

194
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,120
Just a minute!

195
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,530
You damn intruder!

196
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,850
Hey, Ichigo!

197
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,350
I don't know what's going on here,
but doesn't this look bad for us?

198
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,650
Hisagi, I have no desire to fight you!

199
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,400
Stop!

200
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,400
Stop!

201
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,810
Damn intruder!

202
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,830
Abarai! Don't let him get away!

203
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,770
Is this all your doing?!

204
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,340
What?!

205
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,050
It's me, Ichigo! Don't you recognize me?!

206
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,820
What're you talking about?!

207
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,840
Stop it, Renji!

208
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,850
I don't want to fight you!

209
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,040
Bastard... How do you know my name?

210
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,230
Listen to me, Renji! Rukia's in trouble!

211
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,460
Rukia?

212
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,420
What are you babbling on about?

213
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,860
Don't tell me... you've forgotten about Rukia as well?

214
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,880
It's Rukia we're talking about!

215
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,110
Rukia?

216
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,920
There's no way you'd forget about her!

217
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,870
Come on, Renji!

218
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,770
Stop talking nonsense!

219
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,050
Renji!

220
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,880
What's going on?!

221
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,050
That's what I'd like to know!

222
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,260
Follow Abarai!

223
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,890
Yes, sir!

224
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,890
Yes, sir!

225
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,770
What're you going to do?

226
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,980
For now, we'll...

227
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
You're...

228
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,340
You're not getting away!

229
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,740
Komamura.

230
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,950
There he is!

231
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,810
Damn.

232
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,580
Hang on tight!

233
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,770
Oh, I will.

234
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,580
Curse you!

235
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,170
Bankai! Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh!

236
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,530
What's this humongous thing?!

237
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,740
Look out! Here it comes!

238
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,370
Getsugatensho!

239
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,910
This place is...

240
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,660
<i>Gimme back my water! I'll kill you!</i>

241
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,420
<i>Quickly!</i>

242
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Hanging Dog...

243
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,530
Rukia!

244
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,750
Hey. What is with you!

245
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,770
Who are you?!

246
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,990
Who are you people?

247
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,660
Sister...

248
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,080
She won't recognize you unless
she can see your face clearly.

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,600
Yes, I know that.

250
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,290
Rukia, look... Look at us.

251
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,870
Damage report.

252
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,440
The damage from the Reishi leak covers 200
spirit miles in the east-west direction,

253
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,940
extending over one-third of the Seireitei grounds.

254
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,440
What is the status of the casualties?

255
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,090
We've never seen anything like it.

256
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,840
They were enveloped by Reishi which
turned into petrified stone.

257
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,370
At present, we can't even confirm
if they're dead or alive.

258
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,520
What about Kurotsuchi?

259
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,480
It appears he lacks a grasp of many things.

260
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,940
The current situation,
and even things about himself...

261
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,920
It's as though he's lost
a portion of his memory.

262
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,550
Captain Komamura.

263
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,280
I am told you engaged an unidentified intruder

264
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,970
wearing a squad uniform in battle.

265
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,970
Yes.

266
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,250
The intruder possessed a Hollow-like mask,
and I believe his Spiritual Pressure is at captain-level.

267
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,820
Are you sure?

268
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,710
I'm positive.

269
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:03,110
The thing that I don't understand is
that he seems to be very familiar with us.

270
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,180
Captain Kuchiki...

271
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,080
In particular, he identified himself to Lieutenant Abarai
and appeared to be speaking to him.

272
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,390
With regard to that,

273
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,380
Abarai reports that it was someone
he had never seen before.

274
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,320
This is most disturbing.

275
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,780
Regarding what?

276
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,090
About everything that's happened to us...
myself included.

277
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,740
There is a crisis at hand!

278
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,020
Consider this the most serious threat
in the history of the Seireitei.

279
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,210
All squads are to coordinate their efforts
to find and apprehend the intruder!

280
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,660
I'm so sorry! Forgive me! Please don't kill me!

281
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,540
Where am I?

282
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,830
In an underground sewer passage.

283
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,530
I was cleaning here when you suddenly fell from above.

284
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,840
Your treatment is as incredible as ever!

285
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,630
Huh?

286
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,090
You know about me?

287
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,350
Come to think of it...

288
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,460
I seem to recall treating you before.

289
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,880
I-I'm sorry. I'm sure I'm just imagining it.

290
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,800
Don't get our hopes up like that.

291
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,310
Let me guess!

292
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,270
You're troubled right now, aren't you?

293
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,420
You can tell?

294
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,670
I can.

295
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:44,170
When we treat our patients,
we also touch their souls with our palms

296
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,180
and feel the pain of their wounds
and the pain in their hearts.

297
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,620
I guess worrying about things here won't do any good.

298
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,080
Are we leaving?

299
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,540
Yeah.

300
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,470
Okay!

301
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,560
Up I go.

302
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,940
Thanks for your help, Hanataro!

303
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,960
Oh, don't mention it.

304
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,470
How did he know my name?

305
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,910
Here Rukia, this will make you feel better.

306
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,550
How is it?

307
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,960
Good.

308
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,400
I'm glad!

309
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,930
Can I ask a question?

310
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,970
Sure.

311
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,140
I know the two of you.

312
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,520
But I'm sorry. I can't remember clearly.

313
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,340
When did I receive this letter from you?

314
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,980
Pretty good, don't you think?

315
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,800
I mimicked the style of the drawings
you used to do for us.

316
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,260
I was sure you'd recognize it.

317
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,780
Why didn't you write your names?

318
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,120
Because we don't have any.

319
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,290
What? You have no names?

320
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,630
But you promised to give us names.

321
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,490
I... promised you?

322
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,010
Yup. In the World of the Living,
parents give their children names.

323
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,470
That's why you said you would give us names, Rukia.

324
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,660
I would name you...

325
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,560
Yes!

326
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,990
<i>For goodness sakes, what were you doing to get so wet?</i>

327
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,700
<i>What were you going to tell us, Rukia?</i>

328
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,660
<i>What is it?</i>

329
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,330
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

330
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,130
<i>You two don't have names, right?</i>

331
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,500
<i>If you wouldn't mind, would you let me name you?</i>

332
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,340
<i>Not having names can be quite...</i>

333
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>What's the matter?</i>

334
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,300
<i>If you don't want to, I won't force you.</i>

335
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,740
<i>I'm so happy!</i>

336
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,560
<i>I've always wanted you to give us names.</i>

337
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,700
<i>Rukia...</i>

338
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,680
<i>Name us!</i>

339
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,690
<i>Please do it!</i>

340
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,060
<i>Name us!</i>

341
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,060
<i>Name us!</i>

342
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,670
<i>Actually, I've already decided on names.</i>

343
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,020
<i>Yay!</i>

344
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,020
<i>Yay!</i>

345
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,730
<i>We're gonna have names!</i>

346
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,530
<i>Now, now, don't get so excited.</i>

347
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,530
<i>Yay!</i>

348
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,860
<i>Rukia!</i>

349
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,860
<i>Rukia!</i>

350
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,090
It's coming to me.

351
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,850
You were those small siblings!

352
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,860
What are our names, Rukia?

353
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,960
What? You mean I didn't give you your names?

354
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,270
Rukia! What's wrong?

355
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:41,970
Are you all right?!

356
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,900
Yes, it's nothing.

357
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,570
Forgive me. I can't remember clearly.

358
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,130
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,860
What was I doing until now?

360
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,910
Well...

361
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,660
You were sleeping, Rukia.

362
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,560
For a long time.

363
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,620
Sleeping?

364
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,420
That's right. You were hurt and sleeping.

365
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,530
So take it easy. We'll always be with you.

366
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,680
Okay.

367
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,650
Is something the matter?

368
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,690
It's nothing.

369
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,470
That photo!

370
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,570
It's Sis!

371
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,160
Keep your voice down.

372
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,890
Sorry for sneaking in like this.

373
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,850
I don't want to cause a commotion here.

374
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,670
That's a photo of Hisana, isn't it?

375
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,820
She looks a lot like Rukia.

376
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,280
Don't you sense something, too?

377
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,240
What're you talking about?

378
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,340
Don't play dumb!

379
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,200
Hisana is Rukia's older sister, isn't she?

380
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,830
Rukia...

381
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,790
That's right. Rukia.

382
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,400
Rukia is your younger sister-in-law.

383
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,690
The younger sister you tried to protect
even if it meant breaking the rules.

384
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,930
So you don't remember either, huh?

385
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,120
You...

386
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,080
How do you know about my wife, Hisana?

387
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,040
Because...

388
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,040
Ichigo!

389
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,590
Stand down.

390
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,870
Captain!

391
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,430
Damn you!

392
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,830
Why are you here?!

393
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,790
Wait, Renji!

394
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,230
Shut up!

395
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,750
Roar, Zabimaru!

396
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,090
You never were a guy who listened to reason!

397
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,550
What?!

398
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,220
That's why I'm going to pound it into you!

399
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,500
Bankai!

400
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,550
What's the matter, Renji?

401
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,510
Damn it.

402
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,620
Aren't you going to release your Bankai?

403
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,910
Bankai? Me?!

404
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,160
You trained so you could save Rukia!

405
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,430
Don't know what you're talking about!

406
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,520
Roar, Zabimaru!

407
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,840
Remember, dammit!

408
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,390
What're you trying to make me remember?!

409
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,030
Don't push it!

410
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,650
Scatter...

411
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:58,110
Hisana was born in South Rukon District 78...
in Hanging Dog.

412
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,730
Thanks.

413
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,810
Rukia...

414
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,460
Can I come over?

415
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,090
Sure.

416
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,090
Rukia... Is something wrong?

417
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,600
I feel like I'm breathing the air in this
town for the first time in ages.

418
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,560
But I feel uneasy,
not knowing anything about myself.

419
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,520
Rukia...

420
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,630
The two of you waited for me all this time.

421
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,720
Waiting for the names I said
I would give you so long ago...

422
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,640
I will remember those names, I promise.

423
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,120
Yes.

424
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,840
What is it?

425
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,530
That... hill...

426
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,640
That's right. It was that hill.

427
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,570
Rukia...

428
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,810
What is the matter with me?

429
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,480
<i>You were never a guy who listened to reason!</i>

430
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,090
Zabimaru...

431
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,490
Why didn't you use your Bankai?

432
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,450
W..What?

433
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,720
Stop being intimidated!

434
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,420
Your soul should know us.

435
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:05,110
Have you forgotten the exchange your soul had with us?

436
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,380
How pathetic!

437
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,840
What're you talking about?

438
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,630
<i>Byakuya... Byakuya...</i>

439
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,480
<i>Did you go to the Rukon District again yesterday?</i>

440
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,250
<i>Yes. I'm sorry.</i>

441
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,710
<i>It's all right. I'm not scolding you.</i>

442
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,530
<i>I was concerned about your health.</i>

443
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,900
<i>Byakuya... It is something I have to do.</i>

444
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,910
<i>Hisana!</i>

445
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,290
<i>I'm all right, Byakuya.</i>

446
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,850
<i>No, you're not. You have to take it easy.</i>

447
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,340
<i>No, I must continue searching.</i>

448
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,590
<i>No matter what it does to my body.</i>

449
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,280
Search... For what?

450
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,500
I have news to report.

451
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,840
The Hakuto Gate has been breached.

452
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,860
Is it the same intruder?

453
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:58,100
Yes. A team made up of members from Squad 10
and other volunteers are already in pursuit.

454
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,080
I see...

455
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,040
But how is it that this intruder is
so familiar with the premises?

456
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,450
Hey...

457
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,450
Huh?

458
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,180
Are you sure this is where Sis lived?

459
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,140
Yeah. That's what I was told.

460
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,520
Huh?

461
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,520
Huh?

462
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,920
There's no way Sis would be in a place like this.

463
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,470
Hey!

464
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,160
Yeah.

465
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,930
It's Rukia.

466
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,870
Let's go!

467
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,490
That's right.

468
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,870
I grew up here with my friends, and...

469
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,730
Sis!

470
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,690
Rukia!

471
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,180
You're all right...

472
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,580
Sis...

473
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,160
Who are you?

474
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,180
What? Sis?

475
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,620
What're you talking about, Rukia?

476
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,310
It's me.

477
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:29,980
Rukia?

478
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,980
Soul Reaper!

479
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,550
What'd you come here for?

480
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,510
Who are you guys?

481
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Rukia...

482
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,240
Stay back.

483
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,900
Who are you?! How do you know my name?!

484
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,860
What about me? You remember me, don't you?

485
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,320
Quiet! Funny-looking creature!

486
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,510
F..Funny-looking creature?

487
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,260
Rukia...

488
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,160
You really don't remember me?

489
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,420
Come on, Rukia.

490
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,130
It's me, Ichigo!

491
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,020
You're...

492
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,190
Rukia!

493
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,030
It's that guy's fault!

494
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,030
Soul Reaper!

495
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,770
H-Hey!

496
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,870
What's with you all of a sudden?!

497
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,710
Stop it!

498
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,230
Rukia!

499
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,040
That's right! Kill that Soul Reaper!

500
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,650
I said stop!

501
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,880
What the–?!

502
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,980
That wasn't Flash Step.

503
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,120
What are you guys?

504
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,980
You're our enemy!

505
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,400
What was that just now?

506
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,660
It felt like it passed right through Zangetsu.

507
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,450
What?!

508
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,160
Hey, you!

509
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,330
Rukia...

510
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,290
Who's there?

511
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,680
Now there's someone I
haven't seen in a long time.

512
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,000
An unpleasant face to see, as always.

513
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,650
It would seem you remember me.

514
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,460
So what's the big deal?

515
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,010
Surely you didn't come all this way
just to confirm that, did you?

516
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,470
You're right.
I thought I'd interrogate you a bit.

517
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,120
And if I refuse?

518
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,330
You have no option.

519
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,650
Your memories became confused, and after that,
it seems our memories of "a certain person" disappeared.

520
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,660
What are you talking about?

521
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,260
This is what I think happened.

522
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:36,960
I'm guessing both you and
that person ran into the same enemy.

523
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,230
If that was the case...

524
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,670
Do you recognize this?

525
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,140
I had the hardest time finding
this in your room.

526
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,350
Though in your present state,
you probably don't even remember.

527
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,580
Now then, let us begin

528
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,690
the process of regaining what we have all lost.

529
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,700
No matter how I look at it,
this series of troubling incidents

530
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,200
has to be the doing of those
strange guys we met earlier!

531
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,660
And they took Sis away.

532
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,980
But I can't believe she doesn't even
remember who we are.

533
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:22,210
Sure hurts us here in the heart, doesn't it?

534
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,210
Say something, man!

535
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,780
There's nothing I can do.

536
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,430
They're both the same. Rukia, Renji...

537
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,750
In their minds, I don't exist.

538
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,980
I held on to the hope that
Rukia alone would be different.

539
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,570
You little...

540
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,450
You disappoint me, Ichigo!

541
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,950
What are you acting so depressed about?!

542
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,850
Did you whack your head or something?

543
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,020
You realized that Sis was in danger
even in the World of the Living.

544
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,360
Even when everyone forgot about her, you didn't!

545
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,610
You and Sis are still connected!

546
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,140
I'll save her, even if I have to do it alone!

547
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,290
I don't care if she's forgotten about me!

548
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,020
You can just sit there forever
and think about it like a moron!

549
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,450
Who was that guy?!

550
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,430
Are you all right, Rukia?

551
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,400
I know that guy.

552
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,650
Yes, I know that Soul Reaper.

553
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,860
I wasn't asleep this whole time, was I?

554
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,470
What was I doing until now?

555
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,640
Why do I know that Soul Reaper?!

556
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,850
I don't know.

557
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:57,850
Stop it, Rukia.

558
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,470
You're lying!

559
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,830
It's the truth!

560
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,980
After all, we were at a faraway place, so...

561
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
A faraway place?

562
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,800
We finally made it back.

563
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,700
We came back to see you, Rukia.

564
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,020
It took about a hundred years, though.

565
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,850
That long?

566
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,110
Rukia! Rukia...!

567
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,980
Soul Reapers are all alike.

568
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,800
They exist to only take away!

569
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,720
That's right. They took everything.

570
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,410
Happy things, fun things...

571
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,950
Even you, Rukia!

572
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,460
But...

573
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,440
Rukia? What's wrong?

574
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,880
Rukia! Rukia!

575
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,780
Rukia.

576
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,160
It's their fault.

577
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,120
Sister?

578
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,650
The Soul Reapers!

579
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,560
<i>What's that you're doing?</i>

580
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,900
<i>Hey! Don't look, you fool!</i>

581
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,400
<i>I didn't look.
Isn't that why I asked?</i>

582
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,490
<i>It's a surprise for later!</i>

583
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,250
I was looking all over for that!

584
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,230
You! When did you steal that
lovely letter from me?!

585
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,300
Man, she's too good for a loser like you!

586
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,090
Kon...

587
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,700
Huh?

588
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,410
Sorry about that.

589
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,620
Huh?

590
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,470
Man...

591
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,330
I never thought you could teach me something.

592
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,400
I have a lot to learn, I guess.

593
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,770
What?!

594
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,150
Hey, don't be so full of yourself!

595
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,610
So did you pull yourself together or what?!

596
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,490
Kon...

597
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,050
Uh... Y-Yes?

598
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,510
Thanks.

599
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,470
Huh?

600
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,910
W-Well, I'm glad I got through to you!

601
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,440
I mean, you also forgot about
Sis when this all started, remember?

602
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,400
My ties with her are deeper than yours, after all!

603
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,180
You can't escape anymore!

604
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,820
Give yourselves up quietly, intruders!

605
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,870
That's quite a show of strength, Toshiro.

606
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,850
What?

607
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,300
How do you know Captain Hitsugaya's name?

608
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,010
Of course I know it! I'm supposed to!

609
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:57,820
Ikkaku.

610
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,070
Yumichika.

611
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,930
I wouldn't forget you– even if you've forgotten me.

612
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,500
Huh?! What's that mean?

613
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,650
It's just nonsense, Ikkaku.

614
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,610
Who the hell are you?

615
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,820
I'm Substitute Soul Reaper,
Ichigo Kurosaki!

616
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,510
Substitute Soul Reaper, you say?

617
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,740
Then show me... the proof!

618
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,200
Bastard...

619
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,390
Stand back, Madarame.

620
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,660
I'll handle this.

621
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,190
It appears the reports were correct.

622
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,170
You are familiar with our style of fighting.

623
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,130
I'll ask you once more. Who are you?!

624
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,110
Like I said, I'm Ichigo Kurosaki!

625
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,550
I don't know you!

626
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,420
Bakudo 63: Sajosabaku!

627
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,660
Roar!

628
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,010
Zabimaru!

629
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,000
You are...

630
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,280
What is the meaning of this, Abarai?!

631
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:12,980
Get up.

632
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:14,790
Renji...

633
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,590
Don't get all friendly with me!

634
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,150
You're the enemy! An intruder who disrupted the Seireitei!

635
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,930
You're supposed to be the enemy!

636
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,360
But...

637
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,930
I can't think of you as an enemy.

638
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,060
I know in my head that you're the enemy,

639
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,330
but my soul...
is telling me something different!

640
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,500
That's why I'm following my soul!

641
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,720
Abarai...

642
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,180
I'm sorry, Captain Hitsugaya!
Please let us through.

643
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,410
Treachery will not go unpunished.

644
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,830
Head Captain...

645
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,710
The intruder must be captured.

646
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,250
Please hear me out, Head Captain!

647
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,310
That's right! We can talk this out!

648
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,190
You're wasting your breath!

649
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,900
Apprehend them!

650
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,680
You?!

651
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,640
You're...

652
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,830
Kisuke Urahara?

653
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,880
Urahara...

654
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,690
It's been a while, Head Captain.

655
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,620
Look!

656
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,600
The Soul Reapers are enveloped.

657
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,110
What's the matter?
There's nothing to worry about.

658
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,440
We're invincible.

659
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:47,900
Maybe we sheared too much?

660
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,070
What?

661
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:53,600
If things stay this way,
Rukia might never remember our names.

662
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,780
Sister!

663
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,450
No!

664
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,810
No matter what, we must make sure that
she doesn't remember what happened that day!

665
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,130
If she does...

666
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,050
you know what will happen, right?

667
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,640
It'll work out.

668
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,640
If we wipe out the Soul Reapers,
Rukia will be with us forever.

669
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,140
Even if she can't remember our names.

670
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,650
Let's go.

671
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,820
How did you get back?

672
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,200
It wasn't that I haven't had the means.

673
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,550
I simply chose not to.

674
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,260
What have you come here for?

675
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,730
I see you have a crisis here.

676
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,580
We have no need for traitors!

677
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,610
Not so fast, Soi Fon.

678
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,700
Lady Yoruichi!

679
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,410
Haven't you all forgotten
something important?

680
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,140
And what do you suppose this
important thing is?

681
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,620
Lately, I've been having trouble
sleeping from all this commotion.

682
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,580
I do hope you could enlighten us.

683
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,790
What is it that you know?

684
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,250
The root of all evil.

685
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,030
The root of all evil?

686
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,220
Yes, but before I go there...

687
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,200
Kurosaki.

688
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,250
As I suspected, Kurotsuchi and Rukia's memories
were both sheared by the same enemy.

689
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,580
The same...?

690
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,190
You mean the two with the huge sickle?!

691
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,250
So you've met them?

692
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,150
Then you'd better hurry.

693
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,220
Go after them and let us take care
of things here.

694
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,110
What?!

695
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,240
Rukia is in grave danger.

696
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,220
Got it!

697
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,050
Let's go, Renji!

698
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,210
I told you not to act so friendly!

699
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,420
Stop!

700
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,060
I'm sure you're all starting to feel it too.

701
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,590
An unexplainable feeling that something
wasn't right...

702
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,550
A feeling that you had forgotten something.

703
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,570
A sense of uneasiness...

704
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,970
That's why even during a crisis
in the Seireitei,

705
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:07,540
you came all the way out here
for a mere intruder.

706
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,690
Isn't that right, Head Captain?

707
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,630
Tell me something.

708
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,390
Huh?

709
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,260
What exactly are you trying to do?

710
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,270
I'm going to find Rukia!

711
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,930
So, who is this person?

712
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,230
She's Rukia!

713
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,170
You still don't remember?!

714
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,510
You were the closest to her!
You two go way back!

715
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,130
I... was?

716
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,660
I can't help it because I don't remember.

717
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,660
Water for sale!

718
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,160
Don't say, "You can't help it"!

719
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,160
Delicious water.

720
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,350
I'll make it cheap.

721
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,810
What's the matter, Renji?

722
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,810
Would you like some pure water?

723
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,960
<i>Gimme back my water! I'll kill you!</i>

724
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:58,800
<i>This way!</i>

725
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,800
Rukia...

726
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,860
That's right! Rukia!

727
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,010
Call out her name! One,
or two hundred times until you remember!

728
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,990
I have a question.

729
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:32,670
Why are you willing to do all this to save her...
this Rukia?

730
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,460
Rukia...

731
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,510
She's someone who changed my world.

732
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,910
She shared her Soul Reaper powers with me

733
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,100
when my family and
I were on the verge of death.

734
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,170
Thanks to her...

735
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,440
I'm standing here today!

736
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,040
What are you saying happened to us?

737
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,140
Simply put, a portion of our memory
has been erased.

738
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,570
Let me explain in sequence.

739
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,920
Shortly after I established the
Department of Research and Development,

740
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,470
I was conducting a study of a certain Hollow.

741
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,560
It lived parasitically on souls
and took over its consciousness.

742
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,730
When its host became debilitated,
it moved on to another.

743
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:43,400
What was particularly unusual was its ability to use its
sickle-shaped tentacle to shear its host's memory.

744
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:51,750
Now if this parasite sheared off all of Rukia Kuchiki's
memories from her life as a Soul Reaper,

745
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,270
what do you think might happen?

746
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,860
No.
That's not possible.

747
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:02,380
The best it could hope to do was attach
to souls with weak Spirit Energy and

748
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,280
erase its host's memory for only
a short period of time.

749
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,100
I don't believe it could shear away enough
memory to erase an individual's existence.

750
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,830
However...

751
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,040
You're suggesting a separate power
joined with it?

752
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,940
In all probability...

753
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,400
Memories are connected with each other.

754
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
You could call them "bonds."

755
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,010
In other words, if one person's
memories are completely sheared away,

756
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,290
at the same time, every past event
related to that individual

757
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,230
will disappear from the memories
of the people around them.

758
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,630
This time, however,
there was one exception.

759
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,690
You mean that Kurosaki fellow?

760
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:46,090
Yes. Kurosaki's Soul Reaper powers
originally belonged to Rukia Kuchiki.

761
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,160
That is why we had forgotten about him as well.

762
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,470
A transfer of Soul Reaper powers?

763
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,370
That is a class one capital offense.

764
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,190
Yes, that's right.

765
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:03,150
However, we owe him enough of a debt of
gratitude that we can accept that offense.

766
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,650
Of all the people we shouldn't forget,
we forgot about him.

767
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,540
The truth is, I've forgotten about him too.

768
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:17,810
Fortunately, I had kept a log,
so it didn't get out of hand.

769
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:22,170
Just a minute.
How do you explain Kurotsuchi?

770
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,010
We still have memories of him.

771
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,360
Exactly.
That's just what was puzzling me.

772
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,180
But, as you are aware,
Kurotsuchi is an odd fellow.

773
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,730
I wondered if perhaps he did something to himself?

774
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:41,090
With that in mind, I did some checking,
and just as I suspected...

775
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,360
Kurotsuchi regularly made backups of his memories.

776
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:58,370
Anyway, because of that,
all of you remembered him.

777
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,040
Let me repeat.

778
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,550
All memories are connected.

779
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,540
Well, Kon?
Were you able to tell where Rukia is?

780
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,020
It's no use.
The Seireitei is too big.

781
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,750
But I could tell that she passed
through here a short while ago.

782
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,860
Damn it. What should we do? We're out of clues.

783
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,570
Hey!

784
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,320
Huh?

785
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,720
Didn't you say that you received your
Soul Reaper powers from that Rukia person?

786
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,580
Yeah. I did.

787
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,950
Then your spiritual composition might be similar.

788
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:38,910
Huh?

789
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,580
I'm saying we might be able to trace her Spirit Ribbon!

790
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,940
Spirit Ribbon? Isn't that impossible here?

791
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:50,970
Yeah. You're right that visualizing it here in the Soul Society
where things are comprised of Reishi is normally impossible!

792
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:56,410
But since you possess a similar spiritual composition,
you might be able to trace Rukia's remnant Spirit Ribbon.

793
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:01,230
I'm not very good at this sort of Kido,
but I'll help you, so give it a try!

794
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,440
There's no harm in trying, right?

795
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,880
Are you kidding me?!
I'll put every effort into this!

796
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,900
Rukia and I... are connected!

797
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,840
I'll find out where she is, no matter what!

798
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,060
Okay then, let's do it!

799
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:17,520
You bet!

800
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:13,670
Does it work?

801
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:21,520
We did it!

802
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,530
Wait!

803
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,940
Rukia!

804
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:39,530
I'm so glad you're okay.
Does your head still hurt?

805
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,270
What is this place?

806
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,870
This is... uh...

807
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,040
We're going to chase away the Soul Reapers
who've been making you suffer!

808
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,440
Chase away the Soul Reapers?!

809
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,410
So you two used this device to...

810
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,010
You mustn't!

811
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:02,270
Have you considered how much
destruction this device will cause?

812
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,430
It might destroy the Seireitei.

813
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,770
Good!

814
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:08,380
Why are you standing up for the Soul Reapers?!

815
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:13,400
The Soul Reapers will come to take
you away from us again!

816
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,550
I... I... don't want to be separated
from you anymore!

817
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,530
What're you talking about?

818
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,740
I'll be with both of you forever!

819
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,310
I'm not lying. Trust me.

820
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,250
No!

821
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,090
Absolutely not!

822
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,270
We have to get rid of them!

823
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,230
Why is that?

824
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,090
Because... Because Rukia, you're...

825
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,780
What's that?

826
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,340
Don't know what it is,
but it seems to have started!

827
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,500
Rukia!

828
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:13,940
Hey!

829
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:24,370
Leave this one to me!

830
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:24,740
Hey!

831
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,060
Roar! Zabimaru!

832
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,420
Renji!

833
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,320
I said to let me take care of this!

834
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,650
Bankai!

835
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,090
Hihio! Zabimaru!

836
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,340
You... used your Bankai...

837
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,120
Hey, watch it! You almost got me!

838
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,830
Shut up already!

839
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,190
How's that?

840
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,630
Zabimaru can be used like this too!

841
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:22,860
I know!

842
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:23,530
Huh?

843
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,100
Never mind. Go!

844
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,400
Bankai!

845
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,810
Tensa Zangetsu!

846
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,190
Rukia.

847
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,150
I'm okay.

848
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,340
What's wrong?!

849
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,570
I hate Soul Reapers!

850
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,250
Soul Reapers are...

851
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,940
What?!

852
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,980
Rukia, I've come for you!

853
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,320
Sis.

854
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,210
That's Rukia?

855
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,370
Renji...

856
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:56,120
Go back!

857
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,580
Go back, Soul Reapers!

858
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,980
Rukia doesn't know you!

859
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,000
That's not how it goes.

860
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,440
Rukia is our friend!

861
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,800
Rukia doesn't want that!

862
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,430
Rukia is not like you anymore!

863
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,600
Try to remember, Rukia.

864
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,870
The Rukia I know wouldn't give
up being a Soul Reaper!

865
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:22,130
You put your life at risk to save me,
a person you only just met.

866
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:27,800
You shared your powers with me so that
I could protect my family.

867
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,980
You're that kind of strong person!

868
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:39,900
Rukia!

869
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,670
I...

870
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:43,880
No!

871
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,840
No, Rukia! Don't look that way!

872
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,320
No! No, Rukia.

873
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,510
You mustn't go back to the Soul Reapers.

874
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,180
Go back to the Soul Reapers...

875
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,330
So I was a Soul Reaper?

876
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:11,220
Soul Reaper. Tell me your name once more.

877
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,540
It's Ichigo Kurosaki.

878
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,680
I'm the great Kon!

879
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,060
Kurosaki...

880
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,670
Ichigo...

881
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,880
No!

882
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,160
Hey...

883
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,680
Rukia!

884
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,060
Don't move!

885
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:58,480
You!

886
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,000
We won't let you have Rukia.

887
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,830
Sister...

888
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,810
We'll never let you have her.

889
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,790
We'd rather...

890
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,750
What's with her?

891
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,710
We will become one with Rukia.

892
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:31,680
Then Rukia will disappear. Is that what you want?

893
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:36,600
All right.

894
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,950
We'll be together forever.

895
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,440
Rukia...

896
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:49,800
Rukia!

897
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:49,800
Rukia!

898
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,510
Rukia!

899
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:56,070
Sis!

900
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:05,960
Rukia!

901
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,170
Disappear... all of you...

902
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,190
Disappear!

903
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:40,560
So this is the root of the evil
that messed up the Seireitei.

904
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,890
We're going to stop them, Renji.

905
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,040
You do something about that woman!

906
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,250
Isn't that what you came here for?!

907
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:52,690
They're yours.

908
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,260
Rukia!

909
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,200
Sis!

910
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,460
Kon!

911
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:24,390
Rukia...

912
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,260
Evacuate! Now!

913
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,170
Lieutenant Hisagi, Lieutenant Matsumoto,
look up there!

914
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,190
What the–?! What is that thing?

915
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,520
Rukia!

916
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,270
<i>Shear him away.</i>

917
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,810
<i>Yes, shear him away.</i>

918
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,720
Stop!

919
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:23,140
Rukia! PIease! Snap out of it!

920
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,450
It's me, Ichigo!

921
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,370
Try to remember, Rukia!

922
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,080
It's no use. At this rate,
it'll swallow up the Seireitei!

923
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,680
Matsumoto!

924
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,040
Captain!

925
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,710
Are you okay, Matsumoto?

926
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,370
Yes.

927
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,010
What is that thing?

928
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:03,820
Not sure, but it looks like it means business.

929
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,060
From what Kurotsuchi tells us,

930
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:14,750
the enemy should have the control lock for the
Reishi convergence device that he created.

931
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,210
This terrible state of affairs resulted from
that device functioning out of control.

932
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:24,180
At this point, the only way to stop
it is to destroy the device.

933
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,660
But I don't think that thing's going
to just let us walk in there.

934
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,410
Kurosaki and the others are already inside.

935
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:37,060
We need to keep the Reishi from
spreading any further.

936
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,590
He makes it sound so simple.

937
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,280
He's always been like that.

938
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,430
All things in the universe turn to ashes!
Ryujinjakka!

939
01:09:58,230 --> 01:09:59,790
Way to go, Old Man Yama!

940
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:04,760
I'm ordering all captains to stop
the wild spread of Reishi!

941
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,610
Yes, sir!

942
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,610
Yes, sir!

943
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,790
All waves rise now and become my shield!

944
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,650
Lightning, strike now and become my blade!

945
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,630
Sogyonokotowari!

946
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:25,530
Flower wind rage and flower god roar!

947
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,740
Heavenly wind rage and heavenly demon sneer!

948
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,140
Katenkyokotsu!

949
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,030
Let's go, Soi Fon!

950
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:52,740
Yes, ma'am!

951
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,330
Shunko!

952
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,420
Oh no!

953
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,190
Soi Fon!

954
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:26,970
Scream...

955
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,110
Benihime!

956
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,020
Lady Yoruichi...

957
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,880
Forgive me, Lady Yoruichi.

958
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:50,720
It's okay. It's okay.

959
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,430
Let's go.

960
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,050
Yes, ma'am!

961
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,600
Follow my lead!

962
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,310
Yes, sir!

963
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,310
Yes, sir!

964
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,810
Hyorinmaru!

965
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,650
Growl, Haineko!

966
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,600
Reap, Kazeshini!

967
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,140
Yumichika!

968
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,760
Matsumoto! Hisagi!

969
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,330
What is this hard thing?

970
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:47,770
Hey, this is...

971
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,290
Captain!

972
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,310
Are you the bastard who messed around
with my head?!

973
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:30,400
Morning, Kenny!

974
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:34,090
Hold on, Yachiru!

975
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,740
Aye-aye, sir!

976
01:13:57,050 --> 01:14:00,290
Damn it! If I could just destroy
this thing...

977
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,060
Stop it!

978
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:02,770
Rukia!

979
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:15,860
That man... I will shear away his memories.

980
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,700
Once that's done, no one will remember Rukia.

981
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,940
Right. We will be the only ones dear to Rukia.

982
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:31,840
Morons! Memories aren't everything.

983
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,840
Renji's soul remembered me!

984
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,930
Rukia will, too.

985
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:40,660
You can't take away our bonds!

986
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:45,730
Rukia!

987
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,060
Damn it!

988
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,740
Rukia...

989
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,720
Kisuke!

990
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,800
It's not going well. They're too big.

991
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,210
We're not going to make any progress until
we destroy the device in the lab tower.

992
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:30,690
But we can't get to the lab tower
with this in our way.

993
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:32,790
What is that?

994
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,420
Don't fall behind, Yumichika!

995
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,150
Zaraki? So he's back!

996
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,950
Now's our chance, everyone.

997
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,280
It'll be difficult, but we have to avoid
that creature and get to the lab tower!

998
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,120
Scatter...

999
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,120
Senbonzakura.

1000
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,960
Kuchiki.

1001
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,900
Nice moves, Byakuya-boy.

1002
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,860
I'm going in ahead.

1003
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,070
We're counting on you, Captain Kuchiki!

1004
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,720
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

1005
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,540
Thank you, Captain Hitsugaya!

1006
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,240
Don't mention it. Let's go!

1007
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,980
Ryusenka!

1008
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,450
Well then, I think I'll get serious as well.

1009
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,520
Kirisaki Benihime!

1010
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,010
Look out behind you, Ichigo!

1011
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:14,620
Bakudo 61: Rikujokoro!

1012
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,210
Captain!

1013
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,660
Byakuya!

1014
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,630
Who are you?!

1015
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,240
Byakuya?!

1016
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,790
If what you say is true,

1017
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,830
then all the more reason
I must resolve this situation.

1018
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:03,110
Wait!

1019
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:06,050
Rukia is still in there!

1020
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:09,080
No matter what happens, we're still connected!

1021
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:14,500
Rukia! Isn't that right, Rukia?!

1022
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:26,320
Her Spiritual Pressure is
turning into that of a Hollow's!

1023
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,840
It's too late.

1024
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,280
Damn it.

1025
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,810
Sis...

1026
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,670
Kon!

1027
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:44,690
Please... Please save Sis.

1028
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,380
Please save her.

1029
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,970
<i>Do you want to save your family?</i>

1030
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,100
<i>Of course.</i>

1031
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,330
<i>Is there a way?!</i>

1032
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,840
<i>There is one way.</i>

1033
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:04,050
<i>You must become a Soul Reaper!</i>

1034
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,470
<i>I don't know if it is possible.</i>

1035
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:12,430
<i>But if it isn't, the two of us
will both perish.</i>

1036
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:27,220
She sacrificed herself to save me
and my family.

1037
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,510
She took a chance on me.

1038
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,700
That's why I will never give up.

1039
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,020
Do as you wish.

1040
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:59,690
Shear him! Kill the Soul Reaper!

1041
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,710
Here it goes, Rukia.

1042
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,650
This time I'm sharing my powers with you.

1043
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,580
Wake up, Rukia!

1044
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:21,870
<i>I'm...</i>

1045
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:25,060
<i>Ichigo... Kurosaki!</i>

1046
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:34,470
Rukia...

1047
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,430
What is he doing?!

1048
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:19,600
Bankai...

1049
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,450
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi!

1050
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,630
Hikotsu Taiho!

1051
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:56,180
Looks like we managed somehow.

1052
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,190
Ichigo...

1053
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:11,650
Hey.

1054
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,480
Ichigo...

1055
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,520
Go to them.

1056
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:31,020
You two!

1057
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,820
Rukia? Is that you, Rukia?

1058
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,220
Yes, it's me.

1059
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:40,990
We were punished, weren't we?

1060
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:44,500
Because we didn't listen to you.

1061
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:49,190
Rukia, please don't hate my sister.

1062
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,220
<i>Help me, Rukia!</i>

1063
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,200
<i>Where are you?</i>

1064
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,200
<i>Rukia!</i>

1065
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,530
<i>Rukia!</i>

1066
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,600
<i>Rukia!</i>

1067
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,670
<i>A Soul Reaper?!</i>

1068
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:09,120
<i>Stop it!</i>

1069
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,800
<i>You two!</i>

1070
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,450
<i>Rukia!</i>

1071
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,450
<i>Rukia!</i>

1072
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,740
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1073
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:21,760
<i>Rukia! Behind you!</i>

1074
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,290
<i>That was amazing, Rukia!</i>

1075
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:32,820
<i>Wait!</i>

1076
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,420
<i>What is that guy?!</i>

1077
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:39,090
<i>I want... your Spirit Energy.</i>

1078
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:42,240
<i>This body is useless now.</i>

1079
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,260
<i>Run!</i>

1080
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,610
<i>You're not a Soul Reaper! Monster!</i>

1081
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,720
<i>Rukia!</i>

1082
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:12,040
<i>Get away from Rukia, Soul Reaper!</i>

1083
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:15,610
<i>You're in my way!</i>

1084
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,910
<i>Sister!</i>

1085
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,230
Yes, I remember now.

1086
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:44,950
But when I came to, the two of you were gone,
and I forgot about it.

1087
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:49,390
That's because that Hollow sheared your memory.

1088
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:56,360
And also because the siblings possessed a
special ability to perform teleportation.

1089
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,550
In all likelihood, moments before they died,

1090
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:04,280
they placed that Hollow into their
own bodies in order to protect you.

1091
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:11,250
After unknowingly becoming parasitically attached
to a dead body, the Hollow rushed back to Hueco Mundo.

1092
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:15,850
However,
the two took over the Hollow instead.

1093
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:23,680
And it was their overwhelming desire
to see you again that brought them back.

1094
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:27,640
Do you remember now?

1095
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,370
I'm sorry we lied to you.

1096
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:36,610
You see, our lives ended at that time.

1097
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:41,570
It hasn't ended. Death is not an end.

1098
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,680
You came back, didn't you?

1099
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:50,540
I was happy. I was so happy!

1100
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:54,520
I wanted to see you again, Rukia.

1101
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,960
You're the only person we had.

1102
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,230
You're not alone.

1103
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:06,970
You each had the most important person
right next to you the whole time.

1104
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:13,930
I remembered your names.

1105
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,250
Homura. And Shizuku.

1106
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:21,400
Together, it means the two of you shine brightly.

1107
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:23,760
Homura...

1108
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,360
Shizuku...

1109
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,930
<i>Yay!</i>

1110
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,930
<i>Yay!</i>

1111
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:28,820
<i>Names!</i>

1112
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:28,840
They're nice names.

1113
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:34,600
That's what we wanted to hear.

1114
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,600
I'm so happy.

1115
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,980
Shizuku.

1116
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,750
Homura.

1117
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,800
Thank you.

1118
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:50,370
Goodbye, Rukia.

1119
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,640
Homura! Shizuku!

1120
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,330
Don't go!

1121
01:26:58,330 --> 01:26:59,610
No... No!

1122
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,380
Homura! Shizuku!

1123
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:07,530
Answer me, please!

1124
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,360
<i>Pretty good, don't you think?</i>

1125
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,010
<i>I mimicked the style of the
drawings you used to do for us.</i>

1126
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:55,310
Ichigo, are you going back?

1127
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:55,930
Yeah.

1128
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:00,690
You saved me once again.

1129
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:03,110
You were the one who originally saved me.

1130
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:09,970
You know, if death isn't really an end,

1131
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:14,030
then that time we met might not have been the first.

1132
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:18,620
We might have been connected from long before that.

1133
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:25,940
I'm not really sure, but I think maybe once
a bond is formed, it never disappears.

1134
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:29,260
If that's the case, even if we forget everything,

1135
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,050
we'll be connected again somewhere in the future.

1136
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,220
That'll be true for you, and those siblings as well.

1137
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,120
Yes.

1138
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:44,270
Well, I'll be heading back, Soul Reaper.

1139
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:46,090
Don't call me Soul Reaper.

1140
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,400
I'm Rukia Kuchiki.
