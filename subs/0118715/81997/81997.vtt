FOR A HIGH PRIEST IN JERUSALEM
IN THE SECOND CENTURY,

477
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,994
THE QUESTION WAS QUITE SIMPLE:
DO I JUMP ON THE GREEK BANDWAGON
OR NOT?

478
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:12,083
DO I REMAIN SEPARATE,
OR DO I THROW MY LOT IN
WITH A SOCIAL PROCESS...

TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP...

WITH THE LOT OF ANTIOCHUS IV,

482
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:29,066
THIS WOULD CREATE A REACTION,
A VIOLENT REACTION,

483
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:34,171
BECAUSE THERE WERE JEWS
WHO CONSIDERED THIS
TO BE NOTHING LESS THAN HERESY.

REACHED SUCH A PITCH...

TO SHOW ANY INTEREST
IN THE SERVICES OF THE ALTAR.

SUCH A THING AS BEING ACCEPTABLE

AND BUILT A NEW ALTAR.

615
00:49:55,108 --> 00:50:00,497
[ Men Chanting ]
THEN, STRIKING FIRE
FROM FLINTS,

616
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:05,369
THEY OFFERED THE FIRST SACRIFICE
FOR TWO YEARS...
[ Sheep Bleating ]

617
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,706
AND BURNED INCENSE
AND LIT THE LAMPS.
[ Man Reciting Prayer ]

618
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:15,679
[ Gafni ] JUDAH MACCABEE
WILL ENTER THE CITY. HE WILL
HAVE TO PURIFY THE TEMPLE...

619
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,265
BECAUSE THE TEMPLE HAD GONE
THROUGH A PROCESS
OF HELLENIZATION.

620
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,851
PAGAN RITES HAD BEEN
INTRODUCED INTO THE TEMPLE,

621
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:25,889
AND JUDAH MACCABEE
WOULD PURIFY,
REDEDICATE THE TEMPLE.

622
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:30,494
THIS, OF COURSE,
LEADING TO THE RENOWNED FESTIVAL
OF HANUKKAH,

623
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,663
THE DEDICATION
OF THE JEWISH TEMPLE ANEW.

624
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:42,839
[ Narrator ] FOR ALL OF
THE PORTRAYAL OF HANUKKAH AS A
TRIUMPHANT MOMENT OF VICTORY...

625
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:49,780
IT WAS,
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE MACCABEES,
NOT WHERE THE STORY ENDED.

626
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:55,419
ANTIOCHUS'S TROOPS
SOON COUNTERATTACKED...

627
00:50:55,419 --> 00:51:00,190
AND DEALT THE REBELS
A CRUSHING BLOW BY
KILLING JUDAH MACCABEE.

628
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,800
[ Man ]
ALL ISRAEL WEPT
AND MOURNED HIM DEEPLY...

629
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:15,872
AND FOR MANY DAYS,
THEY REPEATED THIS DIRGE:

630
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:19,776
"WHAT A DOWNFALL
FOR THE STRONG MAN...

631
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,114
THE MAN WHO KEPT ISRAEL SAFE."

632
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,789
[ Schiffman ] THERE ARE TWO WAYS
OF LOOKING AT THIS QUESTION OF
WHETHER THE MACCABEES WON...

633
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,460
BECAUSE THE SELEUCIDS CAME BACK
AND KICKED THEM OUT.

634
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:41,782
SO APPARENTLY THIS THING
THAT WE CELEBRATE ON HANUKKAH
IS NOT REALLY THE FINAL VICTORY.

635
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:49,239
[ Narrator ]
IN THE TRUE STORY
OF THE MACCABEES,

636
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,809
IT WAS NOT MILITARY MIGHT
THAT ULTIMATELY WON THE DAY,

637
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,379
BUT POLITICS AND NEGOTIATIONS.

638
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:04,454
AFTER JUDAH'S DEATH,
HIS BROTHER JONATHAN TOOK
OVER LEADERSHIP OF THE REBELS.

639
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:11,761
BY 152 B.C.,
JONATHAN HAD 10,000 SOLDIERS
UNDER HIS COMMAND.

640
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,866
BUT INSTEAD
OF STARTING A NEW WAR,

641
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,969
JONATHAN
MADE A BARGAIN WITH ONE
OF TWO GREEK GENERALS...

642
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:24,057
WHO WERE
FIGHTING FOR CONTROL
OF THE SELEUCID EMPIRE.

643
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,277
THERE WERE TWO PRETENDERS
TO THE SELEUCID THRONE...

644
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,946
COMPETING FOR THE RULE
OF SYRIA.

645
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:34,201
JONATHAN SHREWDLY
THREW HIS WEIGHT
AND HIS SOLDIERS...

646
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:37,454
BEHIND THE WEAKER,
GETTING IN RETURN
AN AGREEMENT...

647
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:40,707
THAT HE WOULD BE HIGH PRIEST
AND RULER OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE.

648
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,214
[ Narrator ]
JONATHAN'S BARGAIN
WAS SUCCESSFUL.

649
00:52:47,214 --> 00:52:52,636
JUDEA WAS INDEPENDENT
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE DYNASTY OF KING DAVID.

650
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:59,109
THE REIGN OF THE MACCABEES
BROUGHT A SENSE OF RENEWAL
TO JUDEA.

651
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:05,048
THOSE JEWS WHO LOOKED
TO THEIR DIVINE BOOK
TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD...

652
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,285
DREW PARTICULAR ENCOURAGEMENT.

653
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:13,673
FOR THEM, THE MACCABEES' VICTORY
AGAINST OVERWHELMING ODDS...

654
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:18,545
WAS PROOF OF THE BIBLE'S PROMISE
THAT GOD WOULD COME
TO THE AID...

655
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:22,866
OF THOSE WHO WERE WILLING
TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FAITH.

656
00:53:24,484 --> 00:53:26,653
[ Gafni ]
THE MEANING THAT WAS ATTACHED
TO HANUKKAH WAS OBVIOUS--

657
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,890
THAT IF ONE IS
FIGHTING A RIGHTEOUS WAR,

658
00:53:30,423 --> 00:53:33,143
THE FEW CAN DEFEAT THE MANY,

659
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,829
THE RIGHTEOUS
CAN DEFEAT THE WICKED.

660
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,548
THIS BECOMES A MAINSTAY,
NOT ONLY IN JEWISH TRADITION,
I WOULD SAY,

661
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,166
BUT IN
JUDEO-CHRISTIAN TRADITION,

662
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:45,555
THE IDEA THAT ONE OUGHT
TO BE WILLING TO DIE
FOR ONE'S BELIEF-- MARTYRDOM.

663
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:50,227
AND CLEARLY THE STEADFASTNESS.
I THINK THE WORD
IS ALMOST ZEALOTRY.

664
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,396
IN FACT, THE BOOK OF MACCABEE
ALMOST PLAYS ON THIS IDEA,

665
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,650
THAT ONE SHOULD BE ZEALOUS
FOR THE LAW AND GOD COMES
TO THE AID...

666
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,818
OF THOSE WHO ARE ZEALOUS
FOR THE LAW.

667
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,792
[ Narrator ]
THIS CONVICTION THAT THE FATE
OF THE JEWS DEPENDED...

668
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:09,462
ON DEFENDING GOD'S LAWS
AT ALL COSTS...

669
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:13,250
WOULD ONLY GROW
IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

670
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,920
AND IT WOULD SET THE STAGE
FOR A TRUE CATACLYSM...

671
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,708
WHEN ANOTHER GREAT EMPIRE
ARRIVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST:

672
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,311
THE ROMANS.
