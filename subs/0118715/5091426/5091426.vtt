00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.211
<i>Way out west there was this fella-</i>

2
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.879
<i>Fella I wanna tell you about.</i>

3
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.383
<i>Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.</i>

4
00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:53.095
<i>Least that was the handle
that his Loving parents gave him.</i>

5
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.306
<i>But he never had
much use for it himself.</i>

6
00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:00.394
<i>This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.</i>

7
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.521
<i>Now, Dude-</i>

8
00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:06.316
<i>That's a name no one would self-apply
where I come from.</i>

9
00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:11.780
<i>But then there was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,</i>

10
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.782
<i>and a lot about where he lived
likewise.</i>

11
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.787
<i>But then again,</i>

12
00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.790
<i>maybe that's why I found the place
so damn interesting.</i>

13
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.716
<i>They call Los Angeles
the city of angels.</i>

14
00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:33.802
<i>I didn't find it to be that, exactly.</i>

15
00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:36.889
<i>But I'll allow as there are
some nice folks there.</i>

16
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.309
<i>Course, I can't say I seen London,</i>

17
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.895
<i>and I never been to France,</i>

18
00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:47.816
<i>and I ain't never seen no queen
in her damned undies, as the fella says.</i>

19
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.818
<i>But I'll tell you what-</i>

20
00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.987
<i>after seeing Los Angeles...</i>

21
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.115
<i>and this here story
I'm about to unfold,</i>

22
00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:58.118
<i>well, I guess I've seen something...</i>

23
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:02.497
<i>every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of those other places.</i>

24
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.708
<i>And in English too.</i>

25
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.711
<i>So I can die
with a smile on my face...</i>

26
00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.506
<i>without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.</i>

27
00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:16.303
<i>Now, this here story I'm about to unfold
took place back in the early '903,</i>

28
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:21.517
<i>just about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.</i>

29
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.312
<i>I only mention it
'cause sometimes there's a man-</i>

30
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.314
<i>I won't say "hero."</i>

31
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.399
<i>'Cause what's a hero?</i>

32
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.902
<i>But sometimes there's a man-</i>

33
00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:34.988
<i>And I'm talking about the Dude here.</i>

34
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.699
<i>Sometimes there's a man-</i>

35
00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:42.412
<i>Well, he's the man
for his time and place.</i>

36
00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.082
<i>He fits right in there.</i>

37
00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:47.084
<i>And that's the Dude...</i>

38
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.711
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

39
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:52.506
<i>And even if he is a lazy man-</i>

40
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.092
<i>and the Dude was most certainly that-</i>

41
00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:59.096
<i>quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,</i>

42
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:03.016
<i>which would place him high
in the running for laziest worldwide.</i>

43
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.895
<i>But sometimes there's a man-</i>

44
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.897
<i>Sometimes...</i>

45
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.191
<i>there's a man-</i>

46
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.987
<i>Well, I-
I lost my train of thought here.</i>

47
00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:17.781
<i>But-Aw, hell.</i>

48
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.200
<i>I done introduced him enough.</i>

49
00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:22.411
<i>With them all for a collective action.</i>

50
00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.705
<i>This will not stand.
This will not stand-</i>

51
00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:27.416
this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.

52
00:03:57.613 --> 00:03:59.489
Where's the money, Lebowski?

53
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.409
I want that money, Lebowski.

54
00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.995
Bunny says you're good for it.

55
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.497
Where's the money, Lebowski?

56
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:10.209
Where's the money, Lebowski?

57
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.211
Where's the fucking money,
shithead?

58
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.214
<i>Uh, it's, uh- Oh- Uh-</i>

59
00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.799
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

60
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.802
Don't fuck with us.

61
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.307
<i>Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehom,</i>

62
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.393
<i>that means you owe money
to Jackie Treehom.</i>

63
00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.395
Ever thus to deadbeats,
Lebowski.

64
00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.898
N-No, don't do Th-

65
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.319
<i>- Not on the rug, man.
- See?</i>

66
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.614
See what happens, Labowski?
You see what happens?

67
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.492
<i>Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong guy.</i>

68
00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:45.494
I'm the Dude, man.

69
00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:49.790
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.
Your wife is Bunny.

70
00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.585
M-My w- <i>My wife?</i> Bunny?

71
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:58.090
Do you see a wedding ring on my finger? Does
this place look like I'm fucking married?

72
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.092
The toilet seat's up. man!

73
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.018
What the fuck is this?

74
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.313
Obviously you're not a golfer.

75
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.317
- Woo?
- Yeah?

76
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.987
<i>Isn't this guy
supposed to be a millionaire?</i>

77
00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.906
<i>Fuck.</i>

78
00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.784
Yeah.
What do you think?

79
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.619
He looks like a fucking loser.

80
00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:30.497
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

81
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.499
Fucking time-waster.

82
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.585
Thanks a lot, asshole.

83
00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:44.089
<i>Hod!</i>

84
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.592
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

85
00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:49.595
<i>I'm telling you,
this was a valued mg.</i>

86
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.597
This was a-

87
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.100
Yeah. man. It really tied the room
together. This was a valued, uh-

88
00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:57.102
What tied the room together, Dude?
My rug.

89
00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:00.105
Were you listening to the
Dude's story, Donny? What?

90
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:02.482
Walter- Were you listening
to the Dude's story?

91
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:05.485
I was bowling. So you have no
frame of reference here, Donny.

92
00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:08.488
You're like a child who wanders into the
middle of a movie and wants to know-

93
00:08:08.614 --> 00:08:11.992
Walter, what's the point, man? There's
no reason- Here's my point, Dude.

94
00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.494
There's no fucking reason why these
two- Yeah, Walter, what's your point?

95
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.997
Huh?
Walter, what is the poi-

96
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.499
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

97
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:22.002
What the fuck are you
talking about? Huh?

98
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.796
No, what the fuck are you-
I'm not-

99
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.382
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here, Dude.

100
00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.384
What the fuck is he talking about?
My rug.

101
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.887
Forget it, Donny!
You're out of your element!

102
00:08:31.887 --> 00:08:35.390
Walter, the Chinaman who peed on my
rug, I can't 90 give him a bill!

103
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.392
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

104
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.896
What the fuck are you talking about?
The Chinaman is not the issue here, Dude!

105
00:08:40.896 --> 00:08:43.899
I'm talking about
drawing a line in the sand, Dude.

106
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.109
Across this line <i>you do not-</i>

107
00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:50.197
Also, Dude, "Chinaman'
is not the preferred nomenclature.

108
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.199
Asian-American, please.

109
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:55.202
Walter, this isn't a guy who built
the railroads here. This is a guy-

110
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.204
What the fuck are you ta-

111
00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:00.207
Walter, he peed on my rug!
He peed on the Dude's rug.

112
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.209
Donny,
you're out of your element!

113
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:05.212
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

114
00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.214
<i>So, who- who-</i>

115
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:11.510
Jeff Lebowski. The other Jeffrey Lebowski.
The millionaire.

116
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.012
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

117
00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:17.683
<i>Plus, he has the wealth,
obviously, and the resources,</i>

118
00:09:17.683 --> 00:09:19.685
uh, so that there's no reason-

119
00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:23.188
there's <i>no filcking</i> reason why his wife
should go out and owe money all over town,

120
00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:26.191
and then they come
and they pee on your fucking rug!

121
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.193
Am I wrong? Am I wrong? No.

122
00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.196
Yeah, but-
<i>Okay than.</i>

123
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.907
That rug really
tied the room together.

124
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:35.909
- Did it not?
- Fucking-A.

125
00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:37.911
And this guy peed on it.
Donny. Please.

126
00:09:37.995 --> 00:09:40.497
<i>You know,
this is the fucking guy-</i>

127
00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:43.208
I could find this fucking Lebowski guy.
His <i>name</i> is <i>Lebowski?</i>

128
00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:45.085
That's your name, Dude.

129
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.880
<i>This is the guy who shame
compensate me for the New? rug.</i>

130
00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:52.509
His wife goes out and owes money all
over town, and they pee on my rug?

131
00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.386
They pee on your fucking rug?

132
00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.097
Peed on my fucking rug.
<i>That's right, Dude.</i>

133
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.518
They peed on your fucking rug.

134
00:10:03.187 --> 00:10:04.396
This is his study.

135
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.899
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards,

136
00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:10.611
Jeffrey Lebowski. Hmm. citations,
honorary degrees, et cetera

137
00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:14.198
<i>Mmm.</i> Very impressive. Oh, please
feel free to inspect them.

138
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.201
Mmm? Oh. No, I'm not, uh,
really, uh- Oh, please. Please.

139
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.703
That is the key
to the city of Pasadena,

140
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:24.917
which Mr. Lebowski received two years ago
in recognition of his various civic, uh-

141
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.380
Oh! That's the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award, which is given-

142
00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:32.382
on, not necessarily
given every year.

143
00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:34.885
Hey, is this, uh- Is this- Given
only when there's a worthy somebody-

144
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.514
Is this him with, uh, Nancy? Yes, indeed, that
is Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes.

145
00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:40.516
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan-

146
00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:43.018
That's, uh, Lebowski
on the left there?

147
00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:45.020
Of course.
Mr. Lebowski, on the left-

148
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.815
So he's a crip- Uh, you know, a, uh,
uh, handicapped kind of guy? Uh-

149
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.901
Mr. Lebowski
<i>is disabled,</i> yes.

150
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:55.906
Uh, this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan
was first lady of the nation. Yes, yes.

151
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.908
Not of California.
Good shot.

152
00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.410
In fact, he met privately
with the president,

153
00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:03.413
though, unfortunately, there wasn't
enough time for a photo opportunity.

154
00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:06.500
Oh, well, Nancy's pretty good. 0h,
wonderful woman. We were very happy to-

155
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.502
These are, uh-
Oh.

156
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:12.214
Those are Mr. Lebowski's children,
so to speak. Different mothers, huh?

157
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.217
No, they're not-
So, racially, he's pretty cool?

158
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.886
They're not literally
his children.

159
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.888
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

160
00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:23.100
inner city children of promise,
but without the necessary means for-

161
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.102
necessary means
for a higher education,

162
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.605
so Mr. Lebowski is committed
to sending all of them to college.

163
00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:30.816
Excuse me. Thank you.
Oh, geez.

164
00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.818
Thank you.

165
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.696
Far out. Think he's got
room for one more? One, uh-

166
00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.698
Oh!

167
00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.701
You never went to college-
Please don't touch that.

168
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.912
Oh, yeah, I did,
but I spent most of my time, uh,

169
00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:46.582
occupying various
administration buildings,

170
00:11:46.707 --> 00:11:48.584
Mm-hmm.
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

171
00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:51.587
breaking into the R.0.T.C.
and bowling.

172
00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:54.590
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

173
00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:56.717
<i>Oh.</i>

174
00:11:57.718 --> 00:11:59.511
Hmm.

175
00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:03.515
Okay, sir.
You're a Lebowski, I'm a Lebowski.

176
00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:06.185
<i>That's terrific.</i>

177
00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:09.104
But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

178
00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:11.106
What can I do for you, sir?

179
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.693
Uh, well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

180
00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.695
It really tied the room together.

181
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.698
<i>You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.</i>

182
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.700
<i>Where do I fit in?</i>

183
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.995
Well, uh, they were- they were
looking for you, these two guys.

184
00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:27.289
<i>Uh, you know, they-</i>
I'll <i>say it</i> again.

185
00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:30.292
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

186
00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:32.294
I know what happened.
Yes? Yes?

187
00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:35.881
Oh, so you know that they were
trying to piss <i>on your</i> rug.

188
00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.509
Did urinate on your rug?

189
00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:42.596
You mean, did you personally come and pee on
my rug? <i>Hello!</i> Do you speak <i>English, sir?</i>

190
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.598
<i>TParla usted ingliis?</i>

191
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.518
I'll ask you again:
Did I urinate on your rug?

192
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.604
No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

193
00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:52.898
<i>I just want to
understand this, sir.</i>

194
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:58.403
<i>Every time a rug is micturated upon in this
fair city, I have to compensate the person?</i>

195
00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:02.115
Come on, man.
I'm not trying to scam anybody here.

196
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.284
Uh, you know, I'm just, uh-

197
00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:07.287
You're just looking for a handout
like every other-

198
00:13:08.497 --> 00:13:10.707
Are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?

199
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.710
Uh, w-wait. Let me-
Let me explain something to you.

200
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.213
Uh, I am not Mr. Lebowski.

201
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:19.216
<i>You're</i> Mr. Lebowski.
I'm the Dude.

202
00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:21.218
So that's what you call me.
You know?

203
00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:24.513
Uh, that, or, uh, His Dudeness,

204
00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.015
<i>or, uh, Duder,
or, uh, you know,</i>

205
00:13:27.099 --> 00:13:30.102
El Duderino, if you're not
into the whole brevity thing.

206
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.104
Are you employedsir?

207
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.607
Employed?

208
00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:39.695
You don't go out looking for a job
dressed like that, do you? On a weekday?

209
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.697
Is this a-

210
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.700
What <i>day is</i> this?
<i>Well, Idavork, sir.</i>

211
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.702
<i>So, if you don't mind-</i>

212
00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:49.288
No, Ho mind.
Uh, the Dude minds.

213
00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:51.290
This will not stand, you know.

214
00:13:51.415 --> 00:13:53.292
This aggression
will not stand, man.

215
00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:55.711
I mean, your wife owes money-

216
00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:58.505
My wife is not the issue here!

217
00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:03.510
<i>I hope that someday my wife will learn to
live on her allowance, which is ample.</i>

218
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.890
But if she does not, that is her problem,
not mine, just as the rug isyour problem.

219
00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:12.311
<i>Just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,</i>

220
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.980
<i>regardless of who
he chooses to blame.</i>

221
00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:18.192
<i>I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.</i>

222
00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:20.694
Some Chinaman
took them from me in Korea.

223
00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.197
But I went out and achieved anyway.

224
00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:28.493
I cannot solve your problems, sir.
Only you can.

225
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.206
Well, fuck <i>it. Oh! "Fuck it."</i>

226
00:14:32.289 --> 00:14:36.710
Yes, that's your answer. That's your answer
to everything. Tattoo it on your forehead!

227
00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.713
Your revolution is over,
Mr. Lebowski!

228
00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.799
Condolences!
The bums lost!

229
00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:47.679
<i>My advice to you is to do what
your parents did- get a job, sir!</i>

230
00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:50.807
The bums
will always lose!

231
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.809
Do you hear me, Lebowski?

232
00:14:52.893 --> 00:14:55.521
<i>The bums will always lose!</i>

233
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.690
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

234
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.692
Okay.

235
00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:03.195
The old man told me
to take any rug in the house.

236
00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:05.280
Well, enjoy.

237
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.492
And perhaps we'll see you again
sometime, Dude. Yeah, sure.

238
00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:12.287
<i>Uh, if I'm in the neighborhood,
you know, and, uh,</i>

239
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.582
I need to use the john.

240
00:15:25.217 --> 00:15:27.511
Blow on them.

241
00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.179
Huh?

242
00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:31.306
<i>Go ahead. Blow.</i>

243
00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:36.186
You want me to blow
on your, uh, toes?

244
00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:37.813
Uh-huh.

245
00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:39.815
I can't blow that far.

246
00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:48.115
Are you sure he won't mind?

247
00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:51.910
<i>UIi doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.</i>

248
00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:54.580
Oh.
That must be exhausting.

249
00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:56.498
You're not blowing.

250
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.501
Our guest has to be getting along,
Mrs. Lebowski.

251
00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:01.879
Oh! You're Bunny.

252
00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:05.591
I'll suck your cock
for a thousand dollars.

253
00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:11.388
<i>Wonderful woman!</i>

254
00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.391
We're all-We're all very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

255
00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:17.019
Brandt can't watch though,
or he has to pay a hundred.

256
00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:19.479
That's marvelous.

257
00:16:21.607 --> 00:16:25.485
Uh, I'm just gonna go
find a cash machine.

258
00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.992
Hool
I'm slammin' 'em tonight!

259
00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.203
You guys
are dead in the water.

260
00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:36.914
<i>All right! Way to go, Donny!</i>

261
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.709
"If you will it, it is no dream.“

262
00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:44.004
Fuckin' 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

263
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:46.089
Theodore Herzl.
Huh?

264
00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:49.092
State of Israel. If you will
it, Dude, it is no dream.

265
00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:51.094
What the fuck
are you talking about, man?

266
00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:54.306
The carrier. What's in the
fucking carrier? Huh?

267
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:57.518
Oh! Cynthia's dog.
Think it's a Pomeranian.

268
00:16:57.601 --> 00:17:00.521
Can't leave him home alone,
or he eats the furniture.

269
00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:03.899
I'm watching it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman
are in Hawaii. You brought a Pomeranian bowling?

270
00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:05.901
What do you mean,
brought it bowling?

271
00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:08.904
I didn't rent it shoes.
I'm not buying it a fucking beer.

272
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.906
He's not taking
your fucking turn. Dude.

273
00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:15.410
Man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her
fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu,

274
00:17:15.494 --> 00:17:17.412
I'd tell her to go fuck herself.

275
00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:19.414
Why can't she board it?

276
00:17:19.498 --> 00:17:21.917
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

277
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.920
Secondly, this is a fucking
show dog with fucking papers.

278
00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.881
You can't board it. It gets upset.
Its hair falls out. Walter-

279
00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:30.509
Fucking dog has fucking
papers- Over the line!

280
00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:31.802
Huh?

281
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:35.097
<i>I'm sorry, Smokey. You were over the line.
That's a foul.</i>

282
00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:37.182
Bullshit.
Mark it eight, Dude.

283
00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:39.685
Excuse me.
Mark it zero. Next frame.

284
00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:42.396
<i>Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it eight, Dude.</i>

285
00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:45.399
Smokey. this is not 'Nam.
This is bowling. There are miss.

286
00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:48.193
Hey, Walter, come on.
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

287
00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:51.488
<i>So his toe slipped over a little.
It's just a game, man.</i>

288
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:54.992
This is a league game. This determines who
enters the next round-robin. Am I wrong?

289
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:56.994
<i>Yeah, but I wasn't-
Am</i> I wrong?

290
00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:00.706
Yeah, but I wasn't over. Give me the
marker, Dude. I'm marking an eight.

291
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.499
Smokey. my friend,

292
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.795
you're entering a world of pain.
Walter, man-

293
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.299
<i>You mark that frame an eight,
you're entering a world of pain.</i>

294
00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:12.217
I'm not-

295
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:13.802
A world of pain.

296
00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:16.805
<i>Look, Dude,
this is your partner-</i>

297
00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:21.310
Has the whole world gone crazy? Am I the only one
around here who gives a shit about the rules?

298
00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:24.479
<i>- Matk</i> it zero! - They're calling
the cops, man. Put the piece away.

299
00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:27.816
- Mark it zero!
- Walter, put the piece away.

300
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.486
- Walter- - You think I'm fucking
around here? Mark it zero!

301
00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:40.495
All right.
It's fucking zero.

302
00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:43.290
<i>You happy, you crazy fuck?</i>

303
00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:47.419
It's a league game, Smokey.

304
00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:52.216
You can't do that, man.

305
00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:54.218
These guys, they're like me-
they're pacifists.

306
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.386
Smokey was
a conscientious objector.

307
00:18:56.512 --> 00:19:00.516
You know, Dude, I myself dabbled in pacifism
at one point. Not in 'Nam, of course.

308
00:19:00.516 --> 00:19:04.186
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

309
00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:06.813
You mean, beyond pacifism?

310
00:19:06.897 --> 00:19:10.108
He's fragile.
He's very fragile.

311
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:12.110
Well...

312
00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:14.112
I did not know that.

313
00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:17.199
Well, it's all water under the bridge.

314
00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:20.911
<i>And... we do enter the next round-robin.
Am I wrong?</i>

315
00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.913
No, you're not wrong.

316
00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.916
Am <i>I wrong?</i> You're not wrong, Walter.
You're just an asshole.

317
00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:27.918
Okay then.

318
00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:30.879
Play Quintana and O'Brien next week.
They should be pushovers.

319
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.883
Man, would you just-

320
00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.885
just take it easy, man.

321
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.680
<i>You know, that's your answer
for everything, Dude.</i>

322
00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:42.182
Let me point out something.
Pacifism is not-

323
00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.893
Look at our current situation
with that camel-fucker in Iraq.

324
00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.396
<i>Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.</i>

325
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:49.606
Just take it easy, man.

326
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.608
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

327
00:19:51.692 --> 00:19:55.195
<i>Yeah, waving the Making gun around?</i>
Calmer than <i>you</i> are.

328
00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:57.197
Will you just take it easy!

329
00:19:58.282 --> 00:20:00.284
Calmer than you are.

330
00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.789
<i>Dude, this is Smokey.</i>

331
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:09.293
<i>Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about
this, and I know it wasn't your fault,</i>

332
00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:13.297
<i>but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gilbert
and I will be submitting this to the league...</i>

333
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.799
<i>and asking them
to set aside the round.</i>

334
00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:18.302
<i>I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.</i>

335
00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.805
<i>So, like I say, just thought-
you know, fair warning.</i>

336
00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:24.099
<i>Tell Walter. I'm sorry.</i>

337
00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:28.312
<i>Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt...</i>

338
00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.314
<i>at, uh-</i>

339
00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.316
<i>well, at Mr. Lebowski's office.</i>

340
00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.818
<i>Please call us
as soon as it's convenient.</i>

341
00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:40.490
<i>Mr. Lebowski, this is Mel Zelnicker
of the Southern Cal Bowling League.</i>

342
00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:45.495
<i>I just got an informal report that a
member of your team, a Walter Sobchak,</i>

343
00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:47.789
<i>drew a firearm
during league play.</i>

344
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:51.293
<i>If this is true, it contravenes
a number of the league's bylaws...</i>

345
00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:53.295
<i>and also article 27
of the league-</i>

346
00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:56.798
<i>Dude.</i>
Hey, Marty.

347
00:20:56.882 --> 00:21:01.595
Dude, I- I finally got-
I got the, uh, the venue I wanted.

348
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.806
I'm performing my dance quintet-
you know, my cycle-

349
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.185
<i>at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street theater on Tuesday night.</i>

350
00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:12.481
And, well, I'd love it
if you came and gave me notes.

351
00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:14.483
I'll be there, man.

352
00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:18.278
Uh, Dude. uh,

353
00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.405
tomorrow's already the 10th.

354
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.617
Far out.

355
00:21:25.202 --> 00:21:27.204
Oh. Oh, a-a-all right. Okay.

356
00:21:27.204 --> 00:21:30.499
<i>Just, uh-Just slip the rent
under my door.</i>

357
00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.420
<i>Serious infraction...</i>

358
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.381
<i>and examine your standing.</i>

359
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.383
<i>Thank you.</i>

360
00:21:39.383 --> 00:21:42.386
<i>Mr. Lebowski. Brandt again.</i>

361
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:45.889
<i>Please do call us as soon as you get in,
and I'll send a limo.</i>

362
00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:49.393
<i>I hope you're not avoiding this call
because of the mg,</i>

363
00:21:49.393 --> 00:21:52.396
<i>which, I assure you,
is not a problem.</i>

364
00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:54.982
<i>We need your help, and, uh-</i>

365
00:21:55.107 --> 00:21:58.318
<i>Well, we would very much like to see you.
Thank you.</i>

366
00:21:58.402 --> 00:22:00.404
<i>It's Brandt.</i>

367
00:22:00.404 --> 00:22:04.283
We've had some terrible news. Mr. Lebowski's
in seclusion in the west wing.

368
00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:10.414
Mr. Lebowski.

369
00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:19.381
Funny.

370
00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:23.218
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

371
00:22:23.302 --> 00:22:25.220
<i>challenges met...</i>

372
00:22:25.304 --> 00:22:27.181
<i>competitors bested,</i>

373
00:22:27.306 --> 00:22:29.808
obstacles overcome.

374
00:22:30.809 --> 00:22:32.895
<i>I've accomplished more...</i>

375
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.897
<i>than most men...</i>

376
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.191
<i>and without the use of my legs.</i>

377
00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:39.985
<i>What-</i>

378
00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:44.489
What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?

379
00:22:45.616 --> 00:22:47.618
Dude.
<i>Huh?</i>

380
00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:51.788
Oh, I- I don't know, sir.

381
00:22:51.914 --> 00:22:55.417
<i>Is it being prepared
to do the right thing,</i>

382
00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:58.921
whatever the cost?

383
00:22:59.004 --> 00:23:01.507
<i>Isn't that what makes a man?</i>

384
00:23:01.715 --> 00:23:04.718
Mmm, sure.
That and a pair of testicles.

385
00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:07.888
You're joking, but...

386
00:23:09.515 --> 00:23:11.391
perhaps you're right.

387
00:23:11.517 --> 00:23:13.393
You mind if I do a "J"?

388
00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:16.688
Bunny.

389
00:23:18.482 --> 00:23:20.484
Excuse me?

390
00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:22.903
<i>Bunny Lebowski.</i>

391
00:23:22.986 --> 00:23:25.697
<i>She is the light of my life.</i>

392
00:23:26.782 --> 00:23:29.201
Are you surprised at my tears, sir?

393
00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.913
Oh, fuckin'-A.

394
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:36.291
<i>Strong men also cry.</i>

395
00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:38.293
Strong men...

396
00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:40.420
also cry.

397
00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.884
<i>I received this fax
this morning.</i>

398
00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.597
As you can see,

399
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:52.683
it is a ransom note...

400
00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:55.185
"We have Bunny.

401
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.314

<i>Huh?</i>

409
00:24:15.497 --> 00:24:18.584
This is a bummer, man.
That's, uh-That's a bummer.

410
00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:21.712
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

411
00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:41.607
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
generous offer to you to act as courier,

412
00:24:41.607 --> 00:24:44.109
once we get instructions
for the money.

413
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:46.111
Why me, man?

414
00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:50.991
He believes the culprits might be the
very people who, uh, soiled your rug,

415
00:24:51.116 --> 00:24:55.495
and you are in a unique position
to confirm or disoonfinn that suspicion.

416
00:24:55.579 --> 00:24:57.915
He thinks
the carpet-pissers did this?

417
00:24:57.998 --> 00:25:00.709
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

418
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:39.600
Fucking Quintana.

419
00:26:39.683 --> 00:26:42.311
That creep can roll, man.

420
00:26:42.394 --> 00:26:44.313
Yeah,
but he's a pervert, Dude.

421
00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:46.315
Yeah.

422
00:26:46.398 --> 00:26:49.318
No, he's a sex offender
with a record.

423
00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:52.696
He did six months in Chino for exposing
himself to an eight-year-old. Huh!

424
00:26:54.698 --> 00:26:57.784
<i>When he moved to Hollywood, he had to go
door-to-door to tell everyone he was a pederast.</i>

425
00:26:57.784 --> 00:27:00.204
<i>What's a pederast, Walter?</i>

426
00:27:00.287 --> 00:27:03.207
<i>Shut the fuck up, Donny.</i>

427
00:27:04.917 --> 00:27:06.793
So, how much did he give you?

428
00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:09.796
Twenty grand, man. And, of course,
I still get to keep the rug.

429
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.798
Just for making a hand-off?
Yeah.

430
00:27:11.882 --> 00:27:14.384
They gave, uh, Dude a beeper.

431
00:27:15.385 --> 00:27:18.013
So whenever these guys call-
What if it's during a game?

432
00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:20.516
Oh, I told them
if it was during league play-

433
00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:22.518
What's during league play?

434
00:27:22.601 --> 00:27:26.396
Life does not stop and start at your
convenience, you miserable piece of shit.

435
00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:28.690
I-I figure, uh- What's
wrong with Walter, Dude?

436
00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:31.193
I figure it's easy money.
It's all pretty harmless.

437
00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:33.195
She probably kidnapped hersetf.
Huh?

438
00:27:33.278 --> 00:27:35.197
Oh- What do you mean, Dude?

439
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.199
Rug-peers
did not do this.

440
00:27:37.282 --> 00:27:41.411
Look at it. A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

441
00:27:41.411 --> 00:27:44.414
She figures he isn't
giving her enough, you know.

442
00:27:44.414 --> 00:27:46.416
She owes money all over town.

443
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:48.919
That fuckin' bitch.
Oh, yeah.

444
00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:50.879
It's all a goddamn fake, man.

445
00:27:51.004 --> 00:27:52.881
It's like Lenin said-

446
00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:57.386
You look for the person who will
benefit, and, uh, uh, you know, uh,

447
00:27:57.511 --> 00:28:00.389
"I Am the Walrus"? you
know, you'll, uh, uh, w-

448
00:28:00.514 --> 00:28:03.308
You know what I'm trying to say.
"I Am the Walrus.“

449
00:28:03.392 --> 00:28:05.811
That fucking bitch!
Oh, yeah!

450
00:28:05.894 --> 00:28:09.189
"I Am the Walrus.“ That's ex-
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

451
00:28:09.189 --> 00:28:12.192
V.I. Lenin!
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

452
00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:15.195
What the fuck is he talking about?
Fuckin' exactly what happened to those-

453
00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.197
<i>That makes me fuckin' sick!</i>

454
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:19.992
<i>Well, what do you care, Walter?
Those n'ch fucks.</i>

455
00:28:20.117 --> 00:28:22.119
This whole fuckin' thing-

456
00:28:22.202 --> 00:28:25.205
I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck...

457
00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:28.208
so that this fuckin' strumpet, this
fuckin' whore could waltz around-

458
00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:30.711
Walter, I don't see any connection
with Vietnam, man!

459
00:28:30.711 --> 00:28:34.298
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
No, face it, there isn'bny connection.

460
00:28:34.298 --> 00:28:36.300
Your roll. Have it you r way.
But my point-

461
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.302
Your roll.
My point is-

462
00:28:38.302 --> 00:28:40.387
<i>Are you ready to be fucked, man?</i>

463
00:28:41.805 --> 00:28:44.683
I see you rolled your way
into the semis.

464
00:28:45.684 --> 00:28:47.895
<i>Dias mHo,</i> man.

465
00:28:47.895 --> 00:28:50.898
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

466
00:28:50.898 --> 00:28:55.319
Yeah? Well, you know,
that's just like, uh,

467
00:28:55.402 --> 00:28:57.404
your opinion, man.

468
00:28:58.488 --> 00:29:00.991
Let me telyou something,
<i>pendejo.</i>

469
00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:04.203
<i>You pull any
of your crazy shit with us-</i>

470
00:29:04.286 --> 00:29:06.788
you flash a piece out on the lanes,

471
00:29:06.914 --> 00:29:09.791
I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass...

472
00:29:09.917 --> 00:29:13.086
and pull the fuckin' trigger
till it goes "click."

473
00:29:14.087 --> 00:29:15.881
Jesus.

474
00:29:15.881 --> 00:29:18.008
You said it, man.

475
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:20.302
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

476
00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:28.101
<i>Eight-year-oms, Dude.</i>

477
00:31:31.808 --> 00:31:33.894
<i>They called about 80 minutes ago.</i>

478
00:31:33.894 --> 00:31:36.897
They want you to take the
money, drive north on the 405.

479
00:31:36.897 --> 00:31:40.400
They will call you on the portable phone
with instructions in about 40 minutes.

480
00:31:40.484 --> 00:31:43.403
One person only. They were very
clear on that, or I'd go with you.

481
00:31:43.487 --> 00:31:45.405
What happened to your jaw?

482
00:31:45.489 --> 00:31:48.408
Oh, nothing, man. I just, uh-

483
00:31:48.492 --> 00:31:50.786
Here's the money.

484
00:31:50.786 --> 00:31:52.788
And the phone.

485
00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:56.291
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give. All right.

486
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:58.293
Her life is in your hands.

487
00:31:58.293 --> 00:32:00.295
Man,
don't say that, man.

488
00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:04.216
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: her
life is in your hands. Oh, shit, man.

489
00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:06.218
Her life is in your hands,
Dude.

490
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:08.887
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

491
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.399
Where the fuck
are you going, man?

492
00:32:20.482 --> 00:32:22.401
Take the ringer.
I'll drive.

493
00:32:22.484 --> 00:32:25.195
The what?
The ringer.

494
00:32:25.195 --> 00:32:27.197
<i>Theringer;</i> Dude.

495
00:32:33.912 --> 00:32:36.790
What the-
<i>Have they called yet?</i>

496
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.500
What the hell is this?

497
00:32:38.584 --> 00:32:41.503
My dirty undies, Dude.
The laundry. The whites.

498
00:32:41.587 --> 00:32:46.300
<i>Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies, man.</i>

499
00:32:46.383 --> 00:32:50.888
That's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer cannot
look empty. <i>What</i> the <i>fllOk</i> are you <i>thinking?</i>

500
00:32:50.888 --> 00:32:52.890
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinkin'.

501
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:56.894
- I got to thinkin', why should we settle for a
measly fuckin' 20 grand- - “We"? What the fuck, ”we"?

502
00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:58.896
You said you just wanted
to come along.

503
00:32:59.021 --> 00:33:04.193
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for 20 grand
when we can keep the entire million? Am I wrong?

504
00:33:04.318 --> 00:33:07.112
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a fucking game, man.

505
00:33:07.196 --> 00:33:10.908
Oh, but iiis a game. You said so yourself.
She kidnapped herself.

506
00:33:10.991 --> 00:33:13.410
I said I thought-

507
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:20.709
Dude here.
Who is this?

508
00:33:21.793 --> 00:33:24.713
Dude. The bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

509
00:33:24.796 --> 00:33:27.007
"Us"?

510
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.510
Shit!

511
00:33:30.594 --> 00:33:33.180
Yeah. You know.
Uh, me and the driver.

512
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:37.100
I'm not, uh, handling the money, driving the
ear and talking on the phone all by my fu-

513
00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:40.103
- Shut the fuck up!
- Dude, are you fuckin' this up?

514
00:33:40.187 --> 00:33:42.481
Who is that?

515
00:33:42.481 --> 00:33:44.483
That is the driver.

516
00:33:44.483 --> 00:33:46.818
I told you-

517
00:33:46.818 --> 00:33:49.112
- Oh, shit!
- What thefilck's goin' on there?

518
00:33:49.196 --> 00:33:51.114
Walte <i>r- What the
flick is goin ' on ?</i>

519
00:33:51.198 --> 00:33:54.785
He hung up, man. You fucked it up.
You fucked it up!

520
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.079
<i>Her life was in our hands, man.</i>
Easy, Dude.

521
00:33:57.204 --> 00:34:01.291
<i>We're screwed now. We don't get shit.
They're gonna kill her.</i>

522
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:03.293
<i>We'refucked,</i> Walter!

523
00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:06.797
Nothing is fucked, Dude. Come on.
You're being very un-Dude.

524
00:34:06.797 --> 00:34:09.299
<i>They'll call back.
Look, she kidnapped her-</i>

525
00:34:09.299 --> 00:34:12.803
<i>You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.</i>

526
00:34:12.803 --> 00:34:16.682
Nothing is fucked.
They're a bunch of fuckin' amateurs!

527
00:34:16.807 --> 00:34:21.311
Will you just shut the fuck up?
Don't say peep while I'm doing business here.

528
00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:24.606
<i>Okay, Dude.
Have it your way.</i>

529
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.900
But they're amateurs.

530
00:34:26.984 --> 00:34:28.986
Fuck.

531
00:34:29.987 --> 00:34:33.907
Dude. Okay, we proceed , but
only if there is no funny stuff.

532
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:35.909
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:34:35.993 --> 00:34:37.911
So no funny stuff. Okay?

534
00:34:37.995 --> 00:34:40.789
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

535
00:34:44.418 --> 00:34:46.587
That was the sign, man.

536
00:34:46.712 --> 00:34:50.299
So, all we gotta do
is get her back.

537
00:34:50.382 --> 00:34:52.593
No one's in a position
to complain.

538
00:34:52.718 --> 00:34:55.304
We keep the baksheesh.
Yeah, terrific, Walter:.

539
00:34:55.387 --> 00:34:57.890
But you haven't told me how we're
gonna get her back. Where is she?

540
00:34:58.015 --> 00:34:59.892
That's the simple part, Dude.

541
00:35:00.017 --> 00:35:03.687
We make the hand-off,
I grab one of 'em and beat it out of him.

542
00:35:03.812 --> 00:35:07.816
- Huh?
- That's a great plan, Walter.

543
00:35:07.816 --> 00:35:11.820
That's fuckin' ingenious, if I understand
it correctly. It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.

544
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.490
<i>That's right, Dude.
The beauty of this is its simplicity.</i>

545
00:35:15.616 --> 00:35:18.994
Once a plan gets too complex,
everything can go wrong.

546
00:35:18.994 --> 00:35:21.705
If there's one thing
I learned in 'Nam-

547
00:35:23.415 --> 00:35:25.292
Dude.

548
00:35:25.417 --> 00:35:27.794
You are coming to wooden bridge.

549
00:35:27.794 --> 00:35:31.590
When you cross the bridge, you throw the bag
from the left window of the moving car.

550
00:35:31.715 --> 00:35:33.592
<i>You're being watched.</i>

551
00:35:33.717 --> 00:35:35.594
Fuck.

552
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:38.680
<i>What'd he say? Where's the hand-ofl'?</i>
There <i>is no</i> fuckin' hand-off, man.

553
00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.807
At the wooden bridge
we throw the money out of the car.

554
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:43.894
Huh? <i>We throw the money
out of the moving car.</i>

555
00:35:45.187 --> 00:35:47.898
We can't do that, Dude.
That fucks up our plan.

556
00:35:47.981 --> 00:35:50.400
Well, call them up
and explain it to them.

557
00:35:50.484 --> 00:35:54.488
Your plan is so simple, I'm sure they'll fuckin'
understand it. That's the beauty of it.

558
00:35:54.613 --> 00:35:56.782
<i>Wooden bridge, huh? Throw
'em the money, Walter.</i>

559
00:35:56.782 --> 00:36:00.702
- We're not fucking around, man. - Okay, Dude, the
bridge is coming up. Give me the ringer, chop-chop.

560
00:36:00.786 --> 00:36:05.707
<i>Fuck that. Walter, I love you, but sooner or later you're
gonna have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron.</i>

561
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:07.709
- No time to argue.
- Hey, man-

562
00:36:07.709 --> 00:36:10.087
<i>- The</i> bridge.
<i>- Hey, Walter- Hey, Walter!</i>

563
00:36:10.212 --> 00:36:12.381
Hey, <i>Walter-</i>
Here goes the ringer!

564
00:36:14.508 --> 00:36:16.510
What <i>the</i> fuck?
<i>Okay, Dude, your wheel.</i>

565
00:36:16.593 --> 00:36:19.012
<i>- Hey, man- What the fuck!
- At 15m.p.h., [roll out.</i>

566
00:36:19.012 --> 00:36:21.515
<i>I double back, grab one of 'em
and beat it out of him. The Uzi.</i>

567
00:36:21.515 --> 00:36:24.393
Uzi? You didn't think I was rollin'
out of here naked, did ya?

568
00:36:24.393 --> 00:36:27.104
- Walter, please!
- 15, Dude! Let's take that hill!

569
00:36:27.187 --> 00:36:29.314
- Aaahl
- Walter!

570
00:36:42.995 --> 00:36:46.498
Uh- Uh-

571
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.211
Hey! We have it!

572
00:36:51.295 --> 00:36:54.006
We have it!

573
00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:56.592
We have it!

574
00:36:56.717 --> 00:36:58.594
We... have it!

575
00:37:12.983 --> 00:37:16.486
Ah. fuck it, Dude.
Let's go bowling.

576
00:37:54.816 --> 00:37:57.819
<i>Aitz chaim</i> he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

577
00:37:57.819 --> 00:38:00.280
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

578
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.200
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

579
00:38:03.283 --> 00:38:05.702
Oh, him. Uh-

580
00:38:05.786 --> 00:38:08.705
I don't know.
What, exactly. is the problem?

581
00:38:08.789 --> 00:38:11.708
The problem is-

582
00:38:11.792 --> 00:38:14.211
What do you mean,
what's the-

583
00:38:14.294 --> 00:38:16.213
T-There was no-

584
00:38:16.296 --> 00:38:18.215
We didn't, uh-

585
00:38:18.298 --> 00:38:20.717
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man!

586
00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:23.178
What the fuck
are you talking about?

587
00:38:23.303 --> 00:38:26.890
The poor woman- That poorslut kidnapped
herserf. Come on, Dude. You said so yourself.

588
00:38:27.015 --> 00:38:29.393
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

589
00:38:29.518 --> 00:38:33.689
You're the one who's so certain. That's
right, Dude. One hundred percent certain.

590
00:38:33.689 --> 00:38:36.692
- They posted the next round for the
tournament. - Donny, shut the fuck-

591
00:38:36.692 --> 00:38:39.194
When <i>do we</i> play? <i>This Saturday.
Quintana and-</i>

592
00:38:39.194 --> 00:38:41.196
Saturday?
Well, they'll have to reschedule.

593
00:38:41.196 --> 00:38:43.198
Walter, what am I
gonna tell Lebowski?

594
00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:45.993
I told that fuck down at the league
office- Who's in charge of scheduling?

595
00:38:46.118 --> 00:38:48.412
- Walter-
- Burkhalter.

596
00:38:48.412 --> 00:38:51.707
I told that kraut a fuckin' thousand
times, I don't roll <i>omhabbosl</i> Walter-

597
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.001
<i>They already posted</i> it. Well,
he can fuckin' un-post it!

598
00:38:54.084 --> 00:38:57.504
Who gives a shit? They're gonna
kill that poor woman, man!

599
00:38:57.588 --> 00:38:59.506
What am I gonna
tell Lebowski?

600
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.010
Uh, eventually she'll get tired of
her little game and wander on back.

601
00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:05.888
- How come you don't roll on Saturday,
Walter? - I'mshomer shabbos.

602
00:39:06.013 --> 00:39:09.391
<i>What's that, Walter?</i> Yeah, and in the
meantime, what do I tell Lebowski?

603
00:39:09.516 --> 00:39:12.394
Saturday, Donny, isshabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

604
00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:15.397
That means I don't work, I don't drive
a car, I don't fuckin' ride in a car,

605
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.900
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

606
00:39:17.983 --> 00:39:19.985
and I sure as shitdon't <i>flicking mill</i>

607

0h, fuck! That's it. I'm outta here.
Oh, come on, Dude.

611
00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:32.915
What a fuckin' baby.

612
00:39:32.915 --> 00:39:35.584
<i>Dude! Dude!</i>

613
00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:37.586
Oww! Fuck.

614
00:39:37.711 --> 00:39:41.590
You just tell him, uh- tell him we made
the drop and everything went, you know-

615
00:39:41.715 --> 00:39:44.593
Oh, yeah. How'd it 90? Want all right.
Dude's car got a little dinged up.

616
00:39:44.718 --> 00:39:49.097
Walter, we didn't make the fuckin' hand-off,
man! They didn't get the fuckin' money!

617
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:51.099
And they're gonna-
they're gonna-

618
00:39:51.183 --> 00:39:53.101
And they're gonna kill
that poor woman.

619
00:39:53.185 --> 00:39:55.103
They're gonna kill that poor woman!

620
00:39:55.187 --> 00:39:58.106
Walter, if you can't ride in a car,
then how do you get around <i>onshabbos?</i>

621
00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:01.610
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not
gonna kill shit. They're not gonna do shit.

622
00:40:01.693 --> 00:40:06.615
What can they do? They're a bunch of fuckin'
amateurs. And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.

623
00:40:06.698 --> 00:40:09.618
Who's sittin' on a million fuckin' dollars?
Am I wrong? Walter-

624
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:13.580
Who's got a million fuckin' dollars sittin'
in the trunk of our car? Our car, Walter?

625
00:40:13.705 --> 00:40:16.208
And what <i>dothey</i> got?
My dirty undies.

626
00:40:16.291 --> 00:40:18.710
My fuckin' whites!

627
00:40:22.881 --> 00:40:25.801
Say, Dude?

628
00:40:25.884 --> 00:40:27.803
Whereis your car?

629
00:40:27.886 --> 00:40:31.098
Who's got your undies, Walter?
Where's your car, Dude?

630
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:33.100
You don't know, Walter?

631
00:40:33.183 --> 00:40:37.521
<i>It was parked in a handicapped zone.
Perhaps they towed it.</i>

632
00:40:38.897 --> 00:40:41.400
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

633
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.486
Well, certainly
that's a possibility, Dude.

634
00:40:45.988 --> 00:40:48.282
Oh, fuck it.

635
00:40:48.282 --> 00:40:51.201
<i>Where you gain ', Dude ?</i>

636
00:40:51.201 --> 00:40:53.203
I'm going home, Donny.

<i>Phone's ringing, Dude.</i>

638
00:40:55.205 --> 00:40:57.207
Thank you, Donny!

639

green and some, uh, brown,

641
00:41:17.603 --> 00:41:20.898
uh, rust coloration.

642
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:23.901
And was there
anything of value in the ear?

643
00:41:23.984 --> 00:41:25.903
<i>Oh, uh, yeah.</i>

644
00:41:25.986 --> 00:41:28.197
<i>Uh, a tape deck,</i>

uh, my briefcase.

648
00:41:37.206 --> 00:41:39.583
In the briefcase?

649
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.212
Uh, uh, papers.

650
00:41:43.295 --> 00:41:45.297
Um, just papers.

651
00:41:45.297 --> 00:41:48.592
Uh, you know, uh, my papers-

652
00:41:48.717 --> 00:41:51.303
business papers.

653
00:41:51.386 --> 00:41:55.015
And <i>what</i> do you do, <i>sir?</i>
I'm unemployed.

654
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:01.104
My rug was also stolen.

655
00:42:01.104 --> 00:42:03.398
<i>Your mg was in the car?</i>

656
00:42:03.482 --> 00:42:05.400
No. Here.

657
00:42:05.484 --> 00:42:06.693
Separate incidents.

658
00:42:08.695 --> 00:42:11.281
The Dude is not in.

659
00:42:11.406 --> 00:42:15.202
Do you find 'em much,
these stolen cars?

660
00:42:15.285 --> 00:42:17.579
<i>Sometimes.</i>

661
00:42:17.704 --> 00:42:21.500
But I wouldn't hold out much hope for
the tape deck though. Or the Creedenoe.

662
00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:25.879
W-What about, uh...
the briefcase?

663
00:42:25.879 --> 00:42:27.881
<i>Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.</i>

664
00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:31.301
<i>Call when you get home, and I'll send a
car for you. My name is Maude Lebowski.</i>

665
00:42:31.385 --> 00:42:33.303
<i>I'm the one
who took your rug.</i>

666
00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:37.516
<i>Well, guess we can
close the file on that one.</i>

667
00:43:09.298 --> 00:43:12.092
Huh.

668
00:43:27.399 --> 00:43:31.403
I'll be with you in a moment,
Mr. Lebowski.

669
00:43:50.005 --> 00:43:53.008
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

670
00:43:53.008 --> 00:43:56.386
<i>Uh, is that what
this is a picture of?</i>

671
00:43:56.512 --> 00:43:58.388
In a sense, yes.

672
00:43:58.514 --> 00:44:01.391
My art has been commended as being
strongly vaginal, which bothers some men.

673
00:44:01.517 --> 00:44:04.394
The word itself
makes some men uncomfortable.

674
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.314
- Vagina.
- Oh, yeah?

675
00:44:07.397 --> 00:44:10.192
Yes, they don't like hearing it
and find it difficult to say,

676
00:44:10.317 --> 00:44:12.986
whereas without batting an eye,
a man will refer to his dick or his red...

677
00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:14.988
or his johnson.

678
00:44:15.113 --> 00:44:17.199
"Johnson“?

679
00:44:17.282 --> 00:44:20.118
All right, Mr. Lebowski,
let's get down to cases.

680
00:44:20.202 --> 00:44:22.704
My father told me
he agreed to let you have the rug,

681
00:44:22.788 --> 00:44:26.500
but as it was a gift from me to my
late mother, it was not his to give.

682
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.586
Now, your face.

683
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:32.714
As for this kidnapping-
Huh?

684
00:44:32.798 --> 00:44:36.385
<i>Yes, I know all about it,
and I know that you acted as courier.</i>

685
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:39.805
Let me tell you something.
The whole thing stinks to high heaven.

686
00:44:39.888 --> 00:44:44.017
<i>Yeah, right, but let me
explain something about the rug.</i>

687
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:47.104
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

688
00:44:47.187 --> 00:44:49.690
Excuse me? Sex. The
physical act of love.

689
00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.900
Coitus.
Do you like it?

690
00:44:51.984 --> 00:44:55.612
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?

691
00:44:55.696 --> 00:44:58.407
You mean coitus?

692
00:44:58.407 --> 00:45:01.410
I like it too. It's a male myth
about feminists that we hate sax.

693
00:45:01.493 --> 00:45:03.704
It can be a natural. zesty enterprise.

694
00:45:03.787 --> 00:45:08.208
However, there are some people- it is called
satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women-

695
00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:11.211
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

696
00:45:11.295 --> 00:45:12.880
Oh, no.

697
00:45:13.005 --> 00:45:14.882
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

698
00:45:15.007 --> 00:45:18.510
These unfortunate souls cannot love,
in the true sense of the word.

699
00:45:18.594 --> 00:45:22.014
Our mutual acquaintance, Bunny,
is one of these.

700
00:45:22.181 --> 00:45:25.309
Listen, Maude, um,

701
00:45:25.392 --> 00:45:27.895
I'm sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho,

702
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.190
but, uh, I don't see
what this has to do with. uh-

703
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:34.193
- You have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.

704
00:45:34.193 --> 00:45:37.112
<i>Hmm?</i>

705
00:45:37.196 --> 00:45:40.908
<i>Oh, I know that guy.</i>

706
00:45:40.991 --> 00:45:43.118
Uh, he's a nihilist.

707
00:45:44.912 --> 00:45:47.915
<i>"Karl Hungus.'</i>

708
00:45:59.801 --> 00:46:01.678
Hello.

709
00:46:01.803 --> 00:46:04.890
<i>Main dispatcher says there is
something wrong w'fldein kabel.</i>

710
00:46:05.015 --> 00:46:07.100
Yeah. Come on in.

711
00:46:07.184 --> 00:46:10.103
I'm not really sure exactly what's wrong
with the cable. That's why they sent me.

712
00:46:10.187 --> 00:46:12.481
I am an expert.
The TV's in here.

713
00:46:12.606 --> 00:46:15.817
You recognize her, of course.
Helga, bring my tools.

714
00:46:18.904 --> 00:46:22.199
That's my friend Sherry.
She just came over to use the shower.

715
00:46:22.282 --> 00:46:24.493
The story is ludicrous.

716
00:46:24.618 --> 00:46:27.704
My name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.

717
00:46:27.788 --> 00:46:29.581
You must be here
to fix the cable.

718
00:46:29.706 --> 00:46:32.501
<i>Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.</i>

719
00:46:32.584 --> 00:46:34.503
He fixes the cable?

720
00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:36.713
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

721
00:46:36.797 --> 00:46:40.217
<i>Little matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career in pornography,</i>

722
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.179
nor that she has been “banging" Jackie
Treehom, to use the parlance of our times.

723
00:46:44.304 --> 00:46:50.185
However, I am one of the two trustees of the
Lebowski Foundation, the other being my father.

724
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.396
<i>The foundation
takes youngsters from Watts and-</i>

725
00:46:52.521 --> 00:46:54.398
Shit, yeah.
The Achievers.

726
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:57.693
<i>Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes,
and proud we are of all of them.</i>

727
00:46:57.818 --> 00:47:01.196
I asked my father about his withdrawal of a
million dollars from the foundation account,

728
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.198
and he told me
about this abduction,

729
00:47:03.198 --> 00:47:05.200
but I tell you it is preposterous.

730
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.204
This compulsive fornicator is taking
my father for the proverbial ride.

731
00:47:09.288 --> 00:47:11.707
Yeah, <i>but my-
I'm getting to your rug.</i>

732
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.709
My father and I don't get along.

733
00:47:13.792 --> 00:47:17.212
He doesn't approve of my lifestyle and,
needless to say, I don't approve of his.

734
00:47:17.296 --> 00:47:20.215
However, I hardly wish to make my
father's embezzlement a police matter.

735
00:47:20.299 --> 00:47:25.179
So I'm proposing that you try to recover the
money from the people you delivered it to.

736
00:47:25.304 --> 00:47:27.598
Well, I...

737
00:47:27.681 --> 00:47:29.600
could do that.

738
00:47:29.683 --> 00:47:34.980
If you successfully do so, I will compensate
you to the tune of 10% of the recovered sum.

739
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.399
A hundred-
<i>Thousand. Yes.</i>

740
00:47:37.482 --> 00:47:40.402
Bones or clams
or whatever you call them.

741
00:47:40.485 --> 00:47:44.198
<i>Yeah, uh, b-but, uh,
w-w-what about my, uh-</i>

742
00:47:44.281 --> 00:47:46.408
Your rug, yes.

743
00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:50.287
Well, with that money you can buy any number of
rugs that don't have sentimental value for me.

744
00:47:50.412 --> 00:47:53.081
And I am sorry
about that crack on the jaw.

745
00:47:53.207 --> 00:47:55.792
Oh, that's- that's fine.
Th-That doesn't even, uh-

746
00:47:55.918 --> 00:47:59.588
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will
look at it for you. You will receive no bill.

747
00:47:59.713 --> 00:48:01.590
He's a good man, and thorough.

748
00:48:01.715 --> 00:48:03.800
Th-Th-That's thoughtful, but-

749
00:48:03.884 --> 00:48:06.803
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man. And thorough.

750
00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.682
Oh, well, uh, all right.

751
00:48:12.518 --> 00:48:16.480
So he says, ”My wife's a pain in the ass.
She's always bustin' my friggin' agates.

752
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.982
<i>"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.</i>

753
00:48:19.107 --> 00:48:22.486
<i>"I got a rash so bad on my ass
I can't even sit down.</i>

754
00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:23.987
But you know me-
I can't complain."

755
00:48:24.112 --> 00:48:26.990
Oh, fuckin'-A, man.

756
00:48:27.115 --> 00:48:29.993
I got a rash, man.
Fuckin'-A.

757
00:48:30.118 --> 00:48:33.580
Mmm. I gotta tell ya, Tone, man.

758
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.500
Earlier today
I was really feeling shitty, man.

759
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:38.502
Really down in the dumps.

760
00:48:38.585 --> 00:48:40.504
<i>Lost a little money-</i>

761
00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:44.216
Hey, you know what? Forget about it, huh?
Forget about it.

762
00:48:44.216 --> 00:48:47.886
Yeah, fuck it, man. You can't be worried
about that shit. Life goes on, man.

763
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:50.180
<i>Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. I.</i>

764
00:48:53.183 --> 00:48:55.811
<i>Hey, yo. Come here.</i>

765
00:48:55.894 --> 00:48:59.189
- Who's your friend in the Volkswagen?
- Huh?

766
00:48:59.314 --> 00:49:02.192
<i>Yeah.
He followed us here.</i>

767
00:49:02.317 --> 00:49:05.195
When did he start f-
Whoa! What the fuck?

768
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.615
Get in the limo, you son of a bitch!
No arguments! Hey! Hey! Careful, man!

769
00:49:08.699 --> 00:49:10.701
There's a beverage here!
Hey!

770
00:49:10.784 --> 00:49:14.288
<i>Start talking,
and talk fast, you lousy bum.</i>

771
00:49:14.288 --> 00:49:17.207
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

772
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:20.502
<i>Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?</i>

773
00:49:20.586 --> 00:49:23.213
Well, we- I-I-I don't-

774
00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:25.799
<i>They did not receive the money,
you nitwit!</i>

775
00:49:25.883 --> 00:49:29.303
They did not receive the money!
Her life was in your hands!

776
00:49:29.386 --> 00:49:31.305
This is our concern, Dude.

777
00:49:31.388 --> 00:49:34.016
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

778
00:49:34.099 --> 00:49:36.018
"Nothing is fucked"?
No, <i>man.</i>

779
00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:39.396
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!

780
00:49:39.479 --> 00:49:44.902
Man, come on. Who are you gonna believe, those
guys or- We dropped off the damn money.

781
00:49:44.985 --> 00:49:47.487
"We"?

782
00:49:48.488 --> 00:49:50.616
I. The royal "we."

783
00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:52.618
You know. The editorial-

784
00:49:52.701 --> 00:49:55.078
I dropped off the money
exactly as per-

785
00:49:55.204 --> 00:49:58.707
Look... man, I've got
certain information. All right?

786
00:49:58.707 --> 00:50:01.502
<i>Certain things
have come to light, and-</i>

787
00:50:01.502 --> 00:50:04.796
Has it ever occurred to you...

788
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.798
that instead of, uh, you know,

789
00:50:06.882 --> 00:50:09.384
running around,
uh, uh, blaming me-

790
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.387
you know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

791
00:50:12.513 --> 00:50:17.684
this could be a-a-a-a lot more, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, complex-

792
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:22.689
I mean, it's not just- it might not
be just such a simple, uh-You know?

793
00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:25.817
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

794
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:28.820
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm blathering about.

795
00:50:28.904 --> 00:50:30.781
I've got information, man.

796
00:50:30.906 --> 00:50:32.783
New shit has come to light.

797
00:50:32.908 --> 00:50:35.202
A-And, shit, man,

798
00:50:36.703 --> 00:50:39.498
she kidnapped herself.

799
00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:43.001
<i>Well, sure, man.</i>

800
00:50:43.085 --> 00:50:45.003
Look at it. You know?

801
00:50:45.087 --> 00:50:48.507
A young trophy wife,
in the parlance of our times, you know.

802
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.510
She, uh, uh, uh, owes money
all over town,

803
00:50:51.593 --> 00:50:53.512
including
to known pornographers.

804
00:50:55.597 --> 00:50:58.517
And that's cool.
That's-That's cool.

805
00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.896
<i>L- I-I'm saying
she needs money, man.</i>

806
00:51:02.896 --> 00:51:06.400
And, you know, of course
they're gonna say they didn't get it,

807
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.320
uh, uh,
because she wants more, men.

808
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.281
She's gotta feed the monkey.

809
00:51:12.406 --> 00:51:14.783
I-I <i>mean,</i> uh-

810
00:51:14.908 --> 00:51:17.995
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

811
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.997
Sir?

812
00:51:21.707 --> 00:51:24.918
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.

813
00:51:25.002 --> 00:51:26.920
That had not occurred to us,
Dude.

814
00:51:27.004 --> 00:51:28.881
<i>Well, okay, you know?</i>

815
00:51:29.006 --> 00:51:33.385
You guys aren't privy to
all the new shit, so, uh, you know-

816
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:38.015
But, hey, that's what you, uh-
that's what you pay me for.

817
00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:40.601
<i>Mmm.
Speaking of which,</i>

818
00:51:40.601 --> 00:51:44.897
do you think, uh, that you could,
uh, give me my 20,000 in cash?

819
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.983
Uh, my concern is, and I've
gotta check with my accountant,

820
00:51:47.983 --> 00:51:50.819
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax, uh-

821
00:51:50.819 --> 00:51:53.906
<i>Brandt, give him the envelope.</i>

822
00:51:53.989 --> 00:51:58.118
<i>Oh, well, if you've already got the-
the check made out, the-that's cool.</i>

823
00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:00.787
<i>We received this
this morning.</i>

824
00:52:02.706 --> 00:52:06.084
Since you have failed
to achieve...

825
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:09.087
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

826
00:52:09.213 --> 00:52:12.716
<i>since you have stolen
my money,</i>

827
00:52:12.716 --> 00:52:16.595
<i>since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,</i>

828
00:52:16.678 --> 00:52:20.807
I have no choice
but to tell these bums...

829
00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:23.185
<i>to do whatever is necessary...</i>

830
00:52:23.185 --> 00:52:28.482
to recover their money fromyou,
Jeffrey Lebowski.

831
00:52:28.482 --> 00:52:31.902
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this-

832
00:52:31.985 --> 00:52:36.490
<i>any further harm
visited upon Bunny...</i>

833
00:52:36.615 --> 00:52:40.118
with be visited tenfold
uporyour head.

834
00:52:42.496 --> 00:52:44.414
<i>By God, sir,</i>

835
00:52:44.498 --> 00:52:47.709
<i>I will not abide another toe.</i>

836
00:52:53.215 --> 00:52:55.300
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

837
00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:00.013
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?

838
00:53:00.013 --> 00:53:03.392
I do know that nothing about it indicates
that it was her- The nail polish, Walter!

839
00:53:03.517 --> 00:53:05.394
Fine, Dude.

840
00:53:05.519 --> 00:53:08.897
As if it's impossible to get some nail
polish, apply it to someone else's toe-

841
00:53:08.981 --> 00:53:10.899
Someone else-
Pinking shears.

842
00:53:10.983 --> 00:53:14.403
Where the fuck are they gonna get-
You want a toe? I can get you a toe.

843
00:53:14.486 --> 00:53:16.405
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

844
00:53:16.488 --> 00:53:19.408
You don't wanna know about it. Believe me.
Yeah, but, Walter-

845
00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:22.411
Hell, I could get you a toe by 3:00
this afternoon, with nail polish.

846
00:53:22.494 --> 00:53:24.413
These fuckin' amateurs.
Walter-

847
00:53:24.496 --> 00:53:27.416
They send us a toe, we're supposed
to shit ourselves with fear.

848
00:53:27.499 --> 00:53:29.418
Jesus Christ!
Walter-

849
00:53:29.501 --> 00:53:33.088
The point is- They're gonna kill her,
Walter, and then they're gonna kill me.

850
00:53:33.213 --> 00:53:35.591
Dude, that's-

851
00:53:37.009 --> 00:53:39.011
that's just the stress talking, man.

852
00:53:39.011 --> 00:53:44.016
Now, so far we have what appears to me
to be a series of victimless crimes.

853
00:53:44.016 --> 00:53:46.894
What about the toe?
Forget about the fucking toe!

854
00:53:46.894 --> 00:53:49.897
<i>Excuse me, sir. Could you
please keep your voices down?</i>

855
00:53:49.897 --> 00:53:51.982
This is a family restaurant.

856
00:53:52.107 --> 00:53:57.696
Oh, please. Dear, for your information, the Supreme
Court has roundly rejected prior restraint.

857
00:53:57.779 --> 00:53:59.781
This is not
a First Amendment thing, man.

858
00:53:59.781 --> 00:54:02.993
Sir, if you don't calm down
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

859
00:54:03.118 --> 00:54:06.496
Lady, I got buddies
who died face down in the muck...

860
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.499
so that you and I can
enjoy this family restaurant!

861
00:54:09.583 --> 00:54:12.211
All right, I'm outta here.
Hey, Dude, don't go away, man.

862
00:54:12.294 --> 00:54:16.298
This affects all of us, man!
It's our basic freedoms!

863
00:54:21.303 --> 00:54:23.305
I'm stayin'.

864
00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:26.517
I'm finishing my coffee.

865
00:54:31.813 --> 00:54:34.399
Enjoyin' my coffee.

866
00:54:49.498 --> 00:54:52.000
<i>The Dude is not in.</i>

867
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.003
<i>Leave a message after the beep.
It takes a minute.</i>

868
00:54:55.003 --> 00:54:59.007
<i>Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty
Officer Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.</i>

869
00:54:59.007 --> 00:55:01.009
<i>We've recovered
your automobile.</i>

870
00:55:01.009 --> 00:55:04.680
<i>It can be claimed at the North Hollywood
Auto Circus there on Victory. 0m!</i>

871
00:55:04.805 --> 00:55:07.391
<i>Far out, man. Far fucking
on“ Their hours there are-</i>

872
00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:21.113
Hey!
This is a private residence, man.

873
00:55:29.705 --> 00:55:32.082
Oh. Nice marmot.

874
00:55:41.592 --> 00:55:44.803
Where is the money, Lebowski?
We wants the money, Lebowski!

875
00:55:52.311 --> 00:55:55.189
You think we are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?

876
00:55:55.314 --> 00:55:58.192
<i>We could do things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski. Ja.</i>

877
00:55:58.317 --> 00:56:01.403
- We believes in nothing.
- We believes in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing!

878
00:56:01.403 --> 00:56:05.490
<i>And tomorrow we come back and we
cut off yourjohnson. Excuse me?</i>

879
00:56:05.616 --> 00:56:07.993
I said,
we cut off your johnson!

880
00:56:08.118 --> 00:56:10.579
<i>Just think about that,
Lebowski.</i>

881
00:56:10.704 --> 00:56:12.206
Ah, your wiggly penis,
Lebowski.

882
00:56:12.206 --> 00:56:16.001
Ja. Maybe we stomp on it
and squish it.

883
00:56:23.509 --> 00:56:28.013
<i>It was discovered last night in Van Nuys
lodged against an abutment.</i>

884
00:56:28.013 --> 00:56:30.015
<i>Oh, man. Lodged where?</i>

885
00:56:30.015 --> 00:56:32.184
You're lucky she didn't get
chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

886
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:34.686
Oh, man! Must've been
a joyride situation.

887
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:37.689
They abandoned the vehicle
once they hit the retaining wall.

888
00:56:37.814 --> 00:56:40.692
Oh, my fucking briefcase, man!
It's not here! Shit!

889
00:56:40.817 --> 00:56:43.195
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

890
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.198
You gotta get in
on the other side.

891
00:56:46.281 --> 00:56:49.409
The side view was found
on the road by the ear.

892
00:56:50.786 --> 00:56:54.790
<i>You're lucky they left the tape
deck though, and the Creedenee.</i>

893
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.417
Oh, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

894
00:56:57.417 --> 00:57:00.504
<i>Uh, yeah. It's probably
a vagrant slept in the car.</i>

895
00:57:00.587 --> 00:57:03.382
Or maybe just used it as a toilet
and moved on.

896
00:57:03.507 --> 00:57:05.384
Hey, man,

897
00:57:05.509 --> 00:57:07.594
are you gonna find these guys?

898
00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:12.182
Or, you know, I mean- You got any
promising, uh, uh, leads or-

899
00:57:12.307 --> 00:57:14.184
Leads?

900
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:16.186
Yeah. Sure.

901
00:57:16.311 --> 00:57:19.314
I'll, uh, just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

902
00:57:19.314 --> 00:57:22.484
They, uh, got, uh, four more detectives
working on the case.

903
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:25.487
They got us working in shifts!

904
00:57:30.284 --> 00:57:32.286
Leads!

905
00:57:32.286 --> 00:57:34.997
<i>My only hope is
that the big Lebowski kills me...</i>

906
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.708
<i>before the Germans can
cut my dick ofl'.</i> Leads!

907
00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:41.503
Now, that is just ridiculous, Dude.
No one's going to out your dick off.

908
00:57:41.503 --> 00:57:44.214
Thank you, Walter. Not if I
have anything to say about it.

909
00:57:44.298 --> 00:57:47.593
Thank you, Walter. That makes
me feel very secure. Dude?

910
00:57:47.718 --> 00:57:50.679
That makes me feel very
warm inside, man. Uh, Dude?

911
00:57:50.679 --> 00:57:53.182
This whole fucking thing.

912
00:57:53.307 --> 00:57:56.518
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.

913
00:57:56.602 --> 00:57:59.688
Yeah. Fucking Germans. But
no, man, I got a, you know-

914
00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:02.107
Nothing changes.

915
00:58:02.191 --> 00:58:05.694
Fucking Nazis.
They were Nazis, Dude?

916
00:58:05.694 --> 00:58:08.405
Oh, come on, Donny. They
were threatening castration!

917
00:58:08.488 --> 00:58:10.490
Uh-huh? Are we gonna
split hairs here?

918
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:12.492
No.
Am I wrong?

919
00:58:12.492 --> 00:58:14.786
Well, he didn't- Man,
they were nihilists, man.

920
00:58:14.786 --> 00:58:17.789
Huh? They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

921
00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:20.709
Nihilists.

922
00:58:20.709 --> 00:58:22.711
Fuck me.

923
00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:27.090
I mean, say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism, Dude.

924
00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:29.510
At least it's an ethos. Yeah .

925
00:58:29.593 --> 00:58:32.179
And, also, let's not forget-
Iet'snot forget, Dude,

926
00:58:32.304 --> 00:58:35.098
that keeping wildlife-
um, an amphibious rodent...

927
00:58:35.182 --> 00:58:39.019
for, um, you know,
domestic-

928
00:58:39.019 --> 00:58:41.396
within the city-

929
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.608
That ain't legal either. What are
you, a fucking park ranger now?

930
00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:48.987
No! I'm just trying to- Who gives
a shit about the fucking marmot?

931
00:58:49.112 --> 00:58:52.407
We are sympathizing here, Dude.
Fuck sympathy.

932
00:58:52.491 --> 00:58:57.204
I don't need your fucking sympathy, man.
I need my fucking johnson.

933
00:58:57.204 --> 00:59:00.499
What do you need that for? You
have got to buck up, man!

934
00:59:00.582 --> 00:59:03.502
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

935
00:59:03.585 --> 00:59:06.213
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

936
00:59:08.799 --> 00:59:11.218
Fuck the tournament?

937
00:59:11.301 --> 00:59:14.304
Okay, Dude. I can see you don't
want to be cheered up here.

938
00:59:14.388 --> 00:59:17.391
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

939
00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:24.314
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Right, Dude.

940
00:59:26.608 --> 00:59:30.195
Friends like these, huh, Gary?
<i>That's right, Dude.</i>

941
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:59.016
<i>You got</i> a good sarsaparilla?
<i>Sioux City Sarsaparilla?</i>

942
00:59:59.099 --> 01:00:01.810
Yeah.
That's a good one.

943
01:00:03.896 --> 01:00:05.898
How're you doin' there.
Dude?

944
01:00:05.898 --> 01:00:08.609
Not too good, man.

945
01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:12.613
One of those days, huh?
Yeah.

946
01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:17.618
Well, a wiser fellow than myself
once said,

947
01:00:17.618 --> 01:00:20.913
"Sometimes you eat the bear, and-"

948
01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:22.998
Much obliged.

949
01:00:23.081 --> 01:00:27.294
"Sometimes the bear,
well, he eats you."

950
01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:30.797
Hmm. That some kind
of Eastern thing?

951
01:00:30.881 --> 01:00:33.217
Far from it.

952
01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:41.808
I like your style, Dude.

953
01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:46.897
Oh, well,
I dig your style too, man.

954
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.316
Got a whole cowboy thing going.

955
01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:54.404
Thank you.

956
01:00:54.488 --> 01:00:58.492
<i>There's just one thing, Dude.
Whats that?</i>

957
01:00:58.492 --> 01:01:01.912
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

958
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:08.502
What the fuck are you talking about?

959
01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:12.381
Okay, Dude.
Have it your way.

960
01:01:12.506 --> 01:01:15.801
Take 'er easy, Dude.

961
01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:17.803
Yeah. Thanks, man.

962
01:01:23.308 --> 01:01:25.310
Call for you, Dude.

963
01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:32.693
Hello? Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.

964
01:01:32.818 --> 01:01:36.113
Ah. Oh, yeah, no.
No, I haven't yet. Uh-

965
01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:38.907
I'd like to see you
immediately.

966
01:01:38.907 --> 01:01:40.909
Oh?

967
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.592
- So, you're Lebowski.
- Yeah.

968
01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:03.015
<i>Maude has told me all about you.
She'll be back in a minute. Sit down.</i>

969
01:02:04.308 --> 01:02:08.187
Do you <i>want a drink?</i>
Yeah, sure. White Russian.

970
01:02:08.187 --> 01:02:10.189
<i>The bar's over there.</i>

971
01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.987
So, what do you do, Lebowski?

972
01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:20.282
Who the fuck are you, man?

973
01:02:20.282 --> 01:02:23.994
Just a friend of Maudie's. Yeah?
The friend with the cleft asshole?

974
01:02:27.497 --> 01:02:31.210
What do you do?
Oh, nothing much.

975
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.212
<i>Hello, Jamey.</i>
Hello.

976
01:02:33.295 --> 01:02:36.882
Yeah. How are you?
Um, listen, Maude.

977
01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:40.719
I got to, uh,

978
01:02:40.802 --> 01:02:43.096
tender my resignation
or whatever...

979
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:47.601
because, uh, looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.

980
01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:50.521
She most certainly was not.

981
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:55.192
Hey, man, why don't you
fucking listen occasionally?

982
01:02:55.317 --> 01:02:58.111
You might learn something.
Now, I got-

983
01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:01.406
<i>Please don't call her
my mother.</i>

984
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.700
She's most definitely the perpetrator
and not the victim.

985
01:03:03.784 --> 01:03:06.578
I'm telling you,
I've got pretty definitive evidence.

986
01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:09.581
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.

987
01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:12.793
<i>Uli Cunckol?
Her costar in the beaver picture?</i>

988
01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:15.712
Beav- You mean vagina?

989
01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:18.090
I mean, you know the guy?

990
01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:22.010
I might have introduced them, for
all I know. Do you remember Uli?

991
01:03:22.094 --> 01:03:25.681
- Mmm. - He's a musician. Used
to have a group, Autobahn.

992
01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:30.185
Look in my L.P.'s. They released
one album in the late '703.

993
01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:33.605
<i>Their music is sort of a-
ugh, techno pop.</i>

994
01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:36.984
<i>So he's pretending to be the abductor?</i>
Well <i>,</i> yeah .

995
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:40.487
<i>Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap
someone you're acquainted with.</i>

996
01:03:40.612 --> 01:03:44.199
The whole idea is that the hostage
can't identify you after you've let them go.

997
01:03:44.283 --> 01:03:46.285
Well, I know that.

998
01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:53.709
What the fuck is with this guy?
Who is he?

999
01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:57.588
<i>Knox Harrington,
the video artist.</i>

1000
01:03:57.713 --> 01:04:00.507
So, UN has the money.

1001
01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:03.385
Well, uh, no, not exactly.

1002
01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:06.680
Uh, this is a very complicated case,
Maude.

1003
01:04:06.805 --> 01:04:10.100
<i>You know, a lot of ins, a lot of outs,
a lot of what-have-yous...</i>

1004
01:04:10.184 --> 01:04:13.520
<i>and a lot of strands
to keep in my head, man.</i>

1005
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.981
<i>You know,</i> a <i>lot of strands in
the old Duder's head.</i> Hello?

1006
01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:20.611
- If U“ doesn't have it, then who does?
- It's Sandra about the Biennale.

1007
01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:24.114
Uh, look. I have to take this.
Do you still have that doctor's number?

1008
01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:27.701
Oh, no, really, it's not even bruised
anymore. Oh, please, Jem'e y.

1009
01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:30.913
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed aftereffects.

1010
01:04:30.913 --> 01:04:33.916
Aftereffects?

1011
01:05:04.404 --> 01:05:07.699
Could you slide your shorts down,
Mr. Lebowski, please?

1012
01:05:07.699 --> 01:05:11.203
Mmm? No, no, man.
She hit me right here.

1013
01:05:11.286 --> 01:05:15.290
<i>I understand. Could you slide
your shorts down, please?</i>

1014
01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:46.697
Keeping mighty cool.

1015
01:06:02.421 --> 01:06:05.299
Aah! Aah!

1016
01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:51.113
He lives in North Hollywood on Redford,
near the In-N-Out Burger.

1017
01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:53.407
No, the In-N-Out Burger's
on Camrose.

1018
01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:55.701
Near the In-N-Out Burger. Those
are good burgers, Walter.

1019
01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:58.787
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
The kid is in the ninth grade, Dude.

1020
01:07:58.912 --> 01:08:01.498
And his father is- Are
you ready for this? Hmm.

1021
01:08:01.582 --> 01:08:05.002
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

1022
01:08:05.002 --> 01:08:07.004
Who the fuck is that?
Huh?

1023
01:08:07.087 --> 01:08:09.798
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Who the fu-

1024
01:08:09.882 --> 01:08:12.801
Have you ever heard of a little show
celledanded, Dude? Yes, yes, I-

1025
01:08:12.885 --> 01:08:15.387
All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek.

1026
01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:17.806
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

1027
01:08:17.806 --> 01:08:22.394
Fuckin' Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude. Huh.

1028
01:08:22.394 --> 01:08:24.813
The bulk of the series.
Oh.

1029
01:08:24.897 --> 01:08:27.482
Not exactly a lightweight.
No.

1030
01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:31.195
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Huh.

1031
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.114
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you.

1032
01:08:34.114 --> 01:08:37.117
- We'll brace the kid. Should be a pushover.
- We'll be near the In-N-Out Burger.

1033
01:08:37.201 --> 01:08:40.495
Shut the fuck up, Donny!
<i>Shh!</i>

1034
01:08:40.621 --> 01:08:43.790
We'll go out there, brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

1035
01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:48.295
We'll get that fucking million dollars
back, if he hasn't spent it already.

1036
01:08:48.295 --> 01:08:50.380
A million fucking clams.

1037
01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:54.092
And, yes, we'll be near
the, uh- In-N-Out.

1038
01:08:54.218 --> 01:08:56.678
Some burgers, some beers.
Hey. Shh. Shh.

1039
01:08:56.803 --> 01:08:58.805
A few laughs.

1040
01:09:00.682 --> 01:09:04.811
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1041
01:09:15.489 --> 01:09:18.909
Oh, fuck me, man.

1042
01:09:18.992 --> 01:09:21.286
<i>That kid's already spent
all the money, man.</i>

1043
01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:23.705
<i>New Vane?
Harem, Dude.</i>

1044
01:09:23.705 --> 01:09:28.919
I'd say he still has $960,000, $970,000
left, depending on the options.

1045
01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:31.004
Wait in the car, Donny.

1046
01:09:35.008 --> 01:09:37.010
<i>Yes?</i>
Pilar?

1047
01:09:38.178 --> 01:09:42.808
<i>My name is Waiter Sobchak. This is
my associate, Jeffrey Lebowski.</i>

1048
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:46.019
<i>Uh, we came to talk
about little Larry.</i>

1049
01:09:46.103 --> 01:09:48.188
May we come in?
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

1050
01:09:48.313 --> 01:09:50.190
Thank you.

1051
01:09:53.902 --> 01:09:55.904
That's him, Dude.

1052
01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:05.581
And a good day to you, sir!

1053
01:10:05.706 --> 01:10:07.708
Uh, sit down, please.

1054
01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:15.507
Larry, sweetie,
the man is here!

1055
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:19.011
Is he-
Does he still write?

1056
01:10:19.094 --> 01:10:22.181
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

1057
01:10:22.306 --> 01:10:25.017
Uh-huh.

1058
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.103
Uh, sir, I just want to say...

1059
01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:31.899
that we're both,
on a personal level,

1060
01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:33.901
really enormous fans.

1061
01:10:33.984 --> 01:10:37.112
<i>Branded,
especially the early episodes,</i>

1062
01:10:37.112 --> 01:10:39.698
was truly a source
of inspiration.

1063
01:10:39.781 --> 01:10:42.409
<i>Sweet pea, sit down.
This man is the police.</i>

1064
01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:45.913
Oh, no, ma'am. We didn't want to give the
impression that we were police, exactly.

1065
01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:48.498
We're hoping it won't be
necessary to cell the police.

1066
01:10:48.582 --> 01:10:51.210
<i>But that's up
to little Larry here.</i>

1067
01:10:51.293 --> 01:10:53.295
Isn't it, Larry?

1068
01:11:03.805 --> 01:11:05.807
Is this your homework, Larry?

1069
01:11:08.185 --> 01:11:10.312
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, <i>man,</i> it-

1070
01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:14.691
Dude. Please? Is this your homework, Larry?
Just ask him about the ear, man.

1071
01:11:14.816 --> 01:11:18.487
Is this yours. Larry? Is this your homework,
Larry? Is that your car out front?

1072
01:11:18.487 --> 01:11:21.198
Is this your homework, Larry? We
know it's his fucking homework!

1073
01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:23.700
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

1074
01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:26.787
<i>Look, Larry, have you
ever heard of Vietnam?</i>

1075
01:11:26.912 --> 01:11:29.498
For Christ's sake, Walter. You are
entering a world of pain, son.

1076
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:32.292
We know that this is your homework.
We know that you stole the car.

1077
01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:34.711
And the fucking money.
And the fucking money!

1078
01:11:34.795 --> 01:11:38.215
And we know that this is your homework!
We're gonna cut your dick off.

1079
01:11:38.215 --> 01:11:40.217
You're killing your father, Larry.

1080
01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:46.306
All right.
This is pointless.

1081
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:49.393
Okay? Time for plan "B."

1082
01:11:51.019 --> 01:11:54.481
You might want to watch
out that front window, Larry.

1083
01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:59.194
Son, this is what happens
when you fuck a stranger in the ass!

1084
01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:04.908
A little language problem here.
Little prick's stonewalling me.

1085
01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:07.995
Walter.

1086
01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.080
Wh-What are you doing, man?

1087
01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.418
What are you doing?

1088
01:12:15.919 --> 01:12:19.590
Here you 90, Larry.
You see what happens?

1089
01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:22.384
You see what happens, Larry?

1090
01:12:22.509 --> 01:12:24.219
<i>You see what happens?
0h,</i> great.

1091
01:12:24.303 --> 01:12:28.015
This is what happens when you fuck
a stranger in the ass, Larry.

1092
01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:34.605
<i>This is what happens, Lany.
You see what happens, Larry?</i>

1093
01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:38.984
You see what happens when you fuck a
stranger in the ass? This is what happens!

1094
01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:41.695
<i>You see what happens, Larry?</i>

1095
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.198
<i>You see what happens, Larry?</i>

1096
01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:47.701
Do you see what happens, Larry,
when you fuck a stranger in the ass?

1097
01:12:49.203 --> 01:12:52.706
This is what happens, Larry!
This is what happens, Larry!

1098
01:12:52.789 --> 01:12:55.501
- My <i>car!</i> My <i>baby!
-</i> This is what happens, Larry!

1099
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:57.503
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger-

1100
01:12:57.586 --> 01:13:00.214
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Stop it! Oh, hey!

1101
01:13:00.297 --> 01:13:02.799
Hey, man. I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1102
01:13:02.799 --> 01:13:06.386
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm sorry!
<i>- I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1103
01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:09.097
I just bought the fucking car last week!
Come on, man.

1104
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:13.018
- I'll kill your fucking car, man!
- No, no. Hey, hey, that's not his! Hey!

1105
01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:15.687
- Goddamn it!
- Whoa! Oh, no!

1106
01:13:15.812 --> 01:13:17.898
<i>Fuck you!
Man. No.</i>

1107
01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:19.983
<i>You like that? Fuck you!</i>

1108
01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:23.904
I'll kill your fucking car!
No. No, no. No.

1109
01:13:23.987 --> 01:13:25.906
I'll kill your fucking car!

1110
01:13:46.301 --> 01:13:48.095
I accept your apology.

1111
01:13:49.805 --> 01:13:53.809
No, I just- I just want to handle it
by myself from now on.

1112
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:56.812
No. No. No!

1113
01:13:56.895 --> 01:13:59.815
That has nothing to do with it.

1114
01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:03.110
Yes, the car made it home.
You're calling me at home.

1115
01:14:04.987 --> 01:14:09.700
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack!

1116
01:14:11.785 --> 01:14:13.787
Well, that's your perception.

1117
01:14:15.706 --> 01:14:18.208
You know, Walter, you're right.

1118
01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:22.796
There is an unspoken message here.
It's, "Fuck you! Leave me the fuck alone!"

1119
01:14:25.716 --> 01:14:27.801
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1120
01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:48.780
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.
Jackie Treahom wants to see you.

1121
01:14:48.906 --> 01:14:52.784
Jackie Treehom knows which
Lebowski you are, Lebowski.

1122
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:56.788
Jackie Treehom wants to see the dead beat
Lebowski . You're not dealing with morons here.

1123
01:15:44.503 --> 01:15:47.506
Hello, Dude.
Thanks for coming.

1124
01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:49.800
I'm Jackie Treehom.

1125
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.805
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1126
01:15:54.888 --> 01:15:57.015
Completely unspoiled.

1127
01:15:57.099 --> 01:16:00.519
What's your drink, Dude?
A White Russian. Thanks.

1128
01:16:00.519 --> 01:16:02.521
White Russian.

1129
01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:06.817
How's the smut business, Jackie?
<i>I wouldn't know, Dude.</i>

1130
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:10.195
Ideal in publishing, entertainment,

1131
01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:12.489
<i>political advocacy.</i>

1132
01:16:12.489 --> 01:16:15.701
<i>Ah, which one'sLogjammin'?
Yes, regrettably, it's true.</i>

1133
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:18.787
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1134
01:16:18.912 --> 01:16:21.206
It's video, Dude.

1135
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:23.584
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1136
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:26.295
we can't afford to invest
in little extras like story,

1137
01:16:27.588 --> 01:16:30.591
production value, feelings.

1138
01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:35.596
You know, people forget
that the brain...

1139
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.890
is the biggest erogenous zone.

1140
01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:42.311
On you maybe. Of course, you have
to take the good with the bad.

1141
01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:47.316
New technology permits us to do very exciting
things in interactive erotic software.

1142
01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:51.987
Wave of the future, Dude.
One hundred percent electronic.

1143
01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:55.908
Hmm. Well,
I still jerk off manually.

1144
01:16:57.701 --> 01:17:02.206
Of course you do. I can see you're
anxious for me to get to the point.

1145
01:17:02.289 --> 01:17:06.293
Well, here it is, Dude.
Where's Bunny?

1146
01:17:06.293 --> 01:17:09.588
Well, I thought you might know that, man.
Why <i>would</i> I?

1147
01:17:09.713 --> 01:17:13.592
She only ran off to get away
from that rather sizable debt to me.

1148
01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:16.220
No, she didn't run off.
She's been, um-

1149
01:17:16.303 --> 01:17:18.305
<i>I heard that kidnapping story,
so save it.</i>

1150
01:17:18.388 --> 01:17:22.017
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude.

1151
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.103
And I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1152
01:17:25.187 --> 01:17:27.105
That's your business.

1153
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:30.317
All I'm saying is, I want mine.

1154
01:17:30.317 --> 01:17:32.319
Yeah, right.

1155
01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:37.616
I mean, there are a lot of, um, facets
to this, a lot of interested parties.

1156
01:17:37.699 --> 01:17:39.618
Excuse me.

1157
01:17:44.706 --> 01:17:48.585
Yeah? Oh, yeah?

1158
01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:50.379
<i>Where is that?</i>

1159
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.801
<i>All right. Yeah.</i>

1160
01:17:58.595 --> 01:18:00.681
Excuse me.

1161
01:18:26.707 --> 01:18:29.209
Oh.

1162
01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:39.386
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.

1163
01:18:39.511 --> 01:18:42.514
So. uh, if I, uh,

1164
01:18:42.598 --> 01:18:45.601
can find your money,

1165
01:18:45.601 --> 01:18:48.020
what's in it for the Dude?

1166
01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.898
Of course, there's that to discuss.
You want a refill?

1167
01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:55.194
- Yeah. does the pope shit in the woods?
- Ten percent finder's fee. That all right?

1168
01:18:55.319 --> 01:18:57.779
Mmm. Okay. Done, Jackie.

1169
01:18:57.905 --> 01:19:00.490
I dig the way
you do business, man.

1170
01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:04.786
<i>Your money is being held
by a kid named Larry Sellers.</i>

1171
01:19:04.912 --> 01:19:07.581
He lives in North Hollywood
on Redford,

1172
01:19:07.706 --> 01:19:10.792
uh, by the In-N-Out Burger.

1173
01:19:10.918 --> 01:19:13.212
Okay.
Fuckin' brat.

1174
01:19:13.212 --> 01:19:17.382
<i>But I'm sum your goons can get it off him.
I mean, he's 15.</i>

1175
01:19:19.218 --> 01:19:21.094
Flunking social studies.

1176
01:19:24.389 --> 01:19:27.392
So, if you could just, uh,

1177
01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:31.813
write me a check
for my 10% of half a million,

1178
01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:35.484
five grand,
I'll go out and mingle.

1179
01:19:38.987 --> 01:19:42.783
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

1180
01:19:42.908 --> 01:19:45.202
Fifteen-year-old kid.

1181
01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:48.497
<i>Is this some sort of a joke?</i>

1182
01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.916
No. No joke.

1183
01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:54.586
<i>No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.</i>

1184
01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:56.588
Hi, fellas.

1185
01:19:58.799 --> 01:20:00.801
Kid just wanted a car.

1186
01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:07.516
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1187
01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:10.894
<i>Not greedy.</i>

1188
01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:13.313
It really...

1189
01:20:13.397 --> 01:20:15.399
tied the room together.

1190
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:21.697
<i>Darkness washed over the Dude.</i>

1191
01:20:21.697 --> 01:20:27.119
<i>Darker than a black steer's tokus
on a moonless prairie night.</i>

1192
01:20:27.119 --> 01:20:29.496
<i>There was no bottom.</i>

1193
01:23:29.593 --> 01:23:32.804
Huh?

1194
01:24:24.481 --> 01:24:27.609
Hey! Whoa!

1195
01:24:37.995 --> 01:24:40.706
Is this your only I.D.?

1196
01:24:40.789 --> 01:24:43.584
<i>I know my rights, man.</i>

1197
01:24:45.502 --> 01:24:47.880
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

1198
01:24:48.005 --> 01:24:51.592
I want a fucking lawyer, man.
I want...

1199
01:24:51.717 --> 01:24:54.595
Bill Kunstler, man,

1200
01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.181
or Ron Kubbie.

1201
01:24:57.181 --> 01:25:00.517
<i>Mr. Treehom tells us
that he had to eject you...</i>

1202
01:25:00.601 --> 01:25:02.603
from his garden party,

1203
01:25:02.603 --> 01:25:04.813
that you were drunk and abusive.

1204
01:25:04.897 --> 01:25:08.108
Mr. Treehom treats objects...

1205
01:25:08.192 --> 01:25:10.194
like woman, man.

1206
01:25:10.194 --> 01:25:13.697
Mr. Treehom draws
a lot of water in this town.

1207
01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.200
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1208
01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:18.994
Now, we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1209
01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:21.496
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1210
01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:24.416
So let me make something plain.

1211
01:25:24.499 --> 01:25:29.296
I don't like you sucking around,
bothering our citizens, Lebowski.

1212
01:25:29.379 --> 01:25:31.590
I don't like your jerk-off name.

1213
01:25:31.715 --> 01:25:34.718
I don't like your jerk-off face.
I don't like your jerk-off behavior.

1214
01:25:34.801 --> 01:25:38.180
And I don't like you, jerk-off.

1215
01:25:41.016 --> 01:25:43.101
Do I make myself clear?

1216
01:25:46.313 --> 01:25:48.398
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1217
01:25:50.901 --> 01:25:52.819
Owl Fuckin' fascist!

1218
01:25:52.903 --> 01:25:56.782
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

1219
01:25:56.907 --> 01:25:59.785
Owl
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

1220
01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:02.913
<i>Keep your ugly fucking
goldbricking</i> ass...

1221
01:26:02.996 --> 01:26:05.207
out of my beach community.

1222
01:26:17.886 --> 01:26:21.098
Jesus, man.
Could you change the channel?

1223
01:26:21.098 --> 01:26:24.184
Fuck you, man! If you don't like my
fucking music, get your own fucking cab!

1224
01:26:24.184 --> 01:26:27.187
<i>I</i> had a <i>really rough-</i> I'll pull off
to the side and kick your ass out.

1225
01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:32.818
Man, come on. I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles, man.

1226
01:26:39.908 --> 01:26:43.912
Out of my fucking cab!
Out- Hey. Hey, man!

1227
01:26:43.912 --> 01:26:46.415
Man! Man, hey!

1228
01:26:46.415 --> 01:26:49.209
What the-

1229
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:31.585
<i>Oh, Jesus!</i>

1230
01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:54.316
- Jeffrey.
- Maude?

1231
01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:56.818
Love me.

1232
01:27:57.986 --> 01:27:59.905
Uh, that's my robe.

1233
01:28:01.281 --> 01:28:04.201
<i>Tell me about yourself, Jeffrey.</i>

1234
01:28:04.201 --> 01:28:06.495
<i>Um, not much to tell.</i>

1235
01:28:06.495 --> 01:28:09.498


1236
01:28:09.581 --> 01:28:13.418
I was, uh. one of the authors
of the Port Huron Statement-

1237
01:28:13.502 --> 01:28:16.713
uh, the original
Port Huron Statement.

1238
01:28:16.713 --> 01:28:21.093
Uh-huh. Not the
compromised second draft.

1239
01:28:23.178 --> 01:28:25.889
Uh, and then I, uh- Hmm.

1240
01:28:25.889 --> 01:28:28.517
You ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Hmm.

1241
01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.311
That was me.

1242
01:28:31.395 --> 01:28:35.899
Uh, and there were six other guys.

1243
01:28:35.983 --> 01:28:40.320
Uh, and then, uh,
the music business, briefly.

1244
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.490
Oh? Yeah. Roadie for Metallica.

1245
01:28:43.615 --> 01:28:46.618
Oh.
Speed of Sound Tour.

1246
01:28:46.702 --> 01:28:48.620
Mm-hmm.

1247
01:28:48.704 --> 01:28:51.081
Bunch of assholes.

1248
01:28:51.206 --> 01:28:54.293
Uh, and then, uh, you know,
little of this, little of that.

1249
01:28:54.418 --> 01:28:59.381
Um, my career's slowed down
a little lately.

1250
01:28:59.506 --> 01:29:03.385
What do you do for-
for recreation?

1251
01:29:03.385 --> 01:29:05.387
Well, the usual.

1252
01:29:05.387 --> 01:29:08.015
Bowl, drive around...

1253
01:29:08.098 --> 01:29:11.810
and the occasional
acid flashback.

1254
01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.816
Oh!

1255
01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:20.319
<i>What happened to your house?</i>

1256
01:29:20.402 --> 01:29:22.696
<i>Oh, Jackie Treehom
trashed the place.</i>

1257
01:29:22.779 --> 01:29:25.699
<i>He thought I had
your father's money.</i>

1258
01:29:25.699 --> 01:29:28.285
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1259
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:31.413
Cocktail?
<i>No, thanks.</i>

1260
01:29:31.496 --> 01:29:34.583
It's not my father's money.
It's the foundation's.

1261
01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:37.920
Why did he think you have it?
And who does?

1262
01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.216
On, Larry Sellers, this high school kid.
Real fuckin' brat.

1263
01:29:42.299 --> 01:29:46.220
<i>You know, this is
a very complicated case, Maude.</i>

1264
01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:48.180
A lot of ins, a lot of outs.

1265
01:29:48.305 --> 01:29:53.185
Uh, you know, fortunately, I'm adhering
to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen...

1266
01:29:53.185 --> 01:29:55.812
to keep my mind, you know-
limber,

1267
01:29:55.896 --> 01:29:59.399
and I'm very fucking close
to your father's money.

1268
01:29:59.483 --> 01:30:03.612
I keep telling you it's the foundation's
money. Father doesn't have any.

1269
01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:07.699
Hmm. What are you talking about?
He's fucking loaded.

1270
01:30:07.783 --> 01:30:10.786
<i>No, no.
The wealth is all mother's.</i>

1271
01:30:10.911 --> 01:30:13.205
No, he runs stuff.
Uh-You know.

1272
01:30:13.205 --> 01:30:16.708
We did let him run one of the companies
briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.

1273
01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:19.711
<i>0h, he's, uh. you know- No, he helps
administer the charities now,</i>

1274
01:30:19.795 --> 01:30:23.090
and I- I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1275
01:30:23.215 --> 01:30:26.802
He has no money of his own.
I know how he likes to present himself.

1276
01:30:26.885 --> 01:30:29.680
Father's weakness is vanity,
hence the slut.

1277
01:30:29.805 --> 01:30:32.099
Uh-

1278
01:30:32.182 --> 01:30:35.394
Do you think he, uh-

1279
01:30:35.519 --> 01:30:37.521
What is that, yoga?

1280
01:30:37.604 --> 01:30:40.983
It increases the chances
of conception.

1281
01:30:41.108 --> 01:30:42.985
Increases-

1282
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:47.197
Well, yes. What did you think
this was all about? Fun and games?

1283
01:30:47.281 --> 01:30:49.908
<i>I want a child.</i>

1284
01:30:49.992 --> 01:30:51.994
Okay, yeah, okay.

1285
01:30:51.994 --> 01:30:55.581
But let me- Let me explain
something about the Dude.

1286
01:30:55.581 --> 01:30:58.417
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

1287
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:02.087
In fact, I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see socially...

1288
01:31:02.212 --> 01:31:05.299
or who will have any interest
in raising the child himself.

1289
01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:09.011
Oh. So, that doctor, uh-

1290
01:31:09.094 --> 01:31:11.597
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>0h.</i>

1291
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.391
Now, what happened to your face?

1292
01:31:14.391 --> 01:31:16.685
Did Jackie Treehom
do that as well?

1293
01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:19.980
No, uh, it was
the chief of police of Malibu.

1294
01:31:20.105 --> 01:31:22.107
A real reactionary.

1295
01:31:22.191 --> 01:31:24.193
So, your father-

1296
01:31:25.903 --> 01:31:29.198
- Oh, yeah, I get it. Yeah. Yeah.
- What?

1297
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:33.493
Oh, man. My thinking about this case
has become very uptight.

1298
01:31:33.619 --> 01:31:35.621
Yeah.

1299
01:31:35.704 --> 01:31:37.414
<i>Your father.</i>

1300
01:31:37.497 --> 01:31:41.084
<i>Jeffrey, what are you talking about?</i>

1301
01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:43.295
Jeffrey!

1302
01:31:43.378 --> 01:31:46.381
Walter, if you're there,
pick up the fuckin' phone, man.

1303
01:31:46.507 --> 01:31:48.717
Come on, Walter.

1304
01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.803
Pick it up, man. This is an emergency.
Dude? Dude?

1305
01:31:51.803 --> 01:31:55.891
Yeah. Listen, Walter. I'm at my place.
I need you to come pick me up.

1306
01:31:56.016 --> 01:31:58.519
I can't drive, Dude.
It'ssnav <i>shabbos.</i> What?

1307
01:31:58.519 --> 01:32:00.521
<i>Erev shabbos.</i>
What?

1308
01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:03.106
<i>Enav shabbos.</i> I can't drive.
Man!

1309
01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:05.984
I'm not even supposed to pick up the
phone unless it's an emergency.

1310
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:10.906
This is a fuckin' emergency! I understand.
That's why I picked up the phone.

1311
01:32:10.989 --> 01:32:13.784
Walter, you fuck!
We gotta go to Pasadena, man.

1312
01:32:13.909 --> 01:32:16.495
Come pick me up
or I'm off the fuckin' bowling team.

1313
01:32:32.886 --> 01:32:36.014
Get out of that fucking ear, man!

1314
01:32:36.098 --> 01:32:38.308
<i>Get out of that fucking car!</i>

1315
01:32:38.392 --> 01:32:41.186
Get the fuck
out of the car, man.

1316
01:32:42.604 --> 01:32:44.815
Get out of the fucking-

1317
01:32:44.898 --> 01:32:46.984
Who the fuck are you, man?
Easy, man!

1318
01:32:47.109 --> 01:32:50.904
Relax, man.
No physical harm intended.

1319
01:32:50.988 --> 01:32:54.283
Who the fuck are you? Why you
following me around? Okay. Okay.

1320
01:32:54.408 --> 01:32:57.619
Come on, fuckhead! Relax, man.
I'm a brother shamus.

1321
01:32:57.703 --> 01:33:02.583
Brother Shamus?
Like an Irish monk?

1322
01:33:02.708 --> 01:33:05.210
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1323
01:33:05.294 --> 01:33:09.214
My name is Da Fino.
I'm a private snoop, like you, man.

1324
01:33:09.298 --> 01:33:12.593
What?
A dick, man!

1325
01:33:12.718 --> 01:33:15.679
And let me tell you something.
I dig your work.

1326
01:33:15.804 --> 01:33:19.683
Playing one side against the other, in
bed with everybody. Fabulous stuff, man.

1327
01:33:19.683 --> 01:33:21.810
I'm not-
Fuck it, man.

1328
01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:24.479
Just stay away
from my fucking lady friend.

1329
01:33:24.605 --> 01:33:26.982
Hey, I'm not messing
with your special lady.

1330
01:33:26.982 --> 01:33:29.484
She's not my special lady.
She's my fucking lady friend.

1331
01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:32.404
I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Hey, man. I'm not-

1332
01:33:32.487 --> 01:33:34.907
Who are you working for?
Lebowski?

1333
01:33:34.907 --> 01:33:36.909
Huh? Jackie Treehom?

1334
01:33:38.118 --> 01:33:40.287
The Kneutsons.

1335
01:33:40.412 --> 01:33:43.582
The-Who-Who the fuck
are the Kneutsons?

1336
01:33:43.707 --> 01:33:47.211
Th-The Kneutsons.
Uh, it's a wandering daughter job.

1337
01:33:47.294 --> 01:33:51.215
Ah. Bunny Lebowski, man.

1338
01:33:51.298 --> 01:33:54.092
Her real name is Fawn Kneutson.

1339
01:33:54.092 --> 01:33:56.887
Her parents want her back, see?

1340
01:33:57.012 --> 01:33:59.389
Jesus fucking Christ.

1341
01:33:59.389 --> 01:34:02.017
<i>Crazy, huh?
Ran away about a year ago.</i>

1342
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:05.979
<i>The Kneutsons told me I should
show her this when I found her.</i>

1343
01:34:06.104 --> 01:34:09.691
It's the family farm.
It's outside Moorhead, Minnesota.

1344
01:34:09.816 --> 01:34:12.694
They think it'll make her homesick.
Oh, boy.

1345
01:34:12.819 --> 01:34:17.407
How are you gonna keep 'em down on the
farm once they've seen Karl Hungus?

1346
01:34:17.491 --> 01:34:19.993
She's been kidnapped, Be Fine.
Oh, man. That's terrible.

1347
01:34:20.118 --> 01:34:22.913
Or I don't know. Maybe not.
But she's definitely not around.

1348
01:34:22.996 --> 01:34:26.917
Hey, uh, maybe you and me
could pool our resources,

1349
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.294
trade information.

1350
01:34:29.294 --> 01:34:31.588
Professional courtesy?

1351
01:34:31.588 --> 01:34:35.008
Compeers. You know what I mean?
Yeah, I get it. Fuck off, Be Fine.

1352
01:34:35.092 --> 01:34:37.594
And stay away from my special-

1353
01:34:37.719 --> 01:34:40.597
from my fucking lady friend, man!

1354
01:34:42.307 --> 01:34:45.102
Uh, the Iingonberry
pancake.

1355
01:34:47.896 --> 01:34:51.483
Lingonberry pancakes.

1356
01:34:55.195 --> 01:34:57.781
Three pigs in blankets.

1357
01:35:00.492 --> 01:35:02.995
<i>Eh?</i>

1358
01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.080
<i>She has Iingonbeny
pancakes.</i>

1359
01:35:13.213 --> 01:35:17.384
<i>I mean, we totally fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his payoff.</i>

1360
01:35:17.384 --> 01:35:19.386
We got the kidnappers all pissed off.

1361
01:35:19.511 --> 01:35:23.390
And Lebowski, you know, he yelled at me
a lot, but he didn't do anything, huh?

1362
01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:26.602
Well, sometimes it's a cathartic, uh-
No, no.

1363
01:35:26.685 --> 01:35:30.814
I'm saying that if he knows I'm a fuckup, why does
he leave me in charge of getting his wife back?

1364
01:35:30.898 --> 01:35:34.484
<i>Because he doesn't
fucking want her back, man.</i>

1365
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:37.905
<i>He's had enough.
He no longer digs her. It's all a show.</i>

1366
01:35:37.905 --> 01:35:42.201
Okay, but then why doesn't he
give a shit about his million bucks?

1367
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:45.120
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1368
01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.081
<i>but he never asked for it back.</i>

1369
01:35:48.207 --> 01:35:51.001
<i>The million bucks
was never in the briefcase.</i>

1370
01:35:51.084 --> 01:35:54.004
<i>The briefcase was fucking empty, man.</i>

1371
01:35:54.004 --> 01:35:57.007
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1372
01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:59.593
<i>You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.</i>

1373
01:35:59.718 --> 01:36:02.513
<i>Okay, but how does all this
add up to an emergency?</i>

1374
01:36:02.596 --> 01:36:07.392
- Huh? - I'm saying, I see what you're
getting at, Dude. He kept the money.

1375
01:36:07.518 --> 01:36:09.603
My point is-

1376
01:36:09.603 --> 01:36:12.814
Here we are-
It'shabbos, the Sabbath,

1377
01:36:12.814 --> 01:36:16.818
which I'm allowed to break
only if it's a matter of life or death.

1378
01:36:16.902 --> 01:36:19.780
Will you come off it, Walter?
You're not even fucking Jewish, man.

1379
01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.491
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1380
01:36:22.616 --> 01:36:25.285
Man, you're fucking Polish Catholic!
<i>What</i> the <i>flick</i> are you <i>talking about?</i>

1381
01:36:25.202 --> 01:36:28.205
<i>I converted when I married Cynthia.</i>
Come <i>on, Dude.</i> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1382
01:36:28.288 --> 01:36:32.084
- Yoda-row this. - And five fucking
years ago, you were divorced.

1383
01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:35.212
So what are you saying? When you get
divorced, you turn in your library card?

1384
01:36:35.295 --> 01:36:38.715
You get a new license? You stop being
Jewish? This is the drive <i>way.</i>

1385
01:36:38.799 --> 01:36:41.718
Jewish as fucking Tevye.
<i>Man.</i>

1386
01:36:41.802 --> 01:36:45.305
You know, I-it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

1387
01:36:45.305 --> 01:36:48.684
Man, taking care of her fucking dog.
going to her fucking synagogue.

1388
01:36:48.809 --> 01:36:50.894
You're living in the fucking past.

1389
01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:54.481
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition,
from Moses to Sandy Koufax.

1390
01:36:54.606 --> 01:36:58.819
You're goddamn right
I'm living in the fucking past! I've-

1391
01:36:58.902 --> 01:37:02.281
Jesus.
What the hell happened?

1392
01:37:12.583 --> 01:37:15.919
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1393
01:37:16.003 --> 01:37:18.005
Let's go. Fuck it.

1394
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:22.217
Ah!

1395
01:37:22.301 --> 01:37:25.596
<i>Wham</i> was she, man <i>?</i> Visiting
friends of hers in Palm Springs.

1396
01:37:25.679 --> 01:37:28.390
She just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

1397
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:30.893
Well, I guess the fucking nihilists
knew where she was.

1398
01:37:31.018 --> 01:37:33.103
Jesus, Dude. She never
even kidnapped herself.

1399
01:37:33.187 --> 01:37:36.481
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am I? I'm a fucking veteran.

1400
01:37:36.607 --> 01:37:38.483
Come on!
That's who I am.

1401
01:37:38.609 --> 01:37:40.194
You shouldn't go in there, Dude.
He's very angry.

1402
01:37:41.612 --> 01:37:43.906
So, man-

1403
01:37:43.906 --> 01:37:48.493
80? She's back,
no thanks to you.

1404
01:37:48.619 --> 01:37:50.621
Where's the fuckin' money,
Lebowski?

1405
01:37:50.621 --> 01:37:53.415
A million bucks from fuckin'
needy little Urban Achievers!

1406
01:37:53.498 --> 01:37:55.417
Walter-
You are scum, man!

1407
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:58.086
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am I? Who am I?

1408
01:37:58.086 --> 01:38:01.089
Walter. Walter. I'm the guy that's gonna
kick your phony goldbrickin' ass!

1409
01:38:01.215 --> 01:38:05.093
Man, we know the briefcase was fucking empty. We
know you kept the million bucks for yourself.

1410
01:38:05.093 --> 01:38:10.015
You have your story, I have mine. I say I
entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.

1411
01:38:10.098 --> 01:38:13.393
As if we would ever dream
of taking your bullshit money!

1412
01:38:13.519 --> 01:38:17.314
You thought that Bunny had been kidnapped,
and you were fucking glad, man.

1413
01:38:17.314 --> 01:38:19.608
<i>You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.</i>

1414
01:38:19.691 --> 01:38:23.195
All you needed was a sap to pin it on.
You just met me.

1415
01:38:23.195 --> 01:38:25.989
You f-
You... human paraquat!

1416
01:38:25.989 --> 01:38:29.284
<i>You figured, “Oh, here's a bar.
you know, a deadbeat,</i>

1417
01:38:29.284 --> 01:38:31.995
somebody the square community
won't give a shit about."

1418
01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:35.207
Well, aren't ya?

1419
01:38:35.207 --> 01:38:39.211
- Well, yeah, but-
- Get out, both of you.

1420
01:38:39.294 --> 01:38:42.714
Look at that fucking phony, Dude,
pretending to be a fucking millionaire.

1421
01:38:42.798 --> 01:38:44.800
Out of this house now, you bums!

1422
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.802
Let me tell you
something else.

1423
01:38:46.802 --> 01:38:51.682
I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,
and this guy's a fake.

1424
01:38:51.807 --> 01:38:53.892
<i>A fucking goldbn'cker: Stay away from <i>me,</i> mister!

1425
01:38:54.017 --> 01:38:56.103
This guy fuckin' walks.

1426
01:38:56.186 --> 01:38:58.981
- I've never been more certain of anything
in my life. - You stay away from me!

1427
01:38:59.106 --> 01:39:02.192
- For Christ's sake, man! He's a cripple. - I've never
been more certain of anything in my fucking life.

1428
01:39:02.192 --> 01:39:04.403
Stay away from me, I said! Get
away from me! Come on. Come on.

1429
01:39:04.486 --> 01:39:07.197
Put him down, man!

1430
01:39:07.197 --> 01:39:11.201
Yeah, I'll put him down, Dude.
WalklAchtung, baby!

1431
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:31.680
Come on, man. Help me put
him back in his chair.

1432
01:39:34.808 --> 01:39:38.812
At least they had the fucking decency
to tell us that we were fighting...

1433
01:39:38.896 --> 01:39:41.106
<i>the Communists.</i>

1434
01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:43.692
Trying to prevent
a domino effect.

1435
01:39:43.817 --> 01:39:47.196
<i>Whereas this whole fucking thing- this whole
fucking thing is nothing about nothing,</i>

1436
01:39:47.196 --> 01:39:49.198
<i>about oil,</i>

1437
01:39:49.198 --> 01:39:51.200
<i>which is what I personally hear, Dude.</i>

1438
01:39:51.283 --> 01:39:53.493
Sure you'll see
some tank battles,

1439
01:39:53.619 --> 01:39:58.081
but fighting in desert is very different
from fighting in canopy jungles.

1440
01:39:58.207 --> 01:40:00.209
I mean, 'Nam was
a foot soldier's war,

1441
01:40:00.292 --> 01:40:02.586
whereas this thing should, uh,

1442
01:40:02.711 --> 01:40:05.005
you know,
should be a piece of cake.

1443
01:40:05.088 --> 01:40:08.383
I mean, I had an M16, jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1444
01:40:08.509 --> 01:40:11.887
Me and Charlie- eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.

1445
01:40:12.012 --> 01:40:14.306
That's fucking combat.

1446
01:40:14.389 --> 01:40:17.309
The man in the black pajamas,
Dude.

1447
01:40:17.392 --> 01:40:19.394
Worthy fucking adversary.

1448
01:40:19.394 --> 01:40:22.689
Who's in pajamas, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1449
01:40:22.814 --> 01:40:26.818
Whereas what we have here, a bunch of fig
eaters wearing towels on their head,

1450
01:40:26.902 --> 01:40:29.196
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1451
01:40:29.279 --> 01:40:32.199
This-This is not a worthy
fucking adversary. <i>Hey!</i>

1452
01:40:32.282 --> 01:40:34.785
What's this day-of-rest shit?

1453
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:39.414
What's this bullshit? I don't fucking care!
It don't matter to Jesus.

1454
01:40:39.498 --> 01:40:43.794
<i>But you not fooling me, man. You might
feel the fucks in the league office.</i>

1455
01:40:43.794 --> 01:40:46.296
But you don't fool Jesus.

1456
01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:49.007
It's bush-league
psych-out stuff.

1457
01:40:49.091 --> 01:40:51.718
Laughable, man!

1458
01:40:51.718 --> 01:40:55.389
I would've fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1459
01:40:55.514 --> 01:40:58.892
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1460
01:40:59.017 --> 01:41:02.604
Whool You got a date
Wednesday, baby!

1461
01:41:06.984 --> 01:41:08.986
He's crackin'.

1462
01:41:08.986 --> 01:41:10.988
The whole concept
of age.

1463
01:41:10.988 --> 01:41:15.409
Many learned men have disputed this,
but in the 14th century, the Romabam-

1464
01:41:15.492 --> 01:41:17.494
Jesus.

1465
01:41:25.502 --> 01:41:27.713
Well,
they finally did it.

1466
01:41:27.713 --> 01:41:29.882
They killed
my fucking car.

1467
01:41:30.007 --> 01:41:33.510
We want the money,
Lebowski.

1468
01:41:33.594 --> 01:41:36.305
Ja. Otherwise,
we kill the girl.

1469
01:41:36.388 --> 01:41:39.683
Ja. It seems you have forgotten
our little deal, Lebowski.

1470
01:41:39.808 --> 01:41:42.603
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit!

1471
01:41:42.686 --> 01:41:45.397
<i>We know you never did.</i>

1472
01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:49.818
Are these the Nazis, Walter? No, Donny. These men
are nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of.

1473
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.780
We don't care.

1474
01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:57.201
We still want the money,
Lebowski, or we fuck you up.

1475
01:41:57.201 --> 01:42:00.412
Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.
Cool it, Walter.

1476
01:42:00.495 --> 01:42:03.790
No. Without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1477
01:42:03.916 --> 01:42:07.002
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1478
01:42:07.085 --> 01:42:09.379
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

1479
01:42:09.505 --> 01:42:13.383
She thought we could get a million dollars.
It's not fair!

1480
01:42:13.383 --> 01:42:18.180
Fair? Who's the fucking nihilists around
here, you bunch of fucking crybabies?

1481
01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.891
No, no. Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal.

1482
01:42:21.016 --> 01:42:23.018
<i>There never was any money.</i>

1483
01:42:23.101 --> 01:42:27.189
<i>The big Lebowski gave me an empty
briefcase, so take it up with him, man!</i>

1484
01:42:27.314 --> 01:42:29.900
And I would like
my undies back.

1485
01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.986
These guys gonna hurt us? No, Donny.
These men are cowards.

1486
01:42:33.111 --> 01:42:34.988
Okay!

1487
01:42:35.113 --> 01:42:38.492
So we takes the money you have
on you, and we cells it even.

1488
01:42:38.617 --> 01:42:40.494
Fuck you.

1489
01:42:40.619 --> 01:42:43.997
Hey, no. Come on, Walter.
We're ending this thing cheap, man.

1490
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:46.500
No. What's mine is mine.
No, come on, Walter.

1491
01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.211
<i>No funny stuff.
A“ fight. A“ fight.</i>

1492
01:42:49.294 --> 01:42:53.590
No <i>filnny stuff.</i> I got, uh,
four bucks, almost five.

1493
01:42:53.715 --> 01:42:56.510
- <i>I-I got</i> $18.
<i>- What's mine is mine.</i>

1494
01:42:56.593 --> 01:42:59.680
We fuck you up, man!
We takes the money!

1495
01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.683
Come and get it.

1496
01:43:02.808 --> 01:43:07.104
We <i>fuck</i> you up!
Show me what you got, nihilists.

1497
01:43:07.187 --> 01:43:09.898
- I fuck you!
- Walter, come on. He's got a sword.

1498
01:43:09.982 --> 01:43:12.317
Fucking dipshit
with a nine-toad woman!

1499
01:43:12.401 --> 01:43:15.612
- I fuck you!
<i>- Fuck you!</i>

1500
01:43:15.696 --> 01:43:17.406
I fuck you! I-

1501
01:43:21.118 --> 01:43:23.704
- I fuck you!
- Take it easy, man.

1502
01:43:23.787 --> 01:43:27.082
Take the four dollars.

1503
01:43:30.419 --> 01:43:33.088
I fuck you! I'm gonna hit you
with the fucking ball, man.

1504
01:43:38.093 --> 01:43:40.179
<i>- Hey, dickheadl</i>
- Anti-Semite.

1505
01:43:40.304 --> 01:43:44.183
<i>I fuck you in the ass!
I fuck you in the ass!</i>

1506
01:43:44.308 --> 01:43:46.810
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1507
01:43:46.894 --> 01:43:49.396
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1508
01:43:53.609 --> 01:43:56.904
We got a man down, Dude!

1509
01:43:58.405 --> 01:44:02.701
Oh, God.
They shot him, man.

1510
01:44:02.784 --> 01:44:04.786
He's not shot. No, Dude.
Are you shot, Donny?

1511
01:44:04.786 --> 01:44:06.997
- There weren't any shots fired.
<i>- Huh?</i>

1512
01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:11.001
<i>It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.</i>

1513
01:44:11.084 --> 01:44:13.879
I'd go myself, but I'm pumpin'
blood, might pass out.

1514
01:44:14.004 --> 01:44:17.299
Rest easy, good buddy.
You're doing fine.

1515
01:44:17.382 --> 01:44:19.801
We got help choppering in.

1516
01:44:46.703 --> 01:44:49.581
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

1517
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:51.583
Yeah, man.

1518
01:44:51.708 --> 01:44:53.585
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

1519
01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:56.713
Jeff Lebowski.
Walter Sobchak.

1520
01:44:56.713 --> 01:44:59.591
Uh, the Dude, actually, is, uh-

1521
01:44:59.716 --> 01:45:02.386
Excuse me?
Oh, nothin'.

1522
01:45:03.804 --> 01:45:08.517
Yes. I understand you're
taking away the remains?

1523
01:45:08.517 --> 01:45:10.394
Yeah.

1524
01:45:10.519 --> 01:45:12.521
We have the urn.

1525
01:45:13.605 --> 01:45:15.899
I assume this is credit card?

1526
01:45:15.983 --> 01:45:17.985
Yeah.

1527
01:45:31.999 --> 01:45:33.917
What's this?

1528
01:45:35.002 --> 01:45:39.381
Now, <i>that's for the</i> urn. <i>Don 1 need it.
We 'ne scattering the ashes.</i>

1529
01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:42.217
Yes. So we were informed.

1530
01:45:42.301 --> 01:45:45.304
However, we must, of course,
transmit the remains to you...

1531
01:45:45.387 --> 01:45:47.306
in a receptacle.

1532
01:45:48.682 --> 01:45:50.601
That's $180.

1533
01:45:50.684 --> 01:45:54.605
It is our most
modestly priced receptacle.

1534
01:45:54.688 --> 01:45:57.191
Uh, well, can't we just, uh-
A hundred and eighty dollars?

1535
01:45:57.316 --> 01:45:59.484
They range up to 3,000.

1536
01:45:59.610 --> 01:46:03.405
Uh-We're, uh- Can't we just
rent it from you, you know?

1537
01:46:03.488 --> 01:46:06.408
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

1538
01:46:06.491 --> 01:46:08.911
<i>- We're scattering the fucking ashes!</i>
- Walter, Walter.

1539
01:46:08.994 --> 01:46:11.079
Just because we're bereaved
doesn't make us saps!

1540
01:46:11.079 --> 01:46:13.916
Sir, please lower your voices.

1541
01:46:13.999 --> 01:46:17.920
Man, don't you have, you know,
something, uh, else we can put him in?

1542
01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:19.880
You know?

1543
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.508
That is our most
modestly priced receptacle.

1544
01:46:22.591 --> 01:46:24.218
Goddamn it!

1545
01:46:25.302 --> 01:46:28.096
Is there a Ralph's
around here?

1546
01:46:54.915 --> 01:46:58.794
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1547
01:46:58.794 --> 01:47:01.004
He was- He was one of us.

1548
01:47:01.088 --> 01:47:05.008
He was a man who loved the outdoors...
and bowling,

1549
01:47:05.092 --> 01:47:08.887
and as a surfer he explored the
beaches of Southern California...

1550
01:47:08.887 --> 01:47:12.307
from I. Jolla to Leo Carrillo...

1551
01:47:12.307 --> 01:47:14.893
and up to Pismo.

1552
01:47:15.018 --> 01:47:17.396
He died-

1553
01:47:17.396 --> 01:47:21.608
He died, as so many young men
of his generation, before his time.

1554
01:47:21.608 --> 01:47:24.820
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him,

1555
01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:28.198
as you took so many bright,
flowering young men...

1556
01:47:28.282 --> 01:47:30.701
at Khe Sanh, at Ian Doc,

1557
01:47:30.784 --> 01:47:32.995
<i>at Hill 364.</i>

1558
01:47:34.288 --> 01:47:37.082
<i>These young men gave their lives,</i>

1559
01:47:37.207 --> 01:47:39.209
and so Donny.

1560
01:47:40.794 --> 01:47:43.088
Donny, who loved bowling.

1561
01:47:45.883 --> 01:47:48.385
And so,

1562
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:50.888
Theodore Donald Karabotsos,

1563
01:47:52.306 --> 01:47:55.184
in accordance
with what we think...

1564
01:47:55.309 --> 01:47:58.604
your dying wishes
might well have been,

1565
01:47:58.604 --> 01:48:02.191
we commit your final
mortal remains...

1566
01:48:02.316 --> 01:48:06.195
to the bosom
of the Pacific Ocean,

1567
01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.780
which you loved so well.

1568
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:13.619
Good night, sweet prince.

1569
01:48:27.799 --> 01:48:29.718
Shit.

1570
01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.597
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1571
01:48:35.015 --> 01:48:37.893
Goddamn wind. Fuck-
Goddamn it, Walter!

1572
01:48:38.018 --> 01:48:40.521
You fuckin' asshole!
Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1573
01:48:40.604 --> 01:48:43.106
Everything's a fucking travesty
with you, man!

1574
01:48:43.106 --> 01:48:46.318
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
What was that shit about Vietnam?

1575
01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:49.279
Dude, I'm sorry. What the fuck does
anything have to do with Vietnam?

1576
01:48:49.404 --> 01:48:51.698
Sorry. What the fuck
are you talking about?

1577
01:48:51.782 --> 01:48:53.700
Dude, I'm sorry.

1578
01:48:56.286 --> 01:48:58.205
Fuckin'-

1579
01:49:04.294 --> 01:49:06.213
Fuck, Walter.

1580
01:49:07.798 --> 01:49:09.883
Come on, Dude.

1581
01:49:09.883 --> 01:49:11.885
Hey, fuck it, man.

1582
01:49:15.514 --> 01:49:17.516
Let's go bowlin'.

1583
01:50:11.695 --> 01:50:14.781
<i>Two oat sodas, Gary.
Right. Good luck tomorrow.</i>

1584
01:50:14.781 --> 01:50:18.285
Yeah, thanks, man.
<i>I was sorry to hear about Donn y.</i>

1585
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:21.914
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1586
01:50:21.997 --> 01:50:26.001
sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes, um-

1587
01:50:26.084 --> 01:50:28.086
Hey, man!

1588
01:50:28.212 --> 01:50:31.715
How do you do, Dude?
I wondered if I'd see you again.

1589
01:50:31.798 --> 01:50:35.219
I wouldn't miss the semis. How's
things been goin'? Oh, yeah?

1590
01:50:35.219 --> 01:50:38.514
Well, you know, strikes and
gutters, ups and downs.

1591
01:50:38.597 --> 01:50:40.516
Sure. I got you.

1592
01:50:40.599 --> 01:50:43.810
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

1593
01:50:43.894 --> 01:50:46.396
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1594
01:50:46.396 --> 01:50:49.399
Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
Oh, yeah.

1595
01:50:49.483 --> 01:50:51.485
I know that you will.

1596
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:55.113
Yeah.
Well, the Dude abides.

1597
01:50:58.992 --> 01:51:01.703
Walter.

1598
01:51:01.787 --> 01:51:03.997
The Dude abides.

1599
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:12.089
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1600
01:51:12.214 --> 01:51:14.508
It's good knowing he's out there-

1601
01:51:14.591 --> 01:51:18.679
the Dude, tekin' 'er easy
for all us sinners.

1602
01:51:19.805 --> 01:51:23.684
Shush. I sure hope
he makes the finals.

1603
01:51:25.102 --> 01:51:27.312
Well, that about does 'er.

1604
01:51:27.396 --> 01:51:29.398
Wraps 'er all up.

1605
01:51:30.482 --> 01:51:34.486
Things seem to have worked out
pretty good for the Dude and Walter.

1606
01:51:34.611 --> 01:51:38.699
And it was a pretty good story,
don't ya think?

1607
01:51:38.782 --> 01:51:41.618
Made me laugh to beat the band.

1608
01:51:41.618 --> 01:51:43.620
Parts anyway.

1609
01:51:44.913 --> 01:51:47.082
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1610
01:51:48.083 --> 01:51:53.088
But then I happen to know that
there's a little Lebowski on the way.

1611
01:51:54.798 --> 01:51:57.509
I guess that's the way
the whole dumed human comedy...

1612
01:51:57.509 --> 01:52:01.013
keeps perpetuating itself...

1613
01:52:01.096 --> 01:52:03.682
down through the generations.

1614
01:52:03.807 --> 01:52:07.311
Westward the wagons,
across the sands of time...

1615
01:52:07.311 --> 01:52:09.313
until we-

1616
01:52:09.313 --> 01:52:13.692
Oh, look at me.
I'm rambling again.

1617
01:52:13.692 --> 01:52:16.695
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1618
01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:19.281
Catch you later on down the trail.

1619
01:52:20.490 --> 01:52:24.494
Say, friend. You got any more
of that good sarsaparilla?
