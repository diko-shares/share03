1
00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:01.627
There's some food
over here! Quick!

2
00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:14.525
Come on!

3
00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:35.104
Why is he doing that?

4
00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:36.536
He's starving.

5
00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:01.561
Your father is dead, Coriolanus.

6
00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:03.961
It was a rebel, they say.

7
00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.661
A trap out in the forest

8
00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:08.430
in 12.

9
00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:15.820
It's up to us now
to make him proud.

10
00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.055
Tigris?

11
00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.421
<i>♪ Gem of Panem</i>

12
00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:13.323
<i>♪ Mighty city</i>

13
00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:14.684
Tigris, where's the shirt?

14
00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.383
<i>♪ Through the ages
You shine anew</i>

15
00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:22.951
<i>♪ We humbly kneel
To your ideal</i>

16
00:03:22.976 --> 00:03:25.662
<i>♪ And pledge Our love to you ♪</i>

17
00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:27.780
That's beautiful, Grandma'am.

18
00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:30.412
- Perhaps a little sharp today.
- Oh.

19
00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:32.633
Have you seen Tigris with
my father's dress shirt?

20
00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:33.692
No.

21
00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:34.751
Coryo?

22
00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.897
- Tigris?
- I'm sorry. I know I'm late.

23
00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:38.914
But look, I did it.

24
00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.361
Or, I did something.

25
00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.314
I think it's really gorgeous.

26
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.297
It's beautiful.

27
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.400
Best cousin ever.

28
00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:51.647
Tell me everything.

29
00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:54.631
Where do I start? I
told Fabricia at work

30
00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:56.928
that she needed to
bleach her white curtains

31
00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:58.851
and I slipped the
shirt in when I did it.

32
00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:00.444
The tesserae buttons
I made from...

33
00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.303
From the bathroom tiles.

34
00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:03.496
Brilliant.

35
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.956
Oh. Did you find the potatoes?
I boiled them for the starch

36
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:08.017
and you should really
eat something today.

37
00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:09.244
Save them for Grandma'am.

38
00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.787
You look so handsome.

39
00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:16.303
Grandma'am! Come see!

40
00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:19.607
Coriolanus Snow.

41
00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:22.867
Future president of Panem.

42
00:04:23.355 --> 00:04:24.756
We salute you.

43
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:26.482
Just a moment.

44
00:04:27.782 --> 00:04:28.921
Wait, Grandma'am.

45
00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:32.219
I can grow plenty
more. After today.

46
00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.953
Got the grades,
never missed class.

47
00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:39.858
Ten years.

48
00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:42.436
Even Dean Highbottom
can't deny us this now.

49
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:43.593
Dean doesn't hate you.

50
00:04:43.618 --> 00:04:45.491
He hates everyone.

51
00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:46.867
He despises me.

52
00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:50.109
What's the first thing you'll
spend the prize money on?

53
00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.431
New dress?

54
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.328
Chocolate?

55
00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.574
Chocolate!

56
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.460
It's the Plinth Prize, Tigris.

57
00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:02.531
We'll be able to pay the rent.

58
00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:04.219
Snow lands on top.

59
00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.046
Why, Coriolanus Snow.

60
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:38.787
Clemmie.

61
00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:42.609
Are you sweating?

62
00:05:42.828 --> 00:05:43.983
It's Reaping Day.

63
00:05:44.008 --> 00:05:45.442
We gave driver the morning off.

64
00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:47.234
Ugh! That ingrate
should be begging

65
00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.438
to chauffeur you around today.

66
00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:50.197
Just don't forget. I
was your class partner

67
00:05:50.222 --> 00:05:52.025
while you're gloating
over the Plinth Prize.

68
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.705
Prize? Please.

69
00:05:53.747 --> 00:05:55.883
- I just want to serve Panem.
- Mmm.

70
00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.091
Hungry?

71
00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.487
Cook served steak for breakfast.

72
00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:01.959
We had to throw half out.

73
00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:03.219
Shame on you, Coryo.

74
00:06:03.244 --> 00:06:05.707
Don't you know that they're
starving in the districts?

75
00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:10.062
Good luck.

76
00:06:10.346 --> 00:06:11.715
Not that you'll need it.

77
00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:14.037
Hi.

78
00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.520
Finally, the star pupil.

79
00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.040
That's a snazzy shirt.

80
00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:20.834
What are those
buttons, tesserae?

81
00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:21.960
Huh.

82
00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:24.015
That's why they remind me
of the maid's bathroom.

83
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.791
Have you tried this
lamb? It's scandalous.

84
00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:28.785
Ugh. Only the vulgar eat
with their fingers, Felix.

85
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.398
What, Daddy not teach
you table manners?

86
00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:32.265
Maybe he would have

87
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.992
if he wasn't so busy
running the country.

88
00:06:34.017 --> 00:06:36.653
Hey, they called us here
for the Plinth Prize, right?

89
00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:39.481
Because I heard Dr. Gaul's
in the building.

90
00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:41.002
"Plinth."

91
00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:43.062
I mean, look at his spawn.

92
00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:44.489
Who would have
thought that you could

93
00:06:44.514 --> 00:06:46.057
buy your way into the Capitol?

94
00:06:46.082 --> 00:06:48.317
Well, you can't buy class.

95
00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:50.028
Did you see his mother's outfit?

96
00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:52.314
- Sorry, his "Ma's."
- Oh.

97
00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:54.842
Dress a turnip in a ball gown,
and it'll still beg to be mashed.

98
00:06:55.573 --> 00:06:57.315
Don't do that. We all
know that you like him.

99
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.808
I don't like him, Arachne.

100
00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.134
I tolerate him.

101
00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:01.216
He's district.

102
00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:02.233
Tolerate him.

103
00:07:02.258 --> 00:07:03.712
- Just don't encourage him.
- Okay. Sure.

104
00:07:03.737 --> 00:07:05.004
I hear one more time

105
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.997
how immoral these
Hunger Games are,

106
00:07:07.022 --> 00:07:08.865
I'll put him in the arena mys...

107
00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:11.084
Sejanus.

108
00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:12.944
You made it to the
Reaping for once.

109
00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:14.411
And you made it to
graduation, Festus.

110
00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:16.270
We're both shocked.

111
00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:18.071
Spill it. Who won the prize?

112
00:07:18.096 --> 00:07:20.187
Oh, no, I'm not gonna
ruin my father's big day.

113
00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:24.448
No one here actually likes him,
but they do love his money.

114
00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:27.122
You know what that's
like, don't you, Arachne?

115
00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.553
Funny.

116
00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:40.154
Hey, listen.

117
00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:43.349
Um, I know you have
high hopes for this.

118
00:07:45.406 --> 00:07:47.208
But there is no prize today.

119
00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:49.700
Not anymore.

120
00:07:52.303 --> 00:07:54.405
- I'm so sorry.
- What?

121
00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:04.030
How tantalizing to see all
your shining young faces

122
00:08:04.055 --> 00:08:06.585
on this auspicious day.

123
00:08:06.782 --> 00:08:11.311
I am Dr. Volumnia Gaul,
your humble Head Gamemaker,

124
00:08:11.336 --> 00:08:13.398
in charge of the War Department

125
00:08:13.423 --> 00:08:17.202
and all its affiliated concerns.

126
00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:20.984
I've broken free of
my laboratory today,

127
00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:22.577
to examine you.

128
00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:26.056
The leaders of the
next generation.

129
00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:29.399
I won't be around
forever, after all.

130
00:08:29.424 --> 00:08:32.899
And now to that end,

131
00:08:32.924 --> 00:08:35.101
I am honored to introduce to you

132
00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:38.219
the creator of the
Hunger Games themselves.

133
00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:41.877
Dean Casca Highbottom.

134
00:08:41.902 --> 00:08:44.204
Uh...

135
00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:47.413
Select students,

136
00:08:49.103 --> 00:08:50.571
faculty,

137
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:53.786
and, of course, Dr. Gaul,

138
00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:58.351
I have summoned
you all here today

139
00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.946
for the 10th annual
Reaping Ceremony

140
00:09:00.971 --> 00:09:02.759
in which we choose two children

141
00:09:02.784 --> 00:09:04.522
from each district

142
00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:08.985
to throw into the Capitol Arena to
fight to the death in the Hunger Games.

143
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.556
I can't believe
they still allow him

144
00:09:10.581 --> 00:09:11.777
to speak in public.

145
00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:13.604
And here sit...

146
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:18.149
our own 24 top prospects

147
00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:21.233
all waiting to hear the
results of hard study

148
00:09:21.258 --> 00:09:23.085
in this prestigious institution.

149
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.002
Eager to learn who's won
that Plinth Prize, no doubt.

150
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.677
And a golden future.

151
00:09:30.013 --> 00:09:31.147
However,

152
00:09:31.249 --> 00:09:32.585
I am here to tell you

153
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.936
that there has been
a change this year.

154
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:39.737
One final assignment
to prove your worth.

155
00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:40.796
Because...

156
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:43.620
the esteemed citizens
of the Capitol

157
00:09:43.654 --> 00:09:45.452
have grown bored of the Games

158
00:09:45.477 --> 00:09:47.413
and simply aren't
watching anymore.

159
00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:51.119
And if the Games are to continue
at all, there must be an audience.

160
00:09:51.144 --> 00:09:55.115
So, Head Gamemaker Dr. Gaul
has stepped in to...

161
00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:57.553
incentivize patriotic values

162
00:09:57.578 --> 00:10:01.483
with her own unique
flair, starting with you.

163
00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:03.764
The Plinth Prize will
no longer be determined

164
00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:05.632
by who has the best grades.

165
00:10:05.657 --> 00:10:06.776
Excuse me?

166
00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:09.936
But by who is the best
mentor in the Hunger Games.

167
00:10:11.453 --> 00:10:13.416
This is a brand new role.

168
00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:15.196
As the Reaping progresses live,

169
00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:17.405
I will allocate each
district tribute

170
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.397
a Capitol mentor
behind the scenes,

171
00:10:19.422 --> 00:10:23.053
one who must just persuade them

172
00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:24.761
to perform for the cameras.

173
00:10:24.786 --> 00:10:27.063
Obviously, the best
mentor will be the one

174
00:10:27.088 --> 00:10:28.523
whose tribute wins the Games.

175
00:10:28.548 --> 00:10:30.386
What if I get a
pathetic runt girl

176
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:32.680
from one of the poor
districts, like 8 or 12?

177
00:10:32.789 --> 00:10:34.350
They're just gonna
die in two minutes

178
00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:36.178
like they did last year
and the year before.

179
00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:38.613
Your role is to
turn these children

180
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.156
into spectacles, Ms. Crane.

181
00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:42.459
Not survivors.

182
00:10:42.484 --> 00:10:46.121
Victory in the Games is only
one of our considerations.

183
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.579
Your entire future rests
on this last project.

184
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.110
Oh, and I must tell you
that anyone caught cheating

185
00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:56.804
to give their tributes
an unfair advantage...

186
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.718
will just have
no future at all.

187
00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:04.141
Oh! Here we go.

188
00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:09.615
Let the Reaping ceremony begin.

189
00:11:10.264 --> 00:11:11.497
District 1.

190
00:11:13.121 --> 00:11:17.564
Boy goes to Livia Cardew.

191
00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.282
Girl goes to Palmyra Monty.

192
00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:25.810
District 2 boy...

193
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:28.546
How apt.

194
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:30.806
Boy goes to Sejanus Plinth.

195
00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:33.793
You got the pick of the litter.

196
00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.718
You forget. I'm
part of that litter.

197
00:11:36.743 --> 00:11:38.382
4, boy,

198
00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:40.022
Persephone Price.

199
00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:42.350
Girl, Festus Creed.

200
00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:47.354
7, boy, Vipsania Sickle.

201
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.832
Girl, Pup Harrington.

202
00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:56.769
8, boy, Juno Phipps.

203
00:11:56.794 --> 00:11:59.830
Girl, Hilarius Heavensbee.

204
00:12:00.556 --> 00:12:02.925
10, boy,

205
00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.560
Domitia Whimsiwick.

206
00:12:05.396 --> 00:12:09.708
Mmm. Girl, Arachne Crane.

207
00:12:09.733 --> 00:12:13.569
11, boy, Clemensia Dovecote.

208
00:12:13.594 --> 00:12:17.062
11, girl, Felix Ravinstill.

209
00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:20.190
12, boy,

210
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.858
Lysistrata Vickers.

211
00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:26.007
Oh. You'll be happy
about this, Ms. Crane.

212
00:12:26.032 --> 00:12:29.164
The "runt girl",
from District 12,

213
00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:32.161
she belongs to Coriolanus Snow.

214
00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:41.419
Lucy Gray Baird.

215
00:12:55.247 --> 00:12:58.317
Sing your way out of
this one, Lucy Gray.

216
00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:03.841
What is that dress?

217
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:05.844
Is she some sort of clown?

218
00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:09.475
Lucy Gray.

219
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.203
I didn't know.

220
00:13:11.228 --> 00:13:13.531
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

221
00:13:31.046 --> 00:13:33.817
My daughter! Help her!

222
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.419
- Help her! Help her!
- Get it off! Get it off!

223
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.962
That's enough. Leave her be.

224
00:13:56.906 --> 00:13:58.607
Just give me a minute, boys.

225
00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:06.352
<i>♪ You can't take my past</i>

226
00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:09.881
<i>♪ You can't take my history</i>

227
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.190
<i>♪ You could take my pa</i>

228
00:14:14.223 --> 00:14:19.128
<i>♪ But his name's a mystery</i>

229
00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:22.331
<i>♪ Nothing you can take from me</i>

230
00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:28.370
<i>♪ Was ever worth keepin'</i>

231
00:14:33.344 --> 00:14:35.585
<i>♪ Nothing you can take</i>

232
00:14:36.746 --> 00:14:38.514
<i>♪ Was ever worth keepin'</i>

233
00:14:38.547 --> 00:14:39.982
Singing?

234
00:14:40.015 --> 00:14:41.844
Is she out of her mind?

235
00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:49.651
<i>♪ Can't take my charm</i>

236
00:14:51.795 --> 00:14:54.875
<i>♪ Can't take my humor</i>

237
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.635
<i>♪ Can't take my wealth</i>

238
00:14:58.668 --> 00:15:00.426
Capitol says keep rolling.

239
00:15:00.451 --> 00:15:04.703
♪ <i>'Cause it's just a rumor</i>

240
00:15:10.647 --> 00:15:13.984

<i>♪ You can kiss my ass! ♪</i>

245
00:15:48.289 --> 00:15:49.485
Come on, boys.

246
00:15:52.822 --> 00:15:54.969
Well, she's mentally ill.

247
00:16:08.638 --> 00:16:10.640
Proud, I see.

248
00:16:10.674 --> 00:16:12.071
Like your father.

249
00:16:13.043 --> 00:16:15.779
Yes. He and I
were best friends.

250
00:16:17.097 --> 00:16:18.132
Once.

251
00:16:18.648 --> 00:16:20.115
Enlighten me, Mr. Snow.

252
00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:22.780
What are your plans
after these Games?

253
00:16:22.805 --> 00:16:25.021
I hope to go on to
the University, sir.

254
00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:26.388
Naturally.

255
00:16:26.422 --> 00:16:29.312
And if you fail to win the
Plinth Prize, what then?

256
00:16:29.337 --> 00:16:31.006
We'd pay the tuition, of course.

257
00:16:31.422 --> 00:16:32.494
Look at you.

258
00:16:33.964 --> 00:16:35.431
Your makeshift shirt

259
00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:39.368
and your too tight shoes.
Trying desperately to fit in

260
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:43.383
when I know the Snows don't
have a pot to piss in.

261
00:16:44.273 --> 00:16:46.843
Good luck with that
poor little songbird.

262
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:50.914
He's sabotaging us.

263
00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:52.649
That girl's not gonna
win these Games.

264
00:16:52.682 --> 00:16:55.539
You saw her. She's
underfed, unstable.

265
00:16:55.564 --> 00:16:57.799
The Dean said it's not
just about winning.

266
00:16:57.824 --> 00:17:00.192
Everything is about winning.

267
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:02.859
If not the Games
now, then the crowd.

268
00:17:02.892 --> 00:17:06.062
Lucy Gray won't survive a
minute inside that arena.

269
00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:09.155
So that means we have to make
every second before then count.

270
00:17:10.132 --> 00:17:12.030
I'll get her to sing again.

271
00:17:12.055 --> 00:17:14.971
I wouldn't sing a note
for you if I was her.

272
00:17:15.005 --> 00:17:16.740
I wouldn't do anything at all.

273
00:17:16.773 --> 00:17:18.675
Unless I could trust you.

274
00:17:18.708 --> 00:17:20.257
She's district, Tigris.

275
00:17:20.282 --> 00:17:22.671
She knows we hate her,
and she wants us dead.

276
00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:25.015
How am I supposed to
get her to trust me?

277
00:17:25.048 --> 00:17:27.249
Imagine it was your
name that they pulled

278
00:17:27.282 --> 00:17:29.451
and you had been
ripped from your home.

279
00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:32.689
I'd just wanna know that somebody
still cared about me out here.

280
00:17:32.722 --> 00:17:36.358
Don't discount her just
because she's district, Coryo.

281
00:17:36.798 --> 00:17:39.047
You might have more in common
with her than you think.

282
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:01.618
Transfer team, up front!

283
00:18:08.357 --> 00:18:10.459
Get off the train!

284
00:18:12.162 --> 00:18:13.663
Move.

285
00:18:13.697 --> 00:18:14.864
Let's go.

286
00:18:16.265 --> 00:18:17.599
Get out!

287
00:18:20.136 --> 00:18:21.570
Come on out!

288
00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:24.040
I said let's go!

289
00:18:24.074 --> 00:18:26.575
No! No!

290
00:18:26.609 --> 00:18:27.943
I will not...

291
00:18:27.968 --> 00:18:29.998
Go! Keep moving!

292
00:18:31.614 --> 00:18:33.616
- No!
- Come on.

293
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.018
No!

294
00:18:35.051 --> 00:18:37.286
I said let's go!

295
00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:39.354
I won't go. I won't. No.

296
00:18:39.388 --> 00:18:41.691
Come on, get her outta there.

297
00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:43.061
Welcome to the Capitol.

298
00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:49.928
When I was little, my
mama used to bathe me

299
00:18:49.953 --> 00:18:51.655
in buttermilk and rose petals.

300
00:19:00.261 --> 00:19:01.888
Tastes like bedtime.

301
00:19:03.512 --> 00:19:05.347
You look like you
shouldn't be here.

302
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.282
Well, I shouldn't.

303
00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:08.618
But I'm your mentor.

304
00:19:09.085 --> 00:19:10.385
A rebel.

305
00:19:11.587 --> 00:19:15.290
What does my mentor do
besides bring me roses?

306
00:19:15.324 --> 00:19:17.193
I do my best to
take care of you.

307
00:19:17.227 --> 00:19:18.895
No!

308
00:19:18.928 --> 00:19:20.163
On your feet.

309
00:19:20.196 --> 00:19:21.965
Good luck with that, gorgeous.

310
00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:25.902
Come on, let's go.

311
00:19:26.302 --> 00:19:27.471
Move it.

312
00:19:27.771 --> 00:19:29.662
Excuse me, can I...

313
00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:32.742
Excuse me, I'd like to
escort my tribute...

314
00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:34.010
Fall in.

315
00:19:35.344 --> 00:19:37.412
In the truck. Hurry up.

316
00:19:39.249 --> 00:19:40.449
Hey!

317
00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:42.074
You, come on!

318
00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:43.266
Come on.

319
00:19:47.842 --> 00:19:48.992
Get in!

320
00:20:00.003 --> 00:20:01.037
Hi.

321
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.471
What's the matter, pretty boy?

322
00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:05.241
- You in the wrong cage?
- No.

323
00:20:05.275 --> 00:20:06.609
This cage is delightful.

324
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.244
Get him, Reaper.

325
00:20:08.278 --> 00:20:10.013
I will kill you right now.

326
00:20:10.046 --> 00:20:11.214
He'll do it too.

327
00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:13.183
Reaper killed a
Peacekeeper back in 11.

328
00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:14.284
Quiet, Dill.

329
00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:16.518
- I say we all kill him.
- I'm in.

330
00:20:16.552 --> 00:20:17.663
Nothing left to lose now.

331
00:20:17.687 --> 00:20:19.378
Y'all got family back home?

332
00:20:19.724 --> 00:20:21.651
They'll kill them
if you hurt him.

333
00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:22.710
Then you.

334
00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:25.069
Besides, he's my mentor.

335
00:20:25.094 --> 00:20:26.428
I might need him.

336
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:27.815
How come you get a mender?

337
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.431
Mentor.

338
00:20:29.464 --> 00:20:30.651
You each get one.

339
00:20:31.634 --> 00:20:33.970
Oh, and we'll just trust
you on that? Right?

340
00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:35.972
I'm just here to help you.

341
00:20:36.005 --> 00:20:39.075
Why does rainbow girl here
get special treatment, hmm?

342
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.078
Why aren't our menders here?

343
00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:45.526
Just not inspired, I guess.

344
00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:54.686
- All right, hold on!
- Get off me!

345
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:01.448
Oh! Ah!

346
00:21:01.473 --> 00:21:04.669
Ouch. Well, we'll give them a chance
to stand up and catch their breath.

347
00:21:04.694 --> 00:21:06.229
I'm jealous of that entrance.

348
00:21:06.254 --> 00:21:07.779
I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman,

349
00:21:07.804 --> 00:21:09.222
a man who needs no introduction.

350
00:21:09.247 --> 00:21:10.649
You all know me as your
favorite weatherman

351
00:21:10.673 --> 00:21:12.909
and amateur magician.

352
00:21:12.942 --> 00:21:15.410
But guess where I am
today. Here's a hint.

353
00:21:15.444 --> 00:21:16.946
That's right. The Capitol Zoo,

354
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.682
where this year's tributes
will be held here on display

355
00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:21.925
behind these bars for
your viewing pleasure.

356
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.118
That's right.

357
00:21:23.143 --> 00:21:25.545
All 24 of them 'cause...

358
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.706
What in the gem of Panem?

359
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:30.399
You see, that's the
Academy rouge, no?

360
00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:32.127
Excuse me. Hello, sir.

361
00:21:32.152 --> 00:21:33.730
Yes, you. In the red.

362
00:21:33.763 --> 00:21:35.995
Who are you and why are
you in there with them?

363
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.555
We're live.

364
00:21:38.873 --> 00:21:40.575
The Capitol is watching.

365
00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:44.927
Own it.

366
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.151
Are you all right?

367
00:21:49.137 --> 00:21:51.438
Sir? Who are you?

368
00:21:51.463 --> 00:21:53.366
Lucy Gray Baird,

369
00:21:53.391 --> 00:21:55.027
may I introduce you
to my neighbors?

370
00:21:55.052 --> 00:21:57.073
A response would be
greatly appreciated,

371
00:21:57.098 --> 00:21:59.815
but anything would be nice.

372
00:22:01.877 --> 00:22:03.268
Hello?

373
00:22:05.588 --> 00:22:07.489
Can they not hear me in there?

374
00:22:08.941 --> 00:22:11.081
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

375
00:22:11.113 --> 00:22:12.385
They're holding hands.

376
00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:13.942
Yes, yes, yes.

377
00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:16.047
Who are you, sir? What are
you doing in the cage here?

378
00:22:17.418 --> 00:22:19.510
Hi. How do you do?

379
00:22:19.535 --> 00:22:21.605
My name is Coriolanus Snow.

380
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.120
And this is my tribute.

381
00:22:23.145 --> 00:22:24.847
Lucy Gray Baird
from District 12.

382
00:22:24.872 --> 00:22:25.873
Hi there.

383
00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:28.432
- What's your name?
- My name is Pontius.

384
00:22:28.457 --> 00:22:30.659
It's nice to meet you.
Is this your sister?

385
00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.653
That's Venus. She's only four.

386
00:22:32.678 --> 00:22:35.114
Well, I think four is
a very smart age to be.

387
00:22:35.139 --> 00:22:37.026
Where'd you find that snake?

388
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.528
Well, he found me. Must
have been a music lover.

389
00:22:39.561 --> 00:22:41.264
My singing calmed
him right down.

390
00:22:41.297 --> 00:22:42.899
Can I touch your dress?

391
00:22:42.932 --> 00:22:43.967
Of course.

392
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.835
I like your dress too.

393
00:22:45.868 --> 00:22:48.323
- Oh. And who might you be?
- You don't know who I am?

394
00:22:48.348 --> 00:22:49.489
Don't laugh.

395
00:22:49.514 --> 00:22:52.183
Not everyone has televisions
out in the districts.

396
00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:53.978
I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman.

397
00:22:54.003 --> 00:22:55.805
But more enticingly,
who are you,

398
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.565
Lucy From District 12?

399
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.946
Oh. It's Lucy Gray.

400
00:22:58.971 --> 00:23:01.272
And I'm not actually from 12.

401
00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.733
No, my people are Covey.

402
00:23:02.758 --> 00:23:04.993
We're like a family.
We're musicians by trade

403
00:23:05.018 --> 00:23:07.307
and we travel from place to
place as the fancy takes us.

404
00:23:07.332 --> 00:23:10.702
At least we used to. Before
the Peacekeepers rounded us up.

405
00:23:10.727 --> 00:23:13.027
I see. But now
you're District 12.

406
00:23:13.052 --> 00:23:14.420
- If you say so.
- Yes.

407
00:23:14.491 --> 00:23:16.392
Your dress is far from gray

408
00:23:16.417 --> 00:23:18.854
and it seems to be a big
hit with the children.

409
00:23:18.879 --> 00:23:21.782
Oh, it is? Well, the Covey love
color, me more so than most.

410
00:23:21.807 --> 00:23:24.242
But this dress was my mama's
so it's extra special to me.

411
00:23:24.267 --> 00:23:25.868
Mmm-hmm. And she's
in District 12?

412
00:23:25.893 --> 00:23:28.402
Well, only her bones, darling.
Only her pearly white bones.

413
00:23:30.294 --> 00:23:31.596
Do you know my mentor?

414
00:23:31.817 --> 00:23:33.485
Says his name is Coriolanus Snow

415
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.921
and clearly, I got the
cake with the cream

416
00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.948
'cause nobody else has
even bothered to show up.

417
00:23:38.819 --> 00:23:42.390
The Gamemakers did tell you
to jump in the cage with them?

418
00:23:42.415 --> 00:23:44.585
They didn't tell me not to.

419
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.154
They just said that
it was a mentor's job

420
00:23:46.179 --> 00:23:49.383
to introduce our tributes
to the citizens of Panem.

421
00:23:49.408 --> 00:23:50.577
And I thought, well,

422
00:23:50.602 --> 00:23:51.813
if Lucy Gray is brave
enough to be here,

423
00:23:51.838 --> 00:23:53.449
- then why shouldn't I be, too?
- Hmm.

424
00:23:53.474 --> 00:23:55.075
For the record, I
didn't have a choice.

425
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.435
For the record, I think you're
about to be whisked away, young man.

426
00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.473
Let's go.

427
00:23:59.498 --> 00:24:00.599
Oh. Hey...

428
00:24:00.784 --> 00:24:02.352
Get us some food, please.

429
00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:04.322
Jessup and I haven't
eaten since the Reaping.

430
00:24:04.347 --> 00:24:06.783
The 10th annual Hunger
Games are soon approaching.

431
00:24:06.816 --> 00:24:09.819
So come down to the zoo,
and see these tributes

432
00:24:09.852 --> 00:24:13.269
before it's too late.
And I mean, too late.

433
00:24:13.294 --> 00:24:16.396
For Capitol News,
I'm Lucretius...

434
00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:20.253
"Lucky" Flickerman.

435
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.302
Your little excursion
was in violation

436
00:24:27.327 --> 00:24:31.465
of about five different
Academy rules, Mr. Snow.

437
00:24:31.568 --> 00:24:34.772
Chief amongst them,
endangering a Capitol student.

438
00:24:34.797 --> 00:24:36.098
What? Who?

439
00:24:36.123 --> 00:24:37.390
You.

440
00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.010
I'm moving for the Gamemakers

441
00:24:39.035 --> 00:24:41.460
to disqualify you as
mentor immediately.

442
00:24:41.485 --> 00:24:43.295
You said we had to get
our tributes to perform,

443
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.465
not that we had to stay away.

444
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.401
I'll add
insubordination as well.

445
00:24:46.426 --> 00:24:49.062
Holding her hand, Coryo,
introducing her to people,

446
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:50.449
you make it look as if

447
00:24:50.474 --> 00:24:51.852
we're one and the
same as those animals.

448
00:24:51.877 --> 00:24:53.345
Coriolanus didn't
show those people

449
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.648
anything they
didn't already know.

450
00:24:54.673 --> 00:24:55.851
I don't need your help, Sejanus.

451
00:24:55.876 --> 00:24:58.278
That the tributes
are human beings.

452
00:24:58.303 --> 00:24:59.504
Just like us.

453
00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:01.231
That's why nobody wants
to watch the Games.

454
00:25:01.256 --> 00:25:03.425
It's because people
know deep down

455
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.198
that winning a war 10 years ago

456
00:25:05.223 --> 00:25:07.422
doesn't justify starving
people's children,

457
00:25:07.447 --> 00:25:09.216
taking away their
freedoms, their rights.

458
00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:12.945
Snow fell down in the cage.

459
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.439
It fell down in the cage

460
00:25:15.464 --> 00:25:17.966
but it landed...

461
00:25:19.303 --> 00:25:20.404
On stage.

462
00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:22.117
You're good at Games.

463
00:25:22.142 --> 00:25:25.312
Maybe one day, you'll
be a Gamemaker like me.

464
00:25:25.337 --> 00:25:27.539
If the Games continue at all.

465
00:25:27.564 --> 00:25:29.833
Oh, they'll continue.

466
00:25:29.858 --> 00:25:34.163
With performances like young
Mr. Snow's in that zoo.

467
00:25:34.188 --> 00:25:38.492
And I came here to ask your
star mentor a question.

468
00:25:40.878 --> 00:25:44.148
What are the Hunger Games for?

469
00:25:44.268 --> 00:25:45.936
They're to punish the districts

470
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:47.463
for their uprising,

471
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.802
to commemorate the
end of the war...

472
00:25:49.827 --> 00:25:51.042
"Commemorate the..."

473
00:25:51.067 --> 00:25:52.969
Dull, dull, dull.

474
00:25:53.021 --> 00:25:55.724
Punishment can
take myriad forms.

475
00:25:55.749 --> 00:25:58.819
Why not drop bombs,
cancel food shipments,

476
00:25:58.844 --> 00:26:00.393
stage executions?

477
00:26:00.498 --> 00:26:01.766
Why Games?

478
00:26:01.846 --> 00:26:03.301
Shouldn't we be asking ourselves

479
00:26:03.326 --> 00:26:04.970
whether or not they're
right in the first place?

480
00:26:04.995 --> 00:26:06.530
You have a problem
with my Games?

481
00:26:06.555 --> 00:26:09.492
Some of those kids were two
years old when the war ended.

482
00:26:09.517 --> 00:26:12.353
The oldest of them
were only eight.

483
00:26:12.378 --> 00:26:15.182
The Capitol is supposed to
be everyone's government now.

484
00:26:15.207 --> 00:26:17.341
It is supposed to
protect all of us.

485
00:26:17.366 --> 00:26:19.569
I don't see how making children

486
00:26:19.594 --> 00:26:21.163
fight each other to the death

487
00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:22.455
is protecting anyone.

488
00:26:22.483 --> 00:26:24.719
That sort of sympathy
might interfere

489
00:26:24.744 --> 00:26:26.813
with your mentoring assignment.

490
00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:28.837
Perhaps the Capitol students

491
00:26:28.862 --> 00:26:31.432
are ill-suited to be
mentoring tributes.

492
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:33.688
Perhaps the Game's time

493
00:26:33.832 --> 00:26:35.901
- has passed.
- Dean Highbottom is wrong.

494
00:26:36.914 --> 00:26:38.549
My classmates, too.

495
00:26:39.597 --> 00:26:41.666
Maybe Sejanus is
onto something here.

496
00:26:41.737 --> 00:26:43.306
Maybe we should be viewing

497
00:26:43.331 --> 00:26:46.166
those tributes as human beings.

498
00:26:46.191 --> 00:26:49.362
I mean, you saw those kids
in the zoo, they just...

499
00:26:49.387 --> 00:26:51.621
they just wanted to
get to know Lucy Gray.

500
00:26:51.646 --> 00:26:53.281
If we need people to watch,

501
00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:54.549
we should be letting
them get closer

502
00:26:54.574 --> 00:26:56.276
to the tributes
before the Games.

503
00:26:56.301 --> 00:26:58.235
To make the stakes personal.

504
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.161
Who will watch the
Games if they care

505
00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:01.754
what happens to the tributes?

506
00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:03.648
Everyone.

507
00:27:03.673 --> 00:27:05.408
If they thought the
tribute they cared about

508
00:27:05.433 --> 00:27:07.302
had a chance of winning.

509
00:27:07.327 --> 00:27:09.094
People need someone to root for

510
00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:10.421
and someone to root against.

511
00:27:10.446 --> 00:27:12.316
We need them to invest.

512
00:27:12.341 --> 00:27:14.577
And if we bend a
few Capitol laws,

513
00:27:14.602 --> 00:27:16.637
we could even have
them place bets.

514
00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:21.231
Look, I know Lucy Gray
may not win in the arena

515
00:27:21.256 --> 00:27:23.625
but if you give her a chance,

516
00:27:24.557 --> 00:27:25.858
I would bet the Plinth Prize

517
00:27:25.883 --> 00:27:27.885
that she can win
people's attention.

518
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.912
I'd like you to
write up a proposal

519
00:27:29.937 --> 00:27:32.239
of these thoughts
tonight, Mr. Snow.

520
00:27:32.264 --> 00:27:33.666
Wait.

521
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:36.460
You mean you might
actually use his ideas?

522
00:27:36.485 --> 00:27:38.553
If it'll help the
ratings, why not.

523
00:27:38.578 --> 00:27:42.875
Coriolanus and I are
class partners, Dr. Gaul.

524
00:27:42.907 --> 00:27:45.009
We do all of our
assignments together.

525
00:27:49.364 --> 00:27:52.099
It'll be an interesting test.

526
00:28:00.875 --> 00:28:02.445
You trying to fatten
that poor girl up

527
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.405
so you can finally
start taking bets?

528
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.633
You think they'll give
those kids a scrap

529
00:28:06.658 --> 00:28:08.760
if we don't give them
a reason to do it?

530
00:28:08.785 --> 00:28:11.722
How do you think your tribute will
have a chance if he can't eat?

531
00:28:19.394 --> 00:28:21.363
He was my classmate.

532
00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:23.237
Back in 2.

533
00:28:23.566 --> 00:28:25.668
- It's not your fault it's him.
- See, I know.

534
00:28:25.693 --> 00:28:27.795
I'm so blameless,
I'm choking on it.

535
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.265
My father bought him for me,
you know, at the Reaping,

536
00:28:32.947 --> 00:28:34.625
Just so he could show me

537
00:28:34.688 --> 00:28:37.124
that I could never go back to 2.

538
00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:42.553
But being Capitol
is gonna kill me.

539
00:28:42.578 --> 00:28:44.513
So do something about it.

540
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.882
Quite the rebel.

541
00:28:51.907 --> 00:28:52.941
Oh, yeah.

542
00:28:54.368 --> 00:28:55.570
I'm bad news.

543
00:29:08.959 --> 00:29:11.361
Marcus. Hey.

544
00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:13.485
It's me.

545
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.811
Marcus, look.

546
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.638
Here, I got some food for you.

547
00:29:17.764 --> 00:29:18.765
Here.

548
00:29:20.718 --> 00:29:21.719
Come on.

549
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:23.985
Marcus.

550
00:29:33.635 --> 00:29:34.837
Is that for us?

551
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.237
Jessup.

552
00:29:42.262 --> 00:29:43.524
I'm not hungry.

553
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:46.118
You think I can't hear your
stomach growling, Jessup Diggs?

554
00:29:46.143 --> 00:29:47.144
Come on.

555
00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:54.654
What happened to his neck?

556
00:29:55.457 --> 00:29:56.791
A bat bite.

557
00:29:58.018 --> 00:29:59.753
The first night on the train,

558
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:02.592
he didn't sleep a
wink the whole journey

559
00:30:02.617 --> 00:30:04.016
'cause he was keeping
the bats off me,

560
00:30:04.041 --> 00:30:05.211
so I would get some rest.

561
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:09.224
Can you take it?

562
00:30:09.249 --> 00:30:11.218
Come on, try harder than that.

563
00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:14.045
One thing I learned in 12
is that hunger is a weapon.

564
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.672
Your friend over
there sure knows it.

565
00:30:15.697 --> 00:30:16.765
She is not my friend.

566
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.126
She is poison with
perfect teeth.

567
00:30:21.212 --> 00:30:24.715
Are you gonna share everything
that I give you with Jessup?

568
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.342
Wh... Why?

569
00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:29.604
You think I ought to build up my strength
so I can strangle him in the arena?

570
00:30:29.629 --> 00:30:30.860
Not exactly my forte.

571
00:30:30.885 --> 00:30:33.387
I might have a
chance to help you.

572
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.520
To make some suggestions
to the Gamemakers.

573
00:30:36.623 --> 00:30:41.180
I might even be able to get the
audience to send you gifts in the arena.

574
00:30:41.205 --> 00:30:44.507
Food and water to
keep you going.

575
00:30:44.739 --> 00:30:47.075
You just have to
try singing again

576
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.135
to win people over.

577
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.261
I don't sing when I'm told.

578
00:30:49.286 --> 00:30:50.686
I sing when I have
something to say.

579
00:30:50.711 --> 00:30:53.414
Besides, I've seen your arena.
There's nowhere to hide.

580
00:30:53.439 --> 00:30:54.707
What's the point?

581
00:30:56.449 --> 00:30:57.560
The guards say you get money

582
00:30:57.585 --> 00:30:58.825
if you get more people to watch

583
00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.652
and you say you wanna
help me. Which is it?

584
00:31:03.373 --> 00:31:04.474
Both.

585
00:31:07.572 --> 00:31:08.707
One more time.

586
00:31:08.958 --> 00:31:10.493
I'm not playing this game.

587
00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:12.876
Come on.

588
00:31:14.694 --> 00:31:15.895
You shut up.

589
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.889
- Uh... No, thank you.
- I saw you staring.

590
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:19.451
Please.

591
00:31:20.957 --> 00:31:22.225
Give me something.

592
00:31:22.593 --> 00:31:24.595
I've been sitting
here for 15 minutes!

593
00:31:25.073 --> 00:31:27.038
Always thought there was
plenty of food in the Capitol.

594
00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:29.859
You know, one time,
during the war,

595
00:31:29.884 --> 00:31:32.954
I ate a whole jar of paste just
to stop the pain in my stomach.

596
00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:34.720
And how was it?

597
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.955
Pasty.

598
00:31:44.722 --> 00:31:45.923
That little one.

599
00:31:46.108 --> 00:31:48.010
She's so sweet.

600
00:31:48.332 --> 00:31:49.834
So young.

601
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.800
Something about her reminds
me of my cousin Maude Ivory.

602
00:31:55.508 --> 00:31:58.276
I can't stand to think of
them without me like this.

603
00:31:58.979 --> 00:32:00.246
I'm sorry.

604
00:32:06.246 --> 00:32:08.547
You seem like a good
man, Coriolanus Snow.

605
00:32:11.692 --> 00:32:13.128
Sure would've been
nice to meet you

606
00:32:13.153 --> 00:32:14.454
under different circumstances.

607
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:18.358
- One of your shows, maybe.
- Yeah.

608
00:32:19.097 --> 00:32:20.965
We could have had a drink.

609
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.357
A dance or two.

610
00:32:23.907 --> 00:32:25.442
Like we had all the
time in the world.

611
00:32:25.467 --> 00:32:26.544
Come on, just take it.

612
00:32:30.279 --> 00:32:32.080
Help!

613
00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:33.340
No, no, no!

614
00:32:35.692 --> 00:32:37.594
It's okay. It's okay.
Hold on. Hold on.

615
00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:38.887
Hey, look at me.

616
00:32:38.912 --> 00:32:41.063
Hey, hold on. It's
okay. I'll get help.

617
00:32:41.088 --> 00:32:42.522
Somebody help us, please!

618
00:32:49.124 --> 00:32:50.691
Wha...

619
00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.012
- Let's go.
- Oh, no.

620
00:33:03.726 --> 00:33:05.695
<i>It's starting again.</i>

621
00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:09.403
This is how it begins.

622
00:33:09.474 --> 00:33:11.577
- The war.
- It was my fault.

623
00:33:11.602 --> 00:33:14.438
I suggested we get
closer to the tributes.

624
00:33:14.463 --> 00:33:17.134
You're just lucky
that your songbird

625
00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:18.828
didn't peck out your eyes too.

626
00:33:18.853 --> 00:33:20.922
She's not a rebel, Grandma'am.

627
00:33:20.947 --> 00:33:23.149
She's just a girl.

628
00:33:23.174 --> 00:33:26.612
Trust me, that one hasn't
been a girl in a long time.

629
00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:30.610
Outside this Capitol,

630
00:33:30.635 --> 00:33:32.435
they're savages,

631
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.862
one and all.

632
00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:36.957
However, they may smile,

633
00:33:36.982 --> 00:33:38.917
she will use you.

634
00:33:38.942 --> 00:33:41.210
You must use her

635
00:33:41.235 --> 00:33:45.540
or you'll end up dead in
the trees like your father.

636
00:34:04.417 --> 00:34:06.287
This is for Dr. Gaul, please.

637
00:34:06.312 --> 00:34:11.717
In spite of yesterday's
tragic events,

638
00:34:11.742 --> 00:34:16.047
our president has decided
that the Games must go on

639
00:34:16.135 --> 00:34:17.603
to show everyone the Capitol

640
00:34:17.628 --> 00:34:19.663
is unafraid of such
acts of terror.

641
00:34:20.011 --> 00:34:22.508
To which end, Dr. Gaul wishes
you to preview the arena

642
00:34:22.533 --> 00:34:24.936
this afternoon
with your tributes.

643
00:34:24.961 --> 00:34:25.995
Later this evening,

644
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.274
there will be a special
televised presentation

645
00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:30.803
of each tribute to our
audience to, you know,

646
00:34:30.828 --> 00:34:32.138
get to know them.

647
00:34:32.163 --> 00:34:34.365
You will have an hour
to discuss strategy.

648
00:34:43.538 --> 00:34:44.774
You may begin.

649
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.174
Marcus, come on.

650
00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.003
You and I aren't
gonna be friends,

651
00:34:54.028 --> 00:34:55.964
but I'm gonna win,

652
00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.356
and for that to happen,

653
00:34:57.381 --> 00:35:00.384
we need to make you more...

654
00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:01.376
marketable.

655
00:35:01.413 --> 00:35:03.849
I'm a really good climber.

656
00:35:03.914 --> 00:35:06.984
I used to climb in my
mama's factory all the time.

657
00:35:14.685 --> 00:35:16.486
It's getting infected.

658
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.097
I'm fine.

659
00:35:18.738 --> 00:35:20.907
Look at me, Lamina.

660
00:35:20.932 --> 00:35:22.985
I want you to win.

661
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.580
It's Reaper, right?

662
00:35:27.178 --> 00:35:28.746
Um, let me read you what...

663
00:35:32.768 --> 00:35:34.904
I'm so sorry about
your classmate.

664
00:35:35.813 --> 00:35:36.881
Thank you.

665
00:35:37.718 --> 00:35:39.054
Are you okay?

666
00:35:40.353 --> 00:35:41.588
Wearing my mama's dress

667
00:35:41.613 --> 00:35:42.958
is the only thing
keeping me together here.

668
00:35:42.983 --> 00:35:46.053
It's like she's wrapping
her arms around me.

669
00:35:47.486 --> 00:35:50.123
My mother, she used
to smell like roses.

670
00:35:52.199 --> 00:35:53.800
She died in childbirth.

671
00:35:54.856 --> 00:35:56.925
I was going to have
a little sister.

672
00:35:57.583 --> 00:35:59.152
Both your parents gone?

673
00:36:03.043 --> 00:36:05.112
So, you're an orphan.

674
00:36:05.137 --> 00:36:06.537
Like me.

675
00:36:08.747 --> 00:36:09.748
Look...

676
00:36:11.381 --> 00:36:14.886
I need you to sing in
these interviews later.

677
00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:17.453
It's the night before the Games

678
00:36:17.478 --> 00:36:20.131
and your last chance
to win people over.

679
00:36:21.319 --> 00:36:22.594
I can't send you
gifts in the arena

680
00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:24.297
without their money.

681
00:36:24.322 --> 00:36:28.827
Maybe a guitar could
persuade me. Maybe.

682
00:36:28.852 --> 00:36:32.305
You really wanna take care of
me in that arena, Coriolanus?

683
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.800
Start by thinking
I can actually win.

684
00:36:36.136 --> 00:36:37.570
Snow. Dovecote.

685
00:36:38.652 --> 00:36:40.553
She can't expect
us to have written

686
00:36:40.578 --> 00:36:42.814
that proposal last
night, can she?

687
00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:44.908
I was crying for hours.

688
00:36:44.933 --> 00:36:47.903
We did... write it.

689
00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:49.247
I turned it in this morning.

690
00:36:49.272 --> 00:36:50.941
All right, give me
the bullet points.

691
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.677
Mr. Snow.

692
00:37:08.756 --> 00:37:10.356
Ms. Dovecote.

693
00:37:10.921 --> 00:37:12.790
Come and see my new babies.

694
00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:35.278
Is there a point to the color?

695
00:37:35.303 --> 00:37:37.606
There's a point to
everything, Ms. Dovecote,

696
00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:39.140
or to nothing at all.

697
00:37:39.165 --> 00:37:42.436
Which brings me neatly
to your proposal.

698
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:45.618
Which one of you
actually wrote it?

699
00:37:45.643 --> 00:37:48.312
- Well, there was...
- I was inspired

700
00:37:48.337 --> 00:37:50.504
by Coriolanus
yesterday, of course.

701
00:37:50.529 --> 00:37:53.498
His little betting idea.

702
00:37:53.523 --> 00:37:57.661
But the sponsorships and
the gifts in the arena,

703
00:37:57.957 --> 00:37:59.824
- those were all mine.
- Clemmie?

704
00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:02.901
So it's your sweaty handwriting

705
00:38:02.926 --> 00:38:04.672
on that page.

706
00:38:04.809 --> 00:38:07.477
Very impressive, Ms. Dovecote.

707
00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:10.032
Unfortunately, my
assistant mistook it

708
00:38:10.057 --> 00:38:11.859
for trash this morning

709
00:38:11.884 --> 00:38:15.754
and lined the shelf of this
very terrarium with it.

710
00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:20.150
So, please, Ms. Dovecote,
retrieve it for us, won't you?

711
00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:23.712
So we might all consider
your inspired ideas.

712
00:38:25.398 --> 00:38:26.567
Don't worry,

713
00:38:26.592 --> 00:38:29.962
my little predators
are perfectly docile

714
00:38:29.987 --> 00:38:32.421
with those they can trust.

715
00:38:32.446 --> 00:38:35.288
So if they're used
to your scent,

716
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:38.258
if you've handled their
food, for example,

717
00:38:38.283 --> 00:38:41.052
or if they've inhaled
the sweat of your palm

718
00:38:41.077 --> 00:38:43.280
on a page,

719
00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:44.741
they'll leave you alone.

720
00:38:45.354 --> 00:38:47.690
A new scent, however...

721
00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:53.996
you'd be on your
own, little girl.

722
00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:55.838
Retrieve it.

723
00:38:59.377 --> 00:39:00.378
Clemmie.

724
00:39:08.245 --> 00:39:09.613
Clemmie, no! No!

725
00:39:12.394 --> 00:39:15.262
You asked about the
colors, Ms. Dovecote?

726
00:39:15.287 --> 00:39:18.149
I want my enemies to see
a rainbow of destruction

727
00:39:18.174 --> 00:39:19.809
engulfing the world.

728
00:39:20.637 --> 00:39:24.375
I'm not above using spectacle
to create a little terror.

729
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.477
A strategy your classmate here

730
00:39:26.502 --> 00:39:29.872
articulated very
well in his proposal.

731
00:39:31.574 --> 00:39:34.376
They're good, your suggestions.

732
00:39:34.401 --> 00:39:36.069
I'm going to recommend my team

733
00:39:36.094 --> 00:39:39.831
implement as many as
possible tomorrow.

734
00:39:41.158 --> 00:39:42.493
What?

735
00:39:43.718 --> 00:39:45.286
Will she die?

736
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.431
The pleasure in breaking ground

737
00:39:47.456 --> 00:39:50.627
in one's research is
one gets to find out.

738
00:39:50.809 --> 00:39:53.611
You better keep Ms.
Dovecote's fate between us.

739
00:39:53.636 --> 00:39:55.703
I don't think her mother
would be happy to learn

740
00:39:55.728 --> 00:39:57.897
how she caught this sudden...

741
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.160
flu.

742
00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:03.728
Now run along, you have
an arena to promote

743
00:40:03.753 --> 00:40:06.622
and it's time for my
milk and crackers.

744
00:40:20.677 --> 00:40:22.546
All right, let's go.

745
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:32.949
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

746
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.485
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

747
00:40:39.743 --> 00:40:41.545
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

748
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:43.841
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

749
00:40:44.505 --> 00:40:46.507
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

750
00:40:46.932 --> 00:40:48.433
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

751
00:40:52.477 --> 00:40:54.980
Come with me. Hey, you.

752
00:40:55.005 --> 00:40:57.441
Get that camera on her. Coral.

753
00:41:22.827 --> 00:41:24.168
<i>Welcome to the arena</i>

754
00:41:24.193 --> 00:41:25.782
<i>for the 10th annual
Hunger Games.</i>

755
00:41:25.807 --> 00:41:27.008
<i>Tributes, mentors,</i>

756
00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:30.303
<i>you have 15 minutes to survey
the space and discuss strategy.</i>

757
00:41:30.328 --> 00:41:33.130
Dill, you stick
by me, understand?

758
00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:37.997
Hey, lumberjack.

759
00:41:39.754 --> 00:41:40.788
Lamina.

760
00:41:41.514 --> 00:41:42.849
No, no, just you.

761
00:41:43.637 --> 00:41:44.638
Just you.

762
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:57.155
Jessup?

763
00:41:58.036 --> 00:41:59.604
Jessup.

764
00:42:02.203 --> 00:42:03.649
Please.

765
00:42:04.129 --> 00:42:06.965
Coriolanus, please don't
let me die in here tomorrow.

766
00:42:11.103 --> 00:42:12.305
Oh, shit!

767
00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:47.807
Help me!

768
00:42:52.064 --> 00:42:53.532
The gate's out!

769
00:42:56.108 --> 00:42:57.376
The gate's out.

770
00:42:57.952 --> 00:43:01.189
The gate's blown open.

771
00:43:15.157 --> 00:43:17.526
Come on, the gate's open.

772
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.852
Come on. He wouldn't save you.

773
00:43:22.127 --> 00:43:24.361
We've got runners!

774
00:43:49.107 --> 00:43:50.308
Coryo.

775
00:43:53.046 --> 00:43:54.347
Lucy Gray?

776
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.519
- Is she...
- She's alive.

777
00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:02.475
What happened?

778
00:44:02.501 --> 00:44:04.110
It was a rebel bombing.

779
00:44:04.835 --> 00:44:08.106
They must have been
planning it for months.

780
00:44:08.373 --> 00:44:09.707
Four tributes were killed.

781
00:44:09.732 --> 00:44:12.835
Everyone's terrified, Coryo.

782
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.697
People are locking themselves
inside their houses.

783
00:44:16.722 --> 00:44:19.525
Felix Ravinstill's
on life support.

784
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.556
The rebels released a message.

785
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:26.784
They said they wanted to tear down the
symbol of the Hunger Games on live TV.

786
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:28.687
<i>...savagely and
cowardly attacked us...</i>

787
00:44:28.712 --> 00:44:30.015
Marcus got out.

788
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.476
<i>gravely injuring
the president's...</i>

789
00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:32.476
He's the only one.

790
00:44:32.501 --> 00:44:35.337
Peacekeepers are hunting
him in the streets but

791
00:44:35.362 --> 00:44:37.165
at least he has a
better chance out there

792
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.159
- than he would tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

793
00:44:39.184 --> 00:44:41.819
They're not still going
ahead with the Games?

794
00:44:42.621 --> 00:44:44.991
Oh, no, Lucy Gray.

795
00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:46.867
Lucy Gray could've run.

796
00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:50.062
<i>- The show will go on.</i>
- But she saved me.

797
00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:51.878
<i>And now our final tribute.</i>

798
00:44:51.903 --> 00:44:55.164
<i>I first met this
young lady in the zoo</i>

799
00:44:55.189 --> 00:44:57.024
<i>not too long ago.</i>

800
00:44:57.049 --> 00:44:59.051
<i>- From District 12...</i>
- Coryo.

801
00:44:59.076 --> 00:45:00.711
<i>Lucy Gray Baird.</i>

802
00:45:00.736 --> 00:45:03.138
<i>Come out here with that
guitar, you songbird.</i>

803
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:12.057
<i>Good evening,

804
00:45:12.347 --> 00:45:14.349

805
00:45:14.374 --> 00:45:16.144

826
00:46:34.382 --> 00:46:35.684
Thank you for being here.

827
00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:37.845
<i>Ms. Lucy Gray, District 12.</i>

828
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.704
Both of you.

829
00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:39.758
It's what friends do.

830
00:46:39.783 --> 00:46:41.986
<i>How wonderful is this night</i>

831
00:46:42.011 --> 00:46:44.226
<i>that we all get to be here for
someone's final performance.</i>

832
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:45.851
<i>Ms. Lucy Gray, thank you.</i>

833
00:46:45.876 --> 00:46:47.744
<i>Go home, go to bed, get
a good night's sleep.</i>

834
00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:49.537
<i>You've got a big day tomorrow.</i>

835
00:47:58.525 --> 00:47:59.859
<i>Lucy Gray.</i>

836
00:48:00.218 --> 00:48:01.451
Lucy Gray.

837
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.548
- Hey.
- You're alive.

838
00:48:04.573 --> 00:48:07.743
Those bombs, they have
changed everything.

839
00:48:07.768 --> 00:48:09.403
They blew the walls out.

840
00:48:09.437 --> 00:48:12.040
So that means you can
escape up into the stands.

841
00:48:12.065 --> 00:48:13.732
There's a hole
down in the floor.

842
00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:15.459
Leads down to some
tunnels. I've tried it

843
00:48:15.484 --> 00:48:17.286
and you can
disappear down there.

844
00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:20.748
So the moment you hear that bell ring,
you ignore the weapons in the middle

845
00:48:20.773 --> 00:48:24.375
and you run as fast as
you can for that hole.

846
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.536
And you find a place to
hide down below. Alone.

847
00:48:28.444 --> 00:48:29.512
- Alone? No.
- Yeah.

848
00:48:29.545 --> 00:48:30.881
- Jessup's my friend.
- No.

849
00:48:30.906 --> 00:48:32.908
The moment that bell rings,
you can't trust anyone.

850
00:48:32.933 --> 00:48:34.400
Not even Jessup.

851
00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:38.279
Just lay low down there
until it's safe to come out.

852
00:48:38.304 --> 00:48:41.441
Thank you for taking care of me.

853
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:44.127
I can't let you die.

854
00:48:44.717 --> 00:48:46.618
You saved me.

855
00:48:46.643 --> 00:48:49.146
You saved me, Lucy Gray.

856
00:48:51.779 --> 00:48:54.271
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

857
00:48:54.296 --> 00:48:56.131
I'm more hopeful
during the daytime,

858
00:48:56.156 --> 00:48:57.959
but when it gets dark, I just...

859
00:48:57.984 --> 00:48:59.184
It's okay.

860
00:49:02.369 --> 00:49:03.370
It's okay.

861
00:49:06.075 --> 00:49:07.911
I am gonna get you out of here.

862
00:49:09.023 --> 00:49:10.024
I promise.

863
00:49:12.738 --> 00:49:14.540
Back to the Covey, okay?

864
00:49:26.972 --> 00:49:27.973
Is this real?

865
00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:31.209
Just tell me.

866
00:49:31.243 --> 00:49:34.645
If I'm gonna risk
everything. That song...

867
00:49:34.678 --> 00:49:37.448
That song was
payback, that's all.

868
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:38.783
My old boyfriend, Billy Taupe,

869
00:49:38.808 --> 00:49:40.718
he was cheating on me
with the mayor's daughter.

870
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:42.930
- The girl from the Reaping.
- Yeah, she got crazy jealous.

871
00:49:42.954 --> 00:49:44.722
She had her pa read my
name up on that stage

872
00:49:44.755 --> 00:49:47.358
and now everyone will
know what they did to me.

873
00:49:51.096 --> 00:49:52.296
Here.

874
00:49:54.398 --> 00:49:55.733
You take this.

875
00:49:55.766 --> 00:49:58.369
- No, no, it's too fine.
- No, it is not a gift.

876
00:49:58.402 --> 00:50:00.071
It's a loan.

877
00:50:00.105 --> 00:50:02.107
What's in here, don't touch it.

878
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.163
Don't even breathe it in

879
00:50:03.188 --> 00:50:04.740
because small amounts
can be deadly.

880
00:50:06.377 --> 00:50:09.655
Look, I have seen what
war does to people, okay?

881
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.816
I've seen it.

882
00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:13.350
And there will come a
time when you need this.

883
00:50:13.384 --> 00:50:15.653
When you need to act.

884
00:50:15.686 --> 00:50:18.389
We all do things we're
not proud of to survive.

885
00:50:20.258 --> 00:50:21.679
Hey.

886
00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.796
We are gonna win
this, Lucy Gray.

887
00:50:27.128 --> 00:50:28.695
We're gonna win this together.

888
00:50:42.934 --> 00:50:44.670
Wake up! On your feet!

889
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.655
Jessup.

890
00:51:02.234 --> 00:51:04.735
That friend of yours. Plinth.

891
00:51:04.768 --> 00:51:07.973
You might wanna find him
a seat near the door.

892
00:51:11.375 --> 00:51:12.911
Coryo.

893
00:51:13.912 --> 00:51:15.679
-Hey.
-How you doing? You all right?

894
00:51:15.713 --> 00:51:17.073
- Better.
- Over here, please.

895
00:51:20.384 --> 00:51:21.585
Better.

896
00:51:25.223 --> 00:51:27.092
Tell me this will
be over quickly.

897
00:51:30.061 --> 00:51:32.163
What is this? The mines?

898
00:51:32.197 --> 00:51:34.698
I... I gotta get my
tools. Pa said...

899
00:51:37.335 --> 00:51:38.511
<i>Here we go. Here
we go, everyone.</i>

900
00:51:38.535 --> 00:51:40.404
Come on. Come on, let's go.

901
00:51:40.437 --> 00:51:41.705
Sit down, Festus, come on.

902
00:51:41.739 --> 00:51:45.277
Everyone, as you know,
we're about to go live.

903
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.644
Just because you're not hosting,

904
00:51:46.677 --> 00:51:48.545
doesn't mean you're
off the hook. Help me.

905
00:51:48.579 --> 00:51:50.382
Don't get lost
behind your screens.

906
00:51:50.414 --> 00:51:52.416
No yawning, no gum chewing.

907
00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:55.632
Keep your chins down,
heads up, shoulders back.

908
00:51:55.657 --> 00:51:57.126
And smile.

909
00:51:57.151 --> 00:51:58.786
It's why we have teeth.

910
00:52:00.225 --> 00:52:02.227
Okay. Ready? We're
gonna start, guys.

911
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.528
Five, four,

912
00:52:04.561 --> 00:52:06.331
three, two...

913
00:52:14.973 --> 00:52:20.030
Good morning, I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman.

914
00:52:20.055 --> 00:52:22.456
A man who needs no introduction.

915
00:52:22.481 --> 00:52:25.250
Weatherman, amateur magician,

916
00:52:25.283 --> 00:52:26.750
and today,

917
00:52:28.519 --> 00:52:30.488
I'm honored to say...

918
00:52:30.513 --> 00:52:33.918
first ever host of
the Hunger Games.

919
00:52:35.335 --> 00:52:37.772
In my hand, an envelope, sealed.

920
00:52:37.797 --> 00:52:41.133
My prediction, the
winner to be opened by me

921
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.659
upon the big show's end.

922
00:52:42.684 --> 00:52:44.485
Well, well...

923
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:45.744
They're here. We're
getting word...

924
00:52:45.769 --> 00:52:46.948
All right, we're about to start.

925
00:52:46.972 --> 00:52:48.249
We're starting,
everyone, we're starting.

926
00:52:48.273 --> 00:52:49.616
Happy Hunger Games.
Happy Hunger...

927
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.977
Remember, when your tribute
dies, get out of here.

928
00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:00.060
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

929
00:53:00.085 --> 00:53:02.653
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

930
00:53:05.681 --> 00:53:07.016
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

931
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:29.410
<i>Stand on your mark
or you will be shot.</i>

932
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.081
Move.

933
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:13.300
Ooh! Marcus.

934
00:54:13.325 --> 00:54:16.695
Guess we can all sleep better
now knowing he's off the streets.

935
00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.215
You're monsters!

936
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.875
All of you!

937
00:54:27.444 --> 00:54:30.414
Ten, nine...

938
00:54:30.439 --> 00:54:34.678
... <i>eight, seven, six,</i>

939
00:54:35.534 --> 00:54:37.070
<i>- five...</i>
- Jessup.

940
00:54:37.095 --> 00:54:38.495
<i>four,</i>

941
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.822
<i>- three...</i>
- Jessup.

942
00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:42.492
<i>two,</i>

943
00:54:43.036 --> 00:54:44.336
<i>one.</i>

944
00:54:46.715 --> 00:54:47.582
Run.

945
00:54:51.099 --> 00:54:52.299
Jessup!

946
00:54:52.612 --> 00:54:54.046
Jessup!

947
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:56.073
What are you doing? Run.

948
00:55:02.157 --> 00:55:03.357
Jess...

949
00:55:10.468 --> 00:55:11.502
Jessup!

950
00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:37.571
Jessup!

951
00:55:49.066 --> 00:55:50.299
Jessup!

952
00:55:51.576 --> 00:55:53.377
Jessup! Jessup, we
gotta go, come on.

953
00:55:53.402 --> 00:55:55.442
We should get out of here.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

954
00:55:59.574 --> 00:56:01.152
They've gone underground
very quickly,

955
00:56:01.177 --> 00:56:02.513
but we're prepared for this.

956
00:56:02.538 --> 00:56:04.044
- Go, go, go.
- What you're seeing now

957
00:56:04.068 --> 00:56:05.677
is a live feed of
security cameras.

958
00:56:05.702 --> 00:56:07.839
Come on!

959
00:56:10.148 --> 00:56:11.183
Come on!

960
00:56:12.801 --> 00:56:14.152
Go, go, go.

961
00:56:16.996 --> 00:56:18.196
This way.

962
00:56:18.221 --> 00:56:19.597
Hy and Sol from
the other side,

963
00:56:19.622 --> 00:56:21.023
pincering in on Lucy Gray.

964
00:56:23.245 --> 00:56:24.280
Come on.

965
00:56:29.529 --> 00:56:31.664
No! Please, no!

966
00:56:31.689 --> 00:56:32.824
No!

967
00:56:32.849 --> 00:56:35.384
Here comes the Pack,
surprising Hy and Sol.

968
00:56:36.871 --> 00:56:38.204
No!

969
00:56:38.996 --> 00:56:40.330
Come on.

970
00:56:47.373 --> 00:56:50.109
Hey, lumberjack, get in
there and get her out.

971
00:56:50.134 --> 00:56:51.711
I'm not sticking
my head in there.

972
00:56:51.736 --> 00:56:53.238
She could be waiting
with a brick.

973
00:56:53.325 --> 00:56:56.228
<i>I knew we should have
recruited that Reaper kid.</i>

974
00:57:03.146 --> 00:57:04.713
Do you think they're done?

975
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:07.176
Looks like it.

976
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.449
To the children watching,
that was violent,

977
00:57:11.474 --> 00:57:14.097
horrific, and disgusting.

978
00:57:14.122 --> 00:57:15.691
Ms. Phipps,

979
00:57:15.716 --> 00:57:19.053
please, if you're going to
vomit, do it off camera.

980
00:57:19.078 --> 00:57:20.746
Thirteen tributes remain.

981
00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:23.874
Reaper still looming
large on top of the charts

982
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:26.535
while Coral and her
Pack try to make a play.

983
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.462
Six tributes gone in minutes.

984
00:57:29.498 --> 00:57:31.433
If they keep it up at this pace,

985
00:57:31.458 --> 00:57:33.494
we're gonna be outta
here in no time.

986
00:57:34.736 --> 00:57:37.138
Now, these record
high temperatures

987
00:57:37.163 --> 00:57:38.798
aren't doing that
fire that continues

988
00:57:38.823 --> 00:57:41.826
to burn out here in
District 9 any favors.

989
00:57:41.851 --> 00:57:43.119
I'll keep an eye on it.

990
00:57:43.144 --> 00:57:44.579
In District 10,

991
00:57:44.604 --> 00:57:47.941
this warm front is gonna
come down and collide here,

992
00:57:47.966 --> 00:57:49.468
squeezing out some drizzle.

993
00:57:49.493 --> 00:57:52.963
And finally, in
District 12, a...

994
00:57:58.439 --> 00:58:00.153
Lamina.

995
00:58:37.993 --> 00:58:39.394
Please.

996
00:58:40.412 --> 00:58:41.747
Please.

997
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:01.759
Yes!

998
00:59:12.169 --> 00:59:14.204
Cold pressure system's
gonna swoop on in,

999
00:59:14.229 --> 00:59:16.931
bringing cooler temperatures
and some much needed relief

1000
00:59:16.956 --> 00:59:19.675
to our coal miners out there,
at least until early evening.

1001
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.368
That's the weather.

1002
00:59:21.584 --> 00:59:24.119
Was it mercy? Was it murder?

1003
00:59:25.385 --> 00:59:28.287
Either way, that's what
happens when you do stuff.

1004
00:59:29.279 --> 00:59:30.713
You get attention.

1005
00:59:31.814 --> 00:59:33.081
Citizens send you money.

1006
00:59:33.106 --> 00:59:34.808
Now, once they get your money,

1007
00:59:34.833 --> 00:59:38.737
the mentor can choose
to send in food or water

1008
00:59:38.762 --> 00:59:41.795
using our newly developed
drones from the war,

1009
00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:43.855
reprogrammed with
facial recognition.

1010
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.851
This ensures that your package
goes directly to your tribute.

1011
00:59:47.876 --> 00:59:49.308
Isn't that right,
Pup Harrington?

1012
00:59:49.333 --> 00:59:50.734
Yeah.

1013
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.081
I've got a hunch Pup is
gonna seize the opportunity.

1014
01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:14.200
What?

1015
01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:33.373
Uh, we have a reservation
tonight. Flickerman.

1016
01:00:33.398 --> 01:00:34.799
Party of two and a high chair.

1017
01:00:34.824 --> 01:00:38.194
We will not be there,
um, on time. I'm sorry.

1018
01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:39.697
I'm... I'm hosting
the Hunger Games...

1019
01:00:39.722 --> 01:00:41.056
10th annual,

1020
01:00:41.081 --> 01:00:43.370
and it's going a little bit
longer than anticipated,

1021
01:00:43.395 --> 01:00:44.792
so I'm curious to know

1022
01:00:44.817 --> 01:00:47.019
if you have anything
later tonight.

1023
01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:48.792
You do. Great.
I will be there.

1024
01:00:48.817 --> 01:00:49.852
Because this...

1025
01:00:49.877 --> 01:00:52.214
If not... If you don't
see me, I'm not there.

1026
01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:54.674
You can't save
her by watching.

1027
01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:57.430
What do you want from that girl?

1028
01:00:57.455 --> 01:00:59.356
- Nothing. I want her to live.
- Mmm.

1029
01:01:01.089 --> 01:01:03.636
And the Plinth Prize would
be a happy coincidence,

1030
01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:04.662
I suppose.

1031
01:01:07.061 --> 01:01:09.764
I believe I'd be entitled to it.

1032
01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:13.573
Of course you do.
Of course you do.

1033
01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:17.611
The prize, the girl.

1034
01:01:17.636 --> 01:01:20.538
Hmm, how convenient. You don't
have to choose between them.

1035
01:01:20.563 --> 01:01:22.765
Who do you think makes
that final decision

1036
01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:25.722
for the prize you
so covet, Mr. Snow?

1037
01:01:25.747 --> 01:01:27.282
Wake up.

1038
01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:30.557
Even if Lucy Gray Baird
somehow wins it all,

1039
01:01:30.582 --> 01:01:32.984
I will do everything in
my power to ensure that

1040
01:01:33.009 --> 01:01:35.678
you don't see a dime.

1041
01:01:36.224 --> 01:01:38.260
So, ask yourself,

1042
01:01:38.285 --> 01:01:40.721
how much do you care
if she lives now?

1043
01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.644
We gotta be quiet
down here, Jessup.

1044
01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:57.065
I just wanna sleep.

1045
01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.490
You want some water?

1046
01:02:07.793 --> 01:02:09.628
What have you done to it?

1047
01:02:09.653 --> 01:02:12.222
I didn't do anything,
Jessup, I just...

1048
01:02:13.226 --> 01:02:14.626
Are you okay?

1049
01:02:15.826 --> 01:02:16.827
It's okay.

1050
01:02:18.659 --> 01:02:20.895
Jessup, come on.

1051
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.002
Let's go back to sleep, okay?

1052
01:02:24.027 --> 01:02:27.631
I know, I know. It's
okay. It's okay.

1053
01:02:35.617 --> 01:02:37.185
Mr. Snow.

1054
01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.487
What happened?

1055
01:02:39.961 --> 01:02:41.495
Is it Lucy Gray?

1056
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.823
Unless you can put a leash
on your deluded classmate,

1057
01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:48.351
she might as well be dead
as far as you're concerned.

1058
01:02:50.122 --> 01:02:51.422
Sejanus?

1059
01:02:51.447 --> 01:02:53.839
Bread crumbs. I believe

1060
01:02:53.864 --> 01:02:55.698
sustenance for a fallen comrade

1061
01:02:55.723 --> 01:02:57.354
on his final journey.

1062
01:02:57.379 --> 01:02:59.315
A District 2 superstition.

1063
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.708
I'll work on finding the
Peacekeeper he bribed

1064
01:03:01.733 --> 01:03:04.270
to get him in, and
cut out their tongue.

1065
01:03:04.295 --> 01:03:06.331
In the meantime,

1066
01:03:06.356 --> 01:03:09.726
I need someone to get
him out right now.

1067
01:03:09.751 --> 01:03:11.520
You should send Peacekeepers in.

1068
01:03:11.545 --> 01:03:14.823
Only to have him bolt
and hide like a rabbit?

1069
01:03:14.932 --> 01:03:17.068
Felix Ravinstill is
fighting for his life

1070
01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:19.095
in the hospital, Mr. Snow.

1071
01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.723
I will not have these rebels
make a further mockery

1072
01:03:21.748 --> 01:03:23.383
of my Games.

1073
01:03:23.692 --> 01:03:26.695
Anyone sees us lose
control of this arena,

1074
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.558
it might as well be sounding
a horn to the districts

1075
01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:30.751
to revolt.

1076
01:03:31.856 --> 01:03:34.492
You choose to be friends
with this radical.

1077
01:03:35.707 --> 01:03:37.609
You want him to end
the Games tonight?

1078
01:03:37.634 --> 01:03:40.042
It'll look a lot worse if
the tributes kill two of us.

1079
01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:42.268
So don't let them.

1080
01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:45.890
Who knows? You get
him out unscathed,

1081
01:03:45.915 --> 01:03:49.053
I'll whisper your name
in his father's ear.

1082
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:52.631
You still want that
Plinth Prize, don't you?

1083
01:03:53.795 --> 01:03:56.465
I'll freeze the
feed for an hour.

1084
01:03:56.490 --> 01:04:00.161
I estimate that's all we
have until the people notice.

1085
01:04:25.698 --> 01:04:28.011
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

1086
01:05:16.065 --> 01:05:18.234
I thought they'd send my ma.

1087
01:05:19.157 --> 01:05:20.691
Yeah, I wish they had.

1088
01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:26.593
You need to go, Coryo.

1089
01:05:26.618 --> 01:05:29.055
I'd like to. I really would.

1090
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.714
But I promised I'd get you out.

1091
01:05:31.465 --> 01:05:32.533
Why?

1092
01:05:33.444 --> 01:05:35.847
Because you're my friend.

1093
01:05:35.918 --> 01:05:38.553
I have to do this. I had to
go where the cameras are.

1094
01:05:38.578 --> 01:05:41.182
You think anyone's
watching this?

1095
01:05:41.207 --> 01:05:43.042
Gaul cut the feed.

1096
01:05:43.067 --> 01:05:46.470
Tributes kill you in here, she's
just gonna say you died of the flu.

1097
01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:53.510
You need to decide right now.

1098
01:05:53.535 --> 01:05:55.205
Do you wanna fight
these tributes,

1099
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:56.597
or fight for them?

1100
01:05:56.622 --> 01:05:58.258
Because if you wanna
make real change,

1101
01:05:58.283 --> 01:05:59.526
you need to stay alive to do it.

1102
01:05:59.551 --> 01:06:01.820
How can I make any
change from out there?

1103
01:06:01.845 --> 01:06:03.247
You're rich.

1104
01:06:03.272 --> 01:06:05.807
Smart. You care.

1105
01:06:05.832 --> 01:06:07.253
You're the only one
who stood up to Gaul

1106
01:06:07.278 --> 01:06:08.612
in that class, right?

1107
01:06:13.207 --> 01:06:16.144
We're dead if we
don't leave right now.

1108
01:06:16.169 --> 01:06:18.159
Come with me.

1109
01:06:18.184 --> 01:06:21.386
Spend your father's
money, do some real good.

1110
01:06:21.448 --> 01:06:23.851
Or just be another dead
body in Gaul's war.

1111
01:06:25.056 --> 01:06:26.256
Please.

1112
01:06:27.141 --> 01:06:28.341
Trust me.

1113
01:06:30.241 --> 01:06:31.242
I...

1114
01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:34.269
Go! Go!

1115
01:06:37.566 --> 01:06:38.600
Run!

1116
01:06:47.507 --> 01:06:49.542
Come on, get up! To the gate!

1117
01:06:54.647 --> 01:06:55.749
I don't wanna hurt you!

1118
01:06:58.994 --> 01:07:01.296
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

1119
01:07:14.224 --> 01:07:15.424
Come on, get up.

1120
01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:18.843
- Go!
- Move it!

1121
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:22.072
Open the gate! Open the gate!

1122
01:07:29.816 --> 01:07:31.818
Watch those screens, gorgeous.

1123
01:07:31.843 --> 01:07:34.880
'Cause I may have
missed you tonight,

1124
01:07:34.905 --> 01:07:37.007
but your songbird's
next on my list.

1125
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.402
Let's go.

1126
01:07:44.796 --> 01:07:46.031
I'm... I'm sorry.

1127
01:07:46.211 --> 01:07:47.946
Coryo, I'm so sorry.

1128
01:07:47.971 --> 01:07:49.005
I'm so sorry.

1129
01:07:49.602 --> 01:07:50.636
For all of it.

1130
01:07:57.578 --> 01:07:58.647
My father.

1131
01:08:00.386 --> 01:08:01.889
Let the buying begin.

1132
01:08:10.617 --> 01:08:11.618
Ma!

1133
01:08:14.276 --> 01:08:16.544
I had to do something.

1134
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:28.746
Snow stormed down,

1135
01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:30.106
down on his head.

1136
01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:32.299
It stormed down on his head,

1137
01:08:32.324 --> 01:08:35.729
and now the boy is...

1138
01:08:40.259 --> 01:08:43.061
You've had enough of the
Games tonight, I see.

1139
01:08:44.794 --> 01:08:46.162
Come, sit.

1140
01:08:46.187 --> 01:08:47.453
I'll stitch you up.

1141
01:08:48.527 --> 01:08:51.731
Who could imagine
Crassus Snow's baby boy

1142
01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:55.127
fighting for his life
in the arena one day?

1143
01:08:57.508 --> 01:09:01.479
What happened in there,
that's humanity undressed.

1144
01:09:02.731 --> 01:09:06.401
Fueled with the terror
of becoming prey,

1145
01:09:06.429 --> 01:09:10.166
see how quickly we
become predator.

1146
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:14.096
See how quickly
civilization disappears.

1147
01:09:14.121 --> 01:09:15.956
Those tributes
don't have a choice.

1148
01:09:15.981 --> 01:09:17.650
I was talking about you.

1149
01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:22.691
All your fine manners,
education, background,

1150
01:09:22.716 --> 01:09:25.786
stripped away in
the blink of an eye,

1151
01:09:25.811 --> 01:09:29.148
leaving a boy with a club who
beats another boy to death

1152
01:09:29.173 --> 01:09:30.742
to stay alive.

1153
01:09:36.191 --> 01:09:39.896
You wanna protect
people, Mr. Snow?

1154
01:09:39.921 --> 01:09:41.856
To govern them like your father?

1155
01:09:43.977 --> 01:09:47.781
Then it's essential you
accept what human beings are

1156
01:09:47.845 --> 01:09:50.081
and what it takes
to control them.

1157
01:10:08.156 --> 01:10:10.993
They sent me into the
arena tonight, Tigris.

1158
01:10:11.018 --> 01:10:12.687
What?

1159
01:10:12.846 --> 01:10:14.447
To get Sejanus out.

1160
01:10:15.605 --> 01:10:18.074
What happened? Are you okay?

1161
01:10:18.099 --> 01:10:19.734
I killed one of the tributes.

1162
01:10:21.416 --> 01:10:22.450
A boy.

1163
01:10:23.817 --> 01:10:26.735
It must have been awful.

1164
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.928
It was.

1165
01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.994
Then it felt...

1166
01:10:34.014 --> 01:10:35.381
powerful.

1167
01:10:38.817 --> 01:10:39.884
Coryo.

1168
01:10:41.463 --> 01:10:43.933
I know you wanna
be like your father

1169
01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:48.894
but what I remember
the most about him

1170
01:10:48.919 --> 01:10:51.756
was that in his eyes,

1171
01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:54.217
it was just hate.

1172
01:10:54.242 --> 01:10:56.012
You don't have to
pay the same price

1173
01:10:56.037 --> 01:10:57.939
just to survive.

1174
01:10:57.964 --> 01:10:59.766
People can be good.

1175
01:11:01.589 --> 01:11:04.726
You can be good. You are good.

1176
01:11:05.382 --> 01:11:06.985
Just believe in that.

1177
01:11:12.136 --> 01:11:15.039
<i>Wakey wakey, my
Capitol friends.</i>

1178
01:11:15.064 --> 01:11:18.175
<i>I'm Lucky Flickerman and
welcome to day number two</i>

1179
01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.135
<i>of the 10th annual Hunger Games.</i>

1180
01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:23.987
Now, while most of you were getting
your beauty sleep last night,

1181
01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:26.456
something
scintillating occurred.

1182
01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:28.651
Bobbin from District 8,

1183
01:11:28.892 --> 01:11:30.260
slaughtered.

1184
01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:32.503
Which of these beasts slayed

1185
01:11:32.528 --> 01:11:34.064
Bobbin from District 8?

1186
01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.380
Either way, it doesn't matter.

1187
01:11:35.405 --> 01:11:36.774
10 tributes remain.

1188
01:11:36.799 --> 01:11:39.237
Reaper still at the
top of the boards.

1189
01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:40.292
They aren't showing us

1190
01:11:40.317 --> 01:11:41.651
what happened to
that little boy.

1191
01:11:41.676 --> 01:11:43.010
He clearly was
killed right there.

1192
01:11:43.035 --> 01:11:44.846
There's cameras everywhere.
It doesn't make sense.

1193
01:11:44.871 --> 01:11:47.106
They said they were
old cameras, Lyssie.

1194
01:11:47.131 --> 01:11:48.508
Probably just another
one of Coral's.

1195
01:11:48.533 --> 01:11:50.401
Festus, sit down.

1196
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.590
Same seats.

1197
01:12:05.096 --> 01:12:07.064
<i>- What'd you do to me?</i>
<i>- Nothing!</i>

1198
01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:08.690
Lyssie, what is he doing?

1199
01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:11.150
Something's wrong. He wouldn't
turn on her like this.

1200
01:12:11.187 --> 01:12:12.675
Jessup going after Lucy Gray.

1201
01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.274
Go to the stands,
go to the stands.

1202
01:12:14.299 --> 01:12:16.073
Stop running! What did you...

1203
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:20.027
- What did you do to me?
- I didn't do anything.

1204
01:12:21.011 --> 01:12:23.253
Both tributes
from District 12.

1205
01:12:23.278 --> 01:12:26.047
The same district
folding in on itself.

1206
01:12:26.072 --> 01:12:27.274
Wait, look.

1207
01:12:27.299 --> 01:12:28.399
The foam.

1208
01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:29.498
<i>I didn't do anything to you!</i>

1209
01:12:29.523 --> 01:12:31.059
I think it's rabies.

1210
01:12:31.084 --> 01:12:33.585
That bite. From that train.

1211
01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:35.180
Send him water.

1212
01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:36.450
Wait, what?

1213
01:12:36.475 --> 01:12:38.800
You remember the
posters in the war?

1214
01:12:38.825 --> 01:12:41.628
Rabies. It makes you afraid
of water. Send him a drone.

1215
01:12:41.653 --> 01:12:43.690
- That'll scare him.
- Yes.

1216
01:12:43.724 --> 01:12:45.592
Away from her.

1217
01:12:45.617 --> 01:12:46.885
Jessup is done.

1218
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:49.779
Lyssie, you're the only one
that can get it right to him.

1219
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.273
<i>Ms. Vickers going for
her communipad early.</i>

1220
01:12:54.298 --> 01:12:55.566
Thank you.

1221
01:12:55.591 --> 01:12:57.193
Sending a drone.

1222
01:12:57.218 --> 01:12:58.353
Nothing to be proud of.

1223
01:12:58.378 --> 01:13:00.848
Please, please, please!

1224
01:13:01.107 --> 01:13:03.034
What's wrong with me?

1225
01:13:03.059 --> 01:13:04.902
What did you do to me?

1226
01:13:09.943 --> 01:13:12.613
Oh!

1227
01:13:17.516 --> 01:13:18.884
Jessup?

1228
01:13:31.364 --> 01:13:33.298
I'm not going anywhere.

1229
01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.440
Okay?

1230
01:13:37.779 --> 01:13:40.349
You watched over me, now
I'm watching over you.

1231
01:13:40.779 --> 01:13:44.150
Sleep now, Jessup, sleep.

1232
01:13:52.459 --> 01:13:53.794
Okay.

1233
01:14:08.407 --> 01:14:10.509
Here we go.

1234
01:14:12.928 --> 01:14:14.663
Oh, no!

1235
01:14:16.198 --> 01:14:18.334
Lucy Gray.

1236
01:14:18.359 --> 01:14:20.093
You stay right there.

1237
01:14:23.671 --> 01:14:24.706
Oh, look at this.

1238
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:27.321
The Pack doing what they
do best. Packing it in.

1239
01:14:27.346 --> 01:14:29.314
Lucy Gray is swarmed, cornered.

1240
01:14:29.339 --> 01:14:32.042
Mizzen, propellering his net.

1241
01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.603
Mr. Snow going for
his communipad.

1242
01:14:40.929 --> 01:14:43.298
Hey, Coral, do you mind
if I take this one?

1243
01:14:43.582 --> 01:14:44.855
Not a chance.

1244
01:15:03.463 --> 01:15:04.897
These drones are not very good.

1245
01:15:04.922 --> 01:15:07.058
Hey! You can't
attack the tributes.

1246
01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:08.451
I'm just sending water.

1247
01:15:20.024 --> 01:15:23.327
You idiots.

1248
01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:27.431
- How did you possibly let her get away?
- I couldn't see a thing.

1249
01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.729
Get this water into
a pile, lumberjack.

1250
01:15:31.754 --> 01:15:35.624
And then when you're done,
you two can watch that beam

1251
01:15:35.649 --> 01:15:38.718
while we get your little friend
from back home up there at least.

1252
01:15:47.954 --> 01:15:48.955
Now.

1253
01:16:08.217 --> 01:16:09.552
Do it now.

1254
01:17:27.787 --> 01:17:30.191
Again, a fall...

1255
01:17:30.216 --> 01:17:33.819
ending a tribute's game.

1256
01:17:35.253 --> 01:17:36.486
Wake up.

1257
01:17:37.805 --> 01:17:40.162
Lucy Gray on the move.

1258
01:17:40.187 --> 01:17:42.223
And so is Pup Harrington.
Thank you, Pup.

1259
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:09.878
You're useless.

1260
01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:17.118
Now, I wish we had a
camera inside of the duct,

1261
01:18:17.143 --> 01:18:18.512
but we don't.

1262
01:18:18.537 --> 01:18:21.362
But we will next year.

1263
01:18:26.051 --> 01:18:27.052
Hey.

1264
01:18:29.139 --> 01:18:31.508
You really think you deserve
that water now, Tanner?

1265
01:18:36.104 --> 01:18:40.708
Look, you just said
watch the beam.

1266
01:18:53.108 --> 01:18:54.209
Coral.

1267
01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:55.799
It's Wovey.

1268
01:18:56.829 --> 01:18:58.263
The little one from 8.

1269
01:18:58.854 --> 01:19:00.188
This should be easy.

1270
01:19:06.678 --> 01:19:08.546
Seven tributes remain.

1271
01:19:08.571 --> 01:19:10.740
Merciless Mizzen, Cunning Coral,

1272
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:12.884
Treacherous Treech,
Dill, Reaper, of course,

1273
01:19:12.909 --> 01:19:16.878
and the lone wolves,
little Wovey and Lucy Gray.

1274
01:19:27.668 --> 01:19:29.284
And who do we have here?

1275
01:19:29.718 --> 01:19:31.787
Ah! It's ill Dill.

1276
01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:33.702
Tuberculosis on legs.

1277
01:20:05.807 --> 01:20:06.808
Dill?

1278
01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:09.389
Dill?

1279
01:20:10.829 --> 01:20:11.898
Dill, wake up.

1280
01:20:14.733 --> 01:20:15.734
Dill.

1281
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:17.314
No.

1282
01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:19.415
What happened?

1283
01:20:20.776 --> 01:20:21.811
Dill?

1284
01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:23.384
Dill?

1285
01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:25.253
Hey.

1286
01:20:25.731 --> 01:20:27.598
Dill, hey, wake up.

1287
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:29.172
Dill.

1288
01:20:29.862 --> 01:20:30.863
Dill!

1289
01:20:36.857 --> 01:20:38.559
I'm so sorry.

1290
01:21:43.227 --> 01:21:44.962
He just tore down the flag.

1291
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:11.865
<i>Are you gonna punish me now?</i>

1292
01:22:16.523 --> 01:22:18.226
<i>Are you going to punish me n...</i>

1293
01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:21.592
<i>Capitol citizens,</i>

1294
01:22:21.851 --> 01:22:24.321
<i>I'm afraid I must
interrupt our Games</i>

1295
01:22:24.346 --> 01:22:26.447
<i>to announce a tragic loss,</i>

1296
01:22:26.472 --> 01:22:28.674
<i>one that affects us all.</i>

1297
01:22:28.699 --> 01:22:33.207
<i>Felix Ravinstill, son of
our beloved president...</i>

1298
01:22:33.232 --> 01:22:34.737
<i>Has, this morning,</i>

1299
01:22:34.762 --> 01:22:36.198
<i>succumbed to his injuries</i>

1300
01:22:36.223 --> 01:22:39.160
<i>sustained in the rebel bombing.</i>

1301
01:22:39.185 --> 01:22:41.820
<i>Out there in the districts,</i>

1302
01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:44.831
<i>they will be celebrating
this young boy's death</i>

1303
01:22:44.856 --> 01:22:46.390
<i>as a triumph.</i>

1304
01:22:46.415 --> 01:22:49.285
<i>I will not allow my Games</i>

1305
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:52.512
<i>to give our enemy
such a victory.</i>

1306
01:22:52.537 --> 01:22:55.241
<i>I swear to you, here and now,</i>

1307
01:22:55.266 --> 01:22:58.602
<i>before the sun
goes down tonight,</i>

1308
01:22:58.631 --> 01:23:02.635
<i>a rainbow of destruction
will engulf our arena.</i>

1309
01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:06.769
<i>Even if it means there's to
be no victor in these Games.</i>

1310
01:23:11.341 --> 01:23:14.210
Get me a drink. Get
me a drink right now.

1311
01:23:35.113 --> 01:23:38.049
I need to see
Dr. Gaul immediately.

1312
01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:47.822
Hey. Go get a
spear. Go up there.

1313
01:23:47.847 --> 01:23:50.650
Push her back as much
as possible. Trust me.

1314
01:23:54.393 --> 01:23:56.328
Come to beg for her life?

1315
01:23:57.756 --> 01:23:58.757
No.

1316
01:23:59.276 --> 01:24:01.446
No, my stitches,

1317
01:24:01.978 --> 01:24:03.644
they broke loose.

1318
01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:06.455
I didn't want the
doctors asking questions.

1319
01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:08.832
Come, sit.

1320
01:24:08.857 --> 01:24:10.226
Pull down your shirt.

1321
01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.829
Shh. Quiet.

1322
01:24:26.933 --> 01:24:29.434
She's up here somewhere.

1323
01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:32.200
This might hurt.

1324
01:24:43.198 --> 01:24:46.235
Jabberjays we call them.

1325
01:24:46.368 --> 01:24:48.245
We sent them out during the war

1326
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:50.138
to pick up rebel conversations,

1327
01:24:50.163 --> 01:24:53.331
squawk it back to
us word for word.

1328
01:24:53.427 --> 01:24:54.428
Watch.

1329
01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.850
A failed experiment,
but an instructive one.

1330
01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:06.980
I'm rounding them up
district by district now

1331
01:25:07.005 --> 01:25:10.474
to see what better
purposes they might serve.

1332
01:25:11.684 --> 01:25:13.352
A failed experiment,

1333
01:25:13.377 --> 01:25:14.946
but an instructive one.

1334
01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:25.118
Here, birdy, birdy, birdy.

1335
01:25:32.543 --> 01:25:33.879
Don't be scared.

1336
01:25:34.151 --> 01:25:35.578
Don't run away.

1337
01:25:37.045 --> 01:25:38.881
Lucy.

1338
01:25:39.109 --> 01:25:42.778
I'll see you in the auditorium
for the finale, Mr. Snow.

1339
01:25:42.803 --> 01:25:45.139
You should be proud of yourself.

1340
01:25:45.164 --> 01:25:49.467
Your songbird, Lucy Gray,
put on a wonderful show.

1341
01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:37.926
Shh. Quiet, quiet. Listen.

1342
01:27:01.679 --> 01:27:02.680
Coral.

1343
01:27:11.519 --> 01:27:12.754
Lucy Gray, is she okay?

1344
01:27:12.779 --> 01:27:14.280
She won't be for long.

1345
01:27:17.243 --> 01:27:18.778
I've got you now, songbird.

1346
01:27:19.521 --> 01:27:20.355
Wait.

1347
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:22.132
What's wrong with Treech?

1348
01:27:28.884 --> 01:27:31.454
Did Coral do
something to Treech?

1349
01:27:39.145 --> 01:27:40.413
Run. Run.

1350
01:27:40.438 --> 01:27:41.739
What did she do to him?

1351
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:47.020
Dissension in the
ranks. Treech is down.

1352
01:27:47.045 --> 01:27:48.714
Good afternoon, Ms. Sickle.

1353
01:28:32.829 --> 01:28:35.263
That is not gonna be good.

1354
01:28:37.134 --> 01:28:38.936
Work, please.

1355
01:28:43.803 --> 01:28:46.039
Wouldn't it be fun
if it was candy?

1356
01:28:50.537 --> 01:28:52.673
Is it over?

1357
01:28:52.731 --> 01:28:55.734
- Can we go home now?
- Wovey.

1358
01:28:55.867 --> 01:28:57.702
- Wovey.
- Please!

1359
01:28:58.274 --> 01:28:59.974
Wovey.

1360
01:29:00.571 --> 01:29:01.805
Wovey.

1361
01:29:05.738 --> 01:29:08.259
Not candy! Down goes Wovey.

1362
01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.656
Help!

1363
01:29:22.346 --> 01:29:23.386
Mizzen,

1364
01:29:23.411 --> 01:29:24.673
- say goodbye!
- Yes!

1365
01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.237
Lucy Gray, wait!

1366
01:29:42.316 --> 01:29:43.885
<i>Lucy, I'm begging you!</i>

1367
01:29:46.004 --> 01:29:47.005
It's not fair.

1368
01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:49.011
It's not.

1369
01:29:49.036 --> 01:29:51.306
I can't have killed
them all for nothing.

1370
01:30:00.129 --> 01:30:01.765
And that is good-bye

1371
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:02.891
to Festus Creed.

1372
01:30:02.916 --> 01:30:04.451
Have a nice summer.

1373
01:30:04.812 --> 01:30:09.183
Now, all colors lead to Gray.

1374
01:30:14.458 --> 01:30:16.060
She's... She's won.

1375
01:30:16.955 --> 01:30:18.857
It's over, she's won.

1376
01:30:18.882 --> 01:30:20.357
She's won, let her out.

1377
01:30:20.382 --> 01:30:22.328
Afraid that's not your
call to make, Mr. Snow.

1378

Get her out.

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:05.178
Get her out! Get her
out! Get her out!

1422
01:33:05.203 --> 01:33:09.175
Who will watch the Games
if there's no victor?

1423
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:12.270
Get her out! Get her out!

1424
01:33:16.949 --> 01:33:18.050
Get her out.

1425
01:33:19.708 --> 01:33:21.943
She's won! Lucy Gray!

1426
01:33:21.968 --> 01:33:26.273
Coriolanus Snow is the winner
of the 10th Annual Hunger Games.

1427
01:33:27.657 --> 01:33:30.060
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1428
01:33:30.085 --> 01:33:31.353
Congrats!

1429
01:33:31.411 --> 01:33:32.279
Congrats!

1430
01:33:32.305 --> 01:33:34.407
Whoo!

1431
01:33:34.432 --> 01:33:35.687
The Games...

1432
01:33:35.712 --> 01:33:37.914
that I had...

1433
01:33:38.356 --> 01:33:40.445
predicted! Whoo!

1434
01:33:41.191 --> 01:33:43.327
- Yeah! Give it up!
- Tigris.

1435
01:33:43.359 --> 01:33:45.494
Snow! Snow! Snow!

1436
01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:47.521
Snow! Snow! Snow!

1437
01:33:47.546 --> 01:33:48.948
Snow! Snow! Snow!

1438
01:33:57.854 --> 01:33:58.889
<i>Lucy Gray?</i>

1439
01:34:05.158 --> 01:34:06.459
Lucy Gray?

1440
01:34:20.702 --> 01:34:23.705
I warned you, Mr. Snow.

1441
01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:25.832
Cheating will be punished.

1442
01:34:26.812 --> 01:34:29.315
More poetically than
even I could have hoped.

1443
01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.907
Lucy Gray, where is she?

1444
01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:32.268
I would be more concerned

1445
01:34:32.293 --> 01:34:35.330
with your own survival
if I were you.

1446
01:34:35.355 --> 01:34:38.592
It's fitting that
both your parents

1447
01:34:38.617 --> 01:34:41.053
could be here for
your big moment.

1448
01:34:41.644 --> 01:34:42.879
That compact.

1449
01:34:43.084 --> 01:34:44.552
How many times did I see

1450
01:34:44.577 --> 01:34:47.080
your mother use it, I wonder...

1451
01:34:47.105 --> 01:34:49.808
to powder her beautiful face?

1452
01:34:50.519 --> 01:34:51.652
Come now,

1453
01:34:51.677 --> 01:34:53.546
we both know that child from 11

1454
01:34:53.571 --> 01:34:55.740
didn't die of disease.

1455
01:34:55.765 --> 01:34:57.859
Or that lumberjack from 7.

1456
01:34:57.884 --> 01:34:59.786
And that old handkerchief,

1457
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:03.614
we found it in the snake
tank, appropriately...

1458
01:35:03.766 --> 01:35:06.902
condemning you with your
father's own initials.

1459
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.240
Your family won't ever see

1460
01:35:09.265 --> 01:35:12.802
that prize money now of course.

1461
01:35:12.954 --> 01:35:15.857
President Ravinstill has left
your form of punishment to me,

1462
01:35:15.882 --> 01:35:17.984
and I've decided
banishment to the districts

1463
01:35:18.009 --> 01:35:22.714
where you'll serve your Capitol
in exile for the next 20 years

1464
01:35:22.739 --> 01:35:25.441
as an anonymous,
peacekeeping grunt.

1465
01:35:31.578 --> 01:35:33.380
Do you hear that, boy?

1466
01:35:35.615 --> 01:35:36.750
Finally.

1467
01:35:38.182 --> 01:35:42.486
The sound of snow falling.

1468
01:36:03.881 --> 01:36:05.148
8.

1469
01:36:05.679 --> 01:36:07.581
Send me to 12.

1470
01:36:13.321 --> 01:36:14.756
Please.

1471
01:36:29.131 --> 01:36:30.776
You know, I thought
I might find you here

1472
01:36:30.801 --> 01:36:32.426
sitting all by yourself.

1473
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.018
Sejanus, what are you
doing... What do you think?

1474
01:36:36.043 --> 01:36:38.345
After what I did in the arena,

1475
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:40.487
my father had to buy the
Academy a brand-new gym

1476
01:36:40.512 --> 01:36:42.349
just so I could get my diploma.

1477
01:36:42.374 --> 01:36:43.675
He begged me to stay.

1478
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:47.057
But once I found out where
they were sending you,

1479
01:36:47.082 --> 01:36:49.650
I couldn't get
out fast enough.

1480
01:36:49.793 --> 01:36:52.297
Barely made the train
because of this stupid knee.

1481
01:36:52.322 --> 01:36:54.424
But it's okay.

1482
01:36:54.449 --> 01:36:56.451
They gave me some
morphling for the pain.

1483
01:36:56.665 --> 01:36:58.533
You volunteered for this?

1484
01:36:58.558 --> 01:37:00.827
I figure I get through basic

1485
01:37:00.852 --> 01:37:03.222
and then maybe I become a medic.

1486
01:37:03.247 --> 01:37:04.948
Make a real difference out here.

1487
01:37:04.973 --> 01:37:06.607
Just like you said.

1488
01:37:07.559 --> 01:37:10.129
They never told us what you did.

1489
01:37:10.154 --> 01:37:11.488
I cheated.

1490
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:14.432
To save Lucy Gray
from the snakes.

1491
01:37:16.925 --> 01:37:18.293
Do you think they killed her?

1492
01:37:18.318 --> 01:37:20.121
Why would they risk it?

1493
01:37:20.148 --> 01:37:21.688
She was a big hit.

1494
01:37:21.713 --> 01:37:23.026
If there is a Games next year,

1495
01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:24.245
they're probably
gonna invite her

1496
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:25.791
to sing at the opening ceremony.

1497
01:37:27.325 --> 01:37:28.592
You know, when you came in,

1498
01:37:28.617 --> 01:37:30.586
I was weighing the
merits of suicide.

1499
01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:33.514
When we're about to be free?

1500
01:37:33.539 --> 01:37:35.942
When the girl you
risked everything for

1501
01:37:36.022 --> 01:37:38.958
might be waiting for you
at the end of this track?

1502
01:37:38.983 --> 01:37:42.053
My friend, don't give
them the satisfaction.

1503
01:37:42.078 --> 01:37:43.445
Your life has just begun.

1504
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:45.005
You're gonna do great.

1505
01:37:47.406 --> 01:37:48.808
We're both gonna do great.

1506
01:37:49.278 --> 01:37:50.848
Just be careful.

1507
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:52.384
Okay?

1508
01:37:55.972 --> 01:37:57.773
It's a different world out here.

1509
01:38:18.628 --> 01:38:19.662
Move it out!

1510
01:38:24.730 --> 01:38:26.671
<i>Welcome to 12.</i>

1511
01:38:26.696 --> 01:38:28.832
<i>We're proud to have
every one of you</i>

1512
01:38:28.857 --> 01:38:31.151
<i>serving your country out here.</i>

1513
01:38:31.176 --> 01:38:32.610
<i>For the next 20 years,</i>

1514
01:38:32.635 --> 01:38:34.768
<i>brothers and sisters
in your immediate squad</i>

1515
01:38:34.793 --> 01:38:36.034
<i>will become your family.</i>

1516
01:38:36.373 --> 01:38:39.310
You will train together,
sleep together, eat together.

1517
01:38:39.335 --> 01:38:42.948
You will rise together and
you will fall together.

1518
01:38:42.973 --> 01:38:44.507
You will be our eyes and ears

1519
01:38:44.532 --> 01:38:47.135
out here on my base
as well as off it.

1520
01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:48.926
And it will be your duty

1521
01:38:48.951 --> 01:38:50.916
to report anything
suspicious you see,

1522
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:52.442
because if you do not,

1523
01:38:52.467 --> 01:38:55.536
you are as good as
a rebel yourself.

1524
01:38:56.586 --> 01:38:59.643
Last month, a Peacekeeper
and two mine bosses

1525
01:38:59.668 --> 01:39:02.336
were shot dead in the pits.

1526
01:39:02.805 --> 01:39:04.975
We retrieved the murder weapon.

1527
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.533
We swabbed it for DNA.

1528
01:39:06.558 --> 01:39:09.928
And the results proved
beyond doubt that this man,

1529
01:39:09.953 --> 01:39:11.921
Arlo Chance...

1530
01:39:12.473 --> 01:39:13.641
is guilty.

1531
01:39:13.666 --> 01:39:15.668
So, watch, all of you.

1532
01:39:15.796 --> 01:39:17.431
This is what happens

1533
01:39:17.597 --> 01:39:19.933
when you challenge the
Capitol's rule of law.

1534
01:39:19.958 --> 01:39:21.336
- He's innocent!
- No, no, no!

1535
01:39:21.399 --> 01:39:23.200
No, no, no!

1536
01:39:23.225 --> 01:39:24.692
- He's innocent!
- Lil, Lil, Lil!

1537
01:39:24.717 --> 01:39:26.020
- No, Lil!
- He's innocent!

1538
01:39:26.045 --> 01:39:27.879
Run, Lil, run!

1539
01:39:29.777 --> 01:39:32.143
Run, Lil! Run, Lil!

1540
01:39:32.168 --> 01:39:33.403
- No, no, no!
- Arlo!

1541
01:39:33.428 --> 01:39:35.530
- No! No!
- No, no, no!

1542
01:39:35.555 --> 01:39:37.457
- No! Arlo!
- No, no, no!

1543
01:39:38.557 --> 01:39:40.768
Run, Lil! You're murderers!

1544
01:39:40.793 --> 01:39:42.729
No! No!

1545
01:39:42.754 --> 01:39:45.198
Run, Lil, run!
You're murderers!

1546
01:39:45.223 --> 01:39:46.826
Run, Lil, run!

1547
01:39:46.851 --> 01:39:48.452
Run, Lil, run!

1548
01:39:49.593 --> 01:39:52.128
He didn't do it!

1549
01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:54.990
You're all murderers!
Let me out!

1550
01:39:55.015 --> 01:39:56.684
Let me out!

1551
01:39:57.472 --> 01:39:59.240
Let me out!

1552
01:39:59.701 --> 01:40:00.702
Arlo!

1553
01:40:00.815 --> 01:40:02.382
What were you
thinking back there?

1554
01:40:02.407 --> 01:40:04.543
She didn't do anything,
Coryo. What is she guilty of?

1555
01:40:04.568 --> 01:40:07.404
Being directly
associated with rebels.

1556
01:40:07.532 --> 01:40:08.667
What more do they need?

1557
01:40:08.692 --> 01:40:10.604
If she had gotten
through the crowd...

1558
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:13.066
He didn't do it! I
swear he didn't do it!

1559
01:40:13.091 --> 01:40:15.928
I don't think I would have
been able to shoot her.

1560
01:40:15.953 --> 01:40:16.987
Would you?

1561
01:40:17.012 --> 01:40:18.042
He didn't do anything!

1562
01:40:18.067 --> 01:40:20.690
You need to find a way to make
peace with our life here now.

1563
01:40:20.735 --> 01:40:24.905
Or have your father buy you a
discharge and do something else.

1564
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:26.263
Hey.

1565
01:40:26.288 --> 01:40:28.806
Hoff's given us all leave
passes for the weekend.

1566
01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:30.032
Boost morale.

1567
01:40:31.017 --> 01:40:32.284
Boost morale.

1568
01:40:33.604 --> 01:40:35.107
Please.

1569
01:40:35.985 --> 01:40:38.456
Please help.

1570
01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:58.186
Hey, uh, I'm gonna
go get a drink.

1571
01:41:09.021 --> 01:41:10.956
Is it hot in here?

1572
01:41:10.981 --> 01:41:12.314
Yeah!

1573
01:41:12.592 --> 01:41:15.863
'Cause we're plannin' on
heating it up a set more.

1574
01:41:17.681 --> 01:41:20.721
The one, the only,
Lucy Gray Baird!

1575
01:41:30.521 --> 01:41:32.724
Well, hey there, District
12, did you miss me?

1576
01:41:33.032 --> 01:41:34.565
Yeah!

1577
01:41:34.599 --> 01:41:36.510
I bet you never expected
to lay eyes on me again.

1578
01:41:36.535 --> 01:41:37.878
And, let me tell you,
that goes both ways.

1579
01:41:37.903 --> 01:41:39.038
But I am back.

1580
01:41:39.063 --> 01:41:41.264
I sure am back!

1581
01:41:41.575 --> 01:41:43.111
Oh! Is that bottle there for me?

1582
01:41:43.136 --> 01:41:44.260
Oh, come on, y'all.

1583
01:41:44.285 --> 01:41:46.073
You know, I gave up
drinking when I was 12.

1584
01:41:48.673 --> 01:41:51.143
It's to clear my pipes,
y'all. To clear my pipes.

1585
01:41:51.168 --> 01:41:52.736
Now, how about a song, huh?

1586
01:41:52.761 --> 01:41:54.196
Yeah!

1587
01:41:57.716 --> 01:42:00.852
<i>♪ Can't take my past</i>

1588
01:42:02.078 --> 01:42:06.190
<i>♪ Can't take my history</i>

1589
01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:09.323
<i>♪ You could take my pa</i>

1590
01:42:09.348 --> 01:42:13.452
<i>♪ But his name's a mystery</i>

1591
01:42:13.477 --> 01:42:14.713
Yeah!

1592
01:42:14.837 --> 01:42:18.573
<i>♪ Nothing you
could take from me</i>

1593
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:21.940
<i>♪ Was ever worth keepin'</i>

1594
01:42:22.643 --> 01:42:29.253
<i>♪ Oh, nothing you can take</i>

1595
01:42:30.291 --> 01:42:34.479
<i>♪ Was ever worth keepin'</i>

1596

1608

Lucy Gray!

1609
01:43:20.882 --> 01:43:22.484
- Lucy Gray!
- Billy Taupe!

1610
01:43:23.565 --> 01:43:25.308
You're sounding kind
of thin, Lucy Gray.

1611
01:43:25.333 --> 01:43:26.435
Billy! Billy!

1612
01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:29.196
You're all sounding
thin without me. No?

1613
01:43:29.221 --> 01:43:30.456
- Billy!
- I've got it.

1614
01:43:30.885 --> 01:43:32.325
Billy!

1615
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:35.312
Billy!

1616
01:43:35.768 --> 01:43:38.637
You swore you wouldn't play
with them again, Billy Taupe.

1617
01:43:41.082 --> 01:43:42.116
Come on.

1618
01:43:42.141 --> 01:43:43.910
Settle down, settle down.

1619
01:43:48.301 --> 01:43:49.536
I know you miss me, Lucy Gray.

1620
01:43:49.608 --> 01:43:50.976
Get your hands off me right now.

1621
01:43:51.001 --> 01:43:52.202
Get your hands off me, Billy.

1622
01:43:52.227 --> 01:43:53.337
Get your hands off
me, Billy Taupe.

1623
01:43:53.370 --> 01:43:54.471
After what you did to me,

1624
01:43:54.537 --> 01:43:55.782
you get your hands
off me right now.

1625
01:43:55.807 --> 01:43:57.350
Or I swear I will take
a snake and I will...

1626
01:43:57.438 --> 01:43:58.674
Don't touch her!

1627
01:44:01.454 --> 01:44:02.488
Coryo, stop!

1628
01:44:02.513 --> 01:44:04.659
- Get off me, get off me!
- What are you, crazy?

1629
01:44:04.684 --> 01:44:06.119
Come on. We gotta
get out of here.

1630
01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:19.754
Who'd have thought
I'd have to save you?

1631
01:44:25.118 --> 01:44:26.452
She's here.

1632
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:28.000
She's alive.

1633
01:44:30.077 --> 01:44:32.146
<i>♪ Are you</i>

1634
01:44:32.514 --> 01:44:34.266

1642
01:45:14.281 --> 01:45:16.083
They said I might
find you out here.

1643
01:45:18.794 --> 01:45:19.795
Sorry, I...

1644
01:45:23.287 --> 01:45:25.438
I still got one
foot in the arena.

1645
01:45:31.371 --> 01:45:32.578
Your hair,

1646
01:45:33.355 --> 01:45:34.657
that uniform...

1647
01:45:34.682 --> 01:45:36.416
I thought you were dead.

1648
01:45:36.441 --> 01:45:38.144
Yeah, I thought I was too.

1649
01:45:39.885 --> 01:45:44.056
But your dean, Highbottom,
he had them send me home.

1650
01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:45.772
Highbottom did?

1651
01:45:45.797 --> 01:45:48.198
Put me on a train himself,
gave me some money.

1652
01:45:48.366 --> 01:45:50.235
He said they'd sent you to 8.

1653
01:45:50.448 --> 01:45:51.984
For breaking their rules.

1654
01:45:53.454 --> 01:45:54.654
Saving your life.

1655
01:45:54.878 --> 01:45:56.212
But I gave them my last cent

1656
01:45:56.237 --> 01:45:58.267
so that I could come here to 12.

1657
01:45:59.799 --> 01:46:01.454
Because I had to
try to find you.

1658
01:46:01.859 --> 01:46:03.761
Your dean, he...

1659
01:46:04.704 --> 01:46:06.948
he told me the
strangest thing. He...

1660
01:46:10.034 --> 01:46:12.884
He said he was glad
that I survived you.

1661
01:46:13.914 --> 01:46:16.516
He told you what I did
to that boy in the arena?

1662
01:46:21.168 --> 01:46:22.775
I didn't have a choice.

1663
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.735
- That little girl, Dill...
- I know.

1664
01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.118
I thought it'd be
one of the others...

1665
01:46:26.143 --> 01:46:28.178
- maybe Coral...
- Hey.

1666
01:46:28.203 --> 01:46:29.871
You are not a killer, Lucy Gray.

1667
01:46:29.896 --> 01:46:31.031
Yes, I am.

1668
01:46:33.907 --> 01:46:35.376
Both of us are now.

1669
01:46:37.469 --> 01:46:38.470
You're safe.

1670
01:46:59.539 --> 01:47:01.141
Your Peacekeeper friends.

1671
01:47:01.753 --> 01:47:02.787
I'll handle this.

1672
01:47:02.812 --> 01:47:04.748
They'll be here about
the fight last night.

1673
01:47:06.797 --> 01:47:08.565
Hey, they can't see us together.

1674
01:47:10.283 --> 01:47:12.051
There's a lake out in the woods.

1675
01:47:14.268 --> 01:47:16.637
Nobody knows much of
it except us Covey.

1676
01:47:18.230 --> 01:47:19.598
Meet me here tomorrow, we'll go.

1677
01:47:20.391 --> 01:47:22.760
We can be free out there.

1678
01:47:22.785 --> 01:47:24.351
Maude Ivory, you got my guitar?

1679
01:47:24.376 --> 01:47:25.945
- Yeah.
- Thanks, honey.

1680
01:47:32.897 --> 01:47:34.210
I can put something together.

1681
01:47:34.235 --> 01:47:35.819
- All right.
- Yeah.

1682
01:47:36.375 --> 01:47:37.810
Your boy is coming.

1683
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:39.626
See you later.

1684
01:47:41.355 --> 01:47:43.091
Hey, you're back.

1685
01:47:43.909 --> 01:47:45.335
How's Lucy Gray?

1686
01:47:46.339 --> 01:47:50.179
Figured you'd be a while, so
I decided to explore town.

1687
01:47:50.663 --> 01:47:51.702
Oh.

1688
01:47:51.864 --> 01:47:53.532
With Billy Taupe?

1689
01:47:53.691 --> 01:47:55.726
And who's the
other guy with him?

1690
01:47:55.955 --> 01:47:58.223
I remember that
from the Academy.

1691
01:47:58.248 --> 01:47:59.916
Watching you watch everyone.

1692
01:48:00.812 --> 01:48:02.915
Carefully choosing
when to weigh in.

1693
01:48:02.957 --> 01:48:04.358
Are you trying to
help these people?

1694
01:48:04.383 --> 01:48:06.385
Don't you think they need help?

1695
01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:07.879
They lost the war, Sejanus.

1696
01:48:07.904 --> 01:48:11.807
A war they started that
made your family rich.

1697
01:48:12.631 --> 01:48:14.400
I am not about to throw away

1698
01:48:14.425 --> 01:48:16.661
any chance I might have
of getting home someday

1699
01:48:16.686 --> 01:48:18.621
just because you
feel a bit guilty.

1700
01:48:20.230 --> 01:48:21.890

Mockingjays, we call 'em.

1721
01:49:50.013 --> 01:49:51.614
Does she survive?

1722
01:49:52.702 --> 01:49:56.038
Lucy Gray, in the
song? The footprints?

1723
01:49:56.063 --> 01:49:57.764
Maybe she flew away.

1724
01:49:57.789 --> 01:50:00.091
I'm sure she's out
there somewhere.

1725
01:50:00.116 --> 01:50:01.718
She's a survivor.

1726
01:50:02.183 --> 01:50:04.352
But it's a mystery, sweetheart.

1727
01:50:04.715 --> 01:50:07.007
Just like me.

1728
01:50:07.032 --> 01:50:08.465
I brought you something.

1729
01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.702
It was my mother's.

1730
01:50:18.271 --> 01:50:19.773
I'd like for you to have it.

1731
01:50:22.464 --> 01:50:23.932
Mmm.

1732
01:50:23.957 --> 01:50:26.192
It still smells like roses.

1733
01:50:28.123 --> 01:50:29.324
Thank you.

1734
01:50:30.168 --> 01:50:31.827
I'll take good care
of it, I promise.

1735
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.703
You must miss your
family so much out here.

1736
01:50:36.302 --> 01:50:37.535
I do.

1737
01:50:38.444 --> 01:50:39.588
I worry about them all the time.

1738
01:50:39.776 --> 01:50:41.978
Would you really
go back, though?

1739
01:50:42.475 --> 01:50:44.343
If you could?

1740
01:50:44.486 --> 01:50:45.587
To the Capitol?

1741
01:50:45.612 --> 01:50:46.847
I have to.

1742
01:50:47.264 --> 01:50:48.666
It's where I belong.

1743
01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:52.514
But I hope you'll
come back with me.

1744
01:50:52.539 --> 01:50:54.475
Capitol's not for me.

1745
01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:57.399
At least it's
civilized. Has order.

1746
01:50:57.424 --> 01:50:59.459
The Hunger Games are order?

1747
01:51:00.131 --> 01:51:01.564
No.

1748
01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:02.894
No, of course not.

1749
01:51:04.339 --> 01:51:07.210
What if this was our
life, Coriolanus?

1750
01:51:07.563 --> 01:51:08.863
Out here.

1751
01:51:09.968 --> 01:51:12.237
Waking up whenever.

1752
01:51:12.372 --> 01:51:14.708
Catching our own food,
living out by a lake.

1753
01:51:14.733 --> 01:51:18.003
I mean, would you still feel a
need for the Capitol even then?

1754
01:51:18.028 --> 01:51:19.095
Uh...

1755
01:51:20.802 --> 01:51:23.194
- Did you two just pick this?
- Yep.

1756
01:51:23.219 --> 01:51:24.453
Thank you.

1757
01:51:27.502 --> 01:51:29.499
Well, it's a little
early yet, Maude Ivory.

1758
01:51:30.044 --> 01:51:31.944
- No.
- No.

1759
01:51:32.214 --> 01:51:33.515
Early for what?

1760
01:51:34.191 --> 01:51:35.625
To eat the roots.

1761
01:51:36.953 --> 01:51:39.655
Pretty little thing,
but it's determined.

1762
01:51:39.686 --> 01:51:41.622
Some people call
it "swamp potato."

1763
01:51:41.647 --> 01:51:45.417
But I think "katniss" has a
much nicer ring, don't you?

1764
01:51:49.752 --> 01:51:51.620
Hey, grab the rods, CC?

1765
01:51:51.872 --> 01:51:53.708
We could use some
more fish at home.

1766
01:51:58.112 --> 01:51:59.714
He misses Billy Taupe.

1767
01:52:01.477 --> 01:52:02.545
Do you?

1768
01:52:04.986 --> 01:52:06.855
Not since the Reaping, no.

1769
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:10.918
I can't trust him anymore.

1770
01:52:11.997 --> 01:52:13.598
Trust is everything.

1771
01:52:14.721 --> 01:52:16.322
It's everything to me.

1772
01:52:18.587 --> 01:52:20.389
More important even than love.

1773
01:52:21.385 --> 01:52:23.754
Without trust, you might
as well be dead to me.

1774
01:52:25.287 --> 01:52:27.289
You can trust me.
I promise you that.

1775
01:52:27.314 --> 01:52:29.091
If you can trust
anyone in this world,

1776
01:52:29.116 --> 01:52:30.509
you can trust me.

1777
01:52:34.273 --> 01:52:35.806
You can trust me too.

1778
01:52:41.074 --> 01:52:42.075
Private Snow?

1779
01:52:42.955 --> 01:52:43.956
Come with us.

1780
01:52:55.408 --> 01:52:56.877
Snow.

1781
01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:58.437
I received the results

1782
01:52:58.462 --> 01:53:00.831
from your aptitude
tests this morning.

1783
01:53:01.036 --> 01:53:02.895
Looked over your
training records too.

1784
01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.588
Your performance is exemplary.

1785
01:53:04.613 --> 01:53:06.778
Well, half the other
recruits can't read, sir.

1786
01:53:06.803 --> 01:53:11.207
You're General
Crassus Snow's boy.

1787
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:14.567
What did you do to end up here?

1788
01:53:14.904 --> 01:53:16.873
I made an enemy, sir.

1789
01:53:17.383 --> 01:53:18.750
In the Capitol.

1790
01:53:18.775 --> 01:53:22.036
I've made a career out of
ruining my enemies' plans.

1791
01:53:22.608 --> 01:53:23.872
I'm gonna reassign you

1792
01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:25.723
to officer training
in District 2.

1793
01:53:25.748 --> 01:53:27.809
You'll earn a real wage.

1794
01:53:27.918 --> 01:53:30.669
Maybe even have another
shot at the Capitol one day.

1795
01:53:30.694 --> 01:53:32.930
Train leaves in 10 days.

1796
01:53:33.054 --> 01:53:34.921
Keep a clean record,

1797
01:53:34.946 --> 01:53:38.482
you'll never see anyone
from District 12 again.

1798
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.981
Is there a problem?

1799
01:53:44.006 --> 01:53:46.614
This is an honor,
Private. Not an option.

1800
01:53:47.127 --> 01:53:48.329
Yes, sir.

1801
01:53:49.582 --> 01:53:50.583
Thank you.

1802
01:53:53.225 --> 01:53:55.326
<i>- Coryo?</i>
- Tigris?

1803
01:53:57.294 --> 01:53:58.329
<i>Coryo!</i>

1804
01:53:58.354 --> 01:54:00.567
Tigris.

1805
01:54:01.170 --> 01:54:02.370
<i>Your curls!</i>

1806
01:54:02.395 --> 01:54:04.664
Yeah, I know.

1807
01:54:06.175 --> 01:54:07.375
Where are you?

1808
01:54:07.763 --> 01:54:08.797
<i>Coryo, we're fine.</i>

1809
01:54:08.822 --> 01:54:10.590
Tigris, where are you?

1810
01:54:14.208 --> 01:54:16.378
<i>We had to move out.</i>

1811
01:54:16.453 --> 01:54:18.923
<i>We're renting this place
just for right now.</i>

1812
01:54:18.948 --> 01:54:20.083
They evicted you?

1813
01:54:20.297 --> 01:54:22.866
<i>Listen. I'm fine.</i>

1814
01:54:22.891 --> 01:54:24.011
<i>Grandma'am is fine.</i>

1815
01:54:24.036 --> 01:54:27.441
<i>I really don't want
you to worry, okay?</i>

1816
01:54:27.466 --> 01:54:29.902
I think I found a
way out of here.

1817
01:54:29.965 --> 01:54:32.601
I just have to make it
through Officer Training in 2.

1818
01:54:32.626 --> 01:54:35.529
And then I can make my
way back to the Capitol.

1819
01:54:35.554 --> 01:54:37.590
- I will fix this.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1820
01:54:38.224 --> 01:54:39.525
I'm gonna be home soon.

1821
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:40.805
I promise.

1822
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:42.523
<i>Don't make me hope.</i>

1823
01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:08.287
Secure! Good to go!

1824
01:55:27.305 --> 01:55:30.176
Whatever it is you're
doing, you need to stop it.

1825
01:55:30.201 --> 01:55:31.434
- What are you...
- Don't.

1826
01:55:31.459 --> 01:55:34.295
I saw you talking to
that woman in the jail.

1827
01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.700
If I don't report you now...

1828
01:55:35.725 --> 01:55:37.393
You don't know
anything to report.

1829
01:55:37.418 --> 01:55:39.787
They know we're
friends, Sejanus.

1830
01:55:39.812 --> 01:55:41.318
You're gonna get us both killed.

1831
01:55:41.343 --> 01:55:43.178
You told me I
could do something.

1832
01:55:43.203 --> 01:55:45.907
You told me I could
make a difference.

1833
01:55:48.085 --> 01:55:50.154
There's a group of
locals that are getting

1834
01:55:50.179 --> 01:55:51.889
- out of District 12 for good.
- Don't. Stop talking.

1835
01:55:51.914 --> 01:55:53.849
- I can't hear this.
- Listen to me.

1836
01:55:58.814 --> 01:56:00.481
They're going up north

1837
01:56:00.506 --> 01:56:03.342
to start a new life
far away from Panem.

1838
01:56:04.433 --> 01:56:05.668
They need money for supplies.

1839
01:56:05.693 --> 01:56:07.930
They told me I could go
if I got it for them.

1840
01:56:07.955 --> 01:56:09.089
You could come with us.

1841
01:56:09.114 --> 01:56:11.016
You're giving money
to the locals.

1842
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:13.482
Are you out of your
mind? They're all rebels.

1843
01:56:13.507 --> 01:56:15.225
I can't stay here. I won't.

1844
01:56:15.250 --> 01:56:17.485
They're not planning on doing
anything dangerous, okay?

1845
01:56:17.518 --> 01:56:19.098
It's all dangerous.

1846
01:56:19.123 --> 01:56:22.060
They're just doing what
anybody else would do, Coryo.

1847
01:56:22.085 --> 01:56:24.841
The leader, Spruce, he wants
to get his sister, Lil,

1848
01:56:24.866 --> 01:56:25.968
out of jail on base.

1849
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.204
Hoff is going to execute her

1850
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:29.530
just because she knows
the man that they killed.

1851
01:56:29.564 --> 01:56:30.798
It's wrong.

1852
01:56:30.832 --> 01:56:32.201
I'm gonna help them get her out.

1853
01:56:32.234 --> 01:56:34.535
- It's treason, Sejanus.
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.

1854
01:56:34.569 --> 01:56:36.973
I'm just doing what you
told me to do at the arena.

1855
01:56:36.998 --> 01:56:38.614
I was just trying to save you

1856
01:56:38.639 --> 01:56:40.770
the first time you did
something stupid enough

1857
01:56:40.795 --> 01:56:42.262
to ruin my life.

1858
01:56:43.778 --> 01:56:46.382
What if they catch you
bringing this woman off base?

1859
01:56:46.415 --> 01:56:48.384
It's worth the risk
to do the right thing.

1860
01:56:48.417 --> 01:56:49.434
For you.

1861
01:56:49.459 --> 01:56:51.071
Your father will just
buy your way out of it

1862
01:56:51.096 --> 01:56:52.463
like he always does,

1863
01:56:52.488 --> 01:56:55.358
while I'll be hung
just for knowing you.

1864
01:56:56.701 --> 01:56:57.702
Please.

1865
01:56:58.598 --> 01:57:00.480
Don't make me rescue you again.

1866
01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:03.083
I don't need you to
rescue me, Coryo.

1867
01:57:23.527 --> 01:57:24.997

You said that money was

These are supplies.

1898
01:59:35.645 --> 01:59:36.809
What, did you think
this was a game?

1899
01:59:36.834 --> 01:59:38.244
You said that nobody
was gonna get hurt.

1900
01:59:38.269 --> 01:59:39.345
- That isn't part of the deal.
- Hey.

1901
01:59:40.311 --> 01:59:41.547
Hey, stop!

1902
01:59:42.755 --> 01:59:44.524
What are you doing?
Guns, Sejanus?

1903
01:59:44.549 --> 01:59:47.161
I didn't know there was gonna be
weapons, Coryo. They lied to me.

1904
01:59:47.186 --> 01:59:48.721
You thought they'd be honest?

1905
01:59:48.777 --> 01:59:50.689
Are you crazy? There are
Peacekeepers right out there.

1906
01:59:50.714 --> 01:59:52.552
There's another one
in here now, too.

1907
01:59:52.577 --> 01:59:54.112
Okay, wait.

1908
01:59:54.261 --> 01:59:55.361
And the mayor's daughter?

1909
01:59:55.386 --> 01:59:57.409
Hey, it's okay,
Spruce. He's with me.

1910
01:59:57.434 --> 01:59:59.098
I told him to come in
here. He's gonna help.

1911

- Hey, where'd...
- Wait, wait, wait.

She's okay, Spruce.

1914
02:00:04.092 --> 02:00:05.645
She's joining us
too. She's with me.

1915
02:00:05.670 --> 02:00:06.704
She what?

1916
02:00:06.729 --> 02:00:08.916
Quiet down, Mayfair.
I'll explain later.

1917
02:00:08.941 --> 02:00:12.144
I think I'm done listening
to your explanations.

1918
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:14.028
She's not going anywhere.

1919
02:00:14.053 --> 02:00:15.454
And neither are you.

1920
02:00:15.479 --> 02:00:17.749
My pa's gonna string
y'all up for this.

1921
02:00:17.774 --> 02:00:18.608
Stop!

1922
02:00:18.653 --> 02:00:19.744
She'll tell everyone, you idiot.

1923
02:00:19.769 --> 02:00:21.278
- She'll get us all hung.
- He's right.

1924
02:00:21.303 --> 02:00:23.544
No, she won't, Spruce.
She's all talk, no action.

1925
02:00:23.606 --> 02:00:25.916
What do you think, Lucy Gray?

1926
02:00:25.941 --> 02:00:27.576
Am I all talk, no action?

1927
02:00:27.928 --> 02:00:31.198
Hey, how'd you enjoy
the Capitol, by the way?

1928
02:00:32.318 --> 02:00:33.987
See y'all at the Hanging Tree.

1929
02:00:34.012 --> 02:00:35.216
No, no!

1930
02:00:36.134 --> 02:00:37.419
Wait.

Coriolanus, what
did you just do?

1934
02:00:49.112 --> 02:00:50.980
Well, you just shot the
mayor's daughter, son.

1935
02:00:51.005 --> 02:00:52.223
What did you just do?

1936
02:00:52.248 --> 02:00:54.465
If you weren't a rebel
before, you are now.

1937
02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:56.359
- You killed her.
- Quiet, Billy Taupe.

1938
02:00:56.384 --> 02:00:57.550
You're all right.

1939
02:00:57.576 --> 02:00:58.754
You and me, we're
gonna be all right.

1940
02:00:58.779 --> 02:01:00.114
No one is gonna
think this was us.

1941
02:01:00.139 --> 02:01:02.139
You reckon you're just
gonna walk out of here free?

1942
02:01:03.333 --> 02:01:05.666
- Dump this on me, maybe?
- I said, pipe down.

1943
02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:08.278
You got a surprise
coming, Capitol boy.

1944
02:01:08.303 --> 02:01:11.075
If I'm gonna swing for
this, you swing with me.

1945
02:01:14.292 --> 02:01:16.138
Oh!

1946
02:01:16.163 --> 02:01:18.028
- I didn't trust him anyway.
- Billy Taupe!

1947
02:01:18.053 --> 02:01:21.065
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1948
02:01:21.090 --> 02:01:23.525
You're gonna go back out on that
stage and you're gonna sing.

1949
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:25.120
You're gonna sing
like nothing is wrong.

1950
02:01:25.145 --> 02:01:26.697
And I'm gonna find us a
way out of this, okay?

1951
02:01:26.722 --> 02:01:28.942
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay? I swear. I swear.

1952
02:01:28.967 --> 02:01:30.068
Go. Go.

1953
02:01:31.135 --> 02:01:33.442
Get rid of these guns. Go.

1954
02:01:33.467 --> 02:01:35.232
Go, Spruce, go.

1955
02:01:35.257 --> 02:01:36.568
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1956
02:01:36.593 --> 02:01:37.837
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

1957
02:01:37.862 --> 02:01:39.427
- For once, shut up.
- It's all my fault!

1958
02:01:39.452 --> 02:01:41.078
All of this is your fault.

1959
02:01:41.103 --> 02:01:43.772
It's only gonna get worse if you
don't pull yourself together.

1960
02:01:43.797 --> 02:01:46.233
If you breathe a word now,
both of us, we're finished.

1961
02:01:46.258 --> 02:01:47.626
So we go back out there

1962
02:01:47.651 --> 02:01:49.958
and we act like
nothing is wrong.

1963
02:01:49.983 --> 02:01:51.485
- I don't know...
- Hey.

1964
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:53.848
Hey, look at me.

1965
02:01:53.873 --> 02:01:57.466
You have to pull yourself together.
You have to pull it together.

1966
02:01:57.496 --> 02:01:59.364
You came here for me, right?

1967
02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.508
We're brothers?

1968
02:02:02.031 --> 02:02:03.294
Brothers.

1969
02:02:03.319 --> 02:02:07.924
So whatever you've done, I
swear I will keep you safe.

1970
02:02:08.345 --> 02:02:11.262
Those guns were the only loose
end besides the four of us.

1971
02:02:11.287 --> 02:02:13.114
So we're gonna be okay.

1972
02:02:13.427 --> 02:02:15.429
Okay? Not a word.

1973
02:02:15.454 --> 02:02:16.522
- Okay.
- Okay?

1974
02:02:22.605 --> 02:02:24.239
- Hey, Beanie.
- Yeah?

1975
02:02:24.264 --> 02:02:26.401
Who's that girl you
were dancing with, man?

1976
02:02:26.481 --> 02:02:28.248
I think her name was Josie.

1977
02:02:28.273 --> 02:02:31.110
Come on, everybody,
up! Everybody up!

1978
02:02:31.135 --> 02:02:33.738
- Let's go!
- Smiley, what's going on?

1979
02:02:35.028 --> 02:02:36.563
Hoff is losing his mind.

1980
02:02:36.605 --> 02:02:38.888
The mayor's daughter got
shot, and her boyfriend, too.

1981
02:02:38.913 --> 02:02:40.708
He's sending out
every grunt we've got,

1982
02:02:40.733 --> 02:02:42.520
to find the guns that did it.

1983
02:02:47.104 --> 02:02:50.942
It is our duty to keep
peace in this district.

1984
02:02:50.967 --> 02:02:53.836
So these murderers shall
be brought to justice.

1985
02:02:53.925 --> 02:02:56.160
We shall find their
murder weapons.

1986
02:02:56.185 --> 02:02:59.223
<i>If the killers are
still in Panem's grasp,</i>

1987
02:02:59.248 --> 02:03:01.851
<i>they will hang before
the week is out.</i>

1988
02:03:03.024 --> 02:03:04.960
Right there. Don't
move, all right?

1989
02:03:04.985 --> 02:03:06.196
Check the other one.

1990
02:03:06.221 --> 02:03:07.287
I didn't do anything!

1991
02:03:07.312 --> 02:03:09.153
Go!

1992
02:03:09.178 --> 02:03:10.255
Backs to the wall!

1993
02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:11.683
These are children, please!

1994
02:03:13.841 --> 02:03:15.276
- Clear!
- Clear!

1995
02:03:24.731 --> 02:03:26.069
Are you okay?

1996
02:03:26.094 --> 02:03:28.270
The mayor's going to get
me killed, Coriolanus.

1997
02:03:28.295 --> 02:03:29.596
He already thinks it was me.

1998
02:03:29.621 --> 02:03:31.388
Billy Taupe, Mayfair, both dead.

1999
02:03:31.413 --> 02:03:33.466
If they catch Spruce
now, or Sejanus talks...

2000
02:03:33.491 --> 02:03:36.561
- Sejanus won't talk.
- How do you know that?

2001
02:03:36.586 --> 02:03:38.052
They torture the
people they catch

2002
02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:39.111
for information here.

2003
02:03:39.136 --> 02:03:40.552
Even Peacekeepers.

2004
02:03:40.577 --> 02:03:41.747
I'm sorry.

2005
02:03:42.375 --> 02:03:43.480
I'm so sorry.

2006
02:03:43.505 --> 02:03:45.306
I should have dealt
with those guns myself.

2007
02:03:45.730 --> 02:03:47.932
And Mayfair...

2008
02:03:47.957 --> 02:03:48.966
I just wasn't thinking straight.

2009
02:03:48.991 --> 02:03:51.174
I have to run. North.

2010
02:03:51.199 --> 02:03:53.134
Like Billy Taupe and
the others talked about.

2011
02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:54.560
Away from the districts.

2012
02:03:54.585 --> 02:03:56.163
If I stay here now, I'm
as good as dead, too.

2013
02:03:56.188 --> 02:03:57.489
What about the Covey?

2014
02:03:57.514 --> 02:03:59.382
They can look after each other.

2015
02:04:00.558 --> 02:04:02.560
I just wanted to say goodbye.

2016
02:04:06.866 --> 02:04:08.668
I'll come with you.

2017
02:04:08.819 --> 02:04:10.788
- What about your family?
- Look.

2018
02:04:11.134 --> 02:04:13.797
I just learned Hoff is sending
me to 2 for Officer Training

2019
02:04:13.822 --> 02:04:15.891
- but none of that matters now.
- You were gonna leave.

2020
02:04:15.916 --> 02:04:18.151
It's all Panem.

2021
02:04:18.176 --> 02:04:21.079
As soon as they find that
gun, they'll hang me.

2022
02:04:21.104 --> 02:04:23.070
No matter which district I'm in.

2023
02:04:23.906 --> 02:04:25.326
When can you go?

2024
02:04:28.286 --> 02:04:29.754
Tomorrow.

2025
02:04:29.779 --> 02:04:30.947
- Dawn.
- Okay.

2026
02:04:32.442 --> 02:04:33.443
Okay.

2027
02:04:35.408 --> 02:04:38.678
Meet me at the Hanging
Tree. First light.

2028
02:04:47.275 --> 02:04:48.309
Whoo-hoo!

2029
02:04:48.334 --> 02:04:51.016
We got one. I
think we got one.

2030
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:54.992
They say his name is Spruce.

2031
02:04:59.619 --> 02:05:01.031
<i>Three years...</i>

2032
02:05:01.329 --> 02:05:04.484
I fought for the
Capitol during the war.

2033
02:05:04.509 --> 02:05:06.478
I've been angry.

2034
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:09.797
But this is the first
time I've felt ashamed.

2035
02:05:10.487 --> 02:05:12.523
Get the other one up here.

2036
02:05:26.564 --> 02:05:27.742
Coryo.

2037
02:05:28.803 --> 02:05:30.352
Coryo. Coryo.

2038
02:05:30.377 --> 02:05:32.609
The Capitol has received
word via jabberjay

2039
02:05:32.634 --> 02:05:35.970
that these two men conspired
to break into our base's jail

2040
02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:37.763
and flee north

2041
02:05:37.914 --> 02:05:41.318
to release this
terrorist from captivity.

2042
02:05:41.343 --> 02:05:45.547
I'd expect this of a rebel
but not from one of our own.

2043
02:05:45.572 --> 02:05:48.086
This is treason,
plain and simple.

2044
02:05:48.345 --> 02:05:49.672
Play the recording!

2045
02:05:49.697 --> 02:05:51.367
<i>The leader, Spruce,</i>

2046
02:05:51.392 --> 02:05:52.773
<i>he wants to get his sister, Lil,</i>

2047
02:05:52.805 --> 02:05:54.382
<i>out of jail on base. Hoff
is going to execute her...</i>

2048
02:05:54.407 --> 02:05:55.508
No, Coryo. Coryo, help!

2049
02:05:55.533 --> 02:05:57.101
<i>Just because she knows the man</i>

2050
02:05:57.126 --> 02:05:59.071
<i>- that they killed. It's wrong.</i>
<i>- </i> No, no, no! Ma! Help! Ma!

2051
02:05:59.096 --> 02:06:00.332

No.

2058
02:06:59.010 --> 02:07:00.277

2059
02:07:01.405 --> 02:07:02.540

Are you thinkin'

2079
02:08:11.818 --> 02:08:14.187
I just wish there was
more I could've done.

2080
02:08:18.021 --> 02:08:20.123
I'm sorry you have
to leave this place.

2081
02:08:21.082 --> 02:08:23.218
Yeah, I'll miss the Covey.

2082
02:08:23.243 --> 02:08:25.345
Hope they'll follow
me someday, though.

2083
02:08:27.724 --> 02:08:29.492
You know what I won't miss?

2084
02:08:30.214 --> 02:08:31.414
People.

2085
02:08:31.983 --> 02:08:33.451
People aren't so bad.

2086
02:08:34.063 --> 02:08:35.860
Not really.

2087
02:08:36.535 --> 02:08:38.470
It's what the
world does to them.

2088
02:08:39.135 --> 02:08:40.969
Like all of us in the arena.

2089
02:08:43.486 --> 02:08:45.383
I think there's a
natural goodness

2090
02:08:45.408 --> 02:08:46.910
born into us all.

2091
02:08:46.935 --> 02:08:48.504
No, really.

2092
02:08:48.529 --> 02:08:52.500
You can either cross
that line into evil...

2093
02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:54.825
or not.

2094
02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:55.829
And it's our life's work

2095
02:08:55.854 --> 02:08:57.722
to stay on the right
side of that line.

2096
02:08:59.668 --> 02:09:01.404
- It's not always that simple.
- Mmm.

2097
02:09:01.429 --> 02:09:02.678
I know.

2098
02:09:03.163 --> 02:09:04.497
I'm a victor.

2099
02:09:05.461 --> 02:09:07.172
Sure will be nice not to
have to kill anyone else

2100
02:09:07.197 --> 02:09:08.832
up north, though, huh?

2101
02:09:09.077 --> 02:09:10.512
Three's enough for me.

2102
02:09:11.538 --> 02:09:12.813
I'm gonna make a walking stick.

2103
02:09:12.838 --> 02:09:14.907
You want one?

2104
02:09:14.932 --> 02:09:16.266
You killed three?

2105
02:09:18.705 --> 02:09:19.939
Who's the third?

2106
02:09:20.746 --> 02:09:21.580
What?

2107
02:09:21.605 --> 02:09:22.727
Person you killed, Coriolanus.

2108
02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:23.883
You said you killed
three people.

2109
02:09:23.908 --> 02:09:25.821
I only know about
two. Do not lie to me.

2110
02:09:27.906 --> 02:09:29.918
- Can you help me get this out?
- There was Bobbin in the arena

2111
02:09:29.943 --> 02:09:32.612
and Mayfair. And
who's the third?

2112
02:09:36.518 --> 02:09:37.619
My old self.

2113
02:09:39.877 --> 02:09:42.680
I killed him so I
could come with you.

2114
02:09:46.190 --> 02:09:47.390
Come on.

2115
02:09:54.328 --> 02:09:55.996
Why don't we stop
here at the cabin?

2116
02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:58.633
- Wait out the storm?
- We should really keep going.

2117
02:09:58.658 --> 02:10:00.559
We're gonna need
food, Lucy Gray.

2118
02:10:00.584 --> 02:10:02.104
Let's catch some fish
while we're here.

2119
02:10:12.649 --> 02:10:13.776
If you want to fish,

2120
02:10:13.801 --> 02:10:15.903
there's rods under
the floorboards.

2121
02:10:25.343 --> 02:10:26.411
These ones?

2122
02:10:26.436 --> 02:10:27.637
Uh-huh.

2123
02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:21.607
What is it?

2124
02:11:34.359 --> 02:11:35.571
It's the gun.

2125
02:11:36.689 --> 02:11:38.337
The one you fired at Mayfair.

2126
02:11:39.414 --> 02:11:43.718
Spruce must have known about this place.
If we destroy that gun, you're free.

2127
02:11:45.058 --> 02:11:46.425
You can go back home.

2128
02:11:47.308 --> 02:11:48.643
Will you?

2129
02:11:52.293 --> 02:11:53.561
No more loose ends.

2130
02:11:55.266 --> 02:11:56.734
Besides me.

2131
02:11:59.857 --> 02:12:01.149
Besides you?

2132
02:12:04.465 --> 02:12:05.834
You wouldn't tell anyone.

2133
02:12:08.031 --> 02:12:09.364
'Course not.

2134
02:12:16.479 --> 02:12:18.447
I'm just gonna go
dig up some katniss.

2135
02:12:18.472 --> 02:12:20.741
There's a good patch
down by the lake.

2136
02:12:20.845 --> 02:12:22.413
I thought it was
too early for that.

2137
02:12:22.438 --> 02:12:24.740
Well, the world
changes awful fast.

2138
02:12:25.509 --> 02:12:26.555
Lucy Gray.

2139
02:12:30.713 --> 02:12:32.126
It's still raining.

2140
02:12:34.764 --> 02:12:36.799
Well, I'm not made out of sugar.

2141
02:13:10.051 --> 02:13:11.118
Lucy Gray?

2142
02:13:13.402 --> 02:13:14.537
Lucy Gray?

2143
02:13:20.745 --> 02:13:22.546
Lucy Gray, where are you?

2144
02:13:24.636 --> 02:13:25.672
Hello?

2145
02:13:30.193 --> 02:13:31.233
Hey, did something happen?

2146
02:13:31.258 --> 02:13:32.367
Because if something's happened,

2147
02:13:32.392 --> 02:13:33.660
we can talk about it.

2148
02:13:36.461 --> 02:13:38.262
Are you hiding from me?

2149
02:13:42.689 --> 02:13:43.856
Lucy...

2150
02:13:58.725 --> 02:13:59.726
Ow!

2151
02:14:09.179 --> 02:14:11.247
Is that poisonous?

2152
02:14:11.272 --> 02:14:13.109
Are you trying to kill me?

2153
02:14:13.134 --> 02:14:14.434
Lucy Gray?

2154
02:14:16.252 --> 02:14:18.021
Lucy Gray!

2155
02:14:18.046 --> 02:14:20.815
I said, are you
trying to kill me?

2156
02:14:22.261 --> 02:14:24.547
After everything
I've done for you!

2157

How's the arm, Private?

2171
02:19:37.861 --> 02:19:40.030
The medic said you
took quite a bite.

2172
02:19:40.055 --> 02:19:43.687
Nothing that I won't have forgotten
about by the time I reach 2, sir.

2173
02:19:44.852 --> 02:19:48.508
There's been a change
of plan, Private Snow.

2174
02:19:56.795 --> 02:19:59.133
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Snow.</i>

2175
02:20:00.662 --> 02:20:02.914
You've passed all my tests.

2176
02:20:03.515 --> 02:20:05.855
I've asked President Ravinstill

2177
02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:08.049
to grant you a full pardon,

2178
02:20:08.074 --> 02:20:09.734
effective immediately.

2179
02:20:09.759 --> 02:20:12.930
I also told him that
you are too promising

2180
02:20:12.955 --> 02:20:14.423
to waste in the military.

2181
02:20:14.598 --> 02:20:16.733
So you'll be
studying under me now

2182
02:20:16.758 --> 02:20:19.260
at the Capitol University.

2183
02:20:19.285 --> 02:20:20.786
I can't afford University.

2184
02:20:20.821 --> 02:20:23.591
A certain Mr. Strabo
Plinth has offered

2185
02:20:23.616 --> 02:20:25.285
to pay for everything you need

2186
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:27.112
while you're there.

2187
02:20:27.137 --> 02:20:29.594
All for being such a good friend

2188
02:20:29.619 --> 02:20:30.921
to his Sejanus.

2189
02:20:30.954 --> 02:20:35.058
He doesn't know quite how good
a friend you were, of course.

2190
02:20:35.083 --> 02:20:38.187
I never mentioned
your little recording.

2191
02:20:39.319 --> 02:20:40.821
Quite impressive,

2192
02:20:40.846 --> 02:20:44.316
how you sent your only
friend to the noose

2193
02:20:44.341 --> 02:20:46.142
just to get my attention.

2194
02:20:46.167 --> 02:20:48.469
- That's not what I did.
- Are you sure?

2195
02:20:48.494 --> 02:20:51.798
Because I think that won you
the Plinth Prize, after all.

2196
02:20:53.589 --> 02:20:57.660
The President has agreed to
another year of the Games.

2197
02:20:58.343 --> 02:21:00.079
People watched.

2198
02:21:00.104 --> 02:21:02.125
And I have you to
thank for that.

2199
02:21:04.709 --> 02:21:06.898
But before I take
you under my wing,

2200
02:21:07.236 --> 02:21:11.141
after everything you've seen
out there in the real world,

2201
02:21:11.643 --> 02:21:14.289
let me ask you one final time.

2202
02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:17.236
What are the Hunger Games for?

2203
02:21:21.815 --> 02:21:24.184
I used to think that
the Hunger Games

2204
02:21:24.209 --> 02:21:26.478
were punishment
for the districts.

2205
02:21:28.802 --> 02:21:30.601
Then I thought they
served as a warning

2206
02:21:30.626 --> 02:21:33.061
to us here in the Capitol

2207
02:21:33.086 --> 02:21:35.388
about the threat
the districts posed.

2208
02:21:38.481 --> 02:21:41.383
Now I know the whole
world is an arena.

2209
02:21:42.705 --> 02:21:44.807
And we need the Hunger Games.

2210
02:21:45.433 --> 02:21:46.851
Every year.

2211
02:21:48.612 --> 02:21:52.359
To remind us all
who we truly are.

2212
02:21:53.356 --> 02:21:55.875
And who are you,
do you determine?

2213
02:21:58.316 --> 02:21:59.828
The victor.

2214
02:22:00.589 --> 02:22:03.492
Welcome home, Mr. Snow.

2215
02:22:31.888 --> 02:22:33.256
Oh!

2216
02:22:33.281 --> 02:22:36.508
You look so handsome.

2217
02:22:39.226 --> 02:22:40.494
What do you think?

2218
02:22:42.446 --> 02:22:46.918
I think you look just like
your father, Coriolanus.

2219
02:23:04.953 --> 02:23:06.952
Sejanus Plinth's
personal effects

2220
02:23:06.977 --> 02:23:08.203
from District 12.

2221
02:23:16.167 --> 02:23:18.669
I was going to return this
to his parents tonight.

2222
02:23:18.694 --> 02:23:19.795
As a gift.

2223
02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:21.937
It would have been
his 19th birthday.

2224
02:23:21.962 --> 02:23:23.196
But I think...

2225
02:23:25.456 --> 02:23:27.406
they would prefer just this.

2226
02:23:29.818 --> 02:23:31.386
Best friends.

2227
02:23:32.453 --> 02:23:34.223
You grew a heart
in the districts.

2228
02:23:34.248 --> 02:23:35.683
No, not in the districts.

2229
02:23:36.321 --> 02:23:37.956
In the Hunger Games.

2230
02:23:39.158 --> 02:23:40.825
I should be thanking you.

2231
02:23:41.242 --> 02:23:42.828
The credit for the Hunger Games

2232
02:23:42.853 --> 02:23:44.989
goes to your father.

2233
02:23:45.014 --> 02:23:46.616
Half of it, at least.

2234
02:23:46.641 --> 02:23:49.844
I only dreamt them
up as an assignment.

2235
02:23:49.869 --> 02:23:51.370
A joke.

2236
02:23:51.725 --> 02:23:53.062
I was drunk.

2237
02:23:53.889 --> 02:23:57.626
Devise a punishment for
our enemies so extreme,

2238
02:23:57.652 --> 02:24:01.422
they will never forget how
badly they've wronged us.

2239
02:24:04.847 --> 02:24:06.906
When I sobered up, I
wanted to destroy it.

2240
02:24:06.931 --> 02:24:10.336
But your father, my best friend,

2241
02:24:10.727 --> 02:24:12.828
he'd stolen it from me.

2242
02:24:13.696 --> 02:24:14.897
Put both our names on it,

2243
02:24:14.922 --> 02:24:17.891
taken it to Gaul
to rise up himself.

2244
02:24:21.826 --> 02:24:23.561
I tried morphling...

2245
02:24:25.252 --> 02:24:27.621
the night that first child fell.

2246
02:24:30.155 --> 02:24:32.723
I hoped the Games might die out.

2247
02:24:34.446 --> 02:24:36.948
I tried to stop them
however I could.

2248
02:24:39.816 --> 02:24:41.203
But then you came along.

2249
02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:44.226
Now the blood of so
many more generations

2250
02:24:44.251 --> 02:24:46.220
will be on my hands.

2251
02:24:46.584 --> 02:24:48.086
Because you've
shown us the price

2252
02:24:48.111 --> 02:24:50.562
people are willing to
pay for a good show.

2253
02:24:53.404 --> 02:24:54.471
Tell me...

2254
02:24:56.275 --> 02:24:58.676
was she sad when you left 12?

2255
02:24:59.721 --> 02:25:01.657
Your little songbird?

2256
02:25:02.534 --> 02:25:04.601
I expect it made us both sad.

2257
02:25:05.222 --> 02:25:08.892
My contacts inform me
that she's disappeared.

2258
02:25:08.917 --> 02:25:10.875
That the mayor might have
killed her out there.

2259
02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:13.037
But there's no proof.

2260
02:25:13.086 --> 02:25:15.088
It's a mystery.

2261
02:25:15.529 --> 02:25:18.961
And mysteries have a way
of driving people mad.

2262
02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:22.740
Look at you.

2263
02:25:23.423 --> 02:25:26.626
Heir to the Plinth fortune,
nothing in your way.

2264
02:25:28.047 --> 02:25:29.848
Snow lands on top.

2265
02:25:31.348 --> 02:25:32.349
Yeah.
