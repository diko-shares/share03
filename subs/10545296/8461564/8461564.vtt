that it was a mentor's job

our tributes to perform,

Maybe one day, you'll be
a Gamemaker like me.

531
00:25:27.095 --> 00:25:29.297

532

Oh, they'll continue.

533
00:25:31.632 --> 00:25:35.937
With performances like
young Mr. Snow's in that zoo.

534
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:40.274
And I came here to ask
your star mentor a question.

(STUDENTS WHISPERING)

536
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.280
What are
the Hunger Games for?

537
00:25:46.314 --> 00:25:47.982
They're to punish
the districts

538
00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:49.517
for their uprising,

539
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.652

the end of the war...

542
00:25:54.989 --> 00:25:57.692
Punishment can
take myriad forms.

543
00:25:57.725 --> 00:26:00.795
Why not drop bombs,
cancel food shipments,

stage executions?

545
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.898
Why Games?

546
00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:05.299
Shouldn't we be
asking ourselves

547
00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:06.968
whether or not they're right
in the first place?

548
00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:08.536
You have a problem
with my Games?

549
00:26:08.569 --> 00:26:11.506
Some of those kids
were two years old
when the war ended.

550
00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:14.375
The oldest of them
were only eight.

551
00:26:14.408 --> 00:26:17.212
The Capitol is supposed to be
everyone's government now.

552
00:26:17.246 --> 00:26:19.380
It is supposed to
protect all of us.

553
00:26:19.413 --> 00:26:21.616
I don't see
how making children

554
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:23.218
fight each other
to the death

555
00:26:23.252 --> 00:26:24.519
is protecting anyone.

556
00:26:24.552 --> 00:26:26.788
That sort of sympathy
might interfere

557
00:26:26.821 --> 00:26:28.890
with your
mentoring assignment.

558
00:26:28.923 --> 00:26:30.625
Perhaps the Capitol students

559
00:26:30.658 --> 00:26:33.228
are ill-suited to be
mentoring tributes.

560
00:26:33.262 --> 00:26:35.429

563
00:26:41.502 --> 00:26:43.571
Maybe Sejanus
is onto something here.

564
00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:45.173
Maybe we should be viewing

565
00:26:45.207 --> 00:26:48.042
those tributes as human beings.

566
00:26:48.075 --> 00:26:51.246
I mean, you saw those kids
in the zoo, they just...

567
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.514
they just wanted
to get to know Lucy Gray.

568
00:26:53.548 --> 00:26:55.183
If we need people to watch,

569
00:26:55.217 --> 00:26:56.450
we should be
letting them get closer

570
00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:58.186
to the tributes
before the Games.

571
00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.154
To make the stakes personal.

572
00:27:00.188 --> 00:27:02.089
Who will watch the Games
if they care

573
00:27:02.123 --> 00:27:03.691
what happens to the tributes?

574
00:27:03.724 --> 00:27:05.593
Everyone.

575
00:27:05.626 --> 00:27:07.361
If they thought
the tribute they cared about

576
00:27:07.395 --> 00:27:09.264
had a chance of winning.

577
00:27:09.298 --> 00:27:11.065
People need someone
to root for

578
00:27:11.098 --> 00:27:12.400
and someone
to root against.

579
00:27:12.433 --> 00:27:14.303
We need them to invest.

580
00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:16.571
And if we bend
a few Capitol laws,

581
00:27:16.604 --> 00:27:18.639
we could even
have them place bets.

582
00:27:19.774 --> 00:27:23.144
Look, I know Lucy Gray
may not win in the arena

583
00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:25.546
but if you
give her a chance,

584
00:27:26.447 --> 00:27:27.748
I would bet the Plinth Prize

585
00:27:27.782 --> 00:27:29.784
that she can win
people's attention.

586
00:27:29.817 --> 00:27:31.819

write up a proposal

those kids a scrap

a reason to do it?

a chance if he can't eat?

-See, I know.

I'm so blameless,
I'm choking on it.

605
00:28:31.612 --> 00:28:34.081
My father bought him for me,
you know, at the Reaping,

606
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:36.450
Just so he could show me

607
00:28:36.484 --> 00:28:38.920
that I could never
go back to 2.

608
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.458

is gonna kill me.
