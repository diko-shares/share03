1015

I'm sorry, Mrs. Grey, but my lieutenant

were sleeping together

What?

He tried to break it off,
you got upset,

1019

1021
01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.944
He says he came to your apartment
to try and straighten things out,

1022
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.363
but your security people got
involved and it all went south.

No, that is complete bullshit.

1178

when you have sex,

I was adopted. I was too young.

That must have been
what he meant

1515

when he said
that you owe him a life.

1516
01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:54.593
Because your parents
adopted you and not him.
