00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.899
<i>At first, I didn't believe it either.</i>

2
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.610
<i>But the gods of Olympus are real.</i>

3
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.117
<i>And sometimes,
these gods have children with humans...</i>

4
00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:20.119
<i>called half-bloods.</i>

5
00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.655
<i>I'm one of them.</i>

6
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:25.917
<i>I'm Percy Jackson.
Son of Poseidon, god of the sea.</i>

7
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.961
<i>Seven years ago, four of these children</i>

8
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.714
<i>were headed to
Camp Half-Blood...</i>

9
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.475
<i>the only place on Earth
that is safe for our kind.</i>

10
00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.228
<i>Only three of them made it.</i>

11
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.108
We're almost at camp!

12
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.368
Look out!

13
00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.580
Grover! Luke, help him!

14
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.622
Grover, are you okay?

15
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.826
My leg. It's stuck.

16
00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:13.835
Come on. I got you.

17
00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.507
Keep going.
I'll hold them off.

18
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.712
No, Thalia.
They'll kill you.

19
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.721
Go, Luke. I'll be
right behind you.

20
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.728
Over here!

21
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.309
Annabeth, come on!

22
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.613
Stay back.

23
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.289
Thalia, come on!

24
00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.330
No! Thalia!

25
00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:02.806
<i>Her name was Thalia, and
she gave her life to save three.</i>

26
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.143
<i>And so, as Thalia lay dying...</i>

27
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:15.606
<i>her father Zeus found
another way for her to live.</i>

28
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.999
<i>A way for all
half-bloods to live.</i>

29
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.040
<i>A gift to ensure no one in Camp
Half-Blood would die the same way.</i>

30
00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:43.888
<i>The barrier, to protect them from
those who lived for their death.</i>

31
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.011
Let's go!

32
00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:55.104
<i>Every day, the story of
Thalia's bravery inspires me.</i>

33
00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.609
<i>And her tree protects my home.</i>

34
00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.280
<i>But not always my head.</i>

35
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.834
How nice of you to show up
just to watch me win.

36
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.841
Everything they say about
you is wrong, Clarisse.

37
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.967
You actually do have a sense of humor.

38
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.140
There goes another one.

39
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.558
Go, Percy!

40
00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.521
Come on, Percy!
I got 50 drachma on you!

41
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.894
You bet on this?

42
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.733
What, is that wrong?

43
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:45.858
Oh!

44
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.738
'97 Xinomavro.
Would you like a taste?

45
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:53.534
Why do you torture yourself, Dionysus?

46
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.378
It was one transgression, one.

47
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.040
And with a naiad, for the sake of Olympus.

48
00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.255
How was I to know that
Zeus had a thing for her?

49
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.679
Or that he could hold a grudge for so long?

50
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.595
I think the fact that Zeus is immortal...

51
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.852
means there's no limit to how
long he can hold a grudge.

52
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.938
The Christians have a guy who
can do this trick in reverse.

53
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.690
Now, that's a god.

54
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.406
Aren't you tired of getting beat, Jackson?

55
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.714
Clarisse!

56
00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:53.100
Help!
Help me!

57
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.447
Tereus, grab my hand!

58
00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.119
Good luck with that.

59
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:15.664
I got you.

60
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.461
Thank you!

61
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:26.792
Percy!

62
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.481
Clarisse!
Clarisse! Clarisse!

63
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.821
So, what I'm wondering is, Percy...

64
00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.954
that first quest you went on,
beginner's luck, wasn't it?

65
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.659
Clarisse, he saved Olympus. That's
more than you've ever done.

66
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:02.877
Whatever.

67
00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.256
Even for the daughter of the god
of war, that girl's a mythic bi--

68
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:06.549
Don't listen to her, Percy.

69
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.342
You know, it's too late.

70
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.719
Besides, she has a point.

71
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.471
Dude, what are you talking about?

72
00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.640
You're more than
a one-quest wonder.

73
00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.809
You recovered Ares' stolen chariot.

74
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.182
No, actually, that was Clarisse.

75
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.689
Okay, what about the Fall Tournament?
You owned that sucker.

76
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:22.765
Mmm-mmm.

77
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.896
- Clarisse?
- Mmm-hmm.

78
00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.854
Okay, the Solstice Games?
The Bronze Dragon's Quest?

79
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.827
Thank you for trying to cheer me up.

80
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.741
I would lick a pair of cloven hooves...

81
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.788
before I let you listen to
Clarisse instead of us.

82
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:39.865
No offense, Grover.

83
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.792
None taken.
Is that an offer?

84
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.165
Listen, it doesn't matter
what Clarisse has done.

85
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.622
To Chiron and Mr. D,
you're still the rock star.

86
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.503
Perry Johnson!

87
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.044
Actually, it's Percy Jackson, sir.

88
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.211
Whatever.

89
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.052
I have a very important task
to entrust you with.

90
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.177
You do?

91
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.260
Yes, it's a critical assignment.
And it's very taxing.

92
00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.595
Can I trust you?

93
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:01.679
Of course.

94
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.856
Good. You'll need this.

95
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:10.359
Sometimes these events get a little messy.

96
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.906
<i>Maybe Clarisse was right.</i>

97
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.753
Maybe I only stopped Luke
from destroying Olympus...

98
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.923
because I had Annabeth and
Grover helping me, right?

99
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.002
Dad?

100
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.921
Poseidon?

101
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:48.351
Have you ever felt like
everything you've ever done...

102
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.520
maybe you didn't really do it?

103
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.818
It was all just luck or something?

104
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.611
No, of course not.

105
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.324
You're a god.

106
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.623
Speaking as someone who's not, it sucks.

107
00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:12.838
It makes you question whether you
were all that good to begin with.

108
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:22.014
Okay. Good not talking to you.

109
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:23.681
Again.

110
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.325
So, he just walked right in? He
just walked straight into camp?

111
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.403
It seems he lumbered, actually.

112
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.572
I don't care if he sashayed!

113
00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.456
What's the point of having this mystical

114
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.291
protective barrier if
any thing can just--

115
00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:47.709
Could you not touch that, please?

116
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.203
That's a very precious Grenache.

117
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.287
I think the point is...

118
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:53.499
since he did pass right through
the barrier from Thalia's tree...

119
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.177
- Don't say it.
- ...it means he's most likely a god-spawn.

120
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.932
Yeah, but the spawn of which god?

121
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.843
I know.

122
00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.393
Poseidon.

123
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.781
So, why did Mr. D summon you?
It's not good to get summoned.

124
00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.160
I'm sure it's fine.

125
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.662
I'm sure you don't get
summoned to the Big House

126
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.038
without a major-league
screw-up.

127
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.290
I didn't screw up.

128
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.793
I cleaned the entire
coliseum. And vacuumed.

129
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.874
Don't let him get into your head, okay?

130
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.836
We have a dead camper walking.
Dead camper walking, here.

131
00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.761
Thanks. This
is friendship.

132
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.797
I'm just playing, just
trying to have a little fun.

133
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.132
It's all right.

134
00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.346
So, it's okay if I get your
cabin when you get kicked out?

135
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.803
Seriously, don't worry.
It's just Mr. D.

136
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:51.106
I mean, if Chiron had summoned you, then...

137
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.900
Oh, you are so massively screwed.

138
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.652
Whatever it is you think
I did, I didn't do it.

139
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.320
You've done nothing, Percy.

140
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.621
Exactly.

141
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.251
As you know, you are believed
to be Poseidon's only heir.

142
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.127
Yeah, so?

143
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:16.416
So, it would seem that belief
has been held in error.

144
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.668
Hold on. You're saying Percy has a brother?

145
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:20.297
Or a sister.

146
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:26.100
Holy Styx. Another
Poseidon half-blood.

147
00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:28.935
Not exactly.

148
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.598
Technically,
Tyson is not a half-blood.

149
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.017
Half-bloods are half-human,
hence the name.

150
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.352
I don't get it.

151
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.735
If this new kid is not half-human,
then what other half is he?

152
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.032
Nymph. Sea nymph.

153
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.364
And when you cross a deity
with a nymph, you get...

154
00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.117
Don't touch.
It's a Gewürztraminer.

155
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.531
Hi.

156
00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.617
Hi, Brother.

157
00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:16.267
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.

158
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.478
Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:24.658
Hey, they put peppers in yours.
Are you gonna eat that?

160
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.031
Go ahead.

161
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.787
Is he messing with me?

162
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.247
I think he's hungry.

163
00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.374
No, not him.
I meant Poseidon.

164
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.413
Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?

165
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.842
A half-brother?
A Cyclops? Come on.

166
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.969
I think the politically correct
term is "ocularly impaired."

167
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.598
And a half-brother
is better than nothing.

168
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.096
I like having a brother.

169
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.802
Dad was cool to bring me here.

170
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.183
- Dad? Dad brought you here?
- Uh-huh.

171
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.269
I was upstate, in the woods.

172
00:12:56.359 --> 00:13:00.569
One day, this trident shows up over my
head, and then it started moving south.

173
00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:04.194
And you followed it.
You followed it here.

174
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.199
It glowed.

175
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.407
Well, somebody has got a new brother.

176
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.827
And I can see he's got his daddy's eyes.

177
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:13.991
Well...

178
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.701
"Eye."

179
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.213
You should really get him
some sprayable mist.

180
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:23.421
Anyway, it is kind of interesting
timing, don't you think?

181
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:28.555
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed
another son to, you know...

182
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.841
represent.

183
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.384
Bull.

184
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.014
Excuse me?

185
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:34.519
Smells like bull.

186
00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.732
We got barrier action.

187
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.073
Hey, Chris, you coming?

188
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.408
No, I'm good.

189
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.921
That is so awesome.

190
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.631
It's chill.
The barrier is holding.

191
00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:19.810
A Colchis bull.

192
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.108
Run!

193
00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.155
Percy!

194
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.328
Come on!

195
00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.025
- We have to find its weak spot.
- Does it have one?

196
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.152
Percy, distract it for me.

197
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.072
Hey!

198
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:18.824
Hey!

199
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.362
I got this.

200
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.656
Bad bull.

201
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:39.742
Hey, rust bucket!

202
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.244
Damn it, Jackson.

203
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:08.248
Do you have any idea how hard
Colchis bulls are to come by?

204
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.876
Maybe next time you try to drown someone...

205
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:17.845
you'll first make sure he's
not a demigod who can swim.

206
00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.266
Luke?

207
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.892
Turns out, you're not the only
half-blood who's hard to kill.

208
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.685
You know, prophecy.

209
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.943
What prophecy? What are you talking about?

210
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.607
You don't know?

211
00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:40.404
Huh.

212
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:45.452
Add that to the long list of things your
buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.

213
00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:49.581
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest...

214
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.708
they don't care about us.

215
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:56.049
To them, we're just kids.

216
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:59.507
A bunch of pawns meant to be
pushed around, told what to do.

217
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.347
I'm not the only half-blood
who thinks so.

218
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.555
Think about it.

219
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.317
What did I miss?

220
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.617
Where's Percy?

221
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.821
Last time I saw him, he was getting
dragged by a Colchis bull.

222
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.781
Hey, you.

223
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.541
How come you aren't barbecued?

224
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.209
Cyclopes are fireproof.

225
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.753
How did the bull get through the barrier?

226
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:37.089
Oh, my gods.

227
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:01.239
Poisoned.

228
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.321
Is she...
Is the tree dead?

229
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:05.110
No, but dying.

230
00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:11.492
A condition we're about to
become all too familiar with.

231
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:15.996
Everybody, we're going to need a guard
detail to patrol the perimeter.

232
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:19.086
It feels like she's dying all over again.

233
00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.260
Who would do this?

234
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.971
Luke poisoned the tree.

235
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.094
Percy!

236
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.222
Yay, you're alive.

237
00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.145
Yeah, I'm not the only one.

238
00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.264
Luke let the bull in.

239
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:35.853
Without the tree's barrier...

240
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:39.527
he probably figures there's enough Demi-Titans
out there to get him what he wants.

241
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.821
And that would be what, exactly?

242
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.234
Our annihilation,
Ms. La Rue.

243
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.865
Our annihilation.

244
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.454
How's the antidote coming?

245
00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.834
Slowly.

246
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.668
I know this probably isn't the best time...

247
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.471
but there's something I have to ask you.

248
00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:07.923
What is it?

249
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.511
It was something Luke
said about a prophecy...

250
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:14.680
how I'm mentioned in it.

251
00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.566
Do you know anything about this?

252
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.111
Knowledge isn't always power, Percy.

253
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.902
Sometimes, it's a burden.

254
00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.116
I know that.

255
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:31.116
But like you said, I've been
pretty unexceptional lately.

256
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:35.372
It's got me wondering
if I'm prophecy-worthy.

257
00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:37.831
They say that when the gods
wish to torture us...

258
00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.709
they answer our prayers.

259
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:43.546
Necklace of Harmonia,
Hercules' bow, Golden Apple of Discord.

260
00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.510
Three millennia of gods and demigods...

261
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:48.680
you'd think that someone would have
come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.

262
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:52.476
Persephone did come up with
Miracle-Gro. Maybe we can try that.

263
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:53.931
That's it.

264
00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.479
Right here.

265
00:21:57.775 --> 00:22:00.984
That is not gonna cure Thalia's
tree so much as get us all killed.

266
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.311
Me, in particular.

267
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:05.238
It's perfect. It's exactly what we need.

268
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:08.199
I'm taking this to Mr. D.

269
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.401
No.

270
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:18.995
I was hoping to spare you this onus a
little while longer, but go inside.

271
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:20.579
Upstairs, to the attic.

272
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:23.165
And when you come back down,
we'll talk some more.

273
00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.002
Assuming you're still sane, that is.

274
00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:01.461
I am the spirit of Delphi...

275
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.464
speaker of the prophecies
of Phoebus Apollo...

276
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.966
slayer of the mighty Python.

277
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:10.800
Approach, seeker, and ask.

278
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:15.600
I heard there was a prophecy about me.

279
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.135
Aye.

280
00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:22.149
But before you learn the
future, know first the past.

281
00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:27.487
<i>Long ago, before our time...</i>

282
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.693
<i>before Olympus and the gods...</i>

283
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:33.156
<i>Titans ruled the world.</i>

284
00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.445
<i>Led by Kronos...</i>

285
00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:40.038
<i>a force so evil,
he devoured his own children.</i>

286
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.702
<i>But three of his sons escaped.</i>

287
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.169
<i>Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.</i>

288
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.762
<i>They destroyed Kronos...</i>

289
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:57.468
<i>and banished his remains
to the depths of Tartarus.</i>

290
00:23:58.187 --> 00:24:02.352
<i>But Kronos is fated to rise again...</i>

291
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:07.269
<i>to exact his vengeance on
Olympus, and the world.</i>

292
00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:14.364
<i>Only one half-blood child of the
three eldest gods can defeat him.</i>

293
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:17.779
<i>This child shall be our salvation...</i>

294
00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:21.121
<i>or the cause of our destruction.</i>

295
00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:28.374
<i>It all begins when two cousins
grapple for a fleece...</i>

296
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:31.752
<i>the son of the sea and the lightning thief.</i>

297
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:33.712
Luke.

298
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.381
And that half-blood
of the eldest gods...

299
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.551
shall reach 20 against all odds.

300
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:42.971
"And see the world in endless sleep...

301
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.937
"the evil soul, cursed blade shall reap.

302
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:48.977
"A single choice shall end his days...

303
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:52.439
"Olympus to preserve or raze."

304
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:56.075
And that is "raze" with a "Z,"
as in "destroy."

305
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.069
I asked.

306
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:04.451
Is there any chance, any chance at all...

307
00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:07.917
that I might not be
the guy in the prophecy?

308
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.924
The Oracle references a
half-blood of the eldest gods.

309
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.130
You are the only living half-blood
heir of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.

310
00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.639
The prophecy could refer only to you.

311
00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:22.428
What if I destroy Olympus...

312
00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.768
by not being good enough to save it?

313
00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:29.275
That seems to be the question, doesn't it?

314
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.232
It's absolutely out of the question.

315
00:25:32.322 --> 00:25:34.063
If you could just listen
to me for one moment--

316
00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:36.115
I am listening.
You want to go on a quest.

317
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.533
Oh! It must be Thursday.

318
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.407
I'm serious. I'm absolutely
sure that this is gonna work.

319
00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:44.540
It was such a good year.

320
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.327
The Golden Fleece can heal any
living person or thing...

321
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.754
including Thalia's tree.

322
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:53.087
We heal the tree, we restore
the barrier around camp.

323
00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:56.424
I'm surprised you want to go along
with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.

324
00:25:56.513 --> 00:25:57.503
Underwood.

325
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:58.759
Whatever.

326
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:02.600
Every satyr who has ever gone
after the Fleece has died.

327
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.262
Right?
I mentioned that to her.

328
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.900
But it's a risk I'm willing to
take for the good of the camp.

329
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.902
Look, the last I heard...

330
00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:15.735
the Golden Fleece
was in the Sea of Monsters...

331
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:17.907
what the humans call the Bermuda Triangle.

332
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.406
A place not only a satyr
should be afraid of.

333
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:24.206
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

334
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.281
Annabeth.

335
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:28.543
Whatever.
It's a terrible idea.

336
00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:31.170
I've had a grand idea.

337
00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.466
Unless Thalia's tree can be cured...

338
00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:39.801
and the protective barrier
around our camp restored...

339
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:43.637
then every demigod, centaur,
satyr and nymph...

340
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:46.511
will be killed within days, if not sooner.

341
00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:48.312
Hey, you okay?

342
00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.433
Don't worry, camp will be okay.

343
00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:53.893
You have to have faith, right?

344
00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:56.604
But fortunately,
I have considered the matter.

345
00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:58.356
And after great study...

346
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.066
I have determined that the only thing

347
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.784
that has the power to save Thalia's tree...

348
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.611
and therefore our home...

349
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.742
is the Golden Fleece of myth...

350
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.288
What?

351
00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:11.248
...whose touch...

352
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:17.292
...can heal every person
and every thing.

353
00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:22.886
So, a quest, a mission
of mercy, if you will...

354
00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.516
into uncharted and deadly waters...

355
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.932
with nothing less at stake
than our own survival.

356
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:35.232
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn, as
you know, to the power of the Fleece.

357
00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:39.489
And therefore, it must be a satyr who
will guide a half-blood on this quest.

358
00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:41.316
Thanks a lot.

359
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:42.859
Ichneutae!

360
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.657
Will you guide the champion?

361
00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:47.538
Oh, yeah.

362
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:50.542
Good. Great! That's great!

363
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.910
Yeah!

364
00:27:55.883 --> 00:28:00.924
As to who that champion might be, our
plight calls for only our finest hero.

365
00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:05.841
The best of us, the
strongest and the bravest.

366
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:09.511
The scion of the god of war...

367
00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:10.724
Clarisse!

368
00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:12.305
Yes!

369
00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:17.150
Thank you.

370
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.146
Her name, he gets right.

371
00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:27.154
Hey, Clarisse.
Clarisse!

372
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:29.038
What? Oh.

373
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:31.537
Don't worry about always
coming in second, Jackson.

374
00:28:31.627 --> 00:28:33.209
You do get used to it.

375
00:28:33.295 --> 00:28:35.332
I think, right? Obviously, I wouldn't know.

376
00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:36.629
Listen, Luke is still out there.

377
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:39.128
He's involved with the Fleece somehow...

378
00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:41.964
and I've got a feeling
that he's not done yet.

379
00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:43.044
Really?

380
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.888
Because I've got a feeling
that I don't really care.

381
00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:47.806
Gosh, don't look so wounded.

382
00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:51.306
Listen, there are generals,
and there are foot soldiers.

383
00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:54.560
And you should feel lucky that you
even made it into the army at all.

384
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:58.234
Just try not to screw up anything
too badly while I'm gone. Okay?

385
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.440
Let's go.

386
00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:12.915
"Cursed blade shall reap."

387
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.620
"Cursed blade shall reap."

388
00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:21.712
What good is a prophecy if you
can't even understand it?

389
00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:27.881
I guess you don't have
any answers either, Dad.

390
00:29:29.351 --> 00:29:31.013
This was your sword.

391
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:44.355
This is a bad idea.

392
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.735
You don't even know what I was gonna say.

393
00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.318
You were going to say that you're going
after the Fleece to save the camp.

394
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:50.904
Actually, he was gonna say "we" were.

395
00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:54.290
Look, I get what you're doing here.

396
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.995
You're worried about
the one-quest wonder thing...

397
00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:57.793
and you want to make your bones.

398
00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:00.041
But Ichneutae and Clarisse are
already going after the Fleece...

399
00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:02.499
and it's not cool to Bogart
on someone else's quest.

400
00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:04.379
I think this is my quest, too.

401
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.256
The Oracle says he wrestles
Luke for the Fleece.

402
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:09.635
"Grapples."
But she also said...

403
00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:13.802
that I'm destined to destroy
Olympus, or save it.

404
00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:19.269
Saving is better, obviously.

405
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:20.900
Yeah.

406
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:25.237
Let me pack a bag and make sure
my health insurance is paid up.

407
00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:42.998
How are we gonna get past them?

408
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.087
I think they're looking for
threats trying to come in...

409
00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:47.590
not people trying to sneak out...

410
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:50.221
so, I think we're cool
as long as we stay quiet.

411
00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:53.758
Sorry!

412
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.510
Shh!

413
00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.267
We're...

414
00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.141
We're guarding, too.

415
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:04.609
You left without me.

416
00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:07.439
Tyson, where we're going,
it's very dangerous.

417
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:09.027
I know. I'm not stupid.

418
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:10.449
No, just dumb.

419
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.034
I want to help.

420
00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:14.954
You'd do it for me.

421
00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:16.659
I appreciate that...

422
00:31:16.833 --> 00:31:20.702
but I don't think you understand exactly
how dangerous this is going to be.

423
00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:21.957
I do.

424
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.087
The Fleece is guarded by Polyphemus.

425
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:25.547
Who?

426
00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:26.795
Polyphemus.

427
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:29.631
Closest thing Cyclopes
have got to someone famous.

428
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:33.010
Captured Odysseus.
Lives in Circeland.

429
00:31:33.183 --> 00:31:34.674
Wait, Circeland?

430
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.810
Built on his island.
Long story.

431
00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.141
Point is, maybe I can talk to him.

432
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:42.307
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

433
00:31:42.484 --> 00:31:45.397
No, you can't, because I'm
not going with a Cyclops.

434
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:50.069
Then we got a problem, because
I'm not going without one.

435
00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:54.577
This Polyphemus is probably what killed
every satyr that's gone near the Fleece.

436
00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:56.620
You want me to lead
you to a Cyclops? Fine.

437
00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:59.995
But I'm bringing along one
of my own, for protection.

438
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:01.910
No way.

439
00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:03.369
No.

440
00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:13.258
What do you think's gonna
attract more attention...

441
00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:14.930
all the noise or the one eye?

442
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:17.008
Just give the guy a break, okay?

443
00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:19.684
Okay, fine.

444
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:20.761
Shh! Keep it down.

445
00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:23.098
This is crazy hard to come by...

446
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:25.267
and I only brought it along
in case of an emergency...

447
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.604
which I guess this is an
emergency, so... here.

448
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.236
Mist?

449
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.447
It makes the mystical look normal.

450
00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:37.745
"Side effects may include
handsomeness, headache,

451
00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:39.663
"self-esteem and
low self-esteem."

452
00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:41.661
And just know that if the
camp wasn't in danger...

453
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.117
I wouldn't be wasting this on you.

454
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:44.577
Wasting what?

455
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:50.049
It's not gonna last forever.
You're gonna have to reapply it.

456
00:32:58.894 --> 00:33:01.136
Extreme makeover alert.
Whoop, whoop!

457
00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:05.397
How do I look?

458
00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:09.106
A bit like Dad, actually.

459
00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:11.271
He's still a Cyclops.

460
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:16.234
Grover, where are we going?
What does your nose say?

461
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:19.821
Uh, somewhere off the
coast of Florida. South.

462
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:23.036
Over here.

463
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.667
Annie! Hey!

464
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.717
It's the Chariot of Damnation.

465
00:33:40.894 --> 00:33:43.011
Looks like a New York City cab.

466
00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:44.554
Same difference.

467
00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:49.521
No dollars, no credit cards.
Drachmas only.

468
00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:51.481
Exact... Change... Please.

469
00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.317
Chop, chop!
Get in the cab.

470
00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:56.274
We just had this cab sanitized
for your protection.

471
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.783
It wasn't this year, though.

472
00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:00.031
Excuse me, we're trying to get to Florida.

473
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.613
Our kind
of fare. Pricey.

474
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.910
Whoa!

475
00:34:08.004 --> 00:34:10.792
<i>Hey, there. This is Ganymede,
cupbearer to Zeus.</i>

476
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:13.333
<i>And when I'm out buying wine
for the lord of the skies...</i>

477
00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:15.292
<i>I always remember to buckle up.</i>

478
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:17.674
Maybe we should have flown commercial.

479
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.181
Look out!

480
00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:26.433
Calm down. If we didn't
know what we were doing...

481
00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:28.185
We wouldn't be licensed.

482
00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:32.647
They don't have eyes.

483
00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:34.854
Yeah.

484
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:38.574
- I know, awful picture.
- Bad hair day.

485
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.071
We do so have an eye.

486
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.823
It's around here somewhere.

487
00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:43.154
The last time I saw it, you put it

488
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:44.572
in the glove compartment, Anger.

489
00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:46.077
Don't use that tone with my name.

490
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.954
It's not there this time.

491
00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:49.034
Ah!

492
00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:52.671
Wasp always puts it with the keys.

493
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.544
And it's 20/20.

494
00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:56.008
So is mine!

495
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.260
Shouldn't the driver get the eye?

496
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.009
She'll be fine.

497
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:06.639
Tempest, split!

498
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:13.559
Percy!

499
00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:18.360
We paid extra for that option.

500
00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:25.571
The kid is right. The driver
should have the eyeball.

501
00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:26.872
He's a freaking genius!

502
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.415
You're the one that put it in the visor.

503
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:31.460
While it's on the table, I haven't
had a turn in quite some time.

504
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:34.914
Oh, no, you didn't!

505
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:36.252
Yes, I did.

506
00:35:39.346 --> 00:35:40.928
Hands on the wheel at least, okay?

507
00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.433
- We're all gonna die!
- Pipe down.

508
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:49.853
Didn't that prophecy say you're
gonna make it till at least 20?

509
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:51.020
You know about the prophecy?

510
00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:52.848
- Oh, sure.
- The Oracle is a friend.

511
00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:54.808
- We're besties.
- B-F-F!

512
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.310
Ugh!

513
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:57.645
Eye! Eye! Eye!

514
00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.734
Gross! Get it off me!

515
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:04.910
What do you know about the prophecy?

516
00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:07.863
No!

517
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.285
Okay, okay.

518
00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:19.334
30, 31, 75, 12.

519
00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:20.501
What?

520
00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:23.345
Percy, you got your answer!

521
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.013
All I got were numbers.

522
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.557
- Yes.
- You'll know...

523
00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:28.388
When it matters.

524
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.351
I think we're a little short on drachmas.

525
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:34.431
What?

526
00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:48.321
What do you... think we're...
running here?

527
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:49.371
A charity?

528
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:50.948
- Get your cheap butts...
- Out!

529
00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:02.585
That was...

530
00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:03.969
I know.

531
00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:07.473
Awesome!
Can we go again?

532
00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:09.759
We're definitely not in Florida.

533
00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:13.312
I think we're in Olympus.

534
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.229
Hail to you, great Zeus! Forgive
our trespass on Olympus.

535
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:20.065
We're seeking transport to Florida.

536
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:21.812
Zeus?

537
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:23.480
Zeus?

538
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:24.982
Zeus?

539
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.198
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!
This isn't Olympus, okay?

540
00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:29.904
This is the Capitol building.

541
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:32.832
We're in Washington,
D.C. Okay?

542
00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:34.575
Oh.

543
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.247
It looks like Olympus.

544
00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:39.250
Right down to the dudes with power
who only care about themselves.

545
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.206
We need to find a bus station.

546
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:42.917
First we need to get some money.

547
00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:50.929
<i>Hey, there, valued
half-blood account holder!</i>

548
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:52.851
<i>Sign up for our new Aphrodite
Express credit card...</i>

549
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.053
<i>And you can--</i>

550
00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:58.187
Can I get four venti
half-caf no-whip lattes?

551
00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:01.147
And an extra shot of nectar.

552
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.400
Nectar?

553
00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:11.329
If you haven't had, then
you haven't lived, buddy.

554
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:19.374
Hecatonshire.

555
00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:21.129
- Hey.
- Whoa.

556
00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:23.795
I see you got your hands full.

557
00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:27.886
Room for cream?

558
00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:31.056
Nectar. Double shot.

559
00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:41.183
I've lived.

560
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.528
This might be the most fun I've ever had.

561
00:38:44.697 --> 00:38:45.858
Ever.

562
00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:49.571
Yeah, anything's gotta be better
than living in the woods, right?

563
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.160
Living in the woods would have
been fine if you were there.

564
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.409
Everything's better with a brother.

565
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.996
You know, technically,
we don't have the same mom.

566
00:38:58.086 --> 00:39:01.705
So we're still brothers!
I know! How cool is that?

567
00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:03.247
Arctic.

568
00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.341
It's too sweet, don't you think?

569
00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:08.760
No, nectar's never too sweet.

570
00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.842
Get off me!

571
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.102
- Get off me!
- Grover!

572
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.402
Percy!

573
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.449
- Damn!
- Was that Chris Rodriguez?

574
00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:36.363
How did they do that?

575
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:41.414
Back at camp, Luke said that there
were other half-bloods who turned.

576
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.291
What do you mean, "turned"?

577
00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:45.498
To his side.

578
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.709
Luke has Grover.

579
00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.636
The Oracle was right.

580
00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:55.095
Luke is going after the Fleece.
That's why he needs a satyr.

581
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.222
But what does Luke want
with the Fleece anyway?

582
00:39:57.312 --> 00:39:58.393
I don't know.

583
00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:00.641
But if we're gonna get Grover
back, we need to find Luke.

584
00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:02.064
But we don't know where he is.

585
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.773
I know someone who does.
Come on.

586
00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:20.199
What, are we shipping ourselves overnight
express to the Sea of Monsters?

587
00:40:20.293 --> 00:40:23.457
You want to find Luke?
His dad will know where he is.

588
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.133
Olympic Parcel Service.
Come on.

589
00:40:33.306 --> 00:40:36.515
Like it? He'll love it. Yes,
Hephaestus does do quality work.

590
00:40:36.643 --> 00:40:38.430
Everyone else these days, hacks.

591
00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:40.226
Excuse me, we're looking for Hermes.

592
00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:43.272
I'm sorry to be the god of
obviousness, but I'm with a customer.

593
00:40:43.358 --> 00:40:46.726
You want an overnight shipment to
Hades, that will be 250 drachmas.

594
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:49.691
Perfect.
Thank you, sweetness.

595
00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:53.198
I will take care of that for
you, and I'll see you next week.

596
00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.317
Now, you.

597
00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:57.077
You are here about Hermes?

598
00:40:57.163 --> 00:40:59.029
His son, actually.
It's kind of important.

599
00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.957
Yeah, I could tell the way you
burst in here, all rude-like.

600
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:03.534
His son's name is Luke Castellan.

601
00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:10.715
What has that wayward boy of
mine gotten himself into now?

602
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:13.006
Wait, you're...

603
00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:14.132
Hermes.

604
00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:16.513
Little insulted you didn't recognize me.

605
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:19.933
My feelings might have even been hurt if I
wasn't such a self-confident individual.

606
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:22.056
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm killing these shorts.

607
00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:23.227
Sir, we're looking for Luke...

608
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.476
because he attacked Camp Half-Blood
and kidnapped our friend.

609
00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:28.309
And we really need your help, and
we don't have a lot of time.

610
00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:31.612
That's really cute, how you
finish each other's sentences.

611
00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:33.946
Follow.

612
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.869
You like this tie? I just bought it.
Hermès, of course.

613
00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:40.453
Check it out.

614
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.123
State-of-the-art sorting,
processing and packaging facility.

615
00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.952
If you can box it, we can
ship it at the speed of...

616
00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:47.627
Well, me.

617
00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:49.288
We have plans to expand next year.

618
00:41:49.424 --> 00:41:50.881
We're finding we have some space issues.

619
00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:52.754
So picture this, only bigger.

620
00:41:52.844 --> 00:41:53.960
Don't touch that.

621
00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:56.136
We're the fastest-growing
Olympian industry.

622
00:41:56.222 --> 00:41:57.429
It took a while to get up and running,

623
00:41:57.598 --> 00:41:58.839
but Rome wasn't built in a day.

624
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:00.219
Trust me, I was there.

625
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:02.642
Excuse me, sir, we're in a bit of a hurry.

626
00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:04.470
Relax, my friend.
Take it slow.

627
00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:06.851
Oh, come on!
Give me a break!

628
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.733
Easy for you to say, Your Eminence.

629
00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:11.768
Actually, Martha, it's not easy for him.

630
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:13.736
He's the god of freaking speed.

631
00:42:13.823 --> 00:42:18.443
Except he's not the one whose butt is
stuck to a big silver stick forever!

632
00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:21.111
Hey, guys, what did I say?

633
00:42:21.289 --> 00:42:24.453
When we meet new people, protract your S's.
It's more dramatic.

634
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:25.999
Makes an impression.

635
00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:29.211
Ugh! I'm personally insulted.
Snakes don't talk like that.

636
00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:31.539
It is a stereotype and it's offensive.

637
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:33.999
Mmm-hmm! Bad enough some of our relatives
are hanging out with Medusa...

638
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.254
turning people to stone.

639
00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:36.334
All right.

640
00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:38.637
Ooh! I love your hair.
I wish my hair would do that.

641
00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:39.930
Yeah, that will happen.

642
00:42:40.016 --> 00:42:42.429
Why don't you guys make yourselves useful?

643
00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:44.805
Demi-Google Luke for me. These
kids are looking for him.

644
00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:46.637
- Why?
- Do they have a death wish?

645
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:48.472
It doesn't matter. Just...

646
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:49.682
Didn't even say "please."

647
00:42:49.776 --> 00:42:52.063
Told you! We should have
taken that job with Hercules.

648
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:53.940
They're an acquired taste.

649
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.317
Luke. I don't know
what to do about him.

650
00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:59.525
I've tried reaching out, but the kid's angry.
He's resentful.

651
00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.326
And he holds a grudge
like nobody's business.

652
00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.903
Just like his mother, come to think of it.

653
00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:04.863
Yeah, he's not my biggest fan either.

654
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:08.826
If you're gonna cross paths or,
Zeus forbid, swords with him...

655
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:12.917
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
to have a thing or two to help you out.

656
00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.044
Collector's item, mint condition.

657
00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:17.626
From <i>Hercules Busts Heads,</i> Season One.

658
00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.295
<i>Hercules Busts Heads?</i>

659
00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:20.838
Best TV show ever.

660
00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:23.932
So, of course, cancelled.

661
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:26.431
Got this off Deity-Bay.

662
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.688
You twist the cap off this, you release the
winds from the four corners of the Earth.

663
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.936
Now, you tell me that isn't cool.

664
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.692
Whoa! No, not in here!

665
00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:35.443
Not in here.

666
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.944
By the gods, George was right.
You do have a death wish.

667
00:43:39.784 --> 00:43:41.241
Now, you're also...

668
00:43:42.662 --> 00:43:44.870
You're also gonna want one of these.

669
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:52.085
Um, thanks.

670
00:43:52.171 --> 00:43:54.083
Mythical box sealer?

671
00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:57.000
You wound me.
Truly, I am wounded.

672
00:43:57.176 --> 00:44:00.419
I hold in my hands a Matter Eliminator.
Trademark pending.

673
00:44:00.596 --> 00:44:02.258
Anything you outline with this...

674
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:03.509
Not in here.

675
00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:05.299
...will disappear.

676
00:44:05.393 --> 00:44:07.350
Whoosh! Gone.
Instant hole.

677
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:08.722
"Demi-Google Luke,"
he said.

678
00:44:08.813 --> 00:44:10.896
Except, how am I supposed
to type without fingers?

679
00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:12.518
You were supposed to use the mouse!

680
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:14.019
I'm a snake.
I eat mice.

681
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.942
All right, thank you.
Have you found Luke?

682
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:17.235
Did he just say "thank you"?

683
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.903
I'm sure it was just a lapse.

684
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.606
Luke's on a yacht called the <i>Andromeda.</i>

685
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.113
It's passing by Chesapeake
Beach as we speak.

686
00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:24.192
Thank you.

687
00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:26.028
You're sssso welcome.

688
00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:27.488
There, you happy?

689
00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:29.073
Hush.

690
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:31.704
Thank you very much.

691
00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:33.285
Hey, listen...

692
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:34.452
Um...

693
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.706
If you see Luke...

694
00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:41.127
please explain to him for me...

695
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.469
that parents, we make mistakes sometimes.

696
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:48.718
He has every right to be angry at me.

697
00:44:48.895 --> 00:44:51.182
Just, please tell him not
to be angry with the world.

698
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:55.524
I'm not sure if there's anything
that I can say that will change him.

699
00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:56.934
Try.

700
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.527
If it's one thing I've
learned in 3000 years...

701
00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:01.981
it's you can't give up on family.

702
00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:10.784
Thanks again.

703
00:45:12.627 --> 00:45:14.209
He'll never make it.

704
00:45:15.087 --> 00:45:16.203
That's lunch!

705
00:45:25.348 --> 00:45:27.590
That's it.
That's Luke's yacht.

706
00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:29.349
What do we do? Swim?

707
00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:31.009
But it's water.

708
00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:33.679
Dad will help.

709
00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:38.683
Hey, Dad.

710
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:42.025
We're trying to save Camp Half-Blood
and rescue a satyr named Grover.

711
00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:45.653
And we could really use your help
getting to that ship out there.

712
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.402
Poseidon?

713
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.070
Dad?

714
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:51.739
It was a nice try, big guy...

715
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:54.666
but don't be upset when he doesn't...

716
00:46:01.259 --> 00:46:02.795
...answer.

717
00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:11.341
It's a hippocampus.

718
00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:24.855
Hi, girl.

719
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:27.945
Boy.

720
00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:32.491
Come here.

721
00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:39.540
Sometimes, you just gotta ask.

722
00:46:40.172 --> 00:46:42.630
All I've been doing is asking.

723
00:46:58.149 --> 00:46:59.390
Are you coming?

724
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:01.391
Yeah.

725
00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:06.358
Are you ready?

726
00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:07.693
Yeah.

727
00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:09.108
Giddy up!

728
00:48:13.641 --> 00:48:14.631
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

729
00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:16.929
Back up!

730
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.681
Back up.

731
00:48:29.156 --> 00:48:30.818
Thank you, friend.

732
00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:32.149
Tyson.

733
00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.067
Come on, buddy.
We gotta go.

734
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:38.321
Oh.

735
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:40.582
You want some sugar?

736
00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.051
- Have you seen it?
- No, man.

737
00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:53.094
Did he show it to you?

738
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.421
Wait until you see it.

739
00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:56.677
It took him long enough to find it.

740
00:48:59.145 --> 00:49:02.058
That's Chris Rodriguez, Ethan
Nakamura, and Silena Beauregard.

741
00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:03.764
Luke's been recruiting.

742
00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:05.599
Shh!

743
00:49:06.694 --> 00:49:08.526
This is a nice boat.

744
00:49:08.696 --> 00:49:10.608
How are we gonna find Grover?

745
00:49:11.365 --> 00:49:14.529
Luke is probably keeping him
below deck somewhere.

746
00:49:14.702 --> 00:49:16.068
Like, in a brig.

747
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:18.536
I don't think yachts have brigs, Percy.

748
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.497
Follow me.

749
00:49:26.172 --> 00:49:29.040
Be careful, you guys.
He said keep your distance.

750
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.213
How much longer are we
gonna be on this boat, anyway?

751
00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:34.215
Doesn't matter, just watch it.

752
00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:46.891
It's so time to go.

753
00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:49.396
Hey, Percy. Percy!

754
00:49:49.945 --> 00:49:50.935
Huh?

755
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:55.649
Tyson, do you have to make so much noise?

756
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.075
Sorry!

757
00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:14.626
Chris?

758
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.881
Hey.

759
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:18.179
What have you done with Grover?

760
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:22.760
Grover? Grover's
the least of your worries.

761
00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:25.729
<i>Guess who's here.</i>

762
00:50:34.907 --> 00:50:38.526
What a surprise. If it isn't
my two favorite cousins.

763
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:39.909
Three.

764
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.615
I'm a son of Poseidon, too.

765
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.329
That's funny, because Poseidon doesn't
have any other half-blood sons.

766
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.201
I'm a Cyclops.

767
00:50:50.798 --> 00:50:51.879
Mist.

768
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:53.711
You don't say.

769
00:50:57.638 --> 00:50:59.425
It's been a long time.

770
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.970
You look good.

771
00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.810
Where's Grover?

772
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.812
Grover, Grover.

773
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:10.224
Oh, Grover, yes.
Right, the satyr.

774
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:12.893
He should be in the Sea of
Monsters right about now.

775
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:16.606
I sent him on ahead with some friends.
We're kind of on the clock.

776
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:18.652
Wait, you're not...

777
00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:22.027
You're not just trying to stop
us from getting the Fleece.

778
00:51:22.121 --> 00:51:23.578
I need it, too.

779
00:51:25.124 --> 00:51:27.958
I got something only the Fleece can revive.

780
00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:29.993
And it's not a tree.

781
00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:33.463
Wanna see it?

782
00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:43.595
It wasn't easy to find. I had to crawl
through the depths of Tartarus itself.

783
00:51:44.476 --> 00:51:46.513
And then Cleveland.

784
00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:49.641
The remains of Kronos.

785
00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:52.853
The original Titan,
father to the Olympians.

786
00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:56.611
And with the Fleece's help,
destroyer of Olympus.

787
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.271
And the world.

788
00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:02.610
You'd destroy the whole world
just to get back at your dad?

789
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.703
The Olympians overthrew their parents.

790
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:07.822
It's just our turn.

791
00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.411
We met your father.

792
00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:12.836
He said that he knows
that he made mistakes.

793
00:52:13.005 --> 00:52:15.668
He told us to tell you to not be so angry.

794
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.040
Really?

795
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.211
And he couldn't even tell me himself.

796
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.596
Does that sound familiar?

797
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:26.766
Take them to the brig.

798
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:28.138
Let's go. Come on.

799
00:52:28.228 --> 00:52:31.392
Thalia was your friend! She
sacrificed herself for you.

800
00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:36.526
You're gonna lecture me about Thalia
when you're hanging around with him?

801
00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:40.405
You disappoint me the most.

802
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:18.273
I told you he had a brig.

803
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:25.150
How can you trust him?

804
00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:26.860
He was probably making all
that noise on purpose.

805
00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:28.786
He wanted Luke to catch us.

806
00:53:28.956 --> 00:53:31.198
What do you have against Tyson anyway?

807
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:32.953
He's a Cyclops.

808
00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:35.995
I think the politically correct
term is "ocularly impaired."

809
00:53:36.088 --> 00:53:38.876
Who cares? They're vicious
and they're dangerous.

810
00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:47.089
Yeah, vicious.

811
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:09.069
We have to get out of here.

812
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.657
How?

813
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.662
Just hang on to something.

814
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.490
All right, here we go.

815
00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:57.158
Come on, come on, come on!

816
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.043
Um...

817
00:55:07.179 --> 00:55:08.215
What's going on?

818
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:15.760
Percy's trying to kill us.

819
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.101
I think it's working.

820
00:55:31.537 --> 00:55:32.653
You got it?

821
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.867
Piece of cake.

822
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.077
I think I'm gonna vomit.

823
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:38.658
Yep.

824
00:55:40.295 --> 00:55:42.287
So, how does this work?

825
00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:46.128
I don't know. It's my
first mythical tape gun.

826
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:07.396
Just like Hermes said...

827
00:56:08.156 --> 00:56:09.237
"Instant hole."

828
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.015
Go to the lifeboat.

829
00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.982
Kill the engines.

830
00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:00.490
That was for Grover.

831
00:57:11.011 --> 00:57:12.502
Grab him!

832
00:57:36.203 --> 00:57:37.535
We got him!

833
00:57:46.088 --> 00:57:47.545
What are you doing?

834
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.713
Don't walk on my roof.

835
00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:57.217
Join me, Percy.

836
00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:58.882
It's what you were meant to do.

837
00:57:59.267 --> 00:58:01.054
You can't escape that prophecy.

838
00:58:01.979 --> 00:58:03.720
Let's show both of our fathers.

839
00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:05.975
It's tempting.

840
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:10.101
Oh...

841
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:12.945
That's genius. Really.

842
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:15.239
But I think I'll pass.

843
00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:33.583
Not this again.

844
00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:36.919
Go!

845
00:58:37.097 --> 00:58:38.304
Are you staying?

846
00:58:38.432 --> 00:58:39.422
I'll be right behind you.

847
00:58:43.854 --> 00:58:45.186
May as well.

848
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:21.301
Jackson, enough.

849
00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:28.138
You're on the losing side.

850
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:30.522
Not from where I stand.

851
00:59:39.284 --> 00:59:40.274
Oh!

852
00:59:48.543 --> 00:59:50.079
Smart.

853
00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:52.996
Goddess of wisdom's daughter, remember?

854
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.502
I remember.

855
01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:07.597
Our allies and the satyr still
have a head start on the Fleece.

856
01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.602
We will resurrect you, Lord Kronos.

857
01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.396
You will know vengeance.

858
01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:19.188
And the Olympians who
scorned us will know death.

859
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.714
Maybe you should reapply.

860
01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.430
It wore off?

861
01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:46.966
Yeah.

862
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.447
Come on.

863
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.575
Oh, no.

864
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.286
Hey.

865
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.244
Do you want to steer for a while?

866
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:17.755
Thank you.

867
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.709
Nobody's ever trusted me
with anything before.

868
01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.796
Is that because of your lack
of depth perception?

869
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.391
Is it because they're scared of you?

870
01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.472
I was in the mountains one day...

871
01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:40.233
and some campers, Boy Scouts, showed up.

872
01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:46.613
And when they saw me, they screamed.

873
01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:49.654
They ran.

874
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.707
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.

875
01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:59.376
People look at me, and they see a monster.

876
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.458
Sometimes, I think maybe they're right.

877
01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.719
You're not a monster.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

878
01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.635
Easy for you to say.

879
01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.144
What do you mean?

880
01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:17.599
You never doubt yourself or
think you're less than you are.

881
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.688
Thank you, brother.

882
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.942
Come here. Open it slowly.

883
01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.325
Slowly.

884
01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:34.157
Hey, just take it slow.
Slow, okay?

885
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:43.295
I wouldn't have trusted him
with a normal thermos.

886
01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:45.675
He seems okay.

887
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:48.679
I really don't get what
your problem with him is.

888
01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.350
Because you don't know
what I know about them.

889
01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:55.678
Thalia!

890
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.567
A Cyclops killed her.

891
01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:09.199
His kind killed Thalia.

892
01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.195
I'm sorry.

893
01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.114
I never knew.

894
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.875
Well, it's not something
I like talking about.

895
01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.621
And anyway, it was a long time ago.

896
01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:32.799
What is that?

897
01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.718
It's the Sea of Monsters.

898
01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.734
Why are we stopping?

899
01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.231
I should have used two hands.

900
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.692
You think?

901
01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:52.910
Are you mad at me?

902
01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.036
No, not at you.

903
01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:13.714
Tell me those aren't sharks.

904
01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:18.894
Those aren't sharks.

905
01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.935
Paddle! Paddle!

906
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.942
Yeah, sharks would be better.

907
01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.295
It's Charybdis.

908
01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:46.751
Charyb-... What?

909
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.833
She guards the Sea of Monsters.

910
01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:55.885
Percy!

911
01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:04.898
It's not working!

912
01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:08.857
The Sea of Monsters might not
be in Poseidon's domain.

913
01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.399
Hold on!

914
01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.193
Where are we?

915
01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:57.985
Smells like the stomach.

916
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.502
Watch your step.

917
01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.301
What is this stuff?

918
01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.424
I don't think you want to know.

919
01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:21.508
Whoa!

920
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.470
This has to be the worst way to die, ever.

921
01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:28.391
Yeah, everything that disappears
in the Bermuda Triangle...

922
01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:30.685
this is where they end up.

923
01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.020
Oh, come on!

924
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.447
That sounded like Clarisse.

925
01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.320
No, it couldn't be her.

926
01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:40.282
You ridiculously stupid morons.

927
01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:42.367
- No, it's her.
- It's her.

928
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.910
You idiot!

929
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:51.293
Better keep my electric grid up and
running, or I'll plug your head into it!

930
01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:53.294
Clarisse! Hey!

931
01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:59.179
Jackson? What are
you doing here?

932
01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.466
We got swallowed up, just like you.

933
01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:02.724
Nice ship.

934
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.928
My dad's got tons of this stuff left
over from wars throughout history.

935
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.763
It was either this or a Huey from Vietnam.

936
01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.019
I figured a boat would be more practical.

937
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.357
What's going on?

938
01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.940
Pretty much exactly what you think
goes on inside of a stomach.

939
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.496
You're right.

940
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.586
That really is the worst way to die.

941
01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:35.712
Reardon!

942
01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:38.260
What in Hades is going on with my engine?
Is it ready yet?

943
01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:41.259
Almost, ma'am.
They're working on it.

944
01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:44.049
Wait, your crew is zombies?

945
01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.307
They prefer "dead Confederate sailors whose
lives have been given in tribute to Ares."

946
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.858
But "zombies" is fine.

947
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:10.250
Reardon! Gun!
Faster! Now!

948
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.377
Gun is hot, Cap'n.
Locked and loaded.

949
01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.455
Aim it at that meat grinder.

950
01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.874
Wait, wait. You want to
shoot that thing with this?

951
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:20.132
Do you have a better idea?
Because now would be the time.

952
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.886
Hey, Clarisse.

953
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:26.679
What?

954
01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.094
Can you steer the ship?

955
01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:29.553
No. I just finished
driver's ed.

956
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.021
Yes, of course, I can steer a ship.

957
01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.518
Well...

958
01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.475
why don't we give her a stomach ache?

959
01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.481
We'll escape through the gut.

960
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:38.987
It just might work
if it doesn't kill us first.

961
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.406
You steer, I'll shoot.

962
01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:44.155
All hands below deck!

963
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:48.280
Good luck, Percy.

964
01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:57.711
All hands below deck. This is not a drill!
Come on, boys. Get in there.

965
01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.629
This is still my quest.

966
01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:05.923
Do not screw this up for me, Jackson.

967
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:20.937
Ah!

968
01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:27.615
You should watch what you eat.

969
01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:44.586
Go!

970
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.380
No kidding, genius.

971
01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.360
I hope this works.

972
01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:03.689
Just don't forget.

973
01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:04.941
Forget what?

974
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.490
This is all your idea.

975
01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:23.458
Whoa!

976
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.881
Come on, come on.

977
01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.859
- We did it!
- I did it!

978
01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.567
Listen up.
Full power to the screws.

979
01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.073
Hey, are you guys all right?

980
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.525
That was amazing.

981
01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.204
You have to have faith, right?

982
01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:55.783
And a cannon.
We'll find Grover.

983
01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.081
Where is Ichneutae?

984
01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.754
Oh, now you miss Ichneutae?

985
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.924
We ran into Scylla, that
multi-headed Hydra thing.

986
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.709
He said, "I got this."

987
01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:07.344
Famous last words.

988
01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.596
We've restored full power, Cap'n.

989
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.681
- Heading?
- Northwest.

990
01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.187
Are you sure about that?

991
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:24.611
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Why, do you have a problem?

992
01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:25.687
Yeah, you got a problem?

993
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:33.579
I think your Confederate warship is
heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.

994
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:35.697
What is it?

995
01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:39.414
I know this sounds insane, but
it's kind of like my dyslexia.

996
01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:43.797
But instead of being able to
read Greek, I can see map lines.

997
01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:47.717
30, 31, 75, 12.

998
01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.846
Wait, that's the numbers
from the--

999
01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:54.679
From the crazy, eyeless taxi drivers.

1000
01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:55.933
They're coordinates.

1001
01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.182
Ha! Waterboy figured it out.

1002
01:11:58.272 --> 01:11:59.433
And he called you crazy.

1003
01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:00.685
Actually, he called you crazy.

1004
01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:02.607
Hey, eye on the road.

1005
01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.235
30, 31 degrees north...

1006
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.897
75, 12 degrees west.

1007
01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:10.532
That's where Polyphemus and the Fleece are.

1008
01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.985
Change course. Southwest.

1009
01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.528
Aye, aye.

1010
01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:16.113
Sorry.

1011
01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:40.429
Land ho!

1012
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.856
Polyphemus lives in an amusement park?

1013
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.816
No, he lives on an island.

1014
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.075
But the goddess Circe thought building an
amusement park on top of it was a good idea.

1015
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.401
It really wasn't.

1016
01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:55.781
What happened?

1017
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.571
Opening day...

1018
01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:01.875
long lines of savory half-bloods
and one hungry Cyclops.

1019
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.081
Bad for business.

1020
01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.629
I'll just turn us right around then.

1021
01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.628
Find us a place to dock.

1022
01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.094
I was afraid she was gonna say that.

1023
01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.816
I guess the Cyclops was bad for business.

1024
01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:35.234
Who knew?

1025
01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.243
We don't have time
to search this whole place.

1026
01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.292
I don't think we have to.

1027
01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.914
"Plummet of Death"?

1028
01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.166
That's subtle.

1029
01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:55.007
It looks like something
really big went through there.

1030
01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:59.266
I don't know. It doesn't
really scream "Cyclops" to me.

1031
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.347
At least there's no line.

1032
01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.813
Sweet ride.

1033
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.279
Might need a push.

1034
01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:25.704
Here we go.

1035
01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.335
- Tyson? Let go of my hand.
- Sorry.

1036
01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:37.463
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1037
01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.099
<i>- It's a small world after all
- It's a small world after all</i>

1038
01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:43.635
Could you two just shut up?

1039
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:48.723
Hold on!

1040
01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.569
Is everybody okay?

1041
01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.738
I thought that would be more fun.

1042
01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:03.030
I think I get what
Grover was so worried about.

1043
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.000
This must be the boulder Polyphemus
used to trap Odysseus...

1044
01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:09.624
when he was returning from the Trojan War.

1045
01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:12.422
Yeah, that's right.
I know stuff.

1046
01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.598
Grover!

1047
01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.401
Enough!

1048
01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:37.189
I can't take this anymore!

1049
01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:46.910
It's been two days!

1050
01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:49.368
Calm your temper!
Calm your temper!

1051
01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:53.831
I haven't had a decent meal since
those half-bloods you brought!

1052
01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.751
And this stupid fleece
is supposed to lure satyrs!

1053
01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.585
Do you see any satyrs around here?

1054
01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:03.306
This hunger is making my eyesight worse.

1055
01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.217
I could just eat you.

1056
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:10.306
If you weren't a Cyclops.

1057
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.058
Grover!

1058
01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.810
Grover!

1059
01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.403
- Hey!
- Come here!

1060
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.731
Percy?

1061
01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.025
Hey!

1062
01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.654
Why are you wearing a dress?

1063
01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.035
I'm having a really bad day!

1064
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.576
Hey, hey, hey!
Do not let that go viral!

1065
01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:33.166
Sorry, there's no way the other
kids would believe me otherwise.

1066
01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.666
This is a disguise.

1067
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:37.340
The guy's half-blind. He thinks
I'm a Cyclops chambermaid.

1068
01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:38.962
I'm showing mad survival skills, here.

1069
01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:40.464
And not a small amount of leg.

1070
01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:41.544
Funny.

1071
01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:45.098
I was trying to stay uneaten long enough to
figure out how to get the Fleece off of him.

1072
01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.595
So, did you?

1073
01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:49.678
Do you think I'd still be
dressed like this if I did?

1074
01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.434
It's a good look.

1075
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:52.643
Thanks, Tyson.

1076
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:59.856
Clopsies, how about I cook
you something to drink...

1077
01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.898
to calm your nerves?

1078
01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.036
I don't know what to do anymore.

1079
01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:08.204
Go! Go!

1080
01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:11.117
This fleece used to lure satyrs every day.

1081
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.200
Huh?

1082
01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:17.707
Now things are so bad, I even
had to eat my own sheep.

1083
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:19.924
The whole flock!

1084
01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:22.836
They were tender, though.

1085
01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.390
Drop me, and I promise you'll
never hear the end of it.

1086
01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:34.640
Do you smell something?
Smells like half-bloods!

1087
01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:40.812
Half-bloods!

1088
01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.693
- Get up, quick!
- I was right!

1089
01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.319
You stay right there!

1090
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.072
Woman, get a fire going!

1091
01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:47.531
That's not good!

1092
01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:49.078
On second thought...

1093
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:51.702
I'll just eat you raw!

1094
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:52.782
Hey!

1095
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.200
Huh.

1096
01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.662
Hiya!

1097
01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.330
My name's Tyson.
How are you?

1098
01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:00.923
These guys are my friends...

1099
01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.009
so I was hoping, maybe, we could talk.

1100
01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.508
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

1101
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.593
You pissant with one eye!

1102
01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:09.302
Hey! Not nice!

1103
01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:13.766
You're no Cyclops!
You're a traitor to your kind!

1104
01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:14.929
To be honest...

1105
01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:17.603
Huh? What?

1106
01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.601
He's my kind.

1107
01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.770
You disgust me.

1108
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:28.527
Going somewhere?

1109
01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:35.666
I think you've got something of mine.

1110
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:37.836
Annabeth!

1111
01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.457
Oh!

1112
01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.460
Clarisse!

1113
01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.019
Get back here, you punk!

1114
01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.649
Yo, Clopsies!

1115
01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.402
I quit!

1116
01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:06.573
Wait, you're a dude?

1117
01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.278
Well, that explains a lot.

1118
01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:11.319
- Say goodbye.
- Okay. Goodbye!

1119
01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.706
You deceitful little brats!
I'll tear off your flesh!

1120
01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.329
Come on! Go, go!

1121
01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.494
Give me that fleece!

1122
01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.175
You're dead!

1123
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.848
I'm gonna kill all of you!

1124
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.183
Do you hear me?

1125
01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.268
Get back here!

1126
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:46.942
We rocked that quest.

1127
01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.694
Yeah, we totally did.

1128
01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:51.154
I didn't know you guys had it in you!

1129
01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.534
Yes.

1130
01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.241
Well done.

1131
01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.205
It's nice work.
I really appreciate it.

1132
01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:03.208
I'll take that.

1133
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.502
I don't think so.

1134
01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:11.212
Suit yourself.

1135
01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:30.406
You'd do it for me.

1136
01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.193
No!

1137
01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:59.303
Just remember...

1138
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.517
it didn't have to end this way.

1139
01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.724
This one's on you.

1140
01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:12.857
Down, boy!

1141
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.117
You should consider yourselves lucky.

1142
01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.044
This has been millennia in the making.

1143
01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:27.626
And you all get to see it.

1144
01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:30.250
You used to be one of us!

1145
01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.716
And then I woke up.

1146
01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:42.062
Percy, if Kronos comes back, that's it.
Game over.

1147
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:45.477
Percy.

1148
01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:48.939
I never called him "brother."

1149
01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:53.361
All he ever wanted was a brother...

1150
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.277
but I was too wrapped up in myself.

1151
01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.827
And now Luke has the Fleece...

1152
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.162
because I gave it to him.

1153
01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:10.082
I destroy Olympus,
just like the Oracle said.

1154
01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.505
Forget the Oracle.

1155
01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:18.257
You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.

1156
01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.096
You're angry at Poseidon for ignoring you?

1157
01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:23.098
Then show him why he shouldn't.

1158
01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.848
You're upset about Tyson?

1159
01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.435
Then make sure he didn't die for nothing.

1160
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.235
She's right.

1161
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.901
What?

1162
01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:37.818
There's no way you're
getting me to repeat that.

1163
01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:41.366
What Annabeth is saying, Perce...

1164
01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.744
is that we're with you.

1165
01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.658
Just give the word.

1166
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:47.455
Why me?

1167
01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.878
I mean, who voted me leader?

1168
01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:07.564
Lord Kronos, he who was
betrayed by his sons...

1169
01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:10.646
hear now the words of one
betrayed by his father.

1170
01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:13.436
I bid you... rise.

1171
01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:52.892
Grover!

1172
01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:55.937
Hands.

1173
01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:59.649
Try not to cut them off.
I'm pretty attached to them.

1174
01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.966
I have to get to the Fleece.

1175
01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:23.131
So, what are we supposed to do?

1176
01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:26.468
Right.

1177
01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:57.586
I know you can breathe
under water, Jackson.

1178
01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.508
But can you breathe like this?

1179
01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:10.845
Hi, Brother!

1180
01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:25.864
What the--?

1181
01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.161
The water.

1182
01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:30.122
It healed me.

1183
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.076
Son of Poseidon.

1184
01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.253
Thank you...

1185
01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:43.339
Brother.

1186
01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.661
He rises.

1187
01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:27.258
Master!

1188
01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:29.094
I brought you back!

1189
01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.980
My Lord!

1190
01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:41.269
It's Luke!

1191
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:46.150
Luke Castellan!
Your great-grandson!

1192
01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:48.985
My favorite.

1193
01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:33.362
Whoa!

1194
01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:36.995
Grover!

1195
01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:14.324
It's the cursed blade!

1196
01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.865
"...cursed blade shall reap."

1197
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:47.562
You want to know who gave me this sword?

1198
01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:51.653
The god that killed you
with it in the first place!

1199
01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:56.245
My father.

1200
01:28:57.415 --> 01:28:58.997
Percy Jackson...

1201
01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.784
your destiny was written long ago.

1202
01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:05.246
No!

1203
01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.588
I make my own destiny.

1204
01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.210
Half-blood!

1205
01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.714
Just in time for dinner.

1206
01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:17.701
Thanks, Dad.

1207
01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.664
Percy.

1208
01:30:29.382 --> 01:30:30.748
Annabeth!

1209
01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:35.127
Grover!

1210
01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.781
Annabeth!

1211
01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:03.868
No, no!

1212
01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.872
At least I'll be with Thalia in Elysium.

1213
01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.207
Come here.
Give me the Fleece!

1214
01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:10.830
Come on! Come on.

1215
01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:11.956
Come on.

1216
01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:18.049
We make our own destinies, right?
So show me.

1217
01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:19.384
I have faith in you.

1218
01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:26.137
No, no.
Come on, show me.

1219
01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:28.306
Show me.

1220
01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.275
Come on.

1221
01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.019
Annie.

1222
01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:14.860
What happened?

1223
01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:16.729
Don't worry about it.

1224
01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:19.281
If anyone else wants to die tonight...

1225
01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:21.488
at least we have this.

1226
01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:25.488
Hey. You're alive.

1227
01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:27.789
Yeah.

1228
01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:30.834
What you did for Percy...

1229
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.667
that was not so vicious and dangerous.

1230
01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:38.459
Thanks.

1231
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.210
No.

1232
01:32:40.847 --> 01:32:42.133
Thank you.

1233
01:32:53.359 --> 01:32:54.349
You know what, Tyson?

1234
01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:57.107
I know a lot of campers with two
eyes who couldn't do what you did.

1235
01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:59.280
- Hey, Clarisse.
- What?

1236
01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:01.862
Come on, big guy. We get back
to camp, the nectar's on me.

1237
01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:03.658
Have you met the nymphs?

1238
01:33:04.329 --> 01:33:05.820
This was your quest.

1239
01:33:06.873 --> 01:33:10.492
I couldn't have done it without you.

1240
01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:12.910
I think you should
be the one who gets to...

1241
01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:14.666
...do the honors.

1242
01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:33.139
Here you go, Thalia.

1243
01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:49.598
Clarisse!
Clarisse! Clarisse!

1244
01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:56.517
Nectar?

1245
01:34:58.484 --> 01:34:59.520
If you haven't had...

1246
01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:00.772
...you haven't lived.

1247
01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:07.612
You know what?

1248
01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:11.036
You don't need these anymore.

1249
01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:14.160
There, that's better.

1250
01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:29.967
<i>You seem happy.</i>

1251
01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:34.219
I'm just relieved to have that whole
prophecy thing off my shoulders.

1252
01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:37.012
I'm not altogether sure it is, Percy.

1253
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:41.309
You've done wonderfully, but you are
still the only living human child...

1254
01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:43.773
of Poseidon, Hades, or Zeus.

1255
01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:45.358
Besides...

1256
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:50.617
it's quite possible the Oracle wasn't referring
to what would unfold on Polyphemus' island.

1257
01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:53.700
I'm just saying, a lot can happen
between now and your 20th birthday.

1258
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.782
That's not really what I meant.

1259
01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:59.539
What I meant was finding
out you have a destiny...

1260
01:35:59.712 --> 01:36:03.331
is a lot like finding out you have
a half-brother who's a Cyclops.

1261
01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:05.962
It might not be as bad as you think.

1262
01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:21.519
Percy! Percy!

1263
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:23.942
Percy!

1264
01:36:24.279 --> 01:36:27.067
Annabeth was guarding
the tree last night...

1265
01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.856
and something happened.

1266
01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:32.116
Percy.

1267
01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:34.366
- The Fleece!
- What happened?

1268
01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:37.038
It was even more powerful than we thought.

1269
01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:58.139
Come on, help her.

1270
01:36:59.939 --> 01:37:01.146
Who are you?

1271
01:37:02.108 --> 01:37:04.475
Percy. Everything's
all right, it's okay.

1272
01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:06.313
I had the strangest dream.

1273
01:37:06.404 --> 01:37:07.394
Yeah?

1274
01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:09.400
Like I was dying.

1275
01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:11.107
What's your name?

1276
01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:15.407
I'm Thalia, daughter of Zeus.

1277
01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:21.075
<i>Another living child of the eldest gods.</i>

1278
01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.163
<i>Maybe it wasn't me.</i>

1279
01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:29.175
<i>Maybe the Oracle meant Thalia all along.</i>

1280
01:37:30.595 --> 01:37:32.962
<i>Could she be our salvation?</i>

1281
01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:35.761
<i>Or the cause of our destruction?</i>
