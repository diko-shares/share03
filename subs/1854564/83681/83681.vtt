1
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,710
In the year 1582...

2
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:48,290
When Oda Nobunaga got close to his dream of unifying the governmental power, he got assassinated because of a treason of his vassal Akechi Mitsuhide.

3
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:58,620
But Nobunaga's right-hand man, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, suppressed Mitsuhide. As Nobunaga's successor, he established the Toyotomi Administration.

4
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,400
While the sparks were still glowing, he already glorified that temporary peace.

5
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,200
You Idiot!

6
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,730
Open the gate!

7
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,710
You're Kinokuniya Bunzaemon, right?

8
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,580
Yes...

9
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,720
As Taiko Hideyoshi has ordered...

10
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,430
we've come to confiscate the thing the traitor Akechi Mitsuhide had entrusted you with.

11
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,260
Give it to us right now!

12
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,600
So...

13
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,280
it would be better to ask Akechi himself.

14
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,280
We don't remember that he had entrusted us with something.

15
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,290
Lead me to the depository!

16
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,930
I want to see for myself whether it's there or not.

17
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,440
Huh?

18
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,410
What?

19
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,390
A thief...

20
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,660
We have been stolen!

21
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,960
Well...

22
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,570
Is it this way round or the other way round?

23
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,730
Yes.

24
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,820
And if I pass through here, I'll find a loophole...

25
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,820
What?

26
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,480
There he is!

27
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,020
Capture him!

28
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,100
Didn't that Sasuke guy tell me something completely different?

29
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,290
Take this!

30
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,730
Take this!

31
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,860
Oh...

32
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,570
Just kidding!

33
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,870
You want to steal something from a government official like me?

34
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,340
That's not a good idea, or is it?

35
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,350
Ah?

36
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,320
It's Goemon!

37
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,560
What? Where?

38
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,490
There, there, look!

39
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,570
Oh...

40
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,040
What a superb view!

41
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,900
That's...

42
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,700
Yes.

43
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,540
The great master thief...

44
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,540
Ishikawa Goemon, ally of the poor!

45
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,910
Rejoice!

46
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,350
Here!

47
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,410
Ouch!

48
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,960
Hey!

49
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,060
Ah!

50
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,450
Hey, hey!

51
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,960
Out of the way!

52
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,900
What?

53
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,560
What? It's empty!

54
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,220
We'll have a party tonight!

55
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,320
You there, come down! We need to arrest you!

56
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,420
If you tell me that, I won't come down for sure, you idiots!

57
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,730
What?

58
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

59
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,670
Good bye!

60
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,110
I'm Goemon.

61
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,120
Japan's number one!

62
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,550
Hey, Ishikawa...

63
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,280
What?

64
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,490
Shall I accompany you tonight, too?

65
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,030
What? That would be nice, but...

66
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,720
I don't have any money left.

67
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,790
I don't care at all!

68
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,860
If you'd like, I'll pay for everything here.

69
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,310
You're saying such nice things to me.

70
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,740
Goemon!

71
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,640
Oh...

72
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,020
Oh, I wanted to meet you!

73
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,650
Hey, Goemon, it's my turn tonight, right?

74
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,220
You don't like that piss-smelling girl, or do you?

75
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,220
What?

76
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,180
It's obvious that he likes me more than someone like you!

77
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,660
You're both good!

78
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,540
What are you looking at?

79
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,540
Yes!

80
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,910
Shall we dance?

81
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,380
It's gone.

82
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,450
That thief really...

83
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,220
Saizou.

84
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,630
Who is that guy?

85
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,240
The one who caused that disturbance in the town was just a normal thief.

86
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,540
That guy has taken the box.

87
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,940
Bring it back, no matter what it takes!

88
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,710
Yes.

89
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,750
Also...

90
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,050
Kill all members of his family!

91
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,920
You understand, don't you?

92
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,760
Women, children, don't let even a single person alive.

93
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,000
Tomorrow morning I'll to to Hideyoshi.

94
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,890
He absolutely must not get to know what happened to the box.

95
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,230
Understood?

96
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
Sasuke.

97
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,140
Towel.

98
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,770
What?

99
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,070
When did you realize that?

100
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,210
Just now.

101
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,280
Hey, come on, just give it to me!

102
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,580
Ah, yes, yes.

103
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,110
You're treating people really rough...

104
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:41,990
Here.

105
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,890
Ouch...!

106
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,260
Hey, what are you doing, master?

107
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,090
Isn't it obvious, fool?

108
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,760
What do you mean?

109
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,990
Don't give me that!

110
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,770
This drawing...

111
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,770
Isn't it totally wrong?

112
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,940
Because of that, I was in real trouble yesterday!

113
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,840
Oh?

114
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,110
Really?

115
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,980
It's your share from yesterday.

116
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,780
Thank you very much!

117
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,750
By the way:

118
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,150
Are you still after me?

119
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,850
No way...!

120
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,020
I thought, you were just a simple ronin back then, master...

121
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,790
And I would just hurt myself if I'd do that.

122
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,330
Also...

123
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,800
Being close to you, master...

124
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,200
is much more profitable...

125
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,200
Profitable, huh?

126
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,110
By the way, about that mansion yesterday...

127
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,670
It seems it wasn't a normal mansion.

128
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,810
Toyotomi Hideyoshi's magistrate, Mitsunari,...

129
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,280
went there to confiscate something, it seems.

130
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,940
Something like a... box of the southern barbarians...

131
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,850
But it wasn't there anymore...

132
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,960
Those guys are searching for it all around the city!

133
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,890
That box of the southern barbarians...

134
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,990
Is it this tall?

135
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,060
Probably...

136
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,190
Is it indigo blue?

137
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,060
What?

138
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,190
I've stolen it.

139
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:00,960
After all!

140
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,970
By the way, why didn't you tell me earlier?

141
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,330
I didn't know that it was there, too.

142
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,570
So... where's the box now?

143
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,910
I've thrown it away.

144
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,540
Thank goodness...

145
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,910
Anyway, they've killed all employers, family members...

146
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,810
and even all servants of that mansion!

147
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,980
How cruel!

148
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,820
Sounds interesting.

149
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,190
What?

150
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,030
OK, I go.

151
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm going to find that box.

152
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,090
That's a bad idea, master.

153
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,190
It seems, that Mitsunari has sent out Saizou.

154
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,260
The mysterious Saizou...

155
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,900
I haven't heard that name before!

156
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,170
He's the most famous shinobi in this world!

157
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,340
He's extremely talented...

158
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,010
So we shouldn't get involved with this!

159
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,110
Right?

160
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,750
I go.

161
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,390
Yes...

162
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,050
Damn...

163
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,430
How is it?

164
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,410
We've received some presents from the Christians...

165
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,040
This seems to be a box that can play music.

166
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,080
They keep producing...

167
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,450
one interesting thing after another.

168
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,590
Mitsunari.

169
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,900
You seem to be quite busy lately.

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,730
Yes.

171
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,130
It's all for your sake, Taiko.

172
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,240
For my sake?

173
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,750
You... what are you searching for?

174
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,950
I don't know what you're talking about.

175
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,420
Don't play dumb!

176
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,960
It's the box, right?

177
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,960
The southern barbarian's...

178
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,660
Ah, yes, yes, Ishikawa?

179
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,530
That person was here yesterday.

180
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,980
Really?

181
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,100
Hey, Yashichi.

182
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,110
I'm thirsty, so bring me some water!

183
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,310
Ah, yes, I'll come...

184
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,010
What?

185
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,480
A warning?

186
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,650
Yes.

187
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,990
Trading of goods from the southern barbarians is strictly prohibited.

188
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,720
If we ignore it, I'm afraid that your authority might get soiled.

189
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
I will proceed on my own.

190
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,330
I've acted selfish.

191
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,170
You're one of my personally nominated magistrates.

192
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,500
And you've acted too selfish.

193
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,540
If you carry this too far...

194
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,080
All hail! Miss Chacha has arrived from the north.

195
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,550
Ah, she's already here?

196
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,230
You've really helped me, Ishida.

197
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,530
Tokugawa...

198
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,580
What do you mean by that?

199
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,550
I had an audience with Chacha earlier.

200
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:43,080
I haven't seen her for a long time, but she has become very beautiful.

201
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,390
It's understandable that Hideyoshi wants her.

202
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,560
Chacha is Nobunaga's niece.

203
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,570
His best vassal, Hideyoshi,...

204
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,070
treats her like his own daughter.

205
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,210
But is that...

206
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,410
really all?

207
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,880
Then...

208
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,490
Chacha.

209
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,230
How many years have passed...

210
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,590
since Nobunaga has died...

211
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,000
and I've become your foster parent?

212
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,600
It's been 15 years ago.

213
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,600
I don't know how I should thank you for all you've done for me.

214
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,240
What are you saying?

215
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,580
I'm just doing what I have to do.

216
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,400
If he wouldn't have employed me...

217
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,110
I would've died as a wretched peasant.

218
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,120
That's why I've become...

219
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,420
the one with the governmental power...

220
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,630
as a Taiko.

221
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,160
The world has changed.

222
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,110
You need to change, too, Chacha.

223
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,140
Become my concubine!

224
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,280
And after you've become my concubine, will you give birth to my child?

225
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,150
A child who's descended from Nobunaga...

226
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,690
Yes?

227
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,320
Who is it?

228
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,660
It's me, Rikyu.

229
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,140
Ah, you are here... Hideyoshi.

230
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,360
I'll come back later.

231
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,510
It's fine, I was about to leave.

232
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,210
Rikyu.

233
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes.

234
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,340
Chacha will be staying in this castle for a while.

235
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,320
I'm waiting for your answer.

236
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,530
Long time no see, Chacha.

237
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,330
You must be exhausted from the long journey.

238
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,500
Shall we hold a tea ceremony?

239
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,200
Rikyu...

240
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,210
Yes.

241
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,350
Will I...

242
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,220
be able to see the fireflies even from here?

243
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,630
Please wait, master.

244
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,230
How are we supposed to find that thing here?

245
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,430
Intuition, I guess.

246
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,430
Sigh.

247
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,300
I was expecting that answer.

248
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,580
Here, mother, eat.

249
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,050
Koheita, this...

250
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,750
What? Do you think I've stolen it?

251
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,210
Goemon came out yesterday.

252
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,490
Koheita?

253
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,420
I've already eaten, so it's OK.

254
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,260
Here, eat.

255
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,760
Thanks.

256
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,410
Delicious.

257
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,650
Mother, are you all right?

258
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,610
Wait here, I'll buy some medicine.

259
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,920
Hi.

260
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,660
Ugh, it stinks here.

261
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,300
These are the worst slums I've ever seen!

262
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,660
Because of the free Market, free Guild policy, new markets have been opened...

263
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,500
Good for the people who were successful with them.

264
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,800
But all the weak guys ended up like this.

265
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,810
And the disparity between the rich and the poor became even wider.

266
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,780
They just think about the survival of the fittest, I guess.

267
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,320
I don't know whether this is good or bad.

268
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,450
Hey, master...

269
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,390
Fine, fine, fine...

270
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,620
Hey, hey, hey...

271
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,360
You don't feel like searching anymore, do you, master?

272
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,490
That's not true!

273
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,560
Mother!

274
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,200
Is this all right?

275
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,340
Absolutely!

276
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,640
Those guys are rotten to the bone, right?

277
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,520
What do you want?

278
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,350
If you don't want your head to be cut off by this proud sword, you should leave immediately.

279
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,540
Aniki! Aniki!

280
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,740
Master!

281
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,510
My arm!

282
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,510
That was too much, master!

283
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,910
Mother...

284
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,520
Mother, why...

285
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,790
Why...

286
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,730
It's because you're weak.

287
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,400
That's what you're thinking, right?

288
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,070
"I couldn't beat them, so she got killed".

289
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,370
"If I had been stronger than they are, all of that wouldn't have happened".

290
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,870
Am I wrong?

291
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,080
Become strong, boy!

292
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,640
If you do that, they won't be able to take away anything from you ever again.

293
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,890
I'll take this box.

294
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
Yes.

295
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,930
Since we've got the box, let's go back, master!

296
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,460
It's already too late.

297
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,560
What?

298
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,130
Who's that?

299
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,760
Saizou...

300
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,460
What?

301
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,140
Goemon.

302
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,580
Give me that box.

303
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,480
And what if I say that I don't want to?

304
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,020
You really shouldn't try that.

305
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,340
Master! Master!

306
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,800
It was just a joke, a joke!

307
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,970
Understood.

308
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,170
Here, take it!

309
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,990
Bye.

310
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,890
Follow them!

311
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,870
That's dangerous!

312
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,580
Here I am!

313
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,050
Hey, let me through, let me through!

314
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,560
Master!

315
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,560
Go!

316
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,220
You haven't gotten rusty yet, have you?

317
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,710
You're quite motivated, huh?

318
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,730
Just what's so special about that box?

319
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,910
It's called Pandora's Box.

320
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,080
What's that?

321
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,110
There's a legend about it in the west.

322
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,080
You mustn't open it.

323
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,320
It's a box that summons many different calamities when you open it.

324
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,120
Do it!

325
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,260
Do you still want the box?

326
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,500
The circumstances have changed.

327
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,770
You've just barely escaped being killed.

328
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,290
Master... are you all right?

329
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,330
Delicious!

330
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,170
If you don't wanna eat that, I'll take it.

331
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,570
Wait a second...

332
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,070
Master.

333
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,060
Do you really want to take him with you?

334
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:48,800
Is there a problem with it?

335
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,340
Isn't he just a burden for us?!

336
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,570
Is god...

337
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,380
testing our abilities with this task?

338
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,520
Just what the hell can that damned brat do for us?

339
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,910
Nothing, but...

340
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,890
I don't care whether I have one or two burdens to carry.

341
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,860
Even if you say that...

342
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,860
What?

343
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,930
You see me as a burden, too?

344
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,590
I've had enough.

345
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,560
Then...

346
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,830
What's that box?

347
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,570
It's called something with pan.

348
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,370
I see...

349
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,280
By the way, master...

350
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:24,900
What?

351
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,170
Do you know Saizou?

352
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:28,780
Why?

353
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,280
I'm just wondering.

354
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,280
We're just both famous.

355
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,080
Don't lie to me!

356
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:35,940
Do you want to know?

357
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,920
Yes.

358
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,420
You haven't told me anything about your past at all, master.

359
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,750
I had my first time at 15.

360
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,590
That's not what I wanted to know!

361
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,050
I'm just a normal thief...

362
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,930
The great master thief, Ishikawa Goemon.

363
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,260
That's all to know...

364
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,030
What's this?

365
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,400
What?

366
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
Looks like a map...

367
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,140
Oh!

368
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,910
What's wrong with you? Why are you so loud?

369
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,710
Here.

370
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,780
Thanks for the food!

371
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,320
Yes!

372
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,490
Hey, let's go!

373
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,730
Thanks for the food...

374
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,430
The payment.

375
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,680
Here...

376
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,810
It's here, right?

377
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,080
There.

378
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,190
It's inside of his ear.

379
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,710
Yes!

380
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,050
Ah!

381
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,280
There's something.

382
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,490
Ah! It hurts, it hurts!

383
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,960
I'm stuck!

384
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,790
Ah, ouch, ouch!

385
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,670
Master, please help me, master.

386
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,060
Master, please look here!

387
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,130
What's that?

388
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,230
Hey, master!

389
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,480
It hurts...

390
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,860
A jointly sealed covenant?

391
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:53,860
Huh?

392
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,420
I've seen these family crests somewhere before...

393
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,260
Come out!

394
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,860
You keep following us since that inn...

395
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,700
Right!

396
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,610
I knew the whole time you were there!

397
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,850
Who the hell are you?

398
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,420
Hattori Hanzou...

399
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,340
What?

400
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,390
Well... oh... Hattori Hanzou?

401
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,890
I give that back to you.

402
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,890
Who's that?

403
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,430
No one knows...

404
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,970
There's no one who's seen him and survived it.

405
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,710
Damn, it's the legendary shinobi!

406
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,100
What do you want?

407
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,640
I want to buy that jointly sealed covenant.

408
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,250
If that's not enough, I'll give you more.

409
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,120
You... you can't buy it with that small amount of money!

410
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,620
Understood, I'll sell it to you.

411
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,560
Right, right...

412
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,390
What?

413
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,160
You really want to sell it?

414
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,310
If you don't have an employment, I know a good employer!

415
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,430
I've got enough money to survive.

416
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,510
Hey.

417
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,250
Is this thing real?

418
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,750
What? Hanzou?

419
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,160
Perhaps... Ieyasu ordered it...

420
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,330
That damned cunning old man!

421
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,790
He knew about the jointly sealed covenant?

422
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,160
If Goemon gave him the box... then...

423
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,540
Damn!

424
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,650
That thing was our special trump card...

425
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,210
Just who the hell is that Goemon guy?!

426
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,350
Oh, why that grim face?

427
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,960
Can't you wait just a little bit longer?

428
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,460
Till we get our hands on that jointly sealed covenant...

429
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,400
And when we finally have it...

430
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,830
What?

431
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:26,140
Just where have I seen those family crests before...?

432
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,540
Where was it?

433
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,410
What?

434
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,410
What?

435
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:39,880
Hey, brat!

436
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,530
Have you seen my Kodachi?

437
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,890
I don't know where that dirty thing is...

438
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,330
It's not dirty.

439
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,560
Hey, where's Goemon?

440
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,170
Oh? Well...

441
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,700
He's sleeping, strangely.

442
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,540
You should also sleep, brat.

443
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,340
Damned brat.

444
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,930
Do you have it?

445
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,620
Kneel down!

446
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,740
I've remembered!

447
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,480
What?

448
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,340
Those were...

449
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,180
the family crests of the Akechi and Hashiba families!

450
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,010
Those family crests on that jointly sealed covenant!

451
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,360
Akechi? Hashi?

452
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,490
Yes, Akechi is...

453
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,460
Akechi Mitsuhide...

454
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,160
15 years ago, after the unification of the country, he got close to Nobunaga and then betrayed him...

455
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,600
He's the man who assassinated him in the Honno temple.

456
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,800
And Hashiba?

457
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,500
Hashiba stands for Hashiba Hideyoshi...

458
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,610
It's Toyotomi Hideyoshi's former name.

459
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,350
No way...

460
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:48,050
So Hideyoshi and Mitsuhide had a secret connection after all...

461
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,520
What does that mean?

462
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,390
That means...

463
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,160
It was Taiko Hideyoshi himself...

464
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,820
who planned Nobunaga's assassination.

465
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,170
This jointly sealed covenant is...

466
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,540
the absolute proof of it.

467
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,470
So... has he made a move?

468
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,300
Probably.

469
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,170
Master! Master!

470
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,710
It's not the time for sleeping!

471
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,580
Ma...

472
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,320
Wh... who are you?

473
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,190
This is my revenge...

474
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,090
for Nobunaga!

475
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:37,890
I...

476
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,110
What happened?

477
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,400
Who are you?

478
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,720
Goemon...

479
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,220
Chacha...

480
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,690
Chacha!

481
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,840
Old lady.

482
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,680
It's dangerous to walk around in this area late at night.

483
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,580
Rumors say that bandits might come out.

484
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,950
I'm begging you!

485
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,780
Just spare this child, please, just spare this child!

486
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,180
I'm begging you!

487
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,960
This isn't a path an old hag like you should take!

488
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,130
On the other hand...

489
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,200
You have quite a cute face, huh?

490
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,140
I'll sell you at a high price.

491
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,490
You brat...

492
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,130
Boy.

493
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,160
Become strong!

494
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,770
If you do that, they won't be able to take away anything from you ever again.

495
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,840
Do you want to come with me?

496
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,980
I'll make you strong!

497
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,490
Welcome back, Nobunaga.

498
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,420
Ah...

499
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,920
Nobunaga, who's that brat?

500
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,220
I'll look after him from today on.

501
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,400
What?

502
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:42,930
Hanzou!

503
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,040
We have a new shinobi.

504
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,300
What's his name?

505
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,300
Goemon.

506
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,040
OK?

507
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,170
Goemon, Saizou...

508
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,250
The winner is allowed to drink.

509
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,190
<i>A shinobi is like a shadow.</i>

510
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,320
<i>A shadow doesn't need it's self.</i>

511
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,990
<i>Kill your self and become your master's blade.</i>

512
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,940
<i>Never show yourself and hide from this world.</i>

513
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,550
<i>That... is the destiny of a shinobi.</i>

514
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,060
That's enough, stop!

515
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,000
These two are now excellent adepts.

516
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,580
So, my eyes weren't deceived?

517
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:40,680
Goemon!

518
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:41,510
Ahh!

519
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,980
Goemon...

520
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,480
You mustn't get up yet!

521
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,430
Here.

522
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,700
Ah, delicious.

523
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,770
Here's today's tile block print.

524
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,380
It says, someone killed Taiko Hideyoshi's double.

525
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,680
It happened in that night, when you...

526
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,210
disappeared together with my Kodachi and came back injured.

527
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,950
Just who the hell are you?

528
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,690
The great master thief...

529
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,520
Do you still call yourself this way?!

530
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,190
Oda Nobunaga's first shinobi...

531
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,230
is now a thief?

532
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,600
He has brought you here.

533
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,640
That wasn't necessary.

534
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,270
Mitsunari!

535
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,950
Whose job is it to defend the castle?

536
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,280
It's my job!

537
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,060
Because I had entrusted this castle to you good-for-nothing...

538
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,090
I almost got killed!

539
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,050
Do you...

540
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,400
want me...

541
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,660
to die?

542
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,300
Not at all!

543
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,980
Really?

544
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:23,280
Is it too bitter?

545
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,420
Oh...

546
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:33,360
This is... a very beautiful folding fan.

547
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,340
Have you...

548
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,440
met someone, whom you...

549
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,880
missed for a long time?

550
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,770
Rikyu...

551
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:48,780
Yes.

552
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,670
Why do you...

553
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,310
stay at Hideyoshi's side?

554
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,620
When I was holding...

555
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,060
a tea ceremony for Hideyoshi and all the other feudal lords...

556
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,200
I could hear his voice.

557
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,500
His voice?

558
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,530
Yes.

559
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,870
The voice of the person who will change this world.

560
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,080
The one who taught me that...

561
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:24,710
was Nobunaga.

562
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,400
Goemon!

563
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:50,270
Yes.

564
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,040
This is my niece Chacha.

565
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,580
She will live in this castle from today on.

566
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,750
Protect her!

567
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,550
Father...

568
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,120
Mother...

569
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,920
Don't go...

570
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,790
Father...

571
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,710
Goemon...

572
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,940
Goemon!

573
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,350
I'm here.

574
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,280
I had a scary dream.

575
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,360
I'm right here, so...

576
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,620
Don't worry. Sleep on.

577
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,150
Goemon?

578
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,130
Yes.

579
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,120
Where are your parents, Goemon?

580
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,200
I don't have any.

581
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,830
I see...

582
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,070
Well, just like me.

583
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,050
My father also died during the war.

584
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,910
Even now...

585
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,520
I'm having dreams of that time.

586
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,580
Over and over again.

587
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,520
And friends?

588
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,350
Do you have any friends?

589
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,100
Yes.

590
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,390
But only one.

591
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,730
What's his name?

592
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,110
His name is Saizou.

593
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,440
I...

594
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,040
want to have a friend, too, sometime.

595
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,320
I thought you might get bored if you just stayed inside the castle the whole time.

596
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,290
But if we get caught in this place by Nobunaga, we will be in real trouble...

597
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:44,940
Goemon.

598
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:45,900
Yes.

599
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,680
Have we... become friends?

600
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,650
Thanks to you, Goemon...

601
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,120
I don't see those scary dreams anymore.

602
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,040
Here...

603
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,350
Thanks for everything until today.

604
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,230
Good bye.

605
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,360
Goemon.

606
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,330
I'm here.

607
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,670
It's a present for taking care of Chacha.

608
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,200
Have you become strong?

609
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,860
I...

610
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,090
don't know yet.

611
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,770
That's all right.

612
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,450
What?

613
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,950
Nobunaga!

614
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,980
This is Akemichi's treason.

615
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,720
In the Honno temple...

616
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,570
So you've finally done it.

617
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,080
Well done...

618
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:45,520
Sorry, but... I'll take the governmental power.

619
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,640
Nobunaga!

620
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,050
Ishida Mitsunari?

621
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,680
Will he become his henchman?

622
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,290
Both Hideyoshi and Mitsunari were born as peasants.

623
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,060
But they...

624
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,360
climbed to the top until they got the governmental power.

625
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,200
So, we, too...

626
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,580
will become samurai one day.

627
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,200
I don't need that.

628
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,640
I...

629
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,250
want to become free.

630
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,190
It's a farewell gift.

631
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,760
What happened to the sword?

632
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,760
I've thrown it away.

633
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,700
I won't thank you for it.

634
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,200
Not necessary.

635
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,210
I don't want to hear that from you anyway.

636
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,940
If you'd kill Hideyoshi now...

637
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,240
This world would return to war again.

638
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,370
Wars would break out everywhere...

639
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,980
And lots of innocent people would get killed.

640
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,250
Who cares.

641
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,320
I'm free to do whatever I want.

642
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,430
If you hadn't stolen that box...

643
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:07,120
that child's mother wouldn't have died.

644
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,260
Don't get your surroundings involved...

645
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,160
while you're glorifying your freedom.

646
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,080
Freedom doesn't mean living from day to day without a goal.

647
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,170
You should understand at least that much.

648
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,680
And what about you?

649
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,910
Your stupid boss made you work hard...

650
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,480
So you went and dyed your hands in blood.

651
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,420
"Just a little bit more, and...

652
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,590
I'll become a samurai soon."

653
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,620
And then...

654
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,370
That was all.

655
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,270
Preaching an impious man can be a difficult task.

656
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,880
I have a wife and children...

657
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,340
That poor lady.

658
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,880
You're right.

659
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,820
I think we won't ever meet again.

660
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,950
Next time we meet...

661
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,650
I'll kill you.

662
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,370
Hey.

663
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,170
That attitude doesn't suit you very well.

664
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:29,970
You should change your occupation.

665
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,480
You're too flashy.

666
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,850
For a thief.

667
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:42,330
I'm a master thief!

668
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,760
Don't call yourself that way.

669
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,160
Rikyu.

670
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,540
Is it true that a war is going to start?

671
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,070
Why do you...

672
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,610
I can hear it, too...

673
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,580
That voice...

674
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,250
The war...

675
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,080
We must absolutely stop the war...

676
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,190
I understand.

677
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,020
Therefore...

678
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:21,020
We must obstruct his plans at any cost.

679
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,870
It's way too reckless.

680
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:28,060
So, I'll go to Hideyoshi...

681
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:28,760
You can't do that!

682
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:30,970
If you do that...

683
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:36,470
you would accept that you become Hideyoshi's concubine.

684
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,420
Please leave this to me.

685
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,320
Above all...

686
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,320
If this world crumbles, there won't be any tea ceremonies anymore.

687
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,930
If this happens, there will be nothing left for me to do.

688
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,920
It's nice to see that all of you have gathered here.

689
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:30,430
There's something I want to show you.

690
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,540
I don't like the Christians!

691
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,680
But they want to stop their religious mission...

692
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,450
And the weapons they were hiding behind their backs are quite fascinating, too.

693
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,350
Well, they were quite expensive, but...

694
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,360
they'll produce them in masses in no time...

695
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,300
We'll attack Korea and...

696
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,060
the Ming-Dynasty!

697
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,540
There's one more thing I want to show you.

698
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,690
Be good...

699
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:44,560
Maybe you should have sticked with holding tea ceremonies.

700
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,420
Do you want to...

701
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,950
ruin my dreams?

702
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,430
I'll send the soldiers out!

703
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,190
Let me do this!

704
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:12,870
You get the military, Kato. And you get the food, Konishi!

705
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,100
And I?

706
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,470
Mitsunari...

707
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,740
You were here, too?

708
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,280
Well, everyone...
