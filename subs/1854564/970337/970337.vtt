since he did pass right through
the barrier from Thalia's tree...

132
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.177
- Don't say it.
- ...it means he's most likely a god-spawn.

Seriously, don't worry.
It's just Mr. D.

150
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:51.106

You've done nothing, Percy.

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.621
Exactly.

155
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.251
As you know, you are believed
to be Poseidon's only heir.

156
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.127
Yeah, so?

157
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:16.416
So, it would seem that belief
has been held in error.

158
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.668
Hold on. You're saying Percy has a brother?

159
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:20.297
Or a sister.

160
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:26.100
Holy Styx. Another
Poseidon half-blood.

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:28.935
Not exactly.

162
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.598
Technically,
Tyson is not a half-blood.

163
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.017
Half-bloods are half-human,
hence the name.

I don't get it.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.735
If this new kid is not half-human,
then what other half is he?

166
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.032
Nymph. Sea nymph.

167
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.364
And when you cross a deity

Don't touch.
It's a Gewürztraminer.

Hi, Brother.

171
00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:16.267
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.

172
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.478
Yeah. Yeah.

Hey, they put peppers in yours.
Are you gonna eat that?

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.031
Go ahead.

175
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.787

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.247
I think he's hungry.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.374
No, not him.
I meant Poseidon.

178
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.413
Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?

179
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.842
A half-brother?
A Cyclops? Come on.

180
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.001
(SLURPING LOUDLY)

181
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.969
I think the politically correct
term is "ocularly impaired."

182
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.598
And a half-brother
is better than nothing.

183
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.096
I like having a brother.

184
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.802
Dad was cool to bring me here.

185
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.183
- Dad? Dad brought you here?
- Uh-huh.

186
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.269
I was upstate, in the woods.

187
00:12:56.359 --> 00:13:00.569
One day, this trident shows up over my
head, and then it started moving south.

188
00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:04.194
And you followed it.
You followed it here.

189
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.199
It glowed.

190
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.407
Well, somebody has got a new brother.

191
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.827
And I can see he's got his daddy's eyes.

192
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:13.991
Well...

193
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.701
"Eye."

194
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.213
You should really get him
some sprayable mist.

195
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:23.421
Anyway, it is kind of interesting
timing, don't you think?

196
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:28.555
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed
another son to, you know...

197
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.841
represent.

198
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.384
Bull.

199
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.014
Excuse me?

200
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:34.519
Smells like bull.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.732

Hey, Chris, you coming?

205
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.408
No, I'm good.

206
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.921
That is so awesome.

207
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.631
It's chill.
The barrier is holding.

209
00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:19.810
A Colchis bull.

Come on!

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.025
- We have to find its weak spot.
- Does it have one?

214
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.152
Percy, distract it for me.

215
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.072
Hey!

Damn it, Jackson.

229

Do you have any idea how hard
Colchis bulls are to come by?

230
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.876
Maybe next time you try to drown someone...

231
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:17.845
you'll first make sure he's
not a demigod who can swim.

232
00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.266
Luke?

233
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.892
Turns out, you're not the only
half-blood who's hard to kill.

234
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.685
You know, prophecy.

235
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.943
What prophecy? What are you talking about?

236
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.607
You don't know?

237
00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:40.404
Huh.

238
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:45.452
Add that to the long list of things your
buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.

239
00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:49.581
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest...

240
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.708
they don't care about us.

241
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:56.049
To them, we're just kids.

242
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:59.507
A bunch of pawns meant to be
pushed around, told what to do.

243
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.347
I'm not the only half-blood
who thinks so.

244
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.555
Think about it.

245
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.317
What did I miss?

246
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.617
Where's Percy?

247
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.821
Last time I saw him, he was getting
dragged by a Colchis bull.

248
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.781
Hey, you.

249
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.541
How come you aren't barbecued?

250
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.209
Cyclopes are fireproof.

251
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.753
How did the bull get through the barrier?

252
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:37.089
Oh, my gods.

253
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:01.239
Poisoned.

254
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.321
Is she...
Is the tree dead?

255
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:05.110
No, but dying.

256
00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:11.492
A condition we're about to
become all too familiar with.

257
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:15.996
Everybody, we're going to need a guard
detail to patrol the perimeter.

258
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:19.086
It feels like she's dying all over again.

259
00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.260
Who would do this?

260
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.971
PERCY: Luke poisoned the tree.

261
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.094
Percy!

262
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.222
Yay, you're alive.

263
00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.145
Yeah, I'm not the only one.

264
00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.264
Luke let the bull in.

265
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:35.853
Without the tree's barrier...

266
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:39.527
he probably figures there's enough Demi-Titans
out there to get him what he wants.

267
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.821
And that would be what, exactly?

268
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.234
Our annihilation,
Ms. La Rue.

269
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.865
Our annihilation.

270
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.454
How's the antidote coming?

271
00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.834
Slowly.

272
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.668
I know this probably isn't the best time...

273
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.471
but there's something I have to ask you.

274
00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:07.923
What is it?

275
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.511
It was something Luke
said about a prophecy...

276
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:14.680
how I'm mentioned in it.

277
00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.566
Do you know anything about this?

278
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.111
Knowledge isn't always power, Percy.

279
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.902
Sometimes, it's a burden.

280
00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.116
I know that.

281
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:31.116
But like you said, I've been
pretty unexceptional lately.

282
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:35.372
It's got me wondering
if I'm prophecy-worthy.

283
00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:37.831
They say that when the gods
wish to torture us...

284
00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.709
they answer our prayers.

285
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:43.546
ANNABETH: Necklace of Harmonia,
Hercules' bow, Golden Apple of Discord.

286
00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.510
Three millennia of gods and demigods...

287
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:48.680
you'd think that someone would have
come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.

288
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:52.476
GROVER: Persephone did come up with
Miracle-Gro. Maybe we can try that.

289
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:53.931
That's it.

290
00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.479
Right here.

291
00:21:57.775 --> 00:22:00.984
That is not gonna cure Thalia's
tree so much as get us all killed.

292
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.311
Me, in particular.

293
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:05.238
It's perfect. It's exactly what we need.

294
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:08.199
I'm taking this to Mr. D.

295
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.401
No.

296
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:18.995
I was hoping to spare you this onus a
little while longer, but go inside.

297
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:20.579
Upstairs, to the attic.

298
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:23.165
And when you come back down,
we'll talk some more.

299
00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.002
Assuming you're still sane, that is.

300
00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:01.461
I am the spirit of Delphi...

301
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.464
speaker of the prophecies
of Phoebus Apollo...

302
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.966
slayer of the mighty Python.

303
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:10.800
Approach, seeker, and ask.

304
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:15.600
I heard there was a prophecy about me.

305
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.135
Aye.

306
00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:22.149
But before you learn the
future, know first the past.

307
00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:27.487
<i>Long ago, before our time...</i>

308
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.693
<i>before Olympus and the gods...</i>

309
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:33.156
<i>Titans ruled the world.</i>

310
00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.445
<i>Led by Kronos...</i>

311
00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:40.038
<i>a force so evil,
he devoured his own children.</i>

312
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.702
<i>But three of his sons escaped.</i>

313
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.169
<i>Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.</i>

314
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.762
<i>They destroyed Kronos...</i>

315
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:57.468
<i>and banished his remains
to the depths of Tartarus.</i>

316
00:23:58.187 --> 00:24:02.352
<i>But Kronos is fated to rise again...</i>

317
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:07.269
<i>to exact his vengeance on
Olympus, and the world.</i>

318
00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:14.364
<i>Only one half-blood child of the
three eldest gods can defeat him.</i>

319
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:17.779
<i>This child shall be our salvation...</i>

320
00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:21.121
<i>or the cause of our destruction.</i>

321
00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:28.374
<i>It all begins when two cousins
grapple for a fleece...</i>

322
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:31.752
<i>the son of the sea and the lightning thief.</i>

323
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:33.712
Luke.

324
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.381
And that half-blood
of the eldest gods...

325
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.551
shall reach 20 against all odds.

326
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:42.971
"And see the world in endless sleep...

327
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.937
"the evil soul, cursed blade shall reap.

328
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:48.977
"A single choice shall end his days...

329
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:52.439
"Olympus to preserve or raze."

330
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:56.075
And that is "raze" with a "Z,"
as in "destroy."

331
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.069
I asked.

332
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:04.451
Is there any chance, any chance at all...

333
00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:07.917
that I might not be
the guy in the prophecy?

334
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.924
The Oracle references a
half-blood of the eldest gods.

335
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.130
You are the only living half-blood
heir of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.

336
00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.639
The prophecy could refer only to you.

337
00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:22.428
What if I destroy Olympus...

338
00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.768
by not being good enough to save it?

339
00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:29.275
That seems to be the question, doesn't it?

340
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.232
MR. D: It's absolutely
out of the question.

341
00:25:32.322 --> 00:25:34.063
If you could just listen
to me for one moment--

342
00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:36.115
I am listening.
You want to go on a quest.

343
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.533
Oh! It must be Thursday.

344
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.407
I'm serious. I'm absolutely
sure that this is gonna work.

345
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:41.487
(SIGHS)

346
00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:44.540
It was such a good year.

347
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.327
The Golden Fleece can heal any
living person or thing...

348
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.754
including Thalia's tree.

349
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:53.087
We heal the tree, we restore
the barrier around camp.

350
00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:56.424
I'm surprised you want to go along
with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.

351
00:25:56.513 --> 00:25:57.503
Underwood.

352
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:58.759
Whatever.

353
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:02.600
Every satyr who has ever gone
after the Fleece has died.

354
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.262
Right?
I mentioned that to her.

355
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.900
But it's a risk I'm willing to
take for the good of the camp.

356
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.902
Look, the last I heard...

357
00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:15.735
the Golden Fleece
was in the Sea of Monsters...

358
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:17.907
what the humans call the Bermuda Triangle.

359
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.406
A place not only a satyr
should be afraid of.

360
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:24.206
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

361
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.281
Annabeth.

362
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:28.543
Whatever.
It's a terrible idea.

363
00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:31.170
I've had a grand idea.

364
00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.466
Unless Thalia's tree can be cured...

365
00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:39.801
and the protective barrier
around our camp restored...

366
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:43.637
then every demigod, centaur,
satyr and nymph...

367
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:46.511
will be killed within days, if not sooner.

368
00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:48.312
Hey, you okay?

369
00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.433
Don't worry, camp will be okay.

370
00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:53.893
You have to have faith, right?

371
00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:56.604
But fortunately,
I have considered the matter.

372
00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:58.356
And after great study...

373
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.066
I have determined that the only thing

374
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.784
that has the power to save Thalia's tree...

375
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.611
and therefore our home...

376
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.742
is the Golden Fleece of myth...

377
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.288
What?

378
00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:11.248

379
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:17.292
...can heal every person
and every thing.

381
00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:22.886
So, a quest, a mission
of mercy, if you will...

382
00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.516
into uncharted and deadly waters...

383
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.932
with nothing less at stake
than our own survival.

384
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:35.232
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn, as
you know, to the power of the Fleece.

385
00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:39.489
And therefore, it must be a satyr who
will guide a half-blood on this quest.

386
00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:41.316
Thanks a lot.

387
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:42.859

Don't worry about always
coming in second, Jackson.

You do get used to it.

Listen, Luke is still out there.

407
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:39.128
He's involved with the Fleece somehow...

408
00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:41.964
and I've got a feeling
that he's not done yet.

409

that I don't really care.

even made it into the army at all.

too badly while I'm gone. Okay?

This is a bad idea.

422
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.735
You don't even know what I was gonna say.

423
00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.318

Look, I get what you're doing here.

426
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.995
You're worried about
the one-quest wonder thing...

427
00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:57.793
and you want to make your bones.

428

But Ichneutae and Clarisse are
already going after the Fleece...

429

I think this is my quest, too.

Luke for the Fleece.

"Grapples."

00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.043

00:55:07.179 --> 00:55:08.215

Piece of cake.

888
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.077
I think I'm gonna vomit.

889
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:38.658
Yep.

890
00:55:40.295 --> 00:55:42.287
So, how does this work?

891
00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:46.128
I don't know. It's my
first mythical tape gun.

892
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:07.396
Just like Hermes said...

00:56:08.156 --> 00:56:09.237
"Instant hole."

Join me, Percy.

904
00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:58.882
It's what you were meant to do.

905
00:57:59.267 --> 00:58:01.054
You can't escape that prophecy.

906
00:58:01.979 --> 00:58:03.720
Let's show both of our fathers.

00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:05.975

Come on.

Oh, no.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.286
Hey.

937
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.244
Do you want to steer for a while?

938
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:17.755
Thank you.

939
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.709
Nobody's ever trusted me
with anything before.

940
01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.796
Is that because of your lack
of depth perception?

941
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.391
Is it because they're scared of you?

942
01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.472
I was in the mountains one day...

943
01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:40.233
and some campers, Boy Scouts, showed up.

944
01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:46.613
And when they saw me, they screamed.

945
01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:49.654
They ran.

946
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.707
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.

947
01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:59.376
People look at me, and they see a monster.

948
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.458
Sometimes, I think maybe they're right.

949
01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.719
You're not a monster.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

950
01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.635
Easy for you to say.

951
01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.144
What do you mean?

952
01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:17.599
You never doubt yourself or
think you're less than you are.

953
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.688
Thank you, brother.

954
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.942
Come here. Open it slowly.

955
01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.325
Slowly.

956
01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:34.157
Hey, just take it slow.
Slow, okay?

957
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:43.295
I wouldn't have trusted him
with a normal thermos.

958
01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:45.675
He seems okay.

959
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:48.679
I really don't get what
your problem with him is.

960
01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.350
Because you don't know
what I know about them.

I'm sorry.

965
01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.114
I never knew.

966
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.875
Well, it's not something
I like talking about.

969
01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.718
It's the Sea of Monsters.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.734
Why are we stopping?

971
01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.231
I should have used two hands.

No. I just finished

Yes, of course, I can steer a ship.

Well...

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.754
Oh, now you miss Ichneutae?

1063
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.924
We ran into Scylla, that
multi-headed Hydra thing.

1064

He said, "I got this."

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:33.579
I think your Confederate warship is
heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.

1073
01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:39.414
I know this sounds insane, but
it's kind of like my dyslexia.

read Greek, I can see map lines.

No, he lives on an island.

1092
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.075
But the goddess Circe thought building an
amusement park on top of it was a good idea.

1093
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.401
It really wasn't.

You should consider yourselves lucky.

Percy.

1247

I never called him "brother."

1248
01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:53.361
All he ever wanted was a brother...

1249
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.277
but I was too wrapped up in myself.

1250
01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.827

1251
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.162

just like the Oracle said.

You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.

1255
01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.096
You're angry at Poseidon for ignoring you?

1256
01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:23.098
Then show him why he shouldn't.

1257
01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.848
You're upset about Tyson?

1258
01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.435
Then make sure he didn't die for nothing.

1259
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.235
She's right.

1260
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.901

1261
01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:37.818
There's no way you're
getting me to repeat that.

1263

is that we're with you.

1264

1265
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:47.455
Why me?

1266
01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.878
I mean, who voted me leader?

betrayed by his sons...
