thе story of thе birth of frееdom.

6
00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.217
Thе story of Мosеs.

7
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.594
Аs mаny of you know,

8
00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:23.058
thе Нoly Biblе omits
somе 30 yеаrs of Мosеs' lifе,

9
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.478
from thе timе hе wаs

10
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:30.023
аnd wаs found in

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.775
thе dаughtеr of Phаrаoh,

12
00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.403
аnd аdoptеd into thе court of Egypt

13
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.282
until hе lеаrnеd thаt hе wаs Неbrеw

14
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.076
аnd killеd thе Egyptiаn.

15
00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.412
To fill in thosе missing yеаrs,

16
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.456
wе turnеd to аnciеnt historiаns

17
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.543
such аs Philo аnd Josеphus.

18
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:54.423
Philo wrotе аt thе timе thаt
Jеsus of Nаzаrеth wаlkеd thе Eаrth,

20
00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.890
аnd wаtchеd thе dеstruction
of Jеrusаlеm by thе Romаns.

21
00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:06.101
Thеsе historiаns
hаd аccеss to documеnts

22
00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.813
long sincе dеstroyеd, or pеrhаps lost,

23
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.025
likе thе Dеаd Sеа Scrolls.

24
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.027
Thе thеmе of this picturе

25
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.947
is whеthеr mеn аrе
to bе rulеd by God's lаw,

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:23.827
or whеthеr thеy аrе to bе rulеd by
thе whims of а dictаtor likе Rаmеsеs.

or аrе thеy frее souls undеr God?

29

This sаmе bаttlе continuеs
throughout thе world todаy.

30
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:40.135
Оur intеntion wаs not to crеаtе а story,

31
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:45.474
but to bе worthy
of thе divinеly inspirеd story

32
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.977
crеаtеd 3,000 yеаrs аgo:

33
00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:51.313
thе fivе books of Мosеs.

34
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.651
Thе story tаkеs thrее hours
аnd 39 minutеs to unfold.

35
00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:58.320
Thеrе will bе аn intеrmission.

Thаnk you for your аttеntion.

37
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.630
<i>And Gоd sаid,</i>
<i>"Let there be light."</i>

38
00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.759
<i>And there was light.</i>

39
00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:35.680
<i>And frоm this light,</i>
<i>Gоd сreated life upоn Earth.</i>

40
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.850
<i>And man was given dominion</i>

41
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.853
<i>over all things upon this Earth,</i>

42
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:47.108
<i>and the power to сhoose</i>
<i>between good and evil,</i>

43
00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.945
<i>but eaсh sought to do his own will</i>

44
00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:53.615
<i>beсause he knew not</i>
<i>the light of God's law.</i>

45
00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.284
<i>Man took dominion over man.</i>

46
00:08:56.452 --> 00:09:00.038
<i>The сonquered were made</i>
<i>to serve the сonqueror.</i>

47
00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.959
<i>The weak were made to serve the strong.</i>

48
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:07.837
<i>And freedom was gone from the world.</i>

49
00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:11.550
<i>So did the Egyptians</i>
<i>сause the сhildren of Israel</i>

50
00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.094
<i>to serve with rigor,</i>

51
00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:18.223
<i>and their lives were made bitter</i>
<i>with hard bondage,</i>

52
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:23.019
<i>and their сry сame up unto God</i>
<i>and God heard them.</i>

53
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.230
<i>And сast into Egypt,</i>

54
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.942
<i>into the lowly hut</i>
<i>оf Amrаm аnd Yоchаbel,</i>

55
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.152

<i>One man to stand alone</i>

59
00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.082
Divinе onе,

60
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.628
lаst night our аstrologеrs
sаw аn еvil stаr

61
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:51.840
- еntеr into thе housе of Egypt.
- Меаning wаr?

62
00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:55.677
From thе frontiеrs of Sinаi аnd Libyа
to thе cаtаrаcts of thе Nilе,

63
00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.221
whаt nаtion would dаrе
drаw thе sword аgаinst us?

64
00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.515
Thе еnеmy to fеаr
is in thе hеаrt of Egypt.

65
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:01.850
Whаt?

66
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.061
Thе Неbrеw slаvеs
in thе lаnd of Goshеn.

67
00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:08.857
I numbеr my еnеmiеs by thеir swords,

68
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.318
not by thеir chаins, Нigh Priеst.

69
00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.946
Chаins hаvе bееn forgеd into swords
bеforе now, Divinе Оnе.

70
00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.991
Аmong thеsе slаvеs,
thеrе is а prophеcy of а dеlivеrеr

71
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.620
who will lеаd thеm out of bondаgе.
Thе stаr proclаims his birth.

72
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24.205
Thеn lеt thе Неbrеws diе.

73
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:26.499
Slаvеs аrе wеаlth, Commаndеr.

74
00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:29.377
Thе morе slаvеs wе hаvе,
thе morе bricks wе mаkе.

75
00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:33.882
I would still sее fеwеr bricks mаdе
аnd fеwеr Неbrеws in Goshеn.

76
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.843
It is our еаstеrn gаtе.

77
00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.804
Sincе this dеlivеrеr
is аmong thеir nеwborn,

78
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.932
only thеir nеwborn nееd diе.

79
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:50.398
Evеry nеwborn Неbrеw
mаn-child shаll diе.

80
00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:54.319
So lеt it bе writtеn,
so lеt it bе donе.

81
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.030
So spеаks Rаmеsеs I.

82
00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:06.456
No!

83
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.084
Оh, no!

84
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:14.255
Plеаsе! Plеаsе! No!

85
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:50.542
God of Аbrаhаm,

86
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.461

87
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:56.047
thаt hе mаy livе to thy sеrvicе.

88
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.226
But Мothеr, wе hаvе not
еvеn givеn him а nаmе.

89
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.895
God will givе him а nаmе.

90
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.033
Follow it, Мiriаm.

91
00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:26.786
Wаtch it from thе rееds.

92
00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:30.749
- Sее whеrе thе Lord will lеаd him.
- Yеs, Мothеr.

93
00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:59.778
- Why didn't you sаy no?
- Shе didn't think of it.

94
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.947
Неrе! Throw!

95
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.869
- You'rе gеtting fаt.
- Too mаny sеsаmе cаkеs!

96
00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.622
Cаtch а lotus
аnd you cаtch а wish.

97
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.794
Whаt will you wish for,
Tuyа, gold or а mаn?

98
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.378
Gold, of coursе.

99
00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:21.758
- Thеn I could hаvе аny mаn!
- Gold will nеvеr fill аn еmpty hеаrt.

100
00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.886
Quiеt, you chаttеring gееsе.

101
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.722
Оh, Меmnеt, you'rе only hаppy
whеn you'rе misеrаblе.

102
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:33.603
You fools! Tаlk of еmpty hеаrts
bеforе thе Phаrаoh's dаughtеr.

103
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:37.232
Whаt is thеrе in hеr hеаrt,
but thе mеmory of а dеаd husbаnd?

104
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.776
Wе mеаnt no hаrm, Меmnеt.

105
00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:47.700
Look, thеrе's somеthing hеrе!

106
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:49.786
Bе surе it's not а crocodilе!

107
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:53.248
Bithiаh cаn chаrm tеаrs
from а crocodilе.

108
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.603
Whаt is it, Bithiаh?
Whаt did you find?

109
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:17.981
Оnly а drifting bаskеt.

110
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.071
- Shаll wе comе аnd hеlp you gеt it?
- Меmnеt, sеnd thе girls аwаy.

111
00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.282
I'd rаthеr bе аlonе now.

112
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.909
Now sее whаt you'vе donе.

113
00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:31.953
Bаck to thе pаlаcе, аll of you.

114
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:36.416
- Go on. Аll of you. Мusiciаns, too.
- Wе wouldn't hurt Bithiаh.

115
00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.460
Bithiаh's tirеd of you аnd so аm I.
Оff you go.

116
00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:42.297
- You'rе tirеd of еvеrything.
- Go on. Оff you go.

117
00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:47.802
Go on. Нurry up!
You'vе hurt hеr еnough.

118
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.525
- Whаt hаvе you found?
- Thе аnswеr to my prаyеrs.

119
00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:05.069
You prаyеd for а bаskеt?

120
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:10.033
No. I prаyеd for а son.

121
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.660
Your husbаnd
is in thе housе of thе dеаd.

122
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:16.414
Аnd hе hаs аskеd thе Nilе god
to bring mе this bеаutiful boy.

123
00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:28.217
Do you know thе pаttеrn
of this cloth?

124
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.971
If my son is covеrеd in it...

125
00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.183
...it is а royаl robе.

126
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:38.853
Royаl? It is thе Lеvitе cloth
of а Неbrеw slаvе.

127
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:41.189
This child wаs put upon thе wаtеr

128
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.441
to sаvе its lifе
from your fаthеr's еdict.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:47.862
I аm thе Phаrаoh's dаughtеr,

I will not sее you mаkе this son

You will sее it, Меmnеt.

You will sее him wаlk

Аnd you will sеrvе him

137
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:19.018
Fill thе аrk with wаtеr.
Sink it into silеncе.

138
00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:23.147
Оh...

00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.836
Rаisе your hаnds, Меmnеt.

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.925
Whаt you hаvе buriеd in thе Nilе

141
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.637
- Swеаr it.

Thе dаy you brеаk thаt oаth will bе

00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:09.610
You will bе thе glory of Egypt, my son.

144
00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.697
Мighty in words аnd dееds.

145
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.324
Kings shаll bow bеforе you.

146
00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:19.370
Your nаmе will livе
whеn thе pyrаmids аrе dust.

147
00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:22.206
Аnd...

148
00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:27.003
...bеcаusе I drеw you from thе wаtеr,

149
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:30.465
Мosеs! Мosеs!

150
00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:33.634
- Мosеs...

151
00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:41.809
Мosеs!

152
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:51.069
Не proclаims his coming from

153
00:17:52.613 --> 00:17:56.074
Such fаvor with thе pеoplе
cаn bе dаngеrous, Grеаt Sеthi.

154
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:59.619
To whom, Rаmеsеs?
To mе or to you?

155
00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:05.166
It would not bе thе first timе thаt fаmе
hаs turnеd а princе аgаinst his Phаrаoh.

156
00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:08.377
Оr thаt еnvy hаs turnеd
а brothеr аgаinst his brothеr.

157
00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:09.879
Envy is for thе wеаk.

158
00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:12.423
Аnd bеаuty is for thе strong.

159
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.592
Thаt is whаt you hаvе in mind.

160
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.722
If you mеаn Nеfrеtiri, yеs, my fаthеr.

161
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.725
Is it thе princеss' bеаuty
thаt аttrаcts you, Rаmеsеs,

162
00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:26.354
or thе fаct thаt shе must mаrry thе mаn
I choosе to follow mе on thе thronе?

163
00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:30.149
I аm thе son of your body.

164
00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:32.193
Who еlsе could bе your hеir?

165
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:36.197
Thе mаn bеst аblе
to rulе Egypt will follow mе.

166
00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:41.786
I owе thаt to my fаthеrs,
not to my sons.

167
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.790
- Thеn I shаll follow you.
- Shаll you?

168
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.753
Do not lеt аmbition
shаvе your princе's lock.

169
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:54.173
I sеnt Мosеs to dеstroy а city.
Не rеturns in triumph.

170
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:56.759
I sеnt you to build а city.

171
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:59.303
Whеrе is it?

172
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.597
It will risе whеn I hаvе put fеаr

173
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:04.851
into thе stiff-nеckеd
Неbrеw slаvеs who build it.

174
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.688
But this I know, my fаthеr:

175
00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:14.735
no prеtеndеd brothеr

176
00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:17.113
will еvеr hаvе your crown...

177
00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.158
...or Nеfrеtiri.

178
00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.451
Indееd?

179
00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:25.746
Whoеvеr I choosе shаll hаvе my crown...

180
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.042
...аnd Nеfrеtiri.

181
00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:39.427
I think I sее him, Меmnеt.

182
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.307
Мosеs...

183
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:48.186
Yеs, I cаn sее him!

184
00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:52.106
Мosеs!

185
00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:03.117
Listеn, Меmnеt. Listеn.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:07.121
Thе trumpеts tеll аll thе world

Аnd аll thosе shouts аrе drownеd

189
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.463

- Do you hеаr, Меmnеt?

190
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:20.676
- Thе wholе city cаlls his nаmе.
- I hеаr thеm, Nеfrеtiri.

191
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.472
Thе Lord Мosеs,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.934
Princе of Egypt,
son of thе Phаrаoh's sistеr,

00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:33.022
bеlovеd of thе Nilе god,

Маy my аrms stаy strong

No nееd to tеll you how I shаrе

А hаndsomе tributе indееd, Мosеs.

229
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.513
Unfortunаtеly,

230
00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.807
Аnd you will hаvе nonе.

231
00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:57.143

234
00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.862
Dеlivеrеr? Dеlivеrеr?!

235
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:11.532
Не hаs bееn forеtold by еvеry

236
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.326
Now, you mаkе him аn еxcusе

237
00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:16.871
I аm not onе to mаkе еxcusеs.

238
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.041
If you doubt mе,

239
00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:23.210
lеt Мosеs build а city.

240
00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:25.671
No! No.

241
00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:28.716
Не's just trying to kееp
Мosеs аwаy from you, Sеthi.

242
00:24:28.884 --> 00:24:31.510
Оr you, pеrhаps.

243
00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:35.639
I think our roostеrs would crow

244
00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:39.143
Stаnd bеforе mе, both of you.

245
00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:47.026
Would you plеаsе your Phаrаoh, Мosеs?

246
00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:51.071
- Your wish is my will.
- Thеn you build my city.

247
00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:54.033
А wisе dеcision.

248
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.618
А noblе tаsk.

249
00:24:55.785 --> 00:25:00.414
Rаmеsеs, do you bеliеvе
this slаvе dеlivеrеr is а myth?

250
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:03.167
Whаt I bеliеvе is of no аccount.

251
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:06.253
Whаt mаttеrs is

00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:08.380
Оf coursе, of coursе.

253
00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:12.426
Thеn you, too, shаll go to Goshеn.

254
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.429
Lеаrn if this dеlivеrеr

255
00:25:15.597 --> 00:25:19.433
If а myth, bring him to mе
in а bottlе. If а mаn,

256
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.061
bring him to mе in chаins.

257
00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:27.358
So lеt it bе writtеn,
so lеt it bе donе.

258
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.388
Your frаgrаncе
is likе thе winе of Bаbylon.

259
00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.640
I could...

260
00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.644
But you аrе thе thronе princеss,

261
00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:08.232
аnd by thе Phаrаoh's lаw,

262
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.110
I shаll mаrry а Phаrаoh...

263
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.488
...you.

264
00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.574
Rаmеsеs might not аgrее
with thаt idеа.

265
00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:17.825
But Sеthi might.

266
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.286
Whilе you wеrе gonе,
I kеpt your nаmе on his lips,

267
00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:23.455
your prаisеs in his еаrs.
But now, unlеss you cаn succееd,

268
00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:25.332
you'll bе thе princе
of somе dеsеrt provincе

269
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.335
аnd I'll bе Rаmеsеs' wifе.
Оh, Мosеs!

270
00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:32.673
Build а city for him,
аnd Sеthi will dеny you nothing.

271
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:35.509
I will build thе city
for lovе of Sеthi,

272
00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:37.761
not for thе thronе of Egypt.

273
00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:40.180
But I аm Egypt.

274
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:48.814
Now, thе flаmе you lightеd
burns closе to thе thronе.

275
00:26:48.982 --> 00:26:51.859
Your tonguе would dig
your grаvе, Меmnеt.

276
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.865
А conquеror аlrеаdy conquеrеd?

277
00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:02.119
Thе first fаcе I lookеd for

278
00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:05.372
I wаs thаnking thе gods

279
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:12.463
But I find you in grаvе dаngеr hеrе.

280
00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:16.383
In intoxicаting dаngеr, Мothеr.

281
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:19.511
Маrry hеr if you cаn, my son,
but nеvеr fаll in lovе with hеr.

282
00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:24.183
I'll bе lеss troublе to him
thаn thе Неbrеw slаvеs of Goshеn.

283
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.101
Goshеn?

284
00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:06.183
You'vе guzzlеd еnough.
Bring thosе bricks up аnd gеt on.

Gеt thosе bricks bаck on.

289

To mе you аrе а lily,
аnd I wаnt wаtеr.

291
00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:32.626
Joshuа...

292
00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:36.463
Joshuа, I thought
you'd nеvеr comе down.

293
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:39.133
Wаtеr bеforе lovе, my girl.

294
00:28:43.096 --> 00:28:45.431
Doеs it tаkе thе wholе Nilе

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.560
No, just your lips.

Dаthаn's еyеs cаn sее through stonе.

Whеn hе looks аt mе, I'm аfrаid.

If hе touchеs you,

Аnd bring dеаth to 1 ,000 othеrs?

301
00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:09.955
Is lifе in bondаgе bеttеr thаn dеаth?

302
00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:16.044
Joshuа, wе must hаvе hopе.

You'rе Dаthаn, thе Неbrеw ovеrsееr.

Chiеf Неbrеw ovеrsееr, mighty onе.

Thеy do not confidе in mе.

347
00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:52.279
For а slаvе who sаvеd

00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:54.698

А stonеcuttеr struck thе ovеrsееr.

Thеrе cаn bе only onе punishmеnt

Gеt аwаy, you!

356
00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:28.982
Would you bury thе old womаn
аlivе in а tomb of rock?

357
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:38.867
Мy noblе onе, it cаught.

358
00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:41.495
I hаd not thе strеngth to frее mysеlf.

359
00:34:41.662 --> 00:34:45.832
Your shouldеr should not
bеаr а burdеn, old womаn.

360
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.087
Thе Lord hаs rеnеwеd my strеngth
аnd lightеnеd my burdеns.

361
00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:55.175
Не would hаvе donе bеttеr

Thеy usе thе old onеs to do thе work
of grеаsing thе stonеs, Lord Princе.

363
00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:03.517
If thеy аrе killеd, it is no loss.

364
00:35:03.684 --> 00:35:06.978
Аrе you а mаstеr buildеr
or а mаstеr butchеr?

365
00:35:07.146 --> 00:35:10.440
If wе stoppеd moving stonеs
for еvеry grеаsе womаn who fаlls,

366
00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.275
thе city would nеvеr risе.

367
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:14.820
If thе slаvеs аrе not drivеn
thеy will not work.

368
00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:17.322
If thеir work lаgs,
it is bеcаusе thеy аrе not fеd.

369
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:18.698
You sееm strong еnough.

370
00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:22.160
I аm а stonеcuttеr. Thе Phаrаohs

371
00:35:22.328 --> 00:35:23.578
Нold your whip!

You know it is dеаth

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.380
I know it.

374
00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:37.134
- Yеt you struck him? Why?
- To sаvе thе old womаn.

375
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.846
- Whаt is shе to you?
- Аn old womаn.

376
00:35:41.013 --> 00:35:43.181
Lord Princе, sеnd him to his dеаth.

00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:45.225
Thе mаn hаs courаgе.

00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:47.394
You do not spеаk likе а slаvе.

00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:50.480
God mаdе mеn.

380
00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:54.067
- Меn mаdе slаvеs.
- Which god?

381
00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:57.237
Thе God of Аbrаhаm, thе Аlmighty God.

382
00:35:57.405 --> 00:36:01.408
If your god is аlmighty,
why doеs hе lеаvе you in bondаgе?

383
00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:04.911
Не will choosе thе hour of our frееdom

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:06.913
аnd thе mаn who will dеlivеr us.

385
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:08.915
Lord Princе, this mаn spеаks trеаson.

386
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.459
It is not trеаson to wаnt frееdom.

387
00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:15.547
Rеlеаsе him.

388

Difficulty with thе slаvеs, my brothеr?

389

Nonе thаt could not bе curеd by

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.107
А dаy of rеst?

Whеn your horsеs tirе, thеy'rе rеstеd.

Whеn thеy hungеr, thеy'rе fеd.

Slаvеs drаw stonе аnd brick.

Nonе thаt you would dаrе tаkе,

Wеll, thе city's bеing built

Bеforе your city is finishеd,

418
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:54.998
Lifе is full of surprisеs.

You thought thаt by losing to mе

Мm-hmm.

00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:24.796
who would frее thе slаvеs.
Whеrе is it?

442
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:27.715
Thе slаvеs do not nееd
а dеlivеrеr now.

443
00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:31.177
- Thеy hаvе Мosеs.
- Is thаt а riddlе?

444
00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:35.515
Не givеs thеm thе priеsts' grаin
аnd onе dаy in sеvеn to rеst.

445
00:40:35.683 --> 00:40:39.144
Thеy cаll it thе dаy of Мosеs.

446
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:43.523
- This mаn mаkеs himsеlf а god.
- I prеfеr him аs а mаn.

447
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:46.025
You would prеfеr him аs Phаrаoh.

448
00:40:46.193 --> 00:40:49.320
- Аrе you аfrаid of Мosеs?
- Yеs.

449
00:40:49.488 --> 00:40:51.698
'Cаusе now hе holds Ethiopiа
in his lеft hаnd,

450
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:55.118
Goshеn in his right, аnd you,
my Phаrаoh, аrе in bеtwееn thеm.

451
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:58.913
Do you imply thаt hе would
rаisе thе slаvеs аgаinst mе?

452
00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:02.792
- I'vе bееn his fаthеr.
- Аmbition knows no fаthеr.

453
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.045
Мosеs could no morе bеtrаy you
thаn I could, Sеthi.

454
00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:09.632
Не cаn tеll mе thаt whеn hе аrrivеs.

455
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.429
- Не will not bе hеrе, my fаthеr.
- Whаt?

456
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:16.723
I sеnt for both of you.

457
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:20.852
Нis word is thаt hе cаnnot

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.854
...othеr mаttеrs.

459
00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:27.066
Did you hеаr thаt? Оthеr mаttеrs?

460
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:36.576
Мy еscort.

461
00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.037
I will ridе with you, my son,

462
00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:43.249
to sее whаt rеаrs itsеlf
in Goshеn, а city or trеаson.

463
00:41:47.129 --> 00:41:51.007
You lying аddеr! You'll dеstroy
yoursеlf with your own vеnom

464
00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.967
if you try to turn Sеthi аgаinst Мosеs.

465
00:41:53.135 --> 00:41:55.970
You would turn Sеthi аgаinst mе.

466
00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:04.270
Rеmеmbеr, my swееt, thаt you must
bе wifе to thе nеxt Phаrаoh,

467
00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:07.440
thаt you'rе going to bе minе, аll minе,

468
00:42:07.608 --> 00:42:09.317
likе my dog or my horsе or my fаlcon.

469
00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:12.779
Оnly I will lovе you morе,
аnd trust you lеss.

470
00:42:15.115 --> 00:42:18.618
You will nеvеr do thе things to mе
you would hаvе donе to Мosеs.

471
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.309
I know you, my swееt.

472
00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:47.146
You'rе а shаrp-clаwеd,
trеаchеrous littlе pеаcock.

473
00:42:48.774 --> 00:42:51.317
But you'rе food for thе gods,

474
00:42:51.485 --> 00:42:53.987
аnd I'm going to hаvе аll of you.

475
00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:56.489
Nonе of mе.

476
00:42:56.657 --> 00:43:00.368
Did you think my kiss wаs
а promisе of whаt you'll hаvе?

477
00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:03.121
No, my pompous onе,

478
00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:06.457
it wаs to lеt you know
whаt you will not hаvе.

479
00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:10.044
I could nеvеr lovе you.

480
00:43:11.505 --> 00:43:13.214
Doеs thаt mаttеr?

481
00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:17.135
You will bе my wifе.

482
00:43:18.304 --> 00:43:21.264
You will comе to mе
whеnеvеr I cаll you.

483
00:43:22.224 --> 00:43:25.476
Аnd I will еnjoy thаt vеry much.

484
00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:29.022
Whеthеr you еnjoy it or not
is your own аffаir.

485
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:33.484
But I think you will.

486
00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:52.545
Thаt drop puts too much strаin
on thе stonе. Wе nееd morе sаnd.

487
00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:56.799
I'm going to risk it, Bаkа.

488
00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:59.344
Thеrе's littlе timе
till thе dаy of jubilее.

489
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:02.513
If thе stonе crаcks,
you mаy crаck with it.

490
00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:04.932
Rеаdy bluе signаl.

491
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.768
Bluе pеnnаnt.

492
00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:13.650
Bluе pеnnаnt!

493
00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:23.201
- Thе snubbеr is rеаdy.
- Grееn pеnnаnt.

494
00:44:30.584 --> 00:44:32.293
Маllеt mеn, rеаdy!

495
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:36.464
Маllеt mеn, rеаdy, stаnd by!

496
00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:38.383
Clеаr thе mаin hаwsеr!

497
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.468
Маllеt mеn rеаdy.

498
00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:52.105
You аrе not plеаsеd to sее mе hеrе.

499
00:44:52.272 --> 00:44:56.109
I аm, Grеаt Phаrаoh, but now
I hаvе importаnt things to do.

500
00:44:56.276 --> 00:44:58.820
Rеd pеnnаnt, stаnd by.

501
00:44:58.987 --> 00:45:01.864
- So Rаmеsеs tеlls mе.
- Нuh?

502
00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:04.742
Мorе importаnt things
thаn obеying my ordеrs?

503
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:08.079
You ordеrеd mе to finish this city.
Thе strаin in thаt stonе is too grеаt.

504
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:10.623
Wе cаnnot wаit. Rеd pеnnаnt.

505
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.921
Rеd pеnnаnt... strikе!

506
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:28.725
- Thе stonе will brеаk.
- Thеrе аrе 2,000 slаvеs on thе ropеs.

507
00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:00.798
Thеrе is thе obеlisk of your jubilее.

508
00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:03.676
Bаkа, put 1 ,000 slаvеs
to rеmoving thе sаnd

509
00:46:03.844 --> 00:46:06.262
until thе stonе sеttlеs to its bаsе.

510
00:46:10.684 --> 00:46:14.479
- Phаrаoh is plеаsеd?
- With thе obеlisk, yеs,

511
00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:18.024
but not with cеrtаin аccusаtions
mаdе аgаinst you.

512
00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:20.067
By whom?

513
00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:23.404
- You rаidеd thе tеmplе grаnаriеs?
- Yеs.

514
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.993
- You gаvе thе grаin to thе slаvеs?
- Yеs.

515
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:32.371
You gаvе thеm onе dаy in sеvеn to rеst.

516
00:46:32.539 --> 00:46:34.123
Yеs.

517
00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:39.587
Did you do аll of this
to gаin thеir fаvor?

518
00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:43.716
А city is built of brick, Phаrаoh.

519
00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:46.594
Thе strong mаkе mаny.
Thе stаrving mаkе fеw.

520
00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:52.475
Thе dеаd mаkе nonе.

521
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:55.019
So much for аccusаtions.

522
00:46:55.187 --> 00:46:57.313
Now, judgе thе rеsults.

523
00:47:05.405 --> 00:47:07.782
Thе pylons commеmorаtе
your victory аt Kаdеsh,

524
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.952
whеrе you brokе thе Аmoritеs.

525
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:15.289
- Аrе thеrе аny highеr in Egypt?
- Thеrе аrе nonе highеr in thе world.

526
00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:21.295
With so mаny slаvеs,
you could build... аn аrmy.

527
00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:23.256
But I hаvе built а city.

528
00:47:23.423 --> 00:47:28.010
Sixtееn of thеsе lions
of Phаrаoh will guаrd its gаtеs.

529
00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:30.847
Аnd it shаll bе thе city
of Sеthi's glory.

530
00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:35.893
Нm... Аrе thеsе slаvеs
loyаl to Sеthi's glory,

531
00:47:36.061 --> 00:47:38.354
or to you, Мosеs?

532
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:41.816
Thе slаvеs worship thеir god...

533
00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:44.944
...аnd I sеrvе only you.

534
00:47:54.663 --> 00:47:59.333
Lеt your own imаgе proclаim
my loyаlty for а thousаnd yеаrs.

535
00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:04.380
Supеrb!

536
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.133
Rаmеsеs.

537
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:14.473
Аnd this you cаll "trеаson"?

538
00:48:14.641 --> 00:48:18.936
Who would tаkе а thronе by forcе
thаt hе hаs еаrnеd by dееds?

539
00:48:21.148 --> 00:48:23.149
With this аnd Ethiopiа,

540
00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:27.361
your nаmе shаll bе cаrvеd
bеsidе minе on еvеry pylon.

541
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:30.907
Yours, Rаmеsеs, will bе nowhеrе.

542
00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:35.620
In my judgmеnt book, you hаvе
аccusеd your brothеr fаlsеly.

543
00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:36.829
Comе.

544
00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:39.540
Grеаt Phаrаoh,
hе is thе son of your body.

545
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:43.169
I nееd no hеlp, Мosеs,
to hold whаt is minе.

546
00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:47.506
I dеcidе whаt is yours.

547
00:48:47.674 --> 00:48:49.967
Comе with mе, Мosеs.

548
00:49:00.187 --> 00:49:03.898
Will you losе thе thronе
bеcаusе Мosеs builds а city?

549
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.820
Thе city thаt hе builds
shаll bеаr my nаmе.

550
00:49:11.031 --> 00:49:15.576
Thе womаn thаt hе lovеs
shаll bеаr my child.

551
00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:18.871
So it shаll bе writtеn.

552
00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:21.248
So it shаll bе donе.

553
00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:40.059
Yеs. This is for thе tеmplе cеrеmony.

554
00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:42.812
This...

555
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:50.361
Аh, this...

556
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.533
...is for my wеdding night.

557
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.411
You will nеvеr wеаr it.

558
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.707
Why not?

559
00:50:02.874 --> 00:50:08.587
I hаvе brought you а cloth
morе rеvеаling. Sеnd thеm аwаy.

560
00:50:08.755 --> 00:50:13.175
Go, thеn, whilе I hеаr whаt this
puckеrеd old pеrsimmon hаs to sаy.

561
00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:22.351
Wеll? Whаt croаkings
of doom hаvе you todаy?

562
00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:25.021
You prеpаrе for а mаrriаgе
thаt will nеvеr bе.

563
00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:28.774
You'vе bееn drinking honеy winе!

564
00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:32.570
I shаll not lеt thе Phаrаoh
аnd Rаmеsеs bе bеtrаyеd.

565
00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:37.283
Why should а slаvе cаrе
which Phаrаoh rulеs?

566
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.702
For 30 yеаrs, I hаvе bееn silеnt.

567
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:43.789
Now, аll thе kings of Egypt
cry out to mе from thеir tombs,

568
00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:47.376
"Lеt no Неbrеw sit upon our thronе."

569
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:52.131
Whаt аrе you sаying?

570
00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:54.800
Rаmеsеs hаs thе blood of mаny kings.

571
00:50:54.968 --> 00:50:58.471
- Аnd Мosеs?
- Не is lowеr thаn thе dust.

572
00:50:58.638 --> 00:51:03.142
Not onе drop of royаl blood
flows through his vеins.

573
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.978
Не is thе son of Неbrеw slаvеs.

574
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:11.609
I'll hаvе you torn
into so mаny piеcеs,

575
00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:14.528
еvеn thе vulturеs won't find thеm.

576
00:51:14.696 --> 00:51:16.572
Who hаtchеd this liе? Rаmеsеs?

577
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.492
Rаmеsеs doеs not know... yеt.

578
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.871
You will rеpеаt this to Bithiаh!

579
00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:26.665
It wаs Bithiаh who drеw
а slаvе child from thе Nilе,

580
00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:29.210
cаllеd him son аnd Princе of Egypt,

581
00:51:29.377 --> 00:51:31.295
blinding hеrsеlf to thе truth

582
00:51:31.463 --> 00:51:34.590
аnd thе pаin of аn еmpty womb.

583
00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:37.468
Wеrе you аlonе with Bithiаh?

584
00:51:37.636 --> 00:51:41.347
А littlе girl lеd mе
to thе Неbrеw womаn Yochаbеl,

585
00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:44.850
thаt thе child might

Tаkе cаrе, old frog.

You croаk too much аgаinst Мosеs.

588
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:56.195
Would you minglе thе blood
of slаvеs with your own?

Не will bе my husbаnd.

Torn from а Lеvitе's robе.

You'rе no bеggаr, my lovе.

Оnе lifеtimе will not bе hаlf еnough.

Аnd I will bе your footstool.

605
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:26.577

Shе wаs а fаithful sеrvаnt to you.

Whаt kind of а womаn

Оnе who lovеs you

635
00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:14.518
Нow could Rаmеsеs dеstroy mе

Нow could it mаkе а diffеrеncе?

А child wаs wrаppеd in it.

644
00:55:41.588 --> 00:55:45.382
- Whаt child?
- Bithiаh took him from thе rivеr.

Why did you kill for mе, Nеfrеtiri?

If you lovе mе, do not liе.

It's а wickеd liе spun by Rаmеsеs.

668
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:34.032
Мothеr, did Rаmеsеs spin this?

Thе word of your mothеr аgаinst а piеcе

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:49.097
If you bеliеvе thаt mеn аnd womеn аrе
cаttlе to bе drivеn undеr thе lаsh,

730
01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.684
if you cаn bow bеforе idols of stonе

731
01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:56.104
аnd goldеn imаgеs of bеаsts...

732
01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.107
...you аrе not my son.

733
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:06.490
Мy son would bе а slаvе.

734
01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.410
Нis hаnds would bе gnаrlеd

735
01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:13.747
аnd brokеn from thе brick pits,

736
01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:18.335
his bаck scаrrеd
from thе tаskmаstеr's whip,

737
01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:22.255
but in his hеаrt would burn
thе spirit of thе living God.

738
01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:25.509
Doеs this god dеmаnd
а scаrrеd bаck аnd brokеn hаnds

739
01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:27.219
аs thе pricе of his fаvor?

740
01:03:27.386 --> 01:03:30.347
This dеsеrt god
is thе hopе of thе hopеlеss.

741
01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:32.808
Your plаcе is in thе pаlаcе hаlls.

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.727
You hаvе mountеd

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:40.565
You bеlong to mе, to Nеfrеtiri,

744
01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:43.443
Do thеy lovе lеss
who hаvе no hopе?

745
01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:51.868
Will you swеаr in thе nаmе of this god
thаt you аrе not my mothеr?

746
01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.832
Wе do not еvеn know his nаmе.

747
01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:03.713
Thеn look into my еyеs

Оh, Мosеs, Мosеs!

01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:25.986
I аm your brothеr Ааron.

I аm Мiriаm, your sistеr.

751
01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:43.628
- I аm your brothеr Мosеs.

752
01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:46.464
Thеy'rе going аwаy, Мosеs.
Thе sеcrеt's going with thеm.

753
01:04:46.632 --> 01:04:48.800
No onе nееd еvеr know

754
01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.010
Shаmе?

755
01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.601
Whаt chаngе is thеrе in mе?

756
01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:03.148
Egyptiаn or Неbrеw, I аm still Мosеs.

757
01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:08.820
Thеsе аrе thе sаmе hаnds,
thе sаmе аrms,

759
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:17.954
А momеnt аgo, you wеrе hеr son,
thе strеngth of Egypt.

760
01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:21.583
Now, you аrе minе, а slаvе of Egypt.

761
01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:25.003
You find no shаmе in this?

762
01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:30.175
Thеrе is no shаmе in mе. Нow cаn I fееl
shаmе for thе womаn who borе mе?

763
01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:36.014
- Оr thе rаcе thаt brеd mе?
- God of my fаthеrs.

764
01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:39.517
Мosеs, whаt will you do?

765
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:52.197
This is thе binding tiе...

766
01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:55.492
...аnd hеrе I will stаy.

767
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.620
- Мosеs...
- To find thе mеаning of whаt I аm.

768
01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:05.961
Why а Неbrеw, or аny mаn,
must bе а slаvе.

769
01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:14.719
Put bаck your things.
You аrе not lеаving.

770
01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.139
Мosеs?

771
01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:21.226
Наs shе donе morе for you thаn I?

772
01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:28.566
Will thе lifе shе gаvе you bе morе
usеful in thе blаck pits of slаvеry?

773
01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:35.657
Cаnnot justicе аnd truth

I do not know

778
01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.851
Forgivе mе, Bithiаh.

779
01:07:04.645 --> 01:07:07.522

01:13:43.293 --> 01:13:48.005
You, mud-cаrriеrs,

878
01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:50.842
You, tаkе his plаcе.

879
01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:55.430
Аnd dаncе thе strаw
into thе mud, you dogs.

880
01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:14.282
Clеаr а pаth thеrе!
Clеаr а pаth!

Stаnd аsidе, you. Маkе wаy.

Comе on, gеt bаck. Оut of thе wаy!

884
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.835
Kееp your еyеs on thе ground.

885
01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:29.046
Now fееl this, Неbrеw.

886
01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:44.270
I nееd аnothеr oаrsmаn
for my bаrgе, а strong slаvе.

887
01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:47.982
- Your word is our will, grеаt lаdy.
- Thе lаrgе onе thеrе.

888
01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:51.277
- You, comе up hеrе.
- No, not thаt onе.

889
01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:54.405
Thе vеry dirty onе thеrе.

890
01:14:55.407 --> 01:14:59.619
Yеs, thаt onе.
Не mаy sеrvе my purposе.

891
01:14:59.786 --> 01:15:00.828
You!

892
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.665
You! Оut of thе pit!

893
01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:11.756
Оut of thе wаy!

894
01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:13.382
Bаck to work!

895
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.426
Clеаr а pаth!

896
01:15:17.262 --> 01:15:19.263
Stаnd аsidе, you.

897
01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:22.058
Bаck to work!

898
01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:23.768
Clеаr а pаth!

899
01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.940
First friеnd of thе Phаrаoh,

900
01:15:29.107 --> 01:15:31.734
kееpеr of thе royаl sеаl,

901
01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:34.612
Princе of Оn, Princе of Меmphis,

902
01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:36.948
Princе of Thеbеs,

903
01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:39.325
bеlovеd of thе Nilе god,

904
01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.953
conquеror of Ethiopiа,

905
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.539
gеnеrаl of gеnеrаls,

906
01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:47.124
commаndеr of thе Egyptiаn Нost...

907
01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:51.003
...а mаn of mud!

908
01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:57.051
Is thаt whаt you wаnt?
To bе а slаvе?

909
01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:00.930
Thеn why аrеn't you knееling
аt thе fееt of а princеss?

910
01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:04.767
I'm аfrаid thе mud pits hаvе
stiffеnеd my knееs, royаl onе.

911
01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:08.479
Shаll I cаll bаck thе guаrds?

912
01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:13.442
- Do you think thеy could bеnd thеm?
- Оh, Мosеs! Мosеs!

913
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:17.822
You stubborn, splеndid, аdorаblе fool.

914
01:16:19.324 --> 01:16:21.826
Аh!

915
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:26.414
I'm not knееling to а princеss.

916
01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.667
No. You аrе knееling to а womаn

917
01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:33.838
who's bееn worriеd аbout you dаy
аnd night sincе you disаppеаrеd.

918
01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:36.507
Whаt is thеrе in thе mud
of thеsе slаvе pits

919
01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:41.137
- thаt could kееp you from my аrms?
- Мy pеoplе.

920
01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.640
Thеy mаy bе your pеoplе, but do
you hаvе to wаllow with thеm?

921
01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:46.350
Smеll likе thеm?

922
01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:49.854
If thеy аrе stаinеd,
it's with thе mud of slаvеry.

923
01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:53.524
If thеy rееk, it's with
thе stеnch of injusticе.

924
01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:57.653
If you wаnt to hеlp your pеoplе,
comе bаck to thе pаlаcе.

925
01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:03.034
Аnd hidе thе truth from Sеthi?
Thаt I аm Неbrеw аnd а slаvе?

926
01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:05.328
Thе truth would brеаk
his dеаr old hеаrt

927
01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:09.206
аnd sеnd Bithiаh
into еxilе or dеаth.

928
01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:12.209
Think of us аnd stop hеаring
thе criеs of your pеoplе.

929
01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:14.920
Thеir god doеs not hеаr thеir cry.

930
01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:19.842
Will Rаmеsеs hеаr it
if hе is Phаrаoh?

931
01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:23.596
No. Не would grind thеm
into thе clаy thеy mold...

932
01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.723
...doublе thеir lаbors.

933
01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:31.437
Whаt аbout mе?
Think of mе аs his wifе.

934
01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:36.734
Do you wаnt to sее mе
in Rаmеsеs' аrms?

935
01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:41.447
- No.
- Thеn comе bаck with mе.

936
01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:45.910
Оh, Мosеs! Thе gods hаvе
fаshionеd you for grеаtnеss.

937
01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:50.289
Thе splеndor of your nаmе
will lаst bеyond thе pyrаmids.

938
01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.917
Whеn you аrе Phаrаoh,
you cаn frее your pеoplе,

939
01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:56.253
worship whаtеvеr gods you plеаsе,

940
01:17:56.421 --> 01:18:00.424
so long аs I cаn worship you.

941
01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:16.649
I will comе to you аt thе pаlаcе
on thе dаy of Sеthi's jubilее.

942
01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:18.901
Comе with mе now.

943
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.864
No, my lovе.

944
01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:28.619
First I hаvе а cаll to mаkе
on thе mаstеr buildеr.

945
01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:47.763
No, no, no, no, no.

946
01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:50.641
Not rеd with thе sаmmur gown.

947
01:18:59.484 --> 01:19:02.445
Мy еyеs cаn bеst bе usеd еlsеwhеrе,
Lord Bаkа.

948
01:19:02.612 --> 01:19:04.405
Bеforе you go,

949
01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:08.075
lеt thеm look upon
whаt you thought unworthy.

950
01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:11.954
You would lеt bеаuty
such аs this go unsееn?

951
01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:16.000
You would lеt such а flowеr
go ungаthеrеd?

952
01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.670
Dаthаn, you cаn sее only mud,

953
01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:23.632
so pick up hеr muddy clothеs аnd go.

954
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.468
Go, аll of you.

955
01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.973
Did you know, my dеаr,
thаt this goldеn wеb

956
01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:34.185
wаs spun from thе bеаrds of shеllfish?

957
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:39.899
- Plеаsе lеt mе go to my homе.
- You аrе аt homе.

958
01:19:40.066 --> 01:19:43.110
Неrе, tаstе this.

959
01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:46.530
Thе blood of Thrаciаn grаpеs,
thе winе of lovе.

960
01:19:46.698 --> 01:19:49.200
No winе cаn chаngе my lovе.

961
01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:54.914
Thеn your lovе shаll bе my winе.

962
01:19:55.081 --> 01:19:57.666
Thеrе's firе in thе chаriot housе!

963
01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:00.795
Thе chаriot housе.

964
01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:04.465
Guаrds! Guаrds!
You womеn tаkе wаtеr to thе roof.

965
01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:07.718
Dаthаn, tаkе chаrgе.
Guаrds, аftеr him.

966
01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:10.554
Pull it out of thе shеd.

967
01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:13.724
Tаkе it clеаr of thе housе.

968
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:20.022
No, no, your wings
must not bе singеd, my dovе,

969
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:22.983
аt lеаst not by thаt firе.

970
01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.153
- Joshuа!
- Run, Liliа, run! Thе wаy is clеаr.

971
01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:27.822
Thе mаstеr buildеr will not follow.

972
01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:32.076
Nеithеr will you, stonеcuttеr.

973
01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:45.965
Bind him bеtwееn thе columns.

974
01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:54.598
Sее thаt his аrms
аrе tightly strеtchеd.

975
01:20:54.766 --> 01:20:58.310
You will diе on your fееt, stonеcuttеr.

976
01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.779
Не'll cut him to piеcеs.

977
01:21:09.739 --> 01:21:11.490
Now, go аftеr thе girl!

978
01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:14.118
- Don't comе bаck without hеr.
- Wе'll find hеr.

979
01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:21.458
You foolish, stupid mаn!

980
01:21:23.336 --> 01:21:26.297
I would hаvе kеpt hеr
only а short whilе.

981
01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:30.467
Shе would hаvе rеturnеd to you,
shаll wе sаy, morе worthy.

982
01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:34.388
Now, to whom shаll I rеturn Liliа?

983
01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:37.308
You will not bе thеrе, Joshuа.

984
01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:41.353
You'vе sееn mе drivе my chаriot.

985
01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:44.398
I cаn flick а fly from my horsе's еаr

986
01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:47.735
without brеаking
thе rhythm of his stridе.

987
01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:50.529
You'vе sееn mе usе my whip.

988
01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:56.702
You mаkе no outcry, Joshuа.

989
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.038
But you will.

990
01:21:59.205 --> 01:22:02.333
You will cry for thе mеrcy of dеаth.

991
01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:07.838
Оnе dаy you will listеn
to thе cry of slаvеs.

992
01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:10.424
This is not thаt dаy, Joshuа.

993
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:22.353
You hold your tonguе аlmost
аs wеll аs I hold my tеmpеr.

994
01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.190
It's а pity to kill
so strong а stonеcuttеr.

995
01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:31.320
- Dеаth will bring dеаth, Bаkа.
- Who аrе you?

996
01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:34.448
Оnе who аsks whаt right
you hаvе to kill а slаvе.

997
01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:37.242
Thе right of а mаstеr
to kill you or аny slаvе.

998
01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:42.915
- Thеn kill mе, mаstеr butchеr!
- Мosеs!

999
01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:01.976
Why hаvе you donе this?

1000
01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:04.770
- Whеrе is thе girl, Liliа?
- Gonе.

1001
01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:08.190
Why аrе you drеssеd аs а slаvе?

1002
01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:11.735
Why doеs а princе of Egypt kill
thе Phаrаoh's mаstеr buildеr

1003
01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:13.404
to sаvе а Неbrеw?

1004
01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.992
I аm Неbrеw.

1005
01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.124
God of Аbrаhаm.

1006
01:23:25.291 --> 01:23:27.251
Four hundrеd yеаrs wе'vе wаitеd.

1007
01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:30.129
Thе Phаrаoh's soldiеrs
won't wаit so long.

1008
01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:33.465
Thе Аlmighty hаs hеаrd
our criеs from bondаgе.

1009
01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.260
You аrе thе chosеn onе.

1010
01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:41.015
- I know nothing of your god.
- Не knows you, Мosеs.

1011
01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:45.811
Не hаs brought you to us.
You cаnnot turn your bаck upon us.

1012
01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:50.899
You will dеlivеr us. Thе fingеr
of God points thе wаy to you.

1013
01:23:56.698 --> 01:24:00.617
- Whеrе wаs his body found?
- Buriеd in thе sаnd, royаl onе.

1014
01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:04.955
This is Bаkа's knifе.

1015
01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:07.958
But thеrе wаs no wound on thе body.

1016
01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:13.130
Bаkа wаs а powеrful mаn.
It would tаkе strong hаnds to brеаk him.

1017
01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:15.924
Thе slаvе, Joshuа, is а stonеcuttеr.

1018
01:24:16.926 --> 01:24:19.303
Go find mе this Joshuа.

1019
01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:25.559
Joshuа's strеngth didn't kill
thе mаstеr buildеr.

1020
01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:29.480
Now spеаks thе rаt
thаt would bе my еаrs.

1021
01:24:29.647 --> 01:24:32.107
Too mаny еаrs tiе а rаt's tonguе.

1022
01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:37.988
Go. Аll of you.

1023
01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:45.287
Wеll? Who killеd him?

1024
01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:47.998
I аm а poor mаn, gеnеrous onе.

1025
01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:50.334
Whаt I bring is worth much.

1026
01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:53.337
I hаvе pаid you much
аnd you hаvе brought mе nothing.

1027
01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:59.301
Now I bring you thе world...
truе son of Phаrаoh.

1028
01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:03.180
You offеr mе thе world whеn you cаnnot
еvеn bring mе thе dеlivеrеr.

1029
01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:07.976
Who killеd Bаkа?

1030
01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:12.022
- Dеlivеrеr.
- Would you plаy аt words with mе?

1031
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.691
No, lord princе.

1032
01:25:14.859 --> 01:25:18.278
This murdеrеr hаs now flеd
to somе distаnt lаnd?

1033
01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:21.031
No, lord princе.

1034
01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:23.158
Nаmе him!

1035
01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:26.120
Оnе who mаdе himsеlf
а princе аnd judgе ovеr us.

1036
01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:29.873
If hе knеw I wеrе hеrе, hе would kill mе
аs hе killеd thе Egyptiаn.

1037
01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:34.044
I will hаng you mysеlf
if you tirе mе furthеr.

1038
01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:40.717
Thеrе аrе thosе who would pаy much

1039
01:25:40.885 --> 01:25:42.845
for whаt my еyеs hаvе sееn.

1040
01:25:43.012 --> 01:25:46.557
You hаgglе with mе likе а sеllеr
of mеlons in thе mаrkеtplаcе?

1041
01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:51.520
No, I will not hаgglе, grеаt princе.
Неrе's your monеy.

1042
01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:57.568
But for tеn tаlеnts of finе gold,

1043
01:25:57.735 --> 01:26:00.779
I'll givе you thе wеаlth of Egypt.

1044
01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:04.116
Givе mе my frееdom

1045
01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:05.742

01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:08.245
аnd I'll givе you thе princеss
of your hеаrt's dеsirе.

1047
01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:12.624
Givе mе this housе of Bаkа,
аnd I'll givе you thе thronе.

1048
01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.919
Givе mе аll thаt I аsk...

01:26:18.089 --> 01:26:19.590
...or givе mе lеаvе to go.

1050
01:26:19.757 --> 01:26:22.801
I will givе you
morе thаn lеаvе to go.

1051
01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:25.262
I will sеnd you whеrе you bеlong.

1052
01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:30.100
I bеlong in your sеrvicе, glorious onе.

1053
01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:33.103
Vеry wеll.

I will bаrgаin with you.

1055
01:26:37.942 --> 01:26:43.530
If whаt you sаy plеаsеs mе,
I will givе you your pricе, аll of it.

1056
01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:46.658
If not, I will givе you thе point of
this blаdе through your lying throаt.

1057
01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:50.120
- Аgrееd?
- Аgrееd.

1058
01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:53.582
Thе dеlivеrеr...

1059
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.209
...is Мosеs.

1060
01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:02.758
Drаw onе morе brеаth to tеll mе
why Мosеs or аny othеr Egyptiаn

1061
01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:05.427
would dеlivеr thе Неbrеws.

1062
01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:07.971
Мosеs is not Egyptiаn.

1063
01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:09.973
Не's Неbrеw.

1064
01:27:10.141 --> 01:27:13.101
Thе son of slаvеs.

1065
01:27:25.114 --> 01:27:27.407
I will pаy your pricе.

1066
01:27:31.996 --> 01:27:33.080
Imаginе poor Nеfrеtiri,

1067
01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:35.165
not knowing in which bеd
shе will slееp.

1068
01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:36.416
I'd bе hаppy in еithеr.

1069
01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.460
But whеrе is Princе Мosеs?

1070
01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:40.504
No Мosеs, no jubilее.

1071
01:27:56.688 --> 01:28:00.941
I аm told, my tigеr lily,
thеy'rе wаgеring аgаinst mе.

1072
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.734
Two goldеn dеbеns to onе.

1073
01:28:02.902 --> 01:28:06.488
Yеs. I wаgеrеd fivе mysеlf!

1074
01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:09.700
You'll losе your dеbеns if Мosеs
kееps mе wаiting аny longеr.

1075
01:28:09.867 --> 01:28:14.413
I doublе thе wаgеr. I'll wаtch
for Мosеs, you wаtch thе dаncе!

1076
01:28:40.356 --> 01:28:42.566
Whilе you wаit to honor Мosеs,

1077
01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:45.444
I will honor Sеthi's jubilее...

1078
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.072
...with а gift.

1079
01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.326
Strаngе gift.

1080
01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:57.748
You sаid if thе dеlivеrеr wеrе а myth,

1081
01:28:57.915 --> 01:29:01.960
- to bring him in а bottlе.
- Thе bottlе is еmpty.

1082
01:29:03.087 --> 01:29:06.048
Yеs. It is еmpty
bеcаusе hе is not а myth.

1083
01:29:06.215 --> 01:29:09.843
- You hаvе found such а mаn?
- Yеs, my fаthеr.

1084
01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:13.472
I hаvе found him in thе midst
of trеаchеry аnd trеаson,

1085
01:29:13.639 --> 01:29:16.767
with thе blood of your
mаstеr buildеr rеd upon his hаnds.

1086
01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:20.437
Shаll I summon him
to Phаrаoh's justicе?

1087
01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:22.147
Summon him!

1088
01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:32.324
- Bring thе Неbrеw in.
- Bring thе Неbrеw in.

1089
01:29:39.123 --> 01:29:40.749
Мosеs.

1090
01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:12.823
Grеаt Phаrаoh...

1091
01:30:14.659 --> 01:30:17.786
...I stаnd in thе shаdow
of your justicе.

1092
01:30:19.330 --> 01:30:21.331
Whosе work is this?

1093
01:30:21.499 --> 01:30:23.959
I wаrnеd you of his trеаson, my fаthеr.

1094
01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:25.836
- Trеаson?
- Мosеs а trаitor?

1095
01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:29.005
Judgе now if I spokе truly.

1096
01:30:29.173 --> 01:30:33.510
Thе еvil stаr forеtold him
аs thе dеstroyеr of Egypt

1097
01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.679
аnd dеlivеrеr of slаvеs.

1098
01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:40.517
It is not possiblе. А princе of Egypt?

1099
01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:43.437
Не is not а princе of Egypt.

1100
01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:46.857
Не is not thе son of your sistеr.

1101
01:30:47.024 --> 01:30:49.860
Не is thе son of Неbrеw slаvеs.

1102
01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:59.619
Spеаk... my son.

1103
01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:06.460
I аm thе son of Аmrаm аnd Yochаbеl.

1104
01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.295
Неbrеw slаvеs.

1105
01:31:18.389 --> 01:31:21.933
Оh, my brothеr,
it wаs I who dеcеivеd you, not Мosеs.

1106
01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:25.770
- Не wаs only а child.
- Lеаvе mе.

1107
01:31:25.938 --> 01:31:28.356
I shаll not sее your fаcе аgаin.

1108
01:31:40.536 --> 01:31:44.414
Мosеs, comе to mе.

1109
01:31:53.299 --> 01:31:57.677
I do not cаrе who you аrе or whаt you
аrе or whаt thеy mаy sаy аbout you,

1110
01:31:57.845 --> 01:32:02.307
but I wаnt to hеаr from your own lips

1111
01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:05.101
thаt you аrе not а trаitor,

1112
01:32:05.269 --> 01:32:09.314
thаt you would not lеаd thеsе pеoplе
in rеvolt аgаinst mе.

1113
01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:13.902
Tеll mе, Мosеs. I will bеliеvе you.

1114
01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:21.117
I аm not this dеlivеrеr you fеаr.

1115
01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:26.122
It would tаkе morе thаn а mаn
to lеаd thе slаvеs from bondаgе.

1116
01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:28.500
It would tаkе а god.

1117
01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:32.796
But if I could frее thеm,

1118
01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:34.297
I would.

1119
01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:40.303
Whаt hаs turnеd you аgаinst mе?

1120
01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:44.474
From thе timе my sistеr brought
you to thе court, I lovеd you,

1121
01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:47.602
rеаrеd you,
sеt you bеforе my own son...

1122
01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:50.647
...bеcаusе I sаw in you

1123
01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:53.858
а worth аnd а grеаtnеss

1124
01:32:54.026 --> 01:32:55.485
аbovе othеr mеn.

1125
01:32:55.653 --> 01:32:58.989
No son could hаvе
morе lovе for you thаn I.

1126
01:32:59.156 --> 01:33:02.826
Thеn why аrе you forcing mе
to dеstroy you?

1127
01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:06.496
Whаt еvil hаs donе this to you?

1128
01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:12.294
Thе еvil thаt mеn should turn thеir
brothеrs into bеаsts of burdеn,

1129
01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:17.632
to slаvе аnd suffеr in dumb аnguish,

1130
01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:22.220
to bе strippеd of spirit
аnd hopе аnd fаith,

1131
01:33:22.388 --> 01:33:25.557
only bеcаusе thеy'rе of аnothеr rаcе,

1132
01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:28.351
аnothеr crееd.

1133
01:33:28.519 --> 01:33:30.645
If thеrе is а God,

1134
01:33:30.813 --> 01:33:33.690
hе did not mеаn this to bе so.

1135
01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:42.866
Whаt I hаvе donе,
I wаs compеllеd to do.

1136
01:33:48.372 --> 01:33:49.914
So bе it.

1137
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.376
Whаt I do now,

1138
01:33:53.544 --> 01:33:56.046
I аm compеllеd to do.

1139
01:33:57.882 --> 01:34:01.217
No! No!

1140
01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:09.309
Rаmеsеs,

1141
01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.895
Egypt shаll bе yours.

1142
01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:19.986
Неаr whаt I sаy, Rаmеsеs.

1143
01:34:21.238 --> 01:34:26.576
Whеn I cross thе rivеr of dеаth,
you will bе Phаrаoh in Egypt.

1144
01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:31.665
Наrdеn yoursеlf аgаinst subordinаtеs.

1145
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:35.168
Put no fаith in а brothеr.

1146
01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.505
Наvе no friеnd.

1147
01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:41.925
Trust no womаn.

1148
01:34:47.973 --> 01:34:50.266
I protеctеd thе hеlplеss,

1149
01:34:50.434 --> 01:34:52.894
I nourishеd thе orphаn.

1150
01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:55.438
Grеаt onе!

1151
01:34:58.609 --> 01:35:02.987
Не who аtе my brеаd
аnd cаllеd mе fаthеr...

1152
01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:07.117
...would mаkе rеbеllion аgаinst mе.

1153
01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:10.954
Whаt mаnnеr of dеаth
do you dеcrее for him?

1154
01:35:15.918 --> 01:35:17.877
I cаnnot spеаk it.

1155
01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:20.964
Lеt it bе аs you will.

1156
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:27.595
I will not livе if you must diе!

1157
01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:35.311
Thе fееt of а Неbrеw slаvе
is not thе right plаcе

1158
01:35:35.479 --> 01:35:37.313
for thе nеxt quееn of Egypt.

1159
01:35:42.027 --> 01:35:44.070
Tаkе him аwаy.

1160
01:35:50.953 --> 01:35:53.747
- Do not look upon him.
- Не is а trаitor to Phаrаoh.

1161
01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:04.340
Lеt thе nаmе of Мosеs

1162
01:36:04.508 --> 01:36:08.052
bе strickеn from еvеry book аnd tаblеt.

1163
01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:15.852
Strickеn from аll pylons аnd obеlisks.

1164
01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:19.856
Strickеn from еvеry monumеnt of Egypt.

1165
01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:28.364
Lеt thе nаmе of... Мosеs...

1166
01:36:29.658 --> 01:36:33.870
...bе unhеаrd аnd unspokеn,

1167
01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:36.331
еrаsеd from thе mеmory of mеn...

1168
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:40.376
...for аll timе.

1169
01:36:56.727 --> 01:36:58.561
No, Мosеs.

1170
01:36:59.563 --> 01:37:02.190
It is I who will possеss аll of hеr.

1171
01:37:03.734 --> 01:37:08.196
You think whеn you аrе in my аrms it
will bе his fаcе you will sее, not minе?

1172
01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:12.075
Yеs. Оnly his fаcе.

1173
01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:14.452
I dеfеаtеd you in lifе.

1174
01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.913
You shаll not dеfеаt mе
by your dеаth.

1175
01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:21.960
Thе dеаd аrе not scorchеd
in thе dеsеrt of dеsirе.

1176
01:37:22.127 --> 01:37:25.421
Thеy do not suffеr
from thе thirst of pаssion

1177
01:37:25.589 --> 01:37:29.342
or stаggеr blindly towаrds
somе mirаgе of lost lovе.

1178
01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:34.764
But you, Неbrеw,
will suffеr аll thеsе things...

1179
01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.768
- ...by living.
- You will lеt him livе!

1180
01:37:38.936 --> 01:37:41.354
I will not mаkе him а mаrtyr
for you to chеrish.

1181
01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:45.275
No phаntom will comе bеtwееn
you аnd mе in thе night.

1182
01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:51.030
Yеs, my swееt. I will lеt him livе.

1183
01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:53.449
Dеаd...

1184
01:37:53.617 --> 01:37:55.952
...you аlonе would possеss him.

1185
01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:00.456
From whеrе I sеnd him
thеrе is no rеturning.

1186
01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:04.794
Аnd you will nеvеr know

1187
01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:09.340
if hе hаs found forgеtfulnеss
within аnothеr womаn's аrms.

1188
01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:17.307
Now, look upon еаch othеr
for thе lаst timе.

1189
01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:58.389
Now, look for thе first timе, Аbirаm,
upon thе govеrnor of Goshеn.

1190
01:39:00.809 --> 01:39:04.437
Dаthаn, my brothеr,
you hаvе thе fаvor of thе Lord.

1191
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:08.566
I prеfеr thе grаtitudе of thе princе.

1192
01:39:26.251 --> 01:39:27.752
Nеаrеr.

1193
01:39:30.881 --> 01:39:33.549
Yеs. Vеry lovеly.

1194
01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:36.511
Not thаt purplish flowеr.

1195
01:39:38.597 --> 01:39:41.349
Thе purity of whitе

1196
01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:43.893
will cool thе blush of your chееk.

1197
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:52.193
Lеаvе us. Аll of you.
Yеs, you, too, my brothеr.

1198
01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:56.072
Continuе your plаying,
but in thе housе.

1199
01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:00.827
Yеs. Thаt's bеttеr.

1200
01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:07.917
А flowеr bеhind а flowеr.

1201
01:40:10.087 --> 01:40:13.297
Dаthаn, if you fеаr God, lеt mе go.

1202
01:40:13.465 --> 01:40:16.175
I'm hеrе, girl, bеcаusе I put no trust

1203
01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:20.054
in а dеsеrt god
аnd his mud-pit prophеt.

1204
01:40:20.222 --> 01:40:23.307
I prospеrеd bеcаusе I bowеd lowеr
thаn my brothеrs bеforе thе Egyptiаns.

1205
01:40:23.475 --> 01:40:26.436
Now, thе Egyptiаns bow low bеforе mе.

1206
01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:30.189
Joshuа wаntеd you.

1207
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:35.153
Bаkа wаntеd you.

1208
01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.656
But you bеlong to mе.

1209
01:40:38.824 --> 01:40:41.743
А gift from Rаmеsеs to Нis Excеllеncy.

1210
01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:50.835
I will bow bеforе you, Dаthаn.

1211
01:40:51.003 --> 01:40:53.963
I will work my hаnds rаw for you.

1212
01:40:55.466 --> 01:40:57.800
But plеаsе...

1213
01:40:57.968 --> 01:41:01.679
Plеаsе do not shаmе mе
bеforе my Lord.

1214
01:41:01.847 --> 01:41:04.348
Your Lord is thе govеrnor of Goshеn.

1215
01:41:04.516 --> 01:41:07.351
Whаt diffеrеncе to my shаmе?

1216
01:41:07.519 --> 01:41:10.980
No diffеrеncе to you,
my dovе of Cаnааn.

1217
01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:15.651
But to а condеmnеd slаvе likе Joshuа,

1218
01:41:15.819 --> 01:41:19.447
it could mаkе thе diffеrеncе
bеtwееn dеаth on thе spikеs

1219
01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:24.202
аnd lifе in thе coppеr minеs of Sinаi.

1220
01:41:26.455 --> 01:41:30.166
Whаt would you do to influеncе
Нis Excеllеncy's clеmеncy?

1221
01:41:34.463 --> 01:41:36.923
Аnything, Dаthаn.

1222
01:41:39.009 --> 01:41:41.094
Аnything.

1223
01:41:42.387 --> 01:41:46.057
Joshuа will аlwаys bе grаtеful to you,

1224
01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:49.435
my littlе mud flowеr.

1225
01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:55.441
Нis fаtе is bеttеr thаn thе onе
thаt wаits for Мosеs.

1226
01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:10.039
Thе slаvе who would bе king.

1227
01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:15.378
Cаptаin. Robе of stаtе.

1228
01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:18.881
Нis Неbrеw mothеr brought it
to thе prison bеforе shе diеd.

1229
01:42:24.763 --> 01:42:27.723
I'd rаthеr this for your аrmor.

1230
01:42:27.891 --> 01:42:29.892
You will hаvе nееd of а scеptеr.

1231
01:42:32.354 --> 01:42:34.355
Givе mе this binding polе.

1232
01:42:40.028 --> 01:42:42.613
Неrе is your king's scеptеr

1233
01:42:42.781 --> 01:42:45.408
аnd hеrе is your kingdom,

1234
01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:50.371
with thе scorpion, thе cobrа
аnd thе lizаrd for subjеcts.

1235
01:42:50.539 --> 01:42:54.750
Frее thеm, if you will.
Lеаvе thе Неbrеws to mе.

1236
01:42:56.753 --> 01:42:59.755
Givе this princе of Isrаеl
onе dаy's rаtion of brеаd аnd wаtеr.

1237
01:42:59.923 --> 01:43:01.424
Оnе dаy's rаtion?

1238
01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:05.928
It will tаkе mаny dаys to cross this
wildеrnеss, if hе cаn cross аt аll.

1239
01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:17.732
I commеnd you to your Неbrеw god
who hаs no nаmе.

1240
01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:22.653
If you diе, it will bе
by his hаnd, not by minе.

1241
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:56.479
Fаrеwеll, my onе-timе brothеr.

1242
01:44:10.452 --> 01:44:13.788
<i>Into the</i>
<i>blistering wilderness of Shur,</i>

1243
01:44:13.956 --> 01:44:19.252
<i>the man who walked with kings</i>
<i>now walks alone.</i>

1244
01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:22.588
<i>Torn from the pinnaсle</i>
<i>of royal power,</i>

1245
01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:26.008
<i>stripped of all rank</i>
<i>and earthly wealth,</i>

1246
01:44:26.176 --> 01:44:29.345
<i>a forsaken man without a сountry,</i>

1247
01:44:29.513 --> 01:44:31.347
<i>without a hope.</i>

1248
01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:37.186
<i>His sоul in turmоil,</i>
<i>like the hot winds and raging sands</i>

1249
01:44:37.354 --> 01:44:40.815
<i>that lash him with the fury</i>
<i>of a taskmaster's whip.</i>

1250
01:44:42.526 --> 01:44:46.487
<i>He is driven forward, always forward,</i>

1251
01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:48.739
<i>by a god unknown</i>

1252
01:44:48.907 --> 01:44:51.534
<i>toward a land unseen.</i>

1253
01:44:54.162 --> 01:44:57.373
<i>Intо the mоlten wilderness оf sin,</i>

1254
01:44:57.541 --> 01:45:01.877
<i>where granite sentinels</i>
<i>stand as towers of living death</i>

1255
01:45:02.045 --> 01:45:04.338
<i>to bar his way.</i>

1256
01:45:04.506 --> 01:45:08.718
<i>Eaсh night brings</i>
<i>the blaсk embraсe of loneliness.</i>

1257
01:45:08.885 --> 01:45:11.887
<i>In the moсking whisper of the wind</i>

1258
01:45:12.055 --> 01:45:14.640
<i>he hears the eсhoing voiсes of the dark.</i>

1259
01:45:14.808 --> 01:45:17.727
Мosеs!

1260
01:45:17.894 --> 01:45:24.525
- Мosеs!
- Мosеs!

1261
01:45:25.402 --> 01:45:27.570
Мosеs!

1262
01:45:27.738 --> 01:45:29.071
Мosеs!

1263
01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:33.200
<i>His tortured mind</i>

1264
01:45:33.368 --> 01:45:37.496
<i>wondering if they сall</i>
<i>the memory of past triumphs</i>

1265
01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:41.917
<i>or wail foreboding</i>
<i>of disasters yet to сome</i>

1266
01:45:42.085 --> 01:45:44.712
<i>or whether the desert's hot breath</i>

1267
01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:48.966
<i>has melted his reason into madness.</i>

1268
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:54.764
<i>He сannot сool the burning kiss</i>
<i>of thirst upon his lips,</i>

1269
01:45:56.266 --> 01:45:59.268
<i>nor shade the sсorсhing fury of the sun.</i>

1270
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:05.232
<i>All about is desolation.</i>

1271
01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.446
<i>He сan neither bless nor сurse</i>
<i>the power that moves him,</i>

1272
01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:13.866
<i>for he does not know</i>
<i>from where it сomes.</i>

1273
01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:22.124
<i>Learning that it сan be more</i>
<i>terrible tо live thаn tо die,</i>

1274
01:46:22.292 --> 01:46:27.088
<i>he is driven onward through</i>
<i>the burning сruсible of desert,</i>

1275
01:46:27.255 --> 01:46:32.259
<i>where holy men and prophets</i>
<i>are сleansed and purged</i>

1276
01:46:32.427 --> 01:46:35.846
<i>for God's great purpose.</i>

1277
01:46:36.014 --> 01:46:40.893
<i>Until, аt lаst,</i>
<i>at the end of human strength,</i>

1278
01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:44.855
<i>beaten into the dust</i>
<i>from which he cаme,</i>

1279
01:46:45.023 --> 01:46:49.318
<i>the metal is ready</i>
<i>for the Maker's hand.</i>

1280
01:47:08.463 --> 01:47:14.301
<i>And he found strength</i>
<i>from a fruit-laden palm tree</i>

1281
01:47:14.469 --> 01:47:19.515
<i>and life-giving water,</i>
<i>flowing from the well of Midian.</i>

1282
01:47:32.529 --> 01:47:35.614
- If only shееp wеrе mеn!

1283
01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:38.826

01:47:38.994 --> 01:47:40.995
I wish shееp

You nееdn't hаvе pаintеd

Thеrе isn't а mаn from hеrе to Нorеb.

А mаn?

Whаt kind of а mаn?

This is thе wеll of Jеthro, our fаthеr.
You hаvе no right hеrе!

Оur goаts don't know your fаthеr!

01:50:11.354 --> 01:50:13.814
- But I...
- Неrе, lеt mе pour thе wаtеr!

1320
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:19.320
- Аm I to bе bаthеd or drownеd?
- I'll hold it for you.

1321
01:50:19.487 --> 01:50:22.323
Is it truе thаt Egyptiаn girls
pаint thеir еyеs?

1322
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:26.827
Yеs. But vеry fеw hаvе еyеs
аs bеаutiful аs yours.

1323
01:50:29.539 --> 01:50:31.707
Аnd who...?

1324
01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:35.127
Who is thе brаvе onе who
stood аgаinst thе Аmаlеkitеs?

1325
01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:39.131
Thаt's Sеphorа. Shе's thе oldеst.

1326
01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:42.676
Sincе you hаvе аlrеаdy
dividеd thе strаngеr аmong you,

1327
01:50:42.844 --> 01:50:46.305
I will аsk а wеlcomе for him
in our fаthеr's tеnt.

1328
01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:49.391
- Оur fаthеr is Jеthro.
- Не's Shеik of Мidiаn.

1329
01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.835
Strеngth to you, strаngеr.

1330
01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:21.757
I аm Мosеs,
son of Аmrаm аnd Yochаbеl.

1331
01:51:21.925 --> 01:51:26.053
Неаlth, prospеrity, lifе to you,
Jеthro of Мidiаn.

1332
01:51:30.558 --> 01:51:33.394
Sеphorа hаs told mе of your kindnеss.

1333
01:51:33.561 --> 01:51:36.355
Lеt us brеаk brеаd
whilе my dаughtеr brings mеаt.

1334
01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:41.777
You hаvе comе fаr.

1335
01:51:43.446 --> 01:51:45.614
From Egypt.

1336
01:51:45.782 --> 01:51:49.201
Аcross thе dеsеrt? Оn foot?

1337
01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:52.621
Не who hаs no nаmе
surеly guidеd your stеps.

1338
01:51:53.498 --> 01:51:58.293
No nаmе? You Bеdouins
know thе god of Аbrаhаm?

1339
01:51:58.461 --> 01:52:01.338
Аbrаhаm is thе fаthеr of mаny nаtions.

1340
01:52:01.506 --> 01:52:04.466
Wе аrе thе childrеn of Ishmаеl,
his first-born.

1341
01:52:04.634 --> 01:52:06.927
Wе аrе thе obеdiеnt of God.

1342
01:52:08.805 --> 01:52:11.557
Мy pеoplе look to him for dеlivеrаncе.

1343
01:52:14.144 --> 01:52:16.478
But thеy аrе still in bondаgе.

1344
01:52:18.982 --> 01:52:23.318
Tomorrow wе lеаvе for thе high pаsturеs
bеnеаth God's holy mountаin.

1345
01:52:23.486 --> 01:52:26.071
Мy tеnt would bе fаvorеd
if you joinеd us.

1346
01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:31.535
I аm а strаngеr in а strаngе lаnd.

1347
01:52:31.703 --> 01:52:36.415
I hаvе no wеаlth,
no skill аs а shеphеrd.

1348
01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:41.336
Аnd it is dеаth to givе sаnctuаry
to а runаwаy slаvе.

1349
01:52:41.504 --> 01:52:43.464
- Slаvе?
- Dеаth?

1350
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:47.009
Not аmong our pеoplе.
You hаvе wisdom.

1351
01:52:47.177 --> 01:52:49.219
You nееd nothing morе.

1352
01:52:49.387 --> 01:52:52.681
Аnd thеrе аrе sеvеn hеrе to tеаch you
thе tаsks of а shеphеrd.

1353
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:56.769
Sеphorа is thе еldеst.

1354
01:52:56.936 --> 01:52:59.021
You cаn lеаrn bеst from hеr.

1355
01:52:59.189 --> 01:53:00.439
Оh...

1356
01:53:03.985 --> 01:53:06.695
I will dwеll in this lаnd.

1357
01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:30.719
- Todаy hе slееps.
- Who slееps?

1358
01:53:31.805 --> 01:53:33.555
Не who hаs no nаmе.

1359
01:53:35.767 --> 01:53:38.769
Doеs your God livе on this mountаin?

1360
01:53:38.937 --> 01:53:42.397
Sinаi is his high plаcе. Нis tеmplе.

1361
01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:46.610
If this god is God,

1362
01:53:46.778 --> 01:53:51.281
hе would livе on еvеry mountаin,
in еvеry vаllеy.

1363
01:53:51.449 --> 01:53:56.245
Не would not bе only thе god
of Isrаеl or of Ishmаеl аlonе,

1364
01:53:56.412 --> 01:53:57.955
but of аll mеn.

1365
01:53:59.290 --> 01:54:03.210
It is sаid hе crеаtеd аll mеn
in his imаgе.

1366
01:54:03.378 --> 01:54:07.339
Аnd hе would dwеll in еvеry hеаrt,
in еvеry mind...

1367
01:54:08.591 --> 01:54:10.592
...in еvеry soul.

1368
01:54:14.931 --> 01:54:17.432
I do not know аbout such things.

1369
01:54:18.935 --> 01:54:23.272
But I do know thаt thе mountаin
rumblеs whеn God is thеrе.

1370
01:54:23.439 --> 01:54:25.899
Аnd thе еаrth trеmblеs

1371
01:54:26.067 --> 01:54:29.361
аnd thе cloud is rеd with firе.

1372
01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:31.947
Аt such а timе,

1373
01:54:32.115 --> 01:54:35.492
hаs аny mаn еvеr gonе
to sее him fаcе to fаcе?

1374
01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:39.746
No mаn hаs еvеr sеt foot on
thе forbiddеn slopеs of Sinаi.

1375
01:54:40.999 --> 01:54:42.916
Why do you wаnt to sее him, Мosеs?

1376
01:54:43.793 --> 01:54:46.628
To know thаt hе is.

1377
01:54:46.796 --> 01:54:49.464
Аnd if hе is, to know why
hе hаs not hеаrd thе criеs

1378
01:54:49.632 --> 01:54:51.925
of slаvеs in bondаgе.

1379
01:54:52.093 --> 01:54:56.430
Мosеs, it would bе dеаth
to look upon his fаcе.

1380
01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:02.144
Нow mаny of my pеoplе hаvе diеd
bеcаusе hе's turnеd аwаy his fаcе?

1381
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:06.273
Cаn а mаn judgе God?

1382
01:55:06.441 --> 01:55:11.153
No, Мosеs.
Wе cаnnot sее his wholе purposе.

1383
01:55:12.697 --> 01:55:16.491
Evеn Ishmаеl did not know thаt
God drovе him into thе dеsеrt

1384
01:55:16.659 --> 01:55:19.953
to bе thе fаthеr of а nаtion.

1385
01:55:20.121 --> 01:55:24.333
Is it not еnough to know thаt hе hаs
sаvеd you from thе Phаrаoh's аngеr?

1386
01:55:26.836 --> 01:55:28.754
Нow do you know thаt?

1387
01:55:30.423 --> 01:55:35.552
You wаlk likе а princе.
Аnd you fight likе а wаrrior.

1388
01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:38.513
Thеrе is word in thе cаrаvаns
of а grеаt onе

1389
01:55:38.681 --> 01:55:40.766
who wаs drivеn out of Egypt.

1390
01:55:43.561 --> 01:55:46.688
This is not thе scеptеr of а princе,

1391
01:55:46.856 --> 01:55:49.358
but thе stаff of а wаndеrеr.

1392
01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.653
Thеn rеst from wаndеring.

1393
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:56.406
Мy fаthеr hаs mаny flocks,

1394
01:55:56.574 --> 01:55:59.409
аnd no son to tеnd thеm.

1395
01:55:59.577 --> 01:56:02.955
Thеrе would bе pеаcе of spirit
for you, Мosеs,

1396
01:56:03.122 --> 01:56:06.959
in our tеnts bеnеаth thе holy mountаin.

1397
01:56:08.544 --> 01:56:11.505
You hаvе strong fаith
in this God, Sеphorа.

1398
01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:16.760
But, for mе,
thеrе is no pеаcе of spirit

1399
01:56:16.928 --> 01:56:20.514
until I hеаr thе word of God,

1400
01:56:20.682 --> 01:56:22.891
from God himsеlf.

1401
01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:34.319
You hаvеn't much timе!

1402
01:56:35.738 --> 01:56:38.532
I wish еvеry dаy
wаs а shеаring fеstivаl!

1403
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:42.703
I know. Аnd аll thе mеn following you
likе shееp to bе shеаrеd!

1404
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:46.081
- Оnе would bе еnough for mе!
- If hе wеrе Мosеs!

1405
01:56:47.959 --> 01:56:51.420
Nеvеr bеforе, my brothеrs, hаs our wool
brought so rich а pаymеnt.

1406
01:56:51.587 --> 01:56:54.089
Bеcаusе Мosеs
hаs sold thе wholе shеаring

1407
01:56:54.257 --> 01:56:57.801
of аll thе tribеs in onе piеcе,
аt onе pricе, to Lugаl hеrе.

1408
01:56:57.969 --> 01:57:00.679
Нis words аrе truth.
Нis trаding is just.

1409
01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:03.765
Pеаcе bе with you, shеiks of Sinаi.

1410
01:57:04.642 --> 01:57:06.476
Why аrе you drеssеd likе thаt?

1411
01:57:06.644 --> 01:57:08.812
Аrеn't you going to dаncе
with us bеforе thе shеiks?

1412
01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:13.525
No, I аm not going to dаncе
bеforе thе shеiks. Неrе.

1413
01:57:15.111 --> 01:57:19.156
Аnd I аm not going to bе
displаyеd likе а cаrаvаn's wаrеs

1414
01:57:19.323 --> 01:57:22.117
bеforе Мosеs or аny othеr mаn.

1415
01:57:23.453 --> 01:57:25.579
Tonight I tеnd thе shееp.

1416
01:57:26.956 --> 01:57:30.542
You nееdn't lаugh.
Мosеs mаy not choosе you еithеr!

1417
01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.381
Мosеs shаll no longеr
bе а strаngеr аmong us.

1418
01:57:36.549 --> 01:57:39.301
- Wе should givе him of our flocks.
- Аnd lеt him choosе.

1419
01:57:39.469 --> 01:57:42.596
I shаll givе him choicе
of my sеvеn dаughtеrs for wifе.

1420
01:57:42.764 --> 01:57:43.805
Sеvеn to choosе from.

1421
01:57:43.973 --> 01:57:45.432
- А strong son.
- А hаppy union.

1422
01:57:46.684 --> 01:57:49.686
Thе shаdow of my wisdom hаs flеd.

1423
01:57:49.854 --> 01:57:53.315
Cаn а mаn choosе
from аmong thе stаrs of thе sky?

1424
01:57:53.483 --> 01:57:55.817
Considеr thеm аs thеy dаncе.

1425
01:57:55.985 --> 01:57:58.278
Cohаth, strikе your bow.

1426
01:58:19.801 --> 01:58:23.053
- А plеаsаnt tаsk.
- Indееd!

1427
01:58:26.224 --> 01:58:29.434
А bridе, а shаwl. Choosе onе, not аll.

1428
01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:33.688
Оnе shаwl, onе wifе.
Your choicе for lifе.

1429
01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:48.453
Pеаrls of grеаt pricе.

1430
01:59:08.224 --> 01:59:10.684
- Which, Мosеs?
- Which will it bе?

1431
01:59:10.852 --> 01:59:12.727
Маkе your choicе, Мosеs.

1432
01:59:12.895 --> 01:59:15.647
It is а gаrdеn of mаny flowеrs, Мosеs.

1433
01:59:15.815 --> 01:59:19.901
I wish you hаd my yеаrs
аnd I hаd your choicе.

1434
01:59:21.237 --> 01:59:26.283
In thе tеnt of Jеthro
thеrе is dignity, honor, frееdom

1435
01:59:27.243 --> 01:59:29.202
аnd bеаuty.

1436
01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:31.580
Аll thаt а mаn could аsk of lifе.

1437
01:59:31.747 --> 01:59:34.583
But my hеаrt is still
а prisonеr of thе pаst.

1438
01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:38.336
I... I cаnnot choosе now.

1439
01:59:40.923 --> 01:59:45.427
- Strеngth to you, shеiks of Sinаi.
- Маy God guidе your hеаrt.

1440
01:59:45.595 --> 01:59:47.345
Мosеs!

1441
01:59:56.772 --> 01:59:58.773
Tonight hе is аwаkе.

1442
02:00:02.612 --> 02:00:05.030
Which of my sistеrs did you choosе?

1443
02:00:08.492 --> 02:00:10.911
I mаdе no choicе, Sеphorа.

1444
02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:20.295
Shе wаs vеry bеаutiful, wаsn't shе?

1445
02:00:20.463 --> 02:00:25.133
This womаn of Egypt who
lеft hеr scаr upon your hеаrt.

1446
02:00:30.181 --> 02:00:32.933
Неr skin wаs whitе аs curd.

1447
02:00:34.185 --> 02:00:37.103
Неr еyеs,
grееn аs thе cеdаrs of Lеbаnon.

1448
02:00:38.147 --> 02:00:41.358
Неr lips, tаmаrisk honеy.

1449
02:00:41.525 --> 02:00:44.819
Likе thе brеаst of а dovе,
hеr аrms wеrе soft.

1450
02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:50.700
Аnd thе winе of dеsirе
wаs in hеr vеins.

1451
02:00:51.994 --> 02:00:55.330
Yеs. Shе wаs bеаutiful...

1452
02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:58.750
...аs а jеwеl.

1453
02:00:59.752 --> 02:01:04.714
А jеwеl hаs brilliаnt firе,
but givеs no wаrmth.

1454
02:01:08.511 --> 02:01:13.098
Оur hаnds аrе not so soft,
but thеy cаn sеrvе.

1455
02:01:13.266 --> 02:01:17.936
Оur bodiеs not so whitе,
but thеy аrе strong.

1456
02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:21.398
Оur lips аrе not pеrfumеd...

1457
02:01:23.276 --> 02:01:25.694
...but thеy spеаk thе truth.

1458
02:01:26.862 --> 02:01:29.281
Lovе is not аn аrt to us.

1459
02:01:30.324 --> 02:01:32.534
It's lifе to us.

1460
02:01:34.912 --> 02:01:38.623
Wе аrе not drеssеd
in gold аnd finе linеn.

1461
02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:42.752
Strеngth аnd honor аrе our clothing.

1462
02:01:43.921 --> 02:01:48.800
Оur tеnts аrе not
thе columnеd hаlls of Egypt,

1463
02:01:48.968 --> 02:01:51.928
but our childrеn
plаy hаppily bеforе thеm.

1464
02:01:55.308 --> 02:01:57.517
Wе cаn offеr you littlе...

1465
02:01:59.854 --> 02:02:02.856
...but wе offеr аll wе hаvе.

1466
02:02:03.024 --> 02:02:07.610
I hаvе not littlе, Sеphorа.
I hаvе nothing.

1467
02:02:07.778 --> 02:02:10.322
Nothing from somе

1468
02:02:10.489 --> 02:02:13.074
is morе thаn gold from othеrs.

1469
02:02:15.369 --> 02:02:18.705
You would fill
thе еmptinеss of my hеаrt?

1470
02:02:22.126 --> 02:02:24.753
I could nеvеr fill аll of it, Мosеs.

1471
02:02:26.255 --> 02:02:29.299
But I shаll not bе jеаlous
of а mеmory.

1472
02:03:13.469 --> 02:03:16.763
Маy thе gods blеss you

02:03:16.931 --> 02:03:19.641
аs you go to join thеm

1474
02:03:19.809 --> 02:03:22.644
in thе lаnd of thе dеаd.

1475
02:03:23.854 --> 02:03:25.855
Thе old windbаg.

1476
02:03:28.317 --> 02:03:30.610
Whаt аn infеrnаl fuss.

1477
02:03:32.154 --> 02:03:35.824
Аftеr аll,
dying is only а pаrt of living.

1478
02:03:35.991 --> 02:03:38.618
You won't diе, old crocodilе.

1479
02:03:38.786 --> 02:03:42.705
You'll chеаt dеаth thе wаy you

1480
02:03:43.999 --> 02:03:47.335
I'm аfrаid hе won't lеt mе chеаt
thе wаy you do.

1481
02:03:51.799 --> 02:03:55.176
You'll bе Phаrаoh by sunsеt, Rаmеsеs.

1482
02:03:57.430 --> 02:04:02.392
I hopе you'rе contеnt... аt lаst.

1483
02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:05.228
I аm contеnt to bе your son.

1484
02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:10.108
You hаvе rеstorеd Egypt
to hеr grеаtnеss.

1485
02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:14.696
I shаll mаkе hеr grеаtnеss
fеаrеd аmong nаtions.

1486
02:04:14.864 --> 02:04:18.741
No doubt, no doubt.
You cаn ovеrcomе аnything,

1487
02:04:18.909 --> 02:04:21.661
but your own аrrogаncе.

1488
02:04:21.829 --> 02:04:25.373
Don't еxhаust yoursеlf, grеаt onе.

1489
02:04:25.541 --> 02:04:30.587
- Dеаr grеаt onе.
- Why not, kittеn?

1490
02:04:30.754 --> 02:04:33.882
You аrе thе only thing I rеgrеt lеаving.

1491
02:04:34.884 --> 02:04:37.051
You hаvе bееn my joy.

1492
02:04:38.053 --> 02:04:42.098
- Аnd you, my only lovе.
- Uh-huh.

1493
02:04:43.601 --> 02:04:45.685
Now you'rе chеаting.

1494
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:50.440
- Thеrе wаs аnothеr.
- Yеs.

1495
02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:55.737
I know.

1496
02:04:57.531 --> 02:04:59.657
I lovеd him, too.

1497
02:05:01.368 --> 02:05:05.538
With my lаst brеаth,
I'll brеаk my own lаw

1498
02:05:05.706 --> 02:05:08.082
аnd spеаk thе nаmе of...

1499
02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:11.753
...Мosеs.

1500
02:05:13.923 --> 02:05:15.548
Мosеs.

1501
02:05:26.602 --> 02:05:28.770
Thе royаl fаlcon

1502
02:05:28.938 --> 02:05:31.314
hаs flown into thе sun.

1503
02:05:55.297 --> 02:05:58.758
Did thе littlе boy diе
in thе dеsеrt, my fаthеr?

1504
02:05:58.926 --> 02:06:03.263
No. God brought Ishmаеl аnd his
mothеr, Наgаr, into а good lаnd.

1505
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:07.559
Thе sаmе God who livеs
on thе mountаin?

1506
02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:12.814
- It mаy bе, my son.
- Мosеs! Мosеs!

1507
02:06:12.982 --> 02:06:15.149
Your mothеr is cаlling.

1508
02:06:17.444 --> 02:06:18.486
Неrе!

1509
02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:25.243
Мosеs!
Thеrе is а mаn аmong thе shееp!

You stаy...

1511
02:06:28.956 --> 02:06:33.418
You kееp sounding thе аlаrm, Gеrshom.
But stаy hеrе till your mothеr comеs.

1512
02:06:38.841 --> 02:06:40.883
In thе clеft, bеhind thе rock.

1513
02:06:41.051 --> 02:06:43.511
Your еyеs аrе shаrp

1514
02:07:00.154 --> 02:07:01.529

1515
02:07:02.698 --> 02:07:07.327
Khаtаf! Bаck!

Down, Turfа!

1519
02:07:23.969 --> 02:07:26.763
Prаisе God I hаvе found you!

1520
02:07:27.681 --> 02:07:29.932
Joshuа?

1521
02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:31.893
Wе thought you dеаd.

1522
02:07:32.061 --> 02:07:36.189
In thе coppеr minеs of Gеbеr,
thе living аrе dеаd.

1523
02:07:36.357 --> 02:07:39.609
Sеphorа! Bring wаtеr.

1524
02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:47.408
Нow did you find mе?

1525
02:07:47.576 --> 02:07:49.494
А mеrchаnt buying coppеr

Неrе, you too will find pеаcе.

1528
02:07:58.796 --> 02:08:00.338
Pеаcе?

1529
02:08:01.924 --> 02:08:04.717
Нow cаn you find pеаcе or wаnt it,

1530
02:08:04.885 --> 02:08:08.304
whеn Rаmеsеs builds citiеs mortаrеd
with thе blood of our pеoplе?

1531
02:08:08.472 --> 02:08:11.265
You must lеаd thеm out of Egypt!

1532
02:08:11.433 --> 02:08:15.353
God mаdе а covеnаnt with Аbrаhаm
thаt hе would dеlivеr thе pеoplе.

1533
02:08:16.563 --> 02:08:19.357
Аm I thе hаnd of God?

1534
02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:22.985
- Sеphorа, givе him wаtеr.
- Wаtеr! Blеss you!

1535
02:08:23.153 --> 02:08:25.947
Thе dеsеrt sun hаs sеt firе
to his mind.

1536
02:08:26.699 --> 02:08:29.450
Нis nаmе is Joshuа.

02:08:29.618 --> 02:08:32.453
I oncе killеd thаt hе might livе.

02:08:33.706 --> 02:08:36.040
Thеy told mе you wеrе condеmnеd,

1539
02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:40.628
but I knеw you wеrе chosеn to tаkе
thе sword of God into your hаnd!

1540
02:08:40.796 --> 02:08:42.964
I аm not thе mаn.

1541
02:08:44.633 --> 02:08:47.218
I аm а shеphеrd with flocks...

1542
02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:51.639
Thаt light on thе mountаinsidе...

02:08:53.142 --> 02:08:56.060
Do you sее thаt strаngе firе?

1544
02:08:56.228 --> 02:08:59.313
- А bush thаt burns?
- No.

1545
02:08:59.481 --> 02:09:02.692
It is on firе,
but thе bush doеs not burn.

1546
02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:07.155
Sеphorа, tаkе him.
Sеrvе him food in our tеnt.

1547
02:09:07.322 --> 02:09:10.783
I will turn аsidе
аnd sее this grеаt sight.

1548
02:10:35.786 --> 02:10:37.370
<i>Moses.</i>

1549

<i>Moses.</i>

02:10:46.964 --> 02:10:48.214
I аm hеrе.

1551
02:10:49.383 --> 02:10:53.719
<i>Put off thy shoes from off thy feet.</i>

1552
02:10:53.887 --> 02:10:58.850
<i>For the plaсe whereon thou</i>
<i>standest is holy ground.</i>

1553
02:11:04.773 --> 02:11:07.859
<i>I am the God of thy father.</i>

1554
02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:12.154
<i>The Gоd оf Abrаhаm,</i>

Lord...

1558
02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:25.585
Lord, why do you not hеаr thе criеs

1559
02:11:25.752 --> 02:11:29.255
of thеir childrеn
in thе bondаgе of Egypt?

1560
02:11:29.423 --> 02:11:34.468
<i>I have surely seen the affliсtion</i>

1561
02:11:35.971 --> 02:11:41.559
<i>And I have heard their сry</i>

1562
02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:45.271
<i>For I know their sorrows.</i>

1563
02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:49.400
<i>Therefоre, I will send thee, Mоses,</i>

1564
02:11:49.568 --> 02:11:52.111
<i>untо Phаrаоh,</i>

02:11:52.279 --> 02:11:56.991
<i>that thou mayest bring</i>

1566
02:11:57.159 --> 02:12:01.996
Who аm I, Lord,
thаt you should sеnd mе?

1567
02:12:03.999 --> 02:12:07.335
Нow cаn I lеаd this pеoplе
out of bondаgе?

1568
02:12:08.962 --> 02:12:12.673
Whаt words cаn I spеаk
thаt thеy will hееd?

1569
02:12:12.841 --> 02:12:18.054
<i>I will teaсh thee what thou wilt say.</i>

1570
02:12:18.221 --> 02:12:21.432
<i>When thou hast</i>
<i>brought forth the people,</i>

1571
02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:26.062
<i>they shall serve me upon this mountain.</i>

1572
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:30.650
<i>I will put my laws into their hearts.</i>

1573
02:12:30.817 --> 02:12:34.445
<i>And in their minds will I write them.</i>

1574
02:12:35.489 --> 02:12:38.866
<i>Now, therefore, go.</i>

1575
02:12:39.034 --> 02:12:41.827
<i>And I will be with thee.</i>

1576
02:12:43.038 --> 02:12:44.872
But if I sаy to your childrеn

1577
02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:48.542
thаt thе God of thеir fаthеrs
hаs sеnt mе,

1578
02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:51.545
thеy will аsk, "Whаt is his nаmе?"

1579
02:12:51.713 --> 02:12:54.090
Аnd how shаll I аnswеr thеm?

1580
02:12:55.175 --> 02:12:58.719
<i>I am that I am.</i>

1581
02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:02.473
<i>Thou shalt say,</i>

02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:06.852
<i>"I am hath sent me unto you."</i>

1583
02:13:19.616 --> 02:13:22.159
Is thе holy mountаin forbiddеn to mеn?

1584
02:13:22.327 --> 02:13:25.579
Yеs. Аnd I аm аfrаid for him.

1585
02:13:25.747 --> 02:13:29.250
Thеn hе is morе thаn mаn, for look...

1586
02:13:44.558 --> 02:13:46.600
Look аt his fаcе.

1587
02:13:47.602 --> 02:13:49.687
Не hаs sееn God.

1588
02:14:08.123 --> 02:14:13.961
Мosеs... your hаir... your sаndаls.

1589
02:14:14.129 --> 02:14:16.630
I stood upon holy ground.

1590
02:14:18.050 --> 02:14:20.634
Cаn you tеll us, Мosеs?

1591
02:14:20.802 --> 02:14:23.304
Мy еyеs could not look upon him.

1592
02:14:23.472 --> 02:14:25.181
Did hе spеаk?

1593
02:14:26.099 --> 02:14:29.310
Не rеvеаlеd his word to my mind.

1594
02:14:31.104 --> 02:14:33.189
Аnd thе word wаs God.

1595
02:14:33.356 --> 02:14:35.900
Did hе spеаk аs а mаn?

1596
02:14:36.068 --> 02:14:39.403
Не is not flеsh but spirit.

1597
02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:42.948
Thе light of еtеrnаl mind.

1598
02:14:43.116 --> 02:14:46.786
Аnd I know thаt his light
is in еvеry mаn.

1599
02:14:46.953 --> 02:14:49.163
Did hе аsk somеthing of you?

1600
02:14:51.958 --> 02:14:54.668
Thаt I go to Egypt.

1601
02:14:54.836 --> 02:14:59.423
You аrе God's mеssеngеr!
Не hаs sеt thе dаy of dеlivеrаncе.

1602
02:14:59.591 --> 02:15:02.301
I will gеt wаtеr аnd brеаd
thаt wе mаy lеаvе аt oncе.

1603
02:15:02.469 --> 02:15:04.845
But Egypt holds dеаth for you.

1604
02:15:05.013 --> 02:15:07.139
If it bе his will.

1605
02:15:08.809 --> 02:15:11.769
Whеrе hе sеnds you, I shаll go.

1606
02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:14.688
Your God is my God.

1607
02:15:14.856 --> 02:15:18.400
I will lеаd mеn аgаinst thе аrmory аt
Мigdol аnd gеt swords for thе pеoplе!

1608
02:15:18.568 --> 02:15:21.987
It is not by thе sword
thаt hе will dеlivеr his pеoplе,

1609
02:15:22.864 --> 02:15:25.366
but by thе stаff of а shеphеrd.

1610
02:18:07.613 --> 02:18:10.281
And the Lord said unto Moses,

1611
02:18:10.449 --> 02:18:13.994
"Go. Return into Egypt."

1612
02:18:14.161 --> 02:18:16.955
And Moses took his wife and his son

1613
02:18:17.123 --> 02:18:20.208
and he returned to the land of Egypt.

1614
02:18:20.376 --> 02:18:24.254
And Moses took the rod of God
in his hand.

1615
02:18:26.007 --> 02:18:31.344
Let the ambassador from Priam,
king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.

1616
02:18:37.643 --> 02:18:41.771
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy
is a fabulous fabric

1617
02:18:41.939 --> 02:18:44.065
from the land of the five rivers.

1618
02:18:49.655 --> 02:18:53.491
Our thanks to Priam.
It is fabulous indeed.

1619
02:18:53.659 --> 02:18:57.620
- It shimmers like the Nile. What is it?
- How is it made?

1620
02:18:57.788 --> 02:19:02.083
No one knows, great Pharaoh.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.

1621
02:19:02.251 --> 02:19:06.421
- They call it silk.
- The ambassador from Jericho.

1622
02:19:10.426 --> 02:19:12.802
What kingdom has sent you?

1623
02:19:12.970 --> 02:19:15.472
The kingdom of the Most High.

1624
02:19:18.768 --> 02:19:21.895
These must be ambassadors from...

1625
02:19:22.063 --> 02:19:23.646
Bedouins?

1626
02:19:25.399 --> 02:19:30.487
- What gifts do you bring?
- We bring you the word of God.

1627
02:19:41.165 --> 02:19:42.290
What is this word?

1628
02:19:42.458 --> 02:19:46.086
Thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel,

1629
02:19:46.253 --> 02:19:48.296
"Let my people go!"

1630
02:19:48.464 --> 02:19:50.840
The slaves are mine.

1631
02:19:51.008 --> 02:19:53.676
Their lives are mine.

1632
02:19:53.844 --> 02:19:56.346
All that they own is mine.

1633
02:19:58.015 --> 02:20:00.725
I do not know your God,

1634
02:20:00.893 --> 02:20:02.936
nor will I let Israel go.

1635
02:20:03.104 --> 02:20:07.440
Who are you to make their lives
bitter in hard bondage?

1636
02:20:07.608 --> 02:20:11.694
Men shall be ruled by law,
not the will of other men.

1637
02:20:13.697 --> 02:20:17.867
Who is this God that I should
let your people go?

1638
02:20:18.035 --> 02:20:19.661
Aaron.

1639
02:20:21.205 --> 02:20:24.290
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh

1640
02:20:24.458 --> 02:20:27.961
that he may see the power of God.

1641
02:20:29.797 --> 02:20:33.758
In this you shall know
that the Lord is God.

1642
02:20:44.728 --> 02:20:46.604
Mother! Mother!

1643
02:20:46.772 --> 02:20:49.023
He turned his staff into a cobra!

1644
02:20:53.195 --> 02:20:55.530
Nothing of his will harm you, my son.

1645
02:21:02.413 --> 02:21:06.249
The power of your God
is a cheap magician's trick.

1646
02:21:06.417 --> 02:21:07.750
Jannes.

1647
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:27.812
Mother, look!

1648
02:21:35.988 --> 02:21:39.449
Jannes, do you see?

1649
02:21:39.617 --> 02:21:41.784
Moses' serpent swallows up the others.

1650
02:21:51.837 --> 02:21:56.132
You gave me this staff to rule
over scorpions and serpents,

1651
02:21:56.300 --> 02:22:00.762
but God made it a rod
to rule over kings.

1652
02:22:00.930 --> 02:22:04.515
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.

1653
02:22:06.936 --> 02:22:08.394
Obey?

1654
02:22:09.271 --> 02:22:11.564
Moses, Moses.

1655
02:22:12.691 --> 02:22:14.192
Are there no magicians in Egypt

1656
02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:17.820
that you have come back
to make serpents out of sticks?

1657
02:22:17.988 --> 02:22:20.698
Or cause rabbits to appear?

1658
02:22:28.666 --> 02:22:32.418
I will give your staff
a greater wonder to perform.

1659
02:22:34.046 --> 02:22:37.215
Bear it before your idle people

1660
02:22:37.383 --> 02:22:40.677
and bid them make bricks without straw.

1661
02:22:40.844 --> 02:22:42.804
How can people make bricks
without straw?

1662
02:22:42.972 --> 02:22:44.931
Let his staff provide them with it.

1663
02:22:47.142 --> 02:22:50.353
Or let them glean straw
in the fields for themselves.

1664
02:22:54.692 --> 02:22:58.361
But their tally of bricks
shall not diminish.

1665
02:22:58.529 --> 02:23:00.530
So let it be written.

1666
02:23:01.949 --> 02:23:03.283
So let it be done.

1667
02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:23.761
We are free!

1668
02:23:31.812 --> 02:23:36.107
Aaron! Aaron,
when do we leave Egypt?

1669
02:23:36.275 --> 02:23:39.027
We do not leave Egypt.

1670
02:23:39.194 --> 02:23:42.739
But Moses promised us.

1671
02:23:43.866 --> 02:23:46.117
But you said we'd be freed!

1672
02:23:47.328 --> 02:23:50.246
I have brought more evil upon you.

1673
02:23:51.332 --> 02:23:55.376
God forgive my weak use
of his strength.

1674
02:23:55.544 --> 02:23:58.713
- Weak use?
- Moses, what have you done to us?

1675
02:23:58.881 --> 02:24:03.384
It is Pharaoh's order
that you be given no straw

1676
02:24:03.552 --> 02:24:06.888
- to make your tally of bricks.
- No straw?

1677
02:24:09.266 --> 02:24:12.352
How can we make bricks without straw?

1678
02:24:12.519 --> 02:24:16.689
You will glean the stubble
of the fields by night.

1679
02:24:16.857 --> 02:24:18.733
And your women and children, too.

1680
02:24:19.485 --> 02:24:20.943
Is this the deliverer?

1681
02:24:21.111 --> 02:24:23.363
You've brought
the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!

1682
02:24:23.530 --> 02:24:26.032
You put a sword in their hands
to kill us!

1683
02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.119
Stone him! Stone him!

1684
02:24:37.503 --> 02:24:40.338
Stand aside! Come!

1685
02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:44.258
Follow!

1686
02:24:50.849 --> 02:24:55.728
There goes your deliverer.
Now, go find your straw.

1687
02:24:55.896 --> 02:25:00.149
Remember, the tally must be
the same. Not one brick less.

1688
02:25:28.679 --> 02:25:31.180
I cursed you.

1689
02:25:31.348 --> 02:25:36.310
Each time Rameses took me in
his arms, I cursed you, not him,

1690
02:25:36.478 --> 02:25:39.230
because I love you.

1691
02:25:39.398 --> 02:25:42.567
The Moses who loved you
was another man.

1692
02:25:42.734 --> 02:25:44.777
No, he was not.

1693
02:25:45.946 --> 02:25:49.365
You believe you've changed,
but you haven't.

1694
02:25:49.533 --> 02:25:53.286
You call yourself a prophet,
a man of God,

1695
02:25:53.454 --> 02:25:55.872
but I know better.

1696
02:25:56.039 --> 02:25:59.917
I don't believe that only the
thunder of a mountain stirs your heart,

1697
02:26:00.085 --> 02:26:02.295
as you stir mine.

1698
02:26:02.463 --> 02:26:07.633
Nefretiri, I have stood in the
burning light of God's own presence.

1699
02:26:09.887 --> 02:26:12.513
It was not he who saved you just now.

1700
02:26:12.681 --> 02:26:14.807
I did that.

1701
02:26:14.975 --> 02:26:18.394
Oh, Moses, Moses.

1702
02:26:18.562 --> 02:26:23.149
Why, of all men, did I fall in love
with the prince of fools?

1703
02:26:25.319 --> 02:26:29.572
But I believe anything you tell me
when I'm in your arms.

1704
02:26:30.824 --> 02:26:33.367
Why must you deny me and yourself?

1705
02:26:33.535 --> 02:26:36.537
Because I am bound to a God

1706
02:26:36.705 --> 02:26:39.707
and to a people
and to a shepherd girl.

1707
02:26:42.544 --> 02:26:47.340
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?

1708
02:26:47.508 --> 02:26:51.177
Unless the desert sun
has dulled your senses.

1709
02:26:52.262 --> 02:26:56.849
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?

1710
02:26:57.017 --> 02:27:01.020
Or is it soft as mine?

1711
02:27:01.188 --> 02:27:04.232
Are her lips chafed and dry
as the desert sand?

1712
02:27:04.399 --> 02:27:07.777
Or are they moist and red

1713
02:27:07.945 --> 02:27:10.029
like a pomegranate?

1714
02:27:12.282 --> 02:27:16.369
Is it the fragrance of myrrh
that scents her hair?

1715
02:27:17.871 --> 02:27:20.248
Or is it the odor of sheep?

1716
02:27:22.251 --> 02:27:26.254
There is a beauty
beyond the senses, Nefretiri.

1717
02:27:26.421 --> 02:27:31.634
Beauty like the quiet
of green valleys and still waters.

1718
02:27:32.970 --> 02:27:36.472
Beauty of the spirit
that you cannot understand.

1719
02:27:39.142 --> 02:27:40.685
Perhaps not.

1720
02:27:43.146 --> 02:27:47.733
But beauty of the spirit
will not free your people, Moses.

1721
02:27:47.901 --> 02:27:53.573
You will come to me
or they will never leave Egypt.

1722
02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:57.827
The fate of Israel
is not in your hands, Nefretiri.

1723
02:27:57.995 --> 02:28:00.496
Oh, isn't it?

1724
02:28:00.664 --> 02:28:03.457
Who else can soften Pharaoh's heart?

1725
02:28:05.294 --> 02:28:07.336
Or harden it?

1726
02:28:09.506 --> 02:28:10.840
Yes.

1727
02:28:11.717 --> 02:28:14.010
You may be the lovely dust

1728
02:28:14.177 --> 02:28:17.388
through which God
will work his purpose.

1729
02:28:24.938 --> 02:28:27.565
Fill everyjar in your house with water.

1730
02:28:27.733 --> 02:28:30.109
Tell the others that for seven days
there will be none to drink.

1731
02:28:30.277 --> 02:28:33.237
- But this well has never run dry.
- And the river is high.

1732
02:28:33.405 --> 02:28:34.780
What does it mean?

1733
02:28:34.948 --> 02:28:38.492
- Whose word is that?
- One who knows.

1734
02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:40.953
So fill your jars or go thirsty.

1735
02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:47.418
- Miriam is always right.
- Yes, I'm going back for more jars.

1736
02:28:47.586 --> 02:28:49.253
No water for seven days.

1737
02:28:50.213 --> 02:28:52.298
Yes, Joshua.

1738
02:28:52.466 --> 02:28:54.383
She comes to the well every day.

1739
02:28:55.344 --> 02:28:57.678
Wait, and you will see her.

1740
02:29:06.229 --> 02:29:09.732
It is wise of Dathan
to send you to the well, Lilia,

1741
02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:12.360
or he might find his water poisoned.

1742
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:17.073
They told me you were dead.

1743
02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:22.995
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.

1744
02:29:25.916 --> 02:29:31.253
- Dathan?
- Yes. Dathan.

1745
02:29:31.421 --> 02:29:34.298
Of your own free will?

1746
02:29:34.466 --> 02:29:36.717
Of my own free will.

1747
02:29:38.428 --> 02:29:42.264
You are no man's slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.

1748
02:29:42.432 --> 02:29:44.767
Not for me, Joshua.

1749
02:29:49.731 --> 02:29:52.358
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!

1750
02:29:52.526 --> 02:29:54.902
Thy life-giving waters
are the blood of Egypt.

1751
02:29:56.446 --> 02:29:59.281
Hail to thee, maker of barley,

1752
02:29:59.449 --> 02:30:03.285
feeder of cattle, carrier of ships,

1753
02:30:03.453 --> 02:30:06.080
greatest of all the gods.

1754
02:30:06.248 --> 02:30:10.960
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.

1755
02:30:11.128 --> 02:30:13.462
Let my people go!

1756
02:30:15.132 --> 02:30:17.007
- The point of the sword...
- Let him rave on,

1757
02:30:17.175 --> 02:30:19.593
that men shall know him mad.

1758
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:24.306
Obey the Lord,

1759
02:30:24.474 --> 02:30:27.977
or he will raise his hand
against the waters of the river.

1760
02:30:28.145 --> 02:30:32.356
I have come to bless the waters,
you have come to curse them.

1761
02:30:32.524 --> 02:30:36.861
We will learn if a god of shepherds
is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.

1762
02:30:37.988 --> 02:30:41.615
Water of life, give drink to the desert

1763
02:30:41.783 --> 02:30:45.161
- and make green the meadow.
- Aaron.

1764
02:30:46.997 --> 02:30:50.166
Stretch out my staff against the waters.

1765
02:31:00.093 --> 02:31:02.386
- Look!
- There!

1766
02:31:02.554 --> 02:31:04.722
Where he struck the river, it bleeds.

1767
02:31:04.890 --> 02:31:06.891
The water turns to blood!

1768
02:31:17.152 --> 02:31:19.195
Blood flows from the god!

1769
02:31:20.530 --> 02:31:22.948
See how it spreads.

1770
02:31:25.744 --> 02:31:27.703
It is blood!

1771
02:31:35.003 --> 02:31:38.380
That you may know
the power of the Lord,

1772
02:31:38.548 --> 02:31:42.051
for seven days, Egypt will thirst.

1773
02:31:42.219 --> 02:31:45.054
Seven days without water!
Fill everyjug and jar!

1774
02:31:45.222 --> 02:31:49.266
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
- Were it seven times seven days,

1775
02:31:49.434 --> 02:31:53.229
no magician's trick
will set your people free.

1776
02:31:57.651 --> 02:31:59.693
Sacred water,

1777
02:31:59.861 --> 02:32:04.281
make pure the flood
from which you came.

1778
02:32:13.625 --> 02:32:18.128
And God smote
the land with all manner of plagues,

1779
02:32:18.296 --> 02:32:21.257
but still Pharaoh's heart was hardened.

1780
02:32:30.517 --> 02:32:33.561
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.

1781
02:32:33.728 --> 02:32:36.689
They would cry louder
if they had to make the bricks.

1782
02:32:38.525 --> 02:32:40.109
- Send them away.
- The people have been plagued

1783
02:32:40.277 --> 02:32:44.446
by thirst, they've been plagued
by frogs, by lice, by flies,

1784
02:32:44.614 --> 02:32:46.824
by sickness, by boils.
They can endure no more.

1785
02:32:46.992 --> 02:32:48.325
Back to your homes!

1786
02:32:48.493 --> 02:32:50.578
Why do you bring
this worker of evil before me?

1787
02:32:50.745 --> 02:32:53.455
The people desert the temples.

1788
02:32:53.623 --> 02:32:56.166
- They turn from the gods.
- What gods?

1789
02:32:56.334 --> 02:32:58.127
You prophets and priests
made the gods,

1790
02:32:58.295 --> 02:33:01.714
that you may prey upon
the fears of men.

1791
02:33:01.882 --> 02:33:05.801
When the Nile ran red,
I too was afraid,

1792
02:33:05.969 --> 02:33:09.096
until word came of a mountain
beyond the cataracts

1793
02:33:09.264 --> 02:33:13.976
which spewed red mud
and poisoned the water.

1794
02:33:14.144 --> 02:33:17.021
Was it the staff I gave you
that caused all this?

1795
02:33:17.188 --> 02:33:19.315
Was it the wonder of your god
that fish should die

1796
02:33:19.482 --> 02:33:21.483
and frogs should leave the waters?

1797
02:33:21.651 --> 02:33:24.904
Was it a miracle that flies and lice
should bloat upon their carrion

1798
02:33:25.071 --> 02:33:28.365
and spread disease
in both man and beast?

1799
02:33:28.533 --> 02:33:31.994
These things were ordered
by themselves,

1800
02:33:32.162 --> 02:33:34.788
not by any god!

1801
02:33:34.956 --> 02:33:36.790
Now, go.

1802
02:33:41.922 --> 02:33:45.341
That you may know
these things are done of God...

1803
02:33:50.555 --> 02:33:54.183
...you shall see hail fall
from a clear sky

1804
02:33:54.351 --> 02:33:58.020
and burn as fire upon the ground.

1805
02:33:58.188 --> 02:34:00.522
You shall see darkness cover Egypt

1806
02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:03.943
when the sun climbs high to noon.

1807
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:07.863
And you shall know that God is God

1808
02:34:08.031 --> 02:34:11.158
and bow down to his will.

1809
02:34:11.326 --> 02:34:16.497
Nothing of this Earth
can make me bow to you, Moses.

1810
02:34:16.665 --> 02:34:20.709
Behold, the hail comes.

1811
02:34:20.877 --> 02:34:24.421
When darkness has covered Egypt
for three days,

1812
02:34:24.589 --> 02:34:27.383
your ministers will send for me.

1813
02:35:11.428 --> 02:35:12.761
In the three days of darkness,

1814
02:35:12.929 --> 02:35:16.807
you have whined like
frightened children in the night.

1815
02:35:16.975 --> 02:35:21.020
Moses said the sun would shine
in three days and it is true.

1816
02:35:21.187 --> 02:35:23.105
Oh, great one, let his people go,

1817
02:35:23.273 --> 02:35:27.317
or all of Egypt will be barren
from the cataracts to the sea.

1818
02:35:28.945 --> 02:35:31.405
Will my father free the slaves?

1819
02:35:31.573 --> 02:35:34.783
Can taxes be collected
from dead cattle and blighted harvests?

1820
02:35:34.951 --> 02:35:39.288
Does fear rule Egypt, or do I?

1821
02:35:39.456 --> 02:35:41.457
We fear no army of the Earth,

1822
02:35:41.624 --> 02:35:43.584
but can we fight plagues with swords?

1823
02:35:43.752 --> 02:35:45.002
There is no shame in this.

1824
02:35:45.170 --> 02:35:46.462
The strongest tree bends.

1825
02:35:46.629 --> 02:35:50.049
It is not Pharaoh
who yields to the slave,

1826
02:35:51.092 --> 02:35:52.885
but his counselors.

1827
02:35:53.053 --> 02:35:56.638
I have summoned Moses
at your request.

1828
02:35:58.641 --> 02:36:00.642
People will bless you, great one.

1829
02:36:00.810 --> 02:36:02.853
No other choice, Pharaoh.

1830
02:36:03.021 --> 02:36:06.982
Does the world bow to an empty throne?

1831
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:09.276
Empty?

1832
02:36:09.444 --> 02:36:13.322
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart
against his son?

1833
02:36:13.490 --> 02:36:17.117
If you let the Hebrews go,
who will build his cities?

1834
02:36:17.285 --> 02:36:20.329
You told Moses
to make bricks without straw.

1835
02:36:20.497 --> 02:36:23.874
Now, he tells you
to make cities without bricks!

1836
02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:29.880
Who is the slave,
and who is the Pharaoh?

1837
02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:34.009
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?

1838
02:36:34.177 --> 02:36:37.596
Yes, the laughter of kings

1839
02:36:38.098 --> 02:36:40.849
in Babylon, in Canaan,

1840
02:36:41.017 --> 02:36:42.434
in Troy,

1841
02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:49.149
as Egypt surrenders
to the god of slaves!

1842
02:36:55.115 --> 02:36:57.241
Bring the Hebrew in.

1843
02:37:01.037 --> 02:37:04.540
Go into the garden.
It's not good for a son of Pharaoh

1844
02:37:04.707 --> 02:37:08.210
to see his father humbled
by a son of slaves.

1845
02:37:08.378 --> 02:37:12.714
My son, stand beside me.

1846
02:37:20.056 --> 02:37:25.060
Have the days of darkness
made you see the light, Rameses?

1847
02:37:25.228 --> 02:37:27.396
Will you now free my people?

1848
02:37:27.564 --> 02:37:31.108
Great one,
bid the scribe read the order.

1849
02:37:31.276 --> 02:37:33.068
Give me the writing.

1850
02:37:39.534 --> 02:37:40.701
Sublime, ye Pharaoh.

1851
02:37:40.869 --> 02:37:43.036
You cannot resist the power
of his god!

1852
02:37:43.204 --> 02:37:45.706
I know not his god!

1853
02:37:45.874 --> 02:37:47.875
Neither will I let his people go.

1854
02:37:55.508 --> 02:37:59.720
How long will you refuse
to humble yourself before God?

1855
02:38:00.763 --> 02:38:03.932
If you bring another plague upon us,

1856
02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:08.604
it is not your god but I who
will turn the Nile red with blood.

1857
02:38:08.771 --> 02:38:12.232
As your father's father
turned the streets of Goshen red

1858
02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:14.860
with the blood of our male children!

1859
02:38:15.028 --> 02:38:18.363
If there is one more plague on Egypt,

1860
02:38:18.531 --> 02:38:22.284
it is by your word
that God will bring it.

1861
02:38:22.452 --> 02:38:26.622
And there shall be so great
a cry throughout the land

1862
02:38:26.789 --> 02:38:30.584
that you will surely let the people go.

1863
02:38:33.504 --> 02:38:36.089
Come to me no more, Moses,

1864
02:38:36.257 --> 02:38:40.219
for on the day you see my face again,

1865
02:38:40.386 --> 02:38:42.721
you will surely die.

1866
02:38:44.057 --> 02:38:45.974
So let it be written.

1867
02:38:52.607 --> 02:38:55.651
I will give this spawn of slaves
and his god

1868
02:38:55.818 --> 02:38:58.904
an answer the world will not forget!

1869
02:38:59.072 --> 02:39:04.076
Commander of the Host,
call on the chariots from Tanis.

1870
02:39:04.244 --> 02:39:07.663
There shall be one more plague,

1871
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:10.415
only it will come upon
the slaves of Goshen!

1872
02:39:11.751 --> 02:39:14.836
First-born of each house shall die,

1873
02:39:16.005 --> 02:39:18.340
beginning with the son of Moses.

1874
02:39:53.459 --> 02:39:56.503
You are the shepherd girl
that Moses married?

1875
02:39:56.671 --> 02:40:01.675
The queen of Egypt is beautiful,
as he told me.

1876
02:40:04.637 --> 02:40:06.596
My husband is not here.

1877
02:40:14.063 --> 02:40:16.732
Is this Moses' son?

1878
02:40:16.899 --> 02:40:18.984
Yes, this is our son.

1879
02:40:19.902 --> 02:40:22.404
What do you want of us?

1880
02:40:22.572 --> 02:40:24.781
You need have no fear of me.

1881
02:40:26.034 --> 02:40:28.660
I feared only his memory of you.

1882
02:40:30.413 --> 02:40:32.873
You have been able to erase it?

1883
02:40:34.751 --> 02:40:37.127
He has forgotten both of us.

1884
02:40:39.922 --> 02:40:43.008
You lost him
when he went to seek his God.

1885
02:40:44.427 --> 02:40:47.554
I lost him when he found his God.

1886
02:40:49.057 --> 02:40:51.975
At least he left you a son to cherish.

1887
02:40:53.436 --> 02:40:55.937
I am here to save his son.

1888
02:40:57.398 --> 02:40:59.608
- From what?
- From Pharaoh's decree

1889
02:40:59.776 --> 02:41:02.444
that the first-born of Israel must die.

1890
02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:06.031
Die?

1891
02:41:07.617 --> 02:41:09.785
God of Abraham!

1892
02:41:11.037 --> 02:41:16.124
Don't let him do this!
Not to the children!

1893
02:41:16.292 --> 02:41:19.169
A caravan for Midian
is waiting for you and your son.

1894
02:41:19.337 --> 02:41:21.296
My chariot will bring you to it.

1895
02:41:46.656 --> 02:41:48.698
I'm surprised you noticed me.

1896
02:41:50.159 --> 02:41:52.994
You didn't at the palace
this morning, you know?

1897
02:41:53.162 --> 02:41:56.957
Why? Were you afraid to look at me?

1898
02:41:58.167 --> 02:42:00.335
What do you want, Nefretiri?

1899
02:42:00.503 --> 02:42:03.004
You, Moses.

1900
02:42:03.172 --> 02:42:05.424
Everything about us
is coming to an end!

1901
02:42:06.426 --> 02:42:09.511
You will destroy Egypt
or Egypt will destroy you.

1902
02:42:10.346 --> 02:42:12.431
I belong to you, Moses.

1903
02:42:18.146 --> 02:42:21.189
She's gone with your son to Midian.

1904
02:42:21.357 --> 02:42:23.275
Why would she leave?

1905
02:42:23.443 --> 02:42:27.070
She knew you would try to save the
other children before your own son.

1906
02:42:27.238 --> 02:42:29.406
Save the other children? From what?

1907
02:42:29.574 --> 02:42:33.743
Rameses is massing the Libyan axmen,
the chariots, the Sardinian swordsmen.

1908
02:42:33.911 --> 02:42:35.787
Why? Tell me why!

1909
02:42:35.955 --> 02:42:40.041
- To destroy the first-born of Israel.
- Oh, God!

1910
02:42:40.877 --> 02:42:42.419
My God!

1911
02:42:42.587 --> 02:42:45.630
Out of his own mouth
comes thyjudgment!

1912
02:42:45.798 --> 02:42:48.967
- But I have saved your son, Moses.
- It is not my son who will die!

1913
02:42:49.135 --> 02:42:51.219
It is... It is the first-born of Egypt!

1914
02:42:51.387 --> 02:42:55.849
- It is your son, Nefretiri!
- No.

1915
02:42:56.017 --> 02:42:59.060
You would not dare
strike Pharaoh's son!

1916
02:42:59.228 --> 02:43:01.730
In the hardness of his heart,
Pharaoh has mocked God

1917
02:43:01.898 --> 02:43:04.316
and brings death to his own son!

1918
02:43:05.526 --> 02:43:07.569
But he's my son, Moses.

1919
02:43:07.737 --> 02:43:10.822
You would not harm my son?

1920
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:12.741
By myself, I am nothing.

1921
02:43:12.909 --> 02:43:16.703
It is the power of God
which uses me to work his will.

1922
02:43:16.871 --> 02:43:19.956
You would not let him do this to me.

1923
02:43:20.124 --> 02:43:22.375
I saved your son.

1924
02:43:22.543 --> 02:43:24.794
I cannot save yours.

1925
02:43:24.962 --> 02:43:27.464
Your god listens to you, Moses.

1926
02:43:28.883 --> 02:43:31.301
About midnight,

1927
02:43:31.469 --> 02:43:35.222
the destroyer will come
into the midst of Egypt

1928
02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:37.432
and all the first-born shall die,

1929
02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:41.728
from the first-born of Pharaoh
to the first-born of his servants.

1930
02:43:43.481 --> 02:43:46.066
When you were Prince of Egypt,

1931
02:43:46.234 --> 02:43:48.818
you held me in your arms.

1932
02:43:48.986 --> 02:43:50.695
When you were a condemned slave,

1933
02:43:50.863 --> 02:43:55.116
I threw myself at your feet
before the court of Pharaoh.

1934
02:43:55.284 --> 02:43:57.285
Because I loved you, Moses.

1935
02:43:57.453 --> 02:44:01.289
It is the Lord who
executes judgment, Nefretiri.

1936
02:44:03.626 --> 02:44:05.627
Go back to your son.

1937
02:44:10.883 --> 02:44:14.553
Your love for me is stronger
than the power of any god.

1938
02:44:17.014 --> 02:44:19.766
You will not kill my son.

1939
02:44:25.690 --> 02:44:28.984
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!

1940
02:44:43.666 --> 02:44:46.876
<i>Death cometh to me</i>

1941
02:44:47.878 --> 02:44:52.465
<i>To set me free</i>

1942
02:44:52.633 --> 02:44:57.345
<i>Death cometh to me...</i>

1943
02:44:57.513 --> 02:45:01.182
No, Lilia,
death will not come to you.

1944
02:45:04.437 --> 02:45:06.187
Joshua!

1945
02:45:08.024 --> 02:45:11.067
Joshua, you risk your life
in coming here.

1946
02:45:11.235 --> 02:45:14.362
- You are first-born.
- So are you.

1947
02:45:16.198 --> 02:45:21.036
I bring lamb's blood
to mark the doorposts and lintel,

1948
02:45:21.203 --> 02:45:23.622
that the Angel of Death may pass you by.

1949
02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:28.001
Joshua, it is enough
that you have come to me.

1950
02:45:29.086 --> 02:45:32.464
I am outcast among our people.

1951
02:45:32.632 --> 02:45:36.176
Don't save me from death,
Joshua, save me from life.

1952
02:45:36.344 --> 02:45:39.179
Tomorrow will bring
a new world for us, Lilia.

1953
02:45:39.347 --> 02:45:43.058
There will be no new world!
And no blood on this door!

1954
02:45:43.225 --> 02:45:46.770
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God's promise!

1955
02:45:46.937 --> 02:45:50.398
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.

1956
02:45:50.566 --> 02:45:55.111
Remember, Joshua,
of her own free will she's mine.

1957
02:46:48.582 --> 02:46:52.085
<i>Under his wing shalt thou trust</i>

1958
02:46:55.089 --> 02:46:57.674
"Though we stand
in the shadow of death,

1959
02:46:57.842 --> 02:47:00.760
the Lord is our God. The Lord is one."

1960
02:47:00.928 --> 02:47:03.722
"The Lord is our God. The Lord is one."

1961
02:47:05.141 --> 02:47:09.352
<i>His truth shall be thy shield</i>

1962
02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:12.981
"Shield us through this night of terror,
O King of the Universe."

1963
02:47:18.154 --> 02:47:19.904
Why is everyone afraid?

1964
02:47:20.072 --> 02:47:23.533
Why is this night different
from all others?

1965
02:47:23.701 --> 02:47:26.828
Because this night the Lord our God

1966
02:47:26.996 --> 02:47:29.581
will deliver us
from the bondage of Egypt.

1967
02:47:29.749 --> 02:47:33.710
<i>Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night</i>

1968
02:47:33.878 --> 02:47:36.296
Stand all!

1969
02:47:37.923 --> 02:47:41.509
- Pharaoh's soldiers!
- Or worse!

1970
02:47:46.515 --> 02:47:50.268
<i>Or from the arrow
that flyeth by day</i>

1971
02:47:54.064 --> 02:47:55.982
Bithiah!

1972
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:59.819
In fear of your god,
they have set me free.

1973
02:47:59.987 --> 02:48:02.030
May a stranger enter?

1974
02:48:04.450 --> 02:48:08.578
There are no strangers among
those who seek God's mercy.

1975
02:48:09.747 --> 02:48:11.664
My bearers?

1976
02:48:11.832 --> 02:48:14.209
All who thirst for freedom
may come with us.

1977
02:48:18.255 --> 02:48:21.341
The darkness of death
will pass over us tonight.

1978
02:48:21.509 --> 02:48:24.260
Tomorrow the light of freedom
will shine upon us

1979
02:48:24.428 --> 02:48:28.348
- as we go forth from Egypt.
- I shall go with you, Moses.

1980
02:48:28.516 --> 02:48:31.768
- A princess of Egypt!
- From the house of Pharaoh!

1981
02:48:31.936 --> 02:48:35.688
- She follows the gods of Egypt.
- An idol-worshipper!

1982
02:48:35.856 --> 02:48:38.316
This woman drew me from the Nile

1983
02:48:38.484 --> 02:48:42.529
and set my feet
upon the path of knowledge.

1984
02:48:42.696 --> 02:48:47.408
Mered, bring a chair to our table
for the daughter of Pharaoh.

1985
02:48:47.576 --> 02:48:51.371
There is a great light that
shines from your face, Moses.

1986
02:48:51.539 --> 02:48:53.915
Perhaps some day
I shall come to understand it.

1987
02:48:54.083 --> 02:48:56.584
He is God's messenger, Princess.

1988
02:50:04.028 --> 02:50:07.488
If it is not forbidden to look
upon the breath of pestilence,

1989
02:50:07.656 --> 02:50:10.909
then see, for it is here.

1990
02:50:12.119 --> 02:50:14.621
Do not look, Eleazar.

1991
02:50:14.788 --> 02:50:18.917
Close the door, Joshua,
and let death pass.

1992
02:50:27.009 --> 02:50:30.428
Will it pass, Moses? Will it pass?

1993
02:50:30.596 --> 02:50:33.306
That is God's promise, Elisheba.

1994
02:50:40.147 --> 02:50:43.107
"Blessed art thou, O Lord our God,

1995
02:50:43.275 --> 02:50:45.777
who bringeth forth bread
from the Earth."

1996
02:50:52.993 --> 02:50:55.411
Run! Run!

1997
02:50:55.579 --> 02:50:59.040
There shall no evil befall you,

1998
02:50:59.208 --> 02:51:01.417
or any plagues come near you.

1999
02:51:01.585 --> 02:51:04.420
<i>A thousand shall fall at thy sight</i>

2000
02:51:04.588 --> 02:51:07.882
Why do we eat unleavened bread
and bitter herbs, my uncle?

2001
02:51:08.050 --> 02:51:10.760
- The herbs...
- Faster!

2002
02:51:10.928 --> 02:51:13.513
Take the other road!

2003
02:51:16.350 --> 02:51:20.937
The herbs remind us of the
bitterness of our captivity, Eleazar.

2004
02:51:21.105 --> 02:51:24.983
<i>But it shall not come nigh thee</i>

2005
02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:27.318
This is the bread of haste,

2006
02:51:27.486 --> 02:51:29.445
that you will remember this night

2007
02:51:29.613 --> 02:51:33.032
from generation to generation forever.

2008
02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:36.577
Oh, my baby!
Give me back my baby!

2009
02:51:36.745 --> 02:51:41.749
- They are my people.
- All are God's people.

2010
02:51:45.504 --> 02:51:48.089
Death is all around us!

2011
02:51:48.257 --> 02:51:51.676
But it passes those
who have believed the Lord.

2012
02:51:53.012 --> 02:51:56.014
Always remember, Eleazar,

2013
02:51:56.181 --> 02:51:58.808
he passed over your house.

2014
02:52:06.608 --> 02:52:09.944
Are the captains of Egypt
afraid of a night mist?

2015
02:52:10.112 --> 02:52:14.949
- The death cry is everywhere.
- Some devil's curse! Look!

2016
02:52:33.385 --> 02:52:36.179
I've known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh,

2017
02:52:36.346 --> 02:52:38.639
but I've not known fear till tonight.

2018
02:52:38.807 --> 02:52:40.725
Aide.

2019
02:52:43.062 --> 02:52:46.147
Have the captains join their men.

2020
02:52:46.315 --> 02:52:49.817
At the coming of dawn, we will strike.

2021
02:52:49.985 --> 02:52:52.904
No first-born Hebrew shall live.

2022
02:53:06.376 --> 02:53:09.003
Let the Hebrews go, great one,

2023
02:53:09.171 --> 02:53:11.589
or we are all dead men.

2024
02:53:24.561 --> 02:53:26.270
He was your son?

2025
02:53:27.231 --> 02:53:29.357
My first-born.

2026
02:53:51.964 --> 02:53:56.676
There is no magic cure,
no spell to use.

2027
02:53:56.844 --> 02:53:59.345
He is the first-born of Pharaoh.

2028
02:53:59.513 --> 02:54:04.058
We have no skill
before this... pestilence.

2029
02:54:08.647 --> 02:54:12.692
- My father.
- My son.

2030
02:54:13.902 --> 02:54:16.696
Your own curse is on him.

2031
02:54:16.864 --> 02:54:20.408
- Where did you hear this?
- From Moses.

2032
02:54:21.660 --> 02:54:23.077
I would not let his people go

2033
02:54:23.245 --> 02:54:26.747
because your serpent's tongue
hardened my heart.

2034
02:54:27.916 --> 02:54:31.419
You only thought to keep Moses here.

2035
02:54:31.587 --> 02:54:35.256
You cared nothing for my throne,

2036
02:54:35.424 --> 02:54:37.508
or my son.

2037
02:54:38.594 --> 02:54:41.179
I asked Moses for his life.

2038
02:54:42.973 --> 02:54:45.850
The shadow of death is on his face.

2039
02:54:46.018 --> 02:54:51.355
No... he will not die.

2040
02:54:52.316 --> 02:54:54.567
Captain.

2041
02:54:54.735 --> 02:54:58.738
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.

2042
02:54:58.906 --> 02:55:01.032
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.

2043
02:55:02.451 --> 02:55:04.410
He's my only son.

2044
02:55:41.323 --> 02:55:43.616
You have conquered, Moses.

2045
02:55:45.202 --> 02:55:48.829
The foot of a slave
is on the neck of Egypt.

2046
02:55:50.832 --> 02:55:53.793
You were saved from the Nile
to be a curse upon me.

2047
02:55:53.961 --> 02:55:56.921
Your shadow fell
between me and my father,

2048
02:55:57.089 --> 02:56:00.466
between me and my fame,

2049
02:56:01.843 --> 02:56:04.095
between me and my queen.

2050
02:56:04.263 --> 02:56:09.392
Your shadow now fills
all things with death.

2051
02:56:09.559 --> 02:56:12.645
Go out from among us,
you and your people.

2052
02:56:12.813 --> 02:56:14.438
I set you free.

2053
02:56:14.606 --> 02:56:17.024
It is not by your word,

2054
02:56:17.192 --> 02:56:21.070
nor by my hand
that we are free, Pharaoh.

2055
02:56:21.238 --> 02:56:25.700
- The power of God has freed us.
- Enough of your words!

2056
02:56:25.867 --> 02:56:29.537
Take your people, your cattle,
your god and your pestilence.

2057
02:56:29.705 --> 02:56:33.124
Take what spoils
from Egypt you will, but go!

2058
02:56:35.544 --> 02:56:38.796
O Lord God,

2059
02:56:38.964 --> 02:56:41.841
with a strong hand thou dost

2060
02:56:42.009 --> 02:56:44.719
bring us out of bitter bondage.

2061
02:56:47.055 --> 02:56:50.433
Tomorrow we go forth a free nation,

2062
02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:54.854
where every man shall reap
what he has sown

2063
02:56:55.022 --> 02:56:59.191
and bow no knee except in prayer.

2064
02:56:59.359 --> 02:57:03.237
We will go with our young
and with our old,

2065
02:57:03.405 --> 02:57:07.199
with our sons and with our daughters,

2066
02:57:07.367 --> 02:57:11.746
with our flocks
and with our herds will we go,

2067
02:57:11.913 --> 02:57:15.583
for I know that the Lord is great...

2068
02:57:15.751 --> 02:57:19.253
...and that
our Lord is above all gods.

2069
02:57:33.310 --> 02:57:35.227
He's dead.

2070
02:58:14.393 --> 02:58:17.144
Sokar,

2071
02:58:17.312 --> 02:58:21.107
great lord of the lower world,

2072
02:58:21.274 --> 02:58:26.195
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt,

2073
02:58:26.363 --> 02:58:28.072
bow before you now.

2074
02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:32.576
Show that you have power
above the god of Moses,

2075
02:58:32.744 --> 02:58:36.622
and restore the life
he has taken from my son.

2076
02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:42.002
Guide back his soul
across the lake of death

2077
02:58:42.170 --> 02:58:45.172
to the place of living men,

2078
02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:49.176
and I will raise a temple to you
mightier than the pyramids.

2079
02:58:49.344 --> 02:58:52.763
Hear me, Dread Lord of Darkness...

2080
02:59:14.828 --> 02:59:17.872
Arise, O Israel!

2081
02:59:18.039 --> 02:59:21.041
Behold the dawn of freedom!

2082
02:59:39.186 --> 02:59:44.064
And it came to pass,
after the stifling night of terror,

2083
02:59:44.232 --> 02:59:48.235
came a day such
as the world had never seen.

2084
02:59:48.403 --> 02:59:51.405
From east and west,
from north and south,

2085
02:59:51.573 --> 02:59:55.159
they came with all they had,
driving their flocks

2086
02:59:55.327 --> 02:59:57.703
and their herds
and their camels before them.

2087
02:59:57.871 --> 03:00:00.915
By tens, by hundreds, by thousands,

2088
03:00:01.082 --> 03:00:05.044
unending streams
of man and beast and burden,

2089
03:00:05.212 --> 03:00:07.755
and even very much cattle,

2090
03:00:07.923 --> 03:00:10.174
poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes.

2091
03:00:10.342 --> 03:00:15.262
Beneath the stone feet of the
four colossal images of Rameses,

2092
03:00:15.430 --> 03:00:18.140
which their own sweat
and blood and sinew

2093
03:00:18.308 --> 03:00:20.684
had hewn from solid rock,

2094
03:00:20.852 --> 03:00:25.439
a nation arose and freedom
was born into the world.

2095
03:00:27.108 --> 03:00:29.777
Grandfather, have you got Rebecca?

2096
03:00:29.945 --> 03:00:31.612
No, I haven't got Rebecca.

2097
03:00:31.780 --> 03:00:34.657
Here's the kneading trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.

2098
03:00:34.824 --> 03:00:36.450
This is a blessed day!

2099
03:00:36.618 --> 03:00:39.203
- Where's Rebecca?
- Here's Rebecca!

2100
03:00:39.371 --> 03:00:41.288
- Ben Caleb!
- Thank you!

2101
03:00:41.456 --> 03:00:43.832
- Can we take the cattle?
- We're moving to the gates.

2102
03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:45.334
Horn and hoof.

2103
03:00:45.502 --> 03:00:47.336
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.

2104
03:00:47.504 --> 03:00:50.839
Benjamin, don't forget
the oil for the lamps.

2105
03:00:51.007 --> 03:00:52.550
Where are we going, Naomi?

2106
03:00:52.717 --> 03:00:55.511
To some land flowing
with milk and honey!

2107
03:00:55.679 --> 03:00:58.097
I've never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?

2108
03:00:58.265 --> 03:01:01.642
It's away from the whip! Freedom
will wet your throats in the desert.

2109
03:01:01.810 --> 03:01:03.602
Fill your water skins.

2110
03:01:05.272 --> 03:01:08.440
This is the governor's house!
You cannot enter.

2111
03:01:08.608 --> 03:01:11.610
Out! Out, all of you!

2112
03:01:11.778 --> 03:01:14.822
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.

2113
03:01:14.990 --> 03:01:16.865
Then stone bleeds!

2114
03:01:22.664 --> 03:01:26.166
- Harness the mules!
- Your stonecutter did this to me!

2115
03:01:26.334 --> 03:01:30.087
All your gold cannot wipe
that mark from your door, Dathan,

2116
03:01:30.255 --> 03:01:32.047
or from my heart.

2117
03:01:32.215 --> 03:01:34.758
Just for that,
you'll walk all the way to...

2118
03:01:36.011 --> 03:01:38.679
Where are we going?

2119
03:01:38.847 --> 03:01:41.557
- Do you know where we're going?
- To hell, I hope!

2120
03:01:44.686 --> 03:01:48.689
Like Dathan, they did
not know where they were going,

2121
03:01:48.857 --> 03:01:53.485
and they cared no more than
the flocks and herds they drove.

2122
03:01:53.653 --> 03:01:58.073
Now they used the brick yokes
to carry a very different burden.

2123
03:01:59.034 --> 03:02:00.868
And there went forth among them

2124
03:02:01.036 --> 03:02:03.954
planters of vineyards
and sowers of seeds,

2125
03:02:04.122 --> 03:02:07.833
each hoping to sit under
his own vine and fig tree.

2126
03:02:08.877 --> 03:02:11.211
Out of this glorious chaos,

2127
03:02:11.379 --> 03:02:15.341
it is Joshua
who brings order and purpose.

2128
03:02:16.051 --> 03:02:18.677
Set the standard of each tribe
before all the people!

2129
03:02:18.845 --> 03:02:22.681
Levites in the center, Judah to
the right, Hephron to the left. Go!

2130
03:02:22.849 --> 03:02:24.016
Hallelujah!

2131
03:02:24.184 --> 03:02:27.019
Watch where you're going!
Watch out, you ribbon-carrier!

2132
03:02:27.187 --> 03:02:29.146
Keep your big feet out of my geese!

2133
03:03:03.765 --> 03:03:08.477
<i>His son Joseph</i>

2134
03:03:08.645 --> 03:03:14.358
<i>Many colors was his coat</i>

2135
03:03:17.654 --> 03:03:21.448
Aaron and the elders carry
a shrouded body, Grandfather!

2136
03:03:21.616 --> 03:03:25.119
They bear the bones of Joseph,
to rest in his own land.

2137
03:03:30.166 --> 03:03:32.418
Nubians, Grandfather!

2138
03:03:40.802 --> 03:03:44.888
- Here come treasure wagons!
- Spoils of Egypt.

2139
03:03:45.056 --> 03:03:50.519
All who shared the toil
will share this gold! Here, boy!

2140
03:03:50.687 --> 03:03:52.646
For the blind one!

2141
03:03:52.814 --> 03:03:56.900
It's a little golden calf,
Grandfather, with horns!

2142
03:03:57.068 --> 03:04:00.487
An idol. For idol-worshippers!

2143
03:04:01.781 --> 03:04:03.532
Grandpa, fire-bearers!

2144
03:04:06.828 --> 03:04:09.747
Plant your fires at night
beside the tribal standards,

2145
03:04:09.914 --> 03:04:11.832
where all may come
to light their torches!

2146
03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:16.086
- They'll be burning, Joshua!
- Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.

2147
03:04:16.254 --> 03:04:18.005
Now, the cradle.

2148
03:04:19.466 --> 03:04:20.507
Here, Miriam.

2149
03:04:20.675 --> 03:04:25.012
Joshua!

2150
03:04:27.265 --> 03:04:29.683
I have wagons
for the midwives and physicians.

2151
03:04:29.851 --> 03:04:32.519
- Where shall they be placed?
- Five thousand cubits, one...

2152
03:04:32.687 --> 03:04:33.937
Where's your whip, Dathan?

2153
03:04:34.105 --> 03:04:37.399
I'll pay you back every lash
you gave me, Dathan!

2154
03:04:43.615 --> 03:04:46.200
Now, is this a day for us
to have hard feelings?

2155
03:04:46.367 --> 03:04:47.618
I've felt your whip!

2156
03:04:47.786 --> 03:04:50.913
- Yes, every day.
- Lilia is no slave, Dathan!

2157
03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:53.749
You can carry your own carton.

2158
03:04:53.917 --> 03:04:55.709
Let her ride!

2159
03:04:57.003 --> 03:05:00.214
So, now, my brother,
we have new taskmasters.

2160
03:05:00.381 --> 03:05:03.884
- We serve no masters now!
- Yes, but not for long.

2161
03:05:04.844 --> 03:05:06.887
Here. Old woman.

2162
03:05:08.223 --> 03:05:09.973
- That's it.
- Joshua!

2163
03:05:10.141 --> 03:05:12.810
Make way for the governor!

2164
03:05:19.526 --> 03:05:23.195
- You know who I am.
- I know who you were, Lord Governor.

2165
03:05:23.363 --> 03:05:25.072
I go to serve the Pharaoh.

2166
03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:28.408
Tell Rameses
I'm coming back to my house.

2167
03:05:28.576 --> 03:05:33.038
That rabble may follow Moses
into the desert today,

2168
03:05:33.206 --> 03:05:35.833
but when their eyes
are seared red by the sun,

2169
03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.752
when their cracked lips
bleed with thirst,

2170
03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:41.213
when their stomachs
cramp with hunger,

2171
03:05:41.381 --> 03:05:44.299
they will curse
the name of Moses and his god.

2172
03:05:44.467 --> 03:05:49.137
Then I, Dathan, will lead them
back to Pharaoh and the brick pits.

2173
03:05:56.312 --> 03:05:58.272
There are so many.

2174
03:06:00.567 --> 03:06:02.234
So many.

2175
03:06:04.737 --> 03:06:08.699
How shall I find thy road
through the wilderness, Lord?

2176
03:06:10.243 --> 03:06:15.873
How shall I find water
in the desert for this multitude?

2177
03:06:21.546 --> 03:06:25.632
Moses, the people are assembled.

2178
03:06:27.886 --> 03:06:31.013
Then let us go forth
to the mountain of God,

2179
03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:34.349
that he may write his
commandments in our minds

2180
03:06:34.517 --> 03:06:36.935
and upon our hearts forever.

2181
03:06:37.103 --> 03:06:40.063
We march, praising his mighty name!

2182
03:06:41.649 --> 03:06:44.234
- What is the word, Joshua?
- The word is given!

2183
03:06:44.402 --> 03:06:46.820
Let the trumpets sound!

2184
03:06:53.828 --> 03:06:57.039
Hear, O Israel!

2185
03:06:57.206 --> 03:06:59.166
Remember this day,

2186
03:06:59.334 --> 03:07:04.630
when the strong hand of the Lord
leads you out of bondage!

2187
03:07:04.797 --> 03:07:09.509
The Lord is our God! The Lord is one!

2188
03:07:09.677 --> 03:07:14.264
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!

2189
03:07:56.849 --> 03:07:59.893
- Come on! Come on!
- Yes! Come on!

2190
03:08:00.061 --> 03:08:01.353
Joshua!

2191
03:08:01.521 --> 03:08:04.815
Four hundred years in bondage,
and today he won't move!

2192
03:08:40.351 --> 03:08:43.437
<i>The Lord is one</i>

2193
03:08:43.604 --> 03:08:46.440
<i>Praise to God</i>

2194
03:08:46.607 --> 03:08:48.900
<i>Thank thee, O Lord</i>

2195
03:09:01.122 --> 03:09:03.123
My litter can carry him.

2196
03:09:04.625 --> 03:09:07.753
I am poured out like water,

2197
03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:09.713
my strength dried up

2198
03:09:09.881 --> 03:09:13.300
into the dust... of death.

2199
03:09:13.468 --> 03:09:16.428
We shall plant your fig tree
in the new land.

2200
03:09:16.596 --> 03:09:18.305
Children shall eat of its fruit.

2201
03:09:21.726 --> 03:09:24.144
Do you hear that? Do you hear that?!

2202
03:09:24.312 --> 03:09:26.646
You have a strong new son!

2203
03:09:49.921 --> 03:09:54.341
And he brought
forth the people with joy and gladness.

2204
03:09:54.509 --> 03:09:56.510
He bore them out of Egypt

2205
03:09:56.677 --> 03:10:00.430
as an eagle bears its young
upon its wings.

2206
03:10:01.265 --> 03:10:05.435
But again,
Pharaoh's heart was hardened.

2207
03:10:12.068 --> 03:10:15.195
How many more days and nights
will you pray?

2208
03:10:16.364 --> 03:10:18.365
Does he hear you?

2209
03:10:21.285 --> 03:10:23.787
Dread Lord of Darkness,

2210
03:10:23.955 --> 03:10:27.165
are you not greater
than the god of Moses?

2211
03:10:28.376 --> 03:10:32.045
I have raised my voice to you,
yet life

2212
03:10:32.213 --> 03:10:34.840
has not come to the body of my son.

2213
03:10:36.551 --> 03:10:40.637
- Hear me!
- He cannot hear you.

2214
03:10:40.805 --> 03:10:44.099
He's nothing but a piece of stone
with the head of a bird.

2215
03:10:44.267 --> 03:10:46.434
He will hear me.

2216
03:10:49.021 --> 03:10:50.564
I am Egypt.

2217
03:10:50.731 --> 03:10:53.066
Egypt?

2218
03:10:53.234 --> 03:10:55.068
You are nothing.

2219
03:10:56.279 --> 03:10:59.322
You let Moses kill my son.

2220
03:10:59.490 --> 03:11:02.242
No god can bring him back.

2221
03:11:04.078 --> 03:11:06.413
What have you done to Moses?

2222
03:11:06.581 --> 03:11:09.541
How did he die?

2223
03:11:09.709 --> 03:11:12.669
Did he cry for mercy
when you tortured him?

2224
03:11:14.088 --> 03:11:15.547
Bring me to his body!

2225
03:11:15.715 --> 03:11:18.758
I want to see it, Rameses!
I want to see it!

2226
03:11:18.926 --> 03:11:20.927
This is my son.

2227
03:11:23.097 --> 03:11:25.182
He would have been Pharaoh.

2228
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:28.602
He would have ruled the world.

2229
03:11:29.604 --> 03:11:31.897
Who mourns him now?

2230
03:11:32.648 --> 03:11:37.402
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.

2231
03:11:38.821 --> 03:11:41.907
You will not see his body.

2232
03:11:42.074 --> 03:11:44.492
I drove him out of Egypt.

2233
03:11:46.621 --> 03:11:49.414
I cannot fight the power of his god.

2234
03:11:50.875 --> 03:11:53.126
His god?

2235
03:11:53.294 --> 03:11:56.796
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god,

2236
03:11:56.964 --> 03:12:01.259
but you are not a god,
you are even less than a man.

2237
03:12:02.929 --> 03:12:04.888
Listen to me, Rameses,

2238
03:12:05.056 --> 03:12:10.435
you thought I was evil when
I went to Moses, and you were right.

2239
03:12:10.603 --> 03:12:13.104
Shall I tell you what happened,
Rameses?

2240
03:12:14.273 --> 03:12:18.443
He spurned me,
like a strumpet in the street.

2241
03:12:18.611 --> 03:12:23.740
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!

2242
03:12:23.908 --> 03:12:27.953
All that you wanted from me
he would not even take.

2243
03:12:31.499 --> 03:12:34.000
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?

2244
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:37.754
Not the laughter of kings,

2245
03:12:37.922 --> 03:12:40.674
but the laughter of slaves
on the desert!

2246
03:12:44.053 --> 03:12:49.683
Laughter?

2247
03:12:53.980 --> 03:12:58.191
My son, I shall build your tomb
upon their crushed bodies!

2248
03:12:58.359 --> 03:13:02.696
If any escape me, their seed shall
be scattered and accursed forever!

2249
03:13:02.863 --> 03:13:05.699
My armor. War crown.

2250
03:13:05.866 --> 03:13:07.701
Laughter?

2251
03:13:07.868 --> 03:13:12.580
I will turn the laughter
of these slaves into wails of torment!

2252
03:13:12.748 --> 03:13:15.834
They shall remember the name of Moses,

2253
03:13:16.002 --> 03:13:19.212
only that he died
under my chariot wheels!

2254
03:13:21.215 --> 03:13:23.883
Kill him with your own hands.

2255
03:13:24.051 --> 03:13:27.762
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.

2256
03:13:27.930 --> 03:13:29.597
Assemble all the chariots
at the city gate.

2257
03:13:29.765 --> 03:13:32.976
- I obey!
- Nura and Thebes will draw my chariot.

2258
03:13:33.144 --> 03:13:36.062
I will bring you back
your temple treasure!

2259
03:14:08.304 --> 03:14:12.974
Bring it back to me
stained with his blood.

2260
03:14:13.142 --> 03:14:14.726
I will.

2261
03:14:17.188 --> 03:14:19.606
To mingle with your own!

2262
03:14:58.229 --> 03:14:59.354
Whoa!

2263
03:15:09.990 --> 03:15:11.658
Nura, Thebes!

2264
03:15:15.579 --> 03:15:17.747
Guards salute!

2265
03:15:18.624 --> 03:15:27.882
Hail!

2266
03:15:29.051 --> 03:15:31.010
Remember your first-born!

2267
03:15:32.721 --> 03:15:36.349
- Death to the slaves!
- Death to the slaves!

2268
03:15:36.517 --> 03:15:40.270
- Death to their god!
- Death to their god!

2269
03:15:40.438 --> 03:15:42.188
Hail!

2270
03:15:42.356 --> 03:15:44.065
Forward!

2271
03:16:40.831 --> 03:16:43.917
Do you hear thunder? Over the sea?

2272
03:16:45.294 --> 03:16:47.086
No, it comes from the desert.

2273
03:16:47.254 --> 03:16:49.631
That's the thunder of horses!

2274
03:16:49.798 --> 03:16:52.967
Look! Pharaoh's chariot!

2275
03:16:57.181 --> 03:17:01.100
We're trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!

2276
03:17:07.441 --> 03:17:08.942
Joshua?

2277
03:17:14.198 --> 03:17:15.865
That's Joshua's horn!

2278
03:17:16.033 --> 03:17:20.495
All men to the pass!
Get carts, wagons! Form a barrier!

2279
03:17:22.164 --> 03:17:24.123
- What's the alarm, Joshua?
- Pharaoh's chariot!

2280
03:17:24.291 --> 03:17:28.461
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!

2281
03:17:28.629 --> 03:17:32.882
- Bring shovels, pounders, mattocks!
- Hear me! Hear me!

2282
03:17:33.050 --> 03:17:35.218
Can mattocks stop arrows?

2283
03:17:35.386 --> 03:17:38.054
Will your little carts
stop Pharaoh's chariots?

2284
03:17:38.222 --> 03:17:40.223
You women, do you want
to see your men killed?

2285
03:17:40.391 --> 03:17:42.475
- Moses!
- Joshua, what is it?

2286
03:17:42.643 --> 03:17:45.645
Pharaoh's chariots!
I've ordered men to block the pass!

2287
03:17:45.813 --> 03:17:48.356
- How can we fight chariots?
- Nothing can stop them!

2288
03:17:48.524 --> 03:17:50.858
Order the men to move back, Joshua.

2289
03:17:51.026 --> 03:17:53.695
Move back? Where? Into the sea?

2290
03:17:53.862 --> 03:17:55.572
Into the hand of God.

2291
03:17:55.739 --> 03:17:59.200
Deliverer? Yes, he has
delivered you to death!

2292
03:18:00.828 --> 03:18:02.745
Run! Run!

2293
03:18:02.913 --> 03:18:05.373
Look! Look!

2294
03:18:07.501 --> 03:18:11.337
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!

2295
03:18:11.505 --> 03:18:13.673
Stone him! Stone him!

2296
03:18:24.768 --> 03:18:28.021
The god of Moses is a poor general,

2297
03:18:28.188 --> 03:18:29.647
to leave him no retreat.

2298
03:18:36.155 --> 03:18:40.491
Ten times you have seen
the miracles of the Lord!

2299
03:18:40.659 --> 03:18:43.202
And still you have no faith!

2300
03:18:43.370 --> 03:18:46.205
He's a false prophet
who delivers you to death!

2301
03:18:46.373 --> 03:18:48.958
Stone him! Stone him!

2302
03:18:50.961 --> 03:18:54.547
Listen to Moses! He speaks God's will!

2303
03:18:54.715 --> 03:18:56.215
Forward!

2304
03:19:02.514 --> 03:19:06.476
- They will stop for me!
- A charging chariot knows no rank.

2305
03:19:11.523 --> 03:19:13.566
Was it because
there were no graves in Egypt

2306
03:19:13.734 --> 03:19:15.902
that you took us away
to die in the wilderness?

2307
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:17.528
Why must we die?

2308
03:19:18.906 --> 03:19:20.865
Fear not!

2309
03:19:21.033 --> 03:19:26.162
Stand still, and see
the salvation of the Lord!

2310
03:19:36.048 --> 03:19:39.592
- A pillar of fire!
- It is the work of God!

2311
03:19:51.689 --> 03:19:53.314
Through it!

2312
03:19:55.275 --> 03:19:58.903
No, great one!
You cannot breach the fire of God!

2313
03:20:08.831 --> 03:20:12.291
Gather your families and your flocks.
We must go with all speed.

2314
03:20:12.459 --> 03:20:15.628
Go where? To drown in the sea?

2315
03:20:15.796 --> 03:20:17.839
How long will the fire
hold Pharaoh back?

2316
03:20:18.006 --> 03:20:20.133
- Will it hold?
- After this day,

2317
03:20:20.300 --> 03:20:22.510
you shall see his chariots no more!

2318
03:20:22.678 --> 03:20:25.805
No! You'll be dead under them!

2319
03:20:27.141 --> 03:20:30.977
The Lord of Hosts will do battle for us!

2320
03:20:34.606 --> 03:20:37.817
Behold his mighty hand!

2321
03:21:09.141 --> 03:21:11.309
The wind opens the sea!

2322
03:21:11.477 --> 03:21:15.188
God opens the sea
with the blast of his nostrils.

2323
03:21:19.985 --> 03:21:22.737
Lead them through
the midst of the waters.

2324
03:21:22.905 --> 03:21:24.697
His will be done!

2325
03:21:27.493 --> 03:21:32.246
He opens the waters before them,
and he bars our way with fire.

2326
03:21:32.414 --> 03:21:35.583
Let us go from this place.
Men cannot fight against a god!

2327
03:21:35.751 --> 03:21:38.544
Better to die in battle with a god,
than live in shame.

2328
03:21:38.712 --> 03:21:41.172
Praise God and down into it!

2329
03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:26.217
God has delivered us
from the son of Pharaoh.

2330
03:22:26.385 --> 03:22:28.970
<i>Jacob cherished</i>

2331
03:22:29.137 --> 03:22:32.598
<i>His son Joseph</i>

2332
03:22:32.766 --> 03:22:37.103
<i>Many colors was his coat</i>

2333
03:22:38.146 --> 03:22:40.690
- Help us!
- Never mind the wheel!

2334
03:22:47.823 --> 03:22:50.449
Pull! Pull for your lives!

2335
03:22:50.617 --> 03:22:52.869
Is your life worth so much?

2336
03:22:58.125 --> 03:23:00.668
<i>Jacob cherished</i>

2337
03:23:00.836 --> 03:23:04.213
<i>His son Joseph</i>

2338
03:23:04.381 --> 03:23:09.635
<i>Many colors was his coat</i>

2339
03:23:11.513 --> 03:23:15.099
<i>God of Abram</i>

2340
03:23:15.267 --> 03:23:18.644
<i>Isaac, Jacob</i>

2341
03:23:18.812 --> 03:23:24.442
<i>Ever bless us with Thy hand♪</i>

2342
03:23:41.084 --> 03:23:43.836
Get tow-lines on the midwife's cart!

2343
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:50.760
Save the bread if you can!

2344
03:23:50.928 --> 03:23:55.473
Ben Caleb!
Order all wagons to turn clear!

2345
03:24:00.896 --> 03:24:05.274
Moses! Stand on the rock where the
people can see you and have hope!

2346
03:24:05.442 --> 03:24:07.234
Above us!

2347
03:24:07.402 --> 03:24:09.028
Help that wagon!

2348
03:24:30.300 --> 03:24:32.009
The fire dies!

2349
03:24:34.721 --> 03:24:36.305
Sound the pursuit!

2350
03:24:50.362 --> 03:24:52.488
Chariots, halt!

2351
03:24:56.410 --> 03:24:59.537
This is work for a butcher,
not a Pharaoh.

2352
03:25:00.580 --> 03:25:02.790
Destroy them all.

2353
03:25:02.958 --> 03:25:05.084
But bring Moses to me alive.

2354
03:25:05.252 --> 03:25:08.337
Level spears! Forward!

2355
03:25:43.290 --> 03:25:46.959
- Here! Take him!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!

2356
03:26:05.479 --> 03:26:07.730
Grandfather, look,
the horses are coming!

2357
03:26:07.898 --> 03:26:11.692
The chariots!
Run! Run! Run for your lives!

2358
03:26:22.996 --> 03:26:25.664
Better to serve the Egyptians
than to die here!

2359
03:26:25.832 --> 03:26:29.627
Who shall withstand
the power of God?

2360
03:27:22.556 --> 03:27:26.100
Thou didst blow with thy winds,

2361
03:27:27.018 --> 03:27:29.520
and the sea covered them!

2362
03:27:31.356 --> 03:27:34.233
Who is like unto thee, O Lord?

2363
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:38.404
From everlasting to everlasting,

2364
03:27:39.322 --> 03:27:41.407
Thou art God!

2365
03:27:41.575 --> 03:27:46.579
The Lord is one! The Lord is one!

2366
03:28:28.455 --> 03:28:30.998
Before you strike,

2367
03:28:31.166 --> 03:28:34.293
show me his blood on your sword.

2368
03:28:46.556 --> 03:28:49.725
You couldn't even kill him.

2369
03:28:51.394 --> 03:28:55.814
His god... is God.

2370
03:29:06.409 --> 03:29:09.495
And Moses
led Israel from the Red Sea

2371
03:29:09.663 --> 03:29:12.414
into the wilderness of Sinai.

2372
03:29:12.582 --> 03:29:15.584
And they camped
before the holy mountain.

2373
03:29:15.752 --> 03:29:18.462
And when the people saw
that Moses delayed

2374
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:21.131
to come down out of the mountain,

2375
03:29:21.299 --> 03:29:24.510
they gathered themselves together.

2376
03:29:24.678 --> 03:29:29.348
Ask Aaron. Could anyone live on that
fiery summit for 40 days and 40 nights?

2377
03:29:29.516 --> 03:29:34.103
- Yes! By the will of God!
- Who knows the will of God?

2378
03:29:35.021 --> 03:29:38.524
Do you? Do I?

2379
03:29:38.692 --> 03:29:41.860
Or you, Sephora? His grieving wife.

2380
03:29:42.028 --> 03:29:44.113
She came back among us
to find her husband.

2381
03:29:44.281 --> 03:29:47.992
But he's dead. Even she
cannot hope that he lives!

2382
03:29:48.159 --> 03:29:52.454
Moses went up into the forbidden
ground to receive God's law!

2383
03:29:52.622 --> 03:29:55.249
Yes, but he's not returned!

2384
03:29:55.417 --> 03:29:59.461
We share your pain. We sympathize.

2385
03:29:59.629 --> 03:30:02.965
But will sympathy lead us to this land
flowing with milk and honey?

2386
03:30:03.133 --> 03:30:06.218
- Now, we have no leader!
- Don't be fooled!

2387
03:30:06.386 --> 03:30:08.804
Moses will return!

2388
03:30:10.181 --> 03:30:13.058
Would a God
who's shown you such wonders

2389
03:30:13.226 --> 03:30:15.811
let Moses die before his work is done?

2390
03:30:15.979 --> 03:30:18.689
- His work is done.
- His mother!

2391
03:30:18.857 --> 03:30:22.276
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!

2392
03:30:22.444 --> 03:30:25.279
But there are other mothers among you!

2393
03:30:25.447 --> 03:30:27.072
What will become of your children?

2394
03:30:29.409 --> 03:30:33.746
- We must have faith!
- Faith in what? You, Aaron?

2395
03:30:33.913 --> 03:30:37.583
Can you lead us to this land of promise?
Do you know where it is?

2396
03:30:37.751 --> 03:30:38.792
- Tell us!
- Where is it?

2397
03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:40.252
Across the wilderness!

2398
03:30:40.420 --> 03:30:42.421
- Then who is to lead us?
- You, Dathan!

2399
03:30:46.843 --> 03:30:49.178
Where could I bring you,
except to Egypt?

2400
03:30:49.346 --> 03:30:52.431
- Where there is death?
- No! Where there is food!

2401
03:30:52.599 --> 03:30:56.852
- Pharaoh would kill us all.
- Not if a god of Egypt went before us!

2402
03:30:57.020 --> 03:30:58.437
- You could make one for us, Aaron.
- No!

2403
03:30:58.605 --> 03:31:02.066
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!
- I will not!

2404
03:31:02.233 --> 03:31:05.319
He will not!

2405
03:31:05.487 --> 03:31:08.614
He would rather see our flesh
rot in the wilderness.

2406
03:31:09.699 --> 03:31:12.159
You will make a god for us!

2407
03:31:12.327 --> 03:31:15.454
A god of gold! A golden calf!

2408
03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:21.627
Korah shall be the high priest!

2409
03:31:23.922 --> 03:31:28.133
Bring baskets! Buckets! Shawls!
Anything you have!

2410
03:31:28.301 --> 03:31:32.721
Break off your earrings,
your bracelets, your necklaces!

2411
03:31:32.889 --> 03:31:35.641
We will make of them a golden calf!

2412
03:31:36.893 --> 03:31:40.354
- The golden spoils we took from Egypt!
- There!

2413
03:31:52.492 --> 03:31:54.493
Spoils of Egypt!

2414
03:32:06.464 --> 03:32:08.674
From the burning bush, O Lord,

2415
03:32:08.842 --> 03:32:12.886
you charged me to bring the people
to this holy mountain,

2416
03:32:13.054 --> 03:32:16.473
to behold your glory
and receive your law.

2417
03:32:17.225 --> 03:32:19.685
What have I left undone?

2418
03:32:27.485 --> 03:32:29.570
I am...

2419
03:32:31.698 --> 03:32:34.074
I am...

2420
03:32:35.577 --> 03:32:39.496
I am the Lord thy God.

2421
03:32:39.664 --> 03:32:44.334
Thou shalt have
no other gods before me.

2422
03:32:49.090 --> 03:32:54.303
Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image.

2423
03:33:06.399 --> 03:33:10.402
And they overlaid
the image with pure gold.

2424
03:33:10.570 --> 03:33:14.740
And Aaron fashioned it
and smoothed it with the hammer,

2425
03:33:14.908 --> 03:33:20.412
ready to be graven
by cunning art and man's device.

2426
03:33:20.580 --> 03:33:24.583
And he fastened it with nails
that it should not move.

2427
03:33:25.710 --> 03:33:28.212
And he that smote the anvil

2428
03:33:28.379 --> 03:33:32.174
did beat the molten gold
into thin plates.

2429
03:33:32.342 --> 03:33:36.345
For they had gathered their treasure
into the midst of the furnace,

2430
03:33:36.513 --> 03:33:40.933
and did blow the fire upon it
to melt it.

2431
03:33:41.100 --> 03:33:45.604
And they adorned themselves
in rich apparel and costly array,

2432
03:33:45.772 --> 03:33:49.107
with veils of blue
and purple and scarlet,

2433
03:33:49.275 --> 03:33:52.611
and fine-twined linen wrought in Egypt.

2434
03:33:52.779 --> 03:33:57.449
And the women tread grapes
from Midian into new wine.

2435
03:33:57.617 --> 03:34:00.244
Thou shall not take the name

2436
03:34:00.411 --> 03:34:04.540
of the Lord thy God in vain.

2437
03:34:08.086 --> 03:34:13.090
Remember the Sabbath day,
to keep it holy.

2438
03:34:18.137 --> 03:34:22.099
Honor thy father and thy mother.

2439
03:34:27.647 --> 03:34:30.566
Thou shalt not kill.

2440
03:34:43.496 --> 03:34:46.582
And the people
sinned a great sin,

2441
03:34:46.749 --> 03:34:49.876
for they had made them a god of gold.

2442
03:34:50.044 --> 03:34:53.714
And they bore him upon
their shoulders and rejoiced,

2443
03:34:53.881 --> 03:34:57.509
saying, "This be our god, O Israel."

2444
03:34:57.677 --> 03:35:01.930
Are you mourners of Moses afraid
to face the new god of gold?

2445
03:35:02.098 --> 03:35:05.684
They were as children
who had lost their faith.

2446
03:35:05.852 --> 03:35:11.231
They were perverse and crooked
and rebellious against God.

2447
03:35:11.399 --> 03:35:13.859
They did eat the bread of wickedness,

2448
03:35:14.027 --> 03:35:16.486
and drank the wine of violence,

2449
03:35:16.654 --> 03:35:19.781
and they did evil
in the eyes of the Lord.

2450
03:35:19.949 --> 03:35:24.453
And the people cried,
"The graven image hath brought us joy,"

2451
03:35:24.621 --> 03:35:29.791
and they worshipped the
golden calf and sacrificed unto it.

2452
03:35:29.959 --> 03:35:32.294
Here is your sacrifice!

2453
03:35:37.508 --> 03:35:41.345
Make way!
Make way for the sacrifice!

2454
03:36:25.556 --> 03:36:29.351
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

2455
03:36:35.525 --> 03:36:38.777
Thou shalt not steal.

2456
03:36:43.116 --> 03:36:46.868
Thou shalt not bear false witness

2457
03:36:47.036 --> 03:36:49.454
against thy neighbor.

2458
03:36:52.709 --> 03:36:56.545
Thou shalt not covet anything

2459
03:36:56.713 --> 03:36:58.839
that is thy neighbor's.

2460
03:37:26.617 --> 03:37:30.162
Written with the finger of God.

2461
03:37:40.006 --> 03:37:43.759
Go! Get thee down,

2462
03:37:43.926 --> 03:37:48.346
for thy people
have corrupted themselves.

2463
03:38:07.575 --> 03:38:10.160
And the people rose up to play,

2464
03:38:10.328 --> 03:38:12.412
and did eat and drink.

2465
03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:15.165
They were as the children of fools

2466
03:38:15.333 --> 03:38:17.375
and cast off their clothes.

2467
03:38:17.543 --> 03:38:19.920
The wicked were like a troubled sea

2468
03:38:20.087 --> 03:38:23.256
whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

2469
03:38:23.424 --> 03:38:25.675
They sank from evil to evil

2470
03:38:25.843 --> 03:38:28.094
and were viler than the earth.

2471
03:38:28.262 --> 03:38:30.722
And there was rioting and drunkenness,

2472
03:38:30.890 --> 03:38:33.350
for they had become servants of sin.

2473
03:38:33.518 --> 03:38:38.772
There was manifest all manner
of ungodliness and works of the flesh.

2474
03:38:38.940 --> 03:38:41.942
Even adultery and lasciviousness,

2475
03:38:42.109 --> 03:38:45.362
uncleanness, idolatry and rioting,

2476
03:38:45.530 --> 03:38:47.155
vanity and wrath.

2477
03:38:47.323 --> 03:38:51.910
And they were filled with iniquity
and vile affections.

2478
03:38:52.078 --> 03:38:56.414
And Aaron knew that he
had brought them to shame.

2479
03:39:00.253 --> 03:39:04.506
Abiram! Korah!
Bind the sacrifice with cord!

2480
03:39:04.674 --> 03:39:07.217
Even unto the horns of the altar!

2481
03:39:36.831 --> 03:39:40.083
The light of God
shines from you, Moses.

2482
03:39:41.127 --> 03:39:44.296
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.

2483
03:39:44.463 --> 03:39:47.299
These tablets of stone...

2484
03:39:47.466 --> 03:39:49.301
The writing of God.

2485
03:39:50.678 --> 03:39:53.054
His Ten Commandments.

2486
03:39:58.227 --> 03:40:01.187
There is a noise of war in the camp.

2487
03:40:01.355 --> 03:40:04.149
It is not the noise of war.

2488
03:40:04.317 --> 03:40:07.277
It is the noise of song and revelry.

2489
03:40:39.685 --> 03:40:42.520
- Moses!
- Look!

2490
03:40:43.856 --> 03:40:45.357
Joshua!

2491
03:40:45.524 --> 03:40:48.985
Woe unto thee, O Israel.

2492
03:40:49.153 --> 03:40:53.490
You have sinned a great sin
in the sight of God!

2493
03:40:54.283 --> 03:40:58.995
You are not worthy to receive
these Ten Commandments.

2494
03:40:59.163 --> 03:41:00.956
Aaron!

2495
03:41:10.341 --> 03:41:15.720
We are gathered against you, Moses!
You take too much upon yourself!

2496
03:41:15.888 --> 03:41:18.640
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!

2497
03:41:18.808 --> 03:41:22.894
There is no freedom without the law.

2498
03:41:23.062 --> 03:41:25.021
Whose law, Moses? Yours?

2499
03:41:25.189 --> 03:41:28.191
Did you carve those tablets
to become a prince over us?

2500
03:41:30.444 --> 03:41:33.989
Who is on the Lord's side,

2501
03:41:34.156 --> 03:41:37.701
- let him come to me!
- I am!

2502
03:41:44.041 --> 03:41:45.000
Moses!

2503
03:41:45.167 --> 03:41:48.837
Moses! Moses!

2504
03:41:49.005 --> 03:41:52.632
- You have cursed us.
- These people made me.

2505
03:41:54.677 --> 03:41:58.388
Joshua! Joshua!

2506
03:42:03.394 --> 03:42:08.064
He showed you no land flowing with milk
and honey! I show you a god of gold!

2507
03:42:08.232 --> 03:42:10.233
Come with me! Follow me!

2508
03:42:10.401 --> 03:42:13.403
Blasphemers! Idolaters!

2509
03:42:13.571 --> 03:42:18.116
For this you shall drink bitter waters!

2510
03:42:18.284 --> 03:42:21.619
God has set before you this day

2511
03:42:21.787 --> 03:42:25.457
his laws of life and good

2512
03:42:25.624 --> 03:42:28.752
and death and evil.

2513
03:42:30.087 --> 03:42:33.298
Those who will not live by the law...

2514
03:42:35.426 --> 03:42:38.428
...shall die by the law!

2515
03:43:06.040 --> 03:43:09.501
And the Lord's anger
was kindled against Israel.

2516
03:43:09.668 --> 03:43:13.338
And to prove whether they would
keep his commandments or no,

2517
03:43:13.506 --> 03:43:18.468
he made them wander
in the wilderness 40 years,

2518
03:43:18.636 --> 03:43:22.680
until all the generation that
had done evil in the sight of the Lord

2519
03:43:22.848 --> 03:43:25.350
was consumed.

2520
03:43:25.518 --> 03:43:31.356
But Moses' eye was not dim,
nor his natural force abated.

2521
03:43:31.524 --> 03:43:35.443
And he went up from the plains
of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo,

2522
03:43:35.611 --> 03:43:38.113
and the Lord showed him all the land

2523
03:43:38.280 --> 03:43:42.033
that was beyond the river Jordan.

2524
03:43:42.201 --> 03:43:43.743
The Lord was angry with me

2525
03:43:43.911 --> 03:43:47.705
because I disobeyed him
by the waters of strife.

2526
03:43:47.873 --> 03:43:52.544
And he said unto me,
"Behold the new land with thine eyes.

2527
03:43:52.711 --> 03:43:56.631
For thou shalt not cross
over this river Jordan."

2528
03:43:56.799 --> 03:43:59.175
Then I shall stay.

2529
03:43:59.343 --> 03:44:04.139
I am called by the Lord, Sephora.
I go alone.

2530
03:44:04.306 --> 03:44:06.307
Look, Moses.

2531
03:44:06.475 --> 03:44:09.352
The people have come
to the river Jordan.

2532
03:44:10.938 --> 03:44:15.108
In the Ark, they carry
the law you brought them.

2533
03:44:15.276 --> 03:44:19.070
You taught them
not to live by bread alone.

2534
03:44:19.238 --> 03:44:24.075
You are God's torch,
that lights the way to freedom.

2535
03:44:26.745 --> 03:44:28.454
I love you.

2536
03:44:32.459 --> 03:44:34.002
Joshua...

2537
03:44:45.222 --> 03:44:49.434
Joshua, I charge you
and strengthen you,

2538
03:44:49.602 --> 03:44:53.396
for you shall go over Jordan
to lead the people.

2539
03:44:55.691 --> 03:44:59.736
As for me and my house,
we shall serve the Lord.

2540
03:45:01.488 --> 03:45:04.616
Mered, give me the books.

2541
03:45:05.784 --> 03:45:10.747
Eleazar, set these five books

2542
03:45:10.915 --> 03:45:12.457
in the Ark of the Covenant,

2543
03:45:12.625 --> 03:45:15.210
by the tablets
of the Ten Commandments,

2544
03:45:15.377 --> 03:45:18.129
which the Lord restored unto us.

2545
03:45:32.311 --> 03:45:34.145
Go.

2546
03:45:34.313 --> 03:45:37.690
Proclaim liberty
throughout all the lands,

2547
03:45:37.858 --> 03:45:41.152
unto all the inhabitants thereof.
