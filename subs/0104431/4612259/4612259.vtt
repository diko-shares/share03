Anyone seen my sun block?

4
00:02:24.047 --> 00:02:27.039
What's the point of going to Florida
if you use sun block?

5
00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.886
I don't care, I'm getting toasted.

6
00:02:30.127 --> 00:02:33.756
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a darker shade of skin.

7
00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:38.165
He's jealous because he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

20

Oh, did you see what Grandma sent you?

21
00:03:10.847 --> 00:03:13.361
Let me guess. Donald Duck slippers?

22
00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.237
Close.

23
00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:18.276
Inflatable clown to play with
in the pool.

24
00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:19.522
How exciting.

25
00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:24.119
Why Florida? There's no
Christmas trees in Florida.

26
00:03:24.327 --> 00:03:26.158
What is it with Christmas trees?

27
00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.200
How can you have Christmas
without a Christmas tree?

28
00:03:29.407 --> 00:03:32.956
We'll find a nice fake silver one.
Or decorate a palm tree.

34
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:07.166
Oh, much better.

35
00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:11.203
Kevin, put your tie on. We'll be
late for the Christmas pageant.

36
00:04:11.447 --> 00:04:15.440
It's in the bathroom. I can't go in.
Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

37
00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:20.243
He says if I walk in there and see him
naked, I'd never feel like a real man.

38
00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:22.762
Whatever that means.

39
00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:28.955
I'm sure he was kidding.
Just run in and get your tie...

40
00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:31.283

at anything.

- What?

Immature or not, it was
pretty darn hilarious.

00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:10.278
I also apologize to my brother.

I'm not sorry. I did it
because Muzz humiliated me.

so I got him.

101
00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:42.484
Last time we tried to take a trip,
we had a problem just like this.

Yeah, with me getting crapped on.

I don't care for your choice of words.
That's not what happened.

104
00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:51.163
Muzz apologized to you.

105
00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:53.597
Yeah, then he called me
a trout-sniffer.

106
00:08:53.847 --> 00:08:56.520
He didn't mean it.
He was just sucking up to you.

107
00:08:56.967 --> 00:09:00.676
Okay, why don't you just sit up here
and think things over?

108
00:09:00.927 --> 00:09:04.397
When you're ready to apologize
to everyone, you can come down.

109
00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:07.963
I'm not apologizing to Muzz.
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat!

110
00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:10.638
Then stay up here all night.

111

money, I'd go on my own vacation.

113

have the most fun of my whole life.

your dad, when he arrives...

347
00:29:24.967 --> 00:29:27.765
...he must come down and
sign a couple of things.

348
00:29:27.967 --> 00:29:31.084
- Thank you, you've been helpful.
CEDRIC: May I take your bag?

349
00:29:35.687 --> 00:29:37.166
Up here to your left.

350
00:29:37.927 --> 00:29:40.487
Herbert Hoover
once stayed on this floor.

351
00:29:40.727 --> 00:29:42.001
The vacuum guy?

352
00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:44.363
No, the president.

353
00:29:49.047 --> 00:29:51.766
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

354
00:29:59.447 --> 00:30:01.165
This is great!

355
00:30:06.327 --> 00:30:09.763
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

356
00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:18.920
Luxurious and spacious.

357
00:30:24.847 --> 00:30:26.075
How convenient.

358
00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:30.755
Hey.

359
00:30:33.047 --> 00:30:36.562
Did you want the key in the bag?
Or did you want to hang on to it?

360
00:30:36.807 --> 00:30:38.126
I'll hang on to it.

361
00:30:41.527 --> 00:30:42.960
Everything all right?

362
00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:45.397
- Is the temperature okay?
- It's okay.

363
00:30:45.767 --> 00:30:49.316
- Do you know how the TV works?
- I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.

364
00:30:50.447 --> 00:30:51.766
Well...

365
00:30:55.447 --> 00:30:56.436
I'm sorry.

366
00:31:01.647 --> 00:31:04.207
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

367
00:31:06.487 --> 00:31:07.761
Thank you.

368
00:31:34.207 --> 00:31:36.596
Would you mind if I worked
on my cannonballs?

369
00:31:37.367 --> 00:31:38.277
No.

370
00:31:39.087 --> 00:31:39.883
Thanks.

371
00:31:53.007 --> 00:31:54.360
KEVIN:
Yikes!

372
00:32:14.887 --> 00:32:17.196
This is a vacation.

373
00:32:18.087 --> 00:32:19.566
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

374
00:32:20.287 --> 00:32:21.845
<i>It's me, Johnny.</i>

375
00:32:22.047 --> 00:32:23.526
<i>I knew it was you.</i>

376
00:32:23.887 --> 00:32:26.401
<i>I could smell you getting off</i>
<i>the elevator.</i>

377
00:32:27.767 --> 00:32:31.316
- Two scoops, sir?
- Two? Make it three, I'm not driving.

378
00:32:31.527 --> 00:32:35.406
DAME: <i>Gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.</i>
- Thank you.

379
00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:37.962
<i>You was here last night too,</i>
<i>wasn 't you?</i>

380
00:32:38.767 --> 00:32:40.962
<i>I was singing at the Blue Monkey</i>
<i>last night.</i>

381
00:32:41.167 --> 00:32:43.476
She was not.
She was smooching your brother.

382
00:32:43.887 --> 00:32:47.357
<i>You was here and you was</i>
<i>smooching with my brother.</i>

383
00:32:47.567 --> 00:32:49.125
DAME: <i>That's a dirty lie.</i>
- See?

384
00:32:49.327 --> 00:32:52.080
<i>Don 't give me that.</i>
<i>You been smooching everybody!</i>

385
00:32:52.327 --> 00:32:54.761
<i>Snuffy, Al, Leo...</i>

386
00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:59.199
<i>... Little Moe with the gimpy leg,</i>
<i>Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...</i>

387
00:32:59.407 --> 00:33:01.125
<i>I could go on forever, baby.</i>

388
00:33:01.367 --> 00:33:02.925
DAME:
<i>You have me all wrong!</i>

389
00:33:03.167 --> 00:33:04.077
JOHNNY:
<i>All right...</i>

390
00:33:04.287 --> 00:33:05.515
<i>... I believe you.</i>

391
00:33:05.767 --> 00:33:07.962
<i>But my Tommy gun don 't!</i>

392
00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:09.681
<i>Johnny!</i>

393
00:33:10.247 --> 00:33:11.999
<i>You're the only duck in my pond!</i>

394
00:33:12.207 --> 00:33:14.767
<i>Get down on your knees</i>
<i>and tell me you love me.</i>

395
00:33:14.967 --> 00:33:17.686
DAME:
<i>Baby! I'm over the moon for you!</i>

396
00:33:17.887 --> 00:33:19.639
<i>You gotta do better than that!</i>

397
00:33:20.367 --> 00:33:25.202
<i>If my love was an ocean, Lindy'd have</i>
<i>to take two planes to get across it.</i>

398
00:33:26.567 --> 00:33:29.479
<i>Maybe I'm off my hinges,</i>
<i>but I believe you.</i>

399
00:33:30.367 --> 00:33:32.164
<i>That's why I'm letting you go.</i>

400
00:33:32.567 --> 00:33:36.446
<i>I'm gonna give you till the count</i>

<i>... lowdown, four-flushing carcass</i>
<i>out my door!</i>

403
00:33:42.127 --> 00:33:43.685
She's rat bait.

404
00:33:43.967 --> 00:33:44.843
<i>One!</i>

405
00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:46.963
<i>Two!</i>

406
00:33:51.727 --> 00:33:55.163
(LAUGHING)

407
00:33:55.647 --> 00:33:56.443
<i>Three!</i>

408
00:33:57.167 --> 00:33:59.920
<i>Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.</i>

409
00:34:01.887 --> 00:34:03.718
<i>And a Happy New Year.</i>

410
00:34:35.447 --> 00:34:36.402
Housekeeping.

411
00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:20.079
FRANK OVER RECORDER:
<i>We know a guy who can do the cool jerk</i>

412
00:35:21.247 --> 00:35:25.320
<i>We know a guy who can do the cool jerk</i>

413
00:35:25.567 --> 00:35:28.877
<i>This cat they're talkin ' about</i>

414
00:35:29.087 --> 00:35:31.601
<i>I wonder who could it be</i>

415
00:35:31.847 --> 00:35:34.645
<i>'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat</i>

416
00:35:34.887 --> 00:35:37.685
<i>The heaviest cat you ever did see</i>

417
00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:40.487
<i>When they see me</i>
<i>Walkin ' down the street</i>

418
00:35:40.727 --> 00:35:43.287
<i>None of the fellas want to speak</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

419
00:35:43.487 --> 00:35:46.240
<i>On their faces they wear a silly smirk</i>
<i>'Cause they know</i>

420
00:35:46.487 --> 00:35:50.639
<i>I'm the king of the cool jerks</i>

421
00:35:54.287 --> 00:35:57.597
<i>Get out of here, you pervert,</i>
<i>or I'll slap you silly!</i>

422
00:35:58.127 --> 00:35:59.116
Uh...

423
00:36:01.567 --> 00:36:03.876
<i>Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.</i>

424
00:36:05.967 --> 00:36:07.480
Oh, my foot!

425
00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:41.481
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

426
00:36:58.167 --> 00:36:59.236
Uncle Rob lives here.

427
00:36:59.807 --> 00:37:02.685
If they're back from Paris,
I'll drop in on them.

428
00:37:02.967 --> 00:37:05.481
They usually give pretty
good presents.

429
00:38:02.487 --> 00:38:03.886
Good night, Mom.

430
00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.879
Good night, Kevin.

431
00:38:36.767 --> 00:38:38.359
Your drawers, sir.

432
00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:43.197
Don't flash these babies around here!
There could be girls on this floor!

433
00:38:43.407 --> 00:38:45.045
I was very careful, sir.

434
00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:47.881
You can't be too careful
with underwear.

435
00:38:48.087 --> 00:38:49.202
I understand.

436
00:38:49.887 --> 00:38:52.162
I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

437
00:38:52.767 --> 00:38:56.601
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.

438
00:38:58.167 --> 00:38:59.282
No tip?

439
00:38:59.647 --> 00:39:00.875
Okay.

440
00:39:01.887 --> 00:39:04.082
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

441
00:39:07.167 --> 00:39:09.681
The doorman will be happy
to find you a taxi...

442
00:39:10.367 --> 00:39:11.197
Mr. McCallister.

443
00:39:14.487 --> 00:39:15.761
Excuse me.

444
00:39:15.967 --> 00:39:17.082
Sure.

445
00:39:20.247 --> 00:39:22.078
And how are we this morning?

446
00:39:22.327 --> 00:39:25.319
- Fine. Is my transportation here?
- Out in front, sir.

447
00:39:25.567 --> 00:39:27.876
A limousine and a pizza.

448
00:39:28.087 --> 00:39:29.679
Compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

449
00:39:30.327 --> 00:39:33.125
I do hope your father understands
that last night...

450
00:39:33.367 --> 00:39:36.757
...I was simply checking to see
that everything was in order.

451
00:39:36.967 --> 00:39:38.480
Oh, he was pretty mad.

452
00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:39.722
He was?

453
00:39:39.927 --> 00:39:43.237
He said he didn't come here
to have his naked rear spied on.

454
00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:45.400
Of course not.

455
00:39:45.647 --> 00:39:47.524
Will he be down soon?

456
00:39:47.767 --> 00:39:48.882
He already left.

457
00:39:51.567 --> 00:39:54.559
I would've liked to have offered
my personal apology.

458
00:39:54.967 --> 00:39:58.004
If a guy saw you in the shower,
would you want to see him?

459
00:39:58.767 --> 00:40:00.200
I suppose not.

460
00:40:00.487 --> 00:40:02.398
I don't think you'll see him again.

461
00:40:03.327 --> 00:40:04.316
I understand.

462
00:40:05.887 --> 00:40:07.081
Mye.

463
00:40:09.567 --> 00:40:11.285
Have a lovely day.

464
00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:22.203
McCallister...

465
00:40:34.567 --> 00:40:37.081
- Good morning, Mr. McCallister.
- Morning.

466
00:40:44.127 --> 00:40:47.119
Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own...

467
00:40:47.367 --> 00:40:48.880
...cheese pizza.

468
00:41:09.887 --> 00:41:12.037
- Hello?
- Hello.

469
00:41:12.247 --> 00:41:13.600
Know any good toy stores?

470
00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:15.566
Yes, sir.

471
00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:27.921
Ahh.

472
00:41:32.967 --> 00:41:34.286
Mingo!

473
00:41:48.967 --> 00:41:51.925
Get outta here! Go on, get
outta here! Get outta here!

474
00:41:52.127 --> 00:41:54.277
Meat it! Meat it! Get outta here!

475
00:41:54.527 --> 00:41:58.076
Hey, Marv! Get over here!
I gotta talk to you!

476
00:42:07.847 --> 00:42:09.280
Whoa, whoa!

477
00:42:11.647 --> 00:42:15.003
- Would you like a scarf?
- Forget about that, we gotta talk.

478
00:42:16.287 --> 00:42:20.360
We don't have the equipment to pull off
anything big: Manks, jewelry stores...

479
00:42:20.967 --> 00:42:24.721
We don't want goods.
We need cash and we need it now.

480
00:42:24.927 --> 00:42:26.121
How about...

481
00:42:26.367 --> 00:42:27.516
...hotels?

482
00:42:27.767 --> 00:42:29.405
Tourists carry lots of cash.

483
00:42:29.607 --> 00:42:34.317
I got a better idea. Stores ain't
depositing cash on Christmas Eve.

484
00:42:34.767 --> 00:42:39.522
The stores that will have cash are the
ones dealing in moderate priced goods.

485
00:42:39.767 --> 00:42:40.916
Right. Right.

486
00:42:41.167 --> 00:42:44.716
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve...

487
00:42:44.967 --> 00:42:46.685
...that nobody's gonna rob?

488
00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:48.556
Candy stores.

489
00:42:49.847 --> 00:42:51.724
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores.

490
00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:54.485
This is what I had in mind:

491
00:42:56.647 --> 00:42:59.241
That's brilliant, Harry! Mrilliant!

492
00:43:01.487 --> 00:43:05.082
Nobody's dumb enough to knock off
a toy store on Christmas Eve.

493
00:43:05.287 --> 00:43:07.084
Oh, yes, there is.

494
00:43:24.487 --> 00:43:27.877
DRIVER:
Here we are, sir: Duncan's Toy Chest.

495
00:43:28.767 --> 00:43:30.883
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

496
00:43:37.847 --> 00:43:40.042
(TRAIN WHISTLE MLOWS)

00:44:04.847 --> 00:44:09.682
(TO Y CLICKING)

498
00:44:11.727 --> 00:44:14.446
This is the greatest accident
of my life.

499
00:44:32.047 --> 00:44:33.924
Marv. Marv!

500
00:44:34.167 --> 00:44:37.079
Hey, nice house.
Mut there's no bathroom in it.

501
00:44:39.767 --> 00:44:40.882
So, what's the plan?

502
00:44:41.087 --> 00:44:45.558
Everyone leaves for a holiday off.
We come out of our houses.

503
00:44:48.927 --> 00:44:49.882
Yeah, then what?

504
00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:52.317
We empty the registers and walk out.

505
00:44:52.567 --> 00:44:54.478
Great plan, Harry!

506
00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:58.286
MR. DUNCAN: Well, now, thank you
and Merry Christmas.

507
00:44:58.487 --> 00:45:00.478
Say hello to the family.

508
00:45:03.087 --> 00:45:04.679
Let me see.

509
00:45:06.567 --> 00:45:07.841
You shopping alone?

510
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:11.159
In New York?
Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow.

511
00:45:11.767 --> 00:45:14.679
- I was just checking.
- That's very responsible of you.

512
00:45:14.927 --> 00:45:16.280
Oh, well, thank you.

513
00:45:16.527 --> 00:45:17.926
My pleasure.

514
00:45:18.167 --> 00:45:22.479
That'll be $23.75.

515
00:45:24.047 --> 00:45:26.561
My, my, my.
Where did you get all that money?

516
00:45:28.727 --> 00:45:30.877
- I have a lot of grandmothers.
- Oh.

517
00:45:31.527 --> 00:45:33.085
Well, that explains it.

518
00:45:35.127 --> 00:45:39.279
This is a nice store. One of the
finer toy dealerships I've visited.

Well, thank you.

520
00:45:40.687 --> 00:45:42.564
Mr. Duncan must be a nice guy...

521
00:45:42.767 --> 00:45:45.725
...letting kids come in here
and play with his toys.

522
00:45:45.967 --> 00:45:47.798
Most toy stores prohibit that.

523
00:45:48.007 --> 00:45:49.122
- Is that so?
- Yes.

524
00:45:49.367 --> 00:45:51.517
Well, he loves kids.

525
00:45:51.767 --> 00:45:55.726
As a matter of fact, all the money
the store takes in today...

526
00:45:55.967 --> 00:45:59.004
...Mr. Duncan is donating
to the Children's Hospital.

527
00:45:59.207 --> 00:46:01.243
And the day after Christmas...

528
00:46:01.447 --> 00:46:04.484
...we empty out all the money
in the cash register...

529
00:46:04.687 --> 00:46:07.724
...and Mr. Duncan takes it
right down to the hospital.

530
00:46:08.087 --> 00:46:09.315
That's generous of him.

531
00:46:09.527 --> 00:46:12.724
Well, children bring him
a lot of joy...

532
00:46:12.967 --> 00:46:16.084
...as they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

533
00:46:21.567 --> 00:46:26.322
I'm not supposed to spend this, but
I have $20 in a jar in our garage...

534
00:46:26.527 --> 00:46:30.315
...where my brother can't find it.
So I can pay my mother back.

535
00:46:30.567 --> 00:46:34.401
So give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.

536
00:46:34.607 --> 00:46:38.998
Mesides, I'll probably spend it on
stuff that will rot my teeth and mind.

That's very sweet of you.

Well, to show our appreciation
for your generosity...

540

from that tree...

544

547
00:47:12.087 --> 00:47:15.716
...and give the other one
to a very special person.

548
00:47:16.287 --> 00:47:18.084
You see, turtledoves...

549
00:47:18.567 --> 00:47:21.479
...are a symbol of friendship
and love.

550
00:47:21.767 --> 00:47:25.077
Now, as long as each of you
have your turtledove...

551

who cares if it gets broken?

maybe it'll be like my Rollerblades.

01:48:12.247 --> 01:48:15.603
...I think it only fair that Kevin
get to open the first gift.

1224
01:48:16.967 --> 01:48:19.561
Then I'll go and the rest
of you and so on.

1225
01:48:23.927 --> 01:48:25.485
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1226
01:48:26.207 --> 01:48:28.118
Merry Christmas, Muzz.

1227
01:48:30.167 --> 01:48:31.646
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1228
01:48:33.007 --> 01:48:35.043
All right! Merry Christmas!

1229
01:48:37.207 --> 01:48:38.196
Enough gooey sh...

1230
01:48:39.127 --> 01:48:41.687
Show of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!

1231
01:48:44.327 --> 01:48:48.161
LESLIE: Everybody, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

1232
01:49:22.767 --> 01:49:24.519
Merry Christmas.

1233
01:49:26.647 --> 01:49:27.602
Kevin!

1234
01:49:27.807 --> 01:49:29.399
Merry Christmas!

1235
01:49:30.207 --> 01:49:31.481
I got something for you.

1236
01:49:39.647 --> 01:49:40.602
What's this?

1237
01:49:41.207 --> 01:49:43.846
It's a turtledove. I have one.
You have one.

1238
01:49:44.087 --> 01:49:47.716
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

1239
01:49:51.567 --> 01:49:54.001
Oh, Kevin.

1240
01:49:56.687 --> 01:49:58.086
Thank you.

1241
01:49:59.487 --> 01:50:02.047
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1242
01:50:28.967 --> 01:50:30.878
The room service bill, sir.

1243
01:50:33.127 --> 01:50:34.446
Merry Christmas.

1244
01:50:35.687 --> 01:50:37.200
Uh, oh.

1245
01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.041
Nice family.

1246
01:50:42.287 --> 01:50:43.322
Really.

1247
01:50:52.287 --> 01:50:53.800
Merry Christmas indeed.

1248
01:50:57.487 --> 01:50:58.806
PETER:
Kevin!

1249
01:50:59.047 --> 01:51:01.720
You spent $967 on room service?!
