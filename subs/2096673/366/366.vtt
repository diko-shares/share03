1
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:03,758
Great rehearsal, you guys.

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,156
-Hey, thanks.
-Bring it on.

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:06,875
l can't believe
we're actually going to be performing

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,552
for the President of the United States.
This is so cool!

5
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:13,795
Did you see that?

6
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:17,279
The new guy touched me.
Didn't anybody tell him?

7
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:21,794
Hello! Never touch the star.
Never, ever, ever.

8
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,037
Gotcha.

9
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:30,080
We do that to all the new dancers.
Hope you're not mad at me.

10
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:33,160
Try totally humiliated.
l'm so out of here.

11
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:35,080
-Jeremy.
-Gotcha back.

12
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:37,951
You're good.

13
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,801
Good enough to go
to a movie with tonight?

14
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:43,038
-l'd like that.
-Me, too.

15
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,481
l'm in the mood for a comedy

16
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:49,196
or maybe something
where Taye Diggs takes his shirt off.

17
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:51,313
Either one works for me.

18
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:55,353
Jeremy, this is my bodyguard, Roxy.

19
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:59,999
That's right, and it's my job to protect
Hannah Montana from danger,

20
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:03,194
all kinds of danger.
Know what l'm saying, dancer boy?

21
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,881
l think you do.

22
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:15,635
<i>come on!</i>

23
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:18,117
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

24
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:23,159
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe</i>
<i>every colour</i>

25
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:26,753
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

26
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:31,316
<i>lt's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

27
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,280
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

28
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:40,358
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

29
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:44,876
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

30
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:46,800
<i>chill it out, take it slow</i>

31
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,515
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

32
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

33
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,555
<i>Mix it all together</i>

34
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:57,959
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

35
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,839
So, how was the date?

36
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:10,634
Mine or hers?

37
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:15,800
Free refills,
Taye took his shirt off twice.

38
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:19,119
l'd give it two thumbs up,
but l don't wanna let go of my bucket.

39
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,995
Dad, he is never
gonna ask me out again.

40
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:26,634
Honey, you say that about every boy
you and Roxy date.

41
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:30,881
Do l even need to tell you
what's wrong with that sentence?

42
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:35,037
Sense of humour,
that's gonna help you later in life.

43
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:38,957
Now, you are singing
for the President tomorrow.

44
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,039
You need to get your rest,
and l need to go home

45
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,153
and find my bullet-proof pantyhose.

46
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:47,163
Keeps bullets out, keeps Roxy in.

47
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:52,396
Dad, this night was a disaster.

48
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:57,111
l'm sure it wasn't that bad.
l bet the boy had a good time.

49
00:02:57,163 --> 00:03:00,872
Dad, Roxy put a bell around his arm.

50
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,391
So every time he tried to make a move,
it went...

51
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:09,156
Exactly how many times
did the boy ''ding''?

52
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:10,431
lt doesn't matter, Daddy.

53
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:14,442
Every time he went ''ding,''
she went, ''Don't,'' and l went, ''Dang!''

54
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:19,116
Well, honey, Roxy's just doing her job.
To be honest with you, l agree with her,

55
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,278
'cause when it comes to girls,

56
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:23,440
boys will say
and do just about anything.

57
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,917
No, no, Julie. l'm serious.

58
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,557
l am a professional motocross racer.

59
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:33,839
Heck, yeah.
l'm working on my bike right now.

60
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,558
Listen to that engine purr.

61
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,074
Julie? Julie?

62
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,597
Man, how could she not believe me?

63
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,840
l'm guessing you purÃ©ed
when you should've liquefied.

64
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,316
Of course.

65
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:58,001
Dad, not all boys are like that.
l bet you didn't lie to girls.

66
00:03:58,043 --> 00:04:01,160
Well, honey,
when you got a head of hair like this,

67
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:03,000
you don't have to.

68
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,479
<i>Everybody makes mistakes</i>

69
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:15,919
<i>Everybody has those days</i>

70
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,194
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

71
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:20,881
<i>Everybody makes mistakes</i>

72
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,720
<i>Everybody has those days</i>

73
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,674
<i>Everybody knows what</i>
<i>what l'm talking about</i>

74
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,793
<i>Everybody gets that way</i>

75
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,761
l have a visual on Montana.
Repeat, l have a visual on Montana.

76
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,919
Yes, l'll get her autograph, Mom.

77
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,036
Bring in the President.

78
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,962
Wow, the President! Sushi. Lola likey.

79
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,195
Mr President, Sophie,

80
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:52,474
l'd like to introduce you to my daughter,
Hannah Montana.

81
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,798
Hold, please. And go.

82
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:59,675
And we're clear.

83
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:03,511
l can't believe
l'm meeting Hannah Montana.

84
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:06,157
l can't believe
l'm meeting America's angel.

85
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:08,353
As leader of the free world,

86
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:13,397
may l say your concert was off the hook
and you were the bomb?

87
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:17,036
Daddy, keep it real or keep it quiet.

88
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,518
What?
Just because l live in the White Hizzle

89
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:22,872
doesn't mean l got no sizzle.

90
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:26,793
Don't worry, sweetie.
All dads are embarrassing.

91
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:30,872
Yeah, but yours never stopped
a motorcade because he saw a horsey.

92
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:34,872
Now, Sophie,
horses have owners and owners vote,

93
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:37,434
and l got to feed him a carrot.

94
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,758
Don't you love it when those big,
fat hairy lips

95
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:42,112
just tickle the palm of your hand?

96
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:43,676
That's my favourite part.

97
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:48,321
Sushi! President likey.

98
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:53,233
Watch this.
The Japanese ambassador loves this.

99
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,156
Roxy, what are you doing?

100
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,671
Really, there's enough for everyone.

101
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:16,881
Enough to get you sick.

102
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:20,518
l'm sorry, sir, but what we have here
is a case of fish gone funky.

103
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:22,155
Excuse me?

104
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:25,115
Oh, boy.
The salmon's coming back upstream.

105
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:31,002
Amazing.

106
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:34,720
A nose like that
should be working for the

107
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:37,357
President of the United States.

108
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:40,279
l'm honoured, sir,
but l can't leave Hannah.

109
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:42,154
-Sure you can.
-What?

110
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:44,919
l mean,

111
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:48,352
you cannot pass up
an opportunity like this.

112
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:52,521
He's the President of the United States.

113
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:57,318
Not bad! Up top, Miss Montana!

114
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:59,240
Up top, Mr Prez.

115
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:06,918
But, Roxy, your country needs
your keen sense of smell.

116
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:10,473
l mean, sour milk, bad bologna?

117
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:14,072
This honker is the only thing
that can keep your President

118
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:17,081
on the job and off the john.

119
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:23,314
l can appreciate that, but l still
don't think that l should, you know...

120
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:30,040
Whee doggies!
That's a nice outfit, Son.

121
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,277
l hadn't seen that much leather

122
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:34,998
since your grandma got all gussied up
for singles' bingo.

123
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:40,152
Dad! Dad! Dad!

124
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:42,714
Now if you'll excuse me,

125
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:47,231
l'm on my way to Julie's to tell her
l just took fourth place in the big race.

126
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:50,002
Well, why not just tell her you won?

127
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,841
Because this way l don't even need
to show her a trophy.

128
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,601
Always thinking.

129
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,518
You see, Miley? lf l take that job,

130
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,794
who's gonna protect you
from boys who are ''always thinking''?

131
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:07,639
l mean, l've had your back
ever since we met down at Wig City.

132
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:14,080
No, no, no, no, no.

133
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:22,400
l don't think so.

134
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:28,160
All right, this is getting
to be downright painful.

135
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:30,034
l'll be right back.

136
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:37,515
-Now we cooking with gas.
-l love it!

137
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:41,876
Hey, Mile.
What do you think of this one?

138
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,679
l'm guessing you the daddy.

139
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,952
Don't worry. l'll help him next.

140
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:52,232
lt kind of looks like Aunt Pearl when
she gets back from the beauty shop.

141
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:59,639
l know,
and you've changed my life, too,

142
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,639
but let's face it, Roxy.

143
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:04,880
This schnoz is bigger
than the both of us.

144
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:10,393
-You want me to go, don't you?
-No, l don't.

145
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,640
Yes, you do,
'cause l'm all up in your business.

146
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:17,397
Look me in the eye
and tell me that isn't true.

147
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:21,842
Okay, fine it is. l'm a girl. l have needs.

148
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:28,111
Please tell me you just said
you're a girl who has knees.

149
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:32,315
Roxy, it's not that l want you to go.
l don't.

150
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,842
l just need a little space.

151
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:37,273
Sure. l give you a little space
and something happens to you.

152
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:39,236
That's not the way Roxy rolls.

153
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:41,558
Well, l'm tired of Roxy
rolling all over my life.

154
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:44,322
Hey, speaking of rolls,
why don't l heat up some sweet ones?

155
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,319
And then we can get all buttered up,

156
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:49,116
and we'll sit back
and be reasonable about this.

157
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:52,553
l don't need to be reasonable.
l just need to protect Hannah Montana,

158
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:55,197
and if l can't do it full-out Roxy,
l can't do it at all.

159
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,199
Well, then maybe you shouldn't.

160
00:09:57,243 --> 00:10:01,031
Well, if that's the way you want it,
then l'm happy to oblige.

161
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,233
Goodbye, Miss Montana.

162
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:08,796
l blame myself.

163
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,836
l should've offered up
my sticky buns sooner.

164
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,360
lt's not your fault, Daddy.

165
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:18,681
We'll find a bodyguard better
than Roxy. One that understands my

166
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,431
knees.

167
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,636
These babies, right here. Yeah.

168
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:30,239
So, tell us something about yourself

169
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:34,242
and what qualifies you
to be Hannah Montana's bodyguard.

170
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,035
l love your music.

171
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:41,394
l love what you stand for,
youth, innocence and fun,

172
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:45,878
and if anybody threatens that,
l'll rip their guts out

173
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:48,198
and feed them to the pigeons.

174
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:54,636
l'm the bodyguard you want!
l'm the bodyguard you need!

175
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:05,639
Thank you, Mr Annihilator.

176
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:12,913
There's a lot of bad <i>hombres</i> out there
looking to pump up the party.

177
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,716
Well, l got one question for them.

178
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,041
You got nerve?

179
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,958
Well, do you, punk? Do you?

180
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:30,717
Thank you, Mr Mysterious Stranger.

181
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:34,155
Well, that fits.

182
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:39,074
Let me make one thing
abundantly clear, princess.

183
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:42,395
Anybody comes within
spitting distance of you,

184
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:44,479
we're gonna have to go for a little ride

185
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:47,321
and maybe have a little conversation.
Agabish?

186
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:50,159
And what l'm gonna say is,

187
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:54,196
bada-bing, bada-boom,
end of story, forget about it.

188
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:58,472
Thank you, Mr...

189
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:03,234
-There's no name here.
-You don't need to know my name.

190
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,915
Well, Mile,
you've seen over 30 bodyguards.

191
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,194
-There must be one you like.
-There is,

192
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:15,757
and l kept seeing her
in everyone that came in.

193
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:18,237
-You miss Roxy, don't you?
-Yes.

194
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,879
l made a mistake, Dad.

195
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:24,472
l mean,
sometimes she gets on my last nerve,

196
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,955
but she's family.

197
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,880
Well, the President
doesn't leave town till tomorrow,

198
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:30,993
so you've got time to go to the hotel
and talk to her.

199
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,635
Come on, Dad.
She's never gonna come back

200
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:34,355
after the things l said.

201
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:38,442
You never know till you try, bud.
Stranger things have happened.

202
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:43,720
You got that right.

203
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:49,838
Come on, Julie. l swear.

204
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:53,159
l would have shown you the bike,
but l crashed it.

205
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:55,438
See, here's the handlebars.

206
00:12:56,563 --> 00:13:00,920
Come on, girl. Don't walk so fast.
l'm getting a thigh rash.

207
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:05,393
Rico, do a dude a favour.

208
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:08,196
Run down to the store
and get me some baby powder.

209
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:12,359
Jackson, l say this because l care.

210
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,314
You're pathetic!

211
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:24,919
The First Daughter was so excited
when you called.

212
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:29,516
Well, l thought teaching
America's angel one of my songs

213
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:32,236
would be a great way
to serve my country.

214
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:34,080
She's such a giver.

215
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:35,916
Sophie will be here momentarily.

216
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:38,761
Until then, you have permission
to play with the dolls.

217
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:42,392
lt's a lot of fun l've been told.

218
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,671
Okay.

219
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,280
While l'm waiting,
l think l'm just gonna go say hi

220
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,551
to one of my old bodyguards.

221
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:49,036
That's a negative.

222
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,880
-Are you sure?
-That's a positive.

223
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:53,312
l have orders to keep Hannah Montana
in this room.

224
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:56,753
Orders from a seven-year-old.
Tomorrow we go to Make a Moose.

225
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:04,757
Well, this is great.
Now, we're stuck in here.

226
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,193
No, Hannah's stuck in here.

227
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:15,075
-You don't have a clue, do you?
-Not one.

228
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,673
Hannah, check it out!

229
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:23,953
l look just like you.

230
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,319
Wow!

231
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:30,797
You look more like me than l do.

232
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:33,354
Let's learn that new song.

233
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:35,555
<i>Everybody makes mistakes</i>

234
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,753
<i>Everybody has those days</i>

235
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:42,757
Roxy?

236
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:46,480
Roxy? Roxy? Oh, boy.

237
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:51,194
There you are. Well, you're early.

238
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:53,352
l am?

239
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:57,352
Well, then why don't l just go away
and come back then? Toodles!

240
00:14:57,403 --> 00:15:00,361
Oh, no, no, no.
l know how in demand you are.

241
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:03,952
l hear you're the finest dog whisperer
on the West Coast.

242
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,121
Dog whisperer?

243
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,481
Poor Humphrey. He won't eat,

244
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:14,037
and he's sadder
than the vice President

245
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,438
when he heard l passed my physical.

246
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,273
Can you help him, please?

247
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:22,633
l'd love to,
but l just got an emergency call.

248
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:26,881
Bashful beagle in Beverly Hills.
So sad. Toodles.

249
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:33,834
Please. You're my last hope,

250
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:36,272
and l'm not asking as the President.

251
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,917
l'm asking as a loving dog owner,

252
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:42,035
who can get you a ride
on <i>Air Force One.</i>

253
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:45,680
Yes, Mr President.

254
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:51,592
l guess l'll just whisper to the dog.

255
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,676
Where's Roxy?

256
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,877
-What's that?
-Please.

257
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:03,677
Let me do my job.
l don't tell you how to run the country.

258
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,519
Point made. Carry on.

259
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:11,034
Yes. Yes.

260
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:14,598
l'll tell him. Okay.

261
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:17,840
He's sick of his dog food.
Kibble, kibble, kibble.

262
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:19,601
Boring!

263
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:22,234
You're amazing.

264
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,555
Can l get room service?

265
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:29,073
This is
the President of the United States.

266
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:31,762
Yes, l'll hold.

267
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:34,842
And so will you.

268
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:46,515
Well, look at that. There it is.
Looks delicious.

269
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:49,034
And we're back to toodles. See ya.

270
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,234
Well, no, no. Wait a second.
He's still not eating.

271
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:53,921
Okay, okay.

272
00:16:57,923 --> 00:17:01,233
Humphrey, all your favourites.

273
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:04,034
Boiled liver.

274
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:08,476
Ox tongue stew. Yeah.

275
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,963
Calf-brains fricassee.

276
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,076
l think he knows you're faking.

277
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,478
You have got to be kidding me.

278
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,631
l'd do it myself,
but l just had my teeth whitened,

279
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:27,072
and l can't afford a meat stain.

280
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:33,597
l'd better get a medal out of this.

281
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,517
That's some good liver.

282
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:58,437
<i>Nobody's perfect, no, nobody's perfect</i>

283
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:04,282
Are you sure you're Hannah Montana?

284
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:05,881
Why, of course l am.

285
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:08,721
Why would you ask
a silly question like that?

286
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,192
l don't know.

287
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:11,961
Because you stink on ice.

288
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:17,162
Well, what do you expect?
l didn't bring my lights.

289
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:19,080
l didn't bring my band.

290
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:21,512
Yeah, you didn't bring
your talent, either.

291
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:27,640
l just want the Hannah Montana
l saw on stage.

292
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,034
So do l, kid. So do l.

293
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:36,716
Come on. Eat, puppy, eat.

294
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,481
l'm begging you.

295
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:41,200
Why don't you try the brains?

296
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:44,280
lf l had any,
l wouldn't be here right now.

297
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,722
Mr President,
the dog whisperer is here.

298
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,958
Thank you, Agent Obvious.

299
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:57,079
Well, that's who's out...

300
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:00,355
Sweet niblets.

301
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:05,033
Mr President,
l don't know what's going on here,

302
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,118
but l have to tell you...

303
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,721
Wait! Wait, wait.

304
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,355
Humphrey has something
he wants to say.

305
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:11,473
l can't wait to hear this.

306
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,479
What's that, Humphrey?

307
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:16,311
The reason you haven't been eating

308
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,877
is because
you miss somebody terribly?

309
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:22,083
Well, why don't you just tell
that person?

310
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,836
You have, but they wouldn't answer
your phone calls.

311
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:28,839
l mean, listen to you.

312
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:33,762
Hold on.
l think l know what's going on here.

313
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,122
-You do?
-You do?

314
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:36,711
Of course.

315
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,881
My Humphrey-mumphrey misses me.

316
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:43,711
l've been so busy,
l've been ignoring you, haven't l, boy?

317
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:47,233
Now hold on, Mr President.
Maybe it wasn't your fault.

318
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:50,832
Maybe Humphrey was being
disobedient, stubborn

319
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:53,113
and a little bratty.

320
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:57,441
Oh, yeah? Well, Humphrey says
he was just trying to be a dog,

321
00:19:57,483 --> 00:20:00,316
and sometimes dogs
need to be let off their leash.

322
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:05,876
But what if that dog runs off
and gets itself into all kinds of trouble?

323
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:10,714
Well, you've got to trust
that you've trained it well enough

324
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:12,640
to know right from wrong.

325
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:14,275
And you have.

326
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:18,994
-What's that, buddy?
-He said he loves you.

327
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,598
And he knows that you love him, too.

328
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,474
l do. l do.

329
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,436
And we're going to be spending
a lot more time together, starting now.

330
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:31,642
Come on, buddy.
l saw a French poodle in the lobby,

331
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:34,641
and she's quite the hottie.
Come on. Come on.

332
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:39,435
-l do love you, Roxy.
-And l love you.

333
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:41,201
That's why l want to protect you.

334
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:44,280
l know, but maybe...

335
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,278
Maybe l do it
a little too much sometimes?

336
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:50,121
Roxy, l don't want you out of my life.

337
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:54,478
l just want you in it a smidge less.

338
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:58,159
And l know that's not
the way Roxy rolls, but maybe...

339
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:02,162
Child, you ate dog food for me.
Maybe l can bend a little for you.

340
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:04,394
So you're not gonna come
on dates with me any more?

341
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:07,162
No, l'm saying you just won't see me.

342
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:10,352
-l can live with that.
-So can l.

343
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:16,356
But what l can't live with
is that doggie breath. Stanky!

344
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,354
But you still cute.

345
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,399
Hey, Daddy, look who's back.

346
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:26,922
Of course l'm back.

347
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:28,715
The President and his daughter
are wonderful people,

348
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:30,719
but they're not family.

349
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:33,596
l was there two days, not a single hug.

350
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:37,317
Well, let me just take care
of that right now.

351
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,752
lt's good to have you back.

352
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:42,761
l'm not done.
Two whole days, Robby Ray!

353
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:47,955
Miley, why are you dressed up
like Lola?

354
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:51,596
Right, we had to switch
back at the hotel and...

355
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,479
Oh, no. Lilly!

356
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:59,159
Now we are going to do this
until we get it right.

357
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:02,521
-Now, one more time from the top.
-But...

358
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:08,158
-What's that, everyone?
-''Encore. Encore. More. More.''

359
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:13,072
You heard them.
Now five, six, seven, eight!

360
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,159
<i>Everybody makes mistakes</i>

361
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:17,353
<i>Everybody has those days</i>

362
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:22,877
-And l'm having one right now.
-At least you get to go home.
