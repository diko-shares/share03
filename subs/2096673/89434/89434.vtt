00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,670
Where's my sister?

7
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,030
Where's Kilico?

8
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,930
Kumotani...

9
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,360
Kilico's just a schoolgirl.
Let her go.

10
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,460
Let her go?

11
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,780
Kilina...

12
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,000
You're in no position to give me orders.

13
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,170
- Understand?
- OK!

14
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,130
Please... release her.

15
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,850
Let go of Kilico!

16
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,060
You're pathetic, Kilina.

17
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,800
Kilico!

18
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,800
Betrayal hurts...

19
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,320
Feel the pain to your bones!

20
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,540
I'll send you to hell...

21
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,710
I don't care how, but I will!

22
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,290
Hey, Kilico...

23
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,930
when I'm finished with this job,

24
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,360
we can go somewhere far away.

25
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,910
Really? When?

26
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,500
After your graduation.

27
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,070
Where will we go to?

28
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,050
America, Europe... it doesn't matter.

29
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,950
Somewhere we can live without
anyone bothering us.

30
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,480
All right...

31
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,330
That's not far off?

32
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
Very soon.

33
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:52,380
Sister...

34
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,250
Don't leave me alone.

35
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,530
Don't you leave me alone, kiddo.

36
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,190
I asked you not to leave me alone...

37
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,050
The operation was a complete success.

38
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,980
Has it been half a year already?

39
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,800
Yes, and now you're back.

40
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,660
Thank you, Doctor Shite.

41
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't mention it.

42
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,300
I just did what I was paid to do.

43
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,640
The downside is...

44
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,530
that I couldn't save both of you.

45
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,530
The trauma will be more psychological
than physical.

46
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,060
You need time to recuperate...

47
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,090
I have no time for that.

48
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,010
For these six months that man
has been alive.

49
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,930
It's unforgivable!

50
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,220
I knew you'd say that.

51
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,810
I'll recover in no time in this body.

52
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,630
I've found you, Kumotani!

53
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,960
Who... are you?

54
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,960
You don't recognise me?

55
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,690
You...

56
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,450
Modern medicine...

57
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,080
allows one body to be replaced
with that of another.

58
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,580
You...!

59
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,410
That scar...!

60
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,530
Betrayal hurts...

61
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,120
Feel the pain to your bones!

62
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,390
I'll send you to hell...

63
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,510
I don't care how, but I will!

64
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,500
- You...
- That's right.

65
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,410
I came back in my sister's body.

66
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,910
I'm Kilina.

67
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,660
I see...

68
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,180
Kilina, the female assassin who
betrayed us,

69
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,870
and was killed.

70
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,800
Killed by you, remember?

71
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,670
Sounds like you'd completely forgotten us.

72
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,090
This sword will help you to remember!

73
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,960
You...

74
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,010
You and I are the same.

75
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,410
I'm not a low life like you!

76
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,430
Revenge hurts too.

77
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,530
<i>Feel the pain to your bones!</i>

78
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,790
You're not Kumotani...
where is he?

79
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,740
That's what I said...

80
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,740
you and I are the same.

81
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,170
Where are you, Kumotani?!

82
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,640
You're Kilina, survived inside Kilico.

83
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,460
The female assassin who betrayed
us and was killed.

84
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,710
You're Kilina inside Kilico's body.

85
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,000
My brain is right up here.

86
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,550
Come and fight me!

87
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,190
Mr. Kumotani wanted to live in
many new bodies...

88
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,340
so I decided to use this one, too.

89
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:05,240
<i>KILICO</i>

90
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,180
<i>It was the Heisei Period.</i>

91
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,600
<i>The setting was a castle town,</i>

92
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,950
<i>where the old warrior spirit...</i>

93
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,340
<i>of the past still lingers.</i>

94
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,760

"Harold Lloyd" glasses...</i>

<i>is the hero of this story,
Ryutaro Tsukue.</i>

98
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
<i>A pure

6th grader</i>

99

<i>Following the recent death
of his father,</i>

100
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,680

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,400
"I hope you'll find me a worthy friend."

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,670

one is suddenly thrown into...</i>

<i>certain group dynamics.</i>

124
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,650
<i>Will this be a happy junction for
Ryutaro or not?</i>

125
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:30,590

an arcade...</i>

214
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,050
"What do you have the sword for?"

215
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,610

no questions...</i>

222
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,530

Ryutaro.</i>

234
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,190
<i>The outcome was too tragic
for him to bear.</i>

235
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,290
<i>I'll never draw my sword.</i>

236
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,300

00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:15,560
"Father, mother...
I appreciate your guidance."

361
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,310
"Come on, Ryutaro!"

362
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,150
<i>Kids fight and make friends again.</i>

363
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,950
<i>That's the way of the children's world.</i>

364
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,470
<i>Be humane, righteous and respectful.</i>

365
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,790
<i>This concludes one episode of
KODOMO-ZAMURAI.</i>

366
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,000
<i>The End</i>

367
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,270
<i>Six centuries ago...</i>

368
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:04,050
<i>a brilliant sword smith made
a sword.</i>

369
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,440
<i>Though praised during times
of civic upheaval,</i>

370
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,890
<i>the sword had absorbed so
much blood...</i>

371
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,160
<i>that it earned the name
"Evil Blade".</i>

372
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,410
<i>The sword smith’s descendant
resented the name.</i>

373
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:27,880
<i>Risking his life,
he forged a dagger of the same steel.</i>

374
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,070
<i>Once stuck in a rock,
the power was nullified.</i>

375
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,410
<i>But now, with the arrival of steel
weapons called guns,</i>

376
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,990
<i>the Evil Blade was about to awaken
from a long sleep...</i>

377
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:55,410

385
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,460
What's going on up there?

386
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,190
I don't know, but...

387
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:06,390
the place is notorious for unsolved
mass murders.

388
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,340
Departed camp at 1400 hours.

389
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:19,230
How many SAT guys are down?

390
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,760
15 killed.

391
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,360
That leaves one survivor.

392
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,800
But we don't know where he is.

393
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:40,180
<i>For all we know,
he could be amongst the dead.</i>

394
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:46,900
They train with loaded weapons -
didn't they fight back?

395
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,930
Looks like they wasted their ammo.

396
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,390
Didn't even hit the target?

397
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,500
No ID on the killer's weapon.

398
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,640
I can't even begin to imagine how
the men died.

399
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,230
The only thing we know is...

400
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,380
that it was all over in a split second.

401
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,280
Stay alert.

402
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,020
There's no predicting what might
happen up there.

403
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,580
<i>I know he's right up there...</i>

404
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:16,290
<i>I have no choice but to have a
showdown with him.</i>

405
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,590
I felt the dagger's presence,
so I returned.

406
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,970
So the dagger possessed you!

407
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,060
You survived the carnage, but...

408
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,590
your luck is about to run out.

409
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,530
I agree with you on that.

410
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,390
You know that weapon is useless
against me.

411
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,910
If the dagger doesn't reveal
itself to me,

412
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,070
I'll slice you into pieces with it.

413
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,330
Turn your back on me and you'll
die sooner.

414
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,930
You're absorbing the power of gunpowder
and bullets!

415
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,570
Do you think your new powers will
make you my equal?

416
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,770
Your equal?

417
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,300
You still don't know which of
us is better.

418
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,370
The power of your blade deludes you.

419
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,220
That little dagger of yours...!

420
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,750
I'll bury you back in that mound,

421
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:38,200
and you'll stay there until you rust and rot.

422
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,580
Keep talking!

423
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,530
People have come to help you.

424
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,900
They're Special Forces.

425
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,590
Are they better than the men...

426
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,440
I killed earlier?

427
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:47,230
You're an idiot who gets high
on carnage.

428
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,930
You too are an abominable creature
of steel!

429
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,670
You'll never escape the pleasure
you get from killing.

430
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,410
I'll satisfy my hunger...

431
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,630
by slicing you into pieces!

432
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,320
I can see you well,
you imperfect thing!

433
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,760
Are you waiting for me to
destroy you?

434
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,000
You lose!
