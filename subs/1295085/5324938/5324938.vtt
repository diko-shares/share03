Okay. Soon as I'm done.

17
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.222
They were born by cesarean
three months ago,

and, against all odds,
they're still alive.

Their physician
from West Germany
called me this morning.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:49.169
Occipital craniopagus twins
have never both
survived a separation.

I wanted to kill myself
when I learned the truth,

36
00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:27.000

I would be killing
two other beings, too.

37

as soon as I saw them,
my heart melted.

Please don't ask us
to choose between them.

39
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:45.386
Well, they don't appear
to be sharing any organs,
which is good.

parts of the brain,
such as the vision center,

It's the reason why
cranial separations
have never succeeded.

You see,
babies have
very little blood,

49
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:17.885
and unless I can
figure out a way to
keep them from bleeding out,

how to stop it, Daddy.

come up to his uncle's farm
this weekend.

gonna get there?

181

Joe's got a license.
We could drive.

182
00:13:17.998 --> 00:13:21.268
The last time he took a trip,
he wrecked his dad's car.

183
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.170

on wrecking this time?

Joe Phillips

I'll be careful.

if he's driving?

do anything.

let you do this.

All right.

202
00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:51.324
I'm reminded of the story
of the missionary doctor
and his wife

203
00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:55.662
who were surprised
by bandits.

204
00:14:55.695 --> 00:15:00.800
You see, these thieves
were terrible men.

205
00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:07.474
Bloodthirsty. Vicious.
They not only
robbed their victims,

206
00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:12.412
they slit their throats
and laughed
as they watched them die.

207
00:15:12.445 --> 00:15:13.981
You all don't hear me.

208
00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:17.951
This poor doctor and his wife
ran for their lives

209
00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:21.654
as the thieves chased them
across rocky, barren land.

210
00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:25.292
These missionaries' feet
were cut open by sharp stones.

211
00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.594
Their clothes were
torn by brambles,

212
00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:32.065
and, finally,
they came upon
a great fortress,

213
00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:34.968
but the Bandit King
was right behind them.

214
00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:41.241
The doctor ran up to
the front door of the fortress
and tried to open it.

215
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.110
But it was locked.

216
00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:48.715
If only someone would
let them in.
No one was there.

217
00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:50.583
And the doctor
and his wife hid,

218
00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:54.621
but the Bandit King saw them
and drew his sword.

219
00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:58.658

nothing that could
save God's good people.

he was my ticket
out of there.

We were happy.

00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:42.662

my life fell apart.

needed their daddy

I found out
he was dealing drugs,

262
00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:37.016
so me and the boys
moved to Boston.

Why'd you come back

Obsidian. That's right.

Do you know
how it was made?

448
00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:50.322
Well, it was formed
after a volcanic eruption,

449
00:29:50.356 --> 00:29:53.592
by the supercooling
of the lava
when it hits the water.

450
00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:58.097
The volcano erupts,
and the lava flows
down red hot.

451
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.334
So, when it hits the water,
the elements coalesce,

452
00:30:02.368 --> 00:30:06.105
and since that water is cold,
the air is forced out,

453
00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:10.943
and the surface glazes over,
and the lava becomes hard,

454
00:30:10.977 --> 00:30:16.215
and that makes obsidine.
I mean obsidian, sorry.

We don't know why,

has a remarkable ability
to recover.

864
00:59:51.889 --> 00:59:55.793

haven't decided what they want
to be when they grow up.

865

of the diseased cells

and then eventually
restore the

Hello, again, Peter, Augusta.
Welcome to Johns Hopkins.

1045
01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:18.735
Your sons' blood vessels
are like tiny faucets

1046
01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:21.570

to lose.

we can keep your sons
from bleeding.

reconstructing
all the blood vessels

1059
01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.804

their hearts start again,

any life-threatening
