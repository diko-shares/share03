1
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.360
Are you still here?

2
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.870
You need to get going.

3
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070
I can't get going.
I told you I don't feel well.

4
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.470
What's the matter now?

5
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.240
Nothing, I just had

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.870
explosive fucking diarrhea
all night

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.440
because you decided
to get us KFC for dinner.

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.650
You have KFC all the time.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.080
Yeah, and I have
diarrhea all the time!

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.650
You're not staying home all day
and playing Baldur's Gate 3.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.190
Now let's go.

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720
Have a good day at school,
sweetie.

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.340
Fuck you, Mom!

14
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.400
This is bullshit.

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.630
How do you get your mom arrested
for child abuse?

16
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.030
She wouldn't let you stay home
and play Baldur's Gate 3,

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.240
fat ass?

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.470
Who you callin' fat,
you heathen bitch?

19
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.610
Dude, you don't wanna
miss school today.

20
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.810
Clyde said he's gonna fart
on Tammy Mullins during P.E.

21
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.080
Tammy Mullins has
sweet fucking knockers.

22
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.750
Dude, Kenny,
enough about Tammy's knockers!

23
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.390
You sound like
a white male trying to

24
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.950
re-establish the patriarchy.

25
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.490
Eric, it's okay.

26
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.920
- It's okay.
- Mom! Mom!

27
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.330
I had a dream that...

28
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.330
I was replaced
by a diverse woman!

29
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.760
Not again.

30
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.100
Yeah, only this time,
it wasn't just me.

31
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.670
They were taking all my favorite
people and replacing them

32
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.676
with diverse women complaining
about the patriarchy.

33
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.340
Will you check
under the bed and make sure

34
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.140
there's no Disney executives
under there?

35
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.610
- I promise there's not.
- I'm scared, Mom!

36
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.686
Will you please just look
and make sure Kathleen Kennedy

37
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.000
isn't under my bed?

38
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.520
Kathleen Kennedy
is not under your bed.

39
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.880
Can you check the closet?

40
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.450
Eric, enough.

41
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.520
I've told you there's no such
thing as Disney executives

42
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.600
who replace everyone you love
with diverse women

43
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.360
who complain
about the patriarchy.

44
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.840
Now be a big boy.

45
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.530
It's-it's not real.

46
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.770
It's... it's not real.

47
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.580
Get up!

48
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.420
Come on, Stan, get up.
Let's go.

49
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.620
- What, Dad?
- Downstairs.

50
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.610
Let's go.
I'm sick of this shit.

51
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.790
Okay.

52
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.660
It has come to my attention
lately that

53
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.600
young people today
don't know how to do shit.

54
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.570
You got your phones and your AI
and you kids haven't

55
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.870
learned to be able
to actually do anything.

56
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.640
So we're going
to take this morning to

57
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.940
learn how to fix something.
You see this?

58
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.080
See this?
The oven door isn't working.

59
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.750
It's falling off the hinges.
So what do we do?

60
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.070
Shelley?

61
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.420
I don't know.

62
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.690
It's very simple.

63
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.390
You gotta
make the hinges tighter

64
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.960
so the oven door's more secure.

65
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.360
So what you do is...
you take out your phone

66
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.030
and you call the handyman.

67
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.220
Hello?

68
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.830
Hello. It's Randy Marsh.

69
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.610
My oven door is not working.
Please come fix it.

70
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.820
Now we rest
until the handyman comes.

71
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.620
Are you following this
at all, guys?

72
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.450
- Is this seeping in?
- Nope.

73
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.320
No, it looks like
the screws are totally stripped.

74
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.840
What does that mean?
What's wrong?

75
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.690
Can't get 'er fixed right now,
I gotta get

76
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.960
some different washers
at the Home Depot.

77
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.400
Okay, do that.

78
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.836
Can't do it right now,
I gotta get

79
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.470
over to Stephen Stotch's house

80
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.030
and install his closet shelves.

81
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.140
Okay, see, kids,
this happens sometimes

82
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.780
but handymen don't make a lot
of money, so here's what you do.

83
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.210
Okay, I will pay you
an extra 30 bucks

84
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.940
if you fix my oven now.

85
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.350
Yeah, sorry, but Stotch already
gave me an extra 50 bucks.

86
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.020
I will pay you
an extra 55 bucks.

87
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.290
Randy, did you fix
the oven door yet?

88
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.260
I'm working on it!

89
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.590
Look, please.

90
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.366
Whatever you want.
I'll throw in a six-pack

91
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.730
of beer and you can get drunk.

92
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.966
I don't need your trivial
little perks anymore, Marsh.

93
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.830
I got work comin'
out my ears. It's like...

94
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.530
I don't know,
it's like nobody knows

95
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.580
how to do shit anymore.

96
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.300
You're...
You're just gonna leave?

97
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.470
I'll pay a different handyman.

98
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.770
Yeah, go for it, buddy,

99
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.290
I got so much money
I don't care.

100
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.060
What the hell is going on?

101
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.350
All right, just try to relax.
Take a deep breath.

102
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.760
Now tell me exactly
what it is you're afraid of.

103
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.760
I keep having the same dream.

104
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.860
Everywhere I look,
people are being replaced.

105
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.500
Okay. And who do you think
is going to have you replaced?

106
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.900
Them. The puppet masters.

107
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.470
The last time I had the dream,
I was, I was walking

108
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.170
down the school hallway...

109
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.040
And then I see Butters,
and he's like...

110
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.456
Hey, Eric! You wanna see

111
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.760
what my mom packed me for lunch?

112
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.150
And that's when
I start to notice

113
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.756
that something's wrong.
Everyone I cared about

114
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.080
has been
systematically replaced.

115
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.896
And finally I want to scream
and I'm like...

116
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.680
Why are they replacing
every single character

117
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.250
with someone who is diverse?

118
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.936
- But then Kenny's like...
- It's not

119
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.436
our fault, it's 'cause of
Kathleen Kennedy.

120
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.736
But then Kathleen Kennedy's
just like...

121
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.960
Fuck it! Make it more lame.

122
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.930
And everyone in town is like,

123
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.976
"No, please, Kathleen Kennedy,
stop ruining everything."

124
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.276
But Kathleen Kennedy
is all like...

125
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.700
Put another gay diverse
woman in it.

126
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.440
Make it more fucking lame.

127
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.746
And Disney stock just keeps
going down and down and down!

128
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.240
And then Bob Iger is all like...

129
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.686
No! No!
What's going on with my stocks?

130
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.980
No, Kathleen Kennedy!

131
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.380
It happened again, didn't it?

132
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.620
Okay, Eric, I think I know
what's going on here.

133
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.290
Your fears aren't about Disney
replacing everything you love.

134
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.890
What everyone is afraid of these
days is being replaced by AI.

135
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.430
- AI?
- But you don't need

136
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.030
to worry, Eric.

137
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.530
As long as you work hard
and stay in school,

138
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.170
you can make something
of yourself.

139
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.270
Become an elite worker like
I did that AI can't replace.

140
00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.910
You're a therapist
and the best thing

141
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.346
you have to tell me is
"stay in school"?

142
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.910
You're in control
of your future, Eric.

143
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.810
You just need to ask yourself,

144
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.180
"Who will be the people

145
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.130
still making money
in the AI-driven future?"

146
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.670
What the... What the fuck?

147
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.490
Could you hurry it up, please?

148
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.906
I kind of need to
get back to work.

149
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.030
Yep, well, looks like

150
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.800
you got a short
in the outlet there.

151
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.576
I'd have to get a new outlet
at Home Depot.

152
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.370
I can probably come
change it on the 28th.

153
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.340
28th? No, no, no, look.

154
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.640
I'll give a hundred bucks
to get this done today.

155
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.940
I already got a feller
giving me thousands

156
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.880
to fix his toilet
this afternoon.

157
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.450
Thousands?
I can't afford that.

158
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.950
Free therapy sessions.

159
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.320
How about we trade?
You do the handiwork for me.

160
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.650
And I'll give you five
free therapy sessions!

161
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.190
No, thanks.

162
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.910
I do all my therapy
on the AI Freudbot app.

163
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.070
This is
South Park Breaking News.

164
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.230
Shocking developments
in the country today,

165
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.300
it appears that nobody
knows how to do shit anymore.

166
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.010
Our own Chris Martins
is live on the scene.

167
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.680
Tom, I'm standing in
my bathroom where the new

168
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.380
tile for my shower
has yet to be installed.

169
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.480
As you can see, the tile has
started to peel off in places.

170
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.050
Now the handyman was supposed
to come days ago to fix it

171
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.610
but he claims to have
better offers

172
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.090
from other white-collar workers

173
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.360
like me whose practical
know-how has atrophied.

174
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.560
It appears
we've all screwed ourselves

175
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.910
by relying on technology and AI.

176
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.840
Hey, Siri,

177
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.570
how do you fix
a broken oven door?

178
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.610
Here's what I found
from reference.com.

179
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.880
Undo any screws that
hold the hinges in position,

180
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.010
pull the door upward
and then outwards

181
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.080
to detach hinges from the oven.

182
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.120
Insert the new hinge
into the hinge holes

183
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.990
and secure the hinges
with screws.

184
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.330
Hey, Siri, okay,
can you do that for me?

185
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.130
Can I do what for you?

186
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.430
Can you fix my oven door for me?

187
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.160
It's broken.

188
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.970
I cannot do that
because I do not have arms.

189
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.100
You will need
to call a handyman.

190
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.540
The handyman isn't available.

191
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.210
He's all, like, rich now

192
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.140
and I fucking rely on him to
keep everything working here!

193
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.910
I am unable to fix an oven door.

194
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.420
Well, hey, Siri,
I thought AI was supposed to be

195
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.120
this amazing scary advancement
that could, like, do anything.

196
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.020
Hey, Randy,
the oven door in the kitchen

197
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.010
- still isn't...
- I am working on it!

198
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.390
Hey, Siri,
all the handymen are rich

199
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.900
and I can't afford them anymore
so what do I do?

200
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.400
Perhaps you could find
an unlicensed worker

201
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.340
who does small day jobs
for cash.

202
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.840
You mean like those
broke-ass illegal immigrants

203
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.810
down at Home Depot?

204
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.880
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said it that way.

205
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.050
Hey, Siri, you mean like those

206
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.650
broke-ass illegal immigrants
down at Home Depot?

207
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.590
Yes. There are often
people sitting out front

208
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.660
of Home Depot
waiting to be hired for work.

209
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.310
Yeah. Those guys!

210
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.930
Hey, Kenny, can we talk to you?

211
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.400
Sure, guys, what's up?

212
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.530
Well, Clyde says that you
told Tammy Mullins

213
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.000
he was gonna fart on her in P.E.
so she didn't show up.

214
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.040
Yeah, I might have told her.

215
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.886
Well, Kenny, everyone was really
looking forward to that.

216
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.040
Why did you ruin it?

217
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.680
I told you guys
I think Tammy Mullins

218
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.510
- has sweet fucking knockers.
- You guys!

219
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.680
You guys! Something super crazy
is happening, you guys.

220
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.080
You went on a diet?

221
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.720
This is serious, Kyle!

222
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.220
At first they were just dreams,

223
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.460
but now I feel like
I'm actually changing.

224
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.160
Why would I be having visions
that I'm a diverse woman?

225
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.160
Because you're a fat,
racist piece of shit.

226
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.560
Goddamn it, I'm not fat.
I'm just shamed for my body

227
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.506
in a world where white men
decide what's beautiful.

228
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.700
What the fuck was that?!

229
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.770
Why would I say that?
I don't say that. You see?!

230
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.170
This is happening
to all of us, you guys.

231
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.940
You might think
everything is okay.

232
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.710
But Disney... is gonna get ya.

233
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.480
Kathleen Kennedy's gonna get ya.

234
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.320
Disney and Kathleen Kennedy
are gonna get ya!

235
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.790
I don't think that what
I'm experiencing are dreams.

236
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.760
I think that what
I'm seeing are windows...

237
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.920
into alternate universes.

238
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.540
Yeah, okay, I'm out.

239
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.550
It's true, Kyle, there could be

240
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.290
other universes
with other versions of...

241
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.206
Everyone's sick of
the stupid multiverse, Cartman.

242
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.100
It's not stupid,
it's totally possible

243
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.700
and if you can't...

244
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.300
Kyle? Kyle?

245
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.516
I swear, the multiverse is
just an excuse for lazy writing.

246
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.580
- Whoa. Kyle!
- Yeah, it's like
every damn movie now.

247
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.710
Kyle, what is this?

248
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.810
You might
wanna listen to him, Kyle!

249
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.580
Kyle, you gotta help me!

250
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.780
Help me, Kyle!

251
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.030
Hey!

252
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.430
Hey, I need a worker!

253
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.430
- Is that a handyman?
- There's one!

254
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.116
Hey, you wanna trade?

255
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.300
What the fuck?

256
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.270
Randy! You know how
to do stuff, right?

257
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.590
I gotta get the radiant heat

258
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.216
installed in my house
and I'm offering

259
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.880
free legal advice in exchange.

260
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.480
You need a reporter?

261
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.920
I'll report the news to you
if you fix my shower tile!

262
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.280
How about a computer programmer?
I can do coding!

263
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.020
Insurance broker?
Insurance broker?

264
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.700
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

265
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.990
We're trying to get
a handyman to do stuff for us.

266
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.130
You know how to
install radiant heat or not?

267
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.760
No, I need some broke-ass
immigrants to fix my oven door.

268
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.230
Dang it.

269
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.580
Hey! Here comes
a different handyman!

270
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.670
Hey, anyone wanna
make a bunch of money?

271
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.790
I need four workers who know
how to use a power saw.

272
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.380
I'll do lawyer work if
you install my radiant heat!

273
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.210
I've got skills
in human resources.

274
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.610
Let's work something out!

275
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.230
No, I need guys that know
how to work a power saw.

276
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.610
None of you know how to
work a power saw? Jesus Christ.

277
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.540
What universe is this?

278
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.210
Yo, Kenny, we gotta
ask you something.

279
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.080
Are you, like,
in love with Tammy Mullins?

280
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.680
I'm not in love with her,
I just like her knockers.

281
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.150
Okay, well, why would you
protect someone from getting

282
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.850
farted on unless there
were some real feelings there?

283
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.050
Dude, I said I was sorry, okay?

284
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.590
You guys! You guys!

285
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.620
Something really weird
is going on!

286
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.490
I keep having the same dream
that I'm a fat little white boy.

287
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.230
You ain't white,
but you definitely fat.

288
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.800
This is serious, Kyle!

289
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.040
It's more than a dream,
it's becoming like real now!

290
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.540
I keep seeing all of you!

291
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.610
Being replaced by
little white motherfuckers!

292
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.280
Well, maybe you should try
not being so racist, Cartman.

293
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.510
You can't be racist
towards white people, Stan!

294
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.750
They all honky-ass bitches!
You know what this is?

295
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.800
I think this is some
alternate universe shit.

296
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.630
Yeah, right, you just
acting crazy 'cause you wanna

297
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.420
- get sent home from school.
- No, I'm not, Kyle!

298
00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.220
Yeah, bitch, you just
wanna get sent home

299
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.430
so you can play Baldur's Gate 3.

300
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.640
What the fuck?

301
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.540
My God, it's all real!

302
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.610
Whatever you're doing,
Cartman, we ain't buyin' it.

303
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.440
Stay away from me! You aren't
my friends! Do you understand?

304
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.910
Is that supposed to be Cartman?

305
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.620
It ain't Cartman
but it's still fat.

306
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.480
Just more like
little round and fat.

307
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.520
Yeah, like Tammy Mullins'
knockers.

308
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.820
Kenny! Brah.

309
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.990
Chill with the knockers. Man!

310
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.330
No...

311
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.740
No...!

312
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.500
Okay, so Clyde says he
can probably try to fart

313
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.420
on Tammy Mullins again
during fourth period.

314
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.310
But this time Kenny
has to keep his mouth shut.

315
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.410
It's fine!
I won't say anything, fine!

316
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.746
He's gonna say something,
he's totally in love with her.

317
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.640
- No, I'm not!
- You guys! You guys!

318
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.810
Holy shit, you guys,
I fuckin' told you!

319
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.600
I fuckin' told you this
was happening, didn't I?

320
00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.650
Told us what was happening?

321
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.410
I told you I was having
all these dreams

322
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.890
that I was a fat
little white boy

323
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.036
and you guys were all
white boys too and now look!

324
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.640
Y'all actually turned into 'em!

325
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.690
- Do we know you?
- I'm Cartman.

326
00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.600
And you're Kyle and you're Stan
and you're fucking Kenny.

327
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.430
Only it's a parallel,
alternated universe

328
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.870
and y'all have been replaced.

329
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.000
Okay, cool lady.

330
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.770
We gotta get to class.

331
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.410
No! No, no, no, no, no!

332
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.250
You guys are gonna
listen to me this time!

333
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.110
I need help!

334
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.050
Cartman's just messing with us.

335
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.280
Fuck you, Kyle!

336
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.996
This is serious,
you fuckin' butt-fucker!

337
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.680
Yeah, listen, lady,
we really gotta get going.

338
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.890
Will you guys fucking
listen to me?! I'm Cartman!

339
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.920
You're not Cartman and
multiple universes are stupid.

340
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.480
Goddamn it!

341
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.660
Tom, I'm still here
live at the scene.

342
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.370
Dozens of white-collar workers
are gathered hoping

343
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.170
to get the attention of
just one handyman.

344
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.740
It's a scene
of desperation and a reminder

345
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.660
of where our
country's economy is headed.

346
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.660
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

347
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.450
Hey, hey! Excuse me,
you're a handyman, right?

348
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.990
Can I get you to come look
at my oven door?

349
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.620
I can trade you services.

350
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.030
I have geology skills.
Could you come fix my door

351
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.760
and I'll give you some geology?

352
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.860
Hey, why don't you guys
get outta here?

353
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.220
You're making the Home Depot
look all shitty.

354
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.040
Fuckin' rich assholes.

355
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.740
Sucks.

356
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.940
Aw, man.

357
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.340
Boy, I wish
I knew how to fix stuff.

358
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.540
I'd be rich, too.

359
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.810
I could know how to fix stuff!

360
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.810
The problem is
when I could have been learning

361
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.090
how to fix stuff, I went
to fucking college instead!

362
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.520
Hey, yeah, he's right.

363
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.220
We all went to college,
and where did it get us?

364
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.620
Yeah, I'm still paying off
my college loans.

365
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.630
Yeah, so am I! Now I don't
know how to do anything

366
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.400
'cause I got suckered into going
to college and learning stupid

367
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.470
geology that anyone can know
'cause of goddamn AI!

368
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.770
Yeah, fuck college!

369
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.440
Let's go
get our fucking money back!

370
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.740
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Fuck college!

371
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.760
Come on, let's go!

372
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.750
- Stupid college!
- You wasted our time!

373
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.980
- Fuck you, college!
- Piece of shit college!

374
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.490
Hey-hey, college!

375
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.920
You know what you are?!
You're a scam!

376
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.190
College is a scam!

377
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.190
Yeah!

378
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.460
Yeah, that's right!

379
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.660
Yeah, hey, college!

380
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.230
Here's my student loan bill.

381
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.160
That I'm still paying off!

382
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.680
Well, guess what,
I'm not paying it!

383
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.500
- Yeah!
- We don't owe you nothing!

384
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.546
Guess what, college?!

385
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.840
We don't owe you money,
you owe us money!

386
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.140
Yeah!

387
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.260
Yeah, that's right!

388
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.080
You think you can
just sit there and not even

389
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.750
respond to us, college?
Okay!

390
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.490
You aren't going to destroy
any more lives!

391
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.220
All right, bring in
the catapult.

392
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.860
Bring in the catapult!

393
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.060
Yeah!

394
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.290
Yeah, that's right!

395
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.850
- What's that?
- That's the catapult.

396
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.740
Well, but it's still in the box.

397
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.240
Yeah, somebody's
gotta put it together.

398
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.110
Well, how are we gonna...

399
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.510
Hang on, college!

400
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.986
How're we gonna
break the college if

401
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.450
the catapult is still
in the box?

402
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.080
It's okay,
we called the handyman.

403
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.330
He's gonna build it for us.

404
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.990
Hello, gentlemen, what
seems to be the problem?

405
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.460
You said
you couldn't work today.

406
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.400
You're supposed
to fix my oven door!

407
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.170
I've got a lot of jobs there,
buddy.

408
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.570
This one paid the most today.

409
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.100
We all pooled together
and offered him $20,000.

410
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.770
$20,000?

411
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.440
What the fuck
are you guys doing?!

412
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.990
You're gonna make him
totally impossible now!

413
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.650
All right, send Broflovski,
Marsh and McKormick

414
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.830
into my office, please.

415
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.120
Aw, what the hell?

416
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.826
Sit down, boys.
One of our students here

417
00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.326
says you've been
treating them unfairly.

418
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.160
- Treating who unfairly?
- We didn't do anything!

419
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.790
We're just minding
our own business

420
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.610
and she keeps saying
she's Eric Cartman!

421
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.750
Okay. And what's
wrong with that?

422
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.800
What's wrong is it
doesn't make any sense.

423
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.400
Okay, I see.

424
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.246
There's a diverse female
where Cartman used to be

425
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.370
and you don't like that.

426
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.470
It's not that we
don't like it, it's...

427
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:17.830
don't you think that's weird?

428
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.580
I don't see
a problem with it at all.

429
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.556
And if you boys don't think
Eric can be a Black woman,

430
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.600
then maybe the problem is you.

431
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.870
What?

432
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.190
You think it's perfectly normal

433
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.790
that Cartman
is suddenly a Black woman?

434
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.396
You probably don't like
that Indiana Jones got replaced

435
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.860
by a female either?

436
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.206
You probably have a problem
with Black Spider-Man, too.

437
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.730
No! Miles Morales is sweet.

438
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.206
That's a whole constructed thing

439
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.670
with its own character
and narrative!

440
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.730
This is just taking Cartman,
same old Cartman,

441
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.640
and putting a Black woman in it.

442
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.770
Well, you know what I think
about that, Kyle?

443
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.040
Hold on. Hold on.

444
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.316
That's what I think
about that, Kyle!

445
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.480
Goddamn it, Cartman!

446
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.180
Dude, what the fuck
is going on?!

447
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.910
I'll tell you what's going on.

448
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.956
You boys feel that your white
culture is being threatened

449
00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.580
and so you're
lashing out with racism.

450
00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.450
And if you
say anything more about

451
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.326
a Black woman Cartman
not making any sense,

452
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.310
then you can all just have
three weeks' detention!

453
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.590
Now get out of my office!

454
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.360
Goddamn it!

455
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.230
Fuck you, Kyle.
You have to help me!

456
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.300
How's that fart feeling
on your face right now?

457
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.660
Shut up!

458
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.850
Na-na-na-na-na.
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

459
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.880
And we both told Clyde,
"Okay, you can try to fart

460
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.880
on Tammy Mullins later.
Kenny won't tell her."

461
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.680
And guess what? This little
motherfucker does it again!

462
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.120
I'm sorry.
She hypnotized me.

463
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.996
Everyone's trying
to enjoy themselves, dude.

464
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.860
Why do you keep fucking it up?

465
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.660
Hey, who's the fat
little white boy?

466
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.760
Who knows?
White heterosexual males

467
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.460
think they're welcome anywhere.

468
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.070
Okay, children,
let's take our seats.

469
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.140
Today we're going to
talk more about female exclusion

470
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.710
in the male patriarchy.

471
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.610
Butters,
who is that sitting next to you?

472
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:00.850
I don't know, ma'am.

473
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.050
I think it's
supposed to be Eric.

474
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.650
I am Eric!

475
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.880
All Cartman cares about
is playing Baldur's Gate 3.

476
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.090
So the bitch did a switcheroo
with Spanky here.

477
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.720
That is not what's going on!

478
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.080
And I am not going to sit here
and be insulted anymore!

479
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.730
I am a respected citizen
in my universe

480
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.060
and I demand to speak to
someone with authority!

481
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.720
Is there a problem here?

482
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.820
No!

483
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.010
Eight years.

484
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.010
Eight years I spent
wasting time at stupid college

485
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.090
when I could have been
learning how to do stuff.

486
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.480
All the time we spent
memorizing, studying... for what?

487
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.920
Anyone gets any info they want
with the touch of a button now.

488
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.520
All right,
I think she's ready to go.

489
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.630
It's ready! It's ready!

490
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.560
Okay, okay, aim it
at the center of the school.

491
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.060
How do we fire it?

492
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.180
There's a big red button here.
Should I press it?

493
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.050
Yeah, yeah, let 'er rip!

494
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.810
Yeah! Yeah!

495
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.380
Yeah, take that, college!

496
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.110
Let's see them ignore that!

497
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.480
I can't wait
to see what they do now.

498
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.590
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

499
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.200
Hey-hey, wait, what's that?

500
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.240
Hey! Hey, no,
you son of a bitch!

501
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.130
He's just gonna fix the glass!

502
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.106
You fucking give these
billionaires your money

503
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.646
and then another billionaire
just comes

504
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.240
and profits off of that.

505
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.690
Society is so fucked up!

506
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.780
Something is
wrong with the universe.

507
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.620
Our stocks are down
and every Disney movie

508
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.250
this year has failed!

509
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.890
We don't understand it, sir.

510
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.160
We keep making
the same movie over and over

511
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.290
and pandering to everyone
but suddenly it's not working.

512
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.730
Then we've got to pander harder!

513
00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.100
Look, I don't want
to have to say it, but...

514
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.150
I think the problem is
Kathleen Kennedy.

515
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.310
Kathleen Kennedy has
made studios a lot of money.

516
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.910
Yes, before. But you have
to admit something's changed.

517
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.480
For weeks now she's been
completely different.

518
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.980
- It's true.
- What if...

519
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.970
this is a different
Kathleen Kennedy?

520
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.750
What are you saying, Rick?

521
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.760
I'm just saying
isn't it possible

522
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.420
that we here
at Disney pandered so much...

523
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.980
that we've opened a doorway
to the panderverse.

524
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.430
The panderverse
is just a theory!

525
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.530
And yet we do have
the panderstone downstairs.

526
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.970
It's possible that someone
has tampered with it somehow.

527
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.870
Well, she's on her way in
right now.

528
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.040
If you wanna tell
Kathleen Kennedy you think

529
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.710
she's from
an alternate universe,

530
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.750
because we misused
the panderstone, go right ahead!

531
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.670
Is there a problem, people?

532
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.930
No problem at all, Mrs. Kennedy.

533
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.860
We were just discussing ideas

534
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.820
of what to do with
the new Prince Eric movie.

535
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.900
Put a chick in it, make her gay!

536
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.400
Yes, Mrs. Kennedy,
some of the execs are just

537
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.110
- expressing that maybe...
- Well, that maybe we should go

538
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.580
a different route than we did
with Indiana Jones.

539
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.940
Fuck Indiana Jones!

540
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.200
Put a chick in it
and make her lame and gay!

541
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.250
Sure. Yeah.

542
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.200
Let's try that... again.

543
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.860
And then... and then there was,
like, this ball

544
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.430
and then Eric floated up

545
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.060
into this portal
and disappeared!

546
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.700
I don't care
what you saw, Butters,

547
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.106
there's gotta be
a better explanation

548
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.840
than just the stupid multiverse.

549
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.540
Some multiverse stuff is cool.

550
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.380
Yeah, it can be cool for,
like, one movie.

551
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.116
Now it's just this
cheap device that people use

552
00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.980
to breathe life
into tired franchises.

553
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.200
What are you guys talking about?

554
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.120
We were just talking about
how amazing this all is.

555
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.750
Okay, I've been trying to think

556
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.270
about what we should do,
you guys.

557
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.066
I think I know
how to make everything right,

558
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.796
but we're gonna need
a really powerful computer.

559
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.236
Are you gonna eat
your brownie, Kenny?

560
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.590
Yeah, I'm gonna eat my brownie!

561
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.750
Okay, fine, so we'll take you
to the computer lab.

562
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.960
No, no, no, no, for this,

563
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.640
we gotta get
a really powerful system.

564
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.070
Is Kyle's mom still a big
fat bitch in this universe?

565
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.170
What? My mom's not a bitch.

566
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.400
Well, I mean,
she is kind of bitchy.

567
00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.940
She's a big dumb bitch?

568
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.216
What does calling my mom a bitch
have to do with anything?

569
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.340
Because we could fake
a letter from Kyle's mom

570
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.580
giving Kyle permission
to use her credit card number

571
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.880
to buy all the stuff
we need at Best Buy.

572
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.850
I mean, PC Principal
did say we have to help him.

573
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.020
Her. Them. It.

574
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.960
That's the dumbest idea ever!

575
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.260
I don't even know what
my mom's credit number is!

576
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.690
8-7-1-5...

577
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:42.960
3-2-7...

578
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.760
4-9-2...

579
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.260
2-1-0-0-7.

580
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.850
I use it all the time.

581
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.960
All right. Full name?

582
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.080
What is your name, sir?

583
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.120
I told them already
my name is Eric Cartman.

584
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.320
We know Eric Cartman, okay?

585
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.120
Eric Cartman is in here
all the time getting in trouble.

586
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.080
That's because I'm
from a different universe!

587
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.636
How many times do I have
to tell you people?

588
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.236
The Disney company tried to
use their platform

589
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.760
to bring about social change
and I got fucked.

590
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.800
Hey, Chief. Chief,
you gotta hear this one.

591
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.630
What is it, Johnston?

592
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.070
Aw, God.

593
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.040
This little white boy
claims he's actually

594
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.510
from a different universe.

595
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.940
Is that so?

596
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.486
All right, honkey,
what kind of narcotics

597
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.110
are you on?
Did you do a cavity search?

598
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.956
Have you even said what
you've arrested me for?

599
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.261
I come from a place where this
is extremely inappropriate.

600
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.750
- Chief! Hey, Chief!
- Yeah?

601
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.850
There's some
crazy white lady downstairs

602
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.970
freakin' out and saying
she needs to talk to you.

603
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.290
More honkies?

604
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.020
What is this,
a Taylor Swift concert?

605
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.020
Tell the nice lady
I'll see her after I'm done

606
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.800
with "Eric Cartman" here.

607
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.260
Well, that's just it, Chief.

608
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.670
She's sayin' she's
looking for an Eric Cartman.

609
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.630
Says her name
is Kathleen Kennedy.

610
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.600
Kathleen Kennedy?! No!

611
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.646
She's gonna try to change me,
too! I'm the only one left!

612
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.830
- Hey, get back here!
- She's gonna get me!

613
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.650
Tom, I'm standing outside

614
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.980
the South Park Country Club
where protestors have gathered

615
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.450
to point out
the unfairness in our economy.

616
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.490
The White House says they're
doing all they can but it's been

617
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.260
several days now and my bathroom
tile still is not installed.

618
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.530
Yeah, that's right. You see,
the whole system is rigged.

619
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.300
You've got people like us
who just need our stuff fixed,

620
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.500
and meanwhile
there's these billionaires

621
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.800
that have all the control!

622
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.200
Did you know that if just

623
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.986
one of these billionaires
spread their wealth,

624
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.291
it would mean thousands
to every per...

625
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.830
It would mean thousands
to every...

626
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.140
Sorry, hang on, just a second.

627
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.650
Yeah?

628
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.920
Hey, Ran, the oven door still
isn't shutting right.

629
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.880
Yeah, I'm working on it, Sharon!

630
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.150
I'm actually
working on it right now!

631
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.990
Hey, one of them's coming out!

632
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.190
Please, just glance
at my water pressure!

633
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.730
Mr. Fix It, can you please
tell us why you haven't been

634
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.360
responding to people's calls?

635
00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.260
Well, I've just been busy
with my various assets.

636
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.000
You see, I've been trying
to acquire

637
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.840
some social media platforms.
I just bought Instagram.

638
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.170
What? The country needs
stuff fixed.

639
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.010
Why the fuck are you out
buying Instagram?!

640
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.950
Hey, did you just outbid me
to acquire Instagram?

641
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.350
Yeah, I outbid you.

642
00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.050
I own Instagram now
and you don't!

643
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:22.790
Yeah?
Well, I just acquired

644
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.890
the entire
Bloomberg media company!

645
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.520
Yeah?
Well, I can kick your ass.

646
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.190
You wanna fight me MMA?

647
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.290
Yeah, I'll fight you MMA,
let's do it.

648
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.100
What the hell
are they doing now?

649
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.670
I'm just gonna make a company

650
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.270
and I'm gonna fly to space!

651
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.530
I bet I can get to space
before you do!

652
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.120
Gal! Fuck these guys!

653
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.180
She has all the right things
in her purse.

654
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.150
Her driver's license
says Kathleen Kennedy,

655
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.250
she has Kathleen Kennedy
credit cards.

656
00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.950
This is definitely all the same
makeup Mrs. Kennedy uses.

657
00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:58.090
I mean, according to this,
she really is Kathleen Kennedy.

658
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.830
Or Kathleen Kennedy
from another universe.

659
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.590
That's enough! Please!

660
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.930
We're not going to
waste our time chasing

661
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:06.700
after wild scientific theories!

662
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.100
Well, we have to do something.

663
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.070
Kathleen Kennedy is down
on set right now

664
00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.970
ruining the new Bambi movie!

665
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.410
Put a diverse woman in it,
make it lame!

666
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.010
But Mrs. Kennedy,
Bam-Bambi's a baby deer.

667
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.080
Fuck baby deer!
Put a chick in it, make her gay!

668
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.350
You guys, you better
come take a look at this.

669
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.450
I don't think we are dealing
with our Kathleen Kennedy.

670
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.720
I took images of Mrs. Kennedy
and put them

671
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.120
against images of her
from a few months ago.

672
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.760
With AI we could detect
the smallest irregularities.

673
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.580
Take a look.

674
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.600
All right. What do we know
about the panderverse?

675
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.010
I'm afraid we know...

676
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.440
frighteningly little.

677
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.210
The only thing we know for sure

678
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.280
is that if a portal
were somehow opened

679
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.650
with the panderstone,

680
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.420
then both universes
eventually will collide,

681
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.220
leading to a level of pandering
we can't even fathom.

682
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.120
That we know for sure. Yes.

683
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.496
Then we have to get everyone

684
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.260
back to the right universe.

685
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.050
Before it's complete
pandermonium.

686
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.510
Okay, Kenny,
switch on the power supply.

687
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.110
Stan, make sure
we've got ethernet!

688
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.650
- All good.
- All right,

689
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.950
let's just hope this works.

690
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.050
Man, what the hell?

691
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.520
Dude, Kyle, what is up
with your Internet speed?

692
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.760
Go tell your parents to
upgrade your Internet speed.

693
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.020
No!

694
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.666
Kyle, I know
you're afraid of your mom

695
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.760
'cause she's a fat bitch,
but we have to do this.

696
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.260
Stop calling my mom a bitch!

697
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.360
Kyle!

698
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.230
I just got an alert
that someone used

699
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.100
my credit card at Best Buy?!

700
00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.370
Hello, Mrs. Broflovski.

701
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.340
My goodness,
you're looking nice today.

702
00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.940
What?

703
00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.840
You know, credit card fraud

704
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.450
is very serious,
Mrs. Broflovski.

705
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.530
You should call your
Internet company right away

706
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.050
and up your speed
and make sure you're protected.

707
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.090
Really? Kyle, who is this?

708
00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.060
Haven't you heard, Mom?

709
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.920
We're in a multiverse
and this is

710
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.510
supposed to be Eric Cartman.

711
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.690
Okay, I'm fine with that.

712
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.030
I better go call
the Internet company.

713
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.606
What do you mean
you're fine with that?

714
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.100
I think all this stuff
is great, Kyle.

715
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.200
And what "all stuff"
is that, exactly?

716
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.070
Ha! It worked.

717
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.970
She's gonna call
the Internet company.

718
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.540
Your mom is such
a dumb bitch, Kyle!

719
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.980
Shut up, Cartman!

720
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.220
Butters.

721
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.660
Butters! Butters, listen to me.

722
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.260
- It's me, Eric.
- You-You-You're not Eric!

723
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.740
Yes, I am Eric Cartman, Butters.

724
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.300
Kathleen Kennedy
is trying to get me.

725
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.076
She won't stop until her
master plan is complete.

726
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.930
I'm not supposed to have
anyone in my room, I'm grounded!

727
00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.370
Butters, Disney is going to
get me. They already got you!

728
00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.870
They did?!

729
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.370
We are in this together,
Butters.

730
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.970
You have to
keep me safe until I can

731
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.840
figure out how we're gonna...

732
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.980
She's here!
Butters, don't let her get me.

733
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.650
Butters?!

734
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.220
Butters! Why didn't you
answer this door?

735
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.890
Hey, Dad.

736
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.790
What are you doing up here?
And why do you look so scared?

737
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.860
I'm not scared, I'm just,
I'm just having fun.

738
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.260
Well, no having fun.

739
00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.000
You are grounded.
Start being more miserable.

740
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.300
- Dad?
- Yes, Butters?

741
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.140
Could you check
under my bed and make sure

742
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.740
Kathleen Kennedy isn't there?

743
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.270
Butters, what have I told you
about being more mature?

744
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.410
I can assure you
Kathleen Kennedy

745
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.630
is not under your bed!

746
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.196
That's fucking Kathleen Kennedy!

747
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.220
Right fucking there!

748
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.120
You! Come here!

749
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.990
No, no, no, no, no!

750
00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.450
No, no! No, no, no!

751
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.550
Well, Shelley,

752
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.680
we need to talk
about your future.

753
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.850
You see, there's very few
people at the top these days.

754
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.490
AI can do everything
better than we can,

755
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.470
except for stuff
that requires arms.

756
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.230
I don't want you to
end up a deadbeat loser

757
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.930
who goes to college, Shelley.

758
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.660
You need to stay out of school,

759
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.570
and instead go out and be
taught real skills that will

760
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.800
still be profitable
in this post-AI universe.

761
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.910
So what you do is you take
out your phone and you call

762
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.440
the handyman, and see if
those rich people will have

763
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.700
any internships or training
programs available for you.

764
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.390
Handyman service,
how can I help you?

765
00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.090
Yeah, hi, it's Randy Marsh.

766
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.690
I was wondering if you
might have any internships

767
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.100
available for my daughter...

768
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.530
Hey! What in tarnation?!

769
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.300
I told you I'd beat you,
you son' bitch!

770
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.500
You ain't beatin' me!
Turn up them thrusters!

771
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.260
My galactic cruiser's
bigger than yours!

772
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.570
H-Hello?

773
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:16.946
Get out my way,
you little pecker!

774
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.210
Hello? Never mind.

775
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.430
The rich people are all just
fucking around in space.

776
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.020
What the hell was that?

777
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.120
I'm getting significantly strong
readings from the panderstone.

778
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.990
Mr. Iger.
We may have a solution.

779
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.860
If this Kathleen Kennedy here
is from somewhere else, then

780
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.890
there has to be a match for her
somewhere in our universe.

781
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.500
So what we can do

782
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.630
is use an AI program that
can take every image ever put

783
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.820
on the Internet to try
and find a match to our image.

784
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.460
Different, different, different,

785
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.370
different, different,
different, different,

786
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.980
different,
different, different...

787
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.650
Same.

788
00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.810
Eric Cartman.

789
00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.320
South Park Elementary.

790
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.320
Evans, Mallory, come with me.

791
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.650
The rest of you,
don't let Kathleen Kennedy

792
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.020
find out what we're up to.

793
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.620
It's okay, we're keeping
Mrs. Kennedy distracted.

794
00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.440
We've sent her away
to have lunch at Spago.

795
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.130
There you are, Mrs. Kennedy,

796
00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:16.830
the linguini and clam sauce.

797
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.340
Excuse me?

798
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.246
I believe I asked you
to put a chick in this

799
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.870
and make her gay?

800
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.410
Yes, the chef was a little
confused what you meant by that.

801
00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.310
It means put a chick
in the linguini

802
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.860
and make her fucking gay!

803
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.900
And I want it lame!

804
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:43.130
She's gonna get me!
She's gonna get me!

805
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.490
No, no, no, no, no!

806
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.410
Hey, who's that, Ned?

807
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.080
I'm not sure.

808
00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.860
No!

809
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.720
There he is!
Get him!

810
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.540
No. My God, please, no!

811
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.260
No...!

812
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.810
Which way did they go?

813
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.240
We have to work together.

814
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.870
Fuck you, Kathleen Kennedy!
Stay away, you fuckin' bitch!

815
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.460
I'm in the same situation
you are, Eric!

816
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.250
I know you're in
the wrong universe.

817
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.630
So am I.

818
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:49.030
Well, there's no
other way to put it.

819
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.710
They have us over a barrel.

820
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.600
We give these billionaires
all our money, rely on them,

821
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.290
and so they can do
whatever they want.

822
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.740
Let's just face it, we're
never gonna get our stuff fixed.

823
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.410
Yeah.

824
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:08.810
And I guess it's
nobody's fault but our own.

825
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.410
Excuse me?

826
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:11.750
My name is Bob Iger

827
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.430
from the Disney
entertainment company.

828
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.750
We're looking
for an Eric Cartman.

829
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.690
Our universe
has been manipulated with.

830
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.110
Have you all
noticed anything strange?

831
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.960
Yes. Yes, the world
is completely upside down!

832
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.400
Nothing makes sense!

833
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.100
It's because
there's some kind of

834
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.640
disruption in the panderverse.

835
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.370
We believe Kathleen Kennedy
has opened a portal.

836
00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.970
This is all
Kathleen Kennedy's fault?

837
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.440
This is all Kathleen Kennedy's
fault!

838
00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.680
Who's Kathleen Kennedy?

839
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.010
One of the top executives
at Disney.

840
00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.620
It's not us, you guys.

841
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.780
I knew there was an explanation!

842
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.720
We didn't waste our time
at college!

843
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.090
We didn't get lazy
from technology!

844
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.890
Everything is
Kathleen Kennedy's fault!

845
00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.850
Follow me.
I'll help you find Eric.

846
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.970
Okay, okay,
everything is finally loaded.

847
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.770
We got Internet
at full capacity.

848
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.316
You guys ready
to see if this works?

849
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.210
- Yeah!
- All right, let's do this!

850
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:10.910
Launching Steam now.

851
00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.110
Steam?

852
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.540
Okay. I'm in Steam.

853
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.986
Got the application ready to go.

854
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:16.530
The title screen is launching!

855
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.780
It's working.
It's working, you guys!

856
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.340
It looks sweet
on this big monitor!

857
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.690
Wait a minute.
You mean this entire time,

858
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.696
all you've wanted to do
is play Baldur's Gate 3?

859
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.360
Yeah. What'd you think
I was trying to do?

860
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.306
We thought you were
trying to set up some elaborate

861
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:31.760
system to get
back to your universe!

862
00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.930
I ain't no
quantum astro physicist.

863
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.670
The fuck I know about
how the multiverse works?

864
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.370
Wow. It really is Cartman.

865
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.050
All right, that does it!

866
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.710
Get out of my room!

867
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.210
You have to be cool to me, Kyle.
PC Principal says so.

868
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:49.380
I don't care! All this multiple
universe stuff is tired and lazy

869
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.250
and we are not doing it anymore!

870
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.850
Boys! Boys,

871
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.766
we need to help Disney
put our universe back together.

872
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.090
Where's Eric Cartman?

873
00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:57.820
Dad, this might be hard
to understand,

874
00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.420
but this is Eric Cartman.

875
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.060
Okay, great.
Come on, Eric,

876
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.590
we need to go.

877
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.130
We have to hurry, Eric.

878
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.900
No. No, wait.

879
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.000
Something's wrong.
My God!

880
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.270
- What is it?
- My save game.

881
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.670
I'm already like 50 hours
into Baldur's Gate 3

882
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.040
but it's saying that
I have to start a new game.

883
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.710
Do save games not cross
between multiple universes?

884
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.156
Save games
don't even cross between

885
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.610
PCs and PS5s,
why would they cross

886
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.060
between multiple universes?

887
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.250
No...!

888
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.096
Please, everyone.
We are running out of time!

889
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.820
We have to close
the panderverse before

890
00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.590
everything we care about
is destroyed!

891
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:31.790
So what do we have to do?

892
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.060
We have to get everyone

893
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.830
back to the proper place,
but to breach

894
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.630
the panderverse,
we need to find a place

895
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.080
with integrity
that has a broken door.

896
00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.430
A place with "integridy"
that has a broken door.

897
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.120
I know where to go.

898
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.570
So, yeah, so it's just basically
off the hinges.

899
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.580
I'd fix it myself
but I've been really busy.

900
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.040
Do you think it'll work?

901
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.786
If we're to try to open
a panderverse portal,

902
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.650
it's as good as any place,
I suppose.

903
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.580
Okay, people,
we don't have much time.

904
00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.800
Bring in the panderstone.

905
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.860
I'm not your enemy, Eric.

906
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.130
For some reason
fate has put us together.

907
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.700
What do you want from me,
Kathleen Kennedy?

908
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.000
I've been stuck in
this universe for months.

909
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.070
I want out of here
just as much as you do.

910
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.100
Hello, welcome to City Woke,
can I take your order, please?

911
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.110
We're just having tea,
thank you.

912
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.110
Okay, you just wanna tea
and talk about

913
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.410
shitty male-dominated society,
that's fine.

914
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.450
I don't get it,
this is exactly the kind of

915
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.426
universe you wanted,
why would you want to leave?

916
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.170
To stop her from undoing
the panderverse completely.

917
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.590
I saw the panderstone
for the first time

918
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:41.990
a few years ago.

919
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.130
Bob Iger took us
to the Disney archives

920
00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:47.200
and showed us an ancient
piece of artificial intelligence

921
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.030
that could be used to make
the same movies over

922
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.920
and over again while appealing
to absolutely everyone.

923
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.270
The panderstone worked great,
for a while.

924
00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.540
But then came the hate mail.
Ugly letters from racists

925
00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.680
who couldn't stand
that some of the panderstone's

926
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.620
rehashes had diverse
women characters in the lead.

927
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.250
I decided I would show them.
I would start making movies

928
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.290
to fight all
the bigotry in our society.

929
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.490
But instead
of doing any real work,

930
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:18.860
I turned to the panderstone.
It made things so much easier.

931
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.400
Soon, I was using
the panderstone over

932
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.570
and over again to try
and fight all the ugly feedback,

933
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.620
which in turn was growing
stronger and stronger.

934
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.910
But I was fighting
with the wrong tool.

935
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.710
I used the panderstone
to the point

936
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.230
that it became unstable.

937
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.880
It opened a portal
to multiple universes,

938
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.800
and something came through.

939
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.760
At first we fought. I tried
to send it back to its universe.

940
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.460
But it got the upper hand.

941
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.100
It was able instead
to send me to this universe,

942
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.920
out of its way so
it could thrive in ours.

943
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.840
That's actually
the best explanation

944
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.280
I've heard as to why
Disney movies all suck now.

945
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.780
All right, I've set
the panderstone

946
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.520
into the compromised doorway.

947
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.870
Activating the panderstone now.

948
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.270
Whoa!

949
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.920
Space-time portal
is manifesting!

950
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.640
Panderverse
quantum fields are aligned!

951
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.190
Yeah, that sounds like typical
multiverse gobbledygook.

952
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.360
Will you stop ripping
on multiple universes, Kyle?

953
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.160
I'm trying to get back
to Baldur's Gate.

954
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.300
Now I warn you, Mr. Marsh,
once inside the panderverse,

955
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.346
you will be falling
through different realities.

956
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.310
Your mind will barely
be able to comprehend

957
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.910
- what you are experiencing.
- Randy?

958
00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.310
I think the oven door is
still having problems if you...

959
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.130
I am working on it, Sharon!

960
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.620
The portal is at full.
This might be our only shot!

961
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.520
Good luck, Mr. Marsh!

962
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.400
Whoa!

963
00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.880
Hold on to the rope!

964
00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.500
Whoa!

965
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.400
My God.

966
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.070
Whoa!

967
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.570
Whoa.

968
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.510
God, it's so weird.

969
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.510
Shorts, now I'm wearing shorts!

970
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.850
Can you imagine it?

971
00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.480
An infinite number of universes

972
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.690
with infinite combinations of
pants and shirts.

973
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.970
What do you think about
multiple universes now, boys?

974
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.610
Yeah, they're pretty
fucking stupid.

975
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.660
Yeah.

976
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.090
I understand that maybe

977
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.036
you were trying to
make a difference, Kathleen.

978
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.830
But you have to admit
the last few movies

979
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.590
you've shit out
have been real stinkers.

980
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.030
All I ever wanted was to

981
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.370
make great entertainment,
believe me.

982
00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:42.410
But as soon as you start getting
piles and piles of hate mail,

983
00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:45.010
endless messages
calling you the c-word,

984
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.910
you can't think straight.

985
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.680
Well, I'm sorry I wrote
all those letters.

986
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.480
It probably was a bit much.

987
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.790
No, I got like
10,000 letters a day.

988
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.596
I was doing more like
12,000 to 13,000,

989
00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.870
especially after the new
Indiana Jones came out.

990
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.830
Then it's you! You're the one
who caused all this!

991
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.800
Fuck you! You're the one
who caused all this!

992
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.730
I wouldn't have tried
to fight racism

993
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.036
with the panderstone
if you hadn't

994
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.200
written all those letters.

995
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.676
I wouldn't have written
all those letters

996
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.916
if you hadn't
tried to fight racism

997
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.570
with a fucking panderstone.

998
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.640
Mr. Marsh!
Can you hear us?

999
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.910
Wow!

1000
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.880
You should see
the pants I have on now!

1001
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.280
Whoa! Now I have on,
like, suspenders.

1002
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.220
Like almost like overalls
but not quite!

1003
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.420
My God.

1004
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.620
Mr. Marsh!
Try and stay focused!

1005
00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.320
You should be
seeing another portal soon!

1006
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.560
If our Kathleen Kennedy
got the other Eric Cartman

1007
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.060
to the right place.

1008
00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.830
My God! My God!

1009
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.330
Dad? What's the matter?

1010
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.630
I'm wearing a Baltimore Ravens
shirt now!

1011
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.230
I hate the Ravens!

1012
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.000
I don't know if I can do this!

1013
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.140
Now it's the Dolphins!
The Chiefs!

1014
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.940
It's the Chiefs!

1015
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.510
He's losing his mind!

1016
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.380
The panderverse
is filled with mystery

1017
00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.950
and paradox, you...
You have to try and hang on!

1018
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.400
Jesus, it's getting worse.

1019
00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.780
Where the fuck is Bob Iger?

1020
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.630
Mr. Iger
just had to take some

1021
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:17.370
of the others to a screening.

1022
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.400
I think that things
are being kept from me.

1023
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.910
And if you're going
to keep things from me,

1024
00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.480
then you'd better
put a chick in it,

1025
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.810
and make her
fucking gay as fuck.

1026
00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:37.920
So that's it,
that's the connection.

1027
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.860
I reacted to you
and you reacted to me.

1028
00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.490
And I guess
we created each other.

1029
00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:44.900
Mrs. Kennedy,

1030
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.276
I don't think
I've ever said this

1031
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.100
before in my life but...
I'm sorry.

1032
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.100
I lashed out so hard and used
the c-word so many times,

1033
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.500
you didn't really have
a choice but to double down.

1034
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.970
Eric, I know you care
about all things Disney.

1035
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.580
I'm sorry I was so reckless
with the things that you love.

1036
00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.610
It was just lazy.

1037
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.280
I guess just wailing

1038
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.970
on woke stuff all the time
is pretty lazy, too.

1039
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:21.510
I think...
I think I can let go now.

1040
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.760
Aah...

1041
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:37.600
Come on, Kate. Looks like
we got a flight to catch.

1042
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.560
Whoa, what the hell is that?

1043
00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:56.070
Yo, bitch!
You killed Kenny!

1044
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:58.280
You fat ho!

1045
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.100
Look!

1046
00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.570
I'm back, you guys!

1047
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.390
Kyle! Kyle, I'm back!

1048
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:20.070
I was so wrong
about Kathleen Kennedy,

1049
00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.660
Kyle, she's so awesome!

1050
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.930
Okay, what Cartman is this?

1051
00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.330
Mrs. Kennedy, you're back!

1052
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.730
- Great to see you, ma'am.
- Thanks, you guys.

1053
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.530
We have a lot of changes
to discuss at the company.

1054
00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:32.940
From now on we're only
going to make original content

1055
00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.570
that doesn't pander.

1056
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.670
Sure we will, Kate.
Sure we will.

1057
00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.030
Hey, guys! Guys, over here!

1058
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:44.050
I did a little extra work while
I was out in multiple universes.

1059
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.520
We're not gonna have a problem
with billionaires anymore,

1060
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.500
check it out!

1061
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.960
Now people who can do stuff
will be just as poor

1062
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.330
as the rest of us!

1063
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.700
Tom, it appears that
everything is back to normal.

1064
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.430
Billionaires have been put
in their place and once again

1065
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.300
it doesn't matter that we
don't know how to do anything.

1066
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.810
It's a good ending here
and we can all be happy

1067
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:14.460
that everyone
is back in their universe.

1068
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.190
Mom! Mom!

1069
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.090
What is it, Mrs. Kennedy?

1070
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:26.620
Mom!

1071
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.590
I was just having
the worst nightmare.

1072
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.230
I was me except everyone
around me was different.

1073
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:32.730
No, Mrs. Kennedy.

1074
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:36.300
Here, have some of your favorite
cereal to calm you down.

1075
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.530
Thank you. It was so real.

1076
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.330
All my friends were there
but they'd been

1077
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.500
replaced by strangers.

1078
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.410
I think you were even there
too, Kyle.

1079
00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.480
Really? I was there, too?

1080
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.240
Yeah, that's right, Kyle,
you were there

1081
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.486
but you weren't cereal
and I couldn't

1082
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:49.670
just eat you like I can here.

1083
00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.496
No, please, no, Mrs. Kennedy!

1084
00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.920
You're so yummy, Kyle!

1085
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.250
It's so good to be home.

1086
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.640
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1087
00:47:58.664 --> 00:48:00.664
