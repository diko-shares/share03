00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.793
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a young man</i>

2
00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:11.460
<i>who believed there was nothing
more important than a wish.</i>

3
00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:14.126
<i>Not just any wish, of course.</i>

4
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.710
<i>The one that drives your heart.</i>

5
00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.751
<i>The one that makes
you who you are.</i>

6
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.960
<i>But he also understood just
how impossible it can be</i>

7
00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:26.043
<i>to make that wish come true.</i>

8
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:29.751
<i>How easily dreams
can be destroyed.</i>

9
00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:33.918
<i>And so, he set out to
do something about it.</i>

10
00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:37.751
{\an8}<i>He studied the magic
of the world tirelessly</i>

11
00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:40.335
{\an8}<i>and became a mighty sorcerer,</i>

12
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.943
{\an8}<i>able to protect from
harm or ill will,</i>

13
00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:44.585
<i>any wish given to him,</i>

14
00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:47.043
<i>and for the good and the worthy,</i>

15
00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:48.626
<i>even grant that wish.</i>

16
00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:52.126
<i>The sorcerer didn't know if
the world would want his gift.</i>

17
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:57.543
<i>But he and his loyal wife
found the most perfect island</i>

18
00:01:57.626 --> 00:01:59.918
<i>deep in the Mediterranean Sea.</i>

19
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.168
<i>And there they built a
kingdom like no other,</i>

20
00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:06.126
<i>where anyone, any family,</i>

21
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.835
<i>no matter where they
came from, were welcome.</i>

22
00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:10.418
Can this boat go any faster?

23
00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.710
<i>And to their joy, people came,</i>

24
00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:17.168
<i>settled there from far and wide,</i>

25
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.126
<i>gave their wish and appreciation</i>

26
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.460
<i>for his protection,</i>

27
00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:24.001
<i>and with the very real hope
it could one day be granted.</i>

28
00:02:25.168 --> 00:02:27.001
And everyone agrees

29
00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:29.335
there is no one
more deserving...

30
00:02:29.418 --> 00:02:32.168
than my grandfather.

31
00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:35.460
A most loving...

32
00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:37.210
and handsome...

33
00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:39.251
man who turns 100
years old today.

34
00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:41.668
Oh, that's it?

35
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:43.191
Now you're done talking?

36
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:45.376
Valentino's never done talking.

37
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.085
If only we could understand you.

38
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.168
The King has called a
wish ceremony today!

39
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:52.710
Oh! Oh. Oh!

40
00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:53.793
This is it!

41
00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:55.043
No, it can't be a coincidence

42
00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:57.085
the King is calling
a wish ceremony

43
00:02:57.168 --> 00:02:58.335
on your birthday.

44
00:02:58.418 --> 00:03:00.335
Putt, putt, putt,
and knock on wood.

45
00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:02.335
Tonight's your night, <i>Saba.</i>

46
00:03:02.418 --> 00:03:03.460
I can feel it.

47
00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:05.168
Asha, let's bake a cake.

48
00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.376
Oh!

49
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.876
Uh...

50
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.918
- No.
- But I love cake.

51
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.793
I mean, I... I can't.

52
00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:13.918
- I'm giving a tour and then...
- Hmm.

53
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:16.335
Um, I'm helping.
I'm helping Dahlia.

54
00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:18.168
- Yeah. So, eh...
- Hmm.

55
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.126
- Why'd you say it like that?
- Like what?

56
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.335
What are you up to?

57
00:03:21.418 --> 00:03:22.894
What makes you think
that I'm up to something?

58
00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:24.543
Because I know your pauses.

59
00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:25.668
I'm maturing.

60
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.835
My pauses are changing.

61
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.680
Asha!

62
00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:28.877
Can't talk now,
I'm gonna be late.

63
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:29.901
Oh.

64
00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.172
I'll see you at
the wish ceremony.

65
00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:32.685
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

66
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.960
I've got a good
feeling about it!

67
00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:39.043
I'm here!

68
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.085
I'm here. I'm here.

69
00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:43.168
Whew! Just one second.

70
00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:44.876
Let me catch my breath.

71
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.126

Do you really forget your
wish once you give it?

125
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.376
You forget without regret.

126
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.543
- I want to meet the King.
- You're in luck.

127
00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:20.543
There's a wish ceremony tonight.

128
00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.852
You're welcome to
stay and watch.

129
00:06:21.876 --> 00:06:23.668
- I love food!
- Enjoy.

130
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.835
This is amazing!

131
00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.561
- I want to live here.
- So do I.

132
00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:29.293
- I'm never leaving.
- This is delicious!

133
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:34.251
- Help me!
- Huh?

134
00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:36.436
Best friend and honorary
doctor of all things rational,

135
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.043
my interview is in one hour,

136
00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:40.293
and I'm so nervous I think
I'm going to explode.

137
00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:42.296
Interview. What interview?

138
00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.501
Dahlia?

139
00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:46.293
You mean the interview
with our velvety sweet

140
00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:47.876
buttercream of a king.

141
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.269
Oh, please don't
say it like that.

142
00:06:49.293 --> 00:06:51.585
My best friend, the
King's apprentice.

143
00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:52.668
I'll be famous.

144
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:54.751
I have forgotten how to
talk. I have no words.

145
00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:57.251
Is my mouth drooping? I
feel like it's drooping.

146
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.085
Quick, ask me an
interview question.

147
00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:02.460
Okay, Asha, what's
your weakness?

148
00:07:02.543 --> 00:07:03.835
Weakness? Um...

149
00:07:03.918 --> 00:07:05.543
I get irrational
when I'm nervous.

150
00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:06.668
No, no.

151
00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:08.001
You care too much.

152
00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:09.793
I do? Wait. Is
that a weakness?

153
00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.251
That's why it's perfect.

154
00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:12.335
You're welcome.

155
00:07:12.418 --> 00:07:13.644
Just relax.

156
00:07:13.668 --> 00:07:15.793
You're surrounded by friends.

157
00:07:18.126 --> 00:07:19.293
Cookies?

158
00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:20.793
- Cookies.
- I like cookies.

159
00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:21.876
- Me first.
- Look out.

160
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.585
- Out of my way!
- Yes, yes, yes.

161
00:07:23.668 --> 00:07:24.668
Cookies.

162
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:25.751
Give me the cookies.

163
00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:27.335
- Out of the way!
- Slow down.

164
00:07:27.418 --> 00:07:29.019
- Move over. Okay, okay.
- I love cookies.

165
00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:30.683
- Safi, they're lemon.
- Oh, no.

166
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.293
Yes.

167
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.210
Ugh!

168
00:07:34.293 --> 00:07:36.418
Life is so unfair.

169
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:37.668
Take mine.

170
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:40.501
Bazeema, where
did you come from?

171
00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:41.835
Hi.

172
00:07:41.918 --> 00:07:43.626
Oh, take mine,
too. I can't eat.

173
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.835
Oh, right. Your
interview with the King.

174
00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:46.960
Hey, look at me.

175
00:07:47.043 --> 00:07:48.043
Don't worry.

176
00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:49.519
We'll be here for
you when you fail.

177
00:07:49.543 --> 00:07:50.585
Gabo.

178
00:07:50.668 --> 00:07:52.335
Oh, there are the cookies.

179
00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:53.793
Oh, Safi sneezed on those.

180
00:07:53.876 --> 00:07:54.918
Oh, thanks.

181
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:56.001
Ew.

182
00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:57.543
Anyway.

183
00:07:57.626 --> 00:07:59.666
Not that I blame you for
trying to cheat the system.

184
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.210
What? I'm not trying
to cheat at anything.

185
00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:04.126
Come on.

186
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.668
Everyone knows the racket.

187
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:08.210
The King's apprentices
get their wishes granted,

188
00:08:08.293 --> 00:08:11.293
and usually their
family's wishes, too.

189
00:08:11.626 --> 00:08:12.793
- Uh...
- Not always.

190
00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:14.251
- Mm-mm.
- Ooh.

191
00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:16.501
- Maybe always.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:08:16.585 --> 00:08:18.460
Wait, isn't your <i>Saba</i>
turning 100 today

193
00:08:18.543 --> 00:08:19.626
and still waiting?

194
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.350
- Ignore him.
- Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah!

195
00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.335
Not to mention the fact
that you're also turning 18.

196
00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:26.293
- Happy birthday.
- In a few months...

197
00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:28.335
not today.

198
00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:31.126
And when you give
your wish to the King,

199
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.500
you don't wanna have to end
up like Simon here, do you?

200
00:08:34.585 --> 00:08:36.710
Huh? What's wrong
with Simon here?

201
00:08:36.793 --> 00:08:38.085
It's... I don't know.

202
00:08:38.168 --> 00:08:40.335
You're kind of boring now.

203
00:08:40.835 --> 00:08:41.835
No offense.

204
00:08:41.918 --> 00:08:43.668
Have I become boring?

205
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.501
Do... Do you all think that?

206
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.210
- Achoo.
- No, not boring.

207
00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:49.376
- Just...
- Calmer.

208
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.460
Oh.

209
00:08:51.043 --> 00:08:53.210
Oh, Simon, don't worry.
You're still you,

210
00:08:53.293 --> 00:08:55.751
and I bet you'll get your
wish granted really soon.

211
00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:58.876
Unlike your poor old <i>Saba</i>
who's still waiting...

212
00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:03.835
The Queen.

213
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.078
- Your Majesty.
- Queen Amaya.

214
00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:06.126
Oh, my goodness.

215
00:09:06.668 --> 00:09:09.168
Asha, the King is ready for you.

216
00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:11.626
Now? Am I late? I thought I...

217
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.710
You're fine.

218
00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:13.977
The last interview...

219
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:17.460
It was a disaster!

220
00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:19.793
Finished early. Shall we?

221
00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:22.168
Oh, okay, I'm ready.

222
00:09:22.793 --> 00:09:24.126
I am so not ready.

223
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.210
You're fine.

224
00:09:25.293 --> 00:09:26.376
Just don't touch anything.

225
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.543
Don't forget to curtsy,

226
00:09:27.626 --> 00:09:28.852
- and tell him I love him.
- What?

227
00:09:28.876 --> 00:09:31.043
I'm kidding. Do
not tell him that.

228
00:09:31.126 --> 00:09:33.293
Great. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

229
00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:35.710
Bye. Don't get your hopes up.

230
00:09:39.585 --> 00:09:40.644
The apprentice

231
00:09:40.668 --> 00:09:41.948
should always keep
the fire going

232
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:44.043
because the King
likes his tea hot.

233
00:09:44.126 --> 00:09:46.085
- Uh-huh.
- He also likes to talk.

234
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:47.208
Quite a bit.

235
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:49.311
- Feel free to just listen.
- Oh, I'm a good listener.

236
00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:51.793
Some items might seem strange,

237
00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:54.418
but why a sorcerer needs
what a sorcerer needs

238
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:56.376
- is not your concern.
- Right.

239
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.793
And above all,

240
00:09:57.876 --> 00:09:59.460
do not expect to see the wishes.

241
00:09:59.543 --> 00:10:00.876
- Don't even ask.
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.001
I mean, I won't, Your Majesty.

243
00:10:04.126 --> 00:10:05.668
I'm rooting for you, Asha.

244
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:07.001
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:08.793
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

246
00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:11.085
But... why?

247
00:10:11.168 --> 00:10:13.960
Well, I see the way you
look out for others.

248
00:10:14.043 --> 00:10:16.043
It's clear how much
you love this kingdom

249
00:10:16.126 --> 00:10:17.460
and its people.

250
00:10:17.543 --> 00:10:19.251
Well, of course.

251
00:10:19.335 --> 00:10:21.751
That kind of generosity
has always been

252
00:10:21.835 --> 00:10:23.626
the true essence of Rosas.

253
00:10:24.835 --> 00:10:27.710
Now, are you ready
to meet the King?

254
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.335
Oh, I hope so.

255
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:37.168
Wow.

256
00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:39.126
He'll be right with you.

257
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.918
I'm going to check
on the ceremony.

258
00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:42.835
Oh, okay. Um...

259
00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:44.626
Bye.

260
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:55.543
Huh.

261
00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:02.543
<i>"Fire Magic,</i>

262
00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:04.585
<i>"History of Spells."</i>

263
00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:08.335
Whoa!

264
00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:17.293
- Huh. Oh!
- No, no. No, no.

265
00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:20.460
Asha, that book is forbidden.

266
00:11:20.543 --> 00:11:22.210
Oh. Hi. I was just, um...

267
00:11:22.293 --> 00:11:23.769
What's happening?

268
00:11:23.793 --> 00:11:27.001
Well, I put a spell on
the... on the glass.

269
00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:29.126
Well, I just thought the
etchings were pretty.

270
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.251
Yes, but the book...

271
00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:32.293
- the book is dangerous.
- Ow! Then why have it?

272
00:11:32.376 --> 00:11:34.543
A king must be prepared
for everything. Hold on.

273
00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:36.168
Hold still, hold still.

274
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:37.644
Oop! Don't move, I got it.

275
00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:38.668
No, no.

276
00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:42.918
- A bit of exercise.
- Shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo, shoo.

277
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:44.918
- Um, are you okay?
- Shoo, shoo.

278
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:46.668
No. I...

279
00:11:46.751 --> 00:11:48.501
I mean, yes.

280
00:11:48.585 --> 00:11:50.793
And I understand if
you want me to leave

281
00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.126
and never show my face again.

282
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.960
Oh, please, let's not overreact.

283
00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:56.960
You're here. You've
certainly got my attention.

284
00:11:57.043 --> 00:11:58.043
So, go ahead.

285
00:11:59.168 --> 00:12:01.418
Tell me why you think you
should be my apprentice.

286
00:12:01.501 --> 00:12:02.918
Okay, well...

287
00:12:06.543 --> 00:12:08.543
I care too much.

288
00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:12.085
Okay, that's interesting.

289
00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:13.335
It's my weakness.

290
00:12:13.418 --> 00:12:14.644
Figured I might as
well get through

291
00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:16.251
all the bad stuff
right up front.

292
00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.376
Fair enough.

293
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.751
And your strengths?

294
00:12:19.168 --> 00:12:20.335
Glad you asked.

295
00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:22.085
I'm a quick learner
and a hard worker,

296
00:12:22.168 --> 00:12:23.835
and I help well.

297
00:12:23.918 --> 00:12:25.668
And I'm young, so I'm malleable,

298
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:27.085
but not too young

299
00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:28.710
- so that I'm too malleable.
- Ah.

300
00:12:28.793 --> 00:12:30.376
Oh, and I like to draw.

301
00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:32.210
Is this anything?

302
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.085
Uh... What am I looking at?

303
00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:36.168
- It's a goat.
- Oh!

304
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:37.311
- It's hopping.
- Certainly.

305
00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:38.376
- See?
- Oh, again.

306
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.543
- It's hopping.
- That is a unique talent.

307
00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:41.668
Do we call that a talent?

308
00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:44.710
Oh, well, it's just something
my father taught me.

309
00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:47.293
I think I remember your father.

310
00:12:47.376 --> 00:12:49.210
- Really?
- He was a philosopher,

311
00:12:49.293 --> 00:12:50.668
wasn't he?

312
00:12:50.751 --> 00:12:52.710
Always talking about the stars.

313
00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:57.585
We used to climb that
tree on the high ridge,

314
00:12:57.668 --> 00:12:59.960
where it becomes just
you and the stars.

315
00:13:00.043 --> 00:13:01.168
You know, he'd say,

316
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:04.293
"The stars are
there to guide us,

317
00:13:04.376 --> 00:13:06.168
"to inspire us,

318
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:08.960
"to remind us to
believe in possibility."

319
00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:11.376
Well, even when he was sick,

320
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.751
he'd take me out
at night to dream.

321
00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:17.251
All I dreamed about
was him getting better.

322
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.043
How old were you when he passed?

323
00:13:20.585 --> 00:13:21.585
Twelve.

324
00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:24.126
That's not fair, is it?

325
00:13:26.626 --> 00:13:30.501
When I was young, I too
suffered great loss.

326
00:13:30.585 --> 00:13:32.918
I... I didn't know that.

327
00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:34.126
I'm sorry.

328
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.376
My entire family.

329
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.501
Our lands were destroyed
by selfish, greedy thieves.

330
00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:44.710
Hmm, if only I'd
known magic then.

331
00:13:45.335 --> 00:13:49.126
You see, I founded this kingdom

332
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.918
so there would be a place
where everyone is safe.

333
00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:55.210
Asha, no one should
ever have to see

334
00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:57.626
their dreams destroyed
before their eyes.

335
00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:00.501
No one should have
to live their life

336
00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:02.710
feeling the pain of
that loss every day.

337
00:14:03.335 --> 00:14:05.668
And that's why I do what I do.

338
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.543
And that's why I
want to work for you.

339
00:14:09.501 --> 00:14:11.918
Mm-hmm. Come with me.

340
00:14:22.418 --> 00:14:26.085
You're one of the very few
I have ever invited in here.

341
00:14:26.168 --> 00:14:27.835
But if I'm to trust you,

342
00:14:27.918 --> 00:14:29.585
I need to know you understand

343
00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:32.126
just how important they are.

344
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.543
"They"?

345
00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:36.126
The wishes of Rosas.

346
00:14:41.668 --> 00:14:43.960
You can feel them,
already, can't you?

347
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.335
They are everything.

348
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:50.835
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't
know why I said that.

349
00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:53.168
No, no, that's it.

350
00:14:53.835 --> 00:14:55.168
They are everything.

351
00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:59.376
I didn't expect them
to be so... alive.

352
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.043
Yes.

353
00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:02.668
You see,

354
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.001
people think wishes
are just ideas.

355
00:15:07.376 --> 00:15:10.460
But no, no, they are
a part of your heart.

356
00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:13.960
The very best part.

405

You know, Asha,

406
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.210
I would love to see someone
wish to be the best apprentice

407
00:18:21.293 --> 00:18:23.251
a mighty sorcerer has ever had.

408
00:18:24.043 --> 00:18:25.168
What do you say?

409
00:18:29.126 --> 00:18:30.126
Asha?

410
00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.668
It's my <i>Saba</i> Sabino's wish.

411
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.876
It's his birthday today,

412
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.668
and he's 100 years old.

413
00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:39.376
That's impressive.

414
00:18:40.668 --> 00:18:43.126
Your Majesty...

415
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.668
would you maybe consider

416
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:48.001
granting his wish tonight?

417
00:18:50.293 --> 00:18:52.876
Well, that was fast, wasn't it?

418
00:18:53.543 --> 00:18:57.335
You know, most people
wait a few months,

419
00:18:57.418 --> 00:18:58.918
even a year,

420
00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:01.418
before they start
asking me for things.

421
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:02.585
I'm so sorry.

422
00:19:02.668 --> 00:19:05.168
- I did not mean to...
- No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

423
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:06.876
Here, let me see the wish.

424
00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:10.335
It is a beautiful wish.

425
00:19:10.793 --> 00:19:11.876
Beautiful.

426
00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:13.585
Mm.

427
00:19:13.668 --> 00:19:15.376
But, unfortunately,

428
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.126
it's too dangerous.

429
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.210
Dangerous?

430
00:19:18.293 --> 00:19:20.710
Your <i>Saba</i> longs to
create something

431
00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:22.710
to inspire the next generation.

432
00:19:22.793 --> 00:19:26.085
Great wish but too vague.

433
00:19:26.168 --> 00:19:27.210
Create what?

434
00:19:27.293 --> 00:19:29.376
A rebellious mob, perhaps?

435
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.335
To inspire them
to... to do what?

436
00:19:31.418 --> 00:19:33.335
Uh, destroy Rosas, maybe?

437
00:19:33.418 --> 00:19:35.710
My <i>Saba</i> would never do
anything to hurt anyone.

438
00:19:35.793 --> 00:19:37.418
- You think that.
- I know that.

439
00:19:38.585 --> 00:19:41.043
Well, you're young. You
don't know anything, really.

440
00:19:41.126 --> 00:19:43.126
Whereas it is my responsibility

441
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.376
to only grant the wishes I
am sure are good for Rosas.

442
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.126
So, most of these wishes
will never be granted?

443
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.751
Yet I still protect them
like all the others.

444
00:19:55.918 --> 00:19:57.668
Can't you just give
them back instead?

445
00:19:58.085 --> 00:19:59.085
Excuse me?

446
00:19:59.168 --> 00:20:00.918
The wishes you're
not going to grant,

447
00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:02.918
you could just give them back.

448
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.001
Then, I don't know,

449
00:20:04.085 --> 00:20:07.168
the people can try to
pursue them themselves?

450
00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:08.477
You know, if they're dangerous,

451
00:20:08.501 --> 00:20:10.341
then they can be stopped,
but if they're not...

452
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.686
You've completely
missed the point.

453
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.126
People come here
because they know

454
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.251
they can't make their
own dreams come true.

455
00:20:15.335 --> 00:20:16.710
The journey's too hard.

456
00:20:16.793 --> 00:20:18.085
It is too unfair.

457
00:20:18.168 --> 00:20:20.460
They give their wishes
to me, willingly,

458
00:20:20.543 --> 00:20:24.668
and I make it so they
forget their worries.

459
00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:27.793
You make it so they forget

460
00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:30.043
the most beautiful
part of themselves.

461
00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:32.918
And they don't know
what they're missing.

462
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:34.793
But you do.

463
00:20:34.876 --> 00:20:36.626
And now I do.

464
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.376
It's not fair.

465
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.001
My <i>Saba</i> is good.

466
00:20:40.085 --> 00:20:42.168
The people of Rosas are good.

467
00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:44.001
They deserve more than...

468
00:20:44.085 --> 00:20:46.376
I decide what everyone deserves!

469
00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:52.751
<i>Mi Rey?</i>

470
00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:54.376
Sorry to interrupt.

471
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.710
But it's time for the ceremony.

472
00:20:55.793 --> 00:20:57.001
Is it, my love?

473
00:20:58.251 --> 00:21:00.668
Hmm. Seat Asha with
you on the main stage.

474
00:21:00.751 --> 00:21:02.418
Oh, no. No, no. It's okay.

475
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:04.001
I insist.

476
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:18.751
Are you ready, Rosas?

477
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.043
Another beautiful
night in my kingdom.

478
00:21:23.126 --> 00:21:25.751
So good to see you.
Good to be seen.

479
00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.710
First things first.

480
00:21:27.793 --> 00:21:31.251
We have two new citizens
ready to give their wishes.

481
00:21:32.543 --> 00:21:34.043
Helena, Esteban,

482
00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.835
you're going to be
very happy here,

483
00:21:35.918 --> 00:21:37.293
I promise you.

484
00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:39.335
Now make a wish

485
00:21:39.418 --> 00:21:41.585
and hold it in your heart.

486
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.168
It's a real weight
off, isn't it?

487
00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:53.210
Forget without regret. Whoo!

488
00:21:53.293 --> 00:21:54.418
Okay then,

489
00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:57.835
who is ready to have
their wish granted?

490
00:21:57.918 --> 00:21:59.418
Grant my wish! Over here!

491
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:02.418
Now, I have been
challenged today

492
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:04.210
to take a chance

493
00:22:04.293 --> 00:22:06.876
and try something new.

494
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.043
Thank you, Asha.

495
00:22:08.585 --> 00:22:12.376
And it is with clarity and
an open heart full of love

496
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.710
that I grant today's wish to
someone who has very patiently

497
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.793
- waited long enough.
- It has to be Sabino.

498
00:22:18.543 --> 00:22:20.960
Sania Osman.

499
00:22:21.043 --> 00:22:22.960
Where is Sania? There she is.

500
00:22:23.043 --> 00:22:24.227
- Come on up.
- He said, "Sania"? It's me?

501
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:26.710
It's me. It's me!

502
00:22:27.293 --> 00:22:29.585
Coming through, thank you.
It's just so exciting!

503
00:22:29.668 --> 00:22:31.835
Sania Osman...

504
00:22:31.918 --> 00:22:33.710
I mean it when I say

505
00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:39.251
it truly is my great pleasure
to grant your heart's desire

506
00:22:39.335 --> 00:22:42.543
to sew the most
beautiful dresses

507
00:22:42.626 --> 00:22:45.043
in all the land!

508
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:47.960
My wish has come true.

509
00:22:48.418 --> 00:22:50.585
- Poor <i>Saba.</i>
- He's waited so long.

510
00:22:50.668 --> 00:22:53.376
See, never, ever
get your hopes up.

511
00:22:54.543 --> 00:22:55.823
Asha.

512
00:22:56.126 --> 00:22:58.376
Obviously, I will
not be offering you

513
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.585
the position as my apprentice.

514
00:23:00.668 --> 00:23:01.751
But... But don't worry,

515
00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:03.460
I will still protect
your <i>Saba's</i> wish

516
00:23:03.543 --> 00:23:06.251
and your mother's, forever.

517
00:23:10.293 --> 00:23:11.793
<i>- Mi Rey?</i>
- Now that went well,

518
00:23:11.876 --> 00:23:12.876
don't you think?

519
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.043
Are you hungry?

520
00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:26.960
Come now, we don't waste food.

521
00:23:27.043 --> 00:23:28.835
Dig in and enjoy.

522
00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:30.543
You're right, <i>Saba.</i>

523
00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:32.876
We should be looking
at the bright side.

524
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.960
Asha,

525
00:23:34.043 --> 00:23:36.376
you got to the final
few being considered

526
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.626
for the most prestigious
position in the kingdom.

527
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.460
And <i>Saba,</i> there's
always next time.

528
00:23:42.543 --> 00:23:44.543
Cheers to that.

529
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:46.501
Asha?

530
00:23:48.085 --> 00:23:49.085
<i>Saba,</i>

531
00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:51.876
I need to tell you something.

532
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.418
Tell me what, child?

533
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.751
I don't think, um,

534
00:23:55.835 --> 00:23:57.585
your wish...

535
00:23:57.668 --> 00:23:59.460
- will ever be granted.
- What?

536
00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:01.376
Why would you say such a thing?

537
00:24:02.168 --> 00:24:03.876
Because the King told me so.

538
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:07.085
He said it's too
dangerous to grant.

539
00:24:08.043 --> 00:24:10.376
My wish is dangerous?

540
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.376
No. That's the thing.

541
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.960
I don't think it is at all.

542
00:24:14.043 --> 00:24:15.668
You... You saw it?

543
00:24:15.751 --> 00:24:16.835
I did.

544
00:24:16.918 --> 00:24:18.376
And you should know what it is.

545
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.460
No. No.

546
00:24:19.543 --> 00:24:21.460
Don't say anything.

547
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:24.126
But it's so, so beautiful.

548
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.335
Well, clearly Magnifico
feels otherwise, so...

549
00:24:27.418 --> 00:24:30.543
<i>Saba,</i> what gives him
the right to decide?

550
00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:33.168
He... He is the King

551
00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:35.751
and he has made everything
possible for us.

552
00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:38.876
If you had seen them,
if you had felt them

553
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.418
like I did, you
would understand.

554
00:24:40.501 --> 00:24:42.585
It's not just yours, <i>Saba.</i>

555
00:24:42.668 --> 00:24:46.001
There are so many
wondrous, powerful wishes

556
00:24:46.085 --> 00:24:47.293
that will never be granted,

557
00:24:47.376 --> 00:24:48.811
- just floating there...
- Asha? Asha!

558
00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:51.085
- Helpless.
- Sit down, calm down.

559
00:24:51.168 --> 00:24:53.876
I can't! I can't just
sit here with you,

560
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.126
<i>Saba,</i> knowing your
incredible wish

561
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.876
- and not tell you.
- Then don't.

562
00:24:58.126 --> 00:24:59.126
What?

563
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.876
You are excused from the table.

564
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960
<i>Saba?</i>

565
00:25:02.043 --> 00:25:05.043
Why? Why would you
want me to know a wish

566
00:25:05.126 --> 00:25:06.210
that can never be?

567
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:07.835
But I didn't...

568
00:25:07.918 --> 00:25:09.001
But it's your wish.

569
00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:12.251
Are you trying to
break my heart, child?

570
00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:13.835
No. No.

571
00:25:13.918 --> 00:25:16.335
I... I would
never, ever try...

572
00:25:16.418 --> 00:25:18.751
I'm sorry.

573
00:25:18.835 --> 00:25:20.376

Mmm.

624

Oh.

625
00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:17.960
What's happening?

626
00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:21.293
No. No, no, no.

627
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.210
<i>Mi Rey,</i>

628
00:29:31.293 --> 00:29:34.251
oh, you spoil us
with your magic.

629
00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:37.418
Whatever that was,
it was marvelous.

630
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:38.585
I didn't do it.

631
00:29:38.668 --> 00:29:39.668
What?

632
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:41.918
And it affected my wishes.

633
00:29:42.001 --> 00:29:44.918
Is it some sort of warning?

634
00:29:45.501 --> 00:29:47.960
I believe I have
just been threatened.

635
00:29:48.043 --> 00:29:49.918
Who would dare threaten you?

636
00:29:52.168 --> 00:29:54.001
What was that?

637
00:29:54.085 --> 00:29:56.210
You felt it, too, didn't you?

638
00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:59.460
It... It was electric.

639
00:29:59.543 --> 00:30:01.376
It was joy and hope

640
00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.043
and possibility and wonder...

641
00:30:04.126 --> 00:30:07.168
inside the most loving light.

642
00:30:07.251 --> 00:30:08.418
Can light be loving?

643
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:10.918
Ugh, I sound ridiculous,

644
00:30:11.001 --> 00:30:12.001
don't I?

645
00:30:13.168 --> 00:30:14.918
I'll take that as a yes.

646
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:16.710
Whoa! Whoa!

647
00:30:16.793 --> 00:30:18.710
Valentino!

648
00:30:29.543 --> 00:30:30.710
Stay back.

649
00:30:30.793 --> 00:30:31.793
Shh.

650
00:30:32.668 --> 00:30:34.751
Creepy.

651
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.501
Ooh?

652
00:30:40.543 --> 00:30:42.168
Wait.

653
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:44.251
No, no, no, no. Aah!

654
00:31:03.543 --> 00:31:05.710
Um, okay.

655
00:31:07.543 --> 00:31:08.876
Wh...

656
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.085
Whoa. Uh...

657
00:31:13.543 --> 00:31:15.376
Ho-ho there.

658
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.418
Aah!

659
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:19.668
Huh? Wait, what are you doing?

660
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:21.043
That is private.

661
00:31:21.126 --> 00:31:23.126
Ow!

662
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.751
Wh... What?

663
00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:26.168
What are you?

664
00:31:28.293 --> 00:31:30.585
You kind of look like...

665
00:31:33.835 --> 00:31:35.293
a star.

666
00:31:35.376 --> 00:31:37.001
Okay, you can't be.

667
00:31:37.085 --> 00:31:38.085
I mean,

668
00:31:38.168 --> 00:31:39.460
I know I wished on a...

669
00:31:39.543 --> 00:31:40.751
But...

670
00:31:40.835 --> 00:31:41.960
no.

671
00:31:42.835 --> 00:31:43.918
Yes?

672
00:31:52.835 --> 00:31:54.085
This is crazy.

673
00:31:54.168 --> 00:31:56.918
- We love crazy!
- Oh! I'm seeing things.

674
00:32:01.668 --> 00:32:03.001
Whoa, what are you doing?

675
00:32:03.085 --> 00:32:05.710
Valentino, don't eat that.

676
00:32:12.751 --> 00:32:13.894
It didn't work.

677
00:32:13.918 --> 00:32:15.668
When does the magic happen? Ah!

678
00:32:15.751 --> 00:32:17.168
Oh, something's happened.

679
00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:19.335
I'm talking! I am talking. Ha!

680
00:32:19.418 --> 00:32:21.376
Who knew my voice
would be this low?

681
00:32:26.751 --> 00:32:28.626
- Mmm.
- Delicious.

682
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:29.710
Magic is chewy.

683
00:32:29.793 --> 00:32:31.626
Sparkly and spicy.

684
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.710
Okay, I have a few thousand
questions, starting with,

685
00:32:35.793 --> 00:32:37.501
"How did I manage to
connect with a star

686
00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:39.001
"all the way across the sky?"

687
00:32:39.085 --> 00:32:40.585
and ending with,

688
00:32:40.668 --> 00:32:42.085
"How is any of this possible?"

689
00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:43.626
Just relax.

690
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:44.751
To all your questions,

691
00:32:44.835 --> 00:32:46.751
there is one very simple answer.

692
00:32:46.835 --> 00:32:48.793
Which is...?

693
00:32:48.876 --> 00:32:49.918
Well, think about it.

694
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.085
We're no different, you and me.

695
00:32:52.168 --> 00:32:53.710
We are all...

696
00:32:54.376 --> 00:32:55.501
Overwhelmed?

697
00:32:55.585 --> 00:32:58.251
And completely entirely
made of the very same,

698
00:32:58.335 --> 00:32:59.960
very special thing,

699
00:33:00.043 --> 00:33:01.585
which is...

700
00:33:02.168 --> 00:33:04.043
Hope?

701
00:33:04.876 --> 00:33:06.460

I've never felt so connected.

776
00:35:51.501 --> 00:35:52.602
We should do this more often.

777
00:35:52.626 --> 00:35:54.460
It's a shame we don't
get along better.

778
00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:56.126
Hey, thanks for not
eating me, John.

779
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.418
Don't mention it, Bambi.

780
00:35:57.501 --> 00:35:58.501
It's all good.

781
00:35:58.585 --> 00:36:01.376
This is extraordinary.

782
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.501
And my father said that we
were connected to the stars.

783
00:36:04.585 --> 00:36:06.626
That's why I wished

784
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.335
and now you're here...

785
00:36:08.418 --> 00:36:09.626
for me.

786
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:10.751
Well, what do I...

787
00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.335
Wait, do you grant wishes?

788
00:36:13.626 --> 00:36:15.710
Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry.

789
00:36:15.793 --> 00:36:16.793
Obviously not.

790
00:36:17.168 --> 00:36:18.293
Forget I asked.

791
00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:20.168
I'm just not sure
how this works.

792
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.085
I wished for more for
us, for my family,

793
00:36:24.168 --> 00:36:25.168
and for...

794
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.210
Oh. No, no, no, no.

795
00:36:27.293 --> 00:36:28.793
Not in, like, a selfish way.

796
00:36:28.876 --> 00:36:31.668
I just want their
wishes to have a chance.

797
00:36:32.085 --> 00:36:33.460
But, um...

798
00:36:34.126 --> 00:36:36.918
Look, see, King Magnifico has
their wishes in the castle,

799
00:36:37.001 --> 00:36:39.251
captured in these
ball-like, bubbly things

800
00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:41.126
that are very beautiful

801
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.710
but very locked up,

802
00:36:42.793 --> 00:36:44.543
and he'll never give them back.

803
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:46.335
What... What are you doing?

804
00:36:46.418 --> 00:36:47.585
Careful.

805
00:36:47.668 --> 00:36:49.835
My mother was shaved
for that yarn!

806
00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:53.418
Yes, that's the castle.

807
00:36:54.251 --> 00:36:55.251
You mean,

808
00:36:55.335 --> 00:36:57.460
we take them back ourselves?

809
00:36:59.543 --> 00:37:01.102
But if we take them,
isn't that stealing?

810
00:37:01.126 --> 00:37:02.210
I mean, we can't...

811
00:37:02.876 --> 00:37:03.960
Right,

812
00:37:04.043 --> 00:37:05.918
they don't belong
to him, do they?

813
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:07.585
Well, okay, but...

814
00:37:07.668 --> 00:37:09.460
Whoa! Wait, wait!

815
00:37:09.543 --> 00:37:11.585
Slow down. We need a plan!

816
00:37:12.793 --> 00:37:14.335
Ha-ha! Meant to do that.

817
00:37:14.418 --> 00:37:16.126
I'm coming!

818
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.460
Bye-bye!

819
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.793
What was it? What was it?

820
00:37:22.876 --> 00:37:24.626
Who could have commanded it?

821
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.251
Why is there nothing?

822
00:37:28.293 --> 00:37:30.626
<i>Mi Rey,</i> what has happened here?

823
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.168
I don't know who
we're dealing with,

824
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:34.251
and these books are useless!

825
00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:35.418
Just breathe.

826
00:37:35.501 --> 00:37:37.168
Do not tell me to breathe.

827
00:37:37.918 --> 00:37:39.918
Everything... Everything
I do is to make sure

828
00:37:40.001 --> 00:37:42.043
that never happens again.

829
00:37:43.585 --> 00:37:46.376
And when you're threatened,
you do not breathe.

830
00:37:47.793 --> 00:37:49.335
You focus.

831
00:37:52.918 --> 00:37:54.960
To summon such
light would demand

832
00:37:55.043 --> 00:37:56.460
a spell so powerful...

833
00:37:58.085 --> 00:38:00.335
No, you yourself say,

834
00:38:00.418 --> 00:38:02.668
"Forbidden magic
is not the way."

835
00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:04.835
A king must be
prepared to do anything

836
00:38:04.918 --> 00:38:06.293
to protect his kingdom.

837
00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:10.793
First, you must
protect yourself.

838
00:38:10.876 --> 00:38:12.043
That's what I'm doing.

839
00:38:12.126 --> 00:38:13.293
Not like this.

840
00:38:14.126 --> 00:38:15.543
We know nothing of these pages.

841
00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:18.751
You command great magic.

842
00:38:19.251 --> 00:38:21.168
But with this book,

843
00:38:21.251 --> 00:38:23.335
I fear it commanding you.

844
00:38:24.251 --> 00:38:26.918
Please, put that book down.

845
00:38:38.626 --> 00:38:40.251
If you want answers
about the light,

846
00:38:41.043 --> 00:38:43.793
I suggest you look
to your people.

847
00:38:43.876 --> 00:38:45.501
- They love you.
- I know.

848
00:38:45.585 --> 00:38:46.876
They would do anything for you.

849
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.019
Of course they would.

850
00:38:48.043 --> 00:38:51.085
You are their handsomest,
most beloved king.

851
00:38:51.168 --> 00:38:52.210
You're right.

852
00:38:52.293 --> 00:38:54.293
I am a handsome king.

853
00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:56.960
Oh, my love, excellent advice.

854
00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:59.751
Rosas is so lucky to have you.

855
00:38:59.835 --> 00:39:00.918
As am I.

856
00:39:03.585 --> 00:39:05.126
Everything is fine.

857
00:39:11.751 --> 00:39:13.168
Can you stop squiggling, please?

858
00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:14.960
You're drawing attention.

859
00:39:15.043 --> 00:39:16.251
Hi. Hello.

860
00:39:16.335 --> 00:39:18.918
You know, I'm just gonna...

861
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:21.001
What's in the bag?

862
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.960
Okay.

863
00:39:38.043 --> 00:39:39.376
You can come out now.

864
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.043
Oh.

865
00:39:41.126 --> 00:39:42.668
Are those pajamas?

866
00:39:42.751 --> 00:39:44.085
Ah!

867
00:39:44.168 --> 00:39:46.085
Thank you. I feel seen.

868
00:39:46.168 --> 00:39:47.501
Okay, focus.

869
00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:49.085
I need to talk to Dahlia.

870
00:39:49.168 --> 00:39:51.626
There has to be a way to
sneak into the King's study.

871
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.210
Without anyone seeing you.

872
00:39:57.293 --> 00:39:59.293
Yes, yes. I'm
way ahead of you.

873
00:39:59.376 --> 00:40:01.335
Star may alarm the masses.

874
00:40:01.418 --> 00:40:03.085
- Much like a talking goat.
- What?

875
00:40:03.168 --> 00:40:04.960
Which is why you're
both staying here.

876
00:40:05.043 --> 00:40:06.585
With the chickens?

877
00:40:06.668 --> 00:40:08.918
Did you see what just
came out of that one's...

878
00:40:09.001 --> 00:40:11.251
I'll be right
back. Stay quiet.

879
00:40:13.293 --> 00:40:14.352
Come on.

880
00:40:14.376 --> 00:40:16.001
Even you have to admit, Gabo,

881
00:40:16.085 --> 00:40:18.543
that light last
night felt amazing.

882
00:40:18.626 --> 00:40:20.335
It was probably a curse.

883
00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:21.460
- Cookies.
- Cookies.

884
00:40:21.543 --> 00:40:23.251
No! This batch is for the King!

885
00:40:23.335 --> 00:40:27.085
A squirrel just said
"Good morning" to me.

886
00:40:27.168 --> 00:40:28.460
I have no response to that.

887
00:40:28.543 --> 00:40:30.168
I didn't either. Right?

888
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:31.731
I mean, what do you
say to a squirrel?

889
00:40:35.585 --> 00:40:36.585
Oh!

890
00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:38.418
I really have to
watch where I'm going.

891
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:39.960
You touch 'em, you wash 'em.

892
00:40:40.043 --> 00:40:41.352
It was an accident.

893
00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:43.126
How? How do you always do that?

894
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.918
Hey, how are you and your
poor <i>Saba</i> this morning?

895
00:40:48.001 --> 00:40:50.251
- Oh, uh, coping.
- Hmm.

896
00:40:50.335 --> 00:40:51.335
And curious.

897
00:40:51.418 --> 00:40:53.251
How do the kitchens get
food up to the King?

898
00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:54.335
Oh, um,

899
00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:56.668
the formal servers bring his
meals to the dining room.

900
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.543
So, what about when the
King eats in his study?

901
00:41:03.626 --> 00:41:05.001
- What?
- Who brings it then?

902
00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:07.418
Well, his study is off-limits.

903
00:41:07.501 --> 00:41:10.585
Details are known to
only a select few.

904
00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:11.793
Including you?

905
00:41:11.876 --> 00:41:13.043
No comment.

906
00:41:13.126 --> 00:41:14.769
- Ladies, please.
- Who is in there?

907
00:41:14.793 --> 00:41:16.085
I don't hear anything.

908
00:41:16.168 --> 00:41:17.668
Dahlia, if you know a secret way

909
00:41:17.751 --> 00:41:19.793
into the King's study,
you have to tell me.

910
00:41:19.876 --> 00:41:21.960
Why? What is going on with you?

911
00:41:22.043 --> 00:41:24.293
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

912
00:41:25.168 --> 00:41:26.644
What are you doing?

913
00:41:26.668 --> 00:41:28.251
I... I gotta collect eggs.

914
00:41:28.335 --> 00:41:30.960
No! I mean, let me.
I'll do it for you.

915
00:41:31.043 --> 00:41:32.876
Nah, that's okay, Asha.

916
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.126
But your allergies!

917
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.335
All that sneezing. That
can't be good for you.

918
00:41:36.418 --> 00:41:39.668
Are you trying to take
the chickens away from me?

919
00:41:39.751 --> 00:41:41.668
You know Safi loves
those chickens.

920
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:43.418
- I do.
- Are you okay, Asha?

921
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:44.585
Something's up with you.

922
00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:46.293
- What are you hiding?
- Oh! Nothing.

923
00:41:46.376 --> 00:41:47.477
Life is to be lived!

924
00:41:47.501 --> 00:41:48.501
And nobody.

925
00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:50.519
- What is going on in there?
- Why are you all sweaty?

926
00:41:50.543 --> 00:41:51.626
You can tell us anything.

927
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.043
Move or we break the door down!

928
00:41:53.126 --> 00:41:54.293
No, no, no, no.

929
00:41:54.376 --> 00:41:56.335
Fine. Fine!

930
00:41:56.418 --> 00:41:58.501
Last night, after
everything happened,

931
00:41:58.585 --> 00:41:59.751
I made a wish...

932
00:42:00.543 --> 00:42:01.543
on a star.

933
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960
What are you, five?

934
00:42:04.043 --> 00:42:06.460
And the star answered.

935
00:42:13.793 --> 00:42:14.793
That's it, ladies.

936
00:42:14.876 --> 00:42:17.793
Your wings can't fly
but your voices can!

937
00:42:32.668 --> 00:42:34.918
Okay, ladies,

938
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:36.751
big finish!

939
00:42:48.376 --> 00:42:49.585
These are my friends.

940
00:42:49.668 --> 00:42:51.793
Oh!

941
00:42:51.876 --> 00:42:54.210
This is objectively impossible.

942
00:43:00.126 --> 00:43:02.835
What? Why am I making you sad?

943
00:43:02.918 --> 00:43:04.126
Oh.

944
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.960
Simon's 18.

945
00:43:06.043 --> 00:43:08.043
He's already given
his wish to the King.

946
00:43:08.126 --> 00:43:09.293
Huh.

947
00:43:09.376 --> 00:43:11.335
I can't remember what I lost.

948
00:43:11.418 --> 00:43:13.210
Oh.

949
00:43:13.293 --> 00:43:15.376
Don't accept it.

950
00:43:16.043 --> 00:43:18.293
No. Stay away. No, no, no, no!

951
00:43:18.376 --> 00:43:22.460
Am I the only one who realizes
this is gonna end very badly?

952
00:43:22.543 --> 00:43:25.126
Not if everyone keeps
quiet about Star.

953
00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.960
Magic is forbidden by
anyone other than Magnifico,

954
00:43:28.043 --> 00:43:30.793
who is also the
only one authorized

955
00:43:30.876 --> 00:43:32.710
to grant wishes.

956
00:43:32.793 --> 00:43:33.793
Self-authorized.

957
00:43:34.126 --> 00:43:36.001
Wait. Does Star grant wishes?

958
00:43:36.085 --> 00:43:39.751
No, but I think it wants
to help me pursue mine.

959
00:43:39.835 --> 00:43:41.876
Like a fairy godmother.

960
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.210
Life is not a fairytale.

961
00:43:44.293 --> 00:43:46.335
Whoa!

962
00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:48.168
What did you wish for?

963
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:49.835
No, you know what?

964
00:43:49.918 --> 00:43:51.585
Don't tell us. I
want no part of this.

965
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.835
That's the King's
call to assemble.

966
00:43:54.918 --> 00:43:58.460
Uh... Please, Magnifico
can't know about Star.

967
00:43:58.543 --> 00:44:01.793
And I promise, my wish won't
harm or affect any of you.

968
00:44:01.876 --> 00:44:03.043
Or Rosas.

969
00:44:04.751 --> 00:44:06.293
That's a big promise, Asha.

970
00:44:06.376 --> 00:44:07.626
But we trust you.

971
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.210
Don't we, Bazee...
Where did she go?

972
00:44:09.876 --> 00:44:11.835
How does she do that?

973
00:44:11.918 --> 00:44:13.876
It's okay. We won't
tell anyone, Asha.

974
00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.001
Right.

975
00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.335
About the chickens.

976
00:44:16.418 --> 00:44:17.793
We got you.

977
00:44:17.876 --> 00:44:19.376
Right, Gabo?

978
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.460
I don't squeal.

979
00:44:22.043 --> 00:44:24.251
- What are you not telling me?
- Okay. Okay.

980
00:44:24.335 --> 00:44:27.126
Yesterday, I kind of
challenged the King.

981
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.501
- What?
- It's, uh, complicated.

982
00:44:29.585 --> 00:44:31.626
And?

983
00:44:32.501 --> 00:44:35.001
Dahlia, what would you
do if you found out

984
00:44:35.085 --> 00:44:37.126
the wishes of those you
love with all your heart

985
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.501
will never be granted?

986
00:44:39.251 --> 00:44:40.835
You mean your <i>Saba's</i> wish.

987
00:44:40.918 --> 00:44:43.501
And, thanks to me, my mother's.

988
00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:44.793
I'm here to get their wishes,

989
00:44:44.876 --> 00:44:46.156
so I can give them back to them.

990
00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.710
You're here to
steal from the King?

991
00:44:48.793 --> 00:44:50.085
It's not stealing.

992
00:44:50.168 --> 00:44:51.626
The wishes don't belong to him.

993
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:52.918
And you can't just

994
00:44:53.001 --> 00:44:54.519
ask Magnifico for them back?

995
00:44:54.543 --> 00:44:55.960
I think I've ruined my chances

996
00:44:56.043 --> 00:44:57.960
of asking Magnifico
for anything.

997
00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:03.793
This is how we get food
to the King's study.

998
00:45:05.043 --> 00:45:07.293
It's perfect.

999
00:45:07.376 --> 00:45:08.896
- A new way to climb!
- Okay, look out!

1000
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.418
- We can't fit. Ugh!
- Backing up.

1001
00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:11.585
Are you sure about this?

1002
00:45:11.668 --> 00:45:13.585
Magnifico could
come back any time.

1003
00:45:13.668 --> 00:45:15.335
And that's why you're
gonna stall him.

1004
00:45:15.418 --> 00:45:16.561
Please and thank you,
best friend ever?

1005
00:45:16.585 --> 00:45:18.585
How am I supposed
to stall a king?

1006
00:45:18.668 --> 00:45:20.251
You'll think of something.

1007
00:45:20.335 --> 00:45:21.460
You're a genius!

1008
00:45:22.668 --> 00:45:23.977
- Ooh. To the left.
- Let's go up!

1009
00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:25.281
I have to reach
the pulley-thing.

1010
00:45:25.335 --> 00:45:27.043
And we ride!

1011
00:45:27.126 --> 00:45:29.251
I'm sorry, that was
right in your ear.

1012
00:45:31.543 --> 00:45:34.251
- I can't believe that light last night.
- That light was amazing...

1013
00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:35.668
Like nothing I've ever seen.

1014
00:45:35.751 --> 00:45:37.293
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

1015
00:45:37.376 --> 00:45:40.376
I know you are all wondering
about that little light

1016
00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.543
last night.

1017
00:45:43.335 --> 00:45:45.168
A light I did not
command or condone!

1018
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:46.311
Yeah!

1019
00:45:46.335 --> 00:45:48.043
- What?
- It was magic,

1020
00:45:48.126 --> 00:45:50.626
though quite clumsy
and amateurish.

1021
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.335
It was also
completely forbidden.

1022
00:45:53.418 --> 00:45:55.460
There is a traitor

1023
00:45:55.543 --> 00:45:57.001
amongst us...

1024
00:45:57.085 --> 00:45:58.668
who defied the law.

1025
00:45:59.085 --> 00:46:02.251
They used magic to
put you all at risk!

1026
00:46:02.335 --> 00:46:04.168
But don't worry,

1027
00:46:04.251 --> 00:46:05.835
they are no match for me.

1028
00:46:05.918 --> 00:46:07.043
And I assure you,

1029
00:46:07.126 --> 00:46:08.251
when caught...

1030
00:46:08.335 --> 00:46:10.835
they will be punished severely.

1031
00:46:10.918 --> 00:46:11.918
Asha.

1032
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:13.519
You are

1033
00:46:13.543 --> 00:46:14.585
awfully slow at this.

1034
00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:15.727
Shh!

1035
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:16.751
I think we're here.

1036
00:46:16.835 --> 00:46:18.561
Adventure awaits right
outside this door!

1037
00:46:18.585 --> 00:46:19.918
Let's go.

1038
00:46:20.001 --> 00:46:21.585
Oh, no.

1039
00:46:21.668 --> 00:46:23.251
No, no, no, no,
no. It's locked.

1040
00:46:23.335 --> 00:46:24.335
I'll ram it.

1041
00:46:25.793 --> 00:46:27.751
It hurts without horns.

1042
00:46:27.835 --> 00:46:29.001
What are you doing?

1043
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:32.251
Star, please don't
break anything.

1044
00:46:32.335 --> 00:46:34.376
Yes, but don't hold back.

1045
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.519
- What's happening?
- Just go all out.

1046
00:46:40.543 --> 00:46:42.793
Throw magic dust
everywhere! It'll be fine.

1047
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:45.085
Yes!

1048
00:46:45.168 --> 00:46:46.448
No!

1049
00:46:47.585 --> 00:46:48.644
Rosas needs you.

1050
00:46:48.668 --> 00:46:51.585
Any information would
be most helpful.

1051
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.335
And I know you will never, ever

1052
00:46:54.876 --> 00:46:56.168
let me down.

1053
00:46:56.251 --> 00:46:57.835
Thank you.

1054
00:46:59.918 --> 00:47:01.710
Your Majesty, wait!

1055
00:47:01.793 --> 00:47:03.251
Please!

1056
00:47:03.335 --> 00:47:05.668
Um...

1057
00:47:08.293 --> 00:47:09.585
Yes, go on.

1058
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.918
Ahem. Okay.

1059
00:47:12.001 --> 00:47:13.085
Hi. Hi. Uh...

1060
00:47:13.168 --> 00:47:15.210
Hi, I'm Dahlia.

1061
00:47:15.293 --> 00:47:17.460
I make your Magnifico cookies.

1062
00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:19.335
Fantastic. What can
I do for you, Dahlia?

1063
00:47:19.418 --> 00:47:21.710
Oh. Thank you for asking.

1064
00:47:22.876 --> 00:47:24.876
You said any information
would be helpful.

1065
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.418
- Uh-huh.
- But pragmatically speaking,

1066
00:47:27.501 --> 00:47:28.835
what qualifies?

1067
00:47:28.918 --> 00:47:29.918
Evidentiary?

1068
00:47:30.001 --> 00:47:31.751
How about circumstantial?

1069
00:47:31.835 --> 00:47:33.501
First hand? Ooh, second hand?

1070
00:47:33.585 --> 00:47:35.126
- What about hunches?
- Oh!

1071
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:36.210
Sure.

1072
00:47:36.293 --> 00:47:37.418
How about hunches?

1073
00:47:37.501 --> 00:47:39.376
Yes, any. Any information

1074
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.751
about who or what caused
the light would be helpful.

1075
00:47:41.835 --> 00:47:43.085
So, yes, hunch. Hunch away.

1076
00:47:43.168 --> 00:47:44.960
You said it was amateur magic,

1077
00:47:45.043 --> 00:47:46.376
but how come you don't know

1078
00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.585
- how they did it?
- What?

1079
00:47:47.668 --> 00:47:49.376
Perhaps you could
define "amateur"?

1080
00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.186
This is about what you know.

1081
00:47:52.835 --> 00:47:54.585
It is about your safety,

1082
00:47:54.668 --> 00:47:56.710
and most importantly, the
safety of your wishes.

1083
00:47:56.793 --> 00:47:59.710
Um, do you mean our
wishes aren't safe?

1084
00:47:59.793 --> 00:48:01.102
Of course they're safe!

1085
00:48:04.126 --> 00:48:05.626
Good as new.

1086
00:48:06.543 --> 00:48:08.126
Whew. Hope he didn't need those.

1087
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.085
Right, the wishes.

1088
00:48:10.835 --> 00:48:11.835
That's actually a door,

1089
00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:14.793
and Magnifico waved
his hand and it just...

1090
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.585
Okay, how about this? Nothing?

1091
00:48:18.668 --> 00:48:19.960
Or this?

1092
00:48:20.043 --> 00:48:22.126
This? Or this?

1093
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.001
- Yes!
- You got it!

1094
00:48:25.085 --> 00:48:26.335
Teamwork!

1095
00:48:48.585 --> 00:48:50.626
Star, I'm glad you
are having fun,

1096
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.293
but you have to focus.

1097
00:48:52.376 --> 00:48:54.210
Please, find my <i>Saba's</i>
and mother's wishes

1098
00:48:54.293 --> 00:48:55.918
as fast as you can!

1099
00:49:01.126 --> 00:49:02.960
How do we know our
wishes are safe?

1100
00:49:03.043 --> 00:49:04.043
We never see them.

1101
00:49:04.126 --> 00:49:06.001
Why can't we see them?
Why is that a rule?

1102
00:49:06.085 --> 00:49:07.543
And why can't we remember them?

1103
00:49:07.626 --> 00:49:09.043
One question at a time.

1104
00:49:09.126 --> 00:49:11.585
Since we're asking, what if
we want to change our wish?

1105
00:49:11.668 --> 00:49:13.418
Good point, wishes can change.

1106
00:49:13.501 --> 00:49:15.543
Let's form a line,
everyone will get a turn.

1107
00:49:15.626 --> 00:49:16.686
You know what'd comfort us?

1108
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.376
- Another wish ceremony.
- Yeah.

1109
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.293
It would make us all
feel so much better.

1110
00:49:20.376 --> 00:49:21.602
- Please, Your Majesty!
- We could do it now!

1111
00:49:21.626 --> 00:49:22.918
No! Not now! Bad timing!

1112
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:25.501
Wishes, wishes, wishes!

1113
00:49:25.585 --> 00:49:28.043
Silence!

1114
00:49:28.626 --> 00:49:30.626
Is that all you can think about?

1115
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.751
A Wish Granting Ceremony?

1116
00:49:32.835 --> 00:49:34.085
Mm-hmm.

1117
00:49:34.168 --> 00:49:36.501
Fine.

1118
00:49:36.585 --> 00:49:39.335
Whoever identifies the traitor,

1119
00:49:39.418 --> 00:49:40.960
your wish will be granted!

1120
00:49:41.043 --> 00:49:42.668
What?

1121
00:49:43.501 --> 00:49:44.710
But hear this!

1122
00:49:44.793 --> 00:49:46.543
Anyone who helps the traitor,

1123
00:49:46.626 --> 00:49:48.918
anyone who lets me down,

1124
00:49:49.001 --> 00:49:51.585
your wish will never be granted!

1125
00:49:53.418 --> 00:49:54.710
Wait! Your Majesty...

1126
00:49:54.793 --> 00:49:55.918
Enough!

1127
00:49:57.293 --> 00:49:59.126
How brazenly they question me!

1128
00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.335
They only question you

1129
00:50:00.418 --> 00:50:02.298
because you make them
feel safe enough to do so.

1130
00:50:02.376 --> 00:50:03.376
I'll be with the wishes.

1131
00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.960
Disturb me with
nothing but good news.

I was not afraid, Sakina.

1211
00:53:32.793 --> 00:53:34.251
Because, like all goats,

1212
00:53:34.335 --> 00:53:36.210
I believe the
greater the challenge

1213
00:53:36.293 --> 00:53:37.751
we are willing to face,

1214
00:53:37.835 --> 00:53:40.126
- the greater the life we live.
- Uh...

1215
00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:41.293
Oh, whoa!

1216
00:53:41.376 --> 00:53:42.626
<i>Saba,</i>

1217
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:44.376
I know you said you
didn't want to know

1218
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.001
a wish that could never be.

1219
00:53:46.085 --> 00:53:47.293
But now,

1220
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:49.793
you can make it be.

1221
00:53:50.668 --> 00:53:52.418
It's so simple,

1222
00:53:53.168 --> 00:53:54.418
so pure.

1223
00:53:54.501 --> 00:53:56.918
Asha, I know you think you're
doing a good thing, but...

1224
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:59.960
I should never have
given Magnifico my wish.

1225
00:54:00.043 --> 00:54:02.293
This...

1226
00:54:02.376 --> 00:54:05.793
This belongs to me.

1227
00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:14.501
<i>Saba...</i>

1228
00:54:15.001 --> 00:54:19.001
Oh, Asha, I may never
actually inspire anybody,

1229
00:54:19.085 --> 00:54:21.710
but now at least I
have the chance to try.

1230
00:54:24.085 --> 00:54:26.960
I'm going back for
your wish next, Mama.

1231
00:54:30.751 --> 00:54:32.418
That's right, Asha.

1232
00:54:32.501 --> 00:54:34.710
You've been turned in.

1233
00:54:34.793 --> 00:54:36.043
Where is it?

1234
00:54:36.126 --> 00:54:37.126
Where is the star?

1235
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:38.876
There's nothing here for you!

1236
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.251
How did you do it, huh?

1237
00:54:40.335 --> 00:54:41.918
What sorcery did you use?

1238
00:54:42.001 --> 00:54:43.376
I know no sorcery.

1239
00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.293
You ripped a star from the sky

1240
00:54:45.376 --> 00:54:46.793
and used it to steal from me.

1241
00:54:46.876 --> 00:54:48.501
The wishes don't belong to you.

1242
00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:51.043
You were never going to
grant my <i>Saba's</i> wish.

1243
00:54:51.126 --> 00:54:52.960
And he deserves to have it back.

1244
00:54:53.043 --> 00:54:55.585
- They all deserve...
- I told you,

1245
00:54:55.668 --> 00:54:57.626
I decide what they deserve.

1246
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:59.376
Please, Your Majesty.

1247
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.251
She made a mistake.
She won't do it again.

1248
00:55:01.668 --> 00:55:03.335
Oh, I know she won't.

1249
00:55:03.418 --> 00:55:05.168
Does this feel familiar,

1250
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:07.001
- Sakina?
- My wish.

1251
00:55:07.085 --> 00:55:11.501
Yes, your wish that you
gave to me for safekeeping,

1252
00:55:12.043 --> 00:55:13.668
because we all know what happens

1253
00:55:13.751 --> 00:55:15.251
to wishes out in this...

1254
00:55:15.335 --> 00:55:17.251
this real world.

1255
00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:19.251
They get crushed.

1256
00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:22.251
- Mama!
- Sakina. No!

1257
00:55:22.835 --> 00:55:25.293
Ooh, what is this?

1258
00:55:26.626 --> 00:55:28.210
What a gift.

1259
00:55:28.293 --> 00:55:31.501
All this time, I've protected
the wishes not knowing

1260
00:55:31.585 --> 00:55:33.960
the power they yield.

1261
00:55:34.043 --> 00:55:36.876
I feel as if I can do...

1262
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.960
anything.

1263
00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.335
The star.

1264
00:55:46.418 --> 00:55:47.835
I must have it.

1265
00:55:50.668 --> 00:55:52.126
Let's go! Now!

1266
00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:53.936
What is that?
- Hey!

1267
00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.668
- Is this yarn?
- Hurry, hurry.

1268
00:55:57.168 --> 00:55:59.126
From one domesticated
animal to another,

1269
00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:00.210
help us!

1270
00:56:01.668 --> 00:56:02.727
Careful.

1271
00:56:02.751 --> 00:56:04.543
That's it, Sakina. Hold on!

1272
00:56:04.626 --> 00:56:06.168
Whoa...

1273
00:56:17.876 --> 00:56:19.460
We've run out of land.

1274
00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:20.793
There's a boat.

1275
00:56:21.376 --> 00:56:22.376
Hurry.

1276
00:56:26.751 --> 00:56:28.251
Go, return to your stables.

1277
00:56:28.335 --> 00:56:30.876
If anyone asks, play dumb.

1278
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.769
I say we head for the islet.

1279
00:56:32.793 --> 00:56:33.793
It's closest.

1280
00:56:33.876 --> 00:56:35.835
We can hide there.

1281
00:56:38.751 --> 00:56:40.543
Oh, thank you.

1282
00:56:41.918 --> 00:56:43.251
Mama?

1283
00:56:43.335 --> 00:56:45.460
My heart knows this feeling.

1284
00:56:46.293 --> 00:56:47.793
This is grief.

1285
00:56:47.876 --> 00:56:50.335
Oh, I didn't mean
for this to happen.

1286
00:56:51.168 --> 00:56:53.126
I know, baby.

1287
00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:56.585
I was foolish to think
I could change anything.

1288
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:58.960
I should never have wished.

1289
00:57:05.585 --> 00:57:07.001
It's true.

1290
00:57:07.085 --> 00:57:09.918
My wish has ruined
everything for my family.

1291
00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:12.460
And now everyone
in Rosas is at risk

1292
00:57:12.543 --> 00:57:13.876
because of me.

1293
00:57:15.668 --> 00:57:17.376
Oh, Asha, no.

1294
00:57:18.376 --> 00:57:19.793
Everyone is at risk

1295
00:57:20.668 --> 00:57:22.418
because of Magnifico.

1296
00:57:22.501 --> 00:57:24.543
Our dear Rosas.

1297
00:57:24.626 --> 00:57:27.085
Your father's heart would break

1298
00:57:27.168 --> 00:57:28.876
for what we now know.

1299
00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:43.960
I know what you're thinking

1300
00:57:44.043 --> 00:57:45.960
because I'm thinking it, too.

1301
00:57:50.626 --> 00:57:52.918
- I love you both very much.
- What is going on?

1302
00:57:53.001 --> 00:57:54.394
- When you get to the islet...
- Asha.

1303
00:57:54.418 --> 00:57:56.144
- Stay hidden from view.
- What are you doing?

1304
00:57:56.168 --> 00:57:57.168
I have to stop him.

1305
00:57:57.251 --> 00:57:58.418
- No!
- It's too dangerous!

1306
00:57:58.501 --> 00:58:00.001
I started this.

1307
00:58:00.085 --> 00:58:01.543
I have to finish it...

1308
00:58:01.626 --> 00:58:03.626
for everyone.

1309
00:58:04.126 --> 00:58:05.585
- Asha!
- No!

1310
00:58:05.668 --> 00:58:07.710
I cannot swim!

1311
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.126
Perfect.

1312
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:12.585
- Shark!
- What?

1313
00:58:12.668 --> 00:58:14.251
No, no. I... I have
not seen a shark.

1314
00:58:14.335 --> 00:58:15.543
I'm just practicing.

1315
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.918
To harness a star...

1316
00:58:23.001 --> 00:58:24.960
Ooh, a staff.

1317
00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:26.168
A staff of such power,

1318
00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:29.918
even the night will
bow to my command.

1319
00:58:31.585 --> 00:58:32.626
Perfect.

1320
00:58:33.168 --> 00:58:35.418
One branch of mountain ash

1321
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:38.168
bathed in Tollen's potion.

1322
00:58:38.251 --> 00:58:40.251
Molten iron for strength,

1323
00:58:40.335 --> 00:58:42.251
copper for a strike.

1324
00:58:42.335 --> 00:58:44.001
And most important,

1325
00:58:44.085 --> 00:58:45.168
the power cast

1326
00:58:45.251 --> 00:58:48.918
from the innocent
hearts of three.

1327
00:58:49.001 --> 00:58:51.460
You dared to question me

1328
00:58:51.543 --> 00:58:54.168
and all that I do for you.

1329
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:58.001
You don't deserve to be granted.

1330
00:58:58.085 --> 00:58:59.793
But, through me,

1331
00:58:59.876 --> 00:59:03.168
you may serve a greater purpose.

1332
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:06.293
My love.

1333
00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.585
Such sadness.

1334
00:59:17.418 --> 00:59:18.460
Yes!

1335
00:59:19.751 --> 00:59:21.293
Yes!

1336
00:59:23.876 --> 00:59:26.251
Yes!

1337
00:59:28.918 --> 00:59:31.251
Amaya, darling, come! Come!

1338
00:59:31.335 --> 00:59:34.168
You're just in time
to meet my new toy!

1339
00:59:35.543 --> 00:59:37.751
Now, that is power.

1340
00:59:37.835 --> 00:59:38.835
Am I glowing?

1341
00:59:38.918 --> 00:59:40.460
I feel as if I am. Yes?

1342
00:59:41.251 --> 00:59:42.626
How could you?

1343
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:44.543
You know the ways of
forbidden magic are...

1344
00:59:44.626 --> 00:59:46.043
Unappreciated.

1345
00:59:46.126 --> 00:59:48.085
Much like I am by my own people.

1346
00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:49.335
By that girl.

1347
00:59:49.418 --> 00:59:50.585
She did this.

1348
00:59:50.668 --> 00:59:52.710
She pulled a star from the sky

1349
00:59:52.793 --> 00:59:54.710
to destroy everything
I've built.

1350
00:59:54.793 --> 00:59:55.960
Asha?

1351
00:59:56.043 --> 00:59:58.626
No, she only wanted her
family's wishes back.

1352
01:00:00.168 --> 01:00:03.085
Do you side with
the traitor, Amaya?

1353
01:00:03.751 --> 01:00:05.876
No. No.

1354
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.793
You know I would never side
with a traitor of Rosas.

1355
01:00:12.543 --> 01:00:15.293
I have believed in you
from the moment we met.

1356
01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:17.751
We built this kingdom together.

1357
01:00:17.835 --> 01:00:20.210
There is nothing more
important than that.

1358
01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.626
Wonderful.

1359
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:25.460
Now, let's go set the stage.

1360
01:00:25.543 --> 01:00:28.251
I'm on the hunt!

1361
01:00:40.335 --> 01:00:43.043
You know, all of this is
just a bump in the road.

1362
01:00:43.126 --> 01:00:46.210
A gigantically, humongous bump.

1363
01:00:47.668 --> 01:00:49.501
We have to find
Dahlia and the others.

1364
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.376
All I see are feet.

1365
01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.751
Look at these poor people!

1366
01:00:53.835 --> 01:00:57.376
Asha stole and
destroyed their wishes.

1367
01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.668
She must pay!

1368
01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:01.376
They say her family's
gone missing.

1369
01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.543
I bet she killed them.

1370
01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:05.293
This whole thing feels wrong.

1371
01:01:16.168 --> 01:01:18.335
Your faces!

1372
01:01:18.418 --> 01:01:20.793
It's okay. You're okay.

1373
01:01:20.876 --> 01:01:23.418
It's just a play on light.

1374
01:01:23.501 --> 01:01:25.710
You know I love you, Rosas.

1375
01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:29.085
The Queen looks scared.

1376
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.251
Okay, okay, enough play.

1377
01:01:34.418 --> 01:01:35.960
I think we're thinking
the same thing

1378
01:01:36.043 --> 01:01:37.126
again.

1379
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:38.501
W-W-Wait, discreetly!

1380
01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:45.793
You are all probably
wondering why you are here.

1381
01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:48.210
Yes, there's a savage teenager
running around with a star,

1382
01:01:48.293 --> 01:01:49.751
destroying wishes. But...

1383
01:01:50.418 --> 01:01:52.710
guess who bravely came forward

1384
01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:54.335
and identified her.

1385
01:01:55.418 --> 01:01:57.751
Give a big cheer for

1386
01:01:57.835 --> 01:02:00.168
Simon O'Donohue!

1387
01:02:00.251 --> 01:02:02.418
Simon?

1388
01:02:03.751 --> 01:02:06.001
I know, I know!

1389
01:02:06.085 --> 01:02:08.293
Tell me, I was as
surprised as you all.

1390
01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:10.335
Our sleepy little Simon here.

1391
01:02:10.418 --> 01:02:11.852
No need to be nervous, Simon.

1392
01:02:11.876 --> 01:02:13.626
Be proud! Show us your joy!

1393
01:02:14.585 --> 01:02:15.918
- Your Majesty?
- Oh, my.

1394
01:02:16.001 --> 01:02:17.751
I know, a talking mouse,

1395
01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:18.835
but don't panic.

1396
01:02:18.918 --> 01:02:20.001
I'm very clean,

1397
01:02:20.085 --> 01:02:22.126
and I have an important
message for you.

1398
01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:23.793
"You once said,

1399
01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:26.376
'Generosity is the
true essence of Rosas.'

1400
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.835
"I can see your fear,

1401
01:02:27.918 --> 01:02:30.293
"but Rosas needs your help now.

1402
01:02:30.376 --> 01:02:31.751
"Love, Asha."

1403
01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:33.710
The "love" part was my idea.

1404
01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:35.126
Okay. Bye.

1405
01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.501
So, my dear Simon,

1406
01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:38.751
are you ready

1407
01:02:38.835 --> 01:02:41.501
to see your wish?

1408
01:02:42.668 --> 01:02:45.001
To be the King's most valiant,

1409
01:02:45.085 --> 01:02:47.168
courageous, and loyal knight!

1410
01:02:47.251 --> 01:02:49.043
Just not a loyal friend.

1411
01:02:49.126 --> 01:02:51.835
It is my great pleasure

1412
01:02:51.918 --> 01:02:54.876
to grant you your
heart's desire.

1413
01:03:11.501 --> 01:03:13.460
Long live the King!

1414
01:03:13.543 --> 01:03:15.418
Long live the King!

1415
01:03:15.501 --> 01:03:17.835
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

1416
01:03:17.918 --> 01:03:20.335
There are six more
traitors, Your Majesty.

1417
01:03:20.418 --> 01:03:22.793
Dahlia, Gabo, Dario,

1418
01:03:22.876 --> 01:03:24.168
Safi, Hal

1419
01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:25.918
and Bazeema.

1420
01:03:26.001 --> 01:03:28.918
Find them, so they may
pay for their betrayal.

1421
01:03:29.001 --> 01:03:31.793
Find Asha, so you
may be rewarded.

1422
01:03:31.876 --> 01:03:33.168
But most importantly,

1423
01:03:33.251 --> 01:03:35.043
find me that star,

1424
01:03:35.126 --> 01:03:36.835
so I will have the power

1425
01:03:36.918 --> 01:03:39.626
to grant all of your wishes!

1426
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:49.793
It's a dead end.

1427
01:03:49.876 --> 01:03:52.835
A dead end with
un-sanded mahogany.

1428
01:03:56.126 --> 01:03:57.876
Oh! Good find, Valentino.

1429
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.210
My butt found it.

1430
01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:00.418
Whoa!

1431
01:04:00.501 --> 01:04:02.751
So, this is where you go

1432
01:04:02.835 --> 01:04:04.585
when you sneak
off, huh, Bazeema?

1433
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:06.835
Thanks for keeping
it all to yourself.

1434
01:04:06.918 --> 01:04:09.376
Introverts deserve sanctuary.

1435
01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.001
I'm happy for you.

1436
01:04:11.085 --> 01:04:12.710
We're safe here.

1437
01:04:12.793 --> 01:04:14.376
No, we're not safe anywhere.

1438
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.376
We're fugitives, thanks to Asha.

1439
01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.626
She said she just wanted

1440
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:19.061
her family to have
their wishes back.

1441
01:04:19.085 --> 01:04:20.251
Oh, and you believed her?

1442
01:04:20.335 --> 01:04:22.168
It's the truth, Gabo.

1443
01:04:22.251 --> 01:04:24.335
- Hide!
- We're all gonna die!

1444
01:04:24.418 --> 01:04:26.293
Oh! Hey, Asha.

1445
01:04:26.376 --> 01:04:27.793
Please say you didn't destroy...

1446
01:04:27.876 --> 01:04:29.556
those people's wishes?

1447
01:04:29.626 --> 01:04:30.960
Of course I didn't.

1448
01:04:31.043 --> 01:04:32.085
It was Magnifico.

1449
01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:33.543
Likely story.

1450
01:04:33.626 --> 01:04:36.460
Wait, the King was
acting awfully,

1451
01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:38.168
awfully...

1452
01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:39.251
Awful.

1453
01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:41.210
Simon looked like
he was in pain.

1454
01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:43.335
Yeah, right before
he snitched on us.

1455
01:04:43.418 --> 01:04:45.293
We're doomed!

1456
01:04:46.293 --> 01:04:47.960

1525
01:08:11.585 --> 01:08:13.418
Oh! Hi.

1526
01:08:13.501 --> 01:08:16.793
Your Majesty, this is Star.

1527
01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:19.168
You are extraordinary.

1528
01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:21.168
You need to know,

1529
01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:24.460
Magnifico has embraced
a most corrupt magic.

1530
01:08:24.543 --> 01:08:26.625
He is intent on capturing Star.

1531
01:08:27.418 --> 01:08:29.918
He wants to take all of
your energy for himself.

1532
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.125
Then Star needs to
leave, like, right now.

1533
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:34.375
No, no. If anyone's leaving,

1534
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.460
it's gonna be you.

1535
01:08:35.543 --> 01:08:38.168
Star won't go until
those wishes are free.

1536
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:39.835
Does that mean you have a plan?

1537
01:08:39.918 --> 01:08:42.960
Of course we have a plan.

1538
01:08:43.543 --> 01:08:47.085
Oh! Fantasyland
in the sky, huh?

1539
01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:51.085
How about Neverland?

1540
01:08:51.168 --> 01:08:54.000
The perfect nanny for
your horrible children?

1541
01:08:54.085 --> 01:08:55.293
Poppin' this one!

1542
01:08:57.585 --> 01:09:00.543
Oh! True love, how sweet.

1543
01:09:01.793 --> 01:09:03.460
So much for true love.

1544
01:09:04.835 --> 01:09:06.585
<i>Mi Rey!</i>

1545
01:09:06.668 --> 01:09:09.085
Asha and Star have been
spotted in the forest.

1546
01:09:09.168 --> 01:09:10.793
Is that so?

1547
01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:12.000
How fortunate.

1548
01:09:12.085 --> 01:09:14.460
Shall we gather the citizens,

1549
01:09:14.543 --> 01:09:15.875
so they can see you capture her?

1550
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.793
Oh, we've been gathering them
a lot lately, don't you think?

1551
01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:22.085
- I, um...
- Oh, I'm kidding!

1552
01:09:22.168 --> 01:09:23.811
Sound the trumpets, Amaya.

1553
01:09:23.835 --> 01:09:26.125
I'll bring back the
girl and the star!

1554
01:09:34.043 --> 01:09:35.875
Okay. We must work quickly.

1555
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.043
And quietly!

1556
01:09:39.168 --> 01:09:41.375
I'll lead Magnifico as
far away as possible.

1557
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.851
And as soon as he
leaves the castle,

1558
01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:44.543
you go help the others
free the wishes.

1559
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:46.918
I know, okay?

1560
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.460
I'm worried, too.

1561
01:09:48.543 --> 01:09:50.585
Wait. What are you doing?

1562
01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:53.210
Oh, a stick.

1563
01:09:55.918 --> 01:09:57.585
Okay.

1564
01:09:57.668 --> 01:09:58.793
What do I do with this?

1565
01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:01.251
Oh!

1566
01:10:01.335 --> 01:10:03.251
Ha! It's magic.

1567
01:10:03.335 --> 01:10:05.543
Thank you.

1568
01:10:05.626 --> 01:10:07.585
You have to go. Go now.

1569
01:10:08.918 --> 01:10:10.626
Okay. I can do this.

1570
01:10:11.793 --> 01:10:13.085
What?

1571
01:10:13.168 --> 01:10:14.960
Come on, come on, come on, pl...

1572
01:10:18.293 --> 01:10:20.001
Okay.

1573
01:10:20.085 --> 01:10:21.585
Good luck, Asha!

1574
01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:28.293
Challenge accepted.

1575
01:10:36.126 --> 01:10:37.376
Wow. HAL: Hi.

1576
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:38.751
Whoa!

1577
01:10:39.418 --> 01:10:42.043
Through the heart we
understand the world.

1578
01:10:43.251 --> 01:10:45.085
- Oh, look, hot drinks.
- Nah-uh-uh.

1579
01:10:45.168 --> 01:10:46.793
Star! You're here!

1580
01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:47.960
Oh, thank goodness!

1581
01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.376
This is it, everyone.

1582
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.585
First we open the roof,

1583
01:10:50.668 --> 01:10:52.751
and then Star
returns the wishes.

1584
01:10:52.835 --> 01:10:55.918
The Queen said we need to
look for giant pulleys.

1585
01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:58.376
Maybe these pulleys?

1586
01:10:58.793 --> 01:10:59.876
Start climbing!

1587
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.668
As my mother always said,

1588
01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:03.460
"If someone falls,

1589
01:11:03.543 --> 01:11:05.126
"leave them!"

1590
01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.918
No, buddy, we're not doing that.

1591
01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:09.085
You can come back 'cause
I... I hate heights.

1592
01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:13.085
Oh, nice!

1593
01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:15.126
And away we go!

1594
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:17.293
Wow. GABO: Oh, this is high.

1595
01:11:39.793 --> 01:11:41.126
Here. Obsidian oil

1596
01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:42.668
for protection from the pages.

1597
01:11:43.085 --> 01:11:46.751
This reads like a recipe book
for the foul and the savage.

1598
01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:49.126
Look for anything on
how to break his staff,

1599
01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:51.835
bind his magic, or
at the very least,

1600
01:11:52.668 --> 01:11:54.085
break the hold it has on him.

1601
01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:07.918
I don't get you at all!

1602
01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.043
It won't move!

1603
01:12:13.126 --> 01:12:14.251
I'm trying my hardest.

1604
01:12:14.335 --> 01:12:15.585
Hey, Dario, buddy!

1605
01:12:15.668 --> 01:12:17.543
It's called a
pulley for a reason!

1606
01:12:17.626 --> 01:12:19.210
This is no time for riddles!

1607
01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:22.043
Come on. It's as obvious
as my baby beard.

1608
01:12:22.126 --> 01:12:23.210
You must pull together.

1609
01:12:23.293 --> 01:12:24.376
On my count.

1610
01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.376
One. Two.

1611
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.168
Nine zillyboo.

1612
01:12:28.251 --> 01:12:29.543
Twenty alphabet.

1613
01:12:29.626 --> 01:12:30.751
Wait, what?

1614
01:12:30.835 --> 01:12:32.126
I... I can't count.

1615
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:33.251
Now!

1616
01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:37.460
That's it. Give
it all you've got!

1617
01:12:43.585 --> 01:12:45.543
No!

1618
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.126
Oh, he's become
practically untouchable.

1619
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:49.460
No metal can break his staff.

1620
01:12:49.543 --> 01:12:51.168
No spell can bind his magic.

1621
01:12:51.251 --> 01:12:53.460
And no one can bring
him back from this.

1622
01:12:54.043 --> 01:12:56.835
"Embrace forbidden
magic just once,

1623
01:12:56.918 --> 01:12:59.543
"and you commit to
it for eternity."

1624
01:13:02.793 --> 01:13:03.793
Whoa!

1625
01:13:03.876 --> 01:13:05.585
I can't turn, I can't
turn, I can't turn!

1626
01:13:05.668 --> 01:13:08.085
Whoa, I can't stop staring.

1627
01:13:08.168 --> 01:13:09.668
Work for me, stick.

1628
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:11.001
Oh!

1629
01:13:11.376 --> 01:13:12.418
Oh, dear.

1630
01:13:18.793 --> 01:13:20.710
- We need more weight!
- Hmm.

1631
01:13:21.126 --> 01:13:24.460
Well, it's not
falling if you jump.

1632
01:13:24.543 --> 01:13:27.293
All right, fine!

1633
01:13:27.376 --> 01:13:29.251
For Rosas!

1634
01:13:29.335 --> 01:13:30.418
Jump, everyone!

1635
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.376
I'm gonna die!

1636
01:13:35.085 --> 01:13:37.793
I'm gonna live!

1637
01:13:45.085 --> 01:13:46.644
Are those our wishes?
- They must be.

1638
01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:48.293
Oh, the wishes are free.

1639
01:13:49.668 --> 01:13:51.626
The wishes. She's
freeing them.

1640
01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:52.918
Our girl.

1641
01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:54.001
Come on.

1642
01:13:54.085 --> 01:13:56.335
<i>Saba,</i> you're 100 years old.

1643
01:13:56.418 --> 01:13:59.668
But my will is strong. Yeah-ha!

1644
01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:01.751
They did it!

1645
01:14:05.376 --> 01:14:07.501
No!

1646
01:14:09.501 --> 01:14:11.793
It doesn't matter.
You're too late.

1647
01:14:12.876 --> 01:14:14.043
Asha,

1648
01:14:14.126 --> 01:14:17.126
Magnifico's never too late.

1649
01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:19.126
Simon?

1650
01:14:21.126 --> 01:14:22.293
Star!

1651
01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:27.251
You really think
you can take me?

1652
01:14:30.835 --> 01:14:32.168
Thanks, John!

1653
01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:33.460
Any time, Asha!

1654
01:14:35.626 --> 01:14:37.668
Please don't hurt me.

1655
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:40.460
It's not me you
should be afraid of.

1656
01:14:45.043 --> 01:14:46.168
Boom!

1657
01:15:01.418 --> 01:15:03.918
Star! Hyah!

1658
01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:11.335
Surprise.

1659
01:15:27.043 --> 01:15:29.126
Good evening, Rosas!

1660
01:15:31.876 --> 01:15:35.918
Wow, the stars are out tonight.

1661
01:15:36.001 --> 01:15:37.835
Oh, except for you.

1662
01:15:37.918 --> 01:15:40.501
You're trapped now, aren't you?

1663
01:15:40.585 --> 01:15:43.168
But you see, what can I say?

1664
01:15:43.751 --> 01:15:46.585
I really, really don't
like being betrayed.

1665
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.330
It is you

1666
01:15:49.376 --> 01:15:50.876
who betrays your people!

1667
01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.585
Nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope.

1668
01:15:52.668 --> 01:15:53.960
I've had enough of you.

1669
01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:56.501
Your Majesty!

1670
01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:58.960
Your little trick
didn't work, Amaya.

1671
01:15:59.043 --> 01:16:01.501
I still got what I wanted.

1672
01:16:02.918 --> 01:16:04.043
What's this?

1673
01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:06.626
The wishes aren't yours to free.

1674
01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:08.376
They are mine!

1675
01:16:10.085 --> 01:16:13.001
Now, bow down to your king!

1676
01:16:15.626 --> 01:16:17.751
Star, get away from there!

1677
01:16:20.418 --> 01:16:22.251
No!

1678
01:16:22.335 --> 01:16:23.335
Asha!

1679
01:16:26.085 --> 01:16:27.626
Well, hello, Asha.

1680
01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:29.293
So glad you could join us.

1681
01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:30.501
How's the whole

1682
01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:32.543
"taking your wish
into your own hands"

1683
01:16:32.626 --> 01:16:33.751
working out for you?

1684
01:16:34.418 --> 01:16:36.418
Oh, wait.

1685
01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:38.918
I don't actually care.

1686
01:16:39.001 --> 01:16:41.001
Hello, there.

1687
01:16:41.085 --> 01:16:42.710
- Let's do this!
- Star!

1688
01:16:49.376 --> 01:16:50.460
No!

1689
01:16:54.126 --> 01:16:55.793
Yes.

1690
01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:01.960
Mirrors, mirrors on the wall,

1691
01:17:02.043 --> 01:17:03.960
who is the handsomest?

1692
01:17:04.585 --> 01:17:05.585
Me!

1693
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:07.001
No!

1694
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.126
I win.

1695
01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:12.126
Wishes really do come true.

1696
01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:14.376
You don't deserve Star!

1697
01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.585
I told you, I decide!

1698
01:17:23.543 --> 01:17:26.085
Oh! No, you don't!

1699
01:17:26.168 --> 01:17:30.293
There will be no wishing
on stars ever again!

1700
01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:37.835
In fact, there will
be no more hope,

1701
01:17:37.918 --> 01:17:39.210
no more dreams,

1702
01:17:39.293 --> 01:17:41.043
and no escape.

1703
01:17:44.085 --> 01:17:45.543
Run!

1704
01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.543
No chance to rise up.

1705
01:17:53.626 --> 01:17:56.043
No one to tell any tales.

1706
01:17:56.126 --> 01:17:59.585
No one to challenge
me ever again!

1707
01:18:01.835 --> 01:18:04.168
You... are...

1708
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:05.251
nothing!

1709
01:18:22.335 --> 01:18:24.543
We... are...

1710
01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:26.543

I'm going to make it happen.

1751

Oh, I can't wait to get started.

1752
01:21:46.918 --> 01:21:48.793
This feeling.

1753
01:21:48.876 --> 01:21:50.085
Come home.

1754
01:21:52.585 --> 01:21:53.918
There you are.

1755
01:21:56.293 --> 01:21:58.543
Oh, my beautiful wish.

1756
01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.835
Mama, you got your wish back.

1757
01:22:03.918 --> 01:22:06.626
- My baby!
- Asha!

1758
01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:08.918
I'm so happy for you.

1759
01:22:14.835 --> 01:22:16.251
Oh, this guy.

1760
01:22:17.126 --> 01:22:19.043
What do you have to
say for yourself?

1761
01:22:20.543 --> 01:22:21.626
Asha...

1762
01:22:22.626 --> 01:22:23.918
I'm sorry.

1763
01:22:24.918 --> 01:22:26.793
I'm so sorry.

1764
01:22:28.751 --> 01:22:30.543
I don't expect
you to forgive me.

1765
01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.126
I was just so scared I'd
have to live without...

1766
01:22:35.293 --> 01:22:36.460
well...

1767
01:22:37.168 --> 01:22:39.668
all of me.

1768
01:22:39.751 --> 01:22:42.251
And I wanted so badly
to believe in him.

1769
01:22:42.918 --> 01:22:44.251
So did I.

1770
01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:46.585
We all did.

1771
01:22:48.501 --> 01:22:50.710
Never trust a handsome face.

1772
01:22:50.793 --> 01:22:53.210
That's why I hang
out with you guys.

1773
01:22:53.293 --> 01:22:55.251
Aw, you get over here.

1774
01:22:56.418 --> 01:22:57.710
Hello?

1775
01:22:59.085 --> 01:23:00.543
Hello?

1776
01:23:00.626 --> 01:23:02.376
This is your King.

1777
01:23:03.335 --> 01:23:05.418
Oh, Amaya, thank goodness!

1778
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:06.861
Do you see what
they've done to me?

1779
01:23:07.126 --> 01:23:09.085
Hmm. Well, you do love mirrors.

1780
01:23:09.168 --> 01:23:11.543
That is not funny. Get
me out of here at once.

1781
01:23:11.876 --> 01:23:12.876
No.

1782
01:23:13.376 --> 01:23:14.876
What?

1783
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.293
After everything I've
done for you, for Rosas,

1784
01:23:18.376 --> 01:23:20.501
this is the thanks I get?

1785
01:23:21.001 --> 01:23:23.626
This is the thanks you deserve.

1786
01:23:24.418 --> 01:23:25.960
Hang it on the wall...

1787
01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.126
in the dungeon.

1788
01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:29.793
Please, no! The dungeon
smells really bad!

1789
01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:33.335
Long live the Queen!

1790
01:23:33.418 --> 01:23:37.001
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!

1791
01:23:37.085 --> 01:23:40.293
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!

1792
01:23:41.835 --> 01:23:43.168
We never needed Magnifico.

1793
01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.793
- Magnifico, Schmagnifico.
- Excuse us.

1794
01:23:45.876 --> 01:23:48.085
This way, this way.
She's just over here.

1795
01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:50.793
Queen Amaya, I found her!

1796
01:23:50.876 --> 01:23:52.144
Your Majesty.

1797
01:23:52.168 --> 01:23:54.085
I hear you long to fly.

1798
01:23:54.751 --> 01:23:57.418
Well, Peter here wants to
build a flying machine.

1799
01:23:57.501 --> 01:23:59.085
- Hi!
- You two should work together.

1800
01:23:59.168 --> 01:24:01.019
Let me know how I can help.

1801
01:24:01.043 --> 01:24:02.460
Hmm.

1802
01:24:05.085 --> 01:24:07.085
I'm just getting started.

1803
01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:14.918
This is more than I could
have ever dreamed possible.

1804
01:24:15.001 --> 01:24:17.335
I dream of a utopian metropolis

1805
01:24:17.418 --> 01:24:19.293
where all mammals are equal,

1806
01:24:19.376 --> 01:24:20.710
- and wear clothes!
- Oh!

1807
01:24:22.793 --> 01:24:24.085
Wait. Where'd you go?

1808
01:24:24.918 --> 01:24:26.585
Ooh. I know.

1809
01:24:26.668 --> 01:24:28.835
I'm sorry I broke it.

1810
01:24:38.293 --> 01:24:39.418
W-W-W-W-Wait,

1811
01:24:39.501 --> 01:24:41.210
is that a magic wand?

1812
01:24:41.293 --> 01:24:43.876
Okay, thank you,
but no thank you.

1813
01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.251
I am no good with magic.

1814
01:24:46.335 --> 01:24:48.460
I mean, I put a dress on a tree.

1815
01:24:48.543 --> 01:24:50.293
- I will take it for her.
- Uh-uh.

1816
01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:51.376
It's for Asha.

1817
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:52.620
Ugh!

1818
01:24:52.668 --> 01:24:54.376
But what am I supposed
to do with it?

1819
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.251
Be our fairy godmother.
I mean, what else?

1820
01:24:57.335 --> 01:25:00.751
No, I couldn't be that.

1821
01:25:06.626 --> 01:25:08.085
I could?

1822
01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.085
Thank you.

1823
01:25:20.835 --> 01:25:22.001
Okay.

1824
01:25:23.376 --> 01:25:24.501
Sorry!

1825
01:25:24.585 --> 01:25:25.668
Clara!

1826
01:25:25.751 --> 01:25:27.168
And you wonder

1827
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:28.710
why I'm grumpy!

1828
01:25:28.793 --> 01:25:30.269
I'm sure she'll work on it

1829
01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:31.418
with Star, right?

1830
01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.335
Oh, no.

1831
01:25:37.418 --> 01:25:38.751
I know you too well now.

1832
01:25:39.293 --> 01:25:41.210
You're going soon, aren't you?

1833
01:25:42.001 --> 01:25:43.876
So you can be there for
others to wish upon.

1834
01:25:46.668 --> 01:25:49.835
I will miss you.

1835
01:25:49.918 --> 01:25:52.918
Oh, my voice is really
high when I cry.

1836
01:25:53.001 --> 01:25:55.126
Aw, Valentino.

1837
01:25:55.626 --> 01:25:57.293
Well, soon doesn't mean tonight.

1838
01:25:57.376 --> 01:25:59.876
Oh, thank goodness!

1839
01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.210
That was just too much for me.

1840
01:26:02.293 --> 01:26:04.543
I am only three
weeks old, after all.

1841
01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:08.168
Oh, Star, how can
we ever thank you?

1842
01:26:10.585 --> 01:26:11.835
That's easy.

1843
01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:14.251
