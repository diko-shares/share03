NARRATOR: <i>Once upon a
time, there was a young man</i>

more important than a wish.</i>

you who you are.</i>

how impossible it can be</i>

8
00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:26.043
<i>to make that wish come true.</i>

9
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:29.751
<i>How easily dreams
can be destroyed.</i>

10

{\an8}<i>He studied the magic
of the world tirelessly</i>

12

17
00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:52.126
<i>The sorcerer didn't know if
the world would want his gift.</i>

18
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:57.543

found the most perfect island</i>

20
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.168
