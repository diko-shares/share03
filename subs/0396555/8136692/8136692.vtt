1
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.459
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

2
00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.099
so I choosed another scary one

3
00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.099
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

4
00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.859
I wasn't scary at all.

5
00:02:37.418 --> 00:02:41.457
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

6
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.457
I don't really care about winning.

7
00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:47.857
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

8
00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:49.817
I've gotten tired of it.

9
00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:53.299
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

10
00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:55.737
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

11
00:02:55.857 --> 00:02:59.776
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

12
00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.415
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

13
00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:03.817
Not the lazy game.

14
00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:13.136
They're here.

15
00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:19.815
Lewis?

16
00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:22.934
Lewis?

17
00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:34.054
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

18
00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:35.695
They are gonna love this!

19
00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:38.574
Nothing says "adopt me"
like a weird invention.

20
00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:39.774
Lewis!

21
00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:41.933
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
- Way ahead of you, Mildred.

22
00:03:42.053 --> 00:03:43.773
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:46.852
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

24
00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:49.051
Smile. Let's fix your...

25
00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:51.012
Mildred.

26
00:03:51.412 --> 00:03:53.373
All right, all right, all right, all right.

27
00:03:53.493 --> 00:03:55.292
Go show them how special you are.

28
00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:57.252
Oh, I hope this is it.

29
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.012
I hope he gets adopted.

30
00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:00.692
You and me both, chief.

31
00:04:02.252 --> 00:04:04.973
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

32
00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:08.292
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

33
00:04:08.412 --> 00:04:09.891
The possibilities are endless.

34
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:12.010
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

35
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.852
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

36
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.251
and we can make the world
a better place.

37
00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:20.531
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

38
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:22.570
So, what's your favourite sport?

39
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.090
- Well, does inventing count as a sport?
- Actually...

40
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.210
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

41
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.650
- What is that?
- First, a question.

42
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:31.969
What's the number one problem
that you face

43
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.730
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

44
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.049
- Lewis, I don't think we...
- Portion control.

45
00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.008
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

46
00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:39.168
takes forever to chew.

47
00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.889
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

48
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.529
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

49
00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:46.928
is within mankind's grasp,

50
00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:49.247
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

51
00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:51.489
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

52
00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:52.647
Honey, it's okay.

53
00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:54.528
As you can see, toasting is an option.

54
00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.729
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

55
00:04:57.287 --> 00:04:59.607
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

56
00:04:59.727 --> 00:05:01.405
It's jammed!

57
00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:04.887
Lewis, please, don't!

58
00:05:13.528 --> 00:05:14.567
What's happening?

59
00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:17.406
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

60
00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:19.165
I'm sorry!

61
00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:20.766
Here let me help you get that off!

62
00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:22.567
Stand back!

63
00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:28.126
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Breathe. Breathe.

64
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.126
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

65
00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.806
It was really nice to meet you.

66
00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:34.606
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

67
00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:36.804
Hi, folks. Everything all...

68
00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:37.965
What happened?

69
00:05:38.086 --> 00:05:40.445
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

70
00:05:40.563 --> 00:05:41.924
Now, if you'll excuse me.

71
00:05:42.044 --> 00:05:45.844
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

72
00:05:54.163 --> 00:05:56.723
- I made some lunch.
- Not hungry.

73
00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:00.082
Poor Mr Harrington.

74
00:06:00.203 --> 00:06:03.603
- I killed him?
- No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

75
00:06:03.724 --> 00:06:05.602
I called. He's perfectly fine.

76
00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:08.921
I was just gonna say that it's...

77
00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:10.642
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

78
00:06:10.762 --> 00:06:13.201
from that wonderful invention of yours.

79
00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:15.322
- Yeah, real wonderful.
- It's not you.

80
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.842
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

81
00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:19.802
One hundred twenty-four.

82
00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:21.322
What?

83
00:06:21.442 --> 00:06:24.802
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

84
00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:25.962
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

85
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:28.241
You're exaggerating just to make your

86
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.880
point.

87
00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:32.920
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

88
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:36.401
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

89
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.921
I have no future. No one wants me.

90
00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.040
That's not true, Lewis!

91
00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.760
My own mother didn't even want me.

92
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.161
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

93
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.599
Then why'd she give me up?

94
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.321
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

95
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.880
Did you ever think of that?

96
00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:54.600
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

97
00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.639
I never thought of it that way.

98
00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.919
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

99
00:07:01.158 --> 00:07:02.678
You're right.

100
00:07:02.997 --> 00:07:06.318
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

101
00:07:06.438 --> 00:07:08.120
Wait. I said "maybe."

102
00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:10.917
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

103
00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:12.438
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:15.798
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

105
00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:17.236
and we'll be a family again!

106
00:07:17.356 --> 00:07:20.996
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

107
00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:23.756
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

108
00:07:25.037 --> 00:07:27.477
Wrong. I saw her

109
00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:28.636
once.

110
00:07:28.995 --> 00:07:32.238
She's in here. I just have to remember.

111
00:07:36.117 --> 00:07:37.117
That's it!

112
00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:41.756
Hello

113
00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:44.594
I got something to tell you

114
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:48.035
But it's crazy

115
00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:51.475
I got something to show you

116
00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:54.875
So give me just one more chance

117
00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:58.954
One more glance
And I will make of you

118
00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:02.434
Another believer

119
00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:07.434
Guess what?
You got more than you bargained

120
00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:10.473
Ain't it crazy?

121
00:08:10.593 --> 00:08:14.074
You got more than you paid for

122
00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:17.353
So give me just one more chance

123
00:08:17.473 --> 00:08:19.952
One more glance

124
00:08:20.073 --> 00:08:24.831
One more hand to hold

125
00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:31.551
You've been on my mind

126
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:35.032
Though it may seem I'm fooling

127
00:08:35.152 --> 00:08:41.431
Wasted so much time

128
00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:45.951
Though it may seem I'm fooling

129
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.351
What are we gonna do?

130
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.070
What are we gonna do?

131
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.910
What are we gonna do about it?

132
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:01.429
You've been on my mind

133
00:09:01.549 --> 00:09:04.829
One more chance

134
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:09.949
Wasted so much time

135
00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:14.229
One more chance

136
00:09:16.068 --> 00:09:17.389
So tired.

137
00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:22.548
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

138
00:09:22.668 --> 00:09:23.907
Bye-bye, now.

139
00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:27.466
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

140
00:09:27.586 --> 00:09:29.546
- Good luck at the big game today.
- Easy win.

141
00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:31.628
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

142
00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.747
I just hope I can stay awake.

143
00:09:33.867 --> 00:09:35.666
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

144
00:09:35.787 --> 00:09:39.387
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

145
00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:41.145
but that's what happens

146
00:09:41.266 --> 00:09:44.386
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

147
00:09:50.706 --> 00:09:52.345
Ah, that's good joe.

148
00:09:53.745 --> 00:09:56.546
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

149
00:09:56.667 --> 00:09:59.547
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

150
00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:02.625
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

151
00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:05.306
Now the neural circuits will connect.

152
00:10:05.424 --> 00:10:07.226
I've cracked the hippocampus!

153
00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:09.144
Really? Okay. What?

154
00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:10.983
Now to test it out.

155
00:10:12.824 --> 00:10:15.623
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

156
00:10:15.743 --> 00:10:16.783
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

157
00:10:16.904 --> 00:10:18.503
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

158
00:10:18.624 --> 00:10:19.944
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

159
00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:22.263
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

160
00:10:22.384 --> 00:10:24.184
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks"?

161
00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:26.104
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

162
00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:29.104
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

163
00:10:29.223 --> 00:10:32.863
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

164
00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:35.182
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

165
00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:38.862
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

166
00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:40.821
I am, and this is it.

167
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.102
This is my future.

168
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:44.581
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:46.982
Lewis? Honey?

170
00:10:51.221 --> 00:10:53.782
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

171
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:54.942
at Inventco Labs,

172
00:10:55.061 --> 00:10:56.942
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

173
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.901
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

174
00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:00.980
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

175
00:11:01.102 --> 00:11:03.059
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

176
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.541
Oh, wait! I said that already.

177
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.380
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

178
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.420
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

179
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.421
I haven't slept in eight days!

180
00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:13.141
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

181
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:16.140
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

182
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.778
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

183
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.219
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

184
00:11:22.338 --> 00:11:23.338
Sorry. Who's this?

185
00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:25.979
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

186
00:11:26.538 --> 00:11:27.659
Oh, so cute!

187
00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:30.058
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

188
00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:34.298
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

189
00:11:34.418 --> 00:11:36.858
It's actually a toga, sir.

190
00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:40.298
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

191
00:11:40.417 --> 00:11:42.777
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

192
00:11:42.898 --> 00:11:45.777
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

193
00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:47.097
It's my gym.

194
00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:49.576
Stanley. Volcano.

195
00:11:49.697 --> 00:11:54.976
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

196
00:11:57.655 --> 00:12:00.897
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

197
00:12:01.016 --> 00:12:02.057
Dr Krunklehorn?

198
00:12:02.176 --> 00:12:04.097
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

199
00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:08.016
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

200
00:12:08.137 --> 00:12:09.777
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

201
00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.335
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

202
00:12:11.454 --> 00:12:13.095
- Coach!
- I'm watching you.

203
00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:25.095
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

204
00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:26.336
That's right.

205
00:12:26.456 --> 00:12:27.853
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

206
00:12:27.975 --> 00:12:29.735
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

207
00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:32.014
Only my enemies.

208
00:12:33.134 --> 00:12:35.254
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

209
00:12:35.374 --> 00:12:38.012
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

210
00:12:51.172 --> 00:12:53.012
This area's not secure. Get in.

211
00:12:53.492 --> 00:12:56.611
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

212
00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:58.852
- What?
- Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

213
00:12:58.972 --> 00:13:01.370
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right,

214
00:13:01.492 --> 00:13:03.450
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

215
00:13:03.571 --> 00:13:05.651
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

216
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:07.730
- The what?
- Time Continuum Task Force.

217
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.930
- I'm here to protect you.
- Well...

218
00:13:09.049 --> 00:13:11.372
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

219
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:12.532
No, why?

220
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.931
I could lose my badge for this.

221
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.691
He's a suspect in a robbery.

222
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:17.851
What did he steal?

223
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:19.212
- A time machine.
- A what?

224
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.330
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

225
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:24.050
Me? Why me?

226
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.050
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

227
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.048
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."

228
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.449
I know what HQ means.

229
00:13:29.568 --> 00:13:31.048
Good. You're a smart kid.

230
00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:33.128
That might keep you alive, for now.

231
00:13:33.248 --> 00:13:34.729
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

232
00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:36.889
and leave the "perp" to me.

233
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.651
- And by "perp," I mean...
- I know what it means!

234
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:41.689
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

235
00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:47.168
Bowler Hat Guy!

236
00:13:50.648 --> 00:13:51.928
My frogs!

237
00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:53.247
You're not gonna get away with it,

238
00:13:54.128 --> 00:13:56.888
kid with science project.

239
00:13:57.008 --> 00:13:59.528
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

240
00:14:00.808 --> 00:14:03.168
My frogs! They're getting away!

241
00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:35.325
Got you! That's the last of them.

242
00:14:35.445 --> 00:14:37.684
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

243
00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:38.845
I'm on a very important...

244
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:42.043
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

245
00:14:42.164 --> 00:14:45.083
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

246
00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:46.283
Coach...

247
00:14:46.403 --> 00:14:47.483
Next up is Lewis.

248
00:14:47.603 --> 00:14:49.684
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

249
00:14:50.204 --> 00:14:52.083
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

250
00:14:52.843 --> 00:14:56.603
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

251
00:14:56.723 --> 00:14:59.522
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

252
00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:02.842
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

253
00:15:07.082 --> 00:15:08.921
Okay, stand back, everybody.

254
00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.600
This next project
will knock your socks off.

255
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:14.321
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

256
00:15:15.962 --> 00:15:17.441
Have you ever forgotten something,

257
00:15:17.561 --> 00:15:20.921
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

258
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.800
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

259
00:15:24.961 --> 00:15:28.242
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

260
00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:30.840
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

261
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.760
I call it the Memory Scanner.

262
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.921
It's shiny!

263
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.601
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

264
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.958
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

265
00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:46.239
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

266
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.718
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

267
00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:50.680
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

268
00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:54.240
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

269
00:15:54.358 --> 00:15:56.159
Why that particular day?

270
00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:58.158
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

271
00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:01.798
Well, that was the day...

272
00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:05.758
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

273
00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:07.358
Fair enough. Play ball.

274
00:16:08.397 --> 00:16:10.877
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

275
00:16:28.436 --> 00:16:30.235
Lewis, wait!

276
00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:42.516
She's gonna blow!

277
00:16:44.115 --> 00:16:45.515
Watch out!

278
00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:51.355
Feel the pain! Love the...

279
00:16:51.475 --> 00:16:53.435
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

280
00:16:59.114 --> 00:17:00.314
Make it stop!

281
00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:01.713
Coach, suck it up, okay?

282
00:17:01.834 --> 00:17:05.113
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

283
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.953
- Let's calm down!
- Mr Willerstein?

284
00:17:07.073 --> 00:17:08.592
- I didn't mean to...
- Not now, Lewis!

285
00:17:08.712 --> 00:17:11.233
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

286
00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:12.792
Not now.

287
00:17:13.954 --> 00:17:16.792
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

288
00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:17.953
toward the exits.

289
00:17:22.352 --> 00:17:23.752
Wait, Lewis!

290
00:17:41.472 --> 00:17:44.350
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

291
00:19:02.345 --> 00:19:04.825
Hey, what are you doing up here?

292
00:19:19.223 --> 00:19:21.823
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

293
00:19:22.623 --> 00:19:24.262
You're blowing my cover.

294
00:19:24.382 --> 00:19:25.902
We're the only ones up here.

295
00:19:26.022 --> 00:19:27.903
That's just what they want you to think.

296
00:19:28.022 --> 00:19:29.543
Now, enough moping.

297
00:19:29.662 --> 00:19:32.462
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

298
00:19:32.582 --> 00:19:34.380
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

299
00:19:34.502 --> 00:19:35.500
Maybe you've forgotten.

300
00:19:35.621 --> 00:19:38.060
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

301
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:40.221
That's no badge.

302
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:43.502
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

303
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:45.581
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

304
00:19:45.702 --> 00:19:47.582
but I really am from the future,

305
00:19:47.701 --> 00:19:49.580
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

306
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:50.861
Here we go again.

307
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.821
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

308
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:53.981
and ruined your project.

309
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.300
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

310
00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.820
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

311
00:19:58.939 --> 00:20:00.459
and you're not from the future!

312
00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:01.579
You're crazy!

313
00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:03.418
I am not crazy.

314
00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:05.780
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

315
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.099
Yeah, that's what I thought.

316
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.940
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

317
00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:13.899
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

318
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.218
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

319
00:20:17.338 --> 00:20:19.459
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

320
00:20:19.938 --> 00:20:21.417
Hey, let go of me!

321
00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:23.498
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Okay.

322
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.976
What is this? Where are we going?

323
00:20:45.376 --> 00:20:47.336
To the future!

324
00:21:06.854 --> 00:21:09.054
The future has arrived

325
00:21:10.174 --> 00:21:12.655
The future has arrived today

326
00:21:13.254 --> 00:21:15.016
The future has arrived

327
00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:18.735
The future has arrived today

328
00:21:58.491 --> 00:21:59.410
Is this proof enough for you?

329
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.050
Is it ever!

330
00:22:01.171 --> 00:22:04.050
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

331
00:22:04.169 --> 00:22:06.491
and here it is, right in front of me!

332
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.290
The truth will set you free, brother.

333
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.171
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

334
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.049
This means
I could really change my life.

335
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.490
That's right. You can.

336
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.849
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

337
00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:20.609
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

338
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.129
- What?
- Wilbur, this is a time machine!

339
00:22:24.249 --> 00:22:25.888
Why should I fix my dumb invention

340
00:22:26.009 --> 00:22:29.288
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

341
00:22:30.931 --> 00:22:34.850
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

342
00:22:34.968 --> 00:22:37.688
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

343
00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:40.049
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

344
00:22:40.169 --> 00:22:41.248
What are you doing?

345
00:22:41.369 --> 00:22:42.489
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

346
00:22:42.609 --> 00:22:44.367
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

347
00:22:44.487 --> 00:22:46.207
- Lewis, no!
- Let go!

348
00:22:46.327 --> 00:22:48.127
- You let go!
- You're not the boss of me!

349
00:22:48.248 --> 00:22:51.287
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

350
00:22:51.408 --> 00:22:52.727
That makes me older.

351
00:22:52.845 --> 00:22:53.885
Well, I was born in the past,

352
00:22:54.008 --> 00:22:55.968
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

353
00:23:13.164 --> 00:23:15.164
I am so dead.

354
00:23:16.804 --> 00:23:19.285
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

355
00:23:19.405 --> 00:23:20.726
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

356
00:23:20.846 --> 00:23:23.484
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

357
00:23:23.605 --> 00:23:25.204
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

358
00:23:25.323 --> 00:23:26.325
- or something?
- No!

359
00:23:26.445 --> 00:23:28.443
There's only two time machines
in existence,

360
00:23:28.565 --> 00:23:30.284
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

361
00:23:30.404 --> 00:23:32.766
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

362
00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:35.804
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

363
00:23:35.924 --> 00:23:38.244
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

364
00:23:38.364 --> 00:23:40.804
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

365
00:23:42.084 --> 00:23:43.964
All right, under one condition.

366
00:23:44.324 --> 00:23:46.923
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

367
00:23:47.043 --> 00:23:49.844
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

368
00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:51.004
How can I trust you?

369
00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:53.722
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

370
00:23:53.842 --> 00:23:55.482
How can I trust you?

371
00:23:56.082 --> 00:23:57.242
Touché.

372
00:23:59.041 --> 00:24:00.762
So do we have a deal?

373
00:24:31.321 --> 00:24:32.559
Good day, madam.

374
00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:36.000
- I'm here to change the future.
- Yes, sir?

375
00:24:36.118 --> 00:24:39.799
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

376
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.039
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with destiny.

377
00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:44.758
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

378
00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:47.000
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

379
00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:49.080
- What?
- Now, what time is your appointment?

380
00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:52.918
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

381
00:24:53.118 --> 00:24:54.638
What time is your appointment?

382
00:24:57.598 --> 00:24:59.878
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

383
00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:01.557
You're the 2:00?

384
00:25:02.237 --> 00:25:03.637
Yes. Yes, I am.

385
00:25:03.758 --> 00:25:05.437
You're Mary Johnson?

386
00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:07.796
Yes.

387
00:25:08.317 --> 00:25:10.437
Mary is short for...

388
00:25:11.437 --> 00:25:12.436
Marian?

389
00:25:13.277 --> 00:25:15.316
- Can that be a boy name?
- Yes.

390
00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:17.834
- Then yes.
- Have a seat.

391
00:25:17.956 --> 00:25:19.276
Oh, goody!

392
00:25:27.795 --> 00:25:33.395
"Pass off invention as my own." Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

393
00:25:33.515 --> 00:25:35.074
The board is ready to see you now.

394
00:25:36.074 --> 00:25:38.395
Wait. What am I going to say?

395
00:25:39.394 --> 00:25:41.273
I'm never gonna remember that.

396
00:25:41.514 --> 00:25:44.635
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

397
00:25:45.753 --> 00:25:46.873
That's true.

398
00:25:46.993 --> 00:25:49.555
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

399
00:25:49.674 --> 00:25:50.714
as its own.

400
00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:55.873
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

401
00:26:01.273 --> 00:26:05.233
"Prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!

402
00:26:06.072 --> 00:26:09.073
Prepare to be amazed!

403
00:26:09.794 --> 00:26:14.032
"This is my invention."

404
00:26:14.033 --> 00:26:18.031
"I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device."

405
00:26:18.152 --> 00:26:19.152
Very well,

406
00:26:19.712 --> 00:26:21.392
Miss Johnson?

407
00:26:21.991 --> 00:26:23.351
It's Ms.

408
00:26:23.472 --> 00:26:25.952
You have two minutes. Please begin.

409
00:26:30.431 --> 00:26:32.670
- It's shiny!
- What is that thing?

410
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:37.150
Well, I like to call it my...

411
00:26:37.151 --> 00:26:39.071
To call it my...

412
00:26:39.191 --> 00:26:43.190
- What are you looking at?
- No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

413
00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:45.030
Well, then let me close the blinds.

414
00:26:50.429 --> 00:26:52.428
Now, the name?

415
00:26:52.988 --> 00:26:54.428
Well, what...

416
00:26:54.548 --> 00:26:56.148
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

417
00:26:56.268 --> 00:26:58.910
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

418
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.229
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

419
00:27:02.348 --> 00:27:06.069
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

420
00:27:10.429 --> 00:27:13.147
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

421
00:27:13.268 --> 00:27:14.987
Yes, thank you.

422
00:27:15.107 --> 00:27:17.627
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

423
00:27:17.946 --> 00:27:20.067
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

424
00:27:20.187 --> 00:27:21.748
Oh, nothing of consequence.

425
00:27:21.868 --> 00:27:26.427
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

426
00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:29.907
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

427
00:27:30.026 --> 00:27:31.666
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

428
00:27:32.667 --> 00:27:33.866
Thirty seconds.

429
00:27:38.505 --> 00:27:39.986
Allow me to show you how it works.

430
00:27:40.104 --> 00:27:42.065
First, we turn it on.

431
00:27:44.784 --> 00:27:46.824
That's not it.

432
00:27:48.626 --> 00:27:49.665
Ten seconds.

433
00:28:07.943 --> 00:28:09.904
So where do I sign?

434
00:28:20.266 --> 00:28:22.666
Doris, it's all over.

435
00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:24.665
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

436
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:28.346
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

437
00:28:28.985 --> 00:28:30.225
You're right.

438
00:28:30.345 --> 00:28:33.943
Success is still ours for the taking.

439
00:28:35.985 --> 00:28:38.105
We must find that boy.

440
00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:45.303
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

441
00:28:45.424 --> 00:28:46.422
What about your parents?

442
00:28:46.543 --> 00:28:47.623
Mom never goes in there,

443
00:28:47.742 --> 00:28:49.742
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

444
00:28:49.863 --> 00:28:50.861
You've got till then to fix it.

445
00:28:50.983 --> 00:28:54.022
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

446
00:28:54.143 --> 00:28:56.383
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

447
00:28:59.103 --> 00:29:02.102
Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?

448
00:29:02.222 --> 00:29:04.183
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

449
00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:07.342
None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.

450
00:29:07.462 --> 00:29:09.783
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

451
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:13.062
Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.

452
00:29:13.182 --> 00:29:15.221
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

453
00:29:15.342 --> 00:29:16.621
You...

454
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.301
Good point.

455
00:29:21.341 --> 00:29:23.221
Welcome back, little buddy.

456
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.781
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

457
00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:28.341
Did you find it? Apparently not,

458
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.981
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

459
00:29:31.101 --> 00:29:32.580
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

460
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.140
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

461
00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:37.219
- Who's that?
- Wow, a real robot!

462
00:29:37.339 --> 00:29:38.419
Hi, I'm Lewis.

463
00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:46.579
Well, that was unexpected.

464
00:29:47.139 --> 00:29:48.659
As was that.

465
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.179
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

466
00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:53.299
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

467
00:29:53.419 --> 00:29:56.338
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

468
00:29:56.457 --> 00:29:58.578
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

469
00:29:58.698 --> 00:30:00.338
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

470
00:30:00.457 --> 00:30:02.098
That is an excellent question.

471
00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:03.617
Wait! Where are you going?

472
00:30:03.737 --> 00:30:05.136
Another excellent question.

473
00:30:06.737 --> 00:30:08.457
But I don't just want to sit here.

474
00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:09.937
Stay.

475
00:30:10.217 --> 00:30:11.217
But...

476
00:30:25.977 --> 00:30:27.456
Wow!

477
00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:34.576
Hey, ring my doorbell.

478
00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:36.016
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

479
00:30:36.137 --> 00:30:38.136
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

480
00:30:39.815 --> 00:30:42.095
- Yes!
- That was accidental.

481
00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:43.615
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

482
00:30:43.736 --> 00:30:44.815
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

483
00:30:44.935 --> 00:30:46.335
- Flat head.
- Short roots.

484
00:30:46.454 --> 00:30:47.455
Evergreen.

485
00:30:53.173 --> 00:30:54.653
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

486
00:30:54.773 --> 00:30:58.333
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

487
00:30:58.453 --> 00:31:01.973
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

488
00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:04.852
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

489
00:31:04.974 --> 00:31:06.573
That and someone took my bike.

490
00:31:06.692 --> 00:31:09.293
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

491
00:31:09.532 --> 00:31:12.053
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

492
00:31:12.172 --> 00:31:14.011
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

493
00:31:14.132 --> 00:31:15.531
Then he fixes the time machine.

494
00:31:15.651 --> 00:31:17.331
Why is it an acorn?

495
00:31:17.451 --> 00:31:19.091
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

496
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:21.132
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

497
00:31:21.252 --> 00:31:22.771
His confidence in inventing is restored.

498
00:31:22.892 --> 00:31:25.251
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

499
00:31:25.371 --> 00:31:27.211
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

500
00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:29.013
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

501
00:31:29.131 --> 00:31:30.891
I just told him that to buy some time.

502
00:31:31.011 --> 00:31:34.212
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

503
00:31:34.332 --> 00:31:36.011
Trust me. I got it under control.

504
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:38.130
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

505
00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:41.970
But on the slight chance that I do...

506
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:45.130
"On the slight chance," yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

507
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:49.931
What is it?

508
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:51.690
Well, it's not...

509
00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:56.688
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

510
00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:01.450
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

511
00:32:01.809 --> 00:32:04.808
- What?
- And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

512
00:32:04.928 --> 00:32:06.249
I won't exist?

513
00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:07.808
And where does that leave me?

514
00:32:07.927 --> 00:32:10.127
Alone, rusting in a corner.

515
00:32:12.207 --> 00:32:14.888
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

516
00:32:17.887 --> 00:32:21.688
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

517
00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:23.047
and get some quiet time.

518
00:32:26.406 --> 00:32:27.406
What's...

519
00:32:28.127 --> 00:32:29.685
Well, hey, there, little fella!

520
00:32:29.806 --> 00:32:33.366
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

521
00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:34.967
My head is!

522
00:32:36.364 --> 00:32:39.085
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

523
00:32:40.045 --> 00:32:41.605
They didn't laugh, either.

524
00:32:41.725 --> 00:32:43.687
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

525
00:32:43.806 --> 00:32:45.766
- Well, Lewis, but...
- Lewis, huh?

526
00:32:45.885 --> 00:32:48.845
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

527
00:32:48.965 --> 00:32:50.525
- Teeth?
- Yeah, my teeth.

528
00:32:51.246 --> 00:32:54.085
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

529
00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:56.245
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

530
00:32:56.364 --> 00:32:57.404
Wilbur left me down there,

531
00:32:57.525 --> 00:32:58.764
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

532
00:32:58.883 --> 00:32:59.883
- Monsters?
... attacked me on the porch and...

533
00:33:00.004 --> 00:33:01.805
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

534
00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:03.405
- Listen to me!
- Of course, I also didn't think

535
00:33:03.524 --> 00:33:05.084
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

536
00:33:05.205 --> 00:33:06.603
and lookie there!

537
00:33:06.723 --> 00:33:07.723
Hope he ain't got rabies.

538
00:33:07.843 --> 00:33:09.924
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

539
00:33:10.043 --> 00:33:13.764
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

540
00:33:13.883 --> 00:33:15.763
Welcome to the garage.

541
00:33:16.683 --> 00:33:17.842
Well, I'm completely lost.

542
00:33:17.963 --> 00:33:19.003
Hiya, Grandpa.

543
00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:20.161
Hey, Aunt Billie.

544
00:33:20.282 --> 00:33:21.763
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

545
00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:24.042
- We have a garage?
- Apparently so.

546
00:33:24.163 --> 00:33:26.403
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

547
00:33:26.524 --> 00:33:30.242
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

548
00:33:31.722 --> 00:33:33.441
That's a toy train?

549
00:33:35.322 --> 00:33:39.279
On your mark, get set, go?

550
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.081
- 3.7 seconds.
- I win!

551
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:48.560
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

552
00:33:49.801 --> 00:33:50.881
Lewis?

553
00:33:51.121 --> 00:33:53.881
- And five and six and seven and eight.
- That's Uncle Joe. He works out.

554
00:33:54.002 --> 00:33:55.000
Keep those tummies tucked.

555
00:33:56.681 --> 00:33:58.081
This isn't the garage.

556
00:33:58.201 --> 00:33:59.201
I know.

557
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.599
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

558
00:34:01.719 --> 00:34:04.280
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

559
00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.839
- That's Uncle Art.
- A real superhero?

560
00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:08.800
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

561
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.118
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

562
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.480
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

563
00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.160
- He's a...
- Pizza delivery guy.

564
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.558
Lewis?

565
00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:21.558
- What are we doing up here?
- Looking for the garage.

566
00:34:21.678 --> 00:34:23.318
Oh, yeah!

567
00:34:29.956 --> 00:34:33.557
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

568
00:34:33.677 --> 00:34:35.878
- Lighten up, sis!
- Lasz, I mean it!

569
00:34:36.196 --> 00:34:39.196
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

570
00:34:39.317 --> 00:34:41.198
What is all the yelling out here?

571
00:34:41.317 --> 00:34:42.436
- He started it!
- She started it!

572
00:34:42.557 --> 00:34:43.837
I don't want to hear any more!

573
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:47.276
- Now, sweetie...
- Don't you "sweetie" me!

574
00:34:47.636 --> 00:34:49.596
I'm going for a drive!

575
00:34:53.117 --> 00:34:55.555
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

576
00:34:55.714 --> 00:34:57.395
Lewis!

577
00:34:57.516 --> 00:35:00.074
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

578
00:35:01.555 --> 00:35:03.636
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

579
00:35:03.756 --> 00:35:05.035
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

580
00:35:05.157 --> 00:35:08.115
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

581
00:35:08.235 --> 00:35:10.835
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

582
00:35:11.996 --> 00:35:14.235
- Oh, look, there's...
- That's the monster!

583
00:35:14.354 --> 00:35:17.114
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

584
00:35:18.314 --> 00:35:19.593
Nice to meet you.

585
00:35:19.713 --> 00:35:21.914
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

586
00:35:22.993 --> 00:35:25.273
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

587
00:35:25.393 --> 00:35:27.394
- Who?
- Wilbur's mom, Franny.

588
00:35:27.514 --> 00:35:29.112
I think you'll like her.

589
00:35:33.153 --> 00:35:34.473
Hey, guys!

590
00:35:34.752 --> 00:35:38.832
You ask me over
And over and over

591
00:35:38.953 --> 00:35:41.913
Have you seen
My peacock-feathered hat?

592
00:35:42.032 --> 00:35:43.151
Frogs?

593
00:35:43.272 --> 00:35:44.712
Taught them everything they know.

594
00:35:44.831 --> 00:35:47.672
- Franny, this is Lewis.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

595
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:51.190
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

596
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.472
Where is your heart at?
Nobody knows that

597
00:35:55.592 --> 00:35:57.591
Even though you've him, her, me

598
00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.191
And an army searching

599
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.669
I've got a feeling
You will be reeling

600
00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:09.230
When you are bad
And the circus comes to town

601
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.989
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

602
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.830
And you see me leaving
Dressed up as a magician

603
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.029
Or something like that

604
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.230
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

605
00:36:18.431 --> 00:36:19.710
Ring-a-ding-ding.

606
00:36:25.389 --> 00:36:26.428
All right!

607
00:36:26.549 --> 00:36:29.550
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

608
00:36:29.669 --> 00:36:31.988
but, wow, look at the time.

609
00:36:34.228 --> 00:36:36.308
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

610
00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:38.468
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

611
00:36:39.508 --> 00:36:40.988
You met my family?

612
00:36:43.788 --> 00:36:44.827
Pop quiz.

613
00:36:44.948 --> 00:36:46.348
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

614
00:36:46.468 --> 00:36:48.388
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

615
00:36:48.507 --> 00:36:50.786
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

616
00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:52.067
Cranky? Yes.

617
00:36:52.186 --> 00:36:53.546
Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.

618
00:36:53.666 --> 00:36:55.546
Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.

619
00:36:55.666 --> 00:36:56.746
Spike and Dimitri are twins,

620
00:36:56.866 --> 00:36:58.586
and I don't know who they're related to.

621
00:36:58.706 --> 00:36:59.745
Neither do we. Go on.

622
00:36:59.866 --> 00:37:03.145
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

623
00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:05.666
What does Cornelius look like?

624
00:37:05.667 --> 00:37:07.026
Tom Selleck.

625
00:37:08.305 --> 00:37:12.026
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

626
00:37:12.145 --> 00:37:13.305
You're forgetting something.

627
00:37:13.426 --> 00:37:14.584
Forgetting? Oh, right.

628
00:37:14.705 --> 00:37:17.065
Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.

629
00:37:17.184 --> 00:37:18.746
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

630
00:37:18.865 --> 00:37:19.866
Nope.

631
00:37:20.344 --> 00:37:21.424
Thank you. Thank you.

632
00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:24.824
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

633
00:37:36.824 --> 00:37:39.424
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

634
00:37:45.943 --> 00:37:47.623
I've got you now.

635
00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:49.103
Lewis!

636
00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:54.583
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

637
00:37:54.702 --> 00:37:57.942
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

638
00:37:58.063 --> 00:38:01.462
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me "puke face"

639
00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:04.182
and "butterfingers"
and "booger breath."

640
00:38:04.301 --> 00:38:07.101
Nice to see that they're branching out.

641
00:38:07.221 --> 00:38:09.660
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

642
00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.780
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

643
00:38:11.899 --> 00:38:14.741
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

644
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.861
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

645
00:38:18.461 --> 00:38:21.140
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

646
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.020
Game didn't go so well, huh?

647
00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:29.460
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

648
00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:31.300
Then I got beat up.

649
00:38:31.421 --> 00:38:35.458
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

650
00:38:35.698 --> 00:38:37.539
I don't know. He's probably right.

651
00:38:37.658 --> 00:38:38.739
No!

652
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:41.739
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

653
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.738
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

654
00:38:45.858 --> 00:38:47.619
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

655
00:38:47.738 --> 00:38:49.299
Let them fuel your actions.

656
00:38:49.418 --> 00:38:51.379
Let hate be your ally,

657
00:38:51.498 --> 00:38:55.059
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

658
00:38:56.619 --> 00:39:01.136
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

659
00:39:04.378 --> 00:39:05.457
What?

660
00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.457
Where is that boy?

661
00:39:15.416 --> 00:39:18.617
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

662
00:39:22.614 --> 00:39:25.615
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

663
00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:27.894
Now, what did you find?

664
00:39:29.974 --> 00:39:31.575
Yes. Yes, I see.

665
00:39:31.695 --> 00:39:34.694
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

666
00:39:34.814 --> 00:39:38.016
That plus my stick must mean...

667
00:39:47.814 --> 00:39:50.733
To the future! Shotgun!

668
00:39:58.733 --> 00:39:59.693
I don't even know what I'm doing.

669
00:39:59.812 --> 00:40:00.812
Keep moving forward.

670
00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:02.892
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

671
00:40:03.013 --> 00:40:04.053
Keep moving forward.

672
00:40:04.173 --> 00:40:06.173
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

673
00:40:06.292 --> 00:40:07.372
Keep moving forward.

674
00:40:07.733 --> 00:40:08.932
Why do you keep saying that?

675
00:40:09.052 --> 00:40:10.932
And don't just say,
"Keep moving forward."

676
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:12.331
It's my dad's motto.

677
00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:14.331
Why would his motto be
"keep moving forward"?

678
00:40:14.451 --> 00:40:15.731
It's what he does.

679
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.451
What's that supposed to mean?

680
00:40:17.571 --> 00:40:19.372
That is an excellent question.

681
00:40:19.572 --> 00:40:20.813
Robinson Industries,

682
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:23.531
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

683
00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:26.331
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

684
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:30.450
His motto, "Keep moving forward."
It's what he does.

685
00:40:30.451 --> 00:40:32.210
- What has he invented?
- Everything.

686
00:40:32.331 --> 00:40:34.131
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

687
00:40:34.251 --> 00:40:36.889
Your dad invented the time machine?

688
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.409
Yep. Five years ago,

689
00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:40.609
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

690
00:40:40.729 --> 00:40:43.529
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

691
00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:45.970
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

692
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.690
We're talking prototypes.

693
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.130
That's a prototype?

694
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:52.329
- The very first, or what's left of it.
- Yikes.

695
00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:54.569
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

696
00:40:54.688 --> 00:40:56.490
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

697
00:40:56.609 --> 00:40:57.809
Number six, 58,

698
00:40:57.928 --> 00:40:59.289
212, 485,

699
00:40:59.408 --> 00:41:00.488
952,

700
00:41:00.568 --> 00:41:02.768
and they all end the same way.

701
00:41:04.888 --> 00:41:07.528
But he doesn't give up.

702
00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:11.129
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

703
00:41:11.248 --> 00:41:14.368
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

704
00:41:14.488 --> 00:41:16.007
the first working time machine.

705
00:41:16.128 --> 00:41:19.326
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

706
00:41:19.446 --> 00:41:20.488
the second working time machine.

707
00:41:20.607 --> 00:41:21.766
Kind of small.

708
00:41:21.887 --> 00:41:23.926
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

709
00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:25.447
This, my friend, is merely a model

710
00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:28.365
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

711
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:31.925
is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.

712
00:41:39.005 --> 00:41:40.805
- Pretty amazing story, huh?
- Yeah.

713
00:41:40.925 --> 00:41:43.284
Now, are you ready to start working?

714
00:41:56.645 --> 00:41:59.164
I think that's it. I did it!

715
00:41:59.285 --> 00:42:00.644
I knew you could.

716
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:06.084
Nice work, my friend.

717
00:42:17.283 --> 00:42:19.562
Well, you know what they say!
"Keep moving..."

718
00:42:19.683 --> 00:42:21.162
Don't say it!

719
00:42:27.523 --> 00:42:28.721
Boys! Dinner time!

720
00:42:28.841 --> 00:42:29.961
Not now, Mom!

721
00:42:30.082 --> 00:42:33.561
If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!

722
00:42:35.402 --> 00:42:37.360
We'd better get up there.

723
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:43.200
Let's get that boy!

724
00:42:44.201 --> 00:42:45.240
Sit here?

725
00:42:45.361 --> 00:42:46.961
But I want to look, too.

726
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.680
A mini-Doris!

727
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.879
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

728
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.719
Let's take her out for a spin.

729
00:42:58.078 --> 00:42:59.479
Sorry.

730
00:43:00.798 --> 00:43:02.000
Teamwork.

731
00:43:04.918 --> 00:43:06.039
Sorry.

732
00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:08.639
Sorry!

733
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.359
There you are.

734
00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:18.959
Now, to lure him out of the house.

735
00:43:20.278 --> 00:43:24.197
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

736
00:43:24.598 --> 00:43:27.356
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

737
00:43:28.197 --> 00:43:29.277
Oh! I know!

738
00:43:29.396 --> 00:43:33.116
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

739
00:43:34.357 --> 00:43:36.236
I don't know how to do that.

740
00:43:36.356 --> 00:43:39.036
I don't really need a duck.

741
00:43:41.036 --> 00:43:43.396
This may be harder than I thought.

742
00:43:46.836 --> 00:43:47.916
Hey, ring my doorbell.

743
00:43:48.035 --> 00:43:49.756
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

744
00:43:49.875 --> 00:43:51.555
That doorbell will give you a rash.

745
00:43:52.635 --> 00:43:54.474
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

746
00:43:54.594 --> 00:43:56.115
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

747
00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:58.315
- Come on. Read your rule book.
- You know what?

748
00:43:58.435 --> 00:44:00.154
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

749
00:44:01.113 --> 00:44:03.594
I don't believe in fretting or grieving

750
00:44:03.713 --> 00:44:05.714
Why mess around with strife?

751
00:44:06.434 --> 00:44:09.513
Guess I was cut out
To step out and strut out

752
00:44:09.635 --> 00:44:10.872
Give me the simple life

753
00:44:10.993 --> 00:44:14.755
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

754
00:44:14.875 --> 00:44:17.314
Dinner is served.

755
00:44:17.434 --> 00:44:18.435
Dinner is served.

756
00:44:21.074 --> 00:44:22.794
Hooray! Italian food.

757
00:44:22.914 --> 00:44:24.275
I want a sloppy joe!

758
00:44:24.393 --> 00:44:26.553
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

759
00:44:26.673 --> 00:44:27.832
Coming to you, big girl.

760
00:44:27.953 --> 00:44:31.513
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

761
00:44:31.632 --> 00:44:33.432
on the black moon of Keward.

762
00:44:34.233 --> 00:44:36.152
Where's my sloppy joe?

763
00:44:36.272 --> 00:44:37.632
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

764
00:44:37.751 --> 00:44:39.913
- We gotta talk.
- How about some gravy? Over here.

765
00:44:40.031 --> 00:44:42.672
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

766
00:44:42.792 --> 00:44:46.391
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

767
00:44:46.512 --> 00:44:47.552
Temporary setback.

768
00:44:47.672 --> 00:44:49.392
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

769
00:44:49.512 --> 00:44:50.552
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.

770
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:51.992
- I give a mean back rub.
- No.

771
00:44:52.112 --> 00:44:53.111
- Shiatsu?
- No.

772
00:44:53.231 --> 00:44:54.312
- Feng shui.
- No.

773
00:44:54.431 --> 00:44:55.672
I've got it under control.

774
00:44:57.311 --> 00:44:59.149
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

775
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.311
- No.
- Yes.

776
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:01.469
- Yes.
- No.

777
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:02.910
Well, yes and no.

778
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:05.710
Lewis is a new transfer student.

779
00:45:05.989 --> 00:45:07.029
Yeah.

780
00:45:07.149 --> 00:45:09.548
- Where are you from, Lewis?
- Canada?

781
00:45:09.668 --> 00:45:13.030
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

782
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.750
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

783
00:45:16.189 --> 00:45:18.228
- It's a big country.
- State.

784
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:20.990
- I wonder if you're related.
- Maybe if he took his hat off.

785
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:22.350
Oh, good idea.

786
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.867
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

787
00:45:24.989 --> 00:45:28.189
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

788
00:45:28.308 --> 00:45:29.748
Oh, nonsense.

789
00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:32.668
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

790
00:45:32.787 --> 00:45:34.068
Let's see the cowlick!

791
00:45:34.187 --> 00:45:35.549
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

792
00:45:35.668 --> 00:45:36.828
Lewis, do you mind?

793
00:45:36.949 --> 00:45:39.188
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

794
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:40.668
- But... But...
- And so it begins.

795
00:45:40.788 --> 00:45:41.827
Now, don't be shy.

796
00:45:41.946 --> 00:45:44.348
- We're all family here.
- Ready, aim, fire!

797
00:45:48.747 --> 00:45:51.826
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

798
00:45:55.266 --> 00:45:56.625
Impressive, little sister.

799
00:45:56.745 --> 00:45:59.305
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

800
00:45:59.426 --> 00:46:01.626
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

801
00:46:01.747 --> 00:46:05.146
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

802
00:46:15.104 --> 00:46:17.144
Your meatballs are useless against me.

803
00:46:17.265 --> 00:46:20.703
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

804
00:46:20.824 --> 00:46:21.944
No!

805
00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:33.423
That's right. I did it.

806
00:46:33.544 --> 00:46:35.065
Is dinner like this every night?

807
00:46:35.184 --> 00:46:36.904
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

808
00:46:41.863 --> 00:46:44.503
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

809
00:46:44.622 --> 00:46:48.783
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

810
00:46:49.662 --> 00:46:51.783
Hey, that's just like...

811
00:46:55.623 --> 00:46:56.900
Stupid...

812
00:46:57.022 --> 00:46:58.141
Carl?

813
00:46:58.261 --> 00:46:59.261
Is everything all right?

814
00:46:59.381 --> 00:47:02.821
We're just experiencing bugs.

815
00:47:04.661 --> 00:47:06.101
Just what the doctor ordered.

816
00:47:06.781 --> 00:47:08.980
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

817
00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.578
Wilbur, you know I can't.

818
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.381
Come on. Give it a try.

819
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.021
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

820
00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.660
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

821
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.539
We're past the point of no return!

822
00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.739
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

823
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.500
We all pay!

824
00:47:25.098 --> 00:47:26.099
I don't know.

825
00:47:26.218 --> 00:47:28.180
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

826
00:47:28.298 --> 00:47:29.418
Please.

827
00:47:33.498 --> 00:47:35.578
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

828
00:47:35.698 --> 00:47:38.819
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

829
00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:41.580
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

830
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.459
All right, you bozos.

831
00:47:44.058 --> 00:47:46.258
Have to get that boy out of the house.

832
00:47:47.538 --> 00:47:49.058
Sorry. Wait!

833
00:47:49.178 --> 00:47:51.337
So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?

834
00:47:51.458 --> 00:47:54.577
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

835
00:47:54.698 --> 00:47:57.298
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

836
00:47:57.418 --> 00:47:59.777
I says,
"Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."

837
00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:03.217
- Frankie, you're a riot.
- I gotta go pee!

838
00:48:03.337 --> 00:48:04.817
- I love it.
- You bunch of goons.

839
00:48:14.137 --> 00:48:16.015
That's a good buzz. What the...

840
00:48:16.375 --> 00:48:19.575
Yes! You are now under my control.

841
00:48:19.695 --> 00:48:21.694
I am now under your control.

842
00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:26.095
- Stop laughing.
- Stop laughing.

843
00:48:26.214 --> 00:48:29.014
- Don't repeat everything I say.
- I won't repeat everything you say.

844
00:48:29.134 --> 00:48:30.895
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

845
00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:33.774
Did you just say, "Excellent,"
because I said, "Excellent"?

846
00:48:35.214 --> 00:48:36.253
No.

847
00:48:36.373 --> 00:48:38.494
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

848
00:48:39.614 --> 00:48:43.134
- So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
- Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

849
00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:45.173
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

850
00:48:45.293 --> 00:48:47.412
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

851
00:48:48.053 --> 00:48:51.054
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

852
00:48:51.174 --> 00:48:52.933
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

853
00:48:53.053 --> 00:48:54.653
Bring him to me.

854
00:48:56.573 --> 00:49:00.093
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

855
00:49:00.852 --> 00:49:04.252
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

856
00:49:04.812 --> 00:49:06.452
and I have little arms.

857
00:49:07.092 --> 00:49:10.252
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

858
00:49:13.733 --> 00:49:14.853
Master?

859
00:49:16.731 --> 00:49:17.771
Master?

860
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.211
Okay, that should do it.

861
00:49:21.572 --> 00:49:24.010
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

862
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:26.771
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

863
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.131
Everybody ready?

864
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:29.930
- Go, Carl.
- Yeah!

865
00:49:33.249 --> 00:49:34.329
Is it gonna work?

866
00:49:34.449 --> 00:49:35.650
Oh, no!

867
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:40.929
No!

868
00:49:41.049 --> 00:49:44.328
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

869
00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:46.809
- You failed!
- And it was awesome!

870
00:49:46.928 --> 00:49:49.089
- Exceptional!
- Outstanding!

871
00:49:50.049 --> 00:49:51.009
I've seen better.

872
00:49:51.128 --> 00:49:54.808
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

873
00:49:54.928 --> 00:49:56.608
If I gave up every time I failed,

874
00:49:56.729 --> 00:49:58.568
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

875
00:49:58.687 --> 00:50:01.047
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

876
00:50:03.449 --> 00:50:04.648
Still working out the kinks.

877
00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.927
Like my husband always says...

878
00:50:14.208 --> 00:50:15.646
Keep moving
Keep moving

879
00:50:15.767 --> 00:50:16.766
Stop

880
00:50:21.486 --> 00:50:24.646
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

881
00:50:24.766 --> 00:50:27.046
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

882
00:50:27.166 --> 00:50:28.806
Something that won't talk back.

883
00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:31.006
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

884
00:50:31.566 --> 00:50:32.525
Oh, my noggin.

885
00:50:32.645 --> 00:50:34.886
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

886
00:50:35.005 --> 00:50:36.925
You're gonna regret this!

887
00:50:37.805 --> 00:50:42.043
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

888
00:50:43.245 --> 00:50:45.525
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

889
00:50:45.764 --> 00:50:47.843
No, I'll make it a surprise.

890
00:50:54.205 --> 00:50:55.805
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

891
00:50:55.923 --> 00:50:59.563
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

892
00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:02.123
May it lead to success in the future.

893
00:51:02.563 --> 00:51:04.803
Gosh, you're all so nice.

894
00:51:05.323 --> 00:51:07.604
If I had a family, I...

895
00:51:08.523 --> 00:51:10.563
I'd want them to be just like you.

896
00:51:10.922 --> 00:51:13.282
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

897
00:51:13.402 --> 00:51:14.924
To Lewis!

898
00:51:15.042 --> 00:51:16.003
To Lewis!

899
00:51:16.123 --> 00:51:17.243
Yeah!

900
00:51:17.602 --> 00:51:20.163
- Come on, Lewis!
- Good show, buddy!

901
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:23.202
What if Louis Armstrong said,
"I can't"?

902
00:51:23.322 --> 00:51:24.481
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

903
00:51:24.602 --> 00:51:26.842
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

904
00:51:30.001 --> 00:51:32.362
What did he mean, if he had a family?

905
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:33.800
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

906
00:51:33.922 --> 00:51:35.200
Orphan?

907
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:49.799
- Oh, no!
- Big boy!

908
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.320
Get up, you pansy!

909
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.679
What a great plan!

910
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.918
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

911
00:51:58.719 --> 00:52:01.078
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

912
00:52:01.198 --> 00:52:02.198
Because we don't.

913
00:52:02.318 --> 00:52:04.359
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

914
00:52:06.479 --> 00:52:09.078
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

915
00:52:09.197 --> 00:52:10.759
I need him alive.

916
00:52:12.718 --> 00:52:14.078
Choo-chew on this!

917
00:52:17.639 --> 00:52:19.038
Lewis!

918
00:52:24.676 --> 00:52:27.318
Ready, aim, fire!

919
00:52:35.836 --> 00:52:37.076
Got you!

920
00:52:39.315 --> 00:52:41.556
You messed with the wrong family!

921
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:50.595
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

922
00:52:55.434 --> 00:52:56.435
No!

923
00:52:58.434 --> 00:53:01.314
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

924
00:53:03.715 --> 00:53:05.153
Run!

925
00:53:07.193 --> 00:53:08.754
Oh! He ate Carl!

926
00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:13.152
- Help us! Help! Help!
- Oh, goodness!

927
00:53:24.915 --> 00:53:25.874
Oh, no.

928
00:53:31.793 --> 00:53:32.992
Incoming!

929
00:53:34.232 --> 00:53:35.311
Run!

930
00:53:36.591 --> 00:53:39.152
Now, go get that boy!

931
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:57.470
What's going on?

932
00:53:57.669 --> 00:53:58.630
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

933
00:53:58.749 --> 00:53:59.908
I have a big head...

934
00:54:00.029 --> 00:54:01.669
...and little arms.

935
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.190
I'm just not sure...

936
00:54:03.308 --> 00:54:05.069
...how well this plan was
thought through.

937
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:08.869
Master?

938
00:54:09.911 --> 00:54:12.070
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

939
00:54:15.988 --> 00:54:17.068
Bowler Hat Guy!

940
00:54:17.188 --> 00:54:18.508
Him you can eat.

941
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:20.908
- Lewis, run!
- Wilbur!

942
00:54:38.387 --> 00:54:39.387
No!

943
00:55:00.025 --> 00:55:01.346
Oh, no!

944
00:55:02.705 --> 00:55:05.545
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

945
00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:12.584
- Nice catch.
- Nice meatball shooting!

946
00:55:12.705 --> 00:55:14.183
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

947
00:55:14.304 --> 00:55:15.904
Yeah, guess we did.

948
00:55:16.783 --> 00:55:18.624
- Are you boys all right?
- We're good, Mom.

949
00:55:18.745 --> 00:55:20.423
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

950
00:55:20.543 --> 00:55:22.784
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

951
00:55:23.905 --> 00:55:27.224
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

952
00:55:27.343 --> 00:55:28.863
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

953
00:55:31.902 --> 00:55:33.622
I'm really happy you're safe.

954
00:55:33.903 --> 00:55:35.502
- Your head.
- What?

955
00:55:36.462 --> 00:55:37.982
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

956
00:55:39.062 --> 00:55:42.583
You all sacrificed so much for me.

957
00:55:42.703 --> 00:55:45.543
- Well, of course.
- You are a special kid.

958
00:55:45.662 --> 00:55:46.823
One of a kind.

959
00:55:46.942 --> 00:55:50.063
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

960
00:55:50.182 --> 00:55:53.221
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

961
00:55:53.582 --> 00:55:55.781
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

962
00:55:55.902 --> 00:55:57.700
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

963
00:55:57.821 --> 00:56:00.621
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

964
00:56:02.621 --> 00:56:05.979
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

965
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:09.421
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

966
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.341
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

967
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.260
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

968
00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.299
- Mom.
- The truth is, we love having you.

969
00:56:18.419 --> 00:56:20.820
- We really have to go.
- No.

970
00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:24.619
No, you don't. You have to stay.

971
00:56:25.338 --> 00:56:28.738
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

972
00:56:29.578 --> 00:56:31.018
What do you say, Lewis?

973
00:56:31.978 --> 00:56:33.458
Do you want to be a Robinson?

974
00:56:35.978 --> 00:56:38.858
You want to adopt me?

975
00:56:48.216 --> 00:56:49.856
- Yeah!
- Yes!

976
00:56:58.537 --> 00:57:00.856
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

977
00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:02.097
Now you know the big secret.

978
00:57:02.217 --> 00:57:06.175
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

979
00:57:06.296 --> 00:57:08.096
That is an excellent question.

980
00:57:08.216 --> 00:57:09.655
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

981
00:57:09.776 --> 00:57:11.096
He was just being a good friend.

982
00:57:11.215 --> 00:57:15.174
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

983
00:57:15.296 --> 00:57:16.655
What? You just said...

984
00:57:16.776 --> 00:57:18.575
I know what I said.

985
00:57:18.695 --> 00:57:20.576
I'm from the past. So what?

986
00:57:21.656 --> 00:57:24.095
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

987
00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:26.255
You're a great kid,

988
00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:29.174
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

989
00:57:30.455 --> 00:57:33.933
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

990
00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:39.932
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

991
00:57:40.133 --> 00:57:43.453
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

992
00:57:43.573 --> 00:57:46.413
which kind of explains the dino.

993
00:57:51.532 --> 00:57:52.733
I'm calling your father.

994
00:57:52.852 --> 00:57:54.332
Wait. If I have to leave,

995
00:57:54.452 --> 00:57:56.573
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

996
00:57:56.771 --> 00:57:58.331
Wilbur promised.

997
00:57:58.451 --> 00:57:59.613
You promised what?

998
00:57:59.733 --> 00:58:01.492
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

999
00:58:02.132 --> 00:58:04.412
- You lied to me?
- No!

1000
00:58:05.691 --> 00:58:06.693
Yes.

1001
00:58:07.092 --> 00:58:08.292
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1002
00:58:08.412 --> 00:58:11.772
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

1003
00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:13.691
I am your friend!

1004
00:58:13.812 --> 00:58:17.211
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1005
00:58:37.809 --> 00:58:41.050
Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.

1006
00:58:41.169 --> 00:58:46.047
All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,

1007
00:58:46.929 --> 00:58:51.288
but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.

1008
00:58:52.247 --> 00:58:55.087
Too bad
we don't have a time machine.

1009
00:58:55.207 --> 00:58:58.527
Oh, wait. We do.

1010
00:58:58.887 --> 00:59:00.367
Bowler Hat Guy?

1011
00:59:00.727 --> 00:59:03.406
- Hello, Lewis.
- What do you want?

1012
00:59:03.526 --> 00:59:06.087
To make your dream come true.

1013
00:59:06.206 --> 00:59:09.207
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1014
00:59:09.328 --> 00:59:11.727
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

1015
00:59:12.527 --> 00:59:13.608
Lewis!

1016
00:59:14.527 --> 00:59:16.846
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

1017
00:59:16.966 --> 00:59:18.605
I know you're around here somewhere.

1018
00:59:21.285 --> 00:59:22.286
Lewis!

1019
00:59:42.683 --> 00:59:45.922
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

1020
00:59:45.923 --> 00:59:48.243
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

1021
00:59:48.363 --> 00:59:50.364
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1022
00:59:50.484 --> 00:59:52.124
It doesn't work. Never did.

1023
00:59:52.244 --> 00:59:53.243
Well, supposing it did,

1024
00:59:53.364 --> 00:59:55.124
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

1025
00:59:55.243 --> 00:59:58.163
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

1026
00:59:58.282 --> 00:59:59.882
where might one find the "On" switch?

1027
01:00:00.442 --> 01:00:01.962
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1028
01:00:02.082 --> 01:00:04.162
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1029
01:00:04.283 --> 01:00:05.842
then push this red button,

1030
01:00:05.962 --> 01:00:07.242
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1031
01:00:07.361 --> 01:00:08.642
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1032
01:00:08.761 --> 01:00:10.722
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1033
01:00:10.842 --> 01:00:12.163
Yes, of course.

1034
01:00:12.283 --> 01:00:13.442
Doris?

1035
01:00:16.201 --> 01:00:17.161
We had a deal!

1036
01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.083
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1037
01:00:19.202 --> 01:00:21.642
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

1038
01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:23.642
You still haven't figured it out?

1039
01:00:23.761 --> 01:00:25.041
Figured out what?

1040
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.080
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1041
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:29.481
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

1042
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.041
"Keep moving forward"?

1043
01:00:31.162 --> 01:00:33.519
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1044
01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.600
Are you saying

1045
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.040
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1046
01:00:42.959 --> 01:00:44.681
Give the boy a prize.

1047
01:00:45.279 --> 01:00:48.599
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

1048
01:00:48.718 --> 01:00:50.279
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1049
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.319
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
- Well...

1050
01:00:53.839 --> 01:00:55.559
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1051
01:00:55.678 --> 01:00:56.678
Keep going.

1052
01:00:57.199 --> 01:00:58.919
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1053
01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:00.638
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1054
01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:03.318
But what does that have to do
with you?

1055
01:01:04.358 --> 01:01:07.158
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

1056
01:01:09.997 --> 01:01:11.317
My old room!

1057
01:01:11.437 --> 01:01:13.718
I think you mean our old room.

1058
01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.756
- What?
- Yes! Yes, it is I,

1059
01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:18.116
Mike Yagoobian!

1060
01:01:18.795 --> 01:01:22.277
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1061
01:01:22.397 --> 01:01:23.757
How did you end up like this?

1062
01:01:23.877 --> 01:01:28.478
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

1063
01:01:28.598 --> 01:01:31.115
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

1064
01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:37.716
a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.

1065
01:01:38.116 --> 01:01:40.875
We lost by one run because of me.

1066
01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:42.035
Get him!

1067
01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:46.034
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

1068
01:01:46.194 --> 01:01:48.115
And we would have won!

1069
01:01:48.235 --> 01:01:49.715
Do you understand?

1070
01:01:49.835 --> 01:01:52.355
For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.

1071
01:01:52.474 --> 01:01:55.475
Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.

1072
01:01:55.594 --> 01:01:59.153
This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.

1073
01:01:59.273 --> 01:02:00.793
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1074
01:02:00.914 --> 01:02:02.794
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

1075
01:02:02.914 --> 01:02:04.753
They all hated me.

1076
01:02:05.032 --> 01:02:08.272
Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,

1077
01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:09.953
except me.

1078
01:02:10.074 --> 01:02:11.913
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.

1079
01:02:12.033 --> 01:02:13.194
- Robinson reaches out to...
- It's new name,

1080
01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:15.234
- Robinson Industries.
- Cornelius Robinson!

1081
01:02:15.353 --> 01:02:18.312
- Cornelius Robinson is now...
- Now here's another amazing...

1082
01:02:18.432 --> 01:02:23.392
It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.

1083
01:02:23.513 --> 01:02:24.832
It was yours.

1084
01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:28.031
If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,

1085
01:02:28.551 --> 01:02:30.111
then I wouldn't have missed the catch,

1086
01:02:30.231 --> 01:02:34.111
so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.

1087
01:02:36.792 --> 01:02:39.392
Robinson, you stink!

1088
01:02:39.872 --> 01:02:43.870
Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,

1089
01:02:44.391 --> 01:02:46.631
I met her.

1090
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.750
We retreated to our villainous lair,

1091
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:54.869
where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.

1092
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.269
Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,

1093
01:02:58.388 --> 01:03:00.511
a slave to humankind,

1094
01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:07.388
but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.

1095
01:03:12.468 --> 01:03:15.149
However, you didn't see
her true potential.

1096
01:03:15.267 --> 01:03:17.188
- Got it.
- So you shut her down,

1097
01:03:23.546 --> 01:03:25.467
or so you thought.

1098
01:03:34.707 --> 01:03:36.826
We both had a score
to settle with you,

1099
01:03:37.506 --> 01:03:42.385
and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...

1100
01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:44.267
Well, we went with Doris',

1101
01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:48.786
but I made
a very, very important contribution.

1102
01:03:48.787 --> 01:03:51.266
Together we made the perfect team.

1103
01:04:01.025 --> 01:04:01.985
Wilbur!

1104
01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:04.664
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

1105
01:04:04.785 --> 01:04:05.864
Yeah, Mom.

1106
01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.702
I went to your house,
snuck in the garage

1107
01:04:11.823 --> 01:04:13.505
and stole the time machine,

1108
01:04:16.384 --> 01:04:21.143
all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.

1109
01:04:25.303 --> 01:04:28.223
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

1110
01:04:28.343 --> 01:04:30.981
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

1111
01:04:31.102 --> 01:04:33.383
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

1112
01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:36.501
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

1113
01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.183
Goob, I had no idea.

1114
01:04:38.302 --> 01:04:40.103
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1115
01:04:40.223 --> 01:04:42.781
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

1116
01:04:43.342 --> 01:04:45.181
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

1117
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:47.300
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

1118
01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.980
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

1119
01:04:51.101 --> 01:04:54.701
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

1120
01:04:54.821 --> 01:04:55.822
Let's see.

1121
01:04:55.941 --> 01:04:58.701
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

1122
01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:02.461
"Blame you" wins hands down!

1123
01:05:05.821 --> 01:05:08.940
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

1124
01:05:16.658 --> 01:05:19.858
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

1125
01:05:26.578 --> 01:05:27.819
No!

1126
01:05:29.178 --> 01:05:33.259
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

1127
01:05:35.497 --> 01:05:36.937
But...

1128
01:05:37.057 --> 01:05:38.977
I bet you're glad to see me.

1129
01:05:40.057 --> 01:05:42.058
That's for not locking the garage door.

1130
01:05:43.496 --> 01:05:44.616
You know about that?

1131
01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:46.057
I know everything.

1132
01:05:46.177 --> 01:05:47.137
You gotta admit,

1133
01:05:47.256 --> 01:05:49.296
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

1134
01:05:52.177 --> 01:05:54.538
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

1135
01:06:03.216 --> 01:06:04.616
Oh, no!

1136
01:06:06.175 --> 01:06:07.976
Take a good look around, boys,

1137
01:06:08.095 --> 01:06:10.695
because your future
is about to change.

1138
01:06:12.256 --> 01:06:14.696
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

1139
01:06:14.814 --> 01:06:16.815
No. No, I can't.

1140
01:06:23.134 --> 01:06:25.254
What about your dad?
You could call him.

1141
01:06:25.494 --> 01:06:27.775
- You are my dad.
- But that's in the future.

1142
01:06:27.894 --> 01:06:30.493
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

1143
01:06:34.214 --> 01:06:35.453
Look, I messed up.

1144
01:06:35.693 --> 01:06:38.533
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1145
01:06:38.653 --> 01:06:39.654
but now it's up to you.

1146
01:06:41.694 --> 01:06:43.012
You can do it, Dad.

1147
01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:49.253
- Lewis? Lewis!
- Wilbur? Wilbur!

1148
01:06:53.212 --> 01:06:54.251
Wilbur.

1149
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:57.452
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1150
01:07:11.492 --> 01:07:13.531
Prepare to be amazed.

1151
01:07:13.651 --> 01:07:16.251
I call it the Memory Scanner.

1152
01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:19.690
So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?

1153
01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:23.050
Yes. I call them Helping Hats.

1154
01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:27.490
They're everywhere!

1155
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:32.208
Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.

1156
01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:35.009
I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.

1157
01:07:36.209 --> 01:07:38.128
No!

1158
01:07:43.648 --> 01:07:47.007
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1159
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:50.367
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1160
01:09:44.959 --> 01:09:47.999
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1161
01:09:58.238 --> 01:10:03.037
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

1162
01:10:11.157 --> 01:10:12.598
Goob, stop!

1163
01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:14.316
You don't know what you're doing!

1164
01:10:14.437 --> 01:10:16.436
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1165
01:10:16.556 --> 01:10:17.637
She's using you, Goob,

1166
01:10:17.757 --> 01:10:19.837
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

1167
01:10:19.956 --> 01:10:21.677
What? What?

1168
01:10:26.796 --> 01:10:29.156
I am never going to invent you.

1169
01:10:35.195 --> 01:10:37.555
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

1170
01:10:46.435 --> 01:10:47.555
Doris?

1171
01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:49.633
I thought she was my friend.

1172
01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:22.351
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1173
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.472
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1174
01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:27.591
Let him go.

1175
01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:30.351
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1176
01:11:30.472 --> 01:11:33.031
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1177
01:11:33.192 --> 01:11:34.871
- What?
- He's my old roommate,

1178
01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.471
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

1179
01:11:36.591 --> 01:11:38.709
- Are you nuts?
- Give me one good reason why not.

1180
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:40.190
I'll give you three good reasons.

1181
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:42.630
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

1182
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.990
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1183
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:48.430
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

1184
01:11:50.629 --> 01:11:53.669
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

1185
01:11:53.789 --> 01:11:55.791
- Where'd he go?
- Goob?

1186
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:57.910
Goob!

1187
01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:00.990
Goob.

1188
01:12:27.387 --> 01:12:28.386
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1189
01:12:28.506 --> 01:12:30.026
- No, I'm...
- Do you have a temperature?

1190
01:12:30.147 --> 01:12:31.547
- Brain fog?
- Scurvy?

1191
01:12:31.666 --> 01:12:32.707
- Tapeworm?
- Cellulite?

1192
01:12:32.827 --> 01:12:35.344
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1193
01:12:35.467 --> 01:12:39.066
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

1194
01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:42.306
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

1195
01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:44.105
- Oh, boy.
- Well, he's home early.

1196
01:12:44.224 --> 01:12:47.585
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

1197
01:13:00.665 --> 01:13:02.344
Ratted out by the old lady.

1198
01:13:03.384 --> 01:13:04.544
Harsh.

1199
01:13:09.065 --> 01:13:10.223
Okay.

1200
01:13:20.303 --> 01:13:23.343
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

1201
01:13:23.462 --> 01:13:25.223
Yeah, no kidding.

1202
01:13:25.383 --> 01:13:27.662
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1203
01:13:27.783 --> 01:13:29.101
Yeah.

1204
01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:33.942
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1205
01:13:47.141 --> 01:13:49.340
It was our first real invention.

1206
01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:51.660
It's the one that started it all.

1207
01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.861
Wowie.

1208
01:13:53.819 --> 01:13:57.380
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

1209
01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.020
Well, that depends on you.

1210
01:14:00.139 --> 01:14:01.099
Nothing is set in stone.

1211
01:14:01.221 --> 01:14:04.860
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

1212
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:11.899
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

1213
01:14:12.019 --> 01:14:16.098
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

1214
01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:19.738
Do we ever meet her?

1215
01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.658
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

1216
01:14:24.779 --> 01:14:27.419
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

1217
01:14:27.538 --> 01:14:29.658
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1218
01:14:30.658 --> 01:14:33.657
That's because we are one smart kid.

1219
01:14:38.457 --> 01:14:39.416
- So long!
- Bye-bye, Lewis!

1220
01:14:39.538 --> 01:14:41.935
- Farewell, future brother-in-law.
- So long! See you later, Lewis!

1221
01:14:42.057 --> 01:14:43.777
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1222
01:14:45.097 --> 01:14:47.056
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
- I will.

1223
01:14:47.177 --> 01:14:48.856
Hey, while I got you here,

1224
01:14:48.976 --> 01:14:52.256
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

1225
01:14:52.376 --> 01:14:56.736
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1226
01:14:56.855 --> 01:14:59.735
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

1227
01:14:59.855 --> 01:15:02.174
- Are you kidding? No way!
- I love you.

1228
01:15:03.294 --> 01:15:05.654
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

1229
01:15:05.775 --> 01:15:08.294
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

1230
01:15:08.414 --> 01:15:09.375
- But I...
- Don't worry.

1231
01:15:09.494 --> 01:15:12.214
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

1232
01:15:12.334 --> 01:15:15.576
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1233
01:15:15.694 --> 01:15:18.133
- Goodbye, son.
- Thanks again for everything!

1234
01:15:18.255 --> 01:15:20.654
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
- Yeah?

1235
01:15:20.775 --> 01:15:25.453
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

1236
01:15:25.575 --> 01:15:28.373
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1237
01:15:30.373 --> 01:15:33.454
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

1238
01:15:34.334 --> 01:15:35.574
And I am.

1239
01:15:36.333 --> 01:15:38.012
Then you're absolutely right.

1240
01:15:40.492 --> 01:15:42.253
All right, I'm coming.

1241
01:15:42.773 --> 01:15:44.572
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

1242
01:15:44.692 --> 01:15:46.412
They are your family, after all.

1243
01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:16.009
Wait a minute.

1244
01:16:16.128 --> 01:16:18.130
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

1245
01:16:18.249 --> 01:16:19.369
I know.

1246
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:27.371
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

1247
01:16:27.489 --> 01:16:30.009
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

1248
01:16:30.129 --> 01:16:31.928
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1249
01:16:32.049 --> 01:16:33.169
What?

1250
01:16:50.967 --> 01:16:52.327
A deal's a deal.

1251
01:18:50.639 --> 01:18:53.399
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1252
01:18:54.118 --> 01:18:57.158
Because I already have a family.

1253
01:19:05.957 --> 01:19:09.436
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

1254
01:19:10.396 --> 01:19:12.476
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

1255
01:19:14.197 --> 01:19:15.196
I won't.

1256
01:19:15.316 --> 01:19:17.197
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1257
01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:18.756
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

1258
01:19:18.876 --> 01:19:19.997
till you get it right.

1259
01:19:22.156 --> 01:19:23.715
- You got that motto?
- I got it.

1260
01:19:23.836 --> 01:19:25.035
Don't forget it.

1261
01:19:25.155 --> 01:19:26.876
I don't think that's possible.

1262
01:19:28.275 --> 01:19:29.435
You better get going.

1263
01:19:30.196 --> 01:19:31.675
See you later, Wilbur.

1264
01:19:49.315 --> 01:19:50.794
Wait a minute!

1265
01:19:59.033 --> 01:20:00.954
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1266
01:20:01.074 --> 01:20:02.073
What?

1267
01:20:04.873 --> 01:20:06.192
That's it!

1268
01:20:13.953 --> 01:20:16.632
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

1269
01:20:16.751 --> 01:20:18.872
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1270
01:20:20.911 --> 01:20:23.591
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1271
01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:26.751
I need a volunteer.

1272
01:20:29.951 --> 01:20:31.510
Now, just give me a date to input.

1273
01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:32.991
Well, now, let's see.

1274
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:36.110
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

1275
01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:39.230
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

1276
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.470
I know.

1277
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:43.750
Perfect!

1278
01:20:55.668 --> 01:20:58.549
- You look gorgeous.
- He's a lucky guy.

1279
01:21:00.549 --> 01:21:02.268
Oh! It works.

1280
01:21:02.388 --> 01:21:04.748
- It works!
- It works.

1281
01:21:05.309 --> 01:21:07.468
You look beautiful, Lucille.

1282
01:21:12.507 --> 01:21:13.628
Bud?

1283
01:21:14.867 --> 01:21:16.709
- Would you look at that?
- Whoa!

1284
01:21:16.829 --> 01:21:18.547
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

1285
01:21:18.668 --> 01:21:21.427
- Lucille!
- You did it, Lewis! You did it!

1286
01:21:21.547 --> 01:21:22.866
This invention is brilliant!

1287
01:21:22.986 --> 01:21:24.387
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

1288
01:21:24.507 --> 01:21:26.546
That was some show you put on.

1289
01:21:26.667 --> 01:21:29.987
You're a real special kid,

1290
01:21:32.665 --> 01:21:35.746
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

1291
01:21:35.865 --> 01:21:38.466
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

1292
01:21:39.586 --> 01:21:41.906
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

1293
01:21:42.026 --> 01:21:43.345
No harm done.

1294
01:21:44.185 --> 01:21:46.425
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

1295
01:21:46.546 --> 01:21:48.784
- Frankie?
- My star pupil.

1296
01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:53.584
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

1297
01:21:53.704 --> 01:21:54.785
Really?

1298
01:21:55.663 --> 01:21:58.463
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

1299
01:21:58.584 --> 01:22:00.903
But nobody believes me.

1300
01:22:01.704 --> 01:22:03.703
They all think I'm crazy.

1301
01:22:04.985 --> 01:22:07.664
You think I'm crazy, too.

1302
01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:10.664
No. No, I think you're right.

1303
01:22:14.024 --> 01:22:15.742
Over here? There he is.

1304
01:22:15.863 --> 01:22:18.943
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

1305
01:22:19.063 --> 01:22:21.542
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

1306
01:22:25.863 --> 01:22:26.903
Yeah.
