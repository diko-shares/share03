Burt. Shut that
bloody thing up.

27
00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:34.884
Do you know what time
it is? Burt!

28
00:03:35.484 --> 00:03:38.381
Burt! You stupid old bastard!

29
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:40.379
What do you think
you're doing?

30
00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.377
Sorry George,
what did you say?

31
00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:44.075
Do you know what time it is?

32
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:46.872
I'm sorry, I've got a heck
of a lot to get done today.

33
00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:51.168
And you know what they say.
"The early bird catches the worm".

34
00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:55.064
Well, if you do this again,
one more time, I'm calling the cops.

35
00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:58.959
And how about
mowing your lawns?

36
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.158
It's a bloody disgrace
to the neighbourhood.

37
00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:07.951
Yeah, alright.

38
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:15.744
Hi, kid.

39
00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:34.325
Here we are, the...

40
00:04:35.324 --> 00:04:36.822
perfect recipe...

41
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:39.620
two of Chevy...

42
00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:42.017
one of Ford.

43
00:04:46.113 --> 00:04:50.109
I think those '36 Chevy pistons...

44
00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.906
must have a touch of titanium
or something in them.

45
00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:54.804
They come up real good,
you know.

46
00:04:55.903 --> 00:04:57.502
Hey the kettle's boiling.

47
00:04:57.702 --> 00:04:59.700
Make yourself useful,
make some tea.

48
00:05:05.394 --> 00:05:07.392
Can we have a biscuit too?

49
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.389
- What?
- Can I have a gingernut?

50
00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.786
Yeah, you know where they are,
help yourself.

51
00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:19.180
Now you stay over there,
stay there.

52
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.668
- Right.
- What are you doing for Christmas, Burt?

53
00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:33.765
Christmas? I don't know.
Why?

54
00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:36.062
Are you angling
for a present or something?

55
00:05:36.063 --> 00:05:39.160
- No, I wondered if you were going away.
- No...

56
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.056
no time for Christmas, lad.
Got a lot of work to do.

57
00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:46.453
I only managed twenty seven
test runs this year.

58
00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:49.550
You know, twenty four on the beach
and three on the road.

59
00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.448
All illegal like.

60
00:05:53.246 --> 00:05:55.743
I was going a bit over the speed limit,
I'll have to admit.

61
00:05:55.943 --> 00:05:58.441
- How fast were you going?
- I don't know, I haven't a clue.

62
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.438
That's why I have to get up
to Bonneville.

63
00:06:02.537 --> 00:06:04.435
Found out how fast she will go.

64
00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:21.817
Now, there you go.

65
00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:24.515
Got to get the piston out
of the mould...

66
00:06:25.514 --> 00:06:26.712
and Bob's your uncle.

67
00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:29.410
Right, this is...

68
00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.407
the last part
of the operation now.

69
00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:33.905
To chill the metal.

70
00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:37.202
It heat treats it.
Right, watch yourself.

71
00:06:40.698 --> 00:06:43.196
That's where I got the water
for the kettle from.

72
00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:48.291
Well, you know, it gives the tea
a nice tang of titanium, doesn't it?

73
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.488
Now this bloke,
he once asked me...

74
00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:54.585
"How do you heat treat your pistons?"
And I said: "I don't, mate"...

75
00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:58.680
I just, you know, bung them
in cold water and Bob's your uncle".

76
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.577
And he said:
"Well, that's the heat treatment"...

77
00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:05.673
and he just laughed and
shook his head and walked away like.

78
00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:08.570
Well, look this could be
the perfect piston.

79
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.368
It blooming well ought to be,
I've made hundreds of them.

80
00:07:11.568 --> 00:07:15.064
Look at them all up there,
all blown to smithereens.

81
00:07:16.163 --> 00:07:19.460
- You made all those?
- Yeah, I did. Look perfect.

82
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.857
Beautiful, no inclusions see?

83
00:07:22.357 --> 00:07:27.651
Now Tommy, does your mother have
a carving knife I could borrow?

84
00:07:27.652 --> 00:07:28.950
Carving knife? Yeah?

85
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.948
Yeah.
I need a good sharp knife.

86
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.738
Hang on.

87
00:07:41.138 --> 00:07:43.735
- Thomas, what are you up to?
- Nothing, Mum.

88
00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:45.233
Can I have some bread
and peanut butter?

89
00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:48.031
Ok, but make sure you put everything
away when you've finished.

90
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.529
Sorry about that.

91
00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:00.618
Tom.

92
00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:04.215
- Don't forget the wood.
- No, Mum.

93
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.109
Right.

94
00:08:11.508 --> 00:08:13.306
I hope to get as much...

95
00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:15.903
rubber off as possible.

96
00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:18.900
It has to be perfectly bald,
like that, you see.

97
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.896
- Why's that?
- Well, at high speed...

98
00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:25.394
the centrifugal force...

99
00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:27.891
expands the tyre and...

100
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.987
it rubs against
the frame of the bike.

101
00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:35.883
Have to be careful not to cut
through the cords though.

102
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:40.778
- Why do you pee on your lemon tree?
- What?

103
00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:43.376
Why do you pee on your
lemon tree?

104
00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:48.770
- Who says I do that?
- Mum says she sees you...

105
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.268
every morning and
she goes on and on about it.

106
00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:52.766
Does she?

107
00:08:54.564 --> 00:08:58.860
Well, it's good for it. You shouldn't
waste anything in this world, sonny.

108
00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:02.257
- Well, I'd better be off home.
- Alright then.

109
00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:04.654
Mum gets a bit cross if
I stay over here too long.

110
00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:05.853
She does.

111
00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:12.447
- Are you finished with the knife?
- Not yet, I'll drop it by later.

112
00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:15.743
No, don't do that,
I'll pick it up after school tomorrow.

113
00:09:16.043 --> 00:09:17.242
Alright.

114
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.439
- Bye.
- Cheerio.

115
00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:31.227
- Burt Munro.
- Yeah.

116
00:09:31.228 --> 00:09:33.525
I believe you have
my carving knife.

117
00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:35.823
- Oh yes.
- And my sharpener.

118
00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:39.719
Hang on, here we are.

119
00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.614
Well, thanks a lot, love.

120
00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:56.203
G'day Frank. How are you?

121
00:09:56.303 --> 00:09:59.000
Oh not bad, could be better,
could be worse.

122
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.097
I see your front tyre's going
a bit flat on you there, Burt.

123
00:10:02.397 --> 00:10:05.693
Yeah, well, the good news is,
it's only flat on the bottom.

124
00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:08.990
I'll see you tomorrow night
for the fun and games.

125
00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:09.989
It'll be a good one.

126
00:10:12.287 --> 00:10:13.386
Hello, Fran.

127
00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:18.580
- Give us the lot will you? The usual.
- One pension check. Coming up.

128
00:10:19.979 --> 00:10:21.378
Fran...

129
00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:25.473
I want to ask you a question,
the answer to which is...

130
00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:28.271
a definite yes.

131
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.968
- Alright, Fran?
- Alright.

132
00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:32.766
Yes.

133
00:10:33.765 --> 00:10:35.064
What is the question, Burt?

134
00:10:35.563 --> 00:10:38.660
Would you feel inclined to,
you know, accompany...

135
00:10:39.659 --> 00:10:43.455
an impeccable young gentleman
to a local do tomorrow night?

136
00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:47.651
You're asking me on a date,
Burt Munro?

137
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.048
Well, yeah, I suppose
I am actually, aren't I?

138
00:10:52.446 --> 00:10:53.945
- Would you?
- You're on.

139
00:11:01.138 --> 00:11:02.836
- Hello, son.
- Hey, Burt.

140
00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:05.334
That's disgusting.

141
00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:07.731
It is, isn't it?

142
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.627
All dressed up
for the do tonight...

143
00:11:11.727 --> 00:11:13.524
and I couldn't get
my best shoes on...

144
00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:16.123
because my toe nails had grown
like oyster shells.

145
00:11:16.822 --> 00:11:18.121
Alright...

146
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.019
this should do the trick.

147
00:11:21.517 --> 00:11:22.816
There, look at that.

148
00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:24.414
Little twinkle toes.

149
00:11:31.407 --> 00:11:33.306
- Thanks, Burt.
- Right on.

150
00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:44.594
- Evening, Burt.
- Thank you...

151
00:11:44.894 --> 00:11:47.092
- this is Fran.
- Hello, Fran.

152
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:48.790
Thank you very much.

153
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.988
- Hello, Duncan.
- Burt.

154
00:11:51.687 --> 00:11:55.683
Just going to say hello and be back
in a second, love, alright?

155
00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.980
- How are you?
- Bike going well?

156
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.378
Yeah, not too bad.

157
00:12:00.778 --> 00:12:02.976
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Thanks a lot, mate.

158
00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:05.274
This is a bit of
a surprise, isn't it?

159
00:12:06.073 --> 00:12:08.569
Would you like to buy
a raffle ticket or two?

160
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.567
- What's it for?
- Porky the Pig plus two dozen beers.

161
00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:15.463
We're raising money to send
Burt to the USA. Our mate, Burt.

162
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:19.559
Hello. Come on and dance.

163
00:12:21.058 --> 00:12:24.354
- What's this? The twist?
- This is the twist. You know the twist?

164
00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:26.552
Come twist with me.

165
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.748
See you can twist.

166
00:12:33.945 --> 00:12:36.642
<i>- That's it, that's it.
- This must be it, the atomic invasion.</i>

167
00:12:37.242 --> 00:12:40.338
Then the air clears
and the dust settles down.

168
00:12:40.438 --> 00:12:43.136
You look outside,
have they levelled the town?

169
00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:45.933
But there, in the yard...

170
00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:47.831
so briskly alive...

171
00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:50.229
stands Burt Munro's trusty...

172
00:12:50.628 --> 00:12:52.726
old Indian Scout '45.

173
00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:00.318
That was a wonderful
tribute to Burt.

174
00:13:00.618 --> 00:13:03.415
Now come on Burt, we want you up
on stage, come on...

175
00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:05.114
come on, up you come.

176
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.107
I hope all of you have bought
a raffle ticket tonight...

177
00:13:12.406 --> 00:13:16.602
because we believe Burt will put
the Southland Motorcycle Club...

178
00:13:16.603 --> 00:13:17.701
<i>on the map.</i>

179
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.989
What's going on out there?

180
00:13:30.588 --> 00:13:31.987
Get out of here.

181
00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:34.984
Oh, dear.

182
00:13:42.576 --> 00:13:46.872
Well folks, it looks like
I've cracked it, I've um you know.

183
00:13:47.072 --> 00:13:48.770
You Burt Munro?

184
00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:51.168
- What did he say?
- I said, are you Burt Munro?

185
00:13:51.867 --> 00:13:53.965
Are you looking for old Burt?

186
00:13:54.264 --> 00:13:56.262
I don't know,
anyone seen Burt anywhere?

187
00:13:56.662 --> 00:13:58.260
Anyone seen Burt?

188
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.558
- No, he's...
- You are, you're Burt Munro.

189
00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:03.755
You're the old codger,
rides the Army Indian right?

190
00:14:03.955 --> 00:14:06.252
That old joker.
Burt Munro. Yeah.

191
00:14:06.952 --> 00:14:08.450
Yeah, that's me I think.

192
00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:13.445
Now the, ah, young fella,
the army Indian is a real dog...

193
00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:15.643
what I've got is the...

194
00:14:16.143 --> 00:14:20.238
genuine article,
the 1920 V twin Scout.

195
00:14:20.538 --> 00:14:23.835
<i>- That's the one with the pedals, right?
- Don't put up with that, Burt.</i>

196
00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:30.328
No, well. Well, I don't know what sort of
push bikes you monkeys came into town on...

197
00:14:30.428 --> 00:14:35.223
but I know my old timer would trash
the backsides of whatever they are.

198
00:14:35.923 --> 00:14:38.021
- I don't think so, granddad.
- No.

199
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.116
Well, why don't you chaps
put your money where your mouth is?

200
00:14:44.115 --> 00:14:45.813
You're on. You old coot.

201
00:14:49.609 --> 00:14:52.007
- Looks like they've chickened out, Burt.
- What?

202
00:14:52.008 --> 00:14:54.404
- Looks like they've chickened out.
- They're here.

203
00:14:55.903 --> 00:14:57.002
They're here.

204
00:15:01.197 --> 00:15:02.796
That's nice of them
to show up isn't it?

205
00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:13.685
A hundred says
the Indian comes last.

206
00:15:13.985 --> 00:15:15.183
Right.

207
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:38.960
Come on, Burt.

208
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:42.556
Ready, steady...

209
00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:45.153
go.

210
00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:51.347
Come on, give me a push.

211
00:15:53.145 --> 00:15:54.844
- Come on.
- Come on, Burt.

212
00:15:55.044 --> 00:15:57.541
Give me a push.
Come on, push hard.

213
00:16:00.138 --> 00:16:01.237
Bugger it.

214
00:16:04.035 --> 00:16:05.034
Bugger it.

215
00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.130
Come on! Go!

216
00:16:52.186 --> 00:16:53.185
Bugger!

217
00:16:53.485 --> 00:16:55.083
Nice bike, granddad.

218
00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:56.682
Loser.

219
00:17:15.063 --> 00:17:16.262
Thanks, fellas.

220
00:17:16.362 --> 00:17:18.860
- Better luck next time.
- Better luck, Burt.

221
00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:25.253
There you go.

222
00:17:25.653 --> 00:17:27.451
- Well, thanks, love.
- Careful, it's hot.

223
00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:32.746
Well, at least I gave them
a good run for their money.

224
00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:34.844
On the downward leg anyway.

225
00:17:35.943 --> 00:17:39.439
Burt... What's it going to cost
to get over to America?

226
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.937
Sorry, love.
What did you say?

227
00:17:40.938 --> 00:17:42.936
How much is it gonna cost
to get over to America?

228
00:17:43.735 --> 00:17:46.732
I don't know,
about two thousand I'm told.

229
00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:49.329
And how much money
have you got now?

230
00:17:50.728 --> 00:17:55.223
Apart from today's disaster and
the dough from last night and...

231
00:17:55.224 --> 00:17:58.320
the pension money
I've been saving...

232
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.515
...about twelve hundred and 75 dollars,
United States dollars, I reckon.

233
00:18:04.414 --> 00:18:06.312
Well, I could lend you some money.

234
00:18:06.512 --> 00:18:11.407
That's very kind of you Fran love, but no.
I couldn't do that love. No, thanks.

235
00:18:11.607 --> 00:18:13.805
Well, there must be
something you can do.

236
00:18:14.404 --> 00:18:17.201
Well, I haven't told anyone
else this, Fran, but...

237
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:22.096
I don't reckon I'll be going to Bonneville.
I mean not this year anyway and...

238
00:18:22.796 --> 00:18:26.592
you know, seven hundred dollars
is a lot of money to find...

239
00:18:26.892 --> 00:18:31.087
and the boat leaves in five days.

240
00:18:33.185 --> 00:18:37.681
Except I would like to see
how fast she would really go...

241
00:18:37.781 --> 00:18:42.975
before I fall off the perch as it were.
Before I ah, kicked the old bucket.

242
00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:54.864
Hello, Lloyd.

243
00:18:55.263 --> 00:18:56.562
Gidday, Burt.

244
00:18:56.762 --> 00:18:57.761
Shame about the fall.

245
00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.859
Well, I'm still
in one piece aren't I?

246
00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:02.355
What are you having tonight?

247
00:19:02.356 --> 00:19:04.754
Specialty of the house,
pea, pie and pud.

248
00:19:04.953 --> 00:19:06.552
- That's five bob.
- Alright.

249
00:19:06.951 --> 00:19:10.448
Burt? Why don't you take out
a mortgage on your house?

250
00:19:10.648 --> 00:19:12.446
- What house?
- Well, your property.

251
00:19:12.546 --> 00:19:14.444
I mean it's worth something.

252
00:19:16.442 --> 00:19:17.640
Here you are.

253
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:19.938
Burt Munro,
look at the colour of your hands.

254
00:19:20.038 --> 00:19:22.636
- What's the matter with them.
- You're gonna wash those mitts...

255
00:19:22.637 --> 00:19:24.434
before you put them
anywhere near me.

256
00:19:24.734 --> 00:19:26.032
There we are.

257
00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:00.897
Wakee, wakee.

258
00:20:01.697 --> 00:20:03.195
Time to rise...

259
00:20:04.194 --> 00:20:05.693
and shine.

260
00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:09.089
Burt, you're a sweetie.

261
00:20:09.888 --> 00:20:12.686
Got to get out of here before
the neighbours spot me.

262
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.977
Burt, this tastes a bit odd.

263
00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:23.175
Metallic!

264
00:20:24.574 --> 00:20:28.370
<i>You are my sunshine
My only sunshine</i>

265
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.669
Oh, crikey!

266
00:20:30.168 --> 00:20:31.367
What?

267
00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:33.065
I've got a pain in my chest.

268
00:20:34.564 --> 00:20:36.362
He's in the shed, hurry.

269
00:20:40.857 --> 00:20:43.355
Mum, Dad,
something's happened to Burt.

270
00:20:51.047 --> 00:20:52.646
Burt, what's wrong with you?

271
00:20:52.845 --> 00:20:55.143
I'll be alright Tommy,
don't worry about me.

272
00:20:55.743 --> 00:20:57.541
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

273
00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:22.815
What are you all staring at?
Dirty old men need love too.

274
00:21:27.211 --> 00:21:28.909
- Mr. Munro.
- Hello.

275
00:21:29.109 --> 00:21:31.607
So, what's the story, Doc?

276
00:21:31.906 --> 00:21:36.002
- I'm sorry, it's not good news.
- Oh, yeah. Well, fire away.

277
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:39.399
You've had an attack of angina.

278
00:21:40.598 --> 00:21:42.396
You have arterial sclerosis.

279
00:21:43.195 --> 00:21:44.494
And what's that?

280
00:21:44.793 --> 00:21:47.391
It's a narrowing
of the arteries from the heart.

281
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:48.590
Oh, dear.

282
00:21:48.889 --> 00:21:51.087
Yeah, I'm afraid there's not too much
we can do for you at your age...

283
00:21:51.187 --> 00:21:53.285
other than suggesting you
take it easy.

284
00:21:54.484 --> 00:21:57.681
Look if you have another attack,
pop one of these under your tongue...

285
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.078
let it dissolve
and then swallow the saliva.

286
00:22:00.178 --> 00:22:02.676
The pain should be gone
in thirty seconds.

287
00:22:02.875 --> 00:22:05.573
- Yeah, what do you call these things?
- Trinitrate pills.

288
00:22:06.372 --> 00:22:08.370
Um better known as nitro glycerine.

289
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.066
- The stuff you blow things up with.
- Yes, but in much smaller quantities.

290
00:22:12.067 --> 00:22:13.065
Alright.

291
00:22:14.564 --> 00:22:18.060
Will this have any affect on
me riding my bike?

292
00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:23.455
Unfortunately, I think your
motorcycling days are over.

293
00:22:23.754 --> 00:22:24.753
Like hell they are.

294
00:22:39.439 --> 00:22:40.737
It won't be much longer.

295
00:22:49.229 --> 00:22:50.528
Springfield.

296
00:22:51.726 --> 00:22:55.523
Springfield.
That's where the Indians come from.

297
00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:58.220
- Indians?
- Yeah, the Indians...

298
00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:00.717
from Springfield,
Massachusetts.

299
00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:03.615
The world's greatest
motorcycle.

300
00:23:04.614 --> 00:23:06.312
- Is that so?
- That's right.

301
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.108
- You can come through now.
- Alright, thank you.

302
00:23:11.007 --> 00:23:12.805
Yeah, Springfield.

303
00:23:14.903 --> 00:23:18.100
<i>The plan is for me
to drive up to Timaru and...</i>

304
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.295
there me and my bike...
will catch a boat to the US of A to...

305
00:23:23.395 --> 00:23:26.791
Los Angeles,
and the boat leaves on Saturday.

306
00:23:26.991 --> 00:23:29.589
And I'll buy a car
in Los Angeles...

307
00:23:29.688 --> 00:23:32.286
and drive up to Utah,
to the Bonneville Salt Flats.

308
00:23:32.486 --> 00:23:35.782
- It's really important you do this trip?
- Sure is mate, you know.

309
00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:40.278
Ever since I was a lad I've been
interested in things that go fast...

310
00:23:40.478 --> 00:23:42.376
you know things
that roll and go and...

311
00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:46.072
at Bonneville things go real fast.
It's...

312
00:23:46.372 --> 00:23:49.668
this giant dried up lake bed...

313
00:23:49.868 --> 00:23:52.565
and it goes for miles
and miles and it's dead flat...

314
00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:56.562
and you can drive a vehicle just
as fast as it will go and it's...

315
00:23:56.861 --> 00:23:59.857
...one of the few places
on earth...

316
00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:04.054
where you can find out just what
your machine is capable of.

317
00:24:04.354 --> 00:24:08.849
In fact here I'm on the, that's me on the
front of the New Zealand Motorcyclist.

318
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:10.448
That's the Indian there.

319
00:24:10.548 --> 00:24:12.645
- Very good!
- Yeah, a few years ago.

320
00:24:13.045 --> 00:24:14.642
So I'd best be off soon...

321
00:24:14.643 --> 00:24:17.241
because I don't know how much longer
I've got to live you see.

322
00:24:17.242 --> 00:24:19.637
Yes, I don't think
I heard that last statement.

323
00:24:19.638 --> 00:24:21.836
I said I don't know
how much longer I've got to live.

324
00:24:21.837 --> 00:24:23.435
I heard you the first time.

325
00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:25.433
So... tell me, Burt.

326
00:24:25.632 --> 00:24:28.530
What are you offering
as collateral for this loan?

327
00:24:28.629 --> 00:24:33.225
Well, my tools, my bits and pieces, my
trophies and a lot of things like this.

328
00:24:33.226 --> 00:24:36.322
Well, I don't think they'd be
of much interest to the bank...

329
00:24:36.323 --> 00:24:38.520
I think we'd be looking for
something more substantial.

330
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.517
Something like the deed
of title to your property.

331
00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:47.211
- Did you get the money?
- Yep, I'm off on Thursday.

332
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.508
Thursday? That soon?
I wish I could come too.

333
00:24:51.307 --> 00:24:52.605
Oh, maybe next time.

334
00:24:54.903 --> 00:24:57.900
Thomas. It's dinner time.
Come home now.

335
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.197
- Nearly finished, Mrs. Jackson.
- Yeah, Mum, we're almost finished.

336
00:25:03.894 --> 00:25:05.393
See you after dinner, Burt.

337
00:25:06.192 --> 00:25:07.491
Alright, lad.

338
00:25:15.582 --> 00:25:17.281
Hey, not so fast.

339
00:25:17.481 --> 00:25:19.079
I'm the record breaker.

340
00:25:21.976 --> 00:25:23.275
Where are you going?

341
00:25:25.073 --> 00:25:26.771
And that's the...

342
00:25:27.271 --> 00:25:30.468
before I put the...
you know, the streamliner on it.

343
00:25:34.663 --> 00:25:35.662
What's that one?

344
00:25:36.462 --> 00:25:40.757
That's a girlfriend of mine
when I first bought the bike.

345
00:25:40.857 --> 00:25:42.456
It was a long time ago that was.

346
00:25:45.453 --> 00:25:48.450
Aren't you scared you'll kill
yourself if you crash?

347
00:25:48.749 --> 00:25:49.648
No...

348
00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:51.845
you...

349
00:25:51.846 --> 00:25:55.343
live more in five minutes
on a bike like this...

350
00:25:55.642 --> 00:25:58.240
going flat out than some people
live in a lifetime.

351
00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.736
And...

352
00:26:00.737 --> 00:26:04.933
yeah, more in five minutes.
That's my Dad there.

353
00:26:06.132 --> 00:26:07.630
And my mum.

354
00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:10.527
They're all gone.

355
00:26:12.725 --> 00:26:14.723
God, it's gone by so fast!

356
00:26:15.622 --> 00:26:18.519
You know,
danger is the spice of life...

357
00:26:18.719 --> 00:26:21.816
and you've got to take a risk every now
and again haven't you, son?

358
00:26:22.116 --> 00:26:25.213
You know that's
what makes life worthwhile.

359
00:26:26.312 --> 00:26:30.108
And you know,
having some nice ladies around...

360
00:26:30.408 --> 00:26:32.605
...can be a big help, mind you.

361
00:26:33.205 --> 00:26:36.501
- You really don't get scared?
- No, no.

362
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.099
You know...

363
00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:42.196
when I was a boy
about your age...

364
00:26:42.495 --> 00:26:45.492
I had a little twin brother
whose name was Ernie...

365
00:26:45.692 --> 00:26:50.088
and one day our Dad was out
the back cutting down a tree...

366
00:26:50.887 --> 00:26:51.886
and...

367
00:26:52.685 --> 00:26:57.580
suddenly it got hung up, the tree
that is, it got stuck on something and...

368
00:26:58.579 --> 00:27:01.876
Ernie went to go and help.
All of a sudden the tree...

369
00:27:02.376 --> 00:27:06.372
slipped and fell on him
and killed him stone dead.

370
00:27:11.866 --> 00:27:13.764
I always remember that.

371
00:27:14.064 --> 00:27:18.959
Anyway, since then I've always tried
never to be scared of anything.

372
00:27:19.458 --> 00:27:20.856
Although I must say before...

373
00:27:20.857 --> 00:27:24.154
a big bike event I do
sometimes get nervous, you know...

374
00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:30.348
if the butterflies
in my stomach were cows...

375
00:27:30.647 --> 00:27:33.644
I'd be able to start
a dairy farm.

376
00:27:35.043 --> 00:27:36.441
That's funny.

377
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.636
When they took you off in the ambulance
to the hospital. What happened?

378
00:27:41.936 --> 00:27:44.533
I don't know, just a touch
of indigestion I think.

379
00:27:44.933 --> 00:27:48.429
Yeah, that's all it was. There's nothing
wrong with me, don't you worry about me.

380
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:50.228
And anyway at my age...

381
00:27:50.527 --> 00:27:54.124
any day above ground
and vertical is a good day.

382
00:27:54.723 --> 00:27:57.820
Listen, you take care
of this until I get back alright?

383
00:27:58.419 --> 00:28:02.316
- What happens if you don't come back?
- We'll talk about that then shan't we.

384
00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:06.410
- Hey, Burt?
- Yeah.

385
00:28:06.411 --> 00:28:08.310
Don't forget
to mow your lawns will you?

386
00:28:08.409 --> 00:28:10.607
- What?
- Don't forget to mow your lawns.

387
00:28:10.707 --> 00:28:12.505
My Dad goes on and on about it.

388
00:28:12.705 --> 00:28:13.804
He does, does he?

389
00:28:14.004 --> 00:28:17.101
He says it lowers the property
values of the neighbourhood.

390
00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:21.696
Well, oh dear,
we can't have that can we?

391
00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:46.272
What are you doing?

392
00:28:46.571 --> 00:28:48.869
Hello, son.
I'm just getting rid of the grass.

393
00:28:51.766 --> 00:28:54.463
Burt, what the hell
are you doing this time?

394
00:28:54.763 --> 00:28:57.860
Oh, like you said George
I'm getting rid of the grass...

395
00:28:58.359 --> 00:29:00.957
being a good neighbour
before I leave tomorrow.

396
00:29:01.257 --> 00:29:03.654
Tom, Tom!
Get back inside now!

397
00:29:04.453 --> 00:29:05.652
Now!

398
00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:08.449
Honestly, Burt!

399
00:29:12.645 --> 00:29:15.442
- What are they doing here?
- It might be the fire, Burt.

400
00:29:24.433 --> 00:29:26.331
Right, the tyre goes in first.

401
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:28.329
That's it.

402
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:31.326
That's it, Jeff. You've got it.

403
00:29:32.026 --> 00:29:33.524
This goes in here.

404
00:29:35.322 --> 00:29:36.621
Pills...

405
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.819
license, passport.

406
00:29:39.818 --> 00:29:42.315
Right, let's see,
I've got everything?

407
00:29:43.215 --> 00:29:46.711
Spectacles, testicles,
watch and wallet.

408
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:48.309
What are you laughing at?

409
00:29:48.609 --> 00:29:49.808
I'm on my way.

410
00:29:50.008 --> 00:29:52.405
- Dad says to call us collect.
- What?

411
00:29:52.505 --> 00:29:54.104
Dad says to call us collect.

412
00:29:54.503 --> 00:29:56.601
- That's nice of him.
- Tell us how you get on.

413
00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.299
Thank you.

414
00:29:58.499 --> 00:29:59.998
That's our phone number.

415
00:30:01.396 --> 00:30:04.793
- Do you think you'll break the record?
- Well, I hope so.

416
00:30:05.592 --> 00:30:07.590
Dad doesn't think
you can do it.

417
00:30:09.688 --> 00:30:11.087
Is that what he said?

418
00:30:11.586 --> 00:30:13.384
He said everyone thinks that.

419
00:30:14.084 --> 00:30:15.282
Well...

420
00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:17.780
Except me.

421
00:30:23.175 --> 00:30:25.572
You're a good boy, Tom.

422
00:30:29.868 --> 00:30:31.666
I'll tell you something, son.

423
00:30:31.966 --> 00:30:35.862
If you don't follow through on your
dreams, you might as well be a vegetable.

424
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.358
What type of vegetable?

425
00:30:39.758 --> 00:30:41.057
I don't know...

426
00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:42.655
a cabbage.

427
00:30:43.754 --> 00:30:44.953
Yeah...

428
00:30:45.153 --> 00:30:46.451
<i>a cabbage.</i>

429
00:30:48.349 --> 00:30:50.397
There you are.
Don't lose it, will you?

430
00:30:50.398 --> 00:30:52.445
- I promise I'll look after it.
- Right.

431
00:30:54.643 --> 00:30:57.640
So keep an eye on the place
for me won't you, Tom.

432
00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.139
And...

433
00:31:00.737 --> 00:31:02.635
don't forget
to feed the fowls.

434
00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:04.233
- That's my job.
- Yeah.

435
00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:05.431
And...

436
00:31:05.432 --> 00:31:08.629
you can give
the eggs to Mum and...

437
00:31:08.929 --> 00:31:10.427
what else is there?

438
00:31:11.226 --> 00:31:12.225
Oh, yes...

439
00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:17.121
you can pee on my lemon tree
for me if you like, while I'm away.

440
00:31:17.121 --> 00:31:20.018
And there's nothing wrong
with peeing on your lemon tree...

441
00:31:20.118 --> 00:31:24.014
as Confucius used to say, it's the best
natural fertilizer in the world.

442
00:31:24.213 --> 00:31:26.711
- Who's Confucius?
- He's some bloke who lives up in Dunedin.

443
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.809
Thanks for you help, chaps.

444
00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:30.607
- Good luck, Burt.
- Thanks, Jeff.

445
00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:33.304
- You show them over there in the States.
- I will.

446
00:31:33.504 --> 00:31:34.503
Take it easy, Burt.

447
00:31:34.603 --> 00:31:37.200
That's not one of the things
I'm planning on doing, George.

448
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.549
Cheerio, love.

449
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.798
Good luck.

450
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.196
Cheerio, my friend.

451
00:31:41.596 --> 00:31:44.293
If you don't go when you wanna go
when you do go, you'll find you're gone.

452
00:31:44.393 --> 00:31:45.892
- I'll see ya.
- See ya, Burt.

453
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:47.590
Bye, Burt.

454
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.488
- Good luck.
- Cheerio.

455
00:31:50.187 --> 00:31:50.987
See ya, Burt.

456
00:32:04.573 --> 00:32:05.472
Look at that!

457
00:32:15.762 --> 00:32:19.258
Well, Fran,
I'm finally on my way.

458
00:32:22.755 --> 00:32:26.151
I thought some more
of the blokes from the club...

459
00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:28.549
would have dropped
by to see me off.

460
00:32:29.148 --> 00:32:31.546
Well, they probably had
to work today.

461
00:32:31.846 --> 00:32:33.444
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

462
00:32:34.443 --> 00:32:36.941
Yeah, young Tom tells me...

463
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.838
that no one thinks
I can do it.

464
00:32:40.337 --> 00:32:43.834
- Do you think I can do it, Fran?
- I don't know, Burt.

465
00:32:44.034 --> 00:32:46.231
I don't think it really matters
one way or the other.

466
00:32:52.225 --> 00:32:54.823
You know, I read something once,
years ago.

467
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:58.020
I learnt it off by heart.

468
00:32:59.318 --> 00:33:02.515
It was Theodore Roosevelt
said it...

469
00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:07.410
it's not
the critic that counts...

470
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.806
not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles...

471
00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:16.801
or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better.

472
00:33:19.098 --> 00:33:23.194
The credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena.

473
00:33:32.485 --> 00:33:34.483
Wind your window down!
Down.

474
00:33:34.683 --> 00:33:36.081
What?

475
00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:37.979
Some beer money.

476
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.177
- What?
- Some beer money.

477
00:33:41.076 --> 00:33:42.575
I don't drink.

478
00:33:43.474 --> 00:33:45.072
Good luck.

479
00:33:45.272 --> 00:33:46.571
- You go well.
- Thanks, mate.

480
00:33:46.771 --> 00:33:48.269
You show 'em Kiwis can fly.

481
00:33:48.369 --> 00:33:51.366
Yeah, I'll bring you back
the Statue of Liberty.

482
00:33:52.065 --> 00:33:53.364
Good on you mate,
thanks a lot.

483
00:34:11.946 --> 00:34:13.544
Hey, not so fast!

484
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:17.140
Crikey!

485
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.237
Take it easy, mate!

486
00:34:22.835 --> 00:34:24.233
I thought it was a goner.

487
00:34:31.626 --> 00:34:32.925
Better get going.

488
00:34:32.925 --> 00:34:34.223
Yeah, alright...

489
00:34:34.823 --> 00:34:37.520
take care of the old jalopy,
won't you?

490
00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:41.015
- You look after yourself.
- I will.

491
00:34:41.016 --> 00:34:42.715
You've got your pills
and everything, right?

492
00:34:42.716 --> 00:34:44.613
Yeah, yeah, right as rain.

493
00:34:49.508 --> 00:34:52.505
- You come back in one piece.
- I will, cheerio.

494
00:35:02.695 --> 00:35:03.993
Where's the Captain?

495
00:35:04.093 --> 00:35:05.392
Down below.

496
00:35:05.592 --> 00:35:07.390
- Down the gangway there.
- Thanks.

497
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:09.987
There we are.

498
00:35:10.287 --> 00:35:12.185
I'm looking for the Captain.

499
00:35:12.685 --> 00:35:13.884
That's me.

500
00:35:15.082 --> 00:35:17.080
My name's Burt Munro.

501
00:35:19.878 --> 00:35:23.674
I'm supposed to do a job to work
my passage to Los Angeles.

502
00:35:23.874 --> 00:35:26.271
- Yeah, well, I hope you can cook.
- Cook?

503
00:35:28.469 --> 00:35:30.467
- I'll give it a go.
- There's the galley.

504
00:35:35.162 --> 00:35:35.961
Crikey!

505
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.759
Who does the dishes, mate?

506
00:35:39.458 --> 00:35:40.557
You.

507
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:47.450
Smells good.

508
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.348
What do you have
for us today, Burt?

509
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:51.446
It's good Kiwi tucker.

510
00:35:54.043 --> 00:35:56.541
Don't let Burt see you
doing that.

511
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.638
Here, don't spoil it
with all that sauce.

512
00:36:00.137 --> 00:36:01.836
- Sorry, Burt.
- Stone the crows!

513
00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.628
Are you going to watch
the movie, Burt?

514
00:36:08.629 --> 00:36:11.326
- What's that?
- Are you going to watch the movie?

515
00:36:12.425 --> 00:36:14.723
- What's it called?
- Broken Barrier.

516
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:19.318
- It's supposed to be good.
- Is Jane Russell in it?

517
00:36:20.017 --> 00:36:21.915
There's a spare seat
over here, Burt.

518
00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:30.707
Smoke?

519
00:36:31.006 --> 00:36:33.404
- No. Not for me, mate.
- You don't smoke Burt?

520
00:36:33.405 --> 00:36:35.802
No, I don't
and that's why people say to me...

521
00:36:36.101 --> 00:36:37.949
how do you keep going
at your age, Burt...

522
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.797
and I say,
well because I don't smoke...

523
00:36:39.798 --> 00:36:42.595
so I'm telling you young monkeys,
don't smoke.

524
00:36:43.194 --> 00:36:45.991
You can laugh,
but my Dad said...

525
00:36:46.191 --> 00:36:48.389
why contaminate your lungs
with tobacco smoke?

526
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:51.686
The only thing you accomplish with
smoking is destroying your lungs...

527
00:36:51.687 --> 00:36:54.283
- and shortening your life.
- Kill the lights.

528
00:36:58.179 --> 00:36:59.278
Is Jane Russell in this?

529
00:37:00.477 --> 00:37:01.776
Go well, Burt.

530
00:37:03.174 --> 00:37:05.172
- Thanks, mate.

531
00:37:11.965 --> 00:37:13.564
- Good luck to you, Burt.
- Thanks.

532
00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:15.562
Remember what I said.
Don't smoke.

533
00:37:16.361 --> 00:37:17.360
I'm trying.

534
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.058
Cheerio, mates. See ya.

535
00:37:20.657 --> 00:37:22.954
Welcome to the United States.
Customs to the left.

536
00:37:23.054 --> 00:37:24.653
Thank you, good to be here.

537
00:37:25.152 --> 00:37:26.151
G'day.

538
00:37:32.645 --> 00:37:33.644
G'day.

539
00:37:33.943 --> 00:37:36.441
Please, stand behind the yellow line
until you are called, sir.

540
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:37.540
What's that?

541
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.137
- Behind the yellow line.
- Yellow line?

542
00:37:50.327 --> 00:37:51.326
G'day.

543
00:37:51.426 --> 00:37:53.923
Passport and customs declaration,
please sir.

544
00:37:55.222 --> 00:37:56.521
There you are.

545
00:38:01.915 --> 00:38:04.113
How long do you intend
to stay in the United States?

546
00:38:04.313 --> 00:38:08.509
However long it takes me to get
to Bonneville and back.

547
00:38:08.709 --> 00:38:10.706
And the purpose of your visit?

548
00:38:10.707 --> 00:38:14.103
To set a land speed record
on my Indian.

549
00:38:15.202 --> 00:38:16.101
Indian?

550
00:38:16.601 --> 00:38:17.700
Mr. Munro...

551
00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:19.997
- So this is your first time to America?
- Yes, sir.

552
00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:22.894
You gave some rather odd answers
to the Officer...

553
00:38:23.194 --> 00:38:24.992
so we just have a few further
questions we'd like to ask you.

554
00:38:25.092 --> 00:38:28.788
- Well, fire away.
- Well, let's go over again what you said.

555
00:38:29.188 --> 00:38:31.885
Now what exactly do you intend to do
here in the United States?

556
00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:33.983
Well, set a land speed record.

557
00:38:35.082 --> 00:38:38.179
- And how do you intend to do that, sir?
- On my motorcycle.

558
00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:41.775
It's in the hold of the ship
at the moment and...

559
00:38:41.975 --> 00:38:46.671
they're going to unload it tomorrow.
It's an Indian, a 1920 Indian Scout...

560
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.068
modified somewhat.

561
00:38:50.067 --> 00:38:50.966
You know what?

562
00:38:51.566 --> 00:38:53.863
- I think I've read about your bike.
- Yeah?

563
00:38:54.063 --> 00:38:57.160
Yeah, it was in Popular Mechanics,
a couple of years ago.

564
00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.958
That's right, that's me.

565
00:38:59.158 --> 00:39:02.355
A Leslie Hobbs from Christchurch
sent that story.

566
00:39:02.555 --> 00:39:05.352
What was it?
Fastest motorcycle in Australia?

567
00:39:05.552 --> 00:39:07.350
Yeah, and in New Zealand.

568
00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:11.845
Well, I guess you're legitimate,
Mr. Munro.

569
00:39:12.145 --> 00:39:14.842
It sounds like we should be very
honoured to have you here in America.

570
00:39:15.042 --> 00:39:17.540
- Well, thank you.
- We're going to give you six months...

571
00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:19.737
that should be time enough
to get the job done.

572
00:39:21.935 --> 00:39:24.233
- Welcome to the USA.
- Thank you very much.

573
00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:26.131
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

574
00:39:33.424 --> 00:39:34.922
- Gears in the trunk.
- What?

575
00:39:35.122 --> 00:39:36.521
Bags in the back.

576
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.419
Bag, back!

577
00:39:38.519 --> 00:39:41.516
Don't worry about me,
I'll do it myself.

578
00:39:42.015 --> 00:39:43.314
Strewth!

579
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.599
Sit in the back, in the back!

580
00:39:58.898 --> 00:40:00.896
- What?
- You, in the back!

581
00:40:02.495 --> 00:40:06.291
Tell you something, mate,
you don't want to get old around here.

582
00:40:09.288 --> 00:40:10.487
Ta ra.

583
00:40:13.084 --> 00:40:14.682
- Where to?
- What?

584
00:40:14.982 --> 00:40:17.379
- Where to?
- Hollywood.

585
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.776
Yeah, I want to go to Hollywood,
I want to see the film stars.

586
00:40:21.176 --> 00:40:23.374
Okay, we go to Hollywood.

587
00:40:23.773 --> 00:40:25.372
Where in Hollywood?

588
00:40:26.071 --> 00:40:29.568
A motel on Sunset Boulevard...

589
00:40:30.267 --> 00:40:32.065
I hear that's a pretty great street.

590
00:40:32.265 --> 00:40:35.262
I don't know who you talking to lately.
Which motel?

591
00:40:36.561 --> 00:40:38.059
Recommend one.

592
00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:40.856
Come on man, what do you think
I am, an encyclopaedia?

593
00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:44.752
Drop me somewhere
and I'll sort it out myself.

594
00:40:52.944 --> 00:40:55.142
Must have a bit
electricity bill here.

595
00:40:59.438 --> 00:41:00.736
Firestone...

596
00:41:01.735 --> 00:41:02.734
Shell.

597
00:41:04.732 --> 00:41:08.529
It's all about cars, isn't it?
I've never seen so many cars.

598
00:41:08.928 --> 00:41:12.525
- You say something, man?
- I said I've never seen so many cars.

599
00:41:12.824 --> 00:41:15.222
Got to get around somehow.

600
00:41:20.017 --> 00:41:23.114
Look, there's a bowling alley.
Do you bowl?

601
00:41:29.308 --> 00:41:31.306
What's he honking his horn about?

602
00:41:34.602 --> 00:41:37.000
Jesus!
Crikey, did you see that?

603
00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:40.097
That blokes backing into that
geaser's car.

604
00:41:40.996 --> 00:41:42.495
He's crazy, he's nuts.

605
00:41:43.394 --> 00:41:44.992
He did it again.

606
00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:48.688
Don't stare, there's a lot of
crazy people in this town.

607
00:41:48.988 --> 00:41:50.786
I've never seen anything
like that before.

608
00:42:01.875 --> 00:42:03.973
- This should do...
- What's the damage?

609
00:42:04.672 --> 00:42:06.071
28 dollar, plus bag...

610
00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:08.269
- 29 dollar.
- What?

611
00:42:09.767 --> 00:42:12.564
Did you just say
what I thought you said?

612
00:42:12.664 --> 00:42:14.862
- Are you deaf?
- What?

613
00:42:14.962 --> 00:42:18.359
- Are you deaf?
- Yeah, I am a bit deaf, but I'm not stupid.

614
00:42:18.459 --> 00:42:21.356
- How much did you say it was?
- 29 dollar.

615
00:42:21.555 --> 00:42:25.951
No, I don't want to buy the cab, mate.
I just want to pay the fare, that's all.

616
00:42:25.952 --> 00:42:27.649
- Where you from?
- What?

617
00:42:27.849 --> 00:42:30.946
- You a British?
- No, you must be joking...

618
00:42:31.146 --> 00:42:33.444
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from New Zealand.

619
00:42:33.643 --> 00:42:35.042
Well, this is America.

620
00:42:35.941 --> 00:42:38.838
And the fare, right there on the meter,
29 dollar.

621
00:42:39.238 --> 00:42:41.835
Open your wallet
and let the moths out.

622
00:42:42.035 --> 00:42:43.434
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

623
00:42:44.033 --> 00:42:46.630
There you go, 29 dollars.

624
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.728
- No, don't forget the tip.
- What?

625
00:42:48.928 --> 00:42:51.226
Yes, we tip in America.

626
00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:52.325
Ten percent.

627
00:42:52.425 --> 00:42:54.223
- How much?
- Ten percent.

628
00:42:56.121 --> 00:42:57.619
Oh yeah, there you go, ten cents.

629
00:43:06.311 --> 00:43:07.809
Excuse me, sir.

630
00:43:08.009 --> 00:43:10.107
- You look like a generous man, sir.
- What?

631
00:43:10.307 --> 00:43:12.105
- You look like a generous man.
- Oh do I?

632
00:43:12.305 --> 00:43:15.601
Yes you do. Would you like to buy
a flower to give to someone special?

633
00:43:15.901 --> 00:43:17.899
Well,
sorry I don't have any cash.

634
00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:20.397
Don't worry,
the money goes to a good cause.

635
00:43:20.596 --> 00:43:23.194
It's for an organization
that helps needy people.

636
00:43:23.493 --> 00:43:25.392
Oh alright, well, how much is it?

637
00:43:25.691 --> 00:43:27.989
- Just give what you can afford.
- Alright, well.

638
00:43:29.887 --> 00:43:31.984
They all look the same to me.
They're all green.

639
00:43:31.985 --> 00:43:34.682
- Yes, that's why we call them greenbacks.
- That looks like a one.

640
00:43:34.982 --> 00:43:36.381
- Look there's one.
- No, that's a ten.

641
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.279
- Thanks, you have a good day.
- No, that's a ten.

642
00:43:38.478 --> 00:43:40.377
Hey come on miss, that's a ten.

643
00:43:40.776 --> 00:43:41.975
I didn't want to pay that much.

644
00:43:42.275 --> 00:43:43.673
Hey, come back.

645
00:43:47.568 --> 00:43:48.567
Crikey.

646
00:43:48.568 --> 00:43:50.067
- Hey baby.
- What do you want?

647
00:43:50.267 --> 00:43:51.565
- You wanna go?
- Go where?

648
00:43:52.764 --> 00:43:55.162
- Go inside.
- I'm going inside.

649
00:43:55.961 --> 00:43:57.859
I'll take you around the world.

650
00:43:58.059 --> 00:43:59.857
I've just come from halfway
around the world.

651
00:43:59.957 --> 00:44:01.655
15 bucks, baby.

652
00:44:01.656 --> 00:44:02.954
15 bucks.

653
00:44:03.154 --> 00:44:04.952
No, sorry, go away.

654
00:44:12.145 --> 00:44:13.044
Hello.

655
00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:21.435
- I need a room.
- A room will cost you five bucks an hour.

656
00:44:21.436 --> 00:44:23.533
I'm planning on staying
a wee bit longer than that.

657
00:44:23.633 --> 00:44:26.331
- How long?
- I don't know, a couple of days I guess.

658
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.528
- Double occupancy?
- What?

659
00:44:28.828 --> 00:44:30.227
Double occupancy?

660
00:44:30.426 --> 00:44:32.824
No, just me, myself and I.

661
00:44:33.623 --> 00:44:36.820
Will it cost a lot because
I can't afford a lot.

662
00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:40.217
- You a member of Triple A?
- What?

663
00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:42.814
- Are you a Triple A member?
- Never heard of them.

664
00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:44.313
Never heard of Triple A?

665
00:44:44.512 --> 00:44:47.809
No Miss Brittle Britches,
I have not heard of Triple A.

666
00:44:49.308 --> 00:44:51.306
Okay, let's just say
you are a member, doll.

667
00:44:51.306 --> 00:44:53.304
- Alright.
- That'll save you ten percent.

668
00:44:54.602 --> 00:44:56.600
How does 22 bucks a night sound?

669
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.098
That much? Is that cheap?

670
00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:01.595
Honey, that's cheaper than cheap.

671
00:45:04.892 --> 00:45:07.789
- What's your name?
- Tina Washington.

672
00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:09.287
Well, Tina Washington,

673
00:45:09.288 --> 00:45:11.885
I want you to have this,
it might cheer you up a bit.

674
00:45:12.185 --> 00:45:14.283
Get some of that muck
off your pluck.

675
00:45:14.782 --> 00:45:16.081
Well, thank you.

676
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.978
That's the first nice thing
that's happened round here all week.

677
00:45:18.979 --> 00:45:20.376
You're welcome.

678
00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:23.673
My name's Burt Munro.
From New Zealand.

679
00:45:23.773 --> 00:45:25.272
I'm from down under.

680
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:27.569
Well, hello, Burt Munro
from New Zealand down under.

681
00:45:27.869 --> 00:45:29.967
I tell you,
I've had a heck of a night.

682
00:45:30.666 --> 00:45:32.265
Welcome to Hollyweird.

683
00:46:24.113 --> 00:46:25.511
Hello?

684
00:46:25.811 --> 00:46:27.010
Anybody home?

685
00:46:29.108 --> 00:46:31.106
- Hello, Tina.
- Good morning, Burt.

686
00:46:31.405 --> 00:46:32.904
You still here?

687
00:46:34.203 --> 00:46:37.100
That's why you were
so crabby last night.

688
00:46:37.299 --> 00:46:38.598
Don't you ever get any sleep?

689
00:46:38.898 --> 00:46:40.396
I work a night shift.

690
00:46:40.596 --> 00:46:43.094
I'm out of here as soon as James
turns up and he's late.

691
00:46:44.292 --> 00:46:47.389
Yeah, could you phone
this number for me?

692
00:46:47.789 --> 00:46:51.186
Yeah, it's a shipping company
and they've got a big box of mine...

693
00:46:51.485 --> 00:46:54.682
and I want to know how
to arrange to get it.

694
00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.078
No, you talk to them,
they'll never get my accent.

695
00:46:59.277 --> 00:47:01.775
Okay, what do you want me
to ask them? One moment please.

696
00:47:01.875 --> 00:47:06.570
Ask them when a Burt Munro's box
containing the motorcycle...

697
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:07.769
will be ready for pick up.

698
00:47:08.568 --> 00:47:11.066
Hello, I'm calling
for Mr. Burt Munro.

699
00:47:11.166 --> 00:47:13.963
Yes, he'd like to know when the box
containing his motorcycle...

700
00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:16.061
<i>- will be available for pick up.
- What ship?</i>

701
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.058
- What ship?
- Rangatira from New Zealand.

702
00:47:19.257 --> 00:47:21.355
The Rangatira from New Zealand.

703
00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:23.253
<i>- It's arrived.
- So he can claim it?</i>

704
00:47:25.251 --> 00:47:27.649
Tomorrow from the Long Beach
customs holding area.

705
00:47:27.949 --> 00:47:29.847
Okay, thank you, I'll tell him.
Bye-bye.

706
00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:31.745
That was pretty fast.

707
00:47:32.045 --> 00:47:33.543
You're late.

708
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:39.138
I can't stand another minute in
this place. Let me buy you breakfast.

709
00:47:42.534 --> 00:47:43.833
Well, this is great.

710
00:47:44.232 --> 00:47:47.929
You know, I've never seen
a menu with photographs before.

711
00:47:49.227 --> 00:47:50.726
- Are you ready to order, sir?
- What?

712
00:47:51.026 --> 00:47:52.824
- Are you ready?
- Oh yes...

713
00:47:54.023 --> 00:47:57.719
I think the Double Delight,
that's for me.

714
00:47:58.418 --> 00:48:00.216
- How would you like your eggs?
- What?

715
00:48:00.416 --> 00:48:02.015
How would you like your eggs?

716
00:48:02.814 --> 00:48:04.013
Well, I'd like them cooked.

717
00:48:04.912 --> 00:48:07.809
Sunny side up? Over easy?

718
00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:11.505
- I don't know, whatever you recommend.
- Over easy's best.

719
00:48:12.304 --> 00:48:13.803
Alright, eggs over easy.

720
00:48:14.103 --> 00:48:15.301
Make that two.

721
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:18.298
Over easy.
I must remember that.

722
00:48:18.498 --> 00:48:21.295
Yeah, I like this American
breakfast thing.

723
00:48:21.995 --> 00:48:22.994
It's good.

724
00:48:24.692 --> 00:48:29.088
So my girl, where's the best place
for me to get a used car?

725
00:48:29.287 --> 00:48:30.586
The valley.

726
00:48:31.086 --> 00:48:33.084
After breakfast I could
take you there.

727
00:48:33.183 --> 00:48:34.182
Oh, thank you.

728
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.879
And I'm not a girl.

729
00:48:39.977 --> 00:48:40.976
I'm a boy.

730
00:48:46.071 --> 00:48:48.468
I thought there was something
a little odd about you.

731
00:48:48.469 --> 00:48:51.365
But hey,
you're still a sweetheart.

732
00:48:54.262 --> 00:48:55.161
Yep.

733
00:49:09.347 --> 00:49:10.546
Thanks a million, Tina.

734
00:49:10.846 --> 00:49:12.944
Hey,
there are stacks of cars here.

735
00:49:13.643 --> 00:49:15.941
- I'll be back in the motel later on.
- Bye.

736
00:49:17.139 --> 00:49:18.238
Bye.

737
00:49:22.733 --> 00:49:24.431
Buenos diaz!

738
00:49:24.432 --> 00:49:25.831
How may I help you, sir?

739
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:30.027
Yeah, I want to buy a car,
a cheap car, a very cheap car.

740
00:49:30.027 --> 00:49:32.224
Well, you've come
to the right place, amigo.

741
00:49:32.624 --> 00:49:36.920
In fact, if you can find cars like this
any cheaper, they're probably stolen.

742
00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:40.516
My name's Burt, Burt Munro
from New Zealand. Nice to meet you.

743
00:49:40.816 --> 00:49:43.313
I'm Fernando from El Salvador,
nice to meet you, Mr. Munro.

744
00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:46.011
- You can call me Burt.
- Okay, Mr. Burt.

745
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.807
So how much were you looking
to spend here Mr. Burt?

746
00:49:49.808 --> 00:49:51.105
Not a lot Fernando...

747
00:49:51.405 --> 00:49:54.003
I haven't got much left after
the cab ride I took yesterday.

748
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:57.099
You want 399 for this?

749
00:49:58.098 --> 00:49:59.797
It sounds a bit sick.

750
00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:01.595
Well, what would you offer me?

751
00:50:01.995 --> 00:50:04.892
Listen, I'll give you 200
if you'll do me a favour.

752
00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:08.588
Throw in the use
of your workshop...

753
00:50:08.788 --> 00:50:11.285
and some of that junk
I see lying around...

754
00:50:11.985 --> 00:50:14.682
I've got to knock up
a trailer...

755
00:50:14.982 --> 00:50:17.179
to drag my bike over
to Bonneville.

756
00:50:17.379 --> 00:50:19.377
That's not a favour,
325 is a favour.

757
00:50:19.577 --> 00:50:21.775
No, 225.

758
00:50:22.774 --> 00:50:25.371
You're a tough customer, Mr. Burt,
but I like you...

759
00:50:25.671 --> 00:50:28.968
I'm going to give it to you for 250
and you can use the workshop...

760
00:50:29.067 --> 00:50:31.465
but only at night
and keep the noise down.

761
00:50:31.466 --> 00:50:32.164
What about tonight?

762
00:50:32.564 --> 00:50:34.062
Yeah, yeah, tonight's OK.

763
00:50:34.362 --> 00:50:37.959
Stop the car, let's get
this thing running properly.

764
00:50:51.745 --> 00:50:53.143
There that sounds better.

765
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:58.138
- Let me drive.
- Okay, come on.

766
00:50:58.338 --> 00:51:00.736
She's singing
like a bird now.

767
00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:03.333
Oh, she's a good old girl,
isn't she?

768
00:51:03.533 --> 00:51:04.932
There we are, alright.

769
00:51:11.825 --> 00:51:15.121
- You make a left here, Mr. Burt.
- Alright.

770
00:51:18.918 --> 00:51:21.015
The buggers are in the wrong lane.

771
00:51:21.215 --> 00:51:22.714
Stop the car, stop the car.

772
00:51:24.912 --> 00:51:26.910
Turn, turn, this way.

773
00:51:27.809 --> 00:51:29.407
Stop, stop the car.

774
00:51:31.705 --> 00:51:33.503
Keep your shirt on.

775
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:38.898
- Scoot over, you stupid old bastard.
- Thought I was back in New Zealand...

776
00:51:38.898 --> 00:51:41.495
we drive on the other side
of the road over there.

777
00:51:41.795 --> 00:51:44.192
Yeah? You're going to get
us all killed.

778
00:51:45.691 --> 00:51:48.538
Well, you're not in New Zealand,
you're in America.

779
00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:51.385
- I know it.
- We drive on the right side of the road.

780
00:52:00.876 --> 00:52:03.972
Now, Burt.
Let me give you some advice.

781
00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.768
When you're driving,
not only here in America...

782
00:52:08.868 --> 00:52:10.566
but anywhere's around the world...

783
00:52:10.766 --> 00:52:14.062
the driver should always
be in the centre of the road.

784
00:52:14.462 --> 00:52:17.109
In the centre.
If you're not in the centre...

785
00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.757
you're on the wrong side of the road.
Okay?

786
00:52:29.547 --> 00:52:31.445
You want this right here?

787
00:52:34.642 --> 00:52:35.841
That's it.

788
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.439
Yeah, good.

789
00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:38.937
Got it.

790
00:52:39.437 --> 00:52:41.235
It's 3 am in the morning.

791
00:52:41.435 --> 00:52:44.432
Yeah, time flies
when you're having fun, doesn't it?

792
00:52:45.431 --> 00:52:48.428
You know, when I told you that
you could use the workshop at night...

793
00:52:48.429 --> 00:52:50.426
I didn't mean all night.
My wife's gonna kill me.

794
00:52:51.025 --> 00:52:53.723
You take yourself off home
and I'll have a snooze...

795
00:52:53.724 --> 00:52:56.320
in the back of the car
and you know, mate...

796
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.916
I'll lock up the place
before I go to sleep.

797
00:52:58.917 --> 00:53:02.414
Seems to me like a whole lot of effort
to sell a lousy 250 dollar motorcar.

798
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:05.910
Okay, Mr. Burt, you pull the door down.
Have a good night.

799
00:53:07.009 --> 00:53:11.805
Fernando.
Where do I take a leak around here?

800
00:53:12.604 --> 00:53:14.102
- Leak?
- Yeah, a pee...

801
00:53:14.402 --> 00:53:16.400
trouble with the old prostrate,
you know.

802
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.996
Yeah, go straight through those doors,
there's a door there that says Caballero...

803
00:53:20.496 --> 00:53:21.395
Alright.

804
00:53:22.394 --> 00:53:24.392
Well, I'll see you in the morning,
early okay?

805
00:53:24.492 --> 00:53:25.691
Good night.

806
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.289
Where were we?

807
00:53:31.485 --> 00:53:32.084
Burt?

808
00:53:34.382 --> 00:53:35.980
Buenos diaz, Mr. Burt.

809
00:53:39.477 --> 00:53:41.775
- So did you get it all finished?
- Yeah.

810
00:53:41.974 --> 00:53:46.070
All I need to do is find a couple
of wheels and I'll be ready to roll.

811
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:49.267
Well, you know, I have some wheels
in the back you can have...

812
00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:51.565
- if you just do me a favour.
- Say the word.

813
00:53:54.961 --> 00:53:56.460
Crank her now, Fernando.

814
00:53:57.559 --> 00:53:58.558
Good.

815
00:54:00.156 --> 00:54:01.255
- Burt?
- Yeah?

816
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:02.754
You're a god damned genius.

817
00:54:02.953 --> 00:54:03.852
Thank you.

818
00:54:04.052 --> 00:54:06.150
Hey listen, why you gotta go?

819
00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:08.148
Why don't you stick around here a while?
I'll pay you well.

820
00:54:08.348 --> 00:54:10.646
Sorry, mate, I've got to get
to Bonneville by the 23rd...

821
00:54:10.845 --> 00:54:14.642
that's when speed week starts and
you know, gotta hit the road.

822
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:17.938
- Well, you've always got a job here.
- Thanks mate, I'll see ya.

823
00:54:18.238 --> 00:54:19.936
- Best of luck to you.
- Ta ra.

824
00:54:21.135 --> 00:54:23.033
This guy is really good.

825
00:54:34.722 --> 00:54:36.120
Hello, love.

826
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.118
I was worried about you.

827
00:54:38.418 --> 00:54:41.415
Housekeeping said you didn't
sleep in your bed all night.

828
00:54:41.715 --> 00:54:43.213
Do I get a discount for that?

829
00:54:43.812 --> 00:54:44.810
I doubt it.

830
00:54:44.811 --> 00:54:47.309
I need you to show me on a map
how to get to Long Beach...

831
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:50.306
- so I can pick up my bike today.
- I'm finished here in 15 minutes.

832
00:54:50.406 --> 00:54:51.405
I'll come with you.

833
00:54:55.101 --> 00:54:57.998
Not a bad set of wheels
for 250 bucks eh?

834
00:54:58.098 --> 00:55:00.296
- You sure it'll make it to Utah?
- Yeah.

835
00:55:00.895 --> 00:55:03.693
This old girl will get you
to New Zealand and back.

836
00:55:04.192 --> 00:55:05.291
Here...

837
00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:07.389
- hop in my fair, lady.
- Thank you.

838
00:55:10.086 --> 00:55:12.484
The bloke who sold me this car,
he gave me a good tip...

839
00:55:12.584 --> 00:55:15.980
he said always remember
that the driver, that's me...

840
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.578
should be on the centre
of the road.

841
00:55:18.678 --> 00:55:20.176
- Look out, look out!
- Alright.

842
00:55:20.476 --> 00:55:24.272
In New Zealand we always drive
on the other side of the street.

843
00:55:25.371 --> 00:55:27.469
- You do?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

844
00:55:29.067 --> 00:55:30.265
Do you want me to drive?

845
00:55:30.266 --> 00:55:32.564
No, it's alright,
I have to get used to it, haven't I?

846
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.559
This should be customs
right here.

847
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.558
Right.

848
00:55:44.951 --> 00:55:46.849
- Hello.
- May I help you, sir?

849
00:55:47.049 --> 00:55:50.845
Yeah, my name's Burt Munro and
I've come to pick up my motorcycle...

850
00:55:51.145 --> 00:55:53.643
I came into port two days ago
from New Zealand...

851
00:55:53.942 --> 00:55:56.939
and on a freighter
called Rangatira...

852
00:55:57.139 --> 00:55:59.637
and I was told to come here
to clear it through customs.

853
00:56:00.935 --> 00:56:02.933
- Mr. Munro.
- Yeah, Munro...

854
00:56:03.233 --> 00:56:04.731
M U N R O.

855
00:56:07.529 --> 00:56:09.726
- Wait here a moment, sir.
- Thank you.

856
00:56:13.223 --> 00:56:15.920
Mr. Munro is here
for that damaged shipment.

857
00:56:19.117 --> 00:56:21.115
- Mr. Moonro.
- Munro.

858
00:56:21.315 --> 00:56:23.812
- Come with me please, to the storage area.
- Is there a problem?

859
00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.810
Your consignment
has suffered some damage.

860
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:27.808
Oh, no.

861
00:56:28.408 --> 00:56:31.704
Why the heck did I bother to paint
these arrows on the side of it then?

862
00:56:32.604 --> 00:56:35.101
That's the way it was
delivered here unfortunately.

863
00:56:35.102 --> 00:56:36.500
Well, what happened to it?

864
00:56:36.699 --> 00:56:38.598
My information is that
ten tons of fertilizer...

865
00:56:38.598 --> 00:56:40.496
was inadvertently
loaded on top of your box...

866
00:56:40.596 --> 00:56:43.093
while it was in the hold. If I was
you I'd sue the shipping company.

867
00:56:43.193 --> 00:56:46.590
Sue? I haven't got time to waste
my bloomin' life suing anybody.

868
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:48.786
Get some of your blokes to pull...

869
00:56:48.787 --> 00:56:51.185
this right side up so
we can get into the motorcycle...

870
00:56:51.186 --> 00:56:53.583
and see what damage
has been done.

871
00:56:54.981 --> 00:56:56.979
Alright, fellows,
let's get it unwrapped.

872
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.174
The tail looks alright.

873
00:57:07.269 --> 00:57:09.167
No damage so far.

874
00:57:10.965 --> 00:57:12.564
Oh no damage at all.

875
00:57:12.863 --> 00:57:13.862
Good.

876
00:57:14.062 --> 00:57:17.059
- Lucky it was packed so well.
- Yes, it's a blimmin' miracle.

877
00:57:19.157 --> 00:57:22.853
Well, the old Indian lives
to fight another day.

878
00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.445
Well, thanks a million, Tina.

879
00:57:31.545 --> 00:57:34.042
I don't know what I would have done
without you today...

880
00:57:34.043 --> 00:57:35.740
you're the real salt of the earth,
you know?

881
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.937
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to come home for dinner tonight?

882
00:57:38.938 --> 00:57:40.635
- I can't, love.
- I could cook you a meal.

883
00:57:40.735 --> 00:57:43.433
I've got to get this show on the road,
get out of Dodge as they say.

884
00:57:43.932 --> 00:57:46.130
Okay, my good friend
from Kiwi land.

885
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.328
- You stay in touch, won't you?
- I will.

886
00:57:48.827 --> 00:57:50.226
Here's my phone number.

887
00:57:50.625 --> 00:57:53.223
- Call me and tell me how you're doing.
- I will. Can I call collect?

888
00:57:53.922 --> 00:57:55.121
You can try.

889
00:58:01.614 --> 00:58:04.512
- It's a good job I think you're a woman.
- I am a woman.

890
00:58:04.711 --> 00:58:07.109
Yeah, right. Ta ra love, see ya.

891
00:58:34.981 --> 00:58:36.380
- Morning.
- Morning.

892
00:58:38.777 --> 00:58:40.376
Fill her up, would you please?

893
00:58:40.476 --> 00:58:41.874
Regular or Ethol?

894
00:58:42.973 --> 00:58:44.372
Who's Ethol?

895
00:58:45.171 --> 00:58:46.669
Alright...

896
00:58:47.269 --> 00:58:48.567
I'll take Ethol.

897
00:58:54.661 --> 00:58:56.559
- Hello, young fella.
- Hello.

898
00:58:56.759 --> 00:58:59.257
- Is this a rocket ship?
- What?

899
00:58:59.457 --> 00:59:01.055
Is this a rocket ship?

900
00:59:01.654 --> 00:59:02.853
I hope so.

901
00:59:42.414 --> 00:59:43.512
Oh Gosh.

902
00:59:50.306 --> 00:59:52.004
What's happened to you?

903
00:59:56.899 --> 00:59:57.898
Oh well.

904
01:00:01.594 --> 01:00:03.093
Let's have a look at ya.

905
01:00:19.476 --> 01:00:20.675
Got ya!

906
01:00:23.373 --> 01:00:24.571
Come on!

907
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.058
I thought we were going
to make it you and me...

908
01:00:39.057 --> 01:00:40.755
and now look what's happened.

909
01:01:33.802 --> 01:01:35.700
- Hello, mate.
- Got a problem?

910
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.798
Yeah. Am I glad to see you.

911
01:01:38.098 --> 01:01:41.894
Yeah, I've lost a wheel, help me get
my rig back on the road, will you?

912
01:01:42.094 --> 01:01:43.592
Okay, I'll see.

913
01:01:44.192 --> 01:01:46.290
My name's Burt, Burt Munro.

914
01:01:47.388 --> 01:01:48.387
Jake.

915
01:01:48.687 --> 01:01:50.385
- You Indian?
- Yes.

916
01:01:51.285 --> 01:01:54.381
Well, this here could be
the world's fastest Indian.

917
01:01:54.481 --> 01:01:56.080
Well, at least until just now.

918
01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.978
She's a bit heavy mind you.

919
01:01:58.178 --> 01:02:00.775
So let's take it easy,
one, two, three.

920
01:02:02.473 --> 01:02:04.172
Right.
You live around here, Jake?

921
01:02:21.454 --> 01:02:24.052
What do you want to ride
that contraption for?

922
01:02:24.551 --> 01:02:26.050
That's a good question.

923
01:02:28.148 --> 01:02:31.944
Well, I guess the reward
is in the doing of it.

924
01:02:33.842 --> 01:02:36.939
Jake, I'm dying for a pee.
Where do I go?

925
01:02:37.139 --> 01:02:39.037
There's a little building
right there.

926
01:02:39.137 --> 01:02:41.634
I've got a touch of prostrate
trouble, you know.

927
01:02:41.934 --> 01:02:43.532
I have similar problems.

928
01:02:44.232 --> 01:02:46.229
I thought you blokes would have...

929
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.228
some magic cures
for that sort of thing.

930
01:02:48.427 --> 01:02:49.726
Well, we have.

931
01:02:50.325 --> 01:02:53.622
One old remedy is ground up
dog balls...

932
01:02:53.822 --> 01:02:57.119
- but I prefer prostrate trouble.
- Yeah, I bet you do, mate.

933
01:03:00.615 --> 01:03:01.814
I got you!

934
01:03:03.712 --> 01:03:06.709
Jake, gotta get going,
gotta hit the road.

935
01:03:07.009 --> 01:03:09.606
- Burt, I have something for you.
- Whats that then?

936
01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:12.603
Whats this?

937
01:03:13.003 --> 01:03:15.500
- For good luck.
- Oh yeah? A piece of j...

938
01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:18.897
I've never worn jewellery before.
Thanks, mate.

939
01:03:18.997 --> 01:03:21.394
I've got something for you too.
Hang about.

940
01:03:23.093 --> 01:03:24.192
Right...

941
01:03:24.691 --> 01:03:25.890
let's see.

942
01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:32.383
I've got this, it's a spare one,
I made it myself.

943
01:03:33.183 --> 01:03:35.780
- What do I do with this?
- You got a hacksaw?

944
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.477
Just slice the top of it,
through where the gudgeon pin goes...

945
01:03:38.478 --> 01:03:39.876
and it'll make a great ash tray.

946
01:03:39.976 --> 01:03:41.874
Not that I approve of smoking,
mind you.

947
01:03:41.974 --> 01:03:43.971
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot, mate. So long.

948
01:03:43.972 --> 01:03:47.268
- Sorry we couldn't fix your trailer.
- That's alright, I'll get there somehow.

949
01:03:47.868 --> 01:03:48.967
Burt?

950
01:03:49.266 --> 01:03:50.565
What?

951
01:03:50.865 --> 01:03:52.164
For the prostrate.

952
01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:54.361
Use with water,
plenty of water.

953
01:03:55.061 --> 01:03:56.859
It tastes bad. Really bad.

954
01:03:57.059 --> 01:03:58.557
Dogs balls huh?

955
01:03:59.057 --> 01:04:01.254
Well, thanks a lot mate.
See ya.

956
01:05:02.993 --> 01:05:03.892
Hello.

957
01:05:07.688 --> 01:05:09.087
Anyone home?

958
01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:18.277
Hello.

959
01:05:18.377 --> 01:05:19.676
Hello, there.

960
01:05:22.473 --> 01:05:25.770
I've got a spot of bother
with my trailer, lost a wheel.

961
01:05:27.668 --> 01:05:30.565
- You're not from around these parts.
- No, I'm from down there.

962
01:05:31.364 --> 01:05:33.762
- What?
- I'm from down under...

963
01:05:34.161 --> 01:05:36.259
The other side of the world,
New Zealand.

964
01:05:36.359 --> 01:05:38.157
Southern most city
in the British Empire.

965
01:05:38.557 --> 01:05:39.956
Called Invercargill.

966
01:05:40.155 --> 01:05:42.453
One of the most beautiful
cities on Earth.

967
01:05:43.152 --> 01:05:44.651
Name's Burt Munro.

968
01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:46.249
Burt? Ada.

969
01:05:46.449 --> 01:05:47.748
- What?
- Ada.

970
01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:50.445
There she is.

971
01:05:57.138 --> 01:05:59.236
We got some problems here,
yes sirree.

972
01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:02.233
I tell you what you need to do.

973
01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:05.830
Cannibalize the stuffed axel
out of that old Ford right there.

974
01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.027
Lucky for you
I've got some welding gear.

975
01:06:08.028 --> 01:06:10.225
- We'll get a new wheel on there pronto.
- Good.

976
01:06:19.816 --> 01:06:21.114
That's got it.

977
01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:24.211
When you are...

978
01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.309
finished there...

979
01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:29.406
I've got something that
I want to show you.

980
01:06:29.806 --> 01:06:31.304
Yeah, what's that?

981
01:06:33.402 --> 01:06:34.801
Never you mind.

982
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.799
You just get that wheel on
there right.

983
01:06:49.986 --> 01:06:51.684
Why'd you bring me out here?

984
01:06:51.884 --> 01:06:54.281
I want to show you this.

985
01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.079
What?

986
01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.278
Right here.

987
01:07:03.872 --> 01:07:08.167
I laid my old boy to rest
twelve years ago next week.

988
01:07:08.367 --> 01:07:09.966
I sure miss him.

989
01:07:10.165 --> 01:07:12.263
I sure do miss the old boy.

990
01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:14.861
He did his level best.

991
01:07:16.159 --> 01:07:17.458
He did.

992
01:07:17.858 --> 01:07:20.055
I always figured a man's
like a blade of grass...

993
01:07:20.255 --> 01:07:22.853
he grows up in the spring,
strong and healthy and green...

994
01:07:23.052 --> 01:07:27.648
and then he reaches middle age
and he ripens as it were and...

995
01:07:28.747 --> 01:07:31.744
in the autumn he,
like a blade of grass...

996
01:07:32.043 --> 01:07:35.340
he finishes just fades away
and he never comes back.

997
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.938
Just like a blade of grass.

998
01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:40.935
I think when you're dead,
you're dead.

999
01:07:41.434 --> 01:07:44.231
I've always thought that,
since I grew up.

1000
01:07:44.531 --> 01:07:46.729
Is that your philosophy?

1001
01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:48.427
Well, I don't know,
yeah, I suppose it is...

1002
01:07:48.527 --> 01:07:53.322
when you get to my age these
thoughts cross your mind sometimes.

1003
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.119
Jump!

1004
01:07:56.819 --> 01:07:58.217
Jump!

1005
01:07:58.817 --> 01:08:01.114
Sideways, you fool,
sideways!

1006
01:08:01.914 --> 01:08:04.611
My God, man, haven't you ever
seen a snake before?

1007
01:08:04.911 --> 01:08:06.509
No, we don't have snakes
in New Zealand.

1008
01:08:06.609 --> 01:08:08.707
Good God,
I ought to move there.

1009
01:08:09.606 --> 01:08:11.304
- Where's he going?
- Damn rattlers!

1010
01:08:11.904 --> 01:08:14.801
- Any more around here? Oh, God.
- Fancy this?

1011
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.596
You come all this way
to bite the dust up at Boot Hill?

1012
01:08:21.394 --> 01:08:23.792
That would be a laugh,
wouldn't it?

1013
01:08:24.091 --> 01:08:25.490
Be a laugh.

1014
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:26.889
There you go, there you go.

1015
01:08:28.387 --> 01:08:29.486
Oh, my God!

1016
01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:37.977
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

1017
01:08:39.776 --> 01:08:41.674
I don't know, I've no idea.

1018
01:08:44.471 --> 01:08:45.370
I don't know.

1019
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:07.648
I had a strange dream
last night.

1020
01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.744
I dreamt about my late...

1021
01:09:13.042 --> 01:09:15.540
twin brother, Ernie.

1022
01:09:17.438 --> 01:09:20.835
I thought he was in the room here
looking down on us.

1023
01:09:22.932 --> 01:09:26.629
I guess it's all
that fun and games...

1024
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.627
at the graveyard.

1025
01:09:31.724 --> 01:09:32.922
I suppose.

1026
01:09:33.222 --> 01:09:34.221
Oh, well.

1027
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.016
Getting old ain't for the faint
of heart I'll tell you that.

1028
01:09:39.116 --> 01:09:41.614
Oh, God. What have you done
to my back, Ada?

1029
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:46.809
I am getting old.

1030
01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:52.203
Come on old girl, make me a cup of tea,
I've got to hit the road.

1031
01:09:52.902 --> 01:09:56.199
Ada, come on, you haven't died
in our sleep, have you, old girl?

1032
01:09:56.499 --> 01:09:59.496
- Make me a cup of tea.
- Come here, lover boy.

1033
01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.694
I'll make it myself.

1034
01:10:02.193 --> 01:10:03.492
Thanks.

1035
01:10:07.488 --> 01:10:10.585
Now Burt, you promise me you're going
to pop in on your way back...

1036
01:10:10.785 --> 01:10:13.681
because I can always use
another little cuddle.

1037
01:10:13.682 --> 01:10:16.179
Yeah, that's what I said, Ada,
that's what I intend to do.

1038
01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:19.476
There's many good tune played on
an old Banjo as they say.

1039
01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:23.472
- And what we don't use, we lose.
- Well, that's what they say.

1040
01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:25.770
See ya. Ta ra, darling.

1041
01:10:26.269 --> 01:10:30.065
And you have good luck
with your Indian.

1042
01:10:30.265 --> 01:10:32.063
You should say
break a leg.

1043
01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:34.860
See ya.

1044
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.039
Gidday.

1045
01:10:56.539 --> 01:10:58.037
Boy is it hot out there.

1046
01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:01.634
I bet the birds fly backwards
around here...

1047
01:11:01.734 --> 01:11:04.131
to keep the dust out
of their eyes.

1048
01:11:04.331 --> 01:11:07.927
- What can I get you?
- I'd like a cup of tea, please.

1049
01:11:08.227 --> 01:11:10.024
- Cup of tea?
- Yeah, best drink...

1050
01:11:10.025 --> 01:11:12.922
for quenching the thirst
when the weather's hot.

1051
01:11:13.322 --> 01:11:15.819
We haven't seen a cup of tea
in here ever.

1052
01:11:16.119 --> 01:11:20.015
We got Coors, we got Schlitz
or Miller or Coke and whiskey.

1053
01:11:22.213 --> 01:11:24.311
Well, I'll have coke then.

1054
01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:31.404
You know smoking's bad for you,
don't you?

1055
01:11:32.103 --> 01:11:34.001
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

1056
01:11:34.201 --> 01:11:36.599
Personally I don't smoke
and I don't drink.

1057
01:11:36.798 --> 01:11:38.996
I had the right education
from my dad on that one.

1058
01:11:39.196 --> 01:11:43.092
He was like King James the first,
great anti-smoking man.

1059
01:11:43.891 --> 01:11:46.389
Sounds like you're on a one
man crusade there grandpa.

1060
01:11:46.689 --> 01:11:49.985
Yeah, well, you're born with one
pair of lungs so why destroy...

1061
01:11:49.986 --> 01:11:51.584
them with that muck?

1062
01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:54.181
Where are you from?
Where's your home town?

1063
01:11:54.681 --> 01:11:56.679
- You English?
- Heavens no...

1064
01:11:56.878 --> 01:11:59.775
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from Invercargill in New Zealand.

1065
01:12:00.075 --> 01:12:02.173
- Where?
- Invercargill.

1066
01:12:02.473 --> 01:12:06.169
I-N-V-E-R-C-A-R-G-I-L-L.

1067
01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:10.265
I spell it with one L
sometimes to save ink.

1068
01:12:13.362 --> 01:12:17.558
- Got any of those critters over there?
- Oh yes, much bigger though...

1069
01:12:17.757 --> 01:12:20.155
we breed them down there
on big farms...

1070
01:12:20.655 --> 01:12:23.652
and we cut off their antlers and
send them over to Hong Kong and they...

1071
01:12:23.751 --> 01:12:27.348
grind the antlers into dust
and they eat that stuff...

1072
01:12:28.347 --> 01:12:31.344
must be some sort of aphrodisiac
or something.

1073
01:12:32.143 --> 01:12:33.941
Puts lead in your pencil.

1074
01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:37.238
You could do with some
of that, Leroy.

1075
01:12:40.235 --> 01:12:41.833
Your girlfriend?

1076
01:12:42.433 --> 01:12:43.432
Wife.

1077
01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:46.529
Oh, dear!

1078
01:12:52.423 --> 01:12:53.721
You alright?

1079
01:13:27.787 --> 01:13:30.784
Did you decide to leave Jackie
a tip after all?

1080
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.177
Look sir, if you're not feeling well
you should drop in to the hospital...

1081
01:13:38.178 --> 01:13:39.376
in the next town.

1082
01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:41.574
Alright.

1083
01:14:19.735 --> 01:14:21.234
Roll down your window.

1084
01:14:21.434 --> 01:14:22.632
What?

1085
01:14:27.228 --> 01:14:28.427
What's the problem?

1086
01:14:28.626 --> 01:14:30.525
You're parked illegally.

1087
01:14:31.024 --> 01:14:34.021
- You're a danger to the passing traffic.
- Am I?

1088
01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.218
- Let's see your driver's license.
- Yeah, alright.

1089
01:14:39.815 --> 01:14:40.914
Here you are.

1090
01:14:48.007 --> 01:14:50.105
- Where are you from?
- From New Zealand.

1091
01:14:50.405 --> 01:14:54.301
That's the land of the
long white cloud. Aotearoa.

1092
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.299
Home of the kiwi bird.

1093
01:14:56.598 --> 01:14:59.695
Well, I don't care if you're from Mars,
you cannot stop here.

1094
01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:01.093
Alright.

1095
01:15:01.094 --> 01:15:04.790
You cannot stop on the side of this road,
you're parked illegally.

1096
01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:09.386
Okay, well, sorry, I was having
a bit of a heart attack and...

1097
01:15:09.885 --> 01:15:11.783
well recovering
from one anyway.

1098
01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:14.481
Yeah, well, next time,
how about we stop at a proper rest area.

1099
01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.079
Yeah, alright, okay.

1100
01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:19.476
Name's Burt Munro.
Sorry about that.

1101
01:15:26.868 --> 01:15:28.367
Oil's OK.

1102
01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.165
- Thank you.
- That's alright, sir.

1103
01:15:30.664 --> 01:15:31.763
Excuse me.

1104
01:15:32.063 --> 01:15:33.362
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

1105
01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:36.858
Listen, I was wondering
if I could catch a ride?

1106
01:15:37.058 --> 01:15:40.954
My car, she just broke down and I'm
really trying to get to Salt Lake City.

1107
01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:44.151
I'm only going as far as Wendover,
that's where I'm stopping.

1108
01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:46.448
Well, anything would be
better than nothing.

1109
01:15:46.449 --> 01:15:49.545
- Ain't that the truth? Hop in, mate.
- Hey, thank you.

1110
01:15:51.444 --> 01:15:54.041
I'm going to go see
my girlfriend...

1111
01:15:54.241 --> 01:15:56.439
she just moved from LA
to Salt Lake, so.

1112
01:15:57.438 --> 01:15:59.635
I'm home on leave from 'Nam.

1113
01:15:59.935 --> 01:16:01.334
- What?
- Vietnam?

1114
01:16:01.533 --> 01:16:02.732
Oh, yeah.

1115
01:16:03.232 --> 01:16:05.829
Hey, what is that you've
got strapped on back there?

1116
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:09.525
That, young fellow,
is an Indian.

1117
01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:12.023
Motorcycle.

1118
01:16:13.222 --> 01:16:15.020
So what are you doing
in Vietnam?

1119
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.018
I'm involved
in operation ranch hand.

1120
01:16:17.318 --> 01:16:19.815
Oh, what's that?
Farming or something?

1121
01:16:20.215 --> 01:16:23.012
No, not exactly,
we just started this program...

1122
01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:27.108
we are spraying the jungle
from the air with herbicides...

1123
01:16:27.308 --> 01:16:30.504
so the enemy, the Vietcong,
don't have any place to hide.

1124
01:16:30.904 --> 01:16:35.100
Agent Orange we call this stuff,
it comes in these big old orange drums.

1125
01:16:37.098 --> 01:16:38.996
How is it working out?

1126
01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:44.191
Well, I'm home on two months leave
and I've got to get my arse back there.

1127
01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:48.486
We should have this war done in 6 months
or so, that's what they keep telling us.

1128
01:16:48.686 --> 01:16:51.084
Can't wait to get my arse out of there
to tell you the truth.

1129
01:16:51.384 --> 01:16:54.880
Yeah, I remember
the Great War in 1914...

1130
01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.475
I was about your age and
that's what they kept telling everyone.

1131
01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:02.273
Soon be over.

1132
01:17:02.572 --> 01:17:05.669
20 million dead and four years later
it was still going on.

1133
01:17:06.768 --> 01:17:09.266
Not as bad
as the big flu epidemic though.

1134
01:17:09.965 --> 01:17:12.962
Killed 21 million, that did.
Maybe more.

1135
01:17:13.861 --> 01:17:15.759
Every day,
when I left to go to work...

1136
01:17:15.859 --> 01:17:19.156
my mum would spray some formalin
on my shirt...

1137
01:17:20.255 --> 01:17:22.852
and maybe that's why
I didn't catch it.

1138
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:26.149
Or maybe I was just lucky.
You never know.

1139
01:17:28.347 --> 01:17:30.345
- Knock on wood.
- Yep.

1140
01:17:32.442 --> 01:17:34.240
You know,
life's a funny thing...

1141
01:17:34.241 --> 01:17:36.538
you never know
what's around the corner, do you?

1142
01:17:38.936 --> 01:17:40.434
Your shaving brush.

1143
01:17:41.433 --> 01:17:42.632
Has had it's day.

1144
01:17:43.032 --> 01:17:44.930
It won't achieve.

1145
01:17:45.729 --> 01:17:47.328
The Modern way.

1146
01:17:49.226 --> 01:17:51.024
Burma Shave.

1147
01:17:52.822 --> 01:17:56.019
She doesn't kiss ya
like she used to?

1148
01:17:56.418 --> 01:17:59.515
Has she seen
some smoother rooster?

1149
01:18:00.514 --> 01:18:02.013
Burma Shave.

1150
01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:05.709
These signs we dedicate...

1151
01:18:06.309 --> 01:18:07.507
to men...

1152
01:18:07.707 --> 01:18:10.504
who've had no date of late.

1153
01:18:11.104 --> 01:18:12.602
Burma Shave.

1154
01:18:13.202 --> 01:18:16.099
Yeah, that's us.
Well, you anyway.

1155
01:18:22.592 --> 01:18:24.191
Look at that.

1156
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:26.788
That's a cowboy and a half.

1157
01:18:29.385 --> 01:18:31.383
I was thinking I'd come out
to the Salt with you.

1158
01:18:31.483 --> 01:18:33.481
I'd like to be there
the first time you see it...

1159
01:18:33.482 --> 01:18:35.280
it's only a couple of miles
up the road so.

1160
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.178
Yeah, alright then,
that sounds good.

1161
01:18:37.477 --> 01:18:39.975
Looks like there's a lot of people
in town for speed week, huh?

1162
01:18:40.275 --> 01:18:41.673
Yeah, looks like it.

1163
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:47.767
This is it, Burt.
We're gonna take a left right up here.

1164
01:19:00.055 --> 01:19:01.553
Bonneville...

1165
01:19:02.053 --> 01:19:03.551
I mean I can't believe it.

1166
01:19:03.851 --> 01:19:06.149
I mean I'm here, I've made it.

1167
01:19:07.547 --> 01:19:08.846
I've made it.

1168
01:19:36.818 --> 01:19:39.715
You know, all my life
I wanted to do something big.

1169
01:19:40.814 --> 01:19:43.311
Something better and bigger
than all the other jokers.

1170
01:19:45.210 --> 01:19:46.708
This is it, Bonneville.

1171
01:19:47.907 --> 01:19:51.603
This is the place
where big things happen.

1172
01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:58.896
Do you realize, Rusty, the fastest
man has ever gone on land is here?

1173
01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.793
Right here, where we are now.

1174
01:20:05.389 --> 01:20:08.786
Malcolm Campbell did it here,
with a Bluebird.

1175
01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:11.783
First guy to go
over 300 mile an hour...

1176
01:20:11.883 --> 01:20:14.880
and then later his son, Donald Campbell
was here with Proteus.

1177
01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:18.776
He crashed at 350 mile an hour
and lived to tell the tale.

1178
01:20:20.674 --> 01:20:22.173
John Cobb was here.

1179
01:20:23.271 --> 01:20:26.268
First guy
to go over 400 mile an hour.

1180
01:20:27.267 --> 01:20:29.265
All the great attempts.

1181
01:20:29.765 --> 01:20:32.562
George Easton with Thunderbolt and...

1182
01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:36.059
Mickey Thompson
with Challenger.

1183
01:20:39.355 --> 01:20:42.053
I'm telling you, Rusty,
this place is holy ground, mate.

1184
01:20:43.451 --> 01:20:44.650
Holy ground.

1185
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:48.246
And I made it here.

1186
01:21:17.517 --> 01:21:18.716
Well, Burt.

1187
01:21:19.315 --> 01:21:20.414
Thanks a million.

1188
01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:22.013
I'll be looking for you
in the record books.

1189
01:21:22.113 --> 01:21:24.510
You take care out there in Vietnam,
won't you?

1190
01:21:24.511 --> 01:21:25.509
I'll be trying.

1191
01:21:26.009 --> 01:21:27.307
- Okay, mate.
- Drive safe.

1192
01:21:27.607 --> 01:21:29.106
- See ya
- See ya.

1193
01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:48.027
God.

1194
01:23:16.098 --> 01:23:17.497
Jesus.

1195
01:23:50.264 --> 01:23:51.863
- Gidday.
- Hey, there.

1196
01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.758
- It's going to be a great day.
- Yeah.

1197
01:23:57.257 --> 01:23:59.755
Still... no wind.

1198
01:24:00.454 --> 01:24:02.052
Lovely day for a run.

1199
01:24:03.851 --> 01:24:05.599
Salt's in good shape.

1200
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.347
Yeah. Firm and dry.

1201
01:24:07.647 --> 01:24:09.845
Dead flat. No soft patches.

1202
01:24:10.444 --> 01:24:12.142
Not like the beach.

1203
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:15.139
I can do it here.

1204
01:24:15.739 --> 01:24:16.838
Yep.

1205
01:24:17.437 --> 01:24:19.735
This week.
It's what we're here for.

1206
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:25.529
Wow, is that yours?

1207
01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:27.527
Yep.

1208
01:24:28.426 --> 01:24:30.224
Gosh, she's a beauty.

1209
01:24:31.223 --> 01:24:33.221
I bet she goes fast.

1210
01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.518
- That yours?
- Yeah, that's an old Indian.

1211
01:24:37.217 --> 01:24:39.015
My name's Munro, Burt Munro.

1212
01:24:39.215 --> 01:24:42.112
- From down under, New Zealand.
- A long way from home.

1213
01:24:42.312 --> 01:24:44.810
Jim Moffatt, San Jose,
California.

1214
01:24:45.009 --> 01:24:46.808
- Nice to meet you, Burt.
- Good to meet you, Jim.

1215
01:24:47.007 --> 01:24:48.806
<i>Let's get to the start line.</i>

1216
01:24:49.105 --> 01:24:53.701
<i>The race is about to start
and all the racers are excited.</i>

1217
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:58.096
This car is driven by Jim Moffatt,
San Jose, California.

1218
01:24:58.396 --> 01:25:01.793
The other pilots are...

1219
01:25:12.282 --> 01:25:14.780
- Come on, guys, 15 minutes.
- Come on.

1220
01:25:15.279 --> 01:25:16.977
Come on, let's go.

1221
01:25:25.469 --> 01:25:27.467
- Morning.
- Hello, Burt Munro.

1222
01:25:27.767 --> 01:25:29.165
- Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

1223
01:25:30.164 --> 01:25:32.562
- Are you checked in?
- No, not yet.

1224
01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:37.357
Well, you've got to remove the shell
before we do the tech inspection.

1225
01:25:37.557 --> 01:25:39.855
- Where do I check in?
- It's just over there.

1226
01:25:40.054 --> 01:25:41.952
- Thanks, fellas.
- Okay.

1227
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:45.549
I gotta see this.

1228
01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:49.445
Hello, I've come to check in.
Munro, Burt Munro.

1229
01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.343
Registration number?

1230
01:25:52.142 --> 01:25:53.341
What?

1231
01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:56.438
Registration number.
I don't see your number here.

1232
01:25:56.638 --> 01:25:59.535
No, it's number 35.

1233
01:25:59.735 --> 01:26:03.631
It's on the side of my motorcycle
over there, that's my lucky number.

1234
01:26:03.930 --> 01:26:05.229
Have you registered?

1235
01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:09.324
No, that's what
I've come over for.

1236
01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:11.623
These two blokes sent me over here,
Mike and someone else.

1237
01:26:11.922 --> 01:26:14.320
Sir, registration closed
last month.

1238
01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.916
If you haven't registered,
I'm sorry, you just can't run.

1239
01:26:20.814 --> 01:26:22.512
I can't run?

1240
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:27.107
Well, how was I supposed to know
I should have pre-registered?

1241
01:26:27.108 --> 01:26:29.305
I've come a heck of a long way
to ride my bike.

1242
01:26:29.306 --> 01:26:31.502
I'm not going anywhere
until I've done just that.

1243
01:26:31.503 --> 01:26:34.400
I've come all the way from New Zealand,
you know. It's a long way.

1244
01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.398
Look, mister,
we don't make the rules.

1245
01:26:36.698 --> 01:26:40.094
An event like this doesn't just happen
in one day, rules are rules.

1246
01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:42.091
Entries closed July 31st.

1247
01:26:42.092 --> 01:26:45.888
Well, crikey, I live in Invercargill,
it's half way round the bloody earth.

1248
01:26:46.388 --> 01:26:49.085
How was I supposed to know these things?
I didn't know all this stuff.

1249
01:26:49.086 --> 01:26:50.384
Sir, it's not our problem.

1250
01:26:50.484 --> 01:26:53.081
I thought I could just turn up here
and have my bike timed.

1251
01:26:53.082 --> 01:26:55.679
- You don't have to call me sir...
- Well, you thought wrong.

1252
01:27:05.369 --> 01:27:07.467
Jim Moffatt!

1253
01:27:07.966 --> 01:27:10.264
It's Burt, Burt Munro.
Can you come over here, mate?

1254
01:27:11.063 --> 01:27:12.362
I'll be right back.

1255
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.760
I need a bit of help.

1256
01:27:15.059 --> 01:27:16.558
Hey, Burt. What's up?

1257
01:27:16.957 --> 01:27:20.654
Well, I have these blokes telling
me I can't run my bike...

1258
01:27:20.853 --> 01:27:22.851
because I'm not pre-registered.

1259
01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:25.649
- You didn't register?
- No, I didn't know anything about it.

1260
01:27:25.749 --> 01:27:28.246
You know how it is Jim,
rules are rules.

1261
01:27:28.546 --> 01:27:31.643
- You should have registered months ago.
- I didn't know.

1262
01:27:33.141 --> 01:27:35.639
I'll have a talk with these guys later,
see if I can change their minds.

1263
01:27:35.838 --> 01:27:39.235
- Your blood's worth bottling.
- I don't know about that.

1264
01:27:39.435 --> 01:27:41.432
Look,
we can talk about this later.

1265
01:27:41.433 --> 01:27:43.231
Maybe you can let him go
through tech inspection.

1266
01:27:43.431 --> 01:27:46.827
Get that out of the way?
Just in case we can let him ride.

1267
01:27:47.727 --> 01:27:49.525
You're asking a lot.

1268
01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:51.822
Alright.

1269
01:27:55.818 --> 01:27:57.317
- Okay.
- Alright.

1270
01:27:57.617 --> 01:27:59.715
- Make me proud.
- Thanks a lot.

1271
01:28:00.014 --> 01:28:02.012
You give me a bit
of a fright there.

1272
01:28:06.807 --> 01:28:09.705
You know these don't look
like high speed tyres.

1273
01:28:10.004 --> 01:28:11.603
Well, they are high speed tyres.

1274
01:28:12.402 --> 01:28:15.699
Look at these hairline cracks,
these tyres have got to be 25 years old.

1275
01:28:16.098 --> 01:28:17.796
- What happened to the tread?
- What?

1276
01:28:17.996 --> 01:28:20.093
I said,
what happened to the tread?

1277
01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.493
Well, I cut it off,
that's what happened to the tread...

1278
01:28:21.593 --> 01:28:22.990
I cut it off with a carving knife...

1279
01:28:22.991 --> 01:28:25.389
otherwise it wouldn't be
a high speed tyre, would it?

1280
01:28:25.788 --> 01:28:27.186
What are you talking about?

1281
01:28:27.187 --> 01:28:30.384
Well, you've got to keep the weight in
otherwise when you get to a high speed...

1282
01:28:30.385 --> 01:28:32.682
the centrifugal force will
the tread right off, wouldn't it?

1283
01:28:33.081 --> 01:28:36.977
I run them on 65 pounds of air and
that tyre's safe up to 300 miles an hour.

1284
01:28:37.177 --> 01:28:39.575
I guarantee it. These are high
speed tyres and I made them.

1285
01:28:39.774 --> 01:28:41.673
Well, you're going to have
to replace them.

1286
01:28:41.972 --> 01:28:43.571
The suspension here is
a leaf spring...

1287
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:44.969
I mean can we pass that?

1288
01:28:45.269 --> 01:28:48.266
Geez, last leaf spring on a motorcycle
must have been in the 1920s.

1289
01:28:48.566 --> 01:28:49.864
Well, it is 42 years old.

1290
01:28:50.164 --> 01:28:54.060
- These brakes look completely inadequate.
- Well, I'm planning on going, not stopping.

1291
01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.057
Well, the brakes were old
fashioned 40 years ago.

1292
01:28:57.756 --> 01:28:59.555
Is this a hinge of a gate post?

1293
01:28:59.754 --> 01:29:01.852
No, that's from an old kitchen door.

1294
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:07.447
Let me just ask you what is this?

1295
01:29:07.647 --> 01:29:10.644
It's a cork, what does it look like?
It's a cork from a brandy bottle.

1296
01:29:10.843 --> 01:29:15.239
You know, the thing is it's all about
weight. The less weight, the faster you go.

1297
01:29:15.339 --> 01:29:16.438
And where's your chute?

1298
01:29:16.638 --> 01:29:18.536
- What?
- Where's your parachute?

1299
01:29:18.636 --> 01:29:20.534
I'm not planning on bailing out.

1300
01:29:20.634 --> 01:29:23.031
No wait,
you've got to have a safety chute.

1301
01:29:23.032 --> 01:29:24.529
Well, I can't afford one.

1302
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:27.227
These forks, if they give out we've
got ourselves some real problems.

1303
01:29:27.427 --> 01:29:29.724
I think I'd have a bit of
a problem that way, wouldn't I?

1304
01:29:30.424 --> 01:29:31.922
- Where's your fire suit?
- What?

1305
01:29:32.222 --> 01:29:33.620
Where's your fire suit?

1306
01:29:33.621 --> 01:29:36.018
Good heavens, man,
I don't intend to burst into flames.

1307
01:29:36.218 --> 01:29:38.366
Always wear me old suit pants
for good luck.

1308
01:29:38.367 --> 01:29:40.513
If they were good enough
to get married in...

1309
01:29:40.514 --> 01:29:42.811
they're good enough to ride
this old girl in and no...

1310
01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:45.209
I tuck the legs of my pants
into my socks like this...

1311
01:29:45.409 --> 01:29:48.506
stop them getting caught
in the chain and Bob's your uncle.

1312
01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:51.203
You've got your suit pants,
what are you gonna wear on top?

1313
01:29:51.204 --> 01:29:52.002
What?

1314
01:29:52.102 --> 01:29:55.099
You've got your suit pants,
what do you intend to wear on top?

1315
01:29:55.299 --> 01:29:59.694
Yes, a black woollen shirt, New Zealand
wool, water resistant, fire resistant...

1316
01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.393
and me bash hat.

1317
01:30:02.092 --> 01:30:03.591
Bash hat?

1318
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:05.288
Yeah, crash helmet.

1319
01:30:05.289 --> 01:30:08.586
You're crazy, you've got to wear
at least a leather jacket on top.

1320
01:30:08.586 --> 01:30:11.882
You put the bike down on the salt,
it's like coarse sand paper...

1321
01:30:11.883 --> 01:30:13.281
it's going to rub
your head right off.

1322
01:30:13.282 --> 01:30:15.078
I couldn't get into the shell...

1323
01:30:15.079 --> 01:30:18.176
with anything bulkier than the shirt on
my back. It's a very tight fit in there.

1324
01:30:18.376 --> 01:30:19.475
Straight out of the ark.

1325
01:30:20.574 --> 01:30:22.572
- What did you say?
- Straight out of the ark.

1326
01:30:22.771 --> 01:30:25.668
Don't be so cheeky.
What's your name, young man?

1327
01:30:26.268 --> 01:30:28.166
McFarlane. Mike McFarlane.

1328
01:30:28.366 --> 01:30:31.463
I knew a McFarlane, he used to sell
milking machines in Timaru.

1329
01:30:31.662 --> 01:30:34.060
You must be related to him
because he was a total prick.

1330
01:30:35.259 --> 01:30:37.357
Look here, you don't even have
a fire extinguisher installed.

1331
01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:42.152
Mike McFarlane used to give me milking
machine parts to make my sprockets with.

1332
01:30:42.252 --> 01:30:43.350
How old are you?

1333
01:30:43.351 --> 01:30:45.049
I don't know,
he was about 35 when I knew him.

1334
01:30:45.249 --> 01:30:46.447
No how old are you?

1335
01:30:46.448 --> 01:30:49.844
His brother owned a general store
down in a place called Bulls...

1336
01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:52.741
- that's a town in New Zealand.
- Sir, your machine is not safe.

1337
01:30:53.141 --> 01:30:55.938
I've been doing this for 43 years
and I'm still here to tell the tale.

1338
01:30:56.138 --> 01:30:59.335
Time's change, we started taking
airplanes instead of riding horseback.

1339
01:30:59.535 --> 01:31:01.433
- Horse power?
- Horse back. Horse back.

1340
01:31:01.434 --> 01:31:02.731
Horse back, yeah.
I got you, yeah.

1341
01:31:03.730 --> 01:31:05.029
You're too old.

1342
01:31:05.429 --> 01:31:08.326
Bollocks. I may have this saggy skin
on the outside...

1343
01:31:08.327 --> 01:31:09.824
but on the inside
I'm still 18 years old...

1344
01:31:10.024 --> 01:31:12.022
and I'll give you a run for your money,
young fella.

1345
01:31:13.521 --> 01:31:15.119
You need some help?

1346
01:31:15.419 --> 01:31:16.518
Hello.

1347
01:31:17.616 --> 01:31:20.514
Rollie Free, Marty Dickerson,
we're a couple of bike fans.

1348
01:31:20.813 --> 01:31:23.710
- Burt Munro from Kiwi land.
- Pleasure, Burt.

1349
01:31:26.108 --> 01:31:27.906
You got me good there.

1350
01:31:28.106 --> 01:31:29.604
Where are you staying?

1351
01:31:29.804 --> 01:31:31.801
That's my salubrious
accommodation...

1352
01:31:31.802 --> 01:31:34.000
I usually sleep at night
in the back seat.

1353
01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.898
Salubrious you say Munro, huh?

1354
01:31:37.097 --> 01:31:38.895
We've been hearing a lot about you.

1355
01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:41.193
Sounds like you're cutting
your finances mighty fine.

1356
01:31:41.493 --> 01:31:42.991
Yeah, you could say that again.

1357
01:31:43.191 --> 01:31:45.389
We'll we're up at the Western Ridge,
why don't you drop by...

1358
01:31:45.588 --> 01:31:47.586
it looks as though you could
use a good shower...

1359
01:31:47.686 --> 01:31:50.683
and everybody's staying there and
I bet that there's a spare bed there too.

1360
01:31:50.983 --> 01:31:53.381
Thanks a lot, you yanks
are classic you know that?

1361
01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:55.479
You don't catch me that easily.

1362
01:32:01.473 --> 01:32:02.771
Hey, Burt.

1363
01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:04.270
Hello.

1364
01:32:06.368 --> 01:32:08.266
The front forks could
go at any time...

1365
01:32:08.366 --> 01:32:10.663
the suspension is right out
of the 1920s.

1366
01:32:10.863 --> 01:32:13.161
Got hairline cracks all
over his tyres...

1367
01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:16.158
he's got no fire extinguisher,
no safety chute.

1368
01:32:16.358 --> 01:32:19.754
I told you, if it's a time problem, the
old guy's welcome to use some of my time.

1369
01:32:19.954 --> 01:32:22.252
It's not a time problem,
it's a bike problem.

1370
01:32:22.551 --> 01:32:23.950
Well, I think we ought
to let him run.

1371
01:32:24.549 --> 01:32:26.547
He came all the way from
New Zealand to do this.

1372
01:32:26.747 --> 01:32:29.245
Jim, have you had a good look
at his machine?

1373
01:32:29.345 --> 01:32:31.143
All I know is the man's
the genuine article.

1374
01:32:31.443 --> 01:32:33.441
Yeah, but the bike is
the genuine dinosaur.

1375
01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:36.636
Look, we carry the cans
for the decisions around here.

1376
01:32:36.637 --> 01:32:39.634
And if he kills himself and there's
about a 100 to 1 that he will...

1377
01:32:39.635 --> 01:32:42.332
...we are gonna have a hell
of a lot of trouble on our hands.

1378
01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:47.127
Yeah, sounds like we're a bunch
of chicken shits if you want my opinion.

1379
01:32:47.227 --> 01:32:50.923
His bike didn't even come close
to passing tech inspection, Jim.

1380
01:33:00.713 --> 01:33:01.413
Burt.

1381
01:33:02.312 --> 01:33:03.710
Hello, Jim. Come in.

1382
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:06.207
Rollie Free said
I could find you here.

1383
01:33:06.208 --> 01:33:09.205
Rollie Free, he's the best,
he's a real gentleman.

1384
01:33:09.405 --> 01:33:11.802
He set me up in this place
for nothing.

1385
01:33:15.299 --> 01:33:16.398
What are you doing?

1386
01:33:16.897 --> 01:33:20.294
Well, the soft shoe polish
fills in the cracks makes the tyres...

1387
01:33:20.493 --> 01:33:22.691
Look spick and span,
good as new.

1388
01:33:22.891 --> 01:33:24.390
Cheaper than new ones anyway.

1389
01:33:24.689 --> 01:33:25.888
I didn't see that.

1390
01:33:28.585 --> 01:33:30.583
Well? Can I run?

1391
01:33:33.381 --> 01:33:34.679
I'm sorry, Burt.

1392
01:33:41.872 --> 01:33:43.970
Who the heck
do they think they are?

1393
01:33:44.769 --> 01:33:48.266
Crikey Jim, you know, I'm not trying
to run a mile in four minutes...

1394
01:33:48.366 --> 01:33:51.163
all I've got to do is sit there
and open up the throttle...

1395
01:33:51.263 --> 01:33:54.659
I mean, after all
it's my ruddy life, isn't it?

1396
01:33:55.658 --> 01:33:57.256
Can't you do anything?

1397
01:33:57.257 --> 01:34:01.852
I mean, I just want to try and get her
to go over 200 just once that's all...

1398
01:34:01.952 --> 01:34:03.849
once I've cracked 200
I'll be quite happy...

1399
01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:06.447
to piss off back home to New Zealand
and Bob's your uncle.

1400
01:34:07.047 --> 01:34:11.043
You're a well respected man around here,
can you talk to them?

1401
01:34:11.343 --> 01:34:12.541
I tried.

1402
01:34:13.341 --> 01:34:16.338
You've got as much chance
of writing yourself off as I have...

1403
01:34:16.338 --> 01:34:19.135
you know that.
Just talk to them again.

1404
01:34:20.433 --> 01:34:22.631
I know they'll listen to you, mate.

1405
01:34:25.029 --> 01:34:27.826
Okay Burt, I'll try.
See you tomorrow.

1406
01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:29.225
Okay.

1407
01:34:32.322 --> 01:34:36.018
I mean I'm half the age of some
of those characters out there.

1408
01:34:41.912 --> 01:34:43.311
What's that?

1409
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:45.309
That's just indigestion.

1410
01:34:51.003 --> 01:34:55.898
Everyone wants us old buggers
to curl up in some quiet corner and die.

1411
01:34:56.797 --> 01:35:00.593
Well, Burt Munro's not ready to finish
yet, I'll tell you that, mate.

1412
01:35:03.291 --> 01:35:05.688
I'll give it a shot
but I'm not promising anything.

1413
01:35:06.387 --> 01:35:08.286
Thanks, mate.
Thanks a lot.

1414
01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.577
<i>The famous Challenger One...</i>

1415
01:35:26.567 --> 01:35:28.266
What is he doing?

1416
01:35:28.565 --> 01:35:30.963
- Didn't Jim tell him?
- He says he did.

1417
01:35:31.462 --> 01:35:34.260
- Well, then what's he doing here?
- Why won't you let him run?

1418
01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.757
Hey, he's too old
and his bike's too old.

1419
01:35:37.057 --> 01:35:39.255
He's come half way round the world
to ride that cycle.

1420
01:35:39.554 --> 01:35:40.753
Yeah, come on.

1421
01:35:41.053 --> 01:35:45.049
- Wendy, if he was to kill himself.
- So? It's his life.

1422
01:35:45.948 --> 01:35:47.646
Keep an eye out
for those officials.

1423
01:35:47.746 --> 01:35:50.393
You sure you want to do this?
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

1424
01:35:50.394 --> 01:35:53.041
Hurry up. If we're going to do
this thing you've got to hurry.

1425
01:35:53.141 --> 01:35:55.139
Alright, let's go,
here's your helmet.

1426
01:35:57.137 --> 01:35:58.435
Here's your goggles.

1427
01:35:58.735 --> 01:36:00.633
- Come on, Burt. We've got to go.
- Yeah, right.

1428
01:36:00.733 --> 01:36:02.331
Come on, put them on.

1429
01:36:07.127 --> 01:36:08.325
Go, go, come on.

1430
01:36:12.621 --> 01:36:13.920
Okay, let's go, push.

1431
01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:15.918
Push, go fast.

1432
01:36:16.218 --> 01:36:17.416
Hey, you can't. Hey...

1433
01:36:18.016 --> 01:36:20.114
- you can't do that.
- Come on, come on!

1434
01:36:21.712 --> 01:36:23.011
Hang on!

1435
01:36:27.706 --> 01:36:29.304
Hey, where are you going with that?

1436
01:36:34.599 --> 01:36:36.597
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1437
01:36:37.496 --> 01:36:40.593
What the hell are you doing, Burt?
What the hell are you doing?

1438
01:36:40.993 --> 01:36:42.890
Just getting her warmed up, Bob.

1439
01:36:42.891 --> 01:36:44.389
Didn't look like you were
getting her warmed up.

1440
01:36:44.589 --> 01:36:46.887
Jesus, he was going to take
the thing for a freakin' run.

1441
01:36:46.888 --> 01:36:47.986
Bob.

1442
01:36:47.987 --> 01:36:49.085
Oh, boy.

1443
01:36:51.183 --> 01:36:54.779
That is the most determined man
I have ever seen in my entire life.

1444
01:36:55.478 --> 01:36:57.376
I kind of feel sorry
for the old cooty.

1445
01:36:58.975 --> 01:37:00.473
Coming all this way.

1446
01:37:00.973 --> 01:37:03.121
Isn't there some way
we can accommodate him?

1447
01:37:03.122 --> 01:37:05.268
I mean there can't be
much risk there...

1448
01:37:05.368 --> 01:37:08.265
his bike will be
lucky if it does 70.

1449
01:37:08.465 --> 01:37:11.762
What do you say? What if we bend
the rules this once, huh?

1450
01:37:14.259 --> 01:37:15.258
Jesus!

1451
01:37:18.455 --> 01:37:20.054
Bob and I had a little chat...

1452
01:37:20.253 --> 01:37:23.550
and we're thinking we're gonna
organize a handling run for you.

1453
01:37:24.449 --> 01:37:27.246
- You are? What?
- A handling run.

1454
01:37:27.646 --> 01:37:29.944
All the officials,
we're gonna get into our vehicles and...

1455
01:37:29.945 --> 01:37:31.142
- You're joking, huh?
- No, I'm not.

1456
01:37:31.143 --> 01:37:33.239
We're going to follow
along behind you...

1457
01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.238
and we're going to see
if you're okay to ride this beast.

1458
01:37:35.239 --> 01:37:36.336
Of course I'm okay to ride it.

1459
01:37:36.337 --> 01:37:39.534
First thing tomorrow morning, alright?
Bright and early.

1460
01:37:41.532 --> 01:37:42.831
Well, thanks fellas.

1461
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:45.928
Hey. My luck's in then.

1462
01:37:48.725 --> 01:37:50.523
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1463
01:37:50.623 --> 01:37:52.022
Don't hurt yourself.

1464
01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:06.907
Okay, everyone listen up.
This is what we're gonna do.

1465
01:38:07.306 --> 01:38:09.704
Burt, you're gonna get rolling...

1466
01:38:09.804 --> 01:38:13.600
ride slowly along. We'll all jump in
our vehicles, follow you down the track.

1467
01:38:13.601 --> 01:38:15.998
- See if you can handle this thing.
- I'll handle her alright.

1468
01:38:16.297 --> 01:38:17.896
Alright. Everybody got that?

1469
01:38:18.195 --> 01:38:20.693
Okay, everybody,
let's get in the cars.

1470
01:38:44.469 --> 01:38:46.767
Hope that old man doesn't make
a fool of himself.

1471
01:38:51.962 --> 01:38:53.061
Here we go.

1472
01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.558
I'm ready, let's go.

1473
01:38:56.157 --> 01:38:57.156
Push it!

1474
01:38:57.556 --> 01:38:59.055
Faster, boys.

1475
01:39:01.152 --> 01:39:02.351
Go, Burt!

1476
01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:27.926
Sixty.

1477
01:39:28.525 --> 01:39:30.024
Sixty-five, seventy.

1478
01:39:31.722 --> 01:39:32.921
That a boy, Burt.

1479
01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.119
Seventy-five.

1480
01:39:34.819 --> 01:39:37.616
There he goes up to eighty,
eighty, eighty five.

1481
01:39:42.211 --> 01:39:43.110
Ninety.

1482
01:39:50.503 --> 01:39:53.100
Ninety-five,
look at that thing go.

1483
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:06.587
- Holy smoke.
- He's leaving them behind!

1484
01:40:06.887 --> 01:40:08.684
What the hell is
that old guy up to?

1485
01:40:08.685 --> 01:40:10.483
Nobody told him
he could give it everything.

1486
01:40:10.683 --> 01:40:13.080
I guess that solves the question
of whether or not he can handle it.

1487
01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.478
We were doing ninety-five
and he left us in the dust.

1488
01:40:15.678 --> 01:40:17.076
Look at him go!

1489
01:40:17.276 --> 01:40:18.475
That a boy, go, Burt.

1490
01:40:57.836 --> 01:40:59.734
Hold her firm.

1491
01:40:59.934 --> 01:41:01.032
Hold her firm.

1492
01:41:01.332 --> 01:41:03.330
Got it? Don't let it go.

1493
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:06.227
That was a disaster!

1494
01:41:07.226 --> 01:41:10.223
- Hey, Burt. How'd it go.
- Not good.

1495
01:41:14.719 --> 01:41:16.217
So, what's the verdict?

1496
01:41:16.517 --> 01:41:19.414
When you opened up there in top
gear you sure left us in the dust.

1497
01:41:19.514 --> 01:41:22.011
I couldn't even get her out
of second gear, Earl.

1498
01:41:22.411 --> 01:41:26.307
The plugs were oiling up, I had to feed
her more juice up the revs a little.

1499
01:41:26.507 --> 01:41:29.504
Well, I guess we'll see if you're
telling us the truth, Munro.

1500
01:41:31.402 --> 01:41:34.499
Are you telling me I can officially run
on the track and have it timed?

1501
01:41:34.699 --> 01:41:36.297
That's what I'm saying, Burt.

1502
01:41:38.994 --> 01:41:41.292
You'll never know what
this means to me, Otto.

1503
01:41:41.392 --> 01:41:44.389
25 years I've lived for this day,
25 years.

1504
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:48.385
Sometimes you've got to bend the rules
a little, today's one of those days.

1505
01:41:48.885 --> 01:41:51.981
- Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.

1506
01:41:57.876 --> 01:42:00.573
- What did they say?
- What happened?

1507
01:42:02.271 --> 01:42:03.969
They said I could run.

1508
01:42:04.869 --> 01:42:06.067
That's great!

1509
01:42:06.667 --> 01:42:09.064
- So why the long face then?
- Well, I don't know...

1510
01:42:09.164 --> 01:42:12.561
it's just starting to sink in
and I've got a problem a big problem.

1511
01:42:12.761 --> 01:42:16.157
As soon as I go over a hundred and
ten it starts to wobble like heck...

1512
01:42:16.257 --> 01:42:17.755
a bad speed wobble.

1513
01:42:17.756 --> 01:42:21.252
Well, it did look like you were
about as stable as my last wife.

1514
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:25.548
I've got a theory
and I think I'm right.

1515
01:42:25.648 --> 01:42:28.445
I need about twenty car batteries.

1516
01:42:28.545 --> 01:42:29.444
Twenty?

1517
01:42:30.343 --> 01:42:32.441
Is it ok to steel
these batteries, Burt?

1518
01:42:32.741 --> 01:42:34.539
We're not steeling them Marty,
we're souveniring them.

1519
01:42:34.639 --> 01:42:36.437
Careful of that acid there.

1520
01:42:36.837 --> 01:42:38.435
What do we do
with them now?

1521
01:42:38.635 --> 01:42:41.332
Well, we're going to talk someone
into lending us a painter's blow torch.

1522
01:42:41.632 --> 01:42:43.030
A painter's blow torch?

1523
01:42:45.428 --> 01:42:47.925
What are we going to do
with all this metal, Burt?

1524
01:42:48.425 --> 01:42:53.420
Well, when this cools down,
we'll have ourselves a lead brick.

1525
01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.516
- What do you do with a lead brick?
- Place it in the front of the motorcycle.

1526
01:42:58.215 --> 01:43:00.313
- And that's your plan?
- Yeah.

1527
01:43:01.412 --> 01:43:05.907
Well, you must get the centre
of pressure behind the centre of gravity...

1528
01:43:06.007 --> 01:43:09.004
and if you don't get it right
then she'll start to fish tail...

1529
01:43:09.005 --> 01:43:12.001
- when you get her wound up.
- What do you mean by fish tail?

1530
01:43:12.201 --> 01:43:15.148
Well, like a fish's behind you know.
It'll start doing that.

1531
01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:18.095
And that's what happened today
when I had the handling run.

1532
01:43:18.295 --> 01:43:21.991
And so in a panic I lifted my head up
from behind the screen...

1533
01:43:22.291 --> 01:43:25.987
and suddenly the bike started
to go straight and...

1534
01:43:26.287 --> 01:43:30.583
I knew I'd solved the problem somehow
by sticking my head up into the wind.

1535
01:43:31.682 --> 01:43:33.180
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

1536
01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:35.578
Well, I'll show you.
Let me have that.

1537
01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:38.475
What are you doing?

1538
01:43:38.675 --> 01:43:42.271
Imagine the cigar
is my streamliner.

1539
01:43:42.371 --> 01:43:43.969
Don't poke holes in the cigar.

1540
01:43:44.269 --> 01:43:47.366
Now if I hold it in the middle
and blow on it. Like so.

1541
01:43:49.164 --> 01:43:50.962
See how unstable it is?

1542
01:43:51.162 --> 01:43:52.461
Now if I...

1543
01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.458
- shift the...
- Not again!

1544
01:43:55.758 --> 01:43:58.255
Centre of pressure here.
And blow on it.

1545
01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:04.649
See it's much more stable.

1546
01:44:04.848 --> 01:44:09.044
Just the centre of pressure
is behind the centre of gravity...

1547
01:44:09.344 --> 01:44:12.141
and that's what I'm trying to fix
with the lead brick you see.

1548
01:44:12.341 --> 01:44:13.939
You're quite clever,
did you know that, Burt?

1549
01:44:14.239 --> 01:44:17.736
Now all I need to do is to test
my theory before I run on the salt...

1550
01:44:17.935 --> 01:44:18.833
and I was thinking of,
you know...

1551
01:44:18.834 --> 01:44:22.431
crossing over the state line
from here in Utah to Nevada...

1552
01:44:22.631 --> 01:44:26.727
where there's no speed limit and running
with a lead brick in the front of it.

1553
01:45:16.976 --> 01:45:18.475
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1554
01:45:18.874 --> 01:45:20.872
Do you know how fast you were
going back there?

1555
01:45:20.972 --> 01:45:22.271
Yeah, about...

1556
01:45:22.770 --> 01:45:25.168
150, 160 miles an hour.

1557
01:45:28.065 --> 01:45:30.163
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1558
01:45:31.162 --> 01:45:32.860
How's he going to talk
his way out of this one?

1559
01:45:33.759 --> 01:45:36.856
He sure got his arse
in a sling this time, don't he?

1560
01:45:37.156 --> 01:45:40.852
So what's the situation with this thing?
You don't have any license plates on it.

1561
01:45:41.052 --> 01:45:44.349
- It's registered in New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

1562
01:45:44.449 --> 01:45:46.746
Yeah, that's where I come from.

1563
01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:51.740
Alright, you mean to tell me...

1564
01:45:51.741 --> 01:45:54.439
that this contraption of yours
is registered for the road?

1565
01:45:55.538 --> 01:45:58.734
- Yeah, in New Zealand.
- New Zealand, right.

1566
01:45:59.234 --> 01:46:02.531
Well, how about taking it easy
here in Nevada?

1567
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:04.827
Just because we don't have
a speed limit don't mean...

1568
01:46:04.828 --> 01:46:08.325
- we want people killing themselves.
- No, sounds fair enough to me.

1569
01:46:09.224 --> 01:46:12.221
- Right, you have a good day then.
- I will, thank you.

1570
01:46:12.222 --> 01:46:13.520
Burt, everything OK?

1571
01:46:15.218 --> 01:46:19.014
Well, fellows, we're going to have
to give the lead brick...

1572
01:46:19.114 --> 01:46:21.112
the old Spanish archer.

1573
01:46:21.412 --> 01:46:24.409
- Spanish archer?
- Yeah, the big elbow, you know.

1574
01:46:25.308 --> 01:46:27.206
The lead brick has got to go.

1575
01:46:27.506 --> 01:46:29.803
Who's stupid idea was that anyway?

1576
01:46:30.003 --> 01:46:30.802
It was yours.

1577
01:46:30.902 --> 01:46:35.697
Yeah. Well, I'm just going to have
to ride her, the way she is.

1578
01:46:36.097 --> 01:46:37.396
What about that speed wobble?

1579
01:46:37.695 --> 01:46:40.992
Well, I'll cross that bridge
when I get there.

1580
01:46:41.392 --> 01:46:43.889
- I've got another problem too.
- Yeah, what now?

1581
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:46.686
Well, when I get her going...

1582
01:46:46.886 --> 01:46:50.583
there's an enormous amount of heat
comes off the exhaust pipe...

1583
01:46:50.882 --> 01:46:54.179
and I hope
it doesn't cook my leg.

1584
01:46:54.978 --> 01:46:59.174
Maybe you can wrap some asbestos cloth
around it, that should fix it right.

1585
01:46:59.175 --> 01:47:00.473
That's a good idea.

1586
01:47:01.072 --> 01:47:03.570
So you got any more problems
you want to tell us about?

1587
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:05.667
Yes, yes, my old ticker.

1588
01:47:06.467 --> 01:47:08.964
- You've got a bad heart?
- Yes, I have.

1589
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.958
I've got a little surprise
for you.

1590
01:47:15.458 --> 01:47:18.255
- What?
- Close your eyes and give me your hand.

1591
01:47:18.455 --> 01:47:20.952
- What?
- Just close your eyes. Come on.

1592
01:47:21.252 --> 01:47:23.749
- What for?
- Because I said so, mister, come on.

1593
01:47:26.547 --> 01:47:27.945
Keep walking.

1594
01:47:28.045 --> 01:47:31.641
Wendy, you're not going to make
a fool of an old man I hope.

1595
01:47:31.741 --> 01:47:33.340
I'd never do that, Burt.

1596
01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:34.638
Never.

1597
01:47:34.938 --> 01:47:36.337
Never. Okay. Okay.

1598
01:47:36.636 --> 01:47:38.135
Now turn around.

1599
01:47:38.734 --> 01:47:40.032
Alright.

1600
01:47:40.033 --> 01:47:41.931
Now, hold your hands out.

1601
01:47:42.531 --> 01:47:44.129
Put that in your pocket.

1602
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:45.328
Alright.

1603
01:47:45.528 --> 01:47:46.626
There we go good.

1604
01:47:47.925 --> 01:47:49.424
You can open them.

1605
01:48:04.509 --> 01:48:06.307
What are you all staring at?

1606
01:48:08.105 --> 01:48:10.103
- What is this?
- Burt...

1607
01:48:10.303 --> 01:48:14.099
we've unanimously voted you here on
the Salt planes, sportsman of the year...

1608
01:48:14.299 --> 01:48:17.695
because we figured nobody has
ever travelled as far as you have...

1609
01:48:17.696 --> 01:48:18.994
to be here for speed week...

1610
01:48:19.094 --> 01:48:22.790
so normally we would present
a trophy or something like that...

1611
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:25.987
but considering your case
we thought a few extra dollars...

1612
01:48:25.988 --> 01:48:28.884
would be more appreciated
so we past the hat around.

1613
01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.979
My goodness!

1614
01:48:36.976 --> 01:48:38.674
There are no words.

1615
01:48:52.361 --> 01:48:53.959
Well, thank you all.

1616
01:48:54.758 --> 01:48:56.856
Thank you all very much.

1617
01:48:58.554 --> 01:49:00.952
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

1618
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:05.448
Oh dear, it's quite
overwhelming you know...

1619
01:49:05.747 --> 01:49:08.245
it's 25 years dream
to come here.

1620
01:49:11.242 --> 01:49:16.137
I should try
to justify you, your respect and...

1621
01:49:17.236 --> 01:49:22.131
you know the original speed
of my old bike was 54 miles an hour.

1622
01:49:25.128 --> 01:49:29.424
And today I'm hoping to,
you know, improve it a little.

1623
01:49:39.613 --> 01:49:42.910
<i>The cars are at the start line now.
The next one is the 86...</i>

1624
01:49:43.210 --> 01:49:46.606
<i>On the bucket seat
the pilot is ready to be pushed out.</i>

1625
01:49:56.297 --> 01:49:57.995
<i>Next competitor is Burt Munro.</i>

1626
01:49:58.794 --> 01:50:01.791
<i>All the way from Invercargill,
New Zealand.</i>

1627
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:06.287
<i>Burt Munro's entry
was approved just yesterday.</i>

1628
01:50:14.678 --> 01:50:16.277
Burt, where'd you get this stuff?

1629
01:50:16.377 --> 01:50:18.474
- What?
- I say, where'd you get this stuff?

1630
01:50:18.774 --> 01:50:22.570
I tore an old electric blanket apart
and got the asbestos cloth out of it.

1631
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:25.167
You got those heart pills?

1632
01:50:25.168 --> 01:50:27.465
- Are you okay?
- Better take one, yeah.

1633
01:50:27.765 --> 01:50:29.314
They're almost ready.

1634
01:50:29.315 --> 01:50:30.862
Guys, come on, let's go.

1635
01:50:31.961 --> 01:50:34.359
You know the bottle says
that they may cause drowsiness...

1636
01:50:34.359 --> 01:50:36.756
- do not operate machinery.
- I know that.

1637
01:50:37.356 --> 01:50:39.154
Well, you're not supposed
to take two of them anyway.

1638
01:50:39.453 --> 01:50:41.551
One for me
and one for the old girl.

1639
01:50:41.851 --> 01:50:43.350
Nitro-glycerine.

1640
01:50:43.549 --> 01:50:45.048
Should make it go faster.

1641
01:50:45.647 --> 01:50:47.146
Have some of this, love.

1642
01:50:51.142 --> 01:50:52.341
There you go.

1643
01:50:58.834 --> 01:51:01.431
- Yeah, we're almost there.
- Alright, here we go.

1644
01:51:02.131 --> 01:51:03.529
- Hold her still.
- Your goggles.

1645
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:04.528
- What?
- Goggles.

1646
01:51:04.628 --> 01:51:06.926
- Put your goggles on.
- I know, calm down.

1647
01:51:10.722 --> 01:51:15.417
I can't get my leg in because
of the asbestos cloth on it.

1648
01:51:23.509 --> 01:51:24.808
Let me take it off.

1649
01:51:25.108 --> 01:51:28.704
- What about your leg in that heat?
- Screw it, I've got a spare one.

1650
01:51:30.802 --> 01:51:32.400
Right, Burt.

1651
01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:33.999
Get those goggles.

1652
01:51:35.098 --> 01:51:37.495
- Ready?
- Alright, you know the way.

1653
01:51:37.795 --> 01:51:38.694
Make sure you come back.

1654
01:51:38.894 --> 01:51:40.093
Come on, let's go!

1655
01:51:40.392 --> 01:51:41.591
Right, push!

1656
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:44.388
Come on, fellas. Push faster!

1657
01:51:46.486 --> 01:51:47.685
Keep running.

1658
01:51:51.182 --> 01:51:52.980
Keep it straight, buddy.

1659
01:51:54.678 --> 01:51:56.876
Bring it in, Burt. Come on.
Go, go, go...

1660
01:51:57.276 --> 01:51:58.474
Let's go, Burt!

1661
01:52:04.269 --> 01:52:05.168
Come on, Burt!

1662
01:52:05.867 --> 01:52:07.465
You can do it, Burt.

1663
01:52:07.765 --> 01:52:09.963
He's got no parachute,
he's got no brakes.

1664
01:52:29.443 --> 01:52:31.341
158.647.

1665
01:52:31.841 --> 01:52:35.238
Mile one,
158.647 miles per hour.

1666
01:52:35.437 --> 01:52:36.736
Go, Burt!

1667
01:52:37.036 --> 01:52:38.834
- Go on!
- Go, Burt!

1668
01:52:39.333 --> 01:52:41.431
- Make us proud, honey!
- Burt!

1669
01:52:56.416 --> 01:52:58.414
167.921.

1670
01:52:58.614 --> 01:53:02.211
Mile two,
167.921 miles per hour.

1671
01:53:02.410 --> 01:53:05.008
Break it, Burt.
Come on! Go, go, go!

1672
01:53:05.108 --> 01:53:06.107
Come on, Burt.

1673

<i>Mile three,

1676
01:53:37.475 --> 01:53:38.374

01:53:38.674 --> 01:53:39.573
Come on!

Come on, come on!

1682
01:54:17.136 --> 01:54:19.433
Come on, Burt.
You can do it!

1683
01:54:19.633 --> 01:54:20.732
Come on, Burt!

1685
01:54:25.327 --> 01:54:27.825
- Go, Burt!
- Burt, go!

1686
01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:13.379
What is it?

1687
01:55:14.378 --> 01:55:16.376

1688
01:55:16.776 --> 01:55:21.371
Mile eight,
201.851 miles per hour.

1689
01:55:29.064 --> 01:55:31.661
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's a new record...

1690
01:55:31.861 --> 01:55:35.957
201.851 miles per hour.

1691
01:55:38.454 --> 01:55:40.552
Burt, I hope you're going
to stop soon.

1692
01:55:40.952 --> 01:55:43.749
- He's gone back!
- Back where?

1693
01:55:44.049 --> 01:55:48.045
Back to whatever planet he came from
because he sure ain't from this one.

1694
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:43.989
I really did toast my leg.

1695
01:56:49.683 --> 01:56:50.882
I did it.

1696
01:56:51.681 --> 01:56:52.780
I did it.

1697
01:57:22.850 --> 01:57:25.547
Tom, can you get that,
my hands are wet.

1698
01:57:30.942 --> 01:57:32.139
Hello?

1699
01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:35.837
<i>This is the United States calling I have
a collect call from Mr. Burt Munro...</i>

1700
01:57:36.036 --> 01:57:37.335
<i>will you accept the charge?</i>

1701
01:57:37.435 --> 01:57:41.731
- Mum, it's Burt calling collect.
- It is? Accept the call, accept the call!

1702
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:43.329
My mum said we can accept the call.

1703
01:57:43.429 --> 01:57:46.226
<i>- Go ahead, sir.
- Hello Tom, is that you?</i>

1704
01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:48.524
<i>- Yes.
- It's me, Burt.</i>

1705
01:57:48.724 --> 01:57:52.220
<i>I did it Tom,
she's the world's fastest Indian.</i>

1706
01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:53.219
She is?

1707
01:57:53.519 --> 01:57:54.718
Dad, dad!

1708
01:57:55.317 --> 01:57:58.214
Dad! He did it! Burt did it!

1709
01:57:58.514 --> 01:57:59.913
He set a new record.

1710
01:58:18.594 --> 01:58:19.593
How is it going?

1711
01:58:19.693 --> 01:58:21.091
Hello, mate!

1712
01:58:21.191 --> 01:58:22.590
- Hey, Duncan.
- Congratulations, Burt.

1713
01:58:22.591 --> 01:58:23.988
Hello, Frank.
How are you?

1714
01:58:24.188 --> 01:58:26.186
- Welcome home, Burt.
- Hello, George.

1715
01:58:26.286 --> 01:58:29.583
My goodness, you've made
this place look spiffing, mate.

1716
01:58:29.883 --> 01:58:31.080
You did us proud.

1717
01:58:31.081 --> 01:58:34.578
- You put Invercargill on the map.
- Well, I reckon so, yeah.

1718
01:58:34.678 --> 01:58:37.375
- What have you got planned now?
- Right now I've a lot of work to do...

1719
01:58:37.475 --> 01:58:40.272
if I'm to get back to Bonneville
next year, you know.

1720
01:58:40.372 --> 01:58:42.570
So, more early mornings then?

1721
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:44.568
Yeah, more early mornings.

1722
01:58:44.768 --> 01:58:45.965
Hello, love.

1723
01:58:45.966 --> 01:58:48.264
- Welcome home.
- Nice to be back.

1724
01:58:49.463 --> 01:58:51.361
- Hello, Tom.
- Hey, Burt.

1725
01:58:51.661 --> 01:58:53.259
How are you, son?

1726
01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:54.957
Good to see ya.

1727
01:58:55.257 --> 01:58:56.856
You're growing up a bit, huh?

1728
01:58:57.455 --> 01:58:59.453
I looked after your lemon tree
just like you told me.

1729
01:58:59.553 --> 01:59:00.852
You did, yeah.

1730
01:59:01.051 --> 01:59:02.350
Looking good, too.

1731
01:59:02.850 --> 01:59:04.048
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1732
01:59:05.347 --> 01:59:07.345
- I fed the chickens.
- You did?

1733
01:59:07.545 --> 01:59:09.443
- And mum cooked all the eggs.
- Oh, yeah...

1734
01:59:09.743 --> 01:59:11.741
- did they taste good?
- Yep.

1735
01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:13.839
- Yeah, good. Have you got my key?
- Here it is.

1736
01:59:13.839 --> 01:59:15.237
- Right thanks.
- I took good care of it.

1737
01:59:15.637 --> 01:59:18.134
- I knew you would.
- How fast did you go?

1738
01:59:18.334 --> 01:59:21.631
Mighty fast. In one of my runs
I did over 200 miles an hour.

1739
01:59:21.930 --> 01:59:24.828
What would happen if you opened
your mouth at that speed?

1740
01:59:25.127 --> 01:59:27.425
Well, you'd blow the backside
out of your pants I reckon.

1741
01:59:29.623 --> 01:59:30.822
Right, let's see.

1742
01:59:33.419 --> 01:59:36.316
Nice to be home.
Back in my shed.
