00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:40.256
Sixty-eight, 69, 70...

2
00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:43.092
71, 72...

3
00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:45.761
73...

4
00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.471
74...

5
00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.265
75...

6
00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:51.308
76...

7
00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.018
77...

8
00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:54.979

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:56.689

10
00:01:56.857 --> 00:01:58.440

12
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.027
82...

13
00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:03.904
83...

14
00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:05.781
84...

15
00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:07.449
85...

16
00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:09.326
86...

17
00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:12.454
Ninety-seven, 98...

18
00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:15.499
99, 100.

19
00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:57.893
Burt! Shut that bloody thing off!

20
00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:01.730
Do you know what time it is?

21
00:04:01.898 --> 00:04:06.235
Burt! Burt!
You stupid old bastard!

22
00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:07.861
What do you think you're doing?

23
00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.072
Sorry, George. What'd you say?

24
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.824
Do you know what time it is?

25
00:04:11.992 --> 00:04:14.576
I'm sorry. I've got a heck of a lot
to get done today.

26
00:04:14.744 --> 00:04:18.706
Right. And you know what they say,
the early bird catches the worm.

27
00:04:18.873 --> 00:04:22.835
Well, if you do this again one more time,
I'm calling the cops!

28
00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:26.588
And how about mowing your lawn?

29
00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:29.842
It's a bloody disgrace to the neighborhood.

30
00:04:34.097 --> 00:04:35.347
Yeah. All right.

31
00:04:42.355 --> 00:04:43.689
Hi, kid.

32
00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:05.419
Here we are. The perfect recipe.

33
00:05:05.587 --> 00:05:08.464
Two of Chevy...

34
00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:10.090
one of Ford.

35
00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:17.848
I think those '36 Chevy pistons...

36
00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:20.642
must have a touch of titanium
or something in them.

37
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.437
They come out real good, you know?

38
00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:25.022
Hey, the kettle's boiling.

39
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.816
Make yourself useful.
Make some tea.

40
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:36.533
- Can we have a biscuit too?
- What?

41
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:38.077
Can I have a ginger nat?

42
00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:40.788
Yeah. You know where they are.
Help yourself.

43
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:47.961
No. You stay over there.
Stay there.

44
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.389
- All right.
- What are you doing for Christmas, Burt?

45
00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:01.600
Christmas? I don't know. Why?

46
00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:03.769
Are you angling for a present or something?

47
00:06:03.937 --> 00:06:05.771
No. I wondered if you were going away.

48
00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.941
No. No time for Christmas, lad.

49
00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:11.026
Got a lot of work to do.

50
00:06:11.194 --> 00:06:13.862
I only managed 27 test runs this year.

51
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.658
You know, 24 on the beach
and three on the road...

52
00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:19.743
all illegal like.

53
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.413
I was going a bit over the speed limit,
I have to admit.

54
00:06:23.581 --> 00:06:25.916
- How fast were you going?
- I don't know. Haven't a clue.

55
00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:29.711
That's why I gotta get
it up to Bonneville...

56
00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.506
find out how fast she will go.

57
00:06:48.148 --> 00:06:49.481
Now, there you go.

58
00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:53.152
Go and get the piston out of the mold.

59
00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.028
Bob's your uncle.

60
00:06:55.196 --> 00:07:00.159
Now, this is the last part
of the operation...

61
00:07:00.326 --> 00:07:02.035
to chill the metal.

62
00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:03.745
It heat-treats it.

63
00:07:03.913 --> 00:07:05.998
All right. Watch yourself.

64
00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:10.669
That's where I got the water
for the kettle from.

65
00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:16.091
Yeah, well, that gives the tea
a nice tang of titanium, doesn't it?

66
00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.510
This bloke, he once asked me, he said:

67
00:07:18.678 --> 00:07:21.263
"How do you heat-treat
your pistons, Burt?"

68
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:23.515
And I said, "I don't, mate.

69
00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:26.602
I just, you know, bang them in cold water
and Bob's your uncle."

70
00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:29.479
And he said, "Well, that's
the heat treatment," he said.

71
00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:33.108
And he just laughed and shook his head
and walked away like, and...

72
00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:36.695
Oh, Lord, this could be the perfect piston.

73
00:07:36.863 --> 00:07:39.364
It blooming well ought to be.
I've made hundreds of them.

74
00:07:39.532 --> 00:07:43.785
Look at them all up there,
all blown to smithereens.

75
00:07:43.953 --> 00:07:45.621
You made all those?

76
00:07:45.788 --> 00:07:47.623
Yeah, I did. Look. Perfect.

77
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.125
Beautiful. No inclusion, see?

78
00:07:50.293 --> 00:07:55.547
Tommy, does your mother have
a carving knife I could borrow?

79
00:07:55.715 --> 00:07:56.965
A carving knife? Yeah.

80
00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:59.218
Yeah. We need a good, sharp knife.

81
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:08.769
Okay. All right. Hang on.

82
00:08:08.937 --> 00:08:10.604
Thomas, what are you up to?

83
00:08:10.772 --> 00:08:13.148
Nothing, mom. Can I have some
bread and peanut butter?

84
00:08:13.316 --> 00:08:16.735
Okay, but make sure you put everything
away when you've finished.

85
00:08:17.237 --> 00:08:18.946
Sorry about that. Yeah.

86
00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:24.326
Really?

87
00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:30.749
Tom, don't forget the wood.

88
00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:33.001
No, Mom.

89
00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:39.007
All right.

90
00:08:39.175 --> 00:08:44.054
I have to get as much
rubber off as possible.

91
00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:47.224
It has to be perfectly bald
like that, you see?

92
00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:49.893
- Why's that?
- Well, at high speed...

93
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:55.065
the centrifugal force expands the tire...

94
00:08:55.233 --> 00:09:00.529
and it rubs against the frame of the bike.

95
00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:03.198
Have to be careful not to cut
through the cords, though.

96
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.829
- Why do you pee on your lemon tree?
- What?

97
00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:12.374
Why do you pee on your lemon tree?

98
00:09:14.294 --> 00:09:15.711
Who says I do that?

99
00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:18.922
Mom says she sees you every morning.
She goes on and on about it.

100
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.132
Oh, does she?

101
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.301
Yeah? Oh, well.

102
00:09:22.468 --> 00:09:24.428
Well, it's good fertilizer, you know.

103
00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:27.639
You shouldn't waste anything
in this world, sonny.

104
00:09:27.807 --> 00:09:30.225
- Well, I better be off home.
- All right, then.

105
00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:32.561
Mom gets a bit cross
if I stay over here too long.

106
00:09:32.729 --> 00:09:35.397
She does? Well...

107
00:09:35.732 --> 00:09:37.316
Are you finished with the knife?

108
00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:40.652
Not yet. I'll drop it by later.

109
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.947
No. Don't do that. I'll pick it up
after school tomorrow.

110
00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:45.615
All right.

111
00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:50.078
- Bye!
- Cheerio!

112
00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:59.087
- Burt Munro.
- Yeah?

113
00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:02.424
- I believe you have my carving knife.
- Oh, yes.

114
00:10:02.592 --> 00:10:05.260
- And my sharpener.
- Yeah.

115
00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:08.221
Oh, here we are.

116
00:10:09.432 --> 00:10:13.310
Here. Well, thanks a lot, love.

117
00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:24.905
- Good day, Frank, how are you?
- Oh, not bad.

118
00:10:25.073 --> 00:10:27.115
- It could be better, it could be worse.
- Good.

119
00:10:27.283 --> 00:10:30.619
I see your front tire's gone
a bit flat on you there, Burt.

120
00:10:30.787 --> 00:10:33.789
Oh, yeah. Well, the good news is
it's only flat on the bottom.

121
00:10:33.956 --> 00:10:35.957
I'll see you tomorrow night
for the fun and games.

122
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:37.459
All right. It'll be a good one.

123
00:10:40.129 --> 00:10:42.547
Hello, Fran. Uh...

124
00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:44.758
Give us the lot, will you? The usual.

125
00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:47.177
One pension check coming up.

126
00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:51.431
Fran, I want to ask you a question...

127
00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:53.809
the answer to which is...

128
00:10:53.976 --> 00:10:56.311
you know, a definite yes.

129
00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:58.188
All right. Ready?

130
00:10:58.356 --> 00:11:03.235
All right. Yes.
What's the question, Burt?

131
00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:05.904
Would you feel inclined to, you know...

132
00:11:06.072 --> 00:11:08.907
accompany an impeccable young gentleman...

133
00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:12.452
to a local do tomorrow night?

134
00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:16.540
Are you asking me on a date, Burt Munro?

135
00:11:16.707 --> 00:11:19.000
Well, yeah, I suppose I am,
actually, aren't I?

136
00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:22.838
- Would you?
- You're on.

137
00:11:29.345 --> 00:11:31.304
- Hello, son.
- Hey, Burt.

138
00:11:32.056 --> 00:11:33.682
That's disgusting!

139
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.643
Yeah. It is, isn't it?

140
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:41.398
I'm all dressed up for the do tonight
and I couldn't get my best shoes on...

141
00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:44.776
because my toenails
had grown like oyster shells.

142
00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:49.322
Anyway, this should do the trick.

143
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.907
There. Look at that.

144
00:11:51.075 --> 00:11:52.534
Little twinkle-toes.

145
00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:02.711
- Thanks, Burt.
- Right-o.

146
00:12:07.884 --> 00:12:11.219
- Hey, Burt!
- Hi.

147
00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:13.054
- Evening, Burt.
- Thank you. Thank you.

148
00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:15.182
- This is Fran.
- Hi, Fran.

149
00:12:15.349 --> 00:12:17.017
Thank you very much.

150
00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:19.728
- Hello, Duncan!
- Burt!

151
00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:23.648
I'm just gonna say hello to the lads
and then I'll be back in a second, love.

152
00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:25.734
Hello, Pete. Hello, Graham.

153
00:12:25.902 --> 00:12:27.986
- You doing well?
- Yeah. Not bad.

154
00:12:28.946 --> 00:12:30.739
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Thanks a lot, mate.

155
00:12:30.907 --> 00:12:33.909
- This is a bit of a surprise, isn't it?
- Hey, Burt.

156
00:12:34.076 --> 00:12:36.411
Would you like to buy
a raffle ticket or two?

157
00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:37.996
What's it for?

158
00:12:38.164 --> 00:12:40.040
Porky the pig, plus two dozen beers.

159
00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:42.083
We're raising money
to send Burt to the U.S.A.

160
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.002
Our mate Burt.

161
00:12:45.421 --> 00:12:48.381
- Come on, Burt. Come and dance.
- Hello, love.

162
00:12:48.549 --> 00:12:52.093
- What's this? The twist?
- This is the twist. You know the twist?

163
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:55.305
- No.
- Come twist with me.

164
00:12:57.308 --> 00:12:59.142
See? You can twist.

165
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:03.939
That's it, that's it.

166
00:13:05.608 --> 00:13:08.318
When the air clears
And the dust settles down

167
00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:11.613
You look outside
Have they leveled the town?

168
00:13:11.781 --> 00:13:16.076
But there in the yard So briskly alive

169
00:13:16.244 --> 00:13:21.081
Stands Burt Munro's
Trusty old Indian Scout 45

170
00:13:23.334 --> 00:13:25.377
Thank you, mate.

171
00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:29.798
That was a wonderful tribute to Burt.
Now, come on, Burt.

172
00:13:29.966 --> 00:13:31.132
We want you up on stage.

173
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.302
Come on, come on. Up you come.

174
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:40.475
And I hope all of you have bought
a raffle ticket tonight...

175
00:13:40.643 --> 00:13:44.771
because we believe Burt will put
the Southland Motorcycle Club...

176
00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:46.856
on the map!

177
00:13:56.576 --> 00:13:58.159
What's going on out there?

178
00:13:58.828 --> 00:14:01.329
Get out of here!

179
00:14:02.331 --> 00:14:04.958
- Oh, dear.
- What's this?

180
00:14:10.798 --> 00:14:14.718
Well, folks, it looks like I've cracked it.
I've, you know...

181
00:14:14.885 --> 00:14:16.261
You Burt Munro?

182
00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:18.430
The, uh... What'd he say?

183
00:14:18.598 --> 00:14:19.723
I said, are you Burt Munro?

184
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.017
Are you looking for old Burt?

185
00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:24.019
Why, no. Have you
seen Burt anywhere?

186
00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:27.856
Anyone seen Burt? Well, no...

187
00:14:28.024 --> 00:14:29.107
You are. You're Burt Munro.

188
00:14:29.275 --> 00:14:31.359
You're the old codger that rides
the Army Indian.

189
00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:35.030
Oh, that old joker. Burt Munro, yeah.

190
00:14:35.197 --> 00:14:37.032
Yeah, that's me, I think. Oh, yeah.

191
00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:41.411
Now, the... Young fellow,
the Army Indian is a real dog.

192
00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:45.332
What I've got is the genuine article...

193
00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:48.877
the 1920 V-twin Scout.

194
00:14:49.045 --> 00:14:50.629
That's the one with the pedals, right?

195
00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:53.673
- Yeah, right.
- Good job, Burt.

196
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:58.637
Well, I don't know what sort of push bikes
you monkeys came here into town on...

197
00:14:58.804 --> 00:15:03.975
but I know that my old-timer would thrash
the backsides off whatever they are.

198
00:15:04.143 --> 00:15:05.602
No, I don't think so, grandad.

199
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.314
No? Why don't you chumps...

200
00:15:09.482 --> 00:15:11.900
put your money where your mouth is, then?

201
00:15:12.068 --> 00:15:14.569
You're on, you old coot.

202
00:15:15.613 --> 00:15:17.697
Right. Yeah.

203
00:15:17.865 --> 00:15:20.075
- Looks like they've chickened out, Burt.
- What?

204
00:15:20.242 --> 00:15:21.618
Looks like they've chickened out.

205
00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:23.745
- They're here.
- What?

206
00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:25.538
They're here.

207
00:15:29.877 --> 00:15:31.586
It's nice of them to show up, isn't it?

208
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.888
A hundred says the Indian comes last.

209
00:15:42.056 --> 00:15:43.264
Right, mate.

210
00:16:06.288 --> 00:16:07.288
Come on!

211
00:16:12.128 --> 00:16:14.295
Go!

212
00:16:17.758 --> 00:16:19.426
Come on! Give me a push!

213
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:23.513
- Now you're talking!
- Come on, Burt!

214
00:16:23.681 --> 00:16:24.806
Give me a push!

215
00:16:24.974 --> 00:16:27.058
Come on, push hard!

216
00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:30.478
Go, Burt!

217
00:16:32.606 --> 00:16:33.857
Go, Burt!

218
00:16:35.276 --> 00:16:36.901
Come on! Go!

219
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:22.197
Bugger.

220
00:17:22.364 --> 00:17:23.948
Nice bike, grandad.

221
00:17:24.116 --> 00:17:25.950
Loser!

222
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.036
Yee-ha!

223
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.887
- Well, thanks, fellas.
- Better luck next time.

224
00:17:46.055 --> 00:17:47.722
- Yeah.
- Bad luck, Burt.

225
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:54.771
Here you go. Oh, thanks, love.

226
00:17:54.939 --> 00:17:56.314
- Careful, it's hot.
- All right.

227
00:17:58.067 --> 00:18:01.402
Well, at least I gave them
a good run for their money.

228
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.239
On the downward leg, anyway.

229
00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:07.617
Burt, what's it gonna cost
to get over to America?

230
00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:09.410
Sorry, love. What'd you say?

231
00:18:09.578 --> 00:18:12.038
How much is it gonna cost
to get over to America?

232
00:18:12.206 --> 00:18:15.458
Oh, I don't know. About 2000, I'm told.

233
00:18:15.626 --> 00:18:17.252
And how much money have you got now?

234
00:18:18.087 --> 00:18:21.047
Well, apart from today's disaster...

235
00:18:21.215 --> 00:18:23.174
and the dough from last night...

236
00:18:23.342 --> 00:18:26.719
and the pension money I've been saving...

237
00:18:26.887 --> 00:18:32.141
about 1275 dollars,
United States dollars, I reckon.

238
00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:34.269
Well, I could lend you some money.

239
00:18:34.436 --> 00:18:38.565
Oh, that's very kind of you, Fran,
but, no, I couldn't do that, love.

240
00:18:38.732 --> 00:18:39.941
No. Thanks.

241
00:18:40.109 --> 00:18:42.652
Well, there must be something you can do.

242
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.779
Well, I haven't told
anyone else this, Fran...

243
00:18:44.947 --> 00:18:48.449
but I don't reckon
I'll be going to Bonneville.

244
00:18:48.617 --> 00:18:49.951
I mean, not this year, anyway.

245
00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:55.248
And, you know, $700
is a lot of money to find...

246
00:18:55.416 --> 00:18:58.793
and the boat leaves in five days...

247
00:18:58.961 --> 00:19:01.629
but, you know...

248
00:19:01.797 --> 00:19:06.092
Except I would like to see
how fast she'll really go...

249
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.095
before I fall off the perch, as it were...

250
00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:12.140
before I, you know, kick the old bucket.

251
00:19:12.308 --> 00:19:14.058
Oh, well. Huh.

252
00:19:21.817 --> 00:19:23.234
Hello, Lloyd.

253
00:19:23.402 --> 00:19:25.987
Good day, Burt.
Shame about the fall.

254
00:19:26.155 --> 00:19:28.323
Yeah, well, I'm still
in one piece, aren't I?

255
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.325
Yeah. What are you having tonight?

256
00:19:30.492 --> 00:19:33.286
Specialty of the house, Pea, Pie 'n' Pudd.

257
00:19:33.454 --> 00:19:35.496
- It's 5 bob.
- All right.

258
00:19:35.664 --> 00:19:36.664
- Burt.
- Yeah?

259
00:19:36.832 --> 00:19:39.083
Why don't you take out
a mortgage on your house?

260
00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:41.085
- What house?
- Oh, your property.

261
00:19:41.253 --> 00:19:42.879
I mean, it's worth something.

262
00:19:43.047 --> 00:19:46.007
Yeah. Here you are.

263
00:19:46.175 --> 00:19:48.593
Burt Munro, look at
the color of your hands.

264
00:19:48.761 --> 00:19:51.321
- What's the matter with them?
- You're gonna wash those mitts...

265
00:19:51.388 --> 00:19:53.348
before you put them anywhere near me.

266
00:19:53.515 --> 00:19:55.516
Here we are.

267
00:20:28.092 --> 00:20:30.259
Wakey, wakey.

268
00:20:30.427 --> 00:20:35.014
Time to rise and shine.

269
00:20:35.182 --> 00:20:38.559
Oh, Burt, you're a sweetie.

270
00:20:38.727 --> 00:20:41.312
Gotta get out of here before
the neighbors spot me.

271
00:20:46.402 --> 00:20:47.902
Oh, Burt.

272
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.446
This tastes a bit odd.

273
00:20:50.614 --> 00:20:51.906
Metallic.

274
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.247
- Oh. Crikey. Oh.
- What?

275
00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:02.375
I've got a pain in my chest. Ah.

276
00:21:03.085 --> 00:21:05.420
He's in the shed! Hurry!

277
00:21:09.591 --> 00:21:12.593
Mom, Dad, something happened to Burt!

278
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:21.310
Burt, what's wrong with you?

279
00:21:21.478 --> 00:21:24.313
I'll be all right, Tommy.
Don't worry about me.

280
00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:26.607
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

281
00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:49.839
What are you all staring at?

282
00:21:50.007 --> 00:21:51.758
Dirty old men need love too.

283
00:21:55.971 --> 00:21:57.847
- Mr. Munro.
- Hello.

284
00:21:58.015 --> 00:22:00.516
So, what's the story, doc?

285
00:22:00.684 --> 00:22:02.518
I'm sorry. It's not good news.

286
00:22:02.686 --> 00:22:05.104
Oh, yeah? Well, fire away.

287
00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.150
- You've had an attack of angina.
- Oh, yeah?

288
00:22:09.318 --> 00:22:11.069
You have arteriosclerosis.

289
00:22:11.904 --> 00:22:13.196
What's that?

290
00:22:13.363 --> 00:22:15.948
It's a narrowing of the arteries
from the heart.

291
00:22:16.116 --> 00:22:17.492
Oh, dear.

292
00:22:17.659 --> 00:22:19.459
I'm afraid there's
not too much we can do...

293
00:22:19.536 --> 00:22:22.056
for you at your age other than
suggesting you take it easy.

294
00:22:22.164 --> 00:22:23.331
Oh, yeah?

295
00:22:23.499 --> 00:22:26.379
Look, if you have another attack,
pop one of these under your tongue...

296
00:22:26.502 --> 00:22:29.003
let it dissolve
and then swallow the saliva.

297
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:31.339
The pain should be gone in 30 seconds.

298
00:22:31.507 --> 00:22:32.840
What do you call these things?

299
00:22:33.008 --> 00:22:34.634
- Trinitrate pills.
- Yeah?

300
00:22:34.802 --> 00:22:36.511
Better known as nitroglycerine.

301
00:22:36.678 --> 00:22:38.930
Oh, yeah. The stuff you
blow things up with.

302
00:22:39.098 --> 00:22:41.891
- Yes, but in much smaller quantities.
- Yeah. All right.

303
00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:47.105
Will this have any effect
on me riding my bike?

304
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.110
Unfortunately, I think your
motorcycling days are over.

305
00:22:52.277 --> 00:22:53.820
Like hell they are.

306
00:23:08.293 --> 00:23:10.586
It won't be much longer.

307
00:23:18.053 --> 00:23:21.389
Springfield. Springfield.

308
00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:25.226
- That's where the Indians come from.
- Indians?

309
00:23:25.394 --> 00:23:29.730
Yeah, the Indians from Springfield,
Massachusetts.

310
00:23:29.898 --> 00:23:32.567
It's the world's greatest motorcycle.

311
00:23:32.734 --> 00:23:35.194
- Oh, is that so?
- That's right.

312
00:23:36.822 --> 00:23:39.157
- You can come through now.
- All right. Thank you.

313
00:23:39.324 --> 00:23:41.659
Yeah. Springfield.

314
00:23:43.745 --> 00:23:47.206
You know, the plan is for me
to drive up to Timaru...

315
00:23:47.374 --> 00:23:51.085
and there, me and my bike will
catch a boat to the U.S. of A...

316
00:23:51.253 --> 00:23:55.590
to Los Angeles,
and the boat leaves on Saturday...

317
00:23:55.757 --> 00:23:58.467
and I'll buy a car in Los Angeles...

318
00:23:58.635 --> 00:24:01.095
and drive up to Utah
to the Bonneville Salt Flats.

319
00:24:01.263 --> 00:24:04.056
- And it's really important you do this trip?
- Sure is, mate.

320
00:24:04.224 --> 00:24:06.601
You know, ever since I was a lad...

321
00:24:06.768 --> 00:24:09.128
I've been interested in things
that go fast, you know?

322
00:24:09.229 --> 00:24:13.941
Things that roll and go, and, you know,
at Bonneville, things go real fast.

323
00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:18.654
It's, you know,
this giant, dried-up lake bed...

324
00:24:18.822 --> 00:24:21.324
and it goes for miles and miles
and it's dead flat...

325
00:24:21.491 --> 00:24:25.161
and you can drive a vehicle
just as fast as it will go...

326
00:24:25.329 --> 00:24:28.456
and it's one of the few places on Earth...

327
00:24:28.624 --> 00:24:33.044
where you can find out just
what your machine is capable of.

328
00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:35.171
In fact, here I'm on the...

329
00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:38.090
That's me on the front of
the New Zealand Motor Cyclist.

330
00:24:38.258 --> 00:24:39.926
- That's the Indian there.
- Very good.

331
00:24:40.093 --> 00:24:43.387
Yeah, a few years ago.
So I'd best be off soon...

332
00:24:43.555 --> 00:24:46.275
because I don't know how much longer
I've got to live, you see.

333
00:24:46.308 --> 00:24:48.309
Well, I don't think I heard
that last statement.

334
00:24:48.477 --> 00:24:49.810
I said, I don't know how much...

335
00:24:49.978 --> 00:24:52.772
- Yeah. I heard you the first time.
- Oh.

336
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.357
So, tell me, Burt...

337
00:24:54.524 --> 00:24:57.318
what are you offering
as collateral for this loan?

338
00:24:57.486 --> 00:24:59.987
Well, my tools and my bits 'n' pieces...

339
00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:02.155
and my trophies
and a lot of things like that.

340
00:25:02.282 --> 00:25:04.602
Well, I don't think they'd be
of much interest to the bank.

341
00:25:04.743 --> 00:25:07.245
I think we'd be looking for
something more substantial...

342
00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:10.665
something like the deed of title
to your property?

343
00:25:12.292 --> 00:25:16.254
- Did you get the money?
- Yep. Off on Thursday.

344
00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:17.505
- Thursday.
- Yeah.

345
00:25:17.673 --> 00:25:19.757
That soon? I wish I could come too.

346
00:25:19.925 --> 00:25:21.801
Maybe next time.

347
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.347
Thomas, it's dinnertime.
Come home now.

348
00:25:26.515 --> 00:25:28.140
Nearly finished, Mrs. Jackson.

349
00:25:28.308 --> 00:25:31.185
- Yeah, Mom, we're almost finished.
- Thomas.

350
00:25:32.938 --> 00:25:34.897
See you after dinner, Burt.

351
00:25:35.065 --> 00:25:36.983
All right, lad.

352
00:25:44.491 --> 00:25:46.158
Hey, not so fast!

353
00:25:46.326 --> 00:25:48.661
I'm the record-breaker.

354
00:25:50.956 --> 00:25:52.540
Where are you going?

355
00:25:54.084 --> 00:25:56.043
And that's the...

356
00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:59.714
Before I put the...
You know, the streamliner on it.

357
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.677
What's that one?

358
00:26:05.554 --> 00:26:08.139
Yeah. That's a girlfriend of mine...

359
00:26:08.307 --> 00:26:11.684
when I first bought the bike,
a long time ago, that was.

360
00:26:13.437 --> 00:26:14.437
Yeah.

361
00:26:14.604 --> 00:26:17.189
Aren't you scared
you'll kill yourself if you crash?

362
00:26:17.357 --> 00:26:18.899
No.

363
00:26:19.067 --> 00:26:25.156
No, you live more in five minutes
on a bike like this, going flat out...

364
00:26:25.324 --> 00:26:27.616
than some people live in their lifetime.

365
00:26:27.784 --> 00:26:32.496
And... Yeah, more in five minutes...

366
00:26:32.664 --> 00:26:34.248
That's my dad there.

367
00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:37.084
And my mom.

368
00:26:38.253 --> 00:26:40.254
They've all gone.

369
00:26:41.506 --> 00:26:43.966
It's gone by so fast.

370
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.386
No. Danger is the spice of life...

371
00:26:47.554 --> 00:26:50.890
and you've got to take a risk
now and again, haven't you, son?

372
00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:55.102
Yeah, that's what makes life worthwhile.

373
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.564
And, you know, having
some nice ladies around...

374
00:26:58.732 --> 00:27:00.858
can be a big help, mind you.

375
00:27:02.235 --> 00:27:06.781
- You really don't get scared?
- No. No.

376
00:27:06.948 --> 00:27:09.992
You know, when I was
a boy about your age...

377
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.121
I had a little twin brother.
His name was Ernie.

378
00:27:14.289 --> 00:27:17.541
And one day, our dad was out in the back...

379
00:27:17.709 --> 00:27:19.794
cutting down a tree...

380
00:27:19.961 --> 00:27:24.965
and suddenly it got hung up...
The tree, that is.

381
00:27:25.133 --> 00:27:28.594
It got stuck or something,
and Ernie went to try and help...

382
00:27:28.762 --> 00:27:33.808
and all of a sudden,
the tree slipped and fell on him...

383
00:27:33.975 --> 00:27:35.935
and killed him stone dead.

384
00:27:38.939 --> 00:27:40.689
Yeah.

385
00:27:40.857 --> 00:27:42.733
I'll always remember that.

386
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:44.985
Anyway, since then...

387
00:27:45.153 --> 00:27:48.155
I've always tried never
to be scared of anything.

388
00:27:48.698 --> 00:27:51.158
Though I must say,
before a big bike event...

389
00:27:51.326 --> 00:27:53.452
I do sometimes get nervous, you know.

390
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.374
If the butterflies
in my stomach were cows...

391
00:27:58.542 --> 00:28:03.003
I'd be able to start a dairy farm.

392
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:05.798
Right. That's funny.

393
00:28:06.508 --> 00:28:10.719
When they took you off in the ambulance
to the hospital, what happened?

394
00:28:10.887 --> 00:28:13.514
I don't know. It was just a touch
of indigestion, I think.

395
00:28:13.682 --> 00:28:16.016
Yeah, that's all it was.
There's nothing wrong with me.

396
00:28:16.184 --> 00:28:17.685
Don't you worry about me.

397
00:28:17.853 --> 00:28:19.353
And anyway, at my age...

398
00:28:19.521 --> 00:28:23.065
any day above ground and vertical
is a good day.

399
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.861
Listen, you take care of this
until I get back, all right?

400
00:28:27.612 --> 00:28:29.155
What happens if you don't come back?

401
00:28:29.322 --> 00:28:32.032
Well, we'll talk about that then,
shan't we?

402
00:28:34.202 --> 00:28:35.661
- Hey, Burt.
- Yeah?

403
00:28:35.829 --> 00:28:37.872
- Don't forget to mow your lawns, will you?
- What?

404
00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:41.375
Don't forget to mow your lawns.
My dad goes on and on about it.

405
00:28:41.626 --> 00:28:42.835
Oh, he does, does he?

406
00:28:43.003 --> 00:28:45.713
He says it lowers the property values
of the neighborhood.

407
00:28:47.966 --> 00:28:51.302
Well, oh, dear, we can't have that, can we?

408
00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:15.743
What are you doing?

409
00:29:15.911 --> 00:29:18.746
Hello, son! I was just getting rid
of the grass!

410
00:29:20.832 --> 00:29:23.417
Burt, what the hell
are you doing this time?

411
00:29:23.585 --> 00:29:27.463
Well, like you said, George,
I'm getting rid of the grass...

412
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:30.257
being a good neighbor
before I leave tomorrow.

413
00:29:30.425 --> 00:29:35.346
Tom. Tom! Get back inside now. Now!

414
00:29:36.515 --> 00:29:37.890
Honestly, Burt.

415
00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:44.939
- What are they doing here?
- It might be the fire, Burt.

416
00:29:53.615 --> 00:29:56.158
All right. The tire goes in first.

417
00:29:56.326 --> 00:29:58.118
That's it.

418
00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:01.121
That's it. You got it.

419
00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:02.957
Screw it in here.

420
00:30:04.543 --> 00:30:06.293
Pills.

421
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:08.587
My papers and passport.

422
00:30:08.755 --> 00:30:12.132
All right. See if I've got everything.

423
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.053
My spectacles, testicles, watch and wallet.

424
00:30:16.221 --> 00:30:17.638
What are you laughing at?

425
00:30:17.806 --> 00:30:20.849
- I'm on my way.
- Dad says to call us collect.

426
00:30:21.017 --> 00:30:23.477
- What?
- Dad says to call us collect.

427
00:30:23.645 --> 00:30:24.645
That's nice of him.

428
00:30:24.813 --> 00:30:27.356
- Tell us how you get on.
- All right. Thank you.

429
00:30:27.524 --> 00:30:29.233
That's our phone number.

430
00:30:30.569 --> 00:30:32.528
Do you think you'll break the record?

431
00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:34.863
Well, I hope so. Yeah.

432
00:30:35.031 --> 00:30:36.865
Dad doesn't think you can do it.

433
00:30:37.951 --> 00:30:39.702
Oh, is that what he said?

434
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.496
He says everyone thinks that.

435
00:30:43.373 --> 00:30:45.124
Oh, well.

436
00:30:46.084 --> 00:30:47.334
Except me.

437
00:30:52.507 --> 00:30:55.342
Ah, you're good... Good boy, Tom.

438
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.844
Yeah.

439
00:30:59.306 --> 00:31:03.684
I'll tell you something, son. If you don't
follow through on your dreams...

440
00:31:03.852 --> 00:31:05.372
you might as well be a vegetable.

441
00:31:06.938 --> 00:31:08.897
What type of vegetable?

442
00:31:09.065 --> 00:31:12.818
I don't know. A cabbage.

443
00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:14.862
Yeah. A cabbage.

444
00:31:17.616 --> 00:31:19.325
Here you are. Don't lose it, will you?

445
00:31:19.492 --> 00:31:23.245
- Promise I'll look after it.
- Right.

446
00:31:23.413 --> 00:31:26.999
So keep an eye on the place for me,
won't you, Tom?

447
00:31:27.167 --> 00:31:30.044
And...

448
00:31:30.211 --> 00:31:32.880
- don't forget to feed the fowls.
- That's my job.

449
00:31:33.048 --> 00:31:36.592
Yeah, and, you know, you can
give the eggs to Mom.

450
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.136
And what else is there?

451
00:31:39.304 --> 00:31:41.847
Uh... Oh, yes.

452
00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:45.893
You can pee on my lemon tree
for me, if you like, while I'm away.

453
00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:49.313
And... Well, there's nothing wrong
in peeing on your lemon tree.

454
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:53.275
As Confucius used to say, it's the best
natural fertilizer in the world, you know?

455
00:31:53.443 --> 00:31:54.443
Who's Confucius?

456
00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:56.403
Oh, he's a bloke who lives up in Duneaton.

457
00:31:56.571 --> 00:31:57.931
Well, thanks for your help, chaps.

458
00:31:58.073 --> 00:31:59.907
- Good luck, Burt.
- Thanks, Jeff.

459
00:32:00.075 --> 00:32:02.409
- You show them.
- I will.

460
00:32:02.577 --> 00:32:04.737
- Take it easy, Burt.
- That's not one of the things...

461
00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:06.269
I'm planning on doing, George.

462
00:32:06.373 --> 00:32:08.916
- Cheerio, love.
- Good luck.

463
00:32:09.084 --> 00:32:10.751
Cheerio, my friend.

464
00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:13.453
If you don't go when you wanna go,
when you do go, you'll find you've gone.

465
00:32:13.463 --> 00:32:14.963
- I'll see you.
- See you, Burt.

466
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:16.965
Bye, Burt.

467
00:32:17.133 --> 00:32:19.134
- Good luck!
- Cheerio!

468
00:32:19.302 --> 00:32:20.552
See you, Burt!

469
00:32:34.025 --> 00:32:35.067
Look at that.

470
00:32:45.286 --> 00:32:46.787
Well, Fran...

471
00:32:46.955 --> 00:32:49.289
I'm finally on my way.

472
00:32:51.793 --> 00:32:56.004
You know, I thought some more
of the blokes from the club...

473
00:32:56.172 --> 00:32:58.132
would have dropped by to see me off.

474
00:32:58.299 --> 00:33:00.801
Well, they probably had to work today.

475
00:33:00.969 --> 00:33:03.220
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

476
00:33:03.388 --> 00:33:07.141
You know, young Tom tells me...

477
00:33:07.308 --> 00:33:09.143
no one thinks I can do it.

478
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.270
Do you think I can do it, Fran?

479
00:33:11.438 --> 00:33:12.938
Oh, I don't know, Burt.

480
00:33:13.106 --> 00:33:15.232
I don't think it really matters
one way or the other.

481
00:33:15.775 --> 00:33:17.234
Yeah.

482
00:33:21.489 --> 00:33:25.200
You know, I read something once,
years ago...

483
00:33:25.368 --> 00:33:28.746
and I learned it off by heart. It was...

484
00:33:28.913 --> 00:33:32.708
Theodore Roosevelt said it.
He said it's...

485
00:33:32.876 --> 00:33:36.962
He said it's not the critic that counts...

486
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.216
not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles...

487
00:33:41.384 --> 00:33:46.722
or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better...

488
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.307
you know...

489
00:33:48.475 --> 00:33:53.854
the credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena.

490
00:34:01.696 --> 00:34:04.615
- Wind your window down. Down!
- What?

491
00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:08.202
- Some beer money.
- What?

492
00:34:08.369 --> 00:34:10.204
Some beer money.

493
00:34:10.371 --> 00:34:12.664
I don't drink.

494
00:34:12.832 --> 00:34:16.168
- And good luck! You go well.
- Thanks, mate.

495
00:34:16.336 --> 00:34:17.544
Show them Kiwis can fly, huh?

496
00:34:17.712 --> 00:34:19.838
Yeah. I'll bring you back
the Statue of Liberty.

497
00:34:21.382 --> 00:34:22.883
Good on you, mate. Thanks a lot.

498
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:42.903
Hey, not so fast!

499
00:34:45.406 --> 00:34:47.074
Crikey!

500
00:34:48.117 --> 00:34:50.410
Take it easy, mate!

501
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.081
I thought it was a goner.

502
00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.127
Whoa! Whoa!

503
00:35:01.256 --> 00:35:04.007
- Better get going.
- Yeah. All right.

504
00:35:04.175 --> 00:35:08.470
Take care of the old jalopy, won't you?

505
00:35:08.638 --> 00:35:10.389
- You look after yourself.
- Yeah, I will.

506
00:35:10.557 --> 00:35:13.433
- You've got your pills and everything, right?
- Yeah, right as rain.

507
00:35:13.601 --> 00:35:15.394
Okay.

508
00:35:15.562 --> 00:35:17.312
All right.

509
00:35:18.648 --> 00:35:20.232
You come back in one piece.

510
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.734
I will. Cheerio.

511
00:35:31.077 --> 00:35:34.538
- Ah. Where's the captain?
- Down below.

512
00:35:34.706 --> 00:35:36.748
- Down that gangway there.
- Thanks.

513
00:35:37.876 --> 00:35:39.501
Here.

514
00:35:39.669 --> 00:35:42.045
I'm looking for the captain.

515
00:35:42.213 --> 00:35:44.631
- That's me.
- Oh.

516
00:35:44.799 --> 00:35:47.426
Well, my name is Burt Munro.

517
00:35:49.012 --> 00:35:53.098
I'm supposed to do a job
to work my passage to Los Angeles.

518
00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:54.641
Yeah, well, I hope you can cook.

519
00:35:54.809 --> 00:35:56.310
Cook?

520
00:35:57.103 --> 00:35:59.104
Well, I'll give it a go.

521
00:35:59.272 --> 00:36:00.939
There's the galley.

522
00:36:02.358 --> 00:36:05.569
Oh. Crikey.

523
00:36:07.113 --> 00:36:08.572
Who does the dishes, mate?

524
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.657
You.

525
00:36:15.622 --> 00:36:16.997
Mm. Smells good!

526
00:36:17.165 --> 00:36:18.790
What do you have for us today, Burt?

527
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.126
That's good Kiwi tucker.

528
00:36:23.338 --> 00:36:26.173
Don't let Burt see you doing that.

529
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:29.426
Here, don't spoil it with all that sauce.

530
00:36:29.594 --> 00:36:31.470
- Sorry, Burt.
- Stand the crowds!

531
00:36:36.643 --> 00:36:38.894
- Watch the movie, Burt?
- What's that?

532
00:36:39.062 --> 00:36:40.520
Are you gonna watch the movie?

533
00:36:40.688 --> 00:36:42.522
Yeah. What's it called?

534
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.358
Broken Barrier.

535
00:36:44.525 --> 00:36:46.985
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It's supposed to be good.

536
00:36:47.153 --> 00:36:49.237
Is Jane Russell in it?

537
00:36:49.405 --> 00:36:51.907
- Space for you over here, Burt.
- Yeah.

538
00:36:52.075 --> 00:36:53.575
Whoa!

539
00:36:53.743 --> 00:36:54.868
Move your legs.

540
00:36:55.036 --> 00:36:58.997
All right. Okay.

541
00:36:59.165 --> 00:37:02.042
- Smoke?
- No. Not for me, mate.

542
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.877
- You don't smoke, Burt?
- No, I don't.

543
00:37:04.045 --> 00:37:05.545
And that's why people say to me:

544
00:37:05.713 --> 00:37:07.422
"How do you keep going
at your age, Burt?"

545
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.341
And I say,
"Well, because I don't smoke."

546
00:37:09.509 --> 00:37:12.511
And that's what I'm telling
you young monkeys. Don't smoke.

547
00:37:12.679 --> 00:37:15.389
- Ha, ha, ha.
- You can laugh, but my dad said:

548
00:37:15.556 --> 00:37:17.891
"Why contaminate your lungs
with tobacco smoke?

549
00:37:18.059 --> 00:37:19.979
The only thing you accomplish
by the smoking...

550
00:37:20.061 --> 00:37:22.301
is destroying your lungs
and shortening your life."

551
00:37:22.438 --> 00:37:23.981
Kill the lights!

552
00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:28.986
Is Jane Russell in this?

553
00:37:30.071 --> 00:37:31.238
Done well, Burt.

554
00:37:31.406 --> 00:37:33.824
Yeah. Thanks, mate.

555
00:37:33.992 --> 00:37:35.659
- All the best.
- Heh.

556
00:37:41.416 --> 00:37:43.083
- Good luck to you, Burt.
- Thanks.

557
00:37:43.251 --> 00:37:45.293
Remember what I said.
Don't smoke.

558
00:37:46.004 --> 00:37:49.256
- I'm trying.
- Cheerio, mates. See you.

559
00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:53.176
Welcome to the United States.
Customs to the left.

560
00:37:53.344 --> 00:37:54.761
Thank you. Good to be here.

561
00:37:54.929 --> 00:38:02.929
Good day.

562
00:38:03.604 --> 00:38:06.044
Please stand behind the yellow line
until you are called, sir.

563
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.567
- What's that?
- Behind the yellow line.

564
00:38:08.735 --> 00:38:11.278
The yellow line. Oh, yeah.

565
00:38:20.038 --> 00:38:21.079
Good day.

566
00:38:21.247 --> 00:38:22.914
Passport and customs declaration, please.

567
00:38:23.082 --> 00:38:25.751
Right. Here you are.

568
00:38:31.758 --> 00:38:33.958
And how long do you intend
to stay in the United States?

569
00:38:34.093 --> 00:38:38.221
However long it takes me
to get to Bonneville and back.

570
00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:39.598
And the purpose of your visit?

571
00:38:39.766 --> 00:38:43.977
To set a land-speed record on my Indian.

572
00:38:44.145 --> 00:38:45.812
Hm. Indian.

573
00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.857
Mr. Munro,
this is your first time to America.

574
00:38:49.025 --> 00:38:50.442
Yes, sir.

575
00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.650
You gave some rather odd answers
to the officer...

576
00:38:52.695 --> 00:38:54.935
so we have a few further questions
we'd like to ask.

577
00:38:54.989 --> 00:38:56.239
Well, fire away.

578
00:38:56.407 --> 00:38:58.658
Let's go over again what you said.

579
00:38:58.826 --> 00:39:01.369
Now, what exactly do you intend to do
here in the United States?

580
00:39:01.537 --> 00:39:03.580
Well, set a land-speed record.

581
00:39:03.748 --> 00:39:06.500
Uh-huh. And how do you
intend to do that, sir?

582
00:39:06.667 --> 00:39:10.420
On my motorcycle. It's in the hold
of the ship at the moment...

583
00:39:10.588 --> 00:39:13.131
and they're gonna unload it tomorrow.

584
00:39:13.299 --> 00:39:16.510
It's an Indian, a 1920 Indian Scout...

585
00:39:16.677 --> 00:39:19.471
modified somewhat.

586
00:39:19.639 --> 00:39:22.557
You know what?
I think I've read about your bike.

587
00:39:22.725 --> 00:39:23.767
Oh, yeah?

588
00:39:23.935 --> 00:39:26.603
It was in Popular Mechanics
a couple of years ago.

589
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:28.021
That's right. That's me.

590
00:39:28.189 --> 00:39:32.192
Yes. Leslie Hobbs from Christchurch
sent that story.

591
00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.237
What was it?
"Fastest motorcycle in Australia."

592
00:39:35.404 --> 00:39:37.739
Yeah, and in New Zealand.

593
00:39:39.408 --> 00:39:41.451
Well, I guess you're legitimate,
Mr. Munro.

594
00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:44.371
It sounds like we should be very honored
to have you here in America.

595
00:39:44.539 --> 00:39:46.331
- Thank you.
- Here's what I'm gonna do.

596
00:39:46.499 --> 00:39:50.252
I'm gonna give you 6 months. That should
be time enough to get the job done.

597
00:39:51.712 --> 00:39:54.089
- Welcome to the U.S.A.
- Thank you very much.

598
00:39:54.257 --> 00:39:57.384
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

599
00:40:02.974 --> 00:40:04.349
Gear's in the trunk.

600
00:40:04.517 --> 00:40:06.101
- What?
- Bags in the back.

601
00:40:06.269 --> 00:40:08.228
Bag, back.

602
00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:11.231
Don't worry about me.
I'll do it myself.

603
00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:12.941
It's good.

604
00:40:25.371 --> 00:40:28.707
- All right.
- Sit in the back. In the back.

605
00:40:28.875 --> 00:40:30.584
- Huh?
- You, in the back.

606
00:40:30.751 --> 00:40:34.045
Oh. I'll tell you something, mate.

607
00:40:34.213 --> 00:40:37.257
I don't want to get old around here.
Ha, ha.

608
00:40:37.425 --> 00:40:39.885
Ah. Toorah.

609
00:40:43.222 --> 00:40:44.431
- Where to?
- What?

610
00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:45.849
Where to?

611
00:40:46.017 --> 00:40:48.518
Hollywood. I want to go to Hollywood.

612
00:40:48.686 --> 00:40:50.937
I want to see the film stars.

613
00:40:51.105 --> 00:40:53.440
Okay. We go to Hollywood.

614
00:40:53.608 --> 00:40:55.650
Where in Hollywood?

615
00:40:55.985 --> 00:40:59.654
A motel on Sunset Boulevard.

616
00:40:59.822 --> 00:41:01.698
I hear that's a pretty great street.

617
00:41:01.866 --> 00:41:03.950
I don't know who you talking to lately.

618
00:41:04.118 --> 00:41:07.037
- Which motel?
- Recommend one.

619
00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:10.123
Come, now. What do you think I am,
an encyclopedia?

620
00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:14.544
Drop me somewhere
and I'll sort it out myself.

621
00:41:22.428 --> 00:41:25.096
They must have a big electricity bill here.

622
00:41:29.435 --> 00:41:32.896
Firestone, Shell...

623
00:41:34.482 --> 00:41:38.485
It's all about cars, isn't it?
I've never seen so many cars.

624
00:41:38.653 --> 00:41:42.322
- You say something, man?
- I said, I've never seen so many cars.

625
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.117
- Gotta get around somehow.
- Yeah.

626
00:41:49.956 --> 00:41:51.998
Oh, look. There's a bowling alley.

627
00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:53.667
Do you bowl?

628
00:41:59.465 --> 00:42:01.633
What's he honking his horn about?

629
00:42:04.929 --> 00:42:07.514
Jeez! Crikey! Did you see that?

630
00:42:07.682 --> 00:42:10.892
Don't think... He's just got...

631
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.144
He's crazy! He's nuts!

632
00:42:13.312 --> 00:42:15.146
He did it again.

633
00:42:15.314 --> 00:42:18.400
Don't stare. There's a lot
of crazy people in this town.

634
00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:20.777
I've never seen anything like that before.

635
00:42:31.872 --> 00:42:33.873
- This should do.
- What's the damage?

636
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:37.377
Twenty-eight dollars plus bag, $29.

637
00:42:37.545 --> 00:42:42.382
What? Did you just say
what I thought you said?

638
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.591
Are you deaf?

639
00:42:43.759 --> 00:42:45.719
- What?
- Are you deaf?

640
00:42:45.886 --> 00:42:49.723
Yeah, I am a bit deaf, but I'm not stupid.
How much did you say it was?

641
00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.224
Twenty-nine dollar.

642
00:42:51.392 --> 00:42:53.101
No. I don't want to
buy the cab, mate.

643
00:42:53.269 --> 00:42:55.854
I just want to pay the fare, that's all.

644
00:42:56.022 --> 00:42:57.355
- Where are you from?
- What?

645
00:42:57.523 --> 00:42:59.899
- You are British?
- No. You must be joking.

646
00:43:00.067 --> 00:43:03.570
I'm no pommie. I'm from New Zealand.

647
00:43:03.738 --> 00:43:05.780
- Well, this is America.
- Yeah?

648
00:43:05.948 --> 00:43:08.700
And the fare is right there
on the meter. Twenty-nine dollar.

649
00:43:08.868 --> 00:43:11.911
- Yeah.
- Open your wallet and let the moths out.

650
00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:16.041
Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Here you go, $29.

651
00:43:16.709 --> 00:43:17.917
Hold on. Don't forget the tip.

652
00:43:18.085 --> 00:43:20.712
- What?
- Yes. We tip in America.

653
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.172
- Oh, yeah?
- Ten percent.

654
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.424
- How much?
- Ten percent.

655
00:43:24.592 --> 00:43:27.844
Oh, yeah. There you are. Ten cents.

656
00:43:36.103 --> 00:43:37.979
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?

657
00:43:38.147 --> 00:43:39.939
- You look like a generous man.
- What?

658
00:43:40.107 --> 00:43:41.358
You look like a generous man.

659
00:43:41.525 --> 00:43:43.443
- Oh, do I?
- Yes, you do.

660
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:45.945
Would you like to buy a flower
to give to someone special?

661
00:43:46.113 --> 00:43:47.572
No, I'm sorry.
I don't have any cash.

662
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.825
Oh, don't worry.
The money goes to a good cause.

663
00:43:50.993 --> 00:43:52.913
It's for an organization
that helps needy people.

664
00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:56.956
- All right. Well, how much is it?
- Just give what you can afford.

665
00:43:57.124 --> 00:44:01.169
All right. Well, they all look
the same to me.

666
00:44:01.337 --> 00:44:03.963
- They're all green.
- Yes, that's why we call them greenbacks.

667
00:44:04.131 --> 00:44:06.051
- This looks like a one.
- Oh, look, there's one.

668
00:44:06.133 --> 00:44:07.926
Thanks. You have a good day.

669
00:44:08.094 --> 00:44:10.470
Hey, come on, miss.
That's a 10.

670
00:44:10.638 --> 00:44:12.263
I didn't want to pay that much.

671
00:44:12.431 --> 00:44:13.973
Hey, come back!

672
00:44:17.103 --> 00:44:18.311
Crikey.

673
00:44:18.479 --> 00:44:20.313
- Hey, baby.
- What do you want?

674
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:22.315
- You want to go?
- Go where?

675
00:44:22.483 --> 00:44:23.858
Go inside.

676
00:44:24.026 --> 00:44:25.568
I'm going inside.

677
00:44:25.736 --> 00:44:27.529
I'll take you around the world.

678
00:44:27.696 --> 00:44:29.823
I've just come from halfway
around the world.

679
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.908
- Fifteen bucks, baby.
- What?

680
00:44:32.076 --> 00:44:36.287
- Fifteen bucks.
- No. It's all right. Go away.

681
00:44:41.752 --> 00:44:43.753
Hello.

682
00:44:46.882 --> 00:44:49.134
Phew. Well, I need a room.

683
00:44:49.301 --> 00:44:51.344
A room will cost you 5 bucks an hour.

684
00:44:51.512 --> 00:44:54.013
Well, I'm planning on staying
a bit longer than that.

685
00:44:54.181 --> 00:44:56.391
- How long?
- I don't know. A couple of days, I guess.

686
00:44:56.559 --> 00:44:58.726
- Double occupancy?
- What?

687
00:44:58.894 --> 00:45:00.353
Double occupancy?

688
00:45:00.521 --> 00:45:03.231
No. Just me, myself and I.

689
00:45:03.399 --> 00:45:07.152
Will it cost a lot?
Because I can't afford a lot.

690
00:45:07.945 --> 00:45:10.363
- Are you a member of AAA?
- What?

691
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:12.782
- Are you a AAA member?
- Never heard of them.

692
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.033
Never heard of AAA?

693
00:45:14.201 --> 00:45:19.205
No, Miss Brittlebritches,
I have not heard of AAA.

694
00:45:19.373 --> 00:45:21.207
Okay, let's just say
you are a member, doll.

695
00:45:21.375 --> 00:45:23.668
- All right.
- That'll save you 10 percent.

696
00:45:23.836 --> 00:45:26.546
- Oh.
- How does 22 bucks a night sound?

697
00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:29.424
That much? Is that cheap?

698
00:45:29.592 --> 00:45:31.926
Honey, that's cheaper than cheap.

699
00:45:32.094 --> 00:45:34.554
Oh, good. Yeah.

700
00:45:34.722 --> 00:45:37.557
- What's your name?
- Tina Washington.

701
00:45:37.725 --> 00:45:40.393
Well, Tina Washington,
I want you to have this.

702
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:44.230
It might cheer you up a bit,
get some of that muck off your pluck.

703
00:45:44.398 --> 00:45:49.027
Well, thank you. That's the first nice thing
that's happened around here all week.

704
00:45:49.195 --> 00:45:50.528
Well, you're welcome.

705
00:45:50.696 --> 00:45:54.782
My name's Burt Munro, from New Zealand.
I'm from down under.

706
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.911
Well, hello, Burt Munro
from New Zealand down under.

707
00:45:58.078 --> 00:46:00.288
I tell you, I've had a heck of a night.

708
00:46:00.456 --> 00:46:02.707
Welcome to Hollyweird.

709
00:46:54.009 --> 00:46:55.802
Hello.

710
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:57.470
Anybody home?

711
00:46:59.473 --> 00:47:01.516
- Hello, Tina.
- Good morning, Burt.

712
00:47:01.684 --> 00:47:04.394
- You still here? Oh.
- Mm-hm.

713
00:47:04.562 --> 00:47:07.146
Well, that's why you were
so crabby last night.

714
00:47:07.314 --> 00:47:10.608
- Don't you ever get any sleep?
- Honey, I work the night shift.

715
00:47:10.776 --> 00:47:13.486
I'm out of here as soon
as James turns up. And he's late.

716
00:47:13.654 --> 00:47:17.198
Oh. Yeah. Could you phone
this number for me?

717
00:47:17.866 --> 00:47:20.785
It's a shipping company
and they've got a big box of mine...

718
00:47:20.953 --> 00:47:25.456
and I want to know how
can I arrange to get it?

719
00:47:26.834 --> 00:47:28.794
No, you talk to them.
They'll never get my accent.

720
00:47:28.919 --> 00:47:30.503
Okay. What do you
want me to ask them?

721
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:32.130
One moment, please.

722
00:47:32.298 --> 00:47:36.593
Ask them when will Burt Munro's box
containing the motorcycle...

723
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.469
be ready for pickup?

724
00:47:38.637 --> 00:47:41.306
- Hello. I'm calling for Mr. Burt Munro.
- Munro?

725
00:47:41.473 --> 00:47:44.073
Yes. He'd like to know when
the box containing his motorcycle...

726
00:47:44.143 --> 00:47:46.686
- will be available for pickup.
- What ship?

727
00:47:46.854 --> 00:47:49.439
- What ship?
- The Rangatira from New Zealand.

728
00:47:49.607 --> 00:47:51.524
The Rangatira from New Zealand.

729
00:47:51.692 --> 00:47:53.651
- It's arrived.
- So he can claim it?

730
00:47:53.819 --> 00:47:58.031
Tomorrow from the Long Beach
Customs Holding Area.

731
00:47:58.198 --> 00:48:01.576
- Okay, thank you. I'll tell him. Bye-bye.
- That was pretty fast.

732
00:48:01.744 --> 00:48:03.703
You're late!

733
00:48:05.664 --> 00:48:08.041
I can't stand another minute in this place.

734
00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:09.834
Let me buy you breakfast.

735
00:48:12.546 --> 00:48:14.213
This is great.

736
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:18.551
I've never seen a menu
with photographs before.

737
00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:20.219
Ready to order, sir?

738
00:48:20.387 --> 00:48:22.221
- What?
- Are you ready?

739
00:48:22.389 --> 00:48:27.393
Oh, yes. I think the Double Delight.

740
00:48:27.561 --> 00:48:28.561
That's for me.

741
00:48:28.729 --> 00:48:30.730
- How would you like your eggs?
- What?

742
00:48:30.898 --> 00:48:34.776
- How would you like your eggs?
- Well, I'd like them cooked.

743
00:48:34.943 --> 00:48:38.571
Sunny-side up? Over easy?

744
00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:40.448
I don't know.
Whatever you recommend.

745
00:48:40.616 --> 00:48:42.033
Over easy is best.

746
00:48:42.201 --> 00:48:44.035
All right. Eggs over easy.

747
00:48:44.203 --> 00:48:45.244
Make that two.

748
00:48:46.038 --> 00:48:48.456
Over easy. I must remember that.

749
00:48:48.624 --> 00:48:51.959
Well, I like this American breakfast thing.

750
00:48:52.127 --> 00:48:54.754
It's good.

751
00:48:54.922 --> 00:48:59.217
So, my girl, where's the best place
for me to get a used car?

752
00:48:59.385 --> 00:49:01.427
- The valley.
- Oh, yeah?

753
00:49:01.595 --> 00:49:03.195
After breakfast, I could take you there.

754
00:49:03.305 --> 00:49:04.847
Oh, well, thank you.

755
00:49:06.058 --> 00:49:07.517
And I'm not a girl.

756
00:49:10.396 --> 00:49:12.605
I'm a boy.

757
00:49:12.773 --> 00:49:14.440
Oh.

758
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.444
Well, I thought there was something
a little odd about you.

759
00:49:18.612 --> 00:49:22.031
But you're still a sweetheart.

760
00:49:24.702 --> 00:49:26.119
Yeah.

761
00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:41.426
Well, thanks a million, Tina.

762
00:49:41.593 --> 00:49:43.803
There are stacks of cars here.

763
00:49:43.971 --> 00:49:47.181
- I'll be back at the motel later on.
- Bye.

764
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:48.850
All right, love.

765
00:49:53.939 --> 00:49:55.982
- Hello.
- How may I help you, sir?

766
00:49:56.150 --> 00:50:00.403
Yeah. I want to buy a car. A cheap car.
A very cheap car.

767
00:50:00.571 --> 00:50:02.655
Well, you've come to
the right place, amigo.

768
00:50:02.823 --> 00:50:07.243
In fact, if you can find cars like these
any cheaper, they're probably stolen.

769
00:50:07.411 --> 00:50:10.204
My name is Burt.
Burt Munro from New Zealand.

770
00:50:10.372 --> 00:50:12.457
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Fernando from El Salvador.

771
00:50:12.624 --> 00:50:14.959
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Munro.
- You can call me Burt.

772
00:50:15.127 --> 00:50:17.336
- Okay, Mr. Burt.
- Yeah.

773
00:50:17.504 --> 00:50:20.131
So how much were you looking
to spend here, Mr. Burt?

774
00:50:20.299 --> 00:50:21.591
Not a lot, Fernando.

775
00:50:21.759 --> 00:50:24.510
I haven't got much left after
the cab ride I took yesterday.

776
00:50:25.846 --> 00:50:27.764
You want 399 for this?

777
00:50:27.931 --> 00:50:30.224
Sounds a bit sick.

778
00:50:30.392 --> 00:50:31.934
Well, what would you offer me?

779
00:50:32.102 --> 00:50:36.022
Listen, I'll give you 200
if you do me a favor.

780
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.524
Throw in the use of your workshop...

781
00:50:38.692 --> 00:50:41.861
and some of that junk I see lying around...

782
00:50:42.029 --> 00:50:47.116
because I've got to knock up a trailer
to drag my bike over to Bonneville.

783
00:50:47.284 --> 00:50:49.535
That's not a favor.
Three twenty-five is a favor.

784
00:50:49.703 --> 00:50:52.497
No, 225.

785
00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:56.375
You're a tough customer, Mr. Burt,
but I like you.

786
00:50:56.543 --> 00:50:58.169
I'm gonna give it to you for 250...

787
00:50:58.337 --> 00:51:00.880
and you can use the workshop,
but only at night.

788
00:51:01.048 --> 00:51:02.548
All right. What about tonight?

789
00:51:02.716 --> 00:51:04.217
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, tonight's okay.

790
00:51:04.384 --> 00:51:06.344
All right. Let's stop the car.

791
00:51:06.512 --> 00:51:08.846
Let's get this thing running properly.

792
00:51:22.402 --> 00:51:25.404
There. That sounds better.

793
00:51:25.572 --> 00:51:26.572
Let me drive.

794
00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.491
Okay. Come on.

795
00:51:28.659 --> 00:51:31.869
Yeah, she's singing like a bird now.

796
00:51:32.037 --> 00:51:33.746
She's a good old girl, isn't she?

797
00:51:33.914 --> 00:51:35.456
Here we are. All right.

798
00:51:42.089 --> 00:51:44.257
You make a left here, Mr. Burt.

799
00:51:44.424 --> 00:51:45.925
All right.

800
00:51:49.763 --> 00:51:52.765
- Crikey!
- You're on the wrong... Stop the car!

801
00:51:52.933 --> 00:51:55.476
Stop the... Aah!

802
00:51:55.644 --> 00:51:57.436
Turn! Turn this way!

803
00:51:58.522 --> 00:52:00.106
Stop the car!

804
00:52:02.276 --> 00:52:04.443
Hey, keep your shirt on.

805
00:52:05.863 --> 00:52:07.613
Scoot over, you stupid old bastard.

806
00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:09.282
Thought I was back in New Zealand.

807
00:52:09.449 --> 00:52:11.784
We drive on the other side
of the road over there.

808
00:52:11.952 --> 00:52:15.788
- Yeah? Gonna get us all killed.
- Yeah.

809
00:52:15.956 --> 00:52:17.832
Well, you're not in New Zealand.

810
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.876
- You're in America.
- Yeah, I know.

811
00:52:20.043 --> 00:52:22.795
- We drive on the right side of the road.
- Yeah.

812
00:52:30.095 --> 00:52:33.306
- Whoa.
- Now, Burt, let me give you some advice.

813
00:52:33.473 --> 00:52:35.016
What?

814
00:52:36.476 --> 00:52:38.811
When you're driving,
not only here in America...

815
00:52:38.979 --> 00:52:41.397
- but anywheres around the world...
- Yeah?

816
00:52:41.565 --> 00:52:44.150
the driver should always be
in the center of the road.

817
00:52:44.318 --> 00:52:46.819
- Right.
- In the center. If you're not in the center...

818
00:52:46.987 --> 00:52:49.530
you're on the wrong side
of the road. Okay?

819
00:52:49.698 --> 00:52:50.740
Yep.

820
00:52:58.749 --> 00:53:01.125
Well, you want this right here?

821
00:53:01.293 --> 00:53:03.044
Yeah.

822
00:53:05.255 --> 00:53:08.049
That's it. Yeah, good.

823
00:53:08.216 --> 00:53:09.759
Got it.

824
00:53:09.927 --> 00:53:11.802
Dios mio, it's 3 a. m. in the morning.

825
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:14.388
Yeah, well, time flies when
you're having fun, doesn't it?

826
00:53:16.016 --> 00:53:18.643
You know, when I told you you could
use the workshop at night...

827
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:21.604
I didn't mean all night.
My wife's gonna kill me.

828
00:53:21.772 --> 00:53:23.064
You take yourself back home...

829
00:53:23.231 --> 00:53:25.390
and I'll have a snooze
in the back of the car...

830
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.195
and I'll lock up the place
before I go to sleep.

831
00:53:29.363 --> 00:53:33.032
Seems to me like a whole lot of effort
to sell a lousy $250 motorcar.

832
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.450
- Yeah.
- Okay, Mr. Burt.

833
00:53:34.618 --> 00:53:36.494
Pull the door down.
Have a good night.

834
00:53:37.412 --> 00:53:40.581
Hey, Fernando, where do I go to...?

835
00:53:40.749 --> 00:53:42.708
Where do I take a leak around here?

836
00:53:42.876 --> 00:53:43.960
A leak?

837
00:53:44.127 --> 00:53:47.088
Yeah. A pee. Trouble with
the old prostate, you know.

838
00:53:47.255 --> 00:53:50.883
Yeah. Go straight through those doors.
There's a door there that says "cabaliero."

839
00:53:51.051 --> 00:53:52.426
- All right.
- Okay.

840
00:53:52.594 --> 00:53:55.054
I'll see you in the morning, early, okay?

841
00:53:55.222 --> 00:53:56.847
Good night.

842
00:53:57.015 --> 00:53:58.057
Now, where were we?

843
00:54:02.145 --> 00:54:04.855
- Burt?
- Huh?

844
00:54:05.023 --> 00:54:08.401
- Buenos dias, Mr. Burt.
- Oh. All right.

845
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.237
So did you get it all finished?

846
00:54:11.405 --> 00:54:15.074
Yeah. All I need to do is find
a couple of wheels...

847
00:54:15.242 --> 00:54:16.784
and I'll be ready to roll.

848
00:54:16.952 --> 00:54:19.472
Hey, you know, I got some wheels
in the back you could have...

849
00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:22.164
- if you just do me a favor.
- Say the word.

850
00:54:25.585 --> 00:54:26.961
Crank it now, Fernando.

851
00:54:28.296 --> 00:54:30.297
Good.

852
00:54:30.465 --> 00:54:32.174
- Burt.
- Yeah?

853
00:54:32.342 --> 00:54:33.634
You're a goddamn genius.

854
00:54:33.802 --> 00:54:36.929
- Thank you.
- Hey, listen, why you gotta go?

855
00:54:37.097 --> 00:54:38.764
Stick around a while. I'll pay you well.

856
00:54:38.932 --> 00:54:41.392
Sorry, mate. I've got to get
to Bonneville by the 23rd.

857
00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.937
That's when Speed Week starts,
and, you know, I've gotta hit the road.

858
00:54:45.105 --> 00:54:46.981
Well, you always got a job here.

859
00:54:47.149 --> 00:54:48.983
Thanks, mate. I'll see you.

860
00:54:49.151 --> 00:54:51.736
- Best of luck to you.
- Ta-ta.

861
00:55:05.125 --> 00:55:06.250
Hello, love.

862
00:55:06.418 --> 00:55:08.794
- I was worried about you.
- Oh, yeah?

863
00:55:08.962 --> 00:55:11.255
Housekeeping said you didn't
sleep in your bed all night.

864
00:55:11.423 --> 00:55:13.591
Oh. Well, do I get a discount for that?

865
00:55:14.134 --> 00:55:15.134
I doubt it.

866
00:55:15.302 --> 00:55:17.928
Now, I need you to show me on a map
how to get to Long Beach.

867
00:55:18.096 --> 00:55:21.098
- I've got to pick up my bike today.
- I'm finished here in 15 minutes.

868
00:55:21.266 --> 00:55:22.308
I'll come with you.

869
00:55:25.353 --> 00:55:28.689
Not a bad set of wheels for 250 bucks, eh?

870
00:55:28.857 --> 00:55:30.274
You sure it'll make it to Utah?

871
00:55:30.442 --> 00:55:34.528
Yeah. This old girl'd get
to New Zealand and back.

872
00:55:34.696 --> 00:55:36.030
Here.

873
00:55:36.198 --> 00:55:38.282
- Hop in, my fair lady.
- Thank you.

874
00:55:40.577 --> 00:55:43.120
The bloke who sold me this car,
he gave me a good tip.

875
00:55:43.288 --> 00:55:46.499
He said, always remember that
the driver... That's me.

876
00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:50.252
- should be on the center of the road.
- Look out!

877
00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.672
Yeah, all right. In New Zealand,
we always drive on the other side.

878
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:58.219
- You do?
- Yeah. Sorry about that.

879
00:55:59.763 --> 00:56:01.643
- Do you want me to drive?
- No. It's all right.

880
00:56:01.807 --> 00:56:03.724
I've got to get used to it, don't I?

881
00:56:06.019 --> 00:56:08.062
This should be Customs right here.

882
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:09.522
Right.

883
00:56:15.946 --> 00:56:17.696
- Hello.
- May I help you, sir?

884
00:56:17.864 --> 00:56:19.573
Yeah. My name's Burt Munro...

885
00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:21.992
and I've come to pick up my motorcycle.

886
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.203
I came into port two days ago
from New Zealand...

887
00:56:24.371 --> 00:56:27.832
and, uh...
On a freighter called Rangatira...

888
00:56:27.999 --> 00:56:30.399
and I was told to come here
to clear it through Customs.

889
00:56:30.502 --> 00:56:32.253
Okay. Mr. Munro.

890
00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.047
Yeah. Munro. M-U-N-R-O.

891
00:56:35.215 --> 00:56:39.635
Munro. Wait here a minute, sir.

892
00:56:39.803 --> 00:56:41.387
Thank you.

893
00:56:43.807 --> 00:56:45.766
Mr. Munro is here
for that damaged shipment.

894
00:56:45.934 --> 00:56:47.977
- You want me to talk to him?
- Yeah.

895
00:56:49.855 --> 00:56:51.981
- Mr. "Moonro."
- Munro.

896
00:56:52.149 --> 00:56:54.483
- Come with me to the storage area.
- Is there a problem?

897
00:56:54.651 --> 00:56:56.777
Your consignment has suffered some damage.

898
00:56:56.945 --> 00:56:59.071
Oh, no.

899
00:56:59.239 --> 00:57:03.284
Why the heck did I bother to paint
these arrows on the side of it then?

900
00:57:03.451 --> 00:57:05.578
That's the way it was delivered here,
unfortunately.

901
00:57:05.745 --> 00:57:07.079
Well, what happened to it?

902
00:57:07.247 --> 00:57:09.331
My information is that
10 tons of fertilizer...

903
00:57:09.499 --> 00:57:12.585
was inadvertently loaded on top
of your box while it was in the hold.

904
00:57:12.752 --> 00:57:13.961
I'd sue the shipping company.

905
00:57:14.129 --> 00:57:16.797
Sue? I have no time to waste
my blooming life suing anybody.

906
00:57:16.965 --> 00:57:20.384
Get some of your blokes
to pull this right-side up...

907
00:57:20.552 --> 00:57:24.763
so I can get in to the motorcycle
and see what damage has been done.

908
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:28.642
All right, fellas.
Let's get it unwrapped.

909
00:57:31.438 --> 00:57:33.397
Well, the tire's all right.

910
00:57:38.278 --> 00:57:40.279
No damage so far.

911
00:57:41.615 --> 00:57:44.408
No damage at all. It's good.

912
00:57:44.576 --> 00:57:47.328
- Lucky it was packed so well.
- Yeah. It's a blooming miracle.

913
00:57:49.956 --> 00:57:54.168
Well, the old Indian lives
to fight another day!

914
00:58:00.634 --> 00:58:02.384
Well, thanks a million, Tina.

915
00:58:02.552 --> 00:58:04.512
I don't know what I'd have done
without you today.

916
00:58:04.638 --> 00:58:06.472
You're the real salt of the earth,
you know?

917
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.560
Are you sure you wouldn't like to come
home to mi casa for dinner tonight?

918
00:58:09.684 --> 00:58:11.524
- No, I can't, love.
- I could cook you a meal.

919
00:58:11.603 --> 00:58:14.243
I've gotta get the show on the road,
get out of Dodge, as they say.

920
00:58:14.397 --> 00:58:16.607
Okay, my good friend from kiwi-land.

921
00:58:17.108 --> 00:58:18.817
- You stay in touch, won't you?
- I will.

922
00:58:19.653 --> 00:58:21.237
- Here's my phone number.
- Okay.

923
00:58:21.404 --> 00:58:24.156
- Call me and tell me how you're doing.
- I will. Can I call collect?

924
00:58:24.824 --> 00:58:26.283
You can try.

925
00:58:32.582 --> 00:58:35.501
- It's a good job I think you're a woman.
- I am a woman.

926
00:58:35.669 --> 00:58:38.504
Yeah, right. Ta-ta, love. See you.

927
00:59:05.865 --> 00:59:07.658
- Morning.
- Good morning.

928
00:59:09.369 --> 00:59:11.036
Fill her up, would you, please?

929
00:59:11.204 --> 00:59:13.038
Regular or ethyl?

930
00:59:13.206 --> 00:59:14.873
Who's Ethel?

931
00:59:15.959 --> 00:59:19.128
All right. I'll take ethyl.

932
00:59:25.677 --> 00:59:29.221
- Hi, young fella.
- Hello. Is this a rocket ship?

933
00:59:29.389 --> 00:59:31.890
- What?
- Is this a rocket ship?

934
00:59:32.058 --> 00:59:34.226
I hope so.

935
01:00:13.308 --> 01:00:14.558
Oh, gosh.

936
01:00:21.107 --> 01:00:23.108
What's happened to you?

937
01:00:27.447 --> 01:00:29.365
Oh, well.

938
01:00:32.285 --> 01:00:34.119
Let's have a look at you.

939
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:51.804
Gotcha!

940
01:00:54.015 --> 01:00:55.766
Hey, come on.

941
01:01:06.986 --> 01:01:09.863
I thought we were gonna
make it, you and me...

942
01:01:10.031 --> 01:01:12.991
and now look what's happened.

943
01:01:13.159 --> 01:01:14.701
Ah.

944
01:02:04.627 --> 01:02:06.795
- Hello, mate.
- Got a problem?

945
01:02:06.963 --> 01:02:10.966
Yeah. Am I glad to see you.
Yeah, I've lost a wheel.

946
01:02:11.134 --> 01:02:12.934
Help me get my rig back
on the road, will you?

947
01:02:13.052 --> 01:02:15.220
Okay, let me see.

948
01:02:15.388 --> 01:02:18.307
My name's Burt. Burt Munro.

949
01:02:18.475 --> 01:02:20.601
- Jake.
- Jake? Are you Indian?

950
01:02:20.768 --> 01:02:22.227
- Yes.
- Yeah.

951
01:02:22.395 --> 01:02:24.730
Well, this here could be
the world's fastest Indian.

952
01:02:24.898 --> 01:02:26.940
Well, at least until just now.

953
01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:28.942
She's a bit heavy, mind you.

954
01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:31.278
Let's take it easy. One, two, three.

955
01:02:33.573 --> 01:02:35.073
You live around here, Jake?

956
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.341
- Burt.
- Huh?

957
01:02:52.509 --> 01:02:55.469
What do you want to ride
that contraption for?

958
01:02:55.637 --> 01:02:59.223
That's a good question. Uh...

959
01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:02.893
I guess the reward is in
the doing of it, you know?

960
01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:04.895
I don't want to go to bed.

961
01:03:05.063 --> 01:03:07.773
Jake, I'm dying for a pee.
Where do I go?

962
01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:09.983
There's a little building back there.

963
01:03:10.151 --> 01:03:13.111
I got a touch of prostate trouble,
you know?

964
01:03:13.279 --> 01:03:14.947
I have similar problems.

965
01:03:15.114 --> 01:03:19.243
Well, I thought you blokes would have
some magic cure for that sort of thing.

966
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:21.537
- Well, we have.
- Oh, yeah?

967
01:03:21.704 --> 01:03:23.789
One old remedy is ground-up dog balls.

968
01:03:23.957 --> 01:03:26.708
- Oh, good.
- Then you're happy for prostate trouble.

969
01:03:26.876 --> 01:03:28.794
Yeah, I bet you do, mate.

970
01:03:31.881 --> 01:03:33.590
Got you!

971
01:03:34.884 --> 01:03:37.928
Jake, gotta get going.
Gotta hit the road.

972
01:03:38.096 --> 01:03:40.973
- Burt, I have something for you.
- What's that, then?

973
01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:44.977
- What's this?
- For good luck.

974
01:03:45.144 --> 01:03:48.981
Oh, yeah, a piece of...
I've never worn jewelry before.

975
01:03:49.148 --> 01:03:51.984
Thanks, mate.
Oh, I've got something for you too.

976
01:03:53.987 --> 01:03:56.989
Right. Let's see.

977
01:03:58.992 --> 01:04:02.035
Here. I've got this.

978
01:04:02.203 --> 01:04:04.204
It's a spare one. I made it myself.

979
01:04:04.372 --> 01:04:05.497
What do I do with this?

980
01:04:05.665 --> 01:04:07.833
- You got a hacksaw?
- Yeah.

981
01:04:08.001 --> 01:04:11.169
You just slice the top of it through there.
It could also make a great ashtray.

982
01:04:11.337 --> 01:04:13.005
Not that I approve of smoking, mind you.

983
01:04:13.172 --> 01:04:15.299
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot, mate. So long.

984
01:04:15.466 --> 01:04:16.866
Sorry we couldn't fix your trailer.

985
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:18.610
That's all right.
I'll get there somehow.

986
01:04:18.761 --> 01:04:21.805
- Burt.
- What?

987
01:04:21.973 --> 01:04:23.890
- For the prostate.
- Aha.

988
01:04:24.058 --> 01:04:25.517
Use it with water. Plenty of water.

989
01:04:25.685 --> 01:04:28.020
Tastes bad. Really bad.

990
01:04:28.187 --> 01:04:30.355
Dogs' balls, huh?

991
01:04:30.523 --> 01:04:33.525
Well, thanks a lot, mate.
See you! Ta-ta!

992
01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:35.545
Hello?

993
01:05:39.258 --> 01:05:40.425
Anyone home?

994
01:05:48.768 --> 01:05:51.645
Hello! Hello there!

995
01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:55.440
I've a spot of bother with my trailer.

996
01:05:55.608 --> 01:05:57.651
I've lost a wheel.

997
01:05:59.237 --> 01:06:00.637
You're not from around these parts.

998
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.197
No, I'm from down there.

999
01:06:02.365 --> 01:06:03.532
What?

1000
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.285
I'm from down under.
The other side of the world. New Zealand.

1001
01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:11.206
Southernmost city in the British Empire,
called Invercargill...

1002
01:06:11.374 --> 01:06:13.374
one of the most beautiful cities
on the Earth.

1003
01:06:13.459 --> 01:06:15.669
My name's Burt Munro.

1004
01:06:15.837 --> 01:06:17.379
Burt? Ada.

1005
01:06:17.547 --> 01:06:19.464
- What?
- Ada!

1006
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:23.468
- Here she is.
- Whoa!

1007
01:06:23.636 --> 01:06:26.805
Huh! Ohh.

1008
01:06:28.099 --> 01:06:30.559
Well, you got some problems here, yessiree.

1009
01:06:30.727 --> 01:06:32.060
Yep.

1010
01:06:32.228 --> 01:06:33.603
I'll tell you what you need to do.

1011
01:06:33.771 --> 01:06:36.857
Cannibalize the stub axle
off that old Ford right there.

1012
01:06:37.024 --> 01:06:39.317
- Okay.
- Lucky for you, I got some welding gear.

1013
01:06:39.485 --> 01:06:41.611
- We'll get a new wheel on there pronto.
- Good.

1014
01:06:50.913 --> 01:06:52.664
Okay. That's got it.

1015
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:58.003
- When you finish there...
- Yeah?

1016
01:06:58.171 --> 01:07:00.756
I got something that I wanna show you.

1017
01:07:00.923 --> 01:07:02.883
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1018
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:05.719
Oh, never you mind.

1019
01:07:05.887 --> 01:07:08.346
You just get that wheel on there right.

1020
01:07:08.514 --> 01:07:10.515
Yeah.

1021
01:07:21.194 --> 01:07:22.569
Why'd you bring me out here?

1022
01:07:22.737 --> 01:07:26.156
I, uh... I want to show you this.

1023
01:07:26.324 --> 01:07:29.868
- What?
- Right here.

1024
01:07:30.036 --> 01:07:32.746
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1025
01:07:32.914 --> 01:07:35.040
I, uh...

1026
01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:38.752
I laid my old boy to rest
12 years ago next week.

1027
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.754
- Oh, yeah?
- And I sure do miss him.

1028
01:07:40.922 --> 01:07:43.632
- Yeah?
- I sure do miss the old boy.

1029
01:07:44.717 --> 01:07:46.551
"He did his level best."

1030
01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.054
He did.

1031
01:07:49.222 --> 01:07:51.302
Well, I always figured a man's
like a blade of grass.

1032
01:07:51.432 --> 01:07:54.392
He grows up in the spring,
strong and healthy and green...

1033
01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.563
and then he reaches middle age,
and he ripens, as it were...

1034
01:07:58.731 --> 01:08:01.775
and then, in the autumn, he...

1035
01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:05.570
Like a blade of grass,
he finishes, just fades away...

1036
01:08:05.738 --> 01:08:09.741
and he never comes back.
Just like a blade of grass.

1037
01:08:09.909 --> 01:08:12.744
I think when you're dead, you're dead.

1038
01:08:12.912 --> 01:08:15.580
I always thought that,
since I grew up a bit.

1039
01:08:15.748 --> 01:08:17.916
Is that your philosophy?

1040
01:08:18.084 --> 01:08:19.918
Well, I don't know.
Yeah, I suppose it is.

1041
01:08:20.086 --> 01:08:23.380
When you get to my age, these thoughts
cross your mind sometimes, you know.

1042
01:08:26.259 --> 01:08:27.259
Jump!

1043
01:08:29.262 --> 01:08:32.889
Jump! Sideways!
You move sideways!

1044
01:08:33.057 --> 01:08:35.976
Oh, my God, man! Haven't you
ever seen a snake before?

1045
01:08:36.143 --> 01:08:37.894
No. We don't get
snakes in New Zealand.

1046
01:08:38.062 --> 01:08:40.730
Good God! I ought to move there.

1047
01:08:40.898 --> 01:08:42.774
- Where's he going?
- Damn rattlers!

1048
01:08:42.942 --> 01:08:45.110
Any more around here? Oh, God.

1049
01:08:45.278 --> 01:08:46.611
- Fancy this!
- What?

1050
01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:51.283
You come all this way
to bite the dust up at Boot Hill.

1051
01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:52.450
Yeah.

1052
01:08:53.786 --> 01:08:56.746
Be a laugh, wouldn't it?
Be a laugh.

1053
01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:02.752
Oh, my God.

1054
01:09:03.796 --> 01:09:04.796
Hey, Burt.

1055
01:09:04.964 --> 01:09:06.464
Huh?

1056
01:09:07.633 --> 01:09:09.801
Where are you gonna sleep tonight?

1057
01:09:11.304 --> 01:09:13.471
I don't know. I have no idea.

1058
01:09:15.766 --> 01:09:17.142
I don't know.

1059
01:09:36.662 --> 01:09:39.789
I had a strange dream last night.

1060
01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:44.377
I dreamt about my late...

1061
01:09:44.545 --> 01:09:46.338
twin brother...

1062
01:09:46.505 --> 01:09:48.840
Ernie.

1063
01:09:49.008 --> 01:09:54.220
I thought he was in the room,
here, looking down on us.

1064
01:09:54.388 --> 01:10:00.143
I guess it's all that fun and games
at the graveyard.

1065
01:10:03.022 --> 01:10:04.689
I suppose.

1066
01:10:04.857 --> 01:10:06.483
Oh, well.

1067
01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:10.362
Getting old ain't for the faint of heart,
I'll tell you that.

1068
01:10:10.529 --> 01:10:13.114
Oh, God! What have you
done to my back, Ada.

1069
01:10:13.991 --> 01:10:15.700
Oh!

1070
01:10:15.868 --> 01:10:18.411
Oh, I am getting old.

1071
01:10:20.206 --> 01:10:22.165
Hey, come on, old girl,
make me a cup of tea.

1072
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:24.417
I've gotta hit the road.

1073
01:10:24.585 --> 01:10:27.504
Ada, come on. You haven't died
in your sleep, have you, old girl?

1074
01:10:27.672 --> 01:10:31.424
- Have me a cup of tea.
- Mm. Come here, lover-boy.

1075
01:10:31.592 --> 01:10:33.802
I'll make it myself.

1076
01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:35.553
All right. Thanks.

1077
01:10:39.058 --> 01:10:42.268
Now, Burt, you promise me
you're gonna pop in on your way back...

1078
01:10:42.436 --> 01:10:45.271
because I can always use
another little cuddle.

1079
01:10:45.439 --> 01:10:47.732
Yeah, that's what I said, Ada.
That's what I intend to do.

1080
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.403
And there's many a good tune
played in an old banjo, as it were.

1081
01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:53.613
And what we don't use, we lose.

1082
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:55.281
Yeah, that's what they say.

1083
01:10:55.449 --> 01:10:57.701
See you. Ta-ta, darling.

1084
01:10:57.868 --> 01:11:01.246
And you have good luck with your Indian.

1085
01:11:01.414 --> 01:11:03.248
Yeah. You should say "break a leg."

1086
01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:07.460
See you.

1087
01:11:07.628 --> 01:11:08.712
Toorah!

1088
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:30.442
Good day. Boy, is it hot out there.

1089
01:11:31.527 --> 01:11:34.988
I bet the birds fly backwards around here
to keep the dust out of their eyes.

1090
01:11:35.156 --> 01:11:37.115
What can I get you?

1091
01:11:37.283 --> 01:11:40.452
- I'd like a cup of tea, please.
- Cup of tea?

1092
01:11:40.619 --> 01:11:44.998
Yeah, best drink for quenching
the thirst when the weather's hot.

1093
01:11:45.166 --> 01:11:47.167
We ain't seen a cup of tea in here, ever.

1094
01:11:47.334 --> 01:11:49.878
We got Coors.
We got Schlitz or Miller.

1095
01:11:50.046 --> 01:11:51.671
Or Coke. And whiskey.

1096
01:11:51.839 --> 01:11:53.173
Oh.

1097
01:11:54.008 --> 01:11:55.383
Well, I'll have Coke, then.

1098
01:12:00.639 --> 01:12:03.183
You know smoking's bad for you, don't you?

1099
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:04.642
Is that so?

1100
01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:08.146
Yeah. Personally, I don't smoke
and I don't drink.

1101
01:12:08.314 --> 01:12:10.274
I had the right education
from my dad on that one.

1102
01:12:10.441 --> 01:12:13.777
He was like King James I,
a great anti-smoking man.

1103
01:12:15.446 --> 01:12:18.198
Sounds like you're on a one-man
crusade there, grandpa.

1104
01:12:18.365 --> 01:12:20.492
Yeah. Well, you're born
with one pair of lungs...

1105
01:12:20.659 --> 01:12:22.619
so why destroy them with that muck?

1106
01:12:22.787 --> 01:12:25.872
Hm. Where are you from?
Where's your hometown?

1107
01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.042
- You English?
- Heavens, no. I'm no pommie.

1108
01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:32.629
- I'm from Invercargill in New Zealand.
- Where?

1109
01:12:32.797 --> 01:12:38.176
Invercargill.
I-N-V-E-R-C-A-R-G-I-L-L.

1110
01:12:38.344 --> 01:12:41.054
I spell it with one "L" sometimes
to save ink.

1111
01:12:45.184 --> 01:12:47.185
Got any of those critters over there?

1112
01:12:47.353 --> 01:12:48.853
Oh, yes. Much bigger, though.

1113
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:52.357
We breed them down there on big farms...

1114
01:12:52.525 --> 01:12:55.017
and cut off their antlers,
send them over to Hong Kong...

1115
01:12:55.027 --> 01:12:59.531
and they grind the antlers into dust
and they eat that stuff.

1116
01:12:59.698 --> 01:13:03.785
It must be some sort of
aphrodisiac or something.

1117
01:13:03.953 --> 01:13:05.912
Puts lead in your pants.

1118
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.997
You could do with some of that, eh, Leroy?

1119
01:13:09.542 --> 01:13:11.626
Yeah, Leroy.

1120
01:13:11.794 --> 01:13:12.919
Is she your girlfriend?

1121
01:13:13.921 --> 01:13:15.004
Wife.

1122
01:13:15.172 --> 01:13:19.551
Oh. Oh, dear. Oh.

1123
01:13:23.389 --> 01:13:25.056
Are you all right?

1124
01:13:43.576 --> 01:13:45.410
Oh, God.

1125
01:13:59.258 --> 01:14:02.677
Did you decide to leave Jackie
a tip after all?

1126
01:14:06.974 --> 01:14:08.766
Look, sir, if you're not feeling well...

1127
01:14:08.934 --> 01:14:11.174
you should drop in to the hospital
in the next town.

1128
01:14:11.312 --> 01:14:13.605
Oh, all right.

1129
01:14:13.772 --> 01:14:15.106
Right.

1130
01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.812
- Roll down your window.
- Eh?

1131
01:14:58.234 --> 01:15:00.109
What's the problem?

1132
01:15:00.277 --> 01:15:02.695
- You're parked illegally.
- Oh.

1133
01:15:02.863 --> 01:15:06.199
- You're a danger to passing traffic.
- Am I?

1134
01:15:06.367 --> 01:15:09.244
- Let's see your driver's license.
- Yeah. All right.

1135
01:15:11.455 --> 01:15:13.122
Here you are.

1136
01:15:15.668 --> 01:15:17.293
Now...

1137
01:15:19.505 --> 01:15:22.257
- Where are you from?
- I'm from New Zealand.

1138
01:15:22.424 --> 01:15:26.427
That's the land of the long,
white cloud. Aotearoa.

1139
01:15:26.595 --> 01:15:28.346
Home of the kiwi bird.

1140
01:15:28.514 --> 01:15:30.223
Now, I don't care if you're from Mars.

1141
01:15:30.391 --> 01:15:32.850
- You cannot stop here.
- All right.

1142
01:15:33.018 --> 01:15:36.187
You cannot stop on the side of this road.
You're parked illegally.

1143
01:15:36.355 --> 01:15:38.481
Okay, well, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1144
01:15:38.649 --> 01:15:44.028
I was having a bit of a heart attack and...
Well, recovering from one, anyway.

1145
01:15:44.196 --> 01:15:46.614
Well, next time, how about
we stop at a proper rest area?

1146
01:15:46.782 --> 01:15:49.701
All right. Thanks.
My name's Burt Munro.

1147
01:15:49.868 --> 01:15:51.828
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

1148
01:15:58.544 --> 01:15:59.711
Oil's okay.

1149
01:15:59.878 --> 01:16:02.380
- Thank you.
- That's all right, sir.

1150
01:16:02.548 --> 01:16:05.550
- Excuse me. Hi, there.
- Hi.

1151
01:16:05.718 --> 01:16:08.386
Listen, I was wondering
if I could catch a ride.

1152
01:16:08.554 --> 01:16:10.513
My car, she just broke down...

1153
01:16:10.681 --> 01:16:12.890
and I'm really trying to get
to Salt Lake City.

1154
01:16:13.058 --> 01:16:15.977
Well, I'm only going as far as Wendover.
That's where I'm stopping.

1155
01:16:16.145 --> 01:16:17.895
Well, anything would
be better than nothing.

1156
01:16:18.063 --> 01:16:21.232
- Ain't that the truth. Hop in, mate.
- Hey, thank you.

1157
01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:25.903
I'm gonna go see my girlfriend.

1158
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:28.573
She just moved from
L.A. to Salt Lake, so...

1159
01:16:28.741 --> 01:16:31.284
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm home on leave from 'Nam.

1160
01:16:31.452 --> 01:16:33.453
- Where?
- Vietnam?

1161
01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.996
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1162
01:16:35.164 --> 01:16:38.082
Hey, what is that you got
strapped on back there?

1163
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:41.919
Oh, that, young fellow, is an Indian.

1164
01:16:42.921 --> 01:16:44.339
Motorcycle.

1165
01:16:44.506 --> 01:16:46.883
So, what are you doing in Vietnam?

1166
01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:49.260
I'm involved in Operation Ranch Hand.

1167
01:16:49.428 --> 01:16:51.804
What's that? Farming or something?

1168
01:16:51.972 --> 01:16:54.932
No, not exactly.
We just started this program.

1169
01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:59.437
We are spraying the jungle
from the air with herbicides...

1170
01:16:59.605 --> 01:17:02.085
so the enemy, the Viet Cong,
don't have any place to hide.

1171
01:17:02.107 --> 01:17:04.734
- Oh.
- Agent Orange we call this stuff.

1172
01:17:04.902 --> 01:17:06.778
It comes in these big, orange drums.

1173
01:17:06.945 --> 01:17:08.905
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1174
01:17:09.073 --> 01:17:10.323
How is it working out?

1175
01:17:10.491 --> 01:17:14.035
Um, well, I'm home on two weeks' leave.

1176
01:17:14.203 --> 01:17:15.995
Then I gotta get my ass back there.

1177
01:17:16.163 --> 01:17:18.483
But we should have this war done
in about six months or so.

1178
01:17:18.624 --> 01:17:20.249
That's what they keep telling us.

1179
01:17:20.417 --> 01:17:22.897
I can't wait to get my ass out of there,
to tell you the truth.

1180
01:17:23.045 --> 01:17:27.131
Yeah. I remember
the Great War, 1914.

1181
01:17:27.299 --> 01:17:32.178
I was about your age, and that's
what they kept telling everyone.

1182
01:17:32.346 --> 01:17:34.263
"It'll soon be over."

1183
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:38.518
Twenty million dead and four years later,
it was still going on.

1184
01:17:38.685 --> 01:17:41.479
Not as bad as the big flu epidemic, though.

1185
01:17:41.647 --> 01:17:45.358
Killed 21 million, that did.
Or maybe more.

1186
01:17:45.526 --> 01:17:47.860
Every day, when I left to go to work...

1187
01:17:48.028 --> 01:17:50.488
my mom would spray some
formalin on my shirt...

1188
01:17:50.656 --> 01:17:55.368
and maybe that's why I didn't catch it.

1189
01:17:55.536 --> 01:17:57.078
Or maybe I was just lucky.

1190
01:17:57.246 --> 01:17:59.539
You never know.

1191
01:17:59.706 --> 01:18:01.332
Whew. Knock on wood.

1192
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.792
Yep.

1193
01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:06.212
You know, life's a funny thing.

1194
01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.756
You never know what's
around the corner, do you?

1195
01:18:10.634 --> 01:18:12.635
"Your shaving brush...

1196
01:18:12.803 --> 01:18:14.887
has had its day."

1197
01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:17.181
"So why not shave...

1198
01:18:17.349 --> 01:18:19.809
the modern way?

1199
01:18:21.103 --> 01:18:24.230
Burma-Shave."

1200
01:18:24.398 --> 01:18:26.357
"If she doesn't kiss you...

1201
01:18:26.525 --> 01:18:28.151
like she used to..."

1202
01:18:28.318 --> 01:18:30.111
"Perhaps she's seeing...

1203
01:18:30.279 --> 01:18:32.029
some smoother rooster.

1204
01:18:32.197 --> 01:18:34.198
Burma-Shave."

1205
01:18:34.366 --> 01:18:38.244
"These signs we dedicate...

1206
01:18:38.412 --> 01:18:42.915
to the men who've had no date of late.

1207
01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:44.917
Burma-Shave."

1208
01:18:45.085 --> 01:18:46.878
Yeah, that's us.

1209
01:18:47.045 --> 01:18:48.421
Or you, anyway.

1210
01:18:54.803 --> 01:18:56.596
Look at that.

1211
01:18:56.763 --> 01:18:59.682
Ooh, that's a cowboy and a half.

1212
01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.480
I was thinking I'd come out
to the Salt with you.

1213
01:19:03.604 --> 01:19:07.064
I'd like to be there the first time you
see it. It's only a couple miles up the road.

1214
01:19:07.232 --> 01:19:09.609
Yeah. All right, then. That sounds good.

1215
01:19:09.776 --> 01:19:12.256
Looks like there's a lot of people
in town for Speed Week, huh?

1216
01:19:12.404 --> 01:19:13.988
Yeah, looks like it.

1217
01:19:15.574 --> 01:19:17.700
Oh, this is it, Burt.

1218
01:19:17.868 --> 01:19:21.579
- You're gonna take a left right up here.
- Yeah.

1219
01:19:31.882 --> 01:19:33.925
I'm at Bonneville.

1220
01:19:34.092 --> 01:19:35.760
I can't believe it.

1221
01:19:35.928 --> 01:19:37.136
I mean, I'm here.

1222
01:19:37.304 --> 01:19:39.430
I've made it.
Ha, ha, ha.

1223
01:19:39.932 --> 01:19:41.516
I've made it.

1224
01:20:09.127 --> 01:20:12.630
You know, all my life,
I've wanted to do something big...

1225
01:20:12.798 --> 01:20:16.008
something bigger and better
than all the other jokers.

1226
01:20:17.219 --> 01:20:19.178
This is it. Bonneville.

1227
01:20:19.346 --> 01:20:24.600
This is the place where big things happen.

1228
01:20:27.396 --> 01:20:32.191
Do you realize, Rusty, the fastest man
has ever gone on land is here?

1229
01:20:32.359 --> 01:20:34.819
Right here, where we are now.

1230
01:20:35.862 --> 01:20:37.154
Huh.

1231
01:20:37.322 --> 01:20:41.409
Malcolm Campbell did it here with Bluebird.

1232
01:20:41.577 --> 01:20:43.953
First guy to go over 300 mile an hour...

1233
01:20:44.121 --> 01:20:46.831
and then later his son Donald Campbell
was here with Proteus.

1234
01:20:46.999 --> 01:20:51.168
He crashed at 350 miles an hour
and lived to tell the tale.

1235
01:20:52.671 --> 01:20:55.172
John Cobb was here.

1236
01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:59.135
First guy to go over 400 miles an hour.

1237
01:20:59.303 --> 01:21:01.554
All the great attempts.

1238
01:21:01.722 --> 01:21:03.681
George Easton with Thunderbolt...

1239
01:21:03.849 --> 01:21:08.519
and Mickey Thompson with Challenger.

1240
01:21:11.481 --> 01:21:15.234
I'm telling you, Rusty,
this place is holy ground, mate.

1241
01:21:15.402 --> 01:21:18.070
Holy ground.

1242
01:21:18.238 --> 01:21:20.531
And I made it here.

1243
01:21:49.728 --> 01:21:51.479
- Well, Burt...
- Yeah?

1244
01:21:51.647 --> 01:21:54.231
Thanks a million. We'll be looking
for you in the record books.

1245
01:21:54.399 --> 01:21:56.567
You take care over there in Vietnam,
won't you?

1246
01:21:56.735 --> 01:21:58.235
I'll be trying.

1247
01:21:58.403 --> 01:21:59.904
- Go ahead, mate.
- Drive safe.

1248
01:22:00.072 --> 01:22:02.198
- See you.
- See you.

1249
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:20.484
God.

1250
01:23:28.577 --> 01:23:30.161
Oh!

1251
01:23:31.621 --> 01:23:33.581
Thank God.

1252
01:23:48.054 --> 01:23:50.264
Jesus. Yeah.

1253
01:24:22.672 --> 01:24:25.007
- Good day.
- Hey there.

1254
01:24:27.385 --> 01:24:29.178
- It's gonna be a great day.
- Yeah.

1255
01:24:29.346 --> 01:24:32.431
Still. No wind.

1256
01:24:32.599 --> 01:24:34.266
Lovely day for a run.

1257
01:24:36.353 --> 01:24:37.728
Salt's in good shape.

1258
01:24:37.896 --> 01:24:39.897
Yeah. Firm and dry.

1259
01:24:40.065 --> 01:24:42.399
Dead flat, no soft patches.

1260
01:24:42.567 --> 01:24:44.026
Not like the beach.

1261
01:24:45.695 --> 01:24:48.280
Yeah. I can do it here.

1262
01:24:48.448 --> 01:24:52.326
Yep. This week.
That's what we're here for.

1263
01:24:52.994 --> 01:24:54.578
Yeah.

1264
01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:59.124
God, is that yours?

1265
01:24:59.292 --> 01:25:00.376
Yep.

1266
01:25:01.086 --> 01:25:03.587
Oh, she's a beauty.

1267
01:25:03.755 --> 01:25:06.549
I'll bet she goes fast.

1268
01:25:06.716 --> 01:25:09.260
- Is that yours?
- Yeah. It's an old Indian.

1269
01:25:09.719 --> 01:25:12.721
My name is Munro, Burt Munro,
from down under, New Zealand.

1270
01:25:12.889 --> 01:25:14.682
- Long way from home.
- Yeah.

1271
01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:17.142
Jim Moffett, San Jose, California.

1272
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:19.436
- Nice to meet you, Burt.
- Good to meet you, Jim.

1273
01:25:19.604 --> 01:25:22.857
Next on the
starting line, the Moffett Racing entry...

1274
01:25:25.443 --> 01:25:30.656
Racing Downs. Driven by Jim Moffett,
San Jose, California...

1275
01:25:47.674 --> 01:25:49.592
Come on, let's go.

1276
01:25:57.809 --> 01:26:00.144
- Morning.
- Hello. Burt Munro.

1277
01:26:00.312 --> 01:26:01.645
- Mike.
- Mike?

1278
01:26:01.813 --> 01:26:03.898
Are you checked in?

1279
01:26:04.065 --> 01:26:05.733
No. Not yet.

1280
01:26:05.901 --> 01:26:09.361
Well, you know, you gotta remove the
shell before we do the tech inspection.

1281
01:26:09.529 --> 01:26:11.113
Where do I check in?

1282
01:26:11.281 --> 01:26:13.115
- It's just over there.
- Thanks, fellas.

1283
01:26:13.283 --> 01:26:15.075
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1284
01:26:16.828 --> 01:26:18.203
Gotta see this.

1285
01:26:18.371 --> 01:26:20.497
Hello. I've come to check in.

1286
01:26:20.665 --> 01:26:21.999
Munro. Burt Munro.

1287
01:26:22.167 --> 01:26:25.502
- Registration number?
- What?

1288
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.339
Registration number.
I don't see your number here.

1289
01:26:29.341 --> 01:26:32.176
Oh, no, it's 35.

1290
01:26:32.344 --> 01:26:34.887
It's on the side
of my motorcycle over there.

1291
01:26:35.055 --> 01:26:38.015
- That's my lucky number.
- Have you registered?

1292
01:26:39.267 --> 01:26:41.727
No. That's what I come for.

1293
01:26:41.895 --> 01:26:44.521
These two blokes sent me over here.
Mike and someone else.

1294
01:26:44.689 --> 01:26:46.482
Sir, registration closed last month.

1295
01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:50.819
If you haven't registered, I'm sorry,
you just can't run.

1296
01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:56.241
I can't run? I mean, uh...

1297
01:26:56.409 --> 01:26:59.078
Well, how was I supposed to know
I should have pre-registered?

1298
01:26:59.245 --> 01:27:01.705
I mean, I've come a heck of a long way
to run my bike.

1299
01:27:01.873 --> 01:27:04.208
You know, I'm not going anywhere
until I've done just that.

1300
01:27:04.376 --> 01:27:07.378
I've come all the way from New Zealand,
you know? It's a long way.

1301
01:27:07.545 --> 01:27:09.065
Look, mister, we don't make the rules.

1302
01:27:09.214 --> 01:27:12.049
You know, an event like this doesn't
just happen in one day.

1303
01:27:12.217 --> 01:27:14.218
Rules are rules.
Entries closed July 31 st.

1304
01:27:14.386 --> 01:27:15.844
But, crikey, I live in Invercargill.

1305
01:27:16.012 --> 01:27:18.222
It's halfway around the bloody Earth,
you know?

1306
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:20.307
How was I supposed to know these things?

1307
01:27:20.475 --> 01:27:22.915
- I didn't know all this stuff.
- Sir, that's not our problem.

1308
01:27:23.019 --> 01:27:25.339
I thought I could just turn up here
and have my bike timed.

1309
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.389
You don't have to call me "sir."
My name's Munro.

1310
01:27:27.399 --> 01:27:29.024
Well, sir, you thought wrong.

1311
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:40.494
Here, Jim. Jim Moffett!

1312
01:27:40.662 --> 01:27:43.163
It's Burt Munro.
Could you come over here, mate?

1313
01:27:43.331 --> 01:27:45.749
Hey, I'll be right back.

1314
01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.126
I need a bit of help.

1315
01:27:47.293 --> 01:27:49.461
Hey, Burt. What's up?

1316
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:50.921
Well, I need your help.

1317
01:27:51.089 --> 01:27:53.382
These blokes are telling me
I can't run my bike...

1318
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:55.384
because I'm not pre-registered.

1319
01:27:55.552 --> 01:27:57.970
- You didn't register?
- No. I didn't know anything about it.

1320
01:27:58.138 --> 01:28:01.098
You know how it is, Jim.
Rules are rules.

1321
01:28:01.266 --> 01:28:03.017
Burt, you should have
registered months ago.

1322
01:28:03.184 --> 01:28:04.810
I didn't know.

1323
01:28:04.978 --> 01:28:08.105
Look, I'll have a talk with these guys later,
see if I can change their minds.

1324
01:28:08.273 --> 01:28:11.191
- Blood's worth bottling.
- I don't know about that.

1325
01:28:11.359 --> 01:28:13.944
Look, we can talk about this later.

1326
01:28:14.112 --> 01:28:17.656
Maybe you can let him go through
tech inspection, get that out of the way.

1327
01:28:17.824 --> 01:28:19.658
Just in case we can let him run.

1328
01:28:19.826 --> 01:28:21.577
You're asking a lot.

1329
01:28:23.121 --> 01:28:25.205
Right.

1330
01:28:27.792 --> 01:28:28.792
Okay.

1331
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.210
- All right.
- What?

1332
01:28:30.378 --> 01:28:32.296
- Make me proud.
- Thanks a lot.

1333
01:28:32.464 --> 01:28:35.257
Gave me a bit of a fight there.

1334
01:28:39.137 --> 01:28:42.264
You know, these don't look
like high-speed tires.

1335
01:28:42.432 --> 01:28:44.850
Well, they are high-speed tires.

1336
01:28:45.018 --> 01:28:48.312
Look at these hairline cracks.
These tires gotta be 25 years old.

1337
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.731
- What happened to the tread?
- What?

1338
01:28:50.899 --> 01:28:53.067
- I said, what happened to the tread?
- I cut it off.

1339
01:28:53.234 --> 01:28:55.434
That's what happened.
I cut it off with a carving knife.

1340
01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:57.821
Otherwise, it wouldn't be
a high-speed tire, would it?

1341
01:28:57.989 --> 01:28:59.198
What are you talking about?

1342
01:28:59.365 --> 01:29:01.325
You got to keep the weight down,
haven't you, son?

1343
01:29:01.493 --> 01:29:03.994
Or when you get it to a high speed,
the centrifugal force...

1344
01:29:04.162 --> 01:29:05.662
would throw the tread right off.

1345
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:09.500
I run them on 65 pounds of air.
That tire's safe up to 300 mile an hour.

1346
01:29:09.667 --> 01:29:12.503
I guarantee it. These are high-speed tires,
and I made them.

1347
01:29:12.670 --> 01:29:16.215
Well, you're gonna have to replace them.
The suspension here is a leaf-spring.

1348
01:29:16.382 --> 01:29:17.674
I mean, can we pass that?

1349
01:29:17.842 --> 01:29:21.011
Jeez, last leaf-spring on a motorcycle
must have been in the 1920s.

1350
01:29:21.179 --> 01:29:22.721
Well, it is 42 years old.

1351
01:29:22.889 --> 01:29:24.515
These brakes are completely inadequate.

1352
01:29:24.682 --> 01:29:26.934
I'm planning on going, not stopping.
Ha, ha, ha.

1353
01:29:27.102 --> 01:29:29.103
The brakes were old-fashioned 40 years ago.

1354
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:32.481
- Yeah.
- Is this a hinge off a fence post?

1355
01:29:32.649 --> 01:29:34.858
No. That's from an old kitchen door.

1356
01:29:37.445 --> 01:29:40.364
Let me just ask you, what is this?

1357
01:29:40.532 --> 01:29:43.293
It's a cork. What does it look like?
It's a cork from a brandy bottle.

1358
01:29:43.451 --> 01:29:47.746
The thing is, it's all about weight.
The less weight, the faster you go.

1359
01:29:47.914 --> 01:29:50.040
- Where's your chute?
- What?

1360
01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:52.793
- Where's your parachute?
- I'm not planning on bailing out.

1361
01:29:52.961 --> 01:29:56.547
- No. You've got to have a safety chute.
- I can't afford one.

1362
01:29:57.382 --> 01:30:00.092
These forks, if they give out,
we got ourselves a real problem.

1363
01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:03.345
I think I'd have a bit of a problem
that way, wouldn't I?

1364
01:30:03.513 --> 01:30:04.793
- Where's your fire suit?
- What?

1365
01:30:04.931 --> 01:30:06.098
Where's your fire suit?

1366
01:30:06.266 --> 01:30:08.809
Good heavens, man.
I don't intend to burst into flames.

1367
01:30:08.977 --> 01:30:11.436
Always wear my
old suit pants for good luck.

1368
01:30:11.604 --> 01:30:15.149
If they were good enough to get married in,
they're good enough to ride this old girl in.

1369
01:30:15.316 --> 01:30:18.735
And, you know, I just tuck the legs of my
pants into my socks like this, you know...

1370
01:30:18.903 --> 01:30:21.655
stop them getting caught in the chain
and Bob's your uncle.

1371
01:30:21.823 --> 01:30:23.143
Okay. So you got your suit pants.

1372
01:30:23.283 --> 01:30:24.950
- What are you gonna wear on top?
- What?

1373
01:30:25.118 --> 01:30:28.078
You got your suit pants on the bottom.
What do you intend to wear on top?

1374
01:30:28.246 --> 01:30:31.915
Yes, a black woolen shirt,
New Zealand wool, water-resistant...

1375
01:30:32.083 --> 01:30:34.168
fire-resistant, and me bash hat.

1376
01:30:34.335 --> 01:30:36.753
- Your bash hat?
- Bash hat.

1377
01:30:36.921 --> 01:30:38.463
- Crash helmet.
- You're crazy.

1378
01:30:38.631 --> 01:30:41.091
You gotta wear, like,
at least a leather jacket on top.

1379
01:30:41.259 --> 01:30:44.261
You put the bike down on the salt,
it's like coarse sandpaper.

1380
01:30:44.429 --> 01:30:47.269
- It's gonna rub your head right off.
- I couldn't get into the shell...

1381
01:30:47.432 --> 01:30:49.558
with anything bulkier
than the shirt on my back.

1382
01:30:49.726 --> 01:30:52.603
- I mean, it's a very tight fit in there.
- Straight out of the ark.

1383
01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:55.689
- What did you say?
- Straight out of the ark.

1384
01:30:55.857 --> 01:30:58.442
Why are you being so cheeky?
What's your name, young man?

1385
01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:01.195
McFarland. Mike McFarland.

1386
01:31:01.362 --> 01:31:04.031
I knew a McFarland. He used
to sell milking machines in Timaru.

1387
01:31:04.199 --> 01:31:06.825
You must be related to him
because he was a total prick.

1388
01:31:06.993 --> 01:31:09.453
You don't even have
a fire extinguisher installed.

1389
01:31:09.621 --> 01:31:12.789
Mike McFarland used to give me
milking-machine parts...

1390
01:31:12.957 --> 01:31:15.834
- to make my sprockets with.
- Just how old are you?

1391
01:31:16.002 --> 01:31:17.961
I don't know.
He was about 35 when I knew...

1392
01:31:18.129 --> 01:31:19.129
No. How old are you?

1393
01:31:19.297 --> 01:31:22.716
His brother owned the general store,
down at a place called Bulls.

1394
01:31:22.884 --> 01:31:25.844
- That's a town in New Zealand.
- Sir, your machine is not safe.

1395
01:31:26.012 --> 01:31:28.847
I've been doing this for 43 years,
and I'm still here to tell the tale.

1396
01:31:29.015 --> 01:31:32.351
Well, times change. We started taking
airplanes instead of riding horseback.

1397
01:31:32.518 --> 01:31:34.144
- Horsepower?
- Horseback.

1398
01:31:34.312 --> 01:31:36.313
Horseback. Yeah, I got you. Yeah.

1399
01:31:36.481 --> 01:31:38.232
You're too old.

1400
01:31:38.399 --> 01:31:40.984
Bollocks. I may have this
saggy skin on the outside...

1401
01:31:41.152 --> 01:31:42.832
but inside, I'm still 18 years old.

1402
01:31:42.862 --> 01:31:46.573
I'd give you a run for your money,
young fella.

1403
01:31:46.741 --> 01:31:50.077
- Need some help?
- Oh, hello.

1404
01:31:50.245 --> 01:31:53.372
Rolly Freed, Marty Dickerson.
We're a couple of bike fans.

1405
01:31:53.539 --> 01:31:55.666
Oh. Burt Munro from kiwi-land.

1406
01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:57.501
A pleasure, Burt.

1407
01:31:59.128 --> 01:32:00.754
- You got me good there.
- Yeah.

1408
01:32:00.922 --> 01:32:02.172
Where are you staying?

1409
01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:04.508
Well, that's my salubrious accommodation.

1410
01:32:04.676 --> 01:32:07.344
I usually sleep at night in the back seat.

1411
01:32:07.512 --> 01:32:09.596
Salubrious, you say, Munro, huh?

1412
01:32:09.764 --> 01:32:11.556
We been hearing a lot about you.

1413
01:32:11.724 --> 01:32:13.934
Sounds like you're cutting
your finances mighty fine.

1414
01:32:14.102 --> 01:32:15.686
Oh, yeah. You can say that again.

1415
01:32:15.853 --> 01:32:18.272
Well, we're up at the Western Ridge.
Why don't you drop by?

1416
01:32:18.439 --> 01:32:21.191
Looks like you could use a shower
and everybody's staying there...

1417
01:32:21.359 --> 01:32:23.527
and I bet that there's
a spare bed there too.

1418
01:32:23.695 --> 01:32:25.988
Well, thanks a lot.
You Yanks are classic, you know that?

1419
01:32:26.155 --> 01:32:29.157
You don't catch me that easily.

1420
01:32:34.372 --> 01:32:35.872
Hey, Burt.

1421
01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.249
Hello.

1422
01:32:39.210 --> 01:32:43.714
The front forks could go at any time,
the suspension is right out of the 1920s...

1423
01:32:43.881 --> 01:32:46.049
he's got hairline cracks
all over his tires...

1424
01:32:46.217 --> 01:32:49.219
he's got no fire extinguisher,
no safety chute.

1425
01:32:49.387 --> 01:32:52.639
I told you, if it's a time problem, the old
guy's welcome to use some of my time.

1426
01:32:52.807 --> 01:32:55.017
It's not a time problem,
it's a bike problem.

1427
01:32:55.184 --> 01:32:56.935
Well, I think we ought to let him run.

1428
01:32:57.103 --> 01:32:59.730
He came all the way from
New Zealand to do this.

1429
01:32:59.897 --> 01:33:01.982
Jim, have you had a good look
at his machine?

1430
01:33:02.150 --> 01:33:04.693
All I know is,
the man's the genuine article.

1431
01:33:04.861 --> 01:33:06.778
Well, the bike is a genuine dinosaur.

1432
01:33:06.946 --> 01:33:09.448
Look, we carry the can
for the decisions around here.

1433
01:33:09.615 --> 01:33:12.655
If the old fart kills himself...
And it's about 100-to-1 that he will, right?

1434
01:33:12.744 --> 01:33:15.746
We are gonna have a hell of a lot
of trouble on our hands.

1435
01:33:15.913 --> 01:33:19.958
Yeah. It sounds like we're a bunch
of chickenshits, if you want my opinion.

1436
01:33:20.126 --> 01:33:24.880
His bike didn't even come close
to passing tech inspection, Jim.

1437
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:37.100
- Burt.
- Hello, Jim. Come in.

1438
01:33:37.268 --> 01:33:39.061
Rolly Freed said I could find you here.

1439
01:33:39.228 --> 01:33:41.980
Rolly Freed, yeah. Ah, he's the best.
He's a real gentleman.

1440
01:33:42.148 --> 01:33:45.275
You know, he set me up
at this place for nothing.

1441
01:33:48.112 --> 01:33:49.279
What are you doing?

1442
01:33:49.447 --> 01:33:51.907
Well, the soft shoe polish
fills in the cracks...

1443
01:33:52.075 --> 01:33:54.451
makes the tires look spic and span...

1444
01:33:54.619 --> 01:33:56.787
good as new and cheaper
than new ones, anyway.

1445
01:33:57.497 --> 01:33:59.122
I didn't see that.

1446
01:34:01.417 --> 01:34:03.794
Well, can I run?

1447
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:07.631
I'm sorry, Burt.

1448
01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:17.474
Who the heck do they think they are?

1449
01:34:17.642 --> 01:34:21.269
Crikey, Jim, you know,
I'm not trying to run a mile in four minutes.

1450
01:34:21.437 --> 01:34:24.064
All I've got to do is sit there
and open up the throttle.

1451
01:34:24.232 --> 01:34:27.734
I mean, after all,
it's my ruddy life, isn't it?

1452
01:34:28.694 --> 01:34:30.821
Can't you do anything?

1453
01:34:30.988 --> 01:34:34.783
I mean, I just want to try and get her
to go over 200 just once, that's all.

1454
01:34:34.951 --> 01:34:35.992
Once I've cracked 200...

1455
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.480
I'll be quite happy to piss off back home
to New Zealand and Bob's your uncle.

1456
01:34:40.206 --> 01:34:43.542
You're a well-respected man, aren't you?
Couldn't you talk to them?

1457
01:34:44.377 --> 01:34:45.585
I tried.

1458
01:34:46.212 --> 01:34:48.922
I mean, you've got as much chance
of writing yourself off as I have.

1459
01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:52.259
You know that. Just talk to them again.

1460
01:34:53.678 --> 01:34:55.637
I know they'll listen to you, mate.

1461
01:34:57.890 --> 01:35:00.225
Okay, Burt, I'll try.

1462
01:35:00.393 --> 01:35:02.144
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

1463
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:09.276
I mean, I'm half the age of some
of those characters out there.

1464
01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:19.453
- What's that?
- Oh, that's just indigestion.

1465
01:35:24.125 --> 01:35:25.876
You see, everyone wants us old buggers...

1466
01:35:26.043 --> 01:35:29.713
to curl up in some quiet corner and die.

1467
01:35:29.881 --> 01:35:34.551
Well, Burt Munro is not ready to finish yet,
I'll tell you that, mate.

1468
01:35:36.387 --> 01:35:38.889
I'll give it a shot,
but I'm not promising anything.

1469
01:35:39.056 --> 01:35:41.766
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot.

1470
01:35:46.731 --> 01:35:50.358
The famous
Mickey Johnson car, Challenger I.

1471
01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:03.163
- Where's he going?
- Didn't Jim tell him?

1472
01:36:03.331 --> 01:36:05.999
- He says he did.
- Then what's he doing here?

1473
01:36:06.167 --> 01:36:07.250
Why won't you let him run?

1474
01:36:07.418 --> 01:36:09.753
Hey, he's too old and his bike's too old.

1475
01:36:09.921 --> 01:36:12.297
I hear he come halfway around the world
to ride that cycle.

1476
01:36:12.465 --> 01:36:13.882
Yeah. Come on.

1477
01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:15.842
Wendy, if he was to kill himself...

1478
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:18.637
So? It's his life.

1479
01:36:18.804 --> 01:36:21.097
Keep an eye out for those officials.

1480
01:36:21.265 --> 01:36:23.266
You sure?
I don't think it's such a good idea.

1481
01:36:23.434 --> 01:36:25.727
If we're gonna do this damn thing,
you gotta hurry.

1482
01:36:25.895 --> 01:36:28.563
All right. Let's go.
Here's your helmet.

1483
01:36:29.607 --> 01:36:31.775
Here's your goggles.

1484
01:36:31.943 --> 01:36:34.069
- Come on, Burt. We gotta go.
- Yeah, right.

1485
01:36:34.237 --> 01:36:36.196
Put them on. Put them on.

1486
01:36:39.992 --> 01:36:41.993
Go! Come on!

1487
01:36:45.331 --> 01:36:47.040
Okay, let's go.

1488
01:36:47.208 --> 01:36:49.125
Push. Go fast!

1489
01:36:49.293 --> 01:36:51.461
Hey, you can't... Hey! You can't do that!

1490
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:53.296
Come on! Come on!

1491
01:36:53.464 --> 01:36:55.131
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!

1492
01:36:55.299 --> 01:36:56.967
Hang on! Whoa!

1493
01:36:59.971 --> 01:37:02.013
Hey, where are you going with that?

1494
01:37:06.936 --> 01:37:09.854
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

1495
01:37:10.022 --> 01:37:12.148
What the hell are you doing, Burt?

1496
01:37:12.316 --> 01:37:15.694
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just getting her warmed up, Bob.

1497
01:37:15.861 --> 01:37:17.520
Didn't look like you were
getting her warmed up.

1498
01:37:17.530 --> 01:37:19.656
Jesus. He was gonna take
the thing for a fricking run.

1499
01:37:19.824 --> 01:37:22.200
Bob. Oh, boy.

1500
01:37:22.368 --> 01:37:24.160
Okay.

1501
01:37:24.328 --> 01:37:26.621
That is the most determined man
I've ever seen in my life.

1502
01:37:26.789 --> 01:37:28.164
Yeah.

1503
01:37:28.332 --> 01:37:31.334
I kind of feel sorry for the old coot...

1504
01:37:31.502 --> 01:37:34.170
coming all this way, huh?

1505
01:37:34.338 --> 01:37:36.172
Isn't there some way we can
accommodate him?

1506
01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:37.841
There can't be much risk there.

1507
01:37:38.009 --> 01:37:42.178
His bike will be lucky if it does 70.
What do you say?

1508
01:37:42.346 --> 01:37:46.057
Why don't we bend the rules this once, huh?

1509
01:37:47.351 --> 01:37:48.393
Jesus.

1510
01:37:48.561 --> 01:37:50.562
- Burt.
- Yeah?

1511
01:37:51.689 --> 01:37:53.773
Bob and I had a little chat...

1512
01:37:53.941 --> 01:37:57.068
and we're thinking we're gonna
organize a handling run for you.

1513
01:37:57.236 --> 01:38:00.322
- You are? What?
- Well, a handling run.

1514
01:38:00.489 --> 01:38:02.649
All the officials, we're gonna
get into our vehicles...

1515
01:38:02.742 --> 01:38:04.034
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not.

1516
01:38:04.201 --> 01:38:08.038
We're gonna follow along behind you
and see if you're okay to ride this beast.

1517
01:38:08.205 --> 01:38:09.539
Of course I'm okay to ride it.

1518
01:38:09.707 --> 01:38:12.542
First thing tomorrow morning, all right?
Bright and early.

1519
01:38:14.503 --> 01:38:16.963
Thanks, fellas.

1520
01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:19.674
I'll see you, then.

1521
01:38:22.553 --> 01:38:23.720
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1522
01:38:23.888 --> 01:38:25.347
Don't hurt yourself.

1523
01:38:36.567 --> 01:38:39.944
Okay, everyone listen up!
This is what we're gonna do!

1524
01:38:40.112 --> 01:38:42.572
Burt, you're gonna get rolling, all right?

1525
01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:46.576
Ride slowly along. We'll all jump in our
vehicles, follow you down the track.

1526
01:38:46.744 --> 01:38:49.264
- See if you can handle this thing.
- I'll handle her all right.

1527
01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:50.914
All right. Everybody got that?

1528
01:38:51.082 --> 01:38:54.834
Okay. Let's get in the cars.

1529
01:38:56.671 --> 01:38:58.254
All right. Sounds good.

1530
01:39:17.858 --> 01:39:20.360
Hope the old man doesn't
make a fool of himself.

1531
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:27.283
- Here we go.
- In here. Okay.

1532
01:39:27.451 --> 01:39:30.870
Right-o. I'm ready. Let's go!
Go ahead, push it!

1533
01:39:31.038 --> 01:39:32.664
Come on! Push it, boys!

1534
01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:36.876
- Go, Burt!
- Whoa!

1535
01:40:00.025 --> 01:40:03.528
Sixty, 65, 70.

1536
01:40:04.905 --> 01:40:06.364
Attaboy, Burt!

1537
01:40:06.532 --> 01:40:07.949
Seventy-five.

1538
01:40:08.117 --> 01:40:11.411
There he goes, up to 80, 85.

1539
01:40:15.499 --> 01:40:16.499
Ninety.

1540
01:40:24.508 --> 01:40:26.843
Ninety-five. Look at that man go!

1541
01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:40.315
- Holy smoke!
- He's leaving them behind!

1542
01:40:40.483 --> 01:40:41.941
What the hell is that old guy up to?

1543
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:43.829
Nobody told him he
could give it everything.

1544
01:40:43.986 --> 01:40:46.321
Well, that solves the question
of whether he can handle it.

1545
01:40:46.489 --> 01:40:49.616
I'm doing 95, and he left us in the dust.

1546
01:40:49.784 --> 01:40:52.035
- Way to go!
- Attaboy, Burt!

1547
01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.243
All right. Grab hold of her.

1548
01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:35.328
Got enough room? Got it?

1549
01:41:35.496 --> 01:41:37.622
Don't let her go.

1550
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:39.749
Oh, that was a disaster.

1551
01:41:39.917 --> 01:41:42.544
Hey, Burt, how'd it go?

1552
01:41:42.711 --> 01:41:43.753
Not good.

1553
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:49.968
So, what's the verdict?

1554
01:41:50.135 --> 01:41:52.929
When you opened up there in top gear,
you sure left us in the dust.

1555
01:41:53.097 --> 01:41:55.098
I couldn't even get it out of second gear.

1556
01:41:55.266 --> 01:41:57.267
The plugs were oiling up, so I had to...

1557
01:41:57.434 --> 01:41:59.894
feed it some more juice, you know,
up the revs a little.

1558
01:42:00.062 --> 01:42:03.940
Well, I guess we'll see if you're
telling us the truth, Munro.

1559
01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:08.111
You telling me I can officially run
my bike on the track and have it timed?

1560
01:42:08.279 --> 01:42:10.530
That's what I'm saying, Burt.

1561
01:42:11.699 --> 01:42:14.784
You'll never know what this
means to me, Otto.

1562
01:42:14.952 --> 01:42:18.538
Twenty-five years I've dreamed
of this day. Twenty-five years.

1563
01:42:18.706 --> 01:42:20.456
Sometimes you gotta
bend the rules a little.

1564
01:42:20.624 --> 01:42:21.875
Today's one of those days.

1565
01:42:22.042 --> 01:42:24.836
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart. Thank you.

1566
01:42:25.004 --> 01:42:26.880
Hey, Burt!

1567
01:42:27.047 --> 01:42:29.132
- Burt.
- What?

1568
01:42:30.593 --> 01:42:32.719
- Oh.
- What did they say?

1569
01:42:32.887 --> 01:42:34.429
What happened?

1570
01:42:34.597 --> 01:42:36.806
Well, they said I could run.

1571
01:42:36.974 --> 01:42:40.101
- That's great!
- Yeah.

1572
01:42:40.269 --> 01:42:42.645
- So why the long face, then?
- Well, I don't know.

1573
01:42:42.813 --> 01:42:45.857
It's just starting to sink in,
and I've got a problem, a big problem.

1574
01:42:46.025 --> 01:42:49.652
As soon as I get over 110,
it starts to wobble like heck.

1575
01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:51.154
I mean, a bad speed wobble.

1576
01:42:51.322 --> 01:42:53.922
Well, Burt, it looked like it was
about as stable as my last wife.

1577
01:42:54.033 --> 01:42:56.326
Yeah.

1578
01:42:56.493 --> 01:42:58.828
I've got a theory, and I think I'm right.

1579
01:42:58.996 --> 01:43:01.873
I need about 20 car batteries.

1580
01:43:02.041 --> 01:43:03.458
- Twenty?
- Yeah.

1581
01:43:03.626 --> 01:43:05.793
You think it's okay to steal
these batteries, Burt?

1582
01:43:05.961 --> 01:43:08.121
We're not stealing them, Marty,
we're souveniring them.

1583
01:43:08.255 --> 01:43:12.008
Be careful of that acid right there.
All right. What do we do with them now?

1584
01:43:12.176 --> 01:43:15.470
Well, we've got to talk someone into
lending us a painter's blowtorch.

1585
01:43:15.638 --> 01:43:17.180
A painter's blowtorch?

1586
01:43:19.266 --> 01:43:21.643
What are we gonna do
with all this metal, Burt?

1587
01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:26.898
Well, when this cools down,
we'll have ourselves a lead brick.

1588
01:43:27.066 --> 01:43:28.816
What do you do with a lead brick?

1589
01:43:28.984 --> 01:43:31.402
Place it in the front of the motorcycle.

1590
01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:33.029
And that's your plan?

1591
01:43:33.197 --> 01:43:34.322
Yeah.

1592
01:43:35.824 --> 01:43:37.992
Well, you must get
the center of pressure...

1593
01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.903
behind the center of gravity,
and if you don't get it right...

1594
01:43:40.913 --> 01:43:43.748
then she'll start to fishtail
as soon as you get her wound up.

1595
01:43:43.916 --> 01:43:45.375
What do you mean by fishtail?

1596
01:43:45.542 --> 01:43:49.045
Well, like a fish's behind, you know.
You'll start doing that...

1597
01:43:49.213 --> 01:43:51.733
and that's what happened today
when I had the handling run.

1598
01:43:51.882 --> 01:43:55.843
And so, in a panic, I lifted my head up
from behind the screen...

1599
01:43:56.011 --> 01:43:59.430
and suddenly the bike
started to go straight...

1600
01:43:59.598 --> 01:44:02.392
and I knew somehow that
I'd solved the problem...

1601
01:44:02.559 --> 01:44:05.103
by sticking my head up into the wind.

1602
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:06.813
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

1603
01:44:06.981 --> 01:44:08.501
Well, I'll show you. Let me have that.

1604
01:44:08.649 --> 01:44:11.818
Hey, give me... What are you doing?

1605
01:44:11.986 --> 01:44:16.364
Now, imagine this cigar is my Streamliner.

1606
01:44:16.532 --> 01:44:17.812
You don't poke holes in a cigar.

1607
01:44:17.908 --> 01:44:21.244
Now, if I hold it in the middle
and blow on it like so...

1608
01:44:22.663 --> 01:44:24.914
See how unstable it is?

1609
01:44:25.082 --> 01:44:29.127
- Now, if I shift...
- Not again.

1610
01:44:29.294 --> 01:44:32.255
the center of pressure here,
and blow on it...

1611
01:44:36.927 --> 01:44:40.763
See? It's much more stable.
See, the center of pressure...

1612
01:44:40.931 --> 01:44:42.765
is behind the center of gravity...

1613
01:44:42.933 --> 01:44:45.453
and that's what I'm trying to fix
with the lead brick, see?

1614
01:44:45.519 --> 01:44:47.311
You're quite clever, Burt, you know that?

1615
01:44:47.479 --> 01:44:51.315
Now all I need to do is to test my theory
before I run on the salt...

1616
01:44:51.483 --> 01:44:54.277
and I was thinking of crossing
over the state line...

1617
01:44:54.445 --> 01:44:57.864
from here in Utah into Nevada
where there's no speed limit...

1618
01:44:58.032 --> 01:45:00.700
and running the bike with a lead brick
in the front of it.

1619
01:45:50.459 --> 01:45:52.668
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1620
01:45:52.836 --> 01:45:54.556
You know how fast you were
going back there?

1621
01:45:54.671 --> 01:45:59.217
Yeah. About 150,
160 miles an hour.

1622
01:46:00.594 --> 01:46:03.846
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

1623
01:46:04.014 --> 01:46:06.724
How's he gonna talk his way
out of this one?

1624
01:46:07.684 --> 01:46:10.728
He's sure got his ass in a sling
this time, don't he?

1625
01:46:10.896 --> 01:46:14.357
So, what's the situation with this thing?
You don't have any license plates on it.

1626
01:46:14.525 --> 01:46:17.860
- Well, it's registered in New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

1627
01:46:18.028 --> 01:46:20.863
Yeah. That's where I come from.

1628
01:46:23.659 --> 01:46:26.911
Right. You mean to tell me that
this contraption of yours...

1629
01:46:27.079 --> 01:46:28.454
is registered for the road?

1630
01:46:28.622 --> 01:46:30.581
Yeah, in New Zealand.

1631
01:46:30.749 --> 01:46:32.542
New Zealand. Right.

1632
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:35.753
Well, how about taking it easy
here in Nevada?

1633
01:46:35.921 --> 01:46:37.681
Just because we don't have a speed limit...

1634
01:46:37.798 --> 01:46:39.758
don't mean we want people
killing themselves.

1635
01:46:40.217 --> 01:46:44.053
- Right, sounds fair enough to me.
- All right. You have a good day.

1636
01:46:44.221 --> 01:46:45.721
- I will. Thank you.
- You bet.

1637
01:46:45.889 --> 01:46:47.765
Burt, everything okay?

1638
01:46:48.809 --> 01:46:50.560
Well, fellas...

1639
01:46:50.727 --> 01:46:55.064
we're gonna have to give the lead brick
the old Spanish archer.

1640
01:46:55.232 --> 01:46:58.901
- Spanish archer?
- Yeah, the big elbow, you know?

1641
01:46:59.069 --> 01:47:03.197
The lead brick has got to go.
Whose stupid idea was that, anyway?

1642
01:47:03.365 --> 01:47:04.448
It was yours.

1643
01:47:04.616 --> 01:47:09.745
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna
have to ride her the way she is.

1644
01:47:09.913 --> 01:47:11.581
What about that speed wobble?

1645
01:47:11.748 --> 01:47:15.418
Well, I'll cross that bridge
when I get there.

1646
01:47:15.586 --> 01:47:18.045
- I've got another problem, too.
- Yeah? What now?

1647
01:47:18.213 --> 01:47:22.758
Well, when I get her going,
there's an enormous amount of heat...

1648
01:47:22.926 --> 01:47:28.764
coming off the exhaust pipe,
and I hope it doesn't cook my leg.

1649
01:47:28.932 --> 01:47:31.726
Maybe you could wrap your leg
in some asbestos cloth.

1650
01:47:31.894 --> 01:47:34.437
- That should fix it, shouldn't it?
- Yeah. That's a good idea.

1651
01:47:34.605 --> 01:47:37.273
So you got any more problems
you want to tell us about?

1652
01:47:37.441 --> 01:47:39.442
Oh, yes. My old ticker.

1653
01:47:39.610 --> 01:47:41.360
You got a bad heart?

1654
01:47:41.528 --> 01:47:43.029
Yes, I have.

1655
01:47:45.199 --> 01:47:46.991
- Hey, Burt.
- Yeah?

1656
01:47:47.159 --> 01:47:49.785
- I've got a little surprise for you.
- What?

1657
01:47:49.953 --> 01:47:51.787
Close your eyes and give me your hand.

1658
01:47:51.955 --> 01:47:54.457
- What?
- Just close your eyes. Come on.

1659
01:47:54.625 --> 01:47:57.710
- What for?
- Because I said so, mister. Come on.

1660
01:47:59.838 --> 01:48:01.297
Just keep walking.

1661
01:48:01.465 --> 01:48:04.926
Wendy, you're not gonna make a fool
out of an old man, now.

1662
01:48:05.093 --> 01:48:06.302
I'd never do that.

1663
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:08.471
- No?
- Never.

1664
01:48:08.639 --> 01:48:11.349
Never. Okay. Okay. Now turn around.

1665
01:48:11.516 --> 01:48:13.017
- Yeah?
- All right.

1666
01:48:13.185 --> 01:48:14.977
- All right?
- Now hold your hands out.

1667
01:48:15.145 --> 01:48:16.145
- Yeah?
- Good.

1668
01:48:16.313 --> 01:48:18.147
- Put that in your pocket.
- All right.

1669
01:48:18.315 --> 01:48:20.149
- There you go. Good.
- What are you doing?

1670
01:48:20.317 --> 01:48:23.152
Okay. You can open them.

1671
01:48:37.668 --> 01:48:39.460
What are you all staring at?

1672
01:48:41.797 --> 01:48:42.880
What is this?

1673
01:48:43.048 --> 01:48:45.675
Burt, we've unanimously voted you...

1674
01:48:45.842 --> 01:48:48.001
here on the Salt Flats,
Sportsman of the Year...

1675
01:48:48.011 --> 01:48:51.514
because we figured nobody has ever
traveled as far as you have...

1676
01:48:51.682 --> 01:48:53.182
to be here for Speed Week.

1677
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:57.019
So normally, we would present
a trophy or something like that...

1678
01:48:57.187 --> 01:49:00.773
but considering your case, we thought
a few extra dollars would be appreciated...

1679
01:49:00.941 --> 01:49:02.650
so we passed the hat around.

1680
01:49:06.071 --> 01:49:08.239
Oh, my goodness.

1681
01:49:10.492 --> 01:49:13.035
All I know is...

1682
01:49:13.203 --> 01:49:14.870
Oh!

1683
01:49:25.716 --> 01:49:28.259
Well, thank you all.

1684
01:49:28.427 --> 01:49:31.929
Thank you all very much.

1685
01:49:32.097 --> 01:49:35.433
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

1686
01:49:36.226 --> 01:49:39.270
Oh, dear. It's quite overwhelming,
you know?

1687
01:49:39.438 --> 01:49:42.398
It's 25-years' dream to come here.

1688
01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:49.238
Well, I should try to justify
your respect...

1689
01:49:49.406 --> 01:49:51.949
and, you know...

1690
01:49:52.117 --> 01:49:56.203
the original speed of my old bike
was 54 miles an hour.

1691
01:49:58.915 --> 01:50:03.210
Now today I'm hoping to,
you know, improve it a little.

1692
01:50:30.113 --> 01:50:32.114
Next is Burt Munro...

1693
01:50:32.282 --> 01:50:36.869
all the way from Invercargill, New Zealand.

1694
01:50:37.037 --> 01:50:40.873
Burt Munro's entry was
approved just yesterday.

1695
01:50:47.047 --> 01:50:49.131
Huh? Come on, tighten it up.

1696
01:50:49.299 --> 01:50:51.133
- Burt, where'd you get this stuff?
- What?

1697
01:50:51.301 --> 01:50:54.762
- I said, where'd you get this stuff?
- Oh, I tore an old electric blanket apart...

1698
01:50:54.930 --> 01:50:56.806
and got the asbestos cloth out of it.

1699
01:50:56.973 --> 01:50:59.350
- Got those heart pills?
- You okay?

1700
01:50:59.518 --> 01:51:02.978
- Better take one. Yeah.
- Yeah. They're almost ready.

1701
01:51:03.146 --> 01:51:05.898
Guys, come on, let's go.

1702
01:51:06.066 --> 01:51:10.236
The bottle says that they may cause
drowsiness. Do not operate machinery.

1703
01:51:10.404 --> 01:51:12.988
- I know that.
- You're not supposed to take two of them.

1704
01:51:13.156 --> 01:51:15.741
One for me, one for the old girl.

1705
01:51:15.909 --> 01:51:19.203
Nitroglycerine. Make it go faster.

1706
01:51:19.371 --> 01:51:21.163
Have some of this, love.

1707
01:51:25.252 --> 01:51:26.836
There you go.

1708
01:51:32.801 --> 01:51:33.884
Yeah. We're almost there.

1709
01:51:34.052 --> 01:51:36.512
All right. Here we go.
Oh, let's do it.

1710
01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:37.805
- Your goggles, huh?
- What?

1711
01:51:37.973 --> 01:51:41.016
- Your goggles. Put your goggles on.
- Calm down. For goodness' sake.

1712
01:51:43.812 --> 01:51:45.020
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

1713
01:51:45.981 --> 01:51:49.775
I can't get my leg in because
of the asbestos cloth on it.

1714
01:51:50.986 --> 01:51:52.486
Okay.

1715
01:51:56.533 --> 01:51:58.742
Let me take it off.

1716
01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:02.788
- Well, what about your leg and the heat?
- Screw it. I've got a spare one.

1717
01:52:04.374 --> 01:52:06.584
- All right, Burt.
- Yeah?

1718
01:52:06.751 --> 01:52:08.210
Get those goggles on.

1719
01:52:08.378 --> 01:52:09.879
- You all right?
- Fine.

1720
01:52:10.046 --> 01:52:12.548
All right. You know the way.
Make sure you come back.

1721
01:52:12.716 --> 01:52:13.883
Come on, let's go!

1722
01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:16.552
All right, push!

1723
01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:18.554
All right! Come on, fellas, push faster!

1724
01:52:18.722 --> 01:52:20.389
All right, Burt!

1725
01:52:20.557 --> 01:52:21.807
Keep running!

1726
01:52:23.059 --> 01:52:24.894
Good luck!

1727
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:27.021
Keep it straight, okay?

1728
01:52:28.273 --> 01:52:31.066
There you go, Burt!
Come on, go!

1729
01:52:31.234 --> 01:52:33.152
Let's go, Burt!

1730
01:52:36.156 --> 01:52:37.531
Woo-hoo!

1731
01:52:37.699 --> 01:52:39.533
Come on, Burt!

1732
01:52:39.701 --> 01:52:41.869
You can do it, Burt!

1733
01:52:42.037 --> 01:52:44.121
He's got no parachute
and he's got no brakes.

1734
01:53:02.974 --> 01:53:05.434
158.647.

1735
01:53:05.602 --> 01:53:09.438
Mile 1: 158.647 miles per hour.

1736
01:53:09.606 --> 01:53:10.689
Go, Burt!

1737
01:53:10.857 --> 01:53:13.234
- Come on!
- Go, Burt!

1738
01:53:13.401 --> 01:53:15.611
- Make us proud, honey!
- Burt!

1739
01:53:30.627 --> 01:53:32.711
167.921.

1740
01:53:32.879 --> 01:53:36.173
Mile 2: 167.921 miles per hour.

1741
01:53:36.341 --> 01:53:39.051
Crank it, Burt.
Come on. Go, go, go!

1742
01:53:39.219 --> 01:53:40.469
Come on, Burt!

1743
01:53:50.313 --> 01:53:54.358
Mile 3: 170.371 miles per hour.

1744
01:53:54.526 --> 01:53:56.068
Come on, come on, come on.

1745
01:54:07.455 --> 01:54:10.082
Mile 4: 172.485 miles per hour.

1746
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:11.333
Go!

1747
01:54:11.501 --> 01:54:13.836
- Come on, Burt!
- That's the one! Come on, Burt!

1748
01:54:14.004 --> 01:54:15.462
Burt!

1749
01:54:15.630 --> 01:54:18.465
Mile 5: 183.694 miles per hour.

1750
01:54:37.819 --> 01:54:40.029
193.728.

1751
01:54:40.196 --> 01:54:43.365
Mile 6: 193.728 miles per hour.

1752
01:54:51.583 --> 01:54:53.626
Come on, Burt! You can do it!
Come on, Burt!

1753
01:54:53.793 --> 01:54:55.377
Come on, Burt!

1754
01:54:55.545 --> 01:54:58.922
Mile 7: 194.211 miles per hour.

1755
01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:02.968
- Come on, Burt!
- Holy moly! Come on!

1756
01:55:46.846 --> 01:55:48.013
What is it?

1757
01:55:48.181 --> 01:55:50.599
201 .851.

1758
01:55:50.767 --> 01:55:55.604
Mile 8: 201 .851 miles per hour.

1759
01:56:03.113 --> 01:56:05.739
Ladies and gentlemen, a new record...

1760
01:56:05.907 --> 01:56:10.494
201 .851 miles per hour.

1761
01:56:12.956 --> 01:56:15.040
Burt, I hope you're gonna stop soon.

1762
01:56:15.208 --> 01:56:18.001
- He's going back! Back.
- Back where?

1763
01:56:18.169 --> 01:56:19.769
Back to whatever planet he came from...

1764
01:56:19.879 --> 01:56:22.798
because he sure as hell
ain't from this one!

1765
01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:18.020
I really did toast my leg.

1766
01:57:23.651 --> 01:57:27.696
I did it. I did it.

1767
01:57:57.018 --> 01:58:00.938
Tom, can you get that?
My hands are wet.

1768
01:58:04.818 --> 01:58:06.109
Hello.

1769
01:58:06.277 --> 01:58:07.986
This is the United States calling.

1770
01:58:08.154 --> 01:58:11.240
I have a collect call from Mr. Burt Munro.
Will you accept the charge?

1771
01:58:11.407 --> 01:58:13.075
Mom, it's Burt calling collect!

1772
01:58:13.243 --> 01:58:15.536
It is? Accept the call.
Accept the call.

1773
01:58:15.703 --> 01:58:18.580
- My mom said we can accept the call.
- Go ahead, sir.

1774
01:58:18.748 --> 01:58:20.290
Hello, Tom, is that you?

1775
01:58:20.458 --> 01:58:24.086
- Yes.
- It's me, Burt. I did it, Tom.

1776
01:58:24.254 --> 01:58:27.881
- She's the world's fastest Indian!
- She is?

1777
01:58:28.049 --> 01:58:32.427
Dad. Dad. He did it. Burt did it.

1778
01:58:32.595 --> 01:58:34.429
He set a new record.

1779
01:58:49.404 --> 01:58:51.280
- Hi!
- Hey!

1780
01:58:51.447 --> 01:58:53.657
- How are you?
- Hey!

1781
01:58:53.825 --> 01:58:54.825
You did it!

1782
01:58:54.993 --> 01:58:57.619
Hi, Franklin. Jeff, thanks a lot, mate.

1783
01:58:57.787 --> 01:59:00.372
- Welcome home, Burt.
- Hello, George.

1784
01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:03.625
Oh, my goodness, you've made
this space look spiffy, mate.

1785
01:59:03.793 --> 01:59:05.127
- You done us proud!
- Yeah!

1786
01:59:05.295 --> 01:59:06.628
You put Invercargill on the map.

1787
01:59:06.796 --> 01:59:09.923
- Well, I reckon so, yeah.
- So, what have you got planned now?

1788
01:59:10.091 --> 01:59:12.011
Well, right now I've got
a lot of work to do...

1789
01:59:12.135 --> 01:59:14.511
if I'm to get back to Bonneville
next year, you know?

1790
01:59:14.679 --> 01:59:16.805
So more early mornings, then.

1791
01:59:16.973 --> 01:59:19.975
Yeah. More early mornings.
Hello, love.

1792
01:59:20.143 --> 01:59:23.395
- Welcome home.
- Nice to be back.

1793
01:59:23.563 --> 01:59:25.731
- Hello, Tom.
- Hi, Burt.

1794
01:59:25.899 --> 01:59:29.067
How are you, son?
Good to see you.

1795
01:59:29.235 --> 01:59:30.485
You're growing up a bit, huh?

1796
01:59:31.821 --> 01:59:33.780
I looked after your lemon tree,
like you told me.

1797
01:59:33.948 --> 01:59:36.825
You did, yeah. It's looking good too.

1798
01:59:36.993 --> 01:59:39.202
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1799
01:59:39.370 --> 01:59:41.663
- I fed the chickens.
- You did?

1800
01:59:41.831 --> 01:59:44.666
- And Mom cooked all the eggs.
- Oh, yeah? They taste good?

1801
01:59:44.834 --> 01:59:46.668
- Yep.
- Yeah. Hey, have you got the key?

1802
01:59:46.836 --> 01:59:48.670
- Here it is.
- All right, thanks.

1803
01:59:48.838 --> 01:59:50.797
- I took care of it.
- I knew you would.

1804
01:59:50.965 --> 01:59:53.508
- How fast did you go?
- Oh, mighty fast.

1805
01:59:53.676 --> 01:59:55.761
On one of my runs,
I did over 200 miles an hour.

1806
01:59:55.929 --> 01:59:59.097
Whoa! What would happen if you
opened your mouth at that speed?

1807
01:59:59.265 --> 02:00:01.975
Well, you'd blow the backside
out of your pants, I reckon.

1808
02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.188
All right. Let's see.

1809
02:00:06.356 --> 02:00:11.526
Ah! Nice to be home,
back in my shed.
