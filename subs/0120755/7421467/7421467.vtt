00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:40.624
<i>Nekhorvichi well, Dmitri.</i>

2
00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.168
<i>Every search for a hero</i>

3
00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:46.838
<i>must begin with something
that every hero requires,</i>

4
00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.299
a <i>villain.</i>

5
00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:54.888
<i>Therefore
in a search for our hero, bellerophon</i>

6
00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.932
<i>we created a monster</i>

7
00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.019
<i>chimera.</i>

8
00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.193
<i>I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney</i>

9
00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:10.988
<i>and accompany me
to Atlanta immediately.</i>

10
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.656
<i>However we travel,</i>

11
00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:16.910
<i>I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.</i>

12
00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:32.092
Ring around the Rosie

13
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.886
a pocket full of posies

14
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.889
ashes, ashes

15
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.517
we all fall down

16
00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:51.528
<i>folks,
we're two and a half hours from Atlanta.</i>

17
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.365
<i>Look out your window now. We have
a great view of the rocky mountains.</i>

18
00:01:56.617 --> 00:02:00.871
You keep staring at that watch
as if your life depended on it, doctor.

19
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.040
Well, yes.

20
00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.584
I suppose I'm a bit anxious.

21
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.128
You'll soon be with old friends.

22
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.922
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

23
00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.093
I'm sorry it couldn't be
under happier circumstances.

24
00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:16.553
I'm sorry too.

25
00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.181
You are sorry, and I am sorry.

26
00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:25.896
You don't know gradski thought the
world of you.

27
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.356
Did he

28
00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:29.483
know

29
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:32.402
before the end
that you two had succeeded?

30
00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:34.821
Yes, he knew. Just.

31
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.783
Not in time to save him?

32
00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:39.409
No.

33
00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:43.580
After you've been infected with chimera
for 20 hours

34
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.415
nothing can save you

35
00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.626
not even bellerophon.

36
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.921
You can carry them together

37
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.715
safely?

38
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:54.841
Yes.

39
00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.846
And you'll get us to safe place with them
in Atlanta, thank god.

40
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.599
<i>This is your captain again.</i>

41
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:06.269
<i>We've experienced a slight
but abrupt drop in cabin pressure.</i>

42
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.064
As a precaution,
I've released the oxygen masks.

43
00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:12.275
<i>Please put them on, sit back, relax.</i>

44
00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.611
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

45
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.949
Are you concerned?

46
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.243
Not so far.

47
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.120
Just put on your oxygen mask.

48
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.497
- I'll see what's going on.
- Okay.

49
00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.925
Denver center,
this is transpac 2207, 747 heavy.

50
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.095
We're unable to maintain cabin
pressurization.

51
00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:43.473
We've initiated a descent to 1-6000.

52
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.934
Captain...

53
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:14.838
God.

54
00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.352
It seems we have a problem, Dmitri.

55
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.730
You keep calling me Dmitri.

56
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.816
You really shouldn't.

57
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.402
You are not Dmitri?

58
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:51.833
No.

59
00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.253
Wallis,

60
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.255
hold on to this.

61
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.393
Ulrich, remember to pull the...

62
00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.274
Remember to pull the n02 tank
and dump it.

63
00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.984
All done, chief.

64
00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.989
<i>Terrain. Terrain.</i>

65
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:26.409
<i>Pull up. Pull up. Terrain.</i>

66
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.415
Seven nine nine!

67
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.460
<i>Checkpoint Charlie, three, two, one!</i>

68
00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.003
Go!

69
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.846
<i>Terrain. Terrain.</i>

70
00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.639
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

71
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.599
<i>Terrain. Terrain.</i>

72
00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.977
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

73
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.850
<i>Good morning, Mr. hunt.</i>

74
00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.810
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it</i>

75
00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.063
<i>involves the recovery of a stolen item</i>

76
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.939
<i>designated chimera.</i>

77
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.609
<i>You may select any two team members
but it is essential</i>

78
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.154
<i>that the third team
member be nyah nordoff-hall.</i>

79
00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.822
<i>She is a civilian</i>

80
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.366
<i>and a highly capable professional thief.</i>

81
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.119
<i>You have 48 hours
to recruit miss nordoff-hall</i>

82
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.914
<i>and meet me in Seville
to receive your assignment.</i>

83
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.501
<i>As always, should you or any member
of your imf team be caught or killed</i>

84
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.171
<i>the secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.</i>

85
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.924
<i>And, Mr. hunt,
the next time you go on holiday</i>

86
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:54.094
<i>please let us know where you're going.</i>

87
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.845
<i>This message will self-destruct</i>

88
00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.222
<i>in five seconds.</i>

89
00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.682
If I let you know where I'm going

90
00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.519
then I won't be on holiday.

91
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.485
I see you found it.

92
00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.407
What are you doing here?

93
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.076
Think you're the only one
who can pick a lock?

94
00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.497
Not just a pretty face after all.

95
00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.559
Do you mind if I'm on top?

96
00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.937
Either way works for me.

97
00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:42.340
- You'll never find it there.
- Damn it.

98
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.053
- Find what?
- His ex's bulgari necklace.

99
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.555
It goes up for auction on Tuesday.

100
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.854
And are you going to tell me where it is?

101
00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:00.316
Far left.

102
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.747
This is very disconcerting.

103
00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:18.501
Hey, you put me here.
I just do as I'm told.

104
00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:20.670
Right.

105
00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:47.905
Now

106
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:52.034
who are you
and what's it gonna cost me?

107
00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.162
I wouldn't do that.

108
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.496
What?

109
00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.291
That.

110
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.802
Mr. keys, it is you.

111
00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:13.014
It is Mr. keys, our security engineer.
Apologize!

112
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:15.057
No, no need to apologize.

113
00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:18.895
Miss hall, my associate,
has your necklace in a very safe place

114
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.607
but obviously we do feel the alarm
should have gone off a little sooner.

115
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.650
Isn't that right, miss hall?

116
00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:28.279
Oh, absolutely.
Much, much too long, I'd say.

117
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:35.786
We'd recommend resetting the sensors
to respond to a lighter load.

118
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.789
How do you feel about 40 kilos,
miss hall?

119
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.249
Perfect.

120
00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.711
Shall we?

121
00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:48.549
Miss hall,

122
00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.220
haven't you forgotten something?

123
00:16:56.766 --> 00:17:00.436
What are you trying to do, senorita,
rob me?

124
00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.939
The thought had crossed my mind.

125
00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.234
I'm missing something here,

126
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.194
aside from my
half million pound necklace.

127
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:10.738
Even after I screwed up the job, i
could have walked out with the thing.

128
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.989
At least you walked.

129
00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.742
If you weren't going to let me get away
with it, why did you watch me do it?

130
00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.202
I wanted to see how good you were.

131
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:18.788
I was hoping we might work together.

132
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.456
Sounds terrific.

133
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.129
Now be serious.
Whatever you're talking about,

134
00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.965
you couldn't want me
after that performance.

135
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:32.426
- You didn't do that badly.
- You apologizing for me?

136
00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.762
Quite the gentleman.

137
00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.389
Not really.

138
00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.433
I triggered the alarm.

139
00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:44.355
Sorry.

140
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:51.279
I don't do laundry, cook

141
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.990
or put up with cheeky bastards
who set me up on their territory

142
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.825
so they can poach on mine.

143
00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:22.393
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

144
00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.021
Would you mind slowing down?

145
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.610
Where did you get this number?
I don't even have it.

146
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.988
Would you like it?

147
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:55.885
Pull over and listen to me, will you?
Just listen.

148
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.721
- Listen to what?
- I need your help.

149
00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.891
- I think you could use mine.
- Your help?

150
00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.392
What are you talking about?

151
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:06.270
I'm talking about Scotland yard, interpol

152
00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.314
every Dutch authority.

153
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.067
I can make them all go away.

154
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.735
Oh, bloody hell.

155
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.320
You're a spy!

156
00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.615
Well, if you want me,
you've gotta catch me.

157
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.430
You having fun?

158
00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:55.736
Sorry.

159
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:04.745
Sorry.

160
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.498
Watch the road.

161
00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:13.522
What's your name?

162
00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.650
Ethan hunt.

163
00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:19.403
Well, Ethan hunt

164
00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.908
what is it you want to talk to me about?

165
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:26.911
A lot more than I thought.

166
00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:32.458
Awfully short notice.

167
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.544
Care to wait a decent interval?

168
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.088
Who wants to be decent?

169
00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:38.107
So what have you got against spies?

170
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:41.235
When they've got
your recruiting technique

171
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:42.778
nothing.

172
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.825
- This wasn't exactly by the book.
- They've got a book for this?

173
00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:50.327
They've got a book for everything.

174
00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:53.998
So this thing these blokes pinched...

175
00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.709
I don't know that they pinched it.

176
00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:59.628
I don't even know that they're blokes.

177
00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:03.173
What am I doing here?

178
00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:09.346
I thought I was supposed to be
some kind of thief to catch a thief.

179
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.140
So did I.

180
00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:13.809
Sort of.

181
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.485
Damn, you're beautiful.

182
00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:39.770
Espresso? Cappuccino?

183
00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:41.313
No, thanks.

184
00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:43.399
Sit down.

185
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.235
Festival's a pain in the ass.

186
00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:48.654
Honoring their saints
by setting them on fire.

187
00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:51.073
Lets you know what they think of
saints, doesn't it?

188
00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:54.076
Damn near set me on fire
on my way over here.

189
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.747
Sorry, I barged in on your vacation.

190
00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:02.918
- Sorry I didn't tell you where I was.
- Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.

191
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.421
Well, you're sorry, and I'm sorry.

192
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:10.884
- Why did you phrase it like that?
- Like what?

193
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.220
"You're sorry. I'm sorry."

194
00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:16.265
You gotta be kidding.

195
00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:25.107
<i>Nekhorvichi well, Dmitri</i>

196
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:27.735
<i>once again I need your help</i>

197
00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:29.987
<i>just as in the old days, huh?</i>

198
00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:34.158
<i>When you saved our lives,
saved our very sanity.</i>

199
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:36.785
<i>Dmitri...</i>

200
00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:41.290
<i>We have this little problem.</i>

201
00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.835
<i>Every search for a hero</i>

202
00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:48.797
<i>must begin with something
that every hero requires,</i>

203
00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:50.174
a <i>villain.</i>

204
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:55.304
<i>Therefore
in a search for our hero, bellerophon</i>

205
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.140
<i>we created a monster</i>

206
00:25:58.682 --> 00:25:59.933
<i>chimera.</i>

207
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:04.146
<i>I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney</i>

208
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:07.691
<i>and accompany me to
Atlanta immediately.</i>

209
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.818
<i>However we travel,</i>

210
00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:14.490
<i>I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.</i>

211
00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:19.661
<i>I fear I can entrust this
to no one but you.</i>

212
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:21.330
<i>Dmitri...</i>

213
00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:26.126
<i>As we say, I'm sorry, and you are sorry.</i>

214
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.921
Do you have any idea what the hell
he's talking about?

215
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:30.589
An idea? Yeah.

216
00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:33.675
- Like?
-Lt's a good idea to get him now.

217
00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:38.180
A bad idea to fly him on a commercial
carrier. Ls he still in Sydney?

218
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.016
Dr. Vladimir nekhorvich is dead.

219
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:46.188
So is his colleague gradski,
but that happened earlier.

220
00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:48.690
We had nekhorvich on a flight
from Sydney

221
00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:50.901
that crashed in the rockies.

222
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.444
Dead.

223
00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:54.696
Are you listening to me?

224
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.118
If he didn't want to go anywhere
without me

225
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.538
how did you get him on that flight?

226
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:04.123
You were there.

227
00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:14.216
When I couldn't find you,
i had to replace you.

228
00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:16.593
Sean ambrose was the obvious choice.

229
00:27:16.677 --> 00:27:19.096
He doubled you two or three times.

230
00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:24.059
- Twice.
- What did you think of him?

231
00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:31.650
We had reservations about each other.
It's a bit late to be asking me that.

232
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:33.402
No, not necessarily.

233
00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:34.987
Airline records

234
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:39.783
list a captain Harold macintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.

235
00:27:40.284 --> 00:27:43.745
As far as the media and all the
governmental agencies are concerned

236
00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:46.415
captain macintosh died in the flight.

237
00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.458
But, in fact, he missed it.

238
00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:51.628
He did, however, make the next flight

239
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.172
in cargo

240
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:57.593
stuffed into a rather small suitcase,
considering his size.

241
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.221
Someone on that flight
planned an operation

242
00:28:01.263 --> 00:28:03.515
designed to bring the plane down and
make it look like an accident.

243
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:06.727
Someone skillful enough
to bring it off without a hitch.

244
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.315
There's one thing we know
that ambrose doesn't.

245
00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:14.860
Then you do think it was ambrose?
You're not surprised?

246
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.820
Sean feels he hasn't done the job

247
00:28:16.904 --> 00:28:18.822
unless he leaves a lot of hats
on the ground.

248
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:20.449
The question is why.

249
00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:23.535
What was this chimera
nekhorvich was carrying?

250
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.496
Only ambrose knows that.

251
00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:30.792
In any case,
you must recover this chimera

252
00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:32.628
and bring it to us.

253
00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:37.257
In order to do that, I've got to figure
out how he plans to make money on it.

254
00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:39.426
That is where miss hall comes in.

255
00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.474
Excuse me?

256
00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.227
Miss hall and ambrose
had a relationship

257
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.561
which he took very seriously.

258
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:52.648
She walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.

259
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.984
We believe she's our surest and
quickest way of locating him.

260
00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:57.527
And then what?

261
00:28:58.362 --> 00:29:00.447
Well, make sure
she continues to see him

262
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:03.492
gets him to confide in her,
and report to you.

263
00:29:18.298 --> 00:29:20.968
You made it sound as if
i was recruiting her

264
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:23.053
for her skills as a thief.

265
00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:27.266
Well, then I mislead you
or you made the wrong assumption.

266
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:31.019
Either way, we are asking her
to resume a prior relationship

267
00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:33.438
not do anything she hasn't already done.

268
00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:35.524
Voluntarily, I might add.

269
00:29:38.068 --> 00:29:41.280
No, she's got no training
for this kind of thing.

270
00:29:41.863 --> 00:29:43.323
To go to bed with a man and lie to him?

271
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:46.285
She's a woman.
She's got all the training she needs.

272
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:54.876
I don't think I can get her to do it.

273
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:57.045
- You mean it'll be difficult.
- Very.

274
00:29:57.129 --> 00:30:00.507
Well, this is not mission: Difficult,
Mr. hunt. It's mission: Impossible.

275
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:02.467
Difficult should be
a walk in the park for you.

276
00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:04.052
I'm open to suggestion.

277
00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:06.054
If you can think of a quicker way
to get to ambrose

278
00:30:06.096 --> 00:30:07.306
you're welcome to try.

279
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:08.724
You might want to take a look at these

280
00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:12.269
if you have any further qualms about
getting her to do the job.

281
00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:13.955
How many people are capable
of something like that?

282
00:31:17.918 --> 00:31:19.461
Sean ambrose

283
00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:21.088
for one.

284
00:31:27.803 --> 00:31:28.970
Right.

285
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:42.275
This wasn't what I had in mind, nyah.

286
00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:48.990
But it is what you'd like me to do.

287
00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:54.371
What?

288
00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:57.332
Oh, let my conscience be my guide.
Ls that it?

289
00:31:57.416 --> 00:31:58.500
Something like that.

290
00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:01.211
I don't have a conscience.
I'm a bloody thief.

291
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:07.843
You're gonna try and force me
to do this?

292
00:32:07.884 --> 00:32:09.928
Generally, I don't favor
coercing someone

293
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:13.432
not when there's a chance
my life could end up in their hands.

294
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.600
Is that the only reason?

295
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:18.311
- Can you think of a better one?
- Me? No.

296
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:21.022
I was hoping you might, thinking that
somewhere in the course of business

297
00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:23.316
this got personal as well as physical!

298
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:26.361
Okay. Would it make you feel any better
if I didn't want you to do this?

299
00:32:26.445 --> 00:32:28.697
- Yeah, much.
- Then feel better!

300
00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:09.362
Sean will never be anything
but suspicious if I pitch up

301
00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:11.740
saying, "hey, honey, I'm home."

302
00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:15.202
What wouldn't make him suspicious?

303
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:17.871
That I needed him in some urgent way.

304
00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:21.208
Destitute,

305
00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:23.001
in serious trouble,

306
00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:26.004
the kind
i couldn't possibly sort out myself.

307
00:33:26.922 --> 00:33:28.757
Serious trouble, nyah

308
00:33:29.716 --> 00:33:32.135
is something I can always arrange.

309
00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:39.392
<i>This transponder chip
is completely untraceable.</i>

310
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.605
<i>It transmits your location to a satellite</i>

311
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:46.525
<i>which can be read
by only this computer.</i>

312
00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:49.778
<i>We can then track you
to within three feet</i>

313
00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:50.946
<i>anywhere.</i>

314
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:55.617
<i>Since your arrest,
I've been sending news bulletins</i>

315
00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:58.495
<i>to every law enforcement agency
in the world.</i>

316
00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.288
<i>I know Sean ambrose</i>

317
00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.875
<i>and I guarantee
that after that airline crash</i>

318
00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:06.628
<i>he's monitoring every one of them.</i>

319
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.797
<i>He knows you're there.</i>

320
00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:12.968
<i>And he has the means to get you out.</i>

321
00:34:15.637 --> 00:34:16.638
<i>Nyah.</i>

322
00:34:19.975 --> 00:34:20.976
<i>Nyah...</i>

323
00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:24.688
<i>I'm not gonna lose you.</i>

324
00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:24.873
Agent hunt?

325
00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.916
Good day, mate.
I'm William baird, but Billy's okay.

326
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.461
Anything you need me to get,
move or watch, I'm your man.

327
00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:31.212
I'll have a look around.

328
00:35:36.009 --> 00:35:37.093
Luther; Shit.

329
00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:38.553
Yes, it is.

330
00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:42.223
This ain't funny.

331
00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.935
I just bought these $800 Gucci shoes

332
00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:48.938
and you got me in a helicopter
with this man?

333
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.809
Computer's up. We got her.

334
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:29.562
Let's put in the coordinates
and get a visual.

335
00:36:56.297 --> 00:37:00.176
- Visuals aren't coming up.
- Satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.

336
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.554
Yeah, I heard about you, Luther.

337
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:06.975
I wanna say it's an honor and a
pleasure to be working with you blokes.

338
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.481
Isn't there any way
we can speed this up?

339
00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:17.026
With what? This is the only computer
that will do this.

340
00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:17.212
Ethan, here we go.

341
00:38:28.014 --> 00:38:31.518
Now there's a bloke who knows
how to give a proper welcome.

342
00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:36.648
Don't get me wrong, mate.
You were very friendly also.

343
00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:39.526
Ls it him then?

344
00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:41.444
-It's him, Billy.
- So we got him.

345
00:38:41.528 --> 00:38:43.404
We don't know what we've got.

346
00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:45.573
'Cause we don't know what he's got

347
00:38:45.615 --> 00:38:48.868
where he's got it
or what he's doing in Sydney with it.

348
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:57.919
Not much luggage.

349
00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.213
I left in a bit of a hurry.

350
00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:02.757
I'm incredibly grateful, Sean.

351
00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:06.177
How in the world did you find me?

352
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:10.139
How I usually find you.

353
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:12.767
Magic.

354
00:39:31.828 --> 00:39:33.204
No flies on her.

355
00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:37.417
No bugs either. No transmissions.
She's clean.

356
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:39.919
All cats are.

357
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:49.304
Your room?

358
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.268
And my room?

359
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.912
She did it.

360
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:16.497
She's in the compound.

361
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.499
Yeah?

362
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:23.171
We've just rolled up a snowball
and tossed it into hell.

363
00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:26.257
Now we'll see what chance it has.

364
00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:29.552
Try it on.

365
00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:34.766
Go ahead.

366
00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:44.859
I'm dying to see
if I remembered your size.

367
00:41:14.389 --> 00:41:17.308
You're not interested
in seeing how it looks?

368
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.602
Oh, lam.

369
00:41:22.897 --> 00:41:24.065
Later.

370
00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.008
<i>Every search for a hero</i>

371
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:53.428
<i>must begin with something
that every hero requires,</i>

372
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:54.846
a <i>villain.</i>

373
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.642
<i>Therefore
in a search for our hero, bellerophon</i>

374
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:02.603
<i>we created a monster</i>

375
00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:04.230
<i>chimera.</i>

376
00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:06.482
Nekhorvich was a molecular biologist.

377
00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:09.402
Why is he going on
about an old Greek myth?

378
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.822
Nekhorvich specialized in
recombining DNA molecules.

379
00:42:14.657 --> 00:42:16.034
In the myth

380
00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:19.495
bellerophon was a prince
who killed the chimera,

381
00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:23.249
a monster with the head of a lion

382
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:26.377
and the tail of a serpent

383
00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.464
who plagued the ancient world.

384
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.968
I think nekhorvich created
a monster virus in chimera

385
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:36.804
and the antivirus to kill it

386
00:42:36.846 --> 00:42:38.639
in bellerophon.

387
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:41.726
That simple, huh?

388
00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:45.313
Why not?

389
00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:05.833
Thirty-seven million pounds.

390
00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:10.004
Well, that's a promising bid
for nekhorvich's work.

391
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:15.676
Don't look so worried, Hugh.
We're halfway there.

392
00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:21.265
We'll need this at the track

393
00:43:22.892 --> 00:43:25.186
if we're going to get the other half.

394
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:35.988
Well, then...

395
00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:39.033
Sorted.

396
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:47.125
Not everything.

397
00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.712
Why do you think she's really here?

398
00:43:54.215 --> 00:43:56.217
From her point of view or mine?

399
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:58.719
She wasn't exactly gagging for it

400
00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:01.222
when she left you six months ago.

401
00:44:04.183 --> 00:44:06.727
The question is, "do you trust her?"

402
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:17.363
One considers her timing, of course.

403
00:44:17.405 --> 00:44:20.491
Getting nicked within a week
of the plane going down.

404
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:21.909
Suggestive

405
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:24.829
even borderline suspicious

406
00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:27.790
but hardly conclusive.

407
00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:36.465
You've thought about it at any rate.

408
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:42.972
Tell me, Hugh.

409
00:44:43.764 --> 00:44:48.019
You don't exactly hang on
nyah's every word and gesture, do you?

410
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:53.608
That's a fairly ratty nail.

411
00:44:59.238 --> 00:45:00.448
Please.

412
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:04.619
Suppose she is some sort of trojan
horse sent in by imf

413
00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.995
to spy on us?

414
00:45:06.078 --> 00:45:09.832
Why should I deny myself the pleasure
of a ride or two?

415
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:14.921
Or don't you think I can learn more
from her than she can from me?

416
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:18.007
I do! I do! I do!

417
00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:22.762
Now, Hugh, you must realize

418
00:45:22.887 --> 00:45:26.515
that some of us
have the burden of sex to deal with.

419
00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.977
And I may or may not know
why she thinks she's here

420
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:32.146
but I'm willing to take the risk

421
00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:33.814
because, Hugh

422
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.985
I am gagging for it.

423
00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:04.053
Come on! Come on!

424
00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:08.641
Darling, you won!

425
00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:10.393
I suppose I did.

426
00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:12.436
What made you pick that nag?

427
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.522
She's never won a bloody thing.

428
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:15.773
"Thief in the night."

429
00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:18.526
Say no more.

430
00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:23.406
I'm off to grab a drink.

431
00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:25.700
- You still favor the bellinis?
- Hmm.

432
00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:44.427
Naturally vain.

433
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:47.596
Pardon me?

434
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.223
Naturally vain?

435
00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:54.103
In the fourth. Check her out. She's due.

436
00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:10.786
<i>You can speak
as if I'm right by your side.</i>

437
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.039
Where are you?

438
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.791
<i>Mounting enclosure,
just off the track, 2:00.</i>

439
00:47:31.098 --> 00:47:32.641
How's it going?

440
00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:35.353
Just like old times.

441
00:47:37.104 --> 00:47:38.856
Just like old times?

442
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:41.233
Just about.

443
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:46.864
Tell me who you've run into
at ambrose's.

444
00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:51.660
Near as I can tell, there's about a
half dozen blokes about the place.

445
00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:52.995
<i>Maybe more.</i>

446
00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:55.122
Hugh stamp. Old friend of Sean's.

447
00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:57.291
He's the only one I recognize.

448
00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:59.210
A creep and then some.

449
00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:03.047
We know him. He's over your
left shoulder looking at you right now.

450
00:48:04.799 --> 00:48:08.636
Ambrose has photos of newspapers
with money piled on them.

451
00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:11.097
<i>Thirty-seven million
on the London times.</i>

452
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:12.807
What's that about?

453
00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:16.894
Bids from possible chimera buyers.

454
00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:30.533
Ambrose is meeting some bloke
in the bar.

455
00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:34.286
<i>Big bloke. Ginger hair.
They're into something.</i>

456
00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:43.504
- Who is this guy?
- Checking now, Ethan.

457
00:48:50.845 --> 00:48:54.265
John mccloy,
ceo biocyte pharmaceuticals,

458
00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:57.351
<i>1989, acquired biocyte
in a hostile takeover.</i>

459
00:48:59.979 --> 00:49:02.106
- He was nekhorvich's boss.
- Right.

460
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:05.234
<i>He worked for him
as the research scientist at biocyte.</i>

461
00:49:06.569 --> 00:49:09.864
<i>Ambrose is showing something
to mccloy on a digital camera.</i>

462
00:49:10.573 --> 00:49:14.034
Whatever mccloy's looking at,
he's not happy about it.

463
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.964
<i>Ambrose just pulled the camera's
memory card</i>

464
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:28.883
<i>and put it into an envelope.</i>

465
00:49:30.843 --> 00:49:33.053
<i>Put it in his inner left jacket pocket.</i>

466
00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:35.222
<i>Confirm left jacket pocket.</i>

467
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:37.933
Roger that.

468
00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:41.854
Nyah,

469
00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:44.482
<i>ambrose is on his way back to you.</i>

470
00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:47.860
- There's an envelope inside...
- His left jacket pocket.

471
00:49:48.569 --> 00:49:49.862
That's right.

472
00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:51.197
Where do I meet you?

473
00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:53.574
<i>Betting table 12, off the paddock.</i>

474
00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:57.077
- Are you sure you're up to this?
- I'll muddle through.

475
00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:00.915
- There you are.
- See anything you like?

476
00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:02.917
Well, yeah.

477
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.668
Naturally vain.

478
00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:06.253
But they're about to close the betting

479
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.380
-and I haven't a bean.
- Nyah!

480
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:11.342
- Would you mind terribly?
- Not at all.

481
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:14.094
But you are gonna pay for it

482
00:50:14.637 --> 00:50:16.305
and with interest.

483
00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:18.599
I have no doubt.

484
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:21.143
Hold on.

485
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.117
Put down a thousand for me.

486
00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:43.666
- To win?
- What else?

487
00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:49.004
Billy, make sure nyah's not followed.

488
00:50:49.088 --> 00:50:50.798
No worries, mate.

489
00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:53.676
Luther, digital camera,
ready to transmit.

490
00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:55.219
<i>Betting table 12.</i>

491
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.236
- There you go.
- Thanks.

492
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.157
Sorry about that, mate.
That must have...

493
00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:19.618
Say again?

494
00:51:20.786 --> 00:51:23.914
Whatever you're about,
in future watch your step.

495
00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:26.709
Never know who you might run into.

496
00:51:28.294 --> 00:51:29.962
Where's the loo?

497
00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:32.756
Thanks, mate.

498
00:51:56.697 --> 00:51:58.198
How'd you do?

499
00:51:58.657 --> 00:52:00.326
Don't turn around.

500
00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:02.703
I managed.

501
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:10.586
You turned around.

502
00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:13.714
What are you gonna do, spank me?

503
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.492
I'm booted up. Go, Ethan.

504
00:52:48.624 --> 00:52:50.167
Are you getting this?

505
00:53:01.428 --> 00:53:03.597
"Sergei gradski

506
00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:07.101
"20 hours after exposure."

507
00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:47.307
God.

508
00:53:56.108 --> 00:53:57.568
Stamp's out of the loo.

509
00:53:57.651 --> 00:54:00.654
<i>He's coming out of the tunnel
heading your way, mate.</i>

510
00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:03.323
- I want you out of ambrose's place.
- What are you talking about?

511
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.659
What's happened? What did you see?

512
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.207
<i>Okay, he's coming up
behind you, Ethan.</i>

513
00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:15.627
You've done your job.
I want you out of Australia.

514
00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:18.255
- Thirty steps.
- How do you suggest I go about it?

515
00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:20.007
- Twenty, nineteen...
- He's touched your heart,

516
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.675
you're overwhelmed
and need to think it over.

517
00:54:21.759 --> 00:54:23.552
Fifteen, fourteen.

518
00:54:23.635 --> 00:54:25.512
- Twelve, eleven.
- I want you out of there now.

519
00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:27.181
Give me the earpiece.

520
00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:28.766
Nine, Ethan. Eight.

521
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:32.394
If you don't get out of there,
I'm coming in and getting you out.

522
00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:34.313
Get out of there.

523
00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:38.650
You place your bet, ma'am?

524
00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:42.279
Just

525
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.367
<i>horses are ready to race.</i>

526
00:54:56.502 --> 00:54:57.586
Come on!

527
00:54:57.669 --> 00:55:00.714
Come on! Your nag's making a run
for it on the outside.

528
00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:05.093
Come on!

529
00:55:09.765 --> 00:55:12.059
You picked another winner!

530
00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:21.068
I thought you were going to dinner.

531
00:55:22.194 --> 00:55:25.572
Hugh, take care
of the nekhorvich memory card.

532
00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:28.867
Where is it?

533
00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:31.870
In the envelope in my jacket pocket.

534
00:55:34.748 --> 00:55:37.334
My right jacket pocket.

535
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.756
<i>We at our state-of-the-art,
solar-powered biocyte building</i>

536
00:55:42.798 --> 00:55:45.759
<i>recognize that eternal vigilance
is the price of health</i>

537
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:47.511
<i>whether it's funding the teaching center</i>

538
00:55:47.594 --> 00:55:49.096
<i>at the royal prince Edward hospital,</i>

539
00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.473
<i>removing aerosol products
from the market</i>

540
00:55:51.557 --> 00:55:55.227
<i>or braving the influenza quarantine
at bruny island late last month.</i>

541
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.687
<i>At biocyte,</i>

542
00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.439
<i>your life is our life's work.</i>

543
00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:03.777
We've got an opportunity here.

544
00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:06.446
I'm not going to miss it.

545
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:39.104
Mccloy: George, take me home.

546
00:56:56.663 --> 00:56:57.956
George.

547
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:02.669
George.

548
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.765
What the hell?

549
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:19.227
<i>George!</i>

550
00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:28.528
<i>George. George!</i>

551
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.663
Sean?

552
00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:43.168
Sean.

553
00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:23.583
Shh. Shh. Shh.

554
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.045
Easy.

555
00:58:28.255 --> 00:58:29.589
Oh, Ethan.

556
00:58:29.798 --> 00:58:31.258
Are you okay?

557
00:58:31.633 --> 00:58:33.176
Yeah, I am now.

558
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.683
Mccloy: What is this?

559
00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.227
A visit from an old friend.

560
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:28.940
You crashed on the plane. You're dead.

561
00:59:29.357 --> 00:59:30.984
Tired, certainly.

562
00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:33.612
But dead is a little extreme.

563
00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:36.323
On the other hand

564
00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:40.452
when my colleague gradski had
your pulse and your blood pressure

565
00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:43.914
he had less than a day to live.

566
00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:50.879
You're infected with chimera, my friend.

567
00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:56.009
No use, my friend.

568
00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:58.428
The medical staff

569
00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.305
wants no part of this.

570
01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:04.351
Doctors don't fancy the idea of dying
any more than anybody else.

571
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.603
How could I possibly be infected?

572
01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:11.274
That's exactly what gradski said
27 hours before he died.

573
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.278
You've got the antidote,
you miserable bastard!

574
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.864
- You stole bellerophon. All of it!
- My, my, my.

575
01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:18.907
Ineedit

576
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.701
I need it now,
you whacked-out Russian gypsy!

577
01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:26.623
And what about gradski, who you
deliberately infected with chimera?

578
01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:31.044
How was I to know he needed treatment
with bellerophon within 20 hours?

579
01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.587
By asking me.

580
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.965
You still don't get it, do you?

581
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:38.885
I needed to knowjust how bad
the disease was in the real world

582
01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.595
not just the lab.

583
01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:44.099
You were genetically splicing together
strains of influenza

584
01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.685
to create a cure for all influenzas.

585
01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:50.438
But you were also creating
a disease so terrible in chimera

586
01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:53.150
the cure would be priceless.

587
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.236
I needed chimera
in order to peddle bellerophon.

588
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:59.072
It's not that difficult to understand, is it?

589
01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.742
Look, I've got the virus,
you've got the cure.

590
01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.452
I need them both.

591
01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:09.040
Time was, a shot of penicillin
would knock off every bug in the zoo.

592
01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.584
Not anymore.

593
01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:15.130
If I couldn't make money killing
the microscopic little shits out there

594
01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:18.925
you'd help me put one out there
that I could make money on.

595
01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:22.220
Well, there it is. I've confessed.

596
01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.557
I, John c. Mccloy

597
01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.394
am in business to make money.

598
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.482
Now forget any deal you may have made
with that thug ambrose

599
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.694
get me treated,
and let's go back to work.

600
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.571
You know

601
01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:44.117
I think it's a little late for that.

602
01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:47.704
Do give my regards to gradski

603
01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.415
if you see him.

604
01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:02.802
Well?

605
01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:08.183
I've heard

606
01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.647
all I need to hear.

607
01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:17.901
Nyah.

608
01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:24.658
It's imperative that we do nothing
to alarm ambrose.

609
01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:26.701
What?

610
01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.704
You told me to leave as soon as I could.

611
01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.581
I thought you were here to collect me!

612
01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.753
Listen to me. There's no time to talk.

613
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.589
It is critical,

614
01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.300
absolutely critical

615
01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:46.346
that you do whatever ambrose asks.

616
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.726
Do you understand me?

617
01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.189
Don't worry.

618
01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.193
It will all be over

619
01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.279
very soon.

620
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.454
That's a promise.

621
01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:14.040
Come on.

622
01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:18.712
Off you go.

623
01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.453
Luther, we know this much.

624
01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:55.248
Nekhorvich gets on a plane to go to the
center for disease control in Atlanta.

625
01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:58.168
He's carrying a virus he created,
chimera,

626
01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:01.588
and the cure for that virus, bellerophon.

627
01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.843
Ambrose doesn't have the virus.

628
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.220
That's why ambrose needs mccloy.

629
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.767
So we go into biocyte, kill chimera

630
01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:19.272
ambrose has a cure without a disease
and we're home free.

631
01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:21.941
<i>You were right.</i>

632
01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.402
Hunt stung mccloy tonight.

633
01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:27.072
So he knows.

634
01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.699
He'll be going into biocyte.

635
01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:32.619
Good.

636
01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:35.914
Then we know where he'll be, don't we?

637
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.751
Well done, Hugh.

638
01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.129
Well done.

639
01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.602
You're home, mate. Home.

640
01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:04.818
Where's George, my regular driver?
Where is he?

641
01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.529
He's gone home sick. Touch of the flu.

642
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.991
The building up and running yet?

643
01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:20.500
- That's not exactly it.
- Sorry, but this is a biocyte facility.

644
01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.210
Their storage structure.

645
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:23.711
I'll have it up in a minute.

646
01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.341
Okay, take a look at this.

647
01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:29.968
Let's start from the inside out.

648
01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:33.096
All storage and production of chimera
is done here

649
01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.598
in this lab on the 42nd floor.

650
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:38.810
Hunt's target will be the chimera

651
01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:42.856
stored and manufactured at biocyte
on the 42nd floor.

652
01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:48.361
If you look at hunt's operational history,
and I have,

653
01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:52.407
he invariably favors misdirection
over confrontation.

654
01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:55.493
<i>He'll never
break into biocyte from the bottom,</i>

655
01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:57.287
<i>where security is heaviest.</i>

656
01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.581
No garage entrances.

657
01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:03.042
Lobby's protected by five guards
on rotating patrol.

658
01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:08.089
Not going in from the ground.
Show me the atrium.

659
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.885
The atrium? One of a kind.

660
01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:14.512
Runs down through
the center of the building.

661
01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:18.725
Provides 24-hour natural light
via mirrors and daylight storage cells,

662
01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:21.186
<i>optimum growing conditions
for the virus.</i>

663
01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:24.939
<i>Ends in a glass floor
which doubles as part of the lab ceiling.</i>

664
01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.569
Uh-uh.

665
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.280
The atrium roof closes at sundown.

666
01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.575
And if the louvers are up
for more than 40 seconds at night,

667
01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:39.412
the civil emergency alarms are tripped.
Those even I can't stop.

668
01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.584
We have a total of 40 seconds
to get you in and the cables out.

669
01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:52.175
Hunt will prefer to enter biocyte
from the top, where security is minimal.

670
01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:56.095
He'll undoubtedly engage
in some aerobatic insanity

671
01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:59.432
before he'll risk harming a hair
on a security guard's head.

672
01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:16.616
- Check, check. Copy?
- You're five-by-five.

673
01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.830
Luther, how we doing?

674
01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.416
Not there yet, Ethan.
I'll give you the word.

675
01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.630
Billy, ready to go?

676
01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:38.471
- Package away in five.
- Not yet. The louvers aren't moving.

677
01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.306
Luther, we gotta go.

678
01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:42.517
<i>Wait.
There's a glitch in the access code.</i>

679
01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:55.321
<i>Luther, we're out of time.
On the count.</i>

680
01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:58.324
Please, baby, open up. Open up.

681
01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.743
Five, four...

682
01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:03.830
- Come on!
-...Three, two, one!

683
01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.374
-L'm going now!
- Ethan, wait!

684
01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:45.955
<i>25, 24, 23,</i>

685
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:50.043
22, 21, 20.

686
01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.213
You've got 19 seconds
to clear the cable.

687
01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:04.223
Okay, retracting cable.

688
01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.730
Come on.

689
01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.902
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,

690
01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.072
<i>four, three, two...</i>

691
01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.659
Cable's clear!

692
01:09:36.422 --> 01:09:38.049
Transponder activated.

693
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.426
Reading package and cable clear.

694
01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.396
He'll breach the lab
at the only possible time.

695
01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.815
Whether you break in from the ground
or the roof,

696
01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:57.235
it's 23:00 hours, one minute

697
01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:00.822
when the air filtration generators
will cover the sound of hunt's break-in

698
01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:05.118
and rotating guards make the building
vulnerable to our break-in from below.

699
01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:09.956
<i>Ethan, the generators
are about to go active.</i>

700
01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:13.167
Just a friendly reminder,
we'll be out of contact for eight minutes.

701
01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.411
<i>I'm betting hunt will destroy chimera</i>

702
01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.289
rather than attempt to preserve
any part of it.

703
01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:54.041
He'll have to do it in two places.

704
01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.002
First,

705
01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:59.756
the incubation room
where the growth vials are kept.

706
01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.094
<i>And finally, in the inoculation chamber</i>

707
01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:09.015
<i>holding the last remaining
chimera virus and three injection guns.</i>

708
01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:14.812
He won't be allowed to destroy the virus
in those guns.

709
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:32.955
What's this? You're on time for once?

710
01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.874
Not exactly, sport.

711
01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:44.050
<i>John c. Mccloy.</i>

712
01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:06.989
Billy, we've got a problem.

713
01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:10.660
<i>Nyah's on the wing up early.
Billy, do you copy?</i>

714
01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.996
Yeah, I got you, Luther.
Exactly where is she?

715
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.499
- In the building.
- Say again, mate.

716
01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.126
Sounds like you said
she's in the building.

717
01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.628
I am. She is.

718
01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:25.716
Well, then, she's not likely
to be alone, is she?

719
01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:28.469
She's in the elevator
headed towards Ethan.

720
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.263
The question is, how many of them?

721
01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:33.224
I can't get through to Ethan
till the generators go off.

722
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:34.392
When's that?

723
01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:37.270
Not for another five-and-a-half minutes.

724
01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:15.308
<i>Chimera in vitro ph</i>

725
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.895
<i>and temperature level
outside optimal range.</i>

726
01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.480
<i>Chimera in vitro ph</i>

727
01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:25.192
<i>and temperature level
outside optimal range.</i>

728
01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:29.655
<i>Chimera working seed stock ph
at critical level.</i>

729
01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:33.659
<i>Alert. Chimera stock life threatened.</i>

730
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.705
<i>Alert. Chimera stock life terminated.</i>

731
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.671
Come on, Ethan. Come on.

732
01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.315
<i>Subject is contaminant-free.</i>

733
01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.567
<i>Zero contaminant factor.</i>

734
01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.581
Come on, come on.

735
01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.834
<i>Luther, what the hell can we do?</i>

736
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.586
What can we do?

737
01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:30.174
Hope he kills all the bugs before
the yellow dot gets to the red one.

738
01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.394
<i>However we travel,</i>

739
01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:27.565
<i>I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.</i>

740
01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.447
<i>Mccloy: How was I to know</i>

741
01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:37.199
<i>he needed treatment with bellerophon
within 20 hours?</i>

742
01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:02.516
Get him.

743
01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.333
How much longer
before you can reach him?

744
01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:30.544
We got 29 seconds
before the generators turn off.

745
01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:32.671
Then Ethan'll be back on line.

746
01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:20.553
Luther!

747
01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.504
Hold your fire!

748
01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:57.673
Hold your fire, damn it!

749
01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:13.814
Well, hunt,

750
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.443
how you been?

751
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.573
Fighting a bit of a cold.

752
01:18:27.995 --> 01:18:30.748
That was the hardest part
of having to portray you,

753
01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.876
grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes.

754
01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:38.297
I always thought the hardest part
was curbing that pressing need of yours

755
01:18:38.339 --> 01:18:39.840
to get your gun off.

756
01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.636
You were in such a hurry
to knock off that 747,

757
01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.804
you never figured out
where chimera really was.

758
01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.432
- I knew where it was.
- Oh.

759
01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:52.144
Then you knew the only way
nekhorvich could smuggle the live virus

760
01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:53.479
was by injecting himself,

761
01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.773
and using his own bloodstream
as a petri dish.

762
01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.316
You knew that

763
01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:01.737
while you were knocking him off,
destroying the very thing you came for.

764
01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.454
Stop!

765
01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:12.331
Put a sock in it!

766
01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:18.254
Hit that bloody gun, and you'll spread
that virus all over the place!

767
01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:21.298
There it is, guys.

768
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.843
The last of it.

769
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.304
What was the top bid?

770
01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.932
Why?
You gonna make me a better offer?

771
01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:34.061
Than 37 million pounds? Not really.

772
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:36.313
Oh.

773
01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:40.943
Somebody has been slipping you
our mail.

774
01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:45.364
Come on out here, you bad girl.

775
01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.546
She doesn't belong here.

776
01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.214
Let her go.

777
01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:08.220
She wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you, hunt.

778
01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:20.024
From this moment, you are responsible
for what happens to her.

779
01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.693
And if you're looking out
for her well-being,

780
01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:27.740
I suggest you advise her to pick up
the injection gun and bring it to me.

781
01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.869
The ball's in your court, hunt.

782
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.627
Nyah's in the building.

783
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.629
<i>Do you copy?</i>

784
01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:44.882
Thank you.

785
01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:04.026
How do you know he won't shoot you
the minute he's got it?

786
01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.279
One can't hold nyah responsible
for her actions.

787
01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:08.864
You know women, mate.

788
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:11.367
Like monkeys they are.

789
01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:14.953
Won't let go of one branch
till they get a grip on the next.

790
01:21:17.664 --> 01:21:20.584
Get it, nyah. I'll cover you.

791
01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:56.036
I am waiting.

792
01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:10.676
Things haven't exactly worked out
the way you thought they would, Ethan.

793
01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:13.887
Sorry.

794
01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.531
You bitch!

795
01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:52.342
You're not gonna shoot me, Sean.
Not this bitch.

796
01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:56.346
'Cause she's worth 37 million pounds.

797
01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:30.839
- What did you think you were doing?
- I wasn't thinking!

798
01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:34.009
Just trying to stop you
from getting hurt, that's all.

799
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.012
You who don't have a conscience.

800
01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:39.306
Iguesslhed.

801
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.086
You can't get us both out of here,
can you?

802
01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:24.601
I'm infected with chimera.

803
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:27.646
You know you don't have a choice.
Just do it.

804
01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:30.857
Do it. Now!

805
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.548
We've got 19 hours and 58 minutes.

806
01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:57.843
I'll get bellerophon into your system
before then.

807
01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:04.766
Just stay alive!
I'm not going to lose you!

808
01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:17.547
Feel like pleading for your life?

809
01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:29.518
Well, then how about dying
so you can make me a lot of money.

810
01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:38.026
In just a few hours time

811
01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:42.989
you can be assured of going down
in history as the typhoid Mary of oz.

812
01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:45.784
Good day.

813
01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:52.958
There's not a chance of locating nyah
until I can access the satellite.

814
01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:55.752
I can't do that till I get
this computer fixed,

815
01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:57.254
and that's taking a while.

816
01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.923
- How much time does she have left?
- Not long.

817
01:27:00.424 --> 01:27:04.136
- But nyah will take care of nyah.
- What do you mean?

818
01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.180
Unless we dose her with bellerophon,
nyah will kill herself.

819
01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:10.308
So first things first.

820
01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:09.034
Ambrose and his team
have arrived over the bridge,

821
01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.368
<i>and nyah's not with him.</i>

822
01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:11.495
Copy that.

823
01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:22.923
You all right, mate?
Looks like heavy security from here.

824
01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.383
<i>What's it look like from there?</i>

825
01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:28.720
Risky.

826
01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:48.967
Simon.

827
01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.637
Stay here.

828
01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:11.573
Breached the structure
at the 10:00 grating.

829
01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:27.714
It's a DNA match.
The blood's loaded with chimera.

830
01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.309
And they certainly have bellerophon.

831
01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:46.399
You've got the virus and the antivirus,
which means I've got 30 million for you.

832
01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:50.320
Not exactly.
We don't want just your cash.

833
01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:54.366
- What do you want?
- Stock, Mr. mccloy.

834
01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:58.370
Stock options
to be a little more precise.

835
01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:09.923
Cut her loose right in the center of town.

836
01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.050
The more crowded, the better.

837
01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:15.887
<i>Just picked up an ambrose call.</i>

838
01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.472
Nyah's been dropped off.

839
01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:19.391
<i>-/ think she's still alive.
- Where is she?</i>

840
01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:21.685
Somewhere in Sydney.

841
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:34.781
Somewhere in Sydney?
Care to harden the target?

842
01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.244
<i>I can't until I can get the GPS
up on our computer. It's still down.</i>

843
01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.206
The clock is ticking.

844
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.876
How quickly can you manufacture
more of the antivirus?

845
01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:49.713
- No time at all, once I've got it.
- Good.

846
01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:53.091
Biocyte stock is just a few weeks away
from going through the roof.

847
01:31:53.133 --> 01:31:55.885
- What are you talking about?
- An outbreak of chimera.

848
01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:59.723
- Where?
- Downtown Sydney, for a start.

849
01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:03.393
You create the supply, Mr. mccloy.
We've just created the demand.

850
01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:07.564
Three million people in Sydney
and 17 million people in Australia

851
01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:10.358
are going to need bellerophon
within the next few days.

852
01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:12.277
Not to mention the rest of the world.

853
01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:14.946
Now, this is how it's going to work.

854
01:32:15.447 --> 01:32:18.116
- The shares outstanding are?
-93.4 million.

855
01:32:18.158 --> 01:32:19.576
Which means, Mr. mccloy,

856
01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:23.413
we need to get our hands
on 480,000 options.

857
01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:26.291
We'll borrow your 30 million
to buy those options.

858
01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:29.753
Your stock has never sold
above $31 a share.

859
01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:33.965
When your stock goes north of 200,
which it will,

860
01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:36.217
those options will be worth billions,

861
01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:41.681
and I will own 51 percent of biocyte.

862
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:43.475
This is outrageous.

863
01:32:44.476 --> 01:32:47.771
I will not let you take control
of my company.

864
01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:50.356
Sit down.

865
01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:33.191
You'll be a billionaire.
That's better than being broke.

866
01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:36.194
I have terrorists
and other pharmaceutical companies

867
01:33:36.236 --> 01:33:37.487
standing in line.

868
01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:46.246
The ball's in your court, Mr. mccloy.

869
01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:44.053
Run that bastard down.

870
01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:01.404
We're running short on time,
Mr. mccloy.

871
01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.824
We have got to conclude our business.

872
01:35:06.743 --> 01:35:07.952
Yes.

873
01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:10.288
Start the transfer.

874
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:19.505
Follow it and let me know.

875
01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:31.202
Raise your hands very slowly.

876
01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:33.955
Sure you want me to do this?

877
01:36:34.872 --> 01:36:38.001
Raise your hands very slowly.

878
01:37:11.534 --> 01:37:13.244
Ethan. Ethan, do you copy?

879
01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:22.378
Keep it going-

880
01:37:29.552 --> 01:37:33.348
<i>Sean,
this rat's reached the end of the maze.</i>

881
01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:35.933
Ls he alive?

882
01:37:36.392 --> 01:37:38.770
<i>Yeah, more or less.</i>

883
01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:42.815
Bring him to me.

884
01:37:43.232 --> 01:37:44.275
Go.

885
01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:54.160
Sean, transfer completed.

886
01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:18.184
Well done, stamp. Well done.

887
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:39.414
Stop mumbling!

888
01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:44.127
I'm afraid he's got no choice.
I believe I broke his jaw.

889
01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:48.214
Stamp, I'm impressed.

890
01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:50.883
We don't have a lot of time, hunt.

891
01:38:50.967 --> 01:38:53.761
Whatever you've got to say, say it now.

892
01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:58.349
How about giving us a big smile?

893
01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:02.103
No?

894
01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:03.604
What are you doing?

895
01:39:05.064 --> 01:39:08.734
Get down on your knees.

896
01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:15.533
Now, this is what's known

897
01:39:15.825 --> 01:39:18.119
as getting your gun off.

898
01:40:28.898 --> 01:40:30.358
There he is!

899
01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:42.328
Ethan!

900
01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:00.930
Just back off
and pinpoint their positions!

901
01:41:59.155 --> 01:42:01.574
Luther, clear the bridge for me.

902
01:42:05.703 --> 01:42:09.040
Hunt's heading for the bridge,
coming in at 12:00 high.

903
01:42:25.723 --> 01:42:27.350
Oh, I'm mad now.

904
01:43:38.129 --> 01:43:41.424
- You all right, mate?
- That punk put a hole in my versace.

905
01:44:45.321 --> 01:44:47.615
Ethan, the computer's up. I've got nyah.

906
01:44:47.698 --> 01:44:49.325
<i>She's moved out of the city.</i>

907
01:44:49.366 --> 01:44:51.702
She's on the north bluff
approaching the cliffs,

908
01:44:51.744 --> 01:44:53.329
<i>but I can't get a visual.</i>

909
01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:56.540
Copy! She's only got a little time left!

910
01:44:56.624 --> 01:44:59.251
Track ahead and pick her up!

911
01:45:06.008 --> 01:45:07.593
I can't get a good shot!

912
01:45:07.676 --> 01:45:09.512
Ethan, we won't be able to cover you.

913
01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:14.183
My earpiece is failing.
You've got me on GPS.

914
01:45:14.225 --> 01:45:16.185
Bring her to me.

915
01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:27.071
Billy, north head bluff. Haul ass.

916
01:45:53.973 --> 01:45:57.351
- Get out there and keep firing!
- I can't see anything!

917
01:45:57.476 --> 01:46:00.104
Slow down, mate, slow down!

918
01:48:00.432 --> 01:48:02.226
Range is 2

919
01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:38.483
go ahead. Use it, hunt.

920
01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.111
It's not a bad way to go.

921
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:45.157
It's a lot better than the way
that bitch is gonna die.

922
01:52:32.788 --> 01:52:34.164
There she is!

923
01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:40.415
Hunt!

924
01:54:44.127 --> 01:54:47.547
You should've killed me.

925
01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.900
<i>Miss hall's blood
has absolutely no elements</i>

926
01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:31.109
<i>of the chimera virus,</i>

927
01:56:31.193 --> 01:56:32.861
<i>not even antibodies.</i>

928
01:56:34.738 --> 01:56:36.615
Yes, I gathered as much.

929
01:56:36.698 --> 01:56:42.329
But you were under specific instructions
to retrieve a live sample of the virus.

930
01:56:42.954 --> 01:56:46.124
I'd be very interested to know how,
after you'd managed this recovery,

931
01:56:46.208 --> 01:56:48.376
it subsequently got destroyed.

932
01:56:49.586 --> 01:56:50.837
By fire.

933
01:56:51.463 --> 01:56:53.757
- It's the best way, really.
- Oh.

934
01:56:55.425 --> 01:56:59.638
Well, as for miss hall,
in light of her efforts

935
01:57:01.097 --> 01:57:04.226
her criminal record
will certainly be expunged.

936
01:57:04.267 --> 01:57:05.519
Wiped out.

937
01:57:05.936 --> 01:57:07.896
I'm assuming you approve.

938
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:12.317
I do.

939
01:57:13.902 --> 01:57:15.695
Where is she now? Any idea?

940
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:19.449
I don't know. Not exactly.

941
01:57:20.825 --> 01:57:23.411
<i>- So what are your plans?
- I don't know.</i>

942
01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:28.625
<i>Some sort of vacation.
I'll let you know where I'm going.</i>

943
01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:31.294
<i>Don't have to do that.</i>

944
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:34.548
<i>It wouldn't be a vacation if you did.</i>

945
01:58:25.348 --> 01:58:27.225
Let's get lost.
