248
00:26:29.009 --> 00:26:30.594
An idea? Yeah.

249
00:26:30.969 --> 00:26:33.680
- Like?
- It's a good idea to get him now.

250
00:26:33.931 --> 00:26:38.185
A bad idea to fly him on a commercial
carrier. Is he still in Sydney?

251
00:26:38.685 --> 00:26:41.021
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.

252
00:26:42.689 --> 00:26:46.193
So is his colleague Gradski,
but that happened earlier.

253
00:26:46.443 --> 00:26:48.695
We had Nekhorvich on a flight
from Sydney

254
00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:50.906
that crashed in the Rockies.

255
00:26:51.365 --> 00:26:52.449
Dead.

256
00:26:52.699 --> 00:26:54.701
Are you listening to me?

257
00:26:56.245 --> 00:26:59.123
If he didn't want to go anywhere
without me

258
00:27:00.415 --> 00:27:02.543
how did you get him on that flight?

259
00:27:02.584 --> 00:27:04.128
You were there.

260
00:27:11.718 --> 00:27:14.221
When I couldn't find you,
I had to replace you.

261
00:27:14.263 --> 00:27:16.598
Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.

262
00:27:16.682 --> 00:27:19.101
He doubled you two or three times.

263
00:27:21.812 --> 00:27:24.064
- Twice.
- What did you think of him?

264
00:27:27.526 --> 00:27:31.655
We had reservations about each other.
It's a bit late to be asking me that.

265
00:27:31.738 --> 00:27:33.407
No, not necessarily.

266
00:27:33.448 --> 00:27:34.992
Airline records

267
00:27:36.034 --> 00:27:39.788
list a Captain Harold Macintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.

268
00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:43.750
As far as the media and all the
governmental agencies are concerned

269
00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:46.420
Captain Macintosh died in the flight.

270
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.463
But, in fact, he missed it.

271
00:27:49.173 --> 00:27:51.633
He did, however, make the next flight

272
00:27:51.925 --> 00:27:53.177
in cargo

273
00:27:53.886 --> 00:27:57.598
stuffed into a rather small suitcase,
considering his size.

274
00:27:58.515 --> 00:28:01.226
Someone on that flight
planned an operation

275
00:28:01.268 --> 00:28:03.520
designed to bring the plane down and
make it look like an accident.

276
00:28:03.604 --> 00:28:06.732
Someone skillful enough
to bring it off without a hitch.

277
00:28:08.275 --> 00:28:11.320
There's one thing we know
that Ambrose doesn't.

278
00:28:11.403 --> 00:28:14.865
Then you do think it was Ambrose?
You're not surprised?

279
00:28:15.365 --> 00:28:16.825
Sean feels he hasn't done the job

280
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:18.827
unless he leaves a lot of hats
on the ground.

281
00:28:18.911 --> 00:28:20.454
The question is why.

282
00:28:20.537 --> 00:28:23.540
What was this Chimera
Nekhorvich was carrying?

283
00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:26.501
Only Ambrose knows that.

284
00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:30.797
In any case,
you must recover this Chimera

285
00:28:30.881 --> 00:28:32.633
and bring it to us.

286
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.262
In order to do that, I've got to figure
out how he plans to make money on it.

287
00:28:37.304 --> 00:28:39.431
That is where Miss Hall comes in.

288
00:28:44.144 --> 00:28:45.479
Excuse me?

289
00:28:46.063 --> 00:28:48.232
Miss Hall and Ambrose
had a relationship

290
00:28:48.315 --> 00:28:49.566
which he took very seriously.

291
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.653
She walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.

292
00:28:52.736 --> 00:28:55.989
We believe she's our surest and
quickest way of locating him.

293
00:28:56.031 --> 00:28:57.532
And then what?

294
00:28:58.367 --> 00:29:00.452
Well, make sure
she continues to see him

295
00:29:00.494 --> 00:29:03.497
gets him to confide in her,
and report to you.

296
00:29:18.303 --> 00:29:20.973
You made it sound as if
I was recruiting her

297
00:29:21.014 --> 00:29:23.058
for her skills as a thief.

298
00:29:23.892 --> 00:29:27.271
Well, then I mislead you
or you made the wrong assumption.

299
00:29:27.354 --> 00:29:31.024
Either way, we are asking her
to resume a prior relationship

300
00:29:31.108 --> 00:29:33.443
not do anything she hasn't already done.

301
00:29:33.527 --> 00:29:35.529
Voluntarily, I might add.

302
00:29:38.073 --> 00:29:41.285
No, she's got no training
for this kind of thing.

303
00:29:41.868 --> 00:29:43.328
To go to bed with a man and lie to him?

304
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.290
She's a woman.
She's got all the training she needs.

305
00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:54.881
I don't think I can get her to do it.

306
00:29:55.007 --> 00:29:57.050
- You mean it'll be difficult.
- Very.

307
00:29:57.134 --> 00:30:00.512
Well, this is not Mission: Difficult,
Mr. Hunt. It's Mission: Impossible.

308
00:30:00.554 --> 00:30:02.472
Difficult should be
a walk in the park for you.

309
00:30:02.556 --> 00:30:04.057
I'm open to suggestion.

310
00:30:04.099 --> 00:30:06.059
If you can think of a quicker way
to get to Ambrose

311
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:07.311
you're welcome to try.

312
00:30:07.394 --> 00:30:08.729
You might want to take a look at these

313
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.274
if you have any further qualms about
getting her to do the job.

314
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.960
How many people are capable
of something like that?

315
00:31:17.923 --> 00:31:19.466
Sean Ambrose

316
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:21.093
for one.

317
00:31:27.808 --> 00:31:28.975
Right.

318
00:31:39.653 --> 00:31:42.280
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.

319
00:31:46.493 --> 00:31:48.995
But it is what you'd like me to do.

320
00:31:53.333 --> 00:31:54.376
What?

321
00:31:54.459 --> 00:31:57.337
Oh, let my conscience be my guide.
Is that it?

322
00:31:57.421 --> 00:31:58.505
Something like that.

323
00:31:58.588 --> 00:32:01.216
I don't have a conscience.
I'm a bloody thief.

324
00:32:05.554 --> 00:32:07.848
You're gonna try and force me
to do this?

325
00:32:07.889 --> 00:32:09.933
Generally, I don't favor
coercing someone

326
00:32:10.016 --> 00:32:13.437
not when there's a chance
my life could end up in their hands.

327
00:32:13.895 --> 00:32:15.605
Is that the only reason?

328
00:32:16.022 --> 00:32:18.316
- Can you think of a better one?
- Me? No.

329
00:32:18.358 --> 00:32:21.027
I was hoping you might, thinking that
somewhere in the course of business

330
00:32:21.111 --> 00:32:23.321
this got personal as well as physical!

331
00:32:23.363 --> 00:32:26.366
Okay. Would it make you feel any better
if I didn't want you to do this?

332
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.702
- Yeah, much.
- Then feel better!

333
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.367
Sean will never be anything
but suspicious if I pitch up

334
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:11.745
saying, "Hey, honey, I'm home."

335
00:33:13.413 --> 00:33:15.207
What wouldn't make him suspicious?

336
00:33:15.248 --> 00:33:17.876
That I needed him in some urgent way.

337
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.213
Destitute,

338
00:33:21.254 --> 00:33:23.006
in serious trouble,

339
00:33:23.089 --> 00:33:26.009
the kind
I couldn't possibly sort out myself.

340
00:33:26.927 --> 00:33:28.762
Serious trouble, Nyah

341
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:32.140
is something I can always arrange.

342
00:33:36.144 --> 00:33:39.397

Nekhorvich was a molecular biologist.

Why is he going on

414
00:42:09.532 --> 00:42:12.827
Nekhorvich specialized in
recombining DNA molecules.

415

In the myth

416
00:42:16.456 --> 00:42:19.500
Bellerophon was a prince
who killed the Chimera,

417
00:42:20.793 --> 00:42:23.254
a monster with the head of a lion

418

645

a disease so terrible in Chimera

647
01:00:53.238 --> 01:00:56.241

Luther, we know this much.

685
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:55.253
Nekhorvich gets on a plane to go to the
Center for Disease Control in Atlanta.

686
01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.173
He's carrying a virus he created,
Chimera,

687
01:03:58.631 --> 01:04:01.593
and the cure for that virus, Bellerophon.

688
01:04:05.138 --> 01:04:06.848
Ambrose doesn't have the virus.

689
01:04:07.015 --> 01:04:09.225
That's why Ambrose needs McCloy.

690
01:04:10.852 --> 01:04:13.772
So we go into Biocyte, kill Chimera

691
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:19.277
Ambrose has a cure without a disease
and we're home free.
