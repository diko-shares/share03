1
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.760
Widow 12, Foxtrot 217.

2
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.200
Nothing seen. We are RTB and Bingo.

3
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.480
<i>Foxtrot 217, Widow 12, all copied.</i>

4
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.720
<i>Safe trip home.
Contact Zeus for routing.</i>

5
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.960
Foxtrot 217 switching Zeus.

6
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.416
Johnson,
let Base know we're inbound.

7
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.120
ETA minute 25.

8
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.896
I'll tell them to put the kettle on.

9
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920
Make mine a pint.

10
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400
Missile launch.

11
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.920
- Nine o'clock.
- Break right!

12
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.600
Flares, flares!

13
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080
Thanks, Mum.

14
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.280
{\an5}Dream of flying.

15
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920
I can't hold her!

16
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560
Losing altitude!

17
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.720
Eject. Eject!

18
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.280
Sinclair, it's me. You're okay.

19
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.760
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

20
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

21
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.000
This is Foxtrot 217.
Does anybody copy? Over.

22
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.760
Mayday, mayday.
This is Foxtrot 217. Do you copy?

23
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.360
<i>This is Foxtrot 217
transmitting in the blind.</i>

24
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.800
<i>My aircraft is down
and my WSO is dead.</i>

25
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.920
<i>The crash site is hot.
Repeat. The crash site is hot.</i>

26
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.640
<i>I can't stay here.</i>

27
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.200
<i>Initiating evasion plan. Out.</i>

28
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.960
<i>USSR Territory</i>

29
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400
Fuck that.

30
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.680
Oh, fuck.

31
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.240
<i>Laboratory</i>

32
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.520
<i>Forgive me</i>

33
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.160
Fuck! Did you see that?

34
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.680
Look alive, people.
Possible target on our 12.

35
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.720
Everett, get on the deuce.
Serano, hit the lights.

36
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.880
For fuck's sake. Friendly!

37
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.000
Is that a woman?

38
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.360
Calm down, Casanova.

39
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.336
Corporal, go check her out.
Serano, take the back.

40
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.280
- Everett, eyes open.
- On it, Sarge.

41
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.960
Great going, you morons.

42
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.040
Show us your hands!

43
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.280
- Do I look like a fucking insurgent?
- Gun.

44
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.640
- We're not safe here.
- Tell me about it.

45
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.520
- We have to go.
- Quicker we get this done...

46
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.880
- quicker we get out of here.
- You have to listen to me.

47
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.400
- Identify yourself.
- Flight Lieutenant Sinclair

48
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480
Royal Air Force.

49
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.840
- She checks out.
- Our missing pilot.

50
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.880
You're goddamn lucky
we found you out here.

51
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.600
- Hey, that's mine!
- Back off!

52
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.680
- Lafayette, take it easy.
- She's clear.

53
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.480
Are you deaf or just fucking dumb?
We can't stay here!

54
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.120
- Serano?
- I got nothing.

55
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.680
Take a breath, Captain. We got you.

56
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.200
Located the crash site

57
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.680
found your WSO
along with four enemy KIA.

58
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.560
We got you to thank for that?

59
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.040
I can't take all the credit.

60
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.360
Johnson bagged one of them,
saving my life.

61
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.120
Well, you did good getting this far.

62
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.360
We'd just about given up on you.
Come on.

63
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.960
Oh, it's a good job that you didn't.

64
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.600
Do I have a story to tell you.

65
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.960
All right. All right.
Serano, get her in the vehicle.

66
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.720
Patch her up on the way.
Lafayette, let's go.

67
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.720
Welcome to Second Ranger Battalion

68
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.960
Forward Operations Base,
Camp Cooper.

69
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.680
Did anyone contact my CO?

70
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.440
I need to get word to my family.

71
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.680
Soon as you were picked up.

72
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.280
Family know you're safe.

73
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.560
Just let the doc
take a look at that wound.

74
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.960
After I talk to your CI.

75
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.720
<i>Captain, we're all a little mad here.</i>

76
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.720
Hell, you'd have to be crazy
not to be.

77
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.360
A lot's happened
in the past 24 hours.

78
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.520
This place has gone
from a ghost town to slap-bang

79
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.080
in the middle of the biggest
insurgent mobilization

80
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.560
this sector's seen in years.

81
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.920
Shooting down your aircraft
was just the opening salvo.

82
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.480
Sir, I've flown 28 combat missions
in three tours

83
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.960
and yesterday I was shot down,
crashed in the desert

84
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.856
and hunted by men that wanted
to cut my head off

85
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.880
and post it on YouTube.

86
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.200
But none of that scared me
half as much

87
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.560
as what I saw in that bunker.

88
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.040
Captain, I don't doubt
your credentials

89
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.200
but given the present situation,
the safety of my men is paramount.

90
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.200
Now, this place
may not look like much

91
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.520
but despite appearances,
I like to run a...

92
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.280
tight ship.

93
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.720
Patrol's coming in.

94
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.440
<i>Now, we were winding down
operations here</i>

95
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.880
<i>but now this new insurgency
requires the full extent</i>

96
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.440
<i>of what little resources I have.</i>

97
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.640
Everything else takes a back seat.

98
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.080
- Cheers.
- After what I saw last night

99
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.080
I'd say insurgents
are the least of your worries.

100
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.680
Listen, I get it.

101
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.400
The violence they're capable of.
The terror.

102
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.360
It's easy to see them as monsters,
but they're just men.

103
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.680
This was no fucking man, sir.

104
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.640
I saw it rip a man's face
from his skull.

105
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.480
It had claws
the size of a grizzly bear.

106
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.040
- Major.
- Sergeant.

107
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.320
Our British friends
picked up a Terry on patrol.

108
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.416
Could be one of the group
that brought down

109
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440
the captain's aircraft.

110
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.000
Thank you, Sergeant.

111
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.680
Let's see what we can get out of him.

112
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.880
Oh, and they didn't happen
to come across

113
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.600
any secret Russian bunkers, did they?

114
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.320
Sir?

115
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200
It's there.

116
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.520
I can take you right to it.

117
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.840
Captain, what combat experience
have you had?

118
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.960
Well, I made it this far.

119
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.160
I've seen her handiwork, sir.
I can vouch for her.

120
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.840
Cool your heels, Sergeant.
Ain't nobody going no place.

121
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.840
Sir, if you're not prepared
to take this threat seriously

122
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.896
then do me a favor
and get me on the first ride out.

123
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.800
I wish I could, believe me.

124
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.440
We already evac'd all nonessentials

125
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.600
and they won't send another bird
until things cool off.

126
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.440
So until then, you remain our guest.

127
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.720
And this microfilm camera here...

128
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.760
well, this stays with me
till Army Intel gets eyes on it.

129
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.240
That is all, Captain.

130
00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.280
Now, go see Doc Wilks.
Get that wound seen to.

131
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.761
- Sir, I'd like to go check it out.
- Dismissed, Sergeant.

132
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.960
- Hey.
- What's up?

133
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.320
You have my locket.

134
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.616
- I don't know what you...
- Give me my fucking locket!

135
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.600
- All right, girl. Let's go!
- Whoa... ladies!

136
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.800
Hey, take it easy.

137
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.216
- Lafayette, hand it over.
- Sarge, I don't have her...

138
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.680
Just give it the fuck back.

139
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.160
- I was just looking after it.
- Bullshit, Lafayette.

140
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.840
How many times, huh?

141
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560
Back to your post.

142
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.120
Whatever.

143
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.320
Is that all you've got?

144
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.800
Come on, then. Come on.

145
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.920
Guessing you didn't get that
out of a Christmas cracker.

146
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.040
Do you think I've lost the plot,
Sergeant?

147
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.040
I've seen my share of crazy shit.

148
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.640
I fell down the rabbit hole
a long time ago

149
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.760
so who am I to judge?

150
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.680
Come on, let's get you over to Wilks.

151
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.280
That major of yours
is quite the character.

152
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.720
Believe it or not,
he was a full-bird colonel

153
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.080
till a few years back.

154
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.200
We were ambushed south of Kandahar,
deep in Talib country.

155
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.320
Hit us with everything they had.

156
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.400
We got the order to fall back,
but the colonel kept pushing forward.

157
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.760
Somewhere in the chaos,
two men got separated.

158
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.760
Captured and killed.

159
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.440
Brass threw him under the bus

160
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.360
busted him down to major
and sent him here

161
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.640
to serve out his time.

162
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.520
Why here?

163
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.720
Well, because this is where
they shit-can

164
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.840
all the burnouts,
wash-outs, and fuck-ups.

165
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.320
Lafayette, as you found out,
is a kleptomaniac.

166
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.040
If it's shiny and expensive,
she'll take it.

167
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.360
Can't help herself.

168
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.680
Everett the rookie had
an accidental discharge in barracks.

169
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.080
Shot a guy in the foot.

170
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.400
Serano knocked up two girls
Stateside.

171
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.520
Both daughters of an unhappy general.

172
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.080
Wilks...
well, Wilks got hooked on the meds.

173
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.400
Don't worry. He's clean now.

174
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.280
I think.

175
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.680
So, I got rescued
by the Dirty Half-Dozen.

176
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.960
What's your story?

177
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.160
The two men we lost
were from my unit.

178
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.120
Finch took the heat, but...

179
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520
it was my fault.

180
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.200
Shit happens on the battlefield.

181
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.240
And in the air.

182
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.680
<i>This is Major Roy Finch.</i>

183
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.640
Put me through
to Colonel Eugene Harper

184
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.600
Military Intelligence, INSCOM.

185
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.360
Colonel Harper, been a while.

186
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.080
Yes, sir.

187
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.320
When you put me in command here

188
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.040
you asked me to report
any unusual activity

189
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.640
in the sector directly to you.

190
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.720
I suggest you check your e-mail.

191
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.920
I know a bullet wound when I see one.

192
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.760
And this is no fucking bullet wound.

193
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.240
It's gonna leave
a hell of a scar, Lieutenant.

194
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.000
Or is it Left-tenant?
I can never remember.

195
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800
You were there.

196
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.600
You saw it, too.
Why don't you say something?

197
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.920
Don't waste your breath.

198
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.800
I don't think he speaks
a word of English.

199
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.520
And don't get too close.

200
00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.400
Captain, you got a minute?

201
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.200
I'm not going anywhere.

202
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.080
Hold up there, Hookie.

203
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.000
Don't you know
it's a court-martial offense

204
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.400
to question a British officer
without another member

205
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.200
of Her Majesty's Forces present?

206
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.960
- It is?
- So far as you know.

207
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.600
Captain, Sergeant Oswald Jones.

208
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.800
His patrol stopped by
for a cup of tea and...

209
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.776
now we can't get rid of him.

210
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.120
It's the special relationship
and all that bollocks, see?

211
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.240
We provide some intel,
they supply us with brew.

212
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.680
No PG Tips, mind you,
but beggars can't be choosers.

213
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.040
And besides, the shit's
about to kick off 'round here.

214
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.960
Oh, we'd hate to miss the party.

215
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.360
You lads SAS?

216
00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720
Couldn't really say.

217
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.960
Heard you had a spot
of argy-bargy yourself.

218
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.640
That's one way of putting it.

219
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.840
That was some excellent
soldiering, ma'am.

220
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.880
Not bad for a jockey.

221
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.280
You're done. Get you up.

222
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.240
I'll take that as a compliment.

223
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.120
- How could I help you?
- Yeah, something's bugging me.

224
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.000
I know our AO pretty well

225
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.920
but there's nothing like this bunker
in any satellite images

226
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.360
any maps, anywhere.

227
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.600
Well, it would be hard to spot
from the air.

228
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.200
But it's there,
and it has been for quite a while.

229
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.280
The door was chained shut
with some kind of...

230
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.320
some kind of writing on it.

231
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.040
- Pass me that chart.
- Yeah.

232
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680
Here.

233
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.200
There you go.

234
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.840
- How'd you do that?
- Photographic memory.

235
00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.640
Don't know what it means, but...

236
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.600
- What is that?
- It looks like gobbledygook.

237
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.520
It's Russian.

238
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.160
It means "Do not open."

239
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.680
Would you look at that?

240
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.040
- He speaks Russian.
- And English.

241
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.040
Whatever she told you...

242
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800
it's worse.

243
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.760
Wait a second.

244
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.760
If this bunker is Soviet,
that's got to be 30 years old.

245
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.080
- More.
- Thirty years.

246
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.160
No way a human could live
down there for that long.

247
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.840
It's not human.

248
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.920
You mentioned seeing containers.

249
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.600
Yes. And every container
had one of those things inside.

250
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.440
It could be some kind of stasis.

251
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.240
What the hell were those Russkies
doing down there?

252
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.960
- Hold your fire.
- Jesus, Everett!

253
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.200
What kind of white-boy move was that?

254
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.160
You're gonna get your ass shot off
pulling shit like that.

255
00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.800
Thought you could use a coffee.

256
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.800
You can bring me all the cups
of coffee you want

257
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.680
it ain't gonna get you in my shorts.

258
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.040
It's just a cup of coffee.

259
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120
Bullshit.

260
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.920
Word is that pilot we picked up

261
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.880
saw some weird-ass creature
out there.

262
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.080
Are you fucking with me?

263
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.920
She's probably stir-crazy.

264
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440
It's the heat.

265
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.240
It's enough to send anyone
over the edge.

266
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.400
Back in North Carolina,
people talk about Bigfoot

267
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.360
like it's real as you and me.

268
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.760
They all crazy too?

269
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.200
Hell, yeah.

270
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.960
Evening, lads.

271
00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.200
How's it going, Taff?

272
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.720
Got a fresh brew on here
if you want one.

273
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800
Champion.

274
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.400
What other culinary delights
have we got in store, Bromhead?

275
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.560
Well, we've got an aperitif
of chicken curry

276
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.440
followed by chicken curry entrée

277
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.360
and for dessert, chicken curry sorbet
with lashings of chicken curry.

278
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.480
Compliments to the chef.

279
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.520
Hughes, you be Mum. Dish up.

280
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.360
You wanna tell us
what's going on there, Taff?

281
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.000
Yeah, what's the word
on the jockey, guv?

282
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.040
Just make sure your kit's in order.

283
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.920
We're helping on stag tonight.

284
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.680
Three-hour shifts.

285
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.040
We expecting trouble?

286
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.520
This is the Regiment, Bromhead,
we always expect trouble.

287
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200
Fuckers.

288
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.960
Patch me through to INSCOM,
Colonel Harper's office.

289
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.280
Colonel, Major Finch.
Did you read the report?

290
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.480
She makes for one hell
of a credible witness

291
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.560
don't you think?

292
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360
Oh, I have it.

293
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.280
But if you wanna get
your hands on it

294
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.360
you better tell me
what the hell is going on here.

295
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.800
So, what's your name?

296
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.520
Kabir Abdul Rahimi.

297
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.040
You shot me down, Kabir,
and killed my WSO.

298
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.520
No, I didn't. I'm just the driver.

299
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.320
I don't shoot anything.

300
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.960
I'm not a violent man.

301
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.120
Then you're hanging
with the wrong crowd, Kabir.

302
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640
Why were you with them?

303
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160
Why?

304
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.760
Do you think I have a choice, huh?

305
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.000
I must do it to protect my family.

306
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.080
If you are not with them,
then you are against them.

307
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160
And this...

308
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240
this cannot be.

309
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.200
You ever fancy a real man's sport,
you should have a crack at rugby.

310
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.520
You'd make a decent fullback,
I reckon.

311
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.240
Like the great JPR himself.

312
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
JPR?

313
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.440
JPR Williams.

314
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.600
The most fearless player
that ever lived.

315
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.680
The kind of man who would run toward
the bulls of Pamplona.

316
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.040
- Jonesy, Serano.
- Sarge.

317
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.576
I was just telling the man here

318
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.240
the difference
between rugby and football.

319
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.240
Well, American football, that is.

320
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.120
A sport in which the foot
rarely encounters the ball.

321
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.760
Unlike rugby, in which a player
is often kicked in the nuts.

322
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040
Fascinating.

323
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.720
Serano, you're up.

324
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800
Go relieve Everett.

325
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400
Sarge.

326
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.200
What do you...

327
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.240
what do you make of all this?

328
00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.200
Well, I don't know about you,
but I won't be sleeping tonight.

329
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.480
You and the boys stick around

330
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.320
or go where the storm carries you?

331
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.040
We are the storm, mate.

332
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.880
We'll hang around

333
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520
see what's occurring.

334
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.760
Past your bedtime, huh, Everett?

335
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.120
Why don't you get some sleep, huh?

336
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560
I got this.

337
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.640
That's mighty kind of you.

338
00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.960
And a...

339
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280
a word of advice

340
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.840
don't try so hard
with Lafayette, man.

341
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.800
She's not the needy type.

342
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.720
And you might want to take a shower.

343
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.440
Asshole.

344
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.440
Dude. Seriously, man. You've got...

345
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.320
What the...

346
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160
Serano?

347
00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.920
Quit screwing around, dude.

348
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.200
Fuckin' hell, Hughes.
What crawled up your arse and died?

349
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.920
He who smelt it, dealt it.

350
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.240
He who said the rhyme
committed the crime.

351
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.280
I blame
your fucking chicken curry, mate.

352
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.000
'Cept it ain't coming
from your direction.

353
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.560
Serano?

354
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.680
Holy shit.

355
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.680
Son of a bitch.

356
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Come on.

357
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.440
Show your fucking selves.

358
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.640
Sod this malarkey.

359
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.600
Contact!

360
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.400
It's here.

361
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.440
Contact front! Get to position!

362
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.080
O'Neal, south wall!

363
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.320
Hughes, man the 50 cal
and hold the gate.

364
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.440
- Use your infrared. Go... go!
- Wait up!

365
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.440
Lafayette, suppressing fire!

366
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.680
Serano, talk to me!

367
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.560
Serano's gone.
Something fucking took him.

368
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.040
What the fuck are we firing at?

369
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.160
Fucking shoot!

370
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.760
What's coming, Brommie?

371
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.080
Something's moving out there,
but I don't know what.

372
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.280
Shit the bed. Sinclair's bogeymen!

373
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.280
- What's that, Taff?
- Just shoot any fucker that moves!

374
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.840
Finish her, Travis!

375
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.800
Get to the south wall,
support O'Neal!

376
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.960
I don't want these fuckers
getting around back of us!

377
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.560
Lafayette, sit rep.

378
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.240
Multiple unknown targets
advancing from the north and west.

379
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.280
Fire over to the head!
Aim for the head!

380
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.200
No, look to the left!

381
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.320
The others got out.
They must have tracked me.

382
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.600
How can they do that?

383
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.520
Major?

384
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.960
Sergeant, report.

385
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.640
We're under attack, sir.

386
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.360
How can we be under attack?
I don't hear any incoming fire.

387
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.600
It's not insurgents, sir.

388
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.280
They don't sound like that.

389
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.120
Holy shit.

390
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.320
What are the rules of engagement?

391
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.240
Weapons free, Sergeant.
Kill anything that shrieks.

392
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.320
Copy that.

393
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.680
You still think I'm crazy, Lafayette?

394
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.240
I'll cut you some slack.

395
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.640
Fuck! Everett!

396
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.960
Son of a bitch!

397
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.440
Man down! Medic!

398
00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.280
Stay here.

399
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.920
Where the fuck is my sidearm?

400
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.536
With the rest
of the confiscated weapons in there.

401
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.440
Finch has the key. Sorry. Watch him.

402
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.800
Watch him do what? Watch me?

403
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.880
Command, this is Camp Cooper,
we are under attack.

404
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.480
Repeat. We...

405
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.080
we are under attack, come in.

406
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.120
Shit!

407
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.720
Hey, come on now, buddy.

408
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640
Come on, now.

409
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040
Freak!

410
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.800
What the flying fuck?

411
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.520
Jones, we need support
on the east wall!

412
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.200
Right you are, Hookie!

413
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.080
Keep at 'em, boyo!

414
00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.920
It's like a Friday night in Cardiff!

415
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.920
Fucking radgie!

416
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.160
I got no idea what you just said!

417
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.560
Come on, you toothy bastards!

418
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.160
You picked the wrong foxhole
to fuck with.

419
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440
I got you, come on.

420
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.960
Fuck. Shit, come on, man.

421
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.640
Fall back, now!

422
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.000
You heard the man! Move your arse!

423
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960
Shit.

424
00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.800
Peterson and Travis are down.
Where the fuck is O'Neill?

425
00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.240
They're inside the wire!

426
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.120
Fall back!

427
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.440
Hughes, on me! Come on!

428
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.520
Move, you fucking muppet!

429
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.600
Mad for it, you are!

430
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960
Shit!

431
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.280
No!

432
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.960
Fucking hell, Brommie,
your leg's on fire!

433
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800
Incoming!

434
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.640
Fuck!

435
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.160
Fucking Bennett!

436
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.160
All right, me old china,
you're coming with us.

437
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.800
- What?
- Fucking move. Shift it, come on.

438
00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.560
Shit. Sinclair.

439
00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.480
On me, on me!

440
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.640
Re-group! Fall back to the trench!

441
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.720
Come on.

442
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.680
Glad you could make it, Captain.

443
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760
What's the plan, Stan?

444
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.880
Park it, boyo,
and no playing silly buggers

445
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.080
or I'll slot you.

446
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.320
Where'd the fuck they'd go?

447
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.000
They're sneaky bastards, I reckon.

448
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.440
All right.

449
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.360
Lafayette, fall back to the armory.

450
00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.720
Jones, I need some covering fire.

451
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960
Covering for what?

452
00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.200
I'm going for the major.

453
00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.560
Wilks, you with me.

454
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280
Fuck's sake.

455
00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.680
Sod this for a game of soldiers.

456
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.720
Wind your fuckin' neck in, Brommie,
and shift it.

457
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560
Flash-bang!

458
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.960
Batter up, you son of a bitch.

459
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.040
You about done there, Major?

460
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.480
The fuck. Who's got the key?

461
00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760
I got a key.

462
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.280
Easy, tiger.
Let's not shoot the ammunition.

463
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.776
I've got previous
with this sort of thing.

464
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.280
Just keep those bastards off my back.

465
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.120
You okay? Your head is bleeding.

466
00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.800
Let it bleed.

467
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.080
Base is compromised.
Six men are down.

468
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.600
We're falling back to the armory.

469
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.480
Sergeant, take command.

470
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.040
You don't need any dead weight.

471
00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.680
Nice speech, now let's go!

472
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.040
Come here. Come here.

473
00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.920
God damn it, leave me!

474
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.760
Major, we're getting you back,
come on.

475
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.280
Still got it.

476
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.520
Nice work, Brommie.

477
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.160
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

478
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.000
Someone is really
taking the piss now!

479
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.320
Come on. Get in. Get in there!

480
00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480
Here they come.

481
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.280
Go for the kisser,
that's the sweet spot.

482
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.360
Contact, Corporal, take it out!

483
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.960
Brommie, on me, covering fire!

484
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.240
What the fuck?

485
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.560
I'll be damned.
Go on, knock its fucking head off!

486
00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.600
Smile for the fucking camera.

487
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.680
Move! Move your fucking ass
and get in the hole!

488
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.760
- Get in!
- Incoming!

489
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.000
Go... go!

490
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.640
Lock the fucking door! Lock it!

491
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.160
Think they've had enough?

492
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.480
You want to stick
your head out and see?

493
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.856
At least we've given them
something to think about.

494
00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.440
Yeah, take-out.

495
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.800
Nothing quite like a kebab in a box
to round off the night.

496
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.480
How's he doing?

497
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.040
Out cold, but he's alive.

498
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.200
What are we gonna do, Sarge?

499
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.240
All we can do.

500
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.520
Hang tight, wait for daylight.

501
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.640
See if our odds improve.

502
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.560
Caught this one
trying to make a run for it.

503
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.360
Can you blame him?

504
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.400
No.

505
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.040
Still can't trust him, though.

506
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.160
He saved my life quick enough.

507
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.640
We had one of those bastards
bang to rights

508
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.280
but he didn't fire. Why's that?

509
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.600
Why don't you ask him?

510
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.480
He speaks English.

511
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.840
Kabir, isn't it?

512
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.400
If you got something to tell us,
now's the time.

513
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.280
Or would you rather
take your chances out there...

514
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400
with them?

515
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.800
I wasn't even born when the Russians
invaded my country.

516
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.200
The people of my village said

517
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.480
they knew
that the invasion was coming

518
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.960
because a star had fallen to Earth
and shook the ground.

519
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.480
They believed it was a sign from God,
to begin our holy war.

520
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.360
So my mother taught me
to learn the ways of our enemy

521
00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.640
<i>while my father fought
with the Mujahideen.</i>

522
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.120
And by winter of 1988

523
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.440
the Afghan forces
had begun to turn the tide.

524
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.881
We had the Stinger missiles
and could shoot their aircraft

525
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.920
from the sky.

526
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200
Tell me about it.

527
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.520
For the first time in nine years
there was hope.

528
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.240
But that was when it began.

529
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.840
First one man disappeared,
then another, and then women too.

530
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.160
Always at night.

531
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.440
Sometimes we found bodies mauled,
like a beast attacks its prey.

532
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.760
We thought it was a wolf or a bear.

533
00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.960
So my father led a hunt
to kill the beast

534
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:46.360
but as suddenly as it began,
when the Soviets withdrew, it ended.

535
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.240
We lost 46 villagers...

536
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.720
including my father.

537
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.840
He never returned from the hunt.

538
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.680
Serano, Hughes, they're all gone.

539
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.720
Just blood trails, heading west.

540
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.400
Where they came from.

541
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.440
Why would they take the bodies?

542
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.640
Something un-godly, I expect.

543
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.240
Lafayette, report.

544
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.120
No movement. Coast is clear, Sarge.

545
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.880
All right, keep a lookout.

546
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.880
Hey.

547
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.600
How you holding up?

548
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.240
Oh, your know, nothing a cup of tea
and a biscuit wouldn't fix.

549
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.480
Is that British understatement?

550
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.000
My old man used to say

551
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.840
if you don't want life
to bite you in the ass

552
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.000
you better learn
to kick it in the teeth.

553
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.160
Quite the motivational speaker,
your dad.

554
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.320
Oh, yeah. That's one way to put it.

555
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.280
You got family back home?

556
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.440
No.

557
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.520
I want to, but it's kinda hard
in this job, you know?

558
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.120
Three tours,
I've been dodging triple-A

559
00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.320
without so much as a blink.

560
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.040
This is the first time I'm thinking,
I might not make it home.

561
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.640
Hey. You better come see this.

562
00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.200
He's a heavy son of a bitch.

563
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.280
Come on.

564
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.880
Lay it down there. Come on.

565
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.400
Found it behind the generator.

566
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.880
Only corpse they left behind.

567
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.320
Man, that thing is ripe.

568
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.560
Ugly bastard, too.

569
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.280
That's a face
only a mother could love.

570
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.200
What the hell
are we dealing with, Doc?

571
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.280
Like I should know?

572
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
You're all we've got.

573
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.280
That's some commendation.

574
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.880
Yeah, send a doctor in. He'll do it.

575
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.200
I need my equipment.

576
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.560
Oh, yeah.

577
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.880
His teeth are in rows
and retractable.

578
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.200
Like a shark.

579
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.320
It's got thick skin.

580
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.360
Like body armor.

581
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.840
Wow, tough as Kevlar.

582
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.800
Well, no wonder
they're so hard to kill.

583
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.680
So how come it's melting?

584
00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.720
A reaction to the sunlight.

585
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.200
I figure its DNA isn't used
to the same levels of UV

586
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.360
we're accustomed to.

587
00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.400
So sunlight hurts it...

588
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.080
like an albino.

589
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.960
Or a fucking vampire.

590
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.560
Well, let's be honest.

591
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.680
I really need to take a look inside.

592
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.576
Now why would you want to do
a thing like that?

593
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.640
We don't have a choice.

594
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.520
What do you need?

595
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.640
Tool kit.

596
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.600
Can someone give me a hand here?

597
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.080
Get in there, Brommie.
Fill yer boots.

598
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.160
Oh, fuck's sake!

599
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.240
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

600
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280
Oh, my God.

601
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.640
What's wrong?

602
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.720
Everything's wrong.

603
00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.240
These are human organs.

604
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.640
No, you've lost me, mate.

605
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.440
One minute they aren't human,
and now they are?

606
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.280
- Which one is it?
- It's both.

607
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.920
I owe you an apology, Sinclair.

608
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.600
Army Intelligence...

609
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.600
they've had eyes on this sector
for decades.

610
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:17.440
They've long suspected
a Soviet black site

611
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.920
in the mountains near here

612
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.400
but they could never verify it
until yesterday

613
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.520
when you walked
right into it and found this.

614
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.920
I don't know what the fuck's on here

615
00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.360
but they figure it's worth enough
to tell me everything they know

616
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.000
so long as I keep it safe.

617
00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.080
It seems the Soviets
found a way to integrate

618
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.560
foreign DNA into a human host.

619
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.440
Foreign DNA? You mean, like, French?

620
00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.200
I mean foreign to the Earth.

621
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.400
Is this the bit where we all
get killed for knowing too much?

622
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.760
We already know too much.

623
00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.840
- So don't sweat it.
- Shit.

624
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.920
In December '79,
an object of unknown origin

625
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.320
entered Earth's atmosphere
over Siberia

626
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.120
and crashed
somewhere in the Hindu Kush

627
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.440
not too far from here.

628
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.680
The falling star.

629
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.440
Yeah.

630
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.440
<i>The Russians sent a team
to investigate</i>

631
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.360
<i>and found
it was a craft of some sort...</i>

632
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.840
<i>and something was inside of it.</i>

633
00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.520
Something that the Soviet government
wanted so badly

634
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.240
they invaded this country
to keep it for themselves.

635
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080
What are you saying?

636
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.880
The entire Russian invasion
of Afghanistan was a smokescreen?

637
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.480
Holy shit. That's big.

638
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.360
The Russians had their own Roswell.

639
00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.880
The rabbit hole
gets deeper and deeper.

640
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.520
You said there was more.

641
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.440
How many are we talking about?

642
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.480
There's an army down there.

643
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.840
Last night, they were just probing,
testing our strengths

644
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.040
learning our weaknesses.

645
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.080
Means tonight they'll be back
to finish the job.

646
00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.536
So why don't we
just load up the Hummer

647
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.616
and get the fuck out of here?

648
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.120
Through 70mi of hostile country?

649
00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.320
With the fuel we've got left
we'd be lucky to make it halfway.

650
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.680
And on foot...

651
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.360
insurgents will be on us
like flies on shit.

652
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.800
Like it or not, we're in this fight.

653
00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.040
All of us.

654
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.720
Now, my life may not be worth
a plugged nickel

655
00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.520
but it's my duty to protect yours.

656
00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.840
And I swear to you...

657
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.280
when these motherfuckers
storm our walls

658
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.320
I will defend these ramparts.

659
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.640
And I will shed my blood with yours

660
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.600
and I will hold this position
to the last fucking cartridge.

661
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.920
Now let's show these fuckers
what we're made...

662
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560
Fuck!

663
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.760
What the hell?

664
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.240
Somebody kill that fuckin' bitch!

665
01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920
I can't get a fucking...

666
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.920
You get 'em, Hookie!

667
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.920
Stand clear!

668
01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.240
Hit the deck!

669
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200
Major!

670
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.080
Major.

671
01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.960
How's that for a voluntary discharge?

672
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360
Finch!

673
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.640
Finch.

674
01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.720
Is everybody else okay?

675
01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960
Yeah.

676
01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.400
Just peachy.

677
01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.920
That was some fucked-up shit.

678
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.920
No.

679
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.120
Anybody got a problem with this?

680
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.080
He's all right in my book.

681
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.720
Oh, bollocks!

682
01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.160
SATCOM is shot to fuck.

683
01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.160
What about the radio in the Hummer?

684
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.080
The antenna was damaged last night.

685
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.880
It works,
but it doesn't have the range.

686
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.200
- Corporal, how we doing on ammo?
- Not much.

687
01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.920
About 50 rounds for the M4s

688
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.720
a handful of mags for the sidearms,
three belts for the 50-cal

689
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.320
and a case of C4.

690
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.400
Shit.

691
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.200
I've seen more firepower
at a Saudi wedding.

692
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.200
Hey...

693
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.080
- Still on Planet Earth?
- I'm okay.

694
01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.800
That was pretty fucking sick.

695
01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.680
It tried to suck your brains out.

696
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.000
Not just my brains. My thoughts,
like it was training my mind.

697
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.760
To learn the ways of their enemy.

698
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.816
We still have one more trick
up our sleeve.

699
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840
Which is?

700
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.040
I know where they live.

701
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.040
Kabir, you're free to go.

702
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.320
If you don't mind,
I would like to join you.

703
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040
Good man.

704
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.480
This is personal for you, isn't it?

705
01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.360
This knife belonged to my father.

706
01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.080
And when I came of age,
I swore an oath

707
01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.720
that one day
I would avenge his death.

708
01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.320
That day has come.

709
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.240
My son lost his father too.

710
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.920
Car accident a year ago.

711
01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.240
It's never easy for a mother
to raise a child alone...

712
01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.520
but my mother never left my side.

713
01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.640
What the fuck am I doing here?

714
01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.760
Fighting to get home.

715
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.840
Heads up.

716
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Found this in my shit.

717
01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.360
Looked like your size.

718
01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.480
Borrowed?

719
01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.680
Hell, no.

720
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.000
Ladies, gentlemen...

721
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.120
let's boogie.

722
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.360
You jammy twat. I wish I'd said that.

723
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.960
<i>We get in quick and clean.</i>

724
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.320
<i>Load the C4 in the caboose,
cut the cable</i>

725
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.880
<i>drop the package down their throats</i>

726
01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.800
<i>and blow this place
back to the Stone Age.</i>

727
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.640
<i>Piece of pie. Right, Sinclair?</i>

728
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.360
<i>It's cake. Piece of cake.</i>

729
01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.960
You okay?

730
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.120
Oh, no.

731
01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.680
I don't like heights.

732
01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.520
A pilot that's afraid of heights?

733
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.360
Now I've heard everything.

734
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.200
I don't much like the smell
of sweaty armpits, and crotch rot

735
01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.040
but here I am.

736
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960
Fair play.

737
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.080
C4 is armed. We're good to go.

738
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.880
All right, everyone, fall back.

739
01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.040
Sinclair.

740
01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.440
Your locket.

741
01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.400
Hook!

742
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.560
Fuck!

743
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.320
We gotta go.

744
01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.000
Take cover, everyone.

745
01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.600
Fire in the hole.

746
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.600
Move your ass, girl.

747
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800
<i>Sinclair?</i>

748
01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.840
Wait, wait! It's Hook. He's alive.

749
01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:15.000
<i>- Sinclair, do you copy?</i>
- This is Sinclair. Where are you?

750
01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.880
I don't know. Doesn't matter.

751
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.480
You have to complete the mission.

752
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.280
<i>Blow this place up,
and get them out of there.</i>

753
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360
Wait, what about you?

754
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.320
Shit happens on the battlefield.

755
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.440
Get home to your son.

756
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.960
And tell him I left you to die?

757
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.720
I don't think so.

758
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.440
Wilks... man the winch.

759
01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.840
You're not seriously thinking
about going down there?

760
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.240
If Kabir is right
and they are siphoning our minds...

761
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.560
it's a cinch they know our moves
before we even make 'em.

762
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.680
I'm going in, alone if I have to

763
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.240
'cause I know Hook
would do the same for me

764
01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.560
or any of you.

765
01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.000
All right, Jockey.

766
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.640
I'm sold.

767
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720
You're both nuts.

768
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.560
That would make three of us.

769
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.520
You wouldn't want to miss
the party, would you?

770
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.480
Bastards, the lot of ya.

771
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.880
Hook, if you can hear me...

772
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.640
we're coming in to get you.

773
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.560
Sinclair, do not come back for me.

774
01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.440
I repeat, do not come back...

775
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320
Wilks.

776
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.480
You hear the signal,
you get us out fast.

777
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.320
Got it. Don't be late.

778
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.240
Okay, cover your ears,
open your mouths and hold on tight.

779
01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.760
Three, two, one.

780
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.680
Hold.

781
01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880
<i>Touch down.</i>

782
01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.920
If they didn't know we were coming,
they do now.

783
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.120
<i>All personnel in range of this signal</i>

784
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.720
<i>evacuate immediately.</i>

785
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.480
<i>We are at T-minus 20 minutes
and counting.</i>

786
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560
Hello?

787
01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440
Hello?

788
01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.480
Hello? Fuck!

789
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.920
<i>Sinclair, we got a big problem.</i>

790
01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.960
I just picked up an alert on SATCOMs

791
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.600
telling anyone who's listening
to evacuate this sector right now.

792
01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680
Copy that.

793
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.040
- How could they know the location?
- Every Humvee has a transponder.

794
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.360
We led them straight to us.

795
01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.600
It sounds like a missile strike.

796
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.760
Whatever it is,
it's 20 minutes and counting.

797
01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.640
We gonna stand here and stare,
or do this shit?

798
01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.800
Corporal, with me.

799
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.640
Kabir, Jones, watch the rear.

800
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.320
Brommie, you stay here
and hold the fort.

801
01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720
Right you are, Taff.

802
01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.680
Hook, come on.

803
01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.920
Spread out, stay alert.
We've got ten minutes.

804
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.280
Hook, do you copy?

805
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.400
Hook, do you copy?

806
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120
Hook?

807
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.920
What did they do?

808
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.680
These were my people.

809
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.480
No fucking way.

810
01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.800
Sinclair. What's your 20?

811
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.640
Thank fuck. We're in the lab.

812
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.480
Follow the biohazard signs.

813
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.920
Sinclair.

814
01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.600
<i>Hook, take a gun with you.</i>

815
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640
Shit.

816
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.960
<i>- Follow the biohazard signs.</i>
- I'm on my way.

817
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.440
I've got company!

818
01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.920
<i>T-minus 17 minutes and counting.</i>

819
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.600
Shit.

820
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.280
- Coming in hot!
- You might want to duck!

821
01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.040
Empty.

822
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.240
Empty.

823
01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560
Empty.

824
01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.160
I keep some for emergency.

825
01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.600
They're hatching.

826
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.960
Here we go!

827
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.080
Come on in. you motherfuckers!

828
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200
Fuck.

829
01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.120
<i>Alarm</i>

830
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.480
Let's not hang around, eh?

831
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.120
This is why they took you alive.

832
01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.800
They knew I'd come for you.

833
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.960
Because they've read my mind.

834
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.520
Bastards laid an ambush.

835
01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.440
Back to the elevator, now!

836
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.640
Lafayette, let's go!

837
01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.136
You better get a move on, Hookie.

838
01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.560
Yeah, nice try.

839
01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.320
Fuck off, now. There's a good lad.

840
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.680
You heard the sergeant! Let's move!

841
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.080
I'll be right behind you, Jockey.

842
01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.680
Go!

843
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.440
Go!

844
01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520
Motherfucker!

845
01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.800
- Which way?
- To the left.

846
01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.120
Fast.

847
01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.000
Right. It's right here.

848
01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.000
- Right. Make a right!
- Go.

849
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.560
Motherfuckers don't stop...

850
01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160
Jammed. It's jammed!

851
01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.680
Go, go.

852
01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.560
Where's Jones?

853
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.640
Buying us time.

854
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Where's Lafayette?

855
01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.240
- Kabir!
- She was right behind us.

856
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.120
- I'm going back for her.
- No, you're not.

857
01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.360
She's mine.

858
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.680
If I'm not back in five,
get the hell outta here.

859
01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.640
Hook.

860
01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.920
We have to go. Now!

861
01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.480
We fucking wait for them!

862
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.120
All right, motherfucker.

863
01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.240
Let's go...

864
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.440
Fuck.

865
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840
Bollocks to this!

866
01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.240
Wilks, pick us up now!

867
01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440
No.

868
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.120
- This is not the plan!
- No fucking shit!

869
01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360
Wilks! Wilks!

870
01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.320
<i>Wilks, pick us up now!</i>

871
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.720
<i>Wilks! Wilks!</i>

872
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360
Fuck it!

873
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.080
Eat your fucking heart out, JPR!

874
01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.760
Get down!

875
01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.720
<i>T-minus 13 minutes and counting.</i>

876
01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.760
Fuck!

877
01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.720
It's jammed solid. Fuck!

878
01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.320
Wilks? Shut it down.
Shut it down now!

879
01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.400
<i>T-minus ten minutes and counting.</i>

880
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.400
<i>T-minus eight minutes and counting.</i>

881
01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.720
You motherfuckers!

882
01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800
Fuck!

883
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.880
No!

884
01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.200
Fuck, no!

885
01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960
Go!

886
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.480
Joke's on you, assholes.

887
01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.040
<i>T-minus four minutes and counting.</i>

888
01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.360
Looks like that rabbit hole
swallowed us both this time.

889
01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.880
Still want to kick life in the teeth?

890
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320
Fuck, yeah.

891
01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.880
May I?

892
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.200
Hold tight.

893
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.320
Fuck.

894
01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.120
You with me?

895
01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.880
Can you cut it finer next time?

896
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.480
You were saying?

897
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.440
<i>T-minus one minute and counting.</i>

898
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.640
<i>Thirty, 29, 28, 27</i>

899
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.280
<i>26, 25, 24, 23, 22...</i>

900
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.000
<i>18, 17, 16, 15...</i>

901
01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.480
<i>13, 12, 11, ten, nine...</i>

902
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.520
Let's go... let's go!

903
01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.200
<i>Six, five, four, three, two, one.</i>

904
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.200
Holy shit.

905
01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.760
What the fuck was that?

906
01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.320
That was someone covering their ass.

907
01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.680
Colonel Harper, this is Spearhead.
The asset is gone.

908
01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.160
<i>Well, that's a damn shame.</i>

909
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.056
<i>But these things
have a habit of turning up.</i>

910
01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.240
<i>Return to base, Spearhead.</i>

911
01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.640
<i>Harper out.</i>

912
01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.560
Better get moving.

913
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.800
That blast'll wake up every insurgent
for a hundred miles.

914
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.040
What you got there?

915
01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.680
A present, from Lafayette.

916
01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280
Come on.

917
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.360
No time for a moment.

918
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.640
Get me to a hotel.

919
01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.280
Get me a milkshake.

920
01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.240
- Take a bath.
- Will you shut up, Wilks?

921
01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.480
Oh, come on.

922
01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.160
- Tell me you're joking.
- Wish I were.

923
01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.960
Hey.

924
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.200
- Quit fooling around, Sarge.
- Wanna get out and push?

925
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.760
You're beginning to worry me.

926
01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.880
For fuck's sake.

927
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.360
Come on, baby.

928
01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.880
Don't let me down.
