1
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,642
There's only one here.

2
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,519
They were forged as a pair.

3
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,355
We'll keep looking for it.
It must be buried elsewhere.

4
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,689
Elsewhere?

5
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,943
Like where?

6
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,627
Kamala! Are you doing
your homework, beta?

7
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,879
Yeah! Science!

8
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,431
Boom!

9
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,475
Enter, Kamala Khan.

10
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,726
Ready for...

11
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,688
Captain Marvel.

12
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:09,940
She needs my help.

13
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,609
Shine on, baby.

14
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,282
Why are hands so hard to draw?

15
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,869
Okay, Ms. Marvel arrives,
and just in time...

16
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,704
...'cause even the Avengers need backup,
ya know?

17
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,414
Wham! Kapow!

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,335
This is my chance!

19
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,214
Pow!

20
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,884
Boom!

21
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,595
Not bad, kid.

22
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,764
What's your name?

23
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,849
Ms. Marvel.

24
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
Dude.

25
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,393
Twinsies!

26
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,813
Hey, you wanna go party with the Avengers?

27
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,648
Uh... Yeah!

28
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,984
Can you fly?

29
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,112
No, but I can do this!

30
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,782
Kamala! Don't make me come up there!

31
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,829
-That does not sound like science to me.
-Okay.

32
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,813
You don't remember anything?

33
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,815
I see...

34
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,359
flashes.

35
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,654
Little moments.

36
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,823
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

37
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,076
maybe it'll all make sense.

38
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,839
You stole me from my home,
my family, my friends.

39
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,215
Lieutenant Trouble.

40
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,843
-Higher, further, faster, baby.
-That's right.

41
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,346
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

42
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,932
The war, the lies.

43
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,725
All of it.

44
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:09,935
You can't do this.

45
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,728
I'll be back before you know it.

46
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,522
I could fly up and meet you halfway.

47
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,066
Only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

48
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,309
Come here, Goosey.

49
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,105
Incoming call from Nick Fury.

50
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,523
You expecting a call?

51
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,942
Maybe we just send it to voice mail.

52
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,239
Nick Fury...

53
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,950
my favorite one-eyed man of intrigue.

54
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,118
Carol Danvers.

55
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,162
Prodigal child of the Milky Way.

56
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,538
How goes it out there?

57
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:12,956
Thriving.

58
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,584
What the hell was that?

59
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,461
-Goose?
-Yeah.

60
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,254
What about you?

61
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,506
How are you doing?

62
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,009
What do you know about the surge
in the jump point system a few hours ago?

63
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,929
I didn't notice anything unusual.

64
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,555
I'll take a look now.

65
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,848
It rattled the whole system.

66
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,475
We're trying to get a handle on
what happened.

67
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,018
The entire network was affected?

68
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,229
Yeah. End to end.

69
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,897
Thankfully, our neural network team...

70
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,150
was able to trace the origin back to
MB-418.

71
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,694
-You're in the neighborhood, right?
-Yeah.

72
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,363
Can you check it out?

73
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,115
-I'm on it.
-Appreciate you.

74
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,160
Monica and her team
will send more intel as they acquire it.

75
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,912
Monica?

76
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,039
What's she doing there?
I thought that she was on Earth.

77
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,458
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

78
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,961
And she's not that
little kid you remember.

79
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,938
So, do we think that
we can finish this before dinner?

80
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,356
Yeah. I don't think we're gonna fix it

81
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,067
in time to get a reading
on the jump point.

82
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,654
But I do know someone with superpowers
who could.

83
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,239
Oh.

84
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,825
Fine. I'll go.

85
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,869
You guys head in
and check the status of the network.

86
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,955
We've gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.

87
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,373
Aye, aye, Captain.

88
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,696
Fury...

89
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,406
I think I found something.

90
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,825
Communications override.

91
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,785
Captain Rambeau. Spacewalk.

92
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,120
Connected.

93
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:16,997
Rambeau...

94
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,415
what the hell are you doin'?

95
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,586
Seems the surge has had
some residual effect on the jump point.

96
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,338
I'm gonna get you some readings, Fury.

97
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,380
Mon...

98
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,090
-Hello?
-Monica.

99
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,258
Hello?

100
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,850
Was that Monica?

101
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,685
-Aunt Carol?
-Fury...

102
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,979
-was that Monica?
-Why, you wanna talk to her?

103
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,524
I don't think I'm in the best...

104
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,401
position to... I... I don't...

105
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,819
I don't wanna...

106
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:48,820
Look...

107
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,239
I don't wanna talk to her like this.

108
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,449
-Not after all this time.
-You know...

109
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,952
-eventually you're gonna have to talk to her.
-I know.

110
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,036
I know, but...

111
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,413
let's save the family reunions
till I'm back inside.

112
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,550
I think I found the source of the surge.

113
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,510
What are you seeing?

114
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,807
It's a jump point,
but it's not closing. Like...

115
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,851
it's stuck.

116
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:19,977
Danvers.

117
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,075
Danvers.

118
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,244
Danvers!

119
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,377
The jump point's still leaking energy.

120
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,045
-Captain Rambeau?
-Hello?

121
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,132
-Hello?
-Monica.

122
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,308
Beautiful.

123
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,344
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

124
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,976
Stop spinning, stop spinning, stop spinning,
please!

125
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,486
It's Nick Fury! Hey!

126
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,863
How did you... Oh, wow.

127
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm Kamala Khan.
No, sorry, I'm Ms. Marvel, actually.

128
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,701
But I'm from Jersey City and I...

129
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,995
Oh, no, I don't have my mask on.

130
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,206
Is this an Avengers test?

131
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,000
Who the hell are you?

132
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,156
Hi.

133
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,366
Really good living room.

134
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,871
-Kamala?
-Kamala?

135
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,547
What did you do to me?

136
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,966
-What is Dar-Benn doing?
-It's too late.

137
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,844
The Supremor's already on Tarnax.

138
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,846
You can't stop this.

139
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,264
Watch me.

140
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,113
Fury. It's the Kree.

141
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,073
They're going after the Skrulls on Tarnax.

142
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,410
Now, hold on.
Do not go in swinging.

143
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,913
-This is a peace and reconciliation tour.
-Fury.

144
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,831
-I got this.
-Carol...

145
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,086
So, I switched with someone
named Kamala Khan?

146
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,255
Yeah.
She seemed to be as confused as you are.

147
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,466
Well, there's nothing in her power-set
about teleportation.

148
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,634
Enough about her.

149
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,261
I wanna know what happened
to you on MB-418.

150
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,138
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,641
Let me preface this by saying
I'm not really sure. But...

152
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,894
I did not break my closet door, okay?
I was in space.

153
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,564
-Oh, so it broke itself?
-No, no, no. See, I disappeared.

154
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,691
So maybe Captain Marvel broke it.

155
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,237
-What?
-Yes, your friend, Captain Marvel.

156
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,280
She was walking up and down
our living room...

157
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,448
and now you come back...

158
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:05,369
-waltzing in with no apologies.
-I'm sorry, Captain Marvel was in our house?

159
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,372
Is Captain Marvel pressuring you in any way?

160
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,125
Look, I understand that she's
an important figure and all that...

161
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,418
but you don't have to do as she says.

162
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,671
No, no, they're clearly working together.

163
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,381
-Look at her face. Look at her smile.
-Aamir, stop it.

164
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,633
-She's being super secretive as always.
-Aamir, stop picking on your sister.

165
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,843
-Look at her.
-Muneeba.

166
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,469
Kamala, are you lying again?

167
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,555
-Just tell me if you're involved or...
-My daughter has said she's not lying.

168
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,722
-Kamala.
-Looks like she's having...

169
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:26,932
-so much fun.
-Muneeba...

170
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,433
-She's bad at keeping secrets.
-Oh, my God! It's happening!

171
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,735
Approaching Tarnax.

172
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,324
Warning.

173
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,909
Kree ship detected.

174
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,792
This is not what we agreed, Dar-Benn.

175
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,169
Supremor Dar-Benn.

176
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,295
The Skrull...

177
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,673
have been scattered
to every corner of the universe.

178
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,052
Made refugees wherever we go, and still...

179
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,765
we came into these negotiations
in good faith.

180
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,767
I hear you, Dro'ge.

181
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:57,272
I, perhaps more than anyone, understand what
you and your people have been through.

182
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,651
After my predecessor was destroyed...

183
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,070
heretics rose up to fill the void.

184
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,617
The Civil War has polluted our skies.
My people cannot breathe.

185
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,621
Our sun is dying.

186
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,374
Hala is out of time.

187
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,126
I hope we can rebuild together.

188
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,381
So much so that I'm willing
to put our ancient animosities behind us.

189
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,176
And give you a chance to protect your people.

190
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,304
To stop running.

191
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,436
The Skrull will take their rightful place
in the Kree Empire.

192
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,482
And I will aid in their relocation.

193
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,150
-Relocation?
-What?

194
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,695
-What?
-What is the meaning of this?

195
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:50,117
I would hate for your people to suffocate
when I strip the atmosphere.

196
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,345
It's the Annihilator!

197
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,486
Oh, my God!

198
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,334
-What the hell is going on?
-Yes, what the hell is going on?

199
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,336
I was on some freaky spaceship
and then I teleported here.

200
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,462
I don't know if that's my new power.

201
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,756
-And then this freaking cat ate a man.
-How can a cat eat a man, Kamala?

202
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:46,840
I don't know. It has tentacles...

203
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:47,966
-and it ate a man.
-What tentacles, Kamala?

204
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,092
-I don't know.
-Where are the tentacles?

205
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,511
It comes out of his mouth,
and they're...

206
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,596
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

207
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,224
Oh, my God,
it's happening again!

208
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,065
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Kamala, who are they?

209
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,735
Please run.

210
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,450
How did you get here,
and how're you involved in this?

211
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,120
-The Kree jury-rigged a wormhole on MB-418.
-You mean like a jump point?

212
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,791
-I don't know. But I touched it and then I...
-Why'd you do that?

213
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,417
Because it was glowing and mysterious.

214
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,963
Okay, new rule, no more touching shit.
Especially glowing, mysterious shit.

215
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,673
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of
negative energy from you...

216
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,800
and I don't like it. That's not the point.
The point is...

217
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,095
is that it was siphoning off
the atmosphere. And it did this!

218
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,388
Scissors beat paper.

219
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,975
Fury! There was, like,
energy that went around my hand. Focus.

220
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,560
Okay, maybe if I do this.

221
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,776
Annihilator.

222
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:48,986
I don't like that name.

223
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,437
-Friends of yours?
-Hi.

224
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,173
Annihilator!

225
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,945
Annihilator!

226
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:45,894
Aamir, get him!

227
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,646
Get him! Hit him!

228
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,538
Yusuf!

229
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:16,216
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

230
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,609
Kamala, are you okay?

231
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:39,948
Fury!

232
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,702
I think I'm getting teleported whenever I
channel any kind of radiant...

233
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,789
I think I switch when I use my powers.

234
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,124
Strong theory.

235
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,383
Strong theory.

236
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,803
Our tests keep generating the same result.

237
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,391
With each new jump point,
this band becomes more unstable.

238
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,977
I strongly suggest we wait
for the second band.

239
00:21:58,735 --> 00:21:59,736
Oi.

240
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,115
Hi, again.

241
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,076
So sorry about earlier.

242
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,828
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

243
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,122
Did I get in?

244
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,667
-Is this the new iPad? I haven't seen it yet.
-They wish!

245
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:14,793
-All right. Come on, let's go.
-I know. Wait...

246
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,754
if this is all top secret information,
why is it on a clear case?

247
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:18,755
Well...

248
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,592
just... swipe it a little bit... Hi.

249
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,678
-Okay.
-Can you believe it? They have intel on me.

250
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:25,929
On me!

251
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:27,890
I am intel.

252
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,266
Look at you!

253
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,853
Hey, what does S.A.B.E.R. stand for?

254
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,813
Strategic Aerospace Biophysics...

255
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,566
-and Exolinguistic Response.
-That's classified.

256
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:38,859
Sorry.

257
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,403
"Hard Light powers,"
yes.

258
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,864
-"Noor..."
-Okay, but why do you have intel on her?

259
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,782
Is there some sort of surveillance on us?

260
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,160
-"Surveillance" is a strong word.
-Well, ma'am...

261
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,288
your daughter is the hero
that saved Jersey City.

262
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,499
So, of course we would have intel
on someone like her. And you're also...

263
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,085
-electromagnetically altered.
-What does that mean?

264
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,838
Oh, it just means that we both have...

265
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,757
light-based powers.

266
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,218
What's your code name?

267
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,802
Oh, I don't have a code name.

268
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,346
-We'll workshop it.
-No, thank you.

269
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,181
Aunt Carol...

270
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,059
Captain Marvel also has light-based powers.

271
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,685
It's probably not a coincidence.

272
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,772
Not to mention the two of you
came into direct contact...

273
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,607
with some malfunctioning jump points.

274
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,778
I still cannot believe that Captain Marvel
was here and I didn't even get to meet her.

275
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,363
You know, we're supposed to be
all, like "twinsies!" you know.

276
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,282
We have the same name.
I would obviously, then...

277
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,535
I don't know, I would just give her
the letter I wrote for her...

278
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,620
and we would go out for lunch,
and then it would just...

279
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,623
Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

280
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,252
I said that Captain Marvel...

281
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,170
can absorb light energy.

282
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,505
I can see it.

283
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,882
And you, you can turn light...

284
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,509
into physical matter.

285
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,094
Which I have never heard of.

286
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,679
-But my working theory...
-I could totally show you.

287
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:49,972
No!

288
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,225
What the...

289
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:58,564
Hi.

290
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,524
Hi.

291
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,694
Nah, they don't seem related.

292
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,656
Whatever, Yusuf. Families are complicated.

293
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:13,120
Monica, you wanna fill Carol in
on your working theory?

294
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:14,705
Yeah.

295
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:16,748
Hi, Captain Marvel.

296
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,961
It is so good to see you,
Lieutenant Trouble.

297
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,171
You too.

298
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,964
And it's Captain Rambeau now.

299
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,134
Right. Sorry.

300
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:31,680
So, what's new?

301
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,140
-Where's my sister?
-Yeah.

302
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:37,561
I'm thinking that our joint exposure
to these unsteady jump points...

303
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:40,856
and our susceptibility to
electromagnetic energy...

304
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:44,401
-has temporarily entangled our world-lines.
-Yeah, that, right there.

305
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,989
Entanglement.
Our light powers are entangled.

306
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:52,034
So, we switch places
whenever we use them at the same time.

307
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,036
-Which would mean Kamala...
-When did you get powers?

308
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,039
I walked through
a radiation shielding barrier...

309
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,333
of a witch hex
and now I can manipulate and see...

310
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,418
all wavelengths
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

311
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,837
I'm very happy for you. Yeah.

312
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,465
-Where's our daughter?
-Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

313
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:07,758
Wherever you were.

314
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,051
-Where were you?
-Who's Kamala?

315
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,261
The third person we're switching with.

316
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,932
-Light powers. Teenage girl. Where were you?
-What are you doing?

317
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,059
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to switch.

318
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,852
-Why isn't it working when I need it to work?
-Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

319
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:19,895
-Danvers, Danvers!
-Hey!

320
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,898
-So confused.
-Tell Kamala that her Abu is very upset.

321
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,566
Where are we going
and why are we going there?

322
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,402
-Carol!
-Carol, where you going?

323
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,373
-Oh, my God!
-Uh-oh!

324
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:41,542
Monica, you gotta fly.

325
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,960
No, no, no. I...

326
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,127
I mean, I know.

327
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,838
But technically, I haven't done that yet!

328
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,422
Yeah, well, you got to now...

329
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,716
or Kamala's not gonna graduate
from high school.

330
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,134
Come on! Use your core!

331
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,973
Oh, jeez.

332
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,933
Hey. Black Girl Magic.

333
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,914
I got you! I got you!

334
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,207
I got you!

335
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:24,751
Oops!

336
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,189
Hold on!

337
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,899
What is happening?

338
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,984
I can't hold on to you while I'm flying.

339
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,697
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

340
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,157
-We're gonna die!
-Hold on!

341
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,159
Hold on! I'm thinking, I'm thinking!

342
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,369
Wait, I have an idea.

343
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,704
Grab on to me!

344
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,959
This had better work!

345
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:09,963
Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

346
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,763
Okay, no powers, no powers. Just...

347
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,276
Who are they?

348
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:35,030
They are associates of Captain Marvel.

349
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,284
The Annihilator is here?

350
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:43,121
Yeah, well, she was.
And then these two just sort of appeared.

351
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,331
What about the band?

352
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,083
If she's meddling, I need to strike now.

353
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:49,461
Yeah. I still can't account for the
instabilities exhibited on MB-418.

354
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,382
-This thing does much more than just...
-But it works?

355
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,009
Yes. Yes. But if you give me more time...

356
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,845
-I can make it safer.
-No.

357
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,847
No. We do it now.

358
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,141
Before the Annihilator appears.

359
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:24,830
What should we do about... these two?

360
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,387
You.

361
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,183
Hold that thought.

362
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,047
We gotta get that band off of her.

363
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,882
It looks like mine.

364
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,133
Guys!

365
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,853
I can't fly.

366
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,398
Do you guys have
a spaceship I could borrow or...

367
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,608
Kamala, don't talk to them.

368
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,693
You know my name!

369
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,997
The Kree came here hopeful...

370
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,501
-that we could build a covenant of peace.
-What have you done?

371
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:56,380
But then you sic the Annihilator on us.

372
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,550
Like we're vermin.

373
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:05,180
Once again,
the Skrull have betrayed the Kree.

374
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:07,391
And for that...

375
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,127
Carol, we gotta get these people out of here.

376
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,212
Emperor Dro'ge...

377
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,381
you need to evacuate your people now.

378
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,093
We have nowhere to go.

379
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,702
Carol, the ships...

380
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:12,998
they're not gonna make it.

381
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,835
Get back to the ship
and don't use your powers.

382
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,545
-But I can help.
-Now.

383
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,436
-Let's go.
-Where's Kamala?

384
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,274
Kamala!

385
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,328
No!

386
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,464
Let's go, let's go!

387
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,436
-Come on!
-Keep moving...

388
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,188
please, please.

389
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,484
-All these people, they're gonna...
-Come on, sweetie.

390
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,320
-No! How can you just leave them here?
-Kamala, now!

391
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,280
We need to save who we can.

392
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,322
Transmission sent.

393
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:57,579
Hey.

394
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,248
This peace treaty...

395
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,291
it was a good thing.

396
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,711
-It was a ruse.
-If it were...

397
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,506
your intervention failed.

398
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:11,134
We don't need your help anymore.

399
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,306
I called a friend.

400
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,183
She can find a safe place for you.

401
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,310
Is that okay?

402
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,646
We have no choice.

403
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,733
Incoming.

404
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,416
Are you all right?

405
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:48,714
Thank you again.

406
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,632
Always.

407
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,968
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

408
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,178
It is unintentional.

409
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,597
Oh, I've been
on some unintentional teams myself.

410
00:34:57,014 --> 00:35:01,727
-I know, but...
-You can stand tall without standing alone.

411
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,605
Take it from me, Marv.

412
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:13,906
Hey.

413
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:16,867
Captain Marvel will fix this.

414
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:18,952
I promise.

415
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,052
Thank you.

416
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,432
May our next meeting be joyful.

417
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:23,517
Breathe.

418
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,698
Do you remember?

419
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,910
When the sun used to shine on Hala?

420
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,706
How beautiful our home was?

421
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,043
Before her?

422
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,177
Before the Annihilator.

423
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,389
I was there.

424
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,856
I heard her lies...

425
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,859
claiming she was there to set us free.

426
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:18,614
But when she destroyed
the Supreme Intelligence...

427
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,200
she destroyed the Kree.

428
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,960
For 30 years I have been fighting
alongside you.

429
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,963
Not only have I brought you peace...

430
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:39,009
but I have found a way
to return Hala to glory.

431
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,094
Supremor!

432
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,055
Supremor!

433
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:49,269
We need more power than that band
can provide if we're to reignite our sun.

434
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:51,563
That amount of energy...

435
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,065
Well, it would kill you.

436
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:55,567
If my life is the cost, so be it.

437
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,444
We will find the other in time, Suprem...

438
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,238
There is no more time.

439
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,950
Hala is out of time.

440
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:26,723
Need a hand?

441
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,395
Yeah.

442
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,617
Will you hand me that laser?
Three micrometres.

443
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:51,373
Wow.

444
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,585
So you can do that
because you walked through a witch hex?

445
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,003
Yep.

446
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,673
When I got blipped back,
they weren't sending us to space anymore.

447
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,968
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

448
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,845
That must have been hard.

449
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,098
Your mom told me that you
always dreamed of going to space.

450
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:09,516
That you had something to prove.

451
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,560
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

452
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:13,812
What?

453
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,564
When you left...

454
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:19,318
you said you'd be back before I knew it.

455
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,615
I meant what I said. I just,
I didn't know...

456
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,367
what I was getting myself into.

457
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:30,037
I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

458
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:34,208
A little girl that hung on your every word.

459
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,421
If you knew...

460
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,674
I was going to come back.

461
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,176
I just...

462
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,678
There was people that needed me.

463
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,181
We needed you, Carol.

464
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:09,493
Hey.

465
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,870
I hope you don't mind.
I didn't have any other clothes.

466
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,705
It's totally fine.

467
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:15,123
Looks good on you.

468
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,086
I...

469
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,421
I'm really sorry...

470
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,673
for the way I spoke to you.

471
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:25,634
Thank you.

472
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,180
I know that this situation isn't ideal...

473
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:33,058
but it is actually nice...

474
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,769
having people on board again.

475
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,857
It gets pretty lonely out here.

476
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:43,485
Anytime you need company, I will be there.
I will drop everything. I will...

477
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,153
I will drop high school.

478
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:46,655
Don't do that.

479
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,907
But can we start again?

480
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,328
Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

481
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:55,914
I am Kamala Khan.

482
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,208
But when I'm fighting crime
on the streets of Jersey City...

483
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,086
I go by Ms. Marvel, and I hope
that's okay, like, copyright-wise.

484
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,880
Because, honestly,
I never thought I'd ever get to meet you.

485
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,965
But now that it's happening and we're,
like, touching each other...

486
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,009
I've realized I should have
asked permission.

487
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:11,388
So, twinsies.

488
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,266
Okay. All right.

489
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,351
Here's what we're gonna do.

490
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,395
-Captain Marvel.
-You need to stop calling me that.

491
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,189
-I used to change your diapers.
-Oh, that was once.

492
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,065
And then I was told
you proceeded to vomit everywhere.

493
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,192
First of all...

494
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,027
it's my ship, so I make the game plan.

495
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,070
Oh, I'm sorry.
When's the last time you led a team?

496
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,697
As early as last week.

497
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:29,740
Goose doesn't count.

498
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,116
Please. You try giving Goose orders.

499
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,326
Oh, my God, we're a team?

500
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,411
-We're not... We're not a team.
-No, no, no, we're not a team.

501
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:38,040
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City...

502
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:41,335
am on a team with Captain Marvel
and Captain Monica Rambeau...

503
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:44,004
who from this point onwards
will now be known as...

504
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:47,049
-Professor Marvel.
-Oh!

505
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,510
-Professor Marvel.
-No.

506
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,971
-No, no, she, she will not. But thank you.
-The Marvels.

507
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:56,183
Now that we've got that out of the way,
team, I've been trying to tell you...

508
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,227
I think I know how she's making
the weird jump points.

509
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:00,395
She has one of these.

510
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:02,814
It's my nani's bangle.

511
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,359
It started glowing really weirdly...

512
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:08,153
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also...

513
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:11,073
it once traveled me through space and time...

514
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:12,950
so that's probably related.

515
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,786
What you're describing is a Quantum Band.

516
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:17,454
I mean, I knew there were two of these.

517
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:19,623
I just did not expect the other one
to be in space.

518
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,960
They're a pair?
How do you have a Quantum Band?

519
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,545
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

520
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:28,757
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.
It's an ancient artifact.

521
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:32,386
So this is what Dar-Benn found on
MB-418.

522
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,264
And then her and Kamala just happened
to stumble into each other?

523
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,015
I mean, what are the chances?

524
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,351
"What you seek is seeking you."

525
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,436
It's inscribed on the bangle.

526
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,605
If the Kree legends are true...

527
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:47,484
the Quantum Bands were used
to create every jump point in the universe.

528
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,861
Teleportation network.

529
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:53,115
Two Quantum Bands working in unison
to connect the galaxy.

530
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:56,618
So that would explain
our switch-y entanglement situation.

531
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:59,663
Yeah, yeah, but Dar-Benn only has one.

532
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,917
She must be overloading it with the
energy from her space hammer thingy.

533
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,043
It's called the Universal Weapon.

534
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,588
Oh, really? I was gonna call it Cosmi-Rod.

535
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:11,800
Either way, she's using it to force
unstable jump points into the grid.

536
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,887
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

537
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,514
She had star charts and maps
on the screens on her ship.

538
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,933
Okay. To where?

539
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:22,811
-To the stars?
-Okay.

540
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:25,397
It's fine. Got a plan.

541
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,482
We will use this.

542
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:29,610
-Is that...?
-A Skrull torture device.

543
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:32,029
And, wait, we put it on our heads?

544
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:35,866
Yes, it's fine.
You use it to access memories.

545
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,701
I've been using it...

546
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:40,329
to regain the memories
that the Kree took from me.

547
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:42,497
Still?

548
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:43,916
Yeah.

549
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,918
But, you know, it has a lot of other uses.

550
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:47,711
It's safe.

551
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:49,671
You might wanna get comfortable.

552
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,680
This is weird.

553
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,058
Wait. Go back.

554
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,812
Her band absorbs your energy
and redirects it.

555
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:09,525
It's like you gave her power
to use against you.

556
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,069
Kamala?

557
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,030
What about this?

558
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,950
There! Those coordinates.
Can you read that?

559
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,785
Yes. The Magellanic Galaxy.

560
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,122
All right, the pilot seat's all you.

561
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:27,334
Is that you, Monica? You're so cute!

562
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:29,753
No, wait.

563
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,088
Carol, what are you doing?

564
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,301
Why'd you ask me to come, Maria?

565
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:37,427
Mom.

566
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:40,889
The cancer's back.

567
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,268
So I need you to take care of Goose.

568
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:47,396
-No.
-What do you mean "no?"

569
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:49,314
No, I mean, you beat it once.
You'll beat it again.

570
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,440
Carol...

571
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:53,360
-I'm not taking the cat.
-It's not a cat.

572
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:57,281
It should've been you that day.

573
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:00,200
That stupid race to the hangar.

574
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,494
I never wanted to be Captain Marvel.

575
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,664
Captain Rambeau suits me just fine.

576
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:08,750
And it's just until Monica gets back.

577
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,421
She blipped.

578
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,131
Carol, I don't wanna relive this.

579
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:15,382
I'm sorry.

580
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:21,513
Stop now, please, Carol!

581
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,348
Remember why you're out there.

582
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,268
-I'm looking for a patient in room 104.
-I don't know. I don't know what to tell you.

583
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,978
And remember to come home.

584
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:30,314
Your mom, she died, honey.

585
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,191
No. No, no, no!

586
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:38,322
Never do that again.

587
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,324
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

588
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,450
Wait, so your mom...

589
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:44,203
Passed away while I was blipped.

590
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,079
And when I came back...

591
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,956
no one was there.

592
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,756
Okay.

593
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:04,556
Thank you.

594
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,062
She seemed really cool. I'm sorry.

595
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:11,855
She was.

596
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:13,482
She was the best.

597
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:18,904
Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

598
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:21,865
Here is what we do know.

599
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,201
The Universal Neural Teleportation Network...

600
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,871
is a system of wormholes through
the space-time continuum aka, jump points...

601
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,707
which allows us to hop
between different planetary systems.

602
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:34,545
Basically, it stretches and reconfigures
space without rupturing the continuum.

603
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:37,840
Like fracking, the more holes you drill...

604
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,552
the more destabilized the shale becomes
and then... earthquake.

605
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:46,056
Bottom line, if she keeps creating
these jump points...

606
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:47,850
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

607
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:50,561
Question is, what does she want?

608
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,606
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree, so...

609
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,316
maybe the attack was a warning?

610
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,443
So, she could be after another former colony?

611
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,237
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

612
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:04,408
At one point the Kree colonized 25%
of the galaxy, so...

613
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,493
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax...

614
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:09,121
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

615
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:10,330
Why a jump point?

616
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,500
You're right. Jump points aren't weapons,
they're means of transportation.

617
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,335
Every jump point has two sides...

618
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:17,713
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away...

619
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,549
-it had to go somewhere, or...
-Hala.

620
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,303
The Kree Civil War...

621
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,430
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

622
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:27,764
The air is barely breathable...

623
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,725
-they're suffering from a drought.
-A drought?

624
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,894
So, she could be after water next.

625
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:35,814
-Okay. Where in the Magellanic can we find...
-Aladna.

626
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,943
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

627
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,779
That is a very specific stat.
You've been there.

628
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,200
Yeah.

629
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:47,868
Yeah.

630
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,122
She said that really weird.

631
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,290
-Yeah. Why are you being weird?
-Okay.

632
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,083
Consensus on Aladna.

633
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,005
-Aye.
-Yeah, I say we do it.

634
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:02,966
Get to Aladna
and separate Dar-Benn from that bangle.

635
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:04,593
We have our heading.

636
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:09,306
Kamala, you are not going
on any space adventures.

637
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:12,142
Nicholas has told me
how dangerous they can be.

638
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:14,603
It's just "Fury." God.

639
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:16,438
Wait. Where are you guys? Where is Abu?

640
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,446
Hell? So that means I'm the devil?

641
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,241
-Really, Fury?
-They insisted,

642
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,993
and your dad is not adjusting very well
to space travel.

643
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:33,789
Hey, babe, so I'm in this crazy
space elevator and we're going up.

644
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:37,334
Or maybe we're going down.

645
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,878
-Are there directions in space?
-Yes, there are.

646
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,296
But no filming.

647
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:42,881
Oh. Okay.

648
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:45,092
Help me.

649
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:47,135
Whoa.

650
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,728
Fury, everything okay?

651
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,063
We've had another surge.

652
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:00,190
Reports are coming in across the network.

653
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:01,900
It seems everyone's been affected.

654
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,653
Well, we need to stop her
from making another one...

655
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:07,406
and we can't risk intergalactic body swapping
in the meantime.

656
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:10,909
Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry, but your daughter
will have to stay aboard my ship...

657
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,661
-until we can get to the bottom of this.
-Oh, no, no, no.

658
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:13,662
Yes!

659
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,080
You will let her go.

660
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:18,417
Mrs. Khan, it is not that simple.

661
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:20,335
We need Kamala.

662
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,462
Ammi, we found Nani's other bangle...

663
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:24,423
and there's this weirdly beautiful
but kind of terrifying woman...

664
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:26,592
using the other one to hurt people.
And we have to stop her.

665
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:27,968
You're telling me there's another bangle.

666
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:30,721
And they're going to use that bangle
to hurt you?

667
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:31,847
Monica will take care of her.

668
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:35,309
We will. And we will make sure
she gets back home in one piece.

669
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:36,518
I promise.

670
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:38,020
Stay the course.

671
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:40,689
We'll figure out
how to close those jump points.

672
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,400
Kamala, you listen to me.

673
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:44,902
If anything happens to you...

674
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:47,905
You tell her that.

675
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:51,241
I love you, beta.

676
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,492
I love you more.

677
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,661
-Wait, what did she just say?
-Nothing.

678
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:58,457
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel...

679
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,042
and nobody gets more grief for it.

680
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,253
Trust me. Kamala is in good hands with Carol.

681
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:08,967
What's wrong with that cat?

682
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:11,386
It's acting very weird.

683
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:14,473
Also, Mr. Fury, she's looking little pudgy.

684
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,600
I think you're overfeeding her.

685
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:19,353
Goose.

686
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,028
Firefly? Night Light.

687
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:29,821
Countess Marvel. Mistress Marvel?

688
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,156
-Doctor Marvel?
-That's too much.

689
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:32,741
Doctor Bright.

690
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:34,868
Professor Marvel.

691
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,912
Nova, Supernova Girl...

692
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,163
-Spectrum, Spectrum-Vision.
-You're doing too much.

693
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,332
Vision! Oh, wait.
No. Sorry.

694
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:42,459
How many times do I have to tell you guys
I do not want...

695
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:44,461
-or need a code name?
-Why?

696
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:47,256
Besides, none of it matters
if we're not coordinated out there.

697
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:48,465
Wanna figure out the switching thing?

698
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:53,595
Powers stay activated after a switch.
Good to know.

699
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,722
Okay, everyone together on three.

700
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:59,017
Ready? One, two, three, go.

701
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:01,103
Now, why would you say "go"
if we're going on three?

702
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,354
I'm aware.

703
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:09,862
Now.

704
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:11,446
Now.

705
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:12,656
Now.

706
00:51:13,156 --> 00:51:14,157
One, two, three!

707
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:17,744
She gave me eyes.

708
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:23,000
Now. Now.

709
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:24,751
Can you hold on for one second?

710
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:26,795
Walk. And switch!

711
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:29,840
Switch!

712
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:34,761
Hey, I got this!

713
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:43,353
Yes!

714
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,441
And switch!

715
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:52,613
That's why you wanna invest in index funds
rather than in individual stocks.

716
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:57,159
Of course, both a Roth IRA and 401k
are important for tax purposes.

717
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,494
You know, I never even thought
about planning for retirement.

718
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,163
Hey, it's never too late.

719
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,498
And it's never too early, like I say.

720
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:05,501
-How old are you?
-306.

721
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,252
Wow. Same age.

722
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,466
What was that?

723
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,218
-I'm gonna find out.
-Please.

724
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,553
Foreign object in sector K.

725
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:18,764
-Sweet Svartalfheim.
-Don't touch it.

726
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:22,100
What is it?

727
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:23,894
I haven't the foggiest idea.

728
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:26,104
-How did it get in there?
-I don't know.

729
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,358
Should we tell Fury?

730
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:33,487
Twenty seconds to the jump point.

731
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:34,988
Do you guys realize
how crazy this is right now?

732
00:52:35,197 --> 00:52:37,241
Like, I'm in a spaceship
with two superheroes.

733
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,617
Also, is it too late to go
to the bathroom?

734
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:40,285
Because I feel like
it's gonna hit really soon.

735
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:41,453
No one would believe me. Like my...

736
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,871
Nakia, she would never...

737
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:41,680
Okay. Here we go. Comms.

738
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,098
Wow!

739
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,642
-I've always wanted one of these.
-Thank you.

740
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:48,520
-Testing. Testing, one, two, three.
-Kamala. Kamala.

741
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,814
We hear you, baby. Thank you.

742
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:54,985
So, real quick before we get sucked in...

743
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:56,195
What the hell is that?

744
00:53:56,778 --> 00:54:00,199
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

745
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:02,993
Well, you do know
you're famous everywhere, right?

746
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:06,830
This one's kinda different.
I helped the prince with a legal issue.

747
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:07,873
Okay.

748
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,208
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

749
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:10,334
No matter what...

750
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,585
follow my lead.

751
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,587
Aladnean culture is very specific.

752
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:16,548
So, there's gonna be a bit of a
ceremony we have to do...

753
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:17,841
but just... stay cool.

754
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:20,093
Fair Aladna...

755
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:23,222
it's a peaceful crossroads

756
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,766
Diamond of the quadrant...

757
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:28,810
Aladna, our home

758
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,395
Hi, small child, could you tell...

759
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,648
Fair Aladna...

760
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:36,193
as if no time has passed

761
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:39,196
So excited that you're home

762
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:43,867
Our princess is home

763
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:44,910
Princess?

764
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:51,500
It's a technicality.

765
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,126
Carol. What is happening?

766
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,461
Their language is Song.

767
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:56,463
Most of them won't understand you
unless you sing. Come on.

768
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,634
Going to the banquet
Prince Yan's at the banquet

769
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:02,261
Going to the banquet
Prince Yan's at the banquet

770
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,513
Hi. Oh, hi, hello.

771
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:07,391
Going to the banquet
Going to the banquet

772
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:10,894
Where's the prince? Where's the prince?
Hey, hey, hey

773
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:14,106
Going, going, going, going
Going to the banquet

774
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,526
Going, going, going, going
Going to the banquet

775
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:21,613
Why aren't you guys dancing?

776
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:22,781
I am dancing.

777
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,992
Dancing is life

778
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:26,743
Oh, we're almost there.

779
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:31,748
How angelic.
Hi... Okay. All right.

780
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:33,375
Wow.

781
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,630
Oh, my gosh,
give me some of what they're having.

782
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:41,550
-If you tell anyone about...
-What?

783
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,719
That you're a pretty, pretty princess?

784
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:47,931
So, that's what you meant
when you said "legal issue."

785
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:51,143
It is a marriage of convenience.
It's more of a diplomatic act, you know?

786
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,687
It's like, there was a power struggle.
Matriarchal society.

787
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:57,065
We are friends. It's a long story.

788
00:55:57,482 --> 00:55:58,942
Maybe you could sing it.

789
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:00,986
Maybe not.

790
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,279
We're here.

791
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:09,995
Damn.

792
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:12,247
-You saw them arrive
-Oh, hello

793
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,751
Well, okay, I see why you like
to come here.

794
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:24,051
-Attention
-Yes

795
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:29,264
A pleasure to announce
To this lovely roomful

796
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,767
Two new faces

797
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:36,855
One could be more cheerful

798
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:39,358
Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha

799
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:42,569
But nonetheless, we ring the bells

800
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:46,823
To usher in, who, pray tell?

801
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:48,242
None other than

802
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:52,037
One, two, three

803
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:58,210
The Marvels!

804
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,419
The Marvels

805
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:00,295
The Marvels?

806
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:01,380
Yes!

807
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,382
How is that even a thing already?

808
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:06,218
-Okay, let's be cool.
-Where's the prince?

809
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,481
That's...

810
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:21,525
What the hell?

811
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,199
-What is she doing?
-She's respecting the flow.

812
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:39,459
How long

813
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:42,713
do I have with my dance partner this time?

814
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:44,840
Yan...
we are all in danger

815
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:46,341
What is happening?

816
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,342
What?

817
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:50,012
-The Captain needs our help
-Help!

818
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,680
Dar-Benn is coming

819
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,140
I'm feeling so many feelings right now.

820
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:55,934
Oh, Aladna's not afraid of her

821
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:58,979
Invite her down
put her feet on the ground

822
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,397
Give me a chance here...

823
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:04,985
-before it gets too messy
-So lead the wolf inside our walls

824
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:07,070
And trust that you alone...

825
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,740
-can stop an army?
-Have I ever let you down?

826
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:11,825
How many chapters of your Captain Marvel
fan fiction is this giving you?

827
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,368
I'm not about to start...

828
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:14,328
So many.

829
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:15,329
and don't forget...

830
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,206
Don't forget

831
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:22,044
I'm not alone

832
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:26,715
Monica.

833
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:35,516
My Princess from the star...

834
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:38,602
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Stop. Please stop.
We need to talk.

835
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:39,978
-Okay, let's talk.
-Okay.

836
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:42,022
Oh, wait. He doesn't have to sing?

837
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,190
Yeah, he's bilingual.

838
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:45,067
We are severely underdressed.

839
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:48,070
But could you get us
something a little more battle-ready?

840
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,530
Of course.

841
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:50,989
Thank you.

842
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,245
Theories so far?

843
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:58,330
At best, a one-off pest problem.

844
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:02,084
At worst, an enemy plant.

845
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,503
Some kinda infestation bioweapon.

846
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,964
Or it could be from a traitor from within.

847
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:11,802
Well, let's not go there yet.
This... egg you say...

848
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:15,305
let's just continue to study it,
and if anything...

849
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:18,767
Warning. Twenty-nine new objects detected.

850
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:23,146
Oh, my God.

851
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:28,026
What about Lady of Light?

852
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:30,320
-Frequency. Pulsar.
-No. No.

853
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:31,780
Pulsar Light Lady.

854
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:34,157
Absolutely not. These...
These are too much, right?

855
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:35,158
-Definitely.
-No.

856
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:47,629
We make this quick. Nothing grandiose.

857
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:50,340
You three need to disappear. But stay close.

858
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:51,550
My specialty.

859
00:59:58,724 --> 00:59:59,725
This will work, Yan.

860
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:04,521
Remember, we wanna keep
unintentional switching to a minimum.

861
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,316
Entertain her as long as you possibly can.

862
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,109
Monica and I will get the jump on her.

863
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,194
And we'll get the bangle.

864
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:15,032
It's time.

865
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:19,680
Supremor, why have you come?

866
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:24,434
I've come here to pardon you
for your crimes against the Kree Empire.

867
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:26,270
Kneel.

868
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:27,688
To you?

869
01:01:29,898 --> 01:01:32,109
-I will never kneel.
-Okay.

870
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:01,597
Damn it!

871
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:26,205
Use your scarf.

872
01:02:44,598 --> 01:02:45,599
Go!

873
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:55,901
I found her.

874
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:13,585
Monica, where are you?

875
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:21,468
Monica, tag me in.

876
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:23,136
One, two...

877
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:25,097
Don't do this.

878
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:26,473
You're too late.

879
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:06,930
Where did you get that?

880
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:09,975
My grandma, she sent it to me in the mail.

881
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,562
-Give it to me.
-Kamala, run.

882
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:15,314
Get to the ship.

883
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:32,206
With this, your powers
only make me stronger.

884
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:57,564
The surges are frying our systems.

885
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:58,941
Are we doing something about these?

886
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:00,234
The space elevator's offline.

887
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:01,610
You ever come in here with good news?

888
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,821
Half the evacuation pods just went down.

889
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,990
That's not good news.

890
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:41,817
Are you guys in?

891
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,026
In.

892
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:46,405
Redirect all fighters.

893
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,251
Disengaging autopilot.

894
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,968
Oh, my God.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

895
01:06:11,555 --> 01:06:12,472
Monica?

896
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:16,351
Monica, we're going down, Monica!

897
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,315
I thought you could drive this thing!

898
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,566
Carol! Get down here.

899
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:23,984
Hold that thought.

900
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:25,152
Can you believe this woman?

901
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:33,869
O, Captain! My Captain!

902
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,796
-No, no, no!
-Move over.

903
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:55,599
I'm activating a jump point.

904
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:58,143
-No, I can lose her.
-And what about the other 20 ships?

905
01:06:58,268 --> 01:06:59,269
I can do this.

906
01:07:05,317 --> 01:07:06,652
-Missile lock.
-Guys?

907
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:08,237
Missile lock.

908
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,665
Incoming missiles.

909
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:21,416
-Impact in five...
-We need to leave now.

910
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:22,584
-I can't let this happen again.
-four...

911
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,544
-It already has.
-three, two...

912
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,046
-I can do this.
-And you'll kill us trying.

913
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:28,382
Jump point activated.

914
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,695
We left Aladna to fend for themselves.

915
01:07:49,903 --> 01:07:51,321
Dar-Benn was gonna get my bangle.

916
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:53,615
So I made a tough call
like you did on Tarnax.

917
01:07:53,782 --> 01:07:56,660
Don't try to be like me.
I messed this whole thing up.

918
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:58,120
If we weren't entangled...

919
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,872
if we weren't here,
then you could have beat Dar-Benn.

920
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,123
And I'm sorry.

921
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:05,752
No, you don't understand.

922
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:09,339
The Kree had been ruled by an AI
for a millennia...

923
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:10,924
that led them into a war.

924
01:08:11,133 --> 01:08:14,344
And I thought the only way to stop it
was to destroy it.

925
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:16,430
But I just...

926
01:08:17,347 --> 01:08:18,599
made it worse.

927
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:22,644
I'm the reason why the civil war
started in the first place...

928
01:08:22,811 --> 01:08:25,689
I'm the reason why they
couldn't breathe the air.

929
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:28,275
That's how I got the name Annihilator.

930
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:32,988
And I never wanted you to see
that version of me.

931
01:08:36,575 --> 01:08:38,452
Is that why you never came back?

932
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,579
I thought if I fixed it...

933
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,539
then I could come home.

934
01:08:43,582 --> 01:08:44,666
Carol.

935
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:48,670
That's not how family works.

936
01:08:50,422 --> 01:08:54,092
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

937
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:57,387
I just wanted you.

938
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:00,599
My aunt.

939
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:08,106
I'm really glad that you're here now.

940
01:09:14,988 --> 01:09:16,657
And you, too.

941
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:18,909
I'm glad to be here.

942
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:23,622
I hope that goes without saying.
And I am sorry...

943
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:25,999
for coming on too strong at the beginning.

944
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,001
I did not give you a lot of space
to be a real person.

945
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:34,591
We have to find her.

946
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,343
I mean, but she could be anywhere.

947
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,137
No, not anywhere.

948
01:09:40,138 --> 01:09:41,932
She's targeting the people
that I care about...

949
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,726
and stealing resources
from every place I call home.

950
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:47,646
We have to warn Fury.

951
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,612
This is an emergency.

952
01:09:55,737 --> 01:10:00,617
All S.A.B.E.R. personnel must report
to an evacuation pod immediately. Walk.

953
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:02,744
-Do not run.
-We only have one evacuation bay online.

954
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:03,996
Which means that all we have left...

955
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:06,623
to evacuate 350 personnel
are 15 escape pods...

956
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:08,917
which seat five, 10, if we squeeze.
It's nowhere near enough.

957
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,587
Well, fill the remaining ones
with as many people as you can...

958
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:15,215
-then come up with a Plan B.
-This is an emergency. All S.A.B.E.R...

959
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,560
No, no, no.

960
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:28,270
Aamir. Go help them.

961
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:29,229
Okay, okay. Okay.

962
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:32,941
I got this.

963
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,031
My living room.

964
01:10:40,032 --> 01:10:41,033
Goose?

965
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:54,880
Goose, how'd you...

966
01:10:55,714 --> 01:10:58,342
Come here. Come. Come on.

967
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:01,345
Yes. Yes. Come here. Look at you.

968
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:04,348
Look!

969
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:05,641
Oh, no, not my good eye!

970
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:09,561
We only have one escape pod left.

971
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:11,146
We're doomed.

972
01:11:12,606 --> 01:11:13,857
In the end...

973
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:17,027
none of us choose how we transition
from this life...

974
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:18,695
to the next.

975
01:11:18,946 --> 01:11:20,739
What? No!

976
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:22,824
Get everyone to the evacuation deck.

977
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:23,992
Now!

978
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,292
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

979
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:34,294
What are we doing?

980
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:36,380
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

981
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:37,923
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

982
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:40,592
-I can't. Can you?
-I got it.

983
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,264
What is going on, fam?

984
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:46,765
Kamala?

985
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:48,976
Kamala! Yusuf, Kamala!

986
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:51,770
Kamala! Kamala!

987
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,815
You're back safely, beta.

988
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,149
You're not dead.

989
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,151
I've lost contact with Earth.

990
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,529
We're officially at abandon-ship phase.

991
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:05,993
Spit him out.

992
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,578
-Spit him out.
-No, no, no.

993
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:09,079
No. That's the plan.

994
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:11,748
-That's the plan?
-It's much easier...

995
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,335
to transport a family of cats
than hundreds of crew members.

996
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:17,254
So, we're literally herding cats?

997
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:23,010
Come here, kitty.

998
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,971
Attention, S.A.B.E.R. crew.

999
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,057
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1000
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:30,726
You will be fine.

1001
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:42,905
S.A.B.E.R. crew.

1002
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:46,158
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1003
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:48,619
Stop running.

1004
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:04,426
I'm sorry.

1005
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:12,351
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1006
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:14,728
Stop running.

1007
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:36,750
Guys, I found her.

1008
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:40,420
-Come on. Come on, move.
-Hey! Come on.

1009
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:41,588
Come on, come here.

1010
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,509
-Go, go, go.
-Come on, come on.

1011
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:47,845
-Go to the spacecraft bay.
-Okay. Come on.

1012
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:49,972
Come on.
Yusuf, stop with your belt.

1013
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:06,947
Nope. No. No, no, no. Thank you. No.

1014
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:09,199
Come, come, come.

1015
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:20,669
Don't you worry, little one.
Here, go to Kamala. Go to Kamala.

1016
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:25,924
-There you go, come, come.
-I found Dar-Benn.

1017
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,092
What?

1018
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:29,261
She wants our sun.

1019
01:14:56,955 --> 01:14:58,081
You leavin' again?

1020
01:14:58,832 --> 01:14:59,875
Yeah.

1021
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:01,960
Ammi, the universe isn't safe.

1022
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:04,087
And if the universe isn't safe,
that means you guys aren't safe.

1023
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:05,464
And if you guys aren't...

1024
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:07,424
Listen to me.

1025
01:15:08,133 --> 01:15:11,803
You are chosen for a greater purpose, okay?

1026
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,847
So, of course you must go now.

1027
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,893
But I will never let you go.

1028
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,103
You understand that, right?

1029
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:26,652
-Yeah.
-Come back safely, beta.

1030
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:29,613
You better.
I don't wanna be an only child.

1031
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,990
Not again. Not with these two.

1032
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:38,163
You think it's wise taking that bangle
to the bad guy?

1033
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,874
Yes. Mr. Fury's right. Give it to me.
I will take it home.

1034
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:42,960
Dar-Benn's opened another jump point...

1035
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:45,170
and we're gonna need both bangles
to close it.

1036
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:48,298
Then I guess you'd better make damn sure
she doesn't get her hands on it.

1037
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:50,509
Understood.

1038
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:09,987
Oh, God, Mr. Fury...

1039
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:13,282
-you are going in the wrong direction!
-Mrs. Khan, I know!

1040
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:19,496
-You did it, Mr. Fury!
-I didn't do anything.

1041
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,334
Are you praying?

1042
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:27,754
Don't stop! We need all the help we can get!

1043
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:29,673
Amen!

1044
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:32,009
Amen!

1045
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:33,385
Holy cow!

1046
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,762
Mr. Fury!

1047
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:29,525
There she is...

1048
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:32,194
the Annihilator herself.

1049
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:33,904
It's over, Dar-Benn.

1050
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:35,364
No, not yet.

1051
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:38,116
I know that you would do anything
to protect Hala.

1052
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:42,120
This will be the end of the Kree.
It will be the end of everything.

1053
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:45,457
You took from me.
I'm simply repaying the favor.

1054
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,336
Now, give me the band.

1055
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:51,922
You're forgetting something.

1056
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:53,924
-What?
-Me.

1057
01:18:08,272 --> 01:18:11,650
This could have been so much easier.

1058
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,528
I don't know. I like our odds.

1059
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:37,402
You're living up to your name again.

1060
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:40,072
I didn't want this.

1061
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:41,990
Death seems to follow you.

1062
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:50,791
It doesn't have to end like this, Dar-Benn.

1063
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,125
Please, just give us the bangle.

1064
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,210
I won't!

1065
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:57,589
Hala's sun died because of you.

1066
01:19:57,798 --> 01:19:59,299
Why shouldn't you repay us?

1067
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:02,511
Maybe she should.

1068
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:07,099
The reaction in your sun's core has slowed.

1069
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:09,518
It needs an incredible amount of energy
to jump-start it...

1070
01:20:09,643 --> 01:20:11,395
and that's what you have, Carol.

1071
01:20:12,396 --> 01:20:15,315
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1072
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:18,777
But I've never done anything
like that before.

1073
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,947
In the last couple of days I have done
a lot of things I have never done before.

1074
01:20:23,574 --> 01:20:24,867
You got this.

1075
01:20:30,497 --> 01:20:31,665
For Hala.

1076
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:37,880
For Hala.

1077
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:57,774
Try anything
and I'll kill her faster than you can move.

1078
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:03,739
Carol!

1079
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:08,827
No!

1080
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,302
You won't survive this.

1081
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,888
Dar-Benn, listen to me.

1082
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:13,183
Are you okay?

1083
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:15,477
Yeah.

1084
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:18,397
I didn't switch.

1085
01:22:18,897 --> 01:22:19,898
One, two, three.

1086
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,593
I'm so glad you're okay.

1087
01:22:48,468 --> 01:22:49,678
You got the bangles.

1088
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:53,390
We are gonna need those.

1089
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:58,562
Okay, come on, Princess.

1090
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:06,028
So, what are we looking at?

1091
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:08,989
A self-propagating singularity
with negative mass...

1092
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:10,699
and non-Newtonian topology.

1093
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:15,579
She tore a hole in space-time.

1094
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:21,543
That is a different reality
bleeding into ours.

1095
01:23:22,085 --> 01:23:23,253
Can we even fix that?

1096
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,632
In theory, you and Carol can reproduce
the same amount of energy...

1097
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:28,300
that was used to open it.

1098
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:31,220
I will absorb it and then release it,
but from inside the tear.

1099
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:32,930
But what about the switching?

1100
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:35,599
Our powers aren't entangled anymore.

1101
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:41,438
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1102
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,984
But, wait. You want us to blast you
with the same amount of power...

1103
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:48,570
that punched a hole in the fabric
of space-time?

1104
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:52,366
If we wanna un-punch it, yeah.

1105
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:54,076
Monica...

1106
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:56,954
You're gonna need this.

1107
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,630
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

1108
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,717
These bangles traveled
through space and time.

1109
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:12,219
To find me.

1110
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:15,639
I was born for this.

1111
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,478
It has to be now.

1112
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,230
Your mom would be proud.

1113
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:07,816
Higher, further, faster.

1114
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,112
Higher, further, faster.

1115
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,713
It's closing, Monica.
You've got to get out of there.

1116
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,591
I can't leave, Carol.

1117
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:16,009
What? What do you mean?

1118
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,344
I can't leave.

1119
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:18,679
I have to finish the job.

1120
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:20,722
No! Monica, it's closing.
You'll be trapped!

1121
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:22,391
It's okay.

1122
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,326
Come on.

1123
01:26:45,205 --> 01:26:47,207
Always knew I would have to stay.

1124
01:27:55,234 --> 01:27:56,568
Kamala.

1125
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:04,743
Kamala, you saved
the world.

1126
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:12,709
Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?

1127
01:28:17,256 --> 01:28:18,549
What happened?

1128
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:21,552
We lost Monica.

1129
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:26,765
She got stuck on the other side.

1130
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:28,725
And Carol?

1131
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:33,981
She went to fulfill a promise.

1132
01:29:58,732 --> 01:29:59,900
How are things?

1133
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,195
The planets are expected
to make a full recovery.

1134
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:06,073
And a team of scientists are being sent
to Hala to try and help their people.

1135
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,866
That's not what I meant.

1136
01:30:31,181 --> 01:30:34,476
This says "Kitchen," but there are
all these hot sauce packets...

1137
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:37,813
And then there's
this very bizarre-looking tray...

1138
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:40,858
which I will say is
a very good quality, though.

1139
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,025
You can keep it.

1140
01:30:42,192 --> 01:30:43,443
-Oh, no, no, Carol, I just...
-Where else would they go?

1141
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:45,863
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was for me.

1142
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:50,117
The vastness of it just gives you
a whole new perspective on life.

1143
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:52,202
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1144
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:53,829
And it was surprisingly cool.

1145
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:59,585
This place is amazing.

1146
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,295
Yeah, it is.

1147
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:04,214
Hey, do you still fly that thing?

1148
01:31:05,048 --> 01:31:06,216
-You wanna check it out?
-I do.

1149
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:07,342
All right.

1150
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:10,721
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

1151
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:15,017
-I'm so happy that you're home safe, beta.
-Okay.

1152
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:21,940
Aamir...

1153
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:25,777
this would be a lovely house
to raise a family in, you know?

1154
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:28,405
Aamir.

1155
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:30,324
This is so cool.

1156
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:32,242
Pilot seat's all you.

1157
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:43,128
Let's fly this thing.

1158
01:31:43,712 --> 01:31:45,672
I actually don't have the key.

1159
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,841
I'm just looking after it.

1160
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:51,470
Just until Monica gets back?

1161
01:31:52,095 --> 01:31:53,263
Yeah.

1162
01:31:54,723 --> 01:31:56,725
Just until Monica gets back.

1163
01:31:57,392 --> 01:31:58,810
I really miss her.

1164
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:01,563
We were good together.

1165
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,982
Which got me thinking...

1166
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:17,496
Pizza delivery.

1167
01:32:22,543 --> 01:32:23,335
Okay.

1168
01:32:29,424 --> 01:32:30,968
Can I help you?

1169
01:32:31,093 --> 01:32:32,553
Kate Bishop.

1170
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,933
Did you think you're
the only kid superhero in the world?

1171
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:41,144
-Well, I'm 23.
-Oh, I know.

1172
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:43,438
I've been reading up on you.

1173
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:45,566
Where did you get that?

1174
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,109
I found it in my couch.

1175
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:48,402
Okay.

1176
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,696
You've just become
part of a much larger universe.

1177
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:55,868
Which, at the moment, is just me, mostly.

1178
01:32:55,993 --> 01:32:56,994
I do have feelers out, though.

1179
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:59,037
-Did you know Ant-Man had a daughter?
-What do you want?

1180
01:32:59,121 --> 01:33:00,831
I'm putting together a team.

1181
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:02,833
And I want you on it.

1182
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:09,756
Please?

1183
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:17,945
Mom?

1184
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:22,449
"Mom"?

1185
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:25,994
-Mom!
-"Mom?"

1186
01:36:26,203 --> 01:36:28,163
I've missed you so much!

1187
01:36:28,288 --> 01:36:29,331
You missed me?

1188
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:32,042
-I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...
-Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

1189
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:35,546
Hey, hey, look at me.
It's okay. You're okay. Hey.

1190
01:36:36,672 --> 01:36:38,841
How's our mysterious visitor?

1191
01:36:39,007 --> 01:36:41,176
She seems a little disoriented.

1192
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:44,012
Where... Where are we? What happened?

1193
01:36:44,179 --> 01:36:46,265
We were hoping you could tell us.

1194
01:36:47,182 --> 01:36:49,476
All we know is that Binary found you.

1195
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:53,897
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

1196
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:56,817
You are now in a reality parallel
to your own.

1197
01:36:57,526 --> 01:37:00,362
Which is, of course, impossible.

1198
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:05,367
I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

1199
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:08,745
Confusion is but the first step
on the journey to knowledge.

1200
01:37:08,954 --> 01:37:11,498
Okay. I'll take it from here.

1201
01:37:11,665 --> 01:37:13,876
Charles asked for an update.

1202
01:37:15,335 --> 01:37:17,045
I'll come by and check on you later.

1203
01:37:28,265 --> 01:37:29,558
Who are you?

1204
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:32,978
Oh, shit.
